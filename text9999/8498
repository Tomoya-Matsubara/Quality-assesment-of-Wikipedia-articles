It is then [[deep-frying|deep-fried]] and can be accompanied with [[salsa (sauce)|salsa]], [[guacamole]], [[sour cream]] and/or cheese. Many restaurants offer non-fried chimichangas, which are similar to normal burrito, with cheese sauce, guacamole, and tomato.

*According to one source,<ref>[http://www.azcentral.com/home/food/mexico/articles/0427chimichange27-CR.html Matteo Marra, "Tales of the chimichanga's origin"]</ref> the founder of the [[Tucson, Arizona]], restaurant El Charro, Monica Flin, accidentally dropped a pastry into the [[deep fryer|deep fat fryer]] in 1922. She immediately began to utter a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[profanity|curse-word]] beginning "chi..." ([[chingada]]), but quickly stopped herself and instead exclaimed ''chimichanga'', a Spanish equivalent of ''[[thingamajig]]''.<ref>[http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Chimichanga.htm Chimichanga History and Recipe]</ref> Fortuitously, the euphemism was a well understood Indianism for the standard Spanish "chango quemado", meaning "burnt monkey".{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

*Other sources claim they were first served in Mexico in the early 1920<U+2019>s. They had been perfected by the Cocreham family, an Irish/Mexican family. Several family members claim to be the inventor of the Chimichanga, but all agree that they came from the <U+201C>Flauta<U+201D> which is rolled with a corn tortilla. It took several flautas to fill one up because the corn tortilla is smaller than a flour tortilla. So to save time to feed her 13 children, Guadalupe Cocreham started using flour tortillas filled with spicy shredded beef. Her children were allowed to garnish them how they liked, thus several of her children claim to be the <U+201C>inventor<U+201D> because of how they garnished their own Chimichanga.

*Woody Johnson, founder of Macayo<U+2019>s Mexican Kitchen, claims he invented the Chimichanga in 1946 when he put some burritos into a deep fryer as an experiment at his original restaurant Woody's El Nido. These <U+201C>fried burritos<U+201D> became so popular that by 1952 when Woody's El Nido became Macayo's the chimichanga was one of the restaurant's main menu items.Johnson opened Macayo's in 1952.<ref name=post/>

*Although no official records indicate when the dish first appeared, retired [[University of Arizona]] folklorist Jim Griffith recalls seeing chimichangas at the Yaqui Old [[Pascua Yaqui Tribe|Pascua]] Village in Tucson in the mid-1950s.<ref>[[Tom Miller (travel writer)|Miller, Tom]]. ''Jack Ruby<U+2019>s Kitchen Sink: Offbeat Travels Through America<U+2019>s Southwest'', p.79.</ref>

*Given the variant ''chivichanga'', mainly employed in Mexico, another derivation would have it that immigrants to the United States brought the dish with them, mainly through Nogales into Arizona. A third, and perhaps most likely possibility, is that the chimichanga, or chivichanga, has long been a part of local cuisine of the [[Pimer<U+00ED>a Alta]] of Arizona and Sonora, with its early range extending southward into Sinaloa. In Sinaloa the chimichangas are small. In any case, it is all but uncontroversial that within the United States, knowledge and appreciation of the dish spread slowly outward from the Tucson area, with popularity elsewhere accelerating in recent decades. Though the chimichanga is now found as part of the [[Tex-Mex]] repertoire, its roots within the U.S. seem to be in [[Pima County]], Arizona.
