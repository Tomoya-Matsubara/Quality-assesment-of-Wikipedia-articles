The '''2010<U+2013>11 [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball]] team''' represents the [[University of Michigan]] during the [[2010<U+2013>11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season]]. The team played its home games in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] at the [[Crisler Arena]], which has a capacity of 13,751, for the forty-fourth consecutive year.<ref>{{vcite web|url=http://www.mgoblue.com/facilities/article.aspx?id=28648|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080524172649/http://www.mgoblue.com/facilities/article.aspx?id=28648|archivedate=2008-05-24|title=Crisler Arena|accessdate=2008-11-15|date=2007-08-14|publisher=University of Michigan & Host Interactive}}</ref>  This season marked the team's ninety-fourth consecutive year as a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]].<ref name=MB07-8p190>{{vcite book|title=2007-08 Men's Basketball Media Guide|publisher=University of Michigan|page=190|year=2007}}</ref>  The team witnessed the departure of its four tallest players and two leading scorers from the prior season.  The incoming class featured the sons of two former [[National Basketball Association]] players ([[Tim Hardaway]] and [[Tito Horford]]) and the younger brother of a current one ([[Al Horford]]).  Additionally [[Joe Dumars]]' son Jordan transferred to the team and [[Glenn Robinson]]'s son verbally committed to the class of 2012.  The season was marked by close losses against numerous highly-ranked teams.

Although the team began with a 1&ndash;6 record in conference play, they rebounded to finish with a 9&ndash;9 conference mark.  This put them in a four-way tie for fourth and earned them a number four seed in the [[2011 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament]].  For the fifth consecutive year they won their first game in the tournament, but lost in the semifinals to eventual champion [[2010<U+2013>11 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team|Ohio State]].  They also earned a number eight seed in the [[2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]], where they logged a record-setting performance in the first game, but lost in their second game (in the round of 32).

The team was [[captain (sports)|captained]] by Zack Novak, who became one of the forty [[Academic All-American]] finalists for the second year in a row, and Stu Douglass.  The team was also led by [[Darius Morris]] and [[Tim Hardaway, Jr.]] who earned third team and honorable mention All-Big Ten recognition, respectively. Hardaway was one of two unanimous Big Ten All-Freshman selections. Hardaway set the school freshman single-season record for [[three point shot]]s made and Morris set the school single-season record for [[assist (basketball)|assists]]. Hardaway was selected to the 2011 [[Collegeinsider.com]] Freshmen All-America team.

On NCAA Tournament selection Sunday, ''[[The Fab Five (film)|The Fab Five]]'' aired and comments it contained brought attention to issues of race in sports and education and the [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]]&ndash;Michigan rivalry.  Past Duke and Michigan players traded barbs in leading national newspapers.  The teams met in the 2011 NCAA tournament the following week with Duke prevailing.
