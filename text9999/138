'''Patriarch Joseph''' II was [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] from 1416-1439. He was the son of [[Ivan Shishman of Bulgaria]]. 

Together with [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[John VIII Palaiologos]], 23 Metropolitan bishops and countless scholars and theologians, he took part in the [[Council of Florence]]. While in [[Florence]], he was quartered in the Palazzo Ferrantini.

Joseph was very old and ill and died within 2 months in [[1439]]. His death caused much grief to all present at the Council, as he was a fervent supporter of union between the Churches. His grave in the [[Dominican order|Dominican]] [[convent]] church of [[Santa Maria Novella]] in [[Florence]] survives, with an elaborate [[fresco]] portrait in a semi-Byzantine style.
