'''''Sense and Sensibility''''' is a 1995 British-American [[period drama]] film directed by [[Ang Lee]] and based on [[Jane Austen]]'s 1811 [[Sense and Sensibility|eponymous novel]]. Actress [[Emma Thompson]] wrote the script and stars as [[Elinor Dashwood]], while [[Kate Winslet]] plays Elinor's younger sister [[Marianne Dashwood|Marianne]]. The story follows the Dashwood sisters <U+2013> though they are members of a wealthy English family of [[landed gentry]], circumstances result in their sudden destitution, forcing them to seek financial security through marriage. Actors [[Hugh Grant]] and [[Alan Rickman]] play their respective suitors. It was released on 13 December 1995 in the United States and on 23 February 1996 in the United Kingdom.

Producer [[Lindsay Doran]], a longtime admirer of Austen's novel, hired Thompson to write the screenplay. The actress spent five years penning numerous revisions, continually working on the script between other films as well as into production of the film itself. Studios were nervous that Thompson <U+2013> a first-time screenwriter <U+2013> was the credited writer, but [[Columbia Pictures]] agreed to distribute the film. Though she initially intended another actress to portray Elinor, Thompson was persuaded to undertake the part herself, despite the wide disparity with her character's age.

Thompson's screenplay exaggerated the Dashwood family wealth to make their later scenes of poverty more apparent to modern audiences. It also altered the  traits of the male leads to make them more appealing to contemporary viewers. Elinor and Marianne's different characteristics were emphasised through imagery and invented scenes. Ang Lee was selected as director, both due to his work in the 1993 film ''[[The Wedding Banquet]]'' and because Doran felt he would help the film appeal to a wider audience. Given a budget of $16 million, Lee approached filming from different perspectives than his cast and crew before the actors grew to trust his instincts.

A commercial success, the film garnered overwhelmingly positive reviews upon release and [[List of accolades received by Sense and Sensibility|received many accolades]], including three awards and eleven nominations at the 1995 [[British Academy Film Awards]]. It earned seven [[Academy Awards]] nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Thompson). The actress received the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], becoming the only person to have won for both acting and writing awards at the Academy Awards. ''Sense and Sensibility'' contributed to a resurgence in popularity for Austen's works, and has led to many more productions in similar genres. It persists in being recognized as one of the best Austen adaptations of all time.

==Plot==
When Mr. Dashwood ([[Tom Wilkinson]]) dies, his wife ([[Gemma Jones]]) and three daughters <U+2013> [[Elinor Dashwood|Elinor]] ([[Emma Thompson]]), [[Marianne Dashwood|Marianne]] ([[Kate Winslet]]) and Margaret ([[Myriam Francois-Cerrah|Emilie Fran<U+00E7>ois]]) <U+2013> are left with an inheritance of only <U+00A3>500 a year; the bulk of his estate, Norland Park, is left to his son John ([[James Fleet]]) from a previous marriage. John and his greedy, snobbish wife Fanny ([[Harriet Walter]]) immediately install themselves in the large house; Fanny invites her brother [[Edward Ferrars]] ([[Hugh Grant]]) to stay with them. She frets about the budding friendship between Edward and Elinor, believing he can do better, and does everything she can to prevent it from developing into a romantic attachment.

Sir John Middleton ([[Robert Hardy]]), a cousin of the widowed Mrs. Dashwood, offers her a small cottage house on his estate, Barton Park in [[Devon]]shire. She and her daughters move in, and are frequent guests at Barton Park. Marianne meets the older Colonel Brandon ([[Alan Rickman]]), who falls in love with her at first sight. Competing for her affections is the dashing but deceitful [[John Willoughby]] ([[Greg Wise]]), with whom Marianne falls in love. On the morning she expects him to propose marriage to her, he instead leaves hurriedly for London. Unbeknown to the Dashwood family, Brandon's ward Beth, illegitimate daughter of his former love Eliza, is pregnant with Willoughby's child, and Willoughby's aunt Lady Allen has disinherited him upon discovering this.

Sir John's mother-in-law, Mrs. Jennings ([[Elizabeth Spriggs]]), invites her daughter and son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ([[Hugh Laurie]] and [[Imelda Staunton]]), to visit. They bring with them the impoverished Lucy Steele ([[Imogen Stubbs]]). Lucy confides in Elinor that she and Edward have been engaged secretly for five years, thus dashing Elinor's hopes of a future with him. Mrs. Jennings takes Lucy, Elinor, and Marianne to London, where they meet Willoughby at a ball. He barely acknowledges their acquaintance, and they learn he is engaged to the extremely wealthy Miss Grey. Marianne becomes inconsolable. The clandestine engagement of Edward and Lucy also comes to light. Edward's mother demands that he break off the engagement. When he honourably refuses, his fortune is taken from him and given to his younger brother Robert ([[Richard Lumsden]]).

On their way home to Devonshire, Elinor and Marianne stop for the night at the country estate of the Palmers, who live near Willoughby. Marianne cannot resist going to see Willoughby's estate and walks a long way in a torrential rain to do so. As a result, she becomes seriously ill and is nursed back to health by Elinor after being rescued by Colonel Brandon. Marianne recovers, and the sisters return home. They learn that Miss Steele has become Mrs. Ferrars and assume that she is married to Edward. However, he arrives to explain that Miss Steele has unexpectedly wed Robert Ferrars and Edward is thus released from his engagement. Edward proposes to Elinor and becomes a [[vicar]], whilst Marianne falls in love with and marries Colonel Brandon.

==Production==

===Conception and adaptation===
In 1989, [[Lindsay Doran]], the new president of production company [[Mirage Enterprises]], was on a company retreat brainstorming potential film ideas when she suggested the [[Jane Austen]] novel ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' to her colleagues.<ref name=ctdoran/> It had been adapted three times prior to the 1995 release, most recently in a [[Sense and Sensibility (1981 TV serial)|1981 television serial]].{{sfn|Parrill|2002|pp=21, 24}} Doran was a longtime fan of the novel,{{sfn|Dole|2001|p=63}} and had vowed in her youth to someday adapt it if she ever entered the film industry.{{sfn|Stempel|2000|p=249}}{{sfn|Doran|1995|p=11}} She chose to adapt this particular Austen work because of the presence of two female leads.{{sfn|Dobie|2003|p=249}} Doran stated, "All of [Austen's] books are funny and emotional, but ''Sense and Sensibility'' is the best movie story because it's full of twists and turns. Just when you think you know what's going on, everything is different. It's got real suspense, but it's not a thriller. Irresistible."<ref name=ctdoran>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-03-17/features/9603170023_1_sense-and-sensibility-jane-austen-lindsay-doran |title=Book sense; Lindsay Doran kept her sites on bringing 'Sense And Sensibility' to the screen |first=Nancy |last=Mills |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=17 March 1996 |accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> She also praised the novel for possessing "wonderful characters&nbsp;... ''three'' strong love stories, surprising plot twists, good jokes, relevant themes, and a heart-stopping ending."{{sfn|Doran|1995|p=11}}

Prior to her hire at Mirage, the producer had spent years looking for a suitable screenwriter{{sfn|Stempel|2000|p=249}} <U+2013> someone who was "equally strong in the areas of satire and romance" and could think in Austen's language "almost as naturally as he or she could think in the language of the twentieth century."{{sfn|Doran|1995|p=11}} Doran read screenplays by English and American writers{{sfn|Doran|1995|p=12}} until she came across a [[Thompson (TV series)|series of comedic skits]], often in period settings, that actress Emma Thompson had written.<ref name=dailybeastlunch>{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1995/12/17/jane-austen-does-lunch.html |title=Jane Austen does lunch |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |date=17 December 1995 |accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref><ref name=chicagotribune1>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-01-05/entertainment/9601050033_1_sensibility-interviews-journalists |title=Thompson sees a lot of sense in Jane Austen's sensibilities |first=Joe |last=Leydon |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=5 January 1996 |accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref> Doran believed the humour and style of writing was "exactly what [she'd] been searching for."{{sfn|Doran|1995|p=13}} Thompson and Doran were already working together on Mirage's 1991 film ''[[Dead Again]]''; a week after its completion, the producer selected Thompson to adapt ''Sense and Sensibility'',<ref name=ctdoran/> despite knowing that Thompson had never written a screenplay before.{{sfn|Doran|1995|p=13}} A lover of Austen herself, Thompson first suggested they adapt ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' or ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'' before agreeing to Doran's proposal.{{sfn|Doran|1995|pp=12<U+2013>13}}<ref name=HuffPostNannyMcPhee>{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/melissa-silverstein/interview-with-lindsay-do_b_692344.html |title=Interview with Lindsay Doran: Producer Nanny McPhee returns |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |first=Melissa |last=Silverstein |date=24 August 2010 |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref> The actress found that ''Sense and Sensibility'' contained more action than she had remembered, and decided it would translate well to drama.{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=209}}
[[File:Emma Thompson C<U+00E9>sars 2009.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Emma Thompson]] worked on the ''Sense and Sensibility'' screenplay for four years.]]
Thompson spent five years writing and revising the screenplay, both during and in between shooting other films.{{sfn|Stempel|2000|p=249}}{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=208}}{{sfn|Parrill|2002|p=6}} Believing the novel's language to be "far more arcane than in [Austen's] later books," Thompson sought to simplify the dialogue while retaining the "elegance and wit of the original."{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=252}} She observed that in a screenwriting process, a first draft often had "a lot of good stuff in it" but needed to be edited down, and second drafts would "almost certainly be rubbish&nbsp;... because you get into a panic."{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=01:33:00<U+2013>01:33:25}} Thompson credits Doran for "help[ing] me, nourish[ing] me and mentor[ing] me through that process&nbsp;... I learned about screenwriting at her feet."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/ae/movies/emma-thompson-on-child-rearing-screenwriting-and-acting-260719/ |title=Emma Thompson on child rearing, screenwriting and acting |first=Carrie |last=Rickey |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=23 August 2010 |accessdate=26 April 2013}}</ref>

Thompson's first draft was more than three-hundred handwritten pages, which required her to edit it down to a more manageable length.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1308993761.html |title=A sensible screenplay |first=Jim |last=Welsh |work=Literature/Film Quarterly |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |date=1 January 1996 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=EWinterview>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299930,00.html |title=Emma Thompson: Write for the part |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=Anne |last=Thompson |date=15 December 1995 |accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref> She found the romances to be the most difficult to "juggle,"<ref name=EWinterview/> and her draft received some critical feedback for the way it presented Willoughby and Edward. Some of the criticism, Doran later recalled, held that the story did not really begin until Willoughby's arrival, with Edward side-lined as backstory. Thompson and Doran quickly realized that "if we didn't meet Edward and do the work and take that twenty minutes to set up those people&nbsp;... then it wasn't going to work."{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=01:33:25<U+2013>01:33:49}} At the same time, Thompson wished to avoid depicting "a couple of women waiting around for men";{{sfn|Gay|2003|p=92}} gradually her screenplay focused as much on the Dashwood sisters' relationship with each other as it did with their romantic interests.<ref name=tcmfmiller/>

In possession of a screenplay draft, Doran next had to pitch the idea to various studios in order to finance the film, but found that many were wary of Thompson as the screenwriter. At the time, she was viewed as too risky, being a relatively unknown actress who had never written a film script. [[Columbia Pictures]] executive Amy Pascal supported Thompson's involvement, and agreed to sign as the producer and distributor.<ref name=ctdoran/><ref name=HuffPostNannyMcPhee/> 

====Lee's hire====
Despite not having heard of Austen prior to filming,{{sfn|Mills|2009|p=67}} Taiwanese director [[Ang Lee]] was hired as a result of his work in the 1993 family comedy film ''[[The Wedding Banquet]]'', which he co-wrote, produced, and directed. Doran felt that Lee's films, which depicted complex family relationships amidst a social comedy context, were a good fit with Austen's storylines.<ref name=tcmfmiller/> She recalled, "The idea of a foreign director was intellectually appealing even though it was very scary to have someone who didn't have English as his first language."<ref name=dailybeastlunch/> The producer sent Lee a copy of Thompson's script, to which he replied that he was "cautiously interested."<ref name=Kerr/> Fifteen directors were interviewed, but according to Doran, Lee was one of the few who recognised Austen's humour; he told them he wanted the film to "break people's hearts so badly that they'll still be recovering from it two months later."<ref name=Kerr>{{cite news |title=Sense and sensitivity |first=Sarah |last=Kerr |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MuECAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA44&dq=sense+and+sensibility+emma+thompson#v=onepage&q=sense%20and%20sensibility&f=false |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=1 April 1996 |accessdate=16 August 2011 }}</ref>

From the beginning, Doran desired that ''Sense and Sensibility'' should appeal to both a core audience of Austen aficionados as well as younger viewers attracted to [[romantic comedy]] films.{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=155}} She felt that Lee's involvement prevented the film from becoming "just some little English movie" that appealed only to local audiences instead of to the wider world.{{sfn|Higson|2004|p=46}} Lee said, "I thought they were crazy: I was brought up in Taiwan, what do I know about 19th-century England? About halfway through the script it started to make sense why they chose me. In my films I've been trying to mix social satire and family drama. I realized that all along I had been trying to do Jane Austen without knowing it. Jane Austen was my destiny. I just had to overcome the cultural barrier."<ref name=dailybeastlunch/> Because Thompson and Doran had worked on the screenplay for so long, Lee described himself at the time as a "director for hire," as he was unsure of his role and position.<ref name=HarpersBazaar/> He spent six months in England "learn[ing] how to make this movie, how to do a period film, culturally&nbsp;... and how to adapt to the major league film industry."<ref name=HarpersBazaar>{{Cite news|url=http://www.harpersbazaar.co.uk/going-out/who-what-where/in-conversation-with-ang-lee |title=In conversation with Ang Lee |work=[[Harper's Bazaar]] |first=Francine |last=Stock |date=21 January 2013 |accessdate=26 April 2013}}</ref>

In January 1995, Thompson presented a draft to Lee, Doran, co-producer Laurie Borg, and others working on the production, and spent the next two months editing the screenplay based upon their feedback.{{sfn|Thompson|1995|pp=207<U+2013>10}} Thompson would continue making revisions throughout production of the film, including altering scenes   to meet budgetary concerns, adding dialogue improvements, and flexibly changing certain aspects to better fit the actors.{{sfn|Stempel|2000|p=249}} Brandon's confession scene, for instance, initially included flashbacks and stylised imagery before Thompson decided it was "emotionally more interesting to let Brandon tell the story himself and find it difficult."{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=251}}

Thompson initially hoped that Doran would cast sisters [[Natasha Richardson|Natasha]] and [[Joely Richardson]] as Elinor and Marianne Dashwood.

The formal casting process began in February 1995,{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=210}} though some of the actors met with Thompson the previous year to help her conceptualize the script.{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=9:45<U+2013>9:53}} Lee eventually cast all but one of them: Hugh Grant (as Edward Ferrars), Robert Hardy (as Sir John Middleton), Harriet Walter (as Fanny Ferrars Dashwood), Imelda Staunton (as Charlotte Jennings Palmer), and Hugh Laurie (as Mr. Palmer).{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=210}} The sixth actor, [[Amanda Root]], was excluded, having already committed herself to star in the 1995 film ''[[Persuasion (1995 film)|Persuasion]]''.<ref name=EWinterview/> Commenting on the casting of Laurie, whom she had known for years,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/may/07/features.magazine37 |title=Going straight |work=[[The Guardian]] |first=Nicci |last=Gerrard |date=6 May 2000 |accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref> Thompson has said, "There is no one [else] on the planet who could capture Mr. Palmer's disenchantment and redemption so perfectly, and make it funny."{{sfn|Thompson|1995|pp=251<U+2013>52}}

Thompson wrote the part of Edward Ferrars with Grant in mind,{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=9:15<U+2013>9:30}} and he agreed to receive a lower salary in order to fit with the film's budget.<ref name=tcmfmiller/> Grant called her screenplay "genius," explaining "I've always been a [[philistine]] about Jane Austen herself, and I think Emma's script is miles better than the book and much more amusing."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8326853.html |title=Hugh Grant: The Englishman who went up the Hollywood mountain and came down a star |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |first=Matthew |last=Gilbert |date=7 May 1995 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}</ref> Grant's casting was met with criticism from the Jane Austen Society of North America (JASNA), who felt that he was too handsome for the part.<ref name=dailybeastlunch/> Actress Kate Winslet initially intended to audition for the role of Marianne but Lee disliked her work in the 1994 drama film ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'', causing her to audition for the lesser part of Lucy Steele.

Also appearing in the film was Alan Rickman, who portrayed Colonel Brandon.

===Costume design===
According to Austen scholar Linda Troost, the costumes used in ''Sense and Sensibility'' helped emphasise the class and status of the various characters, particularly among the Dashwoods.{{sfn|Troost|2007|p=83}} They were created by [[Jenny Beavan]] and John Bright, a team of designers best known for [[Merchant Ivory]] films who  began working together in 1984.{{sfn|Nadoolman Landis|2012}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/321309053?accountid=14756 |title=Why we should love and leave the world of Merchant Ivory |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |first=David |last=Gritten |date=25 March 2006 |accessdate=23 July 2013}} {{Subscription needed}}</ref> The two attempted to create accurate period dress,{{sfn|Troost|2007|p=83}} and featured the "fuller, classical look and colours of the [[1795<U+2013>1820 in Western fashion|late 18th century]]."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/324476672?accountid=14756 |title=Clothes make the movies: 'Fashion in Film' showcases outstanding period costumes |first=Kathaleen |last=Roberts |work=[[Albuquerque Journal]] |date=12 October 2008 |accessdate=23 July 2013}} {{Subscription needed}}</ref> They found inspiration in the works of the English artists [[Thomas Rowlandson]], John Hopper, and [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]], and also reviewed [[fashion plate]]s stored in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].<ref name=LATimesFashion/> The main costumes and hats were manufactured at Cosprop, a London-based costumer company.<ref name=LATimesFashion/>

To achieve the tightly wound curls fashionably inspired by [[Greek art]], some of the actresses wore wigs while others employed heated hair twists and slept in pin curls.

For Brandon's costumes, Beavan and Bright consulted with Thompson and Lee and decided to have him project an image of "experienced and dependable masculinity."{{sfn|Gay|2003|pp=97<U+2013>98}} Brandon is first seen in black, but later he wears sporting gear in the form of corduroy jackets and shirtsleeves. His rescue of Marianne has him transforming into the "romantic [[Byronic hero]]", sporting an unbuttoned shirt and loose cravat. In conjunction with his tragic backstory, Brandon's "flattering" costumes help his appeal to the audience.{{sfn|Gay|2003|p=98}} Beavan and Bright's work on the film earned them a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] at the [[68th Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/293206028?accountid=14756 |title=The 68th Academy Award nominations |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=14 February 1996 |accessdate=7 September 2013}} {{Subscription needed}}</ref>

The film was budgeted at $16 million,{{sfn|Mills|2009|p=68}}<ref name=AsianWeek/> the largest Ang Lee had yet received as well as the largest awarded to an Austen film that decade.{{sfn|Higson|2004|p=44}} In the wake of the success of Columbia's 1994 film ''[[Little Women (1994 film)|Little Women]]'', the American studio authorised Lee's "relatively high budget" out of an expectation that it would be another cross-over hit and appeal to multiple audiences, thus yielding high box office returns.{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=155}}{{sfn|Higson|2004|p=45}} Nevertheless, Doran considered it a "low budget film"{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=20:00<U+2013>20:20}} and many of the ideas Thompson and Lee came up with <U+2013> such as an early dramatic scene depicting Mr. Dashwood's bloody fall from a horse <U+2013> were deemed unfilmable from a cost perspective.{{sfn|Thompson|1995|pp=207<U+2013>09}}{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=1:11<U+2013>2:25}}

According to Thompson, Lee "arrived on set with the whole movie in his head".{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=01:02:00<U+2013>01:03:45}} Rather than focus on period details, he wanted his film to concentrate on telling a good story. He showed the cast a selection of films adapted from classic novels, including ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' and ''[[The Age of Innocence (1993 film)|The Age of Innocence]]'', which he believed to be "great movies; everybody worships the art work, [but] it's not what we want to do."<ref name=AsianWeek/> Lee criticised the latter film for lacking energy, in contrast to the "passionate tale" of ''Sense and Sensibility''.<ref name="AsianWeek">{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-2359450.html |title=Ang Lee on a roll: The director of The Wedding Banquet and Eat Drink |work=[[AsianWeek]] |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |first=Michael |last=Warren |date=22 September 1995 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref>

The cast and crew experienced "slight [[culture shock]]" with Lee on a number of occasions. He expected the [[assistant director]]s to be the "tough ones" and keep production on schedule, while they expected the same of him; this led to a slower schedule in the early stages of production.{{sfn|Thompson|1995|pp=220<U+2013>21}} Additionally, according to Thompson the director became "deeply hurt and confused" when she and Grant made suggestions for certain scenes, which was something that was not done in his native country.<ref name=dailybeastlunch/><ref name=tcmfmiller/> Lee thought his authority was being undermined and lost sleep,{{sfn|Mills|2009|p=70}} though this was gradually resolved as he became used to their methods.{{sfn|Thompson|1995|pp=220, 240}}{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=17:00<U+2013>17:20}} The cast "grew to trust his instincts so completely," making fewer and fewer suggestions.{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=01:02:00<U+2013>01:03:45}} Co-producer James Schamus stated that Lee also adapted by becoming more verbal and willing to express his opinion.{{sfn|Mills|2009|p=72}}

Lee became known for his "frightening" tendency to not "mince [his] words".<ref name="LADNyinyang">{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-25029678.html |title=Remaking the classics director, cast find yin, yang in Austen tale |work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |first=Amy |last=Dawes |date=13 December 1995 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}</ref> The director often had his cast do numerous takes for a scene in order to get the perfect shot,<ref name=dailybeastlunch/><ref name=Kerr/> and was not afraid to call something "boring" if he disliked it.<ref name=LADNyinyang/> Thompson later recalled the director would "always come up to you and say something unexpectedly crushing", such as asking her not to "look so old."{{sfn|Mills|2009|p=70}}{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=4:20<U+2013>4:40}} She also commented, however, that "he doesn't indulge us but is always kind when we fail."{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|pp=227<U+2013>28}} Due to Thompson's extensive acting experience, the director encouraged her to practice [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]] to "help her relax [and] make her do things simpler."<ref name=AsianWeek/> Other actors soon joined them in meditating <U+2013> according to Doran, it "was pretty interesting. There were all these pillows on the floor and these pale-looking actors were saying, 'What have we got ourselves into?' [Lee] was more focused on body language than any director I've ever seen or heard of."<ref name=AsianWeek/> He suggested Winslet read books of poetry and report back to him in order to best understand her character. He also had Thompson and Winslet live together to develop their characters' sisterly bond.<ref name=tcmfmiller/> Many of the cast took lessons in etiquette and riding [[side-saddle]].{{sfn|Thompson|1995|pp=212<U+2013>13}}

Lee found that in contrast to Chinese cinema,{{sfn|Mills|2009|p=70}} he had to dissuade many of the actors from using a "very stagy, very English tradition. Instead of just being observed like a human being and getting sympathy, they feel they have to do things, they have to carry the movie."<ref name=AsianWeek/> Grant in particular often had to be restrained from giving an "over-the-top" performance; Lee later recalled that the actor is "a show stealer. You can't stop that. I let him do, I have to say, less 'star' stuff, the Hugh Grant thing&nbsp;... and not [let] the movie serve him, which is probably what he's used to now."<ref name=AsianWeek/> For the scene in which Elinor learns Edward is unmarried, Thompson found inspiration from her reaction to her father's death.{{sfn|Thompson|1995|pp=266<U+2013>67}} Grant had been unaware that Thompson would cry through most of his speech, and the actress attempted to reassure him, "'There's no other way, and I promise you it'll work, and it will be funny as well as being touching.' And he said, 'Oh, all right,' and he was very good about it."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/05/movies/moviesspecial/05lyal.html |title=Beauty is much less than skin deep  |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Sarah |last=Lyall |date=5 November 2006 |accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref> Lee had one demand for the scene, that Thompson avoid the temptation to turn her head towards the camera.<ref name=Kerr/>

Production of ''Sense and Sensibility'' was scheduled for fifty-eight days, though this was eventually extended to sixty-five.{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=209}} Filming commenced in mid-April 1995 at a number of locations in [[Devon, England|Devon]], beginning with [[Saltram House]] (standing in for Norland Park),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2009/jun/07/sense-sensibility-saltram-walking-guide |title=The Sense and Sensibility estate, Saltram House, Devon |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=7 June 2009 |accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref>{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=149}} where Winslet and Jones shot the first scene of the production: when their characters read about Barton Cottage.{{sfn|Thompson|1995|pp=215, 217<U+2013>19}} As Saltram was a [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] property, Schamus had to sign a contract before production began, and staff with the organization remained on set to carefully monitor the filming. Production later returned to shoot several more scenes, finishing there on 29 April.{{sfn|Thompson|1995|pp=215, 217, 222, 226<U+2013>27}} The second location of filming, [[Flete House]], stood in for part of Mrs. Jennings' London estate, where Edward first sees Elinor with Lucy.{{sfn|Voigts-Virchow|2004|p=11}}{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=224}} Representing Barton Cottage was a Flete Estate stone cottage, which Thompson called "one of the most beautiful spots we've ever seen."{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=233}}

Early May saw production at the "exquisite" village church in [[Berry Pomeroy]] for the final wedding scene.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2433499/Weddings-fall-at-Sense-and-Sensibility-church-after-bells-break.html |title=Weddings fall at Sense and Sensibility church after bells break |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |first=Nick |last=Britten |date=18 July 2010 |accessdate=18 August 2011}}</ref>{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=230}} From the tenth to the twelfth of May, Marianne's first rescue sequence, depicting her encounter with Willoughby, was shot. Logistics were difficult, as the scene was set upon a hill during a rainy day.{{sfn|Thompson|1995|pp=235<U+2013>37}}  Lee shot around fifty [[take]]s, with the actors becoming soaked under rain machines; this led to Winslet eventually collapsing from [[hyperventilation]].{{sfn|Mills|2009|p=70}}{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=6:15<U+2013>6:25}} Further problems occurred midway through filming, when Winslet contracted [[phlebitis]] in her leg, developed a limp, and sprained her wrist after falling down a staircase.{{sfn|Thompson|1995|pp=261<U+2013>62}}

From May to July, production took place at a number of other National Trust estates across England. [[Trafalgar House (Wiltshire)|Trafalgar House]] and [[Wilton House]] in Wiltshire stood in for the grounds of Barton Park and the London Ballroom respectively. [[Mompesson House]], an eighteenth-century estate located in [[Salisbury]], represented Mrs. Jennings' sumptuous townhouse.

Composer [[Patrick Doyle]], who had previously worked with his friend Emma Thompson in the films ''[[Henry V (1989 film)|Henry V]]'', ''[[Much Ado About Nothing (1993 film)|Much Ado About Nothing]]'', and ''Dead Again'', was hired to produce the music for ''Sense and Sensibility''.<ref name=chicagotimessense/> Asked by the director to select existing music or compose new "gentle" melodies, Doyle wrote a score that reflected the film's events.{{sfn|Parrill|2002|p=43}}<ref name="RockyMtNews">{{Cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67774405.html |title=Score one for the movies: composers translate plot, character and setting into Oscar-nominated music |work=[[Rocky Mountain News]] |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |first=John |last=Horn |date=13 March 1996|accessdate=14 April 2013}}</ref> He explained, "You had this middle-class English [[Motif (music)|motif]], and with the music you would have occasional outbursts of emotion."<ref name="chicagotimessense">{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-03-01/entertainment/9603010027_1_sense-and-sensibility-classical-music-patrick-doyle |title=Composer's classical music makes 'Sense' in movies |first=Brad |last=Webber |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=1 March 1996 |accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> Doyle explains that the score "becomes a little more grown-up" as the story progresses to one of "maturity and an emotional catharsis."<ref name=RockyMtNews/> The score contains romantic elements<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/sense-and-sensibility-mw0000646538 |title=Sense and Sensibility <U+2013> Patrick Doyle |work=[[Allmusic]] |first=Darryl |last=Carter |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref><ref name="DenofGeekMusic">{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/17369/music-in-the-movies-patrick-doyle |title=Music in the movies: Patrick Doyle |publisher=[[Den of Geek]] |first=Glen |last=Chapman |date=21 April 2011 |accessdate=14 April 2013}}</ref> and has been described  by [[National Public Radio]] as a "restricted compass&nbsp;... of emotion" with "instruments [that] blend together in a gentle sort of way".<ref name="NPRmusic">{{Cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-28473770.html |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |title=Film scores <U+2013> The men who make the music <U+2013> Part 2 |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |first=Liane |last=Hansen |date=10 March 1996 |accessdate=14 April 2013}}</ref> They also noted that as a reflection of the story, the score is a "little wistful&nbsp;... and sentimental."<ref name=NPRmusic/>

Two songs are sung by Marianne in the film, with lyrics adapted from seventeenth-century poems.

===Editing===
Thompson and Doran discussed how much of the love stories to depict, as the male characters spend much of the novel away from the Dashwood sisters. The screenwriter had to carefully balance the amount of screentime she gave to the male leads, noting in her film production diary that such a decision would "very much lie in the editing."{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=272}} Thompson wrote "hundreds of different versions" of romantic storylines. She considered having Edward re-appear midway through the film before deciding that it would not work as "there was nothing for him to do."{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=272}} Thompson also opted to exclude the duel scene between Brandon and Willoughby, which is present in the novel, because it "only seemed to subtract from the mystery."{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=272}} She and Doran agonized about when and how to input Brandon's backstory, as they wanted to prevent viewers from becoming bored. Thompson described the process of reminding audiences of Edward and Brandon as "keeping plates spinning".{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=9:30<U+2013>9:50}}

A scene was shot of Brandon finding his ward in a poverty stricken area in London, but this was edited out.{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=01:29:10<U+2013>01:29:50}} Thompson's script included a scene of Elinor and Edward kissing, as the studio "couldn't stand the idea of these two people who we've been watching all the way through not kissing."{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=01:30:00<U+2013>01:30:35}} However, it was one of the first scenes cut during the editing process: the original version was over three hours, Lee was less interested in the story's romance, and Thompson found a kissing scene to be inappropriate. The scene was still included in marketing materials and the film trailer.{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=01:30:00<U+2013>01:30:35}}{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=141}}{{sfn|Stovel|2011}} Thompson and Doran also cut out a scene depicting a remorseful Willoughby when Marianne is sick. Doran said that despite it "being one of the great scenes in book history," they could not get it to fit into the film.{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=01:59:00<U+2013>01:59:15}}

[[Tim Squyres]] edited the film, his fourth collaboration with Ang Lee. He reflected in 2013 of his editing process, "It was the first film that I had done with Ang that was all in English, and it's Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman, and Hugh Grant <U+2014> these great, great actors. When you get footage like that, you realize that your job is really not technical. It was my job to look at something that Emma Thompson had done and say, 'Eh, that's not good, I'll use this other one instead.' And not only was I allowed to pass judgment on these tremendous actors, I was required to."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/22/showbiz/movies/oscar-nominated-editors-ew |title=Oscar-nominated editors clear up the biggest category misconception |first=Mandi |last=Bierly |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=22 February 2013 |accessdate=23 July 2013}}</ref>

==Themes and analysis==
===Changes from source material===
Scholar Louise Flavin has noted that Thompson's screenplay contains significant alterations to the characters of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood: in the novel, the former embodies "sense" and the latter, "sensibility", but Lee's film turns these two characteristics around. Audience members are meant to view self-restrained Elinor as the person in need of reform, rather than her impassioned sister.{{sfn|Flavin|2004|pp=42<U+2013>3, 46}}{{sfn|Dole|2001|pp=51<U+2013>3}} To heighten the contrast between them, Marianne and Willoughby's relationship includes an "erotic" invented scene in which the latter requests a lock of her hair <U+2013> a direct contrast with Elinor's "reserved relationship" with Edward.{{sfn|Stovel|2011}} Lee also distinguishes them through imagery <U+2013> Marianne is often seen with musical instruments, near open windows, and outside, while Elinor is pictured in door frames.{{sfn|Kohler-Ryan|Palmer|2013|p=56}} Another character altered for modern viewers is Margaret Dashwood, who conveys "the frustrations that a girl of our times might feel at the limitations facing her as a woman in the early nineteenth century."{{sfn|Parrill|2002|p=11}} Thompson uses Margaret for [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] in order to detail contemporary attitudes and customs. For instance, Elinor explains to a curious Margaret <U+2013> and by extension, the audience <U+2013> why their half-brother inherits the Dashwood estate.{{sfn|Parrill|2002|p=11}} Margaret's altered storyline, now containing an interest in fencing and geography, also allows audience members to see the "feminine" side of Edward and Brandon, as they become [[father figure|father or brother figures]] to her.{{sfn|Stovel|2011}}{{sfn|Flavin|2004|p=44}}{{sfn|Nixon|2001|pp=36<U+2013>37}} Furthermore, the film omits the characters of Lady Middleton and her children, as well as that of Ann Steele, Lucy's sister.{{sfn|Flavin|2004|pp=44<U+2013>45}}

When adapting the characters for film, Thompson found that in the novel, "Edward and Brandon are quite shadowy and absent for long periods," and that "making the male characters effective was one of the biggest problems. Willoughby is really the only male who springs out in three dimensions."{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=269}} Several major male characters in ''Sense and Sensibility'' were consequently altered significantly from the novel in an effort to appeal to contemporary audiences.{{sfn|Parrill|2002|p=7}} Grant's Edward and Rickman's Brandon are "ideal" modern males who display an obvious love of children as well as "pleasing manners", especially when contrasted with Palmer.{{sfn|Looser|1996}} Thompson's script both expanded and omitted scenes from Edward's storyline, including the deletion of an early scene in which Elinor assumes that a lock of hair found in Edward's possession is hers, when in actuality it belongs to Lucy. These alterations have been viewed as an effort to make him more realised and honourable than in the novel and increase his appeal to viewers.{{sfn|Stovel|2011}}{{sfn|Flavin|2004|p=43}} The character of Brandon also sustains alterations; to gradually show viewers why Brandon is worthy of Marianne's love, Thompson's screenplay has his storyline directly mirroring Willoughby's <U+2013> they are both similar in appearance, share a love of music and poetry, and rescue Marianne in the rain while on horseback.{{sfn|Stovel|2011}}{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=102}}{{sfn|Nixon|2001|pp=35<U+2013>36}}

===Theme of class===
Thompson viewed the novel as a story of "love and money," noting that some people needed one more than the other.{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=255}} During the writing process, executive producer [[Sydney Pollack]] stressed that the film be understandable to modern audiences, and that it be made clear why the Dashwood sisters could not just obtain a job.{{sfn|Stempel|2000|p=249}} "I'm from [[Indiana]]; if I get it, everyone gets it," he said.{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=265}} Thompson believed that Austen was just as comprehensible in a different century, "You don't think people are still concerned with marriage, money, romance, finding a partner?"<ref name=dailybeastlunch/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-25029680.html |title=Hollywood reeling over Jane Austen's novels |first=Jack |last=Kroll |work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |date=13 December 1995 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref> She was keen on emphasising the realism of the Dashwoods' predicament in her screenplay,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-12-10/entertainment/ca-12297_1_emma-thompson |title=Emma Thompson, sensibly: The levelheaded actress turns screenwriter with her adaptation of Jane Austen's 'Sense and Sensibility.' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=10 December 1995 |first=Jon |last=Stuart |accessdate=26 April 2013}}</ref> and inserted scenes to make the differences in wealth more apparent to modern audiences. Thompson made the Dashwood family richer than in the book and added elements to help contrast their early wealth with their later financial predicament; for instance, because it might have been confusing to viewers that one could be poor and still have servants, Elinor is made to address a large group of servants at Norland Park early in the film for viewers to remember when they see their few staff at Barton Cottage.{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=5:40<U+2013>6:25}} Lee also sought to emphasise social class and the limitations placed on the protagonists.{{sfn|Kohler-Ryan|Palmer|2013|p=41}} Lee conveys this in part when Willoughby publicly rejects Marianne; he returns to a more lavishly furnished room, a symbol of the wealth she has lost access to.{{sfn|Scholz|2013|p=133}}{{sfn|McRae|2013|p=35}} "Family dramas," he stated, "are all about conflict, about family obligations versus free will."{{sfn|McRae|2013|p=36}} 

The film's theme of class has attracted much scholarly attention. Carole Dole noted that class constitutes an important element in Austen's stories and is "impossible" to avoid when adapting her novels. According to Dole, Lee's film contains an "ambiguous treatment of class values" that stresses social differences but "underplays the consequences of the class distinctions so important in the novel";{{sfn|Dole|2001|pp=59<U+2013>63}} for instance, Edward's story ends upon his proposal to Elinor, with no attention paid to how they will live on such a small annual income from the [[vicarage]].{{sfn|Dole|2001|p=63}} Louise Flavin believed that Lee used the houses to represent their occupants' class and character: the Dashwood sisters' decline in eligibility are represented through the spacious rooms of Norland Park and the isolated, cramped Barton Cottage.{{sfn|Flavin|2004|p=49}} James Thompson stated that ''Sense and Sensibility'' depicts an anaesthetised "m<U+00E9>lange of disconnected picture postcard-gift-calendar-perfect scenes," in which little connection is made between "individual subjects and the land that supports them."{{sfn|Thompson|2003|pp=24<U+2013>5}} Andrew Higson argued that while ''Sense and Sensibility'' includes commentary on sex and gender, it fails to pursue issues of class. Thompson's script, he wrote, displays a "sense of impoverishment [but is] confined to the still privileged lifestyle of the disinherited Dashwoods. The broader class system is pretty much taken for granted."{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=150}} The ending visual image of flying gold coins, depicted during Marianne's wedding, has also drawn attention; Marsha McCreadie noted that it serves as a "visual wrap-up and emblem of the merger between money and marriage."{{sfn|McCreadie|2006|p=75}}

===Theme of gender===
Gender has been seen as another major theme of the film, often intersecting with class. Penny Gay observed that Elinor's early dialogue with Edward about "feel[ing] idle and useless...

In the United States, [[Sony]] and Columbia Pictures released ''Sense and Sensibility'' on a slow schedule compared to mainstream films, first premiering it on 13 December 1995.{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=155}} Believing that a limited release would position the film both as an "exclusive quality picture" and increase its chances of winning [[Academy Award]]s, Columbia dictated that its first weekend involve only seventy cinemas in the US; it opened in eleventh place in terms of box office takings and earned $721,341.{{sfn|Mills|2009|p=72}}{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=157}}<ref name="boxofficemojooverview">{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=senseandsensibility.htm |title=Sense and Sensibility (1995) |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref> To benefit from the publicity surrounding potential Academy Award candidates and increase its chance of earning nominations, the film was released within "[[Oscar season]]".{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=155}} The number of theatres showing ''Sense and Sensibility'' was slowly expanded, with particular surges when its seven Oscar nominations were announced and at the time of the [[68th Academy Awards|ceremony in late March]], until it was present in over one thousand cinemas across the US.{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=157}} By the end of its American release, ''Sense and Sensibility'' had been watched by more than eight million people,{{sfn|Higson|2004|p=65}} garnering an "impressive" total domestic gross of $43,182,776.{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=157}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&yr=1996&wknd=04&p=.htm |title=Weekend Box Office Results for January 26-28, 1996 |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref>

On the basis of Austen's reputation as a serious author, the producers were able to rely on high-brow publications to help market their film. Near the time of its US release, large spreads in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', ''[[Film Comment]]'', and other media outlets featured columns on Lee's production.{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=156}} In late December, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine declared it and ''Persuasion'' to be the best films of 1995.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983896,00.html |title=The best of 1995: Cinema |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=25 December 1995 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}</ref> Andrew Higson referred to all this media exposure as a "marketing coup" because it meant the film "was reaching one of its target audiences."{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=156}} Meanwhile, most promotional images featured the film as a "sort of [[chick flick]] in period garb."{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=156}} New Market Press published Thompson's screenplay and film diary;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-12-15/features/9512150025_1_jane-austen-society-sense-and-sensibility-sensibility-screenplay |title=Happy ending |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |first=Connie |last=Lauerman |date=15 December 1995 |accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref>{{sfn|Brownstein|2001|p=17}} in its first printing, the hard cover edition sold 28,500 copies in the US.{{sfn|Higson|2011|pp=129<U+2013>30}} British publisher [[Bloomsbury]] released a paperback edition of the novel containing film pictures, same title design, and the cast's names on the cover, whilst Signet Publishing in the US printed 250,000 copies instead of the typical 10,000 a year; actress [[Julie Christie]] read the novel in an [[audiobook]] released by Penguin Audiobooks.{{sfn|Higson|2004|pp=40<U+2013>41}}{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=129}} ''Sense and Sensibility'' increased dramatically in terms of its book sales, ultimately hitting tenth place on the [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list for paperbacks]] in February 1996.{{sfn|Thompson|2003|p=13}}

In the United Kingdom, ''Sense and Sensibility'' was released on 23 February 1996 in order to "take advantage of the hype from ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV series)|Pride and Prejudice]]''", another popular Austen adaptation recently broadcast. [[TriStar Pictures|Columbia Tristar]]'s head of UK marketing noted that "if there was any territory this film was going to work, it was in the UK."{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=157}} After receiving positive responses at previews, marketing strategies focused on selling it as both a costume drama and as a film attractive to mainstream audiences.{{sfn|Higson|2011|pp=157<U+2013>58}} Attention was also paid to marketing ''Sense and Sensibility'' internationally. Because the entire production cycle had consistently emphasised it as being "bigger" than a normal British period drama literary film, distributors avoided labelling it as "just another English period film."{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=158}} Instead, marketing materials featured quotations from populist newspapers such as the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', which compared the film to ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' (1994).{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=158}} It was watched by more than ten million viewers in Europe.{{sfn|Higson|2004|p=65}} Worldwide, the film ultimately grossed $134,582,776,<ref name=boxofficemojooverview/> a sum that reflected its commercial success.{{sfn|Mills|2009|p=72}}{{sfn|Higson|2004|p=35}} It had the largest box office gross out of the Austen adaptations of the 1990s.{{sfn|Higson|2004|p=44}}

==Reception==
''Sense and Sensibility'' received overwhelmingly positive reviews from film critics, and was included on more than a hundred top-ten of the year lists.<ref name=tcmfmiller/> Review aggregator site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] indicates that 98% of reviews were favourable, and summarises it as "an uncommonly deft, very funny Jane Austen adaptation, marked by Emma Thompson's finely tuned performance."<ref name="rottentomatoes">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1068832-sense_and_sensibility/ |title=Sense and Sensibility (1995) |publisher= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref> Writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine, [[Todd McCarthy]] observed that the film's success was assisted by its "highly skilled cast of actors," as well as its choice of Lee as director. McCarthy clarified, "Although [Lee's] previously revealed talents for dramatizing conflicting social and generational traditions will no doubt be noted, Lee's achievement here with such foreign material is simply well beyond what anyone could have expected and may well be posited as the cinematic equivalent of [[Kazuo Ishiguro]] writing ''[[The Remains of the Day]]''."<ref>{{cite news|authorlink=Todd McCarthy |first=Todd |last=McCarthy |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117904735?refcatid=31 |title=Sense and Sensibility |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=3 December 1995 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>

[[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' lauded the film for containing a sense of urgency "that keeps the pedestrian problems of an unremarkable 18th century family immediate and personal."<ref name="sfgate">{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/A-Fine-Sensibility-Emma-Thompson-adapts-Jane-3018044.php |title=A fine 'Sensibility', Emma Thompson adapts Jane Austen's classic story |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=13 December 1995 |first=Mick |last=LaSalle |authorlink=Mick LaSalle |accessdate=31 August 2012}}</ref> LaSalle concluded that the adaptation has a "right balance of irony and warmth.

In ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'', William Leith found ''Sense and Sensibility'' to be "an extremely sharp, subtle, clever, lovely looking film" that was superior to the serial ''Pride and Prejudice''. Leith especially saved praise for the cast, writing that Grant plays his role "masterfully" and Harriet Walter "conveys sour bitchiness like you never thought she could."<ref>{{cite news|first=William |last=Leith |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-110854966.html |title=Needle work |work=[[The Mail on Sunday]] |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |date=25 February 1996 |accessdate=23 July 2013}}</ref> Jarr Carr of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' thought that Lee "nail[ed] Austen's acute social observation and tangy satire," and viewed Thompson and Winslet's age discrepancy as a positive element that helped feed the dichotomy of sense and sensibility.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jay |last=Carr |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8355832.html |title=Thompson makes glorious 'Sense' |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=13 December 1995 |accessdate=23 July 2013}}</ref> The ''[[Radio Times]]''{{'}} David Parkinson was equally appreciative of Lee's direction, writing that he "avoid[s] the chocolate-box visuals that cheapen so many British costume dramas" and "brings a refreshing period realism to the tale of two sisters that allows Emma Thompson's respectful Oscar-winning script to flourish."<ref name=RadioTimesreview/>

===Awards and nominations===
{{Main|List of accolades received by Sense and Sensibility}}
Out of the 1990s Austen adaptations, ''Sense and Sensibility'' received the most recognition from Hollywood.{{sfn|Parrill|2002|p=4}} It garnered seven nominations at the 68th Academy Awards ceremony, where Thompson received the [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/oscarlegacy/1990-1999/68nominees.html |title=Nominees & winners for the 68th Academy Awards|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref> making her the only person to have won an Oscar for both her writing and acting (Thompson won the Best Actress award for ''Howards End'', in 1993).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-26/news/mn-51422_1_sarandon-win |title='Braveheart' is top film; Cage, Sarandon win |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Robert W.|last=Welkos|date=26 March 1996 |accessdate=18 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/emma-thompson-how-jane-austen-saved-me-from-going-under-1929510.html |title=Emma Thompson: How Jane Austen saved me from going under |work=[[The Independent]] |first=Andrew |last=Johnson |date=28 March 2010 |accessdate=18 August 2011}}</ref> The film also was the recipient of twelve nominations at the [[49th British Academy Film Awards]], including [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] (for Thompson), and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] (for Winslet).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards-database.html?year=1995&category=Film&award=false |title=Awards database |publisher=[[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]]|accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref> In addition, the film won the [[Golden Bear]] at the [[46th Berlin International Film Festival]],<ref name="Berlinale">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1996/03_preistr_ger_1996/03_Preistraeger_1996.html |title=Berlinale: 1996 prize winners |accessdate=1 January 2012 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> making Lee the first director to win this twice.<ref name=RadioTimesreview>{{Cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/8hfz/sense-and-sensibility |title=Sense and Sensibility |work=[[Radio Times]] |first=David |last=Parkinson |date= |accessdate=23 August 2013}}</ref>

Despite the recognition given to the film, Lee was not nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director]] or the [[Academy Award for Best Director]]. The scholar Shu-mei Shih and the journalist Clarence Page have attributed this snub to Hollywood's racism against Lee, and Chinese cinema in general.{{sfn|Shih|2007|p=57}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1996-03-12/news/1996072023_1_ang-lee-oscar-academy-award |title=Edited out of the Oscars |work=[[Baltimore Sun]] |first=Clarence |last=Page |date=12 March 1996 |accessdate=22 August 2013}}</ref> Lee sought to avoid turning his omission into a scandal and specifically asked the Taiwan state media not to make it a "national issue," explaining that he endured more pressure when forced to act as his country's representative.{{sfn|Shih|2007|p=59}}

==Legacy and influence==
''Sense and Sensibility'' was the first English-language [[Period piece|period]] adaptation of an Austen novel to appear in cinemas in over fifty years, the previous being the 1940 film ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]''.{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=125}}{{sfn|Parrill|2002|p=5}} The year 1995 saw a resurgence of popularity for Austen's works, as ''Sense and Sensibility'' and ''Pride and Prejudice'' both rocketed to critical and financial success.{{sfn|Higson|2004|p=38}}<ref>{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704594804575649041609261602.html |title=In Jane Austen 2.0, the heroines and heroes friend each other |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |first=Arden |last=Dale |first2=Mary |last2=Pilon |authorlink2=Mary Pilon |date=6 December 2010 |accessdate=18 August 2011}}</ref> The two adaptations helped draw more attention to the previously little-known 1995 television film ''Persuasion'', and led to more Austen adaptations in the following years.{{sfn|Greenfield|2001|p=1}} In 1995 and 1996, six Austen adaptations were released onto film or television.{{sfn|Parrill|2002|p=5}} The filming of these productions led to a surge in popularity at many of the landmarks and locations depicted;{{sfn|Parrill|2002|p=43}} according to the scholar Sue Parrill, they became "instant meccas for viewers."{{sfn|Parrill|2002|p=6}}

When ''Sense and Sensibility'' was released in cinemas in the US, ''[[Town & Country (magazine)|Town & Country]]'' published a six-page article entitled "Jane Austen's England", which focused on the landscape and sites shown in the film. A press book released by the studio, as well as Thompson's published screenplay and diaries, listed all the filming locations and helped to boost tourism. Saltram House for instance was carefully promoted during the film's release, and saw a 57 percent increase in attendance.{{sfn|Higson|2004|p=42}}{{sfn|Higson|2011|pp=149<U+2013>50}} In 1996, JASNA's membership increased by fifty percent.{{sfn|Greenfield|2001|p=2}} The popularity of both ''Sense and Sensibility'' and ''Pride and Prejudice'' led to the BBC and ITV releasing their Austen adaptations from the 1970s and 1980s onto DVD.{{sfn|Troost|2007|p=75}}

As the mid-1990s included adaptations of four Austen novels, little room was left to adapt the author's other remaining works. Andrew Higson argued that as a result, the adaptations left a "variety of successors" in the genres of romantic comedy and costume drama, as well as with films featuring strong female characters. Cited examples included ''[[Mrs Dalloway (film)|Mrs Dalloway]]'' (1997), ''[[Mrs. Brown]]'' (1997), ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' (1998), and ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' (2001).{{sfn|Higson|2011|pp=158<U+2013>59}} In 2008, [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]], the screenwriter of ''Pride and Prejudice'', [[Sense and Sensibility (2008 TV serial)|adapted ''Sense and Sensibility'']] for television. As a reaction to Lee overly "sentimental" film, this production featured events found in the novel but excluded from Thompson's screenplay, such as Willoughby's seduction of Eliza and his duel with Brandon. It also featured actors closer to the ages in the source material.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/jan/19/broadcasting.bbc1 |title=Davies turns up heat on Austen |work=[[The Guardian]] |first=Tara |last=Conland |date=19 January 2007 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}</ref>

''Sense and Sensibility'' has maintained its popularity into the twenty-first century. In 2004, Louise Flavin referred to the 1995 film as "the most popular of the Austen film adaptations,"{{sfn|Flavin|2004|p=42}} and in 2008, ''[[The Independent]]'' ranked it as the third best Austen adaptation of all time, opining that Lee "offered an acute outsider's insight into Austen in this compelling 1995 interpretation of the book [and] Emma Thompson delivered a charming turn as the older, wiser, Dashwood sister, Elinor."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-16902121.html |title=Senseless sensibility |work=[[The Independent]] |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |first=Liz |last=Hoggard |date=24 July 2008 |accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref> Journalist [[Zoe Williams]] credits Thompson as the person most responsible for Austen's popularity, explaining in 2007 that ''Sense and Sensibility'' "is the definitive Austen film and that's largely down to her."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6426195.stm |title=Jane Austen <U+2013> why the fuss? |publisher=[[BBC News]] |first=Denise |last=Winterman |date=9 March 2007 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref> In 2011, ''[[The Guardian]]'' film critic Paul Laity named it his favourite film of all time, partly because of its "exceptional screenplay, crisply and skilfully done."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/dec/26/favourite-film-sense-and-sensibility |title=My favourite film: Sense and Sensibility |work=[[The Guardian]] |first=Paul |last=Laity |date=25 December 2011 |accessdate=30 August 2012}}</ref>
