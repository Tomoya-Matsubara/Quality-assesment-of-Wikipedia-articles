'''Perlis''' ([[Jawi script|Jawi]] <U+06A8><U+0631><U+0644><U+064A><U+0633>) in full ''Perlis Indera Kayangan'', is the smallest state in [[Malaysia]]. It lies at the northern part of the west coast of [[Peninsular Malaysia]] and has [[Thailand]] on its northern border.

Perlis has a population of 210,000. The ethnic composition for the year 2000 in Perlis was: [[Malay]] (174,805 or 79.74%), [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] (21,058 or 9.6%), [[Malaysian Indian|Indian]] (2,658 or 1.21%) and others (20,690 or 9.45%). 

The capital of Perlis is [[Kangar]] and the royal capital is [[Arau]]. Another important town is [[Padang Besar]], at the Malaysian-Thailand border. The main port is the small village of [[Kuala Perlis]], lingking mostly to [[Langkawi Island]]. Perlis has a snake farm and Gua Kelam as tourist attractions, as well as the small yet beautiful [[Perlis State Park]].

==History==
Perlis was originally part of [[Kedah]], although it occasionally came under rule by [[Siam]] or [[Aceh]]. After the [[Siamese]] conquered Kedah in [[1821]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] felt their interests in [[Perak]] to be threatened. This resulted in the [[1826]] Burney and Low Treaties formalising relations between the two [[Malay states]] and Siam, their nominal overlord. In the [[Burney Treaty]], the exiled Kedah sultan [[Ahmad Tajuddin]] was not restored to his throne. Sultan Ahmad and his armed supporters then fought unsuccessfully for his restoration over twelve years ([[1830]]-[[1842]]). 

In [[1842]], the Sultan finally agreed to accept Siamese terms, and was restored to his throne of Kedah. However, Siam separated Perlis into a separate principality directly vassal to [[Bangkok]]. [[Syed Hussain Jamalulail]], of [[Arab]] descent and grandson of the Sultan of Kedah, became the first [[Raja]] of Perlis. His descendants still rule Perlis, but as rajas, instead of as sultans.

As with Kedah, the [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909]] forced Siam to relinquish its southern Malay vassal states to [[Great Britain]]. The British installed a [[British Resident|Resident]] in the Perlis royal capital of [[Arau]]. Perlis was returned to Siam by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] in [[World War II]] as a reward for Siam's alliance with [[Japan]], but this brief annexation ended with the Japanese surrender. After World War II, Perlis returned to British rule until it became part of the [[Malayan Union]], then [[Federation of Malaya]] in [[1957]] and lastly [[Federation of Malaysia]] in 1963.

Since 2000, the [[Raja]] or hereditary monarch has been [[Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin]]. He was the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of [[Malaysia]] from 2001 to 2006. [[Tuanku Syed Faizuddin Putra]] was the Regent of Perlis during the five-year period when Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin was Yang di-Pertuan Agong. The Chief Executive or ''Menteri Besar'' is [[Dato' Seri Shahidan Kassim]] of [[Barisan Nasional]], a former civil servant.  

In recent years, the state government's conservative [[Islamic]] policies on numerous social issues have created controversy.

==Economy==
The state economy is dominated by agriculture, with rice, sugar and fruits predominating. Forestry and fishery is also important, and the state is making efforts to attract small and medium scale manufacturing industries.
