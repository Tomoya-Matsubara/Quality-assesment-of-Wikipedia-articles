It was written by Aguilera, [[Mark Ronson]], [[Kara DioGuardi]] and Raymond Angry, and produced by Ronson and co-produced by Aguilera. The song is built around samples of "Window Raisin' Granny" (1973) by American group [[Gladys Knight and the Pips]] and "[[So Seductive]]" (2005) by American rapper [[Tony Yayo]]. Due to the inclusion of the samples, the original songs' writers obtained writing credits.

It features [[claviola]], [[horn (instrument)|horn]], [[organ (music)|organ]] and [[piano]] instrumentation. The song garnered positive reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]], many of whom cited it as a standout track on ''Back to Basics''. Critics also praised its blend of old and modern R&B influences, as well as Aguilera's vocal performance. The single was only released in Australia during the Oceanian leg of Aguilera's [[Back to Basics Tour]] (2007). "Slow Down Baby" peaked at number 21 on the [[ARIA Chart|Australian Singles Chart]], although it did not receive any promotion in that country.

I was a bit narrow-minded, I assumed nothing I was doing would be something she'd be into. I sent around some hip hop tracks I had lying about and got a call four days later saying she liked them."<ref name="Herald">{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/music/mark-ronson-hitman-to-the-stars/story-e6frf9hf-1111114294974|title=Mark Ronson, hitman to the stars |first=Cameron|last=Adams|work=[[Herald Sun]]|publisher=[[The Herald and Weekly Times]]|date=August 30, 2007|accessdate=February 19, 2012}}</ref> He stated that he had initially imagined offering "Slow Down Baby" to someone like rap duo [[M.O.P.]]<ref name="Herald"/> Ronson provided the beats and played the [[guitar]] and [[bass guitar|bass]], while Angry played the [[claviola]], [[organ (music)|organ]] and [[piano]].<ref name="liner"/> Ronson recorded Aguilera's vocals at Allido Sound in [[New York City]] and additional recording was helmed by Oscar Ramirez at [[The Record Plant]] in [[Los Angeles]], California.<ref name="liner"/> Dave "Hard Drive" Pensado later completed the [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] process at Larrabee North in [[North Hollywood]].<ref name="liner"/>
