|}'''''Kaik<U+014D>''''' (<U+6D77><U+6E9D>, "Ocean Trench") was a [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]] (ROV) built by the [[Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology]] (JAMSTEC) for exploration of the [[deep sea]]. ''Kaik<U+014D>'' was the second of only three vessels ever to reach the bottom of the [[Challenger Deep]], as of 2010. Between 1995 and 2003, this 10.6 ton unmanned [[submersible]] conducted more than 250 dives, collecting 350 biological species (including 180 different bacteria), some of which could prove to be useful in medical and industrial applications.<ref name=Kakuchi>{{cite web

''[[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|Nereus]]'', a hybrid remotely operated vehicle (HROV) of the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], is currently the only vehicle capable of exploring ocean depths significantly deeper than 7000 meters.

This depression, located at the southern end of the [[Mariana Trench]] near the [[Mariana Islands]] group, is the deepest [[surveying|surveyed]] point of the [[World Ocean]]. The ''Challenger'' scientists made the first recordings of its depth on 23 March 1875 at [http://www.19thcenturyscience.org/HMSC/HMSC-Reports/1895-Summary/htm/doc878.html station 225]. The reported depth was 4,475 [[fathom]]s (8184 meters) based on two separate soundings.

On 23 January 1960, [[Don Walsh]] and [[Jacques Piccard]] were the first men to descend to the bottom of the Challenger Deep in the [[Trieste (bathyscaphe)|''Trieste'']] [[bathyscaphe]]. Though the initial report claimed the bathyscaphe had attained a depth of 37,800 feet,<ref name=usn1960>{{cite web

At this depth, the [[water column]] above exerts a [[barometric pressure]] of {{convert|108.6|MPa|psi}}, over one thousand times the [[atmospheric pressure#Standard atmospheric pressure|standard atmospheric pressure]] at sea level. However, even at this great depth and pressure, a small [[flounder]]-like fish was seen moving away from the spotlight of the bathyscaphe. Since then, no manned vessel has ever returned to the Challenger Deep.

In March 1995, ''Kaik<U+014D>'' became the second vessel ever to reach the bottom of the [[Challenger Deep]], and the first craft to visit this location since the ''Trieste'' mission.<ref name=Kakuchi/><ref name=BBC/> The maximum depth measured on that dive was 10,911.4 meters,<ref name=BBC>{{cite news

==RV ''Kairei''==
RV ''Kairei'' is a deep sea research vessel that served as the support ship for ''Kaik<U+014D>'', and is currently the support ship for its replacement ROV, ''Kaik<U+014D>7000II''. ''Kairei'' uses the ''Kaik<U+014D>7000II'' ROV to conduct surveys and observations of [[oceanic plateau]]s, [[abyssal plain]]s, [[oceanic basin]]s, [[submarine volcano]]es, [[hydrothermal vent]]s, [[oceanic trench]]es and other underwater terrain features to a maximum depth of 7,000 meters. ''Kairei'' also conducts surveys of the structure of deep sub-bottoms with complicated geographical shapes in subduction zones using its on-board multi-channel reflection survey system.<ref name=Kairei>{{cite web

''Kaik<U+014D>'' reached a maximum depth of 10,911.4 meters at the Challenger Deep on 24 March 1995, during its initial sea trials.<ref name=BBC/><ref name=Kyo1995/><ref name=JAMSTEC01/> At that time, the craft collected video and photographs of various [[extremophile|barophilic]] [[benthos]], including [[Tube worm (body plan)|tubeworms]] and [[shrimp]].

In February 1996, ''Kaik<U+014D>'' returned to Challenger Deep, this time collecting [[sediment]] and [[microorganism]]s from the [[seabed]] at a depth of 10,898 meters. Among the novel organisms identified and collected was ''[[Moritella yayanosii]]''<ref name=Nogi1999>{{cite journal

In December 1997, ''Kaik<U+014D>'' located the wreck of ''[[Tsushima Maru]]'' on the sea floor off the coast of [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]]. ''Tsushima Maru'' was an unmarked [[Japan]]ese passenger/cargo ship that was sunk during [[World War II]] by [[USS Bowfin (SS-287)|USS ''Bowfin'']], a [[United States Navy]] [[submarine]].

In May 1998, ''Kaik<U+014D>'' returned again to Challenger Deep, this time collecting specimens of ''[[Gammaridea|Hirondellea gigas]]''. ''Hirondellea gigas'' (Birstein and Vinagradov, 1955) is a [[crustacean]] of the [[Uristidae]] [[family (biology)|family]] of [[marine (ocean)|marine]] [[Amphipoda|amphipods]].<ref>{{ITIS|ID=94312|taxon=Hirondellea|year=2010|date=24 June}}</ref>

In October 1999, ''Kaik<U+014D>'' performed a robotic mechanical operation at a depth of 2,150 meters off the coast of Okinawa near the [[Ryukyu Trench]], connecting measuring equipment with underwater cables on the sea floor. On this mission, another bacterial species, ''[[Shewanella violacea]]'', was discovered at a depth of 5,110 meters.<ref name=>{{cite journal

Certain compounds found in ''S. violacea'' may have applications in the [[cosmetics]] industry (development of products for lightening of skin tone) and also in the [[semiconductor]] industry (development of chemicals to be used in production of semiconductors).<ref name=Kakuchi/>

In late November 1999, ''Kaik<U+014D>'' located the wreckage of [[H-II|H-2]] No. 8, a [[National Space Development Agency of Japan|NASDA]] rocket ([[launch vehicle|satellite launch system]]), on the sea floor at a depth of 2,900 meters off the [[Bonin Islands|Ogasawara Islands]]. H-2 flight F8 was conducted on 15 November 1999. The rocket, which was carrying a [[Multi-Functional Transport Satellite]] (MTSAT) payload, self-destructed after experiencing an engine malfunction shortly after it was launched.

In August 2000, ''Kaik<U+014D>'' discovered hydrothermal vents and their associated [[deep sea communities]] at a depth of 2,450 meters near the [[Central Indian Ridge]]. The Central Indian Ridge is a [[divergent boundary|divergent]] [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] [[Plate_boundaries#Types_of_plate_boundaries|boundary]] between the [[African Plate]] and the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] located in the western [[Indian Ocean]].

In late May 2003, ''Kaik<U+014D>'' was lost at sea during [[2003 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon_Chan-Hom|Typhoon Chan-Hom]], when a steel secondary cable connecting it to its launcher at the surface broke off the coast of [[Shikoku|Shikoku Island]].

In May 2004, JAMSTEC resumed its research operations, using a converted ROV as its vehicle. The ROV, formerly known as ''UROV 7K'', was rechristened ''Kaik<U+014D>7000II''. The ''7000'' designation indicates that this vessel is rated for diving to a maximum depth of 7,000 meters.

==Development of ABISMO==
While the ''Kaik<U+014D>7000II'' ROV has a remarkable performance record, it is only rated to 7,000 meters and cannot reach the deepest oceanic trenches. In April 2005, JAMSTEC engineers began work on a new 11,000-meter class of ROV.<ref name=Itoh2008>{{cite book

#[[Deep-sea_exploration#Oceanographic_Instrumentation.5B13.5D|electronic instruments]] aboard RV ''KAIREI'', the support ship
#Launcher (a sampling station)
#Vehicle (a sediment probe)
#Samplers (a [[Deep-sea_exploration#Oceanographic_Instrumentation.5B13.5D|gravity corer]] or Smith Macintyre type sampler)
Except for the sampler and the smaller size of the ROV itself, the system configuration is the same as for ''Kaik<U+014D>7000II''. The launcher launches and recovers the ROV along with its sampler.

Initial sea trials of ''ABISMO'' were conducted in 2007. The craft successfully reached a planned depth of 9,760-meters, the deepest part of [[Izu-Ogasawara Trench]], where it collected core samples of sediment from the seabed.<ref name=Itoh2008/><ref name=Ishibashi2008/> Plans are underway for a mission to the Challenger Deep.
