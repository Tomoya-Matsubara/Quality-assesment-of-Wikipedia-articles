'''Falcon's Fury''' is a free-standing Sky Jump [[Drop tower (ride)|drop tower]] attraction at the [[Busch Gardens Tampa]] [[amusement park]] in [[Tampa, Florida]], United States. Manufactured by Intaride (a subsidiary of [[Intamin]]), the ride reaches a maximum height of {{Convert|335|ft|m|adj=off}} making it North America's tallest free-standing drop tower. It is also the first drop tower to use 90-degree tilting seats (facing riders straight down). Riders  experience about five seconds of [[free fall]], reaching a speed of {{Convert|60|mph|km/h}}. The ride's name was chosen to invoke a [[falcon]]'s ability to dive steeply at high speed to capture prey.<ref name=bay9nov />

The project was originally planned to start in 2012 and open to the public in 2013, but was delayed one year. Construction began in 2013, with a scheduled opening date of May 1, 2014, but the opening was delayed due to mechanical and technical issues. Falcon's Fury opened to park employees in August before a [[soft launch|soft opening]] on August 16 and an official opening on September 2. Public response to the ride has been positive, praising the height of the tower and the drop experience.

For the 2014 season, Busch Gardens Tampa expected attendance to increase by three to eight percent. However (as predicted in June 2014 by IBISWorld Research), combined attendance for the second quarter of the year increased by about 0.3 percent for [[SeaWorld Orlando]], [[SeaWorld San Diego]], [[SeaWorld San Antonio]], Busch Gardens Williamsburg and Busch Gardens Tampa. Compared to the same period in 2013, combined attendance for the first half of the year dropped by just over four percent. Busch Gardens Tampa blamed the lack of its anticipated attendance increase partially on the Falcon's Fury delays.<ref name=stockdrop /><ref>{{cite news|last1=Mayfield|first1=Dave|title=Stock in Busch Gardens' parent company takes tumble|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2014/08/stock-busch-gardens-parent-company-takes-tumble|accessdate=August 15, 2014|newspaper=The Virginian-Pilot|date=August 13, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814014608/http://hamptonroads.com/2014/08/stock-busch-gardens-parent-company-takes-tumble|archivedate=August 14, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Kosman|first1=Josh|title=SeaWorld stock sinks over <U+2018>Blackfish<U+2019> killer whale outrage|url=http://nypost.com/2014/08/13/seaworld-is-getting-that-sinking-feeling/|accessdate=August 15, 2014|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=August 13, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815130542/http://nypost.com/2014/08/13/seaworld-is-getting-that-sinking-feeling/|archivedate=August 15, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SeaWorld Entertainment (SEAS) CEO Jim Atchison on Q2 2014 Results&nbsp;<U+2013> Earnings Call Transcript|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/2419475-seaworld-entertainment-seas-ceo-jim-atchison-on-q2-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript?page=3|website=[[Seeking Alpha]]|accessdate=August 15, 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6RrLOTmyz|archivedate=August 15, 2014|page=3|date=August 13, 2014|registration=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Glasser|first1=Eric|title=Busch Gardens disputes attendance numbers|url=http://www.wtsp.com/story/news/local/hillsboroughcounty/2014/06/10/busch-gardens-disputes-attendance-numbers/10293681/|accessdate=August 26, 2014|newspaper=10 News|date=June 10, 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6RrKMOGMM|archivedate=August 16, 2014}}</ref>
