{{otherpersons|Richard Webster}}
'''Richard Webster''' (born 1950) is a British author and [[Cultural history|cultural historian]]. He is the author of five published books, dealing with subjects such as the controversy over Salman Rushdie's novel ''The Satanic Verses'', [[Sigmund Freud]] and psychoanalysis, and the investigation of sexual abuse in Britain. Webster's ''A Brief History of Blasphemy'', which tries to understand the Muslim response to ''The Satanic Verses'' and argues against unrestricted [[freedom of speech]], has been praised by Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. Webster's subsequent book ''Why Freud Was Wrong'' argues that Freud became a kind of Messiah and that psychoanalysis is a disguised continuation of the Judaeo-Christian tradition. His ''The Secret of Bryn Estyn: The Making of a Modern Witch Hunt'' (2005), was shortlisted for the [[Orwell Prize]]. Webster studied [[English literature]] at the [[University of East Anglia]] and lives in [[Oxford, England]].

==Works==
===''A Brief History of Blasphemy''===

''A Brief History of Blasphemy: Liberalism, Censorship and the Satanic Verses'' (1990) discusses the controversy over [[Salman Rushdie]]'s novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]''. It has received many favourable reviews, some suggesting that it shows that liberal support for unrestricted freedom of speech is inconsistent with other liberal values, and explains its religious origins. Tim Radford calls it "thoughtful" and "closely argued", writing that while Webster condemns the threats against Rushdie, he explains the anger and hurt ''The Satanic Verses'' caused Muslims and argues that we should not "arbitrarily defend the liberty to write or publish books which may cause distress to minorities or fuel tension between races."<ref>{{cite news | url = | title = Publish and be damned | last = Radford | first = Tim | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 1990-06-28 | accessdate = 2011-03-29}}</ref>

[[Lorna Sage]] describes ''A Brief History of Blasphemy'' as "energetic and ingenious", maintaining that Webster criticizes the liberal establishment on its own terms, and that according to him "we have internalised puritan [[iconoclasm]] to the point where we mistake it for a secular universal truth".<ref>{{cite news | url = | title = Messy freedom | last = Sage | first = Lorna | work = [[The Observer]] | date = 1990-07-22 | accessdate = 2011-03-29}}</ref> Similarly, Jim McGuigan suggests that Webster denounces liberalism in broadly liberal terms, convincingly criticizing the [[ARTICLE 19|Article 19]] pamphlet "The Crime of Blasphemy" (which advocated the abolition of Britain's blasphemy laws "without replacement") and showing that the western liberal concept of "inner conscience" upon which its secularist arguments were founded is a secular transformation of Puritanism.<ref>{{cite book |author=McGuigan, Jim |title=Cultural Populism |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1992 |pages=202<U+2013>203 |isbn=9780415062954 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

[[J. M. Coetzee]] credits Webster with showing that "Rushdie has been made to stand for an entire intellectual establishment" that compounded the outrage ''The Satanic Verses'' caused to Muslims by celebrating it.<ref>{{cite book |author=Coetzee, J. M. |title=Giving Offense: Essays on Censorship |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago and London |year=1996 |page=234 |isbn=0226111768 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Margareta Petersson places Webster among the minority of Western writers who have "tried to view the Rushdie affair from a Muslim perspective", one who views the controversy over ''The Satanic Verses'' not as a single case of confrontation between [[Islam]] and the West, but the most recent of a series of hostile encounters, which started as soon as [[Muhammad]]'s movement had grown strong. In her view Webster shows that Rushdie combines a potentially violent and offensive code with the holiest Islamic traditions, and that the language in ''The Satanic Verses'' has a charge that he was too careless with.<ref>{{cite book |author=Petersson, Margareta |title=Unending Metamorphoses: Myth, Satire, and Religion in Salman Rushdie's Novels |publisher=Lund University Press |location=Lund |year=1996 |pages=41, 204<U+2013>205 |isbn=9179663869 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Ruvani Ranashina argues that Webster shows that a civilized society should have constraints on the freedom to act in ways that have adverse effects on others, and that freedom without responsibility is dangerous, especially if offensive and damaging to a community. She sees Webster's critique of the freedom to blaspheme as providing implicit support for the group of Muslims who unsuccessfully sought to invoke British blasphemy laws that applied only to [[Christianity]] against ''The Satanic Verses'' in 1989.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ruvani Ranashina |editor=Gurnah, Abdulrazak |title=The Cambridge Companion to Salman Rushdie |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2007 |pages=49<U+2013>50 |isbn=052160995X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

[[Rowan Williams]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], in the James Callaghan Memorial lecture "Religious Hatred and Religious Offence" delivered in January 2008, called ''A Brief History of Blasphemy'', "immensely intelligent", stating that Webster shows that absolute freedom of speech is neither desirable nor possible. Williams said that Webster's book "offers some extraordinary examples of 'liberal' aggression and ignorant bigotry" during the controversy over ''The Satanic Verses'' in 1989 and 1990, and that he approved of its argument that writers and dramatists who defend the right to offend religion show a lack of imagination, in that they fail to understand the possibility that offending religion may cause real mental suffering.<ref name = Williams>{{cite web | url = http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/1561 | title = Archbishop's Lecture: Religious Hatred and Religious Offence | accessdate = 2011-03-12 }}</ref>

===''Why Freud Was Wrong''===

''Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis'' (1995) is a critique of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[psychoanalysis]]; it argues that Freud became a kind of [[Messiah]] and that psychoanalysis is a disguised continuation of the Judaeo-Christian tradition.<ref name=Storr>{{cite book |author=Storr, Anthony |title=Freud |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1996 |pages=131 |isbn=9780192822109 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> [[Anthony Storr]] calls it "controversial, brilliant, original, and learned" and "an indispensible modern critique of psychoanalysis."<ref name="Storr"/> [[Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy]] also calls it "brilliant"<ref>{{cite book |author=Gathorne-Hardy, Jonathan |title=Kinsey: A Biography |publisher=Pimlico |location=London |year=2005 |pages=92 |isbn=1844138364 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> and credits Webster with exposing the weakness of Freud's science, writing that thanks to him Freud's "disguised carrying forward of the sins of the [[Judeo-Christian|Judaeo-Christian]] tradition, especially as it affects sex, have been more comprehensively and more devastatingly exposed than ever before."<ref>{{cite book |author=Gathorne-Hardy, Jonathan |title=Kinsey: A Biography |publisher=Pimlico |location=London |year=2005 |pages=159<U+2013>160 |isbn=1844138364 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

According to Todd Dufresne, Webster argues that Freud dressed "cryptotheological" fictions in the popular positivistic language of his time, and that Freud's work is partly a legacy of German psychologist [[Gustav Fechner|Gustav Theodor Fechner]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Dufresne, Todd |title=Tales from the Freudian Crypt: The Death Drive in Text and Context |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford |year=2000 |pages=53 |isbn=0804738858 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> (Dufresne adds that Webster shows that Freud used [[Josef Breuer]]'s authority to help establish his own authority and then undermined this early attachment to Breuer to help establish his own originality, leaving "a rather unflattering portrait of one man's drive to succeed at almost any price, including friendship.")<ref>{{cite book |author=Dufresne, Todd |title=Killing Freud: Twentieth-Century Culture and the Death of Psychoanalysis |publisher=Continuum |location= |year=2005 |pages=22 |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

[[Lewis Wolpert]] writes that ''Why Freud Was Wrong'' "destroys the foundations of Freud's work and longs for a true understanding of human nature - based on Darwin", but sees it as "weak on science and psychoanalysis." He sees a "delicious unconscious irony" in the way Webster analyses Freud's development of a theory of the mind in terms of unconscious motives such as the need for love and success. He criticizes ''Why Freud Was Wrong'' for making little reference to psychoanalytic studies made since Freud's time. Wolpert considers Webster's call for a new Darwinian approach to human nature inconsistent with the [[holism]] which he also espouses.<ref>{{cite news | url = | title = Animal forces at work | last = Wolpert | first = Lewis | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 1995-09-22 | accessdate = 2011-03-29}}</ref>

[[Peter Swales (historian)|Peter Swales]] calls ''Why Freud Was Wrong'' "a relentless polemic that, if at times flawed in its simplifications, is nevertheless lethal in its total impact." Swales notes that Webster argues that Freud made medical mistakes, misdiagnosing mysterious somatic symptoms as psychogenic when they were indicative of underlying organic pathology. Swales criticizes Webster for "failing to give due consideration to alternative explanations, such as the real possibility that Freud's early patients were simply casualties of life, whose somatic symptoms he then managed to vanquish with words only because they were produces of make-believe in the first place." Swales comments that Webster's view that psychoanalysis is a disguised continuation of Judaeo-Christianity, "begins to ring hollow, for, in truth, his interpretation is merely a substitute for a closer appreciation of Freud's wide-ranging sources." Swales holds that appreciation of the history of ideas in nineteenth century [[Germany]] and [[Austria]] is crucial to understanding Freud, and criticizes Webster's frame of reference as Anglo-centric.<ref>{{cite news | url = | title = Once a cigar, always a cigar | last = Swales | first = Peter | work = [[Nature]] | date = 1995-11-02 | accessdate = 2011-05-16}}</ref>

Sarah Boxer writes that according to Webster, "all of Freud's basic concepts are tainted not only because he bent the facts but because he colored them with his secret Judeo-Christian predilections. Though Freud presented the idea of infantile sexuality as revolutionary, it was nothing more than the idea of original sin, with the infant as fallen Adam."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/08/10/reviews/970810.10boxert.html?_r=4&scp=2&sq=Frederick%20Crews&st=cse | title = Floggin Freud | last = Boxer | first = S | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1997-08-10 | accessdate = 2011-03-12}} (subscription required)</ref>

[[Raymond Tallis]] calls ''Why Freud Was Wrong'' "...a definitive critique from which it seems unlikely that Freud's reputation and that of the pseudoscience he invented will ever recover." Tallis writes that Webster builds on E. M. Thornton's "portrait of a ruthlessly ambitious man, a brutally insensitive and unscrupulous clinician, quite unrepentant about those of his terrible diagnostic blunders of which he was aware, and a supreme manipulator of friends and colleagues in his endless quest for self-promotion."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.human-nature.com/freud/tallis.html | title = Burying Freud | publisher = The Human Nature Daily Review | accessdate = 2011-03-12 }}</ref> He credits ''Why Freud Was Wrong'' with showing that the abuses of the recovered memory movement have provided a cover under which those guilty of sexual abuse can escape justice.<ref>{{cite book |author=Tallis, Raymond |title=Enemies of Hope: A Critique of Contemporary Pessimism |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Houndmills |year=1999 |pages=457 |isbn=0312224176 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

[[Elaine Showalter]] sees Webster as one of several recent critics of Freud (others include Allen Esterson, Morton Schatzman, and [[Frederick Crews]]) who have persuasively argued that he pressured his patients to produce narratives congruent with his theories. In their view, rather than being molested by their parents or fantasizing about them, Freud's patients fabricated stories along the lines of his hysterical hypotheses. Showalter criticizes Webster and other critics of Freud for offering little to replace his insights, predicting that "artists and writers will continue to cherish Freudian insights." She adds that Webster considers Freud responsible for the recovered memory movement, which he deplores and compares to "Puritan revivalism." Showalter criticizes Webster for in her view maintaining that "virtually all psychological symptoms are organic, and that every case of [[hysteria]] has been misdiagnosed".<ref>{{cite book |author=Showalter, Elaine |title=Hystories: Hysterical Epidemics and Modern Culture |publisher=Macmillan Publishers |location=London |year=1997 |pages=41, 45 |isbn=0330346709 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

[[Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson|Jeffrey Masson]] criticizes Webster for in his view wrongly blaming him for the current interest in recovered memories, and for suggesting that there is no evidence that any of Freud<U+2019>s patients were sexually abused.<ref>{{cite book |author=Masson, Jeffrey |title=The Assault on Truth: Freud<U+2019>s Suppression of the Seduction Theory |publisher=Pocket Books |location=New York |year=1998 |pages=320<U+2013>321 |isbn=0671025716 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> (In fact what Webster actually wrote was that there is no evidence that any of the ''seduction theory'' patients who came to Freud "without memories of sexual abuse" had ever suffered from such abuse.)<ref>{{cite book |author=Webster, Richard |title=Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis |publisher=The Orwell Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |pages=517 |isbn=0951592254 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Joyce Crick calls ''Why Freud Was Wrong'' "the most comprehensive negative critique" of Freud, noting that it incorporates numerous earlier critiques of Freud.<ref>{{cite book |author=Freud, Sigmund |title=The Interpretation of Dreams |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1999 |pages=xxx, xlviii |isbn=0192100491 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===''The Great Children's Home Panic''===

''The Great Children's Home Panic'' (1998) discusses [[police]] investigation of [[sexual abuse]] in Britain. [[Christian Wolmar]] writes that in Webster's view "there is a grave risk of [[injustice]] against care workers because there are financial incentives for people to make false claims", and that police have encouraged alleged victims to come forward by suggesting that they may obtain damages. Wolmar states that while the police initially referred people to lawyers, they are now reluctant to do this, as it has enabled defence lawyers to undermine the credibility of witnesses, and that many of those who make successful claims through Cica lose much of the award. According to Wolmar, while Webster sees claims to the [[Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority]] (Cica) as vulnerable to abuse because of its low standards of proof, lawyers acting on behalf of victims observe that even making claims to Cica is painful. He cites solicitor Bilhar Singh Uppal as arguing that while Webster is right to open debate, it is wrong to suggest that there has been wholesale fabrication of evidence.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/1999/mar/10/guardiansocietysupplement11 | title = Sorry State | last = Wolmar | first = Christian | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 1999-03-10 | accessdate = 2011-03-12}}</ref>

[[Damian Thompson]] writes that in Webster's view "investigations into child abuse in care homes in the early 1990s were disfigured by the zealotry associated with the Ritual Satanic Abuse affair".<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/4256136/Church-priests-children-and-the-abuse-of-truth.html | title = Church, priests, children - and the abuse of truth | last = Thompson | first = Damian | work = [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date = 2000-10-23 | accessdate = 2011-03-12}}</ref>

[[Chris Beckett]] writes that while Webster accepts that abuse occurs, he considers many convictions against former residential workerers miscarriages of justice and sees them as similar to witch-hunts. Beckett sees Webster's case against the widespread belief that the residential care system was infiltrated by [[pedophilia|paedophile]] rings as well-argued. According to Beckett, Webster argues that police procedures in North Wales dangerously reverse normal police methods, by starting with suspects and then interviewing large numbers of people to find out whether a crime was committed; this process is flawed since former residents of residential homes may have motives to make false accusations.<ref>{{cite news | url = | title = The Witch-Hunt Metaphor (And Accusations against Residential Care Workers) | last = Beckett | first = Chris | work = [[British Journal of Social Work]] | date = 2002 | accessdate = 2011-03-29}}</ref>

===''Freud''===

''Freud'' (2003) is a short critical discussion of Freud written for ''The Great Philosophers'' series edited by [[Ray Monk]] and Frederic Raphael. [[Steven Poole]] calls ''Freud'' "rather an entertaining demolition job", noting that it discusses [[Anna O.]]'s hysteria, Freud's abandoned seduction theory, reconstructed memories, the [[Oedipus complex]], and the influence of [[Wilhelm Fliess]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2003/may/03/featuresreviews.guardianreview7 | title = New world order, old danger | last = Poole | first = Steven | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 2003-05-03 | accessdate = 2011-03-12}}</ref>

===''The Secret of Bryn Estyn''===

''The Secret of Bryn Estyn: The Making of a Modern Witch Hunt'' (2005) discusses the case of [[Bryn Estyn]], a care home for adolescent boys which, in the 1990s, became the focus of press revelations and a police investigation for [[child abuse]] that spread across a number of residential homes in [[North Wales]]. It received praise from British journalists. [[Peter Wilby]] calls ''The Secret of Bryn Estyn'' "exhaustively researched", noting that while it was shortlisted for the [[Orwell Prize]], it went largely unnoticed by the British press. Wilby writes that Webster compares modern scandals of mass abuse to the [[witch-hunt]]s of the [[Middle Ages]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/dec/01/jersey-children-home-haut-garenne | title = Murder, they wrote | last = Wilby | first = Peter | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 2008-12-01 | accessdate = 2011-03-12}}</ref> [[Catherine Bennett (journalist)|Catherine Bennett]] credits Webster with exposing "the hysteria and false accusations generated by the Bryn Estyn children's home investigations", and writes that in his view the uncritical press reports about the issue demonstrate "the insatiable human appetite for narratives of evil".<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/nov/16/child-protection-babyp-catherine-bennett | title = Baby P exposes our need to believe in the perfect parent | last = Bennett | first = Catherine | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 2008-11-16 | accessdate = 2011-03-12}}</ref>

In 2005, [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]] reported that, following legal advice, [[Wrexham County Borough Council|Wrexham council]] decided to refuse permission for FACT North Wales, a support group for carers and teachers, to hold its conference 'False Allegations - Truthful Answers' at the Erlas Centre, one of its venues, after it learned the purpose of the event. Webster, who was to have been a key speaker at the conference, had been going to discuss ''The Secret of Bryn Estyn''. Wrexham councillor Malcolm King was quoted saying that he was "very pleased" that the council had prevented something that "would have been very hurtful to many people who have already been hurt enough". Webster stated in reply that he was "flabbergasted" by the council's action, and that Mr King "entirely missed the point", since the evidence showed that there never was a [[Pedophilia|paedophile]] ring based at Bryn Estyn and that dozens of staff had been wrongly accused.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/north_east/4552643.stm | publisher = BBC News | title = Abuse group banned from meeting | accessdate = 2011-03-12 }}</ref>

[[James Fenton]] writes that Webster, in an "interesting" article published on his web site, suggests that former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] offered a generous tribute to the deceased scientist [[David Kelly (weapons expert)|David Kelly]] because he was worried that Kelly's widow might accuse him of being responsible for her husband's death, thereby endangering his political career.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2003/oct/23/blair-in-trouble/ | title = Blair in Trouble | last = Fenton | first = James | work = [[The New York Review of Books]] | date = 2003-10-23 | accessdate = 2011-03-12}}</ref>

Webster is currently working on "a study of the role played by [[disgust]] in [[human evolution]] and human [[culture]]".<ref name="Webster's home page" />

==Personal life==

Born in 1950, Webster studied English literature at the University of East Anglia; he has also taught there. In 1985 Webster and his wife started The Orwell Bookshop in Southwold.<ref name="Blasphemy" />

Webster describes himself as "an [[atheism|atheist]] who was brought up as a [[Methodism|Methodist]]."<ref name="Blasphemy" />

Webster writes, "One of the questions I am frequently asked is why I have taken such an interest in the problem of false allegations. There are many answers to this question, but one of them is relatively simple...when I was an undergraduate reading English literature at the University of East Anglia, I stumbled upon a book by the historian [[Norman Cohn]], ''[[The Pursuit of the Millennium]]''...The extraordinary range and power of Cohn's book lead me to read his other work - his book about conspiracy theories and modern anti-semitism, ''Warrant for Genocide'', and, when it appeared in 1975, ''Europe's Inner Demons'', his study of the great European witch-hunt of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. All three books seek to establish the role played in history by collective fantasies and all three are concerned with 'the urge to purify the world through the annihilation of some category of human beings imagined as agents of corruption and incarnations of evil.'...The Paladin paperback edition of ''Europe's Inner Demons'', which appeared in 1976, bore on its cover these words of Anthony Storr: 'This is a book of real stature which I hope will have wide impact. Only if we begin to understand the horrifying recesses of the human imagination can we prevent the recurrence of those dreadful, irrational persecutions which have so disfigured human history.' Without my fully realising it at the time, those words influenced me deeply and I have since taken it for granted that the principle reason why we should study the witch-hunts of the past is to enable us the better to recognise and oppose the witch-hunts of the present and the future."<ref>{{cite book |author=Webster, Richard |title=The Secret of Bryn Estyn: The Making of a Modern Witch Hunt |publisher=The Orwell Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |pages=xv-xvi |isbn=0951592246 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Webster was one of two main speakers at a conference on the future of [[psychiatry]] arranged by senior professor of psychiatry Einar Kringlen and held in 1997 in Oslo, [[Norway]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=spr.021.0092a | title = Comments on Richard Webster's book: Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis | publisher = PEP Web | accessdate = 2011-05-11}}</ref> 

With writer [[Bob Woffinden]], Webster helped find lawyers for Dawn Reed and Christopher Lillie, former [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] nurses who were falsely accused of sexually abusing children in their care. Reed and Lillie, who were first accused of child abuse in 1993 and only found not guilty in 2002, say that they would probably be dead, through suicide or murder, without Webster and Woffinden's intervention. Reed told ''[[The Observer]]'' that, "After all that had happened, to find people who wanted to help us just out of the goodness of their hearts was amazing".<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2002/aug/04/childprotection | title = 'We were terrified - we could have been killed' | last = Rose | first = David | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 2003-10-23 | accessdate = 2011-08-04}}</ref>
