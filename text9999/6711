'''Lobster Newberg''' is an [[Cuisine of the United States|American]] [[seafood]] dish made from [[lobster]], [[butter]], [[cream]], [[cognac (drink)|cognac]], [[sherry]],<ref>These ingredients have largely replaced the original [[Madeira wine|Madeira]], which is too sweet for the modern taste for "dryness."</ref> [[Egg (food)|egg]]s and [[Cayenne pepper]]. The dish was invented by Ben Wenberg, a sea captain in the fruit trade. He demonstrated the dish at [[Delmonico's Restaurant|Delmonico<U+2019>s Restaurant]] in [[New York City]] to the manager, [[Delmonico's Restaurant|Charles Delmonico]], in 1876. After refinements by the [[chef]], [[Charles Ranhofer]], the creation was added to the restaurant<U+2019>s [[menu]] as ''Lobster <U+00E1> la Wenberg'' and it soon became very popular. 

An argument between Wenberg and Charles Delmonico caused the dish to be removed from the menu. To satisfy patrons<U+2019> continued requests for it, the name was rendered in [[anagram]] ''Lobster <U+00E1> la Newberg'' or ''Lobster Newberg''. It is still quite popular and is found in [[French cuisine|French cookbooks]], where it is sometimes referred to as <U+201C>Homard saut<U+00E9> <U+00E0> la cr<U+00E8>me.<U+201D> When Ranhofer<U+2019>s printed recipe first appeared in 1894, the lobsters were boiled fully twenty-five minutes, then fried in clarified butter, then simmered in cream while it reduced by half, then brought again to the boil after the addition of the Madeira.
