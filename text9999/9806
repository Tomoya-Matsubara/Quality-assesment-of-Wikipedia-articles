"'''New Guys'''" is the first episode of the [[The Office (U.S. season 9)|ninth season]] of the American [[television comedy|comedy]] television series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', and the show's 177th episode overall. It originally aired on the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC) on September&nbsp;20, 2012. The episode was written and directed by series creator [[Greg Daniels]]; this is his first writing credit for the series since the [[The Office (U.S. season 7)|seventh season]] episode "[[Goodbye, Michael]]", and his first directing credit since "[[PDA (The Office)|PDA]]".

The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In this episode, two new employees ([[Clark Duke]] and [[Jake Lacy]]) are hired by the Scranton branch and cause trouble for [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) and [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]). [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) returns from manager training, hoping for revenge on [[Nellie Bertram]] ([[Catherine Tate]]). [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar Martinez]] ([[Oscar Nunez]]) considers adopting [[Angela Martin|Angela Lipton]]'s ([[Angela Kinsey]]) cat. [[Kevin Malone]] ([[Brian Baumgartner]]) tries to save a turtle.

"New Guys" was the inception of several story arcs and saw the departure of [[Mindy Kaling]] as [[Kelly Kapoor]], due to her involvement in her own sitcom ''[[The Mindy Project]]''. "New Guys" received largely positive pre-release reviews from television critics. Post-release reviews were more mixed to positive; while many felt that the episode was a distinct step in the right direction for the show, others took issues with some of the comedic aspects of the episode. "New Guys" was viewed by 4.28 million viewers and received a 2.1 rating among adults between the age of 18 and 49, making it the show's lowest-rated season premiere. The episode ranked second in its timeslot and was also the highest-rated NBC series of the night.

==Plot==

Over the summer, [[Kevin Malone|Kevin]] ([[Brian Baumgartner]]) tried to save a turtle that he ran over, but only ends up killing it. [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) moved to Ohio with her fianc<U+00E9> Ravi and [[Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) also moved to Ohio for "unrelated reasons." [[Dwight Schrute|Dwight]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) learned that he is not the biological father of [[Angela Martin|Angela]]'s ([[Angela Kinsey]]) baby.

While talking to the camera, [[Jim Halpert|Jim]] ([[John Krasinski]]) and [[Pam Halpert|Pam]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) reveal that Jim was offered an [[entrepreneur]]ial sports job by his old college friend. Jim tells the camera that he turned it down, because it would not be good for his family. Pam and Jim begin to take off their microphones and Pam makes a remark, noting that, after nine years, the cameramen should have enough footage for a documentary. One of the cameramen then addresses the two, saying that they are more interested in the developments of the office workers themselves, especially Jim and Pam, rather than the office now. Jim looks pensive when Pam tells the cameramen that, with work and kids, nothing interesting will happen to the Halperts in a long time.

Two new employees, Clark ([[Clark Duke]]) and Pete ([[Jake Lacy]]), who are quickly dubbed "Dwight, Jr." and "The New Jim," are hired by the Scranton branch and cause trouble for Jim and Dwight. At first, Dwight is happy to have a protege, but soon begins to fear that Clark is after his job. Jim, on the other hand, does not feel that Pete is anything like him. However, after hearing Pete discuss his future plans, Jim realizes that he used to have Pete's ambition but has become stuck at the same job for over nine years.  Meanwhile, Angela puts one of her cats, Comstock, up for adoption as her baby is allergic to it. [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar]] ([[Oscar Nunez]]) initially refuses to adopt Comstock despite Angela's pleas, but agrees to adopt it after learning that it is her husband Robert's ([[Jack Coleman]]) favorite cat. It is implied that Robert and Oscar are having an affair, as Robert told Angela he was having a business dinner on the night he actually had plans with Oscar.

[[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) returns from [[Outward Bound]] manager training<U+2014>where he became more "decisive and confident"<U+2014>hoping for revenge on [[Nellie Bertram|Nellie]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) for commandeering his job during [[The Office (U.S. season 8)|the previous spring]]. To do this, Andy sets up a slackline in the parking lot and makes the employees walk across it, humiliating Nellie as she insists on walking in her heels and fails to keep her balance. After Clark proves that he is talented at balancing, Dwight attempts to one-up him, but ends up failing repeatedly and hurting himself. Eventually, Dwight tries to prove his superiority by riding a bicycle across a tight-rope suspended between the roof and a telephone pole, but the photocopier he is using as a counterweight is not heavy enough and he ends up losing his balance and hanging from the bicycle above the parking lot. Much to his embarrassment, he has to be rescued by a team of firefighters, while [[Creed Bratton (The Office)|Creed]] ([[Creed Bratton]]) mistakenly believes the incident to be a circus act. While everyone is outside crowding around Dwight, Jim calls up his old college friend and tells him that he wants to be involved in the new business deal, even though he did not have Pam's approval.

Erik Adams of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' compared Dwight and Clark's relationship to that of the mythical characters of King [[Laius]] and [[Oedipus]], respectively.<ref name=av/> The story, which was later turned into a popular play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' by Greak writer [[Sophocles]], tells of how Laius hears of a prophecy that his son will kill him. Fearing the prophecy, Laius abandons his son, Oedipus', who is raised in the city of Thebes. Oedipus later crosses paths with Laius and gets into a fight and, not knowing that Laius is his father, kills him.<ref>Sophocles, ''passim''</ref> Adams, thus, states that the "break-room conversation" Dwight and Clark share starts to make Dwight paranoid and fear that Clark is after his job.<ref name=av/>

Many reviewers noted that the episode made references to previous episodes of the series. The ending, featuring Dwight trying to bicycle on the roof, was positively compared to the [[The Office (U.S. season 3)|third season]] episode "[[Safety Training]]".<ref name=av/><ref>{{cite web|last=Dougherty|first=Matthew|title='The Office' Season Premiere Review: A Return to Form?|url=http://thecelebritycafe.com/reviews/2012/09/office-season-premiere-review-return-form|publisher=The Celebrity Cafe|accessdate=September 21, 2012|date=September 21, 2012}}</ref> Adams wrote that many of the scenes "take characters to corners of the office tied to memories of episode<U+2019>s {{sic}} past", such as Oscar's phone call, which takes place in the stairwell where Dwight pumped himself up for his work review in the [[The Office (U.S. season 2)|second season]] episode "[[Performance Review]]", and Pam climbing up the rooftop access ladder, which is reminiscent of Pam and Jim's first "date" in the second season episode "The Client".<ref name=av/>

Many reviews were complimentary towards the interaction Pam and Jim had with the cameramen. Silverberg called it "a nice surprise".<ref name=silver/> Tucker called the sequence one of the "biggest reveals" in the episode.<ref name=ew>{{cite web|last=Tucker|first=Ken|title='The Office' Season Premiere Review: Now That's the Way to Start a Season|url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2012/09/20/the-office-season-9-premiere/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time, Inc.|Time Inc]]|accessdate=September 21, 2012|date=September 20, 2012}}</ref> Sepinwall, despite being critical of the episode's humor, found the sub-plot "interesting". He called it "a character arc I've been waiting for the show to remember to do for years now, and the scenes here were promising (if not incredibly funny)".<ref name=alan/>
