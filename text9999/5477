{{Greek myth (sea)}}

'''Ceto''' (also '''Keto''', from {{lang-el|<U+039A><U+1FC6><U+03C4><U+03CE>, "[[sea monster]]"}}) is a [[Protogenoi|primordial]] [[Greek sea gods|sea goddess]] in [[Greek mythology]], the daughter of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and [[Pontus (mythology)|Pontus]]. Ceto was also variously called '''Krataiis''' ("mighty") and '''Trienos''' ("three-times"), and was occasionally conflated by scholars with the goddess [[Hecate]] (for whom Trienos and Krataiis are also epithets).  As a mythological figure, she is most notable for bearing by her husband [[Phorcys]] a host of monstrous children, collectively known as the [[Phorcydes]].  The [[asteroid]] [[65489 Ceto]] was named after her, and its satellite after her husband. 

This goddess should not be confused with the minor [[Oceanid]] also named [[Ceto (Oceanid)|Ceto]] -- who appears in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' as a separate character from Ceto the daughter of Pontus and Gaia<U+2014>or with various mythological beings referred to as ''[[Cetus (mythology)|ketos]]'' (plural ''ketea''); this is a general term for "sea monster" in Ancient Greek.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkh%3Dtos "<U+03BA><U+1FC6><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C2>"] in Liddell, Henry and Robert Scott. 1996.

==Ceto in ancient texts==
[[File:KetoAltar.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The goddess Ceto aiding her father Pontus in the mythological war known as the [[Gigantomachy]] - ca. 166-156 BC - ''Gigantomachy Frieze, [[Pergamon Altar|Pergamon Altar of Zeus]]'']][[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' lists the children of Phorcys and Ceto as [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], [[Gorgons|The Gorgons]] ([[Euryale]], [[Stheno]], and the famous [[Medusa (mythology)|Medusa]]), [[Graeae|The Graeae]] ([[Deino]], [[Enyo]], and [[Pemphredo]]), and [[Ladon]], also called the Drakon Hesperios ("Hesperian Dragon", or dragon of the Hesperides).  These children tend to be consistent across sources, though Ladon is sometimes cited as a child of Echidna by [[Typhon]] and therefore Phorcys and Ceto's grandson.

[[Apollodorus]] and [[Homer]] refer to [[Scylla]] as the daughter of Krataiis, with Apollodorus specifying that she is also Phorcys's daughter.  [[Apollodorus]] also refers to Scylla as the daughter of Trienos, implying that Krataiis and Trienos are the same entity.  [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius]] cites Scylla as the daughter of Phorcys and a conflated [[Hecate|Krataiis-Hekate]].  [[Stesichorus]] refers to Scylla as a daughter of Phorcys and [[Lamia (mythology)|Lamia]] (potentially translated as "the shark" and referring to Ceto rather than to the mythological Libyan Queen).

The Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius cites Phorcys and Ceto as the parents of [[Hesperides|The Hesperides]], but this assertion is not repeated in other ancient sources.

Homer refers to [[Thoosa]], the mother of [[Polyphemus]], as a daughter of Phorcys, but does not indicate whether Ceto is her mother.

Pliny mentions worship of "storied Ceto" at [[Joppa]] (now [[Jaffa]]), in a single reference, immediately after his mention of [[Andromeda]], whom [[Perseus]] rescued from a sea-monster. S. Safrai and M. Stern suggest in ''The Jewish people in the first century. Historical geography, political history, social, cultural and religious life and institutions'' the possibility that someone at Joppa established a cult of the monster under the name Ceto.  As an alternative explanation, they posit that Pliny or his source misread the name as ''cetus'' - or the Syrian goddess [[Derceto]].<ref>''Colitur illic fabulosa Ceto''.  Pliny, Book 5, chapter 14, <U+00A7>69; this same paragraph will be referred to as v.14, v.69, V.xiv.69 - and v.13 (one of the chapter divisions is missing in some MSS). For Ceto as a transferred name, see Rackham's Loeb translation; for emendations, see ''The Jewish people in the first century. Historical geography, political history, social, cultural and religious life and institutions.'' Ed. by S. Safrai and M. Stern in co-operation with D. Flusser and W. C. van Unnik, Vol II, p. 1081, and Oldfather's translation of Pliny (Derceto).</ref>
