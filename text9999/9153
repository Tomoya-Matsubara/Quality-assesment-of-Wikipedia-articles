'''Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering (SVCE) ''' (to be conferred University status) is a [[private]] [[college]] located in ''Pennalur'' , [[Sriperumbudur]] near [[Chennai]].
SVCE was founded by the Sri Venkateswara Educational and Health Trust (SVEHT) in the year 1985. The Trust was founded on August 1, 1984 at the behest of Sri [[Jayendra Saraswathi]] Swamigal.The college, established in the city of [[Chennai]] by the [[SPIC]] group, a prominent petro-chemical corporation in India, is said to be among the top three colleges<ref>{{cite encyclopedia

== History ==
[[Image:Svceoldcamp.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Inauguration of the old college campus;April 8, 1985]]
===Initial Years===
In November 1984 the college was granted permission to conduct Engineering courses in the disciplines of [[Mechanical Engineering]], [[Electronics and Communication Engineering]] and [[Computer Science Engineering]], awarded by the [[University of Madras]].

The college complex at Nazarathpet (near [[Poonamallee]]) was inaugurated on April 8, 1985 by Sri [http://www.tnrajbhavan.gov.in/images/PastGov/SLKhurana.JPG S.L Khurana], former [[Governor]] of [[Tamil Nadu]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia

===Expansion===
[[Image:SVCE entrance close up.jpg|thumb|left|The entrance to the college]]
In 1991, the college shifted into its new campus at [[Pennalur]], near the town of [[Sriperumbudur]]. The buildings were designed by the architect P.T.Krishnan. The ''[[grihapravesam]]'' function of the new Campus was performed on July 25,1991 in the presence of  Sri [[Jayendra Saraswathi]] Swamigal,and was inaugurated by Shri R.Venketaraman(Former President of [[India]]) on January 5,1992,and received approval from the [[All India Council for Technical Education]] the same year.Courses in [[Electrical & Electronics Engineering]] and [[Chemical Engineering]] Courses were started in 1994.[[Sri_Venkateswara_College_of_Engineering#cite_note-2|<sup>[3]</sup>]]

The college celebrated its decennial on 16-3-1995 in the presence of former Minister of State for Commerce and present [[Finance minister]] of the Government of India Shri [[P. Chidambaram]].In 1996 the college initiated a course in [[Information Technology]],and was the ''first college in the country'' to do so.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia

===Challenges and controversies===
[[Image:Svceadmin.JPG|thumb|175px|SVCE's main block,which houses the library & administration block.]]
SVCE went under the government scanner with the Directorate of Technical Education(DOTE) intensifying its drive against the collection of capitation fee and tuition fee in excess of that prescribed.

It was found that a donation of {{INRConvert|500000}} was allegedly paid by a student through a demand draft to the Spic Educational Trust. DOTE officials are said to have found that the trust was an unregistered entity and traced its bank account, which was supposedly linked to the college. DOTE officials claimed they would initiate legal action against the college and also ask the [[AICTE]] to cancel its recognition in the forthcoming academic year.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia

The crackdown by the Directorate of Technical Education officials on the college did not however,stop the filling up of its seats under the single window system in the first few days of the 2007 DOTE counselling.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia
