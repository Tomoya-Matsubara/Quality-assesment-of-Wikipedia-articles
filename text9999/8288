{{Campaignbox French Revolutionary Wars: Anglo-Spanish War (1796)}}

The '''Action of 15 July 1798''' was a minor naval battle of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], fought off the Spanish Mediterranean coast by the [[Royal Navy]] [[ship of the line]] [[HMS Lion (1777)|HMS ''Lion'']] under Captain [[Manley Dixon]] and a squadron of four [[Spanish Navy]] [[frigates]] under Commodore Don Felix O'Neil. ''Lion'' was one of several ships sent into the Western Mediterranean by Vice-Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Earl St Vincent]], commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet based at the [[Tagus]] in Portugal during the late spring of 1798. The Spanish squadron was a raiding force that had sailed from [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] in Murcia seven days earlier, and was intercepted while returning to its base after an unsuccessful cruise. Although together the Spanish vessels outweighed the British ship, individually they were weaker and Commodore O'Neil failed to ensure that his manoeuveres were co-ordinated. As a result one of the frigates, [[Spanish frigate Santa Dorotea|''Santa Dorotea'']], fell out of the [[line of battle]] and was attacked by ''Lion''. 

Despite ineffectual long-range gunfire towards the British ship by the remainder of the Spanish squadron, the isolated ''Santa Dorotea'' was rapidly forced to surrender, O'Neil eventually turning the other three frigates back towards Cartagena. Unopposed, Dixon was able to consolidate his prize and send it to St Vincent's fleet off [[Cadiz]], where it was subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy. ''Lion'' remained in the Mediterranean during the year, later participating in the blockades of [[Malta]] and [[Alexandria]]. The Spanish, their seaports carefully guarded by Royal Navy squadrons, launched no further expeditions into the Mediterranean during the year.

==Background==
At the start of 1798, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] was entirely under the control of the [[French Navy]] and their allies, including Spain, which had switched sides in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in late 1796 at the [[Second Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]].<ref name="JHR140">Rose, p. 140</ref> Denied access to deep water ports and adequate supplies, the Royal Navy fleet deployed in the Mediterranean under Vice-Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Sir John Jervis]] was forced to withdraw to the nearest friendly fleet anchorage, at the mouth of the [[Tagus River]] in Portugal.<ref name="SM224">Maffeo, p. 224</ref> Although forced to retreat, Jervis' force was not defeated and on 14 February 1797 he achieved a victory over the [[Spanish Navy]] at the [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|Battle of Cape St Vincent]], capturing four Spanish [[ships of the line]].<ref name="WLC318">Clowes, p. 318</ref> A [[blockade]] of the Spanish Atlantic ports was instituted, especially [[Cadiz]], the large southern fleet anchorage, and the Spanish did not again attempt to break out during the remainder of the year.<ref name="WJ195"/>

Early in 1798, rumours reached Jervis, recently ennobled as [[Earl St Vincent]], of a build up of French forces around the Mediterranean seaport of [[Toulon]] under General [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. Similar rumours had reached the [[Admiralty]] in London, and St Vincent therefore sent Rear-Admiral [[Horatio Nelson|Sir Horatio Nelson]] and three ships of the line to observe French activity.<ref name="WLC351">Clowes, p. 351</ref> Nelson arrived too late however, and the French fleet had already sailed, carrying over 30,000 men into the Eastern Mediterranean. Nelson, joined by a fleet of ten ships sent by St Vincent under Captain [[Thomas Troubridge]], [[Mediterranean campaign of 1798|pursued the French]], but failed to learn of their destination before the French fleet captured [[Malta]]. Ten days later, Bonaparte sailed for [[Alexandria]] for the second stage of his operation and Nelson's fleet unwittingly passed his during the night, the British beating the French to Egypt but sailing off again before Bonaparte arrived.<ref name="RLA15">Adkins, p. 15</ref>

While Nelson was crossing the Mediterranean, St Vincent was taking advantage of the absence of enemy forces in the Western Mediterranean to deploy newly arrived warships to the region.<ref name="RG54">Gardiner, p. 54</ref> One of these vessels was the 64-gun ship of the line [[HMS Lion (1777)|HMS ''Lion'']], under the command of Captain [[Manley Dixon]], who had been sent to St Vincent's fleet early in the year as a replacement for one of Troubridge's ships. Initially ordered to patrol the Spanish Mediterranean coast, ''Lion'' was cruising {{convert|97|mi|km}} southeast of [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], a port in the Spanish [[Region of Murcia]] at 09:00 on 15 July when four sails were spotted to the southeast.<ref name="WJ225">James, p. 225</ref>

==Battle==
The four sails spotted by ''Lion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s lookout were a squadron of Spanish [[frigates]] that had departed Cartagena on 8 July for a brief and unsuccessful commerce raiding operation in the Western Mediterranean.<ref name="LG1"/> Each ship carried 34-guns and a weight of shot of approximately {{convert|180|lb|kg}} to ''Lion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s {{convert|678|lb|kg}}.<ref name="WLC512"/> On sighting ''Lion'', the Spanish ships formed a [[battle line]], with Commodore [[Felix O'Neil]]'s flagship [[Spanish frigate Pomona|''Pomona'']] under Captain Don Francis Villamil in the lead followed by [[Spanish frigate Proserpine|''Proserpine'']] under Captain Don Quaj. Bial, [[Spanish frigate Santa Dorotea|''Santa Dorotea'']] under Captain Don Manuel Gerraro and [[Spanish frigate Santa Cazilda|''Santa Cazilda'']] under Captain Don Deam. Errara.<ref name="LG1"/> Seeking to engage the strangers, Dixon bore up, halting his movement to ensure he held the weather gage. This would enable him to manoeuvre with the wind and attack the Spanish at the time of his choosing. Seizing the advantage, Dixon then bore down on the frigate squadron, which prepared to meet the attack.<ref name="WLC511">Clowes, p. 511</ref>

One of the frigates, ''Santa Dorotea'', had lost a topmast sometime earlier and as result was slower than the rest of the squadron. Falling behind the others, Gerraro soon found that his ship was in danger of being isolated by ''Lion'', as Dixon steered for the rapidly opening gap between the Spanish ships. Recognising the danger, O'Neil ordered the front three frigates to turn around and sail to the defence of ''Santa Dorotea'', passing close by ''Lion'' and opening a heavy fire at 11:15.<ref name="LG1">{{LondonGazette|issue=15061|startpage=879|date=15 September 1798|accessdate=17 November 2009}}</ref> ''Lion'' replied, and the Spanish frigates did not immediately turn back for a second pass, continuing ahead as Dixon closed with the straggling ''Santa Dorotea''.<ref name="RG54">Gardiner, p. 54</ref> In an effort to deter the ship of the line, Gerraro opened fire on ''Lion'' with his stern chasers, cannon situated in the frigate's stern, which caused considerable damage to Dixon's rigging.<ref name="WJ226"/> As ''Lion'' began to close the distance, O'Neil's ships returned, but the frigates passed ''Lion'' at extreme distance, their broadsides having no effect and again coming under fire themselves.<ref name="RG54"/>

Eventually, Dixon succeeded in bringing his ship alongside the Spanish frigate and opened a heavy fire, to which Gerraro replied with his own broadside. The larger and more powerful British ship was able to rapidly inflict severe damage to the ''Santa Dorotea'', and within minutes the mizenmast had fallen and the mainmast and rudder were severely battered.<ref name="WJ226">James, p. 226</ref> As ''Santa Dorotea'' veered off course, O'Neil passed ''Lion'' for a third time, at an even greater distance than before, and once again his broadsides failed to have an effect and again he came under fire from the British vessel. His last attempt to save ''Santa Dorotea'' defeated, O'Neil turned away and his ships raised all sail in the direction of Cartagena at 13:10.<ref name="WLC512">Clowes, p. 512</ref> Gerraro, his isolated ship trapped by ''Lion'', which was slowly turning back towards the drifting frigate, raised the [[Union Flag]] upside down as a sign of surrender.<ref name="LG1"/>

==Aftermath==
''Santa Dorotea'' had suffered severe damage during the brief engagement, and had at least 20 men killed and 32 wounded from a crew of 371. By contrast, ''Lion'' had lost just two men wounded in the exchange: a seaman lost a leg and a [[midshipman]] was shot in the shoulder.<ref name="LG2">{{LondonGazette|issue=15061|startpage=880|date=15 September 1798|accessdate=17 November 2009}}</ref> Although ''Lion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s rigging had been badly torn, there was no structural damage at all. Securing his prize, Dixon spent the next day conducting extensive repairs before sending ''Santa Dorotea'' to Earl St Vincent off Cadiz. The captured ship was purchased into the Royal Navy and served for several years as HMS ''Santa Dorotea'', rated at 36-guns.<ref name="WLC560">Clowes, p. 560</ref> The [[prize money]] generated by the sale of the captured ship and the stores aboard was paid out to the Dixon's crew in October 1800.<ref name="LG3">{{LondonGazette|issue=15305|startpage=1219|date=25 October 1800|accessdate=17 November 2009}}</ref> Nearly five decades later the Admiralty recognized the action with the clasp "LION 15 JULY 1798" attached to the [[Naval General Service Medal (1847)|Naval General Service Medal]], awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.<ref name="LG4">{{LondonGazette|issue=20939|startpage=236|endpage=245|date=26 January 1849|accessdate=11 September 2009}}</ref> 

''Lion'' remained in the Western Mediterranean for the next two months, eventually joining with a squadron of four Portuguese ships of the line under the command of Tom<U+00E1>s Xavier Teles de Castro da Gama, [[Count of Vidigueira|Marquess de Niza]].<ref name="WJ188">James, p. 188</ref> In September, Niza's squadron was ordered to join Nelson in his search for the French and sailed eastwards, but while passing to the north of Malta they encountered a large convoy of battered vessels under Captain [[James Saumarez|Sir James Saumarez]]. These ships were seven British ships of the line and six captured French ships, all survivors of the [[Battle of the Nile]], Nelson's successful conclusion of the campaign fought at [[Aboukir Bay]] off Egypt on 1 August. The Anglo-Portuguese squadron continued to Alexandria in October, briefly joining the blockade squadron there under Captain [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Sir Samuel Hood]] before returning to Malta in December as part of a new squadron formed off the island.<ref name="WJ193">James, p. 193</ref> ''Lion'' followed the Portuguese back to Malta in December.<ref name="WLC377">Clowes, p. 377</ref> The Spanish did not launch another expedition from their Mediterranean ports during 1798.<ref name="WJ195">James, p. 195</ref>
