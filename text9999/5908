The '''mountain banksia''' (''Banksia canei'') is a species of shrub in the [[plant]] [[genus]] ''[[Banksia]]''. It occurs in [[subalpine]] areas of the [[Great Dividing Range]] between [[Melbourne]] and [[Canberra]] in southeastern Australia. Although no subspecies are recognised, four [[topodemes]] (geographically isolated populations) have been described, as there is significant variation in the shape of both adult and juvenile leaves between populations. Although superficially resembling  ''[[Banksia marginata|B. marginata]]'', it is more closely related to another subalpine species,  ''[[Banksia saxicola|B. saxicola]]''.

''Banksia canei'' is generally encountered as a many-branched [[shrub]] that grows up to 3&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft) high, with narrow leaves and the yellow [[inflorescence]]s (flower spikes) appearing from late summer to early winter. The old flowers fall off the spikes, and up to 150 finely furred [[Follicle (fruit)|follicles]] develop, which remain closed until burnt in a [[bushfire]]. Each follicle bears two winged seeds. Response to fire is poorly known, although it is thought to regenerate by seed. Birds such as the [[Yellow-tufted Honeyeater]] and various insects forage among the flower spikes. It is frost tolerant in cultivation, but copes less well with aridity or humidity, and is often short-lived in gardens. One [[cultivar]], ''Banksia'' "Celia Rosser" was registered in 1978, but has subsequently vanished.

==Description==
''Banksia canei'' grows as a woody shrub to 3&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft) in height, usually with many branches. Its bark is smooth with horizontal [[lenticel]]s, initially reddish-brown before fading to grey tones. The stiff leaves are [[Phyllotaxis|arranged]] alternately along the stems and show significant variation in shape and size. Adult leaves are linear or narrowly [[wikt:obovate|obovate]] in shape, and generally measure 2<U+2013>5&nbsp;cm (0.8<U+2013>2&nbsp;in), though some populations have leaves as short as 1&nbsp;cm (0.4&nbsp;in) or as long as 10&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;in).<ref name=George81>{{The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)}}</ref> The juvenile leaves are generally larger and wider with [[wikt:dentate|dentate]] margins.<ref name=salkin170>Salkin, p. 170.</ref> New growth is seen mainly from February to April. The complex flower spikes, known as [[inflorescence]]s, appear between December and May, peaking over February to April.<ref name=banksiaatlas>{{cite book | author=Taylor, Anne; [[Stephen Hopper|Hopper, Stephen]] | year=1988 | title = [[The Banksia Atlas]] (Australian Flora and Fauna Series Number 8) | pages= 74<U+2013>75| location = Canberra, Australian Capital Territory | publisher = Australian Government Publishing Service | isbn = 0-644-07124-9}}</ref><!-- cites previous two sentences -->  They arise from [[node (botany)|nodes]] of 1<U+2013>3-year-old branchlets or can be terminal.

They are generally 5<U+2013>10&nbsp;cm (2<U+2013>4&nbsp;in) high and 3<U+2013>5&nbsp;cm (1.2<U+2013>2&nbsp;in) wide, but some do reach 15&nbsp;cm (6&nbsp;in) high. [[Mauve]]-tinted in bud, they generally open to become pale yellow in colour. As with most banksias, [[anthesis]] is [[wikt:acropetal|acropetal]]; the opening of the individual buds proceeds up the flower spike from the base to the top. The flower limbs may be pale grey or blue-tinged, while the styles are yellow.<ref name=George81/> As the inflorescences age, the old flowers fall away leaving a naked spike.

==Taxonomy==
''Banksia canei'' was first described in 1967 by [[James Hamlyn Willis|James H. Willis]], who had collected it on 27 November 1962 along the Mt. Seldom Seen track in the vicinity of [[Wulgulmerang, Victoria]].<ref name=George99>{{cite book|author=George, Alex|year=1999|chapter=Banksia|editor=Wilson, Annette (ed.)|title=Flora of Australia: Volume 17B: Proteaceae 3: Hakea to Dryandra|pages=175<U+2013>251|publisher=CSIRO Publishing / Australian Biological Resources Study|location=Collingwood, Victoria |isbn=0-643-06454-0|authorlink=Alex George}}</ref> Earlier collections include a specimen [[Ferdinand von Mueller]] had collected near [[Omeo, Victoria|Omeo]] in 1853, and one found by [[Richard Hind Cambage]] in 1908 near Kydra Peak. However, neither botanist considered this to be a new species at the time, instead holding it to be an unusual mountain [[Form (botany)|form]] of  the locally widespread ''[[Banksia marginata|B.&nbsp;marginata]]''.<ref name="salkin78"/> Willis named the species after Victorian plantsman Bill Cane who had alerted authorities to the existence of an unusual banksia that was distinct from ''B.&nbsp;marginata'' some years previously.<ref name=George81/> At the time, a plant collected from Mount Fulton near [[Port Davey]] in [[South West Tasmania]] was thought to be ''B.&nbsp;canei'', but it was later reassessed as ''B.&nbsp;marginata''.<ref name="salkin78"/> ''B.&nbsp;canei'' can be distinguished by its larger follicles and sharp points to the leaves.<ref name=blake85>{{cite journal|author=Blake, Trevor|year=1985|title=Eastern ''Banksia'' of the ''B. integrifolia'' group|journal=Australian Plants|volume=13|issue=105|pages=200<U+2013>07|issn=0005-0008}}</ref> In his 1981 monograph of the genus ''Banksia'', [[Alex George]] noted that despite a superficial resemblance to ''B.&nbsp;marginata'', its bare old cones and stouter foliage indicated a closer relationship to ''[[Banksia integrifolia|B. integrifolia]]'' and  ''[[Banksia saxicola|B.&nbsp;saxicola]]'',<ref name=George81/> although it lacks the latter species' whorled [[Phyllotaxis|leaf arrangement]].<ref name=blake85/> A fossil species, ''[[Banksia kingii|B. kingii]]'' from the late [[Pleistocene]] of [[Melaleuca Inlet]] in southwestern Tasmania, has robust foliage and [[infructescence]] resembling those of ''B.&nbsp;canei'' and ''B.&nbsp;saxicola'', and appears to be a recently extinct relative.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Jordan, Gregory J.; Hill, Robert S. | year = 1991 | title = Two New ''Banksia'' Species from Pleistocene Sediments in Western Tasmania | journal = Australian Systematic Botany | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 499<U+2013>511 | doi = 10.1071/SB9910499}}</ref> The leaf of a much older fossil species ''[[Banksieaephyllum acuminatum]]'' from [[Oligocene]] deposits in the [[Latrobe Valley]] closely resembles ''B.&nbsp;canei'' in shape, anatomy and vein pattern.<ref name=salkin151>Salkin, p. 151.</ref>

The current [[Taxonomy|taxonomic]] arrangement of the ''Banksia'' genus is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the ''[[Flora of Australia (series)|Flora of Australia]]'' book series.<ref name=George99/> In this arrangement, ''B.&nbsp;canei'' is placed in ''Banksia'' [[subgenus]] ''[[Banksia subg. Banksia|Banksia]]'', because its inflorescences take the form of ''Banksia''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s characteristic flower spikes; [[Section (botany)|section]] [[Banksia sect. Banksia|''Banksia'']] because of its straight [[carpel|styles]]; and [[Series (botany)|series]] [[Banksia ser. Salicinae|''Salicinae'']] because its inflorescences are cylindrical. [[Kevin Thiele]] placed it in a subseries ''Integrifoliae'', where he found strong support for it and ''B.&nbsp;saxicola'' to be each other's closest relative. The two were a sister group (i.e. next closest relative) to the four then-recognised subspecies of ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia''. The subseries all bear whorled leaves apart from ''B.&nbsp;canei'' and ''B.&nbsp;aquilonia''.<ref name="Thiele 1996">{{cite journal | author = [[Kevin Thiele|Thiele, Kevin]]; Ladiges, Pauline Y. | year = 1996 | title = A Cladistic Analysis of ''Banksia'' (Proteaceae) | journal = [[Australian Systematic Botany]] | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 661<U+2013>733 | doi = 10.1071/SB9960661}}</ref> However, this subgrouping of the ''Salicinae'' was not supported by George. He did place the two [[Subalpine zone|subalpine]] taxa (''canei'' and ''saxicola'') at the end of the sequence as he thought they were the most recently evolved species, since he considered the group to have a tropical origin and ''B.&nbsp;dentata'' to be the oldest lineage.<ref name=George99/>

Since 1998, American botanist [[Austin Mast]] and co-authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of [[DNA sequence]] data for the subtribe [[Grevilleoideae|Banksiinae]], which then comprised genera ''Banksia'' and ''[[Banksia ser.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Banksia canei map.png|thumb|left|Distribution of ''Banksia canei'' across Victoria and far southeastern New South Wales]]
Several [[disjunct distribution|disjunct]] populations of ''Banksia canei'' have been recorded across alpine areas of southeastern Australia, generally at altitudes of 500 to 1000&nbsp;m (1500<U+2013>4000&nbsp;ft) in northeastern Victoria and southeastern [[New South Wales]].

In 1975, as part of a study on the four populations of ''B.&nbsp;canei'', Salkin carried out germination experiments, producing around a thousand seedlings. In January that year, two seedlings from the Wulgulmerang population displayed deeply lobed ([[wikt:pinnatisect|pinnatisect]]) leaves and a [[prostrate shrub|prostrate]] habit. One died, but in April two seedlings from the Wellington River seed appeared which bore the same appearance. Both these younger seedlings died, but the one older plant survived.

It produced flower spikes 4&nbsp;cm (1.6&nbsp;in) high and  4&nbsp;cm (1.6&nbsp;in) wide, which made up for their small size by their abundance.
