'''''Kid A''''' is the fourth album by the [[England|English]] [[rock music|rock]] band [[Radiohead]], released in 2000.  A commercial success worldwide,<ref name="ES"/> ''Kid A'' went [[platinum record|platinum]] in its first week of release in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bpi.co.uk/|title = BPI Certified Awards|publisher = BPI|accessdate = 2007-05-16}}</ref> Despite the lack of an official [[single (music)|single]] or [[music video|video]] as publicity, ''Kid A'' became the only Radiohead release to debut at #1 in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web|title=CD Soars After Net Release: Radiohead's 'Kid A' premieres in No. 1 slot|last=Evangelista|first=Benny|accessdate=2007-03-17|date=2000-10-12|work=San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/10/12/BU108599.DTL&type=tech_article}}</ref> This success was credited variously to a unique marketing campaign, the early [[Internet leak]] of the album,<ref name="ZORIC"/> or anticipation after the band's previous album, ''[[OK Computer]]'' (1997).<ref name="NME"/>

''Kid A'' was recorded in [[Paris]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Gloucestershire]] and [[Oxford]] with [[record producer|producer]] [[Nigel Godrich]]. The album's songwriting and recording were [[experimental rock|experimental]] for Radiohead,<ref name="REYNOLDS"/> as the band replaced the "anthemic" style of their 1997 album ''[[OK Computer]]'' with a more [[electronic music|electronic]] sound.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gilbert|first=Ben|title=Radiohead - "Kid A"|work=Dotmusic|date=2000-09-29|url=http://uk.launch.yahoo.com/l_reviews_a/15624.html|accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref> Influenced by [[Krautrock]],<ref name="ECCLESTON"/> [[jazz]],<ref name="JUICE"/> and [[20th century classical music]],<ref name="SMITH"/> Radiohead incorporated a wide range of instruments on ''Kid A'', replacing their older three-guitar arrangement with keyboards, the [[Ondes martenot]], and, on certain compositions, [[Horn (instrument)|horns]] and [[trombone]]s.<ref name="ECCLESTON"/>  ''Kid A'' also contains more minimal and abstract lyrics than the band's previous work.<ref name="QUOTES"/> Singer [[Thom Yorke]] has said the album was not intended as "art", but reflects the music they listened to at the time.<ref name="THOM">{{cite web| url=http://radiohead1.tripod.com/band/thomquotes.htm| title=Radiohead - Thom Yorke Quotes|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> Original artwork by [[Stanley Donwood]] and Yorke, and a series of short animated films called "blips", accompanied the album.

It also received praise for introducing listeners to diverse forms of [[underground music]].<ref name="REYNOLDS"/> ''Kid A'' had sold more than 1.3 million copies as of 2003.<ref name = "RS428">{{cite web|title = 428) Kid A|url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6626855/428_kid_a| work = Rolling Stone| date=2003-11-01| accessdate = 2007-05-18}}</ref>

==Background==
By 1998, the attention Radiohead had received from ''OK Computer'' had become a strain, particularly for singer Thom Yorke.<ref name="SMITH">{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Andrew|work=The Observer|accessdate=2007-05-19|title=Sound and fury |date=2000-10-01|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,375564,00.html}}</ref> His feelings of [[globalization|global]] speed and dislocation, which inspired songs on ''OK Computer'',<ref>{{cite web|work=Citizeninsane.eu| title=Making OK Computer| url=http://www.citizeninsane.eu/okcomputersessions.html| accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref> had intensified on the 1997-1998 "Running From Demons" world tour.<ref name = "MEETING">{{cite video|people=Radiohead (interviews)|title=Meeting People Is Easy|year=1998|date=11-30|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0195909/|publisher=Seventh art releasing|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref>  As documented in Grant Gee's 1999 film ''[[Meeting People Is Easy]]'',<ref name="ZORIC"/> Radiohead unveiled new songs on the tour, including what was then known as "How to Disappear Completely and Never Be Found",<ref name="NEPAS">{{cite web|work=Ne Pas Avaler|year=2000|url=http://www.nepasavaler.net/songs/howtodisappearcompletely.htm|title=How to disappear completely|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref> but the band had difficulty recording them.<ref name="MEETING"/> 

While Yorke was receiving praise for his music, he became openly hostile towards the media.<ref name="ZORIC"/><ref name="NME">{{cite web|work=NME|date=2000-12-23|url=http://www.followmearound.com/presscuttings.php?year=2000&cutting=104|title=NME Christmas Double Issue|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref> He believed his songs had become part of a constant background noise he described as "fridge buzz".<ref name = "MEETING" /> Yorke felt that "all the sounds you made, that made you happy, have been sucked of everything they meant",<ref name="ZORIC"/> and he suffered depression as he struggled to write new music.<ref name="ECCLESTON">{{cite web|last=Eccleston|first=Danny|title=(Radiohead article)|work=Q Magazine| year=2000| month=October| url=http://www.followmearound.com/presscuttings.php?year=2000&cutting=89&PHPSESSID=c033bc19e81ba698894f33e264541fc4| accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref>  Yorke said that in late 1998, "Every time I picked up a guitar I just got the horrors. I would start writing a song, stop after 16 bars, hide it away in a drawer, look at it again, tear it up, destroy it".<ref name="ECCLESTON"/> Radiohead members decided to continue, but bassist [[Colin Greenwood]] said, "we felt we had to change everything".<ref name="COLIN"/>

==Recording and production==
When Radiohead began work on the album early in 1999, the members had differing ideas as to the musical direction they should take. [[Ed O'Brien]] wanted to strip the band's style down to direct, three minute guitar pop songs,<ref name="ECCLESTON"/> while Yorke felt their past efforts with rock music had "missed the point". Yorke said he had "completely had it with melody. I just wanted rhythm".<ref name="ECCLESTON"/> Yorke had been a DJ and part of a [[techno]] band at [[Exeter University]],<ref name="SMITH"/>  and began to listen almost exclusively to electronic music, saying, "I felt just as emotional about it as I'd ever felt about guitar music".<ref name="ECCLESTON"/> He liked the idea of his voice being used as an instrument rather than having a leading role in the album.<ref name="REYNOLDS"/>

Work began on ''Kid A'' with ''OK Computer'' producer [[Nigel Godrich]], without a deadline from the label.<ref name="ZORIC"/> Yorke, who had the greatest control within the band, was still facing [[writer's block]].<ref name="ECCLESTON"/> His new songs were incomplete, and some consisted of little more than a [[drum machine]] rhythm<ref name="ECCLESTON"/> and lyric fragments he had drawn from a hat. The band rehearsed briefly and began recording at a studio in [[Paris]], but rejected their work after a month and moved to Medley studios in [[Copenhagen]] for two weeks. Some music from early 1999 was incorporated into the album, often unrecognisable from its original form ("[[In Limbo]]", originally known as "Lost at Sea", dates from this time). According to band members, however, the period was largely unproductive.<ref name="ECCLESTON"/>

O'Brien began to keep an online studio diary of the band's progress.<ref name="DIARY">{{cite web|url=http://www.greenplastic.com/coldstorage/articles/edsdiary/index.php|title=Ed's Diary|date=1999-07-22 to 2000-06-26|accessdate=2007-05-19|last=O'Brien|first=Ed}}</ref> He later described Radiohead's change in style during this period: "If you're going to make a different-sounding record, you have to change the methodology. And it's scary<U+2014>everyone feels insecure. I'm a guitarist and suddenly it's like, well, there are no guitars on this track, or no drums".<ref name="ECCLESTON"/> Drummer [[Phil Selway]] also found it hard to adjust to the recording sessions.<ref name="ECCLESTON"/>

[[Image:Edsnl2000.JPG|thumb|left|160px|[[Ed O'Brien]] performing with Radiohead in 2000. O'Brien struggled at first with the band's change in style.]]
In April 1999, recording resumed in a [[Gloucestershire]] mansion before moving to the band's long-planned studio in [[Oxford]], which was completed in September 1999. In line with Yorke's new musical direction, the band members began to experiment with different instruments, and to learn "how to be a participant in a song without playing a note".<ref name="ECCLESTON"/> The rest of the band gradually grew to share Yorke's passion for synthesised sounds.<ref name="ROSS">{{cite news | first=Alex | last=Ross | coauthors= | title=The Searchers: Radiohead's unquiet revolution | date=[[2001-08-21]] | publisher= | url =http://www.therestisnoise.com/2004/04/mahler_1.html | work =The New Yorker | pages = | accessdate = 2007-03-26 | language = }}</ref> They also used digital tools like [[Pro Tools]] and [[Cubase]] to manipulate their recordings. O'Brien said, "everything is wide open with the technology now. The permutations are endless".<ref name="ECCLESTON"/> By the end of the year, six songs were complete, including the [[Kid A (song)|title song]].<ref name="ECCLESTON"/>

Early in 2000 [[Jonny Greenwood]], the only Radiohead member trained in [[music theory]], composed a string arrangement for "[[How to Disappear Completely]]", which he recorded with the Orchestra of St. John's in [[Dorchester Abbey]].<ref name="MM">{{cite web|work=Melody Maker|title=Radiohead Revealed: The Inside Story of the Year's Most Important Album|date=2000-03-29|url=http://www.followmearound.com/presscuttings.php?year=2000&cutting=66|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref> He played [[Ondes Martenot]] on the track,<ref name="NEPAS"/> as well as on "[[Optimistic (song)|Optimistic]]" and "[[The National Anthem]]". Yorke played bass on "The National Anthem" (known during the sessions as "Everyone"<ref name="DIARY"/>), a track Radiohead had once attempted to record as a [[b-side]] for ''OK Computer''. Trying it again for ''Kid A'', Yorke wanted it to feature a [[Charles Mingus]]-inspired [[horn section]], and he and Jonny "conducted" the jazz musicians to sound like a "traffic jam".<ref>{{cite web|work=Citizeninsane.eu|title=The National Anthem|url=http://www.citizeninsane.eu/thenationalanthemquotes.htm|accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref> Jonny and his brother Colin Greenwood also began experimenting with [[sampling (music)|sampling]] their own and other artists' music.<ref>{{cite web|work=AtEaseweb.com|title=discography|url=http://www.ateaseweb.com/discography/kida/index.php|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref> One such sample yielded the basic track for "[[Idioteque]]", which Yorke sang over. Despite their change in direction, Colin still described Radiohead as being a rock band.<ref name="COLIN">{{cite web|last=Kot|first=Greg|title=Radiohead sends out new signals with 'Kid A'|work=Nigelgodrich.com|year=2000|url=http://www.nigelgodrich.com/press5.htm|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref> Jonny Greenwood summarised their recording sessions for ''Kid A'':<ref>{{cite web | last=Greenwood | first=Jonny | work=Spin With a Grin | title=Questions and Answers | url=http://www.spinwithagrin.com/answer.asp?show=all | publisher=Radiohead, SpinWithaGrin.com | date=2000 | accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref>

{{cquote|I don't remember much time playing keyboards. It was more an obsession with sound, speakers, the whole artifice of recording. I see it like this: a voice into a microphone onto a tape, onto your CD, through your speakers is all as illusory and fake as any synthesizer - it doesn't put Thom in your front room - but one is perceived as 'real' the other, somehow 'unreal'... It was just freeing to discard the notion of acoustic sounds being truer.}}

Radiohead finished recording during the spring of 2000, having completed almost 30 new songs.<ref name="DIARY"/> Preferring to avoid a [[double album]],<ref name="REYNOLDS"/> the band saved many of the songs for their next release, 2001's ''[[Amnesiac]]''. Yorke obsessed over potential running orders<ref name="NYROCK">{{cite interview|subject=Radiohead| interviewer=''NY Rock''|month=December |year=2000|url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/2000/radiohead.asp|accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref> and the band argued over the track list,<ref name="DIARY"/> reportedly bringing them close to a breakup.<ref name="SMITH"/> It was eventually decided that ''Kid A'' would begin with "[[Everything in Its Right Place]]". Yorke felt the song, which was written on a [[piano]] and computer, was most representative of the new record, and initially wanted to release it as a single.<ref>{{cite web|work=AtEaseweb.com|title=news|date=2002-05-12|url=http://www.ateaseweb.com/news/archive/2002/05/index.php|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref>  Final [[audio mixing|mixing]] was completed by Godrich, and [[mastering]] of ''Kid A'' took place at [[Abbey Road Studios]] under Chris Blair.

==Marketing and release==
After finishing the record, the band, with their label, drew up a marketing plan. One [[EMI]] executive praised the music but described "the business challenge of making everyone believe" in it.<ref name="COHEN">{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Warren|work=Inside.com|title=With Radiohead's Kid A, Capitol Busts Out of a Big-Time Slump.

Capitol created the "iBlip", a [[Java applet]] which could be embedded into fan sites, allowing users to [[pre-order]] the album and listen to [[streaming audio]] before its release.<ref name="COHEN"/> No advance copies were circulated,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1852617|title=New Radiohead Album Floods The Internet|accessdate=2007-03-22|work=Billboard.com|date=2003-03-31}}</ref> but the album was played under carefully controlled conditions for critics and at listening parties for fans,<ref>{{cite web|last=Gold|first=Kerry|title=Control Freaks|work=The Vancouver Sun|date=2000-09-16| url=http://www.followmearound.com/presscuttings.php?year=2000&cutting=84|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref> and was previewed in its entirety on [[MTV2]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Goldsmith|first=Charles|title=Radiohead's New Marketing|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=2000-09-18|url=http://www.followmearound.com/presscuttings.php?year=2000&cutting=86|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref>

The band made a brief tour of [[Mediterranean]] countries in early summer 2000, playing their new songs live for the first time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.followmearound.com/presscuttings.php?year=2000&cutting=75 |last=Oldham|first=James|title=Radiohead - Their Stupendous Return|work= NME|date=2000-06-24|accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref> By the time the album's title was announced in mid-2000, concert [[Bootleg recording|bootlegs]] were being shared on the [[peer-to-peer]] service [[Napster]].

The string orchestration for "How to Disappear" was influenced by Polish composer [[Krzysztof Penderecki]].<ref name="ZORIC"/> Jonny Greenwood's use of the Ondes Martenot on this and several other ''Kid A'' songs was inspired by [[Olivier Messiaen]], who popularised the early electronic instrument and was one of Greenwood's teenage heroes.<ref name="GILL">{{cite news|last=Gill| first=Andy| title = "So long to Jonny guitar"| work = The Independent| date = 2003-10-31| url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20031031/ai_n12721317| accessdate = 2007-04-23}}</ref> "Idioteque" [[sample (music)|sampled]] the work of [[Paul Lansky]] and Arthur Kreiger, [[contemporary music|classical]] composers involved in [[computer music]].

===Lyrics===
''Kid A'' was the first Radiohead album since the band's debut ''[[Pablo Honey]]'' (1993) whose lyrics were not officially released or published in its [[liner notes]]. Thom Yorke, who wrote all the lyrics, explained this by saying the words could not be considered separately from the music.<ref name="NYROCK"/> He said he used a vocal manipulation to distance himself from the title track's "brutal and horrible" subject matter, which he could not have sung otherwise.<ref name="REYNOLDS"/> For at least some of the lyrics, Yorke [[cut-up technique|cut up]] words and phrases and drew them from a hat.<ref name="QUOTES">{{cite web|work=Citizeninsane.eu| title='Kid A' Quotes| url=http://www.citizeninsane.eu/kidaquotes.htm| accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> [[Tristan Tzara]]'s similar technique for writing "[[dada]] poetry" was posted on Radiohead's official web site during the recording.<ref>{{cite web|title = The Dadaists and Radiohead | date = 1999 | url=http://transcriptions.english.ucsb.edu/archive/courses/liu/english165/student-papers/jensen.html | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref> [[Post-punk]] bands who influenced Radiohead were also known to employ the technique.<ref name="REYNOLDS"/>

According to Yorke, the album's title was not a reference to ''Kid A in Alphabet Land'', a trading card set dealing with the work of [[psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]].<ref name="SMITH"/> Yorke suggested that the title could refer to the first [[human clone]],<ref>{{cite web|title = RHMB posting| last=Yorke| first = Thom| date = 2000-07-30| url = http://www.indyrock.es/newalbum.htm| accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref> but denied he had a [[concept album|concept]] or [[rock opera|story]] in mind. On another occasion, Yorke said "Kid A" was the nickname of a synthesiser used on the album.<ref>{{cite web|work = At Ease|title = Discography| url = http://www.ateaseweb.com/discography/kida/index.php|accessdate = 2007-04-24}}</ref> Yorke said, "if you call it something specific, it drives the record in a certain way. I like the non-meaning".<ref name="SMITH"/>

Band members read Naomi Klein's [[anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]] book ''[[No Logo]]'' while recording the album, recommended it to fans on their website, and considered calling the album "No Logo" for a time.<ref name="ECCLESTON"/> Yorke also cited George Monbiot's ''[[Captive State|Captive State: The Corporate Takeover of Britain]]'' as an influence.<ref name="REYNOLDS"/> The artwork by Yorke and Stanley Donwood that accompanied the album, including a "hidden booklet" found under the compact disc tray (see [[#Artwork|below]]), was seen to take a more explicit stance toward political leaders, and referenced issues of war, [[climate change]] and [[genetic modification]].<ref name="LEBLANC"/> Yorke and other band members were involved in the movement against [[third world debt]] during this period,<ref name="ZORIC"/> and they also spoke out on other issues. Some feel ''Kid A'' conveys an anti-[[consumerism|consumerist]] viewpoint, expressing the band's perception of global [[capitalism]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Radiohead Unpackt (web archive)|last=Rivera|first=Adam|date=2003|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050216080819/www.sas.upenn.edu/~adrivera/tsp1.html|accessdate=2005-10-01}}</ref> In 2005, music journalist [[Chuck Klosterman]] speculated that ''Kid A'' was a soundtrack to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and beyond,<ref>{{cite web|title=Review of Chuck Klosterman's 'Killing Yourself to Live'|last=Lewis|first=Georgie|date=2005-06-25|url=http://www.powells.com/review/2005_06_25.html|work=Powell's Books|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> despite ''Kid A'' being written, recorded and released before the attacks.

Yorke said the album was partly about "the generation that will inherit the earth when we've wiped evrything [sic] out".<ref>{{cite web|title =Kid A Interpretation (Thom Yorke quoted, likely from one of his RHMB postings)| last=Yorke| first = Thom| date = 2000| url = http://home.att.ne.jp/air/tony/radiohead/Kid_A_interpretation.htm| accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref> However, he has refused to explain his songwriting in political terms.<ref>{{cite news|last=Burton|first=Sarah|title=Duty of Expression: Thom Yorke and Howard Zinn debate the artist's role...| work=Resonance Magazine| date=2003| url=http://www.resonancemag.com/feature_01.html| accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> Some songs were personal, inspired by dreams.<ref>{{cite web|work=Citizeninsane.eu| title='How to Disappear Completely' Quotes| url=http://www.citizeninsane.eu/htdcquotes.htm| accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> Other lyrics were inspired by advice Yorke received from friends. The lyrics, "I'm not here, this isn't happening" in "How to Disappear Completely," were taken from [[Michael Stipe]]'s advice to Yorke about coping with the pressures of touring.<ref name = "NEPAS"/> The chorus of "Optimistic", "If you try the best you can, the best you can is good enough", was inspired by Yorke's partner, Rachel Owen.<ref name="ECCLESTON"/>

==Imagery==
===Videos and blips===
No conventional [[music videos]] were initially released from ''Kid A'', but short films called "blips" were set to its music. They were usually around 30 seconds in length. The blips were shown between segments on [[MTV]], occasionally as TV commercials for the album, and were distributed free from Radiohead's website. As of May 2007, they are still available from an unofficial fan site.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.pulk-pull.org/video-sundries/kid-a-antivideos/|title = Kid A Antivideos |work = Pulk-Pull| date=2006-04-08|accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref>

Each blip was made by one of two collectives: The Vapour Brothers or [[Shynola]]. Most blips were animated, often inspired by Stanley Donwood's album artwork. The blips have been seen as stories of nature reclaiming civilization from uncontrollable [[biotechnology]] and consumerism. Characters in the blips included "sperm monsters" and blinking, genetically modified killer [[teddy bear]]s, the latter of which became a self-conscious logo for the album's advertising campaign.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Tate| first = Joseph| title = Radiohead's Anti-videos: Works of Art in the Age of Electronic Reproduction.| journal = Postmodern Culture| month = May|year = 2002| Volume = 12| issue = 3| url = http://www3.iath.virginia.edu/pmc/issue.502/12.3tate.html|accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref>

A more traditional video was released in late 2000: the band performing an alternate version of "Idioteque" in the studio. Several months later a video was released for "Motion Picture Soundtrack", which entirely consisted of material from the blips. Yorke described it as "the most beautiful piece of film that was ever made for our music".<ref name="SWAG"/>

===Artwork===
[[Image:Glaciers.jpg||thumb|250px|left|A portion of [[Stanley Donwood]] and [[Tchock]]'s album art with the "red swimming pool" depicted in its centre.]]
The cover art, by Donwood and Tchock (an alias for Thom Yorke), is a [[computer generated imagery|computer rendering]] of a mountain range, with pixelated distortion near the bottom. It was a reflection of the war in [[Kosovo war|Kosovo]] in winter 1999. Donwood was affected by a photograph in ''[[The Guardian]]'', saying the war felt like it was happening in his own street.<ref name="ARTS">{{cite web|work = The Guardian|date = 2006-11-22|title = Arts Diary| url = http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1954021,00.html|accessdate=2007-04-24}}</ref> Influenced by triumphalist [[Victorian era]] military art depicting British colonial subjects,<ref name="SlowlyDownward">{{cite web| last = Donwood| first = Stanley| title = TXT1| url = http://www.slowlydownward.com/txt1.html| work = Slowly Downward| accessdate = 2007-04-25}}</ref> Donwood produced colourful [[oil painting]]s, creating a sharp texture with knives and putty.<ref name="LEBLANC">{{cite book |last= Leblanc|first= Lisa|editor= Tate, Joseph|title= The Music and Art of Radiohead | date= 2005-04-28|publisher= Ashgate|isbn= 0754639797|chapter= Ice Age Coming: The Apocalyptic Sublime in the Paintings of Stanley Donwood}}</ref> The back cover is a digitally modified depiction of another snowscape with fires raging through fields. ''Kid A'' came with a booklet of Donwood and Tchock artwork, printed on both glossy paper and thick tracing paper. Near the back there is a large [[triptych]]-style fold-out drawing.

[[Image:Kid A Hidden booklet.gif||thumb|180px|right|A "hidden booklet" was included in early pressings.]]
The red swimming pool on the spine of the CD case and on the disc represents what Donwood termed "a symbol of looming danger and shattered expectations". It came from the graphic novel ''[[Brought to Light]]'' by Alan Moore and Bill Sienkiewicz, in which the fictional [[CIA]] measures its killings through state sponsored terrorism by the equivalent number of 50-gallon swimming pools filled with human blood. This image haunted Donwood throughout the ''Kid A'' project.<ref>{{cite web|last = Donwood|first = Stanley|title = Bear over a swimming pool|work = Slowly Downward|url = http://shop.slowlydownward.com/Store/DisplayIndividualItem/1/575.html|accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref>  Early pressings of ''Kid A'' came with a booklet of artwork hidden under the CD tray.  The booklet contained political references, including a demonic portrait of [[Tony Blair]] surrounded by warnings of demagoguery.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ateaseweb.com/extra/kida-booklet|title = Booklet Hidden Behind a Compact Disc|accessdate = 2007-04-25|work = At Ease}}</ref>

A special edition of ''Kid A'' was also released, in a thick cardboard package in the style of a children's book with a new cover and different oil paintings of apocalyptic landscapes and modified bear images.  Although in the same style as the album art, Donwood's new paintings were without digital distortion. The book included a page with statistics on [[glacier]] melt rates, paralleling the art's themes of environmental degradation.<ref name="LEBLANC"/> In 2006, Donwood and Tchock exhibited Radiohead album artwork, in Barcelona, with a focus on ''Kid A''. An art book documenting the exhibition and its inspirations, called ''Dead Children Playing'', was made available through Donwood's website.<ref name="SlowlyDownward" />

==Reception==
''Kid A'' received considerable attention, but it divided listeners.<ref>{{cite web|last=Powers|first=Devon|work=Popmatters|title=Kid A|date= October 2000|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/r/radiohead-kida.shtml|accessdate=2007-03-31}}</ref>  [[Nick Hornby]], author and fan of Radiohead's earlier material, compared ''Kid A'' to Lou Reed's ''[[Metal Machine Music]]'', implying that it was an attempt at "commercial suicide" in order to escape from a label contract. He summarized a common source of opposition to the album in a review for ''The New Yorker'', lamenting the change in musical style from ''[[The Bends]]'' (1995) and ''OK Computer''.<ref>{{cite web|last=White|first=Curtis|url=http://www.centerforbookculture.org/context/no6/white.html|title=Kid Adorno|work=Context|accessdate=2007-03-31}} (This article is highly critical of Hornby's opinion of ''Kid A'' and the mentality his review is seen to reflect, with White seeing it as a justification for the album's existence.)</ref>  In 2001, Radiohead appeared on the cover of ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'', an experimental music magazine that usually ignores trends in alternative rock, and earned a feature interview by [[Simon Reynolds]], championing ''Kid A'' and its follow-up ''Amnesiac'' and dismissing accusations that they lacked originality.<ref name="REYNOLDS"/>

Several American critics gave the album positive reviews,<ref name="NME"/> with ''[[Spin Magazine|Spin]]'' naming Radiohead "Band of the Year" and ''[[USA Today]]'' calling ''Kid A'' "the most eccentric album ever to debut at No. 1, setting Radiohead apart from an army of lock-stepping pop and rock acts."<ref>{{cite news|last=Gundersen|first=Edna|title=Radiohead: A band apart|work=USA Today|date=2000-12-28|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people11.htm|accessdate=2007-03-31}}</ref> French publications ''[[Les Inrockuptibles]]''<ref>{{cite web|year=2000|issue=259/260|work=Les Inrockuptibles|language=French|title=Kid A review|url=http://www.indyrock.es/newalbum.htm|accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref> and ''Magic'' gave ''Kid A'' highly favourable reviews.<ref>{{cite web|year=2000|month=September|work=Magic!|language=French|title=Kid A review|url=http://www.indyrock.es/newalbum.htm|accessdate=2007-03-31}}</ref> Readers of ''Les Inrocks'' also voted it album of the year.<ref name="ES"/> However, in the UK, ''Kid A'' disappointed and infuriated some critics who expected the band to be "rock saviours".<ref name="REYNOLDS"/> ''[[Melody Maker]]'' had said months in advance of the album, "If there's one band that promises to return rock to us, it's Radiohead".<ref name="MM"/> The album was later slated in the magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.followmearound.com/presscuttings.php?year=2000&cutting=85|date = 2000-09-20|work = Melody Maker|last=Beaumont|first=Mark|accessdate=2007-04-25|title=Radiohead Kid A}}</ref> ''[[New Musical Express|NME]]'' called it "a lengthy and over-analysed mistake" and "scared to commit itself emotionally", though giving it a 7/10.<ref name="NME"/>

Despite the lack of consensus, by the end of 2000 the album was appearing frequently in critics' top ten lists<ref>{{cite web|title=Kid A|work=Acclaimed music|url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/061024/A1081.htm|accessdate=2007-03-31}}</ref> as praise for Radiohead's experimentation appeared to outweigh reservations.<ref name="META"/> In 2001, ''Kid A'' received a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] nomination for Album of the Year, and won Best Alternative Album and [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical|Best Engineered Album]]. {{RS500|428}} In 2005, two popular [[independent music|indie music]] publications, ''[[Pitchfork Media]]''<ref>{{cite web|work=Pitchfork|title=Top 100 albums of 2000-2004| url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/top/2000-04/index10.shtml| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060306033536/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/top/2000-04/index10.shtml| archivedate=2006-03-06| accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref> and ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'',<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/weekly_article/the-top-50-albums-2000-2005.htm Stylus| title= The Top 50 albums, 2000-2005|work=Stylus magazine|accessdate=2007-04-01|date=2005-01-18}}</ref> each separately named ''Kid A'' the best album of the past five years.
