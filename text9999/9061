The '''Suffolk Punch''', also historically known as the '''Suffolk Horse''' or '''Suffolk Sorrel''',<ref name=HistoricBreeds>Dohner, ''Encyclopedia of Historic and Endangered Livestock and Poultry Breeds'' pp. 349&ndash;352</ref> is an English [[list of horse breeds|breed]] of [[Draft horse|draught horse]].  The breed takes the first part of its name from the county of [[Suffolk]] in [[East Anglia]], and the name "Punch" from its solid appearance and strength.<ref>Hendricks, ''International Encyclopedia of Horse Breeds'', pp. 405&ndash;406</ref> It is a heavy draught horse which is always [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] in colour, although the colour is traditionally spelled "chesnut" by the [[breed registry|breed registries]]. Suffolk Punches are known as [[easy keeper|good doer]]s, and tend to have energetic [[horse gait|gaits]].

The breed was developed in the early 16th century, and remains similar in [[phenotype]] to its [[Foundation bloodstock|founding stock]].  The Suffolk Punch was developed for farm work, and gained popularity during the early 20th century. However, as agriculture became increasingly mechanised, the breed fell out of favour, particularly from the middle part of the century, and almost disappeared completely.  Although the breed's status is listed as critical by the UK [[Rare Breeds Survival Trust]] and the [[American Livestock Breeds Conservancy]], there has been a resurgence in interest, and population numbers are increasing. As well as being used for farm work, the breed pulled [[artillery]] and non-motorised commercial vans and buses.  It was also exported to other countries to upgrade local equine stock.

==Characteristics==
The Suffolk Punch generally stands 16.1 to 17.2 [[Hand (length)|hand]]s tall ({{convert|65|to|70|in|cm|0|disp=/}}),<ref name=HistoricBreeds350>Dohner, ''Encyclopedia of Historic and Endangered Livestock and Poultry Breeds'' p. 350</ref> and weighs {{convert|1980|to|2200|lb|kg}},<ref name="Bongianni">Bongianni, ''Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses and Ponies'', Entry 95</ref>  and is always [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] in colour. The traditional spelling, still used by the Suffolk Horse Society, is "chesnut" (with no "t" in the middle of the word).<ref name=HistoricBreeds/> Horses of the breed come in many different shades of chestnut, ranging from dark to red to light.<ref name=FAQ>{{cite web|url=http://www.suffolkpunch.com/info/faqs.html|title=Frequently Asked Suffolk Questions|accessdate=2008-08-31|publisher=American Suffolk Horse Association}}</ref> Suffolk [[horse breeding|horse breeders]] in the UK use several different colour terms specific to the breed, including dark [[liver (color)|liver]], dull dark, red and bright.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suffolkhorsesociety.org.uk/stallion-list/|title=Stallion List|publisher=Suffolk Horse Society|accessdate=2009-01-11}}</ref> White [[horse markings|markings]] are rare and generally limited to small areas on the face and lower legs.<ref name="Suffolk">{{cite web | title = Suffolk| url = http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/suffolk/index.htm| publisher =  Oklahoma State University| accessdate=2007-12-19}}</ref> Equestrian author [[Marguerite Henry]] described the breed by saying, "His color is bright chestnut &ndash; like a tongue of fire against black field furrows, against green corn blades, against yellow wheat, against blue horizons.

The Suffolk Punch tends to be shorter but more massively built than other British heavy draught breeds, such as the [[Clydesdale (horse)|Clydesdale]] or the [[Shire horse|Shire]], as a result of having been developed for agricultural work rather than road haulage.<ref>Sponenberg, "The Proliferation of Horse Breeds", ''Horses Through Time'', p. 157</ref> The breed has a powerful, arching neck; well-muscled, sloping shoulders; a short, wide [[back (horse)|back]]; and a muscular, broad [[rump (animal)|croup]].  Legs are short and strong, with broad joints; sound, well-formed [[horse hoof|hooves]]; and little or no [[feathering (horse)|feathering]] on the [[fetlock]]s.<ref name="Bongianni"/>  The [[Horse gait|movement]] of the Suffolk Punch is said to be energetic, especially at the [[trot (horse gait)|trot]]. The breed tends to mature early, be long-lived, and is economical to keep, needing less [[fodder|feed]] than other horses of similar type and size.<ref>Edwards, ''Horses'', p. 232</ref>  They are hard workers, said to be willing to "pull a heavily laden wagon till [they] dropped".<ref>Thirsk, ''Chapters from the Agrarian History of England and Wales'', p. 46</ref>

In the past, the Suffolk was often criticised for its poor feet, having hooves that were too small for its body mass. This was corrected by the introduction of classes at major [[Horse show|shows]] in which hoof conformation and structure were judged. This practice, unique among horse breeds, resulted in such an improvement that the Suffolk Punch is now considered to have excellent foot conformation.<ref name=HistoricBreeds350/><ref name=Ryder19>Ryder-Davies, "The Suffolk", ''The Working Horse Manual'', p. 19</ref>

==History==
The Suffolk Punch [[breed registry|registry]] is the oldest English breed society.<ref name=Ryder18>Ryder-Davies, "The Suffolk", ''The Working Horse Manual'', p. 18</ref>  The first known mention of the Suffolk Punch is in [[William Camden]]'s ''Britannia'', published in 1586,<ref name=Edwards288>Edwards, ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse'', p. 288</ref> in which he describes a working horse of the eastern counties of England that is easily recognisable as the Suffolk Punch. This description makes them the oldest breed of horse that is recognisable in the same form today.<ref name=Ryder18/> They were developed in Norfolk and [[Suffolk]] in the east of England, a relatively isolated area. The local farmers developed the Suffolk Punch for farm work, for which they needed a horse with power, stamina, health, longevity, and docility, and they bred the Suffolk to comply with these needs.  Because the farmers used these horses on their land, they seldom had any to sell, which helped to keep the bloodlines [[purebred|pure]] and unchanged.<ref name="Suffolk"/>   

[[Image:Suffolk Punch Head2.jpg|thumb|right|Suffolk Punch head]]
The [[foundation bloodstock|foundation sire]] of the modern Suffolk Punch breed was a 15.2 hand ({{Convert|62|in|cm|0|disp=/}}) [[stallion]] foaled near [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]] in 1768 and owned by Thomas Crisp of [[Ufford, Suffolk|Ufford]].<ref name=Edwards288/>  At this time the breed was known as the Suffolk [[Sorrel (horse)|Sorrel]].<ref name=Hall>Hall, ''Two Hundred Years of British Livestock'', pp. 232&ndash;234</ref> This horse was never named, and is simply known as "Crisp's horse".<ref name=HistoricBreeds/>  Although it is commonly (and mistakenly) thought that this was the first horse of the breed, by the 1760s, all other male lines of the breed had died out, resulting in a [[Population bottleneck|genetic bottleneck]]. Another bottleneck occurred in the late 18th century.<ref name=Ryder18/>

In 1784, the breed was described as "15 hands ({{Convert|60|in|cm|0|disp=/}}) high, short and compact with bony legs, often light sorrel in color, gentle, tractable, strong" and with "shoulders loaded with flesh".<ref name=HistoricBreeds349>Dohner, ''Encyclopedia of Historic and Endangered Livestock and Poultry Breeds'' p. 349</ref>  During its development, the breed was influenced by the [[Norfolk Trotter]], [[Norfolk]] [[Cob (horse)|Cob]], and later the [[Thoroughbred]].  The uniform colouring derives in part from a small trotting stallion named Blakes Farmer, foaled in 1760.<ref name="Bongianni"/> Other breeds were [[Cross breeding|cross bred]] in an attempt to increase the size and stature of the Suffolk Punch, as well as to improve the shoulders, but they had little lasting influence, and the breed remains much as it was before any crossbreeding took place.<ref name=HistoricBreeds/>  The Suffolk Horse Society, formed in Britain in 1877 to promote the Suffolk Punch,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suffolkhorsesociety.org.uk/the-society/|title=The Society|publisher=Suffolk Horse Society|accessdate=2008-10-11}}</ref> published its first stud book in 1880.<ref name=Bailey>Bailey, ''Cyclopedia of American Agriculture'', pp. 495&ndash;496</ref> The first official exports of Suffolks to Canada took place in 1865.<ref name=HistoricBreeds/>  In 1880, the first Suffolks were imported into the United States, with more following in 1888 and 1903 to begin the breeding of Suffolk Punches in the US.  The American Suffolk Horse Association was established and published its first stud book in 1907.  By 1908, the Suffolk had also been exported from England to Spain, France, Germany, Austria, Russia, Sweden, various parts of Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Argentina and other countries.<ref name=Bailey/>

By the time of the [[First World War]], the Suffolk Punch had become a popular work horse on large farms in East Anglia due to its good temperament and excellent work ethic. It remained popular until the [[Second World War]], when a combination of the need for increased wartime food production (which resulted in many horses being sent to the slaughterhouse), and increased farm mechanisation which followed the war decimated population numbers.<ref>Ryder-Davies, "The Suffolk", ''The Working Horse Manual'', pp. 18&ndash;19</ref> Only nine foals were registered with the Suffolk Horse Society in 1966, but there has been a revival of interest in the breed since the late 1960s and numbers have risen continuously.<ref name=Ryder19/> The breed did remain rare, and in 1998 there were only 80 breeding [[mare]]s in Britain, producing around 40 foals per year.<ref name=Ryder19/>  In the United States, the American Suffolk Horse Association became inactive after the war and remained so for 15&nbsp;years, but restarted in May 1961 as the draught horse market began to recover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suffolkpunch.com/info/brochure.html|title=Online Brochure|publisher=American Suffolk Horse Association|accessdate=2008-10-10}}</ref> In the 1970s and early 1980s, the American registry allowed some [[Belgian (horse)|Belgian]]s to be bred to Suffolk Punches, but only the [[filly|fillies]] from these crosses were permitted registry with the American Suffolk Horse Association.<ref name=HistoricBreeds352-52>Dohner, ''Encyclopedia of Historic and Endangered Livestock and Poultry Breeds'' pp. 351&ndash;52</ref> 

As of 2001, horses bred with American bloodlines were not allowed to be registered with the British Association, and the breed was considered the rarest horse breed in Britain.<ref name=HistoricBreeds352>Dohner, ''Encyclopedia of Historic and Endangered Livestock and Poultry Breeds'' p. 352</ref> Although the Suffolk Punch population has continued to increase, the [[Rare Breeds Survival Trust]] of the UK considers their survival status critical, with between 800 and 1,200&nbsp;horses in the United States and around 150 in England.<ref name=FAQ/> The [[American Livestock Breeds Conservancy]] also lists the breed as critical.<ref name="albc">{{cite web |url=http://www.albc-usa.org/cpl/suffolk.html |title=Suffolk Horse|publisher=[[American Livestock Breeds Conservancy]]|accessdate=2009-01-07}}</ref> The Suffolk Horse Society recorded the births of 36 pure-bred foals in 2007, and a further 33 foals as of March 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suffolkhorsesociety.org.uk/news/|title=News|publisher=Suffolk Horse Society|accessdate=2008-10-10}}</ref>

==Uses==

The Suffolk Punch was used mainly for draught work on farms, but was also often used to pull heavy [[artillery]] in wartime.  Like other heavy horses, they were also used to pull non-motorised vans and other commercial vehicles.<ref name=Hall/>  Today, they are used for commercial forestry operations, for other draught work, and in advertising.<ref name=Ryder19/>  They are also used for [[crossbreed]]ing, to produce heavy [[sport horse]]s for use in [[show hunter|hunter]] and [[show jumping]] competition.<ref name=Hendricks406>Hendricks, ''The International Encyclopedia of Horse Breeds'', p. 406</ref>

The Suffolk Punch contributed significantly to the creation of the [[Jutland (horse)|Jutland]] breed in Denmark.  Oppenheimer LXII, a Suffolk Punch imported to Denmark in the 1860s by noted Suffolk dealer Oppenheimer of [[Hamburg]], was one of the founding stallions of the Jutland.  Oppenheimer specialised in selling Suffolk Punches, importing them to the Mecklenburg Stud in Germany.  The stallion Oppenheimer founded the Jutland breed's most important bloodline, through his descendant Oldrup Munkedal.<ref>Edwards, ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse'', p. 274</ref>  Suffolks were also exported to Pakistan in the 20th century, to be used in upgrading native breeds, and they have been crossed with Pakistani horses and [[donkey]]s to create army remounts and [[mule]]s.  Suffolks have adapted well to the Pakistani climate, despite their large size, and the programme has been successful.<ref name=Edwards288/> The [[Vladimir Heavy Draft]], a draught breed from the former [[USSR]], is another which has been influenced by the Suffolk.<ref>Edwards and Geddes, ''The Complete Horse Book'', p. 113</ref>
