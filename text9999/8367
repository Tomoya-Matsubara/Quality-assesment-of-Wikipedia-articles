'''Frank Black''' (born [[April 6]], [[1965]] as '''Charles Michael Kittridge Thompson IV''') is an [[United States|American]] [[singer]], [[songwriter]] and [[guitarist]].<ref name="blackname" /> Active since 1985, Black is best known as leader of the influential [[alternative rock]] band [[Pixies]], where he performed under the [[stage name]] '''Black Francis'''.<ref>When the Pixies reunited in 2004, he did not specify whether he was adopting his Black Francis pseudonym again.</ref> Following the band's breakup in 1993, he embarked on a solo career under his current pseudonym. After releasing two albums with [[4AD]], he left the label and formed a [[backing band]], '''Frank Black and the Catholics'''. Black reformed the Pixies in 2004 and continues to release solo records while touring and recording with the band.<ref name="nmepixies">{{cite web | url=http://www.nme.com/news/pixies/24809 | title=Pixies to begin work on new album | accessdate=2006-10-25 | publisher=NME}}</ref>

Black's vocal style has varied from a screaming, yowling delivery as lead vocalist of the Pixies to a more measured and melodical style in later Pixies' albums and solo career.<ref>Sisario, Ben.

As frontman of the Pixies, Black's songs (such as  "[[Where Is My Mind?]]" and "[[Debaser]]") received praise and citations from contemporaries, including [[Radiohead]]'s [[Thom Yorke]] and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s [[Kurt Cobain]]. Cobain once said that "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" was his attempt at trying to "rip off the Pixies".<ref name="theysaid">{{cite web | url=http://aleceiffel.free.fr/misc_said.html | title=They Said About the Pixies... | accessdate=2006-09-11 | author=Biel, Jean-Michel; Gourraud, Christophe}}</ref> However, in his solo work and records with the Catholics, he received fewer popular and critical accolades.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/id/2098075/ | title=Frank and the Pixies' reunion | accessdate=2006-11-19 | author=Abramovich, Alex | publisher=[[Slate.com]] | date=2004-04-01 | quote=He is 12 albums into a solo career of steadily diminishing returns.}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Youth and college===
Charles Thompson was born in {{city-state|Boston|Massachusetts}} on [[April 6]], [[1965]]. His father was a bar owner, and Thompson first lived in {{city-state|Los Angeles|California}} as a baby because his father wanted to "learn more about the restaurant and bar business".<ref name="pg4">Frank, Ganz, 2006. p .4</ref> Thompson was introduced to music at a young age, as his parents listened to 1960s [[folk rock]]. His first guitar was his mother's, a [[Yamaha]] [[classical guitar]] bought with money from his father's bar tips, which he started to play at age "11 or 12".<ref name="pg3" />

Thompson's family moved around, first with his natural father, and then his stepfather, a religious man who "pursued [[real estate]] on both coasts".<ref>His (natural) parents had separated twice by the time he was in first grade.</ref><ref name="sp10">Sisario, 2006. p. 10</ref> When Thompson was 12, his mother and stepfather joined a church that was tied to the evangelical [[Assemblies of God]],<ref name="sp10" /> a move that influenced many of his songs written with the Pixies, which often refer to the Bible.<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 11</ref>
He discovered the music of [[Christian rock]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[Larry Norman]] at 13 when Norman played at a religious [[summer camp]] that Thompson attended. Norman's music influenced Thompson to the extent that he named the Pixies' first [[Extended play|EP]] and a lyric in the band's song "Levitate Me" after one of Norman's catchphrases, "[[Come on Pilgrim|come on, pilgrim]]!" Thompson later described the music he listened to during his youth:<ref name="pg4" />

{{cquote|I used to hang out with some misfits. [...] We were the "we listen to odd-ball music" kids. I wasn't hanging out at all-ages shows or trying to get into clubs to see bands, and I was buying records at used [[Record shop|records store]]s and borrowing them from the library. You just saw Emerson, Lake and Palmer records. So I didn't know [punk] music but I started to hear about it in [[high school]]. But it was probably a good thing that I didn't know it, that I instead listened to a lot of '60s records and this [[Contemporary Christian music|religious music]].}}

Just before Thompson's senior year, his family moved to {{city-state|Westport|Massachusetts}}, where he received a ''Teenager of the Year'' award &mdash; the title of a later [[solo album]].<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 5</ref> During this time, Thompson composed several songs that appeared in his later career, including "[[Here Comes Your Man]]" from ''[[Doolittle (album)|Doolittle]]'', and "Velvety Instrumental Version".<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 88</ref>

After graduating from high school in 1983, he studied in the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], majoring in anthropology.<ref name="allmusicpixiesbio">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:z7d2vw9va9ek~T1 | title=allmusic (((Pixies > Biography))) | accessdate=2006-10-27 | author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas | publisher=[[All Music Guide]]}}</ref> Thompson shared a room with another roommate for a [[semester]] before moving in with future Pixies guitarist [[Joey Santiago]].<ref name="pg9">Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 9</ref> The two shared an interest in [[rock music]], and Santiago introduced Thompson to 1970s punk and the music of [[David Bowie]]; they began to jam together.<ref name="officialprofile">{{cite web | url=http://www.4ad.com/pixies/profile/ | title=Pixies Profile | 
author=4AD | accessdate=2006-08-13}}</ref> It was at this time that Thompson discovered [[The Cars]], a band he described as "very influential on me and the Pixies".<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 10</ref> Santiago later recalled his time in college:<ref name="pg9" />

{{cquote|Charles and I had a suite at the college dorm. We'd go to shows, I remember seeing [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and Angst. Initially, I think we just liked each other. I did notice right away that he was playing music. I didn't want any more distractions, but I took my guitar up and we started fooling around with it. He'd write 'em, and I'd throw my ideas on the guitar.}}

In his second year of college, Thompson embarked on a trip to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]] as part of an [[Student exchange program|exchange program]]. He spent six months in an apartment with a "weird, psycho, gay roommate", who later served as a direct inspiration for the Pixies' song "[[Crackity Jones]]";<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 12</ref> many of the band's early songs refer to Thompson's experiences in Puerto Rico. Thompson failed to grasp the [[Spanish language]], and left his studies after debating whether he would go to [[New Zealand]] to view [[Halley's Comet]] (he later said it "seemed like the cool romantic thing to do at the time"),<ref>"No Time Wasters!" Q, No. 48, September 1990</ref> or start a [[rock band]].<ref name="officialprofile" /> He wrote a letter urging Santiago, with the words "we gotta do it, now is the time Joe",<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 12</ref> to join him in a band upon his return to Boston.<ref name="fgpg11">Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 11</ref>

===Pixies===
{{main|Pixies}}
Soon after arriving back in Massachusetts, Thompson dropped out of college, and moved to Boston with Santiago. He spent 1984 working in a warehouse, "managing buttons on teddy bears", composing songs on his [[acoustic guitar]], and writing lyrics on the [[Subway (rail)|subway]] train.<ref name="fgpg11" /> Late in 1985, Thompson formed the Pixies with Santiago.<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 13</ref> Early in 1986, bassist [[Kim Deal]] was recruited via a classified advert placed in a Boston paper, which requested a bassist "into [[H<U+00FC>sker D<U+00FC>]] and [[Peter, Paul and Mary]]". Drummer [[Dave Lovering]] was later hired on recommendation from Deal.<ref name="allmusicpixiesbio" />

In 1987, the Pixies recorded an eighteen-track [[Demo (music)|demo tape]], commonly referred to as ''[[The Purple Tape]]'' amongst fans. Thompson's (natural) father assisted the band financially, loaning $1000 in order to record the demo tape; Thompson later said that his father "wasn't around for a lot of my younger years, so I think he was doing his best to make up for lost time".<ref>Sisario 2006. p. 16</ref> ''The Purple Tape'' lead to a recording contract with the English independent record label [[4AD]].<ref name="officialprofile" /> Thompson adopted the alias "Black Francis" for the release of ''[[Come on Pilgrim]]'', a name inspired by his father: <U+201C>he had been saving that name in case he had another son<U+201D>.<ref>Sisario 2006. p. 18</ref>

In 1988, the Pixies recorded their second album ''[[Surfer Rosa]]''. Francis wrote and sang on all the tracks, with the exception of the single "[[Gigantic (song)|Gigantic]]", which was co-written and sung by Deal. To support the album, the band undertook a European tour, during which Francis met [[Eric Drew Feldman]],<ref>Feldman was a veteran of [[Experimental rock|avant-rock]] bands [[Pere Ubu (band)|Pere Ubu]], [[Captain Beefheart]]'s Magic Band, and [[The Residents]].</ref> a later collaborator on Pixies and solo albums. ''[[Doolittle (album)|Doolittle]]'', with Francis-written songs such as "Debaser" and "Monkey Gone To Heaven",<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596255/monkey_gone_to_heaven | title=Rolling Stone: Monkey Gone to Heaven | accessdate=2006-01-05}}</ref> was released the following year, to widespread critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/nmes_100_best_albums.htm | title=NME's 100 Best Albums - 2003 | accessdate=2006-12-11}}</ref> However, by this time, tensions between Francis and Deal combined with exhaustion, and led the band to announce a hiatus.<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 132</ref> Francis has an aversion to flying, and spent this time driving across America with his girlfriend, Jean Walsh, performing solo shows in order to raise funds to buy furniture in his new [[Los Angeles]] apartment.<ref name="4adpage3">{{cite web | url=http://www.4ad.com/pixies/profile/?page=3 | title=4AD - Pixies - Page 3 | accessdate=2006-11-27 | author=4AD}}</ref>

The band reconvened in 1990, and recorded two further albums: 1990's ''[[Bossanova]]'' and 1991's ''[[Trompe le Monde]]''; the latter was Francis' first collaboration with Feldman. The later Pixies albums were characterized by Francis' increasing influence on the band's output, as well as a focus on [[science fiction themes]], including [[alien]]s and [[UFOs]].<ref>Francis, Black. Lyrics. "[http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=43099 Planet of Sound]." (''[[Trompe le Monde]]''). [[Gramophone record|LP]]. [[4AD Records|4AD]] 1991.</ref> These themes would continue to be explored throughout his early solo work. ''Trompe le Monde'' includes the song "U-Mass", which was written about the university he attended as a youth, and due to the keyboard part played by Feldman, signified a move away from the band's purely alternative rock sound. Although Deal had contributed to previous albums, from ''Bossanova'' on, Francis wrote all the band's original material. This contributed to the increasing tension between Francis and Deal,<ref name="4adpage3" /> and the Pixies broke up in 1992; this was not publicly announced until early in 1993.<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 173</ref>

===Early solo career===
[[Image:Frank black cover.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|''[[Frank Black (album)|Frank Black]]'' (1993)]]
While the Pixies' 1991 album ''Trompe le Monde'' was being recorded, Francis had discussions with the album's producer, [[Gil Norton]], about a possible solo record.<ref>Gil Norton was the producer of the Pixies' records from ''Doolittle'' onwards.</ref> He told Norton he was keen to record again, even though he had no new material; as a result, the two decided on a [[Cover version|cover album]]. However, by the time Francis visited a [[recording studio]] again in 1992, he had "plenty of tunes and musical scraps".<ref name="4adbio">{{cite web | url=http://www.4ad.com/frankblack/profile/ | title=4AD - Frank Black | accessdate=2006-11-29 | author=4AD}}</ref> 

He collaborated with Feldman to record new material; they began by trimming down the number of covers to one, [[The Beach Boys]]' "[[Hang on to Your Ego]]".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/frankblack/albums/album/112901/review/5942903/frank_black | title=Rolling Stone: Frank Black: Frank Black : Music Reviews | accessdate=2006-11-29 | author=Rolling Stone | date=1993-04-01}}</ref> Feldman became the album's producer, and played keyboard and [[bass guitar]] on several songs,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.beefheart.com/datharp/albums/mbmembers/feldman.htm | title=The Captain Beefheart Radar Station - Eric Drew Feldman Discography | accessdate=2006-11-29 | quote=Eric Drew Feldman (bass, keyboards, synthetics)}}</ref> with Santiago featuring on lead guitar.<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 187-8</ref> Francis recorded the album during the hiatus and breakup of the Pixies in late 1992 and early 1993. He then adopted the stage name "Frank Black" (inverting his old persona "Black Francis") and released the results as ''[[Frank Black (album)|Frank Black]]'' in March 1993.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.4ad.com/year/1993/releases/frankblack-0/ | title=4AD - 1993 Releases - Frank Black | accessdate=2007-01-06}}</ref> ''Frank Black'' was characterized by a focus on UFOs and science fiction, although he explored other eclectic subjects, such as in "I Heard Ramona Sing", a song about the [[Ramones]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.4ad.com/frankblack/profile/?page=2 | title=4AD - Frank Black (page 2) | accessdate=2006-12-02 | author=4AD}}</ref> The album was similar in style, both musically and lyrically, to the Pixies' albums ''Bossanova'' and ''Trompe le Monde''. Feldman later said that the first record connected his solo career with ''Trompe le Monde'', "but at the same time it is an island, like nothing else he [Black] did".<ref name="pg188">Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 188</ref>

[[Image:Teenager of the year cover.jpg|thumbnail|left|200px|''[[Teenager of the Year]]'' (1994)]]
The following year, Black released his second solo record, a quirky twenty-two song double album entitled ''[[Teenager of the Year]]''.<ref>Phares, Heather. "[http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,197813,00.html Frank Black: Teenager of the Year]". All Music Guide. Retrieved on [[2006-12-12]].</ref> ''Teenager'' included the song "Headache" ({{audio|FrankBlack-Headache.ogg|sample}}), a moderate success on alternative rock playlists; critics described the song as "irresistible pop".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.guypetersreviews.com/frankblack.php | title=Frank Black Album Reviews | accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref> The production of ''Teenager of the Year'' was markedly different to ''Frank Black''; in the previous album, [[MIDI]] templates were used when writing songs, but in ''Teenager'', Black showed individual parts to band members. Feldman noted that Black's songwriting became "a lot more spontaneous" while recording the album.<ref name="pg188" /> Black had begun to stray from his style with the Pixies, writing songs that covered a variety of genres and topics, and his new-found method of recording was closer to later albums than that of ''Frank Black'' and ''Trompe le Monde''.

Both ''Frank Black'' and ''Teenager of the Year'' were critically well-received and remain fan favorites, although they enjoyed little commercial success. In 1995, Black left his long-time labels [[4AD]] and [[Elektra Records|Elektra]].<ref name="allmusicbio">{{cite web | url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:70qag4attvoz~T1 | title=((( Frank Black > Biography ))) | accessdate=2006-10-23 | author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas}}</ref> Black continued to write new material: 1996 saw the release of ''[[The Cult of Ray]]'' on [[Rick Rubin]]'s [[American Recordings]]; the album marked a turn away from the elaborate production of his first solo works and  was recorded primarily live with few overdubs. His band for this album featured sole ''Teenager'' holdover Lyle Workman on [[lead guitar]], along with bassist David McCaffrey and Scott Boutier on drums.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ubl.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,225711,00.html | title=Frank Black: The Cult of Ray | accessdate=2007-01-02 | author=ArtistDirect}}</ref><ref>Both had previously played in the [[jangle pop]] band [[Miracle Legion]].</ref> Though the album was neither critically nor commercially successful, its stripped-down approach would increasingly define Black's working methods for the next several years.

===Frank Black and the Catholics===
[[Image:Fbcs.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|''[[Frank Black and the Catholics]]'' (1997)]]
Black dubbed this backing band "the Catholics", and the band's eponymous album ''[[Frank Black and the Catholics (album)|Frank Black and the Catholics]]'' was recorded in 1997. Recorded live-to-two-track initially as merely a demo, Black was so pleased with the results that he decided to release the sessions with no further production.<ref name="cathreview">{{cite web | url=http://www.yaleherald.com/archive/xxvi/10.23.98/ae/record3.html | title=Black's first holy communion for post-Pixies fans | accessdate=2006-10-28 | author=McGarry, Daniel | publisher=The Yale Herald}}</ref> The album was delayed for over a year by conflicts at American, both internal and over its production,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://quimby.gnus.org/html/interview/BlackFrank.article.battle.html | title=A Frank Black internet radio show!?!? | accessdate=2006-10-23 | date=1997-08-10 | author=Rutherford, Eric}}</ref> and was ultimately released in late 1998 by [[SpinArt Records]] in the US.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.splendidezine.com/features/frankblack/ | title=Frank Black | accessdate=2006-10-26 | author=Splendid Ezine}}</ref> Since leaving American, Black has avoided long-term contracts with labels, and has maintained ownership of his album masters, licensing each album individually for release.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.splendidezine.com/features/frankblack/ | title=Splendid: Features: Frank Black | accessdate=2006-01-17 | quote=How long have you been able to own your own masters?

All Music Guide}}</ref>

Black would continue to eschew [[multi-track recording]] for the live-to-two-track technique for all subsequent releases under the group name. Live-to-two-track recording precludes the use of overdubs to correct errors or add texture; all takes are recorded continuously, and mixing is done "on the fly". On later albums, Black incorporated more musicians into the sessions to allow for more varied instrumental textures.  Explaining his rationale behind the method, Black commented:<ref name="freew">{{cite web | url=http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/november_2002/frank-black.html | title=Frank Black | accessdate=2006-10-23 | author=Kilian, Dan}}</ref>

{{cquote|Well, it's real. It's a recording of a performance, of a real performance between a group of people, an entourage, a band, as opposed to a facsimile of that, which is frequently what people do with multi-track recording. [...] I prefer it. It's a little more real. It's got a little more heart.}}

By this time, whilst dismissing the possibility of a Pixies reunion, Black had begun to incorporate an increasing number of the band's songs into Catholics concerts, as well as including Santiago in his solo work again.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/concerts/b/black-frank.shtml | title=Frank Black and Catholics - Popmatters Concert Review | accessdate=2006-12-11 | author=Thil, Scott.

A sixth album with the Catholics, ''[[Show Me Your Tears]]'', was released in 2003.  ''Show Me Your Tears<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' title and many of the songs in it were inspired by Black's recent [[divorce]] and entry into [[psychotherapy|therapy]].<ref name="allmusicbio" />

===Pixies reunion, Nashville and beyond===

In late 2003, following long-standing rumours, an official announcement was made that the Pixies were practising for a reunion tour. The band played publicly for the first time in 12 years in April 2004, and went on to tour extensively throughout the U.S, [[Canada]] and Europe in the same year. They also recorded a new Deal-written composition, "[[Bam Thwok]]", which was released on the [[iTunes Music Store]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nme.com/news/pixies/17179 | title=New Pixies Song on iTunes | accessdate=2006-09-03 | author=[[NME]]}}</ref> ''[[Frank Black Francis (album)|Frank Black Francis]]'', a double album bridging the gap between his two personas, was released to coincide with the Pixies reunion tour.

Also in 2004, Black began to collaborate with a group of [[Nashville]] session men, including [[Steve Cropper]], [[Spooner Oldham]], [[Reggie Young]], and [[Anton Fig]], as well as producer [[Jon Tiven]]. In  July 2005, the collective released ''[[Honeycomb (album)|Honeycomb]]'' under the Frank Black name, to  generally favorable reviews. ''Entertainment Weekly'' described the album as "spare, graceful, [and] in the pocket", while ''Billboard'' noted it as "One of his finest hours".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/blackfrank/honeycomb?q=frank%20black | title=Frank Black: Honeycomb (2005): Reviews | accessdate=2006-10-23}}</ref> A second volume of Nashville sessions, a [[double album]] entitled ''[[Fastman Raiderman]]'', was released in June [[2006]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002155416 | title=Frank Black Fashions Double Album | accessdate=2006-11-18 | author=Cohen, Jonathan.

Black continued to tour with the Pixies through 2005 and 2006. Though the Catholics were effectively defunct, March 2006 saw the release on the iTunes Music Store of two separate albums of the band's [[B-side]]s and rarities, ''Snake Oil'' and ''One More Road for the Hit'', with an eye towards a future CD release. Black was also working on more new solo material with [[Eric Drew Feldman]] in the first part of 2006, some of which has already been performed live with Feldman. In the fall of 2006, Black began his first solo tour since 2003.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/Frank_Black_to_launch_fall_tour_with_new_band-10509.html | title=Frank Black Tour Dates: Frank Black to launch fall tour with new band | accessdate=2006-12-06 | author= Madison, Tjames | date=2006-08-08}}</ref> In October 2006, Black announced plans for the Pixies to start rehearsing and recording a new album in January 2007, and to release a solo "[[Greatest hits|Best Of]]" compilation next year.<ref name="nmepixies" /> In December 2006, Black released the internet-only "Christmass" album; a collection of new studio tracks, hotel room sessions, and live acoustic recordings from this tour that previous summer.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2006/12/0624.cfm | title=Frank Black Wishes You A Merry Christmass | accessdate=2006-12-24 | date=2006-12-06 | author=Chartattack.com staff}}</ref>

==Musical style==

:''See also: [[Pixies#Musical style|Pixies' musical style]]'' <!-- Pixies' musical style looks nicer than Pixies#Musical style -->

Over the course of his career, Black's musical style has grown to encompass a large number of genres; however, he is considered to produce rock or alternative rock compositions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:srkqikn6bb69#musvid | title=allmusic ((( Frank Black > Overview ))) | accessdate=2006-12-13 | author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. | publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref> Whereas songs such as "Here Comes Your Man" (''Doolittle''), "Velvety" (''Devil's Workshop'') and "Headache" (''Teenager of the Year'') expose a more [[Soft rock|light rock]] side, others such as "Something Against You" (''Surfer Rosa'') and "Thalassocracy" (''Teenager of the Year'') hint to a more [[Hard rock|heavy rock]] influence in his material. A strong [[country music]] influence is also increasingly evident in his style, most notably in his Nashville albums, ''Honeycomb'' and ''Fastman Raiderman''.

Black acquired his trademark screaming as a teenager, when, according to Black, a Thai neighbor asked him to sing "[[Oh! Darling]]" by [[The Beatles]] (from their album ''[[Abbey Road (album)|Abbey Road]]'') and to "Scream it like you hate that bitch!"<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 6</ref> Black's powerful screams were a signature of Pixies albums, along with the band's typical song structure of quietly paced [[verse]]s followed by thundering [[refrain|chorus]] lines and repetitive guitar [[staccato]].<ref name="allmusicpixiesbio" />

===Influences===
Black has drawn influence from a number of [[Music genre|musical genres]]. As a teenager, Black mostly listened to 1960's folk and religious music, including the [[Christian]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[Larry Norman]]. Later in high school and in college, he discovered [[Punk rock|punk music]] ([[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]), along with bands from other genres, such as the [[New Wave music|new wave]] band [[The Cars]]. While in Boston in 1984, before starting the Pixies, Black listened to [[H<U+00FC>sker D<U+00FC>]]'s ''[[Zen Arcade]]'', ''[[Spotlight Kid]]'' by [[Captain Beefheart]], and ''I'm Sick of You'', an [[Iggy Pop]] bootleg.<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 11</ref> His choice of covers in his career reveals many influences, with songs such as [[The Beatles]]' "[[Wild Honey Pie]]" (from''[[The Beatles (album)|The White Album]]'') and "Head On" (by [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]]) with the Pixies, and [[The Beach Boys]]' "[[Hang On To Your Ego]]" in his solo career.

Other media has influenced Black. References to the Bible, especially in his career with the Pixies, appear in his work; most notably in the [[incest]]uous tale of "[[Nimrod (king)|Nimrod]]'s Son", the stories of [[Uriah the Hittite|Uriah]], [[Bathsheba]] in "Dead", [[Samson]] in "Gouge Away" and references to the [[The Tower of Babel]] in songs such as "Build High" and "Old Black Dawning".<ref name="bcinterview">{{cite web | url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2002/09/09/202154.php | title=The Blogcritics Frank Black Interview Is Here! | accessdate=2006-12-15 | author=Olsen, Eric | date=2002-09-09}}</ref> He cited surrealist films [[Eraserhead]] and [[Un Chien Andalou]] (as mentioned in "Debaser") as major influences on his work with the Pixies; however, Surrealism was less of an influence in his solo career.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dag.wieers.com/debaser/lyrics/Debaser.php | title=Pixies - Debaser | accessdate=2006-10-01}}</ref> He commented on these influences (which he paid tribute to most in the Pixies' ''Doolittle''), saying he "didn't have the patience to sit around reading Surrealist novels", but found it easier to watch twenty-minute films.<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 29</ref>


===Songwriting and lyrics===
During his stay in Puerto Rico, Black acquired a fairly fluent, although informal and at times incorrect, use of [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]], which he has continued throughout his career. Several early Pixies songs, including "Isla de Encanta" and "Vamos", reference his experiences in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], and the lyrics are often heavily seasoned with the island's [[slang]]. The island's influence in his work is most notable in the song "Isla De Encanta", named after the island's [[motto]], "Isla Del Encanto". Other Pixies songs drawn from his experiences there include "Vamos" (''[[Come on Pilgrim]]''), "Oh My Golly!", "[[Where Is My Mind?]]" (''[[Surfer Rosa]]'') and the B-side "Bailey's Walk". Several of his songs contain Spanish lyrics, most notably in the Pixies' first album, ''Come On Pilgrim'', and a Spanish translation of "Evil Hearted You" by [[The Yardbirds]].<ref>Francis, Black. Lyrics. "[http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=70947 Evil Hearted You (Corazon De Diablo)]".</ref> From his later works with the Pixies onwards, his use of Spanish drifted westward, reflecting places and aspects of the state of [[California]] and its culture.<ref name="freew" />

Black's lyrics are noted for their obscure references to off-beat topics such as [[outer space]], [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]s, and [[The Three Stooges]] &mdash; the last of these being the subject of "Two Reelers", a song from ''Teenager of the Year''.<ref name="pg188" /> Lyrics with a focus on science fiction were particularly prominent on the later Pixies records, as well as his early solo albums.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/04.25.96/frank-black-9617.html | title=Metroactive Music > Frank Black | accessdate=2006-12-15 | author=Baxter, Nicky | date=1996-04-25}}</ref> With the Catholics, his lyrics have tended towards historical topics; for example, the song "St. Francis Dam Disaster" (from ''Dog in the Sand'') is about the catastrophic collapse of the [[St. Francis Dam]] near Los Angeles in March [[1928]],<ref name="bcinterview" /> and the ''All My Ghosts'' [[EP]] featured an account of the "Humboldt County Massacre" of [[Wiyot]] Indians in [[1860]] near [[Eureka, California]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.frankblack.net/songs/db.asp?mode=release-song-details&releaseID=749&songID=136 | title=FrankBlack.Net Discopedia - Humboldt County Massacre | accessdate=2007-01-10}}</ref>

[[Image:PixiesLetterman2005.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Black performing "[[Monkey Gone to Heaven]]" as part of the Pixies on the [[Late Show with David Letterman]] in 2005]]
Black has appeared on a range of television shows solo and as part of the Pixies, ranging from ''[[120 Minutes]]'' and ''[[The Late Show]]'' in the US, to ''[[The Word]]'' in the UK.<ref name="pixiesvideos">{{cite web | url=http://www.broszkowski.com/tv/pixies/pixiesvideodownload.html | title=Download Obscure Pixies TV appearances | accessdate=2006-11-06 | author=Broszkowski, Matthew}}</ref>

As part of the Pixies, he was reluctant to film music videos for singles. [[Elektra Records]]' Peter Lubin commented that "to get videos out of them was a major [...] undertaking and it only got worse over time", citing the fact that Black refused to [[lip-sync]] to [[music videos]];<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 140</ref> the video for the Pixies' "[[Here Comes Your Man]]" features Black and Deal opening their mouths as the vocals are being heard, mocking the practice.

In his early solo career as Frank Black, his videos were more professional; he became more willing to take part in them. "Los Angeles" is an example; the video features Black riding across a desert on a [[hovercraft]]. [[They Might Be Giants]]' [[John Flansburgh]], who helped produce the "Los Angeles" video, later commented on the change in Black's attitude to music videos:<ref name="pg188" />

{{cquote|I think the Pixies had made enough anti-videos that Charles was ready to do things that were more visually hopped up. The "Los Angeles" video that we did, the last minute and a half of the song is this open field of grey over which hovercrafts are floating. It's about as tripped up as any video I've ever been involved in, and it was also realizing a dream of Charles', getting him in a hovercraft.}}

Black has only released one music video since leaving 4AD, a low-budget video in Germany for ''Dog in the Sand''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s "Robert Onion". The last widely-released video produced for Black's solo material was for "Headache", from ''Teenager of the Year''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.musictoday.com/interact/chat/fblack.asp | title=Musictoday - Frank Black online chat | accessdate=2007-01-10}}</ref><!-- A more reliable source would be better -->
