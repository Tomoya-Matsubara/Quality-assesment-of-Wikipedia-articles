'''M-28 Business Route''' ('''BUS M-28''') is a [[Michigan highway system|state trunkline highway]] serving as a [[business route]] that runs for {{convert|4.841|mi|km|3}} through the downtown districts of [[Ishpeming, Michigan|Ishpeming]] and [[Negaunee, Michigan|Negaunee]] in [[Michigan]]. The trunkline provides a marked route for traffic diverting from [[U.S. Route 41 in Michigan|U.S. Highway 41]] (US&nbsp;41) and [[M-28 (Michigan highway)|M-28]] through the two historic iron-mining communities. It is one of three business loops for M-numbered highways in the state of Michigan. There have previously been two other BUS&nbsp;M-28 designations for routes in [[Newberry, Michigan|Newberry]] and [[Marquette, Michigan|Marquette]].

The trunkline was originally a section of US&nbsp;41/M-28 and [[M-35 (Michigan highway)|M-35]]. Before the 1930s, the main highways ran through the two downtown areas. US&nbsp;41/M-28 was relocated to run near Teal Lake. The former routing had various names over the years. It was designated as an [[alternate route]] of the main highways, using both the '''US&nbsp;41A/M-28A''' and '''ALT&nbsp;US&nbsp;41/ALT&nbsp;M-28''' designations before it was designated as BUS&nbsp;M-28 in 1958. M-35 continued to run through downtown Negaunee along a section of the highway until the 1960s. A rerouting in 1999 moved the trunkline designation along Lakeshore Drive in Ishpeming, and a streetscape project rebuilt the road in Negaunee in 2005.

==Route description==
There are currently three business routes in the state of Michigan derived from M-numbered highways. The other two are in [[Hillman, Michigan|Hillman]] and [[Niles, Michigan|Niles]] for [[M-32 (Michigan highway)|M-32]] and [[M-60 (Michigan highway)|M-60]] respectively.<ref name="MDOT07">{{cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Official 2007 Department of Transportation Map |year=2007 }}</ref> In the past, two other business routes for M-28 existed in Newberry and Marquette, but they have since been retired. The extant BUS&nbsp;M-28 designation remains for the loop through Ishpeming and Negaunee.

===Ishpeming===
BUS&nbsp;M-28 begins at a [[traffic signal|signalized]] intersection on US&nbsp;41/M-28 with Lakeshore Drive in the city of Ishpeming. The trunkline runs south along Lakeshore Drive under the tracks of the [[Lake Superior and Ishpeming Railroad]] (LS&I) and southeasterly towards Lake Bancroft. South of the lake, BUS&nbsp;M-28 turns east on Division Street.<ref name="googleBR"/> Traffic along the highway here can view the towers of the [[Cliffs Shaft Mine Museum]]; the museum is dedicated to telling the story of underground [[iron ore]] mining in the region.<ref name="huntsCSM">{{cite book |author=Hunt, Mary and Hunt, Don |chapter=Ishpeming <U+2014> Cliffs Shaft Mining Museum |year=2007 |title=Hunt's Guide to Michigan's Upper Peninsula |publisher= Midwestern Guides |location=[[Albion, MI]] |url=http://hunts-upguide.com/ |chapterurl=http://hunts-upguide.com/ishpeming_cliffs_shaft_mining_museum.html |accessdate=June 18, 2009}}</ref><ref name="MJCSM">{{cite news |url=http://www.miningjournal.net/page/content.detail/id/509403.html?nav=5073 |title=Cliff<U+2019>s Shaft Mining Museum <U+2014> Remnants of history |publisher=The Marquette ''Mining Journal'' |date=May 2, 2008 |accessdate=June 18, 2009}}</ref>
[[File:Cliffs Shaft Mine tower.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Tower of the Cliffs Shaft Mine in Ishpeming|alt=A large grey building, wider at the top that towers over the pine trees in the foreground]]
Division Street carries the BUS&nbsp;M-28 designation into the [[central business district]] of Ishpeming, where it runs past local businesses, Ishpeming High School and the original [[Ishpeming Municipal Building|Ishpeming City Hall]]. On the east side of downtown, both the central machine shops and the research labs for [[Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company]] are located on Division Street. Continuing east, the trunkline follows Ready Street over hills and through a residential area to the Ishpeming<U+2013>Negaunee city line.<ref name="googleBR"/>

===Negaunee===
[[Image:Negaunee City Hall.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Negaunee City Hall is located on the corner of Silver and Jackson streets, next to BUS&nbsp;M-28|alt=A large sandstone building with a central clock tower]]
In Negaunee, the routing uses a street named County Road east from the city line. County Road passes Jackson Park, location of the first iron ore discovery in the area. The iron mined from the region supplied half of the nation's supply between 1850 and 1900.<ref name="huntsN">{{cite book |author=Hunt, Mary and Hunt, Don |chapter=Negaunee |year=2007 |title=Hunt's Guide to Michigan's Upper Peninsula |publisher= Midwestern Guides |location=[[Albion, MI]] |url=http://hunts-upguide.com/ |chapterurl=http://hunts-upguide.com/negaunee.html |accessdate=June 18, 2009}}</ref> South of downtown Negaunee, BUS&nbsp;M-28 turns north along the west fork of Silver Street. The street runs north under an overpass that carries Rail Street, so named because it was once a rail line into downtown Negaunee. The trunkline turns east on Jackson Street, running next to the Negaunee City Hall,<ref name="googleBR"/> which was built in 1914<U+2013>15 at a time when the city's population was increasing and iron production was peaking. The building still houses the city's offices, police station and library.<ref name="huntsDN">{{cite book |author=Hunt, Mary and Hunt, Don |chapter=Downtown Negaunee |year=2007 |title=Hunt's Guide to Michigan's Upper Peninsula |publisher= Midwestern Guides |location=[[Albion, MI]] |url=http://hunts-upguide.com/ |chapterurl=http://hunts-upguide.com/negaunee_downtown_negaunee.html |accessdate=June 18, 2009}}</ref>

The business loop follows Jackson Street east to Division Street, where the street curves slightly and becomes Main Street. BUS&nbsp;M-28 follows Main Street one block to the intersection with Teal Lake Avenue. Turning north, the trunkline follows Teal Lake Avenue through residential areas of town past the Negaunee Middle School and up over a hill. On the opposite side of the hill next to Teal Lake Bluff, the business loop intersects Arch Street, which carries traffic to Negaunee High School to the west or the football field complex to the east.<ref name="googleBR"/> Negaunee High School was the site of the former Mather B Mine Complex. The administration building for the mine was converted to its present educational use in 1986.<ref name="NPS">{{cite web |url=http://www.negaunee.k12.mi.us/district/district-information/facilities |title=Facilities |publisher=[[Negaunee Public Schools]] |accessdate=January 16, 2010}}</ref>BUS&nbsp;M-28 continues along Teal Lake Avenue past the football field and under the LS&I tracks where it ends at another signalized intersection with US&nbsp;41/M-28 by Teal Lake.<ref name="googleBR"/> The total length of BUS&nbsp;M-28 is {{convert|4.841|mi|km|3}}.<ref name="PRF"/>

===Traffic counts===
The [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] (MDOT) publishes the [[annual average daily traffic]] (AADT) for its roadways on a yearly basis. AADT is a statistic used in [[transportation planning]] used to express the average number of vehicles on a segment of roadway on any given day of the year. On Lakeshore Drive in Ishpeming, MDOT stated that 6,300&nbsp;vehicles used the roadway daily in 2006. Along Division Street, traffic drops to 3,700&nbsp;vehicles before dropping further to 3,300&nbsp;vehicles along the section on County Road in Negaunee. Silver Street had the lowest traffic counts at 1,700&nbsp;vehicles on an average day. Traffic is heaviest along Teal Lake Avenue, at 7,800&nbsp;vehicles.<ref name="adtIsh">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |url=http://mdotwas1.mdot.state.mi.us/public/maps_adtmaparchive/2006adt/Ishpeming%20Negaunee.pdf |format=PDF|title=ADT Map for Ishpeming<U+2013>Negaunee |year=2006 |accessdate=March 24, 2008}}</ref>

==History==
BUS&nbsp;M-28 was originally a portion of US&nbsp;41/M-28 before the construction of the northerly bypass of Ishpeming and Negaunee in 1937.<ref name="MSHD37-5">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Michigan Highway Map |edition=Summer |date=May 15, 1937 |section=B5}}</ref><ref name="MSHD37-12">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Michigan Highway Map |edition=1937/8 Winter |date=December 1, 1937 |section=B5}}</ref> The business loop was not designated BUS&nbsp;M-28 permanently until 1958.<ref name="MSHD58">{{cite map |publisher=[[Michigan Department of Transportation|Michigan State Highway Department]] |title=Official Michigan Highway Map |year=1958 |section=C5}}</ref> It was designated US&nbsp;41A/M-28A<ref name="MCRC39">{{cite map |publisher=Marquette County Road Commission |title=Marquette County |year=1939}}</ref><ref name="MCRC50">{{cite map |publisher=Marquette County Road Commission |title=Marquette County |year=1950}}</ref> before being redesignated ALT&nbsp;US 41/ALT&nbsp;M-28.<ref name="MDOT51">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=City of Ishpeming Act 51 Map |year=1951}}</ref> This dual designation mirrored the other Marquette County business route, BUS&nbsp;US&nbsp;41.<ref name="MDOT75">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Official Transportation Map |year=1975 |inset=Marquette}}</ref>

When M-35 was routed through downtown Negaunee, it joined BUS&nbsp;M-28 northward from the east fork of Silver Street on to US&nbsp;41/M-28. This routing was moved to bypass the city in 1964 when iron ore mining activity destabilized a portion of the M-35 routing southeast of town.<ref name="ROWMC">Right of Way for the M-35 Relocation was purchased between March 20, 1964 and October 12, 1964 according to {{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |url=http://mdotwas1.mdot.state.mi.us/public/ROWFiles/results.cfm?Dir=Marquette |title=Right Of Way Maps for Marquette County |accessdate=March 8, 2008 |date= |inset=Sheets 73<U+2013>76}}</ref> From this point on, BUS&nbsp;M-28 has has not shared its routing with any other state trunklines. The western end of BUS&nbsp;M-28 was rerouted on June 4, 1999,<ref name="MSABR">{{cite web | author= | title=State Administrative Board Resolutions | date=1940-present | work=State of Michigan | url= http://www.michigan.gov/documents/resolution_list_155716_7.pdf | accessdate=February 13, 2008 |format=PDF}}</ref> when the City of Ishpeming petitioned MDOT to reroute the highway along Lakeshore Drive to US&nbsp;41/M-28. Previously, it ran along Greenwood Street and North Lake Road and met US&nbsp;41/M-28 in the [[West Ishpeming, Michigan|West Ishpeming]] neighborhood of [[Ishpeming Township, Michigan|Ishpeming Township]].<ref name="MSABR"/>

MDOT in a partnership with the City of Negaunee upgraded Teal Lake Avenue between Arch and Rock streets in a streetscaping project to provide a "pedestrian refuge area". This work entailed reconstruction of the retaining wall, curbing and gutters in 2005. Arch Street is the access to Negaunee High School, and this section of BUS&nbsp;M-28 is near the athletic field complex in Negaunee. The project budgeted $120,200 with $24,200 from the City of Negaunee (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|120200|2005|r=-2}}}} and ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|24200|2005|r=-2}}}} respectively in {{CURRENTYEAR}}).<ref name="MDOTSC">{{cite web |title=FY&nbsp;2005 Awarded Enhancement Project Summaries |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/County_Descriptions_119363_7.pdf | date=March 16, 2005 |accessdate=March 18, 2008 |format=PDF |page=3}}</ref><ref name="inflation-US">{{cite web |url= http://www.minneapolisfed.org/community_education/teacher/calc/hist1800.cfm |title=Consumer Price Index Estimate |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis |accessdate=May 22, 2009}}</ref>
