[[Lieutenant (Star Trek)|Lieutenant]] '''Natasha "Tasha" Yar''' is a [[fictional character]] who mainly appeared in the [[Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 1)|first season]] of the American [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. Portrayed by [[Denise Crosby]], she is Chief of Security aboard the [[Starfleet]] starship [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise''-D]]. The concept of the character was originally based upon the character Vasquez from the 1986 film ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''. Following further development she became known first as Tanya, and then Tasha. Crosby had originally auditioned for the role of [[Deanna Troi]], while [[Rosalind Chao]] became a favourite for Tasha. After [[Marina Sirtis]] auditioned for the role of Tasha, the show's creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] decided to switch the roles for the actresses, with Sirtis becoming Troi and Crosby becoming Tasha.

The character first appeared in the pilot episode of the season, "[[Encounter at Farpoint]]". After Crosby decided to leave the show, Yar was killed by the creature Armus in "[[Skin of Evil]]", the 23rd episode of the season. She was written back into the show for the [[Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 3)|third season]] episode "[[Yesterday's Enterprise]]" in which the timeline was changed so that she didn't die, and again in the final episode of the series "[[All Good Things...]]" in events set prior to the pilot.

She was described as a forerunner to other strong women in science fiction such as [[Kara Thrace]] from the 2004 version of ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' while providing a step between the appearances of female characters in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]'' to the command positions they have in ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager|Voyager]]''. Questions were raised over the sexuality of the character, with the events in the episode "[[The Naked Now]]" thought to have happened in order to establish her heterosexuality. The manner of her first death was received with mixed reviews, with one critic saying it was typical of the death of a ''Star Trek'' security officer, while it was also included in a list of "naff" sci-fi deaths.

==Appearances==
Natasha Yar's origins are explained in the season four episode "[[Legacy (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Legacy]]". She was born on the planet Turkana IV in 2337. She had a younger sister named [[Ishara Yar|Ishara]] ([[Beth Toussaint]]), who was born five years after her. Shortly after Ishara's birth, both their parents were killed and they were taken in by other people. However, they were subsequently abandoned and Tasha was required to look after her sister on her own.<ref name=legacy>{{cite episode |title=Legacy|episodelink=Legacy (Star Trek: The Next Generation) |series=Star Trek: The Next Generation |first1=Joe|last1=Menosky|season = 4|number =6 |date=October 29, 1990}}</ref> The government on the planet had collapsed, and the sisters were forced to scavenge for food while avoiding rape gangs.<ref name=wherenoone>{{cite episode |title=Where No One Has Gone Before|episodelink=Where No One Has Gone Before |series=Star Trek: The Next Generation |first1=Diane|last1=Duane|first2=Michael|last2=Reaves|season = 1|number =6 |date=October 26, 1987}}</ref> In 2352, Tasha managed to leave Turkana IV at the age of 15.

Yar appeared for the first time in the pilot episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' as the Security and Tactical Officer on board the USS ''Enterprise''-D. When [[Captain Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]) orders an emergency saucer separation, Yar is one of the bridge crew to accompany him to the [[battle bridge]]. She is amongst the crew abducted by [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] ([[John de Lancie]]), and later serves on the away team to Farpoint Station.<ref name=encatfarpoint>{{cite episode |title=Encounter at Farpoint|episodelink=Encounter at Farpoint |series=Star Trek: The Next Generation |first1=D.

After the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-C)|USS ''Enterprise''-C]] emerges from a rift in space-time in "Yesterday's Enterprise", the timeline is changed and Yar is once again alive and in her former position on the ''Enterprise''-D. She works with the older Enterprise's helmsman, [[Richard Castillo]] ([[Christopher McDonald]]), and the two become close. [[Guinan (Star Trek character)|Guinan]]'s ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]) confides in Yar that she belives that Yar died senselessly in the timeline that would be restored by the ''Enterprise''-C returning into the rift. Based on that advice, Yar transfers to the ''Enterprise''-C and returns with it to two decades into the past, and its expected destruction at the hands of the [[Romulans]] while defending the [[Klingon]] outpost Narendra III.<ref name=yesterdaysenterprise>{{cite episode |title=Yesterday's Enterprise|episodelink=Yesterday's Enterprise |series=Star Trek: The Next Generation |first1=Ira Steven|last1=Behr|first2=Richard|last2=Manning|first3=Hans|last3=Beimler|first4=Ronald D.|last4=Moore|first5=Trent Christopher|last5=Ganino|first6=Eric A.|last6=Stillwell|season = 3|number =15|date=February 19, 1990}}</ref> The alternative universe version of Yar travelled back in time onboard the ''Enterprise''-C, and into the main timeline. This process was later described as "world jumping" rather than a typical timeline travel story by critics.<ref>[[#hanley1997|Hanley (1997)]]: p. 213</ref>

It is explained by her half Romulan daughter Sela in "Redemption" that several members of the ''Enterprise''-C crew were captured by the Romulans when it returned through the rift, including Yar. A Romulan General offered to spare the crew from executions if she became his consort. After a year, Yar gave birth to Sela. When Sela was four, Yar attempted to escape but Sela screamed to prevent her from being taken away from her father which subsequently resulted in Yar's execution.<ref name=redemption>{{cite episode |title=Redemption (Part II)|episodelink=Redemption (Star Trek: The Next Generation) |series=Star Trek: The Next Generation |first1=Ronald D.|last1=Moore|season = 5|number =1|date=September 23, 1991}}</ref>

The final appearance of Yar is in the series finale "[[All Good Things...]]", in scenes which take prior to and in the early parts of "Encounter at Farpoint". As most of the bridge crew are yet to join the ''Enterprise''-D in the scenes, Yar is one of the senior members of the crew under Captain Picard in the earliest of the three timeframes in the episode. She needs to be convinced by Picard to put the ship in danger in order to destroy the temporal anomaly that threatens to prevent life from evolving on Earth.<ref name=allgoodthings>{{cite episode |title=All Good Things&nbsp;... |episodelink=All Good Things... |series=Star Trek: The Next Generation |first1=Brannon|last2=Braga|first2=Ronald D.|last2=Moore|season = 7|number = 25/26|date=May 23, 1994}}</ref>

==Reception==
{{Quote box
 |quote = The loss of Yar is unfortunate. While it's true the character as portrayed didn't live up to the character as envisioned <U+2014> Yar was the most interesting person in the TNG bible <U+2014> that's also true of a lot of characters. Denise Crosby has never been the best actor in the universe, but Michael Dorn, Jonathan Frakes, and Marina Sirtis weren't any great shakes in the first season, either, and their characters didn't blow the doors off. They got better with time, and there's every reason to believe the same would've been true for Crosby had she remained.

In Sarah Projansky's contribution on rape in ''Star Trek'' to the book ''Enterprise Zones: Critical Positions on Star Trek'', she extrapolates that Yar's introduction to [[Starfleet]] was similar to the actions of [[United States Army]] soldiers issuing supplies to the survivors of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and the liberation of [[Nazi concentration camps]] during the Second World War.<ref name=positions>{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=Taylor|coauthor=Projanksy, Sarah; Ono, Kent A.; Helford, Elyce Rae|title=Enterprise Zones: Critical Positions on Star Trek|year=1996|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder, CO|isbn=978-0-8133-2898-0|pages=33<U+2013>34|url=http://www.questia.com/read/87093041/enterprise-zones-critical-positions-on-star-trek}} {{Subscription required}}</ref> The idea of an American saviour of colonial rape victims stems from U.S. propaganda during the war, stating that "In ''TNG'', the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] citizen represents a new and improved version of this U.S. savior citizen; the Federation citizen is a post-nationalist, post-sexist, and post-racist soldier <U+2013> feminist".<ref name=positions/>
