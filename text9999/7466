The '''Greek underworld''' was made up of various realms believed to lie beneath the earth or at its farthest reaches.

This includes:
* The great pit of [[Tartarus]], originally the exclusive prison of the old [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] gods, it later came to be the dungeon home of damned souls.
* The land of the dead ruled by the god [[Hades]], which is variously called the house or domain of Hades ({{lang|grc|<U+03B4><U+03CC><U+03BC><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+1F0C><U+03CA><U+03B4><U+03BF><U+03C2>}}, ''domos A<U+00EF>dos''),<ref>As at ''[[Iliad]]'' 3.322, for example.</ref> Hades, [[Erebus]], the [[Asphodel Meadows]] (where the neutral souls are sent), [[Styx|Stygia]] and [[Acheron]].
* The Isles of the Blessed or [[Fortunate Isles|Elysian Fields]] ruled by [[Cronus]] (According to [[Pindar]] in his descriptions), where the great heroes of myth resided after death.
* The [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]] ruled by [[Rhadamanthys]], where the virtuous dead and initiates in the ancient Mysteries were sent to dwell.

The five rivers of Hades are [[Acheron]] (the river of sorrow), [[Cocytus]] (the river of lamentation), [[Phlegethon]] (the river of fire), [[Lethe]] (the river of forgetfulness) and [[Styx]] (the river of hate), which forms the boundary between upper and lower worlds.

The ancient Greek concept of the underworld evolved considerably over time.

==The Homeric underworld==
{{Greek myth (Hades)}}
{{further2|[[Hades]]}}
The underworld is ruled by Hades.
The oldest descriptions of the underworld can be found in Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''. The other poets of old epics such as [[Hesiod]] describe it similarly. In the ''Odyssey'', the underworld is located beyond the Western horizon. [[Odysseus]], instructed by sorceress [[Circe]] to cross the [[Ocean]]<ref>
Homer's Odyssey [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=B827C3204A35EB73B18F02A407A340A6?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D10%3Acard%3D503 10.503]</ref> and assisted by the [[North Wind]], reaches the underworld by ship from Circe's island.<ref>Homer. the ''Iliad''.Trans. Lombardo, Stanley. Indianapolis, USA: Hackett, 2000.</ref> Later on, the ghosts of the suitors who have died are herded there by [[Hermes#Other|Hermes Psychopompus]], the guide of the dead. He herds them through the hollows of the earth, beyond the earth-encircling river Oceanus and the gates of the (setting) Sun to their final resting place in Hades.

==The Ferryman==
<!--Charon's obol was NOT placed on the eyes; please follow link to the article-->
The deceased entered the underworld by crossing the River Acheron or Styx ferried across by [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] (''kair'-on''), who charged a ''[[drachma]]'', a small coin, as a fee. [[Charon's obol]] was placed in the mouth or on the eyes of the dead person, a custom described in Greek and Roman literature and confirmed by archaeology, although only a relatively small number of Greek burials contain the coin. The far side of the river was guarded by [[Cerberus]], the three-headed guard dog of Hades.

==Myths featuring the Underworld==

The twelfth and last task of [[Heracles]] was to retrieve [[Cerberus]] from his post and bring him to [[Eurystheus]].

The [[Argonauts|Argonaut]] [[Orpheus]], a wonderful musician, lost his soon-to-be wife [[Eurydice]] after she was bitten by a snake. He descended to the Underworld and managed to pass Cerberus and Charon by charming them with his [[kithara]] (a musical instrument similar to a [[lyre]]) to plead [[Hades]] and [[Persephone]]. Persephone felt sorry for him, so he was allowed to have her back, if he reached the living world again without looking over his shoulder. At the last minute because he was unable to hear his wife's footsteps, he turned back. In doing so, he caught his last glimpse of his wife's ghost as she faded back into the Underworld.
