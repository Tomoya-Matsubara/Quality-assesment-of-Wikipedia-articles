==The building==
The basilica is located at the summit of the ''butte [[Montmartre]]'' (Montmartre butte), the highest point in the city.

The original idea of constructing a church dedicated to the Sacred Heart developed in France after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] ([[1870]]). Architect [[Paul Abadie]] designed the basilica after winning a competition over 77 other architects, but he died not long after the foundation had been laid, in [[1884]], and other architects continued with the work. The overall style of the structure shows heavy Romano-Byzantine influence.  Many design elements of the basilica are based on  nationalistic themes: the portico, with its three arches, is adorned by two equestrian statues of French national saints [[Joan of Arc]] and [[Louis IX of France|King Saint Louis IX]], both executed in bronze by Lefebvre; and the nineteen-ton ''Savoyarde'' bell (one of the world's heaviest), cast in [[1895]] in [[Annecy]], alludes to the annexation of [[Savoy]] in [[1860]].

Construction costs (amounting to some 40 million French francs) were originally funded by a national subscription in [[1873]], but the state ultimately assumed responsibility for funding. Construction began in [[1875]] and was completed in [[1914]], although consecration of the basilica was delayed until after the [[First World War]].

Sacr<U+00E9>-C<U+0153>ur is built of [[travertine]] stone quarried in [[Chateau-Landon|Ch<U+00E2>teau-Landon]] ([[Seine-et-Marne]]), [[France]]. This stone constantly exudes [[calcite]], which ensures that the basilica remains white even with weathering and pollution.

A mosaic in the apse, entitled ''Christ in Majesty,'' is among the world's largest.

The basilica complex includes a garden for meditation, with a fountain. The top of the dome is open to tourists and affords a spectacular panoramic view of the city of [[Paris]], which is mostly to the south of the basilica.

==Role in Catholicism== 

In response to requests from French bishops, [[Pope Pius IX]] promulgated the doctrine of the [[Sacred Heart]] in [[1856]]. The basilica itself was consecrated on [[October 16]], [[1919]]. 

Since [[1885]] (before construction had been completed), the [[Blessed Sacrament]] (a consecrated host which has been [[transubstantiation|turned into the Body and Blood]] of [[Jesus Christ]] during [[Holy Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]) has been continually on display in a [[monstrance]] above the high [[altar]]. [[Eucharistic adoration|Perpetual adoration]] of the Blessed Sacrament has continued uninterrupted in the Basilica since [[1885]].

==In popular culture==

The area before the basilica has featured in many films, notably in [[2001 in film|2001 film]] ''[[Am<U+00E9>lie]]'' ''(Le fabuleux destin d'Am<U+00E9>lie Poulain).''

The basilica can also be seen in the window in background of the Audrey Hepburn film "Sabrina" while she is writing home to her father before returning home to America.

In the anime series ''[[Noir_(TV_series)|Noir]]'', the lead character Mireille Bouquet has a rendez-vous with Remi Breffort, a high profile member of the secret organization ''Les Soldats'', inside the basilica.
