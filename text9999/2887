[[image:parliament2.jpg|thumb|175px|right|The Chamber of the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]]]]'''[[Canadian Parliament]]s''' are the [[legislature|legislative bodies]] of the [[Federation|federal]] Government of [[Canada]]. They are composed of the [[Canadian House of Commons]] (lower house), the [[Canadian Senate]] (upper house), and the Sovereign, represented by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]].  Most major legislation originates from the House, as it is the only body that is directly elected.  A new parliament begins after an [[Elections in Canada|election]] of the House of Commons and can sit for up to five years.  The number of seats in parliament has varied as new provinces joined the country and as population distribution between the provinces changed; there are currently 308 MPs and 105 Senators (when there are no vacancies).  The leader of the [[political party|party]] with the most seats in the House of Commons becomes [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]], even if he or she is not an elected member of parliament.  The leader of the party with the second-most seats in the House becomes the [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]], and debate between the parties is presided over by the [[Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons|Speaker of the House]].  When the party with the most seats has less than half of the total number of seats, it forms a [[minority government]], which can be voted out of power by the other parties.  The Canadian Parliament is located at [[Parliament Hill]] in the capital city, [[Ottawa]]. The current assembly is the [[39th Canadian parliament]] since the [[Canadian Confederation|confederation]] of Canada in [[1867]].
