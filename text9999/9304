'''Plutonium''' is a [[transuranium element|transuranic]] [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[chemical element]] with the [[chemical symbol|symbol]]&nbsp;'''Pu''' and [[atomic number]]&nbsp;94. It is an [[actinide]] [[metal]] of silvery-gray appearance that [[tarnish]]es when exposed to air, and forms a dull coating when [[plutonium(IV) oxide|oxidized]]. The element normally exhibits six [[allotrope]]s and four [[oxidation state]]s. It reacts with [[carbon]], [[halogen]]s, [[nitrogen]], [[silicon]] and [[hydrogen]]. When exposed to moist air, it forms [[oxide]]s and [[hydride]]s that expand the sample up to 70% in volume, which in turn flake off as a powder that can [[pyrophoricity|spontaneously ignite]]. It is [[radiation poisoning|radioactive]] and can accumulate in the [[bone]]s. These properties make the handling of plutonium dangerous.

Plutonium is the heaviest [[primordial element]] by virtue of its most stable [[isotopes of plutonium|isotope]], [[plutonium-244]], whose [[half-life]] of about 80&nbsp;million years is just long enough for the element to be found in trace quantities in nature.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1038/234132a0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v234/n5325/abs/234132a0.html|title= Detection of Plutonium-244 in Nature|journal = Nature|pages = 132<U+2013>134|year = 1971|last1 = Hoffman|first1 = D.

M.|volume = 234|bibcode = 1971Natur.234..132H|issue=5325}}</ref> Plutonium is mostly a byproduct of [[nuclear reactions]] in reactors where some of the [[neutron]]s released by the [[nuclear fission|fission]] process convert uranium-238 nuclei into plutonium.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/world/asia/29japan.html "Contaminated Water Escaping Nuclear Plant, Japanese Regulator Warns"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>

Both [[plutonium-239]] and [[plutonium-241]] are [[fissile]], meaning that they can sustain a [[nuclear chain reaction]], leading to applications in [[nuclear weapon]]s and [[nuclear reactor]]s. [[Plutonium-240]] exhibits a high rate of [[spontaneous fission]], raising the [[neutron flux]] of any sample containing it. The presence of plutonium-240 limits a plutonium sample's usability for weapons or its quality as reactor fuel, and the percentage of plutonium-240 determines its [[reactor-grade plutonium|grade]] (weapons grade, fuel grade, or reactor grade).

[[Plutonium-238]] has a half-life of 88&nbsp;years and emits [[alpha particle]]s. It is a heat source in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s, which are used to power some [[spacecraft]]. Plutonium isotopes are expensive and inconvenient to separate, so particular isotopes are usually manufactured in specialized reactors.

A team led by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] and [[Edwin McMillan]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], first synthesized plutonium in 1940  by bombarding [[uranium-238]] with [[deuteron]]s. Trace amounts of plutonium were subsequently discovered in nature. Producing plutonium in useful quantities for the first time was a major part of the [[Manhattan Project]] during [[World War II]], which developed the first atomic bombs. The first [[nuclear test]], "[[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]]" (July 1945), and the second atomic bomb used to destroy a city ([[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Nagasaki, Japan, in August 1945]]), "[[Fat Man]]", both had cores of plutonium-239. [[Human radiation experiments]] studying plutonium were conducted without [[informed consent]], and several [[criticality accident]]s, some lethal, occurred during and after the war. Disposal of [[nuclear waste|plutonium waste]] from [[nuclear power plant]]s and [[nuclear disarmament|dismantled nuclear weapons]] built during the [[Cold War]] is a [[nuclear proliferation|nuclear-proliferation]] and environmental concern. Other sources of [[plutonium in the environment]] are [[nuclear fallout|fallout]] from numerous above-ground nuclear tests (now [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|banned]]).

[[Resistivity]] is a measure of how strongly a material opposes the flow of [[electric current]].

[[plutonium-241]] is also highly fissile.
To be considered fissile, an isotope's [[atomic nucleus]] must be able to break apart or [[nuclear fission|fission]] when struck by a [[neutron temperature|slow moving neutron]] and to release enough additional neutrons to sustain the [[nuclear chain reaction]] by splitting further nuclei.

Pure plutonium-239 may have a [[four factor formula|multiplication factor]] (k<sub>eff</sub>) larger than one, which means that if the metal is present in sufficient quantity and with an appropriate geometry (e.g., a sphere of sufficient size), it can form a [[critical mass]].<ref>

The isotopes of plutonium range in [[mass number]] from 228 to 247. The primary [[radioactive decay|decay modes]] of isotopes with mass numbers lower than the most stable isotope, plutonium-244, are [[spontaneous fission]] and [[alpha emission|<U+03B1> emission]], mostly forming uranium (92 [[proton]]s) and [[neptunium]] (93 protons) isotopes as [[decay product]]s (neglecting the wide range of daughter nuclei created by fission processes). The primary decay mode for isotopes with mass numbers higher than plutonium-244 is [[beta emission|<U+03B2> emission]], mostly forming [[americium]] (95 protons) isotopes as decay products. Plutonium-241 is the [[parent isotope]] of the [[neptunium decay series]], decaying to americium-241 via <U+03B2> or electron emission.<ref name = "NNDC"/><ref name=p340>{{harvnb|Heiserman|1992|p=340}}</ref>

Plutonium-238 and 239 are the most widely synthesized isotopes.<ref name = "Heiserman1992"/> Plutonium-239 is synthesized via the following reaction using uranium (U) and neutrons (n) via beta decay (<U+03B2><sup><U+2212></sup>) with neptunium (Np) as an intermediate:<ref>{{cite journal|first=J. W.|last=Kennedy|coauthors=Seaborg, G. T.; Segr<U+00E8>, E.; Wahl, A.

Neutrons from the fission of uranium-235 are [[neutron capture|captured]] by uranium-238 nuclei to form uranium-239; a [[beta decay]] converts a neutron into a proton to form Np-239 (half-life 2.36&nbsp;days) and another beta decay forms plutonium-239.<ref name = "Greenwood1997p1259">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p = 1259}}</ref> Workers on the [[Tube Alloys]] project had predicted this reaction theoretically in 1940.

Plutonium-238 is synthesized by bombarding uranium-238 with [[deuteron]]s (D, the nuclei of heavy [[hydrogen]]) in the following reaction:<ref>{{cite journal|first=Glenn T.|last=Seaborg|coauthors=McMillan, E.; Kennedy, J.

In this process, a deuteron hitting uranium-238 produces two neutrons and neptunium-238, which spontaneously decays by emitting negative beta particles to form plutonium-238.

===Decay heat and fission properties===
Plutonium isotopes undergo radioactive decay, which produces [[decay heat]]. Different isotopes produce different amounts of heat per mass. The decay heat is usually listed as watt/kilogram, or milliwatt/gram. In case of larger pieces of plutonium (e.g. a weapon pit) and inadequate heat removal the resulting self-heating may be significant. All isotopes produce weak gamma on decay.

[[Americium-241]], the decay product of plutonium-241, has half-life of 430 years, 1.2 spontaneous fissions per gram per second, and decay heat of 114 watts per kilogram. As its decay produces highly penetrative gamma rays, its presence in plutonium, determined by the original concentration of plutonium-241 and the sample age, increases the radiation exposure of surrounding structures and personnel.

Plutonium is a reactive metal. In moist air or moist [[argon]], the metal oxidizes rapidly, producing a mixture of [[oxide]]s and [[hydride]]s.<ref name = "WISER"/> If the metal is exposed long enough to a limited amount of water vapor, a powdery surface coating of [[plutonium(IV) oxide|PuO<sub>2</sub>]] is formed.<ref name = "WISER"/> Also formed is [[plutonium hydride]] but an excess of water vapor forms only PuO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name = "Miner1968p545"/>

With this coating, the metal is [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]], meaning it can ignite spontaneously, so plutonium metal is usually handled in an inert, dry atmosphere of nitrogen or argon. Oxygen retards the effects of moisture and acts as a [[passivation (chemistry)|passivating]] agent.<ref name = "WISER"/>

Plutonium shows enormous, and reversible, reaction rates with pure hydrogen, forming [[plutonium hydride]].<ref name = "HeckerPlutonium"/> It also reacts readily with oxygen, forming PuO and PuO<sub>2</sub> as well as intermediate oxides; plutonium oxide fills 40% more volume than plutonium metal. The metal reacts with the [[halogen]]s, giving rise to [[chemical compound|compounds]] with the general formula PuX<sub>3</sub> where X can be [[plutonium(III) fluoride|F]], [[plutonium(III) chloride|Cl]], Br or I and [[plutonium tetrafluoride|PuF<sub>4</sub>]] is also seen. The following oxyhalides are observed: PuOCl, PuOBr and PuOI. It will react with carbon to form PuC, nitrogen to form PuN and [[silicon]] to form PuSi<sub>2</sub>.<ref name = "CRC2006p4-27"/><ref name = "Emsley2001"/>

[[Crucible]]s used to contain plutonium need to be able to withstand its strongly [[redox|reducing]] properties. [[Refractory metals]] such as [[tantalum]] and [[tungsten]] along with the more stable oxides, [[boride]]s, [[carbide]]s, [[nitride]]s and [[silicide]]s can tolerate this. Melting in an [[electric arc furnace]] can be used to produce small ingots of the metal without the need for a crucible.<ref name = "Miner1968p542"/>

[[Cerium]] is used as a chemical simulant of plutonium for development of containment, extraction, and other technologies.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Low Temperature Reaction of ReillexTM HPQ and Nitric Acid|author=Crooks, W.

====Electronic structure====
Plutonium is an element in which the [[f shell|5f electrons]] are the transition border between delocalized and localized; it is therefore considered one of the most complex elements.<ref name="physicsworld.com">{{cite news|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/16443|title=Plutonium is also a superconductor|publisher=PhysicsWeb.org|author=Dum<U+00E9>, Belle|date=November 20, 2002}}</ref> The anomalous behavior of plutonium is caused by its electronic structure. The energy difference between the 6d and 5f subshells is very low. The size of the 5f shell is just enough to allow the electrons to form bonds within the lattice, on the very boundary between localized and bonding behavior. The proximity of energy levels leads to multiple low-energy electron configurations with near equal energy levels. This leads to competing 5f<sup>n</sup>7s<sup>2</sup> and 5f<sup>n-1</sup>7s<sup>2</sup>6d<sup>1</sup> configurations, which causes the complexity of its chemical behavior. The highly directional nature of 5f orbitals is responsible for directional covalent bonds in molecules and complexes of plutonium.<ref name = "HeckerPlutonium"/>

===Alloys===
Plutonium can form [[alloy]]s and intermediate compounds with most other metals. Exceptions include [[lithium]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[rubidium]] and [[caesium]] of the [[alkali metal]]s; and [[magnesium]], [[calcium]], [[strontium]], and [[barium]] of the [[alkaline earth metal]]s; and [[europium]] and [[ytterbium]] of the [[rare earth metal]]s.<ref name = "Miner1968p545"/> Partial exceptions include the refractory metals [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[niobium]], [[tantalum]], and [[tungsten]], which are soluble in liquid plutonium, but insoluble or only slightly soluble in solid plutonium.<ref name = "Miner1968p545"/> [[Gallium]], [[aluminium]], [[americium]], [[scandium]] and [[cerium]] can stabilize the <U+03B4> phase of plutonium for room temperature. [[Silicon]], [[indium]], [[zinc]] and [[zirconium]] allow formation of metastable <U+03B4> state when rapidly cooled. High amounts of [[hafnium]], [[holmium]] and [[thallium]] also allows retaining some of the <U+03B4> phase at room temperature. [[Neptunium]] is the only element that can stabilize the <U+03B1> phase at higher temperatures.<ref name = "HeckerPlutonium"/>

Plutonium alloys can be produced by adding a metal to molten plutonium. If the alloying metal is sufficiently reductive, plutonium can be added in the form of oxides or halides. The <U+03B4> phase plutonium-gallium and plutonium-aluminium alloys are produced by adding [[plutonium(III) fluoride]] to molten gallium or aluminium, which has the advantage of avoiding dealing directly with the highly reactive plutonium metal.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=W3FnEOg8tS4C&pg=PA169|page=169|title=Nuclear forensic analysis|author=Moody, Kenton James; Hutcheon, Ian D.; Grant, Patrick M.|publisher=CRC Press|year=2005|isbn=0-8493-1513-1}}</ref>

The breakthrough with plutonium was at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]], [[Cambridge]] by [[Egon Bretscher]] and [[Norman Feather]].
They realized that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product. This is because U-238 absorbs [[slow neutron]]s and forms a new isotope U-239. The new isotope's nucleus rapidly emits an electron through [[beta decay]] producing a new element with a mass of 239 and an atomic number of 93. This element's nucleus then also emits an electron and becomes a new element of mass 239 but with an atomic number 94 and a much greater half-life. Bretscher and Feather showed theoretically feasible grounds that element 94 would be readily 'fissionable' by both slow and fast neutrons, and had the added advantage of being chemically different from uranium, and could easily be separated from it.

This new development was also confirmed in independent work by [[Edwin M. McMillan]] and [[Philip Abelson]] at [[Berkeley Radiation Laboratory]] also in 1940. [[Nicholas Kemmer]] of the Cambridge team proposed the names [[neptunium]] for the new element 93 and plutonium for 94 by analogy with the outer planets Neptune and Pluto beyond Uranus (uranium being element 92). The Americans fortuitously suggested the same names.

===Mixed oxide fuel===
{{main|Nuclear reprocessing}}

[[Spent nuclear fuel]] from normal [[light water reactor]]s contains plutonium, but it is a mixture of plutonium-242, 240, 239 and 238. The mixture is not sufficiently enriched for efficient nuclear weapons, but can be used once as [[MOX fuel]]. Accidental [[neutron capture]] causes the amount of plutonium-242 and 240 to grow each time the plutonium is irradiated in a reactor with low-speed "thermal" neutrons, so that after the second cycle, the plutonium can only be consumed by [[fast neutron reactor]]s. If fast neutron reactors are not available (the normal case), excess plutonium is usually discarded, and forms the longest-lived component of nuclear waste. The desire to consume this plutonium and other [[transuranic]] fuels and reduce the radiotoxicity of the waste is the usual reason nuclear engineers give to make fast neutron reactors.

The most common chemical process, [[PUREX]] (''P''lutonium<U+2013>''UR''anium ''EX''traction) [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocesses]] [[spent nuclear fuel]] to extract plutonium and uranium which can be used to form a mixed oxide "[[MOX fuel]]" for reuse in nuclear reactors. Weapons grade plutonium can be added to the fuel mix. MOX fuel is used in [[light water reactor]]s and consists of 60&nbsp;kg of plutonium per tonne of fuel; after four years, three-quarters of the plutonium is burned (turned into other elements).<ref name = "Emsley2001"/> [[Breeder reactor]]s are specifically designed to create more fissionable material than they consume.

MOX fuel has been in use since the 1980s and is widely used in Europe.<ref>

Plutonium recovered from spent reactor fuel poses a less significant [[nuclear proliferation|proliferation]] hazard, because of excessive contamination with non-fissile [[plutonium-240]] and [[plutonium-242]]. Separation of the isotopes is not feasible. A dedicated reactor operating on very low [[burnup]] (hence minimal exposure of newly formed Pu-239 to additional neutrons which causes it to be transformed to heavier isotopes of plutonium) is generally required to produce material suitable for use in efficient [[nuclear weapons]]. While 'weapons-grade' plutonium is defined to contain at least 92% plutonium-239 (of the total plutonium), the United States have managed to detonate an [[reactor-grade plutonium nuclear test|under-20Kt device]] using plutonium believed to contain only about 85% plutonium-239, so called 'fuel-grade' plutonium.<ref name="inf15"/> The 'reactor grade' plutonium produced by a regular LWR burnup cycle typically contains less than 60% Pu-239, with up to 30% parasitic Pu-240/Pu-242, and 10<U+2013>15% fissile Pu-241.<ref name="inf15"/> It's unknown if a device using plutonium obtained from reprocessed civil nuclear waste can be detonated, however such a device could hypothetically [[fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzle]] and spread radioactive materials over a large urban area. The [[IAEA]] conservatively classifies plutonium of all isotopic vectors as "direct-use" material, that is, "nuclear material that can be used for the manufacture of nuclear explosives components without transmutation or further enrichment".<ref name="inf15">{{cite web

During the decay of plutonium, three types of radiation are released<U+2014>alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha radiation can travel only a short distance and cannot travel through the outer, dead layer of human skin. Beta radiation can penetrate human skin, but cannot go all the way through the body. Gamma radiation can go all the way through the body.<ref>[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/substances/toxsubstance.asp?toxid=119 Plutonium], CAS ID #: 7440-07-5, [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]]</ref> Alpha, beta, and gamma radiation are all forms of [[ionizing radiation]]. Either acute or longer-term exposure carries a danger of [[ionizing radiation#Biological effects|serious health outcomes]] including [[radiation sickness]], [[genetic damage]], [[cancer]], and death. The danger increases with the amount of exposure.

Even though alpha radiation cannot penetrate the skin, ingested or inhaled plutonium does irradiate internal organs.<ref name = "Emsley2001"/> The [[skeleton]], where plutonium is absorbed, and the [[liver]], where it collects and becomes concentrated, are at risk.<ref name = "Miner1968p545"/> Plutonium is not absorbed into the body efficiently when ingested; only 0.04% of plutonium oxide is absorbed after ingestion.<ref name = "Emsley2001"/> Plutonium absorbed by the body is excreted very slowly, with a [[biological half-life]] of 200 years.<ref>

When inhaled, plutonium can pass into the bloodstream. Once in the bloodstream, plutonium moves throughout the body and into the bones, liver, or other body organs. Plutonium that reaches body organs generally stays in the body for decades and continues to expose the surrounding tissue to radiation and thus may cause cancer.<ref name="EPA">{{cite web |title = Radiation Protection, Plutonium: What does plutonium do once it gets into the body? |publisher = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate = March 15, 2011 |url = http://www.epa.gov/radiation/radionuclides/plutonium.html}}</ref>

A commonly cited quote by [[Ralph Nader]], states that a pound of plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere would be enough to kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of [[nerve gas]].<ref name=Cohen-13>{{cite web | url=http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/book/chapter13.html | author=Bernard L.

Several populations of people who have been exposed to plutonium dust (e.g. people living down-wind of Nevada test sites, [[Hibakusha|Nagasaki survivors]], nuclear facility workers, and "terminally ill" patients injected with Pu in 1945<U+2013>46 to study Pu metabolism) have been carefully followed and analyzed. These studies generally do not show especially high plutonium toxicity or plutonium-induced cancer results, such as [[Albert Stevens]] who survived into old age after being injected with plutonium.<ref name="CohenMyth"/> "There were about 25 workers from Los Alamos National Laboratory who inhaled a considerable amount of plutonium dust during 1940s; according to the hot-particle theory, each of them has a 99.5% chance of being dead from lung cancer by now, but there has not been a single lung cancer among them."<ref name=Cohen-13/><ref>{{cite journal

===Criticality potential===

In the 3-inch hole in the top plate there is a gray metal ball.]]
Toxicity issues aside, care must be taken to avoid the accumulation of amounts of plutonium which approach [[critical mass (nuclear)|critical mass]], particularly because plutonium's critical mass is only a third of that of uranium-235.<ref name = "Heiserman1992"/> A critical mass of plutonium emits lethal amounts of neutrons and [[gamma ray]]s.<ref name = "Miner1968p546">{{harvnb|Miner|1968|p = 546}}</ref> Plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to [[neutron moderator|moderation]] by the hydrogen in water.<ref name = "CRC2006p4-27"/>

[[Criticality accident]]s have occurred in the past, some of them with lethal consequences. Careless handling of [[tungsten carbide]] bricks around a 6.2&nbsp;kg plutonium sphere resulted in a fatal dose of radiation at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] on August 21, 1945, when scientist [[Harry K. Daghlian, Jr.]] received a dose estimated to be 5.1&nbsp;[[Sievert]] (510&nbsp;[[Roentgen equivalent man|rems]]) and died 25&nbsp;days later.<ref>

===Flammability===
Metallic plutonium is a fire hazard, especially if the material is finely divided. In a moist environment, plutonium forms hydrides on its surface, which are [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]] and may ignite in air at room temperature. Plutonium expands up to 70% in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container.<ref name = "NucSafety"/> The radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard. [[Magnesium oxide]] sand is probably the most effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire. It cools the burning material, acting as a [[heat sink]], and also blocks off oxygen. Special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form; generally a dry [[inert gas]] atmosphere is required.<ref name = "NucSafety">{{cite web|url = http://www.hss.energy.gov/NuclearSafety/techstds/standard/hdbk1081/hbk1081d.html#ZZ281|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070428220410/http://www.hss.energy.gov/NuclearSafety/techstds/standard/hdbk1081/hbk1081d.html#ZZ281|archivedate = April 28, 2007|title = Primer on Spontaneous Heating and Pyrophoricity <U+2013> Pyrophoric Metals <U+2013> Plutonium|author = DOE contributors|publisher = U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Safety, Quality Assurance and Environment|year = 1994|location = Washington (DC)}}</ref><ref group=note>There was a major plutonium-initiated fire at the [[Rocky Flats Plant]] near [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Colorado]] in 1969.
