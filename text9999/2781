== Timeline ==
=== Lawsuit ===
In 2001 the musicians filed a lawsuit against [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] because they felt that they did not get compensated fairly for their work on [[Dieter Bohlen]] productions, such as Modern Talking, Blue System, [[C.C.Catch]], [[Nino de Angelo]], [[Chris Norman]], [[Thomas Forstner]] and other. The lawsuit was settled out of court. BMG Berlin confirmed that the studio musicians who filed the lawsuit contributed to the chorus of most Blue System and Modern Talking songs (besides ''[[America (Modern Talking album)|America]]'', ''[[Victory (Modern Talking album)|Victory]]'', and ''Universe'') and all voices were then mixed together and multiplied electronically to get the typical sound for the high-pitched voices.<ref>http://www.discogs.com/artist/Systems+In+Blue</ref> <ref>http://www.talkingforever.com/systemsinblue/rolfproduction.htm</ref><ref name="Bohlens S<U+00E4>nger ist tot (Bohlen's singer is dead)">{{cite web |url=http://www.stern.de/kultur/musik/rolf-koehler-bohlens-saenger-ist-tot-598031.html |title= Bohlens S<U+00E4>nger ist tot (Bohlen's singer is dead)|publisher=Stern|accessdate=09-08-13|date=2007-09-18 |language=German}}</ref>
