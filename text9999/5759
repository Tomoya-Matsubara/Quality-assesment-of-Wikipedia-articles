==History==
Diazepam was the second benzodiazepine to be invented by [[Leo Sternbach]] of [[Hoffmann-La Roche]], and was approved for use in [[1963]]. It is five times more potent than its predecessor, [[chlordiazepoxide]], which it quickly surpassed in terms of sales. After this initial success, other pharmaceutical companies began to introduce other benzodiazepine derivatives.<ref name="Obituary">{{cite news

The benzodiazepines gained popularity among medical professionals as an improvement upon [[barbiturate]]s, which have a comparatively narrow [[therapeutic index]], and are far more sedating at therapeutic doses. The benzodiazepines are also far less dangerous; death rarely results from diazepam overdose, except in cases where it is consumed with large amounts of other [[depressants]] (such as alcohol or other sedatives).<ref name="Barondes1">{{cite book

Diazepam was the top-selling pharmaceutical in the [[United States]] from 1969 to 1982, with peak sales in 1978 of 2.3 billion pills.<ref name="Obituary" /> In 1966, [[The Rolling Stones]] released the song "[[Mother's Little Helper]]," which is about a mother needing the "little yellow pill" to get through the day.<ref name="RollingStones">{{cite web

While psychiatrists continue to prescribe diazepam for the short-term relief of anxiety, neurology has taken the lead in prescribing diazepam for the [[palliative]] treatment of certain types of epilepsy and spastic activity, e.g., forms of [[paresis]].  It is also the first line of defense for a rare disorder called [[stiff-person syndrome]].<ref name="RXL.Indications">{{cite web

==Pharmacokinetics==
Diazepam can be administered orally, [[intravenous therapy|intravenous]]ly, [[intramuscular injection|intramuscular]]ly, or as a [[suppository]].<ref name="Inchem">{{cite web

}}</ref>

When diazepam is administered orally, it is rapidly absorbed and has a fast onset of action. The onset of action is 1-5 minutes for IV administration and 15-30 minutes for IM administration. The duration of the diazepam's main pharmacological effects is 15 minutes to 1 hour for both routes of administration.<ref name="Cuny.edu">{{cite web

Peak plasma levels are achieved 30 minutes to 2 hours after oral administration. When diazepam is administered as an intramuscular injection, absorption is slow, erratic and incomplete.<ref name="DrugBank" /><ref name="ElephantCare">{{cite web

Diazepam is highly lipid-soluble, and is widely distributed throughout the body after administration. It easily crosses both the [[blood-brain barrier]] and the [[placenta]], and is excreted into breast milk. After absorption, diazepam is redistributed into [[muscle]] and [[adipose]] tissue. Continual daily doses of diazepam will quickly build up to a high concentration in the body (mainly in adipose tissue), which will be far in excess of the actual dose for any given day.<ref name="Inchem" /><ref name="ElephantCare" />

Diazepam is metabolised in the [[liver]] via the [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme system. It has a biphasic [[half-life]] of 1-2 and 2-5 days, and has several pharmacologically active metabolites. The main active metabolite of diazepam is [[nordazepam|desmethyldiazepam]] (also known as ''nordazepam'' or ''nordiazepam''). Diazepam's other active metabolites include [[temazepam]] and [[oxazepam]]. These metabolites are conjugated with [[glucuronide]], and are excreted primarily in the urine. Because of these active metabolites, the serum values of diazepam alone are not useful in predicting the effects of the drug.<ref name="DrugBank" /><ref name="ElephantCare" />

Diazepam has a half-life (t1/2<U+03B1>) of 20-50 hours, and desmethyldiazepam has a half-life of 30-200 hours.<ref name="ElephantCare" />

Most of the drug is metabolised; very little diazepam is excreted unchanged.<ref name="Inchem" />

In humans, the protein binding of diazepam is around 98.5%.<ref name="DrugBank" />

==Indications==
Diazepam is mainly used to treat anxiety, insomnia, and symptoms of acute [[alcohol]] or [[opiate]] [[withdrawal]]. It is also used as a [[premedication]] for inducing sedation, anxiolysis or amnesia prior to certain medical procedures (e.g. [[endoscopy]]).<ref name="DrugBank" />

Diazepam is rarely used as a primary drug for the long-term treatment of epilepsy. This is due to the fact that tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam usually develops within 6 to 12 months of treatment, effectively rendering it useless for this purpose.<ref name="Inchem" />

Diazepam has a broad spectrum of indications (most of which are off-label), including:

* Treatment of [[anxiety]], [[panic attacks]], and states of [[agitation]]<ref name="DrugBank" />

* Treatment of [[status epilepticus]], adjunctive treatment of other forms of epilepsy<ref name="DrugBank" />

* Treatment of the symptoms of alcohol and opiate withdrawal<ref name="DrugBank" />

* Short-term treatment of [[insomnia]]<ref name="DrugBank" />

==Dosage==
Dosages should be determined on an individual basis, depending upon the condition to be treated, the severity of symptoms, the body weight of the patient, and any [[Comorbidity|comorbid]] conditions the patient may have.<ref name="Inchem" />

Elderly patients and those with liver disorders experience decreased metabolism of diazepam; therefore the dosage for these patients should be reduced. General guidelines for this group of patients: initial doses of 2mg to 2.5mg, 1 or 2 times daily; increase gradually as required/tolerated.<ref name="Drugs.com" />

Patients with severe attacks of [[apnea]] during sleep may suffer [[respiratory depression]] (hypoventilation) leading to respiratory arrest and death.

Organic changes such as leukopenia<ref name=leukopenia>{{cite journal | last = Haerten | first = K. | coauthors = W.

==Interactions==
If diazepam is to be administered concomitantly with other drugs, attention should be paid to the possible pharmacological interactions. Particular care should be taken with drugs that enhance the effects of diazepam, such as barbiturates, [[phenothiazines]], [[narcotics]] and [[antidepressants]].<ref name="Drugs.com" />

Diazepam does not increase or decrease hepatic enzyme activity, and does not alter the metabolism of other compounds. There is no evidence that would suggest diazepam alters its own metabolism with chronic administration.<ref name="Inchem" />

Agents which have an effect on hepatic cytochrome P450 pathways or conjugation can alter the rate of diazepam metabolism. These interactions would be expected to be most significant with long-term diazepam therapy, and their clinical significance is variable.<ref name="Inchem" />

* Diazepam increases the central depressive effects of alcohol, other [[hypnotic]]s/sedatives (e.g. barbiturates), narcotics, and other [[muscle relaxant]]s. The euphoriant effects of opioids may be increased, leading to increased risk of psychological dependence.<ref name="Holt">{{cite book

==Contraindications==
Use of diazepam should be avoided, when possible, in individuals with the following conditions:
* [[Ataxia]]
* Severe [[hypoventilation]]
* Acute narrow-angle [[glaucoma]]
* Severe [[hepatic]] deficiencies ([[hepatitis]] and liver [[cirrhosis]] decrease elimination by a factor of 2)
* Severe [[renal]] deficiencies (e.g. patients on [[dialysis]])
* Severe [[sleep apnea]]
* Severe [[clinical depression|depression]], particularly when accompanied by suicidal tendencies
* Acute intoxication with alcohol, narcotics, or other psychoactive substances
* [[Myasthenia gravis]]
* Hypersensitivity or allergy to any drug in the [[benzodiazepine]] class

====Special caution needed====
* Pediatric patients
** Less than 18 years of age - Treatment usually not indicated, except treatment of epilepsy, and pre-/postoperative treatment. The smallest possible effective dose should be used for this group of patients.<ref name="PDRhealth" />
** Under 6 months of age - Safety and effectiveness have not been established; diazepam should not be given to individuals in this age group.<ref name="Drugs.com" /><ref name="PDRhealth" />

* Elderly and very ill patients - Possibility that apnea and/or cardiac arrest may occur. Concomitant use of other central nervous system depressants increases this risk. The smallest possible effective dose should be used for this group of patients..<ref name="Drugs.com" /><ref name="PDRhealth" /><ref name="RXL.Caution">{{cite web

* I.V. or I.M. injections in hypotensive individuals or those in shock should be administered carefully and vital signs should be monitored.<ref name="RXL.Caution" />

====Patients at a high risk for abuse and dependence====
Diazepam can lead to [[physiological tolerance]], and psychological and/or physical dependence{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. At a particularly high risk for diazepam misuse, abuse, and dependence are:
* Patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse or dependence<ref name="Drugs.com" /><ref name="RXL.Abuse">{{cite web

* Patients with chronic pain or other physical disorders{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Patients from the aforementioned groups should be monitored very closely during therapy for signs of abuse and development of dependence. Discontinue therapy if any of these signs are noted. Long-term therapy in these patients is not recommended.<ref name="Drugs.com" /><ref name="RXL.Abuse" /> The [[American Society of Addiction Medicine]] has policy indicating that patients with addictive disease should not be prescribed benzodiazepines such as diazepam.

==Overdose==
An individual who has consumed too much diazepam will display one or more of the following symptoms<ref name="Drugs.com" /><ref name="RXL.Overdose">{{cite web

Although not usually fatal when taken alone, a diazepam overdose is considered a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. The [[antidote]] for an overdose of diazepam (or any other benzodiazepine) is [[flumazenil]] (Anexate<U+00AE>). This drug is only used in cases with severe respiratory depression or cardiovascular complications. Because flumazenil is a short-acting drug and the effects of diazepam can last for days, several doses of flumazenil may be necessary. [[Artificial respiration]] and stabilization of cardiovascular functions may also be necessary. Although not routinely indicated, [[activated charcoal]] can be used for decontamination of the stomach following a diazepam overdose. [[Emesis]] is contraindicated. [[Dialysis]] is minimally effective. Hypotension may be treated with [[levarterenol]] or [[metaraminol]].<ref name="Inchem"/><ref name="Barondes1"/><ref name="Drugs.com"/><ref name="RXL.Overdose"/>

The oral [[LD50|LD<sub>50</sub>]] (lethal dose in 50% of the population) of diazepam is 720mg/kg in mice and 1240mg/kg in rats.<ref name="Drugs.com"/> D. J. Greenblatt and colleagues reported in 1978 on two patients who had taken 2000 and 500 mg of diazepam, respectively, went into moderately deep comas, and were discharged within 48 hours without having experienced important complications in spite of having high concentrations of diazepam and its metabolites&mdash;desmethyldiazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam&mdash;according to samples taken in the hospital and as follow-up.<ref name=Greenblatt_et_al_1978>{{cite journal | last = Greenblatt | first = D.

Overdoses of diazepam with alcohol and/or other depressants may be fatal.<ref name="Barondes1"/>

==Recreational use==
Generally, diazepam is not used as a [[recreational drug]] as frequently as [[alprazolam]] or [[flunitrazepam]]. 

Diazepam is often found as an [[adulterant]] in heroin.<ref name=heroin_adulterant>{{cite web | url = http://www.incb.org/incb/en/annual_report_1996_chapter2.html#IIB10 | title = CHAPTER II.

Sometimes diazepam is used by stimulant abusers to 'come down' and sleep and to help control the urge to binge<ref name=with_meth>{{cite web | url = http://de1.erowid.org/experiences/exp.phpquery=ID=9402.html | title = Methamphetamine and Benzodiazepines: Methamphetamine & Benzodiazepines | accessmonthday = September 26 | accessyear = 2006 | author = Overclocker | work = Erowid Experience Vaults }}</ref> and also by users of LSD and other hallucinogens to help ease their trip without unpleasant after-effects.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Physical properties==
Diazepam occurs as solid white or yellow crystals and has a melting point of 131.5 to 134.5<U+00B0>C. It is odorless, and has a slightly bitter taste. The [[British Pharmacopoeia]] lists diazepam as being very slightly soluble in water, soluble in alcohol and freely soluble in chloroform. The [[United States Pharmacopoeia]] lists diazepam as soluble 1 in 16 of ethyl alcohol, 1 in 2 of chloroform, 1 in 39 of ether, and practically insoluble in water. The [[pH]] of diazepam is neutral (i.e. 7). Diazepam has a shelf-life of 5 years for oral tablets and 3 years for IV/IM solution.<ref name="Inchem">{{cite web

Diazepam should be stored at room temperature (15<U+00B0>-30<U+00B0>C). The solution for parenteral injection should be protected from light and kept from freezing. The oral forms should be stored in air-tight containers and protected from light.<ref name="ElephantCare">{{cite web

Diazepam can absorb into plastic, and therefore diazepam solution is not stored in plastic bottles or syringes. It can absorb into plastic bags and tubing used for intervenous infusions. Absorption appears to be dependent on several factors such as temperature, concentration, flow rates and tube length. Diazepam should not be administered if a precipitate has formed and will not dissolve.<ref name="ElephantCare" />
