The '''[[Shroud of Turin]],''' a linen cloth commonly associated with the crucifixion and burial of [[Jesus Christ]], has undergone numerous scientific tests, the most notable of which is [[radiocarbon dating]], in an attempt to determine the [[relic]]'s authenticity. In 1988, scientists at three separate laboratories dated samples from the Shroud to a range of 1260<U+2013>1390CE, which coincides with the first appearance of the shroud in France in the 1350s.<ref name=nature>[http://www.shroud.com/nature.htm P. E. Damon ''et al.'', "Radiocarbon dating of the Shroud of Turin", ''Nature''; '''337''', 611-615 (1989)]</ref>

This dating has been questioned by some, and doubts have been raised in particular regarding the representivity of the sample that was taken for testing.

==History==

===1978: the creation of S.Tu.R.P.===
The idea of scientifically dating the shroud had first been proposed in the 1960s, but permission had been refused because the procedure would have required the destruction of too much fabric (almost 0.05 sq m <U+2245> 0.538 sq ft). The development in the 1970s of new techniques for radio-carbon dating, which required lower quantities of source material,<ref>Harbottle, G. - W. Heino - Carbon Dating the Shroud of Turin - A Test of Recent Improvements in the Technique - Archaeological Chemistry IV, Allen Ralph O. ed., Advances in Chemistry Series 220, American Chemical Society, Washington D.C, 1989, Chapter 16, pp. 313-320.</ref> prompted the Catholic Church to found the ''[[Shroud of Turin Research Project]]'' (S.Tu.R.P.), which involved about 30 scientists of various religious faiths, including non-Christians.

The S.Tu.R.P. group initially planned to conduct a range of different studies on the cloth, including radio-carbon dating.<ref>Jumper, E.J., and Mottern, R.W. (1980). Scientific investigation of the Shroud of Turin. Appl. Opt 19, 1909<U+2013>1912.</ref><ref>Jumper, E.J. - An Overview of the Testing Performed by the Shroud of Turin Research Project with a Summary of Results - IEEE 1982 Proceedings of the International Conference on Cybernetics and Society, October 1982, pp. 535-537.</ref> A commission headed by chemist [[Robert H. Dinegar]] and physicist [[Harry E. Gove]] consulted numerous laboratories which were able at the time (1982) to carbon-date small fabric samples. The six labs that showed interest in performing the procedure fell into two categories, according to the method they utilised:
*Two used a [[proportional counter]] approach:
**[[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], [[Upton, New York|Upton]], [[New York]], [[USA]];
**[[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]], [[Harwell]], [[Oxfordshire]], [[UK]];
*Four used [[accelerator mass spectrometry]]:
**[[Nuclear Structure Research Laboratory]], [[University of Rochester]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], New York, USA;
**the [[University of Oxford]], UK;
**[[University of Arizona]], [[Tucson, Arizona]], USA;
** [[ETH Z<U+00FC>rich]], [[Switzerland]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shroud.com/history.htm |title=Shroud History |publisher=Shroud.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}</ref>
To obtain independent and replicable results, and to avoid conflict between the laboratories, it was decided to let all interested laboratories perform the tests at the same time.<ref>Robert Patruno. ''E quel falso lenzuolo divent<U+00F2> un business. La Repubblica, October 15, 1988, p. 20.</ref>

===The 1985 rift between S.Tu.R.P. and the candidate labs===
In 1982, the S.Tu.R.P. group published the list of tests to be performed on the shroud; these aimed to identify how the image was impressed onto the cloth, to verify the relic's purported origin, and to identify better-suited conservation methods. However, a disagreement between the S.Tu.R.P. group and the candidate laboratories devolved into a P.R. rift:<ref>Schafersman, S. D. - Are the STURP scientists pseudoscientists? - The Microscope 30 No.3, 1982, pp. 232-34.</ref> the S.Tu.R.P. group expected to perform the [[Radiometer|radiometric examination]] under its own aegis and after the other examinations had been completed, while the laboratories considered radio-carbon dating to be ''the'' priority test, which should be completed at the detriment of other tests, if necessary.<ref>Power, B.A. - Implications of Energy Compressibility for Shroud of Turin Image-Process and Carbon-14 Dating - Typescript - Dorval, Quebec, Canada, Jan. 20, 1984, pp. 1-11.</ref>

===The "Turin protocol of 1986"===
A meeting with ecclesiastic authorities took place on September 29, 1986 to determine the way forward. In the end, a compromise solution was reached with the so-called "Turin protocol",<ref>Jennings, P. - Art Historian Not Convinced the Shroud is a Fake - Our Sunday Visitor, Oct. 23, 1988, p. 24.</ref><ref>Jennings, P. - Shroud of Turin to Undergo Radiocarbon Testing - Our Sunday Visitor, Feb. 14, 1988, p.3.</ref> which stated that:
*carbon-dating would be the only test performed;<ref>{{cite journal | author=Meachum, W. | title=Radiocarbon Measurement and the Age of the Turin Shroud: Possibilities and Uncertainties | journal = Shroud Spectrum International | year = 1986 | volume = 19 | issue =  | pages= }}</ref>
*original and control samples, indistinguishable from each other, would be provided ([[blind test]]);
*the test would be performed concurrently by seven<ref>Nell'occasione si era aggiunto ai candidati anche il [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|laboratorio francese]] di [[Gif-sur-Yvette]].</ref> laboratories, under the joint supervision of the Pontifical Academy of Science, the archbishop of Turin, and the British Museum;

*the British Museum would manage the distribution of the samples;
*laboratories would not communicate with each other during the analysis, nor divulge the results of the tests to anyone but the three supervising authorities.<ref>Prestipino, C.A. - Il carbonio-14 e la S.

The Vatican subsequently decided to adopt a different protocol instead.<ref>Anderson, I. - Vatican undermines tests on Turin shroud - New Scientist, January 21, 1988, p. 22.</ref>
*On April 27, 1987 a Vatican spokesperson announced to the newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'' that the procedure would likely be performed by two or three laboratories at most;
*On October 10, cardinal [[Anastasio Ballestrero]] officially announced to the seven laboratories that the proportional counter method would not be used because this method would require too much Shroud material (gram quantities rather than milligram quantities).<ref>White, N.R., D.

*The sole supervising institution would be the British Museum, headed by Dr Michael Tite;
These deviations  were heavily criticized.<ref>Raloff, J. - Controversy Builds as Shroud Tests Near - Science News, April 16, 1988, p. 245.</ref> 

The blind-test method was abandoned, because the distinctive three-to-one herringbone twill weave of the shroud could not be matched in the controls, and it was therefore still possible for a laboratory to identify the shroud sample.  Shredding the samples would not solve the problem, while making it much more difficult and wasteful to clean the samples properly.<ref>Radiocarbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin, Damon et al, Nature, Vol. 337, No. 6208, pp. 611-615, 16th February, 1989, </ref> Professor Harry Gove, director of Rochester's laboratory (one of the four not selected by the Vatican), argued in an open letter published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''<ref>H. E. Gove, ''Radiocarbon-dating the shroud'', Nature 333, 110 (1988)</ref> that discarding the blind-test method would expose the results - whatever they may be - to suspicion of unreliability.

In the heated debate that followed, a Church's spokesperson declared that {{quote|(t)he Church must respond to the challenge of those who want it to stop the process, who would want us to show that the Church fears the science. <br/>We are faced with actual blackmail: unless we accept the conditions imposed by the laboratories, they will start a marketing campaign of accusations against the Church, which they will portray as scared of the truth and enemy of science. [...] <br/>The pressure on the ecclesiastic authorities to accept the Turin protocol have almost approached illegality.|Luigi Gonella<ref>[http://xoomer.alice.it/bachm/VHAELST6.PDF Radiocarbon dating the shroud of Turin A critical review of the Nature report (authored by Damon et al.) with a complete unbiased statistical analysis], Remi Van Haelst, Collegamento pro Sindone Internet - ottobre 2002.</ref>}}

===The final protocol===
The proposed changes to the Turin protocol sparked another heated debate among scientists, and the sampling procedure was postponed.<ref>Anonymous - Shroud Dating Isn't Ironed Out - Science News, 1987, 132, p. 302.</ref>

On April 17, 1988, ten years after the S.Tu.R.P. project had been initiated, British Museum scientific director Michael Tite published in Nature<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v332/n6164/pdf/332482c0.pdf |title=Turin Shroud |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-11-29}}</ref> the "final" protocol:
*the laboratories at Oxford, Z<U+00FC>rich and Tucson would perform the test;
*they would each receive one sample weighing 40&nbsp;mg., sampled from a single portion of weave;
*the laboratories would each receive two control samples, clearly distinguishable from the shroud sample;
*samples would be delivered to the laboratories' representatives in Turin;
*each test would be filmed;
*there would be no comparison of results (nor communication) between laboratories until the results be certified as definitive, univocal and complete;
*the proportional counter method would not be used because it required gram quantities rather than milligram quantities of shroud material.

Among the most obvious differences between the final version of the protocol and the previous ones stands the decision to sample from a single location on the cloth.<ref>Marino, J.G., and Benford, M.S. (2000). Evidence for the Skewing of the C-14 Dating of the Shroud of Turin Due to Repairs.</ref> This is particularly significant because, should the chosen portion be in any way not representative of the remainder of the shroud, the results would only be applicable to that portion of the cloth.<ref>Marino, J. - The Shroud of Turin and the Carbon 14 Controversy - Fidelity, Feb. 1989, pp. 36-45.</ref>

A further, relevant difference was the deletion of the blind test method, considered by most scholars as the very foundation of the scientific method.<ref>Van Oosterwyck-Gastuche, M.-C. - Le Sain Suaire et le radiocarbone - Sel de la Terre, No. 20, Printemps 1997, pp. 31-54.</ref><ref>Van Oosterwyck-Gastuche, M.-C. -Que penser des ages radiocarbone? - Science et Foi- Les Nouvelles du CESHE (Cercle Scientifique et Historique, Tournai, Belgique), No. 30, 4eme trimestre 1993, pp. 23-31.</ref><ref>Whanger, A.D. - Whanger, M. - Comments on the C-14 Carbon Dating Results on the Shroud of Turin - Typescript, Sept. 29, 1988, pp. 1-4.</ref> The blind-test method was abandoned because the distinctive three-to-one herringbone twill weave of the shroud could not be matched in the controls, and it was therefore still possible for a laboratory to identify the shroud sample.

==Account of the testing process==

===Sampling (April 1988)===
Samples were taken on April 21, 1988 in the [[Turin Cathedral|Cathedral]] by [[Franco Testore]], an expert on weaves and fabrics, and by Giovanni Riggi, a representative of the maker of bio-equipment "Numana". Testore performed the weighting operations, while Riggi made the actual cut. Also present were Cardinal Ballestrero, four priests, archdiocese spokesperson Luigi Gonella, photographers, a camera operator, Michael Tite of the British Museum and the labs' representatives. 

As a precautionary measure, a piece twice as big as the one required by the protocol was cut from the Shroud; it measured {{convert|81|x|21|mm|2|abbr=on}}. A strip showing coloured filaments of uncertain origin was discarded.<ref>Anonymous - Rogue Fibres Found in the Shroud - Textile Horizons, December 1988.</ref> The remaining sample, measuring {{convert|81|x|16|mm|2|abbr=on}} and weighing 300&nbsp;mg, was first divided in two equal parts, one of which was preserved in a sealed container, in the custody of the Vatican, in case of future need. The other half was cut into three segments, and packaged for the labs in a separate room by Dr Tite and the archbishop. The lab representatives were not present at this packaging process, in accordance with the protocol. 

The labs were also each given three control samples (one more than originally intended), that were:
*a fragment of weave coming from an Egyptian burial, discovered in 1964 and already carbon-dated to 1100 A.D.;
*a piece of mummy bandage carbon-dated to 200 A.D.;
*a sample of the cloak having belonged to [[Louis IX of France]] and preserved in [[Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume|Saint-Maximin]], [[Var (department)|Var]], [[France]], which had a verifiable provenance and was woven between 1240 and 1270.

===May<U+2013>September 1988===
Tucson performed the tests in May, Z<U+00FC>rich in June, and Oxford in August,<ref>Hedges, R.E.M. - R. A. Housley - C.R. Bronk - G.J. Van Klinken - Radiocarbon dates from the Oxford AMS system: Archaeometry datelist 11 - Historical and religious artefacts - Shroud of Turin - Archaeometry, Vol. 32, Part 2, Aug. 1990, p. 233</ref> and communicated their results to the British Museum.

On September 28, 1988, British Museum director and coordinator of the study Michael Tite communicated the official results to the Diocese of Turin and to the [[Holy See]]. 

===Official announcement===
In a well-attended press conference on October 13, Cardinal Ballestrero announced the official results, i.e. that radio-carbon testing dated the shroud to a date of 1260-1390 CE, with 95% confidence.
The official and complete report on the experiment was published in ''Nature''.<ref name="Damon_Nature">Damon, P. E.; Donahue, D. J.; Gore, B. H.; Hatheway, A. L.; Jull, A. J. T.; Linick, T.

Nature 1989, 337, 611-615</ref> The uncalibrated dates from the individual laboratories, with 1-sigma errors (68% confidence), were as follows:

*Oxford: 750 <U+00B1> 30 years;
*Z<U+00FC>rich: 676 <U+00B1> 24 years old;
*the weighted mean was 689 <U+00B1> 16 years, which corresponds to calibrated ages of CE 1273-1288 with 68% confidence, and CE 1262-1384 with 95% confidence.
As reported in ''Nature'', Professor Bray of the Instituto di Metrologia 'G. Colonetti', Turin, "confirmed that the results of the three laboratories were mutually compatible, and that, on the evidence submitted, none of the mean results was questionable."<ref name="Damon_Nature"/>

==Criticisms of the dating result==

===The sample was part of a later repair===
Although the quality of the radiocarbon testing itself is unquestioned, criticisms have been raised regarding the choice of the sample taken for testing, with suggestions that the sample may represent a medieval repair fragment rather than the image-bearing cloth.<ref>Busson, P. <U+2013> Letter <U+2013> Sampling error? <U+2013> Nature, Vol. 352, July 18, 1991, p. 187.</ref><ref>John L.

Since the C14 dating at least four articles have been published in scholarly sources contending that the samples used for the dating test may not have been representative of the whole shroud.<ref name=Sampling >R.N Rogers, "Studies on the Radiocarbon Sample from the Shroud of Turin", ''Thermochimica Acta'', Vol. 425, 2005, pp. 189<U+2013>194, [http://www.shroud.it/ROGERS-3.PDF article]; S.

Raymond Rogers argued in a 2005 article that the chemical analysis he performed show traces of tanning products, likely used by medieval weavers to match the colour of the original weave when performing repairs and backing the shroud for additional protection.<ref name="Raymond N. Rogers 2004">Raymond N. Rogers, 2004, Studies on the radiocarbon sample from the shroud of turin, Thermochimica Acta 425 (2005) 189<U+2013>194</ref> Rogers stated that after further study he was convinced that: "The worst possible sample for carbon dating was taken."<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/5137163/Turin-Shroud-could-be-genuine-as-carbon-dating-was-flawed.html ''Turin Shroud 'could be genuine as carbon-dating was flawed''] Stephen Adams in the [[Daily Telegraph]] 10 Apr 2009</ref> Rogers' conclusions are however based on a study of a few threads that Rogers believed were taken from the C14 shroud sample, but there is no evidence to support their provenance or that they are indeed representative of the C14 sample.<ref>Steven D. Schafersman, 2005; http://freeinquiry.com/skeptic/shroud/articles/rogers-ta-response.htm</ref>

The official report of the dating process, written by the people who performed the sampling, states that the sample "came from a single site on the main body of the shroud away from any patches or charred areas."<ref>Damon et al, Nature, Vol. 337, No. 6208, pp. 611-615, see http://www.shroud.com/nature.htm</ref>

In 2008 former STURP member John Jackson rejected the possibility that the C14 sample may have been conducted on a medieval repair fragment, on the basis that the radiographs and transmitted light images taken by STURP in 1978 clearly show that the natural colour bandings present throughout the linen of the shroud propagate in an uninterrupted fashion through the region that would later provide the sample for radiocarbon dating. Jackson stated that this could not have been possible if the sampled area was a later addition.<ref name=JJackson2008 >''A New Radiocarbon Hypothesis'' by John P. Jackson; [Turin Shroud Center of Colorado; May 5, 2008 http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/jackson.pdf]</ref>

She has written that it<U+2019>s possible to repair a coarsely woven fabric in such a way as to be invisible, if the damage was not too severe and the original warp threads are still present, but that it is never possible to repair a fine fabric in a way which would be truly invisible, as the repair will always be "unequivocally visible on the reverse of the fabric." She criticized the theory that the C14 tests were done on an invisible patch as "wishful thinking". She states that Gabriel Vial, a textile expert who was present when the sample was taken, confirmed repeatedly that the sample was taken from the original cloth, and that "neither on the front nor on the back of the whole cloth is the slightest hint of a mending operation, a patch or some kind of reinforcing darning, to be found."<ref>http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n65part5.pdf</ref>

In 2010, professors of statistics Marco Riani and Anthony C. Atkinson wrote in a scientific paper that the statistical analysis of the raw dates obtained from the three laboratories for the radiocarbon test suggests the presence of contamination in some of the samples. They conclude that: "The effect is not large over the sampled region <U+2026> our estimate of the change is about two centuries."<ref>Riani M., Atkinson A.C., Fanti G., Crosilla F., (4 May 2010).

In March 2013 Giulio Fanti, professor of mechanical and thermal measurement at the University of Padua conducted a battery of experiments on various threads that he believes were cut from the shroud during the 1988 Carbon-14 dating, and concluded that they dated from 300 B.C. to 400 A.D., potentially placing the Shroud within the lifetime of Jesus of Nazareth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/28/shroud-of-turin-real-jesus_n_2971850.html |title=Shroud Of Turin Real?

''Thermochimica Acta'', Volume 425, Issue 1<U+2013>2 (January 20, 2005), pages 189<U+2013>194</ref> argued in the scientific journal ''Thermochimica Acta'' that the presence of vanillin differed markedly between the unprovenanced threads he was looking at, which contained 37% of the original vanillin, while the body of the shroud contained 0% of the original vanillin. He stated that: "The fact that vanillin cannot be detected in the lignin on shroud fibers, Dead Sea scrolls linen, and other very old linens indicate that the shroud is quite old. A determination of the kinetics of vanillin loss suggest the shroud is between 1300- and 3000-years old. Even allowing for errors in the measurements and assumptions about storage conditions, the cloth is unlikely to be as young as 840 years".<ref name="Raymond N. Rogers 2004"/> Rogers concluded from this that the Shroud is much older than the earlier purported estimates.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kerry Mills |url=http://shroud2000.com/CarbonDatingNews.html |title=The Story behind the Shroud of Turin Carbon Dating Debacle |publisher=Shroud2000.com |date=2005-01-20 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://greatshroudofturinfaq.com/Science/Dating/vanillin3.html |title=What does it mean that the vanillin in the shroud is fully depleted? |publisher=Greatshroudofturinfaq.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newgeology.us/presentation24.html |title=Shroud of Turin - evidence it is authentic; the real shroud of Jesus Christ |publisher=Newgeology.us |date=2005-01-20 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}</ref><ref name="shroudstory.wordpress.com">{{cite web|author=Dan |url=http://shroudstory.wordpress.com/2012/02/27/carbon-14-dating-on-shroud-of-turin-were-botched-2008/ |title=Carbon 14 Dating On Shroud of Turin Were Botched 2008 &#124; Shroud of Turin Story |publisher=Shroudstory.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=September 2013}} Rogers also noted that the thread he examined contained a significant amount of cotton, and stated that cotton was absent in the main-body of the Shroud.<ref name="shroudstory.wordpress.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historian.net/shroud.htm |title=The Shroud of Turin |publisher=Historian.net |date=1989-02-16 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://greatshroudofturinfaq.com/Science/Dating/rogersmindchange.html |title=What caused Ray Rogers to change his mind about the carbon dating? |publisher=Greatshroudofturinfaq.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=September 2013}} In December 2010 Professor [[A.J. Timothy Jull|Timothy Jull]], a member of the original 1988 radiocarbon-dating team and editor of the peer-reviewed journal ''Radiocarbon'', coauthored an article with a textile expert in that journal. They examined a portion of the radiocarbon sample left over from the section used by the University of Arizona in 1988 for the carbon dating exercise, and found no evidence of a repair, nor of any dyes or other treatments. They concluded that the radiocarbon dating had been performed on a sample of the original shroud material.<ref>R.A. Freer-Waters, A.J.T. Jull, ''Investigating a Dated piece of the Shroud of Turin'', Radiocarbon, 52, 2010, pp. 1521-1527.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/objectviewer?o=http%3A%2F%2Fradiocarbon.library.arizona.edu%2FVolume52%2FNumber4%2F33737617-d6e4-4797-ba23-fb8e0f303abe |title=INVESTIGATING A DATED PIECE OF THE SHROUD OF TURIN |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-11-28}}</ref>

It has further been stated that Roger<U+2019>s vanillin-dating process is untested, and the validity thereof is suspect, as the deterioration of vanillin is heavily influenced by the temperature of its environment - heat strips away vanillin rapidly, and the shroud has been subjected to temperatures high enough to melt silver and scorch the cloth.<ref>Steven D.

===The sample was contaminated===
In 1993 Dr. Leoncio A. Garza-Valdes discovered the presence of [[polyhydroxyalkanoate]] (mcl-PHA)-producing bacteria ''[[Leobacillus rubrus]]'' on Shroud's fabric and confirmed their presence on three Egyptian mummies.<ref name="GV">{{cite web|url=http://www.shroud.com/latebra3.htm|title= A Christmas Letter from Dr. Garza-Valdes and an Update on his Work|publisher = Shroud.com |author= Leoncio A. Garza-Valdes|accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> According to Garza-Valdes, "the scientists that carried out the radiocarbon dating of the Shroud of Turin in 1988, were not aware of the presence of this unsuspected contaminant (natural plastic coating)". Garza-Valdes outlines further, that while studying thin sections from the Shroud fibers it was found that "more than 60% of the fibers' area is [[bioplastic]]".<ref name="GV"/> Pictorial evidence dating from c. 1690 and 1842<ref>Ian Wilson, ''The Blood and the Shroud''. New York: Free Press, 1998. ISBN 0-684-85359-0</ref> indicates that the corner used for the dating and several similar evenly spaced areas along one edge of the cloth were handled each time the cloth was displayed, the traditional method being for it to be held suspended by a row of five bishops. Wilson and others contend that repeated handling of this kind greatly increased the likelihood of contamination by bacteria and bacterial residue compared to the newly discovered archaeological specimens for which carbon-14 dating was developed. Bacteria and associated residue (bacteria by-products and dead bacteria) carry additional carbon-14 that would skew the radiocarbon date toward the present.

Professor Harry Gove, director of Rochester's laboratory (one of the laboratories not selected to conduct the testing), has also hypothesised that a <U+201C>bioplastic<U+201D> bacterial contamination, which was unknown during the 1988 testing, would render the tests inaccurate. He has however also acknowledged that the samples had been carefully cleaned with strong chemicals before testing.<ref>{{cite web | last = Meacham| first = William |  title = From the Proceedings of the Symposium "Turin Shroud - Image of Christ?"| date = 1 March 1986| url = http://www.shroud.com/meacham.htm|accessdate =14 April 2009 }}</ref>

STURP scientist Dr John Jackson has discounted the hypothesis that the sample was contaminated by more recent bioplastic residues from microbial action, on the basis that the samples were carefully cleaned first to eliminate this kind of contamination, and that the quantity of microbial mass required to skew the results would be significantly greater than the mass of the linen itself.<ref name="shroud.com">A New Radiocarbon Hypothesis; John P. Jackson, Ph.D.; Turin Shroud Center of Colorado; May 5, 2008; see at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/jackson.pdf</ref>

Rodger Sparks, a radiocarbon expert from New Zealand, had countered that an error of thirteen centuries stemming from bacterial contamination in the Middle Ages would have required a layer approximately doubling the sample weight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shroud.com/c14debat.htm |title=Debate of Roger Sparks and William Meacham on alt.turin-shroud |publisher=Shroud.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-12}}</ref> Because such material could be easily detected, fibers from the shroud were examined at the National Science Foundation Mass Spectrometry Center of Excellence at the University of Nebraska. Pyrolysis-mass-spectrometry examination failed to detect any form of bioplastic polymer on fibers from either non-image or image areas of the shroud. Additionally, laser-microprobe [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman]] analysis at Instruments SA, Inc. in Metuchen, New Jersey, also failed to detect any bioplastic polymer on shroud fibers.

Others have suggested that  the silver of the molten reliquiary and the water used to douse the flames may have catalysed the airborne carbon into the cloth.<ref>Moroni, M. & van Haelst, R. <U+2013> <U+2018>'Natural Factors Affecting the Apparent Radiocarbon Age of Textiles<U+2019><U+2019>.

Likewise proposed was a reaction with [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), a trace gas present in air, which it was claimed could add additional <U+201C>fresh<U+201D> C14 to the sample.<ref>Jull, A. J. T.; Donahue, D. J.; Damon, P. E., "Factors that affect the apparent radiocarbon age of textiles,"</ref> However carbon monoxide does not undergo significant reactions with linen which could result in an incorporation of a significant number of CO molecules into the cellulose structure.<ref>http://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/embed.php?File=shroud.html</ref>

The 2008 documentary ''Sindone, prove a confronto'' (lit., "The Shroud, comparing evidence") by David Rolfe suggested that the quantity of carbon 14 found on the weave may have been significantly affected by the weather, the conservation methods employed throughout the centuries,<ref>Chickos, J.S., and Uang, J. (2001). Chemical Modification of Cellulose.  The Possible Effects of Chemical Cleaning on Fatty Acids Incorporated in Old Textiles  (St. Louis MO, Department of Chemistry - University of Missouri-St. Louis).</ref> as well as the volatile carbon generated by the fire that damaged the shroud while in Savoy custody at [[Chamb<U+00E9>ry]]. Other theories include that  candle smoke (rich in carbon dioxide) and the volatile carbon molecules produced during the two fires may have altered the carbon content of the cloth, rendering carbon-dating unreliable as a dating tool.<ref>Brunati, E. - Note critiche sulla datazione della S.Sindone con il radiocarbonio - Typescript, Gennaio 1994, pp. 1-45.</ref><ref>Cardamone-Blacksburg, J. - La cellulosa dal lino; caratterizzazione e datazione - Typescript, Symposium Scientifique International de Paris sur le Linceul de Turin, 7-8 Septembre 1989, pp. 1-5.</ref>

===The calculations were done incorrectly===
In 1994, J. A. Christen applied a strong statistical test to the radiocarbon data and concludes that the given age for the shroud is, from a statistical point of view, correct.<ref>J.A.Christen, ''Summarizing a Set of Radiocarbon Determinations: a Robust Approach.'' Appl. Statist. 43, No. 3, 489-503 (1994)</ref>

However critics claim to have identified statistical errors in the conclusions published in ''Nature'':<ref name="Damon_Nature"/> including: the actual standard deviation for the Tucson study was 17 years, not 31, as published; the chi-square distribution value is 8.6 rather than 6.4, and the relative significance level (which measures the reliability of the results) is close to 1% - rather than the published 5%, which is the minimum acceptable threshold.<ref>Coghlan, A. - Unexpected errors affect dating techniques - New Scientist, Sept. 30, 1989, p. 26.</ref><ref>Ferrero, F.; Testore, F.; Malucelli, G., and Tonin, C.

Risultati di un modello probabilistico applicato alle ricerche eseguite sulla Sindone di Torino.</ref> None of these errors would however produce an altered dating supportive of a 1st Century manufacture.

In 2008 the director of the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, [[Christopher Ramsey]], told the BBC that "With the radiocarbon measurements and with all of the other evidence which we have about the Shroud, there does seem to be a conflict in the interpretation of the different evidence".<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7307646.stm</ref> Ramsey has stressed that he would be surprised if the 1988 tests were shown to be far off, let alone "a thousand years wrong", but said that he would keep an open mind.<ref>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1579810/Fresh-tests-on-Shroud-of-Turin.html</ref>

==Books discussing the carbon-dating==
There are two books with detailed treatment of the Shroud's carbon dating, including not only the scientific issues but also the events, personalities and struggles leading up to the sample taking. The books offer opposite views on how the dating should have been conducted, and both are critical of the methodology finally employed.

In ''Relic, Icon or Hoax? Carbon Dating the Turin Shroud'' (1996; ISBN 0-7503-0398-0), Harry Gove provides an account of the interaction between Prof Carlos Chagas, chairman of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and Cardinal Ballestrero, with Gove and Gonella. He provides a detailed record of meetings, telephone conversations and correspondence.

''The Rape of the Turin Shroud'' by William Meacham (2005; ISBN 1-4116-5769-1) devotes 100 pages to the carbon dating. Meacham is also highly critical of STURP and Gonella, and also of Gove. He describes the planning process from a very different perspective (both he and Gove were invited along with 20 other scholars to a conference in Turin in 1986 to plan the C-14 protocol) and focuses on what he claims was the major flaw in the dating: taking only one sample from the corner of the cloth. Meacham reviews the main scenarios that have been proposed for a possibly incorrect dating, and claims that the result is a "rogue date" because of the sample location and anomalies. He points out that this situation could easily be resolved if the Church authorities would simply allow another sample to be dated, with appropriate laboratory testing for possible embedded contaminants.
