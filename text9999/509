The '''Shawangunk Grasslands National Wildlife Refuge''' is a [[wildlife refuge]] located in [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]], [[New York]], [[USA]].
Formerly the '''Galeville Military Airport''', it was decommissioned in 1994 and turned over to the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] in 1999. It serves as a waypoint for grassland-dependent migratory birds.

==History==

The {{convert|565|acre|ha|adj=on}} refuge first became federal property in the early 1940s, when the [[United States Army|Army]] bought what was then [[swamp]]land and [[Fill dirt|filled]] it in with soil from the nearby [[flood plain]]s to build an [[airport|airbase]] to [[flight training|train pilots]] as a result of [[World War II]].<ref name="history">{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/northeast/shawangunk/history.htm|title=History |accessdate=2007-07-18 |work=Shawangunk Grasslands National Wildlife Refuge}}</ref> It stopped using the base years after the war, in the early 1970s and in later years it would be used by the nearby [[United States Military Academy]]. [[FBI]] agents also trained there.<ref name="PoJo">Rothbaum, Rebecca; June 20, 2002; "[http://cityguide.pojonews.com/fe/DayTrips/stories/dt_shawangunk_grasslands.asp Wildlife lives on in Shawangunk Grasslands]"; ''[[Poughkeepsie Journal]]''; retrieved July 18, 2007.</ref> as did the [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals Service]].<ref name="CCP 3-6">CCP, 3-6. "The recent past of the refuge has included a history as a farm field,
use as an airport, and a role as a training location for U. S. Marshals."</ref> 

In 1994 the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] decided it no longer needed the property. Five years later, it was conveyed to the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] (FWS), which had wanted to protect the land as one of the state's top ten areas for grassland-dependent migratory birds. It is today managed as a subunit of the [[Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge]], {{convert|35|mi|km}} to the south.

Recently the FWS has begun to [[mowing|mow]] and deshrub the {{convert|350|acre|ha}} that make up the refuge's core grasslands. This prevents the grasslands from returning to wooded swamp.<ref name="management">{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/northeast/shawangunk/management.htm |title=Grassland Management|publisher=[[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]]|accessdate=2007-07-18|work=Shawangunk Grasslands National Wildlife Refuge|quote=...[T]he refuge has marshaled significant resources to mow, brush-hog, and Hydro-Ax the refuge's primary grassland area to restore and maintain a grass-dominated plant community.}}</ref>

==Geography==

The Shawangunk Grasslands National Wildlife Refuge is situated in the central portion of the town, closer to the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Hamlet|hamlet]] of [[Wallkill, Ulster County, New York|Wallkill]] than [[Walker Valley, New York|Walker Valley]]. It is a roughly rectangular parcel that sits slightly west of the [[Wallkill River]], just north of the crest of the [[water divide|divide]] between it and its [[tributary]] [[Shawangunk Kill]], itself a relatively unspoiled stream and important habitat the FWS has been working to protect.<ref name="USFWS Shawangunk Kill">[http://training.fws.gov/library/pubs5/web_link/text/sha_kill.htm#Shawangunk%20Kill Shawangunk Kill], U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, retrieved from training.fws.gov, July 21, 2007. "The Shawangunk Kill is a relatively undisturbed Hudson River tributary. Its low nutrient levels, cool water, and lack of a major water control structure allow the lower Shawangunk Kill to support a regionally rare biological community."</ref> The site is roughly bounded by Hoagerburgh Road (Ulster County 18) on the west, Albany Post Road (Ulster County 9) on the east, Long Lane (Ulster County 18A) on the north and Bates Lane to the south. Public access is provided near the southwest corner, off Hoagerburgh.

The central area of the property, the former airport, is bounded on all sides by woodland and shrubland (except for a small corridor around the main public access road) which makes up 165 acres (66 ha) of the total. The 400 acres (160 ha) that account for the core grassland also boast the former airport's 3,500-foot<U+2013>long (1,067 m) [[runway]]s and equivalent [[taxiway]]s, taking up about 30 acres (12 ha) along the southern and western bounds of the grasslands. From this open space, it is possible to see the [[Shawangunk Ridge]] to the west.

==Geology==

Like much of the [[Hudson Valley]], the Shawangunk Grasslands show the signs of [[glacier|glaciation]] during [[Wisconsin glaciation|the last Ice Age]], even though they were created much more recently through human action. The [[topsoil]] in the grasslands contains a high level of [[clay]], which forms a barrier to most water filtering downward. Throughout the entire refuge, the [[water table]] is at least 3 feet (1 m) below the surface. Frequent freezing and melting during the winter results in pit-and-[[hummock]] [[topography]] throughout much of the refuge.<ref name="CCP 3-8"/>

==Ecology and biology==
The grasslands created by the airport's construction are one of only two such locations in the region that can support the 12 species of birds dependent on them. Some of them, according to the FWS, need at least {{convert|10|<U+2013>|20|acre}}, per nesting pair.<ref name="PoJo" /> Over 140 bird species, 58 of which breed there, have been documented in the refuge, including .<ref name="CCP 3-15">CCP, 3-15. "More than 141 species of birds, including 58 breeding species, have been documented."</ref>

===Fauna===
The Shawangunk Grasslands are especially important to these grassland-dependent species:<ref name="history" />

* [[Bobolink]]
* [[Eastern meadowlark]]
* [[Grasshopper sparrow]]
* [[Horned lark]]
* [[Northern harrier]]
* [[Savannah sparrow]]
* [[Short-eared owl]]
* [[Upland sandpiper]]

In addition several [[hawk]] and [[falcon]] species (not grassland-dependent) have been seen at the site,<ref name="CCP 3-17">CCP, 3-17.</ref> and [[black-billed cuckoo]] and [[wood thrush]] have been nesting in the woodland portions.<ref name="CCP 4-19">{{PDFlink|[http://library.fws.gov/CCPs/SG-Final/Chapter4.pdf CCP Chapter 4: Management Direction and Implementation]|805&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 825165 bytes -->}}, 4-19; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, retrieved July 17, 2007. "136 acres of the refuge are composed of woodland or shrubland in transition to woodland, which cannot be converted effectively to grassland habitat. Black-billed cuckoo and wood thrush are declining species that nest in these small woodland patches."</ref> Non-bird species that have settled into the habitat include several [[turtle]] species, [[smallmouth bass|small-mouthed bass]] and [[Centrarchidae|sunfish]] in the one small pond on the site<ref name="CCP 3-14">CCP, 3-14.</ref> and [[white-tailed deer]] in the woodlands.

The FWS has also been alerted to the possibility that [[Indiana bat]]s, a federal [[endangered species]], may be exploiting opportunities provided by the refuge. A [[hibernaculum (zoology)|hibernaculum]] of 30,000 bats has been reported {{convert|18|mi}} to the northeast, and there is evidence that some have roosted closer to the refuge. The agency has been monitoring the refuge to see if any Indiana bats have begun to use dead trees as [[roost]]ing sites or begin to [[foraging|forage]] on the site.<ref name="CCP 3-11, 3-12">CCP, 3-11, 3-12. "However, in August 2005 we learned from our Ecological Service<U+2019>s New York Field Office that a hibernaculum of 30,000 Indiana bats (''Myotis sodalis''), a Federal endangered species, lies in Ulster County 18 miles to the northeast of the refuge. In addition, there is documented summer roosting by these bats nine miles to the north and south of the refuge. This new information indicates that the refuge could provide potential roosting and foraging habitat for these bats since they appear to be in the vicinity ... We will continue to work with our New York Field Office to obtain the latest information on where bats are located, and to assess the implications to our refuge management."</ref>

[[Image:laka-panorama.jpg|thumb|left|Shawangunk Grasslands in summer]]

===Flora===
While the refuge is protected primarily for the bird life, several rare or uncommon [[plant]] species have also been found in the grasslands, where [[Kentucky bluegrass]] is the dominant species<ref name="CCP 4-14">CCP, 4-14. "Approximately 400 acres of the refuge is composed of grassland dominated by Kentucky bluegrass."</ref> [[Frank's sedge]], [[small-flowered agrimony]], [[purple milkweed]], [[small white aster]], [[Bush's sedge]], [[coontail]] and [[watermeal]].<ref name="CCP 3-12">CCP, 3-12. "Stevens documented one of the most noteworthy, Frank's sedge (''Carex frankii''), which is ranked endangered by the NYSDEC and S1 by the New York Natural Heritage Program (NYNHP) (Stevens 1992). Stevens also documented small-flowered agrimony (''Agrimonia parviflora''), purple milkweed (''Asclepias purpurascens''), small white aster (''Aster vimineus''), Bush's sedge (''Carex bushii''), coontail (''Ceratophyllum echinatum''), and watermeal (''Wolffia brazilinsis'').</ref> A few tree species, such as [[white ash]], [[American elm]], [[eastern red cedar]], and [[pin oak]], also flourish in those sections. The woodlands on the periphery are dominated by several oak species, [[red maple]], [[sugar maple]], [[shagbark hickory]] and [[tulip tree]]s.<ref name="CCP 3-14" />

The grasslands have also been inviting for several [[invasive species]], most notably [[purple loosestrife]], [[goldenrod]] and [[gray dogwood]]. FWS's mowing and other grassland-preservation efforts are aimed at removing or controlling those species.<ref name="CCP 3-14" />

==Management==

In 2002, the Fish and Wildlife Service finished its first final Comprehensive Conservation Plan for the Shawangunk Grasslands. Its primary goal in managing the area is to preserve and, where possible, extend the existing grassland.<ref name="CCP 4-10">CCP, 4-10. "Our goal will be to create a diverse mosaic of grassland habitat structure capable of sustaining the full complement of grassland-dependent birds during all seasons. We will manage the various grassland structural types (short, medium, tall) as a shifting mosaic over time. We will also increase the available grasslands by up to 30 acres through the restoration of the asphalt and concrete runways and taxiways."</ref> By mowing, deshrubbing and continuing to work with local farmers who are allowed to [[grazing|graze]] animals on the land and [[hay]] it under special use permits, it hopes to maintain a diverse enough selection of grasses for all species.<ref name="CCP 4-10<U+2013>4-15">CCP, 4-10 through 4-15.</ref> Similarly, one mature tree per 10 acres (4 ha) of grassland will be maintained for predatory bird species.<ref name="CCP 4-16">CCP, 4-16. "In the mosaic of grasslands, maintain scattered mature trees (1 tree /10 ac) for wintering raptor hunting and roosting perches."</ref>
[[Image:Shawangunk Grasslands NWR runways 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Abandoned runway, already slowly returning to grassland. Yellow cross indicates to aircraft that the airport is officially closed.]]
In the longer term, FWS plans to create up to 30 acres (12 ha) of additional grassland by removing the runway [[Pavement (material)|pavement]] and restoring the original cover. An 8-foot (2 m) wide strip of [[concrete]] would be left for use as a public [[trail]]. While grasses are already beginning to grow through cracks in the runways, the agency would prefer not to wait as aircraft continue to make illegal landings at the refuge, disturbing the birds, despite markings on the runways themselves and on aviation charts of the area indicating that the facility is closed. It has not yet determined how this will be done in the most environmentally sensitive fashion.<ref name="CCP 4-17, 4-18">CCP, 4-17 and 4-18. "Altering the pavement is also an essential step to eliminating illegal landings and low-altitude overflights
by small airplanes, which are highly disturbing to breeding birds. The current sectional aeronautical chart for the area indicates that the runways on the refuge are closed, and markings on the runways communicate this closure to pilots flying overhead ... We have not fully developed our restoration plan as we continue to explore
options for recycling the asphalt and concrete.</ref> Similarly, it hopes to restore the original stream pattern through the property by removing the [[culvert]]s and other reroutings made during construction of the airfield.<ref name="CCP 4-20, 4-21">CCP, 4-20, 4-21.</ref>
[[Image:Shawangunk Grasslands NWR woodlands.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Some of the woodlands at the edge of the refuge.]]
Since the woodlands surrounding the grasslands cannot be converted into grasslands, FWS will maintain them as such. The 26 acres (10 ha)<ref name="CCP 3-14" /> of grass and shrublands within the woods, which also have become important habitat, will be allowed to return to woodland.<ref name="CCP 4-19" />

FWS has also committed itself to exploring a number of ways to control the invasive plant species in the refuge, such as [[herbicide]]s, releasing [[beetle]] and [[weevil]] species that feed on the invaders and [[controlled burn]]s in addition to the methods it already employs. Its goal is to reduce their presence to less than 10% of the refuge within 10 years.<ref name="CCP 4-20, 4-21" />

Some of its employees have expressed concerns about whether any pollutants might be left over from previous military use of the site, particularly around a communications center demolished in 1973. While the agency does not presently believe there is any cause for concern, it will be monitoring the situation and plans an environmental assessment.<ref name="CCP 4-20, 4-21" />

===Partner organizations===

The FWS has credited other organizations, public and private, with helping it to fulfill its goals for the refuge. The former is represented by its state-level counterpart, the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] (NYSDEC), which has shared data with it, participated in the planning process and works with local communities to protect wildlife habitat. Among the latter, the local and state [[Audubon Society]] chapters advocated strongly for the area's protection, since the society had declared the airport site an Important Bird Area in 1998.<ref name="CCP, 3-9, 10">CCP, 3-9, 10.</ref><ref name="Audubon IBA">{{cite web |url=http://iba.audubon.org/iba/viewSiteProfile.do?siteId=807&navSite=state |title=Site Profile: Shawangunk Grasslands |publisher=[[Audubon Society]] |accessdate=July 21, 2007 |format= |work= }}.</ref> Other organizations have played supporting roles by helping to perform management tasks and raising awareness. There is as yet no Friends of Shawangunk Grasslands National Wildlife Refuge as there is at other refuges, but FWS would like for one to be formed.<ref name="CCP, 3-9, 10" /> A few local residents have begun keeping an eye on the refuge of their own accord.<ref name="Steward of the Grasslands">{{cite news|last=Hall|first=Wayne|title=Wayne's World: Steward of the Grasslands|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080203/NEWS/802030315|publisher=[[Ottaway Community Newspapers]]|work=[[Times-Herald Record]]|date=February 3, 2008|accessdate=May 29, 2009}}</ref>
[[Image:SGNWR public entrance.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The existing public access point and parking lot, which FWS would like to expand.]]

==Recreation==

While the refuge is easily accessible to the public, activities within it are strictly limited to those that are wildlife-dependent: walking, [[nature photography]], [[birdwatching]] and, in winter, [[snowshoe]]ing and [[cross-country skiing]]. [[Jogging]] is not allowed, nor is any activity that would bring other animals (such as dogs or horses) or motorized vehicles into the area, since that would likely disturb the nesting birds.<ref name="CCP 4-5">CCP, 4-5. "We will continue to prohibit the walking of pets, jogging, bicycling, riding horses, driving all-terrain vehicles, model airplane flying and competitions, and the touching down, taking off, or acrobatic flying of aircraft on the refuge ... We have observed the activity disturbing wildlife to a greater degree than impacts generated from visitors who's {{sic}} purpose is to watch or photograph wildlife"</ref> All visitors must remain on the paved roads or runways.<ref name="CCP 3-17" /> The refuge is open from one hour before sunrise to one hour after sunset year-round.<ref name="CCP, 4-9">CCP, 4-9. "We will open the refuge for public use from 1 hour before official sunrise to 1 hour after official sunset, seven days a week, to ensure visitor safety and protect refuge resources."</ref>

Among the motorized vehicles banned from the refuge are [[radio-controlled aircraft]]. Model airplane enthusiasts, who took to the site and its abandoned runways before it was transferred to FWS, had hoped to continue to be allowed to do so under its management. Many of them wrote in with public comments favoring their hobby, saying wild birds and model airplanes could indeed coexist as they had for 30 years of model aviation at the former airport.<ref name="RCCR newsletter">{{PDFlink|[http://www.drchristine.com/rccr/news/0203.pdf Airflow, March-April 2002 issue of newsletter of the Radio Control Club of Rochester]|417&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 427216 bytes -->}}, retrieved July 21, 2007.</ref> While eventually 90% of the comments that addressed it supported model airplaning, FWS did not believe that it was compatible with the goal of preserving a safe habitat for the birds, and officially banned it.

FWS was also criticized by [[animal rights]] groups<ref name="IDA page">{{cite web |url=http://ga0.org/indefenseofanimals/alert-description.html?alert_id=4123062 |title=Stop Bow Hunting in National Wildlife Refuge |accessdate=2007-07-21 |format= |work= }}</ref> for its decision to allow [[bowhunting]] of deer on the refuge during the state season in the fall, the only hunting it decided was compatible with the refuge's mission. Most bowhunters, it responded, will be using [[tree stand]]s on the perimeter and will only need to enter the site briefly to retrieve any kills.<ref name="Comments and responses">{{PDFlink|[http://library.fws.gov/CCPs/SG-Final/AppendixI.pdf Appendix I: Summary and Response to Public Comments]}}, retrieved July 23, 2009.</ref> It will be administered under a special fee permit system.

Currently, the agency estimates the refuge receives about 5,500 visitors a year, contributing $257,840 to the local economy. The FWS also makes annual [[revenue sharing]] payments to the town at various amounts between $2<U+2013>3,000 a year.<ref name="CCP 3-8" /> Most visitors have been birdwatchers, many drawn by the chance to watch the short-eared owl, one of the few owls that hunt in daylight.<ref name="owl hunt">{{cite news |first=Wayne |last=Hall |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Wintering owls take to the skies at dusk |url=http://archive.recordonline.com/archive/2004/12/18/wayne18.htm |work= |publisher=''[[Times-Herald Record]]'' |date=December 28, 2004|accessdate=2007-07-21 }}</ref> Ultimately the agency hopes to provide a more complete trail system, possibly connecting to an adjacent {{convert|55|acre|ha|adj=on}} town park and allowing better wildlife viewing. It would like to expand the current parking area and provide an interior contact point for the public, with one employee at the refuge at all times.<ref name="CCP maps and pages">CCP, maps 4-1 and 4-2, pages 4-11, 12.
