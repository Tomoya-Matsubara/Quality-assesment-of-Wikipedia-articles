'''Vedda language''' is a language used by the [[indigenous people|indigenous]] [[Vedda]] people of [[Sri Lanka]]. Communities that do not identify themselves strictly as Veddas such as [[Coast Veddas]] and [[Anuradhapura Veddas]] also use Vedda language in part for communication during hunting and or for religious chants. A systematic field study was conducted in 1959 and then the language was confined to the older generation of Veddas from [[Dambana]]. In 1990's self identifying Veddas knew few words and phrases in Vedda language but there were individuals who knew the language comprehensively. Initially there was considerable debate amongst [[linguists]] as to whether Vedda is a dialect of Sinhalese or an independent language. Later studies indicate that it diverged from its parent stock in the 10 century ACE and became a [[Creole]] and a stable independent language by the 13 century ACE under the influence from [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]]. The parent Vedda language(s) is of unknown genetic origins while Sinhalese is of [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] sub family origin. [[Phonology|Phonologically]] it is distinguished from Sinhalese by the higher frequency of [[palatal]] sounds C and J. The effect is also heightened by the addition of inanimate suffixes. Morphologically Vedda language word class is divided in to [[nouns]], [[verbs]] and invariables with unique gender distinctions in animate nouns. Per its Creole tradition, it has reduced and simplified many forms of Sinhalese such as second person [[pronouns]] and denotations of negative meanings. Instead borrowing new words from Sinhalese or other languages Vedda language creates combinations of words from a limited lexical stock. Vedda also maintains many archaic Sinhalese terms from the 10 to 12 century ACE , as a relict of its close contact with Sinhalese. Vedda language also retains number of words that are unique to it and cannot be derived from Sinhalese. Sinhalese has also borrowed from the original Vedda language, words and grammatical structures differentiating it from its related Indo-Aryan languages. Vedda language has exerted a [[substratum]] influence in the formation Sinhalese.    

==History==
{{Vedda language}} Ancestors of Veddas migrated to Sri Lanka via the Indian sub continent during the pre-historic period. A number of [[Mesolithic]] sites have been excavated containing human remains dated to 28,000 BCE.<ref>{{Harvnb|Indrapala|2007|pages=28,64}}</ref>Anthropologists consider these skeletal remains to belong to a group ancestral to some of the surviving Vedda groups.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blundell|2006|page=165}}</ref> There are also [[Megalithic]] burial sites, which were excavated at [[Kathiraveli]] and [[Pomparippu]] dated to 10 century BCE.<ref>{{Harvnb|Indrapala|2007|pages=74-76}}</ref><ref group="note">Pre historic Sri Lanka experienced an intrusive early Iron Age (EIA) cultural diffusion from [[South India]] prior to the recorded arrival of Prakrit language speakers in 5th century BCE. The EIA is dated to 10th century BCE and is associated with the megalithic burial cultures of Pomparippu and other locations. Its counter part is found in the Southern [[Tamil Nadu]] region of India. Associated with the EIA culture are introduction of domesticated horse, iron implements, megalithic burial practices such as urn burials and tank based paddy cultivation.  It is unknown as to the language(s) used by this EIA culture.</ref> It is unknown as to the languages spoken by these early human populations of Sri Lanka prior to its settlement by [[Prakrit]] language speaking Indian immigrant groups in the 5th century BCE. Linguists have tried to link these early Vedda languages to [[Dravidian languages]], [[Munda languages]] or an altogether independent language families.<ref name=I45/><ref>{{Harvnb|Indrapala|2007|pages=70-71}}</ref> The Sinhalese term Vedda is a generic term denoting hunter gatherers without any connotations as to ethnic affiliations. In Tamil they are known as Vedar denoting a hunter. Similar terms are used throughout [[South India]] to describe primitive hunter gatherers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Van Driem|2002|page=217}}</ref> Sri Lanka has had other communities in the early history associated with tribal and hunting gathering life styles. (See [[Rodiya]], [[Kinnaraya]] and [[Rodiya language]])<ref name=V242/><ref>{{Harvnb|International Labour Office |1953|page=190}}</ref>

The earliest account of the Vedda language was written by Ryklof Van Goens (1663-1675) who served as a Director General of the [[Dutch East India Company]]  in Sri Lanka. He wrote that their language was much closer to Sinhalese than [[Tamil language|Tamil]].<ref name=v218>{{Harvnb|Van Driem|2002|page=218}}</ref> [[Robert Knox]] an Englishman held captive by [[Kandyan Kingdom|Kandyan king]], wrote in 1681 that the wild and settled Veddas spoke the language of the Sinhalese people. [[Portuguese people|Portuguase]] friar [[Fernao de Queroz]] wrote a nuanced description of the Vedda language in 1686, that the language was not mutually intelligible with the native languages.<ref name=v222>{{Harvnb|Van Driem|2002|page=222}}</ref>  [[Robert Percival]] wrote in 1803 that the Veddas although seemingly speaking a broken dialect of Sinhalese, amongst themselves speak a language that is only known to them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Van Driem|2002|page=219}}</ref> But in John Davies in 1831 wrote that the Veddas spoke a language that was understood by the Sinhalese except a few words. These discrepancies in observations were clarified by Charles Pridham who wrote in 1848 that the Veddas knew a form of Sinhalese that they were able to use to talk to outsiders but to themselves they spoke in a language although influenced mostly by Sinhalese and Tamil that was only understood by them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Van Driem|2002|page=223}}</ref>

The first systematic attempt at studying the Vedda language was undertaken by Hugh Neville, an English civil servant in [[British Ceylon]]. He founded the Taprobanian, a quarterly journal devoted to the study of everything Ceylonese. He speculated based on [[etymology|etymological]] studies that the Vedda language is based on Old Sinhalese form called [[Hela]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Van Driem|2002|page=225}}</ref>  This was followed by Parker who wrote that most Vedda language words were borrowed from Sinhlaese but he also noted words of unique origin that he assigned to the original language of the Veddas.<ref>{{Harvnb|Van Driem|2002|page=226}}</ref> The second most important study was made by [[Wilhem Geiger]] in 1935 who also sounded the alarm that the Vedda language would be soon be extinct and needs to be studied in detail.<ref name=V227>{{Harvnb|Van Driem|2002|page=227}}</ref> One of the linguists to head to that call was [[Manniku W. Sugathapala De Silva]] who did a compressive study of the language in 1959. He went to on get his PhD on that thesis as well published a book on that hypothesis.<ref name=V227-8>{{Harvnb|Van Driem|2002|pages=227-228}}</ref> according to him, the language was restricted to the older geneartion of people from the [[Dambanna]] region with younger generation shifting to Sinhalese. Where as [[Coast Veddas]] speak a [[dialect]] of [[Sri Lankan Tamil dialect|Sri Lankan Tamil]] that is used in the region. During religious festivals, people who enter a [[trance]] or [[spirit possession]] sometimes use a mixed language that contains words from the Vedda language.<ref name=S73>{{Harvnb|Samarasinghe|1990|page=73}}</ref><ref group="note">Vedars or Coast Veddas consider themselves and are considered by the [[Sri Lankan Tamils]] as a caste (''kulam'' or ''jati'' in Tamil), rather than an ethnic group.  Nevertheless there is considerable debate amongst Vedars and their Tamil neighbors to their status within the caste system, Vedars claiming very high status and their neighbors assigning somewhat lower status. Vedars use the [[Sri Lankan Tamil dialects|Sri Lankan Tamil dialect]] peculiar to that region called Batticaloa Tamil dialect in their day to day conversations. Vedar children also study in that language in schools. But during religious (''Sadangu'' in Tamil) ceremonies, those who are possessed by spirits speak in a mixed language that they call ''Vedar Sinkalam''(Vedar Sinhala") or ''Vedar Bhasai'' ("Vedar langugage")which is Vedda language of the interior Vedas. ''Vedar Sinkalam'' is mixed with many Tamil words, as people no longer know the language. At some point in the past that the people were [[bilingual]] in Vedda language and Tamil, but that is no longer the case.</ref> Veddas of the [[Anuradhapura]] region speak in Sinhalese, but use Vedda language to denote animals during hunting trips.<ref name=V242>{{Harvnb|Van Driem|2002|page=242}}</ref><ref group="note">In the late 1800<U+2019>s, Veddas of Anuradhapura did not identify themselves as Veddas to Parker and other British ethnologists. They self identified themselves as Vanniyas or people of the forest. But to James Brow an anthropologists who studied then in 1970<U+2019>s they readily identified themselves as Veddas. Parker recorded number of hunting terms used by the Vanniyas that were similar to what the Veddas of Bintanne region used as part of their Vedda language.</ref>

==Classification==       
Early linguists and observers of the language considered it to be either a separate language or a dialect of Sinhalese. The chief proponent of the dialect theory was Wilhem Geiger but he also contradicted himself by claiming that Veddas was a [[Relexification |reflexified]] aboriginal language.<ref name=V227/> The first comprehensive study of the language was undertaken by Manikku W. Sugathapala de Silva in 1959, he along with K. N. O Dharmadasa have put forward the view that Vedda language is a Creole. According to De Silva, Vedda language is a [[Creole language|Creole]] based on the original Vedda language with Sinhalese as the second most important contributing factor which is supported by Geiger view that Vedda  is a relexified aboriginal language.<ref name=V227/> De Silva concluded that although the Creole had borrowed profusely from Sinhalese vocabulary, its morphology was very distinct.<ref name=V227/> He also concluded that Vedda language still contains in its vocabulary terms that was unknown to the Sinhalese. He wrote that grammatically Vedda remained still distinct from Sinhalese.<ref name=v229/> In 1990 K.N.O Dharmadasa wrote that irrespective claims about whether the Vedda form in use in the 1990s is an independent language or a Creole, the peculiarities of the language made it still a distinct linguistic form different from all varieties of Sinhalese 

According to De Silva and Dharmadasa, when the colonization of island by various Indian settlers using common [[Prakrit]]s in use in India began in 5th century BCE, some elements of the Vedda coalesced with the settlers and lost their language through [[language replacement]].<ref name=D74>{{Harvnb|Dharmadasa|1974|page=74}}</ref>  Where as more conservative elements maintaining a [[hunter gatherer]] lifestyle moved into the central highlands known in early literature as ''[[Malaya Rata]]''. Most Indian settlers colonized the North, Northwestern, Eastern and South Eastern lowlands of the country leaving the heavily forested central high lands to the ancestors of Veddas.<ref name=D74/> With the collapse of the lowland dry zone civilization starting in the 9th century, descendants of the Indian settlers who had begun to speak Sinhalese moved in the central highlands. The trade and other connections made by the speakers of completely different languages such as Sinhalese and Vedda language(s) unknown genetic affinities gave rise to a period of  use of a [[Pidgin]] of the languages. <ref name=D74/>  There were borrowings of limited number of terms related trade and eventually daily life by the elites of the Vedda from Sinhalese that was eventually adopted the rest of the Veddas. The Veddas also seemed to have moved further way from Sinhalese contact by moving into inaccessible forests of [[Binttanne]] and now reforested former dry zone areas. This led to the arresting of the contact between the language communities thus allowing new Vedda language to stabilize and become an independent language. As a relict of this limited period of contact, Vedda language maintains many archaic Sinhalese words that were in vogue during that period. These words have gone out of use in contemporary Sinhalese. Veddas consider the Vedda language to be distinct from Sinhalese and use it as an ethnic marker to differentiate them from Sinhalese people.<ref name=D81>{{Harvnb|Dharmadasa|1974|page=81}}</ref>

===Vedda Grammar===
[[File:Important locations of Anuradhapura Kingdom.png|thumb|The refuge of the Vedda language(s) in [[Malaya Rata]] or Central Highlands untill the fall of Dry zone civilization starting in 9th century ACE, also the crucible of later Vedda Creole development from 10 to 12 century ACE.<ref name=D96>{{Harvnb|Dharmadasa|1974|page=96}}</ref>.]] In Sinhalese indicative sentences are negated by adding a negative particle to the emphatic form of the verb where as Vedda, the negative particle is added to the infinite.  In Sinhalese all indicative sentences whether negative or affirmative, exhibits two tenses <U+2013> past and non past but in Vedda a three term tense system is used in affirmative sentences but not in negative. Sinhalese pro nouns have number distinction but Vedda does not have number distinction. The Vedda verbal and nominal inflexions are similar to Sinhalese but are not identical. Vedda also exhibits a gender classification in inanimate and animate nouns.<ref name=v229/>

==Phonology==
Although phonemic inventory Vedda is very similar to Sinhalese, but in phonotactics it<U+2019>s is very dissimilar to Sinhalese. The usage of palatal affricates c (sounds similar to ch in Church) and J (sounds similar to J in Judge) is very high in Vedda language. Some comparisons

{| class="wikitable"
!English !! Sinhalese !! Vedda
|-
|earlier || issara || iccara 
|-
|}<ref name=S87>{{Harvnb|Samarasinghe|1990|page=87}}</ref>


This effect is heightened by the addition of inanimate suffixes such as pojja, gejja or raacca. These suffixes are used in tandem with borrowings from Sinhalese.

|-
|weight || bara || barapojja
|-
|eye || asa || ajjejja
|-
|head || isa || ijjejja
|-
|water || watura/diya|| diyaracca
|}<ref name=S87/>

These transformations are very similar to what we see in other Creole languages like [[Melanesian Pidgin English]] and [[Jamaican English Creole]].<ref name=D81>{{Harvnb|Dharmadasa|1974|page=81}}</ref> The preponderance of the palatal affricates is explained as a left over from days when the original Vedda language which had a high frequency of such phonemes.<ref name=D82>{{Harvnb|Dharmadasa|1974|page=82}}</ref>

==Morphology==
Formerly distinct Vedda nouns have two types of suffixes, one for animate and another for inanimate. 
===Animate nouns===
The animate suffixes are <U+2013>atto for personal pronouns and <U+2013>''laatto'' for all other animate nouns and - pojja and -''raaccaa'' for personified nouns.  Examples are 

*deyyalaato (god)
*pannilaatto (worm)
*meeatto( I or we)
*irapojja (sun)
*giniraaccaa (fire)

These suffixes are also used in singular and plural meaning based from the verbal and non verbal context. 

#''botakandaa nam puccakaduvaa huura '''meeatto''''' (Sir, '''I''' killed the elephant though)
#'''''meeattanne''' kiriamilaatto kalaapojjen mangaccana kota eeattanne badapojje kakulek randaala indatibaala tibenava'' (When '''our''' great grandmother was walking in the forest there was a child conceived in that one<U+2019>s womb.)

the dependance on verbal (and non verbal) context for semantic specification, which is accomplished by inflectional devices by natural languges is an indication of a contact languge.

certain words that appear to be from original Vedda language do not have these suffixes, also animate nouns also have gender distinctions, with small animals treated as feminine (''i'' marker) and larger ones masculine (''a'' marker)

*botakanda (elephant)
*kankunaa (deer)
*karia (bear)
*hatera (bear)
*okma (buffalo)
*kandaarni (bee)
*mundi (monitor lizard)
*potti (bee)
*makini (spider)
*ikini (louse)<ref name=v229>{{Harvnb|Van Driem|2002|page=229}}</ref>

===Inanimate nouns===
Inanimate nouns use suffixes such as <U+2013>''rukula'' and <U+2013>''danda'' with nouns denoting body parts and other suffixes such as ''-pojja, -tana, and -gejja''. Suffixes are used when the words are borrowed from Sinhalese.

*ayrukula (eye)
*ugurudanda (throat)
*veedipojja (street)
*kirigejja (coconut)
*kavitana (verse)
*giniracca (fire)<ref name=S88>{{Harvnb|Samarasinghe|1990|page=88}}</ref>

There are number of forms that are from the original Vedda language that dont have suffixes such as 

*galrakki (axe)
*caalava (pot)
*bucca (bush)

Vedda inanimate nouns are formed by borrowing Sinhalese adjectives and adding a suffix. Kavi is Sinhalese adjective for Kaviya the noun but where as Vedda noun is kavi(tana).

===Pronouns===
Examples of pronouns are ''meeatto'' (I), ''topan'' (you), ''eyaba'' (there), ''koyba'' (where?). Compared to Sinhalese which requires five forms to address people based on status, Vedda uses one (''topann'') irrpective of status. These pronouns are also used in both singular and plural denotations.

===Numerals===
These are found in definite and indefinite forms. ''ekama'' one (def.) and ''ekamak'' once (indef.) They count ekamay, dekamay and tunamay. Vedda language also reduces the numer formations found in Sinhalese.

|-
|two things  || dekak || dekamak
|-
|twice || deparak || dekamak
|-
|}<ref name=S92>{{Harvnb|Samarasinghe|1990|page=92}}</ref>

===Negation===
Another example of simplication in Veddais minimisations of neagtive meanings found in Sinhalese

{| class="wikitable"
!Sinhalese !! Vedda 
|-
|naa || koduy 
|-
|epaa  || koduy 
|-
|baa || koduy
|-

|-
|nattaN || koduy
|-
|bari|| koduy 
|-
|}<ref name=D88>{{Harvnb|Dharmadasa|1974|page=88}}</ref>

==Lexicon==
Many of the Vedda words are directly borrowed from Sinhalese or Tamil via Sinhalese while maintaining words that are not derivable from Sinhalese or its cognate languages from the Indo-Aryan language group. Vedda also exhibits a propensity for paraphrases and it coins words from its limited lexical stock rather than to borrow words from other languages including Sinhalese. For example
{| class="wikitable"
!Sinhalese !! Vedda || English
|-
|nava || maadiyanganalle dandDukacca (vehicle of the ocean) || ship
|-
| vassa || uDatanin mandovena diyaracca (water falling from above) || rain
|-
|tuvakkuva (loan from [[Turkish]]) || puccakazDana yamake (shooting thing) || gun
|-
|upadinava || baDapojjen mangaccanvaa (come from the belly)|| to be born
|-
|padura || vaterena yamake (sleeping thing) || bed
|-
|pansala (loan from [[English]]) || kurukurugaccana ulpojja (spike making kuru kuru sound) || pencil
|-
|}<ref name=S96>{{Harvnb|Samarasinghe|1990|page=96}}</ref>
===Archaic terms===
Vedda maintains in its lexicon Archaic Sinhalese words that are no longer in daily usage. These archaic words are attested from classical Sinhalese prose from the 10th century until the 13 century, the purported period of close contact between the original Vedda language(s) and Old Sinhala leading to the development of the Creole. Some examples are 

*''devla'' in Vedda means Sky but a 10 century Sinhalese exegetical work called ''Dhampia Atuva Getapadaya'', it is used in the meaning of cloud.

*''diyamaccca'' in Vedda meaning fish is similar to ''diyamas'' found in a 10th century monastic work called ''Sikhavalanda''.

*''manda'' in Vedda means near or with. This word is attested in the 12 century eulogy called ''Butsarana''.

*''koomantana'' meaning wearing apparel is similar to the Sinhalese word ''Konama'' found in the 13 century work ''Ummagga Jatakaya'' alternatively ''komanam'' in Tamil is a [[loincloth]], a cloth worn by early Veddas.<ref name=D923>{{Harvnb|Dharmadasa|1974|pages=92-93}}</ref>

==Substratum influence in Sinhalese==
According to Geiger, Sinhalese language has features that set<U+2019>s apart from other Indo-Aryan languages. Some of the differences can be explained by the substrate influence of parent stock of the Vedda language.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gair|1998|page=4}}</ref> Sinhalese has many words that are only found in Sinhalese or it is shared between Sinhalese and Vedda language and cannot be etymologically derived from Middle or Old Indo-Aryan.  Common examples are ''Kola'' in Sinhalese and Vedda for leaf, ''Dola'' in Sinhalese for Pig and offering in Vedda. Other common words are ''Rera'' for wild duck and ''Gala'' for stones in [[Toponyms]] found throughout the island.<ref name=v230>{{Harvnb|Van Driem|2002|page=230}}</ref> There are also high frequency words denoting body parts in Sinhalese such s ''Olluva'' for head, ''Kakula'' for leg, ''bella'' for neck and ''kalava'' for thighs that are derived from pre-Sinhalese languages of Sri Lanka.<ref name=I45>{{Harvnb|Indrapala|2007|page=45}}</ref>The author of the oldest Sinhalese grammar, ''Sidatsangarava,'' written in the 13th century ACE have recognized a category of words that exclusively belonged to early Sinhalese. It lists ''naramba'' (to see) and ''kolamba'' (ford or habor) as belonging to an indigenous source. ''Kolamba'' is the source of the name of the commercial capital [[Colombo]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Indrapala|2007|page=70}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Gair|1998|page=5}}</ref>
