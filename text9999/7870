The [[avante garde]] '''Alien<U+00B3> score''' was written for the motion picture of the [[Alien<U+00B3>|same name]], scored by [[Elliot Goldenthal]], it was his first big mainstream score; he described it as an experiment and spent a whole year creating it.<ref>[http://www.movie-wave.net/titles/alien3.html Goldenthal: Alien 3<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Goldenthal's work for Alien<U+00B3> is widely considered one of his most intensely inventive, visceral, influential works and indeed, by many listeners, to be his best;<ref>[http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/review.asp?ID=291 Alien 3 - Music from the Movies<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Goldenthal himself cites the score as one of his stand-out soundtracks.<ref>[http://www.filmtracks.com/composers/goldenthal.shtml Filmtracks: Elliot Goldenthal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

Even though the score is generally considered a [[magnum opus]] it is also considered to be the case that most of the cues are quite "dissonant" and "bleak" for a casual movie score listener and, more, one for the aficionado.<ref>[http://www.soundtrack-express.com/osts/alien3.htm Alien 3 - Elliot Goldenthal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.movie-wave.net/titles/alien3.html Goldenthal: Alien 3<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
