The '''Bund der Asienk<U+00E4>mpfer''' (BdAK), more rarely mentioned as '''Bund Deutscher Asienk<U+00E4>mpfer''' (BDAK), meaning "League of Asian Warriors" or "League of German Asian Warriors", was a [[Social welfare provision|social welfare]] organization for German veterans who had been in the [[Asia Korps|Asien-Korps]], the units of the [[German Empire]] at the service of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Near East]] and the [[Balkans]] during [[World War I]].

The BdAK was established in 1918, at the end of the war, by German ex-armymen. One of their main purposes was to investigate what had happened to entire missing German units of the Asien-Korps, including German nurses ([[German Red Cross|German Red Cross Sisters]]), when the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Palestine-Transjordan]] front collapsed at the end of September 1918. At that time many Germans fighting along Turkish troops in the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] suddenly found themselves behind enemy lines, fighting for their lives.

This association issued a magazine, the "Orient Rundschau," during its heyday, which was during the 1920s, until well into the Nazi time. In the name of [[Gleichschaltung]], the Bund der Asienk<U+00E4>mpfer was affiliated to the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] after the [[Machtergreifung|Nazi takeover of power]] in 1933. It was finally disbanded by the Nazi authorities in 1938.
