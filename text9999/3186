'''''Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly''''' is an anti-[[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] novel by American author [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. Published in 1852, the novel "helped lay the groundwork for the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]", according to Will Kaufman.<ref>''The Civil War in American Culture'' by Will Kaufman, Edinburgh University Press, 2006, page 18.</ref>

Stowe, a [[Connecticut]]-born teacher at the Hartford Female Academy and an active [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]], featured the character of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering black slave around whom the stories of other characters revolve. The [[sentimental novel]] depicts the reality of slavery while also asserting that Christian love can overcome something as destructive as enslavement of fellow human beings.<ref name="Sparknotes">''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' by Harriet Beecher Stowe, Spark Publishers, 2002, p. 19, states the novel is about the "destructive power of slavery and the ability of Christian love to overcome it..."</ref><ref name="CompleteIdiot">''The Complete Idiot's Guide to American Literature'' by Laurie E. Rozakis, Alpha Books, 1999, p. 125, says one of the book's main messages is that "The slavery crisis can only be resolved by Christian love."</ref><ref name="Domestic Abolitionism">''Domestic Abolitionism and Juvenile Literature, 1830<U+2013>1865'' by Deborah C. de Rosa, SUNY Press, 2003, p. 121, De Rosa quotes Jane Tompkins that Stowe's strategy was to destroy slavery through the "saving power of Christian love." This quote is from [http://web.princeton.edu/sites/english/NEH/TOMPKINS.HTM "Sentimental Power: Uncle Tom's Cabin and the Politics of Literary History"] by Jane Tompkins, from ''In Sensational Designs: The Cultural Work of American Fiction'', 1790<U+2013>1860. New York: Oxford UP, 1985. Pp. 122<U+2013>146. In that essay, Tompkins also writes, "Stowe conceived her book as an instrument for bringing about the day when the world would be ruled not by force, but by Christian love."</ref>

== Sources ==
Stowe, a [[Connecticut]]-born teacher at the Hartford Female Academy and an active [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]], wrote the novel as a response to the 1850 passage of the second [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]]. Much of the book was composed in [[Brunswick, Maine]], where her husband, [[Calvin Ellis Stowe]], taught at his alma mater, [[Bowdoin College]].

[[Image:StowePainting.jpg|thumb|upright|left|An [[engraving]] of [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] from 1872, based on an oil painting by [[Alonzo Chappel]]]]

Stowe was partly inspired to create ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' by ''[[The Life of Josiah Henson, Formerly a Slave, Now an Inhabitant of Canada, as Narrated by Himself]]'' the 1849 [[slave narrative]] of [[Josiah Henson]], a former enslaved black man who had lived and worked on a {{convert|3700|acre|km2}} tobacco [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] in [[North Bethesda, Maryland]], owned by Isaac Riley.<ref name=Logue>Susan Logue, [http://www.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2006-01-13-voa58.html "Historic Uncle Tom's Cabin Saved"], VOA News, January 12, 2006. Retrieved December 24, 2011.</ref> Henson escaped slavery in 1830 by fleeing to the [[Upper Canada|Province of Upper Canada]] (now [[Ontario]]), where he helped other fugitive slaves settle and become self-sufficient, and where he wrote his memoirs. Stowe acknowledged in 1853 that Henson's writings inspired ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''.<ref>Harriet Beecher Stowe, [http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/uncletom/key/kyhp.html ''A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin''] 1853, p. 42, in which Stowe states "A last instance parallel with that of Uncle Tom is to be found in the published memoirs of the venerable Josiah Henson]..." This also is cited in ''A Routledge Literary Sourcebook on Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin'' by Debra J. Rosenthal, Routledge, 2003, pages 25<U+2013>26.</ref> When Stowe's work became a best-seller, Henson republished his memoirs as ''The Memoirs of Uncle Tom'' and traveled on lecture tours extensively in the United States and Europe.<ref name=Logue/> Stowe's novel lent its name to Henson's home<U+2014>[[Uncle Tom's Cabin Historic Site]], near [[Dresden, Ontario]]<U+2014>which since the 1940s has been a museum.

''[[American Slavery As It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses]]'', a volume co-authored by [[Theodore Dwight Weld]] and the [[Grimk<U+00E9> sisters]], is also a source of some of the novel's content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/we/Weld-The.html|title=Weld, Theodore Dwight|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090225213915/http://www.bartleby.com/65/we/Weld-The.html|archivedate=February 25, 2009|accessdate=May 15, 2007}}The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2001<U+2013>2005.</ref> Stowe said she based the novel on a number of interviews with people who escaped slavery during the time when she was living in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio, across the [[Ohio River]] from [[Kentucky]], a slave state. In Cincinnati the [[Underground Railroad]] had local abolitionist sympathizers and was active in efforts to help runaway slaves on their escape route from the South.

Stowe mentioned a number of the inspirations and sources for her novel in ''[[A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1853). This non-fiction book was intended to verify Stowe's claims about slavery.<ref name="UTCKey">[http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/uncletom/key/kyhp.html A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive. Retrieved April 20, 2007.</ref> However, later research indicated that Stowe did not read many of the book's cited works until after she had published her novel.<ref name="UTCKey"/>

== Publication ==
''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' first appeared as a 40-week serial in ''[[National Era]]'', an abolitionist periodical, starting with the June 5, 1851, issue. Because of the story's popularity, the publisher [[John Jewett]] contacted Stowe about turning the serial into a book. While Stowe questioned if anyone would read ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' in book form, she eventually consented to the request.

Convinced the book would be popular, Jewett made the unusual decision (for that time) to have six full-page illustrations by [[Hammatt Billings]] engraved for the first printing.<ref>[http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/uncletom/illustra/52illf.html First Edition Illustrations], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive. Retrieved April 18, 2007.</ref> Published in book form on March 20, 1852, the novel soon sold out its complete print run. A number of other editions were soon printed (including a deluxe edition in 1853, featuring 117 illustrations by Billings).<ref>[http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/uncletom/illustra/53illf.html Illustrations for the "Splendid Edition"], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive. Retrieved April 18, 2007.</ref>

In the first year of publication, 300,000 copies of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' were sold. At that point, however, "demand came to an unexpected halt... No more copies were produced for many years, and if, as is claimed, [[Abraham Lincoln]] greeted Stowe in 1862 as 'the little woman who wrote the book that made this great war,' the work had effectively been out of print for many years." Jewett went out of business, and it was not until [[Ticknor and Fields]] put the work back in print in November 1862 that demand began again to increase.<ref>Michael Winship, "[http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/interpret/exhibits/winship/winship.html Uncle Tom's Cabin: History of the Book in the 19th-Century United States]."</ref>

The book was translated into all major languages, and in the United States it became the second best-selling book after the Bible.<ref name=bookrags/> A number of the early editions carried an introduction by [[James Sherman (minister)|Rev James Sherman]], a [[Congregational church|Congregational]] minister in London noted for his abolitionist views. ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' sold equally well in Britain, with the first London edition appearing in May 1852 and selling 200,000 copies.<ref name=pbs-4p2958/> In a few years over 1.5 million copies of the book were in circulation in Britain, although most of these were [[copyright infringement|pirated]] copies (a similar situation occurred in the United States).<ref>"publishing, history of."

== Plot ==
=== Eliza escapes with her son, Tom sold "down the river" ===
[[Image:ElizaEngraving.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Full-page illustration by [[Hammatt Billings]] for ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' depicts Eliza telling Uncle Tom that he has been sold and she is running away to save her child. (First Edition: Boston: [[John P. Jewett and Company]], 1852).]] 

The book opens with a [[Kentucky]] farmer named Arthur Shelby facing the loss of his farm because of debts. Even though he and his wife Emily Shelby believe that they have a benevolent relationship with their slaves, Shelby decides to raise the needed funds by selling two of them<U+2014>Uncle Tom, a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of Emily Shelby<U+2019>s maid Eliza<U+2014>to a slave trader. Emily Shelby is averse to this idea because she had promised her maid that her child would never be sold; Emily's son, George Shelby, hates to see Tom go because he sees the man as his friend and mentor.

When Eliza overhears Mr. and Mrs. Shelby discussing plans to sell Tom and Harry, Eliza determines to run away with her son. The novel states that Eliza made this decision because she fears losing her only surviving child (she had already [[miscarriage|miscarried]] two children). Eliza departs that night, leaving a note of apology to her mistress.

Tom is sold and placed on a [[riverboat]] which sets sail down the [[Mississippi River]]. While on board, Tom meets and befriends a young white girl named Eva. Eva's father Augustine St. Clare buys Tom from the slave trader and takes him with the family to their home in New Orleans. Tom and Eva begin to relate to one another because of the deep Christian faith they both share.

=== Eliza's family hunted, Tom's life with St. Clare ===
[[Image:TomEva.jpg|thumb|250px|Illustration of Tom and Eva by Hammatt Billings for the 1853 deluxe edition of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin.'']]

During Eliza's escape, she meets up with her husband George Harris, who had run away previously. They decide to attempt to reach Canada. However, they are tracked by a slave hunter named Tom Loker. Eventually Loker and his men trap Eliza and her family, causing George to push Loker down a cliff. Worried that Loker may die, Eliza convinces George to bring the slave hunter to a nearby [[Quaker]] settlement for medical treatment.

Back in New Orleans, St. Clare debates slavery with his Northern cousin Ophelia who, while opposing slavery, is prejudiced against black people. St. Clare, however, believes he is not biased, even though he is a slave owner. In an attempt to show Ophelia that her views on blacks are wrong, St. Clare purchases Topsy, a young black slave. St. Clare then asks Ophelia to educate her.

After Tom has lived with the St. Clares for two years, Eva grows very ill. Before she dies she experiences a vision of [[heaven]], which she shares with the people around her. As a result of her death and vision, the other characters resolve to change their lives, with Ophelia promising to throw off her personal prejudices against blacks, Topsy saying she will better herself, and St. Clare pledging to free Tom.

=== Tom sold to Simon Legree ===
Before St. Clare can follow through on his pledge, however, he dies after being stabbed outside of a tavern. His wife reneges on her late husband's vow and sells Tom at auction to a vicious plantation owner named Simon Legree. Legree (a transplanted northerner) takes Tom to rural [[Louisiana]], where Tom meets Legree's other slaves, including Emmeline (whom Legree purchased at the same time). 

[[Image:CassyTom.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Full page illustration by Hammatt Billings for ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' (First Edition: Boston: John P. Jewett and Company, 1852). Cassy, another of Legree's slaves, is shown ministering to Uncle Tom after his whipping.]]

Legree begins to hate Tom when Tom refuses Legree's order to whip his fellow slave. Legree beats Tom viciously and resolves to crush his new slave's faith in God. Despite Legree's cruelty, however, Tom refuses to stop reading his Bible and comforting the other slaves as best he can. While at the plantation, Tom meets Cassy, another of Legree's slaves. Cassy was previously separated from her son and daughter when they were sold; unable to endure the pain of seeing another child sold, she killed her third child.

At this point Tom Loker returns to the story. Loker has changed as the result of being healed by the Quakers. George, Eliza, and Harry have also obtained their freedom after crossing into Canada. In Louisiana, Uncle Tom almost succumbs to hopelessness as his faith in God is tested by the hardships of the plantation. However, he has two visions, one of Jesus and one of Eva, which renew his resolve to remain a faithful Christian, even unto death. He encourages Cassy to escape, which she does, taking Emmeline with her. When Tom refuses to tell Legree where Cassy and Emmeline have gone, Legree orders his overseers to kill Tom. As Tom is dying, he forgives the overseers who savagely beat him. Humbled by the character of the man they have killed, both men become Christians. Very shortly before Tom's death, George Shelby (Arthur Shelby's son) arrives to buy Tom<U+2019>s freedom but finds he is too late.

=== Final section ===
On their boat ride to freedom, Cassy and Emmeline meet George Harris' sister and accompany her to Canada. Cassy discovers that Eliza is her long-lost daughter who was sold as a child. Now that their family is together again, they travel to France and eventually [[Liberia]], the African nation created for former American slaves. George Shelby returns to the Kentucky farm and frees all his slaves. George tells them to remember Tom's sacrifice and his belief in the true meaning of Christianity.

== Major characters ==
=== Uncle Tom ===
{{main|Uncle Tom}}
[[Image:legree.png|thumb|Simon Legree assaults Uncle Tom]]

Uncle Tom, the title character, was initially seen as a noble, long-suffering Christian slave. In more recent years, however, his name has become an epithet directed towards African-Americans who are accused of [[selling out]] to whites. Stowe intended Tom to be a "noble hero"<ref name="NobleHero">''A Routledge Literary Sourcebook on Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin'' by Debra J. Rosenthal, Routledge, 2003, page 31.</ref> and praiseworthy person. Throughout the book, far from allowing himself to be exploited, Tom stands up for his beliefs and is grudgingly admired even by his enemies.

=== Eliza ===
Eliza is a slave and personal maid to Mrs. Shelby who escapes to the North with her five-year old son Harry after he is sold to Mr. Haley. Her husband, George, eventually finds Eliza and Harry in [[Ohio]] and emigrates with them to Canada, then France and finally Liberia.

The character Eliza was inspired by an account given at [[Lane Theological Seminary]] in Cincinnati by [[John Rankin (abolitionist)|John Rankin]] to Stowe's husband Calvin, a professor at the school. According to Rankin, in February 1838 a young slave woman had escaped across the frozen [[Ohio River]] to the town of [[Ripley, Ohio|Ripley]] with her child in her arms and stayed at his house on her way further north.<ref>Hagedorn, Ann. ''Beyond The River: The Untold Story of the Heroes of the Underground Railroad''. Simon & Schuster, 2002, pp. 135<U+2013>139.</ref>

===Eva===
[[File:Edwin Longsden Long - Uncle Tom and Little Eva.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Little Eva and Uncle Tom by [[Edwin Longsden Long]]]]

Evangeline St. Clare is the daughter of Augustine St. Clare. Eva enters the narrative when Uncle Tom is traveling via [[steamship]] to New Orleans to be sold, and he rescues the 5 or 6 year-old girl from drowning. Eva begs her father to buy Tom, and he becomes the head coachman at the St. Clare house. He spends most of his time with the angelic Eva.
Eva often talks about love and forgiveness, even convincing the dour slave girl Topsy that she deserves love. She even touches the heart of her Aunt Ophelia. 

Eventually Eva falls [[terminal illness|terminally ill]]. Before dying, she gives a lock of her hair to each of the slaves, telling them that they must become Christians so that they may see each other in [[Heaven]]. On her deathbed, she convinces her father to free Tom, but because of circumstances the promise never materializes.

A similar character, also named '''Little Eva''', later appeared in the [[Children's literature|children's novel]] ''[[Little Eva: The Flower of the South]]'' by Philip J. Cozans (although this ironically was an [[Anti-Tom literature|anti-Tom novel]]).

=== Simon Legree ===
[[File:CC No 15 Uncle Toms Cabin.jpg|thumb|Simon Legree on the cover of the comic book adaptation of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' (''Classic Comics'' No. 15, November 1943 issue).]]

Simon Legree is a cruel slave owner<U+2014>a Northerner by birth<U+2014>whose name has become synonymous with greed. He is arguably the novel's main [[antagonist]]. His goal is to demoralize Tom and break him of his religious faith; he eventually orders Tom whipped to death out of frustration for his slave's unbreakable belief in God. The novel reveals that, as a young man, he had abandoned his sickly mother for a life at sea and ignored her letter to see her one last time at her deathbed. He sexually exploits Cassy, who despises him, and later sets his designs on Emmeline.

It is unclear if Legree is based on any actual individuals. Reports surfaced after the 1870s that Stowe had in mind a wealthy cotton and sugar plantation owner named [[Meredith Calhoun]], who settled on the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] north of [[Alexandria, Louisiana]]. Generally, however, the personal characteristics of Calhoun ("highly educated and refined") do not match the uncouthness and brutality of Legree. Calhoun even edited his own newspaper, published in [[Colfax, Louisiana|Colfax]], originally "Calhoun's Landing", renamed the ''National Democrat'' after Calhoun's death. However, Calhoun's overseers may have been in line with the hated Legree's methods and motivations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/articles/n2ar19dvt.html|title=J.E. Dunn, "About Uncle Tom's Cabin: A Louisianian Says Meredith Calhoun Was Not a Model for Legree, August 31, 1896|publisher=utc.iath.virginia.edu|accessdate=December 23, 2010}}</ref>

== Other characters ==
There are a number of secondary and minor characters in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''. Among the more notable are:

* '''Arthur Shelby''' <U+2013> Tom's master in Kentucky. Shelby is characterized as a "kind" slaveowner and a stereotypical Southern gentleman.
* '''Emily Shelby''' <U+2013> Arthur Shelby's wife. She is a deeply religious woman who strives to be a kind and moral influence upon her slaves and is appalled when her husband sells his slaves with a slave trader. As a woman, she has no legal way to stop this, as [[coverture|all property belongs to her husband]].
* '''George Shelby''' <U+2013> Arthur and Emily's son, who sees Tom as a friend and as the perfect Christian.
* '''Augustine St. Clare''' <U+2013> Tom's second owner and father of Eva. Clare is complex, often sarcastic, with a ready wit. After a rocky courtship he marries a woman he grows to hold in contempt, though he is too polite to let it show. St. Clare recognizes the evil in chattel slavery but is not willing to relinquish the wealth it brings him. After his daughter's death he becomes more sincere in his religious thoughts and starts to read the Bible to Tom. He plans on finally taking action against slavery by freeing his slaves, but his good intentions ultimately come to nothing.

[[File:Topsy and Eve, by John R. Neill.jpg|thumb|Little Eva and Topsy by [[John R. Neill]], 1908]]

* '''Topsy''' <U+2013> A ragamuffin young slave girl. When asked if she knows who made her, she professes ignorance of both God and a mother, saying "I s'pect I growed. Don't think nobody never made me." She is transformed by Eva's love. During the early-to-mid 20th century, several doll manufacturers created Topsy and Topsy-type dolls. The phrase "growed like Topsy" (later "grew like Topsy"; now somewhat archaic) passed into the English language, originally with the specific meaning of unplanned growth, later sometimes just meaning enormous growth.<ref>[http://www.word-detective.com/052003.html The Word Detective], issue of May 20, 2003, accessed February 16, 2007.</ref>
* '''Miss Ophelia''' <U+2013> Augustine St. Clare's pious, hard-working, abolitionist cousin from Vermont. She displays the ambiguities towards African-Americans felt by many Northerners at the time. She argues against the institution of slavery yet, at least initially, feels repulsed by the slaves as individuals.
* '''Quimbo and Sambo''' <U+2013> slaves of Simon Legree who act as overseers of the plantation. On orders from Legree, they savagely whip Tom but afterward tearfully repent of their deeds to Tom, who forgives them as he lies dying.

== Major themes ==
''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' is dominated by a single theme: the evil and immorality of slavery.<ref>''Homelessness in American Literature: Romanticism, Realism, and Testimony'' by John Allen, Routledge, 2004, page 24, where it states in regards to ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' that "Stowe held specific beliefs about the 'evils' of slavery and the role of Americans in resisting it." The book then quotes Ann Douglas describing how Stowe saw slavery as a sin.</ref> While Stowe weaves other subthemes throughout her text, such as the moral authority of motherhood and the redeeming possibilities offered by Christianity,<ref name="CompleteIdiot"/> she emphasizes the connections between these and the horrors of slavery. Stowe sometimes changed the story's voice so she could give a "[[homily]]" on the destructive nature of slavery<ref>''Drawn With the Sword: Reflections on the American Civil War'' by James Munro McPherson, Oxford University Press, 1997, page 30.</ref> (such as when a white woman on the steamboat carrying Tom further south states, "The most dreadful part of slavery, to my mind, is its outrages of feelings and affections<U+2014>the separating of families, for example.").<ref>''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' by Harriet Beecher Stowe, Vintage Books, Modern Library Edition, 1991, page 150.</ref> One way Stowe showed the evil of slavery<ref name=pbs-4p2958/>  was how this "peculiar institution" forcibly separated families from each other.<ref>''Drawn With the Sword: Reflections on the American Civil War'' by James Munro McPherson, Oxford University Press, 1997, page 29.</ref>

[[Image:FugitivesSafe.jpg|thumb|left|300px|"The fugitives are safe in a free land." Illustration by Hammatt Billings for ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', First Edition. The image shows George Harris, Eliza, Harry, and Mrs. Smyth after they escape to freedom.]]

Because Stowe saw motherhood as the "ethical and structural model for all of American life"<ref>"Stowe's Dream of the Mother-Savior: Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Women Writers Before the 1920s" by Elizabeth Ammons, ''New Essays on Uncle Tom's Cabin'', Eric J. Sundquist, editor, Cambridge University Press, 1986, page 159.</ref> and also believed that only women had the moral authority to save<ref>''Whitewashing Uncle Tom's Cabin: Nineteenth-Century Women Novelists Respond to Stowe'' by Joy Jordan-Lake, Vanderbilt University Press, 2005, page 61.</ref> the United States from the demon of slavery, another major theme of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' is the moral power and sanctity of women. Through characters like Eliza, who escapes from slavery to save her young son (and eventually reunites her entire family), or Eva, who is seen as the "ideal Christian",<ref>''Somatic Fictions: imagining illness in Victorian culture'' by Athena Vrettos, Stanford University Press, 1995, page 101.</ref> Stowe shows how she believed women could save those around them from even the worst injustices. While later critics have noted that Stowe's female characters are often [[Domestic worker|domestic]] [[clich<U+00E9>]]s instead of realistic women,<ref>''The Stowe Debate: Rhetorical Strategies in Uncle Tom's Cabin'' by Mason I.

These genres were the most popular novels of Stowe's time and tended to feature female main characters and a writing style which evoked a reader's sympathy and emotion.<ref>[http://www.wsu.edu/~campbelld/amlit/domestic.htm "Domestic or Sentimental Fiction, 1820<U+2013>1865"] American Literature Sites, [[Washington State University]].

Retrieved April 26, 2007.</ref> The power in this type of writing can be seen in the reaction of contemporary readers.

I could not leave it any more than I could have left a dying child."<ref>''Reading Women: Literary Figures and Cultural Icons from the Victorian Age to the Present'' by Janet Badia and Jennifer Phegley, University of Toronto Press, 2005, page 67.</ref> Another reader is described as obsessing on the book at all hours and having considered renaming her daughter Eva.<ref name="ReadingWomen">''Reading Women: Literary Figures and Cultural Icons from the Victorian Age to the Present'' by Janet Badia and Jennifer Phegley, University of Toronto Press, 2005, page 66.</ref> Evidently the death of Little Eva affected a lot of people at that time, because in 1852, 300 baby girls in Boston alone were given that name.<ref name="ReadingWomen" />

Despite this positive reaction from readers, for decades [[literary critic]]s dismissed the style found in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and other sentimental novels because these books were written by women and so prominently featured "women's sloppy emotions."<ref name="IntroTompkinsEssay">''A Routledge Literary Sourcebook on Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin'' by Debra J.

New York: Oxford UP, 1985. Pp. 122<U+2013>146.</ref> 

However, in 1985 Jane Tompkins expressed a different view of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' with her book ''In Sensational Designs: The Cultural Work of American Fiction.''<ref name="IntroTompkinsEssay"/> Tompkins praised the style so many other critics had dismissed, writing that sentimental novels showed how women's emotions had the power to change the world for the better. She also said that the popular domestic novels of the 19th century, including ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', were remarkable for their "intellectual complexity, ambition, and resourcefulness"; and that ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' offers a "critique of American society far more devastating than any delivered by better-known critics such as [[Nathaniel Hawthorne|Hawthorne]] and [[Herman Melville|Melville]]."<ref name="JaneTompkins"/>

This view remains the subject of dispute. Writing in 2001, legal scholar [[Richard Posner]] described ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' as part of the mediocre list of canonical works that emerges when political criteria are imposed on literature.<ref>Posner, R.: ''Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline'', page 239, Harvard University Press (2002), ISBN 067400633X.</ref>

== Reactions to the novel ==
''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' has exerted an influence equaled by few other novels in history.<ref>[[Hollis Robbins]], [http://www.gilderlehrman.org/historynow/06_2008/historian2.php ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and the Matter of Influence"], Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History. Retrieved December 24, 2011.</ref> Upon publication, ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' ignited a firestorm of protest from defenders of slavery (who created a number of books in response to the novel) while the book elicited praise from abolitionists. As a best-seller, the novel heavily influenced later protest literature.

=== Contemporary and world reaction ===
''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' outraged people in the [[American South]].<ref name=pbs-4p2958>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2958.html Slave narratives and Uncle Tom's Cabin], Africans in America, PBS, accessed February 16, 2007.</ref> The novel was also roundly criticized by slavery supporters.

Acclaimed Southern novelist [[William Gilmore Simms]] declared the work utterly false,<ref>"Simms's Review of Uncle Tom's Cabin" by Charles S. Watson, American Literature, Vol. 48, No. 3 (November, 1976), pp. 365<U+2013>368</ref> while others called the novel criminal and slanderous.<ref>"Over and above ...

Ridgely, American Literature, Vol. 31, No. 4 (January, 1960), pp. 421<U+2013>433.</ref>

Some critics highlighted Stowe's paucity of life-experience relating to Southern life, saying that it led her to create inaccurate descriptions of the region.{{Clarify| reason=The thesis statement beginning this paragraph notes critics said the writer was inexperienced in direct contradiction with the following "supporting" examples. The linking phrases make it seem like a big chunk of text has been hewn away.| date=April 2012}} For instance, she had been to a Southern plantation. However, Stowe always said she based the characters of her book on stories she was told by runaway slaves in Cincinnati. It is reported that "She observed firsthand several incidents which galvanized her to write [the] famous anti-slavery novel. Scenes she observed on the Ohio River, including seeing a husband and wife being sold apart, as well as newspaper and magazine accounts and interviews, contributed material to the emerging plot."<ref>[http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg149.htm The Classic Text: Harriett Beecher Stowe.] University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Library.

[[File:Stowe-Key-cover.jpg|thumb|left|''A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin'', first edition cover, 1853]]

In response to these criticisms, in 1853 Stowe published ''[[A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', an attempt to document the veracity of the novel's depiction of slavery. In the book, Stowe discusses each of the major characters in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and cites "real life equivalents" to them while also mounting a more "aggressive attack on slavery in the South than the novel itself had."<ref name="UTCKey"/> Like the novel, ''A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin'' was also a best-seller. However, while Stowe claimed ''A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin'' documented her previously consulted sources, she actually read many of the cited works only after the publication of her novel.<ref name="UTCKey"/>  A major part of the ''Key'' was Stowe's critique of how the legal system supported slavery and licensed owners' mistreatment of slaves.  Thus, Stowe put more than slavery on trial; she put the law on trial.  This continued an important theme of Uncle Tom's Cabin <U+2013> that the shadow of law brooded over the institution of slavery and allowed owners to mistreat slaves and then avoid punishment for their mistreatment.  In some cases, as Stowe pointed out, it even prevented kind owners from freeing their slaves.<ref>[http://blurblawg.typepad.com/files/stowe.pdf Alfred L. Brophy, "Over and above ... There Broods a Portentous Shadow,<U+2014>The Shadow of Law: Harriet Beecher Stowe's Critique of Slave Law in Uncle Tom's Cabin," Journal of Law and Religion, Vol. 12, No. 2 (1995<U+2013>1996): 457<U+2013>506].</ref>

Despite these criticisms, the novel still captured the imagination of many Americans. According to Stowe's son, when [[Abraham Lincoln]] met her in 1862 Lincoln commented, "So this is the little lady who started this great war."<ref name=CEStowe/> Historians are undecided if Lincoln actually said this line, and in a letter that Stowe wrote to her husband a few hours after meeting with Lincoln no mention of this comment was made.<ref name=Claybaugh>''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', introduction by Amanda Claybaugh, Barnes and Noble Classics, New York, 2003, page xvii.</ref> Since then, many writers have credited this novel with focusing Northern anger at the injustices of slavery and the Fugitive Slave Law<ref name=Claybaugh/> and helping to fuel the abolitionist movement.<ref name="abolitionism2001"/> [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[General officer|general]] and politician [[James Baird Weaver]] said that the book convinced him to become active in the abolitionist movement.<ref>"Review of James Baird Weaver by Fred Emory Haynes" by A. M. Arnett, Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 35, No. 1 (March, 1920), pp. 154<U+2013>157; and [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAweaverJ.htm profile of James Baird Weaver], accessed February 17, 2007.</ref> 

''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' also created great interest in the United Kingdom. The first London edition appeared in May 1852 and sold 200,000 copies.<ref name=pbs-4p2958/> Some of this interest was because of British antipathy to America. As one prominent writer explained, "The evil passions which ''Uncle Tom'' gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance [of slavery], but national jealousy and national vanity. We have long been smarting under the conceit of America <U+2013> we are tired of hearing her boast that she is the freest and the most enlightened country that the world has ever seen. Our clergy hate her voluntary system <U+2013> our [[Tory|Tories]] hate her democrats <U+2014> our [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] hate her [[parvenu]]s <U+2013> our [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]] hate her litigiousness, her insolence, and her ambition. All parties hailed Mrs. Stowe as a revolter from the enemy."<ref>Nassau Senior, quoted in [[Ephraim Douglass Adams]], ''Great Britain and the American Civil War'' (1958) p: 33.</ref> [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]], the American minister to Britain during the war, argued later that "''Uncle Tom's Cabin''; or ''Life among the Lowly'', published in 1852, exercised, largely from fortuitous circumstances, a more immediate, considerable and dramatic world-influence than any other book ever printed."<ref>Charles Francis Adams, ''Trans-Atlantic Historical Solidarity: Lectures Delivered before the University of Oxford in Easter and Trinity Terms, 1913.'' 1913. p. 79</ref>

The book has been translated into almost every language, including Chinese (with translator [[Lin Shu]] creating the first Chinese translation of an American novel) and [[Amharic language|Amharic]] (with the 1930 translation created in support of [[Ethiopia]]n efforts to end the suffering of blacks in that nation).<ref>Richard Pankhurst, ''Economic History of Ethiopia'' (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University Press, 1968), p. 122.</ref> The book was so widely read that [[Sigmund Freud]] reported a number of patients with [[Sadism and masochism as medical terms|sado-masochistic]] tendencies who he believed had been influenced by reading about the whipping of slaves in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''.<ref>Ian Gibson, ''The English Vice: Beating, Sex and Shame in Victorian England and After'' (1978)</ref>

New York: Oxford University Press, 1986. See chapter five, "Sentimental Power: ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and the Politics of Literary History."</ref> ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' greatly influenced development of not only [[American literature]] but also protest literature in general. Later books which owe a large debt to ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' include ''[[The Jungle]]'' by [[Upton Sinclair]] and ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by [[Rachel Carson]].<ref>''The Cambridge Companion to Harriet Beecher Stowe'' by Cindy Weinstein, Cambridge University Press, 2004, page 13.</ref>

Despite this undisputed significance, ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' has been called "a blend of children's [[fable]] and propaganda."<ref name="The Nation">[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20061225/wellington "Uncle Tom's Shadow"] by Darryl Lorenzo Wellington, ''The Nation'', December 25, 2006.</ref> The novel has also been dismissed by a number of [[literary critics]] as "merely a sentimental novel,"<ref name="literature123"/> while critic George Whicher stated in his ''Literary History of the United States'' that "Nothing attributable to Mrs. Stowe or her handiwork can account for the novel's enormous vogue; its author's resources as a purveyor of Sunday-school fiction were not remarkable. She had at most a ready command of broadly conceived melodrama, humor, and pathos, and of these popular sentiments she compounded her book."<ref name="JaneTompkins"/>

Other critics, though, have praised the novel. [[Edmund Wilson]] stated that "To expose oneself in maturity to Uncle Tom's Cabin may ... prove a startling experience."<ref name="The Nation"/> Jane Tompkins states that the novel is one of the classics of American literature and wonders if many literary critics aren't dismissing the book because it was simply too popular during its day.<ref name="JaneTompkins"/>

Over the years scholars have postulated a number of theories about what Stowe was trying to say with the novel (aside from the obvious themes, such as condemning slavery). For example, as an ardent Christian and active abolitionist, Stowe placed many of her religious beliefs into the novel.<ref>[[James H. Smylie|Smylie, James H.]] "''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' Revisited: the Bible, the Romantic Imagination, and the Sympathies of Christ." ''American Presbyterians'' 1995 73(3): 165<U+2013>175. Issn: 0886-5159.</ref> Some scholars have stated that Stowe saw her novel as offering a solution to the moral and political dilemma that troubled many slavery opponents: whether engaging in prohibited behavior was justified in opposing evil. Was the use of violence to oppose the violence of slavery and the breaking of proslavery laws morally defensible? Which of Stowe's characters should be emulated, the passive Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris?<ref name="Bellin">Bellin, Joshua D. "Up to Heaven's Gate, down in Earth's Dust: the Politics of Judgment in Uncle Tom's Cabin" ''American Literature'' 1993 65(2): 275<U+2013>295. Issn: 0002-9831 Fulltext online at Jstor and Ebsco.</ref> Stowe's solution was similar to [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s: God's will would be followed if each person sincerely examined his principles and acted on them.<ref name="Bellin"/>

Scholars have also seen the novel as expressing the values and ideas of the [[Free Soil|Free Will Movement]].<ref name="Grant">Grant, David. "Uncle Tom's Cabin and the Triumph of Republican Rhetoric." ''New England Quarterly'' 1998 71(3): 429<U+2013>448. Issn: 0028-4866 Fulltext online at Jstor.</ref> In this view, the character of George Harris embodies the principles of free labor, while the complex character of Ophelia represents those Northerners who condoned compromise with slavery. In contrast to Ophelia is Dinah, who operates on passion. During the course of the novel Ophelia is transformed, just as the [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican Party]] (three years later) proclaimed that the North must transform itself and stand up for its antislavery principles.<ref name="Grant"/>

[[Feminist theory]] can also be seen at play in Stowe's book, with the novel as a critique of the [[patriarchal]] nature of slavery.<ref>Riss, Arthur. "Racial Essentialism and Family Values in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''." ''American Quarterly'' 1994 46(4): 513<U+2013>544. Issn: 0003-0678 Fulltext in JSTOR.</ref> For Stowe, blood relations rather than paternalistic relations between masters and slaves formed the basis of families. Moreover, Stowe viewed national solidarity as an extension of a person's family, thus feelings of nationality stemmed from possessing a shared race. Consequently she advocated African colonization for freed slaves and not amalgamation into American society.

The book has also been seen as an attempt to redefine [[masculinity]] as a necessary step toward the abolition of slavery.<ref name="Wolff">Wolff, Cynthia Griffin. "Masculinity in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''," ''American Quarterly'' 1995 47(4): 595<U+2013>618. ISSN: 0003-0678. Fulltext online at JSTOR.</ref> In this view, abolitionists had begun to resist the vision of aggressive and dominant men that the conquest and colonization of the early 19th century had fostered. In order to change the notion of manhood so that men could oppose slavery without jeopardizing their self-image or their standing in society, some abolitionists drew on principles of [[women's suffrage]] and Christianity as well as passivism, and praised men for cooperation, compassion, and civic spirit. Others within the abolitionist movement argued for conventional, aggressive masculine action. All the men in Stowe's novel are representations of either one kind of man or the other.<ref name=autogenerated1>Wolff, Cynthia Griffin.  "Masculinity in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''," ''American Quarterly'' 1995 47(4): 595<U+2013>618. ISSN: 0003-0678. Fulltext online at JSTOR.</ref>

==Creation and popularization of stereotypes==

[[Image:Sam1888Edition.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of Sam from the 1888 "New Edition" of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''. The character of Sam helped create the stereotype of the lazy, carefree "happy darky."]]

Modern scholars and readers have criticized the book for what are seen as condescending racist descriptions of the book's black characters, especially with regard to the characters' appearances, speech, and behavior, as well as the passive nature of Uncle Tom in accepting his fate.<ref name="Smith 1988">Smith; Jessie Carney; ''Images of Blacks in American Culture: A Reference Guide to Information Sources'' Greenwood Press. 1988.</ref> The novel's creation and use of common [[stereotypes]] about African Americans<ref name="Husler"/> is significant because ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' was the best-selling novel in the world during the 19th century.<ref name=bookrags/> As a result, the book (along with illustrations from the book<ref>[http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/uncletom/illustra/ilhp.html Illustrations], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive. Retrieved April 18, 2007.</ref> and associated stage productions) played a major role in permanently ingraining these stereotypes into the American psyche.<ref name="Smith 1988"/>

Among the [[African-American stereotypes|stereotypes of blacks]] in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' are<ref name="Africana"/> the "happy darky" (in the lazy, carefree character of Sam); the light-skinned [[tragic mulatto]] as a sex object (in the characters of Eliza, Cassy, and Emmeline); the affectionate, dark-skinned female [[mammy archetype|mammy]] (through several characters, including Mammy, a cook at the St. Clare plantation); the [[pickaninny]] stereotype of black children (in the character of Topsy); the Uncle Tom, an African American who is too eager to please white people. Stowe intended Tom to be a "noble hero." The stereotype of him as a "subservient fool who bows down to the white man" evidently resulted from staged "[[Tom Shows]]", over which Stowe had no control.<ref name="NobleHero"/>

These negative associations have to a large degree overshadowed the historical impact of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' as a "vital antislavery tool."<ref name="Africana"/> The beginning of this change in the novel's perception had its roots in an essay by [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]] titled "Everybody<U+2019>s Protest Novel." In the essay, Baldwin called ''Uncle Tom<U+2019>s Cabin'' a "very bad novel" which was also racially obtuse and aesthetically crude,<ref name="Rothstein">[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/23/arts/23conn.html "Digging Through the Literary Anthropology of Stowe<U+2019>s Uncle Tom"], by Edward Rothstein, from the ''[[New York Times]]'', October 23, 2006.</ref> though making several basic mistakes in his analysis.<ref>
He suggests that Miss Ophelia represents Stowe's position, despite her assertion that "I've always had a prejudice against negroes", and assumes that Tom is illiterate.
</ref> In the 1960s and '70s, the [[Black Power]] and [[Black Arts Movement]]s attacked the novel, saying that the character of Uncle Tom engaged in "race betrayal", and that Tom made slaves out to be worse than slave owners.<ref name="Rothstein"/> Criticisms of the other stereotypes in the book also increased during this time. In recent years, however, scholars such as [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]] have begun to re-examine ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', stating that the book is a "central document in American race relations and a significant moral and political exploration of the character of those relations."<ref name="Rothstein"/>

==Anti-Tom literature==
[[Image:Auntphillis.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Title page for ''[[Aunt Phillis's Cabin]]'' by Mary Eastman, one of many examples of Anti-Tom literature.]]
In response to ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', writers in the Southern United States produced a number of books to rebut Stowe's novel. This so-called [[Anti-Tom literature]] generally took a pro-slavery viewpoint, arguing that the issues of slavery as depicted in Stowe's book were overblown and incorrect. The novels in this genre tended to feature a benign white patriarchal master and a pure wife, both of whom presided over child-like slaves in a benevolent extended family style plantation. The novels either implied or directly stated that African Americans were a child-like people<ref>''Playing the Race Card: Melodramas of Black and White from Uncle Tom to O. J. Simpson'' by Linda Williams, Princeton Univ. Press, 2001, page 113.</ref> unable to live their lives without being directly overseen by white people.<ref>''Whitewashing Uncle Tom's Cabin: nineteenth-century women novelists respond to Stowe'' by Joy Jordan-Lake, Vanderbilt University Press, 2005.</ref> 

Among the most famous anti-Tom books are ''[[The Sword and the Distaff]]'' by [[William Gilmore Simms]], ''[[Aunt Phillis's Cabin]]'' by [[Mary Henderson Eastman]], and ''[[The Planter's Northern Bride]]'' by [[Caroline Lee Hentz]],<ref>"[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4113/is_200501/ai_n9483519/pg_1 Caroline Lee Hentz's Long Journey]" by Philip D. Beidler. Alabama Heritage Number 75, Winter 2005.</ref> with the last author having been a close personal friend of Stowe's when the two lived in Cincinnati. Simms' book was published a few months after Stowe's novel, and it contains a number of sections and discussions disputing Stowe's book and her view of slavery. Hentz's 1854 novel, widely-read at the time but now largely forgotten, offers a defense of slavery as seen through the eyes of a northern woman<U+2014>the daughter of an abolitionist, no less<U+2014>who marries a southern slave owner.

In the decade between the publication of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and the start of the [[American Civil War]], between twenty and thirty anti-Tom books were published. Among these novels are two books titled ''Uncle Tom's Cabin As It Is'' (one by W.L. Smith and the other by C.H. Wiley) and a book by [[John Pendleton Kennedy]]. More than half of these anti-Tom books were written by white women, with Simms commenting at one point about the "Seemingly poetic justice of having the Northern woman (Stowe) answered by a Southern woman."<ref>''Figures in Black: words, signs, and the "racial" self'' by Henry Louis Gates, Oxford University Press, 1987, page 134.</ref>

Given the lax copyright laws of the time, stage plays based on ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''<U+2014>"Tom shows"<U+2014>began to appear while the story itself was still being serialized. Stowe refused to authorize dramatization of her work because of her [[puritan]]ical distrust of drama (although she did eventually go to see [[George Aiken (playwright)|George Aiken]]'s version and according to Francis Underwood, was "delighted" by Caroline Howard's portrayal of Topsy).<ref name="Lott">Lott, Eric.

All Tom shows appear to have incorporated elements of [[melodrama]] and [[blackface]] [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]].<ref name="Africanapg44">''Africana: arts and letters: an A-to-Z reference of writers, musicians, and artists of the African American Experience'' by Henry Louis Gates, Kwame Anthony Appiah, Running Press, 2005, page 44.</ref> These plays varied tremendously in their politics<U+2014>some faithfully reflected Stowe's sentimentalized antislavery politics, while others were more moderate, or even pro-slavery.<ref name="Lott"/> Many of the productions featured demeaning racial caricatures of Black people,<ref name="Africanapg44"/> while a number of productions also featured songs by [[Stephen Foster]] (including "[[My Old Kentucky Home]]", "[[Old Folks at Home]]", and "Massa's in the Cold Ground").<ref name="By storm"/> The best-known Tom Shows were those of [[George Aiken (playwright)|George Aiken]] and H.J. Conway.<ref name="Lott"/> 

The version by Aiken is perhaps the best known stage adaptation, released just a few months after the novel was published. This six-act behemoth also set an important precedent by being the first show on Broadway to stand on its own, without the performance of other entertainments or any afterpiece.<ref>Wilmeth, Don B., ed. Staging the Nation: Plays from the American Theater, 1787<U+2013>1909. Boston: Bedford Books, 1998, page 181.</ref> Most of Aiken's dialogue is lifted verbatim from Stowe's novel and it included four full musical numbers written by the producer, George C. Howard.<ref>Aiken, George L. Uncle Tom<U+2019>s Cabin. New York: Garland, 1993.</ref> Another legacy of this adaptation is its reliance upon very different locations all portrayed on the same stage. This reliance led to large sets and set a precedent for the future days of film.<ref>Gerould, Daniel C., ed. American Melodrama. New York: Performing Arts Journal Publications, 1983, page 16.</ref> By focusing on the stark and desperate situations of his characters, Aiken appealed to the emotions of his audiences.<ref>Gerould, Daniel C., ed. American Melodrama. New York: Performing Arts Journal Publications, 1983, page 14.</ref> By combining this melodramatic approach with the content of Stowe's novel, Aiken helped to create a powerful visual indictment against the institution of slavery.

The many stage variants of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' "dominated northern popular culture... for several years" during the 19th century,<ref name="Lott"/> and the plays were still being performed in the early 20th century.

One of the unique and controversial variants of the Tom Shows was Walt Disney's 1933 [[Mickey's Mellerdrammer]]. ''Mickey's Mellerdrammer'' is a [[United Artists]] film [[1933 in film|released in 1933]]. The title is a corruption of "melodrama", thought to harken back to the earliest [[minstrel shows]], as a film short based on a production of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' by the [[Disney]] characters. In that film, [[Mickey Mouse]] and friends stage their own production of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''.
Mickey Mouse was already black-colored, but the [http://www.moviegoods.com/movie_poster/mickeys_mellerdrammer_1933.htm advertising poster] for the film shows Mickey dressed in [[blackface]] with exaggerated, orange lips; bushy, white sidewhiskers made out of cotton; and his trademark white gloves.

=== Film adaptations ===
{{Main|Uncle Tom's Cabin (film adaptations)}}

''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' has been made into a number of film versions. Most of these movies were created during the [[silent film]] era (with ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' being the most-filmed story of that time period).<ref name="UTCFilm">[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/fihp.html Uncle Tom's Cabin on Film], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive. Retrieved April 19, 2007.</ref> This was because of the continuing popularity of both the book and Tom shows, meaning audiences were already familiar with the characters and the plot, making it easier for the film to be understood without spoken words.<ref name="UTCFilm"/> There has been no Hollywood treatment since the end of the silent era.

The first film version of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' was one of the earliest full-length movies (although full-length at that time meant between 10 and 14 minutes).<ref name="Porter">[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/mv03hp.html The First Uncle Tom's Cabin Film: Edison-Porter's Slavery Days (1903)], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive. Retrieved April 19, 2007.</ref> This 1903 film, directed by [[Edwin S. Porter]], used white actors in [[blackface]] in the major roles and black performers only as [[Extra (actor)|extras]]. This version was evidently similar to many of the Tom Shows of earlier decades and featured a large number of black stereotypes (such as having the slaves dance in almost any context, including at a slave auction).<ref name="Porter"/>

In 1910, a three-reel [[Vitagraph Studios|Vitagraph Company of America]] production was directed by [[J. Stuart Blackton]] and adapted by Eugene Mullin. According to ''The Dramatic Mirror,'' this film was "a decided innovation" in motion pictures and "the first time an American company" released a dramatic film in 3 reels. Until then, full-length movies of the time were 15 minutes long and contained only one reel of film. The movie starred [[Florence Turner]], [[Mary Fuller]], Edwin R. Phillips, [[Flora Finch]], [[Genevieve Tobin]] and [[Carlyle Blackwell]], Sr.<ref>[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/mv10hp1.html The 3-Reel Vitagraph Production (1910)], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive. Retrieved April 19, 2007.</ref>

At least four more movie adaptations were created in the next two decades. The last silent film version came in 1927. Directed by [[Harry A. Pollard]] (who played Uncle Tom in a 1913 release of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''), this two hour movie spent more than a year in production and was the third most expensive picture of the silent era (at a cost of $1.8 million). Black actor [[Charles Sidney Gilpin|Charles Gilpin]] was originally cast in the title role but was fired after the studio decided his "portrayal was too aggressive."<ref name="SuperJewel">[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/mv27hp.html Universal Super Jewel Production (1927)], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive. Retrieved April 19, 2007.</ref> [[James B. Lowe]] took over the character of Tom. The screenplay takes many liberties with the original book, including altering the Eliza and George subplot, introducing the Civil War and Emancipation, and combining the characters of Eliza and Emmeline.<ref name="SuperJewel"/> Another difference occurs after Tom dies: Simon Legree finds himself haunted by an apparitional vision of Tom and falls to his own death in a futile effort to attack the ghostly image. 

Black media outlets of the time praised the film, but the studio<U+2014>fearful of a backlash from Southern and white film audiences<U+2014>ended up cutting out controversial scenes, including the film's opening sequence at a slave auction (where a mother is torn away from her baby).<ref>''Slow Fade to Black: The Negro in American Film, 1900<U+2013>1942'' by Thomas Cripps, Oxford University Press, 1993, page 48.</ref> The story was adapted by Pollard, Harvey F. ''Thew'' and [[A. P. Younger]], with titles by [[Walter Anthony]]. It starred James B. Lowe, [[Virginia Grey]], [[George Siegmann]], [[Margarita Fischer]], [[Mona Ray]] and [[Madame Sul-Te-Wan]].<ref name="SuperJewel"/>

For several decades after the end of the silent film era, the subject matter of Stowe's novel was judged too sensitive for further film interpretation. In 1946, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] considered filming the story but ceased production after protests led by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]].<ref name="Hollywood">[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/cameos/hollywood.html Uncle Tom's Cabin in Hollywood: 1929<U+2013>1956], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive. Retrieved April 19, 2007.</ref>

[[Image:Babbuncletomscabin.jpg|right|thumb|A movie poster from [[Kroger Babb]]'s 1965 production of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'']]

A German language version, ''Onkel Toms H<U+00FC>tte'', directed by G<U+00E9>za von Radv<U+00E1>nyi, appeared in 1965 and was presented in the United States by [[exploitation film]] presenter [[Kroger Babb]]. 
The most recent film version was a television broadcast in 1987 directed by [[Stan Lathan]] and adapted by John Gay. It starred [[Avery Brooks]], [[Phylicia Rashad]], [[Edward Woodward]], [[Jenny Lewis]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]] and Endyia Kinney.

In addition to film adaptations, versions of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' have featured in other formats. In [[Brazil]], the adapted version ''A Cabana do Pai Tom<U+00E1>s'' was produced as a TV soap opera by [[Rede Globo]] having 205 episodes and was aired from July 1969 to March 1970. A number of [[animated cartoon]]s, including  the [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoon ''[[Southern Fried Rabbit]]'' (1953), where Bugs disguises himself as Uncle Tom and sings ''[[My Old Kentucky Home]]'' in order to cross the [[Mason-Dixon line]]; ''[[Uncle Tom's Bungalow]]'' (1937), a Warner Brothers cartoon supervised by [[Tex Avery]]; ''Eliza on Ice'' (1944), one of the earliest [[Mighty Mouse]] cartoons produced by [[Paul Terry (cartoonist)|Paul Terry]]; and ''Uncle Tom's Caba<U+00F1>a'' (1947), an eight-minute cartoon directed by Tex Avery.<ref name="Hollywood"/>

''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' has influenced a large number of movies, including ''[[Birth of a Nation]]''. This controversial 1915 film deliberately used a cabin similar to Uncle Tom's home in the film's dramatic climax, where several white Southerners unite with their former enemy (Yankee soldiers) to defend what the film's caption says is their "[[Aryan race|Aryan]] birthright." According to scholars, this reuse of such a familiar cabin would have resonated with, and been understood by, audiences of the time.<ref>''Playing the Race Card: Melodramas of Black and White from Uncle Tom to O. J. Simpson'' by Linda Williams, Princeton Univ. Press, 2001, page 115. Also [http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/cameos/griffithhp.html H. B. Stowe's Cabin in D. W. Griffith's Movie], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive. Retrieved April 19, 2007.</ref>

Among the other movies influenced by or making use of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' include ''Dimples'' (a 1936 [[Shirley Temple]] film),<ref name="Hollywood"/> ''Uncle Tom's Uncle,'' (a 1926 [[Our Gang]] episode),<ref name="Hollywood"/> its 1932 remake ''[[Spanky (film)|Spanky]]'', the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musical ''[[The King and I]]'' (in which a ballet called "Small House of Uncle Thomas" is performed in traditional Siamese style), and ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' (in which [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Daniel Day-Lewis]]'s characters attend an imagined wartime adaptation of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'').
