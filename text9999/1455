'''Bob Hope''', [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Order of St. Gregory the Great|KCSG]] (born '''Leslie Townes Hope'''; May 29, 1903&nbsp;<U+2013> July 27, 2003) was an American [[comedian]] and [[actor]] who appeared in [[vaudeville]], on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], and in radio, television and movies. He was also noted for his work with the [[US Armed Forces]] and his numerous [[United Service Organizations|USO]] tours entertaining American military personnel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.war-letters.com/0014/0007.html |title= Testament of his popularity |accessdate= |work= }}</ref> Throughout his career, he was honored for his humanitarian work. In 1996, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] honored Bob Hope by declaring him the "first and only honorary veteran of the U.S. armed forces." Bob Hope appeared in or hosted 199 known USO shows.<ref>AUG 11 2004 USO Publication "Down-Range"</ref>

== Early years ==
Hope was born in [[Eltham]], [[London]], [[England]], the fifth of seven sons. His father, William Henry Hope, was a [[stonemason]] from [[Weston-super-Mare]], [[Somerset]] and his [[Wales|Welsh]] mother, Avis Townes, was a [[operetta|light opera]] singer who later worked as a cleaning woman. The family lived in Weston-super-Mare, then [[St George, Bristol|Whitehall]] and [[St George, Bristol|St George]] in [[Bristol]], before moving to [[Cleveland, Ohio]] in 1908. The family emigrated to the United States aboard the SS ''Philadelphia'', and passed inspection at [[Ellis Island]] on March 30, 1908. Hope became a U.S. citizen in 1920 at the age of seventeen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E7DF1439F933A15756C0A96E958260&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/H/Hope,%20Bob |title= Bob Hope's Gift to the Nation?

From the age of 12, he worked at a variety of odd jobs at a local [[boardwalk]]. He would [[busking|busk]],<ref name="loc.gov">[http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/bobhope/early.html Bob Hope and the American Variety: Early Life]&nbsp;<U+2013> [[Library of Congress]] site on Bob Hope</ref> doing dance and comedy patter to make extra money (oftentimes on the [[Tram|trolley]] to [[Luna Park, Cleveland|Luna Park]]). He entered many dancing and amateur talent contests (as Lester Hope),<ref name="loc.gov" /> and won prizes for his impersonation of [[Charlie Chaplin]]. He also boxed briefly and unsuccessfully under the name Packy East, once making it to the semifinals of the Ohio novice championship.<ref>''Current Biography 1941'', pp402-04</ref>

In 1918 at the age of 15 he was admitted<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistory.org/resource/database/industrial/ |title=OHS&nbsp;<U+2014> Archives/Library&nbsp;<U+2014> Boys and Girls Industrial School Index |publisher=Ohiohistory.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-11}}</ref> (as Lester Hope) to the Boys Industrial School<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2113 |title=Boys' Industrial School&nbsp;<U+2014> Ohio History Central&nbsp;<U+2014> A product of the Ohio Historical Society |publisher=Ohio History Central |date=2005-07-01 |accessdate=2010-04-11}}</ref> in Lancaster, Ohio. Formerly known as the Ohio Reform School, this was one of the more innovative, progressive institutions for juvenile offenders. As an adult, Hope donated sizable sums of money to the institution.

Silent film comedian [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Fatty Arbuckle]] saw one of his performances with his first partner, Lloyd "Lefty" Durbin, and in 1925 got the pair steady work with Hurley's Jolly Follies. Within a year, Hope had formed an act called the Dancemedians with George Byrne and the [[Hilton twins|Hilton Sisters]], conjoined twins who had a tap dancing routine. Hope and his partner George Byrne had an act as a pair of Siamese twins as well, and both danced and sang while wearing [[blackface]], before friends advised Hope that he was funnier as himself.<ref> Id. 402-03</ref> In 1929, he changed his first name to "Bob". In one version of the story, he named himself after racecar driver [[Bob Burman]]. In another, he said he chose Bob because he wanted a name with a friendly "Hiya Fellas!" sound to it. After five years on the vaudeville circuit, by his own account, Hope was surprised and humbled when he and his partner (and future wife) Grace Louise Troxell failed a 1930 screen test for [[Path<U+00E9>]] at [[Culver City, California|Culver City]], California.

== Career ==
=== Film ===
{{Main|Bob Hope filmography}}
Hope, like other stage performers, made his first films in New York. [[Educational Pictures]] employed him in 1934 for a short-subject comedy, ''[[Going Spanish]]''. Hope sealed his fate with Educational when [[Walter Winchell]] asked him about the film. Hope cracked, "When they catch [[John Dillinger]], they're going to make him sit through it twice."<ref>Maltin, Leonard. ''The Great Movie Shorts''. (1972). p. 25.</ref> Educational fired him, but he was soon before the cameras at New York's [[Vitaphone]] studio starring in 20-minute comedies and musicals from 1934 through 1936.

[[Paramount Pictures]] signed Hope for the 1938 film ''[[The Big Broadcast of 1938]]''. During a duet with [[Shirley Ross]] as accompanied by [[Shep Fields]] and his orchestra, Hope introduced the song later to become his trademark, "[[Thanks for the Memory]]", which became a major hit and was praised by critics. The sentimental, fluid nature of the music allowed Hope's writers (whom he is said to have depended upon heavily throughout his career) to later invent endless variations of the song to fit specific circumstances, such as bidding farewell to troops while on tour.

Hope became one of Paramount's biggest stars, and would remain with the studio through the 1950s. Hope's regular appearances in Hollywood films and radio made him one of the best known entertainers in North America, and at the height of his career he was also making a large income from live concert performances.
[[File:BobHope.JPG|right|thumb|The handprints of Bob Hope in front of [[The Great Movie Ride]] at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] theme park]]
As a movie star, he was best known for ''[[My Favorite Brunette]]'' and the highly successful [[Road to...|"Road"]] movies in which he starred with [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Dorothy Lamour]]. Hope had seen Lamour as a nightclub singer in New York, and invited her to work on his [[United Service Organizations|USO]] tours. Lamour is said to have arrived for filming prepared with her lines, only to be baffled by completely re-written scripts from Hope's writers without studio permission. Hope and Lamour were lifelong friends, and she is the actress most associated with his film career. Other female co-stars included [[Paulette Goddard]], [[Lucille Ball]], [[Jane Russell]], and [[Hedy Lamarr]].

Hope was [[Master of Ceremonies|host]] of the Academy Awards ceremony 18 times between 1939 and 1977. His feigned lust for an [[Academy Award]] became part of his act. In one scene from ''[[Road to Morocco]]'' he erupted in a frenzy, shouting about his imminent death from exposure. Bing Crosby reminds him that rescue is just minutes away, and a disappointed Hope complains that Crosby has spoiled his best scene, and thus his chance for an Academy Award. Also, in ''The Road to Bali'', when Crosby finds Humphrey Bogart's Oscar for ''The African Queen'', Hope grabs it, saying "Give me that. You've got one." Although Hope was never nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for his performances ([[Bing Crosby]] won the Best Actor for ''[[Going My Way]]'' in 1944), the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] honored him with four honorary awards, and in 1960, the [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]]. While introducing the 1968 telecast, he quipped, "Welcome to the Academy Awards, or, as it's known at my house, [[Passover]]."<ref>McCaffrey, Donald W. ''The road to comedy: the films of Bob Hope''. (2005). p. 56.</ref>

=== Broadcasting ===
{{Main|Bob Hope television appearances}}

Hope first appeared on television in 1932 during a test transmission from an experimental [[CBS]] studio in New York. In January 1947, Hope was master of ceremonies for the first telecast by California's first television station, [[KTLA]]. His career in broadcasting spanned 64 years and included a long association with [[NBC]]. Hope made his network radio debut in 1937 on NBC. His first regular series for NBC Radio was the ''Woodbury Soap Hour''. A year later, ''The [[Pepsodent]] Show Starring Bob Hope'' began, continuing as ''The New Swan Show'' in 1948 (for the same sponsor, [[Lever Brothers]]). After 1950, the series was known simply as ''The Bob Hope Show'', with [[Liggett & Myers]] (1950<U+2013>52), [[General Foods]] (1953) and [[American Dairy Association]] (1953<U+2013>55) as his sponsors, until it finally went off the air in April 1955. Regulars on his radio series included zany [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]] and [[Barbara Jo Allen]] as spinster Vera Vague.
[[File:Colonnahope.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]] and Bob Hope as caricatured by [[Sam Berman]] for NBC's 1947 promotional book.]]

Hope did many specials for the NBC television network in the following decades, beginning in April 1950. These were often sponsored by [[General Motors]] (1955<U+2013>61), [[Chrysler]] (1963<U+2013>73) and [[Texaco]] (1975<U+2013>85), and Hope served as a spokesman for both companies for many years. and would sometimes introduce himself as "Bob, from Texaco, Hope." Hope's Christmas specials were popular favorites and often featured a performance of "[[Silver Bells]]" (from his 1951 film ''[[The Lemon Drop Kid]]'') done as a duet with an often much younger female guest star (such as [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Barbara Eden]], and [[Brooke Shields]]).

In October 1956, Hope appeared on an episode of the most-viewed program in America at the time, ''[[I Love Lucy]]''. He said, upon receiving the script: "What? A script? I don't need one of these"{{Cite quote|date=September 2009}}, and ad-libbed the entire episode. [[Desi Arnaz]] said of Hope after his appearance: "Bob is a very nice man, he can crack you up, no matter how much you try for him to not."{{Cite quote|date=September 2009}} Lucy and Desi returned the favor by appearing on one of his ''Chevy Show'' specials (with [[Vivian Vance]] and [[William Frawley]]) later that season.

Hope's 1970 and 1971 Christmas specials for NBC<U+2014>filmed in [[Vietnam]] in front of military audiences at the height of the war<U+2014>are on the list of the [[List of most-watched television episodes#Top 30 Network Primetime Telecasts of All Time|Top 30 U.S. Network Primetime Telecasts of All Time]]. Both were seen by more than 60% of the U.S. households watching television.

In 1992, Bob Hope made a guest appearance as himself on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', in the episode "[[Lisa the Beauty Queen]]" (season 4, episode 4). The episode attracted 11.1 million viewers when it premiered on October 15. His final television special, ''Laughing with the Presidents'', was broadcast in 1996, with [[Tony Danza]] helping Hope present a personal retrospective of [[president of the United States|presidents of the United States]] known to the comedian.

[[File:Bob hope lackland afb.jpg|thumb|upright|Bob Hope and golf club, Lackland Air Force Base, 1990]]
Hope performed his first [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) show on May 6, 1941, at [[March Air Reserve Base|March Field]], California. He continued to travel and entertain troops for the rest of World War II<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.war-letters.com/0014/0006.html |title= WW2 4th of July concert |accessdate= |work= }}</ref> and later during the [[Korean War]], the [[Vietnam War]] and the 1990<U+2013>1991 [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]]. When overseas he almost always performed in Army [[fatigues (uniform)|fatigues]] as a show of support for his audience. Hope's USO career lasted half a century, during which he headlined approximately 60 tours. For his service to his country through the USO, he was awarded the [[Sylvanus Thayer Award]] by the [[USMA|United States Military Academy]] at West Point in 1968.

Of Hope's USO shows in World War II, writer [[John Steinbeck]], who was then working as a war correspondent, wrote in 1943:

{{cquote|When the time for recognition of service to the nation in wartime comes to be considered, Bob Hope should be high on the list. This man drives himself and is driven. It is impossible to see how he can do so much, can cover so much ground, can work so hard, and can be so effective. He works month after month at a pace that would kill most people.<ref>John Steinbeck (1958) ''[[Once There Was A War]]'', New York: Bantam, p.65.</ref>}}

A 1997 act of [[United States Congress|Congress]] signed by [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] named Hope an "Honorary Veteran." He remarked, "I've been given many awards in my lifetime&nbsp;<U+2014> but to be numbered among the men and women I admire most&nbsp;<U+2014> is the greatest honor I have ever received."<ref>Faith, William Robert. ''Bob Hope: A Life in Comedy''. (2003). De Capo Press. p. 429.</ref>

Hope appeared in so many theaters of war over the decades that it was often cracked (in Bob Hope style) that "Where there's death, there's Hope".

In 2009, [[Stephen Colbert]] carried a golf club on stage each night during his own week-long USO performance and taping of ''[[The Colbert Report]]''<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/13/opinion/ed-colbert13 "A salute for Stephen Colbert"]. ''Los Angeles Times''.</ref> and explained in his last episode that it was an homage to Hope.

=== Theater ===
Hope's first Broadway appearances, in 1927's ''The Sidewalks of New York'' and 1928's ''Ups-a-Daisy'', were nothing but mere walk-ons.<ref> Id., p403</ref>

He returned to Broadway in 1933 to star as Huckleberry Haines in the [[Jerome Kern]]/[[Dorothy Fields]] musical ''[[Roberta]]''. Stints in the musicals ''[[Say When]]'', the 1936 [[Ziegfeld Follies]] (with [[Fanny Brice]]), and ''[[Red, Hot and Blue]]'' with [[Ethel Merman]] and [[Jimmy Durante]] followed. His performances were generally well-received and critics noted his keen sense of comedic timing.

Hope reprised his role as Huck Haines in a 1958 production of ''Roberta'' at [[The Muny]] Theater in [[Forest Park]], [[St. Louis, Missouri]].

Hope rescued Eltham Little Theatre from closure by providing the funds to buy the property, he continued his interest and support and regularly visited when in London. The Theatre was renamed in his honour in 1982 and it would not be here today were it not for him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bobhopetheatre.co.uk/hundredth.htm |title=Bob Hope's 100th Birthday |publisher=Bobhopetheatre.co.uk |date=2003-05-29 |accessdate=2010-04-11}}</ref>

=== Sports ===
Hope was an avid golfer. He was introduced to the game in the 1930s, and eventually played to a four [[Golf handicap|handicap]]. His love for the game, and the humor he could find in it, made him a much sought-after [[foursome (golf)|foursome]] member. He once remarked that President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] gave up golf for painting&nbsp;<U+2013> "fewer strokes, you know."<ref>{{cite web|author=Resources |url=http://www.panews.com/sportsbobwest/local_story_185203216.html |title=Bob West Sports Rap, Port Arthur (TX) News, 05-31-1980, retrieved on 07-19-2008 |publisher=Panews.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-29}}</ref> In 1978, he putted against a then two-year-old [[Tiger Woods]] in a television appearance on [[The Mike Douglas Show]]. By the 1980s, a golf club became an integral [[Theatrical property|prop]] for Hope during the [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]] segments of his television specials and USO Shows.

The [[Bob Hope Classic]] was founded in 1960, and is currently the only [[FedEx Cup]] tournament that takes place over five rounds. The tournament made history in 1995, when Hope teed up for the opening round in a foursome that included Presidents [[Gerald R. Ford]], [[George H.W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]]&nbsp;<U+2013> the only time ever that three presidents participated in a golf foursome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhcc.com/history.html |title=Bob Hope Chrysler Classic history, retrieved 7/19/2008 |publisher=Bhcc.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-29}}</ref>

Hope would frequently use his television specials to promote the annual [[College Football All-America Team]]. The team members would enter the stage one by one and introduce themselves, and Hope would then give a one-liner about the player or his school. Hope would often don a football uniform for these presentations.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages ===
<!--According to biographer Arthur Marx, -->Hope's first wife was his vaudeville partner Grace Louise Troxell, whom he married on January 25, 1933. When the marriage record was unearthed some years later, Hope denied that the marriage had any substance and said they had quickly divorced. There were rumors that he fathered a daughter with Troxell and that he continued to send generous cheques to her despite a widely documented reputation for [[frugality]]. In 1934 Bob Hope married [[Dolores Hope|Dolores Reade]], and adopted four children at The Cradle in [[Evanston, Illinois]]: Linda, Anthony, Laura and Kelley.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/28/obit.hope/index.html |title=Bob Hope dead at 100 |publisher=CNN |date=2003-07-29 |accessdate=2008-11-02}}</ref> From them he had four grandchildren.

As Hope entered his ninth decade, he showed no signs of slowing down and continued appearing in numerous television specials. He was given an 80th birthday party in 1983 at the [[Kennedy Center]] in Washington, D.C. which was attended by President Ronald Reagan. In 1985, he was presented with the Life Achievement Award at the [[Kennedy Center Honors]]. He was presented with the [[Ronald Reagan Freedom Award]] in 1997 by [[Nancy Reagan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reaganfoundation.org/programs/cpa/awards.asp |title=Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Library |publisher=Reaganfoundation.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-02}}</ref> The following year, Hope was appointed an honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent [[Order of the British Empire]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Upon accepting the appointment, Hope quipped, "I'm speechless. 70 years of ad lib material and I'm speechless".<ref>[http://www.bobhope.com/bob6.htm "Bob's Biography (Television)."] ''BobHope.com''.</ref> [[File:Nancy Reagan presents Ronald Reagan Freedom Award to Bob Hope.jpg|thumb|left|Nancy Reagan presents Hope with the [[Ronald Reagan Freedom Award]], 1997]]At the age of 95, Hope made an appearance at the 50th anniversary of the [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] with [[Milton Berle]] and [[Sid Caesar]]. Two years later, Hope was present at the opening of the Bob Hope Gallery of American Entertainment at the [[Library of Congress]].

Hope celebrated his 100th birthday on May 29, 2003, joining a small group of notable centenarians in the field of entertainment (including [[Irving Berlin]], [[Hal Roach]], [[Senor Wences]], [[George Abbott]], [[Adolph Zukor]], [[Barbara Kent]] and [[George Burns]].) To mark this event, the intersection of [[Hollywood and Vine]] in Los Angeles, California was named ''Bob Hope Square'' and his centennial was declared ''Bob Hope Day'' in 35 states. Hope spent the day privately in his [[Toluca Lake, Los Angeles, California|Toluca Lake, Los Angeles]] home where he had lived since 1937. Even at 100, Hope was said to have maintained his self-deprecating sense of humor, quipping, "I'm so old, they've canceled my [[blood type]]."<ref name="bbcdeath" />

=== Death ===
[[File:BobHopeUSO.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hope performing at a USO show]]
Hope had [[List of premature obituaries|premature obituaries]] on two separate occasions. In 1998 a prepared obituary by [[The Associated Press]] was inadvertently released on the Internet, prompting Hope's death to be announced in the [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]].<ref>Quirk, Lawrence J. ''Bob Hope&nbsp;<U+2013> The Road Well-Traveled''. (1998) p. 313.</ref> In 2003 he was among several famous figures whose pre-written obituaries were published on [[CNN]]'s website due to a lapse in password protection.

Beginning in 2000, Hope's health steadily declined and he was hospitalized several times before his death. In June 2000 he spent nearly a week in a California hospital after being hospitalized for [[gastrointestinal bleeding]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/Movies/06/07/bob.hope.03/ |title=Bob Hope released from hospital |publisher=CNN |date=2000-06-07 |accessdate=2008-11-02}}</ref> In August 2001, he spent close to two weeks in the hospital recovering from [[pneumonia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2001/sep/04/news1 |title=Bob Hope stays in hospital |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=2001-09-04 |accessdate=2008-11-02}}</ref>

On July 27, 2003, Bob Hope died at his home in Toluca Lake at 9:28 p.m. According to one of Hope's daughters, when asked on his deathbed where he wanted to be buried, he told his wife, "Surprise me."<ref name="bbcdeath">{{cite news|author= Staff writer|title= Comedian Bob Hope dies|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/3103751.stm|work= [[BBC News Online]]|date= 2003-07-28|accessdate= 2008-05-29}}</ref> After his death, [[Cardinal Roger Mahony]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles|Archbishop of Los Angeles]], confirmed that Hope had converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] years before he died and added that he had died a Catholic in good standing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/Churches/StCharles.shtml |title=St. Charles Catholic Church |publisher=Seeing-stars.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-02}}</ref> He was interred in the Bob Hope Memorial Garden at [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]] in Los Angeles, where his mother is also buried.
