The '''Gastambide-Mengin monoplane''' (later '''Gastambide-Mengin I''', '''Gastambide-Mengin II''' and '''Antoinette II''') was an early [[France|French]] [[experimental aircraft]] designed by [[Leon Levavasseur]] and was the first aircraft built by the [[Antoinette (manufacturer)|Antoinette]] company.<ref name="orbis" /> The name came from [[Jules Gastambide]] who financed the company and [[Gabriel Mengin]] the aircraft engineer.<ref name = "GM"/>

==Design and development==
The monoplane (later known as the '''Gastambide-Mengin I''') was powered by a {{convert|50|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Antoinette (manufacturer)|Antoinette]] piston engine driving a tractor propeller.<ref name="orbis" /> It was noted for having a complex quadricycle landing gear.<ref name="orbis" /> The monoplane made four flights between 8 and 14 February 1908 flown by a mechanic named Boyer, the furthest being a flight of 150m.<ref name="orbis" /> After these flights the aircraft was rebuilt between February and August 1908 as the '''Gastambide-Mengin II''' (later named the '''Antoinette II'''), the modifications included revised triangular ailerons.<ref name="orbis" /> The modified aircraft made three short flights in August 1908, one of these on 21 August 1908 was the first circle flown by a monoplane and on a flight the previous day (20 August 1908) Robert Gastambride became the first passenger flown in a monoplane.<ref name="orbis" /> With lessons learnt from the design Levavassuer went on to design a family of monoplanes names after Antoinette Gastambide the daughter of Jules Gastambide.<ref name="orbis" />
