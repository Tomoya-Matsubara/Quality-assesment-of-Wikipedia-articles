'''Frank William Crilley''' (September 13, 1883 <U+2013> November 23, 1947) was a [[United States Navy]] [[United States Navy Diver|diver]] and a recipient of the United States military's highest decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]].

==Biography==
Crilley was born in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], on September 13, 1883. After enlisting in the U.S. Navy in March 1900, he became a [[gunner's mate]] and received additional training as a diver.<ref name="nhcbio"/>

On April 17, 1915, Crilley, by then a [[Chief Petty Officer|chief]] gunner's mate, participated in a dive to inspect the wreck of the submarine {{USS|F-4|SS-23}} in preparation for a [[Marine salvage|salvage operation]]. The ''F-4'' had sunk weeks earlier in {{convert|300|ft|m}} of water off the coast of [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. Another diver, Chief Gunner's Mate William F. Loughman, became trapped underwater while returning to the surface after examining one of the ''F-4's'' [[hawser]]s. Loughman's lifeline and air hose became tangled in the hawser, preventing him from either ascending or descending. Crilley voluntarily dove down and untangled the lines, allowing Loughman to be pulled to safety. For these actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor thirteen years later, on November 19, 1928.<ref name="citation"/><ref name=searle/>

In 1917, Crilley was appointed to the [[warrant officer]] rank of Gunner(T), and in February 1918 became an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]]. He commanded {{USS|Salvor|SP-3418}} in 1919 and left active duty in July of that year. In the mid-1920s, he was involved with salvaging {{USS|S-51|SS-162}}, and returned to active naval service in 1927-28 to work on the recovery of {{USS|S-4|SS-109}}. He was awarded the Navy's second-highest decoration, the [[Navy Cross]], for his actions as a diver during that operation.<ref name="nhcbio"/>

In 1931, Crilley served as [[Second Officer (nautical)|second officer]] and master diver during the [[Arctic]] expedition of the civilian submarine ''Nautilus'' (previously known as {{USS|O-12|SS-73|6}}). Also in 1931, he assisted with the salvage of {{USS|Mayflower|PY-1}}. Transferred to the retired list in May 1932, he was again employed on Navy work in 1939, during the salvage of {{USS|Squalus|SS-192}}.<ref name="nhcbio"/>

Crilley died at the Naval Hospital in [[Brooklyn, New York]], on November 23, 1947.<ref name="nhcbio"/>

==Namesake==
The salvage ship {{USS|Crilley|YHLC-1}} was named in his honor.<ref name="nhcbio"/>

==Medal of Honor citation==
Crilley's official Medal of Honor citation reads:
<blockquote>For display of extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession above and beyond the call of duty during the diving operations in connection with the sinking in a depth of water 304 feet, of the U.S.S. ''F-4'' with all on board, as a result of loss of depth control, which occurred off Honolulu, [[Territory of Hawaii|T.H.]], on 25 March 1915. On 17 April 1915, William F. Loughman, chief gunner's mate, U.S. Navy, who had descended to the wreck and had examined one of the wire hawsers attached to it, upon starting his ascent, and when at a depth of 250 feet beneath the surface of the water, had his lifeline and air hose so badly fouled by this hawser that he was unable to free himself; he could neither ascend nor descend. On account of the length of time that Loughman had already been subjected to the great pressure due to the depth of water, and of the uncertainty of the additional time he would have to be subjected to this pressure before he could be brought to the surface, it was imperative that steps be taken at once to clear him. Instantly, realizing the desperate case of his comrade, Crilley volunteered to go to his aid, immediately donned a diving suit and descended. After a lapse of time of 2 hours and 11 minutes, Crilley was brought to the surface, having by a superb exhibition of skill, coolness, endurance and fortitude, untangled the snarl of lines and cleared his imperiled comrade, so that he was brought, still alive, to the surface.<ref name="citation"/></blockquote>
