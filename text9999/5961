"'''The Convict'''" is the ninth episode of the [[The Office (U.S. season 3)|third season]] of the American [[comedy]] television series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', and the show's 37th overall. It first aired on November 30, 2006 in the United States on the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC). The episode was the series' first original script written by [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]], who are the creators of the [[The Office (UK TV series)|original British comedy series of the same name]]. It was directed by [[Jeffrey Blitz]], his first such credit of the series.

The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] and [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] branches of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In this episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) discovers that an employee named [[Characters from The Office (US)#Martin Nash|Martin Nash]] ([[Wayne Wilderson]]), who came with the branches' recent merger, was previously in prison. Michael becomes frustrated when Martin's stories of prison sound better than working in the office. Meanwhile, [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) plays a prank on [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) by giving incorrect information to [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) on how to impress her.

According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], an estimated 9.07 million viewers watched "The Convict" on its first broadcast, making it up to that point the largest audience of the season. Among adults aged 18 to 49, it earned a 4.4/11 ratings share, finishing in eighteenth place for the week among all the major networks. Television critics were largely positive towards the episode, particularly Carell's "Prison Mike" sequence as well as [[Ed Helms]]' performance as [[Andy Bernard]].

==Synopsis==
<!-- Per Wikipedia "television episode" guidelines [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:EPISODE#Plot_summaries], the summary should not exceed ten words per minute of screen time. This is a 20-minute episode, so the limit is 200 words. -->
[[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) learns that black employee [[Characters from The Office (US)#Martin Nash|Martin Nash]] ([[Wayne Wilderson]]) is a former criminal, and tells the entire office. During this time, in a misguided effort to avoid issues of [[stereotyping]] and [[racism]] Michael asks the employees to name a white person that they trust and he will name a black person he trusts even more. The name [[Jesus]] pops up and Michael replies with [[Apollo Creed]]. Meanwhile, [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) encourages [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) to pursue [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]), and intentionally gives him wildly incorrect information about her favorite things. Later, Andy strums "[[The Rainbow Connection]]" on his banjo while singing [[falsetto]]. Pam smiles politely and silently shares the joke with Jim.

Martin tells the others he was incarcerated for [[insider trading]], and that he enjoyed certain perks of prison, including outside time and art classes. Pam comments that prison sounds better than their current work situation. Attempting to convince his employees that the office is better than prison, Michael sends everyone to "outside time" in the bitter cold. He then calls a meeting in which he adopts the persona of "Prison Mike." Martin comments that Michael's performance did not remind him of his time in prison. This further infuriates Michael, who then locks all of the staff inside the conference room. [[Toby Flenderson]] ([[Paul Lieberstein]]) tells Michael the staff is simply teasing him. A relieved Michael relents, but Martin chooses to quit.

Gervais first worried that he was too unfamiliar with office protocol in the United States, noting that he "knew everything about this place (in England), the pitfalls, the dos and don'ts. Whereas in America, I don't know if I'm getting it right or not."<ref name=latimesAmericanbranch/> Despite this, his script writing went "remarkably fast. I suppose that's because we'd been away from those characters for two or three years.

That is just my interpretation, but he seems so humble, and kind of reverent."<ref name=kateflannery/> One scene was meant to take place outdoors under cold temperatures, so the parking lot set was laden with fake snow and slush. Also present on set were two sets of twin babies, as the character of Hannah Smotridge-Barr brings her son to the office.<ref name=kateflannery/>

The third season DVD contains several scenes that were deleted from the final cut of the episode. These include Dwight and Andy verbally sparring in the kitchen, Dwight informing Michael that he believes Martin has murdered Meredith, Michael explaining that he created "Prison Mike" in an improvisation class, and Pam giving Andy wildly incorrect tips for hanging out with Jim.<ref>{{cite video |people= |date=2007 |title=Deleted scenes of "The Convict" | medium=DVD |publisher=[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] |location=''The Office: Season Three'' Disc 2 }}</ref>

Eric Goldman of [[IGN]] rated "The Convict" 9 out of 10, an indication of an "amazing" episode. He wrote that "while this wouldn't qualify as one of the very best episodes of the series, the great news is, Gervais and Merchant did an excellent job, working very well within the same-but-different world the US version of the show has created, and delivering some of the biggest and best laughs of the season."<ref name=ignreview>{{Cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/748/748690p1.html |title=The Office: 'The Convict' Review |publisher=[[IGN]] |first=Eric |last=Goldman |date=December 1, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}</ref> Mark A. Perigard of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' however was more critical of the episode, explaining that "Carell is a fearless actor, but he can't stop a train wreck. The B-story is better, as Jim decides to prank Pam by coaching Andy on just the wrong way to woo the receptionist. ''The Office'' has been erratic all season, but even at its worst, it's still the best comedy on television."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-155252818.html|title=TGI Thursday; 'Office' supplies laughs, 'Scrubs' cleans up |work=[[Boston Herald]] |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |first=Mark A.|last= Perigard |date=November 30, 2006 |accessdate=August 25, 2012}} {{Subscription needed}}</ref>

Writing for [[AOL TV]], Michael Sciannamea thought "The Convict" seemed different from previous episodes, citing as evidence the scene of Michael and Martin discussing trustworthy black men; Sciannamea attributed this to its guest writers: "I don't think Gervais and Merchant went over the top...it just seemed a little different than the others."<ref name=aoltvreview/> Also in his review, Sciannamea expressed his gradual enjoyment of Andy, "When I first saw him up in Stamford, I thought he was just the Connecticut version of Dwight. But now I think he adds greatly to the mix and is definitely one who is going to stir things up in Scranton."<ref name=aoltvreview>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2006/11/30/the-office-the-convict/ |title=The Office: The Convict |publisher=[[AOL TV]] |first=Michael |last=Sciannamea |date=November 30, 2006 |accessdate=August 25, 2012}}</ref> Give Me My Remote's Kath Skerry believed "the uncomfortable, unbearably awkward moments that the UK version perfected are definitely present throughout the episode."<ref name=givememyremoteNov29/> She also praised Helms for "prov[ing] once again how perfectly he fits in on this show as he is absolutely hysterical."<ref name=givememyremoteNov29/> 

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' columnist Abby West was pleased with the Jim-Karen storyline and called it "a nice, normal progression for two single people who are into each other."<ref name=ewreview/> She also praised Jim's prank on Pam, especially viewing Helms' performance "amazingly funny as this oblivious blowhard."<ref name=ewreview/> Referring to "Michael's earnest determination not to assume that Martin was the ex-con whom the Stamford office had hired," West found the episode to be a satire of "[[white guilt|white liberal guilt]]".<ref name=ewreview>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1564696,00.html |title=Captive Audience |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=Abby |last=West |date=December 1, 2006 |accessdate=August 25, 2012}} </ref> Reviewers were also positive towards the "Prison Mike" sequence,<ref name=ignreview/><ref name=aoltvreview/> with West calling it "a dead-on impersonation of a badass convict."<ref name=ewreview/> [[Television Without Pity]] gave the episode an "A-".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/the-office/the-convict.php?page=6 |title=The Convict |publisher=[[Television Without Pity]] |first=M |last=Giant |date= |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}</ref>
