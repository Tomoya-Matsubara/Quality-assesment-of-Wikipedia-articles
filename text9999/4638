The '''Independence Monument''' in [[Phnom Penh]], capital of [[Cambodia]], was built in 1958 following the country's independence from [[France]]. It stands on the intersection of Norodom and Sihanouk Boulevards in the centre of the city. It is in the form of a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]]-shaped [[stupa]], of the style seen at the great Khmer temple at [[Angkor Wat]] and other Khmer historical sites. The monument was built by the highly influential Cambodian modern architect [[Vann Molyvann]].

During national celebrations -- most notably, Independence Day -- the monument is the center of activity. A ceremonial flame on the interior pedestal is often lit by a royal or high official on these occasions, and floral tributes line the stairs. Most of the year, however, the monument is visited by photo-taking tourists and locals looking for some quiet conversation.
