{{nihongo|'''''Eyeshield 21'''''|<U+30A2><U+30A4><U+30B7><U+30FC><U+30EB><U+30C9>21|Aish<U+012B>rudo Nij<U+016B>ichi|lead=yes}} is a Japanese manga series written by [[Riichiro Inagaki]] and illustrated by [[Yusuke Murata]]. The series tells the story of [[Sena Kobayakawa]], a introverted boy who joins an [[American football]] club as secretary, but after being coerced by Hiruma, turns out to play wearing an [[eyeshield]] and the number 21, under the pseudonym of "Eyeshield 21". Inagaki chose American football as a central subject of Eyeshield 21 after realizing that it fit perfectly with his idea for the series.

The manga was originally serialized in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Weekly Sh<U+014D>nen Jump]]'' from July 2002 to June 2009. The series consists of 333 chapters collected in 37 ''[[tank<U+014D>bon]]'' volumes. In North America, the manga was released by [[Viz Media]] from April 2005 to October 2011. An [[anime]] adaptation consisting of 145 television episodes was directed by Masayoshi Nishida, and co-produced by [[TV Tokyo]], [[Nihon Ad Systems|NAS]], and [[Gallop (studio)|Gallop]]. The television series first aired on Japan's TV Tokyo network from April 6, 2005 to March 19, 2008. It was later licensed in North America by [[Toonami Jetstream]] as a joint effort with NFL Rush and aired on December 17, 2007, but no more episodes were dubbed because the Toonami Jetstream video-streaming service shut down. The anime series was streamed in English by [[Crunchyroll]]. The ''Eyeshield 21'' franchise has spawned two [[original video animation]]s (OVAs), audio albums, [[video game]]s, and other merchandise.

In Japan, the ''Eyeshield 21'' manga has sold over 20 million volumes as of June 2009. The manga and anime have been featured at various times in the Top Ten lists of their respective media. The anime has been watched by a large number of television viewers in Japan. Publications for manga, anime and others have commented on ''Eyeshield 21'' manga, which received positive comments for its artwork and characters, and negative responses to its non-football scenes.

==Plot==
{{see also|List of Eyeshield 21 characters}}

The plot of ''Eyeshield 21'' revolves around a weak, unassertive boy named [[Sena Kobayakawa]] who enters the high school of his choice{{mdash}}Deimon Private Senior High School. Sena's only remarkable physical abilities are his running speed and agility, which are noted by the school's American football team captain [[Yoichi Hiruma]]. Hiruma forces Sena to join the [[Deimon Devil Bats]] as its [[running back]]. To protect his identity from other teams who want to recruit him, Sena is forced to publicly assume the role of team secretary and enter the field under the pseudonym of "Eyeshield 21", wearing a helmet with an [[eyeshield]] to hide his features. The makeshift team initially takes part in the spring football tournament hoping to win through the strength of their new "secret weapon". However, the extremely weak team is eliminated early by the Ojo White Knights, one of best football teams in Japan.

After Deimon's defeat, the spring tournament is revealed as secondary in importance to the fall tournament, where the teams compete for the chance to play in the [[Christmas Bowl]]{{mdash}}the high school football league championship. Hiruma, [[Ryokan Kurita]], and Sena regroup and slowly build a real team from misfits and students looking to define themselves, such as [[Monta (Eyeshield 21)|Tar<U+014D> "Monta" Raimon]]{{mdash}}a baseball player who can only catch{{mdash}}and the [[The Ha-Ha Brothers|Ha-Ha Brothers]]. Other characters slowly join the team, and the series follows the building and growth of the Deimon Devil Bats and its members, and rival teams as they all strive to achieve their goal of playing in the Christmas Bowl.

Following the Christmas Bowl, Japan begins to gather the best football players to form a team to represent it at the American Football Youth World Championship, where a [[MVP|Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) will be rewarded an [[NFL]] contract and $3 million. Team Japan reaches the final against Team America, in which the game ends as a tie, and both teams are declared winners. Both teams are unsatisfied with this and return to the field for their own, improvised "overtime", causing chaos with officials. It is unclear which team wins the unofficial extra period, but Panther of Team America holds the MVP trophy aloft, winning the professional contract with the San Antonio Armadillos. The series concludes with Sena becoming the captain of the Devil Bats after Hiruma and Kurita leave school to attend college. In his final year of high school, [[List of Eyeshield 21 characters#Team USA|Clifford]] invites Sena to Notre Dame High School. In the final chapter, the main characters are in college or playing amateur-league football while employed.

Before being asked to work on ''Eyeshield 21'', Yusuke Murata had read some of Inagaki's manga and noted that they "had many cool design concepts of uniforms and equipment".

The anime adaptation of ''Eyeshield 21'' received positive and mixed responses.  In her review of the first DVD of the series, Erin Finnegan from Anime News Network stated, "[t]he pace of ''Eyeshield 21'' is its saving grace. It's way less boring than all the time outs and commercial breaks in a regular NFL game. Football is hard to understand, but ''Eyeshield 21'' explains the Byzantine rules&nbsp;...&nbsp;in an entertaining way.
