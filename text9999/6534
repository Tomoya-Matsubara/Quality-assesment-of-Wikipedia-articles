==History and location==
The restaurant is located in New York City's Central Park at [[Central Park West]] and West 67th Street on [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper West Side]]. It was originally the sheepfold that housed the sheep that grazed [[Sheep Meadow, Central Park|Sheep Meadow]], built to a design by [[Calvert Vaux]] in 1870. It became a restaurant as part of a 1934 renovation of the park under [[Robert Moses]], New York City's Commissioner of Parks.  

Since 1934, the landmark Tavern on the Green restaurant in New York's Central Park has been managed by restaurateurs licensed by the City of New York's Park Department. In 1943 Arnold Schleifer and his nephews, Arthur Schleifer and Julius Berman won the contract to operate the restaurant. During their tenure, the dance floor was enlarged and nightly music was enjoyed. A large outdoor patio offered dining al fresco. Trees were first wrapped in the well-known twinkling lights around the property, and the Elm Tree Room was built to surround one of the city<U+2019>s classic elms. The menu was designed to be elegant but affordable for New Yorkers. Luncheon and dinner offerings changed regularly, and Mr. Berman would often add special desserts to celebrate family events, e.g., "Parfait Ruth" to honor the birth of his granddaughter.

The Berman-Schleifer Family ran numerous restaurants they owned and other New York City concessions. Among these were the food venues at [[Orchard Beach, New York|Orchard Beach]], the Claremont Inn (1934-1948) on [[West Side Highway|West Side Drive]], United Nations Caterers, Manny Wolfe<U+2019>s 49th Street Chop House on [[Third Avenue (Manhattan-Bronx)|Third Avenue]], and New York City's first air conditioned restaurant, Schleifer<U+2019>s Fashion Center on [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|7th Avenue]].

In 1962 The Schleifer-Berman interest in the Tavern<U+2019>s operation was sold to Restaurant Associates. <ref>New York Times April 5, 1962</ref>

In 1974, [[Warner LeRoy]] took over the restaurant's lease and reopened it in 1976 after $10 million in renovations. Since LeRoy's death in 2001, it has been managed by his daughter, Jennifer Oz LeRoy.<ref>{{cite news | author =Yaniv, Oren  | title =Tavern on the Green in the red | publisher =New York Daily News | date =February 3, 2009 | url =http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2009/02/02/2009-02-02_tavern_on_the_green_in_the_red.html | accessdate=2009-02-06}}</ref>

In May 2008, the restaurant and the [[Westfield Group]] announced plans to open a second, {{convert|40000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} location in the [[Metreon]] mall in downtown [[San Francisco, California]], in summer 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tavern on the Green coming to the Metreon|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/05/07/BU8F10HO0F.DTL|author=James Temple|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|May 6, 2008|accessdate=2008-05-06|http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/05/06/BU8F10HO0F.DTL}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|publisher=New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/07/dining/07off.html?pagewanted=print|date=2008-05-07|title=Off the Menu|author=Florence Fabricant}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://sanfrancisco.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2008/05/05/daily20.html|title=San Francisco Business Times|date=2008-05-05|author=J.K.

In June, 2008, Tavern on the Green agreed to pay $2.2 million to settle a sexual and racial discrimination lawsuit over claims by the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] of "pervasive harassment" of women and minority employees.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080602/us_nm/tavern_harassment_dc|publisher=reuters|title= Famed NY tavern to pay $2.2 million for discrimination|date=2008-06-02|author=Daniel Trotta}}</ref>

On August 28, 2009, the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]] announced that it had declined to renew the restaurant's license, granting it instead to Dean Poll, operator of the Central Park Boathouse.  The LeRoy management was required to cease operations and remove all furnishings from the location before January 1, 2010.<ref>{{Citation| last = Collins| first = Glenn| title = Why Did Tavern Fail? | newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| pages = D1| year = 2009| date = September 16, 2009| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/16/dining/16tavern.html?_r=1&src=tp| accessdate = 2009-09-17}}</ref>

In September 2009, the restaurant filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, located in New York City, citing the 2009 national financial crisis and the August 28, 2009 loss of the restaurant's operating license.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tavern on the Green Requesting Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/nyregion/10tavern.html |publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]'' |first=Glenn |last=Collins |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-10}}</ref> The rights to the name of the restaurant became an additional source of contention between the LeRoys and the city of New York during the [[bankruptcy court]] procedures in October 2009 after the LeRoys claimed the [[trademark]] was theirs while the city challenged them.<ref name=trade> {{ cite news |author=Collins, Glenn |title=City Wants Tavern<U+2019>s Trademark Name |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/10/nyregion/10tavern.html?_r=2&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss |work=NYTimes.com |date=October 9, 2009 }} </ref> At the time the trademark was appraised at $19 million.<ref name=trade/> In November 2009, Poll registered a backup name with New York State: Tavern in the Park.<ref>Fickenscher, Lisa.
