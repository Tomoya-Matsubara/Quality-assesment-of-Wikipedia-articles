The '''Holden VE Commodore''' is the fourteenth and current model of the [[Holden Commodore]], a [[full-size car]] produced by [[Holden]], the [[Australia]]n subsidiary of [[General Motors]].

The car was officially presented at a media launch in [[Melbourne]] on [[July 16]] [[2006]], which was broadcasted live on the internet.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2006-07-15]] | url = http://www.caradvice.com.au/528/holden-ve-commodore-launch/ | title = Holden VE Commodore internet launch | publisher = caradvice.com.au | accessdate = 2007-03-12}}</ref> With a sales debut on [[August 14]] [[2006]], it is the first Commodore to be entirely designed and engineered in Australia.<ref>{{cite web | last = Butler | first = Glenn | date = [[2006-08-14]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=19276 | title = Holden VE Commodore release | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-03-09}}</ref> All previous generations from the original [[Holden VB Commodore|VB Commodore]] had been based on [[Europe]]an sourced [[automobile platform|platforms]] from [[Opel]] that had been adapted both mechanically and in size for the local market.

The [[Internal combustion engine|engines]] and [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmissions]] of the VE are mainly carry-overs from the previous [[Holden VZ Commodore|VZ]] model, except for a new six-speed [[automatic transmission]] offered on selected trim levels.<ref>{{cite web | last = Heasley | first = Andrew | date = [[2006-07-17]] | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/new-commodore-1bn-in-the-making/2006/07/16/1152988412446.html | title = Holden VE Commodore carry-over components | publisher = The Age | accessdate = 2007-04-03}}</ref>

Holden released the VE Commodore to the [[New Zealand]] market in September 2006.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2006-07-16]] | url = http://www.holden.co.nz/press/article/79 | title = Holden VE Commodore New Zealand launch | publisher = [[Holden New Zealand]] | accessdate = 2006-11-30}}</ref> This was followed by the achievement of the prestigious ''[[Wheels Car of the Year]]'' award on [[January 23]] [[2007]].<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2007-02-01]] | url = http://wheelsmag.com.au/wheels/a/11B5D96730974B1DCA257282000543A8.html | title = Holden VE Commodore Wheels COTY | publisher = [[Wheels magazine]] | accessdate = 2007-03-10}}</ref> Before the release of the VE model, Holden confirmed that [[station wagon]] and [[coupe utility|utility]] body styles of the VE would not be launched for some time. Holden will instead manufacture two parallel generations of Commodores until the VE variants are released.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2006-08-03]] | url = http://www.caradvice.com.au/670/holden-ve-ute-wagon/ | title = Holden VE Commodore body styles | publisher = caradvice.com.au | accessdate = 2007-01-12}}</ref>

== History of development ==
Holden's designers and engineers began laying down the basics of a clean-sheet Commodore in 1999. In the seven years of development, the car came to be Holden's largest and most costly project representing an expenditure exceeding [[Australian dollar|AU$]]1&nbsp;billion and 3.4&nbsp;million&nbsp;[[kilometre]]s (2.1&nbsp;million&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) of testing.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2006-07-16]] | url = http://www.caradvice.com.au/529/holden-ve-commodore-launched/ | title = Holden VE Commodore development | publisher = caradvice.com.au | accessdate = 2006-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | date = [[2006-07-26]] | url = http://carsguide.news.com.au/story/0,20384,19917167-5009380,00.html | title = Holden VE Commodore testing | publisher = carsguide.news.com.au | accessdate = 2006-11-12}}</ref>

=== Design ===
In 1999, Holden's manager of exterior design, Peter Hughes produced a two-dimensional image of a sketch drawn earlier by Michael Simcoe, Holden's design director at the time. Known in house as the "Bill of Design", the sketch formed the design basis for the production ready car. Various elements of the sketch were changed, including the rear [[automotive lighting#Rear position lamps (tail lamps)|tail lamps]], the low-profile side window cluster and the drawn out [[wheelbase]], but the aggressive stance remained.<ref name = WheelsVEMag>{{Citation | last = Newton | first = Bruce | last2 = Robinson | first2 = Peter | last3 = McCarthy | first3 = Mike | last4 = McKay | first4 = Peter | title = 2006 Collector's Edition VE Commodore: The Full Story | publisher = [[Australian Consolidated Press]] | journal = [[Wheels magazine]] | pages = 34<U+2013>41, 44<U+2013>46, 32, 94 | date = October 2006}}</ref>

Several [[automobile safety|safety]] initiatives were implemented in the design of the new Commodore. One of these being the [[fuel tank]] that would be located ahead of the rear-axle line, instead of behind.<ref>{{cite web | last = Dowling | first = Joshua | date = [[2006-04-07]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=11410 | title = Holden VE Commodore design process | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2006-10-31}}</ref> A more crash-resistant rear-end structure was seen necessary. The design though would have to incorporate a spacious boot and a spare-wheel bay that could house the largest sized wheel to be fitted to the car.

[[Image:HoldenVE99Sketch.jpg|thumb|left|Early 1999 design sketch by Peter Hughes formed the basis for VE Commodore profile.]]

In 2004, just two years prior to the release of the VE Commodore, the [[Holden Torana#Torana TT36|Torana TT36]] [[concept car]] was unveiled at the Australian International Motor Show in [[Sydney]]. The TT36 served as a preview of the VE and gauge public reaction to the styling. Much of the Torana<U+2019>s fundamental styling draws from the VE design essence, including some production ready components carrying over from the TT36. Such components include the [[steering wheel]], window and [[rear-view mirror]] switch cluster, and [[handbrake]] lever.<ref name = WheelsVEMag/>

=== Engineering ===
Shortly after the first design sketches were penned, Holden engineers began work on [[chassis]] development. These initial stages of development saw Holden face a dilemma. Opel, the company which had provided the basis for all previous Commodore generations had ceased production of their [[rear-wheel drive]] [[Opel Omega|Omega]], therefore leaving Holden with the decision of either developing an all-new vehicle, or using another platform sourced from within General Motors.<ref>{{cite web | last = Hull | first = Nick | date = [[2006-07-28]] | url = http://www.cardesignnews.com/site/home/first_sight/display/store4/item44783/ | title = Holden's adoption of an all-new Commodore | publisher = cardesignnews.com | accessdate = 2007-01-27}}</ref> At the time, GM was readying its new premium rear-wheel drive [[GM Sigma platform|Sigma platform]], to later make a debut in the 2002 [[Cadillac CTS]]. Holden's engineers were offered this platform but ultimately decided it was not what they were after.<ref>{{cite web | last = Butler | first = Glenn | date = [[2006-07-17]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=18505 | title = Holden VE Commodore design | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2006-10-31}}</ref> The Sigma platform<U+2019>s [[double wishbone suspension|double A-arm]] front suspension and extensive use of [[aluminium]] was too costly for a car that was to be sold for around AU$35,000. The luggage compartment was deemed too small, and the Sigma interior package could not be stretched sufficiently to become a family-sized car, particularly the rear-seat shoulder width being too tight.

<!-- FAIR USE of HoldenVE03Sketch.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:HoldenVE03Sketch.jpg for rationale -->
[[Image:HoldenVE03Sketch.jpg|thumb|2003 design sketch of the Commodore SS V displays near final styling, showing only slight differences to [[hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] and side vents.]]
These major drawbacks made the decision to develop an all new platform essential, which became known as the [[GM Zeta platform]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.leftlanenews.com/2006/09/01/billion-dollar-baby-creating-the-holden-commodore-and-zeta-platform/ | title = Holden VE Commodore Zeta platform | publisher = Leftlane News | accessdate = 2006-10-31}}</ref> A number of forthcoming General Motors vehicles will employ the platform, which has already replaced the [[GM V platform (RWD)|GM V-body]] and will eventually replace the [[front-wheel drive]] [[GM W platform|W-body]], [[GM K platform (FWD)|K-Body]] and [[GM G platform (FWD)|G-body]] platforms after 2010.

Another contentious issue was engine packaging: Holden's designers wanted the engine positioned well behind the front [[axle]] to create short overhangs and an overall sportier appearance. However, the crash engineers were concerned that this would limit the room needed to absorb impact energy in the event of an accident. Negotiation between designers and crash engineers resulted in moving of some of the engine components <U+2014> such as the battery <U+2014> into the boot, thus freeing up valuable front-end space. While not achieving the design department's original targets, the new compromise retained much of the sporting profile while meeting crash standards.<ref>{{cite web | last = Newton | first = Bruce | date = [[2006-07-25]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=18754 | title = Holden VE Commodore engineering boss Tony Hyde | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2006-10-31}}</ref> By moving the engine back and further down, the VE Commodore also benefits from near perfect 50:50 [[weight distribution]] across all variants, leading to superior handling.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2006-07-24]] | url = http://www.holden.co.nz/press/article/90 | title = Holden VE Commodore chassis and suspension | publisher = [[Holden New Zealand]] | accessdate = 2006-10-31}}</ref>

The [[GM High Feature engine|Alloytec]] [[V6 engine]] introduced in the VZ Commodore was originally intended to be first fitted to the VE. However, Holden was concerned that introducing a new platform and drivetrain at the same time would be a risky proposition. As a result, the Alloytec V6 was first introduced in the proven VZ model and allowing Holden to address any issues or faults before fitting it to the VE. The decision proved prudent and a refined version of the engine was introduced for the new platform, featuring some updated components as well as giving five<U+2013>seven&nbsp;[[watt|kilowatts]] (7<U+2013>9&nbsp;[[Horsepower|hp]]) more power.<ref name = overview>{{cite web | last = Knowling | first = Michael | date = [[2006-08-28]] | url = http://autospeed.drive.com.au/cms/A_3028/article.html | title = Holden VE Commodore overview | publisher = autospeed.drive.com.au | accessdate = 2007-03-06}}</ref>

=== Innovations ===
[[Denny Mooney]] was appointed [[chairman]] of Holden in September 2003. At this stage, development was well under way. Key design and engineering work was being finalised, and money being spent on cutting the tooling used to manufacture the car. One of Mooney's foremost endeavours was to improve the perceived quality issues that surrounded the previous generations of Commodores. The interior quality benefited dramatically from this additional emphasis; Mooney pushed for panel gaps to be reduced by a further 0.5&nbsp;[[millimetre]]s (0.02&nbsp;[[Inch|in]]) over previous targets.<ref name = WheelsVEMag/><ref>{{cite web | last = Hagon | first = Toby | date = [[2006-07-17]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=18482 | title = Holden VE Commodore interior | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-03-29}}</ref> Smaller panel gaps are just one of the ways that Holden have developed the VE to pitch it against the European competitors. Through the use of advanced [[steel]]s and intensive design, the body structure is 50% [[Stiffness|stiffer]] than the outgoing model, benefiting from noise and vibration reductions, [[Car handling|handling]] and crash safety.<ref>{{cite web | last = Hagon | first = Toby | date = [[2006-07-25]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=18750 | title = Holden VE Commodore body structure | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-04-11}}</ref> However the new body has resulted in substantially increased weight over the outgoing model.<ref name= DriveVEMag>{{cite web | url = http://www.drive.com.au/downloads/VEMagHighRes.pdf | title = Holden VE Commodore design process | work = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2006-10-31}}</ref>

[[Image:Holden_VE_Clay_Model.jpg|thumb|Full-size clay model created near completion of CAD work. A 1997 [[Holden VT Commodore|VT]] clay model can be seen in the background.]]

The development of the new car led Holden to redesign the [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]] plant in [[South Australia]] so that entire sections of the car can be assembled off the foremost production line. This new production method allows for complete sub-sections like the engine and transmissions to be constructed seamlessly together on rigs that simplify production. This process is applied to the front-end module of the VE Commodore, consisting of the [[headlamp|headlights]], [[bumper]]s, [[airbag]] sensors and other accessory components. It can be easily removed as one-piece leading to lower [[Auto mechanic|repair costs]] and easier access to the engine bay.<ref>{{cite web | last = Newton | first = Bruce | date = [[2006-07-25]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=18752 | title = Holden VE Commodore front end | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2006-11-01}}</ref> This design represents the first time such a method has been used within General Motors, and garnered the [[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] Australasia's 2006 ''Automotive Engineering Excellence Award''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sae-a.com.au/awards.htm | title = Holden VE Commodore Automotive Engineering Excellence Awards 2006 | publisher = [[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] Australasia | accessdate = 2006-11-01}}</ref> A modular design structure known within Holden as "flex strategy" has been applied to the interior where fundamentally different components such as audio units and instrument clusters can be swapped out for the different Commodore variants, creating radically varied interior look and feel without much higher costs.<ref name = DriveVEMag/> The upshot of this is much greater differentiation between the variants than the outgoing model creating three distinct interior looks, dubbed Functional, Performance and Luxury.

Additional detail touches were added to the VE, such as a new four-strut hinge system for the boot (as used on upmarket European models) to replace space intrusive, much maligned "gooseneck" hinges as used on previous Commodores.<ref>{{cite web | last = Newton | first = Bruce | date = [[2006-07-17]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=18524 | title = Holden VE Commodore new features | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2006-11-12}}</ref> High-specification variants see expandable door pockets and a [[Saab Automobile|Saab]]-like "blackout" feature which illuminates only the [[speedometer]] at night to enhance driver focus on the road.<ref name = DriveVEMag/> An innovative flush-fitting handbrake set into a symmetrical centre console means the lever can be easily reversed to sit on the opposite side of [[Center console (automobile)|console]] for [[Driving on the left or right|left-hand drive]] export markets, minimising redesign costs.<ref name = DriveVEMag/>

Another first for the Commodore are the ''V-Series'' variants for selected models, providing a fully optioned version of the respective specification level. This was largely due to a fully optioned [[Holden VZ Commodore#Commodore SS|Commodore SS]] in the VZ range known as the ''[[Holden VZ Commodore#Commodore SSZ|SSZ]]'' being rather successful.<ref name = V-Series>{{cite web | last = Hagon | first = Toby | date = [[2006-07-16]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=18448 | title = Holden VE Commodore V-Series | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-02-24}}</ref> Before the VE, the SS badge was a well-known flagship name, and the SV8 model was a lower-spec version of the SS. For the VE, Holden essentially [[badge engineering|rebadged]] the [[Holden VZ Commodore#Commodore SV8|SV8]] as the SS, and used the new SS V name to replace the old SS specification level.

== Engine and mechanicals ==
[[Image:Holden VE Berlina 01.jpg|thumb|VE Berlina shown with the dual-fuel option which is able to run on [[Autogas|LPG]] and regular 91 [[Octane rating|RON]] [[Gasoline|petrol]] demonstrating the vehicle's [[parktronic]] system.]]
Six-cylinder variants receive a revised version of the Australian-built [[GM High Feature engine|Alloytec V6 engine]]. Power has increased over the VZ Commodore and engine noise reduced by using new timing chains, among other modifications. [[Fuel economy in automobiles|Fuel economy]] figures for variants utilizing the 180&nbsp;kilowatt (241&nbsp;hp) V6 show a small reduction in consumption over the previous Alloytec engines, bringing it into line with its then current rival, the [[Ford BF Falcon]] at 10.9&nbsp;L/100&nbsp;km (21.6&nbsp;mpg U.S.). Fuel consumption results for other variants are mixed when compared to VZ models, due primarily to increased weight.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2006-07-24]] | url = http://www.holden.co.nz/news/article/88 | title = Holden VE Commodore fuel economy | publisher = [[Holden New Zealand]] | accessdate = 2006-10-27}}</ref>

An updated version of the long-serving four-speed automatic transmission remains for the 180&nbsp;kilowatt (241&nbsp;hp) V6. A modified version of the [[GM LS engine#L76|L76 V8]] engine is also carried-over, producing an extra 10&nbsp;kilowatts (13&nbsp;hp) of power. This new engine, designated ([[GM LS engine#L98|L98]]) does not readily support fuel-saving [[Active Fuel Management|Displacement on Demand]] technology, unlike the L76.<ref>{{cite web | last = Newton | first = Bruce | date = [[2006-09-20]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=20165&vf=1 | title = Holden VE Commodore L98 engine | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-01-12}}</ref>

In October 2006, Holden introduced a dual-fuel version of the Alloytec V6, able to run on both petrol and [[autogas|LPG]]. Featuring an advanced Sequential Vapour Gas Injection (SVGI) system and hardened [[valve seat]]s to cope, the new V6 produces five&nbsp;kilowatts (7&nbsp;hp) and five&nbsp;[[newton metre]]s (5&nbsp;[[foot-pound force|ft<U+00B7>lbf]]) less than the conventional V6 when run on LPG, for a total of 175&nbsp;kilowatts (235&nbsp;hp).<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2006-10-19]] | url = http://www.caradvice.com.au/997/holden-dual-fuel-now-in-ve-range-lpg/ | title = Holden VE Commodore dual-fuel | publisher = caradvice.com.au | accessdate = 2006-11-12}}</ref> Although LPG prices are lower, the engine uses a large 100&nbsp;[[kilogram]] (220&nbsp;lb) cylindrical gas tank which causes decreased boot space and slightly increased fuel consumption.

Holden was able to take advantage of a small loophole in government legislation, allowing an AU$2,000 rebate on LPG installation because the unit is fitted post-production by Holden's customisation arm ''HSVi''. Normally, people would only be entitled to a AU$1,000 rebate for new cars pre-installed with LPG.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ausindustry.gov.au/content/level3index.cfm?ObjectID=D47685C8-0B0B-459C-B07A2EFBDB3D4AF7&L2Parent= | title = Government LPG rebate policy | publisher = AusIndustry | accessdate = 2006-12-11}}</ref> The dual-fuel option is available on the Commodore Omega, Berlina and the soon to be discontinued [[Holden VZ Commodore#Commodore Executive|VZ Executive]] station wagon.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2006-12-01]] | url = http://www.southgate.com.au/lpg.htm | title = Holden VE Commodore dual-fuel | publisher = Southgate Holden | accessdate = 2006-11-12}}</ref>

Transmission options comprise of the [[Aisin AY6 transmission|Aisin AY6]] and [[Borg-Warner T-56|Tremec T-56]] six-speed [[manual transmission|manuals]], the four-speed automatic [[GM 4L60-E transmission|GM 4L60E]], and the five-speed automatic [[GM 5L40-E transmission|GM 5L40E]]. The [[GM 6L80 transmission|GM 6L80E]] six-speed automatic transmission is offered on variants sporting the 6.0&nbsp;litre V8 engine. Both the five and six-speed automatics feature [[tiptronic|Active Select]] controls allowing manual gear selection. Having undergone significant revisions, the T-56 gains extra [[manual transmission#Synchromesh|synchromesh]], shorter [[clutch]] action and a more tightly-spaced M10 gearset shared with the [[Chevrolet SSR]].<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2006-07-24]] | url = http://www.holden.co.nz/news/article/92 | title = Holden VE Commodore gearset shared with Chevrolet SSR | publisher = [[Holden New Zealand]] | accessdate = 2006-10-27}}</ref>

New double-pivot [[MacPherson strut]] front suspension and a [[multi-link suspension|four-link]] [[independent suspension|independent rear suspension]] have been introduced to replace the previous simple MacPherson strut design front and much criticised [[trailing arm|semi-trailing arm]] rear suspension for dramatically improved ride and handling.<ref name= DriveVEMag/>

{{Main|Specification levels of the Holden VE Commodore}}
=== Commodore Omega ===
Replacing the outgoing Commodore Executive and Acclaim, the Omega offers a halfway point in terms of equipment levels. The most significant gain over the Executive is the [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Electronic Stability Control|Electronic Stability Program]] (ESP) 8.0 system, now standard across the range.<ref name = overview/> Again like all VE models, the Omega uses a spacesaver spare tyre. A full-sized, matching 16&nbsp;inch (400&nbsp;mm) spare tyre is available as an optional extra.<ref name = features>{{cite web | last = McKinnon | first = Bill | date = [[2006-08-19]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=19420&vf=3 | title = Holden VE Commodore specification levels | publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | accessdate = 2007-03-09}}</ref>

=== Commodore SV6 ===
Building on the Omega, the SV6 is equipped with a more powerful 195&nbsp;kilowatt variant of the Alloytec V6, coupled to an Aisin six-speed manual transmission. Air conditioning, a key feature missing on the Omega, comes standard on the SV6. A body kit and sports suspension similar to the V8 Commodore SS/SS V variants is also fitted. The SV6 sports the ''Performance'' interior look, characterised by an accentuated matte black center console and red lighting, as opposed to the silver Functional-style interior of the Omega.<ref name = features/>

=== Commodore SS ===
[[Image:Holden V-Series logo.jpg|thumb|Holden V-Series insignia, as used on the SS and Calais V-Series editions.]]
Offering similar equipment levels to the SV6, the Commodore SS uses the 6.0&nbsp;litre V8 engine and T-56 six-speed manual transmission. The SS is recognisable from its quad [[Exhaust pipe|exhaust outlets]] in place of the SV6 dual outlets. The resulting specification level is much higher than the outgoing minimalist SV8 and only missing a few cosmetic touches of the previous flagship Commodore SS.<ref name = features/>

=== Commodore SS V-Series ===
Sitting at the top of hierarchy in the sports sector, the SS V-Series represents the first time this type of naming has been applied to Holden products. The V-Series naming is reminiscent of the [[Cadillac V-Series|V-badging]] on selected [[Cadillac]] models, another member of the General Motors family. The badge design on the bootlid bears strong resemblance to the ones used by Cadillac. But whereas Cadillac uses it to signify high-performance versions of its products, Holden V-Series variants boast extra features.<ref name = V-Series/>

Based on the Commodore SS variant, the SS V offers extra luxuries at a similar price point to the old SS. Inside, the SS V is recognisable by the [[metal]]lic look pedals and instruments matched with the exterior colour. Additionally, the entire dashboard can be optioned in a range of loud colours: bright red, orange or black.<ref name = WheelsVEMag/> The SS V exterior is equally adventurous, exhibiting five-spoke 19&nbsp;inch (480&nbsp;mm) alloy wheels and the option of larger 20&nbsp;inch (500&nbsp;mm) wheels: the largest wheels ever fitted to a Holden car.<ref name = features/>

=== Berlina ===
[[Image:Holden VE Berlina interior 01.jpg|thumb|Luxury-type interior of the Berlina with the trademark flush-fitting handbrake lever and [[wood grain]] highlights.]]
Priced lower than the outgoing model, the second tier Berlina retains a similar amount of equipment. The exterior styling is similar to the Omega but gaining extra touches such as front [[Automotive lighting#Foglamps|fog lamps]] and seven-spoke 17&nbsp;inch (430&nbsp;mm) alloy wheels. It features the Luxury-type interior with a large [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] centre display and is the only model in the VE range that uses [[wood grain]] highlights.<ref name = features/>

=== Calais ===
Like the Berlina, the Calais retains the features of the outgoing model but at a significantly lower price point. Offering a blend of luxury and sporting character, it pairs the 195&nbsp;kilowatt V6 of the SV6 with the five-speed automatic transmission. Unlike the previous model Calais which featured a semi-sport suspension setup known as ''FE1.5'', the VE shares the Commodore SS/SS V stiff sports suspension.<ref name = features/>

=== Calais V-Series ===
Based on the Calais, the V-Series edition shares Luxury-style interior of the Berlina and Calais, but adds real aluminium highlights. Being the flagship of the Commodore range, it comes with everything the VE has to offer and serves as a stepping stone to the luxury long-wheelbase [[Holden WM Statesman|Statesman]]/[[Holden WM Caprice|Caprice]] range.<ref name = features/>

== Market ==
[[Image:2008 Pontiac G8 GT Chicago ShowCar.JPG|thumb|The VE Commodore will be sold in the United States as the [[Pontiac G8|G8]] under the [[Pontiac]] nameplate.]]
At the time of launch in Australia, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford<U+2019>s]] [[Ford BF Falcon|BF Falcon]] directly competed with the VE Commodore. Ford has since revised its Falcon line-up, and in November 2006 [[Toyota]] released their key [[Toyota Aurion|Aurion]] model to the Australian market.<ref>{{cite web | last = Stanford | first = James | date = [[2006-10-20]] | url = http://carsguide.news.com.au/story/0,20384,20614376-5003140,00.html | title = Ford BFII Falcon update | publisher = carsguide.news.com.au | accessdate = 2007-02-21}}</ref> The [[Mitsubishi 380]] may also indirectly compete with the Holden Commodore.<ref>{{cite web | last = Montgomery | first = Garth | date = [[2006-11-03]] | url = http://carsguide.news.com.au/story/0,20384,20694142-5009380,00.html | title = Holden VE Commodore competition and sales | publisher = carsguide.news.com.au | accessdate = 2007-02-21}}</ref>

Market for the VE Commodore extends further than Australia. Designed with export markets in mind, VE Commodores are sold in New Zealand, the [[Middle East]] and [[South Africa]]. For the latter two markets, they are rebadged as the [[Chevrolet Lumina (Australia)|Chevrolet Lumina]] and marketed alongside the [[Holden WM Statesman|WM Statesman]]/[[Holden WM Caprice|Caprice]]-based [[Chevrolet Caprice (Australia)|Chevrolet Caprice]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.drivearabia.com/chevrolet/chevroletlumina07.html | title = Holden VE Commodore sold under the Chevrolet namebadge in the Middle East and South Africa | publisher = Drive Arabia | accessdate = 2006-11-24}}</ref> [[Shanghai GM]] announced that a WM Statesman derived [[Buick Park Avenue (China)|Buick Park Avenue]] will be manufactured for the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] market, utilizing Australian-built versions of the [[GM High Feature engine]].

GM and Holden confirmed V6 and V8 versions of the Commodore will be exported to the [[United States]] as the 2008 [[Pontiac G8]] to replace the ageing [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], in a deal to last the life cycle of the car.<ref>{{cite web | last = Dowling | first = Joshua | date = [[2007-01-09]] | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/holdens-cat-out-of-bag--ss-off-to-america/2007/01/08/1168104921065.html | title = Holden VE Commodore to be sold as Pontiac G8 | publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | accessdate = 2007-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Butler | first = Glenn | date = [[2007-02-08]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=29015 | title = Holden confirms export deal to US | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-02-08}}</ref> This announcement coincided with a [[Pontiac]] unveiling at the 2007 [[Chicago Auto Show]]. VE Commodores have also been sampled by [[Opel]] in [[Germany]], while Opel's equivalent in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] has expressed interest in importing [[Holden Special Vehicles|HSV]] modified versions, announcing their plans to sell the HSV Clubsport R8 as the 2007 [[Vauxhall VXR8]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Lumsdon | first = Rory | date = [[2007-02-26]] | url = http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/Vauxhall-Concepts/224242/ | title = Vauxhall to import HSV Clubsport R8 | publisher = Haymarket Motoring | accessdate = 2007-02-28}}</ref>

== Issues and criticism ==
The fitment of a space-saver tyre to all models across the range has come under heavy criticism, as Holden is the first manufacturer to fit a temporary spare tyre to an Australian-built car. The tyre can be driven for 500&nbsp;kilometres (300&nbsp;mi) at a maximum speed of 80&nbsp;[[kilometres per hour]] (50&nbsp;mph). Concerns have been raised by the public over its usefulness in remote Australian [[outback]] areas, far from any tyre repair centres and asserts that it is a cost-cutting measure.<ref>{{cite web | last = Dowling | first = Joshua | coauthors = Hudson, Jaedene | date = [[2006-07-21]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?articleID=18630&vf=3 | title = Holden VE Commodore spare tyre | publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | accessdate = 2007-03-12}}</ref> Similar concerns have been raised in the media, although Holden maintains that this is a weight-saving feature and allows for full-size spare tyres to be purchased at an additional cost.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2006-07-21]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=18632 | title = Holden VE Commodore misled over tyres? | publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | accessdate = 2006-11-12}}</ref><ref name = VEreview>{{cite web | last = McGrath | first = Gavin | coauthors = Smith, Graham; Stanford, James | date = [[2006-08-25]] | url = http://carsguide.news.com.au/story/0,20384,20226626-5009380,00.html | title = Holden VE Commodore review | publisher = carsguide.news.com.au | accessdate = 2006-11-12}}</ref>

On the base Omega model, air conditioning is an extra-cost option. Critics have seen this as unforgivable considering Australia is a country well known for its overall hot climate and especially since its Falcon and Aurion rivals have it as standard.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2006-07-20]] | url = http://www.caradvice.com.au/561/holden-ve-commodore-pricing/ | title = Holden VE Commodore features and pricing | publisher = caradvice.com.au | accessdate = 2007-03-06}}</ref>

Concerns have also been levelled at VE fuel consumption figures, where the heavier body has negatively impacted and produced mixed official fuel economy results, particularly for [[V8 engine|V8]] variants.<ref>{{cite web | last = Butler | first = Glenn | date = [[2006-07-24]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=18700 | title = Holden VE Commodore fuel economy mixed results | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2006-11-12}}</ref> Arch-rival Ford has taken advantage of this to criticise the Commodore, as its latest Ford BFII Falcon update brings improved fuel consumption figures of 10.7&nbsp;L/100&nbsp;km (22.0&nbsp;mpg U.S.) for the base XT model and 10.2&nbsp;L/100&nbsp;km (23.1&nbsp;mpg U.S.) with an optional six-speed automatic.<ref>{{cite web | last = Hudson | first = Jaedene | date = [[2006-08-18]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=19378 | title = Ford taunts Holden over fuel consumption | publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | accessdate = 2006-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Hepworth | first = Kevin | date = [[2006-10-04]] | url = http://carsguide.news.com.au/story/0,20384,20534214-5003140,00.html | title = Ford Falcon fuel consumption | publisher = carsguide.news.com.au | accessdate = 2006-11-12}}</ref> Real-world testing have confirmed the difference in fuel consumption.<ref name = VEreview/><ref>{{cite web | last = King | first = Philip | coauthors = Wilson, Robert | date = [[2006-10-25]] | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20637004-13232,00.html | title = Holden VE Commodore vs Ford | publisher = [[The Australian]] | accessdate = 2006-11-12}}</ref>

The introduction of the new model has resulted in a few embarrassing "teething" issues. The Commodore has been recalled twice since its release. The initial [[October 16]] [[2006]] recall affecting 1,521 V8 Commodore, Statesman and Caprice models involved a faulty fuel hose, causing a fuel smell to enter the cabin.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.recalls.gov.au/view_recall_detail.php?Recall_ID_Auto=14434 | title = Holden VE Commodore October 2006 recall | publisher = Product Recalls Australia | accessdate = 2006-11-12}}</ref> A second [[November 10]] [[2006]] recall affecting 12,830 early-build Commodores, Statesmans and Caprices resulted from defective rear [[seatbelt]] anchors.<ref>{{cite web | last = Pettendy | first = Marton | date = [[2006-11-10]] | url = http://goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/4FFFD14B063A815ECA2572220015558F | title = Holden VE Commodore November 2006 recall | publisher = GoAuto | accessdate = 2006-11-12}}</ref>
