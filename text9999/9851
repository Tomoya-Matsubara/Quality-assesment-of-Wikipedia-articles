A member of a championship team, Kay Rohrer was one of the best hitting catchers during her only season in the league, ranking among the top 10 players in multiple offensive categories.<ref>'''All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book''' <U+2013> [[W.C. Madden|W. C. Madden]]. Publisher: [[McFarland & Company]], [[2000 in baseball|2000]]. Format: [[Hardcover]], 294pp. Language: [[English language|English]]. ISBN 0-7864-0597-x</ref> 

Born in [[Los Angeles, California]], Kay grew up in a baseball oriented family. Her father, [[William Rohrer]], was a [[minor league baseball|minor league]] catcher who eventually would [[manager (baseball)|manage]] in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, while her grandfather, Ulysses Rohrer, was a 19th-century minor leaguer. At an early age, she served as a [[mascot]] and [[batboy|batgirl]] for a team managed by her father. She spent the majority of the time following her father around at the ballpark.<ref>[http://www.aagpbl.org/index.cfm/profiles/rohrer-william/795 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League official website <U+2013>  William Rohrer profile]</ref>

In 1938, her sophomore year in high school, Rohrer was 14 years old when she started playing [[softball]] in a girls team sponsored by Cantala-Tanzola, transporters of bulk petroleum company. The team was managed by her father. But she was not the only young lady whose star was on the rise. Her teammate, [[Dottie Wiltse Collins|Dorothy Wiltse]], would become one of the most dominant pitchers in AAGPBL history. Due in part to Mr. Rohrer guide, the girls became a key component for Cantala-Tanzala since they operated together as one well-assembled, pitcher-catcher [[battery (baseball)|battery]].<ref>'''Dottie Wiltse Collins: Strikeout Queen of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League''' <U+2013> Carolyn M. Trombe. Publisher: [[McFarland & Company]], [[2005 in baseball|2005]]. Format: [[Paperback|Softcover]], 208pp. Language: [[English language|English]].

In an interview, a mature Wiltse explained that Kay "would sit on her haunches without moving and just take her arm and, 'whoo', throw out people at second base just like that". At the time, such headlines as "Kid Battery Opposes Vets" and "Kid Battery Performs Today" raced across the sports pages in the Los Angeles newspapers. One write-up noted "The 'baby battery' swings into action tonight. Dot Wiltse and Kay Rohrer, pitcher and catcher who form the battery for Cantlay Tanzola, are fourteen years old but figure to give Bank of America a run for its money in their softball clash at Fiedler Sunset Field."<ref name=DWC>Dottie Wiltse Collins: Strikeout Queen of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League</ref>

Nevertheless, Kay was not just a talented ballplayer, she was also a beautiful woman. In 1941 she was interviewed by [[Harry Cohn]], president and production director of [[Columbia Pictures]], who invited her into their studios for a photo shoot and to discuss a contract. To groom her for the stardom that never came, Kay was featured in several movie magazines.<ref name=ASFHoF>{{cite web |url=http://www.arizonasoftballfoundation.org/women/rohrer-kay.html# |title= Kay Rohrer photo gallery}}</ref> She also was under contract with [[Paramount Pictures]] and later with [[List of early color feature films|Technicolor Corporation]], before joining the league in 1945 with the [[Rockford Peaches]].<ref name=AAGPBL/><ref name=DWC/>

During the [[1945 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League season|1945 season]], the strong pitching led to depressed [[batting average]]s in the AAGPBL, as the six teams combined for a .188 mark. A record nine [[no-hitter]]s were hurled during the season, including a [[perfect game]] by Rockford's [[Carolyn Morris]], while [[Racine Belles]]' [[Mary Nesbitt Wisham|Mary Nesbitt]] was the only hitter to top the .300 mark (.319). Rohrer tied for seventh in average with her teammate [[Dorothy Harrell]] and Racine's [[Sophie Kurys]] at .239, and also tied for second in [[home run]]s (2) and for eight in [[double (baseball)|doubles]] (8). The Peaches, managed by [[Bill Allington]], became the first team to win both the season title and the championship in league history. Rohrer scored three runs and hit .185 (5-for-27) in nine postseason games, while her [[run batted in|RBI]]-[[Triple (baseball)|triple]] in Game 1 of the final series proved to be the winning run in a 2<U+2013>1 victory against the [[Fort Wayne Daisies]].<ref name=RecordBook>All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book</ref><ref>[http://www.aagpbl.org/index.cfm/teams/1945/rockford-peaches/11 1945 Rockford Peaches]</ref>

After her AAGPBL days Rohrer moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona]], where she achieved a distinguished career in the Arizona Softball League. She earned All-American honors in 1948 while leading the A-1 Queens of Phoenix to the national championship. She also played with the Phoenix Westerners, Mesa Premiums, Funk Gems and Phoenix Ramblers from 1954 through 1962, helping the Ramblers to three runner-up spots in national tournaments. In addition, she appeared in the American Softball Association All-Star Game held at [[Stratford, Connecticut]] in 1961.<ref name=ASFHoF/>

Besides her sporting activities Kay found time to enjoy music and flying as she held a pilots license. She died in 1962 at the early age of 39.<ref name=AAGPBL/>

In 1979, Kay Rohrer received a posthumous induction into the Arizona Softball Hall of Fame. She also form part of ''Women in Baseball'', a permanent display opened in 1988 at the [[Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] in [[Cooperstown, New York]] to honor the entire AAGPBL.<ref>[http://www.arizonasoftballfoundation.org/women/index.php Arizona Softball Foundation Hall of Fame inductees <U+2013> Women players category]</ref>
