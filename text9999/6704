==Contents==
The ''Skanda Upanishad'' is written in the voice of [[Kartikeya]] (Skanda), the [[Hindu]] god of war and the son of [[Shiva]]. The Upanishad is narrated in 15 [[shlokas]] or verses.{{Sfn|Weber|2013|p=171}} Skanda addresses his father Shiva as the Great God (Mahadeva) and says that he is a superior being due to Shiva's grace. He declares himself as ''[[Vij<U+00F1><U+0101>na|vijnana]]'' (knowledge) and Shiva himself. Internal organs conceal the Truth and after their destruction, the god [[Vishnu]] emerges from the ''[[Samvit]]'' (Consciousness or knowledge). Skanda declares himself as the Unborn one and part of the ''Samvit''. All inert things, except the ''[[<U+0100>tman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'' (soul), are destroyers. The "imperishable" ([[Achyuta]], a name of Vishnu) who discerns between consciousness and inertness is identified with ''[[jnana]]'' (knowledge), Shiva, Vishnu, [[Parameshwara (God)|Parameshvara]] (the Supreme God), the Light of Lights and Supreme ''[[Brahman]]'' (Absolute Reality). Skanda declares he is that Brahman.<ref name="warrier">{{cite web | url=http://www.celextel.org/upanishads/krishna_yajur_veda/skanda.html | title=Skanda Upanishad | publisher=The Theosophical Publishing House | accessdate=16 January 2015 | author=Dr. A.

Narayanasvami Aiyar | year=1914}}</ref> He says that he is indestructible.{{Sfn|Parmeshwaranand|2000|p=665}} 

Skanda says that ''[[jiva]]'' (a living being) is Shiva. Just as before husking, it is [[Paddy (unmilled rice)|paddy]] and after husking, a grain is [[rice]], similarly bound by [[karma]], it is a ''jiva'' and when liberated from karma, it becomes Shiva. Skanda then pays his respects to Shiva, who is a form of Vishnu and Vishnu, who is a form of Shiva. Further, Vishnu is said to dwell in the heart of Shiva and vice versa. Shiva and Vishnu are the one and the same.<ref name="warrier"/><ref name="iyer"/>

The ''Skanda Upanishad'' further compares the body to the temple and the ''jiva'' (life-force) to Shiva. Like old flower offerings are cast away from the temple, ''ajnana'' (ignorance, absence of ''jnana'') should be thrown out from the body. God be worshipped by the thought that one is same as Him, which is ''jnana''. ''[[Dhyana]]'' (mediation) should be to rid the mind of objects. Bathing is removing the dirt in the mind. Cleanliness is control over the senses. One must consume the drink of Brahman. One must live on alms and in a solitary place alone and realize the [[Advaita Vedanta|non-duality]] of the Soul and Brahman. Thus, one attains emancipation ([[moksha]]).<ref name="warrier"/><ref name="iyer"/>

A prayer in first person follows. Obeisance is offered to the Supreme Light, wishing for prosperity and longevity. Vishnu as [[Narasimha]] and Shiva as Mahadeva are addressed. The hymn declares that by their grace, people realize the incomprehensible Brahman, which transcends thoughts, is unmanifest and infinite and indestructible, but takes the form of the deities, [[Brahma]], Vishnu and Shiva.<ref name="warrier"/><ref name="iyer"/>

The ''Skanda Upanishad'' ends with the hymn, which is said to lead to salvation:<ref name="Deussen">{{cite book|last= Deussen |first=Paul |title=Sixty Upanishads of the Veda|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XYepeIGUY0gC&pg=PA665|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-1467-7|page=743}}</ref>
{{quote|And the highest step of Vishnu <br>The patrons see for ever<br> Like an eye, stationed in heaven.<br>And wondering over this highest step<br>Of Vishnu, the priests, wide-awake, <br>Enkindle the sacrificial fire.}}

This hymn originates from the [[Rig Veda]] and appears in other Upanishadic texts like [[Aruneya Upanishad]], [[Nrisimha Tapaniya Upanishad]], [[Vasudeva Upanishad]] and [[Muktika]] Upanishad.<ref name="Deussen"/>

==Commentary==
[[File:Harihara V&A.jpg|thumb|Harihara, depicting Vishnu and Shiva as one.]]

Two aphorisms from the ''Skanda Upanishad'': "Shiva is Jiva" and "the body is said to be the temple" are quoted repeatedly. [[Aurobindo]] interprets them to convey that the unmanifested soul within a person should be united with Shiva, that is, Brahman.<ref name="Ananda2013">{{cite book|author=Sri G. Ananda|title=Shiva: A Rediscovery of the Holy Spirit|date=3 December 2013|publisher=Art of Unity|isbn=978-1-4943-6868-5|page=135}}</ref> 

The unity and sameness of Vishnu and Shiva, gods of the rival Hindu sects of [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Shaivism]] respectively, in the text are also emphasized.<ref>{{cite book|title=Upanisads: The Selections from 108 Upanisads|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yluXuM5NuUIC&pg=PA187|year=1975|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-1611-4|page=187}}</ref><ref name="iyer"/> This identification of the two gods is said an attempt of syncretism of the warring sects, similar to the icon of [[Harihara]], the combined form of Vishnu and Shiva.<ref name="Bha<U+1E6D><U+1E6D><U+0101>c<U+0101>ryya1969">{{cite book|author=Harid<U+0101>sa Bha<U+1E6D><U+1E6D><U+0101>c<U+0101>ryya|title=The Cultural Heritage of India: The religious. 1956|year=1969|publisher=Ramakrishna Mission, Institute of Culture|page=50}}</ref>
