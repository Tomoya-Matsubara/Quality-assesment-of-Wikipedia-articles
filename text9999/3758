==Plot==

Kam Kardashian is a web series that follows Kameron, the fictional long-lost lesbian Kardashian sister who was cut off, kicked out, and left to fend for herself. This sticky-fingered vixen loves whiskey and women, and most of all: yearns to re-insert herself into the Kardashian krown by any means possible (whether it be through petty crime, Photoshop, or her slightly unbalanced best friend, Mary Hollis).

==Impact and reception==
===Critical reaction===
While fundraising for Season 2, [[Indiewire]] named ''Kam Kardashian'' '''Project of the Week'''. <ref> [http://www.indiewire.com/article/congrats-to-kam-kardashian-indiewires-project-of-the-week "Congrats to 'Kam Kardashian,' Indiewire's Project of the Week!"], Indiewire, January 9, 2013</ref> [[Tubefilter]] chided, "For my money, Kam is more worthwhile than any of her sisters." <ref>Sam Gutelle, [http://www.tubefilter.com/2013/01/02/kam-kardashian-kim-lesbian-web-series-kickstarter/ "Kam Kardashian is Kim's Jaded Lesbian Sister"], Tubefilter, January 2, 2013</ref>  [[Curve (magazine)]] said, "Mirza and Logan collectively add something flavorful and relevant to the evolution of gay characters simply being themselves and doing regular things". <ref name="curve">Kim Hoffman, [http://www.curvemag.com/Curve-Magazine/Web-Articles-2012/Kam-Kardashian-The-Lesbian-Sister-They-Didnt-Tell-You-About/ "Kim Kardashian: The Lesbian Sister They Didn't Tell You About"], Curve Magazine</ref> Placevine raves, "While I can't tell if it's entirely scripted or totally improv (always a good sign of quality acting and direction), it's hilarious... star Fawzia Mirza makes it all seem so fresh, especially with its uniquely LGBTQ spin." <ref>[http://www.placevine.com/article/2013/01/04/2094/kam-kardashian "Daily Scoop: Kam Kardashian], Placevine</ref>

===Series intent===
After debuting the satirical comedy, the creators of the show addressed their intent. "One thing that was really important... was not to do "mean-spirited" comedy," says Mirza, who ultimately respects the famous family for their savvy "force in popular culture." And considering the Kardashians frequently wind up as the butt of a joke (no pun intended) on late-night television, it was important to establish a character in ''Kam Kardashian'' that made sense to anyone watching it.<ref name="curve" />

Director, Ryan Logan, commented, "At the end of the day, Kam is just trying to live up to her family's legacy and gain her parents' approval. We can all identify with that. Hers just happens to be the most famous family on the planet. She's flawed and, compared with her family and "proper society" at large, stratospherically an outsider." <ref>Ryan Logan, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ryan-logan/sugar-spice-and-everything-nice-the-recipe-for-making-a-queer-celebrity_b_2412648.html "Sugar, Spice, and Everything Nice: The Recipe for Making a Gay Celebrity], The Huffington Post, January 4, 2013</ref>
