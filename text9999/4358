[[File:Radio Network House implosion.ogv|thumb|Radio Network House was imploded on 5 August 2012]]
The '''implosion of Radio Network House''' on 5 August 2012 was New Zealand's first ever controlled building [[demolition]] by explosives. Like most other buildings in the [[Christchurch Central City]], Radio Network House was damaged beyond repair in the 22 February [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]], and the [[Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority]] (CERA) added it to the demolition list in August 2011. In July 2012, it was announced that the building is going to be [[Building implosion|imploded]], involving a specialist company from America with a large track record for this type of work.  The right to push the button for the implosion was put up for auction on the [[TradeMe]] website, and became the auction with the third highest page views ever. The winning bid of {{NZ$|26,000|link=yes}} was made by a consortium of demolition contractors, who allowed the [[Child Cancer Foundation]] to nominate a six-year-old boy from [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] to trigger the event. The implosion, which was carefully monitored to assess the suitability of this approach for potential future applications, went without any problems and it is anticipated that this will have paved the way for many more implosions in New Zealand in general, and in Christchurch in particular.

==Background==
[[File:Radio Network House, June 2012.JPG|thumb|upright|Radio Network House in June 2012, displaying the [[Newstalk ZB]] logo]]
Radio Network House was a 14-storey office tower constructed in 1986.<ref name="Engineering N-R">{{cite news|last=Post|first=Nadine M.|title=Quake-Damaged Building Implosion One for the Books|url=http://enr.construction.com/buildings/building_types/2012/quake-damaged-implosion-could-be-a-textbook-case.asp|accessdate=27 August 2012|newspaper=Engineering News-Record|date=6 August 2012}}</ref> The building was located at 155 Worcester Street, on the north side of the street and in the block between Manchester Street and [[Latimer Square]].<ref name="17 Jul - First">{{cite news |last=Turner |first=Anna |title=Newstalk ZB's Radio Network House To Be Imploded |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/7285877/Newstalk-building-to-be-imploded |accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=[[The Press]]|date=17 July 2012 |location=Christchurch |page=A7}}</ref>  For its last twelve years Radio Network House was owned by Greg Hedges through his company Nor West Arch No.4 Ltd.<ref name="6 Aug - bittersweet moment">{{cite news|title=Building blast a bittersweet moment |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/7420297/Building-blast-a-bittersweet-moment |accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=[[The Press]]|date=6 August 2012|location=Christchurch|page=A1}}</ref>

The building was first operated as the Christchurch studio for [[Television New Zealand]] (TVNZ), who displayed their logo on the building. Shows such as ''[[What Now]]'',<ref>{{cite web |last=Simon |first=Annie |title=What Now? - Christmas Special |url= http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/what-now-christmas-special-1991/background |publisher=NZ on Screen |accessdate=22 November 2012}}</ref> ''[[After School (TV series)|After School]]'',<ref>{{cite web |last=Simon |first=Annie |title=After School - Thingee Takes |url= http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/after-school-thingee-takes-1987/background |publisher=NZ on Screen |accessdate=22 November 2012}}</ref> [[Simon Barnett]]'s quiz show ''Face the Music'' and later ''[[The Son of a Gunn Show]]''<ref>{{cite web |title=The Son of a Gunn Show |url= http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/the-son-of-a-gunn-show-1992/series |publisher=NZ on Screen |accessdate=21 November 2012}}</ref> were filmed in the tower block.  TVNZ vacated the building in late 1998 following a decision to move all of their Christchurch-produced shows to Wellington.  In the late 1990s, [[Telstra New Zealand]], the telecommunications company of [[Telstra]] in New Zealand, owned the [[naming rights]] to the building. After [[Clear Communications]] was acquired in December 2001 to form [[TelstraClear]], the Clear logo was prominently displayed on the building.<ref>{{cite web |title=Telstra announces sale of TelstraClear to Vodafone New Zealand |url= http://www.telstraclear.co.nz/company-info/media-release-template.cfm?newsid=448 |publisher=[[TelstraClear]] |accessdate=22 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=TelstraClear Limited |url= http://www.insideview.com/directory/telstraclear-limited |publisher=InsideView, Inc. |accessdate=21 November 2012}}</ref>  The building's naming rights were sold to [[The Radio Network]] and it was renamed to Radio Network House during the ownership of Nor West Arch No.4 Ltd.  At the time of demolition the logo of [[Newstalk ZB]], a subsidiary of The Radio Network, was displayed on the building.<ref name="17 Jul - First" />

The [[Canterbury Region|Canterbury]] region was hit by a series of earthquakes, and the 22 February [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]] damaged the office building beyond repair.<ref name="17 Jul - First" /> About 400 people worked in the building before the earthquakes.<ref name="7 Aug - attention abroad" /> Following the earthquakes, the [[Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority]] (CERA) was set up to manage the recovery process.<ref>{{cite press release |url= http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new-authority-will-deliver-canterbury |title= New authority will deliver for Canterbury |publisher=New Zealand Government |date=29 March 2011 |accessdate=24 November 2012}}</ref>

==Preparation==
On 30 August 2011, CERA added Radio Network House to the list of buildings to be demolished.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Network House |url= http://cera.govt.nz/demolitions/radio-network-house |publisher=[[Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority]]|accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref> On 17 July 2012, the local Canterbury newspaper ''[[The Press]]'' reported that implosion of Radio Network House had been approved by CERA.<ref name="17 Jul - First" /> The same day, a press conference was held, where representatives of the demolition companies involved and of CERA addressed the media.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Network Building implosion press conference |url= http://cera.govt.nz/news/2012/radio-network-building-implosion-press-conference |publisher=[[Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority]]|accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref> The main contractor for the demolition was Naylor Love, who engaged Ceres New Zealand for the implosion. Ceres in turn partnered with [[Controlled Demolition, Inc.]], an American company based in [[Phoenix, Maryland]], that has a track record of 9,000 implosions and is considered a world leader in the field. The implosion of Radio Network House was a test case, as the technique had not been applied in New Zealand before, and there are still many more tall buildings to be demolished in Christchurch.<ref name="18 Jul - Test Case">{{cite news |last=King |first=Caroline |title=Implosion Could Be Test Case For Christchurch |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/7292551/Implosion-test-case-for-Christchurch |accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=[[The Press]]|date=18 July 2012|location=Christchurch|page=A10}}</ref><ref name="CERA video">{{cite web|title=Radio Network House - Building Implosion - Sunday 5 August 2012|url=http://cera.govt.nz/video/radio-network-house-building-implosion-sunday-5-august-2012|publisher=[[Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority]]|accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref> The implosion was challenging for Controlled Demolition, Inc., as New Zealand buildings are designed to withstand earthquake loading and thus have much more reinforcing in them than the buildings they usually deal with.<ref name="Engineering N-R" />

Before demolition, buildings are stripped of their contents, including internal [[Drywall|plasterboard]] linings. As the fees for dumping demolition waste have risen since the earthquakes, it is more economical for demolition contractors to produce 'clean' demolition material.<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first=David|title=Rubble 'difficult, risky venture'|url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/christchurch-earthquake/5584443/Rubble-difficult-risky-venture |accessdate=27 August 2012|newspaper=stuff.co.nz|date=8 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The Press is shown inside Radio Network House as it is prepared for implosion on August 5.|url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/lightbox/the-press/videos/7338629/Inside-the-Radio-Network-House?KeepThis=true |accessdate=27 August 2012|newspaper=[[The Press]] |month=August |year=2012}}</ref> Holes were drilled into support columns of the building and filled with a total of some {{convert|60|kg}} of explosives, which when set off, would destroy the support structure and cause the collapse of the building.<ref name="CERA video" />  A challenge for the demolition contractor was that explosives available in New Zealand are low-velocity and low-energy.<ref name="Engineering N-R" />

A representative from Ceres stated that the implosion would shorten the demolition process by some six weeks and would save money. Costs were around [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]1m for the implosion, compared to some NZ$1.2m for a conventional demolition, with the owner's building insurance covering the costs.<ref name="17 Jul - First" /> The owner of the building, however, stated that the implosion was not a cheaper option for his company than a conventional demolition, but it "would save others thousands". He likened the consent process to [[Christopher Columbus]] wanting to [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|sail to America]], with everybody telling him that it could not be done.<ref name="6 Aug - bittersweet moment" />

The owner of the Westende building, on the corner of Manchester and Worcester Street and some {{convert|80|m}} away from Radio Network House, threatened to seek a court injunction against the implosion. He raised concerns about potential seismic activity, possible damage to his new building, and noxious contaminants transferred by dust.<ref name="26 Jul - injunction">{{cite news |last=Young |first=Rachel |title=Injunction could stop implosion |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/7350472/Injunction-could-stop-implosion |accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=[[The Press]]|date=26 July 2012|location=Christchurch|page=A3}}</ref> The original Westende building had been destroyed in the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake|first earthquake in 2010]] and was one of the very few new buildings in the centre of Christchurch to have been rebuilt already.<ref>{{cite news|last=Heather|first=Ben|title=Vote of faith in central city area |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/6327640/Vote-of-faith-in-central-city-area |accessdate=8 August 2012|newspaper=[[The Press]]|date=28 January 2012|location=Christchurch}}</ref> The concerns were dismissed by the demolition contractors and the threatened court action did not eventuate.<ref>{{cite news|title=Concerns over implosion unfounded - Manager |url= http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/auckland/news/regch/2015145485-concerns-over-implosion-unfounded---manager |accessdate=8 August 2012|newspaper=[[Newstalk ZB]]|date=26 July 2012}}</ref><!-- and agreement over an acceptable process was reached between the parties without court action.<ref name="3 Aug - boy to push button" /> this statement is not supported by the online version of that article, but I suspect that the printed version was different and did state the fact - Schwede66-->

==Auction==
[[File:The Theatre Royal, Christchurch, NZ.jpg|thumb|Proceeds from the auction have gone to the restoration of the Isaac Theatre Royal (centre) in Christchurch]]
Soon after the announcement was made that the implosion had been approved, it was reported that the demolition contractors considered putting the right to push the button for the implosion up for auction, with the proceeds going to charity. "I've seen them go for $6,000" is how one of the company representatives was quoted, but the issue of liability needed to be worked through.<ref name="18 Jul - Test Case" /> The auction was set up on the internet auction website [[TradeMe]] and went live on Tuesday, 24 July, at 11 am. It was set up with a $1 reserve (meaning that theoretically, the right to push the button could have been sold for just $1).<ref name="25 Jul - TradeMe">{{cite news |last=Turner |first=Anna |title=Auction to push detonation button exceeds $15K |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/7342352/Auction-to-push-detonation-button-exceeds-15K |accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=[[The Press]]|date=25 July 2012|location=Christchurch|page=A2}}</ref> The auction was hugely popular and within one hour, bidding had reached $6,000.<ref name="1 Aug - Bidding stalls" /> Bidding reached $30,000, but some bids were considered illegitimate and TradeMe staff removed them, and in other cases, bidders themselves requested to be removed.<ref name="Illegitimate bids removed">{{cite news|title=Illegitimate bids removed from demolition auction |url= http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/auckland/news/regch/349193640-illegitimate-bids-removed-from-demolition-auction |accessdate=7 August 2012 |newspaper=[[Newstalk ZB]]|date=1 August 2012}}</ref>

The demolition companies involved appealed to the public on the day prior to the implosion to stay away for health and safety reasons, and watch the proceedings on TV or the internet.<ref name="4 Aug - curious">{{cite news |title=Cantabrians Urged To Stay Home During Implosion |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/7408067/Christchurch-told-Stay-away-from-implosion |accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=[[The Press]]|date=4 August 2012|location=Christchurch|page=A7}}</ref> Several television stations had live streams of the event, and ''The Press'' announced that they would post a video on their website shortly after the implosion.

One of CERA's objectives in approving the implosion was to find out how the soil behaved, as Radio Network House was built on one of the worst soils in Christchurch. Seismograph readings showed ground velocity of 12&nbsp;mm/s, which is comparable to a large truck slowly driving across the demolition site. With any residual concerns about the performance of poor soils during building implosions removed, it will be much easier for other building owners to obtain consent from CERA.<ref name="6 Aug - perfect fall" /> Further implosions are likely, with a representative from Controlled Demolition, Inc. describing the Christchurch market as a "target-rich environment".<ref name="6 Aug - perfect fall" />

The implosion attracted global attention, with media in Australia, Canada, Ireland, South Africa and the United States covering the event.<ref name="7 Aug - attention abroad">{{cite news|title=Implosion grabs attention abroad |accessdate=7 August 2012|newspaper=[[The Press]]|date=7 August 2012|location=Christchurch|page=A8}}</ref>
