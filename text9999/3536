'''SM ''U-66''''' was the [[lead ship]] of the [[German Type U 66 submarine|Type U 66]] [[submarine]]s or [[U-boat]]s for the [[German Imperial Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kaiserliche Marine}}) during the [[World War I|First World War]]. The submarine had been [[keel laying|laid down]] in November 1913 as '''''U-7''''', the lead ship of the [[U-7 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-7'' class]] for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kaiserliche und K<U+00F6>nigliche Kriegsmarine ''or'' K.u.K. Kriegsmarine}}) but was sold to Germany, along with the others in her class, in November 1914.

The submarine was ordered as ''U-7'' from [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]] of [[Kiel]] as the first of five boats of the ''U-7'' class for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Austro-Hungarian Navy became convinced that none of the submarines of the class could be delivered to the [[Adriatic]] via [[Gibraltar]]. As a consequence, the entire class, including ''U-7'', was sold to the German Imperial Navy in November 1914. Under German control, the class became known as the U 66 type and the boats were renumbered; ''U-7'' became ''U-66'', and all were redesigned and reconstructed to German specifications. ''U-66'' was [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed in April 1915 and [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed in July. As completed, she displaced {{convert|791|MT|ST}}, surfaced, and {{convert|933|MT|ST}}, submerged. The boat was {{convert|228|ft|m}} long and was armed with five torpedo tubes and a [[deck gun]].

As a part of the [[Baltic Flotilla|Baltic]] and [[IV Flottille|4th Flotillas]], ''U-66'' sank 24 ships with a combined [[gross register tonnage]] of 69,967 in six war patrols. The U-boat also torpedoed and damaged the British cruiser {{HMS|Falmouth|1910|2}} in August 1916. ''U-66'' left [[Emden]] on her seventh patrol on 2 September 1917 for operations in the [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]]. The following day the U-boat reported her position in the [[North Sea]] but neither she nor any of her 40-man crew were ever heard from again. A postwar German study offered no explanation for ''U-66''{{'}}s loss, although British records suggest that she may have struck a [[mine (naval)|mine]] in the [[Dogger Bank]] area.

== Design and construction ==
After the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] had competitively evaluated three foreign submarine designs, it selected the [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]] 506d design, also known as the Type UD, for its new ''U-7'' class  of five submarines.<ref name=Con-340>Gardiner, p. 340.</ref> The Navy ordered five boats on 1 February 1913.<ref name=Con-343>Gardiner, p. 343.</ref>

The ''U-7'' class was seen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy as an improved version of its [[U-3 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-3'' class]], which was also a Germaniawerft design.<ref name=Con-343 /><ref group=Note>The [[U-3 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-3''-class]] submarines, however, were less than half the displacement and nearly {{convert|90|ft|m}} shorter than the ''U-7'' design. See: Gardiner, pp. 342<U+2013>43.</ref> As designed for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, the boats were to [[displace (ship)|displace]] {{convert|695|MT|ST}} on the surface and {{convert|885|MT|ST}} while submerged. The [[hull (submarine)|double-hulled]] boats were to be {{convert|228|ft|m}} long ([[length overall|OA]]) with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|20|ft|8|in|m}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|12|ft|5|in|m}}. The Austrian specifications called for two shafts with twin diesel engines ({{convert|2300|bhp}} total) for surface running at up to {{convert|17|knots|km/h}}, and twin electric motors ({{convert|1240|shp}} total) for a maximum of {{convert|11|knots|km/h}} when submerged.<ref name=Con-343 /> The boats were designed with five {{convert|45|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes; four located in the bow, one in the stern. The boats' armament was to also include a single 66 mm/26 (2.6 in) deck gun.<ref name=Con-343 />

''U-7'' and [[sister boat]] [[SM U-67|''U-8'']] were both [[keel laying|laid down]] on 1 November 1913, the first two boats of the class begun.<ref name=allU66s>Helgason, Gu<U+00F0>mundur.

Retrieved on 9 December 2008.</ref> Their construction was scheduled for completion within 29 to 33 months,<ref name=Con-343 /> but neither ''U-7'' nor any of her [[sister boat]]s were complete when World War I began in August 1914.<ref name=allU66s /> Because the boats were under construction at [[Kiel]] on the [[Baltic Sea]], the Austrians became convinced that it would be impossible to take delivery: the boats would need to be transferred into the Mediterranean past [[Gibraltar]], a British territory.<ref name=Con-343 /><ref group=Note>The [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]]'s Germaniawerft-built [[U-3 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-3'' class]] boats had been towed from [[Kiel]] to [[Pula|Pola]] via [[Gibraltar]] in 1909. See: Sieche, p. 19.</ref> As a result, ''U-7'' and her four sisters were sold to the [[Imperial German Navy]] on 28 November 1914.<ref name=Con-177>Gardiner, p. 177.</ref><ref group=Note>In April 1915, just five months later, the German {{SMS|U-21|Germany|2|sub=y}} successfully entered the Mediterranean through the [[Straits of Gibraltar]], proving that delivery could have been possible after all. See: Gardiner, p. 343.</ref>

''U-7'' was renumbered by the Germans as ''U-66'' when her class was redesignated as the Type U 66.  The Imperial German Navy had the submarines redesigned and reconstructed to German standards, increasing the surface and submerged displacements by {{convert|96|and|48|MT|ST}}, respectively. The torpedo load was increased by a third, from 9 to 12, and the deck gun size was upgraded from the {{convert|66|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} size originally specified to {{convert|88|mm|in|sp=us}}.<ref name=Con-177 />

== Early career ==
''U-66'' was [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed on 22 April 1915.<ref name=Con-177 /> On 23 July, SM ''U-66'' was [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed into the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' under the command of ''[[Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant]]'' Thorwald von Bothmer,<ref name=U-66>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = WWI U-boats: U 66 | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=66 | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | date =  | accessdate = 9 December 2008 | dateformat = dmy }}</ref> a 31-year-old, thirteen-year veteran of the ''Kaiserliche Marine''.<ref name=vonBothmer>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = WWI U-boat commanders: Thorwald von Bothmer | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/men/commanders/32.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | date =  | accessdate = 17 December 2008 | dateformat = dmy }}</ref> ''U-66'' was assigned to the [[Baltic Flotilla]] ({{lang-de|U-boote der Ostseetreittrafte V. Uhalbflotille}}) on 17 October.<ref name=Tar-34>Tarrant, p. 34.</ref>

In late September, the [[British submarine flotilla in the Baltic]] began a submarine offensive against German ships, intending to deny free passage of cargo, especially iron ore, from neutral Sweden to Germany.<ref name=Hal-202>Halpern, p. 202.</ref> In ''A Naval History of World War I'', author Paul G. Halpern reports on part of the German response, which was an experiment involving ''U-66''. The U-boat was towed behind an "innocent-looking vessel" and connected to the host ship by a telephone line in addition to the towline. ''U-66'' was able to cast off at a moment's notice to attack an enemy submarine. Halpern does not report on any encounters by ''U-66'', nor does he provide any insight into the overall effectiveness of the plan.<ref name=Hal-204>Halpern, p. 204.</ref> ''U-66'' was not credited with the sinking of any vessels of any kind during this time.<ref name=U66-ships /> On 15 January 1916, she was transferred from the Baltic Flotilla into the [[IV Flottille|4th Flotilla]] ({{lang-de|IV. Uhalbflotille}}), where she joined her sister boats {{SMS|U-67||2|sub=y}} and {{SMS|U-68||2|sub=y}}.<ref name=Tar-34 /><ref group=Note>Both of ''U-66''{{'}}s remaining sister boats, {{SMS|U-69||2|sub=y}} and {{SMS|U-70||2|sub=y}}, were attached to the [[IV Flottille|4th Flotilla]] by early March, and for just under three weeks (until {{SMS|U-68||2|sub=y}} was sunk), all five of the [[German Type U 66 submarine|Type U 66]] boats were in the same unit. See; Tarrant, p. 30 (for sinking of ''U-68''), and p. 34 (for Flotilla membership).</ref>

== Second German offensive ==
Germany began its [[Battle of the Atlantic (1914<U+2013>1918)|second submarine offensive]] against shipping the month after ''U-66'' joined the 4th Flotilla. As in the first submarine offensive, U-boats were sent independently around [[Scotland]] to patrol the [[Irish Sea]] and the western entrance to the [[English Channel]].<ref>Tarrant, pp. 27<U+2013>28.</ref> The first reported activity of ''U-66'' during this campaign reveals that she sank her first ship on 5 April 1916. On that date she was in the vicinity of [[Fastnet Rock]] and came upon the 3,890-ton British refrigerated [[cargo ship]] ''Zent'' headed from [[Garston, Merseyside|Garston]] to [[Santa Marta]] in [[ballast (ship)|ballast]]. ''U-66'' torpedoed ''Zent'' {{convert|28|nmi|km}} from Fastnet and sank the ship with the loss of 49 crewmen;<ref>Tennent, p. 74.</ref> the [[captain (nautical)|master]] and nine sailors were rescued and landed at [[Cobh|Queenstown]].<ref>{{cite news | title = 48 lost with liner | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 7 April 1916 | page = 1 }}</ref> Over the next two days, ''U-66'' dispatched two French sailing vessels, the 151-ton ''Binicaise'',<ref>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Binicaise | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/801.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | accessdate = 17 December 2008 | dateformat = dmy }}</ref> and the 397-ton fishing [[smack (ship)|smack]] ''Sainte Marie'' west of the [[Isles of Scilly]].<ref>Details, location: {{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Sainte Marie | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/5347.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | accessdate = 17 December 2008 | dateformat = dmy }} Type of ship: {{cite news | title = Nine killed on ship sunk by U-boat; four more vessels destroyed; three British | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 9 April 1916 | page = 1 }}</ref> On 8 April, von Bothmer and ''U-66'' sank the Spanish-flagged ''Santanderino'' {{convert|18|nmi|km}} from [[Ushant]].

''U-66'' continued her attacks on merchant shipping on 9 April with the sinking of three ships, the British steamers ''Eastern City'' and ''Glenalmond'' and the Norwegian ship ''Sjolyst''.<ref name=U66-ships>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Ships hit by U 66 | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/successes/u66.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | accessdate = 9 December 2008 | dateformat = dmy }}</ref> The 4,341-ton ''Eastern City'' was sailing from [[Saint-Nazaire]] to [[Barry Roads]] in ballast when she was shelled by ''U-66'' and sent to the bottom {{convert|18|nmi|km}} from Ushant;<ref name=Tenn-210>Tennent, p. 210.</ref> all of her crew survived and were landed by 11 April.<ref name=WP-1916-04-12 /> ''U-66''{{'}}s next victim was the 2,888-ton ''Glenalmond'' sailing from [[Bilbao]] to [[River Clyde|Clyde]] laden with [[iron ore]].

''U-66'' finished out her busy month the next day by sinking one British and one Italian ship. ''U-66'' sank the British steamer ''Margam Abbey'' {{convert|55|nmi|km}} southwest of [[the Lizard]] while the ship was en route from [[Bordeaux]] to Barry Roads in ballast. ''Margam Abbey'', at 4,471 tons, was the largest ship sunk by ''U-66'' to that time.<ref name=U66-ships /><ref>Tennent, p. 237.</ref> The Italian freighter ''Unione'' was sailing with a load of coal from Clyde for [[Genoa]] when ''U-66'' torpedoed her off [[Land's End]]. The sinking of ''Unione'', with a tonnage of 2,367, raised ''U-66''{{'}}s tally for the month of April to eight ships with a combined tonnage of 22,848,<ref name=U66-ships /> all sunk in a six-day span. Near the end of April 1916, Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]], the new commander-in-chief of the [[High Seas Fleet]] (under which ''U-66''{{'}}s 4th Flotilla operated), called off the merchant shipping offensive and ordered all boats at sea to return, and all boats in port to remain there.<ref>Tarrant, p. 30.</ref>

== Grand Fleet ambushes ==
In mid-May, Scheer completed plans to draw out part of the British [[Grand Fleet]].<ref name=Gib-97>Gibson and Prendergast, p. 97.</ref> The German High Seas Fleet would sortie for a raid on [[Sunderland]],<ref name=Tar-31>Tarrant, p. 31.</ref> luring the British fleet across "'nests' of submarines and mine-fields".<ref name=Gib-97 /> ''U-66'' was one of nine U-boats that put out to sea beginning on 17 May to scout the central [[North Sea]] for signs of the British fleet. Completing five days of scouting, ''U-66'', along with {{SMS|U-63||2|sub=y}}, {{SMS|U-51||2|sub=y}}, {{SMS|U-32|Germany|2|sub=y}}, sister boat {{SMS|U-70||2|sub=y}}, {{SMS|U-24||2|sub=y}}, and {{SMS|U-52||2|sub=y}}, took up position off the [[Firth of Forth]] on 23 May. The other two other boats, {{SMS|U-43|Germany|2|sub=y}} and {{SMS|U-44||2|sub=y}}, were stationed off [[Pentland Firth]], in position to attack the British fleet leaving [[Scapa Flow]]. All the boats were to remain on station until 1 June and await a coded message which would report the sailing of the British fleet.<ref name=Tar-31 /> Unfortunately for the Germans, the British [[Admiralty]] had intelligence reports of the departure of the submarines which, coupled with an absence of attacks on shipping, aroused British suspicions.<ref name=Gib-97 />

A delayed departure of the German fleet for its sortie (which had been redirected to the [[Skagerrak]]) and the failure of five U-boats, including ''U-66'', to receive the coded message warning of the British advance caused Scheer's anticipated ambush to be a "complete and disappointing failure".<ref name=Tar-32>Tarrant, p. 32.</ref> Although she had not received the advance warning of the coded message, ''U-66'' was one of the two ambush U-boats that actually saw parts of the British fleet.<ref name=Tar-32 /> At 09:00 on 31 May, ''U-66'' sent out a [[radio|wireless]] report of eight battleships, light cruisers, and destroyers on a northerly course {{convert|60|nmi|km}} east of [[Kinnaird Head]].<ref name=Gib-99>Gibson and Prendergast, p. 99.</ref><ref group=Note>The other U-boat that reported activity, {{SMS|U-32|Germany|2|sub=y}}, stationed {{convert|155|nmi|km}} off the [[Firth of Forth]], had reported seeing two battleships, two cruisers and several destroyers headed in a southeasterly direction two hours earlier.</ref> ''U-66'' was unable to make any attacks on the ships she reported because of the screening ships.<ref name=Gib-99 /> The failure of the submarine ambush to sink any British capital ships allowed the full Grand Fleet to engage the numerically inferior High Seas Fleet in the [[Battle of Jutland]], which took place 31 May <U+2013> 1 June.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 32<U+2013>33.</ref>

The next mention of ''U-66'' in sources is on 11 August, when she sank ''Inverdruie'', a 613-ton three-masted Norwegian [[bark (ship)|bark]]. ''Inverdruie'' was carrying a load of [[pit prop]]s from [[Sandefjord]] to [[Hartlepool]] when she was sunk some {{convert|160|nmi|km}} east of [[Aberdeen]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Inverdruie | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/3036.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | date =  | accessdate = 17 December 2008 | dateformat = dmy }}</ref><ref><!-- distance -->{{Google maps | url =http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Sinking+of+Inverdruie%4056%C2%B0+46'+N,+2%C2%B0+46'+E&sll=56.766667,2.766667&sspn=0.006927,0.019312&g=Inverdruie&ie=UTF8&ll=57.261223,0.461426&spn=3.50004,9.887695&z=7&iwloc=addr | accessdaymonth = 17 December | accessyear = 2008 }}</ref>

Later in August, the Germans set up another ambush for the British fleet, when they drew up plans for another High Seas Fleet raid on Sunderland (as had been the original intention in May). The German fleet planned to depart late in the day on 18 August and shell military targets the next morning. ''U-66'' was one of 24 U-boats that formed five lines ({{lang-de|Standlinie}}) in the expected paths of any Grand Fleet sorties. ''Standlinie II'', consisting of ''U-63'',  {{SMS|U-49||2|sub=y}},  {{SMS|U-45||2|sub=y}}, ''U-66'', and  {{SMS|U-64||2|sub=y}}, formed a {{convert|35|nmi|km|adj=on}} front {{convert|12|nmi|km}} off [[Flamborough Head]]. The other four ''Standlinie'' formed similar lines to the north and south; all were to be in place by 08:00 on 19 August. Once again, British intelligence had given warning of the impending attack and ambush, causing the Grand Fleet to sortie at 16:00 on 18 August, five hours before the German fleet sailed.<ref name=Tar-33>Tarrant, p. 33.</ref>

At 04:45 on 19 August, ''U-66'' fired a spread of two torpedoes at the British light cruiser {{HMS|Falmouth|1910|2}} from a distance of {{convert|1000|yards|m}}. Both torpedoes scored hits on ''Falmouth''{{'}}s starboard side, flooding the warship forward and aft. The cruiser's mechanical spaces<U+2014>located [[amidships]]<U+2014>remained intact and in working order, so she was steered to the [[Humber]] with an escort of three destroyers and an armed trawler. ''U-66'' tried repeatedly to deal the stricken cruiser a ''[[coup de gr<U+00E2>ce]]'', but narrowly missed with torpedoes on several further attacks. ''U-66'' broke off her pursuit after two hours, having endured multiple attacks from ''Falmouth''{{'}}s screening destroyers. One [[depth charge]] attack blew out all the lights on ''U-66'' and knocked clips off two hatches that caused the boat to flood with a considerable quantity of water before the leaks could be sealed. ''Falmouth'' continued under tow at {{convert|2|knots|km/h}} until she crossed ''Standlinie II'' and was attacked and sunk by ''U-63'' around noon the next day.<ref name=Tar-33 />

Records on ''U-66'' next appear in late 1916, when she is reported as one of the U-boat escorts assisting the German [[merchant raider]] {{SMS|Wolf|auxiliary cruiser|2}} into the North Atlantic.<ref>Hoyt, p. 20.</ref> ''Wolf'', under the command of [[Karl-August Nerger]], began a 15-month raiding voyage on 30 November that took the ship into the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s before a safe return to Germany.<ref name=Hal-372>Halpern, pp. 372<U+2013>73.</ref> ''U-66''{{'}}s specific locations for this duty are not reported, but on 11 December she sank a Norwegian steamer and a Swedish sailing ship. ''U-66'' shelled the 1,090-ton Norwegian steamer ''Bjor'' {{convert|4|nmi|km}} southwest of the Norwegian island of [[Ryvingen]].

== Unrestricted submarine warfare ==
From the early stages of the war the Royal Navy had blockaded Germany, preventing neutral shipping from reaching German ports. By the time of the so-called "turnip winter" of 1916<U+2013>17, the blockade had severely limited imports of food and fuel into Germany.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 44<U+2013>45.</ref> Among the results were an increase in [[infant mortality]] and as many as 700,000 deaths attributed to [[starvation]] or [[hypothermia]] during the war.<ref>Tarrant, p. 45.</ref> With the blockade having such dire consequences, Kaiser [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]] personally approved a [[Battle of the Atlantic (1914<U+2013>1918)#Unrestricted submarine warfare resumed in February 1917|resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare]] to begin on 1 February 1917 to help force the British to make peace.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 45<U+2013>46.</ref> The new rules of engagement specified that no ship was to be left afloat.<ref>Tarrant, p. 46.</ref>

''U-66''{{'}}s first victim under the new rules was encountered on 1 March. The Norwegian steamer ''Gurre'', reported as 1,733 tons, was crossing the North Sea while steaming from [[Narvik]] and [[Fredrikshald, Norway|Fredrikshald]] for Hull with a cargo of iron ore. ''U-66'' torpedoed her at position {{coord|59|30|N|2|0|E|display=inline}}, sending down the Norwegian ship with 20 of her crew.<ref>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Gurre | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/2654.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | date =  | accessdate = 17 December 2008 | dateformat = dmy }}</ref><ref><!--  torpedo -->{{cite web | url = http://www.miramarshipindex.org.nz/ship/show/205050 | title = Crimea | work = Miramar Ship Index | publisher = R.B.Haworth | accessdate = 17 December 2008 | dateformat = dmy }} The 1889 ''Crimea'' had been renamed several times, with her final name of ''Gurre'' attached earlier in 1917.</ref> The same day, ''U-66'' encountered another Norwegian cargo ship, the 1,005-ton ''Livingstone'', headed from [[Skien]] to [[Charente]] with a cargo of [[ammonium nitrate]].

In late March, ''U-66'' sank another two vessels.

Although the monthly total of tonnage sunk by all U-boats had peaked in April, the losses were over 600,000 tons in each of May and June. ''U-66'' did not contribute to the May tally but, with her most successful month since April 1916, added to the June figures.<ref name=U66-ships /> On 5 June, ''U-66'' torpedoed the 3,472-ton Italian steamer ''Amor'' which was on her way to [[Liverpool]] from [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]]; ''Amor'' sank approximately {{convert|200|nmi|km}} from Fastnet Rock.<ref>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Amor | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/260.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | date =  | accessdate = 17 December 2008 | dateformat = dmy }}</ref><ref><!--  torpedoed -->{{cite web | url = http://www.miramarshipindex.org.nz/ship/show/197749 | title = Caprera | work = Miramar Ship Index | publisher = R.B.Haworth | accessdate = 17 December 2008 | dateformat = dmy }} ''Caprera'' had been renamed ''Amor'' in 1911.</ref> The same day, ''Manchester Miller'', a 4,234-ton steamer sailing from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] for Manchester with a load of cotton, was sunk about {{convert|10|nmi|km}} away from ''Amor'' when she was hit by a torpedoes from ''U-66''.

''U-66'' sank her largest ship, the 6,583-ton British steamer ''Bay State'' on 10 June.<ref name=U66-ships /> The Warren Line cargo steamer had departed from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] (the capital of [[Massachusetts]] nicknamed, coincidentally, the "Bay State") with a $2,000,000 war cargo destined for Liverpool.

On 17 June, ''Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant'' von Bothmer was replaced by ''Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant'' Gerhard Muhle as commander of the U-boat.<ref name=U-66 /> ''U-66'' was the first (and ultimately only) U-boat command for the 31-year-old Muhle, who had been a classmate of von Bothmer when both had joined the ''Kaiserliche Marine'' in April 1902.<ref name=vonBothmer /><ref name=Muhle>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = WWI U-boat commanders: Gerhard Muhle | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/men/commanders/214.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | date =  | accessdate = 17 December 2008 | dateformat = dmy }}</ref> On 9 July, ''U-66'' sank her first ship under her new commander, when she sent the Spanish steamer ''Iparraguirre'' to the bottom.

''U-66'' began her seventh and what was to be her final patrol on the morning of 2 September when she departed from [[Emden]] destined for operations in the [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]]. Shortly after noon on 3 September, ''U-66'' reported a position in the North Sea that placed her beyond known British [[minefield]]s, in what was her last known contact. A postwar German study offered no explanation for ''U-66''{{'}}s loss. British records suggest that ''U-66'' may have either struck a [[mine (naval)|mine]] in an older minefield in the [[Dogger Bank]] area, or that a combination of [[destroyer]]s, submarines, and [[anti-submarine net]] tenders sank ''U-66'' sometime between 1 and 11 October. Author Dwight Messimer discounts this latter theory as not being supported by operational details.<ref name=Mess-85>Messimer, p. 85.</ref>
