'''Buckley Air Force Base''' {{Airport codes|BKF|KBKF|BKF}} is a [[United States Air Force]] base in [[Aurora, Colorado]], that was established by the [[U.S. Army]] in 1943. The base was named in honor of the [[World War I]] Army pilot [[United States Army officer rank insignia|1LT]] John Harold Buckley. 

==Overview==
Buckley Air Force Base is an [[Air Force Space Command]] base that serves more than 92,000 active duty, National Guard, Reserve and retired personnel throughout the Front Range community. Buckley AFB defends America through its air operations, space-based missile warning capabilities, space surveillance operations, space communications operations and support functions.<ref name="BAFB">[http://www.buckley.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=4455 Buckley AFB Tenant Units] Official site</ref>

==Units==
The mission of Buckley Air Force Base's host unit, the [[460th Space Wing]] is to deliver global infrared surveillance, tracking missile warning for theater and homeland defense and provide combatant commanders with expeditionary warrior Airmen.  The 460th Space Wing is broken into three groups, each responsible for a distinct part of the Buckley Air Force Base mission.<ref name="BAFB"/>

* 460th Operations Group
: Provides missile warning, missile defense, technical intelligence, satellite command and control, battlespace characterization and robust communications. The group's team of space professionals operates the Defense Support Program satellite, which provides continuous global surveillance, tracking and targeting.<ref name="BAFB"/> 

* 460th Mission Support Group
: Provides trained personnel to support the Air Expeditionary Forces and Homeland Defense. The group is responsible for force protection, quality of life, human resources, contracting, logistics, base infrastructure and environmental stewardship support to the 460th SW, its customers and the base operational missions.<ref name="BAFB"/> 

* 460th Medical Group
: Supports military readiness to the Air Expeditionary Forces and Homeland Defense missions by ensuring base personnel are medically qualified for deployments and providing health care, life skills support, family advocacy, aerospace medicine, public health, bioenvironmental engineering, optometry, ancillary services health and wellness services and dental care.<ref name="BAFB"/>  

The base also hosts the [[Colorado Air National Guard]] [[120th Fighter Squadron]] and its [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16C]] fighters, the 140th Wing also includes the [[Air Mobility Command]]'s 200th Airlift Squadron, operating the [[C-21]] Learjet; the [[Air Force Space Command]]'s 137th Space Warning Squadron; and the [[Pacific Air Forces]]'s 240th Civil Engineering Flight. Air National Guardsmen of the Colorado Air National Guard provide services during national emergencies or wartime and natural disasters. The Colorado Air National Guard is an integral part of the Operation Noble Eagle mission responsible for the 24-hour-a-day defense of the land, sea, and air of the [[United States]].<ref>[http://www.cobuck.ang.af.mil/ Colorado Air National Guard Buckley] - official site</ref>

The ANG's state and federal mission is to provide trained, well-equipped men and women who can augment the active force during national emergencies or war, and provide assistance during natural disasters and civil disturbances. The guard plays a significant role in the Noble Eagle mission responsible for 24-hour defense of the land, sea and air of the continental United States.<ref name="BAFB"/> 

The [[Colorado Army National Guard]] operates the Army Aviation Support Facility at Buckley AFB and is responsible for supplying personnel and equipment for [[CH-47]] Chinook, [[UH-1]] Huey, and [[UH-60]] Blackhawk helicopters.<ref name="BAFB"/> 

==Tenant Units==

==History==
===World War II===
[[File:NAS Denver NAN2-48.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the Naval Air Station Denver in the late 1940s]]
During the early years of [[World War II]] the city of [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] purchased a {{convert|5740|acre|km2|0|sing=on}} parcel of land several miles east of the city and donated it to the Department of the Army. The site was named '''Buckley Field''' after [[First Lieutenant|1st Lt.]] John Harold Buckley, a [[Longmont, Colorado]], native, who was killed while on a combat strafing mission behind enemy lines in [[France]] on September 17, 1918.    

Under the command of the 336th AAF Base Unit (Army Air Forces Technical Training Command), construction on this air base began in early 1942, and that resulted in the construction of over 700 buildings.  On 1 July 1942, the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] Technical Training School there opened. It consisted of bombardier and armorer training for aircrewmen on the [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] and [[B-24 Liberator]] bombers.  During World War II, Buckley Field also trained over 50,000 airmen in initial basic training.

===The Cold War years===
With World War II over, Buckley Field's military role quickly diminished, and in 1946 it became an auxiliary field of the nearby [[Lowry Air Force Base]]. Lowry in turn transferred control of the base to the [[Colorado Air National Guard]] that same year. [[Air National Guard]] ownership lasted less than one year, and then in 1947 the [[Department of the Navy]] took charge of the base and renamed it Naval Air Station Denver. The renamed base was the location of Naval Air Reserve aviation squadrons, as well as for veterans and their families waiting to return to civilian life. Thousands of veterans returned to civilian life here over the next four years, while Naval Air Reservists concurrently conducted operational training. The Navy remained here for 12 years before decommissioning its base on June 30, 1959, and transferring it back to the U.S. Air Force (which had not existed before 1947), which renamed the facility Buckley Air Force Base.  However, the Naval Reserve remained at Buckley as tenant activity known as Naval Air Reserve Center Denver, the predecessor of the present day Navy Operational Support Center Denver. 

Buckley Field once again became the Buckley Air National Guard Base on April 18, 1960.  At the same time, it became the first stand-alone [[Air National Guard]] base in the country.  The [[Colorado Air National Guard]] remained in control of Buckley Field for the next 40 years, operating it as a fighter base.

During the [[Cold War]] era, the Colorado Air National Guard mobilized the Buckley-based 120th Tactical Fighter Squadron for such historical events as the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], the [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|USS ''Pueblo'' crisis]], and the [[Vietnam War]].

During the 1970s and 1980s, the growth of Aurora, Denver's eastern neighbor, edged toward Buckley Field, and the land of the air base was eventually annexed by that city, although the installation remains U.S. Government property under Federal vice municipal jurisidction. 

Other tenant units at Buckley Field during the Cold War era included the:
* ''154th Tactical Air Support Group'', an [[Air National Guard]] (ANG) unit trained to provide [[close air support]] for [[United States Army]] ground operations.  The 154th Group had its own truck-mounted tactical [[radar]] units and radar-control vans, but no aircraft were assigned to the [[Group (air force unit)|Group]].  (circa 1970 through 1989)

===Modern era===
Although the Cold War ended in the early 1990s, the 120th Tactical Fighter Wing did not see any decrease in its responsibilities.  This Fighter Wing deployed from Buckley Field numerous times during the decade of the 1990s to take part in various military operations such as [[Operation Desert Storm]], [[Operation Northern Watch]], and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].

In October 2000, the Buckley Air National Guard base was transferred to U.S. Air Force control, and it was renamed the Buckley Air Force Base.

Since the return of Buckley Field to the Air Force in 2000, the air base has seen an unprecedented amount of new construction and modernization. New enlisted airmen's dormitories, the commissary, the base exchange, and the fitness center have all been completed, augmented by the completion of family housing units - the first ones ever constructed at Buckley Field.
