'''SMS ''Scharnhorst''''' ("His Majesty's Ship ''Scharnhorst''"){{efn|name=SMS|}} was an [[armored cruiser]] of the [[Kaiserliche Marine|Imperial German Navy]], built at the [[Blohm & Voss]] shipyard in [[Hamburg]], Germany. She was the [[lead ship]] of [[Scharnhorst class cruiser|her class]], which also included her sister {{SMS|Gneisenau}}. ''Scharnhorst'' and her sister were enlarged versions of the preceding {{sclass|Roon|cruiser|4}}; they were equipped with a greater number of main guns and a higher top speed. The ship was named after the [[Prussia]]n reformer General [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst]] and commissioned into service on 24 October 1907.

''Scharnhorst'' served briefly with the [[High Seas Fleet]] in Germany in 1908, though most of this time was spent conducting [[sea trials]]. She was assigned to the [[German East Asia Squadron]] based in [[Tsingtao]], China in 1909. After arriving, she replaced the cruiser {{SMS|F<U+00FC>rst Bismarck|1897|2}} as the squadron [[flagship]], a position she would hold for the rest of her career. Over the next five years, she went on several tours of various Asian ports to [[:wikt:show the flag|show the flag]] for Germany. She frequently carried the squadron commanders to meet with Asian heads of state and was present in Japan for the coronation of the [[Taish<U+014D> Emperor]] in 1912.

After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'', accompanied by three [[light cruiser]]s and several colliers, sailed across the Pacific Ocean<U+2014>in the process evading the various Allied naval forces sent to intercept them<U+2014>before arriving off the southern coast of South America. On 1 November 1914, ''Scharnhorst'' and the rest of the East Asia Squadron encountered and overpowered a British squadron at the [[Battle of Coronel]]. The stinging defeat prompted the British [[Admiralty]] to dispatch two [[battlecruiser]]s to hunt down and destroy von Spee's flotilla, which they accomplished at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]] on 8 December 1914.

{{main|Scharnhorst-class cruiser}}

''Scharnhorst'' was {{convert|144.6|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|21.6|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|8.37|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. The ship displaced {{convert|11616|MT|link=on}} standard and {{convert|12985|t|LT|abbr=on}} at [[deep load]]. She was powered by three [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple-expansion steam engines]]s with eighteen coal-fired [[water-tube boiler]]s. Her engines were rated at {{convert|26000|ihp|lk=in}}, for a top speed of {{convert|22.5|kn|lk=in}}. ''Scharnhorst''{{'}}s crew consisted of 52&nbsp;officers and 788&nbsp;enlisted men; of these, 14&nbsp;officers and 62&nbsp;enlisted men were assigned to the squadron commander's staff and were additional to the standard complement.{{sfn|Gr<U+00F6>ner|p=52}}

''Scharnhorst''{{'}}s primary armament consisted of eight [[21 cm SK L/40 gun|21&nbsp;cm (8.2&nbsp;inch) SK L/40 guns]],{{efn|name=gun nomenclature}} four in twin [[gun turret]]s, one fore and one aft of the main [[superstructure]], and the remaining four were mounted in single [[Gun turret#Wing turrets|wing turrets]]. Secondary armament included six [[15 cm SK L/40 naval gun|15&nbsp;cm (5.9&nbsp;inch) SK L/40 guns]] in [[casemate]]s and eighteen 8.8&nbsp;cm (3.45&nbsp;inch) guns mounted in casemates. She was also equipped with four {{convert|45|cm|in|abbr=on}} submerged torpedo tubes. One was mounted in the bow, one on each [[broadside]], and the fourth was placed in the stern. The ship's [[armored belt]] was 15&nbsp;cm thick and the gun turrets had {{convert|18|cm|abbr=on}} thick faces. Her deck was {{convert|3.5|to|6|cm|abbr=on}} thick, with the heavier armor protecting the ship's [[engine room|engine]] and [[fire room|boiler rooms]] and ammunition [[Magazine (artillery)|magazines]].{{sfn|Gr<U+00F6>ner|p=52}}{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=142}}

== Service history ==

Named for ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' (Lieutenant General) [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst]], a Prussian military reformer during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], ''Scharnhorst'' was laid down at the [[Blohm & Voss]] shipyard in Hamburg, Germany on 22 March 1905,{{sfn|Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz|p=105}} under construction number 175.{{sfn|Gr<U+00F6>ner|p=52}} She was launched on 23 March 1906, and ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' (Field Marshal) [[Gottlieb Graf von Haeseler]] gave the speech and christened the ship at her launching ceremony.{{sfn|Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz|p=106}} The new armored cruiser was commissioned into the fleet a year and a half later on 24 October 1907. She thereafter began [[sea trials]] and while conducting speed tests, she exceeded her design speed by one knot, reaching {{convert|23.5|kn}}.{{sfn|Gr<U+00F6>ner|p=52}}{{sfn|Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz|p=106}}

From 6 to 11 November, her trials were interrupted by a voyage to [[Vlissingen]] in the Netherlands and [[Portsmouth]] in Britain in company with [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]]'s yacht [[SMY Hohenzollern|''Hohenzollern'']] and the [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|K<U+00F6>nigsberg|1905|2}}. On 14 January 1908, ''Scharnhorst'' ran aground off the [[B<U+00FC>lk lighthouse]] and suffered serious underwater damage. Repairs were effected at Blohm & Voss and lasted until 22 February. Shortly thereafter, the cruiser resumed her trials, which continued until the end of April. On 1 May, she replaced {{SMS|Yorck||2}} as the [[flagship]] of the reconnaissance forces of the [[High Seas Fleet]], under the command of ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' (Rear Admiral) [[August von Heeringen]]. Over the course of the rest of the year, she participated in the normal peacetime routine of training exercises and fleet maneuvers.{{sfn|Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz|p=106}}

===East Asia Squadron===
[[File:Contemporary map of Tsingtau and the Shandong Peninsula.png|thumb|German 1912 map of the [[Shandong Peninsula]] showing the [[Kiautschou Bay concession]]|alt=The Kiautschou Bay concession was located in the natural harbor at Tsingtao on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula]]
On 11 March 1909, ''Scharnhorst'' was assigned to the [[German East Asia Squadron|''Ostasiengeschwader'']] (East Asia Squadron); ''Yorck'' replaced her as the reconnaissance squadron flagship. After completing preparations for the voyage, ''Scharnhorst'' departed Kiel on 1 April; aboard was ''Konteradmiral'' [[Friedrich von Ingenohl]], who was to take command of the East Asia Squadron upon his arrival.{{sfn|Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz|pp=106&ndash;107}} On 29 April, ''Scharnhorst'' rendezvoused with {{SMS|F<U+00FC>rst Bismarck|1897|2}}, the flagship of the East Asia Squadron, in [[Colombo]]. There, ''Scharnhorst'' took over the role of squadron flagship. At the time, the squadron also included the light cruisers {{SMS|Leipzig||2}} and {{SMS|Arcona||2}} and several [[gunboat]]s and [[torpedo boat]]s. In July and August, ''Scharnhorst'' went on a cruise in the [[Yellow Sea]] and in August surveyed ports in the area. She spent December and early January 1910 in [[Hong Kong]] for the Christmas and New Year's festivities in company with ''Leipzig'' and the gunboat {{SMS|Luchs||2}}.{{sfn|Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz|p=107}}

In January, ''Scharnhorst'', ''Leipzig'', and ''Luchs'' went on a tour of East Asian ports, including [[Bangkok]], [[Manila]], and stops in [[Sumatra]] and [[North Borneo]]. By 22 March, ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Leipzig'' had returned to the German port at [[Tsingtao]]. In the meantime, ''Arcona'' had left the East Asia Squadron in February; her replacement, {{SMS|N<U+00FC>rnberg|1906|2}}, arrived on 9 April. Ingenohl, by now promoted to ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' (Vice Admiral), departed on 6 June and was replaced by ''Konteradmiral'' [[Erich G<U+00FC>hler]]. The new squadron commander took ''Scharnhorst'' and ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' on a tour of Germany's Pacific colonies, starting on 20 June. Stops included the [[Mariana Islands]], [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]], and [[Apia]] in [[German Samoa]]. In the last port, the cruisers met the [[unprotected cruiser]]s {{SMS|Cormoran|1892|2}} and {{SMS|Condor||2}}, the station ships for the South Seas Station. While there, the new light cruiser {{SMS|Emden|1908|2}} arrived on 22 July to further strengthen the East Asia Squadron.{{sfn|Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz|p=107}}

[[File:SMS Scharnhorst (1).jpg|thumb|left|Pre-war photo of ''Scharnhorst''|alt=A large white warship at anchor in a calm sea, with a small boat alongside]]

In 1910, ''Scharnhorst'' won the Kaiser's ''Schie<U+00DF>preis'' (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery in the East Asia Squadron. On 25 November, ''Scharnhorst'' and the rest of the squadron went on a trip to Hong Kong and [[Nanjing]]; while in Hong Kong, an outbreak of [[typhus]] struck. Among those who were infected was G<U+00FC>hler, who succumbed to the disease on 21 January 1911. In the meantime, unrest had broken out in [[Pohnpei|Ponape]], which required the presence of ''Emden'' and ''N<U+00FC>rnberg''. ''Scharnhorst'' instead went on a tour of Southeast Asian ports, including [[Saigon]], [[Singapore]], and [[Jakarta|Batavia]]. She then returned to Tsingtao by way of Hong Kong and [[Amoy]], arriving on 1 March. There, ''Konteradmiral'' [[G<U+00FC>nther von Krosigk]] was waiting to take command of the squadron. Two weeks later, the squadron was reinforced by the arrival of ''Scharnhorst''{{'}}s [[sister ship]] {{SMS|Gneisenau||2}} on 14 March.{{sfn|Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz|p=107}} From 30 March to 12 May, ''Scharnhorst'' went on a cruise in Japanese waters with Krosigk aboard. She thereafter steamed to the northern area of the German protectorate in early July; at the time tensions were high in Europe due to the [[Agadir Crisis]]. Krosigk attempted to keep the situation calm in East Asia and he took his flagship on a tour of harbors in the Yellow Sea. By 15 September, the cruiser was back in Tsingtao.{{sfn|Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz|p=108}}

After arriving in Tsingtao, ''Scharnhorst'' went into dock for her annual repair; Krosigk accordingly shifted his flag to ''Gneisenau'' temporarily. On 10 October, the [[Xinhai Revolution]] against the [[Qing Dynasty]] broke out, which caused a great deal of tension amongst the Europeans, who recalled the attacks on foreigners during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] of 1900&ndash;01. The rest of the East Asia Squadron was placed on alert to protect German interests and additional troops were sent to protect the German consulate. But the feared attacks on Europeans did not materialize and so the East Asia Squadron was not needed. By late November, ''Scharnhorst'' was back in service and Krosigk returned to the ship. She cruised to Shanghai by way of [[Tientsin]] and [[Yantai]], arriving on 12 December. From 14 to 24 January 1912, ''Scharnhorst'' toured the ports of the central China coast and returned to Tsingtao on 9 March, where the rest of the squadron had assembled.{{sfn|Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz|pp=108&ndash;109}} On 13 April, the ships went on a month-long cruise to Japanese waters, returning to Tsingtao on 13 May. From 17 July to 4 September, ''Scharnhorst'' went on another tour of Japanese ports and during this period she also visited [[Vladivostok]] in Russia and several ports in the Yellow Sea.{{sfn|Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz|p=109}}

[[File:Vonspee1.JPG|thumb|left|upright|''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' [[Maximilian von Spee]], who would command ''Scharnhorst'' during World War I|alt=A older man in a double-breasted naval uniform]]
On 30 July, the [[Meiji Emperor]] died; ''Scharnhorst'' escorted ''Leipzig'', which carried [[Prince Heinrich]], Wilhelm II's brother, to the Meiji Emperor's funeral and the coronation ceremony for the [[Taish<U+014D> Emperor]]. The ships remained in Japan from 5 to 26 September. After returning to Tsingtao, Prince Heinrich conducted an inspection of the entire East Asia Squadron. On 4 December, Krosigk handed over command of the squadron to ''Konteradmiral'' [[Maximilian von Spee]]. On 27 December, Spee took ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' on a tour of the southwest Pacific, including stops in Amoy, Singapore, and Batavia. The two cruisers reached Tsingtao on 2 March 1913. From 1 April to 7 May, ''Scharnhorst'' took Spee to Japan to meet the Taish<U+014D> Emperor.{{sfn|Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz|p=109}} Starting on 22 June, Spee began a tour of Germany's Pacific colonies aboard his flagship. The ship stopped in the Marianas, the [[Admiralty Islands]], the [[Hermit Islands]], [[Rabaul]] in [[Neupommern]], and [[Friedrich Wilhelmshafen]] in [[German New Guinea]].{{sfn|Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz|pp=109&ndash;110}}

While in Rabaul on 21 July, Spee received word of further unrest in China, which prompted his return to the [[Wusong]] [[roadstead]] outside Shanghai by 30 July. After the situation calmed, Spee was able to take his ships on a short cruise to Japan, which began on 11 November. ''Scharnhorst'' and the rest of the squadron returned to Shanghai on 29 November, before she departed for another trip to Southwest Asia. Spee met with [[Chulalongkorn]], the [[Monarchy of Thailand|King of Siam]], and also visited Sumatra, North Borneo, and Manila. ''Scharnhorst'' returned to Tsingtao on 19 March 1914. In early May, Spee, by now promoted to ''Vizeadmiral'', took ''Scharnhorst'' and the torpedo boat {{SMS|S90}} on a visit to Port Arthur and then to Tianjin; Spee continued on to Beijing, where he met with [[Yuan Shikai]], the first [[President of the Republic of China]]. He came back aboard ''Scharnhorst'' on 11 May and the ship returned to Tsingtao. Spee thereafter began preparations for a cruise to German New Guinea; ''Scharnhorst'' departed on 20 June, leaving only ''Emden'' behind in Tsingtao.{{sfn|Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz|p=110}}

''Gneisenau'' rendezvoused with ''Scharnhorst'' in [[Nagasaki]], Japan, where they received a full supply of coal. They then sailed south, arriving in Truk in early July where they would restock their coal supplies. While en route, they received news of the assassination of Archduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]], heir to the throne of [[Austria-Hungary]].{{sfn|Hough|pp=11<U+2013>12}} On 17 July, the East Asia Squadron arrived in Ponape in the [[Caroline Islands]]. Spee now had access to the German radio network and he learned of the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Serbia and the Russian mobilization against Austria-Hungary and possibly Germany. On 31 July, word came that the German ultimatum that Russia demobilize its armies was set to expire. Spee ordered his ships be stripped for war.{{efn|name=stripped for war}} On 2 August, Wilhelm II ordered German mobilization against Russia and its ally, France.{{sfn|Hough|pp=17<U+2013>18}}

=== World War I ===
[[File:East Asia Squadron in Kiaochow Bay.png|thumb|German East Asia Squadron in Tsingtao; ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' are at center|alt=A group of ships of varying sizes at anchor in a harbor]]
When the [[First World War]] broke out, the East Asia Squadron consisted of ''Scharnhorst'', ''Gneisenau'', ''Emden'', ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'', and ''Leipzig''.{{sfn|Halpern|p=66}} At the time, ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' was returning from the west coast of the United States, where ''Leipzig'' had just replaced her, and ''Emden'' was still in Tsingtao.{{sfn|Staff|p=29}} On 6 August 1914, ''Scharnhorst'', ''Gneisenau'', the supply ship ''Titania'', and the Japanese collier ''Fukoku Maru'' were still in Ponape.{{sfn|Halpern|p=71}} Von Spee had issued orders to recall the light cruisers, which had been dispersed on cruises around the Pacific.{{sfn|Hough|pp=1<U+2013>2}} ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' joined von Spee that day,{{sfn|Halpern|p=71}} after which Spee moved his ships to [[Pagan Island]] in the [[northern Marianas Islands]], a German possession in the central Pacific.{{sfn|Staff|p=29}}

All available [[Collier (ship type)|colliers]], supply ships, and passenger liners were ordered to meet the East Asia Squadron in Pagan{{sfn|Hough|pp=3<U+2013>4}} and ''Emden'' joined the squadron there on 12 August.{{sfn|Staff|p=29}} The [[auxiliary cruiser]] {{SS|Prinz Eitel Friedrich|1904|2}} joined Spee's ships there as well.{{sfn|Hough|p=5}} The four cruisers, accompanied by ''Prinz Eitel Friedrich'' and several colliers, then departed the central Pacific, bound for Chile. On 13 August, Commodore [[Karl von M<U+00FC>ller]], captain of the ''Emden'', persuaded Spee to detach his ship as a commerce raider. On 14 August, the East Asia Squadron departed Pagan for [[Enewetak Atoll]] in the [[Marshall Islands]], with ''Scharnhorst'' in the lead.{{sfn|Hough|p=23}} The ships again coaled after their arrival on 20 August.{{sfn|Hough|p=33}}

[[File:Escadre allemande d'Extr<U+00EA>me-Orient 1914 1915-de.svg|300px|thumb|left|Map showing the route of the East Asia Squadron]]
 
To keep the German high command informed, on 8 September von Spee detached ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' to Honolulu to send word through neutral countries. ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' returned with news of the [[Fall_of_German_Samoa|Allied capture of German Samoa]] on 29 August.  ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' sailed to Apia to investigate the situation.{{sfn|Strachan|p=471}} Spee had hoped to catch a British or Australian warship by surprise, but upon his arrival on 14 September, he found no warships in the harbor.{{sfn|Staff|pp=29&ndash;30}} On 22 September, ''Scharnhorst'' and the rest of the East Asia Squadron arrived at the French colony of [[Papeete]]. The Germans attacked the colony, and in the ensuing [[Battle of Papeete]], they sank the French gunboat [[French gunboat Z<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>e|''Z<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>e'']]. The ships came under fire from French shore batteries but were undamaged.{{sfn|Staff|p=30}} Fear of mines in the harbor prevented von Spee from seizing the coal in the harbor.{{sfn|Halpern|p=89}}

By 12 October, ''Scharnhorst'' and the rest of the squadron had reached [[Easter Island]]. There they were joined by ''Dresden'' and ''Leipzig'', which had sailed from American waters, on 12 and 14 October, respectively. ''Leipzig'' also brought three more colliers with her.{{sfn|Staff|p=30}} After a week in the area, the ships departed for Chile.{{sfn|Hawkins|p=34}} On the evening of 26 October, ''Scharnhorst'' and the rest of the squadron steamed out of [[Alejandro Selkirk Island|Mas a Fuera]], Chile and headed eastward, arriving in [[Valparaiso]] on 30 October. On 1 November, Spee learned from ''Prinz Eitel Friedrich'' that the British light cruiser {{HMS|Glasgow|1909|6}} had been anchored in [[Coronel, Chile|Coronel]] the previous day, so he turned towards the port to try to catch her alone.{{sfn|Halpern|p=92}}{{sfn|Staff|pp=30&ndash;31}}

==== Battle of Coronel ====
[[Image:Battle of Coronel map.svg|thumb|right|300px|Ship movements during the Battle of Coronel. British ships are shown in red; German ships are shown in blue.|alt=The British and German fleets converged from the south and north, respectively. Two British ships split off to escape.]]
{{main|Battle of Coronel}}

The British had scant resources to oppose the German squadron off the coast of South America. Rear Admiral [[Christopher Cradock]] commanded the armored cruisers {{HMS|Good Hope|1901|6}} and {{HMS|Monmouth|1901|2}}, ''Glasgow'', and the converted [[armed merchant cruiser]] {{HMS|Otranto||2}}. The flotilla was reinforced by the elderly [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] {{HMS|Canopus|1897|2}} and the armored cruiser {{HMS|Defence|1907|2}}. The latter, however, did not arrive until after the Battle of Coronel.{{sfn|Herwig|p=156}} ''Canopus'' was left behind by Cradock, who likely felt her slow speed would prevent him from bringing the German ships to battle.{{sfn|Halpern|p=92}}

The East Asia Squadron arrived off Coronel on the afternoon of 1 November; to Spee's surprise, he encountered ''Good Hope'', ''Monmouth'', and ''Otranto'' in addition to ''Glasgow''. ''Canopus'' was still some {{convert|300|mi}} behind, with the British colliers.{{sfn|Halpern|pp=92<U+2013>93}} At 16:17, ''Glasgow'' spotted the German ships. Cradock formed a line of battle with ''Good Hope'' in the lead, followed by ''Monmouth'', ''Glasgow'', and ''Otranto'' in the rear. Spee decided to hold off engaging until the sun had set more, at which point the British ships would be silhouetted by the sun, while his own ships would be obscured against the coast behind them. Cradock realized the uselessness of ''Otranto'' in the line of battle and detached her.{{sfn|Halpern|p=93}}{{sfn|Staff|p=32}}

By 18:07, the distance between the two squadrons had fallen to {{convert|13500|m|abbr=on}} and Spee ordered his ships to open fire thirty minutes later; each ship engaged their opposite in the British line.{{sfn|Staff|p=33}} ''Scharnhorst'' engaged ''Good Hope'' and hit her on the third salvo, striking between her forward gun turret and her [[conning tower]] and starting a major fire. Once the German gunners found the range, they began firing rapidly, with one salvo of [[high-explosive]] shells every fifteen seconds.{{sfn|Staff|pp=33&ndash;34}} ''[[Oberleutnant zur See]]'' (Lieutenant at Sea) Knoop, the spotting officer aboard ''Scharnhorst'', reported that "Continual hits could be observed&nbsp;... in the midships ''Good Hope'' was hit repeatedly, with much fire resulting&nbsp;... the interior of this part of the ship was on fire, which could be seen through the portholes, shining brightly."{{sfn|Staff|p=34}}

In the meantime, ''Glasgow'' began to shoot at both ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'', since she could no longer engage the German light cruisers. One of her {{convert|4|in|adj=on}} shells struck ''Scharnhorst'' in the [[forecastle]] but failed to explode. By 18:50, ''Monmouth'' had been badly damaged by ''Gneisenau'' and she fell out of line; ''Gneisenau'' therefore joined ''Scharnhorst'' in battling ''Good Hope''.{{sfn|Staff|p=35}} At the same time, ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' closed to point-blank range of ''Monmouth'' and poured shells into her.{{sfn|Herwig|p=157}} At 19:23, ''Good Hope''{{'}}s guns fell silent following two large explosions; the German gunners ceased fire shortly thereafter. ''Good Hope'' disappeared into the darkness. Spee ordered his light cruisers to close with his battered opponents and finish them off with torpedoes, while he took ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' further south to get out of the way.{{sfn|Staff|p=36}}

[[Image:Ostasiengeschwader Graf Spee in Chile.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The German squadron leaving [[Valparaiso]] on 3 November after the battle, ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' in the lead and ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' following.

''Glasgow'' was forced to abandon ''Monmouth'' after 19:20 when the German light cruisers approached, before fleeing south and meeting with ''Canopus''. A squall prevented the Germans from discovering ''Monmouth'', but she eventually capsized and sank at 20:18.{{sfn|Staff|p=36}}{{sfn|Strachan|p=36}} More than 1,600&nbsp;men were killed in the sinking of the two armored cruisers, including Cradock. German losses were negligible. However, the German ships had expended over 40% of their ammunition supply.{{sfn|Halpern|p=93}} ''Scharnhorst'' was hit twice during the engagement, but both shells failed to explode.{{sfn|Strachan|p=36}} The second hit passed through her third funnel and did not explode; she was struck by shell splinters that damaged her wireless antenna array. She suffered no casualties and the only German injuries were two slightly wounded men aboard ''Gneisenau''.{{sfn|Staff|p=39}}

After the battle, Spee took his ships north to Valparaiso. Since Chile was neutral, only three ships could enter the port at a time; Spee took ''Scharnhorst'', ''Gneisenau'', and ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' in first on the morning of 3 November, leaving ''Dresden'' and ''Leipzig'' with the colliers at Mas a Fuera. There, Spee's ships could take on coal while he conferred with the ''[[Admiralstab]]'' (Admiralty Staff) in Germany to determine the strength of remaining British forces in the region. The ships remained in the port for only 24 hours, in accordance with the neutrality restrictions, and arrived at Mas a Fuera on 6 November, where they took on more coal from captured British and French steamers. On 10 November, ''Dresden'' and ''Leipzig'' were detached for a stop in Valparaiso, and five days later, Spee took the rest of the squadron south to [[St. Quentin Bay]] in the [[Gulf of Penas]]. On 18 November, ''Dresden'' and ''Leipzig'' met Spee while en route and the squadron reached St. Quentin Bay three days later. There, they took on more coal, since the voyage around [[Cape Horn]] would be a long one and it was unclear when they would have another opportunity to coal.{{sfn|Staff|pp=58&ndash;59}}

{{main|Battle of the Falkland Islands}}

Once word of the defeat reached London, the Royal Navy set to organizing a force to hunt down and destroy the East Asia Squadron. To this end, the powerful new [[battlecruiser]]s {{HMS|Invincible|1907|2}} and {{HMS|Inflexible|1907|2}} were detached from the [[Grand Fleet]] and placed under the command of Vice Admiral [[Doveton Sturdee]].{{sfn|Strachan|p=41}} The two ships left [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] on 10 November and while en route to the [[Falkland Islands]], they were joined by the armored cruisers {{HMS|Carnarvon|1903|2}}, {{HMS|Kent|1901|2}}, and {{HMS|Cornwall|1902|2}}, the light cruisers {{HMS|Bristol|1910|2}} and ''Glasgow'', and ''Otranto''. The force of eight ships reached the Falklands by 7 December, where they immediately coaled.{{sfn|Strachan|p=47}}

In the meantime, Spee's ships departed St. Quentin Bay on 26 November and rounded Cape Horn on 2 December. They captured the Canadian [[barque]] ''Drummuir'', which had a cargo of {{convert|2500|MT|abbr=on|sp=us}} of good-quality [[Cardiff]] coal. ''Leipzig'' took the ship under tow and the following day the ships stopped off [[Picton Island]]. The crews transferred the coal from ''Drummuir'' to the squadron's colliers. On the morning of 6 December, Spee held a conference with the ship commanders aboard ''Scharnhorst'' to determine their next course of action. The Germans had received numerous fragmentary and contradictory reports of British reinforcements in the region; Spee and two other captains favored an attack on the Falkands, while three other commanders argued that it would be better to bypass the islands and attack British shipping off Argentina. Spee's opinion carried the day and the squadron departed for the Falklands at 12:00 on 6 December.{{sfn|Staff|pp=61&ndash;62}}

''Gneisenau'' and ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' were delegated for the attack; they approached the Falklands the following morning, with the intention of destroying the wireless transmitter there. Observers aboard ''Gneisenau'' spotted smoke rising from [[Port Stanley]], but assumed it was the British burning their coal stocks to prevent the Germans from seizing them.{{sfn|Staff|p=62}} As they closed on the harbor, {{convert|30.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} shells from ''Canopus'', which had been beached as a guard ship, began to fall around the German ships, which prompted Spee to break off the attack.{{sfn|Strachan|p=47}} The Germans took a south-easterly course at {{convert|22|kn|abbr=on}} after having reformed by 10:45. ''Scharnhorst'' was the center ship, with ''Gneisenau'' and ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' ahead and ''Dresden'' and ''Leipzig'' astern.{{sfn|Bennett|p=115}}{{sfn|Staff|p=63}} The fast battlecruisers quickly got up steam and sailed out of the harbor to pursue the slower East Asia Squadron.{{sfn|Strachan|p=47}}

By 13:20, the British ships had caught up with ''Scharnhorst'' and the other cruisers and began firing at a range of {{convert|14|km|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Herwig|p=158}} Spee realized his armored cruisers could not escape the much faster battlecruisers and ordered the three light cruisers to attempt to break away while he turned about and allowed the British battlecruisers to engage the outgunned ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau''. Meanwhile, Sturdee detached his cruisers to pursue the German light cruisers.{{sfn|Bennett|p=117}} ''Invincible'' opened fire at ''Scharnhorst'' while ''Inflexible'' attacked ''Gneisenau'' and Spee ordered his two armored cruisers to similarly engage their opposites. Spee had taken the [[Windward and leeward|lee]] position; the wind kept his ships swept of smoke, which improved visibility for his gunners. This forced Sturdee into the windward position and its corresponding worse visibility. ''Scharnhorst'' straddled ''Invincible'' with her third salvo and quickly scored two hits on the British battlecruiser. The German flagship was herself not hit during this phase of the battle.{{sfn|Staff|p=66}}

Sturdee attempted to widen the distance by turning two points to the north to prevent Spee from closing to within the range of his numerous secondary guns. Spee counteracted this maneuver by turning rapidly to the south, which forced Sturdee to turn south as well to keep within range. This allowed ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' to turn back north and get close enough to engage with their secondary 15&nbsp;cm guns. Their shooting was so accurate that it forced the British to haul away a second time.{{sfn|Bennett|p=118}} After resuming the battle, the British gunfire became more accurate;{{sfn|Staff|p=67}} ''Scharnhorst'' was hit several times and fires broke out. The pace of her gunfire started to slacken, though she continued to score hits on ''Invincible''. Sturdee then turned to port in an attempt to take the leeward position, but Spee countered the turn to retain his favorable position; the maneuvering did, however, reverse the order of the ships, so ''Scharnhorst'' now engaged ''Inflexible''.{{sfn|Staff|p=68}}

[[File:Cfbattlepainting.jpg|thumb|left|''Scharnhorst'' rolls over and sinks while ''Gneisenau'' continues to fight|alt=A large warship on its side in the water, exposing the red bottom; another large warship is seen in the distance afire and shooting its guns]]

By this stage of the battle, ''Scharnhorst'' had a slight list to port and was about a meter lower in the water. Her third funnel had been shot away. ''Gneisenau'' was briefly obscured by smoke, which led both battlecruisers to target ''Scharnhorst''. By 16:00, Spee ordered ''Gneisenau'' to attempt to escape while he reversed course and attempted to launch torpedoes at his pursuers. The port list had increased significantly by this point and she was well down by the bow, with only {{convert|2|m|sp=us}} of [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]]. At 16:17, the ship finally capsized to port and sank; the British made no attempt to rescue the crew.{{sfn|Staff|p=69}} All 860 officers and men on board, including Spee, went down with the ship.{{sfn|Gr<U+00F6>ner|p=52}} ''Gneisenau'', ''Leipzig'', and ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' were also sunk. Only ''Dresden'' managed to escape, but she was eventually tracked to the [[Juan Fern<U+00E1>ndez Islands|Juan Fernandez Islands]] and sunk. The complete destruction of the squadron killed about 2,200 German sailors and officers, including two of Spee's sons.{{sfn|Herwig|p=158}}

In mid-1915, a coastal steamer found the body of a German sailor off the coast of Brazil. The sailor had a watertight cartridge case from a 21&nbsp;cm shell attached; inside was one of the ''[[Reichskriegsflagge]]n'' (Imperial war flags) flown aboard ''Scharnhorst''. The sailor was buried in Brasil and the flag was eventually returned to Germany, where it was placed on display at the [[Museum f<U+00FC>r Meereskunde]] (Marine Science) in Berlin, though it was lost during [[World War II]].{{sfn|Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz|p=112}} In the mid-1930s, the new German navy, the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'', built a battleship named for ''Scharnhorst''. At the launching of the new {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} in October 1936, the widow of the earlier ship's captain was present.{{sfn|Williamson|p=8}}
