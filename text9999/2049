The '''Stadium District''' is a neighborhood of the [[North Tacoma, Washington|north end]] of [[Tacoma, Washington]], USA. It is named after [[Stadium High School]], a historic landmark.

The district is located between the affluent [[North Slope, Tacoma, Washington|North Slope]] residential neighborhood and the [[Hilltop Neighborhood, Tacoma, Washington|Hilltop]] neighborhood. The area shares more in common with Tacoma's downtown owing to its urban nature and large population of apartment-dwelling working class residents. The area consists primarily of businesses and apartment buildings, some with views of [[Commencement Bay]]. Like most of downtown Tacoma, the area is [[gentrification|gentrifying]].
