Having been approved by the Ministry of Education in 2000, '''China Three Gorges University''' (<U+4E09><U+5CE1><U+5927><U+5B66>, CTGU) was founded in [[Yichang]] City, at the entrance of Xilin Gorge (one of the Three Gorges). CTGU is a comprehensive university formed as a merger of the University of Hydraulic and Electric Engineering at Yichang and Hubei Sanxia University.

CTGU consists of 20 teaching units. They are

*College of Civil & Hydroelectric Engineering  
*College of Mechanical & Material Engineering  
*College of Electrical Engineering & Information Technology 
*College of Economics & Management 
*College of Medical Science 
*College of Arts 
*College of Law 
*College of Science 
*College of Chemistry and Life Science 
*College of Performing & Fine Arts 
*College of Foreign Languages  
*College of Physical Education  
*College of science and technology 
*College of Adult Education 
*College of Nursing Science 
*College of Vocational Technology 
*College of Modern Education Technology 
*College of Teacher Training ("Normal College")
*College of Clinical Science
*College of Clinical Science

The university offers 10 specialties for postgraduate students, and there are 19 more specialties for Master program, and Doctoral program which are presently being developed. There are 44 specialties for undergraduate students, which cover 8 fields, such as science, engineering, medicine, arts, management, economics, law and pedagogy. In June 2002, the specialty of Civil Engineering in the university passed the evaluation of the Specialty Committee on Civil Engineering in High Education of the Ministry of Construction; and 6 new specialties for undergraduate students and the College of Science and Technology passed the standard evaluation of the Educational Department of Hubei Province. 

In Yichang, local hydroelectricity and tourism construction are developing rapidly. There is a long history of the culture of famous people and folk custom; there is a rich resource of traditional Chinese medicine and ecological environment. All of these provide superior conditions for the university to carry out education and scientific research, to develop characteristic disciplines and special fields of study. The campus now occupies 200 hectares, and the total building area comprises 830,000m2. The libraries contain close to 2,000,000 volumes. The whole value of teaching equipment is nearly 100 million Yuan.
                
CTGU actively grasps the opportunities of the state's opening and development, and carries out the strategy of enhancing science and education to help the country prosper. It has also taken advantage of scientific personnel so as to serve the state's key projects and local economic development. In recent years, CTGU has undertaken and completed over 100 research studies at the state or provincial level, including the state<U+2019>s key tasks, such as the China Natural Scientific Fund, the State Electric Power Corporation and the Huo Yingdong Fund. The university has achieved a group of international first class scientific achievements, and in particular has made important contributions to the construction of the Three Gorges Project and the Qingjiang Valley development project

The newly merged CTGU, which is involved in the great reforms of nationwide universities, aims at running "the nationwide provincial first-class comprehensive university, famous both at home and abroad" and "having a foothold in Yichang, fusing into the Three Gorges Area, contributing to Hubei Province, gearing to the needs of the whole country, and going into the world". CTGU puts the stress on the construction of key subjects, emphasizes the strength of in hydroelectric engineering and the Three Gorges Culture, develops the education of postgraduates, and improves the level of teaching and scientific research to run the university well. In 2010, CTGU will recruit 24,500 full-time students, including postgraduates and overseas students, and build a group of key subjects and key labs at the provincial level. CTGU will be built into a new university town full of the flavour of the age, with distinctive features of hydroelectric engineering and the Three Gorges Culture, first-class architecture and facilities and an excellent environment.

Among the universities outside [[Wuhan]], the capital of [[Hubei]], CTGU is the largest comprehensive university under the Hubei Provincial Government. There are over 20,400 full-time students in the university, including three-year schooling students, undergraduates, postgraduates and overseas students; there are another 11,000 adult students studying in our university now. CTGU has 1,337 full-time teachers, including more than 575 professors and associate professors, more than 404 teachers who have a Doctoral Degree or Masters Degree, and over 30 teachers who are young scientific and technical experts who greatly contribute and enjoy the government allowance of the State Council. There is also 1 Chutian scholar, and 3 Sanxia scholars, 24 teachers as provincial cross-century discipline forerunners and academic backbones and 94 teachers as university discipline forerunners and academic backbones. There are also 110 supervisors for postgraduate students and PhD students, 180 part-time professors, including 10 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
 
The university takes advantage of the location and endeavors to serve the hydroelectric industry, local economic and social development by implementing the principle of combining production, study and research. In recent 3 years, the university has undertaken and completed 1075 research items at all kinds of levels, and achieved a number of science and technology achievements, which reach the international level and first-class national level, especially in the construction a lot to the Three Gorges Project and the development of Qingjiang river.
 
CTGU has already established cooperative relationships with 45 universities abroad such as France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia, the United Kingdom. The cooperation extends to teaching, scientific research and student exchanges. So far, the cooperations have greatly improved scientific research and talent cultivation. 

CTGU puts stress on the development of the key disciplines and key laboratories, improves its organizational structure, and eventually forms five subject groups including hydroelectric energy engineering, hazard protection and environment, information technology and control engineering, the Three Gorges culture and tourism, and life science and biological technology. Now the university endeavors to develop the education of postgraduates and to improve the level of teaching, scientific research, and administration.

By 2010, CTGU will recruit over 30,000 full-time undergraduates, postgraduate and foreign students, and institute a group of key subjects (key laboratories) at the provincial and state level, and doctoral and master programs. We firmly believe that in the near future, CTGU will be built into a new university town, full of the flavor of a new century, with the distinctive features of hydroelectric engineering and the Three Gorges culture, first-class architecture and facilities, and an excellent environment.
