'''Dunk Island''' lies 4 km off the [[Australia|Australian]] east coast, opposite the town of [[Mission Beach, Queensland|Mission Beach]]<ref name="factsheet"/>. The island forms part of the [[Family Islands National Park]] and is in the larger [[Great Barrier Reef|Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area]]<ref name="epa">{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/projects/park/index.cgi?parkid=202|title=Family Island National Park|publisher=EPA/QPWS|accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref>.

==Geology and wildlife==

Dunk Island is by far the largest island in the [[Family Islands National Park]], all of which consist of [[granite]] rock<ref name="epanature">{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/parks_and_forests/find_a_park_or_forest/family_islands_national_park/family_islands_national_park__nature_culture_and_history/#nature_culture_and_history|title=Family Islands National Park <U+2014> Nature, culture and history|publisher=EPA/QPWS|accessdate=2008-06-13}}</ref>. All of the islands were part of the mainland before the last [[sea level rise]] began 8,000 years ago. Dunk Island covers 970[[hectares|ha]], of which 730ha is national park and the rest is [[Fee simple|freehold]]. Its topography varies, with sandy beaches and rocky shores, slightly undulating slopes, foothills and steeper semi-rugged terrain. Mt Kootaloo is the island's highest point, at 271m above sea level.

There are over 100 species of birds on Dunk Island, including rare and vulnerable seabirds<ref name="epanature"/>. During the summer months, the island becomes a breeding site for [[Tern|terns]] and [[Noddy (tern)|noddies]]. The lack of predators, along with a plentiful supply of food from the surrounding [[reef]] waters, make it an ideal nesting site. Dunk Island is also home to reptiles such as [[Pythonidae|pythons]], [[Brown tree snake|tree snakes]], [[Monitor lizard|monitor lizards]], [[Gecko|geckos]] and [[Skink|skinks]]. The island's [[Fringing reef|fringing reefs]] and surrounding waters are home to an array of marine life such as [[Sea turtle|sea turtles]], [[Dugong|dugongs]], [[Coral|corals]], [[fish]], [[shellfish]] and [[crab|crabs]].

==History==

===Early history===
The traditional [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] owners of Dunk Island are the the Bandjin and Djiru people<ref name="epa"/>, who have lived in this area for tens of thousands of years<ref name="epanature"/>. After the sea level rise, they paddled to the islands in bark canoes to gather food and materials. The Aboriginal name for Dunk Island is Coonanglebah, or <U+201C>The Island of Peace and Plenty<U+201D>.<ref name="factsheet"/> It received its European name from [[Captain Cook]], who sailed past it on [[June 8]] [[1770]]<ref name="epanature"/>, remarked that it was a "tolerable high island" and named it after [[George Montague-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax]]<ref name="smh">{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/queensland/dunk-island/2005/02/17/1108500203297.html|title=Dunk Island|date=2004-02-08|publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref>.

[[Image:HMS Rattlesnake (1822).jpg|thumb|150px|right|HMS ''Rattlesnake'', painted by Sir [[Oswald Walters Brierly]], 1853.]]Europeans settled the nearby mainland during the [[1800s]], seeking gold, timber and grazing land<ref name="epanature"/>. In [[1848]], [[John MacGillivray]] studied the fauna and flora of the island while [[HMS Rattlesnake (1822)|HMS Rattlesnake]] was anchored off the island for ten days<ref name="gutenberg">{{cite book|last=MacGillivray|first=John|title=Narrative of the Voyage of H.M.S. Rattlesnake|publisher=T. & W. Boone|location=London|date=1852|volume=1|chapter=1.3|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12433/12433-h/12433-h.htm|accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref>. He subsequently wrote of its natural features in the ''Narrative of the Voyage of HMS Rattlesnake'', published in England in 1852<ref name="smh"/>.

{{Quotation|Dunk Island, eight or nine miles in circumference, is well wooded<U+2014>it has two conspicuous peaks, one of which (the North-West one) is 857 feet in height. Our excursions were confined to the vicinity of the watering place and the bay in which it is situated. The shores are rocky on one side and sandy on the other, where a low point runs out to the westward. At their junction, and under a sloping hill with large patches of brush, a small stream of fresh water, running out over the beach, furnished a supply for the ship, although the boats could approach the place closely only at high-water.|John MacGillivray|Narrative of the Voyage of HMS Rattlesnake}}

Dunk Island's most famous resident, [[Edmund James Banfield]], moved to the island with his wife in [[1897]] and stayed until his death in [[1923]]<ref name="smh"/>. He recorded his life on the island in a series of books, the most famous of which was ''The Confessions of a Beachcomber''<ref name="banfield">{{cite book|last=Banfield|first=Edmund|title=Confessions of a Beachcomber|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/5113|accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref>.

===World War II and the development of the resort===
[[Image:Dunk Island.jpg|thumb|200px|Dunk Island, photographed from Bicton Hill, towards the North of Mission Beach]]The island was bought in [[1934]] by Captain Brassey and Banfield's bungalow provided the basis for the beginnings of a resort<ref name="smh"/>. The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] occupied Dunk Island during [[World War II]], building its airstrip in [[1941]]<ref name="epanature"/>. They installed a radar station on the island's highest point a year later, which was then dismantled when the war ended in [[1945]]. The Brassey family returned to the island after the war, but sold it to Eric McElree of [[Avis Rent a Car System|Avis Rent-A-Car]] in [[1956]], who upgraded the resort's facilities. In [[1976]], Trans Australian Airlines purchased Dunk Island. Ownership then passed to [[Qantas]] in [[1992]], following its merger with Australian Airlines. On [[December 24]] [[1997]], the island was purchased by P&O Australian Resorts, who were then acquired by current owners [[Voyages]] in [[July]] [[2004]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voyages.com.au/corporate/our-journey/|title=Our Journey|publisher=[[Voyages]]|accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref>

===Cyclone Larry===

On [[March 20]] [[2006]], [[Cyclone Larry]] hit Dunk Island as the [[Tropical cyclone scales#South Pacific|Category 5]] storm crossed the coast of [[Queensland]]. Around 160 staff members and 280 guests had been evacuated to [[Cairns]], but 20 [[Voyages]] staff stayed behind on the island<ref name="adelaidenow">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,20525613-5006339,00.html|title=Slammed Dunk is back |last=Wright|first=John|date=2006-10-07|publisher=AdelaideNow...|accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref>. The resort suffered structural and water damage<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voyages.com.au/media/200/|title=TNQ Islands Closed in Wake of Cyclone Larry|date=2006-03-20|publisher=[[Voyages]]|accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref>, but reopened on [[July 1]] [[2006]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voyages.com.au/media/206/|title=Voyages Dunk & Bedarra Islands Re-opening Update|date=2006-05-17|publisher=[[Voyages]]|accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref> after an estimated [[Australian dollar|$]]20 million of refurbishment and rebuilding<ref name="adelaidenow"/>.

==Land use==

===National park===
[[Image:Dunk.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Mt Kootaloo behind Brammo Bay, Dunk Island]]
Dunk Island has thirteen kilometres of walking tracks spread over five main routes, ranging from a short walk to Edmund James Banfield's grave to a 4 hour island circuit hike<ref name="epafeatures">{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/parks_and_forests/find_a_park_or_forest/family_islands_national_park/|title=Family Island National Park - features|publisher=EPA/QPWS|accessdate=2008-06-13}}</ref>. Commercial operators offer guided tours around the island, as does the Dunk Island resort.

===Resort===

Dunk Island Resort is run by [[Voyages]], a relatively exclusive 160 room resort popular with couples<ref name="factsheet"/>. Its facilities include two restaurants, two bars, a caf<U+00E9>, a spa and a 9-hole golf course. The resort offers a number of free and paid activities for its guests, including day trips to other parts of the Great Barrier Reef.

===Camping ground===

There is also a camping ground available for visitors as part of the national park, although a permit is required for its use<ref name="epafeatures"/>.

===Artists' colony===

Dunk Island is also home to a small community of artists who live, work and showcase their work on a property on the southern side of the island<ref name="guardianfi">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2005/oct/29/onlocationfilminspiredtravel.australia.guardiansaturdaytravelsection?page=all|title=Fantasy island|last=Woodard|first=Amanda|date=2005-10-29|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2008-06-13}}</ref>. The Colony was established in [[1974]] by former Olympic wrestler Bruce Arthur, and has continued to operate after his death in [[1989]], now run by Susie Kirk.

===Airstrip===

Dunk Island also has a small airstrip, [[Dunk Island Airport]], located near the resort, with frequent flights to [[Cairns]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dunk-island.com/getting/|title=Getting to Dunk Island and back|publisher=[[Voyages]]|accessdate=2008-06-13}}</ref>.

==In popular culture==
Dunk Island was chosen as the location for the [[1969]] film ''[[Age of Consent (film)|Age of Consent]]'', which was based on a story by the artist and writer [[Norman Lindsay]]<ref name="guardianfi"/>. Directed by [[Michael Powell]], it starred [[James Mason]] as Bradley Morahan, a jaded Australian artist returning from New York and [[Helen Mirren]] as Cora Ryan, a local teenager. ''Age of Consent'' attracted controversy over nudity and a sex scene, which led to some censorship and cuts. Much of the film was shot on the beach at Brammo Bay where ferries bringing visitors now dock.
