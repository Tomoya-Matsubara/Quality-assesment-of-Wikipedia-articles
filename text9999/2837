'''Chicxulub Crater''' <!-- ({{Audio-IPA|Mgm pronunciation Knut.ogg|t<U+0283>ik<U+0283>u<U+02C8>lub}}) -->({{IPA2|t<U+0283>ik<U+0283>u<U+02C8>lub}}) is an ancient [[impact crater]] buried underneath the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]], with its center located near the town of [[Chicxulub, Yucat<U+00E1>n|Chicxulub]], [[Yucat<U+00E1>n]], [[Mexico]]. The crater is over 180&nbsp;kilometers (110&nbsp;mi) in diameter, making the feature one of the largest confirmed impact structures in the world; the [[asteroid]] or [[comet]] whose impact formed the crater was at least 10&nbsp;km (6&nbsp;mi) in diameter. The crater was named for the nearby town, as well as for the literal [[Maya]] translation of the name: "tail of the [[Satan|devil]]."<ref name=penfield />

The crater was discovered by Glen Penfield, a geophysicist who had been working in the Yucat<U+00E1>n while looking for [[petroleum|oil]] during the late 1970s. The presence of [[tektite]]s, [[shocked quartz]] and [[gravity anomaly|gravity anomalies]], as well as the age of the rocks and [[isotope analysis]], show that this impact structure dates from the late [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]], roughly 65 [[million years ago]]. The impact associated with the crater is [[Cretaceous<U+2013>Tertiary extinction event|implicated in causing the extinction]] of the [[dinosaur]]s as suggested by the [[K<U+2013>T boundary]], although some critics disagree that the impact was the sole reason<ref name=bakker>Bakker interview. "Does the [impact theory] explain the extinction of the dinosaurs? There ''are'' problems..."</ref> and also debate whether there was a single impact or whether the Chicxulub impactor was one of several that may have struck the Earth at around the same time. Recent evidence suggests that the impactor was a piece of a much larger asteroid which broke up in a collision more than 160 million years ago.<ref name=Bottke/>

== Discovery ==
In 1978, geophysicist Glen Penfield had been working for the Mexican state-owned oil company, [[Pemex|Petroleos Mexicanos]] (PEMEX), as a staff member for an airborne magnetic survey of the Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula. Penfield's job was to use geophysical data to scout possible locations for oil drilling.<ref name=bates>Bates.</ref> With aerial surveys, he attempted to use magnetic data to find underground oil deposits. When Penfield examined the survey data, he found a huge underground arc with "extraordinary symmetry" in an enormous ring, 70&nbsp;km (40&nbsp;mi) across.<ref name=penfield>Penfield.</ref> Penfield then obtained a gravity map of the Yucat<U+00E1>n that had been made in the [[1960s]]. He found another arc, but this one was on the Yucat<U+00E1>n itself, and its ends pointed north. He compared the two maps and found that the two arcs joined to form a circle, 180&nbsp;km (111&nbsp;mi) wide, with its center near the village of [[Puerto Chicxulub]]. Penfield was certain that the arrangement was created by a single event in geologic history.

Although PEMEX would not allow him to release specific data, the company did allow him and PEMEX official Antonio Camargo to present their results at a geological conference in 1981.<ref>Weinreb.</ref> The conference was under-attended that year, ironically because most geologists were attending a workshop on Earth impacts, and their report attracted very little attention. While Penfield had plenty of geophysical data sets, he had no physical evidence of an impact in the form of rock cores.<ref name=bates/>

Penfield knew that PEMEX had drilled exploratory wells in the region in 1951. One of the wells had bored into a thick layer of [[andesite]] about 1.3&nbsp;kilometers (4,200&nbsp;ft) down. Such a structure could have resulted from the intense heat and pressures of an Earth impact, but at the time of the borings it had been written off as a "[[volcanic dome]]", even though such a feature was out of place in the geology of the region. Penfield attempted to secure samples from these sites, but was told that all the samples had been lost or destroyed.<ref name=bates/> Attempts at returning to the drill sites and looking for rocks proved fruitless. Penfield abandoned his search, published his findings, and returned to working for PEMEX at the same time scientist [[Luis Walter Alvarez]] proposed his hypothesis that a giant extraterrestrial body had struck the earth. 

[[Image:Chicxulub shockedquartz.png|thumb|left|Penfield with the sample of shocked quartz found at Well #2, Chicxulub.]]Meanwhile, Alan R. Hildebrand, a graduate student at the [[University of Arizona]], was searching for a crater, unaware of Penfield's discovery. In 1981 Hildebrand and his faculty advisor, William V. Boynton, published their preliminary theory about an earth impact.<ref>Mason.</ref> Their evidence included a greenish-brown coloured clay with an excess of [[iridium]] which contained [[shocked quartz]] grains and small beads of weathered [[glass]] that appeared to be [[tektite]]s.<ref>Hildebrand, Penfield, ''et al''.</ref> There was also the presence of thick, jumbled deposits of coarse rock fragments, thought to have been scoured up from one location and deposited elsewhere by a kilometers-high [[tsunami]] that most likely resulted from an Earth impact.<ref name=alanhild2/> Such deposits occur in many locations but seem to be concentrated in the [[Caribbean Basin]] at the [[K<U+2013>T boundary]].<ref name=alanhild2>Hildebrand interview: "Similar deposits of rubble occur all across the southern coast of North America [...] indicate that something extraordinary happened here."</ref> At the same time, Florentine Moras, a Haitan professor, discovered what he believed was evidence of an ancient volcano on [[Haiti]]; Hildebrand suggested it might be another distinctive feature of an impact nearby.<ref name=moras>Mor<U+00E1>s.</ref> Tests on samples retrieved from the K<U+2013>T boundary revealed more tektite glass, associated only with asteroid impacts and the site of high yield [[atom bomb|nuclear detonations]].<ref name=moras />

In 1990, Carlos Byars, a reporter for the [[Houston Chronicle]], contacted Hildebrand and told him that Penfield had discovered what might be the impact crater years earlier.<ref name=Frankel>Frankel, 50.</ref> After Hildebrand got in touch with Penfield in April 1990, the two men were able to locate two separate samples from the wells drilled by PEMEX, which were stored in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].<ref name=alanhild>Hildebrand interview.</ref> Sending the samples back to Hildebrand, Hildebrand and his team performed tests, which clearly showed [[Metamorphic rock|shock-metamorphic]] materials in the samples.

In 1996, a team of California researchers, including [[Kevin O. Pope]], Adriana Ocampo, and Charles Duller, conducted a survey of satellite images of the region. They found that there was a ring of [[sinkhole]]s centered on Puerto Chicxulub that matched the ring Penfield had found in his data. The sinkholes were likely caused by [[subsidence]] of the crater's wall.<ref>Pope, Baines, ''et al''.</ref> Recent evidence suggests that the actual crater is 300&nbsp;kilometers (190&nbsp;mi) wide, and the 180&nbsp;kilometer ring is just an inner wall.<ref>Sharpton & Marin.</ref>

== Impact specifics ==
[[Image:Chicxulub-animation.gif|thumb|right|An animation showing the impact, and subsequent crater formation. (University of Arizona, Space Imagery Center)]]
The impactor's estimated size was about 10&nbsp;km (6&nbsp;mi) in diameter and may have released an estimated 500&nbsp;[[zetta]][[joule]]s {{nowrap|(5.0 &times; 10<sup>23</sup> [[joule]]s)}} of energy, equivalent to 100 [[teraton]]s of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] (10<sup>14</sup> tons),<ref>Bralower, ''et al''.</ref> on impact.  By contrast, the most powerful man-made explosive device ever detonated, the [[Tsar Bomba]] or Emperor Bomb, had a [[Nuclear weapon yield|yield]] of only 50 [[megaton]]s,<ref>Adamsky and Smirnov, 19.</ref> making the Chicxulub impact 2 million times more powerful.<ref>Adamsky and Smirnov, 20.</ref>

The impact caused some of the largest [[megatsunami]]s in Earth's history, hitting the Caribbean island of [[Cuba]] especially hard. A cloud of dust, ash and steam would have spread from the crater, as the impactor burrowed underground in less than a second.<ref>Milosh, interview.</ref> Pieces of the impactor, ejected out of the atmosphere by the blast, would have been heated to incandescence upon reentry, broiling the Earth's surface and igniting global wildfires; meanwhile, [[shock wave]]s spawned global [[earthquakes]] and [[volcanic eruption]]s.<ref name=Milosh>Milosh. "On the ground, you would feel an effect similar to an oven on broil, lasting for about an hour [...] causing global forest fires."</ref> The emission of dust and particles could have covered the entire surface of the Earth for several years, possibly a decade, creating a harsh environment for living things to survive in. The shock production of [[carbon dioxide]] caused by the destruction of carbonate rocks would have led to a dramatic [[greenhouse effect]],<ref name=ppg5>Hildebrand, Penfield, ''et al''; 5.</ref> and sunlight would have been filtered out by dust particles in the atmosphere. The [[photosynthesis]] of plants would be interrupted, subsequently affecting the entire [[food chain]].<ref name=perlman>Perlman.</ref><ref name=popeandocampo>Pope, Ocampo, ''et al''.</ref>

===Geology and morphology===
In their 1991 paper, Hildebrand, Penfield, and company described the geology and composition of the impact feature.<ref>Hildebrand, Penfield, ''et al''; 1.</ref> The rocks above the impact feature are layers of marl and [[limestone]] reaching to almost 1,000&nbsp;meters (3,300&nbsp;ft) in depth. These rocks date back as far as the [[Paleocene]].<ref name=ppg3>Hildebrand, Penfield, ''et al''; 3.</ref> Below these layers lie more than 500&nbsp;m (1600&nbsp;ft) of [[andesite]] glass and [[breccia]]. These andesitic [[igneous rock]]s were found only within the supposed impact feature; similarly, quantities of [[feldspar]] and [[augite]], normally only found in impact-melt rocks, are present,<ref>Grieve.</ref> as is [[shocked quartz]].<ref name=ppg3/> The K<U+2013>T boundary inside the feature is depressed between 600 and 1100&nbsp;m compared to the normal depth of about 500&nbsp;m (1600&nbsp;ft) depth 5&nbsp;km (3&nbsp;mi) away from the impact feature.<ref name=ppg4>Hildebrand, Penfield, ''et al''; 4.</ref> Along the edge of the crater are clusters of [[cenote]]s or sinkholes, which suggest that there was a water basin inside the feature during the [[Tertiary period]], after the impact.<ref name=ppg4/> Such a basin's groundwater dissolved the [[limestone]] and created the caves and cenotes beneath the surface.<ref>Kring, "Discovering the Crater".</ref> The paper also noted that the crater seemed to be a good candidate source for the tektites reported at Haiti.<ref>Sigurdsson.</ref>

===Origin===
On [[September 5]], [[2007]] a report was issued in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' that proposed an origin of the asteroid that created Chicxulub Crater.<ref name=perlman/> The authors, [[William F. Bottke]], David Vokrouhlick<U+00FD>, and David Nesvorn<U+00FD>, argue that a collision in the asteroid belt 160 million years ago resulted in the creation of the [[Baptistina family]] of asteroids, the largest surviving member of which is [[298 Baptistina]]. They proposed that the "Chicxulub asteroid" was also a member of this group. The connection between Chicxulub and Baptistina is supported by the large amount of carbonaecous material present in microscopic fragments of the impactor, suggesting the impactor was a member of a rare class of asteroids called [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s, like Baptistina.<ref name=Bottke/> According to Bottke, the Chicxulub impactor was a fragment of a much larger parent body about 170 km (105 mi) across, with the other impacting body being around 60&nbsp;km (40&nbsp;mi) in diameter.<ref>Ingham.</ref><ref name=Bottke>Bottke, Vokrouhlicky, Nesvorny.</ref>

===Chicxulub and dinosaur extinction===
{{main|Cretaceous<U+2013>Tertiary extinction event}}
[[Image:Iridium clay layer.png|thumb|right|Alvarez holding the piece of clay which sparked research into the impact theory. The second green band from the bottom is extremely high in [[iridium]].]]
The Chicxulub Crater lends support to the theory postulated by the late [[physicist]] [[Luis Alvarez]] and his son, [[geologist]] [[Walter Alvarez]], for the extinction of the [[dinosaur]]s by an asteroid. The Alvarezes, at the time both faculty members at the [[UC Berkeley|University of California, Berkeley]], postulated that the extinction of the dinosaurs, roughly contemporaneous with the [[Cretaceous<U+2013>Tertiary extinction event|K<U+2013>T boundary]], could have been caused by just such a large impact.<ref>Alvarez, W. interview.</ref> This theory is now widely, though not universally, accepted by the [[scientific community]]. Some critics, including [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Robert Bakker]], argue that such an impact would have killed [[frog]]s as well as dinosaurs, yet the frogs survived the extinction event.<ref>Kring, "Environment Consequences".</ref> Gerta Keller of [[Princeton University]] argues that recent core samples from Chicxulub prove the impact occurred about 300,000 years ''before'' the extinction of the dinosaurs, and thus could not have been the cause of their demise.<ref>Keller, ''et al''.</ref>

The main evidence of such an impact, besides the crater itself, is a widespread, thin layer of clay present in the K<U+2013>T boundary across the world. In the late [[1970s]], the Alvarezes and colleagues reported<ref name=alvarez>Alvarez.</ref> that it contained an abnormally high concentration of [[iridium]]. In this layer, iridium levels reached 6 parts per billion by weight or more compared to 0.4<ref>Web Elements.</ref> for the Earth's crust as a whole; in comparison, meteorites can contain around 470 parts per billion<ref>Quivx.</ref> of this element.  It was hypothesised that the iridium was spread into the atmosphere when the impactor was vapourized and settled across the Earth's surface amongst other material thrown up by the impact, producing the relatively iridium-rich layer of clay.<ref>Mayell.</ref>

==Multiple impact theory==
{{seealso|Roche limit}}
In recent years, several other craters of around the same age as Chicxulub have been discovered, all between latitudes 20<U+00B0>N and 70<U+00B0>N.  Examples include the [[Silverpit crater]] in the [[North Sea]],<ref>Stewart, Allen.</ref> and the [[Boltysh crater]] in [[Ukraine]].<ref>Kelley, Gurov.</ref> Both are much smaller than Chicxulub, but likely to have been caused by objects many tens of metres across striking the Earth.<ref>Stewart.</ref> This has led to the hypothesis that the Chicxulub impact may have been only one of several impacts that happened nearly at the same time.<ref name=multiple/> Another possible crater thought to have been formed at the same time is the [[Shiva crater]], though the structure's status as a crater is contested.<ref>Mullen, "Shiva".</ref>

The collision of [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] with Jupiter in 1994 proved that gravitational interactions can fragment a comet, giving rise to many impacts over a period of a few days if the comet should collide with a planet. Comets frequently undergo gravitational interactions with the gas giants, and similar disruptions and collisions are very likely to have occurred in the past.<ref name=Weisstein>Weisstein.</ref> This scenario may have occurred on Earth 65 million years ago.<ref name=multiple>Mullen, "Multiple Impacts".</ref>

In late 2006, Ken MacLeod, a [[geology]] professor from the [[University of Missouri<U+2013>Columbia]], completed an analysis of [[sediment]] below the ocean's surface bolstering the single-impact theory. MacLeod conducted his analysis approximately 4,500&nbsp;kilometers (2,800&nbsp;mi) from the Chicxulub Crater to control for possible changes in soil composition at the impact site while still close enough to be affected by the impact. The analysis revealed there was only one layer of impact debris in the sediment, which indicated there was only one impact.<ref>Than.</ref> Multiple-impact proponents such as [[Gerta Keller]] regard the results as "rather hyper-inflated" and do not agree with the conclusion of MacLeod's analysis.<ref>Dunham.</ref>
