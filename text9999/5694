'''Weston-super-Mare''' is a [[constituency]] represented in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election.

== Boundaries ==
The constituency covers the southern half of [[North Somerset|North Somerset]] Unitary Authority, including the town of [[Weston-super-Mare]], the villages of [[Kewstoke]], [[Locking, North Somerset|Locking]], [[Hutton, Somerset|Hutton]], [[Banwell]], [[Winscombe]], [[Congresbury]], [[Churchill, Somerset|Churchill]] and [[Blagdon]], and several smaller villages.

Boundary changes effective at the [[Next United Kingdom general election|next General Election]] will cause Weston constituency to lose the village of [[Butcombe]] to the new [[North Somerset (UK Parliament constituency)|North Somerset]] constituency (the successor to [[Woodspring (UK Parliament constituency)|Woodspring]]).

This is a minor boundary change to make the constituency boundary conform to local authority ward boundaries. The change affects only around 100 electors.
