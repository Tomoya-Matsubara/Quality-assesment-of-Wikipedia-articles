'''Niels Carl Michaelius (Michael) Flindt Dahl''', usually known as '''Carl Dahl''', (24 March 1812, [[Faaborg]] <U+2013> 7 April 1865, [[Frederiksberg]]) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] marine painter during the [[Golden Age of Danish Painting]].

==Biography==

In 1835, Dahl entered the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Danish Academy]] where he ultimately specialized in [[marine painting]] under [[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg]] who took him to [[Langelinie]] where he was able to paint frigates and liners in their natural environment. In addition to a study tour of [[Italy]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], he travelled to [[Lisbon]] (1840), [[Germany]] and [[France]] (1852 and 1855), [[Norway]] (1861) and to [[London]] and the [[Faroe Islands]] (1862). As a result of his interest in marine painting, he bacame one of Eckersberg's closest friends in the 1840s as they helped each other to complete their paintings.<ref name=SMK>"C. W. Eckersberg og hans elever", ''Statens Museum for Kunst'', 1983, p. 93.</ref><ref name=Weilbach>[http://runeberg.org/dbl/4/0143.html Philip Weilbach, "Dahl, Niels Carl Michaelius Flindt"], Dansk biografisk leksikon, vol. 4, p. 141, ''Gyldendal'' (1887<U+2013>1905).</ref>

In 1849, he won the Neuhausen prize for his ''Skibe, der ere passerede Kronborg''. Despite his mastery of perspecitive, he lacked the freedom of artistic expression which would have contibuted to the value of his paintings. His most important work is considered to be ''S<U+00F8>tr<U+00E6>fningen ved Helgoland'' now in Frederiksberg Museum. Other notable works include ''Parti fra Larsens Plads ved havnen i K<U+00F8>benhavn'' (c. 1840), ''Lissabons rhed'' (1843) and ''Fregat i en storm med rebede undersejl''.<ref name=SMK/><ref name=Weilbach/>
