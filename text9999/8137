'''William Jennings Jefferson''' (born [[March 14]], [[1947]]) is an [[Politics of the United States|American politician]] from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Louisiana]]. A [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]], Jefferson has been a member of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] since [[1991]]. He represents {{ushr|Louisiana|2|}}, which includes much of the [[New Orleans metropolitan area|greater New Orleans]] area. He is Louisiana's first black Congressman since the end of [[Reconstruction]].<ref>{{cite news | title = The Legal Woes Of Rep. Jefferson | author = Murray, Shailagh and Lengel, Allan | page = A01 | date = [[2006-02-16]] | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/15/AR2006021502752.html | publisher = Washington Post | accessdate = 2007-02-07 }}</ref>  He is currently the subject of a corruption probe, and in May 2006 his Congressional offices were raided, as well as his home in Northeast Washington, where, the FBI alleged, they "found $90,000 of the cash in the freezer, in $10,000 increments wrapped in aluminum foil and stuffed inside frozen-food containers."

In the midterm election on November 7, 2006, Jefferson received 30% of the vote against several opponents, and then proceeded to win in a runoff election against [[Louisiana State Legislature|Louisiana State Representative]] [[Karen Carter]] on [[December 9]], [[2006]].

==Early life and career==
Jefferson was born in [[Lake Providence, Louisiana|Lake Providence]], a small town in [[East Carroll Parish]] in far northeastern Louisiana, where he and his eight brothers and sisters worked alongside their father, who was a [[Sharecropping|sharecropper]] and a heavy-equipment operator for the [[Army Corps of Engineers]]. 

Though neither of his parents had graduated from high school, Jefferson graduated from G.W. Griffin High School in Lake Providence and received a [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Southern University]], where in [[1969]] he led a protest against substandard campus facilities and negotiated with then-[[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[John McKeithen]].  He later earned a law degree from [[Harvard University]] in 1972.  After graduation, he became a law clerk for Judge Alvin B. Rubin of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana]] from 1972 to 1973, and a lawyer with a private practice. From [[1973]] to [[1975]], he was a legislative assistant to [[U.S. Senator]] [[Bennett Johnston|J. Bennett Johnston, Jr.]], of Louisiana. He moved to New Orleans in 1976 and was elected as a member of the [[Louisiana Senate]] in [[1980]], where he served until 1991. He twice unsuccessfully ran for [[Mayor of New Orleans|New Orleans mayor]], first challenging [[Ernest N. Morial]] in the [[New Orleans mayoral election, 1982|election of 1982]], and then being defeated by [[Sidney Barthelemy]] in the [[New Orleans mayoral election, 1986|mayoral runoff of 1986]].<ref>Grady, Bill.  "Mayor's runoff:  one goal, two contenders." ''The New Orleans Times-Picayune'', February 23, 1986.</ref>  In 1990 William Jefferson was elected to the House, becoming the first black member of Congress from Louisiana since Reconstruction. In the House, Jefferson joined the [[Congressional Black Caucus]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=J000070 bioguide.congress.gov | title = JEFFERSON, William Jennings, (1947 - ) | publisher = Biographical Directory of the United States Congress | accessdate = 2007-02-07 }}</ref>

==Local influence==
Jefferson and his family control one of the most sophisticated and effective get-out-the-vote organizations in South Louisiana: the [[New Orleans Progressive Democrats|Progressive Democrats]].  In 2002, their political machine helped Jefferson's prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>e [[Ren<U+00E9>e Gill Pratt]] being elected as a [[Councilmember]], even though it was unable to ensure that Jefferson's daughter [[Jalila Jefferson|Jalila]] would succeed Pratt as a [[Louisiana State Representatives|Representative]] to the [[Louisiana State Legislature|Louisiana State House]].  It also contributed to the election of Jefferson's sister [[Betty Jefferson|Betty]] as a municipal assessor, in 1998, 2002 and 2006.

In recent years, New Orleans-based political machines in general have lost clout.  This trend has accelerated since thousands of [[New Orleans|New Orleanians]] were scattered across the [[United States]], in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]].  The influence of the [[New Orleans Progressive Democrats|Progressive Democrats]] in particular may be compromised even more by the current corruption investigation that affects Jefferson.

==Actions following Hurricane Katrina==
Jefferson has received criticism for his actions in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  Five days after the hurricane made landfall, Jefferson utilized a National Guard detachment to recover personal effects and belongings from his home.<ref>{{cite news | title = Amid Katrina Chaos, Congressman Used National Guard to Visit Home | first = Jake | last = Tapper | publisher = ABC News | url = http://www.abcnews.go.com/US/HurricaneKatrina/story?id=1123495&page=1 | date = [[2005-09-13]] | accessdate = 2006-02-07 }}</ref>  After the truck in which he and the detachment traveled became stuck, further National Guard resources were expended (amidst ongoing search and rescue operations) to aid the original detachment, including a second truck and helicopter.

==Corruption investigation==		
Jefferson has been under investigation by the FBI for suspected corruption since [[March]] [[2005]]. Since that time, he has been named in the guilty pleas of two associates. On [[15 May]] [[2006]], Jefferson called a press conference at which he announced that he did not intend to resign, despite expecting to be indicted on corruption charges. On [[20 May]] [[2006]], Jefferson's Congressional offices were searched by the FBI, "believed to be the first-ever FBI raid on a Congressional office,"<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.rollcall.com/issues/1_1/breakingnews/13467-1.html | publisher = RollCall | title = FBI Raid Angers Some on Hill; Feds Probe Additional Jefferson <U+2018>Schemes<U+2019> | first = John | last = Bresnahan | date = [[2006-05-21]] | accessdate = 2007-02-06 }}</ref> raising concerns that it could "set a dangerous precedent that could be used by future administrations to intimidate or harass a supposedly coequal branch of the government."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/24/washington/24cong.html?_r=1&oref=slogin | publisher = New York Times | title = F.B.I.

An investigation of Jefferson by various agencies began in mid-2005, after an investor came to authorities. Jefferson is alleged to have received over $400,000 in bribes through a company maintained in the name of his spouse and children. The money came from a tech company named [http://igateinc.com/ iGate, Inc.] of [[Louisville, Kentucky]], and in return, it is alleged, Jefferson would help iGate's business. Jefferson was to persuade the [[U.S. Army]] to test iGate's [[broadband]] two-way technology and other iGate products; use his efforts to influence, possibly through bribery, high-ranking officials in [[Nigeria]], [[Ghana]], and [[Cameroon]]; and meet with personnel of the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States]], in order to facilitate potential financing for iGate business deals in those countries.<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://washingtondc.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel06/wfo050306.htm FBI.Gov | title = BUSINESSMAN PLEADS GUILTY TO PAYING BRIBES TO U.S. CONGRESSMAN | publisher = [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] | date = [[2006-05-03]] | accessdate = 2007-02-06 }}</ref>

===FBI investigation of bribery and fraud===
On [[30 July]] [[2005]], Jefferson was videotaped by the FBI allegedly receiving $100,000 worth of 100 dollar bills in a leather briefcase at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Arlington, Virginia.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/05/21/D8HOCUJ81.html | title = Filing: Tape Shows Lawmaker Taking Money | publisher = Associated Press | first = Matthew | last = Barakat | date = [[2006-05-21]] | accessdate = 2007-02-07 }}</ref> Jefferson told an investor, Lori Mody, who was wearing a wire, that he would need to give Nigerian Vice President [[Atiku Abubakar]] $500,000 "as a motivating factor" to make sure they obtained contracts for iGate and Mody's company in Nigeria.<ref>{{cite news | title = FBI Says Jefferson Was Filmed Taking Cash | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/21/AR2006052100167.html | publisher = Washington Post | author = [[Allan Lengel|Lengel, Allan]] | date = [[2006-05-21]] | page = A01 | accessdate = 2007-02-07 }}</ref>		
A few days later, on [[3 August]] [[2005]], FBI agents raided Jefferson's home in Northeast Washington and, as noted in an 83-page affidavit filed to support a subsequent raid on his Congressional office, "found $90,000 of the cash in the freezer, in $10,000 increments wrapped in aluminum foil and stuffed inside frozen-food containers."  Serial numbers found on the currency in the freezer matched serial numbers of funds given by the FBI to their informant.

Late in the night of [[20 May]] [[2006]], FBI agents executed a search warrant<ref>[http://www.bayoubuzz.com/jefferson_affdavit.pdf Affadavit and search warrant] (1.25MB PDF)</ref> at Jefferson's office in the [[Rayburn House Office Building]].

The affidavit used to support these raids included, among other allegations:
*The FBI videotaped Jefferson receiving a stock certificate from Mody for a company set up in Nigeria to promote iGate's technology. Jefferson predicted the deal would generate $200 million annually after five years.	
*Jefferson told Mody that he wanted a similar financial stake in the business in Ghana.	
*Jefferson sought $10 million in financing from Mody to take over iGate and install "confidants" on the new board. In two payments, Mody wired $89,225 to the ANJ Group LLC, a company controlled by Jefferson's family.	
*Jefferson lent $4,800 of the money Mody gave him to an unnamed congressional aide. Another $4,900 was given back to the FBI by one of Jefferson's attorneys.	
*The FBI claims it has uncovered "at least seven other schemes in which Jefferson sought things of value in return for his official acts."<ref>[http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-5/1148277709120750.xml nola.com]</ref>

===Former aides plead guilty===
In [[January 2006]], [[Brett M. Pfeffer]], a former aide to Jefferson, implicated him in a corruption scheme involving an Internet company being set up in [[Nigeria]]. Pfeffer was president of an investment company in McLean, Virginia. In return for political support for the deal, Jefferson had legal work directed toward his family's operations. It was also said that a daughter of his was put on retainer of the Virginia investment company to the tune of $5,000 a month. Jefferson also is said to have arranged for his family a 5% to 7% ownership stake in the Nigerian Internet company. Pfeffer pled guilty to charges of aiding and abetting bribery of a public official and conspiracy on [[11 January]] [[2006]] in a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia.<ref>Ana Radelat, Gannett News Service, [http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-01-11-exaideguilty_x.htm ''"Former congressional aide pleads guilty to bribery"''], 1/11/2006. Retrieved Dec. 9, 2006.</ref> On [[May 26]], he was sentenced to eight years, but was "cooperating in an ongoing probe and may be eligible for a sentence reduction afterward", according to a prosecutor.<ref>

On [[3 May]] [[2006]] [[Vernon Jackson]], 53, [[CEO]] of [[Louisville, Kentucky]] based iGate Inc., admitted to bribery of a public official and conspiracy to bribe a public official during a plea hearing in U.S. District Court. According to the [[Associated Press]], "court documents make clear that Congressman William Jefferson (Democrat-Louisiana) is the accused congressman, without naming him." Jackson's plea bargain requires his cooperation in the ongoing investigation against the congressman he admits bribing. The total amount of the bribes is between $400,000 and $1 million, according to court documents of the Jackson proceeding.<ref>[[FBI]], [http://washingtondc.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel06/wfo050306.htm ''"BUSINESSMAN PLEADS GUILTY TO PAYING BRIBES TO U.S. CONGRESSMAN"''], May 3, 2006.

=== Congressional office raid ===
The [[May 20]] raid of Jefferson's office in Room 2113 of the [[Rayburn House Office Building]] set off a series of political events. Jefferson immediately challenged the action in federal court, and members of the House generally reacted strongly against the raid. [[House Speaker]] [[Dennis Hastert]], and [[House Minority Leader]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] issued "a rare joint statement demanding that the FBI return the documents and saying that Jefferson then should cooperate more fully with the investigation."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/05/25/raid.on.congress.ap/index.html ''"Bush orders documents seized in Capitol Hill search sealed"'', CNN]</ref> "Many Republicans and Democrats contend that the unprecedented raid on a congressional office was unduly aggressive and may have breached the constitutional separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches of government that are meant to shelter lawmakers from administrative intimidation."<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/05/25/lawmakers_demand_fbi_return_raid_files/ Shailagh Murray and Allan Lengel, Washington Post], [[May 25]] [[2006]]</ref>  Tensions escalated to the point where, according to AP, [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Alberto Gonzales]], his [[United States Deputy Attorney General|deputy]], [[Paul McNulty]], and possibly [[FBI Director]] [[Robert Mueller]] "were said to be ready to quit if the Justice Department was asked to return the Jefferson documents...[while the] House was threatening to go after the Justice Department's budget."<ref>

On [[May 25]], President Bush stepped in, taking the extraordinary step of "directing the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] to seal all the materials recovered from Congressman William Jefferson's (Democrat-Louisiana) office for the next 45 days and not to allow access to anyone involved in the investigation."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/25/washington/25text-bush.html Text of Bush's order to seal materials for 45 days]</ref>

</ref> on [[30 May]] [[2006]], Representative [[James Sensenbrenner]], chairman of the [[House Judiciary Committee]] began to hold hearings, called  "Reckless Justice: Did the Saturday Night Raid of Congress Trample the Constitution?", on the "profoundly disturbing" questions that he said the Justice Department's actions have raised.

The FBI, in answering Jefferson's complaint of the raid, attached an FBI agent's affidavit claiming that the raid was necessary because while the FBI was searching his home in August, Jefferson tried to "surreptitiously remove" documents.<ref>{{cite web | year=2006| title=Justice Prosecutor's Response to Jefferson Request | url=http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/docs/jefferson-justiceresponse/?resultpage=36& | accessdate=2006-05-31}}</ref>

An ABC News poll released [[1 June]] [[2006]] found 86% of Americans supported the FBI's right to search congressional offices when they obtain a warrant.<ref>{{cite web | year=2006| title=Poll: Americans Support Searches; Public Sides With FBI in Congress Search Issue | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/PollVault/story?id=2025343&page=1 | accessdate=2006-06-05}}</ref>

On July 10, 2006, Chief Judge [[Thomas F. Hogan]] for the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]], ruled the FBI raid on Jefferson's office was legal,<ref> [http://www.washtimes.com/national/20060710-115237-9121r.htm Judge rules FBI raid on Hill office legal] - Jerry Seper and Christina Bellantoni, ''Washington Times'', July 11, 2006 </ref> 
rejecting his and the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the Unites States House of Representatives claim that the search violated the Constitution's [[Speech or Debate Clause]], [[separation of powers]] principle and [[Fourth Amendment]].  Chief Judge Hogan, in a 28-page ruling, acknowledged that the "facts and questions of law presented here are indeed unprecedented," but wrote that it is "well-established" that a Congressman is "generally bound to the operation of the criminal laws as are ordinary persons," and the Speech or Debate Clause does not "make Members of Congress super-citizens, immune from criminal responsibility.'"<ref> {{cite web | year=2006| title= IN RE: SEARCH OF THE RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING ROOM NUMBER 2113 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515| url=http://graphics.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/20060710_RAYBURN_OPINION.pdf | accessdate=2006-07-10}}, citing ''[[United States v. Brewster]]'', 408 U.S. 501, 516.</ref>  Hogan, in his conclusion, wrote:  

:"The existing broad protections of the Speech or Debate Clause <U+2013> absolute immunity from prosecution or suit for legislative acts and freedom from being 'questioned' about those acts (including privilege from the testimonial act of producing documents in response to a subpoena) <U+2013> satisfy the fundamental purpose of the Clause to protect the independence of the legislature. The Court declines to extend those protections further, holding that the Speech or Debate Clause does not shield Members of Congress from the execution of valid search warrants. Congressman Jefferson's interpretation of the Speech or Debate privilege would have the effect of converting every congressional office into a taxpayer-subsidized sanctuary for crime. Such a result is not supported by the Constitution or judicial precedent and will not be adopted here. See ''[[Williamson v. United States]]'', 28 S. Ct. at 167 ('[T]he laws of this country allow no place or employment as a sanctuary for crime.') (quotation omitted).<ref> {{cite web | year=2006| title= IN RE: SEARCH OF THE RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING ROOM NUMBER 2113 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515| url=http://graphics.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/20060710_RAYBURN_OPINION.pdf | accessdate=2006-07-10}}</ref>
However, later that same month, a three-judge appellate panel unanimously overruled Hogan's decision and affirmed that the Department of Justice could not review Rep. Jefferson's files until he had seen what files were taken and which of those pertained to his work as a legislator.  The appellate court directed that Hogan, the judge who originally authorized the controversial search and seizure, should determine if Jefferson's claims of legislative privilege extend to specific seized files that the lawmaker may cite. Jefferson was not charged with any crime at the close of July of 2006.<ref>{{cite news | publisher = [[New York Times]] | title = Lawmaker Wins Delay On Review Of Evidence | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/29/washington/29jefferson.html | date = [[2006-07-29]] | page = A10 | first = Philip | last = Shenon | accessdate = 2007-02-07 }}</ref>

===Stripped of committee membership===

On [[May 24]], [[Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] publicly requested his immediate resignation from the [[House Ways and Means Committee]]; he declined to do so.<ref>[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/politics/3885848.html chron.com] article.</ref> Although [[Mel Watt]], the chair of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] declared the strong support of the caucus for Jefferson it has since been reported that two prominent members of the caucus, [[John Lewis (politician)|John Lewis]] (D-Ga.) and [[Charles B. Rangel]] (D-NY) have played a major role in the campaign to force Jefferson to step down.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.milwaukeecourier.org/news/Article/Article.asp?NewsID=9044&sID=3 | title = Some CBC Members Secretly Trying to Oust Jefferson from Committee Post | first = Hazel Trice | last = Edney | publisher = Milwaukee Courier | date = [[2006-06-13]] | accessdate = 2007-02-07 }}</ref>

On [[15 June]] [[2006]], House Democrats voted to strip Jefferson of his committee assignment while the federal bribery investigation continues. Members approved the move after Jefferson repeatedly refused to step aside. Despite claims of the Congressional Black Caucus that Jefferson was being treated unfairly, the vote passed 99-58. Some have reported that the vote was passed as a result of Democrats who are determined to make an election-year point about ethics. The full House, which is the only group with the power to actually remove Jefferson, then stripped him of his seat on the committee on June 16th in a voice vote without debate. Jefferson had offered to step aside temporarily if the Democratic caucus established a rule concerning cases like his and if his seat went to Rep. [[Charlie Melancon]] (D-LA). This offer was rejected by House Democratic leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi.<ref>[[MSNBC]], [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13348896/ ''"House lawmakers strip Jefferson of panel seat"''], June 16, 2006. Retrieved Dec. 9, 2006.</ref>

== 2006 Election ==
''Main article: [[Louisiana House elections, 2006]]''

Because he is excluded from the [[House Committee on Ways and Means]], Jefferson has a significantly reduced influence in [[Washington, D.C.]] and faced an uphill battle to keep his seat in Congress, during the [[United States House elections, 2006|2006 U.S. Midterm Election]].  Eight [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democrats]], three [[Republican Party of the United States|Republicans]] and one [[Libertarian Party of the United States|Libertarian]] candidate ran against him. <ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cqpolitics.com/2006/08/bribery_claims_fail_to_keep_je.html | date=August 9, 2006 | first=Lauren | last=Phillips | title=Bribery Claims Fail to Keep Jefferson from Filing in La. 2 | publisher=CQPolitics.com }}</ref>

A significant amount of the district<U+2019>s voters were still scattered across the [[United States]] as a result of the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]].  Many of them were [[African American|Black]] and supported the Democrats.  Nonetheless, the district remained heavily [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democratic]] and Democratic candidates fared better.

None of the candidates obtained more than 50% of the vote on the [[Jungle primary|first ballot]] (November 7, 2006) and, therefore, a [[Jungle primary|second ballot]] was necessary.  The two candidates who survived the first ballot were both [[African American|Black]] [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democrats]]: Jefferson, who got 30% of the vote, and [[Louisiana State Legislature|Louisiana State Representative]] [[Karen Carter]], who enjoyed support from the Louisiana Democratic Party<U+2019>s establishment, picked up nearly all endorsements from local politicians and the local press and gathered 22% of the vote. <ref>{{cite news | title=Democratic Party in La. Backs Rival Of Jefferson | publisher=Associated Press | date=October 15, 2006 | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/14/AR2006101401267.html}}</ref>

Political commentators predicted an easy victory for [[Karen Carter]] on the [[Jungle primary|second ballot]] (to be held on December 9, 2006). <ref>{{cite news | title=Jefferson's Dilemma | publisher=Gambit Weekly | date=November 21, 2006 | url=http://www.bestofneworleans.com/dispatch/2006-11-21/politics.php}}</ref>

In the last week of campaign however, [[Sheriff]] [[Harry Lee]], a [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]] [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democrat]] who wields tremendous influence in suburban [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]], urged voters not to vote for [[Karen Carter]]. <ref>{{cite news | title=Harry Lee: Say No to Karen Carter | publisher=WWL-TV New Orleans | date=December 4, 2006 | url=http://www.wwltv.com/local/stories/wwl120406tpflyer.52f92338.html}}</ref>

In response to Carter's criticism of [[Gretna, Louisiana|Gretna]] police officers and [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]] deputies, who blocked the [[Crescent City Connection]] and prevented evacuees from fleeing the city of [[New Orleans]] in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], Lee mailed out 25,000 flyers and made public statements attacking Carter.

Lee<U+2019>s efforts to defeat Carter were successful.  [[White people|White]] voters from [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]], a group that had not shown much enthusiasm for Bill Jefferson<U+2019>s reelection on the [[Jungle primary|first ballot]], stayed home rather than vote against him.  [[Voter turnout]] dwindled from 24.15% to 16.25%.  While residents of the city of [[New Orleans]] gave Bill Jefferson a slight majority over [[Karen Carter]] (51% to 49%), the portion of the district that is located in [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]] (71% to 29%) clearly swung the election in his favor.

Following Bill Jefferson's reelection, [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker-elect]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] announced that he will be excluded from the [[House Committee on Ways and Means]] as long as he is not "cleared of wrongdoing in an ongoing federal corruption probe". <ref>{{cite news | title=Jefferson still off crucial committee | publisher=Times-Picayune | date=December 13, 2006 | url=http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/washington/index.ssf?/base/news-1/1165992007127930.xml&coll=1}}</ref>

== Nickname ==

In the wake of the corruption investigation, the New Orleans media often refers to the congressman as Dollar Bill Jefferson.  According to [[conservatism|Conservative]] political commentator [[Jeff Crouere]], he "received his unflattering nickname from the late [[Ernest Nathan Morial|Ernest <U+201C>Dutch<U+201D> Morial]]."
