The '''Laguna Madre''' is a long shallow [[hypersaline]] [[Headlands and bays|bay]] along the western coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in  [[Nueces County, Texas|Nueces]], [[Kenedy County, Texas|Kenedy]], [[Kleberg County, Texas|Kleberg]], [[Willacy County, Texas|Willacy]] and [[Cameron County, Texas|Cameron]] counties in [[Texas]], [[United States]]. It is separated by the roughly {{convert|20|mi|adj=on}} long Saltillo Flats [[land bridge]] into Upper and Lower bays. The two are joined by the [[Intracoastal Waterway]], which has been dredged through the bay. Cumulatively, Laguna Madre is approximately 130 miles (209 km) long, the length of [[Padre Island]]. The main extensions include, [[Baffin Bay, Texas|Baffin Bay]] in Upper Laguna Madre, Red Fish Bay just below the Saltillo Flats and [[South Bay (Texas)]] near the Mexican border.

The bay's ecosystem is protected by the [[Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge]], the [[Padre Island National Seashore]] as well as the privately owned [[King Ranch]]. The human history predates the formation of the Laguna Madre, and settlements have been established at [[Port Isabel, Texas|Port Isabel]] and [[Port Mansfield, Texas|Port Mansfield]] on the bay's shores.

==History==
Laguna Madre was formed about 3,000 years ago, after the stabilization of the sea level on the Texas Coast, culminating in the rise of [[Padre Island]]. The Baffin Bay extension is considerably older than Laguna Madre, and formed as a river valley during the [[Pleistocene epoch]], over 12,000 years ago. Early peoples obtained oysters from the bay, which were eliminated due to changes in salinity after the full formation of Laguna Madre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/coast/images/ap6.html|title=Baffin Bay|last=Smith|first=Suzanne|coauthors=Steve Black|work=Texas Beyond History|publisher=University of Texas|accessdate=16 June 2010}}</ref> The first people to encounter the new bay were most likely the nomadic [[Karankawa]] and [[Coahuiltecan]] Indians. The Spanish explorer [[Alonso <U+00C1>lvarez de Pineda]] is believed to be the first European to come in contact with Laguna Madre in the early 1500s, and is credited with giving it the name, which is [[Spanish Language|Spanish]] for "mother lagoon".<ref name="tpw"/>

Several land grants were handed out by the Spanish government for ranching near the bay. The first was believed to have been given to [[Jos<U+00E9> Nicol<U+00E1>s Cabazos]] in 1792, which included half a million acres (2000 km<U+00B2>) in the area south of Baffin Bay to the [[Rio Grande]]. Cabazos stocked the land with 900 cattle. American ranching settlements developed following the [[Mexican War]], including [[King Ranch]], which was established in 1847 by [[Richard King (Texas)|Richard King]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/KK/hck4.html|title=Kenedy County, Texas|last=Garza|first=Alicia A.|date=May 30, 2010|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> The area near present day [[Port Isabel, Texas|Port Isabel]] was used as a resort for Spaniards after watersellers came ashore in the late 18th Century looking for freshwater supplies. A settlement known as Point Isabel was established at the location in the 1830s, and in 1853, the [[Point Isabel Lighthouse]] was constructed to overlook the bay. The city was named Port Isabel in 1928, and in 1954, the [[Queen Isabella Causeway]], the longest bridge in Texas was constructed across Laguna Madre to [[South Padre Island]]. A newer bridge was built in 1974,<ref name="isabel"/> but part of it collapsed on September 15, 2001 after being hit by a barge, causing 8 people to plunge to their deaths and significantly hindering the economy of South Texas. It was rebuilt and reopened in November of that year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/2002_3581880/1-year-later-causeway-solution-still-debated.html|title=1 year later, causeway solution still debated|last=Brezosky|first=Lynn|date=September 15, 2002|work=Houston Chronicle|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> Port Isabel had 4,865 residents during the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]].<ref name="isabel"/> To the north, Port Mansfield was established in 1950, at the old fishing community of Red Fish Landing.

Laguna Madre is found between the mainland of South Texas and Padre Island. At this location between the [[Nueces River]] and the [[Rio Grande]], the climate is dry and it is sometimes referred to as the [[Wild Horse Desert]]. The western shore, a large part of which is included in the [[King Ranch]], is usually marked by sand dunes, [[yucca]], [[opuntia|prickly pear]], [[century plant]]s and an occasional oak tree bent by the wind.<ref name="magazine"/> The bay is split by the {{convert|20|mi|km|adj=on}} long expanse of sand flats, named the [[Saltillo Flats]], which are located approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} from the northern extreme near the [[John F. Kennedy Memorial Causeway]] in [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]]. This part of the bay is known as the Upper Laguna Madre and includes the extension of [[Baffin Bay, Texas|Baffin Bay]] near [[Kingsville, Texas|Kingsville]], and Bird Island on the eastern Padre Island shore, northeast of the opening of Baffin Bay. The Lower Laguna Madre includes the area south of the Saltillo Flats to the extension of [[South Bay (Texas)|South Bay]] near [[Port Isabel, Texas|Port Isabel]],<ref name="tpw">{{cite web|url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/fishboat/fish/didyouknow/lagunamadre.phtml|title=Laguna Madre|last=Blankinship|first=Randy|coauthors=Kyle Spiller|work=Texas Parks and Wildlife|publisher=Texas Parks and Wildlife Department|accessdate=5 June 2010}}</ref> and is crossed by the [[Queen Isabella Causeway]].<ref name="isabel">{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/PP/hgp9.html|title=Port Isabel, Texas|last=Garza|first=Alicia A.|date=May 30, 2010|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref> Included in the Lower Laguna Madre is [[Red Fish Bay]], which is found along the shoreline of the King Ranch, south to [[Port Mansfield, Texas|Port Mansfield]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/RR/rrr1.html|title=Red Fish Bay|date=May 30, 2010|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=14 June 2010}}</ref>

The bay is shallow and narrow, averaging only {{convert|3.6|ft|m}} in depth and {{convert|4|mi|km}} to {{convert|6|mi|km}} in width. The depth is only {{convert|0.66|ft|cm}} to {{convert|1.1|ft|cm}} in the areas not dredged to form the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep, {{convert|138|ft|m|adj=on}} wide [[Intracoastal Waterway|Gulf Intracoastal Waterway]], which runs the bay's length<ref name="gulf">{{cite web|url=http://www.gulfbase.org/bay/view.php?bid=laguna|title=Laguna Madre|work=GulfBase|publisher=Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies|accessdate=5 June 2010}}</ref> and joins the upper and lower stretches.<ref name="tpw"/> Two types of hard reef are found in the bay bed and on the shoreline, including beach rock reefs (shell and sand bound by [[calcium carbonate]] cement) common south of Baffin Bay due to the occasional shifts in the Laguna Madre coastal shoreline; and [[Serpulid]] reefs, common in Baffin Bay, and elsewhere in the system, formed between 300 and 3,000 years ago by the annelid's calcareous tubes.<ref name="tpw"/> 

Laguna Madre has a salinity of 36 [[Parts-per notation|parts per thousand]] (ppt),<ref name="gulf"/> which is above the seawater average of 35 ppt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marinebio.net/marinescience/02ocean/swcomposition.htm|title=Seawater Composition|last=Anderson|first=Genny|date=October 8, 2008|work=Marine Science|accessdate=9 January 2010}}</ref> Because of the high salinity, it holds the distinction as one of the Earth's six [[hypersaline]] bays, the others being [[Sivash]] in [[Ukraine]], [[Laguna Ojo de Liebre]] on the west coast of [[Baja California]], [[Spencer Gulf]] and [[Shark Bay]] in [[Australia]], and the [[Laguna Madre (Mexico)|Laguna Madre of Tamaulipas]], which is sometimes grouped with the Laguna Madre of Texas as one system.<ref name="Frank W. JuddBartlett2002">{{cite book|last1=Frank W. Judd|first1=Richard C.|last2=Bartlett|first2=Richard D.|last3=John W.|first3=Jr Campbell|title=The Laguna Madre of Texas and Tamaulipas (Gulf Coast Studies Series, 2)|accessdate=12 June 2010|year=2002|publisher=Texas A&amp;amp;M University Press|location=College Station|isbn=1-58544-133-3}}</ref> The reasons for its hypersalinity include shallowness, the lack of a significant river source, dry climate, high evaporation and the isolation from other bodies of water. Its salinity was even greater before the Port Mansfield Gulf Channel was dredged on Padre Island, which allowed a larger amount of seawater exchange. However, very little water exchange occurs at all,<ref name="magazine">{{cite web|url=http://www.tpwmagazine.com/archive/2008/jul/ed_2/|title=The Big Laguna|last=Patoski|first=Joe Nick|date=July 2008|work=Texas Parks and Wildlife Magazine|publisher=Texas Parks and Wildlife Department|accessdate=5 June 2010}}</ref> every second only {{convert|25|m3|gal}} of water flows into the bay.<ref name="gulf"/> Rainwater from tropical storms and hurricanes is the only significant fresh water the bay receives. The salinity is greatest in the Lower Laguna Madre where it averages around 45 ppt.<ref name="magazine"/>

==Ecosystem==
The Laguna Madre is the one of the most important and unspoiled bay ecosystems in Texas.<ref name="magazine"/> It is also one of the most protected in the United States; 75% of its shores are protected by the [[Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge]] to the west and the [[Padre Island National Seashore]] on the east.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stxmaps.com/go/laguna-madre.html|title=Laguna Madre|year=2010|work=The South Texas Map|publisher=Texmaps and Carson Map Company, Inc|accessdate=5 June 2010}}</ref> Fish, shrimp and crab, which feed the bird populations, depend on the bay and its plentiful beds of [[seagrass]] for survival. The seagrass of Laguna Madre, accounts for 80% of all seagrass found off the Texas Coast, however, it is threatened by [[Algal bloom|brown tides]] caused by poor circulation and dredging. An influx of seawater can sometimes replace the vital seagrass with oyster beds.<ref name="magazine"/>

Laguna Madre is home to more finfish than anywhere else on the Texas coast,<ref name="magazine"/> with such species as the [[Great Barracuda]], [[Blue catfish]], [[Hardhead catfish]], [[Atlantic croaker]], [[Dolphin fish]], [[Black drum]], [[Red drum]], [[Southern flounder]], [[Alligator gar]], [[Houndfish]], [[Crevalle Jack]], [[Southern kingfish]], [[Ladyfish]], [[Midshipman fish|Atlantic midshipman]], [[Mojarras]], [[Striped Mullet]], [[Pinfish]], [[Florida Pompano]], [[Smooth butterfly ray]], [[Spotted Seatrout]], [[Blacktip Shark]], [[Sheepshead]], [[Eleotridae|Bigmouth sleeper]], [[Gray snapper]], [[Common Snook]], [[Southern Stargazer]], [[Southern stingray]] and [[Tripletail]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/fishboat/fish/action/waterecords.php?WB_code=8230|title=Water Body Records for Lower Laguna Madre|date=June 3, 2010|work=Texas Parks and Wildlife|publisher=Texas Parks and Wildlife Department|accessdate=8 June 2010}}</ref> Many fowl migrate and live around the bay including 75% of all [[Redhead (duck)|Redhead]] ducks. Other birds in the area include the [[Peregrine Falcon]], [[Piping Plover]], [[Roseate Spoonbill]], [[Long-billed Curlew]], [[crane (bird)|crane]], [[egret]] and the [[Brown Pelican]]. [[Sea turtles]], [[dolphin]]s and [[alligator]]s can be found in the bay, while cattle, [[White-tailed Deer]], [[Nilgai]] and [[Bobcat]]s can sometimes be seen near the shore.<ref name="magazine"/>

==Industry==
Ranching and agriculture is predominate near King Ranch, however, the ports of Port Isabel and Port Mansfield rely on the fishing and [[Shrimp fishery|shrimping]] industries. In the 1960s, Port Isabel averaged an output of 4 million tons (3.6 million tonnes) of shrimp annually, which accounted for 65% of the entire production in Texas.<ref name="isabel"/> In Port Mansfield, the fishing industry has greatly expanded with the opening of the Port Mansfield Channel, allowing a steady accumulation of red fish, [[brown shrimp]], and flounder.<ref name="Mansfield"/> Because of the bay's environmental protections, very few manufacturing plants have been constructed in the area. Following an environmental campaign, the [[Valero Energy Corporation]] constructed an [[Pipeline transport|oil and gas pipeline]] from Corpus Christi to the [[Rio Grande Valley]] to decrease the shipment of oil and gas along the Intracoastal Waterway, greatly diminishing the chance of a spill. [[Environmentalism|Activists]] have likewise railed against a proposed [[wind turbine]] farm off Baffin Bay, due to the potential harm to the scenic shores and the bird populations.<ref name="magazine"/>

The [[tourism]] industry is also a mainstay for communities on the bay. Beach-goers must pass the Laguna Madre to reach the prime beaching destination at both North and South Padre Island. Fishing has drawn tourists to Port Isabel, where the first [[Texas International Fishing Tournament]] was held in 1934.<ref name="isabel"/> Visitors also flock to Bird Island off the western coast of Padre Island, for windsurfing, kayaking, and other water sports.<ref name="magazine"/>
