The '''Ring-tailed Lemur''' (''Lemur catta'') is a large [[Strepsirrhini|Strepsirhine]] [[primate]] and the most recognized [[lemur]] due to its long, black and white ringed tail. It belongs to [[Lemuridae]], one of four lemur families. It is the only member of the '''''Lemur''''' [[genus]]. Like all lemurs it is found only on the island of [[Madagascar]]. Known locally as '''Hira''' ([[Malagasy language|Malagasy]]) or '''Maki''' ([[French language|French]] and Malagasy),<ref name="Mittermeier246">Mittermeier, p. 246</ref> it inhabits [[gallery forest]]s to spiny [[scrubland|scrub]] in the southern regions of the island. It is [[Omnivore|omnivorous]] and the most [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] of lemurs. The animal is [[Diurnality|diurnal]], being active exclusively in daylight hours.

The Ring-tailed Lemur is highly social, living in groups of up to 30 individuals.  It is also [[matriarchy|matriarchal]], a trait common among lemurs but uncommon among other primates.  To keep warm and reaffirm social bonds groups will huddle together forming a ''lemur ball''. The Ring-tailed Lemur will also sunbathe, sitting upright facing its underside, with its thinner white fur, towards the sun. Like other lemurs, this species relies strongly on its sense of smell and marks its territory with scent glands.  The males perform a unique [[Territorial marking|scent marking]] behaviour called ''spur marking'' and will participate in ''stink fights'' by impregnating their tail with their scent and wafting it at opponents.

As one of the most vocal primates, the Ring-tailed Lemur utilizes numerous [[Calls of the Ring-tailed Lemur|vocalizations]] including group cohesion and [[alarm signal|alarm calls]].<ref name="DukeLemurCenter">{{cite web |title = Ringtailed Lemur |publisher=Duke Lemur Center |url=http://lemur.duke.edu/animals/ringtailed/print.php |accessdate=2008-08-30}}</ref>  Despite the lack of a large brain (relative to [[Simian|Simiiform]] primates) experiments have shown that the Ring-tailed Lemur can organize sequences,<ref name="Merritt">{{cite journal | first = Dustin | last = Merritt | coauthors = et al. | title = A Comparative Analysis of Serial Ordering in Ring-Tailed Lemurs (Lemur catta) | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 121 | issue = 4 | year = 2007 | pages = 363<U+2013>371 | url = http://www.duke.edu/web/mind/level2/faculty/liz/Publications/Merritt,%20MacLean,%20Jaffe%20and%20Brannon%20(2007).pdf | format = PDF Reprint | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.121.4.363}}</ref> understand basic [[arithmetic operation]]s<ref name="Santos1">{{cite journal | first = Laurie R. | last = Santos | coauthors = Barnes, Jennifer L., and Mahajan, Neha | title = Expectations about numerical events in four lemur species (Eulemur fulvus, Eulemur mongoz, Lemur catta and Varecia rubra) | journal = Animal Cognition | volume = 8 | year = 2005 | pages = 253<U+2013>262 | url = http://www.yale.edu/caplab/Main/Publications_files/santosetal.lemurnumber.pdf | format = PDF Reprint | doi = 10.1007/s10071-005-0252-4}}</ref> and preferentially select tools based on functional qualities.<ref name="Santos2">{{cite journal | first = Laurie R. | last = Santos | coauthors = Mahajan, Neha, and Barens, Jennifer L. | title = How Prosimian Primates Represent Tools: Experiments With Two Lemur Species (Eulemur fulvus and Lemur catta) | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 119 | year = 2005 | issue = 4 | pages = 394<U+2013>403 | url = http://www.yale.edu/caplab/Main/Publications_files/santosetal.lemurtools.jcp.pdf | format = PDF Reprint | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.119.4.394}}</ref>

==Etymology==

The term ''lemur'' was selected by early biologists because the calls of some elusive lemur species brought to mind the cries of the spirits of the dead, or [[larvae|lemures]], from  [[Roman mythology]].<ref name="Garbutt85-86">Garbutt, pp. 85&ndash;86</ref>  The species name, ''catta'', comes from the similarity between the Ring-tailed Lemur's [[Ring-tailed Lemur#Auditory communication|purring vocalization]] and that of the [[cat|Domestic Cat]].<ref name="SDZooFactSheet" />

==Evolutionary history==

All [[mammal]]ian [[fossil]]s from Madagascar come from recent times.<ref name="Mittermeier23-26">Mittermeier, p. 23&ndash;26</ref>  Thus, little is known about the evolution of the Ring-tailed Lemur, let alone the [[infraorder|order]] [[Lemuriformes]], which comprises the entire [[endemism|endemic]] primate population of the island.  However, [[chromosome|chromosomal]] and [[Molecular clock|molecular]] evidence suggest that lemurs are more closely related to each other than to other [[Strepsirrhini|Strepsirrhine]] primates.  For this to have happened, it is thought that a very small ancestral population came to Madagascar via a single [[rafting event]] between 50 and 80&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name="Garbutt85-86" /><ref name="Mittermeier23-26" /><ref name="Horvath">{{cite journal | title = Development and Application of a Phylogenomic Toolkit: Resolving the Evolutionary History of Madagascar's Lemurs | journal = Genome Research | volume = 18 | pages = 490 | year = 2008 | author = Horvath, J. ''et al.'' | url = http://www.biology.duke.edu/wraylab/papers/Horvath&al_2008.pdf | accessdate = 2008-08-22 | format = PDF}}</ref> Subsequent [[evolutionary radiation]] and [[speciation]] has created the diversity of Malagasy lemurs seen today.  The Ring-tailed Lemur itself is thought to share closer affinities than the rest of its subfamily, [[Lemurinae]], to the [[bamboo lemur]]s of the genus ''Hapalemur'',<ref name="Garbutt146-148">Garbutt, p. 146&ndash;148</ref><ref name="Mittermeier237">Mittermeier, p. 237</ref> which may be a [[cladistics|sister group]] of the family Lemuridae.<ref name="Groves4">{{cite journal | last=Groves | first=Colin P. | coauthors=Trueman, John W.

===Taxonomic classification===

The genus ''Lemur'' contains only one species, the Ring-tailed Lemur.

* '''Family [[Lemuridae]]'''
** '''Subfamily [[Lemurinae]]'''
*** '''Genus ''Lemur''''': the Ring-tailed Lemur
*** Genus ''[[true lemur|Eulemur]]'': brown lemurs
*** Genus ''[[ruffed lemur|Varecia]]'': ruffed lemurs
** Subfamily [[Hapalemurinae]]: bamboo lemurs
*** Genus ''[[bamboo lemur|Hapalemur]]'': lesser gentle or bamboo lemurs
*** Genus ''[[Greater Bamboo Lemur|Prolemur]]'': the Greater Bamboo Lemur

====Changes in taxonomy====

The Ring-tailed Lemur shares many similarities with the members of its subfamily, Lemurinae, and its skeleton is nearly indistinguishable from that of the brown lemurs.<ref name="Garbutt146-148" />  For these reasons, the Ring-tailed Lemur, [[true lemur|brown lemur]]s and [[ruffed lemur]]s were once grouped together in the genus ''Lemur''.  However, ruffed lemurs were reassigned to the genus ''Varecia'' in 1962,<ref name="msw3" /> and due to similarities between the Ring-tailed Lemur and the bamboo lemurs, particularly in regards to molecular evidence and scent glands similarities, the brown lemurs were moved to the genus ''Eulemur'' in 1988.<ref name="msw3" /><ref name="Garbutt146-148" /><ref name="Mittermeier237" /> The genus ''Lemur'' is now [[monotypic]], containing only the Ring-tailed Lemur. Although not all authorities agree, the majority of the [[primatology|primatological community]] currently favors this classification.<ref name="msw3" /><ref name="Mittermeier237" />

==Anatomy and physiology==
[[Image:Ringtailed lemur tail.jpg|thumb|left|The Ring-tailed Lemur's tail is longer than its body.]]

An adult Ring-tailed Lemur may reach a body length between {{convert|39|and|46|cm|in|lk=on|abbr=on}} and a weight between {{convert|2.3|and|3.5|kg|lb|lk=on|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Mittermeier246-249">Mittermeier, pp. 246&ndash;249</ref>  The species has a slender frame and narrow face, reminiscent of a [[fox|vulpine]] muzzle. Like all lemurs, its hind limbs are longer than its forelimbs. Females have two pairs of [[mammary gland]]s, but only one pair is functional.<ref name="SDZooFactSheet" />

Furless [[scent gland]]s are present on both males and females. Both genders have [[apocrine]] and [[sebaceous]] glands in their genital regions,<ref name="ChemicalComp">{{cite journal |author=Scordato, E.S., Dubay, G., and Drea, C.M. |year=2007 |title=Chemical Composition of Scent Marks in the Ringtailed Lemur (Lemur catta): Glandular Differences, Seasonal Variation, and Individual Signatures |journal=Chemical Senses |volume=32 |pages=493&ndash;504 |doi=10.1093/chemse/bjm018}}</ref> as well as [[scent gland|antebrachial gland]]s located on the inner surface of the forearm in proximity of the wrist. However, only the male has a horny spur that overlays this scent gland.  The males also have [[scent gland|brachial gland]]s on the [[axilla]]ry surface of their shoulders.<ref name="SDZooFactSheet" />

The Ring-tailed Lemur's trademark, a long, bushy tail, is ringed in alternating black and white transverse stripes, numbering 13 to 15 each for both colors, and always ending in a black tip.<ref name="SDZooFactSheet" /><ref name="Garbutt146-148" /><ref name="Mittermeier246-249" /> Its tail is longer than its body, measuring up to {{cm to in|64|abbr=yes}} in length.<ref name="Mittermeier246-249" /> The tail is not [[prehensile tail|prehensile]] and is only used for balance, communication, and group cohesion.<ref name="DukeLemurCenter" />

The [[pelage]], or fur, is dense. The [[Anatomical terms of location|ventral]] (chest) coat and throat are white or cream, and the [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsal]] (back) coat is gray to rosy-brown. The crown is dark gray, while the ears and cheeks are white. The muzzle is dark grayish and the nose is black, and the eyes are encompassed by black [[lozenge]]-shaped patches.<ref name="Mittermeier246-249" />

The black skin is visible on the nose, genitalia, and the palms and soles of the limbs. The Ring-tailed Lemur shares several adaptations with other lemurs.  Its fingers are slender, padded, and semi-dexterous with flat, human-like [[finger nail|nails]]. It grooms orally by licking and tooth-scraping with narrow, procumbent lower incisors and canines, called a [[toothcomb]]. Lastly, it has a [[toilet-claw]] (sometimes referred to as a ''grooming claw'') on the second toe of each hind limb specialized for [[personal grooming]], specifically to rake through fur that is unreachable by the mouth and toothcomb.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lemur Basics|url=http://www.lemurs.us/basics.html|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>

The species' eyes can be a bright yellow or orange. Unlike most diurnal primates, but like all strepsirhine primates, the Ring-tailed Lemur has a [[tapetum lucidum]], or reflective layer behind the [[retina]] of the eye, that enhances [[night vision]].<ref name="SDZooFactSheet" />

==Ecology==
The Ring-tailed Lemur is [[Diurnality|diurnal]] and semi-terrestrial. It is the most terrestrial of lemur species, spending as much as 33% of its time on the ground. However it is still considerably [[arboreal]], spending 23% of its time in the mid-level [[canopy (forest)|canopy]], 25% in the upper-level canopy, 6% in the emergent layer and 13% in small bushes. Troop travel is 70% terrestrial.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet">{{cite web | last = Cawthon Lang | first = KA | date = 2005-09-21 | title = Primate Factsheets: Ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) Taxonomy, Morphology, and Ecology |publisher = Wisconsin Primate Research Center (WPRC) | url = http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/ring-tailed_lemur | accessdate = 2008-09-23}}</ref>

Troop size, home range, and population density vary by region and food availability. Troops typically range in size from 6 to 25, although troops with over 30&nbsp;individuals have been recorded.<ref name="Garbutt146-148" /> The average troop contains 13 to 15&nbsp;individuals.<ref name="Garbutt146-148" /> Home range sizes varies between {{convert|6|and|35|ha|acre|abbr=off|lk=on}}.<ref name="Perspective1">{{cite book | author = Gould, L. | coauthors = Sauther, M. | title = Primates in Perspective | chapter = Lemuriformes | editor = Campbell, C., Fuentes, A., MacKinnon, K., Panger, M., and Bearder, S. | year = 2007 | page = 53| isbn = 978-0-19-517133-4}}</ref> Troops of the Ring-tailed Lemur will maintain a territory, but overlap is often high. When encounters occur, they are [[Agonistic behaviour|agonistic]], or hostile in nature. A troop will usually occupy the same part of its range for three or four days before moving. When it does move, the average traveling distance is {{convert|1|km|mi|2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet" /> [[Population density]] ranges from 100&nbsp;individuals per {{convert|1|km2|sqmi|2|abbr=on}} in dry forests to 250<U+2013>600&nbsp;individuals per km<sup>2</sup> in [[gallery forest|gallery]] and secondary forests.<ref name="Mittermeier246-249" />

The Ring-tailed Lemur has both native and [[introduced species|introduced]] predators. Native predators include the [[Fossa (animal)|Fossa]] (''Cryptoprocta ferox''), the [[Madagascar Harrier-hawk]] (''Polyboroides radiatus''), the [[Madagascar Buzzard]] (''Buteo brachypterus'') and the [[Boa madagascariensis|Madagascar Ground Boa]] (''Boa madagascariensis'').<ref name="Mittermeier246-249" /> Introduced predators include the [[Small Indian Civet]] (''Viverricula indica''), the [[Domestic Cat]] and the [[Domestic Dog]].<ref name="Mittermeier246-249" />

===Geographic range and habitat===
[[Image:Lemur catta 1.jpg|thumb|right|Ring-tailed Lemurs at [[Isalo National Park]] in Madagascar.]]

[[Endemism|Endemic]] to southern and southwestern [[Madagascar]], the Ring-tailed Lemur ranges further into highland areas than other lemurs.  It inhabits [[deciduous forest]]s, dry scrub, [[montane]] humid forests, and gallery forests (forests along riverbanks). It strongly favors gallery forests, but such forests have now been cleared from much of Madagascar in order to create pasture for livestock.<ref name="Mittermeier246-249" /> Depending on location, temperatures within its geographic range can vary between {{Convert|-7|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} and {{Convert|48|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet" />

This species is found as far east as [[T<U+00F4>lanaro]], north to [[Belo sur Tsiribihina]], along the west coast and inland towards the mountains of [[Andringitra National Park|Andringitra]] on the southeastern plateau. It can be seen in the [[Berenty Reserve]], [[Andohahela National Park]], [[Isalo National Park]] and [[Zombitse-Vohibasia National Park]].<ref name="Mittermeier246-249" />

===Sympatric relations===

The following lemur species are [[Sympatric speciation|sympatric]] with the Ring-tailed Lemur, meaning they are related species found within its geographic range:<ref name="PrimateInfoNet" />

* [[Verreaux's Sifaka]] (''Propithecus verreauxi'')
* [[Red-tailed Sportive Lemur]] (''Lepilemur ruficaudatus'')
* [[White-footed Sportive Lemur]] (''Lepilemur leucopus'')
* [[Red-fronted Brown Lemur]] (''Eulemur rufus'')
* [[Greater Dwarf Lemur]] (''Cheirogaleus major'')
* [[Fat-tailed Dwarf Lemur]] (''Cheirogaleus medius'')
* [[Aye-aye]] (''Daubentonia madagascariensis'')
* [[Eastern Lesser Bamboo Lemur]] (''Hapalemur griseus'')

In Western Madagascar, sympatric Ring-tailed Lemurs and [[Red-fronted Brown Lemur]]s have been studied together. Little interaction takes place between the two species. The Ring-tailed Lemur spends more time on the ground than the Red-fronted Brown Lemur. While the diets of the two species overlap, they eat in different proportions since the Ring-tailed Lemur has a more varied diet.<ref name="Sussman">{{cite book | first = Robert W. | last = Sussman | title = Primate Ecology and Social Structure | volume = Volume 1: Lorises, Lemurs and Tarsiers | page = 154&ndash;173 | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-536-02256-9}}</ref>

==Behaviour==
===Diet===
The Ring-tailed Lemur is an opportunistic [[omnivore]] primarily eating fruits and leaves, particularly those of the [[tamarind|tamarind tree (''Tamarindus indica'')]], known natively as ''kily''.<ref name="Mittermeier246-249" /><ref name="Sussman" /> When available tamarind makes up as much as 50% of the diet, especially during the dry, winter season.<ref name="Mittermeier246-249" /> The Ring-tailed Lemur eats from as many as three dozen different plant species, and its diet includes flowers, herbs, bark and sap. It has been observed eating decayed wood, [[geophagy|earth]], spider webs, insect cocoons, [[arthropod]]s (spiders, caterpillars, cicadas and grasshoppers) and small [[vertebrate]]s (birds and chameleons).<ref name="Mittermeier246-249" /> During the dry season it becomes increasingly opportunistic.

===Social systems===
Troops are classified as multi-male/multi-female, with a [[matriline]] as the core group.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet2" /> As with most lemurs, females socially dominate males in all circumstances, including feeding priority. Dominance is enforced by lunging, chasing, cuffing, grabbing and biting. Young females do not inherit their mother's rank and young males leave the troop between three and five years of age.<ref name="Sussman" /><ref name="PrimateInfoNet2" />  Both sexes have separate dominance hierarchies; females have a distinct hierarchy while male rank is correlated with age. Each troop has one to three central, high-ranking adult males who interact with females more than other group males and lead the troop procession with high-ranking females.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet2" /> Recently transferred males, old males or young adult males that have not yet left their natal group are often lower ranking. Staying at the periphery of the group they tend to be marginalized from group activity.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet2" />

For males, social structure changes can be seasonal. During the six month period between December and May a few males immigrate between groups. Established males transfer every 3.5&nbsp;years,<ref name="Sussman" /> although young males may transfer every 1.4&nbsp;years. Group fission occurs when groups get too large and resources become scarce.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet2" />

[[Image:Lemurs sunning.jpg|thumb|left|Ring-tailed Lemurs sunning]]
In the mornings the Ring-tailed Lemur sunbathes to warm itself. It faces the sun sitting in what is frequently described as a "sun-worshipping" posture or [[Lotus position]]. However, it sits with its legs extended outward, not cross-legged, and will often support itself on nearby branches. Sunning is often a group activity, particularly during the cold mornings. At night, troops will split into sleeping parties huddling closely together to keep warm.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet2" /> A group of huddled Ring-tailed Lemurs is referred to as a ''lemur ball''.

Despite being [[quadruped]]al the Ring-tailed Lemur can rear up and balance on its hind legs, usually for aggressive displays. When threatened the Ring-tailed Lemur may jump in the air and strike out with its short nails and sharp upper [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]] in a behaviour termed ''jump fighting''.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet2" /> This is extremely rare outside of the breeding season when tensions are high and competition for mates is intense. Other aggressive behaviours include a ''threat-stare'', used to intimidate or start a fight, and a submissive gesture known as ''pulled-back lips''.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet2" />

Border disputes with rival troops occur occasionally and it is the dominant female's responsibility to defend the troop's home range. Agonistic encounters include staring, lunging approaches and occasional physical aggression, and conclude with troop members retreating toward the center of the home range.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet2" />

====Olfactory communication====
[[Image:Lemur catta handstand.jpg|thumb|Ring-tailed Lemur scent-marking using anogenital scent glands]]
[[Olfaction|Olfactory]] communication is critically important for [[prosimian]]s like the Ring-tailed Lemur. Males and females [[territorial marking|scent mark]] both vertical and horizontal surfaces at the overlaps in their home ranges using their [[scent gland|anogenital scent gland]]s. The Ring-tailed Lemur will perform a handstand to mark vertical surfaces, grasping the highest point with its feet while it applies its scent.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet2">{{cite web | last = Cawthon Lang | first = KA | date = 2005-09-21 | title = Primate Factsheets: Ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) Behavior |publisher = Wisconsin Primate Research Center (WPRC) | url = http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/ring-tailed_lemur/behav | accessdate = 2008-09-23}}</ref> Use of scent marking varies by age, sex and social status.<ref name="Perspective2">{{cite book | author = Gouzoules, H. | coauthors = Gouzoules, S. | title = Primates in Perspective | chapter = The Conundrum of Communication | editor = Campbell, C., Fuentes, A., MacKinnon, K., Panger, M., and Bearder, S. | year = 2007 | page = 624 | isbn = 978-0-19-517133-4}}</ref> Male lemurs use their antebrachial and brachial glands to demarcate territories and maintain intragroup dominance hierarchies. The thorny spur that overlays the antebrachial gland on each wrist is scraped against tree trunks to create grooves anointed with their scent. This is known as ''spur-marking''.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet2" />

In displays of aggression, males engage in a social display behaviour called ''stink fighting'', which involves impregnating their tails with secretions from the antebrachial and brachial glands and waving the scented tail at male rivals.<ref name="pic">{{cite book | title = The Pictorial Guide to the Living Primates | author = Rowe, N. | year = 1996 | page = 38 | isbn = 0-9648825-0-7}}</ref> During the mating season, males wave their scented tails at females as a form of sexual overture; this usually results in the female cuffing or biting the male and elicits subordinate vocalizations from the would-be paramour.

====Auditory communication====
{{main|Calls of the Ring-tailed Lemur}}

{{Inline audio}}

The Ring-tailed Lemur is one of the most vocal primates and has a complex array of distinct [[animal communication|vocalizations]] used to maintain group cohesion during foraging and alert group members to the presence of a predator.  Calls range from simple to copmlex.  An example of a simple call is the purr {{Audio2|Lemur_catta--purr1.ogg}}, which expresses contentment.  A complex call is the sequence of clicks, close-mouth click series (CMCS), open-mouth click series (OMCS) and yaps {{Audio2|Lemur_catta--click_series_&_yaps.ogg}} used during [[mobbing behavior|predator mobbing]].<ref name="JM_Macedonia">{{cite journal |last = Macedonia |first = Joseph M. |date = 1993 |title = The Vocal Repertoire of the Ringtailed Lemur (''Lemur catta'') |journal = Folia Primatologica |volume = 61 |pages = 186&ndash;217}}</ref>  Some calls have variants and undergo transitions between variants, such as an infant "whit" (distress call) transitioning from one variant to another {{Audio2|Lemur_catta--infant_whits_transition_var1-var2.ogg}}.<ref name="JM_Macedonia" />

The most commonly heard vocalizations are the moan {{Audio2|Lemur_catta--moan1.ogg}} (low-to-moderate arousal, group cohesion), early-high wail {{Audio2|Lemur_catta--early-high_wails1.ogg}} (moderate-to-high arousal, group cohesion), and clicks {{Audio2|Lemur_catta--clicks1.ogg}} ("location marker" to draw attention).<ref name="JM_Macedonia" />

===Breeding and reproduction===
The Ring-tailed Lemur is [[polygyny|polygynous]], although the dominant male in the troop typically breeds with more females than other males. Fighting is most common during the breeding season.<ref name="AnimalDiversity">{{cite web |last = Anderson |first = R |date = 1999 |title = Lemur catta |publisher = Animal Diversity Web |url = http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Lemur_catta.html |accessdate = 2008-04-18}}</ref> A receptive female may initiate mating by presenting her backside, lifting her tail and looking at the desired male over her shoulder. Males may inspect the female's genitals to determine receptiveness. Females typically mate within their troop, but may seek outside males.<ref name="Sussman" />

[[Image:Ring tailed lemur and twins.jpg|left|thumb|A female nursing new-born twins]]

===Cognitive abilities and tool use===

Historically, the studies of [[learning]] and [[cognition]] in non-human primates have focused on [[simian]]s (monkeys and apes), while strepsirrhine primates, such as the Ring-tailed Lemur and its allies, have been overlooked and popularly dismissed as unintelligent.<ref name="Ehrlich">{{cite journal | author = Ehrlich, E | coauthors = Fobes, JL and King, JE | title = Prosimian learning capacities | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | volume = 5 | year = 1976 | pages = 599&ndash;617}}</ref> A couple factors stemming from early experiments have played a role in the development of this assumption. First, the [[design of experiments|experimental design]] of older tests may have favored the natural behavior and ecology of simians over that of strepsirrhines, making the experimental tasks inappropriate for lemurs. For example, simians are known for their manipulative play with non-food objects, whereas lemurs are only known to manipulate non-food objects in captivity.<ref name="Jolly1">{{cite journal | first = Alison | last = Jolly | authorlink = Alison Jolly | title = Prosimians' manipulation of simple object problems | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 12 | year = 1964 | issue = 4 | pages = 560&ndash;570 | doi = 10.1016/0003-3472(64)90080-6}}</ref>  This behaviour is usually connected with food association. Also, lemurs are known to displace objects with their nose or mouth more so than with their hands.<ref name="Ehrlich" />  Therefore, an experiment requiring a lemur to manipulate an object without prior training would favor simians over strepsirrhines. Second, individual Ring-tailed Lemurs accustomed to living in a troop may not respond well to isolation for laboratory testing. Past studies have reported hysterical behaviour in such scenarios.<ref name="Hosey">{{cite journal | first = Geoffrey R. | last = Hosey | title = A glimpse into the lemur mind | journal = Proceedings of the 2nd Annual Symposium on Zoo Research | date = August 2000 | pages = 5&ndash;10 | url = http://www.biaza.org.uk/resources/library/images/ARSP2.pdf#page=11 | format = PDF}}</ref> As a result of these early studies lemurs were often omitted from further research.

The notion that lemurs are unintelligent has been perpetuated by the view that the [[neocortex#neocortex ratio|neocortex ratio]] (as a measure of brain size) indicates intelligence.<ref name="Dunbar">{{cite journal | author = Dunbar, RIM | authorlink = Robin Dunbar | title = The Social Brain Hypothesis | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 6 | year = 1998 | issue = 4 | pages = 178&ndash;190 | url = http://www.liv.ac.uk/evolpsyc/Evol_Anthrop_6.pdf | format=PDF}}</ref> In fact, [[primatology|primatologist]] [[Alison Jolly]] noted early in her academic career that some lemur species, such as the Ring-tailed Lemur, have evolved a social complexity similar to that of [[Cercopithecinae|cercopithecine]] monkeys, but not the corresponding intelligence.<ref name="Jolly2">{{cite journal | first = Alison | last = Jolly | authorlink = Alison Jolly | title = Lemur Social Behavior and Primate Intelligence | journal = Science | volume = 153 | year = 1966 | issue = 3735 | pages = 501&ndash;506 | doi = 10.1126/science.153.3735.501}}</ref> After years of observations of wild Ring-tailed Lemur populations at the [[Berenty Reserve]] in Madagascar and as well as baboons in Africa, she more recently concluded that this highly social lemur species does not demonstrate the equivalent social complexity of cercopithecine monkeys, despite general appearances.<ref name="Jolly3">{{cite journal | first = Alison | last = Jolly | authorlink = Alison Jolly | title = Pair-Bonding, Female Aggression and the Evolution of Lemur Societies | journal = Folia Primatologica | volume = 69 (Suppl. 1) | year = 1998 | pages = 1&ndash;13 | doi = 10.1159/000052693}}</ref>

Regardless, research has continued to illuminate the complexity of the lemur mind, with emphasis on the cognitive abilities of the Ring-tailed Lemur. As early as the mid-1970s, studies had demonstrated that they could be trained through [[operant conditioning]] using standard [[reinforcement#schedules of reinforcement|schedules of reinforcement]].<ref name="Ehrlich" /> The species has been shown to be capable of learning pattern, brightness and object discrimination, skills common among [[vertebrate]]s.<ref name="Ehrlich" /> The Ring-tailed Lemur has also been shown to learn a variety of complex tasks often equaling, if not exceeding, the performance of simians.<ref name="Ehrlich" />

More recently, research at the [[Duke Lemur Center]] has shown that the Ring-tailed Lemur can organize sequences in memory and retrieve ordered sequences without language.<ref name="Merritt" /> The experimental design demonstrated that the lemurs were using internal representation of the sequence to guide their responses and not simply following a trained sequence, where one item in the sequence cues the selection of the next.<ref name="Merritt" /> But this is not the limit of the Ring-tailed Lemur's reasoning skills. Another study, performed at the [[Lemur Conservation Foundation#Myakka City Lemur Reserve|Myakka City Lemur Reserve]], suggests that this species along with several other closely related lemur species understand simple arithmetic operations.<ref name="Santos1" />

Since tool use is considered to be a key feature of primate intelligence, the apparent lack of this behavior in wild lemurs, as well as the lack of non-food object play, has helped reinforce the perception that lemurs are less intelligent than their simian cousins.<ref name="Jolly1" /> However, another study at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve examined the representation of tool functionality in both the Ring-tailed Lemur and the [[Common Brown Lemur]] and discovered that, like monkeys, they utilized tools with functional properties (e.g., tool orientation or ease of use) instead of tools with nonfunctional features (e.g., color or texture).<ref name="Santos2" /> Although the Ring-tailed Lemur may not use tools in the wild, it can not only be trained to use a tool, but will preferentially select tools based on their functional qualities. Therefore, the conceptual competence to utilize a tool may have been present in the common primate ancestor, even though the use of tools may not have appeared until much later.

==Conservation status==

In addition to being listed as ''Near Threatened'' in 2008 by the IUCN,<ref name="iucn" /> the Ring-tailed Lemur has been listed since 1977 by [[CITES]] under [[CITES#Appendix I|Appendix I]],<ref name="CITES">{{cite web | title = Species Gallery: Ring-tailed lemur | publisher = Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) | url = http://www.cites.org/gallery/species/mammal/ringtailedlemur.html | accessdate = 2008-10-16}}</ref> which makes trade of wild-caught specimens illegal. Although there are more endangered species of lemur, the Ring-tailed Lemur is considered a [[flagship species]] due to its recognizability.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet3">{{cite web | last = Cawthon Lang | first = KA | date = 2005-09-21 | title = Primate Factsheets: Ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) Conservation | publisher = Wisconsin Primate Research Center (WPRC) | url = http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/ring-tailed_lemur/cons | accessdate = 2008-09-23}}</ref>

Three factors threaten Ring-tailed Lemurs. First and foremost is [[habitat destruction]].  Starting nearly 2,000&nbsp;years ago with the introduction of humans to the island, forests have been cleared to produce pasture and agricultural land.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet3" />  Extraction of hardwoods for fuel and lumber, as well mining and [[overgrazing]], have also taken their toll.  Today, it is estimated that 90% of Madagascar's original forest cover has been lost.<ref name="Mittermeier57">Mittermeier, p. 57</ref>  Rising populations have created even greater demand in the southwest portion of the island for fuel wood, [[charcoal]], and lumber.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet3" />  Fires from the clearing of grasslands, as well as slash-and-burn agriculture destroy forests.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet3" />  Another threat to the species is harvesting either for food ([[bush meat]]) or [[exotic pet|pet]]s.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet3" />  Finally, periodic drought common to southern Madagascar can impact populations already in decline.  In 1991 and 1992, for example, a severe drought caused an abnormally high morality rate among infants and females at the [[Beza Mahafaly Reserve|Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve]].<ref name="PrimateInfoNet3" />  Two years later, the population had declined by 31% and took nearly four years to start to recover.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet3" />

The Ring-tailed Lemur resides in several protected areas within its range, each offering varying levels of protection.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet3" />  At the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, a holistic approach to [[in situ]] conservation has been taken.  Not only does field research and resource management involve international students and local people (including school children), livestock management is used at the peripheral zones of the reserve and [[ecotourism]] benefits the local people.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet3" />  

Outside of its diminishing habitat and other threats, the Ring-tailed Lemur reproduces readily and has fared well in captivity.<ref name="SDZooFactSheet">{{cite web |date = 2003 |title = Ring-tailed Lemur, Lemur catta fact sheet |publisher=San Diego Zoo Library |url=http://library.sandiegozoo.org/factsheets/lemur_ring-tailed/lemur.htm |accessdate=2008-08-30}}</ref>  For this reason, along with its popularity, it has become the most populous lemur in [[zoo]]s worldwide, with more than 2000 in captivity.<ref name="ISIS" />  [[Ex situ]] facilities actively involved in the conservation of the Ring-tailed Lemur include the [[Duke Lemur Center]] in [[Durham, NC]], the [[Lemur Conservation Foundation]] in Myakka City, FL and the [[Madagascar Fauna Group]] headquartered at the [[Saint Louis Zoo]].  Due to the high success of captive breeding, reintroduction is a possibility if wild populations were to crash.  Although experimental releases have met success on [[St. Catherine's Island]] in Georgia, demonstrating that captive lemurs can readily adapt to their environment and exhibit a full range of natural behaviors, captive release is not currently being considered.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet3" />  

Ring-tailed Lemur populations can also benefit from drought intervention, due to the availability of watering troughs and introduced fruit trees, as seen at the [[Berenty Reserve|Berenty Private Reserve]] in southern Madagascar.<ref name="PrimateInfoNet3" />  However, these interventions are not always seen favorably, since natural population fluctuations are not permitted.  The species is thought to have evolved its high [[fecundity]] due to its harsh environment;<ref name="PrimateInfoNet3" /> therefore, interfering with this natural cycle could significantly impact the gene pool.

The television series depicts real events in the lives of wild Ring-tailed Lemurs, whereas the animated films depict [[anthropomorphic]] representations, such as lemurs talking, singing, and dancing.  The Ring-tailed Lemur was also the focus of the 1996 ''[[Nature (TV series)|Nature]]'' documentary ''A Lemur's Tale'', which was filmed at the Berenty Reserve and followed a troop of lemurs.  The troop included a unique infant named Sapphire, who was nearly [[albino]], with white fur, sparkling blue eyes, and the characteristic ringed tail.

This species also played a role in the 1997 comedy film ''[[Fierce Creatures]]'', starring [[John Cleese]], who has a passion for lemurs.<ref name="PBS_InTheWild">{{cite video | people = John Cleese (host) | year2 = 1998 | title = In the Wild: Operation Lemur with John Cleese | url = http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/inthewild/cleese.html | medium = DVD | publisher = Tigress Productions Ltd for BBC | accessdate = 2008-10-21}}</ref>  In fact, John Cleese also hosted the 1998 [[BBC]] documentary ''In the Wild: Operation Lemur with John Cleese''.
