==Architecture==

===Structure===

St Martin's is built in red [[sandstone]] from [[Wetheral]] quarry; it has green [[slate]] roofs and a lead spire.  Its plan consists of a square west tower, a four-[[bay (architecture)|bay]] [[nave]] with north and south [[aisle]]s, and a single-bay [[chancel]] with a two-storey [[vestry]] to the north and an organ chamber to the south; the body of the church is almost square.  On the north side of the tower is an open arched porch with a lean-to roof.  The west face contains two small two-light windows over which is a larger two-light window; all these windows are recessed within an arch.  Above these are clock faces on all sides of the tower over which are two-light [[louver|louvred]] bell-openings.  At the top of the tower are [[gable]]s to the west and east, and shaped [[parapet]]s to the north and south.  On the tower is a short pointed spire with extensions to the north and south. On the north side of the church are three two-light windows separated by [[buttress]]es, and over each window is a [[battlement]]ed gable.  The south aisle has a round west window, and on the south side are small rectangular windows and three gabled [[dormer]]s in the [[clerestory]].  On the south wall of the organ chamber is a three-light [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]] style window.  The east window has five lights.<ref name=images/>

===Interior===

The entrance leads into the base of the tower that acts as a porch and a [[baptistry]]; this leads in turn through two arches into the nave.  Above the arches is a clear four-light window that is lit by the window in the west wall of the tower. All the ceilings are of painted wood; that of the north aisle is a [[Barrel vault|tunnel vault]], the south aisle ceiling is sloping, and the ceiling of the nave and chancel is flat.<ref name=images/>  On each side of the nave is a four-bay [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] supported by octagonal [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]; there is no chancel arch.  All the stained glass was made in 1878<U+2013>80 by [[Morris & Co.]] and designed by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and [[William Morris]].  The five-light east window contains three tiers of figures.  The central figure at the top is the [[Good Shepherd]], and on each side are angels, the middle tier consists of angels, the central image in the lowest tier is a pelican, bounded on each sides by saints.<ref name=pev>{{citation | last =Pevsner | first =Nikolaus | authorlink =Nikolaus Pevsner | coauthors = | title =The Buildings of England: Cumberland and Westmorland |edition= | publisher =[[Yale University Press]] | year =2002 | origyear=1967 | location = New Haven and London| pages = 74<U+2013>76| url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0 300 09590 2}}</ref>  The east window was a memorial to [[Charles Howard (British politician)|Charles Howard]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]], brother of the [[William George Howard, 8th Earl of Carlisle|8th Earl of Carlisle]].  The [[baptismal font|font]] dates from the 13th&nbsp;century.  To the north of the chancel is a war memorial chapel, with the vestry on the floor above.  The chapel contains an altar panel by [[Byam Shaw]], and a carpet with a William Morris design.<ref name=images/>  The three-[[manual (music)|manual]] organ was built about 1920 by Jardine & Co. of [[Manchester]].  It was rebuilt in 2008 by [[Nicholson & Co (Worcester) Ltd|Nicholson & Co.]] of [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=N01645 | title = Cumberland (Cumbria), Brampton, St. Martin| accessdate = 20&nbsp;April 2010| publisher = [[British Institute of Organ Studies]]}}</ref>  The [[Ring of bells|ring]] consists of six bells that were cast in 1826 by Thomas Mears II of the [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=brampton&Submit=++Go++&DoveID=BRAMPTON+6 | title = Brampton, St Martin | accessdate = 20&nbsp;April 2010| publisher = [[Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers]]}}</ref>

To the west of the church is St Martin's Hall, built in 1895 and designed by C.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Ferguson.  It is constructed in red sandstone with green slate roofs.  The building is in two ranges, with three-bay meeting rooms in front and a five-bay hall behind.  The hall is listed Grade&nbsp;II.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=77810 |title=Images of England: St Martin's Hall, Brampton |publisher=[[English Heritage]] | accessdate= 20&nbsp;April 2010}}</ref>  Between the church and the hall is Church Cottage.  This is also constructed in red sandstone with a slate roof, and pre-dates the church, being built in the early 19th&nbsp;century.  It is a small building in one storey and two bays.
