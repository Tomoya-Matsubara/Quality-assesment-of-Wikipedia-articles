'''Marcus Fulvius Flaccus''' was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Roman Senate|senator]] and an ally of the [[Gracchi]].  He became an administrator of the agrarian reform in 130 BC, and as a solution to the problem of land division among the allied cities, proposed Roman citizenship for the allies' citizens, thus introducing a question that vexed Roman politics for many years.  Elected [[consul]] in 125 BC, he was ordered by the [[Roman Senate]] to assist Massilia (modern [[Marseille]]) against depredations of the [[Salluvii]]. He became the first to overcome the transalpine [[Liguria]]ns in war{{rf|1|Liv_per_60}} and returned in 123 BC with a triumph. 

Flaccus was appointed to the Agrarian Commission in 129 BC.{{rf|2|App_Civ_1.18}} In 122 BC he became a [[tribune]] to assist [[Gaius Gracchus]] in implementing an amended version of his policy of citizenship for [[Italia (Roman province)|Italians]], making him the only ex-consul to hold the position of tribune.{{rf|3|ocd}}

He went to found a Roman colony, Colonia Junonia, on the ruins of [[Carthage]].  When he and Gracchus failed to win re-election in 121 BC, Flaccus led a mass protest on the [[Aventine Hill]], but the consul [[Lucius Opimius]] suppressed it brutally, killing Gracchus and Flaccus among many others.

Plutarch describes him as a born agitator.{{rf|4|Plut_Gaius_10}} Cicero describes Flaccus as an orator of moderate gifts and comments that his writings reveal him as a student of letters rather than an orator.{{rf|5|Cic_Brut_108}}

His wife is unknown. Flaccus had a son called Marcus Fulvius Flaccus Bambalio. Bambalio married [[Sempronia]] Gracchae, the daughter of Roman Tribune [[Gaius Gracchus]]. Their marriage resulted in a daughter and only child [[Fulvia]] Flacca Bambula, who was Flaccus' only grandchild.
