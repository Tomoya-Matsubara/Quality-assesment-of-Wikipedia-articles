'''Kimberley Joseph''' (born August 30, 1973) is a Canadian-Australian actress who is based in the United States. Joseph was rasied on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in Australia and was educated in Switzerland. She began a degree at [[Bond University]] but dropped out when she was cast in the soap opera ''[[Paradise Beach]]'' at the age of 19. She had no formal acting training but appeared in the soap for the 18 months it was produced. After ''Paradise Beach'' she had casual work on ''[[Hey Hey It's Saturday]]'' before she co-hosted the popular [[Seven Network]] series ''[[Gladiators (Australian TV series)|Gladiators]]''.

After two series of ''Gladiators'', Joseph was eager to return to acting, so took a role as villain Joanne Brennan in ''[[Home and Away]]'' from 1995 to 1996. In 1999, she moved to the United States to study acting at the [[Atlantic Theater Company]] in New York, before spending 18 months trying for auditions in Los Angeles. In 2001, she was cast as Jo Ellison in the British television series ''[[Cold Feet]]''. She appeared in the fourth and fifth series and returned to Australia two days after filming the final episode in 2002. In 2004, she appeared in a major recurring role as Dr. Grace Connelly in six episodes of the Australian soap opera ''[[All Saints (TV series)|All Saints]]''. She returned to America after filming ''All Saints'', where she got a small role as flight attendant [[Characters of Lost#Minor Oceanic 815 crash survivors|Cindy Chandler]] in the pilot episode of ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''. The role was supposed to be a one-off in the pilot but a producer liked Joseph and the character, so brought her back for a recurring role in the second and third seasons.

Joseph had no contract with Nine, and was making the appearances because she was friends with host [[Daryl Somers]]. Nine Network executives wanted to make her a regular on the show and began using her in publicity material, however, rival network [[Seven Network|Seven]] offered her a contract to co-host ''[[Gladiators (Australian TV series)|Gladiators]]'' before Nine could make her ''Hey Hey'' contract permanent. Her defection to Nine in 1995 caused a small scandal.<ref name="Turner">{{cite book|author=Turner, Graeme|coauthors= Frances Bonner, P.

Unitl 1999, she worked as a "jobbing actress", making appearances in ''[[Hercules: the Legendary Journeys]]'' and ''[[Sale of the Century (Australian game show)|Sale of the Century]]''.<ref name="Kermond"/><ref name="Sprawson">{{cite news|author= Sprawson, Eleanor|title= Man eater?

On the day she was due to fly back to Australia, her agent informed her of an audition for the British television series ''[[Cold Feet]]'', whose producer was looking for an Australian actress to become a new main cast member. Two weeks later she had moved to [[Manchester]] and was doing script read-throughs with the rest of the cast.<ref name="Driscoll"/> Her character, Jo Ellison, appeared in all episodes of the [[Cold Feet (series 4)|fourth]] and [[Cold Feet (series 5)|fifth]] series. Two days after filming the final episode in 2002, Joseph left Britain and returned to Australia.<ref name="Kermond"/>

In 2004, she appeared on Australian television for the first time since a regular role in ''Tales of the South Seas'' in 1999, playing Dr. Grace Connelly for six episodes on ''[[All Saints (TV series)|All Saints]]''. The day after she completed filming of her scenes, she returned to Los Angeles for the pilot season.<ref name="Sprawson"/> She got a small part as a flight attendant in the [[Pilot (Lost)|pilot episode]] of ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''. Joseph's scenes, on an airplane set, were filmed over two and a half days in Los Angeles. An early script draft of the pilot called for her character to be seen dead on a beach, though subsequent rewrites removed the scene. A producer liked Joseph and her character, and planned to bring both back to the series at a later date. She returned at the beginning of the [[Lost (season 2)|second season]], when it was revealed that her character, given the name [[Characters of Lost#Minor Oceanic 815 crash survivors|Cindy Chandler]], had survived the plane crash in the pilot episode along with other passengers from the tail section of the plane. Despite being asked not to change her appearance too much after the pilot, Joseph had her haircut, so in her first few episodes of the second season, she had to "go through the whole debacle of putting a Rambo scarf around [her] head, which just looked ridiculous."<ref name="Le">{{cite news|author= Le Marquand, Sarrah|title= Lost's tail spin|url= http://entertainment.news.com.au/story/0,10221,18388395-10229,00.html|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060618070533/http://entertainment.news.com.au/story/0,10221,18388395-10229,00.html|date= 8 March 2006|archivedate= 18 June 2006|accessdate= 8August 2008|work= [[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref> Her episodes for season 2 were filmed over five weeks and were broadcast in 2005.<ref name="Le"/> Her character was abducted in the middle of an episode and was not seen again until in the [[Lost (season 3)|third season]], when Joseph reprised the role for two episodes and the whereabouts of her character are revealed.
