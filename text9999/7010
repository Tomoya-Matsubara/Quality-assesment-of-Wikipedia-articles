[[Image:Grey Cup circa 2006.jpg|thumb|The Grey Cup.]]
This is a '''list of Grey Cup champions'''. The [[Grey Cup]] is both the name of the championship of the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) and the name of the trophy awarded to the victorious team. The trophy is named after [[Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey|Albert Grey]], the [[Governor General of Canada]] from 1904 until 1911. He donated the trophy to the [[Football Canada|Canadian Rugby Union]] in [[1909 in sports|1909]] to recognize the top amateur rugby football team in [[Canada]]. By this time [[Canadian football]] had become markedly different from the [[rugby football]] from which it developed. Although it was originally intended to be awarded only to amateur teams (like the [[Stanley Cup]]), over time, the Grey Cup became the property of the Canadian Football League as it evolved into a professional football league. Amateur teams ceased competing for the Cup by [[1954 in Canadian football|1954]]; since 1965, the top amateur teams, playing in [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] (CIS), have competed for the [[Vanier Cup]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/greycup/history.html |title=Grey Cup history|accessdate=2008-01-20 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref> 

First awarded in 1909, there have since been 95 Grey Cup championship games, although there was no game from 1916 to 1919.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tsn.ca/cfl/feature/?fid=3147&hubname= |title=Grey Cup history|accessdate=2008-01-20 |publisher=[[The Sports Network]]}}</ref> It is Canada's largest annual sports and television event, regularly drawing a Canadian viewing audience of about 4 million.<ref name="Houston">{{cite web |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20061220.wsptcfl20/TPStory/Sports/columnists|title=Grey |title=Cup moves to TSN in new deal |accessdate=2007-06-07 |last=Houston |first=William |date=[[December 20]] [[2006]] |publisher=''[[The Globe and Mail]]''}}</ref><ref name="Houston 2006-11-20">{{Cite web|url=http://www.globesports.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20061120.wspttruth20/GSStory/GlobeSportsFootball/home|title=Minor rise in Grey Cup ratings good for CBC|accessdate=2006-12-03|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]|year=2006-11-20|author=William Houston}}</ref> Two awards are given for play in the game, [[Grey Cup Most Valuable Player|Most Valuable Player]] and the [[Dick Suderman Trophy]] as most valuable Canadian player.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/greycup/mvp_top.html |title=MVP and Top Canadians|accessdate=2008-01-20 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref>

==Win/Loss records==
Although the official website of the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] counts them as the same team, the Tiger-Cats, Hamilton Alerts, Hamilton Tigers and Hamilton Flying Wildcats are all listed separately<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ticats.ca/index.php?module=page&id=4038|title=History - Grey Cup|accessdate=2008-01-15|publisher=Hamilton Tiger-Cats}}</ref> because when they were active, the teams competed as separate franchises and in 1950, the Tigers and Flying Wildcats merged to create the Tiger-Cats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ticats.ca/index.php?module=page&id=4014|title=Tiger-Cats History|accessdate=2008-01-15|publisher=Hamilton Tiger-Cats}}</ref>
