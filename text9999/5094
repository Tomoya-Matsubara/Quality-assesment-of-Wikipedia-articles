'''Interstate 355''' (abbreviated '''I-355'''), also known as the '''North-South Tollway''', is a 20-mile (32 km) [[interstate highway]] and [[toll road|tollway]] located in the western suburbs of [[Chicago, Illinois]], [[United States|USA]] (part of a metropolitan area sometimes known as [[Chicagoland]]). Although the interstate is known for being a tollway, the tollway portion actually starts south of Army Trail Road, 2 miles (4 km) south of the northern terminus. Exits to [[U.S. Route 20]] (Lake Street) and Army Trail Road from the north are free, and pre-existed on the freeway portion of old [[Illinois Route 53]]. 

== Route description ==
[[Image:I-355 at IPP.JPG|thumbnail|250px|[[Interstate 355]] at the [[Illinois Prairie Path]], looking south towards [[Oak Brook, Illinois|Oak Brook]] in the distance.]]
I-355 is a spur route of [[Interstate 55]], and I-55 serves as I-355's southern terminus, in extreme northern [[Will County, Illinois|Will County]].  There are two toll plazas on the interstate.  I-355's northern terminus is with [[Interstate 290 (Illinois)|Interstate 290]] in [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]]. After the southern extension is completed in [[2007]], Interstate 355 will terminate at [[Interstate 80]] in the [[Joliet, Illinois|Joliet]] area.

In Chicagoland traffic reports, Interstate 290 north of the tollway and Illinois 53 north of [[Interstate 90]] are also considered to be part of the tollway, even though they are freeways. This is because it is easier to refer to the entire north-south length as a continuous route in traffic reports instead of separating the route into its three distinct parts.

== History ==

Interstate 355 was commissioned in 1989 to ease pressure on nearby Illinois 53, and to a lesser extent, to ease pressure on the rapidly-growing [[Tri-State Tollway]] ([[Interstate 294]]). Illinois 53 was at that point the main north-south artery through central DuPage County. It frequently suffered from overcrowding, as it was two lanes (one northbound, one southbound) for most of its length. During construction, the highway had to be built around the ecologically sensitive and low-lying [[DuPage River]] valley, as well as the [[Morton Arboretum]].

The road opened on [[December 24]], [[1989]]. As a Christmas "gift," the first two days of operation were completely free. Initially, the road was a four lane highway from [[Illinois Route 64]] (North Avenue) to [[Interstate 88 (west)|Interstate 88]] ([[Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway]]) even though it was built wide enough to be six; within the first few years, the two-lane wide shoulders were converted to the third lane in each direction due to overcrowding. The old lines marking the former shoulder can still be seen in the right lane as a result of the Tollway Authority's attempt to grind them away.

Being one of the newer tollways in the system, the North-South Tollway has also seen considerable improvements earlier than the other tollways. Around the late 1990s, the North-South Tollway became the first tollway to have [[I-PASS]] installed; only a few years later, it become the first tollway (and second installation behind the lesser-used [[Edens Spur]]) to have I-PASS Express Lanes, a form of [[open road tolling]] (ORT).

The Tollway Authority's grander vision of ORT will also be instituted first on the North-South Tollway, when the express lanes are widened one lane to three lanes in each direction. This will allow the number of express lanes to match the number of travel lanes on the tollway, one of the goals of ORT.

In late [[2005]], construction began on the southern extension of I-355 from Bolingbrook to Joliet. This portion will look similar to the southern portion of current I-355 south of Interstate 88. Prior to construction, local residents protested against the expressway because of reduction in their property values. In addition, some environmentalists protested because of the sensitivity of the Des Plaines River [[wetland]]s where construction would take place. [[Will County, Illinois|Will County]] officials lobbied for the extension in an attempt to boost economic development in the Joliet-to-Woodridge corridor.

=== Southern extension ===
[[Image:Interstate_355_Southern_Extension_Large.jpg|thumbnail|left|Map of the southern extension of the North-South Tollway]]
The [[Illinois State Toll Highway Authority]] has plans to extend I-355 further south to [[Interstate 80]] and perhaps to [[Interstate 57]] and around to [[Interstate 65]], relieving congestion on Interstate 80/94. Bidding on an excavation contract passed on November 18th of [[2004]] with construction beginning several days later, and barring any further legal delays the extension to Interstate 80 is to be completed by late [[2007]].

Six interchanges will be modified or created with the southern extension, located at:
* [[Interstate 55]]
* 127th Street
* 143rd Street and [[Illinois Route 171]] (Archer Avenue)
* 159th Street ([[Illinois Route 7]])
* [[U.S. Route 6]] (Southwest Highway)
* [[Interstate 80]]

The extension will be 12.5 miles (20 km) long, and feature a 1.5 mile (2 km) long bridge over the [[Des Plaines River]], the [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]], the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]], Bluff Road, numerous railroads, and the Commonwealth Edison utility corridor.

== Notes ==
* There are no [[Illinois Tollway Oasis|Illinois Tollway Oases]] on the North-South Tollway. The decision not to build oases may have been motivated by the short lengths of commutes taken on the tollway, a lack of open space along the tollway's right-of-way, and the frequency of exits on the tollway. In general, oases are present where there is a notable lack of accessible fuel and food services, which is not the case in the well-developed western suburbs.
