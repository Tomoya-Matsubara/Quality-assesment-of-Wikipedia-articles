'''''Il Popolo d'Italia''''' ("The People of Italy"), was an [[Italian language|Italian]] newspaper founded by [[Benito Mussolini]] on November 15, 1914, as a result of his split with the [[Italian Socialist Party]]. ''Il Popolo d'Italia'' ran until July 24, 1943 and became the foundation for the [[Italian fascism|Fascist movement]] in [[Italy]] after [[World War I]]. The paper, advocating [[militarism]] and [[Italia irredenta|irredentism]], was subsidized by the [[France|French]] and industrialists on the pretext of influencing Italy to join the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]. This is also where Mussolini spread his ideas about how he wanted Italy to increase its [[birth rate]]. From 1936 to 1943 it was edited by [[Giorgio Pini]].
