'''''Who Framed Roger Rabbit''''' is a 1988 [[fantasy film|fantasy]]-[[comedy film]] directed by [[Robert Zemeckis]], produced by [[Steven Spielberg]] and based on [[Gary K. Wolf]]'s novel ''[[Who Censored Roger Rabbit?]]''. The film combines the use of [[Traditional animation#Live-action hybrids|traditional animation and live action]] with elements of [[film noir]], and stars [[Bob Hoskins]], [[Charles Fleischer]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Kathleen Turner]] and [[Joanna Cassidy]]. ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' is set in 1947 [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], where [[Toon]]s commonly interact with the [[studio system]] of [[Classical Hollywood cinema]]. The film tells the story of [[private investigator]] Eddie Valiant caught in a mystery that involves Roger Rabbit, an [[A-list]] Toon who is [[frameup|framed]] for murder.

[[Walt Disney Pictures]] purchased the [[film rights]] to ''Who Censored Roger Rabbit?'' in 1981. [[Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman]] wrote two drafts of the script before Disney brought Spielberg and [[Amblin Entertainment]] to help finance the film. Zemeckis was hired to direct the live action scenes with [[Richard Williams]] overseeing the animation sequences. For inspiration, Price and Seaman studied the work of [[Walt Disney]] and [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] from the [[Golden Age of American animation]], especially [[Tex Avery]] and [[Bob Clampett]] cartoons. Production was moved from Los Angeles to [[Elstree Studios]] in England to accommodate Williams and his group of animators.

During filming, the production budget began to rapidly expand and the [[shooting schedule]] lapsed longer than expected. However, ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' was released with financial success and critical acclaim. The film brought a re-emerging interest from the golden age of American animation and became the forefront for the [[modern animation in the United States|modern era]]. ''Roger Rabbit'' left behind an impact that included a [[List of Who Framed Roger Rabbit media|media franchise]] and the unproduced [[prequel]] ''Who Discovered Roger Rabbit''.

==Plot==
In 1947, [[Los Angeles, California]], [[Toon]]s commonly interact with the [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] [[studio system]] and live in a section of the city known as [[Toontown]]. Roger Rabbit is the star of "Maroon Cartoon" animated [[short subject]]s, but he has trouble following the director's commands, delaying the production. Studio head R.K. Maroon hires [[private investigator]] Eddie Valiant to find out what is bothering Roger. Valiant, whose brother Teddy was killed by a Toon years ago, reluctantly takes the job. He discovers that Roger's wife, the [[female body shape|buxom]] Jessica Rabbit, seems to have cheated on him, literally playing [[Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker's man|pattycake]] with Marvin Acme, owner of the [[Acme Corporation]]. Valiant reveals photographic evidence to Roger, who sinks into depression. Marvin Acme is found murdered the next day, and Roger becomes the prime suspect. 

[[Image:Judgedoom.PNG|thumb|left|Judge Doom threatens Roger Rabbit before introducing him to "The Dip"]]
At the crime scene, Valiant is met by Judge Doom of the Toontown District Superior Court and his Toon Patrol [[weasel]] henchmen. Doom is anxious to use "The Dip", a mixture of chemicals that can dissolve any Toon character on contact, on Roger once he can be found. Valiant encounters Baby Herman, Roger's co-star, who swears that Roger is innocent and that Acme's [[will (law)|will]], which would have left Toontown to the Toons, has gone missing; if the will is not found by midnight, Toontown could be sold at a public auction. Valiant begins to investigate the case deeper with his on-off girlfriend Dolores and a Toon taxicab named Benny while trying to keep Roger hidden from the Toon Patrol. Valiant discovers that Jessica was forced by Maroon to get close to Acme or else he would have ruined Roger's career. Maroon himself admits that he was forced into blackmail by another person, but before he can reveal who it was to Valiant, he is shot. 

Valiant overcomes his anxiety and chases the murderer into Toontown; though he loses the trail, he recovers Maroon's murder weapon. Valiant encounters Jessica in Toontown who points out that the gun belongs to Judge Doom.  As they attempt to bring Doom to the authorities, Valiant, Jessica and Roger are all captured by the Toon Patrol and taken to the Acme warehouse. Doom reveals his plans; as the sole stockholder in Cloverleaf Industries, he plans to buy Toontown, the Acme Company, and Maroon Studios, and then raze them to make way for a [[freeway]] for Los Angeles. To wipe out Toontown, Doom has built a vehicle with a large Dip vat that he plans to spray throughout the district, wiping out all the Toons. As Roger and Jessica struggle to avoid being hit by the spray of Dip, Valiant manages to get free and causes the weasels of the Toon Patrol to literally [[Fatal hilarity|die of laughter]] through various antics, leaving the Dip sprayer running automatically.

Valiant and Doom then fight, using the assorted Toon props in the factory, until Valiant is able to run Doom over with a [[steamroller]]. The crushing does not kill Doom; instead, Doom reveals himself to be a Toon, the same one that killed Valiant's brother. Valiant manages to open the drain on the Dip sprayer, showering Doom with the mixture and dissolving him. Valiant frees Roger and Jessica, their relationship having been mended, while the Dip sprayer harmlessly crashes through the warehouse wall into Toontown and immediately smashed by a Toon train. As numerous Toons enter the warehouse to see what the commotion is, Valiant discovers Acme's will. It was an apparent blank piece of paper that Acme had given to Jessica that Roger later wrote a love poem to his wife on, but the will itself was written in [[invisible ink|disappearing/reappearing ink]]. With the will in hand, the Toons celebrate the ownership of Toontown and sing "Smile, Darn Ya, Smile" while Roger and Jessica as well as Valiant and Dolores rekindle their relationships.

==Cast==
{{main|List of Who Framed Roger Rabbit characters}}
*'''[[Bob Hoskins]]''' as '''Eddie Valiant''': An alcoholic private investigator who strongly dislikes [[Toon]]s. Years ago, Valiant's brother was killed by a Toon after a piano was dropped on his head. Producer Steven Spielberg's first choice for Eddie Valiant was [[Harrison Ford]], but he was asking for too much money.<ref name="Williams">{{cite book | author= [[James B. Stewart]] | title = [[DisneyWar]] | publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]] | year =2005 | location = New York City | pages = 86 | id = ISBN 0-684-80993-1}}</ref>
*'''[[Charles Fleischer]]''' provides the voice of '''Roger Rabbit''': An [[A-list]] Toon working for "Maroon Cartoons". Roger frequently has a problem with his [[speech disorder|speech impediment]] and is eventually framed for murder for the death of Marvin Acme. Fleischer also provides the voices of Benny the Cab and a member of Doom's Weasel Gang. To facilitate Hoskins' performance, Fleischer dressed in a Roger bunny suit and "stood in" behind camera for most scenes. Lou Hirsch, who supplied the voice for Baby Herman, was the original choice for Benny the Cab, but was replaced by Fleischer.<ref name="ears">[[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Richard Williams]], [[Bob Hoskins]], [[Charles Fleischer]], [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]], [[Alan Silvestri]], Ken Ralston, ''Behind the Ears: The True Story of Roger Rabbit'', 2003, [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]]</ref> Animation director [[Richard Williams]] explained Roger Rabbit was a combination of "[[Tex Avery]]'s cashew nut-shaped head, the swatch of red hair...like [[Droopy]]'s, [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]]'s overalls, [[Porky Pig]]'s bow tie and [[Mickey Mouse]]'s gloves."<ref name="Norman" />
*'''[[Christopher Lloyd]]''' as '''Judge Doom''': The sadistic judge of Toontown District Superior Court. It is eventually revealed that Doom is indeed a Toon, and responsible for the death of Valiant's brother. Lloyd was cast because he previously worked with director Robert Zemeckis and [[Amblin Entertainment]] in ''[[Back to the Future]]''. Lloyd decided it was best not to blink his eyes to perfectly portray the character.<ref name="comment" />
*'''[[Kathleen Turner]]''' provides the voice of '''Jessica Rabbit''': Roger Rabbit's [[Physical attractiveness|physically attractive]] wife. [[Amy Irving]] supplied the singing voice, while [[Betsy Brantley]] served as the [[stand-in]].
*'''[[Joanna Cassidy]]''' as '''Dolores''': Valiant's on-off girlfriend who helps him and Roger solve the case against Judge Doom. Dolores is also a waitress.
*'''[[Alan Tilvern]]''' as '''R.K. Maroon''': Temporous owner of "Maroon Cartoon" studios. Maroon hires Valiant to find out what is bothering Roger in his poor acting performances. He is eventually murdered by Judge Doom.
*'''[[Stubby Kaye]]''' as '''Marvin Acme''': [[Jester|Prankster]]-like owner of the [[Acme Corporation]]. The scandal of Acme [[Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker's man|playing pattycake]] with Jessica leads to his own death.
*'''[[Lou Hirsch]]''' as '''Baby Herman''': Roger's frequent co-star in Maroon Cartoons. Williams said Baby Herman was a mixture of "[[Elmer Fudd]] and [[Tweety]] crashed together".<ref name="Norman" /> [[April Winchell]] provides the voice of Mrs. Herman and the "baby noises".

[[Richard LeParmentier]] has a small role as Lt. Santino. [[Joel Silver]] makes a [[cameo appearance]] as the frustrated director at the beginning of the film. Archive sound of [[Frank Sinatra]] from "[[Witchcraft (song)|Witchcraft]]" was used for the Singing Sword. In addition to Charles Fleischer, The Weasel gang voices were provided by [[David L. Lander]], [[Fred Newman (actor)|Fred Newman]] and [[June Foray]]. [[Mel Blanc]] voiced [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]], [[Tweety Bird]], [[Porky Pig]] and [[Sylvester the Cat]].

==Production==
===Development===
[[Walt Disney Pictures]] purchased the [[film rights]] to [[Gary Wolf]]'s novel ''[[Who Censored Roger Rabbit?]]'' shortly after its publication in 1981. [[Ron W. Miller]], then president of [[The Walt Disney Company]] saw it as a perfect opportunity to produce a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]].<ref name="War">Stewart, p.72</ref> [[Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman]] were hired to write the script, penning two drafts. [[Robert Zemeckis]] offered his services as director in 1982,<ref name="Norman">{{cite book | author = Norman Kagan | title = The Cinema of Robert Zemeckis | date = May 2003 | publisher = [[Rowman & Littlefield]] | location = Lanham, Maryland | chapter = Who Framed Roger Rabbit | pages = 93-117 | isbn = 0-87833-293-6}}</ref> but Disney acknowledged that his previous films (''[[I Wanna Hold Your Hand (film)|I Wanna Hold Your Hand]]'' and ''[[Used Cars]]'') were [[box office bomb]]s, and thus let him go.<ref name="comment">[[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman]], Ken Ralston, [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]], Steve Starkey, DVD audio commentary, 2003, [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]]</ref> When [[Michael Eisner]] became the new Disney president, he revamped the project in 1985. [[Amblin Entertainment]], which consisted of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]] and [[Kathleen Kennedy (film producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]], were approached to produce ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' alongside Disney. The original budget was projected at $50 million, which Disney felt was too expensive.<ref name="Williams" /> 

''Roger Rabbit'' was finally [[greenlight]]ed when the budget went down to $29.9 million, which at the time, still made it the most expensive animated film ever greenlighted.<ref name="Williams" /> Disney executive [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] argued that the hybrid of live action and animation would "save" [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney's animation department]]. Spielberg's contract included a extensive amount of creative control and a large percentage of the [[box office]] profits. Disney kept all merchandising rights.<ref name="Williams" /> Spielberg convinced [[Warner Bros.]], [[Paramount Pictures]] ([[Famous Studios]] and [[Fleischer Studios]]) and [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] ([[Margaret J. Winkler|Winkler Pictures]] and [[Walter Lantz Productions]]) to "lend" their characters to appear in the film. However, he was not able to acquire [[Popeye]], [[Felix the Cat]], [[Tom and Jerry]] or the [[Terrytoons]] for appearances.<ref name="Norman" /><ref name="comment" /> [[Terry Gilliam]] was offered the chance to direct, but he found the project too technically challenging. "Pure laziness on my part" Gilliam said he "completely regret[s] that decision".<ref>{{cite news | author = Ian Nathan | title = Dreams: Terry Gilliam's Unresolved Projects | work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = May 1996 | pages = 37-40}}</ref> Robert Zemeckis was hired to direct in 1985, based on the success of ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future]]''. [[Richard Williams]] was hired to direct the animation sequences.<ref name="Williams" />

===Writing===
[[Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman]] were brought aboard to continue writing the script once Spielberg and Zemeckis were hired. For inspiration, the two writers studied the work of [[Walt Disney]] and [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] from the [[Golden Age of American animation]], especially [[Tex Avery]] and [[Bob Clampett]] cartoons. ''[[Chinatown (film)|Chinatown]]'' influenced the storyline.<ref name="Norman" /> Price and Seaman said that "the [[Pacific Electric Railway|Red Car]] plot, [[suburb]] expansion and [[urban culture|urban]] [[political corruption]] really did happen," Price stated. "In Los Angeles, during the 1940s, car and tire companies teamed up against the Pacific Electric Railway system and brought them out of business. Where the freeway runs in Los Angeles is where the Red Car use to be."<ref name="comment" /> In Wolf's novel ''Who Censored Roger Rabbit?'', the Toons were [[comic strip]] characters rather than movie stars.<ref name="Norman" /> 

During the writing process, Price and Seaman were unsure of whom to include as antagonist. They wrote scripts that had either Jessica Rabbit or Baby Herman as the villain, but they made their final decision with newly-created character Judge Doom. Doom was suppose to have an animated [[vulture]] sit on his shoulder, but this was deleted for technical challenges.<ref name="comment" /> Doom's five-man "Weasel Gang" (Stupid, Smart Ass, Greasy, Wheezy and Psycho) satires the Seven Dwarfs (Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy and Dopey) who appeared in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937).<ref name="comment" /> Further references included The "Ink and Paint Club" resembling the [[Cotton Club (New York City)|Harlem Cotton Club]], while Zemeckis compared Judge Doom's invention of "The Dip" to eliminate all the Toons as [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Final Solution]]<ref name="Norman" /> Benny the Cab was first concepted to be a [[Volkswagen Beetle]] instead of a [[Taxicab]]. Before finally agreeing on ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' as the film's title, [[working title]]s included ''Murder in Toontown'', ''Toons'', ''Dead Toons Don't Pay Bills'', ''The Toontown Trial'', ''Trouble in Toontown'' and ''Eddie Goes To Toontown''.<ref>DVD production notes</ref>

===Filming===
Animation director [[Richard Williams]] admitted he was "openly disdainful of the Disney [[bureaucracy]]"<ref name="Katz" /> and refused to work in Los Angeles. To accommodate him and his animators, production was moved to [[Elstree Studios]] in [[Hertfordshire]], England. Disney and Spielberg also told Williams that in return for doing ''Roger Rabbit'', they would help distribute his unproduced film ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]''.<ref name="Katz" /> Supervising animators included [[Andreas Deja]], [[Simon Wells]], [[Phil Nibbelink]], [[Nik Ranieri]] and [[Dale Baer]]. The production budget continued to escalate while the [[shooting schedule]] lapsed longer than expected. When the budget was reaching $40 million, Disney president [[Michael Eisner]] heavily considered shutting down production, but [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] talked him out of it.<ref name="Katz">Stewart, p.87</ref> Disney moved forward on production, despite the escalating budget because they were enthusiastic to work with Spielberg.<ref name="Williams" /> 

[[VistaVision]] cameras installed with [[motion control]] technology were used to accommodate the [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split screen]] photography of animation and live action. [[Mime artist]]s, [[puppeteer]]s, [[mannequin]]s and [[robotic arm]]s were commonly used during filming to help the actors interact with "open air and imaginative cartoon characters".<ref name="ears" /> Filming began on December 5, 1986 and lasted for 7.5 months at Elstree Studios, with an additional four weeks in Los Angeles and at [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) for [[chroma key|blue screen]] effects of [[Toontown]]. [[Post-production]] lasted for one year, and during this time ILM finished the color compositing.<ref name="comment" /> Jessica's dress in the night club scene, for instance, had flashing [[sequin]]s, an effect created by filtering light through a [[plastic bag]] scratched with [[steel wool]].<ref name="Norman" /> Regular Zemeckis collaborator [[Alan Silvestri]] composed the [[film score]] with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] (LSO). Zemeckis joked that "the British could not keep up with Silvestri's [[Jazz]] tempo". The [[theme (music)|music theme]]s written for Jessica Rabbit were entirely [[improvisation|improvised]] by the LSO. The work of [[Carl Stalling]] heavily influenced Silvestri's work on ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit''.<ref name="ears" /><ref name="comment" />

==Release==
[[Michael Eisner]], then president of [[The Walt Disney Company]], complained ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' was too risqu<U+00E9> with sexual [[innuendo]]s.<ref name="Mickey" /> Eisner and Zemeckis disagreed over elements with the film, but since Zemeckis had [[final cut privilege]], he refused to make alterations.<ref name="ears" /> [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] felt it was appropriate to release the film under their [[Touchstone Pictures]] banner.<ref name="Mickey" /> ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' opened on June 22, 1988 in America, grossing $11,226,239 in 1,045 theaters during its opening weekend. The film went on to gross $156.45 million in North America and $173.35 million internationally, coming to a worldwide total of $329.8 million. At the time of release, ''Roger Rabbit'' was the twentieth highest-grossing film of all time.<ref>{{cite web | title = Who Framed Roger Rabbit | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=whoframedrogerrabbit.htm | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate = 2008-11-01}}</ref> The film was also the second highest grossing film of 1988, only behind ''[[Rain Man]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title = 1988 Domestic Totals | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1988&p=.htm | accessdate = 2008-11-01}}</ref> 

[[Roger Ebert]] gave a largely positive review, predicting it would carry "the type of [[word of mouth]] that money can't buy.

Zemeckis had Walt Disney Pictures' enthusiastic backing, producer Steven Spielberg's pull, Warner Bros.'s blessing, British animator Richard Williams' ink and paint, Mel Blanc's voice, Jeffrey Price's and Peter S.

However, [[Richard Corliss]], writing for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', gave a mixed review. "The opening cartoon works just fine, but too fine. The opening scene upstages the movie that emerges from it," he said. Corliss was mainly annoyed by the [[homage]]s towards the [[Golden Age of American animation]].<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Richard Corliss]] | title = Creatures of A Subhuman Species | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967766,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 1988-06-27 | accessdate = 2008-11-01}}</ref> Today, 43 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]] indicated 98% of reviewers enjoyed the film, earning an average score of 8.2/10.

===Controversies===
With the film's [[Laserdisc]] release, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' first reported in March 1994 that observers "uncovered several scenes of subliminal antics from the animators that featured nudity of the Jessica Rabbit character.

[[Gary Wolf]], author of the novel ''[[Who Censored Roger Rabbit?]]'' filed a lawsuit in 2001 against [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Wolf claimed he was owed royalties based on the value of "gross receipts" and merchandising sales. In 2002, the trial court in the case ruled that these only referred to actual cash receipts Disney collected and denied Wolf's claim. In its January 2004 ruling, the California Court of Appeal disagreed, finding that expert testimony introduced by Wolf regarding the customary use of "gross receipts" in the entertainment business could support a broader reading of the term. The ruling vacated the trial court's order in favor of Disney and remanded the case for further proceedings.<ref>{{cite news | author = Paul Sweeting | title = Disney, ''Roger Rabbit'' author in spat | work = [[Video Business]] | date = 2004-02-05 | url = http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA614737.html | accessdate = 2008-11-04}}</ref> In a March 2005 hearing, Wolf estimated he was owed $7 million.

===Prequel===
With the critical and financial success of ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'', Walt Disney Pictures and Steven Spielberg felt it was obvious to plan a second installment. [[Nat Mauldin]] wrote a [[prequel]] titled ''Roger Rabbit Two: The Toon Platoon'', set in 1941. Similar to the previous film, ''Toon Platoon'' featured many [[cameo appearance]]s with characters from the [[golden Age of American animation]]. It began with Roger Rabbit's early years, living on a farm in the [[Midwestern United States]].<ref name="Gore" /> With human Richie Davenport, Roger travels west to seek his mother, in the process meeting Jessica Krupnick (his future wife), a struggling Hollywood actress. Jessica is kidnapped and forced to make pro-[[Nazi Germany]] broadcasts, thus Roger and Ritchie must save her by going into Nazi-occupied Europe. After their triumph, Roger and Ritchie are given a [[Hollywood Boulevard]] parade, and Roger is finally reunited with his mother, and father: [[Bugs Bunny]].<ref name="Gore">{{cite book | author = [[Chris Gore]] | title = The 50 Greatest Movies Never Made | date = July 1999 | publisher = [[St. Martin's Press]] | location = New York City | chapter = Roger Rabbit Two: The Toon Platoon | pages = 165-168 | isbn = 0-312-20082-X}}</ref> 

Mauldin later retitled the script ''Who Discovered Roger Rabbit''. Spielberg left the project when deciding he could not satirize Nazis after directing ''[[Schindler's List]]''.<ref>{{cite news | author = Steve Daly | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20192040,00.html | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 2008-04-16 | title = Steven Spielberg and George Lucas: The Titans Talk! | accessdate = 2008-04-17}}</ref><ref name="world">{{cite news | author = Martin "Dr. Toon" Goodman | title = Who Screwed Roger Rabbit? | work = Animation World Magazine | url = http://mag.awn.com/index.php?article_no=1739 | date = 2003-04-03 | accessdate = 2008-11-03}}</ref> [[Michael Eisner]] commissioned a rewrite in 1997 with [[Sherri Stoner]] and [[Deanna Oliver]]. Although they kept Roger's search for his mother, Stoner and Oliver changed the story to Roger<U+2019>s inadvertent rise to stardom on [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]] and Hollywood. Disney was impressed and [[Alan Menken]] was hired to write five songs for the film and offered his services as executive producer.<ref name="world" /> One of the songs, "This Only Happens in the Movies", was recorded in 2008 on the debut album of Broadway actress [[Kerry Butler]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=25560 | title = Kerry Butler's 'Faith, Trust and Pixie Dust' Set For May Release | work = Broadway World | date = 2008-02-28 | accessdate = 2008-11-04}}</ref> [[Eric Goldberg (film director)|Eric Goldberg]] was set to be the new animation director, and began to redesign Roger's new character appearance.<ref name="world" /> 

Spielberg had no interest with the project because he was establishing [[DreamWorks]], although [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]] and [[Kathleen Kennedy (film producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] decided to stay on as producers. Test footage for ''Who Discovered Roger Rabbit'' was shot sometime in 1998 at the Disney animation unit in [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida]]; the results were an unwieldy mix of CGI, traditional animation and live-action that did not please Disney. A second test had the [[Toon]]s completely converted to [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]]; but this was dropped because of the escalating $100 million. Eisner felt it was best to cancel the film.<ref name="world" /> In March 2003, producer [[Don Hahn]] said "don't expect a ''Roger Rabbit'' sequel anytime soon. Animation today is completely conquered by computers, and traditional animation just isn't the forefront anymore."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2003-03-26-rabbit_x.htm | title = Don't expect a ''Rabbit'' sequel | work = [[USA Today]] | date = 2003-03-26 | accessdate = 2008-11-04}}</ref> In December 2007, Marshall admitted he was still "open" to the idea.<ref name="Frank">{{cite news | url= http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2007/12/11/roger-rabbit-sequel-still-in-the-offing-stay-tooned-says-producer/ | title = ''Roger Rabbit'' Sequel Still In The Offing?
