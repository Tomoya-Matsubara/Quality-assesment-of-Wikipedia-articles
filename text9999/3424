The '''Banzhaf power index''', named after [[John F. Banzhaf III]] (though originally invented by {{harvtxt|Penrose|1946}}), is a [[power (sociology)|power]] index defined by the [[probability]] of changing an [[outcome]] of a vote where voting rights are not necessarily equally divided among the [[voters]] or [[shareholders]].

To calculate the power of a voter using the Banzhaf index, list all the winning coalitions, then count the critical voters.  A ''critical voter'' is a voter who, if he changed his vote from yes to no, would cause the measure to fail.  A voter's power is measured as the fraction of all swing votes that he could cast.

== Examples ==

A simple voting game, taken from ''Game Theory and Strategy'' by Phillip D. Straffin:

[6; 4, 3, 2, 1]

The numbers in the brackets mean a measure requires 6 votes to pass, and voter A can cast four votes, B three votes, C two, and D one.  The winning groups, with underlined swing voters, are as follows:

<u>AB</u>, <u>AC</u>, <u>A</u>BC, <u>AB</u>D, <u>AC</u>D, <u>BCD</u>, ABCD

There are 12 total swing votes, so by the Banzhaf index, power is divided thus.

A = 5/12    B = 3/12    C = 3/12    D = 1/12

Consider the [[U.S. Electoral College]].  Each state has more or less power than the next state.  There are a total of 538 electoral votes.  A [[majority vote]] is considered 270 votes.  The Banzhaf Power Index would be a mathematical representation of how likely a single state would be able to swing the vote.  For a state such as [[California]], which is allocated 55 electoral votes, they would be more likely to swing the vote than a state such as [[Montana]], which only has 3 electoral votes.

The [[United States]] is having a presidential election between a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].  For simplicity, suppose that only three states are participating: [[California]] (55 electoral votes), [[Texas]] (34 electoral votes), and [[New York]] (31 electoral votes).

The possible outcomes of the election are:

! California (55)
! Texas (34)
! New York (31)
! R votes
! D votes
! States that could swing the vote

|-

|}

The Banzhaf Power Index of a state is the proportion of the possible outcomes in which that state could swing the election.  In this example, all three states have the same index: 4/12 or 1/3.

However, if New York is replaced by Ohio, with only 20 electoral votes, the situation changes dramatically.

{| class="wikitable" align=center
! California (55)
! Texas (34)
! Ohio (20)
! R votes
! D votes
! States that could swing the vote
|- 
| R
| R
| R
| 109
| 0
| California (D would win 55-54)
|- 
| R

| California (R would win 75-34)
|-
| D

| D
| 0
| 109
| California (R would win 55-54)
|}

In this example, the Banzhaf index gives California 1 and the other states 0, since California alone has more than half the votes.

== History ==

What is known today as the Banzhaf Power Index has originally been introduced by {{harvtxt|Penrose|1946}} and went largely forgotten. 
It has been reinvented by  {{harvtxt|Banzhaf|1965}}, but it had to be reinvented once more by {{harvtxt|Coleman|1971}} before it became part of the mainstream literature. 

[[John F. Banzhaf III|Banzhaf]] wanted to prove objectively that the [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]] Board's voting system was unfair.  Votes were divided as follows (this information also taken from Game Theory and Strategy, though it can probably be verified elsewhere):
[Hempstead #1, Hempstead #2, North Hempstead, Oyster Bay, Glen Cove, Long Beach] are A-F in
[16; 9, 9, 7, 3, 1, 1]

The winning coalitions and their swing voters are:

<u>AB</u> <u>AC</u> <u>BC</u> ABC <u>AB</u>D <u>AB</u>E <u>AB</u>F  <u>AC</u>D <u>AC</u>E <u>AC</u>F <u>BC</u>D <u>BC</u>E <u>BC</u>F ABCD ABCE ABCF <u>AB</u>DE <u>AB</u>DF <u>AB</u>EF <u>AC</u>DE <u>AC</u>DF <u>AC</u>EF <u>BC</u>DE <u>BC</u>DF <u>BC</u>EF ABCDE ABCDF ABCEF <u>AB</u>DEF <u>AC</u>DEF <u>BC</u>DEF ABCDEF

The Banzhaf index gives these values.
Hempstead #1 = 16/48    Hempstead #2 = 16/48    North Hempstead = 16/48    Oyster Bay = 0/48    Glen Cove = 0/48    Long Beach = 0/48

Obviously, a voting arrangement that gives 0% of the power to 16% of the population is unfair, and Banzhaf sued the board. 

Today, the Banzhaf power index is an accepted way to measure voting power, along with the alternative [[Shapley-Shubik power index]].

However, Banzhaf's analysis has been critiqued as treating votes like coin-flips, and an empirical model of voting rather than a random voting model as used by Banzhaf brings different results {{harv|Gelman|Katz|2002}}.
