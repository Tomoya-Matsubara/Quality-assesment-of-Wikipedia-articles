Following the exciting [[Summit Series|1972 Summit Series]] between Canada and the Soviet Union, interest in a world professional [[ice hockey]] championship increased substantially.  The '''Canada Cup''' would bring together the top hockey-playing countries in the world.

It was held in 1976, 1981, 1984, 1987 and 1991. It featured competition between teams representing [[Canada]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Finland]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Sweden]], the [[United States]], and (in 1984 only, taking the place of Finland) [[West Germany]]. All the tournaments were won by Canada except the 1981 tournament, which was won by the Soviet Union. The [[1987]] event is often called one of the most spectacular in hockey history as #99 [[Wayne Gretzky]] and #66 [[Mario Lemieux]] combined forces to capture the [[Canada Cup]] at [[Copps Coliseum]] as Team Canada defeated the Soviets. Canada won that series 2 games to one and all three games ended in 6-to-5 scores. <ref name=memproj2>{{cite press release| title = "Tigertown Triumphs"| publisher =The Hamilton Spectator-Memory Project (Souvenir Edition) page MP56| date =[[2006-06-10]]| accessdate = 2007-02-16}}</ref> The 1987 and [[1991]] finals were both held in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. <ref name=memproj2>{{cite press release| title = "Tigertown Triumphs"| publisher =The Hamilton Spectator-Memory Project (Souvenir Edition) page MP56| date =[[2006-06-10]]| accessdate = 2007-02-16}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*[[Alan Eagleson]] came up with the ideal for the Canada Cup in 1966 after watching the [[FIFA World Cup]] final on TV. He said to himself, "if they can do a World Cup for soccer then why not a World Cup for hockey as well?"{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
*The 1981 win by the USSR caused controversy when Canadian officials announced that the trophy would not actually go home with the winning team. A group of Canadian fans, feeling this was unsportsmanlike, raised money to produce a duplicate trophy to give to the Soviet team.
*Every player from the USSR's 1984 Canada Cup team was a left-handed shooter.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
