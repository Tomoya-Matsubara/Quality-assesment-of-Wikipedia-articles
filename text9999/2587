The A1 motorway was originally designed in early 1970s, albeit along a different route than the present Zagreb<U+2013>Split motorway route. After suppression of the [[Croatian Spring]] and removal of the Croatian leadership that proposed and adopted the construction plan in 1971, all the work related to the Zagreb<U+2013>Split motorway was cancelled. The plans were revived in the 1990s and new designs were developed to include a motorway section built between Zagreb and Karlovac into the design so that the section could be shared between Zagreb<U+2013>Split and Zagreb<U+2013>Rijeka motorways. Construction work started in 2000 and the motorway reached Split by 2005 and was extended towards Dubrovnik later on. Both in the 1970s and in 2000s, construction of the Zagreb<U+2013>Split motorway was perceived to symbolize rebuilding of national unity.<ref name="kraljatomislava"/><ref name="Newsweek-A1"/>

The Zagreb<U+2013>Split motorway, now the A1 motorway, was one of three routes defined by the Parliament of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]] on March 5, 1971, as priority transport routes of [[Croatia]] that were to be developed as motorways. Originally the motorway was designed to follow a route from Zagreb to [[Biha<U+0107>]] ([[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]) and then to Split via [[Knin]]. The government of Bosnia and Herzegovina issued its approval for the route in Biha<U+0107> region in the same year. Construction of the motorway was initiated by a fundraising effort&nbsp;<U+2014> a public loan. The funds gathered initially through the public loan were sufficient for construction of {{convert|20|km|abbr=off}} of the motorway.<ref name="kraljatomislava"/>

The {{convert|39.3|km|adj=on}} long Zagreb<U+2013>Karlovac section of the Zagreb<U+2013>Rijeka motorway, now part of the A1 motorway, was completed in 1972. Further construction of motorways from Zagreb to Rijeka and Split was suspended for the next 28 years following a political decision of the Croatian leadership, newly installed during Yugoslav suppression of the Croatian Spring, to "stop megalomaniac projects".<ref name="kraljatomislava"/> It is considered that the true reason for the cancellation of the works was that the motorway was considered to be a "nationalist" project.<ref name="Nacional-A1-2005"/> The conclusion is supported by the fact the road was spontaneously nicknamed ''[[King Tomislav]] Motorway'' ({{lang-hr|Autocesta kralja Tomislava}}) by citizens investing their money through the public loan after the first king of [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|medieval Croatia]], who united Croatia as a single kingdom in 925. The funds raised through the public loan were left unused for several months, then spent for construction of a road between [[Vrlika]] and [[Strmica, Croatia|Strmica]] via Knin, currently a part of the D1 and [[D30 (Croatia)|D30]] state roads.<ref name="kraljatomislava"/><ref name="NN-klasifikacija"/> However, the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] recognized the route as the southernmost part of the [[Pyhrn Autobahn|Pyhrn route]], giving it the designation E59 in 1975.<ref name="UNECE-Enetwork">{{cite web | publisher= [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] | url=http://www.unece.org/trans/conventn/ECE-TRANS-SC1-384e.pdf | title=European Agreement on Main International Traffic Arteries | date=March 13, 2008 | format=PDF | accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref>

In the beginning of the 1990s, construction of the motorway was further postponed because of onset of the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. The decade saw renewed discussion regarding construction of the motorway, including renewed considerations of its route. Soon, the originally devised route running through Biha<U+0107> was set aside and two new routes were considered: One of them was a modified version of the original route, bypassing Biha<U+0107> and running through the Plitvice Lakes region while the other was a completely new route further to the west via Gospi<U+0107> and Zadar, which was eventually accepted for construction. Both of the alternative routes proposed that the Zagreb<U+2013>Karlovac motorway already completed in 1972 were to be used as the northernmost section of the Zagreb<U+2013>Split and Zagreb<U+2013>Rijeka motorways.<ref name="A1-Milicic">{{cite news | newspaper = Gra<U+0111>evinar | language = Croatian | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/20041 | title= Prikaz studije opravdanosti brze ceste Dubrovnik&nbsp;<U+2014>Zagreb | trans_title = Review of Zagreb&nbsp;<U+2014> Dubrovnik expressway feasibility study | author=Jak<U+0161>a Mili<U+010D>i<U+0107> | date = August 31, 2000 | accessdate = September 6, 2010}}</ref><ref name="A1-<U+0110>ukan">{{cite news | newspaper = Gra<U+0111>evinar | language = Croatian | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/20039 | title= Osvrt na "Studiju opravdanosti brze ceste Dubrovnik&nbsp;<U+2014> Zagreb" | trans_title = A review of the "Zagreb&nbsp;<U+2014> Dubrovnik expressway feasibility study" | author=Petar <U+0110>ukan | date = September 28, 2000 | accessdate = September 6, 2010}}</ref><ref name="SD-A1-trasa">{{cite news | newspaper = Slobodna Dalmacija | language = Croatian | url = http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20000518/novosti3.htm | title= Ugovor s Bechtelom je kona<U+010D>an: brza cesta definitivno otpada! | trans_title = Bechtel contract final: Expressway definitely cancelled | author=S.

===Construction cost===

The construction cost for the Bosiljevo&nbsp;2&ndash;Split (Dugopolje interchange) sector of the motorway was originally estimated by the government in 2001 and presented as "3 x 3 x 3" - that is, the {{convert|300|km|abbr=off}} of the motorway was to be completed in 3 years at a cost of 3 billion [[German mark|mark]]s (approximately 12.65 billion kuna at the time, or approximately 1.533 billion [[euro]]s).<ref name="HRT-cost-KA-ST">{{cite web | publisher = Croatian Radiotelevision | language = Croatian | url = http://www.hrt.hr/arhiv/2003/05/11/HRT0018.html | title= Izgradnja autoceste Zagreb&nbsp;<U+2014> Split prema planu | trans_title = Zagreb&nbsp;<U+2014> Split motorway construction proceeds as planned | date = May 11, 2003 | accessdate = September 6, 2010}}</ref> In 2010, [[Hrvatske autoceste]] reported that the average cost of one kilometer of Bosiljevo<U+2013>Split motorway was 7.1 million euro, which would mean that the total construction cost was 2.21 billion euro for that {{convert|311.4|km|abbr=off}} long segment.<ref name="Nacional-cost-KA-ST"/>

Construction cost incurred on the Dugopolje<U+2013>Plo<U+010D>e sector of the motorway between 2005 and 2008 was reported at 4.1 billion kuna and additional 1.8 billion kuna of construction expenses are planned until the end of 2012 (representing approximately 560 and 245 million euro, respectively). The latter figure includes construction of the [[D425 (Croatia)|D425 state road]] but it does not include full completion of the Vrgorac<U+2013>Plo<U+010D>e section.<ref name="HUKA-constructionplan-09-12"/>

== Traffic volume ==
[[Image:Croatia A1 trafficvolume.gif|right|thumb|alt=Bar graph of 2009 A1 traffic volume counting data.|Traffic volume measured on the A1 motorway (2009)]]Traffic is regularly counted by means of traffic census at toll stations and reported by Autocesta Rijeka&ndash;Zagreb and Hrvatske autoceste&mdash;the operators of the northern and the southern portions of the motorway respectively. The reported traffic volume gradually decreases as the motorway [[chainage]] increases and as it passes by various major destinations and the interchanges that serve them. Thus the greatest volume of traffic is registered between Jastrebarsko and Lu<U+010D>ko interchanges - with 31,432 vehicle [[Annual average daily traffic|annual average daily traffic (AADT)]], and 53,216 vehicle [[Annual average daily traffic#Average summer daily traffic|average summer daily traffic (ASDT)]] figures as that is the section closest to Zagreb. South of the Bosiljevo&nbsp;2 interchange the first major drop of traffic volume is recorded on the A1 motorway, due to traffic transferring to the A6 motorway towards Rijeka. Other similar changes of the traffic volume are registered near Zadar (served by Zadar&nbsp;1 and Zadar&nbsp;2 interchanges) and Split served by Dugopolje interchange. Substantial variations observed between AADT and ASDT are normally attributed to the fact that the motorway carries significant tourist traffic. The seasonal increase traffic volume variations ranges 69% on the busiest, Lu<U+010D>ko&ndash;Jastrebarsko section to 160% as measured on Sveti Rok&ndash;Maslenica section. The summer season traffic volume increase on the motorway is 120%.<ref name="HC-promet">{{cite web | publisher = [[Hrvatske ceste]] | url = http://www.hrvatske-ceste.hr/WEB%20-%20Legislativa/brojenje-prometa/CroDig2009.pdf | title = Traffic counting on the roadways of Croatia in 2009 - digest | date = May 1, 2010 | format=PDF | accessdate = September 6, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Roads-tourism"/>

As of September 2010, there are 26 rest areas operating along the A1 motorway,<ref name="ARZ-Restareas"/> and additional rest areas are planned along the existing sections of the route and those sections currently under construction. Legislation provides for four types of rest areas designated as types A through D&mdash;A-type rest areas comprise a full range of amenities including a [[filling station]], a [[restaurant]] and a [[hotel]] or a [[motel]]; B-type rest areas have no lodging; C-type rest areas are very common and include a filling station and a [[caf<U+00E9>]], but no restaurants or accomodations; D-type rest areas offer parking spaces only, possibly some picnicking tables and benches and restrooms.<ref name="HAC-Categories">{{cite web | publisher = Hrvatske autoceste | url = http://www.hac.hr/index.php?task=odm&stask=1 | title= Basic types and offer of roadside service facilities | accessdate = September 26, 2010}}</ref> Even though the rest areas found along the A1 motorway generally follow this ranking system, there are considerable variations as some of them offer extra services. The most notable example is Krka rest area&mdash;even though it has no filling station, there is, for instance, a restaurant available. The filling stations regularly have small [[convenience stores]] and some of them offer [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG fuel]]. EuroTest, an international association of 18 European automobile clubs spearheaded by German automobile club [[ADAC]], surveyed three of the A1 motorway rest areas in 2009: Krka, Li<U+010D>ki Osik and Modru<U+0161> (in case of the latter, both eastbound and westbound). All of the rest areas were rated as very good, especially in terms of facilities offered.<ref name="Eurotest-Restareas2009">{{cite web | publisher = EuroTest | url = http://www.eurotestmobility.com/eurotest.php?itemno=325&lang=EN | title= EuroTests - EuroTest 2009 - Motorway Rest Areas | accessdate = September 26, 2010}}</ref><ref name="SD-Eurotest">{{cite news | newspaper = Slobodna Dalmacija | url = http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/%C5%A0ibenik/tabid/74/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/71231/Default.aspx | language= Croatian | author= Ivica Marasovi<U+0107> | title= Priznanje odmori<U+0161>tu Krka, ocjena izvrstan | trans_title= An award for Krka rest area, rated excellent | date= September 22, 2009 | accessdate = September 26, 2010}}</ref>

The primary motorway operators Hrvatske autoceste (HAC) and Autocesta Rijeka&nbsp;&ndash; Zagreb lease the A, B and C type rest areas to various operators through public tenders. As of September 2010, there are five such rest area operators on the A1 motorway: [[INA (company)|INA]], [[OMV]], [[Tifon]], [[Petrol d.d.|Petrol]] and Crobenz. The rest area operators are not permitted to sub-lease the fuel operations; Tifon and Petrol operated rest areas have restaurants or hotels operated by [[March<U+00E9> (M<U+00F6>venpick)|March<U+00E9>]], a [[M<U+00F6>venpick Hotels & Resorts]] subsidiary. All of the A1 motorway rest areas, except Stupnik and Jezerane, are accessible to both directions of the motorway traffic. The rest areas normally operate operate 24&nbsp;hours a day, 7&nbsp;days a week.<ref name="ARZ-Restareas"/><ref name="HAC-Restareas"/>
