The '''Quincy Dredge Number Two''' (previously known as the '''Calumet and Hecla Dredge Number One''') is a dredge currently sunk in shallow water in [[Torch Lake (Houghton County, Michigan)|Torch Lake]], across [[M-26 (Michigan highway)|M-26]] from the [[Quincy Mining Company Stamp Mills Historic District]] and just east of [[Mason, Houghton County, Michigan|Mason]] in [[Osceola Township, Houghton County, Michigan|Osceola Township]].<ref name = "guide">{{cite web |title= A Guide to Michigan's Historic Keweenaw Copper District |first= Lawrence J. |last= Molloy |year= 2001 | url = http://www.exploringthenorth.com/coppertrips/roadtrip.html | accessdate = November 25, 2010}}</ref>  It was constructed to reclaim [[Stamp sand|stamping sand]] from the lake for further processing, and was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1978.<ref name = "state">{{cite web |url= http://www.mcgi.state.mi.us/hso/sites/5950.htm |title= Calumet and Hecla/Quincy Reclaiming Sand Dredge |publisher= Michigan State Housing Development Authority |work= Historic Sites Online|accessdate= November 20, 2010}}</ref>

The Reclaiming Sand Dredge was constructed for the [[Calumet and Hecla Mining Company]] in 1914 by the [[Bucyrus International|Bucyrus Company]] of [[South Milwaukee, Wisconsin]],<ref name = "eandm">{{cite journal |title= The Calumet & Hecla Dredge |first= L.

Calumet and Hecla used the dredge at their Lake Linden Reclamation Plant until 1951.<ref name = "guide"/>  In 1951, the [[Quincy Mine]] purchased the dredge and designated it as their Quincy Dredge Number Two, using it at their own reclamation facility,<ref name = "guide"/><ref name = "kfg"/> which had been in operation since 1943.<ref name = "haer264">{{cite book |year= c. 1968 |title= Quincy Mining Company, Hancock, Houghton, MI, HAER MI-2 |first= Charles K. |last= Hyde |chapter= An Economic and Business History of the Quincy Mining Company |page= 264 |publisher= Historic American Buildings Survey/Historic American Engineering Record/Historic American Landscapes Survey |url= http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=pphhdatapage&fileName=mi/mi0000/mi0086/data/hhdatapage.db&recNum=266}}</ref>  The mine's Quincy Dredge Number One sank in 1956, and Dredge Number Two was used until 1967,<ref name = "guide"/> when it too sank during a winter lay-up.<ref name = "kfg"/>  By this time, copper prices had fallen low enough that the reclamation process was not profitable, and the Quincy Mine abandoned both the dredge and its reclamation facility.<ref name = "kfg"/>

==Description==
The dredge is a large, box-like vessel that was used to remove sand from the bottom of the lake.<ref name = "guide"/> The vessel has a steel hull measuring {{convert|110|ft|m}} long, {{convert|56|ft|m}} wide, and {{convert/spell|9|ft|m}} deep.<ref name = "eandm"/>  The decking overhangs the hull by {{convert/spell|8|ft|m}} per side, giving an overall width of {{convert|72|ft|m}}.<ref name = "eandm"/>  The dredge could process over {{convert|10000| ST|t}} of sand per day, and had a {{convert|141|ft|m|adj=on}} suction pipe that could work in {{convert|115|ft|m}} of water.<ref name = "guide"/>

The dredge is currently sunk in shallow water, and canted over to one side.<ref name = "kfg"/>  Most of the superstructure and the large boom are visible above the waterline.<ref name = "kfg"/>
