'''Georg Bochmann''', (born 18 September 1913 in [[Zschorlau|Albernau]]; died 8 June 1973 in [[Offenbach am Main]]) was an SS-[[Oberf<U+00FC>hrer]] of the [[Waffen-SS]]. He was also a recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]]. He served in the [[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich]], the [[3rd SS Division Totenkopf]], the [[9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen]], the [[17th SS Panzergrenadier Division G<U+00F6>tz von Berlichingen]] and the [[18th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Horst Wessel]].

==Early career==

Georg Bochmann was born in [[Zschorlau|Albernau]], in the [[Erzgebirge]] region of [[Saxony]] on the border with [[Bohemia]]. His family were textile workers of modest means. He studied at the [[University of Leipzig]]. After joining the [[Hitler Youth]], Bochmann joined the [[Nazi party]] in 1933 (Membership Number : 1907565) and the [[SS]] [[Totenkopf]] the following year (Membership Number : 122362), working at the [[Dachau]] concentration camp for political prisoners. In 1936 he was promoted [[SS]] [[Untersturmf<U+00FC>hrer]] (Second Lieutenant), and appointed to the "SS-Totenkopf Standarte ''Oberbayern''".

==World War II==

In November 1939 he was appointed SS [[Obersturmf<U+00FC>hrer]] (First Lieutenant) and "was a prime mover in the creation and outfitting of the SS Totenkopf Division, 1939-1940."<ref name="Christopher Ailsby 1997 page.17">Christopher Ailsby, ''SS: Roll of Infamy'' ISBN 1-897884-22-2 (1997), page.17.</ref> In 1940 he assumed command of an armoured unit within the [[3rd SS Division Totenkopf]] and during the French campaign the Division fought at [[Cambrai]], [[Arras]], [[Dunkirk]], and participated in deep thrusts into southwestern [[France]]. For his successes Bochmann received the [[Iron Cross]], second class. A little later he was promoted to SS [[Hauptsturmf<U+00FC>hrer]] (Captain). The [[3rd SS Division Totenkopf]] remained in France until April 1941 when it was transferred east to prepare for [[Operation Barbarossa]].

On the eastern front the [[3rd SS Division Totenkopf]] fought as part of the German ''Army Group "North"''. Bochmann fought in the Baltic to [[Leningrad]] (now [[St. Petersburg]]) and was cited for his performances at [[Kaunas]] and [[D<U+00FC>naburg]] (now Daugavpils) in [[Latvia]]. In July 1941 Bochmann received the [[Iron Cross]], first class, and in August 1941 the [[3rd SS Division Totenkopf]] reached Ilmen lake.

In January 1942 [[3rd SS Division Totenkopf]] was formally transferred to the German ''Second Army Corps'' and during the [[Soviet]] winter offensive there was a particularly savage battle at [[Demyansk]]. Nearly 100,000 German soldiers were surrounded for three months and were mostly supplied by [[Luftwaffe]] air drops. For his exceptional merit, tenacity and leadership, Bochmann was awarded the Knight's Cross. A little after that he received the famous [[Demyansk Shield]]. On 2 April 1942 Bochmann was promoted to SS [[Sturmbannf<U+00FC>hrer]] (Major).

On 21 October 1942 Bochmann was appointed commander of the 2nd Motorised Battalion of the Regiment "Thule" (within the [[3rd SS Division Totenkopf]]). In late October the entire division was withdrawn from the eastern front and sent to [[France]] for rest and recuperation. After returning to the eastern front, Bochmann assumed command of the 3rd Motorised Battalion and participated in the battles for [[Kharkov]], Sorokovka and Tetlega. For his valiant successes in these struggles he was awarded on 17 May 1943 with the Oak Leaves to Knight's Cross. He was the 246th recipient and was awarded by [[Hitler]] in person.

Later Bochmann was appointed to command a tank regiment in the division and on 9 November 1943 he was promoted SS-[[Obersturmbannf<U+00FC>hrer]] (Lieutenant Colonel). Following fresh injuries he was withdrawn from the front and sent home. In [[Germany]] he was appointed head of [[SS]] Officer's School for Administration in [[Arolsen]], [[Hesse]]. On 9 November 1944 he was promoted to SS-[[Standartenf<U+00FC>hrer]] and transferred to [[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich]]. However after only a few weeks he was hastily transferred to command the 9th SS armored regiment in the [[9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen]] on 20 November.

Bochmann actually only returned to combat on 2 January 1945 when he was appointed commander of the [[18th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Horst Wessel]]. After a brief stint fighting in the west, the division was moved to the eastern front, where it was decimated and quickly surrounded by the [[Red Army]] in Oberglogau, [[Silesia]]. Although wounded, Bochmann led a successful breakthrough and was awarded the Swords to the Knights Cross (becoming the 140th recipient), Oak Leaves and the prestigious [[Wound Badge]] in Gold. Also he was promoted to SS-[[Oberf<U+00FC>hrer]] on 20 April 1945.<ref name="Christopher Ailsby 1997 page.17"/>

With only a few weeks of war left Bochmann was appointed commander of the [[17th SS Panzergrenadier Division G<U+00F6>tz von Berlichingen]]. After retreating through [[Bavaria]] he refused suicidal orders from [[Generalfeldmarschall]] [[Ferdinand Sch<U+00F6>rner]] to attack Allied troops, was dismissed from his post and plans were started to court martial him.<ref>Gerald Reitlinger, ''The SS : Alibi of a Nation 1922-1945'' (1981), page.87.</ref>

On 9 May 1945 Georg Bochmann surrendered to [[United States]] troops in the [[Rottach-Egern]] region.
