'''Judicial activism''' is a critical term used to describe [[judiciary|judicial]] rulings that impose a personal biased interpretation by a given court of what a law means as opposed to what a neutral, unbiased observer would naturally interpret a law to mean.

==Definition==
The term "judicial activism" is frequently used in political debate without definition, which has created some confusion over its precise meaning or meanings.  In an effort to clarify the situation, Bradley C. Canon has identified six dimensions along which judges or courts may be perceived as activist:<ref>ibid., p.239</ref>

1. '''Majoritarianism'''- This dimension takes into account the degree to which policies adopted through the democratic process are judicially overturned. <br>
2. '''Interpretive stability'''- This dimension takes into account the degree to which court decisions alter earlier decisions, doctrines, or constitutional interpretations. <br>
3. '''Interpretive fidelity'''- This dimension takes into account the degree to which constitutional provisions are interpreted contrary to the clear intentions of their drafters, or the clear implications of the language used in the provision. (See also [[Judicial interpretation]]) <br>
4. '''Substance/democratic process'''- This dimension takes into account the degree to which judicial decisions make substantive policy, as opposed to acting to preserve the democratic political process. <br>
5. '''Specificity of policy'''- This dimension takes into account the degree to which a judicial decision establishes policy itself, as opposed to leaving discretion to other agencies. <br>
6. '''Availability of an alternate policymaker'''- This dimension takes into account the degree to which a judicial decision supersedes or inhibits serious consideration of the same problem by other government agencies.

==Debate==
Detractors of judicial activism charge that it usurps the power of the elected branches of government or appointed agencies , thereby damaging the rule of law and democracy.<ref>See, for example, Justice [[Antonin Scalia]]'s dissent in [[Romer v. Evans]][http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-1039.ZD.html]</ref>  They argue that an unelected or elected judicial branch has no legitimate grounds to overrule policy choices of duly elected or appointed representatives, in the absence of a real conflict with the constitution.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} In some instances, government regulation by appointed officers in government agencies are overturned by elected judges.  

Defenders of judicial prerogatives say that many cases of so called "judicial activism" merely exemplify [[judicial review]], and that courts must uphold existing laws and strike down any statute that violates a higher law.{{Fact|date=January 2009}} They say that it is the duty of courts to protect minority rights and to uphold the law, notwithstanding the political sentiments of the day, and that constitutional democracy is far more than just transient majority rule.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} It is common for the charge to arise simply because one disagree with a certain ruling regardless of were the majority at the moment stands.  However, detractors of judicial activism retort that neither democracy nor the rule of law can exist when the law is merely what judges presently say it should be.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Defenders counterclaim that indeed this is precisely what the role of the [[judiciary]] is , namely to interpret the law.  Detractors argue that the discretion of judges must be limited e.g. by the intentions of lawmakers and appointed or elected government officers , or else any group of people engaged in any behavior could become a judicially protected minority, and any law could be subverted by the predilections of elected or appointed judges.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Some proponents of a stronger judiciary argue that the judiciary helps provide checks and balances and should grant itself an expanded role to counterbalance the effects of transient [[majoritarianism]], i.e. there should be an increase in the powers of a branch of government which is not directly subject to the electorate, so that the majority cannot dominate or oppress any particular minority through its elective powers.<ref>John Hart Ely, ''Democracy and Distrust''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1980, chapters 4-6.</ref> Moreover, they argue that the judiciary strikes down both elected and unelected official action, that in some instances acts of legislative bodies reflect the view the transient majority may have had at the moment of passage and not necessarily the view the same legislative body may have at the time the legislation is struck down, that the judges that are appointed are usually appointed by previously elected executive officials so that their philosophy should reflect that of those who nominated them, that an independent judiciary is a great asset to civil society since corporations and the wealthy are unable to dictate their version of constitutional interpretation with threat of stopping political donations.

==Origins==
[[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] introduced the term "judicial activism" to the public in a January 1947 [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]] article titled "The Supreme Court: 1947."<ref>Keenan Kmiec in a 2004 California Law Review article</ref> According to Keenan Kmiec, in a 2004 article in ''California Law Review'',
{{cquote|Schlesinger's article profiled all nine Supreme Court justices on the Court at that time and explained the alliances and divisions among them. The article characterized Justices [[Hugo Black|Black]], [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]], [[Frank Murphy|Murphy]], and [[Wiley Blount Rutledge|Rutledge]] as the "Judicial Activists" and Justices [[Felix Frankfurter|Frankfurter]], [[Robert H. Jackson|Jackson]], and [[Harold Hitz Burton|Burton]] as the "Champions of Self Restraint." Justice [[Stanley Forman Reed|Reed]] and Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson|Vinson]] comprised a middle group.<ref>Keenan D. Kmiec, The Origin and Current Meanings of "Judicial Activism," 92 Cal. L. Rev. 1441, 1447 (2004).[http://www.constitution.org/lrev/kmiec/judicial_activism.htm]</ref>

==Accusations of judicial activism==
{{Weasel|date=January 2009}}

===The Living Constitution as judicial activism===
In the U.S., critics{{Who|date=November 2007}} of the concept of a [[living Constitution]] approach to judicial philosophy argue it is necessarily activist. They argue that the concept endorses any ruling, so long as the judge can argue that it helps the Constitution to grow and evolve. Critics{{Who|date=November 2007}} say that this can violate a judge's sworn allegiance to uphold the Constitution, because, in effect, it encourages judges to write their own Constitutions. Furthermore, they argue that the concept leads to unpredictable rulings, making it impossible to obey the law (as one cannot determine what the law will be before one acts.) One possible outcome of this confusion is the threat of [[frivolous lawsuit]]s. <ref>[http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/ts20050310.shtml Townhall.com]</ref>

Critics{{Who|date=November 2007}} of the concept also argue that it violates the principle of [[separation of powers]]. They say that because the purpose of the judiciary is to interpret existing laws and policies, any action that is not done strictly in accordance with existing law must be activism. Indeed, they continue, the legislative branch is explicitly empowered by the Constitution to make law, and the Constitution deliberately has an amendment process (involving the legislature and not the judiciary.) Consequently, any change to the laws or the Constitution outside this framework is itself illegal.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}


==Judicial Activism in the European Union==
{{main|Judicial activism in the European Union}}

The [[European Court of Justice]] has historically been an important driver of [[integration in the EU]] by performing judicial activism.<ref> Bache, Ian and Stephen George (2006). Politics in the European Union, 2nd ed., Oxford: Oxford University Press</ref>


In the [[Cassis de Dijon Case]] the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled the German laws prohibiting sales of liquors with alcohol percentages between 15% and 25% conflicted with [[EU laws]]. This ruling confirmed that [[EU law]] has [[primacy]] over [[Member-State]] law.<ref>EUabc <U+2013> Cassis de Djion case: http://en.euabc.com/word/140</ref>
When the [[treaties]] are unclear it leaves room for the Court to interpret it in different ways. When [[EU treaties]] are negotiated it is difficult to get all governments to agree on a clear set of laws. In order to compromise governments agree to leave a decision on an issue to the Court.<ref> Bache, Ian and Stephen George (2006). Politics in the European Union, 2nd ed., Oxford: Oxford University Press</ref>
The Court can only practice [[judicial activism]] to the extent the EU Governments leave room for interpretation in the [[treaties]].<ref>Moravcsik, A. (2002) <U+2018>In defense of the democratic deficit: reassessing legitimacy in the European Union<U+2019> Journal of Common Market Studies. Vol 40, Issue 4 </ref>
The Court makes important rulings that set the agenda for further [[EU integration]], but it cannot happen without the consensual support of the [[Member-States]].<ref>Moravcsik, A. (2002) <U+2018>In defense of the democratic deficit: reassessing legitimacy in the European Union<U+2019> Journal of Common Market Studies. Vol 40, Issue 4 </ref>
The most recent case of [[judicial activism]] of the [[European Court of Justice]] is the [[Metock case]] which determined that the strict [[Danish]] and [[Irish immigration laws]] conflict with [[EU laws]].<ref>Article: Metock case brings down Danish immigration laws http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/3457</ref>


In the [[Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty]] many issues not directly related to the treaty, such as[[ Abortion]] were included in the debate, because of worries that the [[Lisbon Treaty]] will enable the [[European Court of Justice]] to make activist rulings in these areas.
After the rejection of the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in Ireland, the [[Irish Government]] received concessions from the rest of the [[EU countries]] to make written guarantees that the EU will under no circumstances interfere with Irish abortion, taxation or military neutrality.<ref>Irish secure concessions on Lisbon Treaty: http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2008/12/irish-secure-concessions-on-lisbon-treaty/63409.aspx</ref>
[[Ireland]] will possibly vote a second time on the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in 2009.
