'''Martin Lass''' (born 1958) is an American [[violin]]ist and [[astrologer]], who has spent many years in Australia.

==Career==

===Violinist===
Martin Lass was born in [[Chicago]] in 1958. His mother was of Hungarian ancestry, and claimed she had some Romany blood. He became interested in the violin at the age of 8, when he saw a television documentary about [[Yehudi Menuhin]]. His family migrated to [[Australia]] when he was 11. He studied at the [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music]], then joined the [[Australian Chamber Orchestra]] for four years. He also played with the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]] and the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra.

Lass's desire for a solo career led him to [[Bert Newton]]'s ''[[New Faces (Australian talent show)|New Faces]]'' in 1982, winning the Grand Final and People Choice awards. Then a touring career ensued, in which he combined classical, gypsy and popular genres including jazz, bluegrass and Celtic. He has also written much original material. He appeared as the Fiddler in two seasons of ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' in Sydney.

He was a frequent television performer, and also supported major stars such as [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Julio Iglesias]] and [[Joan Baez]]. He won the [[Mo Awards|Mo Award for Instrumental Excellence]] seven years running (1984<U+2013>90) and was voted the [[Variety Club]] Artist of the Year 1990. He recorded 10 CDs and sold over 250,000 albums.

He returned to the United States for ten years, but has returned to Australia.<ref name=living>[http://www.livingnow.com.au/cwe/showcase/145-martin-lass-martin-lass Living Now]</ref>
