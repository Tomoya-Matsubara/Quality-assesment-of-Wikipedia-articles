'''''Alien vs. Predator''''' (also known as '''''AVP''''') is a [[science fiction film]] released in 2004 by [[20th Century Fox]]. It is an adaptation of a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] [[Alien vs. Predator series|franchise]]  between the titular extraterrestrials from the ''[[Alien (film series)|Alien]]'' and ''[[Predator (film series)|Predator]]'' series, a concept which originated in a [[Aliens versus Predator (comic book)|1989 comic book]]. An ''Alien Vs. Predator'' film was put on hiatus until 2002, with the final production based on an original [[screenplay]] by director [[Paul W. S. Anderson]] and [[Shane Salerno]], who were influenced by [[Aztec mythology]], the comic book series, and the writings of [[Erich von D<U+00E4>niken]].

Set in 2004, ''Alien vs. Predator'' follows a group of [[paleontologists]], [[archaeologists]], and others assembled by billionaire Charles Bishop Weyland ([[Lance Henriksen]]) for an expedition near the Antarctic after discovering a mysterious heat signal. Hoping to claim the find for himself, Weyland and the group discover a pyramid below the surface of a whaling station. [[Hieroglyphics]] and sculptures reveal that the pyramid is a hunting ground for [[Predator (alien)|Predators]] who kill [[Xenomorph (Alien)|Aliens]] as a "[[coming of age]]" ritual. The humans are caught in the middle of a battle between the two species and attempt to prevent the Aliens reaching the surface.

Released on [[August 13]], [[2004]] in North America, ''Alien vs. Predator'' received negative reviews from film critics, scoring a 22% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], and 29 on [[Metacritic]]. Some critics praised the special effects and set designs, while others dismissed the film for its "wooden dialogue", and "cardboard characters". ''Alien vs. Predator'' became the most commercially successful film in the franchises, grossing a total of [[US$|$]]171 million. The film's success led to a sequel in 2007 titled ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]''.

==Plot==
In 2004, a satellite detects a mysterious heat bloom beneath the island [[Bouvet Island|Bouvet<U+00F8>ya]] near [[Antarctica]]. Billionaire [[Charles Bishop Weyland]] ([[Lance Henriksen]]) assembles a team of scientists to investigate the heat source and claim it for his multinational communications company Weyland Industries (foreshadowing the [[Weyland-Yutani|Weyland-Yutani Corporation]] of the ''Alien'' film series). The team includes [[paleontologists]], [[archaeologists]], linguistic experts, drillers, mercenaries, and a female guide named Alexa Woods ([[Sanaa Lathan]]).

As a [[Predator (alien)|Predator]] ship reaches Earth's orbit, it blasts a hole through the ice towards the source of the heat bloom. When the humans arrive at the site above the heat source, an abandoned [[Whaling|whaling station]], they find this hole and descend beneath the ice. They discover a mysterious [[pyramid]] and begin to explore it, finding evidence of a civilization predating written history and what appears to be a sacrificial chamber filled with human skeletons with ruptured [[Human rib cage|rib cages]]. 

Meanwhile, three Predators land and kill the humans on the surface, making their way down to the pyramid and arrive just as the team unwittingly powers up the structure. An [[Xenomorph (Alien)|Alien]] queen awakens from [[Cryopreservation|cryogenic stasis]] and begins to produce eggs, from which [[Xenomorph (Alien)#Facehugger|facehuggers]] hatch and attach to several humans trapped in the sacrificial chamber. [[Xenomorph (Alien)#Chestburster|Chestbursters]] emerge from the humans and quickly grow into adult Aliens. Conflicts erupt between the Predators, Aliens, and humans, resulting in several deaths. Unknown to the others, a Predator is implanted with an Alien embryo.

Through translation of the pyramid<U+2019>s [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] the explorers learn that the Predators have been visiting Earth for thousands of years. It was they who taught early human civilizations how to build pyramids, and were worshipped as gods. Every 100 years they would visit Earth to take part in a [[rite of passage]] in which several humans would sacrifice themselves as hosts for the Aliens, creating the "ultimate prey" for the Predators to hunt. If overwhelmed, the Predators would activate their self-destruct weapons to eliminate the Aliens and themselves. The explorers deduce that this is why the current Predators are at the pyramid, and that the heat bloom was to attract humans for the purpose of making new Aliens to hunt. 

The remaining humans decide that the Predators must be allowed to succeed in their hunt so the Aliens do not reach the surface. As the battle continues, most characters are killed leaving Alexa and a single Predator to fight against the Aliens. The two form an alliance and use the Predator<U+2019>s self-destruct device to destroy the pyramid and the remaining Aliens. Alexa and the Predator reach the surface, where they battle the escaped Alien queen. They defeat the queen by attaching its chain to a water tower pushing it over a cliff and into the ocean, dragging the queen to the ocean floor. The Predator, however, dies from its wounds. 

A Predator ship [[cloaking device|uncloaks]] and several Predators appear. They collect their fallen comrade and present Alexa with one of their spear weapons in recognition of her skill as a warrior. As they retreat into space, a chestburster erupts from the dead Predator. It appears to be an Alien/Predator hybrid, as it has the characteristic [[mandible]]s of the two creatures.

==Cast==
*'''[[Sanaa Lathan]]''' as '''Alexa Woods''', the film's chief protagonist. Alexa is an experienced guide who spent several seasons exploring the Arctic and Antarctic environments.

==Production==
===Origins===
The concept of ''Alien vs. Predator'' originated from the ''[[Aliens versus Predator (comic book)|Aliens versus Predator]]'' comic book in 1989, and was hinted at when an Alien skull appeared in a trophy case aboard the Predator ship in ''[[Predator 2]]''.<ref name="briggs">''Cinescape Presents v3 #9'', ''Movie Aliens''</ref> Screenwriter [[Peter Briggs]] created the original [[Screenplays#Spec scripts|spec screenplay]] in 1990<U+2013>1991, which was based on the first comic series.<ref name="briggs" /> In 1991, he successfully pitched the concept to 20th Century Fox, who owned the film franchises, although the company did not move forward with the project until 2002. A draft penned by James DeMonaco and Kevin Fox was rejected by producer [[John Davis (American producer)|John Davis]], who hoped to give the film an original approach by setting it on Earth.<ref name="Alien vs. Predator Still Seeking a Script">{{cite web

As there were six producers between the film franchises, Davis had difficulty securing the rights as the producers were worried about a film featuring the two creatures. [[Paul W.S. Anderson]] pitched Davis a story he worked on for eight years, and showed him concept art created by [[Randy Bowen]].<ref name="AVP Commentary">Audio commentary by [[Paul W.S.

===Story and setting===
[[Image:Alien vs. Predator (film) Predator gods.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Influenced by the work of [[Erich von D<U+00E4>niken]] and [[Aztec mythology]], Anderson had the Predators come to Earth in spaceships and teach humans how to build pyramids. As a result they were treated as gods.]]

|accessdate=2008-01-13}}</ref> Influenced by the work of [[Erich von D<U+00E4>niken]], Anderson researched D<U+00E4>niken's theories on how he believed early civilizations were able to construct massive pyramids with the help of aliens, an idea drawn from [[Aztec mythology]].<ref name="AVP featurette">{{cite web

|url=http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/avp/featurette/
|accessdate=2008-01-13}}</ref> Anderson wove these ideas into ''Alien vs. Predator'', describing a scenario in which Predators taught ancient humans to build pyramids and used Earth for "[[coming of age]]" rituals every 100 years in which they would hunt Aliens. To explain how these ancient civilizations "disappeared without a trace", Anderson came up with the idea that the Predators, if overwhelmed by the Aliens, would use their self-destruct weapons to kill everything in the area.<ref name="AVP featurette"/> [[H. P. Lovecraft|H. P. Lovecraft's]] 1931 novella ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'' served as an inspiration for the film, and several elements of the ''Alien vs. Predator'' comic series were included.<ref name="Alien: Definitive Edition">[[Twentieth Century Fox| Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation]], ''Alien: Definitive Edition'' [[DVD]]</ref><ref name="AVP Commentary"/> Anderson's initial script called for five Predators to appear in the film, although was changed to three.<ref name="AVP featurette"/>

As ''Alien vs. Predator'' is a [[sequel]] to the ''Predator'' films and [[prequel]] to the ''Alien'' series, Anderson was cautious of contradicting continuity in the franchises. He chose to set the film on the remote [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Antarctic]] island of [[Bouvet Island|Bouvet]] commenting, "It's definitely the most hostile environment on Earth and probably the closest to an Alien surface you can get."<ref name="MM"/> Anderson thought that setting the film in an urban environment like New York City would break continuity with the ''Alien'' series as the protagonist, [[Ellen Ripley]], had no knowledge the creatures existed. "You can't have an Alien running around the city now, because it would've been written up and everyone will know about it. So there's nothing in this movie that contradicts anything that already exists."<ref name="MM">Let's get ready to rumble!, ''Movie Magic'', January 2005, page 62</ref>

===Casting===
[[Image:Lance Henriksen.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Lance Henriksen was the first to be cast in ''Alien vs. Predator'' as Anderson wanted to keep continuity with the ''Alien'' series.]]
The first actor to be cast for ''Alien vs. Predator'' was [[Lance Henriksen]], who played the character [[Bishop (Alien)|Bishop]] in ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' and ''[[Alien 3]]''. Although the ''Alien'' movies are set 150 years in the future, Anderson wanted to keep continuity with the series by including a familiar actor. Henriksen plays billionaire Charles Bishop Weyland, a character that ties in with the [[Weyland-Yutani Corporation]]. According to Anderson, Weyland becomes known for the discovery of the pyramid, and as a result the Weyland-Yutani Corporation models the Bishop android in the ''Alien'' films after him; "when the Bishop android is created in 150 years time, it's created with the face of the creator. It's kind of like [[Microsoft]] building an android in 100 years time that has the face of [[Bill Gates]]."<ref name="Interview with AvP Director Paul Anderson">{{cite web

Anderson opted for a European cast including Italian actor [[Raoul Bova]], [[Ewen Bremner]] from Scotland, and English actor [[Colin Salmon]]. Producer Davis said, "There's a truly international flavor to the cast, and gives the film a lot of character."<ref name="Alien vs. Predator PN"/> Several hundred actresses attended the auditions to be cast as the film's heroine Alexa Woods. [[Sanaa Lathan]] was selected, and one week later she flew to Prague to begin filming. The filmmakers knew there would be comparisons to ''Alien'' heroine Ellen Ripley and did not want a clone of the character, but wanted to make her similar while adding something different.<ref name="Alien vs. Predator PN"/>

Anderson reported in an interview that California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was willing to reprise his role as Major Alan "Dutch" Schaeffer from ''Predator'' in a short [[cameo appearance]], on the conditions that he lose the [[California recall election, 2003|recall election]] and that the filming take place at his residence.<ref name="Exclusive: Paul Anderson on AvP">{{cite web

Actress [[Sigourney Weaver]], who starred as Ellen Ripley in the ''Alien'' series, said she was happy not to be in the film, as a possible crossover was "the reason I wanted my character to die in the first place", and thought the concept "sounded awful".<ref name="Sigourney Weaver: Loving the alien">{{cite web

===Filming and set designs===
Production began in late 2003 at [[Barrandov Studios]] in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]], where most of the filming took place. [[Production designer]] Richard Bridgland was in charge of sets, props and vehicles, based on early concept art Anderson had created to give a broad direction of how things would look. 25 to 30 life-sized sets were constructed at Barrandov Studios, many of which were interiors of the pyramid. The pyramid's carvings, sculptures, and [[hieroglyphs]] were influenced by [[Egyptian]], [[Cambodian]], and [[Aztec]] civilizations, while the regular shifting of the pyramid's rooms was meant to evoke a sense of [[claustrophobia]] similar to the original ''Alien'' film.<ref name="AVP new world vision">{{cite web
|title=''Alien vs. Predator'' A New World Vision
|publisher=Spike.com
|url=http://www.spike.com/video/2644628/collection/232/event/22474
|accessdate=2008-01-14}}</ref> According to Anderson, if he was to build the sets in [[Los Angeles]] they would have cost $20 million. However, in Prague they cost $2 million, an important factor when the film's budget was less than $50 million.<ref name="AVP Commentary"/>

Third scale [[Miniature effect|miniatures]] several meters in height were created to give the film the effect of realism, rather than relying on [[computer generated imagery]] (CGI). For the whaling station miniatures and life-sized sets, over 700 bags of [[artificial snow]] was used (roughly 15&ndash;20 tons).<ref name="AVP special features"/> A 4.5-meter miniature of an [[icebreaker]] with working lights and a mechanical moving radar was created, costing almost $37,000 and taking 10 weeks to create. Visual effects producer Arthur Windus, claimed miniatures were beneficial in the filming process: "With computer graphics, you need to spend a lot of time making it real. With a miniature, you shoot it and its there."<ref name="Local shoots shrinking "/>  A 25-meter miniature of the whaling station was created in several months. It was designed so the model could be collapsed and then reconstructed, which proved beneficial for a six-second shot which required a re-shoot.<ref name="Local shoots shrinking "/>

===Effects and creatures===
[[Image:AVPmoviefilming.PNG|A hydraulic Alien was used to film six scenes as it was faster than a man in a suit. The puppet required six people to operate it.|240px|thumb|right]]
Special effects company Amalgamated Dynamics Incorporated (ADI), was hired for the movie having previously worked on ''[[Alien 3]]'' and ''[[Alien: Resurrection]]''. Visual special effects producers Arthur Windus and [[John Bruno]] were in charge of the project, which contained 400 effects shots.<ref name="Local shoots shrinking ">{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-01-13}}</ref> ADI founders Alec Gillis, Tom Woodruff Jr., and members of their company, began designing costumes, miniatures and effects in June 2003. For five months the creatures were redesigned, the Predators wrist blades being extended roughly four times longer than those in the ''Predator'' films, and a larger mechanical plasma caster was created for the Scar Predator.<ref name="AVP special features"/> 

The basic shape of the Predator mask was kept, although technical details were added and each Predator was given a unique mask to distinguish them from each other. These masks were creating using clay, which was used to form moulds to create [[fiberglass]] copies. These copies were painted to give a weathered look, which Woodruff claims "is what the Predator is all about".<ref name="AVP special features"/> A [[Hydraulic drive system|hydraulic]] Alien puppet was created so ADI would be able to make movements faster and give the Alien a "slimline and skeletal" appearance, rather than using an actor in a suit. The puppet required six people to run it; three for the head and body, two for the arms, and a sixth to make sure the signals were reaching the computer. Movements were recorded in the computer so that puppeteers would be able to repeat moves that Anderson liked. The puppet was used in six shots, including the fight scene with the Predator which took one month to film.<ref name="AVP special features"/> 

The crew tried to keep CGI use to a minimum, as Anderson said people in suits and puppets are scarier than CGI monsters as they are "there in the frame".<ref name="AVP special features"/> Roughly 70% of  scenes were created using suits, puppets, and miniatures. The Alien queen was filmed using three variations: a 4.8-meter practical version, a 1.2-meter puppet, and a computer-generated version. The practical version required 12 puppeteers to operate,<ref name="AVP Commentary"/> and CGI tails were added to the Aliens and the queen as they were difficult to animate using puppetry.<ref name="Alien vs. Predator PN">{{cite web

A two-disc Extreme Edition was released on [[March 7]], [[2005]], which featured [[behind the scenes]] footage of conception, [[pre-production]], production, [[post-production]], and licensing the franchise. An Unrated Edition was released on [[November 22]], [[2005]], and contained the special features in the Extreme Edition, CGI blood and an extra eight minutes of footage. The extra footage contained "a few more shots of blood, gore, guts, and slime to spice things up, though, and tiny bits of connecting matter to help us follow the story line better, but none of it amounts to much", said John Puccio of DVD Town.<ref name="AVP: Alien Vs.
