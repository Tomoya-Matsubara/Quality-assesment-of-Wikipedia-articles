'''[[Religion]] in [[Croatia]]''' is chiefly [[Roman Catholic]]. During the [[1990's]] there was conflict between the [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Serbs]], the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Croats]], and the [[Muslim]] [[Bosniaks]]. This caused a massive [[civil war]] in [[Bosnia]]. The [[Croatian Constitution|constitution]] provides for [[freedom of religion]].  Approximately 5.5% of [[Croats]] self-identify as [[irreligion|non-religious]].<ref>http://www.atheism.ru/library/phil_1.phtml</ref>
Although the [[Croatian government]] requires religious teaching in [[public schools]], attendance is not mandated. There is no [[state religion]], although the [[Catholic Church]] receives public funding and other benefits.
