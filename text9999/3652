'''Stanley Park Stadium''' is a proposed title of the planned [[football (soccer)|football]] [[stadium]] to be built in [[Stanley Park, Liverpool|Stanley Park]], [[Liverpool]], [[England]].  The stadium was given planning permission in [[February]] [[2003]]. The stadium has a planned all-seated capacity of about 60,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/5327426.stm |title=Liverpool get go-ahead on stadium |work=Article on BBC Sport |date=[[September 8]], [[2006]] |accessdate=May 24|accessyear=2007}}</ref> The plans were initiated by [[Liverpool F.C.]] to replace its stadium at [[Anfield]] and were first announced in May [[2002]].<ref name=BBCSport1>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/1992484.stm |title=Liverpool unveil new stadium |work=Article on BBC Sport |date=[[May 17]], [[2002]] |accessdate=March 17|accessyear=2007}}</ref> At that time the proposed capacity was 55,000 but it was later revised to 61,000 (1,000 seats given for segregation). The club had first announced its intention of building a new stadium 18 months earlier. The original idea had been for a 70,000 seat stadium which would cost around <U+00A3>200million and be ready for the 2004-05 season.<ref name=BBCSport1/>

There were attempts by the local council to instigate a  groundshare of the stadium with local rivals [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], but this move was rejected. If the ground was to be shared, the move would not have gone down well with either set of fans. The name Stanley Park Stadium was proposed for the purpose of facilitating a groundshare but Liverpool would prefer to call the new ground New Anfield if it is solely their ground.

The plans, originally approved in February [[2005]], needed to go before [[Liverpool City Council]] for a second time some 12 months later to ensure that the proposed stadium complied with new planning regulations. It was reported on [[11 April]] [[2006]] that the plans had passed without amendment.

On 8th September 2006 [[Liverpool FC]] got the green light from the city council for development on the new 61,000 seater stadium, and were granted a 99 year lease for the site. 

==Liverpool FC Takeover Impact==

With the takeover of the club by [[George N. Gillett Jr.]] and [[Tom Hicks]] on [[February 6]] [[2007]] the building of the new stadium looks likely to begin "very soon"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,2006989,00.html |title=Liverpool accept takeover offer |work=Article in The Guardian |date=[[February 6]], [[2007]] |accessdate=March 17|accessyear=2007}}</ref> with an estimated investment of <U+00A3>215m for the first phase.  New [[stadium|football stadia]] are commonly named after a commercial sponsor - such as [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal's]] [[Emirates Stadium]] - and Liverpool's new stadium looks set to follow this course. When Gillett was asked if he would consider selling the naming rights of the stadium he answered:"If the naming rights are worth one great player a year in transfer spending, we will certainly look at that as a serious option."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/6323037.stm |title=US pair agree Liverpool takeover |work=Article on BBC Sport |date=[[February 6]], [[2007]] |accessdate=March 17|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

Development of the site is due to begin in [[May]] [[2007]] with construction beginning in [[July]] of the same year. The stadium is scheduled to be completed by the end of [[2010]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/6517517.stm |title=Reds to begin stadium work in May |work=Article by BBC News |accessdate=April 02|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

On [[March 14]] [[2007]], a possibilty of the capacity being increased to 80,000 was reported on, which would have made the stadium larger in capacity than the current largest FA stadium outside [[Wembley Stadium |Wembley]], that of Manchester United's [[Old Trafford (football ground)|Old Trafford]]. <ref>[[Radio City 96.7]]{{cite web|url=http://www.radiocity.co.uk/Article.asp?PT=News+%26+Sport&id=368511 |title=Stadium plans ripped up |work=Article by RadioCity |accessdate=March 17|accessyear=2007}}</ref> This was denied by chief executive Rick Parry, however he did hint that more seating will be considered in the review of the stadium, just not to the scale described in the press. Talks to expand to 75,000 or 80,000 seats, pushing opening to at the earliest the 2010 season, and conducting a new traffic impact study were rumored. News broke on [[April 2]] [[2007]], that Liverpool had permission from the council to start work, and work is now due to begin in May with a completion date of 2009.
