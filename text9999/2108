'''William Owen''' (1769- 1825) was an English society [[portrait]] painter working in [[London]].
William Owen was born at 13 Broad Street, [[Ludlow]], Shropshire in 1769 and was baptized on 3rd November in Ludlow Parish Church. Owen<U+2019>s father, Jeremiah Owen, had trained for the church but instead chose to follow in his father<U+2019>s profession and took over the family barber shop which he later expanded into a stationary and bookshop. Owen found his talent at a young age, and would frequently be found sketching the scenery of his surrounding area, his first work being a drawing of Ludlow castle which is thought to have been given to Margaret Maskelyne, Lady Clive (1735-1817). <ref> The Annual Biography and Obituary, vol.X, 1826, p.359.</ref>

== Career ==

Owen moved to [[London]] in 1786 where he was apprenticed to the coach painter Charles Cotton RA (1728-1798).This was most likely arranged by his uncle who was a butler for the scholar and theorist [[Richard Payne Knight]] (1750-1824) who lived near Ludlow.  It appears that Owen was drawn to figure painting from the outset, and after copying a portrait by [[Sir Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792]]) of the much admired actress [[Mary Robinson]] (c.1757-1800)(better known as <U+2018>Perdita<U+2019>), <ref> Almost certainly <U+2018>Portrait of Mrs Robinson copy from Joshua Reynolds<U+2019>, Sold George Squibb Auctioneers, London, 2nd July 1825, lot.118 </ref> he was sent on the recommendation of Reynolds to the [[Royal Academy]] Schools in 1791. 
By 1794 Owen had moved out of his lodgings with Cotton on Gate Street and into a new to studio at No.211 [[Piccadilly]] where he remained for two years before moving to No.5 Coventry Street, [[Haymarket]]. <ref name="TheRoyal"> The Royal Academy of Arts: A complete dictionary of contributors and their works from its foundation in 1769 to 1904 Vol.VI Oakes-Rymsdyck. London, Henry Graves & Co and George Bell & Sons, 1906, p.33 </ref> It is whilst living here that he presumably came into contact with future wife Lener Leaf, whose father worked in [[Haymarket]] as a shoe maker. 
By 1797 Owen was working as a studio assistant to [[John Hoppner]] (1758-1810), who by this point was struggling to keep up with the demand for copies of his portraits. <ref> The Farington Diary, Joseph Farington ed. James Greig, London, Hutchinson & Co, vol.1, p.210 </ref> Owen was clearly also experiencing some success in his own right, for in the same year he painted Lener, along with her younger sister, and exhibited the portrait at [[Somerset House]] - the then location of [[Royal Academy]] exhibitions, <ref> no.13 <U+2013> Portrait of Two Ladies (The Two Misses Leafes) </ref> receiving a great deal of praise and encouragement. <ref name="TheAnnual"> The Annual Biography and Obituary, vol.X, 1826, p.359 </ref> Owen married Lener later that year on the 2nd December and their son William was born soon after. 
In 1800 Owen and his family moved to [[Pimlico]], although choosing to maintain his recently acquired studio at No.51 [[Leicester Square]], next door to the house in which [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] lived. This remained Owen<U+2019>s studio until he became too ill and moved out in 1818. <ref> The Royal Academy of Arts: A complete dictionary of contributors and their works from its foundation in 1769 to 1904 Vol.VI Oakes-Rymsdyck. London, Henry Graves & Co and George Bell & Sons, 1906, p.34 </ref>  
The year 1797/8 was perhaps the most significant in Owen<U+2019>s career as a painter; in 1797 he painted the then [[Prime Minister]] [[William Pitt the younger]] (1759-1806) which he exhibited the following year along with a portrait of the [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Alexander Wedderburn]] (1733-1805). <ref name="TheRoyal" />

== Royal appointment ==

In 1810 following the death of [[John Hoppner]] (1758-1810), Owen was appointed portrait painter to the [[Prince of Wales]], later [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV (1762-1830).]] Unfortunately the prince never gave a sitting and instead Owen had to rely on a number of head sketches by his predecessor Hoppner to create a likeness. In 1813 Owen was offered a [[knighthood]] however he declined.

== Decline in health ==

In 1818 William Owen left his house in [[Pimlico]] and his studio in [[Leicester Square]] and moved to Bruton Street, most probably due to his slowly decreasing health, his eagerness however remained unscathed and he exhibited eight works at the [[Royal Academy]] the following year. In 1819 Owen travelled to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] to meet a respectable man of medicine named Mr Hicks, however this seemed to have no positive effect and he soon returned to [[London]]. By 1820 Owen was confined to his bed where, with the exception of a brief six months spent in [[Chelsea]] towards the end of 1824, he remained until his death five years later. <ref name="TheAnnual" />

== Death ==

In 1825 Owen died after being accidentally poisoned by an overdose of <U+2018>Barclay<U+2019>s Drops<U+2019> <U+2013> a mixture of aniseed, camphor and [[opium]]. Owen was very ill at the time, being confined to his bedroom and unable to move his limbs, relying on a draught medicine to aid his recovery. When the draught ran out his cook was sent to fetch another bottle, along with a bottle of Barclay<U+2019>s Drops, however the [[chemist]] labelled the two bottles wrong and as a result Owen took a fatal dose of the opium based medicine, dying hours later.
At the inquest on 13th March 1825 the following verdict was reached by the jury:

''<U+201C>That the deceased, Mr. Wm. Owen, Esq,. died from taking a large quantity of Barclays drops; the bottle containing that liquid having been negligently and incautiously labelled, by the person who prepared the medicine as an opening draught, such as the said Mr. Owen had been in the habit of taking and thatwe understand the above lamented mistake took place at the house of Mr. Smith, a chymist and druggist in the Haymarket.<U+201D>'' <ref> The Times, 15th March 1825, issue:12601,  p.3. </ref>

Owen was buried on 19th March 1825 at Saint Lukes, Chelsea, <ref> London Metropolitan Archives, Saint Luke, Chelsea, Grave Register, P74/LUK, Iten 282; Call Number: p74/luk/282 </ref> in a private ceremony attended by family and close friends, including; [[Sir Thomas Lawrence]], [[Sir Richard Westmacott]], [[Thomas Phillips]] and <U+2018>Thompson<U+2019> <U+2013> most probably Thomas Clement Thompson. <ref> The Annual Biography and Obituary, vol.X, 1826, p.366 </ref>
