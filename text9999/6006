There are 51 '''Grade I listed buildings''' in [[Bristol]], [[England]].

In [[England and Wales]] the authority for listing is granted by the [[Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990]] and is presently administered by [[English Heritage]], an agency of the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]. In Bristol the city council maintains the list of Grade I listed buildings.<ref>{{cite web | title= Grade I Listed Buildings in Bristol (15 August 2003) | work=Bristol City Council | url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/cms-service/download/asset/?asset_id=14204066 | accessdate=2007-04-24}}</ref>

In the [[United Kingdom]] the term [[listed building]] refers to a building or other structure officially designated as being of special architectural, historical or cultural significance. Grade I buildings are described as being "buildings of outstanding or national architectural or historic interest".</onlyinclude>

Several of the entries relate to more than one listed structure where these have been group together as part of the same geographical location or where ancillary structures, such as the walls and gate in front of a building, are listed separately.<onlyinclude>
