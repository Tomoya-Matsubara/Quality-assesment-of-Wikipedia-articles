<!-- Per MOS:TM, please do not replace "Reddit" with "reddit". -->'''Reddit''' {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|r|<U+025B>|d|<U+026A>|t}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Whatdoesthenameredditmean |title=Frequently Asked Questions: What does the name "reddit" mean? |publisher=reddit |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref>
stylized as '''reddit''', is a [[social news]] and entertainment website where registered users submit content in the form of either a link or a text ("self") post. Other users then vote the submission "up" or "down", which is used to rank the post and determine its position on the site's pages and front page. Reddit is based in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].

Reddit was founded by [[Steve Huffman]] and [[Alexis Ohanian]]. It was acquired by [[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications]] in October 2006. In September 2011, Reddit was split from Cond<U+00E9> Nast, and now operates as a subsidiary of Cond<U+00E9> Nast's parent company, [[Advance Publications]].

== Overview ==
The site is a collection of entries submitted by its registered users, essentially a [[bulletin board system]]. The entries are organized into areas of interest called "subreddits". Historically, the front page was the main subreddit, and other areas were "subreddits". There is now no main subreddit.

Registered users, especially those who post new entries, or post comments to entries, are called "redditors", a [[portmanteau]] of "reddit editor". Reddit itself is a portmanteau of "read/edit" and of "read it", i.e., "I read it on Reddit".

As submissions post to the site, redditors can vote for or against them (upvote/downvote). Each reddit has a front page that shows newer submissions that have been rated highly. Redditors can also post comments about the submission, and respond back and forth in a conversation tree of comments; the comments themselves can also be upvoted and downvoted.

The home page of Reddit displays front page content from selected subreddits. There is a default set, but registered users can customize their set.

Redditors can "friend" one another, which gives a redditor quick access to posting and comments of their friend list.

Postings are typically a link to an external source, with a title provided by the redditor who posted it. Some redditors use the site as a personal bookmark collection. Others, relying on the size and activity of Reddit, and on the crowd sourced ratings of links, use it as a news aggregator.

Reddit also allows postings that do not link externally. These are called "self posts" or "text submissions". Reddit encourages links over text submissions, by allowing redditors to accumulate points ("karma") for highly rated links, but not for self-posts. Redditors also accumulate karma for highly rated comments, on posts of both kinds.

The commenting system and friend system, along with a certain "Reddit ethos" (called ''reddiquette'' on Reddit), lend Reddit aspects of a social network, though not to the extent of Facebook, [[Google+]], and other websites aimed at social networking.

Front page rank, for both the general front page and for individual subreddits, is determined by the age of the submission, positive ("upvoted") to negative ("downvoted") feedback ratio and the total vote count.<ref name="SEOmoz">{{cite web |url=http://www.seomoz.org/blog/reddit-stumbleupon-delicious-and-hacker-news-algorithms-exposed|title=reddit algorithm|work=[[seomoz]]}}</ref> Dozens of submissions cycle through these front pages daily.

{{As of|June 2013}}, commentary on the site is particularly active, with several communities generating thousands of comments per day.<ref>http://stattit.com/subreddits/by_comments_avg_1d/</ref> Popular comments have generated many '[[Internet meme|memes]]' within the Reddit community.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The Reddit community has been known to socialise at local parks and bars around the world,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/ |title=Reddit Worldwide Meetups |publisher=Reddit.com |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref> and there are many localised subreddits for local meetings.

== Subreddits ==
Any registered user may create a subreddit, although a link to do so does not appear on the user's homepage until after thirty days.<ref>{{cite web |title=Re: Can I make my own subreddit? |url=http://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/hmddo/can_i_make_my_own_subreddit/c1wlqgu |date=28 May 2011}}</ref> There are over 5,400 active subreddits to peruse,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.reddit.com/2013/06/browse-future-of-reddit-re-introducing.html|title=Browse the Future of reddit: Re-Introducing Multireddits|date=7 June 2013|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref> with a default set of 20 put in place in October 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Erik|title=Saying goodbye to an old friend and revising the default subreddits|url=http://blog.reddit.com/2011/10/saying-goodbye-to-old-friend-and.html|accessdate=8 February 2013|date=18 October 2011}}</ref>

Users may customize what is shown on their personal front page by subscribing to individual subreddits through a page that shows all subreddits available. The site's general front page is also accessible via a link to "all" at the top of the individual user's customised front page.

One of the most popular subreddits is IAmA ("I am a") where a user may post "AMAs" (for "Ask Me Anything"), or similarly "AMAAs" ( for "Ask Me Almost Anything") <U+2013> prompts for others to ask questions any topic. AMAs are open to all Reddit users, and use the site's comment system for both questions and answers.

A number of notable individuals have participated in the IAmA subreddit, including President [[Barack Obama]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Barack Obama AMA|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/sort=new|publisher=Reddit}}</ref><ref name="potus-telegraph">{{cite news

The team expanded to include Christopher Slowe in November 2005. Between November 2005 and January 2006 Reddit merged with [[Aaron Swartz]]'s company Infogami, and Swartz became an equal owner of the resulting parent company, Not A Bug.<ref>

== Technology ==
Reddit was originally written in [[Common Lisp]] but was rewritten in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] in December 2005.<ref>{{cite web|author=steve [spez] |url=http://blog.reddit.com/2005/12/on-lisp.html |title="On lisp" blog post by Reddit founder "spez", detailing the reasons for switching to python from lisp |publisher=Blog.reddit.com |date=2005-12-05 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref> The reasons given for the switch were wider access to [[Library (computing)|code libraries]] and greater development flexibility. The Python web framework that former Reddit employee [[Aaron Swartz]] developed to run the site, ''web.py'', is now available as an open-source project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webpy.org/ |title=Official web.py site |publisher=Webpy.org |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref>

Reddit currently uses [[Pylons web framework|Pylons]] as its web framework.<ref>[http://wiki.pylonshq.com/display/pylonscommunity/Sites+Using+Pylons Sites Using Pylons] <U+2013> Pylons Community&nbsp;<U+2013> PythonWeb</ref> {{As of|November 2009}}, Reddit has decommissioned their physical servers and migrated to [[Amazon Web Services]].<ref>{{cite web|author=jeremy [jedberg] |url=http://blog.reddit.com/2009/11/moving-to-cloud.html |title=Moving to the cloud |publisher=Blog.reddit.com |date=November 10, 2009 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref>

Reddit uses [[PostgreSQL]] as primary datastore and slowly moving to [[Apache Cassandra]], a column oriented datastore. It uses [[RabbitMQ]] for offline processing, HAProxy for load balancing and [[memcached]] for caching.

In early 2009, Reddit started using [[jQuery]].<ref>[http://blog.reddit.com/2009/01/reddit-now-powered-by-jquery.html what's new on reddit: reddit now powered by jQuery] <U+2013> Posted by Chris Slowe (keysersosa) (Friday, January 30, 2009) <U+2013> blog.reddit</ref>

On June 7, 2010, Reddit staff launched a revamped mobile interface featuring rewritten [[CSS]], a new color scheme, and a multitude of improvements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.reddit.com/2010/06/better-mobile-reddit-for-all.html |title=A better mobile reddit for all |publisher=[[reddit.com]] |date=2010-06-09 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}</ref>

There are several unofficial applications that use the Reddit [[API]] on the [[Android Market]], including ''Reddit is Fun'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.andrewshu.android.reddit |title=reddit is fun <U+2013> Android Application on the Android market |publisher=Appbrain.com |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref> ''Andreddit'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.tomdryer.reddit |title=Download andreddit for your Android phone on AppBrain |publisher=Appbrain.com |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref> ''F5'', ''BaconReader'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baconreader.com/ |title=a tasty new reddit app |publisher=baconreader |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> and an Android tablet specific application called ''Reddita''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://market.android.com/details?id=com.leyths.reddita.free |title=Reddita <U+2013> Android Market |publisher=Market.android.com |date=2011-11-15 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref> For Apple's iOS, there is an official Reddit app called iReddit<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ireddit/id302732279?mt=8 |title=iTunes App Store iReddit |publisher=reddit.com |date= |accessdate=December 7, 2011}}</ref> as well as a number of unofficial third party client apps.

== Demographics ==
According to Google Ad Planner's estimate, as of May 2013, the median Reddit user is male (59%), 25<U+2013>34 years of age, and is connecting from the United States (68%).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/adplanner/site_profile#siteDetails?uid=reddit.com&geo=001&lp=false|title=Google Display Network Ad Planner <U+2013> reddit.com|accessdate=March 3, 2012|publisher=[[Google]]}} <U+2013> Requires a Google account to view.</ref>

== Community and culture ==
The website is known for its open nature and diverse user community that generate its content. Its demographics allows for wide-ranging subject areas, or main subreddits, that receive much attention, as well as the ability for smaller subreddits to serve more niche purposes. The unique possibilities that subreddits provide create new opportunities for raising attention and fostering discussion across many areas. In gaining popularity in terms of unique users per day, Reddit has been a platform for many to raise publicity for a number of causes. And with that increased ability to garner attention and a large audience, users can use one of the largest communities on the Internet for new, revolutionary, and influential purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blueglass.com/blog/could-reddit-be-the-worlds-most-influential-website/ |title=Could Reddit be the world's most influential website? |publisher=BlueGlass |date= |accessdate=April 26, 2012}}</ref>

Its popularity has enabled users to take unprecedented advantage of such a large community. Its innovative socially ranked rating and sorting system drives a method that is useful for fulfilling certain goals of viewership or simply finding answers to interesting questions. User sentiments about the website's function and structure include feelings about the breadth and depth of the discussions on Reddit and how the site makes it easy to discover new and interesting items. Almost all of the user reviews on Alexa.com, which rates Reddit's monthly unique traffic rating 125th in the United States, mention Reddit's "good content" as a likable quality. However, others raise the negative aspects of the potential for Reddit's communities to possess a "hive mind" of sorts,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com |title=Reddit.com Site Info |publisher=Alexa.com |date= |accessdate=April 26, 2012}}</ref> embodying some negative aspects of group interaction theories like [[crowd psychology]] and [[collective consciousness]].

In recent history, Reddit has been known as the instigator of several large-scale projects, some short and others long-term, in order to benefit others. A selection of major events are outlined below:
* In early December 2010, members of the Christianity subreddit decided to hold a fundraiser<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/eito5/if_every_member_of_rchristianity_donates_just_445/ |title=If every member of r/Christianity donates just $4.45, we can build a health clinic in an impoverished area that desperately needs one.

Later, the Islam subreddit joined in, raising money for [[Islamic Relief]]. In less than a week, the three communities (as well as the Reddit community at large) raised over $200,000. Most of this was raised by the atheism subreddit,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/r-atheism/ratheism |title=reddit.com/r/Atheism's Fundraising Page |date= |accessdate=May 7, 2012}}</ref> though the Christianity subreddit had a higher donation amount per subscriber.
* In early October 2010, a story was posted on Reddit about a seven-year-old girl, Kathleen Edward, who was in the advanced stages of [[Huntington's disease]]. The girl's neighbors were taunting her and her family. Redditors banded together and gave the girl a shopping spree<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/dpp/news/local/toy-store-shopping-spree-for-kathleen-edward |title=Toy Store Shopping Spree for Kathleen Edward |publisher=Myfoxdetroit.com |date=2010-10-12 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref><ref>Stryker, Cole (2010-12-10).

* Reddit started the largest [[Secret Santa]] program in the world, which is still in operation to date. For the 2010 Holiday season, 92 countries were involved in the Secret Santa program. There were 17,543 participants, and $662,907.60 was collectively spent on gift purchases and shipping costs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://venturebeat.com/2010/12/23/secret-santa-success-caps-banner-year-for-reddit/ |title=Secret Santa success caps banner year for Reddit |last1=Boitnott |first1=John |date=December 23, 2010 |work=VentureBeat Interpreting Innovation |publisher=VentureBeat |accessdate=January 3, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-12-20/secret-santa-the-creator-of-reddits-gift-exchange-the-worlds-biggest/ | title = The Biggest Secret Santa Gift Exchange in the World | accessdate = 2011-02-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://redditgifts.com/statistics/ | title = Statistics for Secret Santa 2010 | accessdate = 2011-02-12 }}</ref>
* Members from Reddit donated over $600,000 to [[DonorsChoose]] in support of Stephen Colbert's [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear|March to Keep Fear Alive]]. The donation spree broke previous records for the most money donated to a single cause by the Reddit community and resulted in an interview with Colbert on Reddit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=39361 |title=Restoring Truthiness Giving Page |publisher=Donorschoose.org |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref>

=== "Restoring Truthiness" campaign ===
As a response to [[Glenn Beck]]'s August 28, 2010, [[Restoring Honor rally]] (heavily promoted by him in his [[FOX News]] broadcasts during the summer), in September 2010 Reddit users started a movement to persuade [[Stephen Colbert]] to have a counter-rally in Washington, D.C.<ref name="Colbert Rally">{{cite news|last=Friedman |first=Megan |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/09/14/reddit-campaign-for-colbert-rally-breaks-charity-records/ |title=Reddit Campaign for Colbert Rally Breaks Donation Record |publisher=Time NewsFeed |date=September 14, 2010 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref> The movement was started by user mrsammercer, in a post where he describes waking up from a dream in which Stephen Colbert holds a satirical rally in D.C.<ref>{{cite web|author=mrsammercer |url=http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/d7ntl/ive_had_a_vision_and_i_cant_shake_it_colbert/ |title=I've had a vision and I can't shake it: Colbert needs to hold a satirical rally in DC |publisher=Reddit.com |date=August 31, 2010 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref>

He writes, "This would be the high water mark of American satire. Half a million people pretending to suspend all rational thought in unison. Perfect harmony. It'll feel like San Francisco in the late 60s, only we won't be able to get any acid."

The idea resonated with the Reddit community, which launched a campaign to bring the event to life. Over $600,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=39361 |title=Restoring Truthiness donor page |publisher=Donorschoose.org |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref> was raised for charity to gain the attention of Colbert. The campaign was mentioned on-air several times, and when the [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]] was held in Washington, D.C. on October 30, 2010, thousands of redditors made the journey.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schiraldi |first=Mike |url=http://blog.reddit.com/2010/11/buy-shirts-remember-rally-question.html |title=Buy Shirts, Remember the Rally, Question Colbert, and Smile |publisher=blog.reddit |date=November 12, 2010 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref>

During a post-rally press conference, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian asked, "What role did the Internet campaign play in convincing you to hold this rally?" Jon Stewart responded by saying that, though it was a very nice gesture, the two had already thought of the idea prior and the deposit on using the National Mall was already paid during the summer, so it acted mostly as a "validation of what we were thinking about attempting".<ref>[http://www.mediaite.com/tv/jon-stewart-and-stephen-colbert-hold-post-rally-to-restore-sanity-press-conference/ Rally to Restore Sanity <U+2013> Press Conference <U+2013> Video] [[Mediaite]]. October 30, 2010.</ref> In a message to the Reddit community, Colbert later added, "I have no doubt that your efforts to organize and the joy you clearly brought to your part of the story contributed greatly to the turnout and success."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ee20j/stephen_colbert_has_answered_your_questions/ |title=Stephen Colbert has answered your questions : IAmA |publisher=Reddit.com |date=November 30, 2010 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref>

=== Controversies involving Reddit ===
{{Main|Controversial Reddit communities}}

The website has a strong culture of free speech and very few rules about the types of content that may be posted.<ref name="reddit-rules">{{cite web|url=http://www.reddit.com/rules|title=rules of reddit|accessdate=14 Oct 2012}}</ref> This has led to the creation of several communities that have been perceived as offensive, including forums dedicated to [[jailbait]] (since banned) and pictures of dead bodies; several such subreddits were the focus of an edition of ''[[Anderson Cooper 360]]'' in September 2011.<ref>[[Anderson Cooper 360]], 9/29/2011.</ref> However, "Suggestive or sexual content featuring minors" was not explicitly banned until February 2012, after members of the forum [[Something Awful]] planned to send correspondence to "Parent Teacher Associations, politicians, churches, news outlets and the FBI" about such subreddits.<ref>[http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/02/reddit-bans-sexual-content-featuring-minors.php Reddit Bans <U+2018>Sexual Content Featuring Minors<U+2019> | TPM Idea Lab<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In October 2012, a ''[[Gawker]]'' article published the real-life identity of "[[Violentacrez]]", a Reddit moderator prominently involved with a string of controversial subreddits devoted to explicit material.<ref name=Guardian1>{{cite news|title=Why Reddit Politics ban on Gawker will stay, by a moderator|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/oct/16/reddit-gawker-ban?CMP=twt_fd|newspaper=Guardian|date=16 October 2012}}</ref><ref name=Guardian2>{{cite news|last=Holpuch|first=Amanda|title=Reddit user Violentacrez fired from job after Gawker expos<U+00E9>|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/oct/16/reddit-violentacrez-gawker-expose?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487|newspaper=Guardian|date=16 October 2012}}</ref> As a result of the story, the user, revealed to be a middle-aged computer programmer from Texas, was fired from his job.<ref name=Guardian2/> In response to the expos<U+00E9>, a number of Reddit moderators banned ''Gawker'' links from their subreddits.<ref name=Guardian1/>

Following the 2013 [[Boston Marathon bombings]], Reddit faced criticism after users wrongly identified a number of people as suspects.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Innocents-accused-in-online-manhunt/tabid/412/articleID/295143/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ |title= Innocents accused in online manhunt | date=April 22, 2013}}</ref> Notable among misidentified bombing suspects was [[Disappearance of Sunil Tripathi|Sunil Tripathi,]] a student reported missing before the bombings took place. A body reported to be Sunil's was found in Rhode Island's Providence River on April 25, 2013 as reported by the Rhode Island Health Department. The cause of death is under investigation.<ref>http://www.deccanchronicle.com/130426/news-world/article/family-says-sunil-tripathi-showed-signs-depression</ref> Reddit general manager Erik Martin later issued an apology for this behavior, criticizing the "online witch hunts and dangerous speculation" that took place on the website.<ref name="Martin apology">{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Erik|title=Reflections on the Recent Boston Crisis|url=http://blog.reddit.com/2013/04/reflections-on-recent-boston-crisis.html|work=Reddit.com|accessdate=5/3/13}}</ref>
