The main [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] heading into Backlash on the [[WWE Raw|Raw]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]] was between [[John Cena]], [[Adam Copeland|Edge]], [[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Randy Orton]], with the four feuding over the [[WWE Championship]]. At the [[Royal Rumble (2007)|2007 Royal Rumble]] in January, Michaels was one of the final two participants of the [[Royal Rumble#Match|Royal Rumble match]] before getting eliminated by [[The Undertaker]].<ref name="2007rumble">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/2007/matches/35535102/results/|title=A Phenom-enal Rumble|date=2007-01-28|first=Louie|last=Dee|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/matches|title=Royal Rumble 2007 results|date=2007-01-28|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref> On the [[February 5]] [[2007]] edition of ''Raw'', Michaels defeated Edge and Randy Orton in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]] to become the number one contender to the  WWE Championship at [[WrestleMania 23]].<ref name="February 5">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/02052007|title=Tickets punched for WrestleMania|date=2007-02-05|first=Brett|last=Hoffman|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref> At WrestleMania 23, Cena defeated Michaels to retain the WWE Championship, forcing him to [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submit]] to the [[Professional wrestling holds#STS|STFU]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wrestlemania23/matches/39161841/results/|title=Detroit, Champ City|date=2007-04-01|first=Louie|last= Dee|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref> On the [[April 9]] edition of ''Raw'', a match between Michaels and Orton to determine the number one contender ended in a [[No contest (boxing)|no-contest]] after both men's shoulders were on the mat while they were pinning one another.

[[List of authority figures in professional wrestling#Temporary/Honorary General Managers|Honorary General Manager]] Michael Pena, from the [[Make-a-Wish Foundation]], however, announced that Michaels, Orton, and Edge would face Cena for the title at Backlash in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Fatal Four-Way match]].<ref name="April 9">{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/04092007|title=Redemption|date=2007-10-28|first=Noah|last=Starr|publisher=WWE|accessdate= 2007-11-16 }}</ref>
