'''''Ghosts I<U+2013>IV''''' is the sixth studio album by American [[industrial rock]] act [[Nine Inch Nails]], released on March 2, 2008. The team behind the project included Nine Inch Nails front man [[Trent Reznor]], studio-collaborators [[Atticus Ross]] and [[Alan Moulder]], and instrumental contributions from [[Alessandro Cortini]], [[Adrian Belew]], and [[Brian Viglione]]. Reznor described the music of ''Ghosts'' as "a soundtrack for daydreams", a sentiment echoed by many critics who compared it with the work of [[Brian Eno]] and [[Robert Fripp]]. The songs are unnamed, and are identified only by their track listing, position, and album art.

The album is the first independent release from Nine Inch Nails following its announcement that it had severed its ties with [[Interscope Records]]. Initially intended to be a five-track [[Extended Play|EP]], the final release consists of four nine-track instrumental EPs, totaling 36 tracks. The album was released under a [[Creative Commons]] license, and in a variety of differing packages at various [[price point]]s, including a [[United States dollar|US$]]300 "Ultra-Deluxe Limited Edition".  ''Ghosts'' was initially released digitally on the official Nine Inch Nails website without any prior advertisement or promotion.  Via the official Nine Inch Nails [[YouTube]] profile, a user-generated "film festival" was announced, where fans were invited to visually interpret the album's music and post their results.

Critical reception of the album has been generally favorable, with its unorthodox release attracting positive comments from many critics.  Much coverage of ''Ghosts I<U+2013>IV'' has compared it to the digital-download releases of [[Radiohead]]'s ''[[In Rainbows]]'' as well as [[Saul Williams]]' ''[[The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!]]''. The album was nominated for two [[Grammy Award]]s, in the categories "Best Rock Instrumental Performance" and "Best Box Set or Limited Edition Package".  These nominations represented the first time music released under a Creative Commons license had been nominated for a Grammy Award.

Nine Inch Nails front man [[Trent Reznor]] announced in 2007 that the band had completed its contractual obligations to its record label, [[Interscope Records]], and would no longer be working with the company. Reznor also revealed that Nine Inch Nails would likely distribute its next album independently, possibly in a fashion similar to [[rapper]] [[Saul Williams]]' 2007 album ''[[The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!]]'', which Reznor produced.<ref name="Interscope split">{{cite web

The core creative team behind the project was Reznor, [[Atticus Ross]], and [[Alan Moulder]].  [[Nine Inch Nails live performances|Live-band]] member [[Alessandro Cortini]] and studio musicians [[Adrian Belew]] and [[Brian Viglione]] also contributed instrumental performances on select tracks.<ref name="more_info" /> Reznor described the band's early intentions for the project as "an experiment", and explained the group's process:

<blockquote>When we started working with the music, we would generally start with a sort of visual reference that we had imagined: a place, or a setting, or a situation.  And then attempt to describe that with sound and texture and melody.  And treat it, in a sense, as if it were a soundtrack.<ref name="Film Festival intro">{{cite web

Cortini recounted in an interview that he was brought onto the project two weeks into the process, and that his involvement evolved from "first recording some extra parts to some tracks" and eventually into "a collaboration on [the] tracks noted in the booklet".<ref>{{cite web

''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated, "There's too much here. Yet it's the most interesting NIN in years."

The album's unorthodox distribution methods also garnered the attention of various news agencies, such as ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'''s Eliot Van Buskirk, who labeled ''Ghosts'' as "a remarkably extensive release".<ref>{{cite web

''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s review called the album a "A new-media showpiece",<ref name="RS review" /> while [[Tiny Mix Tapes]] said "the circumstances surrounding the release are so forward-thinking that they could be considered just as key to appreciating the album as the music itself."<ref name="Tiny Mix Tapes review" />  Business website [[Motley Fool|The Motley Fool]] wrote an article on the album's release titled simply "Music Industry Gets Nailed Again", forecasting that "Innovators like Nine Inch Nails are paving the way for new media business models that may bypass the middleman while making sure artists ''and'' fans are happy."<ref>{{cite web
