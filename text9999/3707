The '''Archaeological Museum of Nikopolis''' is a [[museum]] in [[Nicopolis]], of the [[Preveza Prefecture]] in [[Greece]].

==History==
Until the year 1940, the <U+2018><U+2019>Archaeological Museum of Preveza <U+2013> Nikopolis<U+2019><U+2019> was located in an Ottoman [[mosque]], in the city of [[Preveza, Greece]]. In the year 1940, the mosque was bombed by Italian aircraft and was  partially destroyed. Some of the exhibits were stolen. After the [[Second World War]], the mosque was demolished by the Greek state. In the year 1965 the state built a small Archaeological [[Museum]] inside the Byzantine walls of ancient Nikopolis. From 1998 to 2006 a new archaeological museum was built 5&nbsp;km North of Preveza,but it will not open until 2010.
