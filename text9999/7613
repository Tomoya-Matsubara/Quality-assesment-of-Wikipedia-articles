'''Loreto Convent''' was a Catholic convent which operated as a girls' school in [[Claremont, Western Australia]] between 1901 and 1976.

== Building ==
In 1894, businessman [[James Grave]] built the '''Osborne Hotel''' on a cliff-top in Claremont. Considered to be Perth's finest hotel,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article33147684 |title=OSBORNE. |newspaper=[[Western_Mail_(Western_Australia)|Western Mail (Perth, WA : 1885 - 1954)]] |location=Perth, WA |date=10 December 1897 |accessdate=14 January 2014 |page=240 Edition: CHRISTMAS |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> it had panoramic views of the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]] and included a tower and raised turrets and was surrounded by two acres (0.8 ha) of landscaped gardens.<ref>{{cite wikisource|chapter=James Grave|wslink=History of West Australia|plaintitle=History of West Australia|last=|first=|year=|publisher=|page=|wspage=|scan=}} </ref>  In 1898 Graves found himself 'financially embarrassed' and sold the hotel to [[William Dalgety Moore]].<ref>{{cite web|author=G.

The property was purchased by the [[Catholic church|Catholic]] [[Sisters of Loreto|Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary]] in 1901.<ref name=loreto1>{{cite web|url=http://www.loretonedlands.wa.edu.au/history.html|title=Osborne, Claremont |work=Loreto Australia and South East Asia|accessdate=14/01/2014}}</ref><ref name=sho1>{{Cite web|url=http://inherit.stateheritage.wa.gov.au/Public/Inventory/Details/dfc098c6-0595-42eb-8e0b-2fcd7f163667|title=Osborne Hotel Site|publisher=State Heritage Office|accessdate=14/01/2014}}</ref>  The convent was formally known as '''Loreto Osborne, Claremont'''.  A chapel and sleeping accommodation for the sisters were built in 1938 and in 1963 the old hotel building was demolished to make way for a new building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loreto.org.au/Home/About-us/Loreto-In-Australia/Timeline-of-Loreto-in-Australia.aspx#&slider1=23|title=Timeline of Loreto In Australia|accessdate=14/01/2014|work=Loreto Australia and South East Asia}}</ref>

In 1963 the senior pupils from Loreto Nedlands were moved to the Claremont school, and in 1977 Loreto Osborne amalgamated with [[St. Louis School, Claremont, Western Australia|St. Louis]] boys' school to form [[John XXIII College (Perth)|John XXIII College]].<ref name=loreto1 /> The school remained the senior campus of the College until the latter's move to Mount Claremont in 1986, and the site was subsequently occupied by the Western Australian International College.

The convent buildings were demolished in 1990, with residential housing built on the location at 101-109 Bindaring Parade, Claremont.<ref name=sho1 />
