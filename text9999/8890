'''Skull mounts''' are sometimes referred to as '''European mounts''', western skull mounts, or western mounts. <ref name="Skull Mounts">{{cite web|last=Scheffler|first=Dave|title=Skull Mounts|url=http://www.european-skull-mounts.com|publisher=Thorp Web|accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref> They are a large portion of [[taxedermy]] work. Only the skull of the animal is displayed, which will have [[horns]], [[antlers]], or nothing attached to the skull depending on the animal.  These mounts can be displayed however the owner would like. 

=Creating Skull Mounts=

== Boiling ==

The traditional method of removing muscle and other flesh tissue leaving only the clean skull is boiling the entire head of the animal.  This method was the first to be used in skull mounting.

=== Advantages ===

This method is very inexpensive and can be done with few supplies that can be found in any grocery or general supplies store.<ref name=DIY>{{cite web|title=DIY European Skull Mounts|url=http://ecosportsmen.com/?p=256|accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref> This method can produce a finishing product on a day or less. <ref name=DIY>{{cite web}}</ref>
=== Disadvantages ===

This method takes a very long time to complete, sometimes taking an entire day.<ref name=DIY>{{cite web}}</ref> One very important con of boiling is that the fats and [[pigments]] tend to stain the skull.  Boiling also loosens and separates the many bones in a skull leaving it weaker and less stable. <ref name="Skull Mounts">{{cite web}}</ref> There are some harmful chemicals that are used in the process such as [[Borax]].  These chemicals are extremely harmful if ingested.  This method also has to be done outside because of the smell and mess it leaves afterward. <ref name=DIY>{{cite web}}</ref>
== Beetles ==

Using [[dermestidae]] beetles to eat away flesh is a modern method of cleaning the skulls for skull mounts and is increasing in popularity.

=== Advantages ===

Skull Mounts or Western Skull Mounts using [[dermestidae]] beetles has advantages over boiling a skull.  First, is that it leaves the skull superior in whiteness and the skull stays tight and durable in structure. <ref name="Skull Mounts">{{cite web}}</ref> Second, is there is no dealing with harmful chemicals, boiled flesh smells, and there is not as much to clean up afterwards.

=== Disadvantages ===

This method requires people to send in their animals in, as not many people possess these beetles.  If someone has these beetles for use, there is cost in obtaining them and in keeping them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Starter Kits|url=http://www.skulltaxidermy.com/kits.html}}</ref>
