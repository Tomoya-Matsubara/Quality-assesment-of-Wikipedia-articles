Before the [[Second World War]] Hichens was a keen sportsman who rowed for [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] and competed in the [[Double scull]]s at the [[Henley Regatta]]. He also competed in [[International Fourteen]] sailing events and three times participated in the [[Fastnet race]]. On land he raced in [[hillclimbing|Hill Climbing]] events in [[Somerset]] and also entered the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] race three times. During the Second World War, he rose in rank to become  a [[lieutenant commander]] and commanded first the 6th [[Motor Gun Boat]] Flotilla and  later the 8th Motor Gun Boat Flotilla.

==Early life==
Robert Peverell Hichens was born 2 March 1909, the son of Doctor Peverell Smythe Hichens and Constance Sawbridge Hichens.<ref>Hichens, p.2</ref><ref name=telegraph>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-November-25|publisher=''Daily Telegraph''|title=Telegraph announcements|url=http://announcements.telegraph.co.uk/inmemoriam/02-Mar-2009/02-Mar-2009/all/1/announcement95351.aspx}}</ref> He spent his early life in [[Northampton]], until the start of the [[Great War]] when his father<U+2014>an officer in a [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] unit of the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]]<U+2014>was sent to France, when the rest of the family moved to [[St Mawes]] in [[Cornwall]].<ref name=hi3>Hichens, p.3</ref> It was when living in Cornwall that Hichens and his sister Loveday were taught how to sail, eventually sailing their [[dinghy]] ''Arethusa'' on [[Carrick Roads]].<ref name=hi3/>

===Education===
In 1919, following the Great War, the family returned to the Northampton area, and Hichens was sent to a [[Preparatory school (UK)|prep school]] nearby until 1921, when he was enrolled in [[Marlborough College]].<ref name=hi4>Hichens, p.4</ref> In 1922, Hichens' father, by now a consulting physician at Northampton General hospital, retired and the family moved to [[Guernsey]] in the [[Channel Islands]], purchasing ''Havelet House'' just outside [[Saint Peter Port]].<ref name=hi4/>
Hichens entered [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] to read law in 1927.  A keen sportsman, he started rowing and within six months was in the Magdalan second eight and by the following year he made the first eight as stroke oarsman.<ref>Hichens, pp.5&ndash;9</ref> In the annual [[Head of the River Race]] when Hichens was at Magdalen they came third in 1928, sixth in 1929 and eighth in 1930, which was the college's lowest position in the race since 1876.<ref>Hichens, p.9</ref> While at university he also joined the [[Officers Training Corps]], receiving a commission as [[second lieutenant]] in the infantry on 2 June 1929.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=33565 |date=31 December 1929|startpage=8505|endpage= |supp= |accessdate=2009-November-25|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/33565/pages/8505}}</ref> In 1929, the Hichens family had purchased ''Bodrennick House'' at [[Flushing, Cornwall]], which they moved into in 1930, after the death of Hichens' father.<ref name=hi4/>

===Married life===
Robert Hichens met his future wife, Catherine Gilbert Enys of [[Flushing, Cornwall]], in 1928; they were married at St Gluvias church, [[Penryn, Cornwall]] in April 1931.<ref>Hichens, p.16</ref> The following year he joined a firm of solicitors, Reginald Rodgers and son of [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], as an [[articled clerk]] to be instructed as a [[solicitor]].<ref>Hichens, pp.15&ndash;18</ref> Hichens also trained in London with Mackrell's of [[Bedford Square]]; it was when working in London that he competed at the [[Henley Regatta]] in the [[Double scull]]s.<ref name=hi19>Hichens, p.19</ref>  In June 1933, after his mother's death, Hichens inherited half of his father's estate and ''Bodrennick House'', and at the same time completed his articles. He became a junior partner with Reginald Rodgers on 1 January 1934.<ref name=hi19/>
Robert and Catherine had two sons: Robert, born in 1932, and Anthony, born in 1936.<ref>Hichens, p.24</ref><ref name=telegraph/>

===Competitive sailing===
During this time Hichens had continued to sail; he joined the [[ Royal Cornish Yacht Club]] and started to race in [[International Fourteen]] events in his own dinghies called ''Venture'' and ''Venture II''.<ref name=cook43/> He competed in the [[Fowey]] Regatta and the Prince of Wales Cup, coming fifth on the [[River Clyde]] in 1936.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=''The Times''|date=27 July 1936|accessdate=2009-November-28|title=Price of Wales Cup|url=http://www.royalcornwallyachtclub.org/History/images/19360727-July271936.jpg}}</ref> He also entered the competition at [[Lowestoft]] in 1937 and at Falmouth in 1938.<ref> Hichens, pp.20&ndash;21</ref> Hichens had also taken up [[Yacht racing|offshore yacht racing]] and was a member of the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]],<ref name=cook43>Cook, p.43</ref> competed three times in the [[Fastnet race]], and crewed in the Channel race in June 1939.<ref name=h21>Hichens, p.21</ref>

===Motor racing===
In 1935, he purchased a 1.4 litre [[Aston Martin]] [[touring car]] and a [[Riley (motorcar)|Riley]] which he used to compete in [[hillclimbing|hill climbs]] at Beggers Roost in [[Somerset]].<ref name=h21/> Then in 1936, he purchased a 2 litre Aston Martin Speed Model<U+2014>one of six built for the Ulster TT and [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] race that year.<ref>Hichens, P.22</ref> With assistance from Aston Martin he entered the car for the [[1937 24 Hours of Le Mans]], with Mortimer Morris-Goodall as his co-driver. They finished eleventh place overall but did win the Rudge Whitworth Cup.<ref>{{cite web|title=Le Mans results 1937|accessdate=2009-November-27|publisher=Experiance Le Mans in French|url=http://www.experiencelemans.com/contents/en-us/d188.html}}</ref>  They competed again in the [[1938 24 Hours of Le Mans]] but did not finish.<ref>{{cite web|title=Le Mans results 1938|publisher=Experiance Le Mans in French|accessdate=2009-November-27|url=http://www.experiencelemans.com/contents/en-us/d187.html}}</ref> They returned for the [[1939 24 Hours of Le Mans]] where they finished twelfth.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-November-27|title=Le Mans results 1939|publisher=Experiance Le Mans in French|url=http://www.experiencelemans.com/contents/en-us/d186.html}}</ref>

==Second World War==
Robert Hichens applied to transfer from the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] to the [[RNVR]] in the summer of 1930, and eventually joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Supplementary Reserve in 1936, which was formed from yachtsmen sufficiently knowledgeable about the sea to be considered suitable for a commission.<ref>Hichens, p.28</ref> After the declaration of war he was ordered to join [[HMS King Alfred|HMS ''King Alfred'']] on 27 October 1939, and after passing an interview and medical was promoted to [[sub lieutenant]] RNVR, completing his training in six weeks instead of the normal three months.<ref>Hichens, pp.30&ndash;31</ref>

===Phoney war and Dunkirk===
[[File:HMS Niger(J73).jpg|alt=stationary ship at sea with flags blowing in the wind|thumb|550px|HMS ''Niger'']]
Having completed training in December 1940, he was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and appointed to [[HMS Halcyon (J42)|HMS ''Halcycon'']], part of the 5th Minesweeping Flotilla and later the 4th Minesweeping Flotilla.<ref>Hichens, pp.33&ndash;38</ref> He moved ship to [[HMS Niger (J73)|HMS ''Niger'']] in April 1940,<ref>Hichens, p.53</ref> during the [[Phoney war]] period both [[flotilla]]s were kept busy [[minesweeping]] in the [[North Sea]] and the only action seen was on 15 May 1940, when [[HMS Hussar (1934)|HMS ''Hussar'']] was holed by a German bomber.<ref>Hichens, pp.65&ndash;67</ref> On 29 May 1940, Hichens was informed that the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] were being evacuated from [[Dunkirk]] in [[Operation Dynamo]] and that ''Niger'' would be leaving to assist.<ref>Hichens, p.69</ref> Arriving off Dunkirk on 31 May, Hichens organised the small boats and yachts used to evacuate the army from the Dunkirk jetty. When ''Niger'' was ordered home with a full complement of soldiers, Hichens asked to be left  behind to continue with the evacuation. He was given permission but also informed he would have to find his own way home. Arriving back in [[Dover]] on the yacht ''Chico'' he rejoined ''Niger'' on 1 June. HMS ''Niger'' returned to Dunkirk another three times, Hichens once more went ashore to arrange the evacuation before the end of the operation.<ref>Hichens, pp.71&ndash;85</ref>  For his work on the beaches in the withdrawal of the Allied armies from Dunkirk, Hichens was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]] (DSC).<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=34925|date=16 August  1940|startpage=5064|endpage= |supp= |accessdate=2009-November-25|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/34925/pages/5064/page.pdf}}</ref>

===Coastal forces===
[[File:Motor Gun Boat 64.jpg|left|alt=motor gun boat sailing at speed from left to right|thumb|400px|MGB 64 at this stage of the war armed with twin Lewis guns alongside the bridge and a four barrelled Boulton Paul gun turret aft.]] 
Having asked for a transfer to [[Coastal Forces of  the Royal Navy|Coastal Forces]] Hichens was sent to [[RNAS Portland (HMS Osprey)|HMS ''Osprey'']] at [[Weymouth and Portland|Portland]] for training on [[British Power Boat Company|Motor Anti-Submarine Boats]] (MASB).<ref name=lr29/> He was appointed to his first command, MASB 16, on 4 November 1940, which he held until 18 November 1940, when he was appointed commander of MASB 18. His final MASB command was MASB 14, which he took up 23 December 1940.<ref>Hichens, p.110</ref>  
These boats were lightly armed with two twin [[Vickers .50 machine gun]]s and [[depth charges]] and had a top speed of 40 [[Knot (unit)|Knots]].<ref name=lr29/>  

In January 1941, Hichens was given a new command, [[Motor Gun Boat]] 64,<ref>Cook, p.46</ref> becoming the first RNVR officer to command a MGB, and the only RNVR crewed boat in the 6th MGB Flotilla.<ref name=hi126>Hichens, p.126</ref> It was when in command of MGB 64 that Hichens got his nickname ''Hitch''. As each boat needed to select a radio call sign, Hichens could not think of anything suitable and Lieutenant Arty Shaw suggested ''Hitch'', which stuck and remained with him for the rest of his time with the coastal forces.<ref>Hichens, p.134</ref>    

The 6th MGB Flotilla was based at [[HMS Beehive|HMS ''Beehive'']] in [[Felixstowe]] from April 1941, where they were tasked to engage German [[E boat]]s raiding east coast convoys.<ref>Hichens, pp.141&ndash;145</ref> At this stage in the war MGBs were armed with a mixture of weapons, which could be [[Lewis machine gun]]s, [[Vickers machine gun]]s, [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon]] or [[Boulton Paul Aircraft#Boulton Paul gun turrets|four barrelled Boulton Paul gun turrets]]. The armament was soon standardized with two twin Vickers .50 machine guns each side of the bridge, an Oerlikon 20 mm cannon mounted aft, and depth charges.<ref>Hichens, pp.153&ndash;156</ref> The boats had a crew of 18, consisting of two officers, two [[petty officer]]s and 14 [[Naval rating|rating]]s.<ref name=lr29>Lambert & Ross, p.29</ref>

===Flotilla commander===

When Robert Hichens was appointed senior officer in command of the 6th MGB Flotilla from September 1941,<ref>Reynolds, p.46</ref> he became the first RNVR officer to command a flotilla in the Second World War.<ref>Reynolds, p.97</ref> Along with the new command came a promotion to [[lieutenant commander]].<ref>Hichens, p.167</ref>  

As flotilla commander his first successful action took place the night of 19/20 November 1941.<ref>Scott, p.35</ref> Ordered to patrol {{convert|10|mi}} off the [[Hook of Holland]] to engage [[E boat]]s returning to base.<ref>Hichens, p.181</ref> The flotilla engaged five E boats, causing damage to all five boats, damaging two severely and forcing them to disperse. One E boat was later found abandoned by the crew and boarded.<ref>Cook, p.48</ref> This was the first E boat captured and Hichens' crew obtained valuable information and equipment before the boat sank.<ref>Hichens, pp.191&ndash;199</ref>{{#tag:ref|After the war it was discovered that two E boats had been lost that night, S41 and S53. S41 was the boat that was boarded.<ref>Hichens, p.200</ref>|group=nb}} For this action Hichens was awarded a bar to the DSC, for "...[c]oolness skill and readiness when in action against enemy E boats sinking one and damaging others".<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35449|date=6 February 1942|startpage=653|endpage= |supp=y |accessdate=2009-November-25|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/35780/supplements/4883}}</ref>
Other members of the flotilla were awarded one [[Distinguished Service Medal (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Medal]] (DSM) and five others were [[Mentioned in Dispatches]] (MID) for the action.<ref>Hichens, p.201</ref>

The flotilla's second success was the night of 19/20 December 1941, again in the North Sea off the Dutch coast, when two boats engaged two [[R boats]] and one E boat. They passed twice at high speed before losing contact, but twice during the night they located them and eventually carried out depth charge attacks.<ref>Hichens, pp.202&ndash;203</ref> Hichens received a MID for this action,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35474|date=3 March 1942|startpage=1009|endpage= |supp=y |accessdate=2009-November-25|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/35474/supplements/1009}}</ref> the commander of the other boat was also MID.<ref>Hichens, p.203</ref>     

The third major action Hichens was involved in during this period was the action during the night of 21/22 April 1942, off [[Ostend]], when they engaged six E boats, forcing the superior force to scatter and run for port after severely damaging one boat and causing slight damage to the others.<ref>Reynolds, p.49</ref> After this action the E boats were moved to a safer harbour to operate from.<ref>Hichens, pp.212&ndash;223</ref>  Hichens was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) following this action.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35780|date=10 November 1942|startpage=4883|endpage= |supp=y |accessdate=2009-November-25|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/35780/supplements/4883}}</ref>

===8th MGB Flotilla===
[[File:Motor Gun Boat 314.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Boat at sea moving from right to left, the crew can be seen manning the guns and on the bridge|[[Motor Gun Boat]] of the type used by the 8th MGB Flotilla]]
Hichens was next appointed commander of the 8th MGB Flotilla.<ref>Lambert & Ross, p.202</ref> These new boats were heavier armed with a twin Oerlikon mount aft, a [[QF 2 pounder naval gun#QF 2-pounder Mark XIV|QF 2-pounder Mark XIV]] forward, twin Lewis or later twin Vickers machine guns either side of the bridge and depth charges.<ref>Lambert & Ross, p.81</ref> The flotilla was moved to [[Dartmouth, Devon]] in July 1942.<ref>Scott, p.77</ref> The first action they were involved in was during the night of 14/15 July. Ordered to engage E Boats using [[Cherbourg]] as a base they found a [[convoy]] of [[naval trawler]]s escorting a small [[tank ship|tanker]]. The flotilla engaged the two rear escort trawlers and carried out a depth charge attack. The tanker was last seen to be on fire as the flotilla reformed off [[Alderney]].<ref>Hichen, pp.257&ndash;259</ref> After this action Hichens was awarded a bar to the DSO.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35695|date=8 September 1942|startpage=3917|endpage= |supp=y |accessdate=2009-November-25|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/35695/supplements/3917}}</ref>
Both the DSO and the bar were presented during the same investiture at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 22 September 1942, while other members of the flotilla were awarded a [[Conspicuous Gallantry Medal]] and four MID's for the action.<ref>Hichens, p.262</ref>{{#tag:ref|Hichens family legend recalls on one of his many investiture [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] is supposed to have joked "What you again".<ref>Hichens, p.310</ref>|group=nb}}
The flotilla was next in action during the night 29/30 July again off Ostend, when the flotilla in company with two [[Motor Torpedo Boat]]s (MTB) engaged a convoy of three [[Flak]] trawlers and two merchant ships. One of the merchant ships was hit by [[torpedo]]es from the MTBs while the MGBs engaged the other by dropping depth charges. With those ships destroyed they then engaged the Flak trawlers.<ref>Hichens, pp.242&ndash;244</ref>

During the night 1/2 August, under orders to patrol north west of [[Guernsey]], the flotilla again located enemy shipping. Following them towards the port of Cherbourg they silently passed a [[Torpedo boat type 35|German torpedo boat]] lying at anchor,{{#tag:ref|This vessel of about 600 tons was the same size as a small [[destroyer]] but they were unable to engage having nothing that would cause it any damage.<ref>Hichens, p.271</ref>|group=nb}} and located four E boats waiting to enter harbour. Having caught them by surprise they opened fire on the stationary boats and after  a short engagement withdrew leaving two of the enemy boats on fire.<ref>Hihens, pp.267&ndash;273</ref> For this action Hichens received a second MID, other members of the flotilla were awarded one DSC, two DSM's and four MID's.<ref>Hichens, p.274</ref>

The flotilla was ordered back to Felixstowe in Autumn 1942.<ref>Scott, p.115</ref> Their first contact with the enemy was on the night 14/15 September when they engaged a small convoy off the Hook of Holland. They followed a convoy that was escorted by four Flak trawlers almost into harbour before inflicting considerable damage to it.<ref>Reynolds, p.69</ref> For this, Hichens was awarded a second bar to the DSC.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35780|date=6 November 1942|startpage=4883|endpage= |supp=y |accessdate=2009-November-25|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/35449/supplements/653}}</ref> Other members of the flotilla were awarded one DSC, two DSM's and one MID.<ref>Hichens, p.288</ref>
 
Hichens, now the recipient of two DSOs, three DSCs and two MIDs, was offered promotion to [[commander]] in command of [[HMS Bee|HMS ''Bee'']] at [[Weymouth, Dorset]] and a training post ashore. Feeling unsuited for such a role, he declined and remained commander of the 8th MGB flotilla.<ref>Hichens, p.289</ref>

===Casualties===
The flotilla lost its first boat during the night action 2/3 October 1942. Engaging four trawlers MGB 78 went in for a depth charge attack and was lost to enemy fire.<ref>Hichens, pp.294&ndash;295</ref> Another boat, MGB 76, was lost during the night of 5/6 October 1942, when the flotilla was ambushed by two German torpedo boats and a number of E boats.<ref>Hichens, p.303</ref>

The winter months of 1942/43 were uneventful, and Hichens started to write his unfinished account of the war. ''We fought them in Gunboats'' was published posthumously in 1944.<ref>Hichens, p.310</ref>

The flotilla, accompanied by four MTBs and escorting mine laying [[Motor Launch]]es (ML), were next in action over the night of 27/28 February 1943.  The mixed flotilla engaged a convoy escorted by two trawlers and a minesweeper, and lost MGB 79 to enemy fire. Hichens closed with the stricken boat, which was on fire, to remove the crew. They managed to rescue seven of the crew before being forced to withdraw under fire. Hichens' own boat, MGB 77, was also set on fire during the rescue.<ref>Hichens, pp.315&ndash;320</ref>

On the night of 12/13 April 1943, the flotilla was ordered to escort mine laying MLs off the Dutch coast. Detecting two trawlers they engaged them leaving one on fire, but as they withdrew MGB 77 was hit, killing Hichens outright and wounding three others on the bridge.<ref>Hichens, pp.327&ndash;328</ref> Hichens received a [[posthumous recognition|posthumous]] MID for these actions.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=36062|date=18 June 1943|startpage=2819|endpage=|supp=y|accessdate=2009-November-27|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/36062/supplements/2819}}</ref>

==Victoria Cross recomendation==
Hichens was recommended for the [[Victoria Cross]] for his actions during the night of 27/28 February. When informed by his [[commanding officer]], Commander Kerr, of the intention to recommend him, Hichens requested that the recommendation be dropped as he now felt he had endangered two of the boats in the flotilla trying to rescue his friends. Kerr, respecting his views, dropped the recommendation, only for it to be resubmitted six weeks later after his death. The recommendation was endorsed by Commander Kerr, [[Admiral]] Lyon (the [[Commander-in-chief]] at [[Nore]]) and [[Rear admiral|Rear Admiral]] Rogers (the [[Flag officer]] in charge at [[Harwich]]). The recommendation was rejected by the Admiralty, citing the same reasons Hichens had himself given.<ref>Hichens, pp.322&ndash;334</ref>{{#tag:ref|After having decided that they were not going to award a Victoria Cross, under the British honours system at the time the only other option left to the authorities was a posthumous MID.<ref>Army Quarterly and Defence Journal (1994), p.23</ref>|group=nb}}
