In 1979, '''[[South Korea]]''' agreed to '''ballistic missile guidelines''', limiting the country<U+2019>s ballistic missile development and possession to 180&nbsp;km in range.<ref>{{cite news|last=<U+AE40>|first=<U+AD11><U+C218>|title=<U+D55C><U+AD6D> <U+BBF8><U+C0AC><U+C77C> <U+C0AC><U+AC70><U+B9AC> 800km<U+B85C> <U+B298><U+B9B0><U+B2E4>|url=http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/politics/201209/h2012092402340721000.htm|accessdate=11 July 2013|newspaper=<U+D55C><U+AD6D><U+C77C><U+BCF4>}}</ref>

In 2001, United States officials agreed to extend the range limit to 300&nbsp;km, which only applied to high-velocity, free flight ballistic missiles, excluding slower, surface-skimming cruise weapons.  South Korea developed an [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV) and [[cruise missile]] called [[Hyunmoo-3]]. The UAV would not have any limitation in range while the cruise missile<U+2019>s range was 1500 kilometers (930 miles).<ref>{{cite news|last=Choe|first=Sang-Hun|title=U.S. Agrees to Let South Korea Extend Range of Ballistic Missiles|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/world/asia/us-agrees-to-let-south-korea-extend-missile-range.html?_r=3&|accessdate=11 July 2013|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Eshel|first=Tamir|title=Hyunmoo Missiles <U+2013> Seoul Going Ballistic|url=http://defense-update.com/20120422_new_hyunmoo_korean_missiles.html|accessdate=11 July 2013|newspaper=Defense Update}}</ref>  South Korea's missile ranges were less than North Korea<U+2019>s missiles such as Rodong (1300 kilometer-ranged ballistic missile) and [[Taepodong-2]] (6000 kilometer-ranged intercontinental ballistic missile).<ref>{{cite news|last=Davenport|first=Kelsey|title=South Korea Extends Missile Range|url=http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2012_11/South-Korea-Extends-Missile-Range|accessdate=11 July 2013|newspaper=Arms Control Association}}</ref>

On October 6, 2012, after numerous caucuses between South Korea and the U.S., both agreed to extend the [[ballistic missile]] range to 800&nbsp;km. This was shorter than the range South Korea suggested (1000 kilometers) but much longer than the existing 300&nbsp;km limit.<ref>{{cite news|last=<U+C724>|first=<U+C0C1><U+D638>|title=<U+7F8E> <U+AD6D><U+BC29> "<U+D55C><U+AD6D> <U+BBF8><U+C0AC><U+C77C> <U+C0AC><U+AC70><U+B9AC> <U+C5F0><U+C7A5> <U+C0C1><U+B2F9><U+D55C> <U+C9C4><U+C804>"|url=http://news.donga.com/3/all/20120616/47052108/1|accessdate=11 July 2013|newspaper=DongA News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Dudley|first=Richard|title=US and South Korea Agree to Extend Missile Range|url=http://defense-update.com/20121008_us-and-south-korea-agree-to-extend-missile-range.html|accessdate=11 July 2013|newspaper=Defense Update}}</ref>

After the latest missile guideline extension, one particular Chinese media reported that South Korea<U+2019>s ballistic missiles would gain the capability to reach [[China]], [[Japan]], and [[Russia]] as well as [[North Korea]]. The media showed concerns over the possibility of a South Korean attack on [[Beijing]], should the South<U+2019>s missile range be extended. Another Chinese media outlet, Shinhwa, evaluated that the extension of the missile range as a violation against the [[Missile Technology Control Regime]] (MTCR).<ref>{{cite news|last=<U+BC15>|first=<U+D76C><U+C900>|title=<U+4E2D><U+C2E0><U+D654>"<U+D55C><U+AD6D> <U+D0C4><U+B3C4><U+BBF8><U+C0AC><U+C77C> <U+C0AC><U+AC70><U+B9AC> <U+C5F0><U+C7A5><U+C740> MTCR<U+C704><U+BC30>"|url=http://view.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2012100715340010694&nvr=Y|accessdate=11 July 2013|newspaper=<U+C544><U+C2DC><U+C544><U+ACBD><U+C81C>}}</ref>  Japan raised concerns of heightened resistance by North Korea.<ref>{{cite news|last=<U+BC15>|first=<U+CCA0><U+C6D0>|title=<U+C77C>, <U+D55C><U+AD6D> <U+BBF8><U+C0AC><U+C77C> <U+C0AC><U+AC70><U+B9AC> <U+C5F0><U+C7A5><U+C5D0> "<U+ACBD><U+ACC4>"|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=034&aid=0002430342|accessdate=11 July 2013|newspaper=YTN}}</ref>  The Russian Department of External Affairs opposed the extension of South Korea<U+2019>s missile range, through the column of Alexander Lukashcvich, spokesperson of Department of External Affairs.<ref>{{cite news|title=<U+B7EC><U+C2DC><U+C544>, <U+D55C><U+AD6D> <U+BBF8><U+C0AC><U+C77C> <U+C0AC><U+AC70><U+B9AC> <U+C5F0><U+C7A5><U+C5D0> <U+C6B0><U+B824> <U+D45C><U+BA85>(<U+C885><U+D569>)|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=100&oid=001&aid=0005862167|accessdate=11 July 2013|newspaper=<U+C5F0><U+D569><U+B274><U+C2A4>}}</ref>  [[North Korea]] stated that they would strengthen their military force in response to the extension.
