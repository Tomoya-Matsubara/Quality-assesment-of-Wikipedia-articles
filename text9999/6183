He is a versatile [[Striker|second striker]] who can also play as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]] and [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]].

==Club career==
Arshavin graduated from Smena football school. In 1999 and early 2000 he played for Zenit's [[farm club]], Zenit-2, in the [[Russian Second Division|Second Division]].

In 2000, he was included in the [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit]] squad, making his debut in a 3&ndash;0 away win over English side [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] in the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]].<ref>{{cite news

|publisher=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> He played in various positions on the field, starting as a right midfielder, then as an attacking midfielder and finally adopted the second striker's role playing on a flank or behind a target man. He won the [[Russian Premier League]] Award for the player of the season largely because of his ability to play well as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]], [[playmaker]] and as a [[striker]].

In the 2007 [[Russian Premier League]] season Arshavin guided his [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit St Petersburg]] side to the title, starting all 30 matches - scoring 10 goals and providing 11 assists along the way. It was the club's first league title since claiming the now defunct Soviet Top League in 1984. He was a key player during Zenit's [[2008 UEFA Cup]] triumph and was named [[Man of the Match]] in the [[2008 UEFA Cup Final|final]].

In October 2008, Arshavin was nominated for the prestigious [[Ballon d'Or]] award, along with 29 others including compatriot [[Yuri Zhirkov]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/7678835.stm|title=England trio on Euro award list |publisher=BBC|date=2008-10-19|accessdate=2008-10-19}}</ref>

Arshavin's performances in the [[UEFA Cup]] and [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championship]] brought him to the attention of several European clubs. In June 2008 [[FC Barcelona]] had their <U+20AC>15m offer for the player turned down by Zenit.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/sports/20080626/112270034.html|title=Barcelona offer 15 mln euros for Russian star Arshavin|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=2008-06-26|accessdate=2009-01-24}}</ref> [[Tottenham Hotspur|Tottenham]]'s <U+00A3>16m offer in August, also fell short of matching Zenit's <U+00A3>22m asking price.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/7589344.stm|title=Arshavin's Spurs move 'ruled out'|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2008-08-29|accessdate=2009-01-24}}</ref> Zenit's unwillingness to release the player for anything less than the initial asking price, caused discontent from both Arshavin, who said the 2008 season was definitely going to be his last with Zenit,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.russiatoday.com/sports/news/33000|title=I won<U+2019>t play for Zenit again <U+2013> Arshavin|publisher=Russia Today|date=2008-10-07|accessdate=2009-01-24}}</ref> and his agent Dennis Lachter who described the club's transfer policy as "barbaric".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1126435/Zenit-just-barbaric-says-Arshavin-agent-Arsenal-deal-hangs-balance.html?ITO=1490|title=Zenit are just 'barbaric' says Arshavin agent, as Arsenal deal hangs in the balance|publisher=Daily Mail|date=2009-01-22|accessdate=2009-01-24}}</ref>

In January 2009, Zenit rejected Arsenal's offer of [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]10m for Arshavin transfer. Arsenal's manager [[Ars<U+00E8>ne Wenger]] remained "very hopeful" the club would sign Arshavin before the end of the January transfer window.<ref name="Wenger hopeful">{{cite web

On transfer deadline day Andrei Arshavin had flown into [[England]] and was staying in a [[Hertfordshire]] hotel, just a few miles from the Arsenal training ground. At around 10am,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.skysports.com/football/transfer_clockwatch/0,23710,14896,00.html| title=Deadline Day Clockwatch| publisher=Sky Sports| date=2009-02-02| accessdate=2009-02-02}}</ref> he left the hotel and was rumoured to be heading back to Russia, but with less than an hour of the transfer window left a bid from Arsenal was accepted at long last by [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit]]. Also, he had agreed personal terms and passed a medical. However, a payoff sum by Arshavin himself to Zenit was supposedly holding up the deal.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/7831046.stm| title=Arshavin agent hopeful over move| publisher=BBC Sport| date=2009-02-02| accessdate=2009-02-02}}</ref>

==International career==
[[Image:A-Arshavinntkit.jpg|thumb|upright|Arshavin, playing for the national team.]] 
Arshavin debuted for the Russian national team on May 17, 2002 in a match against [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]]. His first goal with the squad came in a [[Exhibition game|friendly match]] versus [[Romania national football team|Romania]] on February 13, 2003 and since, he has managed to score in every competition which Russia has participated in. He was Russia's captain in a [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] qualifier against [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]].

===UEFA Euro 2008===

Arshavin was included in [[Russia national football team|Russia's]] [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] squad by manager [[Guus Hiddink]], despite being unable to play in the first two group matches due to suspension.<ref name="Arshavin banned for two Russia games">{{cite news

In the next match, the [[UEFA Euro 2008 knockout stage#Netherlands vs Russia|quarter-final]] against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], Arshavin repeated the feat with his part in Russia's two goals in the second half of extra time, providing the cross for [[Dmitri Torbinski]]'s goal and scoring his own four minutes later. Russia consequently reached the semi-finals with a 3&ndash;1 victory. For both of these games, [[UEFA]] awarded him [[Man of the Match]]. Arshavin could not repeat the heroics in the semi-final against eventual winners [[Spain national football team|Spain]], which [[Russia national football team|Russia]] lost 3&ndash;0. Despite this, Arshavin was named in [[UEFA]]'s squad for [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]].<ref name="Team of Euro 2008">{{cite news | title = Spain dominate Team of the Tournament | url = http://en.euro2008.uefa.com/news/kind=1/newsid=729372.html#spain+dominate+team+tournament | publisher = euro200.uefa.com | date = 2008-06-30 | accessdate = 2008-07-01}}</ref>
