The Lions' current [[Ace (baseball)|staff ace]], Wakui pitched for the [[Japan national baseball team|Japanese national team]] in the [[Baseball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]] and [[2009 World Baseball Classic]].<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sb20081113j1.html] "Lions prepare for trip into uncharted waters" - The Japan Times.</ref><ref>[http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/minors/news/2007/265174.html] "Chunichi Breaks Long Title Drought" - Baseball America.</ref>

==Early life and high school career==
===Early life===
Wakui was born in [[Matsudo, Chiba|Matsudo]], a large [[city]] in [[Chiba Prefecture]]. He played [[softball]] in [[elementary school]] and began playing [[baseball]] in [[Middle school|junior high]] for Matsudo Senior.
===2002 to 2003===
Wakui went on to [[Yokohama]] Senior High School<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sb20081103j2.html] "Surprise package Wakui takes playoffs by storm" - The Japan Times.</ref>, the [[alma mater]] of current [[Boston Red Sox]] [[pitcher]] [[Daisuke Matsuzaka]] and a baseball powerhouse that had sent more players to the [[Professional baseball|pros]] than any other [[high school]] in Japan except PL Gakuen Senior High. There, he played in the 75th [[National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament]] in {{By|2003}} alongside then-ace and current [[Chiba Lotte Marines]] [[Left-handedness|left-hander]] [[Yoshihisa Naruse]] (who was a [[Calendar year|year]] older than Wakui) in the spring of his second year (the equivalent of [[eleventh grade]] in the United States). Wakui was chosen to start in the [[Single-elimination tournament|tournament]] [[Final (competition)|finals]] despite having pitched only in [[Relief pitcher|relief]] up until then, but gave up six [[Run (baseball)|runs]] in just 3 2/3 [[Innings#Baseball|innings]] to Koryo High School, who, led by current [[Yomiuri Giants]] pitcher [[Kentaro Nishimura]], won in a 15-3 rout.<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sb20030404a1.html] "Koryo humbles Yokohama in Koshien final" - The Japan Times.</ref>

===Summer 2004===
In {{By|2004}}, Wakui led his team to another berth in a [[High school baseball in Japan|national tournament]] in his [[Twelfth grade|senior year]], this time the 86th [[National High School Baseball Championship]] held in the summer at [[Koshien Stadium]]. He pitched a 10-[[strikeout]] [[complete game]] [[Win (baseball)|win]] in Yokohama Senior High's first-round match against Hotoku Gakuen High School; an 11-inning, 14-strikeout complete game [[Shutout#Baseball|shutout]] in an thrilling 1-0 win in [[extra innings]] over Kyoto Gaidai Nishi High School (an affiliate school of [[Kyoto University of Foreign Studies]]) in the second round; and a 12-strikeout complete game win over Meitoku Gijuku Senior High School in the third round<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sb20040818a3.html] "Chiba Keizaidai reaches quarters" - The Japan Times.</ref>, clocking speeds as high as {{convert|147|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} with his [[fastball]]. However, he was no match for [[Komazawa University#Affiliated Schools|Komazawa University Tomakomai High School]] in the quarter-finals, giving up 14 [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] and six runs (five [[Earned run|earned]]) and allowing [[second baseman]] Yuya Hayashi to [[Hitting for the cycle|hit for the cycle]] en rout to a 6-1 loss.

===Fall 2004===
In the Sainokuni Magokoro [[National Sports Festival of Japan|National Sports Festival]] held that [[Autumn|fall]], the last national tournament of his high school career, Wakui avenged his earlier [[Loss (baseball)|loss]] against Tomakomai High by pitching a 14-strikeout complete game win in the first round. Yokohama Senior High went on to become the tournament champions.

Wakui was picked in the first round of the {{npby|2004}} [[Nippon Professional Baseball|NPB]] [[Draft (sports)|amateur draft]] by the [[Saitama Seibu Lions#Seibu Lions (1979-2007)|Seibu Lions]]<ref>[http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2008/03/25/paper_lions/?page=full] "Paper Lions: Despite windfall, Seibu has struggled without Matsuzaka" - The Boston Globe.</ref> and later given the [[Squad number|uniform number]] '''16'''. His repertoire at the time included a {{convert|148|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} fastball and a hard [[slider]].

==Professional career==
===2005 to 2006===
Wakui was named to the Lions' ''ichigun'' (Japanese equivalent of "major [[Sports league|league]]") roster for their [[Season (sports)|season]] opener in his [[rookie]] season ({{npby|2005}}), earning the first win of his professional career on June 18 in the last interleague game of the season against the [[Tokyo Yakult Swallows|Yakult Swallows]]. However, he finished the year with just a 1-6 [[Pitchers of record|record]] and a 7.32 [[Earned run average|ERA]], giving up 11 home runs in 55 1/3 [[Innings pitched|innings]].

On March 26 {{npby|2006}}, his first start of the season, Wakui earned a win against the [[Orix Buffaloes]] with [[Ginjiro Sumitani]] behind the plate (an 18-year-old rookie [[catcher]] straight out of high school), marking the first time a pitcher and catcher both in their [[Teen (disambiguation)|teens]] had won a game in Japanese professional baseball since [[Takuro Ishii|Tadanori Ishii]] (now Takuro Ishii) and [[Motonobu Tanishige]] accomplished the feat for the [[Yokohama BayStars#Yokohama Taiyo Whales (1978-1992)|Yokohama Taiyo Whales]] in {{By|1989}}.<ref>[http://www.japanbaseballdaily.com/pacificleague3-26-2006.html] "Pacific League Report: 3-26-2006" - Japan Baseball Daily.</ref> The two combined for another win on April 23 against the [[Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles]], the first complete game win as well as the first shutout of Wakui's career.

Wakui finished his sophomore season with a respectable 12-8 record, 3.24 ERA and 136 strikeouts in 178 innings pitched. He went 3-1 in June, earning [[Pacific League]] [[Most Valuable Player]] honors for that [[month]], and made his first [[Nippon Professional Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] appearance via [[Manager (baseball)|manager]] selection.

===2007===
On April 3 {{npby|2007}}, in the fifth inning of a regular season game against the [[Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks]], Wakui became just the 12th pitcher in NPB history to accomplish the unusual feat of striking out four batters in one inning.

He finished the season with a 17-10 record, leading the league in wins for the first time.<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sb20070920j1.html] "Darvish backed up by offense as Fighters down Eagles" - The Japan Times.</ref> He also led both Pacific and [[Central League|Central]] leagues in innings pitched (213) and hits allowed (199) and came second to only [[Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters]] ace [[Yu Darvish]] in complete games (11).

That year, Wakui was named to the Japanese national team to play in the [[2007 Asian Baseball Championship]] (which also functioned as the Asian qualifying tournament for the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]]). He and fellow 21-year-old Darvish, who had both been chosen to the national team for the first time, were the youngest members of the team. Wakui started in the Japan's first game against the [[Philippines national baseball team|Philippines]] and held them to just one hit over six shutout innings (Japan won the game 10-0 in seven innings as per the [[mercy rule]]).<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sb20071202w1.html] "Japan cruises to easy victory" - The Japan Times.</ref>

===2008===
In {{npby|2008}}, Wakui was named the starter for the Lions' season opener for the first time in his career. He took the mound in their season opener against the Buffaloes on March 20, but incurred the loss desite throwing 140 pitches and holding the Buffaloes to two runs over eight innings.

Wakui was selected to the national team to play in the Olympics, starting in the game against [[Chinese Taipei national baseball team|Chinese Taipei]] in the [[Baseball at the 2008 Summer Olympics#Group stage|group stage]] on August 14<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/travel/cruises/item.aspx?type=photo&photo_id=03cVbux5jH6Ye&tid=0aeWfNK8W1aA2&pn=5] "Cruise Log: Hideaki Wakui of Japan pitches against Taiwan in their baseball game during the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games" - USA Today.</ref> and holding them to one run over six innings in earning the win.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2008/boxscores/baseball/BBM400908.html] "Beijing 08: Box Score" - SI.com.</ref> He followed up the effort with a two-hit, complete game (seven innings due to mercy rule) shutout against [[China national baseball team|China]] on August 19.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/baseball/story/2008/08/19/olympics-baseball-canada-dutch.html] "Canada out of medal contention in baseball" - CBC Sports.</ref><ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sb20080820w1.html] "Japan wins in rout to advance to semifinals" - The Japan Times.</ref> However, he had a down year overall, going just 10-11 in the regular season and posting an ERA (3.90) and [[Walks plus hits per inning pitched|WHIP]] (1.29) that were both worse than that of his 2007 season.

Nevertheless, Wakui took the hill in Game 1<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sb20081018j1.html] "Hot-hitting Lions crush Fighters in series opener" - The Japan Times.</ref> and Game 5 of the Pacific League [[2008 Nippon Professional Baseball season#Pacific League|Climax Series]] ([[playoffs]]) against the Fighters, winning both starts and giving up just one run over 15 combined innings. In particular, he did not allow a single [[Baserunning#Becoming a runner|baserunner]] until two outs in the seventh inning in the latter game, finishing with a three-hit, complete game shutout and clinching a berth in the [[2008 Japan Series|Japan Series]] for the Lions.<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sb20081023j1.html] "Wakui-led Lions nab spot in Japan Series" - The Japan Times.</ref> He was named the Pacific League Climax Series MVP. He pitched in three games in the [[Japan Series]], starting Game 1<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sb20081102j1.html] "Wakui tosses gem for Lions in opener" - The Japan Times.</ref> and Game 5 and even coming on in relief in Game 7 on two [[day]]s' rest<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sb20081111j1.html] "Strength in relief gives pitch-perfect Lions win" - The Japan Times.</ref> to a key role in the Lions' championship (though he gave up six runs in 16 1/3 innings).

Wakui accepted the team's offer to change his uniform number from 16 to '''18''' during the [[Season (sports)#Off-season|off-season]], a number that denotes the team's ace pitcher in Japan. The last player to wear the number for the Lions was Matsuzaka, who pitched for the team between {{By|1999}} and 2006.  The number change also allowed teammate [[Kazuhisa Ishii]] to change from #61(which he wore in 2008) to the #16 he wore for his entire career with the [[Yakult Swallows]].

===2009===
Wakui was named to the national team to play in the 2009 [[World Baseball Classic]].<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2009-03-05-wbc-japan-cap_N.htm] "Defending champions fielding younger team" - USA Today.</ref><ref>[http://www.npbtracker.com/2009/02/wbc-roster-set/] "WBC Roster Set" - NPB Tracker.</ref> He pitched in three games as a [[Middle relief pitcher|middle reliever]], going 1-0 with a 2.70 ERA and contributing to Japan's second consecutive tournament title. He carried over his performance into the {{npby|2009}} regular season, going 3-1 with a 2.10 ERA in the month of April. In particular, he held the Marines to one run while [[List of baseball jargon (G)#go the distance|going the distance]] in a 12-strikeout, complete game win on April 24<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sb20090425j1.html] "Clutch hitting ignites Dragons to win over Giants" - The Japan Times.</ref>, striking out every batter in the Marines' lineup at least once and recording at least one strikeout in every inning (the first time in ''league history'' that a pitcher had accomplished the two feats in the same game). He allowed just four hits en route to his first complete game shutout in two years on May 15 against the Marines.<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sb20090516j1.html] "Fighters' Darvish nabs fifth consecutive win" - The Japan Times.</ref>

==Pitching style==
Wakui is a {{cm to in|185|abbr=yes|ft=yes}}, {{kg to lb|85|abbr=yes}} [[Right-handedness|right-handed]] pitcher with an [[Pitcher#Pitching in a game|overhand]] delivery. While his mechanics are well-balanced and mostly conventional, one unique trait in his delivery is how he completely straightens his left leg in a diagonal direction after raising it (and before dropping and driving towards the [[Baseball field#Home plate|plate]]).

Wakui throws an only average fastball<ref>[http://insider.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=3973546&name=law_keith] Law, Keith. "Breaking down a few of Team Japan's players" - ESPN.</ref>, a mostly flat [[Four-seam fastball|four-seamer]] that usually sits at {{convert|140|to|146|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and tops out at {{convert|151|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} (though it does have some late life due to its excellent backspin). However, he complements it with an extremely wide assortment of secondary pitches, including a [[slider]], [[Cutter (baseball)|cutter]], [[curveball]], [[forkball]], [[Circle changeup|changeup]] and a good [[Sinker (baseball)|sinker]]/[[shuuto]].<ref>[http://www.npbtracker.com/2009/04/velocity-charts/] "Velocity Charts" - NPB Tracker.</ref> He also has excellent command, posting a [[Bases on balls per 9 innings pitched|walks per nine innings]] rate of 2.11 in 2007 and 2.65 in 2008.
