Though the city itself was established only in the 17th century by the British, some parts of the city like [[Mylapore]] predate this by several centuries. The British on settling developed it into a major urban centre and naval base. By the 20th century, it had become an important administrative centre, as the capital of the [[Madras Presidency]].

Chennai's economy has a broad industrial base in the car, technology, hardware manufacturing, and healthcare industries. The city is India's second largest exporter of software, information technology ([[Information technology|IT]]) and information-technology-enabled services ([[Business process outsourcing|ITES]]). A major chunk of India's car manufacturing industry is based in and around the city.<ref name=itchennai1>{{cite news

Chennai is an important centre for [[Carnatic Music]] and hosts a large cultural event, the annual [[Madras Music Season]], which includes performances by hundreds of artists. The city has a vibrant theatre scene and is an important centre for the [[Bharatanatyam]], a classical dance form. The [[Tamil language|Tamil]] film industry, one of the largest film industries in India, is based in the city; the soundtracks of the films dominate its music scene.

== Names ==
The name ''Chennai'' is a shortened form of ''Chennaipattinam'', the name of the town that grew around [[Fort St. George (India)|Fort St. George]], which was built by the British in 1640.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wagret|first=Paul|title=India, Nepal|publisher=Nagel Publishers|location=Geneva|year=1977|series=Nagel's encyclopedia-guide|pages=556|isbn=9782826300236|oclc=4202160}}</ref> There are two versions about the origin of the name ''Chennai'': according to one version, ''Chennaipattinam'' was named after Chennaiappa Naicker, Raja of [[Srikalahasti|Kalahasthi]] and [[Vandavasi]] from whom the British acquired the town in 1639. The first official use of the name ''Chennai'' is said to be in a sale deed, dated August 1639, to [[Francis Day of Madras|Francis Day]] of the [[British East India Company]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chennai.tn.nic.in/chndistprof.htm#hist |title=District Pofile - CHENNAI |publisher=Chennai.tn.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2009-09-07}}</ref> According to the second account, ''Chennapattinam'' was named after the [[Chenna Kesava Perumal Temple]]; the word ''chenni'' in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] means ''face'', and the temple was regarded as the face of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2002/02/28/stories/2002022800030400.htm |title=The Hindu: Face behind the name |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date=2002-02-28 |accessdate=2009-09-07}}</ref>

The city's former name, ''Madras'', is derived from ''Madraspattinam'', a fishing village north of Fort St. George. There is little agreement among researchers about the exact origin of the name ''Madraspattinam''. Some believe that the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who arrived in the area in the 16th century, may have named the village ''Madre de Deus''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/yw/2007/08/31/stories/2007083150020100.htm |title=Young World: And the city grew |publisher=The Hindu |date=2007-08-31 |accessdate=2009-09-07}}</ref> Others believe that the village's name came from the once prominent ''Madeiros'' family (variously known as ''Madera'' or ''Madra'' in succeeding years) of Portuguese origin, which had consecrated the ''Madre de Deus'' Church in the Chennai locality, [[Santhome]], in 1575. It is uncertain whether the name 'Madraspattinam' was in use before European influence.

Some time after the British gained possession of the area in the 17th century, the two towns, ''Madraspattinam'' and ''Chennapattinam'', were merged. The British referred to the united town as ''Madraspattinam''. The state government officially [[Geographical renaming|changed]] it to ''Chennai'' in 1996, at a time when [[Renaming of cities in India|many Indian cities were being renamed]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/09/23/stories/2005092316520600.htm|title=Walkout in State Assembly|date=2005-09-23|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2008-09-05}}</ref><ref name=renamed>{{cite news |last = Tharoor|first = Sashi|title=In India's name game, cities are the big losers|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/06/opinion/06iht-edtharoor_ed3_.html?scp=1&sq=In%20India%27s%20name%20game,%20cities%20are%20the%20big%20losers%22&st=cse|work=International Herald Tribune|date=September 6, 2002|accessdate=2009-09-07}}</ref>

===Water===
Historically, Chennai has relied on annual [[monsoon]] rains to replenish water [[reservoir]]s, as no major rivers flow through the area. With a steadily increasing population, the city has faced [[water supply]] [[Water crisis|shortages]], and its ground water levels have been depleted. An earlier [[Veeranam|Veeranam Lake project]]  failed to solve the city's water problems, but the New Veeranam project, which became operational in September 2004, has greatly reduced dependency on distant sources.<ref name=ManagementWater2003-2004>{{cite web

Chennai city is governed by the [[Chennai Corporation|Corporation of Chennai]]. Established in 1688, it is the oldest municipal corporation not only in India, but also in any [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nation outside the United Kingdom. It consists of 155 [[councillors]] who represent [[List of Chennai Corporation wards|155 wards]] and are directly elected by the city's residents. From among themselves, the councillors elect a mayor and a deputy mayor who preside over about six standing committees.<ref name=corp>{{cite web

The area of jurisdiction of the Corporation of Chennai is set to expand manifold from its present extent of 176&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> to 800&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> pending a decision to be taken by the Government of Tamil Nadu. On doing this the population of Chennai is also set to increase from the present 4.5 million to over 8 million.

Chennai, the capital of the state of Tamil Nadu, houses the state [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[legislature|legislative]] headquarters primarily in the Secretariat Buildings on the [[Fort St George|Fort&nbsp;St&nbsp;George]] campus but also in many other buildings scattered around the city. The [[Madras High Court]], whose jurisdiction extends across [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Puducherry]], is the highest [[judicial]] authority in the state and is also in the city. Chennai has three [[Parliament of India|parliamentary]] constituencies <U+2014> [[Chennai North (Lok Sabha constituency)|Chennai North]], [[Chennai Central (Lok Sabha constituency)|Chennai Central]] and [[Chennai South (Lok Sabha constituency)|Chennai South]] <U+2014> and elects 14 Members of the Legislative Assembly ([[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLAs]]) to the state legislature.<ref>[http://www.assembly.tn.gov.in/const_map/map.htm List of TN Assembly constituencies]</ref>

The metropolitan region of Chennai covers many suburbs that are part of [[Kanchipuram]] and [[Thiruvallur]] districts.
