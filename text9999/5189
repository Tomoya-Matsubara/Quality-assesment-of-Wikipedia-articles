'''Gonadarche''' refers to the earliest [[gonad]]al changes of [[puberty]]. In response to [[pituitary gland|pituitary]] [[gonadotropin]]s, the [[ovary|ovaries]] in girls and the [[testis|testes]] in boys begin to grow and increase the production of the [[sex steroid]]s, especially [[estradiol]] and [[testosterone]]. 

* In boys, testicular enlargement is the first physical sign of gonadarche, and usually of [[puberty]].
* In girls, ovarian growth cannot be directly seen, so [[thelarche]] and growth acceleration are usually the first evidence of gonadarche.

Gonadarche should be contrasted with [[adrenarche]]. Gonadarche indicates that true central puberty has begun, while adrenarche is an independent maturational process only loosely associated with complete puberty.
