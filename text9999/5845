'''Gordon Eugene Smiley''' ([[April 20]], [[1946]] - [[May 15]], [[1982]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[race car driver]] from [[Omaha, Nebraska]] who was killed in a crash while attempting to qualify for the [[1982]] [[Indianapolis 500-Mile Race]]. While rounding Indianapolis Motor Speedway's third turn, his car began to [[oversteer]]. When Smiley steered right to correct this, the front wheels gained traction suddenly, sending his car head-on into the wall at nearly 200 mph.  The impact shattered and completely disintegrated the vehicle, which tumbled in pieces -- including Smiley's exposed body -- across the short-chute connecting turns 3 and 4. Smiley died instantly from massive internal trauma inflicted by the severe impact.  Smiley is the last driver to date who died at Indianapolis during a qualifying attempt.
