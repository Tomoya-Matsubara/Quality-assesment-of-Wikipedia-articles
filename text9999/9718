Schofield was drafted in the 4th round of the 2010 NFL Draft 130th overall by the Arizona Cardinals.  Since Schofield was injured, he was considered a good value because his talent level was near first round draft choice level.  He is expected to begin the [[2010 NFL season]] on the physically unable to perform list, but is expected to return late in the year as an outside linebacker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/04/24/cardinals-get-value-with-obrien-schofield/|title=Cardinals get value with O'Brien Schofield|accessdate=2010-05-04|date=2010-04-24|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|author=Rosenthal, Gregg}}</ref> Although he played on the [[defensive line]] in college, he is projected to play [[outside linebacker]] for the Cardinals who have [[Joey Porter]], [[Cody Brown]], and [[Will Davis (American football)|Will Davis]] on their roster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/tag/_/name/o%E2%80%99brien-schofield|title=What Schofield could offer Cardinals|accessdate=2010-05-04|date=2010-04-24|publisher=[[ESPN]]|author=Sando, Mike}}</ref>
