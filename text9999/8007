'''Lalji Singh''' (born 5 July 1947) is an Indian scientist who has worked in the field of [[DNA profiling|DNA fingerprinting Technology]] in India, where he is popularly known as the "Father of DNA fingerprinting". Singh has also worked in the areas of [[Sex-determination system|molecular basis of sex determination]], [[Conservation biology|Wildlife conservation]] forensics and [[Recent African origin of modern humans|evolution and migration of humans]]. In 2004, he received the [[Padma Shri]] in recognition of his contribution to Indian science and technology.

Singh founded various institutes and laboratories in India, including the [[Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics]] in 1995, Laboratory for the Conservation of Endangered Species (LaCONES) in 1998, and Genome Foundation in 2004, aiming to diagnose and treat genetic disorders affecting the Indian population, in particular the under-privileged people residing in rural India.

Singh also served as the 25th Vice Chancellor of [[Banaras Hindu University|Banaras Hindu University (BHU)]] and Chairman of Board of Governors of [[Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi|Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Varanasi]] from August 2011 to August 2014. Before his term as Vice Chancellor of Banaras Hindu University, he also served as director of the [[Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology]] (CCMB) from May 1998 to July 2009 and Officer on Special Duty (OSD) of [[Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics]] (CDFD), Hyderabad, India in 1995<U+2013>1999.

== Education and research career ==
=== Early life and education ===
Singh was born and raised in the small village of Kalwari in [[Uttar Pradesh]], India. His father, Suryanarayan Singh, was a farmer and used to serve as [[Sarpanch|head of the village]]. Singh completed his primary education till eighth standard in the Government school in Kalwari. However, there were no further education facilities in the village for senior classes and Singh was admitted at another school in the nearby village of Pratapganj, situated {{convert|6|-|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} from his village. After completing his twelfth standard in the science group from this school, Singh went to the Banaras Hindu University to complete his studies in zoology and [[cytogenetics]].<ref name="BioSpectrum">{{cite news|last1=Vaidya|first1=Manasi T.|last2=Singh|first2=Nandita|title=The Game Changer Geneticist|url=http://www.biospectrumindia.com/biospecindia/news/155909/the-game-changer-geneticist|accessdate=16 December 2014|website=www.biospectrumindia.com|publisher=[[BioSpectrum]]|date=9 December 2011}}</ref>

=== Molecular basis of sex determination ===
In 1982, Singh and his colleagues discovered that a tiny portion of the short arm of sex-determining [[Y chromosome]] was necessary and sufficient to convert a female mouse to male.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=L.|last2=Jones|first2=K.W.|title=Sex reversal in the mouse (Mus musculus) is caused by a recurrent nonreciprocal crossover involving the X and an aberrant Y chromosome|journal=Cell|date=1982|volume=28|page=205-2016|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(82)90338-5|url=http://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/0092-8674%2882%2990338-5.pdf}}</ref> This fundamental discovery provided a new concept of [[Chromosomal translocation]] of sex-determining region from Y chromosome to [[X chromosome]]s causing [[sex reversal]] in mice.

=== DNA based molecular diagnostics ===
Until 1998, India did not have an adequate facility for diagnosis of [[genetic disorder]]s, prevalent in the country. The fundamental research carried out by Singh and his colleagues in that area, led to conceptualization and establishment of the first DNA based diagnostic laboratory in the country.<ref>{{cite news|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=Genetic fingerprinting catches on|url=http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/content/4381/genetic-fingerprinting-catches-on/|accessdate=17 December 2014|website=www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in|publisher=[[Centre for Science and Environment]]|date=30 October 1992}}</ref> The lab later evolved into a separate institute, the [[Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics]] in Hyderabad, India to provide advanced DNA based molecular diagnostics services for the nation.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Somasekhar|first1=M.|title=DNA fingerprinting comes of age|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/dna-fingerprinting-comes-of-age/article3746620.ece|accessdate=17 December 2014|website=www.thehindubusinessline.com|publisher=[[Business Line|The Hindu: Business Line]]|date=9 August 2012}}</ref>

=== Novel insights into evolution and migration of humans ===
The fundamental DNA based research carried out by Singh and his colleagues on [[Indigenous peoples|primitive tribes]] including the tribal population of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]], provided critical insights into the evolution and migration of humans, suggesting the out of Africa route of modern humans about 60,000 years ago to the [[Andaman Islands]].<ref>{{cite news|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=DNA polymorphism provides insight into human origin|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dna-polymorphism-provides-insight-into-human-origin/article1506896.ece|accessdate=16 December 2014|website=www.thehindu.com|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=4 March 2011}}</ref> These findings have furthered the scientific community's understanding of the [[Anthropogeny|origin of man]] in terms of evolution and migration from place to place.<ref>{{cite news|last1=TNN|title=Aryan-Dravidian divide a myth: Study|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Aryan-Dravidian-divide-a-myth-Study/articleshow/5053274.cms|accessdate=16 December 2014|website=www.timesofindia.indiatimes.com|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|date=25 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Chellappan|first1=Kumar|title=New research debunks Aryan invasion theory|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-new-research-debunks-aryan-invasion-theory-1623744|website=www.dnaindia.com|accessdate=16 December 2014|publisher=DNA|date=10 December 2011}}</ref>

=== Genome Foundation ===
In 2004, Singh founded a non-profit research and service organization, the Genome Foundation, with the aim of diagnosing and treating [[genetic disorder]] affecting the Indian population, in particular the under-privileged people residing in rural India, with the participation and voluntary services of scientists and professionals.<ref name ="genomefoundation" /><ref>{{cite news|last1=Singh|first1=Lalit T.|title=Even a rupee can help fund its cause|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/even-a-rupee-can-help-fund-its-cause/article6686461.ece|accessdate=17 December 2014|website=www.thehindu.com|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=13 December 2014}}</ref>
