Originally Brighton Chamber Choir sang alongside the Brighton Youth Choir and it was not until 1991 that Brighton Chamber Choir gave it's first 'solo' performance. 

From 1995 until 2001, renowned tenor, Neil Jenkins<ref> [http://www.neiljenkins.com/conducting2/  Neil Jenkins]</ref> assumed the mantle 
of music director and reinforced the choir's aim "to develop, improve and promote choral 
music to the widest possible audience".  

[[Paul Brough]] took up the baton from 2001 until 2004  and under Paul's guidance, the choir commissioned and gave the first performance of <br /> 
[[Sir_John_Tavener|Sir John Tavener's]] ''Butterfly Dreams''<ref> [http://www.johntavener.com  Sir John Tavener] </ref> <br />

For a short time Christopher Larley followed [[Paul Brough]] as music director..<br />
