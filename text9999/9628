The '''2003 Afro-Asian Games''', officially known as the '''First Afro-Asian Games''' or '''I Afro-Asian Games''' and unofficially known as the '''Inaugural Afro-Asian Games''', was a major [[international]] [[multi-sport]] [[sporting event|event]] held in [[Hyderabad, India]],<ref name=host>{{cite web|url=http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/aag.htm|publisher=gbrathletics|title=Host city of 1st Afro-Asian Games|accessdate=2009-04-11}}</ref> from October 24 (excluding [[Football at the 2003 Afro-Asian Games|football]] and [[Field hockey|hockey]], which began on October 22 and October 23 respectively) to November 1, 2003.<ref name=rsch/>

The Afro-Asian Games was the largest sporting event ever to be held in Hyderabad, and one of the largest in India, second only to the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] by athletes' volume. The scale of these Games exceeds even the two [[Asian Games]] held in [[Delhi]] in [[1951 Asian Games|1951]] (both by athletes' volume and by number of participating nations) and [[1982 Asian Games|1982]] (by number of participating nations). More than 2000 athletes from 96 countries competed in the Games. A total of 131 [[sporting events]] in eight disciplines were conducted. Also, 120 countries sent 1,565 official representatives to these Games.

The First [[Afro-Asian Games]] were held after nearly two decades of delays, shifts and cancellations. The prolonged amount of time for these Games considerably reduced interest in them. After the preliminary decision of hosting the Games, the venue was shuttled between [[New Delhi]] and [[Kuwait City]]. At the last moment, New Delhi was outfavoured by [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], which had hosted the [[National Games of India]] in 2002.<ref name=NGI>{{cite web

These Games, however, had lesser scope than the [[Asian Games]] or [[Commonwealth Games]], since 96 nations participated in only eight disciplines. The Games witnessed only one new world record. Thirty-seven countries - an unprecedented 39% of the participating nations - won at least one medal in these Games.<ref name=medtal/>

==History==
The idea to hold an inter-continental sporting event between Asia and Africa was initiated in April 1983, with [[New Delhi]] as the proposed venue. However, for unknown circumstances, the venue was shifted to [[Kuwait]] and the Games were proposed to be held in 1985.<ref name=idek>{{cite web

In 1989, the proposal was reconsidered, with New Delhi again chosen as the venue for the Games.<ref name=idek/> The Games were then scheduled for 1991. The plans went wrong due to inefficient communication between the members, and so could not come into force.

In 1999, a proposal for the renewal of the Games was accepted. Subsequently, [[Pune]] and then [[New Delhi]] were proposed as venues.<ref name=idek/> However, they were postponed till November 2001.<ref name=orda>{{cite web

==Preparation==
[[File:Gachibowli hyderabad.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|A view of [[Gachibowli]], the [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabadean]] suburb which hosted the Games]]
The Indian Government spent {{Indian Rupee}} 1.03&nbsp;billion (US$ 22.92&nbsp;million),<ref name=orda/> for the Afro-Asian Games, making these Games one of the most expensive sporting events held in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]]. All preparations were completed within 60 days before the events began.<ref name=orda/>

===General Preparation===
The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) decided to set up a central head of the development for the Games. Thus, the Afro-Asian Games Secretariat was set up at the ''Greenlands Guest House''<ref name=orda/> to organize, monitor and manage all the activities related to the Games. 17 functional organizing sub-committees were formed to oversee the development of the venues and other infrastructure.<ref name=sub>{{cite web

A large development Planning Association meant a great amount of inter-connectivity and communication requirements. A 24-hour call centre with interpreters was set up, using a Closed User Group (CUG) circuit.

A large "web" of networking facilities was built to connect all the hotels, media centres, stadia and Transportation Committees.<ref name=orda/> This would help in easing pressure on any one committee. Since the African continent is not very well-connected, an Accreditation Committee was dispatched to [[Abuja]] - in [[Nigeria]] - the host city of the [[2003 All-Africa Games]].<ref name=orda/> The Accreditation committee brought all sports-persons and officials from Africa to [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]].

===Technology===
The software company [[CMC Limited]] had developed a Games and Event Management System (GEMS),<ref name=gems>{{cite web

}}</ref> which helped the organizers to efficiently manage events across the sports venues. It worked closely with [[Doordarshan]], the official television broadcasters of the Games, to provide results of sporting competitions and live Games information.<ref name=gems/> Additionally, cutting-edge technology like the implementation of geo-referenced maps and [[Geographic Information System]] (GIS) was implemented,<ref name=tech>{{cite web

===Transport===
In the month of September, less than a month away from the Afro-Asian Games, the Transport Ministry of Hyderabad released a large number of luxury vehicles, to be used in the Games. It was the second time in the span of one year that the Transport Ministry had done so - the first time being for the 32nd [[National Games of India]].<ref name=trsp>{{cite web

Accommodation of the athletes and foreign officials posed a serious problem to the organisers. Contrary to what the [[Olympics]] and related [[multi-sport events]] provide, no actual Games Village was available for the athletes to stay.<ref name=abs>{{cite web

It was estimated that about {{INR}} 800 million (US$ 16&nbsp;million) would be required to upgrade the existing Games Village.<ref name=gav>{{cite web

===Security===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Begumpet airport.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The now-defunct [[Begumpet Airport]]]] -->

About 1400 police personnel were drawn from various districts of Andhra Pradesh to provide the first layer of security. In addition to this, over 5000 city policemen were deployed in various places, including the event venues and all the major hotels of the city.<ref name=sec>{{cite web

}}</ref> Strict anti-sabotage measures were taken to provide security at the athlete hotels. Also, a 24-hour access control system was placed, with sniffer dogs used to sanitise the area.<ref name=sec/>

To facilitate foreign athletes and officials, four immigration counters were set up at the airport. A time limit of 30 minutes was laid down to clear any athlete or official. To improve security speed, six interpreters of [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[French language|French]] and [[Arabic]] were present at the airport. In addition, 24 specially trained immigration personnel were stationed round the clock in the airport.<ref name=sec/>

==Pressure on Organizing Committee==
There was a lot of pressure upon the Secretariat for the smooth performance of these Games, as the IOA would keenly observe the Afro-Asian Games, in preparation for the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] at [[Delhi]], India. Also, officials from [[Beijing]], China - the venue of [[2008 Summer Olympics]] - and [[Doha]], [[Qatar]] - the host of [[2006 Asian Games]] - would attend the Afro-Asian Games, and keenly observe the way the Games functioned.<ref name=orda/>

However, hosting of the Games was not the only major issue for the Committee. The Afro-Asian Games would see the participation of various nations which are not in good terms with some other nations. The then Prime Minister of India, [[Atal Behari Vajpayee]], had hinted that ''"some nations might withdraw from the Games, rather than get embroiled in international conflicts"''.<ref name=wtdw>{{cite web

;Sponsorships

Several Indian corporates such as [[Indian Oil Corporation]] (IOC), GVK Group and [[State Bank of Hyderabad]] provided sponsorships worth INR 10 million each towards the staging of several events of the inaugural Games.

===Qualification===
Qualification for the Games depended upon the performance of the countries in other major multi-sport events. Since these Games featured delegations from two continents, the qualification criteria for nations from the different continents was different. The qualification of the African nations was based on their performance in the [[2003 All-Africa Games]] held in [[Abuja]], [[Nigeria]].<ref name=qual>{{cite web

Chief Guest [[L K Advani]] declared the Games open. Shooter [[Anjali Bhagwat]] took the [[Athlete's Oath]].<ref name=crowd/> This was followed by a laser show, fireworks and a space cannon show. The highlight of the Opening ceremony was the ''Umojas''<ref name=crowd/> - a group of professional tribal dancers from Africa. There were other international showcases - the spiritual chanting by the [[China|Chinese]] monks, and the peace prayers by thousands of schoolchildren. Singer [[Shankar Mahadevan]] sang the theme song. Bollywood divas [[Shilpa Shetty]], [[Simran (actress)|Simran]] and [[Urmila Matondkar]] did dance performances.

Unlike the [[Olympic Games]], there was no individual march past for the countries. The countries came in batches of two - Asian countries in one batch and African countries in another.<ref name=jinxed/>

A "daredevil" act was done by a few service personnel, who came riding on motorcycles.<ref name=close/> A fly-past of the [[Indian Army]] airplanes, trailing smoke in the colours of the [[Indian flag]] took place as the dignitaries took their seats.

The expected "high-point" of the closing ceremony was the show of [[camaraderie]] between the sportspersons of the two continents. However, few athletes trooped into the Stadium for that purpose.<ref name=close/> The "camaraderie ceremony" was followed by speeches of various important people, among them being IOA President [[Suresh Kalmadi]], IOA and OCA Secretary-General [[Raja Randhir Singh]], ANOCA President [[Alfa Ibrahim Diallo]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] Chief Minister [[Chandrababu Naidu]] and Union Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports [[Vikram Verma]]. The speeches were shortly followed by a memento presentation.<ref name=close/>

As night fell, hundreds of Army recruits brought lighted torches, and did the "mashal dance". Laser lights and several technological innovations followed. Sheroo, the mascot, was bid farewell by noted Indian singer [[Hariharan (singer)|Hariharan]] and many costumed children. The ''Umojas'' performed yet again at the closing ceremony. The [[China|Chinese]] State circus was considered "breath-taking". [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] singer [[Diana Haddad]], [[Egypt]]ian singer [[Hisham Abbas]] and Indian singer [[Remo Fernandes]] performed at the closing ceremony as well.<ref name=close/>

The host country was portrayed by a number of traditional folk dances, after which the Games officially ended.

==Legacy==
The success of the Games was a point in favor of India being able to host a major international sporting event. Subsequently, this success was used in the bidding of the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]], which was ultimately awarded to [[Delhi]].<ref name=brds/><ref name=legc>{{cite web

In addition, the hospitality sector received a major boost due to the games, as hotels and guest houses received large booking orders from people who were coming to see the Games - media-persons, delegates, officials, visitors, sports-persons, etc. Tourism also benefited from the Games, and the State Tourism Department showed many foreign journalists key tourism spots in the city.<ref name=trhp>{{cite web

Also, famous local markets witnessed exceptional growth in sales and business, as demand peaked during the Games. Business of the world-renowned [[pearl]]s of Hyderabad increased by about 50%, generating revenue of {{INR}} 50 million in one week. The rise in buyers was mainly driven by African visitors, who prefer pearls as jewellery.<ref name=bsli>{{cite web
