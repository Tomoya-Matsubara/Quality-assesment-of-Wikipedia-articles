'''Ten Dollar Bill''' (also referred to as '''The Dollar Bill''') is a 1956 proto-[[pop art]] [[Lithography|lithographic]] drawing by [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. Considered to be a combination of [[Americana]] art and [[cubism]], the work is referred to as the beginning to Lichtenstein's work on pop art. 25 editions of the lithograph were made by Lichtenstein, which were exhibited at several galleries. The piece is based on the ten-dollar bill and has impacted several of Lichtenstein's later works. The picture has received generally favorable reception from critics, and is considered to be one of the best artistic portrayals of currency. 

==Background and history==

Roy Lichtenstein began experimentation with [[printmaking]] in the late 1940s, well before its rise in popularity in the early 1960s. Lichtenstein created his first lithograph and woodcut artwork in 1948, while he was working on receiving his graduate degree in fine arts from [[Ohio State University]].<ref name="Hendrickson page 10-11">{{cite book |title=Roy Lichtenstein |author=Hendrickson, Janis |publisher=[[Taschen]] |date=2006 |isbn=3-8228-9633-0 |pages=10-11 |chapter=The Beginnings}}</ref><ref name="Times Union part 1">[[#Times Union|Myers (1994)]], p.&nbsp;C1. "His printmaking work started out modestly enough. He produced his first lithograph and woodcut in 1948 while a graduate student at Ohio State University. Not long after, he began to experiment with combining different printing techniques"</ref> During the late 1940s, he created abstract paintings influenced by several artists, namely [[Pablo Picasso]]. From 1951 through early 1956, Lichtenstein painted "jagged, post-cubist" designs of famous American artworks. Many of his pieces reflected portraits of the American west, especially native Americans and cowboys, as well as other genres, such as works of president [[George Washington]]. The period is referred to by Lichtenstein as his "American" series, and was generally negatively received by critics.<ref name="Mercurio page 78">[[#Mercurio|Mercurio (2010)]], p.&nbsp;78</ref><ref name="Hendrickson page 12">{{cite book |title=Roy Lichtenstein |author=Hendrickson, Janis |publisher=[[Taschen]] |date=2006 |isbn=3-8228-9633-0 |pages=12 |chapter=The Beginnings}}</ref> However, during this period, Lichtenstein also began experimenting in abstract expressionism, using the technique on several of his western painting designs. However, they were poorly received, being called by one critic "like the doodling of a five-year old".<ref name="Pop Artists">{{cite book |last=Mason |first=Paul |year=2002 |title=Pop Artists: Artists in Profile |chapter=Roy Lichtenstein 1923-1997 |location=[[Chicago]] |publisher=Heinemann Raintree Library |page=27 |isbn=1-58810646-2}}</ref>

==Description==
Based on the design for the [[United States ten-dollar bill]], ''Ten Dollar Bill'' measures {{convert|14|by|28.6|cm}}, and is drawn on sheets of paper with dimensions of {{convert|42.8|by|57.6|cm}}.<ref name="Osterwold">[[#Osterwold|Osterwold (2003)]], p.&nbsp;36</ref> Classified as a proto-[[pop art]] work, the lithograph is considered to be "a Picasso-esque vision of what currency could look like", as well as a "humorous" combination of "established art forms and Americana".<ref name="Hendrickson page 12"/><ref name="Oregon"/> The drawing has the dimensions and shape of the ten-dollar bill, and completely covers the space needed, which has led to Lichtenstein being considered as "almost seeming to be forging money". The picture has been described as being a "brand-new bill of tender and not a picture of one".<ref name="Hendrickson page 12 part 2">{{cite book |title=Roy Lichtenstein |author=Hendrickson, Janis |publisher=[[Taschen]] |date=2006 |isbn=3-8228-9633-0 |pages=9, 12 |chapter=The Beginnings |quote=A lithograph of a ten-dollar bill (p. 9) that he made in 1956 shows just how humorous this marriage of established art forms and Americana could become. Lichtenstein almost seems to be forging money; his lithograph is a brand-new bill of tender and not a picture of one. The rectangular shape of the paper upon which the image is printed has about the same proportions as the currency}}</ref> The "schematic head" of the medallion portrait of [[Alexander Hamilton]], the prominent feature of the print, "shows him as a planar, anteater-like being" with a "hair-do of the young Picasso" and eyes similar to a "figure by [[Francis Picabia]].<ref name="Corlett">{{cite book |last=Corlett |first=Mary Lee |last2=Lichtenstein |first2=Roy |year=2002 |title=The Prints of Roy Lichtenstein: A Catalogue Raisonn<U+00E9> 1948-1997 |location=[[Easthampton, Massachusetts|Easthampton, MA]] |publisher=Hudson Hills Press |page=30 |edition=2nd |isbn=1-5559-5196-1}}</ref><ref name="page 12 part 3">{{cite book |title=Roy Lichtenstein |author=Hendrickson, Janis |publisher=[[Taschen]] |date=2006 |isbn=3-8228-9633-0 |pages=12 |chapter=The Beginnings |quote=However, the medallion portrait of President Hamilton shows him as a planar, anteater-like being with the hair-do of the young Picasso and a row of eyes like a figure by Francis Picabia}}</ref> The exterior framing for ''The Dollar Bill'' was "simplified" from the original dollar design, appearing in "an imbalanced, drunken fashion".<ref name="Hendrickson page 12"/>
