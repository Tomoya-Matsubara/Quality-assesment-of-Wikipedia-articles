'''Chester Farm''' is a [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] burial ground for the dead of the [[World War I|First World War]] located in the [[Ypres Salient]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].

The cemetery grounds were assigned to the [[United Kingdom]] in perpetuity by the [[Albert I of Belgium|King of Belgium]] in recognition of the sacrifices made by the [[British Empire]] in the defence and liberation of [[Belgium]] during the war.

==Foundation==

[[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] troops began using the site as a cemetery in March 1915.<ref name="cwgc">[http://www.cwgc.org/search/cemetery_details.aspx?cemetery=51402&mode=1 Commonwealth War Graves Commission entry], undated, accessed 17 February 2007</ref> The cemetery is named after a nearby farm.<ref name="fww">Duffy, Michael [http://www.firstworldwar.com/today/chesterfarmcemetery.htm firstworldwar.com], 1 September 2002, accessed 17 February 2007</ref>

Unusually, the dead are mostly grouped by [[battalion]],<ref name="wo1main">[http://www.wo1.be/ned/database/dbDetail.asp?subtypeID=19&typeid=6&ItemID=5695&lID=3 wo1.be], undated, accessed 17 February 2007</ref> departing from the usual Commission practice of there being little or no order other than date to the burials.

There are special markers for six soldiers (five [[United Kingdom|British]] and one [[Canada|Canadian]]) who are known or believed to be buried in the cemetery but whose actual plot was lost or destroyed.<ref name="wo1main" /> These stones usually have the [[Rudyard Kipling]]-derived footnote ''"Their glory shall not be blotted out"''.
