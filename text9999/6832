'''Noctilucent clouds''', also known as '''polar mesospheric clouds''', are  [[Cloud|cloud-like]] phenomena in the upper [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], visible in a deep [[twilight]]. They are made of crystals of [[ice|water ice]]. The name means roughly ''night shining'' in [[Latin]]. They are most commonly observed in the summer months at [[latitude]]s between 50<U+00B0> and 70<U+00B0> north and south of the [[equator]].

They are the highest [[cloud]]s in the [[Earth's atmosphere]], located in the [[mesosphere]] at altitudes of around {{convert|76|to|85|km|mi|sp=us|lk=on}}. They are normally too faint to be seen, and are visible only when illuminated by sunlight from below the horizon while the lower layers of the atmosphere are in the Earth's shadow. Noctilucent clouds are not fully understood and are a recently discovered [[meteorology|meteorological phenomenon]]; there is no evidence that they were observed before 1885. 

Noctilucent clouds can form only under very restrictive conditions; their occurrence can be used as a sensitive guide to changes in the upper atmosphere. Since their discovery the occurrence of noctilucent clouds has been increasing in frequency, brightness and extent. It is theorised that this increase is connected to [[climate change]].

==Formation==

Noctilucent clouds are composed of tiny crystals of [[ice|water ice]] 40 to 100 [[nanometer]]s in diameter<ref name=Phillips>{{cite web  | last = Phillips  | first = Tony|title = Strange Clouds at the Edge of Space|publisher = [[NASA]]|date = August 25, 2008|url = http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/25aug_nlc.htm }}</ref> and exist at a height of about {{convert|76|to|85|km|mi|sp=us|lk=on}},<ref name=Hsu>{{cite web|last=Hsu|first=Jeremy|title=Strange clouds spotted at the edge of Earth's atmosphere|date=[[2008-09-03]]|publisher=USAtoday|url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2008-09-02-strange-clouds-space_N.htm}}</ref> higher than any other clouds in Earth's atmosphere.<ref name=Times>{{cite news

The sources of both the dust and the water vapour in the upper atmosphere are not known with certainty. The dust is believed to come from [[meteor|micrometeors]], although [[volcano]]es and dust from the [[troposphere]] are also possibilities. The moisture could be lifted through gaps in the [[tropopause]], as well as forming from the reaction of [[methane]] with [[hydroxyl radical]]s in the [[stratosphere]].<ref name=Atoptics>[http://www.atoptics.co.uk/highsky/nlc2.htm About NLCs, Polar Mesospheric Clouds], from Atmospheric optics</ref> 

The exhaust from [[Space Shuttle]]s, which is almost entirely water vapour, has been found to generate individual clouds. About half of the vapor is released into the [[thermosphere]], usually at altitudes of {{convert|103|to|114|km|mi|sp=us}}.<ref>{{cite press release

This exhaust can be transported to the [[Arctic]] region in little over a day, although the exact mechanism of this very high-speed transport is unknown. As the water migrates northward, it falls from the thermosphere down into the colder mesosphere, which occupies the region of the atmosphere just below.<ref name=Goddard>{{cite web

[[Ultraviolet radiation]] from the Sun breaks water molecules apart, reducing the amount of water available to form noctilucent clouds. The radiation is known to vary cyclically with the [[solar cycle]] and satellites have been tracking the decrease in brightness of the clouds with the increase of ultraviolet radiation for the last two solar cycles. It has been found that changes in the clouds follow changes in the intensity of ultraviolet rays by about a year, but the reason for this long lag is not yet known.<ref name=Cole>{{cite web|last=Cole|first=Stephen|title=AIM at the Edge of Space|date=[[2007-03-14]]|publisher=[[NASA]]|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/aim/edge_of_space.html}}</ref>

== Discovery and investigation ==

Noctilucent clouds were first observed in 1885, two years after the volcanic eruption of [[Krakatoa]].<ref name = NYT/> It remains unclear whether their appearance had anything to do with the volcano, or whether their discovery was due to more people observing the spectacular sunsets caused by the volcanic debris in the atmosphere. Studies have shown that noctilucent clouds are not caused solely by volcanic activity, although dust and water vapour could be injected into the upper atmosphere by eruptions and contribute to their formation.<ref name = AAD2/> Scientists at the time assumed the clouds were another manifestation of volcanic ash but, after the ash had settled out of the atmosphere, the noctilucent clouds persisted.<ref name=Phillips2/> The theory that the clouds were composed of volcanic dust was finally disproved by Malzev in 1926.<ref>{{cite web|last = Bergman |first=Jennifer| title=History of Observation of Noctilucent Clouds|date=[[2004-08-17]]|url=http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/earth/Atmosphere/NLC_history.html|accessdate=2008-10-06}}</ref>

In the years following their discovery the clouds were studied extensively by [[Otto Jesse]] of [[Germany]], who was the first to photograph them, in 1887, and seems to have been the one to coin the term "noctilucent cloud"<ref>{{cite web

| accessdate = 2008-10-06}}</ref>, which means "night-shining cloud"<ref name=Phillips/>. His notes provide evidence that noctilucent clouds first appeared in 1885. He had been doing detailed observations of the unusual sunsets caused by the Krakatoa eruption the previous year and firmly believed that, if the clouds had been visible then, he would undoubtedly have noticed them.<ref>Schr<U+00F6>der (2001), p.2457</ref> Systematic photographic observations of the clouds were organized in 1887 by Jesse, [[Wilhelm Julius Foerster|Foerster]] and Dr. Stolze and, after that year, continuous observations were carried out at the [[Berlin Observatory]].<ref>Schr<U+00F6>der (2001), p.2459</ref> During this research the height of the clouds was first determined, via [[triangulation]].<ref>Schr<U+00F6>der (2001), p.2460</ref> The project was discontinued in 1896.

In the decades after Otto Jesse's death in 1901, there were few new insights into the nature noctilucent clouds. Wegener's conjecture that they were composed of water ice was later shown to be correct.<ref>{{cite web | author = Keesee, Bob | title = Noctilucent Clouds | url = http://www.albany.edu/faculty/rgk/atm101/nlc.htm | publisher = [[University of Albany]]| accessdate = 2008-10-19}}</ref> Study was limited to ground-based observations and scientists had very little knowledge of the mesosphere until the 1960s, when direct rocket measurements began. These showed for the first time that the occurrence of the clouds coincided with very low temperatures in the mesosphere.<ref>Schr<U+00F6>der (2001), p.2464</ref>

Noctilucent clouds were first detected from space by an instrument on the [[OGO]]-6  satellite in 1972. The OGO-6 observations of a bright scattering layer over the polar caps were identified as poleward extensions of these clouds.<ref>Gadsden (1995), p.18.</ref> A later satellite, the [[Solar Mesosphere Explorer]], mapped the distribution of the clouds between 1981 and 1986 with its ultraviolet spectrometer.<ref>Gadsden (1995), p.18.</ref> The first physical confirmation that water ice is indeed the primary component of noctilucent clouds came from the HALOE instrument on the [[UARS]] satellite in 2001.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hervig, Mark; Thompson, Robert E.; McHugh, Martin; Gordley, Larry L.; Russel, James M.; Summers, Michael E.|title=First Confirmation that Water Ice is the Primary Component of Polar Mesospheric Clouds|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|year=2001|month=March|volume=28|issue=6|pages=971&ndash;974|doi=10.1029/2000GL012104|bibcode=2001GeoRL..28..971H}}

On August 28, 2006, scientists with the [[Mars Express]] mission announced that they found clouds of [[carbon dioxide]] over [[Mars]] that extended up to 100 km above the surface of the planet. They are the highest clouds discovered over the surface of a planet. Like noctilucent clouds on Earth, they can only be observed when the Sun is below the horizon.<ref>{{cite web | author = SPACE.com staff| title = Mars Clouds Higher Than Any On Earth | url = http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060828_mars_clouds.html | publisher = SPACE.com | date = 2006-08-28 | accessdate = 2008-10-19}}</ref>

[[Image:Iss017e011632.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Noctilucent clouds photographed by the crew of the ISS.]]

Noctilucent clouds can be seen by observers at a [[latitude]] of 50 to 60 degrees.<ref>Gadsden (1995), p.8.</ref> They seldom occur at lower latitudes (although there have been sightings as far south as [[Utah]] and [[Italy]])<ref name=Atoptics2/> and, closer to the poles, it does not get dark enough for the clouds to become visible.<ref name = Giles>{{cite web

Southern hemisphere noctilucent clouds are fainter and occur less frequently; additionally the southern hemisphere has a lower population and less land area from which to make observations.<ref name=AAD1>{{cite web | author = A. Klekociuk, R. Morris, J.

The clouds can show a large variety of different patterns and forms. An identification scheme was developed by Fogle in 1970 that classified five different forms. These classifications have since been modified and subdivided.<ref>Gadsden (1995), pp.9-10.</ref>

They can be studied from the ground, from space, and directly by [[sounding rocket]]. Also, some also noctilucent clouds are made of smaller crystals, 30nm or less, which are invisible to observers on the ground because they do not scatter enough light.<ref name=Phillips/>

==Connection to climate change==

There is evidence that the relatively recent appearance of noctilucent clouds, and their gradual increase, may be linked to [[climate change]].<ref name="Thomas">{{cite journal | last =Thomas | first =GE | coauthors =Olivero J | title =Noctilucent clouds as possible indicators of global change in the mesosphere | journal =Advances in Space Research | volume =28 | pages =939<U+2013>946 | date =2001
}}</ref> Atmospheric scientist Gary Thomas of the [[University of Colorado]] has pointed out<ref name=Phillips/> that the first sightings coincide with the [[Industrial Revolution]] and they have become more widespread and frequent throughout the 20th century. The connection remains controversial however.<ref name=Phillips/>

Climate models predict that increased greenhouse gas emissions cause a cooling of the mesosphere, 
which would lead to more frequent and widespread occurrences of noctilucent clouds.<ref name=AAD1/> 
A competing theory is that larger methane emissions from intensive farming activities produce more water vapour in the upper atmosphere-<ref name=AAD2/> methane concentrations have more than doubled in the past 100 years.<ref name=Hsu/>

Tromp et al. suggest that a transition to a [[hydrogen economy]] could increase the number of noctilucent clouds through increased emissions of free hydrogen.<ref>{{cite journal  | author = Tracey K.
