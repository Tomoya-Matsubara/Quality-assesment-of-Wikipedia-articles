'''Waihi''' is a town in [[Hauraki District]] in the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]], especially notable for its history as a gold mine town. It had a population of 4,503 at the 2006 census.<ref>{{NZ Quickstats|3534400}}</ref>

The town is at the foot of the [[Coromandel Peninsula]], close to the western end of the [[Bay of Plenty]]. The nearby resort town of [[Waihi Beach]], ten kilometres to the east, is often regarded as the westernmost point of the Bay of Plenty region. To the west are the hills of the [[Kaimai Ranges]]. Road access from this direction is through the winding [[Karangahake Gorge]] road. Waihi has an unusually wet and damp [[microclimate]] for New Zealand's east coast with an average annual rainfall of 2147 mm.

==History==
=== Early times ===

;Mining
{{Main|Martha Mine}}

Waihi is located in the Coromandel district, which was one of the great gold mining districts of the world. The township grew around the mining operations since the discovery of gold in 1878 by prospectors John McCombie and Robert Lee. The samples of rock they had sent to be assayed were not considered worthwhile, so they left the area.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Their claim was taken over by William Nicholl in 1879. He marked out {{convert|5|acre|m2}}, calling his claim 'Martha' after a family member.<ref name="FEVER"/> Several smaller claims were later merged to form the Martha Company. By 1882 the first battery to break gold-bearing rock was in operation. The [[Martha Mine]] eventually grew into one of the world's most important gold and silver mines, after industrial [[cyanide]] processes made recovering gold from the low-grade ores easier. Waihi prospered with the mine, by 1908 being the fastest-growing town in the Auckland Province, three times the size of [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]].<ref name="FEVER">[http://www.waihi.org.nz/main.aspx?topicID=2&parent=14 Gold Fever] (from the 'History & Heritage' section of the 'Waihi.org' website)</ref>

Waihi was also a major centre of union unrest in New Zealand during the early years of the 20th century. The [[Waihi miners' strike|1912 miners' strike]] led to violence in an incident which still causes some resentment in the town.

By 1952, when the mighty Martha Mine closed, around 5.6 million ounces (174,160kg) of gold and 38.4 million ounces (1,193,180kg) of silver had been produced from 11,932,000 tonnes of ore.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Mining stopped in 1952 after a total of 160 km of tunnels had been driven into the quartz of Martha Hill,<ref name="To1990">''Engineering to 1990'' - [[Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand|IPENZ]], Engineering Publications Co Ltd, Page 15</ref> not because the Martha had run out of gold, but rather because of fixed gold prices, lack of manpower, and increasing costs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Mining in the [[Coromandel Peninsula]] had otherwise ceased by the 1980s.<ref name="MINE">[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10612000 Conservation land could be mined - Govt]</ref>

However, mining later resumed, with some protests against it during the 1987 consent process.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Plans to stop operations  in the 2000s were eventually shelved as well, and the Newmont Mining corporation is currently (2009) actively investing in extending the further economic life of the mine and the underground operations in nearby Favona. As of 2009, the mine comprises about 25-30% of the local economy.<ref>''Martha mine may test goodwill, says report'' - ''[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]'', Saturday 14 March 2009, Page C7</ref> 

;Railways

In November 1905, a [[branch line]] [[railway]] was opened to Waihi from [[Paeroa]]; this eventually evolved into the [[East Coast Main Trunk Railway]], which reached [[Taneatua]] in 1928. By the 1960s, traffic volumes for the port of [[Tauranga]] had outgrown the capacity of the circuitous line through Waihi and a deviation to the south was built. It opened in 1978, making the line through Waihi redundant, but the [[Goldfields Railway]] was established to save the six kilometres of railway between Waihi and [[Waikino]]. The railway continues to operate today and is a popular tourist attraction.

===Counterculture era===
[[Image:1979 Festival Aerial Image.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Nambassa]] festival in 1979.]]
In the 1970s Waihi saw a large influx of [[hippies]] in search of [[environmentally friendly]] [[alternative lifestyle]]s settle there and around the [[Waikino]] area. These young [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] proponents bought with them numerous [[cottage industries]] which helped supplement Waihi's economy. The [[Nambassa]] rock and alternative festivals were held around Waihi and [[Waikino]] between 1975 and 1982, increasing the population by around 10,000-75,000 for a few days each year and bringing revenue to the town. Temporary tent cities were established on the Northern end of Waihi on farms up Landlyst Rd at Golden Valley, to accommodate festival goers.

=== Recent history ===
In the late 1980s a new openpit started operations over the top of the old underground mine. This operation is nearing its completion, however recent plans to cutback the pit wall have postponed the promised lake and recreational area. A new underground mine called Favona is in operation near the processing plant to the east of Waihi. There is a minority that feel it will be impossible to create the lake while underground operations are occurring near the site.  

In the late 1990s several properties had to be condemned and roads permanently closed after the land under them subsided as a result of the collapse of old underground mine workings, with visible holes and cracks on the surface.  In December 2001, a home adjacent to Martha Pit collapsed into historical workings, 14 neighbouring homes were affected, some never able to return to get personal belongings.  Another 31 homes were also brought once more areas were identified via the report to be at either high, med or low risk of collapse into historical workings adjacent to the pit..Today the mine's [[smoko]] room sits near this site. Noise, dust, blasting vibrations continue to cause stress for some residents as operations to stabilise the pit continue because it was incorrectly constructed (and consequently peer reviewed)from the beginning. The iconic Pumphouse has just been moved to ensure its safety which also allows for the mine pit to be widened and more gold retrieved from the site the pumphouse was housed.  The ground adjacent to the new site of the pumphouse has slumped, we can only hope "old workings" are not getting ready to collapse there too.   

Mine management has received positive responses for its rigorous environmental effects control procedures and its commitment to the local community in terms of consultation and financial assistance. This has, amongst other things, led to the mine management company, Newmont-Waihi, receiving the 'Advanced Sustainable Business Award' from [[Environment Waikato]], the Regional Council of the area.<ref>''Getting it right for the Waihi community'' - ''Business North'', July 2007, Page 19</ref>  Despite all these attempts many of the mines closest neighbours do not qualify for compensation for the mines impact.

Mining remains the major employer in the area thanks to the company postponing the long promised mine closure and lake formation in 2007.  Newmont will  now stay until 2017 when consents expire, unless they have found more resource then they will apply to stay. 
Until the electrical appliance industry was [[Deregulation|deregulated]] in New Zealand in the 1980s, Waihi had a [[television]] assembly plant operated first by Akrad then by [[Philips]] which employed 400 locally and 1500 nation wide causing no adverse impacts on its neighbours .
