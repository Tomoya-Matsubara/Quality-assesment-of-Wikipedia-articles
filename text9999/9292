'''Greene and Greene''' was an [[architectural]] firm established by brothers  '''Charles Sumner Greene''' (1868<U+2013>1957) and '''Henry Mather Greene''' (1870<U+2013>1954), influential early 20th Century American [[architect]]s.  Active primarily in [[California]], their [[bungalow]] houses and larger-scale [[ultimate bungalow]]s are prime exemplars of the [[American Craftsman|American Arts and Crafts Movement]].

==Biography==
Charles and Henry Greene were born in Brighton, Ohio, now part of [[Cincinnati]], in 1868 and 1870, respectively. They grew up primarily in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and on their mother's family farm in [[West Virginia]] while their father attended medical school. 

As teenagers, the brothers studied at the Manual Training School of [[Washington University]] in St. Louis, where they studied metal- and wordworking and graduated in 1887-1888. Their father, a practicing homeopathic physician by this time, was very concerned with the need for sunlight and circulating fresh air; the importance of these elements was to become one of the signatures of the brothers' work.

Charles and Henry each received a "certificate for completion of partial course," a special two-year program at [[MIT]]'s School of [[Architecture]], in 1891. They studied classical building styles, intending at that time only to gain certification for apprenticeships with architecture and construction firms upon graduation.

After MIT in spring 1890, Charles apprenticed first with the firm of Andrews, Jaques and Rantoul; but after four and a half months, moved to the office of R. Clipston Sturgis. By March 1891, he had moved again to work with Herbert Langford Warren; and by the following November, he had changed again to the firm of Winslow and Wetherell. He would stay there until the two brothers departed to join their parents in [[Pasadena, California]]. Henry apprenticed first with the firm of Chamberlin & Austin and then briefly went to work with [[Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge]]. All of the firms the brothers worked for were located in [[Boston]], Mass.

In 1893 their parents requested that the sons move to Pasadena, where they had moved to a year before. The brothers agreed and, while traveling by train from Boston, they stopped at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago and saw a few examples of [[Japanese architecture]]. This experience made a lasting impression on both of them, according to a late-in-life interview with Henry. There was actually very little Japanese influence upon their work until after Charles visited the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis.

===Ultimate bungalows===
[[Image:GambleHouse-2005 edit1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Gamble House (Pasadena, California)|Gamble House]], [[Pasadena, California]], in 2005]]The Architectural firm of Greene and Greene was established in Pasadena in January 1894, eventually building toward the crescendo of their "[[ultimate bungalow]]s", such as the 1908 [[Gamble House (Pasadena, California)|Gamble House]] in Pasadena, generally considered one of the finest examples of residential architecture in the United States. 

Two other landmark ultimate bungalows were the [[Robert R. Blacker House]] in Pasadena and the [[Thorsen House]]. Such ultimate bungalows were completely custom affairs, where the vast majority of ingredients <U+2014> light fixtures, furniture, even woven [[textiles]] <U+2014> were created for specific spaces in the home.

In 1901 Charles Greene married Alice Gordon White, and they honeymooned in Europe and her native England. It was following this trip that the firm began developing the distinctive stylistic elements that finally came together as a cohesive whole in their grand works of 1907-09. The Greenes developed a personal idiom within the [[Arts and crafts]] aesthetic, receiving commissions to design furnishings for their houses. Charles' sketches for the 1903 Mary Darling house were published in England in ''Academy Architecture'' the same year, representing the first foreign publication of the firm's work.

In 1905 the Greenes began an association with Peter Hall as the primary contractor for their major commissions, and from 1907 with his brother John Hall, who ran a millwork shop producing their decorative arts and furniture designs.

The firm of Greene & Greene was officially dissolved in 1922 after Charles moved his family north to [[Carmel, California]]. Henry remained in Pasadena, doing architecture projects on his own.  The brothers remained lifelong friends until their deaths in the 1950s.

==A structural explosion==
{{Ref improve section|date=September 2010}}The structure of the Greene & Greene house is essential not only to the immense feeling of security that such an overly-supported structure brings, but also accentuates the importance of the Arts & Crafts fundamentals in the Greene & Greene style.  The visual importance of the aesthetic nature of the joints, pegs, and complex wood-work symbolizes the structure of the house, and coincides with the principles taught in the Manual Training School of their youth.  The structure of the house is externalized, or exploded, rather than hidden in decoration.  Each element of the structure asserts itself.  This extravagance of support takes its origins from the elaborate joinery and framing of traditional Japanese architecture.

==Obscurity and rediscovery==

The Greenes took on few commercial projects. Their attention to detail would not have been possible in a larger firm, or one that focused on commercial buildings as well as residential.  The Greenes repeatedly turned down offers to construct buildings in downtown Los Angeles.  The Greene brothers were masters in their area of domestic concentration for which, until the year of 1948, they received little acclaim. In 1948 they received citations from the Pasadena Chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]] and from the national body in 1952 for creating a <U+201C>new and native architecture.<U+201D> In 1960, they were among the pioneer modern architects included in the book ''Five California Architects'' by [[Esther McCoy]], where the chapter on the Greenes was written by Randall Makinson.

The Greene & Greene style's influence on California<U+2019>s architectural history is undeniable. Their style wedded practical comfort and fine art into a refined, crafted masterpiece in which every detail contributed to the overall subtlety of the work, essentially a masterpiece of design.
