'''King's Highway 417''', commonly referred to as '''Highway 417''' and the '''Queensway''' through Ottawa, is a [[400-series highway]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]]. It connects [[Montreal]] (via [[Quebec Autoroute 40|A40]]) with [[Ottawa]], and is the backbone of the transportation system in the [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]]. Within Ottawa, it forms part of the Queensway (along with [[Regional Road 174|Ottawa Road 174]] east to Trim Road) west to [[Ontario Highway 7|Highway 7]]. Highway&nbsp;417 extends from the [[Quebec]] border (near [[Hawkesbury, Ontario|Hawkesbury]]) to [[Arnprior, Ontario|Arnprior]], where it continues westward as [[Ontario Highway 17|Highway 17]]. Aside from the urban section through Ottawa, Highway&nbsp;417 passes through farmland that dominates much of the fertile [[Ottawa Valley]].

Within Ottawa, the Queensway was built as part of a [[Greber Plan|grand plan for the city]] between 1957 and 1966, and later reconstructed to its present form throughout the 1980s. The eastern section, from [[Gloucester, Ontario|Gloucester]] to the Quebec border, opened in 1975 in preparation for the [[1976 Montreal Olympics]]. Sections west of Ottawa have been under construction since the mid-1970s, with the latest section to Arnprior opening in 2005. As of 2012, the Arnprior Bypass is being [[twinning (roads)|twinned]] as far west as Campbell Drive and is scheduled for completion by the end of the year.

== Route description ==
Highway&nbsp;417 is a {{convert|181.4|km|abbr=on}} [[controlled-access highway]] that traverses the lower [[Ottawa Valley]] and upper [[St. Lawrence Valley]], bypassing the generally two-lane Highway&nbsp;17 and providing a high-speed connection between Montreal and Ottawa via A-40. The freeway has also gradually been extended northwest from Ottawa alongside the old highway to its current terminus in Arnprior. Highway&nbsp;417 currently has 42 interchanges from the Quebec border to Arnprior, with more planned as the highway is extended westward. Unlike other highways in Ontario and most of North America, exits are numbered from east to west.<ref name="2010 mapart" />

While a significant portion of Highway&nbsp;417 is a rural four lane freeway divided by a [[central reservation|grass median]], the section within urban Ottawa is a busy commuter route as wide as eight lanes. The portion of the route from the [[Ontario Highway 7|Highway&nbsp;7]] interchange east to ''the Split'' <U+2013> a large four-way interchange between Highway&nbsp;417, [[Ottawa Regional Road 174]] and the [[Aviation Parkway (Ottawa)|Aviation Parkway]] <U+2013> is known formally as the ''Queensway'', although no indication of this name appears on any signage.<ref>{{cite book

=== Quebec to Ottawa ===
[[File:Welcome to Ontario.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quebec Autoroute 40|Autoroute 40]] becomes Highway 417 at the Ontario border; both form part of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]].]]
Highway&nbsp;417 begins at the border between the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, east of which the four lane freeway continues as Autoroute&nbsp;40. The route proceeds west along the former [[right-of-way (transportation)|alignment]] of Highway&nbsp;17, which it has served to replace. It passes through a forested and agricultural landscape en route to Ottawa, serving the communities of [[Hawkesbury, Ontario|Hawkesbury]], [[Vankleek Hill]], [[Casselman, Ontario|Casselman]], [[Limoges, Ontario|Limoges]] and [[Vars, Ontario|Vars]]. After approximately {{convert|9|km|abbr=on}} the route curves southwest while ramps provide access from the westbound lanes to [[Prescott and Russell County Road 17]] and from County Road 17 to the eastbound lanes of Highway&nbsp;417. The route later meets the southern terminus of [[Ontario Highway 34|Highway&nbsp;34]] at Exit&nbsp;27. Continuing southwest, the route meanders along the boundary between [[The Nation]] and [[North Glengarry]], eventually encountering the northern terminus of [[Ontario Highway 138|Highway 138]]<U+2014>a highway built to connect Highway&nbsp;417 with [[Highway&nbsp;401]] and [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]]<ref>{{cite report

After crossing a [[Via Rail]] line, the route dips south of Casselman and curves to the west at Exit&nbsp;66 (County Road&nbsp;7). It roughly parallels the Via Rail line several kilometres north of the freeway, though significant deviations bypass the communities of [[Benoit, Ontario|Benoit]] and Limoges; the latter is served by Exit&nbsp;79 (County Road&nbsp;5).<ref name="2010 mapart" /> Near Limoges is the [[Larosse Forest]], a man-made forest planted between 1928 and 1980 over the Bourget Desert, itself created as the result of clear cutting in the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web

North of Ramsayville, the route jogs abruptly to the west as it crosses Greens Creek and enters the suburbs of Ottawa; an interchange with Innes Road divides the countryside to the south and east from the city to the north and west.<ref>{{cite web

The freeway merges with the Queensway at a large multi-level interchange known locally as the Split, curving to the west and into downtown Ottawa. The interchange also provides access to Aviation Parkway from westbound Highway&nbsp;417 and from the parkway to eastbound Highway&nbsp;417.<ref name="gmaps" />

=== Queensway ===
[[File:Highway 416 near Highway 417.jpg|thumb|left|Highway 417 facing east at ''the Split'']]
Within Ottawa, the Queensway extends from Orleans in the east and passes just south of downtown through central Ottawa to Kanata in the west. Two major interchanges anchor either end of this section: in the east, Highway&nbsp;417 diverges south towards Montreal at ''The Split'', while the Queensway continues east as [[Ottawa Regional Road 174|Regional Road 174]] and [[Aviation Parkway (Ottawa)|Aviation Parkway]] branches north; in the west, [[Ontario Highway 416|Highway&nbsp;416]] travels south to [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway&nbsp;401]]. The core section of the Queensway is eight lanes wide, four per carriageway.<ref name="central">{{Google maps

 | title      = Queensway through Ottawa

 | accessdate = July 1, 2012}}</ref>

The freeway is elevated on a [[berm]] along some central portions of the route, providing views of downtown and the [[Gatineau Hills]] to the north. This section was constructed along a former [[Canadian National Railway]] railbed.<ref name="greber review" /> The route bisects central Ottawa with downtown and the Parliament Buildings lay to the north of the highway and residential neighbourhoods including the Glebe to the south. Towards the Richmond Road interchange, the original western terminus of the Queensway, both sides of the freeway are lined by residential subdivisions.<ref name="central" />

Between [[Eagleson Road|Eagleson]]/[[March Road]] and [[Moodie Drive]] in the west and between [[Blair Road]] and [[Place d'Orl<U+00E9>ans]] Drive in the east, a bus-only shoulder is used by OCTranspo's [[Ottawa Transitway|Transitway]] rapid-transit network.<ref>{{cite web

At Exit&nbsp;145, the route encounters the eastern terminus of Highway&nbsp;7, which travels southwest to [[Peterborough]] and the GTA and provides an alternative route to Highway&nbsp;401 via Highway&nbsp;416. Highway&nbsp;417 makes a broad 90-degree curve to the north to meet with the midpoint of the Carp Bypass at the former [[Ontario Highway 44|Highway&nbsp;44]] (now Ottawa Regional Road&nbsp;49).<ref name="2010 mapart" />

The Carp Bypass was built in the mid-1960s as a bypass of the existing Highway&nbsp;17, which meandered through the communities of [[Carp, Ontario|Carp]], [[Kinburn, Ottawa, Ontario|Kinburn]] and [[Antrim, Ontario|Antrim]]; the former highway is now Donald B. Munro Drive, and lies to the east of Highway&nbsp;417.<ref name="2010 mapart" /> The bypass was built as a two lane road with full control of access, avoiding existing properties and easily facilitating the upgrade to a freeway. North of Antrim, Highway&nbsp;417 travels in a straight line parallel to old Highway&nbsp;17 as far as Arnprior, where it curves to bypass south of that town. The divided freeway ends immediately east of the Madawaska River, west of an interchange with Renfrew County Road&nbsp;29.<ref name="2010 mapart" /> Twinning is underway for several kilometres northeast of this point, but not yet open to traffic.<ref name="Arnprior" />

Construction of the Queensway was driven by the [[Greber Plan]], which was produced by [[Jacques Gr<U+00E9>ber]] under the direction of Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|William Mackenzie]] in the late 1940s. Although Gr<U+00E9>ber had been corresponding with King as early as 1936, [[World War II]] halted any plans from reaching fruition at that time. Following the war, Gr<U+00E9>ber was again contacted and his expertise requested. He arrived on October 2, 1945 and began working almost immediately.<ref>{{cite book

With the rail lines removed, construction of the new expressway got underway in 1957 when [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]] visited Ottawa to open the first session of the 23rd Parliament. On October&nbsp;15, the Queen detonated dynamite charges from the Hurdman Bridge, which now overlooks the highway as it crosses the Rideau River, and formally dedicated the new project as the Queensway. At the ceremony, premier [[Leslie Frost]] indicated that the entire project would cost C$31 million and emphasized the importance of the link to the Trans-Canada Highway.<ref>{{cite news

=== New freeway ===
Planning was underway on a new freeway, Highway&nbsp;417, that would run east of Ottawa from the Queensway, connecting with [[Quebec Autoroute 40|A-40]] to provide a high-speed route to Montreal. Highway&nbsp;17, closely following the shore of the Ottawa River as it meanders towards [[Pointe-Fortune, Ontario|Pointe-Fortune]], was dangerous, narrow, and accident prone, earning it the nickname of "the killer strip".<ref>{{cite news

Construction began in the west end of Ottawa in 1967. By 1970, a short extension to Moodie Drive was completed, including the realignment of that road for continuity north and south of Highway&nbsp;417.<ref>{{cite map

Construction halted at the eastern edge of Kanata for several years while a study was conducted into the merits of building the highway in a trench through the established city. During this time, construction began in 1974 on the future Queensway and Highway&nbsp;7 interchange. Work also began on the two lane connections to Highway&nbsp;7 as well as to the Highway&nbsp;17 and [[Ontario Highway 44|Highway&nbsp;44]] junction west of Carp at the same time.<ref>{{cite book

Upon the completion of the Ottawa<U+2013>Quebec section of freeway, the Queensway was designated as Highway&nbsp;417 west of The Split.<ref>{{cite book

With the completion of the Kanata study during early 1976, work began to build the route through the city-centre in a depressed-grade; as a result all the crossings though that section pass over the freeway. By early 1978, the western extension was opened to traffic, providing four lanes between Richmond Road and Highway&nbsp;7 /&nbsp;417. The two legs beyond the interchange were initially constructed as two-lane undivided roads, and remained as such for over a decade.<ref>{{cite book

Throughout the 1980s, work on Highway&nbsp;417 shifted from extensions to expansions. Within Ottawa, the initially four lane route, separated by a wide grass median, was expanded to eight lanes with paved shoulders and centre-mounted lighting beginning in 1982.<ref>{{cite book

To reduce weaving, the exit at Kent Street was removed during this work. Expansion of the two lane Highway&nbsp;17 west of the interchange with Highway&nbsp;7 got underway in 1991; this section was renumbered as Highway&nbsp;417 as construction progressed westward. The construction saw a second two lane roadway built parallel to the existing route to create a divided freeway, a process known as [[twinning (roads)|twinning]].<ref>{{cite book
