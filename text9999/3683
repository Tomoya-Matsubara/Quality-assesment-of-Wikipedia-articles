'''Douglas Noel Adams''' (11 March 1952 &ndash; 11 May 2001) was an [[England|English]] [[author]], [[dramatist]] and [[musician]]. He is best known as the author of the ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series. ''Hitchhiker's'' began on radio, and developed into a "trilogy" of five books (which sold more than fifteen million copies during his lifetime) as well as a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|television series]], a comic book series, a radio play, a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|computer game]], and a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|feature film]] that was completed after Adams' death. The series has also been adapted for live theatre using various scripts; the earliest such productions used material newly written by Adams.<ref>{{cite book | author=Simpson, M. J. | title=The Pocket Essential Hitchhiker's Guide | pages = 52 | edition =Second edition | publisher=Pocket Essentials | year=2005 | isbn=1-904048-46-3}}</ref> He was known to some fans as ''Bop Ad'' (after his illegible signature), or by his initials "DNA"; Adams was proud of the coincidence that he was born in Cambridge the year before the elucidation of the structure of [[DNA]] in the same city.<ref>[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.douglas-adams/browse_thread/thread/2b45dff04b442b68/0fe671d25b3b00ff?lnk=st&q=%22Bop+Ad%22&rnum=6#0fe671d25b3b00ff FAQ posted to alt.fan.douglas-adams]</ref>

In addition to ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', Douglas Adams wrote or co-wrote three stories of the science fiction television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and served as Script Editor during the seventeenth season. His other written works include the [[Dirk Gently]] novels, and he co-wrote two [[The Meaning of Liff|Liff]] books and ''[[Last Chance to See]]'', itself based on a radio series. Adams also originated the idea for the computer game ''[[Starship Titanic]]'', which was produced by a company that Adams co-founded, and adapted into a novel by [[Terry Jones]]. A posthumous collection of essays and other material, including an incomplete novel, was published as ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'' in 2002. His Science Fiction-Humour books are similar to the style of [[Jasper Fforde]], [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Rob Grant]].  

His fans and friends also knew Adams as an environmental activist, a confirmed [[atheist]], and a lover of fast cars, cameras, the [[Macintosh]] computer, and other "techno gizmos". The biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] dedicated his book ''[[The God Delusion]]'' to Douglas Adams and in it described how Adams came to understand [[evolution]]. Douglas was a keen [[technologist]], writing about such topics as e-mail and [[Usenet]] before they became widely known. Toward the end of his life he was a sought-after lecturer on topics including technology and the environment.

==Early life==
<!-- Please leave this section heading as is, for the chronology of events. Adams' own family (wife and daughter) are discussed later. -->

Douglas Adams was born to Janet Adams ([[n<U+00E9>e]] Donovan, and now known as Janet Thrift) and Christopher Douglas Adams in [[Cambridge]], England. His parents had one other child together, Susan, who was born in March 1955. His parents separated and divorced in 1957, and Douglas, Susan, and Janet moved in with Janet's parents, the Donovans, in [[Brentwood, Essex]]. Douglas' grandmother kept her house as an official [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCA]] refuge for hurt animals, which "exacerbated young Douglas' [[hayfever]] and [[asthma]]".<ref>{{cite book | authorlink = Nick Webb (author) | last = Webb | first = Nick | title=Wish You Were Here: The Official Biography of Douglas Adams | edition =First U.S. hardcover edition | publisher=Ballantine Books | year=2005 | pages = 32 | isbn=0-345-47650-6 }}</ref>

Christopher Adams remarried in July 1960, to Mary Judith Stewart (born Judith Robertson). From this marriage, Douglas Adams had a half-sister, Heather. Janet remarried in 1964, to a veterinarian, Ron Thrift, providing two more half-siblings to Douglas: Jane and James Thrift.

==Education and early works==
[[Image:Douglas Adams Sign from HH cover.jpg|thumb|Douglas Adams was known to some fans as "Bop Ad", because of his illegible signature.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ray |first=Mohit K. |authorlink= |title=Atlantic Companion to Literature in English |publisher=Atlantic Publishers and Distributors |date=2007 |pages=4 |isbn=8126908327}}</ref>]]
Adams attended Primrose Hill Primary School in Brentwood. He took the exams and interview for [[Brentwood School (England)|Brentwood School]] at six, and attended the [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]] from 1959 to 1964, then the main school until 1970. He was in the top stream, and specialised in the arts in the sixth form, after which he stayed an extra term in a seventh form class, customary in the school for those preparing for [[Oxbridge]] entrance exams.

While at prep school, his English teacher, Frank Halford, reportedly awarded Adams the only ten out of ten of his teaching career for creative writing.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3790659 BBC - h2g2 - Douglas Adams<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Adams remembered this for the rest of his life, especially when facing [[writer's block]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas | title=The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time | edition=US mass market paperback edition | publisher=Ballantine | year=2005 | pages=xix | isbn=0-345-45529-0 | nopp=true}}</ref> Some of Adams' earliest writing was published at the school, such as a report on the school's photography club in ''The Brentwoodian'' (in 1962) or spoof reviews in the school magazine ''Broadsheet'' (edited by [[Paul Neil Milne Johnstone]]). He also designed the cover of one issue of the ''Broadsheet''.

Adams also had a letter and short story published nationally in the UK in ''[[Eagle (comic)|The Eagle]]'', the boys' comic, in 1965. He met [[Griff Rhys Jones]], who was in the year below, at school, and was in the same class as [[Stuckist]] artist [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]]; all three appeared together in a production of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar in 1968. Adams was six feet tall (1.83 m) by age 12 and he stopped growing at 6'5" (1.96 m). Later, he made jokes about his towering stature: "[T]he form-master wouldn't say 'Meet under the clock tower,' or 'Meet under the war memorial,' but 'Meet under Adams.'"<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas | title=The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time | edition=First UK hardcover edition | publisher=Macmillan | year=2002 | pages=7 | isbn=0-333-76657-1}}</ref>

On the strength of a bravura essay on religious poetry that discussed the [[Beatles]] along with [[William Blake]], he was awarded a place at [[St John's College, Cambridge]] to read English, entering in 1971.<ref>Webb, Nick, "Adams, Douglas No<U+00EB>l (1952 <U+2013> 2001)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', online edn, Oxford University Press, January 2005 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/75853, accessed 25 October 2005]</ref> Adams attempted to get into the [[Footlights]] Dramatic Club, with which several other names in [[British comedy]] had been affiliated. He was turned down, and started to write and perform in revues with Will Adams (no relation) and Martin Smith, forming a group called "Adams-Smith-Adams." Later, in another attempt to join Footlights, Adams was encouraged by [[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]] and found himself working with Rhys Jones, among others. In 1974, Adams graduated with a B.A. in [[English literature]].

Some of his early work appeared on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] (television) in 1974, in an edited version of the ''Footlights Revue'' from Cambridge, that year. A version of the revue performed live in London's [[West End of London|West End]] led to Adams being discovered by [[Monty Python]]'s [[Graham Chapman]]. The two formed a brief writing partnership, and Adams earned a writing credit in one episode (episode 45: "Party Political Broadcast on Behalf of the Liberal Party") of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' for a sketch called "[[Patient Abuse]]". In the sketch, a man who had been stabbed by a nurse arrives at his doctor's office bleeding from the stomach. The doctor asks him to fill out numerous senseless forms before he will administer treatment (a joke later incorporated into the [[Races and Species in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Vogons|Vogons']] obsession with paperwork). Adams also contributed to a sketch on the album for ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''.

[[Image:DNA in Monty Python.jpg|thumb|Douglas Adams in his first ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus|Monty Python]]'' appearance, in full surgeon's garb in episode [[Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything|42]].]]

Douglas had two brief appearances in the fourth series of ''Monty Python's Flying Circus''. At the beginning of episode 42, "The Light Entertainment War", Adams is in a surgeon's mask (as Dr Emile Koning, according to on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while [[Michael Palin]] narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another but never actually gets started. At the beginning of episode 44, "Mr Neutron", Adams is dressed in a "[[Pepperpot (Monty Python)|pepperpot]]" outfit and loads a missile on to a cart driven by [[Terry Jones]], who is calling for scrap metal ("Any old iron..."). The two episodes were broadcast in November 1974. Adams and Chapman also attempted non-Python projects, including ''[[Out of the Trees]]''.

Some of Adams' early radio work included sketches for ''[[The Burkiss Way]]'' in 1977 and ''[[The News Huddlines]]''. He also wrote, again with Graham Chapman, the 20 February 1977 episode of ''Doctor on the Go'', a sequel to the ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'' television comedy series.

As Adams had difficulty selling jokes and stories, he took a series of odd jobs. A biography from an early edition of one of the ''HHGG'' novels says:
<blockquote>
After graduation he spent several years contributing material to radio and television shows as well as writing, performing, and sometimes directing [[revue|stage revues]] in [[London]], Cambridge and at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]]. He has also worked at various times as a hospital porter, barn builder, chicken shed cleaner, bodyguard, [[radio producer]] and [[script editor]] of ''[[Doctor Who]]''.
</blockquote>
Adams worked as a bodyguard in the mid-1970s. He was employed by a [[Qatar]] Arab family which had made its fortune in oil.<ref>"Adams, Douglas No<U+00EB>l." Britannica Book of the Year, 2002 from Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online School Edition. [http://school.eb.com/eb/article-9383539, accessed 13 November 2005].</ref> He had anecdotes about the job: one story related that the family once ordered one of everything from a hotel's menu, tried all the dishes, and sent out for hamburgers. Another story had to do with a prostitute sent to the floor Adams was guarding one evening. They acknowledged each other as she entered, and an hour later, when she left, she is said to have remarked, "At least you can read while you're on the job."<ref>Webb, page 93.</ref>

In 1979, Adams and [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] wrote scripts for two half-hour episodes of ''[[Doctor Snuggles]]'': "The Remarkable Fidgety River" and "The Great Disappearing Mystery" (episodes seven and twelve). John Lloyd was also co-author of two episodes from the original "Hitchhiker" radio series (Fit the Fifth and Fit the Sixth (also known as Episodes Five and Six, see explanation below)), as well as ''[[The Meaning of Liff]]'' and ''[[The Deeper Meaning of Liff]]''. Lloyd and Adams also collaborated on an SF movie comedy project based on ''[[The Guinness Book of World Records]]'', which would have starred [[John Cleese]] as the UN Secretary General, and had a race of aliens beating humans in athletic competitions, but the humans winning in all of the "absurd" record categories. This latter project never proceeded past a treatment.

After the first radio series of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'' became successful, Adams was made a BBC radio producer, working on ''[[Week Ending]]'' and a [[pantomime]] called ''[[Black Cinderella Two Goes East]]''. He left the position after six months to become the script editor for ''[[Doctor Who]]''.

==''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''==
{{main|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy}}
''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' was a concept for a science-fiction comedy radio series pitched by Adams and radio producer [[Simon Brett]] to [[BBC Radio 4]] in 1977. Adams came up with an outline for a pilot episode, as well as a few other stories (reprinted in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s book ''[[Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion]]'') that could potentially be used in the series.

According to Adams, the idea for the title ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' occurred to him while he lay drunk in a field in [[Innsbruck, Austria]] (though he joked that the [[BBC]] would instead claim it was Spain "probably because it's easier to spell"<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas| editor= Geoffrey Perkins (ed.), Additional Material by M. J. Simpson|title=[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Original Radio Scripts]] | pages = 10 | edition =25th Anniversary Edition | publisher=Pan Books | year=2003 | isbn=0-330-41957-9}} [http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/metaguide/beginning.shtml One of the webpages] about ''Hitchhiker's'' on bbc.co.uk states "The BBC used to say this happened in Spain, but we know how to spell Innsbruck now."</ref>), gazing at the stars. He had been wandering the countryside while carrying a book called the ''[[Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe]]'' when he ran into a town where, as he humorously describes, everyone was either "deaf" and "dumb" or only spoke languages he could not understand. After wandering around and drinking for a while, he went to sleep in the middle of a field and was inspired by his inability to communicate with the townspeople. He later said that due to his constantly retelling this story of inspiration, he no longer had any memory of the moment of inspiration itself, and only remembered his retellings of that moment. A postscript to M. J. Simpson's biography of Adams, ''[[Hitchhiker: A Biography of Douglas Adams]]'', provides evidence that the story was in fact a fabrication and that Adams had conceived the idea some time after his trip around Europe.

Despite the original outline, Adams was said to make up the stories as he wrote. He turned to [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] for help with the final two episodes of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#The Primary Phase|the first series]]. Lloyd contributed bits from an unpublished science fiction book of his own, called ''GiGax''.<ref>Webb, page 120.</ref> However, very little of Lloyd's material survived in later adaptations of ''Hitchhiker's'', such as the novels and the TV series. The TV series itself was based on the first six radio episodes, but sections contributed by Lloyd were largely re-written.

[[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast the first radio series weekly in the UK in March and April 1978. Following the success of the first series, another episode was recorded and broadcast, which was commonly known as the Christmas Episode. [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#The Secondary Phase|A second series]] of five episodes was broadcast one per night, during the week of 21 January - 25 January 1980.

While working on the radio series (and with simultaneous projects such as ''[[The Pirate Planet]]'') Adams developed problems keeping to writing deadlines that only got worse as he published novels. Adams was never a prolific writer and usually had to be forced by others to do any writing. This included being locked in a hotel suite with his editor for three weeks to ensure that ''[[So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish]]'' was completed.<ref>[http://www.bookslut.com/nonfiction/2004_05_002057.php May 2004 review of] ''[[Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion|Don't Panic]]'' by [[Neil Gaiman]].</ref> He was quoted as saying, "I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by."<ref>{{cite book | author=Simpson, M. J. | title=[[Hitchhiker: A Biography of Douglas Adams]] | pages = 236 | edition =First U.S. hardcover edition | publisher=Justin, Charles and Co. | year=2003 | isbn=1-932112-17-0}}</ref> Despite the difficulty with deadlines, Adams eventually authored five novels in the series, published in 1979, 1980, 1982, 1984 and 1992.

The books formed the basis for other adaptations, such as three-part comic book adaptations for each of the first three books, an interactive text-adventure [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|computer game]], and a photo-illustrated edition, published in 1994. This latter edition featured a [[42 Puzzle]] designed by Adams, which was later incorporated into paperback covers of the first four "Hitchhiker's" novels (the paperback for the fifth re-used the artwork from the hardcover edition).<ref>[http://www.iblist.com/series.php?id=2 Internet Book List] page, with links to all five novels, and reproductions of the 1990s paperback covers that included the [[42 Puzzle]].</ref>

In 1980, Adams also began attempts to turn the first ''Hitchhiker's'' novel into a movie, making several trips to [[Los Angeles, California]], and working with a number of Hollywood studios and potential producers. The next year, 1981, the radio series became the basis for a BBC television mini-series [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081874/ "The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy"] broadcast in six parts. When he died in 2001 in California, he had been trying again to get the movie project started with Disney, which had bought the rights in 1998. The screenplay finally got a posthumous re-write by [[Karey Kirkpatrick]], was green-lit in September 2003, and [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|the resulting movie]] was released in 2005.

Radio producer [[Dirk Maggs]] had consulted with Adams, first in 1993, and later in 1997 and 2000 about creating a third radio series, based on the third novel in the ''Hitchhiker's'' series.<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas. | editor = [[Dirk Maggs]], dramatisations and editor. | title=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Radio Scripts: The Tertiary, Quandary and Quintessential Phases | publisher=Pan Books | year=2005|isbn=0-330-43510-8 |pages=xiv | nopp=true}}</ref> They also vaguely discussed the possibilities of radio adaptations of the final two novels in the five-book "trilogy." As with the movie, this project was only realised after Adams' death. The third series, ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Tertiary Phase|The Tertiary Phase]]'', was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] in September 2004 and was subsequently released on audio CD. With the aid of a recording of his reading of ''Life, the Universe and Everything'' and editing, Douglas Adams himself can be heard playing the part of Agrajag posthumously. ''So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish'' and ''Mostly Harmless'' made up the fourth and fifth radio series, respectively (on radio they were titled ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quandary Phase|The Quandary Phase]]'' and ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quintessential Phase|The Quintessential Phase]]'') and these were broadcast in May and June of 2005, and also subsequently released on Audio CD. The last episode in the last series (with a new, "more upbeat" ending) concluded with, "The very final episode of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' by Douglas Adams is affectionately dedicated to its author."<ref>Ibid. Page 356</ref>

More recently, the film makers at [[Smoov Filmz]] adapted the anecdote that [[Arthur Dent]] relates about biscuits in ''[[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish]]'' into a short film called "Cookies."<ref>[http://www.smoovfilmz.com/ Smoov Filmz] homepage. "Cookies" is featured under "Filmz and Projects."</ref> Adams also discussed the real-life episode that inspired the anecdote in a 2001 speech, reprinted in his posthumous collection ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]''. He also told the story on the radio programme ''It Makes Me Laugh'' on 19 July 1981.

==''Dirk Gently'' series==
In between Adams' first trip to Madagascar with [[Mark Carwardine]] in 1985, and their series of travels that formed the basis for the radio series and non-fiction book ''[[Last Chance to See]]'', Adams wrote two other novels with a new cast of characters. ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'' was first published in 1987, and was described by its author as "a kind of ghost-horror-detective-time-travel-romantic-comedy-epic, mainly concerned with mud, music and quantum mechanics."<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Neil Gaiman|Gaiman, Neil]] | title=Don't Panic: Douglas Adams & The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy | edition=Second U.S. edition | publisher=Titan Books | year=2003 | pages=169 | isbn=1-84023-742-2}}</ref> It received many rave reviews from American newspapers upon its publication in the USA. Adams borrowed a few ideas from two ''[[Doctor Who]]'' stories he had worked on: ''[[City of Death]]'' and ''[[Shada]]''.

A sequel novel, ''[[The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul]]'' was published a year later. This was an entirely original work, Adams' first since ''So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish.'' Reviewers, however, were not as generous with praise for the second volume as they had been for the first. After the obligatory book tours, Adams was off on his round-the-world excursion which supplied him with the material for ''Last Chance to See''.

==''Doctor Who''==
{{main|Doctor Who}}
Adams sent the script for the ''HHGG'' pilot radio programme to the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' production office in 1978, and was commissioned to write ''[[The Pirate Planet]]'' (see below). He had also previously attempted to submit a potential movie script, called "Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen," which later became his novel ''Life, the Universe and Everything'' (which in turn became the third ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' radio series). Adams then went on to serve as script editor on the show for its seventeenth season in 1979. Altogether, he wrote three [[List of Doctor Who serials|''Doctor Who'' serials]] starring [[Tom Baker]] as the Doctor:
* ''The Pirate Planet'' (the second serial in the "[[The Key to Time|Key To Time]]" arc, in [[List of Doctor Who serials#Season 16 (1978-79)|Season 16]])
* ''[[City of Death]]'' (with producer [[Graham Williams]], from an original storyline by writer [[David Fisher (writer)|David Fisher]]. It was transmitted under the pseudonym "[[David Agnew]]")
* ''[[Shada]]'' (only partially filmed and not broadcast due to industrial disputes)

The episodes authored by Adams are some of the few that have not been novelised as Adams would not allow anyone else to write them, and asked for a higher price than the publishers were willing to pay.<ref>[http://www.skepticfiles.org/en001/drwhogde.htm A 1990s Doctor Who FAQ]</ref>

Adams was also known to allow in-jokes from ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'' to appear in the ''Doctor Who'' stories he wrote and other stories on which he served as Script Editor. Subsequent writers have also inserted ''Hitchhiker's'' references, even [[42 (Doctor Who)|as recently as 2007]]. Conversely, at least one reference to ''Doctor Who'' was worked into a ''Hitchhiker's'' novel. In ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'', two characters travel in time and land on the pitch at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]]. The reaction of the radio commentators to their sudden appearance is very similar to the reactions of commentators in a scene in the eighth episode of the 1965 <U+2013> 66 story ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]'', which has [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor's]] [[TARDIS]] [[Materialization (science fiction)|materialise]] on the pitch at Lord's.

Elements of ''Shada'' and ''City of Death'' were reused in Adams' later novel ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'', in particular the character of [[Professor Chronotis]], and Dirk Gently himself clearly fills much the same plot role as the Doctor (though the character is very different). [[Big Finish Productions]] eventually remade ''Shada'' as an audio play starring [[Paul McGann]] as the Doctor. Accompanied by partially animated illustrations, it was [[Doctor Who spin-offs#Webcasts|webcast]] on the [[bbc.co.uk|BBC]] website in 2003, and subsequently released as a two-CD set later that year. An omnibus edition of this version was broadcast on the digital radio station [[BBC7]] on 10 December 2005.

Adams is credited with introducing a fan and later friend of his, the zoologist [[Richard Dawkins]], to Dawkins' future wife, [[Lalla Ward]], who had played the part of [[Romana]] in Doctor Who. Dawkins confirmed this in his published eulogy of Adams.<ref>[http://www.edge.org/documents/adams_index.html Edge: LAMENT FOR DOUGLAS By Richard Dawkins<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

When he was at school, he wrote and performed a play called ''Doctor Which''.<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas | title=The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time | edition=First UK hardcover edition | publisher=Macmillan | year=2002 | pages=xviii | isbn=0-333-76657-1 | nopp=true}}</ref>

==Music==
Adams played the [[guitar]] left-handed and had a collection of twenty-four left-handed guitars when he died in 2001 (having received his first guitar in 1964). He also studied [[piano]] in the 1960s with the same teacher as [[Paul Wickens]], the pianist who later played in [[Paul McCartney]]'s band (and composed the music for the 2004 <U+2013> 2005 editions of the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' radio series).<ref>Webb, page 49.</ref> [[The Beatles]], [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Procol Harum]] all had great influence on Adams' work.

===Pink Floyd===
Adams included a direct reference to [[Pink Floyd]] in the original radio version of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', in which he describes the main characters surveying the landscape of an alien planet while Marvin, their android companion, hums Pink Floyd's "[[Shine on You Crazy Diamond]]". This was cut out of the CD version.

Adams also compared the various noises that the [[kakapo]] makes to "Pink Floyd studio out-takes" in his nonfiction book on endangered species, ''[[Last Chance to See]]''.

Adams' official biography shares its name with the song "[[Wish You Were Here (1975 song)|Wish You Were Here]]" by [[Pink Floyd]]. Adams was friends with Pink Floyd guitarist [[David Gilmour]] and, on the occasion of Adams' 42nd birthday (the number 42 having special significance, being [[Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything|The Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything]] and also Adams' age when his daughter Polly was born), he was invited to make a guest appearance at Pink Floyd's 28 October 1994 concert at Earls Court in [[London]], playing [[rhythm guitar]] on the songs "[[Brain Damage (song)|Brain Damage]]" and "[[Eclipse (song)|Eclipse]]". Video is not available of this event, but a link to audio is present below. Adams chose the name for Pink Floyd's 1994 album, ''[[The Division Bell]]'', by picking the words from the lyrics to one of its tracks, namely "High Hopes". Gilmour also performed at Adams' memorial service following his death in 2001.

Pink Floyd and their lavish stage shows were also the inspiration for the Adams-created fictional [[rock music|rock]] band "[[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Hotblack Desiato|Disaster Area]]", described in the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' as "not only the loudest rock band in the galaxy, but in fact the loudest noise of any kind". One element of Disaster Area's stage show was to send a space ship hurtling into a sun, probably inspired by the plane that would crash into the stage during some of Pink Floyd's live shows, usually at the end of "[[On the Run (Pink Floyd song)|On the Run]]". The 1968 Pink Floyd song "[[Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun]]" may also have influenced the ideas behind Disaster Area.

===Procol Harum===
Douglas Adams was a friend of [[Gary Brooker]], the lead singer, pianist and songwriter of the [[progressive rock]] band [[Procol Harum]]. Adams is known to have invited Brooker to one of the many parties that Adams held at his house. On one such occasion Gary Brooker performed the full (4 verse) version of his hit song "[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]". Brooker also performed at Adams' memorial service.

Adams also appeared on stage with Brooker to perform "In Held Twas in I" at Redhill when the band's lyricist [[Keith Reid]] was not available. On several other occasions he had been known to introduce Procol Harum at their gigs.

Adams also let it be known that while writing he would listen to music, and this would occasionally influence his work. On one occasion the title track from the Procol Harum album ''[[Grand Hotel (album)|Grand Hotel]]'' was playing when...
{{quote|Suddenly in the middle of the song there was this huge orchestral climax that came out of nowhere and didn't seem to be about anything. I kept wondering what was this huge thing happening in the background? And I eventually thought ... it sounds as if there ought to be some sort of floorshow going on. Something huge and extraordinary, like, well, like the end of the universe. And so that was where the idea for The Restaurant at the End of the Universe came from.|Douglas Adams|Procol Harum at The Barbican<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.procolharum.com/dadams.htm |title=Text of one of Douglas Adams' introductions of Procol Harum in concert |dateformat=dmy | accessdate=21 August 2006|last=Adams |first=Douglas |date=8 February 1996}}</ref>}}

===Other musical links===
Adams made a number of references to music and musicians who had influenced his work through his books. In the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' series, examples include one of the two mice, in ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', suggesting that as they have not found the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, they should instead make it up, proposing to use the question "How many roads must a man walk down?" This is a line from [[Bob Dylan]]'s song, "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]". Prior to this scene, in the same novel, the ship's computer onboard the [[Heart of Gold (spaceship)|Heart of Gold]], unable to assist or prevent the ship's impending destruction with two nuclear missiles closing in on it, sings "[[You'll Never Walk Alone (song)|You'll Never Walk Alone]]" in the background, a [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] hit from the musical ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'' which had been an early 1960s rock hit in the UK and then was adopted as a crowd chant by many [[football (soccer)|football]] fans, in particular [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] supporters, a recording of which ended up on Pink Floyd's album ''[[Meddle]]'', interspersed throughout the track, "[[Fearless (song)|Fearless]]".

''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]'', the second novel in the series, is dedicated to the 1980 Paul Simon soundtrack album, ''[[One-Trick Pony (album)|One-Trick Pony]]''. Adams says he played it "incessantly" while writing the book. In one scene in the fourth novel, ''[[So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish]]'', Arthur Dent listens to a [[Dire Straits]] LP and Adams goes on to pay tribute to their lead guitarist, [[Mark Knopfler]]. Adams later revealed that the particular song to which he refers in the book &mdash; although never by name &mdash; is "[[Tunnel of Love (song)|Tunnel of Love]]", from the ''[[Making Movies]]'' album. And in the final novel, ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'', [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] is discovered playing in a diner attended by [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]] and [[Arthur Dent]], where he is simply known as "The King".

Besides modern rock music, Douglas Adams was a great admirer of the work of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], which provides a minor plot element in ''Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency''. Adams was also good friends with [[The Monkees]]' [[Michael Nesmith]]. In the early 1990s, one of the aborted attempts to have ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' adapted into a movie would have had Nesmith as its producer.

Adams was also a fan of [[The Beatles]]. He makes a reference to [[Paul McCartney]] in ''Life, the Universe and Everything'' and quotes lyrics and titles from songs by The Beatles in ''Mostly Harmless'' and ''Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency''.
In 'Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency' this exchange takes place:
:"[[Yes It Is|Yes, it is]]," said the Professor. "[[Wait (song)|Wait]]--[[Let It Be (song)|let it be]]. [[It Won't Be Long|It won't be long]]."
:Richard stared in disbelief. "You say there's a horse in your bathroom, and all you can do is stand there naming Beatles songs?"
:"Well, the bathroom window's open. I expect [[She Came In Through the Bathroom Window|she came in through that]]."
:"You're doing it deliberately, aren't you?"

Adams also does this several times in ''The Salmon of Doubt''. In Chapter 3 there is a conversation between Kate and Dirk, which includes the following exchange:

:"So?"
:"I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair."

Taken together, these two lines form a quotation from "[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)|Norwegian Wood]]" on the ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' album.

==Computer games and projects==
Douglas Adams created an [[interactive fiction]] version of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|HHGG]]'' together with [[Steve Meretzky]] from [[Infocom]] in 1984. In 1986 he participated in a week-long brainstorming session with the [[Lucasfilm Games]] team for the game ''[[Labyrinth (video game)|Labyrinth]]''. Later he was also involved in creating ''[[Bureaucracy (computer game)|Bureaucracy]]'' (also by Infocom, but not based on any book). Adams was also responsible for the computer game ''[[Starship Titanic]]'', which was published in 1998 by [[Simon and Schuster]]. Terry Jones wrote the accompanying book, entitled ''Douglas Adams<U+2019>s Starship Titanic'', since Adams was too busy with the computer game to do both. In April 1999, Adams initiated the [[H2G2|h2g2]] [[collaborative writing]] project, an experimental attempt at making ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' a reality, and at harnessing the collective brainpower of the [[internet]] community.

In 1990, Adams wrote and presented a [[television documentary]] programme ''[[Hyperland]]''<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0188677/ Internet Movie Database's page for ''Hyperland''].</ref> which featured [[Tom Baker]] as a "software agent" (similar to the "Assistants" used in several versions of [[Microsoft Office]], derived from their failed [[Microsoft bob|"Bob" program]]), and interviews with [[Ted Nelson]], which was essentially about the use of [[hypertext]]. Although Adams did not ''invent'' hypertext, he was an [[early adopter]] and advocate of it. This was the same year that [[Tim Berners-Lee]] used the idea of hypertext in his [[HTML]].

==Personal beliefs==
===Atheism and view on religion===
Adams described himself as a "radical [[atheist]]", though he used the term for emphasis so that he would not be asked if he meant [[agnostic]]. He stated in an interview with [[American Atheists]]<ref>[http://www.americanatheist.org/win98-99/T2/silverman.html David Silverman's interview with Douglas Adams] which first appeared in the American Atheists' Winter 1998 <U+2013> 1999 newsletter.</ref> that this made things easier, but most importantly it conveyed the fact that he really meant it, had thought about it, and that it was an opinion he held seriously. He stated that his views had nothing to do with belief, and stated that "I am ''convinced'' there is no [[God]]", and devoted himself to secular causes such as [[environmentalism]]. Despite this, he did state in the same interview that he was "fascinated by religion." [...] "I love to keep poking and prodding at it. I<U+2019>ve thought about it so much over the years that that fascination is bound to spill over into my writing." His fascination he ascribed to the fact that so many "otherwise rational... intelligent people... nevertheless take [the existence of God] seriously".

The evolutionary biologist and atheist [[Richard Dawkins]] in ''[[The God Delusion]]'' uses Adams' influence throughout to exemplify arguments for non-belief; Dawkins jokingly states that Adams is "possibly [my] only convert" to atheism. In the same paragraph Dawkins expresses missing his close friend.<ref>[http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/roundupstory/0,,1939704,00.html Observer, ''The God Delusion'', 5 November 2006]</ref> The book is dedicated to Adams' memory, quoting him, "Isn<U+2019>t it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too?".

====Sentient puddle====
One analogy Adams put forward about religion was that of the "sentient puddle." This analogy is intended to refute the suggestion that the existence of God and his love for humankind would be proven because the world is perfectly designed for our needs. He compared such thinkers to an intelligent puddle of water. Adams said the puddle is certain that the hole in the ground it occupies must have been designed specifically for it because it fits so well. The puddle exists under the sun until it has entirely evaporated.<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas | others=Edited by Peter Guzzardi | title=The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time | edition =First UK hardcover edition | publisher=Macmillan | year=2002 | pages = 131<U+2013>2|isbn=0-333-76657-1 }} The full text is reproduced in the essay "Is there an Artificial God?"</ref><ref>"[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,490295,00.html Lament for Douglas Adams]" by [[Richard Dawkins]], which refers to the same allegory. First published on 14 May 2001, accessed on 13 July 2006.</ref>

===Environmental activism===
Adams was also an [[environmental activist]] who campaigned on behalf of a number of [[endangered species]]. This activism included the production of the non-fiction radio series ''[[Last Chance to See]]'', in which he and [[natural history|naturalist]] [[Mark Carwardine]] visited rare species such as the [[Kakapo]] and [[Chinese River Dolphin|Baiji]], and the publication of a tie-in book of the same name. In 1992, this was made into a CD-ROM combination of [[audio book]], [[e-book]] and picture slide show.

Adams and Mark Carwardine contributed the 'Meeting a Gorilla' passage from ''[[Last Chance to See]]'' to the book ''[[Great Ape Project|The Great Ape Project]]''.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Paola Cavalieri|Cavalieri, Paola]] and [[Peter Singer]], editors | title=The Great Ape Project: Equality Beyond Humanity | edition=U.S. Paperback | publisher=St. Martin's Griffin | year=1994 | pages=19 <U+2013> 23|isbn=0-312-11818-X}}</ref> This book, edited by [[Paola Cavalieri]] and [[Peter Singer]] launched a wider-scale project in 1993, which calls for the extension of moral equality to include all great apes, human or nonhuman.

In 1994 he participated in a climb of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] while wearing a rhino suit for the British charity organisation ''[[Save the Rhino]]''. Many different people participated in the same climb and took turns wearing the rhino suit; Adams wore the suit while traveling to the mountain before the climb proper began. About <U+00A3>100,000 were raised through that event, benefiting schools in [[Kenya]] and a [[Black Rhinoceros]] preservation programme in [[Tanzania]]. Adams was also an active supporter of the ''[[Dian Fossey]] Gorilla Fund''. Since 2003, ''Save the Rhino'' has held an annual Douglas Adams Memorial Lecture around the time of his birthday to raise money for environmental campaigns.<ref>[http://www.savetherhino.org/etargetsrinm/site/808/default.aspx Details of Fifth Douglas Adams Memorial Lecture].</ref> The lectures in the series are:
* 2003 [[Richard Dawkins]] <U+2014> ''Queerer than we can suppose: the strangeness of science''
* 2004 [[Robert Swan]] <U+2014> ''Mission Antarctica''
* 2005 [[Mark Carwardine]] <U+2014> ''Last Chance to See... Just a bit more''
* 2006 [[Robert Winston]] <U+2014> ''Is the Human an Endangered Species?''
* 2007 [[Richard Leakey]] <U+2014> ''Wildlife Management in East Africa <U+2013> Is there a future?''
* 2008 [[Steven Pinker]] <U+2014> ''The Stuff of Thought, Language as a Window into Human Nature''
* 2009 [[Benedict Allen]] <U+2014> ''Unbreakable''

===Technology===
Adams was a serious fan of technology. Though he did not buy his first [[word processor]] until 1982, he had considered one as early as 1979. He was quoted as saying that until 1982, he had difficulties with "the impenetrable barrier of jargon. Words were flying backwards and forwards without concepts riding on their backs." In 1982, his first purchase was a 'Nexus'. In 1983, when he and Jane Belson went out to Los Angeles, he bought a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Rainbow 100|Rainbow]]. Upon their return to England, Adams bought an [[Apricot Computers|Apricot]], then a [[BBC Micro]] and a [[Tandy]] 1000.<ref>Simpson, ''[[Hitchhiker: A Biography of Douglas Adams|Hitchhiker]]'', pages 184 <U+2013> 5.</ref> In ''[[Last Chance to See]]'' Adams mentions his [[Cambridge Z88]], which he had taken to [[Zaire]] on a quest to find the Northern White Rhinoceros.<ref>{{cite book|author=Adams, Douglas and [[Mark Carwardine]] | title=Last Chance to See | edition=First U.S. Hardcover | publisher=Harmony Books | year=1991 | pages=59 | isbn=0-517-58215-5}}</ref>

Adams' posthumously published work, ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'', features multiple articles written by Douglas on the subject of technology, including reprints of articles that originally ran in ''[[MacUser]]'' magazine, and in ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'' newspaper. In these, Adams claims that one of the first computers he ever saw was a [[Commodore PET]], and that his love affair with the [[Apple Macintosh]] first began after seeing one at Infocom's headquarters in Massachusetts in 1983 (though that was actually very likely an [[Apple Lisa]]).<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas | title=The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time | edition=First UK hardcover edition | publisher=Macmillan | year=2002 | pages=90<U+2013>1 | isbn=0-333-76657-1}}</ref>

Adams was a Macintosh user from the time they first came out in 1984 until his death in 2001. He was the first person to buy a Mac in the UK (the second being [[Stephen Fry]] - though some accounts differ on this, saying Fry bought the first). Adams was also an [[AppleMasters|"Apple Master"]], one of several celebrities whom Apple made into spokespeople for its products (other Apple Masters included [[John Cleese]] and [[Gregory Hines]]). Adams' contributions included a rock video that he created using the first version of [[iMovie]] with footage featuring his daughter Polly. The video can still be seen on Adams' [[.Mac]] homepage. Adams even installed and started using the first release of [[Mac OS X]] in the weeks leading up to his death. His very last post to his own forum was in praise of Mac OS X and the possibilities of its [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] programming framework.<ref>[http://www.douglasadams.com/cgi-bin/mboard/info/dnathread.cgi?2922,1 Adams' final post on his forums at douglasadams.com]</ref> Adams can also be seen in the ''[[Omnibus (TV series)|Omnibus]]'' tribute included with the Region One/NTSC DVD release of the TV adaptation of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'' using Mac OS X on his [[PowerBook]] G3.

Adams used e-mail extensively from the technology's infancy, adopting a very early version of e-mail to correspond with [[Steve Meretzky]] during the pair's collaboration on Infocom's version of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. While living in New Mexico in 1993 he set up another e-mail address and began posting to his own [[USENET]] newsgroup, alt.fan.douglas-adams, and occasionally, when his computer was acting up, to the comp.sys.mac hierarchy.<ref>[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.douglas-adams alt.fan.douglas-adams] access through [[Google]]'s newsgroup reader.</ref> Many of his posts are now archived through [[Google]]. Challenges to the authenticity of his messages later led Adams to set up a message forum on his own website to avoid the issue.

==Personal life==
In the early 1980s, Adams had an affair with novelist [[Sally Emerson]], who was separated from her husband at that time. Adams later dedicated his book ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'' to Ms. Emerson. In 1981 Emerson returned to her husband, [[Peter Stothard]], a contemporary of Adams at [[Brentwood School (England)|Brentwood School]], and later editor of [[The Times]]. Adams was soon introduced by friends to Jane Belson, with whom he later became romantically involved. Belson was the "lady barrister" mentioned in the jacket-flap biography printed in his books during the mid-1980s ("He [Adams] lives in Islington with a lady barrister and an Apple Macintosh"). The two lived in Los Angeles together during 1983 while Adams worked on an early screenplay adaptation of ''Hitchhiker's''. When the deal fell through, they moved to London, and after several separations ("He is currently not certain where he lives, or with whom") and an aborted engagement, they were married on 25 November 1991. Adams and Belson had one daughter together, Polly Jane Rocket Adams, born on 22 June 1994, in the year that Adams turned [[42 (number)#In pop culture|42]]. In 1999, the family moved from London to [[Santa Barbara, California]], where they lived until Adams' death. Following his funeral, Jane Belson and Polly Adams returned to London<ref>Webb, Chapter 10.</ref>

==Death==
[[Image:Douglas Adams' gravestone.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Douglas Adams' gravestone, [[Highgate Cemetery]], North London]]
Adams died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 49 on 11 May 2001, during the rest period of his regular workout at a private [[gym]] in [[Montecito, California]]. He had unknowingly suffered a gradual narrowing of the coronary arteries, which led at that moment to a [[myocardial infarction]] and a fatal [[cardiac arrhythmia]]. Adams had been due to deliver the commencement address at [[Harvey Mudd College]] on 13 May.<ref>[http://chronicle.com/free/speakers/index.php3?handler=search&Last_Name=&Institution=&State=&year=&order=name&page=2 List of] collegiate commencement speakers in the ''Chronicle of Higher Education''</ref> His funeral was held on 16 May 2001 in Santa Barbara, California. Several friends and people he had worked with were in attendance. His ashes were placed in [[Highgate Cemetery]] in north [[London]] in June 2002.<ref>Simpson, ''[[Hitchhiker: A Biography of Douglas Adams
|Hitchhiker]]'', pages 337 <U+2013> 8</ref>

A memorial service was held on 17 September 2001 at [[St. Martin-in-the-Fields Church]], [[Trafalgar Square]], London. This became the first church service of any kind broadcast live on the web by the BBC.<ref>Gaiman, 204</ref> Video clips of the service are still available on the BBC's website for download.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/celebration/ Douglas Adams'] Service of Celebration clips on the BBC website</ref>

In May 2002, ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'' was published, containing many [[short story|short stories]], [[essay]]s, and letters, as well as [[eulogy|eulogies]] from [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Stephen Fry]] (in the UK edition), [[Christopher Cerf]] (in the U.S. edition), and [[Terry Jones]] (in the U.S. paperback edition). It also includes eleven chapters of his long-awaited but unfinished novel, ''The Salmon of Doubt'', which was likely to become a new ''[[Dirk Gently]]'' novel.

Other events after Adams' death included the completion of ''[[Shada]]'', radio dramatisations of the final three books in the ''Hitchhiker's'' series, and the completion of the film adaptation of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. An 18-part radio series based on the [[Dirk Gently]] novels was announced in 2007, with transmission scheduled for October of that year.<ref>[http://www.dirkmaggs.dswilliams.co.uk/Dirk%20Maggs%20News%20%20new%20projects.htm Dirk Maggs] News and New Projects page</ref>

==Biographies==
His [[official biography]], ''Wish You Were Here'', by [[Nick Webb (author)|Nick Webb]], was published on 6 October 2003 (ISBN 0-7553-1155-8).<ref>[http://www.douglasadams.com/news/#20030703-0-n.dna Press release announcing Nick Webb's biography of Adams] from 2 July 2003.</ref>

Another biography is ''[[Hitchhiker: A Biography of Douglas Adams]]'' (2003) by M. J. Simpson, with a [[foreword]] in the UK edition by [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] (ISBN 0-340-82488-3), and was revised and updated in paperback in February 2004 (ISBN 0-340-82489-1). The American hardback edition contains a foreword by [[Neil Gaiman]] (ISBN 1-932112-17-0), and its April 2005 paperback equivalent (ISBN 1-932112-35-9) has an extra chapter about the movie.

Upon the mutual discovery that Webb and Simpson were both working on new posthumous biographies, the two authors agreed that the former would focus on Adams' life and personality, and the latter on his work.

In 1992, ITV's ''[[The South Bank Show]]'' produced a documentary about Douglas Adams which featured Dirk Gently and characters from Hitchhikers and contributions from Stephen Fry, Richard Dawkins and John Lloyd.

The BBC produced a tribute as part of their TV series ''Omnibus''. It was first broadcast on BBC 2 on 4 August 2001, presented by [[Kirsty Wark]]. The programme included interviews with [[Stephen Fry]], [[Clive Anderson]], [[Terry Jones]], [[Griff Rhys Jones]], [[Richard Dawkins]] and John Lloyd, among others. A copy is included with the Region One DVD release of the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' TV series.

A movie documentary, ''Life, The Universe and Douglas Adams'', was released in 2002, directed and produced by Rick Mueller and Joel Greengrass. Archive footage of Adams is generously included, as well as interviews with Adams' friends, colleagues and family. This documentary was narrated by [[Neil Gaiman]] and is available on VHS tape.<ref>[http://www.douglasadams.com/news/#20020415-0-n.dna Press release announcing the] ''Life, the Universe, and Douglas Adams'' documentary video from 15 April 2002.</ref>

Earlier biographies include:
* ''[[Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion]]'' (1988, 1993, 2002), [[Neil Gaiman]] ''et al.'' Reissued October 2003 (ISBN 1-84023-742-2) with new chapters by M. J. Simpson and [[David K. Dickson]].
* M. J. Simpson's book ''The Pocket Essential Hitchhiker's Guide'' was first published in April 2001 in the UK (ISBN 1-903047-40-4), and revised and reprinted after the death of Douglas Adams in October 2001. A third revision, (though titled the "Second, Revised Edition") was published in April 2005 in the UK, with new material (ISBN 1-904048-46-3).

A DVD release of each of the three 2004 <U+2013> 2005 series, featuring mixes in 5.1 surround sound, are also planned for release in 2006, starting in October, per Dirk Maggs. However, as of December 2006, only the Tertiary Phase has been released on DVD. While the first disc is not a [[DVD-Audio]], as was originally announced, it still marks the first release of any radio series in a 5.1 mix on DVD by BBC Audio. The six-episode [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|TV adaptation]] is also available from the BBC (or its distributors, e.g. Warner Home Video in the USA and Canada) on VHS and DVD.
