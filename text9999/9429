'''Robert James Ritchie''' (born January 17, 1971), known by his stage name '''Kid Rock''', is an American singer-songwriter and [[rapper]] with five [[Grammy Award]] nominations. Kid Rock is known for music that incorporates elements of [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[rap metal]], [[blues-rock]], [[hard rock]], [[southern rock]], [[funk]] and [[country music]].

Kid Rock released several studio albums that mostly went unnoticed before his 1998 record ''[[Devil Without a Cause]]'', released with [[Atlantic Records]], sold 11 million albums behind the hits, "[[Bawitdaba]]","[[Cowboy (song)|Cowboy]]," and "[[Only God Knows Why]]". In 2000, he released ''[[The History of Rock]]'' which was a compilation of remixed and remastered versions of songs from his previous albums as well as the hit single, "[[American Bad Ass]]". In 2001, he released the follow up, ''[[Cocky (album)|Cocky]]''. After a slow start, his country-flavored hit "[[Picture (song)|Picture]]" with [[Sheryl Crow]] resurrected the album and it went gold as a single and pushed the album's sales to more than 5 million. It was followed by 2003's [[Kid Rock (album)|self-titled release]], which failed to chart a major hit. In 2006 he released ''[[Live Trucker]]'' , a live album. In 2007 Kid Rock released ''[[Rock N Roll Jesus]]'', which produced a hit in "[[All Summer Long (Kid Rock song)|All Summer Long]]." It was his first worldwide smash hit, charting #1 in eight countries across Europe and Australia.<ref name="sales">{{cite web |title=Kid Rock Celebrates 2 Million Album Sold!|work=Vivid Seats |url=http://www.kidrock.com/news/2008/08/28/kid-rock-celebrates-2-million-album-sold/|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref><ref name="Sales">{{cite news |last=Youngs |first=Ian |title=Kid Rock boycotts iTunes over pay |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC, Inc. |date=2008-06-18 |accessdate=2008-07-22}}</ref> ''Rock N Roll Jesus'' would go on to sell 5 million albums worldwide including being certified triple platinum in the US. 

He has sold 22 million albums to date in the United States, which currently ranks him as the 99th best selling music artist of all time in the U.S.

==Musical career==
{{Wikify|date=April 2009}}
===Early years===

Ritchie was born in [[Romeo, Michigan]]. At age eleven he joined a [[breakdance]] crew (referred to as b-boy), called the Furious Funkers. They would dance anywhere they could for money. He saved up his money to buy a cheap belt-driven [[Phonograph|turntable]], and he taught himself how to work the tables. In high school, Ritchie [[DJ]]ed at parties for beer. He eventually joined Bo Wisdom of Groove Time Productions, in [[Mt. Clemens, Michigan]] to perform basement parties for thirty dollars a night. It was then that he was given his stage name; club goers dubbed him "Kid Rock" after they had enjoyed watching "that white kid that can rock." 
Rock started [[rapping]] and joined a local [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group, The Beast Crew. They were composed of The Blackman, Champtown, KDC, Crisp and Doc Rounce Cee. Rock became friends with producer [[D-Nice]] of the legendary hip-hop group [[Boogie Down Productions]]. When Rock opened for BDP one night, D-Nice invited an [[A&R]] representative from [[Jive Records]] to see him perform. This meeting led to a demo deal, which developed into a full record contract. 

Against his parents' wishes, Rock signed the deal at the age of seventeen. Despite his new record deal, he had a falling out with The Beast Crew when he signed over fellow member Champtown (the two have become friends again since). They left his vocals on the tracks of their debut underground album "Chapter 1: He Don't Want Us No More," against his wishes. Rock later became part of the Straight From The Underground Tour, where he found himself alongside several heavyweights of rap including [[Ice Cube]], [[Too Short]], D-Nice, Mac Dre, and [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]].

===Independent days (1991&ndash;1997)===
In late 1991 he was picked up by an independent record label called Continuum Records, which released his second album ''[[The Polyfuze Method]]'' the following year. He moved to Brooklyn to work on the album. It was more rock oriented with Rock teaching himself how to play several different instruments including guitar, drums, keyboard and organ. While the album saw some local college radio success at [[Central Michigan University]] with the tracks "Back From The Dead" and "Balls In Your Mouth", the lead single, "U Don't Know Me", which failed to chart, and the music video received little airplay on any major music video channels. Kid Rock re-released "Back From The Dead" as a single to mainstream radio, but that too failed as a single. The album has sold around 100,000 copies. 

He released an [[Extended play|EP]] called ''[[Fire It Up (EP)|Fire It Up]]'' later in 1993.  The album was hard rock oriented, but he couldn't get rock radio to pick up on any of the singles, including "[[I Am the Bullgod]]", which would be a hit five years later. He was told that there was too much rapping in the songs. Continuum didn't see a future with Rock after this and released him from his contract in 1994. 

He moved back to Detroit where his on-again/off-again relationship with Kelly South resulted in the birth of his son, Robert James Ritchie, Jr. Kid Rock has since acquired custody of his son.  He started his own label, Top Dog Records, and released monthly demo tapes dubbed ''The Bootleg Series'', which featured demos of him and other up-and-coming rappers and garage rock bands in the Detroit area.  Around the same time, Kid Rock formed his back-up band [[Twisted Brown Trucker]], later recruiting [[Joe C.]], who he met at a 1994 concert, as part of the group. In 1995, Rock took a job as a janitor at Whiterooms Studios in order to pay studio fees. When he wasn't working, Kid Rock recorded the material that would eventually make up his fourth album, ''[[Early Morning Stoned Pimp]]''. During the recording process he met piano player Jimmie Bones, who was working with Robert Bradley in the adjacent room at White Room Studios. Bones decided to join Kid Rock's band soon after. The album was released January 9, 1996. A loan from his father aided the release. Kid Rock sold 60,000 copies out of the trunk of his car, including after his concerts. With EMSP local success he would re-release The Polyfuze Method as The Polyfuze Method Revisted in 1997 with "I Am The Bullgod", "Rollin On The Island" and "Rain Check" as additional tracks in March 1997.

While Kid Rock was now popular in Michigan and controlling his own label, he felt he needed to get attention from a major label. He was unaware that in December 1996, Lava/Atlantic Records A&R man Andy Karp traveled to Cleveland to see Rock perform at a small club called The Grog Shop. This was key, because on March 30, 1997, Rock performed a special showcase concert to attract major label attention. While many of the major labels were invited, the only attendees were Karp and Lava President Jason Flom (Lava/Atlantic Records), who had seen him in Cleveland. Following the performance, record executives said they loved him but expressed doubts about the strength of his material. Kid Rock returned to the studio and cut a six song demo tape. The first two songs on the tape were "Somebody's Gotta Feel This" and "I Got One For Ya". After hearing the two songs, [[Jason Flom]] supported Karp in signing Kid Rock to a record deal for $100,000, without even hearing the rest of the material.<ref name="Lava Record Deal">{{cite web |title=Interview&nbsp;<U+2014> Andy Karp, Vice President of A&R at Lava/Atlantic in New York |work=AtlanticRecordsContact.com |url=http://www.atlanticrecordscontact.com/ |accessdate=2008-07-22}}</ref>

===''Devil Without a Cause'' (1997&ndash;2000)===
In 1997, Kid Rock added drummer/vocalist [[Stefanie Eulinberg]] to his band, joining [[Kenny Olson]], [[Jason Krause]], Jimmie Bones, [[Uncle Kracker]], Misty Love, Shirley Hayden and [[Joe C.]]. On August 18, 1998, Atlantic released ''[[Devil Without a Cause]]'' behind the single "Welcome 2 The Party."  Kid Rock went on the [[Warped Tour|Vans Warped Tour]] to support the album, performing one of his first New York City shows at Luna Lounge on the Lower East Side during the CMJ convention.

Audiences ignored "Welcome 2 The Party" and ''Devil'' sat on the shelves collecting dust for eight months.  While sales nationwide lagged, his performance on the 1998 Warped Tour in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] stimulated regional interest in [[Massachusetts]] and [[New England]].  This led to substantial airplay in the summer and fall of 1998 on rock staples in Massachusetts [[WZLX]] and [[WAAF (FM)|WAAF]] for the single "I Am The Bullgod." In December 1998, while dj'ing at a club he met and became friends with MTV host [[Carson Daly]], he got an offer to perform on ''MTV Fashionably Loud'' in Miami, giving the nation its first real look at Kid Rock. From there, MTV took him under their wing as he performed on MTV's ''Wanna B A VJ'' doing "My Name Is Rock" and was the DJ for ''TRL'' on the Spring Break Special as well as a judge on ''Say What Karaoke''. This sparked him to gold status by April 1999.<ref name="RIAA Certifications">{{cite web| title=RIAA Certifications for albums by Kid Rock: Gold and Platinum | publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |work= RIAA.com| url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Kid%20Rock%20&format=ALBUM&go=Search&perPage=50 |accessdate=2008-07-22}}</ref>

In May 1999, he released the song "[[Bawitdaba]]" to radio outlets, and proceeded to blow up overnight. By June, the album had gone platinum.<ref name="RIAA Certifications" /> Kid Rock went on the Limptropolis Tour with fellow rap-rockers [[Limp Bizkit]] and [[Staind]] in the same month, his first major tour. By the time he made his career defining performance at [[Woodstock 1999]] on July 27, 1999, he was double platinum.<ref name="RIAA Certifications" /> The following single "[[Cowboy (Kid Rock song)|Cowboy]]" was an even bigger hit. It was a unique mix of southern rock, country and rap that found its way into the Top 40. Kid Rock helped create one of the most memorable moments in MTV history with his 1999 Video Music Awards medley with [[Run-D.M.C.]] and [[Aerosmith]] who rejoined to perform the seminal rap-rock version of "[[Walk This Way]]," the same song that revived Aerosmith's career in the 1980s. Rock's next single, the rock ballad "[[Only God Knows Why]]," would be the biggest hit off the album charting at No 19 on the Billboard Hot 100. By the time the final single "[[Wasting Time (Kid Rock Song)|Wasting Time]]" was released the album had sold 7 million albums, ''Devil Without A Cause'' was certified 11 times platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on April 17, 2003.<ref name="RIAA Certifications" />. 

He was nominated as Best New Artist at the 2000 Grammy Awards, losing to [[Christina Aguilera]]. He was nominated for "Bawitdaba" for Best Hard Rock Performance, losing to Metallica's "Whiskey in the Jar."

===''The History of Rock'' (2000&ndash;2001)===
After reacquiring the rights to his early material in 2000, Rock released ''[[History of Rock|The History of Rock]]'', a collection of remixed and re-recorded songs from The Polyfuze Method and Early Mornin Stoned Pimp. The one of two new tracks, "American Bad Ass" was released as a single. It sampled the [[Metallica]] track "[[Sad But True]]".

On May 27 Kid Rock would perform on ''Saturday Night Live''. He first performed "American Bad Ass". The second song was an acoustic version of "Only God Knows Why" that featured Phish's Trey Anastasio. Kid Rock would join Phish later in the year in Las Vegas, Nevada, for a set of cover songs.

"American Bad Ass" was used as [[professional wrestler|pro wrestler]] [[The Undertaker]]'s entrance song in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] for a year. He performed the song in Vancouver Canada on Monday Night Raw on May 29, 2000. During the show Joe C helped Too Cool win the tag team titles from Edge and Christian who had mocked him for being a midget. Edge and Christian got their revenge by stuffing him in a trash can and slamming him into the wall afterwards. The following night Lars Ulrich and Kirk Hammett of Metallica joined Kid Rock to do "American Bad Ass" on ''The Tonight Show with Jay Leno''.

From June 30 to August 22, 2000, Rock joined the [[Summer Sanitarium Tour]] with Metallica, [[Korn]], [[Powerman 5000]], and [[System of a Down]]. Kid Rock filled in for [[James Hetfield]] of Metallica, singing vocals on the songs "Enter Sandman", "Sad But True", and "Nothing Else Matters" and the turntables for "Fuel", for three shows after Hetfield injured his spine riding a jet ski on [[Lake Lanier]] the day before the July 7 Atlanta concert.

On November 16, 2000 Joseph "Joe C" Callejua would pass away in his sleep from [[Coeliac disease]] in Taylor, MI. The disease stunted his growth and forced him to take 60 pills a day. Joe C's final song was "Cool Daddy Cool" for the ''Osmosis Jones'' soundtrack. The band made a cameo in the movie as the band playing in the club scene. Kid Rock was referred to as Kidney Rock to go along with the cartoon aspect of being a cell in the body of Frank played by Bill Murray.

In early 2001, Rock inducted Aerosmith into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and performed "[[Sweet Emotion]]" at the induction ceremony. The same year, Rock landed his first acting role in the [[David Spade]] [[white trash]] comedy ''[[Joe Dirt]]''. His character was Robbie a redneck bully to Joe Dirt who was chasing after Joe's unaware love interest Brandy.

"American Bad Ass" was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 2001s Grammy Awards. Losing out to Rage Against The Machine's "Guerilla Radio". The History of Rock would go on to be certified double platinum.

===''Cocky'' (2001&ndash;2002)===
[[Image:Pamela Anderson and Kid Rock.jpg|thumb|[[Pamela Anderson]] and Kid Rock in 2003]] In 2001 Kid Rock began dating [[Playboy Playmate]] and actress [[Pamela Anderson]], after the two met at a [[VH1]] tribute to [[Aretha Franklin]]. By April 2002, he and Anderson were engaged, but the engagement was later called off.<ref name="marriage">{{cite news |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,1219944,00.html |title=Pamela Anderson, Kid Rock Tie the Knot |last=Rubin |first=Courtney |coauthors=Dana Kennedy and Nancy Wilson |work=People |work=Time|date=2006-07-31 |accessdate=2008-07-22}}</ref>

In November, Kid Rock released ''[[Cocky (album)|Cocky]]'', which was marketed as the official follow up to ''Devil Without a Cause''. With the era of rap metal on the decline, Kid Rock included several southern rock and country ballads on the album. The first single, "[[Forever (Kid Rock song)|Forever]]", featured his standard brash rap-rock sound, but lacked the selling power of "Devil Without A Cause". By the time the songs "[[Lonely Road of Faith]]"and "[[You Never Met a Motherfucker Quite Like Me]]" were released as singles the album struggled to reach platinum a year later.
   
However, the release of "[[Picture (song)|Picture]]", a country-influenced duet with [[Sheryl Crow]], introduced Kid Rock to a wider audience. "Picture" was ultimately the most successful single on the album, and was eventually certified [[Gold album|gold]], with album sales reaching 5 million.<ref name="RIAA Certifications" />  Interestingly, neither his record company nor Sheryl Crow's wanted anything to do with "Picture" as a single. [[Allison Moorer]] remade the song for the single version after Kid Rock released the song against his label's wishes. Once it began to climb the country charts, Sheryl Crow's label caved and the original version was released.<ref name="picture song">{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1459755/20030129/kid_rock.jhtml |title=Kid Rock's Dead-In-The-Water Cocky Comes Back To Life |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |work=MTV |publisher=MTV Networks |date=2003-01-30 |accessdate=2008-07-22}}</ref> The song would chart at No 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No 17 on Country radio. The song remains his most successful pop song in the US to date.

On December 14, 2001, [[Country Music Television|CMT]] aired an episode of ''[[Crossroads (CMT TV series)|Crossroads]]'' featuring Rock with [[Hank Williams, Jr.]] The episode drew 2.1 million viewers, a record on CMT.<ref name="crossroads">{{cite news |title=Kid Rock revives the basics of rock ... but he's still got some rap in his repertoire |last=Finn |first=Timothy |work= The Kansas City Star |publisher=McClatchy Company |pages=F7 |date=2008-02-14 |url=http://news.google.com/archivesearch/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1-0&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kansascity.com%2F781%2Fstory%2F488087.html&ei=-F-GSLDpMa3E6gG08MnkBw&usg=AFQjCNH-ZyR19RG8YgA1qdzRicGaaD5Zeg}}</ref>. He would perform for troops in January 2002 on an MTV USO Special at Germany's [[Ramstein Air Base]] along with [[Ja Rule]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]].

At the end of 2002, [[Uncle Kracker]] left the band to pursue a solo career and Detroit underground rapper [[Paradime]] replaced him. Kid Rock made his second movie, ''[[Biker Boyz]]'', with [[Laurence Fishburne]].

===A new direction and move towards southern rock (2003&ndash;2005)===
In 2003, Kid Rock returned with an [[Kid Rock (album)|eponymous album]], almost stripping away the accustomed rap metal sound that he had created, opting for southern rock and several country ballads in the wake of "Picture"'s success. The album's lead single was a cover of [[Bad Company]]'s "[[Feel Like Makin' Love (Bad Company song)|Feel Like Makin' Love]]". A media blitz accompanied the single capped off by the VH-1 special called ''A Kid Rock Christmas'', which aired on December 14, 2003. He would release "Cold and Empty", "Jackson, Mississippi" and "I Am" to minor success on radio. The [[David Allan Coe]] penned "Single Father", became his second charting country song, although like the other singles it was minor hit at #50.<ref name="RIAA Certifications" />. Kid Rock would be his lowest selling mainstream studio album of his career with 1.4 million copies sold.

Kid Rock was involved in the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|halftime show controversy]] at [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] in Houston, Texas on February 1, 2004.  He was criticized by war veterans for his choice of wearing the American flag as a [[poncho]].

The following month, Kid inducted [[Bob Seger]] into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. In September 2005, Kid Rock filled in for [[Johnny Van Zant]], the lead singer of [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] on the band's hit "[[Sweet Home Alabama (song)|Sweet Home Alabama]]" at the [[Hurricane Katrina]] benefit concert.<ref name=bnet>{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20050909/ai_n15371925 |title=Many concerts to benefit Hurricane Katrina victims |work=Deseret News (Salt Lake City) |last=Iwasaki |first=Scott |date=2005-09-09 |publisher=BNet a CBS Company |accessdate=2008-07-22}}</ref>

The album contained the last two performances of [[Joe C.]] on "Devil Without a Cause" and "Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp," as well as Kid duetting with country star [[Gretchen Wilson]] on "Picture."

He brought [[Bob Seger]] back from semi-retirement during his pre-Super Bowl concerts on February 2 and 3, 2006 in Detroit. The two performed a version of Seger's "Rock 'N' Roll Never Forgets" on both nights. Kid Rock would appear on Bob Seger's album, ''Face The Promise'', on a [[Vince Gill]] cover of "Real Mean Bottle," a tribute to country legend [[Merle Haggard]].

==Influences and sound==
Kid Rock's genre-spanning sound incorporates a wide variety of musical styles and influences, ranging from classic rock and hip-hop to country. Rock's earliest exposure to music was via the classic rock and country albums of his parents. As rap and hip-hop gained mainstream prominence during the 1980s, Kid Rock was influenced by [[Beastie Boys]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} [[Run-D.M.C.]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and [[Too Short|Too $hort]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} who went on to produce Rock's first album. The "acid rap" style of Detroit rapper [[Esham]] was also an influence on Kid Rock's sound.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hess |first1=Mickey |title=Hip Hop in America: A Regional Guide: Volume 1: East Coast and West Coast |year=2009 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=0313343233 |pages=411<U+2013>413 |chapter=Esham }}</ref>

==Twisted Brown Trucker==
Twisted Brown Trucker is Kid Rock's band, formed in 1994 in [[Sterling Heights, Michigan]]. The original lineup included Kenny Olson on lead guitar, [[Uncle Kracker]] on turntables, Andy Gould and George Metropolous on guitar, Paul Anthony on bass and Bob Ebeling on drums. The band's first involvement was on the 1994 demo of ''Dark & Grey'' on his Bootleg Series Tapes, they would make three more appearances on the tapes in Watch Me Come, Only A Dog and Box #10. Trucker became both Rock's studio and live band in 1997.

Chris Peters was the studio guitarist for The Polyfuze Method and Fire It Up. Matt O'Brien (Bass) and Kenny Tudrick (Guitar, Drums) were studio musicians for Devil Without A Cause.

Olson went on to form a band called The Flask, who later switched singers and changed their name to Five Star Carnie. Tudrick is with the band Detroit Cobras who he was with before touring on Kid Rock's 'Live' Trucker tour.

Percussionist Larry Frantangelo won a Detroit Music Award in 2009 for Outstanding Urban/Funk Musician.
