'''Hampton National Historic Site''', in the [[Hampton, Maryland|Hampton]] area north of [[Towson, Maryland|Towson]], [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], [[United States]], preserves a remnant of a vast 18th-century estate, including a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] manor house, gardens, grounds, and the original stone [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] quarters. The estate was owned by the Ridgely family for seven generations, from 1745 to 1948. The '''Hampton Mansion''' was the largest private home in America when it was completed in 1790 and today is considered to be one of the finest examples of Georgian architecture in the U.S.<ref name=AP>{{cite news|last=Nuckols|first=Ben|title=Md.'s Hampton Mansion awaits rediscovery|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=December 24, 2007|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap_travel/20071224/ap_tr_ge/travel_trip_hampton_mansion|accessdate=2009-03-29}}</ref> Its furnishings, together with the estate's slave quarters and other preserved structures, provide insight into the life of late 18th-century and early 19th-century landowning aristocracy.

==History==
===18th century===
The property was originally part of the Northampton land grant given to Col. Henry Darnall (c. 1645&ndash;1711), a relative of [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore|Lord Baltimore]], in 1695.<ref name=Arcadia /> His heirs sold the land on April 2, 1745, to Col. Charles Ridgely (1702&ndash;72), a tobacco farmer and trader. The bill of sale records that the property included "... houses, tobacco houses ([[tobacco barn]]s), stables, gardens, and orchards."<ref name=Arcadia /><ref>{{cite book |title=A Guidebook to Hampton National Historic Site  |last=Hastings |first=Lynne Dakin  |year=1986 |publisher= Historic Hampton |location=Towson, Md. }}</ref> [[Image:Charles Carnan Ridgely.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Carnan Ridgely]], Hampton's second master]] By the late 1750s, Hampton extended to more than {{convert|10000|acre|ha}} and included an [[ironworks]].<ref name=Arcadia /> His son, Captain [[Charles Ridgely]] (1733&ndash;90), expanded the family business considerably to include [[gristmill]]s, apple orchards, and stone quarries. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], the ironworks was a significant source of income for the Ridgelys, producing cannons and ammunition for the [[Continental Army]].<ref name=NPS04>{{cite web|last=Curtis|first=William Blair|title=Hampton History|publisher=[[National Park Service|U.S. National Park Service]]|year=2004|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/hamp/history.htm|accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref> In 1783, Capt. Ridgely began construction of the main house, Hampton Mansion. He said its concept was inspired by [[Castle Howard]] in England, owned by relatives of his mother.<ref name=NPS04 /> When it was completed in 1790, the Hampton Mansion was the largest private home in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hampton Mansion awaits rediscovery|date=December 31, 2007|publisher=CNN.com|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/TRAVEL/getaways/12/31/hampton.mansion.ap/index.html|accessdate=2008-01-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080103152259/http://www.cnn.com/2007/TRAVEL/getaways/12/31/hampton.mansion.ap/index.html |archivedate = January 3, 2008}}</ref> 

When Capt. Ridgely died that same year, his nephew, [[Charles Carnan Ridgely]] (1760&ndash;1829), became the second master of Hampton.<ref name=NPS04 /> He had {{convert|10590|ft|0}} of irrigation pipes laid in 1799 from a nearby spring to provide water to the Mansion and the surrounding gardens, which he was extensively developing.<ref name=HHI>{{cite journal|title=Gardens & Grounds &ndash; Hampton National Historic Site|publisher=Historic Hampton|year=1989}}</ref> Prominent artisans of the time were hired to design geometric formal gardens, which were planted on the Mansion's grounds between 1799 and 1801.<ref name=HHI /> An avid horseman, Charles Carnan also began raising [[Thoroughbred|Thoroughbred horses]] at Hampton, where he had a racetrack installed. A 1799 advertisement promoted the [[Stud farm|stud services]] of his racehorse, Grey Medley. Another of Ridgely's racehorses, Post Boy, won the Washington City Jockey Club cup.<ref>McKee, pp. 18<U+2013>19.</ref>

Under Charles Carnan Ridgely, Hampton reached its peak of {{convert|25000|acre|ha|0|abbr=on}} in the 1820s.<ref name=NPS04 /> The mansion overlooked a grand estate of orchards, ironworks, coal mining, marble quarries, mills, and mercantile interests.<ref name=NPShist>{{cite web |title=A Hampton Chronology, Hampton National Historic Site |publisher=[[National Park Service|U.S. National Park Service]] |date=2006-07-14 |url=http://www.nps.gov/hamp/historyculture/a-hampton-chronology.htm |accessdate=2008-02-11 }}</ref> The vast farm produced corn, beef cattle, dairy products, hogs, and horses.<ref name=Arcadia /> More than 300&nbsp;slaves worked the fields and served the household, making Hampton one of Maryland's largest slaveholding estates.<ref name=NPS04 /> Six [[parterres]] were designed on three terraced levels facing the mansion, planted with roses, [[Peony|peonies]], and seasonal flowers.<ref name=HHI /> In 1820, an [[orangery]] was built on the grounds.[[Image:1818-Lady-with-Harp-Eliza-Ridgely-Sully.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Thomas Sully]].

Charles Carnan Ridgely frequently entertained prominent guests in the Mansion's 51&nbsp;ft.&nbsp;x&nbsp;21&nbsp;ft. (16 m by 6.4 m) Great Hall, such as [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]], who was a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], and Revolutionary War general, the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]].<ref name=HHI /><ref name=NPS04 /> Charles Carnan served as [[governor of Maryland]] between 1816&ndash;19. When Governor Ridgely died in 1829, he freed Hampton's slaves in his will.<ref name=AP /> The Hampton estate was split among various heirs, with his son, John Carnan Ridgely {{nowrap|(1790&ndash;1867),}} inheriting the mansion and {{convert|4500|acre|km2}}.<ref name=NPShist /> The ironworks closed and thereafter the Ridgelys' income was primarily derived from farming, investments, and their stone quarries.<ref name=AP /><ref name=Arcadia /> John Carnan added plumbing, heating, and gas lighting to the mansion.<ref name=Arcadia /> 

[[Eliza Ridgely]] {{nowrap|(1803&ndash;67),}} his wife and the subject of [[Thomas Sully]]'s famous portrait, ''Lady with a Harp'',<ref name=NGA /> purchased many artworks and furnishings for the mansion. She was a noted [[Horticulture|horticulturist]] and had successively larger and more elaborate gardens cultivated on the grounds, with a large variety of flowers and shrubs grown in the estate's [[greenhouse]]s and tended by some of the 60&nbsp;slaves purchased by John Carnan Ridgely.<ref name=AP /><ref name=McKee67>McKee, p. 67.</ref> By the mid-19th century, the Hampton estate had one of the most extensive collections of citrus trees in the U.S., along with various exotic trees and plants gathered by Eliza Ridgely during her frequent travels to Europe and the Orient.<ref name=McKee67 /> In the warm months, the potted citrus plants were brought outside and arranged around the terraced gardens, then taken into the heated orangery during the winter.<ref name=HHI /> She had one section of the garden planted with colorful red, yellow, pink, and maroon [[coleus]] from Asia. In 1859,  Hampton's fame for lavish style was such that the author of a book on landscaping wrote, "It has been truly said of Hampton that it expresses more grandeur than any other place in America".<ref>{{cite book|last=Downing|first=A.

Shortly after the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] as [[President of the United States]], Charles Ridgely (the son of John Carnan and Eliza Ridgely) formed the pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Baltimore County Horse Guards at Hampton in January 1861, with himself as captain of the militia unit that he described as "[[States' rights#Civil War|states' rights]] gentlemen."<ref>{{cite book |author=Sheads, Scott Sumpter and Toomey, Daniel Carroll|title=Baltimore During the Civil War |publisher=Toomey Press |location=Linthicum, Maryland |date=1997 |id={{LCCN|||97060687}} |page=184 |isbn=0961267070 }}</ref> One of his militia's cavalry men, [[John Merryman|Lieut. John Merryman]], was subsequently arrested by the [[Union Army]] and imprisoned in May 1861 on a charge of [[treason]], sparking the landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case, ''[[Ex parte Merryman]]''. As the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] raged across the farmlands of Maryland and Pennsylvania at the [[Battle of Antietam]] (1862) and the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] (1863), the Ridgelys' Hampton estate remained untouched.<ref name=NPS04 /> 

Although Maryland, as a [[Border states (Civil War)|border state]], was exempted from U.S. President Abraham Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]], the [[Maryland General Assembly]] eliminated slavery in 1864. With the end of slavery, Hampton began to decline.<ref name=NPShist /> A number of the former slaves continued to work at Hampton as paid household servants but the Ridgelys had to hire other hands to work the farm.<ref name=AP /><ref name=Arcadia /> With the deaths of John and Eliza in 1867, their son Charles became the next master of Hampton. The mansion and the remaining {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} were subsequently inherited upon Charles' death in 1872 by Captain John Ridgely {{nowrap|(1851&ndash;1938).}}<ref name=NPShist /> Prominent guests continued to visit Hampton and enjoy its grounds, such as [[Theodore Roosevelt]].<ref name=HHI />

===20th century===
As nearby Baltimore grew and local agriculture declined, the Ridgelys found it increasingly difficult to maintain the property. Five of the six parterres were removed and replanted as a grass lawn. Some income was generated by producing cider from the estate's apple orchards and operating a dairy. In 1929, Capt. John Ridgely and his son, John Ridgely Jr., formed the Hampton Development Corporation and sold some of the remaining {{convert|1000|acre|0}} of land.<ref name=Arcadia /><ref name=NPS04 /> In 1938, John Ridgely, Jr. (1882&ndash;1959) became the sixth generation of the family to become master of Hampton. His company sold off large portions of the estate to a suburban housing development in the 1930s and 1940s, now known as the fashionable [[Hampton, Maryland|Hampton residential community]].<ref name=NPS04 /><ref>McKee, p. 63.</ref> [[Image:Hampton NHS 02.jpg|thumb|The Farm House, where John Ridgely Jr. moved in 1948]] The Hampton Mansion remained in the Ridgely family until 1948, when John Ridgely Jr. moved to the smaller Farm House on the property and the Mansion was acquired by the Avalon Foundation (now part of the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]]).<ref>McKee, pp. 62 and 105.</ref> The seventh and last generation of Ridgelys to live at the mansion was his son, John Ridgely III {{nowrap|(1911<U+2013>90)}}, who, after marrying Lillian Ketchum {{nowrap|(1908<U+2013>96)}} in the mid-1930s, continued to reside at the mansion with his wife until they both entered Army service during World War II.<ref>McKee, pp. 90<U+2013>92.</ref>

The Hampton Mansion and remaining {{convert|43|acre|0}} of the Ridgely estate were designated a [[national historical park|National Historic Site]] by the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] on June 22, 1948&mdash;the first site to be so selected on the basis of its historical significance and "outstanding merit as an architectural monument".<ref name=NPS04 /><ref>McKee, pp. 7 and 105.</ref> Hampton Mansion was opened to the public in May 1949 under the care of Preservation Maryland for the next thirty years (1949<U+2013>79).<ref name=Loudermilk>{{cite news|last=Loudermilk|first=Suzanne|title=Hampton Mansion's tearoom to become another piece of history after Dec. 31|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=1998-09-15|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/34069261.html?dids=34069261:34069261&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT|accessdate=2008-01-17 }}</ref> Work also began in 1949 to restore four of the site's six 19th-century parterres.

As part of the General Management Plan adopted by the NPS in 1998 for the estate's long-term planning and operation, the NPS began studying the mansion's security, safety, electrical systems, and environmental issues in 2000.<ref name=rtf>{{cite web|title=Install Fire Suppression System & Environmental Controls|date=November 9, 2004|publisher=[[National Park Service|U.S. National Park Service]]|url=http://usasearch.gov/search?v%3aproject=firstgov&v%3afile=viv_1086%4027%3aenwGuT&v%3astate=root%7croot&opener=full-window&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nps.gov%2fhamp%2fparkmgmt%2fupload%2fFINAL%2520Hampton%2520EA%25209%2520Nov.%25202004.doc&rid=Ndoc0&v%3aframe=redirect&rsource=firstgov-msn&v%3astate=%28root%29%7croot&rrank=0&h=b616d986307c97db64e31ea22597211a&|format=[[Rich Text Format|RTF]]|accessdate=2009-03-27}}</ref> Critical needs were identified, such as the lack of a fire suppression system and climate control.

==The Tea Room controversy==
[[Image:Hampton-NHS.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Mansion front facade detail]]
When the Hampton estate first opened to the public in 1949, the mansion's kitchen was converted into a small restaurant. Known as the Tea Room, it was operated by a concessionaire for the next 50 years, serving lunches featuring Hampton Imperial Crab (backfin lump meat from the [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]], baked and seasoned with spices) and other [[Chesapeake Bay]] seafood delicacies, served with a glass of [[sherry]]. A local newspaper columnist described the Tea Room as "offering gentility ... a fireplace nearly as big as a wall and [[mullion]]ed windows with sills that are nearly {{convert|2|ft|m}} thick. The view is rolling lawns..."<ref name=Loudermilk /><ref name=TT>{{cite news|title=Steeped in tradition, tea room was place for genteel |work=Towson Times |date=1999-01-28 | url=http://news.mywebpal.com/news_tool_v2.cfm?pnpid=659&show=archivedetails&ArchiveID=1222471&om=1 |accessdate=2008-01-19}}</ref>

When the Tea Room was closed by the National Park Service on January 1, 1999, officials said they did so because of the potential fire hazard posed by operating a kitchen in the main park building and the possibility of insect or rodent damage to historic items in the mansion, as stated in the General Management Plan adopted by the NPS the previous year. While it "may be a pleasant place to enjoy a meal... that is clearly less important than the need to preserve Hampton's buildings, objects and landscapes for future generations," the Park Service stated.<ref name=TT /> Officials of Preservation Maryland said they were "disappointed" by the restaurant's closure, saying it helped attract visitors to the historic site. The former chairwoman of the Hampton women's committee<U+2014>which raises money for various projects at Hampton<U+2014>also criticized the decision.<ref name=Loudermilk /> Since 2006, the women's group has renewed efforts to have the Tea Room reopened, saying it would draw more visitors and repeat business from locals to the park. A Park Service spokesman was quoted as saying in October, 2006, that "The mansion is not going to be the site of any food operation," but has made no further comment since then.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ingraham|first=Loni|title='Brewhaha': Ladies want tea room opened|work=Towson Times|date=2006-10-18|url=http://news.mywebpal.com/news_tool_v2.cfm?pnpid=659&shobw=archivedetails&ArchiveID=1222484&om=1 |accessdate=2008-01-tb19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Scheeler|first=Mary Katherine|title=Hampton house named Towson Person of Year|work=Towson Times|date=2008-01-02|url=http://news.mywebpal.com/news_tool_v2.cfm?pnpid=659&show=archivedetails&ArchiveID=1327666&om=1 |accessdate=2008-01-19 }}</ref>
