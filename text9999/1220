'''''Death Cult Armageddon''''' is the sixth [[studio album]] by [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[symphonic black metal]] band [[Dimmu Borgir]],  released on 8 September 2003. It has since sold over 100,000 copies in the United States; the first album under Nuclear Blast to do so; and debuted on the [[Billboard 200]] chart at number 169.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BlabberMouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=47437 |title=Dimmu Borgir's 'Death Cult Armageddon' Surpasses 100,000 Mark According To Soundscan |accessdate=2008-09-19 |date=January 26, 2006 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth]]}}</ref> The song "Progenies of the Great Apocalypse"  is released as single with accompanying [[music video]]. The prior song featuring additional vocals from [[Abbath]]; along with "Heavenly Perverse"; being used, with "Eradication Instincts Defined", as background music in the ''[[Hellboy (film)|Hellboy]]'' film trailer, on the soundtrack to the videogame [[Br<U+00FC>tal Legend]], and was featured as the theme song to the TV show [[Battle for Ozzfest]]. "Eradication Instincts Defined" was also used in a trailer for the film ''[[Stardust (2007 film)|Stardust]]'' and the independent game "Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet". Parts of the album were recorded with the [[Prague Philharmonic Orchestra]]. This would also be the last album to have [[Nicholas Barker]] on drums.

The artwork within the album displays what appears to be an industrial factory, inside of which the band members are living out their fantasies, some of which are similar to scenes seen in the music video for Progenies of the Great Apocalypse. Artwork was done by Swiss artist Joachim Luetke. Most of the songs have a common [[apocalyptic]] theme, and the track "Unorthodox Manifesto" features a rhythmic motif taken from the Terminator films.

This is also their first album to feature their third and current logo.
