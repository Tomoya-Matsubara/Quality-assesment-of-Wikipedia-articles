Before the {{by|2005}} season, the Expos relocated to Washington and became the [[Washington Nationals]]. ''[[Baseball America]]'' also named Balester the 10th best prospect in the Nationals organization and listed him as having the best [[fastball]] of any minor leaguer in their system,<ref>[http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/features/04top10s/nationals.html Top Ten Prospects: Washington Nationals], ''[[Baseball America]]'', January 4, 2005.</ref> which could be thrown at a maximum of 95 [[miles per hour]].<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A16621-2005Jan17.html Top 10 Prospects], [[The Washington Post]], January 18, 2005.</ref> To begin the season, Balester joined the Class-A [[Savannah Sand Gnats]] and made his debut for the club on April 11, giving up just three hits in six innings and being awarded with the win.<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CL&s_site=ledgerenquirer&p_multi=CL&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=1096D66186E6999B&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM Gnats beat 'Fish], [[Columbus Ledger-Enquirer]], April 11, 2005.</ref> In a start against the [[Greensboro Grasshoppers]] on July 10, Balester allowed just one hit in eight innings of work, prompting ''[[Greensboro News & Record]]'' columnist Bill Hass to claim that, "The young right-hander [Balester] turned the Hoppers hitters into traffic cones."<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=GB&p_theme=gb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10B4795E91DD41E8&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM HEY, 19: BALESTER THROWS HIS 'BEST' AGAINST HOPPERS], [[Greensboro News & Record]], July 10, 2005.</ref> On July 29, ''Baseball America'' mentioned Balester as a breakout player, along with [[infielder]] [[Kory Casto]].<ref>[http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/minors/050729pulse.html Prospect Pulse], Baseball America, July 29, 2005.</ref> In 24 games for Savannah, 23 of which were starts, he went 8&ndash;6 with a 3.67 ERA, and a 1.176 WHIP.<ref name="BRM"/> After the season, Baseball America listed Balester as the second-best prospect in the Nationals system, behind [[third baseman]] [[Ryan Zimmerman]].<ref>[http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/features/05top10s/nationals.html Top Ten Prospects: Washington Nationals], ''Baseball America'', November 16, 2005.</ref>

Balester began the {{by|2006}} season with the High-A [[Potomac Nationals]], where he got off to a bad start, going 1&ndash;3 with a 6.91 in nine starts. On the bad start, Balester said, "It kind of has been hard. I did so well last year. I think it's going to be good for me that I am failing a little bit more so that I know how to fail. I know I can use this in the future." He also added that, "I get way too high expectations for myself and I've got to realize I am only 19 years old."<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0TEzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0ggGAAAAIBAJ&pg=3925,72823&dq=collin+balester&hl=en A step up, Balester steps back], [[The Free Lance-Star]], June 1, 2006.</ref> In late August, after going 4&ndash;5 with a 5.20 ERA and a 1.521 WHIP in 22 starts for Potomac<ref name="BRM"/>, Balester was called up to Double-A [[Harrisburg Senators|Harrisburg]].

He pitched five innings, [[strikeout|striking out]] three, and allowing one hit in a 9&ndash;6 Nationals win.

In [[Spring Training]] {{by|2009}}, Balester was part of a battle with [[Jordan Zimmermann]] and [[Shairon Martis]] for the final two spots in the Nationals rotation.<ref>[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/mar/25/nationals-report-88033376/ Rizzo not afraid to go young], The Washington Times, March 25, 2009.</ref> However, he eventually lost the battle and was optioned to the Triple-A [[Syracuse Chiefs]] to begin the season. During Spring Training, he went 1&ndash;1 with a 6.75 ERA, prompting Nationals manager [[Manny Acta]] to state that, "We need Collin to go down there and get some consistency on his command and three pitches. He took the news very well. He is going to go down there and work hard. I'm sure we are going to be seeing him this year and for years to come."<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090328&content_id=4080438&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb Martis, Zimmermann round out rotation], MLB.com, March 28, 2009.</ref> On July 23, after Zimmermann was placed on the 15-Day [[Disabled List]], Balester was called up to take his place in the rotation.<ref>[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jul/23/zimmermann-heads-to-dl-as-precaution/ Zimmermann heads to DL], The Washington Times, July 23, 2009.</ref> On August 25, the Nationals signed [[Liv<U+00E1>n Hern<U+00E1>ndez]] from [[free agency]] and to make room on the roster, optioned Balester to Triple-A.

On March 15, 2010, Balester was sent to minor league training camp, ensuring that he would start the {{by|2010}} season in Syracuse.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/2010-03-15-3396424881_x.htm Nats release Villone, option 5 pitchers to minors], Associated Press, March 15, 2010.</ref> To start the season, Balester recorded a 11.65 ERA in five starts for the Chiefs, prompting the Nationals to send him to extended spring training in order for him to convert to being a relief pitcher.<ref>[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/nationalsjournal/2010/06/collin_balesters_new_role.html Collin Balester's new role], The Washington Post, June 3, 2010.</ref> On July 24, Balester was called up by the Nationals to replace [[Luis Atilano]], who had been placed on the disabled list.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/2010-07-24-3396424881_x.htm Nationals recall RHP Balester], Associated Press, July 25, 2010.</ref> That day, he came in to the game to replace [[J. D. Martin]] and hit [[Milwaukee Brewers]] [[second baseman]] [[Rickie Weeks]] in the head with a fastball. However, Weeks played the following day.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=300725108 Nationals 3, Brewers 8], [[ESPN.com]], July 25, 2010.</ref> Nine days later, Balester again hit a batter in the head, this time it was [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] third baseman [[Mark Reynolds]]. Much like Weeks, Reynolds was fine, but Balester still commented that, "ou don't want to do that kind of stuff. It's the second time I did that, but it's one of those things you never want to have happen in your career. It's obviously unintentional. It's not a good situation to be in."<ref>[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/nationalsjournal/2010/08/collin_balesters_repeat_shakin.html Collin Balester's repeat 'shaking' performance], The Washington Post, August 4, 2010.</ref> On August 8, Balester was optioned back to Syracuse,<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/08/AR2010080803032.html Nationals fall to Dodgers, 8-3, as Jason Marquis returns to mound], The Washington Post, August 8, 2010.</ref> only to be recalled on August 24, when [[Stephen Strasburg]] was placed on the disabled list.<ref>[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/nationalsjournal/collin-balester-recalled_pf.html Collin Balester recalled], The Washington Post, August 24, 2010.</ref> However, a day later, he was sent back down to Triple-A.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/2010-08-25-2322619573_x.htm Cubs break through in 8th to win pitchers' duel], Associated Press, August 25, 2010.</ref> Balester was recalled again for a third time on September 5.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/2010-09-05-3304868772_x.htm Nationals bring up Balester, Maya may be next], Associated Press, September 5, 2010.</ref> In 35 games total games for Syracuse, he went 3&ndash;3 with a 5.87 ERA<ref name="BRM"/>, while in 17 games for Washington, he went 0&ndash;1 with a 2.57 ERA.<ref name="BR"/>
