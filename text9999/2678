'''James Robert Baker''' ([[October 18]], [[1946]] - [[November 5]] [[1997]]) was an American author of sharply satirical,   predominantly gay-themed [[transgressional fiction]]. A native Californian, his work is set almost entirely in [[Southern California]]. After graduating from [[UCLA]], he began his career as a screenwriter, but became disillusioned and started writing novels, instead. Though he garnered fame for his books ''Fuel-Injected Dreams'' and ''Boy Wonder'', after the controversy surrounding publication of his novel, ''Tim And Pete'', he faced increasing difficulty having his work published. This was a contributing factor in his suicide.

Baker's work has achieved cult status in the years since his death, and two additional novels have been posthumously published. First edition copies of his earlier works have become collector's items. In recent years, three of his novels have either been filmed or optioned for the movies.
==Early years==
Baker was raised in what he considered a "stifling, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Southern Californian household".<ref name="Baker">Robertson's official Baker website</ref> Rebelling against his parents, he became attracted to the fringe elements of society, including [[beatnik]]s (anyone living as a bohemian, acting rebelliously, or appearing to advocate a revolution in manners<ref>{{cite web | title=Beat Writers | date=[[2005-04-30]] | url=http://www.bluesforpeace.com/beat.htm | accessdate=2006-10-30 }}</ref>), artists and homosexuals.<ref name="Baker"/> He also explored his homosexuality at underground gay teen nightclubs, while living in fear that his "right wing, psycho" father would find out. At one point, his father actually hired a private detective to follow him, when he suspected Baker was having an affair with a male neighbor.<ref name="Roy">Roy Rivenburg, Los Angeles Times, April 8, 1993; Page E-1,</ref> This family dynamic would be used in many of his novels, most extensively in ''Boy Wonder''.

Baker began experimenting with drugs, and became, in his own words, "an out of control, teenage speed freak".<ref name="Roy"/> He also began drinking heavily, attributing it to the fact that he was still a [[closeted]] homosexual. However, even after [[coming out]], his substance abuse remained excessive and "still had a life of its own".<ref name="Roy"/> After sobering up, he attended [[UCLA]] film school, where he was one of the winners of the [[Samuel Goldwyn Writing Awards]],<ref name="Obit">New York Times, November 24, 1997; Section B; Page 7; Column 2</ref> and directed two films: ''Mouse Klub Konfidential'' and ''Blonde Death''. ''Mouse Klub Konfidential'', a film about a [[Mickey Mouse Club]] Mouseketeer who becomes a [[bondage (BDSM)|gay-bondage]] pornographer, was a very controversial entry in the 1976 San Francisco Gay and Lesbian Film Festival.<ref name="LATimes">L.A. Times, November 15, 1997, page A-20</ref> Many thought Baker was actually advocating [[Naziism]]. It is also credited with having caused [[Michael Medved]] to abandon his dream of film making and become a film critic, instead.<ref name="Baker"/><ref>{{cite web | title=Amazon.com Author Information Page | url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/155583714X/ref=dp_proddesc_0/002-6334177-6845610?ie=UTF8&n=283155&s=books/ | accessdate=2006-10-30 }}

==Writer==

Baker's lifelong ambition was to write. Upon graduating  from UCLA, he spent approximately 5 years writing Hollywood screenplays, a process he hated. While financially successful, he was frustrated that his work was not being produced. "I felt like a door-to-door salesman going to all these [story] pitch meetings...[filled with] rabid, hideous morons".<ref name="Roy"/>  He became discouraged and disillusioned, and turned his attention to novels. In the beginning this was just a secondary occupation, but after the release of  ''Fuel-Injected Dreams'', his second novel, he stopped screenwriting in order to solely concentrate on books. He spent the bulk of each day writing and researching, and acted out characters and scenes of his novels on videotape to perfect the dialogue.<ref name="Baker"/>

His primary focus was gay-themed writing, though he also wrote about the entertainment industry. Mostly satirical, his writing was filled with increasingly clear anger and disdain for the Republican [[Neoconservatism|neo-con]] agenda, especially after [[AIDS]] began to take such a large toll on the gay community.<ref name="Roy"/> A very strong voice in [[gay literature]], Mr. Baker had admirers and detractors for his gay radical stance, both in the mainstream literary community as well as the gay community itself.<ref name="Planet">{{cite web | title=PlanetOut Book Review | url=http://www.planetout.com/entertainment/books/reviews/baker.html | accessdate=2006-10-30 }}</ref>

A self-described [[anarchist]],<ref name="LATimes"/> Baker's writing can also be categorized as [[transgressional fiction]],<ref name="Gary">Gary Luke, Lambda Book Report, April 30, 1993, Vol.3; No.9; Pg.12</ref> in that his novels are frequently populated by sociopathic, nihilistic characters who engage in taboo behaviors such as heavy drug use, incest, necrophilia and other aberrant sexual practices; and often commit acts of extreme, surrealistic violence. A man of eclectic tastes, Baker cited as literary influences writers and film directors ranging from [[Proust]] to [[Jim Thompson]] and [[Sam Peckinpah]]. He also admired the punk writer [[Dennis Cooper]].<ref name="Gary"/>[[Image:Adrenaline.jpg|thumb|right| ''[[Adrenaline]]'' (1985)]]
His work is filled with pop cultural references to both film  and music, as well as politics. [[Orson Welles]]' "[[Touch of Evil]]" and [[John Ford]]'s "[[The Searchers]]" are mentioned prominently in more than one of his books, and [[Roxy Music]] is referenced in virtually every novel he wrote. The imagery in his novels is largely cinematic, with expressions such as "fade in/[[fade out]]", "quick cut" and "[[VistaVision]]"; and sentences such as "a montage traces the next fifteen years" and "If the last reel of Cheryl's life had been a [[CinemaScope]] [[Technicolor]] movie...".<ref>{{cite web | title=New York Times Book Review | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DEFD7163DF937A35756C0A960948260 | accessdate=2006-10-30 }}</ref> With driven narratives, his books have the feel of a movie set down on paper.

His first book, ''Adrenaline'', was published under the [[pseudonym]] James Dillinger. A story of two gay fugitive lovers on the run, it presaged the satire and drug fueled violence so prominent in his later books. Here Baker began developing the themes that dominated his following works: anarchy; angry and somewhat paranoid gay men; the dark underside of Los Angeles, juxtaposed with its sunny outward image; the hypocrisy of organized religion; anonymous sex and its implications in the age of AIDS; and homophobia and the oppression of gays in a Republican dominated America.<ref name="3AM">{{cite web | title=3AMmagazine | url=http://3ammagazine.com/magazine/issue_5/articles/testosterone_review.html | accessdate=2006-10-30 }}</ref>

<br>See Also: Up-Front or Undercover?; Dan Levy, The San Francisco Chronicle, June 20, 1993; Section: Sunday Review; Pg. 9<br></ref> Its [[plot device]] of underdog characters forced into flight due to circumstances beyond their control was one Baker explored in all of his subsequent work. The modest success of this novel encouraged him to devote himself to what have become his best known works, ''Boy Wonder'' and ''Fuel-Injected Dreams'' (a novel revolving around a character loosely based on [[record producer]] [[Phil Spector]]).<ref name="Roy"/>

==Controversy==

Baker's work received mixed reviews. His only two books not specifically gay themed (though containing gay characters and a somewhat gay sensibility), ''Boy Wonder'' and ''Fuel-Injected Dreams'', were more well received by critics,<ref>New York Times, September 4, 1988</ref><ref>Press release of clippings from Baker's agent</ref> and more popular with readers, though he was never a bestselling novelist. Baker himself estimated that his books sold approximately 25,000 copies each.<ref name="LATimes"/> His following book, however, ''Tim And Pete'', met with hostile reviews, primarily for its advocacy of political assassination and terror tactics in combatting AIDS discrimination. Baker himself was ambivalent on the subject. "I think assassination does change things...But I'm not really calling for violence," he said. "It's a novel, not a position paper."<ref name="LATimes"/>

In a 1993 interview, however, Baker stated: 

{{cquote|I think a strong case can be made that political assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 60's you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's [People With AIDS] turn themselves into human bombs, but on the other hand I have to admit that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown [[Patrick Buchanan]]'s head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.<ref name="Rich">{{cite web | title=The Last Angry Gay Man? | url=http://www.axiongrafix.com/baker.html | accessdate=2006-10-30 }}</ref>}}
[[Image:tim-pete2.jpg|thumb|right| ''[[Tim And Pete]]'' (1993)]]
There were also charges of racism, due to his portrayals of blacks and Hispanics. Baker denied those charges, and pointed out that the protagonist later realized that the blacks were also gay and the Latina "was just a sweet old woman putting up with a lot of (stuff) that I couldn't even imagine."<ref name="Roy"/> He went on to say, "I just wanted to explore the conflicts between gays and Latinos and gays and blacks...the real feelings [and the] misapprehensions of each other. I realized it wouldn't all be nice and politically correct. If blacks (and Latinos) want my respect, they have to deal with their own homophobia. I'm not playing guilty liberal anymore".<ref name="Roy"/>

The book caused a great deal of controversy among critics, with some calling it "irresponsible", and saying it was "determined to give offense" and "appears to endorse violence".<ref>Bernard Welt, Love and Death in the Gay Novel, Book World; Page X7 October 14, 1993</ref> One critic of the book went so far as to write, "The work rapidly becomes an apology for political terrorism and effectively advocates the assassination of the entire American New Right. While the reasons for such a vengeance motif are perhaps evident, can it really be countenanced? Are we still justified in referring to this as art? And even if we are, is there a point at which such invective (and such suggestions) become simply counterproductive?"<ref>Mark Pegrum, Mots pluriels; Vol.1. no 3. 1997</ref> Another critic, however, called it "a masterful creation" and wrote, "in coming years Baker will be seen as having understood the implications of this period in our history while the rest of us were simply living it".<ref>Michael Lowenthal, Lambda Book Report, April 30, 1993, Vol.3; No.9; Pg.14</ref> It polarized the reading public, as well, with letters to the editor of major newspapers both supporting and opposing Baker's ideology.<ref>Los Angeles Times, April 19, 1993, Monday, Home Edition, View; Part E; Page 2; Column 1</ref> Baker himself was aware that the book would be controversial, and deliberately provoked much of the reaction he received. He said, "''Tim and Pete'' tries to convey in print what people really think rather than what they should think or what's P.C...My fantasy was to leave readers so infuriated they'd throw down the book and march right out to a gun store because they wanted to see the finale so bad they realize the only way it'd happen is if they make it happen in real life!"<ref name="Rich"/>

==Death==
After the reception of ''Tim And Pete'', with several critics calling him "The Last Angry Gay Man",<ref name="3AM">
<br>See Also: Ben Ehrenreich, "A Quitter, A Chicana Role Model And One Angry Queer"; LA Weekly, July 28, 2000; Cover Story; Pg. 34</br></ref><ref name="Rich"/> Baker faced increasing difficulty finding a publisher for his work and his financial position became precarious.<ref>{{cite web | title=Knitting Circle | url=http://www.knittingcircle.org.uk/jamesbaker.html | accessdate=2006-10-30 }}</ref> He was only able to publish one novella, ''Right Wing'', and that was self published on the internet.<ref name="Baker"/>          
This exacerbated a natural propensity towards [[depression]]. He was prescribed [[antidepressant]] medication, which he disliked, and was non-compliant in the therapy. Baker committed [[suicide]] at his home on November 5, 1997.<ref name="Obit"/>

His death was noted in literary circles, with obituaries printed in newspapers ranging from ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Los Angeles  Times]]'' to the ''[[Gay Times]]'' in the United Kingdom. The ''Gay Times'' wrote that, "Baker's suicide is particularly tragic because it robs American gay writing of a refreshingly distinctive voice quite unlike the po-faced prose of so many of his contemporaries."<ref>Gay Times, January, 1998, issue 232, page 69</ref>

==Legacy==

Since his death, Baker's reputation has steadily increased among critics and the reading public; and his works now have cult status in the literary community.<ref name="Planet"/> <ref>{{cite web | title=Forward Magazine | url=http://www.forewordmagazine.com/reviews/viewreviews.aspx?reviewID=1997 | accessdate=2006-10-30 }}

One of those, ''Testosterone'', was filmed in 2003. Directed by David Moreton and starring [[Antonio Sabato Jr.]], the plot was significantly altered and the film was a critical and financial failure. Both ''Boy Wonder'' and ''Fuel-Injected Dreams'' have been optioned for the movies several times, most recently in 2004, though they were never produced. Baker's work has also been published in Germany, Sweden, Italy, Great Britain, Australia, Japan and Russia.<ref>{{cite web | title=Awfulagent.com | url= http://www.awfulagent.com/reviews/baker2.html#BW | accessdate=2006-10-31 }}</ref><ref name="Baker"/>

Though ''Tim And Pete'' was his most controversial work, ''Boy Wonder'' is generally considered his [[Magnum opus]], and remains his most popular book.<ref>{{cite web | title=Christian Sauve | url= http://www.christian-sauve.com/reviews/2000/books00h.htm#Boy | accessdate=2006-10-31 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=McLoughlin | url= http://www.christian-mclaughlin.com/reading.html| accessdate=2006-10-31 }}</ref> A black satire of the film industry, it is also a parody of the "oral biographies" popularized by [[George Plimpton]] with his books about [[Edie Sedgwick]] and [[Truman Capote]], in that the protagonist's life is revealed in the form of interviews between the writer and the characters. Though it has been praised as "one of the few novels from the last couple of decades that could justifiably be called a classic", reviewers have also pointed out that it is probably unfilmable due to its bitter cynicism regarding the movie industry.<ref>{{cite web | title=Alwyn W. Turner, TrashFiction | url= http://www.trashfiction.co.uk/boy_wonder.html| accessdate=2006-10-31 }}</ref> 

Baker's last published work, ''Right Wing'', as well as his posthumous novels ''Testosterone'' and ''Anarchy'', represent a stylistic departure in that he inserts himself into the plot as either a secondary character or the protagonist. The latter two were edited, and in the case of ''Anarchy'', partially rewritten by his editor, Scott Brassart.<ref name="Scott">Scott Bressart, Anarchy, Alyson Publications, 2004, pages 251-255</ref> ''Testosterone'' needed only minor changes, while "''Anarchy''" underwent an entire rewrite, with Mr. Brassart restructuring the plot and streamlining over 500 pages of prose and notes into a fast paced, 250 page novel. For the reader, however, it is only Baker's voice as writer that is heard.<ref name="Scott"/>

Three of Mr. Baker's books have thus far not been published. They are ''White Devils'', ''Proto Punk'', and ''Crucifying Todd''. Additionally, he wrote two screenplays which have not as yet been filmed: ''Inez'' and ''Desert Women''.<ref name="Baker"/>
