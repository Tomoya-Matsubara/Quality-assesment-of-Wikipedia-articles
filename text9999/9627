The '''Siege of Quer<U+00E9>taro''' was the culminating battle of the [[French Intervention in Mexico]] and the [[Second Mexican Empire]]. It took place between Republican and Imperial armies from 6 March to 15 May 1867.

The Republican victory at [[Quer<U+00E9>taro]] effectively ended the war of the Second French Intervention. [[Emperor Maximilian I]] was captured and condemned to death by a court martial on June 14; resulting in his execution by firing squad on the morning of June 19 at the [[Cerro de las Campanas]].<ref>RIVA PALACIOS, Vicente (1940).
