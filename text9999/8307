'''Augustin Banyaga''' (born March 31, 1947) is a Rwandan-born [[United States|America]]n [[mathematician]] whose research fields include [[symplectic topology]] and [[contact geometry]]. He is currently a Professor of Mathematics at [[Pennsylvania State University]].

==Biography==
Banyaga earned his [[Ph.D.]] degree in 1976 at the [[University of Geneva]] under the supervision of [[Andr<U+00E9> Haefliger]].  He was a member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] (1977<U+2013>1978),<ref>[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/frontpage?page=8 Institute for Advanced Study: A Community of Scholars]</ref> [[Benjamin Peirce]] Assistant Professor at [[Harvard University]](1978<U+2013>1982), and Assistant Professor at [[Boston University]] (1982<U+2013>1984), before joining the faculty at Pennsylvania State University in 1984 as Associate Professor.  He was promoted to Full Professor in 1992.  

He has made significant contributions in symplectic topology, especially on the structure of [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] of [[diffeomorphism]]s preserving a symplectic form ([[symplectomorphism]]s).  One of his best-known results states that the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a [[compact space|compact]], [[Connectedness|connected]], [[symplectic manifold]] is a [[simple group]]; in particular, it does not admit any non-trivial [[homomorphism]] to the real line. 

Banyaga is an editor of ''[[Afrika Matematica]]'', the journal of the [[African Mathematical Union]], and an editor of the ''[[African Journal of Mathematics]]''.  He has supervised the theses of 7 Ph.D. students.
