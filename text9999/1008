The '''First Test of the 1948 Ashes series''' was one of five [[test cricket|Tests]] in a [[cricket]] [[1948 Ashes series|series]] between [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[England national cricket team|England]]. The match was played at [[Trent Bridge]] in [[Nottingham]] from June 10 to 15, with a rest day on June 13. Australia won the match by eight wickets to take a 1<U+2013>0 series lead.

England captain [[Norman Yardley]] won the [[toss (cricket)|toss]] and elected to bat on a cloudy day. After the first morning was interrupted by inclement weather, the Australian [[fast bowling|fast bowlers]] quickly made inroads into the English batting. Despite the loss of leading Australian paceman [[Ray Lindwall]] with a groin injury, the hosts had difficulty against his colleagues and fell to be 74 runs for the loss of eight wickets (74/8). However, a rearguard action by [[tail-ender]]s [[Alec Bedser]] and [[Jim Laker]] saw England reach 165, [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] taking five wickets for 36 runs (5/36) for Australia. The tourists then reached 17 without loss [[Stumps#End_of_the_day's_play|by stumps]].

On the second day, Yardley attempted to slow the Australian batsmen by employing [[leg theory]], a defensive strategy that sought more to contain the opposition than to attack. Despite this, Australia reached 293/4 at the end of the day's play, captain [[Donald Bradman]] having registered his 28th Test [[century (cricket)|century]]. The next morning, Bradman departed for 138, but his vice-captain [[Lindsay Hassett]] continued, making 137 and putting on a century partnership with Lindwall as Australia were eventually out for 509, giving them a 344-run first innings lead. England reached 121/2 by stumps on the third day, which ended with a hostile crowd reaction to [[Keith Miller]], who bowled a large amount of [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncers]] at [[Len Hutton]] and [[Denis Compton]].

After the rest day, play resumed in poor visibility, with frequent interruptions due to rain and bad light. England's batsmen progressed steadily as Australia struggled in Lindwall's absence, which forced his fellow bowlers to bear a greater workload. Hutton made 74 and Compton batted through the entire day to be unbeaten on 154, with England one run ahead at the close of play. Compton's innings in the difficult conditions was highly praised. The next day, Australia prised out the remaining wickets and England were dismissed for 441, with Compton out for 184. Miller and Johnston had both taken four wickets. Australia then made the 98 runs required for victory with the loss of two wickets.

== June 10: Day One ==

England captain [[Norman Yardley]] won the [[toss (cricket)|toss]] and elected to bat. The first innings set the pattern of the series as the English top order struggled against Australia's pace attack. Only twenty minutes of play was possible before lunch on the first day due to inclement weather,<ref name=report1/> and the opening pair of Washbrook and Hutton had to deal with the contrasting bowling actions of Lindwall<U+2014>with a low, somewhat [[Roundarm bowling|round-arm]] action<U+2014>and Miller, who extracted more bounce from a higher arm at the point of delivery.<ref name=f83>Fingleton, p. 83.</ref> Miller induced an [[List of cricket terms#E|edge]] from Washbrook in his first [[over (cricket)|over]], but it bounced before reaching a fielder. In his second over, Miller [[bowled]] Hutton for three with a faster ball to leave England at 9/1. The ball went between bat and [[pads]] as Hutton moved forward onto his front foot.<ref name=sco1/><ref name="report1"/><ref name=f83/>

During the lunch interval, heavy rain fell, making the ball skid through upon England's resumption at 13/1.<ref name=f84>Fingleton, p. 84.</ref> Lindwall reached his peak speed and Edrich edged to [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|first slip]], where [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] got both hands to the ball above his head, but failed to hold on. Edrich was on four at the time. The next ball from Lindwall, Washbrook was caught on the run by Brown on the [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|fine leg boundary]] after attempting to [[Batting (cricket)#Types of batting shots|hook]] a [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]].<ref name=sco1/><ref name="report1"/><ref name=f84/> Washbrook's fall left England at 15/2 after 41 minutes of batting and brought Compton to the crease to join Edrich.<ref name="sco1"/> Compton [[Batting (cricket)#Types of batting shots|square drove]] Miller to the boundary for [[four (cricket)|four]], which prompted a retaliatory [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] and a negative crowd reaction.<ref name=f85>Fingleton, p. 85.</ref> Edrich was not scoring quickly but he defied the bowling of Miller and Lindwall as the English pair took the score to 46. During this period Brown made a series of one-handed run-saving stops in the field.<ref name=f85/>

Bradman then made a double change and brought on the two left-arm pacemen, [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] and [[Ernie Toshack]].<ref name=f85/> In his first over, Johnston bowled Edrich with a delivery that knocked the off stump out of the ground as the batsman leaned forward on the front foot. Two balls later, Johnston removed Hardstaff for a [[duck (cricket)|duck]], caught by Miller in [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|slips]] after attempting a [[Batting (cricket)#Types of batting shots|cut]]. ''[[Wisden]]'' described the catch as "dazzling".<ref name=sco1/><ref name="report1"/> Miller dived and balanced himself on his spine as he caught the ball heels over head.<ref name=f86>Fingleton, p. 86.</ref>

Bradman then decided to bring Miller back in place of Toshack.<ref name=f87>Fingleton, p. 87.</ref> Two runs later, Compton was bowled attempting a [[Batting (cricket)#Types of batting shots|leg sweep]] against Miller, his leg stump knocked out of the ground as he moved across his wickets.<ref name=f87/> Five English wickets had fallen with only 48 runs on the board after 100 minutes of play; three batsmen had been dismissed in just ten minutes.<ref name=sco1/><ref name="report1"/> The collapse left Barnett and captain Yardley as the new men at the crease.<ref name=sco1/> Both players attacked the bowling but could not get their shots through the field for runs. Soon after, Lindwall was forced to leave the field due to a groin injury and did not bowl again.<ref name="pol9">Pollard (1990), p. 9.</ref> Barnett hit one four before Johnston bowled him for eight as he leaned onto the front foot. This brought Evans to the crease with the score at 60/6. He drove the ball [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|forward of point]] to the boundary for four, and was then given two [[List of cricket terms#L|lives]]. He hit Johnston hard to [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|cover]], but the catch went through Bradman for another boundary. The second chance of a catch went through Bradman's hand and struck the Australian captain in the abdomen. However, the missed opportunities cost the tourists little; Evans hit a ball strongly but it was caught at close range at [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|short leg]] by Morris.<ref name=f87/> Without further addition to the score, Toshack trapped Yardley, who had lingered at the crease for 26 minutes in accumulating three runs, [[leg before wicket]] (lbw), leaving the score at 74/8.<ref name="sco1"/> England was facing the prospect of setting a new record for the lowest Test innings score at Trent Bridge, worse than the 112 made by England against [[Warwick Armstrong]]'s Australians in 1921.<ref name="report1"/> However, a late fightback averted the unwanted record. Laker and Bedser, both from [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]], joined forces and scored more than half of England's total, adding 89 runs in only 73 minutes. Laker's innings was highlighted by [[Batting (cricket)#Types of batting shots|hooking and driving]], while Bedser defended stoutly and drove in front of the wicket.<ref name="report1"/> Bedser was finally removed by Johnston and Miller had Laker caught behind two runs later, ending England's innings at 165.<ref name="sco1"/> Laker top-scored with 63 in 101 minutes, with six [[boundary (cricket)|boundaries]],<ref name="sco1"/> having reached his first 50 in only 60 minutes.<ref name=f87/> Johnston ended with 5/36, a display characterised with his accuracy and variations in pace and [[swing bowling|swing]].<ref name="report1"/> Miller took 3/38 and a catch, while Lindwall and Toshack took one wicket each.<ref name="p235"/> Spin was not used in abundance, as Johnson bowled five overs and Morris three.<ref name=sco1/> Following England's struggles in the first innings, many pundits criticised Yardley's decision to bat first.<ref>Fingleton, pp. 82<U+2013>88.</ref>

Australia had less than 15 minutes of batting before the scheduled close of play. Barnes made an [[list of cricket terms#L|appeal against the light]] after the first ball of the innings, which was a wide by Edrich.<ref name="report1"/> Barnes walked down the pitch and reportedly muttered to umpire [[Frank Chester (umpire)|Frank Chester]] in a casual tone "Eh, the light!", which allegedly shocked the arbiter. During the previous Ashes series in Australia, Barnes had continuously made time-wasting appeals against the light, which forced cricket administrators to limit the batting team to one appeal; if this was declined it would be up to the umpires to offer an adjournment.<ref name=f88>Fingleton, p. 88.</ref> Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the [[cricket ball|new ball]] bowling of Edrich and Bedser. They [[Stumps#End_of_the_day's_play|reached stumps]] at 17 without loss, with Morris on 10 and Barnes on six.<ref name="sco1"/>

== June 11: Day Two ==

Ideal batting conditions and clear weather greeted the players on the second day.<ref name=report1/> Barnes batted assuredly, while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the [[crease (cricket)|crease]]. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire Chester when the umpire failed to evade a drive from Morris and stopped it with his foot. Barnes then picked the ball off the ground and [[handled the ball|handed it]] to the bowler, prompting a finger-wagging from Chester, to which Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball.<ref>Fingleton, pp. 88<U+2013>89.</ref>

Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before the latter was bowled for 31 by Laker after two hours of batting.<ref name=sco1/> Bradman came in and Yardley set a defensive field, employing [[leg theory]] to slow the scoring. The English leader packed the [[leg side]] with fielders and ordered Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Bradman almost inside-edged the second ball onto his stumps, before defending uneasily for a period. With Laker stopping the scoring at the other end, Bradman managed only four runs in his first 20 minutes of batting.<ref name=f90>Fingleton, p. 90.</ref> Barnes then reached his half-century after 135 minutes, [[Batting (cricket)#Types of batting shots|pulling]] Barnett for four.<ref name=f91>Fingleton, p. 91.</ref>

The score had progressed to 121 when Barnes [[Batting (cricket)#Types of batting shots|tried to cut]] Laker, but only edged it onto the thigh of wicket-keeper Evans. The ball bounced away and the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62. Miller came in and was dismissed for a duck without further addition to Australia's total. He failed to pick Laker's [[arm ball]], which went straight on instead of turning inwards, thereby clipping the outside edge of his bat. The ball flew to [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|slip]] where Edrich completed the catch.<ref name="sco1"/><ref name="report1"/><ref name="p235">Perry (2005), p. 235.</ref><ref name=f91/>

Laker to this point had taken 3/22 from 12.4 overs, having also top-scored in the first innings.<ref name=sco1/><ref name="report1"/> All the while, Australia had been scoring slowly, as they would for most of the day. Brown came in at No. 5, but he had played most of his career as an opening batsman and looked unaccustomed to playing in the middle order.<ref name=f91/> Yardley removed Laker from the attack and took the second new ball. Bradman struck his first boundary in over 80 minutes, and Australia passed England's total before Yardley brought himself on to bowl, trapping Brown lbw with an [[off cutter]] in his first over.<ref name="report1"/><ref name=f91/> This ended a 64-run stand in 58 minutes and Hassett came in at 185/4.<ref name=sco1/> The Australian vice-captain came close to being caught when he knocked a ball from Bedser into the air, narrowly evading the grasp of Evans.<ref name=f91/>

Yardley continued to employ a leg side field as he and Barnett bowled outside leg stump. During one over, Bradman did not attempt a single shot and then put his hands on his hips to express his displeasure at England's tactics. During the 15 minutes before tea, the Australian captain did not add a single run and was heckled by the crowd. Bradman reached tea on 78, and 55 minutes after the resumption of play, he [[Batting (cricket)#Types of batting shots|cover drove]] Bedser to reach his [[century (cricket)|century]] in 218 minutes.<ref name=f92>Fingleton, p. 92.</ref> It was his 28th [[List of international cricket centuries by Donald Bradman|Test century]], and his 18th in Ashes Tests.<ref name=f92/> The last 29 runs took 70 minutes to accumulate, and it was one of Bradman's slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking wickets.<ref name="report1">{{Cite web|title= First Test Match England v Australia |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949 |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152894.html |accessdate=2008-07-02 |publisher=[[Wisden]]}}</ref>

Bradman added a further 30 in the last hour to end with 130. Hassett also batted patiently, with one period of 20 minutes during which his score remained on 30.<ref name=f92/> Australia batted [[List of cricket terms#S|to stumps]] on the second day without further loss, ending at 293/4, a lead of 128, with Hassett on 41.<ref name="sco1"/> After the day's play, former Australian Test [[leg spin]]ner [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]]<U+2014>a former teammate of Bradman who was covering the tour as a journalist<U+2014>consulted Bedser on his use of leg theory.

== June 12: Day Three ==

[[Image:HassettMcCormick.jpg|right|130px|thumb|Hassett (pictured left in the late-1930s), scored 137 for Australia. |alt=Two men in cricket uniforms walk along a paved path, wearing white shirts, trousers and shoes.

On the third morning, amid sunshine,<ref name=f93/> Bradman resumed on 130,<ref name="sco1"/> before progressing to 132 and becoming the first player to pass 1,000 runs for the English season.<ref name="report1"/> The Australian captain was not aware of the reason for the spontaneous crowd applause until being notified by wicket-keeper Evans.<ref name=f93/>

Bedser was bowling and he soon implemented O'Reilly's plans. Hutton was moved from [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|leg slip]] to a squarer position at short fine leg, around 11&nbsp;metres from the bat. Two [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|short legs and a mid-on]] were put in place. Bradman drove Bedser through cover for a boundary, but on the next ball, his innings terminated at 138 when he glanced an [[inswinger]] from Bedser straight to Hutton at short fine leg, who caught the ball without having to move.<ref name=f93/> Bradman had batted for 290 minutes and faced 321 balls and as Johnson walked in to replace him with Australia at 305/5,<ref name=sco1/> Bedser waved to O'Reilly in the press box. When former Australian Test opener [[Jack Fingleton]]<U+2014>a teammate of both Bradman and O'Reilly who was also working as a journalist<U+2014>reported what his colleague had done, there was some debate as to whether O'Reilly's actions were treacherous.<ref name=f93/>

Johnson made 21, including an edge over the slips cordon, before being bowled by Laker. He inside edged the ball onto his foot and it rolled back into his stumps.<ref name=f94>Fingleton, p. 94.</ref> At the same time, Yardley pinned Hassett down with more leg theory. Laker bowled with one slip, while Young had none and had all of his fielders evenly spread in a circular formation.<ref name=f94/> Tallon came in and took 39 minutes to compile 10 before hitting a return catch to the [[left-arm orthodox spin]] of Young.<ref name="sco1"/> The scoring was very slow during this passage of play<U+2014>Young delivered 11 consecutive [[over (cricket)|maiden overs]] and his 26-over spell conceded only 14 runs.<ref name="report1"/>

The injured Lindwall came out to bat at 365/7 without a [[runner (cricket)|runner]] to join Hassett.<ref name=sco1/><ref name="report1"/> Hassett, who had scored only 30 runs in the first 75 minutes of the day, swept Laker for four and then hit him for the first [[six (cricket)|six]] of the match. The Australian vice-captain added 53 in the two hours of the morning session to reach lunch at 94. The tourists were unhurried and remained patient as they had bowled England out quickly on the first day and there was still sufficient time to force a result with less than half the playing time elapsed.<ref name=f94/>

After the break, Hassett reached his century after 305 minutes of batting, his first in Tests in England. He then accelerated, adding a further 37 runs in 49 minutes before being bowled by Bedser, having struck 20 fours and a six.<ref name=sco1/><ref name=f95>Fingleton, p. 95.</ref> The dismissal ended an eighth-wicket partnership of 107 with Lindwall, who was caught by Evans down the leg side four runs later,<ref name="report1"/> having scored 42 with seven fours.<ref name=sco1/>
Australia's last-wicket pair of Johnston and Toshack [[List of cricket terms#W|wagged]] a further 33 runs in only 18 minutes before Bedser trapped Toshack to end the innings at 509, leaving the tourists with a 344-run lead.<ref name="sco1"/> Australia had batted for 216.2 overs, the longest innings in terms of overs and the highest total in the series.<ref name="sco1"/><ref name="sco2">{{cite web| title = 2nd Test England v Australia at Lord's Jun 24<U+2013>29 1948|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62686.html|publisher= [[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref><ref name="sco3">{{cite web| title = 3rd Test England v Australia at Manchester Jul 8<U+2013>13 1948|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62687.html|publisher= [[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref><ref name="sco4"/><ref name="sco5">{{cite web| title = 5th Test England v Australia at The Oval Aug 14<U+2013>18 1948|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62689.html|publisher= [[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref> Yardley placed the majority of the bowling load on his [[spin bowling|spinners]]; Young (1/79) and Laker (4/138) delivered 60 and 55 overs respectively. Bedser bowled 44.2 overs, taking 3/113.<ref name="sco1"/><ref name="pol9"/> The part-time [[seam bowling|seam bowlers]], Edrich, Barnett and Yardley, bowled 18, 17 and 17 overs respectively.<ref name=sco1/> Australia had scored slowly but they had no need to take risks when there was so much time remaining. Yardley's leg theory tactics failed to coax them into losing their patience.<ref name=f95/>

England thus started their second innings still 344 runs in arrears.<ref name=sco1/> Although Lindwall was able to run between the wickets, he did not take to the field in the second innings and the 12th man [[Neil Harvey]] took his place. Fingleton said that Harvey was "by far the most brilliant fieldsman of both sides".<ref name=f96>Fingleton, p. 96.</ref> Yardley was sceptical as to whether Lindwall was sufficiently injured to be forced from the field, but did not formally object to Harvey's presence on the field.<ref name=f96/>

Miller removed Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot that was caught by Tallon. The batsman was displeased with the umpire's decision and gestured to a red mark on his shirt, indicating that he felt the ball had touched his body and not the bat.<ref name=f96/> Edrich came in and while he continued to struggle, he defiantly held up his end of the pitch. After scoring 13 from 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson. He did not read the [[arm ball]], which went straight on and took the outside edge, leaving England 39/2.<ref name="sco1"/><ref name="report1"/><ref name=f97>Fingleton, p. 97.</ref>
<!--[[File:Keith Miller bowling, c.1954.jpg|thumb|Miller angered the crowd with his prolific use of bouncers during the English innings.]]-->
This brought together England's leading batsmen, Hutton and Compton. The latter, coming in upon the fall of Edrich, ran down the pitch before the ball was bowled and had to quickly play a defensive shot on the run. He then clipped the next ball to the leg side for two runs before surviving a confident [[leg before wicket]] [[appeal (cricket)|appeal]] from Johnson when he was on eight. Compton appeared ready to walk off, but umpire Chester declined the appeal, much to his surprise. England then reached 50 in 65 minutes and with Lindwall missing, Bradman had difficulties in spreading the workload among his depleted bowling resources. The part-time leg spin of Barnes was brought on as the fifth bowling option to give the others some time to rest, and Miller resumed bowling late in the day, delivering slow [[off spin]] to conserve energy.<ref name=f97/>

Hutton then [[Batting (cricket)#Types of batting shots|leg glanced]] Miller, before [[Batting (cricket)#Types of batting shots|cover driving and square cutting]] him in another over. All three shots went for four and he reached his fifty in 110 minutes. Miller then responded to the spate of boundaries with a series of [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncers]],<ref name=f98>Fingleton, p. 98.</ref> including five in the last over of the day.<ref name="p235"/> One of these struck Hutton high on his left arm. The batsmen survived, but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd throughout his short-pitched barrage, including shouts of "''[[Bodyline]]''".<ref name="report1"/><ref name="p235"/> However, Hutton had the last word, glancing Miller down to fine leg for a four from the final ball of the day. England were 121/2, with Hutton and Compton on 63 and 36 respectively.<ref name="sco1"/><ref name=f98/> Miller was widely jeered and heckled as he walked off the field.<ref name=f98/>

== June 14: Day Four ==

The third day was followed by a rest day on Sunday and play resumed on the fourth morning, a Monday, with England still 223 runs in arrears.<ref name="sco1"/> Before the start of play, the [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club]] (NCCC) secretary, H. A. Brown, broadcast an appeal to the gallery over the public address system to refrain from their heckling of Miller.<ref name="report1"/>
{{quote|Let us keep Nottingham a place where Test matches can continue to be played. On Saturday the Australian, Miller, was booed and there was much subsequent publicity in the press. These Australians are great sportsmen. They stood by the [[British Empire|Empire]] in the war and we should always be pleased to greet them. Let us show them how really pleased we are and give them a warmheated greeting this morning.<ref name=f99/>}}

The crowd responded by clapping as the Australians took to the field. The chairman of the NCCC reportedly apologised to Bradman in private for the crowd reaction to Miller.<ref name=f99>Fingleton, p. 99.</ref>

<!--[[Image:Denis Compton.jpg|thumb|right|Compton resisted Australia for more than a day, scoring 184.]]-->
Hutton and Compton progressed steadily before the light deteriorated. Miller took the new ball in the fifth over of the day, and mindful of recent events, refrained from bouncers during the morning.<ref name=f99/> After half an hour of play, an unsuccessful appeal against the light was made as dark clouds hovered overhead. The rejection of the appeal made little difference, as a thunderstorm stopped proceedings for five minutes soon after.<ref name=f99/> Shortly after the resumption, Miller bowled Hutton with an [[off cutter]] in the dark conditions,<ref name="report1"/> ending the 111-run partnership at 150/3. Hutton had made 74 runs in 168 minutes with 11 fours.<ref name="sco1"/> The wicket prompted the entrance of Hardstaff, and on the third ball he aimed a cut at a wide Miller delivery, and it again went low to [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|second slip]] as in the first innings. However, this time Morris was in the position and the catch was dropped. It was part of an eventful over during which Hardstaff had many near-misses. He played and missed at one ball, inside edged another into his pads and then edged a ball through the slips for two runs.<ref name=f100>Fingleton, p. 100.</ref>

At 12:35, bad light stopped proceedings, and after two inspections the umpires resumed play.<ref name=f100/> Hardstaff then batted aggressively, hitting three drives for four from Miller and Johnston, in one period in which he outscored Compton 23 to four. He then edged through slips for another boundary before Compton swept Toshack to the fence. In the final over before the lunch break, Hardstaff [[Batting (cricket)#Types of batting shots|square drove]] Johnston for four off the back foot and England adjourned at 191/3 with Compton on 63 and Hardstaff 31, still 153 in arrears.<ref name=f101>Fingleton, p. 101.</ref>

After lunch, the light was again poor, but England did not appeal to the umpires for an adjournment. Yardley wanted to bat now in poor visibility in order to eradicate the deficit and build a lead, so that if a shower came later and turned the pitch into a [[sticky wicket]], Australia would have to chase a target on an erratic surface.<ref name=f101/> Bradman anticipated rain, so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensively to slow England's progress in the hope that the hosts would not have a lead by the time a sticky wicket materialised.<ref name=f101/> Hardstaff brought up England's 200 with a strongly-hit hook that almost hit Barnes.<ref name=f101/> Compton then hit a boundary from Toshack, prompting Bradman to further stack the leg side with fielders in defensive positions. Scoring was slow as Toshack pinned down the batsmen with an effective leg stump line.<ref name=f101/>

The innings was then interrupted by bad light and upon the resumption of proceedings, poor visibility intervened for a second time with Compton on 97. After 55 minutes of delay, the umpires called the players back onto the field. ''Wisden'' opined that "rarely can a Test Match have been played under such appalling conditions as on this day."<ref name="report1"/> Fingleton said the conditions were "pitiable" and lamented the "utmost gloom in which batsmen and fieldsmen had intense difficulty in sighting the ball".<ref name=f103>Fingleton, p. 103.</ref> Compton brought up his third consecutive century at Trent Bridge, a "lovely century of stroke-play and patience" according to Fingleton.<ref name=f102>Fingleton, p. 102.</ref> The innings had taken 227 minutes and included 12 fours.<ref name=f102/>

Soon after, Compton edged to the slips from the bowling of Miller, but Johnson spilled the catch. Hardstaff then fell for 43, lofting Toshack to Hassett on the leg side, having put on 93 with Compton.<ref name=sco1/><ref name=f102/> Barnett came in and together with Compton added 21 runs in 33 minutes before edging Johnston to Miller, who completed a difficult catch in slips.<ref name=sco1/><ref name=f102/> Yardley came out to bat at 264/5 and Compton drove Miller square for four, provoking the bowler's first bouncer of the day. Compton hooked it away for two and Miller's next delivery slipped out of his hand and cleared Compton's head on the full to some jeering in the crowd.<ref name=sco1/><ref name=f102/> Such a ball is known as a [[beamer (cricket)|beamer]] and is illegal because of the physical danger it poses to the batsman. Compton and Yardley put on a 57-run partnership in 66 minutes before Johnston held a return catch to dismiss Yardley for 22.<ref name="sco1"/><ref name="report1"/> England [[Stumps#End_of_the_day's_play|reached stumps]] at 345/6, just one run ahead of Australia, with Compton on 154 and Evans on 10.<ref name="sco1"/>

== June 15: Day Five ==

Compton and Evans continued to resist the Australians on the final morning, which was briefly interrupted by rain less than 30 minutes after the start of play. At the time, it appeared that the downpour might cause the match to end in a draw.<ref name=f104>Fingleton, p. 104.</ref> After half an hour of stoppages, play resumed and Evans attacked, hitting two fours in quick succession. England had added a further 60 runs to reach 405/6.<ref name=f104/>

Miller bowled a fast bouncer at Compton, who moved into position to hook before changing his mind and attempting to evade the ball. He lost balance and threw his legs apart, trying to avoid stepping onto his stumps. However, he was unsuccessful and was out [[hit wicket]] for 184,<ref name="report1"/> having batted for 413 minutes and hit 19 fours.<ref name="sco1"/> ''Wisden'' opined that "No praise could be too high for the manner in which Compton carried the side's responsibilities and defied a first-class attack in such trying circumstances."<ref name="report1"/> Fingleton said it was "a most depressing end to an innings that will live always".<ref name=f104/> Compton's fall at 405/7 exposed the English [[List of cricket terms#T|tail]] and Australia quickly finished off the rest of the batsmen in 36 minutes. Miller bowled Laker for four, Evans reached 50 and was caught behind from Johnston, who then [[bowled|castled]] Young for nine. England were all out for 441 after 183 overs, leaving Australia a target of 98 in three hours.<ref name="sco1"/><ref name=f104/> Lindwall's absence throughout the England innings meant that the remaining four Australian frontline bowlers had bowled more than 32 overs each<U+2014>Johnston delivered 59 and ended with 4/147 while Miller took 4/125 from 44 overs. Toshack and Johnson took a wicket each from 33 and 42 overs respectively.<ref name="sco1"/>

[[File:Sid Barnes, 16 Petersham.jpg|thumb|Barnes, pictured here in a photo at the age of 16, top-scored as Australia reached their target. |alt=A teenage boy leans over his bat, in front of the stumps, in readiness to face a ball. He is wearing a white shirt, trousers and a cap]]

Australia progressed quickly at the start of the chase. Barnes took 13 runs from the opening over, bowled by Bedser, while Morris again lacked fluency. The tourists proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Bedser bowled Morris for nine.<ref name=f105>Fingleton, p. 105.</ref> Bradman came to the crease and batted for 12 minutes without getting off the mark. From the 10th ball that he faced, the Australian skipper was out for a duck, again caught by Hutton at short fine leg in Bedser's leg trap.<ref name="report1"/> Bradman's dismissal left Australia at 48/2. However, Hassett joined Barnes and they reached the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes ended on 64 with 11 boundaries, having been prolific on the [[Batting (cricket)#Types of batting shots|square cut]]. He tied the scores with a swept boundary, and having taken a stump as souvenir, ran off the ground believing that the match was over. Barnes returned to the field after noticing the reaction of the amused crowd and Hassett promptly hit the winning run.<ref name="sco1">{{cite web| title = 1st Test England v Australia at Nottingham Jun 10<U+2013>15 1948|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62685.html|publisher= [[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref><ref name="report1"/><ref name=f105/>

{{seealso|Second Test, 1948 Ashes series|Third Test, 1948 Ashes series |Fourth Test, 1948 Ashes series|Fifth Test, 1948 Ashes series}}

The First Test was a continuation of the trend of English batsmen being largely unable to cope with Australia's pacemen. Hutton was the only Englishman to pass 50 in the MCC match, and at Trent Bridge only he and Compton managed this feat. Apart from Hardstaff, none of the remaining batsmen passed 25.<ref name=mcc/><ref name=sco1/> ''Wisden's'' verdict was that England fought back very well, but that avoiding defeat was almost impossible after their poor batting on the first day.<ref name="report1"/> Bowes considered the defensive English bowling display worthy of a draw, but that the first innings batting let the side down. However, he believed that the English tactics were justified and should have been continued.<ref>Bowes, pp. 188&ndash;89.</ref>

Australia's success came at a cost, with Lindwall injured and unable to bowl in the lead-up to the Second Test, missing the intervening matches against [[Northamptonshire CCC|Northamptonshire]] and [[Yorkshire CCC|Yorkshire]].<ref name=northants>{{cite web

|accessdate = 2008-12-18}}</ref> The heavy workload on Miller caused by Lindwall's breaking down mid-Test generated severe back pain, and he was still not fully recovered by the start of the Second Test at [[Lord's]]. Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning of the Lord's Test. Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations were sufficient to convince his captain to risk his inclusion.<ref name="p233"/> Australia won the toss and elected to bat,<ref name="sco2"/> allowing Lindwall further time to recover from his injury.<ref name="p233">Perry (2001), p. 233.</ref> Miller also played, but still nursing his back, was unfit to bowl.<ref name="p239">Perry (2005), p. 239.</ref>

Content with their convincing win at Trent Bridge, Australia made no changes to their team, while England made three, omitting Barnett, Hardstaff and Young due to a combination of injury and poor form.<ref name=sco1/><ref name=sco2/> Barnett and Hardstaff never played another Test. Despite his injury, Lindwall played a key role in a heavy 409-run Australian victory, taking eight wickets.<ref name=sco2/> His bowling also led to the controversial omission of Hutton, who performed poorly at Lord's, for the Third Test. The reason was said to be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling.<ref name="p224">Perry (2001), p. 224.</ref> This decision pleased the Australians, who felt that Hutton was their most formidable opponent with the bat.<ref name="p224"/>

On the field, the Australians continued to flourish. The Third Test was a rain-affected draw, and between the First and Fourth Tests, they won four of their five county matches, drawing the other.<ref name=sched/> On the final day of the Fourth Test, Australia's batsmen set a world Test cricket record by scoring 404 to win the match, thereby taking a series-winning 3<U+2013>0 lead.<ref name=sco4>{{cite web| title = 4th Test England v Australia at Leeds Jul 22<U+2013>27 1948|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62688.html|publisher= [[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref><ref name=report4>{{Cite web|title= Fourth Test Match England v Australia |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949 |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152897.html |accessdate=2008-07-02 |publisher=[[Wisden]]}}</ref>

After the historic win in the Fourth Test, Australia had five tour matches before the final Test.
