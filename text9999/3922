'''State Route 234''' ('''SR&nbsp;234''') is a west-east [[state highway#United States|state highway]] located in the [[Southwest Georgia|southwestern part]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. It runs for approximately {{convert|28.3|mi|km}} through portions of [[Calhoun County, Georgia|Calhoun]] and [[Dougherty County, Georgia|Dougherty]] counties.

==Route description==
SR&nbsp;234 begins at an [[intersection (road)|intersection]] with [[Georgia State Route 45|SR&nbsp;45]] northeast of [[Morgan, Georgia|Morgan]] in Calhoun County. The route runs east, passing Calhoun County Road 45 (Lizard Lope Road, which leads to Conley Cemetery), Calhoun CR&nbsp;136 (Wildemeade Road), and Calhoun CR&nbsp;119, before it reaches an intersection with [[Georgia State Route 55|SR&nbsp;55]], northeast of [[Leary, Georgia|Leary]]. Shortly after SR&nbsp;55, the route crosses into Dougherty County. Farther to the east, SR&nbsp;234 intersects Tallahassee Road, which leads to [[Sasser, Georgia|Sasser]]. Just before entering [[Albany, Georgia|Albany]], the road passes Live Oak Elementary School. In downtown Albany, it passes [[Darton State College]]. Farther in, it has a very brief [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with [[U.S. Route 19 Business (Albany, Georgia)|US&nbsp;19 Business]]/[[U.S. Route 82 Business (Albany, Georgia)|US&nbsp;82 Business]]/[[Georgia State Route 520 Business|SR&nbsp;520 Business]]. Then, it passes [[Albany Technical College]] just before intersections with [[Georgia State Route 62|SR&nbsp;62]] (Slappey Boulevard) and [[Georgia State Route 91|SR&nbsp;91]] (Newton Road). SR&nbsp;91 leads to [[Southwest Georgia Regional Airport]]. On the eastern edge of Albany it meets its eastern terminus, an [[interchange (road)|interchange]] with [[U.S. Route 19 in Georgia|US&nbsp;19]]/[[Georgia State Route 3|SR&nbsp;3]]/[[Georgia State Route 133|SR&nbsp;133]]/[[Georgia State Route 300|SR&nbsp;300]]. Here, US&nbsp;19/SR&nbsp;3/SR&nbsp;300, as well as SR&nbsp;133 north, are known as Liberty Expressway, while SR&nbsp;133 south continues the roadway of SR&nbsp;234 along Moultrie Road.<ref name="Google"/>

No section of SR&nbsp;234 is part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]], a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility and defense.<ref name="NHS Georgia">{{cite web|title=National Highway System: Georgia|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/georgia/georgia_ga.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=United States Department of Transportation|date=May 8, 2009|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref>

==History==
{{Expand section|date=February 2013}}
SR&nbsp;234 was established, and paved, in 1946 along the same alignment as it runs today.<ref name="GDOT 1945"/><ref name="GDOT 1946"/><!-- In downtown Albany, the route was originally known as [[Georgia State Route 91W|State Route 91W]], which was decommissioned in the late 1970s, while SR&nbsp;62 took over the southern end of Slappey Boulevard near Albany Technical College. However, in 2007, SR&nbsp;62 was decommissioned east of SR&nbsp;234.-->
