'''Pierre Pr<U+00FC>m''' (9 July 1886 - 1 February 1950) was a [[Luxembourg]]ian [[politician]] and [[jurist]].  He was the fourteenth [[Prime Minister of Luxembourg]], serving for a year, from [[20 March]] [[1925]] until [[16 July]] [[1926]].

==Early life==
Pr<U+00FC>m was born in [[Troisvierges]], in the far north of the Grand Duchy, on [[9 July]] [[1886]].  His father, [[Emile Pr<U+00FC>m]], was a fervent [[Roman Catholic]] and a prominent [[conservatism|conservative]] politician, and this greatly affected his political outlook.  He and his brother Emmanuel were sent to university at [[Catholic University of Leuven|Leuven]], where he joined [[K.A.V. Lovania Leuven]], a Catholic [[Studentenverbindung|fraternity]].

While his brother became a [[priest]], Pierre trained as a [[lawyer]].  Like his father, he sought political office, and entered politics himself, representing the [[Cantons of Luxembourg|canton]] of [[Clervaux (canton)|Clervaux]] in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]].<ref name="Thewes 2003, p.91">Thewes (2003), p.91</ref>  As a conservative, he joined the [[Party of the Right (Luxembourg)|Party of the Right]] (PD) when it was founded, in 1914.  However, Pr<U+00FC>m left the Party of the Right in 1918 to form his own party, the [[Independent National Party (Luxembourg)|Independent National Party]] (PNI).<ref name="Thewes 2003, p.91"/>

==Government==
In 1925, the PNI seized upon the inability of the PD government to pass [[railway]] reforms.<ref name="Thewes 2003, p.88">Thewes (2003), p.88</ref>  In the [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 1925|legislative elections]] of the [[1 March]], the ruling Party of the Right lost its [[majority]] in the Chamber of Deputies, winning only 22 of the 47 seats.<ref name="Thewes 2003, p.88"/>  Unwilling to form a coalition with any parties that had blocked its railway reforms, Pr<U+00FC>m was invited to form a government, provided that he could form a majority coalition.  Taking in an eclectic collection of [[Radical Socialist Party (Luxembourg)|Radical Socialists]] and dissident conservatives, with the additional informal backing of the [[Socialist Party (Luxembourg)|Socialist Party]], Pr<U+00FC>m's government took office on [[20 March]].<ref name="Thewes 2003, p.88"/>

Pr<U+00FC>m sought to improve relations with [[France]] and [[Germany]], which had been alienated by the formation of the [[Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union]] in 1921.  On [[9 October]], Pr<U+00FC>m negotiated a working arrangement on the coordination of iron production in France and Luxembourg.<ref name="Thewes 2003, p.89">Thewes (2003), p.89</ref>  At the same time, the [[Locarno Treaties]] were signed between seven European states (not including Luxembourg); the treaties confirmed the inviolability of the borders redrawn by the [[Treaty of Versailles]].  These two arrangements would go a considerable distance towards calming the tensions over Luxembourg that had flared up during and after the [[First World War]].<ref name="Thewes 2003, p.89"/>

When the government turned its attention back to domestic affairs, it did not fare so well.  The Socialist Party had supported Pr<U+00FC>m throughout 1925, despite not being rewarded with a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] position.  As a mark of its debt to the Socialists, in May 1926, the government sought to introduce a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] improving [[working conditions]].<ref name="Thewes 2003, p.90">Thewes (2003), p.90</ref>  The Liberals, who predominantly represented [[employer]]s and the [[professional class]], were angered, and withdrew their support for the government.  Without a majority, Pr<U+00FC>m tendered his resignation to [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duchess]] [[Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg|Charlotte]] on [[22 June]].<ref name="Thewes 2003, p.90"/>
