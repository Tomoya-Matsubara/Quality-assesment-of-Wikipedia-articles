'''''On Your Way, Riley''''' is a 1982 play by [[Alan Plater]] and a 1985 [[Yorkshire Television]] drama of the same name about the private and theatrical partnership of husband and wife '[[Old Mother Riley]]' [[music hall]] performers [[Arthur Lucan]] and [[Kitty McShane]].

With songs by [[Alex Glasgow]],  the musical play ''On Your Way, Riley!'' premiered at the [[Theatre Royal Stratford East]]<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/theatre-obituaries/7854807/Alan-Plater.html Alan Plater's obituary in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' 25 June 2010]</ref> in April 1982.<ref>[http://www.kent.ac.uk/library/specialcollections/theatre/r.php/36049/show.html ''On Your Way, Riley'' in the [[University of Kent]] Theatre Collection]</ref> The original cast included [[Geoffrey Freshwater]] and [[Robert Daws]], with [[Brian Murphy (actor)|Brian Murphy]] and [[Maureen Lipman]] as Lucan and McShane. The play was directed by Philip Hedley<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0686786/otherworks Alan Plater on the [[Internet Movie Database]]].</ref> A 1983 tour of the play had [[John Halstead (actor)|John Halstead]] and [[Yvonne Edgell]] in the leading roles. 

The play was adapted for television, without the songs, as ''On Your Way, Riley'', and was broadcast on [[ITV]] on 2 January 1985, again with Brian Murphy and Maureen Lipman as Lucan and McShane. The play was based on the deteriorating marital relationship between the two main characters, with Lucan expressing his feelings about his wife's many infidelities. This was paralleled with their on-stage personas, where [[Old Mother Riley]] (Lucan) is concerned about the whereabouts of her daughter Kitty (McShane) in the evenings, and who she is seeing. The 70 minute TV drama was directed by [[John Glenister]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1339338 ''On Your Way, Riley'' at the IMDb]</ref>
