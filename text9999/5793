In the [[U.S. state]] of [[Colorado]], '''[[Interstate 70]]''' is an [[Interstate Highway]] traversing an east-west route across the center of the state. The highway connects the metropolitan areas of [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] and [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]] via a route through the [[Rocky Mountains]].  The Colorado portion of I-70 is noted for the [[Eisenhower Tunnel]] which is the highest vehicular tunnel in the world and the highest point along the [[Interstate Highway System]].<ref name=funfacts>{{cite web

I-70's construction is equally noted as an engineering marvel and unintentionally became a major event in the [[Women's Liberation Movement]]<ref name=rambler/>. The Colorado portion of I-70 was built parallel to [[U.S. Route 40]] east of [[Idaho Springs, Colorado]]. West of Idaho Springs I-70 was built along the corridor of a road that was numbered [[U.S. Route 6]] at the time of I-70's construction.

[[Image:Colorado05.JPG|thumb|right|I-70 inside [[Glenwood Canyon]] paralleling the [[Colorado River]] and [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]] main line, now operated by the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] ]]
===Grand Valley===
I-70 enters Colorado from Utah following at first Rabbit Valley and then [[Grand Valley (Colorado)|Grand Valley]]. Both valleys are just south of the [[Book Cliffs]] and formed by the [[Colorado River]] or its tributaries. The freeway then serves [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]] the  largest city along the [[Colorado Western Slope|Western Slope]] and the economic capital of western Colorado and eastern Utah. The freeway passes to the north of downtown.
 
===Western Slope===
The highway exits the Grand Valley and continues to use the Colorado River as its path up the [[Colorado Western Slope|Western Slope]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The first canyon of the Colorado is [[De Beque Canyon]]. This is also where the first pair of several [[tunnel]]s is used to aid I-70 over the Rockies.<ref name=DeLORME1>{{cite map

The highway then enters [[Glenwood Canyon]], considered one of the most scenic features of the [[Interstate Highway System]] and one of the most expensive roads per mile to build in the Interstate System. The freeway usually hugs the north bank of the [[Colorado River]] with the [[railroad|Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]] occupying the south bank. In the canyon the freeway passes through 2.5 pairs of tunnels, two tunnels driving east and three tunnels driving west.<ref name=googletunnels>{{cite web

The highway departs the the Colorado River near the railroad junction of [[Dotsero, Colorado|Dotsero]] and follows the [[Eagle River (Colorado)|Eagle River]] for its path towards [[Vail, Colorado|Vail]] and [[Vail Pass]] at an elevation of {{convert|10666|ft|m|0}}.<ref name=DeLORME2>{{cite map

At {{convert|11158|ft|m}} this is the highest point along the [[Interstate Highway System]] and the longest tunnel built under the Interstate Highway program.<ref name=Cdoteisenhower>{{cite web|url = http://www.dot.state.co.us/Eisenhower/description.asp|title=Eisenhower Tunnel|publisher= Colorado Department of Transportation}}</ref> The tunnel was originally called the straight creek after the creek used for the western approach.<ref name=Cdoteisenhower/>

The freeway uses [[Clear Creek (Colorado)|Clear Creek]] for its path down the eastern side of the Rockies. Along the way, the highway passes through one more set of tunnels near [[Idaho Springs, Colorado|Idaho Springs]].  The last portion of the Rocky Mountains traversed as the highway enters Denver is frequently called the [[Hogback (geology)|Hogback]].

===Front Range===
[[Image:2006-03-26 Denver Skyline I-25 Speer.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown Denver near the [[Mousetrap (Denver)|Mousetrap]] ]]
I-70 then enters the [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] metropolitan area, also frequently called the [[Front Range]].  The Front Range is also refers to the last portion of the Rocky Mountains, and the beginning of the [[Great Plains]]. The freeway is routed to the north of the [[LoDo]] district, the common name of the [[downtown]] area of Denver. Here it meets [[Interstate 25]] in an intersection frequently called the [[Mousetrap (Denver)|Mousetrap]]. The highway then passes by the former site of [[Stapleton International Airport]] and then proceeds east out of Denver

===Great Plains===
East of [[Aurora, Colorado|Aurora]] I-70 joins the alignment of [[Colfax Avenue]]. This street serves as the main street of Denver, and is still the alignment of [[U.S. Route 40]] through downtown Denver. From this point east the freeway, now joined with US 40 proceeds due east  across the [[Great Plains]]. The freeway dips south to serve the city of [[Limon, Colorado|Limon]] then continues due east. The highway enters Kansas due east of [[Burlington, Colorado|Burlington]].

==History==
[[Image:Colorado02.JPG|thumb|left|I-70 crossing the [[Rocky Mountains]] ]]
===Earlier routes===
The path of I-70 in Colorado is derived from two previous highways, [[U.S. Route 6]] and [[U.S. Route 40]]. US 40 was an original piece of the [[U.S. Highway]] system commissioned in 1926. The portion now numbered [[U.S. Route 6]] came about in 1937 when the route over [[Vail Pass]] was paved. A portion of this route was also numbered [[U.S. Route 24]] at the time.<ref name=dalesanderson>{{cite web

|title = U.S. Highway ends in Grand Junction, Colorado
|author = Dale Sanderson

===Interstate Highway planning===
As first proposed the western terminus of I-70 was [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], using the corridor of [[U.S. Route 40]] as the base for the new freeway.<ref name=rambler/>  Colorado [[governor]] [[Edwin C. Johnson]] was a primary force in persuading the planners of the [[Interstate Highway System]] to extend the highway to traverse the entire state. He stated to the senate subcommittee:

<blockquote>You are going to have a four-lane highway through Wyoming. You are going to build two four-lane highways through New Mexico and Arizona. Colorado needs to be able to compete with our neighboring States. We do not want to take anything away from them. We do not want them to get way out ahead of us, either, because these interstate highways are going to be very attractive highways for the East and West to travel on.<ref name=rambler/></blockquote>

He was able to convince officials in Utah that they would benefit by having a direct freeway link between Denver and [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]]. In honor of his efforts the westbound bore of the [[Eisenhower Tunnel]] is named after him.

There was some debate on which corridor would be used to extend the freeway to [[Utah]].<ref name=rambler/> The three proposals were to use the routes of [[U.S. Route 40]], which crests the [[Continental Divide]] via [[Berthoud Pass]], or [[U.S. Route 6]] which crests at [[Loveland Pass]], or [[U.S. Route 24]] at [[Tennessee Pass (Colorado)|Tennessee Pass]]<ref name=DeLORME2/>. It was soon decided that the US 6 corridor was the most practical of the alternatives, but regardless it was impractical to built a road across the Continental Divide in Colorado that conformed to [[Interstate Highway standards]].

===Eisenhower Tunnel===
[[Image:Interstate 70 in Colorado Flats.jpg|thumb|right|I-70 crossing the [[Great Plains]] in Colorado]]
The decision was made to [[tunnel]] underneath the continental divide. Several alternatives were considered before deciding on using Straight Creek as the corridor for this tunnel. It was originally called the Straight Creek Tunnel but renamed the [[Eisenhower-Johnson Memorial Tunnel]], after President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Governor [[Edwin C. Johnson]]. 

Construction on the first bore of the tunnel was started on March 15, 1968.<ref name=Cdoteisenhower/> Construction efforts suffered many setbacks and the project went well over time and budget. The frustration prompted one [[engineer]] to comment in frustration, "We were going by the book, but the damned mountain couldn't read."<ref name=Cdoteisenhower/> One of the biggest setbacks was the discovery of [[fault lines]] in the path of the tunnel that were not discovered during the [[pilot bore]]s<ref name=Cdoteisenhower/>. Thought the project was supposed to take 3 years, the tunnel was not opened to traffic until March 8, 1973. Initially this tunnel (the Eisenhower bore) was used for 2 way traffic with one way in each direction. The amount of traffic through the tunnel exceeded predictions and efforts soon begin to expedite construction on the second bore (Johnson bore).Construction began on the second tunnel on August 18, 1975 and finished on December 21, 1979.<ref name=Cdoteisenhower/>

The tunnel construction became unintentionally involved in the [[Women's Liberation Movement]] when Janet Bonneman applied for work with the Colorado Department of Transportation. She was given a position in the construction of the Straight Creek tunnels project. However, after 18 months on the job she had still not entered the tunnel, instead doing support work from the office. There was opposition to a woman entering the construction site with one supervisor stating if she entered, "Those workers would flat walk out of that there tunnel and they'd never come back."<ref name=rambler/> Emboldened by the passage of a equal rights law in Colorado, she finally entered the tunnel on November 9, 1972. Several workers did walk off the job, but most returned the next day. She remained determined, and returned to work the next day, and even did work on the roof of the tunnel overlooking the men below.<ref name=rambler/>

===Glenwood Canyon===
[[Image:CZglenwood.jpg|thumb|left|I-70 in [[Glenwood Canyon]] as seen from the [[California Zephyr]] ]]
With the tunnels open for traffic, the last remaining obstacle for I-70 to be an interstate commerce artery was the two lane portion in Glenwood Canyon. Construction had started on this portion in the 1960's but was stopped due to [[environmentalist]] protests that caused a 30 year controversy<ref name=rambler/>. The final design attempted to minimize environmental impacts and involved 40 bridges and viaducts, three tunnels (not counting 2 that were built before construction was stopped in the 1960's) and {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} of retaining wall.<ref name=weingroff/><ref name=funfacts/>. The freeway was finally complete in October 1992. Many people consider this to be the last piece of the Interstate Highway System to open, although gaps still exist in [[Interstate 95]] and  [[Breezewood, Pennsylvania]].
