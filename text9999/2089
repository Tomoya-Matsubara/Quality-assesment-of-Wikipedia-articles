'''<U+00D3>engus son of Fergus''' ([[Pictish language|Hypothetical Pictish form]]: ''Onuist map Urguist'';<ref>Forsyth discusses the various forms of <U+00D3>engus's name, also providing ''Ungus(t)'' as an alternative Pictish form.</ref> [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]]: ''<U+00D3>engus mac Fergusso'',  Anglicisation: ''Angus mac Fergus''), was [[king of the Picts]] from 732 until his death in 761. His reign can be reconstructed in some detail from a variety of sources.

<U+00D3>engus became the chief king in Pictland following a period of civil war in the late 720s. During his reign, the neighbouring kingdom of [[D<U+00E1>l Riata]] was subjugated and the [[kingdom of Strathclyde]] was attacked with less success. The most powerful ruler in [[Scotland]] for over two decades, he was involved in wars in [[Ireland]] and [[England]]. Kings from <U+00D3>engus's family dominated Pictland until 839 when a disastrous defeat at the hands of [[Vikings]] began a new period of instability, which ended with the coming to power of [[Kenneth I of Scotland|Cin<U+00E1>ed mac Ailp<U+00ED>n]].

==Sources and background==
Surviving Pictish sources for the period are few, limited to king lists, the original of which was prepared in the early 720s,<ref>M. O Anderson, ''Kings and Kingship'', pp. 88&ndash;102.</ref> and a number of accounts relating to the foundation of [[St Andrews]], then called Cennr<U+00ED>gmonaid. Beyond Pictland, the principal sources are the [[Irish annals]], of which the ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'' and the ''[[Annals of Tigernach]]'' are the most reliable. These include materials from an annal kept at the monastery of [[Iona]] in Scotland. <U+00D3>engus and the Picts appear occasionally in [[Wales|Welsh]] sources, such as the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'', and more frequently in [[Northumbria]]n sources, of which the Continuation of [[Bede]]'s chronicle and the ''Historia Regum Anglorum'' attributed to [[Symeon of Durham]] are the most important.<ref>Most sources are collected in ''Early Sources of Scottish History'' (''ESSH'') and ''Scottish Annals from English Chroniclers'' (''SAEC''), edited by [[Alan Orr Anderson]].</ref>

[[Image:Onuist map.png|thumb|right|180px|Selected political groups in Northern Britain around 740 AD.]]

The [[Picts]] were one of four political groups in north [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the early 8th century. Pictland ran from the [[River Forth]] northwards, including [[Orkney]], [[Shetland]] and the [[Western Isles]]. Prior to the [[Viking Age]], the main power in Pictland appears to have been the kingdom of [[Fortriu]]. Known high-status sites in Fortriu include [[Burghead]] and Craig Ph<U+00E1>draig by [[Inverness]]. Pictland appears to have had only one bishop with his seat at [[Rosemarkie]].<ref>Early 8th century bishops include [[Curet<U+00E1>n]], [[Fergustus Pictus|Fergus]] and Brecc. Anderson, ''ESSH'', pp. 221; Yorke, ''Conversion'', pp. 153<U+2013>155. Surveys of North Britain can be found in D.W. Harding, ''The Iron Age in Northern Britain: Celts and Romans, Natives and Invaders'' (2004), and Leslie Alcock, ''Kings & Warriors, Craftsmen & Priests in Northern Britain AD 550&ndash;850'' (2003). Foster, ''Picts, Gaels and Scots'' (2005), excludes southern Scotland and northern England.</ref>

From the Forth south to the [[River Humber]] lay the kingdom of [[Northumbria]]. Once the dominant force in Britain, it remained a powerful kingdom, but the end of the old dynasty of kings with the death of [[Osric of Northumbria|Osric]] in 729 led to conflict between rival families for the throne. The growing power of the [[Mercia]]n kingdom to the south added to the problems faced by Northumbrian kings. For most of <U+00D3>engus's reign Northumbria was ruled by the capable King [[Eadberht of Northumbria|Eadberht Eating]].<ref>Surveys of Northumbria include David Rollason's ''Northumbria, 500<U+2013>1100: Creation and Destruction of a Kingdom'' (2003), and Nick Higham's ''The Kingdom of Northumbria AD 350<U+2013>1100'' (1993).</ref>

To the south-west of Pictland were the [[Gaels]] of [[D<U+00E1>l Riata]] where the kingship was disputed between the [[Cen<U+00E9>l Loairn]] of northern [[Argyll]] and the [[Cen<U+00E9>l nGabr<U+00E1>in]] of [[Kintyre]]. In 723 [[Selbach mac Ferchair]] abdicated as head of the Cen<U+00E9>l Loairn and king of D<U+00E1>l Riata in favour of his son [[D<U+00FA>ngal mac Selbaig|D<U+00FA>ngal]], who was driven out as king of D<U+00E1>l Riata by [[Eochaid mac Echdach]] of the Cen<U+00E9>l nGabr<U+00E1>in in 726. D<U+00FA>ngal and Eochaid were still in conflict as late as 731, when D<U+00FA>ngal burnt [[Tarbert, Argyll and Bute|Tarbert]].<ref>John Bannerman, ''Studies in the History of Dalriada'' (1974), remains the standard work on D<U+00E1>l Riata.</ref>

The history of the fourth group, the [[Brythons|Britons]] of [[Alt Clut]], later the kingdom of Strathclyde, leaves little trace in the record. King [[Teudebur of Alt Clut|Teudebur map Beli]] had ruled from [[Dumbarton Rock]] since 722, and continued to do so until his death in 752 when his son [[Dumnagual III of Alt Clut|Dumnagual]] succeeded him.<ref>Anderson, ''ESSH'', pp. 240&ndash;241 & 243. "Rotri, king of the Britons", whose death is recorded in the ''Annales Cambriae'' s.a. 754, has sometimes been identified as a king of Alt Clut, but this notice refers to [[Rhodri Molwynog ap Idwal]], [[King of Gwynedd]].</ref>

==Rise to power==
Irish genealogies make <U+00D3>engus a member of the [[E<U+00F3>ganachta]] of [[Munster]], as a descendant of Coirpre Cruthnech<U+00E1>n or "Cairbre the little Pict", a mythological emanation or double of [[Coirpre Luachra mac Cuirc]],<ref>[[Francis John Byrne]], ''Irish Kings and High-Kings''. [[Four Courts Press]]. 2nd revised edition, 2001. pp. 193-4, 291</ref> legendary son of [[Conall Corc]],<ref>An early cycle of tales have Conall Corc traveling to Pictland, and there taking the daughter of the Pictish king as his first wife, hence Coirpre's epithet. In any case, contacts between Scotland and distant Munster are known from the earliest times. The early D<U+00E1>l Riata were said to have lived in West Munster (Iarmuman) before migrating to Ulster and western Scotland.</ref> and ancestor of the [[E<U+00F3>ganacht Locha L<U+00E9>in]], rulers of the kingdom of [[Iarmuman]].  The branch of the kindred from which he came were said located in an area known as Circinn, usually associated with modern [[Angus]] and the [[Mearns]].<ref>Forsyth, "Evidence of a lost Pictish source", pp. 27<U+2013>28. The genealogy appears in the Rawlinson B 502 manuscript, &para;1083.</ref> His early life is unknown; <U+00D3>engus was middle-aged by the time he entered into history.<ref>Woolf, "Carnifex tyrannus", p. 36.</ref> His close kin included at least two sons, Bridei (died 736) and [[Talorgan II of the Picts|Talorgan]] (died 782), and two brothers, Talorgan (died 750) and [[Bridei V of the Picts|Bridei]] (died 763).<ref>Yorke, ''Conversion'', pp. 49<U+2013>50, 54 & 288<U+2013>289 discusses the reconstructed relationship between late Pictish kings. Talorgan is a [[hypocoristic]] form of Talorg; Anderson, ''ESSH'', p. 253, note 2.</ref>

King [[Nechtan IV of the Picts|Nechtan son of Der-Ile]] abdicated to enter a monastery in 724 and was imprisoned by his successor [[Drest VII of the Picts|Drest]] in 726. In 728 and 729, four kings competed for power in Pictland: Drest; Nechtan; [[Alp<U+00ED>n I of the Picts|Alp<U+00ED>n]], of whom little is known; and lastly <U+00D3>engus, who was a partisan of Nechtan, and perhaps his acknowledged heir.<ref>For reports of events from 724 to 729, see Anderson, ''ESSH'', pp. 221<U+2013>227. For <U+00D3>engus as Nechtan's supporter, Henderson, pp. 155<U+2013>156; Woolf, "Carnifex tyrannus", p.36.</ref>

Four battles large enough to be recorded in Ireland were fought in 728 and 729. Alp<U+00ED>n was defeated twice by <U+00D3>engus, after which Nechtan was restored to power. In 729 a battle between supporters of <U+00D3>engus and Nechtan's enemies was fought at Monith Carno (traditionally Cairn o' Mount, near [[Fettercairn]]) where the supporters of <U+00D3>engus were victorious. Nechtan was restored to the kingship, probably until his death in 732.<ref>Woolf, "AU 729.2".</ref> On 12 August 729 <U+00D3>engus defeated and killed Drest in battle at Druimm Derg Blathuug, a place which has not been identified.

==Percutio Dal Riatai==
[[Image:Dalriada.png|right|thumb|200px|Satellite image of northern [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] showing the approximate area of D<U+00E1>l Riata (shaded).]]

In the 730s, <U+00D3>engus fought against [[D<U+00E1>l Riata]] whose traditional overlords and protectors in Ireland, the [[Cen<U+00E9>l Conaill]], were much weakened at this time. A fleet from D<U+00E1>l Riata fought for [[Flaithbertach mac Loingsig]], chief of the Cen<U+00E9>l Conaill, in his war with [[<U+00C1>ed All<U+00E1>n]] of the [[Cen<U+00E9>l nE<U+00F3>gan]], and suffered heavy losses in 733.<ref>Woolf, "Carnifex tyrannus", p. 36; Anderson, ''ESSH'', pp. 229<U+2013>230.</ref> D<U+00E1>l Riata was ruled by [[Eochaid mac Echdach]] of the [[Cen<U+00E9>l nGabr<U+00E1>in]] who died in 733, and the king lists are unclear as to who, if anyone, succeeded him as overking. The [[Cen<U+00E9>l Loairn]] of north [[Argyll]] were ruled by [[D<U+00FA>ngal mac Selbaig]] whom Eochaid had deposed as overking of D<U+00E1>l Riata in the 720s.

Fighting between the Picts, led by <U+00D3>engus's son Bridei, and the D<U+00E1>l Riata, led by Talorgan mac Congussa, is recorded in 731. In 733, D<U+00FA>ngal mac Selbaig "profaned [the sanctuary] of [[Tory Island]] when he dragged Bridei out of it." D<U+00FA>ngal, previously deposed as overking of D<U+00E1>l Riata, was overthrown as king of the Cen<U+00E9>l Loairn and replaced by his first cousin [[Muiredach mac Ainbcellaig]].<ref>Anderson, ''ESSH'', pp. 227<U+2013>229.</ref>

In 734 Talorgan mac Congussa was handed over to the Picts by his brother, and drowned by them.<ref>Anderson, ''ESSH'', p. 232 & corrigenda, p. xviii.</ref> Talorgan son of Drostan was captured near [[Dunollie Castle|D<U+00FA>n Ollaigh]]. He appears to have been the King of [[Atholl]], and was drowned on <U+00D3>engus's order in 739.<ref>Talorgan was related to Nechtan, and is called his brother in 713, which may mean half-brother, foster-brother, or brother-in-law. Anderson, ''ESSH'', pp. 214 & 236.</ref> D<U+00FA>ngal too was a target in this year. He was wounded, the unidentified fortress of D<U+00FA>n Leithfinn was destroyed, and he "fled into Ireland, to be out of the power of <U+00D3>engus."<ref>Anderson, ''ESSH'', p. 232.</ref>

The annals report a second campaign by <U+00D3>engus against the D<U+00E1>l Riata in 736. D<U+00FA>ngal, who had returned from Ireland, and his brother Feradach, were captured and bound in chains. The fortresses of Creic and [[Dunadd]] were taken. Muiredach of the Cen<U+00E9>l Loairn was no more successful, defeated with heavy loss by <U+00D3>engus's brother Talorgan, perhaps by [[Loch Awe]]. A final campaign in 741 saw the D<U+00E1>l Riata again defeated. This was recorded in the ''Annals of Ulster'' as ''Percutio D<U+00E1>l Riatai la h-<U+00D3>engus m. Forggusso'', the "smiting of D<U+00E1>l Riata by <U+00D3>engus son of Fergus".<ref>AU 741.10, available [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G100001A/text311.html here].</ref> With this D<U+00E1>l Riata disappears from the record for a generation.<ref>Anderson, ''ESSH'', pp. 182 & 232<U+2013>238; Woolf, "Carnifex tyrannus", pp. 36<U+2013>37; M.O. Anderson, ''Kings and Kingship'', pp. 184<U+2013>186. Who led the D<U+00E1>l Riata in 741 is unclear: the sons of [[Fiannamail ua D<U+00FA>nchado]] named by the ''Annals of Ulster'' may be unconnected, and the mention of Alp<U+00ED>n son of Crup, sometimes taken to be the same person as the Alp<U+00ED>n overthrown in 729, may be misplaced.</ref>

It may be that <U+00D3>engus was involved in wars in Ireland, perhaps fighting with <U+00C1>ed All<U+00E1>n, or against him as an ally of [[Cathal mac Finguine]].<ref>Woolf, "Ungus".</ref> The evidence for such involvement is limited. There is the presence of <U+00D3>engus's son Bridei at [[Tory Island]], on the north-west coast of [[Donegal]] in 733, close to the lands of <U+00C1>ed All<U+00E1>n's enemy Flaithbertach mac Loingsig. Less certainly, the ''[[Fragmentary Annals of Ireland]]'' report the presence of a Pictish fleet from [[Fortriu]] fighting for Flaithbertach in 733 rather than against him.<ref>Anderson, ''ESSH'', pp. 227<U+2013>228; Woolf, "Carnifex tyrannus", p. 36. As already noted, most Irish annals say that Flaithbertach was supported by a fleet from D<U+00E1>l Riata.</ref>

==Alt Clut, Northumbria, and Mercia==
In 740, a war between the Picts and the Northumbrians is reported, during which [[Ethelbald of Mercia|<U+00C6>thelbald]], King of [[Mercia]], took advantage of the absence of [[Eadberht of Northumbria]] to ravage his lands, and perhaps burn [[York]].<ref>Anderson, ''SAEC'', pp. 55<U+2013>56.</ref> The reason for the war is unclear, but it has been suggested that it was related to the killing of Earnwine son of [[Eadwulf of Northumbria|Eadwulf]] on Eadberht's orders. Earnwine's father had been an exile in the north after his defeat in the civil war of 705<U+2013>706, and it may be that <U+00D3>engus, or <U+00C6>thelbald, or both, had tried to place him on the Northumbrian throne.<ref>Woolf, "Carnifex tyrannus", p. 37. For Earnwine, see Kirby, p. 150; Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 90.</ref> [[Image:Escomb Church (John Phillips).jpg|thumb|right|[[Escomb Church]], [[County Durham]]. The stone churches built for Nechtan, and perhaps <U+00D3>engus's church at St Andrews, are presumed to have been similar.<ref>Foster, ''Picts, Gaels and Scots'', p. 89.</ref>]]

Battles between the Picts and the Britons of Alt Clut, or [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]], are recorded in 744 and again in 750, when [[Kyle, Ayrshire|Kyle]] was taken from Alt Clut by Eadberht of Northumbria. The 750 battle between the Britons and the Picts is reported at a place named Mocetauc (perhaps Mugdock, near [[Milngavie]]) in which Talorgan the brother of <U+00D3>engus was killed.<ref>Anderson, ''ESSH'', pp. 238<U+2013>239; Anderson, ''SAEC'', p. 56.</ref> Following the defeat in 750, the ''Annals of Ulster'' record "the ebbing of the sovereignty of <U+00D3>engus".<ref>Anderson, ''ESSH'', p. 240.</ref> This is thought to refer to the coming to power of [[<U+00C1>ed Find]], son of Eochaid mac Echdach, in all or part of D<U+00E1>l Riata, and his rejection of <U+00D3>engus's overlordship.<ref>Woolf, "Carnifex tyrannus", p. 38; M.O. Anderson, ''Kings and Kingship'', pp. 186<U+2013>187. The entry for 752 in the ''Annals of Tigernach'', recording "the battle of Asreth in Circinn", is thought to be misplaced.</ref>

Unlike the straightforward narrative of the attacks on D<U+00E1>l Riata, a number of interpretations have been offered of the relations between <U+00D3>engus, Eadberht and <U+00C6>thelbald in the period from 740 to 750. One suggestion is that <U+00D3>engus and <U+00C6>thelbald were allied against Eadberht, or even that they exercised a joint rulership of Britain, or [[bretwalda]]ship, <U+00D3>engus collecting tribute north of the [[River Humber]] and <U+00C6>thelbald south of the Humber. This rests largely on a confused passage in Symeon of Durham's ''Historia Regum Anglorum'', and it has more recently been suggested that the interpretation offered by [[Frank Stenton]]<U+2014>that it is based on a textual error and that <U+00D3>engus and <U+00C6>thelbald were not associated in any sort of joint overlordship<U+2014>is the correct one.<ref>Woolf, "Carnifex tyrannus", p. 38; Anderson, ''SAEC'', p. 56.</ref>

In 756, <U+00D3>engus is found campaigning alongside Eadberht of Northumbria. The campaign is reported as follows: <blockquote>In the year of the Lord's incarnation 756, king Eadberht in the eighteenth year of his reign, and Unust, king of Picts led armies to the town of [[Dumbarton]]. And hence the Britons accepted terms there, on the first day of the month of August. But on the tenth day of the same month perished almost the whole army which he led from Ouania to Niwanbirig.<ref>After Forsyth, p. 29. See also Anderson, ''SAEC'', p. 57.</ref></blockquote>

That Ouania is [[Govan]] is now reasonably certain,<ref>Forsyth, pp. 29<U+2013>30; Woolf, "Carnifex tyrannus", p. 39.</ref> but the location of Newanbirig is less so. Although there are very many Newburghs, it is Newburgh-on-Tyne near [[Hexham]] that has been the preferred location.<ref>Kirby, p. 150.</ref> An alternative interpretation of the events of 756 has been advanced: it identifies Newanbirig with [[Newborough, Staffordshire|Newborough]] by [[Lichfield]] in the kingdom of Mercia. A defeat here for Eadberht and <U+00D3>engus by <U+00C6>thelbald's Mercians would correspond with the claim in the Saint Andrews foundation legends that a king named <U+00D3>engus son of Fergus founded the church there as a thanksgiving to [[Saint Andrew]] for saving him after a defeat in Mercia.<ref>Woolf, "Carnifex tyrannus", pp. 39<U+2013>40. This version of the St Andrews foundation legend is given in M.O. Anderson, ''Kings and Kingship'', pp. 258<U+2013>260.</ref>

==The cult of Saint Andrew==
[[Image:Standrewssarcophagus.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The [[St Andrews Sarcophagus]].]]

The story of the foundation of [[St Andrews]], originally ''Cennr<U+00ED>gmonaid'', is not contemporary and may contain many inventions. The Irish annals report the death of "Tuathal<U+00E1>n, abbot of Cinrigh M<U+00F3>na", in 747, making it certain that St Andrews had been founded before that date, probably by <U+00D3>engus or by Nechtan son of Der-Ilei.<ref>Anderson, ''ESSH'', p. 238; Forsyth, pp. 21<U+2013>22; Foster, "Discovery", pp. 42<U+2013>43; Woolf, "Ungus". The most recent study, Yorke, ''Conversion'', favours <U+00D3>engus.</ref> It is generally presumed that the [[St Andrews Sarcophagus]] was executed at the command of <U+00D3>engus.<ref>Henderson, pp. 155<U+2013>156; MacLean, pp. 200<U+2013>201; Woolf, "Ungus". It is less certain whose remains the sarcophagus contained. Woolf and MacLean argue for <U+00D3>engus while Henderson favours Nechtan mac Der Ilei. Clancy, "Caustant<U+00ED>n", favours a 9th century date.</ref> Later generations may have conflated this king <U+00D3>engus with the 9th century [[<U+00D3>engus II of the Picts|king of the same name]].<ref>Foster, "Discovery", p. 42; Broun, pp. 80<U+2013>81.</ref> The choice of [[David]] as a model is, as [[Alex Woolf]] notes, an appropriate one: David too was an usurper.<ref>Woolf, "Carnifex tyrannus", p. 40.</ref>

The cult of [[Saint Andrew]] may have come to Pictland from Northumbria, as had the cult of [[Saint Peter]] which had been favoured by Nechtan, and in particular from the [[monastery]] at [[Hexham]] which was dedicated to Saint Andrew. This apparent connection with the Northumbrian church may have left a written record. <U+00D3>engus, like his successors and possible kinsmen [[Caustant<U+00ED>n of the Picts|Caustant<U+00ED>n]] and [[Uen of the Picts|E<U+00F3>gan]], is recorded prominently in the ''Liber Vitae Ecclesiae Dunelmensis'', a list of some 3000 benefactors for whom prayers were said in religious institutions connected with [[Durham]].<ref>Forsyth, pp. 25<U+2013>26; Yorke, ''Conversion'', p. 167. <U+00D3>engus is listed 43rd, Caustant<U+00ED>n 80th and E<U+00F3>gan 100th.</ref>

==Death and legacy==
<U+00D3>engus died in 761, "aged probably more than seventy, ... the dominating figure in the politics of Northern Britain".<ref>Forsyth, p. 21.</ref> His death is reported in the usual brief style by the annalists, except for the continuator of Bede in Northumbria, possibly relying upon a D<U+00E1>l Riata source, who wrote: <blockquote><U+00D3>engus, king of the Picts, died. From the beginning of his reign right to the end he perpetrated bloody crimes, like a tyrannical slaughterer.<ref>Forsyth, p. 22; Anderson, ''ESSH'', p. 244; Anderson, ''SAEC'', p. 57; Woolf, "Carnifex tyrannus", p.37.</ref></blockquote> The [[Pictish Chronicle]] king lists have it that he was succeeded by his brother [[Bridei V of the Picts|Bridei]]. His son [[Talorgan II of the Picts|Talorgan]] was later king, and is the first son of a Pictish king known to have become king.<ref>Yorke, ''Conversion'', p. 49. Sons of kings became kings more frequently in the 9th century, but it was not until the 11th century that kings were succeeded by their descendants rather than their brothers or cousins.</ref>

The following 9th century Irish praise poem from the [[Book of Leinster]] is associated with <U+00D3>engus:<ref name="Forsyth">Forsyth, pp. 27<U+2013>28.</ref>

<blockquote>Good the day when <U+00D3>engus took Alba,<br />
hilly Alba with its strong chiefs;<br />
he brought battle to palisaded towns,<br />
with feet, with hands, with broad shields.<ref name="Forsyth"/></blockquote>

An assessment of <U+00D3>engus is problematic, not least because annalistic sources provide very little information on Scotland in the succeeding generations. His apparent Irish links add to the long list of arguments which challenge the idea that the "Gaelicisation" of eastern Scotland began in the time of Cin<U+00E1>ed mac Ailp<U+00ED>n; indeed there are good reasons for believing that process began before <U+00D3>engus's reign.<ref>Nechtan son of [[Der-Ilei]] and his brother [[Bridei IV of the Picts|Bridei]] are thought to have had a Gaelic father, [[Dargart mac Finguine]] of the [[Cen<U+00E9>l Comgaill]]. See Clancy, "Nechtan"; Yorke, ''Conversion'', pp. 54<U+2013>55.</ref> Many of the Pictish kings until the death of [[Uen of the Picts|E<U+00F3>gan mac <U+00D3>engusa]] in 839 belong to the family of <U+00D3>engus, in particular the 9th century sons of Fergus, [[Caustant<U+00ED>n of the Picts|Caustant<U+00ED>n]] and [[<U+00D3>engus II of the Picts|<U+00D3>engus]].<ref>Broun, passim; Woolf, "Carnifex tyrannus", p. 40. Arguing otherwise, see Bannerman, passim. The arguments are compared in Yorke, ''Conversion'', pp. 49<U+2013>50, 54 & 288<U+2013>289.</ref>

The amount of information which has survived about <U+00D3>engus compared with other Pictish kings, the nature and geographical range of his activities and the length of his reign combine to make King <U+00D3>engus one of the most significant rulers of the insular Dark Ages.<ref>The strongest claims are made in those accounts which take <U+00D3>engus to have been joint Bretwalda with <U+00C6>thelbald, such as Charles-Edwards, Forsyth and Yorke. Other, such as Broun and Woolf, make less sweeping claims, but make <U+00D3>engus among the most powerful Pictish kings and the dominant force in northern Britain. For <U+00D3>engus's significance on a cultural and artistic level see Henderson & Henderson, p. 12; MacLean, pp. 200<U+2013>201.</ref>
