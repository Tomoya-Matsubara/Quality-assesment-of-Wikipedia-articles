==Music career==   
Nguyen used modeling as a stepping stone for other ventures. At age twenty, she took interest in rock music and started looking for bands willing to have her join. She eventually assembled a band called Beyond Betty Jean, for which she was singer and songwriter. Following the breakup of Beyond Betty Jean, Nguyen started working in recording studios to sharpen her vocal skills and write music.<ref name="TilasHotSpotQuickBio"/> Nguyen became the lead singer of a band called ''Jealousy'', which has released songs over the Internet. ''Jealousy'' has appeared on MySpace Records' inaugural compilation album, released through [[MySpace Records]] and [[Interscope Records|Interscope]]. 

A major turn in Nguyen's music career occurred during the [[April 24]], [[2006]] taping of [[MTV]]'s ''[[Total Request Live]]''. In an interview with the ''TRL'' VJs, [[will.i.am]] announced that Nguyen was signed to the will.i.am music group, a record label under A&M Records.<ref name="PostChronicle">World Entertainment News Network ([[July 25]], [[2006]]).

Despite her major-label signing, Nguyen independently released her first single "[[I Love U]]" through [[iTunes]] on [[February 27]], [[2007]], justifying the independent release through her desire to become famous by herself.<ref name="amg"/> "I Love U" made its way to the top of the ITunes charts within 24 hours
