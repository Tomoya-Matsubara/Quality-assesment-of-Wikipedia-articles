'''Magnolia Avenue''' is a stop on the [[SEPTA Route 102]] ([[Sharon Hill]]) trolley in [[Aldan, Pennsylvania]]. It is located at Woodlawn & Magnolia Avenues, which is a [[Four-way stop]] intersection in a residential area. Like the former [[Shisler Avenue (SEPTA Route 102 station)|Shisler Avenue]] two stops north, Magnolia Avenue provides no shelter, platforms, or seats, and commuters must wait on the sidewalks of Woodlawn Avenue for trolley cars. Unilke Shisler though, Magnolia is not even near a park or school.

Trolleys arriving at this stop travel between [[69th Street Terminal]] in [[Upper Darby, Pennsylvania]] and [[Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania]]. At this intersection, they run up and down the middle of Woodlawn Avenue. Magnolia Avenue is the most southerly point where the Route 102 line runs along the street in both directions. South of [[North Street (SEPTA Route 102 station)|North Street]], the tracks leave the street and re-enter a separate right-of-way.
