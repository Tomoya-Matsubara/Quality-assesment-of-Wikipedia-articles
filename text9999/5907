'''Imhotep''' is a fictional character first appearing in the 1932 film ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'', and later featured in its [[The Mummy (1999 film)|1999 remake]] and its sequel ''[[The Mummy Returns]]''. He is loosely inspired by the historical figure [[Imhotep]], a counselor the Pharaoh [[Djoser]] in the [[27th century BC]].

==The Mummy (1932)==

In his original appearance, Imhotep was portrayed by [[Boris Karloff]] as a priest of [[Ancient Egypt]] who is [[mummification|mummified]] by an unnamed pharaoh as punishment for attempting to resurrect his lover,  Princess Ankh-es-en-amon. Imhotep is accidentally revived when an archaeological expedition discovers his mummy and one of the archaeologists unknowingly reads an ancient life-giving spell. 

Imhotep escapes from the archaeologists and assumes the identity of Ardath Bey, a modern Egyptian. In this form he helps the archaeologists find the tomb of Ankh-es-en-amon. When Bey meets a  woman, Helen Grosvenor, who bears a striking resemblance to the Ankh-es-en-amon, he realizes that she is a [[reincarnation]] of the princess, and attempts to mummify Grosvenor and make her his bride. In the end Grosvenor, recalling her past life, appeals to the goddess [[Isis]] who causes Imhotep to be dissolved.

==Sequels==

In the immediate sequels to the 1932 film, the mummy is known as [[Kharis]], though this character has a back story that is very similar to Imhotep's.

==''The Mummy'' (1999)==

In the 1999 remake, '''Imhotep''' (portrayed by [[Arnold Vosloo]]) is  the high priest of Pharaoh [[Seti I]], who betrayed his [[pharaoh]] out of love for Seti's mistress, Ankh-su-namun. Imhotep was subjected to a curse as punishment for his attempt to resurrect Ankh-su-namun after she kills Seti: He is condemned to remain alive as he is devoured by sacred [[scarab]]s for all eternity. If awakened, however, he would command the sands and the [[Ten Plagues]], as well as being virtually immortal. 

After he is unintentionally awakened in the 1920s, Imhotep seeks to use Evelyn Carnahan as the sacrifice with which he will resurrect Ankh-su-namun. Evelyn, with the help of soldier [[Rick O'Connell]],  finds a spell that rescinds Imhotep's immortality and strips him of his powers, sending his soul to the underworld. 

==''The Mummy Returns''==

In the 2001 sequel, ''[[The Mummy Returns]]'', Imhotep is resurrected by an ancient brotherhood who seek to pit him against the [[Scorpion King]], thus granting him command of the army of [[Anubis]] with which he can conquer the world. Aided by the physical reincarnation of Ankh-su-namun &mdash; whose soul is eventually fully restored to her body &mdash; Imhotep makes his way to the Scorpion King's temple, but his powers are taken by Anubis, who wishes him to fight the King as a mortal. 

As he and Rick O'Connell clash against each other and the King, Rick uses the Spear of [[Osiris]], a powerful mystical weapon, to open a portal to [[Hell]]. When Evelyn risks her life to save Rick while Ankh-su-namun flees rather than trying to help Imhotep, the resurrected priest hurls himself into Hell in despair.
