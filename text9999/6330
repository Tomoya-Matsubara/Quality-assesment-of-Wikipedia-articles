==Background and early life==
Byrne is the son of Edward Byrne. Edward Byrne joined the [[Irish volunteers]] in 1912{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}, and subsequently joined the [[19th Hussars]], Infantry Division, when [[World War I]] (1914<U+2013>1918) broke out. He later fought during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. He fought throughout most of the War, including at O'Connell Street.<ref name="Byrne, p. 5">Byrne, ''The Time of My Life'', p. 5</ref> Shortly after the War, Edward Byrne was employed by Guinness' [[St. James's Gate Brewery]] where he worked for most of the rest of his life. He worked on the barges that operated on the river Liffey, transporting wooden casks from St. James's Gate Brewery to ships at the [[North Wall (Dublin)|North Wall]], [[Dublin]].<ref>Byrne, ''The Time of My Life'', pp 6 - 7, & pp 11 - 12.</ref> Edward Byrne was the son of Alexander Byrne, a coachman to the [[Earl of Meath]], who lived at a lodge on the Earl's estate near [[Kilruddery]], [[County Wicklow]].<ref name="Byrne, p. 5"/>

Byrne's father, Edward, married his mother, Annie Carroll (from [[Bray]]), at [[Belfast]], in 1917, when briefly home on leave from the War. The two had met near Bray just before the War began. Gay Byrne is the youngest of six children from that marriage. However, one child, his brother Joseph, died as a one-week old infant. Listed in descending order (according to age), the other children are Edward, Al, Ernest, and Mary.

Byrne was born and grew up in Dublin. He was born 5 August 1934.<ref>Byrne, ''The Time of My Life'', p. 18</ref><ref>[http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2004/08/05/story819334807.asp Irish Examiner, 5 August 2004] (The [[Irish Examiner]] is an Irish newspaper).</ref> He first lived with his family at 17 Rialto Street, [[Rialto (Dublin)|Rialto]], Dublin, before his parents moved to 124 (later renumbered 512) [[South Circular Road (Dublin)|South Circular Road]], Dublin, in 1944. 

Byrne attended Rialto National School (since closed) and a number of other schools for short periods. Subsequently, he was educated by the Irish [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] at [[Synge Street CBS]].<ref name="Gay top of class as he launches online children's book club"/> He and two classmates bought a [[jazz]] record when Byrne was fourteen years old in January 1948, at a time when Radio <U+00C9>ireann refused to play it because of its "licentious" content.<ref name="The chameleon of Montrose"/>

After attending Synge Street CBS he worked at the North Strand cinema.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} He subsequently became a clerk in an insurance company.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} He then worked as a sales representative.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} He also met foreign dignitaries at Dublin Airport and welcomed them to Ireland.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In 2009, whilst celebrating the 250th anniversary of Guinness, he revealed that he had once tried unsuccessfully to earn a job in the brewery near his childhood home.<ref name="Gay remembers life in the Liberties">{{cite web|url=http://www.dublinpeople.com/content/view/2636/56/|title=Gay remembers life in the Liberties|date=2009-11-26|accessdate=2009-12-11|publisher=''[[Dublin People]]''}}</ref>

Byrne's mother, Annie, died in late 1964.<ref>Byrne, ''The Time of My Life'', p. 89</ref>

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Whilst young, Byrne was inspired by the broadcaster [[Eamonn Andrews]], who had a successful career on British television, and "wanted to be what he was".<ref name="Gay Byrne, this is not quite your life">{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2005/02/06/story2065.asp|title=Gay Byrne, this is not quite your life|date=2005-02-06|accessdate=2009-07-30|publisher=''[[The Sunday Business Post]]''}}</ref> Andrews was friendly with Byrne's eldest brother.<ref name="Radio Veteran Gay is walking on air"/> In 1958 he moved over to broadcasting when he became a presenter on [[Raidi<U+00F3> Teilif<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann|Radio <U+00C9>ireann]]. He also worked with [[Granada Television]] and the [[BBC]] in [[England]]. Whilst at Granada, Byrne became the first person to introduce [[The Beatles]] on television when they made their small screen debut on local news programme ''[[Granada Reports|People and Places]]''.<ref name="The chameleon of Montrose"/>

In 1961, [[Raidi<U+00F3> Teilif<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann|Telef<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann]] (later Radio Telef<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann and now [[Raidi<U+00F3> Teilif<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann]]) was set up. He finally worked exclusively for the new Irish service after 1969. He introduced many popular programmes, with his most popular and successful programme being ''The Late Late Show''.

===Radio career===
{{Main|The Gay Byrne Show}}
Byrne began his broadcasting career on radio.

Radio <U+00C9>ireann gave him a 15-minute slot on Monday nights which he used to play [[Jazz]], his first broadcast for the station being in 1958.<ref name="The chameleon of Montrose"/>

He is now best remembered for his two hour morning show, ''The Gay Byrne Hour'', which was later renamed ''[[The Gay Byrne Show]]'' (1972&ndash;1999). For many years the show was produced by [[John Caden]]. [[Joe Duffy]] was a reporter on ''The Gay Byrne Show'' and subsequently succeeded him as presenter. 

He continues to play jazz on radio during his retirement.<ref name="The chameleon of Montrose"/>

On 5 July 1962, the first episode of ''The Late Late Show'' was aired on Irish television.<ref name="The chameleon of Montrose"/> Originally the show was scheduled as an eight-week summer filler. The programme, which is still broadcast, has become the world's longest running [[Talk show|chat show]]. The show became a forum where controversial topics such as the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Birth control|contraception]],<ref name="The chameleon of Montrose"/> [[AIDS]], [[unemployment]], [[homosexuality]],<ref name="The chameleon of Montrose"/> [[abortion]], [[divorce]], and other hitherto [[taboo]] subjects were discussed openly in Ireland, alongside book reviews, celebrity visits, and music acts like [[The Boomtown Rats]], [[U2]], [[Sin<U+00E9>ad O'Connor]], [[Elkie Brooks]], [[Boyzone]], and [[Noel Gallagher]]. Other guests included [[President of Ireland|Presidents of Ireland]], successive [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishops of Armagh]], minor members of the [[British Royal Family]], politicians, actors, authors and countless others.

The show had much to do in shaping the new Ireland that was emerging from the 1960s. Indeed it was famously said by politician and [[Papal Orders of Chivalry|Papal Knight]], [[Oliver J. Flanagan]] that, "there was no sex<ref>Public discussion of.</ref> in Ireland until Teilif<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann went on the air".<ref name="From polygamy and orgies to the Late, Late 'scandals'">{{cite web|author=Kim Bielenberg|url=http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/features/from-polygamy-and-orgies--to-the-late-late-scandals-324772.html|title=From polygamy and orgies to the Late, Late 'scandals'|date=2001-12-29|accessdate=2009-09-17|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}</ref> Bishop of Galway Michael Browne called him "a purveyor of filth" after he asked a woman what colour nightie she wore on her wedding night and she had replied that she believed she'd worn nothing.<ref name="The chameleon of Montrose"/><ref name=Indo>{{cite news|title=The Sex Factor|url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/independent-woman/love-sex/the-sex-factor-1491630.html|accessdate=31 August 2011|newspaper=The Irish Independent|date=7 October 2008}}</ref>  However, Byrne saw himself as a presenter, not a radical social reformer, though his style was more challenging and less deferential than the style of his successor as presenter of ''The Late Late Show'', [[Pat Kenny]].<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/tv/latelate/pat.html RT<U+00C9> Television - The Late Late Show]</ref>{{Failed verification|date=July 2009}}

More than a decade after departing his role as host of ''The Late Late Show'' Byrne is remembered for conducting memorable interviews with former politician [[P<U+00E1>draig Flynn]] and then [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Galway, Kilmacduagh and Kilfenora|Bishop of Galway]] [[Eamon Casey]]{{'}}s lover Annie Murphy, among others.<ref name="The chameleon of Montrose"/> Another memorable moment to occur on ''The Late Late Show'' was when he called the winner of a prize car live on air only to discover the woman's daughter had died since she had entered.<ref name="The chameleon of Montrose"/>

During the early years of Byrne's time hosting ''The Late Late Show'', prior to about 1978 when the second national Irish TV channel was launched, he was employed by RT<U+00C9> on a continuously renewing 3-month contract, lest his employer might want to fire him any time they choose.<ref>RT<U+00C9> television documentary aired in March 2007</ref>

Byrne and ''The Late Late Show'' were central to the development of the careers of figures such as [[Mary Coughlan (singer)|Mary Coughlan]].<ref name="The longest journey home">{{cite web|author=Kevin Mcguire|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/19976|title=The longest journey home|date=2009-12-10|accessdate=2009-12-11|publisher=''[[Galway Advertiser]]''|quote=Coughlan leaped ahead of her contemporaries when she was invited to appear on ''The Late Late Show''.

He was noted for wearing a "[[Bing Crosby]] sweater" when presenting ''[[The Late Late Toy Show]]''.<ref name="The chameleon of Montrose"/>

On 21 May 1999, Byrne presented his last edition of ''The Late Late Show''. He was presented with a [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle by [[Bono]] and [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]]<ref name="The chameleon of Montrose"/> [[Pat Kenny]] succeeded Byrne as presenter in September 1999, subsequently succeeded by [[Ryan Tubridy]] in September 2009. He gave Tubridy his blessing upon taking over the role, saying: "He has all the qualities required, the light deft touch together with a serious mind. I think it's a great adventure that he's setting off on".<ref name="Gay Byrne talks Tubridy and Late Late Show">{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2009/0817/byrneg.html|title=Gay Byrne talks Tubridy and Late Late Show|date=2009-08-17|accessdate=2009-08-18|publisher=[[Raidi<U+00F3> Teilif<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann|RT<U+00C9>]]}}</ref> Byrne returned to ''The Late Late Show'' as a guest twice during Tubridy's [[The Late Late Show (season 47)|first season]] as presenter, the latter appearance on the day of [[Death of Gerry Ryan|Gerry Ryan's death]].<ref name="Late Late Show guests are revealed (18 December 2009)">{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2009/1218/thelatelateshow.html|title=Late Late Show guests are revealed|date=2009-12-18|accessdate=2009-12-18|publisher=[[Raidi<U+00F3> Teilif<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann|RT<U+00C9>]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Sweeney, Ken|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/record-numbers-tuned-in-for-the-late-late-tribute-2164596.html|title=Record numbers tuned in for the 'Late Late' tribute|date=5 May 2010|work=[[Irish Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News & Media]]|accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref>

====Other television work====
Byrne compered the finals of the [[Castlebar Song Contest]] in 1966 and 1967. He also presented [[Rose of Tralee (festival)|The Rose of Tralee]] festival for 17 years until 1994. Between 1988 and 2001, Byrne hosted the [[Raidi<U+00F3> Teilif<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann|RT<U+00C9>]] [[People in Need Trust|People in Need]] [[People in Need Telethon|Telethon]] several times.

Byrne was involved in a famous television moment with colleague [[Mike Murphy (broadcaster)|Mike Murphy]] when a disguised Murphy conned him into believing he was a French tourist.<ref name="The chameleon of Montrose"/>

==Retirement==
Byrne published his autobiography co-written with Deirdre Purcell.<ref>''The Time of My Life: An Autobiography'' Author: Byrne, Gay & Deirdre Purcell, Published by Gill & Macmillan Dublin 1989, ISBN 0-7171-1615-8</ref>

Byrne has not completely retired and continues to feature occasionally on radio and television. He hosted for one season, the Irish version of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (Ireland)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]''. He also hosted ''The Gay Byrne Music Show'' and ''Make 'Em Laugh'', a series about comedy in Ireland, ''[[Gaybo's Grumpy Men]]'', ''Class Reunion'' and ''[[For One Night Only (Irish TV series)|For One Night Only]]''.

In the summer season of 2000, Byrne hosted ''The Gay Byrne Music Show'', which was a studio-based show aired on Saturday nights as a summer "filler" between 8 July and 19 August 2000 and showcased all genres of music in the company of the [[RT<U+00C9> Concert Orchestra]].

In April 2009, RT<U+00C9> One began broadcasting a series called ''[[The Meaning of Life (TV series)|The Meaning of Life]]'' during which Gay Byrne interviewed public figures about issues of meaning and life.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/tv/meaningoflife/ The Meaning Of Life with Gay Byrne], RTE.ie</ref> He prefers not to discuss his own faith: {{cquote|I am not going to say, because it would compromise me in terms of the show if people knew I had a position.

==Approach for the Presidency==
{{Main article|Irish presidential election, 2011}}
In August 2011, Byrne was approached<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.independent.ie/opinion/editorial/decision-time-gaybo-2846554.html|title= Decision time, Gaybo|author= |date= 12 August 2011|work= [[Irish Independent]]|publisher= |accessdate=12 August 2011}}</ref> by the once dominant political party [[Fianna F<U+00E1>il]] as a possible independent nominee<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0805/president.html|title= Fianna F<U+00E1>il not commenting on Gay Byrne|author= |date= 5 August 2011|work= [[Raidi<U+00F3> Teilif<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann|RT<U+00C9>]]|publisher= |accessdate=9 August 2011}}</ref> for that year's Irish presidential election. The media advised Byrne, who having enjoyed an avuncular relationship with the public as a performer over many decades, editorialised against such a move. An editorial in the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' said that <br> ''This isn't some sort of a reality TV show but a contest for the highest office in the land.''</br> ''[[The Irish Times]]'' queried the distinction between Byrne as a performer versus Byrne as an individual.<br>''But who is it that the Irish people really love? Is it Gaybo or Gabriel Byrne? Given they don<U+2019>t really know the man himself <U+2013> a man who has retained his privacy throughout a lifetime of fame <U+2013> the love is surely for the persona rather than the person.''</br> <ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2011/0812/1224302299557.html?via=mr "Gaybo's crafted persona and the man named Byrne"].
