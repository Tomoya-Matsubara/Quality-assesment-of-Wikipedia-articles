'''''Mingus Ah Um''''' is a [[jazz]] album by [[Charles Mingus]], recorded and released on [[Columbia Records]] in 1959, as CK 65512. It was his first album recorded for Columbia. The cover features a painting by [[S. Neil Fujita]].<ref>http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/waxing-chromatic-an-interview-with-s-neil-fujita</ref>

==Pieces==
''[[The Penguin Guide to Jazz]] on CD'' calls this album "an extended tribute to ancestors" (and awards it one of their rare crowns), and Mingus's musical forebears figure largely throughout.  "Better Git It In Your Soul" is inspired by gospel singing and preaching of the sort that Mingus would have heard as a child growing up in [[Watts, Los Angeles, California]], while "[[Goodbye Pork Pie Hat]]" is a reference (by way of his favored headgear) to saxophonist [[Lester Young]] (who had died shortly before the album was recorded).  The origin and nature of "Boogie Stop Shuffle" is self-explanatory: a [[twelve-bar blues]] with four themes and a [[boogie]] bass backing that passes from [[stop-time|stop time]] to [[Shuffle_note|shuffle]] and back.  

"Self-Portrait in Three Colors" was originally written for [[John Cassavetes]]' first film as director, ''[[Shadows (1959 film)|Shadows]]'', but was never used (for budgetary reasons). "Open Letter to Duke" is a tribute to [[Duke Ellington]], and draws on three of Mingus's earlier pieces ("Nouroog", "Duke's Choice", and "Slippers").  "Jelly Roll" is a reference to jazz pioneer and pianist [[Jelly Roll Morton]]; "Bird Calls," in Mingus' own words, was not a reference to bebop legend [[Charlie Parker|Charlie "Bird" Parker]]: "It wasn't supposed to sound like Charlie Parker. It was supposed to sound like birds - the first part."

"[[Fables of Faubus]]" is named after [[Orval Faubus|Orval E. Faubus]] (1910&ndash;1994), the [[List of Governors of Arkansas|Governor of Arkansas]] infamous for his [[1957]] [[desegregation|stand against integration]] of [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] schools in defiance of [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] rulings (forcing [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]] to send in the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]]).  It is sometimes claimed that Columbia refused to allow the lyrics to be included on this album, though the liner notes to the 1998 reissue of the album state that the piece started life as an instrumental, and only gained the lyrics later (as can be heard on the 1960 release [[Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus|''Presents Charles Mingus'']].)

==Reception==
''Mingus Ah Um'' was one of fifty recordings chosen by the [[Library of Congress]] to be added to the [[National Recording Registry]] in 2003.

==Track listing==
When Columbia first issued the album in 1959, six of the album's nine songs (tracks 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 9) were edited in order to fit them on the [[Gramophone record|LP]]; certain songs were shortened by several minutes. These six tracks were first restored in 1979 and three other recordings were discovered. Later reissues contain both the full-length versions of the original nine tracks and the three new tracks.

All songs composed by [[Charles Mingus]], except 12, composed by Sonny Clapp. Original shortened song lengths are given within parentheses.

==50th Anniversary Legacy Edition==
In 2009 Sony's [http://www.legacyrecordings.com/music/charles-mingus/ah-um-50th-anniversary-legacy-edition Legacy Recordings] released a special 2-disc 50th Anniversary Edition of ''Mingus Ah Um''. In addition to the complete album, the Legacy Edition includes three alternate takes: "Bird Calls (alternate)"  (4:54), "Better Git It In Your Soul (alternate)"  (8:30), and the standout "Jelly Roll (alternate)" (6:41). Oddly, the Legacy Edition of ''Mingus Ah Um'' also includes ''[[Mingus Dynasty]]'', an album recorded later in 1959 (with unedited versions of five tracks shortened on the original LP release).<ref>[http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13163-mingus-ah-um/ Album Review - Mingus Ah Um: Legacy Edition.
