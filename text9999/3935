The '''Wainwright Building''' (also known as the '''Wainwright State Office Building''') is a 10-story red-brick landmark office building at 709 Chestnut Street in [[Downtown St. Louis|downtown]] [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Built between 1890 and 1891<ref>"skyscraper." The Columbia Encyclopedia. New York: Columbia University Press, 2008. Credo Reference. Web. 25 March 2011.</ref> and designed by [[Dankmar Adler]] and [[Louis Sullivan]], it was among the first [[skyscraper]]s in the world. It was named for local financier [[Ellis Wainwright]].<ref group="n">Sullivan also designed the [[Wainwright Tomb]] in St. Louis's [[Bellefontaine and Calvary Cemeteries|Bellefontaine Cemetery]] for his wife Charlotte Dickson Wainwright.</ref>

It is described as "a highly influential prototype of the modern office building" by the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name="nris">{{NRISref|2007a}}</ref> Architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] called the Wainwright Building "the very first human expression of a tall steel office-building as Architecture."<ref>{{Cite journal| last = Wright| first = Frank Lloyd| authorlink=Frank Lloyd Wright| title = The Tyranny of the Skyscraper| journal = Modern Architecture| pages = 85| publisher = Princeton University Press| location = Princeton| year = 1931 }}</ref>

The building is currently owned by the State of Missouri and houses state offices.<ref name="state offices">{{cite news|title= Best of Political Fix|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=February 12, 2009}}</ref>

==Commission, design and construction==
The Wainwright building was commissioned by Ellis Wainwright, a St. Louis brewer. Wainwright needed office space to manage the St Louis Brewers Association.<ref name="Korom (2008) p. 167">{{cite book|last=Korom|first=Joseph J.|title=The American Skyscraper, 1850-1940: A Celebration of Height|year=2008|pages=167|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JVzYO1TyZ6AC&pg=PA169&dq=%22Wainwright+Building%22&hl=en&ei=0S-JTdL3IOHH0QHG0_j1DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=%22Wainwright%20Building%22&f=false|publisher= Branden Books|ISBN=0828321884}}</ref> It was the second major commission for a tall building won by the [[Adler & Sullivan]] firm, which had grown to international prominence after the creation of the ten-story [[Auditorium Building]] in Chicago (designed in 1886 and completed in 1889).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Elstein|first=Rochelle Berger|title=Adler & Sullivan: The End of the Partnership and Its Aftermath|journal=Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society|date=Spring - Summer, 2005|volume=98|issue=1/2|pages=51-81}}</ref>  As designed, the first floor of the Wainwright Building was intended for street-accessible shops, with the second floor filled with easily accessible public offices. The higher floors were for "honeycomb" offices, while the top floor was for water tanks and building machinery.<ref name="van Zanten">{{cite journal|last=van Zanten|first=David|title=Master of the Skyscraper|journal=Humanities|year=2002|month=March/April|volume=23|issue=2|url=http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/2002-03/skyscraper.html}}</ref>

==Architecture==
Aesthetically, the Wainwright Building exemplifies Sullivan's theories about the tall building, which included a tripartite (three-part) composition (base-shaft-attic) based on the structure of the classical column,<ref>"THE CHICAGO SCHOOL, BEAUX-ARTS, AND THE CITY BEAUTIFUL." The Greenwood Encyclopedia of American Regional Cultures: The Midwest. Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2004. Credo Reference. Web. 25 March 2011.</ref> and his desire to emphasize the height of the building. He wrote: "[The skyscraper] must be tall, every inch of it tall. The force and power of altitude must be in it the glory and pride of exaltation must be in it. It must be every inch a proud and soaring thing, rising in sheer exultation that from bottom to top it is a unit without a single dissenting line." His 1896 article cited his Wainwright Building as an example.<ref>{{Cite journal| last = Sullivan| first = Louis H.| authorlink=Louis Sullivan| title = The tall office building artistically considered| journal = Lippincott's Magazine| volume = | issue = | pages = | date = March 1896| year = | url = http://www.njit.edu/v2/Library/archlib/pub-domain/sullivan-1896-tall-bldg.html| doi = | id = }}</ref>

Historian [[Carl W. Condit]] described the Wainwright as "a building with a strong, vigorously articulated base supporting a screen that constitutes a vivid image of powerful upward movement."<ref>{{cite book| last = Condit| first = Carl W.| authorlink = Carl W. Condit| title = The Chicago School of Architecture: A History of Commercial and Public Building in the Chicago Area, 1875<U+2013>1925| publisher = University of Chicago Press| year = 1973| isbn = 0226114554| unused_data = ISBN status = May be invalid - please double check}}</ref> The base contained retail stores that required wide glazed openings; Sullivan's ornament made the supporting [[pier (architecture)|piers]] read as pillars. Above it the semi-public nature of offices up a single flight of stairs are expressed as broad windows in the [[curtain wall]]. A [[cornice]] separates the second floor from the grid of identical windows of the screen wall, where each window is "a cell in a honeycomb, nothing more".<ref>Sullivan, quoted in David Van Zanten, ''Sullivan's city: the meaning of ornament for Louis Sullivan''.</ref>

The [[Ornament (art)|ornamentation]] for the building, largely confined to the wide frieze below the deep cornice, expresses the formalized yet naturalistic celery-leaf foliage typical of Sullivan and published in his ''System of Architectural Ornament''. It is pierced by unobtrusive [[Oeil-de-boeuf|bull's-eye windows]] that light the top-story floor, originally containing water tanks and elevator machinery. The building includes embellishments of [[glazed architectural terra-cotta|terra cotta]],<ref>{{cite news|title= More than meets the arch|work=Post-Tribune|date=April 19, 2009|author=Mike Michaelson}}</ref> a building material that was newly-invented at the time of construction.<ref>{{cite news|title= Guaranty glows in film role - Landmark featured in documentary on famous architect|work=The Buffalo News|date=October 6, 2010|author=Mark Sommer}}</ref>

Some architectural elements from the building have been removed in renovations and taken to the [[Sauget, Illinois]] storage site of the [[St. Louis Building Arts Foundation]].<ref>[http://www.buildingmuseum.org/recovery.htm List of Recovered Buildings]</ref>

==History==

The Wainwright building was initially rescued from demolition by the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] when the Trust took an option on the structure. <ref>[http://stlcin.missouri.org/history/structdetail.cfm?master_id=1361 St. Louis Historic Preservation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Later, it was acquired by Missouri as part of a state office complex and the St. Louis Landmarks Association, in one of its early victories, is credited with having rescued the Wainwright Building from a construction project.<ref>{{cite news |title= New boss at Landmarks juggles many challenges Revitalization of Arch grounds could be agency's biggest preservation battle.|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=December 2, 2008|author=Matthew Hathaway}}</ref> The neighboring Lincoln Trust building (later known as the Title Guaranty building; designed by [[Eames and Young]], built in 1898 at 706 Chestnut St.) was demolished to make way for the [[Gateway Mall (St. Louis)|Gateway Mall]] in 1983. Carolyn Toft, Landmarks Association's executive director, stated that this building "... formed an ensemble with three other late-19th century commercial buildings, including [the Wainwright Building], that could not be equaled anywhere else in the country. Saving the Wainwright was important, but how much more important it would have been to save the entire group."<ref>{{cite news |title= Gone but not forgotten We asked our panel of experts to select demolished buildings that have left an unfillable gap in the cityscape or the city's collective memory.|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=July 27, 2008|author=David Bonetti and Diane Toroian Keaggy}}</ref>

After a period of neglect, the building now houses Missouri state offices.<ref name="state offices" /> 

In 1968, the building was designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] <ref>[http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=807&ResourceType=Building National Historic Landmarks Program (NHL)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and in 1972 it was named a city landmark. <ref>[http://stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/planning/cultural-resources/city-landmarks/Wainwright-Builiding.cfm Wainwright Building<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Architect John D. Randall led an extensive letter-writing campaign to the governor and other noted officials; the campaign resulted in the restoration of the building as a state office building instead of its demolition.<ref>{{cite news
