'''''Australian Princess''''' is an popular [[Australian]] [[reality television]] show, hosted by [[Jackie O (radio host)|Jackie O]], however the 3rd season will probably see a change in host following Jackie's recent contract with Channel 9.

''Australian Princess'' first premiered on [[Network Ten]] on [[5 October]],[[2005]].

''Australian Princess'' is produced by [[Granada Productions]], who are responsible for other programs such as ''[[Dancing with the Stars (Australia)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', ''[[Australia's Next Top Model]]'' and ''[[Merrick and Rosso|Merrick and Rosso Unplanned]]''.

Fuelled by the [[fairytale]] story of [[Mary Donaldson]], who, in 2004, married [[Denmark]]<U+2019>s heir to the throne, [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|Crown Prince Frederick]], ''Australian Princess'' scoured the country to find 12 young Australian women and give them the journey of their lives. [[Paul Burrell]], former [[butler]] to [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] and footman in the Royal Household of Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]], led a team of international experts, who attempted to shape these ordinary 'Aussie' girls into worldly sophisticated women ready to handle the challenges of being a young royal.

The contestants took classes, met challenges and attempted to convince the judges that they have what it takes to mix in elite social circles both in Australia and the [[United Kingdom]]. Ally Mansell from [[University of Wollongong|UOW]] was announced the winner during the final show, which was aired in Australia on  [[November 23]], [[2005]]  She was crowned a "princess" in the finale and won a prize package including a hand gilded tiara and the chance to be escorted to a gala ball by a real life [[Prince Charming]] in the United Kingdom.

Australian Princess Series 2 has recently finished. Kylie Booby was crowned the winner.

===Series One===

The first season of Australian Princess was aired in late 2005 on [[Network Ten]]. Despite initial critical cynicism of the program's concept, it quickly gained cult status and was praised for the quality of its production, witty and often cringe-induced humour (one recalls a contestant's sobbing lament of the deaths of two icons she held dear - [[Diana Princess of Wales]], and [[Tupak Shakur]]). The series was released on DVD on 12 December 2005.

* [[Ally Mansell]], 20, [[New South Wales]] '''(Winner)'''
Studying education at university, Ally Mansell was portrayed as a surfer chick. 
Ally's commentary was noted on the imalwaysright website: 

She then cemented her position in our legendary books after commenting on Phillip's ballroom dancing, saying "he was dancing like he had something stuck up his arse", followed by calling James Whitaker a "pervert".

Described as "the girl from the farm" [[Wendy Slack-Smith]] was the initial favourite to be crowned Australian Princess by the Australian public. Well-spokeness, intelligence and a great sense of humour in addition to her style transformation won Wendy acclaim from judges. Wendy was described by [[Paul Burrell]] as having 'a great warmth' and said he felt 'all fuzzy inside' whenever she spoke to him. This warmth in addition to her fast learning and ability to engage anybody saw Wendy constantly impress the judges and beat other contestants in the competitions.

Single mother, model and business person [[Abby Valdes]] was regarded by the judges as the most sophisticated of the contestants.

Succeeding in the face of adversity within and out of the series, Abby demonstrated herself to be hard-working and a fighter.(In one episode, Abby described the difficulty she  experienced because of her family's attitude towards her having a child young; in another episode, the love triangle between Abby, [[Laura Kiddle]] and beau Harry sparked conflict between Abby and Laura.)
