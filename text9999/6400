'''"A Song for Simeon"''' is a 37-line poem written in 1928 by American-English poet [[T. S. Eliot]] (1888<U+2013>1965).  It is [[T. S. Eliot's Ariel poems|one of five poems]] that Eliot contributed for a series of 38 [[pamphlet]]s by several authors collectively titled ''[[Ariel poems (Faber)|Ariel poems]]'' and released by British publishing house Faber and Gwyer (later, [[Faber and Faber]]).  Published in September 1928, "A Song for Simeon" was the sixteenth in the series and was accompanied by illustrations drawn by American-born [[avant garde]] artist [[Edward McKnight Kauffer]] (1890<U+2013>1954).<ref>Eliot, T(homas). S(tearns). "A Song for Simeon" in Ariel 16. (London: Faber and Faber, 1928).</ref> The poems, including "A Song for Simeon", were later published in both editions of Eliot's collected poems in 1936 and 1963.<ref name="TSECollectedPoems">Eliot, T(homas).

(London: Faber & Faber; New York: Harcourt Brace, 1963).</ref>

In the previous year, Eliot had [[Religious conversion|converted]] to [[Anglo-Catholicism]] and his poetry, starting with the ''Ariel Poems'' (1927<U+2013>1931) and ''[[Ash Wednesday]]'' (1930), took on a decidedly religious character.<ref name="TimmermanTSEArielPoems">Timmerman, John H. ''T. S. Eliot<U+2019>s Ariel Poems: The Poetics of Recovery''. (Lewisburg, Pennsylvania: Bucknell University Press, 1994), 117<U+2013>123.</ref> The poem is seen by many critics and scholars as a discussion of the conversion experience. In the poem, Eliot retells the story of [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|Simeon]] from the second chapter of the [[Gospel of Luke]], a just and devout Jew who encounters [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] and the infant [[Jesus]] entering the [[Temple of Jerusalem]].  Promised by the [[Holy Ghost]] that he would not die until he had seen the Saviour, Simeon sees in the infant Jesus the [[Messiah]] promised by the Lord and asks God to permit him to "depart in peace." ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=2|verse=25|range=<U+2013>35}})

The poem's narrative mimics the ''[[Nunc dimittis]]'', a liturgical prayer for [[Compline]] derived from the Gospel passage. Eliot introduces literary [[allusion]]s to earlier writers [[Lancelot Andrewes]], [[Dante Alighieri]], [[St. John of the Cross]].  Several critics have debated whether Eliot's depiction of Simeon is a negative portrayal of a [[Judaism|Jewish]] figure and evidence of Eliot's [[anti-Semitism]].

==Writing and publication==
[[File:Thomas Stearns Eliot by Lady Ottoline Morrell (1934).jpg|thumb|right|T. S. Eliot in 1934]]
In 1925, Eliot became a poetry editor at the London publishing firm of Faber & Gwyer, Ltd.,<ref name="MurphyTSECompanion">Murphy, Russell Elliott. ''Critical Companion to T. S. Eliot: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work''. (New York: Facts on File/InfoBase Publishing, 2007).</ref>{{rp|pp.50<U+2013>51}} after a career in banking, and subsequent to the success of his earlier poems, including "[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]" (1915), "[[Gerontion]]" (1920) and "[[The Waste Land]]" (1922).

In these years, Eliot gravitated away from his [[Unitarian]] upbringing and began to embrace the [[Church of England]] which led to his [[baptism]] on 29 June 1927 at [[Finstock]], in [[Oxfordshire]], and his confirmation the following day in the private chapel of The Right Reverend [[Thomas Banks Strong]], [[Bishop of Oxford]].<ref name="MurphyTSECompanion" />{{rp|pp.18}}<ref name="GordonTSEImperfectLife">Gordon, Lyndell. ''T. S. Eliot: An Imperfect Life''.

Retrieved 24 October 2013.</ref> When his [[Religious conversion|conversion]] became known, it was "an understandable choice to those around him" given his intellectual convictions, and that "he could not have done anything less than seek what he regarded as the most ancient, most sacramental, and highest expresession of the Christian faith that forms the indisputable basis for the culture and civilization of modern Europe."<ref name="MurphyTSECompanion" />{{rp|pp.18}} Eliot's conversion, and his adherence to [[Anglo-Catholicism]], would inform and influence his later poetry.<ref name="TimmermanTSEArielPoems" />  Critical reviews of Eliot's poems shifted as well, with some critics asserting that the Christian themes "deprived his art of its once incomparable distinction in style and tone",<ref>Zabel, Morton D. "T. S. Eliot in Mid-Career," in ''Poetry'' (September 1931): 36:330<U+2013>37.</ref> while others recognized it as "an evaluation of old age, an elucidation of its special grace, and an appreciation of its special function in the progress of the soul."<ref>Symes, Gordon. <U+201C>T.

In 1927, Eliot was asked by his employer, [[Geoffrey Faber]], one of the partners in Faber & Gwyer, to write one poem each year for a series of illustrated pamphlets with holiday themes to be sent to the firm's clients and business acquaintances as Christmas greetings.<ref name="MurphyTSECompanion" />{{rp|pp.19,50,376}} This series, called the [[Ariel poems (Faber)|"Ariel Series"]], would release 38 [[pamphlet]]s from a selection of English writers and poets from 1927 through 1931.

"The Journey of the Magi" (London: Faber & Gwyer, 1927).</ref> For the second, "A Song for Simeon", Eliot turned to an event at the end of Nativity narrative in the [[Gospel of Luke]].

===Gospel narrative and the ''Nunc dimittis''===
Most scholars and critics addressing the poem focus on the Gospel narrative for a source of interpretation as Eliot's poem quotes several lines verbatim from the passage in Luke, from the ''Nunc dimittis'', and is "characterized by deliberately Biblical language interwoven with actual phrases from the Gospels."<ref name="ScofieldTSEPoems">Scofield, Martin. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=Ofro_B_JrmIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false T. S. Eliot: The Poems]''. (New York: Cambridge University  Press, 1988).</ref>{{rp|p.147}}<ref>Pinion, F. B. ''A T. S. Eliot Companion''. (New York: Macmillan, 1986), 173.</ref>

The subject of Eliot's poem is drawn from the second chapter of the Gospel of Luke ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=2|verse=25|range=<U+2013>35}}), and the early Christian [[canticle]] ''[[Nunc dimittis]]'' derived from it.<ref name="SchneiderTSEPattern">Schneider, Elisabeth Wintersteen. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=u-FtaVLfRHUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false T. S. Eliot: The Pattern in the Carpet]''. (Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1975), 130<U+2013>131.</ref> In Luke's account, Simeon, an aged and devout Jew, stands in the [[Temple of Jerusalem]] at the time [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] bring the infant [[Jesus]] to be presented in the temple forty days after his birth in accordance with Jewish law and custom.  Luke states that Simeon is "waiting for the consolation of Israel" after being promised that "he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ." ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=2|verse=25|range=<U+2013>26}}) Simeon, upon seeing the child, takes him into his arms and prays, prophesizing the redemption of the world by Jesus and of suffering to come.<ref name="SchneiderTSEPattern" /> This prayer would become known later as the ''Nunc Dimittis'' from its Latin [[incipit]].<ref name="CathEncycNuncDimittis">Henry, Hugh. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11159a.htm "Nunc Dimittis (The Canticle of Simeon)"], ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', Vol. 11. (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911).

<blockquote>
<poem>
Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace : according to thy word.
For mine eyes have seen : thy salvation,
Which thou hast prepared : before the face of all people;
To be a light to lighten the Gentiles : and to be the glory of thy people Israel. ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=2|verse=29|range=<U+2013>32}})
</poem></blockquote>

The ''Nunc dimittis'' is the traditional "Gospel Canticle" of Night Prayer that is often called the ''Song of Simeon'' or ''Canticle of Simeon''. In the [[Roman Catholic]] tradition, it was used during the Office for [[Compline]], the last of the [[Canonical hours]], in the [[Liturgy of the Hours]].<ref name="CathEncycNuncDimittis" /> The Anglican tradition combined liturgy of the Catholic offices of [[Vespers]] (especially with the ''[[Magnificat]]'' canticle) and Compline (with the ''Nunc dimittis'') into [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]] when compiling the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' during the [[English Reformation]].<ref>Cummings, Brian (editor).

In 1886, Eliot's grandfather, [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], an American educator and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister, wrote a poem titled "Nunc dimittis."  Written a few months before his death, the elder Eliot's poem used the same gospel text and the poet asks, in his decline, "When may I humbly claim that kind award, / And cares and labors cease?"<ref>Eliot, William Greenleaf.

Scholars have identified allusions by Eliot to other biblical passages, including:
* "Before the stations of the mountain of desolation" in line 19 and the reference to "the fox's home" in line 15 as a reference to [[Calvary]] ([[Golgotha]]), or to {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Lamentations|chapter=5|verse=17|range=<U+2013>18}} "the mountain of zion...is desolate, the foxes walk upon it".  The fox reference is also thought to be connected to {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Mark|chapter=13|verse=14}}, and {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Mark|chapter=8|verse=20}}.<ref name="SouthamTSEPoemsGuide" />
* The stations in line 19, and the time of cords, scourges and lamentation in line 17 refers to Christ's passion and crucifixion, in particular his scourging at the orders of Pontius Pilate and the lamenting of women along the [[Via Dolorosa]] described in {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=33|verse=27|range=<U+2013>29}}.<ref name="SouthamTSEPoemsGuide" />
* "The goat's path" of line 15, is a reference to the scapegoat of {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Leviticus|chapter=16|verse=22}}.<ref name="SouthamTSEPoemsGuide" />
* That the "Fleeing from foreign faces and the foreign swords" is from prophesies of grief, hiding and pursuit in {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Isaiah|chapter=51|verse=3}}, and crucifixion events mentioned in in {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Mark|chapter=13|verse=8}}, {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Matthew|chapter=24|verse=8}}.

* Anthony Hands also sees the influence of {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Psalm|chapter=104}} on the language of the poem.<ref>Hands, Anthony. ''Sources for the Poetry of T. S. Eliot''. (Hadrian Books, 1993), 145<U+2013>147.</ref>

===Conversion===
"A Song for Simeon" is not one of Eliot's significant poems and is thus overshadowed by his comparatively more well-known works of the period, including "[[The Hollow Men]]" (1925), "[[The Journey of the Magi]]" (1927), "[[Ash Wednesday]]" (1930), and the later, more substantial ''[[Four Quartets]]'' (1943)  However, in these poems, Eliot continues the progression of his themes of alienation in a changing world, and fuses with this the tenets of his newfound faith.<ref name="MaddreyTSELitInfluences">Maddrey, Joseph. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=kNZ3xBc_620C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false The Making of T. S. Eliot: A Study of the Literary Influences]''. (Jefferson, North Carolina: MacFarland & Company, 2009), 147<U+2013>148.</ref> Literary scholar Martin Scofield states that the imagery of the poem, of the symbol of a feather and its setting amid Roman hyacinths and the winter sun conveys "a sense of wonder and fragile new life."<ref name="ScofieldTSEPoems" />{{rp|p.147}}. The Reverend Robin Griffith-Jones, an Anglican cleric, compares Eliot's image of the feather to statement by [[Hildegard of Bingen]] comparing herself "to 'a feather which lacks all weight and strength and flies through the wind'; so she was borne up by God. But Eliot<U+2019>s speaker, still waiting for the wind to blow, imagines only the death wind that will bear him away."<ref name="Griffith-JonesChurchTimes" /> According to Joseph Maddrey, "A Song for Simeon" shares themes with his more famous conversion poem <U+201C>Ash Wednesday<U+201D>, the first parts of which Eliot was writing when "A Song for Simeon" was written and published. Eliot uses the biblical story of Simeon to illustrate the "contrast between appearance and reality and humbly begs God to teach him the stillness that unifies the two."<ref name="MaddreyTSELitInfluences" />

Eliot's Ariel poems and Ash Wednesday all explore this new experience of conversion, and toward the progress of the soul.<ref name="WilliamsonTSEGuide">Williamson, George. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=wA1y00q7OJEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false A Reader's Guide to T. S. Eliot: A Poem-by-poem Analysis]''. (Syracuse University Press, 1998).</ref>{{rp|p.163}} Scofield writes that Eliot's depiction of Simeon presents "a figure to whom revelation has been granted but to whom it has come too late for this life."<ref name="ScofieldTSEPoems" />{{rp|p.147}}  But as he awaits and asks for his death Simeon's understanding, he sees the consequences of the turning of faith to this new child and his mission.  Simeon wants nothing of this "time of sorrow", adding that the fate of persecution for the consequences of faith is not for him.<ref name="WilliamsonTSEGuide" />{{rp|pp.166<U+2013>167}}

<blockquote><poem>
According to thy word.
They shall praise Thee and suffer in every generation
With glory and derision,
Light upon light, mounting the saints<U+2019> stair.
Not for me the martyrdom, the ecstasy of thought and prayer,
Not for me the ultimate vision.<ref>Eliot, T(homas). S(tearns). "A Song for Simeon" (1928), lines 25<U+2013>30.</ref> 
</poem></blockquote>

According to Eliot biographer [[Lyndall Gordon]], "Ash Wednesday" and the Ariel poems, "Eliot wonders if he does not belong to those who espouse Christianity officially without being properly committed, whose ostentatious piety is 'tainted with a self-conceit.'"<ref name="GordonTSEImperfectLife" />{{rp|p.225}} The poem is inherently tied to Eliot's religious conversion experience, and connected to Eliot's reading of Anglican divine [[Lancelot Andrewes]] during this time.  Andrewes, in an 1619 Ash Wednesday sermon, emphasized that conversion "must come from both mind and heart, thought and feeling, 'the principall and most proper act of a true turning to God.'"<ref name="MaddreyTSELitInfluences" /><ref>Andrewes, Lancelot. [http://anglicanhistory.org/lact/andrewes/v1/wednesday4.html "SERMON IV. Preached before King James, at Whitehall, on Wednesday, the Tenth of February, A.D. MDCXIX."] (on Joel ii. 12, 13.). Retrieved 24 October 2013.</ref>  Andrewes' words are channeled again, when Eliot's Simeon "sees a faith that he cannot inhabit in "the still unspeaking and unspoken Word'."<ref name="Griffith-JonesChurchTimes" /> Eliot uses the image of the winding staircase<U+2014>an image that also appears in "Ash Wednesday" which Gordon states is a direct reference to this sermon, adding that "Eliot<U+2019>s penitent ... 'turning on the winding stair', acts out the two mental turns Andrewes prescribed for a conversion: a turn that looks forward to God and a turn that looks backward to one<U+2019>s sins, sentencing oneself for the past."<ref name="GordonTSEImperfectLife" />{{rp|p.224}}

The image of a winding stair has also been tied to scenes in Dante's journey from [[Purgatory]] to Paradise in the Divine Comedy.<ref name="CavallaroVirgil">Cavallaro, Daniela. "A Song for Virgil: Dantean References in Eliot's 'A Song for Simeon'", ''Journal of Modern Literature'' 24(2) (Winter 2000/2001), 349<U+2013>352.</ref> Further, the image is thought associated with stairs as the path of mystical ascent in the writings of sixteenth-century [[Spanish mystics|Spanish mystic]] and saint [[John of the Cross]].<ref name="Griffith-JonesChurchTimes" /><ref>Unger, Leonard. ''T. S. Eliot: Moments and Patterns''. (University of Minnesota Press, 1966), 167.</ref> Eliot often alludes to this symbol in several of his poems.<ref name="ScofieldTSEPoems" />{{rp|pp.209<U+2013>211}}

Eliot's Simeon appears similar to Dante's depiction of [[Virgil]] in the ''Divine Comedy'', as "the seer who can see only so far; the precursor who cannot enter the world that he makes possible."<ref name="Griffith-JonesChurchTimes" />  Virgil, in the ''Divine Comedy'', leads Dante through Hell (''Inferno'') and Purgatory (''Purgatorio''), but cannot guide him into Paradise<U+2014>as a symbol of non-Christian philosophy and humanities, can help him no further in his approach to God.<ref>Kirkpatrick, Robin. ''Purgatorio''. (New York: Penguin, 2007), notes on Canto XXX and XXXI.</ref>  In Eliot, Simeon will never know the Christian culture he prophesizes, sensing "the birth-pangs of a world that he will never occupy."<ref name="Griffith-JonesChurchTimes" /><ref name="CavallaroVirgil" />

===Anti-Semitism===
Eliot's poems have frequently been criticized for instances of [[Anti-Semitism]]<U+2014>[[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]] against [[Jews]]. Scholar Louis Menard states that while Simeon is treated respectfully by Eliot, his characterization is "in the tradition of Christian condescension toward the virtuous heathen."<ref>Menard, Louis. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=HIHz3NAQVOUC&pg=PT70&dq=Eliot+anti-semitism&hl=en&sa=X&ei=xpZqUpgT0IuQB7_vgHg&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Simeon&f=false American Studies]''. (New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2002), n.p.</ref>  Comparatively, [[Craig Raine]], a poet and [[New College, Oxford]] [[emeritus professor]] who wrote a book-length defense of Eliot against the claims of deliberate anti-Semitism, argues that "A Song for Simeon" provides a sympathetic discussion of the Jewish diaspora.<ref>Raine, Craig. ''In Defence of T. S. Eliot''. (London/New York: Pan Macmillan, 2011); and specifically in ''T. S. Eliot''. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), 173<U+2013>174.</ref> [[University of British Columbia]] scholar John Xiros Cooper states that the accusations of anti-Semitism lodged against Eliot rest "on a few isolated lines of poetry" and a passing reference in one prose text.<ref>Cooper, John Xiros.

[[Anthony Julius]], a British lawyer who is one of Eliot's most trenchant critics on this issue, writes that "A Song for Simeon" is <U+201C>exceptional in a poetry in which elsewhere Jews are dumb. The voice, however is a disciplined one and speaks lines prepared for it...The song is ''for'', not ''of'' Simeon. Eliot gives the Jew lines that locate him, and by implication all Jews, wholly within the Christian drama. Incapable of denying its truth, but equally incapable of living that truth."<ref name="JuliusTSEAntisemitism">Julius, Anthony.

Julius' view is considered extreme by many critics,<ref name="MeyerDeshenJewishHermeneutics" />{{rp|p.203,fn.35}} and is tempered by his own argument that Eliot's anti-Semitism does not detract from his poetry and assessment that his anti-Semitism is a creative force showing rare imaginative power and empowering his art.<U+201D><ref name="JuliusTSEAntisemitism" />{{rp|pp.28,33,35}}  Literary critic and professor [[Christopher Ricks]] agreed, citing the wit and commentary of Eliot's depictions of Jews; he asserts that Eliot was at his most brilliant in his prejudice.<ref name="GordonTSEImperfectLife" />{{rp|p.104}}<ref>Ricks, Christopher.
