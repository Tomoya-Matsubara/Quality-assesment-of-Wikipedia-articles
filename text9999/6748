:''This is about the Italian city of Lecce. For the football club, see [[U.S. Lecce]].''
'''Lecce''' (102,570 inhabitants in 2004) is a city in the region of [[Apulia]] (sometimes called [[Salento]]) in the south of [[Italy]].  It is the capital of the [[province of Lecce]].

Lecce is called "La Firenze del Sud" (The [[Florence]] of the South) because of the important Baroque monuments found there. It is an important agricultural (chiefly oil and wine) and industrial centre, specialising in ceramic production.

The so-called "Lecce stone" is the city's main export.  It is very soft and malleable, making it good for sculpture.

==History==
According to legend, a city called ''Sybar'' existed at the time of the [[Trojan War]], founded by the [[Messapii]] Italic tribe. Later it was occupied by the [[Iapyges]] and conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in the [[3rd century BCE]], receiving the new name of ''Lupiae''.

Under the emperor [[Hadrian]] ([[2nd century]] AD) the city was moved 3&nbsp;km to NE, taking the name of Licea or Litium. Lecce had a theater and an amphitheater and was connected to the Hadrian Port (the current [[San Cataldo]]).

After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], Lecce was sacked by the [[Ostrogoth]] king [[Totila]] in the [[Gothic Wars (6th century)|Gothic Wars]]. It was conquered by the Byzantines in [[549]], and remained part of the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Empire]] for five centuries, with brief conquests by [[Saracen]]s, [[Lombards]], [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]] and [[Slavic people|Slav]]s.

After the [[Normans|Norman]] conquest in the 11th century, Lecce regained commercial importance, flourishing in the subsequent [[Hohenstaufen]] and [[House of Anjou|Angevine]] rule. The County of Lecce was a fief of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] from [[1053]] to[[1463]], when it was annexed directly to the crown. From the 15th century, Lecce was one of the most important cities of southern Italy, and, starting in [[1630]], it was enriched with precious Baroque monuments. To avert invasion by the Ottomans, a new line of walls and a castle were built by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], (who was also [[Holy Roman Emperor]]), in the first part of the 16th century.

In [[1656]], a [[plague]] broke out in the city, killing a thousand inhabitants.

In 1943, [[fighter aircraft]] based in Lecce helped support isolated Italian [[garrisons]] in the [[Aegean Sea]] fighting Germans during [[World War II|World War 2]].  Fortunately they were delayed by the [[Allies]], so it was too little too late.

Lecce is known for its important [[Baroque]] monuments. 
===Churches and religious buildings===
*The most important is the [[Basilica di Santa Croce (Lecce)|Church of the Holy Cross]] (''Chiesa di Santa Croce''). It was begun in [[1353]], but work was halted until [[1549]], to be completed only in [[1695]]. The church has a richly decorated fa<U+00E7>ade with animals, grotesque figures and vegetables, and a large rose window. Next to the church is the Government Palace, a former convent.
*The [[Duomo di Lecce|Duomo]] (cathedral) is also one of the most significant in Italy. It was originally built in 1144, and rebuilt in 1230. It was totally restored in the years 1659-70 by Giuseppe Zimbalo, who also built the 70&nbsp;m-high bell tower. The latter has five floors and an octagonal [[loggia]].
*The church of San Niccol<U+00F2> and Cataldo is an example of Italo-Norman architecture. It was founded by [[Tancred of Sicily]] in 1180. In 1716 the fa<U+00E7>ade was rebuilt, with the addition of numerous statues, but maintaining the fine original portal. The interior has a nave and two aisles, with ogival arcades and a dome in the centre of the nave. The frescoes on the walls are from the 15th-17th centuries.
*The Celestines' Convent (1549-1695), ewith Baroque decorations by Giuseppe Zimbalo. The courtyard was designed by Gabriele Riccardi.
*The church of the Theatines (St. Irene, built from 1591)
*Santa Maria degli Angeli
*Santa Chiara (1429-1438), rebuilt in 1687

===Other buildings===
*The Roman Amphitheatre, built in the 2nd century and situated near Sant'Oronzo Square, was able to seat more than 25,000 people.  It is now half-buried because other monuments were built above it over the centuries.  
*The column holding the statue of Saint Oronzo (Lecce's patron) was given to Lecce by the city of [[Brindisi]], because Saint Oronzo was reputed to have cured the plague in Brindisi. The column was one of a pair that marked the end of the [[Appian Way]], the main road between [[Rome]] and southern Italy.
*The ''Sedile'' was built in 1592 and was used by the local council until 1852.
*The Castle of Charles V was built in 1539-49 by Gian Giacomo dell'Acaja. It has a trapezoidal plan with angular bastions. It is attached to the [[Teatro Politeama Greco|Politeama Greco]] Opera House, inaugurated on [[November 15]], [[1884]].
