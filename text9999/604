'''King Street''' starts off as a collector road in the east-end of town in [[Dundas, Ontario|Dundas]], [[Hamilton, Ontario]], [[Canada]] beside [[Cootes Paradise]] and the [[Desjardins Canal]] at ''Olympic Drive'' and switches to an arterial road at ''York Street'' and cuts through the town of Dundas where it ends in the west-end by the [[Canadian National|CN]] railway tracks at the base of the [[Niagara Escarpment]]. It is a two-way street throughout.

Note: West of the CN railway tracks this road changes its name to Brock Road.

==History==
On January 1, 2001 the new city of Hamilton was formed from the amalgamation of the Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth and its six municipalities: Hamilton, [[Ancaster, Ontario|Ancaster]], [[Dundas, Ontario|Dundas]], [[Flamborough, Ontario|Flamborough]], [[Glanbrook, Ontario|Glanbrook]], and [[Stoney Creek, Ontario|Stoney Creek]]. Before amalgamation, the "old" City of Hamilton had 331,121 Hamiltonians divided into 100 neighbourhoods. The new amalgamated city has 490,268 people in over 200 neighbourhoods.<ref name=FOOTSTEPS>{{cite book|title=Footsteps In Time: Exploring Hamilton's heritage neighbourhoods|first=Bill |last=Manson |publisher=North Shore Publishing Inc|year=2003|isbn=1-896899-22-6}}</ref> As well, there are two King Streets found in the new city of Hamilton. One in Dundas and the other in Lower City Hamilton, ([[King Street (Hamilton, Ontario)|King Street (Hamilton)]]).

The Dundas Valley was formed by retreating [[glaciers]] more than 25,000 years ago. Dundas originally was known as [[Cootes Paradise]], named after Captain Cootes of the Kings Royal 8th Regiment and was incorporated as a town in 1847.<ref name=DUNDAS>{{cite web| title = Ontario Architecture: Dundas, (www.ontarioarchitecture.com)| url=http://www.ontarioarchitecture.com/Dundas.htm| accessdate = 2008-09-28}}</ref> 

The Carnegie Library was the first library to open in Dundas. It opened in 1910 and was funded by a donation from American industrialist, [[Andrew Carnegie]], and the citizens of Dundas. Today it plays a central role in the historic character of the Valley Town. In 1980 it became the home of the ''Dundas Art & Craft Association'', a non-profit organization.<ref name=DUNDASA>{{cite web| title = Downtown Dundas: The Carnegie Gallery, (www.downtowndundas.ca)| url=http://www.downtowndundas.ca/the-carnegie-gallery.php| accessdate = 2008-09-28}}</ref> 

Dundas was also [[proclamation|proclaimed]] the [[cactus]] capital of Canada in 1976. An summertime festival called [[Dundas Cactus Festival|The Cactus Festival]] is held in Dundas annually. When it was discovered that Dundas was already internationally recognized for the Cacti produced by the local ''Ben Veldhuis Cactus Greenhouses'', the citizens of Dundas came up with the name, <U+201C>Cactus Festival<U+201D> for a summertime festival.<ref name=DUNDASB>{{cite web| title = Dundas Cactus Festival, (official site)| url=http://www.dundascactusfest.ca/| accessdate = 2008-09-28}}</ref> 

The Desjardins Canal in pioneer days provided the essential means of transportation. Dundas, located at the head of navigation of [[Lake Ontario]] and the eastern terminus of the ''Governor's Road'', was thus in a favoured position. However, in 1823 the government authorized the construction of a [[canal]] for larger vessels through Burlington sand-bar. Since its completion would make the shallow approach through Coote's Paradise [[marsh]] inadequate, Pierre Desjardins, an enterprising settler from [[France]], formed a company in 1826 to build a canal there. Opened in August 16, 1837, it contributed greatly to the development of this region until the completion of the [[Great Western Railway]] in 1853, when the Desjardins Canal gradually fell into disuse. By the time the first [[train]] entered Dundas in 1895 commercial traffic on the canal had come to an end.<ref name=DUNDASC>{{cite web| title = Historical Dundas, (www.myhamilton.ca)| url=http://www.myhamilton.ca/myhamilton/CommunitiesAndOrganizations/Historical+Dundas.htm| accessdate = 2008-09-28}}</ref><!-- This citation applies to the paragraph in entirety -->

The canal continued to be a popular recreational spot; boats could be rented for [[fishing]], excursions and picnics to La Salle Park, Oaklands and [[Beach Boulevard (Hamilton, Ontario)|Burlington Beach]]. In 1966 Dundas Town Council granted permission for the canal basin to be filled in. On July 1, 1967 as part of Canada's Centennial Celebration Dundas' [[Centennial Park (Duundas, Hamilton, Ontario)|Centennial Park]] was officially dedicated.
