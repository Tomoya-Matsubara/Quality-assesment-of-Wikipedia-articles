Dr. '''Ram<U+00F3>n E. L<U+00F3>pez''' (born c. 1959) is a Space Physicist and author, who played an instrumental role in the implementation of a hands-on science program in the elementary and middle grades of the Montgomery County Public School System (MCPS) in Maryland. L<U+00F3>pez, also leads a research group in both space physics and science education. He is the co-author of a book on space weather titled ''Storms from the Sun'' which discusses the magnetic properties of the sun, solar wind, and how these effect the magnetosphere of earth. L<U+00F3>pez is the 2002 recipient of the prestigious Nicholson Medal for Human Outreach which recognizes the humanitarian aspect of physics and physicists,<ref name="APS">[http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/awards/nicholson.cfm American Physical Society]</ref> along with other awards.  He has also been elected a Fellow of the [http://www.aps.org Americal Physical Society] and a Fellow of the [http://www.aaas.org American Association for the Advancement of Science].

==Early years==
L<U+00F3>pez was born in Illinois to [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] parents. His father was a [[United States Army]] officer and surgeon and his mother an elementary school teacher. When he was a child his father gave him a telescope as a birthday present, and the [[Apollo 11]] moon landing on July 20, 1969 inspired him to seek an education in the field of Space Physics.<ref name="RL">[http://www.sacnas.org/beta/pdf/lopez_ramon_H.pdf Ram<U+00F3>n L<U+00F3>pez PDF]</ref> When he was in sixth grade, his father retired from the military and his family moved to [[Freeport, Illinois]], where his father set up his private medical practice. Years later, the family moved outside the town and he went to Pearl City High School. There his science teacher, who also served as an influential factor in his decision to become a scientist, taught him to do a small amount of computer programming.<ref name="RL"/>

==Education==
L<U+00F3>pez entered the [[University of Illinois]] where in 1976, and earned a B.A. in Physics in 1980. As a student he worked in the Physics Department preparing demonstrations and also wrote articles for the institution's newspaper. He was awarded a National Science Foundation minority graduate fellowship which he used to attend [[Rice University]] in [[Houston]] as a student in the Department of Space Physics and Astronomy. In 1984 he earned his [[Masters Degree|Master's]] and in 1986 a [[Ph.D.]] in [[Space physics]] (also known as space plasma physics). L<U+00F3>pez worked as a scientist for the Applied Research Corporation (on contract to the [[Johns Hopkins University]] Applied Physics Laboratory) from 1985 to 1992.<ref name="TA">[http://www.uta.edu/ra/real/editprofile.php?pid=1926 The University of Texas Arlingtion]</ref>

==Academic career==
In 1992, L<U+00F3>pez went to work for the [[University of Maryland]] at College Park and served in the following positions: Research Associate Department of Astronomy (92-93), Assistant Director for Research  East-West Space Science Center (93-94) and  Associate Research Scientist Department of Astronomy (93-99).<ref name="TA"/> He worked very closely with Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) in Maryland to help implement a hands-on science program in elementary and middle grades.<ref name="TA"/>

L<U+00F3>pez served as Director of Education and Outreach Programs of The American Physical Society from 1993<U+2013>1999 and became the Chair of the Department of Physics at the [[University of Texas]] at [[El Paso]].<ref name="NSHP">[http://www.hispanicphysicists.org/recognition/bioLopez/ National Society of Hispanic Physicists]</ref> In 2002, he was awarded the Nicholson Medal for Humanitarian Service to Science.<ref name="APS"/><ref name="FIT">[https://services.fit.edu/profiles/profile.php?value=293 Florida Institute of Technology]</ref> In 2003, he was co-Organizner of the Introductory Calculus-Based Physics Course Conference, sponsored by the American Association of Physics Teachers. He is also the Co-Director for Diversity for the Center for Integrated Space weather Modeling (CISM), a Science and Technology Center funded by the National Science Foundation. In 2004, he moved to the [[Florida Institute of Technology]] Dept. of Physics and Space Sciences and moved to the Department of Physics at the University of Texas at Arlington in 2007.<ref name="FIT"/>

==Space Research==
L<U+00F3>pez's research focuses on solar wind-magnetosphere coupling, magnetospheric storms and substorms, and space weather prediction. He has worked extensively on magnetospheric substorms, which are the episodic release of energy extracted from the solar wind and stored in the geomagnetic tail.<ref name="NSHP"/> His research studied the magnetic properties of the sun and solar wind and how these effect the magnetosphere of earth. He leads a research group that is working in both space physics and science education.<ref name="TA"/> In 2002 L<U+00F3>pez and Michael Carolwicz co-authored a popular book on space weather titled ''Storms from the Sun: The Emerging Science of Space Weather'' with Michael Carolwicz.
