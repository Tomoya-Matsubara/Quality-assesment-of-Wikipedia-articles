The '''2009 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final''' was played on September 2, 2009, at [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium]] in Washington, D.C. The match determined the winner of the [[2009 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup]], a tournament open to amateur and professional soccer teams affiliated with the [[United States Soccer Federation]]. This was the 96th edition of the oldest competition in United States soccer. The match was won by [[Seattle Sounders FC]], who defeated [[D.C. United]] 2<U+2013>1. [[Clyde Simms]] scored D.C. United's only goal. [[Fredy Montero]] and [[Roger Levesque]] scored Seattle's two goals as the club became the second [[expansion team]] in [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) history to win the tournament in their inaugural season.

D.C. United entered the tournament as the competition's defending champions. They had previously won the [[1996 U.S. Open Cup|tournament in 1996]] as well. Both Sounders FC and D.C. United had to play through two [[2009 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup qualification|qualification rounds]] for MLS teams before entering the official tournament. Prior to the final, there was a public dispute between the owners of the two clubs regarding the selection of D.C. United to host it at their home field, RFK Stadium.

As the tournament champions, Sounders FC earned a berth in the preliminary round of the [[2010<U+2013>11 CONCACAF Champions League]]. The club also received a $100,000 cash prize, while D.C. United received $50,000 as the runner-up.

{{details|2009 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup}}

The U.S. Open Cup is an annual American soccer competition open to all [[United States Soccer Federation]] affiliated teams, from amateur adult club teams to the professional clubs of [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS). Each year, Major League Soccer, which has teams that play in both the United States and Canada, is allowed to enter eight of its U.S.-based teams in the tournament. The top six MLS teams from the previous season qualify automatically, and the remaining two spots are determined by preliminary [[2009 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup qualification|qualification matches]]. The eight MLS entries begin play in the third round of the tournament.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/content/rapids-face-la-galaxy-us-open-cup-play-match |title=Rapids to face LA Galaxy in U.S. Open Cup play-in match |accessdate=April 9, 2010 |date=February 27, 2009 |publisher=Colorado Rapids Media Relations}}</ref>

===First half===
Both clubs had used a mix of reserve players and starting (first choice) players in previous tournament matches, but for the final neither team used reserve players in their starting lineups. Seattle took the field in a [[Formation (association football)#4<U+2013>4<U+2013>2 diamond or 4<U+2013>1<U+2013>2<U+2013>1<U+2013>2|4-4-2]] formation while D.C United was in a [[Formation (association football)#3<U+2013>4<U+2013>3|3-4-3]] formation.<ref name="DCU_report"/> The match kicked off at 7:37&nbsp;pm local time.<ref name="sounders_recap"/>

Five minutes into the match, D.C. United first-year player Chris Pontius had the first chance of the evening as he pushed past Sounders FC defender [[Leonardo Gonz<U+00E1>lez]] to receive a diagonal pass from [[Clyde Simms]].

United opportunity resulted in a Sounders FC counter attack, where Freddie Ljungberg's shot was saved by Wicks. The rebound rolled in front of [[Fredy Montero]], who dove feet first and kicked the ball into the goal, giving Sounders FC a 1<U+2013>0 lead.<ref name="US_report"/><ref name="sounders_recap"/> Following the goal, frustrated D.C. United goalkeeper Josh Wicks stomped on Montero's leg while he was still on the ground. After consulting with the [[Assistant referee (association football)#Fourth official|fourth official]], referee Alex Prus showed Wicks a red card for his behavior, dismissing him from the match. United's backup goalkeeper, [[Milos Kocic]], was substituted for Christian Gomez after the incident, and D.C. played with 10 men for the remainder of the match.<ref name="US_report"/>

Despite being down a man, D.C. United controlled possession of the ball as the match progressed towards full time.<ref name="DCU_report"/> Just four minutes before full time, Seattle's Sebastian Le Toux pushed D.C. defender [[Dejan Jakovic]] off the ball, [[Dribble#Association football|dribbled]] in towards goal, and then provided a centering pass to teammate Roger Levesque who scored, extending the Seattle lead to 2<U+2013>0.<ref name="US_report"/> With time ticking away, United desperately threw every man forward and managed to narrow the scoring difference to one in the 89th minute when Simms kicked home a loose ball after a Quaranta free kick.<ref name="DCU_report"/> During the five minutes of  [[stoppage time]], D.C. continued with repeated crosses and shots attempting to get an equalizer.<ref name="sounders_recap"/><ref name="DCU_report"/>
