The '''1998 U.S. Embassy bombings''' were a series of attacks that occurred on August 7, 1998, in which hundreds of people were killed in simultaneous [[truck bomb]] explosions at the United States [[embassy|embassies]] in the major [[East Africa]]n cities of [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. The attacks were linked to local members of the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]], brought [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] to the attention of the US public for the first time, and resulted in the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] placing bin Laden on its [[FBI ten most wanted fugitives|Ten Most Wanted]] list.

==Motivation and preparation==
The bombings are widely believed to have been revenge for American involvement in the extradition, and alleged torture, of four members of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] (EIJ) who had been arrested in Albania in the two months prior to the explosions.<ref>Jane Mayer, ''The Dark Side'', Doubleday. p.114</ref> Between June and July, [[Ahmad Isma'il 'Uthman Saleh]], [[Ahmad Ibrahim al-Sayyid al-Naggar]], [[Shawqi Salama Mustafa Atiya]] and [[Mohamed Hassan Tita]] were all [[rendition]]ed from Albania to Egypt, with the cooperation of the United States, accused of participating in the assassination of [[Rifaat el-Mahgoub]], as well as a later plot against the [[Khan el-Khalili]] market in Cairo.<ref name="vic">[[Victoria Advocate]], [http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3TIKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EEsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6853,2521016&dq=khan+el+khalili+market&hl=en Bombings connect to mysterious arrests], August 13, 1998</ref> The following month, a communique was issued warning the United States that a "response" was being prepared to repay them for their interference.<ref name="csisJaballah">[[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]], [http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/rss/Jaballah.pdf Summary of the Security Intelligence Report concerning Mahmoud Jaballah], February 22, 2008.

According to journalist [[Lawrence Wright]], the Nairobi operation was named after the Holy [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]]; the Dar es Salaam bombing was called Operation [[al-Aqsa]] in Jerusalem, but "neither had an obvious connection to the American embassies in Africa. Bin Laden initially said that the sites had been targeted because of the 'invasion' of Somalia; then he described an American plan to partition Sudan, which he said was hatched in the embassy in Nairobi. He also told his followers that the [[Rwandan Genocide|genocide in Rwanda]] had been planned inside the two American embassies." 

Wright concludes that bin Laden's actual goal was "to lure the United States into [[Afghanistan]], which had long been called 'The Graveyard of Empires.'"<ref>Wright, Lawrence, ''Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11,'' by Lawrence Wright, NY, Knopf, 2006, p.272</ref>  According to a 1998 memo authored by [[Mohammed Atef]] and seized by the FBI, around the time of the attacks, al-Qaeda had both an interest in and specific knowledge of negotiations between the Taliban and the American-led gas pipeline consortium [[CentGas]].<ref>{{cite web| first = Jean-Charles| last = Brisard| title = Al-Qaida monitored U.S. negotiations with Taliban over oil pipeline| publisher = [[Salon.com]]| date = June 5, 2002 | url = http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2002/06/05/memo/| accessdate = May 9, 2008 }}</ref>

In May 1998, a villa in Nairobi was purchased by one of the bombers for the purpose of accommodating bomb building in the garage. [[Ahmad Salim Swedan]] purchased a beige [[Toyota Dyna]] truck in Nairobi and a 1987 [[Nissan Atlas]] refrigeration truck in Dar es Salaam. Six metal bars were used to form a "cage" on the back of the Atlas to accommodate the bomb.<ref name="sacredcows">Benjamin, Daniel & Steven Simon. "The Age of Sacred Terror", 2002</ref>

In June 1998, KK Mohamed rented House 213 in the Illala district of Dar es Salaam, about four miles (6 km) from the U.S. Embassy. A white [[Suzuki Samurai]] was used to haul bomb components hidden in rice sacks, from House 213.

In both Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Mohammed Odeh supervised construction of two massive, 2,000-pound destructive devices. The Nairobi bomb was made of 400 to 500 cylinders of TNT (about the size of soda cans), aluminum nitrate, [[aluminum]] powder and detonating cord. The explosives were packed into some twenty specially designed wooden crates that were sealed and then placed in the bed of the trucks. Abdel Rahman ran a wire from the bomb to a set of batteries in the back of the truck cab and then to a detonator switch beneath the dashboard.<ref name="sacredcows"/> The Dar es Salaam bomb used a slightly different construction: the TNT was attached to fifteen [[oxygen]] tanks and gas canisters, and was surrounded with four bags of [[ammonium nitrate]] fertilizer and some sand bags to tamp and direct the blast.<ref>[http://books.google.ca/booksid=VkAdEJZou64C&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=500+cylinders+of+TNT+(about+the+size+of+soda+cans&source=web&ots=yKfSME9Lbc&sig=thDQJDrEXYosUBC7ovKXbXQOhMk&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result books.google.ca]{{Dead link|date=June 2009|bot=WebCiteBOT}}</ref>

The bombings were scheduled for August 7, the eighth anniversary of the arrival of American troops in Saudi Arabia, ostensibly a deliberate choice by [[Osama bin Laden]].<ref>Rohan Gunaratna 2002: Inside Al Qaeda, page 46</ref>

It is also believed that a similar attack was planned for the American Embassy in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]] but was foiled when [[Uganda]]'s Intelligence intercepted an explosives laden truck in the Eastern town of [[Iganga]]. This claim however has not been acknowledged.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Attacks and casualties==
[[Image:Kenya bombing 2.jpg|right|frame|Wreckage from the Nairobi bombing.]]
On August 7, between 10:30 am and 10:40 am local time (3:30<U+2013>3:40 am [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] time), suicide bombers in trucks laden with explosives parked outside the embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi, and almost simultaneously detonated.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://usinfo.state.gov/is/international_security/terrorism/embassy_bombings.html  | title=U.S. Embassy Bombings | publisher=U.S. Department of State website | accessdate=August 4, 2007}}</ref> In Nairobi, approximately 212 people were killed, and an estimated 4,000 wounded; in Dar es Salaam, the attack killed at least 11 and wounded 85.<ref name="newshour">{{cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/embassy_bombing/map.html | title=Online NewsHour <U+2013> African Embassy Bombings | publisher=PBS.org | accessdate=August 4, 2007}}</ref> Seismological readings analyzed after the bombs indicated energy of between 3<U+2013>17 tons of high [[explosive material]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/umrcourses/ge342/Forensic%20Seismology-revised.pdf |title=template |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}</ref> Although the attacks were directed at American facilities, the vast majority of casualties were local citizens; 12 Americans were killed:<ref>{{cite news| title = Profiles of Americans killed in Kenya embassy bombing | publisher = [[CNN.com]]| date = August 13, 1998 | url = http://www.cnn.com/US/9808/13/bomb.victims.profile/| accessdate = November 18, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061216220021/http://www.cnn.com/US/9808/13/bomb.victims.profile/ |archivedate = December 16, 2006}}</ref>

While driver Azzam drove the [[Mitsubishi Canter]] quickly toward the Nairobi embassy along with [[Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-Owhali]],<ref name="seeds">Ressa, Maria. "Seeds of Terror", 2003.</ref> local security guard Benson Okuku Bwaku was warned to open the gate immediately <U+2013> and fired upon when he refused to comply. Al-Owhali threw a [[stun grenade]] at embassy guards before exiting the vehicle and running off.<ref name="katz">Katz, Samuel M. "Relentless Pursuit: The DSS and the manhunt for the al-Qaeda terrorists", 2002</ref> [[Osama bin Laden]] later offered the explanation that it had been his intention to leap out and shoot the guards to clear a path for the truck, but that he had left his pistol in the truck and subsequently ran off.<ref name="seeds"/> As Bwaku radioed to Marine Post One for backup, the truck detonated.<ref name="katz"/> 

The explosion demolished a full half of the Embassy building and also shattered windows in the Co-operative House, a neighboring 21-floor office skyscraper. 

Meanwhile, the Atlas truck in Dar es Salaam was being driven by [[Hamdan Khalif Alal]], known as "Ahmed the German" due to his blonde hair, a former camp trainer who had arrived in the country only a few days earlier.<ref name="sacredcows"/>

Following the attacks, a group calling itself the "Liberation Army for Holy Sites" took credit for the bombings. American investigators believe the term was a cover used by [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]], who had actually perpetrated the bombing.<ref>[[National Intelligence Council|Global Briefings]], Issue 27, "Osama bin Laden tied to other Fundamentalists", September 1998.</ref>

==Aftermath and international response==
In response to the bombings, [[U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] ordered [[Bombing of Afghanistan and Sudan (August 1998)|Operation Infinite Reach]], a series of [[cruise missile]] strikes on targets in [[Sudan]] and [[Afghanistan]] on August 20, 1998, announcing the planned strike in a primetime address on American television. 
In Sudan, the missiles destroyed the [[Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory]], where 50% of Sudan's medications for both people and animals were manufactured.  The Clinton Administration claimed that there was ample evidence to prove that the plant produced chemical weapons, but a thorough investigation after the missile strikes revealed that the intelligence was unreliable.<ref>Barletta, Michael. <U+201C>Chemical Weapons in the Sudan:  Allegations and Evidence.<U+201D>  Nonproliferation Review.  Monterey Institute of International Studies 6:1 (1998):  5<U+2013>48. [http://www.intellnet.org/documents/800/050/850.htm ]</ref>

The [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1189|Resolution 1189]] condemning the attacks on the embassies.

The embassies were heavily damaged, and the one in Nairobi, Kenya had to be rebuilt. It is now located across the road from the UNWFP office, for security purposes. A few months after the attacks and subsequent American missile strikes in Afghanistan, the American energy company [[Union Oil Company of California|Unocal]] withdrew its plans for a gas pipeline through Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web| title = Business Digest | publisher = New York Times| date = December 5, 1998| url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.htmlres=9F04E3DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink| accessdate = May 9, 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

On June 1, 2007, the [[USS Chafee (DDG-90)|USS ''Chafee'']] [[Bargal raid|fired its deck guns at suspected hideouts]] of an [[Al-Qaeda]] suspect by the name of [[Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah]] who is one of the listed as responsible for the bombings, in the [[Puntland]] region of [[Somalia]]. It has not been reported if the shelling was successful or not.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18989827/ |title=From MSNBC.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=January 6, 2007 |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}</ref>
