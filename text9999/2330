'''The Chaser APEC pranks''' were a series of [[comedy|comic]] stunts that targeted the [[APEC Australia 2007|Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders Summit]] (2<U+2013>9 September 2007), in [[Sydney]], Australia. They were coordinated and performed by the Australian [[satire]] group [[The Chaser]] for the television series ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]''. The most notorious was the breach of an APEC restricted zone in the heart of [[Sydney central business district|Sydney's CBD]] on 6 September. [[Julian Morrow]] directed a fake [[Canada|Canadian]] motorcade, which was let through the restricted zone and not detected until [[Chas Licciardello]] alighted, dressed as [[Osama bin Laden]].

Although stunts that involved public locations, figures, and organisations were always a feature of the series,<ref name="primetime">{{cite news|first=Rachel|last=Browne|title=ABC pranksters slated for prime time|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/pranksters-slated-for-prime-time/2007/01/27/1169788741631.html |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=2007-01-28|accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref> the APEC pranks yielded unprecedented local and international publicity, both positive and negative.<ref name = "international">{{cite news | title=The Chaser goes global | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/the-chaser-goes-global/2007/10/29/1193618793384.html | work = [[The Age]] | date = 2007-10-30 | accessdate = 2007-11-18}}</ref> The team faced [[Criminal charge|charges]] for breaching the APEC zone, but these were dropped because in fact they had been granted police permission for their entry. Other less controversial and less publicised stunts were also shown on ''The Chaser's War on Everything'', with ratings peaking at almost three million Australian viewers for the APEC wrap-up episode.

== Background ==
=== APEC ===
{{see also|APEC Australia 2007}}
APEC Australia 2007 comprised a series of political meetings between representatives of the 21 member governments of the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]]. This culminated in a week-long summit meeting: Leaders Week, 2 to 9 September, when heads of the member governments gathered in [[Sydney, New South Wales|Sydney]].<ref>

The significance of the APEC summit called for stringent and expensive security arrangements. The Protective Security Coordination Centre, of the National Security and Criminal Justice Group from the Australian [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department]], oversaw security planning through the APEC 2007 Security Branch, formed expressly for the APEC meetings.<ref>

Many public roads in Sydney were closed, as leaders, officials, and personnel travelled in [[motorcade]]s around the city centre. Figures released by the state government at a [[Australian Senate|Senate]] committee hearing show that security measures at APEC cost [[Australian dollar|$]]170&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news | last = Dickins | first = Jim | url = http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,21837124-421,00.html | title = APEC security to cost $24 m a day | work = [[News Limited#Websites|News Limited]] | date = 2007-06-03 | accessdate = 2007-11-06}}

=== The Chaser ===
:''Further context: [[The Chaser]]''
The Chaser group's founding members were [[Charles Firth (comedian)|Charles Firth]], [[Dominic Knight]], [[Craig Reucassel]], and [[Julian Morrow]]. In 1999 they started ''[[The Chaser (newspaper)|The Chaser]]'', a fortnightly satirical newspaper. [[Chas Licciardello]], [[Andrew Hansen]], and [[Chris Taylor (comedian)|Chris Taylor]] later joined the group;<ref name="CuttingtotheChaser">{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/09/15/1095221647640.html | title=Cutting to The Chaser | work=[[The Age]] | date=2004-09-16 | first=Michael | last=Idato | accessdate=2009-02-04}}</ref> and in 2006, after various ventures in radio, stage, and television, this line-up created ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]'', its most successful program, which screened on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) station [[ABC1]]. By its second season in 2007, the show had forged a reputation for ambush-style stunts and deliberate controversy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200602/s1565449.htm|title=AWB inquiry not laughing over 'The Chaser' stunt|date=2006-02-08|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|accessdate=2009-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/chaser-star-in-court/2007/01/22/1169330808859.html |title=Chaser star leaves it to the video <ref|work=[[The Age]]|date=22 January 2007|author=Jano Gibson|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/we-are-amused/2006/08/02/1154198182710.html|title=Chaser axe stunt gets Howard going|date=2006-08-02|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=2009-02-04}}</ref>

In the following episode of ''The Chaser's War on Everything'', the team emphasised that their only realistic attempt to disguise the vehicles was the use of a [[Canadian flag]].<ref name="pre-apec" /> Taylor later said that there was "no particular reason we chose Canada, we just thought they'd be a country who the cops wouldn't scrutinise too closely, and who feasibly would only have three cars in their motorcade<U+2014>as opposed to the 20 or so gas guzzlers that Bush has brought with him".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22372709-5006505,00.html|title=11 Chaser crew held over APEC stunt|first=Warwick|last=Stanley|date=2007-09-06|work=[[News Limited#Websites|News Limited]]|accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref> There were many deliberate indications that the motorcade was not genuine, particularly on the fake credentials used by the team; members' security passes were printed with ''JOKE'', ''Insecurity'', and ''It's pretty obvious this isn't a real pass'' all clearly visible,<ref name="episode15"/> while the ''APEC 2007 Official Vehicle'' stickers included both the name of the series and the text ''This dude likes trees and poetry and certain types of carnivorous plants excite him''.<ref name="sticker">

== Aftermath ==

Following the breach of the APEC restricted area, the actions of The Chaser became the subject of intense debate among sections of the media, senior police officers, and government ministers.

=== Public response ===

Despite strong condemnation from some officials, the stunt was mostly well received by the public. A Sydney correspondent for the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] reported that the Chaser team had become "folk heroes" after the prank,<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6985775.stm | title =  Apec security leaves bitter taste in Sydney | work = BBC.co.uk |date=2007-09-09 | accessdate = 2007-09-10}}</ref> while 87% of the 28,451&nbsp;respondents to a ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' internet poll found the stunt "funny".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/polls/national/results.html|title=Rate the Chaser Online Pollstunt|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=2007-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/apec/chaser-juggernaut-breaches-global-awareness/2007/09/07/1188783496428.html|title=Chaser juggernaut breaches global awareness|accessdate=2009-02-04|date=2007-09-08|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>

However, the ABC received more than 250&nbsp;complaints, outweighing the 177 positive submissions.<ref name = "public"/> A spokesperson for the national broadcaster said that the results were misleading because people who enjoyed the show typically do not make comments. Around the country, around 80% of callers to [[talk radio|talkback radio]] were supportive; and one third of all calls regarding APEC mentioned the stunt.<ref name = "public">{{cite news | url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2007/09/10/1189276635220.html | title = Mixed response to Chaser's APEC antics | work = [[The Age]] | date = 2007-09-11 | accessdate = 2007-11-20}}</ref>

=== Political reactions ===

There were many critics among politicians and officials. Representatives of the police force in Sydney were among the most severe, and New South Wales Police Commissioner [[Andrew Scipione]], the head of APEC's lead security agency, was angered because the comedians could have been shot by police [[sniper]]s, who were "clearly&nbsp;... there because they mean business. They're not there for show."<ref name = "negative1">{{cite news | url = http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22388125-29277,00.html?CMP=KNC-google | title = Chasers release new prank video | work = [[News Limited#Websites|News Limited]] | date = 2007-09-09 | accessdate = 2007-11-06}}</ref> In response, Licciardello expressed his faith in the snipers' professional ability: "They are highly trained, competent people and they're not going to shoot people if they're in an Osama bin Laden costume if they clearly don't pose a threat".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,22400896-952,00.html|work=[[The Courier Mail]]|title=Chaser team slam top cop over sniper claims|first=Marcus|last=Casey|accessdate=2008-02-17|date=2007-09-11}}</ref>

Many politicians, mostly from the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government of New South Wales, reacted to the security breach with concern and unease. Police Minister [[David Campbell (Australian politician)|David Campbell]] expressed disappointment and concern over the stunt, arguing that there were "21 world leaders arriving in the city at the one time and it needs to be taken seriously".<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/06/2026199.htm | title = Police Minister not impressed over Chaser stunt | work = [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] | date = 2007-09-06 | accessdate = 2007-11-07}}</ref> [[Premier of New South Wales|New South Wales Premier]] [[Morris Iemma]] said that while he was a fan of the show, those involved would have to face the full force of the law.<ref name = "negative1" /> Federal [[List of Australian Leaders of the Opposition|Opposition Leader]] [[Kevin Rudd]], also from the Labor Party, voiced similar concerns, saying that "I'm a fan of The Chaser&nbsp;... but I think these guys have crossed the line."<ref name = "sticker" />

[[Alexander Downer]], the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs]] in Australia's [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] government, was amused when asked to comment on the incident.<ref name="sticker" /> He said the arrests proved that the security system had functioned properly, adding that "whatever you think of the humour of The Chaser&nbsp;... they were clearly not going to harm anybody in a physical way".<ref name="pre-apec" /> The incident also generated debate during [[question time]] in the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/view_document.aspx?id=2495117&table=HANSARDS |title=SavedQuery |work=ParlInfo|date= |accessdate=2008-10-31}}</ref>

=== International recognition ===

The APEC security breach captured international attention and acclaim. A local newspaper in Canada saw the humorous side, despite the pranksters posing as Canadian officials. In the United States media reviews were mixed. Newsreaders from American networks and the British Broadcasting Corporation, [[Fox News Channel]], [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company ]], and [[CBS|CBS Broadcasting]] either "raised their eyebrows" or "had smiles on their faces over the stunt".<ref>

</ref> After the high ratings for the episode and international recognition derived from the stunt, the program began screening in countries such as [[Israel]], South Korea, and New Zealand; and  other countries, especially in the [[Middle East]], began negotiating with the ABC.<ref name="international" />
The stunt was named the Best Television Moment at the [[MTV Australia Awards#2008|2008 MTV Australia Awards]].<ref name="policeunapologetic"/>

=== Current affairs ===

On 6 September 2007, the tabloid [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] program ''[[Today Tonight]]'' from the [[Seven Network]] aired a story headed "Dangerous Fools", specifically devoted to the APEC stunt.<ref name = "fools" /> Host [[Anna Coren]] asserted that The Chaser were wasting taxpayers' money, and will "need more of those funds [in legal costs to the government-funded ABC] to defend their actions in court".<Ref name=fools/> Coren claimed that the ABC chiefs were too arrogant to reply to the program's inquiries. A media commentator interviewed in the report condemned the APEC stunt as "over the top", and said he could not see the humour of it. A security expert presented his view, saying that there was a serious risk of injury, not just to the crew members, but to onlookers outside the security zone, even though the breach was discovered by police officers well inside the prohibited area.<ref name = "fools" />

''Today Tonight''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s broadcast criticised The Chaser's approach to the APEC event, describing the stunt as "[stretching] the boundaries yet again". The program quoted Morrow's radio comments about wanting "a stunt that can really hit the headlines across the world" as evidence of irresponsibility.<ref name="fools" /> The show also presented [[Craig Reucassel]] from The Chaser, responding to questions and claiming that the comedians were "hardly sorry" for their actions. Ironically, the report was made by [[David Richardson (Australian)|Dave "Sluggo" Richardson]], notorious for his hoax  story "[[Today Tonight#Christopher Skase controversy|In Barcelona Tonight]]"; but Richardson, unlike The Chaser crew, had not gone through roadblocks in his stunt.<ref name = "fools" />

The rival [[Nine Network]]'s current affairs program ''[[A Current Affair]]'' also aired a report.<ref name="aca"/> A Nine cameraman had seen the stunt unfold, and managed to capture it on film. The report revolved around the incompetence of the police and security personnel, in contrast to ''Today Tonight's'' criticism of The Chaser's actions, and spoke of the group executing "their grandest gag yet", bringing together "the world's most powerful man and the world's most wanted, in the same place, at the same time",<ref name="aca">''Chaser Busted'' Originally published on ''[[A Current Affair]]'', ''[[Nine Network]]''. Date: 6 September 2007.</ref> referring to US president Bush and terrorist bin Laden.

=== Legal action ===

After their arrest, questioning, and interrogation by police, all eleven participants in the stunt (eight production members of ''The Chaser's War on Everything'' and three hired drivers) were charged with "entering a restricted area without special justification" under the ''APEC Meeting (Police Powers) Act 2007''.<ref name="charge" /> All eleven were granted bail, on the condition that they refrain from entering any of the APEC secured areas, and ordered to appear at the Downing Centre Local Court on 4 October 2007.<ref name="bail07ed"/> Those charged were Esteban Alegria, Nathan Earl, Giles Hardie, Lauren Howard, Mark Kordi, Chas Licciardello, Geoffrey Lye, Alexander Morrow, Julian Morrow, Rodrigo Pena, and Benson Simpson.<ref name="dopp"/> After numerous adjournments,<ref>{{cite web

The DPP argued that it was never the intention of The Chaser to breach security and that they were allowed into the restricted area only because of the mistakes of the police. The laws enacted for the summit meant that entry into the restricted zone needed justification, which could include police permission. The DPP stated that by waving The Chaser through, they had granted permission to be in the restricted zone. A further defence was available: all members charged, except Morrow, could argue that they were present for work-related purposes, and part of their employment was to be with Morrow, who was directing the stunt.<ref name="dopp"/>

=== Show ratings ===

With all the hype and media attention directed at this stunt, the following episode of ''The Chaser's War on Everything'' on 12 September 2007, initially intended to be called ''The Chaser's War on APEC'',<ref name = "public" /> was the program's highest-rating ever. In Australia there was a total of 2.981&nbsp;million viewers: 2.245&nbsp;million viewers in the [[List of Australian capital cities|capital cities]], and 736,000 regional viewers.<ref>

After the successful breach of APEC security, the comedians expressed their bewilderment at the incompetence of the security forces. Morrow and Reucassel went on radio to augment the initial reactions they had aired on the 12 September episode of ''The Chaser's War on Everything''.<ref name="radiointerview"/> Morrow pointed out that while they did extensive planning for the stunt, the one thing they "didn't plan for was success"; the participants were confused by the unexpected permission to enter the area, and unsure how to proceed; they clearly sensed danger, but the atmosphere was actually very quiet and subdued.<ref name="radiointerview">{{cite interview| last          = ''MyTalk.com.au''| subject       = Julian Morrow| subjectlink   = Julian Morrow| subject2      = Craig Reucassel| subjectlink2  = Craig Reucassel| title         = The Chaser boys, Julian Morrow and Craig Reucassel discuss the release of their new book| program       = 3AW| date          = 2| year          = 2007| month         = 11}}<!-- This interview was origianlly online at http://www.mytalk.com.au/aspx/pages/mediaplayer.aspx?t=audio&w=3994 listened by User:SpecialWindler and User:Jasewese (per talk page I suggested this to Jasewese, and edit history shows Jasewese created this section), archive.org (http://web.archive.org/web/20071103012120/http://www.mytalk.com.au/aspx/pages/mediaplayer.aspx?t=audio&w=3994) shows the website, but the media file does not play. --></ref> 

Licciardello stated that they did not know they had entered the red zone, and "we had the advice of our lawyers ring in our ears; 'Do NOT go into the red zone.

In addition to The Chaser's major APEC security breach, the team performed stunts at the APEC Summit that received far less coverage in the media.

;Pantomime horse at APEC protests
On 5 September 2007, [[Chris Taylor (comedian)|Chris Taylor]], mounted on a [[pantomime horse]], confronted police officers, who were on foot, and asked them if they needed any reinforcements against APEC protesters. When his offer was refused, Taylor took the horse for a stroll anyway, and was met by amused onlookers and media personnel.<ref name="episode15" /> He was later asked by police officers to remove his clothing for examination, since it resembled a police uniform; but no charges of impersonating police were laid.<ref>{{cite news | title = Chaser team charged | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/apec/chaser-team-charged/2007/09/06/1188783378804.html | work = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = 2007-09-06 | accessdate = 2007-11-11}}</ref> The reference was to the [[2007 Australian equine influenza outbreak|horse flu outbreak]], which forced police officers to face APEC protesters on foot.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22321426-601,00.html | title = Mounted patrols for APEC cancelled | work = [[The Australian]] | date=2007-08-28 | accessdate=2007-08-28}}</ref> This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode.<ref name="episode15" />

;Canadian cardboard motorcade
On 7 September 2007, following the security breach on the previous day, Taylor, Reucassel, [[Dominic Knight]] and their film crew were detained and questioned over a follow-up stunt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/07/2027186.htm|title=Police question Chasers over second APEC stunt|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=10 September 2007|accessdate=2007-10-15}}</ref> This incident involved running near and attempting to enter the APEC protected zone dressed in cardboard cars mounted with Canadian flags, a reference to the flags' earlier use to disguise the successful breach by the real motorcade. Police had no choice but to release all members involved in this stunt, as they were outside the prohibited area.<ref>

;Clothing for APEC photo
Shortly before 5 September 2007, Reucassel approached several APEC security personnel and offered a selection of clothing, inspired by the traditional official photograph of all the attending leaders wearing matching outfits.<ref name = "episode14">{{cite video

;Assassination of Hu Jintao
Shortly before 12 September 2007, as part of [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] [[Hu Jintao]]'s visit to Australia, Reucassel went to the Chinese Consulate and asked for them to [[Capital punishment in the People's Republic of China#Procedure|prepay]] the bullets he was going to use to assassinate Hu, in reference to China's policy of requiring the family of the condemned prisoner to pay for bullets used in their relative's execution.<ref name="episode15" /> This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode.<ref name="episode15" />

;APEC security checks
Shortly before 5 September 2007, Licciardello, who was dressed as a police officer, performed random security checks and procedures on members of the public to demonstrate the glorification of the tough APEC security measures.<ref name="episode14" /> These procedures included random [[frisking]], taking hair samples, telling [[tram]] riders in [[Melbourne]] to stand and turn their heads, and erecting secure areas in public toilets and near escalators. When Licciardello was approached by real security officers, he said that all of these measures were "classified".<ref name="episode14" /> This stunt aired on the 5 September 2007 episode.<ref name="episode14" />

;Radio prank call
On 10 September 2007,<ref name="15comm"/> Licciardello rang a [[talk radio|talkback radio station]] pretending to be someone else, and complained about the stunt, claiming that it was stupid and anyone involved at the ABC, including [[Kerry O'Brien (journalist)|Kerry O'Brien]], should be jailed for ten years.<ref name="episode15" /> This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode, and Licciardello said he wished he had made the call on the evening of the security breach because talkback radio discussion would not have already died down.<ref name="episode15" /><ref name="15comm"/>

;RSL attempted entry
Sometime between 6 and 12 September 2007, Licciardello and Morrow tried to enter a [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned and Services League]] (RSL) building using the same fake passes that had gained them entry to the restricted area. The manager did not let them enter, which was proof, according to the team, that "RSL's are harder to get into than APEC".<ref name="episode15" /> This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode.<ref name="episode15" /> However, in the DVD commentary of the episode, The Chaser stated that they were actually let into many RSL buildings with the fake passes. They claimed that acting as if one is meant to be present is usually enough.<ref name="15comm">{{cite video

;Rival fireworks show
On 8 September 2007, Chaser members Taylor and [[Andrew Hansen]] launched a competing fireworks display to coincide with the official APEC fireworks display, which was only to be viewed by the APEC officials.<ref>
{{cite news | url = http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22305629-5013719,00.html | title = Sydneysiders told not to attend APEC fireworks display | work = [[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]] | date=2007-08-25 | accessdate = 2007-11-06}}
</ref> The two displays were close to each other, with the official fireworks launched at the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], while the rival fireworks were fired from [[Woolwich, New South Wales|Woolwich]].<ref name="15comm"/> The team lit up a large screen with the text ''Screw APEC''.<ref name="episode15" /> This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode; and in the DVD commentary on the episode Morrow said the display was hard to orchestrate and not cheap.<ref name="episode15" /><ref name="15comm"/>

;Animals at Taronga Zoo
Shortly before 5 September 2007, Reucassel, equipped with suitable costumes, went into [[Taronga Zoo]] and impersonated real Australian native animals,<ref name="episode14" /> in reference to the temporary relocation of some animals for private viewing by spouses of APEC leaders.<ref>

</ref> This stunt aired on the 5 September 2007 episode.<ref name="episode14" />

;Proposed nautical red zone breach
A planned stunt that was never executed was an attempt to breach the [[nautical]] red zone.<ref name="15comm"/> Morrow and Licciardello were to perform it after the motorcade stunt on 6 September 2007; but it never went ahead, since they were detained by police after the surprising success of the earlier stunt. The plan was to breach APEC nautical security in "funny" boats, such as a [[gondola]].<ref name="15comm"/>
