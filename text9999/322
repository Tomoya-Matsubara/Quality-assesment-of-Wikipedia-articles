'''United States Bankruptcy Courts''' are legislative courts which were created under Article I of the Constitution. They function as units of the [[United States district courts|district courts]] and have [[subject-matter jurisdiction]] over [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy cases]]. Because the federal district courts have original and exclusive jurisdiction over all cases arising under the bankruptcy code, (see {{uscsub|28|1334|a}}), bankruptcy cases cannot be filed in [[State court (United States)|state court]]. Each of the 94 federal judicial districts handles bankruptcy matters. The current system of bankruptcy courts was created by [[United States Congress]] in 1979.

The bankruptcy judges in each judicial district in regular active service constitute a "unit" of the applicable [[United States district court]] (see {{USCode|28|151}}). The bankruptcy judge is appointed for a term of 14 years by the [[United States court of appeals]] for the circuit in which the applicable district is located (see {{USCode|28|152}}).

Technically, the United States district courts have subject matter jurisdiction over bankruptcy matters (see {{uscsub|28|1334|a}}). However, each such district court may, by order, "refer" bankruptcy matters to the bankruptcy court (see {{uscsub|28|157|a}}). As a practical matter, most district courts have a standing "reference" order to that effect, so that all bankruptcy cases in that district are handled, at least initially, by the bankruptcy court. In unusual circumstances, a district court may in a particular case <U+201C>withdraw the reference<U+201D> (i.e., take the case or a particular proceeding within the case away from the bankruptcy court and decide the matter itself) under {{uscsub|28|157|d}}.

The overwhelming majority of all proceedings in bankruptcy are held before a United States bankruptcy judge, whose decision in all matters is final, subject to [[appeal]]s to the district court.  In some judicial circuits, appeals may be taken to a [[Bankruptcy Appellate Panel]] ("BAP").  

The [[Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure]] (FRBP) govern [[Legal procedure|procedure]] in the U.S. bankruptcy courts.

Decisions of the Bankruptcy Courts are not collected and published in an official [[Law report|reporter]] produced by the government. Instead, the ''de facto'' official source for opinions of the Bankruptcy Courts is ''West's Bankruptcy Reporter'', published privately by [[Thomson West]].
