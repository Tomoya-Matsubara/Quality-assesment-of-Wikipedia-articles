The '''Kendall Cottage''' is a historic house on Silver Lake Road in [[Harrisville, New Hampshire]].  The main (left side) portion of the 1 1/2 story Cape style house was built in 1798; the right-hand portion, a near copy of the left side, was added c. 1930.  The house is one of a few surviving vernacular hill farm houses in Harrisville; it was also the home of one the town's first selectmen.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/86003251.pdf|title=NRHP nomination for Kendall Cottage|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-04-17}}</ref>
