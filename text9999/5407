{{Indian Constitution TOC}}
Rights which are considered essential or fundamental for the well-being of a person are called Fundamental Rights.The '''Fundamental Rights in India''' enshrined in the Part III of the [[Constitution of India]] guarantee [[civil liberty|civil liberties]] such that all Indians can lead their lives in peace and harmony as [[Indian nationality law|citizens of India]]. These include individual rights common to most [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], such as equality before law, [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of expression|expression]], freedom of association and peaceful assembly, freedom to practice religion, and the right to constitutional remedies for the protection of civil rights by means of [[writ]]s such as [[habeas corpus]]. Violations of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the [[Indian Penal Code]], subject to discretion of the [[judiciary]]. The Fundamental Rights are defined as basic [[Human rights|human freedoms]] which every Indian citizen has the right to enjoy for a proper and harmonious development of personality. These rights universally apply to all citizens, irrespective of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], place of birth, [[religion]], [[caste]], [[creed]], [[Coloured|colour]] or [[Gender|sex]]. They are enforceable by the [[court]]s, subject to certain restrictions. The Rights have their origins in many sources, including [[Bill of Rights 1689|England's Bill of Rights]], the [[United States Bill of Rights]] and [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|France's Declaration of the Rights of Man]]. 

The six fundamental rights are:<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Fundamental Rights]].</ref>
# Right to equality
# Right to freedom
# Right against exploitation
# Right to [[Status of religious freedom in India|freedom of religion]]
# Cultural and educational rights
# Right to constitutional remedies

[[Human rights|Rights]] literally mean those freedoms which are essential for personal good as well as the good of the community. The rights guaranteed under the [[Constitution of India]] are fundamental as they have been incorporated into the ''Fundamental Law of the Land'' and are enforceable in a court of law. However, this does not mean that they are absolute or that they are immune from [[Constitution of India#Amendments|Constitutional amendment]].<ref name="pgA23">Tayal, B.B. & Jacob, A. (2005), ''Indian History, World Developments and Civics'', pg. A-23</ref>

Fundamental rights for Indians have also been aimed at overturning the inequalities of pre-independence social practices. Specifically, they have also been used to abolish [[untouchability]] and hence prohibit discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. They also forbid trafficking of human beings and [[Unfree labour|forced labour]]. They also protect cultural and educational rights of ethnic and religious [[minorities]] by allowing them to preserve their languages and also establish and administer their own education institutions.

== Genesis ==
{{seealso|Indian independence movement}}

The development of constitutionally guaranteed fundamental human rights in India was inspired by historical examples such as [[Bill of Rights 1689|England's Bill of Rights]] (1689), the [[United States Bill of Rights]] (approved on 17 September 1787, final ratification on 15 December 1791) and [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|France's Declaration of the Rights of Man]] (created during the [[French Revolution|revolution of 1789]], and ratified on 26 August 1789).<ref name="pgA23"/> Under the educational system of [[British Raj]], students were exposed to ideas of democracy, human rights and European political history. The Indian student community in England was further inspired by the workings of [[parliamentary democracy]] and British political parties.

In 1919, the [[Rowlatt Acts]] gave extensive powers to the British government and police, and allowed indefinite arrest and detention of individuals, warrant-less searches and seizures, restrictions on public gatherings, and intensive censorship of media and publications. The public opposition to this act eventually led to [[Non-Cooperation Movement|mass campaigns of non-violent civil disobedience]] throughout the country demanding guaranteed civil freedoms, and limitations on government power. Indians, who were seeking independence and their own government, were particularly influenced by the independence of Ireland and the development of the Irish constitution. Also, the directive principles of state policy in Irish constitution were looked upon by the people of India as an inspiration for the independent India's government to comprehensively tackle complex social and economic challenges across a vast, diverse nation and population. 

In 1928, the [[Nehru Report|Nehru Commission]] composing of representatives of Indian political parties proposed constitutional reforms for India that apart from calling for [[dominion]] status for India and elections under universal suffrage, would guarantee rights deemed fundamental, representation for religious and ethnic minorities, and limit the powers of the government. In 1931, the [[Indian National Congress]] (the largest Indian political party of the time) adopted resolutions committing itself to the defense of fundamental civil rights, as well as socio-economic rights such as the [[minimum wage]] and the abolition of [[untouchability]] and [[serfdom]].<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> Committing themselves to [[socialism]] in 1936, the Congress leaders took examples from the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union|constitution of the erstwhile USSR]], which inspired the fundamental duties of citizens as a means of collective patriotic responsibility for national interests and challenges.


When India obtained independence on 15 August 1947, the task of developing a constitution for the nation was undertaken by the [[Constituent Assembly of India]], composing of elected representatives under the presidency of [[Rajendra Prasad]]. While members of Congress composed of a large majority, Congress leaders appointed persons from diverse political backgrounds to responsibilities of developing the constitution and national laws.<ref name="constitution">{{cite web

}}</ref> Notably, [[Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar]] became the chairperson of the drafting committee, while [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]] became chairpersons of committees and sub-committees responsible for different subjects. A notable development during that period having significant effect on the Indian constitution took place on 10 December 1948 when the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and called upon all member states to adopt these rights in their respective constitutions.

The Fundamental Rights were included in the Ist Draft Constitution (February 1948), the IInd Draft Constitution (17 October 1948) and the IIIrd and final Draft Constitution (26 November 1949), being prepared by the [[Constitution of India#History|Drafting Committee]].

== Significance and characteristics ==

The Fundamental Rights were included in the constitution because they were considered essential for the development of the personality of every individual and to preserve human dignity. The writers of the constitution regarded democracy of no avail if civil liberties, like freedom of speech and religion were not recognized and protected by the State.<ref name=State>The term "State" includes all authorities within the territory of India. It includes the [[Government of India]], the [[Parliament of India]], the Government and legislature of the [[states of India]]. It also includes all local or other authorities such as Municipal Corporations, Municipal Boards, District Boards, [[Panchayat]]s etc. To avoid confusion with the term [[states and territories of India]], State (encompassing all the authorities in India) has been capitalized and the term [[States of India|state]] (referring to the state governments) is in lowercase.</ref> According to them, "democracy" is, in essence, a government by opinion and therefore, the means of formulating public opinion should be secured to the people of a democratic nation. For this purpose, the constitution guaranteed to all the citizens of India the freedom of speech and expression and various other freedoms in the form of the Fundamental Rights.<ref>{{cite book

{{Rights}}
All people, irrespective of race, religion, caste or sex, have been given the right to move the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] and the [[High Courts of India|High Courts]] for the enforcement of their Fundamental Rights. It is not necessary that the aggrieved party has to be the one to do so. Poverty stricken people may not have the means to do so and therefore, in the public interest, anyone can commence litigation in the court on their behalf. This is known as "[[Public interest litigation]]".<ref>{{cite web

}} This was the case where [[Public interest litigation]] was introduced (date of ruling 15 December 1995).</ref> In some cases, High Court judges have acted on their own on the basis of newspaper reports. 

These Fundamental Rights help not only in protection but also the prevention of gross violations of human rights. They emphasize on the fundamental unity of India by guaranteeing to all citizens the access and use of the same facilities, irrespective of background. Some Fundamental Rights apply for persons of any nationality whereas others are available only to the citizens of India. The right to life and personal liberty is available to all people and so is the right to freedom of religion. On the other hand, [[Freedom of speech|freedoms of speech]] and [[Freedom of expression|expression]] and freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country are reserved to citizens alone, including [[Non-resident Indian|non-resident Indian citizens]].<ref>Tayal, B.B. & Jacob, A. (2005), ''Indian History, World Developments and Civics'', pg.

Fundamental rights primarily protect individuals from any arbitrary state actions, but some rights are enforceable against individuals.<ref>{{cite web

}} This was the case where fundamental rights were enforced against private individuals (date of ruling 15 December 1995).</ref> For instance, the Constitution abolishes [[untouchability]] and also prohibits ''[[Unfree labour|begar]]''. These provisions act as a check both on state action as well as the action of private individuals. However, these rights are not absolute or uncontrolled and are subject to reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection of general welfare. They can also be selectively curtailed. The Supreme Court has ruled<ref>[[Basic structure#The Kesavananda Case of 1973|Kesavananda Bharati vs. The State of Kerala''; AIR 1973 S.C. 1461, (1973) 4 SCC 225]] &mdash; In what became famously known as the "Fundamental Rights case", the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] decided that the basic structure of the [[Constitution of India]] was unamendable.</ref> that all provisions of the Constitution, including Fundamental Rights can be amended. However, the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] cannot alter the basic structure of the constitution. Features such as [[secularism]] and [[democracy]] fall under this category. Since the Fundamental Rights can only be altered by a [[Constitution of India#Amendments|constitutional amendment]], their inclusion is a check not only on the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]], but also on the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] and state legislatures.<ref>Tayal, B.B. & Jacob, A. (2005), ''Indian History, World Developments and Civics'', pg. A-24</ref>

A [[State of Emergency in India|state of national emergency]] has an adverse effect on these rights. Under such a state, the rights conferred by Article 19 (freedoms of speech, assembly and movement, etc.) remain suspended. Hence, in such a situation, the legislature may make laws which go against the rights given in Article 19. Also, the [[President of India|President]] may by order suspend the right to move court for the enforcement of other rights as well.

== Right to equality ==
Right to equality is an important right provided for in Articles 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of the constitution. It is the principal foundation of all other rights and liberties, and guarantees the following:

*Equality before law: Article 14 of the constitution guarantees that all citizens shall be equally protected by the laws of the country. It means that the State<ref name=State/> cannot discriminate against a citizen on the basis of caste, creed, colour, sex, religion or place of birth.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 14 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> According to the ''Electricity Act'' of 26 January 2003 the Parliament has the power to create special courts<ref>{{cite web

*Social equality and equal access to public areas: Article 15 of the constitution states that no person shall be discriminated on the basis of caste, colour, language etc. Every person shall have equal access to public places like public parks, museums, wells, bathing ghats and temples etc. However, the State may make any special provision for women and children. Special provisions may be made for the advancements of any socially or educationally backward class or [[scheduled castes]] or [[scheduled tribes]].<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 15 Fundamental Rights]].</ref>

*Equality in matters of public employment: Article 16 of the constitution lays down that the State cannot discriminate against anyone in the matters of employment. All citizens can apply for government jobs. There are some exceptions. The Parliament may enact a law stating that certain jobs can only be filled by applicants who are domiciled in the area. This may be meant for posts that require knowledge of the locality and language of the area. The State may also reserve posts for members of backward classes, scheduled castes or scheduled tribes which are not adequately represented in the services under the State to bring up the weaker sections of the society. Also, there a law may be passed which requires that the holder of an office of any religious institution shall also be a person professing that particular religion.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 16 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> According to the ''Citizenship (Amendment) Bill'', 2003, this right shall not be conferred to [[Indian nationality law#Overseas citizenship of India|Overseas citizens of India]].<ref name="OCI">{{cite web

*Abolition of untouchability: Article 17 of the constitution abolishes the practice of [[untouchability]]. Practice of untouchability is an offense and anyone doing so is punishable by law.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 17 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> The ''Untouchability Offences Act'' of 1955 (renamed to ''Protection of Civil Rights Act'' in 1976) provided penalties for preventing a person from entering a place of worship or from taking water from a tank or well.

<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Bratnal.jpg|thumb|100px|''Bharat Ratna'' medallion.]] -->
*Abolition of Titles: Article 18 of the constitution prohibits the State from conferring any titles. Citizens of India cannot accept titles from a foreign State.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 18 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> The British government had created an aristocratic class known as ''Rai Bahadurs'' and ''Khan Bahadurs'' in India &mdash; these titles were also abolished. However, [[Military rank|Military]] and [[Academic rank|academic]] distinctions can be conferred on the citizens of India. The awards of ''[[Bharat Ratna]]'' and ''[[Padma Vibhushan]]'' cannot be used by the recipient as a title and do not, accordingly, come within the constitutional prohibition".<ref>{{cite book

== Right to freedom ==
The Constitution of India contains the right to freedom, given in articles 19, 20, 21 and 22, with the view of guaranteeing individual rights that were considered vital by the framers of the constitution. The right to freedom in Article 19 guarantees the following six freedoms:<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 19 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> 

*[[Freedom of speech]] and [[Freedom of expression|expression]], which enable an individual to participate in public activities. The phrase, "[[freedom of press]]" has not been used in Article 19, but freedom of expression includes freedom of press. Reasonable restrictions can be imposed in the interest of public order, security of State, decency or morality. 

*Freedom to assemble peacefully without arms, on which the State can impose reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order and the sovereignty and integrity of India.

*Freedom to form associations or unions on which the State can impose reasonable restrictions on this freedom in the interest of public order, morality and the sovereignty and integrity of India.

*Freedom to move freely throughout the territory of India though reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right in the interest of the general public, for example, restrictions may be imposed on movement and travelling, so as to control [[epidemic]]s.

*Freedom to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India which is also subject to reasonable restrictions by the State in the interest of the general public or for the protection of the [[scheduled tribes]] because certain safeguards as are envisaged here seem to be justified to protect indigenous and tribal peoples from exploitation and coercion.<ref name="MVPylee">{{cite book

*Freedom to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business on which the State may impose reasonable restrictions in the interest of the general public. Thus, there is no right to carry on a business which is dangerous or immoral. Also, professional or technical qualifications may be prescribed for practicing any profession or carrying on any trade.

The constitution also guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, which in turn cites specific provisions in which these rights are applied and enforced:

*Protection with respect to conviction for offences is guaranteed in the right to life and personal liberty. According to Article 20, no one can be awarded punishment which is more than what the law of the land prescribes at that time. This legal axiom is based on the principle that no criminal law can be made retrospective, that is, for an act to become an offence, the essential condition is that it should have been an offence legally at the time of committing it. Moreover, no person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. "Compulsion" in this article refers to what in law is called "[[Duress]]" (injury, beating or unlawful imprisonment to make a person do something that he does not want to do). This article is known as a safeguard against self incrimination. The other principle enshrined in this article is known as the principle of [[double jeopardy]], that is, no person can be convicted twice for the same offence, which has been derived from Anglo Saxon law. This principle was first established in the [[Magna Carta]].<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 20 Fundamental Rights]].</ref>

*Protection of life and personal liberty is also stated under right to life and personal liberty. Article 21 declares that no citizen can be denied his life and liberty except by law.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 21 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> This means that a person's life and personal liberty can only be disputed if that person has committed a crime. However, the [[right to life]] does not include the [[right to die]], and hence, [[suicide]] or an attempt thereof, is an offence. (Attempted suicide being interpreted as a crime has seen many debates. The Supreme Court of India gave a landmark ruling in the year 1994. The court repealed section 309 of the Indian penal code, under which people attempting suicide could face prosecution and prison terms of up to one year.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nandan G |title=Indian grants right to suicide  |journal=BMJ |volume=308 |issue=6941 |pages=1392 |month=May |year=1994 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/308/6941/1392}}</ref> In the year 1996 however another Supreme Court ruling nullified the earlier one. <ref>[http://www.geradts.com/anil/ij/vol_007_no_001/papers/paper003.html Paper 3: Abolition and Restoration of Section 309 IPC <U+2013> an overview by BR Sharma, A Sharma, D Harish: Anil Aggrawal's Internet Journal of Forensic Medicine: Vol. 7, No. 1 (January - June 2006)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>) "Personal liberty" includes all the freedoms which are not included in Article 19 (that is, the six freedoms). The right to travel abroad is also covered under "personal liberty" in Article 21.<ref>''[[Maneka Gandhi]] v. Union of India''; AIR 1978 S.C. 597, (1978).</ref>

*In 2002, through the 86th Amendment Act, Article 21(A) was incorporated. It made the right to primary education part of the right to freedom, stating that the State would provide free and compulsory education to children from six to fourteen years of age.<ref name="86amact">[http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend86.htm 86th Amendment Act, 2002].</ref> Six years after an amendment was made in the Indian Constitution, the union cabinet cleared the Right to Education Bill in 2008. It is now soon to be tabled in Parliament for approval before it makes a fundamental right of every child to get free and compulsory education. <ref name="right to education bill">[http://www.indg.gov.in/primary-education/policiesandschemes/right-to-education-bill right to education bill].</ref>

*Rights of a person arrested under ordinary circumstances is laid down in the right to life and personal liberty. No one can be arrested without being told the grounds for his arrest. If arrested the person has the right to defend himself by a [[lawyer]] of his choice. Also an arrested citizen has to be brought before the nearest [[magistrate]] within 24 hours. The rights of a person arrested under ordinary circumstances are not available to an enemy alien. They are also not available to persons detained under the ''Preventive Detention Act''. Under [[preventive detention]], the government can imprison a person for a maximum of three months. It means that if the government feels that a person being at liberty can be a threat to the law and order or to the unity and integrity of the nation, it can detain or arrest that person to prevent him from doing this possible harm. After three months such a case is brought before an advisory board for review.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 22 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> 

The constitution also imposes restrictions on these rights. The government restricts these freedoms in the interest of the independence, sovereignty and integrity of India. In the interest of morality and public order, the government can also impose restrictions. However, the right to life and personal liberty cannot be suspended.  The six freedoms are also automatically suspended or have restrictions imposed on them during a state of emergency.

== Right against exploitation ==
[[Image:ChildLabor1910.png|thumb|180px|right|'''[[Child labour]]''' and [[Unfree labour|Begar]] is prohibited under Right against exploitation.]]
The right against exploitation, given in Articles 23 and 24, provides for two provisions, namely the abolition of trafficking in human beings and [[Unfree labor|''Begar'']] (forced labor),<ref name="art23">[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 23 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> and abolition of employment of children below the age of 14 years in dangerous jobs like factories and mines. [[Child labour]] is considered a gross violation of the spirit and provisions of the constitution.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 24 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> ''[[Unfree labour|Begar]]'', practised in the past by landlords, has been declared a crime and is punishable by law. Trafficking in humans for the purpose of [[slave trade]] or [[prostitution]] is also prohibited by law. An exception is made in employment without payment for compulsory services for public purposes. Compulsory military [[conscription]] is covered by this provision.<ref name="art23"/>

== Right to freedom of religion ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Religion in India]] -->
Right to freedom of [[religion]], covered in Articles 25, 26, 27 and 28, provides [[religious freedom]] to all citizens of India. The objective of this right is to sustain the principle of [[secularism]] in India. According to the Constitution, all religions are equal before the State and no religion shall be given preference over the other. Citizens are free to preach, practice and propagate any religion of their choice.  However, certain practices like wearing and carrying of ''[[Kirpan]]s'' in the profession of the [[Sikhism|Sikh religion]], can be restricted in the interest of public order, morality and health.<ref name="art25">[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 25 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> 

Religious communities can set up charitable institutions of their own. However, activities in such institutions which are not religious are performed according to the laws laid down by the government. Establishing a charitable institution can also be restricted in the interest of public order, morality and health.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 26 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> No person shall be compelled to pay taxes for the promotion of a particular religion.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 27 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> A State run institution cannot impart education that is pro-religion.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 28 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> Also, nothing in this article shall affect the operation of any existing law or prevent the State from making any further law regulating or restricting any economic, financial, political or other secular activity which may be associated with religious practice, or providing for social welfare and reform.<ref name="art25"/>

The right to feedom of religion gives the following freedoms:
1.to practise any religon,
2.to follow it according to their specific ways and
3.to preach it.

The only limitation imposed on this fundamental right is that nothing should be done to malign or incite voilence among the followers of other religion.

== Cultural and educational rights ==
[[Image:Flag of India.svg|200px|thumb|right|The Flag of India]]  

As India is a country of many [[languages of India|languages]], [[religion in India|religions]], and [[culture of India|cultures]], the Constitution provides special measures, in Articles 29 and 30, to protect the rights of the minorities. Any community which has a language and a script of its own has the right to conserve and develop them. No citizen can be discriminated against for admission in State or State aided institutions.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 29 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> 

All minorities, religious or linguistic, can set up their own educational institutions in order to preserve and develop their own culture. In granting aid to institutions, the State cannot discriminate against any institution on the basis of the fact that it is administered by a minority institution.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article  30 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> But the right to administer does not mean that the State can not interfere in case of maladministration. In a precedent-setting judgment in 1980, the Supreme Court held that "the State can certainly take regulatory measures to promote the efficiency and excellence of educational standards. It can also issue guidelines for ensuring the security of the services of the teachers or other employees of the institution. In another landmark judgement delivered on 31 October 2002, the Supreme Court ruled that in case of aided minority institutions offering professional courses, admission could only be through a common entrance test conducted by State or a university. Even an unaided minority institution ought not to ignore the merit of the students for admission.

== Right to constitutional remedies ==
Right to constitutional remedies empowers the citizens to move a [[court]] of law in case of any denial of the fundamental rights. For instance, in case of imprisonment, the citizen can ask the court to see if it is according to the provisions of the law of the country. If the court finds that it is not, the person will have to be freed. This procedure of asking the courts to preserve or safeguard the citizens' fundamental rights can be done in various ways. The courts can issue various kinds of ''[[Writs#Indian law|writs]]''. These writs are ''[[habeas corpus]]'', ''[[mandamus]]'', ''[[prohibition]]'', ''[[quo warranto]]'' and ''[[certiorari]]''. When a national or state emergency is declared, this right is suspended by the central government.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 32 Fundamental Rights]].</ref>

== Right to property &mdash; a former fundamental right ==
The Constitution originally provided for the [[right to property]] under Articles 19 and 31. Article 19 guaranteed to all citizens the right to acquire, hold and dispose off property. Article 31 provided that "no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law." It also provided that compensation would be paid to a person whose property has been taken for public purposes. 

The provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times. The 44th [[Constitution of India#Amendments|amendment]] act of 1978 deleted the right to property from the list of Fundamental Rights.<ref name="44amact">[http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend44.htm 44th Amendment Act, 1978].</ref> A new article, Article 300-A, was added to the constitution which provided that "no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law". Thus if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property, there would be no obligation on the part of the State to pay anything as compensation. The aggrieved person shall have no right to move the court under Article 32. Thus, the right to property is no longer a fundamental right, though it is still a constitutional right. If the government appears to have acted unfairly, the action can be challenged in a court of law by citizens.<ref name="pgA33">Tayal, B.B. & Jacob, A.

*Revival
With the Liberalization of the economy and govt's initiative to setup special economic zones has led to many protest by farmers and have thrown the fundamental right to private property reinstatement<ref>http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Should-right-to-property-return/articleshow/4202212.cms</ref>.The supreme Court has sent a notice to the govt questioning why the right shouldn't be brought back as in 2007 The supreme court unanimously said that the fundamental rights are a basic structure of the constitution and cannot be removed or diluted.

== Critical analysis ==
The Fundamental Rights have been criticised for many reasons. Political groups have demanded that the [[right to work]], the right to economic assistance in case of [[unemployment]], old age, and similar rights be enshrined as constitutional guarantees to address issues of poverty and economic insecurity,<ref name="pgA33"/> though these provisions have been enshrined in the [[Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India#Directive Principles of State Policy|Directive Principles of state policy]].<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part IV|Constitution of India-Part IV Article 41 Directive Principles of State Policy]].</ref> The right to freedom and personal liberty has a number of limiting clauses, and thus have been criticized for failing to check the sanctioning of powers often deemed "excessive".<ref name="pgA33"/> There is also the provision of preventive detention and suspension of Fundamental Rights in times of [[State of Emergency in India|Emergency]]. The provisions of acts like the [[Maintenance of Internal Security Act]] (MISA) and the [[National Security Act, 1980|National Security Act]] (NSA) are a means of countering the fundamental rights, because they sanction excessive powers with the aim of fighting internal and cross-border [[terrorism]] and political violence, without safeguards for [[civil rights]].<ref name="pgA33"/> The phrases "security of State", "public order" and "morality" are of wide implication. People of alternate sexuality is criminalized in India with prison term up to 10 years. The meaning of phrases like "reasonable restrictions" and "the interest of public order"  have not been explicitly stated in the [[Constitution of India|constitution]], and this ambiguity leads to unnecessary litigation.<ref name="pgA33"/> The freedom to assemble peacably and without arms is exercised, but in some cases, these meetings are broken up by the police through the use of non-fatal methods.<ref>[http://web.mid-day.com/news/city/2006/may/137263.htm Senior Inspector justifies lathi-charge] during the [[2006 Indian anti-reservation protests]]</ref><ref>[http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1029206&CatID=1 Lathi Charge in Mumbai] during the [[2006 Indian anti-reservation protests]]</ref>

"[[Freedom of press]]" has not been included in the right to freedom, which is necessary for formulating [[public opinion]] and to make [[freedom of expression]] more legitimate.<ref name="pgA33"/> Employment of child labour in hazardous job environments has been reduced, but their employment even in non-hazardous jobs, including their prevalent employment as domestic help violates the spirit and ideals of the [[Constitution of India|constitution]]. More than 16.5 million children are employed and working in India.<ref>{{cite web

== Amendments ==
Changes in Fundamental Rights require a [[Constitution of India#Amendments|Constitutional amendment]] which has to be passed by a special majority of both houses of the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]]. This means that an amendment requires the approval of two-thirds of the members present and voting. However, the number of members voting should not be less than the [[simple majority]] of the house &mdash; whether the [[Lok Sabha]] or [[Rajya Sabha]].
*The [[right to property]] was originally included as a fundamental right. However, the 44th Amendment passed in 1978, revised the status of property rights by stating that "No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law" to further the goals of socialism.<ref name="44amact"/>
*The right to education at elementary level has been made one of the Fundamental Rights under [[#Right to Life and Personal Liberty|right to life and personal liberty]] by the 86th constitutional amendment of 2002.<ref name="86amact"/>
