'''Melbourne Castle''' was a [[medieval architecture|medieval]] castle in [[Melbourne, Derbyshire|Melbourne]], [[Derbyshire]]. It was built on the site of an earlier royal [[manor house]] that had provided accommodation for noblemen hunting in a nearby royal park in the reign of [[John, King of England|King John]]. Construction of the castle was started in 1311 by [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster]], and continued until 1322, shortly before his execution, but the work was never fully completed.

From the early fourteenth century, Melbourne Castle was mainly in the possession of the [[Earl of Lancaster|Earls]] and [[Duke of Lancaster|Dukes of Lancaster]] or the [[The Crown|crown]]. Improvements and repairs were made, notably by [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]], and the building was in generally good condition throughout the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. [[John I, Duke of Bourbon]], was kept at Melbourne for 19 years after his capture at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] in 1415, and the castle was considered as a possible prison for [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Queen of Scots]], although events led to her incarceration elsewhere.

The castle was in decline by the end of the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Although the stonework was sound, minimal maintenance had led to significant deterioration of other parts of the structure. The manor was purchased in 1604 by [[Henry Hastings, 5th Earl of Huntingdon]], who had his own castle in nearby [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]]. The Melbourne property was then demolished and used as a source for building materials. All that remains of Melbourne Castle today is a section of wall about 15&nbsp;m (50&nbsp;ft) long and 4&nbsp;m (13&nbsp;ft) high and some foundations; nothing is known of the internal layout of the former building. The ruins are [[Listed building#England and Wales|grade II listed]] and designated as an [[ancient monument]]. There is no public access to the site.

== Background ==
[[Melbourne, Derbyshire|Melbourne]] is a town in [[South Derbyshire]] close to the [[River Trent]], which  may have originated as buildings associated with the royal manor to the south of the nearby settlement at [[Kings Newton]].<ref name= heath/> Melbourne Castle was constructed on the site of an earlier manor house of unknown date; there is an old tradition that the manor was originally established in about the year 900, during the reign of [[Alfred the Great]], but there is no evidence for this.<ref name= briggs>Briggs (1852) pp. 43<U+2013>49.</ref> As recorded in the [[Domesday Book]], the manor of Melbourne and its lands were the property of King [[Edward the Confessor]] prior to the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]].

A [[medieval deer park|royal hunting park]] close to Melbourne was probably created by [[John, King of England|King John]] around 1200,<ref name=heath>Heath (2005) pp. 1<U+2013>2.</ref> and the King is known to have stayed at the [[manor house]] on at least five occasions.<ref name=DAS/> John gave the manor and its lands to Hugh Beauchamp, although they appear to have soon reverted to the crown,<ref name= magna>Lysons (1817) pp. 209<U+2013>210.</ref> being gifted by [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] to Bishop [[Walter Mauclerk]] of Carlisle in about 1230. The estate returned to the crown on the bishop's death in 1248, and Henry granted the land to his son, [[Edmund Crouchback]], [[Earl of Lancaster|1st Earl of Lancaster]] in 1265.<ref name= Stroud1/> At some later date, the manor appears to have been granted to a Philip Marc,<ref name= magna/> before passing to [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster]], the King's son. This was in 1298 when he came of age, his father having died two years earlier. Early references to the house itself are rare, but there are records of repairs to the gutters in 1246 and to the roof of the King's Chamber in 1248.<ref name= usher>Usher (1991) pp. 126<U+2013>133.</ref>

== Description ==
[[File:Melbourne Castle.jpg|thumb|1733 print of a drawing from around 1580|alt=drawing of a castle]]

The castle was built to the east of the fourteenth-century town on a slightly raised location. The area enclosed within the castle's outer walls was about 2.8&nbsp;ha (7&nbsp;acres), but with outbuildings, other ancillary constructions and orchards, the total area has been estimated to be at least 8&nbsp;ha (20&nbsp;acres). The walls were constructed with rubble faced with ashlar, and even without their former polished facings the walls are about 3&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft) thick.<ref name= briggs/>

All that is known of the appearance of the castle is from contemporary drawings. Although these may seem fanciful to modern eyes, there are better preserved sites which share some features. Tutbury and [[Pontefract Castle|Pontefract castles]] both have similar [[gatehouse]]s and [[chapel]]s, and Tutbury's [[motte-and-bailey castle|motte]] and Pontefract's [[curtain wall]] are also close in style to those in the illustrations. [[Sandal Castle]] has a multi-angular tower like those depicted, and this feature is confirmed at Melbourne by foundations which still remain.<ref name= usher/>

A bakehouse, kitchen and chapel are recorded, as well as the hall, great chamber, and drawbridge, but the details of the internal layout for the castle are unknown.<ref name= Stroud25>Stroud (2002) pp. 25, 28.</ref>

== History ==
=== Early years ===

[[File:Melbourne castle wall.jpg|thumb|End view of the surviving wall section|alt=end view of a wide stone wall]]

Earl Thomas granted the manor to his steward, Robert de Holland, in February 1308.<ref name= usher/> In 1311, Robert obtained a [[licence to crenellate]] from [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] in order to fortify the manor house,<ref name=DAS/> and the more modest earlier building was converted into a castle between 1311 and 1322. Local tradition says that the stone was obtained from a quarry on the site of what is now Melbourne Pool.<ref name = heath/> The records show <U+00A3>1,313 was spent on the project in the year 1313<U+2013>14,<ref name=Emery>Emery (1996) p. 422.</ref>{{efn|For comparison, the average annual baronial income for the top 27 barons in that period was <U+00A3>668.<ref name= pounds> Pounds (1993) p. 147.</ref>}} of which <U+00A3>548 was paid to masons for dressing stone. Several masons working on the project were involved in an affray at [[Ravenstone, Leicestershire|Ravenstone]] in 1315.<ref name= usher/> The important medieval buildings in Melbourne were constructed from the local [[bedrock]], [[Millstone Grit]]. This is a coarsely grained [[sandstone]] which can be worked to produce good-quality [[ashlar]].<ref name= Morris2>Morris (2011) pp. 6, 17.</ref> The village was centred around the church, castle and High Street until the late eighteenth century.<ref name= Morris>Morris (2011) p. 4.</ref>

Earl Thomas, with other barons, captured King Edward's favourite, [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Piers Gaveston]], and killed him in 1312. Nevertheless, the King stayed at Melbourne in 1314. For a time, after Edward's defeat at [[Bannockburn]], the earl, a friend of the Scots, controlled most of England, but by 1321, Edward had raised an army and driven Thomas from the Midlands. The Lancastrian castles at Melbourne and [[Tutbury Castle|Tutbury]] were left deserted and looted by the local populace. Earl Thomas was finally defeated at the [[Battle of Boroughbridge]] in 1322.<ref name= usher/> He was swiftly executed, and Robert de Holland was beheaded in [[Dover]] some years later.<ref name= briggs/> The King sent a garrison to Melbourne and appointed a steward, Ralph Basset, to replace the incumbent, John de Hardedeshull.<ref name= usher/><ref name= Rickard>Rickard (2002) p. 168.</ref> In March, those who had stolen from the castle were arrested, and by April Edward had withdrawn his troops.<ref name= usher/> He appointed Robert Tocher and Roger Bellers in 1323 to help administer his possessions in Melbourne using money obtained from confiscations of rebel property in Staffordshire. Edward stayed at Melbourne again in 1325, and while there he issued a right to collect tolls to the men of nearby [[Swarkestone]] to repair the [[Swarkestone Bridge|bridge]] over the Trent.<ref name= usher/>

=== Lancastrian improvements ===

[[File:Johnofgaunt.jpg|[[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]] made significant improvements to the castle in the late fourteenth century.|alt=Painting of a nobleman|thumb]]

The castle, still unfinished at the time of Thomas' execution, and its lands, remained as crown property until it was bestowed on [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster]], Earl Thomas' brother, in 1327.<ref name = heath/><ref name=Emery/> In turn, it passed to Henry's son, the fourth earl, who became the [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster|first Duke of Lancaster]]. At the time of the duke's death in 1361, his [[Constable#United Kingdom|constable]] was Ingram Fauconer, who received an annual life stipend of <U+00A3>10, a further <U+00A3>5 going to his wife. Henry's heiress was [[Blanche of Lancaster|Blanche]], wife of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]].<ref name= usher/>{{efn|Henry had no male heir, so his title, [[Duke of Lancaster]], died with him. It was recreated for John of Gaunt, who is also the first duke, but of the ''second'' creation. The [[Duchy of Lancaster]] has been a royal privilege since 1413.<ref name="privy">{{cite web| title=Privy Purse and Duchy of Lancaster| url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalHousehold/Royalfinances/Sourcesoffunding/PrivyPurseandDuchyofLancaster.aspx| publisher=Royal Household| accessdate=17 October 2013}}</ref>}} Duke John confirmed Fauconer's pension when he came into possession of the Lancastrian lands.<ref name= usher/>

Peter Melbourne was made keeper of the Melbourne estate in 1377 with an annual income of <U+00A3>10. He was granted another 66[[shilling|s]]&nbsp;8[[penny|d]] in 1386, and 10&nbsp;[[Mark (money)#England and Scotland|marks]] (<U+00A3>6&nbsp;13s&nbsp;4d) in 1395. The last award was conditional on his not meddling with the offices of constable and keeper of the parks, which had passed on to his son, also called Peter.<ref name= usher/> The younger Peter Melbourne was involved in the upbringing of the future [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] during the reign of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]. He was again appointed constable and steward of the Derbyshire manor in March 1399, although he gave up his office in April in return for an annuity from King Richard, who had confiscated the Lancastrian estates when John of Gaunt died earlier that year. Upon Henry's seizure of the throne, Peter was confirmed as constable and in October 1399, his annuity was increased from <U+00A3>10 to 100&nbsp;marks (<U+00A3>66&nbsp;8s); in the following year he was awarded land in Derbyshire confiscated from [[Thomas Merke]], Bishop of Carlisle, co-leader of plot against the King.<ref name= curry>Curry (2013) pp. 18<U+2013>20.</ref>{{efn| A statue of a knight in Melbourne church has the de Melbourne arms of a [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] and three [[scallop]]s.<ref name= usher/>}}

The [[Duchy of Lancaster]] continued to improve and expand the property through the 14th and 15th centuries.<ref name=Emery/> John of Gaunt had windows glazed in the Communal Hall and the Great Chamber in 1392/3, along with other works. He repaired a drawbridge in 1393/4 and made plumbing improvements in 1399/1400, using lead acquired as a [[asset forfeiture|forfeit]] two years earlier.<ref name= usher/>

For 19 years, the castle served as a prison for [[John I, Duke of Bourbon]] after he was taken at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] in 1415.<ref name=Firth>Firth (1905) p. 20.</ref>{{efn|Bourbon was granted 20s a day as keep for himself and his retinue, and 33s&nbsp;4d when travelling. He was allowed to visit the [[Charles, Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans|Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans]], who was held in Pontefract castle, and to go to London.<ref name= usher/>}} His custodian was a Nicholas Montgomery the Younger.<ref name= briggs/> Nineteenth-century local historian John Joseph Briggs claimed that during the [[Wars of the Roses]], the castle was partially dismantled by the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] forces of [[Margaret of Anjou]],<ref name=Firth/> but since her campaign was along the line of the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]], it was [[Melbourne]], [[Cambridgeshire]] she sacked, not its Derbyshire namesake.<ref name= usher/>{{efn|The original source, Stowe's ''Annals of England'', listed the towns as [[Grantham]], [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]], Peterborrow ([[Peterborough]]), [[Huntingdon]], [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]], Meleborne and "all the townes by the way into [[St Albans]]". The Melbourne concerned is 3.2&nbsp;km (2&nbsp;mi) from Royston.<ref name= usher/>}}

In 1545, [[antiquarian]] [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] reported to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] the property was in good enough shape that it was described as "praty and yn meately good reparation"<ref name=usher/>{{efn|"pretty and in appropriately good repair." Of 258 castles surveyed by Leland, only 91 were described as in good condition.<ref name= Thompson> Thompson (2008) p. 104.</ref>}} perhaps following repairs in the reign of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]],<ref name= magna/> when Sir Ralph Shirley, a commander at Agincourt, was governor of the castle.<ref name= briggs/>

When [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] became queen, she ordered a survey of her castles. A 1562 report told her that only ten castles in the north of her realm were worth keeping; Melbourne was not one of these. A further survey in 1576 reported that, although the stonework was in good condition apart from one chimney and window, the timbers were perished, the lead roof was full of holes, one kitchen was on the verge of collapse, and another needed its floor replacing. In the same year, [[George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury]] wrote to the queen to assure her that the castle was in good condition, worth <U+00A3>1,000, and could be repaired for <U+00A3>100. Since he was responsible for keeping the imprisoned [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] and her 140 retainers, he hoped to get her moved to Melbourne.<ref name= usher/> In 1583, the castle was inspected again to see if it was suitable to house the captive queen. Although the rooms were sufficient in number and quality, the unfinished building was deemed "imperfect at every corner".<ref name = heath/> The large rooms would need subdividing, the floors were earth and plaster, and there was no paved courtyard "so as being out of dors you are in the myre, for it is verie foule and unpleasaunt to walk round about the said house".<ref name= Stroud14>Stroud (2002) pp. 14<U+2013>17.</ref> In 1584, Queen Elizabeth finally decided to move Mary to Melbourne, only for the plan to be abandoned following the [[Babington Plot]] to assassinate the English queen and place her Scottish cousin on the throne.<ref name= usher/>

In 1597, the castle was being used as a cattle pound,<ref name= Black>Black (2006) p. 18.</ref> although a survey in 1602 assured Elizabeth that it was a "faire and anciente castle", in the charge of Gilbert, Earl of Shaftsbury.<ref name= briggs/> The constable's annual fee of <U+00A3>10 was the same as that paid to Ingram Fauconer 140 years earlier.<ref name= briggs/>

The castle and lands were bought for <U+00A3>4,700 in 1604, by [[Henry Hastings, 5th Earl of Huntingdon]],<ref name= usher/> whose family seat at [[Ashby de la Zouch Castle]] was just 11&nbsp;km (7&nbsp;mi) away.<ref name = ashby>{{cite web| author = Goodall, John | title= Ashby de la Zouch Castle | work= History and Research | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/ashby-de-la-zouch-castle/history-and-research/ | publisher= English Heritage | accessdate = 21 October 2013| archiveurl= | archivedate= | deadurl = no }}</ref> Melbourne Castle was destroyed between 1610 and 1637 so that its materials could be used in other construction.<ref name=Emery/><ref name= Black/> By 1629, it is likely that all the worked stone above ground level had been removed; Sir [[John Coke]] of Melbourne Hall obtained permission from the Bishop of Carlisle in that year to quarry stone from the castle foundations.<ref name= Stroud14/> Some of the facing stones were used to repair the [[weir]] at [[King's Mill, Castle Donington|King's Mill]], seen by some at the time to fulfil the words of a local prophet that "the waters of the Trent should overflow the towers of Melbourne castle".<ref name= briggs/> The Hastings estate was gradually sold off,<ref name= Stroud10>Stroud (2002) p. 10.</ref> and the castle site was sold by [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Earl Moira]] in 1811.<ref name=heath4>Heath (2005) p. 4.</ref>

== Ruins and archaeology ==

[[File:43and45 Castle Road Melbourne.jpg|thumb|upright|43 and 45 Castle Street are faced with stone taken from the castle.|alt=Stone-clad terraced houses]]

A section of rubble wall about 15&nbsp;m (50&nbsp;ft) long and 4&nbsp;m (13&nbsp;ft) high remains,<ref name=usher/> incorporated into outbuilding of the adjacent farm on its north side. The ruins and the later farmhouse are jointly [[Listed building#England and Wales|grade II listed]] and the castle remains are designated as an [[ancient monument]]. The area to the south of the wall has been excavated to reveal the ashlar bases of two polygonal towers. The site is on the east side of Castle Street in a private garden to which there is no public access.<ref name=listing>{{cite web |title=Castle Farmhouse and Ruins of Melbourne Castle and Outbuildings, Melbourne|work =British Listed Buildings|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-83039-castle-farmhouse-and-ruins-of-melbourne-c |publisher=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk |accessdate=30 May 2011}}</ref><ref name = monument>{{cite web| author = | title= Melbourne Castle Fortified Manor and Earlier Medieval Manorial Remains | work= Ancient Monuments | url= http://www.ancientmonuments.info/en23336-melbourne-castle-fortified-manor-and-earli| publisher= ancientmonuments.co.uk| accessdate =16 October 2013 | archiveurl= | archivedate= | deadurl = no }}</ref>

Some of the stone taken from the castle was used to construct the mid-eighteenth-century grade II-listed buildings at 43 and 45 Castle Street,<ref name=usher/><ref name=listing4345>{{cite web |title=43 and 45, Castle Street, Melbourne |work =British Listed Buildings | url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-83036-43-and-45-castle-street-melbourne-derbysh |publisher=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk |accessdate=16 October 2013}}</ref> and other buildings known to have used the stone, but no longer extant, include old houses demolished to build the Castle Mill textile factory. The mill, now demolished, was said to have been built on castle foundations up to 4&nbsp;m (12&nbsp;ft) thick; 15 Castle Street also rests on the old foundation wall. It is likely that the former Melbourne Furnace and the Furnace Farm barn also used recycled castle material.<ref name=usher/>

An early nineteenth-century excavation found underground apartments "of considerable extent and superior workmanship", and excavations in the latter part of the same century found considerable foundations in the gardens of Castle Farm. Castle Mills housing estate contains a now-covered well 2&nbsp;m (6&nbsp;ft) in width and 15&nbsp;m (50&nbsp;ft) deep, and work in 1961 uncovered massive 5&nbsp;m (16&nbsp;ft) foundations east of the old mill and on the same alignment as the existing wall. Excavations in 1969<U+2013>1971 found an extensive network of walls faced with ashlar, a door post, the base of a spiral staircase and evidence of an outer courtyard. Many stones had [[mason's mark]]s.<ref name=usher/> During construction works in 1988, masonry including the rubble centres of two large east<U+2013>west walls was found in test trenches.<ref name= Stroud14/> Apart from the area of the turret bases next to the standing wall, none of the [[archaeology]] is now visible.<ref name=usher/>
