'''Dyango''', born '''Jos<U+00E9> G<U+00F3>mez Romero''' on March 5, 1940 in [[Barcelona]], is a [[Spain|Spanish]] musician.  While he was born in Barcelona, capital of La Catalu<U+00F1>a, he is not a Catal<U+00E1>n, but rather, of Castilian or "Castellano" ancestry.

He was born on March 5, but his father filed the birth on May 8, the date that appears on his official records.

He named himself after the [[Romani people|Romani]] (Gypsy) guitarist [[Django Reinhardt]]. Two of his sons, [[Marcos Llunas]] and Jordi, are also singers, though the first one is currently retired.

Jos<U+00E9> G<U+00F3>mez Romero, Dyango, was formed musically at the Conservatorio de M<U+00FA>sica de Barcelona and toured Europe for two years performing different types of music. He decided to expand his voice as a solo artist and debuted at El Festival de la Canci<U+00F3>n del Duero (1965).

After a brief stint with Zafiro, in 1974, Dyango signed a music contract with EMI. His first album was recorded in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p29096|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Dyango|last=Henderson|first=Alex|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref>

Since then, his repertoire has included "boleros" (romantic Spanish music), "tangos" (Argentinian music) and "rancheras" (Mexican music), remakes of songs from the 60's, dozens of his own songs, even lyrical pieces. In his career, he has recorded duets with the following artists: [[Celia Cruz]], [[Oscar D'Le<U+00F3>n]], [[Sheena Easton]], [[Roberto Goyeneche]], [[Pimpinela]] and the [[tenor]] [[Jaume Aragall]].

Dyango has obtained in his career 55 gold records and 40 platinum, which have been awarded in Spain as well as other Latin American countries, as well as the USA. Amongst them 'A coraz<U+00F3>n Abierto' has received double platinum status.

Currently, Dyango is immersed with taking on new forms of expressions of his career, like painting.

Dyango suffered a heart attack and has been admitted in a Barcelona hospital until March 5, 2009.
