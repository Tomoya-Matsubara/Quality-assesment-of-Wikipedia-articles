It was centered in [[Ghazni|Ghazna]], and ruled much of [[Persia]], [[Transoxania]], and the northern parts of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. 

The dynasty was founded by [[Seb<U+00FC>k Tigin|Sebuktigin]] upon his succession to rule of territories centered aound the city of [[Ghazni|Ghazna]] from his father-in-law [[Alp Tigin]]; a break-away ex-general of the <U+1E62><U+0101>m<U+0101>n<U+012B> sultans.<ref name="EB">Encyclopedia Britannica, ''Ghaznavid Dynasty'', Online Edition 2007 ([http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9036676/Ghaznavid-Dynasty LINK])</ref> Due to the political and cultural influence of their predecessors - that of the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Samanids|<U+1E62><U+0101>m<U+0101>n<U+012B> dynasty]] - the originally Turkic Ghaznavids had become thoroughly [[Persianization|Persianized]].<ref name="Shahrbanu">M.A. Amir-Moezzi, ''"Shahrbanu"'', [[Encyclopaedia Iranica]], Online Edition, ([http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp7/ot_shahrbanu_20050131.html LINK]): ''"... here one might bear in mind that non-Persian dynasties such as the Ghaznavids, Saljuqs and Ilkhanids were rapidly to adopt the Persian language and have their origins traced back to the ancient kings of Persia rather than to Turkish heroes or Muslim saints ..."''</ref><ref name="EI">[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C.E.

Yarshater]</ref> Sebuktigin's son, [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Shah Mahmoud]], expanded the empire in the region that stretched from the [[Oxus river]] to the [[Indus Valley]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]; and in the west it reached [[Rayy]] and [[Hamadan]]. Under the reign of [[Mas'ud I of Ghazni|Mas'ud I]] it experienced major territorial losses. It lost its western territories to the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuqs]] in the [[Battle of Dandanaqan]] resulting in a restriction of its holdings to [[Afghanistan]], [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]] and the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. In [[1151]], Sultan Bahram Shah lost Ghazni to Ala'uddin Hussain of [[Ghurids|Ghor]] and the capital was moved to [[Lahore]] until its subsequent capture by the [[Ghurids]] in 1186. 

==Rise to power==

Two military families arose from the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] Slave-Guards of the [[Samanids]] <U+2014> the Simjurids and Ghaznavids <U+2014> who ultimately proved disastrous to the Samanids. The [[Simjurids]] received an appanage in the [[Kohistan District, Afghanistan|Khohistan]] region of eastern [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. [[Alptigin|Alp Tigin]] founded the Ghaznavid fortunes when he established himself at Ghazna (modern [[Ghazni]], [[Afghanistan]]) in 962. He and [[Abu al-Hasan Simjuri]], as [[Samanid]] generals, competed with each other for the governorship of [[Khorasan]] and control of the Samanid empire by placing on the throne [[emir]]s they could dominate when [[Abdul Malik I of Samanid]] died in 961. But when the [[Samanid]] Emir [[Abdul Malik I of Samanid|Abdul Malik I]] died in 961 CE it created a succession crisis between Abdul Malik's  brothers. A court party instigated by men of the scribal class<U+2014>civilian ministers as contrasted with Turkic generals<U+2014>rejected Alp Tigin's candidate for the Samanid throne. [[Mansur I of Samanid|Mansur I]] was installed, and Alp Tigin prudently retired to his fief of Ghazna. The Simjurids enjoyed control of Khorasan south of the [[Oxus]] but were hard-pressed by a third great Iranian dynasty, the [[Buwayhid]]s, and were unable to survive the collapse of the Samanids and the rise of the Ghaznavids.

The struggles of the Turkic slave generals for mastery of the throne with the help of shifting allegiance from the court's ministerial leaders both demonstrated and accelerated the Samanid decline. Samanid weakness attracted into [[Transoxania]] the [[Qarluq]] [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], who had recently converted to Islam. They occupied Bukhara in 992 to establish in Transoxania the [[Qarakhanid]], or Ilek Khanid, dynasty. Alp Tigin had been succeeded at Ghazna by Seb<U+00FC>ktigin (died 997). [[Sabuktigin|Seb<U+00FC>ktigin]]'s son [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Mahmud]] made an agreement with the Qarakhanids whereby the Oxus was recognized as their mutual boundary. 

==Domination==
{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}}
[[Seb<U+00FC>k Tigin|Saboktekin]] made himself lord of nearly all the present territory of [[Afghanistan]] and of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] by conquest of [[Samanid]] and [[Shahi]] lands. In [[997]], [[Mahmud of Ghaznavid|Mahmud]], the son of Seb<U+00FC>k Tigin, succeeded his father upon his death, and with him Ghazni and the Ghaznavid dynasty have become perpetually associated. He completed the conquest of [[Samanid]], [[Shahi]] lands, the [[Ismaili]] Kingdom of [[Multan]], [[Sindh]] as well as some Buwayhid territory. Under him all accounts was the golden age and the height of the Ghaznevid Empire. Mahmud carried out seventeen expeditions through northern [[India]] establishing his control and setting up tributary states. His raids also resulted in the looting of a great deal of plunder. From the borders of [[Kurdistan]] to [[Samarkand]], from the [[Caspian Sea]] to the [[Yamuna]], he established his authority.

The wealth brought back from the Indian expeditions to Ghazni was enormous, and contemporary historians (e.g. [[Abolfazl Beyhaghi]], [[Ferdowsi]]) give glowing descriptions of the magnificence of the capital, as well as of the conquerors munificent support of literature. Mahmud died in ([[1030]]).  Even though there was some revival of importance under Ibrahim (1059-1099), the empire never reached anything like the same splendor and power. It was soon overshadowed by the [[Seljuqs]] of [[Iran]].

==Decline==
Mahmud's son [[Mas'ud I of Ghazni|Mas'ud]] was unable to preserve the empire and following a disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Dandanaqan]] in ([[1040]]) lost all the Ghaznavid lands in [[Iran]] and [[Central Asia]] to the Seljuks and plunged the realm into a "Time of troubles".<ref name="EB"/><ref name="Iranica">Encyclopedia Iranica, ''Ghaznavids'', Edmund Bosworth, Online Edition 2007, ([http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v10f6/v10f608.html LINK])</ref> Mas'ud's son Ibrahim who re-established a truncated empire on a firmer basis by arriving at an peace agreement with the Seljuks and a restoration of cultural and political linkages.<ref name="Iranica"/> Under Ibrahim and his successors saw a period of sustained tranquility for the empire. Shorn of it's western land it was increasingly sustained by riches accrued from raids across Northern India where it faced stiff resistance from [[Rajput]] rulers such as the [[Paramara]] of [[Malwa]] and the [[Gahadvala]] of [[Kannauj]].<ref name="Iranica"/> Signs of weakness in the state became apparent when Masud III died in [[1115]] with internal strife between his sons ending with the ascension of Sultan Bahram Shah as a Seljuk Vassal.<ref name="Iranica"/> Sultan Bahram Shah, was the last Ghaznavid King ruling [[Ghazni|Ghazna]], the first and main Ghaznavid capital. Ala'uddin Hussain, a [[Ghorid]] King, conquered the city of Ghazni in 1151, for the revenge of his brother's death. He razed all the city, and burned it for 7 days, after which he got famous as ''"Jah<U+0101>nsoz"'' (''World Burner''). Ghazni was restored to the Ghaznavids by the intervention of the Seljuks who came to Behrams aid.<ref name="Iranica"/> Ghaznavid struggles with the Ghurids continued in the subsequent years as they nibbled away at Ghaznavid territory and Ghazni and [[Zabulistan]] was lost a group of [[Oghuz]] Turks before captured by the Gurids.<ref name="Iranica"/> Ghaznavid power in northern [[India]] continued until the conquest of [[Lahore]] from Khusrau Malik in 1186.<ref name="Iranica"/>

==Legacy==
The Ghaznevid Empire was the first significant Islamic empire in Central Asia{{Fact|date=August 2007}} and marked a break of political control from the [[Abassids]] and [[Baghdad]]. The Ghaznavid empire grew to cover much of present-day [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], and northwest [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], and the Ghaznavids are generally credited with launching Islam into [[Hindu]]-dominated India. In addition to the wealth accumulated through raiding Indian cities, and exacting tribute from Indian [[Raja]]s the Ghaznavids also benefited from their position as an intermediary along the trade routes between [[China]] and the [[Mediterranean]]. They were however unable to hold power for long and by 1040 the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]]s had taken over their [[Persian Empire|Persian]] domains and a century later the [[Ghurids]] took over their remaining sub-continental lands.
