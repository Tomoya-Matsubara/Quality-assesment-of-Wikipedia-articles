'''Saint Everilda (Everildis, Everild, Averil) of Everingham''' was a [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] [[saint]] of the 7th century who founded a convent at [[Everingham]], in the [[England|English]] county of the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]].

There are two churches dedicated to St Everilda - [[Nether Poppleton]] and [[Everingham]]

She was converted to [[Christianity]] by Saint [[Birinus]], along with King [[Cynegils of Wessex]], in 635. Her legend states that she was of the [[Wessex]] [[nobility]].  She fled from home to become a [[nun]], and was joined by Saints Bega and [[Wuldreda]].  [[Saint Wilfrid of York]] made them all nuns at a place called the Bishop's Farm, later known as Everildisham.  This place has been identified with present-day Everingham.  She gathered a large community of some nine hundred and eighty women.

==Veneration==
Her name appears in the ''[[Martyrology of Usuard]]'' as well as in the church calendars of [[York]] and [[Northumbria]].

Her [[feast day]] is [[9 July]].
