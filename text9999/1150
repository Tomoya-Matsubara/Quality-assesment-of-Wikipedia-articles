'''Alice in Chains''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]<!-- See <ref name="Genre"> --> band formed in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington]] in 1987. The band is currently fronted by  [[William DuVall]]. The band has released three studio albums, three EPs, two live albums, four compilations, and two DVDs. They are currently working on the first studio album recorded since the 1995 album ''[[Alice in Chains (album)|Alice in Chains]]''. This will be the first album from the band without former lead singer [[Layne Staley]], who died in 2002.

Alice in Chains was one of the most successful bands from the Seattle [[grunge music]] scene, selling an nearly 11 million albums in the [[United States]] alone according to the RIAA. They have had two number 1 albums (''[[Jar of Flies]]'' and ''Alice in Chains'') on the [[Billboard 200]], eleven top 10 singles on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, and have been nominated for six [[Grammy Award]]s.

==History==
===Early career (1987<U+2013>1990)===

In 1987,<ref name="Stargate">{{cite web |url=http://users.stargate.net/~holliday/AICHIS.HTM. |title=Stargate - Alice in Chains |publisher=Stargate.com |accessdate=2007-11-09}}</ref> [[Layne Staley]] met guitarist and song-writer [[Jerry Cantrell]] at a practice studio named "Music Bank".<ref name="All Music Guide">{{cite web| url=http://music.aol.com/artist/alice-in-chains/biography/1002947 |title=Alice in Chains Biography |publisher=[[AOL]] |author=Erlewine, Thomas and Proto, Greg |accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref> Staley was trying to form a band due to the decline of his then-current band, Sleeze, and asked Cantrell to join him. Cantrell disbanded his band, Diamond Lie, and asked the bassist [[Mike Starr (musician)|Mike Starr]] to join the new band, named Alice N' Chains.<ref name="All Music Guide"/> Cantrell also asked [[Sean Kinney]], a drummer dating Cantrell's sister at the time, to join the band.<ref name="All Music Guide"/><ref name="isound">{{cite web| url=http://www.isound.com/alice_in_chains |title=Alice in Chains - Alternative Rock from Seattle WA |publisher=Isound.com |accessdate=2007-12-08}}</ref> The new group began writing original material and playing clubs in Seattle, eventually changing their name to Alice in Chains. Their name was derived from Staley's former band, Sleeze, stating, "We were dressed in drag and played speed metal, it just seemed to be a suitable name for us".<ref name="AIC ticket site">{{cite web| url=http://www.soldouteventtickets.com/listings/240/240/9437/Concerts/alice-in-chains |title=Alice in Chains Tickets |publisher=Soldouteventtickets.com |accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref>

In 1989 [[Columbia Records]] signed the band. After recording a series of demos in early 1989, the band released their first official recording in [[July 1990]], entitled ''[[We Die Young]]''. The title track had moderate success on metal-oriented radio, preparing the way for the release later that year of the group's first full-length [[studio album]], [[Facelift (album)|Facelift]], which debuted at #42 on the [[Billboard 200]] charts.<ref name="Alice in Chains - Artist chart History">{{cite web| url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&model.vnuArtistId=3943&model.vnuAlbumId=624727 |title=Alice in Chains - Artist chart History |publisher=[[Billboard.com]] |accessdate=2007-11-09}}</ref><ref name="All Music Guide"/> The song "[[Man in the Box]]" had unexpected success as a single, the video for which went into regular rotation on [[MTV]]. ''Facelift'' was certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] by the RIAA, with access sales of 500,000 copies in the United States at the end of the year. The successful debut was supported by a tour opening for [[Van Halen]], [[Poison (band)|Poison]], and [[Iggy Pop]].<ref name="All Music Guide"/>

===Rise to fame (1991<U+2013>1994)===

On [[1992-03-21]] Alice in Chains released their second EP entitled ''[[Sap (EP)|Sap]]''. The EP contained five acoustic songs (one being a [[hidden track]]), in order to  keep the band in the public eye between the albums ''Facelift'' and ''[[Dirt (album)|Dirt]]''.<ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite web| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/aliceinchains/biography |title=Rolling Stone: Alice in Chains Biography |publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in conjunction with Simon & Schuster |work=''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'' |date=[[2001]] |accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref> ''Sap'' featured guest artists such as [[Ann Wilson]] of [[Heart (band)|Heart]], who joined Staley and Cantrell for the choruses of "Brother", "Am I Inside" and "Love Song", as well as [[Mark Arm]] of [[Mudhoney]] and [[Chris Cornell]] of [[Soundgarden]], who appeared on the song "Right Turn" (credited in the liner notes to [[Alice Mudgarden]]). [[Chris Cornell]] also sang some backing vocals on the track "Brother".<ref name="Sap - Metallum">{{cite web| url=http://www.metal-archives.com/release.php?id=4003 |title=Alice in Chains - Sap |publisher=[[Metal Archives]] |accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref> The album has been certified gold by the RIAA.

The band received exposure to pop culture in 1992 when one of their new songs, "[[Would?]]", appeared on the soundtrack for ''[[Singles (1992 film)|Singles]]'', a motion picture by filmmaker [[Cameron Crowe]] based on the lives of Seattle singles.  The band also appeared in the film, performing the songs "Would?" and "It Ain't Like That" during one of the club scenes.<ref name="Internet Movie Database">{{cite web| url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0105415/fullcredits#cast |title=Singles - Full Cast and Crew |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref>

On [[1992-09-29]], Alice in Chains' second full length album ''[[Dirt (album)|Dirt]]'' was released. The album peaked at number 6 on the Billboard charts, and since its release it has been certified 4x [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the RIAA. This is the band's highest selling album and considered by many fans and [[All Music Guide]], their best work.<ref name="All Music Guide"/><ref name="Dirt Review">{{cite web| url=http://cd.ciao.co.uk/Dirt_Alice_In_Chains__Review_5350800 |title=Alice in Chains - Dirt review |publisher=cd.ciao.co.uk |date=[[2003-08-02]] |accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref> ''Dirt'' featured some of the band's highest charting singles, and featured a song titled "Iron Gland" with guest vocalist [[Tom Araya]] of [[Slayer]].<ref name="Billboard singles">{{cite web| url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Singles&model.vnuArtistId=3943&model.vnuAlbumId=454488 |title=Alice in Chains - Artist Chart History - Singles |publisher=[[Billboard.com]] |accessdate=2007-12-06}}</ref> While the band was touring to promote ''Dirt'', Starr left the group due to the band's nonstop schedule, to spend time with his family.<ref name="Answerbag">{{cite web| url=http://clubs.pathfinder.gr/AliceInChains_ |title=Clubs.pathfinder.gr - Alice In Chains |publisher=Clubs.pathfinder.gr |accessdate=2007-12-14}}</ref> Starr was soon replaced by former [[Ozzy Osbourne]] [[bassist]] [[Mike Inez]]. The band met in the studio once again in 1993 to record two new songs, "What the Hell Have I?" and "A Little Bitter", for the soundtrack of the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] film, ''[[Last Action Hero]]''.<ref name="Last Action Hero">{{cite web| url=http://www.amazon.com/Last-Action-Hero-Original-Picture/dp/B00000297D |title=Last Action Hero: Music From The Original Motion Picture |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref> During the summer of 1993, Alice in Chains joined bands such as [[Primus (band)|Primus]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], and [[Babes in Toyland (band)|Babes in Toyland]] for the alternative music festival [[Lollapalooza]].  It would be the last time that Alice in Chains would undertake a major tour.<ref name="History of rock music">{{cite web| url=http://www.history-of-rock-music.com/artist/alice-in-chains.php |title=Alice in Chains - History of Rock Music |publisher=History of Rock Music.com |author=Lee, Orvil |accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref>

On [[1994-01-25]], the band released their second acoustic based EP entitled ''[[Jar of Flies]]''. With a track list of seven songs, ''Jar of Flies'' was firmly in the EP category but debuted at No. 1 on album sales charts, the first EP ever to reach that position.<ref name="Sputnikmusic - JOF">{{cite web| url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=87 |title=Alice in Chains - Jar of Flies |publisher=Sputnikmusic |accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref> The EP was written and recorded in a week.<ref name="AIC BIO">{{cite web| url=http://aic.gsg2007.de/biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=aic.gsg2007.de |accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref> It featured their first and only number one single on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock charts]], entitled "No Excuses". Following its release, Alice in Chains were scheduled to tour during the summer of 1994 with Metallica and opener Suicidal Tendencies but withdrew prior to the start of the tour. [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]] replaced Alice in Chains in some venues, while others were played by [[Candlebox]].<ref name="Rolling Stones on Stayley's death">{{cite web| author=Rothman, Robin |date=[[2002-04-22]] |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/aliceinchains/articles/story/5934348/layne_staley_found_dead |title=Layne Stayley Found Dead |publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]'' |accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref>

===Later years (1995<U+2013>1997)===

The band did not tour for the remainder of their time with Staley, adding fuel to speculation about Staley's addiction to [[heroin]].<ref name="History of rock music"/> Staley performed several shows with [[Mad Season]], a "grunge [[Supergroup (bands)|supergroup]]" side project formed in 1995 with [[Pearl Jam]] guitarist [[Mike McCready]] and [[Screaming Trees]] drummer [[Barrett Martin]]. Mad Season released one studio album entitled, ''[[Above (album)|Above]]'', featuring Staley.<ref name="Sonymusic - Mad season">{{cite web| url=http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/MadSeason/ |title=Mad Season |publisher=Sony Music |accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref>

On [[1995-11-07]], Alice in Chains returned with the release of a self-titled album, ''[[Alice in Chains (album)|Alice in Chains]]''. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and has been certified 2x platinum.<ref name="Alice in Chains - Artist chart History"/> The group again failed to support the album with a tour, due to Stayley's increasing [[heroin]] addiction.<ref name="Staley dead-VH1">{{cite web| author=D'Angelo, Joe |date=[[2002-04-20]] |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1453520/04202002/alice_in_chains.jhtml |title=Layne Staley, Alice In Chains Singer, Dead At 34 |publisher=[[VH1]] |accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref> This would be the last studio album that Alice in Chains would produce.<ref name="MTV reunion article">{{cite web| url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1524813/02232006/alice_in_chains.jhtml |title=Remaining Alice In Chains Members Reuniting For Summer Gigs |publisher=MTV.com |author=Harris, Chris |date=[[2006-02-23]] |accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref>

The band re-surfaced on [[1996-04-10]] to perform their first concert in three years on [[MTV Unplugged]], a program featuring all-acoustic setlists.<ref name="IMDB Unpluuged">{{cite web| url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0276768/ |title=Alice in Chains: MTV Unplugged |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref> At a point in the program Staley sang the incorrect verse to the song "[[Sludge Factory]]", causing the song to break down, and forcing the band to restart it. In fact, the band took six attempts at "[[Sludge Factory]]" before being satisfied with the results.<ref name="Alice In Chains Concert Chronology">{{cite web| url=http://www.bacus.net/alice/aicshows/960410.htm |title=Alice in Chains Concert Chronology: MTV Unplugged Session |publisher=John Bacus |accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref> The set included the popular singles "[[Down in a Hole]]", "[[Heaven Beside You]]", and "[[Would?]]".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1089744/a/Unplugged.htm |title=Unplugged CD - Alice in Chains |publisher=CD Universe |accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref> The band reworked their heavier songs with fresh acoustic arrangements and included a rhythm guitarist, [[Scott Olson]], to fill out the sound.<ref name="IMDB Unpluuged"/> They also introduced a new song, "Killer Is Me". An album and video of the performance were released in July of that year, with the album debuting at number three on the Billboard 200.<ref name="Alice in Chains - Artist chart History"/> Both releases have been certified platinum.

After the Unplugged show, the band opened four shows on the [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] reunion tour filling in for [[Stone Temple Pilots]], who had to pull out because of lead singer [[Scott Weiland]]'s drug problems. The concert held on [[1996-07-03]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]] was the last concert Alice in Chains performed with Staley.<ref name="Casino Ballroom">{{cite web| url=http://www.casinoballroom.com/event-detail.php?event=94 |title=Alice in Chains - Sold Out |publisher=Hamptin Beach Casino Ballroom |accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref>

===Hiatus and the death of Layne Staley (1998<U+2013>2002)===

Cantrell wanted to keep the band together and tried to stay in touch with Staley, but it became clear that Staley's health would not allow him to return to work any time soon. Cantrell continued writing  and recording, releasing his first solo album in 1998, entitled ''[[Boggy Depot]]''. Due to the significant contributions of Inez, Kinney and [[Record producer|producer]] Toby Wright to the album, many fans consider ''Boggy Depot'' to be a 'lost' Alice in Chains album.<ref name="AIC INFO">{{cite web| url=http://www.buyselltix.com/concerts/artistInfo/aliceInChainsInfo.php |title=Alice in Chains - Buy Sell Tix |publisher=Buyselltix.com |accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref>

In 1998, Staley reunited with the other members of the group for what would be the last time to record two new songs, "[[Get Born Again]]" and "[[Died (Alice in Chains song)|Died]]".<ref name="Last two songs">{{cite web| url=http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Alice-Chains/dp/B0001LYH7U?tag=dogpile-20 |title=The Essential Alice in Chains |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref> These songs were released in the fall of 1999 on the career-spanning [[box set]], ''[[Music Bank]]''. The set contains 48 songs, including rarities, old demos, the two new recordings, and a majority of the album cuts. The group also released ''[[Nothing Safe: Best of the Box]]'', which served as a 15-song sampler of ''Music Bank'', as well as their first [[greatest hits]] compilation. A [[live album]], simply titled ''[[Live (Alice in Chains)|Live]]'', and a second greatest hits compilation, titled ''[[Greatest Hits (Alice in Chains)|Greatest Hits]]'' are the group's last official releases.<ref name="Last albums">{{cite web| url=http://www.still-in-chains.de.vu/ |title=Released Albums |publisher=Stillinchains.com |accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref>

Although the band never officially disbanded, Staley spiraled deeper into depression when his girlfriend died from [[bacterial endocarditis]] in 1996. He became a [[recluse]], rarely leaving his Seattle [[condominium]].<ref name="Staley Bio from wierd site">{{cite web| url=http://www.finitesite.com/layne/bio.htm |title=Layne Staley Biography |publisher=Finitesite.com |accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref> The possibility of a full Alice in Chains reunion finally ended on [[2002-04-19]], when Staley was found dead in his condominium. The coroner approximated Staley's day of death as April 5, which, coincidentally, was the same date of fellow grunge musician [[Kurt Cobain]]'s death eight years earlier.<ref name="VH1 Staley tribute">{{cite web| url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1453544/04222002/alice_in_chains.jhtml |title='An Angry Angel' <U+2014> Layne Staley Remembered By Bandmates, Friends |publisher=[[VH1]] |date=[[2002-04-22]] |author=D'Angelo, Joe |accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref>

Cantrell, shaken by the death of his friend and bandmate, dedicated his second solo album released in 2002, entitled ''[[Degradation Trip]]'', to Staley.  The album was released nearly two months after Staley died as a single-disc release and was later re-released, as a two disc set with bonus songs.<ref name="Roadrunner Cantrell">{{cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.co.uk/artists/JerryCantrell/ |title=Well Worth The Trip |date=[[2002-12-24]] |publisher=Roadruuner Records UK |accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref>

===Reunion (2005<U+2013>present)===

In 2005, Cantrell, Inez, and Kinney reunited to perform a [[benefit concert]] in Seattle for victims of the [[tsunami disaster]] that struck south Asia.<ref name="Benefit concert">{{cite web| author=Hay, Travis |date=[[2005-02-21]] |url=http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/pop/212872_alice21q.html |title=Alice in Chains owns stage in tsunami-relief show full of surprises |publisher=Seattlepi.com'|accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref> The band included former [[Damageplan]] lead singer [[Pat Lachman]] as their lead vocalist. Special guests included, [[Wes Scantlin]] of [[Puddle of Mudd]] and [[Maynard James Keenan]] of [[Tool (band)|Tool]] to assist with vocals, and [[Ann Wilson]] of [[Heart (band)|Heart]] to sing backing vocals on "Brother".<ref name="AIC guests">{{cite web| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10518215/latest_news_jayz_the_strokes_r_kelly_and_more |title=Metallica man joins Alice in Chains |publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]'' |date=[[2006-06-09]] |accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref><ref name="Benefit concert"/>

On [[2006-03-06]], the surviving members of Alice in Chains performed at the VH1's [[Decades Rock Live]] concert honoring fellow Seattle rockers Ann and [[Nancy Wilson (guitarist)|Nancy Wilson]] of Heart. At the concert they performed their own songs, "[[Would?]]" (with [[Pantera]]/[[Down (band)|Down]] vocalist [[Phil Anselmo]]) and "[[Rooster (song)|Rooster]]" (with [[William DuVall]] and Ann Wilson).<ref name="AIC guests"/> The band followed it with a short United States club tour, several festival dates in Europe, and a brief tour of Japan. To coincide with the band's reunion, [[Sony Music]] released the long-delayed third Alice in Chains compilation, ''[[The Essential Alice in Chains]]'', a [[double album]] that included 28 songs.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Alice-Chains/dp/samples/B0001LYH7U/ref=dp_tracks_all_1#disc_1 |title=The Essential Alice in Chains |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref>

During the band's reunion shows, they enlisted [[Comes With the Fall]]'s [[William DuVall]], who previously performed with Cantrell's solo band, to sing lead vocals. [[Velvet Revolver]]'s [[Duff McKagan]] joined the band for the tour, playing rhythm guitar on a few songs.<ref name="AIC guests"/>

Before the tour, Kinney mentioned in an interview that he would be interested in writing new material, but not as Alice in Chains.<ref name="MTV reunion article"/> However, AliceinChains.com reported that the band has began writing new material, with DuVall singing lead vocals. The band plan to release their first studio album since the 1995 album ''Alice in Chains'', by the end of [[2008]].<ref>{{cite web| |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=84801 |title=Alice in Chains Will 'Definitely Possibly' Release Studio Album In 2008 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=[[2007-11-14]] |accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref>

Greg Prato of All Music Guide stated, "They were hard enough for metal fans, yet their dark subject matter and punky attack placed them among the front ranks of the Seattle-based grunge bands".<ref name="All Music Guide"/> The band's debut album ''Facelift'' was described as, "a fusion of grunge, metal, alternative rock and a hint of jazz". ''Dirt'' was praised as, "without a doubt one of the darkest and best albums of the 90<U+2019>s".<ref name="isound"/>

Staley's singing style has been described as, "distinct" and "thick as a brick", by Joe D'Angelo of [[MTV]] news.<ref name="Staley dead-VH1"/> Cantrell's musical style is described as "slow, brooding minor-key grinds topped with flat vocal harmonies".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/review/14253942 |title=Degradation Trip Review |publisher=[[All Music Guide]] |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |accessdate=2007-12-08}}</ref> Katherine Turman of [[Amazon.com]] commented on Cantrell's debut solo album ''Boggy Depot'', "Jerry Cantrell is a brutal emotional exorcism, the brooding and insinuating music perfectly suited to the pained and pointed lyrics".<ref>{{cite web| author=Turman, Katherine |url=http://www.amazon.com/Degradation-Trip-Jerry-Cantrell/dp/B0000655YW?tag=dogpile-20 |title=Amazon.com Editorial reviews - Boggy Depot |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=2007-12-08}}</ref>
