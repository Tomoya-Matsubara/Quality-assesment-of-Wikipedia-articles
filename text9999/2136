'''HMS ''Resolute''''' was a mid-19th century [[barque]]-rigged ship of the British [[Royal Navy]], specially outfitted for  [[Arctic]] exploration.  ''Resolute'' became trapped in the ice and was abandoned.  Recovered by an American [[whaler]], she was returned to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in 1856. Timbers from the ship were later used to construct a [[Resolute desk|desk]] which was then presented to the [[President of the United States]]. 

== History ==

In the face of rising concerns on the fate of the Arctic expedition of [[Sir John Franklin]], which had left Britain in 1845 in search of the [[North West Passage]] and had not been heard from since, by 1848 the [[British Government]] began sending expeditions in search of it.  Few existing warships being deemed suitable, six merchant ships were purchased between 1848 and 1850 and converted into exploration ships: two were steamships (HMS ''[[HMS Pioneer (1850)|Pioneer]]'' and ''[[HMS Intrepid (1850)|Intrepid]]''), the other four (HMS ''Resolute'', ''[[HMS Assistance (1850)|Assistance]]'', ''[[HMS Enterprise (1848)|Enterprise]]'' and ''[[HMS Investigator (1848)|Investigator]]'') being seagoing sailing ships.

''Resolute'' was formerly the [[barque]] ''Ptarmigan'' built on the [[River Tyne|Tyne]], which was purchased on 21 February 1850 and initially commissioned into the [[Royal Navy]] as HMS ''Refuge'', but was renamed HMS ''Resolute'' a month later. The ship was fitted for Arctic service by Green's [[Blackwall Yard]], with especially strong timbers, an internal heating system, and a polar bear as a figurehead.<ref name="proceedings"/>  

During 1850-51 HMS ''Resolute'' (flag-ship), ''Assistance'', ''Pioneer'' and ''Intrepid'', supported by a store-ship, the former warship HMS ''[[HMS North Star (1824)|North Star]]'', searched the eastern Arctic under the overall command of [[Horatio Thomas Austin]].  The only positive trace of Franklin they found was the remains of his first winter camp on [[Beechey Island]].  Meanwhile HMS ''Investigator'' and ''Enterprise'' were sent to search the Arctic from the west via the [[Bering Straits]], but also returned unsuccessful.

Between October 1850 and March 1851, members of the ''Resolute'' crew under Captain Horatio Austin published at least five numbers of a handwritten newspaper, "The Illustrated Arctic News," during the wintering of the ''Resolute'' in what the editors identified as the "Barrow Strait." Upon the return of the ''Resolute'' to home port in England, the manuscript paper was printed in London in 1852. Atwood (1997) references extant copies of the papers at both the British Museum and the Scott Polar Research Institute, Cambridge.<ref>Roy Alden Atwood (1997).

After returning to England all six vessels were reprovisioned and sent back to their respective search areas, the four eastern Arctic expedition ships including ''Resolute'' and their tender ''North Star'' being under the overall command of Sir [[Edward Belcher]]. They crossed [[Baffin Bay]] westward in June 1852 while ''Investigator'' and ''Enterprise'' explored the Northwest Passage eastward from Alaska.<ref name="proceedings"/>  Each ship took a different route to search for evidence of Frankin's lost ships ''Erebus'' and ''Terror''.  Only the ''Enterprise'' found any trace of them - a small quantity of timber on the eastern coast of [[Victoria Island]], and was ultimately the only one of the six ships to survive the Arctic.<ref name="proceedings"/>  

''Resolute'' became beset in the [[Arctic]] [[sea ice|ice]] and wintered off [[Dealy Island]] near the north shore of [[Viscount Melville Sound]].<ref name="proceedings"/>   In August 1853 a storm moved the ice flows with the entrapped ''Resolute'' eastward from the Dealy Island base.<ref name="proceedings"/>  ''Resolute'' was still beset by ice in the spring of 1854.<ref name="proceedings"/>  In May Captain Keller stowed the sails below, caulked down the hatches, and left ''Resolute'' locked in ice to lead his men in a hard march across the ice to reach other ships of the expedition.  Their number included the crew of HMS ''Investigator'', who had [[McClure Arctic Expedition|marched overland]] to the ''Resolute'' after abandoning their own vessel in May 1853.<ref name="proceedings"/>

The three other main vessels of Belcher's fleet were also abandoned late in August 1854 and the crews taken on board HMS ''North Star'', which had been moored in a less ice-bound position off Beechey Island.  Most were transferred to the relief ships HMS ''[[HMS Phoenix (1832)|Phoenix]]'' and ''[[HMS Talbot (1824)|Talbot]]'' which arrived at Beechey Island just as the overcrowded ''North Star'' was about to sail.

The British Government announced in ''The London Gazette'' that the ships, including ''Resolute'', were still Her Majesty's property, but no salvage was attempted.<ref name="proceedings"/> 

On 10 September 1855, the abandoned ''Resolute'' was found adrift in an [[ice flow]] off Cape Walsingham of [[Baffin Island]], some {{convert|1200|mi|km}} from where she had been abandoned, by the American [[whaler]] ''George Henry'', captained by [[James Buddington]] of [[Groton, Connecticut]].<ref name="proceedings"/> The Americans freed ''Resolute'' from the ice, re-rigged the spars and sails, and arrived at [[New London, Connecticut]] on 24 December 1855.<ref name="proceedings"/> The British government waived all claims to the ship upon learning of its arrival in New London.<ref name="proceedings"/>

Although most of the expeditions seeking the lost Franklin expedition before 1856 were funded by either the British government or by public subscription from within the British Empire, two expeditions were funded by [[Henry Grinnell]], a New York merchant and shipowner who had grown up in New Bedford, with additional United States government assistance. Grinnell convinced the [[United States government]] to restore ''Resolute'' and return her to [[England]] as a gesture of "national courtesy". The [[United States Congress]] bought her for $40,000 and then had her refitted and sailed to England under the command of Commander [[Henry J. Hartstene]] USN, where she was presented to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] on 17 December 1856 as a token of comity.<ref name="proceedings"/>

Both Grinnell and [[Jane Griffin|Lady Jane Franklin]] had hoped that the restored ''Resolute'' would be employed for a further search for the Franklin expedition, but evidence found by [[John Rae (explorer)|John Rae]] having proved beyond any reasonable doubt that the men were all dead, the British government declined. Instead, Lady Franklin organised another private expedition under [[Francis Leopold McClintock]], which in 1859 located the only written account of the fate of Franklin.

HMS ''Resolute'' served in the Royal Navy through the [[American Civil War]] and was retired and broken up in 1879.<ref name="proceedings"/>

The [[Canada|Canadian]] settlement of [[Resolute, Nunavut]], is named for ''Resolute''.

In March, 2009, British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] presented US President [[Barack Obama]] with the framed commission of HMS ''Resolute'', and a pen holder made from the wood of another Royal Navy ship, {{HMS|Gannet|1878|6}}.

== The ''Resolute'' desks ==
{{main|Resolute desk}}
The British government ordered at least two desks to be made from the timbers of the ship; constructed by cabinet makers at the Joiner's Shop of Chatham Dockyard. A large partner's desk was presented to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in 1880 as a gesture of thanks for the rescue and return of ''Resolute''.<ref name="proceedings"/>  Since then, the desk - known as the [[Resolute desk|''Resolute'' desk]] - has been used by every President except [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]], [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Gerald Ford]]. Most Presidents have used it as their official desk in the [[Oval Office]], but some have had it in their private study in the [[Executive Residence]].  [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was the first to remove it from the Oval Office, and it was returned to the Oval Office first by [[John F. Kennedy]] and then by [[Jimmy Carter]].<ref name="proceedings"/>

A second desk called the Grinnell Desk, or the Queen Victoria Desk, was also made from the timbers of HMS ''Resolute''. This smaller lady's desk was presented to the widow of Henry Grinnell in 1880 in recognition of her husband's generous contributions to the search for Franklin. It was given to the [[New Bedford Whaling Museum]] in 1983, and is currently in their collection in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]].

Accounts of dubious provenance state that one or more additional desks were made from ''Resolute'' timbers. In fact a third desk was commissioned by [[Queen Victoria]], though it appears it was never housed at [[Buckingham Palace]]. This desk was eventually used aboard the Royal Yacht ''[[Victoria & Albert]]''. It remains part of the [[Royal Collection]] and is now on long-term loan to the [[Royal Naval Museum]] in Portsmouth.

== HMS ''Resolute'' in popular media  ==

*A [[Resolute (novel)|book of the same name]] is about the discovery of ''Resolute'' by the whaler ''George Henry''.

*HMS ''Resolute''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> story is an integral clue in the plot of the film ''[[National Treasure: Book of Secrets]]''. The relevance of the two desks to the discovery of further clues is concealed in the [[<U+00CE>le_des_Cygnes#Statue of Liberty|version of the Statue of Liberty upon the <U+00CE>le des Cygnes]] in Paris, France. The anecdote ''"These twins stand resolute to preserve what we are looking for."'' refers to the twin Resolute desks made from the ship's timbers, with one located in located in [[The White House]] and the other in [[Buckingham Palace]].
