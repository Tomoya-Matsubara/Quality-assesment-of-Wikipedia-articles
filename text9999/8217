The '''February 2009 tornado outbreak''' was a tornado outbreak that primarily affected portions of the [[South Central United States]] on February 10, as well as [[Eastern United States|eastern sections]] of the United States on February 11. During the two-day span, 15&nbsp;tornadoes touched down in seven different states;[[Oklahoma]] was struck by six, the most of any state. The first day of the outbreak proved to be the most active regarding tornadoes, while the second brought mainly high wind damage.

The outbreak occurred after a storm system moved across the [[four corners]] region into the central and southern [[Great Plains]] during the afternoon of February 10. A moist low-level [[air mass]] moved to the north across [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]] into eastern Oklahoma and the [[Ozarks]]. Daytime heating of the moistening [[Planetary boundary layer|boundary layer]] increased through the afternoon across Oklahoma and Texas and combined with cooling aloft in conjunction with the approaching storm system, the air mass began to [[Atmospheric instability|destabilized]], which resulted in conditions supportive of thunderstorm development. A strong wind field, increasing with height through the lower [[troposphere]], resulted in favorable [[wind shear]] for rotation in the thunderstorms. The risk of tornadoes was down significantly for February 11, as stronger [[weather front|frontal]] forcing limited discrete supercell activity and lowered the instability in the air mass. However, a [[squall line]] developed during the day and produced four tornadoes.

The most devastating tornado of the outbreak was an [[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF4]] tornado that traveled through four counties in Oklahoma during the evening hours of February 10. It killed eight people and injured 46&nbsp;others, as well as destroy 114&nbsp;residences in [[Lone Grove, Oklahoma|Lone Grove]]. The Lone Grove tornado is the deadliest to hit Oklahoma since May 3, 1999 and the strongest tornado during the month of February in Oklahoma since 1950.

==Synopsis==
[[File:Day1otlk 20090210 1200 prt.gif|thumb|right|Convective outlook for February 10]]
During the afternoon hours of February 10, A strong middle and upper storm system moved across the [[four corners]] region and emerged into the central and southern [[Great Plains]]. A moist low-level [[air mass]] streamed northward across [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]] into eastern [[Oklahoma]] and the [[Ozarks]] ahead of the system. Daytime heating of the moistening [[Planetary boundary layer|boundary layer]] increased through the afternoon across Oklahoma and Texas as cloud cover shifted eastward. Along with cooling aloft in conjunction with the approaching storm system, the air mass began [[Atmospheric instability|destabilizing]], resulting in the development of thunderstorms. A very strong wind field that increased with height through the lower [[troposphere]] resulted in favorable [[wind shear]] for rotation in the thunderstorms.<ref name="PSWO1"/>

As a result, large [[hail]], damaging winds along with the potential for strong tornadoes was expected as thunderstorms developed from central Oklahoma southward into north central Texas in the afternoon hours. During the night, a [[cold front]] moved eastward toward the [[Mississippi Valley]] and organized the thunderstorms into a [[squall line]]. Along with a continued threat for hail and tornadoes, the risk of damaging winds increased.<ref name="PSWO1">{{cite web| publisher =[[Storm Prediction Center]]| title =Severe Thunderstorms Expected Over Parts of the Southern Plains into the Mid and Lower Mississippi Valley this Afternoon and Tonight| date =February 10, 2009| url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2009/pwo_200902101717.html | accessdate =February 14, 2009}}</ref> As a result, the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a moderate risk for severe weather for portions of eastern Oklahoma, northeastern Texas, western [[Arkansas]], and northwest Louisiana.<ref>{{cite web| publisher =Storm Prediction Center| title =Day 1 Convective Outlook for February 10, 2009| date =February 10, 2009| url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2009/day1otlk_20090210_1200.html | accessdate =February 10, 2009}}</ref>

At around 1 pm [[Central Time Zone (Americas)|CST]] (1900 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), Violent thunderstorms began developing near the [[Wichita Mountains]] in [[Comanche County, Oklahoma|Comanche County]]. The [[supercell]] thunderstorm that would produce the first tornado of the outbreak moved northeast through [[Caddo County, Oklahoma|Caddo]] and [[Grady County, Oklahoma|Grady]] counties over the next 30 to 45 minutes, before reaching southeastern [[Canadian County, Oklahoma|Canadian County]] at around 2 pm CST (2000 UTC).<ref name="SYN">{{cite web| publisher=[[National Weather Service]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma]]| title=February 10, 2009 Tornadoes: How It Happened| date=February 19, 2009| url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/wxevents/20090210/eventnarrative.php | accessdate=February 24, 2009}}</ref> By 2:14 pm CST (2014 UTC), it was beginning to develop a [[hook echo]], and the hook echo was fully developed four minutes later.

The tornado dissipated north of the Logan County Line at 3:05 pm CST (2105 UTC).<ref name="SYN"/>

The supercell produced three other tornadoes as it continued to move northeast. The first tornado occurred northwest of [[Meridian, Logan County, Oklahoma|Meridian]] in Logan County at 3:26 pm CST (2136 UTC). The fourth tornado produced by the supercell developed near [[Langston, Oklahoma|Langston]] in Logan County and moved to about {{convert|4|mi|km}} southwest of [[Stillwater, Oklahoma|Stillwater]] in [[Payne County, Oklahoma|Payne County]].

[[File:Oklahoma city tornado February 10 2009.jpg|right|thumb|150px|An EF1 tornado near [[Oklahoma City]]]]
The most significant tornado of the outbreak first touched down in southeast [[Jefferson County, Oklahoma|Jefferson County]] at about 6:50 pm CST (0050 UTC) near the [[Red River (Mississippi watershed)|Red River]]. The tornado crossed through rural areas as it moved to the northeast into [[Love County, Oklahoma|Love County]], before going into [[Carter County, Oklahoma|Carter County]] at 7:10 pm CST (0110 UTC). The tornado continued moving to the northeast for the next 15 minutes, before striking [[Lone Grove, Oklahoma|Lone Grove]].<ref name="SYN"/> It came close to hitting the Newport Mesonet station as it passed through Lone Grove, before crossing [[Interstate 35]] just north of the Prairie Valley Road exit. The tornado tracked through rural areas of northeastern Carter County to the east of [[Springer, Oklahoma|Springer]], and eventually crossed into southern [[Murray County, Oklahoma|Murray County]], ending southeast of [[Dougherty, Oklahoma|Dougherty]] at 8:00 pm CST (0200 UTC).<ref name="SYN"/>

The Storm Prediction Center also issued a very large slight risk area for February 11 which encompassed parts of the [[Deep South]], [[Ohio Valley]], [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], and [[Appalachians]].  The risk for tornadoes was lower on February 11 due to stronger [[weather front|frontal]] forcing, which limited discrete supercell activity, and lower instability.<ref>{{cite web   | title =Feb 11, 2009 0100 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook   | publisher =Storm Prediction Center | date =February 11, 2009  | url =http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2009/day1otlk_20090211_0100.html | accessdate=February 11, 2009 }}</ref> The slight risk was later upgraded to a moderate risk as a powerful [[squall line]] developed.<ref>{{cite web   | title =Feb 11, 2009 2000 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook    | publisher =Storm Prediction Center  | date =February 11, 2009  | url =http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2009/day1otlk_20090211_2000.html | accessdate =February 11, 2009 }}</ref>
