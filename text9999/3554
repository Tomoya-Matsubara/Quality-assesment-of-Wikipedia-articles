}}'''William the Carpenter''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1087<U+2013>1102), [[viscount]] of [[Melun]], was a French [[Nobility|noble]]man who participated in the ''[[Reconquista]]'' in Spain and on the [[First Crusade]]. He was notorious for defecting from the army both in Spain and on the crusade, but he was also known for his strength in battle, whence he earned his nickname "the Carpenter." He returned to the Holy Land after the crusade, and nothing further is known of his life or death.

===Succession===
His specific origins are unclear; according to the seventeenth-century genealogist [[P<U+00E8>re Anselme]], he was the son of Ursio I, viscount of Melun, a town about 50 kilometres outside Paris in the [[Brie (region)|Brie region]] of the [[French Vexin]], which was later known as the [[<U+00CE>le-de-France (province)|<U+00CE>le-de-France]]. Anselme believed William succeeded his father in 1084, and was later succeeded by his own son, Ursio II.<ref>[[P<U+00E8>re Anselme|Anselme de Sainte-Marie]], ''[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k76078s.zoom.r=Histoire+g%C3%A9n%C3%A9alogique+et+chronologique+de+la+maison+royale.f229.langEN# Histoire G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>alogique et Chronologique de la Maison Royale de France, des Pairs, Grands Officiers de la Couronne et de la Maison du Roy et des anciens Barons du Royaume]'' (Reproduction de l'<U+00E9>d. de Paris: chez Estienne Loyson, 1674: Num. BNF de l'<U+00E9>d. de Paris: Biblioth<U+00E8>que Nationale de France, 1987. 1 microfilm Reproduction de l'<U+00E9>d. de Paris: Compagnie des libraires associ<U+00E9>s, 1730); vol. 5, "G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>alogie de la Maison de Melun.", p. 221.</ref> However, in the nineteenth century, Adolphe Duchalais showed that Anselme misread the [[charter]]s he was using; all that is known for certain is that Ursio was viscount in 1085 and William was viscount in 1094. There is no definite record of an Ursio II, and after William there is no viscount known until Adam, who married the daughter of the previous, unnamed viscount in 1138. William was presumably related to Ursio but his specific relationship to him and the other viscounts is unknown.<ref> Duchalais, Adolphe "[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bec_0373-6237_1845_num_6_1_451831 Charte inedit<U+00E9> de l'an 1138, relative <U+00E0> l'histoire des vicomtes de Melun]" (Biblioth<U+00E8>que de l<U+2019><U+00E9>cole des chartes; vol. 6 no. 6, 1845), pp. 253<U+2013>255.</ref>

According to twelfth-century chronicler [[Robert the Monk]], William was "of royal stock" and was related to [[Hugh I, Count of Vermandois]] and Hugh's brother King [[Philip I of France]].<ref>Sweetenham, Carol (tr.) (2005) ''Robert the Monk's History of the First Crusade = Historia Iherosolimitana''. Aldershot: Ashgate; iv.XII, p. 128.</ref>

===Military exploits===
According to twelfth-century monk [[Guibert of Nogent]], William was "powerful in words, but less so in action...a man who set out to do things too great for him."<ref>[[Guibert of Nogent]]; Levine, Robert (tr.) (1997) ''The Deeds of God Through the Franks''. Woodbridge: Boydell Press; bk. iv, p. 79.</ref> William was a member of the French contingent which marched into Spain in 1087 to assist [[Alfonso VI of Castile]] with the siege of [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]] against the [[Almoravids]]. He may have been one of the leaders, along with [[Eudes I, Duke of Burgundy]], who was the nephew of Alfonso's wife [[Constance of Burgundy|Constance]]. The French army never made it to Tudela and withdrew with little success.<ref>Reilly, Bernard F. (1988) ''The Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n-Castilla under King Alfonso VI, 1065-1109''. Princeton University Press; p. 191.</ref><ref>[[Jonathan Riley-Smith|Riley-Smith, Jonathan]] (1997) ''The First Crusaders, 1095-1131''. Cambridge University Press; p. 43.</ref> Guibert says that William "retreated like a wretch, leaving countless men stranded by his flight."<ref>Guibert of Nogent (1997), p. 79.</ref> William's actions in Spain may have been the inspiration for the character of [[Ganelon]] in the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'', which was possibly written in the early twelfth-century, based on similar events that had occurred during the reign of [[Charlemagne]] centuries earlier.<ref>Defourneaux, Marcelin (1949) ''Les Fran<U+00E7>ais en Espagne aux XIe et XIIe si<U+00E8>cles''. Paris: Presses universitaires de France; p. 269.</ref> 

In France, Guibert says he engaged in petty warfare against other nobles and "criminal looting" of the countryside, in contravention of the [[Peace and Truce of God]]. In 1096 he joined the First Crusade, and "took from his poor neighbors the little that they had to provide himself shamefully with provisions for the journey."<ref>Guibert of Nogent (1997), p. 79.</ref> He participated in the [[Persecution of Jews in the First Crusade|attacks on Jews]] at [[Mainz]], led by [[Emicho|Emich of Flonheim]].<ref>Riley-Smith, Jonathan (2005) ''The Crusades: a history'', 2nd ed. New Haven: Yale University Press, p. 28.</ref> Emich's army later battled against the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarians]], during which William "beheaded the chief of the Hungarian army, who was a member of the <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Coloman of Hungary|King Coloman's]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> counsel, a distinguished man with dazzling snow-white hair."<ref>[[Albert of Aachen]]; Edgington, Susan B. (ed. & tr.) (2007) ''Historia Ierosolimitana''. Oxford University Press; I.29, p. 55.</ref> After the dispersal of Emich's army following this battle, William and the other French leaders joined the army of his relative [[Hugh of Vermandois]].<ref>Riley-Smith, ''The Crusades'', p. 28.</ref> Hugh's army marched south into Italy, and at [[Bari]], Hugh sent William across the sea to [[Dyrrhachium]] as an ambassador to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] governor of the city.<ref>[[Steven Runciman|Runciman, Steven]] (1951) ''A History of the Crusades, vol. I: The First Crusade''. London: Folio Society, 1994, p. 120 (originally published: Cambridge U. P., 1951). Runciman's account is derived from [[Anna Comnena]], who calls William "Tzerpentarios", a Greek rendering of his French nickname. Anna Comnena; Sewter, E.R.A (tr.) (1969), ''[[Alexiad]]''. Penguin, p. 314.</ref> William then travelled to [[Constantinople]] with Hugh, and he was among the men who came to meet [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] when Godfrey arrived at the city later in the year.<ref>Albert of Aachen (2007), II.9, p. 75.</ref> 
[[Image:Capture of Antioch by Bohemond of Tarente in June 1098.JPG|thumb|300px|Capture of Antioch by Bohemond of Taranto. Painting by L. Gallait, 1840.|left|alt=A painting of the capture of Antioch by Bohemond of Taranto, by L. Gallait, 1840.]]
No further mention of William is made until the [[Siege of Antioch]] in 1098. The crusaders had successfully taken the city, but were then besieged themselves by a large Muslim army led by [[Kerbogha]] of [[Mosul]]. The crusaders suffered from lack of supplies, and there were many desertions; William fled Antioch in January 1098, along with the French monk [[Peter the Hermit]], who had led his own army to Constantinople before the main crusaders arrived there. William was probably a member of [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]]'s army at this point, because Bohemond sent his nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]] to find them, and they were brought back to Bohemond's camp.<ref>[[Thomas Asbridge|Asbridge, Thomas]] (2004) ''[[The First Crusade: A New History]]''. Oxford University Press; pp. 178<U+2013>179.</ref> Robert the Monk assumes that William fled because "he had never before experienced such suffering from hunger."<ref>Robert the Monk (2005), p. 128.</ref> William "spent the whole of the night...in Bohemond's tent, lying on the ground like a piece of rubbish." Bohemond rebuked him as a "wretched disgrace to the whole Frankish army", and mentioned his desertion of the French army in Spain in 1087. The other leaders asked Bohemond to spare him and William suffered no further punishment. However, William was so ashamed that he deserted the army again.<ref>Hill, Rosalind T. (ed. and trans.) (1967) ''[[Gesta Francorum]]: the Deeds of the Franks and the Other Pilgrims to Jerusalem''. London: Oxford University Press; pp. 33<U+2013>34. August C. Krey's translation of the passage in ''The First Crusade: the accounts of eyewitnesses and participants'' (Princeton, 1921, pp. 136<U+2013>139) can be found at the [[Internet Medieval Sourcebook]], "[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/gesta-cde.html#antioch2 The Sufferings of the Crusaders - 3. The Gesta Version]". Guibert was not as forgiving as Robert, but he also gives hunger as the excuse for William's second flight (Guibert of Nogent (1997), pg. 81).</ref> 

[[Albert of Aachen]] says William's second desertion occurred in June of 1098, along with William of Grand-Mesnil, a relative of Bohemond. On the road away from Antioch, they joined [[Stephen II, Count of Blois|Stephen of Blois]], another leader of the crusade who had also fled the siege. They travelled back towards Constantinople, but on the way met Emperor [[Alexius I Comnenus]], who was advancing to Antioch with a relief army. They convinced him of the futility of the crusader siege and the emperor turned back to Constantinople.<ref>Albert of Aachen (2007), iv.39<U+2013>40, pp. 311<U+2013>313.</ref>

William apparently returned to the Holy Land in the [[Crusade of 1101]]. The First Crusade had successfully conquered Jerusalem, and those who had returned home before completing the journey were often shamed into going on crusade a second time; some of them, like Stephen of Blois, were killed on their second journey.<ref>Riley-Smith, Jonathan (1986) ''The First Crusade and the Idea of Crusading''. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press; p. 120.</ref> William, however, survived to participate in the politics of the newfound [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]; he was among the men who petitioned [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|King Baldwin I]] to restore [[Daimbert of Pisa]] as [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]]. He was also present at Baldwin I's siege of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]] in 1102.<ref>Albert of Aachen, ix.14-15, p. 655.</ref> William may have settled in the north, in the crusader [[Principality of Antioch]] as a vassal of Bohemond, because he appears as a witness in a charter from Antioch in 1101.<ref>Riley-Smith (1986), p. 72. The charter is in [[Reinhold R<U+00F6>hricht]], ''Regesta Regni Hierosolimitani''; no. 35, p. 5.</ref>

==Nickname==
William's actions at the Siege of Antioch are known from the ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'', an anonymous chronicle written by an [[Italo-Norman]] eyewitness. The ''Gesta'' was very popular in Europe after the crusade, but was considered crudely written by more refined readers. It was later rewritten and expanded by more educated writers, including the French monks Robert and Guibert, both of whom were eager to add information about French crusaders like William. According to Robert, William "acquired the name of 'Carpenter' because nobody wanted to take him on in battle<U+2014>-there was no breastplate, helmet or shield which could withstand the shattering impact of his lance or sword."<ref>Robert the Monk, pp. 127<U+2013>128.</ref> Guibert says that he "was called the Carpenter, not because he was a craftsman in wood, but because he prevailed in battle like a carpenter, by cutting men down", and has Bohemond ask: "what kind of Carpenter did we have, who, like a construction-worker with a pick-axe, hacked away, with lances and swords, at the backs of the Gentiles?"<ref>Guibert of Nogent, pg. 80.</ref> Christopher Tyerman interprets this as William's "skills as a battlefield butcher".<ref>Tyerman, Christopher (2006) ''God's War: a new history of the Crusades''. London: Penguin Books; p. 87.</ref> [[Edward Gibbon]], apparently misunderstanding Guibert, thought the nickname came "from the weighty strokes of his [[battle axe|axe]]".<ref>[[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon, Edward]]; David Womersley (ed.) (1996) ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', vol. 3, Chapter LVIII, p. 598.</ref>
