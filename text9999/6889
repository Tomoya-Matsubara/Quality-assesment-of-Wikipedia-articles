'''Nadia Ali''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq| <U+0646><U+0627><U+062F><U+06CC><U+06C1> <U+0639><U+0644><U+06CC>}}}}) (born August 3, 1980 in [[Libya]]) is a [[Pakistani American]] [[singer-songwriter]], the former front-woman and songwriter of the band [[iiO]], whose 2001 hit ''[[Rapture (iiO song)|Rapture]]'' reached #2 on the UK Singles chart.

==Early years and iiO==
Nadia Ali was born in [[Libya]] to [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] parents in 1980. The family relocated to [[Queens]], [[New York City]], when she was still a child, and has remained there.<ref>[http://pakmanzil.wordpress.com/2006/11/24/nadia-ali-first-pakistani-american-electronic-diva/  Article on Pakistani Music and Musician Website "Pakmanzil"]</ref>

Ali has stated in interviews that the music that most influenced her growing up includes [[Stevie Nicks]], [[Sade (band)|Sade]], [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]], [[U2]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Carole King]], [[Carly Simon]] and [[The Beatles]].<ref>[http://people.uleth.ca/~t.wirch/iio_nadBio.htm  Nadia Ali Q & A on Pakistani Fansite]</ref>

A 17 year old Ali was working in the New York offices of [[Gianni Versace S.p.A.|Versace]], and aspiring to start a music career, when a co-worker introduced her to producer Markus Moser, who was looking for a female singer to collaborate on some of his original dance music production.<ref>[http://remixmag.com/artists/remix_iio/ Remix Magazine Interview with iiO]</ref>  The two teamed up and started a group that was originally named "Vaiio", named after the Sony laptop Nadia was working on.  They later dropped the "va" to avoid causing problems in the future with [[Sony]].  Working with Moser, she wrote the lyrics and the vocals for the songs.  After the success of the 2001 hit "[[Rapture (iiO song)|Rapture]]", the single was remixed many times by the likes of [[Armin Van Buuren]], [[John Creamer & Stephane K]] and [[Deep Dish]] with [[Mashup (music)|bootleg]] and [[white label]] remixes emerging as well.  The duo toured all over the world for years and released more singles, including "[[At the End]]", "[[Runaway (iiO song)|Runaway]]", "[[Smooth (iiO song)|Smooth]]" and "[[Kiss You]]".

Ali left the group in 2005 to pursue a solo career and released her debut album, ''[[Poetica]]'', in 2006, while Moser continues to release iiO material featuring her on vocals.  Most notably, these releases include the 2006 single "[[Is It Love?]]" which went to #1 in America on the Billboard Dance Chart, and the 2007 Album ''[[Reconstruction Time: The Best Of iiO Remixed]]''.

==Solo career==
After leaving iiO, Ali toured extensively and collaborated with prominent DJs and producers. The first, "Who is Watching", was a collaboration with DJ/Producer [[Armin Van Buuren]] which appeared on his 2005 album ''[[Shivers (album)|Shivers]]''. Followed by "Something to Lose" in 2006, a duet with singer-songwriter [[Rosko]], produced by [[Creamer & K]] and released by Ultra Records.  Championed on the UK's [[BBC Radio 1]] by influential DJ and tastemaker [[Pete Tong]],<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/dance/petetong/index.shtml BBC Radio 1: Pete Tong]</ref> the track was licensed to [[Roger Sanchez|Roger Sanchez's]] "Release Yourself vol. 5," as well as [[Sharam Tayebi]] of [[Deep Dish]] for his [[Global Underground]] debut ''[[GU029|Dubai]]''. Additionally, Nadia was featured on MTV Iggy in March 2009, where she recorded 3 live acoustic videos performing  "Rapture", "Crash and Burn" and "Love Story".
