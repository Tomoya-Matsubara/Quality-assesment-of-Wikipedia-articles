At 1.6 million acres (6,500&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) the '''Kaibab National Forest''' borders both the north and south rims of the [[Grand Canyon]], in north-central [[Arizona]]. It is divided into three major sections: the ''North Kaibab Ranger District'' (offices in [[Fredonia, Arizona|Fredonia]]) and the South Kaibab and are managed by [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]]. The South Kaibab is further divided into two forests, the ''Tusayan Ranger District'' (offices in [[Grand Canyon, Arizona|Grand Canyon]]), and the ''Williams Ranger District'' (offices in [[Williams, Arizona|Williams]]). The Grand Canyon is a natural boundary between the North Kaibab and the South Kaibab. The South Kaibab covers {{convert|1,422|sqmi|km2}} and the North Kaibab stretches over {{convert|1,010|sqmi|km2}}. Elevations vary on the forest from 5,500 feet (1,676 m) in the southwest corner to 10,418 feet (3,175 m) at the summit of [[Kendrick Peak]] on the Williams Ranger District. The forest as a whole is headquartered in Williams.

== North Kaibab ==
The [[Kaibab Plateau]] is an island surrounded by lower elevations. The plateau, with elevation up to 9,000 feet (2,700 m) is bordered on the south by the Grand Canyon, on the east and the west by tributary canyons of the [[Colorado River]], and on the North by tiers of uplifted cliffs.

===North Kaibab History===
The North Kaibab Ranger District was part of the lands withdrawn from the [[Public domain (land)|public domain]] in 1893 and included in the [[Grand Canyon Forest Reserve]]. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] created the Grand Canyon Game Preserve in 1906. The game preserve which includes {{convert|612,736|acre|km2}} of the Kaibab National Forest, is "set a side for the protection of game animals and birds," and is "to be recognized as a breeding place therefore." in 1908, the Forest Reserve north of the Grand Canyon, including the game preserve, was renamed Kaibab Nation Forest. In 1919, the Grand Canyon National Park was created from the forest service lands surrounding the Grand Canyon. In 1934, the [[Tusayan National Forest]] south of the Grand Canyon was consolidated into the Kaibab National Forest, forming the present forest boundaries. The forest area north of the canyon became the North Kaibab Ranger District. The headquarters for the Kaibab National Forest is in [[Williams, Arizona|Williams]], Arizona.

===North Kaibab Climate===

The climate of the North Kaibab, which encompasses the [[Kaibab Plateau]], is a snowy highland climate, qualifying as ''Csb'' under the [[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]], a type often described as [[Mediterranean climate#Warm-summer Mediterranean climate|Warm Summer]] [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]]. There are two weather stations in this area: Jacob Lake, which is near the center of the plateau, and Bright Angel Ranger Station, which is located at a more southerly location and is higher in altitude. The higher altitude is reflected in Bright Angel's cooler temperatures and increased precipitation versus Jacob Lake. Using the {{convert|0|C|0}} isotherm between temperate and continental climates preferred by some climatologists, Bright Angel Ranger Station is ''Dsb'', the dry-summer version of the [[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb/Dsb: Warm summer subtype|Warm Summer]] [[Humid continental climate|Humid Continental climate]]. The North Kaibab is unusual for either a ''Csb'' or ''Dsb'' climate, featuring lower precipitation in early summer, with July and August being wetter (courtesy of the [[North American Monsoon]]. This is followed by a slightly drier period during the autumn months, and then a wetter period from December to March. Summers in this area feature warm days and cool nights. Winters are chilly, especially at night, and snowy. Jacob Lake averages 105 inches of snow per annum, and Bright Angel Ranger Station 135 inches.

== Vegetation ==
[[File:NKRD Aspen.jpg|thumb|Aspen trees in fall colors, North Kaibab Ranger District]]
[[Vegetation]] in the forest varies by elevation and exposure. Principal tree species are [[ponderosa pine]], [[Douglas-fir]], [[Engelmann spruce]], [[aspen]], [[blue spruce]], [[oak]], [[pinyon pine]], and [[juniper]]. Among other things, they enhance the beauty of the landscape, hold soil in place, and provide cover and food for wildlife. As elevation decreases, trees give way to [[bitter brush]], [[Gambel oak]], [[sagebrush]], and [[cliffrose]]. Within the forest, there are irregular areas entirely free of tree growth.

== Wildlife ==
Commonly seen large wild animals include [[whitetail deer]], [[mule deer]], [[elk]], [[antelope]], [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] and [[coyote]].  [[Mountain lion]], [[bobcat]], and [[American black bear|black bear]] are seen less frequently.

Common small animals in Kaibab National Forest include [[chipmunk]]s, [[ground squirrel]]s and [[Abert's squirrel]]s. Less common are [[porcupine]]s, small [[lizard]]s, and [[rattlesnake]]s. Most common birds are [[bluebird]]s, [[American Robin|robins]], [[Steller's jay]]s, [[nuthatch]]es, [[Northern Flicker|flicker]]s and other [[woodpecker]]s,  [[crow]]s, various [[hummingbird]]s, [[raven]]s, and a variety of [[hawk]]s.  [[Bat]]s also occupy the park.

== Wilderness==
There are four designated [[wilderness area]]s in the Kaibab National Forest.  Two in the North Kaibab Ranger District and two in the Williams Ranger District. 
* [[Kanab Creek Wilderness]] ''(North Kaibab Ranger District)''
* [[Saddle Mountain Wilderness]] ''(North Kaibab Ranger District)''
* [[Kendrick Mountain Wilderness]] ''(Williams Ranger District)''
* [[Sycamore Canyon Wilderness]] ''(Williams Ranger District)''

[[File:Spring Valley Cabin, AZ.jpg|thumb|upright|Historic Spring Valley Cabin]]
The historic '''Spring Valley Cabin''', near [[Parks, Arizona]] in the Williams Ranger District,  is available for rentals  through the "Rooms with a View" Arizona Cabin Rental Program. The cabin was built in 1917. It served as the residence for rangers who worked at the guard station. The [[bunkhouse]] was the original office.<ref>[http://fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gDfxMDT8MwRydLA1cj72BTJw8jAwjQL8h2VAQAzHJMsQ!!/?ss=110307&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=FSE_003705&navid=110130000000000&pnavid=110000000000000&position=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&recid=11662&actid=101&ttype=recarea&pname=Kaibab%20National%20Forest%20-%20Spring%20Valley%20Cabin     Spring Valley Cabin] at Kaibab National Forest</ref>

Located one mile south of the [[Grand Canyon]], '''Hull Cabin''' is the oldest surviving historic cabin near the Grand Canyon<U+2019>s south rim. This rustic cabin was built in 1889 as part of a sheep ranch, and was acquired by the Forest Service in 1907 for use as a ranger station. In 1985, the cabin was listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Hull Cabin is also  available for rentals  through the "Rooms with a View" program.
