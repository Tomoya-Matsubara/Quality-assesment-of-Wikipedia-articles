'''''An Inconvenient Truth''''' is a [[2006 in film|2006]] [[documentary film]], directed by [[Davis Guggenheim]], about former [[Vice President of the United States|United States Vice President]] [[Al Gore]]'s campaign to educate citizens about [[global warming]] via a comprehensive slide show that, by his own estimate, he's given more than a thousand times.

Premiering at the [[2006 Sundance Film Festival]] and opening in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] on May 24, 2006, the documentary was a critical and box-office success, winning [[Academy Award]]s for Best Documentary Feature and for Best Original Song.<ref name="NY Times">{{cite web |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/342290/An-Inconvenient-Truth/awards |title=NY Times: An Inconvenient Truth |accessdate=2008-11-23|work=NY Times}}</ref> The film also earned $49 million at the [[box office]] worldwide, becoming the fifth-highest-grossing documentary film to date in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web

The idea to document his efforts came from [[Laurie David]] who saw his presentation at a 
town-hall meeting on global warming which coincided with the opening of ''[[The Day after Tomorrow]]''. David was so inspired by Gore's slide show that she, with [[Lawrence Bender]], met with Guggenheim to adapt the presentation into a film. Since the documentary's release, ''An Inconvenient Truth'' has been credited for raising international public awareness of [[climate change]] and reenergizing the [[environmental movement]].

== Synopsis ==
{{Anchors|Plot}}
''An Inconvenient Truth'' focuses on Al Gore and his travels in support of his efforts to educate the public about the severity of the climate crisis. Gore says, "I've been trying to tell this story for a long time and I feel as if I've failed to get the message across."<ref name='revkin-thefight'>{{cite news | first=Andrew | last=Revkin | coauthors= |authorlink= Andrew Revkin | title='An Inconvenient Truth': Al Gore's Fight Against Global Warming | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/22/movies/22gore.html | work =[[The New York Times]] | pages = | accessdate = 2009-11-02 | language = }}</ref> The film documents a [[Keynote (software)|Keynote]] presentation (dubbed "the slide show") that Gore has presented throughout the world. It intersperses Gore's exploration of data and predictions regarding [[climate change]] and its potential for disaster with his own life story.

The former vice president opens the film by greeting an audience with a joke: "I am Al Gore; I used to be the next President of the United States."<ref>{{cite news | first=Peter | last=Rainer | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Al Gore's global warning | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0526/p14s02-almo.html | work =[[The Christian Science Monitor]] | pages = | accessdate = 2009-11-03 | language = }}</ref> After laughter from the crowd, Gore begins his slide show on climate change; a comprehensive presentation replete with detailed graphs, flow charts and stark visuals. Gore shows off several majestic photographs of the Earth taken from multiple space missions, [[Earthrise]] and [[The Blue Marble]].<ref name='goreplaysleadingman'>{{cite news | first=Roger | last=Ebert | coauthors= |authorlink= Roger Ebert | title=Al Gore plays leading man | date=2006-05-28 | publisher= | url =http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060528/PEOPLE/605280306 | work =[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | pages = | accessdate = 2009-11-02 | language = }}</ref>  Gore notes that these photos dramatically transformed the way we see the Earth; helping spark modern environmentalism.

Following this, Gore shares vivid anecdotes that inspired his passion for the issue, including his college education with early climate expert [[Roger Revelle]] at [[Harvard University]], his sister's death from [[lung cancer]] and his young son's near-fatal car accident. Gore recalls a story from his grade school years, where a fellow student asked his geography teacher about [[continental drift]]; in response, the teacher called the concept the "most ridiculous thing [he'd] ever heard." Gore ties this conclusion to the assumption that "the Earth is so big, we can't possibly have any lasting, harmful impact on the Earth's environment." For comic effect, Gore uses a clip from the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[Crimes of the Hot]]" to describe the [[greenhouse effect]]. Gore refers to his loss to [[George W. Bush]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 United States presidential election]] as a "hard blow" yet subsequently "brought into clear focus, the mission [he] had been pursuing for all these years."

Al Gore points out that all of human history has happened on that tiny pixel, which is our only home.]]

Throughout the movie, Gore discusses the [[scientific opinion on climate change]], as well as the present and future [[effects of global warming]] and stresses that climate change "is really not a political issue, so much as a moral one,"<ref>{{cite news | first=Amanda | last=Geftner | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Review: An Inconvenient Truth | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=archive&ct=res&cd=1-0&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newscientist.com%2Farticle%2Fmg19125592.100-review-ian-inconvenient-truthi.html&ei=C4jvSpTiI4WBgAfLi9ScAQ&usg=AFQjCNHG7QMcDe21KgQBx682MGz5VxFDnw | work =New Scientist | pages = | accessdate = 2009-11-03 | language = }}</ref> describing the consequences he believes global climate change will produce if the amount of human-generated [[greenhouse gases]] is not significantly reduced in the very near future. Gore also presents [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] [[ice core|ice coring]] data showing CO<sub>2</sub> levels higher now than in the past 650,000 years.

The film includes segments intended to refute [[Scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming|critics]] who say that global warming is unproven or that warming will be insignificant. For example, Gore discusses the possibility of the collapse of a major [[ice sheet]] in [[Greenland]] or in [[West Antarctica]], either of which could raise global sea levels by approximately 20 feet (6 m), flooding coastal areas and producing 100 million refugees. Melt water from Greenland, because of its lower [[salinity]], could then halt the currents that keep northern Europe warm and quickly trigger dramatic local cooling there. It also contains various short animated projections of what could happen to different animals more vulnerable to climate change.

The documentary ends with Gore arguing that if appropriate actions are taken soon, the effects of global warming can be successfully reversed by releasing less [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] and planting more vegetation to consume existing CO<sub>2</sub>. Gore calls upon his viewers to learn how they can help him in these efforts. Gore concludes the film by saying, "Each one of us is a cause of global warming, but each one of us can make choices to change that with the things we buy, the electricity we use, the cars we drive; we can make choices to bring our individual carbon emissions to zero. The solutions are in our hands, we just have to have the determination to make it happen. We have everything that we need to reduce carbon emissions, everything but political will. But in America, the will to act is a renewable resource."<ref>{{cite book | last = Gallo | first = Carmine | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Fire them up!: 7 simple secrets to inspire colleagues, customers, and clients, sell yourself, your vision, and your values, communicate with charisma and confidence | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | date = 2007 | location = | pages = 92 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0470165669 }}</ref>

During the film's end credits, a [[diaporama]] pops up on screen suggesting to viewers things at home they can do to combat climate change, including, "recycle", "speak up in your community", "try to buy a [[hybrid vehicle]]" and "encourage everyone you know to watch this movie."<ref>{{cite book | last = Philander | first = S.

Gore's [[An Inconvenient Truth: The Planetary Emergency of Global Warming and What We Can Do About It|book of the same title]] was published concurrently with the theatrical release of the documentary. The book contains additional information, scientific analysis, and Gore's commentary on the issues presented in the documentary. A 2007 documentary entitled ''An Update with Former Vice President Al Gore'' features Gore discussing additional information that came to light after the film was completed, such as [[Hurricane Katrina]], [[coral reef]] depletion, glacial earthquake activity on the [[Greenland ice sheet]], [[wildfires]], and trapped methane gas release associated with [[permafrost]] melting.<ref name="Katrina">[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0978403/ An Update with Former Vice-President Al Gore (2006) (V)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

According to Gore, he became interested in global warming when he took a course at [[Harvard University]] with Professor [[Roger Revelle]], one of the first scientists to measure [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web | last=Voynar | first=Kim | title=Sundance: ''An Inconvenient Truth'' Q & A - Al Gore on fire!

=== The slide show ===
[[File:Al gore presentation.jpg|thumb|alt=A man is standing on a stage in front of a giant projection of the Earth|Gore presents his global warming slide show at the [[University of Miami]].]]
After his defeat in [[United States presidential election, 2000|the 2000 presidential election]] by [[George W. Bush]], Gore returned his focus to the topic. He edited and adapted a slide show he had compiled years earlier, and began featuring the slide show in presentations on global warming across the U.S. and around the world. At the time of the film, Gore estimated he had shown the presentation more than one thousand times.<ref>{{cite web | last=Breslau | first=Karen | title=The Resurrection of Al Gore | work=Wired Magazine | month=May | year=2006 | url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.05/gore_pr.html }}</ref>

{{quote|I had never seen it before, and I was floored. As soon as the evening's program concluded, I asked him to let me present his full briefing to leaders and friends in New York and Los Angeles. I would do all the organizing if he would commit to the dates. Gore's presentation was the most powerful and clear explanation of global warming I had ever seen. And it became my mission to get everyone I knew to see it too.}} Inspired, David assembled together a team, including producer Lawrence Bender and former president of [[eBay]] [[Jeffrey Skoll]], who met with Gore about the possibility of making the slide show into a movie. It took some convincing. The slide show, she says, "was his baby, and he felt proprietary about it and it was hard for him to let go." <ref name="goreleadingman" />

David said the box office returns weren't important to her. "None of us are going to make a dime." What is at stake, she says, "is, you know, the planet."<ref name="goreleadingman" />

David and Bender later met with director David Guggenheim, to have him direct the film adaptation of his slide show. Guggenheim, who was skeptical at first, later saw the presentation for himself, stating that he was "blown away," and "left after an hour and a half thinking that global warming [was] the most important issue...I had no idea how you<U+2019>d make a film out of it, but I wanted to try," he said.<ref>{{cite web

And in a movie, that element is just not present. He explained to me that you have to create that element on screen, by supplying a narrative thread that allows the audience to make a connection with one or more characters. He said, "You've got to be that character." So we talked about it, and as I say, by then he had earned such a high level of trust from me that he convinced me.}}

=== Production ===
When Bender first saw Gore's presentation, he said to himself: "<U+2018>OK, this is a movie. I know it can be made more visual, but we need to find a personal way in.' And that meant hours and hours and hours of interviews. At one point Gore said it felt like we were making <U+201C>Kill Al Vol. 3.<U+201D>"<ref name="lawrencebendertruthdig" />

"It was grueling, and we did it in a very short period of time," Bender says. "We followed him to China, we shot in [[Nashville]] [and] [[Stanford]]; we went all over the country. It was a lot of travel in a very short period of time. And they had to get this thing edited and cut starting in January, and ready to screen in May. That<U+2019>s like a seriously tight schedule. So the logistics of pulling it off with a low budget were really difficult, and if there<U+2019>s one person who gets credit, it<U+2019>s Leslie Chilcott, because she really pulled it together."<ref name='lawrencebendertruthdig'>{{cite news | first=Blair | last=Golson | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Lawrence Bender: The Truthdig Interview | date=2006-05-26 | publisher= | url =http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/20060526_lawrence_bender_interview/ | work =[[Truthdig]] | pages = | accessdate = 2009-09-14 | language = }}</ref>

==== Technical aspects ====
The majority of the movie exhibits Gore delivering his lecture to an audience at a relatively small theater in Los Angeles. Gore's presentation was delivered on a 70-foot digital screen that Bender commissioned specifically for the movie.<ref name="lawrencebendertruthdig" />

While the bulk of the film was shot on 4:4:4 [[HDCAM]], according to director Guggenheim, a vast array of different film formats were used: "There<U+2019>s [[35mm]] and [[16mm]]. A lot of the stuff on the farm I just shot myself on [[8mm film]]. We used four [[Sony F950]] HDCAMs for the presentation. We shot three different kinds of [[prosumer]] HD, both 30 and 24.

== Music ==
''An Inconvenient Truth'' was [[Sheet music|scored]] by [[Michael Brook]] with an accompanying theme song played during the end credits by [[Melissa Etheridge]]. Brook explained that he wanted to bring out the emotion expressed in the film: "...in Inconvenient Truth, there's a lot of information and it's kind of a lecture, in a way, and very well organized and very well presented, but it's a lot to absorb. And the director, Guggenheim, wanted to have - sort of give people a little break every once in a while and say, okay, you don't have to absorb this information, you can just sort of - and it was more the personal side of Al Gore's life or how it connected to the theme of the film. And that's when there's music."<ref name='michaelbrooknpr'>{{cite news | first=Liane | last=Hansen | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Michael Brook | date=2006-07-30 | publisher= | url =http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5592610 | work =NPR | pages = | accessdate = 2009-09-06 | language = }}</ref>

Etheridge agreed to write ''An Inconvenient Truth'''s theme song, "[[I Need to Wake Up]]" after viewing Gore's slide show.<ref name='melissaetheridgelatimes'>{{cite news

"I was so honored he would ask me to contribute to a project that is so powerful and so important, I felt such a huge responsibility," she said. "Then I went, 'What am I going to write? What am I going to say?' " Etheridge's partner, [[Tammy Lynn Michaels]], told her: "Write what you feel, because that's what people are going to feel."<ref name='melissaetheridgelatimes'>{{cite news

She found the words: "I need to move, I need to wake up, I need to change, I need to shake up..."

On tour, Etheridge has urged her audiences to see the film and to act.

Etheridge's commitment to the project touched Gore. "Melissa is a rare soul who gives a lot of time and effort to causes in which she strongly believes," he said.<ref name='melissaetheridgelatimes'>{{cite news | first=Tina | last=Daunt | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=She's Speaking Out Through Her Songs | date=2006-08-09 | publisher= | url =http://articles.latimes.com/2006/aug/09/entertainment/et-etheridge9?pg=1 | work =Los Angeles Times | pages = | accessdate = 2009-09-06 | language = }}</ref>

Etheridge received the [[2006]] [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for "I Need to Wake Up." Upon receiving the award, she noted in her acceptance speech:

The film received a generally positive reaction from film critics. It garnered a "certified fresh" 93% rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] (as of May 21, 2007), with a 94% rating from the "Cream of the Crop" reviewers. At ''[[Metacritic]]'', which assigns a [[normalization (statistics)|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 75, based on 32 reviews.<ref name="meta">{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/inconvenienttruth | title=An Inconvenient Truth: Reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=CNET Networks, Inc | accessdate=2008-12-09 }}</ref> Film critics [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Richard Roeper]] gave the film "two thumbs up".  Ebert said, "In 39 years, I have never written these words in a movie review, but here they are: You owe it to yourself to see this film. If you do not, and you have grandchildren, you should explain to them why you decided not to,"<ref>[[Roger Ebert]] [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060601/REVIEWS/60517002 ''An Inconvenient Truth''] ''Chicago Sunday Times'', retrieved 2007-01-10</ref> calling the film "horrifying, enthralling and [having] the potential, I believe, to actually change public policy and begin a process which could save the Earth."<ref name="goreplaysleadingman"/> 

''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' critic [[David Edelstein]] called the film, "One of the most realistic documentaries I've ever seen&mdash;and, dry as it is, one of the most devastating in its implications."<ref>[[David Edelstein]] [http://nymag.com/movies/listings/rv_52847.htm ''An Inconvenient Truth''] ''New York Magazine'', retrieved 2008-12-09</ref> ''[[The New Yorker]]'''s [[David Remnick]] added that while it was "not the most entertaining film of the year...it might be the most important" and a "brilliantly lucid, often riveting attempt to warn Americans off our hellbent path to global suicide."<ref>[[David Remnick]] [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/04/24/060424ta_talk_remnick ''Ozone Man''] ''New Yorker'', retrieved 2009-02-25</ref> ''[[New York Times]]'' reviewer [[A.O. Scott]] thought the film was "edited crisply enough to keep it from feeling like 90 minutes of [[C-SPAN]] and shaped to give Mr. Gore's argument a real sense of drama," and "as unsettling as it can be," Scott continued, "it is also intellectually exhilarating, and, like any good piece of pedagogy, whets the appetite for further study."<ref>[[A.O.

He will be attacked, but the public will have the information needed to distinguish our long-term well-being from short-term special interests."<ref>{{cite news | first=James | last=Hansen | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=The Threat to the Planet | date=2006-07-13 | publisher= | url =http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19131 | work =New York Review of Books | pages = | accessdate = 2009-08-22 | language = }}</ref>

On the other hand, several reviews criticized the film on scientific and political grounds. Journalist [[Ronald Bailey]] argued in the [[libertarian]] magazine ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' that although "Gore gets [the science] more right than wrong," he exaggerates the risks.<ref>Ronald Bailey [http://www.reason.com/rb/rb061606.shtml Gore as climate exaggerator] ''Reason'', dated 2006-06-16, retrieved 2007-01-10</ref>[[List of scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming|Global warming skeptics]] were vocally critical of the film, such as [[MIT]] physicist [[Richard Lindzen|Richard S. Lindzen]], who wrote in a June 26, 2006 op-ed in the ''Wall Street Journal'' that Gore was using a biased presentation to exploit the fears of the public for his own political gain.<ref>Richard S. Lindzen [http://epw.senate.gov/fact.cfm?party=rep&id=257863 There Is No 'Consensus' On Global Warming] ''Wall Street Journal'', retrieved 2007-01-10</ref> Some reviewers were also skeptical of Gore's intent, wondering whether he was setting himself for another Presidential run. ''[[Boston Globe]]'' writer Peter Canello criticized the "gauzy biographical material that seems to have been culled from old Gore campaign commercials."<ref>Peter Canello, [http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/06/06/gores_ecology_film_gets_an_inconvenient_label_of_liberalism/ ''Gore's ecology film gets an `inconvenient' label of liberalism''] ''Boston Globe'', retrieved 2009-02-25</ref> [[Phil Hall (US writer)|Phil Hall]] of ''[[Film Threat]]'' gave the film a negative review, saying "''An Inconvenient Truth'' is something you rarely see in movies today: a blatant intellectual fraud."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=reviews&Id=8451 |title=An Inconvenient Truth |last=Hall |first=Phil |date=May 15, 2006 |work=[[Film Threat]] |accessdate=February 28, 2009}}</ref>

===Public opinion===
In a July 2007 47-country Internet survey conducted by [[The Nielsen Company]] and [[Oxford University]], sixty-six percent of viewers who claimed to have seen ''An Inconvenient Truth'' said the film had
<U+201C>changed their mind<U+201D> about global warming and eighty-nine percent said watching the movie made
them more aware of the problem. Three out of four (74%) viewers said they changed some of their habits as a result of seeing the film.<ref name="global survey"/>

=== Governmental ===
====United States====
Then-president George W. Bush, when asked whether he would watch the film, responded: "Doubt it." He later stated that "And in my judgment we need to set aside whether or not greenhouse gases have been caused by mankind or because of natural effects, and focus on the [[Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate|technologies]] that will enable us to live better lives and at the same time protect the environment." Gore responded that "The entire global scientific community has a consensus on the question that human beings are responsible for global warming and he [Bush] has today again expressed personal doubt that that is true." White House deputy press secretary [[Dana Perino]] stated that <U+201C>The president noted in 2001 the increase in temperatures over the past 100 years and that the increase in greenhouse gases was due to certain extent to human activity<U+201D>.<ref name=APBush>{{cite web | title=Bush gives thumbs down to Gore's new movie | date=2006-05-24 | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12930351/ | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref>

====International====
In September 2006, Gore traveled to [[Sydney, Australia]] to promote the film. Then-Australian Prime Minister [[John Howard]] said he would not meet with Gore or agree to [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto]] because of the movie: "I don't take policy advice from films."

== Controversy ==
===In the United Kingdom===
==== The Dimmock case ====
{{further|[[Dimmock v Secretary of State for Education and Skills]]}}

As part of a nationwide "Sustainable Schools Year of Action" launched in late 2006, the [[UK Government]], [[Welsh Assembly Government]] and [[Scottish Executive]] announced between January-March 2007 that copies of ''An Inconvenient Truth'' would be sent to all [[secondary school]]s in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]]. The UK Government's distribution of the film was challenged in May 2007 in the [[High Court of Justice]] by a group of global warming skeptics led by Stewart Dimmock, a [[lorry]] (HGV) driver and school governor from [[Kent]], [[England]], a father of two sons who attend a [[state school]]. Dimmock has twice stood as a local election candidate<ref>[http://newparty.co.uk/news/may2007/encouraging-results-for-new-party-candidates.html "News from the New Party"], May 5, 2007, New Party website</ref> for the [[The New Party (UK)|New Party]] and received backing for the case from [[Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley|Viscount Monckton]], the author of the New Party's manifesto.<ref name=Leake>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/education/article2652851.ece "Please, sir - Gore's got warming wrong"], Jonathan Leake, Environment Editor, ''[[Sunday Times]]'', October 14, 2007</ref> The plaintiffs sought an [[injunction]] preventing the screening of the film in English schools. They argued that schools are legally forbidden to promote partisan political views in the teaching of any subject in school and, when dealing with political issues, are required to provide a balanced presentation of opposing views.

On 10 October 2007, Mr Justice Burton, after explaining that the requirement for a balanced presentation does not warrant that equal weight be given to alternative views of a mainstream view, ruled that it was clear that the film was substantially founded upon scientific research and fact, albeit that the science is used, in the hands of a talented politician and communicator, to make a political statement and to support a political program.<ref name="dimmock">{{cite web

}}</ref> The film could then, on that basis, be shown, provided an accompanying explanation was given of its scientific errors, in order to prevent political indoctrination.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2007/10/11/scigore111.xml Al Gore's 'nine Inconvenient Untruths'] - Telegraph. Date 2007-10-11</ref>

The judge concluded "I have no doubt that Dr Stott, the Defendant's expert, is right when he says that: 'Al Gore's presentation of the causes and likely effects of climate change in the film was broadly accurate.'" On the basis of testimony from [[Robert M. Carter]] and the arguments put forth by the claimant's lawyers, the judge also pointed to [[Dimmock v Secretary of State for Education and Skills#The nine inaccuracies|nine errors]], i.e. statements that he found to depart from the [[scientific consensus on global warming|mainstream]]. He also found that some of these errors arose in the context of alarmism and exaggeration in support of Al Gore's political thesis. Since the government had already accepted to amend the guidance notes to address these errors along with other points in a fashion that the judge found satisfactory, no order was made on the application.

The Minister of Children, Young People and Families, [[Kevin Brennan (politician)|Kevin Brennan]], declared the outcome a victory for the government, stating: "We have updated the accompanying guidance, as requested by the judge to make it clearer for teachers as to the stated Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change position on a number of scientific points raised in the film.<ref>{{cite web

=== In the United States ===
In the United States, 50,000 free copies of ''An Inconvenient Truth'' were offered to the [[National Science Teachers Association]] (NSTA), which declined to take them. Producer David, provided an email correspondence from the NSTA detailing that their reasoning was that the DVDs would place "unnecessary risk upon the [NSTA] capital campaign, especially certain targeted supporters," and that they saw "little, if any, benefit to NSTA or its members" in accepting the free DVDs.<ref>

In public, the NSTA argued that distributing this film to its members would have been contrary to a long-standing NSTA policy against distributing unsolicited materials to its members.  The NSTA also said that they had offered several other options for distributing the film but ultimately "[it] appears that these alternative distribution mechanisms were unsatisfactory."<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref>  David has said that NSTA Executive Director Gerry Wheeler promised in a telephone conversation to explore alternatives with NSTA's board for advertising the film but she had not yet received an alternative offer at the time of NSTA's public claim. She also said that she rejected their subsequent offers because they were nothing more than offers to sell their "commercially available member mailing list" and advertising space in their magazine and newsletter, which are available to anyone.  She noted that in the past, NSTA had shipped out 20,000 copies of a 10-part video produced by Wheeler with funding provided by ConocoPhillips in 2003.  NSTA indicated that they retained editorial control over the content, which David questioned based on the point of view portrayed in the global warming section of the video.<ref>
