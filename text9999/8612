The '''Green Shrike-babbler''' (''Pteruthius xanthochlorus'') is a [[bird]] [[species]] traditionally considered an aberrant [[Old World babbler]] and placed in the [[family (biology)|family]] Timaliidae. But as it seems, it belongs to an [[Asia]]n offshoot of the [[United States|America]]n [[vireo]]s and may well belong in the Vireonidae. Indeed, since long it was noted that their habits resemble those of vireos, but this was believed to be the result of [[convergent evolution]].

It is found in [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Vietnam]]. Its natural [[habitat]] is subtropical or tropical moist [[montane forest]]s.
