'''Diptendu Pramanick''' (July 1910 <U+2013> Dec 1989) ({{lang-bn|<U+09A6><U+09C0><U+09AA><U+09CD><U+09A4><U+09C7><U+09A8><U+09CD><U+09A6><U+09C1> <U+09AA><U+09CD><U+09B0><U+09BE><U+09AE><U+09BE><U+09A3><U+09BF><U+0995>}}) was a [[Bengali people|bengali]] film personality from [[Calcutta]]. He was the founder secretary of the ''Eastern India Motion Pictures Association'' <ref>[http://eimpacinema.blogspot.com/2009/08/association-of-film-industry-of-eastern.html EIMPA blog]</ref> in Calcutta, [[India]] - a fraternity of film personnel which is an interface between the entertainment industry of eastern India and the Government. During his multifarious career he came in contact with eminent personalities and saw the evolution of this organization from its initial days to being a regionwide entity.

==Early life and education==
He was born on [[July 18]], 1910 in Calcutta. He was the eldest son of [[Sudhamoy Pramanick]] from [[Shantipur]]. He did his early schooling in Calcutta and then at the Raiganj Coronation School, [[Raiganj]] where his father practised as a lawyer.

In 1926 he returned to Calcutta and cleared Matriculation followed by the Intermediate examinations in Science in 1928. He then joined the [[Scottish Church College, Calcutta]].

His interactions with many a revolutionary (due to his father's involvement with the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] and the [[Salt Satyagraha|Satyagraha]] movement at Raigunj), the explosive air of the times, and the inspiration from a famous alumni ''(The [[Presidency University, Kolkata#Presidency during the Indian freedom struggle|Oaten Affair]])'' <ref>[http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/politics/subhas-boses-statue-unveiled-at-presidency-college_100345774.html Subhas Chandra Bose assaults Oaten, 1916]</ref> probably drove him to antagonize an Indian-loathing teacher at Scottish Church College, and follow [[Subhas Chandra Bose|Bose's]] suit.

He later graduated from [[Asutosh College, Calcutta|Asutosh College]], and earned a bachelor's degree in science from the [[University of Calcutta]] in 1931.

In his autobiography he wrote {{cquote|.. Was deluged with garlands ... Bengali people are quite different from the rest of India. They are like the Irish, emotional, sentimental.
