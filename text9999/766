In a 2004 interview with the ''[[Sunday Times#Irish_edition|Sunday Times]]'' (Irish edition), she said of the experience, "I did it for a laugh...it was offered me because I was quite well known, and because I spoke French and Irish with some ease...I always tell people that there was no autocue in those days: I had to learn it all off."<ref name="sundaytimes"/>

N<U+00ED> Bhriain provided the RT<U+00C9> Radio commentary for the [[Eurovision 1991|1991 Contest]].
