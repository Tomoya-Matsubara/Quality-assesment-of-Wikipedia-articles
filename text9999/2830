Teng was known for her [[folk song]]s and romantic [[ballad]]s. Many became standards in her lifetime, such as "[[When Will You Return?]]" and "[[The Moon Represents My Heart]]".<ref name=nyt-obit>Wudunn, Sheryl.

Teng, a lifelong sufferer from [[asthma]], died in 1995 from a severe respiratory attack while on holiday in Thailand. She was 42.

==Early life==
Teresa Teng was born in Tianyang Village (<U+7530><U+6D0B><U+6751>), [[Baozhong, Yunlin|Baozhong Township]], [[Yunlin County]], [[Taiwan]] on 29 January 1953, to [[waishengren|mainland Chinese]] parents. Her father was a soldier in the [[Republic of China Armed Forces]] from [[Daming County|Daming]], [[Hebei]] and her mother was from [[Dongping County|Dongping]], [[Shandong]]. She was the only girl, with three older brothers and a younger brother. She was educated at Ginling Girls High School (<U+79C1><U+7ACB><U+91D1><U+9675><U+5973><U+4E2D>) in [[Sanchong District|Sanchong Township]], [[New Taipei City|Taipei County]].

As a young child, Teng won awards for her singing at talent competitions. Her first major prize was in 1964 when she sang "Visiting Yingtai" from [[Shaw Brothers]]' [[Huangmei opera]] movie, "[[The Love Eterne]]" (<U+6881><U+795D>), at an event hosted by [[Broadcasting Corporation of China]]. She was soon able to support her family with her singing. Taiwan's rising manufacturing economy in the 1960s made the purchase of records easier for more families. With her father's approval, she quit high school to pursue singing professionally.

==Career==
Teng's singing style conveyed simplicity and sincerity. Yeh Yueh-Yu, a professor of Cultural Theory at the [[University of Southern California]] said, "It was the sweetness in her voice that made her famous. She had a perfect voice for folk songs and ballads, and she added traditional folk song stylings into Western-style compositions." Her voice was also described as being "like weeping and pleading, but with strength, capable of drawing in and hypnotizing listeners." Songwriter Tsuo Hung-yun said Teng's voice was "seven parts sweetness, three parts tears."

Teng gained her first taste of fame in 1968 when a performance on a popular Taiwanese music program led to a record contract. She released several albums within the next few years under the [[Life Records]] label. In 1973 she attempted to crack the Japanese market by signing with the [[Polydor]] Japan label and taking part in Japan's [[K<U+014D>haku Uta Gassen]], a year-round singing match of the most successful artists. She was named "Best New Singing Star".<ref>{{cite news|title = Pop diva Teresa Teng lives on in Chinese hearts|publisher = China Daily |date = 2005-05-12 | accessdate = 2007-03-23 | url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-05/12/content_441430.htm }}</ref> Following her success in Japan, Teng recorded several Japanese songs, including original hits such as {{nihongo|"Give yourself to the flow of Time"|<U+6642><U+306E><U+6D41><U+308C><U+306B><U+8EAB><U+3092><U+307E><U+304B><U+305B>|Toki no Nagare ni Mi wo Makase}} which was later covered in Mandarin as "[[I Only Care About You]]".

In 1974 the song "Airport" ({{lang|zh|<U+7A7A><U+6E2F>}}) became a hit in Japan. Teng's popularity in Japan continued despite being briefly barred from the country in 1979 for having a fake Indonesian passport she purchased for US$20,000. The subterfuge had seemed necessary due to the official break in [[Republic of China <U+2013> Japan relations|relations between Taiwan and Japan]] that occurred shortly after the [[People's Republic of China]] replaced the ROC in the [[China and the United Nations|United Nations]].

Teng's popularity boomed in the 1970s after her success in Japan. Singing by now in Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese and English, Teng's influence spread to Malaysia and Indonesia. In Taiwan she was known not only as the island's most popular export, but as "the soldier's sweetheart" because of her frequent performances for servicemen. Teng was herself the child of a military family. Her concerts for troops featured Taiwanese folk songs that appealed to [[Taiwanese people|natives of the island]] as well as Chinese folk songs that appealed to homesick refugees of the [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]].

In the early 1980s, continuing political tension between China and Taiwan led to her music, along with that of other singers from Taiwan and Hong Kong, being banned for several years in China as too "bourgeois".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DD153CF93AA25751C0A967958260 | work=The New York Times | title=A Taiwan Pop Singer Sways the Mainland | first=Nicholas D. | last=Kristof | date=February 19, 1991 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}</ref> Her popularity in China continued to grow nonetheless thanks to the black market. As Teng songs continued to be played everywhere, from nightclubs to government buildings, the ban on her music was soon lifted. Her fans nicknamed her "Little Deng" because she had the same family name as [[Deng Xiaoping]]; there was a saying that "Deng the Communist leader ruled by day, but Deng the singer ruled by night.<ref>Zhou, Kate (2011). ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=CvzebFwWRAcC&printsec=frontcover China's Long March to Freedom: Grassroots Modernization]''. Transaction Publishers. p. 145.</ref>

Teng's contract with Polydor ended in 1981. She signed a contract with Taurus Records in 1983 and made a successful comeback appearance in Japan. In 1983 Taurus released her album, ''[[Dandan youqing]]''. This album consisted of settings of 12 poems from the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] dynasties. The music, written by composers of her earlier hits, blended modern and traditional styles of East and West. The most popular single from the album today is "[[Wishing We Last Forever]]". The number of hits released in the years from 1984<U+2013>1989 make them "Teresa Teng's Golden Years" to many of her fans. During this time, she won the All-Japan Record Awards for four consecutive years (1984<U+2013>1988). Teresa Teng was also named one of the top female singers in the world by ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine.<ref>Yeh, Joseph. [http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Showbiz/Story/A1Story20130126-398041.html "Legendary singer Teresa Teng's exhibition kicks off today"]. news.asiaone.com. January 26, 2013. Retrieved March 11, 2013.</ref>  However, there is no article in the TIME Magazine website so the reliability of such report is questionable.

Gunther Mende, Mary Susan Applegate and Candy de Rouge wrote a song entitled {{Citation | title = [[The Power of Love (Jennifer Rush song)|The Power of Love]]}} for Jennifer Rush.  Teresa Teng covered it and made it notable in Asian regions.  She originally sang it in her {{Citation | title = Last Concert | year = 1985}} in Tokyo - 8 years before being sung and released by [[Celine Dion]].

Teng performed in Paris during the 1989 [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen student protests]] on behalf of the students and expressed her support. On May 27, 1989, over 300,000 people attended the concert called "Democratic songs dedicated to China" ({{lang|zh-hant|<U+6C11><U+4E3B><U+6B4C><U+8072><U+737B><U+4E2D><U+83EF>}}) at the [[Happy Valley Racecourse]] in Hong Kong. One of the highlights was her rendition of "My Home Is on the Other Side of the Mountain."<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P49M1VJlt74 | type = video | title = YouTube | publisher = Google}}.{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>

Though Teng performed in many countries around the world, she never performed in China. The [[Communist Party of China]] eventually invited her to do so in the 1990s, but she died before having the opportunity.<ref>{{cite news|title = Why Teresa Teng Could Not Visit Mainland China|publisher = Southern Weekend (via Sina.com) |last = Zhao |first = Lei| date = August 3, 2006 | accessdate = 2007-03-23 | url = http://www.zonaeuropa.com/culture/c20060805_1.htm}}</ref>

==Death and commemorations==
[[File:The Home of Teresa Teng china.jpg|thumb|Teresa Teng's Hong Kong House]]
Teng died from a severe [[asthma]] attack, though doctors and her partner Paul Quilery had speculated that she died from a heart attack due to a side effect of an overdose of  [[adrenergic agonists]] while on holiday in [[Chiang Mai]], [[Thailand]], at the age of 42 (43 by [[East Asian age reckoning]]) on May 8, 1995.<ref name=":2" /> Quilery was buying groceries when the attack occurred.<ref name=":2" />  He was also aware that Teresa relied on the same medication in the two months before her death with minor attacks.<ref name=":2" />  Teresa was an asthmatic throughout her adult life. Teng was given [[state funeral|state honors]] at her funeral in Taiwan. President [[Lee Teng-hui]] was in attendance among thousands.

Teresa Teng was buried in a mountainside tomb at [[Chin Pao San]], a cemetery in [[Jinshan District, New Taipei|Jinshan]], [[New Taipei City]] (then Taipei County) overlooking the north coast of Taiwan. The grave site features a statue of Teng and a large electronic piano keyboard set in the ground that can be played by visitors who step on the keys. The memorial is often visited by her fans <U+2014> this represents a noteworthy departure from the traditional Chinese practice of shunning grave sites.<ref>[http://www.northguan-nsa.gov.tw/en/view_detail.php?id=13 Teresa Teng's grave].

A house she bought in 1986 in [[Hong Kong]] at No. 18 Carmel Street, [[Stanley, Hong Kong|Stanley]] also became a popular fan site soon after her death. Plans to sell the home to finance a museum in [[Shanghai]] were made known in 2002,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2159548.stm Taiwanese diva's home 'for sale']. BBC news, 29 July 2002. Retrieved 2 Jan 2007.</ref> and subsequently sold for [[HK$]] 32 million. It closed on what would have been her 51st birthday on January 29, 2004.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080227001327/http://www.hkvpradio.com/newsletters/2004december.html A Retrospective Look at 2004].

To commemorate the 10th anniversary of her death, the Teresa Teng Culture and Education Foundation launched a campaign entitled "Feel Teresa Teng". In addition to organizing an anniversary concert in Hong Kong and Taiwan, fans paid homage at her shrine at Chin Pao San Cemetery. Additionally, some of her dresses, jewelry and personal items were placed on exhibition at [http://www.yuzile.com Yuzi Paradise], an art park outside [[Guilin]], China.<ref>{{cite news|title = Teresa Teng in loving memory forever |publisher = China Daily |date = 2005-05-08 | accessdate = 2007-03-23 | url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-05/08/content_440103.htm }}</ref> The foundation also served as her wishes to set up a school or educational institute.<ref name=":2" />

In May 2002, a wax figure of Teng was unveiled at [[Madame Tussauds Hong Kong]].

==Personal life==
Teresa had guarded her personal life from the public since 1987, fearing that it would jeopardize her career.  She had a failed relationship with the son of a Malaysian gambling industry tycoon, that ended with his death when she was about 19.  In 1982, she was engaged to Beau Kuok [[:zh:<U+90ED><U+5B54><U+4E1E>|<U+90ED><U+5B54><U+4E1E>]], a Malaysian businessman/CEO/Chairman (at the time with [[Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts]]) and son of multi-billionaire [[Robert Kuok]]. They met in 1978, but Teng called off the engagement due to prenuptial agreements which said that Teng has to quit and sever all ties with the entertainment industry, as well as fully disclose her biography and her rumoured relationships in writing.<ref>[http://baike.baidu.com/view/1407686.htm Beau Kuok in Baidu]</ref> She also had a high-profile rumored relationship with Jackie Chan, which resulted in failed farewell performances on [[EYT|Enjoy Yourselves Tonight]] in her attempts to fade out of entertainment business.  In 1989, she met a French photographer Quilery Paul Puel Stephane (Paul) in Paris. They spent 7 years together until her death.  Paul revealed at an interview with [[Karen Mok]] 3 years after her death that they were engaged in a temple in [[Chang Mai]], Thailand in 1995, and planned to marry in August.<ref name=":2">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5XSZ3QSti4 Teresa Teng those years before she passing away <U+9127><U+9E97><U+541B> <U+9093><U+4E3D><U+541B> <U+6700><U+5F8C><U+7684><U+79D8><U+5BC6><U+751F><U+6D3B>2</ref><ref name=":0">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlXCYWkw7qk Teresa Teng those years before she passing away <U+9127><U+9E97><U+541B> <U+9093><U+4E3D><U+541B> <U+6700><U+5F8C><U+7684><U+79D8><U+5BC6><U+751F><U+6D3B>1 ]</ref>
