This is a '''list of first-round draft picks made by the [[Carolina Panthers]]''' of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). 
This list concerns the first round of the [[NFL Draft|"NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting"]], which occurs every April, and is more commonly known as the ''NFL Draft''.  The Panthers joined the NFL in [[1995 NFL season|1995]] as the league's 29th franchise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.panthers.com/Team/Default.aspx?id=758|title=History|accessdate=2007-05-28|publisher=Panthers.com}}</ref> Their first ever selection was [[Kerry Collins]], a [[quarterback]] from [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]], in the [[1995 NFL Draft]]. The team's most-recent first-round selection was [[Jon Beason]], a [[linebacker]] from the [[University of Miami]], in the [[2007 NFL Draft]].  The Panthers have never had the first overall selection; their highest draft position was second overall in [[2002 NFL Draft|2002]] when they selected [[Julius Peppers]], a [[defensive end]] from [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina]].  The Panthers have twice selected a [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami Hurricanes]] player in the first round: linebacker [[Dan Morgan]] in [[2001 NFL Draft|2001]] and Beason in 2007.

Collins, the team's first ever selection, made the [[Pro Bowl]] and led the Panthers to the playoffs in only their second season of existence, but he was later released after struggling on and off the field with [[alcoholism]].  [[Rae Carruth]] began his career as a promising wide receiver,<ref>"He played a remarkable rookie season...", "He was "a fast receiver who could catch and had big-play potential," said Hurney."{{Cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/carruth/121400_ctv.html|title=Panther back office testifies for Carruth|accessdate=2007-06-01|publisher=CourtTV.com|year=2000-12-14}}</ref> but he was dropped from the team after being arrested for killing his pregnant girlfriend.  On more positive notes, Julius Peppers won [[NFL Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]], has been named to the Pro Bowl on several occasions, and is the centerpiece of the Panthers' defensive line.<ref>"On a defensive line that suddenly has emerged as one of the league's best young units... Peppers is the linchpin."{{Cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/trainingcamp03/columns/pasquarelli_len/1596555.html|title=Peppers has bulked up, improved footwork|accessdate=2007-05-29|publisher=ESPN.com|year=2003-08-05|author=Len Pasquarelli}}</ref>  Dan Morgan is also a highly touted Pro Bowl linebacker, but repeated [[concussion]]s have caused him to miss parts of several seasons.  The Panthers drafted Jon Beason in 2007 partially to insure their defense against Morgan's absence.<ref>"Beason gives the Panthers the comfort they need at linebacker, where they can't help but be nervous about Dan Morgan's repeated problems with concussions."{{Cite web|url=http://www.panthers.com/Common/Article.aspx?id=18414|title=What they're saying|accessdate=2007-05-29|publisher=Panthers.com}}</ref>

When the Panthers and [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] joined the league together in 1995, both teams participated in an [[expansion draft]], where they selected players from 30 existing NFL teams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.panthers.com/Team/Default.aspx?id=806|title=Expansion Draft|accessdate=2007-05-28|publisher=Panthers.com}}</ref>  This list does not include players selected in that draft.
