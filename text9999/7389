Sehwag is an aggressive right-handed opening batsman and a part-time right-arm off-spin bowler. He played his first [[One Day International]] in 1999 and joined the Indian [[Test cricket]] team in 2001. In April 2009, Sehwag became the only Indian to be honoured as the [[Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World]] for his performance in 2008,<ref>{{cite web|author=TNN, 9 April 2009, 12:16&nbsp;am IST |url=http://cricket.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/4377189.cms |title=Sehwag is world's top cricketer for 2008 |publisher=Cricket.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=9 April 2009 |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> subsequently becoming the first player of any nationality to retain the award for 2009.<ref name=WisdenLC>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisden.com/default.aspx?id=2|title=Wisden Leading Cricketer In The World|accessdate=14 April 2010|publisher=Wisden}}</ref>

Sehwag created history when he crossed the 200 run mark in ODI's on 8th December, 2011 at  Indore. He scored 219 off 149 balls against the West Indies during the 4th ODI of the 5 match series, with a strike rate of 146.97. His score of 219 is the highest score in ODI's. In typical Sehwag fashion, he reached the 200 run mark with a 4. Sehwag has formed a habit of reaching milestones with boundaries.   	

Sehwag holds multiple records including the highest score made by an Indian in Test cricket (319), which was also the fastest triple [[century (cricket)|century]] in the history of international cricket (reached 300 off only 278 balls) as well as the fastest 250 by any batsman (in 207 balls against Sri Lanka on 3 December 2009 at the [[Brabourne Stadium]] in Mumbai). His other innings of 309 and 293 are also the second and third best by any Indian player. Sehwag also holds the distinction of being one of four batsmen in the world to have ever surpassed 300 twice in Test cricket, and the only one to score two triple centuries and take a five-wicket [[innings]] haul.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.cricinfo.com/india/content/current/player/35263.html |title=Player profile Cricinfo |publisher=Content.cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> In March 2009, Sehwag smashed the fastest century ever scored by an Indian in ODI cricket, from 60 balls.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mathrubhumi.org/news.php?id=13501&cat=1&sub=17&subit=0 |title= PTI: Sehwag becomes fastest Indian centurion in ODIs |date=11 March 2009|work=Mathrubhumi  |accessdate=12 February 2010 }}</ref> On 8 December 2011, he hit his maiden double century in ODI cricket, against [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]], becoming the second batsman after [[Sachin Tendulkar]] to reach the landmark.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ind vs WI: Sehwag slams 112-ball 150 as India eye massive total|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/series-tournaments/west-indies-in-india/top-stories/Ind-vs-WI-Sehwag-slams-112-ball-150-as-India-eye-massive-total/articleshow/11031022.cms|accessdate=8 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=8 December 2011}}</ref> He holds the current record for the highest individual score of 219 off just 149 balls in ODIs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Virender Sehwag slams maiden double century in ODIs, scripts history|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/series-tournaments/west-indies-in-india/top-stories/Virender-Sehwag-slams-maiden-double-century-in-ODIs-scripts-history/articleshow/11033211.cms|accessdate=8 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=8 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Virender Sehwag becomes 2nd batsman to slam 200 in ODIs|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/wi-ind-2011/news/item/182104-4th-odi-sehwag-becomes-2nd-batsman-to-slam-200-in-odis?pfrom=home-lateststories|accessdate=8 December 2011|newspaper=[[NDTV]]|date=8 December 2011}}</ref>

Sehwag was appointed as vice-captain of the Indian team under [[Rahul Dravid]] in October 2005 but due to poor form, he was later replaced by [[V. V. S. Laxman]] in December 2006 as Test vice-captain. In January 2007, Sehwag was dropped from the ODI team and later from the Test team as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/indvwi/content/story/276198.html |title=Cricinfo <U+2013> Sehwag out, Ganguly picked for ODIs |publisher=Content-usa.cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> During his term as vice-captain, Sehwag skippered the team in place of injured Dravid in 2 ODIs and 1 Test. Following his return to form in 2008 and the retirement of [[Anil Kumble]], Sehwag has been reappointed as the vice-captain for both Tests and ODIs. By early 2009, Sehwag had reestablished himself as one of the best performing batsmen in ODI cricket.<ref>{{cite web|author=Cricketnext.com |url=http://cricketnext.in.com/news/top-performer-virender-sehwag/38979-25.html |title=Cricketnext: Top Performer: Virender Sehwag |publisher=Cricketnext.in.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref>

==Early years==
Sehwag was born in a [[Jat]] family from [[Haryana]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040416/edit.htm#8|publisher=''[http://www.tribuneindia.com/ The Tribune]''|title=Verma<U+2019>s gift for Sehwag|author=Tribune News Service

Though now settled in New Delhi, the Sehwag family hails from Haryana. Sehwag was the third of four children born to father Krishan and mother Krishna Sehwag, with two older sisters Manju and Anju, and younger brother Vinod. His father attributes his interest in cricket to a toy bat which he was given when he was seven months old. He attended Arora Vidya School in Delhi, and pestered his parents to let him play cricket, on the basis that he was not academically gifted.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://clients.rediff.com/philipseyefi/Virender.htm |title=rediff.com World Cup 2003: An encounter with Virender Sehwag's family |publisher=Clients.rediff.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}{{dead link|date=September 2011}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> His father tried to end his career when he broke a tooth as a child in 1990, but Sehwag evaded the ban with the help of his mother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040403/windows/main1.htm |title=Super Sehwag |work=The Tribune |location=India |date=3 April 2004 |accessdate=12 February 2010 }}</ref> Later he attended [[Jamia Milia Islamia]] for graduation.

==Cricketing career==
===Early domestic cricket===
Sehwag made his debut for [[Delhi cricket team]] in first class cricket in the 1997<U+2013>98 season. He was selected to the [[North Zone cricket team]] for the [[Duleep Trophy]] the following 1998<U+2013>99 season, ending fifth in the total runscoring list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1998-99/IND_LOCAL/DULEEP/STATS/IND_LOCAL_DULEEP_AVS_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html |title=Batting <U+2013> Most Runs |publisher=.cricinfo.com |date=17 June 2008 |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> The following year he was fourth on the Duleep Trophy run scoring list, including a 274, the highest score of the competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1999-2000/IND_LOCAL/DULEEP/STATS/IND_LOCAL_DULEEP_AVS_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html |title=Batting <U+2013> Most Runs |publisher=.cricinfo.com |date=17 June 2008 |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> This was attained against [[South Zone cricket team|South Zone]] at [[Agartala]] in just 327 balls, and followed a rapid 187 from just 175 in a Ranji Trophy match against [[Punjab cricket team|Punjab]].<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/95850.html |first=Anand |last=Vasu |title=Cricinfo <U+2013> Give Sehwag the freedom to run riot |publisher=Content-aus.cricinfo.com |date=3 August 2001 |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> He was then selected for the U-19 team which toured South Africa.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> He was seventh in the 2000<U+2013>01 season with two centuries,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2000-01/IND_LOCAL/DULEEP/STATS/IND_LOCAL_DULEEP_AVS_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html |title=Batting <U+2013> Most Runs |publisher=cricinfo.com |date=17 June 2008 |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> but his consistency earned the attention of selectors and he became a regular member of the national team in mid 2001.

Since his international career started, he has continued to play for Delhi in the domestic competition whilst he is not occupied with international duty and has captained North Zone to victory in the [[Deodhar Trophy]] in 2004<U+2013>05 and 2005<U+2013>-06.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.cricinfo.com/db/NATIONAL/IND/DEODHAR_WINNERS.html |title=India <U+2013> Deodhar Trophy Winners |publisher=Cricinfo |date=17 June 2008 |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> He also had a short stint with [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]] in county cricket in 2003, but a back injury lead to a mutual termination of the contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/129053.html |title=Cricinfo <U+2013> Leicestershire and Sehwag part company |publisher=Content-aus.cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref>

=== ODI career ===
Sehwag's [[One Day International|ODI]] career started poorly when he scored 1 against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] in [[Mohali]] in April 1999 when he fell lbw to [[Shoaib Akhtar]]. His bowling performance was also ineffective and expensive, conceding 35 runs off 3 overs. He did not get another chance in the national team for 20 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1998-99/OD_TOURNEYS/PC-IND/SCORECARDS/IND_PAK_PC-IND_ODI6_01APR1999.html |title=6th ODI: India v Pakistan at Mohali, 1 Apr 1999 |publisher=Cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref>
[[Image:Indiancricketers.jpg|thumb|upright|Sehwag with teammates [[Harbhajan Singh]] (Left) and [[Yuvraj Singh]] (Middle).]]
Sehwag was not given another match until the home series against [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]]{{ref|ODIALL}} in December 2000. Sehwag rose to prominence in his fourth ODI match in March 2001 when he scored 58 off 54 balls, against [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] in [[Bangalore]]. Combined with his three wickets, he help earn India a victory and was awarded his first man of the match award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2000-01/AUS_IN_IND/SCORECARDS/AUS_IND_ODI1_25MAR2001.html |title=1st ODI: India v Australia at Bangalore, 25 Mar 2001 |publisher=Cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> He followed this with an unproductive tour of Zimbabwe in mid 2001.

Sehwag had his international breakthrough in [[Sri Lanka]] in August 2001 when he was promoted to the opening slot for the tri-series also involving New Zealand. The promotion to open the innings came because regular opener [[Sachin Tendulkar]] was absent due to a foot injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/101381.html |title=Cricinfo <U+2013> Injured Tendulkar ruled out for Sri Lanka tri-series |publisher=Content-usa.cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> In the match against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] that was to decide the finalist, he scored his maiden century from 69 balls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2001/OD_TOURNEYS/CCC-SL/SCORECARDS/IND_NZ_CCC-SL_ODI9_02AUG2001.html |title=9th Match: India v New Zealand at Colombo, 2 Aug 2001 |publisher=Cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> At the time, the century was the third fastest ODI century for an Indian behind [[Mohammad Azharuddin]]'s 62 ball effort and Yuvraj singh's 64 ball effort. This was his first score beyond 50 in ten matches and saw him named man of the match. This performance earned him a regular spot in the ODI squad in the middle-order. He bettered his own record by hitting a 60-ball century against New Zealand during the 2009 tour. An innings of note in 2002 was the 22 ball half-century against [[Kenyan cricket team|Kenya]] in [[Goodyear Park|Bloemfontein]], tying the second fastest 50 by an Indian. Because of his attacking cricket stroke plays, Sehwag has got many fans, including the WestIndies legend Desmond Haynes, who admitted that he is a great fan of him.<ref>[http://www.crickipedia.com/news/I_am_a_Sehwag_fan__says_Desmond_Haynes.html]{{dead link|date=September 2011}} {{dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref>

With Ganguly's injury in the India-England ODI Series in January 2002, Sehwag received another opportunity to open the innings which he seized by scoring 82 from 64 balls in [[Kanpur]] in an eight-wicket Indian victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2001-02/ENG_IN_IND/SCORECARDS/ENG_IND_ODI4_28JAN2002.html |title=4th ODI: India v England at Kanpur, 28 Jan 2002 |publisher=Cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> With good performances as opener, Sehwag was made a permanent fixture at the top of the innings. [[Sachin Tendulkar]], who opened in the England ODI series, was moved to middle order<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/119988.html |title=Cricinfo <U+2013> Pushing Tendulkar and Dravid around |publisher=Content-usa.cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> <U+2013> a strategy that reaped dividends for [[Indian cricket team|India]] in 2002 in ODI matches. In the England series and the preceding tour to South Africa, he compiled 426 runs at 42.6 with four half-centuries {{ref|ODIALL}}.

After modest returns on the tours of the West Indies and England in early and mid 2002, he scored 271 runs at 90.33 in the [[2002 ICC Champions Trophy]] in Sri Lanka, with two man of the match performances.

Even with his inconsistent form, he earned 3 MoM awards in 2004/5 and 2004/05 ODI season with one award each against Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan. In the match against Pakistan in [[Kochi, India|Kochi]] he scored 108 off 95 balls, his first century in eighteen months which set up a 95 run victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2004-05/PAK_IN_IND/SCORECARDS/PAK_IND_ODI1_02APR2005.html |title=1st ODI: India v Pakistan at Kochi, 2 Apr 2005 |publisher=Cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref>

Sehwag started the 2007 World Cup in poor form, only being picked for the side because of Rahul Dravid's wishes. He scored poorly in the first group match but bounced back to hit a magnificent 114 from 87 deliveries against lowly ranked Bermuda. The Indian team scored 413<U+2013>5, the highest team total in a World Cup match, and went on to win the match but this was their only win in the tournament.

On 11 March 2009, Sehwag blasted India's fastest ODI hundred against New Zealand by reaching 3 figures in just 60 balls. Eventually, he led India to win its first series win in New Zealand.

In [[2011]], Sehwag scored his highest ODI score against [[West Indies]] at [[Indore]].

===ODI summary ===
Sehwag's scoring rate is extremely quick, at 103.44 runs per 100 balls (it is exceeded only by one current player: Shahid Afridi, who has a much lower average). He has had more success in run chases, scoring seven of his thirteen centuries while chasing. He has led India on seven occasions, due to the unavailability of the incumbent due to illness, injury or rotation policy. In [[December]] 2011 Sehwag scored 219 in 149 deliveries against [[West Indies]] at [[Indore]]. He has the record of highest individual score in [[ODI]].

In the first test against England in Chennai in December 2008, Sehwag's rapid 83 off just 68 balls,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/indveng/engine/current/match/361050.html |title=1st Test: India v England at Chennai, Dec 11-15, 2008 &#124; Cricket Scorecard &#124; Cricinfo.com |publisher=Content-usa.cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> in the last session of the fourth day, set India up for its record run-chase of 4/387, the highest successful target on Indian soil. He got the man-of-the-match award despite [[Sachin Tendulkar]] scoring an unbeaten century later in the same innings and [[Andrew Strauss]] scoring a century in each of England's innings.

He has been noted for his record against Pakistan, averaging over 90 against and in Pakistan, scoring four centuries against India's arch rivals. The disparity in his average in the first and second innings is often noted, being 68 and 25 and all but one of his fifteen Test centuries having come in the first innings{{ref|TESTSUM}}.

During Sri Lanka's tour of India in 2009, in the 3-match test series he finished with the highest run getter of the series with 491 runs. In the last test match, he made 293 with the help of which India won the test match. In this innings he established many records:
1. Scoring the second fastest 200.
2. Scoring the fastest 250 off just 207 balls.
3. Third highest run scorer on a single day. [284 n.o]
He missed accomplishing the feat of being the only player to score three triple centuries. He was caught and bowled by Murlitharan short by just seven runs. This innings, which consisted of 40 fours and 7 sixes, was described as his third best by him after his two triple centuries.

===Indian Premier League===
Sehwag was the captain of the [[Delhi Daredevils]] in the first two edition of [[Indian Premier League]], before he quit the position to concentrate more on his batting transferring it to [[Gautam Gambhir]]. However, for the fourth edition of [[2011 Indian Premier League|IPL]], he was the only player to be retained by the franchise, again as captain of the Delhi Daredevils.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketdiaries.com/2011/02/11/virender-sehwag-named-delhi-skipper-for-ipl-4/|title=Virender Sehwag named Delhi skipper for IPL 4|publisher=cricketdiaries.com, 11the February 2011, retrieved 11 February 2011|accessdate=2011-09-02|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Sehwag in Non-India Colours===
He was selected in the ICC World XI for the [[2005 ICC Super Series]] against Australia in late 2005, but only managed 64 runs at an average of 21.33 {{ref|ODISUM}}. Earlier in 2005, he was selected for the [[Asian Cricket Council]] XI for the fundraising match against the ICC World XI in the aftermath of the [[2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]],

== Playing style ==
[[Image:Virender Sehwag batting 2.jpg|thumb|Sehwag batting in the nets|left]]
Sehwag was often compared to [[Sachin Tendulkar]] in his early days due to the similar batting style, build and appearance.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> He has acknowledged numerous times that he consciously attempted to model his playing style on Tendulkar's in his youth.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Sehwag's technique is often cited as being particularly unorthodox, often backing away (considered technically incorrect) to free his arms whilst playing his shots, in particular to cut or drive spinners inside out. He is frequently cited by commentators for his extremely strong (physically) square cutting and upper cutting and power through the off-side.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/233300.html |title=Cricinfo <U+2013> Off-side slaughter |publisher=Content-aus.cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1 /> He is also an excellent player of the late cut.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} In particular, his tendency to strike the ball in the air and risk dismissal is a trait which has seen him noted for his chancy and adventurous mindset.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/142474.html |title=Cricinfo <U+2013> Chancy but vital |publisher=Content-aus.cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> He is also noted for a relative lack of footwork,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/135575.html |title=Cricinfo <U+2013> Virender Sehwag's Brave New World |publisher=Content-aus.cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> with his timing often attributed to his eyesight. Of late,{{When|date=August 2011}} Sehwag has shown a proclivity to be dismissed by [[inswing]] deliveries, something attributed to his leaden-footed batting style. He has also got dismissed playing the cut shot when the ball was too close to his body to cut, especially in limited over matches.<ref>''The Indian Express'', 10 April 2007</ref>

Virender Sehwag is often noted for his extremely attacking style of batting, and in 2005 he was described by ''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack'' as the "most exciting opener in the world"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/156012.html |title=Cricinfo |publisher=Content-usa.cricinfo.com |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref>  due to his aggressive style in [[Test Cricket|Test matches]], his strike rate being inferior only to that of [[Adam Gilchrist]] and [[Shahid Afridi]]. Sehwag has also been noted for his apparent disregard for the match situation, exhibited by aggressive batting even when his team is in a poor position or after being out-manoeuvred by the bowler in the recent past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/140476.html |title=Cricinfo <U+2013> Watching Sehwag bat |publisher=Content-aus.cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> This is a two-edged sword, as it allows him to not be psychologically hindered by previous failures, but can also lead to excessive aggression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/126132.html |title=Cricinfo <U+2013> The sublime savage |publisher=Content-aus.cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> He was quoted by Pakistan coach [[Bob Woolmer]] as a sophisticated slogger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/233298.html |title=Cricinfo <U+2013> Sophisticated slogging |publisher=Content-aus.cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> But over the years, his style has changed from "reckless hitting" to that of "controlled aggression", according to an article in the ''Sydney Morning Herald''. Previously Sehwag was known predominantly as an offside player, with a weakness against straight short pitched bowling. However in the last two years{{When|date=August 2011}} he has improved his leg side and bouncer hitting considerably. This is shown in the recent ODIs against New Zealand where he utilised the pull, hook and flick shots to devastating effect. 

As of 15 March 2010, Sehwag has an average of nearly 68 in the first innings of test matches where he has scored 5130 runs, 18 centuries and 12 fifties in 76 matches. In the second innings, his average drops to 31 and has scored 1561 runs, an only century and 9 fifties in 54 innings. The first and second innings difference of 37 runs is one of the highest and indicates a lack of ability in dealing with more difficult batting conditions as the pitch deteriorates. However, his match-saving second-innings 151 against Australia at Adelaide during the 2007<U+2013>08 Border-Gavaskar series, and a match winning 92 in trying situations at Nagpur during the 2008<U+2013>09 series, went a long way towards repairing that image. In the 2008 Test series against England, Sehwag played a key role in the fourth innings of the first Test in Chennai. He amassed 83 runs in 68 balls, which helped India chase down an improbable target of 387 with six wickets to spare. This was the highest successful run chase in India, and the fourth highest in Test history. For this effort, Sehwag was adjudged Man of the Match. On 12 August 2011, Sehwag became only the third Indian in history to achieve a king pair (2 golden ducks consecutively) and the 15th player to do that of all time, but weeks later he again scored crucial and agressive pair of 55 against West Indies.

==Controversy==
{{main|Mike Denness and Indian cricket team incident}}
In November 2001, Sehwag was involved in controversy in the Second [[Test Cricket|Test match]] between [[Indian cricket team|India]] and [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] at [[Sahara Oval St George's|St George's Park]], [[Port Elizabeth]], when he was given a one Test ban for "excessive appealing" by ICC Match referee [[Mike Denness]]. He was one of six Indian players to receive bans, four of which were suspended bans. The unprecedented severity of the bans precipitated an international cricketing, political and administrative crisis, with the Indian cricket establishment threatening to call off the tour unless Mike Denness was removed as match referee from the third test match. [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] backed Mike Denness<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/108172.html |title=Cricinfo <U+2013> ICC rules out replacing Denness for final Test |publisher=Content-usa.cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> and the South African board backed the Indian cricket establishment<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/108130.html |title=Cricinfo <U+2013> South Africa will back India in Denness affair |publisher=Content-usa.cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> and did not allow Mike Denness to enter the stadium<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/southafrica/content/story/108207.html |title=Cricinfo <U+2013> UCBSA issues statement regarding third Castle Lager/MTN Test |publisher=Content-usa.cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> on the first day of the third test match.

The subsequent [[England cricket team|England]] tour to [[Indian cricket team|India]] was placed in jeopardy when India picked Sehwag in the test squad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/106932.html |title=Cricinfo <U+2013> India name Sehwag in 14-member squad for Mohali Test |publisher=Content-usa.cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> Subsequent to this development, ICC issued a warning that any match with Sehwag in the cricket team will not be considered an "official" Test match until Sehwag had served his one match ban.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/106857.html |title=Cricinfo <U+2013> Centurion Match Is Not a Test and Sehwag Ban Will Stand, Says ICC |publisher=Cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> After negotiations with ECB and ICC and in general interest of cricket, Sehwag was dropped from the team for the first Test against England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/107027.html |title=Mohali Test will go ahead after BCCI agree to exclude Sehwag |publisher=Cricinfo |accessdate=12 February 2010}}</ref>

==Personal life==

Sehwag married Aarti Ahlawat in April 2004 under heavy security cover in a widely publicised wedding hosted by [[Arun Jaitley]], the then Union law minister of India, at his residence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/134639.html |title=Cricinfo <U+2013> Sehwag ties the knot |publisher=Content-aus.cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref> The couple have a son, Aryavir, born on 18 October 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thatscricket.oneindia.in/news/2007/10/20/2010sehwag-wife-gives-birth-to-a-baby-boy.html |title=Sehwag's wife gives birth to a baby boy |publisher=Thatscricket.oneindia.in |date=20 October 2007 |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.iplt20.com/sehwag-ii-another-hard-hitter-in-the-making.html Sehwag II <U+2013> another hard-hitter in the making]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref>

Sehwag is fondly referred to in the media as the ''Nawab of Najafgarh'', [[Najafgarh]] being his home locality in [[Delhi]]. A lifelong vegetarian, Sehwag owns a vegetarian eatery, ''Sehwag Favourites'', which opened in late 2005 at the Fun Republic cineplex in Delhi, following in the footsteps of his role model Sachin Tendulkar. The majority of the products on the menu are named after cricketing themes related to his memorable innings, such as ''Multan Ke Sultan Ki Tikdi'', meaning dish for three persons, which alludes to his triple century in Multan and is priced at 309 rupees. There are plans to expand the chain across India with a second outlet already planned in [[Ludhiana]]. Sehwag does charity work for [[UNICEF]]{{ref|HOME}}.
