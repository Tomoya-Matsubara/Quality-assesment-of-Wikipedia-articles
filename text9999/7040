'''Thomas James Lynch''' (April 3, 1860 - March 28, 1955) was a [[Major League Baseball]] player. He played two seasons in the majors, {{By|1884}} and {{By|1885}}. He made his debut in the short-lived [[Union Association]] with the even shorter-lived [[Wilmington Quicksteps]], where he started 16 games during their 18-game tenure<U+2014>8 as a [[catcher]] and 8 as an [[outfielder]]. After the Quicksteps folded, Lynch resurfaced later in 1884 with the [[Philadelphia Phillies|Philadelphia Quakers]], where he also equally split his time between catching and outfield duties. He finished up his career with the Quakers in 1885, playing 13 games in the outfield.
