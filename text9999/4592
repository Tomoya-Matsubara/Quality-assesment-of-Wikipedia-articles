'''Kochari'''  ({{Lang-hy|<U+0554><U+0578><U+0579><U+0561><U+0580><U+056B>}}; {{lang-tr|Ko<U+00E7>ari}}; {{lang-gr|<U+039A><U+03CC><U+03C4><U+03C3><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03B9>}}; {{lang-ka|<U+10E5><U+10DD><U+10E9><U+10D0><U+10E0><U+10D8>}}; [[Laz language|Laz]]: Ko<U+00E7>ari; {{lang-az|K<U+00F6><U+00E7><U+0259>ri}}), is a [[folk dance]] from the [[Kars Province|Kars]]<ref>http://www.dolmetsch.com/defsk1.htm</ref> and [[Artvin Province|Artvin]] provinces of [[Turkey]].  

This culturally rich region consisting of Kars, Ardahan, and Artvin provinces has historically been part of many kingdoms and nations including [[Kingdom of Pontus]] and [[Kingdom of Armenia]]. 

In many [[Turkic languages]], Kochari means "nomad" (K<U+00F6><U+00E7><U+0259>ri, Gochar, Go<U+00E7>ede).

Kochari is closely related to the "Haleh" or "[[Halay]]", a dance common to Turks, Armenians, and Kurds, and although there are differences the most basic form of the Armenian Halay is the same as Kochari.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

"Govand" is also part of this family of dances.

== Pontic kotsari ==
The [[Pontic Greeks]]<ref>Greece - Page 67 by Paul Hellander, Kate Armstrong, Michael Clark, Des Hannigan, Victoria Kyriakopoulos, Miriam Raphael, Andrew Ston</ref> and [[Armenians]] have many vigorous warlike dances such as the Kochari. 

Unlike most Pontic dances, the Kotsari is in an even rhythm (2/4), originally danced in a closed circle. The dance is very popular today; however, it is often danced differently from the original. There is a consistent, vicious double bounce, also referred to as tremoulo. It is danced hand to shoulder and travels to the right. There are few variations which may be added to the step. It's a dance that tries to fear the viewers. At the start, it is danced by both men and women. Then, men go in front and do their figures.
