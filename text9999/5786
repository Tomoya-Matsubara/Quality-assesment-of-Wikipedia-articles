'''Saffron''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8>s<U+00E6>fr<U+0259>n/, /<U+02C8>s<U+00E6>fr<U+0252>n}}) is a [[spice]] derived from the [[flower]] of the '''saffron crocus''' (''Crocus sativus''), a species of [[crocus]] in the family [[Iridaceae]]. The flower has three [[Carpel|stigma]]s, which are the [[anatomical terms of location|distal]] ends of the plant's [[carpel]]s. Together with its style, the stalk connecting the stigmas to the rest of the plant, these components are often [[food preservation|dried]] and used in [[cooking]] as a [[seasoning]] and [[food coloring|colouring agent]]. Saffron, which has for decades been the world's most expensive spice by weight,<ref name="Rau_53">{{Harvnb|Rau|1969|p=53}}.</ref><ref name="Hill_272">{{Harvnb|Hill|2004|p=272}}.</ref> is native to [[Southwest Asia]].<ref name="Hill_272">{{Harvnb|Hill|2004|p=272}}.</ref><ref name="Grigg_287">{{Harvnb|Grigg|1974|p=287}}.</ref> It was first [[agriculture|cultivated]] in the vicinity of [[Greece]].<ref name="McGee_422">{{Harvnb|McGee|2004|p=422}}.</ref>

Saffron is characterised by a bitter [[basic taste|taste]] and an [[iodoform]]- or [[hay]]-like fragrance; these are caused by the [[chemical]]s [[picrocrocin]] and [[safranal]].<ref name="McGee_423">{{Harvnb|McGee|2004|p=423}}.</ref><ref name="Katzer_2001">{{Harvnb|Katzer|2001}}.</ref> It also contains a [[carotenoid]] dye, [[crocin]], that gives food a rich golden-yellow hue. These traits make saffron a much-sought ingredient in many foods worldwide. Saffron also has [[medicine|medicinal]] applications.

The word ''saffron'' originated from the 12th-century [[Old French]] term ''{{lang|fr|safran}}'', which derives from the [[Latin]] word ''{{lang|la|safranum}}''. ''{{lang|la|Safranum}}'' is also related to the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''{{lang|it|zafferano}}'' and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''{{lang|es|azafr<U+00E1>n}}''.<ref name="Harper_2001">{{Harvnb|Harper|2001}}.</ref> ''Safranum'' comes from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''{{ArabDIN|a<U+1E63>far}}'' ({{rtl-lang|ar|<U+0623><U+064E><U+0635><U+0652><U+0641><U+064E><U+0631>}}), which means "[[yellow]]," via the [[paronym]]ous ''{{ArabDIN|za<U+02BB>far<U+0101>n}}'' ({{rtl-lang|ar|<U+0632><U+064E><U+0639><U+0652><U+0641><U+064E><U+0631><U+064E><U+0627><U+0646>}}), the name of the spice in Arabic.<ref name="Katzer_2001">{{Harvnb|Katzer|2001}}.</ref>

The domesticated saffron crocus ''C. sativus'' is an autumn-[[flowering plant|flowering]] [[perennial plant]] unknown in the wild, and is a sterile [[polyploidy|triploid]] mutant of the eastern Mediterranean autumn-flowering ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]''.<ref name="Deo_1">{{Harvnb|Deo|2003|p=1}}.</ref> According to botanical research, ''C. cartwrightianus'' originated in [[Crete]], not&mdash;as was once generally believed&mdash;in [[Central Asia]].<ref name="Katzer_2001">{{Harvnb|Katzer|2001}}.</ref> The saffron crocus resulted when ''C. cartwrightianus'' was subjected to extensive [[artificial selection]] by growers who desired elongated stigmas. Being sterile, the saffron crocus's purple flowers fail to produce viable seeds&mdash;thus, reproduction is dependent on human assistance: the [[corm]]s (underground bulb-like starch-storing organs) must be manually dug up, broken apart, and replanted. A corm survives for only one season, reproducing via division into up to ten "cormlets" that eventually give rise to new plants.<ref name="Deo_1">{{Harvnb|Deo|2003|p=1}}.</ref> The corms are small brown globules up to 4.5&nbsp;[[metre|cm]] in diameter and are shrouded in a dense mat of parallel fibers. 

After a period of [[estivation|aestivation]] in summer, five to eleven narrow and nearly vertical green leaves&mdash;growing up to 40&nbsp;cm in length&mdash;emerge from the ground. In autumn, purple buds appear. Only in October, after most other flowering plants have released their seeds, does it develop its brilliantly hued flowers, ranging from a light pastel shade of [[lilac (color)|lilac]] to a darker and more striated [[mauve]].<ref name="Willard_3">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=3}}.</ref> Upon flowering, it averages less than 30&nbsp;cm in height.<ref name="DPIWE_2005">{{Harvnb|DPIWE|2005}}.</ref> Inside each flower is a three-pronged style; in turn, each prong terminates with a crimson stigma 25<U+2013>30&nbsp;[[metre|mm]] in length.<ref name="Deo_1">{{Harvnb|Deo|2003|p=1}}.</ref>

== Cultivation ==
[[Image:Crocus sativus2.jpg|thumb|right|Two saffron crocus flowers in [[Osaka Prefecture]], [[Japan]].]]
The saffron crocus thrives in climates similar to that of the Mediterranean [[Maquis shrubland| maquis]] or the [[North America]]n [[chaparral]], where hot, dry summer breezes blow across arid and semi-arid lands. Nevertheless, the plant can tolerate cold winters, surviving frosts as cold as &minus;10 <U+00B0>C and short periods of snow cover.<ref name="Willard_2-3">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|pp= 2<U+2013>3}}.</ref><ref name ="Deo_1">{{Harvnb|Deo|2003|p= 1}}.</ref> However, if not grown in wet environments like Kashmir (where rainfall averages 1000<U+2013>1500&nbsp;mm annually), [[irrigation]] is needed&mdash;this is true in the saffron-growing regions of Greece (500&nbsp;mm of rainfall annually) and Spain (400&nbsp;mm). Rainfall timing is also key: generous spring rains followed by relatively dry summers are optimal. In addition, rainfall occurring immediately prior to flowering also boosts saffron yields; nevertheless, rainy or cold weather occurring ''during'' flowering promotes disease, thereby reducing yields. Persistently damp and hot conditions also harm yields,<ref name= "Deo_2">{{Harvnb |Deo|2003|p=2}}.</ref> as do the digging actions of rabbits, rats, and birds. Parasites such as [[roundworm|nematodes]], leaf [[rust (fungus)|rusts]], and corm rot also pose significant threats.<ref name="Deo_3">{{Harvnb|Deo|2003|p=3}}.</ref>

Saffron plants grow best in strong and direct sunlight, and fare poorly in shady conditions. Thus, planting is best done in fields that slope towards the sunlight (i.e. south-sloping in the Northern Hemisphere), maximizing the crocuses' sun exposure. In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], planting is mostly done in June, with corms planted some 7<U+2013>15&nbsp;cm deep. Planting depth and corm spacing<U+2014>along with climate&mdash;are both critical factors impacting plant yields. Thus, mother corms planted more deeply yield higher-quality saffron, although they produce fewer flower buds and daughter corms. With such knowledge, Italian growers have found that planting corms {{cm to in|15|spell=commonwealth}} deep and in rows spaced 2<U+2013>3&nbsp;cm apart optimizes threads yields, whereas planting depths of 8<U+2013>10&nbsp;cm optimizes flower and corm production. Meanwhile, Greek, Moroccan, and Spanish growers have devised different depths and spacings to suit their own climates.<ref name = "Deo_2">{{Harvnb |Deo|2003| p = 2}}.</ref>

Saffron crocuses grow best in friable, loose, low-density, well-watered, and well-drained clay-[[calcareous]] soils with high organic content. Raised beds are traditionally used to promote good drainage. Historically, soil organic content was boosted via application of some 20<U+2013>30&nbsp;tonnes of manure per [[hectare]]. Afterwards&mdash;and with no further manure application&mdash;corms were planted.<ref name="Deo_3">{{Harvnb|Deo|2003|p=3}}.</ref> After a period of dormancy through the summer, the corms send up their narrow leaves and begin to bud in early autumn. Only in mid-autumn do the plants begin to flower. Harvesting of flowers is by necessity a speedy affair: after their flowering at dawn, flowers quickly wilt as the day passes.<ref name = "Willard_3-4">{{Harvnb |Willard|2001|pp=3<U+2013>4}}.</ref> Furthermore, saffron crocuses bloom within a narrow window spanning one or two weeks.<ref name="Willard_4">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=4}}.</ref> Approximately 150 flowers yield 1&nbsp;[[gram|g]] of dry saffron threads; to produce 12&nbsp;g of dried saffron (72&nbsp;g freshly harvested), 1 kg of flowers are needed (1 lb for 0.2 oz of dried saffron). On average, one freshly picked flower yields 0.03&nbsp;g of fresh saffron, or 0.007&nbsp;g of dried saffron.<ref name="Deo_3">{{Harvnb|Deo|2003|p=3}}.</ref>

Saffron contains more than 150 volatile and aroma-yielding compounds. It also has many nonvolatile active components,<ref name="Abdullaev_1">{{Harvnb|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}}.</ref> many of which are carotenoids, including [[zeaxanthin]], [[lycopene]], and various <U+03B1>- and <U+03B2>-[[carotene]]s. However, saffron's golden yellow-orange colour is primarily the result of <U+03B1>-crocin. This crocin is trans-[[crocetin]] di-(<U+03B2>-D-[[gentiobiose|gentiobiosyl]]) [[ester]] ([[IUPAC nomenclature|systematic (IUPAC) name]]: 8,8-diapo-8,8-carotenoic acid). This means that the crocin underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin.<ref name="Abdullaev_1">{{Harvnb|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}}.</ref> Crocins themselves are a series of [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] carotenoids that are either [[glycosyl|monoglycosyl]] or diglycosyl [[polyene]] esters of crocetin.<ref name="Abdullaev_1">{{Harvnb|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}}.</ref> Meanwhile, crocetin is a [[conjugated system|conjugated]] polyene [[carboxylic acid|dicarboxylic acid]] that is [[hydrophile|hydrophobic]], and thus oil-soluble. When crocetin is [[esterification|esterified]] with two water-soluble gentiobioses (which are [[carbohydrate|sugars]]), a product results that is itself water-soluble. The resultant <U+03B1>-crocin is a carotenoid pigment that may comprise more than 10% of dry saffron's mass. The two esterified gentiobioses make <U+03B1>-crocin ideal for colouring water-based (non-fatty) foods such as rice dishes.<ref name="McGee_422">{{Harvnb|McGee|2004|p=422}}.</ref>

The bitter [[glucoside]] picrocrocin is responsible for saffron's flavour. Picrocrocin ([[chemical formula]]: C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>26</sub>O<sub>7</sub>; systematic name: 4-(<U+03B2>-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,6,6- trimethylcyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxaldehyde) is a union of an [[aldehyde]] sub-element known as safranal (systematic name: 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexa-1,3-dien-1- carboxaldehyde) and a carbohydrate. It has insecticidal and pesticidal properties, and may comprise up to 4% of dry saffron. Significantly, picrocrocin is a truncated version (produced via [[redox|oxidative]] cleavage) of the carotenoid [[zeaxanthin]] and is the [[glycoside]] of the [[terpene]] [[aldehyde]] safranal. The reddish-coloured<ref name="Leffingwell_1">{{Harvnb|Leffingwell|2001|p=1}}.</ref> zeaxanthin is, incidentally, one of the carotenoids naturally present within the [[retina]] of the human [[eye]].

When saffron is dried after its harvest, the heat, combined with enzymatic action, splits picrocrocin to yield [[Monosaccharide#Isomerism|D]]-[[glucose]] and a free safranal molecule.<ref name="Deo_4">{{Harvnb|Deo|2003|p=4}}.</ref> Safranal, a [[essential oil|volatile]] oil, gives saffron much of its distinctive aroma.<ref name="McGee_423">{{Harvnb|McGee|2004|p=423}}.</ref><ref name="Dharmananda">{{Harvnb|Dharmananda|2005}}.</ref> Safranal is less bitter than picrocrocin and may comprise up to 70% of dry saffron's volatile fraction in some samples.<ref name="Leffingwell_1">{{Harvnb|Leffingwell|2001|p=1}}.</ref> A second element underlying saffron's aroma is 2-hydroxy-4,4,6-trimethyl-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one, the scent of which has been described as "saffron, dried hay like".<ref name="Leffingwell_2001_3">{{Harvnb|Leffingwell|2001|p=3}}.</ref> Chemists found this to be the most powerful contributor to saffron's fragrance despite its being present in a lesser quantity than safranal.<ref name="Leffingwell_2001_3">{{Harvnb|Leffingwell|2001|p=3}}.</ref> Dry saffron is highly sensitive to fluctuating [[pH]] levels, and rapidly breaks down chemically in the presence of [[light]] and [[redox|oxidizing]] agents. It must therefore be stored away in air-tight containers in order to minimise contact with atmospheric oxygen. Saffron is somewhat more resistant to heat.

{{main|History of saffron}}
The history of saffron cultivation reaches back more than 3,000 years.<ref name="Deo_1">{{Harvnb|Deo|2003|p=1}}.</ref> The wild precursor of domesticated saffron crocus was ''Crocus cartwrightianus''. Human cultivators bred wild specimens by selecting for unusually long stigmas. Thus, a sterile mutant form of ''C. cartwrightianus'', ''C. sativus'', emerged in late [[Bronze Age]] [[Crete]].<ref name="Goyns_1">{{Harvnb|Goyns|1999|p=1}}.</ref> Experts believe saffron was first documented in a 7th century [[Before Christ|BC]] [[Assyria]]n botanical reference compiled under [[Ashurbanipal]]. Since then, documentation of saffron's use over the span of 4,000 years in the treatment of some 90 illnesses has been uncovered.<ref name="Honan_2004">{{Harvnb|Honan|2004}}.</ref> Saffron has been used as a spice and medicine in the Mediterranean region since then, with usage and cultivation slowly spreading to other parts of Eurasia as well as [[North Africa]] and [[North America]]. In the last several decades, saffron cultivation has spread to [[Oceania]].

Theories explaining saffron's arrival in [[South Asia]] conflict.

Some historians believe that saffron first came to China with Mongol invaders by way of Persia.<ref name = "Fletcher_2005_11">{{harvnb |Fletcher|2005| p = 11}}.</ref> On the other hand, saffron is mentioned in ancient Chinese medical texts, including the forty-volume ''Shennong Bencaojing'' (<U+795E><U+8FB2><U+672C><U+8349><U+7D93><U+2014>"Shennong's Great Herbal", also known as ''Pen Ts'ao'' or ''Pun Tsao'') pharmacopoeia, a tome dating from 200<U+2013>300 BC<!--From Hayes 2001 (needs to be further verified): around 2735 BC-->. <!--From Hayes 2001: Written by-->Traditionally attributed to the legendary ''Yan'' ("Fire") Emperor (<U+708E><U+5E1D>) [[Shennong]], it documents 252 phytochemical-based medical treatments for various disorders.<ref name = "Hayes_6">{{Harvnb |Hayes|2001| p = 6}}.</ref><ref name="SNL_2005">{{Harvnb|Shen-Nong Limited| 2005}}.</ref><ref name="Tarvand_2005">{{Harvnb|Tarvand| 2005}}.</ref> Yet around the 3rd century AD, the Chinese were referring to saffron as having a Kashmiri provenance.

=== Europe ===
[[Image:Thomas Becket Murder.JPG|thumb|right|Medieval European [[illuminated manuscript]]s, such as this 13th century depiction of [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Thomas Becket]]'s assassination, often used saffron dyes to provide hues of [[yellow]] and [[orange (color)|orange]].]]

In [[Europe]], saffron cultivation declined steeply following the Roman Empire's fall. Saffron was reintroduced when Moorish civilization spread to [[Al-Andalus|Spain]], France, and Italy.<ref name="Willard_70">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=70}}.</ref> During the 14th century [[Black Death]], demand for saffron-based medicine skyrocketed, and much saffron had to be imported via Venetian and Genoan ships from southern and Mediterranean lands<ref name="Willard_99">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=99}}.</ref> such as [[Rhodes]]. The theft of one such shipment by noblemen sparked the fourteen-week long "Saffron War".<ref name="Willard_99">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=99}}.</ref> The conflict and resulting fear of rampant saffron piracy spurred significant saffron cultivation in [[Basel]], which grew prosperous.<ref name="Willard_101">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=101}}.</ref> Cultivation and trade then spread to [[Nuremberg]], where epidemic levels of saffron adulteration brought on the ''Safranschou'' code, under which saffron adulterers were fined, imprisoned, and executed.<ref name="Willard_103-104">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|pp=103<U+2013>104}}.</ref> Soon after, saffron cultivation spread throughout England, especially [[Norfolk]] and [[Suffolk]]. The Essex town of [[Saffron Walden]], named for its new specialty crop, emerged as England's prime saffron growing and trading center. However, an influx of more exotic spices such as [[chocolate]], [[coffee]], [[tea]], and [[vanilla]] from newly contacted Eastern and overseas countries caused European cultivation and usage of saffron to decline.<ref name="Willard_117">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=117}}.</ref><ref name="Willard_132-133">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|pp=132<U+2013>133}}.</ref> Only in southern France, Italy, and Spain, did significant cultivation endure.<ref name="Willard_133">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=133}}.</ref>

Europeans brought saffron to the [[Americas]] when immigrant members of the [[Schwenkfelder Church]] left Europe with a trunk containing saffron corms; indeed, many Schwenkfelders had widely grown saffron in Europe.<ref name="Willard_143">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=143}}.</ref> By 1730, the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] were cultivating saffron throughout eastern [[Pennsylvania]]. Spanish colonies in the Caribbean bought large amounts of this new American saffron, and high demand ensured that saffron's list price on the [[Philadelphia]] commodities exchange was set equal to that of [[gold]].<ref name="Willard_138">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=138}}.</ref> The trade with the Caribbean later collapsed in the aftermath of the [[War of 1812]], when many saffron-transporting merchant vessels were destroyed.<ref name="Willard_138-139">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|pp=138<U+2013>139}}.</ref> Yet the Pennsylvania Dutch continued to grow lesser amounts of saffron for local trade and use in their cakes, noodles, and chicken or trout dishes.<ref name="Willard_142-146">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|pp=142<U+2013>146}}.</ref> American saffron cultivation survived into modern times mainly in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]].<ref name="Willard_143">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=143}}.</ref>

:{{main|Trade and use of saffron}}

Saffron's aroma is often described by connoisseurs as reminiscent of metallic honey with [[grass]]y or [[hay]]-like notes, while its taste has been noted also as hay-like and somewhat bitter. Saffron also contributes a luminous yellow-orange colouring to foods. Saffron is widely used in [[Persian cuisine|Persian]], [[Arab cuisine|Arab]], Central [[Asian cuisine|Asian]], [[European cuisine|European]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], [[Cuisine of Iran|Iranian]], [[Cuisine of Morocco|Moroccan]] and [[Cornwall|Cornish]] cuisines. Confectionaries and liquors also often include saffron. Common saffron substitutes include [[safflower]] (''Carthamus tinctorius'', which is often sold as "Portuguese saffron" or "assafroa") and [[turmeric]] (''Curcuma longa''). Medicinally, saffron has a long history as part of traditional healing; modern medicine has also discovered saffron as having [[anticarcinogen]]ic (cancer-suppressing),<ref name="Abdullaev_1">{{Harvnb|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}}.</ref> anti-mutagenic (mutation-preventing), immunomodulating, and [[antioxidant]]-like properties.<ref name="Assimopoulou_2005">{{Harvnb|Assimopoulou|2005|p=1}}.</ref><ref name="Abdullaev_1">{{Harvnb|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}}.</ref><ref name="Chang">{{Harvnb|Chang|Kuo|Wang|1964|p=1}}.</ref> Saffron has also been used as a fabric [[dye]], particularly in [[China]] and [[India]], and in perfumery.

Most saffron is grown in a belt of land ranging from the Mediterranean in the west to Kashmir in the east. Annually, around 300&nbsp;tonnes of saffron are produced worldwide.<ref name="Katzer_2001">{{Harvnb|Katzer|2001}}.</ref> [[Iran]], [[Spain]], [[India]], [[Greece]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Morocco]], and [[Italy]] (in decreasing order of production) are the major producers of saffron. A pound of dry saffron (0.45&nbsp;kg) requires 50,000<U+2013>75,000 flowers, the equivalent of a football field's area of cultivation.<ref name="Hill_273">{{Harvnb|Hill|2004|p=273}}.</ref><ref name="Rau_35">{{Harvnb|Rau|1969|p=35}}.</ref> Some forty hours of frenetic day-and-night labour are needed to pick 150,000 flowers.<ref name="Lak_1998">{{Harvnb|Lak|1998}}.</ref> Upon extraction, stigmas are dried quickly and (preferably) sealed in airtight containers.<ref name="Goyns_8">{{Harvnb|Goyns|1999|p=8}}.</ref> Saffron prices at wholesale and retail rates range from US$500/pound to US$5,000/pound (US$1100<U+2013>US$11,000 per kilogram)<U+2014>equivalent to <U+00A3>2,500/<U+20AC>3,500 per pound or <U+00A3>5,500/<U+20AC>7,500 per kilo.

Vivid crimson colouring, slight moistness, elasticity, recent harvest date, and lack of broken-off thread debris are all traits of fresh saffron.

== Cultivars ==
[[Image:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|left|Saffron threads (red-coloured stigmas) mixed with styles (yellow) from Iran.]]

Several saffron [[cultivar]]s are grown worldwide. Spain's varieties, including the tradenames 'Spanish Superior' and 'Creme', are generally mellower in colour, flavour, and aroma; they are graded by government-imposed standards. Italian varieties are more potent, while the most intense varieties tend to be [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonian Greek]], [[Iran]]ian, and [[India]]n in origin. Westerners may face significant obstacles in obtaining saffron from India. For example, India has banned the export of high-grade saffron abroad. Aside from these, various "boutique" crops are available from New Zealand, France, Switzerland, England, the United States, and other countries, some [[organically grown]]. In the U.S., Pennsylvania Dutch saffron<U+2014>known for its earthy notes<U+2014>is marketed in small quantities.<ref name="Willard_143">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=143}}.</ref><ref name="Willard_201">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=201}}.</ref>

[[Image:Red-crocus-thread-greek-v2.jpg|thumb|right|Close-up of a single crocus thread (the dried stigma). Actual length is about {{mm to in|20}}.]]

Consumers regard certain cultivars as "premium" quality. The "Aquila" saffron (''zafferano dell'Aquila'')<U+2014>defined by high safranal and crocin content, shape, unusually pungent aroma, and intense colour<U+2014>is grown exclusively on eight hectares in the Navelli Valley of Italy's [[Abruzzo]] region, near [[L'Aquila]]. It was first introduced to Italy by a Dominican monk from [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition-era]] Spain. But in Italy the biggest saffron cultivation, for quality and quantity, is in San Gavino Monreale, [[Sardinia]]. There, saffron is grown on 40 hectares (60% of Italian production); it also has very high crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal content. Another is the Kashmiri "Mongra" or "Lacha" saffron (''Crocus sativus'' 'Cashmirianus'), which is among the most difficult for consumers to obtain. Repeated droughts, blights, and crop failures in Kashmir, combined with an Indian export ban, contribute to its high prices. Kashmiri saffron is recognisable by its extremely dark maroon-purple hue, among the world's darkest, which suggests the saffron's strong flavour, aroma, and colourative effect.

Saffron types are graded by quality according to laboratory measurements of such characteristics as crocin (colour), picrocrocin (taste), and safranal (fragrance) content. Other metrics include floral waste content (i.e. the saffron spice sample's non-stigma floral content) and measurements of other extraneous matter such as inorganic material ("ash"). A uniform set of international standards in saffron grading was established by the [[International Organization for Standardization]], which is an international federation of national standards bodies. Namely, ISO 3632 deals exclusively with saffron. It establishes four empirical grades of colour intensity: IV (poorest), III, II, and I (finest quality). Saffron samples are then assigned to one of these grades by gauging the spice's crocin content, which is revealed by measurements of crocin-specific spectroscopic [[absorbance]]. Absorbance is defined as <math>A_\lambda = -\log(I/I_0)</math>, with <math>A_\lambda</math> as absorbance ([[Beer-Lambert law]]). It is a measure of a given substance's transparency (<math>I/I_0</math>, the ratio of light intensity passing through sample to that of the incident light) to a given wavelength of light.

For saffron, absorbance is determined for the crocin-specific [[photon]] [[wavelength]] of 440 [[nanometer|nm]] in a given dry sample of spice.<ref name="Tarvand_2005b"> {{Harvnb|Tarvand|2005b}}.</ref> Higher absorbances at this wavelength imply greater crocin concentration, and thus a greater colourative intensity. These data are measured through [[spectrophotometry]] reports at certified testing laboratories worldwide. These colour grades proceed from grades with absorbances lower than 80 (for all category IV saffron) up to 190 or greater (for category I). The world's finest samples (the selected most red-maroon tips of stigmas picked from the finest flowers) receive absorbance scores in excess of 250. Market prices for saffron types follow directly from these ISO scores.<ref name="Tarvand_2005b"> {{Harvnb|Tarvand|2005b}}.</ref> However, many growers, traders, and consumers reject such lab test numbers. They prefer a more holistic method of sampling batches of thread for taste, aroma, pliability, and other traits in a fashion similar to that practiced by practised wine tasters.<ref name="Hill_274">{{Harvnb|Hill|2004|p=274}}.</ref>

Despite such attempts at quality control and standardisation, an extensive history of saffron adulteration&mdash;particularly among the cheapest grades&mdash;continues into modern times. Adulteration was first documented in Europe's Middle Ages, when those found selling adulterated saffron were executed under the ''Safranschou'' code.<ref name="Willard_102-104">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|pp=102<U+2013>104}}.</ref> Typical methods include mixing in extraneous substances like [[beet]], pomegranate fibers, red-dyed [[silk]] fibers, or the saffron crocus's tasteless and odorless yellow stamens. Other methods included dousing saffron fibers with viscid substances like honey or vegetable oil. However, powdered saffron is more prone to adulteration, with turmeric, paprika, and other powders used as diluting fillers. Adulteration can also consist of selling mislabeled mixes of different saffron grades.<ref name="Tarvand_2005">{{Harvnb|Tarvand|2005}}.</ref> Thus, in India, high-grade Kashmiri saffron is often sold mixed with cheaper Iranian imports; these mixes are then marketed as pure Kashmiri saffron, a development that has cost Kashmiri growers much of their income.<ref name="ABC">{{Harvnb|Australian Broadcasting Corporation|2003}}.</ref><ref name="Hussain">{{Harvnb|Hussain|2005}}.</ref>
