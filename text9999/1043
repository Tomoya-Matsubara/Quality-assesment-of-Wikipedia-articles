The '''epaulette shark''', ''Hemiscyllium ocellatum'', is a species of [[Hemiscylliidae|longtailed carpet shark]], [[family (biology)|family]] Hemiscylliidae, found in shallow, tropical waters off [[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]] (and possibly elsewhere). The [[common name]] of this shark comes from the very large, white-margined black spot behind each [[pectoral fin]], which are reminiscent of military [[epaulette]]s. A small species usually under 1 m (3.3 ft) long, the epaulette shark has a slender body with a short head and broad, paddle-shaped paired fins. The [[caudal peduncle]] (to which the [[caudal fin|tail fin]] is attached) comprises over half the shark's length. Adults are light brown above, with scattered darker spots and indistinct saddles.

Epaulette sharks have [[nocturnal]] habits and frequent shallow water on [[coral reef]]s or in [[tidal pool]]s. This shark has evolved to cope with the severe nighttime [[oxygen]] depletion ([[hypoxia]]) in isolated tidal pools by increasing the blood supply to its brain and selectively shutting down non-essential neural functions. It is capable of surviving complete [[anoxia]] for an hour without ill effects, and at a much higher temperature than most other hypoxia-tolerant animals. Rather than swim, epaulette sharks walk by wriggling their bodies and pushing with their paired fins. This species feeds on a wide range of small [[benthic]] [[invertebrate]]s and [[bony fish]]es. Epaulette sharks are [[oviparous]], with females depositing pairs of egg capsules around every 14 days from August to December. Due to their hardiness and small size, epaulette sharks are popular with both [[public aquarium|public]] and [[fishkeeping|home aquaria]]. The [[World Conservation Union]] has assessed this species as of [[Least Concern]], as outside of the small aquarium trade it is of little interest to [[fishery|fisheries]].

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The epaulette shark was originally described as ''Squalus ocellatus'' by the French [[naturalist]] [[Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre]] in the 1788 ''[[Tableau encyclop<U+00E9>dique et m<U+00E9>thodique|Tableau encyclop<U+00E9>dique et m<U+00E9>thodique des trois r<U+00E8>gnes de la nature]]''. The name was later changed to the currently valid ''Hemiscyllium ocellatum''. The [[type specimen]] was a 35 cm (14 in) long immature male caught near [[Cookstown]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]].<ref name="compagno">{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V. |date=2002 |title=Sharks of the World: An Annotated and Illustrated Catalogue of Shark Species Known to Date (Volume 2) |place=Rome |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization |isbn=9251045437 |pages=181&ndash;182}}</ref> Other common names for this species are the itar shark and the blind shark (also used for ''[[Brachaelurus waddi]]'').<ref name="fishbase">{{fishbase species |genus=Hemiscyllium |species=ocellatum |month=May |year=2009}}</ref> Goto's 2002 [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] analysis of the [[carpet shark]]s showed the genus ''Hemiscyllium'' as a [[polytomy]], meaning that the [[phylogenetic]] relationships between the epaulette shark and its sister species could not be resolved.<ref name="goto">{{cite journal |author=Goto, T. |title=Comparative Anatomy, Phylogeny and Cladistic Classification of the Order Orectolobiformes (Chondrichthyes, Elasmobranchii) |journal=Memoirs of the Graduate School of Fisheries Science, Hokkaido University |volume=48 |issue=1 |date=2001 |pages=1&ndash;101}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
The range of the epaulette shark extends from the southern coast of [[New Guinea]] to the northern coast of [[Australia]], as far south as [[Sydney]].<ref name="bester">Bester, C.

==Description==
[[Image:Hemiscyllium ocellatum 060417w1.jpg|thumb|left|Epaulette sharks are named for the prominent black spot behind their pectoral fins.]]
The epaulette shark has an elongated body, over half of which is comprised by the slender caudal peduncle. The snout is short and rounded, with the [[nares]] placed almost at the tip along with a pair of tiny [[barbel (anatomy)|barbels]]; there are grooves running from the nares to the mouth. There are 26&ndash;35 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 21&ndash;32 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The teeth are small, with broad bases and triangular cusps. The eyes are oval in shape and elevated, with a large [[spiracle]] below each. The five pairs of [[gill slit]]s are small, with the fourth and fifth very close together.<ref name="compagno"/>

The pectoral and [[pelvic fin]]s are broad and rounded and are thickly muscled. The two similarly-sized [[dorsal fin]]s are placed well back on the body. The [[anal fin]] is low and positioned just in front of the [[caudal fin]]. The caudal fin has only an upper lobe, which contains a prominent ventral notch near the tip and is angled almost horizontally relative to the body. Adult epaulette sharks are beige to brownish above with many widely-spaced brown spots and subtle darker bands. There is a very large black spot ringed in white located behind each pectoral fin; this pair of spots are the origin of this shark's common name. Juveniles have alternating light and dark bands over their body and fins, which break up as they mature.<ref name="bester"/><ref name="ferrari">{{cite book |author=Ferrari, A. and Ferrari, A. |title=Sharks |publisher=FireFly Books |date=2022 |page=119 |isbn=1552096297}}</ref> Epaulette sharks are typically 70&ndash;90 cm (27&ndash;35 in) long; the maximum reported length is 107 cm (42 in).<ref name="fishbase"/><ref name="ferrari"/>

==Biology and ecology==
As an [[adaptation]] for navigating its complex reef environment, the epaulette shark moves by seemingly walking, bending its body from side-to-side and pushing off of the substrate with its paddle-shaped pectoral and pelvic fins. The shark only swims to escape from a threat, and then not very far. The [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] supports of the epaulette shark's paired fins are reduced and separated when compared to other sharks, allowing them to be rotated for use as limbs.<ref name="goto et al">{{cite journal |author=Goto, T., Nishida, K. and Nakaya, K. |title=Internal morphology and function of paired fins in the epaulette shark, ''Hemiscyllium ocellatum'' |journal=Ichthyological Research |volume=46 |issue=3 |date=Sep. 1999 |pages=281&ndash;287}}</ref> The gait of the epaulette shark is [[convergent evolution|convergently]] similar to those of [[tetrapod]]s such as [[salamander]]s, suggesting that the movements needed for walking on land may predate, and facilitated the evolution of, the first terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s.<ref name="martin"/> Epaulette sharks are largely [[nocturnal]] and are most active in low water. They often hide inside or below coral heads, though it is enough for the head to be covered even if the rest of the body is exposed.<ref name="compagno"/> Sometimes they perch in the open on sandy flats or atop reefs facing into the current, a form of orientation known as rheotaxis that may improve [[respiration]] or predator awareness.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Peach, M.B. |title=Rheotaxis by epaulette sharks, ''Hemiscyllium ocellatum'' (Chondrichthyes : Hemiscylliidae), on a coral reef flat |journal=Australian Journal of Zoology |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=407&ndash;414 |date=2002 |doi=10.1071/ZO01081 }}</ref>

The larvae feed on [[blood]] and mostly attach to the skin around the [[cloaca]] and the [[claspers]], though they are also found inside the mouth and on the [[gills]]. These parasites cause little damage and are not believed to adversely affect the health of the shark.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Heupel1, M.R. and Bennett, M.B. |title=The occurrence, distribution and pathology associated with gnathiid isopod larvae infecting the epaulette shark, ''Hemiscyllium ocellatum'' |journal=International Journal for Parasitology |volume=29 |issue=2 |date=Feb. 1, 1999 |pages=321&ndash;330}}</ref> Other parasites of this species include a species of [[myxosporea]]n in the genus ''Kudoa'', which infests the [[skeletal muscle]]s,<ref>{{cite journal |title=A myxosporean parasite (Myxosporea: Multivalvulida) in the skeletal muscle of epaulette sharks, ''Hemiscyllium ocellatum'' (Bonnaterre), from the Great Barrier Reef |author=Heupel, M.R. and Bennett, M.B. |journal=Journal of Fish Diseases |date=1996 |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=189&ndash;191}}</ref> the hemogregarine [[protozoan]] ''Haemogregarina hemiscyllii'', which infects the blood,<ref>{{cite journal |author=McKiernana, J.P., Gruttera, A.S. and Davies, A.J. |title=Reproductive and feeding ecology of parasitic gnathiid isopods of epaulette sharks (''Hemiscyllium ocellatum'') with consideration of their role in the transmission of a haemogregarine |journal=International Journal for Parasitology |volume=35 |issue=1 |date=Jan. 2005 |pages=19&ndash;27}}</ref> the [[ostracod]] ''Sheina orri'', which attaches to the gills,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bennett, M.B., Heupel, M.R., Bennett, S.M. and Parker, A.R. |journal=International Journal for Parasitology |volume=27 |issue=3 |date=Mar. 1997 |pages=275&ndash;281}}</ref> and the [[nematode]] ''Proleptus australis'', which infests the stomach.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Heupel, M.R. and Bennett, M.B. |title=Infection of the epaulette shark, ''Hemiscyllium ocellatum'' (Bonnaterre), by the nematode parasite ''Proleptus australis'' Bayliss (Spirurida: Physalopteridae) |journal=Journal of Fish Diseases |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=407&ndash;414}}</ref>

===Hypoxia tolerance===
[[Image:Hemiscyllium ocellatum beach.jpg|thumb|240px|Epaulette sharks can survive for hours with little oxygen.]]
At night, the shallow reef platforms inhabited by the epaulette shark often become isolated from the ocean by the receding tide. The amount of [[dissolved oxygen]] in the pool can drop 80% or more overnight from the combined respiration of all the organisms within the pool. The epaulette shark has evolved to cope with these hypoxic conditions, being able to survive for over three hours in 5% of the atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> level without losing behavioral responsiveness. In the laboratory, epaulette sharks have survived for an hour without any oxygen at 30<U+00B0> C (86<U+00B0> F), which is also unusual in that most animals capable of tolerating oxygen deprivation do so at low temperatures.<ref name="val et al">{{cite book |title=Fish Physiology |author=Val, A.L., de Almeida-Val, V.M.F. and Randall, D.J. |publisher=Academic Press |date=2005 |isbn=012350445 |pages=584&ndash;588}}</ref>

The physiological responses of the epaulette shark to low oxygen are mediated by the [[nucleoside]] [[adenosine]]. In hypoxic conditions, the heart and ventilation rates drop sharply.<ref name="renshaw et al">{{cite journal |author=Renshaw, G.M.C., Kerrisk, C.B. and Nilsson, G.E. |title=The role of adenosine in the anoxic survival of the epaulette shark, ''Hemiscyllium ocellatum'' |journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part B |volume=131 |date=2002 |pages=133&ndash;141 |doi=10.1016/S1096-4959(01)00484-5 }}</ref> The shark's [[blood pressure]] falls by half as the [[blood vessel]]s dilate to deliver more blood to the brain and heart. Unlike in bony fishes and tetrapods, the blood flow rate remains constant and there is no elevation of blood [[glucose]] levels.<ref name="wise et al">{{cite journal |author=Wise, G., Mulvey, J.M. and Renshaw, G.M.C. |title=Hypoxia tolerance in the epaulette shark (''Hemiscyllium ocellatum'') |journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology Part A: Comparative Experimental Biology |volume=281 |issue=1 |pages=1&ndash;5}}</ref> The brains of sharks only consume a third as much [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] as those of [[teleost]]s.<ref name="val et al"/> The epaulette shark is able to lower this energy demand further by reducing the [[metabolism]] of certain areas of its brain, e.g. keeping the sensory nuclei functional while deactivating the motor nuclei. This allows the shark to supply enough ATP to prevent [[neuron]] death, while still remaining alert to its environment.<ref name="mulveya and renshaw">{{cite journal |author=Mulveya, J.M. and Renshaw, G.M.C. |title=Neuronal oxidative hypometabolism in the brainstem of the epaulette shark (''Hemiscyllium ocellatum'') in response to hypoxic pre-conditioning |journal=Neuroscience Letters |volume=290 |issue=1 |date=Aug. 18, 2000 |pages=1&ndash;4}}</ref>

===Feeding===
The epaulette shark is an opportunistic predator of benthic crustaceans, worms, and small [[bony fish]]es. Off Heron Island, over 90% of the epaulette shark's diet consists of [[polychaete worm]]s and [[crab]]s, with juveniles taking mostly the former and adults mostly the latter. It hunts most actively at dawn and dusk, though feeding can occur at any time during the day.<ref name="martin">Martin, R.A. [http://elasmo-research.org/education/ecology/intertidal-epaulette.htm Intertidal Zone: Epaulette Shark]. ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research. Retrieved on May 14, 2009.</ref> This shark relies mainly on its [[olfaction|olfactory]] and [[electroception|electroreceptive]] senses to locate hidden prey.<ref name="compagno"/> It is capable of sucking prey into its mouth by expanding its muscular [[buccal cavity]].<ref name="martin"/> While searching for food, the epaulette shark sometimes turns over debris with its snout or thrusts its head into the sand, swallowing food items while expelling the sand grains through its gill slits.<ref name="compagno"/> Unlike most sharks, the epaulette shark may [[mastication|chew]] its food for up to 5&ndash;10 minutes.<ref name="martin"/> Its teeth can be depressed to form a flat surface for crushing hard-shelled prey.<ref name="bester"/>

===Life history===
[[Mating]] in the epaulette shark takes place from July to December, though in captivity reproduction occurs continuously.<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="heupel et al">{{cite journal |author=Heupel, M.R., Whittier, J.M. and Bennett, M.B. |title=Plasma steroid hormone profiles and reproductive biology of the epaulette shark, ''Hemiscyllium ocellatum'' |journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology Part A: Comparative Experimental Biology |volume=284 |issue=5 |pages=586&ndash;594 |date=1999}}</ref> Courtship may be initiated by the female following and biting the male.

The female drops the egg capsules two (rarely four) at a time every 14 days, producing a total of 20&ndash;50 eggs per year. Each egg case measures 10 cm (3.9 in) long and 4 cm (1.6 in) wide. The young emerge after 120&ndash;130 days, at a length of 14&ndash;16 cm (5.5&ndash;6.3 in). The growth rate of the young is slow at first but increases to about 5 cm (2 in) per year after three months. Both males and females [[sexual maturation|mature sexually]] at a length of 54&ndash;64 cm (21&ndash;25 in), corresponding to an age of at least seven years.<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="martin"/>

==Human interactions==
Epaulette sharks are harmless to humans, though if handled they may nip their captors. They are easily captured by beachgoers as they move slowly and show little fear of humans; the shark is often injured by these encounters. This species adapts readily to captivity and is displayed by many [[public aquariums]] in the United States, Canada, and Australia.<ref name="compagno"/> In an article for ''Aquarium Fish Magazine'', Scott W. Michael referred to the epaulette shark as "the best shark for the home aquarium." They will breed in captivity, even in tanks as small as 510 L (135 gal), though full-grown sharks are best housed in tanks of 680 L (180 gal) or more. They are not compatible with community tanks as they will eat other fish.<ref name="michael">{{citation |last=Michael |first=S.W. |title=Sharks at Home |newspaper=Aquarium Fish Magazine |pages=20&ndash;29 |date=2004 |volume=March 2004}}</ref>

The [[World Conservation Union]] has assessed the epaulette shark as of [[Least Concern]]. This species is common in Australian waters, where it is not captured by either [[commercial fishing|commercial]] or [[recreational fishing|recreational fisheries]], and is minimally affected by collection for the aquarium trade and fishery [[bycatch]]. Much of its Australian habitat is encompassed by protected marine parks. Off New Guinea, the epaulette shark has been assessed as [[Near Threatened]], as there it faces [[habitat degradation]], destructive fishing practices, and [[overfishing|over-exploitation]] by [[artisanal fishing|artisan fishers]].<ref name="iucn"/>
