Fellow students described Cho as a "quiet" person who "would not respond if someone greeted him." Student Julie Poole recalled the first day of a literature class the previous year when the students introduced themselves one by one. When it was Cho's turn to introduce himself, he did not speak. According to Poole, the professor looked at the sign-in sheet and found that, whereas everyone else wrote out their names, Cho wrote only a question mark.

Virginia Special Justice Paul Barnett certified in an order that Cho "[presented] an imminent danger to himself as a result of mental illness," but instead recommended treatment for Cho as an outpatient.

He's been thinking about this for several months prior to the shooting."<ref name=firstgun/>

====Review of Cho's medical records====
During the investigation, the matter of Cho's court-ordered mental health treatment was also examined to determine its outcome. Virginia investigators learned after a review of Cho's medical records that Cho never complied with the order for the mandated mental health treatment as an outpatient.<ref name="mhealthExam"/> The investigators also found that neither the court nor New River Valley Community Services Board exercised oversight of Cho's case to determine his compliance with the order for outpatient treatment. In response to questions about Cho's case, New River Valley Community Services Board maintained that its facility was never named in the court order as the provider for Cho's mental health treatment, and its responsibility ended once Cho was discharged from its care after the court order.<ref name="mhealthExam"/> In addition, Christopher Flynn, director of the Cook Counseling Center at Virginia Tech, mentioned that the court did not notify his office to report that Cho was required to seek outpatient mental health treatment. Flynn added that, "When a court gives a mandatory order that someone get outpatient treatment, that order is to the individual, not an agency ... The one responsible for ensuring that the mentally ill person receives help in these sort of cases ... is the mentally ill person."<ref name="mhealthExam"/> 

As a result, Cho escaped compliance with the court order for mandatory mental health treatment as an outpatient, even though Virginia law required community services boards to "recommend a specific course of treatment and programs" for mental health patients and "monitor the person's compliance."<ref name="mhealthExam"/> As for the court, Virgina law also mandated that, if a person fails to comply with a court order to seek mental health treatment as an outpatient, that person can be brought back before the court "and if found still in crisis, can be committed to a psychiatric institution for up to 180 days." Cho was never summoned to court to explain why he had not complied with the [[December 14]] [[2005]] order for mandatory mental health treatment as an outpatient.<ref name="mhealthExam"/>

====Appointment of investigative panel====
In the aftermath of the killing spree, Virginia Governor [[Timothy Kaine]] appointed a panel to investigate the campus shootings, with plans for the panel to submit a report of its findings in approximately two to three months. Governor Kaine also invited former Homeland Security Secretary [[Tom Ridge]] to join the panel to "review Cho<U+2019>s mental health history and how police responded to the tragedy."<ref name="mental health investigation">Ferguson, B.

====Release of material====
Upon receiving the package on [[April 18]] [[2007]], NBC contacted authorities and made the controversial decision to publicize Cho's communications by releasing a small fraction of what it received.<ref>Perez-Pena, R. ([[April 21]] [[2007]]). [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/21/us/21backlash.html Media outlets ease off video killer, but not because of complaints, they say.] ''The New York Times''. Retrieved on [[May 10]] [[2007]].</ref> After pictures and images from the videos were broadcasted in numerous news reports, students and faculty from Virginia Tech, along with relatives of victims of the campus shooting, expressed concerns that glorifying Cho's rampage could lead to copycat killings. The airing of the manifesto and its video images and pictures were especially upsetting to those persons affected by the shootings. Peter Read, the father of Mary Read, one of the students who was killed by Cho during the rampage, asked the media to stop airing Cho's manifesto.<ref>{{cite news | title='Killer's images 'a second assault on us'' | url =http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/04/19/vtech.shooting/index.html | publisher=CNN | date=[[2007-04-20]] | accessdate = 2007-04-20}}</ref> 

Police officials, who reviewed the video, pictures and Cho's manifesto, concluded that the contents of the media package had marginal value in helping them learn and understand why Cho committed the killings.<ref>Macklin, W.

==Writings==
===Plays===
In 2006, Cho wrote a short, profanity-laden one-act play entitled "'''Richard McBeef'''" in connection with a class assignment. The play focused on John, a 13-year-old boy whose father reportedly died in a boating accident, and Richard McBeef, John's stepfather and ex-football player. When Richard touches John during an attempt at a father-to-son talk, the boy abruptly claims that his stepfather is [[child sexual abuse|molesting]] him. John then accuses his stepfather Richard of murdering his father and repeatedly says that he will kill Richard. John, Richard and Sue (John's mother) are embroiled suddenly in a major argument. Richard retreats to his car to escape the conflict, but John, despite claiming repeatedly that Richard was abusing him, joins his stepfather in the car and harasses him. The play ends with John trying to shove a banana-flavored cereal bar into his stepfather's throat and Richard, hitherto a passive character, reacting "out of sheer desecrated hurt and anger" by "swinging a deadly blow" at the boy.<ref>Cho Seung-Hui.

In a second play, "'''Mr. Brownstone'''," written by Cho for another class assignment, three 17-year-olds (John, Jane and Joe) sit in a [[casino]] while discussing their deep hatred for Mr. Brownstone, their 45-year-old mathematics teacher. The three characters claim that Mr. Brownstone mistreats them (using the phrase "ass-rape"). John wins a multi-million-dollar jackpot from one of the slot machines and Mr. Brownstone, amid volleys of profanity, reports to casino officials that the three characters were underage and had picked up the winning ticket. Mr. Brownstone tells the casino officials that he had won the jackpot and that the minors took it from him.<ref name="AOL-Brownstone">Cho Seung-Hui.

===Reactions to writings===
[[Edward Falco]], a playwriting professor at Virginia Tech, has acknowledged that Cho wrote both plays in his class.  The plays are less than 12 pages long and have several grammatical and typographical errors. Falco believed that Cho was drawn to writing because of his difficulty communicating orally.  Falco said of the plays, "They're not good writing, but at least they are a form of communication."<ref>{{cite news | first=Jonathan | last=Mandell | title='Cho's Professor to Classmates: Don't Feel Guilty"|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/04/18/vatech.professor/index.html | publisher=CNN | date=[[2007-04-18]] | accessdate = 2007-04-18}}</ref> Another professor who taught Cho characterized his work as "very adolescent" and "silly", with attempts at "[[Slapstick|slapstick comedy]]" and "elements of violence."<ref>{{cite news | first=Wingert | last=Pat | coauthors=Lynn Waddell and Arian Campo-Flores | title='He Was Just Off' | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18161472/site/newsweek/ | publisher=Newsweek | date=[[2007-04-17]] | accessdate = 2007-04-17}}</ref>

[[Novelist]] [[Stephen King]] examined Cho's plays and wrote an essay for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.  The essay read, in part:

{{cquote|For most creative people, the imagination serves as an excretory channel for violence: We visualize what we will never actually do ([[James Patterson]], for instance, a nice man who has all too often worked the street that my old friend George used to work). Cho doesn't strike me as in the least creative, however. Dude was crazy. Dude was, in the memorable phrasing of Nikki Giovanni, ''just mean.'' Essentially there's no story here, except for a paranoid a--hole who went [[DEFCON|DEFCON-1]]. He may have been inspired by Columbine, but only because he was too dim to think up such a scenario on his own.
