"'''You da One'''" is a song by [[Barbadian people|Barbadian]] recording artist [[Rihanna]] for her sixth studio album ''[[Talk That Talk]]'' (2011). It was co-written by Rihanna with [[Ester Dean]], Henry Walter, [[John Hill (producer)|John Hill]] and Lukasz Gottwald. Production of the song was completed by Gottwald, under his production name [[Dr. Luke]], and Cirkut. Kuk Harrell and Marcas Tovar recorded the track at the Sofital Paris Le Laubourg, Room 538, and [[Westlake Recording Studios]] in Los Angeles, California. It premiered on US radio on on November 11, 2011, and was made available to [[Music download|download digitally]] throughout Europe and Australasia on November 14, 2011. It was added to US Mainstream, rhythmic and urban radio station playlists on November 29, 2011. Throughout December 2011 and January 2012, a remix [[extended play]] (EP) was released worldwide. 

Musically, "You da One" is a [[Tempo|mid-tempo]] [[Pop music|pop]] and [[synthpop#21st century revival|electropop]] song, which incorporates elements of [[dancehall]] and [[reggae]]. It also features a [[dubstep]] [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] before the final chorus. It garnered positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], many of whom complimented the West Indian and Caribbean tone, and compared it to "[[What's My Name? (Rihanna song)|What's My Name?]]" and "[[Man Down]]", from her previous studio album ''[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]'' (2010). The song achieved moderate chart success; it peaked at number one on the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] and number 14 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Internationally, it peaked inside the top 10 in New Zealand, South Korea and on the [[UK R&B Chart]], and attained top twenty positions in Canada, Hungary, Norway and Sweden.

To promote the song, an accompanying [[music video]] was shot in [[East (London sub region)|East London]] and directed by [[Melina Matsoukas]]. It was inspired by the 1971 film ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', and premiered on December 23, 2011. It was mainly shot in black and white, and features Rihanna in a variety of different set ups, such as in a photo shoot and a lyric video game. At various points, lyrics are stamped across the video as Rihanna sings them. Hours after the release of the video, Norwegian photographer Solve Sundsbo accused Rihanna and Matsoukas of plagiarism, suggesting that the scene featuring the singer wearing a white outfit with black dots was deliberately copied from his 2008 montage "Numero 93".

===Background and synopsis===
The music video for "You da One" was filmed on November 26 and 27, 2011 at MC Motors in Dalston, [[East (London sub region)|East London]].<ref name="Video Location">{{cite web|last=Gibson|first=Tom|title=Music Video Location|url=http://www.castlegibson.com/2012/01/rihanna-you-da-one/|publisher=Castle Gibson|accessdate=24 January, 2012}}</ref> It was directed by [[Melina Matsoukas]], who also directed the controversial [[We Found Love (video)|video]] for her previous single, "[[We Found Love]]".<ref name="Director">{{cite web|title=Rihanna gets fanged grill for You Da One video|url=http://www.mtvasia.com/news/rihanna-gets-fanged-grill-for-you-da-one-video|work=''[[MTV]] Asia''|publisher=[[Viacom]]|date=24 February, 2012|accessdate=17 July, 2012}}</ref> In the first images from the London set, Rihanna sported short blonde hair, torn denim shorts, patterned leggings, and a white bowler hat. She held a black cane as she performed scenes in front of a bright pink wall in the visuals inspired by the 1971 film ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2011/11/30/rihanna-goes-blonde-in-you-da-one- video/|title=Rihanna Goes Blonde in 'You Da One' Video|work=''Rap-Up''|publisher=Devin Lazerine|accessdate=17 July, 2012}}</ref> It premiered on December 23, 2011.<ref name="billboard">{{cite web|last=Lipshutz|first=Jason|url=http://www.billboard.com/column/viralvideos/rihanna-s-you-da-one-video-giant-balls-and-1005728352.story#/column/viralvideos/rihanna-s-you-da-one-video-giant-balls-and-1005728352.story|title=Rihanna's 'You Da One' Video: Giant Balls and Bowler Hats|work=Billboard|accessdate=18 December 2011}}</ref> 

The clip is partly a photo shoot and a lyric video as lyrics are stamped across the screen and Rihanna's body, and was shot mainly in black and white.<ref name="con">{{cite web|last=Young|first=Alex|title=Video: Rihanna <U+2013> "You Da One"|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2011/12/video-rihanna-you-da-one/|publisher=Consequence of Sound|accessdate=18 December 2011}}</ref> She wears numerous outfits and blonde wigs throughout the video as she emulates the clothes from ''A Clockwork Orange'' by wearing a white bowler hat and cane from Laird Hatters, sporting a smoky eye in homage, and smacking her pink pouty lips with [[bubblegum]].<ref name=daily>{{cite news|last=Mendoza|first=Nadia|title=Rihanna does a Britney!

Several scenes capture solely her mouth; first with a gold grill covering her bottom row of teeth, and later with smoke billowing from her lips transitioning into and out of the words "Dream" and later "You Da One".<ref name="IdolatorVid">{{cite web|url=http://idolator.com/6121262/rihannas-you-da-one-video-is-aces|title=Rihanna Is Aces In Her 'You Da One' Video|work=''[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]''|publisher=[[Buzz Media]]|accessdate=18 December 2011}}</ref> Another scene finds Rihanna in a white tank top and tattered jean shorts, swinging a cane in between two brick buildings. She continuously exudes sexuality; in several scenes, she touches and thrusts her crotch (reminiscent of [[Michael Jackson]]'s dance moves, as noted by Jason Lipshutz of ''Billboard''),<ref name="billboard"/> struts toward the camera with a pimp cane, endorses provocative dance moves,<ref name=aol/> and drapes herself over a giant ball. Using the latter move, she is found in a black and white chequered background room where she moves around a larger than life [[playing card]]. The video ends with Rihanna running away from the camera and jumping into a chair, throwing her legs over the side with a smile on her face.

===Reception and allagations===
A reviewer for [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] described the video as "glorious."<ref name="IdolatorVid"/> Amy Sciarretto for PopCrush wrote "Judging from the song's official video, it is, since RiRi can<U+2019>t keep her hands to herself. The black and white video features the newly blond singer cavorting in an array of black and white outfits, dancing, smiling, giggling and grabbing her crotch with a great degree of regularity."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popcrush.com/rihanna-you-da-one-video/|title=Rihanna goes blonde and touches herself (a lot) in 'You da One' video|publisher=PopCrush|accessdate=17 July, 2012}}</ref> Hours after the release of the video, Norwegian photographer Solve Sundsbo alleged that the scene of Rihanna wearing a white outfit with black dots shining on her ''(pictured)'' is the same as a photo shoot he completed in 2008 titled "Numero 93'".<ref name="IdolatorVid1">{{cite web|url=http://idolator.com/6121562/did-rihannas-you-da-one-video-plagiarize-another-photographer|title=Did Rihanna's 'You Da One' Music Video Plagiarize Another Photographer?|work=''Idolator''|publisher=Buzz Media|accessdate=December 23 2011}}</ref> A reviewer for Idolator wrote that "the evidence really doesn<U+2019>t look to be in Rihanna's favor."<ref name="IdolatorVid1"/> The reviewer continued to write "Not only are the projected shapes similar, but both Rihanna and the model are wearing nearly-identical body suits and wigs (though the color differs). Plus, those pink lips providing the only splash of color also look pretty familiar."<ref name="IdolatorVid1"/> A reviewer for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' concurred with Idolator's observations, and noted  "The nakedness, the projections, the interplay of light and shadow... even the haircut" were very similar to that of the the work by Sundsbo.<ref>{{cite news|first=Priscilla|last=Frank|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/23/does-rihannas-you-da-one-_n_1168069.html|title=Watch: Rihanna's New Video Rips Off Famous Photographer...
