{{quote|What I really had in mind was a journey of discovery into the unknown. Although I felt there were excellent interpretations of baroque music performed on modern instruments, I sensed that we'd come to the end of the road - and yet I knew that there were still discoveries to be made. I was thinking about the interesting experiments made by [[Nikolaus Harnoncourt]] and Gustav Leonhardt, although I knew we'd have to experiment in our own way. It was a huge challenge; playing period instruments wasn't as easy as it is today, and finding out their secrets was a difficult process. Nowadays an extraordinarily high technical level has been achieved and the upcoming generations don't have any of the problems we pioneers faced. We cleared the way.}}

Trevor Pinnock was at the forefront of the period performance movement and the revitalisation of the baroque repertoire; the reaction of [[Leonard Bernstein]] to his performances is typical: "In my opinion, the work of the conductor Trevor Pinnock in this area is particularly exciting - his performances of Bach and Handel make me jump out of my seat!"<ref>{{Citation

In 2004 he commissioned [[contemporary classical music|modern]] harpsichord music by English composer [[John Webb (composer)|John Webb]]: ''Surge'' (2004), "is built up over an implacable rhythmic repeat-figure. Though neither is explicitly tonal, each skilfully avoids the merely percussive effect that the harpsichord's complex overtones can all too easily impart to more densely dissonant music." He has also played the same composer's ''Ebb'' (2000), which "comprises a spasmodic discourse against a manic background of descending scale patterns like a kind of out-of-kilter change-ringing."<ref>Quotes from: {{cite web
