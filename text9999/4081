A '''Fluffernutter''' is a [[sandwich]] made with [[peanut butter]] and [[marshmallow creme]], usually served on [[white bread]]. Variations of the sandwich include the substitution of [[whole grain|wheat bread]] and the addition of various sweet, salty and [[Umami|savory]] ingredients. The term ''fluffernutter'' can also be used to describe other food items, primarily desserts, that incorporate peanut butter and marshmallow creme.

The sandwich was first created in the early 20th century after marshmallow creme, a sweet [[marshmallow]]-like [[Spread (food)|spread]], was invented in the U.S. state of [[Massachusetts]]. [[Archibald Query]] of [[Somerville, Massachusetts]], invented a product he called Marshmallow Creme in 1917, and Emma and Amory Curtis of [[Melrose, Massachusetts]], invented Snowflake Marshmallow Creme in 1913. During World War I, Emma Curtis published a recipe for a peanut butter and marshmallow creme sandwich, which is the earliest known example of a Fluffernutter. Meanwhile, Query sold his recipe to Durkee-Mower Inc., who renamed it Marshmallow Fluff and continues to sell it under that name today. The term ''Fluffernutter'' was created in 1960 by an advertising agency hired by Durkee-Mower to find a more effective way to market the peanut butter and marshmallow sandwich.

The sandwich is particularly popular in [[New England]] and has been proposed as the official state sandwich of Massachusetts. However, it has also sparked controversy because of its nutrition content and its possible contribution to [[childhood obesity]].

==History==
Marshmallow creme, one of the two main ingredients of a Fluffernutter, was invented in the early 20th century. [[Archibald Query]] invented a creation he called Marshmallow Creme in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]], in 1917, while Amory and Emma Curtis of [[Melrose, Massachusetts]], invented Snowflake Marshmallow Creme in 1913. During World War I, Emma Curtis published a recipe for the ''Liberty Sandwich'', which consisted of peanut butter and Snowflake Marshmallow Creme on oat or barley bread.<ref name=lexicon/> The recipe was published in a promotional booklet sent to Curtis' customers in 1918 and may be the origin of the Fluffernutter sandwich.<ref name=melrose/> Earlier labels and booklets published by the Curtises suggested combining Snow Flake Marshmallow Creme with peanut butter or eating it on sandwiches with chopped nuts or olives.<ref name=melrose>{{cite web|last=Alverson|first=Brigid|title=Fluff?

Meanwhile, sugar shortages during World War I hurt sales of Archibald Query's Marshmallow Creme, so Query sold his recipe in 1920 to two men from [[Swampscott, Massachusetts]], H. Allen Durkee and Fred L. Mower, who began distributing the product through their company, Durkee-Mower Inc. The pair renamed the product Toot Sweet Marshmallow Fluff, and Durkee-Mower continues to sell the product under the name Marshmallow Fluff.<ref name=mit>{{cite web|title=Inventor of the Week: Archibald Query|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/query.html|work=Lemelson-MIT|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]|accessdate=7 March 2012}}</ref> The sandwich made with peanut butter and marshmallow creme continued to be eaten, but was not called a Fluffernutter until 1960, when an advertising firm Durkee-Mower hired created the term as a more effective way to market the sandwich.<ref name=mit/><ref name=lexicon>{{cite book|last=Stern|first=Jane|title=The Lexicon of Real American Food|year=2011|publisher=Lyons press|pages=110|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mHBVnMl3nMkC&pg=PT116&dq=fluffernutter&hl=en&sa=X&ei=z4ROT9j9CNTCsQKzzYEB&ved=0CGIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=fluffernutter&f=false}}</ref> ''Fluffernutter'' is a registered trademark of Durkee-Mower, although the company's U.S. trademark registrations for the term cover only ice cream and printed recipes. In 2006, Durkee-Mower sued [[Williams Sonoma|Williams-Sonoma Inc.]] in the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts]], alleging that Williams-Sonoma infringed on its trademark by selling a marshmallow and peanut butter chocolate-covered candy under the ''Fluffernutter'' name.<ref>{{cite news |title= Williams-Sonoma sued over 'Fluffernutter' |author= |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11728918/ |publisher= [[msnbc.com]] |date= March 8, 2006 |accessdate= September 14, 2011}}</ref>

In June 2006, Massachusetts State Senator [[Jarrett Barrios]] gained national attention when he proposed legislation restricting the serving of Fluffernutter sandwiches in public schools. After Barrios learned that his son was served Fluffernutters on a daily basis at his [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], public elementary school, he created an amendment to a junk food bill that aimed to limit the serving of Fluffernutters in Massachusetts public schools to once a week.<ref name=spread/><ref name=fox>{{cite news|last=LeBlanc|first=Steve|title=Fluffernutter Sandwich Angers Mass.

==In culture==
The term ''fluffernutter'' has sometimes been used disparagingly to describe something that lacks substance and has minimal to no cultural value.<ref>{{cite news|title=Top Picks: 4th of July on PBS, letters to Harry Potter, jazz masters, and more; PBS presents their annual "A Capitol Fourth" concert, Harry Potter's fan mail, Sony celebrates 40 years of jazz, and more recommendations.|accessdate=2 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=30 June 2011}}</ref><ref name=AdAge>{{cite web|last=Louderback|first=Jim|title=There, I Said It: Screw Viral Videos|url=http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/constant-focus-viral-videos-good-ad-industry/145636/|publisher=[[Ad Age]]|accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref> On the other hand, some writers look on Fluffernutters and marshmallow creme as a source of childhood nostalgia and regional pride.<ref name=spread/><ref>{{cite news|title=State Senator Wants Fluff Off School Menus|url=http://www.thebostonchannel.com/r/9394199/detail.html|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=TheBostonChannel.com|date=19 June 2006}}</ref>

The sandwich has close ties to New England, particularly to Somerville, Massachusetts, where Archibald Query invented Marshmallow Fluff, and to Lynn, Massachusetts, where Durkee-Mower has produced it for decades.<ref name = statesandwich/> Somerville holds an annual festival called What the Fluff? based around celebrating Mashmallow Fluff and Fluffernutter sandwiches. The festival incorporates music, visual art, games and a cooking contest based around Fluff and Fluffernutters. In 2011, [[NASA]] astronaut [[Richard Michael Linnehan]], who was born in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], and ate a Fluffernutter while aboard the [[International Space Station]], acted as one of the contest judges.<ref name=somerville>{{cite news|last=Twardzik|first=Cathleen|title=It<U+2019>s <U+2018>What the Fluff?<U+2019> time again in Somerville|url=http://www.thesomervillenews.com/archives/19137|accessdate=4 March 2012|newspaper=The Somerville News|date=22 September 2011}}</ref>

[[Cyril O'Reilly (Oz)|Cyril O'Reilly]] chooses a fluffernutter as his [[last meal]] before his [[Capital punishment|execution]] in the sixth episode of the sixth season of the [[HBO]] series [[Oz (TV series)|OZ]].

In Season 3, Episode 13 of the popular sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond, titled 'Ping pong', the shows main character Raymond alludes to the eating of a fluffernutter sandwich before competing with his father in a game of table tennis.
