'''''The Land of Green Plums''''' ({{lang-de|Herztier}}) is a novel by [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]]-winning author [[Herta M<U+00FC>ller]], published in 1994 by [[Rowohlt Verlag]]. Perhaps M<U+00FC>ller's best-known work,<ref>{{cite news|last=Kurczy|first=Stephen|title=Mario Vargas Llosa wins 2010 Nobel Prize for Literature. Who else won in the past decade?|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-Issues/2010/1007/Mario-Vargas-Llosa-wins-2010-Nobel-Prize-for-Literature.-Who-else-won-in-the-past-decade/2009-Herta-Mueller|accessdate=9 December 2010|newspaper=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|year=2010}}</ref> the story portrays four young people living in a [[totalitarian]] police state under the Soviet-imposed [[Communist Romania|communist dictatorship in Romania]], ending with their emigration to Germany. The narrator is an unidentified young woman belonging to the [[Germans of Romania|German minority]], much like the author herself. M<U+00FC>ller said the novel was written "in memory of my Romanian friends who were killed under the Ceau<U+015F>escu regime".<ref name="flood">{{Cite news   | last = Flood  | first = Alison  | title = Herta M<U+00FC>ller takes Nobel prize for literature  | newspaper = [[The Guardian]]  | date = 8 October 2009 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/oct/08/herta-muller-nobel-prize-literature  | accessdate = 27 January 2010}}</ref>

Like many of M<U+00FC>ller's books, ''The Land of Green Plums'' illustrates the position of dissidents from the German minority in Romania, who suffered a double oppression under the regime of [[Nicolae Ceau<U+015F>escu]]. The rural [[German language|German-speaking]] community tries to preserve its culture by strictly enforcing traditional rules; once the main characters escape this environment through university study in the city, they suffer, as political dissidents, the oppression exercised by the totalitarian regime. Those who flee the country for Germany find themselves cultural outcasts: they are not considered German but rather Eastern Europeans. Critics read the novel as giving testimony of abuse and the ensuing trauma. Normal human relationships are rendered impossible by the lack of freedom of expression; the threat of violence, imprisonment, and execution; and the possibility that any personal friend may be a traitor. Written in a [[Parataxis|paratactic]] style, full of flashbacks and time shifts, the very language of the book reflects trauma and political oppression.

After its publication in [[German language|German]] and its translation into [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the novel received moderate attention, but it gained an international audience when the English translation by [[Michael Hofmann]] was published in 1996. In 1998 this translation won the prestigious [[International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award]], the largest prize given for a single work of fiction published in English.<ref>{{Cite web  | title = The International IMPAC DUBLIN Literary Award 1998  | publisher = IMPAC Dublin  | url = http://www.impacdublinaward.ie/1998.htm | accessdate = 27 January 2010}}</ref> Following the announcement of the 2009 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] for Herta M<U+00FC>ller, ''The Land of Green Plums'' entered the bestseller list on [[Amazon.com]].<ref>{{Cite web  | last1 = Kjetland  | first1 = Ragnhild  | last2=Bensinger |first2=Greg  | title = Amazon.com Says Mueller Books Saw 'Hugely Increased' Demand |publisher=Bloomberg.com  | date = 8 October 2009| url = http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=am1ioGFxxi3I  | accessdate = 27 January 2010}}</ref>

==Plot==
The first character introduced to the reader is a young girl named Lola, who shares a room with five other girls, including the narrator, in a college dormitory. Lola records her experiences in a diary, relating her efforts to escape from the totalitarian world of school and society by riding the buses at night and having brutish, anonymous sex with men returning home from factory work. She also has an affair with the gym teacher, and soon joins the Communist Party. This first part of the book ends when Lola is found hanging in the closet; she has left her diary in the narrator's suitcase.

Having supposedly committed suicide and thus betrayed her country and her party, Lola is publicly denounced in a school ceremony. Soon after, the narrator shares Lola's diary with three male friends, Edgar, Georg, and Kurt; Lola's life becomes an escape for them as they attend college and engage in mildly subversive activities--"harbouring unsuitable German books, humming scraps of banned songs, writing to one another in crude code, taking photographs of the blacked-out buses which carry prisoners between the prison and the construction sites."<ref name="enright"/> The four are from German-speaking communities; all receive mail from their mothers complaining about their various illnesses and how their children's [[wikt:subversive|subversiveness]] is causing them trouble; all have fathers who were members of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] during World War II. They hide the diary and other documents, including photographs and books,<ref name="enright">{{Cite news   | last = Enright  | first = D.J.  | title = Rev. of ''The Land of Green Plums''  | newspaper = [[Times Literary Supplement]]  | date = 17 July 1998| url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article6870809.ece?print=yes&randnum=1151003209000  | accessdate = 27 January 2010}}</ref> in the well of a deserted summerhouse in town. Very quickly it becomes clear that an officer of the [[Securitate]], Captain Pjele, is interested in the four and begins to subject them to regular interrogations. Their possessions are searched, their mail opened, and they are threatened by the captain and his dog.

After graduation the four go their separate ways, but they remain in contact through letters and regular visits, although their letters are read by the Securitate. They take menial jobs: Kurt works in a slaughterhouse as a supervisor, for instance, and the narrator translates German manuals in a factory. A fifth member, Tereza, befriends the narrator even as it becomes clear that she is acting partly on Pjele's orders.

The lives of all five become more miserable, and each conforms to the regime's demands even as they lose their jobs for apparently political reasons. They  discuss fleeing the country, and Georg is the first to do so; weeks after he arrives in Germany, he commits suicide by jumping out the window of a [[Frankfurt]] hotel. The narrator and Edgar likewise acquire passports and go to Germany, still receiving death threats. Kurt remains in Romania, no longer working, and later found hanged. The novel ends with the same passage as it began: "When we don't speak, said Edgar, we become unbearable, and when we do, we make fools of ourselves".<ref name="enright"/>

==Characters==
The narrator, Edgar, Georg, and Kurt hail from similar backgrounds. All are German Romanian and students at the same university. They all suffer persecution, and oppose the regime.<ref name="glajar"/> The characters<U+2014>especially Edgar, Georg, and Kurt<U+2014>are quite deliberately not developed in great detail, as noted by critics. "Characterization is not the point here. M<U+00FC>ller is primarily a poet", and this poetic interest likewise is said to explain the lack of chapter organization and of transitional phrases.<ref>{{Cite web  | last = DiMartino  | first = Nick  | title = Book Review: ''The Land of Green Plums''  | publisher = Shelf Awareness  | date = 30 November 2009| url = http://news.shelf-awareness.com/ar/theshelf/2009-11-30/book_review_the_land_of_green_plums.html  | accessdate = 27 January 2010}}</ref> Only two of the six main characters who suffer oppression survive: Lola dies by hanging, Georg commits suicide after fleeing to Germany, Kurt is found hanged, and Tereza, the narrator's friend who betrays her to the Securitate, dies of cancer.<ref name="eddy"/>

===Autobiography===
The novel is partly autobiographical. Like her narrator, M<U+00FC>ller comes from the German-speaking minority in Romania, the [[Banat Swabians]], with a former SS man for a father. Trained as a teacher, she lost her position after refusing to cooperate with the Securitate, and left for Germany in 1987.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last = Talmor  | first = Sascha  | title = The cruel sons of Cain: Herta M<U+00FC>lller's the land of green plums  | journal = [[The European Legacy]]  | volume = 4  | issue = 5  | pages = 88<U+2013>97  | date = October 1999  | url = http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a794383350&db=all  | doi = 10.1080}}</ref> In a 1998 interview she mentioned that real persons can be recognized in some of her characters, including one in ''The Land of Green Plums'': "That [recognition of characters] was already the case in my previous book [''The Land of the Green Plums''].

She was in the service of the Securitate, as it turned out. She had left her passport lying out, and I saw it by chance one morning, when she was out. No ordinary person had such a passport with visas to Greece, to Italy, and Spain. She confessed everything, and shortly after I naturally had to throw her out. This happened in the same period that I was receiving death threats like many others who had fled from Romania, and I kept far away from Romanians I did not know or could not count on. But she was my friend.<ref name="eddy"/>}}

The novel approaches [[allegory]]<ref name="rich">{{Cite news   | last = Rich  | first = Motoki  | coauthors = Nicholas Kulish  | title = Herta M<U+00FC>ller Wins Nobel Prize in Literature  | newspaper = [[New York Times]]  | date = 8 October 2009| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/books/09nobel.html?bl  | accessdate = 27 January 2010}}</ref> in many of its details, such as the green plums of the title. Mothers warn their children not to eat green, unripe plums, claiming that they are poisonous. Yet the novel regularly depicts police officers gorging themselves on the fruit: "The officers' lack of constraint in engulfing the fruit parallels the remorseless persecution of the human race" under [[Nicolae Ceau<U+015F>escu]].<ref>{{Cite news   | last = Frosch  | first = Kristin  | title = In review: The Land of Green Plums.

'They reverted to childhood, stealing plums from village trees.' Ms. Muller's vision of a police state manned by plum thieves reads like a kind of fairy tale on the mingled evils of gluttony, stupidity and brutality."<ref name="wolff"/>


==Language and style==
Critics have recognized M<U+00FC>ller's writing as political, "as a form of manifest resistance against totalitarian claims to power," and have studied her "complex and ambiguous imagery."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bauer|first=Karin|title=Rev. of Ralph K<U+00F6>hnen, ed., ''Der Druck der Erfahrung treibt die Sprache in die Dichtung: Bildlickeit in Texten Herta M<U+00FC>llers''.|journal=[[The German Quarterly]]|year=1999|volume=72|issue=4|pages=421<U+2013>22}}</ref> According to Larry Wolff, reviewing the book for ''[[The New York Times]]'', the poetic quality of the language is essentially connected to its author's objective: "the author seeks to create a sort of poetry out of the spiritual and material ugliness of life in Communist Romania."<ref name="wolff">{{Cite news   | last = Wolff  | first = Larry  | title = Strangers in a Strange Land   | newspaper = [[The New York Times]]  | date = 1 December 1996 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/11/29/nnp/muller-plums.html  | accessdate = 27 January 2010}}</ref> Critics have generally shown appreciation for the novel's language, as did Nicholas Lezard, writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'': <blockquote>The prose, while simple at the level of the sentence (and we can safely assume that Hofmann's translation is very faithful to the original), is shifty, blurred, to the point where at times we are left unsure as to what exactly is going on <U+2013> a deliberate flight from causation, quite understandable in a country where everyone (even, we learn, the horses) has been driven mad by fear.<ref>{{Cite news   | last = Lezard  | first = Nicholas  | title = ''The Land of Green Plums'' by Herta M<U+00FC>ller: Nicholas Lezard's choice  | newspaper = [[The Guardian]]  | date = 14 November 2009 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/nov/14/land-green-plums-lezard-review  | accessdate = 27 January 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

Though the novel's language, and M<U+00FC>ller's language in general, is praised for its precision--[[Peter Englund]], secretary of the [[Swedish Academy]], noted her "extreme precision with words"<ref name="flood"/><U+2014>many things are left unsaid. As a reviewer for ''[[The Australian]]'' noted, the narrator is never named, the words "totalitarian" and "liberty" never appear in the book, and even Ceausescu, usually referred to as the "dictator," is named only twice, first when one of the characters (a Jewish WWII survivor) notes how the greeting "ciao" is also the first syllable of the dictator's name and again when a comparison is made between Ceausescu, Hitler, and Stalin.<ref>{{Cite book  | last = M<U+00FC>ller  | first = Herta  | authorlink = Herta M<U+00FC>ller  | coauthors = Michael Hofmann (tr.)  | title = The Land of Green Plums  | publisher = Northwestern University Press  | year = 1998  | pages = 134, 174  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=EID4smWDEIgC&pg=PA134&lpg=PA134  | isbn = 9780810115972}}</ref>

==Themes==
===Trauma===
[[Psychological trauma]] caused by fear permeates the novel: "Fear, isolation, and abandonment characterize the lives of the first-person narrator and her three friends....M<U+00FC>ller describes how fear acquires a life of its own; it becomes independent of the subject's will."<ref name="glajar"/> One critic argues that "''Herztier'' was written in response to the trauma of life under the Ceau<U+015F>escu dictatorship, when the citizens of Romania lived in constant fear of the secret police or Securitate."<ref name="eddy"/> As M<U+00FC>ller said in an interview, this fear in the novel is autobiographical as well.<ref name="schule"/>

According to Beverley Driver Eddy, ''The Land of Green Plums'' presents trauma as well as its testimony; the narrator gives her own testimony, and relates it to the testimony of her friends' suffering. The first of these is Lola, the friend who supposedly kills herself; her testimony is preserved in her diary, in which she wrote of her animalistic sexual exploits with nameless men and her struggle to cope with the guilt of having joined the Communist Party in an effort to better herself. For the narrator, preserving Lola's notebook (and sharing it with her three friends) becomes of paramount importance, especially since the memory of Lola was erased days after her death by the Party establishment.<ref name="eddy"/> Additional complexity comes from Lola's testimony being interwoven in the narrator's own<U+2014>"a testimony within a testimony."<ref name="eddy"/> M<U+00FC>ller herself, in an interview published in 1998,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Beverley Driver|title=Herta M<U+00FC>ller: Art Transcends Boundaries|journal=[[Provincetown Arts]]|year=1997-1998|volume=13|pages=45<U+2013>46}}</ref> explained that "she is concerned with showing that the childhood experiences have been internalised by the narrator, and that the traumas of the frightened, non-conformist child are replicated to the larger traumas of the adult dissident."<ref name="eddy"/> In the image of the weeds cut down by the narrator's father, an image presented early in the novel, the parallel between the father and the dictator is evidenced: "both 'make cemeteries' without fear of retribution." One symptom of the trauma this causes in its victims is disconnection, the strain of friendship resulting from lack of trust, disrupting normal human relationships for the remainder of the victim's life; M<U+00FC>ller's novel portrays this disconnection and the ongoing trauma for survivors, even after the fall of the dictatorship.<ref name="eddy"/>

Other critics have focused on different effects of trauma in the novel and in M<U+00FC>ller's work in general. Lyn Marven argues that the M<U+00FC>llers poetics and style, characterized by [[Parataxis|paratactic]] as well as syntactic and narrative gaps, illustrates one of the effects of trauma: "Trauma disrupts the structures of memory....Trauma cannot be integrated into narrative memory and exists only as a gap or blank spot; it therefore cannot be articulated, and returns in the form of surprisingly literal flashbacks, hallucinations, or dreams."<ref name="marven"/> Marven notes another effect: a "distorted body image" that often gives rise to a "radical metonymy," a fragmentation, surfacing most notably in a scene where Pjele, during an interrogation, lists the narrator's clothes and possessions, to which the narrator responds by listing her own body parts:<ref name="marven"/> "1 pr. eyes, 1 pr. ears, 1 nose, 1 pr. lips, 1 neck."<ref>{{cite book|last=M<U+00FC>ller|first=Herta|title=The Land of Green Plums|year=1998|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=9780810115972|page=135|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EID4smWDEIgC&pg=PA135}}</ref> Marven notes that M<U+00FC>ller's [[collage]]s, which Marven calls "central to M<U+00FC>ller's <U+0153>uvre," evidence the same fragmentation, and says that her "increasingly readable" prose (signaled also by Grazziella Predoui, who notes that M<U+00FC>ller's prose is developing from parataxis toward more complicated syntax<ref>{{cite book|last=Predoiu|first=Gabriella|title=Faszination und Provokation bei Herta M<U+00FC>ller|year=2001|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9783631371053|page=186}}</ref>) coupled with recent collages moving toward narrative might suggest that there is "a possibility of overcoming trauma."<ref name="marven"/>

===Banat-Swabians===
The situation of the Banat-Swabians, the German-speaking minority in Romania, is a recurring theme in M<U+00FC>ller's writing, and it is one of the central themes of ''The Land of Green Plums'', investigated in detail in Valentine Glajar's 1997 article "Banat-Swabian, Romanian, and German: Conflicting Identities in Herta M<U+00FC>ller's ''Herztier''." The Banat-Swabian community, which the narrator is a member of, was described by M<U+00FC>ller as extremely ethnocentric; while they had no desire to emigrate to Germany, they exerted an almost totalitarian control especially on their children to keep them in their community.<ref name="glajar"/> M<U+00FC>ller had already addressed this topic in her first work, ''[[Nadirs|Niederungen]]'', translated as ''Nadirs'' in English, in which the German community holds on to its language and habits in an attempt to deny the Romanian dictatorship that rules them; one critic characterized this communal attempt in ''Niederungen'' as a "mechanistically followed tradition".<ref name="jones">{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Calvin N.|title=Rev. of Herta M<U+00FC>ller, ''Nadirs''|journal=[[South Atlantic Review]]|year=2000|volume=65|issue=4|pages=211<U+2013>13}}</ref>

According to Glajar, this is the world of the narrator's mother, who writes of her sicknesses in her letters in the hope of keeping her daughter emotionally connected to her home village. The narrator's father was a member of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] (as were M<U+00FC>ller's father and uncle), and thus presents a troubling example of Germanness. The novel proposes a tension inside Romania between the culturally totalitarian atmosphere of the Banat-Swabian community and the politically totalitarian world of [[Timi<U+015F>oara]], where the main characters attend college<U+2014>between German and Romanian. But the main characters who move to Germany quickly discover that although they were German in Romania, they are Romanian in Germany. They face social and linguistic difficulties, resulting in Georg's suicide a few weeks after his arrival in Frankfurt.<ref name="glajar"/>

==Critical reception==
===Academic interest===
The book attracted academic interest very quickly, and scholars have discussed it in at least three distinct categories: language and style, often in relation to the politics of totalitarianism;<ref>{{cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Ricarda|title=Herta M<U+00FC>ller|year=1998|publisher=University of Wales Press|editor=Brigid Haines |chapter=Metapher, Metonymie und Moral.

===Attention in the press===
In the German press, the novel's publication generated modest but positive attention. Rolf Michaelis reviewed the novel at length in ''[[Die Zeit]]'' in October 1994, analyzing the function of fear and praising the book as a "poetic epic", comparing transitions and structure to those found in [[Homer]]. "Herta M<U+00FC>ller", he wrote, "does not simply use the German language; she makes it her own, in an incomparable way. She invents her own language."<ref>{{cite news|last=Michaelis|first=Rolf|title=In der Angst zu Haus|url=http://www.zeit.de/1994/41/In-der-Angst-zu-Haus|accessdate=9 December 2010|newspaper=[[Die Zeit]]|date=7 October 1994|quote=Herta M<U+00FC>ller bedient sich der deutschen Sprache nicht nur, sie macht sie sich auf unvergleichliche Art zu eigen.

The "green plums" of the title stand in part for truth and its brutal suppression in a world of interrogators and informers, where speaking out can become a matter of life and death.<p>The author's style, achieves a spartan eloquence, and the novel's individual characters are powerfully drawn.<p>This elegantly understated book is at once bleak and beautiful, humorous and heartbreaking.<ref>{{cite web|title=Citation|url=http://www.impacdublinaward.ie/winner98citation.doc|publisher=[[International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award]]|accessdate=9 December 2010}}</ref>}}
