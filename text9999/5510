'''''Last Post''''' is a poem written by [[Carol Ann Duffy]], the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom]], in 2009.  It was commissioned by the BBC to mark the deaths of [[Henry Allingham]] and [[Harry Patch]], two of the last three surviving British veterans from the [[World War I|First World War]], and was first broadcast on the [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''[[Today programme|Today]]'' on 30 July 2009, the date of Allingham's funeral.  

The poem, named after the [[Last Post]] (the bugle call used at British ceremonies remembering those killed in war), makes explicit references to [[Wilfred Owen]]'s poem from the First World War ''[[Dulce et Decorum Est]]''. It imagines what would happen if time ran backwards and those killed in the war came back to life; their lives would still be full of possibilities and filled with "love, work, children, talent, English beer, good food."<ref name=Times/>  The poem was generally well received, with one commentator saying that it was "simply a damn good poem with rich imagery, cinematic movement and poignant ending."<ref name=Lundberg/> Another said that it was "moving reversal of history" and a "fine poem".<ref name=Times/> Duffy herself was quoted as saying that she wanted to honour the tradition of poets who were soldiers.

==Poem==
[[File:Wilfred-Owen.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wilfred Owen]]]]
The poem takes its title from the bugle call used at British ceremonies remembering those killed in war, the [[Last Post]].  It begins with two lines from the poem ''[[Dulce et Decorum Est]]'' by the First World War poet [[Wilfred Owen]]:<ref name=Today/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/collections/item/3303?CISOBOX=1&REC=1|title=Dulce et Decorum Est|work=First World War Poetry Digital Archive|publisher=[[University of Oxford]]|accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref>
<poem>
''In all my dreams, before my helpless sight''
''He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning''.
</poem>
The title of Owen's poem is part of a line from the Roman poet [[Horace]] &ndash; ''{{lang|lat|[[Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori]]}}'' ("It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country").  The phrase was inscribed over the chapel door at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]], the British military academy, in 1913.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Wilfred Owen and the Soldier Poets |last=Norgate|first=Paul|journal=The Review of English Studies, New Series|volume=40|number=160 |month=November|year=1989|pages=521&ndash;522|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/517098 |format=subscription access|accessdate=31 August 2009}}</ref>  The phrase is again referenced when Duffy writes "Dulce&nbsp;<U+2014> No&nbsp;<U+2014> Decorum&nbsp;<U+2014> No&nbsp;<U+2014> Pro patria mori."  The writer Will Heaven said that, whilst the poem denies that death in war is "sweet and proper" (''dulce et decorum''), it does not deny that the soldiers died for their country (''pro patria mori'').<ref name=Heaven/>  

The heart of the poem depicts events "if poetry could tell it backwards"&nbsp;<U+2013> soldiers who died in the war coming back to life, "lines and lines of British boys rewind / back to their trenches".  The poem imagines "all those thousands dead / are shaking dried mud from their hair / and queuing up for home".  Duffy pictures what would have happened to them if they had not died:
<poem>
''You lean against a wall,''
''your several million lives still possible''
''and crammed with love, work, children, talent, English beer, good food.''
</poem>
before adding, "You see the poet tuck away his pocket-book and smile".<ref name=Today/> [[Erica Wagner]], the literary editor of ''[[The Times]]'', said that the poet Duffy refers to in the poem could be Owen, but could also be [[John McCrae]], [[Isaac Rosenberg]], or [[Charles Hamilton Sorley]], or one of a number of other poets from the war. Wagner also noted that "Harry Patch and Henry Allingham escaped death, but never the effect of that awful war."<ref name=Times>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/poetry/article6733286.ece|title=Review: Last Post by Carol Ann Duffy|work=[[The Times]]|last=Wagner|first=Erica|authorlink=Erica Wagner|date=30 July 2009|accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref>

==Reaction==
The poem received a generally favourable critical reaction. Wagner called it a "moving reversal of history", a "fine poem", and "the latest in a noble line of work [about the First World War] that aspires to a kind of salvation."<ref name=Times/> Heaven said that it was a "poignant and beautiful tribute" to Allingham.<ref name=Heaven>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/willheaven/100005170/carol-ann-duffy%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98last-post%E2%80%99-is-a-fitting-tribute-to-henry-allingham-his-fallen-comrades/|title=Carol Ann Duffy's 'Last Post' is a fitting tribute to Henry Allingham and his fallen comrades |publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]]|last=Heaven|first=Will|date=30 July 2009|accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref>  It has been called "sombre yet supremely uplifting".<ref name=Mirror/> The poem was also noticed in the United States. Jenna Krajeski, a writer for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', described it as "another strong at-bat", and said that the poem highlighted "the power, but also the shortcomings, of poetry" when writing about an "imaginary, impossible event" and also writing about writing about it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2009/07/keeping-score-carol-ann-duffy.html|title=Keeping Score: Carol Ann Duffy|last=Krajeski|first=Jenna|publisher=[[New Yorker]]|date=30 July 2009|accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref> The American poet John Lundberg said that the poem was a "surprising success", adding that not only was it "accessible" and "a fitting tribute to those who served in World War I," but also "simply a damn good poem with rich imagery, cinematic movement and poignant ending."<ref name=Lundberg>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-lundberg/britains-poet-laureate-re_b_248658.html|title=Britain's Poet Laureate Remembers The Great War|last=Lundberg|first=John|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref> However, Christopher Howse, a writer for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', took a different view of the poem's merits, saying (under the title "Carol Ann Duffy falls short of Henry Allingham") that Duffy's verse form was "open, to the point of invisibility".<ref name=Howse>{{cite web|title=Carol Ann Duffy falls short of Henry Allingham|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/christopherhowse/100001970/carol-ann-duffy-falls-short-of-henry-allingham/|last=Howse|first=Christopher|publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]]|date=30 July 2009|accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref>
