The '''Tunguska event''' was an enormously powerful [[explosion]] that occurred near the [[Podkamennaya Tunguska River]] in what is now [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], at about 07:14 [[Krasnoyarsk Time|KRAT]] (00:14 [[Universal Time|UT]]) on {{OldStyleDateNY|June 30|June 17}}, 1908.<ref>Pasechnik, I.

Although the meteoroid or comet appears to have burst in the air rather than hitting the surface, this event still is referred to as an [[impact event|impact]].

At around 07:17 local time, [[Evenks]] natives and Russian settlers in the hills northwest of [[Lake Baikal]] observed a column of bluish light, nearly as bright as the [[Sun]], moving across the sky. About 10 minutes later, there was a flash and a sound similar to artillery fire. Eyewitnesses closer to the explosion reported the sound source moving east to north. The sounds were accompanied by a [[shock wave]] that knocked people off their feet and broke windows hundreds of kilometres away. The majority of witnesses reported only the sounds and the tremors, not the sighting of the explosion. Eyewitness accounts differ as to the sequence of events and their overall duration.

The explosion registered on [[seismology|seismic stations]] across [[Eurasia]]. In some places the shock wave would have been equivalent to an earthquake of 5.0 on the [[Richter scale]].<ref name=Traynor2>Traynor, Chris, ''The Tunguska Event, [[Journal of the British Astronomical Association]],'' 107, 3, 1997</ref> It also produced fluctuations in [[atmospheric pressure]] strong enough to be detected in Great Britain.

===Selected eyewitness reports===
[[Image:Tunguska epicenter.jpg|right|thumb|The Southern swamp<U+2014>the epicentre of the Tunguska explosion, in 2008]]

Testimony of S. Semenov, as recorded by [[Leonid Kulik]]'s expedition in 1930:<ref>N. V. Vasiliev, A. F. Kovalevsky, S. A. Razin, L. E. Epiktetova (1981). ''[http://tunguska.tsc.ru/ru/science/1/0 Eyewitness accounts of Tunguska (Crash).]'', Section 6, Item 4</ref>
{{quote|At breakfast time I was sitting by the house at [[Vanavara, Krasnoyarsk|Vanavara]] Trading Post [''65 kilometres/40 miles south of the explosion''], facing north. [...] I suddenly saw that directly to the north, over Onkoul's Tunguska Road, the sky split in two and fire appeared high and wide over the forest [''as Semenov showed, about 50 degrees up<U+2014>expedition note'']. The split in the sky grew larger, and the entire northern side was covered with fire. At that moment I became so hot that I couldn't bear it, as if my shirt was on fire; from the northern side, where the fire was, came strong heat. I wanted to tear off my shirt and throw it down, but then the sky shut closed, and a strong thump sounded, and I was thrown a few metres. I lost my senses for a moment, but then my wife ran out and led me to the house. After that such noise came, as if rocks were falling or cannons were firing, the earth shook, and when I was on the ground, I pressed my head down, fearing rocks would smash it. When the sky opened up, hot wind raced between the houses, like from cannons, which left traces in the ground like pathways, and it damaged some crops. Later we saw that many windows were shattered, and in the barn a part of the iron lock snapped.}}

Testimony of Chuchan of Shanyagir tribe, as recorded by I.M. Suslov in 1926:<ref>Vasiliev, Section 5</ref>
{{quote|We had a hut by the river with my brother Chekaren. We were sleeping. Suddenly we both woke up at the same time. Somebody shoved us. We heard whistling and felt strong wind. Chekaren said, 'Can you hear all those birds flying overhead?' We were both in the hut, couldn't see what was going on outside. Suddenly, I got shoved again, this time so hard I fell into the fire. I got scared. Chekaren got scared too. We started crying out for father, mother, brother, but no one answered. There was noise beyond the hut, we could hear trees falling down. Chekaren and I got out of our sleeping bags and wanted to run out, but then the thunder struck. This was the first thunder. The Earth began to move and rock, wind hit our hut and knocked it over. My body was pushed down by sticks, but my head was in the clear. Then I saw a wonder: trees were falling, the branches were on fire, it became mighty bright, how can I say this, as if there was a second sun, my eyes were hurting, I even closed them. It was like what the Russians call lightning. And immediately there was a loud thunderclap. This was the second thunder. The morning was sunny, there were no clouds, our Sun was shining brightly as usual, and suddenly there came a second one!

Chekaren and I had some difficulty getting out from under the remains of our hut. Then we saw that above, but in a different place, there was another flash, and loud thunder came. This was the third thunder strike. Wind came again, knocked us off our feet, struck against the fallen trees.

We looked at the fallen trees, watched the tree tops get snapped off, watched the fires. Suddenly Chekaren yelled 'Look up' and pointed with his hand. I looked there and saw another flash, and it made another thunder. But the noise was less than before. This was the fourth strike, like normal thunder.

Now I remember well there was also one more thunder strike, but it was small, and somewhere far away, where the Sun goes to sleep.}}

''Sibir'' newspaper, July 2, 1908:<ref>Vasiliev, Section 1, Item 2</ref>
{{quote|On the 17th of June, around 9 a.m. in the morning, we observed an unusual natural occurrence. In the north Karelinski village [200 [[verst]] north of [[Kirensk]]] the peasants saw to the north west, rather high above the horizon, some strangely bright (impossible to look at) bluish-white heavenly body, which for 10 minutes moved downwards. The body appeared as a "pipe", i.e., a cylinder. The sky was cloudless, only a small dark cloud was observed in the general direction of the bright body. It was hot and dry. As the body neared the ground (forest), the bright body seemed to smudge, and then turned into a giant [[billow]] of black smoke, and a loud knocking (not thunder) was heard, as if large stones were falling, or artillery was fired. All buildings shook. At the same time the cloud began emitting flames of uncertain shapes. All villagers were stricken with panic and took to the streets, women cried, thinking it was the end of the world.

The author of these lines was meantime in the forest about 6 verst [6.4 km] north of Kirensk, and heard to the north east some kind of artillery barrage, that repeated in intervals of 15 minutes at least 10 times. In Kirensk in a few buildings in the walls facing north east window glass shook.}}

Siberian Life newspaper, July 27, 1908:<ref>Vasiliev, Section 1, Item 3</ref>
{{quote|When the meteorite fell, strong tremors in the ground were observed, and near the Lovat village of the [[Kansk]] [[uezd]] two strong explosions were heard, as if from large-caliber artillery.}}

''Krasnoyaretz'' newspaper, July 13, 1908:<ref>Vasiliev, Section 1, Item 5</ref>
{{quote|Kezhemskoe village. On the 17th an unusual atmospheric event was observed. At 7:43 the noise akin to a strong wind was heard. Immediately afterwards a horrific thump sounded, followed by an earthquake that literally shook the buildings, as if they were hit by a large log or a heavy rock. The first thump was followed by a second, and then a third. Then the interval between the first and the third thumps were accompanied by an unusual underground rattle, similar to a railway upon which dozens of trains are travelling at the same time. Afterwards for 5 to 6 minutes an exact likeness of artillery fire was heard: 50 to 60 salvoes in short, equal intervals, which got progressively weaker. After 1.5<U+2013>2 minutes after one of the "barrages" six more thumps were heard, like cannon firing, but individual, loud and accompanied by tremors.

The sky, at the first sight, appeared to be clear. There was no wind and no clouds. However upon closer inspection to the north, i.e. where most of the thumps were heard, a kind of an ashen cloud was seen near the horizon, which kept getting smaller and more transparent and possibly by around 2<U+2013>3 p.m. completely disappeared.}}

==Investigations==
There was little scientific curiosity about the impact at the time, possibly due to the isolation of the Tunguska region. If there were any early expeditions to the site, the records were likely to have been lost during the subsequent chaotic years<U+2014>[[World War I]], the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the [[Russian Civil War]].

The first recorded expedition arrived at the scene more than a decade after the event. In 1921, the Russian [[mineralogy|mineralogist]] [[Leonid Kulik]], visiting the Podkamennaya Tunguska River basin as part of a survey for the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]], deduced from local accounts that the explosion had been caused by a giant [[impact event|meteorite impact]]. He persuaded the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government to fund an expedition to the Tunguska region, based on the prospect of [[meteoric iron]] that could be salvaged to aid Soviet industry. Kulik's party eventually undertook an expedition in 1927.

[[Image:Tunguska event fallen trees.jpg|left|thumb|Photograph from Kulik's 1929 expedition taken near the Hushmo river.]]

Upon arrival, Kulik made arrangements with the local [[Evenks|Evenki]] hunters to guide his party to the impact site. Reaching the explosion site was an extremely arduous task. Upon reaching an area just south of the site, the superstitious Evenki hunters would go no farther, fearing what they called the Valleymen. Kulik had to return to the nearby village, and his party was delayed for several days while they sought new guides.

The spectacle that confronted Kulik as he stood on a ridge overlooking the devastated area was overwhelming. To the explorers' surprise, no [[impact crater|crater]] was to be found. There was instead around [[ground zero]] a vast zone ({{convert|8|km|mi|disp=x| [|]}} across) of trees scorched and devoid of branches, but standing upright. Those farther away had been partly scorched and knocked down in a direction away from the centre. Much later, in the 1960s, it was established that the zone of leveled forest occupied an area of some {{convert|2150|km2|sqmi}}, its shape resembling a gigantic spread-eagled butterfly with a "wingspan" of {{convert|70|km}} and a "body length" of {{convert|55|km}}.<ref>Boyarkina, A. P., Demin, D. V., Zotkin, I. T., Fast, W. G.

Upon closer examination, Kulik located holes which he erroneously concluded were meteorite holes; however, he did not have the means at this time to excavate the holes.

During the next ten years there were three more expeditions to the area. Kulik found several dozens of little "pothole" bogs, each some {{convert|10|to|50|m}} in diameter, that he thought might be meteoric craters. After a laborious exercise in draining one of these [[bog]]s (the so-called "Suslov<U+2019>s crater", {{convert|32|m|ft|disp=x| [|]}} in diameter), he found there was an old [[Tree stump|stump]] on the bottom, ruling out the possibility that it was a meteoric crater. In 1938, Kulik arranged for an aerial photographic survey of the area<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-th.bo.infn.it/tunguska/APS-photolist.htm |author=Longo G. |title=The 1938 aerophotosurvey |accessdate=2008-01-03 |work= }}</ref> covering the central part of the leveled forest (some {{convert|250|km2|sqmi|disp=x| [|]}}).<ref name="Bronshten2000">See: Bronshten (2000), p. 56.</ref> The negatives of these aerial photographs (1,500 negatives, each {{convert|18|by|18|cm|in|disp=x| [|]}}) were burned in 1975 by order of [[Yevgeny Krinov]], then Chairman of the Committee on Meteorites of the USSR Academy of Sciences.<ref name="Bronshten2000"/> It was done under the pretext that they were a [[Nitrate film|fire hazard]], but the truth may have been the active dislike by official meteorite specialists of anything associated with an unyielding enigma. However, positive imprints would be preserved for further studies in the Russian city of [[Tomsk]].<ref>Rubtsov (2009), p.59</ref>

Expeditions sent to the area in the 1950s and 1960s found microscopic [[silicate]] and [[magnetite]] spheres in siftings of the soil. Similar spheres were predicted to exist in the felled trees, although they could not be detected by contemporary means. Later expeditions did identify such spheres in the resin of the trees. [[Chemical analysis]] showed that the spheres contained high proportions of [[nickel]] relative to [[iron]], which is also found in [[meteorite]]s, leading to the conclusion they were of extraterrestrial origin. The concentration of the spheres in different regions of the soil was also found to be consistent with the expected distribution of debris from a meteorite [[air burst]].<ref name=Florenskiy /> Later studies of the spheres found unusual ratios of numerous other metals relative to the surrounding environment, which was taken as further evidence of their extraterrestrial origin.<ref name=anomalies />

Chemical analysis of [[peat bog]]s from the area also revealed numerous anomalies considered consistent with an impact event. The [[isotopic signature]]s of stable carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen isotopes at the layer of the bogs corresponding to 1908 were found to be inconsistent with the isotopic ratios measured in the adjacent layers, and this abnormality was not found in bogs located outside the area. The region of the bogs showing these anomalous signatures also contains an unusually high proportion of [[iridium]], similar to the iridium layer found in the [[Cretaceous<U+2013>Paleogene boundary]]. These unusual proportions are believed to result from debris from the falling body that deposited in the bogs. The nitrogen is believed to have been deposited as [[acid rain]], a suspected fallout from the explosion.<ref name=anomalies /><ref>Hou ''et al.

==Earth impactor model==

===Asteroid air burst===
The leading scientific explanation for the explosion is the [[air burst]] of an [[asteroid]] 6<U+2013>10&nbsp;kilometres (4<U+2013>6&nbsp;miles) above Earth's surface.

Meteoroids enter [[Earth's atmosphere]] from [[outer space]] every day, travelling at a speed of at least {{convert|11|km/s}}. The [[heat]] generated by compression of air in front of the body ([[ram pressure]]) as it travels through the atmosphere is immense and most asteroids burn up or explode before they reach the ground. Since the second half of the 20th century, close monitoring of Earth's atmosphere has led to the discovery that such asteroid air bursts occur rather frequently. A stony asteroid of about 10 metres (30&nbsp;[[foot (length)|ft]]) in diameter can produce an explosion of around 20 [[TNT equivalent|kilotons]], similar to that of the [[Fat Man]] bomb dropped on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], and data released by the U.S. Air Force's [[Defense Support Program]] indicate that such explosions occur high in the upper atmosphere more than once a year. Tunguska-like [[TNT equivalent|megaton-range]] events are much rarer. [[Eugene Merle Shoemaker|Eugene Shoemaker]] estimated that such events occur about once every 300 years.<ref>[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/phenom_jan95.html?c=y&page=2 Phenomena, Comment & Notes], By John P.

===Blast patterns===
The explosion's effect on the trees near the epicentre of the explosion was replicated during [[nuclear testing|atmospheric nuclear tests]] in the 1950s and 1960s,{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}{{Discuss}} and was similar to the effects of the conventional [[Operation Blowdown]]. These effects are caused by the [[blast wave]] produced by large [[explosion]]s. The trees directly below the explosion are stripped as the blast wave moves vertically downward, while trees farther away are knocked over because the blast wave is travelling closer to horizontal when it reaches them.

Soviet experiments performed in the mid-1960s, with model forests (made of [[match]]es on wire stakes) and small explosive charges slid downward on wires, produced butterfly shaped blast patterns strikingly similar to the pattern found at the Tunguska site. The experiments suggested that the object had approached at an angle of roughly 30 degrees from the ground and 115 degrees from north and had exploded in mid-air.<ref>{{IMDb title|1156463}}</ref>

===Asteroid or comet===
In 1930, the British astronomer [[Francis John Welsh Whipple|F.J.W. Whipple]] suggested that the Tunguska body was a small [[comet]]. A cometary meteorite, being composed primarily of [[ice]] and [[dust]], could have been completely [[vaporize]]d by the impact with the Earth's atmosphere, leaving no obvious traces. The comet hypothesis was further supported by the glowing skies (or "skyglows" or "bright nights") observed across Europe for several evenings after the impact, possibly explained by dust and ice that had been dispersed from the comet's tail across the upper atmosphere.<ref name="shoe"/> The cometary hypothesis gained a general acceptance amongst Soviet Tunguska investigators by the 1960s.<ref name="shoe" />

In 1978, astronomer [[<U+013D>ubor Kres<U+00E1>k]] suggested that the body was a fragment of the short-period [[Comet Encke]], which is responsible for the [[Beta Taurid]] [[meteor shower]]: the Tunguska event coincided with a peak in that shower,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Tunguska object<U+2014>A fragment of Comet Encke |publisher=Astronomical Institutes of Czechoslovakia |bibcode=1978BAICz..29..129K}}</ref> and the approximate trajectory of the Tunguska impactor is consistent with what would be expected from such a fragment.<ref name="shoe" /> It is now known that bodies of this kind explode at frequent intervals tens to hundreds of kilometres above the ground. Military satellites have been observing these explosions for decades.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Nemtchinov |first=I.V. |coauthors=C. Jacobs and E. Tagliaferri |title=Analysis of Satellite Observations of Large Meteoroid Impacts |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=822 |issue=1 Near<U+2013>Earth Ob |pages=303<U+2013>317 |year=1997 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb48348.x|bibcode = 1997NYASA.822..303N }}</ref>

In 1983, astronomer Zden<U+011B>k Sekanina published a paper criticizing the comet hypothesis. He pointed out that a body composed of cometary material, travelling through the atmosphere along such a shallow trajectory, ought to have disintegrated, whereas the Tunguska body apparently remained intact into the lower atmosphere. Sekanina argued that the evidence pointed to a dense, rocky object, probably of [[asteroid]]al origin. This hypothesis was further boosted in 2001, when Farinella, Foschini, ''et al.'' released a study suggesting that the object had arrived from the direction of the [[asteroid belt]].

Proponents of the comet hypothesis have suggested that the object was an [[extinct comet]] with a stony mantle that allowed it to penetrate the atmosphere.

The chief difficulty in the asteroid hypothesis is that a stony object should have produced a large [[Impact crater|crater]] where it struck the ground, but no such crater has been found. It has been hypothesized that the passage of the asteroid through the atmosphere caused pressures and temperatures to build up to a point where the asteroid abruptly disintegrated in a huge explosion. The destruction would have to have been so complete that no remnants of substantial size survived, and the material scattered into the upper atmosphere during the explosion would have caused the skyglows. Models published in 1993 suggested that the stony body would have been about {{convert|60|m}} across, with physical properties somewhere between an ordinary [[chondrite]] and a [[carbonaceous chondrite]].

Christopher Chyba and others have proposed a process whereby a stony meteorite could have exhibited the behavior of the Tunguska impactor. Their models show that when the forces opposing a body's descent become greater than the cohesive force holding it together, it blows apart, releasing nearly all its energy at once. The result is no crater, and damage distributed over a fairly wide radius, all of the damage being blast and thermal.

Kelly ''et al.'' (2009) contend that the impact was caused by a comet because of the sightings of [[noctilucent clouds]] following the impact, a phenomenon caused by massive amounts of water vapor in the upper atmosphere. They compared the noctilucent cloud phenomenon to the exhaust plume from NASA's [[space shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'' space shuttle]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Two-dimensional turbulence, space shuttle plume transport in the thermosphere, and a possible relation to the Great Siberian Impact Event|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|date=Accepted for publication on 2009-06-22|first=M.C.|last=Kelly|coauthors=C.

In 2010, an expedition of Vladimir Alexeev, with scientists from the Troitsk Innovation and Nuclear Research Institute (TRINITY), used ground penetrating radar to examine the Suslov crater at the Tunguska site. What they found was that the crater was created by the violent impact of a celestial body. The layers of the crater consisted of modern permafrost on top, older damaged layers underneath and finally, deep below, fragments of the celestial body were discovered. Preliminary analysis showed that it was a huge piece of ice that shattered on impact, which seem to support the theory that a comet caused the cataclysm.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://english.pravda.ru/science/mysteries/25-10-2010/115495-tunguska_meteorite-0/ |title=Mystery of Tunguska meteorite solved |publisher=Pravda|date=2010-10-25 |accessdate=2013-02-17}}</ref>

==Speculative conjectures==
The behaviour of meteoroids in the Earth's atmosphere was less well understood during the early decades of the 20th century. Due to this, as well as the paucity of relevant data resulting from Soviet secrecy during the [[Cold War]], a great many other conjectures about the Tunguska event have sprung up, none of which are accepted by the majority of the scientific community.

===Comet 2005&nbsp;NB<sub>56</sub>===
One study "suggests that a chunk of [[2005 NB56|Comet 2005&nbsp;NB<sub>56</sub>]] caused the 5<U+2013>10&nbsp;megaton fireball, bouncing off the atmosphere and back into orbit around the sun." The scientists involved in the study claim that the object that caused the event will pass close to [[Earth]] again in 2045.<ref>[http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/natural-disasters/4316464 When Comets Attack: Solving the Mystery of the Biggest Natural Explosion in Modern History], By Mark Anderson, Popular Mechanics</ref>

Independently, in 1990, C<U+00E9>sar Sirvent proposed that a deuterium comet, i.e., a comet with an anomalous high concentration of deuterium in its composition, could have exploded as a natural hydrogen bomb, generating most of the energy released.
