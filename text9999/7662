'''''Dumbo''''' is a 1941 American animated film produced by [[Walt Disney]] and released on October 23, 1941, by [[RKO Radio Pictures]]. 

The fourth film in the [[Walt Disney Animated Classics|Walt Disney Animated Classics series]], ''Dumbo'' is based upon the storyline written by Helen Aberson and illustrated by Harold Pearl for the prototype of a novelty toy ("Roll-a-Book").<ref>''[http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-helen-aberson-mayer-1086764.html Obituary: Helen Aberson Mayer.] www.independent.co.uk.'' April 12, 1999. Retrieved September 30, 2009.</ref> The main character is Jumbo Jr., a semi-[[anthropomorphic]] [[elephant]] who is cruelly nicknamed "Dumbo". He is ridiculed for his big [[ear]]s, but in fact he is capable of [[flight|flying]] by using his ears as [[wing]]s. Throughout most of the film, his only true friend, aside from his mother, is the [[mouse]], Timothy <U+2014> a relationship parodying the stereotypical animosity between mice and elephants.

''Dumbo'' was made to recoup the financial losses of ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]''.  It was a deliberate pursuit of simplicity and economy for the Disney studio, and at 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features.

==Plot==
While circus animals are being transported, Mrs. Jumbo, one of the elephants, receives her baby from a [[stork]]. The baby elephant is quickly taunted by the other elephants because of his large ears, and they nickname him "Dumbo".

Once the circus is set up, Mrs. Jumbo loses her temper at a group of boys for making fun of her son, and she is locked up and deemed mad. Dumbo is shunned by the other elephants and with no mother to care for him, he is now alone, except for a self-appointed mentor and protector, Timothy Q. Mouse, who feels sympathy for Dumbo and becomes determined to make him happy again.

The circus director makes Dumbo the top of an elephant pyramid stunt, but Dumbo's ears causes the stunt to go wrong, injuring the other elephants and bringing down the big top. Dumbo is made a clown as a result, and plays the main role in an act that involves him falling into a vat of pie filling. Despite his newfound popularity and fame, Dumbo hates this job and is now more miserable than ever.

To cheer Dumbo up, Timothy takes him to visit his mother. On the way back Dumbo cries and then starts to hiccup so Timothy decides to take him for a drink of water from a bucket which, unknown to him, has accidentally had a bottle of champagne knocked into it. As a result, Dumbo and Timothy both become drunk and see hallucinations of pink elephants (the famous [[Pink Elephants on Parade]] sequence).

The next morning, Dumbo and Timothy wake up in a tree. Timothy wonders how they got up in the tree, and concludes that Dumbo flew up there using his large ears as wings. With the help of a group of crows, Timothy is able to get Dumbo to fly again, using a psychological trick of a "magic feather" to boost his confidence. 

Back at the circus, Dumbo must perform his stunt of jumping from a high building, this time from a much higher platform.  On the way down, Dumbo loses the feather and Timothy tells him that the feather was never magical, and that he is still able to fly. Dumbo is able to pull out of the dive and flies around the circus, finally striking back at his tormentors as the stunned audience looks on in amazement.

After this performance, Dumbo becomes a media sensation, Timothy becomes his manager, and Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo are given a private car on the circus train.

==Production==
The film was designed as an economical feature to help generate income for the Disney studio after the financial failures of both ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' and ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]'' in 1940. The studio's income had also been negatively impacted due to the war in Europe.<ref>{{cite web| title=TCM's Leading Ladies, 'Dumbo' at the El Capitan| url=http://boxofficemojo.com/features/?id=2077&p=.htm| publisher=www.boxofficemojo.com| author=Holleran, Scott| date=June 1, 2006| accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref> Storymen [[Dick Huemer]] and [[Joe Grant]] were the primary figures in developing the plot, based upon the story written by Helen Aberson and illustrated by Harold Pearl (the only involvement the authors had with the cartoon industry) that was prepared to demonstrate the prototype of a toy storytelling display device called Roll-A-Book, which was similar in principle to a [[Moving panorama|panorama]]. It involved only eight drawings and just a few lines of text. John Clarke Rose, Story Research Director at the Disney Studio during this period, told animation historian [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]] the story was brought to his attention by Disney's head of merchandise licensing Kay Kamen, who had been shown the prototype that included ''Dumbo'' to illustrate the device. Rose passed along the storyline to Walt Disney who immediately grasped its possibilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Essays/DumboRollABook/DumboRollABook.html |title=The Mysterious '&#39;Dumbo'&#39; Roll-A-Book |publisher=Michaelbarrier.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-31}}</ref>

When the film went into production in early 1941, supervising director [[Ben Sharpsteen]] was given orders to keep the film simple and inexpensive. As a result, ''Dumbo'' lacks the lavish detail of the previous three Disney animated features (''Fantasia'', ''Pinocchio'', and ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''): character designs are simpler, background [[painting]]s are less detailed, and a number of held cels (or frames) were used in the [[traditional animation|character animation]].

[[Watercolor painting|Watercolor paint]] was used to render the backgrounds. ''Dumbo'' and ''Snow White'' are the only two classic Disney features to use the technique,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} which was regularly employed for the various Disney cartoon shorts. The other Disney features used [[oil paint]] and [[gouache]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} 2002's ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'', which drew influences from ''Dumbo'', also made use of watercolor backgrounds.

The simplicity freed the animators from being overly concerned with detail, and allowed them to focus on the most important element of character animation: [[acting]]. [[Bill Tytla]]'s animation of Dumbo is today considered one of the greatest accomplishments in American [[traditional animation]].{{By whom|date=April 2010}}  The critical reactions were positive, as many critics of the day felt that ''Dumbo'' was a return to roots for Disney after growing increasingly "arty" with its predecessors.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

On May 29, 1941, during production of ''Dumbo'', much of the Disney studio staff went on the [[Disney animators' strike]]. A number of strikers are caricatured in the feature as clowns who go to "hit the big boss for a raise". The strike lasted five weeks, and ended the "family" atmosphere and camaraderie at the studio. 

None of the [[voice actors]] for Dumbo received screen credit,<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033563/ Voice actors listed as uncredited on IMDB]</ref> but Timothy Mouse, who befriended Dumbo even in his darkest days and was instrumental in helping him find greatness within himself, was voiced by [[Edward Brophy]], a [[character actor]] known for portraying [[gangsters]]. He has no other known [[animation]] voice credits. The pompous matriarch of the elephants was voiced by [[Verna Felton]], who also played the [[List of Disney's Cinderella characters#Fairy Godmother|Fairy Godmother]] in ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', the Queen of Hearts in ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', and Flora of the Three Good Fairies in ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''. Other voice actors include the perennial [[Sterling Holloway]] in a [[cameo role]] as Mr. Stork, and [[Cliff Edwards]], better known as the voice of [[Jiminy Cricket]], as Jim Crow, the leader of the [[crow]]s. 

Completed in fall 1941, Disney's distributor [[RKO Radio Pictures]] initially balked at the film's 64-minute length and wanted Disney to either make it longer, edit it down to a [[short subject]] length, or allow them to release it as a [[B-movie]]. Disney refused all three options, and RKO reluctantly issued ''Dumbo'', unaltered, as an A-film.

==Release==
Despite the advent of [[World War II]], ''Dumbo'' was still the most financially successful Disney film of the 1940s. This was one of the first of Disney's [[animated film]]s to be broadcast, albeit severely edited, on [[television]], as part of Disney's [[Walt Disney anthology series|anthology series]]. The film then received another distinction of note in 1981, when it was the first of Disney's canon of [[animated film]]s to be released on [[home video]].

===Reception===
After its October 23 release, ''Dumbo'' proved to be a financial miracle compared to other Disney films. The simple film only cost $813,000 to produce, half the cost of ''Snow White'', less than a third of the cost of ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', and certainly less than the expensive ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]''.  ''Dumbo'' eventually grossed $1.6 million during its original release; it and ''Snow White'' were the only two pre-1943 Disney features to turn a profit.<ref>Barrier, 318</ref>  It was intended for Dumbo to be on the cover of the December 1941 issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', but the idea was dropped when the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor]], resulting in the [[United States]] entering [[World War II]] and reducing the box office draw of the film.

''Dumbo'' won the 1941 [[Academy Award for Original Music Score]], awarded to musical directors [[Frank Churchill]] and Oliver Wallace. Churchill and lyricist [[Ned Washington]] were also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Song]] for "''Baby Mine''" (the song that plays during Dumbo's visit to his mother's cell), but did not win for this category.<ref name="latimesblogs.latimes.com">{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/files/2009/02/snow-white-and.html |title=Animated films are unwelcome outside designated categories, as "WALL-E" and "Waltz" shutouts remind us |accessdate=September 30, 2009|work=latimesblogs.latimes.com}}</ref> The film also won Best Animation Design at the [[1947 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="festival-cannes.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/1947/awardCompetition.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Dumbo |accessdate=2009-01-04|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> Reviews for the film were generally positive and the film did well at the box office despite being released less than two months before the US entered [[World War II]]. The film was re-released in theaters in [[1949 in film|1949]], [[1959 in film|1959]], [[1972 in film|1972]], and [[1976 in film|1976]]. 

Now considered a Disney classic (movie critic [[Leonard Maltin]] described it as "One of Walt Disney's most charming animated films"),<ref>Maltin, Leonard. (2008). "Leonard Maltin's 2009 Movie Guide", p390. Plume.</ref> it has received a [[Disney Special Editions|Special Edition]] 60th Anniversary [[Disney DVD]] on October 23, 2001, exactly 60 years after its first release. That release featured a sneak peek of a [[direct-to-video]] sequel, ''Dumbo II''. The preview showed sketches and storyboard ideas. The main story has to do with Dumbo and his new friends getting separated from the rest of the circus as they wander into the big city. Dumbo's new friends are Claude and Lolly the twin bears who leave chaos everywhere they go, Dot the curious zebra, Godfrey the hippo who is older and wants to do things for himself, and Penny the adventurous ostrich. Timothy returns as well. The story was supposed to be set on the day immediately following the end of the first Dumbo story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/jmraises/other/otherdumboII.html |title=Dumbo II|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/jmraises/other/otherdumboII.html&date=2009-10-26+00:54:35|archivedate=2009-10-26}}</ref> However, no further announcements have been made since. The project seems to have been canceled, as ''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]'', ''[[Tinker Bell (film)|Tinker Bell]]'', and its sequels were the last projects for [[DisneyToon Studios]]. However, some of the backgrounds for the canceled sequel were recycled for ''[[The Fox and the Hound 2]]''.

===Allegations of racial stereotyping===
The crow characters in the film can be seen as [[African-American]] [[stereotype]]s. The leader crow was originally named "[[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]]" for script purposes, and the name stuck. The other crows are all voiced by African-American actors, all members of the Hall Johnson Choir. Despite suggestions of racism by critics such as [[Richard Schickel]] who have criticized the portrayal as racist,<ref>{{Citation|last=Schickel|first=Richard|title=The Disney Version|place=New York|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1968}}</ref> others reject these claims.<ref>{{Citation|last=Grant|first=John|title=Encyclopedia of Walt Disney's Animated Characters|place=New York|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1987|page=175}}</ref> Defenders note that the crows form the majority of the characters in the movie who are sympathetic to Dumbo's plight, are free spirits who serve nobody, and intelligent characters aware of the power of self-confidence, unlike the [[Stepin Fetchit]] stereotype common at that time. Furthermore, their song "When I See An Elephant Fly", which uses intricate wordplay in the lyrics, is more oriented to mocking Timothy Mouse than Dumbo's large ears.

===Home video release===
Dumbo was the first of Disney's canon of [[animated film]]s to be released on [[home video]] and also was released in the ''[[Walt Disney Classics]]'' Video Collection in 1985. That release was followed by remastered versions in: 1986, 1989, 1991 (Classics), and 1994 (Masterpiece). In 2001, a 60th Anniversary Special Edition was released. In 2006, a "Big Top Edition" of the film was released on DVD. A UK Special Edition was released in May 2007. Blu-ray version was released in 2010 in region [[DVD region code|2]]/[[Blu-ray Disc Region Code|B]]. Region 1/A version is scheduled for September 20, 2011.<ref>http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=6282</ref><ref>http://www.amazon.com/Dumbo-70th-Anniversary-Blu-ray-Herman/dp/B004YHRZLM/ref=sr_1_9?s=dvd&ie=UTF8&qid=1304133324&sr=1-9</ref>
