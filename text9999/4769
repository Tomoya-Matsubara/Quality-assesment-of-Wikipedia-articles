"'''God's Gonna Cut You Down'''", also known as "'''Run On'''", is a traditional [[American folk music|folk]] song which has been recorded by numerous artists representing a variety of genres. The lyrics are a warning to [[sin]]ners that no matter how hard they try, they will not avoid [[God]]'s judgment; in the [[refrain|chorus]], God tells the narrator of the song to
{{cquote|Go tell that long tongue liar,<br />
go and tell that midnight rider,<br />
tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter,<br />
tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down.}}

The song has, in the past, been modified to fit the boundaries of genres like [[Country music|country]], folk, [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[techno]]. As "God's Gonna Cut You Down", it was performed by [[Odetta]] on ''[[Odetta Sings Ballads and Blues]]'' (1956) and [[Johnny Cash]] on the posthumously released ''[[American V: A Hundred Highways]]'' (2006). As "Run On", it was recorded, among others, by [[Elvis Presley]]. A version incorporating sampled vocals by [[Bill Landford & The Landfordaires]] was included on [[Moby]]'s album ''[[Play (Moby album)|Play]]''. The [[Blind Boys of Alabama]] also included the song on their [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-winning album ''[[Spirit of the Century]]'' in 2001. In 2007, [[Kevin Max]] of [[dc Talk]] covered the song as "Run on for a Long Time" with [[Chris Sligh]].

===Music Video===

There are two music videos for the song:

===Video 1===
The first video involves Moby working at an office where everyone wears white. It then shows an earlier scene involving a workout instructor teaching a class when she passes out. Moby then comes in and puts an inhaler in her mouth. It then continues to show an earlier scene, going backwards to tell the entire story: the office Moby works in is [[heaven]], the instructor is self-conscious and not sure of her capabilities, and heaven is a self-help phone line. Eventually, it shows a scene of Moby dead in a parking lot, with another employee checking his pulse. It then concludes with a shot of Moby working in the same office, but it has a green light to it, and everyone is unkind and emotionally distant.

===Video 2===
The second music video involves an animated version of Moby's disembodied head floating through technicolor backgrounds, singing the song, with background voices provided by demons.

The song is presented with a rhythmic stomp-clap downbeat, grim and pessimistic in its portrayal of a vengeful and uncompromising God, serving as a warning to sinners.
