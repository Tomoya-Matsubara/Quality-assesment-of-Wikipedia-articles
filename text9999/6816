A '''foot-launched powered hang glider''' (FLPHG), also called powered harness, nanolight or hangmotor, is a powered [[hang gliding|hang glider]] harness with a [[internal combustion engine|motor]] and [[propeller]] in [[pusher configuration]]. An ordinary hang glider is used for the [[wing]] and the pilot can foot-launch from a hill or from flat ground, needing an area of about the size of a football field to get airborne, much less if there's oncoming breeze and absence of obstacles. Although their main appeal at the present time is to the already experienced hang glider pilot, interest in these machines is growing rapidly, particularly in areas where there are no hills to foot-launch from.

The pilot can cruise around in good weather at speeds of 40 to 72 km/h (25 to 45 mi/h), sightseeing, but powered harnesses have limited power and [[thrust]] so are best used as a self-launch device in order to achieve enough height to find a warm rising air [[thermal]] and [[soaring|soar]].

{{main|History of hang gliding}}

'''Summary''': Some glider flights have been recorded as early as the year 875<ref>[[Abbas Ibn Firnas]] flights in year 875 near [[Cordoba, Spain]]. ([[Ibn Firnas (crater)|Ibn Firnas crater]] on the Moon is named in his honor).</ref> but most early glider designs copied from birds did not fulfill target dreams; The problem was that early flight pioneers often copied bird wings without understanding the underlying principles that made the [[wing]] work. Starting in the 1880s technical and scientific advancements were made that led to the first truly practical [[glider]]s. [[Otto Lilienthal]] of [[Germany]] duplicated some of his contemporaries' work and greatly expanded on it from 1874. He rigorously documented his work, strongly influencing later designers; For this reason Lilienthal is one of the best known of the early aviation pioneers. His type of aircraft is now known as a [[hang glider]].

When the [[Wright brothers]] opened the secrets to sustained powered flight in 1903, pure glider research practically came to a halt, but starting in the 1920s the Germans began designing and flying ever more efficient gliders and discovering ways of using the natural forces in the atmosphere to make them fly farther and faster, undergoing a ''renaissance'' of gliding aviation. Some of these gliders were hang gliders in that they were controlled by the pilot's weight shift alone.<ref>Wasserkuppe, gliding [http://www.soaringissa.org/wasserkuppe/]</ref><ref> Glider history [http://www.glider-pilot.co.uk/Wings%20of%20%20Wasserkuppe/Wings%20of%20%20Wasserkuppe.htm]</ref>

On 1948 engineer [[Francis Rogallo]] invented a self-inflating wing which he patented on March 20, 1951 <ref>As an acknowledgement of his wife<U+2019>s enormous contribution to the project, Francis put the patent in his wife<U+2019>s name. Gertrude Rogallo holds the patent on the Flexible wing. This was not simply a tribute to Francis<U+2019> love for his wife, but the acknowledgement that she was a significant partner in his research. Gertrude Rogallo still holds the patent.</ref><ref>Article: How ''to Fly Without a Plane'' by Robert Zimmerman, aerospace writer. [http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1998/4/1998_4_22.shtml]</ref> as the ''flexible wing'' or [[Rogallo wing]] which in 1957 the American space agency [[NASA]] began testing in various flexible and semi-rigid configurations in order to evaluate it as a recovery system for the Gemini [[space capsule]]s and recovery of used Saturn [[Staged combustion cycle (rocket)|rocket stage]]s.<ref>SPACEFLIGHT REVOLUTION [http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4308/ch11.htm#382]</ref><ref>On 1965 [[Jack Swigert]], who would later be one of the [[Apollo 13]] astronauts, softly landed a full-scale Gemini capsule using a Para Wing stiffened with inflatable tubes along the wing<U+2019>s edges</ref><ref>NASA's [[Fleep]] was tested as a "flying Jeep" for transporting supplies and observation, this two-person aircraft used a small engine for power and Rogallo's wing for lift)[http://dayton.hq.nasa.gov/IMAGES/SMALL/GPN-2000-001271.jpg]</ref>
Flexible wing projects like the [[Paresev]], were stopped by NASA in 1965 in favor of round parachutes, but the wing's simplicity of design and ease of construction, along with its capability of slow flight and its gentle landing characteristics, did not go unnoticed by hang glider enthusiasts, who were already building and flying rigid wing hang gliders. Some designers rapidly adapted Rogallo's flexible wing onto elementary flexible wing hang gliders, but performance and control remained a challenge. A brakethrough took place on 1963 when Australian '''John Dickenson''' set to build a water ski glider that could be released at altitude for a glide to a safe landing. He called it the '''Ski Wing''' <ref>Ski Wing [http://grafton.nsw.free.fr/ski_wing/]</ref>; Although its gliding performance was not impressive, the effective innovations over existing manned kites and hang gliders were: lightweight, increased control and portability. Australian water ski kite fliers introduced Dickenson's innovations to the rest of the world, furthering the hang gliding boom in the 1970s.<ref>On October/11/1963 Dickenson filed for a patent, and a provisional protection was awarded for his application number 36189/63 but the patent was not finally awarded.</ref><ref>The Swallowtail hang glider was featured in the 1976 movie Sky Riders (filmed in Greece during 1975) starring James Coburn, Robert Culp, Susannah York, and Charles Aznavour. After filming of the action was complete, the Wills Wing team toured Europe and stopped by in England to win the British Championships at Mere, Wiltshire, in August 1975.</ref> Dickenson's adaptation and innovations soon produced a foldable hang glider that dramatically reduced difficulty in control, storage, transport, assembly and repair. Dickenson's adaptations were refined and brought to the world market by Austalian businessmen '''Bill Bennet''' and '''Bill Moyes''', who significantly improved hang gliding trends.

The reaction of most pilots would be to say that powered [[microlight]]s (ultralights) developed from hang gliding in the late 1970s, but it was not that simple. In fact, microlights are a rebirth, a return to the love of low-speed flight which the [[Aviation history|earliest aviators]] felt so keenly, but which was subsequently lost in the quest for [[military]] superiority.<ref>In 1898 [[Augustus Moore Herring]] adapted a compressed air engine to a weight-shift biplane. Images: [http://www.flyingmachines.org/hrrg.html]</ref> For second time in aviation history, during the 1970s, motorization of simple gliders, especially those portable and foot-launched, became an obsession of many inventors and gradually, small wing-mounted power packs were adapted. These early experiments went largely unrecorded, even in log books, let alone the [[publishing|press]], because the pioneers were uncomfortably aware that the addition of an engine made the craft liable to registration, airworthiness legislation, and the pilot liable to expensive licensing and probably, insurance. Inventors from [[Australia]], [[France]] and [[England]] produced several successful microlight [[motor glider]]s in the early 1970s <ref>French aviation historians on FLPHG: [http://perso.orange.fr/pulma1/Un%20peu%20d'histoire.htm]</ref> but very few were portable flexible wings. Surprisingly, what really launched the powered [[ultralight aviation]] movement in the [[USA]] did not use the Rogallo flexible wing but were a whole series of rigid wing motorized hang gliders.<ref>British Microlight Aircraft Association, History of Microlighting [http://www.bmaa.org/histdets.asp?HistoryID=4]</ref> The ''Icarus V'' flying wing appeared with its tip rudders and swept-back style wing - a rigid biplane designed by genius teen-ager [[Taras Kiceniuk, Jr]], while Larry Mauro's ''Easy Riser'' biplane started to sell in large numbers. Hang gliding record holder Don Mitchell <ref> In April of 1946 Mitchell completed construction of his 'Flying Wing' (not the ''Mitchell Wing'' hang glider which was developed in 1975). The American [[FAA]] issued an Experimental Airworthiness number for it. The wing was flown as a glider by Mitchell, Bolwus and Paul Tuntland. Then Mitchell mounted a Nelson 2-cycle engine on it and flew it as a powered glider with wheels for landing gear.[http://home.earthlink.net/~mitchellwing/mitchell.html]</ref> fitted his BF-10 <ref>In the early 1940s Don Mitchell first became involved with flying wing glider design and construction. But [[World War II|WWII]] interrupted his research and experiments. Then in 1974, with the advent of hang glider mania, the Mitchell Wing resurfaced. It was at that time Dr. Howard Long took an interest in the half-forgotten project and asked Mitchell to make him a flying wing hang glider. The result was the foot-launched Mitchell Wing, controllable by a 'joystick'. The Mitchell Wing astounded the world of hang gliding. George Worthington, holder of eight world records in hang gliding and author of the book ''In Search of World Records'', wrote in the book..."I predict that the Mitchell Wing will be the highest performance foot-launhced hang glider we'll see for a long time." He was right and it was from this preliminary design that Mitchell developed his later powered models: The B-10 and [[Mitchell U-2 Superwing]].</ref> with a motor, though he still used the pilot's legs as undercarriage, an arrangement which persisted until his ''B-10 Mitchell Wing'' <ref>Don Mitchell - U.S. Pacific [http://home.earthlink.net/~mitchellwing/mitchell.html], B-10 Photos: [http://home.earthlink.net/~mitchellwing/b10pics.html]</ref> appeared. Then there was the ''Manta Fledge IIB'', the ''Pterodactyl'' series, and the [[Quicksilver (aircraft)|Quicksilver]] created in 1972 by Bob Lovejoy. But foot-launched powered hang gliding -as we know it today- had been unsuccessful prior to 1976 because three basic elements were unrefined:

*Most hang gliders had poor performance.<ref>Flex-wing hang glider technology underwent a performance jump in 1980, when ''Ultralight Products'' released the revolutionary ''Comet'' hang glider.</ref>
*Small engine technology was underpowered and unreliable.
*Piloting skills and experience were limited.

In 1963 during his free time, aeronaultical engineer [[Barry Hill Palmer|Barry Palmer]] built and experimented with a foot-launched powered hang glider at [[Bloomfield, Connecticut]]. It was powered by a {{Auto hp|7|0}} [[West Bend Company|West Bend]] engine and mounted on top of a Rogallo-type flexible wing hang glider; The propeller was {{convert|3|ft|m|0}} in diameter and was made of [[balsa]] wood, covered with [[fiberglass]] and mounted in pusher configuration. But the engine was quite underpowered and the craft could not achieve flight,<ref>Interview with Gerard Farell on Jan. 23-24, 2007. "Foot launched powered Para-wing around 1963, {{Auto hp|7|0}} West Bend driving a {{convert|3|ft|m|0|sing=on}} dia. glass over balsa propeller. Main structure is 6061-T6 aluminum tubing, 4 mil polyethylene. The craft was not particularly portable, the wind was always coming down the slight slope in Bloomfield, CT, and the project was terminated as I was re-engineering it with a bigger engine and as I got a job offer to move to Miami and design, build and fly the wheeled wings ([[Ultralight Trikes|trikes]])."</ref> It is now estimated that a modern flexible [[Rogallo wing]] hang glider requires at least {{Auto hp|6|0}} at the prop shaft and about 45 lbf (200 N) of thrust just to maintain level flight. [[Barry Hill Palmer|Barry Palmer]] build during 1967 what is likely the first weight-shift powered [[Ultralight Trikes|trike]] aircraft.<ref>Recorded by the [[FAA]] as: [[Ultralight trike#First trikes|Palmer Parawing D-6]], serial 1A, N7144, was registered on 4/24/1967. No limitations were noted.</ref>

In 1973, Australian Bill Bennett, who was one of the most skilled pilots of the time and the largest U.S. [[hang glider]] manufacturer, was following in Barry Palmer's footsteps and attempting to motorize a flexible hang glider. Bennett built a McCulloch engine backpack that drove a small caged propeller. It did not, however, work particularly well, as the prop was almost completely masked by his back, and what little efficiency remained was further reduced by the thick wire guard with which Bennett was prudent enough to surround the propeller. In practice, when used with the best hang glider of the day, it was nothing more than a glide extender.
In the late 1970s, light [[Two-stroke cycle|two-stroke engines]] started to become more powerful and reliable and [[hang glider]] pilots were developing their skills to such an extent that they no longer considered it normal to crash each time they flew. The only unanswered questions were where to fit the engine, the size and pitch of the propeller and how it was driven.

On March/15/1975 '''John Moody''' successfully added a 12.5 hp [[West Bend Company|West Bend]] engine with a 71 cm (28") propeller to an ''Easy Riser'' biplane hang glider designed by Larry Mauro. Moody opened the throttle and ran until he lifted from the frozen surface of a [[lake]] west of [[Racine, Wisconsin]] and he flew for 30 minutes. Then on July/27/1976 John Moody demonstrated<ref>Article in PDF format: ''Powered hang glider, you can launch it any where '' [http://www.pioneerflyer.com/articles/ps-article.pdf]</ref> ultralight aviation at the annual [[Experimental Aircraft Association|EAA]] fly-in convention in [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]] with a foot launched [[McCulloch (company)|McCulloch]] 101 powered ''Icarus II'' <ref> Smithsonian Air & Space Museum. Icarus hang glider development.[http://www.nasm.si.edu/research/aero/aircraft/icarus.htm]</ref> in front of thousands of aviation-loving spectators, starting the modern [[ultralight aviation]] revolution in the [[USA]]. Later he added wheels to the aircraft and by the end of 1979, there were almost 100 competing companies selling powered ultralights (microlights) but very few were foot-launchable.

During the mid 1970s in [[England]], Steve Hunt experimented by fitting a Scorpion glider with a [[McCulloch (company)|McCulloch]] [[chainsaw]] engine driving a keel-mounted [[ducted fan]] via a reduction gear unit, but he stopped development "because it was too heavy". However, he visualized the need for a [[clutch]] unit to facilitate starting and to reduce shock loading on the drive system. Meanwhile, powered hang glider flight was progressing in the [[United States]] and in 1977 the Soarmaster company located in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], produced the first commercial foot-launched powered hang glider, the '''Soarmaster'''. The unit was recommended for fitting on an ''Electra Flyer Cirrus'' or ''Olympus'' hang glider, as the mounting brackets and thrust line calculations had been done for these two gliders only. The Soarmaster company had developed a two-stroke engine unit with splash box lubricated chain reduction system, clutch and long drive-shaft that bolted just below the hang glider keel. It produced about {{Auto hp|10|0}} for about of 80 lbf (360 N) of static thrust and sustained climb rate as high as 150 ft/min (0.762 m/s). The keel-mounted transmission rendered the aircraft pitch unstable under power so a fine balance existed between applying too much power, causing the aircraft to overtake the pilot or not enough power for [[flight]]. Though marginal and difficult to fly, the Soarmaster was an encouraging development, until strange accidents began to happen; When the pilot pushed out, propeller-related injuries to their feet ensued, earning it nicknames such as ''ToeMaster'' and ''SawMaster''. It turned out that when the pilot went weightless or [[Stall (flight)|stalled]] under power, the glider would tuck forward violently because the line of [[thrust]] was well above the [[Center of mass|centre of gravity]].

In 1979 a powered backpack called '''Motolotnia - White Eagle'''<ref> Power Up Company, United States Patent # 4546938 [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4546938.html]</ref><ref>Powered backpack Motolotnia 80 White Eagle photo of advert in ''Flight Line'' magazine, march-June 1982 [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Motolotnia80_Backpack.jpg]</ref> designed by Jerzy Kolecki (Kolecki New Aviation Engineering, [[Sweden]]) became available for sale. It consisted of a 90 cc McCulloch [[chainsaw]] engine with a direct drive 61 cm (24") wooden prop, producing a quoted 77 lbf (340 N) of thrust; The rate of climb was about {{convert|150|ft|m|0}}/minute and flight duration was limited by the small fuel tank and engine overheating after several minutes. 
Other powered harnesses to reach the market in the 1980s were '''The Ranger'''<ref>The Ranger, designed by Bruce Hudson, UK. Powered by the Solo 210 cc engine: [http://perso.orange.fr/pulma1/Un%20peu%20d'histoire.htm]</ref> and the '''Relax 220'''. <ref>Relax 220, designed by [[Yves Rousseau]].</ref>

The first truly successful foot-launched powered harness was the '''Mosquito'''. It did not have a keel-mounted motor, but the complete power unit was incorporated in the harness' frame. The harness was hooked on to the glider by a regular hang strap, placing the [[center of mass]] well below the keel, the ideal position for effective weight-shift control and thrust transmission. The Mosquito was designed and produced by [[Sweden|Swedish]] inventor Johan <U+00C5>hling (Swedish AeroSport). <U+00C5>hling's Mosquito flew first in 1987, but it had only 10 [[horsepower]] and a few problems had to be worked out. When the Mosquito was released again in 1990 with a reliable 15 hp (10.2 kg, 118 cc) [[Kart racing|go-kart]] engine <ref>Radne Raket 120, 118 cc, {{Auto hp|15|0}}, 10.2 kg + exhaust and reduction drive[http://www.radne.se/Store/Product/ProductList.aspx?CategoryID=24&N=9.1]</ref> its appeal grew first amongst [[Europe]]an and [[Australia]]n hang glider pilots, and it was not until the late 1990s that the Mosquito started to become somewhat popular in [[North America]], that by then, was obsessed with larger and heavier ultralights and undergoing a decreasing hang glider pilot population. <U+00C5>hling's Mosquito was later redesigned and released in 2000 as the '''NRG'''.

As of 2008, there are a few harness designs similar to the Mosquito/NRG, each sporting unique strengths, and produced by other FLPHG manufacturers.<ref>FLPHG manufacturers: [http://www.wind-drifter.com/manuf.htm]</ref> The latest generation of powered harnesses bear names such as '''Wasp''' ,<ref>Wasp designers: Ed Cleasby and Chris Taylor - Wasp Flight Systems and Sperwill.</ref> '''DoodleBug''',<ref>DoodleBug designer: Ben Ashman - Flylight Airsports Ltd.</ref> '''Raven''',<ref>Raven designer: Randy Haney - Powerplanes</ref> '''X1''',<ref>X1 designers: Kenneth M.

Created in 1997; Discontinued in 2004 and released again in 2007 as the 'Explorer LD'</ref> and '''Fillo'''.<ref>Fillo manufacturer: Milan Vita.</ref> 

On April/30/2003, a modified DoodleBug named 'JetBug' took to the skies over [[England]] while powered by a 95 pounds force (420 N) thrust gasoline [[Jet engine|turbine]] engine. The JetBug was produced in collaboration between Flylight Airsports Ltd. and MicroJet Engineering; It was piloted first by Ben Ashman and then by Stewart Bond. Its flight autonomy was only of ten minutes at 1 Liter/min. The JetBug is an occasional guest at [[air show]]s across [[England]].

Such records by the Medium Ropuleim do not reflect in any way the performance of true foot-launched powered hang gliders, with a total aircraft & fuel weight limited by a pilot's strength to lift it, run and land on his/her feet. A review of the RWF1 category, past records and their logical classification are in order.

==Configurations==
Currently, there are two harness configurations: [[Prone position|prone]] (face down) and [[Supine position|supine]] (sitting). Both configurations allow the pilot to takeoff and land on his/her feet.

==Construction==
[[Image:X1 FLPHG.jpg|thumb|200px|right|FLPHG with a folding propeller.]]
Foot-launched powered hang glider (FLPHG) harnesses are built around a light metal frame with the engine and propeller mounted on the rear in a [[pusher configuration]]. Current powered harnesses weigh 22-32 kg (50-70 lb) not including the safety [[parachute]] and fuel, and fold neatly into a 1.5 m (5 ft) long harness bag with a handle. Most powered harnesses in production are equipped with the 'Radne Raket 120' [[two stroke]] engine which is based on [[Husqvarna]] XP3120 [[chainsaw]] parts. It has a displacement of 118 cm<U+00B3> (7.2 in<U+00B3>) and produces about {{Auto hp|15|0}} at 8900 [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] if equipped with a [[expansion chamber|tuned exhaust]]; When coupled to a 1:3.5 belt-driven [[reduction drive]] and a 52" x 22" propeller, it produces about 100 lbf (440 N) of static [[thrust]]. For heavy pilots or pilots operating from higher than 5000 ft (1500 m) MSL fields, a powered harness equipped with an {{Auto hp|18|0}} engine is recommended.<ref>18 hp Harnesses such as the 'X1' or 'Wasp Venom' equipped with the Vittorazi EVO 100 cc for about 130 lbf (580 N) thrust at {{convert|7000|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}} MSL</ref> It is now estimated that a modern flex wing hang glider requires of at least {{Auto hp|6|0}} at the propeller and about 30 or 40 lb of thrust to maintain level flight at 'best glide' speed.

The motor is supported on the ground by two retractable [[undercarriage|landing gear]] skids, holding the propeller just off the ground. The 4 Liter [[aerodynamic]] fuel tank is attached to the top of the control frame or enclosed in the harness. Getting into the harness requires passing both legs through padded straps and wearing the harness like a vest, with a [[zipper]] and/or [[buckle]]s at the front. The powered harness is hooked to the glider via a regular hang strap. The whole aircraft is easily maneuvered on the ground into takeoff position with the pilot buckled into the harness and ready to start the unit by themselves either with a manual or with an electric starter. The [[throttle]] is activated during takeoff by means of a mouth-throttle in order to have both hands free for proper weight-shift control. Once airborne, a foot throttle, thumb throttle or [[cruise control]] can be used. Zipping up the harness also retract the rear skids, which are then clipped into clamps on the side of the harness. The propeller is locked in place while soaring power off, as a wind milling propeller has more [[Drag (physics)|drag]] than a stationary one: Expect a 10 to 20% decrease in glide performance with a wind milling propeller (clutched units) and 2 to 4% decrease with a locked propeller. A folding propeller is often preferred by pilots who enjoy optimum [[soaring]] and cross country performance with the engine turned off. 

'''Engine controls''' - Hang gliders are controlled by simply shifting the pilot's weight, but a powered harness must have engine controls and the pilot must know exactly where they are, without having to look and find them. Engine controls are [[ergonomics|ergonomically]] positioned at the sides of the harness, chest or shoulder straps and generally consist of throttle, choke, propeller lock, recoil starter handle or electric starter button and decompression valve. During training, it is very important to hang the harness from a solid location, climb in and practice often so that the pilot can automatically reach and activate any engine control without first looking at it.

Hang gliding is an [[extreme sport]] but perhaps often viewed as a higher-risk sport than it actually is. Nonetheless, there is great potential for injury for the reckless or ill-prepared. Unlike [[powered paragliding]], it is absolutely [[essence|essential]] that the aspiring pilot first take lessons in an unpowered [[hang glider]] at a certified school and achieve some solo experience in order to develop all needed skills to perform automatic control inputs and consistently safe landings. Tow is the best launch method for progression to FLPHG. Basic [[aerodynamics]], [[flight]] concepts, some [[meteorology]], local [[regulation]]s, field choice, [[safety]] and emergency procedures must also be learned during training.<ref>British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association Ltd. - [http://www.bhpa.co.uk/members/documents/FLPA_Training_Syllabus.pdf FOOT LAUNCHED POWERED AIRCRAFT (FLPA) TRAINING SYLLABUS - POWERED HANG GLIDING]</ref> 

It is sometimes said that the factor which most affects safety is pilot attitude. A large proportion of accidents involve over-confident novices failing to heed advice, or pilots flying beyond their limits. Flying often can keep the pilots' skills current.
A major safety consideration is simply having a large enough field that is free of obstructions. The pilot must not assume about how fast he will climb or that the engine will not quit. The pilot needs to have a way to safely turn or land at all times during every flight.

Safety precautions include: Certified training, equipment maintenance, pre-flight checks of glider and harness systems, helmet, safety [[wheel]]s at the lower end of the control frame, [[helmet]], a hook-knife (for cutting their parachute bridle after impact or cutting their harness lines and straps in case of a tree or water landing), and a special emergency [[parachute]] (Note that unlike [[Parachuting|skydiving]] reserve parachutes in which the main canopy is cut away before deployment, [[hang gliding]] & [[paragliding]] reserves are designed to open at low speeds and deploy with the glider still attached to the pilot.) 
Water, knee pads, gloves a [[mobile phone]] and/or a transceiver [[radio]] are also desired.

==Flying==

{{Quotation|'''Important:'''  The highlights below are not meant to replace a comprehensive certified training course but to simply give the reader an idea of the skill development required for an already experienced hang glider pilot to transition to a powered harness and of the general control input.}} 

=== Takeoff ===
[[Image:BadTakeoff.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Common takeoff '''mistakes''': 1) The pilot quit running before establishing climb and, 2) He is pushing on the control bar while still at low speed, generating too much drag to accelerate and climb.]][[Image:Hang strap.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Takeoff run: the pilot must lean forward and must avoid pushing the control frame.]]

Launching and landing are done into [[wind]]. Though it is possible to launch and land in nil wind, a steady 8 km/h (5 miles/h) breeze is ideal. A successful takeoff depends mostly on level wings, speed and precise control of the angle of attack: Too low the angle and the glider will simply not fly. If it is too high it will create excessive [[drag]] and will never get the speed it needs to fly and climb.

A committed and fast run is required with a smooth control of pitch angle throughout the run, similar to a shallow slope launch (see: aborting a takeoff). The pilot remains upright throughout the run, allowing forward acceleration to be gradually provided by the thrust so, the pilot does not use his legs to accelerate but only to carry the weight of him and the glider. By gradually increasing thrust the pilot has time to counter the pitch-up moment introduced by the thrust with an appropriate counter pitch-down control movement. The pilot runs as long as necessary, taking strides of ever increasing length ('moon walking') and during the last steps most of the pilot<U+2019>s weight will be carried by the glider. There must be no noticeable change in pitch angle, and ''the pilot will have stopped running only after the last steps no longer touch the ground''.

Failure to remain upright throughout the takeoff run is one of the main problems that experienced mountain glider pilots suffer, as their normal tendency is to move towards prone position as soon as they feel the glider lifting. But on a flat ground powered takeoff one do not have the hill dropping away to help achieve flying speed - ''the pilot must keep running up until he is firmly established in a climb''. What can often make the difference between a successful takeoff and settling back to Earth are those last long 'moon walking' steps.

During the takeoff run, the [[thrust]] must be transmitted to the glider through the hang strap and not through the pilot's hands to the control frame. By the time the glider comes off the pilot's shoulders, he must '''pull in''' and move his upper body forward through the control frame so that the hang strap becomes tight and is angled slightly forward and the harness is pulling the glider forward by the hang strap, all while he is still upright and running. Because the thrust force enters the glider right at the hang point, it only requires of a light touch to control the pitch. During takeoff, particularly if something has started to go wrong, a fierce grip of the down tubes may cause the engine torque to be transmitted through the pilot to the glider. A tight grip can induce a roll which may require a rapid decision to abort the takeoff. A light touch on the control bar at all times can help to avoid this. '''Pull in''' and allow the glider to fly on [[Wing In Ground|ground effect]] for as long as possible in order to accelerate - the glider will climb on its own once it has the speed to do so; Use of a speed bar helps to '''pull in''' more effectively at this stage. '''Resist the temptation to push out'''. Shortly after lift-off, many gliders will suddenly climb too fast - be prepared for this, '''pull in''', and you will avoid a stall. The overall sensation and glider behavior is similar to that of being [http://www.questairforce.com/aero.html aero towed] or winch towed. A powered launch is easier to do well if you allow the glider to achieve flight from the trim position - so you want to make sure this glider trim speed is fast enough for safety. If you are trimmed exactly at minimum sink (very close to mush/stall) then it would be advisable to move the hang point forward to where you have good roll response and control authority without pulling in (when gliding power off). Setting the trim speed higher will mean you have to run a bit faster, but when you do get airborne it will be at a safer airspeed and there will be less drag for the motor to overcome.

===Aborting a takeoff===

Aborting a takeoff is an important procedure and experienced mountain glider pilots must note that this is an option for every powered takeoff. Unlike a mountain launch where your best bet is usually to continue once begun, significant sorrow and money can be saved by aborting a powered harness takeoff if things are not going exactly right. To abort a takeoff do not just stop running; Between yourself, the glider and the harness you will have a lot of momentum. First release the throttle while you continue running, then the drag of the harness' skids will help you to bleed off the momentum that both you and the glider have achieved, sense the speed and flare to a stop. If that fails, settle the glider on its safety wheels while pushing out the control bar and roll to a stop, then hit the kill switch. 

Learning to let go of the mouth-throttle is '''''critical'''''. When things start to go wrong, the general tendency is to clench up our jaws, which compounds the problem with unwanted thrust; Letting go of the mouth-throttle is the equivalent of tow line release and must be done without hesitation when needed. It is very useful to practice releasing the mouth-throttle while under stress by using dynamic [[mental image]].

=== Climb and cruise speeds === 
[[Image:NRG PHG.jpg|thumb|150px|Powered harness on climb at full power. Salinas, [[Baja California]], Mexico.]]
[[Image:FLPHG climb.jpg|thumb|150px|Low nose pitch and high speed is best for climb. ''Andy Buchan'']] 

* '''Climb speed'''
In general, the pilot must use '''best glide speed''' for takeoff and climb. The pilot '''must not push out on takeoff or climb'''. Note that the glider will climb on increased speed. Using full VG from a safe height is beneficial to climb rate. Many pilots new to powered flying make this common error, they are tempted to 'push-out' on climb but that causes to fly too slowly. To an observer on the ground they appear to wobble around and lose directional control; To the pilot there is a feeling that the glider wants to wind into turns and the wing feels unstable. The cause is a lack of [[airspeed]]. Pushing out will decrease airspeed -just as when free hang gliding- and the wing may [[Stall (flight)|stall]]. Even if it doesn't, it will certainly exhibit those nasty characteristics of slow speed [[flight]] - dropping a wing into turns and feeling unstable in roll, in short, the pilot will be in <U+201C>mush mode<U+201D> with very poor control authority.

As soon as it is safe, the pilot gets the feet into the harness for stability (or [[supine]] position if flying the DoodleBug). One must keep the wings level at all times, keep the control bar '''pulled in''' and be ready to correct any roll early on. Again, note that the best rate of climb occurs at higher [[airspeed]] and that most flexible wings climb well at {{convert|10|mi|km|0}}/h above their [[stall speed]]! Today's powered harnesses develop a maximum of 45 kg (100 lb) of static [[thrust]], but the [[rate of climb]] also depends on weather conditions such as field [[altitude]], air [[temperature]], [[humidity]], etc., and on glider size and [[wing loading]]. The harness' thrust is adequate for a sustained 200 - 300 ft/min (1.0 - 1.5 m/s) [[rate of climb]] at full power even when flying at [[airspeed]]s well above [[Polar curve (aviation)|minimum sink]]. If a powered harness experience an engine failure when climbing steeply, the aircraft will lose a lot of height before recovering; Climbing at a flatter angle and at a faster airspeed makes recovery easier and safer. 

* '''Cruise Speed'''
Cruise speed varies between hang glider brand, model, size and wing loading. To cruise fast and level while under power, pilots apply about 75% throttle (~ 6600 rpm for the Raket 120) and increasingly pull in while glancing at the [[variometer]] until top speed is achieved without descending. Flight autonomy with 4 Liters (aprox. 1 Gallon) of fuel depends on [[throttle]] settings, but it ranges between 60 and 90 minutes of continuous engine use.

=== Control bar position ===
Adding the motor weight behind one's feet in a prone configuration unit, moves the combined center of gravity lower on the pilot's body. Because the pilot is now located farther forward in relation to the hang point, the control bar will appear to be further back by about 25 cm (10 inches). This apparent bar trim position change occurs without the addition of power. Note that the actual trim characteristics of the glider have not changed, only the pilot's position with respect to the control bar. Though this new bar position may be disconcerting to experienced hang glider pilots, it should be clear that the pilot must rely instead on feeling the bar pressure and remain aware of airspeed at all times. With more experience, the new powered pilot will learn the new bar positions and use them automatically when flying the powered harness. Replacing the base tube for a 'speed bar' is quite recommended.

=== Turns ===
Even very experienced hang glider pilots will need to learn some new tricks when it comes to turning under power. Most hang glider pilots were taught to 'lead with your feet' in making turns. This is effective for un-powered flight, but adding weight and thrust to our feet changes things. Note that full power turns will become increasingly unstable with increasing roll angle so once the glider gains enough altitude, most pilots reduce the throttle for easier control during turns, especially on the early training stage. 

* '''Power on''' - Ideally, keep the harness (and thrust line) parallel with the [[keel]] of the wing so that the thrust pushes forwards and not sideways; Some pilots simply yaw their body momentarily as that changes the thrust line and helps engage a turn. Most pilots use a combination of both weight-shift and thrust line to turn under power. Novice FLPHG pilots must not attempt powered turns at low altitude. Medium power and shallow bank turns at a safe height are recommended for the first few flights so that the new FLPHG pilot can get a feel for the effects of thrust on glider behavior. If the glider enters a powered 'lockout' simply reduce the power and stabilize the wing as usual. Shallow and medium bank turns must be well coordinated to prevent the engine from 'falling' toward the lower side and engaging the glider on a diving turn.

* '''Power off''' - Turns in a prone unit hooked to a flex wing, require of a somewhat additional effort to weight-shift the center of gravity; Because of the engine mass, some experienced pilots new to powered harnesses find that only the front half of their body moves, that is: they cross-control without an effective shift of their center of gravity. Keeping the body parallel to the keel for turns or corrections is easier than weight-shifting one's feet. Shallow and medium bank turns must be well coordinated to prevent the engine from 'falling' toward the lower side and engaging the glider on a diving turn.
 [[Image:Doodlebug.jpg|thumb|right|150px|DoodleBug.]]
* '''Limit Lines''' - The DoodleBug is a supine unit that uses limit lines at the rear to keep the engine & propeller relatively stationary; The port line is approx. 1 inch shorter than the starboard line, and are secured to the lower wing wire tangs so that sideways movement of the harness is restricted to 4 inches approximately on each side of dead centre. As the pilot moves to one side, this arrangement moves the thrust line so that it actually pushes in the turn direction. It is evident that this setup is beneficial in helping to create a more coordinated turn and also in stability while flying through turbulence. Some pilots flying prone configuration units like the freedom of being able to control the direction of thrust as it gives them another way to fine tune a turn. Prone configuration units do not require of limit lines but they are recommended during the early training stages. Limit lines may also offer help when moderate thermal turbulence is expected as they help prevent the engine from 'falling' toward the lower side of the turn or provoke oscillations. On the ground, the limit lines might also prevent propeller strikes to the trailing edge of the wing.

=== Landing ===
[[Image:FLPHG approach.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Pilot semi-upright with one leg in the harness' boot for stability during final approach.]]
As usual, the pilot must plan the landing approach and execute it as planned in order to avoid sharp turns or sudden changes in [[aircraft attitude]]s. The FLPHG pilot must get ready at higher altitude than usual in order to set a landing configuration: turn off the engine (optional), lock the propeller, the harness' legs have to be un-clipped and the harness unzipped, and it is a little more work than a normal pod harness, definitely not something to be trying to do on final. The engine may be left on idle (if equipped with a centrifugal clutch) during final glide and if the pilot decides to abort the landing, then the propeller brake is released and the mouth throttle activated.

But the landings are surprisingly easy: keep the speed up as usual and keep one leg straight and snug in the harness' boot for as long as possible to prevent the motor from swinging sideways. Bleed off speed on [[ground effect]] and when you feel the harness' legs dragging, wait for the flare window appropriate for the glider and [[flare]] mildly. Your forward position and extra [[mass]] give you more flare authority than you are used to. The mass of the motor still wants to continue forward, so expect a feeling like a nudge from behind after you have landed, and be prepared to take a step or two.

Alternatively, running out the landing is possible as the rear skids generate enough drag against the ground to slow down the aircraft.

== Soaring ==
Although it started out as simply gliding down small hills on low performance wings, hang gliding over the last 120 years has evolved to the ability to soar for hours with hawks and eagles, gain thousands of feet of altitude in thermal updrafts, and fly cross country over distances of hundreds of miles. If the pilot finds lift, he/she may wish to shut off the engine and soar. While soaring, the propeller is locked or folded to reduce [[Parasitic drag|drag]]. In-flight engine restarts can be a powerful didactic tool for learning or improving thermalling skills, as the pilot does not have to land every time he does an incorrect decision and loses the lift. This brings about significant increase in soaring airtime and opportunities needed to better understand lift, usable cloud life, sink, drift, [[Slope soaring|ridge lift]], timing transition glides, etc.

While soaring a prone unit power off, the biggest difference will be the extra mass at one's feet when roll for a turn, which requires of additional effort at stabilizing the wing during mild or moderate [[turbulence]]. Unpowered glider pilots can stay airborne for hours. This is possible because they seek out rising air masses (lift) from the following sources:

====Thermals====
The most commonly used source of lift is created by the sun's energy heating the ground which in turn heats the air above it. This warm air rises in columns known as [[thermals]]. Soaring pilots quickly become aware of visual indications of [[thermals]] such as: [[cumulus cloud|cumulus]] clouds, cloud streets, dust devils, soaring birds and haze domes. Having located a thermal, a glider pilot will circle within the area of rising air to gain height. In the case of a cloud street, thermals can line up with the wind creating rows of thermals and sinking air. A pilot can use a cloud street to fly long straightline distances by remaining in the row of rising air.

====Ridge lift====
Another form of lift occurs when the wind meets a mountain, cliff or hill. The air is deflected up the [[windward]] face of the mountain forming lift. Gliders can "surf" and climb in this rising air by flying along the feature. Another name for flying with ridge lift is [[slope soaring]].

====Mountain wave====
The third main type of lift used by glider pilots are the [[lee waves]] that occur near mountains. The obstruction to the airflow can generate [[standing wave]]s with alternating areas of lift and sink. The top of each wave peak is often marked by [[lenticular cloud]] formations.

====Convergence====
Another form of lift results from the [[convergence]] of air masses, as with a [[Sea breeze|sea-breeze front]].

More exotic forms of lift are the polar vortexes which the [[Perlan Project]] hopes to use to soar to great altitudes. <ref>Pelan project [http://perlanproject.com]</ref> A rare phenomenon known as [[Morning glory cloud|Morning Glory]] has also been used by glider pilots in Australia.<ref> [http://www.dropbears.com/brough/index.html A Guide to the Morning Glory] at www.dropbears.com</ref>

== Hang Glider Selection ==
An ideal glider would be an intermediate model that has a low [[stall speed]], easy handling, good penetration and of the correct size. Consider that by adding about 40 lb to the hook-in weight, the free flying [[stall speed]] is increased by about 7% or 8% so a glider of appropriate size (hook in weight range) should be used. For first glider, the best choices are [[History of flexible wing hang gliding|flexible glider]]s with single surface (novice) because of their low [[stall speed]], ease of landing and gentle handling characteristics. Examples: Falcon II, Mark IV, Pulse, Eagle and Target, to name a few (2006).

* Low [[stall speed]] - very important, especially for a beginner to FLPHG. Lower takeoff speeds are safer and less intimidating. Also good for higher altitudes. 
* Easy Handling/Roll Stable - roll stability is important, especially for a beginner. A spirally unstable glider (some high performance gliders have been tuned that way to help initiate turns into thermals) will be more of a challenge while climbing under power.
* Good L/D (Lift/Drag ratio) - for maximum climb rate and best [[glide ratio]]. A fast rigid wing will climb better than a floater. Good L/D is useful to pilots who enjoy soaring cross-country power off.
* Short to moderate root chord - for propeller clearance. All powered harnesses require the glider keel to be cut be cut off no further than 119 cm (47 inches) behind the hang point; The cut off section can be sleeved and refitted to help rig the wing. 

Medium and high performance flexible hang gliders may also be used but only by well experienced pilots. Most "rigid wing" hang gliders such as the Exxtacy, Axxess and ATOS accept the powered harness readily. Some pilots believe the Exxtacy to be the ultimate hang glider for flying with a powered harness because of its docility, their high wing loading, penetration, ease of control with minimum weight-shift and the advantage of [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]], making the landings much easier.

== Instruments ==
In order to maximize a pilot's understanding of how the hang glider is flying, most pilots carry a series of small instruments, often interconnected. The most basic being an airspeed indicator, a variometer and altimeter. Many pilots also use two-way communication radios and some also carry a map and/or GPS unit. Some pilots also make use of a small [[tachometer]] to ensure the engine is developing full power prior to takeoff. Hang gliders do not have instrument panels as such, so all the instruments are mounted on the control frame of the glider, except for the radio and tachometer which are mounted on the harness.

=== Variometer ===
[[Image:Gleitschirmvario.jpg|100px|right|thumb|Vario-altimeter]]
People can sense the [[acceleration]] when they first enter a rising thermal, but they cannot detect the difference between constant rising air and constant sinking air, so they turn to technology for help. A [[variometer]] is a very sensitive vertical speed indicator; in other words, indicates climb or sink rate with audio signals (beeps) and/or a visual display. These units are generally electronic, vary in sophistication and often include, an [[altimeter]] and airspeed indicator. More advanced units often incorporate a [[barograph]] for recording flight data and/or a built in GPS. The main purpose of a variometer is in helping a pilot find and stay in the <U+2018>core<U+2019> of a thermal to maximise height gain, and conversely indicating when he or she is in sinking air, and needs to find rising air.
Variometers are sometimes capable of electronic calculations based on the 'MacCready Ring' to indicate the optimal speed to fly for given conditions. The MacCready theory solves the problem of how fast a pilot should cruise between thermals, given both the average lift the pilot expects in the next thermal climb, as well as the amount of lift or sink he encounters in cruise mode. Some electronic variometers make the calculations automatically, after allowing for factors such as the glider's theoretical performance (glide ratio), altitude, hook in weight and wind direction.

[[Image:2m band handheld transceiver.jpg|75px|left|thumb|2 meter band radio]]

=== Radio ===
Pilots use radio for training purposes and when traveling on cross-country flights. Radios used are PTT ([[push-to-talk]]) [[transceiver]]s. Best range is achieved with FM VHF [[2 meters|2-meter band]] (144<U+2013>148 MHz) radios. Usually a microphone and earphones are incorporated in the helmet and the PTT switch is strapped to a finger.

=== GPS ===
[[GPS]] (global positioning system) is a necessary navigation accessory when flying competitions, where it has to be demonstrated that [[waypoint|way-points]] have been correctly passed. 
More common uses include being able to determine [[drift]] due to the prevailing wind, providing position information to allow [[restricted airspace]] to be avoided, and identifying one<U+2019>s location for retrieval teams after landing-out in unfamiliar territory.
It can also be interesting to view a GPS track of a flight when back on the ground, to analyze flying technique. [[Computer software]] is available which allows various different analyses of GPS tracks.<ref>e.g: [http://www.compegps.com/new/products.php?var=1&tipoweb=1&todos=1&prod=16 CompeGPS.]</ref> More recently, the use of GPS data, linked to a [[computer]], has enabled pilots to share [[3D computer graphics|3D]] tracks of their flights on [[Google Earth]]. This fascinating insight allows comparisons between competing pilots to be made in a detailed 'post-flight' analysis.

== Pros & contras ==
Some compromises and advantages when comparing a FLPHG with unpowered hang gliding:

'''Pros'''
*Glider launch autonomy. No crew required.
*Multiple takeoff areas available. No long drives.
*No need to invest a whole day in order to fly.
*Easy to face the wind for takeoff, regardless of wind direction. 
*[[Slope soaring|Ridge soaring]] new places without land access to the top.
*In-flight restarts allow the pilot to soar cross-country downwind and then fly under power back to his departure point.

*The added harness [[weight]] can increase [[injury]] in case of a severe nose in.
*There is a slightly longer set-up time with a more complex preflight.

== In Development ==
Powered hang gliders' technology is quite young and continuously evolving and improving.

'''[[Ornithopter|Flapping wings]]'''

Stephan Nitsch and [[Yves Rousseau]] believe that the modern hang glider is suitable for flapping flight as the flex-wing behaves like a bird wing or a bat wing and the airframe can be adapted to flapping flight driven by a compressed air engine.<ref>Ornithopter hang glider: 
[http://www.jumpnfly.privat.t-online.de/ni.htm?nilinks.htm]</ref><ref>Yves Rousseau: [http://www.jumpnfly.privat.t-online.de/rouss00.jpg]</ref>

'''[[Ducted fan]]''' 

Advantages:
* A ducted fan offers greater propulsive efficiency and a smaller frontal area.
* By reducing propeller blade tip losses and directing its thrust towards the back only, the ducted fan is more efficient in producing thrust than a conventional propeller advancing at low speed (80 knots).
* Ducted fans are quieter than propellers: they shield the blade noise, and reduce the tip speed and intensity of the [[wingtip vortices|tip vortices]] both of which contribute to noise production.

Challenges:
* Complex duct design.
* Requires of high RPM and minimal vibration - Electric or [[Wankel engine]] needed.
* A significant weight increase even if constructed from advanced composites. 
* Tradeoff between additional power and drag increase during glide (power off) and also, at an angle of incidence of 32<sup>o</sup>, parts of the duct would be stalled and producing drag.<ref>Jon Longbottom - Mechanical aeronautics, thesis in PDF format: [http://www.thepico.com.au/pico/images/b/bb/Drag_reduction_of_Paramotor.pdf] 
</ref>

'''[[Electric motors]]''' - 
* Designers '''Csaba Lemak''' and '''Patrick MacKenzie''' constructed a [[powered paraglider]] powered by 112 Lithium Polymer ([[LiPo]]) batteries and a {{Auto hp|17|0}} custom wound three phase motor weighing 1.5 kg coupled to a 3.6 to 1 reduction dive.<ref>Electric Paramotor home page. [http://www.electricppg.com/]</ref> Their electric powered paraglider flew for the first time on the 6 June, 2006 in [[Ontario, Canada]]. With flight autonomy of only 35 min, it has many advantages, such as ease of operation, minimum maintenance and power output is not altitude dependent. 

* '''Richard Kruger-Sprengel''' (Helix Propeller) and German designer '''Werner Eck''', have produced at least two electric powered paraglider (EPPG) prototypes <ref>Werner Eck, designer of an Electric PGG [http://www.marksparaglidingpages.com/]</ref>, their first machine flew in 2001 for 3.5 min and was the first EPPG; Their latest prototype was tested on February 2007 and it uses a motor described as: LEM 200 / Fa. Lemco, brushes <U+2013> disc / 5.5 kg, direct current, 10 kW at 2.200 rpm, 50 Volt at 200 Ampere. Controller: Fa. Brusa, 48 V / 500 A / 1,7 kg. Battery: 14 accumulator Saft 35 Ah connected in series 14 x 3,6 V = 50,4 V. Lithium-Ion-Technology. Weight: 15 kg. Time to charge: 20 min to 2 hours.

* '''ElectroPropulsion Ltd.''' and '''Electric Flight Systems Ltd.''' have teamed up with the British Defence Academy scientists to assist in research and development of electric powered flight optimised for the leisure aviation market

Advantages:
*Superb reliability. 
*Extremely easy re-start.
*Simple operation and maintenance.
*Small size components.
*No flammable fuel or oil required.
*No exhaust gases.
*Minimal cooling required, allowing for better aerodynamic profile.
*Noise produced only by the propeller.

Challenges: 
* Battery weight.
* Flight autonomy time.
