The '''Rockhampton Grammar School''' is an [[Independent school|independent]], [[co-education]]al, [[non-denominational]], [[Day school|day]] and [[boarding school]] located in [[Rockhampton, Queensland|Rockhampton]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]].

It has recently expanded to include the newly compulsory Preparatory year level, starting one year before Year 1.
The Rockhampton Grammar school was founded in 1881, and was originally a co-educational school before becoming an all-boys' school until 1977 when it again became co-educational. In 2006 the School celebrates 125 years in education.

The four school houses are Kellow, Wheatley, Wheatcroft and Jardine, all being named after previous headmasters. The current Headmaster is Mr Islay Lee.

The School offers both boarding and day facilities, and also boasts a large population of international students.

In 2005, the School became the first school to win all three interschool sporting tournaments in the same year, coming first in the interschool swimming carnival, the sports carnival and the interschool cross country race.

Every year, the School hosts a number of fund-raising events, such as school dances, Valentine's Day celebrations, Grammar Muster, dress-down days and an annual Race Day.
