'''George Hay, 7th Earl of Erroll''' {{small|[[Privy Council of Scotland|PC]]}} ({{circa|1508}} <U+2013> 30 January 1573) was a Scottish nobleman and politician. 

==Biography==

Hay was the grandson of [[William Hay, 3rd Earl of Erroll]]; George's father Thomas was killed alongside his older brother, [[William Hay, 4th Earl of Erroll]], at the [[Battle of Flodden]] in 1513.<ref name="earldoms">{{cite book|last1=Mackintosh|first1=John|authorlink=John Mackintosh (historian)|title=Historic Earls and Earldoms of Scotland|date=1898|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3_8OAAAAQAAJ}}</ref>
<ref name="peerage">{{cite book|author=[[James Balfour Paul]]|title=[[The Scots Peerage]]: Volume 3|date=1906|publisher=D. Douglas|pages=568-569|ref=Balfour Paul}}</ref>

After his cousin [[William Hay, 6th Earl of Erroll]] died in 1541 leaving only a young daughter, George succeeded to the earldom and with it the family title of  [[Lord High Constable of Scotland]]. The sixth earl, who inherited the earldom as a toddler, died under the age of 21; by the time George inherited the titles, the barony had been in the possession of the crown for 19 years, four months.

In September and December 1741, the crown transferred into the new earl's hands the lands and baronies of [[Errol, Perth and Kinross|Errol]], Capeth, Inchiref, and Fossoquhy in [[Perthshire]]; Cowie in [[Kincardine]], Cassingray in [[Fife]]; Dronlaw and Innerpeffer in [[Forfarshire]]; and Slains in [[Aberdeenshire]].<ref name="peerage"/>

The [[Peerage of Scotland]] is unique in that it allows the titles to descend along the female lines; Jean, the young daughter of the sixth earl of Erroll, could have conceivable inherited the earldom as Countess of Erroll. Instead, the crown negotiated for George to inherit, with the condition that he pay 4,000 [[Merk (coin)|merks]] to Helen, Dowager Countess of Erroll and to marry one of his sons to Jean Hay "at the King<U+2019>s pleasure."<ref name="peerage"/>

==Political service==

Following the death of [[James V of Scotland]]<U+2014>leaving only six-day old [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Princess Mary]] as his successor<U+2014>Erroll was one of the Scottish nobles who signed an agreement to support taking the [[regency]] from the [[James Hamilton, Duke of Ch<U+00E2>tellerault|Earl of Arran]] in favour of the [[Mary of Guise|Queen Mother]]  by suggesting that his father's divorce and second marriage were invalid, making Arran illegitimate. In April 1567, Erroll was a signatory to [[Ainslie Tavern Bond|Ainslie's Tavern Band]] agreeing to the marriage of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] to the [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]].<ref>Wormald, Jenny, ''Lords and Men in Scotland'', John Donald (1985), 406.</ref>

He was a member of the [[Privy Council of Scotland|Privy Council]] of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] in 1561.  He side with the Hamiltons in the interest of the captive Queen Mary in 1569, but did not forfeit his titles in his support of the queen.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Hays of Erroll|volume=38|journal=[[The Spectator]]|date=27 May 1865|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ans_AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA579|page=579}}</ref>

==Marriage and issue==
In 1528, Hay married Margaret Robertson, daughter of Alexander Robertson of Struan, 24th chief of [[Clan Donnachaidh]], and granddaughter of [[John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Atholl]] and by her had nine children:{{sfn|Balfour Paul|pp=569-571}}
*Lady Elizabeth Hay (b. 1531), married Sir William Keith, Lord of Keith, son of [[William Keith, 4th Earl Marischal]]
*[[Andrew Hay, 8th Earl of Erroll]], married his cousin Jean Hay, daughter of the sixth Earl of Erroll
*Lady Margaret Hay, married [[Laurence Oliphant, 4th Lord Oliphant]]

*George Hay of Ardlethen
*Lady Beatrix Hay (b. {{circa|1560}}), married William Hay of [[Delgatie Castle|Delgatie]]
*Thomas Hay, [[parson]] of [[Turriff]]
*Alexander Hay

In 1561, the earl married Helen Bryson, daughter of Walter Bryson of Pitcullen, and had two more children:
*Eupham Hay (likely died young)
