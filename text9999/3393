Ethanol production in Brazil uses [[sugarcane]] as [[feedstock]] and relies on first-generation technologies based on the use of the [[sucrose]] content of sugarcane. Ethanol yield has grown 3.77% per year since 1975 and productivity gains been based on improvements in the agricultural and industrial phases of the production process. Further improvements on best practices are expected to allow in the short to mid-term an average ethanol productivity of 9,000 [[liter]]s per [[hectare]].<ref name="Goldemberg"/>

===Production process===

[[Sucrose]] extracted from [[sugarcane]] accounts for little more than 30% of the chemical energy stored in the mature plant; 35% is in the leaves and stem tips, which are left in the fields during harvest, and 35% are in the fibrous material ([[bagasse]]) left over from pressing. Most of the [[industrial process]]ing of sugarcane in [[Brazil]] is done through a very integrated production chain, allowing sugar production, industrial ethanol processing, and electricity generation from byproducts.<ref name="Goldemberg"/><ref name="SusDutch">{{cite web|url=http://www.bioenergytrade.org/downloads/sustainabilityofbrazilianbioethanol.pdf|title=Sustainability of Brazilian bio-ethanol|author=Edward Smeets, Martin Junginger et al|publisher=Copernicus Institute at [[Universiteit Utrecht]] and [[Universidade Estadual de Campinas]]|year=2006|month=August|accessdate=2008-11-23}} Report NWS-E-2006-110, ISBN 90-8672-012-9 </ref> The typical steps for large scale production of sugar and ethanol include [[milling]], [[electricity generation]], [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]], [[distillation]] of ethanol, and [[dehydration]].
====Milling and refining====
{{see also|Sugarcane}}
Once harvested, sugarcane is usually transported to the plant by [[semi-trailer truck]]s. After [[quality control]] sugarcane is washed, chopped, and shredded by revolving knives. The feedstock is fed to and extracted by a set of mill combinations
to collect a juice, called [[garapa]] in Brazil, that contain 10&ndash;15 percent sucrose, and [[bagasse]], the fiber residue. The main objective of the milling process is to extract the largest possible amount of sucrose from the cane, and a secondary but important objective is the production of bagasse with a low moisture content as boiler fuel, as bagasse is burned for electricity generation (see below), allowing the plant to be self-sufficient in energy and to generate electricity for the local power grid.<ref name="SusDutch"/> 
The cane juice or garapa is then filtered and treated by chemicals and [[pasteurize]]d. Before [[evaporation]], the juice is filtered once again, producing [[vinasse]], a fluid rich in organic compounds. The syrup resulting from evaporation is then [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitated]] by [[crystallization]] producing a mixture of clear crystals surrounded by [[molasses]]. A [[centrifuge]] is used to separate the sugar from molasses, and the crystals are washed by addition of steam, after which the crystals are dried by an airflow. Upon cooling, sugar crystallizes out of the syrup.<ref name="SusDutch"/>  From this point, the sugar [[refining]] process continues to produced different types of sugar, and the molasses continue a separate process to produce ethanol.

====Fermentation, destillation and dehydration====
{{See also|Ethanol fermentation|Azeotropic distillation}}

The resulting molasses are treated to become a sterilized molasse free of impurities, ready to be fermented. In the [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] process sugars are transformed into ethanol by addition of [[yeast]]. Fermentation time varies from four to twelve hours resulting in an alcohol content of 7 to 10 percent by total volume ([[degrees Gay-Lussac|<U+00B0>GL]]), called fermented wine. The yeast is recovered from this wine through a centrifuge. Making use of the different boiling points the alcohol in the fermented wine is separated from the main resting solid components. The remaining product is [[hydrated]] ethanol with a concentration of 96<U+00B0>GL,<ref name="SusDutch"/>  the highest concentration of ethanol that can be achieved via [[azeotropic]][[distillation]], and by national specification can contain up to 4.9% of water by volume.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nxt.anp.gov.br/NXT/gateway.dll/leg/resolucoes_anp/2005/dezembro/ranp%2036%20-%202005.xml?f=templates$fn=default.htm&sync=1&vid=anp:10.1048/enu|title=Resolu<U+00E7><U+00E3>o ANP N<U+00BA> 36, DE 6.12.2005 - DOU 7.12.2005 |publisher=ANP|author=Ag<U+00EA>ncia Nacional do Petr<U+00F3>leo, G<U+00E1>s Natural e Biocombust<U+00ED>veis (ANP)|date=2005-12-06|accessdate=2008-11-15|language=Portuguese}} See Table I <U+2013> Specifications for AEAC and AEHC at "Anexo: Regulamente T<U+00E9>cnico ANP N<U+00BA> 7/2005.</ref> This hydrous ethanol is the fuel used by ethanol-only and [[flexible-fuel vehicle|flex]] vehicles in the country.

====Electricity generation from bagasse====
{{See also|Bioenergy}}
Since the early days [[bagasse]] was burnt in the plant to provide the energy required for the industrial part of the process. Today, the Brazilian best practice uses high-pressure [[boiler]]s that increases energy recovery, allowing most sugar-ethanol plants to be energetically self-sufficient and even sell surplus electricity to utilities.<ref name="Goldemberg"/> By 2000, the total amount of sugarcane bagasse produced per year was 50 million tons/dry basis out of more than 300 million tons of harvested sugarcane. Several authors estimated a potential power generation from the use of sugarcane bagasse ranging from 1,000 to
9,000 [[Megawatt|MW]], depending on the technology used and the use of harvest trash. One utility in S<U+00E3>o Paulo is buying more than 1% of its electricity from sugar mills, with a production capacity of 600 MW for self-use and 100 MW for sale.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/776604-lpihxY/webviewable/776604.PDF|format=PDF|title=Preliminary Assessment of Potential CDM Early Start Projects in Brazil|author=S.

The analysis also found tha sugarcane bagasse cogeneration accounts for 3% of the total Brazilian energy matrix.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://energy.ihs.com/News/biofuels/2008/frost-brazil-bagasse-093008.htm|title=Frost: Brazil Turns to Sugarcane Bagasse Power Generation to Reduce Hydropower Dependence |author=[[Frost & Sullivan]]|publisher=[[IHS Inc.|Information Handling Services (IHS)]]|date=2008-09-30|accessdate=2008-11-23}}</ref>  The energy is especially valuable to utilities because it is produced mainly in the dry season when hydroelectric dams are running low. 

According to a study commissioned by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government in 2006 to evaluate the sustainability of Brazilian bioethanol "''...there are also substantial gains possible in the efficiency of electricity use and generation: The electricity used for distillery operations has been estimated at 12.9 kWh/tonne cane, with a best available technology rate of 9.6 kWh/tonne cane . For electricity generation the efficiency could be increased from 18 kWh/tonne cane presently, to 29.1 kWh/tonne cane maximum. The production of surplus electricity could in theory be increased from 5.3 kWh/tonne cane to 19 kWh/tonne cane''".<ref name="SusDutch"/>

There are several improvements to the industrial processes, such as adopting a [[hydrolysis]] process to produce ethanol instead of surplus electricity, or the use of advanced boiler and turbine technology to increase the electricity yield, or a higher use of excess bagasse and harvest trash currently left behind in the fields, that together with various other efficiency improvements in sugarcane farming and the distribution chain have the potential to allow further efficiency increases, translating into higher yields, lower production costs, and also further improvements in the [[energy balance]] and the reduction of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.<ref name="SusDutch"/>

Brazil is the world's largest exporter of ethanol. In 2007 it exported 933.4 million gallons (3,532.7 million [[liter]]s),<ref name="MAPA07"/><ref name="EUx"/> representing almost 20% of its production, and accounting for almost 50% of the global exports.  <ref name="SWE">{{cite web |url=http://www.gronabilister.se/file.php?REF=39461a19e9eddfb385ea76b26521ea48&art=376&FILE_ID=20060511084611.pdf |title=Ethanol production from Sugar Cane in Brazil |publisher=Gr<U+00F6>na Bilister|year=2006|language= |accessdate-=2008-05-10|format=PDF}}</ref> Since 2004 Brazilian exporters have as their main customers the [[United States]], [[Netherlands]], [[Japan]], [[Sweden]], [[Jamaica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Trinidad & Tobago]], [[Nigeria]], [[Mexico]], [[India]], and [[South Korea]].<ref name="SWE"/> 

The countries in the [[Caribbean Basin]] import relative high quantities of Brazilian ethanol, but not much is destined for domestic consumption. These countries reprocess the product, usually converting Brazilian hydrated ethanol into anhydrous ethanol, and then re-export it to the United States, gaining value-added and avoiding the 2.5 percent duty and the [[USD]] 0,54 per gallon [[tariff]], thanks to the trade agreements and benefits granted by [[Caribbean Basin Initiative|Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI)]]. This process is limited by a quota, set at 7% of U.S. ethanol consumption.<ref name="CBI">{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKB53020120080305?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0|title=Brazil's ethanol exports to rise in 2008:F.O.Licht|publisher=Reuters UK|date=2008-03-05|accessdate=2008-05-10|language= }}</ref> Although direct U.S. exports fell in 2007, imports from four CBI countries almost doubled, increasing from 15.5% in 2006 to 25.8% in 2007, reflecting increasing re-exports to the U.S., thus partially compensating the loss of Brazilian direct exports to the U.S. This situation has caused some concerns in the United States, as it and Brazil are trying to build a partnership to increase ethanol production in Latin American and the Caribbean. As the U.S. is encouraging "new ethanol production in other countries, production that could directly compete with U.S.-produced ethanol".<ref>{{ cite web |url=http://www.senate.gov/~finance/press/Gpress/2007/prg030207.pdf |title=Grassley Expresses Concern Over Possible U.S.-Brazil Partnership on Ethanol|publisher=United States Senate|date=2007-03-02|author=Charles E. Grassley|accessdate=2008-05-11|format=PDF}}</ref>

The U.S., potentially the largest market for the Brazilian ethanol, currently imposes trade restrictions on Brazilian ethanol of $[[USD]] 0.54 per gallon, in order to encourage domestic ethanol production, most of which has so far been based on processing corn instead of sugar cane or soybeans, which is much less efficient. There is concern that allowing the Brazilian ethanol to enter the U.S. market without taxation will undercut the budding ethanol industry in the United States.<ref>Letter from six Democratic Senators to President Bush at [http://harkin.senate.gov/news.cfm?id=255348]</ref> One of the arguments for that is that Brazil currently subsidises its ethanol production, which is false, as the subsidies program finished in the 1990s.<ref>Report on CommonDreams.org at [http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0417-23.htm]</ref> Others argue that rather than impose trade restrictions on the import of the Brazilian product, that the U.S. should make subsidies of its own available to support its fledgling domestic producers. Exports of Brazilian ethanol to the U.S. reached a total of US$ 1 billion in 2006, an increase of 1,020% over 2005 (US$ 98 millions),<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/dinheiro/ult91u300940.shtml|publisher=Folha de S<U+00E3>o Paulo|title=Exporta<U+00E7><U+00F5>es de <U+00E1>lcool para os EUA crescem mais de 900% em 2006 |language=Portuguese|date=2007-05-30|accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> but fell significantly in 2007 due to sharp increases in American ethanol production from [[maize]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/GlobalAgricultureandBiofuels08/idUSN1440343720080114 |title=Brazil local demand to drive ethanol production|author=Inae Riveras|date=2008-01-04|accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/blog2/2007/12/04/brazilian-ethanol-exports-plummet-31-percent-as-us-ethanol-glut-dampens-trade/|date=2007-12-04|title= Brazilian ethanol exports plummet 31 percent as US ethanol glut dampens trade |publisher=Biofuels Digest|accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref>

As shown in the table, together, the United States, the [[European Union]], the [[Caribbean Basin Initiative|CBI countries]] with Mexico, and Japan, were the destination of 91% of Brazilian ethanol exports, both in 2007 and 2006. As of 2007, the European Union region, led by the Netherlands, is the main importer of Brazilian ethanol, with 265.3 million gallons (1,004.2 million liters)<ref name="MAPA07"/>. However, and despite of reduced direct imports, the United States continues to be the single one country where Brazilian ethanol is exported, reaching 228.96 million gallons (866.6 million liters) to the [[Continental United States|continental U.S.]], 13.78 million gallons (52.1 million liters) shipped to the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]], and 3.68 million gallons (14.0 million litters) shipped to [[Puerto Rico]], for a total export for the U.S. in 2007 of 246.4 million gallons (932.75 million liters),<ref name="MAPA07"/> down from 469.6 million gallons (1.77 billion liters) in 2006.<ref name="MAPA06"/>

==Prices and effect on oil consumption==

Most automobiles in Brazil run either on [[hydrous]] alcohol ([[Common ethanol fuel mixtures|E100]]) or on gasohol ([[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E20, E25|E25 blend]]), as the mixture of 25% [[anhydrous]] ethanol with gasoline is mandatory in the entire country.<ref name="Portaria2007"/> Since 2003, dual-fuel ethanol [[flexible-fuel vehicle|flex vehicles]] that run on any proportion of hydrous ethanol and gasoline have been gaining popularity, surpassing 6 million new cars and light commercial vehicles sold by August 2008,<ref name= "Folha Online"/> and as the same month, 75% of light vehicle manufacturing production is flexible fuel without additional cost for buyers.<ref name="ANFAVEA3">{{cite web | url=http://www.anfavea.com.br/tabelas/autoveiculos/tabela10_producao.pdf| title= Produ<U+00E7><U+00E3>o de Autom<U+00F3>veis por Tipo e Combust<U+00ED>vel - 2008 (Tabela 10) |publisher=ANFAVEA - Associa<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Nacional dos Fabricantes de Ve<U+00ED>culos Automotores (Brasil)|accessdate=2008-09-28 |language=Portuguese }}</ref> Customers have 49 models available to chose from. Brazilian full flex-fuel vehicles have electronic sensors that automatically detect the type of fuel and the blend mix, and accordingly adjust the engine combustion.

Due to the lower energy content of ethanol fuel, full flex-fuel vehicles get fewer miles per gallon. Ethanol price has to be between 25-30% cheaper per gallon to reach the break even point.<ref name="Apollo"/> As a [[rule of thumb]], Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the harvest yields and seasonal fluctuation of sugarcane harvest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opiniaoweb.com/portal/alcool-ou-gasolina-saiba-qual-escolher-quando-for-abastecer/ |title=<U+00C1>lcool ou Gasolina?

The price ratio between gasoline and ethanol fuel has been well above 30% during this period for most states, except during low sugar cane supply between harvests and for states located far away from the ethanol production centers. According to Brazilian producers, ethanol can remain competitive if the price of oil does not fall below USD 30 a barrel.<ref name="NYT100406"/>

By 2008 consumption of ethanol fuel by the Brazilian fleet of light vehicles, as pure ethanol and in gasohol, is replacing gasoline at the rate of about 27,000 cubic metres per day, and by February 2008 the combined consumption of anhydrous and hydrated ethanol fuel surpassed 50% of the fuel that would be needed to run the light vehicle fleet on pure gasoline alone.  Consumption of anhydrous ethanol for the mandatory E25 blend, together with hydrous ethanol used by flex vehicles, reached 1.432 billion liters, while pure gasoline consumption was 1.411 billion liters.<ref name= "ANP07_2008"/><ref name="50consumo"/>

However, the effect on the country's overall petroleum consumption was smaller than that, as domestic oil consumption still far outweighs ethanol consumption. In 2005, Brazil consumed {{convert|2|Moilbbl|m3}} of oil per day, versus {{convert|280000|oilbbl|m3}} of ethanol.<ref>US Dept. of Energy, "[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Brazil/Oil.html Country Analysis Briefs: Brazil]" (August 2006), Oil overview</ref> Although Brazil is a major oil producer and now exports gasoline (19,000 m<U+00B3>/day), it still must import oil because of internal demand for other oil byproducts, chiefly diesel fuel, which cannot be easily replaced by ethanol. When trucks and other diesel-powered vehicles are considered ethanol represented 16.9% of total energy consumption by the road transport sector in terms of [[Tonne of oil equivalent|energy equivalent to crude oil]], and 14.9% of the entire transport sector.<ref name="BEN2008"/>

==Comparison with the United States==
Brazil's sugar cane-based industry is more efficient than the U.S. corn-based industry. Sugar cane ethanol has an energy balance seven times greater than ethanol produced from corn.<ref name="Wilson"/> Brazilian distillers are able to produce ethanol for 22 cents per liter, compared with the 30 cents per liter for corn-based ethanol.<ref>''The Economist'', March 3-9th, 2007 "Fuel for Friendship" p. 44</ref> U.S. corn-derived ethanol costs 30% more because the corn starch must first be converted to sugar before being distilled into alcohol.<ref name="Ethanol"/>  Despite this cost differential in production, the U.S. does not import more Brazilian ethanol because of U.S. trade barriers corresponding to a [[tariff]] of 54-cent per gallon &ndash; a levy designed to offset the 51-cent per gallon blender's federal tax credit that is applied to ethanol no matter its country of origin.<ref>[http://www.renewableenergyaccess.com/rea/news/story?id=46863 U.S. Congress Stands Behind Domestic Ethanol, Extends Tariff<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Sugarcane cultivation requires a tropical or subtropical climate, with a minimum of 600 mm (24 in) of annual rainfall. Sugarcane is one of the most efficient photosynthesizers in the plant kingdom, able to convert up to 2% of incident solar energy into biomass. Sugarcane production in the United States occurs in [[Florida]], [[Louisiana]], [[Hawaii]], and [[Texas]].  The first three plants to produce sugarcane-based ethanol are expected to go online in Louisiana by mid 2009. Sugar mill plants in [[Lacassine, Lousiana|Lacassine]], [[St. James Parish, Louisiana|St. James]] and [[Bunkie, Louisiana|Bunkie]] were converted to sugar cane-based ethanol production using [[Colombia]]n technology in order to make possible a profitable ethanol production. These three plants will produce 100 million gallons of ethanol within five years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2008/06/columbian-group.html|publisher=Miami Herald|author=Gerardo Reyes|title=Colombians in U.S. sugar mills to produce ethanol|date=2008-06-08|accessdate=2008-06-11|language=}}</ref> By 2009 two other sugarcane ethanol production projects are being developed in [[Kauai]], Hawaii and [[Imperial Valley]], California.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ethanolproducer.com/article.jsp?article_id=5345&q=&page=all|journal=Ethanol Producer Magazine|author=Erin Voegele|title=Sugarcane Economics|year=2009|month=March|accessdate=2009-02-12|language=}}</ref>

In March 2007, "ethanol diplomacy" was the focus of President [[George W. Bush]]'s Latin American tour, in which he and Brazil's president, [[Luiz In<U+00E1>cio Lula da Silva]], were seeking to promote the production and use of sugar cane based ethanol throughout [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]]. The two countries also agreed to share technology and set international standards for biofuels.<ref name="WasPos1"/> The Brazilian sugar cane technology transfer will permit various [[Central American]], such as [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]], several [[Caribbean]] countries, and various [[Andean Community of Nations|Andean Countries]] tariff-free trade with the U.S. thanks to existing concessionary trade agreements. 

Even though the U.S. imposes a [[USD]] 0.54 tariff on every gallon of imported ethanol, the Caribbean nations and Central American countries are exempt from such duties based on the benefits granted by the [[Caribbean Basin Initiative|Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI)]].<ref name="CBI"/> CBI provisions allow tariff-free access to the US market from ethanol produced from foreign feedstock (outside CBI countries) up to 7% of the previous year US consumption. Also additional quotas are allowed if the beneficiary countries produce at least 30 percent of the ethanol from local feedstocks up to an additional 35 million gallons.<ref name="CAFTA">{{cite web|url=http://www.tradeobservatory.org/library.cfm?refid=73232 |title=CAFTA's Impact on U.S. Ethanol Market |publisher=The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy |author=Ben Lilliston |year=June |month=2005 |accessdate=2008-11-26 |language= }}</ref> Thus, several countries have been importing [[hydrated]] ethanol from Brazil, processing it at local distilleries to [[Dehydration|dehydrate]] it, and then re-exporting it as [[anhydrous ethanol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frost.com/prod/servlet/market-insight-top.pag?docid=130638594 |title=Latin American Ethanol Exports Exploit U.S. Legislative Loopholes |publisher=[[Frost & Sullivan]] |author=Tomas Piccinini |date=2008-05-21 |accessdate=2008-11-26 |language= }}</ref> American farmers have complained about this loophole to legally bypass the tariff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hughbartling.blogspot.com/2007/03/ethanol-tariff-loophole-sparks-boom-in.html |title=Ethanol Tariff Loophole Sparks a Boom in Caribbean |publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]] |author=Lauren Etter and Joel Millman |date=2007-03-09 |accessdate=2008-11-26|language= }} Originally published by the WSJ page A1</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpj.com/archives/2004/jul04/jul26/Senatorsurgeactiontocloseet.CFM |title=Senators urge action to close ethanol import loophole |publisher=High Plains Journal |author= |date=2004-07-20 |accessdate=2008-11-26 |language= }}</ref> The 2005 [[Central American Free Trade Agreement|Dominican Republic <U+2013> Central America Free Trade Agreement(CAFTA)]] maintained the benefits granted by the CBI, and CAFTA provisions established country-specific shares for Costa Rica and El Salvador within the overall quota.

The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that the American and Brazilian presidents signed in March 2007 has been described as a success for foreign policy, bringing Brazil and the United States closer especially on energy policy.

==Environmental and social impacts==
===Environmental effects===
====Benefits====
Ethanol produced from sugarcane provides energy that is renewable and less carbon intensive than oil. Bioethanol reduces air pollution thanks to its cleaner emissions, and also contributes to mitigate [[climate change]] by reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. However, several environmental and social issues and concerns have been raised regarding the Brazilian ethanol program.<ref name= "Times08"/> Among the most controversial are the risks associated with the expansion of agricultural land and its direct or indirect impact on natural habitats, and the [[carbon footprint]] associated to future land use changes as ethanol production expands beyond the existing arable lands.<ref name= "Times08"/><ref name= "Nature06">{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7120/full/444670a.html|title=Drink the best and drive the rest|author=Emma Marris|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=444 |issue= |pages=670 - 672 | doi=10.1038/444670a|date=2006-12-07|accessdate=2008-11-30|language=}} ''The complete pdf version is available'' [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/news/docs/drink%20the%20best%20drive%20the%20rest.pdf here]</ref><ref name="WBImpacts">{{cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2007/09/04/000158349_20070904162607/Rendered/PDF/wps4341.pdf|format=PDF|title=Review of environmental, economic and policy aspects of biofuels|publisher=[[The World Bank]]|author=Deepak Rajagopal and David Zilberman|year=2007|month=September|accessdate=2008-11-30}} Policy Research Working Paper 4341.

=====Energy Balance=====
{{see also|Ethanol fuel energy balance}}

One of the main concerns about bioethanol production is the [[energy balance]], the total amount of energy input into the process compared to the energy  released by burning the resulting ethanol fuel. This balance considers the full cycle of producing the fuel, as cultivation, transportation and production require energy, including the use of oil and fertilizers. A comprehensive [[life cycle assessment]] commissioned by the [[State of S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] found that Brazilian sugarcane based ethanol has a favorable energy balance, varying from 8.3 for average conditions to 10.2 for best practice production.<ref name= "MLA_2004"/> This means that for average conditions one unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create 8.3 energy units from the resulting ethanol. These findings have been confirmed by other studies.<ref name="SusDutch"/><ref name="Ethanol"/><ref name="WBImpacts"/>

=====Greenhouse gas emissions=====
Another benefit of bioethanol is the reduction of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions as compared to gasoline, because as much carbon dioxide is taken up by the growing plants as is produced when the bioethanol is burnt, with a zero theoretical net contribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.best-europe.org/Pages/ContentPage.aspx?id=482|title=Reduction of Greenhouse gases|publisher=[[BioEthanol for Sustainable Transport]]|accessdate=2008-11-30}}</ref> Several studies have shown that sugarcane based ethanol reduces greenhouse gases by 86 to 90% if there is no significant land use change,<ref name= "MLA_2004"/><ref name="Ethanol"/><ref name=UKRTFO/> and ethanol from sugarcane is regarded the most efficient biofuel currently under commercial production in terms of GHG emission reduction.<ref name="SusDutch"/><ref name="WBImpacts"/>  However, a study published in 2008<ref name="Fargione08"/> is critical of previous assessments of greenhouse gas emissions, as the authors considered that these studies did not take into account the effect of land use changes.<ref name="Times08"/> (see below "Effects of land use change")

=====Air pollution=====
The widespread use of ethanol brought several environmental benefits to urban centers regarding [[air pollution]]. [[Lead]] additives to gasoline were reduced through the 1980s as the amount of ethanol blended in the fuel was increased, and these additives were completely eliminated by 1991. The addition of ethanol blends instead of lead to gasoline lowered the total [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[sulfur]] emissions, and [[particulate matter]] significantly.<ref name="MacedoCH3">Macedo et al. (2007) op. cit. Chapter 3, pp. 79-90</ref> The use of ethanol-only vehicles has also reduced CO emissions drastically. Before the ''Pr<U+00F3>-<U+00C1>lcool'' Program started, when gasoline was the only fuel in use, CO emissions were higher than 50 g/km driven; they had been reduced to less than 5.8 g/km in 1995.<ref name="Goldemberg"/> Several studies have also shown that [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo (city)|S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] has benefit with significantly less air pollution thanks to ethanol's cleaner emissions.<ref name="MacedoCH3"/> Furthermore, Brazilian [[flexible-fuel vehicle|flex-fuel]] engines are being designed with higher [[compression ratio]]s, taking advantage of the higher ethanol blends and maximizing the benefits of the higher oxygen content of ethanol, resulting in lower emissions and improving fuel efficiency.<ref name="TRS08">{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/displaypagedoc.asp?id=28632|title=Sustainable biofuels: prospects and challenges|publisher=The Royal Society|year=2008|month=January}} Policy Document 01/08, pp. 35-36</ref></small>

Even though all automotive [[fossil fuel]]s emit aldehydes, one of the drawbacks of the use of [[hydrated]] ethanol in ethanol-only engines is the increase in [[aldehyde]] emissions as compared with gasoline or [[gasohol]].<ref name="MacedoCH3"/> However, the present ambient concentrations of aldehyde, in S<U+00E3>o Paulo city are below the reference levels recommended as adequate to human health found in the literature.<ref name="Goldemberg"/> Other concern is that because [[formaldehyde]] and [[acetaldehyde]] emissions are significantly higher, and although both aldehydes occur naturally and are frequently found in the open environment, additional emissions may be important because of their role in smog formation. However, more research is required to establish the extent and direct consequences, if any, on health.<ref name="TRS08">{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/displaypagedoc.asp?id=28632|title=Sustainable biofuels: prospects and challenges|publisher=The Royal Society|year=2008|month=January}} Policy Document 01/08, pp. 35-36</ref>

=====Water use and fertilizers=====
Ethanol production has also raised concerns regarding water overuse and pollution, soil erosion and possible contamination by excessive use of [[fertilizers]].<ref name= "Nature06"/><ref name="WBImpacts"/><ref name="EcoSocial">{{cite journal|url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/u45t0416h0224887/fulltext.pdf|format=PDF|title=Climate change, biofuels and eco-social impacts in the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado|date=2008-03-27|author=Donald Sawyer|journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]|accessdate=2008-12-05|doi=10.1098/rstb.2007.0030|year=2008|volume=363|pages=1747-1752}} ''Published online 2008-02-11''</ref> A study commissioned by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government in 2006 to evaluate the  sustainability of Brazilian bioethanol concluded that there is sufficient water to supply all foreseeable long-term water requirements for sugarcane and ethanol production. Also, and as a result of legislation and technological progress, the amount of water collected for ethanol production has decreased considerably during the previous years. The overuse of water resources seems a limited problem in general in S<U+00E3>o Paulo, particularly because of the relatively high rainfall, yet, some local problems may occur. Regarding water pollution due to sugarcane production, [[Embrapa]] classifies the industry as level 1, which means <U+201C>no impact<U+201D> on water quality.<ref name="EnergiaCana"/><ref name="SusDutch"/> 

This evaluation also found that consumption of agrochemicals for sugar cane production is lower than in citric, corn, coffee and soybean cropping. Disease and pest control, including the use of agrochemicals, is a crucial element in all cane production. The study found that development of resistant sugar cane varieties is a crucial aspect of disease and pest control and is one of the primary objectives of Brazil<U+2019>s cane genetic improvement programs. Disease control is one of the main reasons for the replacement of a commercial variety of sugar cane.<ref name="SusDutch"/> 

=====Field burning=====
Advancements in fertilizers and natural pesticides have all but eliminated the need to burn fields.<ref name= "Nature06"/> Sugarcane fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers, by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to fertilize the fields with ash.<ref name="YahooUK"/> There has been less burning due to pressure from the public and health authorities, and as a result of the recent development of effective harvesting machines. A 2001 state law banned burning in sugarcane fields in [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo (state)|S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] state by 2021,<ref name="UNICA2014">{{cite web|url=http://www.unica.com.br/noticias/show.asp?nwsCode=D36F9C64-13B0-4916-9A30-BAFEDECBDD9B |title=C<U+00E2>mara de Ribeir<U+00E3>o rejeita lei inconstitucional pelo final da queima nos canaviais  |author= |publisher= UNICA|date=2008-09-12 |accessdate=2008-09-14 |language=Portuguese }}</ref> and machines will gradually replace human labor as the means of harvesting cane, except where the abrupt terrain does not allow for mechanical harvesting.

Due to mechanization the number of temporary workers in the sugarcane plantations has already declined.<ref name="SusDutch"/>

=====Effects of land use change=====
A study published in 2008 questioned the benefits estimated in previous assessments regarding the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from sugarcane based ethanol, as the authors consider that these studies did not take into account the effect of land use changes.<ref name="Fargione08"/><ref name="Times08">{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1725975,00.html|title=The Clean Energy Scam|date=2008-03-27|publisher=[[Time Magazine]]|author=Michael Grunwald|accessdate=2008-12-04}}</ref> The authors found a "biofuel carbon debt" is created when Brazil and other developing countries convert land in undisturbed ecosystems, such as [[rainforest]]s, [[savanna]]s, or [[grassland]]s, to [[biofuel]] production, and to crop production when agricultural land is diverted to biofuel production. This land use change releases more [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] than the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions that these biofuels would provide by displacing fossil fuels. Among others, the study analyzed the case of Brazilian [[Cerrado]] being converted for sugarcane ethanol production. The biofuel carbon debt on converted Cerrado is estimated to be repaid in 17 years, the least amount of time of the scenarios that were analyzed, as for example, ethanol from US [[maize|corn]] was estimated to have a 93 year payback time. The study conclusion is that the net effect of biofuel production via clearing of carbon-rich habitats is to increase CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for decades or centuries relative to fossil fuel use.<ref name="Fargione08"/> 

Regarding this concern, previous studies conducted in Brazil have shown there are 355 million ha of arable land in Brazil, of which only 72 million ha are in use.<ref name="Veja_30_04"/> Sugarcane is only taking 2% of arable land available,<ref name="ExpansaoCana"/> of which ethanol production represented 55% in 2008.<ref name="Folha_04_08"/> Embrapa estimates that there is enough agricultural land available to increase at least 30 times the existing sugarcane plantation without endangering sensible ecosystems or taking land destined for food crops.<ref name="ExpansaoCana"/> Most future growth is expected to take place on abandoned [[pasture]] lands, as it has been the historical trend in S<U+00E3>o Paulo state.<ref name="NYT100406"/><ref name="Goldemberg"/><ref name="ExpansaoCana"/><ref name="EnergiaCana"/> Also, productivity is expected to improve even further based on current biotechnology research, genetic improvement, and better agronomic practices, thus contributing to reduce land demand for future sugarcane cultures.<ref name="ExpansaoCana"/><ref name="EnergiaCana"/> This trend is demonstrated by the increases in agricultural production that took place in S<U+00E3>o Paulo state between 1990 and 2004, where [[coffee]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]], sugarcane and other food crops were grown in an almost constant area.<ref>Macedo et al. (2007) op. cit. Chapter 6,  131-138, see Table 5.</ref> 

Also regarding the potential negative impacts of land use changes on carbon emissions, a study commissioned by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government concluded that "''it is very difficult to determine the indirect effects of further land use for sugar cane production (i.e. sugar cane replacing another crop like soy or citrus crops, which in turn causes additional soy plantations replacing pastures, which in turn may cause deforestation), and also not logical to attribute all these soil carbon losses to sugar cane''".<ref name="SusDutch"/> Other authors have also questioned these indirect effects, as cattle pastures are displaced to the cheaper land near the Amazon.<ref name="NYT100406"/><ref name="Times08"/> Studies rebutting this concern claim tha land devoted to free grazing cattle is shrinking, as density of cattle on pasture land increased from 1.28 heads of cattle/ha to 1.41 from 2001 to 2005,<ref name="Goldemberg"/> and further improvements are expected in cattle feeding practices.<ref>Macedo et al. (2007) op. cit. Chapter 6, pp. 121-126 and 131-139.</ref>

There are rebuttals to these findings for assuming a worst case scenario</ref><ref name="Times08"/><ref name="EcoSocial"/> Embrapa has rebutted this concern explaining that 99.7% of sugarcane plantations are located at least 2,000 km from the Amazonia, and expansion during the last 25 years took place in the Center-South region, also far away from the Amazonia, the Pantanal or the Atlantic forest. In [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo (state)|S<U+00E3>o Paulo state]] growth took place in abandoned pasture lands.<ref name="ExpansaoCana"/><ref name="EnergiaCana"/> 

The impact assessment regarding future changes in land use, forest protection and risks on biodiversity conducted as part of the study commissioned by the Dutch government<ref name="SusDutch"/> concluded that "''the direct impact of cane production on biodiversity is limited, because cane production replaces mainly pastures and/or food crop and sugar cane production takes place far from the major biomes in Brazil (Amazon Rain Forest, Cerrado, Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, Campos Sulinos and Pantanal)''". However, "''...the indirect impacts from an increase of the area under sugar cane production are likely more severe. The most important indirect impact would be an expansion of the area agricultural land at the expense of cerrados. The cerrados are an important biodiversity reserve. These indirect impacts are difficult to quantify and there is a lack of practically applicable criteria and indicators.''"<ref name="SusDutch"/>

Brazil's president, [[Luiz In<U+00E1>cio Lula da Silva]] has also claimed this concern is not valid. According to him ''"The Portuguese discovered a long time ago that the Amazon isn't a place to plant cane."''<ref>{{cite web|author=Alan Clendenning|date=2007-07-10 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20070710/ai_n19354074|title=Brazil: Ethanol farming won't impact Amazon rain forest|publisher=Oakland Tribune|language= }}</ref> In order to guarantee a sustainable development of ethanol production, the government is working on a countrywide zoning plan to restrict sugarcane growth in or near environmentally sensitive areas, allowing only the eight existing plants to remain operating in these sensitive areas, but without further extension of their sugarcane fields.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ces.fgvsp.br/index.cfm?fuseaction=noticia&IDnoticia=127799&IDidioma=1 |title=Governo quer conter cana na Amaz<U+00F4>nia |publisher=[[Folha de S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] |date=2008-09-14 |author=Marta Salomon |accessdate=2008-09-14 |language=Portuguese}} Direct access to the Folha on line is by subscription only (the url corresponds to press clipping site from a research institute, [[Funda<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Get<U+00FA>lio Vargas]])</ref> The proposed restricted area has 4.6 million square kilometers, almost half of the Brazilian territory.

===Social implications===
[[Image:Trabalho.JPG|thumb|right|Typical sugarcane worker during the harvest season, [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo (state)|S<U+00E3>o Paulo state]].]]
Sugarcane has had an important social contribution to the some of the poorest people in Brazil by providing income usually above the [[minimum wage]], and a formal job with fringe benefits.<ref name="SusDutch"/><ref name="MacedoCH12">Macedo et al. (2007) op. cit. Chapter 12, pp. 203-231.</ref> Formal employment in Brazil accounts an average 45% across all sectors, while the sugarcane sector has a share of 72.9% formal jobs in 2007, up from 53.6% in 1992, and in the more developed sugarcane ethanol industry in [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo (state)|S<U+00E3>o  Paulo state]] formal employment reached 93.8% in 2005.<ref name="MacedoCH12"/> Average wages in sugar cane and ethanol production are above the official minimum wage, but minimum wages may be insufficient to avoid poverty.<ref name="SusDutch"/> 
The North-Northeast regions stands out for having much lower levels of education among workers and lower monthly income. The average number workers with 3 or less school years in Brazil is 58.8%, while in the Southeast this percentage is 46.2%, in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast region]] is 76,4%.<ref name="MacedoCH12"/> Therefore, earnings in the Center-South are not surprisingly higher than those in the North-Northeast for comparable levels of education.<ref name="SusDutch"/> In 2005 sugarcane harvesting workers in the Center-South region received an average wage 58.7% higher than the average wage in the North-Northeast region.<ref name="MacedoCH12"/> The main social problems are related to cane cutters which do most of the low-paid work related to ethanol production.<ref name="SusDutch"/>

The total number of permanent employees in the sector fell by one-third between 1992 and 2003, in part due to the increasing reliance on mechanical harvesting, especially in the richest and more mature sugarcane producers of S<U+00E3>o Paulo state. During the same period, the share of temporary or seasonal workers has fluctuated, first declining and then increasing in recent years to about one-half of the total jobs in the sector, but in absolute terms the number of temporary workers has declined also.<ref name="SusDutch"/> The sugarcane sector in the poorer Northeast region is more labor intensive as production in this region represents only 18.6% of the country's total production but employs 44.3% of worker force in the sugarcane sector.<ref name="MacedoCH12"/>   

The manual harvesting of sugarcane has been associated with hardship and poor working conditions.<ref name="NYT100406"/><ref name="SusDutch"/><ref name="EcoSocial"/> In this regard, the study commissioned by the Dutch government<ref name="SusDutch"/> confirmed that the main problem is indeed related to manual cane harvesting. A key problem in working conditions is the high work load. As a result of mechanization the workload per worker has increased from 4 to 6 ton per day in the eighties to 8 to 10 ton per day in the nineties, up to 12 to 15 ton per day in 2007, and if the quota is not fulfill workers can be fired.<ref name="NYT100406"/><ref name="SusDutch"/> Producers say this problem will disappear with greater mechanization in the next decade.<ref name="NYT100406"/> Also, as mechanization of the harvesting is increasing and only feasible in flat terrain, more workers are being used in areas where conditions are not suitable for mechanized harvesting equipment, such as rough areas where the crops are planted irregularly, making working conditions harder and more hazardous.<ref name="SusDutch"/>

Also unhealthy working conditions and even cases of slavery and deaths from overwork (cane cutting) have been reported,<ref name="EcoSocial"/> but these are likely worst-case examples.<ref name="SusDutch"/>  Even though sufficiently strict labor laws are present in Brazil, enforcement is weak.<ref name="SusDutch"/> Displacement and seasonal labor also implies physical and cultural disruption of multifunctional family farms and traditional communities.<ref name="EcoSocial"/> 

Regarding [[social responsibility]] the ethanol production sector maintains more than 600 schools, 200 nursery centers and 300 day care units, as legislation requires that 1% of the net sugar cane price and 2% of the net ethanol price must be devoted to medical, dental, pharmaceutical, sanitary, and educational services for sugar cane workers. In practice more than 90% of the mills provide health and dental care, transportation and collective life insurance, and over 80% provide meals and pharmaceutical care. However, for the temporary low wage workers in cane cutting these services may not be available. <ref name="SusDutch"/>

===Effect on food prices===

[[Luiz In<U+00E1>cio Lula da Silva]] gave a strong rebuttal, calling these claims "''fallacies resulting from commercial interests''", and putting the blame instead on [[U.S.]] and [[European Union|European]] [[Agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]], and a problem restricted to U.S. ethanol produced from maize.

The report discusses some existing problems and potential risks, and asks the Brazilian government for caution to avoid jeopardizing its environmental and social sustainability.

The study said that "''...large increases in biofuels production in the United States and Europe are the main reason behind the steep rise in global food prices''" and also stated that "''Brazil's sugar-based ethanol did not push food prices appreciably higher''".<ref name="Veja_28_07">{{Cite news|url=http://vejaonline.abril.com.br/notitia/servlet/newstorm.ns.presentation.NavigationServlet?publicationCode=1&pageCode=1&textCode=145568&date=currentDate |title=Etanol n<U+00E3>o influenciou nos pre<U+00E7>os dos alimentos

The OECD study is also critical of the limited reduction of [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions achieved from biofuels produced in Europe and North America, concluding that the current biofuel support policies would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport fuel by no more than 0.8 percent by 2015, while Brazilian ethanol from sugar cane reduces greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80 percent compared to fossil fuels.
