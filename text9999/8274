'''Wingerworth''' is a village south of [[Chesterfield]] in [[Derbyshire]]. It is in the [[North East Derbyshire]] district. The settlements of [[Tupton]], [[Grassmoor]], [[Clay Cross]], [[Ashover]] and [[Holymoorside]] are nearby.

Wingerworth was once part of a large [[Estate (land)|estate]], known as the Hunloke estate. The Hunlokes lived in Wingerworth Hall and owned a large part of the village. The hall was demolished in the [[1920s]] and the land was sold. Servants' quarters from the hall still survive, but housing estates are now on the former estate land.

==Facilities==
There are two [[primary school]]s in Wingerworth <U+2014> Hunloke Park and Deer Park Primary School. Half of Hunloke Park Primary was recently destroyed by [[fire]]; at present, students are accommodated in [[portable classroom]]s in the playground. The nearest [[secondary school]] is [[Tupton Hall School]] in the nearby village of Tupton.

There are also several local shops, a library and a [[SPAR]] superstore.
