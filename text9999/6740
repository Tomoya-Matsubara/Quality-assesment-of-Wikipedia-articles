'''Circus Juventas''' (formerly '''Circus of the Star''') is a youth [[performing arts]] [[circus]] school located in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], and serving [[youth]] throughout the [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul]] metropolitan area. The organization was founded in 1994 by Dan and Betty Butler, and offers [[circus arts]] training to young people ranging in age from 3<U+2013>21.

Emulating the style of [[Cirque du Soleil]], Circus Juventas's first show was at Saint Paul's Highland Fest in 1995. From there, the school's enrollment quickly expanded and the organization initiated a campaign to fund a $2.1 million permanent [[big top (circus)|big top]] facility which opened in 2001 on Saint Paul parkland in the [[Highland Park, Saint Paul|Highland Park neighborhood]]. That year, it began to produce annual summer performances showcasing the work of its most advanced students, each with a distinct theme. 

These shows have proven popular with local audiences and have been well received critically, with reviewers praising the professionalism and fearlessness exhibited in the productions, while noting the occasional mishap of the school's performers. In addition, Circus Juventas students have performed and competed both around the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area and abroad. Today, Juventas is the largest youth performing arts circus in North America and it has tentative plans to add a second facility elsewhere in the region.

===Future===
In early 2014, the Butlers announced plans to expand their big top facility by an additional {{convert|10000|sqft|m2}}.<ref name="expanding spectacle" /> The additional space will house a dance and theater studio, a costume shop, offices, and a {{convert|4500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} gym.<ref name="expanding spectacle" /> Naming rights for the new structure will provide a component of the $4 million the school hopes to raise for the $2 million expansion, a $1 million addition to the circus's endowment, and eventual repairs to the building's exterior, estimated at $1 million.<ref name="expanding spectacle" /> Betty Butler stated that the project stemmed from the desire to create "a true professional program, a separate program" for students looking to study and perform circus arts post-Juventas, even though she and her husband originally shied away from pre-professional training as a core aspect of their circus school.<ref name="expanding spectacle" />

According to Saint Paul's Parks and Recreation Department, the cliffside space which the expansion would occupy is unsuitable for building a structure of the expansion's proposed size.<ref name=fighting>{{cite news|last1=Duchschere|first1=Kevin|title=Fighting with St. Paul, Circus Juventas hunts for new home|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/west/268673032.html?page=all|accessdate=July 26, 2014|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=July 26, 2014}}</ref> In response, the Butlers are considering building a new facility of up to {{convert|50000|sqft|m2}} in the western suburbs of Minneapolis<U+2013>Saint Paul.<ref name=fighting /> Construction of a new building would likely cost $10 million and would require a capital campaign to fund<ref name=fighting /> and would likely not begin for five to 10 years.<ref name=staying>{{cite news|last1=Combs|first1=Marianne|title=Circus Juventas: <U+2018>We<U+2019>re staying in St. Paul<U+2019>|url=http://blogs.mprnews.org/state-of-the-arts/2014/07/circus-juventas-were-staying-in-st-paul/|accessdate=August 1, 2014|work=MPR News|agency=[[Minnesota Public Radio]]|date=July 30, 2014}}</ref> In the meantime, the school is performing a small expansion to their Highland Park space, on which the Circus has a lease for at least 17 more years, as of 2014.<ref name=staying />

==Reception==
Jando Dominique, reporting for ''Spectacle: An Online Journal of Circus Arts'', summarized audience and critical reception for Circus Juventas's shows by describing them as "always sold out and enthusiastically reviewed by the press".<ref name="expanding spectacle" /> Renee Valois cited the age of the performers and the proximity between them and the audience when she asked in a ''St. Paul Pioneer Press'' review of ''Oz'' comparing the circus school with Cirque du Soleil, "Dare I say Circus Juventas is more exciting than the troupe that inspired it?"<ref name=ozwonder>{{cite news|last1=Valois|first1=Renee|title=Circus Juventas' performance of 'Oz' is a wonder|url=http://www.twincities.com/stage/ci_23799191/circus-juventas-performance-oz-is-wonder|accessdate=June 23, 2014|work=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]|date=August 5, 2013}}</ref> Writing for ''Minnesota Monthly'', Amanda Bankston commended the technical skill and professionalism of the performers in 2012's ''Showdown'': "{{nowrap|[T]here}} is nothing child-like about the talent in this show. The budding stars fearlessly swing, flip, and soar through the air like pros."<ref name=youngfearless /> In ''Spectacle'', Dominique noted that Juventas's productions consistently have "a polish and style not often seen in youth circuses, or most professional ones, for that matter."<ref name="expanding spectacle" />

Susannah Schouweiler of Knight Arts wrote, "at two hours and 45 minutes, plus a 20-minute intermission, [''Grimm''{{'s}}] run time is an awfully long haul for the smallest circus-goers."<ref name=knightarts /> Critics have also commented on the occasional misstep in a performance; Rohan Preston noted in his review of ''Grimm'' that "there are moments -- just a few stand out -- when you realize that these are students, after all, in a celebrated after-school program. You want them to succeed, even if they do not always."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Rohan|title=Fairy tales in flight|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/stageandarts/126578298.html|accessdate=June 23, 2014|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=August 2, 2011}}</ref> Similarly, writing for ''BroadwayWorld'', Elaina Lenertz stated, "Sometimes their silks routines are a bit out of sync and sometimes the show features dance routines from younger kids who are still mastering stunts. Despite this, the performance is very impressive."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lenertz|first1=Elaina|title=Circus Juventas' SHOWDOWN Wows Audiences with Pint-Sized Performers|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/minneapolis/article/BWW-Reviews-Circus-Juventas-SHOWDOWN-Wows-Audiences-with-Pint-Sized-Performers-20120822|accessdate=June 23, 2014|work=BroadwayWorld|date=August 22, 2012}}</ref>
