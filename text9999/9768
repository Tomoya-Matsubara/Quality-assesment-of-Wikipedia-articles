'''Red blood cells''', or '''erythrocytes''', are the most common type of [[blood cell]] and the [[vertebrate]] organism's principal means of delivering [[oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) to the body tissues via the [[blood]] flow through the [[circulatory system]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Blood Cells|url=http://www.biosbcc.net/doohan/sample/htm/Blood%20cells.htm}}</ref>  They take up oxygen in the [[lung]]s or [[gill]]s and release it while squeezing through the body's [[capillary|capillaries]].

These cells' [[cytoplasm]] is rich in [[hemoglobin]], an [[iron]]-containing [[biomolecule]] that can bind oxygen and is responsible for the blood's red color. The [[cell membrane]] is composed of proteins and lipids, and this structure provides properties essential for physiological cell function such as [[erythrocyte deformability|deformability]] and [[erythrocyte fragility|stability]] while traversing the circulatory system and specifically the capillary network.

In humans, mature red blood cells are flexible and oval biconcave disks. They lack a [[cell nucleus]] and most [[organelle]]s, in order to accommodate maximum space for haemoglobin. Approximately 2.4 million new erythrocytes are produced per second.<ref name="Sackmann">[[Erich Sackmann]], ''Biological Membranes Architecture and Function.'', Handbook of Biological Physics, (ed. R.Lipowsky and E.Sackmann, vol.1, Elsevier, 1995</ref> The cells develop in the [[bone marrow]] and circulate for about 100<U+2013>120 days in the body before their components are recycled by [[macrophage]]s.  Each circulation takes about 20 seconds. Approximately a quarter of the cells in the human body are red blood cells.<ref name=dean>Laura Dean.

Red blood cells are also known as '''RBCs''', '''red cells''',<ref>{{cite book|title=Robbins Basic Pathology|edition=8th|publisher=Saunders|year=2007|author=Vinay Kumar, Abul K. Abbas, Nelson Fausto, Richard N. Mitchell}}</ref> '''red blood corpuscles''' (an archaic term), '''haematids''', '''erythroid cells'''  or '''erythrocytes''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''erythros'' for "red" and ''kytos'' for "hollow vessel", with ''-cyte'' translated as "cell" in modern usage). [[Packed red blood cells]] (pRBC) are red blood cells that have been donated, processed, and stored in a [[blood bank]] for [[blood transfusion]].

== History ==
The first person to describe red blood cells was the young [[Netherlands|Dutch]] biologist [[Jan Swammerdam]], who had used an early [[microscope]] in 1658 to study the blood of a frog.<ref>"Swammerdam, Jan (1637<U+2013>1680)", McGraw Hill AccessScience, 2007. Accessed 27 December 2007.</ref> Unaware of this work, [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] provided another microscopic description in 1674, this time providing a more precise description of red blood cells, even approximating their size, "25,000 times smaller than a fine grain of sand".

In 1901, [[Karl Landsteiner]] published his discovery of the three main [[ABO blood group system|blood groups]]<U+2014>A, B, and C (which he later renamed to O). Landsteiner described the regular patterns in which reactions occurred when [[blood serum|serum]] was mixed with red blood cells, thus identifying compatible and conflicting combinations between these blood groups. A year later Alfred von Decastello and Adriano Sturli, two colleagues of Landsteiner, identified a fourth blood group<U+2014>AB.

In 1959, by use of [[X-ray crystallography]], Dr. [[Max Perutz]] was able to unravel the [[Hemoglobin#Structure|structure of hemoglobin]], the red blood cell protein that carries oxygen.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/redgold Red Gold <U+2013> Blood History Timeline], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] 2002. Accessed 27 December 2007.</ref>

The oldest intact red blood cells ever discovered were found in [[<U+00D6>tzi the Iceman]], a natural mummy of a man who died around 3255 BCE. These cells were discovered in May 2012.<ref>{{cite news |title='Iceman' mummy holds world's oldest blood cells |author=Stephanie Pappas |date=May 2, 2012 |work=Fox News |url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2012/05/02/iceman-mummy-holds-world-oldest-blood-cells/ |accessdate=May 2, 2012}}</ref>

==Vertebrate erythrocytes==
[[Image:Erythrocytes in vertebrates.jpg|thumb|200px|There is an immense size variation in vertebrate erythrocytes, as well as a correlation between cell and nucleus size. Mammalian erythrocytes, which do not contain nuclei, are considerably smaller than those of most other vertebrates.<ref name="Gulliver1875">{{Cite journal | volume = 1875 | pages = 474<U+2013>495 | last = Gulliver | first = G. | title = On the size and shape of red corpuscles of the blood of vertebrates, with drawings of them to a uniform scale, and extended and revised tables of measurements | journal = Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London | year = 1875 }}</ref>]]

Erythrocytes consist mainly of [[hemoglobin]], a complex [[metalloprotein]] containing [[heme]] groups whose [[iron]] atoms temporarily bind to oxygen molecules (O<sub>2</sub>) in the lungs or gills and release them throughout the body. Oxygen can easily [[diffusion|diffuse]] through the red blood cell's [[cell membrane]]. Hemoglobin in the erythrocytes also carries some of the waste product [[carbon dioxide]] back from the tissues; most waste carbon dioxide, however, is transported back to the [[alveolar-capillary barrier|pulmonary capillaries]] of the [[lung]]s as [[bicarbonate]] (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) dissolved in the [[blood plasma]]. [[Myoglobin]], a compound related to hemoglobin, acts to store oxygen in [[muscle]] cells.<ref>{{cite book | last = Maton  | first = Anthea  | coauthors = Jean Hopkins, Charles William McLaughlin, Susan Johnson, Maryanna Quon Warner, David LaHart, Jill D. Wright  | title = Human Biology and Health  | publisher = Prentice Hall  | year = 1993  | location = Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, USA  | isbn = 0-13-981176-1}}</ref>

The color of erythrocytes is due to the heme group of hemoglobin. The [[blood plasma]] alone is straw-colored, but the red blood cells change color depending on the state of the hemoglobin: when combined with oxygen the resulting oxyhemoglobin is scarlet, and when oxygen has been released the resulting deoxyhemoglobin is of a dark red burgundy color, appearing bluish through the vessel wall and skin. [[Pulse oximetry]] takes advantage of this color change to directly measure the [[artery|arterial]] blood [[oxygen saturation]] using [[colorimetric]] techniques. Hemoglobin also has a very high affinity for [[carbon monoxide]], forming carboxyhaemoglobin which is a very bright red in color. Flushed, confused patients with a saturation reading of 100% on pulse oximetry are sometimes found to be suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning.

The sequestration of oxygen-carrying proteins inside specialized cells (as opposed to oxygen carriers being dissolved in body fluid) was an important step in the evolution of [[vertebrates]] as it allows for less [[viscosity|viscous]] blood, higher concentrations of oxygen, and better diffusion of oxygen from the blood to the tissues. The size of erythrocytes varies widely among vertebrate species; erythrocyte width is on average about 25% larger than [[capillary]] diameter, and it has been hypothesized that this improves the oxygen transfer from erythrocytes to tissues.<ref name=snyder>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1093/icb/39.2.189 |title=Red Blood Cells: Centerpiece in the Evolution of the Vertebrate Circulatory System |year=1999 |last1=Snyder |first1=Gregory K. |last2=Sheafor |first2=Brandon A. |journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology |volume=39 |pages=189 |issue=2}}</ref>

The only known vertebrates without erythrocytes are the crocodile icefishes (family [[Channichthyidae]]); they live in very oxygen-rich cold water and transport oxygen freely dissolved in their blood.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ruud JT |title=Vertebrates without erythrocytes and blood pigment |journal=Nature |volume=173 |issue=4410 |pages=848<U+2013>50 |year=1954 |month=May |pmid=13165664 |doi=10.1038/173848a0|bibcode = 1954Natur.173..848R }}</ref> While they do not use hemoglobin anymore, remnants of hemoglobin genes can be found in their genome.<ref>{{cite book|author=Carroll, Sean|title=The Making of the Fittest|year=2006|publisher=W.W. Norton|isbn=0-393-06163-9|authorlink=Sean B. Carroll}}</ref>

===Nucleus===
Erythrocytes in [[mammal]]s are ''anucleate'' when mature, meaning that they lack a [[cell nucleus]]. In comparison, the erythrocytes of other [[vertebrate]]s have nuclei; the only known exceptions are [[salamander]]s of the ''[[Batrachoseps]]'' genus and fish of the ''[[Maurolicus]]'' genus with closely related species.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01283036 |title=The cytomorphic system of anucleate non-mammalian erythrocytes |year=1982 |last1=Cohen |first1=W. D. |journal=Protoplasma |volume=113 |pages=23}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wingstrand KG |title=Non-nucleated erythrocytes in a teleostean fish Maurolicus m<U+00FC>lleri (Gmelin) |journal=Zeitschrift F<U+00FC>r Zellforschung Und Mikroskopische Anatomie |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=195<U+2013>200 |year=1956 |pmid=13402080 |doi=10.1007/BF00338830 |doi_brokendate=2009-12-02 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/j943833n74065634}}</ref>

The elimination of the nucleus in vertebrate erythrocytes has been offered as an explanation for the subsequent [[C-value enigma|accumulation of non-coding DNA in the genome]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1006/bcmd.2001.0457}}</ref> The argument runs as follows: Efficient gas transport requires erythrocytes to pass through very narrow capillaries, and this constrains their size. In the absence of nuclear elimination, the accumulation of repeat sequences is constrained by the volume occupied by the nucleus, which increases with genome size.

===Secondary functions===
When erythrocytes undergo shear stress in constricted vessels, they release [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], which causes the vessel walls to relax and dilate so as to promote normal blood flow.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wan J, Ristenpart WD, Stone HA |title=Dynamics of shear-induced ATP release from red blood cells |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=105 |issue=43 |pages=16432<U+2013>7 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18922780 |pmc=2575437 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0805779105|bibcode = 2008PNAS..10516432W }}</ref>

When their hemoglobin molecules are deoxygenated, erythrocytes release [[S-Nitrosothiol|S-nitrosothiol]]s, which also act to dilate blood vessels,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Diesen DL, Hess DT, Stamler JS |title=Hypoxic vasodilation by red blood cells: evidence for an s-nitrosothiol-based signal |journal=Circulation Research |volume=103 |issue=5 |pages=545<U+2013>53 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18658051 |pmc=2763414 |doi=10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.176867}}</ref> thus directing more blood to areas of the body depleted of oxygen.

It has been recently demonstrated that erythrocytes can also synthesize [[nitric oxide]] enzymatically, using [[L-arginine]] as substrate, as do [[endothelial cell]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Kleinbongard P |title= Red blood cells express a functional endothelial nitric oxide synthase |journal=Blood|volume=107 |pages=2943<U+2013>51 |year=2006 |pmid= 16368881 |issue= 7 |doi= 10.1182/blood-2005-10-3992 |author-separator= , |author2= Schutz R |author3= Rassaf T |display-authors= 3 |last4= Lauer |first4= T |last5= Dejam |first5= A |last6= Jax |first6= T |last7= Kumara |first7= I |last8= Gharini |first8= P |last9= Kabanova |first9= S }}</ref> Exposure of erythrocytes to physiological levels of shear stress activates [[nitric oxide synthase]] and export of nitric oxide,<ref>{{cite journal |author= Ulker P, Sati L, Celik-Ozenci C, Meiselman HJ, Baskurt OK |title= Mechanical stimulation of nitric oxide synthesizing mechanisms in erythrocytes |journal=Biorheology|volume=46 |pages=121<U+2013>32 |year=2009 |pmid= 19458415 |issue= 2 |doi= 10.3233/BIR-2009-0532 }}</ref> which may contribute to the regulation of vascular tonus.

Erythrocytes can also produce [[hydrogen sulfide]], a signalling gas that acts to relax vessel walls. It is believed that the cardioprotective effects of [[garlic]] are due to erythrocytes converting its sulfur compounds into hydrogen sulfide.<ref>{{Cite journal

Erythrocytes also play a part in the body's [[immune response]]: when [[lysis|lysed]] by pathogens such as bacteria, their hemoglobin releases [[free radical]]s, which break down the pathogen's cell wall and membrane, killing it.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kesava|first=Shobana|title=Red blood cells do more than just carry oxygen; New findings by NUS team show they aggressively attack bacteria too|url=http://www.dbs.nus.edu.sg/events/media/info/2007/dingSTsep07.pdf|accessdate=2013-03-26|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=2007-09-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Jiang N, Tan NS, Ho B, Ding JL |title=Respiratory protein-generated reactive oxygen species as an antimicrobial strategy |journal=Nature Immunology |volume=8 |issue=10 |pages=1114<U+2013>22 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17721536 |doi=10.1038/ni1501}}</ref>

==Mammalian erythrocytes==
[[Image:Gray453.png|thumb|300px|Typical mammalian erythrocytes: (a) seen from surface; (b) in profile, forming rouleaux; (c) rendered spherical by water; (d) rendered crenate by salt. (c) and (d) do not normally occur in the body.]]

[[Mammalian]] erythrocytes are unique among the vertebrates as they are non-nucleated cells in their mature form. These cells have [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] during early phases of [[erythropoiesis]], but extrude them during development as they mature in order to provide more space for hemoglobin. In mammals, erythrocytes also lose all other cellular [[organelle]]s such as their [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]], [[Golgi apparatus]] and [[endoplasmic reticulum]].

As a result of not containing [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]], these cells use none of the oxygen they transport; instead they produce the energy carrier [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] by the [[glycolysis]] of [[glucose]] and [[lactic acid fermentation]] on the resulting [[pyruvate]].

Because of the lack of nuclei and organelles, mature red blood cells do not contain [[DNA]] and cannot synthesize any [[RNA]], and consequently cannot divide and have limited repair capabilities.<ref name="Kabanova2009">{{cite journal |author=Kabanova S, Kleinbongard P, Volkmer J, Andr<U+00E9>e B, Kelm M, Jax TW |title=Gene expression analysis of human red blood cells |journal=International Journal of Medical Sciences |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=156<U+2013>9 |year=2009 |pmid=19421340 |pmc=2677714 |url=http://www.medsci.org/v06p0156.htm}}</ref> This also ensures that no [[virus]] can evolve to target mammalian red blood cells.<ref>{{cite news|last=Zimmer|first=Carl|title=Scientists Explore Ways to Lure Viruses to Their Death|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/27/science/27viral.html|accessdate=2013-03-26|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2007-03-27}}</ref> 

Mammalian erythrocytes are typically shaped as biconcave disks: flattened and depressed in the center, with a dumbbell-shaped cross section, and a [[torus]]-shaped rim on the edge of the disk. This distinctive biconcave shape optimises the <U+FB02>ow properties of blood in the large vessels, such as maximization of [[laminar flow]] and minimization of platelet scatter, which suppresses their [[atherogenic]] activity in those large vessels.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Uzoigwe C |title=The human erythrocyte has developed the biconcave disc shape to optimise the flow properties of the blood in the large vessels |journal=Medical Hypotheses |volume=67 |issue=5 |pages=1159<U+2013>63 |year=2006 |pmid=16797867 |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2004.11.047}}</ref> However, there are some exceptions concerning shape in the [[artiodactyl]] order (even-toed [[ungulates]] including cattle, deer, and their relatives), which displays a wide variety of bizarre erythrocyte morphologies: small and highly ovaloid cells in [[llamas]] and [[camels]] (family [[Camelidae]]), tiny spherical cells in mouse deer (family [[Tragulidae]]), and cells which assume fusiform, lanceolate, crescentic, and irregularly polygonal and other angular forms in red deer and wapiti (family [[Cervidae]]).

In large blood vessels, red blood cells sometimes occur as a stack, flat side next to flat side. This is known as ''[[rouleaux]] formation'', and it occurs more often if the levels of certain serum proteins are elevated, as for instance during [[inflammation]].

The [[spleen]] acts as a reservoir of red blood cells, but this effect is somewhat limited in humans. In some other mammals such as [[dog]]s and [[horse]]s, the spleen sequesters large numbers of red blood cells which are dumped into the blood during times of exertion stress, yielding a higher oxygen transport capacity.

Adult humans have roughly [[1 E12|2<U+2013>3 &times; 10<sup>13</sup>]] (20<U+2013>30 trillion) red blood cells at any given time, comprising approximately one quarter of the total human body cell number (women have about 4 to 5 million erythrocytes per [[liter|microliter]] (cubic millimeter) of blood and men about 5 to 6 million; [[Effects_of_high_altitude_on_humans#Acclimatization_to_altitude|people living at high altitudes]] with low oxygen tension will have more). Red blood cells are thus much more common than the other blood particles: there are about 4,000<U+2013>11,000 [[white blood cells]] and about 150,000<U+2013>400,000 [[platelet]]s in each microliter of human blood.

As red blood cells contain no nucleus, [[protein biosynthesis]] is currently assumed to be absent in these cells, although a recent study indicates the presence of all the necessary biomachinery in the cells to do so.<ref name="Kabanova2009"/>

The blood's red color is due to the spectral properties of the [[heme|hemic]] [[iron]] [[ion]]s in [[hemoglobin]]. Each human red blood cell contains approximately 270 million of these [[hemoglobin]] biomolecules, each carrying four heme groups; hemoglobin comprises about a third of the total cell volume. This protein is responsible for the transport of more than 98% of the oxygen (the remaining oxygen is carried dissolved in the [[blood plasma]]). The red blood cells of an average adult human male store collectively about 2.5 grams of [[iron]], representing about 65% of the total iron contained in the body.<ref>[http://www.med-ed.virginia.edu/courses/path/innes/nh/iron.cfm Iron Metabolism], University of Virginia Pathology.

Bridges, Information Center for Sickle Cell and Thalassemic Disorders. Accessed 22 September 2007.</ref> (See [[Human iron metabolism]].)

===Life cycle===
Human erythrocytes are produced through a process named [[erythropoiesis]], developing from committed [[stem cell]]s to mature erythrocytes in about 7 days. When matured, in a healthy individual these cells live in blood circulation for about 100 to 120 days (and 80 to 90 days in a full term [[infant]]).<ref>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1440-1754.1979.tb01197.x}}</ref> At the end of their lifespan, they become senescent, and are removed from circulation by the liver. In many chronic diseases, the lifespan of the erythrocytes is markedly reduced (e.g. patients requiring [[haemodialysis]]).

====Erythropoiesis====
[[Erythropoiesis]] is the development process by which new erythrocytes are produced; it lasts about 7 days. Through this process erythrocytes are continuously produced in the red [[bone marrow]] of large bones, at a rate of about 2 million per second in a healthy adult. (In the [[embryo]], the [[liver]] is the main site of red blood cell production.) The production can be stimulated by the [[hormone]] [[erythropoietin]] (EPO), synthesised by the kidney. Just before and after leaving the bone marrow, the developing cells are known as [[reticulocyte]]s; these comprise about 1% of circulating red blood cells.

====Functional lifetime====
The functional lifetime of an erythrocyte is about 100<U+2013>120 days, during which time the erythrocytes are continually moved by the blood flow push (in [[arteries]]), pull (in [[veins]]) and a combination of the two as they squeeze through microvessels such as capillaries.

====Senescence====
The aging erythrocyte undergoes changes in its [[plasma membrane]], making it susceptible to selective recognition by [[macrophage]]s and subsequent [[phagocytosis]] in the [[reticuloendothelial system]] ([[spleen]], [[liver]] and [[bone marrow]]), thus removing old and defective cells and continually purging the blood. This process is termed eryptosis, erythrocyte programmed cell death.<ref name=Lang2012>{{cite journal|authors=Lang F, Lang E, F<U+00F6>ller M|year=2012|title=Physiology and pathophysiology of eryptosis|journal=Transfusion Medicine and Hemotherapy|volume=39|number=5|pages=308<U+2013>314|pmc=3678267}}</ref> This process normally occurs at the same rate of production by erythropoiesis, balancing the total circulating red blood cell count. Eryptosis is increased in a wide variety of diseases including [[sepsis]], [[haemolytic uremic syndrome]], [[malaria]], [[sickle cell anemia]], beta-[[thalassemia]], [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], phosphate depletion, iron deficiency and [[Wilson's disease]]. Eryptosis can be elicited by osmotic shock, oxidative stress, energy depletion as well as a wide variety of endogenous mediators and xenobiotics. Excessive eryptosis is observed in erythrocytes lacking the cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I or the AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK. [[Enzyme inhibitor|Inhibitor]]s of eryptosis include [[erythropoietin]], [[nitric oxide]], [[catecholamine]]s and high concentrations of [[urea]].

Much of the resulting breakdown products are recirculated in the body. The heme constituent of hemoglobin are broken down into Fe<sup>3+</sup> and [[biliverdin]]. The biliverdin is reduced to [[bilirubin]], which is released into the plasma and recirculated to the liver bound to [[albumin]].  The iron is released into the plasma to be recirculated by a carrier protein called [[transferrin]].  Almost all erythrocytes are removed in this manner from the circulation before they are old enough to [[Hemolysis|hemolyze]]. Hemolyzed hemoglobin is bound to a protein in plasma called [[haptoglobin]], which is not excreted by the kidney.<ref>{{cite journal |author=F<U+00F6>ller M, Huber SM, Lang F |title=Erythrocyte programmed cell death |journal=IUBMB Life |volume=60 |issue=10 |pages=661<U+2013>8 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18720418 |doi=10.1002/iub.106}}</ref>

===Membrane composition===
The [[cell membrane|membrane]] of the red blood cell plays many roles that aid in regulating their surface deformability, flexibility, adhesion to other cells and immune recognition. These functions are highly dependent on its composition, which defines its properties. The red blood cell membrane is composed of 3 layers: the [[glycocalyx]] on the exterior, which is rich in [[carbohydrates]]; the [[lipid bilayer]] which contains many [[transmembrane protein]]s, besides its lipidic main constituents; and the membrane skeleton, a structural network of proteins located on the inner surface of the lipid bilayer. Half of the membrane mass in human and most mammalian erythrocytes are proteins.  The other half are lipids, namely [[phospholipid]]s and [[cholesterol]].<ref name="Yazdanbakhsh2000">{{cite journal |author=Yazdanbakhsh K, Lomas-Francis C, Reid ME |title=Blood groups and diseases associated with inherited abnormalities of the red blood cell membrane |journal=Transfusion Medicine Reviews |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=364<U+2013>74 |year=2000 |month=October |pmid=11055079 |doi=10.1053/tmrv.2000.16232}}</ref>

====Membrane lipids====
[[Image:Erythrocyte Membrane lipids.jpg|thumb|250px|The most common erythrocyte cell membrane lipids, schematically disposed as they are distributed on the bilayer. Relative abundances are not at scale.]]
The erythrocyte cell membrane comprises a typical [[lipid bilayer]], similar to what can be found in virtually all human cells. Simply put, this lipid bilayer is composed of [[cholesterol]] and [[phospholipid]]s in equal proportions by weight. The lipid composition is important as it defines many physical properties such as membrane permeability and fluidity. Additionally, the activity of many membrane proteins is regulated by interactions with lipids in the bilayer.

Unlike cholesterol, which is evenly distributed between the inner and outer leaflets, the 5 major phospholipids are asymmetrically disposed, as shown below:

'''Outer monolayer'''
* [[Phosphatidylcholine]] (PC);
* [[Sphingomyelin]] (SM).

'''Inner monolayer'''
* [[Phosphatidylethanolamine]] (PE);
* [[Phosphoinositol]] (PI) (small amounts).
* [[Phosphatidylserine]] (PS);

This asymmetric phospholipid distribution among the bilayer is the result of the function of several energy-dependent and energy-independent [[phospholipid]] transport proteins. Proteins called <U+201C>[[Flippase]]s<U+201D> move phospholipids from the outer to the inner monolayer, while others called <U+201C>[[floppase]]s<U+201D> do the opposite operation, against a concentration gradient in an energy dependent manner. Additionally, there are also <U+201C>[[scramblase]]<U+201D> proteins that move phospholipids in both directions at the same time, down their concentration gradients in an energy independent manner. There is still considerable debate ongoing regarding the identity of these membrane maintenance proteins in the red cell membrane.

The maintenance of an asymmetric phospholipid distribution in the bilayer (such as an exclusive localization of PS and PIs in the inner monolayer) is critical for the cell integrity and function due to several reasons:

* [[Macrophages]] recognize and [[phagocytose]] red cells that expose PS at their outer surface. Thus the confinement of PS in the inner monolayer is essential if the cell is to survive its frequent encounters with macrophages of the [[reticuloendothelial system]], especially in the [[spleen]].

* Premature destruction of [[Thalassemia|thallassemic]] and sickle red cells has been linked to disruptions of lipid asymmetry leading to exposure of PS on the outer monolayer.

* An exposure of PS can potentiate adhesion of red cells to vascular endothelial cells, effectively preventing normal transit through the microvasculature. Thus it is important that PS is maintained only in the inner leaflet of the bilayer to ensure normal blood flow in microcirculation.

* Both PS and [[PIP2|phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate]] (PIP2) can regulate membrane mechanical function, due to their interactions with skeletal proteins such as [[spectrin]] and [[Band 4.1|protein 4.1R]]. Recent studies have shown that binding of spectrin to PS promotes membrane mechanical stability. PIP2 enhances the binding of [[Band 4.1|protein band 4.1R]] to [[glycophorin C]] but decreases its interaction with [[Band 3|protein band 3]], and thereby may modulate the linkage of the bilayer to the membrane skeleton.

The presence of specialized structures named "[[lipid rafts]]" in the erythrocyte membrane have been described by recent studies. These are structures enriched in [[cholesterol]] and [[sphingolipids]] associated with specific membrane proteins, namely [[FLOT1|flotillin]]s, [[STOM|stomatin]]s (band 7), [[G-proteins]], and [[Beta-adrenergic receptor|<U+03B2>-adrenergic receptor]]s. [[Lipid rafts]] that have been implicated in cell signaling events in nonerythroid cells have been shown in erythroid cells to mediate [[Beta-adrenergic receptor|<U+03B2>2-adregenic receptor]] signaling and increase [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] levels, and thus regulating entry of [[malaria]]l parasites into normal red cells.<ref name="Mohandas2008">{{cite journal |author=Mohandas N, Gallagher PG |title=Red cell membrane: past, present, and future |journal=Blood |volume=112 |issue=10 |pages=3939<U+2013>48 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=18988878 |pmc=2582001 |doi=10.1182/blood-2008-07-161166}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Rodi PM, Trucco VM, Gennaro AM |title=Factors determining detergent resistance of erythrocyte membranes |journal=Biophysical Chemistry |volume=135 |issue=1<U+2013>3 |pages=14<U+2013>8 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18394774 |doi=10.1016/j.bpc.2008.02.015}}</ref>

====Membrane proteins====

The proteins of the membrane skeleton are responsible for the deformability, flexibility and durability of the red blood cell, enabling it to squeeze through capillaries less than half the diameter of the erythrocyte (7<U+2013>8 <U+03BC>m) and recovering the discoid shape as soon as these cells stop receiving compressive forces, in a similar fashion to an object made of rubber.

There are currently more than 50 known membrane proteins, which can exist in a few hundred up to a million copies per erythrocyte. Approximately 25 of these membrane proteins carry the various blood group antigens, such as the A, B and Rh antigens, among many others. These membrane proteins can perform a wide diversity of functions, such as transporting ions and molecules across the red cell membrane, adhesion and interaction with other cells such as endothelial cells, as signaling receptors, as well as other currently unknown functions. The [[blood type]]s of humans are due to variations in surface [[glycoprotein]]s of erythrocytes. Disorders of the proteins in these membranes are associated with many disorders, such as [[hereditary spherocytosis]], [[hereditary elliptocytosis]], [[hereditary stomatocytosis]], and [[paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]].<ref name="Yazdanbakhsh2000"/><ref name="Mohandas2008"/>

===Surface electrostatic potential===
The [[zeta potential]] is an electrochemical property of cell surfaces that is determined by the net electrical charge of molecules exposed at the surface of cell membranes of the cell. The normal zeta potential of the erythrocyte is <U+2212>15.7 milli[[volt]]s (mV).<ref name=Tokumasu2012>Tokumasu F, Ostera GR, Amaratunga C, Fairhurst RM (2012) Modifications in erythrocyte membrane zeta potential by ''Plasmodium falciparum'' infection. Exp Parasitol</ref> Much of this potential appears to be contributed by the exposed [[sialic acid]] residues in the membrane: their removal results in zeta potential of <U+2212>6.06 mV.

==Clinical notes==
===Separation and blood doping===
Red blood cells can be obtained from [[whole blood]] by [[centrifugation]], which separates the cells from the [[blood plasma]] in a process known as [[blood fractionation]]. [[Packed red blood cells]], which are made in this way from whole blood with the plasma removed, are used in [[transfusion medicine]].<ref>{{cite web|format=pdf|url=http://www.aabb.org/resources/bct/Documents/coi0809r.pdf|title=Circular of Information for Blood and Blood Products|publisher=American Association of Blood Banks, American Red Cross, America's Blood Centers|accessdate=2010-11-01}}</ref> During [[blood donation|plasma donation]], the red blood cells are pumped back into the body right away and only the plasma is collected. 

Some athletes have tried to improve their performance by [[blood doping]]: first about 1 litre of their blood is extracted, then the red blood cells are isolated, frozen and stored, to be reinjected shortly before the competition. (Red blood cells can be conserved for 5 weeks at <U+2212>79 <U+00B0>C.) This practice is hard to detect but may endanger the human [[cardiovascular system]] which is not equipped to deal with blood of the resulting higher [[viscosity]]. Another method of blood doping involves injection with [[erythropoietin]] in order to stimulate production of red blood cells.  Both practices are banned by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]].

===Artificially grown red blood cells===
In 2008 it was reported that human [[embryonic stem cell]]s had been successfully coaxed into becoming erythrocytes in the lab. The difficult step was to induce the cells to eject their nucleus; this was achieved by growing the cells on [[stromal cell]]s from the bone marrow. It is hoped that these artificial erythrocytes can eventually be used for blood transfusions.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14565-first-red-blood-cells-grown-in-the-lab.html First red blood cells grown in the lab], ''New Scientist News'', 19 August 2008</ref>

== Diseases and diagnostic tools ==
[[Image:Sicklecells.jpg|frame|right|Affected by [[Sickle-cell disease]], red blood cells alter shape and threaten to damage internal organs.]]

[[Blood diseases]] involving the red blood cells include:
* [[Anemia]]s (or anaemias) are diseases characterized by low oxygen transport capacity of the blood, because of low red cell count or some abnormality of the red blood cells or the hemoglobin.

:* [[Iron deficiency anemia]] is the most common anemia; it occurs when the dietary intake or absorption of [[iron]] is insufficient, and hemoglobin, which contains iron, cannot be formed

:* [[Sickle-cell disease]] is a genetic disease that results in abnormal hemoglobin molecules. When these release their oxygen load in the tissues, they become insoluble, leading to mis-shaped red blood cells. These sickle shaped red cells are less deformable and [[Blood Viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] meaning that they have become rigid and can cause blood vessel blockage, pain, strokes, and other tissue damage.

:* [[Thalassemia]] is a genetic disease that results in the production of an abnormal ratio of hemoglobin subunits.

:*[[Hereditary spherocytosis]] syndromes are a group of inherited disorders characterized by defects in the red blood cell's [[cell membrane]], causing the cells to be small, sphere-shaped, and fragile instead of donut-shaped and flexible. These abnormal red blood cells are destroyed by the [[spleen]]. Several other hereditary disorders of the red blood cell membrane are known.<ref>{{cite journal |author=An X, Mohandas N |title=Disorders of red cell membrane |journal=British Journal of Haematology |volume=141 |issue=3 |pages=367<U+2013>75 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18341630 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07091.x}}</ref>

:* [[Pernicious anemia]] is an [[autoimmune disease]] wherein the body lacks [[intrinsic factor]], required to absorb [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] from food. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is needed for the production of hemoglobin.

:* [[Aplastic anemia]] is caused by the inability of the [[bone marrow]] to produce blood cells.

:* [[Pure red cell aplasia]] is caused by the inability of the bone marrow to produce only red blood cells.

[[File:Human Erythrocytes OsmoticPressure PhaseContrast Plain.svg|thumb|right|Micrographs of the effects of osmotic pressure]]
* [[Hemolysis]] is the general term for excessive breakdown of red blood cells. It can have several causes and can result in [[hemolytic anemia]].

:* The [[malaria]] parasite spends part of its life-cycle in red blood cells, feeds on their hemoglobin and then breaks them apart, causing fever. Both [[sickle-cell disease]] and [[thalassemia]] are more common in malaria areas, because these mutations convey some protection against the parasite.

* [[Polycythemia]]s (or erythrocytoses) are diseases characterized by a surplus of red blood cells. The increased viscosity of the blood can cause a number of symptoms.

:* In [[polycythemia vera]] the increased number of red blood cells results from an abnormality in the bone marrow.

* Several [[microangiopathy|microangiopathic diseases]], including [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] and [[thrombotic microangiopathies]], present with [[pathognomonic]] (diagnostic) red blood cell fragments called [[schistocyte]]s. These pathologies generate [[fibrin]] strands that sever red blood cells as they try to move past a [[thrombus]].

* [[Transfusion reaction|Hemolytic transfusion reaction]] is the destruction of donated red blood cells after a transfusion, mediated by host antibodies, often as a result of a blood type mismatch.

Several [[blood test]]s involve red blood cells, including the ''RBC count'' (the number of red blood cells per volume of blood), the [[hematocrit]] (percentage of blood volume occupied by red blood cells), and the [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]]. Many diseases involving red blood cells are diagnosed with a [[blood film]] (or peripheral blood smear), where a thin layer of blood is smeared on a microscope slide. The [[blood type]] needs to be determined to prepare for a [[blood transfusion]] or an [[organ transplantation]].
