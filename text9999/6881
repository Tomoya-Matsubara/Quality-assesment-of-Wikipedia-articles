===The Falklands War===
On [[June 8]] [[1982]], he was with other members of his regiment on the ship the [[RFA Sir Galahad (1966)|RFA ''Sir Galahad'']] in [[Bluff Cove]], just off the [[Falkland Islands]], when it was bombed and set on fire by enemy [[A-4 Skyhawk|Skyhawk]] fighters. The ship was carrying ammunition including phosphoric bombs and thousands of gallons of diesel and petrol.<ref name="ADSW ">{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:Aa_fMCPWg2EJ:www.adsw.org.uk/documents/conference/Simon%2520Weston%25202003%2520Conference.doc+%22simon+weston%22&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=3&gl=uk&client=firefox-a|title=Keynote Speech to ADSW Annual Conference|date=2003-05-21|publisher=adsw.org.uk|accessdate=2008-06-17}}</ref> Twenty-two out of his platoon of thirty men were killed; altogether the Welsh Guards lost forty-eight men and ninety-seven were injured.<ref name="ADSW " />

Weston survived with 49% burns, following which his face was barely recognisable:
{{Cquote|My first encounter with a really low point was when they wheeled me into the transit hospital at RAF Lyneham and I passed my mother in the corridor and she said to my gran, "Oh mam, look at that poor boy" and I cried out "Mam, it's me!" And as she recognised my voice her face turned to stone.|||Simon Weston|<ref name="ADSW " />}}
