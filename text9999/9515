'''William Nichols''' (1780-December 12, 1853) was an [[England|English]]-born [[architect]] who emigrated to the [[United States]] and became most famous for his early [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style buildings in the [[Southern United States|American South]].  He is best known for designing early [[statehouse]]s for [[North Carolina]], [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]].<ref name="ncarchitects">{{cite web |url=http://ncarchitects.lib.ncsu.edu/people/P000026 |title=Nichols, William (1780-1853) |work= North Carolina Architects and Builders: A Biographical Directory |publisher= The NCSU Libraries Digital Scholarship and Publishing Center|accessdate=2009-11-29}}</ref><ref name="alheritage">{{cite journal |last1=Mellown  |first1=Robert O. |year= 2005 |title=Variations on a Capitol Plan |journal=Alabama Heritage |volume=Summer 2005 |issue=77 |pages= |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4113/is_200507/ai_n14779001/?tag=content;col1 }}</ref>

== Biography ==
William Nichols was born in 1780 in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], a center for [[Palladian architecture#English Palladian revival (neo-Palladian)|English Palladian]] and [[Adam style|Adam]] style architecture in the 18th century. He was brought up in a family of builders, learning the trade through them.  Nichols emigrated to North Carolina in 1800, initially settling in [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] area. He married Mary Rew in 1805 and had taken his first apprentice by 1806. His earliest commissions in the area remain unclear, although several buildings have been suggested as candidates.  He applied for American citizenship in 1813, and in 1815, following the death of his first wife, married Sarah Simons.<ref name="ncarchitects"/><ref name="alheritage"/>

In 1818 Nichols was employed as North Carolina's State Architect and Superintendent of Public Buildings.  This made him responsible for new state buildings and for repairs and improvements to existing ones.  One of his early jobs in this capacity is believed by scholars to be the addition of an [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[portico]] to the Governor's Palace in [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]].  His most important commission during this time, however, was a complete remodeling of the old North Carolina State House, completed in 1822.  Incorporating Palladian and early [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] elements, it included a new central rotunda surmounted by a dome.  The Senate chamber and House of Commons both included galleries supported by Ionic columns.  Widely admired at the time, it drew the praise of fellow architect [[Ithiel Town]].  Nichols was involved in numerous private projects during this time, as well as projects at the [[University of North Carolina]].<ref name="ncarchitects"/>

Nichols relocated to Alabama in 1827, after receiving a commission from the legislature there to become the new state architect and build a state capitol building in the new capital of [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]].  The new capitol building was [[cruciform]] in plan, the second and third floors resting upon a high rusticated stone basement.  The main eastern facade featured a gabled pseudo-portico with Ionic columns.  The ground level contained main entrances, with identical north and south one-story porticoes supported by [[Doric order|Doric]] columns, each column carved from a single shaft of sandstone.  A dome surmounted the central rotunda and was topped by a lantern that admitted light into the space.<ref name="alheritage"/>  While working on the statehouse, Nichols also designed the campus for the newly established [[University of Alabama]].  Influenced by [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s plan at the [[University of Virginia]], the campus featured a {{convert|70|ft|sing=on}} wide by {{convert|70|ft|sing=on}} high domed [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] building that served as the library and nucleus of the campus.  This, and all but one of Nichols structures, was burned by the [[Union Army]] on April 4, 1865.<ref name="alheritage2">{{cite journal |last1=Center  |first1=Clark E. |year= 1990 |title=The Burning of the University of Alabama |journal=Alabama Heritage |volume=Spring 1990 |issue=16 |pages=30-45|url=http://www.alabamaheritage.com/vault/UAburning.htm }}</ref>

In 1833, with a letter of recommendation from his friend, Alabama Governor [[John Gayle (Alabama)|John Gayle]], Nichols applied for the post of state architect for Mississippi.  Although he didn't receive the job at time, he was later summoned to [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] in 1835 to fill the post and assume construction of the [[Old Mississippi State Capitol|new Mississippi capitol]].  The configuration and ornament on the new building reflected his earlier state houses in North Carolina and Alabama, only with a more monumental scale.  The Old Mississippi State Capitol is the only one of the Nichol's three state houses to survive, North Carolina's burned in 1831 during roof repairs. The capital of Alabama moved to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] in 1845, the old capitol building became the Alabama Central Female College in 1857.  It fulfilled that role until it too burned on August 22, 1923 during renovations.<ref name="alheritage"/>  Nichol's Mississippi capitol building
