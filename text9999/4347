'''Camp Paxson Boy Scout Camp (24MO77)''', located on the shore of [[Seeley Lake, Montana|Seeley Lake]], [[Lolo National Forest|Lolo National Forest, Montana]], is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and started out as a summer camp for the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA). The [[United States Forest Service]] granted the Western Montana Council of the BSA to build a summer camp, originally with six small structures and tents, in 1924. More space was needed and in 1939 more facilities were begun by the [[Works Progress Administration]] and [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC). They were completed in 1940 under the supervision of Forest Service engineer Clyde Fickes. There are twenty buildings constructed out notched [[Larix occidentalis|Western Larch]] logs. Uncut native stone was used for the fireplaces. The site has also been used by the United States Forest Service as a [[smokejumper]] school for [[conscientious objector]]s in the [[Civilian Public Service|Civilian Public Service Program]] during [[World War II]].<ref name="smoke" /><ref name="mark" /> This smokejumper program operated from May 1943 to April 1946 and was known as "CPS Camp No. 103".<ref name="cps" /> It is the only CCC-constructed youth camp in Montana.<ref name="mct" /> 

The site became a training camp for the [[Missoula Children's Theatre]] in 1995 and now has {{convert|15|acre|ha}}. It is also used for activities such as family reunions and weddings.<ref name="mct" />
