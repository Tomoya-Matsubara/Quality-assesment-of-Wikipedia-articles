He is currently working on a sequel, covering his life and career since then.

Rice was made a [[Knight Bachelor]] by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1994<ref name="dis">[http://legends.disney.go.com/legends/detail?key=Sir+Tim+Rice Disney Legends <U+2014> Sir Tim Rice]</ref> (entitling him to the address "Sir Tim Rice" or "Sir Tim"), was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1999, and was named a [[Disney Legend]] in 2002.<ref name="dis"/>

==Personal life==
Rice married Jane McIntosh on 19 August 1974, but the marriage dissolved in the late-1980s after the British tabloid newspapers revealed that he had been conducting an affair with actress/singer [[Elaine Paige]].<ref>Hastings, Christopher.

Describing his religion, Rice has stated, <U+201C>Technically I'm Church of England, which is really nothing. But I don't follow it. I wouldn't say I was a Christian. I have nothing against it." Conversely, he also stated that he adapted the Biblical stories of Joseph and Jesus to musicals because "I'd always rather take a true story over an untrue one."<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19821127&id=uzwsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4s4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6254,6671012 "Lyricist is Unreligious"]</ref>

Rice runs his own amateur Heartaches Cricket Club, the name inspired by an [[Elvis Presley]] song.<ref>Viner, Brian.
