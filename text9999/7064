'''''Last Hero in China''''' is a 1993 Hong Kong film written and directed by [[Wong Jing]]. It is a derivative of the ''[[Once Upon a Time in China (film series)|Once Upon a Time in China]]'' film series, and unlike other imitations, it can be considered a spin-off or parody to some extent.{{cn|date=January 2012}} It was released after the first three films in the ''Once Upon a Time in China'' franchise. The film starred [[Jet Li]] as Chinese folk hero [[Wong Fei-hung]] and the action choreography was done by [[Yuen Woo-ping]]. However ''Last Hero in China'' differs greatly in tone from the ''Once Upon a Time in China'' films as it contains stronger elements of violence and broader, more [[slapstick]], comedy.{{cn|date=January 2012}}

Wong Fei-Hung has now his own school of Kung fu, but the latter becomes too small for his numerous student. Two of his followers succeed in finding an agreement with the owner of an idle house. The school thus changes location... Unfortunately, the school of Fei-Hung is next to a "love hotel", what is for him unacceptable. Furthermore, a new general wants absolutely his loss, and it is true to give free rein to his traffics...
