The '''Bay of Pigs Invasion''' was an unsuccessful action by a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-trained force of [[Cuban exile]]s to invade southern Cuba, with support and encouragement from the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]], in an attempt to overthrow the [[Politics of Cuba|Cuban government]] of [[Fidel Castro]]. The invasion was launched in April 1961, less than three months after [[John F. Kennedy]] assumed the [[President of the United States|presidency in the United States]]. The [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces|Cuban armed forces]], trained and equipped by [[Eastern Bloc]] nations, defeated the invading combatants within three days.

The main invasion landing took place at a beach named [[Playa Gir<U+00F3>n]], located at the mouth of the bay. The invasion is named after the [[Bay of Pigs]], although that is only a modern translation of the Spanish ''Bah<U+00ED>a de Cochinos''. In Latin America, the conflict is often known as '''La Batalla de Gir<U+00F3>n''', or just '''Playa Gir<U+00F3>n'''.

==Political background==
On 17 March 1960, American president [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight Eisenhower]] approved a document prepared by the [[5412 Committee]] (also known as the "Special Group"), at a meeting of the [[US National Security Council]] (NSC). The stated first objective of the plan began as follows:<ref>FRUS VI, p. 850</ref><blockquote>A Program of Covert Action Against the Castro Regime<br />1. Objective: The purpose of the program outlined herein is to bring about the replacement of the Castro regime with one more devoted to the true interests of the Cuban people and more acceptable to the U.S. in such a manner to avoid any appearance of U.S. intervention.</blockquote>

On 18 August 1960, President Eisenhower approved a budget of $13 million for the operation. By 31 October 1960, most guerrilla infiltrations and supply drops directed by the CIA into Cuba had failed, and developments of further guerrilla strategies were replaced by plans to mount an initial amphibious assault, with a minimum of 1,500 men. On 18 November 1960, [[Allen Welsh Dulles|Allen Dulles]] ([[Director of Central Intelligence|CIA Director]]) and [[Richard M. Bissell, Jr.|Richard Bissell]] (CIA Deputy Director for Plans) first briefed President-elect John Kennedy on the outline plans. Having experience in actions such as the [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'<U+00E9>tat]], Dulles was confident that the CIA was capable of overthrowing the Cuban government as led by [[List of Prime Ministers of Cuba|Prime Minister]] Fidel Castro since 16 February 1959. On 29 November 1960, President Eisenhower met with the chiefs of the CIA, Defense, State and Treasury departments to discuss the new concept. No objections were expressed, and Eisenhower approved the plans, with the intention of persuading John Kennedy of their merit. On 8 December 1960, Bissell presented outline plans to the "Special Group" while declining to commit details to written records. Further development of the plans continued, and on 4 January 1961 they consisted of an intention to carry out a "lodgement" by 750 men at an undisclosed site in Cuba, supported by considerable air power.<ref name=gleijeses>Gleijeses (1995)</ref>{{rp|9-19}}

On 28 January 1961, President Kennedy was briefed, together with all the major departments, on the latest plan (code-named ''Operation Pluto'') that involved 1,000 men to be landed in a ship-borne invasion at [[Trinidad, Cuba]], about 270&nbsp;km (170&nbsp;mi) south-east of [[Havana]], at the foothills of the [[Escambray Mountains]] in [[Sancti Spiritus]] province. Kennedy authorized the active departments to continue, and to report progress.<ref name=gleijeses/>{{rp|20}} Trinidad had good port facilities, it was closer to many existing counter-revolutionary activities, it had an easily defensible beachhead, and it offered an escape route into the Escambray Mountains. When that scheme was subsequently rejected by the State Department, the CIA went on to propose an alternative plan. On 4 April 1961, President Kennedy then approved the Bay of Pigs plan (also known as ''Operation Zapata''), because it had an airfield that would not need to be extended to handle bomber operations, it was farther away from large groups of civilians than the Trinidad plan, and it was less "noisy" militarily, which would make any future denial of direct US involvement more plausible. The invasion landing area was changed to beaches bordering the Bah<U+00ED>a de Cochinos (Bay of Pigs) in [[Las Villas Province]], 150&nbsp;km south-east of Havana, and east of the Zapata peninsula. The landings were to take place at Playa Gir<U+00F3>n (code-named ''Blue Beach''), Playa Larga (code-named ''Red Beach''), and Caleta Buena Inlet (code-named ''Green Beach'').<ref name=jones>Jones (2008)</ref><ref name=higgins>Higgins (2008)</ref><ref name=faria>Faria (2002), pp. 93-98.</ref><ref name=kornbluh>Kornbluh (1998)</ref>

In March 1961, the CIA helped Cuban exiles in Miami to create the [[Cuban Revolutionary Council]] (CRC), chaired by [[Jos<U+00E9> Mir<U+00F3> Cardona]], former Prime Minister of Cuba in January 1959. Cardona became the de facto leader-in-waiting of the intended post-invasion Cuban government.<ref>Bethell (1993)</ref>

==Existing anti-Castro resistance in Cuba==
After the success of the [[Cuban Revolution]] in January 1959, counter-revolutionary groups grew, particularly in the Escambray Mountains, where the [[War Against the Bandits]] guerrilla war continued sporadically until 1965. Prior to the invasion, the CIA supported and supplied various groups with arms and other resources, but they were not included in the invasion plans due to concerns about information security.<ref name=jones/>{{rp|64}} [[No quarter]] was given during the suppression of the resistance in the Escambray Mountains, where former rebels from the War Against Batista took different sides.<ref>Dreke (2002), pp. 40<U+2013>117.</ref> On 11 March 1961, Jesus Carreras and American [[William Alexander Morgan]] (a former Castro ally) were executed after a trial.<ref name=thomas>Thomas (1971)</ref><ref name=nsa/>

On 3 April 1961, a bomb attack on militia barracks in [[Bayamo]] killed four militia, and wounded eight more. On 6 April, the Hershey Sugar factory in Matanzas was destroyed by sabotage.<ref name=corzo>Corzo (2003), pp. 79<U+2013>90</ref> On 14 April 1961, guerrillas led by Agapito Rivera fought Cuban government forces near Las Cruces, Montembo, Las Villas, where several government troops were killed and others wounded.<ref name=corzo/> Also on 14 April 1961, a [[Cubana de Aviaci<U+00F3>n S.A.|Cubana]] airliner was hijacked and flown to [[Jacksonville, Florida]]; resultant confusion then helped discovery of the staged 'defection' of a B-26 and pilot at Miami on 15 April.<ref name=fernandez/><ref name=schlesinger/>{{rp|245}}

==Preparation and training for invasion==
In April 1960, the CIA began to recruit anti-Castro Cuban exiles in the Miami area. Until July 1960, assessment and training was carried out on [[Useppa Island]] and at various other facilities in South Florida, such as [[Homestead AFB]]. Specialist guerrilla training took place at [[Fort Gulick]], Panama and at [[Fort Clayton]], Panama.<ref name=fernandez>Fernandez (2001)</ref><ref name=rodriguez>Rodriguez (1999)</ref>{{rp|78}} For the increasing ranks of recruits, infantry training was carried out at a CIA-run base (code-named ''JMTrax'') near [[Retalhuleu]] in the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas|Sierra Madre]] on the Pacific coast of [[Guatemala]].<ref name=johnson/> The exiles group named themselves [[Brigade 2506]] (Brigada Asalto 2506).<ref name=johnson/> In summer 1960, an airfield (code-named ''JMadd'', aka ''Rayo Base'') was constructed near Retalhuleu, Guatemala. Gunnery and flight training of Brigade 2506 aircrews was carried out by personnel from [[Alabama Air National Guard|Alabama ANG]] (Air National Guard), using at least six Douglas [[B-26 Invader]]s in the markings of FAG ([[Fuerza A<U+00E9>rea Guatemalteca]]), legitimate delivery of those to the FAG being delayed by about six months. An additional 26 B-26s were obtained from US military stocks, 'sanitized' at [[Duke Field|'Field Three']] to obscure their origins, and about 20 of them were converted for offensive operations by removal of defensive armament, standardization of the 'eight-gun nose', addition of underwing drop tanks and rocket racks.<ref>Overall, Mario E. (2003). [http://www.laahs.com/artman/publish/article_50.shtml Bay of Pigs: The Guatemalan Connection]</ref><ref name=hagedorn2006>Hagedorn (2006)</ref> Paratroop training was at a base nicknamed ''Garrapatenango'', near [[Quetzaltenango]], Guatemala. Training for boat handling and amphibious landings took place at [[Vieques]] Island, Puerto Rico. Tank training took place at [[Fort Knox]], Kentucky and [[Fort Benning]], Georgia. Underwater demolition and infiltration training took place at [[Belle Chase]] near New Orleans.<ref name=kornbluh/>

The CIA used [[Douglas C-54]] transports to deliver people, supplies, and arms from Florida at night. [[Curtiss C-46]]s were also used for transport between Retalhuleu and a CIA base (code-named ''JMTide'', aka ''Happy Valley'') at [[Puerto Cabezas]], Nicaragua. On 9 April 1961, Brigade 2506 personnel, ships, and aircraft started transferring from Guatemala to Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua.<ref name=nsa>[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/bayofpigs/chron.html Bay of Pigs, 40 Years After: Chronology]. The National Security Archive. The George Washington University.</ref>

Facilities and limited logistical assistance were provided by the governments of General [[Miguel Yd<U+00ED>goras Fuentes]] in Guatemala, and General [[Luis Somoza Debayle]] in Nicaragua. In return, in 1960 the CIA helped to prevent a military coup in Guatemala, and both governments later received military training and equipment, including some of the remaining CIA B-26s. No military personnel or equipment of those nations were directly employed in the conflict<ref>Hagedorn 1993</ref><ref name=hagedorn2006/>

In early 1961, Cuba's army possessed [[Soviet]]-designed [[T-34]] and [[IS-2]] ''Stalin'' tanks, [[SU-100]] self-propelled 'tank destroyers', 122&nbsp;mm [[howitzer]]s, other artillery and small arms, plus Italian 105&nbsp;mm howitzers. The Cuban air force armed inventory included Douglas [[B-26 Invader]] light bombers, [[Hawker Sea Fury]] fighters, and [[T-33 Shooting Star|Lockheed T-33]] jets, all remaining from the ''Fuerza A<U+00E9>rea del Ej<U+00E9>rcito de Cuba'' (FAEC), the Cuban air force of the [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]] government.<ref name=johnson/>

Anticipating an invasion, [[Che Guevara]] stressed the importance of an armed civilian populace, stating "all the Cuban people must become a [[guerrilla]] army, each and every Cuban must learn to handle and if necessary use firearms in defense of the nation."<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], pp. 54-55.</ref>

==Participants==
===U.S. Government personnel===
Recruiting of Cuban exiles in Miami was organized by CIA staff officers [[E. Howard Hunt]] and [[Gerry Droller]]. Detailed planning, training and military operations were conducted by [[Jacob Esterline]], Colonel [[Jack Hawkins (US Marine Corps officer)|Jack Hawkins]] and Colonel Stanley W. Beerli under the direction of Richard Bissell, and his deputy [[Tracy Barnes]].<ref name=kornbluh/>

===Cuban government personnel===
Already, Fidel Castro was known as, and addressed as, the commander-in-chief of Cuban armed forces, with a nominal base at 'Point One' in Havana. In early April 1961, his brother [[Ra<U+00FA>l Castro]] was assigned command of forces in the east, based in [[Santiago de Cuba]]. Che Guevara commanded western forces, based in [[Pinar del R<U+00ED>o]]. Major [[Juan Almeida Bosque]] commanded forces in the central provinces, based in [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]]. Ra<U+00FA>l Curbelo Morales was head of the air force. [[Sergio del Valle Jim<U+00E9>nez]] was Director of Headquarters Operations at Point One. [[Efigenio Ameijeiras]] was the Head of the Revolutionary National Police. [[Ramiro Vald<U+00E9>s|Ramiro Vald<U+00E9>s Men<U+00E9>ndez]] was Minister of the Interior and head of G-2 (Seguridad del Estado, or state security). His deputy was Comandante [[Manuel Pi<U+00F1>eiro|Manuel Pi<U+00F1>eiro Losada]], also known as 'Barba Roja'. Captain [[Jos<U+00E9> Ram<U+00F3>n Fern<U+00E1>ndez]] was head of the School of Militia Leaders (Cadets) at [[Matanzas]].<ref name=szulc1986/><ref name=rodriguez/>{{rp|169}}<ref name=wyden/><ref name=kellnerp69>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 69.</ref><ref>Alfonso, Pablo. 2001.

Soviet-trained Spanish advisors were brought to Cuba from [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. These advisors had held high staff positions in the Soviet Armies during World War II, and became known as 'Hispano-Soviets', having long-resided in the Soviet Union. The most senior of these were the Spanish Communist veterans of the [[Spanish Civil War]], [[Francisco Ciutat de Miguel]], [[Enrique L<U+00ED>ster]], and Cuban-born [[Alberto Bayo]].<ref>Paz-Sanchez (2001), pp. 189<U+2013>99.</ref> Ciutat de Miguel (Cuban alias: <U+00C1>ngel Mart<U+00ED>nez Riosola, commonly referred to as Angelito) was an advisor to forces in the central provinces. The role of other Soviet agents at the time is uncertain, but some of them acquired greater fame later. For example, two KGB colonels, Vadim Kochergin and Victor Simanov were first sighted in Cuba in about September 1959.<ref>British Foreign Office.

==Prior warnings of invasion==
The Cuban security apparatus knew the invasion was coming, via their secret intelligence network, as well as loose talk by members of the brigade, some of which was heard in Miami, and was repeated in US and foreign newspaper reports. Nevertheless, days before the invasion, multiple acts of sabotage were carried out, such as the [[El Encanto fire]], an arson attack in a department store in Havana on 13 April, that killed one shop worker.<ref name=fernandez/><ref name=rodriguez/>{{rp|123-125}} The Cuban government also had been warned by senior [[KGB]] agents [[Osvaldo S<U+00E1>nchez Cabrera]] and 'Aragon', who died violently before and after the invasion, respectively.<ref>Welch and Blight (1998), p. 113.</ref> The general Cuban population was not well informed, except for CIA-funded [[Pirate radio in Central America and Caribbean Sea|Radio Swan]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.firmaspress.com/viaje-al-corazon-de-cuba.pdf | format = PDF | title = Viaje al Coraz<U+00F3>n de Cuba | language = es | publisher = Plaza & Jan<U+00E9>s | year = 1999 | last = Montaner | first =Carlos Alberto}}</ref> As of May 1960, almost all means of public communication were in the government's hands.<ref>{{cite news | title = The New York Times | date = 1960-05-26 | page = 5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cidh.oas.org/countryrep/Cuba83eng/chap.5.htm | title = The Situation of Human Rights in Cuba, Seventh Report <U+2014> Chapter V | publisher = Organization of American States | date = 1983-10-04 | accessdate = 2004-12-24 | author = Inter-American Commission on Human Rights}}</ref>

On 29 April 2000, a ''[[Washington Post]]'' article, "Soviets Knew Date of Cuba Attack", reported that the CIA had information indicating that the Soviet Union knew the invasion was going to take place, and did not inform Kennedy. On 13 April 1961, [[Voice of Russia|Radio Moscow]] broadcast an English-language newscast, predicting the invasion "in a plot hatched by the CIA" using paid "criminals" within a week. The invasion took place four days later.<ref>Galbraith, J.K. (2000) http://web.archive.org/web/20060904201459re_/utip.gov.utexas.edu/jg/archive/2000/crimesoimmense.pdf</ref>

[[David Ormsby-Gore]], British Ambassador to the US, stated that British intelligence analysis, as made available to the CIA, indicated that the Cuban people were predominantly behind Castro, and that there was no likelihood of mass defections or insurrections.<ref name=schlesinger>Schlesinger (1965)</ref>{{rp|264}}

==Prelude to invasion==
===Air attacks on airfields (15 April)===
During the night of 14/15 April, a diversionary landing was planned near [[Baracoa]], [[Oriente Province]], by about 164 Cuban exiles commanded by Higinio 'Nino' Diaz. Their mother ship, named ''La Playa'' or ''Santa Ana'', had sailed from Key West under a Costa Rican ensign. Several US Navy destroyers were stationed offshore near [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay]] to give the appearance of an impending invasion fleet.<ref>Wyden (1979), p. 172 (footnote <U+2020>)</ref> The reconnaissance boats turned back to the ship after their crews detected activities by Cuban militia forces along the coastline.<ref name=szulc1986/><ref name=rodriguez/>{{rp|156<U+2013>159}}<ref name=johnson>Johnson (1964)</ref><ref name=wyden/><ref name=triay>Triay (2001), pp. 83-113</ref><ref>FRUS X, document 198</ref>

As a result of those activities, at daybreak, a Cuban Air Force reconnaissance sortie over the Baracoa area was launched from Santiago de Cuba. That was a FAR T-33, piloted by Lt Orestes Acosta, and it crashed fatally into the sea. On 17 April, his name was falsely quoted as a defector among the disinformation circulating in Miami.<ref name=ferrer/>

On 15 April 1961, at about 06:00 Cuba local time, eight Douglas [[A-26 Invader|B-26B Invader]] bombers in three groups simultaneously attacked three Cuban airfields at [[San Antonio de los Ba<U+00F1>os]] and at Ciudad Libertad (formerly named Campo Columbia), both near Havana, plus the [[Antonio Maceo Airport|Antonio Maceo International Airport]] at Santiago de Cuba. The B-26s had been prepared by the CIA on behalf of Brigade 2506, and had been painted with the [[false flag]] markings of the FAR ([[Cuban Air Force|Fuerza A<U+00E9>rea Revolucionaria]]), the air force of the Cuban government. Each was armed with bombs, rockets and machine guns. They had flown from Puerto Cabezas in Nicaragua, and were crewed by exiled Cuban pilots and navigators of the self-styled ''Fuerza A<U+00E9>rea de Liberaci<U+00F3>n'' (FAL). The purpose of the action (code-named ''Operation Puma'') was reportedly to destroy most or all of the armed aircraft of the FAR in preparation for the main invasion. At Santiago, the two attackers destroyed a [[C-47]] transport, a [[PBY Catalina]] flying boat, two B-26s and a civilian [[DC-3]] plus various other civilian aircraft. At San Antonio, the three attackers destroyed three FAR B-26s, one Sea Fury and one T-33, and one attacker diverted to [[Cayman Islands|Grand Cayman]] due to low usable fuel. At Ciudad Libertad, the three attackers destroyed only non-operational aircraft such as two [[P-47]] Thunderbolts. One of those attackers was damaged by anti-aircraft fire, and ditched about 50&nbsp;km north of Cuba, with the loss of its crew Daniel Fern<U+00E1>ndez Mon and Gaston P<U+00E9>rez. Its companion B-26, also damaged, continued north and landed at Boca Chica field ([[Naval Air Station Key West]]), Florida. The crew, Jos<U+00E9> Crespo and Lorenzo P<U+00E9>rez-Lorenzo, were granted political asylum, and made their way back to Nicaragua the next day via Miami and the daily CIA C-54 flight from [[Opa-locka Airport]] to Puerto Cabezas. Their B-26, purposely numbered 933, the same as at least two other B-26s that day for disinformation reasons, was held until late on 17 April.<ref name=rodriguez/>{{rp|130}}<ref name=ferrer>Ferrer (1975)</ref>

===Deception flight (15 April)===
About 90 minutes after the eight B-26s had taken off from Puerto Cabezas to attack Cuban airfields, another B-26 departed on a deception flight that took it close to Cuba but headed north towards Florida. Like the bomber groups, it carried false FAR markings and the same number 933 as painted on at least two of the others. Prior to departure, the cowling from one of the aircraft's two engines was removed by CIA personnel, fired upon, then re-installed to give the false appearance that the aircraft had taken ground fire at some point during its flight. At a safe distance north of Cuba, the pilot feathered the engine with the pre-installed bullet holes in the cowling, radioed a [[Mayday (distress signal)|mayday]] call, and requested immediate permission to land at Miami International airport. The pilot was Mario Z<U+00FA><U+00F1>iga, formerly of the FAEC (Cuban Air Force), and after landing he masqueraded as 'Juan Garcia', and publicly claimed that three colleagues had also defected from the FAR. The next day he was granted political asylum, and that night he returned to Puerto Cabezas via Opa-Locka.<ref name=hagedorn2006/><ref name=ferrer/><ref>Szulc, Tad.

===Reactions (15 April)===
At 10:30 am on 15 April at the [[United Nations]], the Cuban Foreign Minister [[Ra<U+00FA>l Roa Garc<U+00ED>a|Ra<U+00FA>l Roa]] attempted to accuse the US of aggressive air attacks against Cuba, and that afternoon formally tabled a motion to the Political (First) Committee of the UN General Assembly. In response, US ambassador to the UN [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] stated that US armed forces would not "under any conditions" intervene in Cuba, and that the US would do everything in its power to ensure that no US citizens would participate in actions against Cuba. He also stated that Cuban defectors had carried out the attacks that day, and he presented a UPI wire photo of Z<U+00FA><U+00F1>iga's B-26 in Cuban markings at Miami airport. Stevenson was later embarrassed to realize that the CIA had lied to him and to Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]].<ref name=faria/><ref name=nsa/><ref name=wyden>Wyden (1979)</ref>

President Kennedy supported the statement made by Stevenson: "I have emphasized before that this was a struggle of Cuban patriots against a Cuban dictator. While we could not be expected to hide our sympathies, we made it repeatedly clear that the armed forces of this country would not intervene in any way."<ref>UPI Radio Archives (JFK) [http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1961/Bay-of-Pigs-Invasion/12295509433760-3/ upi.com]</ref>

On 15 April, the national police, led by [[Efigenio Ameijeiras]], started the process of arresting thousands of suspected anti-revolutionary individuals, and detaining them in provisional locations such as the Karl Marx Theatre, the moat of [[La Caba<U+00F1>a|Fortaleza de la Cabana]] and the Principe Castle all in Havana, and the baseball park in Matanzas.<ref name=thomas/>

===Phony war (16 April)===
On the night of 15/16 April, the Nino Diaz group failed in a second attempted diversionary landing at a fresh location near Baracoa.<ref name=wyden/>

On 16 April, Merardo Leon, Jose Leon, and 14 others staged an armed uprising at Las Delicias Estate in Las Villas, with only four surviving. Leonel Martinez and three others took to the countryside.<ref name=corzo/>{{Clarify|date=September 2009}}

Following the air strikes on airfields on 15 April 1961, the FAR managed to prepare for armed action at least four T-33s, four Sea Furies and five or six B-26s. All three types were armed with machine guns for air-to-air combat and for strafing of ships and ground targets. CIA planners had failed to discover that the US-supplied T-33 jets had long been armed with M-3 machine guns. The three types could also carry bombs, for attacks against ships and tanks.<ref name=macphall>MacPhall, Doug & Acree, Chuck (2003). [http://www.laahs.com/artman/publish/article_38.shtml "Bay of Pigs: The Men and Aircraft of the Cuban Revolutionary Air Force"].</ref>

No additional air strikes against Cuban airfields and aircraft were specifically planned before 17 April, because B-26 pilots' exaggerated claims gave the CIA false confidence in the success of the 15 April attacks, until [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] reconnaissance photos on 16 April showed otherwise. Late on 16 April, President Kennedy ordered cancellation of further airfield strikes planned for dawn on 17 April, to attempt plausible deniability of US direct involvement.<ref name=kornbluh/>

Late on 16 April, the CIA/Brigade 2506 invasion fleet converged on 'Rendezvous Point Zulu', about {{convert|65|km|mi}} south of Cuba, having sailed from [[Puerto Cabezas]] in Nicaragua where they had been loaded with troops and other [[materiel]], after loading arms and supplies at New Orleans. The US Navy operation was code-named ''Bumpy Road'', having been changed from ''Crosspatch'' on 1 April 1961.<ref name=kornbluh/> The fleet, labelled the 'Cuban Expeditionary Force' (CEF), included five 2,400-ton (empty weight) freighter ships chartered by the CIA from the Garcia Line, and subsequently outfitted with anti-aircraft guns. Four of the freighters, ''Houston'' (code name ''Aguja''), ''R<U+00ED>o Escondido'' (code name ''Ballena''), ''Caribe'' (code name ''Sardina''), and ''Atl<U+00E1>ntico'' (code-name ''Tibur<U+00F3>n''), were planned to transport about 1,400 troops in seven battalions of troops and armaments near to the invasion beaches. The fifth freighter, ''Lake Charles'', was loaded with follow-up supplies and some [[Operation 40]] infiltration personnel. The freighters sailed under Liberian ensigns. Accompanying them were two LCIs ([[Landing Craft Infantry]]) 'purchased' from [[Zapata Corporation]] then outfitted with heavy armament at Key West, then exercises and training at Vieques Island. The LCIs were ''Blagar'' (code-name ''Marsopa'') and ''Barbara J'' (code-name ''Barracuda''), sailing under Nicaraguan ensigns. The CEF ships were individually escorted (outside visual range) to ''Point Zulu'' by US Navy destroyers {{USS|Bache|DD-470|6}}, {{USS|Beale|DD-471|6}}, {{USS|Conway|DD-507|6}}, {{USS|Cony|DDE-508|6}}, {{USS|Eaton|DD-510|6}}, {{USS|Murray|DD-576|6}}, {{USS|Waller|DDE-466|6}}. US Navy Task Group 81.8 had already assembled off the Cayman Islands, commanded by Rear Admiral John E.

Command and control ship {{USS|Northampton|CLC-1|6}} and carrier {{USS|Shangri-La|CVA-38|6}} were also reportedly active in the Caribbean at the time. {{USS|San Marcos|LSD-25|6}} was a [[Landing Ship Dock]] that carried three LCUs ([[Landing Craft Utility]]) and four [[LCVP]]s (Landing Craft, Vehicles, Personnel). ''San Marcos'' had sailed from Vieques Island. At ''Point Zulu'', the seven CEF ships sailed north without the USN escorts, except for ''San Marcos'' that continued until the seven landing craft were unloaded when just outside the {{convert|5|km|mi|0}} Cuban territorial limit.<ref name=nsa/><ref name=fernandez/><ref>FRUS X, document 87</ref>

===Invasion day (17 April)===
During the night of 16/17 April, a mock diversionary landing was organized by CIA operatives near [[Bah<U+00ED>a Honda, Cuba|Bah<U+00ED>a Honda]], [[Pinar del R<U+00ED>o Province]]. A flotilla of small boats towed rafts containing equipment that broadcasted sounds and other effects of a shipborne invasion landing. That was the source of Cuban reports that briefly lured Fidel Castro away from the Bay of Pigs battlefront area.<ref name=fernandez/><ref name=rodriguez/>{{rp|183}}<ref name=wyden/>

At about 00:00 on 17 April 1961, the two CIA LCIs ''Blagar'' and ''Barbara J'', each with a CIA 'operations officer' and an Underwater Demolition Team (UDT) of five frogmen, entered the Bay of Pigs ''(Bah<U+00ED>a de Cochinos)'' on the southern coast of Cuba. They headed a force of four transport ships (''Houston'', ''R<U+00ED>o Escondido'', ''Caribe'' and ''Atl<U+00E1>ntico'') carrying about 1,400 Cuban exile ground troops of Brigade 2506, plus tanks and other vehicles in the landing craft. At about 01:00, the ''Blagar'', as the battlefield command ship, directed the principal landing at Playa Gir<U+00F3>n (code-named ''Blue Beach''), led by the frogmen in rubber boats followed by troops from ''Caribe'' in small aluminium boats, then LCVPs and LCUs. The ''Barbara J'', leading ''Houston'', similarly landed troops 35&nbsp;km further northwest at Playa Larga (code-named ''Red Beach''), using small fiberglass boats. Unloading troops at night was delayed, due to engine failures and boats damaged by unseen coral reefs. The few militia in the area succeeded in warning Cuban armed forces via radio soon after the first landing, before the invaders overcame their token resistance.<ref name=rodriguez/>{{rp|161,167}}<ref name=wyden/>

At daybreak at about 06:30, three FAR Sea Furies, one B-26 and two T-33 jets started attacking those CEF ships still unloading troops. At about 06:50, and {{convert|8|km|mi}} south of Playa Larga, ''Houston'' was damaged by several rockets from a Sea Fury and a T-33, and about 2 hours later captain Luis Morse intentionally beached it on the western side of the bay. About 270 troops had been unloaded, but about 180 survivors who struggled ashore were incapable of taking part in further action because of the loss of most of their weapons and equipment. At about 07:00, two invading FAL B-26s attacked and sank the Cuban Navy Patrol Escort ship ''El Baire'' at [[Nueva Gerona]] on the [[Isla de la Juventud|Isle of Pines]].<ref name=wyden/><ref name=ferrer/> They then proceeded to Gir<U+00F3>n to join two other B-26s to attack Cuban ground troops and provide distraction air cover for the paratroop C-46s and the CEF ships under air attack.

At about 07:30, five C-46 and one C-54 transport aircraft dropped 177 paratroops from the parachute battalion of Brigade 2506 in an action code-named ''Operation Falcon''.<ref name=cooper>Cooper, Tom (2003) [http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_154.shtml "Clandestine US Operations: Cuba, 1961, Bay of Pigs"]</ref> About 30 men, plus heavy equipment, were dropped south of Australia sugar mill on the road to Palpite and Playa Larga, but the equipment was lost in the swamps, and the troops failed to block the road. Other troops were dropped at [[San Blas, Cuba|San Blas]], at Jocuma between Covadonga and San Blas, and at Horquitas between Yaguaramas and San Blas. Those positions to block the roads were maintained for two days, reinforced by ground troops from Playa Gir<U+00F3>n.<ref name=rodriguez/>{{rp|206}}

At about 08:30, a FAR Sea Fury piloted by Carlos Ulloa Arauz crashed in the bay, due to stalling or anti-aircraft fire, after encountering a FAL C-46 returning south after dropping paratroops. By 09:00, Cuban troops and militia from outside the area had started arriving at Australia sugar mill, Covadonga and Yaguaramas. Throughout the day they were reinforced by more troops, heavy armour and [[T-34]] tanks typically carried on flat-bed trucks.<ref name=rodriguez/>{{rp|195-196}} At about 09:30, FAR Sea Furies and T-33s fired rockets at the ''Rio Escondido'', that 'blew up' and sank about {{convert|3|km|mi}} south of Gir<U+00F3>n.<ref name=johnson/><ref name=wyden/>

At about 11:00, Premier Fidel Castro issued a statement over Cuba's nationwide network saying that the invaders, members of the exiled Cuban revolutionary front, have come to destroy the revolution and take away the dignity and rights of men.<ref>UPI Radio Archives (Castro) [http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1961/Bay-of-Pigs-Invasion/12295509433760-3/ upi.com]</ref>

At about 11:00, a FAR T-33 attacked a FAL B-26 (serial number 935) piloted by Matias Farias who then survived a crashlanding on the Gir<U+00F3>n airfield, his navigator Eduardo Gonz<U+00E1>lez already killed by gunfire. His companion B-26 suffered damage and diverted to Grand Cayman Island; pilot Mario Z<U+00FA><U+00F1>iga (the 'defector') and navigator Oscar Vega returned to Puerto Cabezas via CIA C-54 on 18 April. By about 11:00, the two remaining freighters ''Caribe'' and ''Atl<U+00E1>ntico'', and the CIA LCIs and LCUs, started retreating south to international waters, but still pursued by FAR aircraft. At about 12:00, a FAR B-26 exploded due to heavy anti-aircraft fire from ''Blagar'', and pilot Luis Silva Tablada (on his second sortie) and his crew of three were lost.<ref name=hagedorn2006/><ref name=wyden/>

By 12:00, hundreds of militia cadets from Matanzas had secured Palpite, and cautiously advanced on foot south towards Playa Larga, suffering many casualties during attacks by FAL B-26s. By dusk, other Cuban ground forces were gradually advancing southward from Covadonga and southwest from Yaguaramas toward San Blas, and westward along coastal tracks from Cienfuegos towards Gir<U+00F3>n, all without heavy weapons or armour.<ref name=wyden/>

Three FAL B-26s were shot down by FAR T-33s, with the loss of pilots Ra<U+00FA>l Vianello, Jos<U+00E9> Crespo, Osvaldo Piedra and navigators Lorenzo P<U+00E9>rez-Lorenzo and Jos<U+00E9> Fern<U+00E1>ndez. Vianello's navigator Demetrio P<U+00E9>rez bailed out and was picked up by USS ''Murray''. Pilot Crisp<U+00ED>n Garc<U+00ED>a Fern<U+00E1>ndez and navigator Juan Gonz<U+00E1>lez Romero, in B-26 serial 940, diverted to Boca Chica, but late that night they attempted to fly back to Puerto Cabezas in B-26 serial 933 that Crespo had flown to Boca Chica on 15 April. In October 1961, the remains of the B-26 and its two crew were found in dense jungle in Nicaragua.<ref name=ferrer/><ref name=pfeiffer_v1_pt2>Pfeiffer (1979), Vol.I, Part 2</ref>{{rp|313-317}} One FAL B-26 diverted to Grand Cayman with engine failure.

On 17 April 1961, Osvaldo Ram<U+00ED>rez (leader of the [[War Against the Bandits|rural resistance to Castro]]) was captured in Aromas de Vel<U+00E1>zquez, and immediately executed.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web | title = Nuevo Acci<U+00F3>n | language = es | url = http://www.nuevoaccion.com/}}</ref> The CIA was unaware or unconcerned at such repression's effects on the planned operation.<ref name=nsa/>

At about 21:00 on 17 April 1961, a night air strike by three FAL B-26s on San Antonio de Los Ba<U+00F1>os airfield failed, reportedly due to incompetence and bad weather. Two other B-26s had aborted the mission after take-off.<ref name=hagedorn2006/><ref name=macphall/> Other sources allege that heavy anti-aircraft fire scared the aircrews, the resultant smoke perhaps a convenient excuse for "poor visibility".<ref name=rodriguez/>{{rp|138}}

===Invasion day plus one (D+1) 18 April===
By about 10:30 on 18 April, Cuban troops and militia, supported by tanks, took Playa Larga after Brigade forces had fled towards Gir<U+00F3>n in the early hours. During the day, Brigade forces retreated to San Blas along the two roads from Covadonga and Yaguaramas. By then, both Fidel Castro and Jos<U+00E9> Ram<U+00F3>n Fern<U+00E1>ndez had re-located to that battlefront area.<ref name=rodriguez/>{{rp|207}}

At about 17:00 on 18 April, FAL B-26s attacked a Cuban column of 12 civilian buses leading trucks carrying tanks and other armour, moving southeast between Playa Larga and Punta Perdiz. The vehicles, loaded with civilians, militia, police and soldiers, were attacked with bombs, [[napalm]] and rockets, suffering heavy casualties. The six B-26s were piloted by two CIA contract pilots plus four pilots and six navigators from Brigade 2506 air force.<ref name=wyden/><ref name=ferrer/> The column later re-formed and advanced to Punta Perdiz, about 11&nbsp;km northwest of Gir<U+00F3>n.<ref name=rodriguez/>{{rp|197}}

===Invasion day plus two (D+2) 19 April===
During the night of 18 April, a FAL C-46 delivered arms and equipment to the Gir<U+00F3>n airstrip occupied by Brigade 2506 ground forces, and took off before daybreak on 19 April.<ref name=frusx110>FRUS X, document 110</ref> The C-46 also evacuated Matias Farias, the pilot of B-26 serial '935' (code-named ''Chico Two'') that had been shot down and crash-landed at Gir<U+00F3>n on 17 April.<ref name=cooper/>

The final air attack mission (code-named ''Mad Dog Flight'') comprised five B-26s, four of which were manned by American CIA contract air crews and pilots from the Alabama Air Guard. One FAR Sea Fury (piloted by Douglas Rudd) and two FAR T-33s (piloted by Rafael del Pino and Alvaro Prendes) shot down two of these B-26s, killing four American airmen.<ref name=nsa/>

Combat air patrols were flown by Douglas [[A4D|A4D-2N]] Skyhawk jets of [[VFA-34|VA-34]] squadron operating from USS ''Essex'', with nationality and other markings removed. Sorties were flown to reassure Brigade soldiers and pilots, and to intimidate Cuban government forces without directly engaging in acts of war.<ref name=ferrer/>

Without direct air support, and short of ammunition, Brigade 2506 ground forces retreated to the beaches in the face of considerable onslaught from Cuban government artillery, tanks and infantry.<ref name=johnson/><ref>De Paz-S<U+00E1>nchez (2001)</ref><ref>Viv<U+00E9>s (1984)</ref>

Late on 19 April, destroyers USS ''Eaton'' (code-named ''Santiago'') and USS ''Murray'' (code-named ''Tampico'') moved into Cochinos Bay to evacuate retreating Brigade soldiers from beaches, before firing from Cuban army tanks caused Commodore Crutchfield to order a withdrawal.<ref name=wyden/>

===Invasion day plus three (D+3) 20 April===
From 19 April until about 22 April, sorties were flown by A4D-2Ns to obtain visual intelligence over combat areas. Reconnaissance flights are also reported of Douglas [[A-1 Skyraider|AD-5W]]s of VFP-62 and/or VAW-12 squadron from USS ''Essex'' or another carrier, such as USS ''Shangri-La'' that was part of the task force assembled off the Cayman Islands.<ref name=wyden/><ref name=ferrer/>

On 21 April, ''Eaton'' and ''Murray'', joined on 22 April by destroyers USS ''Conway'' and USS ''Cony'', plus submarine USS ''Threadfin'' and a CIA [[PBY Catalina|PBY-5A Catalina]] flying boat, continued to search the coastline, reefs and islands for scattered Brigade survivors, about 24-30 being rescued.<ref name=frusx110/>

On 19 April 1961, at least seven Cubans plus two CIA-hired US citizens (Angus K. McNair and Howard F. Anderson) were executed in Pinar del Rio province, after a two-day trial. On 20 April, [[Humberto Sor<U+00ED> Marin]] was executed at [[La Caba<U+00F1>a|Fortaleza de la Caba<U+00F1>a]], having been arrested on 18 March following infiltration into Cuba with 14 tons of explosives.

About 1,202 Brigade 2506 members were captured, of which nine died from asphyxiation during transfer to Havana in a closed truck.

===Political reaction===
[[Image:Robert F. Kennedy Statement on Cuba and Neutrality Laws April 20, 1961.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s Statement on Cuba and Neutrality Laws, 20 April 1961]]
The failed invasion severely embarrassed the Kennedy Administration, and made Castro wary of future US intervention in Cuba. On 21 April, in a State Department press conference, President Kennedy said: "There's an old saying that victory has a hundred fathers and defeat is an orphan... What matters is only one fact, I am the responsible officer of the government."<ref name=schlesinger/>{{rp|262}}

In August 1961, during an economic conference of the [[Organization of American States]] in [[Punta del Este]], Uruguay, Che Guevara sent a note to Kennedy via [[Richard N. Goodwin]], a secretary of the [[White House]]. It said: "Thanks for Playa Gir<U+00F3>n. Before the invasion, the revolution was weak. Now it's stronger than ever."<ref>Anderson (1997), p. 509</ref>

Additionally, Guevara answered a set of questions from [[Leo Huberman]] of ''[[Monthly Review]]'' following the invasion. In one reply, Guevara was asked to explain the growing number of Cuban [[counter-revolutionaries]] and defectors from the regime, to which he replied that the repelled invasion was the climax of counter revolution, and that afterwards such actions "fell drastically to zero." In regards to the defections of some prominent figures within the Cuban government, Guevara remarked that this was because "the socialist revolution left the opportunists, the ambitious, and the fearful far behind and now advances toward a new regime free of this class of vermin."<ref>[http://www.monthlyreview.org/961che.htm Huberman. Cuba and the U.S.] interview with Che Guevara, ''[[Monthly Review]]'', September 1961</ref>

As Allen Dulles later stated, CIA planners believed that once the troops were on the ground, any action required for success would be authorized to prevent failure, as Eisenhower had done in Guatemala in 1954 after the invasion looked as if it was collapsing.<ref>Reeves, Richard (1993), pp. 71, 673.</ref> President Kennedy was angered with the CIA's failure, and declared he wanted "to splinter the CIA in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds."<ref>"CIA: Maker of Policy, or Tool?" ''New York Times''. 25 April 1966</ref> Kennedy commented to his journalist friend [[Benjamin C. Bradlee|Ben Bradlee]], "The first advice I'm going to give my successor is to watch the generals and to avoid feeling that because they were military men their opinions on military matters were worth a damn."<ref>Dallek (2003) ''[[An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917-1963]]'', p. 368</ref>

==Later analysis==
===Maxwell Taylor survey===
On 22 April 1961, President Kennedy asked General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]], Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]], Admiral [[Arleigh Burke]] and CIA Director Allen Dulles to form the Cuba Study Group, to report on the lessons to be learned from
the failed operation. On 13 June, General Taylor submitted the report of
the Board of Inquiry to President Kennedy. The defeat was attributed to lack of
early realization of the impossibility of success by covert means, inadequate aircraft,
limitations of armaments, pilots and air attacks to attempt plausible deniability,
and ultimately, loss of important ships and lack of ammunition.<ref name=kornbluh/>{{rp|324}}

===CIA report===
In November 1961, CIA inspector general [[Lyman Kirkpatrick|Lyman B Kirkpatrick]],
authored a report 'Survey of the Cuban Operation', that remained classified
top secret until 1996. Conclusions were:<ref name=kornbluh/>{{rp|99}}
# The CIA exceeded its capabilities in developing the project from guerrilla support to overt armed action without any plausible deniability.
# Failure to realistically assess risks and to adequately communicate information and decisions internally and with other government principals.
# Insufficient involvement of leaders of the exiles.
# Failure to sufficiently organize internal resistance in Cuba.
# Failure to competently collect and analyze intelligence about Cuban forces.
# Poor internal management of communications and staff.
# Insufficient employment of high-quality staff.
# Insufficient Spanish-speakers, training facilities and material resources.
# Lack of stable policies and/or contingency plans.

In spite of vigorous rebuttals by CIA management of the findings, CIA Director Allen Dulles, [[Deputy Director of Central Intelligence|CIA Deputy Director]] [[Charles Cabell]], and Deputy Director for Plans Richard Bissell were all forced to resign by early 1962.<ref name=higgins/>

In later years, the CIA's behavior in the event became the prime example cited for the psychology paradigm known as [[groupthink]] syndrome.<ref name=wyden/>

In mid-1960, CIA operative [[E. Howard Hunt]] had interviewed Cubans in Havana; in a 1997 interview with [[CNN]], he said, "<U+2026>all I could find was a lot of enthusiasm for Fidel Castro."<ref>{{cite web

===Invasion legacy in Cuba===
The invasion is often recognized as making Castro even more popular, adding nationalistic sentiments to the support for his economic policies. Following the 15 April air attacks on Cuban airfields, he declared the revolution "[[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]]".<ref name=kellnerp69/> After the invasion, he pursued closer relations with the Soviet Union, partly for protection, that helped pave the way for the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. Castro was then increasingly wary of further US intervention, and more open to Soviet suggestions of placing nuclear weapons on Cuba to ensure its security.

[[File:LittleHavanOct06BayOfPigsMonument.jpg|150px|thumb|Bay of Pigs Memorial in [[Little Havana]]- [[Miami]], [[Florida]].]]
In March 2001, shortly before the 40th anniversary of the invasion, a conference took place in Havana, attended by about 60 American delegates. The conference was titled [[Bay of Pigs: 40 Years After]], co-sponsored by the [[University of Havana]] and the US-based [[National Security Archive]].<ref>NSA press release, 23 March 2001 [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/bayofpigs/agenda.html Bay of Pigs: 40 Years After]</ref>

There are still yearly nationwide drills in Cuba during the 'Dia de la Defensa' (Defense Day), to prepare the population for an invasion.

===Invasion legacy for Cuban exiles===
Many who fought for the CIA in the conflict remained loyal after the event; some Bay of Pigs veterans became officers in the US Army in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], including six colonels, 19 lieutenant colonels, nine majors, and 29 captains.<ref>Ros, Enrique (1994), pp. 287<U+2013>98.</ref> By March 2007, about half of the Brigade had died.<ref>{{cite news | last = Iuspa-Abbott | first = Paola | accessdate = 2007-03-27 | title = Palm Beach County Bay of Pigs veterans remember invasion of Cuba | work = South Florida Sun-Sentinel | url = http://archives.econ.utah.edu/archives/cubanews/2007w13/msg00006.htm}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

[[Image:Giron.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Hawker Sea Fury]] displayed at Museo Gir<U+00F3>n.]]

Little remains of the original village, which in the 1960s was small and remote. It is still remote, with just a single road to the village and out again, but it has grown markedly since the invasion. Few people there today were residents at the time. The road from the north is marked by frequent memorials to the Cuban dead. There are billboards marking where invaders were rounded up and showing pictures of their being led away. Another at the entrance to the village quotes Fidel Castro's comment that the conflict was the "first defeat of Yankee imperialism." A two-room museum, with aircraft and other military equipment outside, shows pictures, arms and maps of the attack and photos of Cuban soldiers who died. Billboards and other material also remember the US-financed [[mercenaries]].
