==Background==

In 2000, an Italian researcher, [[Sergio Messina]], identified <U+201C>[[amateur pornography|realcore pornography]],<U+201D> a new genre consisting of images and videos of ex-girlfriends distributed through [[Usenet]] groups.<ref name=history>Alexa Tsoulis-Reay, [http://nymag.com/news/features/sex/revenge-porn-2013-7 "A Brief History of Revenge Porn"], ''New York Magazine'' (July 21, 2013).</ref> Eight years later, amateur porn aggregator XTube began receiving complaints that pornographic content had been posted without subjects<U+2019> consent.<ref name=history /> Several sites began staging consensual pornography to resemble revenge and hosting "authentic" user-submitted content.<ref name=history />

Revenge porn began garnering international media attention when [[Hunter Moore]] launched [[IsAnyoneUp| IsAnyoneUp.com]] in 2010.<ref name=frontier>On The Media, [http://www.onthemedia.org/story/173718-revenge-porns-latest-frontier/transcript Revenge Porn<U+2019>s Latest Frontier], WNYC (Dec. 2, 2011).</ref> The site featured user-submitted pornography,<ref name=frontier /> and was one of the first sites that included identifying information, such the subjects<U+2019> names, employers, addresses and links to social networking profiles.<ref name=frontier />

==Litigation and legislation ==
Tort, privacy, copyright and state criminal laws offer legal avenues for the removal of non-consensual pornography,<ref>Woodrow Hartzog,[http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2013/05/how-fight-revenge-porn How to Fight Revenge Porn], Stanford Law Center for Internet and Society (May 10, 2013).</ref><ref>Doug Barry, [http://jezebel.com/5993942/a-new-bill-in-florida-would-make-non+consensual-revenge-porn-a-felony A New Bill in Florida Would Make Non-Consensual <U+2018>Revenge Porn<U+2019> a Felony], Jezebel (Apr. 7, 2013).</ref> and many individuals whose sexually explicit photographs were posted online without their consent have sought legal remedies.<ref>Emily Bazelon,[http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/01/23/women_sue_to_fight_back_against_revenge_porn.html Fighting Back Against Revenge Porn], Slate (Jan. 23, 2013).</ref>

Several well-known revenge porn websites, including IsAnyoneUp and the Texxxan, have been taken down in response to actual or threatened legal action.<ref>Erica Goode, [http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/us/victims-push-laws-to-end-online-revenge-posts.html?pagewanted=all Victims Push Laws to End Online Revenge Posts], ''New York Times''(Sep. 23, 2013).</ref>

===Tort and privacy law===

Recent lawsuits over revenge porn have alleged [[invasion of privacy]], [[privacy laws|public disclosure of private fact]] and [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]] against the individuals who uploaded the images.<ref>[http://www.scribd.com/doc/138909420/Revenge-Porn-Complaint-Holly-Jacobs-vs-Ryan-Seay Complaint in ''Jacobs v. Seay''], 13-1362 6CA0 (Fl. Apr. 18, 2013)</ref> Forty states, including California and New York, have [[computer crime|anti-cyberharassment]] laws that may be applicable to cases of revenge porn.<ref>[http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/telecom/cyberstalking-and-cyberharassment-laws.aspx State Cyberstalking and Cyberharassment Laws], National Conference of State Legislatures (Nov. 16, 2012).</ref>

===Copyright===

An estimated 80% of revenge porn victims took the photographs or videos themselves.<ref name="kelly">Heather Kelly, [http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/03/tech/web/revenge-porn-law-california/ New California 'Revenge Porn' Law May Miss Some Vicitms], CNN (Oct. 3, 2013).</ref> Those individuals can bring actions for [[copyright infringement]] against the person who uploaded their nude or semi-nude "[[selfie]]s" and file [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] takedown notices with service providers.<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102 17 U.S.C. <U+00A7>102-Subject Matter of Copyright: In General].</ref>

===Legislation===

In the United States, to date, only two states have laws expressly applicable to revenge porn: New Jersey and California.<ref>Julia Dahl, [http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-57605761-504083/revenge-porn-law-in-california-a-good-first-step-but-flawed-experts-say/ <U+201C>Revenge porn<U+201D> Law in California a Good First Step, But Flawed, Experts Say], CBS News (Oct. 3, 2013).</ref> New York, Wisconsin and Florida are considering legislation that specifically targets revenge porn.<ref name="kelly" />

New Jersey<U+2019>s law prohibits the distribution of "sexually explicit" photographs and films by any person, <U+201C>knowing that he is not licensed or privileged to do so<U+201D> and without the subjects<U+2019> consent.<ref>New Jersey Invasion of Privacy[ftp://www.njleg.state.nj.us/20022003/AL03/206_.PDF N.J.S.A. 2C:14-9].</ref> The law was used to prosecute [[Dharun Ravi]], the Rutgers student who distributed [[Suicide of Tyler Clementi|webcam footage of his roommate]] engaging in sexual activity.<ref>Megan DiMarco and Alexi Friedman,[http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/dharun_ravi_sentenced_for_bias.html Live Blog: Dharun Ravi Sentenced to 30 Days in Jail], The Star-Ledger (May 12, 2012).</ref> The law has also been used to prosecute several men who allegedly distributed revenge porn of their ex-girlfriends.<ref>Marueen O<U+2019>Connor,[http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/08/crusading-sisterhood-of-revenge-porn-victims.html The Crusading Sisterhood of Revenge-Porn Victims], ''New York Magazine'' (Aug. 29, 2013).</ref>

California's law, passed in October 2013, prohibits the distribution of <U+201C>intimate<U+201D> photographs or films taken of a victim <U+201C>with the intent to cause serious emotional distress.<U+201D><ref name=cali>[http://legiscan.com/CA/text/SB255/2013 California SB 255].</ref> The law protects images that were taken consensually, but only if the distributor of the image is also the photographer.<ref name=cali />

[[Hunter Moore]], founder of the now-defunct [[IsAnyoneUp]] revenge porn site, criticized the California legislation in a YouTube statement, because the law <U+201C>doesn<U+2019>t protect selfies, which is the whole point of... revenge porn.<U+201D><ref>Melody Gutierrez, [http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/Law-offers-hope-to-victims-of-revenge-porn-4872856.php Law offers hope to victims of revenge porn], SFGate (Oct. 5, 2013).</ref> Revenge porn victim-advocates, including [[Cyber Civil Rights Initiative]] founder Dr. Holly Jacobs and law professor Mary Anne Franks, have also criticized California law for not being more protective.<ref name="kelly" />

==Legal Protections for revenge porn==

===First Amendment and anti-SLAPP===

Some [[free speech]] advocates object to revenge porn laws on [[First Amendment]] grounds.<ref>Erin Fuchs, [http://www.businessinsider.com/is-revenge-porn-protected-by-the-first-amendment-2013-9 Here<U+2019>s What the Constitution Says About Posting Naked Pictures Of Your Ex To The Internet], Business Insider (Oct. 1, 2013).</ref> The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] has defended revenge porn as constitutionally protected speech as long as the images do not run afoul of criminal laws, such as [[child pornography]] and [[stalking]] laws.<ref>[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/13-14/bill/sen/sb_0251-0300/sb_255_cfa_20130703_114233_sen_floor.html Arguments in Opposition of California's SB 225], (July 3, 2013).</ref> United States courts are generally reluctant to uphold legislation that restricts free speech.<ref>''See'' [http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2853347803518998660&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr ''United States v. Alvarez''], 132 S.Ct. 2537, 2544 (US 2012) ("[A]s a general matter, the First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.").</ref>

Revenge porn uploaders and websites may also use states<U+2019> [[anti-SLAPP]] laws to challenge lawsuits.<ref>Joe Mullin, [http://staging.arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/01/new-lawsuit-against-revenge-porn-site-also-targets-godaddy/ New lawsuit against <U+201C>revenge porn<U+201D> site also targets GoDaddy], Ars Technica (Jan. 22, 2013).</ref> Anti-SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) laws allow defendants to counter lawsuits that are aimed at stifling lawful free speech.<ref>Twenty-five states currently have anti-SLAPP legislation.

===Communications Decency Act <U+00A7>230===

Several recent revenge porn lawsuits have named service providers and websites as defendants alongside individuals who uploaded the images.<ref>[http://www.scribd.com/doc/121463764/Class-Action-Suit-Against-GoDaddy-com-Texxxan-com  ''Toups v. Godaddy.com''], No. D130018-C (Tex.
