The '''Languages of Arda''' are [[artificial language]]s invented by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and used in his books about [[Arda]], including ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. They are important as an inspiration for his imaginary world and as a method for giving a realistic [[linguistics|linguistic]] depth to names and special words that is generally lacking in [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] stories.

In discussing the languages Tolkien invented, it is necessary to consider two aspects: their "primary world" history, namely their literal development by Tolkien as a [[philologist]], and their "secondary world" history, namely their imagined historical development in the history of Middle-earth.

==Primary-world history==
Tolkien was a professional philologist and a specialist in the [[Old English language]]. He was also interested in many languages outside his field and developed a particular love for the [[Finnish language]] (he described the finding of a Finnish grammar book as "entering a complete wine-cellar filled with bottles of an amazing wine of a kind and flavour never tasted before", ''[[The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien]]'', number 214).

Finnish morphology (particularly its rich system of [[inflection]]) in part gave rise to [[Quenya]]. Another of Tolkien's favourites was [[Welsh language|Welsh]] <U+2014> and features of Welsh phonology found their way to [[Sindarin]]. Numerous words were borrowed from existing languages, but less and less obviously as Tolkien progressed, so that attempts to match a source to a particular Elvish word or name in works published during his lifetime are often very dubious.

Language-making was Tolkien's hobby for most of his life. He is known to have constructed his first languages (Animalic and Nevbosh) at a little over thirteen and he continued to ponder upon his creations up until his death more than sixty-five years later. Language invention had always been tightly connected to the mythology that Tolkien developed, as he found that a language could not be complete without the history of the people who spoke it, just as these people could never be fully realistic if imagined only through the [[English language|English]] and as speaking English. Tolkien therefore took the stance of a translator and adaptor rather than that of the original author of his works.

Although the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elvish]] languages [[Sindarin]] and [[Quenya]] are the most famous and the most mature languages of those that Tolkien invented for his mythology, they are by no means the only ones. They belong to a family of Elvish dialects, that originate in [[Common Eldarin]], the language common to all [[Eldar]], which in turn originates in [[Primitive Quendian]], the common root of Eldarin and [[Avari]]n languages. In addition to that, there is a separate language family that is spoken by Men, the most prominent member of which was [[Westron]] (derived from the [[N<U+00FA>men<U+00F3>rean]] speech [[Ad<U+00FB>naic]]) or the "Common speech" of the peoples of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Most Mannish tongues showed influences by Elvish, as well as some [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarvish]] influences. Several independent languages were drafted as well, for example the [[Khuzdul]] language of the Dwarves. Other languages are [[Valarin]] (the tongue of the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]]), and the [[Black Speech]] created by [[Sauron]] during the Second Age. 

===Elvish scholarship===

Although the study of Tolkien's languages is as a rule not taken seriously by mainstream linguistics, a number of serious scholars have worked on compiling all that can be recovered about their histories and grammars.

An early book dedicated to Eldarin is ''An Introduction to Elvish'' by Jim Allan (published by Bran's Head Books), written before the publication of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' in [[1977]] and therefore mostly outdated.

There are several journals dedicated to the subject:
*[[Parma Eldalamberon]], [[Vinyar Tengwar]] and [[Tengwesti<U+00EB>]] are published by the [[Elvish Linguistic Fellowship]]. 
*[[Tyalie Tyelellieva]] is published by Lisa Star. 
*[[Quettar]], Bulletin of the Linguistic Fellowship of The Tolkien Society, edited by Julian C. Bradfield.

[[Tolklang]], [[Elfling]] and [[Lambengolmor]] are mailing lists dedicated to Tolkien linguistics.

==Secondary-world history==
{{sectstub}}

''See also [[Lhammas]], [[Elvish language]]''.

In the history of Middle-earth, the tongues of the Elves are separated as part of the speakers emigrate to [[Aman]] while others stay behind, leading to a split of [[Quenya]] (High-Elvish, or Elf-Latin) and [[Sindarin]].

===Middle-earth linguistics===
Therefore it may be noted that such tongues in turn may have contrasted due to dislike among the elven kindreds. For example, the leader of Sindar Grey Elves (Elw<U+00EB> Singollo) had an ardent hatred of the house of F<U+00EB>anor due to their many deeds, and would not permit their tongue to be spoken in his domain. One may deduce from this that Sindarin may well have changed further over the years due to this.
The invention of writing is attributed to [[R<U+00FA>mil]], who first invented an alphabet: the [[Sarati]] (literally "letters"). [[F<U+00EB>anor]] later enhanced and further developed this alphabet into the [[Tengwar]], which were spread to Middle-earth by the [[Noldor]] and remained in use ever after.<br>
[[Daeron]] of [[Doriath]] independently of R<U+00FA>mil and F<U+00EB>anor had invented the [[Cirth]] runes, but these were only used for inscriptions, and otherwise replaced by the Tengwar, except among the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]].

An important source of Middle-earth linguistic scholarship is [[Pengolodh]] of Gondolin who wrote in Quenya. He is the author of ''[[The War of the Jewels|Quendi and Eldar]]'', the ''[[Lhammas]]'' and ''[[Osanwe-kenta]]''.

In Quenya, ''lamb<U+00EB>'' is the term for spoken language or verbal communication while ''tengwesta'' is a more abstract term for a system or a code of signs and may be translated as "grammar"....

== Writing and spelling ==

Sindarin and Quenya are often written in the ''[[tengwar]]'' script, which Tolkien especially devised for them, or alternatively in the  [[rune]]-like ''[[cirth]]''. When Middle-earth languages are written with the [[Latin alphabet]], either [[acute accent]]s (<U+00E1>, <U+00E9>, <U+00ED>, <U+00F3>, <U+00FA>) or [[circumflex]] accents (<U+00E2>, <U+00EA>, <U+00EE>, <U+00F4>, <U+00FB>, <U+0177>) mark long vowels depending on language or other convention. The [[diaeresis]] (<U+00E4>, <U+00EB>, <U+00F6>) is normally used to mark that a short vowel is to be separately pronounced, that it is not silent or part of a [[diphthong]]. For example, the last four letters of ''Ainulindal<U+00EB>'' should be sounded as if spelled ''dah-leh'' in English rather than as ''dale'' and the first three letters of ''E<U+00E4>rendil'' represent something like ''eh-ahr'' rather than the English word ''ear''. (But occasionally, especially when writing proto-Eldarin forms, Tolkien used the [[macron]] to indicate long vowels and the dieresis on <U+00E4>, <U+00F6>, and <U+00FC> as in German to indicate ''i''-modification or ''e''-modification.)

In the ''Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien adopted the literary device of claiming to have replaced the original [[Westron]] with English. This device of rendering an ''imaginary'' language with a ''real'' language he carried further, rendering [[Rohirric]], related to an older form of Westron, by Old English, and names in the tongue of [[Dale (Middle-earth)|Dale]] in the north of [[Rhovanion]] by [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] forms, thus mapping the genetic relation of his fictional languages on the existing historical relations of the [[Germanic language]]s. A natural consequence of this is that the languages thus ''replaced'' were never worked out by Tolkien in any detail because they never appeared in the texts.
