'''Bohemia Visual Music''' (also referred to as '''"BVM"''' and '''"BVM TV"''') is a broadcast music video service in the United States.

==History==
The service began as '''Bohemia Afterdark''' in 1982 and operated in Phoenix, AZ but early history is unknown until 1990 when they moved to [[Portland, Oregon]]. In 1992 they began airing on [[KPDX]] Portland and then they move to [[KRCW-TV|KWBP]] in 1994. In 1995 they began airing on 22 [[Network One]] affiliates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/19980130012301/www.bohemiaafterdark.com/market.html|title=Bohemia Afterdark on Network One|work=Internet archive|accessdate=2009-01-20}}</ref> In 1997 Network One shut down and the service move to [[KOIN]] and in 2001, the service moved back to Phoenix, airing on [[KASW]], then in 2002, move to [[KPHO-TV]]. In 2003 they got their own station, '''KPHE-LP''', at the time broadcasting on channel 19 in [[Mesa, Arizona]], and changed their name to Bohemia Visual Music. KPHE moved to channel 44 in Phoenix in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/bohemiavisualmusic|title=Bohemia Visual Music History|work=Myspace|accessdate=2009-01-20}}</ref> Bohemia Visual Music changed their name to '''24-7 Videos''' for a few months from mid-2005 to early-2006, then reverted to Bohemia Visual Music.

In July 2006, KPHE replaced Bohemia Visual Music with Spanish-language programming, and BVM was without a broadcast outlet until September 2006, when they began broadcasting on [[KORS-CA]] digital subchannel 16.2 in Portland.

In March 2008, Bohemia Visual Music began broadcasting on [[KDOC-TV]] 56.3 in [[Los Angeles, California]] and [[KJKZ-LP]] 27 in [[Fresno, California]], but by July, both stations had ceased airing BVM.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2008/1/prweb612451.htm|title=KDOC 32.3 SDTV Launches to Los Angeles Metropolitan Area Television Viewers|date=January 10, 2008|work=Prweb|accessdate=2009-01-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJHnlYVklC8|title=Bohemia Visual Music on KJKZ|work=Youtube|accessdate=2009-01-20}}</ref>
