The '''6th Boat Race''' took place on the [[River Thames]] on 11 June 1842. [[The Boat Race]] is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].  In a race substantially interrupted by river traffic, Oxford beat Cambridge by a distance of four-and-a-half lengths.

==Background==
The Boat Race, first held in 1829, is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] competition between the [[University of Oxford]] (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues")<ref name=blues>{{Cite web | url = http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/06/theobserver | work = [[The Observer]] | title = Dark Blues aim to punch above their weight | date = 6 April 2003 | accessdate = 8 April 2014 }}</ref> and the [[University of Cambridge]] (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues").<ref name=blues/>  Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions, having defeated Oxford by 22 lengths in the [[The Boat Race 1841|previous year's race]].  They led overall with four wins to Oxford's one.<ref name=results/>

[[Cambridge University Boat Club]] received the challenge to race from the [[Oxford University Boat Club]] secretary Fletcher Menzies in late-1841, in which it was proposed that a race between the universities should take place in late June or early July of 1842.  Cambridge rejected the suggestion, maintaining that an Easter race would be preferable.<ref>MacMichael, pp. 93&ndash;94</ref>  A challenge from their captain, John Ridley, was then sent to [[Leander Club]], whose reply bemoaned the fact that they had insufficient numbers to provide an eight, suggesting a four instead.  This counteroffer was also rejected and Cambridge offered to row "any eight-oared crew from any club or clubs whatsoever."<ref>MacMichael, p. 95</ref>  After further, somewhat acrimonious discussion, it was agreed that Oxford would challenge Cambridge on 11 June 1842, with the caveat that the Light Blues would not row on the Thames before 8 June.<ref>MacMichael, p. 96</ref>

The race took place on a five-and-three-quarter-mile (9.2&nbsp;km) stretch of the Thames between [[Westminster Bridge]] and [[Putney Bridge]].<ref name=ox>{{Cite web |url = http://www.ox.ac.uk/about_the_university/university_year/the_boat_race/ | publisher = [[Oxford University Boat Club]] | title = The Boat Race | accessdate = 22 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | publisher = [[British History Online]] | title = Putney | accessdate = 29 October 2014 | url = http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43035}}</ref>  The [[Referee#Rowing|umpire]] for the race was W. H. Harrison, Commodore of the [[Royal Thames Yacht Club]].<ref>Burnell, p. 49</ref>

==Crews==
The Oxford crew weighed an average of 11&nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 9.375&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (73.9&nbsp;kg), about {{convert|5.5|lb|kg|1}} per rower more than their Light Blue opposition. None of the Oxford crew had rowed in previous Boat Races while Cambridge saw five return from the previous year's event, including John M. Ridley and [[Francis Penrose]] who had rowed in the [[The Boat Race 1840|1840 race]].<ref name=mac9798/><ref>Dodd, p. 287</ref>

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]] along which the Boat Race is contested]]
Cambridge won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start on the Middlesex side of the river, handing Oxford the Surrey side of the river.  Both boats started below the arches of Westminster Bridge.  Although Oxford made the better start, Cambridge pulled ahead and led until their course was diverted by river traffic including a steamer and a [[Lighter (barge)|lighter]], allowing the Dark Blues to retake the lead. Between the [[Millbank Prison|National Penitentiary]] and [[Wandsworth]], according to MacMichael "they were not once free from the swell of the steamers" but continued to extend their lead.  Once clear of the steamers, Cambridge began to close the gap in the last mile to Putney, but Oxford passed under [[Putney Bridge]] with a lead of four-and-a-half lengths in a time of 30 minutes 1 second.<ref name=results>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/results| publisher= The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Boat Race <U+2013> Results| accessdate = 6 November 2014}}</ref>  It was their first victory since the [[The Boat Race 1829|inaugural race]] in 1829, hence their first win on "London water".<ref>MacMichael, p. 98</ref>
