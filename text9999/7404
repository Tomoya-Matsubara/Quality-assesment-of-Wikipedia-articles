{{Infobox Olympics China}}
Originally having participated in Olympics for delegation of [[Republic of China at the Olympics|Republic of China]] (ROC) from 1932 to 1948, China competed at the '''[[Olympic Games]]''' under the name of the '''[[China|People's Republic of China]]''' (PRC) for the first time in 1952, at the [[1952 Summer Olympics|Summer Games in Helsinki]], [[Finland]], although they only arrived in time to participate in one event.<ref name="1952 olympics">[http://en.olympic.cn/games/summer/2004-03-27/121663.html 10th-15th Olympic Games: 1936-1952 [[Chinese Olympic Committee]].]</ref> That year, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) allowed both the PRC and the [[Republic of China]] (which recently relocated to [[Taiwan]] after the [[Chinese Civil War]]) to compete, although the latter withdrew in protest.<ref name="1952 olympics" /> Due to the dispute over the political status of China, the PRC did not participate in the Olympics again until the [[1980 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], United States.<ref name="1952 olympics" /> Their first appearance at the [[Summer Olympic Games]] after 1952 was the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], United States.<ref name="1984 olympics">[http://en.olympic.cn/games/summer/2004-03-27/121671.html 23rd Olympic Games: Los Angeles 1984 [[Chinese Olympic Committee]].]</ref>

The [[Chinese Olympic Committee]] in its current form was recognized in 1979.<ref name="1952 olympics" /> Before the [[Chinese Civil War]], athletes competed as the Republic of China (ROC) at the Olympics. The ROC continued to compete from 1952 to 1976 (Winter), but only representing athletes from the island of [[Taiwan]] (although the football team members of ROC in the 1960 Olympic Games were overwhelmingly Hong Kongers). The [[China and the United Nations|dispute over use of the name ''China'']] resulted in the PRC boycotting the Games completely during these years.  In 1979, the [[International Olympic Committee]] passed a resolution for the ROC team to be designated ''[[Chinese Taipei at the Olympics|Chinese Taipei]]'', and this opened the door for the PRC to finally join the Olympic movement.<ref name="1952 olympics" />

[[Hong Kong at the Olympics|Hong Kong]] has had a distinct [[National Olympic Committee]] since 1950 and has competed at the Games since 1952.<ref name="HK">[http://www.hkolympic.org/article/sfoc_history SF&OC History [[Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China]{{dead link|date=February 2014}}].]</ref>  After the territory was returned to the PRC and the [[Hong Kong]] [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]] was created in 1997, this arrangement has continued, with Hong Kong competing independently from the rest of the nation under the name ''[[Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China|Hong Kong, China]]''.<ref name="HK" />

==History==

===Early appearance and hiatus===

After the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, PRC sent a delegation to the [[Olympic Games]] for the first time at the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. The Chinese delegation (including athletes and officials) consisted of 38 men and 2 women,<ref name="China Olympism">{{cite journal |journal=Olympic Review |publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]] |author=(ed.) Monique Berlioux |issue=190<U+2013>191 |date=August<U+2013>September 1983 |title=China and Olympism |pages=pp. 583<U+2013>592 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1983/ore190/ORE190za.pdf |accessdate=2008-08-13|format=PDF}}</ref> including the [[China national football team|men's football team]], the [[China men's national basketball team|men's basketball team]], and one swimmer.  Only the swimmer arrived in time to take part in the official competition, and the football team played two friendly matches.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Mulvenney |title=Chen Chengda, China's almost Olympian |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Olympics/idUSPEK30776220080807?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0 |publisher=Reuters |date=2008-08-07 |accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref>  The Chinese stayed ten days in Helsinki and participated in the closing ceremony. The [[Republic of China]]'s (ROC) team withdrew from the Games on July 17 in response to the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]]'s decision to allow both PRC and ROC sportsmen and women to compete.<ref>{{cite news |title=1952: Zatopek wins gold at Helsinki |work=On This Day 20 July |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/20/newsid_3538000/3538602.stm |accessdate=2008-08-13 | date=1952-07-20}}</ref> This marked the beginning of the "two Chinas" conflict in the Olympic Movement, which resulted in the [[Chinese Olympic Committee]]'s withdrawal from the IOC in August 1958.

In the 1970s, China normalized her relations with the [[United States]] through [[Ping Pong Diplomacy]], and established diplomatic relations with the United States on January 1, 1979. The normalization finally lead to the [[Chinese Olympic Committee]]'s return to the IOC on October 25, 1979.<ref name="China Olympism"/> Just three months later, China participated in the [[1980 Winter Olympics]] at Lake Placid, USA, her first appearance in 28 years since the [[1952 Summer Olympics]]. China boycotted the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] at Moscow, USSR. Since the [[1984 Winter Olympics]] in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, China has participated in all subsequent Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics.

===Summer Games===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2012}}

====Sports summary====
Till 2012, China won three-quarters of all gold medals (152 out of 201) and two-thirds of all medals (311 out of 473) in six sports: '''[[Table tennis at the Summer Olympics|table tennis]], [[Badminton at the Summer Olympics|badminton]], [[Diving at the Summer Olympics|diving]], [[Gymnastics at the Summer Olympics|gymnastics]], [[Weightlifting at the Summer Olympics|weightlifting]], and [[Shooting at the Summer Olympics|shooting]]'''.

China recently dominated the gold medals in three of them, '''table tennis''', '''badminton''' and '''diving'''. China won all golds four times in '''table tennis''' and  one time in '''badminton''', and won three-quarters of all '''diving''' golds since 1992.

The total dominance in '''table tennis''' and '''badminton''' also leads to negative consequences. Due to the low participations among non-Asian countries, these two sports may lose their positions in the Summer Olympics just like '''baseball''' and '''softball''' did after 2008.

While through the years, Chinese athletes got many breakthroughs in other sports that are traditionally China's weak sports. Among them, '''swimming''' is the potential one that may get into top five sports of China in the near future.

====1984====

China won '''15 golds and ranked 4th''' at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] at Los Angeles, USA. While the good result is partly due to the boycott of the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Bloc]] countries.

'''[[Xu Haifeng]]''' won the first-ever gold medal for China in the '''shooting''' event of ''50 m Pistol''. It was called "a break through zero" - an event that brought great joy to the whole Chinese nation.<ref>http://en.olympic.cn/games/summer/2004-03-27/121671.html 23rd Olympic Games: Los Angeles 1984 [[Chinese Olympic Committee]].</ref>

'''[[Li Ning]]''' won six medals in '''gymnastics''', 3 golds, 2 silvers, and 1 bronze, earning him the nickname "Prince of Gymnasts" in China.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mulvenney |first=Nick |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Olympics/idUSSP4750620080808 |title='&#39;Li Ning, "Prince of Gymnasts" and businessman'&#39;|publisher=Reuters |date=2008-08-08 |accessdate=2014-02-24}}</ref> Six medals in a single Olympics is still the record for any Chinese athlete.

'''[[Deng Yaping]]''' won two '''table tennis''' golds in ''women's singles'' and ''women's doubles''. IOC president '''[[Juan Antonio Samaranch]]''' presented the gold medal to her after a promise made a year ago at [[1991 World Table Tennis Championships]].

'''Chinese women's basketball team''' lost final to the USA team, winning silver medal, China's best result in '''basketball'''.

====1996====

China won '''16 golds and ranked 4th''' again at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] at Atlanta, USA.

'''[[Fu Mingxia]]''' won two '''diving''' golds in ''women's 3 m springboard'' and  ''women's 10 m platform'', becoming the first female diver to accomplish this feat since 1960.

'''[[Deng Yaping]]''' won two golds in '''table tennis''' again, making her the first Chinese athlete to defend two events and win four Olympic gold medals. IOC president '''[[Juan Antonio Samaranch]]''' presented the gold medal to her again after a promise made four years ago at 1992 Olympics.

==Medalists==

===Summer Olympics===

Since Chinese athletes are more likely to compete in more than one event in the sport of '''[[Diving at the Summer Olympics|diving]]''', '''[[Gymnastics at the Summer Olympics|gymnastics]]''', '''[[Table tennis at the Summer Olympics|table tennis]]''', '''[[Swimming at the Summer Olympics|swimming]]''', and more likely to compete in several Olympic games in the sport of '''[[Shooting at the Summer Olympics|shooting]]''', most multiple medalists listed in the following three tables come from these five sports.

Among other six sports that may produce top multiple medalists, China may have breakthroughs in '''[[Fencing at the Summer Olympics|fencing]]''' and '''[[Cycling at the Summer Olympics|cycling]]''', while chances are slim in '''[[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|athletics]]''', '''[[Canoeing at the Summer Olympics|canoeing]]''', '''[[Rowing at the Summer Olympics|rowing]]''' and '''[[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|equestrian]]'''.

====Multiple medalists====
