{{nihongo|'''Wisps'''|<U+30A6><U+30A3><U+30B9><U+30D7>|Uisupu}} are fictional [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] creatures in [[Sega]]'s ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series of [[video game]]s. They debuted in the [[Wii]]/[[Nintendo DS]] game ''[[Sonic Colors]]'' in 2010, where [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] can use them as [[power-up]]s while he rescues others from [[Doctor Eggman]], who plans to use them for a [[mind control]] ray. Different forms of Wisps give Sonic different abilities, such as drilling underground, rolling along walls and ceilings, and blasting to extreme heights.

Wisps were added to ''Sonic Colors'' to offer alternate gameplay styles without adding [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog video game characters|other playable characters]], and to encourage players to explore levels more than once. They have since appeared in two other ''Sonic'' games and a [[comic book]] based on ''Colors''. The creatures and their integration into ''Sonic'' gameplay have received mixed reviews; generally, critics have praised the variety of gameplay styles they create, but criticized some control and pacing issues.

==Design and characteristics==
The Wisps are a race of [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] creatures who live on a grassy, lush planet called Planet Wisp and on a few surrounding planets.<ref name="ign"/><ref>{{cite video game|quote='''Tails (translating Mother Wisp's speech):''' "I was so worried when our planets were pulled apart from one another."|title=Sonic Colors (DS)|date=November 16, 2010|publisher=Sega|developer=Sonic Team}}</ref> The mother of all Wisps is a giant, pink one named Mother Wisp.<ref name="mother">{{cite video game|quote='''Tails (translating Mother Wisp's speech):''' "Thank you for helping my children.

Wisps made a return in ''[[Sonic Lost World]]'' for the [[Wii U]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]] in 2013. They bear little impact on the game's plot but offer alternate pathways through levels.<ref name="ign2"/><ref name="gt"/> Both versions of the game require techniques such as tilting the Wii U gamepad or 3DS, as well as tapping and drawing shapes on the touchscreen.<ref name="ign2"/><ref name="kotaku"/> Some Wisps return from ''Colors'', but there are also several new additions.<ref name="ign2"/>

==Reception==
Critics have given mixed opinions toward Wisps and their integration into ''Sonic'' gameplay. In general, [[IGN]]'s Arthur Gies called them "the big addition" to ''Sonic Colors'', outshining its polished physics and controls.<ref name="ign"/> Dave McComb of film magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' called them "cutesy" and "strange".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?GID=755|publisher=''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''|last=McComb|first=Dave|title=Sonic Colors|accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref>

Positive attention has been directed at the variety of Wisps available in ''Sonic Colors'' and ''Lost World'', and at the variety of gameplay styles as a result. Gies stated that "almost all of them add interesting quirks to Sonic's basic abilities."<ref name="ign">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/11/08/sonic-colors-wii-review|publisher=[[IGN]]|last=Gies|first=Arthur|date=November 8, 2010|accessdate=March 24, 2014|title=Sonic Colors Wii Review: Color us impressed.}}</ref> Reviewing the [[Nintendo DS]] version of ''Colors'', Tim Turi from ''[[Game Informer]]'' stated that "each adds an interesting new gameplay mechanic" to the game, singling out Violet Void as his favorite, and praised the ability to revisit old levels with Wisps unlocked afterwards,<ref name="gi">{{cite web|title=Sonic Colors: Dimps Crafts Another Amazing 2D Sonic Game|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/sonic_colors/b/nintendo_ds/archive/2010/11/09/sonic-colors-ds-review.aspx|publisher=''[[Game Informer]]''|last=Turi|first=Tim|date=November 9, 2010|accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref> a sentiment Gies agreed with.<ref name="ign"/> [[GameSpot]] writer Mark Walton called them an "amusing aside" in ''[[Sonic Lost World]]''.<ref name="gamespot"/> Steven Totilo of [[Kotaku]] praised ''Lost World''{{'}}s shifting gameplay pace, citing the Wisps as something that provides this.<ref name="kotaku">{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/sonic-lost-world-the-kotaku-review-x2-1448002806|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|last=Totilo|first=Steven|title=Sonic: ''Lost World'': The ''Kotaku'' Review x2|date=October 18, 2013|accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref> ''[[Nintendo Power]]''{{'}}s Steve Thomason identified them as "a truly interesting addition to the Sonic formula" amidst a series of missteps, and praised their "cleverly designed" variety.

However, control and pacing aspects of the Wisps in general, as well as individual types have been criticized. Reviewing ''Sonic Colors'' for the Wii, Gies opined that "for almost every useful ability there is a complete dud" and bemoaned the controls of Pink Spikes and Purple Frenzy.<ref name="gi wii">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/sonic_colors/b/wii/archive/2010/11/09/sonic-colors-ds-review.aspx|publisher=''Game Informer''|last=Turi|first=Tim|date=November 9, 2010|title=Sonic Colors: Sonic Drops The Ball Juggling The Second And Third Dimensions|accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref> Walton criticized Crimson Eagle, whose flight powers he considered imprecise.<ref name="gamespot">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-lost-world-review/1900-6415478/|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|last=Walton|first=Mark|title=A lost cause.|date=October 18, 2013|accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref> Justin Speer from [[GameTrailers]] stated that the Wisps "don't really feel like they belong and often require you to figure out unintuitive motion controls."<ref name="gt">{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/reviews/uy405a/sonic-lost-world-review|publisher=[[GameTrailers]]|last=Speer|first=Justin|title=Sonic Lost World - Review|date=October 18, 2013|accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref>  ''[[Hardcore Gamer Magazine]]''{{'}}s review of ''Lost World'' stated that none of the Wisps make satisfying use of the Wii U's gamepad.<ref name="hardcore"/> Chris Shilling of [[Eurogamer]] found them to "lead to clumsy touchscreen or gyro interludes that kill a level's pacing."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-10-18-sonic-lost-world-review|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|last=Shilling|first=Chris|title=Sonic Lost World review|date=October 18, 2013|accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref> Danny Cowan of [[Joystiq]] and Joe Skrebels from ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' thought similarly, respectively singling out Magenta Rhythm and Black Bomb.<ref name="joystiq">{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/10/18/sonic-lost-world-wii-u-review-d6947e79/|publisher=[[Joystiq]]|last=Cowan|first=Danny|title=Sonic: Lost World review: Spin cycle (Wii U)|date=October 18, 2013|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}</ref><ref name="bomb"/>
