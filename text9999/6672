'''U2''' ({{IPAEng|<U+02CC>ju<U+02D0><U+02C8>tu<U+02D0>}}) are a [[rock music|rock]] [[rock band|band]] from [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The band consists of [[Bono]] lead vocals and guitar, [[The Edge]] guitar, keyboards and backing vocals, [[Adam Clayton]] bass guitar, and [[Larry Mullen Jr.]] drums and percussion.

U2 formed in [[1976 in music|1976]] when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency. By the mid-1980s, however, the band had become a top international act, noted for their [[arena rock|anthemic]] sound, Bono's impassioned vocals, and The Edge's [[texture (music)|textural]] guitar playing. Their success as a live act was greater than their success at selling records, until their [[1987 in music|1987]] album, ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'',<ref>{{cite video | people =[[Paul McGuinness]] | title =Classic Albums: The Joshua Tree | medium =Television documentary | publisher =Rajon Vision |date=1998 }}</ref> increased the band's stature "from heroes to superstars" according to ''Rolling Stone''.<ref name="RS_xx">{{cite book | last = Gardner | first = Elysa | title = U2: The Rolling Stone Files | publisher = Rolling Stone Magazine | date = 1994 | location = New York | pages = page xx | isbn = ISBN 0-283-06239-8}}</ref> Their 1991 album ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' and the accompanying [[Zoo TV Tour]] were part of a significant reinvention for the band. A response to their own sense of musical stagnation, the [[Electronic dance music|dance]] and [[alternative rock]] revolutions, and criticism of their image, the experimentation continued for the rest of the 1990s. Since 2000, U2 have pursued a more traditional sound, while maintaining influences from their previous musical explorations. 

U2 have sold more than 170 million albums worldwide<ref>Vallely, Paul. "[http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article364606.ece Bono: The Missionary]". The Independent, May 2006. Retrieved 15 October 2006.</ref> and have won more [[Grammy Award]]s than any other band.<ref name="GRAMMY">[http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=&winner=u2&year=0&genreID=0&hp=1 GRAMMY Winners List] grammy.com. Retrieved 15 October 2006.</ref>
In 2005, the band were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in their first year of eligibility. Throughout their career, as a band and as individuals, they have actively campaigned for [[Amnesty International]], the [[ONE Campaign]], Bono's [[DATA]] (Debt, AIDS, Trade in Africa) campaign, and other causes.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1976 <U+2013> 1979)=== 
[[Image:U2-teenagers.jpg|thumb|right|U2 in the late 1970s: (left to right) Clayton, Mullen, Bono, Edge]]
U2 formed in Dublin, Ireland on [[25 September]] [[1976]].<ref>McCormick (2006), page 27</ref> <!--as an Irish topic, under Wikipedia rules this article uses International Dating i.e., dd/mm/yyyy not American dating mm/dd/yyyy.--> [[Larry Mullen Jr.]], then fourteen, posted a notice on his secondary school notice board ([[Mount Temple School, Dublin|Mount Temple Comprehensive School]]) seeking musicians for a new band. Seven teenage boys attended the initial practice in Mullen's kitchen. Known for about a day as "The Larry Mullen Band," the group featured Mullen on drums, [[Bono|Paul Hewson (Bono)]] on lead vocals, [[The Edge|Dave Evans (The Edge)]] and his brother Dick Evans on guitar, and initially Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin, two other friends of Mullen.<ref>Chatterton (2001), page 130</ref> Soon after, the group settled on the name "Feedback", because it was one of the few technical terms they knew.<ref>McCormick (2006), page 30</ref> Martin did not return after the first practice, and McCormick left the group within a few weeks. Most of their material consisted of cover versions, which the band explained was not their forte.

<blockquote class="toccolours" style="text-align:left; width:30%; float:left; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">We couldn't believe it. I was completely shocked. We weren't of an age to go out partying as such but I don't think anyone slept that night....Really, it was just a great affirmation to win that competition, even though I've no idea how good we were or what the competition was really like. But to win at that point was incredibly important for morale and everyone's belief in the whole project.<p style="text-align: right;"> <U+2014> [[The Edge]] on winning the CBS competition<ref>McCormick (2006), pages 46-47</ref></p></blockquote>

In March 1977, the band changed its name to "The Hype".<ref>de la Parra (2003), page 6</ref> Dick Evans, who was older and by this time at college, was becoming the odd man out. The rest of the band was leaning towards the idea of a four-piece ensemble and he was "phased out" in March 1978. During a farewell concert in the [[Presbyterian]] Church Hall in [[Howth]], which featured The Hype playing covers, Dick ceremoniously walked offstage. The remaining four band members completed the concert playing original material as "U2".<ref name="U2_by_U2_46-48">McCormick (2006), pages 46-48</ref> Steve Averill, a punk rock musician and family friend of Clayton's, had suggested six potential names from which the band chose "U2" for its ambiguity and open-ended interpretations, and because it was the name that they disliked the least.<ref>McCormick (2006), page 44</ref>

On Saint Patrick's Day in 1978, U2 won a talent show in [[Limerick, Ireland]]. The prize consisted of <U+00A3>500 and funding to record a demo, which was an important milestone and affirmation for the fledgling band.<ref name="U2_by_U2_46-48"/> The band recorded their first demo tape at Keystone Studios, in Harcourt Street, Dublin, in April 1978.<ref name="Bono">Wall, Mick, (2005).

ISBN 0233001593 (Promotional edition published by Paperview UK is association with the Irish Independent), pages 45</ref> In May, [[Paul McGuinness]], who had earlier been introduced to the band by ''Hot Press'' journalist Bill Graham, agreed to be U2's manager.<ref>McCormick (2006), pages 53-56</ref> U2's first release, an Ireland-only EP entitled ''[[Three (EP)|Three]]'', was released in September 1979, and was the band's first Irish chart success.<ref>de la Parra (1994), page 8</ref> In December 1979, U2 performed in London for their first shows outside Ireland, although they failed to get much attention from audiences or critics.<ref>de la Parra (1994), page 10</ref> In February 1980, their second single "[[Another Day (U2 song)|Another Day]]" was released on the CBS label, but again only for the Irish market.<ref>Stokes (1996), page 142; McCormick (2006), page 88</ref>

===''Boy'', ''October'', and ''War'' (1980 <U+2013> 1983)===
[[Island Records]] signed U2 in March 1980, and "[[11 O'Clock Tick Tock]]" became the band's first internationally released single that May.<ref>Stokes (1996), page 142</ref> The band's debut album, the [[Steve Lillywhite]]-produced ''[[Boy (album)|Boy]]'', followed in October, and received generally positive reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.u2.com/music/index.php?album_id=3&type=lp | title = ''Boy'' Review | publisher = Hot Press |date=October 1980 | accessdate = 2007-09-06}}; {{cite web | url = http://www.u2.com/music/index.php?mode=full&news_id=1073&news_type=review | title = ''Boy'' New Music Express review | publisher = New Music Express | date = 1980-10-25 | accessdate = 2007-09-06}}; {{cite web | url = http://www.u2.com/music/index.php?mode=full&news_id=1074&news_type=review | title = ''Boy'' Billboard review | publisher = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date = 1980-09-30 | accessdate = 2007-09-06}}; {{cite web | url = http://www.u2.com/music/index.php?mode=full&news_id=1075&news_type=review | title = ''Boy'' The Washington Post review | publisher = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 1980-09-30 | accessdate = 2007-09-06}}</ref> Although Bono's lyrics were unfocussed and seemingly improvised, a common theme was the dreams and frustrations of adolescence.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7088993/u2_here_comes_the_next_big_thing | title = U2: Here Comes the "Next Big Thing" | publisher = [[Rolling Stone]] | first = James | last = Henke | date = 1981-02-19 | accessdate = 2007-09-06}}</ref> The album included the band's first United Kingdom hit single, "[[I Will Follow]]". ''Boy'''s release was followed by U2's first tour of continental Europe and the United States.<ref>de la Parra (2003), pages 16,17</ref> Despite being unpolished, these early live performances demonstrated U2's potential, as critics noted that Bono was a "charismatic" and "passionate" showman.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4540228.stm | title = Voice of Influential U2 Frontman | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 2006-12-23 | accessdate = 2007-09-06}}</ref> 

The band's second album, ''[[October (album)|October]],'' was released in 1981 and contained overtly spiritual themes. Bono, The Edge, and Mullen had joined a Christian group in Dublin called the 'Shalom Fellowship', which led them to question the relationship between the Christian faith and the rock and roll lifestyle.<ref>Flanagan (1995), pages 46-48</ref> The album received mixed reviews and limited radio play. It did not sell well outside of the UK, which put pressure on their contract with Island and focussed the band on improvement.<ref>McCormick (2006), page 120</ref>

Resolving the doubts of the ''October'' period, U2 released ''[[War (album)|War]]'' in 1983.<ref>Stokes (1996), page 36</ref> A record where the band "turned pacifism itself into a crusade,"<ref>Reynolds, Simon.

''War'' was U2's first album to feature the photography of [[Anton Corbijn]], who remains U2's principal photographer and has had a major influence on their vision and public image.<ref>McCormick (2006), page 127</ref> U2's first commercial success, ''War'' debuted at number one in the UK, and its first single, "[[New Year's Day (song)|New Year's Day]]", was the band's first overseas hit.<ref>"New Year's Day" reached number ten on the UK charts, and received extensive radio coverage in the US, almost breaking that country's Top 50.

On the subsequent [[War Tour]], the band performed to sold-out concerts in mainland Europe and the U.S. The image of Bono waving a white flag during performances of "Sunday Bloody Sunday" became a familiar sight.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.motherjones.com/arts/books/1989/05/bono.html | title = Bono Bites Back | publisher = MotherJones.com | first = Adam | last = Block | date = 1989-05-01 | accessdate = 2007-09-06}}</ref> U2 recorded the ''[[Under a Blood Red Sky]]'' live album on this tour and a live video was released, both of which received extensive play on the radio and [[MTV]], helping expand the band's audience.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://netmusiccountdown.com/inc/artist.php?artist=U2 | title = Net Music Countdown: U2 | publisher =  netmusiccountdown.com | accessdate = 2007-09-06}}</ref> Their generally unfavourable record deal with Island Records was coming to an end, and in 1984 U2 signed an unusually lucrative extension. Forgoing a larger initial payment, they instead negotiated the return of their copyrights (such that they owned the rights to their own songs), an increase in their royalty rate, and a general improvement in terms.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Connelly | first = Christopher | title = Keeping the Faith | journal = [[Rolling Stone]] | date = 1984-03-14 | accessdate = 2007-09-06 }}</ref>

===''The Unforgettable Fire'' and Live Aid (1984 <U+2013> 1985)===
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="text-align:left; width:30%; float:right; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">We knew the world was ready to receive the heirs to [[The Who]].

''[[The Unforgettable Fire]]'' was released in 1984.

(McCormick (2006), page 151)</ref>

''The Unforgettable Fire'' has a rich and orchestrated sound. Under Lanois' direction, Larry's drumming became looser, funkier, and more subtle and Adam's bass became more subliminal; the rhythm section no longer intruded, but flowed in support of the songs.<ref name="STOKES_50-51">{{cite book| last = Stokes| first = Niall| title = Into The Heart: The Story Behind Every U2 Song| publisher = HarperCollins''Publishers''|date=1996| location = Australia| pages = pages 50-51| id = ISBN 0-7322-6036-1}}</ref> Complementing the sonic atmospherics, the album's lyrics are open to many interpretations, providing what the band called a "very visual feel".<ref name="PARRA_52-56"/> Bono's recent immersion in fiction, philosophy, and poetry made him realise that his songwriting responsibilities&mdash;about which he had always been reluctant&mdash;were a poetic one. Due to a tight recording schedule, however, Bono felt songs like "[[Bad (U2 song)|Bad]]" and "[[Pride (In the Name of Love)]]" were incomplete "sketches".<ref name="U2byU2_151">McCormick (2006), page 151</ref> "Pride (In the Name of Love)", about [[Martin Luther King]], was the album's first single and became the band's biggest hit at that point, including being their first to enter the U.S. top 40.<ref>Graham, (2004), page 23, 24</ref>

U2 interrupted their 1986 album sessions to serve as a headline act on [[Amnesty International|Amnesty International's]] [[A Conspiracy of Hope Tour]], but rather than be a distraction, the tour added extra intensity and power to their new music.<ref>McCormick (2006), page 174</ref> In his 1986 travels to [[San Salvador]] and [[Nicaragua]], Bono saw the distress of peasants bullied in internal conflicts subject to American political intervention. This first-hand experience later became a central influence on the album. The album juxtaposes antipathy towards America against the band's deep fascination with the country, its open spaces, freedom, and what it stands for.<ref>McCormick (2006), page 186</ref> The band wanted music with a sense of location, a 'cinematic' quality; the album's music and lyrics draw on imagery created by American writers whose works the band had been reading.<ref>Graham (2004), pages 27-30</ref>

In November 1991, U2 released ''[[Achtung Baby]]''. Hurt by criticism of ''Rattle and Hum'', the band made a calculated change in musical and thematic direction, their most dramatic since ''The Unforgettable Fire''.<ref>Flanagan (1995), pages 4-6; Graham (2004), page 43</ref> Sonically, ''Achtung Baby'' incorporated [[dance music|dance]], [[industrial music|industrial]], and [[alternative music]] influences of the time and the band referred to the album as the sound of "four men chopping down the Joshua Tree".<ref>[http://www.bullz-eye.com/music/deep_cuts/2005/U2_part_1.htm Deep Cuts: U2, Part I]</ref> Thematically, it was a more inward-looking and personal record; it was darker, yet at times more flippant, than the band's previous work. Commercially and critically, it has been one of the band's most successful albums and a crucial part of the band's early 1990s reinvention.<ref>Graham (2004), page 44</ref> Like ''The Joshua Tree'', it is cited by ''Rolling Stone'' as one of rock's greatest.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time/ The RS 500 Greatest Albums of All-Time] Rollingstone.com.

The band initially worked on ''Achtung Baby'' in [[East Berlin]], seeking inspiration and renewal on the eve of [[German reunification]]. Daniel Lanois produced the album with assistance from Brian Eno.<ref>Flanagan (1995), page 7</ref> In the Berlin sessions, conflict arose within the band over the quality of material and musical direction. While Adam and Larry preferred a sound similar to U2's previous work, Bono and The Edge were inspired by alternative and European dance music and advocated a change. Weeks of slow progress, arguments, and tension subsided when the band rallied around a chord progression The Edge had written, creating the song "[[One (U2 song)|One]]".<ref>Flanagan (1995), pages 6-11</ref>

The [[Zoo TV Tour]] of 1992&ndash;1993 was a [[multimedia]] event, and showcased an extravagant but intentionally bewildering array of hundreds of video screens, upside-down flying [[Trabant]] cars, mock transmission towers, [[satellite television|satellite TV]] links, [[subliminal message|subliminal text messages]], and Bono's over-the-top stage characters such as "The Fly", "Mirror-Ball Man", and "(Mister) MacPhisto". The extravagant shows were intentionally in contrast to the austere staging of previous U2 tours, and mocked the excesses of rock and roll by appearing to embrace these very excesses. The shows were, in part, U2's way to represent the pervasive nature of cable television and its blurring of news, entertainment, and home shopping.<ref>de la Parra (1994), pages 139-141; Flanagan (1995), pages 12,13, 58-61; Stokes (1996), pages 110-111</ref> Prank phone calls were made to [[George H.

[[Image:Zoo stage.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Zoo TV Tour|Zoo TV stage]]]]
Quickly recorded and released during a break in the Zoo TV tour in mid-1993, the ''[[Zooropa]]'' album continued many of the themes from ''Achtung Baby'' and the Zoo TV tour. Initially intended as an [[EP]], the band expanded ''Zooropa'' into a full-length [[LP album]]. It was an even greater departure from the style of their earlier recordings, incorporating [[techno]] influences and other electronic effects.<ref>Graham (2004), page 51</ref> Most of the songs were played at least once during the 1993 leg of the tour, which extended through Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan; half the album's tracks became fixtures in the set.<ref>de la Parra (2003), pages 166-172</ref>

===Passengers, ''Pop'', and PopMart (1995 <U+2013> 1998)===
In 1995, U2 released an experimental album called ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]]''. Brian Eno, producer of three previous U2 albums, contributed as a full partner, including writing and performing. For this reason, and due to the record's highly experimental nature, the band chose to release it under the moniker "Passengers" to distinguish it from U2's conventional albums. It was commercially unnoticed by U2 standards and it received generally poor reviews. However, the single "[[Miss Sarajevo]]" featuring [[Luciano Pavarotti]], and which Bono cites as one of his favourite U2 songs,<ref>McCormick (2006), page 261-262</ref> was a hit.

The subsequent tour, [[PopMart Tour|PopMart]], commenced in April 1997, and continued the Zoo TV theme of decadence. The set included a 100-foot tall golden yellow arch, a 150-foot long video screen, and a 40-foot tall mirrorball lemon. Like Zoo TV, it featured advertising influences and was intended to send a sarcastic message to those accusing U2 of commercialism.

<blockquote class="toccolours" style="text-align:left; width:30%; float:right; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">''All That You Can't Leave Behind'' is easy to relate to, full of solid songs that appeal to a wide audience with its clear notions of family, friendship, love, death, and re-birth.

Following the comparatively poor reception of ''[[Pop (album)|Pop]]'', U2 declared on a number of occasions that they were "re-applying for...The best band in the world".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,212605,00.html |title=Bono's Mission |accessdate=2007-03-10 |last=Tyrangiel |first=Josh |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=2002-02-23 }}</ref> Since 2000, the band has pursued a more traditional sound while maintaining influences from their previous musical explorations.<ref>McCormick (2006), pages 289 & 296</ref> 

''[[All That You Can't Leave Behind]]'' was released in October 2000 and reunited the band with producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois.

For the [[Elevation Tour]], U2 performed in a scaled-down setting, returning to arenas after nearly a decade of stadium productions. A heart-shaped stage and ramp permitted greater proximity to the audience. Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the new album gained added resonance. In October, U2 performed a series of sold-out shows at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]]. In later interviews, Bono and the Edge would call these New York City shows among their most memorable and emotional performances.<ref>{{cite video | title =VH1: All Access: U2 | medium =Television documentary | date=2005 | url = }}; McCormick (2006), page 309</ref> In early 2002, U2 performed during halftime of [[Super Bowl XXXVI]].<ref>de la Parra (2003), page 268</ref>

The band's next studio album, ''[[How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb]]'', was released on [[22 November]] [[2004]]. Sonically, the band was looking for harder-hitting rock than ''All That You Can't Leave Behind''.

Using a similar setup and stage design as the previous tour, the [[Vertigo Tour]] featured a setlist that varied more across dates than any U2 tour since the Lovetown Tour, and included songs not played since the early 1980s.

Despite these broad consistencies, U2 have introduced new elements into their musical repertoire with each new album. U2's early sound was influenced by bands such as [[Television (band)|Television]] and [[Joy Division]], and has been described as containing a "sense of exhilaration" that resulted from The Edge's "radiant chords" and Bono's "ardent vocals".<ref>Reynolds (2005), page 368</ref> U2's sound began with post-punk roots and minimalistic and uncomplicated instrumentals heard on ''Boy'' and ''October'', but evolved through ''War'' to include aspects of rock anthem, funk, and dance rhythms to become more versatile and aggressive.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/210489/review/6067451/war Rolling Stone: War: Review] rollingstone.com.

With their influence, both albums achieved a "diverse texture".<ref name="RS_JT"/> The songs from ''The Joshua Tree'' and ''Rattle and Hum'' placed more emphasis on Lanois-inspired rhythm as they mixed distinct and varied styles of gospel and blues music, which stemmed from the band's burgeoning fascination with America's culture, people and places. In the 1990s, U2 reinvented themselves as they began using [[synthesizers]], [[distortion (guitar)|distortion]], and [[electronica|electronic]] beats derived from alternative music, dance music, and [[hip-hop]] on ''Achtung Baby'',<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/u2/albums/album/116432/review/5941852/achtung_baby U2: Achtung, Baby: Music Reviews] rollingstone.com.

Bono's personal conflicts and turmoil related to family colour songs like "[[Mofo (song)|Mofo]]", "[[Tomorrow (song)|Tomorrow]]" and "[[Kite (song)|Kite]]". An emotional yearning or pleading is another frequent conveyance,<ref name="ABOUT_TOP10"/> in tracks such as "[[Yahweh (song)|Yahweh]]"<ref>[http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/u2/reviews/400 U2 - How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb Review] uncut.co.uk. Retrieved 18 February 2007</ref>, "[[Peace on Earth (U2 song)|Peace on Earth]]" and "[[Please (U2 song)|Please]]". The investigation of loss and anguish coupled with hopefulness and resiliency, which is central to ''The Joshua Tree'',<ref name="RS_JT"/> has motivated much of U2's songwriting and music. Some of this lyrical ideation has been amplified by Bono and the band's personal experiences during their youth in Ireland, as well as Bono's campaigning and activism later in his life.

While the band and its fans often affirm the political nature of their music, U2's lyrics and music have been criticized as apolitical because of their vagueness and "fuzzy imagery", and a lack of any specific references to actual people or characters.<ref>{{cite web|title=The soaring nothingness of U2|author=David Plotz|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2061087/|accessdate=2008-01-19}}</ref>

==Campaigning and activism==

Since the early 1980s, the members of U2&mdash;as a band and individually&mdash;have collaborated with other musicians, artists, celebrities, and politicians to address issues concerning poverty, disease, and social injustice.

In 1984, Bono and Adam Clayton participated in [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] to raise money for [[Ethiopia]]n [[famine relief]]. The initiative produced the hit charity single "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]", which would be the first among several collaborations between U2 and [[Bob Geldof]]. In July 1985, U2 played [[Live Aid]], a follow-up to Band Aid's efforts. Bono and his wife Ali, invited by [[World Vision]], later visited Ethiopia where they witnessed the famine first hand. Bono would later say this laid the groundwork for his Africa campaigning and some of his songwriting.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1001931-2,00.html Bono] time.com. Retrieved 16 January 2007; McCormick (2006), page 289</ref>

In 1986, U2 participated in the [[A Conspiracy of Hope Tour]] in support of [[Amnesty International]] and in [[Self Aid]] for unemployment in Ireland. The same year, Bono and Ali Hewson also visited [[Nicaragua]] and [[El Salvador]] at the invitation of the [[Sanctuary movement]], and saw the effects of the [[El Salvador Civil War]]. These 1986 events greatly influenced ''The Joshua Tree'' album, which was being recorded at the time.

In 1992, the band participated in the "Stop [[Sellafield]]" concert with [[Greenpeace]] during their Zoo TV tour.<ref>McCormick (2006), page 238</ref> Events in Sarajevo during the [[Bosnian war]] inspired the song "[[Miss Sarajevo]]", which premiered at a September 1995 [[Pavarotti]] and Friends show, and which Bono and the Edge performed at [[War Child (charity)|War Child]].<ref>McCormick (2006), page 262</ref> A promise made in 1993 was kept when the band played in Sarajevo as part of 1997's PopMart Tour.<ref>McCormick (2006), page 277</ref> In 1998, they performed in [[Belfast]] days prior to the vote on the [[Good Friday Agreement]], bringing Irish political leaders [[David Trimble]] and [[John Hume]] on stage to promote the agreement.<ref>McCormick (2006), pages 285-286</ref> Later that year, all proceeds from the release of the "[[Sweetest Thing]]" single went towards supporting the [[Chernobyl Children's Project]].

In 2001, the band dedicated "[[Walk On (song)|Walk On]]" to [[Burma|Burma's]] pro-democracy leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].<ref>McCormick (2006), pages 295-296</ref> In late 2003, Bono and the Edge participated in the South Africa HIV/AIDS awareness [[46664 (concerts)|46664]] series of concerts hosted by [[Nelson Mandela]]. The band played 2005's [[Live 8]] concert in London.  The band and manager Paul McGuinness were awarded [[Amnesty International]]'s [[Ambassador of Conscience Award]] for their work in promoting human rights.<ref>[http://www.artforamnesty.org/aoc/events_2005.html Ambassador of Conscience Award 2005] artforamnesty.org. Retrieved 5 February 2007</ref>

Since 2000, Bono's campaigning has included [[Jubilee 2000]] with Bob Geldof, [[Muhammad Ali]], and others to promote the cancellation of third world debt during the [[Great Jubilee]]. In January 2002, Bono co-founded the multinational [[NGO]], [[Debt, AIDS, Trade in Africa|DATA]], with the aim of improving the social, political, and financial state of Africa. He continued his campaigns for debt and HIV/AIDS relief into June 2002 by making high-profile visits to Africa.<ref>Kagan Daryn."[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/05/24/bono.africa.cnna/index.html CNN Access: Bono backs 'effective aid' for Africa]" CNN.com, May, 2002.

In late 2005, following [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita]], The Edge helped introduce [[Music Rising]], an initiative to raise funds for musicians who lost their instruments in the storm-ravaged [[Gulf Coast]].<ref>[http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/001351.html The Edge (U2) Announces 'Music Rising', a Campaign to Aid Musicians Affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita] modernguitars.com.

U2 and Bono's social activism have not been without its critics however. Several authors and activists who publish in politically left journals such as [[CounterPunch]] have decried Bono's support of political figures such as [[Paul Wolfowitz]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.counterpunch.org/okeefe03232005.html | author = Derrick O'Keefe | title = The Empire Moves and Co-opts in Mysterious Ways | accessdate = 2008-01-19}}</ref> as well as his "essential paternalism".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.counterpunch.org/browne05162006.html | author = Harry Browne | title = RED Light District: Bono's Independent | accessdate = 2008-01-19}}</ref> Other news sources have more generally questioned the efficacy of Bono's campaign to [[debt relief|relieve debt]] and provide assistance to Africa, with [[20/20]] declaring that "foreign aid often just makes politicians rich<U+2014>but leaves their people poor".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.abcnews.go.com/2020/Story?id=1955664&page=4 | title = Will More Foreign Aid End Global Poverty? | author = John Stossel and Patrick McMenamin | accessdate = 2008-01-19 }}{{cite web | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2092-1964947,00.html | title = Bono aid is making Africa sick | accessdate = 2008-01-19}}</ref>

==Other projects==
The members of U2 have undertaken a number of side projects, sometimes in collaboration with some of their bandmates. In 1985, Bono recorded the song "In a Lifetime" with the Irish band [[Clannad]]. The Edge recorded a solo soundtrack album for the film ''[[Captive Soundtrack|Captive]]'' in 1986,<ref>McCormick (2006), page 169</ref> which included a vocal performance by [[Sinead O'Connor]] that predates her own debut album by a year.
