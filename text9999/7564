'''''Retvizan''''' ({{lang-ru|''<U+0420><U+0435><U+0442><U+0432><U+0438><U+0437><U+0430><U+043D>''}}) was a [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] built before the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904<U+2013>05 for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]]. She was built by the American [[William Cramp and Sons]] because Russian shipyards were already at full capacity. Named after a captured Swedish [[ship of the line]], ''Retvizan'' was briefly assigned to the [[Baltic Fleet]], but was transferred to the [[Far East]] in 1902.

The ship was torpedoed during the Japanese surprise attack on [[L<U+00FC>shunkou|Port Arthur]] during the night of 8/9 February 1904 and [[Ship grounding|grounded]] in the harbour entrance when she attempted to take refuge inside, as her draft had significantly deepened from the amount of water she had taken aboard after the torpedo hit. She was refloated and repaired in time to join the rest of the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|1st Pacific Squadron]] when they attempted to reach [[Vladivostok]] through the Japanese blockade on 10 August. The Japanese battle fleet engaged them again in the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea]], forcing most of the Russian ships to return to Port Arthur after their [[squadron (naval)|squadron]] commander was killed and his [[flagship]] damaged. ''Retvizan'' was sunk by Japanese [[howitzer]]s in December after the Japanese gained control of the heights around the harbour.

The Japanese [[marine salvage|raised]] and repaired ''Retvizan'' after Port Arthur surrendered in January 1905. She was commissioned into the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] as {{nihongo|'''''Hizen'''''|<U+80A5><U+524D>}} in 1908. Based in [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]] when the Japanese declared war on [[German Empire|Germany]] in 1914, the ship was sent to reinforce the weak British squadron off [[British Columbia]], but diverted to [[Hawaii]] after reports of a German [[gunboat]] there. ''Hizen'' was unsuccessfully sent to search for other German ships after the Americans interned the gunboat in November. After [[World War I]] she supported the Japanese [[Siberian Intervention|intervention]] in the [[Russian Civil War]] and was disarmed in 1922 in accordance with the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]]. The ship was sunk as a gunnery target in 1924.

==Background==
[[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] had desired a [[warm-water port]] on the Pacific since his accession to the throne in 1894. He achieved this ambition in March 1898 when Russia signed a 25-year lease for Port Arthur and the [[Liaotung Peninsula]] with China. Japan had previously forced China to sign over the port and its surrounding territory as part of [[Treaty of Shimonoseki|the treaty]] that concluded the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894<U+2013>95, but the [[Triple Intervention]] of France, Russia, and Germany forced them to return the port in exchange for a sizeable increase in the indemnity paid by the Chinese. Japan invested much of the indemnity money in expanding its fleet, while Russia began a major building programme ("For the Needs of the Far East") to defend its newly acquired port.<ref>McLaughlin 2003, pp. 100<U+2013>03</ref>

Russian shipyards were already at maximum capacity so the Naval Ministry decided to order ships from abroad. [[Charles Henry Cramp]], the owner and son of the founder of [[William Cramp and Sons]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], had a relationship with the Imperial Russian Navy dating back to the late 1870s when his firm built the auxiliary cruisers [[Russian cruiser Afrika|''Afrika'']], [[Russian cruiser Asia (1878)|''Asia'']], [[Russian cruiser Europa|''Europa'']] and [[Russian cruiser Zabiiaka|''Zabiiaka'']]. Cramp also repaired several Russian warships visiting America in 1893, and he cultivated the contacts he made in the Russian Navy throughout the 1890s. As such, he was ideally positioned to offer to build a battleship for the Russians in his shipyard when they began to look abroad.<ref>McLaughlin 2000, pp. 48<U+2013>51</ref>

==Design and description==
[[File:Retvizan Brassey's1915 corrected.png|thumb|left|Plan and right elevation line drawing showing the armour (shaded areas) in the elevation view and the armament in the plan view|alt=]]
Preliminary design work on a battleship intended to equal the latest Japanese ships was begun over the winter of 1897<U+2013>98 by the Naval Technical Committee although the displacement was limited to {{convert|12000|LT|t|0}} for economic reasons. The basic design was that of the {{sclass-|Peresvet|battleship|4}} with its speed increased to {{convert|18|kn|lk=in}} using only two shafts and its steaming range increased to {{convert|5000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|kn}}. The Naval Ministry intended to conduct an international design competition with the ships being built abroad as the Baltic shipyards were at full capacity already.<ref>McLaughlin 2000, p. 51</ref>

Cramp's contacts kept him informed of the Russians' intentions and he sailed to [[Saint Petersburg]] to offer his services and design expertise in March 1898. Initially Cramp offered American designs to the Russians, including an updated version of the {{USS|Iowa|BB-4|6}} as it was a relatively close match for the Russian specification, but the Russians preferred their own designs. Both sides compromised and the final design was based on the Russian battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Potemkin||2}}. The new ship had four fewer {{convert|6|in|0|adj=on}} guns, but twice the coal capacity for improved range and a longer, slightly narrower hull for more speed. The contract was signed on 23 April 1898 for a price of $4,360,000. The [[protected cruiser]] {{ship|Russian cruiser|Varyag|1899|2}} was ordered at the same time for $2,138,000.<ref>McLaughlin 2000, pp. 52<U+2013>53</ref>

Cramp later designed the {{sclass-|Maine|battleship}}s built for the [[US Navy]], based on the ''Retvizan''. They had a lower [[quarterdeck]], two more six-inch guns and a slightly thicker belt.<ref name=m64/>

===General characteristics===
''Retvizan'' was {{convert|382|ft|3|in|m|1}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|386|ft|8|in|m|1}} long [[length overall|overall]]. She had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|72|ft|2|in|m|1}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|25|ft|m|1}}. The ship displaced {{convert|12780|LT|t|0|lk=in}} at normal load. Her hull was subdivided by fourteen transverse [[watertight compartment|watertight]] [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s; in addition a longitudinal centreline bulkhead divided the engine room. ''Retvizan'' had a complete [[double bottom]] that extended up the side to the lower edge of the armour [[deck (ship)|deck]]. She had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|3|ft|2|in|m|1}}. Her crew consisted of 23 officers and 722 enlisted men.<ref>McLaughlin 2000, pp. 54<U+2013>55</ref>

===Propulsion===
''Retvizan'' had two three-cylinder vertical [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple-expansion steam engines]] with a total designed output of {{convert|16000|ihp|0|lk=in}}. The Russian Navy preferred to use [[Belleville boiler]]s, but Cramp pressed for [[Niclausse boiler]]s, not least because he was the American agent for them, and was supported by the [[General Admiral]] [[Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich]]. Twenty-four Niclausse-type boilers provided steam to the engines at a working pressure of {{convert|18|atm|kPa psi|0|lk=on}}. On [[sea trial]]s, the engines produced {{convert|17111|ihp|abbr=on}} and a top speed of {{convert|17.99|kn}}, just under the contract speed of 18 knots. Not surprisingly, Cramp claimed that she reached 18.01 knots to avoid contractual penalties. Following ''Retvizan'''s arrival in Russia, the propeller pitch was adjusted and she exceeded 18 knots. She carried a normal load of {{convert|1016|LT|t}} of coal that provided a range of {{convert|4900|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}} and a maximum load of {{convert|2000|LT|t}} that gave {{convert|8000|nmi}} at the same speed.<ref>McLaughlin 2000, p. 55</ref>

===Armament and fire control===
''Retvizan''{{'}}s armament was built by the [[Obukhov State Plant|Obukhov Works]] in Saint Petersburg and shipped to America for installation. The main armament consisted of two pairs of [[Russian 12 inch 40 calibre naval gun|12-inch]] 40-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] guns mounted in French-style electrically-operated centre-pivot twin [[turret]]s fore and aft. These guns had a maximum elevation of +15<U+00B0> and could depress to -5<U+00B0>. The ship carried 77 rounds per gun and the guns could fire one [[Cartridge (firearms)|round]] every 80 to 90 seconds. They fired a {{convert|730|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2592|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} to a range of {{convert|12000|yd|m}}.<ref name=m57>McLaughlin 2000, p. 57</ref>

Eight of the twelve 45-calibre 6-inch [[Canet guns|Canet Pattern]] 1892 [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF) guns]] were mounted in [[casemate]]s on the main deck while four were mounted on the upper deck.<ref name=m57/> They fired shells that weighed {{convert|91.3|lb|kg|abbr=on}} with a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2610|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.<ref>Friedman, p. 261</ref> They had a maximum range of around {{convert|12000|yd|m}} and could fire three to five rounds per minute. The guns were provided with 200 rounds each.<ref name=m57/>

The ship carried many smaller guns to defend itself against attack by [[torpedo boat]]s. The largest of these were twenty QF {{convert|75|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} Canet Pattern 1892 guns. Fourteen of these were in embrasures on the main deck and six were mounted on the upper deck, between the six-inch casemates. Each gun was provided with 325 rounds.<ref>McLaughlin 2000, pp. 57<U+2013>58</ref> They fired an {{convert|4.9|kg|lb|adj=on|disp=flip}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2700|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} to a maximum range of {{convert|6405|m|yd|disp=flip}}.<ref>Friedman, p. 264</ref> The rate of fire was between twelve and fifteen rounds per minute. A total of twenty-four {{convert|47|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Hotchkiss gun]]s were carried; four in each [[Top (sailing ship)|fighting top]] and eight at each end of the superstructure.<ref name=m58/> They fired a {{convert|3.3|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|650|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on|disp=flip}}.<ref>Friedman, p. 228</ref> Six {{convert|37|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} Hotchkiss guns were mounted in the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] wings. They fired a {{convert|1.1|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1540|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.<ref>Friedman, p. 120</ref>

''Retvizan'' carried six {{convert|15|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s. Four were above water, one each in the bow and stern and the aft pair of [[broadside]] tubes; the forward broadside tubes were underwater. A total of 17 torpedoes were carried. The ship was designed to carry two second-class torpedo boats each equipped with a single torpedo tube and a small quick-firing gun. The ship could also carry 45 [[Naval mine|mines]].<ref name=m58>McLaughlin 2000, p. 58</ref>

The ship was fitted with Liuzhol [[Stadiametric rangefinding|stadiametric rangefinders]] that used the angle between two vertical points on an enemy ship, usually the waterline and the [[crow's nest]], to estimate the range. The gunnery officer consulted his references to get the range and calculated the proper elevation and [[deflection (ballistics)|deflection]] required to hit the target. He transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro-mechanical [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|fire-control transmission system]] to each gun or turret.<ref name=m58/><ref>Forczyk, pp. 27<U+2013>28, 57</ref>

===Armour===
The total weight of the [[Krupp armour]] was {{convert|3300|LT|t|0|abbr=on}} or 25.8% of the displacement. The armour was mostly made in the United States, although a contract was let for deck armour from Russia on 6 January 1899.<ref>McLaughlin 2000, p. 53</ref> The main [[waterline]] [[Belt armor|belt]] had a maximum thickness of {{convert|9|in|0}} and tapered to {{convert|5|in|0}} thick at its lower edge. It was {{convert|256|ft|1}} long and {{convert|7|ft|1}} high, of which about {{convert|3|ft|1}} was above the waterline. The 6-inch upper belt was as long as the main belt and was {{convert|7|ft|6|in|1}} high. Armour plates {{convert|2|in|0}} thick protected the ends of the ship to a height equal to that of the main and upper belts combined. Bulkheads {{convert|7|in|1}} thick provided transverse protection for the ship's vitals. The lower casemate armour was {{convert|5|in|0}} thick and armour screens {{convert|1.5|in|0}} thick separated each gun. The upper casemate armour consisted of five inches of armour plate with semicircular 1.5-inch thick [[gun shield]]s enclosing the guns.<ref name=m58/>

The front and sides of the turrets were {{convert|9|in|mm|0}} thick with 2-inch roofs. Their [[barbette]]s were {{convert|8|in|0}} thick above the upper deck, but diminished to {{convert|4|in|mm|0}} below it. The [[conning tower]] and its communication tube had {{convert|10|in|0|adj=on}} walls. The armour deck inside the central citadel was level with the top of the main belt and sloped down to meet the lower edge of the main belt. It was two inches thick on the flat and {{convert|2.5|in|0}} on the slope. Fore and aft of the citadel the deck thickened to {{convert|3|in|0}} to the ends of the ship and reinforced the [[Naval ram|ram]] bow.<ref name=m58/>

==Construction and service==
Named after the Swedish [[ship of the line]] ''R<U+00E4>ttvisan'' (Justice) which was captured by the Russians at the [[Battle of Vyborg Bay (1790)|Battle of Viborg Bay]] in 1790,<ref name=m61/> ''Retvizan'' was ordered on 2 May 1898 for delivery in thirty months. The detailed sketch design was forwarded at the end of 1898 to Saint Petersburg for approval and work commenced on the ship around that time, although she was not officially laid down until 29 July 1899 as yard number 300. Construction was delayed by a strike at the shipyard that began in August 1899 and continued until the strike collapsed in early 1900. Other delays were caused by differences between American and Russian shipbuilding techniques and the insistence of the Naval Ministry on approving any design changes even though a Russian commission had been sent to Philadelphia to supervise her construction.<ref>McLaughlin 2000, p. 54</ref>

Her armament arrived in Philadelphia missing electrical cables and with incomplete documentation, which required Cramp's electricians to piece things together themselves, for which Cramp charged an extra $50,000. She was launched on 23 October 1900 and ran her acceptance trials in October 1901. The trials were successful but revealed incomplete work that Cramp had to finish before he received his last payment. More work needed to be done on the armament, but it had to wait until she arrived in Russia. ''Retvizan'' was accepted on 23 March 1902, under the command of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Eduard Schensnovich]] who commanded her throughout her Russian service.<ref>McLaughlin 2000, pp. 54, 57, 59</ref>

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Marineschepen in de haven van Sabang op het eiland We TMnr 60011323.jpg|thumb|''Diana'' and ''Retvizan'' in transit at [[Weh Island]] on their way to Port Arthur in 1903]]
''Retvizan'' sailed for the [[Baltic Sea]] on 13 May 1902 and stopped to re-coal in [[Cherbourg]], France en route. After leaving Cherbourg a boiler tube burst on 14 June, scalding six stokers, three of them fatally. After her arrival she was fitted with radio equipment and took part in a [[naval review]] in [[Tallinn|Reval]] staged for the state visit of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] of Germany in August. Later that month she tested an experimental system for coaling at sea; it was deemed successful, but her equipment was removed before she sailed for the Pacific. ''Retvizan'' departed on 13 November 1902 in company with the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Pobeda||2}} and the [[cruiser]]s {{ship|Russian cruiser|Diana|1899|2}}, {{ship|Russian cruiser|Pallada|1899|2}} and {{ship|Russian cruiser|Bogatyr||2}}; she arrived at Port Arthur on 4 May 1903.<ref name=m61>McLaughlin 2000, p. 61</ref>

===Battle of Port Arthur===
{{main|Battle of Port Arthur}}
The Pacific Squadron began [[wikt:moor|mooring]] in the outer harbour at night as tensions with Japan increased, in order to react more quickly to any Japanese attempt to land troops in Korea.<ref name=m61/> Both Russia and Japan had ambitions to control both [[Manchuria]] and Korea which naturally caused problems between them. A further issue was the Russian failure to withdraw its troops from Manchuria in October 1903. Japan had begun negotiations to reduce the tensions in 1901, but the Russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve the problems. Japan interpreted this as deliberate prevarications designed to buy time to complete the Russian armament programs. The final straws were news of Russian timber concessions in northern Korea and the Russian refusal to acknowledge Japanese interests in Manchuria while continuing to place conditions on Japanese activities in Korea. These caused the Japanese government to decide in December 1903 that war was now inevitable.<ref>Westwood, pp. 15<U+2013>21</ref>

''Retvizan'' was on searchlight duty on the night of 8/9 February 1904 and attracted many torpedoes during the Japanese surprise attack that night. She was hit on the port side forward by a torpedo which blew a {{convert|220|sqft|0|adj=on}} hole in her side. Five men in the torpedo compartment were killed and all electrical power was knocked out. The ship took on enough water to give her a [[list (watercraft)|list]] of 11<U+00B0>; this was reduced to 5<U+00B0> by counter-flooding. A sail was used to cover the hole and steam was raised so she could head for the inner harbour. The {{convert|2200|LT|t|0}} of water she had taken aboard had increased her draft enough to cause her to ground in the harbour entrance. She was not refloated until 8 March, but played an important role in the meantime in defeating a Japanese attempt to seal the entrance with [[block ship]]s on 23<U+2013>24 February.<ref>McLaughlin 2000, pp. 61, 63</ref> Repairs began immediately after she was towed into the harbour and were completed on 3 June although no docks were available and a [[cofferdam]] had to be built. She sailed with the rest of the Russian squadron on 23 June in an abortive attempt to reach [[Vladivostok]]. [[Vice Admiral]] [[Wilgelm Vitgeft|Vitgeft]] returned to Port Arthur when he encountered the Japanese fleet, led by Admiral [[T<U+014D>g<U+014D> Heihachir<U+014D>]], shortly before sunset as he did not wish to engage the numerically superior Japanese in a night battle.<ref>Warner & Warner, pp. 305<U+2013>06</ref>

During the summer, ''Retvizan'' landed two 6-inch, two 47-mm and six 37-mm guns to reinforce the landward defences of the port. She was hit on 9 August by seven {{convert|4.7|in|adj=on}} shells fired by a battery with a narrow view of the harbour. Schensnovich was slightly wounded, a barge adjacent to the ship was sunk and she was holed below the waterline. The ship took on a 1<U+00B0> list from {{convert|400|LT|t}} of water, which was corrected by counter-flooding. The holes were patched, although the water was not pumped out, and she sailed the next day with the fleet in another attempt to reach Vladivostok. This sortie resulted in the Battle of the Yellow Sea.<ref name=m63>McLaughlin 2000, p. 63</ref>

===Battle of the Yellow Sea===
{{main|Battle of the Yellow Sea}}
The battle began as a long-range gunnery duel, during which the Russian ships hit the Japanese ships numerous times and forced T<U+014D>g<U+014D> to temporarily disengage. Over two hours after the start of the battle, the Japanese fleet closed the range and started shooting again at 17:35. Forty minutes later a shell struck ''Retzivan''{{'}}s forward turret near the [[Glossary of nautical terms#G|gun ports]], killing one turret crewman and wounding six others from the blast pressure. The impact knocked one 12-inch shell off its loading tray, crushing two other sailors and also setting fire to the canvas covering the gun ports. Fearing that the fire might spread, the surviving crewmen flooded the turret, knocking out its electrical system. The crew was able to get the turret partially functional within an hour.<ref>Forczyk, pp. 51<U+2013>52</ref>

[[File:Battleship Retvisan.jpg|thumb|left|''Retvizan'' sunk in Port Arthur|alt=]]
At approximately 18:40 hours on 10 August, during the final phase of the battle, the Russian [[flagship]] {{ship|Russian battleship|Tsesarevich||2}} was hit by 12-inch shells which killed Admiral Vitgeft and his immediate staff. The Russian battleship was turning out of control, disrupting the Russian formation. As the Japanese pre-dreadnoughts continued to pound the ''Tsesarevich'' with their 12-inch fire, ''Retzivan''{{'}}s captain boldly charged T<U+014D>g<U+014D>'s battleline in an attempt to divert the Japanese shellfire onto his ship.<ref>Forczyk, p. 53</ref> The Japanese battle line immediately shifted their fire onto the oncoming ''Retzivan'', firing so many shells that they were unable to adjust their fire due to the number of shell splashes engulfing the Russian battleship. As the Russian squadron was now disorganized, T<U+014D>g<U+014D>'s battleships were running low on ammunition and some ships' main guns were disabled, he turned the battle over to his cruisers and [[destroyer]]s. ''Retzivan'' had effectively ended the duel between the opposing fleets, and had saved ''Tsesarevich'' from destruction.<ref name=m63/> During the battle, ''Retvizan'' received 18 hits from large-calibre shells, and suffered 6 sailors killed and another 42 men wounded, including Schensnovich.<ref>Forczyk, p. 52</ref>

She was subsequently [[Siege of Port Arthur|besieged in Port Arthur]] and sunk in shallow water by thirteen {{convert|28|cm|adj=on|sp=us}} [[howitzer]] shells on 6 December 1904 after the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] gained control of the heights surrounding the harbour.<ref>Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 183</ref> Schensnovich was the senior surviving naval officer and signed the capitulation of Port Arthur for the Imperial Russian Navy on 2 January 1905.<ref name=m64>McLaughlin 2000, p. 64</ref>

===Japanese service===
''Retvizan'' was raised by the Japanese on 22 September 1905 and renamed ''Hizen'',<ref name=l9/> after [[Hizen Province]],<ref>Silverstone, p. 329</ref> two days later. The ship departed Port Arthur on 19 November and arrived at [[Sasebo Naval Arsenal|Sasebo]] on 27 November where her repairs lasted until November 1908. Her fighting tops were removed, her light weapons were replaced by Japanese ones, and her boilers were replaced by Miyabara boilers.
