'''Trafford''' is a [[metropolitan borough]] of [[Greater Manchester]], England. With an estimated population of about 211,800 in 2006,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=9666&More=Y |title=Population estimates 2006 by district |publisher=Statistics.gov.uk |date=21&nbsp;August 2007}} Retrieved on 17&nbsp;December 2007.</ref> it covers {{convert|41|sqmi|km2|0}}<ref name="Population density">{{cite web |title=Trafford Metropolitan Borough population density |publisher=Statistics.gov.uk |url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b=276784&c=Trafford&d=13&e=16&g=356269&i=1001x1003x1004&o=1&m=0&r=1&s=1197508310484&enc=1&dsFamilyId=789}} Retrieved on 13&nbsp;December 2007.</ref> and includes the towns of [[Altrincham]], [[Partington, Greater Manchester|Partington]], [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]], [[Stretford]], and [[Urmston]]. The borough was formed on 1 April 1974 by the [[Local Government Act 1972]] as a merger of the [[municipal borough]]s of Altrincham, [[Municipal Borough of Sale|Sale]], and [[Municipal Borough of Stretford|Stretford]], the [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]s of [[Bowdon, Greater Manchester|Bowdon]], [[Hale, Greater Manchester|Hale]], and [[Urmston Urban District|Urmston]] and part of [[Bucklow Rural District]]. All were previously in [[Cheshire]], apart from Stretford and Urmston which were in [[Lancashire]]. The [[River Mersey]] flows through the borough, separating North Trafford from South Trafford. Historically the Mersey also acted as the boundary between the [[Historic counties of England|historic counties]] of Lancashire and Cheshire.

The Trafford area has a long heritage, with evidence of [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age]], and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] activity. Amongst the relics of the past are two castles&nbsp;<U+2013> one of them a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]]&nbsp;<U+2013> and over 200 [[listed building]]s. The area underwent change in the late 19th century and the population rapidly expanded with the arrival of the railway. Trafford is the home of [[Manchester United F.C.]] and [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]] and since 2002 the [[Imperial War Museum North]].

Trafford has a strong economy with low levels of unemployment and contains both [[Trafford Park]] industrial estate and the [[Trafford Centre]], a large out-of-town shopping centre. Apart from the [[City of Manchester]], Trafford is the only borough in Greater Manchester to be above the national average for weekly income. Socially, the area includes both [[working class]] areas like [[Old Trafford, Greater Manchester|Old Trafford]] and [[Stretford]] and [[middle class]] ones such as [[Bowdon, Greater Manchester|Bowdon]] and [[Hale, Greater Manchester|Hale]]. [[Altrincham and Sale West (UK Parliament constituency)|Altrincham and Sale West]] is one of the two parliamentary constituencies in Greater Manchester to be held by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], the other being [[Bury North (UK Parliament constituency)|Bury North]].

== History ==
The choice of the name Trafford for the borough was a "compromise between Altrincham, Stretford and Sale", and "seemed to have wide support".<ref name="Clark101"/> A Liberal councillor for the [[Municipal Borough of Sale]] suggested "Crossford&nbsp;... whilst "Watlingford" was suggested by councillors in Hale, after the supposed name of an ancient [[Roman road]] in the district.<ref name="Clark101"/> Those names were rejected in favour of Trafford, because of the district's "famous sports venue, a major employer as well as historic associations", referring to [[Old Trafford]], [[Trafford Park]] and the [[de Trafford Baronets]] respectively.<ref name="Clark101">{{Harvnb|Clark|1973|p=101}}.</ref>

As a place name, Trafford is an [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] version of Stratford, deriving from the [[Old English]] words ''str<U+00E6>t'' (a street, more specifically a Roman road) and ''ford'' (a river crossing). The Metropolitan Borough of Trafford has existed since 1974, but the area it covers has a long history. [[Neolithic]] arrowheads have been discovered in [[Altrincham]] and [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]],<ref>Nevell (1997), pp.&nbsp;12<U+2013>13.</ref> and there is evidence of [[Bronze Age]] habitation in [[Timperley]].<ref name="Timperley Old Hall">Faulkner (2004), pp.&nbsp;1<U+2013>5.</ref> Fragments of [[Roman Britain|Roman]] pottery have been found in [[Urmston]], and Roman coins have been found in Sale. The Roman road between the [[legionary]] [[castra|fortresses]] at [[Chester]] ([[Deva Victrix]]) and [[York]] ([[Eboracum]]) crosses Trafford, passing through Stretford, Sale, and Altrincham.<ref>Nevell (1997), pp.&nbsp;17,&nbsp;20,&nbsp;75.</ref> The settlements in Trafford have been based largely around agriculture, although Altrincham was probably founded as a market town.<ref>Nevell (1997), p.&nbsp;51.</ref> Although the [[Industrial Revolution]] affected Trafford, the area did not experience the same rate of growth as the rest of [[Greater Manchester]].<ref name="90-91">Nevell (1997), pp.&nbsp;90<U+2013>91.</ref> A 100% increase in population in the Trafford area between 1841 and 1861 was a direct result of an influx due to the construction of the [[Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway]], which allowed residents to more easily commute from Trafford into Manchester.<ref name="90-91"/> The area developed its own centres of industry in [[Broadheath, Greater Manchester|Broadheath]] (founded in 1885) and [[Trafford Park]] (founded in 1897).<ref>Nevell (1997), pp.&nbsp;127,&nbsp;131.</ref> They have since declined, although Trafford Park still employs 40<U+2013>50,000 people.<ref name="Trafford Park1">{{cite web |title=Salford Quays & Trafford Park |publisher=Manchester Investment and Development Agency Service Ltd |url=http://www.investinmanchester.com/propertysites_salfordquays |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080117100823/http://www.investinmanchester.com/propertysites_salfordquays |archivedate = 2008-01-17}} Retrieved on 4&nbsp;May 2009.</ref><ref name="Trafford Park2">{{cite web |title=Trafford at GMeP.org |publisher=Greater Manchester e-Government Partnership |url=http://www.gmep.org.uk/ccm/content/map-links/trafford/|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071223210424/http://www.gmep.org.uk/ccm/content/map-links/trafford/ |archivedate = December 23, 2007|deadurl=yes}} Retrieved on 12&nbsp;December 2007.</ref> Today, Trafford is mostly a commuter area.

=== Population change ===
The table below details the population change since 1801, including the percentage change since the last census 10 years earlier. Although Trafford was formed as a Metropolitan Borough in 1974, figures have been generated by combining data from the towns, villages, and [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]]es that would later be constituent parts of Trafford. The greatest percentage change in the population occurred between 1851 and 1871, and was a result of the construction of the [[Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway]] in 1849.<ref name="90-91"/> The decrease by 7.7% in Trafford's population since the 1971 census mirrors the trend for [[Demography of Greater Manchester|Greater Manchester]], although on a smaller scale; this has been accounted for by the decline of Greater Manchester's industries, particularly those in [[Manchester]] and [[City of Salford|Salford]] but including those in Trafford, and residents leaving to seek new jobs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Trafford Metropolitan Borough key statistics  |publisher=audit-commission.gov.uk |url=http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/Products/BVIR/9AC95DA0-C6A1-4b9b-9A0D-D305DE72FFC8/ManchesterSalford.pdf|format=PDF}} Retrieved on 22&nbsp;February 2008.</ref>

== Economy ==
[[Image:TraffordCentresat.png|thumb|right|Aerial view of the [[Trafford Centre]]]]
Historically, the economy of the Trafford area has been dominated by agriculture. This continued to some extent even during the [[Industrial Revolution]], as the textile industry in Trafford did not develop as quickly or to the same extent as it did in the rest of [[Greater Manchester]].<ref name="Nevell pg88-91">Nevell (1997), pp.&nbsp;88<U+2013>91</ref> There are only two known 18th-century mill sites in Trafford, compared with 69 known in [[Tameside]] and 51 in [[Manchester]].<ref name="Nevell pg88-91"/> After reaching a high of 43% in 1812, employment in the textile industry in Trafford declined to 12% according to the 1851 census.<ref name="Nevell pg88-91"/> The textile industry in Trafford could not compete with that in places such as [[Manchester]], [[Oldham]], and [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], partly because of a reluctance to invest in industry on the part of the two main land owners in the area: the [[Earl of Stamford|Stamfords]] and the [[De Trafford Baronets|de Traffords]].<ref name="Nevell pg88-91"/>

[[Trafford Park]] was founded in 1897, and at its peak in 1945 employed 75,000&nbsp;people.<ref>Nevell (1997), pp.&nbsp;130<U+2013>131</ref> As well as being the world's first planned [[industrial estate]],<ref name="Nichols pg xiii">Nicholls (1996), p.&nbsp;xiii.</ref> it is Europe's largest business park.

Trafford is a prosperous area, with an average weekly income of <U+00A3>394, and apart from Manchester it is the only borough in [[Greater Manchester]] to be above the national average for weekly income and is on average the highest in the county.

As of the 2001 UK census, Trafford had 151,445 residents aged 16 to 74. 2.5% of these people were students with jobs, 5.7% looking after home or family, 5.4% permanently sick or disabled and 2.8% economically inactive for other reasons.

This was roughly in line with national figures, except for the proportion of jobs in agriculture which is less than half the national average, reflecting Trafford's suburban nature and its proximity to the centre of Manchester.<ref>{{cite web |title=Trafford Local Authority industry of employment |publisher=Statistics.gov.uk |url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b=276784&c=Trafford&d=13&e=16&g=356269&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1196694202699&enc=1&dsFamilyId=119}} Retrieved on 3&nbsp;November 2007.</ref>

A study commissioned by [[Experian]] rated Trafford as the strongest and most resilient borough in [[North West England]] to dealing with sudden changes in the economy. Trafford's low reliance on vulnerable businesses in the current recession and its high proportion of multinational companies were two factors which give the borough its high ranking.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-11204571 |title=Trafford best-placed to resist economic woes |author=BBC |date=9 September 2010 |work= |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 September 2010}}</ref>
