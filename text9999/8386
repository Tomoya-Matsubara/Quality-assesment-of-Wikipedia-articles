The '''Ormeau Road''' is a road in south [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]]. [[Ormeau Park]] is adjacent to it. It forms part of the [[A24 road (Northern Ireland)|A24]].

==History==
Having previously been the home of [[George Chichester, 2nd Marquess of Donegall]], a road was first built in 1815, when it was known more commonly as the New Ballynafeigh Road before eventually taking on the name of the [[Ormeau Park]].<ref name="orangenet.org">[http://www.orangenet.org/ballynafeigh.htm Let us take a 'walk' round Ballynafeigh]</ref> The road, although already well known as one of the key southern arterial routes into Belfast gained some small extra measure of notoriety because of the tensions regarding the [[Orange Order]]'s attempts to march there on the [[The Twelfth|Twelfth]].

==Areas of the Ormeau Road==
===The Markets area===
The Markets area marks the beginning of the Ormeau Road as it comes out of [[Belfast city centre]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The area is based around Cromac Street and the historic [[St George's Market]].<ref>[http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/stgeorgesmarket/index.asp St George's Market]</ref> The area was substantially redeveloped in the 1980s and more money has been earmarked for further regeneration.<ref>[http://www.nihe.gov.uk/news/news.asp?Id=593 <U+00A3>1/2m Makeover for the Markets Area of South Belfast - 7 April 2004]</ref>

A working-class [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] area, it was something of a stronghold for the [[Official Irish Republican Army]], with leading figures such as [[Joe McCann]] active in the area. McCann's killing in 1972 weakened the movement as a whole and saw the area become more open to the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] and [[Irish National Liberation Army]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Four members of the INLA have their deaths commemorated in a plaque in the area.<ref>[http://irsm.org/statements/irsp/current/030511.html Dedication of an INLA memorial in the Markets] from the [[Irish Republican Socialist Party]] website</ref>

The area's proximity to the city's defunct [[music hall]]s led to a number of performers staying temporary lodgings in the area's Joy Street, with [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Laurel & Hardy]] amongst the leading names to have lodged there.<ref>[http://www.irishecho.com/search/searchstory.cfm?id=10049&issueid=227 Cobblestone cantata: music of May Street]</ref>

The area was also the birthplace of [[snooker]] star [[Joe Swail]]<ref>[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/community-telegraph/south-belfast/news/new-murals-chart-rich-heritage-of-the-markets-13938138.html New murals chart rich heritage of the Markets]</ref> and home to Belfast 'hard man' Silver McKee.<ref>[http://buckalecrobinson.rushlightmagazine.com/char.html Silver McKee & Stormy Weather - By Joe Graham]</ref> [[Jackie Wright]], famous as [[Benny Hill]]'s sidekick came from Joy Street.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===The Gasworks===
[[File:Gasworks Belfast.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Gasworks from Cromac Street, October 2010]]
Close to the Markets is the Belfast Gasworks, built between 1887 and 1893 by such leading Belfast industrialists as Robert Watt, James Stelfox and John Lanyon. It remained open for its original purpose until 1988.<ref>[http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/product.aspx?ProductID=3442 The Gasworks Belfast]</ref> The area has been substantially redeveloped under the [[Laganside Corporation]] and now includes a number of office buildings for companies such as [[Halifax (United Kingdom bank)|Halifax]]<ref>[http://www.laganside.com/gasworks.asp Laganside Gasworks page]</ref>
The Gasworks is also home to the Radisson Blu Hotel Belfast.

===Donegall Pass===
Donegall Pass faces the Gasworks and represents a [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] interface between the [[Irish republicanism|republican]] areas of the Markets and the Lower Ormeau. It leads on to the [[Donegall Road]]. In the years since 2004 "the Pass" has seen instances of [[racism]] rise as [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Poles|Polish]] communities have become established in the area. Combating this growth has been one of the areas of concern of the Donegall Pass Community Forum, founded in 1996.<ref>[http://www.donegallpass.org/html/the_shared_history_project_pag.html Shared History Project]</ref>

===Havelock House===
The headquarters of [[UTV plc]], [[Havelock House, Belfast|Havelock House]], have been situated between Donegall Pass and the Lower Ormeau since the station first went on air in October 1959.<ref>[http://www.utvtoday.co.uk/images.html Images of Havelock House]</ref>

The headquarters of [[Belfast CityBeat]] are situated very close to Havelock House, just over the Havelock Bridge (which crosses the main Belfast to Dublin railway line which runs under the Ormeau Road).

===Lower Ormeau===
[[File:Sinn Fein Ormeau.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Sinn F<U+00E9>in]] South Belfast office, Lower Ormeau Road]]
The Lower Ormeau is regarded by those who live there as the main nationalist<U+2013>republican area of the Ormeau Road and includes the [[Belfast South (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast South]] constituency offices of both [[Sinn F<U+00E9>in]] and the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) who hold the South Belfast seat at Westminster.

The area suffered a number of attacks during [[the Troubles]], when both Protestant and Catholic working-classes were killed: most notably on 5 February 1992 when two gunmen attacked Sean Graham's bookmakers, killing four men and a fifteen-year-old boy in the shop. The attack was claimed by the "Ulster Freedom Fighters", a cover name used by the [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA).<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch92.htm#Feb Chronology of the Conflict: February 1992], CAIN</ref> Popular opinion in the area blamed [[Joe Bratty]] and Raymond Elder, two leading UDA members from the nearby Annadale Flats, although it has since been claimed that, whilst Bratty and Elder were involved in planning the massacre, the gunmen were actually brought in from east Belfast.<ref>H. McDonald & J. Cusack, ''UDA'', Dublin: Penguin Ireland, 2004, pp. 222<U+2013>224</ref> Bratty and Elder were both killed by the Provisional IRA on the Ormeau Road on 31 July 1994.<ref>P. Taylor, ''Loyalists'', London: Bloomsbury, 2000, p. 231</ref> The Upper Ormeau UDA was also responsible for the murder of Theresa Clinton, a housewife who lived on Balfour Avenue during the same period. Bratty and Elder were widely suspected of involvement and their killing by the IRA led to celebrations amongst ordinary Catholics in the area.<ref>The UTV news report of the killing of Bratty and Elder described a 'jubilant attitide' on the lower Ormeau, see UTV news, 31/7/1994</ref> The gang, which they led, were responsible for a numerous murders in the area.<ref>For a full list of their victims, see ''Lost Lives'', (Ed, Feeney, McKetterick) Index; reference, Ormeau Rd</ref>

The area was the scene of controversy due to the parade by bands from Ballynafeigh Orange Lodge over the Ormeau Bridge and through the area. As well as the general opposition of the community to the parades, claims were also made that members of the lodge had demonstrated triumphalism over the murder of five men in Sean Graham's bookmakers by the UDA.<ref>[http://www.indymedia.ie/article/74539 Orangeism - making triumphalist sectarianism respectable]</ref> In 1996, the dispute spilled over into conflict between the Lower Ormeau Residents' Action Group and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] after widespread rioting led the police to effectively seal off the area for two days.<ref>[http://www.belfastexposed.com/archive/image.php?parentid=17&catid=64&imgid=578 Protest: Lower Ormeau Road 1996]</ref> The [[Parades Commission]] initially supported the marchers in the dispute<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/parade/docs/pc6798.htm Parades Commission Determination on Ormeau Road March 13 July 1998]</ref> although since 1999 parades have been banned from the area, even leading to the Orange Order briefly using the Ormeau Park as its meeting place instead of [[Edenderry, County Down|Edenderry]].<ref>[http://www.belfastexposed.com/archive/image.php?parentid=17&catid=64&imgid=578Protest: Lower Ormeau Road 1996]</ref>

Until 1999, the [[North of Ireland FC|North of Ireland Cricket and Football Club]]'s home stadium <U+2013> one of the earliest international rugby venues in Ireland<ref>See references to Ireland's matches against Scotland from 1877 to 1889: [http://www.irishrugby.ie/18104_18114.php Ireland v Scotland - Head to Head Statistics]</ref> - was in the area, although, following a series of perceived sectarian arson attacks<ref>D. Sharrock, <U+2018>Goodbye to all that, as the Belfast sporting club where W.G. Grace swung his bat uproots for Protestant sanctuary<U+2019>, ''The Guardian'', 13 August 1997, p. 6.

Available at http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/ISS/ISS2201/ISS2201d.pdf</ref>, the club's merger into the [[Belfast Harlequins]] has seen the demolition of the stadium, which has been redeveloped as housing, known as Lavinia Square and Mews.<ref>[http://www.clanmil.org/housing/belfast_family.html Clanmil Housing site]</ref>

===Ormeau Bridge===
[[File:Ormeau Bridge, Belfast, May 2010 (02).JPG|thumb|left|200px|Ormeau Bridge, May 2010]]
The Ormeau Bridge links the so-called or self-styled, Lower Ormeau to the rest of the road, crossing the [[River Lagan]]. Work began on the bridge in 1815 and was completed by 1818 or 1822. The bridge was demolished as unusable however and was not fully rebuilt until 1863.<ref name="orangenet.org"/> The Lagan forms the boundary between [[County Antrim]], encompassing the inner-city districts, and [[County Down]], lying to the south-east.

===Ormeau Park===
[[Image:Ormeau.JPG|right|thumb|Entrance gates to the Ormeau Park, 2009]]
The Ormeau Park is across the bridge from the Lower Ormeau. It is the city's oldest municipal park, dating back to 1871 and stretches from the Ormeau Road to the [[Ravenhill, Belfast|Ravenhill Road]]. It is also the home of [[Ormeau Golf Club]]. Outside the Park a [[Segregated cycle facilities|cycle path]] has been added to the road.<ref>[http://www.nici.org.uk/campaining/campaign_index.htm NICI campaigning]</ref>

The park has been used for Orange gatherings on the Twelfth as well as other open air events such as [[revival meeting]]s. It was also the scene of the first meeting of the [[Ulster Vanguard]] on 18 March 1972 when [[William Craig (politician)|William Craig]] called on his followers to attend following his decision to leave the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]. Joined by 100,000 followers Craig made a controversial speech in which he stated that "we must build up a dossier of the men and women who are a menace to this country because if and when the politicians fail us, it may be our job to liquidate the enemy".<ref>P. Taylor, ''Loyalists'', London: Bloomsbury, 2000, p. 96</ref>

The park was considered as an alternative venue for a new multi-purpose sports stadium, although [[Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister|First Minister]] [[Ian Paisley]] vetoed the plans.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6228802.stm Paisley says no to Ormeau stadium]</ref>

===Ormeau Bakery===
[[File:OrmeauBakery.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Redeveloped Ormeau Bakery, October 2010]]
The Ormeau Bakery was the home of Ormo bread, formerly the largest independent bakery in [[Ireland]]. The company celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2002 but was then bought out by [[Mother's Pride]], leading to a closing of the site.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1847470.stm Mother's Pride to buy Ormo bakery]</ref> The bakery has been redeveloped as upmarket, luxury apartments with roof gardens and other decorative touches according to designs by [[Diarmuid Gavin]].<ref>[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/article2717747.ece People flash the dough for Ormeau]</ref>

The Ormeau Bakery is situated between the loyalist Annadale housing estate and the middle class area around Park Road, North Parade and South Parade. Cooke Centenary Church, a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] place of worship that faces the Bakery, is unique on the road as having no number in its postal address being simply Ormeau Park, Belfast.<ref name="orangenet.org"/>

===Ballynafeigh Orange Lodge===
[[Image:Ballynafeighorange.JPG|right|thumb|180px|Ballynafeigh Orange Lodge, 2009]]
Ballynafeigh Orange Lodge is situated on the Ormeau Road and is the main centre for Orangeism in the area. The Lodge was formed in 1887 according to the plaque above the door. An [[Apprentice Boys of Derry]] flute band is affiliated to the Lodge.<ref>[http://www.lowerwoodstock.co.uk/babfb/ Ballynafeigh Apprentice Boys Flute Band]</ref>

===Upper Ormeau===
Encompassing the areas of Rosetta and Galwally, the Upper Ormeau is a largely middle class area. It is served by the [[Forestside Shopping Centre]] of [[Newtownbreda]]. Its local schools are Wellington college,<ref>[http://www.axcis.co.uk/46878.html Wellington College]</ref> Aquinas Grammar School<ref>[http://www.aquinasgrammar.com/ Aquinas Grammar School]</ref> And St Joseph's College<ref>[http://knock.co.uk/DisplaySchool.aspx?Schoolid=a324b236-dadb-4d3f-b27d-a75e94f92e0c St Joseph's College]</ref> (the latter having been formed in September 1992 by the amalgamation of St Monica's girls' school and St Augustine's boys' school). The area is also home to the Rosario Youth Club, whose soccer team [[Rosario YC F.C.]] play in Division 1A of the [[Northern Amateur Football League]]. The clubs teams, which compete in a number of age groups, are based at the Ulidia playing fields, opposite the Orange Hall.<ref>[http://www.rosariofc.com/htmlsite/aboutus.html Rosario website]</ref> [[Bredagh GAA|Bredagh GAC]] play in the nearby Cherryvale Playing Fields.<ref>[http://www.bredaghgac.com/ Bredagh GAC Homepage]</ref> The Gate Lodge, a historic building within the grounds of the Good Shepherd Church at the Ormeau/Ravenhill Road roundabout, restored in 2009, is now home to the [[Belfast Buildings Preservation Trust]].<ref>[http://www.bbpt.org/contact.html Belfast Buildings Preservation Trust contact details]</ref>
