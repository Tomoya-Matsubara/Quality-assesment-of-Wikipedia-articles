'''''Fuck''''' is a 2005 American documentary film by director [[Steve Anderson (director)|Steve Anderson]] about the word "[[fuck]]".{{efn|''Fuck'' is styled as ''FUCK'', ''F<U+2605>CK'', or ''F*CK''<ref name="baumgarten" /><ref name="financialtimes" /> and alternatively titled ''Fuck: A Documentary'' and ''The F-Bomb: A Documentary''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://dvd.netflix.com/Movie/The-F-Bomb-A-Documentary/70058003|accessdate=June 8, 2013|year=2013|work=[[Netflix]]|title=The F-Bomb: A Documentary|publisher=Netflix.com, Inc.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_f_bomb_a_documentary/|accessdate=June 8, 2013|year=2013|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|title=The F-bomb: A Documentary|publisher=Flixter, Inc.}}</ref>}} The film argues that the word is an integral part of societal discussions about [[freedom of speech]] and [[censorship]]. It looks at the term from perspectives which include art, linguistics, society and comedy, and begins with a segment from the 1965 propaganda film ''[[Perversion for Profit]]''. Scholars and celebrities analyze conceptions of the word from differing perspectives. [[Sam Donaldson]] talks about the versatility of the word, and [[Billy Connolly]] points out it can be understood despite one's language or location. [[Alanis Morissette]] comments that the word contains power because of its taboo nature. The film features the last recorded interview of author [[Hunter S. Thompson]] before his suicide. Scholars, including linguist [[Reinhold Albert Aman]], journalism analyst [[David Shaw (writer)|David Shaw]] and [[Jesse Sheidlower]] of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', explain the history and evolution of the word. Language professor [[Geoffrey Nunberg]] observes that the word's treatment by society reflects changes in our culture during the 20th century.

Anderson was exposed to public conceptions surrounding "fuck" by comedian [[George Carlin]]'s monologue "[[Seven dirty words|Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television]]". He named the film ''Fuck'' despite anticipating problems with marketing. [[Bill Plympton]] animated sequences illustrating key concepts in the film. The documentary was first shown at the [[AFI Film Festival]] on November 7, 2005, at [[ArcLight Hollywood]] in [[Hollywood, California]].

''Fuck'''s reviews were mixed. [[A. O. Scott]] called the film a battle between advocates of morality and supporters of freedom of expression. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' criticized its length and repetitiveness. In his 2009 book ''[[Fuck: Word Taboo and Protecting Our First Amendment Liberties|Fuck]]'', law professor [[Christopher M. Fairman]] called the movie "the most important film using 'fuck'".<ref name="fairman" /> The [[American Film Institute]] said "Ultimately, ''Fuck'' is a movie about free speech&nbsp;... Freedom of expression must extend to words that offend. Love it or hate it, fuck is here to stay."<ref name="vincelli" />

[[File:Fuck film interview grid.tif|thumb|Documentary director [[Steve Anderson (director)|Steve Anderson]] said that the title of his film was ''Fuck'', but he allowed marketing designs with an [[asterisk]].<ref name="fairman" />|alt=Fuck with asterisk instead of letter U, with background of tiled images of interviewees from film]]
In an interview about the film on his website, Anderson discussed his problems when he decided to name his film ''Fuck'' instead of a censored version of the word.<ref name="fairman" /> He said he always wanted to call the documentary ''Fuck'', because it succinctly described the film's contents.<ref name="fairman" /> There were inherent problems with this approach, including an inability to advertise the film with its true title in mainstream media such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''Los Angeles Times'' (they used four asterisks instead), although the real title might be permitted in [[alternative newspaper]]s like ''[[LA Weekly]]''.<ref name="fairman" /><ref name="jaystonecanwest" /> Anderson also anticipated problems displaying the film's title during [[film festival]]s on theatre [[Marquee (sign)|marquees]].<ref name="fairman" />

Anderson explained that although the title of his documentary was ''Fuck'', he allowed alternate designations using an [[asterisk]].<ref name="fairman" /> The film and content he controlled would refer to the title as ''Fuck'', including theatrical and DVD editions.<ref name="fairman" /> He concluded that his struggle reflected the debate alluded to by the documentary, and this realization motivated him to stand firm on the film's title.<ref name="fairman" /> Because the film is about how a taboo word can impact culture, it was important to keep ''Fuck'' as its title.<ref name="couldoscar">{{cite news|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|location=Canada|title=Could Oscar be a four-letter word?|date=March 27, 2006|page=1; Section: The Globe Review|publisher=CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.}}</ref>

In an interview with the ''Santa Barbara Independent'', Anderson said that a schoolteacher in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania had been fired for showing the documentary to his students.<ref name="rebeccabachman" /> The teacher had researched the documentary, and wanted to teach his students the history of the word because of its frequent use in his class.<ref name="rebeccabachman" /> Anderson said it was not the use of the word "fuck" in the film that cost the teacher his job, but a 38-second scene from a ''[[Fuck for Forest]]'' concert in Europe where a couple engaged in sexual intercourse onstage as environmental advocacy.<ref name="rebeccabachman" /> The teacher showed the DVD to his 11th-grade journalism class at [[William Penn High School (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|William Penn High School]] without previewing it or sending [[permission slip]]s home to parents.<ref name="90minutelapse">{{cite news|first=Jill|last=Porter|title=The 90-minute lapse that killed a 19-year career: Showing a DVD about the F-Word in class was a mistake&nbsp;...
