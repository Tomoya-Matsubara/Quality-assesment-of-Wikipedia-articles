'''HMT ''Warwick Deeping'' (H136)''' was a [[naval trawler]] of the British [[Royal Naval Patrol Service]] during World War II, sunk off the [[Isle of Wight]] in December 1940.

==Ship history==
The ''Warwick Deeping'' was built in 1934 by [[Cochrane Shipbuilders|Cochrane & Sons Shipbuilders]] of [[Selby]] for the Newington Steam Trawling Company of [[Kingston upon Hull]] as a [[North Sea]] [[fishing trawler]]. 

She was acquired by the [[Admiralty]] in August 1939 and converted into an anti-submarine patrol vessel, armed with a single {{Convert|4|in|sing=on}} gun, machine guns, depth charges, and fitted with [[ASDIC]], and assigned to the 17th Anti-Submarine Group at [[Portsmouth]].

At 22:30 on the night of 10 October 1940 she was on patrol in the [[English Channel]], about {{Convert|10|nmi|lk=in}} south of the Isle of Wight, in company with HMT ''L'Istrac'' when she encountered five [[German torpedo boats of World War II|German torpedo boats]]; ''Falke'', ''Wolfe'', ''Greif'', ''Kondor'' and ''Seeadler''<ref name="wendes"/> which had sailed from [[Cherbourg]] to [[sortie]] along the English coast.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.naval-history.net/xDKWW2-4010-23OCT01.htm |title=Naval Events, October 1940 |first=Don |last=Kindell |work=British and Other Navies in World War 2 Day-by-Day |year=2010 |accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref> The two British ships soon found themselves under fire, and ''L'Istrac'', believing that the German ships were Royal Navy vessels [[Friendly fire|attacking in error]] switched on her identification lights. She was promptly shelled, causing a large explosion aboard, and then torpedoed and sunk, with the loss of her captain and 11 men.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hwtma.org.uk/hms-warwick-deeping-background |title=Background : HMS ''Warwick Deeping'' |work=The Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology |year=2012 |accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref> The ''Warwick Deeping'' attempted to escape, but was relentlessly attacked, and hit by a torpedo, which fortunately failed to explode. She was hit several times by shells, one of which finally disabled her engines. Now helpless and sinking, the crew abandoned the ship, but instead of delivering the ''[[coup de grace]]'' the German torpedo boats unexpectedly broke off their attack and sailed away. An hour later all 22 crew were rescued.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hulltrawler.net/Sidewinder/Vessel%20-%20W/WARWICK%20DEEPING%20H%20136.htm |title=''Warwick Deeping'' (H 136) |work=Hull Trawlers |year=2008 |accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref>

The ''Warwick Deeping'' lies in {{Convert|35|m}} of water at {{Coord|50|34.260|N|1|27.824|W|display=inline,title}} and is a popular [[wreck diving]] site.
