"'''Black Cat'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Janet Jackson]], released as the fifth single from her fourth studio album, ''[[Rhythm Nation 1814]]''. It was written solely by Jackson and produced by Jackson with [[Jellybean Johnson]]. In a departure from her standard of [[industrial music|industrial]]-based [[dance pop]], "Black Cat" is a [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] song. It also contains influences of [[punk (music)|punk]], [[dance-rock]], and [[hair metal]]. Its lyrics speak of [[substance abuse]] of the [[psychedelic drug]] [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|Acid]], in addition to [[gang violence]]. It was rumored to be composed about Jackson's ex-husband, recording artist [[James DeBarge]]. It was the final song recorded for the album, after Jackson composed its main riff when desiring a rock song to complete the record.

"Black Cat" was well received among critics, who praised Jackson's foray into the hard rock genre in addition to the song's "radical statement" towards drug abuse and violence. Jackson's vocals were also commended as used to their "maximum advantage." It reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart, making Jackson the first artist to simultaneously peak atop both charts. It also reached number three in South Africa, four in Canada, five in Norway, six in Australia, eleven in Ireland, fifteen in the United Kingdom, and number two in airplay in Japan and the World Chart, among other countries. It was certified [[Gold certification|gold]] in the United States and Australia.

Its [[music video]], directed by [[Wayne Isham]], was filmed during Jackson's [[Rhythm Nation World Tour]]. It used an "in-concert" theme, splicing Jackson with images of a [[black panther]]. Jackson performed "Black Cat" at the [[1990 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], in which she conveyed "feline" choreography and ripped open her shirt, exposing a black bra. The rendition's provocative nature lead to media controversy and became regarded as iconic within [[popular culture]], considered to usher in "a new age of sexual spontaneity." It was viewed as her first "shocking" performance due to Jackson having a [[virginity|virginal]] teenage image, in addition to the portrayal of female sexuality considered [[taboo]] at the time. The song's performance on the [[Rhythm Nation World Tour]] also drew media attention for its usage of [[illusionary magic]], concluding with Jackson forced into a cage before transformed into a live panther.

"Black Cat" received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female|Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]], making her the only artist in history to receive nominations spanning five genres. It won a [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] Pop Award for Most Played Song. Alternate versions featured [[Nuno Bettencourt]] of [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]] and [[Vernon Reid]] of [[Living Colour]], in addition to a live version with [[Dave Navarro]]. A version with [[Lemmy]] of [[Motorhead]] was also planned. "Black Cat" has been cited as an influence by artists such as [[Nicole Scherzinger]], [[Fefe Dobson]], [[Jessica Simpson]], and [[Alanis Morissette]]. Critics have observed it to inspire numerous pop artists attempting the rock genre, including [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Rihanna]]. It has been covered by [[Warmen]], [[Britney Spears]], and [[Nanne Gr<U+00F6>nvall]], and was also performed on ''[[The Voice of Germany (season 3)|The Voice of Germany]]'' and ''[[X Factor (Norwegian TV series)|X Factor Norway]]''. Jackson's performance on the [[MTV Video Music Awards]] has been emulated by several performers. It was later included in the multi-console game [[Band Hero]].

==Background==
"Black Cat" was written by Jackson and produced by Jackson with [[Jellybean Johnson]]. It was a departure from her prior hits, being her first sole writing credit and the first time she had worked with producers other than [[Jam & Lewis]] since the release of ''[[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]].'' The song was a stark contrast for Jackson, transitioning from her customary style of [[industrial (music)|industrial]]-based [[dance-pop]] to the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[hard rock]] genre. Jackson considered it a natural transition, having grown up listening to artists such as [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Def Leppard]], and [[M<U+00F6>tley Cr<U+00FC>e]].<ref name="Interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=eDaIXL6ovNo|title=The Bully! Pulpit Show Classics: Mark Joseph Interviews Janet Janet Jackson|work=Bully Pulpit Show|publisher=YouTube|date=1990|accessdate=20-04-14}}</ref> She previously attempted the [[pop-rock]] genre on "[[Come Give Your Love to Me]]," a single from her [[Janet Jackson (album)|self-titled debut album]]. Jackson stated, "I'm very proud of Black Cat, which is the first song I've ever written on my own, as well as co-produced."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PogDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60|title=Janet Jackson Turns Serious|work=[[Jet Magazine]]|publisher=Johnson, Robert E.|page=60|date=06-11-89|accessdate=20-04-14}}</ref> It became the last song recorded for the album, upon Jackson desiring a rock-influenced song to complete the record.<ref name="Billboard">{{cite news|title=Black Cat|work=The Billboard Book of Number One Hits|publisher=Bronson, Fred|page=770|accessdate=20-04-14}}</ref> Recording engineer [[Michael Wagener]] added, "Black Cat is a song she wrote all by herself on that album, and she wanted it to cross over into rock."<ref name="Wagener"/>

Jackson's idea for "Black Cat" was based on a warning to a rebel involved in [[substance abuse]], in addition to the consequences of drug addiction. Its composition compares the theme to the [[folklore]] [[superstition]]s of cats having nine lives and black cats foreshadowing a negative omen or misfortune. She also related its title to the bold nature of a panther, saying "I have always felt some kind of connection between myself and a panther. They're not afraid of anything, they're willing to take on anything<U+2013>that's the way I feel about my work."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=u68DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA40|title=Words of the Week|work=[[Jet Magazine]]|date=01-10-90|accessdate=20-04-14}}</ref> Regarding its development, she said, "I was getting dressed and ready to go to the studio. The television was on - some commercials and other stuff. I just started humming a melody. I don't know why and it kept sticking in my head. So I put it down on tape." She later recalled [[Jam & Lewis]] saying "they thought it was something that might work."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PogDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62|title=Janet Jackson Turns Serious|work=[[Jet Magazine]]|publisher=Johnson, Robert E.|page=62|date=06-11-89|accessdate=20-04-14}}</ref> Jackson was heavily involved in the song's production, stating:
{{cquote|"We were finished with the entire album and I came up with a guitar riff, and ran up to Jimmy and Terry and told them, 'Hey, we should do this.' They said, 'We have a deadline so we couldn't possibly go onto another song.' I told them, it's ok, I'll do it, just throw me in a studio and I'll put everything together... I wrote the riff and the lyrics, and actually the whole thing."<ref name="Interview"/>}}

===Recording===
After playing a piano riff and singing the melody for [[Jimmy Jam]], they recorded a rough vocal track. Jam stated, "She sang me the melody, and then asked "well, what do you think it needs?" I said, Nothing. Go write some lyrics, it's fine," adding, "She had a bunch of different melodies, so we picked the two melodies that worked best."<ref name="Billboard"/> Jam and Lewis chose to forego its production, deciding another producer should execute the song: "We stay away from things we can't do. It's not like, 'We've got to do this, and it's got to be our way.' We're going for the ''best'' way." Jam contacted [[Jellybean Johnson]] to develop the song with Jackson and help her produce it.<ref name="Billboard"/> Johnson recalled, "She first played the groove for me on piano... I thought it would be cool if I could make Janet sound like a heavy metal queen. I knew the rest of them thought I was out of my mind, but I got a friend to play the guitars. I put toms and cymbals on it. Terry played bass and some sparse keyboards, and it was there." In addition to Johnson, guitarist [[Dave Barry]] was asked to contribute after previously providing guitar on "You Can Be Mine" from Jackson's [[Control (Janet Jackson album)|prior album]]. Barry stated, "I wanted it to be authentic rock and roll. I rocked it out, then Janet and I got together to do the vocals. Janet is a very nice, warm person, and she was receptive to my ideas."<ref name="Billboard"/> Jackson sang the song in an alternate tone, quickly adjusting her vocals in a single take. Johnson described, "One night I told her I wanted her to sound like a rock and roll queen on it<U+2013>she usually uses one of her other voices .. this, you wanted to be funky, but more rocked out. She did it in one or two takes." Jam added, "I tried to get her to sing a couple of the other vocals in her natural [voice] with kind of an edge on it. She [initially] didn't like the way her voice sounded. But for Black Cat, that was exactly what was needed."<ref name="Billboard"/>

==Alternate versions==
In the album version of "Black Cat", the majority of the guitar riffs are played by [[Dave Barry]], including the introduction, main riff, and solo midsection. Barry subsequently became Jackson's touring guitarist and tour director. John McClain, former A&R executive for [[A&M Records]], provided the [[slide guitar]], while Jellybean Johnson also provided additional riffs. [[Jesse Johnson (musician)|Jesse Johnson]] provided a fading riff towards its finale and Terry Lewis played additional bass.

[[File:Extreme08 026.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Nuno Bettencourt]] provides guitar on the single version.]]Several remixes incorporate alternate production from various guitarists. The radio edit and "Video Mix" of "Black Cat" features [[Nuno Bettencourt]] of [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]] on additional [[rhythm guitar]]. An extended version with a longer guitar solo appeared on Jackson's ''[[Design of a Decade: 1986<U+2013>1996]]'' compilation, while an alternate version with a shortened solo is included on ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]''. It was mixed by German recording engineer [[Michael Wagener]], who had not previously worked with any pop acts and was approached due to Jackson's desire to "cross over into Hard Rock."<ref name="Wagener">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsludge.tv/?p=28846|title=20 Questions with Michael Wagener, 5/13/03|work=[[Metal Sludge]]|date=13-05-03|accessdate=20-04-14}}</ref> Upon collaborating, Bettencourt said Jackson was "sweet" and "beautiful," jokingly expressing his desire to marry her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://halen.com/evh/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=printview&t=691520&start=0|title=nuno bettencourt anybody?|work=Halen.com|date=12-04-09|accessdate=20-04-14}}</ref> In return for Bettencourt's contribution, Jackson was speculated to provide the spoken line "Did you say your prayers? Don't forget to put your tooth under the pillow" on the song "Money (in God We Trust)" from Extreme's sophomore album, ''[[Pornograffiti]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Nuno Bettencourt Network|work=[[Rate Your Music]]|accessdate=20-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ny/av1/facts.html|title=NUNO FACTS and INFO.|work=Nuno Page|accessdate=20-04-14}}</ref>

The "Guitar Mix" features [[Vernon Reid]] of [[Living Colour]]. Reid stated, "Black Cat" was one of my favorite tracks on ''[[Rhythm Nation 1814|Rhythm Nation]]''. I had the song and learned the parts, the structure of it, and just went in and did it. I think we used the second take. I just wanted to get into that arena thing. It's meant to sound really big."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/sunsetstrip/palladium/8797/interview004.html|title=Guitar for the Practicing Musician Interview|work=[[Guitar for the Practicing Musician]]|date=01-91|accessdate=20-04-14}}</ref> [[Jesse Johnson (musician)|Jesse Johnson]] provided a guitar solo which was not used for the album version, but is featured in each of its remixes. The remixes have the added component of live drumming performed by Derek Organ of [[Switch (band)|Switch]], showcasing more of a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] feel in the extended solo and double kick drums. Both versions omit the panther roar introduction and vocal refrain closing from the album edit.

[[Lemmy|Lemmy Kilmister]] of [[Motorhead]] intended to record a version of "Black Cat" with Jackson, but was prohibited. Lemmy stated, "I wanted to do a version of 'Black Cat' with her, but [[Sony Records|Sony]] wouldn't let me.

|filetype=[[Ogg]]}}
The song's lyrical composition warns of the consequences of [[substance abuse]], in addition to [[gang violence]]. It portrays the symptoms of battling drug addiction with Jackson acting as a "concerned lover," providing details for the general signs of the issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/15186/Janet-Jackson-Rhythm-Nation-1814/|title=Janet Jackson - Rhythm Nation 1814 (album review ) - Sputnikmusic|work=[[Sputnikmusic]]|publisher=Powell, Zachary|date=16-02-08|accessdate=17-09-89}}</ref> Jackson composed the song in the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] genre to display the aggressiveness of its theme, rumored to be written about her then-husband, recording artist [[James DeBarge]]. It opens with Jackson demonstrating the early signs of addication, such as breaking prior commitments of spending time with a loved one: "All the lonely nights I spend alone / Never around to love me / You're always gone." The following lines, "Breakin' the rules / Oh the man has come / Looking for you", depict police in search of the aforementioned man. It also refers to the drug dealer, knowing the addicted has a [[physical dependency]], though will continue selling drugs to them for profit regardless. The next lines, "You're a rebel now / Don't give a damn / Always carrying on / With the gang", portray the next stage of addiction, in which the addicted surrounds themselves with other enablers involved in the same lifestyle. Jackson warns him of the misstep, foreshadowing their potential death if they continue: "I'm trying to tell you boy / It's a mistake / You won't realize / Til it's too late." She attempts to be a voice of reason, talking sense into the addicted through musical intervention. The aforementioned man begins telling lies, showing signs of denial to avoid confrontation: "Don't understand / Why you insist / On ways of living such a dangerous life / Time after time you stay away / And I just know that you're telling me lies."<ref name="Meaning">{{cite web|url=http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/130572/|title=Janet Jackson - Black Cat Lyrics - SongMeanings|work=[[SongMeanings]]|accessdate=17-09-89}}</ref>

Its chorus includes two folklore superstitions, cats having nine lives and black cats representing misfortune. The lines "Black cat / Nine lives / Short days / Long nights / Living on the edge / Not afraid to die" are metaphoric for the addict only having several times to risk their lives before it comes to an end through drug usage or related violence. The "nine lives" also symbolize the prospect of being caught performing illegal activity, metaphorically losing a life and allowing "the man" to become closer to catching him each time. He develops a longing for experiencing the [[Epinephrine#Adrenaline junkie|adrenaline rush]] of escaping without being caught, following his own rules in a similar means to a stray black cat. The following lines, "Heart beat real strong / But not for long / Better watch your step or you're gonna die" echoes a similar sentiment of the man being someone whose proposed "lives" are quickly running out.<ref name="Meaning"/> In the adjacent verse, Jackson speaks of the great lengths addicts go to in order to satisfy their cravings, ranging from lying to illegal methods such as stealing: "You're so together boy / But just at a glance / You'll do anything / If given a chance." The man promises to change and refrain from using drugs but does not, also breaking promises to themselves: "Scheming, planning lies / To get what you need / So full of promises / That you never keep." The line also refers to the potential the man has that his addiction prohibits from being fulfilled.<ref name="Meaning"/>

In the finale verse, Jackson realizes the time invested in attempting to help the man has been ineffective, questioning why he continues to refute the problem: "Don't you tell yourself / That it's okay / Sick and tired of / All of your games." Meanwhile, she attempts to convince herself to leave the relationship before the addiction has a negative effect on her own life, while the addicted continues to use denial to disguise their dependency: "And you want me to stay / Better change / Makes no sense to me / Your crazy ways." The album version includes a brief prelude in which Jackson exclaims "Ain't no acid in this house," implying the song's theme of a man abusing the [[psychedelic drug]] [[Lysergic acid diethylamide]].<ref name="Meaning"/>

==Critical reception==
"Black Cat" received positive reception from critics, who placed heavy emphasis on Jackson's foray into [[hard rock]].

The [[music video]] for "Black Cat" was directed by [[Wayne Isham]]. It was filmed on April 5, 1990 using live concert footage from Jackson's [[Rhythm Nation World Tour]] at the [[Met Center]] in Bloomington, Minneapolis. In addition to the audience for the sold-out show, the filming reportedly drew an additional 3,000 fans.<ref name="Ones"/> The video premiered during the tour's first date at the [[Tacoma Dome]], projected on three screens prior to Jackson appearing on stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900607&slug=1075921|title=Dance Class -- Janet Jackson Conducts A Seminar On The Verb: To Move|work=[[Seattle Times]]|date=07-06-90|accessdate=20-04-14}}</ref> It was later debuted on MTV and other music channels in August. The video uses an "in concert" theme, in a similar concept to other [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] music videos of the era, being a departure from her heavily choreographed videos with various settings. Spliced footage of a black panther is shown throughout the video. Jackson explained, "Black panthers fascinate me. They've become an obsession. During filming, we used a black panther who actually attacked his trainer. Don't ask me why, but I was never fearful. I feel a strange rapport with panthers. They've become an inner symbol.

Jackson performed the song at the opening of the [[1990 MTV Video Music Awards]] as her debut performance on the ceremony. During the performance, the singer ripped open her top to expose a black bra underneath, and became highly controversial in the media for its provocative nature, considered to usher in "a new age of sexual spontaneity." It was viewed as the first "shocking" performance of her career due to Jackson having a [[Virginity|virginal]] teenage image, in addition to the portrayal of female sexuality considered [[taboo]] at the time.

{{Quote box
 |quote  = With this album, however, she broke record after record, including an astounding seven top five singles. "Black Cat" hit the hardest, a pure late-'80s hard-rock anthem wailed by one intense young woman. Interestingly, it was also the first single Jackson wrote by herself. Something about fame and fortune inspired a pretty heavy fucking track, and music-lovers (and strippers) have been thankful ever since.

In a "Chart Flashblack," ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated, "What is so amazing about Janet Jackson and the entire ''[[Rhythm Nation 1814]]'' album is that even the 92nd single off that record is still better than 80% of the crap on this list," adding "Most hair metal bands would have paid a lifetime in [[spandex]] to come up with that guitar line."<ref name="EW"/> Film journal ''Reverse Shot'' called it "the ''[[Le Sacre du Printemps]]'' of 1989."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reverseshot.com/legacy/septoct03/freddyvjason.html|title=reverse shot : online : reviews|work=Pinkerton, Nick|publisher=Reverse Shot|accessdate=20-04-14}}</ref> The song's music video was thought to cause a "butt revolution" and increase the desire for a woman's rear posterior within popular culture.<ref name="Butt"/> Jackson's performance of "Black Cat" at the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], in which she ripped open her blouse, was considered to usher in "a new age of sexual spontaneity on live television," also regarded as her "first shocking public statement."<ref name="Answers.com"/>
