The [[United States Air Force]]'s '''1st Space Launch Squadron''' ('''1 SLS''')<ref>Rogers, B. (2006). United States Air Force Unit Designations Since 1978. ISBN 1-85780-197-0</ref> was a space launch unit located at [[Patrick AFB]], [[Florida]]. It was responsible for USAF [[Delta II]] launches from its activation in October 1990 to its inactivation in August 2009.

==History==
Air Force launch operations were transferred from [[Air Force Systems Command]] to [[Air Force Space Command]] in the early 1990s.  Phase I of the Launch Transfer Plan began on 1 October 1990, with the elimination of the Eastern and Western Space and Missile Centers, and the creation of the [[30th Space Wing]] and the [[45th Space Wing]].<ref>[http://www.patrick.af.mil/heritage/Cape/Capefram.htm The Cape: Military Space Operations 1971-1992]</ref> 

The 1st SLS was activated on 1 October 1990 and became [[Air Force Space Command]]'s first Delta II launch squadron.<ref>World Airpower Journal. (1992). US Air Force Air Power Directory.  Aerospace Publishing: London, UK. ISBN 1-880588-01-3</ref> It was inactivated on 18 August 2009, following the final USAF launch of a Delta II which had occurred the previous day. Its final launch successfully placed the [[USA-206]], or GPS IIR-21(M) [[navigation satellite]] into orbit.<ref name="SFN-D343">{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/delta/d343/|title=Bittersweet launch ends several chapters of history|last=Ray|first=Justin|date=2009-08-17|publisher=Spaceflight Now|accessdate=2009-08-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090915231220/http://www.spaceflightnow.com/delta/d343/| archivedate= 15 September 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
