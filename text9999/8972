'''''Forceful''''' was an ocean going [[tugboat]] built for the Queensland Tug Company. While she spent most of her career in civilan service operating along the coast of [[Queensland]] from her home port of [[Brisbane]], she was commissioned into the [[Royal Australian Navy]] during most of 1942 and 1943 as '''HMAS ''Forceful'''''. During her war service she was based at [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] and operated mainly in [[northern Australia|northern Australian]] waters. ''Forceful'' was retired from service in September 1970 and was handed over to the [[Queensland Maritime Museum]] in [[Brisbane]] on [[10 June]] [[1970]]. She has been maintained in operating condition and makes frequent trips along the [[Brisbane River]] and [[Moreton Bay]].
