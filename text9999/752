'''Margaret Jewett Smith Bailey''' (1812?<U+2013>1882) was an American pioneer, missionary, and author from [[Oregon]].<ref name=OE>{{Oregon Encyclopedia|bailey_margaret_jewett_smith_1812_1882_|Margaret Jewett Smith Bailey|author=Ward, Jean M}}</ref>

Bailey, using the pen name '''Ruth Rover''', wrote one of the earliest literary works published in Oregon, ''The Grains, or, Passages in the Life of Ruth Rover, with Occasional Pictures of Oregon, Natural and Moral''.<ref name=OE/> According to historian Edwin Bingham in the foreword to the 1986 edition, ''Grains'' is "part autobiography, part religious testimonial, part history and travelogue", but "by stretching the definition, ''The Grains'' may be called a [[novel]], the first novel written and published on the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific coast]]."<ref name=OE/>{{sfn|Bailey|1986|p=v}}

==Early life==
Margaret Jewett Smith was born in [[Saugus, Massachusetts]] in about 1812. She converted to [[Methodism]] when she was 17 at a [[camp meeting]].{{sfn|Bailey|1986|p=7}} She attended the Methodist Episcopal [[Wilbraham Wesleyan Academy|Wesleyan Academy]] in [[Wilbraham, Massachusetts|Wilbraham]] over the objections of her family, especially her father, who wished for her to care for him in his old age and who threatened to disown her.{{sfn|Bailey|1986|p=7}} She hoped she could become a [[missionary]] teacher among the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].{{sfn|Bailey|1986|p=7}}

==Move to Oregon Country==
Smith came to the [[Oregon Country]] to join the [[Methodist Mission]] in September 1837 with the Reverend [[David Leslie (Oregon politician)|David Leslie]], his wife Mary, their children, and the Reverend H. K. W. Perkins.{{sfn|Bailey|1986|p=4}}<ref name=PSU>{{cite web |url= http://woh.pdx.edu/heroine/2893 |publisher= [[Portland State University]] |title= Margaret Jewett Bailey}}</ref> Smith, who worked as a teacher, was the only unmarried white woman at the mission, thus the mission authorities pressured her to marry.<ref name=OE/> She was courted by [[William H. Willson]] and was engaged to him for a time, but she refused to marry him after learning he had also written to another woman, Chloe Clark, asking her to come to Oregon to become his wife.{{sfn|Bailey|1986|p=7}} Smith insisted on waiting to marry Willson until it was known if the other woman was coming to Oregon.{{sfn|Bailey|1986|p=7}} Willson became impatient and asked Smith to falsely confess that they had [[fornication|fornicated]] so that they would be allowed to marry immediately.{{sfn|Bailey|1986|p=7}} Smith refused, but Willson told the other members of the mission that they had sinned together.{{sfn|Bailey|1986|p=7}} Smith, unable to prove her innocence, left the mission.{{sfn|Bailey|1986|p=7}}

In 1839, Smith married [[William J. Bailey]], an early pioneer and later politician who did not belong to the mission.<ref name=OE/><ref name=PSU/> Willson married [[Chloe Clark Willson|Chloe Aurelia Clark]] the following year.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.salemhistory.net/people/chloe_willson.htm |title= Chloe Clark Willson |publisher= Salem Online History |last= Green |first= Virginia  |coauthor= Katherine Wallig |accessdate= March 23, 2014}}</ref> Smith lived with Bailey on their farm in [[French Prairie]] and became a regular contributor of prose and poetry to the ''[[Oregon Spectator]]'' beginning in 1846.<ref name=OE/><ref name=PSU/> On April 12, 1854, Margaret divorced William because of his drinking and abuse.{{sfn|Bailey|1986|p=8}}

==''The Grains''==
In order to tell her side of the story about her association with the Methodist mission and her divorce from William Bailey,  Margaret Bailey wrote ''The Grains'' in an attempt to clear her name.<ref name=Ward>{{cite book |title=Pacific Northwest Women 1815-1925: Lives, Memories and Writings |editor1= Ward, Jean M. |editor2= Maveety, Elaine A. |publisher= Oregon State University Press |year= 1995 |page= 193}}</ref> According to Bailey, as she writes in the first chapter of ''Grains'', "I am avoided and shunned, and slighted, and regarded with suspicions in every place till my life is more burdensome than death would be."<ref name=Ward/>

''The Grains'' was intended to be published in monthly installments, but only two volumes were issued, in August and September 1854 by Carter & Austin in [[Portland, Oregon]].<ref name=OCHC>{{cite web |url= http://www.ochcom.org/pdf/Bailey-MJ.pdf |publisher= [[Oregon Cultural Heritage Commission]] |title= Margaret Jewett Bailey aka Ruth Rover |last= Weber |first= Marsha}}</ref><ref name=Nelson>{{cite journal |url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20611546?uid=3739856&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21103827453353 |title= First True Confession Story Pictures Oregon 'Moral' |journal= [[Oregon Historical Quarterly]] |last=Nelson |first= Herbert B. |volume= 45 |number=2 |date=June 1944 |pages=168<U+2013>176}}</ref> Bailey was already known to some Oregon readers by the time ''The Grains'' was published because of her work in the ''Spectator'' (signed "MJB"), and her letters home that were printed in Boston and New York-based Christian newspapers as early as 1838.<ref name=OE/>{{sfn|Bailey|1986|p=9}} Bailey became the first local poet to be published west of the [[Rocky Mountains]] when her poem "Love" appeared in the first issue of the ''Spectator'' on February 5, 1846.{{sfn|Bailey|1986|p=9}} After her divorce, Bailey edited six columns of the "Ladies Department" for the ''Spectator'' from May to  June 1854.{{sfn|Bailey|1986|p=10}} In her first column, Bailey expressed her desire to publish a paper exclusively for women.{{sfn|Bailey|1986|p=10}} She did not publish any writing after ''Grains'', however.<ref name=OE/>

''The Grains'', published two years before [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', is like that work a social protest, which criticizes [[Jason Lee (missionary)|Jason Lee]] and the mission community, as well as the mission's failure to [[Conversion to Christianity|convert]] the local Native Americans, and discrimination against women.<ref name=Speak>{{cite book |title=From Here We Speak: An Anthology of Oregon Poetry |series= Oregon Literature Series |year=1993 |publisher= Oregon State University Press |editor1= St. John, Primus |editor2=Wendt, Ingrid |page=38}}</ref> According to the editors of the 1986 edition, Bailey's account of the facts of her life with the mission is accurate, although her interpretation of the events was sometimes biased.{{sfn|Bailey|1986|p=9}} For example, she attributed the many misfortunes that befell David Leslie and his family (fires, the death of his wife and several children, illnesses) to [[divine retribution]] for his ill treatment of her.{{sfn|Bailey|1986|p=9}} Per the editors of the 1986 reprint of the novel, although the heroine of the book is named "Ruth Rover", "there seems to have been no doubt in anyone's mind at the time of its publication that this book was a thinly disguised autobiography of Margaret Jewett (Smith) Bailey".{{sfn|Bailey|1986|p=6}} The book drew on letters and her diary and journal entries, but she disguised the names of many of the principal characters (Willson becomes "Wiley", Leslie becomes "Leland", and Bailey becomes "Binney".){{sfn|Bailey|1986|pages=6-9}}<ref name=Sorrow>{{cite journal |url= http://www.jstor.org/stable/40487377 |title= Ruth Rover's Cup of Sorrow |last= Nelson |first= Herbert B. |journal= [[Pacific Northwest Quarterly]] |volume= 50 |number= 3 |date=July 1959 |pages= 91<U+2013>98 |publisher= [[University of Washington]]}}</ref>

At the time of its release, Bailey's book received poor reviews and according to some scholars, most of the copies were destroyed.<ref name=Thomas>{{cite journal |url= http://archives.gcah.org/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10516/6110/MH-1996-October-Thomas.pdf?sequence=1 |journal= Methodist History |volume= 35 |issue=1 |date=October 1996 |title= Against the Grains: Margaret Jewett Bailey's Social and Spiritual Independence, Oregon, 1837-1854 |last=Thomas |first= David C.}}</ref> Most of the criticism of Bailey's work was due to her being a woman and a divorcee.<ref name=Place>{{cite web |url= http://www.ohs.org/the-oregon-history-project/narratives/this-land-oregon/education-arts-letters/person-place-wedded-together.cfm |title= Person and Place Wedded Together |publisher= Oregon Historical Society |accessdate= March 23, 2014}}</ref>

''The Grains'', which was considered a "lost" work, was republished in a single volume by the [[Oregon State University Press]] in 1986 and was produced by combining the last three known copies in existence with a separately published story.<ref name=Bulletin>{{cite news |url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&dat=19860501&id=965TAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7oYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5608,3500441 |title= Rare Oregon Novel Considered Lost: New 'Grains' Edition Out |author= OSU Extension Service |date= May 1, 1986 |newspaper= [[The Bulletin (Bend)|The Bulletin]]}}</ref>

A review of the 1986 edition notes that as a [[primary source]], the book is a "fascinating (if seamy) insight into the workings of both daily life and internecine warfare at the '[[Oregon Mission]]'".<ref name=Cogan>{{cite journal |url= http://www.jstor.org/stable/20614165 |title= Book Reviews |section= The Grains; Or Passages in the Life of Ruth Rover, with Occasional Pictures of Oregon, Natural and Moral by Margaret Jewett Bailey; Evelyn Leasher; Robert J. Frank |last= Cogan |first= Frances B. |journal= Oregon Historical Quarterly |volume= 89 |number= 1 |date= Spring 1988 |pages= 92<U+2013>94}}</ref> The reviewer thinks the book is less successful as a [[Domestic realism|domestic novel]] such as those written by contemporaries [[Susan Warner]] and [[Mary Jane Holmes]].<ref name=Cogan/>

==Later life==
Bailey married Francis Waddle in [[Polk County, Oregon|Polk County]] in 1855 and they divorced in 1858.<ref name=OE/> Bailey later moved to the [[Washington Territory]] and married a man named Crane.<ref name=OE/> Bailey died in poverty in [[Seattle]] on May 17, 1882, as Margaret J. Crane.<ref name=OE/><ref name=Speak/>

==Other early Northwest works==
Although Bailey's ''Grains'' is considered by many scholars to be the first novel published in Oregon, and she is the first Oregon woman writer to appear in print, several other early works are often mentioned as part of the literary foundation of what became the [[Northwestern United States]].{{sfn|Bailey|1986|p=v}}<ref name=Place/> In March 1838, [[Anna Maria Pittman Lee]] wrote the first poem in Oregon, a farewell to her husband Jason Lee. In 1843, the novel ''Prairie Flower'' was written by [[Sidney Walter Moss]], and was probably the first novel written in Oregon. Moss, who was from [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]], sent the manuscript with a friend to the east coast where it was published by Stratton & Barnard in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]] under the name [[Emerson Bennett]], a well-known author of the time. In 1852, the satiric political play "Treason, Stratagems, and Spoils, A [[Melodrame]] in Five Acts by Breakspear" ([[Charles Lysander Adams]]) was published in five installments in ''[[The Oregonian]]'' and appeared later as a pamphlet.{{sfn|Bailey|1986|p=v}}<ref name=Timeline>{{cite web |url= http://www.ochcom.org/oregonliterarytimeline.html |title= A Working Chronology of Oregon Literature 1838-1950 |publisher= Oregon Cultural Heritage Commission |accessdate= March 23, 2014}}</ref> [[James G. Swan]]'s ''The Northwest Coast, or, Three Years' Residence in Washington Territory'' was published in 1856.{{sfn|Bailey|1986|p=v}}
