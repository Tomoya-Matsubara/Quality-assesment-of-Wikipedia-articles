"'''Vow'''" is a song by [[alternative rock]] band [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]]. It was released by [[A&E Records#Mushroom Records UK|Mushroom Records UK]] and [[Almo Sounds]] as their debut single in 1995, having been written and recorded one year earlier. The song started as a [[Demo (music)|demo]] during sessions between band members [[Butch Vig]], [[Duke Erikson]] and [[Steve Marker]], and had its composition finished after singer [[Shirley Manson]] joined the band. The lyrics deal with themes of revenge and retaliation, and were inspired by a newspaper article on [[domestic abuse]].

"Vow" first appeared on a ''[[Volume magazine|Volume]]'' CD sampler at the end of 1994. The song was subsequently picked up and broadcast by [[BBC Radio 1]] [[Disc jockey|DJ]]s [[Steve Lamacq]] and [[John Peel]], and playlisted by [[modern rock]] radio stations in Los Angeles and Seattle. "Vow" generated such significant buzz through positive reviews and [[word-of-mouth]] that it was eventually chosen as Garbage's first single release. After a low-key [[independent record label]] pressing in the [[United Kingdom]], where it was packaged in a very [[limited edition]] logo [[Embossing (manufacturing)|embossed]] aluminium case, "Vow" went on to top the alternative charts in [[Australia]] and reached the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in the [[United States]].

==Development and composition==
"Vow" began in rough [[Demo (music)|demo]] form in January, 1994, as band members [[Butch Vig]], [[Duke Erikson]] and [[Steve Marker]] performed sessions in Marker's basement [[recording studio]] and Vig and Marker's own [[Smart Studios]] business in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].<ref name=qmag>{{cite journal|last=Malins|first=Steve|title=What's Our Problem?|journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|location=Detroit, Michigan|pages=50<U+2013>53|date=1996-09-01}}</ref> After Marker saw [[Shirley Manson]]'s group [[Angelfish (band)|Angelfish]] on ''[[120 Minutes]]'', the band invited Manson to Smart Studios to sing on a couple of tracks. After a dreadful first audition, she returned to Angelfish, which folded shortly thereafter.<ref name="behindthemusic">"''Garbage: [[Behind The Music]]'', [[VH1]], aired March 31, 2002"</ref> Manson decided to test for Garbage again, and after the successful second audition, she began to work on the then-skeletal "[[Queer (Garbage song)|Queer]]" and "Vow". While performing "Vow", Manson [[ad-lib]]bed the lyrics "I can't use what I can't abuse" and "like [[Joan of Arc]] coming back for more".<ref name=mmaker>{{cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Dave|title=Modern Life is Rubbish|journal=[[Melody Maker]]|location=UK|pages=42<U+2013>43|date=1995-03-18}}</ref> The song is written in the key of [[G minor]], set in [[time signature]] of common time with a [[tempo]] of 126 [[Tempo|beats per minute]].<ref name="sheet"/> It opens with Erikson playing a guitar through a [[noise gate]] "with a lot of echo on it",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/rock/e4/garbageint.html|title=ROCK N ROLL EXPERIENCE - Garbage Interview!|date=2002-04-29|publisher=Rock N Roll Experience|accessdate=2011-11-30}}</ref> and has a [[chord progression]] is A<U+2013>C-F in the verses,  D-D-B<U+266D>-A-A-Em-D5-B<U+266D>-G in the bridge, and C-D-G-F in the chorus.<ref name="sheet">{{cite web|title=Garbage <U+2013> Vow <U+2013> Digital Sheet Music|publisher=Musicnotes.com.

According to Vig, the inspiration for the song was a newspaper article about a woman who had gone back to get revenge on an [[domestic abuse|abusive husband]], "so we thought it would be cool to get a bit of retribution in there."<ref name="volume">{{cite web | url=http://www.cafemomo.com/inprint/9411volume.shtml | title=The First UK Interview | date=1994-11-01 | work=Volume | accessdate=2008-02-05 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19991014042851/www.cafemomo.com/inprint/9411volume.shtml |archivedate=1999-10-14}}</ref> Vig also said he noted violence could also come from psychological stand point by seeing the story of a [[sado-masochistic]] couple who could not keep away from each other.<ref name=mmaker/> Lyrically, Manson claimed "'Vow' is about having feelings [of vengeance]. You have to face your feelings of revenge and work out why you feel that way. It's about that conundrum when you're really angry but in reality you're in a pitiful state. Angry, twisted, but deep down, vulnerable."<ref name=Dustbin>{{cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Dave|title=Vig's Atomic Dustbin|journal=[[Melody Maker]]|location=UK|date=1995-08-12}}</ref> During promotion for the song, Garbage joked to journalists that "Vow" was about [[John and Lorena Bobbitt]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090413122252/http://www.garbage.net/garbage/articles/@dock.htm |title=Butch Vig: In The Dock|journal=RAW magazine|accessdate=2008-02-05}}</ref> 

Garbage had not initially planned to release "Vow" as their first single, as a single at all, or even include it on their [[Garbage (album)|debut album]].<ref name="musician">{{cite journal|title=Sounds Like Garbage|journal=[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]''|date=1996-01-01|first=Jim|last=Berkenstadt}}</ref> The band felt that "Vow" was not representative of the album's [[Crossover (music)#Crossover as a mix of genres|genre-hopping]] body of work, although they later came to appreciate the situation that led to the song becoming their debut. Manson declared that "now we can do whatever and people won't know what to expect", but if the band had instead settled for "of the more clubby tunes" as a single, "we would have been pigeonholed as a [[Alternative dance|dance band]] and that's a hard tag to shake".<ref name=Rise/>

==Single release==
===United Kingdom===
[[File:GarbageVowMetalSleeve.jpg|thumb|right|Mushroom Records issued the "Vow" [[7" vinyl]] single in a limited edition metal box, which sold out in one day and became a highly sought collectible.|alt=A metal box with an stylized G carved on it. A tag on the lower right corner features the record's information.]]
Midway through the recording sessions for the band's debut album, the band's label, [[Mushroom Records (UK)|Mushroom Records]], secured the group an inclusion on ''Volume'', a magazine that released [[compilation album]]s. However, the deadline given for accepting a track was only three days. The only song the band had completed in any shape or form was "Vow".<ref name=Rise>{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|title=Garbage Rise From The House That Grunge Built|url=http://www.garbage.net/garbage/articles/@rise.htm|publisher=Addicted to Noise|accessdate=2011-07-20|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/200012081244/http://www.garbage.net/articles/@rise.htm|archivedate=2000-12-08|year=1995}}</ref> After ''Volume'' was released in December 1994, "Vow" began to receive radio airplay from [[BBC Radio 1]] DJs [[Steve Lamacq]], [[John Peel]] and [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]],<ref name=rubbish>{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Simon|title=On a Rubbish Tip|date=1995-05-01|journal=NME|location=London|url=http://garbage.net/garbage/articles/@rub.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021218065109/http://www.garbage.net/garbage/articles/@rub.htm|archivedate=2002-12-18}}</ref> and record stores in the United Kingdom began to receive requests for a single that did not yet exist. Word-of-mouth on "Vow" took the track back to the United States, where [[KROQ-FM]] in Los Angeles and [[KNDD]] in Seattle discovered the song, and put it into rotation on their station playlists.<ref name=Serendipitous/> By May 1995, [[alternative radio]] stations across the country had picked up on "Vow", and it began to receive heavy rotation nationwide.<ref name="Garbage-almopromo"/> Garbage were still putting the finishing touches to their debut set, which was still three months away from release.<ref name=Serendipitous/>

On the back of the surprise attention that "Vow" had garnered, the band's UK [[record label]] [[A&E Records|Mushroom]] were keen to capitalise on the song. The terms of the licensing deal regarding the inclusion of "Vow" on ''Volume'' meant that the track could only be released on a limited basis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Finlay|first=Leo|title=Talent; Garbage|journal=[[Music Week]]|date=1995-09-30}}</ref> Concerned that at the time that their label was only known in the UK for the ''[[Neighbours]]'' theme tune,<ref name="recordcollector">{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Andy|title=Three Men and A Babe; Welcome to Spooner Town; Goodbye Angelfish|year=1997|journal=Record Collector|location=London|edition=#209}}</ref> Mushroom founded the Discordant label for the sole purpose of launching Garbage.<ref name="OHWIRsell-in">{{cite web|title="Only Happy When It Rains" press release|url=http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y296/boylikearose/Garbage%20Memorabilia/1995OnlyHappyWhenItRainspresssheet.jpg|publisher=Mushroom Records|accessdate=2011-07-16}}</ref> Prior to its release "Vow" had already topped ''[[NME]]'''s playlist chart for 5 weeks<ref name="garbagepr">{{cite press release|title=Garbage Press Release (page 1 of 5)|year=1995|publisher=Mushroom Records|location=London, UK|url=http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y296/boylikearose/Garbage%20Memorabilia/1995Garbagepressreleasepage1.jpg}}</ref> and received "Single of the Week" status in seven publications.<ref name="Garbage-almopromo">"''Garbage'' advance [[Almo Sounds]] promo disc sleeve notes"</ref> 

On March 20, 1995 "Vow" was issued in a [[limited edition]] [[7" vinyl]] format, [[b-side|backed with]] a [[remix]] of the title track and packaged in an [[Embossing (manufacturing)|embossed]] aluminium sleeve. A total of 1,000 copies were pressed, of which only 934 were made available to buy, barely enough to reach the U.K. [[UK Singles chart|Top 100]]. "Vow" sold out in one day.<ref name="recordcollector"/> The single was the first of six specially packaged Garbage singles Mushroom Records released between 1995 and 1996, which were costly - making a 70p per unit loss on each single - but had the investment paid off as each subsequent single became bigger hits. The limited pressing helped the "Vow" single to become a highly sought collectible, with copies selling for <U+00A3>100 by the time Mushroom launched follow-up single "[[Subhuman (Garbage song)|Subhuman]]".<ref name=RecordCollector2>{{cite journal|title=Material Matters, The Problems of Packaging; Subhuman|pages=56<U+2013>57|year=1997|journal=Record Collector|location=London|edition=#209|first=Richard|last=Connell}}</ref>

In 1996, when the band's third North American single "[[Only Happy When it Rains]]" had driven the sales of ''Garbage'' into the top half of the [[Billboard 200]] for the first time, Almo Sounds considered re-releasing "Vow", feeling that on its initial release the song had not gotten a full chance at radio and video.
