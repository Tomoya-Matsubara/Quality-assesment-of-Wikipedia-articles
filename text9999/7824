{{nihongo|'''The Piass'''|<U+5983><U+963F><U+7526>|piasu}} are a Japanese [[Visual Kei]] band who formed around [[1993]] in [[Sapporo]], the current incarnation of the band features only one original member; Takayuki.

==History==  	 		
The group recorded their debut album in [[1995]] called "''Ryouki Kousatsu Chissoku-Shi''", the band consisted of Chihiro (Vocals), Takayuki (Guitar), Yoshio (Bass) and Hiroshi (Drums), this album was done in a melodic [[Hard Rock]] style with lyrics by Chihiro and even featured a cover of a [[Hanoi Rocks]] song; Dead By Xmas. 	 

Tragically on [[October 25]], [[1995]], while shooting a promotional video; Chihiro and Hiroshi died in an incident which included the two of them allegedly jumping off a bridge into a river, it is debated whether this was an [[accident]] or [[suicide]]. In [[1997]], Yoshio committed suicide, leaving Takayuki as the sole living member.	 
	 
In [[1998]], the only remaining member from the original carnation, Takayuki re-created the group appointing vocalist Kirala, who previously performed in the band Slum Junkie, bassist Ruiji from the band Mazohysteria and drummer Shizuki. 	 

The Piass released their second album, a self-titled effort which would prove to be a huge departure from their original sound, the group now had a frantic [[punk rock]] sound apposed to the more hard rock sound of the previous album. An E.P. would be recorded the following year called "''Gekka Kyoushou''". Their latest release was a single in [[2001]] called "''Aki Ryuusa ~Akina Zuna''".

==Current status==
[[2002]] saw vocalist Kirala departing The Piass, they now remain as a three piece band with Takayuki handling both vocal and guitar duties. Although the group hasn't released music for a while, they are still active, touring as recent as [[2005]].

The Piass have also released a collaboration with the band RA's TeSTARS, entitled "Color." It includes four tracks.

On May 24, 2006, the Piass released their newest album, ''Kansensho Paranoia''.  This is a great step forward for the band, as it is their very first release as The Piass since the departure of ex-vocalist Kirala.  ''Kansensho Paranoia'' consists of three all new tracks and a bonus DVD with a PV for the song "Shitakiri Suzume".  It is a limited issue CD.

On March 5, 2007, bassist Ruiji and drummer Shizuki have left the band. Vocalist Takayuki continues to stay with the band for lives using support members.
