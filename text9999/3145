'''Marcus LeMarr Allen''' (born March 26, 1960 in [[San Diego, California]]) is a former [[American football]] player, and until recently affiliated with [[CBS]] as a game analyst. As a professional, Allen ran for 12,243 yards and caught 587 passes for 5,411 yards during his career for both the [[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]] and the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] from 1982 to 1997. He scored 145 [[touchdowns]] including a then league record 123 rushing touchdowns and was elected to six [[Pro Bowl]]s when he retired.  He was also a fairly good passer for a running back, completing 12 of 27 passes for 285 yards and 6 touchdowns, with only 1 interception.  Allen was the first player ever to gain more than 10,000 rushing yards and 5,000 receiving yards during his career.

Allen is considered as one of the greatest goal line and short-yardage runners in [[National Football League]] history.<ref name="greatest">{{cite web |title=Pro Football Hall of Fame |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?player_id=15 |work=Pro Football Hall of Fame |publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame |accessdate=May 11, 2009}}</ref> He was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 2000 and the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 2003.

Allen played running back at the [[University of Southern California]] from 1978 to 1981.<ref name="greatath"/> He was recruited as a defensive back, but Head Coach [[John Robinson (coach)|John Robinson]] switched him to tailback.<ref name="greatath"/>  He spent his first season at USC as a backup to [[Heisman Trophy]] winning running back [[Charles White (American football)|Charles White]]. In 1979, he was moved to fullback.<ref name="greatath"/>  In 1980, he became a starter at tailback and rushed for 1,563 yards, the second most in the nation that year. Then in 1981, Allen had one of the most spectacular seasons in NCAA history. He rushed for 2,342 yards, becoming the first player in NCAA history to rush for over 2,000 yards in one season.<ref name="greatath"/> He also gained a total of 2,683 offensive yards, led the nation in scoring, and won the [[Heisman Trophy]],<ref name="greatath"/> the [[Maxwell Award]],<ref name="greatath"/> and [[Walter Camp Award]] and was also the Pac-10 player of the year.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}  Allen shares the NCAA record for most 200-yard rushing games with [[Ricky Williams]] and [[Ron Dayne]] at twelve games. 

USC has retired his jersey number (#33), and coach [[John Robinson (coach)|John Robinson]] called Allen "The greatest player I ever saw".<ref name="greatestplayer">{{cite web |title=College Football Hall of Fame |url=http://collegefootball.org/famersearch.php?id=80030 |work=National Football Foundation's College Football Hall of Fame |accessdate=May 11, 2009}}</ref>

==NFL career==
Allen was drafted as the tenth overall pick on the first round of the [[1982 NFL Draft]] by the [[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]].<ref name="greatath"/> In his rookie season in [[1982 NFL season|1982]], he rushed for 697 yards as he led the Raiders to the best record in the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] with a strike-shortened 8-1 record and was elected as [[NFL Rookie of the Year Award|NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year]].<ref name="greatath"/> The Raiders would lose to the [[New York Jets]] in the AFC Divisional Playoffs.

The next season, Marcus rushed for over 1,000 yards for the first time; he would do so again in [[1984 NFL season|1984]] and [[1985 NFL season|1985]].<ref name="greatath"/> That season, he rushed for 1,759 yards and scored 11 touchdowns on 380 carries as he led the Raiders to a 12-4 record and the AFC West Title and was named the NFL MVP.<ref name="greatath"/> During that time, he also caught 60 or more receptions for 3 years running (1983-85).<ref name="greatath"/>

Allen is best remembered for his heroics in [[Super Bowl XVIII]]. He ran for 191 yards, caught 2 passes for 18 yards, and scored 2 touchdowns in the Raiders 38-9 victory over the [[Washington Redskins]].<ref name="greatath"/> This included a 74-yard touchdown run,<ref name="greatath"/> a record that was the longest run in [[Super Bowl]] history, until [[Super Bowl XL]] when it was broken by [[Willie Parker]], by a single yard. His 191 rushing yards were also a Super Bowl record, which stood until [[Timmy Smith]] of the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] topped it with 204 yards in [[Super Bowl XXII]]. After the game he would join an elite group of players to win the Heisman Trophy and Super Bowl MVP (Roger Staubach, Jim Plunkett, Desmond Howard).  Moreover, Allen put together one of the greatest postseasons by a NFL running back.  On January 1, 1984 Allen put up 13 carried for 121 yards and 2 touchdowns against the Pittsburgh Steelers.  One week later, Allen rushed 25 times for 154 yards and scored 1 time on a reception.  In the Super Bowl Allen added 191 more rushing yards to his playoff totals.  In total, Allen rushed 58 times for 466 yards and 4 touchdowns.  He also added 118 yards and 1 touchdown on 14 receptions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Marcus Allen Game Logs |url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/AlleMa00_playoffs.htm |work=Pro-Football-Reference.com |publisher=Sports Reference |accessdate=May 11, 2009}}</ref>

A stormy relationship with [[Al Davis]] developed, stemming from a contract dispute where Davis referred to Allen as a cancer to the team.<ref name="contract">{{cite web |first=Nancy |last=Gay |title=Raiders Notebook: Classy Allen has the last word on his day |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/08/04/SP304723.DTL |work=SFGate |publisher=Hearst Communications |date=August 4, 2003 |accessdate=May 11, 2009}}</ref> He also missed most of the [[1989 NFL season|1989]] season with a knee injury.  Allen ended up relegated to back up duty in his final three seasons with the Raiders.  At one time, falling to fourth on the depth chart.<ref name="backup">{{cite web |title=Allen relegated to back up duty |url=http://www.football.com/nfl/oaklandraiders/history.html |work=Football.com |publisher=Football.com |accessdate=August 19, 2008}}{{Dead link|date=May 2009}}</ref>  Allen's strained relationship with Al Davis reached an all time low in December 1992.  During halftime of the Raiders-Dolphins game on Monday Night Football, a taped interview with Al Michaels was broadcast with Allen stating that Davis "told me he was going to get me." 

Allen further stated "I think he's (Davis) tried to ruin the latter part of my career, tried to devalue me.  He's trying to stop me from going to the Hall of Fame. They don't want me to play."<ref name="mondaynightfootball">{{cite web |title=Pro Football: Raiders' Allen Irked at Davis |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/15/sports/pro-football-raiders-allen-irked-at-davis.html |work=The New York Times |date=December 15, 1992 |accessdate=May 11, 2009}}</ref>

He left Los Angeles to join the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] in [[1993 NFL season|1993]], that year he rushed for only 764 yards, but scored 12 touchdowns<ref name="greatath"/> leading the AFC,<ref name="leading">{{cite web |title=Marcus Allen |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/allenmar.shtml |work=HickokSports.com |publisher=Ralph Hickok |date=February 18, 2009 |accessdate=May 11, 2009}}</ref> as he and [[Joe Montana]] led the Chiefs to the AFC Championship Game and was named the [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year]] that season. Allen went on to play for the Chiefs for four more seasons, leading the team in rushing every year but his last. Allen's main contribution to the Chiefs was his leadership abilities. The Chiefs won more games than any other NFL team during his tenure in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. Allen made many contributions to charitable causes off the field in Kansas City. He also hosted his own talk show on Sunday mornings before Chiefs games. Allen retired after [[1997 NFL season|1997]] season.<ref name="greatath"/>  In 1999, he was ranked number 72 on ''[[The Sporting News]]''' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. Marcus is inducted in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] as an Oakland Raider.

In August 2005, Allen and [[CBS Sports]] parted ways. The network began to diminish Allen's role over the last few years. Allen currently works for the [[NFL Network]] and he contributes to the football section of realgm.com.

In 2008, Marcus Allen joined as a spokesman for a sports website OPENSports.com, the brainchild of [[Mike Levy]] founder and former CEO of [[CBS Sportsline.com]].  Allen also writes a [[NFL]] [[blog]] and occasionally answers members' questions for OPEN Sports.<ref name="open">{{cite web |title=Marcus Allen |url=http://www.opensports.com/marcusallen |work=OPEN Sports |publisher=OPEN Sports Network |accessdate=May 11, 2009}}</ref>
