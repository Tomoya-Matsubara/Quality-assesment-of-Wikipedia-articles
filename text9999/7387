'''Gaitana''', also known as '''Guaitipan,''' is referred to as '''La Gaitana''' and '''Cacica Gaitana''', was a 16th-century Yalcon woman from the region of Timan<U+00E1>, Huila, a leader who, in 1539<U+2013>40, led the indigenous people of the Upper Magdalena River Valley in [[Colombia]] in armed resistance against the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonization by the Spanish]]. Her monument sculpted by [[Rodrigo Arenas]] stands in [[Neiva]], the capital of the [[Huila Department]] in Colombia.

== The indigenous people ==
According to [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] chronologists, at the time of conquest, the modern territory of [[Huila Department]] was inhabited by many different peoples. The [[:es:Yalc<U+00F3>n|Yalc<U+00F3>n]] People (with nearly 6,000 warriors), the Avirama, the Pinao, the [[Misak|Guanaca]] and the [[Paez people|Paez]] lived north of the [[Magdalena River]], with later concentrated around the La Plata River. South of the Magdalena River lived the [[Andaqui]] and [[:es:Timanaes|Timana]] and to the East lived the [[Pijao]] peoples.

== Pedro de A<U+00F1>asco ==
Pedro de A<U+00F1>asco was a Spanish conqueror, sent by [[Sebasti<U+00E1>n de Belalc<U+00E1>zar]] to found a village in the territory of what is today [[Timana]], in order to create a trade route through the [[Magdalena River]] valley.

A<U+00F1>asco called all the indigenous leaders and demanded that they pay him a tribute. A tribe of Yalcon people, commanded by a young man and his mother (Gaitana Cacica) delayed the payment, and A<U+00F1>asco decided to set an example by ordering her son to be burned alive.

== Revenge ==
The execution of Gaitana's son caused outrage among the indigenous tribes, who decided to cooperate with each other to join forces against the Spaniards. A<U+00F1>asco and his men were attacked by surprise. The men were executed and A<U+00F1>asco had his eyes removed and was dragged around the village until he died.

== Betrayal ==
However, one of the indigenous leaders, [[Cacique Matambo]], betrayed the organized indigenous forces. Matambo warned the Spaniards about plans against them with the result that the indigenous forces were crushed and the remaining indigenous people were gradually exterminated by slavery, [[smallpox]] and other European diseases.
