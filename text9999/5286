'''Hans Thomas Reiser''' (born December 19, 1963) is an [[United States|American]] [[computer programmer]], [[entrepreneur]], and convicted [[murder]]er. He is the creator and primary developer of the [[ReiserFS]] computer [[file system]], which is contained within the [[Linux kernel]], as well as its attempted successor, [[Reiser4]]. In 2004 he founded [[Namesys]], a corporation meant to coordinate the development of both file systems. In April 2008, Reiser was convicted of the [[first degree murder]] of his wife, Nina Reiser, who disappeared in September 2006. He subsequently pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of [[second-degree murder]], as part of a settlement agreement that included disclosing the location of his wife's body, revealed to be in a shallow grave near the couple's home.

==Namesys and ReiserFS==
:''Main articles: [[ReiserFS]] and [[Reiser4]]''

Reiser and his company Namesys developed the [[journaling file system|journaled]] [[computer]] [[file system]]s ReiserFS and Reiser4. ReiserFS has been available in the [[Linux]] operating system since version 2.4.1 and has at times been the default filesystem on several Linux distributions including, until 2006, Novell's [[SUSE Linux]] Enterprise.

Following Reiser's 2006 arrest on suspicion of murder, people in the [[free software community]] expressed concern over the future of Reiser's filesystem ([[Reiser4]]).<ref name="tocontinue"/> Jonathan Corbet, editor of [[LWN.net]], argued that the immaturity of Reiser4's feature set and Reiser's extensive combative relationship with the community meant the filesystem's future had been limited in any event.<ref>

Shortly after Reiser's arrest, the employees of [[Namesys]] stated they would continue to work, that the arrest had no immediate effect on the rate of the software's development, and if the case expanded over a longer time, they would seek solutions to ensure the long-term future of the company.<ref>

Nina Reiser filed for divorce three months later, citing irreconcilable differences and saying that their children "hardly know their father" because he was out of the country on business for most of the year, according to court records, and was granted sole legal custody of the children and shared physical custody of them with her husband.

==Trial and conviction==
===Preliminary hearing===
====Forensic evidence====
The [[preliminary hearing]] opened on December 11, 2006, with Reiser being represented by attorney William Du Bois. At the hearing, a forensic technician testified that blood matching Nina Reiser's DNA had been found on a bag in Hans Reiser's car, and on a pillar in his mother's (Beverly Palmer's) house, where he had been living since the separation. It later emerged that a mistake had been made when the police analysed the blood on the pillar, rendering the evidence inconclusive.<ref>{{cite news|first=David|last=Kravets|publisher=Wired|date=January 23, 2008|url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/01/scientist-now-n.html |title=Reiser Prosecution Wobbles Under Police Forensics Gaffe}}</ref> Police also testified that they had found a 40-piece socket set which may have been used to remove the passenger seat, a receipt for the purchase of the [[socket set]] from [[Kragen Auto Parts]], four seat bolts, and a wrench with a socket in it, suggesting that the seat may have been removed recently.<ref>{{cite news |title=Reiser wants speedy trial|publisher=[[Oakland Tribune]]|author=Jason Dearen |date=November 28, 2006 |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20061128/ai_n16871651 |accessdate=2007-02-20 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Henry K.|last=Lee|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/12/21/BAG29N3O5N1.DTL&hw=reiser&sn=001&sc=1000 |title=DNA match of bloodstains in case of missing wife|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2006-12-21|accessdate=2006-12-21}}</ref> A traffic officer who had pulled Reiser over nine days after Reiser's wife went missing testified later in the trial that the passenger seat had been present at the time, and that he had not seen any blood.<ref>{{cite news|first=David|last=Kravets|publisher=Wired|date=December 18, 2007|url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/12/traffic-officer.html |title=Traffic Officer Says He Saw No Blood on Reiser's Car Seat}}</ref>

====Police surveillance testimony====
During the third day of the preliminary hearing, on December 16, 2006, Officer Gino Guerrero stated that Reiser had engaged in a lengthy cat-and-mouse game with surveillance officers who were trailing him on the evening of September 18, 2006. When Reiser left family court in Oakland in the afternoon of September 18, he was trailed by police officers using both cars and an airplane. According to a probable cause statement, Reiser and a male friend "appeared to be conducting [[counter surveillance]]" to avoid police by driving at varying speeds, turning down small residential streets and making abrupt stops.<ref name="ebdaily20061214">{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Officer: Murder defendant hid car after wife's disappearance|publisher=[[East Bay Daily News]]|date=December 14, 2006 |url=http://www.ebdailynews.com/article/2006-12-14-bcn-37|accessdate=2007-06-30|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927234957/http://www.ebdailynews.com/article/2006-12-14-bcn-37|archivedate=2007-09-27}}</ref>

Reiser and his friend eventually dined at Fonda restaurant in Albany and afterwards the friend dropped Reiser at the corner of San Pablo and Ashby avenues in Berkeley. Guerrero said that Reiser walked around the area furtively, stopping occasionally to look in all directions, and eventually got into a 1988 Honda CRX which was parked on Acton Street near Carleton Street. Guerrero said police then followed Reiser as he drove the car to 2425 Monterey Road in Oakland, less than three miles (5&nbsp;km) away from where Reiser was living with his mother.

Reiser's mother, Beverly Palmer, testified that she had been out of town the weekend Nina Reiser disappeared and was surprised to learn that her son was driving her car, a 2003 Honda Hybrid, and that his Honda CRX was not at the house. Palmer said that when she asked her son where the CRX was, he said it was not working and ''"he'd take care of it and I should never mind"''.<ref name="ebdaily20061214"/>

====Reiser's son fails to testify====
On January 17, 2007, the Reisers' seven-year-old son, Rory, was scheduled to testify, but failed to appear. Judge Julie Conger asked that their son return to court and clarify his testimony, but he never did because his maternal grandmother failed to bring the children back from Russia as promised.<ref name="ktvu20070309">{{cite web |url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/11214659/detail.html |title=Judge Says Hans Reiser Can Stand Trial For Murder|publisher=[[KTVU|KTVU.com]]|date= March 9, 2007|accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref> She had since begun [[Russian court]] custody proceedings.

It was originally thought that Reiser's son would not return to testify in his father's trial; however, in a surprising move by Alameda County District Attorney Paul Hora, Rory Reiser arrived from Russia to testify before Judge Larry Goodman. Prosecutor Greg Dolge stated that he spoke to the grandmother and that Reiser's son was under the care of a therapist in Russia who wanted him to stay in Russia for further treatment.  It was also revealed that Nina Reiser had obtained Russian citizenship for her children <U+2013> two years previously in the case of her daughter, and two months before for her son.<ref name="sfgate070119">{{cite web |first= Henry K. |last=Lee|page=B-3|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/01/19/BAGE2NL9VV1.DTL | title =Judge lifts request for boy to testify in alleged killing |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=January 19, 2007|accessdate=2007-03-10 }}</ref>

When Reiser testified in his own defense, his implausible claims and erratic behavior in the courtroom largely undermined his claim of innocence.<ref>{{cite web|last=Paul |first=Ryan |url=http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/07/reiserfs-fading-into-obscurity-as-maker-leads-cops-to-corpse.ars |title=ReiserFS fading into obscurity as maker leads cops to corpse |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=2008-07-08 |accessdate=2010-02-08}}</ref> After three days of trial, the prosecutor concluded his opening statements urging jurors to convict Hans Reiser for murdering his wife.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/11/prosecutor-call.html |title=Reiser is a 'Killer', Prosecutor Proclaims; Judge Denies Mistrial in Day 3 of Linux Engineer's Murder Trial |publisher=Wired, ThreatLevel Blog |author=Kravets, David |date=November 8, 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> In his closing argument, Reiser's attorney, William DuBois, urged the jury to consider a sentence of voluntary manslaughter if they believed that Nina was dead and that Hans Reiser killed her in a moment of passion.<ref>

On Monday, April 28, 2008, Hans Reiser was found guilty of [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees of murder in the United States|first degree murder]].<ref name="SFGate 2008"/>

===Recovery of Nina's body and sentencing===
Prosecutors agreed to a deal whereby Reiser would reveal the location of his wife's body in exchange for pleading guilty to [[Murder (United States law)|second-degree murder]]. The deal was made with the agreement of Nina's family, but it was subject to final approval by Judge Goodman.<ref name="SFGate 2008">{{cite news

Reiser's attorney, William DuBois, who was handcuffed to Reiser and accompanied by a heavy police guard to the site, said that the remains were found buried on the side of a hill between [[Redwood Regional Park]] and the [[Huckleberry Botanic Regional Preserve]], less than half a mile from the home on Exeter Drive where Reiser lived with his mother, and where Nina Reiser was last seen alive on September 3, 2006.<ref name=sfgate0707>{{cite web | last = Lee|first = Henry K. | authorlink = | coauthors = Jaxon Van Derbeken, Chronicle Staff Writers | title = Wife-killer leads cops to body in deal with D.A. | work =|publisher = [[San Francisco Chronicle|SFGate]] |page=A-1| date = 2008-07-07|url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/07/07/BAN011LDR8.DTL | doi =|accessdate = 2008-07-08}}</ref> Oakland homicide detective Lt.
