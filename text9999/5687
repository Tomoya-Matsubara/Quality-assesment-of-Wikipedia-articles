'''Kwanzaa''' is a weeklong celebration held in the [[United States]] honoring universal [[Africa]]n heritage and culture, marked by participants lighting a [[kinara]] (candle holder).<ref name="Why Kwanzaa">{{cite web|url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/kwanzaa.html|publisher="[[Ron Karenga]]"|title="Why Kwanzaa Video"}}</ref> It is observed from December 26 to January 1 every year.

Kwanzaa consists of seven days of celebration, featuring activities such as candle-lighting and [[libation]]s, and culminating in a feast and [[gift]] giving. It was created by [[Ron Karenga]] and was first celebrated from December 26, 1966 to January 1, 1967. 

==History and etymology==
[[Maulana Karenga]] created Kwanzaa in 1966 as the first specifically African American holiday.<ref name="Kwanzaa Date">{{cite web|url=http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F00B1EFD395C0C738FDDAB0994DB484D81|work=[[New York Times]]"|title=The Evening Hours|date=1983-12-30 |accessdate=2006-12-15}}</ref>  Karenga said his goal was to "give Blacks an alternative to the existing holiday and give Blacks an opportunity to celebrate themselves and history, rather than simply imitate the practice of the dominant society."<ref>[http://www.believersweb.org/view.cfm?ID=917 Kwanzaa: origin, concepts, practice] p. 21 {{Dubious|date=December 2009}}<!-- this is self published material in a mere blog, purporting to quote Karenga --></ref> The name Kwanzaa derives from the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] phrase ''matunda ya kwanza'', meaning first fruits of the harvest.<ref name="scott">Megan K. Scott, "[http://www.buffalonews.com/260/story/897568.html Kwanzaa celebrations continue, but boom is over]", ''Buffalo News,'' 17 December 2009. Accessed 25 December 2009.</ref> The choice of Swahili, an [[East Africa]]n language, reflects its status as a symbol of [[Pan-Africanism]], especially in the 1960s.

Kwanzaa is a celebration that has its roots in the [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] movement of the 1960s, and was established as a means to help African Americans reconnect with their African cultural and historical heritage by uniting in meditation and study of African traditions and common [[Humanism|humanist]] principles.

The first [[Holiday stamp#Kwanzaa stamp|Kwanzaa stamp]] was issued by the [[United States Postal Service]] on October 22, 1997, with artwork by Synthia Saint James.<ref>[http://www.officialkwanzaawebsite.org/kwanzaastamp.shtml Bringing Good Into the World]</ref> In 2004, a second Kwanzaa stamp, designed by [[Daniel Minter]], was issued; this has seven figures in colorful robes symbolizing the seven principles.<ref>[http://www.usps.com/communications/news/stamps/2004/sr04_070.htm Kwanzaa featured on this year's holiday U.S. postage stamp]</ref>

During the early years of Kwanzaa, Karenga said that it was meant to be an alternative to Christmas, that Jesus was psychotic, and that Christianity was a white religion that black people should shun.<ref name="karenga1967">{{cite book

The origins of Kwanzaa are not secret and are openly acknowledged by those promoting the holiday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialkwanzaawebsite.org/origins1.shtml| title=The Official Kwanzaa Website - Founders Message|accessdate=2005-12-30}}</ref> Many Christian African Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa do so in addition to observing Christmas.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/20/garden/in-blacks-homes-the-christmas-and-kwanzaa-spirits-meet.html?pagewanted=1</ref>

==Principles of Kwanzaa==
<!--This section is linked from Nguzo Saba. When changing the heading name please take care to update this page as well.-->
Kwanzaa celebrates what its founder called the seven principles of Kwanzaa, or ''Nguzo Saba'' (originally ''Nguzu Saba''<U+2014>the seven principles of blackness), which Karenga said "is a [[communitarian]] African philosophy," consisting of what Karenga called "the best of African thought and practice in constant exchange with the world." These seven principles comprise ''[[Kawaida]]'', a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] term for [[tradition]] and [[reason]].  Each of the seven days of Kwanzaa is dedicated to one of the following principles, as follows:

*''Umoja''  (Unity): To strive for and to maintain unity in the family, community, nation, and race.
*''Kujichagulia''  (Self-Determination): To define ourselves, name ourselves, create for ourselves, and speak for ourselves.
*''Ujima'' (Collective Work and Responsibility): To build and maintain our community together and make our brothers' and sisters' problems our problems, and to solve them together.  
*''Ujamaa'' (Cooperative Economics): To build and maintain our own stores, shops, and other businesses and to profit from them together.
*''Nia''  (Purpose): To make our collective vocation the building and developing of our community in order to restore our people to their traditional greatness.
*''Kuumba'' (Creativity): To do always as much as we can, in the way we can, in order to leave our community more beautiful and beneficial than we inherited it.
*''Imani'' (Faith): To believe with all our heart in our people, our parents, our teachers, our leaders, and the righteousness and victory of our struggle.

==Popularity==
In his 2004 Presidential Kwanzaa Message, [[George W. Bush]] said, "During Kwanzaa, millions of African Americans and people of African descent gather to celebrate their heritage and ancestry. Kwanzaa celebrations provide an opportunity to focus on the importance of family, community, and history and to reflect on the Nguzo Saba or seven principles of African culture. These principles emphasize unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith."<ref name="bush2004">{{cite web

In 2004, BIG Research conducted a marketing survey in the United States for the [[National Retail Foundation]], which found that 1.6% of those surveyed planned to celebrate Kwanzaa. If generalized to the US population as a whole, this would imply that around 4.7 million Americans planned to celebrate Kwanzaa in that year.<ref>[http://www.nrf.com/content/default.asp?folder=press/holiday&file=HolidayRegion1004.htm "2004 Holiday Spending by Region"], 'Survey by BIGresearch, conducted for [[National Retail Foundation]]', 14 October 2004</ref> In a 2006 speech, Ron Karenga asserted that 28 million people celebrate Kwanzaa.  He has always maintained it is celebrated all over the world.<ref name="Why Kwanzaa" /> Lee D. Baker<!-- Who is he? --> puts the number at 12 million.<ref>Manning Marable, ''Dispatches from the Ebony Tower,'' p. 224.</ref> The African American Cultural Center claims 30 million.<ref name="scott" />

According to Keith Mayes, the author of ''Kwanzaa: Black Power and the Making of the African-American Holiday Tradition,'' the popularity within the US has "leveled off" as the black power movement there has declined, and now between half and two million people celebrate Kwanzaa in the US, or between one and five percent of African Americans. Mayes adds that white institutions now celebrate it.<ref name="mayesscott">Keith Mayes, cited by Megan K.

==Observance==
Families celebrating Kwanzaa decorate their households with objects of art; colorful African cloth such as [[kente]], especially the wearing of [[Wrapper (clothing)|kaftans]] by women; and fresh fruits that represent African idealism. It is customary to include children in Kwanzaa ceremonies and to give respect and gratitude to ancestors. [[Libations]] are shared, generally with a common chalice, ''Kikombe cha Umoja'', passed around to all celebrants. Non-African Americans also celebrate Kwanzaa.<ref name="mayesscott" /> The holiday greeting is "Joyous Kwanzaa".<ref name="bush2004"/><ref name="clinton1997">{{cite news

A Kwanzaa ceremony may include drumming and musical selections, libations, a reading of the African Pledge and the Principles of Blackness, reflection on the [[Pan-African colors]], a discussion of the African principle of the day or a chapter in African history, a candle-lighting ritual, artistic performance, and, finally, a feast ([[Karamu (feast)|Karamu]]). The greeting for each day of Kwanzaa is ''Habari Gani?''<ref>[http://www.swagga.com/kwanzaa.htm Kwanzaa Greeting]</ref> which is Swahili for "What's the News?"<ref>[http://www.swagga.com/model.htm A Model Kwanzaa Ceremony]</ref>

At first, observers of Kwanzaa avoided the mixing of the holiday or its symbols, values, and practice with other holidays, as doing so would violate the principle of ''kujichagulia'' (self-determination) and thus violate the integrity of the holiday, which is partially intended as a reclamation of important African values. Today, many African American families celebrate Kwanzaa along with [[Christmas]] and [[New Year's]]. Frequently, both Christmas trees and [[kinara]]s, the traditional candle holder symbolic of African American roots, share space in kwanzaa-celebrating households. To them, Kwanzaa is an opportunity to incorporate elements of their particular ethnic heritage into holiday observances and celebrations of Christmas.

Cultural exhibitions include the Spirit of Kwanzaa, an annual celebration held at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] featuring [[interpretive dance]], [[African dance]], song and poetry.<ref> [http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showEvent&past=true&event=RHXAP The Spirit of Kwanzaa]</ref><ref>[http://www.danceinstitute.org/aboutus3g.html The Dance Institute of Washington]</ref>

==Evolution in Kwanzaa's observance==
In 1977, in ''Kwanzaa: origin, concepts, practice'', Karenga stated that Kwanzaa "was chosen to give a Black alternative to the existing holiday and give Blacks an opportunity to celebrate themselves and history, rather than simply imitate the practice of the dominant society."<ref>Kwanzaa: origin, concepts, practice, p. 21, cited at {{cite web|url=http://www.believersweb.org/view.cfm?ID=917|title=Believersweb.org|accessdate=2005-12-29}}</ref>  

In 1997, Karenga and the community evolved, stating that while Kwanzaa is an African-American holiday, it can be celebrated by people of any race: "Other people can and do celebrate it, just like other people participate in Cinco de Mayo besides Mexicans; Chinese New Year besides Chinese; Native American pow wows besides Native Americans."<ref>Kwanzaa: A Celebration of Family, Community and Culture, p. 110, cited at {{cite web|url=http://www.believersweb.org/view.cfm?ID=917 |title=Believersweb.org|accessdate=2005-12-29}}</ref>{{Dubious|date=December 2009}}

Currently, according to the Official Kwanzaa Web Site (written by Karenga and maintained by Organization US, which Karenga chairs), "Kwanzaa was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday. And it is not an alternative to people's religion or faith but a common ground of African culture...Kwanzaa is not a reaction or substitute for anything. In fact, it offers a clear and self-conscious option, opportunity, and chance to make a proactive choice, a self-affirming and positive choice as distinct from a reactive one."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialkwanzaawebsite.org/faq.shtml|title=The Official Kwanzaa Web Site|accessdate=2005-12-29}}</ref>  

Karenga's most recent interpretation emphasizes that while every people has its own holiday traditions, all people can share in the celebration of our common humanity:  "Any particular message that is good for a particular people, if it is human in its content and ethical in its grounding, speaks not just to that people, it speaks to the world."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialkwanzaawebsite.org/faq.shtml|title=The Official Kwanzaa Website FAQ|accessdate=2005-12-29}}</ref>

In the late 2000s, Kwanzaa has been observed less commonly, with its popularity fading. For some people the holiday no longer holds the same significance it had in the 1970s.<ref>"[http://www.freep.com/article/20091226/FEATURES01/912260307/1322/Kwanzaa-popularity-wanes Kwanzaa popularity wanes]", "Detroit Free Press"</ref>
