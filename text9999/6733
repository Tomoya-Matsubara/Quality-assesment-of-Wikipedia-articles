[[Image:Kylieminogueinyoureyes.jpg|left|thumb|A scene from the "In Your Eyes" music video.]]
"In Your Eyes" featured a [[music video]] that was [[Music video director|directed]] by [[Dawn Shadforth]]. The video features Minogue in a studio filled with colourful neon lights. There are two sequences; the first features Minogue and a group of dancers in front of a colourful background, the second is simply Minogue spinning before a background of flashing lights.

The video featured an extension of the futuristic theme first introduced in the music video for "[[Can't Get You out of My Head]]" the previous year. Minogue and her artistic director [[William Baker (fashion designer)|William Baker]] had become interested in the street interpretation of robotic, jerky movements and included this is the video. The costumes also represent this interest and were described by Baker as being a mix of "hip hop chic with sci-fi lunacy".<ref>''La La La'', William Baker and Kylie Minogue, Hodder and Stoughton, 2002.
