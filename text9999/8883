[[Image:Horodlo Unia.jpg|right|thumb|Act of the union]]

The '''Union of Horod<U+0142>o''' or '''Pact of Horod<U+0142>o''' was a set of three acts signed in the town of [[Horod<U+0142>o]] on October 2, 1413. The first act was written by [[Jogaila]], King of Poland, and [[Vytautas]], Grand Duke of Lithuania. The second and third acts were composed by the [[Lithuanian nobility|Lithuanian]] and [[Polish nobility]] (szlachta) respectively.<ref name=suzie/> The union amended the earlier [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian union]]s of [[Union of Krewo|Krewo]] and [[Union of Vilnius and Radom|Vilnius<U+2013>Radom]]. Politically, Lithuania received more autonomy as, after the death of Vytautas, the Lithuanian nobles could choose another Grand Duke instead of passing the title to Jogaila or his heir. However, culturally, Lithuania and Poland grew closer. Lithuania adopted Polish institutions of [[castellan]]s and [[voivode]]s. Catholic Lithuanian nobles and church officials were granted equal rights with the Polish nobles and clergy. Selected 47 Lithuanian nobles were adopted by Polish families and granted [[Polish heraldry|Polish coats of arm]]. Thus the union signified the beginnings of [[Polonization]] of the Lithuanian culture and the rise of the Lithuanian nobility. It was one of the major steps towards modernization and Europeanization of Lithuania.<ref name=kiaupa/>

==Historical background==
[[Image:Jagiellon countries 1490m9.PNG|right|thumb|Poland (darker pink) and Lithuania (lighter pink) around 1490]]
Poland and Lithuania were joined in a [[personal union]] since the [[Union of Krewo]] of 1385. Both countries were ruled by Jogaila. However, after the [[Lithuanian Civil War (1389<U+2013>1392)]] and the [[Ostr<U+00F3>w Agreement]], Vytautas gained the supreme power in Lithuania.<ref name=stone/> The legal basis for the Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian relations were revisited by the [[Union of Vilnius and Radom]] of 1401, which reiterated ''[[de facto]]'' Lithuanian independence and ''[[de jure]]'' Polish supremacy. Vytautas was titled as the Grand Duke (''magnus dux'') and enjoyed wast power in Lithuania, while technically he was subordinate to Jogaila, Greater Duke (''supremus dux'') and King of Poland.<ref name=kiaupa/> The union was signed after the Vytautas' army was soundly defeated in the [[Battle of the Vorskla River]] and weakened Lithuania was looking for Polish support.<ref name=stone/> Taking advantage of the Lithuanian defeat, the [[Principality of Smolensk]], [[Veliky Novgorod]], and [[Pskov Republic|Pskov]] rebelled against the Lithuanian rule, drawing Vytautas into a war with the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]].<ref name=ivin/> However, within few years peace was reestablished in the east.

In 1409, the [[second Samogitian uprising]] against the [[Teutonic Knights]] escalated into the [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian<U+2013>Teutonic War]]. Joint Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian forces defeated the Knights in the decisive [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410. However, the war did not resolve all the disputes and by 1413 Poland<U+2013>Lithuania was preparing for another war with the Knights (see [[Hunger War]]).<ref name=kiaupa/><ref name=urban/> These developments encouraged Poland and Lithuania to review their relations.

==Provisions==
The treaty repeated the indissoluble character of the Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian union while carefully balancing Polish and Lithuanian interest. The Lithuanians gained more autonomy as they received the right to elect a new Grand Duke after the death of Vytautas.<ref name=kiaupa/> The earlier [[Union of Vilnius and Radom]] stipulated that Lithuania would pass to Jogaila or his heir. However, the Lithuanian nobles promised to consult the Polish nobles when choosing a successor to Vytautas. The reverse was also true: the Polish nobles promised to consult with the Lithuanians when electing the next Polish King.<ref name=suzie/> The pact contained one of the first mentions of the [[Seimas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. The Polish and Lithuanian nobles agreed to hold a joint [[general sejm]] to discuss all major matters, but such sejm did not take place until 1564.<ref name=suzie/> Nevertheless, it was a recognition of political powers of the Lithuanian nobles.<ref name=kiaupa/>

The Lithuanian nobles and clergy were granted equal rights with the Polish nobility and clergy.<ref name=ivin367/> However, this extended only to Catholics; many [[Ruthenia]]n nobles, who were [[Eastern Orthodox]]s, were excluded.<ref name=subte/> Selected Lithuanian nobles, 47 in total, were adopted by Polish families and granted [[Polish heraldry|Polish coats of arm]]. This symbolic gesture signified the desire to adopt Western customs and integrate into the Western society.<ref name=kiaupa/> Equal rights encouraged cooperation and kinship between Polish and Lithuanian nobles. Influence of the Polish culture continued to increase, culminating in the [[Union of Lublin]] of 1569.<ref name=suzie/>

Another significant resolution was adoption of Polish administrative divisions and offices like [[voivode]] and [[castellan]] by Lithuania. The union created [[Trakai Voivodeship|Voivodeships of Trakai]] and [[Vilnius Voivodeship|Vilnius]], governed by two Lithuanian nobles.<ref name=kiaupa/> Former Slavic principalities and duchies largely preserved their old political, social, and administrative features for another century. [[Kiev Voivodeship]] was established in 1471, other five voivodeships were established between 1504 and 1514.<ref name=suzie_admin/> This administrative change signified modernization of the Grand Duchy and decline of traditional dynastic politics. Previously major regions of the Grand Duchy were ruled by members of the ruling dynasty (siblings, children, cousins, etc. of the Grand Duke). Such principalities remained semi-independent and their rulers could become powerful rivals of the Grand Duke with their own claims to the throne.<ref name=suzie_admin/> The new voivodeships were governed by trustworthy nobles, unrelated to the royal clan, who could be easily replaced. Soon the nobility replaced members of the ruling dynasty as the driving force behind the Lithuanian politics.
