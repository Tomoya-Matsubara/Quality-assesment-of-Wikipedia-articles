Located in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]], the '''OMAR Mine Museum''' contains a collection of 51 types of [[land mine]]s out of the 53 used in Afghanistan over the years. The collection includes [[unexploded ordnance]], [[cluster bomb]]s and airdrop bombs used by the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|U.S. invasion in 2002]].

OMAR stands for the [[Organization for Mine Clearance and Afghan Rehabilitation]].

For security reasons, the museum is not open for casual visitors. All appointments must be made through the main OMAR office.

Dr. [[Shah Walie]] is one of the primary organizers of the museum.

Apart from mines, the museum displays a variety of other military hardware from wars fought in Afghanistan over the recent decades, including artillery, surface-to-air missiles, and a collection of Soviet military aircraft.
