The '''1945 Homestead hurricane''' was the most intense [[tropical cyclone]] to [[Landfall (meteorology)|strike]] the U.S. state of [[Florida]] since [[1935 Labor Day hurricane|1935]]. The ninth [[tropical cyclone scales|tropical storm]], third hurricane, and third [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale|major hurricane]] of the [[1945 Atlantic hurricane season|season]], it developed [[boxing the compass|east-northeast]] of the [[Leeward Islands]] on September&nbsp;12. Moving briskly west-northwestward, the storm became a major hurricane on September&nbsp;13. The system moved over the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] the following day and then [[Andros]] on September&nbsp;15. Later that day, the storm peaked as a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane on the modern-day [[Saffir<U+2013>Simpson hurricane wind scale]] with winds of 130&nbsp;mph (215&nbsp;km/h). Late on September&nbsp;15, the hurricane made landfall on [[Key Largo, Florida|Key Largo]] and then in southern [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]].

Thereafter, the hurricane began to weaken while moving across Florida, falling to Category&nbsp;1 intensity only several hours after landfall late on September&nbsp;15. Eventually, it curved north-northeastward and approached the east coast of Florida again. Late on September&nbsp;16, the storm emerged into the Atlantic near [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] and weakened to a tropical storm early on the following day. The cyclone made another landfall near the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]-[[South Carolina]] state line later on September&nbsp;17. The system continued to weaken and transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] near the border of [[North Carolina]] and [[Virginia]] early on September&nbsp;18.

The storm caused significant damage and 22 deaths in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Bahamas. In Florida, the hardest hit area was [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]]. Most of the city of [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]] was destroyed, while at the [[Richmond Naval Air Station]], a fire ignited during the storm burned down three hangers worth $3&nbsp;million (1945&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]) each. Throughout the state, the strong winds destroyed 1,632&nbsp;residences and damaged 5,372&nbsp;homes others. Four people died, including the fire chief of the Richmond station. In [[the Carolinas]], the storm produced heavy rainfall, causing flash flooding, particularly along the [[Cape Fear River]] in North Carolina. Overall, the hurricane resulted in 26&nbsp;fatalities and about $60&nbsp;million in damage.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|1945 Atlantic hurricane 9 track.png}}
The hurricane was first observed on September&nbsp;12 about 235&nbsp;mi (380&nbsp;km) east-northeast of [[Barbuda]] in the [[Lesser Antilles]]. Around that time, the winds were estimated at 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h), and later that day, the [[Hurricane Hunters]] recorded peripheral winds of 54&nbsp;mph (87&nbsp;km/h). Moving quickly to the west-northwest, the hurricane quickly intensified while passing north of Puerto Rico, reaching the equivalent of a modern-day [[Tropical cyclone scales#Atlantic and East Pacific|major hurricane]] with winds of 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h). The strength was based on another Hurricane Hunters mission reporting flight-level winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h). After passing north of Hispaniola, the hurricane turned moved toward the [[Bahamas]], approaching or passing over [[Grand Turk Island]] at 0530&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on September&nbsp;14. A station on the island observed a [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] of {{convert|977|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} during the passage, and nearby [[Clarence Town]] reported winds of 104&nbsp;mph (168&nbsp;km/h). While moving through the Bahamas, the hurricane turned more to the northwest. It was a smaller than average storm, and continued intensifying while moving toward southeastern Florida.<ref name="meta">{{cite report|author=Christopher Landsea, et al.|date=June 2013|title=Documentation of Atlantic Tropical Cyclones Changes in HURDAT (1945)|publisher=Hurricane Research Division|accessdate=2014-03-13|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/metadata_master.html#1945_9}}</ref> 

At 1930&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;15, the hurricane made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on [[Key Largo]], and about a half hour later struck the Florida mainland.<ref name="meta"/> The center passed very close to [[Homestead Air Reserve Base]] about an hour after landfall, where a central [[barometric pressure]] of {{convert|951|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} was recorded.<ref name="meta"/><ref name="MWR">{{cite journal|volume=74|number=1|author=H.

This estimate was backed up by gust of 138&nbsp;mph (222&nbsp;km/h) at [[Carysfort Reef Light]]. The hurricane weakened over Florida while curving to the north and north-northeast, although the proximity to water and the passage over the [[Everglades]] limited substantial weakening. Hurricane force winds spread across much of Florida until the storm emerged into the western Atlantic near [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] late on September&nbsp;16. At around 0000&nbsp;UTC the next day, the hurricane weakened to tropical storm status. About 11&nbsp;hours later, it made another landfall near the border between [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]] with winds of 70&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="meta"/>

After continuing through the southeast United States, the storm became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] near the border of [[North Carolina]] and [[Virginia]] midday on September&nbsp;18. Although it initially maintained tropical storm-force winds, the former hurricane weakened below gale-force on September&nbsp;19 while it was near [[Philadelphia]]. The storm continued rapidly to the northeast, moving through New England and along the coast of Maine before turning more to the east. Late on September&nbsp;19, the storm moved across [[Nova Scotia]], passing southeast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] the next day. It was last observed late on September&nbsp;20 dissipating to the east of Newfoundland.<ref name="meta"/> 

==Preparations==
Although [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane warnings]] were initially issued for the Leeward Islands, the cyclone passed north of the Lesser Antilles.<ref name="meta" /> In advance of the storm, aircraft were evacuated from the Naval Air Station in [[Miami, Florida]], where hundreds of planes left vulnerable locations.<ref name="Lima">{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|year=1945|title=Tropical Wind Nears Florida|newspaper=The Lima News|accessdate=2014-03-09}}</ref> <ref name="Dunkirk" /> Residents were advised to heed advisories in Florida, the Bahamas, and northern [[Cuba]].<ref name="estimated">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1928&dat=19450915&id=W50gAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OmgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4955,5139525|title=Florida On Alert As Gale Sweeps Towards The Keys|date=September 15, 1945|newspaper=The Lewiston Daily News|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref> On September 15, hurricane force winds were expected to affect areas from [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] through the [[Florida Keys]], and hurricane warnings were accordingly released for this region.
