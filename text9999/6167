'''"Donnie Fatso"''' is the eleventh episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 22)|twenty-second season]] of the animated comedy series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It first aired on [[Fox]] in the United States on December 12, 2010. The plot revolves around an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI agent]], who helps Homer go undercover to infiltrate Fat Tony's mob. Homer agrees to this in hopes of decreasing his sentence after being charged for bribery. 

"Donnie Fatso" was written by Chris Cluess and directed by Ralph Sosa. Critics were polarized with the episode, with criticism stemming from its main plot and cultural references. Upon its initial airing, the episode received 7.32 million viewers and attained a 3.2/8 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to [[Nielson ratings]]. "Donnie Fatso" featured guest appearances from [[Jon Hamm]] and [[Joe Mantegna]], as well as several recurring voice actors and actresses for the series.

==Plot==
Homer and Marge wake on [[New Year's Day]] with hangovers after the family's [[New Year's Eve]] celebration. Homer takes out the garbage but [[Chief Wiggum]] and his cops arrive and inform Homer that the town has approved new [[dumb law]]s and Homer racks up a series of spurious [[Fine (penalty)|fines]]. With fines of $1000, [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] suggests Homer [[bribe]] an official, but Wiggum catches him in the act and arrests him. After being sentenced to ten years in jail, Wiggum takes pity on Homer and suggests he talk with an FBI investigator who offers to reduce his jail time if Homer agrees to go [[undercover]] as an informant to investigate [[Fat Tony]]. Meanwhile, Marge becomes upset by Homer's "disappearance".

After freeing Homer from jail, Fat Tony lets Homer spend time with his gang. Impressed with Homer's attitude, Fat Tony decides to test him. His first order was to [[Arson|burn]] down Moe's Tavern (a revenge for the latter's rudeness towards Tony when he mistakes Tony's telephone call [[Bart Simpson|for a prank]]), but fortunately, Homer does not need to lift a finger as Moe already has done this in order to avoid sanitary inspection ("''it's that or put in a ladies room!''"). Homer is accepted into the mafia family and forges a special bond with Fat Tony. However, internal conflict sets in as the mafia was attempting to import Belgian guns. Fat Tony later finds out that Homer is an informant for the government and, emotionally unable to endure the betrayal, dies of heart attack.

Marge is pleased that Homer has his sentence scrapped and is able to come back home. Unable to bear the guilt from being associated with the death of Fat Tony, Homer decides to apologise to him at his grave, only to have Fat Tony's cousin Fit Tony kidnap him to settle a score. However, after Homer explains that he does not care about death, they have a conversation and come to the conclusion that the real culprits for killing Fat Tony were the government agents who spied on them. Fit Tony then assumes the family's management, but the stress of his new position makes him eat much more than the normal and he ends up becoming the new Fat Tony (another meta referential joke about the Simpsons' [[status quo]]).

Donnie Fatso was written by Chris Cluess and directed by Ralph Sosa. In July 2010, it was announced that [[Jon Hamm]] would make a guest appearance in the episode as an agent for the [[FBI]]. In his interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', showrunner [[Al Jean]] was pleased with Hamm's performance, opining: "You gave him one note and he immediately did twelve great things with it. He was really funny. And handsome. He had it all.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/07/20/jon-hamm-guest-star-mad-men-simpsons/|title='Simpsons' exclusive: John Hamm to guest|author=Dan Snierson|date=2010-07-20|accessdate=2010-07-20|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> Hamm stated that appearing on the show was "an incredible experience". In his interview with ''[[Access Hollywood]]'', he continued, "I got to work on ''The Simpsons'', which I watched for 20 years and the show is still fresh and still funny and the characters still resonate. It<U+2019>s one of the best shows on television.

"Donnie Fatso" features several references to music, film, media, and other pop culture phenomenon. The episode's plot and title are parodical to that of the film ''[[Donnie Brasco (film)|Donnie Brasco]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/07/jon-hamm-to-lend-his-voice-to-the-simpsons.html|title=Jon Hamm to lend his voice to 'The Simpsons'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2010-07-21|author=Villarreal, Yvonne}}</ref> At the end of the episode, Homer's monologue serves as a homage to monologue of Henry Hill in ''[[Goodfellas]]''.<ref name="avclub">{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/donnie-fatsothe-road-to-the-north-polefor-whom-the,48927/ |title="Donnie Fatso"/"The Road To The North Pole"/"For Whom The Sleigh Bell Tolls" |author=VanDerWerff, Todd |date=December 13, 2010 |work=''[[The A.V.

The episode was viewed by an estimated 7.31 million viewers, despite airing simultaneously with ''[[Extreme Makeover Home Edition]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], ''[[The Amazing Race (U.S. TV series)|The Amazing Race]]'' on [[CBS]], and a game between the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and the [[Dallas Cowboys]] as part of the [[2010 NFL season]] on [[NBC]].<ref name="overnight">{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/12/13/tv-ratings-sunday-bad-weather-close-game-sunday-night-football-highs-desperate-housewives-ties-season-lows/75182 |title=TV Ratings Sunday: Bad Weather, Close Game = 'Sunday Night Football' Highs; 'Desperate Housewives' Ties Season Lows |author=Seidman, Robert |date=December 13, 2010 |work=TVbythenumbers.zap2it.com |accessdate=2010-12-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/12/14/sunday-final-ratings-desperate-housewives-adjusted-up-the-simpsons-down-plus-amazing-race-undercover-boss-and-csi-miami/75412 |title=Sunday Final Ratings: 'Desperate Housewives,' Adjusted Up; 'The Simpsons,' Down; Plus 'Amazing Race,' 'Undercover Boss,' and 'CSI: Miami' |author=Seidman, Robert |date=December 14, 2010 |work=TV by the Numbers |accessdate=2010-12-19 }}</ref> "Donnie Fatso" garnered a 3.2/8 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to the [[Nielson ratings]].<ref name="overnight"/> The episode also became the third highest rated show of the week on Fox, only behind ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' and'' Family Guy''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/12/14/tv-ratings-broadcast-top-25-sunday-night-football-glee-two-and-a-half-men-modern-family-60-minutes-top-week-12-viewing/75340 |title=TV Ratings Broadcast Top 25: Sunday Night Football,' 'Glee,' 'Two and a Half Men,' 'Modern Family,' '60 Minutes' Top Week 12 Viewing |author=Seidman, Robert |date=December 14, 2010 |work=[[TV by the Numbers]] |accessdate=2010-12-19 }}</ref> Total viewership and ratings were significantly down from the previous episode, "[[The Fight Before Christmas]]", which received 9.56 million viewers and achieved a 4.2/11 rating in the 18-49 demographic.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gorman |first=Bill |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/12/06/tv-ratings-sunday-football-lifts-nbc-amazing-race-and-desperate-housewives-brothers-sisters-hit-season-lows/74360 |title=TV ratings Sunday: Football lifts NBC & Fox; <U+2018>Amazing Race<U+2019> & <U+2018>Undercover Boss<U+2019> down; And <U+2018>Desperate Housewives,<U+2019> <U+2018>Brothers & Sisters<U+2019> hit lows; <U+2018>The Simpsons<U+2019> hits season high |work=[[TV by the Numbers]] |date=December 6, 2010 |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref>

The episode attained mixed receptions from television critics. Todd VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a 'C' grade, scoring lower than "[[Road to the North Pole]]" of ''Family Guy'' and "[[For Whom the Sleigh Bell Tolls]]" of ''American Dad''.<ref name="avclub"/> VanDerWerff felt that the episode was "fairly lazy", and commented that the main plot was "too much of a mob movie pastiche."<ref name="avclub"/> Similarly, Ciara Moyner of ''Daemon's TV'' expressed that various parts of the episode were entertaining, but concluded that it was "ultimately forgettable".<ref name=daemons>{{cite web|url=http://www.daemonstv.com/2010/12/13/the-simpsons-donnie-fatso-review/|title=THE SIMPSONS <U+201C>Donnie Fatso<U+201D> Review|last=Moyner|first=Ciara|date=December 13, 2010|work=Daemon's TV|publisher=|accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref> Eric Hochberger of ''TV Fanatic'' criticized the humor of the episode, opining that "for an episode with such an overdone story, we could have forgiven things if it were at least funnier." He continued: "Unfortunately, there just weren't enough jokes to make the episode worth it." In conclusion of his review, Hochberger gave "Donnie Fatso" a 2.5 out of 5 stars.<ref name=tv>{{cite web |title=The Simpsons Review: "Donnie Fatso"|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2010/12/the-simpsons-review-donnie-fatso/|first=Eric|last=Hochberger|work=TV Fanatic|date=December 13, 2010|accessdate=Novermber 4, 2011}}</ref>

Critics were also polarized with the conclusion of Fat Tony, and the addition of Fit Tony. Moyner was apathetic towards the writers' decision to kill off Fat Tony, opining: "It's hard to feel sad about a character who overstayed his welcome by appearing for more than five minutes on screen."<ref name=daemons/> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' writer Darren Franich named Fat Tony's death the ninth Best TV Character Death of 2010, writing, "give the writers some credit for doing something different: In the middle of an otherwise straightforward mob-themed episode, they actually went ahead and killed off Fat Tony, a character who was first introduced almost twenty years ago."<ref name="ew">{{cite web |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/12/21/best-tv-character-deaths-2010/#more-116552 |title=The Best TV Character Deaths of 2010 |author=Franich, Darren |date=December 21, 2010 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=2010-12-21 }}</ref>

[[Dan Castellaneta]]'s performance in the episode, as Homer, Barney, Krusty and Louie, was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] at the [[63rd Primetime Emmy Awards]], but lost to [[Maurice LaMarche]], who received the award for his role in the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences]]".<ref name="11noms">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/sites/emmys.com/files/PressReleaseNoms2011emmys.pdf|title=2011 Primetime Emmy Awards Nominations|accessdate=2011-07-14|date=2011-07-14|publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]]}}</ref>
