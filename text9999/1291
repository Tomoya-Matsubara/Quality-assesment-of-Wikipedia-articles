'''Pupil''' is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[Pinoy rock|rock]] band composed of [[Ely Buendia]] on frontman duties and guitars, [[Pupil (band)#Yan Yuzon|Yan Yuzon]] on lead guitar, [[Pupil (band)#Dok Sergio|Dok Sergio]] on bass and [[Pupil (band)#Wendell Garcia|Wendell Garcia]] (who replaced [[Pupil (band)#Bogs Jugo|Bogs Jugo]]) on drums.

Although the band itself is relatively new, all of its members have lots of experience in the Philippine music scene. Pupil is managed by Day Cabuhat (who also used to handle the Eraserheads) and Ely Buendia's wife, Diane Ventura, who was also manager for [[Ely Buendia#The Mongols|The Mongols]]. 

==History==

[[Image:MONGOL5.jpg|right|thumb|last line-up of "The Mongols" before changing into "Pupil", from upper-left corner then clockwise, Dok Sergio, Yan Yuzon, Bogs Jugo, Jerome Velasco, Ely Buendia.]]
Dok Sergio from the bands [[The Teeth (Filipino band)|The Teeth]] and Daydream Cycle joined [[Ely Buendia#The Mongols|The Mongols']] line-up during the fourth quarter of 2004, making it a five-man band. The Mongols' bassist Yan Yuzon moved to third guitar duties while Dok Sergio handled bass. The transitional five-man line-up was witnessed in The Mongols<U+2019> last single and music video entitled <U+201C>Heroine<U+201D>. In May 2005, [[guitarist]], Jerome Velasco, a.k.a [[J. Astro]], left to pursue a career in producing and [[recording]] [[studio engineer]]ing. The group's last gig under the name "The Mongols" was July 7, 2005.

Velasco<U+2019>s departure shook things up for the group as they were trapped into the decision of whether to stay as a band or not. As they decided to continue and as they progressed, the band noticed that they were producing a different sound without Velasco on the lead guitar and decided to form a "new" band. <U+201C>We got a better bass player and dumber guitarist,<U+201D> jokes guitarist Yan Yuzon, who left bass playing duties to Dok Sergio to take Velasco<U+2019>s place. Upon the determination of forming a <U+201C>new<U+201D> band, the group<U+2019>s first move was to change their name.<ref>http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2005/dec/30/yehey/life/20051230lif1.html</ref>

Frontman Ely Buendia chanced upon the name "Pupil" while browsing a medical book. The band wanted a classic name for a rock band. Before using Pupil, they tried several other names, such as Villain, Lords of Nasdaq, The Gets, Trochlean, Traitors, Tyrel Corp and Narcom. They chose the name Pupil because Buendia liked the fact that it was the part of the eye where light enters. Guitarist Yan Yuzon likes its double meaning, as well as the <U+201C>eternal learning<U+201D> connotations of the name. Pupil's launch gig was on July 13, 2005 at the [[University of the Philippines|UP]] Bahay Ng Alumni. <ref>Legaspi, A. [http://www.gmanews.tv/story/26139/Pupil-Always-willing-to-start-from-scratch "Pupil: Always willing to start from scratch"], ''GMANews.TV''</ref>

Pupil had a hard time searching for a record label. They submitted their demo to several labels, but no one was more enthusiastic about the new material than the newly-merged [[Sony BMG]]. Incidentally, Ely left BMG Pilipinas in 2002 in the wake of his falling out with the [[Eraserheads]]. However, [[BMG]] accepted Buendia again like a "prodigal son," as he himself describes it in their debut album's insert.

The band admits that there is a distinct challenge for them, coming out of their past bands ([[Eraserheads]] and The Teeth). <ref>[http://www.balita.com/entertainment.php?subaction=showfull&id=1137557254&archive=&start_from=&ucat=3& "Coping with a reluctant icon"] ''Balita.com''</ref> The challenge is particularly pronounced on frontman, Ely Buendia, since older fans tend to compare him and his new band with the huge popularity of The Eraserheads before. In an interview by Y. Losorata he says, "I just want my fans and hopefully, my fans to be, to appreciate my music. I<U+2019>m lucky to still have my career in music as a job and as part of Pupil ''wala akong'' (I don't have) delusions to become as big as my previous band was." In fact, the band itself describes their music as actually "one foot in the past, one foot in the present and both eyes dead set at the future." According to Buendia, it's not being there but getting there that's exciting for him, no matter how many times he tries to get there. <ref>Panaligan, J. [http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2006/03/30/ENTR2006033060112.html "Is Pupil being pressured by radio to blink?"], ''The Manila Bulletin Online''</ref>

Local radio stations' reception of Pupil's music, though, is relatively limited (with the exception of [[NU 107]]) due to the band's genre and musical style. While the band's carrier single, "Nasaan Ka?" was played often and achieved quite a popularity among listeners, other singles released from their album encountered more hurdles. Frontman Ely Buendia says, "Some pop radio stations are still making up their minds on "Dianetic" which I personally don<U+2019>t understand since it<U+2019>s really just one of those straightforward love songs ''medyo on the noisy side nga lang'' (just a little bit on the noisy side). "Then again, ''minsan talaga hindi mo maintindihan ang ibang radio stations'' (sometimes you cannot understand some radio stations). It<U+2019>s not as if they don<U+2019>t play songs by foreign artists like [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] with music heavier on distorted electric guitar than ours. ''Pero okay lang'' (But that's okay), that<U+2019>s the reality of things." He speculates that [[colonial mentality]] has something to do about the double standard these radio stations go by. Consequently, they were forced to release an [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] version of their second single, "Dianetic". The acoustic version of "Nasaan Ka?" was then used as a Bonus Track for [[Sony BMG]]'s CD Sampler 2006 Volume 3.

However, the band had relatively early success as evidenced by advertising projects that they were involved with and local awards that they have won. They were featured as the Rising Star for the month of May, 2006 in [[MTV Philippines]]. In the 19th Awit Awards held in Casino Filipino, they won the Award for Best Performance By A New Group Recording Artist/s Category <ref>http://www.awitawards.com.ph/winners2006.html</ref>. They received another award for their first single, "Nasaan Ka?" at the [[MTV Pilipinas]] VMA 2006, bagging the Best Rock Video Award. Then, [[Wrigley's]] [[Juicy Fruit]] chose them as their promotional models for their product along with [[Barbie Almalbis]], another local artist.

In Novermber 26, 2006 Pupil won the [[SOP (Sobrang Okey Pare)|SOP]] Music Awards 2006 Breakthrough Recording Artist of The Year Award. "We don't think Pupil should've qualified as 'breakthrough artist' because this actually is our second album after we changed our name from The Mongols," says Ely. "Honestly, we were rooting for our label mate [[Callalily]] to win."

The band also participated in the 2006 [[MTV]] Staying Alive Music Summit For [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]. Pupil<U+2019>s fourth single, "Gamu-Gamo," quickly climbed [[NU 107]]<U+2019>s Stairway to Seven's number one spot within the first week of 2007. The band also performed a special 8-minute [[Medley (music)|medley]] (which included a cover of the [[Eraserheads]] hit, "Pare Ko") at the 2nd MYX Music Awards which was held on March 15, 2007 at the AFP Theater, Camp Aguinaldo. <ref>http://www.malaya.com.ph/mar24/ente2.htm ''Malaya''</ref>

On July 25, 2007, Yan Yuzon announced in Pupil's mailing list that Bogs Jugo, the band's drummer, left the band to pursue other things for his career. Wendell Garcia, formerly of [[Barbie's Cradle]], replaced Jugo. Garcia played his first gig as the new drummer on July 26, 2007 at the Hard Rock Cafe, Makati. The gig also featured new songs from Pupil's new album that is soon to be released. The Mongols' Jerome Velasco played synths with the band. He is also the band's producer for their second album.

==Discography==
===Beautiful Machines===

''Main article: [[Beautiful Machines]]''

[[Image:Pupil.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Beautiful Machines]]''' album cover]]
[[Beautiful Machines]], Pupil's debut album, was released on November 10, 2005 under [[Sony BMG]], the same music company that publishes [[The Eraserheads|The Eraserheads']] music. The band itself describes their music as "dark, loud, and romantic." Yan Yuzon describes their genre as "everyrock" meaning an amorphous mass of [[rock and roll]], [[Classic rock|classic]] and [[Arena rock|stadium rock]], [[Punk rock|punk]], [[New Wave music|New Wave]], [[glam rock]], [[goth rock]], [[heavy metal]], [[grunge]], and everything in between. It is very guitar-driven, stripped down, and the album has a very distinct sound, considering that it is the band's debut album. The album was recorded digitally at Wombworks in [[Marikina City|Marikina]], the studio founded by Louie Talan of [[Razorback (band)|Razorback]]. <U+201C>We didn<U+2019>t use amps at all,<U+201D> Buendia says. The album was mastered at Tweak Merville by Zach Lucero, drummer of the band, Imago. <ref>http://www.sonymusic.ph/albums.asp?Key=313&cat=82876764352</ref>

===Hoodwinked Soundtrack===

An instrumental version of the song was played in the background of the Granny Xtreme skiing scene. The film's soundtrack was released under [[Rykodisc]]. Most animations and visuals of Hoodwinked were created and processed at Digital Eye Candy, [[Makati City]]. <ref>http://vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&code=81bd144f&atype=articles&id=2092</ref> One of the head animators behind the Hoodwinked team, Gorio Vicuna, is the one who designed and directed the album cover and sleeve layout of "[[Beautiful Machines]]<U+201D> album. <ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20060108190507/pupilopolis.com/bulletinboard.php</ref>

[[Image:Barbie and pupi fudge.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Pupil and Barbie Almalbis (center) playing ''Nakakabaliw'' at the Streetscape EDSA Shangri-La Plaza]]
Pupil and [[Barbie Almalbis]] were chosen by Juicy Fruit as their advertising models to reach out to the younger generation in their Rockoustic Mania advertising events. The promotion included Juicy Fruit's Tugtog Mo! band competition, and Style mo! competition by Human and [[Pony International|Pony footwear]]. The collaboration between the two artists offers a fusion of [[Rock music|Rock]] and [[Acoustic music|Acoustic]]. The [[Video CD|AVCD]] features two songs, the music videos and some behind the scenes look at the artists' works. It was released on August 24, 2006.

The [[Juicy Fruit]] Rockoustic Mania Final Fusion event was held on November 17, at the Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas (Folk Arts Theater), [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]]. The show featured performances from Barbie Almalbis and Pupil, guest bands [[Sugarfree (band)|Sugarfree]] and [[Up Dharma Down]], and of course, from the three finalists, WTC 11, Medea, and 7th Skool.

During the Rockoustic Mania Press Launch at Phi Bar Metrowalk held on June 14, 2006, [[Barbie Almalbis]] and Pupil played their songs separately as they showed the crowd their own music styles and genre. They also jammed together and as a bonus, Barbie sang the [[Eraserheads]] classic <U+201C>Overdrive<U+201D> and on the other hand, <U+201C>Alapaap<U+201D> was performed by Pupil.

===Animax===
Pupil also made a new theme song for Animax Asia, entitled "Set Me Apart". The song had its exclusive Philippine-radio launch by [[NU 107|NU107]]. <ref>http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view_article.php?article_id=56050</ref> The song also gained no.1 spot in NU 107's Stairway to Seven chart within just two weeks after the radio launch.

Pupil had been part of [[ANIMAX|Animax]] Fashion-Ability event, where they made special appearance at the event, played their music, and talked about their fashion style. <ref>http://www.animax-asia.com/corporate/press15.asp</ref> The band's first onstage public appearance after [[Ely Buendia#Health|Ely<U+2019>s heart attack]] was also with Animax. It was on Saturday, February 10, 2007 when the band performed at The Music Hall in SM [[Mall of Asia]], in an [[Animax]] [[speed-dating]] and welcome celebration for [[Valentine<U+2019>s Day]] event called <U+201C>Love Is In The Air<U+201D>. The band was also featured (along with [[Sponge Cola]] and [[Urbandub]]) in a show called [[Music Station|MUSIC STATION]], which also airs on Animax.

The song had its official local launch Tuesday, May 22, 2007 in an exclusive Animax Party at the [http://www.hardrock.com/locations/cafes3/cafes.aspx?LocationID=19&MenuID=15&MIBEnumID=3 Hard Rock Cafe Makati], wherein 50 pairs of tickets were given away in a contest. The band had their first overseas gig on the 27th of May at the Bar None bar in [[Marriott Hotels|Marriott Hotel]], [[Orchard Road]], [[Singapore]]. The [[Singaporean citizenship|Singaporean]]-act [http://www.audioreload.com/node/4187 The Great Spy Experiment] opened for that night's "Bar None Rock Affair" gig. <ref>http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:I4BTQK_5F28J:www.barnoneasia.com/+barnoneasia.com&hl=tl&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=ph&client=firefox-a ''Barnone Asia website, Google cached version''</ref> <ref>http://www.animax-asia.com/pupil/contest/default2.asp ''Animax Asia - Pupil''</ref> An interview with the band was aired on Friday, June 1, 2007 and Pupil was interviewed on Animax's "Music Talk" by Francis "Brew" Reyes of [[The Dawn (band)|The Dawn]]. The [[Asia]]-wide launching of the music video of "Set Me Apart" was aired on June 8, 2007 at exactly 7pm on Animax. The music video features the band as "live" [[anime]]-styled characters, like [[cosplayers]]. <ref>http://www.animax-asia.com/pupil/contest/ ''Animax Asia - Pupil Bar None''</ref>

Each member of the band have had their own [[Anime]] depictions and concepts as well. Each concept represents the diversity of different worlds that subsist within the whole Anime universe. Ely exists in a [[post-apocalyptic]] outer space territory similar to [[Mobile Suit Gundam]] and [[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]. Yan is a western gunman fighting misdemeanour, comparable to [[Cowboy Bebop]]. Dok resides in a [[Zen]]-like shogunate era, full of tranquillity and close to nature, while Bogs stays engaged within a busy urban core area. Each <U+201C>world<U+201D> used distinctive video transitions that greatly bear a resemblance to the human eye or <U+201C>[[Pupil]]<U+201D>.

The production of the music video is a first of its kind for a Filipino band, most scenes and characters were done using traditional hand-drawn [[2D geometric model|2D]] animation subsequently softly blended with [[3D computer graphics|3D]] and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. One of the famous anime films that used this technique is [[Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence]], which is also a personal favourite of Ely (as evident with The Mongols' "Case Logic" lyrics and interviews)

===Wild Life===

''Main article: [[Wild Life (Pupil album)|Wild Life]]''
