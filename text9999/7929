'''Triple X''' was a wrestling [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]] in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]]. The team consisted of [[Christopher Daniels]], [[Elix Skipper]], and [[Brandon Silvestry|Low Ki]] (later known as Senshi). The team was originally formed in late 2002 as part of [[Vince Russo]]'s [[Sports Entertainment Xtreme]] superstable.<ref name="s.e.x."/> [[Christopher Daniels|Daniels]], the leader of this group, was a part of it during all of its runs until November 11, 2007.

==History==
===First Run (2002-2003)===
Triple X began as a team under Vince Russo's "Sports Entertainment Xtreme" faction.<ref name="s.e.x.">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/s-e-x.html|title=Sports Entertainment Xtreme's Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> They began teaming on December 18, 2002 defeating the team of [[Amazing Red]] and [[The S.A.T.]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tna/021218.html|title=NWA-TNA PPV: December 18, 2002|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> One of the unique trends begun by Triple X was the "Triple X Rule" (which is precedented by the earlier [[Fabulous Freebirds#Freebird Rule|Freebird Rule]]). When Low Ki and Elix Skipper won the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] on January 22, 2003, from [[America's Most Wanted (professional wrestling)|America's Most Wanted]] ([[Chris Harris (wrestler)|Chris Harris]] and [[James Storm]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tna/030122.html|title=NWA-TNA PPV: January 22, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref><ref name="worldtagteam">{{cite web|url=http://www.nwawrestling.com/PHP-Nuke/modules.php?name=Encyclopedia&op=content&tid=92|title=NWA World Tag Team Championship official title history|publisher=NWA Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> TNA officials permitted them to allow Christopher Daniels to defend the title as well. Before each tag team match, all three members of Triple X would stand in the ring, and only when the bell rang would it be known which two of the three would be competing.

They made the first title defense on February 5 PPV against [[Disciples of the New Church]] ([[Brian Lee]] and [[Kelly Wolfe|Slash]]) which ended in a [[Dusty finish|double pin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tna/030205.html|title=NWA-TNA PPV: February 5, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> As a result of this double pin, they were stripped of the titles.<ref name="worldtagteam"/> On the March 12 PPV, they defeated America's Most Wanted to begin their second NWA World Tag Team Championship reign.<ref name="worldtagteam"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tna/030312.html|title=NWA-TNA PPV: March 12, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> They began feuding with both Disciples of the New Church and America's Most Wanted over the titles. However, they lost the titles to [[Jerry Lynn]] and The Amazing Red on April 16.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tna/030416.html|title=NWA-TNA PPV: April 16, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref>

On May 7, Christopher Daniels became the first ever solo holder of the NWA World Tag Team Championship. He won a handicap match with then-champions [[Amazing Red]] and [[Jerry Lynn]] by disqualification (at the time in TNA, championships could change hands by countout or DQ).<ref name="worldtagteam"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tna/030507.html|title=NWA-TNA PPV: May 7, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> They used their "[[Fabulous Freebirds#Freebird Rule|Triple X Rule]]" to allow Elix Skipper to defend with him. During this time, Triple X began their now-legendary feud against America's Most Wanted, becoming the only team in TNA history to maintain regular success against the most dominant tag team in TNA history. This included the first cage match in TNA history, in which America's Most Wanted finally scored a win against Triple X for the NWA World Tag Team Championship on June 25.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tna/030625.html|title=NWA-TNA PPV: June 25, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref>

After Low Ki left TNA in July 2003, Triple X parted ways the next month and both Daniels and Skipper focused on singles careers. However, they had a short lived reunion in January 2004.

===Second Run (2004)===
In March, Daniels brought in Low Ki as a surprise partner for the vacant NWA World Tag Team Championship Tournament, in which they defeated The New Franchise ([[Matt Bentley|Michael Shane]] and [[Shane Douglas]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tna/040324.html|title=NWA-TNA PPV: March 24, 2004|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> and [[The Naturals]] ([[Andy Douglas]] and [[Chase Stevens]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tna/040331.html|title=NWA-TNA PPV: March 31, 2004|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> before losing the finals to [[Kid Kash]] and [[Lance Hoyt|Dallas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tna/040407.html|title=NWA-TNA PPV: April 7, 2004|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> Afterwards, Low Ki disappeared from TNA again.

On May 26, 2004, Daniels and Skipper were reunited as members of [[Team USA|Team NWA]] for the [[TNA 2004 America's/World X Cup Tournament#World X Cup|World X Cup]], which pitted teams from the NWA, [[All Japan Pro Wrestling|Japan]], [[Asistencia Asesor<U+00ED>a y Administraci<U+00F3>n|Mexico]] and [[Border City Wrestling|Canada]] against one another in a series of matches for points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tna/040526.html|title=2004 World X Cup results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> With the assistance of Daniels' and Skipper's Triple X teamwork, Team NWA was successful at winning the 2004 World X Cup.

After helping Team NWA win the World X Cup, Daniels ended up injuring his shoulder in Japan. After returning a month later, Daniels and Skipper stayed together, this time officially reuniting as Triple X. They went after the NWA Tag Team belts once more, this time in a feud involving long-term enemies America's Most Wanted and The Naturals. In an ironic twist of fate, they would each win the belts separately with members of their sworn enemies, America's Most Wanted. Elix Skipper and [[Chris Harris (wrestler)|Chris Harris]] won the titles from The Naturals on September 8,<ref name="worldtagteam"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tna/040908.html|title=NWA-TNA PPV: September 8, 2004|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> but were beaten by Daniels and [[James Storm]] on September 21 tapings of ''[[TNA Impact!|Impact!]]'',<ref name="worldtagteam"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tnaimpact/040924.html|title=iMPACT! results - September 24, 2004|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> who held them until losing to [[Team Canada (TNA)|Team Canada]]'s [[Robert Roode|Bobby Roode]] and [[Eric Young (wrestler)|Eric Young]] on October 12.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tna/041015.html|title=iMPACT! results - October 15, 2004|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref>

After that loss, the feud restarted in earnest, leading to a [[Professional wrestling match types#Last Man Standing match|Last Team Standing match]] at TNA's first three-hour monthly pay-per-view [[TNA Victory Road (2004)|Victory Road 2004]]. AMW went on to win the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/victoryroad.htm|title=Victory Road 2004 review|publisher=Gerweck.net|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> The two teams met each other in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|Six Sides of Steel match]] at [[TNA Turning Point (2004)|Turning Point 2004]], a rematch of an August 2003 steel cage encounter, where the losing team was forced to disband. In a match that saw Elix Skipper do the now-legendary [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Frankensteiner|cagewalk rana]], AMW got the win when they handcuffed Daniels to a corner and put the Power-Plex<U+2014>Triple X's own finisher<U+2014>on Skipper. Due to the loss, Triple X was disbanded and Daniels and Skipper could not tag together again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/turningpoint.htm|title=Turning Point 2004 review|publisher=Gerweck.net|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref>

===Split===
Following the split at the end of Turning Point, both Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper pursued singles careers in TNA. Daniels achieved success early on, winning the [[TNA X Division Championship]] at [[TNA Destination X#2005|Destination X 2005]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/destinationx.htm|title=Destination X 2005 review|publisher=Gerweck.net|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref><ref name="xdivision">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/tna/tna-x.html|title=T.N.A.

Styles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/unbreakable.htm|title=Unbreakable review|publisher=Gerweck.net|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> Daniels later regained the belt in an [[Ultimate X]] match at [[TNA Destination X#2006|Destination X 2006]] against Samoa Joe and Styles,<ref name="xdivision"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/destinationx06.htm|title=Destination X 2006 review|publisher=Gerweck.net|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> but soon after he lost the belt to Joe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tnaimpact/060413.html|title=iMPACT! results - April 13, 2006|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> Daniels regained the TNA X Division Championship one more time in a three-way match against Styles and [[Chris Sabin]],<ref name="xdivision"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tnaimpact/061116.html|title=iMPACT! results - November 16, 2006|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> before losing it just weeks later to Sabin at [[TNA Final Resolution#2007|Final Resolution 2007]] in another three-way match which included [[Jerry Lynn]].<ref name="Final Resolution 2007 review">{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/finalresolution07.htm|title=Final Resolution 2007 review|publisher=Gerweck.net|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref>

Apart from a strong showing early, Skipper met with limited success, and was quickly recruited into [[Simon Diamond]]'s [[Diamonds in the Rough]] stable. From there, he proceeded to team with Diamond and [[David Young (wrestler)|David Young]] until the team was eventually phased out by TNA and Skipper was eventually released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/profiles/e/elix-skipper.html|title=Elix Skipper's Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref>

Low Ki returned to TNA in April 2006 at the [[Lockdown (2006)|Lockdown 2006]] pay per view as a surprise competitor. His opponent was none other than his former teammate, Christopher Daniels, who was originally scheduled to face [[Jushin Liger]] before the latter was forced to pull out of the event. Ki, now utilizing the name "Senshi", which translates directly from [[Japanese language|Japanese]] to "Warrior," defeated Daniels<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/lockdown06.htm|title=Lockdown 2006 review|publisher=Gerweck.net|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> before eventually going on to win the X Division championship just after [[Slammiversary (2006)|Slammiversary 2006]] in a three-way match against champion [[Samoa Joe]] and [[Sonjay Dutt]].<ref name="xdivision"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tnaimpact/060622.html|title=iMPACT! results - June 22, 2006|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> After Senshi lost the belt to [[Chris Sabin]] at [[Bound for Glory (2006)]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/boundforglory06.htm|title=Bound For Glory 2006 review|publisher=Gerweck.net|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> he faded into the background, participating in the Paparazzi Championship Series through the remainder of 2006 and early 2007. He went on to defeat [[Austin Aries|Austin Starr]] at [[TNA Final Resolution#2007|Final Resolution 2007]].<ref name="Final Resolution 2007 review"/>

===Reunion / Third Run (2007-2008)===
At [[TNA Victory Road#2007|Victory Road 2007]], Triple X officially reunited when Senshi and the returning Skipper helped Daniels win the [[Ultimate X match]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/victoryroad07.htm|title=Victory Road 2007 review|publisher=Gerweck.net|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> It was explained on the July 19, 2007 edition of [[TNA Today]] that since Skipper had been released and then resigned by TNA, that the stipulation of he and Daniels never teaming again was null and void. They won their return match against [[Raven's Nest#Serotonin|Serotonin]] on the July 19 episode of ''Impact''!.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tnaimpact/070719.html|title=iMPACT! results - July 19, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> They followed their victory up on the August 2 episode of ''Impact!'', where Daniels and Senshi defeated "Black Machismo" [[Jay Lethal]] and [[Sonjay Dutt]] with the help of Elix Skipper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tnaimpact/070802.html|title=iMPACT! results - August 2, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> After the match, there was a brief confrontation between them and [[The Motor City Machine Guns]] (Chris Sabin and Alex Shelley). Daniels and Senshi teamed together at [[TNA Hard Justice#2007|Hard Justice 2007]] to take on Jay Lethal and Sonjay Dutt and The Motor City Machine Guns in a triple threat match where Daniels was rolled up by Lethal taking the loss.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/hardjustice07.htm|title=Hard Justice 2007 review|publisher=Gerweck.net|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> On the following episode of ''Impact!'' Daniels' X Division Title shot was put on the line against Lethal which he lost after Lethal pinned him with the Lethal Combination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tnaimpact/070816.html|title=iMPACT! results - August 16, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref>

On September 13 edition of ''Impact!'', Daniels would end up winning the bout over the champion Jay Lethal in a non-title match and being rewarded with a X Division Title match at Bound for Glory against Lethal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tnaimpact/070913.html|title=iMPACT! results - September 13, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> At [[Bound for Glory (2007)]], Daniels would lose the match against Lethal after a top rope Lethal Combination. On the same show Skipper and Senshi faced LAX in a number one contender's match for the TNA World Tag Team Titles in an Ultimate X match. They would also lose their match on the show as Hernandez would retrieve the X for LAX after a Border Toss of Skipper onto Senshi on the outside of the ring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/boundforglory07.htm|title=Bound For Glory 2007 review|publisher=Gerweck.net|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref>

Christopher Daniels and Senshi were sent to [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] to represent TNA in a series of matches at Destruction 2007. They were able to defeat Prince Devitt and Minoru in a tag team match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/newjapan/sumo10.html#111107|title=Destruction 2007 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref>

[[Brandon Silvestry|Senshi]] left TNA thus ending the tag team. Daniels was then [[kayfabe]] fired via the 'Feast or Fired' stipulation, but then appeared under his Curry Man gimmick before being [[kayfabe]] fired yet again at the next year's 'Feast or Fired'.  He was previously portraying the role of 'Suicide' while [[Frankie Kazarian|Kaz]] was injured, and has since returned to his 'Fallen Angel' gimmick. Skipper rarely appeared from then on and was soon after released.
