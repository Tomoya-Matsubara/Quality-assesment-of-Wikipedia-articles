"'''Say Something'''" is originally a song by American pop duo [[A Great Big World]], released as the lead-single from their debut album, ''[[Is There Anybody Out There? (album)|Is There Anybody Out There?]]'' (2013). Originally being released as a solo single from band member [[Ian Axel]]'s solo album ''This Is the New Year'' in 2011, the song was released as a single by the band on September 3, 2013, via [[Epic Records]]. Following its usage on American reality TV show ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (United States)|So You Think You Can Dance]]'', the track gained attention from singer [[Christina Aguilera]], who wanted to work with them on the song. Quickly afterwards, Aguilera appeared on the re-recorded version of "Say Something", released on November 4, 2013.

Composed by Ian Axel, Chad Vaccarino and Mike Campbell, "Say Something" is a [[downtempo]] [[indie pop]] [[piano ballad]] which talks about a breakup, where the lover is implored to make a statement that could potentially reverse plans, with the singers expressing humility, sadness and regret. In the single version with Aguilera, she plays a ghost of the lover to whom the song is addressed as she traces the steps of the lead vocal. The song was critically praised for its powerful lyrics, the emotional composition and Aguilera's vocal delivery.

"Say Something" did not sell significantly until the re-recorded version was available; it debuted at number 16 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart after A Great Big World and Aguilera performed the song on ''The Voice'', while eventually peaking at number four. It also topped the singles charts in Australia, Belgium, and Canada. A music video was released on November 19, 2013. It features the trio singing as people "act out the heartbreaking lyrics." To further promote "Say Something", A Great Big World performed the track on ''[[The Voice (U.S. season 5)|The Voice]]'' and at the [[American Music Awards of 2013]] with Aguilera.

==Background and release==
"Say Something" was originally released on February 8, 2011 on band member Ian Axel's solo album ''This Is the New Year'' with the song featuring harmonies by guest vocalist Jenny Owen Youngs, but the track went largely unnoticed until it received attention after being used on the TV series ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (United States)|So You Think You Can Dance]]'' on [[So You Think You Can Dance (U.S. season 10)#Week 10 (September 3, 2013)|season 10's semi final episode]] contemporary dance routine by the eventual champion Amy Yakima. This sparked a chain reaction that eventually made its way to [[Christina Aguilera]].<ref name="billboardinterview">{{cite news|last=Lipshut|first=Jason|title=A Great Big World Talks 'Say Something' & Answering Christina Aguilera's Call|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5778275/a-great-big-world-talks-say-something-answering-christina|accessdate=November 10, 2013|newspaper=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=November 6, 2013}}</ref> "'Say Something' was danced to on ''So You Think You Can Dance'' almost two months ago, and so many people responded to it," Axel tells Billboard. "In that whole process, someone on our team played it for someone on Christina's team, and we got a call that Christina wanted to record it, and then, literally a week later, we were in L.A. recording it with her."<ref name="billboardinterview" /> The pair considers Aguilera's set of pipes "one of the top voices in the world," says Chad Vaccarino, and re-recorded "Say Something" with her in two hours. "We look at Christina as this icon who can say anything and make it sound amazing," says Vaccarino.<ref name="billboardinterview" />

About approaching to the duo to re-record the track, Aguilera said, "Somebody sent me the song (...) and it's just the most simplest song that doesn't have to fit a formula to be heard and to be appreciated, so I just heard it and I've never done anything like this before and I was just like, 'You know', I just started to hear a harmony part over it and I was like, 'get in touch with these guys and see if they wanna get in the studio and sit behind the piano and just vibe together and see what happens...' and we did, and they're so humble, so sweet, so down to earth, and I'm all about that and supporting that, and we came together so organically and it was fun."<ref name="access">{{cite news|title=Christina Aguilera Talks Collaborating on Say Something; Blake Shelton on His Mom Putting Him in Beauty Pageants|url=http://watch.accesshollywood.com/video/christina-aguilera-talks-collaborating-on-say-something-blake-shelton-on-his-mom-putting-him-in-beauty-pageants/2820428278001|accessdate=November 10, 2013|newspaper=[[Access Hollywood]]}}</ref> Aguilera also added, "It's so quiet and still and steady and in a way pleading," she describes the song.

For Bill Lamb of ''[[About.com]]'', the chorus "Say something, I'm giving up on you", "is brilliant."<ref name="about.com" /> Lamb also explained the song, writing that, "instead of being filled with anger and desperation, it is a song expressing a powerful combination of humility, sadness and regret."<ref name="about.com" /> The song was written at a time when both members were experiencing individual heartbreak. "Writing the song was part of the healing process," says Axel. "Whenever we perform it, it's like revisiting the scar. It's always a part of me, and I can always go there and feel it."<ref name="billboardinterview" /> Lewis Corner of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' noted that with its "stripped-down melody and emotive lyrics", the song becomes the antithesis of the club-thumping blow-outs radio currently prefers."<ref name="digitalspyreview" />

==Critical response==
[[File:Ian Axel and Chad Vaccarino at Bowery Ballroom May 2011.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The personal lyrics, written by the band members (''pictured''), were highly praised by critics.]]
"Say Something" received universal acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. Bill Lamb of ''[[About.com]]'' gave the song 4.5 out of 5 stars, praising its "powerful lyrics, Aguilera's delicate vocals added to the mix" and the "emotional piano and strings arrangement," pointing out that, "At a time in which pop music is lacking in emotional ballads, 'Say Something' sounds just right." Lamb also praised Aguilera for "adding a unique resonance sounding almost as if she is the ghost of the lover to whom the song is addressed as she traces the steps of the lead vocal." Lamb also praised her for "keeping the power of her voice in check and instead sings delicately with a breathy tone of loss."<ref name="about.com" /> Rick Florino of ''[[Artist Direct]]'' gave the song 5 out of 5 stars, writing that the song is "[[Academy Award|Oscar]]-worthy", with "a cinematic heft to the track that makes it utterly vivid and vibrant."

===Reception===
[[File:xtinasaysomethingvideo.png|thumb|right|220px|The scene where [[Christina Aguilera]] is shown with tears welling in her eyes was praised by critics and fans alike due to her delivery.]]
The video received widespread acclaim from critics, due to its simplicity and honesty. For Jason Lipshut of ''[[Billboard Magazine]]'', "Aguilera and AGBW's Ian Axel look utterly sorrowful as they croon the break-up ballad together, with Axel carefully pounding away at the grand piano and Aguilera appearing on the verge of tears as the song reaches its climax. Meanwhile, various tear-inducing images accompany the majestic track, often in slow motion <U+2013> most strikingly, an older man climbing into a hospital bed with his peaceful female counterpart and emitting a silent shout."<ref name="billboardvideo">{{cite news|last=Lipshut|first=Jason|title=A Great Big World, Christina Aguilera Shine In 'Say Something' Video: Watch|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5793380/a-great-big-world-christina-aguilera-shine-in-say-something-video?utm_source=twitter|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=<nowiki>Billboard]]</nowiki>|date=November 20, 2013}}</ref> Peter Gicas of ''[[E!
