'''Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis''' ('''CVST''') is a rare form of [[thrombosis]] (a blood clot) affecting the [[dural venous sinuses]] which drain blood from the [[brain]]. Symptoms may include [[headache]], abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of [[stroke]] such as weakness of the face and limbs on one side of the body, and seizures. Treatment is with [[anticoagulant]]s (medication that suppresses blood clotting). The disease may be complicated by raised intracranial pressure, which may warrant surgical intervention such as the placement of a shunt.<ref name=Stam2005>{{cite journal |author=Stam J |title=Thrombosis of the cerebral veins and sinuses |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=352 |issue=17 |pages=1791<U+2013>8 |year=2005 |pmid=15858188 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra042354}}</ref> There are several other terms for the condition, such as '''cerebral venous ''and'' sinus thrombosis''', '''(superior) sagittal sinus thrombosis''', '''dural sinus thrombosis''' and '''intracranial venous thrombosis'''.

==Signs and symptoms==
===Clinical presentation===
Nine in ten people with sinus thrombosis have a headache; this tends to worsen over the period of several days, but may also develop suddenly ([[thunderclap headache]]).<ref name=Stam2005/> The headache may be the only symptom of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.<ref name=Cumurciuc2005>{{cite journal |author=Cumurciuc R, Crassard I, Sarov M, Valade D, Bousser MG |title=Headache as the only neurological sign of cerebral venous thrombosis: a series of 17 cases |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. |volume=76 |issue=8 |pages=1084<U+2013>7 |year=2005 |pmid=16024884 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2004.056275 |url=http://jnnp.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/76/8/1084}}</ref> Many patients have symptoms of stroke: inability to move one or more limbs, weakness on one side of the face or [[aphasia|difficulty speaking]]. This does not necessarily affect one side of the body as in the more common "arterial" stroke.<ref name=Stam2005/>

40% of all patients have [[seizure]]s, although it is commoner still in women before and after birth.<ref name=EFNS>{{cite journal |author=Einh<U+00E4>upl K, Bousser MG, de Bruijn SF, ''et al'' |title=EFNS guideline on the treatment of cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis |journal=Eur. J. Neurol. |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=553<U+2013>9 |year=2006 |pmid=16796579 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-1331.2006.01398.x}}</ref>), mostly [[Focal seizures|affecting only one part of the body]] and [[unilateral]] but often [[Tonic-clonic seizure|generalised]] and sometimes leading to [[status epilepticus]] (persistent seizure activity for a long period of time).<ref name=Stam2005/>

In the elderly, many of the aforementioned symptoms may not occur. Common symptoms in the elderly with this condition are otherwise unexplained changes in [[mental status]] and a depressed level of consciousness.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ferro JM, Canh<U+00E3>o P, Bousser MG, Stam J, Barinagarrementeria F |title=Cerebral vein and dural sinus thrombosis in elderly patients |journal=Stroke |volume=36 |issue=9 |pages=1927<U+2013>32 |year=2005 |pmid=16100024 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000177894.05495.54}}</ref>

The [[intracranial pressure]] (pressure around the brain) may rise, causing [[papilledema|papilloedema]] (swelling of the [[optic disc]]) which may be experienced as visual obscurations. In severely raised intracranial pressure, the level of consciousness is decreased, the [[blood pressure]] rises, the [[bradycardia|heart rate falls]] and the patient assumes an abnormal posture.<ref name=Stam2005/>

===Risk factors===
Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is more common in particular situations. 85% of patients have at least one of these risk factors:<ref name=Stam2005/>
* [[Thrombophilia]], a tendency to develop blood clots due to abnormalities in coagulation, e.g. [[factor V Leiden]], deficiency of [[protein C]], [[protein S]] or [[antithrombin]], or related problems
* [[Nephrotic syndrome]], a kidney problem causing protein loss in the urine
* Chronic inflammatory diseases, such as [[inflammatory bowel disease]], [[Lupus erythematosus|lupus]] and [[Beh<U+00E7>et's disease]]
* [[Pregnancy]] and [[puerperium]] (the period after giving birth)
* Particular blood disorders, especially [[polycythemia vera]] and [[paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]]
* Use of the [[contraceptive pill]]
* [[Meningitis]] and infections of the ear, nose and throat area such as [[mastoiditis]] and [[sinusitis]]
* Direct injury to the venous sinuses
* Medical procedures in the head and neck area

==Diagnosis==
===Investigations===
The diagnosis may be suspected on the basis of the symptoms, for example the combination of headache, signs of raised [[intercranial pressure]] and focal neurological abnormalities, or when alternative causes of headache and neurological abnormalities, such as a [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]], have been excluded.<ref name=Stam2005/>

;CT, MRI and angiography
[[Image:Sagital sinus thrombus.JPG|thumb|rigtht|200px| CT Scan showing a filling defect in the Sagital sinus]]
There are various [[neuroimaging]] investigations that may detect cerebral sinus thrombosis. [[Cerebral oedema]] and venous infarction may be apparent on any modality, but for the detection of the thrombus itself, the most commonly used tests are [[computed tomography]] (CT) and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), both using various types of radiocontrast to perform a [[venogram]] and visualise the veins around the brain.<ref name=Stam2005/>

[[Computed tomography]], with [[radiocontrast]] in the venous phase (''CT venography'' or CTV), has a detection rate that in some regards exceeds that of MRI. The test involves injection into a vein (usually in the arm) of a radioopaque substance, and time is allowed for the bloodstream to carry it to the cerebral veins - at which point the scan is performed. It has a [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] of 75-100% (it detects 75-100% of all clots present), and a [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] of 81-100% (it would be incorrectly positive in 0-19%). In the first two weeks, the "empty delta sign" may be observed (in later stages, this sign may disappear).<ref name=Smith2007>{{cite journal |author=Smith R, Hourihan MD |title=Investigating suspected cerebral venous thrombosis |journal=BMJ |volume=334 |issue=7597 |pages=794<U+2013>5 |year=2007 |pmid=17431266 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39154.636968.47 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/334/7597/794}}</ref>

[[Magnetic resonance angiography|Magnetic resonance venography]] employs the same principles, but uses MRI as a scanning modality. MRI has the advantage of being better at detecting damage to the brain itself as a result of the increased pressure on the obstructed veins, but it is not readily available in many hospitals and the interpretation may be difficult.<ref name=Smith2007/>

[[Cerebral angiography]] may demonstrate smaller clots than CT or MRI, and obstructed veins may give the "corkscrew appearance".<ref name=Stam2005/> This, however, requires puncture of the [[femoral artery]] with a sheath and advancing a thin tube through the blood vessels to the brain where radiocontrast is injected before X-ray images are obtained. It is therefore only performed if all other tests give unclear results or when other treatments may be administered during the same procedure.

;D-dimer
A 2004 study suggested that the [[D-dimer]] blood test, already in use for the diagnosis of other forms of thrombosis, was abnormal (above 500 <U+03BC>g/l) in 34 out of 35 patients with cerebral sinus thrombosis, giving it a [[sensitivity (test)|sensitivity]] of 97.1%, a [[negative predictive value]] of 99.6%, a [[specificity (test)|specificity]] of 91.2%, and a positive predictive value of 55.7%. Furthermore, the level of the D-dimer correlated with the extent of the thrombosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kosinski CM, Mull M, Schwarz M, ''et al'' |title=Do normal D-dimer levels reliably exclude cerebral sinus thrombosis? |journal=Stroke |volume=35 |issue=12 |pages=2820<U+2013>5 |year=2004 |pmid=15514174 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000147045.71923.18 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/35/12/2820}}</ref> A subsequent study, however,  showed that 10% of patients with confirmed thrombosis had a normal D-dimer, and in those who had presented with only a headache 26% had a normal D-dimer. The study concludes that D-dimer is not useful in the situations where it would make the most difference, namely in lower probability cases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Crassard I, Soria C, Tzourio C, ''et al'' |title=A negative D-dimer assay does not rule out cerebral venous thrombosis: a series of seventy-three patients |journal=Stroke |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=1716<U+2013>9 |year=2005 |pmid=16020765 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000173401.76085.98 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/36/8/1716}}</ref>

===Further tests===
In most patients, the direct cause for the cerebral sinus thrombosis is not readily apparent. Identifying a source of infection is crucial, but it is common practice to screen for various forms of [[thrombophilia]] (a propensity to form blood clots).<ref name=Stam2005/>

==Pathogenesis==
The [[vein]]s of the brain, both the superficial veins and the deep venous system, empty into the dural venous sinuses, which carry blood back to the [[jugular vein]] and thence to the [[heart]]. In cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, blood clots usually form both in the veins of the brain and the venous sinuses. The thrombosis of the veins themselves causes [[cerebral edema|cerebral oedema]] (both ''vasogenic'' and ''cytotoxic'' oedema) through [[back pressure]], and lead to small [[petechia]]l haemorrhages that may merge into large haematomas. Thrombosis of the sinuses is the main mechanism behind the increase in intracranial pressure due to decreased resorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The condition does not lead to [[hydrocephalus]], however, because there is no difference in pressure between various parts of the brain.<ref name=Stam2005/>

Any blood clot forms due to an imbalance between [[coagulation]] (the formation of the insoluble blood protein [[fibrin]]) and [[fibrinolysis]]. The three major mechanisms for such an imbalance are enumerated in [[Virchow's triad]]: alterations in normal blood flow, injury to the blood vessel wall, and alterations in the constitution of blood (hypercoagulability). Most cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are due to hypercoagulability.<ref name=Stam2005/>

It is possible for the clot to break off and migrate ([[embolism|embolise]]) to the [[lung]]s, causing a [[pulmonary embolism]].<ref name=Stam2005/><ref name=EFNS/> An analysis of earlier case reports concludes that this occurs in about 10% of cases, but has a very poor prognosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Diaz JM, Schiffman JS, Urban ES, Maccario M |title=Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: a syndrome rediscovered |journal=Acta Neurol. Scand. |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=390<U+2013>6 |year=1992 |pmid=1455986}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Various studies have investigated the use of [[anticoagulation]] to suppress blood clot formation in cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Before these trials had been conducted, there had been a concern that small areas of hemorrhage in the brain would bleed further as a result of treatment; the studies showed that this concern was unfounded. The [[European Federation of Neurological Societies]] (EFNS), in their 2006 [[clinical practice guideline]], recommends [[heparin]] or [[low molecular weight heparin]] in the initial treatment, followed by [[warfarin]], provided there are no other bleeding risks that would make these treatments unsuitable.<ref name=EFNS/> The duration of warfarin treatment depends on the circumstances and underlying causes of the condition. If the thrombosis developed under temporary circumstances (e.g. pregnancy), three months are regarded as sufficient. If the condition was unprovoked but there are no clear causes or a "mild" form of thrombophilia, 6 to 12 months is advised. If there is a severe underlying thrombosis disorder, warfarin treatment may need to continue indefinitely.<ref name=EFNS/>

[[Thrombolysis]] (removal of the blood clot with "clot buster" medication) has been described, either systemically by injection into a vein or directly into the clot during angiography. The 2006 EFNS guideline recommends that thrombolysis is only used in patients who deteriorate despite adequate treatment, and other causes of deterioration have been eliminated. It is unclear which drug and which mode of administration is the most effective. Bleeding into the brain and in other sites of the body is a major concern in the use of thrombolysis.<ref name=EFNS/>

Raised intracranial pressure, if severe or threatening vision, may require therapeutic [[lumbar puncture]] (removal of excessive [[cerebrospinal fluid]]), medication ([[acetazolamide]]), or [[neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] treatment (optic nerve sheath fenestration or shunting).<ref name=Stam2005/> In certain situations, [[anticonvulsant]]s may be used to prevent seizures; these are focal neurological problems (e.g. inability to move a limb) and/or focal changes of the brain tissue on CT or MRI scan.<ref name=EFNS/>

==Prognosis==
In 2004 the first adequately large scale study on the natural history and long-term prognosis of this condition was reported; this showed that at 16 months follow-up 57.1% of patients had full recovery, 29.5%/2.9%/2.2% had respectively minor/moderate/severe symptoms or impairments, and 8.3% had died. Severe impairment or death were more likely in those aged over 37 years, male, affected by coma, mental status disorder, intracerebral hemorrhage, thrombosis of the deep cerebral venous system, central nervous system infection and cancer.<ref name="pmid14976332">{{cite journal |author=Ferro JM, Canh<U+00E3>o P, Stam J, Bousser MG, Barinagarrementeria F |title=Prognosis of cerebral vein and dural sinus thrombosis: results of the International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus Thrombosis (ISCVT) |journal=Stroke |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=664<U+2013>70 |year=2004 |pmid=14976332 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000117571.76197.26 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/35/3/664}}</ref> A subsequent [[systematic review]] of nineteen studies in 2006 showed that mortality is about 5.6% during hospitalisation and 9.4% in total, while of the survivors 88% make a total or near-total recovery. After several months, two thirds of the cases has resolution ("recanalisation") of the clot. The rate of recurrence was low (2.8%).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dentali F, Gianni M, Crowther MA, Ageno W |title=Natural history of cerebral vein thrombosis: a systematic review |journal=Blood |volume=108 |issue=4 |pages=1129<U+2013>34 |year=2006 |pmid=16609071 |doi=10.1182/blood-2005-12-4795}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is rare, with an estimated 3-4 cases per million annual incidence in adults and 7 per million incidence in children (predominantly in the newborn<ref name=EFNS/>). However, a 1995 study showed that, in [[Saudi Arabia]], the incidence may be higher at 7 cases per 100,000.<ref name="emedicine">{{cite web | last = McElveen | first = W Alvin | title = Cerebral Venous Thrombosis | url=http://www.emedicine.com/neuro/TOPIC642.HTM | accessdate = 2008-04-22 }}</ref> Although an aged study, in 1973 Towbin described that, out of 182 [[autopsy|autopsies]], 9% had noticeable CVST.<ref name="emedicine"/> 75% of cases are in women; some historical evidence suggests that the use of [[oral contraceptive]]s in women is behind the disparity between the sexes.<ref name=Stam2005/> In adults, the disease occurs most often in the third decade.<ref name=EFNS/>
