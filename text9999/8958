'''Severe Tropical Cyclone Narelle''' was a [[Tropical cyclone scales#Australia and Fiji|Category&nbsp;4 cyclone]] in early January 2013 that brought light rains to areas in [[South Australia]] suffering from a [[drought]] and [[heat wave]]. On 4&nbsp;January, a tropical low developed within a [[monsoon trough]] over the [[Timor Sea]]. Over the following several days, the system gradually tracked westward and intensified, being classified Tropical Cyclone Narelle on 8&nbsp;January. Turning southward into a region of low wind shear, Narelle intensified into a severe tropical cyclone on 9&nbsp;January. Over the following two days, the cyclone's structure fluctuated, temporarily featuring an [[Eye (cyclone)|eye]], before it maintained its organisation and intensified further on 11&nbsp;January. The storm attained its peak intensity later on 11&nbsp;January as a Category&nbsp;4 cyclone with winds of 185&nbsp;km/h (115&nbsp;mph).{{#tag:ref|All sustained wind speeds are based on ten-minute standards unless otherwise stated.|group="nb"}} The following day, Narelle passed approximately {{convert|330|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=5}} northwest of [[Exmouth, Western Australia|Exmouth]] as it moved on a south-southwesterly course. The system steadily weakened and ultimately fell below tropical cyclone strength on 15&nbsp;January well to the west of [[Geraldton]].

Early in the storm's existence, Narelle brought strong winds, heavy rain, and high winds to many areas in Indonesia. More than 10,000 homes were flooded and many others were damaged by thunderstorms. A total of 14&nbsp;people were killed by the storm, and 17 others were listed as missing. In Western Australia, scattered strong thunderstorms caused minor damage and produced a possible [[tornado]]. Moisture from the storm spread into [[South Australia]], producing light rain and bringing relief to areas suffering from a severe drought.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Narelle 2013 track.png}}
On 4&nbsp;January, a weak [[Low-pressure area|area of low pressure]] developed within a [[monsoon trough]] near [[Timor]].<ref>{{cite web|work=Darwin Regional Forecasting Centre|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|date=4 January 2013|accessdate=23 January 2013|title=Tropical Cyclone 3 day Outlook for Northern Region, including the Gulf of Carpentaria|url=http://www.webcitation.org/6DSvNkeEw}}</ref> The following day, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center|Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)]] began monitoring the system for possible development into a [[tropical cyclone]].{{#tag:ref|The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] is a joint [[United States Navy]]&nbsp;<U+2013> [[United States Air Force]] task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for the western Pacific Ocean and other regions.|group="nb"}} Traveling westward, the system was forecast to intensify as it moved into an area highly favouring [[tropical cyclogenesis]] with very warm waters (with [[sea surface temperature]]s of {{convert|30|to|31|C|F|abbr=on}}) and low [[wind shear]]. Additionally, a nearby [[anticyclone]] provided good [[Outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] for the system.<ref>{{cite web|work=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|publisher=United States Navy|date=5 January 2013|accessdate=23 January 2013|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory For the Indian Ocean|url=http://www.webcitation.org/6DT4Nmuu5}}</ref> Over the following two days, deep [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] gradually built around the low and on 7&nbsp;January, the [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center|Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC)]] in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] designated the system as Tropical Low 05U, at which time the storm was situated roughly {{convert|135|km|mi|disp=5|abbr=on}} south-southeast of [[Sumba]], [[Indonesia]].{{#tag:ref|The [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]] offices of Perth and Darwin are two of the official [[Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre]] for the Australian cyclone region.|group="nb"}}<ref>{{cite web|work=Darwin Regional Forecasting Centre|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|date=7 January 2013|accessdate=23 January 2013|title=Tropical Low 05U Tropical Cyclone Technical Bulletin|url=http://www.webcitation.org/6DUMyMOmM}}</ref> By this time, the system was tracking west-southwestward around a [[subtropical ridge]], which would dictate the track of the storm for the remainder of its existence.<ref name="JTWC1"/> Later on 7&nbsp;January, the JTWC issued a [[Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert]] for the system, indicating that further development of the low into a significant tropical cyclone was anticipated.<ref>{{cite web|work=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|publisher=United States Navy|date=7 January 2013|accessdate=23 January 2013|title=Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert|url=http://www.webcitation.org/6DV0PJQk1}}</ref> Just seven hours after this, the JTWC classified the system as a tropical storm and began issuing advisories.<ref name="JTWC1">{{cite web|work=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|publisher=United States Navy|date=7 January 2013|accessdate=23 January 2013|title=Tropical Cyclone 08S (Eight) Advisory NR 001|url=http://www.webcitation.org/6DW3FvMQM}}</ref>

Residents and tourists were warned of waves up to {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Ferry service between Bali, [[West Nusa Tenggara]], and [[Java]] was suspended, isolating residents in [[Nusa Penida]], [[Nusa Lembongan]], and Nusa Ceningan.

Along the coast of Western Australia, between Onslow and [[Busselton, Western Australia|Busselton]], minor [[storm surge|storm tides]] were reported, with a peak rise of {{convert|1.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} in Onslow.
