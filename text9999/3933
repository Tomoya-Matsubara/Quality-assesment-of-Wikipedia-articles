The '''black-footed cat''', or '''small-spotted cat''' (''Felis nigripes'') is the smallest African [[Felidae|cat]], and is endemic in the southwest arid zone of the southern [[Africa]]n subregion. It is one of the lesser-studied African [[carnivore]]s, and is listed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] by [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] since 2002.<ref name="iucn">{{IUCN2008|assessors=Sliwa, A.|year=2008|id=8542|title=Felis nigripes|downloaded=22 March 2009}} Database entry includes justification for why this species is vulnerable</ref><ref name="Sliwa2004">Sliwa, A. (2004) ''Home range size and social organization of black-footed cats (Felis nigripes).'' Mammalian Biology 69 (2): 96-107</ref>

==Characteristics==
[[Image:Felis nigripes 9.JPG|thumb|left|Close-up of a black-footed cat at the [[Wuppertal Zoo]]]]
The black-footed cat is one of the smallest cat species. Adult resident males weigh on average {{convert|1.9|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and a maximum of {{convert|2.45|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Adult resident females weigh on average {{convert|1.3|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and a maximum of {{convert|1.65|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Sliwa2004" /> Males reach a head-to-body length of {{convert|36.7|to|43.3|cm|in|abbr=on}} with tails {{convert|16.4|to|19.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. Females are smaller with a maximum head-to-body-length of {{convert|36.9|cm|in|abbr=on}} and taills {{convert|12.6|to|17.0|cm|in|abbr=on}} long.<ref name="Smithers83">Smithers, R.H.N. (1983) ''The mammals of the southern African subregion''. University of Pretoria</ref> The shoulder height is about {{convert|25|cm|in}}.<ref>Stuart, C.T., Wilson, V.J. (1988) ''The cats of southern Africa.'' Chipangali Wildlife Trust, Bulawayo.</ref>

Only the pads and underparts of its feet are black, which gives the black-footed cat its name.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pollard|first=Michael|title=The encyclopedia of the cat|publisher=Barnes and Noble Books|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7607-3459-9|page=369}}</ref> The [[fur]] varies in colour from cinnamon-buff to tawny, and is patterned with black or brown spots that merge to form rings on the legs, neck, and tail. The skin, however, is unpigmented pink, unlike that of other spotted cats. The backs of the rounded ears are the same color as the background coat color. The eyes are very large.<ref name="WCoW">{{cite book|author=Sunquist, M., Sunquist, F. |year=2002 |title= Wild cats of the World |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location= Chicago |pages= 76<U+2013>82 |isbn= 0-226-77999-8}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
The black-footed cat is endemic to [[southern Africa]], and primarily found in South Africa, [[Namibia]], marginally into [[Zimbabwe]] and likely in extreme southern [[Angola]]. There are only historical but no recent records in [[Botswana]]. It lives in dry, open [[savanna]], grassland and [[Karoo]] [[semi-desert]] with shrub and tree cover at altitudes of up to {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, but not in the driest and sandiest parts of the [[Namib]] and [[Kalahari Desert]]s.<ref name="iucn" />

===Distribution of subspecies===
Two subspecies with different ranges are recognized:<ref name=msw3/>
* ''F. n. nigripes'' <U+2014> [[Botswana]], [[Namibia]], and in the northern parts of South Africa;
* ''F. n.  thomasi'' <U+2014> southeastern South Africa

According to Shortridge's description, ''F. n. nigripes'' is smaller and paler than ''F. n. thomasi''. But since specimens with characteristics of both assumed subspecies are found close to [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] in central South Africa, the existence of subspecies is questioned, as there are no geographical or ecological barriers to their ranges.<ref name=Olbricht97>Olbricht, G., Sliwa, A. (1997) ''In situ and ex situ observations and management of Black-footed cats Felis nigripes''. International Zoo Yearbook 35: 81<U+2013>89</ref>

==Ecology and behavior==
[[File:Blackfooted2.jpg|thumb|Adult black-footed cat resting]]
Black-footed cats are solitary and strictly [[nocturnal]], thus rarely seen. They spend the day resting in dense cover, in unoccupied [[burrow]]s of [[springhare]]s, [[porcupine]]s and [[aardvark]]s, or in hollow [[termite]] mounds. They emerge to hunt after sunset.<ref name=Olbricht97/>

They are typically found in dry, open habitat with some degree of vegetation cover. Apparently, they get all the moisture they need from their prey, but will drink water when available.<ref name="Smithers83"/>

Unlike most other cats, black-footed cats are poor climbers, and will generally ignore tree branches. Their stocky bodies and short tails are not conducive to tree-climbing.<ref name="Armstrong1977">Armstrong, J. (1977). The development and hand-rearing of black-footed cats. Pages 71<U+2013>80 in: Eaton, R. L. ''The World's cats; the proceedings of an International Symposium.'' Volume 3 number 3. Winston Wildlife Safari, Oregon</ref> They dig vigorously in the sand to extend or modify burrows for shelter.<ref name=WCoW/>

Black-footed cats are highly unsociable animals that seek refuge at the slightest disturbance. When cornered, they are known to defend themselves fiercely. Due to this habit and their courage, they are called ''miershooptier'' (anthill tigers) in parts of the South African Karoo, although they rarely use termite mounds for cover or for bearing their young. A [[San people|San]] legend claims that a black-footed cat can kill a [[giraffe]] by piercing its [[jugular]]. This exaggeration is intended to emphasize the bravery and tenacity of the animal.<ref>Sliwa, A. (2006). ''Atomic Kitten'' BBC Wildlife (November 2006): 36<U+2013>40</ref>

Within one year, a female covers an average range of {{convert|10|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, a resident male {{convert|22|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The range of an adult male overlaps the ranges of one to four females.<ref name=Sliwa2004/> On average, the animal travels {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} per night in search of prey. The cats use [[scent marking]] throughout their ranges, with males [[spraying (animal behavior)|spraying urine]] up to 12 times an hour. Other forms of scent marking include rubbing objects, raking with claws, and depositing [[faeces]] in visible locations. Their calls are louder than those of other cats of their size, presumably to allow them to call over relatively large distances. However, when close to each other, they use quieter purrs or gurgles, or hiss and growl if threatened.<ref name=WCoW/>

===Diet and hunting===
Due to their small size, black-footed cats hunt mainly small prey species, such as [[rodent]]s and small [[bird]]s, but may also take the [[White-quilled Bustard|white-quilled bustard]] and the [[Cape hare]], the latter heavier than itself. [[Insect]]s and [[spider]]s provide less than 1% of the prey mass consumed.<ref name=Sliwa1994>{{cite journal |author=Sliwa, A. |year=1994 |title = Black-footed cat studies in South Africa |journal=Cat News |volume=20 |pages=15<U+2013>19}}</ref><ref name=Sliwa2006>{{cite journal |author=Sliwa, A. |year=2006 |title=Seasonal and sex-specific prey composition of black-footed cats Felis nigripes |journal=Acta Theriologica |volume=51 |pages=195<U+2013>204 |issue=2 |doi=10.1007/BF03192671}}</ref> They are unusually active hunters, killing up to 14 small animals in a night. Their [[Metabolism|energy requirements]] are very high, with about {{convert|250|g|oz|0|abbr=on}} of prey per night consumed, which is about a sixth of its average body weight.<ref name=WCoW/>

Black-footed cats hunt mainly by stalking, rather than ambush, using the cover of darkness and all available traces of cover to approach their prey before the final pounce. They have been observed to hunt by moving swiftly to flush prey from cover, but also to slowly stalk through tufts of vegetation. Less commonly, they will wait outside rodent burrows, often with their eyes closed, but remaining alert for the slightest sound.<ref name=Olbricht97/> In common with the big cats, but unlike most other small species, black-footed cats have been observed to hide some of their captured prey for later feeding, rather than consuming it immediately.<ref name=Sliwa1994/>

===Reproduction and life cycle===
Black-footed cats have lived for 10 years in captivity. Females reach [[sexual maturity]] after 8 to 12 months. They come into [[estrus]] for only one or two days at a time, and are [[receptive to mating]] for a few hours, requiring males to locate them quickly. Copulation occurs frequently during this period. [[Gestation]] lasts from 63 to 68 days. A [[litter (animal)|litter]] consists usually of two kittens, but may vary from one to four young. Kittens weigh {{convert|60|to|84|g|oz|abbr=on}} at birth. They are born blind and relatively helpless, although they are able to crawl about after just a few hours. They are able to walk within two weeks, begin taking solid food after about a month, and are fully [[weaning|weaned]] by two months of age.<ref name="Leyhausen">Leyhausen, P., Tonkin, B. (1966). ''Breeding the black-footed cat (Felis nigripes) in captivity''. International Zoo Yearbook 6: 178<U+2013>182</ref>

Females may have up to two litters during the spring, summer and autumn. They rear their kittens in a burrow, moving them to new locations regularly after the first week. In general, kittens develop more rapidly than other similarly sized cats, quickly adapting them to a relatively hostile environment. They become independent by five months of age, but may remain within their mother's range.<ref name=WCoW/>

== Conservation ==
''Felis nigripes'' is included on [[CITES Appendix I]] and protected by national legislation across most of its range. Hunting is banned in Botswana and South Africa.<ref name="iucn" />

=== ''In situ'' research ===
The Black-footed Cat Working Group carries out a research project at Benfontein Nature Reserve and Nuwejaarsfontein Farm in central South Africa, where seven black-footed cats have been radio-collared. This project is part of a multidisciplinary effort to study the distribution, ecology, health, and reproduction of black-footed cats over an extended period.<ref>Sliwa, A., Wilson, B., Lawrenz, A. (2010). [http://wild-cat.org/nigripes/infos/Sliwa+Wilson+Lawrenz2010-Report-Felis-nigripes-SA.pdf ''Report on surveying and catching Black-footed cats (Felis nigripes) on Nuwejaarsfontein Farm / Benfontein Nature Reserve 4<U+2013>20 July 2010'']. [http://www.black-footed-cats.wild-cat.org Black-footed Working Group], July 2010</ref> In November 2012, this project was extended to Biesiesfontein Farm located in the [[Northern Cape Province]].<ref>Sliwa, A., Wilson, B., Lamberski, N., Lawrenz, A.

=== In captivity ===
[[Wuppertal]] Zoo acquired black-footed cats as long ago as 1957, and succeeded in breeding them in 1963. In 1993, the [[European Endangered Species Programme]] was formed to coordinate which animals are best suited for pairing to maintain genetic diversity and to avoid inbreeding. The ''International Studbook'' for the black-footed cat is kept in the German Wuppertal Zoo.<ref>Olbricht, G., Sch<U+00FC>rer, U. (1994). ''International Studbook for the Black-footed Cat 1994''. Zoologischer Garten der Stadt Wuppertal</ref> As of July 2011, there are detailed records for a total of 726 captive cats since 1964; worldwide 74 individuals were kept in 23 institutions in Germany, [[United Arab Emirates]], USA, UK, and South Africa.<ref>Stadler, A. (2011). ''International studbook for the black-footed cat (Felis nigripes)'' Volume 15. Zoologischer Garten der Stadt Wuppertal, Wuppertal</ref>

In February 2011, a female kept at the [[Audubon Nature Institute]] gave birth to two male kittens. This birth was significant in that the kittens are the first of their species to be born as a result of [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]] using frozen and thawed [[sperm]] and frozen and thawed embryos. In 2003, the sperm was collected from a male and then frozen. At the Audubon Nature Institute, it was later combined with an egg from a female, creating embryos in March 2005. Those embryos were frozen for almost six years before being thawed and transferred to a surrogate female in December 2010, which carried the embryos to term, resulting in the birth of the two kittens. Scientists hope this will provide a means to increase the species numbers, as well as introduce greater genetic variation into the small population.<ref>Burnette, S.
