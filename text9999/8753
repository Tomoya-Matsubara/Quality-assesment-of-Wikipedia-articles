The '''rings''', also known as the '''still rings''' in contrast to the [[flying rings]], is an [[artistic gymnastics]] apparatus and the event that uses it. It is traditionally used only by [[male]] [[gymnast]]s, due to intense strength requirements.

== Dimensions ==
Measures of the apparatus are published by the [[FIG]] in the ''Apparatus Norms'' brochure.

* Point of suspension 5.75 [[meters]] above floor 
* Height of rings 2.75 [[meters]] (including about 20 cm landing mats)
* Distance between the rings 50 cm
* Inside Diameter of the rings 18 cm
* Total Diameter of the rings 23.6 cm (thickness 2.8 cm, 18 + 2.8 * 2 = 23.6)

An exercise on rings consists of swing, strength and hold elements. Generally, gymnasts are required to fulfill various requirements including a swing to held handstand, an aerial dismount, and of course, a static strength hold. More experienced gymnasts will often perform more than one strength element, sometimes swinging into hold positions or even doing different holds back to back. 

One of the most famous skills done on the rings is the '''Iron Cross'''. This is done by extending both arms straight out from the body and holding oneself up in the air for at least two seconds.  Other common strength moves include the inverted cross (simply an upside-down iron cross), and the Maltese cross where the gymnast holds his body parallel to the ground at ring height with his arms extended laterally. Swing moves include [[giant swings]] from handstand to handstand, somewhat similar to those performed on the [[horizontal bar]]. Moves on the still rings are regulated by the [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Code of Points]].

Rings can also be arranged in a line, along the length of a swimming pool.  These exist (over swimming pools) at a small number of Victorian Sports Clubs in the UK. Two examples exist in Glasgow along with trapezes, at the Arlington (1870) and the Western Baths (1876). These have both been continuously open in their original buildings, and are private membership clubs. Skilled users, male & female, travel the length of the bath, and return without touching the water.

==Holds==
* [[Back lever]]/[[Front lever]]
* Crosses : Regular/L-seated cross, Olympic (no longer used), Azarian (cross sequence/roll cross), Inverted cross, Maltese (horizontal ring-height planche), Victorian (aka inverted Maltese)
* L seat, straddle L seat, V sit
* Planche: in a pushup position, with neither knees, stomach, nor feet touching the ground; in effect, a horizontal handstand. variations are straddled and straight-legged

==Swings==
* [[Dislocate]]
* [[Inlocate]]
