'''USS ''Becuna'' (SS/AGSS-319)''', a [[Balao class submarine|''Balao''-class]] [[submarine]], is a former ship of the [[United States Navy]] named for the [[becuna]], a pike-like fish of Europe.

==World War II==
''Becuna'' (SS-319) was launched 30 January 1944 by [[General Dynamics Electric Boat|Electric Boat Company]], [[Groton, Connecticut]]; sponsored by Mrs. George C. Crawford, wife of Commander Crawford, and commissioned 27 May 1944, Lieutenant Commander H. D. Sturr in command.

''Becuna'' departed [[Naval Submarine Base New London|New London]] 1 July 1944 and arrived at [[Pearl Harbor]] 29 July. Her war operations extended from 23 August 1944 to 27 July 1945. During this period she completed five war patrols in the [[Philippines]], [[South China Sea]], and the [[Java Sea]]. ''Becuna'' is credited with having sunk two [[Japan]]ese [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]]s totaling 3,888&nbsp;tons. For detailed accounts, see<ref>[http://www.phillyseaport.org/historicships/becunawarpatrols.html Seaport  Museum Philadelphia Submarine, BECUNA]</ref>.

The submarine arrived at [[Subic Bay]], [[Luzon]], from her last war patrol 27 July 1945. In September 1945 she arrived at [[San Diego]], California. 

''Becuna'' received four [[battle star]]s for her [[World War II]] service.

==Post-war service==
After World War II ''Becuna'' continued to operate with Submarine Force, [[US Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]], until April 1949 when she was ordered to Submarine Force, [[US Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]], as a unit of [[Submarine Squadron 8]].

Between May 1949 and May 1950 she conducted refresher training exercises and also assisted in training of student officers and men at [[New London, Connecticut]]. In November 1950 she returned to Electric Boat Co., for a complete modernization overhaul, being refitted as a [[Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program#GUPPY IA Program|GUPPY]]-type submarine. The overhaul was completed in August 1951, and ''Becuna'' sailed to the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] for shakedown. She returned to New London in September 1951.

''Becuna'' operated with the Atlantic Fleet, making two cruises with the [[US 6th Fleet|6th Fleet]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and one to [[Scotland]]. Other than these extended cruises, the majority of ''Becuna'''s service was at New London as a training submarine.

In 1969, she was reclassified an Auxiliary Submarine, '''AGSS-319'''.

==Museum ship==

''Becuna'' was decommissioned on 7 November 1969, and laid up in the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]]. She reverted to '''SS-319''' in 1971. She was struck from the [[Naval Register]] on 15 August 1973.

''Becuna'' was placed on permanent display at the [[Independence Seaport Museum]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], 21 June 1976, where she has been part of the museum's Historic Ship Zone since 1996. She and the adjacent cruiser ''[[USS Olympia (C-6)|USS Olympia]]'', [[George Dewey|Commodore George Dewey]]'s flagship, are open to the public for visitation.

She was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1986.<ref>[http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1785&ResourceType=Structure Listing at the National Park Service]</ref> In 2001, ''Becuna'' received the Historical Welded Structure Award of the [[American Welding Society]].
