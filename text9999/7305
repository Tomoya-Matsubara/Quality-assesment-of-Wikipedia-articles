'''St Patrick's High School''' is a Roman Catholic non-selective, all ability and all inclusive secondary school situated outside [[Armagh City]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Leitch|first=Will|title=Parents confusion over 11 plus future|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/8235855.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 October 2011}}</ref> The school teaches boys and girls of all abilities, from the high academic achiever to the child with learning difficulties.  The school recently celebrated its 40th anniversary. The school was established in 1970 to serve the young people of [[Derrynoose]], [[Keady]], [[Madden]], [[Ballymacnab]], [[Granemore]], Clady and [[Middletown, County Armagh|Middletown]]. St Patrick's now also has students from [[Armagh]] and [[Monaghan]]. 

The school aims to provide children with a secure, caring, Christian and happy environment where high standards of learning, discipline and personal integrity can be achieved, and where all pupils are given opportunities to develop their mental and physical, oral and social ability.

The school has grown dramatically since 1970 when it had 450 pupils and 22 teachers to its present enrolment of 1015 pupils (including 240 Sixth Form pupils) and 70 teachers. In September 1999 we moved into a completely new purpose-built school with the most up-to-date facilities in Ireland which include a 500 square assembly hall and sports hall, sixth form suite, pavilions for Careers, Music and Drama, Lecture Theatre, Oratory and purpose-built accommodation for all Areas of Study and excellent outdoor facilities. These have been further enhanced with the completion of the Keady Recreation Centre. As part of this innovative <U+2018>Dual Use Scheme<U+2019> with Armagh City and District Council, the school now has use of a state-of-the-art synthetic pitch with floodlighting, a new four changing room pavilion with meeting room, a new grass pitch and a two floor fitness suite.  The school has celebrated excellent examination results and has been included as one of the top non-selective secondary schools in Northern Ireland, for example in 2010/2011 88% of students achieved 5A*-C grades at GCSE.

School Aid Romania was set up in 1990 with two main aims: to assist children in need in Romania and to bring together pupils from different schools and different communities in Northern Ireland. In pursuit of its aims, School Aid Romania's objectives are to contribute to the development of community relations and mutual understanding between young people in Northern Ireland and to secure, by joint ventures, material assistance to relieve poverty and improve the well-being of young people in Romania.

St. Patrick's take great interest in helping those in need and the first ever SAR from Keady took place in February in 2012.  Over 20 students and three teachers took part in a life changing visit. All involved loved the trip and have many irreplaceable memories.
