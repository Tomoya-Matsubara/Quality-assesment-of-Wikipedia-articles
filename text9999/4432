'''Olav Aukrust''' (21 January 1883 &ndash; 3 November 1929) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[poet]] and teacher. He was born in [[Lom, Norway|Lom]] and wrote poems with a renewed national [[Romantic Poetry|romantic]] style. His use of [[rural]] [[dialect]] contributed to the growth of [[Nynorsk]] as a literary [[language]].

==Life==
Aukrust was married to Gudrun Blekastad. He was strongly influenced by [[Ivar Mortensson-Egnund]], and used a characteristically similar form. Until 1917, he worked as a teacher at the folk high school for [[Dovre]] (1915<U+2013>17) where his friend [[Ingeborg M<U+00F8>ller]] was a teacher, as well as in [[Gausdal]]. He suffered from [[tuberculosis]], which came to characterize his last year and led to an early death. 

Olav Aukrust joined the [[Anthroposophical Society]] in December 1921 after he and his wife, Gudrun Aukrust, traveled through [[Goetheanum]] on their way home from [[Italy]].

His nephews were [[Odd Aukrust]] and [[Kjell Aukrust]], an [[author]] and [[artist]].
