He then added "and we must!" [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] replied "Why?" Leach exclaimed "''Because if we do not, or if we pussyfoot in our actions and do not achieve complete success, in another few months we shall be living in a different country whose word counts for little.''"<ref name="Telegraph obit."/> Leach then explained how the task force would take shape and what ships would be involved: when asked about the lack of available aircraft carriers, Leach reassured the Prime Minister that the two small carriers available would suffice.<ref name="Telegraph obit."/> Thatcher approved this and preparations were made to send a task force to set sail to retake the Falklands.<ref name="Telegraph obit."/> On account of his determination, [[Andrew Marr]] referred to Leach as Thatcher's "Knight in Shining Gold Braid" in his documentary series ''[[Andrew Marr's History of Modern Britain|History of Modern Britain]]''.<ref name="Telegraph obit."/> Leach was promoted to [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] upon retirement in December 1982.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=49174|supp=yes|startpage=15293|date=22 November 1982|accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref>
