'''Tyrone Anthony Wheatley''' (born [[January 19]], [[1972]]) is a former professional [[American football]] player who played 10&nbsp;[[season (sports)|seasons]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and was one of the most successful [[high school]] and [[College|collegiate]] athletes in [[Metro Detroit|Metropolitan Detroit]] history. In high school, he was a member of state-champion teams in both [[Athletics (track and field)|track and field]] and football, was named [[Michigan]]'s track and field athlete of the year and football athlete of the year in the same [[academic year]], and earned [[All-America]] track honors in both high school and college. Following his graduation from high school as one of Michigan's best athletes, he attended the [[University of Michigan]] on an [[athletic scholarship]] and earned first-team All-[[Big Ten Conference]] honors on Big Ten Champion football and track teams. 

At the University of Michigan, Wheatley earned the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year Award during the [[1992 NCAA Division I-A football season|1992 football season]]. In the [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan Wolverines]]' post-season [[bowl game]], he was named the [[Most Valuable Player]] for his performance in the team's 1993 [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] victory. Wheatley continued his track success as well, earning first-team All-Big Ten Conference and All-American honors. He ranks among the Wolverines' all-time [[Rush (American football)|rushing]] leaders in numerous categories, and his name appears in several places in the Big Ten football record book. He was named to All-Big Ten teams in football and track and field a total of four times, and he earned portions of six Big Ten championships (two team awards for football, one team award for indoor track, one award for [[110 meter hurdles]], and two awards for individual football statistical performances).

Following his graduation from the University of Michigan, Wheatley was selected by the [[New York Giants]] of the [[National Football League]] in the first round of the [[1995 NFL Draft]]. As a [[running back]] for the Giants, he was the team's [[all-purpose yards]] leader in 1996 and their leading [[Carry (American football)|ballcarrier]] in 1997. Despite his success on the field, he developed a reputation as a tardy [[WIKT:dawdle|dawdle]]r. He was traded to the [[Miami Dolphins]], but cut before the [[1998 NFL season|1998 season]] began. He signed with the [[Oakland Raiders]] and flourished, leading the team in rushing three times and twice finishing among the NFL's top ten players by rushing [[touchdown]]s. With Wheatley, the Raiders went to the playoffs three years in a row, including one [[Super Bowl]] appearance. During his NFL career ([[1995 NFL season|1995]]&ndash;[[2004 NFL season|2004]]), he totaled over 6,500&nbsp;[[All-purpose yardage|all-purpose yards]] as a [[running back]] and [[kickoff returner]].

After retiring from the NFL, Wheatley returned to his hometown to coach his high school alma mater, [[Dearborn Heights, Michigan|Dearborn Heights]]' Hamilton J. Robichaud High School, where he had previously made a name for himself as a nine-time [[Michigan High School Athletic Association]] (MHSAA) state champion athlete. As a player, he had led the school to its only state football championship. In his first year as head football coach, his team rebounded from an 0&ndash;9&nbsp;record to compile a 9&ndash;2 record, reaching the playoffs for the first time since 1994. After a year of success coaching high school, he was hired in 2008 to serve as running backs coach for [[Team Michigan]] in the [[All American Football League]].

==Early life==
Wheatley was born in {{city-state|Inkster|Michigan}}, a city nicknamed "Baby Saigon" for its high crime rate.<ref name=SoTT/> Inkster is located in [[Metro Detroit|Metropolitan Detroit]], east of both [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] and the [[University of Michigan]].  Wheatley's father (also named Tyrone)<ref name=SoTT/> suffered a mortal [[gunshot]] wound to the head in 1974 when Wheatley was two years old.<ref name=PFTTSotGBE>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E0D9123EF935A35754C0A96E958260&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/W/Wheatley,%20Tyrone|title= Pro Football; The Two Sides of the Giants' Biggest Enigma|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2007-11-15|date=[[1998-07-06]]|author=Pennington, Bill}}</ref>  Wheatley's [[stepfather]] died of a heart attack when he was 13, leaving behind Wheatley, his sister, and half-brother, two-year-old Leslie Mongo.<ref name=SoTT>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEFD9143CF93AA2575BC0A963958260|title= Sports of The Times; Set Sails Can't Control The Wind|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=[[1995-08-19]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[New York Times]]|author=[[William Rhoden|Rhoden, William C.]]}}</ref>   Shortly afterward, Wheatley's mother, Patricia,<ref name=PFTTSotGBE/> was [[layoff|laid off]] and became an [[alcoholic]]. With the effective loss of his two parents, Wheatley and his sister were forced to move in with an aunt, where he lived through the rest of his childhood.<ref name=SoTT/>  Due to family difficulties, Wheatley acts as the guardian of two cousins and his half brother.<ref name=PFTTSotGBE/><ref name=SoTT/> Mongo was ten years younger than Wheatley,<ref name=PFTTSotGBE/> and graduated high school in New Jersey in 2004<U+2014>thirteen years after Wheatley had graduated high school.<ref name=2004USFS/> 

Wheatley was involved in competitive athletics from an early age: In his youth, he ran competitively with the Penn Park track team, where, as an eight-year-old, he stood out for his discipline and promptness.<ref name=MhWwbgm/>  Because of his family trouble, he assumed a family leadership role at a relatively young age.  Wheatley made it clear to his brothers and sisters that when chaos came to their lives, they should to turn to him because he would be there and he would never fall.<ref name=SoTT/> When he was in high school, he would take his younger siblings to basketball games, mapping out emergency plans for shooting outbreaks or brawls.<ref name=PFTTSotGBE/> Wheatley's guardianship continued throughout his career at the University of Michigan and while he was a professional athlete. While playing in the NFL, he realized that leaving Mongo<U+2014>the youngest of his siblings<U+2014>in Inkster and merely providing financial support was not a solution because Mongo was still exposed to [[gang]] shootings. As Mongo's guardian, Wheatley moved Mongo to New Jersey for school. Mongo later earned outstanding freshman athlete honors during the {{city-state|Bergen County|New Jersey}} outdoor track championships while living with Wheatley, who was playing for the Giants at the time.<ref name=PFTTSotGBE/> In 2004, with his graduation from high school imminent, Mongo signed a [[letter of intent]] with the [[Utah State Aggies football]] team as a [[defensive back]].<ref name=2004USFS>{{cite web|url=http://utahstateaggies.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/020404aaa.html|title=2004 Utah State Football Signees (as of 10:15 a.m.)|date=[[2004-02-04]]|accessdate=2008-01-30|publisher=utahstateaggies.cstv.com}}</ref>

Wheatley chose to remain in metropolitan Detroit and attend the University of Michigan on an athletic scholarship.  He played running back for the football team for four years and ran on the track team for three years.  As both a football player and track athlete he was highly decorated; he earned first-team All-Big Ten honors on teams that won Big Ten Championships in both sports and All-American Honors in track.  In football he set and retains numerous school records and in track he achieved some of the fastest times in school history.

Despite the original visions, Wheatley was used sparingly and started only eight games over the course of four seasons with the Giants.<ref name=DCWiFWoC/> Off the field, Wheatley moved his half-brother with him to New Jersey to keep him out of the tumultuous environment and to provide him a strong learning environment.<ref name=PFWaGNGG/> 

In 1995 and 1996, under [[Dan Reeves]] the Giants had losing seasons and relied heavily on [[Rodney Hampton]] who received the bulk of the carries on rushing plays. In [[1995 NFL season|1995]], running back [[Herschel Walker]] received more passing downs and in [[1996 NFL season|1996]] [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] [[Charles Way]] was a main weapon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/teams/newyorkgiants/statistics?season=1995&team=NYG&seasonType=|accessdate=2008-02-25|title=New York Giants (1995)|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC.}}</ref><ref name=NYG96>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/teams/newyorkgiants/statistics?season=1996&team=NYG&seasonType=|accessdate=2008-02-25|title=New York Giants (1996)|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC.}}</ref> Wheatley returned kickoffs for the 1995 and 1996, with 10&nbsp;returns for 18.6&nbsp;yards per return in 1995 and 23&nbsp;returns for 21.9&nbsp;yards per return in 1996.<ref name=TWNFL>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/players/tyronewheatley/careerstats?id=WHE081965|title=Tyrone Wheatley|accessdate=2008-02-25|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC}}</ref>  While Hampton led the team in rushing with 827&nbsp;yards to Wheatley's 400&nbsp;yards in 1996, Wheatley's 503&nbsp;[[return yards]] and 51&nbsp;yards receiving gave him the team [[All-purpose yardage|all-purpose yards]] leadership.<ref name=NYG96/>  However, Wheatley had 6&nbsp;[[fumble]]s on only 147&nbsp;touches (112&nbsp;rushes, 12&nbsp;receptions, and 23&nbsp;kickoff returns).<ref name=TWNFL/>

The drafting of Wheatley had been hotly contested.  Some Giant draft war-room personnel had wanted to select [[Korey Stringer]] and others had an interest in [[Rashaan Salaam]] when the Giant's selection came.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5D6103FF937A15757C0A963958260&scp=34&sq=Tyrone+Wheatley+draft&st=nyt|title=Pro Football; On a Successful Draft Day, the Giants' Staff Turns Chaos Into Science |accessdate=2008-02-01|date=[[1995-04-25]]|publisher= [[The New York Times Company]]|work= [[New York Times]]|author=Freeman, Mike}}</ref>  After Wheatley was selected with the seventeenth pick, running backs, [[Napoleon Kaufman]], [[James Stewart (American football)|James Stewart]] and Rashaan Salaam were chosen with the eighteenth, nineteenth and twenty-first selections, respectively.

====Jim Fassel era (1997&ndash;1998)====

In [[1997 NFL season|1997]], by the end of training camp, Rodney Hampton's knees had given out, and although Wheatley had a great camp, [[Tiki Barber]] was named the starting [[tailback]].<ref name=PFWaGNGG/> That season, [[Jim Fassel]]'s first, the Giants went to the [[NFL playoffs, 1997-98|  playoffs]] with a 10&ndash;5&ndash;1 record.

By [[1998 NFL season|1998]], Wheatley was the only four-year veteran in the Giants backfield and although he developed another good relationship with an offensive coordinator, he was becoming accustomed to being described as an enigma.<ref name=PFTTSotGBE/>  The Giants fell to 8&ndash;8 while relying on Barber, Way and [[Gary Brown]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/teams/newyorkgiants/statistics?season=1998&team=NYG&seasonType=|accessdate=2008-02-25|title=New York Giants (1998)|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC.}}</ref>  During the season, Wheatley often performed [[scout team]] duties and was inactive for some games.  Fassel was not sympathetic to Wheatley's desire for playing time and thought that Wheatley was overweight.<ref name=PFNFFFWFHN/>  Over the course of the season, there was controversy about a season long weight limit of {{convert|235|lb|kg stlb|lk=on}} that had been placed on Wheatley.<ref name=PFWPItRWRS>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E5D71F31F934A2575AC0A96E958260&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/W/Wheatley,%20Tyrone|title= Pro Football; Weight Problem Is the Reason Wheatley Remains Sidelined for Giants|accessdate=2007-11-15|date=[[1998-09-17]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[New York Times]]|author=Pennington, Bill}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DF1230F933A1575AC0A96E958260&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/W/Wheatley,%20Tyrone|title=  Pro Football; Wheatley Is In Under the Scale|accessdate=2007-11-15|date=[[1998-09-20]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[New York Times]]|author=Pennington, Bill}}</ref>  Wheatley's playing weight limit had been set at {{convert|230|lb|kg stlb|sigfig=3}} in [[training camp]] and had been raised to 235 on Wheatley's request.<ref name=PFWPItRWRS/>  He had played at {{convert|233|lb|kg stlb}} in the final game of his college career.<ref name=WPWGDNSaM/>  By week 11, Wheatley had only dressed in five games and played in four and was relegated to a role as an alternate when he played.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E3D81231F937A25752C1A96E958260&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/W/Wheatley,%20Tyrone|title= Football: Giants Notebook; For Wheatley, a Kickoff Cameo?|accessdate=2007-11-15|date=[[1998-11-14]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[New York Times]]|author=Pennington, Bill}}</ref>

Wheatley thought he was treated unfairly in New York although two different coaching staffs had issues with him.  He points out [[double standard]]s that gave him bad feelings in retrospect.  In situations where he was not the only Giant who was overweight or stuck in traffic, he was punished while others were not and those with worse problems such as showing up at practice drunk or being cited for [[Drunk driving (United States)|D.U.I.]] were not vilified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DEEDB1730F93AA15753C1A9669C8B63&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/W/Wheatley,%20Tyrone|title=Pro Football: Notebook; Running Backs Thriving as Reclamation Projects|accessdate=2007-11-14|date=[[2000-10-29]]|author=Freeman, Mike|publisher= [[The New York Times Company]]|work= [[New York Times]]}}</ref>  Wheatley had the responsibility of driving his brother, Leslie Mongo, to his school that opened at 8:15 and thought he was the victim of New Jersey traffic in relation to occasionally being late for 9:00 a.m. team meetings.<ref name=WPWGDNSaM/>  Charles Way, by contrast, Wheatley's closest friend on the team and [[roommate]] on the road, was nicknamed "Teacher's Pet."<ref name=PFWaGNGG>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CEED6173AF930A25751C0A96F958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1|title= Pro Football; Wheatley and Giants Never Gained Ground|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=[[1999-02-13]]|author=Pennington, Bill}}</ref> 

According to [[The New York Times]], there was a misperception of Wheatley as a "cancer"<ref name=OPFTGCUWSN/> in the locker room by most accounts.  Although he had some issues, his teammates remembered him for his personality and mannerly nature.<ref name=OPFTGCUWSN/>  The general opinion of Wheatley was that he was blessed with enormous talent, but as a package he was an enigma.  According to [[Michael Strahan]], Wheatley "...could outrun the [[wide receiver]]s, outlift the [[Lineman (American football)|linemen]] and outdebate anyone."<ref name=FFMGHTiO/>  Thus, his off-season workout pattern of sloughing the weights for discussion of politics and current affairs was troubling, but not challenged because he could outlift most.<ref name=FFMGHTiO/>  However, in addition to the enigmatic issues, Wheatley had physical problems in New York.  He was injured and unable to perform for parts of all four of the training camps.<ref name=PFBRWiH/>  After the 1998 season Wheatley was traded to [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]]'s [[Miami Dolphins]].<ref name=PFACWRUBN/>  In the February trade, the Giants were satisfied receiving a seventh round draft pick in return.<ref name=OPFTGCUWSN/>

Wheatley rushed for 1,000&nbsp;yards in a season, led the Raiders in rushing three times, appeared in three consecutive playoffs (including one Super Bowl) and finished in the top-10 in the NFL for rushing touchdowns twice.

[[Image:John Gruden-cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jon Gruden]]'s west coast offense brought out the best in veterans like Wheatley.]]

On the field, Wheatley became an important part of a surprisingly efficient [[West Coast offense]] run by [[Jon Gruden]].<ref name=OPFTGCUWSN/>  In 1999, Wheatley was the Raiders' leading rusher and their only running back to have more than one touchdown reception.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/teams/oaklandraiders/statistics?season=1999&team=OAK&seasonType=|title=Oakland Raiders (1999)|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> For the first time, Wheatley had multiple 100-yard games in the same season:<ref name=TWBG/> 100&nbsp;yards on 20&nbsp;rushes on [[October 3]] against the Seattle Seahawks and 111&nbsp;yards on 19&nbsp;rushes on [[December 19]] against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores99/99276/99276353.htm|title=Oakland vs. Seattle|accessdate=2008-01-23|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=[[1999-10-04]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores99/99353/99353350.htm|title=Tampa Bay 0, Oakland 45 |accessdate=2008-01-23|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=[[1999-12-19]]}}</ref>   The players gelled as a unit and not only did Wheatley have his best seasons in Oakland, but also long time NFL veterans on the Raiders amassed their best season upon his arrival.  For example, [[Rich Gannon]], an NFL veteran [[quarterback]] since [[1987 NFL season|1987]], made his first four [[Pro Bowl]] appearances with Wheatley as a weapon.  The team only compiled an 8&ndash;8 record, however.

Wheatley had the best season of his career in the [[2000 NFL season|2000]] as Raiders went 12<U+2013>4 and reached the [[American Football Conference]] championship game of the [[NFL playoffs, 2000-01|2000<U+2013>01 NFL playoffs]].

In [[2001 NFL season|2001]], with the arrival of [[Jerry Rice]] and [[Charlie Garner]], the offense focused on the passing game, running five more pass attempts per game than the year before.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/10/19/SP204000.DTL&hw=Tyrone+Wheatley&sn=005&sc=642|title=Wheatley's status still a mystery|accessdate=2007-11-15|date=[[2001-10-19]]|publisher=[[Hearst Communications Inc.]]|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|author=Smith Michelle}}</ref>  The team produced two 1,000-yard receivers with Rice amassing 1,139&nbsp;yards and [[Tim Brown]] totaling 1,165&nbsp;yards.

====Bill Callahan era (2002&ndash;2003)====

Under new coach [[Bill Callahan (coach)|Bill Callahan]], the [[2002 NFL season|2002]] Raiders became more reliant on Garner as the primary running back.  Again, Rice and Brown were primary targets for Gannon who, while having his best season with 4,689&nbsp;yards, did not use Wheatley as a receiver as much as other players.  Wheatley had few more carries than in 2001, but did not start a single game and did not see the end zone often. Again, Wheatley went an entire season without a 100-yard rushing game.<ref name=TWBG/> However, as a role player he was able to play in three [[NFL playoffs, 2002-03|2002<U+2013>03 playoff games]] including the [[Super Bowl XXXVII|2003 Super Bowl]] against former coach Gruden.<ref name=TWP/>  As in his previous seasons, Wheatley posted his best playoff numbers in his first game, this time 30&nbsp;yards on only four carries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores103/103012/20030112NFL--OAKLAND---0nr.htm|title=Oakland 30, N.Y.

In [[2003 NFL season|2003]], Wheatley reclaimed his role as the Raiders' leading rusher although Garner, the second leading rusher, continued to be the target of more passes and Crockett made it to the end zone as a rusher as often as Wheatley and Garner combined.  Wheatley became the sixth person to lead the Raiders franchise in rushing yards three times ([[Clem Daniels]], [[Marv Hubbard]], [[Mark van Eeghen]], [[Marcus Allen]], [[Napoleon Kaufman]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rai/|title=Oakland Raiders Franchise Encyclopedia|accessdate=2008-01-18|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC.|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com}}</ref>  The 2003 Raiders fell to 4<U+2013>12 and had no 1,000-yard receivers or runners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/teams/oaklandraiders/statistics?season=2003&team=OAK&seasonType=|title=Oakland Raiders (2003)|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> Wheatley<U+2019>s only 100-yard rushing game came on [[November 16]] at home against the [[Minnesota Vikings]].<ref name=TWBG/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=231116013|title=Minnesota 18, Oakland 28|accessdate=2008-01-23|date=[[2003-11-16]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}</ref>

Wheatley's name and those of several of his teammates were found on the list of clients of the [[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative]] (BALCO) that had given performance-enhancing drugs to [[Marion Jones]] and others.  As a result he, and teammates [[Chris Hetherington]], [[Dana Stubblefield]], and [[Chris Cooper (football player)|Chris Cooper]] were called to testify before a 2003&nbsp;federal [[grand jury]] investigating a laboratory that produces [[Dietary supplement|nutritional supplement]]s.  [[Johnnie Morton]] was called before the same jury.

====Norv Turner era (2004)====

Although Wheatley's 2003 performance had been modest compared with the other seasons that he led the Raiders in rushing (1999, 2000), it was sufficient to convince the Raiders that they did not need to re-sign the pass catching running back Charlie Garner for the [[2004 NFL season|2004 season]] with the new coach [[Norv Turner]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_38_228/ai_n6203721 |title=AFC West |publisher=FindArticles|work=Sporting News|accessdate=2007-11-15|date=[[2004-09-20]]}}</ref> The 2004 Raiders used a platoon of five runners (Wheatley, Crockett, [[Justin Fargas]], [[J.
