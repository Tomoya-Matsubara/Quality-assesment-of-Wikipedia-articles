'''Tzath II''' was King of [[Lazica]] from 556 to an unknown date. He was the younger brother of [[Gubazes II of Lazica|Gubazes II]], who was assassinated by [[Byzantine]] generals in autumn 555. At the time, Tzath resided at the Byzantine capital, [[Constantinople]], and the [[Laz people|Lazi]] sent a delegation to the Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527<U+2013>565) to request both justice for their murdered king and the confirmation of Tzath as their new king (the Lazic rulers, as [[client king]]s, had to have their accession confirmed by the emperor, who awarded them with their [[regalia]]). Tzath arrived in Lazica in spring 556, accompanied by the ''[[magister militum]]'' Soterichus, and was received in an elaborately staged welcome ceremony. Nothing further is known of him.
