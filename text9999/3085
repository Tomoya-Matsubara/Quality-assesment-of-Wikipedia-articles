Most of the steam locomotives and other railroad equipment at Steamtown NHS were originally collected by [[F. Nelson Blount]], a millionaire seafood processor from New England.  In 1964, Blount established a non-profit organization, the Steamtown Foundation, to operate [[Steamtown, USA]], a steam railroad museum and excursion business in [[Bellows Falls, Vermont]]. In 1984, the foundation moved Steamtown to Scranton, conceived of as urban redevelopment and funded in part by the city. But the museum failed to attract the expected 200,000 to 400,000 annual visitors, and within two years was facing bankruptcy.<ref name= Barcousky>Barcousky, Len.

Steamtown NHS is located within a working [[Classification yard|railroad yard]] and incorporates the surviving elements of the 1902 DL&W Scranton roundhouse and locomotive repair shops. The visitor center, theater, technology and history museums are built in the style of and on the site of the missing portions of the original roundhouse, giving an impression of what the original circular structure was like.<ref name=HistoricReg.>{{cite web|title=Steamtown National Historic Site|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/delaware/dic.htm|work=nps.gov|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=MArch 11, 2012}}</ref><ref name=nps.com>{{cite web|title=Steamtown|url=http://www.nps.gov/stea/index.htm|work=nps.com|publisher=The National Parks Service|accessdate=March 11, 2012}}</ref>  

The museum has exhibits about the history and technology of steam railroads in the United States and [[Pennsylvania]], particularly the DL&W; life on the railroad; and the business, labor, and governmental relationships between railroads.<ref name=HistoricReg. /> The theater shows a short film throughout the day.<ref name=nps.com /> 

Many locomotives and freight and passenger cars are on display. Some have open cabs and compartments that visitors can climb in and walk through, including a [[railway post office|mail car]], railroad executives' passenger car (with dining room and sleeping / lounge areas), a [[boxcar]], two [[caboose]]s, and a recreated DL&W station with ticket window. A steam locomotive with cutaway sections helps visitors understand steam power. Part of one of the 1865 roundhouse inspection pits uncovered in archaeological excavations is also preserved ''in situ'', under glass.<ref name=nps.com />

==Demonstrations, tours, and excursions==
[[File:Steamtown-Nicholson-Viaduct.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A Steamtown excursion crosses [[Tunkhannock Viaduct]].]]
Steamtown NHS offers a variety of demonstrations, tours, and excursions that demonstrate how railroads functioned in the age of steam. Park rangers give guided tours of the locomotive shop, where one can see work being done on the steam engines in the original roundhouse area; the [[Union Pacific Big Boy]] locomotive on display; and demonstrations of the turntable on a regular basis. They also give talks on the history of Steamtown. The Scranton yard occupies about {{convert|40|acre|ha}}.

Several working locomotives take visitors on short excursions through the Scranton yard in the spring, summer, and fall. Most rides are on passenger coaches, but there are also caboose and [[handcar]] rides offered. These rides are included in the admission, although reservations may be required. Longer excursions are scheduled with separate tickets. These include a ride on a [[Pullman (car or coach)|Pullman coach]] and longer trips to various nearby towns, including the [[Lackawanna River]] valley and [[Carbondale, Pennsylvania|Carbondale]], [[Tobyhanna Township, Monroe County, Pennsylvania|Tobyhanna]] and [[Moscow, Pennsylvania]].  On rare occasions, excursions are run to the [[Delaware Water Gap]], [[East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania|East Stroudsburg]], and [[Cresco, Pennsylvania]], or on the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] to [[Binghamton, New York]].  Steamtown also plays host to [http://www.railcamp.com/ RailCamp], a program put on by the [[National Park Service]] and National Railway Historical Society to educate future railroad employees and fans of the industry about railroad operation and preservation.

==History==

===New England roots===
F. Nelson Blount, the heir to the largest seafood processor in the United States, was an avid railroad enthusiast. When he was 17, he wrote a book on steam power; later, he amassed one of the largest collections of vintage steam locomotives in the United States. By 1964, part of his collection &mdash; 25 steam locomotives from the United States and Canada, 10 other locomotives, and 25 pieces of rolling stock &mdash; was housed at [[North Walpole, New Hampshire]].<ref name= Sawyer>Sawyer, Mina Titus.''[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xcQgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3mkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1828,3484275&dq=nelson-blount&hl=en Maine's 'Iron Horses' Head For Their Last Dramatic Round-up]''.

Accessed on July 13, 2010</ref>  Blount established the "Steamtown Foundation for the Preservation of Steam and Railroad Americana" to operate [[Steamtown, USA]] in 1964. The non-profit, charitable, educational organization was to have nine un-salaried directors, including the five incorporators: Blount, former New Hampshire governor [[Lane Dwinell]]; Emile Bussiere; Robert L. Mallat, Jr., mayor of Keene; and Bellows Falls Municipal Judge [[Thomas P. Salmon]], who later became governor of Vermont. The president of the [[Campbell Soup Company]], [[William B. Murphy]], who had also served as National Chairman of [[Radio Free Europe]], and the vice president of Blount Seafood, Fredrick Richardson, were among the other directors. The first order of business for the Steamtown Foundation was to acquire the Blount collection at North Walpole, and move it to property once owned by the [[Rutland Railroad]], in Bellows Falls, Vermont.<ref name= Sawyer />

Blount was killed on August 31, 1967, when his private airplane hit a tree during an emergency landing, in [[Marlborough, New Hampshire]].<ref name=obit>''[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2wIqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7icEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1866,405329&dq=steamtown&hl=en Millionaire Dies in Plane Crash]''.

When questions about Steamtown, USA in New England are posed, the official response of the National Park Service is:
<blockquote>Steamtown National Historic Site was created in 1986 to preserve the history of steam railroading in America, concentrating on the era 1850 through 1950. This is the mission of the park. The park was not created to preserve the history of Steamtown USA. Our site does touch on the history of railroad preservation, specifically in our History Museum. The work of F. Nelson Blount, creator of the former Steamtown USA, and other pioneers of the steam preservation movement, is a part (albeit a small part) of the story Steamtown NHS has been charged with preserving.<ref>National Parks Service, U.S. Department of Interior.

===Move to Scranton===
Self-syndicated newspaper columnist Michael McManus once said that his goal in writing his weekly column was "to suggest answers to problems of the old industrial states."<ref name= McManus2>McManus, Michael. ''[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HgwhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TnMFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4279,3633729&dq=steamtown&hl=en Three Proposals That Didn't Die]''. Schenectady Gazette. June 14, 1983. Pg. 28. Accessed July 15, 2010</ref> In March 1982 a substantial article by McManus appeared in the ''[[Bangor Daily News]]''. In the article, McManus proposed several reasons why a city, like [[Chicago]], [[Pittsburgh]], or [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], might benefit from a tourist attraction like Steamtown. McManus went on to explain why the business was failing in Vermont: past failed management, an isolated location and the lack of signs on [[Interstate 91]], which the state opposed.<ref name= McManus /> Moreover, the roof of the largest storage shed on the property had collapsed under heavy snow the previous winter, damaging several pieces of equipment.<ref name= McManus /> Among the injured were CP Rail No. 1293, which had served on Vermont's "Bicentennial Train" and on the movie ''[[Terror Train]]'' (1979),<ref name="SteamtownSHS1293">Chapell, Gordon.

Accessed July 13, 2010</ref>

Asked by McManus to describe the value of the Steamtown collection, Jim Boyd, editor of ''[[Railfan]]'' magazine, said, "Everything there is no longer obtainable anywhere, whether it is the "Big Boy" [Union Pacific No. 4012] or the Rahway Valley No. 15, a nice-sized locomotive any museum would give a right arm for. Most of the other large collections do not have any serviceable equipment." <ref name= McManus /> McManus added "What is at stake is more than tourism and jobs. It is a significant part of America's past before the welder's torch is turned on the likes of the 1877 'Prince of Liege', the rare [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] diamond stack, etc. The steel alone is worth $3 million."<ref name= McManus />

In June 1983, McManus wrote about Steamtown again, this time announcing that Scranton had taken his suggestion. He said that [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], and [[Willimantic, Connecticut]], had also vied for the collection. "But on May 24, Scranton signed a contract to get it, pledging to raise $2 million to cover the cost of moving 40 ancient steam engines and 60 cars, few of which are operable, and to create a museum."<ref name= McManus2 /> On October 23, 1983, Steamtown sponsored its last Vermont excursion, using Canadian Pacific 1246 to pull a "dozen or so cars" on a {{convert|100|mi|adj=on}} round trip from Riverside station to [[Ludlow (village), Vermont|Ludlow, Vermont]],<ref name= NYTimes>Van Gelder, Lawrence.

The establishment of Steamtown as a NHS caused controversy. On November 23, 1991, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an editorial that took up one side of the debate. The article, by Michael deCourcy Hinds, said, "The provision for the park was inserted into a huge appropriations bill at a late-night meeting near the end of the legislative session in October 1986. Congressional authorizing committees, which are charged with setting policy and reviewing such proposals, were bypassed, and the Park Service did not conduct its customary two-year review of proposed new parks."<ref name= Hinds /> Hinds also pointed out that "a number of historians and museum curators around the nation call Steamtown a second-rate collection of trains on a third-rate site. They say that while such historic recreations have a place, the Federal Government should not be financing them simply because influential members of Congress want them for their districts."<ref name= Hinds /> Hinds wrote that [[James M. Ridenour]], director of the Park Service, said that Steamtown was among other projects that the agency neither needed nor wanted, adding that the same collection was rejected by them when it was still in Vermont because it "lacked historic importance".<ref name= Hinds /> Aside from the $73 million that had at that point been proposed for the development of the project, there would also be a projected annual operation cost of $6.5 million. In a December 17, 1991, follow-up article, it was reported that the development appropriation had been capped at $53 million. This article said that the Steamtown project had siphoned resources "from the Park Service's worthier, maintenance-starved projects."<ref name= Steamroller>''[http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/17/opinion/topics-of-the-times-the-steamtown-steamroller.html Topic of the Times; The Steamtown Steamroller]''. New York Times, December 17, 1991. Accessed July 16</ref>

[[William W. Scranton]], former [[governor of Pennsylvania]] and descendant of the founders of Scranton, along with J. A. Panuska, president of the [[University of Scranton]], responded to Hinds' article with a letter to the editor that was published January 8, 1992. The letter said that the statement, first made by a former Smithsonian curator, that "Steamtown was a second-rate collection on a third-rate site," was unfounded.<ref name= letter /> Scranton and Panuska added, "The collection of 29 steam engines and 82 other railroad cars and equipment is the third largest in the country, the only one available for commemorating the industrialization of America in a historic setting."<ref name= letter/> They said that the 19th-century American [[Industrial Revolution]] was under-represented in the National Parks system<ref name= letter/> and further charged:
<blockquote>Scranton is the only city in the Eastern United States with the vestiges of the era of industrialization (1840-1920) in plain sight, 40 acres in the middle of downtown, with car shops, locomotive shops, roundhouse, turntable, grand passenger station, a working yard, iron furnaces, passenger excursions <U+2014> the whole works and a restored coal mine nearby. There is no other site like it. This city [Scranton] was founded because of its iron ore and its ability to produce rails (previously imported from England), followed by its graduation to a coal and steel economy. It is a graphic demonstration of the industrial period of our country, an excellent site for Americans to learn about their history.<ref name= letter/></blockquote>

The site they were referring to had belonged to the DL&W. On the property were 13 buildings, built between 1865 and 1937 and all listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name= Kissel /> DL&W owned the route of the ''[[Phoebe Snow (character)|Phoebe Snow]]''. ''Phoebe Snow'' was the name of a fictional character in an advertisement for the DL&W's use of clean-burning [[anthracite]] coal.

Accessed July 19, 2010</ref> The DL&W merged with the [[Erie Railroad]] in 1960 to form the [[Erie Lackawanna Railway]] and "kept the ''Phoebe Snow'' name alive even after it converted to diesel locomotives in the 1950s."<ref name= Greenhouse /> Later, some of the trains that ran on the DL&W became known individually as the ''Phoebe Snow''.{{Citation needed|reason= July, 2010|date=July 2010}} The railroad passed to [[Conrail]], and the site was eventually bought from them by the city of Scranton as the site for Steamtown, USA. {{Citation needed|reason= July, 2010|date=July 2010}} According to Linda Greenhouse of ''The New York Times'', "Scranton was once served by five railroads, an almost unthinkable luxury for a city of just over 80,000 people. The passenger trains stopped decades ago, but one memory remains: the Lackawanna's elegant station, just up the street from Steamtown, completed in 1908 and converted into a hotel through a public-private partnership in 1983."<ref name= Greenhouse />

In April 1992, ''[[Newsweek]]'' printed an excerpt from a soon-to-be published book about [[pork-barrel]] politics called ''Adventures in Porkland''. It said of Representative McDade's leadership in securing funds for Steamtown: <blockquote>McDade has achieved the dream of most pork-barrel congressmen, a living memorial, indeed two: the [[University of Scranton]]'s new Joseph M. McDade Center for Technology and Applied Research, and the county's [[McDade Park]], with its Anthracite Coal Museum. But the congressman's crowning achievement is a historic theme park called Steamtown.<ref name= Newsweek /></blockquote> Aside from the government spending and the tactics used to ensure the spending, the article repeated the charge that the collection was second-rate. It went on to say that at the site there was little evidence of the money that had been spent; several of the pieces were from the 1940s and 1950s, as opposed to the 19th century, which was the time period that was supposedly being preserved; that some of the better pieces of equipment were actually foreign, [[Canada|Canadian]], to be precise; other museums, already in existence, were already fulfilling the historical mission of Steamtown; and that other NPS projects like [[Yosemite]] and [[Yellowstone]] were in desperate need of funding.<ref name= Newsweek /> Nevertheless, in 1992, the House of Representatives voted against dropping the project from the NPS and, instead voted to add an additional $14 million to its funding.<ref name= House>''[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=r_4wAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jeEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2424,2501395&dq=steamtown&hl=en House Rejects Steamtown Proposal]''.

By 1994, one of the earlier skeptics of the Steamtown project, ''Rail Fan and Railroad Magazine'' editor Mike DelVecchio, who had visited the site, had changed sides in the debate saying, "When it is finished, Steamtown will be the only place in America that can recreate the experience of mainline steam railroading."<ref name="Barcousky"/> The director of Steamtown, Roger G. Kennedy, said, "those who concentrated on the pork-barrel politics of the development of the park were ignorant of the history."<ref name= Barcousky /> Len Barcousky, writing for the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', described that history saying: "It was steam locomotives that unified the nation in the century between 1850 and 1950. Maintained in giant [[roundhouse]]s in a hundred cities like Scranton, the smoke belching engines carried the people and the goods that made possible the Industrial Revolution."<ref name= Barcousky />

In June 1995, the Steamtown NHS was ready for its grand opening. [[Michigan]]'s only surviving steam locomotive, no. 1225, was to arrive on July 1 for the occasion.<ref name= Grnak>Grnak, Robert, ''[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=s28iAAAAIBAJ&sjid=L60FAAAAIBAJ&pg=3249,2362324&dq=steamtown&hl=en Steam Locomotive 1225 to Gain National Exposure at Pennsylvania Activity]''.

Despite the hardships and criticism, Steamtown NHS established itself in 1995, and by November of that year ''The New York Times'' had printed a favorable review written by [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] correspondent Linda Greenhouse, who had visited the site with her husband and daughter that year. Greenhouse said of Steamtown, "The pleasure of the park is to see trains not only as one might see them in a museum but to see them in motion. Steamtown is a dynamic museum, with locomotives moving regularly from the yard into the park's architectural centerpiece, the roundhouse".<ref name= Greenhouse />

With an annual operating cost of $5.2 million, the federal government's total investment in Steamtown was $176 million, by 2008. Visitor attendance had peaked during its opening year, 1995, at 212,000 and had declined to 61,178 in 2006. Many of the locomotives and passenger cars were in need of [[asbestos]] removal.<ref name= AP /> Asbestos has been linked to various diseases including [[asbestosis]], [[peritoneal mesothelioma]] and other fatal lung conditions.<ref name= meso>''[http://www.mesotheliomanews.com/2008/09/24/trouble-on-the-tracks-at-steamtown-national-historic-site/ Trouble on the Tracks at Steamtown NHS]''.

Accessed July 24, 2010</ref> The federal government pledged $1.5 million for its removal, to be disbursed in 2011, and more money for restoration of the equipment, providing the money is matched by non-federal funds.<ref name= AP />
