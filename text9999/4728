'''State Route&nbsp;213''' (SR&nbsp;213) is the shortest [[State highways in Washington|state highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. The {{convert|0.35|mi|km|2|adj=on}} long unsigned highway serves [[Malott, Washington|Malott]], a community in [[Okanogan County, Washington|Okanogan County]]. Extending from {{nowrap|[[U.S. Route 97 in Washington|U.S. Route 97]]}} (US&nbsp;97) over the [[Okanogan River]] via a bridge to First Avenue in Malott, the roadway is semi-complete, as state law designates that the road should extend to {{nowrap|[[Washington State Route 20|SR 20]]}} southwest of [[Okanogan, Washington|Okanogan]]. First appearing in a map in 1954, SR&nbsp;213 originated as a branch of {{nowrap|[[Primary State Highway 16 (Washington)|Primary State Highway 16]]}} (PSH&nbsp;16) in 1959 and later '''SR&nbsp;20&nbsp;Spur''' in 1964. SR&nbsp;20&nbsp;Spur became SR&nbsp;213 in 1973 because {{nowrap|[[Washington State Route 20 Spur|another SR 20 Spur]]}} was recently established in [[Anacortes, Washington|Anacortes]].

==Route description==

SR&nbsp;213 originates at an intersection with {{nowrap|[[U.S. Route 97 in Washington|U.S. Route 97]]}} (US&nbsp;97) south of [[Malott, Washington|Malott]]. Traveling northwest and turning northeast, the unsigned roadway crosses the [[Cascade and Columbia River Railroad]] and the [[Okanogan River]] near the [[confluence]] of the Okanogan River and Loup Loup Creek.<ref name="rail">{{cite map |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |title=Washington State Rail System |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/NR/rdonlyres/1DFCBFA0-1A9D-4838-A74F-7841BF22E9C3/0/Railmap_update_Sept2008.pdf |year=2008 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref><ref name="atlas">{{cite map |publisher=[[Thomas Bros.]], [[Rand McNally]] |title=Pacific Northwest: Washington, Oregon, Western Idaho, Southwestern British Columbia |edition=6th |year=2004 |cartography=[[NAVTEQ]] |scale=1 inch = 3,800 feet |series=The Thomas Guide |page=104 |section=C3 |accessdate=12 August 2009 |isbn=0-528-99511-1}}</ref> After crossing the Okanogan River, the highway enters Malott and terminates at First Avenue,<ref name="map">{{google maps |title=State Route 213 |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Unknown+road&daddr=B+and+O+Rd&hl=en&geocode=FaSq4AId0HLd-A%3BFby64AId9m_d-A&mra=ls&sll=48.28024,-119.704865&sspn=0.005184,0.009624&ie=UTF8&z=17 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref><ref name="WSDOT2008">{{cite map |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |year=2008 |edition=2008<U+2013>09 edition |title=Washington State Highways, 2008<U+2013>2009 |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/NR/rdonlyres/87105CAD-83A9-49A7-80F3-5719637C1E2D/0/FrontMapBig.pdf |section=C6 |cartography=[[United States Geological Survey]] |scale=1:842,000 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref> although state law dictates that eventually the road will be extended to {{nowrap|[[Washington State Route 20|SR 20]]}} southwest of [[Okanogan, Washington|Okanogan]].<ref name="rcw"/> An estimated [[average annual daily traffic|daily average]] of 740&nbsp;motorists utilized SR&nbsp;213 in 2008.<ref name="2008atr">{{cite web |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/mapsdata/tdo/PDF_and_ZIP_Files/Annual_Traffic_Report_2008.pdf |title=2008 Annual Traffic Report |author=Washington State Department of Transportation |year=2008 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref>
