==Character Development==
===Characterisation===
The ''[[Herald Sun]]'' described Samantha as a "smart, successful lawyer".<ref name="Peace">{{cite news|title=Peace of mind|last=Vickery|first=Colin|date=4 June 2008|work=[[Herald Sun]]|publisher=[[The Herald and Weekly Times]]|accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref> [[Network Ten]] describe Sam as "long-suffering" and an "off-the-rails lawyer", they also call the character "fiery".<ref name="Back"/> During the Dan, Libby and Sam triangle, ''Daytime Confidential'' said Sam would "go to incredible lengths to get Dan".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daytimeconfidential.com/2009/01/neighbours-2009-spoiler-preview|title=Neighbours 2009 Spoiler Preview|first=Johnathon|date=18 January 2009|publisher=Daytime Confidential|accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref>

===Bipolar disorder===
One of Sam's main storylines was her battle with bipolar disorder, which was triggered by a miscarriage.<ref name="Peace"/> The storyline required careful planning as ''Neighbours'' production team wanted to portray the issue sensitivley.<ref name="sane">{{cite web|title=Neighbours' sensitive handling of bipolar disorder|url=http://www.sane.org/good_news_files_2008/neighbours%92_sensitive_handling_of_bipolar_disorder.html|publisher=[[SANE Australia]]|accessdate=23 June 2010|date=28 August 2008}}</ref> Buchanan whose real life brother suffers from the illness, worked closely with charity [[SANE Australia]] to carry out the relevant research.<ref name="sane"/> With their help the scriptwriters, production team and Buchanan worked to portray the illness as accurate as, possible.<ref name="sane"/> Buchanan's brother, Miles, suffers from the illness and is a spokesperson for the charity. He spoke of his delight that ''Neighbours'' decided to include such a storyline and praised it for being "gripping".<ref name="sane"/> Buchanan immediately turned to her brother when she got the role of Samantha and he helped her with her portrayal of the illness.<ref name="Peace"/> Buchanan herself felt that she had done the storyline justice, during an interview with the charity she stated: "I think they<U+2019>ve done a great job, the writers really did their research beforehand; they spent time with people who have bipolar disorder, and worked closely with SANE Australia. They haven<U+2019>t glossed over it."<ref name="sane"/> ''Neighbours<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' executive producer [[Susan Bower]] said that it was important to represent the character dealing with bipolar disorder accurately.<ref name="Peace"/> She said "As a matter of course, any storylines involving health, police or adoption issues need to be properly researched. We have a responsibility because misinformation can cause a lot of problems, but proper information can do a lot of good. In the end, proper research also helps you tell the story better than making it up".<ref name="Peace"/>
