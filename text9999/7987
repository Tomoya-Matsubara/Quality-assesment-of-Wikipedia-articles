The '''''Rivadavia'' class''' was a two-ship [[ship class|group]] of [[battleship]]s (Spanish: ''acorazados'') designed by the American [[Fore River Shipyard|Fore River Shipbuilding Company]] for the [[Argentine Navy]]. Named {{Ship|ARA|Rivadavia||2}} and {{Ship|ARA|Moreno||2}} after important figures in Argentine history, they were Argentina's counter to Brazil's two {{Sclass|Minas Geraes|battleship|1}}s.

In 1904, Brazil scrapped a previous naval building program in favor of an order that included two [[dreadnought]]s, despite signs that such an action would spark a South American naval arms race. To counter this acquisition by a major rival, Argentina began [[call for bids|seeking bids]] for at least two dreadnoughts in 1908. Over the next two years, multiple shipbuilders from five countries vied for the contracts, complemented by efforts from their respective governments. Argentina was able to play this hyper-competitive environment to its own advantage by rejecting all of the initial proposals and calling for new ones that required the best aspects of each. They then repeated this process, despite complaints from shipbuilders that their trade secrets were being given away. The contracts were awarded to the lowest bidder, Fore River, in early 1910. This move shocked the European bidders, but could largely be explained by the American steel trust's ability to produce steel at a much lower cost than any other country.

During their construction, the Argentine battleships were frequently subject of rumors involving their sale to a foreign country, especially after the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]]. Under diplomatic pressure not to sell, Argentina kept the two ships. Throughout their careers, ''Rivadavia'' and ''Moreno'' were based in [[Puerto Belgrano]] and served principally as [[training ship]]s and diplomatic envoys. They were modernized in the United States in 1924 and 1925 and were inactive for much of the [[World War II|Second World War]] due to Argentina's neutrality. [[Wiktionary:stricken|Struck]] from the navy lists on 1 February 1957, ''Rivadavia'' was [[ship breaking|scrapped]] in Italy beginning in 1959. ''Moreno'' was struck on 1 October 1956 and was towed to Japan in 1957 for scrapping in what was then the world's longest tow (96 days).

== Background ==
In 1902, Argentine<U+2013>Chilean territorial disputes over the boundary of [[Patagonia]] and control of the [[Beagle Channel]] were settled via British mediation. As part of the treaty that ended the dispute, restrictions were placed on the navies of both countries. The British [[Royal Navy]] bought two {{Sclass|Swiftsure|battleship|0}} [[pre-dreadnought]] battleships that were being built for Chile, and Argentina sold its two [[Kasuga class cruiser|''Rivadavia''-class]] [[armored cruiser]]s under construction in Italy to Japan.<ref name="Hore">Hore, ''Battleships of World War I'', 91.</ref>

By 1904, however, Brazil<U+2014>the largest country in South America in both size and population<U+2014>began to seriously consider upgrading its navy to compete with Argentina and Chile.<ref name=Livermore32>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 32.</ref> [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo (state)#Early Twentieth Century|Soaring demand]] for coffee and [[rubber boom|rubber]] brought the Brazilian economy an influx of revenue,<ref name=Sondhaus216>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare'', 216.</ref><ref name=Conways403>Schenia, "Brazil," 403.</ref> which paid for 1904 $31,250,000{{#tag:ref|Argentines use "$" to represent their [[Argentine peso|peso]] and "US$" or similar for the U.S. dollar; however, "$" generally means "dollar" in English sources and in this article.|group=N}} naval repair scheme, a substantial amount for the time period. The bill authorized 28 ships, including three battleships and three armored cruisers.<ref name=Sondhaus216/> It was not possible to [[keel laying|lay down]] the battleships until 1906, the same year the trend-setting {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} was constructed.  This ship prompted the Brazilians to cancel their battleship plans in favor of two so-called "[[dreadnought]]s".<ref name=Livermore32/> These dreadnoughts<U+2014>designed to carry the heaviest armament in the world at the time<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0CE4D9123EE233A2575AC0A96E9C946997D6CF Germany may buy English warships]," ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1 August 1908, C8.</ref> and later described as "the last word in heavy battleship design" by ''[[Scientific American]]''<ref>"The Brazilian Battleship "Minas Geraes"," ''[[Scientific American]]'' '''102''', (19 March 1910): 240<U+2013>241. {{ISSN|0036-8733}}.</ref><U+2014>came as an abrupt shock to the Argentine and Chilean navies. Historian Robert Schenia comments that those two ships alone "outclassed the entire [elderly] Argentinian fleet."<ref>Schenia, "Argentina," 400.</ref>

Debates raged in Argentina over the wisdom of acquiring dreadnoughts to counter Brazil's. The cabinet was in favor, despite a probable cost of over $9,740,000,{{#tag:ref|In British [[pounds sterling]], these figures are equal to <U+00A3>2,000,000, or <U+00A3>158,000,000 in 2008.

The American ambassador to Brazil sent a [[cablegram]] to the [[U.S. State Department]], warning them of the destabilizing effects that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race.<ref>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 32<U+2013>33.</ref>

Despite American entreaties to preclude the naval arms race, Brazil continued development on the ships. This, combined with renewed border disputes, particularly in the [[R<U+00ED>o de la Plata|River Plate]] (''R<U+00ED>o de la Plata'', literally "Silver River") area, spurred Argentina to move forward with plans for their own battleships. Inflamed by newspaper editors, the public was now fully supportive of a naval building program. While an early plan called for $35,000,000 to be invested<U+2014>$7,000,000 from foreign loans<U+2014>a $55,000,000 plan was adopted in August 1908.{{#tag:ref|In 1904 terms, $7,000,000 is <U+00A3>1,440,000; $35,000,000 is <U+00A3>7,190,000; and $55,000,000 is <U+00A3>11,300,000.

[[File:Argentine Rivadavia Class Battleship 1912.jpg|thumb|right|''Rivadavia'' under construction, 2 December 1912]]
Proposals from shipbuilders for two dreadnoughts (along with a possible third, to match Brazil should a third ship be ordered) and twelve destroyers were solicited in 1908 by [[Call for bids|open tender]].<ref name=Conways>Schenia, "Argentina," 401.</ref><ref>Schenia, ''Latin America'', 82.</ref><ref name=Whitley18>Whitley, ''Battleships of World War Two'', 18.</ref> In order to ensure that the designs reflected the most modern practices, the requirements were intentionally vague.<ref name=Conways/><ref name=Schenia83>Schenia, ''Latin America'', 83.</ref>

Fifteen shipyards from the United States, Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy began bidding on the battleships.<ref name=Conways/><ref name=Whitley18/><ref name=Schenia83/> Diplomatic pressure to give the contracts was brought to bear from all these countries, especially the first three.<ref name=Livermore34>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 34.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Although the United States had done little to promote American armament interests in Latin America under President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]; this was drastically reversed after the election of [[William Howard Taft]] in 1912, most notably demonstrated with the creation of the [[Division of Latin American Affairs]] and the appointment of [[Charles H. Sherrill (ambassador)|Charles H. Sherrill]] to be the [[United States Ambassador to Argentina|American minister to Argentina]]. As part of this, American bankers were persuaded to offer a $10,000,000 loan to Argentina to help pay for the dreadnoughts should they be built in the United States.<ref name=Livermore34/>|group=N}} Even with this assistance, industry leaders in the United States believed that they had no chance in the bidding without active cooperation from their government, as Europe was the traditional arms supplier to Argentina (and to all of South America).<ref>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 35<U+2013>36.</ref> Even when this was given, including the removal of import tariffs on [[hides]] from Argentina, promises for additional concessions if American shipbuilders were selected,<ref name=Livermore36>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 36.</ref> and an offer to include the most technologically advanced [[fire-control system]] and [[torpedo tube]]s available on the Argentine battleships, the United States was widely viewed as a non-contender.<ref name=Schenia83/> Historian [[Seward W. Livermore]] remarked:

{{quote|Opposition to the United States was formidable. The naval commission was pro-British; the vice-president of the republic, [[Roque S<U+00E1>enz Pe<U+00F1>a]], favored Italy, where he had been the Argentine envoy for many years; and the minister of war wanted the contracts to go to Germany, so as to standardize the military and naval equipment of the country.<ref name=Livermore36/>}}

The president of the [[Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company]] believed that the United States would not receive contracts due to what he saw as a large amount of European meddling in Argentina:

{{quote|The political influence of foreign powers is being exerted in a very forceful manner to turn the business to English and Continental firms; the King of Italy, the German Emperor, and the force of English diplomacy are being made use of; and American firms will have very little consideration, I fear, unless our government will exert some very powerful influence in favor of this country.<ref>Quoted in Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 35.</ref>}}

The United States, however, found an ally in Buenos Aires' main daily newspaper, ''[[La Prensa (Buenos Aires)|La Prensa]]''. The owner, editor, and naval editor were all in favor of acquiring American-designed dreadnoughts. In addition, the paper found evidence of British wrongdoing in a related naval contract. Under public pressure, the naval commission was forced to reconsider its original list, which had placed Italy first and Britain second. It now featured the United States first, Britain second, and Italy last.<ref name="Livermore36"/>

In a surprise move, the Argentine naval commission then threw out all of the opening tenders and called for another round of bidding; they simultaneously updated the specifications to include what were judged to be the best aspects of all the plans.<ref name=Schenia83/><ref name=Livermore37>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 37.</ref> The competitors were given three weeks to come up with new designs and cost estimates.

The commission found that the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company bid was lowest on one battleship, and the [[Fore River Shipyard|Fore River Shipbuilding Company]] was lowest on the other. Despite a British attempt to allow the [[Armstrong Whitworth]]-[[Vickers Limited|Vickers]] team to lower their price by $570,000,{{#tag:ref|This equals <U+00A3>117,000 in 1910, or $9,880,000 / <U+00A3>8,870,000 in 2008.|group=N}} prompt American diplomacy granting various assurances regarding recent events between the United States and Brazil, the upcoming 1910 [[Pan-American Conference]], and a guarantee of American participation in the Argentine centennial celebrations secured the battleship contracts for Fore River on 21 January 1910.<ref name=Livermore38>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 38.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The aforementioned twelve destroyers were divided up between Britain, France, and Germany.<ref name=Livermore38/><ref name="America builds">"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9803E3D81730E233A25750C2A9679C946196D6CF America to Build Argentine Ships]," ''The New York Times'', 23 January 1910, C4.</ref>|group=N}} The maximum price Fore River tendered, $10,700,000, underbid the British by more than $973,000.{{#tag:ref|These figures equal <U+00A3>2,190,000 in 1910, or $246,000,000 / <U+00A3>211,000,000 in 2008; <U+00A3>200,000 in 1910, or $22,500,000 / <U+00A3>19,200,000 in 2008.|group=N}} Italy's tender was just $48,600 more, but their ship's [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|2000|LT|t|0}} smaller, the [[belt armor]] was {{convert|2|in|mm}} thinner, and the top speed was slightly slower.<ref name="Evening Post"/><ref name=Alger595>Philip Alger, "[http://books.google.com/books?id=tiJKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA595#v=onepage&q&f=false Professional Notes; Ships of War, Budgets and Personnel; Argentine Republic]," ''Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute'' 31, no. 1 (1910): 595.</ref>{{#tag:ref|$48,600 is equivalent to <U+00A3>10,000 in 1910, or $1,090,000 or <U+00A3>962,000 in 2008.|group=N}}

''Rivadavia'' was built by Fore River at its shipyard in Massachusetts; as called for in the final contract, ''Moreno'' was [[subcontractor|subcontracted]] out to the [[New York Shipbuilding|New York Shipbuilding Corporation]] of New Jersey.<ref name=Schenia83/> The steel for the ships was largely supplied by the [[Bethlehem Steel Company]] of Pennsylvania,<ref name="Evening Post">"[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=EP19100323.2.42 Argentine Navy; Dreadnought Orders]," ''Evening Post'', London, 23 March 1910, 4.</ref> which, due to their ability to produce steel at a lower price than other nations, was an integral cost-saving measure.<ref name=Livermore39/> The Secretary of the Argentine Naval Commission, the body which chose the final design, said the reason the American tender was lower than that of the English was that "steel for construction work and armor-plating is a great deal cheaper in the United States than in England.

A third dreadnought, provided for in the contract, was strongly supported by Argentina and by U.S. diplomats during 1910, while the ''Minas Geraes'' class was still under construction. ''La Prensa'' and one of its rivals, ''[[La Naci<U+00F3>n|La Argentina]]'', heavily advocated a third ship; the latter even started a petition to raise money for a new battleship.<ref name=Livermore44>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 44.</ref> An American diplomat wrote back to the United States that "this newspaper rivalry promises the early conclusion of a movement which means a third battleship whether by public subscription or by Government funds."<ref>Quoted in Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 44.</ref> However, Brazil's 21<U+2013>26 November [[Revolt of the Whip|''Revolta da Chibata'']] ("Revolt of the Whip"), in which the three most powerful ships in the fleet (the battleships {{Ship|Brazilian battleship|Minas Geraes||2}}, {{Ship|Brazilian battleship|S<U+00E3>o Paulo||2}}, and the cruiser {{Ship|Brazilian cruiser|Bahia||2}}) along with an older [[coast defence ship|coast defense ship]] (''Deodoro'') violently rebelled, crushed the previous sentiment for a new battleship.<ref name=Livermore44/><ref>Schenia, ''Latin America'', 104<U+2013>107.</ref> About two years later in October 1912, a third dreadnought was authorized by Argentina in case Brazil's [[HMS Agincourt (1913)|''Rio de Janeiro'']] was completed and delivered.

== International reaction ==
The choice of Fore River came as a complete surprise to the European bidders.<ref name=Schenia83/> Britain's reaction in particular was scathing: [[John H. Biles]], a [[naval architect]], decried the bidding process as "unethical"<ref>Quoted in Schenia, ''Latin America'', 83.</ref> and remarked:

{{quote|... it may be presumed that everything  ... good in the first proposals [was] seized upon by the Argentine authorities and asked for in the new design. This second request went not only to British builders but to all the builders of the world, and in this way it is exceedingly probable that a serious leakage of ideas and practice of our ships was disseminated through the world by the Argentine government.... The third inquiry that was issued showed to all the builders of the world what has been eliminated or modified in the second inquiry; and so the process of leakage went merrily on, and with it that of the education of foreign builders and the Argentine government.<ref name=Schenia84>Quoted in Schenia, ''Latin America'', 84.</ref>}}

Various British newspapers also cried foul. The ''[[Evening Standard]]'' believed that as "Argentina's greatest creditor and greatest client",<ref>Quoted in Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 39.</ref> Britain ought to have been awarded the two ships. ''[[The Times]]'' took a different track, accusing American shipbuilders of slashing prices to an obscene degree,{{#tag:ref|Ironically, on 17 January 1909, the ''[[New York Herald]]'' had opined that the British would eventually win the Argentine contracts by utilizing this practice.<ref>Schenia, ''Latin America'', 354.</ref>|group=N}} and accusing the government of exerting undue diplomatic pressure to obtain the contracts.<ref name=Livermore39/>

[[File:ARA Rivadavia speed trials 2.jpg|thumb|240px|''Rivadavia'' on her speed trials]]
New Zealand's ''[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|Evening Post]]'' noted that the United States had previously built major warships for other countries, including Russia's and Britain's ally Japan, and commented, "The severity of the blow to England rests in ... the amount of English capital in [Argentina]", possibly echoing the ''Evening Standard''{{'}}s argument. They referred to a "startling" fact printed by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'': the steel used for the armor of the American design was obtained for a much lower price. With Bethlehem's ability to produce it at <U+00A3>8 less per ton than British foundries, a cost savings of more than 10% in steel over the British ship could be realized.<ref name="Evening Post"/>

Germany asserted that the United States was given the opportunity to view the other nations' tenders and lower their price accordingly. Germany also alleged that the United States had secured the deal by pledging to come to Argentina's defense should they become embroiled in a military conflict.<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A00E0DC1E31E233A25755C2A9679D946096D6CF Accuse America of Unfair Competition]," ''The New York Times'', 26 November 1911, C4.</ref>

''The New York Times'' noted that with Argentina's and Brazil's dreadnought orders, countries in North and South America were building the five biggest [[capital ships]] in the world (Brazil's ''Rio de Janeiro'', Argentina's ''Rivadavia'' and ''Moreno'', and the United States' {{USS|New York|BB-34|2}} and {{USS|Texas|BB-35|2}}) in addition to seven of the ten largest (including the United States' {{USS|Wyoming|BB-32|2}} and {{USS|Arkansas|BB-33|2}}).<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D02E1DD1339E433A25752C1A9649D946196D6CF Our Navy Close to England's Now]," ''The New York Times'', 11 December 1910, 8.</ref> Shortly after ''Rivadavia'' had completed her trials, the U.S. Navy's [[Board of Inspection and Survey]] remarked that  she "handle[d] remarkably well ... with comparatively minor modifications the vessel would practically meet the requirements of our own vessels."<ref name=QuotedConways>Quoted in Schenia, "Argentina," 402.</ref> The Board of Inspection was less pleased with the wing turrets, stating that "while theoretically the ''Rivadavia'' has an ahead and astern fire of six guns, this is not so in reality, as it is almost certain that the blast from the waist turrets would dish in the smokepipes and damage the uptakes."<ref name=QuotedConways/>

== Possible sale ==
After Brazil sold ''Rio de Janeiro'' to the Ottoman Empire, Argentina began to actively seek a buyer for their two ships so the profits could be invested in education. In the tension that preceded the First World War, there were many suitors. The United States, however, abhorred the idea of the their latest technological advances falling into the hands of a possible future combat opponent. While the contract allowed the United States Navy an option to acquire the ships if a deal was reached with a third nation, the navy did not want the ships; with the rapid advances in dreadnought technology, such as the "[[all or nothing (armor)|all or nothing]]" armor arrangement, even new ships like ''Rivadavia'' and ''Moreno'' were seen as outmoded.<ref>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 45<U+2013>46.</ref>

Three bills directing that the battleships be sold were introduced into the [[Argentine National Congress]] in the summer of 1914, but all were defeated. Still, soon after the beginning of the First World War, the German ambassador to Argentina alleged to the U.S. State Department that Britain's Royal Navy was going to take over the ships as soon as the ships reached the River Plate, and the British put diplomatic pressure on the United States to try to ensure the ships were not sold to any other country (as this new country could in turn sell them to Germany).{{#tag:ref|This was possibly referencing an earlier (March 1914) incident where French bankers<U+2014>given direction by Russia<U+2014>offered Argentina twice the amount they paid for the ''Rivadavia''-class ships so that the ships could be turned over to Greece.<ref name=Livermore46>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 47.</ref> Schenia mentions a 1913 Russian attempt to purchase both Argentine and both Chilean battleships, but gives no specifics.<ref>Schenia, ''Latin America'', 355.</ref>|group=N}} The United States, worried that its neutrality would not be respected and its technology would be released for study to a foreign country, diplomatically pressured Argentina to keep the ships, which it eventually did.<ref>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 46<U+2013>47.</ref>

=== General characteristics ===
The two ships of the ''Rivadavia'' class were {{convert|594|ft|9|in|m}} [[length overall|overall]] and {{convert|585|ft|m}} [[Length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]]. They had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|98|ft|4.5|in|m}}, a normal [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|27|ft|8.5|in|m}}, and [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|27500|LT|t|lk=on|abbr=off}} [[Displacement (ship)#Normal displacement|normally]] and {{convert|30100|LT|t|abbr=off}} [[Displacement (ship)#Full or deep load or loaded displacement|at full load]]. The ships were staffed by 130 officers and about 1000 enlisted men.<ref name=Conways/>

=== Armament ===
The ''Rivadavia'' class was equipped with a [[main battery]] of twelve [[12"/50 caliber gun (Argentina)|12-inch/50]] [[caliber#caliber as measurement of length|caliber]] guns, a secondary battery of twelve 6-inch (155&nbsp;mm)/50 and twelve  4-inch (102&nbsp;mm)/50 [[Quick-firing gun|QF]], and two 21-inch (533&nbsp;mm) [[torpedo tube]]s.<ref name=Conways/>

The 12"/50 was a [[Bethlehem Steel Company|Bethlehem]] development. It was most likely based on the weapon used in the United States' {{Sclass|Wyoming|battleship|1}}, the [[12"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun]]. The twelve guns were mounted in six dual turrets. Four turrets were [[superfire|superfiring]] fore and aft, while the other two were located ''[[Glossary of nautical terms#E|en echelon]]'' in [[Gun turret#Wing turrets|wing turret]]s. The latter weapons could, in theory, fire on a {{degree|180}} range on their respective sides of the hull and {{degree|100}} on the other, but in reality this was not possible, as the [[blast damage]] from the weapons would damage the ship. A more reasonable estimate would be {{degree|90}} on their sides.<ref name=Conways/><ref>Tony DiGiulian, "[http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNARG_12-50_Bethlehem.htm 12"/50 (30.5 cm) Bethlehem]," NavWeaps, accessed 11 June 2010.</ref>

The 6-inch secondary armament was placed in [[casemate]]s, with six on either side of the ship. For protection, they were provided with 6&nbsp;inches of armor. The 4-inch weaponry, intended for use against marauding [[destroyer]]s, was mounted unarmored in various places around the ship, including the main deck, superstructure, and far up near the bow. The torpedo tubes were located underneath the waterline and were loaded in a dedicated compartment.<ref name=Conways/>

Full ammunition loads were 1,440 rounds for the 12-inch guns (120 per gun), 3,600 rounds for the 6-inch (300), 5,600 rounds for the 4-inch (350), and 16 torpedoes manufactured by [[Robert Whitehead|Whitehead]]. To assist the main battery with targeting during a battle, the two ships were equipped with two [[Barr & Stroud]] [[rangefinder]]s that were located above the [[conning tower]]s.<ref name=Conways/>

=== Propulsion ===
''Rivadavia'' and ''Moreno'' used [[John Brown & Company|Brown<U+2013>Curtis]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, powered by 18 [[Babcock & Wilcox]] [[boiler]]s and connected to three [[propeller]]s. With a total output of about {{convert|40000|shp|lk=on}}, the ships were designed to travel at a maximum speed of {{convert|22.5|kn|lk=on}} and may have been capable of slightly more. At speeds of {{convert|11|to|15|kn}}, their endurance ranged from {{convert|11000|to|7000|nmi|lk=on}}, respectively. Their fuel was a [[coal]]<U+2013>[[oil]] mix and the ships carried {{convert|3900|LT|t}} of the former and {{convert|590|LT|t}} of the latter.<ref name=Conways/>

=== Armor ===
Typical of American dreadnoughts at the time, the ''Rivadavia'' class included substantial armor protection. A {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} [[belt armor|belt]] was fitted amidships, covering {{convert|5|ft|m}} above and {{convert|6|ft|m}} below the designed [[waterline]], gradually decreasing towards the bow and stern to {{convert|5|in|mm}} and {{convert|4|in|mm}}, respectively. The gun turrets received heavy armor, including {{convert|12|in|mm}} on the front, {{convert|9|in|mm}} on the sides, {{convert|9.5|in|mm}} on the back, and {{convert|4|in|mm}} on the top. Deck armor consisted of {{convert|.5|in|mm}} [[maraging steel|medium steel]] and {{convert|2|in|mm}} [[carbon steel|nickel steel]].<ref name=Conways/>

=== Influences ===
The ''Rivadavia'' design was very similar to a 1906 proposal from Fore River for an American dreadnought class.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 69.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The plan from the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]] was selected over that of Fore River and was used for the two {{Sclass|Delaware|battleship|6}}s, {{USS|Delaware|BB-28|2}} and {{USS|North Dakota|BB-29|2}}.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 68.</ref>|group=N}} This ship would have mounted a [[main battery]] of fourteen {{Convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} guns in dual turrets (two [[Superfire|superfiring]] fore, two [[Gun turret#Wing turrets|wing]], and three non-superfiring aft), a secondary battery of twenty 4-inch (102&nbsp;mm) guns and four [[torpedo tube]]s on a hull of {{Convert|22000|LT|t|0|lk=on}} that would be capable of {{Convert|21|kn|mph km/h}}.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 68<U+2013>69.</ref>

Foreign practices also bore a large influence on the design; most were acquired through the unique design process of rejecting multiple bids and calling for the best aspects of each.<ref name=Conways/><ref name=Schenia83/> For example, the superfiring arrangement of the main battery was an American innovation, while the wing turrets were similar to British designs of the time. The secondary battery of 6-inch (152&nbsp;mm) guns and the three-shaft system were influenced by German design practices, while the engine and boiler layout was reminiscent of the Italian battleship {{Ship|Italian battleship|Dante Alighieri||2}}.<ref name="Hore"/><ref>Whitley, ''Battleships of World War Two'', 19<U+2013>20.</ref>

[[File:Moreno Battleship LOC 17604.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Moreno'' in [[drydock]], c. 1915]]
{{Ship|ARA|Rivadavia||2}} was named after [[Bernardino Rivadavia]], the first president of [[Argentina]], and was built by [[Fore River Shipyard]]. She was [[keel laying|laid down]] on 25 May 1910, [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 26 August 1911, and completed in December 1914. ''Moreno'' was named after [[Mariano Moreno]], a member of the first Argentine government in May 1810, and was built by [[New York Shipbuilding Corporation]].  She was laid down on 10 July 1910, launched on 23 September 1911, and completed in February 1915.<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9402E4DB163CE633A25757C2A96F9C946096D6CF Moreno Launched For Argentine Navy]," ''The New York Times'', 24 September 1911, 12.</ref><ref name=Whitley21>Whitley, ''Battleships of World War Two'', 21.</ref><ref name="Conways"/> Both ships had engine trouble soon after completion: ''Rivadavia''{{'}}s [[ship commissioning|commissioning]] was delayed due to a damaged turbine,<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9506E2D9143EE033A25754C2A96E9C946596D6CF The Rivadavia Delayed]," ''The New York Times'', 24 August 1914, 7.</ref> while ''Moreno'' had an entire turbine fail while on her trials.<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B05E4DF1738E633A25750C0A9679D946596D6CF New Battleship Disabled]," ''The New York Times'', 3 November 1914, 18.</ref>

The ships finally arrived in Argentina in February and May 1915, respectively.<ref name=Whitley21/> From 1915 to 1939, they participated in training exercises, diplomatic cruises, and stints in the reserve fleet, apart from a brief period in the early 1920s, when the Argentine government had the ships modernized in the United States. Both refits included a conversion from coal to fuel oil, a new fire-control system,<ref name=Whitley21/> and other improvements.<ref name="Conways402"/>  Notable voyages included ''Moreno''{{'}}s visit to Brazil with Argentine president [[Agust<U+00ED>n Pedro Justo]] aboard in 1933 and a later visit in 1934 to mark the centennial of Brazilian independence; ''Rivadavia''{{'}}s and ''Moreno''{{'}}s trip to Europe in 1937, where the two ships visited [[Brest, France|Brest]] (France), [[Wilhelmshaven]], [[Bremen]], and [[Hamburg]] (Germany) between them in addition to ''Moreno''{{'}}s participation in the British [[Fleet review (Commonwealth realms)|Spithead Naval Review]]; and a 1939 visit by both battleships to Brazil with naval cadets embarked<U+2014>destroyers were sent from Argentina to escort them home, as the Second World War had broken out during their stay.<ref name=Whitley21-22>Whitley, ''Battleships of World War Two'', 21<U+2013>22.</ref>

During the war, both ships were mainly inactive due to Argentine neutrality. ''Rivadavia'' undertook a last diplomatic cruise to Trinidad, Venezuela, and Colombia in 1946, but both ships were immobile by 1948. ''Moreno'' was stricken from the naval register on 1 October 1956 and was brought to Japan in 1957 for [[ship breaking|scrapping]] in a then-world-record 96-day tow. ''Rivadavia'' was stricken on 1 February 1957 and scrapped in Italy beginning in 1959.<ref name=Whitley21-22/><ref>"96 Day Tow," ''The New York Times'', 18 August 1957, 61.</ref>
