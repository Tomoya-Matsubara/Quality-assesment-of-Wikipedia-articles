{{Canadian History box}}
The '''[[military history]] of [[Canada]]''' comprises [[millennium|millennia]] of armed actions in the territory encompassing modern Canada, and the role of the [[Canadian Armed Forces|Canadian military]] in [[conflict]]s and [[peacekeeping]] worldwide. For at least 10,000 years, the area that would become Canada was the site of sporadic intertribal wars among [[First Nations]] peoples. Beginning in the 16th century, the arrival of [[Europe]]ans led to conflicts with [[Aboriginal people in Canada|Aboriginal peoples]] and among the invading Europeans in the [[New World]]. Starting in the 17th century, the region was the site of conflicts between the [[France|French]] and the [[Britain|British]] for more than a [[century]], as each allied with various First Nation groups. In 1763, the British emerged victorious and the French were almost completely expelled from [[North America]]. New challenges soon arose when the [[British North America|northern colonies]] chose not to join the [[American Revolution]] and remained loyal to the British crown. The victorious [[United States|Americans]] looked to extend their republic and launched invasions in 1775 and in 1812. On both occasions, the Americans were rebuffed by British and local forces; however, this threat would remain well into the 19th century and partially facilitated [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867.

After Confederation, and amid much controversy, a full-fledged [[Canadian Armed Forces|Canadian military]] was created. Canada, however, remained a British dependency, and Canadian forces joined their British counterparts in the [[Second Boer War]], and the [[First World War]].  Even after greater independence came in 1931, Canada's links to Britain remained strong, and the British once again enjoyed Canadian support in the [[Second World War]].  Since the Second World War, however, Canada has been committed to [[multilateralism]] and has gone to war only within large multinational [[coalition]]s such as in the [[Korean War]], the [[Gulf War]], the [[Kosovo War]], and the [[2001 invasion of Afghanistan]]. Canada has also played an important role in [[UN]] [[peacekeeping]] operations worldwide and has cumulatively committed more troops than any other country. As of 2006, [[Canada]] had the second-highest peacekeeping fatality in the world, behind [[India]]. [http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/fatalities/totals.htm]

==European colonization==
===First Nations===

The first conflicts between Europeans and Native peoples may have occurred around 1006, when parties of [[Norseman|Norsemen]] attempted to establish permanent settlements along the coast of [[Newfoundland]]. According to [[Norse sagas]], the native [[Beothuk]] (called [[skraelings]] or ''skraelingars'' by the Norse) responded so ferociously that the newcomers eventually withdrew and gave up their original intentions to settle. Among later European settlers, the First Nations developed a reputation for violence and savagery. The Natives gave no heed to the idea of [[surrender]], and tended to torture and kill those who did so.{{ref|surr}} 

Prior to the arrival of Europeans, some First Nations warfare tended to be formal and ritualistic, and entail relatively few casualties.{{ref|FN}} But there is also evidence of much more violent warfare, even the complete genocide of some groups by others, such as the total displacement of the [[Dorset (culture)|Dorset]] culture of Newfoundland by the Beothuk mentioned above, as well as by the [[Inuit]] in other regions. There is no evidence of genetic or cultural continuity, so the Dorset are presumed to have simply been wiped out.

After Europeans arrived, fighting tended to be bloodier and more decisive, especially as tribes became caught up in the economic and military rivalries of the European settlers. By the end of the seventeenth century, the East Coast First Nations rapidly adopted the use of [[firearms]], supplanting the traditional [[Bow (weapon)|bow]].{{ref|adopt}} While a skilled [[warrior]] could dodge an incoming arrow, and wooden [[armour]] offered some measure of protection against arrows, nothing could protect them from a [[bullet]]; this significantly increased the number of fatalities. The bloodshed involved in native conflicts was also dramatically increased by the uneven distribution of firearms and [[horses]] among Native groups. 

Native tribes became important allies of both the French and English in the struggle for [[North American]] hegemony during the seventeenth and [[18th century|eighteenth]] centuries; these alliances escalated the violence. [[Scalping]], which is now believed to have existed before the arrival of the Europeans, became more common as the Europeans demanded the presentation of scalps as evidence of their military success.{{ref|scalp}}

===Early French settlements===
The French under [[Samuel de Champlain]] founded a settlements at [[Annapolis Royal]] in 1605 and [[Quebec City|Quebec]] in 1608, quickly coming into conflict with some of the indigenous inhabitants. In the earliest battles, superior French firepower rapidly dispersed massed groups of Natives; Native fortifications also proved useless against French cannon. The Natives thus changed tactics by integrating their [[hunting]] skills and their intimate knowledge of the terrain with their use of firearms obtained from the British; thus, they developed a highly effective form of [[guerrilla warfare]], and were soon a formidable threat to all but the handful of fortified cities. For the first century of its existence the chief threat to the inhabitants of [[New France]] came from the [[Iroquois]] confederacy of Native tribes, and particularly from its eastern-most people, the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawks]]. While the majority of tribes in the region were [[allies]] of the French, the Iroquois were aligned with the British, and received their weapons and support. 

The [[French and Iroquois Wars]] continued intermittently for several decades, with great brutality on both sides. In response to the Iroquois threat, the French government dispatched the [[Carignan-Sali<U+00E8>res Regiment]], the first group of uniformed professional soldiers to set foot on what is today Canadian soil. After peace was attained, these soldiers returned to France and were replaced by the [[Compagnies Franches de la Marine]]. The new troops became permanently stationed in [[New France]], and were therefore Canada's first professional standing army.

==English-French conflict==
Canada was colonized by two major European powers that were historically at odds with each other, and it was inevitable that this age-old tension would spill over into Canada; during the 17th and 18th centuries, there was almost continuous conflict between the colonizing powers in Canada.

===17th century===
Two years after the French founded [[Annapolis Royal]], the English began their first settlement, at [[Jamestown, Virginia]] to the south. From these original footholds, much larger colonies would emerge. The French colony of Quebec on the [[Saint Lawrence River]] was based primarily on the [[fur trade]] and enjoyed only lukewarm support from the [[List of French monarchs|French monarchy]]. It grew only slowly amidst the tough and unyielding geographical and climatic circumstances. The more favourably located English colonies to the south developed more diversified economies and flourished. The result was that by the 1750s, when the economic, political, and military rivalries came to a head in the struggle of the [[Seven Years' War]], the total population of the 13 English colonies was 1,500,000, whereas that of their French rivals to the north was only about 60,000. As a result, the French were forced to employ [[guerrilla warfare]] tactics, largely borrowed from the Natives. This form of fighting became known as ''[[la petite guerre]]''.{{ref|NewFrance}}

During the 17th century, there were several skirmishes between the two [[great power]]s. In 1629, a group of English marauders captured and burnt the stronghold at Qu<U+00E9>bec and carried off Champlain and its other leaders into captivity in England. However, these leaders returned in 1632, rebuilt their capital, and resumed their endeavours. The next most serious threat to Qu<U+00E9>bec in the seventeenth century came in 1690 when, alarmed by the attacks of the ''petite guerre'', the New England colonies sent an armed expedition north, under Sir [[William Phips]], to capture the source of the problems: Qu<U+00E9>bec itself. This expedition was poorly organized and had little time to achieve its objective, having arrived in mid-October, shortly before the St Lawrence would freeze over. The expedition was responsible for eliciting one of the most famous pronouncements in Canadian military history. When called on by Phips to surrender, the aged Governor [[Louis de Buade de Frontenac|Frontenac]], then serving his second term, replied (according to Frontenac's self-congratulatory reports) "I will answer <U+2026> only with the mouths of my cannon and the shots of my muskets." After a single abortive landing on the [[Beauport shore]] to the east of the city, the English force withdrew down the icy waters of the St Lawrence.

In 1695, [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] was called upon to attack the English stations along the Atlantic coast of [[Newfoundland]]. Iberville sailed with his three vessels to [[Placentia]] (Plaisance), the French capital of [[Newfoundland]]. Both English and French fishermen exploited the [[Grand Banks]] fishery from their respective settlements on [[Newfoundland]] under the sanction of the treaty of 1687, but the purpose of the new French expedition of 1696 was nevertheless to expel the English from [[Newfoundland]]. Iberville and his men left [[Placentia]] on [[November 1]], [[1696]] and marched overland to [[Ferryland]], 50 miles south of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St John<U+2019>s]]. Nine days later, Iberville joined with naval forces and both detachments began the march north to the English capital, which surrendered on [[November 30]], [[1696]] following a brief siege. After setting fire to [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St John<U+2019>s]], Iberville&#8217;s Canadians  almost totally destroyed the English fisheries along the eastern shore of [[Newfoundland]]. Small raiding parties terrorized the hamlets hidden away in remote bays and inlets, burning, looting, and taking prisoners. By the end of March 1697, only [[Bonavista]] and [[Carbonear]] remained in English hands. In four months of raids, Iberville was responsible for the destruction of 36 settlements.

===Early 18th century===
During the 18th century, the British-French struggle in Canada intensified as the rivalry between the mother countries worsened in Europe. As concerns grew, the French government poured more and more military spending into its North American colonies. Expensive garrisons were maintained at distant fur trading posts, the fortifications of Qu<U+00E9>bec were improved and augmented, and a new fortified town was built on the east coast of <U+00CE>le Royale, or [[Cape Breton Island]]<U+2014>the fortress of [[Fortress Louisbourg|Louisbourg]], the so-called "[[Dunkirk, France|Dunkirk]] of the North."

Three times during the 18th century, the French and English North American colonies found themselves at war with one another, in what the British colonists referred to as the [[French and Indian Wars]]. These were in local off-shoots of larger European conflicts<U+2014>the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1702<U+2013>13), the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1744<U+2013>48), and the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756<U+2013>63). Each witnessed attacks by the English colonists on French areas of settlement, while the petite guerre of the Canadiens left a trail of terror and devastation through the northern towns and villages of [[New England]], sometimes reaching as far south as [[Virginia]].{{ref|Virginia}} In 1713, a British force managed to capture [[Port Royal, Nova Scotia|Port Royal]], the French capital of [[Acadia]] in present-day [[Nova Scotia]]. As a result, France was forced to cede control of mainland Nova Scotia to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]], leaving present-day [[New Brunswick]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and Cape Breton Island in the hands of the French.

During the War of the Austrian Succession, a force of New England militia, under [[William Pepperrell|William Pepperell]] and Commodore [[Peter Warren (admiral)|Peter Warren]] of the [[Royal Navy]], succeeded in capturing Louisbourg in 1745. Yet by the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] that ended the war in 1748, France got Louisbourg back by trading off other of its conquests in the [[Netherlands]] and [[India]]. The New Englanders were outraged, and as a counterweight to the continuing French strength at Louisbourg, the British founded the military settlement of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] in 1749, with a strong naval base in its spacious harbour.<!--Please focus the reader on the important links; I've delinked the peppering of low-value simple years that was making it hard to read.

===Seven Years' War===
{{Main|Seven Years' War}}
In 1754, the Seven Years' War began in North America, where it is sometimes called the [[French and Indian War]]. The French had begun to challenge the claims of Anglo-American [[fur trade|traders]] and [[Ohio Company|land speculators]] for supremacy in the [[Ohio Country]] to the west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]<U+2014>land that was claimed by some of the British colonies in their royal charters. In 1753, the French started the military occupation of the Ohio Country by building a series of forts. In 1755, the British sent two regiments of the line to North America to drive the French from these forts, but these were [[Braddock Expedition|destroyed]] by French Canadians and American Indians as they approached [[Fort Duquesne]]. War was formally declared in 1756, and in Quebec, six French regiments of [[troupes de terre]], or line infantry, came under the command of the newly arrived general, the 44-year-old [[Marquis de Montcalm]]. Accompanying him were another two battalions of 'troupes de terre', bringing the total number of French professional soldiers in the colony to about 4000. This was the first significant aggregation of trained professional soldiers on what was to be Canadian soil.
[[Image:Death-wolfe.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'', painted by [[Benjamin West]], [[apocrypha]]lly depicts [[James Wolfe|General Wolfe]]'s final moments during the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] in 1759.]]
Under their new commander, the French at first achieved a number of startling victories over the British, first at [[Battle of Fort William Henry|Fort William Henry]] to the south of Lake Champlain, where, in 1757, over 2400 men, mostly British regulars, surrendered. In the following year, an even greater victory followed when the British army<U+2014>numbering about 15,000 under Major General [[James Abercrombie (general)|James Abercrombie]]<U+2014>was roundly defeated in its attack on a French fortification at [[Battle of Carillon|Carillon]] (later renamed [[Fort Ticonderoga]] by the British) at the southern tip of Lake Champlain. The French numbered no more than 3500, but before the British withdrew, the French had inflicted a loss of about 2000 men, mostly regulars, for a total French loss of about 350.  In the meantime, the British war effort had been galvanized by the appointment of [[William Pitt]] as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], who was determined to win battles, and who decided that North America would be the crux of the British war effort. In June 1758, a British force of 13,000 regulars under Major General [[Geoffrey Amherst]], with [[James Wolfe]] as one of his brigadiers, landed and permanently captured the Fortress of Louisbourg.

An even greater victory occurred a year later when, at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]], a British force under Wolfe defeated the French under Montcalm, and took Quebec City.  However, in the spring of 1760, the French General, [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Gaston de L<U+00E9>vis]], marched back to Quebec from Montreal and defeated the British at [[Battle of St. Foy|Ste. Foy]] in a battle similar to that of the previous year; now the situation was reversed, with the French laying siege to the Quebec fortifications behind which the British retreated. However, the French finally had to concede the loss of New France when the Royal Navy rather than the French fleet sailed up the St Lawrence after the breakup of the winter ice. France lost almost all of its North American possessions, and retained only the small islands of [[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon]] as a base for its fishing fleet, which worked the [[Grand Banks]].  The French formally withdrew from much of North America in 1763 when they signed the Treaty of Paris. France was given the choice of keeping either New France or its Caribbean island colony [[Guadeloupe]], and chose the latter to retain one of its sources of sugar (important at that time for the [[rum]] trade).

==Conflicts with the United States==
With the French threat eliminated, Britain's eastern seaboard colonies became increasingly restive. The [[American Revolution]] largely arose from their resentment of paying taxes to support a large military establishment, when there was no obvious enemy.  This was augmented by further suspicions of British motives when the Ohio Valley and other western territories previously claimed by France were not annexed to the existing British colonies, who regarded these as just fruits of war, but were reserved for the British Crown. The [[American Revolutionary War]] (1776<U+2013>83) saw the revolutionaries use force to break free from British rule and claim these western lands. Attempts by the revolutionaries to [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|take Qu<U+00E9>bec]] and a number of posts in the Maritime regions during this conflict were repelled by superior British military and naval power. The revolutionaries' failure to achieve success in these areas, and the continuing allegiance to Britain of some colonists, resulted in the split of Britain's North American empire. Many Americans who remained loyal to the crown, known as the [[United Empire Loyalists]], moved north, greatly expanding the English-speaking population. The independent republic of the [[United States]] emerged to the south, while a series of loyal British colonies remained in place along its northern border. The remaining British colonies were collectively referred to as [[British North America]]. 

===War of 1812===
{{Main|War of 1812}}
[[Image:Battle of Queenston Heights.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''James B Dennis's ''The Battle of Queenston Heights'' depicts the ultimately unsuccessful American landing on [[October 13]], [[1812]].]]
After the cessation of hostilities, animosity and suspicion continued between the United States and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. This erupted into a shooting war in 1812, when the Americans declared war on the British. The Americans were irked by British harassment of US ships on the high seas (including impressment of American seamen into the Royal Navy), the occurrence of which was a byproduct of British involvement in the ongoing [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The Americans did not possess a navy capable of challenging the [[Royal Navy]], and so an invasion of Canada was proposed as the only feasible means of attacking the British Empire. Americans on the western frontier also hoped an invasion would bring an end to what they saw as British support of [[North American Indians|American Indian]] resistance to the westward expansion of the United States, and finalize their claim to the western territories. The early strategy was to temporarily seize Canada as a means of forcing concessions from the British. However, as the war progressed, outright annexation was more frequently cited as an objective<U+2014>an early expression of what would later be called "[[Manifest Destiny]]". Many Americans hoped the Canadians would welcome the chance to overthrow their British rulers.{{ref|annex}}

The Americans launched an invasion across the northern border in July 1812. The war raged back and forth along the border of [[Upper Canada]], on land as well as on the waters of the [[Great Lakes]]. The British succeeded in capturing [[Detroit]] in July, and in October, a major American thrust across the [[Niagara peninsula|Niagara]] frontier was defeated at the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]] by a combined force of British regular troops and colonial militia under Sir [[Isaac Brock]], who lost his life in the battle. 

1813 was the year of American victories, when they retook Detroit and enjoyed a string of successes along the western end of [[Lake Erie]], culminating in the [[Battle of Moraviantown]] on [[October 5]]th. Further east, the Americans succeeded in capturing and burning York (later [[Toronto]]) and taking [[Fort George at Niagara]], which they held until the end of the year. However, in the same year, two American thrusts against [[Montreal]] were defeated<U+2014>one by a force of British regulars at [[Battle of Crysler's Farm|Crysler's Farm]] to the west of the city on the St Lawrence; the other, by a force of mostly French Canadian militia under the command of [[Charles de Salaberry]], to the south of the city at [[Battle of Chateauguay|Allan's Corners]] on the Chateauguay River. The Iroquois tribes of the [[Upper Canada]], the [[Caughnawagas]] from near Montreal, and western tribes under the [[Shawnee]] chief, [[Tecumseh]], were valued allies of the British throughout the campaign. These First Peoples played an important part in many battles and on many occasions had a psychologically debilitating impact on their enemy.  

In December of 1814, the two opponents signed a peace treaty that restored the borders that had existed before the war. Sir Isaac Brock became a martyred Canadian hero. Although the successful defence of Canada relied heavily on the assistance of British regular troops, the Royal Navy, and American Indian allies, in Canada the war has traditionally been portrayed as a Canadian victory{{ref|1812}}, in part due to the large majority of the troops involved in the battles being either Canadian militia or British regular troops formed in Canada from Canadians[http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/amh/AMH-06.htm].

===British withdrawal===
The fear that the Americans might reactivate their wish to conquer Canada remained a serious concern for at least the next half century, and was the chief reason for the retention of a large British garrison there. From the 1820s to the 1840s, there was extensive construction of fortifications in the colonies, as the British attempted to create strong points around which defending forces might centre in the event of an American invasion; these fortifications include the Citadels at [[Citadel of Quebec|Qu<U+00E9>bec]] and Halifax, and [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]] in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]. The [[Rideau Canal]] was built during these years to allow ships in wartime to travel a more northerly route from Montreal to Kingston. (The customary peacetime route was the St Lawrence River, which constituted the northern edge of the American border, and hence was vulnerable to enemy attack and interference.) 

One of the most important actions by the British forces during this period was the putting down of the [[Rebellions of 1837]]. The [[Upper Canada Rebellion]] was quickly and decisively defeated by the British forces. The [[Lower Canada Rebellion]] was a greater threat to the British, and the rebels were victorious at the [[Battle of Saint-Denis 1837|Battle of St. Denis]] on [[November 23]]. Two days later, the rebels were defeated at the [[Battle of Saint-Charles]], and on [[December 14]], they were finally routed at the [[Battle of Saint-Eustache]].

By the 1850s, fears of an American invasion had begun to diminish, and the British felt able to start reducing the size of their garrison. The [[Canadian-American Reciprocity Treaty|Reciprocity Treaty]], negotiated between Canada and the United States in 1854, further helped to alleviate concerns. However, tensions picked up again during the [[American Civil War]] (1861<U+2013>65), apparently reaching a peak with the [[Trent Affair]] of late 1861 and early 1862. This was touched off when the captain of a US gunboat stopped the [[RMS Trent|Royal Mail Steamship ''Trent'']] and removed two [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] officials who were bound for Britain. The British government was outraged and, with war appearing imminent, took steps to reinforce its British North American garrison, which was increased from a strength of 4000 to 18,000. In the end, cooler heads prevailed, war was averted, and the sense of crisis subsided. This incident proved to be the final major episode of Anglo-American military confrontation in North America, as both sides increasingly became persuaded of the benefits of amicable relations. At the same time, many Canadians went south to fight in the Civil War, with most joining the Union army, although some Canadian were sympathetic towards the Confederacy (see [[Canada and the American Civil War]]).

In the meantime, Britain was becoming concerned with military threats closer to home, and disgruntled at paying to maintain a garrison in colonies that were becoming increasingly self-assertive, and that, after 1867, were united in the self-governing Dominion of Canada. Consequently, in 1871, the troops of the British garrison were withdrawn from Canada completely, save for Halifax and Esquimalt, where British garrisons remained in place purely for reasons of [[British Empire|imperial]] strategy.

===Fenian raids===
{{Main|Fenian raids}}
It was during this period of re-examination of the British military presence in Canada and its ultimate withdrawal that the last invasion of Canada occurred. It was not carried out by any official US government force, but by an organization called the [[Fenians]]. This was a group of [[Irish-American]]s, mostly [[Union Army]] veterans from the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] who believed that by seizing Canada and holding her hostage, concessions could be wrung from the British occupiers of their [[Ireland|Irish homeland]].{{ref|fenpop}} 
The fenians had also, to a large degree, incorrectly estimated that [[Irish Canadians]], who were quite numerous in Canada would support their invasive efforts and rise up, both politically and militarily. 

After the events of the Civil War, anti-British sentiment was high in the United States. Irish-Americans were a large and politically important constituency, particularly in parts of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern States]] and large regiments of Irish Americans had participated in the war. Thus, while deeply concerned about the Fenians, the US government, led by Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]],{{ref|Seward}} generally ignored the Fenian organizing efforts. The Fenians were allowed to openly organize and arm themselves, and were even allowed to recruit in Union Army camps.{{ref|camps}} The Americans were not prepared to risk war with Britain, and intervened when the Fenians threatened to endanger American neutrality.

The Fenians were a serious threat to Canada, being veterans of the [[Union Army]] they were well armed. They made two attacks in 1866: one on [[Campobello Island]] in New Brunswick in April, and another in the Niagara and the St Lawrence Valley regions in July; both attacks failed. In New Brunswick, this failure was due to the presence of a strong force of British regulars and the confiscation of Fenian weapons by the American navy. In Niagara, the defeat was at least partially due to the Fenians' own ineptitude in not following up a victory over the Canadian militia at the [[Battle of Ridgeway]]. Two later attacks along the Qu<U+00E9>bec-Vermont frontier in 1870 and Manitoba in 1871 proved similarly fruitless.

Despite these failures, the raids had some impact on Canadian politicians who were then locked in negotiations leading up to the [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] agreement of 1867. The raids reinforced a sense of military vulnerability, especially because the British were known to be seriously considering the downsizing of their garrison, if not its outright withdrawal. The Confederation debates were to some degree held in an atmosphere of military crisis, and the greater military security that would be gained through the pooling of colonial resources was one of the factors that weighed heavily in Confederation's favour.{{ref|Fenians}}

==Canadian independence==
===Canadian militia===
With Confederation in place and the British garrison gone, Canada assumed full responsibility for its own defence; Britain undertook to send aid in the event of a serious emergency, and the Royal Navy continued to provide oceanic defence. Small professional batteries of artillery were established at Qu<U+00E9>bec and Kingston. In 1883, a third battery of artillery was added, and small professional schools of cavalry and infantry were created. These were intended to provide professional backbone for the much larger force of militia that was to form the bulk of the Canadian defence effort. In theory, every able-bodied man between the ages of 18 and 60 was liable to be conscripted for service, but in practice, the defence of the country rested on the services of volunteers who made up the so-called Active Militia, which in 1869 numbered 31,170 officers and men. During the remaining decades of the century, this force was consolidated, attending summer camps, parading about in colourful uniforms, and occasionally being mustered to serve in times of strikes and other civil emergencies. 

The most important early tests of the militia were the expeditions against the rebel forces of [[Louis Riel]] in the Canadian west. The [[Wolseley Expedition]], containing a mix of British and militia forces, restored order after the [[Red River Rebellion]] with little violence in 1870. A greater test was the [[North-West Rebellion]] in 1885 that saw the largest military effort undertaken on Canadian soil since the end of the War of 1812. The Rebellion saw a series of battles between the [[M<U+00E9>tis]] and their allies against the Militia and [[North West Mounted Police]], from which the government forces emerged victorious.

In 1884, Britain for the first time asked Canada for aid in defending the empire. The mother country asked Canada to send experienced boatmen to the [[Sudan]] to help rescue Major-General [[Charles George Gordon|Charles Gordon]] from the [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdi]] uprising. However, Ottawa was reluctant to do this, and eventually [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Henry Petty-FitzMaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]] recruited a private force of 386 [[Voyageur]]s who were placed under the command of Canadian Militia officers. This force, known as the [[Nile Voyageur]]s, served ably in the Sudan and became the first Canadian force to serve abroad.{{ref|Nile}}

===Boer War===
The defence of the empire was again an issue when Britain found itself hard pressed in the Second Boer War in [[South Africa]]. The British asked for Canadian help in the conflict, and the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]] was adamantly in favour of raising divisions for service in South Africa. [[French-Canadians]] almost universally opposed the war, as did several other groups. This split the [[Liberal Party of Canada|governing Liberal Party]] deeply, as it relied on both pro-imperial Anglo-Canadians and anti-imperial Franco-Canadians for support. Prime Minister [[Wilfrid Laurier]] initially sent 1,000 soldiers of the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]]. Later, other divisions were sent, including the privately raised [[Lord Strathcona's Horse]].

The Canadian forces missed the early period of the war and the great British defeats of [[Black Week]]. The Canadians in South Africa won much acclaim for leading the charge at the Second [[Battle of Paardeberg]], one of the first decisive victories of the war. At the [[Battle of Liliefontein]], three Canadians were awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for protecting the rear of a retreating force. About 7,400 Canadians, including 12 female nurses, served in South Africa.  Of these, 224 died, 252 were wounded, and several were decorated with the Victoria Cross. The war remained deeply unpopular in Quebec, where many people viewed it as crushing a democratic minority group, that, in many ways, was similar to French-Canadians. Canadian forces also participated fully in the [[concentration camp]] programs that led to the deaths of thousands of Boer civilians.{{ref|Boer}}

===Creation of the Canadian navy===
[[Image:HMCS Rainbow.jpg|right|thumb|225px|[[HMCS Rainbow|HMCS ''Rainbow'']] in 1910]]
Soon after the debate over the Second Boer War, a similar one developed over whether or not Canada should have its own navy. Canada had long had a small fishing protection force attached to the [[Department of Marine and Fisheries]], but relied on Britain for maritime protection. Britain was increasingly engaged in an [[arms race]] with [[Germany]], and in 1908, asked the colonies for help with the navy. The Conservative Party of Canada argued that Canada should merely contribute money to the purchase and upkeep of some British [[Royal Navy]] vessels.  Some French-Canadian nationalists felt that no aid should be sent; others advocated an independent Canadian navy that could aid the British in times of need. 

Eventually, Prime Minister Laurier decided to follow this compromise position, and the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] was created in 1910. To appease imperialists, the [[Naval Service Act]] included a provision that in case of emergency, the fleet could be turned over to the British. This provision led to the strenuous opposition to the bill by Quebec nationalist [[Henri Bourassa]]. The bill set a goal of building a navy composed of five [[cruiser]]s and six [[destroyer]]s. The first two ships were the [[HMCS Niobe|''Niobe'']] and [[HMCS Rainbow|''Rainbow'']], somewhat aged and outdated vessels purchased from the British. With the election of the Conservatives in 1911, in part because the Liberals had lost support in Quebec, the navy was starved for funds, but during the [[First World War]], it was greatly expanded and played an important role in both the [[Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]].

==World Wars==
===World War I===
[[Image:New Names Canadian WW1 recruiting poster.jpg|right|thumb|225px|A Canadian WWI [[recruiting poster]]]]
On [[August 4]], [[1914]], Britain entered WWI by declaring war on Germany. The British declaration of war automatically brought Canada into the war, because it was still part of the British Empire. However, the Canadian government had the freedom to determine the country's level of involvement in the war. Canada eventually sent [[List of Canadian divisions in WWI|five divisions]] to fight on the [[Western Front]].

In the later stages of the war, the [[Canadian Corps]] was regarded as among the most effective and respected of the armies on the [[Western Front]], possibly because the Commonwealth armies were healthier and often less fatigued than the larger European armies. Indeed, in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Somme]], the [[Canadian Corps]] developed a reputation as [[shock troops]] which were feared by the [[Germans]]. Given this fact, in 1916 the United Kingdom even made use of specific Canadian help to defend the British colonies of the West Indies from the German navy with many Canadian forces being stationed on the island of [[Saint Lucia]] to help defend from a possible German navy attack.

Without [[conscription]], the Canadian force was limited to those dedicated enough to enlist. The high point of Canadian military achievement came at the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] on [[April 9]], [[1917]], during which Canadian troops captured a fortified German hill that had resisted British and French attacks earlier in the war. Vimy, as well as the success of the Canadian flying aces [[William Barker]] and [[Billy Bishop]], helped to give Canada a new sense of identity. As a result of the war, the Canadian government became more assertive and less deferential to British authority, because many Canadians were dismayed by what they saw as British command failures.

The other major combatants had all introduced conscription to replace the massive casualties they were suffering. Spearheaded by [[Sir Robert Borden]] who wished to maintain the continuity of Canada's contribution to [[WWI]] and with a burgeoning pressure to introduce and enforce conscription, the [[Military Service Act]] was ratified. Although the [[conscription]] was seen as strongly favourable in English Canada, the idea was deeply unpopular in [[Quebec]]. In the end, the conscription policy raised about 120,000 conscript, of whom about 47,000 actually went overseas. Indeed, the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]] did much to highlight the divisions between French and English-speaking [[Canadians]], which still continue to this day.

Despite the rancour, the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]] did not hinder Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]]'s political career, for in the following election of that year, [[Borden]]'s Union government won 153 seats, nearly all from English Canada. However, of [[Quebec]]'s 65 seats, [[Borden]]'s government won only 3. 

By the end of the war, Canada lost over half the number of people as did the United States. For a nation of eight million people, Canada's war effort was widely regarded as remarkable. A total of 619,636 men and women served in the Canadian forces in the First World War, and of these 66,655 were killed and another 172,950 were wounded.

After World War I, several units in the Canadian army were sent to [[Russia]], rather than back home, to aid the [[White Russians]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]. These troops were based in [[Vladivostok]] and saw little combat before they withdrew, along with other foreign forces.

Some important WWI battles which contributed to the development of [[Canada]]'s identity include: [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]], [[Second Battle of Ypres]], [[Battle of the Somme]], [[Battle of Arras]].

The participation of Canadian Forces in the battles is commemorated at eight memorials in France and Belgium. Two of the eight are unique in design: the giant white [[Vimy Memorial]] and the distinctive Brooding Soldier at the [[Saint Julien Memorial]]. The other six follow a standard pattern of granite monuments surrounded by a circular path. They are the  [[Hill 62 Memorial]] and [[Passchendaele Memorial]] in Belgium, and the [[Bourlon Wood Memorial]], [[Courcelette Memorial]], [[Dury Memorial]], and [[Le Quesnel Memorial]] in France. 

Since [[Newfoundland]] was a separate [[Dominion]] during WWI and not part of Canada until 1949, there are separate war memorials to commemorate the actions of the soldiers of Newfoundland in the Great War. The largest are the [[Beaumont Hamel|Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial]] and the [[Newfoundland National War Memorial|National War Memorial]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]].

===Second World War===
{{main|Military history of Canada during World War II}}
[[Image:Canadian_forces_Liri_Valley_May_1944.jpg|right|225px|thumb|Canadian forces in Italy advancing from the [[Gustav Line]] to the [[Hitler Line]]]]
Following the German invasion of Poland on [[September 1]], [[1939]], Canada's Parliament supported the government's decision to declare war on Germany on [[September 10]], about one week after the United Kingdom and France. Canadian airmen played an important role in the [[Battle of Britain]], the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and the Canadian merchant marine played a crucial role in the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1940)]].  A large number of Canadian forces were involved in the failed [[Battle of Hong Kong|defence of Hong Kong]]. Troops of the [[2nd Canadian Infantry Division]] also played a leading role in the disastrous [[Dieppe Raid]] in August 1942. The [[1st Canadian Division]] and tanks of the independent 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade landed on Sicily in July 1943 and after a thirty eight day campaign there, took part in the successful [[Allied invasion of Italy]].  Canadian forces played an important role in the long advance north through Italy, eventually coming under their own corps headquarters after Fifth Canadian Armoured Division joined them on the line in early 1944.

On [[June 6]], [[1944]], the 3rd Canadian Division (supported by tanks of the independent 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade) landed on [[Juno Beach]] in the [[Battle of Normandy]]. Canadian Airborne troops had also landed earlier in the day behind the beaches. Resistance on Juno was fierce, and casualties were high in the assault waves, in particular the first assault waves which sustained a 50 percent casualty rate. By day's end, however, the Canadians had made the deepest penetrations inland of any of the five seaborne invasion forces. The Canadians went on to play an important role in the subsequent fighting in Normandy, with the [[2nd Canadian Infantry Division]] coming ashore in July and the 4th Armoured Division in August.  In the meantime, both a corps headquarters (II Canadian Corps) and eventually an army headquarters - for the first time in Canadian military history - were activated. One of the most important Canadian contributions to the war effort was in the [[Battle of the Scheldt]], where First Canadian Army defeated an entrenched German force at great cost to help open [[Antwerp]] to Allied shipping.

First Canadian Army fought in two more large campaigns; the Rhineland in February and March 1945, clearing a path to the [[Rhine River]] in anticipation of the assault crossing of that obstacle, and the subsequent battles on the far side of the [[Rhine River|Rhine]] in the last weeks of the war.  The I Canadian Corps returned to Northwest Europe from Italy in early 1945, and as part of a reunited First Canadian Army assisted in the liberation of The Netherlands (including the rescue of many Dutch from near-starvation conditions) and the invasion of [[Germany]] itself.

Of a population just over eleven million, more than one and a half million Canadians served in the Second World War. Of these more than 45,000 gave their lives, and another 55,000 were wounded. Countless others shared the suffering and hardship of war. By the end of the war Canada was the fourth strongest military power in the world behind only the USA, the USSR and Britain.

==Multilateralism and peacekeeping==
[[Image:Lesterbpearson.PNG|thumb|200px|[[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Lester B. Pearson]] founded the idea of peacekeeping after the his resolution of the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956.]]
Soon after the end of the Second World War, the [[Cold War]] began. As a founding member of [[NATO]] and a signatory to the [[NORAD]] treaty with the US, Canada committed itself to the alliance against the [[Communist bloc]]. Canadian troops were stationed in Germany throughout the Cold War, and Canada joined with the Americans to erect defences against Soviet attack, such as the [[DEW Line]]. As a [[middle power]], Canadian policy makers realized that Canada could do little militarily on its own, and thus a policy of [[multilateralism]] was adopted whereby Canada would only join military efforts as part of a large coalition. Canada also chose to stay out of several wars, despite the participation of close allies, most notably the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Second Iraq War]], although Canada lent indirect support and Canadians citizens served in foreign armies in both conflicts. The postwar period saw a major reorganization when, in 1968, the three forces were merged into the [[Canadian Forces]]. (See also [[Canada and the Cold War]], [[Canada and the Vietnam War]] and [[Canada and the Iraq War]]).

===Canada in Korea===
After the Second World War, Canada rapidly demobilized. When the [[Korean War]] broke out, Canada needed several months to bring its military forces up to strength, and eventually formed part of [[British Commonwealth Forces Korea]]. Canadian land forces thus missed most of the early back-and-forth campaigns because they did not arrive until 1951, when the attrition phase of the war had largely started. Canadian troops fought as part of the [[1st Commonwealth Division]], and distinguished themselves at the [[Battle of Kapyong]] and in other land engagements. [[HMCS Haida|HMCS ''Haida'']] and other ships of the Royal Canadian Navy were in active service in the Korean conflict.

Canada sent over 25,000 troops to fight in Korea. There were 1,558 Canadian casualties, including 516 dead. Korea has often been described as "The Forgotten War", because for most Canadians it is overshadowed by the Canadian contributions to the two world wars. Canada is a signatory to the original 1953 armistice, but did not keep a garrison in South Korea after 1955.{{ref|korea}}

===Peacekeeping===
Closely related to Canada's commitment to multilateralism has been its strong support for [[peacekeeping]] efforts. Canadian [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Lester B. Pearson]] is considered to be the father of modern United Nations Peacekeeping, and Canada has a long history of participation in these missions. Canada participated in every UN peacekeeping effort from when they began until 1989, and has since then continued to play a major role.{{ref|peacekeeping}} More than 125,000 Canadians have served in some 50 UN peacekeeping missions since 1949, with 116 deaths.  As of 2005 however, Canada ranked 33rd on the list of peacekeepers in the world, committing only 300 troops, having greatly declined since 1995.[http://www.polarisinstitute.org/pubs/neverenough.pdf]

The first Canadian peacekeeping mission, even before the creation of the formal UN system, was a 1948 mission to [[Kashmir]]. Other important missions include the long stay in [[Cyprus]], observation missions in the [[Sinai]] and [[Golan Heights]], and the [[NATO]] mission in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]. The 1993 Canadian response to [[Operation Medak pocket]] in Bosnia was the largest battle fought by Canadian forces since the Korean War.{{ref|medak}} One of the darkest moments in recent Canadian military history occurred during the humanitarian mission to [[Somalia]] in 1993, when Canadian soldiers beat a Somali teenager to death, leading to the [[Somalia Affair]]. Following an inquiry, the elite [[The Canadian Airborne Regiment|Canadian Airborne Regiment]] was disbanded and the reputation of the Canadian Forces suffered within Canada.

===Gulf War and Kosovo===
[[Image:canadian_soldiers_afghanistan.jpg|thumb|300px|Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan]]
The 1991 [[Gulf War]] was a conflict between Iraq and a coalition force of 34 nations, led by the US. The result was a decisive victory of the coalition forces. Canada was one of the first nations to agree to condemn Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, and promptly agreed to join the US-led coalition. In August, [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Brian Mulroney]] sent the destroyers [[HMCS Terra Nova|HMCS ''Terra Nova'']] and [[HMCS Athabaskan|HMCS ''Athabaskan'']] to enforce the trade blockade against Iraq. The supply ship [[HMCS Protecteur|HMCS ''Protecteur'']] was sent to aid the gathering coalition forces. When the UN authorized full use of force in the operation, Canada sent a [[CF18]] squadron with support personnel. The nation sent a field hospital to deal with casualties from the ground war. When the air war began, Canada's planes were integrated into the coalition force and provided air cover and attacked ground targets. This was the first time since the [[Korean War]] that its forces had participated in combat operations. Canada suffered no casualties during the conflict, but since its end, many veterans have complained of suffering from [[Gulf War Syndrome]].

Canada participated as a member of NATO in the [[Kosovo War]].

===International Campaign against Terrorism===

Canada joined a US-led coalition in the [[2001 Attack on Afghanistan]]. The war was a response to the [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks]], with the goal to defeat the [[Taliban]] government and rout [[Al-Qaeda]]. Canada sent [[Canadian special forces|special forces]] and ground troops to the conflict. In this war, a Canadian [[sniper]] set the world record for longest distance kill. After the war, Canada formed an important part of the NATO-led stabilization force, [[ISAF]]. Fifteen Canadian soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan; seven due to hostile action, four in armored vehicle accidents, and four in [[Afghanistan friendly fire incident|a friendly fire incident]] when an American plane bombed a group of Canadian soldiers on an exercise near [[Khandahar]]. In November of 2005, Canadian military participation shifted from ISAF in [[Kabul]] to [[Operation Archer]], a part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] in and around Khandahar.

In 2003, Canada refused to take part in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] unless it was approved by the [[United Nations]]. This decision, popular in most of Canada, upset the administration of American president [[George W. Bush]].  Canada continues to have warships in Gulf area as part of [[Operation Apollo]]. Their presence is justified by Canada's commitment to NATO and UN resolutions.
