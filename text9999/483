==History==
Ronald Cuthbert Hay was born on 4 October 1916, at [[Perth, Scotland]]. He was one of five children (three girls and two boys) of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] Cuthbert Joseph Hay and Letitia Griffith Fausset.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=24 October 2010|publisher=The Peerage|title=Captain Cuthbert Joseph Hay|url=http://thepeerage.com/p3706.htm}}</ref> He was educated at [[Ampleforth College]] in [[Yorkshire]].<ref name=tele>{{cite web|accessdate=24 October 2010|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|title=Obituary, Cdr Ronnie Hay|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1366169/Cdr-Ronnie-Hay.html}}</ref>

==Second World War==
Ronald Cuthbert Hay, volunteered for the [[Royal Marine]]s in 1935, and served a year at sea in the [[cruiser]] {{HMS|Devonshire|39|6}}. He then volunteered for flying duties with the [[Fleet Air Arm]] and was posted to the recently reformed [[801 Naval Air Squadron]]. The squadron assigned to the [[fleet carrier]] {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} was equipped with the two seater [[Blackburn Skua]] and [[Blackburn Roc]] fighter aircraft.<ref name=th112/> His first victory during operations over Norway was on the 27 April 1940, which he later described in detail;<blockquote>
"We ran into a [[Heinkel He 111]] bomber, Lieutenant Bill Church attacked from astern and the bomber dived to sea level. They exchanged fire, and when Bill pulled upwards to break off the attack, his aircraft was struck in the belly and crashed into the sea without any survivors. I had  learned my first lesson in air fighting with a vengeance-never break away upwards. I therefore sat on the tail of the bomber and fired short bursts until it crashed into the sea."<ref name=th112>Thomas (2007), pp.10<U+2013>12.</ref></blockquote>
On 31 May Hays squadron joined [[806 Naval Air Squadron]] at [[Detling]] in [[Kent]] to cover the evacuation of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] from the beaches at [[Dunkirk]]. They mainly used the Skua in its [[dive bomber]] role, which was no match for the German [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s.<ref>Thomas (2007), p.17.</ref>  After one mission Hay's plane was only one of four   that returned the rest having been shot down. The squadron remained in Kent until 27 June when the survivors  were sent back to their home base.<ref>Thomas (2007), p.18.</ref> Hay was next transferred to the [[Fairey Fulmar]] equipped [[808 Naval Air Squadron]] which was based at [[Wick, West Sussex]]. The squadron was one of only two Fleet Air Arm fighter squadrons that fought in the [[Battle of Britain]] under [[RAF Fighter Command]] control.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=24 October 2010|publisher=[[Royal Air Force]]|title=Squadrons of Fighter Command in the Battle of Britain|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bob1940/squadrons.html}}</ref>
