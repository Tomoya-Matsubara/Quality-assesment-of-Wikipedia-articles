==History==
===Middle Ages===
[[Image:Oriel College Charter.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The 1326 college charter given by [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]. The concluding nine words give the date as 21 January in the nineteenth year of his reign.]]  
On [[24 April]] [[1324]],<ref name="FD">Hibbert's ''The Encyclopedia of Oxford'' p. 291 gives date as April 24, with the wording "de Brome, obtained from King Edward II, licence". [[Jeremy Catto]]'s article about de Brome in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' gives the date as April 20, with similar wording. Rannie's ''Oriel College'' p.4 has "On April 28, 1324, Letters Patent issued by the King giving licence"</ref> the Rector of the [[University Church of St Mary the Virgin|University Church]], [[Adam de Brome]], obtained a licence from [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] to found a "certain college of scholars studying various disciplines in honour of the Virgin" and to endow it to the value of <U+00A3>30 a year.<ref name="TEO">[[Christopher Hibbert|Hibbert, Christopher]], ''The Encyclopedia of Oxford'' London: [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] (1988) pp. 291-295.</ref> De Brome bought two properties in 1324, Tackley's Hall, on the south side of the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]] and Perilous Hall, on the north side of [[Broad Street, Oxford|Broad Street]], and as an investment, he purchased the [[advowson]] of a church in [[Aberford]]. De Brome's foundation was confirmed in a charter of [[21 January]] [[1326]], in which the Crown, represented by the [[Lord Chancellor]], was to exercise the rights of [[Visitor]]; a further charter drawn up in May of that year gave the rights of Visitor to [[Henry Burghersh]], [[Bishop of Lincoln]], Oxford at that time being part of the [[diocese of Lincoln]]. Under Edward's patronage, de Brome diverted the revenue of the University Church to his college, which thereafter was responsible for appointing the vicar and providing four chaplains to celebrate the daily services in the church.<ref name="OCR"/> The college lost no time in seeking royal favour again after Edward II's deposition, and [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] confirmed his father's favour in February 1327, but the amended statutes remained in force with the Bishop of Lincoln as Visitor.<ref name="OCL">Varley, F.J., ''The Oriel College Lawsuit, 1724-26'' [http://www.oahs.org.uk/oxo/vol%206/Varley.doc Oxfordshire Architectural and Historical Society, Oxford] ([[DOC (computing)|DOC]]).</ref> In 1329, the college received through royal grant a large house known as La Oriole, standing on the site of what is now First quad;<ref name="TI">Pantin, W.A., ''Tackley's Inn'' [http://www.oahs.org.uk/oxo/vol%207/Pantin.doc Oxfordshire Architectural and Historical Society, Oxford] ([[DOC (computing)|DOC]]).</ref> it is from this property that the college acquired its common name, "Oriel", the name being in use from about 1349. The word referred to an ''oratoriolum'', or [[oriel window]], forming a feature of the earlier property.<ref name="TEO" />

In the early [[1410s]] several Fellows of Oriel took part in the disturbances accompanying [[Thomas Arundel|Archbishop Arundel]]'s attempt to stamp out [[Lollardy]] in the University; the Lollard belief that religious power and authority came through [[piety]] and not through the hierarchy of the Church particularly inflamed passions in Oxford, where its proponent, [[John Wycliffe]], had been head of [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]]. Disregarding the Provost's authority, Oriel Fellows fought bloody battles with other scholars, killed one of the [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]]'s servants when they attacked his house, and were prominent among the group that obstructed the Archbishop and ridiculed his censures.<ref name="OUAS"/>

In 1442, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] sanctioned an arrangement whereby the town was to pay the college <U+00A3>25 a year from the fee farm in exchange for decayed property, allegedly worth <U+00A3>30 a year, which the college could not afford to keep in repair. The arrangement was cancelled in 1450.<ref name="MO">Crossley, Alan (editor), 'Medieval Oxford', ''A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 4: The City of Oxford'' (1979) <U+2014> Oxford University Press [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22803 British History Online] ISBN 0-19-722714-7.</ref>

===Early Modern===
[[Image:Oriel_College_1675.jpg|left|300px|thumb|1675 [[engraving|copper engraving]] of the College, looking east across the front entrance and First quad; on the left is the tiered garden where Second quad would be built.]]

In 1643 a general obligation was imposed on Oxford colleges to support the [[Cavalier|Royalist cause]] in the [[First English Civil War|English Civil War]], the King called for Oriel's plate and almost all of it was given, the total weighing 29&nbsp;lb.0&nbsp;oz.5&nbsp;dwt. of gilt, and 52&nbsp;lb.7&nbsp;oz.14&nbsp;dwt. of "white" plate. In the same year the College was assessed at <U+00A3>1 for the weekly sum of <U+00A3>40 charged on the colleges and halls for the fortification of the city.<ref name="OCR"/> When the [[Oxford Parliament (1644)|Oxford Parliament]] was assembled during the Civil War in 1644, Oriel housed the Executive Committee of the [[Privy council]], Parliament being held at neighbouring [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]].<ref name="BCW"/> Following the defeat of the Royalist cause, the University was scrutinised by the Parliamentarians, and five of the eighteen Oriel Fellows were removed. The Visitors, using their own authority, elected Fellows between 1648 and October 1652, when without reference to the Commissioners, John Washbourne was chosen; the autonomy of the College in this respect seems to have been restored.<ref name="OCR"/>

In 1673 James Davenant, a Fellow since 1661, complained to [[William Fuller (bishop)|William Fuller]], then Bishop of Lincoln, about Provost Say's conduct in the election of Thomas Twitty to a Fellowship. Bishop Fuller appointed a commission that included the [[Vice-Chancellor]], [[Peter Mews]], the Dean of Christ Church, [[John Fell (clergyman)|John Fell]], and the Principal of [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose]], Thomas Yates. On [[1 August]] Fell reported to the Bishop that;
<blockquote>When this Devil of buying and selling is once cast out, your Lordship will, I hope, take care that he return not again, lest he bring seven worse than himself into the house after 'tis swept and garnisht.</blockquote>
On [[24 January]] [[1674]], Bishop Fuller issued a decree dealing with the recommendations of the commissioners <U+2014> a majority of all the Fellows should always be insisted on, so the Provost could not push an election in a thin meeting, and Fellows should be admitted immediately after their election. On [[28 January]] Provost Say obtained a recommendation for Twitty's election from the King, but it was withdrawn on [[13 February]], following the Vice-Chancellor's refusal to swear Twitty into the University and the Bishop's protests at Court.<ref name="OCR"/>
 
[[Image:Oriel_College_1733.jpg|right|250px|thumb|1733 copper engraving of the College, looking south, after the completion of Bishop Robinson's and Provost Carter's buildings in Second quad]]
During the early [[1720s]], a constitutional struggle began between the Provost and the Fellows, culminating in a lawsuit. In 1721, Henry Edmunds was elected as a Fellow by 9 votes to 3; his election was rejected by Provost George Carter, and on appeal, by the Visitor, [[Edmund Gibson]], then Bishop of Lincoln. Rejections of candidates by the Provost continued, fuelling discontent amongst the Fellows, until a [[writ of attachment]] against the Bishop of Lincoln was heard between 1724 and 1726. The opposing Fellows, led by Edmunds, appealed to the first set of statutes, claiming the Crown as Visitor, making Gibson's decisions invalid; Provost Carter, supported by Bishop Gibson, appealed to the second set, claiming the Bishop of Lincoln as Visitor. The jury decided for the Fellows, supporting the original charter of Edward II.  <ref name="OCL"/>

In a private printing of 1899 Provost Shadwell lists thirteen [[Gaudy|Gaudies]] observed by the College during the 18th century; by the end of the 19th century all but two, the [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]] and the [[Purification of the Virgin]], had ceased to be celebrated.<ref name="OCR"/>

===Modern===
In the early 19th century, the reforming zeal of Provosts John Eveleigh and [[Edward Copleston]] gained Oriel the reputation of being the most brilliant college of the day and the centre of the "Oxford [[Noetic]]s" <U+2014> clerical liberals such as [[Richard Whately]] and [[Thomas Arnold]] were Fellows,<ref name=NO>''Newman's Oxford - A Guide for Pilgrims'', Ecumenical undertaking between the Vicar of Littlemore and the Fathers of the Oratory at Birmingham <U+2014> Oxonian Rewley Press (c.1978) p.10.</ref> and the during the [[1830s]], two intellectually eminent Fellows of Oriel, [[John Keble]] and [[John Henry Newman]], supported by [[Edward Bouverie Pusey|Canon Pusey]] of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] and others, formed a group known as the [[Oxford Movement]], alternatively as the Tractarians, or familiarly as the Puseyites. The group were disgusted by the [[laziness|indolence]] prevailing in the Church, and they sought to revive the spirit of [[early Christianity]],<ref name="OXM"/> <ref>DeLaura, David, [http://victorianweb.org/books/delaura/1.html 'The Oriel Inheritance'] (chapter one), ''Hebrew and Hellene in Victorian England: Newman, Arnold, and Pater'' (1969) <U+2014> published by [[University of Texas Press]]. Retrieved on [[30 September]] [[2006]].</ref> this caused tension in College as Provost Edward Hawkins was a determined opponent of the Movement.<ref name="NO"/>

[[Image:Oriel_College_1919_Photogravure.jpg|right|250px|thumb|1919 [[photogravure]] of the College, looking south, after the completion of the Rhodes Building (in the foreground)]]
During [[World War I]], a wall was built dividing Third quad from Second quad to accommodate students of [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]], while their college was being used as a military hospital. At this time Oxford separated male and female students as far as possible; [[Vera Brittain]], one of the Somerville students, recalled an amusing occurrence during her time there in her autobiography, ''[[Testament of Youth]]'';
<blockquote>[...] the few remaining undergraduates in the still masculine section of Oriel not unnaturally concluded that it would be a first-rate "rag" to break down the wall which divided them from the carefully guarded young females in St. Mary Hall. Great perturbation filled the souls of the Somerville dons when they came down to breakfast one morning to find that a large gap had suddenly appeared in the protecting masonry, through which had been thrust a hilarious placard:<p> 
"'OO MADE THIS 'ERE 'OLE?"<p> 
"MICE!!!"<p> 
Throughout that day and the following night the Senior [[Common Room (university)#Oxford|Common Room]], from the Principal downwards, took it in turns to sit on guard beside the hole, for fear any unruly spirit should escape through it to the forbidden adventurous males on the other side.<ref>[[Vera Brittain|Brittain, Vera]] ''Testament of Youth: An Autobiographical Study of the Years 1900-1925'' (1933) <U+2014> [[Penguin Books]] Reprint edition (1994) p.136 ISBN 0-14-018844-4.</ref></blockquote>

In 1985, the college became the last all-male college in Oxford to admit women for [[matriculation]] as undergraduates. In 1984, the Senior Common Room voted 23-4 to admit women undergraduates from 1986. The Junior Common Room president believed that "the distinctive character of the college will be undermined".<ref>''Cherwell Retropsective'' (1984 section) ''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|The Cherwell]]'' [[24 November]] [[1989]] edition.</ref>

==Buildings and environs==
===First quadrangle===
[[Image:Oriel_College_First_Quad.jpg|thumb|right|370px|East range of First quad; the ornate [[portico]] in the centre leads into hall, the doors on either side lead to the undercroft (left) and chapel (right).]]
Nothing survives of the original buildings, La Oriole and the smaller St Martin's Hall in the south-east; both were demolished when the [[quadrangle]] was built in the [[Mannerism#Mannerist architecture|artisan mannerist]] style during the 17th century. The south and west ranges and the clock tower were built around 1620 to 1622; the north and east ranges and the chapel buildings date from 1637 to 1642.<ref name="OUAS" /><ref name="OCO" /> The fa<U+00E7>ade of the east range forms a classical E shape comprising the college chapel, hall and [[undercroft]]. The exterior and interior of the ranges are topped by an alternating pattern of decorative [[gable]]s.

====Hall====
In the centre of the East range, the [[portico]] of the hall entrance commemorates its construction during the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] with the legend "REGNANTE CAROLO", ''in the reign of Charles'', in pierced stonework. The portico was completely rebuilt in 1897, and above it are statues of two Kings: Edward II on the left, and probably either Charles I or [[James I of England|James I]], although this is disputed; above those is a statue of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] after whom the College is officially named.<ref name="OCO" />

The hall has a [[hammerbeam roof]]; the louvre in the centre is now [[glazing in architecture|glazed]], but was originally the only means of escape for smoke rising from a fireplace in the centre of the floor. The wooden panelling was designed by [[Ninian Comper]] and was erected in 1911 in place of some previous [[Gothic Revival architecture|19th-century Gothic]] type, though even earlier panelling, dating from 1710, is evident in the Buttery.

Behind the High Table is a portrait of Edward II; underneath is a [[longsword]] brought to the college in 1902 after being preserved for many years on one of the college's estates at [[Swainswick]], near [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. On either side are portraits of [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] and [[Joseph Butler]]. The other portraits around the hall include other prominent members of Oriel such as [[Cecil Rhodes]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Thomas Arnold]], [[James Anthony Froude]], [[John Keble]], [[John Henry Cardinal Newman|John Henry Newman]], [[Richard Whately]] and [[John Robinson (1650-1723)|John Robinson]].

The [[stained glass|heraldic glass]] in the windows display the [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] of benefactors and distinguished members of the College; three of the windows were designed by Ninian Comper.<ref name="OCO" /> The window next to the entrance on the East side contains the arms of [[Regius Professor of Modern History (Oxford)|Regius Professors of Modern History]] who have been ''[[ex-officio]]'' Fellows of the College.<ref name="OUAS" />

====Chapel====
The current chapel is Oriel's third, the first being built around 1373 on the north side of the front quadrangle. By 1566, the chapel was located on the south side of the quadrangle, as shown in a drawing made for [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s visit to Oxford in that year. The present building was consecrated in 1642 and despite subsequent restorations it largely retains its original appearance.

[[Image:Oriel_College_St_Margaret.jpg|right|210px|thumb|In the gallery of the chapel is a late medieval stained glass image of [[Margaret the Virgin|St Margaret of Antioch]].]]
The bronze [[rostrum|lectern]] was given to the College in 1654. The black and white marble paving dates from 1677-78. Except for the [[pew]]s on the west, dating from 1884, the panelling, stalls and screens are all 17th-century, as are the altar and carved [[altar rails|communion rails]]. Behind the altar is [[Bernard van Orley]]'s ''[[Stations of the Cross|The Carrying of the Cross]]'' <U+2014> a companion-piece to this painting is in the [[National Gallery of Scotland]]. The organ case dates from 1716; originally designed by Christopher Schreider for St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington, it was acquired by Oriel in 1884.<ref name="TOO">Pacey, Robert and Popkin, Michael, ''The Organs of Oxford'' (1980) <U+2014> Second edition published by [http://www.positifpress.com/books/ISBN0906894255.html Positif Press, Oxford], p.73 ISBN 0-906894-25-5.</ref>

In the north-west window of the gallery there is a small piece of [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] glass, a figure of [[Saint Margaret the Virgin|St Margaret of Antioch]]. In the south window of the gallery there is a painted window of "[[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|The Presentation of Christ in the Temple]]", executed by William Peckitt of York. It was originally set in the east window in 1767; a later version of his work can be seen in [[New College, Oxford|New College]] Chapel. The rest of the [[stained glass]] is [[Victorian era|Victorian]]: the earliest is on the easternmost part of the south side; the rest date from after the 1884 restorations by Powell.

Above the entrance to the chapel is an oriel that, until the [[1880s]], was a room on the first floor that formed part of a set of rooms that were occupied by [[Richard Whately]], and later by [[John Henry Cardinal Newman|John Newman]]. Whately is said to have used the space as a larder and Newman is said to have used it for his private prayers <U+2014> when the organ was installed in 1884, the space was used for the blower. The wall that once separated the room from the [[ante-chapel]] was removed, making it accessible from the chapel. The organ was built by J. W. Walker & Sons in 1988;<ref name="TOO"/> in 1991 the space behind the organ was rebuilt as an oratory and memorial to Newman and the [[Oxford Movement]]. A new stained glass window designed by Vivienne Haig and realised by Douglas Hogg was completed and installed in 2001.

During the late [[1980s]], the chapel was extensively restored with the assistance of donations from Lady Norma Dalrymple-Champneys. During this work, the chandelier, given in 1885 by Provost Shadwell while still a Fellow, was put back in place, the organ was restored, the painting mounted behind the altar, and the chapel repainted. A list of former chaplains and organ scholars was erected in the ante-chapel.<ref>[http://www.oriel.ox.ac.uk/content/160/history Oriel College Chapel Guide & History] (reference for the section). Retrieved on [[22 March]] [[2007]].</ref>

===Second quadrangle===
Originally a garden, the demand for more accommodation for undergraduates in the early 18th century resulted in two free-standing blocks being built. The first block erected was the Robinson Building on the east side, built in 1720 by [[John Robinson (1650-1723)|Bishop Robinson]] at the suggestion of his wife, as the inscription over the door records. Its twin block, the Carter Building, was erected on the west side in 1729, as a result of a benefaction by Provost Carter. The two buildings stood for nearly a hundred years as detached blocks in the garden, and the architectural elements of the First quad are repeated on them <U+2014> only here the seven gables are all alike. In the early 19th century they were joined up to the Front quad with their present, rather incongruous connecting links. In the link to the Robinson building, two purpose-built rooms have been incorporated - the Champneys Room, designed by Weldon Champneys, the nephew of [[Basil Champneys]], and the Benefactors Room, a panelled room honouring benefactors of the college.

[[Image:Oriel_College_Wyatt_Building.jpg|left|thumb|Designed by [[James Wyatt]] and completed in 1796, this building houses the senior common rooms and library.]]
[[Image:Oriel_College_Senior_Library.jpg|right|thumb|On the first floor of James Wyatt's building, the senior library, looking east]]
The north range houses the library and senior common rooms; designed in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style by [[James Wyatt]], it was built between 1788 and 1796 to accommodate the books bequested by [[Edward Leigh, 5th Baron Leigh|Edward, Baron Leigh]], formerly High Steward of the University and an Orielensis, whose gift had doubled the size of the library.<ref name="OCHL">[http://www.oriel.ox.ac.uk/content/138/history-of-the-library Oriel College History of the Library] Retrieved on [[22 March]] [[2007]].</ref> The two-story building has [[rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] arches on the ground floor and a row of [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns above, dividing the fa<U+00E7>ade into seven bays <U+2014> the ground floor contains the senior common rooms and above is the library.<ref name="OUAS" />

On [[7 March]] [[1949]], a fire spread from the library roof; over 300 printed books and the manuscripts on exhibition were completely destroyed, and over 3,000 books needed repair,<ref name="OCHL" /> though the main structure suffered little damage and restoration took less than a year.<ref name="OUAS"/>

===St Mary Hall and the third quadrangle===
The south, east and west ranges of third quadrangle contain elements of [[St Mary Hall, Oxford|St Mary Hall]], which was incorporated into Oriel in 1902; less than a decade later, the Hall's buildings on the northern side were demolished for the construction of the Rhodes Building. Bedel Hall in the south was formally amalgamated with St Mary Hall in 1505.

In the south range, parts of the medieval buildings survive and are incorporated into staircase ten <U+2014> the straight, steep flight of stairs and timber framed partitions date from a mid-15th century rebuilding of St Mary Hall. The former Chapel, Hall and Buttery of St Mary Hall, built in 1640, form part of the Junior Library and Junior Common Room. Viewed from the third quad, the Chapel, with its [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] windows, can be seen to have been built neatly on top of the Hall, a unique example in Oxford of such a plan.

On the east side of the quad is a simple rustic style timber-frame building; known as the "the Dolls House", it was erected by Principal King in 1743.

In 1826 an ornate range was erected in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, incorporating the old gate of St Mary Hall, on the west side of the quad. The large projecting window on the first floor, at the north end, was once the drawing room of the Principal of Hall. Parts of the street wall incorporated into this range show traces of blocked windows dating from the same period of rebuilding in the 15th century as staircase ten.<ref name="OUAS" />

[[Image:Oriel College Rhodes Building.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Statues of [[Cecil Rhodes]], [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] and [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] on the central bay of the Rhodes Building's High Street fa<U+00E7>ade]]
The Rhodes Building, pictured right, was built in 1911 using money left to the College by former student [[Cecil Rhodes]]. It was designed by [[Basil Champneys]] and stands on the site of the Principal's house, on the High Street. Champney's first proposal for the building included an open [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]] to the High Street, a [[dome]]d central feature and [[baluster|balustraded]] [[parapet]]. The left hand block and much of the centre was to be given up to a new Provost's Lodging, and the five windows on the first floor above the arcade were to light a gallery belonging to the Lodging. The college eventually decided to retain the existing Provost's Lodging and demanded detailing "more in accordance with the style which has become traditional in Oxford". It became the last building of the [[Jacobethan|Jacobean revival style]] in Oxford.<ref>[[Howard Colvin|Colvin, Howard]] ''Unbuilt Oxford'' [http://yalepress.yale.edu/YupBooks/book.asp?isbn=0300031262 Yale University Press] ISBN 0-300-03126-2.</ref> On the side facing the High Street, there is a statue of Rhodes over the main entrance, with [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] and [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] beneath. The inscription reads: "e Larga MUnIfICentIa CaeCILII rhoDes", which, as well as acknowledging Rhodes' munificence, is a [[chronogram]] giving the date of construction, MDCCCLLVIIIIII. The building was not entirely well received; William Sherwood, Mayor of Oxford and Master of [[Magdalen College School, Oxford|Magdalen College School]], wrote:

<blockquote>Oriel [has] broken out into the High, ... destroying a most picturesque group of old houses in so doing, and, to put it gently, hardly compensating us for their removal.<ref>[http://www.headington.org.uk/oxon/high/tour/south/095_101.htm 95<U+2013>101 High Street, Oxford], ''headington.org.uk''.

===Island site and the O'Brien quadrangle===
A [[quadrilateral#Taxonomic classification|convex quadrilateral]] of buildings, bordered by the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]], and the meeting of [[Oriel Street]] and [[King Edward Street]] in [[Oriel Square]]. The site took six hundred years to acquire and although it contains teaching rooms and the Harris Lecture Theatre, it is largely given over to accommodation.

On the High Street, No. 106 and 107 stand on the site of Tackley's Inn; built around 1295,<ref name="OCO" /> it was the first piece of property that Adam de Brome acquired when he began to found the college in 1324.<ref name="TI"/> It comprised a hall and chambers leased to scholars, behind a frontage of five shops, with the scholars above and a cellar of five bays below. The hall, which was open to the roof, was 33&nbsp;feet (10&nbsp;m) long, 20&nbsp;feet (6&nbsp;m) wide, and about 22&nbsp;feet (7&nbsp;m) high; at the east end was a large chamber with another chamber above it. The south wall of the building, which survives, was partly of stone and contains a large two-light early 14th-century window. The cellar below is of the same date and is the best preserved medieval cellar in Oxford; originally entered by stone steps from the street, it has a stone [[vault (architecture)|vault]] divided into four sections by two diagonal ribs, with carved [[corbel]]s.<ref name="MO"/>

The Oriel Street site was acquired between 1329 and 1392.<ref name="MO"/> No. 12, now staircases 19 and 20, is the oldest tenement acquired by the college; known as Kylyngworth's, it was granted to the college in 1392 by Thomas de Lentwardyn, Fellow and later Provost, having previously been let to William de Daventre, Oriel's fourth Provost, in 1367. A back wing to the property was added around 1600 and further work to the front was conducted in 1724-38.<ref>Pantin, W. A., 'Kylyngworth's', ''The Oriel Record'', Jan 1944, pp. 246-253.</ref> In 1985, funded by a gift from Edgar O'Brien and <U+00A3>10,000 from the [[Pilgrim Trust]], Kylyngworth's was refurbished along with Nos. 10, 9 and 7.

[[Image:Rhodes' portrait bust.JPG|right|thumb|On the first floor of No.6 King Edward Street is a portrait bust of former student and benefactor [[Cecil Rhodes]].]]
King Edward Street was created by the college between 1872 and 1873 when 109 and 110 High Street were demolished. The old shops on each side of the road were pulled down and rebuilt, and to preserve the continuity, the new shops were numbered 108 and 109<U+2013>112. Named after the college's founder, the road was opened in 1873.<ref>[http://www.headington.org.uk/oxon/high/tour/south/kingedward_street.htm King Edward Street], ''headington.org.uk''. Retrieved on [[31 May]] [[2006]].</ref> On the wall of the first floor of No. 6, there is a large metal plaque with a portrait of Cecil Rhodes; underneath is the inscription:

This memorial is erected by Alfred Mosely in recognition of the great services rendered by Cecil Rhodes to his country.<ref>An ABC of notables [http://www.oxfordinscriptions.com/an_abc_of_notables.htm oxfordinscriptions.com].</ref></blockquote>

In the centre of the quad is the Harris Building, formerly [[Oriel Square tennis court|Oriel court]], a [[real tennis]] court where [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] played tennis with his nephew [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] in December 1642 and [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] had his first tennis lesson in 1859.

===Bartlemas===
Bartlemas is a conservation area that incorporates the remaining buildings of a leper hospital founded by [[Henry I of England|Henry I]];<ref name="BHO">Page, William (editor), 'Hospitals: St Bartholomew, Oxford', ''A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 2'' (1907), pp. 157-58 has 1326 to de Brome and 1328 to Oriel <U+2014> published by Oxford University Press [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=40211 British History Online] ISBN 0-7129-1041-7.</ref> it includes the sports grounds for Oriel, [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus]] and [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln]] Colleges, along with landscaping for wildlife and small scale urban development.

In 1326 Provost Adam de Brome was appointed warden of St Bartholomew's;<ref name="BHO"/> a leper hospital in [[Cowley, Oxford|Cowley Marsh]], the hospital was later granted to the college by [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], along with the payments it had been receiving from the fee farm.

==Coat of arms==
[[Image:Oriel_Boss.jpg|left|thumb|In the [[vault (architecture)|vault]] of the main entrance, a [[boss (architecture)|roof boss]] displays the college's [[coat of arms]], the three lions of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] with an engrailed silver border.]]
[[Image:Oriel_College_Feathers.jpg|right|thumb|On the main gate, a painted carving of the [[heraldic badge|badge]] of the [[Prince of Wales]], a symbol often adopted by members of college. The [[German language|German]] [[motto]] "''Ich dien ''" means "I serve."]]
In [[heraldry|heraldic]] terminology: ''Gules, three lions passant guardant or within a bordure engrailed argent''

The arms of the College are based on those of the founder [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], the three gold lions of England on a red background. However, as no one may bear another's arms unaltered, an engrailed silver border was added "for difference".

The [[Prince of Wales's feathers|three feathers]], often adopted by members of the College, can be found in decorations around college and is the motif on the college crested tie. It probably represents [[Edward, the Black Prince#Emblem|Edward, the Black Prince]], although it may represent [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], who was [[Prince of Wales]] when the building of First quad began in the 17th century.<ref>[http://www.oriel.ox.ac.uk/content/147/the-name-and-arms-of-the-college The name and arms of the College] ''Oriel College sub-page''.

==Grace==
Before [[formal (university)|formal Hall]] each evening, the following Latin [[grace (prayer)|grace]] is recited by one of the student bible clerks. The translation is reputedly by [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] in his ''Convivium Religiosum'' of a grace recorded by [[John Chrysostom|St John Chrysostom]]:

<blockquote>''Benedicte Deus, qui pascis nos a juventute nostra et praebes cibum omni carni, reple gaudio et laetitia corda nostra ut nos affatim quod satis est habentes abundemus in omne opus bonum, per Jesum Christum Dominum nostrum, cui, tecum et Spiritu Sancto, sit omnis honos, laus et imperium, in saecula saeculorum.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>Blessed God, who feeds us from our youth and provides food for all flesh, fill our hearts with joy and gladness, that we, having enough to satisfy us, may abound in every good work. Through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with You and the Holy Spirit, be all honour, praise, and power for all ages.</blockquote>

After the meal, the Provost, or a Fellow, usually recites a short Latin prayer [''Benedicto benedicatur, per Jesum Christum'', Let praise be given to/by the Blessed One] instead of the full ''post cibum'' grace:

<blockquote>''Domine Deus, resurrection et vita credentium, qui semper es laudandus cum in viventibus tum in defunctis, agimus tibi gratias pro Eduardo secundo, Fundatore nostro, pro Adamo De Brome, praecipuo benefactore caeterisque benefactoribus nostris, quorum benficiis hic as pietatem et ad studia bonarum literarum alimur; rogantes ut nos his donis tuis recte utentes, ad resurrectionis gloriam immortalem perducamur, per Jesum Christum Dominum nostrum.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>Lord God, the resurrection and life of all who believe in thee, who art always worthy to be praised by both the living and the dead, we give thee thanks for Edward the Second, our Founder, for Adam de Brome, our principal benefactor and for all our other benefactors, by whose benefits we are here maintained in godliness and learning; and we beseech thee that using these thy gifts rightly we may be led to the immortal glory of resurrection, through Jesus Christ our Lord.<ref>Adams, Reginald, ''The College Graces of Oxford and Cambridge'' The Perpetua Press, Oxford (1992) pp. 26-27 and 93 (reference for the section) ISBN 1-870882-06-7.</ref></blockquote>

==Student life==
Accommodation is provided for all undergraduates, and for some graduates, though some accommodation is off-site. Members are generally expected to dine in hall, where there are two sittings every evening, one [[Informal Hall|informal]] and one [[formal (university)|formal]], except on Saturdays, where there is only an informal sitting.<ref name="OCM"/> The Bar, situated underneath the Hall, serves food from mid-morning and drinks in the evening; its LCD TV was installed prior to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 football World Cup]]. There is both a Junior Common Room (JCR), between Second and Third quad, and a Middle Common Room (MCR), on the Island Site.

The college lending library supplements the university libraries; with over 100,000 volumes, it is one of the largest college libraries in the university and will purchase books needed for the course. Most undergraduate tutorials are carried out in the college, though for other specialist papers, undergraduates may be sent to tutors in other colleges.

Since 2001, Oriel College students have chosen not to be affiliated to the University-wide Students' Union, [[Oxford University Student Union|OUSU]],<ref>[http://www.oxfordstudent.com/tt2001wk5/news/oriel_split_with_ousu Oriel Split with OUSU] Buckley, Julia, ''The Oxford Student'' article of [[31 May]] [[2001]] .

Oriel has a reputation for its success in [[sport rowing|rowing]], in particular the two intercollegiate [[bumps race]]s, [[Torpids]] and [[Eights Week]].<ref>[http://www.oxfordstudent.com/tt1999wk6/Sport/oriel_stay_a-head_of_river Oriel stay a-Head of river] ''The Oxford Student'' article of [[30 November]] [[1999]]. Retrieved on [[30 September]] [[2006]].</ref> In 2005 they remained "[[Head of the River]]" in Torpids and rowed over second in Eights Week. In 2006 Oriel claimed the first ever double headship in Torpids, rowing over as Head of the River in both the men's and women's first divisions. However, in Summer Eights, the Men's 1st VIII were awarded spoons after being bumped every day. On the afternoons of the Thursday, Friday and Saturday of 7th week in [[Trinity Term]], the boat club hosts the annual Oriel Regatta; events in this competition include side-by-side racing for eights, coxed fours, pairs and single sculls. The course runs upstream from the Longbridges Boathouse to past the end of boathouses on Christ Church Island and are conducted in knock-out format.

[[Croquet]] may be played in St Mary quad in the summer, as can [[bowls]] on the south lawn of First quad.<ref name="OCM" /> The sports ground is mainly used for [[cricket]], [[tennis]], [[Rugby union|rugby]] and [[football (soccer)|football]]. Rowing is carried out from the boat-house across [[Christ Church Meadow, Oxford|Christ Church Meadow]].

==Silver plate==
Oriel has three notable pieces of medieval [[sterling silver|plate]]. The first is a French beaker and cover in silver gilt; past estimates on its dating from 1460-70 are thought mistaken, and circa 1350, with later decoration, was later expounded.<ref>The more recent date is for example given in the ''[[Victoria County History|Victoria County History of the Counties of England]], Oxfordshire Volume III'' (1954) p.124. In a modern work, such as the ''Oriel College Oxford, A short guide (2006)'', the year is given as 1350.</ref> It was bought in 1493 for <U+00A3>4.18''s''.1''d''., under the mistaken belief that it had belonged to [[Edward II of England|Edward II]].<ref name="OCO" /> In a college inventory of plate dated [[21 December]] [[1596]], it is named as the Founder's Cup.

The second notable piece of plate is a [[mazer (drinking vessel)|mazer]] of maplewood with silver gilt mounts, dating from 1470-85. On the edge of the rim is a row of grouped beads; below is an inscription in black letters:
:''Vir racione vivas non quod petit atra voluptas sic caro casta datur lis lingue suppeditatur''
:Man, in thy draughts let reason be thy guide, and not the craving of perverted lust;
:So honest nourishment will be supplied, and strife of tongue be trampled in the dust
This type of shallow drinking vessel was quite common in the Middle Ages, but the only other mazers in Oxford are three dating from the 15th century, and one standing mazer from 1529-30, all belonging to [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls]]. Thirdly is a coconut cup, one of six in Oxford; the Oriel cup has silver gilt mounts and dates from the first quarter of the 16th century.<ref>Jones, Alfred, ''Catalogue of the plate of Oriel College Oxford'' (1944) <U+2014> Oxford University Press pp.xi-xiii, 1-2, 97.</ref>

Among the later plate are two flagons, two pattens and a [[chalice (cup)|chalice]] which date from 1640-41. The larger pieces of Buttery Plate include the Sanford and Heywood [[Grace Cup|grace cups]], dated 1654-55 and 1669-70, a rosewater ewer gifted in 1669, a punchbowl dating from 1735-36, and the great Wenman tankard presented in 1679, which holds a gallon and is the largest in Oxford. Many of the 17th- and 18th-century tankards were given by commensales and commoners as a form of admission fee.<ref name="OUAS"/>

==Film and fiction==
The buildings of Oriel College were used as a location for [[Hugh Grant]]'s first film, ''[[Privileged]]'' (1982), as well as ''[[Oxford Blues]]'' (1984), ''[[True Blue (film)|True Blue]]'' (1991) and ''The Dinosaur Hunter'' (2000).<ref name="OIM">Leonard, Bill, ''The Oxford of Inspector Morse'' Location Guides, Oxford (2004) pp.100 and 176 ISBN 0-9547671-1-X.</ref> The television crime series ''[[Inspector Morse]]'' used the College in the episodes "Ghost in the Machine", under the name of 'Courtenay College',<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092379/locations Filming Locations for "Inspector Morse"] [[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]].

In ''[[Tom Brown at Oxford]]'' by [[Thomas Hughes]], Oriel's win in the 1842 [[Head of the River Race]], with Oriel bumping Trinity, was re-written as Tom's college, "St Ambrose" taking first place and "Oriel" in second place.<ref name="OCR"/>
