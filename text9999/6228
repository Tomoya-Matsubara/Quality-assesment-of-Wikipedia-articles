'''Francesco Raffaele Nitto''' (January 27, 1886 <U+2013> March 19, 1943), also known as '''Frank "The Enforcer" Nitti''',  was an [[Italian American]] [[gangster]]. One of [[Al Capone]]'s top henchmen, Nitti was in charge of all strong-arm and 'muscle' operations.  Nitti was later the front-man for the [[Chicago Outfit]], the [[organized crime]] syndicate headed by Capone.

==Early life and Prohibition==
Nitti was born in the small town of [[Angri]], [[province of Salerno]], [[Campania]], [[Italy]].<ref name="AfterCapone"/> He was the second child of Luigi and Rosina (Fezza) Nitto<ref name="AfterCapone" /> and a first cousin of Al Capone.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Chicago Outfit |last=Binder |first=John J |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |location= |isbn=0-7385-2326-7 }}</ref> His father died in 1888, when Frank was two years old, and within a year his mother married Francesco Dolendo.<ref name="AfterCapone" />  Although two children were born to the couple, neither survived <U+2014> leaving Francesco and his older sister, Giovannina, the only children.<ref name="AfterCapone" /> Francesco Dolendo emigrated to the United States in July 1890, and the rest of the family followed in June 1893 when Nitti was 7.<ref name="AfterCapone" /> The family settled at 113 Navy Street, [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].<ref name="AfterCapone" /> Little Francesco attended public school and worked odd jobs after school to support the family.<ref name="AfterCapone" /> His 15-year-old sister married a 24-year-old man and his mother gave birth to his half-brother Raphael in 1894, and another child, Gennaro, in 1896.<ref name="AfterCapone" /> He quit school after the seventh grade, and worked as a [[pinsetter]], factory worker, and barber.<ref name="AfterCapone" /> Al Capone's family lived nearby, and Nitti was friends with Capone's older brothers and their criminal gang (the Navy Street Boys).<ref name="AfterCapone" />

A worsening relationship with Dolendo provoked him to leave home when he was 14 in 1900 to work in various local factories.<ref name="AfterCapone" /> Around 1910, at the age of 24, he left Brooklyn.<ref name="AfterCapone" /> The next several years of his life are poorly documented, and little can be ascertained for certain. He may have worked in the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] neighborhood of Brooklyn around 1911.<ref name="AfterCapone" />  He probably moved to Chicago around 1913, working as a barber and making the acquaintance of gangsters Alex Louis Greenberg and [[Dean O'Banion]].<ref name="AfterCapone" /> He married Chicagoan Rosa (Rose) Levitt in [[Dallas, Texas]], on October 18, 1917.<ref name="AfterCapone" /> The couple's movements after their marriage remain uncertain. He is known to have become a partner in the [[Free State of Galveston|Galveston crime syndicate]] run by [[Johnny Jack Nounes|"Johnny" Jack Nounes]].<ref>{{cite book | title=Galveston: a history of the island | author=Cartwright, Gary | year=1998 | publisher=Macmillan | location=New York | page=210 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RFRu8kYThEcC | isbn=0-87565-190-9}}</ref> He is reported to have stolen a large sum of money from Nounes and fellow mobster [[Dutch Voight]], after which Nitti fled to Chicago. By 1918, Nitti had settled there at 914 South Halsted Street.<ref name="AfterCapone" /> Nitti quickly renewed his contacts with Greenberg and O'Banion, becoming a jewel thief, [[Rum-running|liquor smuggler]], and [[fence (criminal)|fence]].<ref name="AfterCapone" /> Through his liquor smuggling activities, Nitti came to the attention of Chicago [[crime boss]] [[Johnny Torrio|Johnny "Papa Johnny" Torrio]] and Torrio's newly-arrived [[soldato|soldier]], Al Capone.<ref name="AfterCapone" />

Under Torrio's successor, Al Capone, Nitti's reputation soared. Nitti ran Capone's liquor smuggling and distribution operation, importing [[whisky]] from [[Canada]] and selling it through a network of [[speakeasy|speakeasies]] around Chicago. Nitti was one of Capone's top lieutenants, trusted for his leadership skills and business acumen. Capone thought so highly of Nitti that when he went to prison in 1929, he named Nitti as a member of a [[triumvirate]] that ran the mob in his place. Nitti was head of operations, with [[Jake Guzik|Jake "Greasy Thumb" Guzik]] as head of administration and [[Tony Accardo|Tony "Joe Batters" Accardo]] as head of enforcement. Despite his nickname ("The Enforcer"), Nitti used Mafia soldiers and others to commit violence rather than do it himself.  In earlier days, Nitti had been one of Capone's trusted personal bodyguards, but as he rose in the organization, Nitti's business instinct dictated that he must personally avoid the "dirty work"<U+2014>that was what the [[Hitman|hitmen]] were paid for{{citation needed|date= March 2010}}.

Frank and Rose Nitti divorced in 1928, and shortly thereafter he married Anna Ronga Nitti (daughter of a mob doctor and former neighbor of the Nittis in the 1920s).<ref name="AfterCapone" /> The couple adopted a son, Joe.<ref>Ewing, Steve and Lundstrom, John B.

==A new king of Chicago==
Frank Nitti took over control of Chicago after Capone was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment in 1932 for income-tax evasion. Capone, knowing that he was going to be out of the scheme of things for the immediate future, knew it was imperative to have someone he could trust holding his position of power in Chicago in his absence. 

Nitti got down to business almost immediately; he summoned those close to Capone to a conference, outlining how things were going to operate in Capone's absence, with him as head. Most of the Outfit's top men were in attendance, including [[Jake Guzik]], [[Murray Humphreys]] and [[Gus Alex]]; these men were not Italian but their loyalty was never in question and they were crucial to the Outfit's success. [[Anthony Accardo]] and [[Paul Ricca]] also attended. At the summit Paul Ricca was promoted to Under-boss; he would be Nitti's second in command when enforcing the Outfit's law on the streets of Chicago. Also promoted that day was [[Tony Accardo]], who had been Capone's bodyguard; he was given the rank of Capo.

The repeal of the extremely unpopular Volsted Act meant that the Outfit had lost its largest source of income. Nitti had to diversify the Outfit's interests into areas that had once been secondary to bootlegging. Nitti spread the Outfit's interests into prostitution, gambling and labor racketeering. He also involved the Outfit in legitimate business enterprises, including taverns all across Chicago and a substantial stake in the slot-machine operations. 

Gambling was to become the lifeblood of the Chicago mafia just as bootlegging had been in the Capone era. Like all Mafia bosses Nitti had to spend most of his time avoiding the law, and a few months into his reign Nitti had to deal with constant pressure from the police. Much of the police pressure on Nitti had been instigated by an old Capone foe, Teddy Newburry.

Anna Nitti died in 1938.<ref name="AfterCapone" /> On November 8, 1939, Capone's former lawyer [[Edward J. O'Hare]] <U+2014> who had co-operated in bringing about Capone's downfall <U+2014> was shot and killed. Nitti married Ursula Sue Granata, O'Hare's [[fianc<U+00E9>e]], who died in 1940.<ref name="Suicide">"Gang Leader Nitti Kills Himself In Chicago After Indictment Here." ''New York Times.'' March 20, 1943.</ref> He married Annette Caravetta on May 14, 1942.<ref name="AfterCapone" />

==Death==
In 1943, many top members of the Chicago Outfit were indicted for [[extortion|extorting]] the [[cinema of the United States|Hollywood film industry]]. Among those prosecuted were Nitti, Phil D'Andrea, [[Louis Campagna|Louis "Little New York" Campagna]], Nick Circella, [[Charles Gioe|Charles "Cherry Nose" Gioe]], Ralph Pierce, Ricca, and [[John Roselli|John "Handsome Johnny" Roselli]]. The Outfit was accused of trying to extort money from some of the largest movie studios, including [[Columbia Pictures]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[RKO Pictures]], and [[20th Century Fox]]. The studios had cooperated with The Outfit to avoid [[labor union|union]] trouble (unrest itself stirred up by the mob). At a meeting of Outfit leaders at Nitti's home, Ricca blamed Nitti for the indictments. Ricca said that since this had been Nitti's scheme and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] informant ([[Willie Bioff]]) one of Nitti's trusted associates, Nitti should go to prison. A severe [[claustrophobia|claustrophobe]] as a result of his first prison term, Nitti dreaded the idea of another prison confinement. It was also rumored that he was suffering from terminal [[cancer]] at this time. For these or possibly other reasons, he ultimately decided to take his own life.<ref>{{cite book|title=101 Things You Didn't Know About the Mafia|last=Mannion|first=James|url=|accessdate=|isbn= 978-1-59337-267-5|page=71}}</ref>

The day before his scheduled [[grand jury]] appearance, Nitti had breakfast with his wife in their home at 712 Selborne Road in [[Riverside, Illinois]]. When his wife left for church, Nitti told her he planned to take a walk, then began to drink heavily. He then loaded a .32 [[caliber]] [[revolver]], put it in his coat pocket, and walked five blocks to a local railroad yard. Two railroad workers spotted Nitti walking on the track of an oncoming train and shouted a warning. They thought the train hit him, but Nitti jumped out of the way in time. Two shots rang out. The workers thought Nitti was shooting at them, then realized he was trying to shoot himself in the head. Two bullets went through Nitti's hat. Nitti sat on the ground against a fence and, with the railroad workers watching from a distance, shot himself in the head. 

Frank Nitti died on an [[Illinois Central]] railroad branch line in [[North Riverside, Illinois]] on March 19, 1943, at the age of 57.<ref name="Suicide" /> Nitti is buried at [[Mount Carmel Cemetery (Hillside, Illinois)|Mount Carmel Cemetery]] in [[Hillside, Illinois]]. Speculation has persisted regarding the interment of a suicide in a Catholic cemetery. Nitti's grave can be found left of the main Roosevelt Road entrance, about fifty feet from the gate. It is marked "Nitto". To the right of the gate is the family plot containing the grave of Al Capone, marked by a six-foot white monument stone. And straight up from the gate can be found the graves of [[Dion O'Banion]] and [[Hymie Weiss]], both [[North Side Gang]] leaders ordered killed by Capone.

==In popular culture==
Frank Nitti has been portrayed numerous times in television and motion pictures:

* by [[Bruce Gordon (actor)|Bruce Gordon]] in many episodes of the original [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[television series]] ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', based on [[Eliot Ness]]' memoirs, which ran from 1959 to 1963.
