'''Neptune''' is the eighth and farthest [[planet]] from the [[Sun]] in our [[Solar System]]. Named for the [[Neptune (mythology)|Roman god of the sea]], it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third-largest by mass. Neptune is 17 times the mass of [[Earth]] and is slightly more massive than its near-twin [[Uranus]], which is 15 Earth masses and not as dense.<ref name=mass/> On average, Neptune orbits the Sun at a distance of 30.1 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]], approximately 30 times the Earth-Sun distance. Its [[astronomical symbol]] is [[File:Neptune symbol.svg|20px|Astronomical symbol for Neptune.]], a stylized version of the god Neptune's [[trident]].

Discovered on September 23, 1846,<ref name="Hamilton" /> Neptune was the first planet found by mathematical prediction rather than by [[empirical observation]]. Unexpected changes in the orbit of [[Uranus]] led [[Alexis Bouvard]] to deduce that its orbit was subject to [[gravitation]]al [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]] by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed by [[Johann Galle]] within a degree of the position predicted by [[Urbain Le Verrier]], and its largest moon, [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 12 [[Moons of Neptune|moons]] were located telescopically until the 20th century. Neptune has been visited by only one spacecraft, ''[[Voyager 2]]'', which flew by the planet on August 25, 1989.

Neptune is similar in composition to [[Uranus]], and both have compositions which differ from those of the larger [[gas giant]]s [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]]. Neptune's atmosphere, while similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in that it is composed primarily of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], along with traces of [[hydrocarbon]]s and possibly [[nitrogen]], contains a higher proportion of "ices" such as water, [[ammonia]] and [[methane]]. Astronomers sometimes categorize Uranus and Neptune as "[[ice giant]]s" in order to emphasize these distinctions.<ref name=atmo/> The interior of Neptune, like that of Uranus, is primarily composed of ices and rock.<ref name=Podolak1995>{{cite journal

In contrast to the relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere is notable for its active and visible weather patterns. At the time of the 1989 ''Voyager 2'' [[planetary flyby|flyby]], for example, the planet's southern hemisphere possessed a [[Great Dark Spot]] comparable to the [[Great Red Spot]] on [[Jupiter]]. These weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100&nbsp;km/h.<ref name="Suomi1991">{{cite journal

==History==
===Discovery===
{{Main|Discovery of Neptune}}
[[Galileo Galilei|Galileo's]] drawings show that he first observed Neptune on December 28, 1612, and again on January 27, 1613. On both occasions, Galileo mistook Neptune for a [[fixed star]] when it appeared very close<U+2014>in [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]]<U+2014>to Jupiter in the [[night sky]];<ref>{{cite book

|title=Parallax: The Race to Measure the Cosmos|year=2001
|publisher=Henry Holt|location=New York, New York
|isbn=0-8050-7133-4}}</ref> hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. During the period of his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was stationary in the sky because it had just turned [[Retrograde and direct motion|retrograde]] that very day. This apparent backward motion is created when the orbit of the Earth takes it past an outer planet. Since Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small [[telescope]].<ref>{{cite book

In 1821, [[Alexis Bouvard]] published astronomical tables of the [[orbit]] of Neptune's neighbor Uranus.<ref>{{cite book
|first=A.|last=Bouvard|year=1821
|title=Tables astronomiques publi<U+00E9>es par le Bureau des Longitudes de France
|publisher=Bachelier|location=Paris}}</ref> Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesize that an unknown body was [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbing]] the orbit through [[gravitation]]al interaction.<ref name=MNRAS7 /> In 1843, [[John Couch Adams]] calculated the orbit of a hypothesized eighth planet that would account for Uranus's motion. He sent his calculations to Sir [[George Biddell Airy|George Airy]], the [[Astronomer Royal]], who asked Adams for a clarification. Adams began to draft a reply but never sent it and did not aggressively pursue work on the Uranus problem.<ref>{{cite web

[[File:Urbain Le Verrier.jpg|thumb|upright|left||[[Urbain Le Verrier]]]]
In 1845<U+2013>46, [[Urbain Le Verrier]], independently of Adams, developed his own calculations but also experienced difficulties in stimulating any enthusiasm in his compatriots. In June, however, upon seeing Le Verrier's first published estimate of the planet's longitude and its similarity to Adams's estimate, Airy persuaded [[Cambridge Observatory]] director [[James Challis]] to search for the planet. Challis vainly scoured the sky throughout August and September.<ref name=MNRAS7>{{cite journal

Meantime, Le Verrier by letter urged [[Berlin Observatory]] astronomer [[Johann Gottfried Galle]] to search with the observatory's [[refractor]]. [[Heinrich Louis d'Arrest|Heinrich d'Arrest]], a student at the observatory, suggested to Galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of the sky in the region of Le Verrier's predicted location with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a [[planet]], as opposed to a fixed star. The very evening of the day of receipt of Le Verrier's letter on September 23, 1846, Neptune was discovered within 1<U+00B0> of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be, and about 12<U+00B0> from Adams' prediction. Challis later realized that he had observed the planet twice in August, failing to identify it owing to his casual approach to the work.<ref name=MNRAS7/><ref>{{cite journal

In the wake of the discovery, there was much nationalistic rivalry between the French and the British over who had priority and deserved credit for the discovery. Eventually an international consensus emerged that both Le Verrier and Adams jointly deserved credit. However, the issue is being re-evaluated by historians with the rediscovery in 1998 of the "Neptune papers" (historical documents from the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]]), which had apparently been stolen by astronomer [[Olin J. Eggen]] and hoarded for nearly three decades, not to be rediscovered (in his possession) until immediately after his death.<ref name="Neptdisc">{{cite web

Since 1966 [[Dennis Rawlins]] has questioned the credibility of Adams's claim to co-discovery.

===Naming===
Shortly after its discovery, Neptune was referred to simply as "the planet exterior to Uranus" or as "Le Verrier's planet". The first suggestion for a name came from Galle, who proposed the name ''[[Janus (mythology)|Janus]]''. In England, Challis put forward the name ''[[Oceanus]]''.<ref>Moore (2000):206</ref>

Claiming the right to name his discovery, Le Verrier quickly proposed the name ''Neptune'' for this new planet, while falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the French [[Bureau des Longitudes]].<ref>Littmann (2004):50</ref> In October, he sought to name the planet ''Le Verrier'', after himself, and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director, [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Arago]]. However, this suggestion met with stiff resistance outside [[France]].<ref>Baum & Sheehan (2003):109<U+2013>110</ref> French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name ''Herschel'' for ''Uranus'', after that planet's discoverer Sir [[William Herschel]], and ''Leverrier'' for the new planet.<ref>{{cite journal

===Status===
From its discovery in 1846 until the subsequent [[discovery of Pluto|discovery]] of [[Pluto]] in 1930, Neptune was the farthest known planet.

===Internal structure===
Neptune's internal structure resembles that of [[Uranus#Internal structure|Uranus]]. Its atmosphere forms about 5 to 10 percent of its mass and extends perhaps 10 to 20 percent of the way towards the core, where it reaches pressures of about 10&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|GPa]]. Increasing concentrations of [[methane]], [[ammonia]] and water are found in the lower regions of the atmosphere.<ref name=hubbard/>

]]
Gradually this darker and hotter region condenses into a superheated liquid [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], where temperatures reach 2,000&nbsp;K to 5,000&nbsp;K. The mantle is equivalent to 10 to 15 Earth masses and is rich in water, ammonia and methane.<ref name=Hamilton/> As is customary in planetary science, this mixture is referred to as [[volatiles|icy]] even though it is a hot, highly dense fluid.

[[File:Neptune clouds.jpg|right|thumb|Bands of high-altitude clouds cast shadows on Neptune's lower cloud deck]]
Models suggest that Neptune's troposphere is banded by clouds of varying compositions depending on altitude. The upper-level clouds occur at pressures below one bar, where the temperature is suitable for methane to condense. For pressures between one and five bars (100 and 500 kPa), clouds of ammonia and [[hydrogen sulfide]] are believed to form. Above a pressure of five bars, the clouds may consist of ammonia, [[ammonium sulfide]], hydrogen sulfide and water. Deeper clouds of water ice should be found at pressures of about {{convert|50|bar|MPa}}, where the temperature reaches 0&nbsp;<U+00B0>C. Underneath, clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide may be found.<ref name=elkins-tanton/>

High-altitude clouds on Neptune have been observed casting shadows on the opaque cloud deck below. There are also high-altitude cloud bands that wrap around the planet at constant latitude. These circumferential bands have widths of 50<U+2013>150&nbsp;km and lie about 50<U+2013>110&nbsp;km above the cloud deck.<ref name=apj125/>

The thermosphere contains traces of [[carbon dioxide]] and water, which may have been deposited from external sources such as [[meteorite]]s and dust.<ref name=elkins-tanton/><ref name=Encrenaz2003/>

===Magnetosphere===
Neptune also resembles Uranus in its [[magnetosphere]], with a [[magnetic field]] strongly tilted relative to its [[rotation]]al axis at 47<U+00B0> and offset at least 0.55&nbsp;radii, or about 13500&nbsp;km from the planet's physical centre. Before ''Voyager 2'''s arrival at Neptune, it was hypothesised that Uranus's tilted magnetosphere was the result of its sideways rotation. However, in comparing the magnetic fields of the two planets, scientists now think the extreme orientation may be characteristic of flows in the planets' interiors. This field may be generated by [[convection|convective]] fluid motions in a thin spherical shell of
[[Electrical conductor|electrically conducting]] liquids (probably a combination of ammonia, methane and water)<ref name=elkins-tanton>Elkins-Tanton (2006):79<U+2013>83.</ref> resulting in a [[dynamo]] action.<ref>{{cite journal

Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong [[quadrupole]] moment that may exceed the [[Magnetic dipole moment|dipole moment]] in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments, and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis.

Neptune's [[bow shock]], where the magnetosphere begins to slow the [[solar wind]], occurs at a distance of 34.9 times the radius of the planet. The [[magnetopause]], where the pressure of the magnetosphere counterbalances the solar wind, lies at a distance of 23<U+2013>26.5 times the radius of Neptune. The tail of the magnetosphere extends out to at least 72 times the radius of Neptune, and very likely much farther.<ref name=science4936/>

Neptune has a [[planetary ring]] system, though one much less substantial than that of [[Rings of Saturn|Saturn]].

Earth-based observations announced in 2005 appeared to show that Neptune's rings are much more unstable than previously thought. Images taken from the [[W. M.

In particular, it seems that the ''Libert<U+00E9>'' arc might disappear in as little as one century.<ref>{{cite web

The relative "hot spot" is due to Neptune's [[axial tilt]], which has exposed the south pole to the [[Sun]] for the last quarter of Neptune's year, or roughly 40 Earth years. As Neptune slowly moves towards the opposite side of the Sun, the south pole will be darkened and the north pole illuminated, causing the methane release to shift to the north pole.<ref>{{cite news

Because of seasonal changes, the cloud bands in the southern hemisphere of Neptune have been observed to increase in size and albedo. This trend was first seen in 1980 and is expected to last until about 2020. The long orbital period of Neptune results in seasons lasting forty years.<ref name=villard>{{cite news

The Scooter is another storm, a white cloud group farther south than the Great Dark Spot. Its nickname is due to the fact that when first detected in the months before the 1989 ''Voyager 2'' encounter it moved faster than the Great Dark Spot.<ref name=burgess2/> Subsequent images revealed even faster clouds. The [[Small Dark Spot]] is a southern cyclonic storm, the second-most-intense storm observed during the 1989 encounter. It initially was completely dark, but as ''Voyager 2'' approached the planet, a bright core developed and can be seen in most of the highest-resolution images.<ref>{{cite web

==Orbit and rotation==
The average distance between Neptune and the Sun is 4.50&nbsp;billion&nbsp;km (about 30.1&nbsp;AU), and it completes an orbit every 164.79&nbsp;years. On July 12, 2011, Neptune will have completed the first full orbit since its discovery in 1846,<ref name="fact2">{{cite web

The elliptical orbit of Neptune is inclined 1.77<U+00B0> compared to the Earth. Because of an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.011, the distance between Neptune and the Sun varies by 101&nbsp;million&nbsp;km between [[perihelion]] and [[aphelion]], the nearest and most distant points of the planet from the Sun along the orbital path, respectively.<ref name=horizons/>

The axial tilt of Neptune is 28.32<U+00B0>,<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref> which is similar to the tilts of Earth (23<U+00B0>) and Mars (25<U+00B0>). As a result, this planet experiences similar seasonal changes. However, the long orbital period of Neptune means that the seasons last for forty Earth years.<ref name=villard/> Its sidereal rotation period (day) is roughly 16.11&nbsp;hours.<ref name="fact2" /> Since its axial tilt is comparable to the Earth's, the variation in the length of its day over the course of its long year is not any more extreme.

Because Neptune is not a solid body, its atmosphere undergoes [[differential rotation]]. The wide equatorial zone rotates with a period of about 18&nbsp;hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12&nbsp;hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System,<ref>{{cite journal

Neptune's orbit has a profound impact on the region directly beyond it, known as the Kuiper belt. The Kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the [[asteroid belt]] but far larger, extending from Neptune's orbit at 30&nbsp;AU out to about 55&nbsp;AU from the Sun.<ref>{{cite web

There do, however, exist orbits within these empty regions where objects can survive for the age of the Solar System. These [[Orbital resonance|resonances]] occur when Neptune's orbital period is a precise fraction of that of the object, such as 1:2, or 3:4.

==Formation and migration==
{{Main|Formation and evolution of the Solar System|Nice model}}

The formation of the ice giants, Neptune and Uranus, has proven difficult to model precisely. Current models suggest that the matter density in the outer regions of the Solar System was too low to account for the formation of such large bodies from the traditionally accepted method of core [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]], and various hypotheses have been advanced to explain their creation. One is that the ice giants were not created by core accretion but from instabilities within the original [[protoplanetary disc]], and later had their atmospheres blasted away by radiation from a nearby massive [[OB star]].<ref>{{cite web

Neptune's second known satellite (by order of discovery), the irregular moon [[Nereid (moon)|Nereid]], has one of the most eccentric orbits of any satellite in the solar system. The eccentricity of 0.7512 gives it an [[apoapsis]] that is seven times its [[periapsis]] distance from Neptune.<ref><math>\begin{smallmatrix}\frac{r_{a}}{r_{p}} = \frac{2}{1-e}-1 = 2/0.2488-1=7.039.\end{smallmatrix}</math></ref>

From the Earth, Neptune goes through apparent [[Retrograde and direct motion|retrograde motion]] every 367&nbsp;days, resulting in a looping motion against the background stars during each [[Opposition (astronomy and astrology)|opposition]]. These loops will carry it close to the 1846 discovery coordinates in April and July 2010 and in October and November 2011.<ref name=Horizons2011/>

Observation of Neptune in the [[radio]] frequency band shows that the planet is a source of both continuous emission and irregular bursts. Both sources are believed to originate from the planet's rotating magnetic field.<ref name=elkins-tanton/> In the [[infrared]] part of the spectrum, Neptune's storms appear bright against the cooler background, allowing the size and shape of these features to be readily tracked.<ref>{{cite journal

[[File:SunsetNeptune.png|thumb|left|Illustration of Voyager 2 passing Neptune in 1989.]]
''[[Voyager 2]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s closest approach to Neptune occurred on August 25, 1989. Since this was the last major planet the spacecraft could visit, it was decided to make a close flyby of the moon Triton, regardless of the consequences to the trajectory, similarly to what was done for ''[[Voyager 1]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s encounter with [[Saturn]] and its moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. The images relayed back to Earth from ''Voyager 2'' became the basis of a 1989 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] all-night program, ''Neptune All Night''.<ref>{{cite web

During the encounter, signals from the spacecraft required 246&nbsp;minutes to reach the Earth. Hence, for the most part, the ''Voyager 2'' mission relied on pre-loaded commands for the Neptune encounter. The spacecraft performed a near-encounter with the moon [[Nereid (moon)|Nereid]] before it came within 4400&nbsp;km of Neptune's atmosphere on August 25, then passed close to the planet's largest moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] later the same day.<ref name=burgess>Burgess (1991):46<U+2013>55.</ref>

The spacecraft verified the existence of a magnetic field surrounding the planet and discovered that the field was offset from the centre and tilted in a manner similar to the field around Uranus. The question of the planet's rotation period was settled using measurements of radio emissions. ''Voyager 2'' also showed that Neptune had a surprisingly active weather system. Six new moons were discovered, and the planet was shown to have more than one ring.<ref name="science4936"/><ref name=burgess/>

In 2003, there was a proposal to [[NASA]]'s "Vision Missions Studies" to implement a "[[Neptune Orbiter|Neptune Orbiter with Probes]]" mission that does ''[[Cassini<U+2013>Huygens|Cassini]]''-level science without fission-based electric power or propulsion. The work is being done in conjunction with [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]] and the [[California Institute of Technology]].<ref>{{cite journal
