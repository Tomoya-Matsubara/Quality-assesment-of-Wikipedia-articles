'''Jayne Mansfield''' (born '''Vera Jayne Palmer'''; April 19, 1933{{ndash}}June 29, 1967) was an [[United States|American]] [[actress]] who worked in [[Hollywood]] and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].<ref name="WVobit">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', July 5, 1967, p. 63.</ref> One of the leading [[blonde]] [[sex symbol]]s of the late-1950s,<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/time100/heroes/profile/monroe01.html "Heroes and Icons: Marilyn Monroe"], ''Time''; Retrieved: September 21, 2007</ref> Mansfield starred in several popular Hollywood films that emphasized her platinum-blonde hair, hourglass figure, and [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]]-revealing costumes. [[20th Century Fox]] signed a six-year contact with Mansfield to replace [[Marilyn Monroe]] as their resident blonde sex symbol. Throughout her career, she was compared by the media to Monroe and the other top sex symbol [[Mamie Van Doren]]. Mansfield had been a ''[[Playboy]]'' [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate of the Month]] and appeared in the magazine several additional times.

While Mansfield's film career was short-lived, she had several [[box office]] successes and won the [[Theatre World Award]], a [[Golden Globe]], and a [[Producers Guild of America|Golden Laurel]]. In 1955, she enjoyed a successful [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] run acting in ''[[Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (play)|Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?]]''. Mansfield is well remembered for her starring roles in the 20th Century Fox comedy films ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'' ([[1956 in film|1956]]) and ''[[Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?]]'' ([[1957 in film|1957]]). Of her rare on-screen dramatic roles, her performance in ''[[The Wayward Bus (film)|The Wayward Bus]]'' (1957) is regarded as the best. She also sang for studio recordings including the album ''[[Shakespeare, Tchaikovsky & Me]]'' and the singles ''Suey'' and ''As The Clouds Drift By'' done together with rock legend [[Jimi Hendrix]]. Mansfield's notable television work included ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' (1959<U+2013>1963) and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' (1957).

As the demand for blonde bombshells declined in the 1960s, Mansfield remained a popular celebrity, continuing to attract large crowds outside the U.S. and in lucrative and successful nightclub tours. Her film career continued with lower budget [[melodrama]]s and comedies, many filmed in the United Kingdom and Europe, including ''[[Heimweh nach St. Pauli]]'' and ''[[L'Amore Primitivo]]''. In the independent film ''[[Promises! Promises!]]'' (1963), she became the first major American actress to have a nude starring role in a Hollywood motion-picture.

In her personal life she was successively married to her childhood lover Paul Mansfield (1950<U+2013>1958), actor-bodybuilder [[Mickey Hargitay]] (1958<U+2013>1963) and film director [[Matt Cimber]] (1964<U+2013>1966). She was the mother of playmate [[Jayne Marie Mansfield]] (born 1950), Mikl<U+00F3>s Jeffrey Palmer Hargitay (born 1958), Zolt<U+00E1>n Anthony Hargitay (born 1960), and actress [[Mariska Magdolna Hargitay]] (born 1964). She died in an automobile accident at age 34.

Jayne Mansfield was the only child of Herbert William and Vera (n<U+00E9>e Jeffrey) Palmer (1903<U+2013>2003). Her birth name was Vera Jayne Palmer. A natural brunette, she was born in [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania]], but spent her early childhood in [[Phillipsburg, New Jersey]].<ref>Staff.

In 1939, when Vera Palmer married Sale Engineer Harry Peers, the family moved to [[Dallas]], [[Texas]].

She studied the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and [[dramatics]] at the [[University of Dallas]], having only attended [[Highland Park High School (University Park, Texas)|Highland Park High School]] until her junior year.<ref>[http://movies.msn.com/celebrities/celebrity-biography/jayne-mansfield/ "Jayne Mansfield:Biography "].

Between a variety of odd jobs, including a stint as a candy vendor at a movie theatre, she attended UCLA during the summer, and then went back to Texas for fall quarter at [[Southern Methodist University]].

While attending the University of Texas, she won several beauty contests, with titles that included "Miss Photoflash", "Miss Magnesium Lamp", and "Miss Fire Prevention Week". The only title she ever turned down was "Miss Roquefort Cheese", because she believed it "just didn't sound right".

==Film career==
===Mid-1950s===
Mansfield's first movie role was as the supporting role of Candy Price in ''[[Female Jungle]]'' (1955), a low-budget drama filmed in just ten days. Mansfield's part was filmed in a few days and she received $150 for her performance (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|150|1955}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). ''Female Jungle'' was released in January 1955 by producer Burt Kaiser. That year [[Paul Wendkos]] offered her the dramatic role of Gladden in ''[[The Burglar]]'' (1957), his film adaptation of [[David Goodis]]' novel. The film was done in [[film noir]] style, and Mansfield appeared alongside [[Dan Duryea]] and [[Martha Vickers]]. ''The Burglar'' was released two years later, when Mansfield's fame was at its peak. She was successful in this straight dramatic role, though most of her subsequent film appearances would be either comedic in nature or capitalize on her sex appeal.

In early 1955, Mansfield was signed by [[Warner Bros.]] to a six month contract after one of its talent scouts discovered her in a production at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]]. Warner wanted Mansfield as their version of [[Marilyn Monroe]] who was widely popular and lucrative for [[20th Century Fox]]. Mansfield was given a [[bit part]] in ''[[Pete Kelly's Blues (movie)|Pete Kelly's Blues]]'' (1955), which starred and was directed by [[Jack Webb]]. She made one more movie with Warner Bros., which gave her another small, but important role as Angel O'Hara, opposite [[Edward G. Robinson]], in ''[[Illegal (1955 film)|Illegal]]'' (1955). The film offered another rare serious performance by Mansfield. After leaving Warner Bros., Mansfield made an uncredited [[cameo appearance]] in ''[[Hell on Frisco Bay]]'' (1955), starring [[Alan Ladd]].

===Late 1950s===

[[File:Jayne Mansfield.jpg|thumb|Jayne Mansfield in ''[[Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?]]'' (1957)]]

In 1955, she enjoyed a successful [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] run acting in ''[[Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (play)|Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?]]''. This wild comedy starred Mansfield as Rita Marlowe, a wild blonde Hollywood actress. The play also starred [[Orson Bean]] and [[Walter Matthau]]. Returning to Hollywood on May 3, 1956, Mansfield signed a six-year contract with [[20th Century Fox]]. Fox wanted Mansfield to replace [[Marilyn Monroe]], their resident blonde sex symbol, and promoted her as "Marilyn Monroe King Sized".<ref>Jocelyn Faris, ''Jayne Mansfield: a bio-bibliography'', p. 5, ABC-CLIO, 1994, ISBN 978-0-313-28544-8</ref> She was then given her first starring role as Jerri Jordan in the film production of [[Frank Tashlin]]'s ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'' (1956).<ref>John Reid, ''Cinemascope Two: 20th Century-fox'', p. 84, Lulu.com, 2005, ISBN 978-1-4116-2248-7</ref> The film, originally titled ''Do-Re-Mi'', featured a high-profile cast of contemporary Rock n Roll and R&B artists including [[Gene Vincent]], [[Eddie Cochran]], [[Fats Domino]], [[The Platters]] and [[Little Richard]].<ref>Bobby Cochran & Susan VanHecke, ''Three steps to heaven: the Eddie Cochran story'', Hal Leonard Corporation, 2003, ISBN 978-0-634-03252-3</ref>

Mansfield then played a dramatic role in ''[[The Wayward Bus (film)|The Wayward Bus]]'' in 1957. In this film, she attempted to move away from her "dumb blonde" image and establish herself as a serious actress. This film was adapted from [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel, and the cast included [[Dan Dailey]] and [[Joan Collins]]. The film enjoyed reasonable success at the [[box office]]. She won a [[Golden Globe]] in 1957 for New Star Of The Year <U+2013> Actress, beating [[Carroll Baker]] and [[Natalie Wood]], for her performance as a "wistful derelict" in ''The Wayward Bus''. It was "generally conceded to have been her best acting", according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', in a fitful career hampered by her flamboyant image, distinctive voice ("a soft-voiced coo punctuated with squeals"), voluptuous figure, and limited acting range.<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60810F73F5C107B93C2AA178DD85F438685F9&scp=1&sq=Jayne%20Mansfield%20Dies%20in%20New%20Orleans%20Car%20Crash "Jayne Mansfield Dies in New Orleans Car Crash"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 30, 1967, p. 33</ref>  Mansfield reprised her role of Rita Marlowe in the 1957 movie version of ''[[Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?]]'', co-starring [[Tony Randall]] and [[Joan Blondell]]. ''The Girl Can't Help It'' and ''Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?'' were popular successes in their day and are considered classics. ''Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?'' is known as Mansfield's "signature film", because she starred in both the play and film version.

Mansfield's fourth starring role in a Hollywood film was in ''[[Kiss Them for Me (film)|Kiss Them for Me]]'' (1957) in which she received prominent billing alongside [[Cary Grant]]. However, in the film itself, she is little more than comedy relief while Grant's character shows a preference for a sleek, demure redhead portrayed by fashion model [[Suzy Parker]]. ''Kiss Them for Me'', one of Mansfield's last starring roles, was a box office disappointment. The movie was described as "vapid" and "ill-advised".<ref>Martha Saxton, ''Jayne Mansfield and the American fifties'', p. 13, Houghton Mifflin, 1975, ISBN 978-0-395-20289-0</ref> It also marked one of the last attempts by 20th Century Fox to publicize her.<ref>David Shipman, ''The great movie stars, the international years'', p. 349, Angus and Robertson, 1980</ref> The continuing publicity around her physical presence failed to sustain her career.<ref>Paul Donnelly, ''Fade to black: a book of movie obituaries'', p. 452, Omnibus, 2003, ISBN 978-0-7119-9512-3</ref> Mansfield was then offered a part opposite [[James Stewart]] and [[Jack Lemmon]] in ''[[Bell, Book and Candle]]'' (1958), but had to turn it down because of her [[pregnancy]]. Afterward, Mansfield got word that her rival [[Kim Novak]] would replace her in the film.

In 1958, Fox gave Mansfield the lead role as Kate opposite [[Kenneth More]] in the western spoof ''[[The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw]]''. Despite being filmed in 1958, ''The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw'', was not released in the United States until 1959. ''The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw'' required Mansfield to sing three songs; she was not a trained singer, so the studio dubbed Mansfield's voice with singer/actress [[Connie Francis]]. When released in the United States, ''The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw'' became her last mainstream film success.

Despite the publicity and her public popularity, good film roles dried up for Mansfield after 1959. She kept busy in a series of low-budget films, mostly made in Europe. Fox tried to cast Mansfield opposite [[Paul Newman]] in his ill-fated first attempt at comedy, ''[[Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys!]]'' (1958), but Mansfield's ''Wayward Bus'' co-star [[Joan Collins]] was selected instead.

In 1959, Fox lent her to appear in two independent gangster thrillers in England: ''[[The Challenge (1960 film)|The Challenge]]'', co-starring [[Anthony Quayle]], and ''[[Too Hot to Handle (1960 film)|Too Hot to Handle]]'', co-starring [[Christopher Lee]]. Both films were low-budgeted, and their American releases were delayed; ''Too Hot to Handle'' was released in the U.S. in 1961 as ''Playgirl After Dark'', while ''The Challenge'' would not be seen by American audiences until 1963, under the title ''It Takes a Thief''.

When she returned to Hollywood in mid-1960, 20th Century-Fox cast her in ''[[It Happened in Athens]]'' (1962). She received first billing above the title, but only appears in a supporting role. ''It Happened in Athens'' starred a handsome newcomer, Trax Colton, a "unknown" whom Fox was trying to mold into a big star. This Olympic Games-based film was shot in Greece, in the fall of 1960, but was not released until June 1962. It was a box-office flop, and Mansfield's 20th Century-Fox contract was dropped.

In 1961, Mansfield signed on to play Lisa Lang in, ''[[The George Raft Story (film)|The George Raft Story]]'', starring [[Ray Danton]] as the actor. She accepted the part mainly for the money, and because the film was going to be filmed in Hollywood, rather in Europe. Soon after the release of ''The George Raft Story'', Mansfield returned to European films to find work. Over the next few years, Mansfield mainly appeared in low-budgeted foreign films, such as ''[[Panic Button (1964 film)|Panic Button]]'', ''[[Heimweh nach St. Pauli]]'', ''[[Einer Frisst den anderen]]'', and, ''[[L'Amore Primitivo]]''.

In 1963, [[Tommy Noonan]] persuaded Mansfield to become the first mainstream American actress to appear nude with a starring role, in the film ''[[Promises! Promises!]]''. Photographs of a naked Mansfield on the set were published in the June 1963 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'', which resulted in obscenity charges being filed against [[Hugh Hefner]] in Chicago municipal court.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicagoist.com/2009/04/10/friday_flashback_hefs_obscenity_bat.php|title=Friday Flashback: Hef's Obscenity Battle|author=Karl Klockars|publisher=Chicagoist.com|date=April 10, 2009|accessdate= January 25, 2011}}</ref> ''Promises! Promises!'' was banned in [[Cleveland]], but enjoyed box office success elsewhere. As a result of the film's success, Mansfield landed on the Top 10 list of Box Office Attractions for that year.<ref name=Faris01>''Jayne Mansfield: A Bio-bibliography by Jocelyn Faris'', p. 10</ref> The autobiographical book, ''Jayne Mansfield's Wild, Wild World'', which she co-authored with her husband at the time, [[Mickey Hargitay]], was published right after ''Promises! Promises!'' and contains 32 pages of black-and-white photographs from the film printed on glossy paper.<ref>Jayne Mansfield; Mickey Hargitay, ''Jayne Mansfield's Wild, Wild World'', Los Angeles: Holloway House, 1963, OCLC 9922763</ref>

In 1966, Mansfield was cast in ''[[Single Room Furnished]]'', directed by her then husband [[Matt Cimber]]. The film required Mansfield to portray three different characters and was Mansfield's first starring dramatic role in several years. It was briefly released in 1966, but was not officially released until 1968, almost a year after her death.

After the filming of, ''Single Room Furnished'' wrapped, Mansfield was cast opposite [[Mamie Van Doren]] and [[Ferlin Husky]] in ''[[The Las Vegas Hillbillys]]'', a low-budget comedy released by [[Woolner Brothers]]. Despite her career setbacks, Mansfield remained a highly visible personality through the early 1960s through her publicity antics and stage performances. In early 1967, Mansfield filmed her last film role: playing a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] role in ''[[A Guide for the Married Man]]'' a comedy starring [[Walter Matthau]], [[Robert Morse]], and [[Inger Stevens]]. Mansfield received seventh billing<ref>Julie Burchill, ''[http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2003/apr/12/weekend.julieburchill Desperately seeking attention]'', April 12, 2003</ref> as "Girl with Harold".

==Career outside film==
===Stage===
Mansfield acted on stage as well as in film. In 1955, she went to New York and appeared in a prominent role in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of [[George Axelrod]]'s [[comedy]] ''[[Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (play)|Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?]]''. [[Brooks Atkinson]] of the ''New York Times'' described the "commendable abandon" of her scantily clad rendition of Rita Marlowe in the play as "a platinum-[[w:pate|pated]] movie siren with the wavy contours of Marilyn Monroe".<ref>Atkinson, Brooks. "Theatre: Axelrod's Second Comedy", ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 14, 1955, p. 22</ref> In October 1957, Mansfield went on a 16-country tour of Europe for 20th Century Fox. She also appeared in stage productions of ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (musical)#The second production|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'' and ''[[Bus Stop (play)|Bus Stop]]'', which were well reviewed and co-starred Hargitay.

Dissatisfied with her film roles, Mansfield and Hargitay headlined at the [[Dunes (hotel and casino)|Dunes]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] in an act called ''The House of Love'', for which the actress earned $35,000 a week (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|35000|1955}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). It proved to be such a hit that she extended her stay, and 20th Century Fox Records subsequently recorded the show for an album called ''Jayne Mansfield Busts Up Las Vegas'', in 1962. With her film career floundering, she still commanded a salary of $8,000<U+2013>25,000 per week for her nightclub act (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|8000|1962|r=-3}}}}<U+2013>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25000|1962|r=-3}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). She traveled all over the world with it. In 1967, the year she died, Mansfield's time was split between nightclub performances and the production of her last film, ''[[A Guide for the Married Man]]'', a high-budget production directed by [[Gene Kelly]].

===Music===
Jayne Mansfield sang in English and German for a number of her films including ''[[The Las Vegas Hillbillys]]'',  ''[[Too Hot to Handle (1960 film)|Too Hot to Handle]]'', ''[[Homesick for St. Pauli]]'' and ''[[Promises! Promises!]]'', though in the film ''[[The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw]]'' her character [[lip sync]]ed to [[Connie Francis]] singing ''In The valley Of Love'', ''Strolling Down The Lane With Billy'', and ''If The San Francisco Hills Could Only Talk''. She also had classical training in piano and violin. She played violin with a six person back-up at [[The Ed Sullivan Show]].<ref>Martha Saxton, ''Jayne Mansfield and The American Fifties'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1975).</ref>

In 1964, Mansfield released a novelty album called ''[[Jayne Mansfield: Shakespeare, Tchaikovsky & Me]]'', in which she recited [[Shakespeare]]'s sonnets and poems by [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]], [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning|Browning]], [[Wordsworth]], and others against a background of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s music. The album cover depicted a [[bouffant]]-coiffed Mansfield with lips pursed and breasts barely covered by a fur stole, posing between busts of Tchaikovsky and Shakespeare.<ref>[http://www.triad.rr.com/dance/content/jayne.html Welcome to Raymondo's Dance-o-rama.] ''triad.rr.com'' Retrieved December 13, 2006.</ref> ''The New York Times'' described the album a reading of "30-odd poems in a husky, urban, baby voice".

===Television===
Mansfield appeared in numerous television programs, including ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' (for which she played the violin), ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'', ''[[Down You Go]]'', ''[[The Match Game]]'' (one rare episode exists with her as a team captain), and ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]'' (in the mid-1960s when the show was the second highest rated in the U.S.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present]]|author=Brooks, Tim and Marsh, Earle|year=2007|publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]|isbn=978-0-345-49773-4}}</ref>). Mansfield's television roles included those in ''[[Burke's Law]]'' and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. On returning from New York to Hollywood in 1957, she made several television appearances, including in several spots as a featured guest star on [[game show]]s, including ''[[Down You Go]]'', ''[[The Match Game]]'', and ''[[What's My Line?]]''. 

Though her acting roles were becoming marginalized, in 1964 Mansfield turned down the role of [[Ginger Grant]] on the up-and-coming [[television]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', claiming that the role, which eventually was given to [[Tina Louise]], epitomized the [[stereotype]] she wished to rid herself of.<ref>Anika Logan, "[http://www.loti.com/jayne_mansfield.htm Jayne Mansfield - The Poor Man's Marilyn Monroe]", Rewind the 50's</ref> In 1962, Mansfield appeared with [[Brian Keith]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Follow the Sun (TV series)|Follow the Sun]]'' [[drama]]tic series in an acclaimed episode entitled "The Dumbest Blonde" in which her character "Scottie" is a beautiful blonde who feels insecure in the high society of her older boyfriend, played by Keith.

Mansfield was married three times, divorced twice, and had five children. Reportedly she also had affairs and sexual encounters with numerous individuals, including Claude Terrail (the owner of the Paris restaurant [[La Tour d'Argent]]),<ref>Raymond Strait, ''Here They Are Jayne Mansfield'', page 198, SP Books, 1992, ISBN 9781561711468</ref> [[Robert F.

=== First marriage ===
On May 6, 1950, Vera Jayne Palmer married Paul Mansfield. At the time of marriage Jayne was 17 and Paul 21. The couple had a public wedding on May 10, 1950 when Jayne was three months pregnant. Her early acting aspirations were temporarily put on hold with the birth of her first child, [[Jayne Marie Mansfield]], on November 8 that year.<ref name=JaynePaul/> Her husband, Paul Mansfield, hoped the birth of their child would discourage her interest in acting. When it did not, he agreed to move to Los Angeles in late 1954 to help further her career.<ref name=CMG/> She juggled motherhood and classes at the University of Texas, then spent a year at [[Camp Gordon]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], while Paul Mansfield served in the [[United States Armed Forces]]. They were divorced on January 8, 1958. Two weeks before her mother's death in 1967, Jayne Marie, then 16, accused her mother's boyfriend at that time, Sam Brody, of beating her.<ref>"Jayne Mansfield Dies in [[New Orleans]] Car Crash", ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 30, 1967, p. 33</ref> The girl's statement to officers of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] the following morning implicated her mother in encouraging the abuse, and days later, a [[juvenile court]] judge awarded temporary custody of Jayne Marie to a [[great-uncle]], W.W. Pigue.<ref>{{Harv|Strait|1992|pp=288<U+2013>289}}</ref>

=== Second marriage ===
[[File:Pink.Palace .gate.jpg|thumb|Gate and partial view of Mansfield's former mansion, the Pink Palace, at 10100 [[Sunset Boulevard]], [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] (''Photographed: 1997'')]]

Mansfield met her second husband [[Mickey Hargitay]], an actor and bodybuilder who had won the [[Universe Championships|Mr. Universe]] competition in 1955, for the first time at ''The [[Mae West]] Show'', at New York City's [[Latin Quarter (nightclub)|Latin Quarter]] nightclub, and told the waiter asking for her order, "I'll have a steak and that tall man on the left."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imbodybuilding.com/articles/mickey-hargitay/|title=Mickey Hargitay(In Memoriam)|work=Ironman Magazine|author=Gene Mozee|date=February 2007|accessdate=April 10, 2011}}</ref> In November 1957, shortly before her marriage to Hargitay, Mansfield bought a 40-room Mediterranean-style mansion formerly owned by [[Rudy Vallee]] at 10100 [[Sunset Boulevard]] in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]]. Mansfield had the house painted pink, with [[cupid]]s surrounded by pink fluorescent lights, pink furs in the bathrooms, a pink heart-shaped bathtub, and a fountain spurting pink champagne, and then dubbed it the ''Pink Palace''. Hargitay, a plumber and carpenter before getting into bodybuilding, built a pink heart-shaped swimming pool. Mansfield decorated the Pink Palace by writing to furniture and building suppliers requesting free samples. She received over $150,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|150000|1957}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) worth of free merchandise while paying only $76,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|76000|1957}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for the mansion itself,<ref>[http://www.jaynemansfield.net/ The Pink Palace]</ref> a large sum nonetheless when the average house cost was under $7,500 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|75000|1957}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) at the time.<ref>[http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/census/historic/values.html Census of Housing], U.S. Census Bureau</ref>

Mansfield and Hargitay married on January 13, 1958 at the [[Wayfarers Chapel]] in [[Rancho Palos Verdes, California]]. The unique glass chapel made public and press viewing of the wedding much easier. Mansfield wore a transparent wedding gown, adding to the occasion's publicity aspect. Mansfield and her husband toured widely for stage shows, where her leopard-spot bikini became a topic of discussion and newspaper coverage.<ref>Staff Correspondent, "The bare facts at last, all those hours at the gym will pay off with spring's slightly skimpy fashions", ''Miami Herald'', p. D1, March 12, 1986</ref><ref>Dorothy Kilgallen, "Jayne's Touring Strawhats in Bikinis", ''The Washington Post'', p. B11, July 22, 1964</ref> During this marriage she had two children, Mikl<U+00F3>s Jeffrey Palmer Hargitay (born December 21, 1958) and Zolt<U+00E1>n Anthony Hargitay (born August 1, 1960). The couple divorced in [[Ciudad Ju<U+00E1>rez|Juarez]], [[Mexico]] in May 1963. After the divorce, Mansfield discovered she was pregnant. Since being an unwed mother would have killed her career, Mansfield and Hargitay announced they were still married. A third child, [[Mariska Hargitay|Mariska Magdolna Hargitay]] (born January 23, 1964), an actress best known for her role as [[Olivia Benson]] in ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', was born after the actual divorce but before California ruled it valid. After the birth of the child, Mansfield sued for the Juarez divorce to be declared legal and won. The divorce was recognized in the United States on August 26, 1964. She had previously filed for divorce on May 4, 1962, but told reporters, "I'm sure we will make it up."<ref>"Miss Mansfield Asks Divorce", ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 4, 1962, p. 25</ref> Their acrimonious divorce had the actress accusing Hargitay of kidnapping one of her children to force a more favorable financial settlement.<ref>{{Harv|Strait|1992|p=224}}</ref>

=== Third marriage ===
Mansfield married [[Matt Cimber]] (''a.k.a.'' Matteo Ottaviano, n<U+00E9> Thomas Vitale Ottaviano) an [[Italian people|Italian]]-born film director on September 24, 1964. The couple separated on July 11, 1965, and filed for divorce on July 20, 1966.<ref>"Jayne Mansfield Asks Divorce", ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 21, 1966, p. 20</ref> Cimber was a director with whom the actress had become involved when he directed her in a widely praised stage production of ''[[Bus Stop (play)|Bus Stop]]'' in [[Yonkers, New York]], which costarred Hargitay. Cimber took over managing her career during their marriage. With him she had one son, Antonio Raphael Ottaviano (''a.k.a.'' Tony Cimber, born October 18, 1965). Work on Mansfield's film, ''[[Single Room Furnished]]'' (in 1966), was suspended as her marriage to Cimber began to collapse in the wake of Mansfield's alcohol abuse, open infidelities, and her claim to Cimber that she had only ever been happy with her former lover, Nelson Sardelli.<ref>David Wallace, Ann Miller; ''Hollywoodland''; St. Martin's Press; 2003</ref>

==Publicity stunts==
Mansfield appeared in about 2,500 newspaper photographs between September 1956 and May 1957, and had about 122,000 lines of newspaper copy written about her during this time.<ref>Tom Pendergast, Sara Pendergast; ''St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture''; p. 260; St. James Press; 2000; ISBN 978-1-55862-401-6</ref> Because of the successful media blitz, Mansfield was a household name. Throughout her career, Mansfield was compared by the media to the reigning sex symbol of the period, [[Marilyn Monroe]].<ref>May Mann, ''Jayne Mansfield: a biography'', p. 112, Abelard-Schuman, 1974, ISBN 978-0-200-72138-7</ref> Of this comparison, she said, "I don't know why you people [the press] like to compare me to Marilyn or that girl, what's her name, [[Kim Novak]]. Cleavage, of course, helped me a lot to get where I am. I don't know how they got there."<ref>{{Harv|Strait|1992|p=??}}</ref> Even with her film roles drying up she was widely considered to be Monroe's primary rival in a crowded field of contenders that included [[Mamie Van Doren]] (whom Mansfield considered her professional nemesis<ref>Alan Betrock, ''Jayne Mansfield vs. Mamie Van Doren: battle of the blondes'', pp. 1-127, Shake Books, 1993, ISBN 978-0-9626833-4-3</ref>), [[Diana Dors]], [[Cleo Moore]], [[Barbara Nichols]], [[Beverly Michaels]], [[Greta Thyssen]], [[Joi Lansing]], and [[Sheree North]].<ref>Tom Lisanti, ''Glamour girls of sixties Hollywood: seventy-five profiles'', pp. 12, 41, 62, 88, 103, 109, 111, 112, 173, 203, 205, 228, 236, McFarland, 2008, ISBN 978-0-7864-3172-4</ref>

[[File:Sophia and jayne.jpg|thumb|[[Sophia Loren]] (left) and Jayne Mansfield (right), at Romanoff's in Beverly Hills<ref>Daphne Merkin, "[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/style/tmagazine/TW1792179.html The Great Divide]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 28, 2005</ref>]]
In April 1957, her bosom was the feature of a notorious publicity stunt intended to deflect attention from [[Sophia Loren]] during a dinner party in the Italian star's honor. Photographs of the encounter were published around the world. The most famous image showed Loren's gaze falling upon the cleavage of the American actress who, sitting between Loren and her dinner companion, [[Clifton Webb]], had leaned over the table, allowing her breasts to spill over her low neckline and exposing one nipple.<ref>Martha Saxton, ''Jayne Mansfield and the American Fifties'', p. 95, Houghton Mifflin, 1975, ISBN 978-0-395-20289-0</ref> The image was one of several taken in the same minutes as the image visible left. A similar incident, resulting in the full exposure of both breasts, occurred during a film festival in [[West Berlin]], when Mansfield was wearing a low-cut dress and her second husband, [[Mickey Hargitay]], picked her up so she could bite a bunch of grapes hanging overhead at a party; the movement caused her breasts to erupt out of the dress. The photograph of that episode was a [[UPI]] sensation, appearing in newspapers and magazines with the word "censored" hiding the actress's exposed bosom.

The world's media were quick to condemn Mansfield's stunts, and one editorial columnist wrote, "We are amused when Miss Mansfield strains to pull in her stomach to fill out her bikini better. But we get angry when career-seeking women, shady ladies, and certain starlets and actresses ... use every opportunity to display their anatomy unasked."<ref name=autogenerated1/> By the late 1950s, Mansfield began to generate a great deal of negative publicity because of her repeated successful attempts to expose her breasts in carefully staged public "[[wardrobe malfunction|accidents]]".

Mansfield's most celebrated physical attributes would fluctuate in size as a result of her pregnancies and breast feeding five children. Her smallest measurement was 40D (102&nbsp;cm) (which she was throughout the 1950s), and largest at 46DD (117&nbsp;cm), when measured by the press in 1967. According to ''Playboy'', her measurement was 40D-21-36 (102-53-91&nbsp;cm) and her height was 5'6" (1.68&nbsp;m). According to her autopsy report, she was 5'8" (1.73&nbsp;m). Her bosom was so much a part of her public persona that talk-show host [[Jack Paar]] once welcomed the actress to ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' by saying, "Here they are, Jayne Mansfield", a line that was written for Paar by [[Dick Cavett]] and became the title of her biography by Raymond Strait.<ref>"Country Boy", [[Time (magazine)|Time]], January 28, 1966</ref> Almost half a century after her death a biographer of [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], the German-born writer on British architecture, noted the improbable coincidence that he and Mansfield had once stayed at the same hotel in [[Bolton]], [[Lancashire]] and that she had "electrified the dining room with her imposing bosom".<ref>Susie Harries (2011) ''Nikolaus Pevsner: The Life''. Reviewing this book for ''Country Life'', [[Jonathan Meades]] wrote that this "begged the question what was Jayne Mansfield doing in Bolton"? (an industrial town in north west England): ''Country Life'', August 17, 2011.</ref>

==Death==
[[File:Grave of Jayne Mansfield 2007.jpg|thumb|Gravestone at Fairview Cemetery, [[Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania]] (''Photographed: 2007'')]]

While in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]], for an engagement at the Gus Stevens Supper Club, Mansfield stayed at the Cabana Courtyard Apartments, which were near the supper club. After an evening engagement on June 28, 1967, Mansfield, her lover Sam Brody, and their driver, Ronnie Harrison, along with the actress's children Mikl<U+00F3>s, Zolt<U+00E1>n, and [[Mariska Hargitay|Mariska]], set out in Stevens' [[Buick Electra|1966 Buick Electra 225]] for [[New Orleans]], where Mansfield was to appear in an early morning television interview. Before leaving Biloxi, the party made a stop at the home of Rupert and Edna O'Neal, a family that lived nearby.  After a late dinner with the O'Neals, during which the last photographs of Mansfield were taken, the party set out for New Orleans.  On June 29 at approximately 2:25&nbsp;a.m., on [[U.S. Route 90 in Louisiana|U.S. Highway 90]] east of the [[Rigolets Bridge]], the car crashed into the rear of a [[semi-trailer truck|tractor-trailer]] that had slowed because of a truck spraying [[insecticide|mosquito fogger]]. The automobile struck the rear of the trailer and went under it. Riding in the front seat, the three adults were killed instantly. The children in the rear survived with minor injuries.<ref>[http://www.walkerpub.com/radio_jaynemansfield.html The night Jayne Mansfield died, June 29, 1967.] ''walkerpub.com'' Retrieved December 13, 2006.</ref>

Rumors that Mansfield was [[decapitated]] are untrue, though she did suffer severe head trauma. This [[urban legend]] was spawned by the appearance in police photographs of a crashed automobile with its top virtually sheared off, and what resembles a blonde-haired head tangled in the car's smashed windshield. It is believed this was either a wig Mansfield was wearing or was her actual hair and scalp.<ref>[http://www.snopes.com/movies/actors/jayne.htm Jayne Mansfield.] ''snopes.com'' (January 3, 2001). Retrieved December 13, 2006.</ref> The death certificate stated the immediate cause of Mansfield's death was a "crushed [[human skull|skull]] with [[Avulsion injury|avulsion]] of [[human skull|cranium]] and brain".<ref>[http://www.findadeath.com/Deceased/m/Mansfield/dc.jpg Findadeath.com] Mansfield death certificate</ref> Following her death, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]] began requiring an [[semi-trailer truck#Underride guard|underride guard]], a strong bar made of steel tubing, to be installed on all tractor-trailers. This bar is also known as a Mansfield bar, and on occasions as a DOT bar.<ref>[http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1679241 Underride Guard on Everything2]; Retrieved November 29, 2007''</ref><ref>''Reauthorization of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration''; p. 39; United States Congressional Committee on Commerce; 1997</ref>

Mansfield's funeral was held on July 3, in [[Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania]]. The ceremony was conducted by a [[Methodism|Methodist]] minister, though Mansfield, who long tried to convert to [[Catholicism]], had become interested in [[Judaism]] at the end of her life  through her relationship with Sam Brody.<ref>{{Harv|Strait|1992|p=11}}</ref> She is interred in Fairview Cemetery, southeast of Pen Argyl. Her gravestone was shaped as a heart and reads "We Live to Love You More Each Day". A memorial [[cenotaph]], showing an incorrect birth year, was erected in the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]], [[Hollywood, California]]. The cenotaph was placed by The Jayne Mansfield Fan Club and has the incorrect birth year because Mansfield herself tended to provide incorrect information about her age.

Shortly after Mansfield's funeral, Mickey Hargitay sued his former wife's estate for more than $275,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|275000|1967|r=2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) to support the children, whom he and his third and last wife, Ellen Siano, would raise. Mansfield's youngest child, Tony, was raised by his father, Matt Cimber, whose divorce from the actress was pending when she was killed. In 1968, wrongful-death lawsuits were filed on behalf of Jayne Marie Mansfield and Matt Cimber, the former for $4.8 million (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|4800000|1957|r=2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) and the latter for $2.7 million (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|2700000|1957|r=2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).<ref>"Jayne Mansfield Suit Filed", ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 23, 1968, p. 22</ref> The ''Pink Palace'' was sold and its subsequent owners have included [[Ringo Starr]], [[Cass Elliot]], and [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]].<ref>[http://www.jaynemansfield.net/ Web Bio] from fansite</ref> In 2002, Humperdinck sold it to developers, and the house was demolished in November of that year. Much of her estate is managed by [[CMG Worldwide]], an [[intellectual property]] management company.<ref>[http://www.cmgww.com/clients.html CMG Worldwide Clients]</ref>

In 1980, ''[[The Jayne Mansfield Story]]'' aired on [[CBS]] starring [[Loni Anderson]] in the title role and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Mickey Hargitay.  It was nominated for three [[Emmy Awards]]. In 1991, British band [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] scored a U.S. top 20 hit-single with "[[Kiss Them for Me (song)|Kiss Them For Me]]", a song which is an ode to Mansfield. Lyrics include the actress' catchword "divoon", referring to her heart-shaped swimming pool and her love of champagne and parties, and to the grisly automobile accident.
