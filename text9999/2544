'''Imad Abbas''' ({{lang-ar|<U+0639><U+0645><U+0627><U+062F> <U+0639><U+0628><U+0627><U+0633>}}) was a senior member of the [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades]], the military wing of Palestinian Islamist movement [[Hamas]], until his death by the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] on October 21, 2004, in [[Gaza City]].<ref>"Hamas promises to avenge murder; leader killed just before Gaza vote", ''[[Calgary Sun]]'', October 23, 2004, p. 27; reprinted [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2004/1023/1097847312812.html here]</ref><ref>"Palestinians vent fury over murder; Settlements bombed after Hamas man dies", ''[[Morning Star (UK newspaper)|Morning Star]]'', October 23, 2004, p. 3</ref>

Abbas joined the ranks of Hamas in 1991, when he was 17 years old. That year, he participated in an attack killing Israeli soldiers near the [[Karni crossing]] on the [[Gaza strip]] border, and so joined Israel's list of wanted members of Hamas. As a fugitive, he worked with one of the leaders of the brigades, [[Imad Aqel]], before successfully escaping to [[Egypt]] in a boat. Abbas was arrested by the Egyptian authorities but soon released, and he spent the next four years travelling in various Arab countries. In 1996, he came back in the Gaza Strip where he joined other militants. At the beginning of the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]], Abbas became the assistant of [[Adnan al-Ghoul]], a leader of the brigades and a bombmaker.

Living in hiding and never appearing in public, Abbas was killed along with al-Ghoul on October 21, 2004, when an Israeli [[AH-64 Apache|Apache]] helicopter fired missiles at the car in which they were travelling.
