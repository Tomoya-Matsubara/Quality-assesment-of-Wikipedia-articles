The '''Arrow''' or '''''Hetz''''' ({{lang-he|<U+05D7><U+05E5>}}, {{IPA-he|x<U+025B>ts|pron}}) is a family of [[anti-ballistic missile]]s designed to fulfill an Israeli requirement for a [[missile defense|theater missile defense system]] that would be more effective against [[ballistic missile]]s than the [[MIM-104 Patriot]] [[surface-to-air missile]]. Jointly funded and produced by [[Israel]] and the [[United States]], development of the system began in 1986 and has continued since,<ref name=global/> drawing some contested criticism.<ref name="inss" /> Undertaken by [[Israel Aerospace Industries]] (IAI) and [[Boeing]], it is overseen by the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Defence's]] "''Homa''" ({{lang-he|<U+05D7><U+05D5><U+05DE><U+05D4>}}, {{IPA-he|xoma|pron}}, "[[Defensive wall|rampart]]") missile defense agency and the U.S. [[Missile Defense Agency]].

==Background==
{{seealso|Arab<U+2013>Israeli conflict}}
The Arrow program was launched in light of the acquisition by [[Arab League|Arab states]] of long ranged [[surface-to-surface missile]]s.<ref name="iafs" /><ref name=dtic /> The United States and Israel signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] to co-fund it on May 6, 1986,<ref name="global" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.policyalmanac.org/world/archive/crs_israeli-us_relations.shtml |author=Clyde R.

{{cquote|I had the honor, during my term of office as Minister of Defense, in the [[National Unity Government#Israel|National Unity Government]], to vote in favor of Israel's participation in the Strategic Defense Initiative... introduced by [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]]...<ref name="tests" />}}
The Israeli [[Administration for the Development of Weapons and the Technological Industry]], part of the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Defense]], runs the Arrow development project under the ''"Homa"'' missile defense agency which binds together Israel's different defense industries. It is also commonly referred to as the IMDO - Israel Missile Defense Organization.

===Funding===
{{seealso|Israel <U+2013> United States military relations}}
The multi-billion dollar development program of the Arrow is undertaken in Israel with the financial support of the United States. When the development program began, the projection for the total cost of its development and manufacture <U+2014> including the initial production of missiles <U+2014> was an estimated $1.6 billion.<ref name="haalong" /> The price of a single Arrow missile was estimated at $3 million.<ref name="haalong" /> Between 1989 and 2007 some $2.4 billion had been reportedly invested in the Arrow program, 50%<U+2013>80%<ref name="a3-80">{{cite web |url=http://defense-update.com/newscast/0808/0709_arrow-3.html |publisher=[http://www.defense-update.com/about.htm Defense Update] |title=Israel Asks U.S. to Support Arrow-3 | accessdate=2009-08-19}}</ref> of which was funded by the [[federal government of the United States]].<ref name="defup">{{cite web | title = Israel's Strategic Defense Programs: Missile defense System's Update | publisher = [http://www.defense-update.com/about.htm Defense Update] | date = 2007-03-01 | accessdate=2009-08-19 | url = http://www.defense-update.com/features/du-2-06/feature-ILmissiledefense.htm}}</ref> Israel contributes approximately $65 million annually.<ref name="haalong">{{cite web | title = An Arrow to the heart | publisher = [[Haaretz]] | author=Amnon Barzilai | accessdate=2009-09-18 | url = http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=230843&contrassID=2&subContrassID=1&sbSubContrassID=0&listSrc=Y}}</ref>

===Criticism===
A criticism of the concept of missile defense for Israel was aired by Dr. [[Reuven Pedatzur]] in a comprehensive study<ref name="peda">{{Cite book |ISBN=9654590050 |publisher= Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies |place=[[Tel Aviv University]] |title=The Arrow Project and Active Defense - Challenges and Questions |id=Paper #42 |first=Reuven |last=Pedatzur |date=1993-10 |accessdate=2009-09-12}}</ref> published in 1993 by the Jaffe Center for Strategic Studies<ref group=n>Forerunner of the [[Institute for National Security Studies]] (INSS).</ref> The arguments made in the study conformed to the opinions of numerous defense officials and analysts, and echoed many of the arguments made by the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] critics in the United States.<ref name="inss">{{cite web |url=http://www.inss.org.il/upload/%28FILE%291216205936.pdf |format=PDF | pages = 67-69, 75-77 |publisher=[[Institute for National Security Studies]] |title=Missile Defense and Israel's Deterrence against a Nuclear Iran |author=Dr. [[Uzi Rubin]] |date=2008 |accessdate=2009-08-25}}</ref> 

Pedatzur argued that it was exceedingly simple to fool an Arrow-type defensive system with simple, cheap, and easily installed countermeasures, which would render the Arrow system ineffective. He doubted Israel's defense industries could rise to the challenge of such a complex system, citing anonymous experts in the IDF who predicted that the system would not be available before 2010. He envisaged enormous costs, some $10 billion,<ref name="haalong" /> that would distort budgeting priorities and divert funds from the vital enhancement of the IDF's warfighting capability, thus forcing a profound revision of Israel's national security doctrine. He further argued that even if effective against missiles with [[conventional warfare|conventional]], [[Chemical warfare|chemical]] or [[Biological warfare|biological]] [[warhead]]s, the Arrow would not be relevant against future threats of missiles with [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] warheads, since it would never be able to supply hermetic defense and the impact of even a single nuclear warhead in Israel's [[Population density|densely populated]] [[urban area]] would be an existential threat to Israel.<ref name="inss" /><ref name=dtic />

At the same time, [[John E. Pike]], who worked then with the [[Federation of American Scientists]], stated that "given technical problems with the systems radar and command system, coupled with its high development cost, the Arrow program may soon fall by the wayside".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pike  | first1 = John | author1-link = John E. Pike | last2 = Bolkcom | first2 = Christopher | title = 3. Air Defense Effectiveness | journal = [http://www.fas.org/spp/aircraft/ Attack Aircraft.

According to Dr. [[Uzi Rubin]], first Director of IMDO, with the passage of time most of the pessimistic predictions have proven to be unfounded. Israel's defense industries overcame the technical challenge, the system's development was completed a full decade ahead of what was predicted, and there are no indications that the expenditures for the Arrow harmed other IDF procurement plans to any degree whatsoever.<ref name="inss" /> Rubin insists that Israel's missile defense is now an established fact and that most of the warnings issued by critics have failed to materialize.<ref name="inss" /> Pedatzur, however, remains unconvinced.<ref name="peda3" /><ref name="peda2">{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1065134.html |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |title=It's possible to live with Iran |author=Dr. [[Reuven Pedatzur]] |date=2009-02-18 |accessdate=2009-08-25}}</ref>

===Arrow 1===
The first launch of the Arrow interceptor took place on August 9, 1990, designed to test the missile's control and guidance systems. The test came to a halt seconds after take off and the missile was intentionally destroyed due to fears it might go off track and hit a settled location. This was caused by the failure of the ground tracking radars to track the missile's [[trajectory]].<ref name=iaft>{{cite web | publisher = [[Israeli Air Force]] | title= Israel Aircraft Industries 'Arrow' ('Hetz') - In action | url = http://www.iaf.org.il/Templates/Aircraft/Aircraft.IN.aspx?lang=EN&lobbyID=69&folderID=87&docfolderID=907&docID=18137&currentPageNumber=6 | accessdate=2009-08-24}}</ref> Test number two took place on March 25, 1991. Designed to check missile components during launch, it was conducted from a ship at sea. Once again a missile malfunction resulted in the abortion of the experiment.<ref name=iaft/> A third test, designed to examine the Arrow's interception capabilities, was conducted on October 31, 1991. The missile was once again launched from a ship at sea, and was once more aborted because of a repeat of previous malfunctions.<ref name=iaft/>

On September 23, 1992, in another test of the missile components during launch, the systems finally operated as planned and the Arrow reached its designated point in the sky, 45 seconds after launch. As planned, the missile was then destroyed. This successful experiment ended the system's preliminary testing phase.<ref name=iaft/> The fifth, sixth, and seventh tests took place on February 28, July 14, and October 14, 1993 respectively. During these, the Arrow managed to pass in close proximity to the target missiles, thereby proving its ability to intercept surface-to-surface missiles.<ref name=iaft/> During test number eight on March 1, 1994, the missile was not launched due to a ground computer failure.<ref name=iaft/> The ninth test launch on June 12, 1994, also known as ATD#1 (Arrow Demonstration Test 1), saw an Arrow 1 successfully intercept a target missile launched from a ship anchored in the middle of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].<ref name=tests>{{cite web | publisher = [http://www.mod.gov.il/pages/homa/index.htm Israel Missile Defense Organization] | title= Story of the Arrow Weapon System | url = http://www.mod.gov.il/pages/homa/bg.htm | accessdate=2009-08-19}}</ref><ref name=iaft/> 

The Arrow 1 was a two stage [[solid propellant]] missile, with an overall length of {{m to ft|7.5|sp=us|abbr=on|precision=1|wiki=no}}, a body diameter of {{mm to in|1200|sp=us|abbr=on|precision=1|wiki=no}}, and a launch weight of around {{kg to lb|2000|sp=us|abbr=on|precision=-2|wiki=no}}.

The missile was described as being relatively high-speed and maneuverable, with [[thrust vectoring]] in the both stages. The range capability has been described as around {{km to mi|50|sp=us|abbr=on|precision=0|wiki=no}}.<ref name=nti2>{{cite web |url=http://nuclearthreatinitiative.org/e_research/profiles/Israel/Missile/3571_5219.html |publisher=[[Nuclear Threat Initiative]] |title=Israel profile: Missile overview: Missile Chronology: 1990-1999 |date=2005-10 |accessdate=2009-09-21}}</ref> On the other hand, the Arrow 1 could be a single stage missile.<ref name="stav" /> Development of the "big and cumbersome"<ref name="uzi" /> Arrow 1 then ceased and further research continued with the "smaller, faster and more lethal" Arrow 2.<ref name=iafs/><ref name=tests/>

The new component will also require the integration of longer range detection, tracking and discrimination capability, beyond what the "Green Pine" and "Super Green Pine" radars employed with the Arrow 2 are providing.

The Arrow system was exclusively designed to intercept medium- and short-range ballistic missiles, with an eye on the advanced missile programs of [[Iran]] and [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Iraq]]. It is not intended to intercept either [[military aircraft]] or [[Rocket artillery|artillery rockets]], the second of which are relatively small and short ranged. In contrast to both [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD]], [[RIM-161 Standard Missile 3]] (exoatmospheric), and [[MIM-104 Patriot#PAC-3|MIM-104 Patriot PAC-3]] (low altitude), the Arrow intercepts its targets in the high [[stratosphere]], high enough so that any nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons do not scatter over Israel.<ref name=mstrt /> The developers' intention was to perform the destruction sequence away from populated locations.<ref name=iafs>{{cite web | publisher = [[Israeli Air Force]] | title= Israel Aircraft Industries 'Arrow' ('Hetz') - Systems | url = http://www.iaf.org.il/Templates/Aircraft/Aircraft.IN.aspx?lang=EN&lobbyID=69&folderID=87&docfolderID=907&docID=18137&currentPageNumber=6 | accessdate=2009-08-24}}</ref> According to Dr. [[Uzi Rubin]], the missile was tested to determine whether chemical warfare agents would reach the ground should such a [[warhead]] be intercepted. The conclusion was that nothing would reach the ground if the warhead is destroyed above the [[jet stream]], which flows from west to east and would therefore blow any chemical residue back to its point of origin.<ref group=n>Most likely - Syria.</ref><ref name="uzi">{{cite web |url=http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp493.htm |publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]] |author=Dr. [[Uzi Rubin]] |title= Beyond Iraq: Missile Proliferation in the Middle East |date=2003-03-02 |accessdate=2009-09-10}}</ref> Nevertheless, Arrow is also capable of low altitude interception, as well as multi<U+2014> tactical ballistic missiles interception.<ref name="iaibr"/>

The "Citron Tree" has three banks of operator consoles laid out in a U shape. In the center sits the [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] in command who oversees the engagement, but also has links to the other parts of the battery as well as to IAF [[headquarters]]. On the commander's right sits the engagement officer, who ensures that targets are assigned to other engagement officers sitting on the right-hand leg of the U. Each is assigned a geographical area to defend and two of the officers are more senior as they have an overview of Patriot batteries. To the left of the commander is the resource officer, who monitors the status and readiness of the missiles. On the left of the U sits the sky picture officer, who is in contact with the [[Home Front Command]] and uses the center's ability to predict impact point to alert the [[Civil defense in Israel|civil authorities]]. Also at these consoles are an [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] officer and an [[After Action Review|after-action]] / [[Debriefing|debrief]] officer, who uses recordings as it is impossible to absorb all the information during engagements.<ref name="Egozi2"/>  All in all, the "Golden Citron" is manned by 7<U+2013>10 operators.<ref name=Bar-Joseph />

In the late 1990s officials of [[Jordan]] have expressed concern that any conflagration between Israel and Iraq or Iran would impact its territory. The problem becomes more difficult for Jordan when the warheads are not conventional. Therefore [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], during his first term of office as Prime Minister of Israel, reportedly offered Jordan "a defensive umbrella of Arrow 2". Without allowing Israel to forward deploy the Arrow launchers close to the Iraqi border, the other option is for Israel to sell Jordan the Arrow system. This is most likely what Prime Minister Netanyahu meant above. In May 1999 Israel reportedly requested U.S. approval for selling Arrow batteries to Jordan, but apparently no such approval has been given yet.<ref name=dtic>{{cite web | author = [[Guermantes E.

In the past, the [[United Kingdom]], [[Japan]], and [[Singapore]] were mentioned as then potential foreign customers of the Arrow system.<ref name=global/><ref name=dtic /> [[Netherlands]] reportedly expressed interest in the "Golden Citron" [[C4ISTAR|C<sup>3</sup>I]] center in November 1999.<ref name=dtic />

For the United States, the Arrow has provided important technical and operational data.<ref name="jewish" /> It remains a key element in the Missile Defense Agency<U+2019>s plan for a layered missile defense architecture, and an example of a successful, affordable program. At the moment, however, the United States does not have any plans to procure and deploy the Arrow.<ref name=mstrt/> Nevertheless in September 2009 the Arrow system was mentioned by U.S. [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert Gates]] and [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] [[General (United States)|General]] [[James Cartwright]] among the alternative to the proposed [[US missile defense complex in Poland|U.S. missile defense assets in Europe]].<ref name="europe">{{cite web |url=http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=4479 |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] |title=DoD News Briefing with Secretary Gates and Gen.
