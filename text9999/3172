===Rapping technique===
{{Quote box|width=280px|align=left|quote="When I started rapping, people were trying to make me like the typical New York rapper, but I'm not that," Minaj says. "No disrespect to New York rappers, but I don't want people to hear me and know exactly where I'm from."|source =<U+2014>Minaj talking about her rapping technique in an interview with ''Billboard''.<ref name="billboard1"/>}}

Minaj is known for her animated rapping style, and her distinctive [[Rapping#Flow|flow]] separates her from other female rappers. She often combines [[metaphor]]s, [[Punch line|punchlines]], and [[wordplay]] into her work, which has received comparisons to her mentor, [[Lil Wayne]]. The ''[[New York Times]]'' described Minaj as "a sparkling rapper with a gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she's a rapid evolver, discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones."<ref>{{cite news|last=Caramanica |first=Jon |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/arts/music/nicki-minaj-is-the-influential-leader-of-hip-hop.html?pagewanted=all |title=Nicki Minaj Is the Influential Leader of Hip-Hop |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2012-03-30 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}</ref> Many critics describe her rap technique as [[Bubblegum pop|bubblegum]] [[Rapping|rap]], but Minaj explained in an interview with ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' magazine: "What people don't know is that before I was doing that craziness I was doing me, I was just doing regular sounding rap that anyone could hear and identify with. But once I started doing all that weird [expletive]<U+2014>im not mad at it because it got everyone<U+2019>s attention".<ref>{{cite web|author=Nigel D. |url=http://realtalkny.uproxx.com/2010/07/topic/topic/news/nicki-minaj-speaks-on-her-rap-style/ |title=Nicki Minaj Speaks On Her Rap Style &#124; RealTalkNY |publisher=Realtalkny.uproxx.com |date=2012-07-07 |accessdate=2012-08-02}}</ref> 

Her verse in [[Kanye West]]'s "[[Monster (Kanye West song)|Monster]]" was well received by critics, with many stating she had the best verse in the song, beating out well-established hip-hop artists Kanye West, [[Jay-Z]], and [[Rick Ross]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/article/3-reasons-nicki-minaj-crushes-all-boys-kanye-wests-monster-0 |title=3 Reasons Nicki Minaj Crushes All The Boys On Kanye West's "Monster" |publisher=Vibe |date=2010-08-31 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> Her alter-egos come alive in her lyrics varying from a [[British accent]], to her soft-spoken Harajuku Barbie. She has collaborated with a diverse array of musical artists from varied genres, including [[Britney Spears]], [[Eminem]], and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. Hip-hop artist [[Ice-T]] cosigns Minaj's rapping ability with an interview from [[Rolling Stone Magazine|Rolling Stone]] "She [Minaj] does her thing. She has her own way of doing it. She has an ill vocal delivery. She kind of reminds me of a female [[Busta Rhymes]], like how she throws her voice in different directions <U+2013> but she's no [[Lil' Kim]]".<ref>{{cite web|author=By&nbsp;Sowmya Krishnamurthy |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-ice-t-on-the-art-of-rap-why-nicki-minaj-is-real-hip-hop-20120611 |title=QA: Ice-T on 'The Art of Rap,' Why Nicki Minaj Is 'Real Hip-Hop' &#124; Music News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2012-06-11 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref>

''Billboard'' dissected Minaj's rap technique, saying, "Her multiple characters are indeed present on the set. In a matter of bars, Minaj switches effortlessly from the toned-down Onika to the energetic Nicki and then to her tempestuous alter ego, Roman Zolanski. She tosses off British and [[Jamaican accent]]s, animal-like growls, breathy vocals and rapid-fire rhymes with the blink-and-you'll-miss-it speed of a 14-year-old girl thumbing a [[text message]] in homeroom."<ref name="billboard1"/>

===Feud with Lil' Kim===

Lil' Kim reignited the feud following the release of her mixtape ''[[Black Friday (Lil' Kim mixtape)|Black Friday]]'', an album that directly referenced Minaj, through the title and songs such as "[[Did It On'em]]" (that became "Pissin' On'em"); the album artwork also portrayed Lil' Kim decapitating Minaj with a sword.<ref name="NY Daily News" /> A fragment of a [[diss track]] called "Tragedy" was released in response by Minaj in April 2011, the track featured the lyrics "Pink Friday, Eminem, 8 Mile/ It must hurt to sell your album on PayPal." and "Look at you now hoe, you just tragic".<ref>{{cite web|title=Music Nicki Minaj aims new diss at "tragic" Lil' Kim|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a312696/nicki-minaj-aims-new-diss-at-tragic-lil-kim.html|publisher=DigitalSpy|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>  Following the release of Minaj's second album, ''Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded'', critics suggested that the track "[[Stupid Hoe]]"<ref>{{cite web|title=Lil Kim Addresses Nicki Minaj's 'Stupid Hoe'|url=http://www.billboard.com/column/the-juice/lil-kim-addresses-nicki-minaj-s-stupid-hoe-1006206162.story|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref> may have contained attacks directed at Kim. Lil' Kim later suggested in an interview with ''105's Breakfast Club'' that the song "[[Pink Friday:Roman Reloaded|Automatic]]" from Minaj's second album was similar to her unreleased material, also calling Minaj "obnoxious" and "catty".<ref>{{cite web|title=Nicki Minaj 'A Very Obnoxious Person,' Lil' Kim Says|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1685303/lil-kim-nicki-minaj-power-105.jhtml|publisher=MTV|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>

But that's not bad. There's not a whole lot of female artists that you can make reference to, so you'll see those little influences even stronger.
