'''OfficeMax''' ({{NYSE|OMX}}), is an office supplies retailer founded in [[1988]] and headquartered in [[Naperville, Illinois]]. It is the third-largest [[office supplies]] retailer in the [[USA]], behind [[Staples (company)|Staples]] and [[Office Depot]]. 

==History==
===Kmart===
In [[1991]], [[Kmart]] acquired OfficeMax to join its other subsidiaries, [[Sports Authority]] and [[Builders Square]]. Shortly after the acquisition Kmart merged its other subsidiary, Office Square, into OfficeMax. Kmart also acquired BizMart and merged it into OfficeMax in 1992. Kmart, however, sold OfficeMax in [[1995]].

===Boise Cascade===
The company was acquired by [[Boise Cascade]] in [[2003]], and has undergone numerous internal changes since then, including rebranding its [[Photocopying|copy]] and [[Printing|print]] centers from '''CopyMax''' to '''OfficeMax Print & Document Services'''. This change was primarily to prevent customers from getting the idea that it was only a copy service. In Q4 2006 the company rolled out a new branding for their printing and finishing service after finding that OfficeMax Print & Document Services was too sterile of a name. The current name for the printing department is '''OfficeMax ImPress''' [http://www.officemax.com/max/solutions/services/CopyMax/CopyMax.jsp]. 

The [[furniture]] section of the retail stores is often marketed separately as '''FurnitureMax''', though officially only a few stores have true '''FurnitureMax''' sections, characterized by much larger selections than normal OfficeMaxes. OfficeMax has 867 retail stores in the [[USA]] (including [[Puerto Rico]]) and 43 locations in [[Mexico]] (through a joint venture), in addition to an on-line retailer in the [[USA]] (OfficeMax.com). In October 2004, Boise Cascade completed its sale of its paper, building products, and timberland assets. It then renamed itself OfficeMax.

===Financial Rebound===
In Q1 2006, OfficeMax closed 110 underperforming domestic stores, and is opening 70 new stores with the new award winning "Advantage" store layout.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://investor.officemax.com/EdgarDetail.cfm?CompanyID=OMX&CIK=12978&FID=1047469-06-3312&SID=06-00|title=OfficeMax: 10K Annual Report|accessdate=2006-07-05}}</ref> The "Advantage" store design is supposed to be more customer friendly and includes improvements in all major departments inside an OfficeMax store. The company plans to remodel most or all of its stores to the new Advantage layout.

In 2007, the average price per share of OfficeMax stock has risen to $50+.

==Customer Incentive Programs==
===Ink Cartridge Recycling===
OfficeMax originally offered only recycled paper in exchange for ink cartridges, at first limiting the cartridges to HP only, and 2 at a time, then later expanding it to HP, Lexmark, Dell, and Canon cartridges and 5 at a time. However, the customer was not required to purchase anything to redeem their cartridges. To help drive ink sales, customers today only have the option of recycling their cartridges for $3 each off of their purchase, up to 5. Inkjets recycling is limited to HP, Canon, Dell, Lexmark, or Brother cartridges.
Toner cartridges can also be recycled.

===OfficeMax, Ink...===
Starting in 2005 and ending early 2006, OfficeMax tested a semi-automated ink refill station in their stores in the Chicago area. Customers could bring in old HP, Lexmark, Dell, Canon, or Compaq cartridges, and have them tested and refilled. The cost of the refilling ranges from $2 below a new cartridge up to 50% off.

As of July 2006, OfficeMax is now outfitting all of their high profit stores with the ink refill machines. Stores in the Houston districts were the first to receive the new machines.

===MaxPerks===
MaxPerks is a free incentive program where the customer receives a percentage of their purchases back via gift cards. A business maxperks customer receives between 1%-2% of their purchases. The minimum amount spent in order to receive a 1% rebate is $300. The more the customer spends, the more they get back at the end of each quarter in the form of a gift card. Teachers' MaxPerks benefits are different; for every $75 the customer spends, he or she gets back $10 with a yearly rebate limit of $100. Through this program, the customer also receives many coupons through the mail.

Owners of OfficeMax credit cards can also earn double the amount of MaxPerks points one would normally.

===OfficeMax Credit Cards===
The OfficeMax Credit Card comes in three forms:
<br>Personal
<br>Business
<br>Corporate
<br>To sign up for the credit card you can ask any associate at OfficeMax. It is an instant sign up process where you sign up for the card, and OfficeMax can get you your card number within minutes. With approval, you will receive 10% off any store purchase on the first purchase on the OfficeMax credit card, and won't have any payments, or any interest on the credit card until 2009.

===MaxAssurance===
MaxAssurance is a replacement plan that OfficeMax offers on any electronic device, or furniture item. They are prices compared to the price of the product starting at $2.99 for any electronic item below $25.00, and go up to $359.99 on Laptop Computer above $1,999.99 and on furniture above $6,999.99.

MaxAssurance covers many things such as normal wear and tear, and accidental damage.  The coverage of accidental damage is a key selling point for employees.

Coverage for different items is different. On any electronic item below $400, the MaxAssurance can cover 2 years on top of the manufacturer's limited warranty on items $50 or more, otherwise you can only purchase a 1 year MaxAssurance from OfficeMax for any electronic item $49.99 and lower. This is the only actual replacement plan that OfficeMax Offers, the other MaxAssurances are Repair Plans, where OfficeMax would come on site, and fix it for you, if it can't be fixed, then it would be replaced. With this, OfficeMax also has a "No Lemon" policy, meaning that if the repaired item breaks more than 3 times, they will replace it anyways.
On Electronics above $400 there is a 1, 2, and 3 year repair plan, it works though the manufacturer's warranty, and the years on the plan start after the manufacturer's warranty.
With Furniture, the MaxAssurance is 3 years starting 31 days after the date of purchase, and though those 31 days.
On the computer MaxAssurance, they are priced differently for the Laptop Computers, from the Desktop Computers. The coverage starts the second you leave the store and cover for 3 years. With the Computer MaxAssurance, the MaxAssurance will cover up to 2 peripherals to the computer, such as Keyboard, Mouse, Monitor, Speakers, etc.

===Instant Rebates===
In 2006, OfficeMax rolled out its new rebate program. All of OfficeMax's rebates are now instant and come off the regular price at point of sale.

===Price Matching===
OfficeMax also offers Price Matching. OfficeMax will Price Match any product except computers, as long as they are the same product. Even if you were to buy something from OfficeMax and find the same product for 2 cents cheaper within 14 days of the purchase, OfficeMax will credit you the 2 cents, with proof. OfficeMax will also Price Match on a major competitor's sale price, as long as the sale price at the other store is an instant in store rebate. As of June 2007 OfficeMax officially does not price match competitors on Laptops or Desktop Computers.

==Advertising==
For most of the chain's history, their advertising [[mascot]] was a faceless [[animation|animated]] [[stick figure]] called "StickMax". Sometimes, it was even [[Dilbert (Comic strip)]]. In [[2004]], OfficeMax unveiled a new mascot called "Rubberband Man", portrayed by actor [[Eddie Steeples]]. The "Rubberband Man" was phased out and replaced by a new mascot called "Max".

==False Rebate Claims==

In 2005, OfficeMax was investigated by the the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in regards to "accounting for vendor income."  According to OfficeMax, the company had falsified $3.3 million in rebate claims owed by its suppliers. In that year the company fired three CEO's as well as six other employees.
