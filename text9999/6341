{{for|the Australian cricketer nicknamed "Dizzy"|Jason Gillespie}}

'''John Birks "Dizzy" Gillespie''' [/g<U+026A><U+02C8>l<U+025B>spi/] (October 21, 1917 &ndash; January 6, 1993) was an [[United States|American]] [[jazz]] [[trumpet]]er, [[bandleader]], [[singer]], and [[composer]]. He was born in [[Cheraw, South Carolina]], the youngest of nine children. Dizzy's father was a local bandleader, so instruments were made available to Dizzy. He started to play the piano at the age of 4. Together with [[Charlie Parker]], he was a major figure in the development of [[bebop]] and [[modern jazz]]. 

In addition to featuring in these epochal moments in bebop, he was instrumental in founding [[Afro-Cuban jazz]], the modern jazz version of what early-jazz pioneer [[Jelly Roll Morton]] referred to as the "[[Spanish Tinge]]". Gillespie was a trumpet [[virtuoso]] and gifted [[improvisation|improviser]], building on the virtuoso style of [[Roy Eldridge]] but adding layers of [[harmony|harmonic]] complexity previously unknown in jazz. In addition to his instrumental skills, Dizzy's [[beret]] and horn-rimmed spectacles, his [[scat singing]], his bent horn, pouched cheeks and his light-hearted personality were essential in popularizing bebop.  He had an enormous impact on subsequent trumpeters, both by the example of his playing and as a mentor to younger musicians.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Dizzy's first pro job was with the Frank Fairfax orchestra in 1935, after which he joined the respective orchestras of Edgar Hayes and subsequently [[Teddy Hill]], essentially replacing his main influence [[Roy Eldridge]] as first trumpet in 1937. In 1939, Gillespie joined up with [[Cab Calloway]]'s orchestra, with which he recorded one of his earliest compositions, the instrumental "Pickin' The Cabbage", in 1940 (originally released on the Vocalion label, #5467, on 78rpm - said 78rpm record backed with a co-composition with Cab's drummer at the time, [[Cozy Cole]], entitled "Paradiddle"). After Dizzy left Calloway in late 1941, over a notorious incident with a knife, he freelanced with a few bands - most notably being [[Ella Fitzgerald]]'s orchestra, composed of members of the late [[Chick Webb]]'s band, in 1942. In 1943, Gillespie then joined up with the [[Earl Hines]] orchestra. The legendary [[big band]] of [[Billy Eckstine]] gave his unusual harmonies a better setting, and it was as a member of Eckstine's band that he was reunited with Parker, after earlier being members of [[Earl Hines]]'s more conventional band.

===The rise of bebop===
[[Image:Dizzy Gillespie 4.jpg|thumb|right|200px|1977]]
With [[Charlie Parker]], Gillespie jammed at famous jazz clubs like [[Minton's Playhouse]] and [[Monroe's Uptown House]], where the first seeds of bebop were planted. Gillespie's compositions like "[[Groovin' High]]", "Woody n' You", "[[Salt Peanuts]]", and "[[A Night in Tunisia]]" sounded radically different, harmonically and rhythmically, than the [[Swing (genre)|Swing]] music popular at the time. One of their first (and greatest) small-group performances together was only issued in 2005: a concert in New York's Town Hall on [[June 22]], [[1945]]. Gillespie taught many of the young musicians on [[52nd Street]], like [[Miles Davis]] and [[Max Roach]], about the new style of jazz. After a lengthy gig at Billy Berg's club in Los Angeles, which left most of the audience ambivalent or hostile towards the new music, the band broke up. Unlike Parker, who was content to play in small groups and be an occasional featured soloist in big bands, Gillespie aimed to lead a big band himself; his first attempt to do this came in 1945, but it did not prove a success.

After his work with Parker, Gillespie led other small combos (including ones with [[Milt Jackson]], [[John Coltrane]], [[Lalo Schifrin]]) and finally put together his first successful big band. He also appeared frequently as a soloist with [[Norman Granz]]'s [[Jazz at the Philharmonic]]. He also headlined the 1946 independently-produced musical revue film ''[[Jivin' in Be-Bop]]''.<ref>[http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=reviews&Id=6365 <U+201C>Jivin<U+2019> in Be-Bop (DVD), Film Threat, August 17, 2004]</ref>

In 1948 Dizzy was involved in a traffic accident when the bicycle he was riding was bumped by an automobile. He was slightly injured, and found that he could no longer hit the B-flat above high C. He won the case, but the [[jury]] only awarded him $1000, in view of his high earnings up to that point. <ref>(Source: ''Ready for the Plaintiff!'' by [[Melvin Belli]], 1956.)</ref>

On [[March 11]], 1952 Gillespie left for [[France]] after being invited by [[Charles Delaunay]] to play on ''Salon du Jazz''.<ref>Tercinet, Alain, Booklet of ''The Great Blue Star Sessions 1952-1953''</ref> Gillespie did not have any other commitments during his time in [[Paris]] and on his Blue Star sessions and started to assemble his third big band. Due to his prior success he could now record in the finest studios like Th<U+00E9>atre des Champs-Elys<U+00E9>es. In 1953 he returned to the United States after a series of successful concerts and recordings, and the 1953 line-up of the Dizzy Gillespie/Stan Getz Sextet featured Gillespie, [[Stan Getz]], [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Herb Ellis]], [[Ray Brown (musician)|Ray Brown]] and [[Max Roach]]. As well as his work with Getz, he also recorded on a couple of occasions with saxophonists [[Sonny Rollins]] and [[Sonny Stitt]].

In 1956 he organized a band to go on a State Department tour of the Middle East and earned the nickname "the Ambassador of Jazz".<ref>[http://www2.wwnorton.com/college/music/enj9/shorter/composers/dizzy.htm from Ken Burns's Jazz, A Gillespie Biography]</ref><ref>[http://www.pbs.org/jazz/biography/artist_id_gillespie_dizzy.htm Ken Burns's Jazz, A Gillespie Biography]</ref>

===Afro-Cuban music===
In the late 1940s, Gillespie was also involved in the movement called [[Afro-Cuban music]], bringing [[Latin American music|Latin]] and African elements to greater prominence in jazz and even [[pop music]], particularly [[salsa music|salsa]]. Gillespie's most famous contributions to Afro-Cuban music are the compositions "Manteca" and "Tin Tin Deo"; he was responsible for commissioning [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell's]] "Cubano Be, Cubano Bop", which featured the great but ill-fated Cuban conga player, [[Chano Pozo]]. In 1977, Gillespie discovered [[Arturo Sandoval]] while researching music during a tour of Cuba.

===Later years and death===

Unlike his contemporary Miles Davis, Gillespie essentially remained true to the bebop style for the rest of his career.

In 1960, he was inducted into the ''Down Beat'' [[Down Beat|Jazz Hall of Fame]].

In 1964 the artist put himself forward as a presidential candidate. He promised that if he were elected, the [[White House]] would be renamed "The Blues House," and a cabinet composed of [[Duke Ellington]] (Secretary of State), [[Miles Davis]] (Director of the [[CIA]]), [[Max Roach]] (Secretary of Defense), [[Charles Mingus]] (Secretary of Peace), [[Ray Charles]] ([[Library of Congress|Librarian of Congress]]), [[Louis Armstrong]] (Secretary of Agriculture), [[Mary Lou Williams]] (Ambassador to the Vatican), [[Thelonius Monk]] (Travelling Ambassador) and [[Malcolm X]] ([[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]).<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/pip/4y7yo/?focuswin BBC radio broadcast on Gillespie's 1964 presidential campaign.]</ref><ref>"The Winter in Lisbon" CD booklet.</ref>
He also said his running mate would be [[Phyllis Diller]].

Gillespie published his [[autobiography]], ''[[To Be or Not to Bop]]'' in 1979. 

In the 1980s, Dizzy Gillespie led the United Nation Orchestra. For three years [[Flora Purim]] toured with the Orchestra and she credits Gillespie with evolving her understanding of jazz after being in the field for over two decades.<ref name="Jazzreview" >[http://www.jazzreview.com/articleprint.cfm?ID=1202 Beatrice Richardson for JazzReview interviews Flora Purim - Queen of Brazilian Jazz]</ref> [[David S<U+00E1>nchez (musician)|David S<U+00E1>nchez]] also toured with the group and was also greatly affected by Gillespie.  Both artists later were nominated for Grammy awards. Gillespie also had a guest appearance on ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' as well as ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. 

In 1982, Dizzy Gillespie had a cameo on [[Stevie Wonder]]'s hit ''Do I Do''. Gillespie's tone gradually faded in the last years in life, and his performances often focused more on his proteges such as [[Arturo Sandoval]] and [[Jon Faddis]]; his good-humoured comedic routines became more and more a part of his live act. 

[[Image:Dizzy StewartBW.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dizzy Gillespie with drummer [[Bill Stewart (musician)|Bill Stewart]] at 1984 [[Stanford Jazz Workshop]]]]

In 1988, Gillespie had worked with Canadian flautist and saxophonist Moe Koffman on their prestigious album ''Oop Pop a Da.'' He did fast scat vocals on the title track and a couple of the other tracks were played only on trumpet. 

In 1989 Gillespie gave 300 performances in 27 countries, appeared in 100 U.S. cities in 31 states and the District of Columbia, headlined three television specials, performed with two symphonies, and recorded four albums. He was also crowned a traditional chief in Nigeria, received the ''Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres'' -- France's most prestigious cultural award -- was named ''regent professor'' by the University of California, and received his fourteenth [[Honorary degree|honorary doctoral degree]], this one from the [[Berklee College of Music]]. In addition, he was awarded the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] the same year. The next year, at the [[Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] ceremonies celebrating the centennial of American jazz, Gillespie received the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] Award and the [[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers]] ''Duke Ellington Award'' for 50 years of achievement as a composer, performer, and bandleader.<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30611FF3B5C0C778DDDAB0994D8494D81 Pop/Jazz; A Tribute For Gillespie And the Jazz He Created]</ref><ref>[http://www.jazzwithbobparlocha.com/what/jazzbios/jazzbio_dizzy_gillespie.html Jazz with Bob Parlocha - Biographies - Dizzy Gillespie]</ref>

[[Image:Sergio Caputo io e Dizzy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Dizzy Gillespie with the Italian singer [[Sergio Caputo]].]] 
November 26, 1992 at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York, following the Second [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> World Congress]] was Dizzy's 75th birthday concert and his offering to the celebration of the centenary of the passing of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h. Gillespie was to appear at Carnegie Hall for the 33rd time. The line-up included: [[Jon Faddis]], Marvin "Doc" Holladay, [[James Moody (Saxophonist)|James Moody]], [[Paquito D'Rivera]], and [[Mike Longo|the Mike Longo Trio]] with [[Ben Brown]] on bass and [[Mickey Roker]] on drums. But Gillespie didn't make it because he was in bed suffering from cancer of the pancreas. "But the musicians played their real hearts out for him, no doubt suspecting that he would not play again. Each musician gave tribute to their friend, this great soul and innovator in the world of jazz."<ref>[http://bahai-library.org/bafa/g/gillespie.htm The Spiritual Side of Dizzy by Lowell Johnson]</ref>

Gillespie also starred in a film called "The Winter in Lisbon" released in 2004.<ref>[http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=15959 "The Winter in Lisbon" Dizzy Gillespie | Milan Records (2004)]</ref> He has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 7057 [[Hollywood Boulevard]] in the [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] section of the [[Los Angeles, California|City of Los Angeles]]. He is honored by the Dec 31, 2006 - A Jazz New Year's Eve: Freddy Cole & the Dizzy Gillespie All-Star Big Band at The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.<ref>[http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/jazz/schedule.html  The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts Schedule 2006-7]</ref>

He died of [[pancreatic cancer]] January 6, 1993, aged 75, and was buried in the [[Flushing Cemetery]], [[Queens, New York]]. [[Mike Longo]] delivered a eulogy at his funeral. He was also with Gillespie on the night he died, along with Jon Faddis and a select few others.

At the time of his death, Dizzy was survived by his widow, Lorraine Willis Gillespie; a daughter, jazz singer [[Jeanie Bryson]]; and a grandson, Radji Birks Bryson-Barrett. Gillespie had two funerals. One was a Bah<U+00E1><U+00B4><U+00ED> funeral at his request, at which his closest friends and colleagues attended. The second was at the [[Cathedral of St. John the Divine]] in New York open to the public.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDA163BF93BA35752C0A965958260 Dizzy Gillespie Memorial]</ref>

Dizzy Gillespie, a Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> since 1970, was one of the most famous adherents of the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith]] which helped him make sense of his position in a succession of trumpeters as well as turning his life from knife-carrying roughneck to global citizen, and from alcohol to ''soul force'', in the words of author [[Nat Hentoff]], who knew Gillespie for forty years.<ref>[http://jazztimes.com/columns_and_features/final_chorus/index.cfm?id=46 Remembering Dizzy]</ref><ref>[http://bahai-library.com/index.php5?file=shipton_groovin_high_gillespie Groovin' High The Life of Dizzy Gillespie] by Alyn Shipton</ref><ref>[http://bahai-library.com/file.php5?file=pokorny_shipton_groovin_high&language=All Groovin' High: The Life of Dizzy Gillespie] Review by Brad Pokorny</ref> He is often called the ''Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Jazz Ambassador''.<ref>[http://www.unbf.ca/clubs/abs/dizzy.htm The Baha'i Voice Presents:Dizzy Gileespie, Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Jazz Ambassador]</ref> He is honored with weekly jazz sessions at the New York Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Center.<ref>[http://www.bcca.org/communities/us/ny/nyc/jazz.html Jazz @ the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Center]</ref>

== Origins of iconic "bent" trumpet ==
Gillespie's image is almost inseparable from his trademark trumpet whose bell was bent at a 45 degree angle rather than a traditional straight trumpet.  In honor of this trademark, the [[Smithsonian|Smithsonian's]] [[National Museum of American History]] has collected Gillespie's B-flat trumpet.<ref name="NMAH">{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&objkey=62|title=Dizzy Gillespie's B-flat trumpet|publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref>  According to Gillespie's autobiography, this was originally the result of accidental damage caused during a job on January 6, 1953, but the constriction caused by the bending altered the tone of the instrument, and Gillespie liked the effect. Gillespie's biographer Alyn Shipton writes that Gillespie likely got the idea when he saw a similar instrument in 1937 in Manchester, England while on tour with the [[Teddy Hill]] Orchestra. Gillespie came across an English trumpeter who was using such an instrument because his vision was poor and the horn made reading music easier. According to this account (from British journalist Pat Brand) Gillespie was able to try out the horn and the experience led him, much later, to commission a similar horn for himself. 

Whatever the origins of Gillespie's upswept trumpet, by June, 1954, Gillespie was using a professionally manufactured horn of this design, and it was to become a visual trademark for him for the rest of his life.<ref>Shipton, Alyn.
