The '''2006-07 Australian bushfire season''' had an early start with fires in spring time.  Eastern and south-eastern Australia has been suffering below average rainfall for a number of years and the [[Drought in Australia#Rainfall deficiencies in 2006|winter and spring rains of 2006]] were some of the lowest on record.  [[Drought in Australia|Major droughts in Australia]] have often been accompanied by severe [[bushfire]]s; for example the  [[Black Friday (1939)|Black Friday fires of 1939]], the [[1967 Tasmanian fires]] and the  [[Ash Wednesday fires|Ash Wednesday fires of 1983]] were all associated with drought. 
== September 2006 ==

On [[24 September]] [[2006]], [[bushfire]]s began burning in various places in the [[Southern Highlands, New South Wales|Southern Highlands]], [[Shoalhaven]], [[Hawkesbury River]] and [[Hunter Valley]] regions of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. 

Declarations under Section 44 of the ''Rural Fires Act, 1997'' were issued by the [[New South Wales Rural Fire Service]] for the Newcastle, Hawkesbury/Baulkham, Redhead (Lake Macquarie), Shoalhaven and Wollondilly bushfires, enabling the "Commissioner is to take charge of bush fire fighting operations and bush fire prevention measures and to take such measures as the Commissioner considers necessary to control or suppress any bush fire in any part of the State...."<ref>[http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/fragview/inforce/act+65+1997+pt.3-div.1-sec.44+0+N S44 Rural Fires Act link]</ref>

Seven (7) houses were burned out, four at [[Picton, New South Wales|Picton]], and also [[Thirlmere, New South Wales|Thirlmere]], and [[Oakdale, New South Wales|Oakdale]].  The wind was from the west and north-west and fed the fire conditions, hampering firefighting by the [[New South Wales Rural Fire Service]].<ref>{{cite news  | url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200609/s1747424.htm  | title= Homes lost in NSW bushfires    | publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation  | date= [[2006-09-24]]  | accessdate= 2006-12-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news  | url= http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20468177-2,00.html   | title= Wild weather claims life, homes | publisher= news.com.au News Limited| date= [[2006-09-24]]  | accessdate= 2006-12-11}}</ref>

On [[12 October]] [[2006]], bushfires burned through parts of [[Hobart]]'s eastern shore, encouraged by strong winds and unusually high temperatures.

{{wikinews|Blue Mountains fires burn out of control}}
In late [[2006 in Australia#November|November]] [[Sydney]] was covered in smoke after raging fires in the [[Blue Mountains]].  One of the major fires was lit by a lightning strike near Burra Korain Head inside the [[Blue Mountains National Park]] on 13 November. Some people have suggested that the Blue Gum Forest in the [[Grose River]] valley was severely damaged by backburning, though this remains to be ascertained scientifically.<ref>{{cite news | first= Gregg   | last= Borschmann | url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/the-ghosts-of-an-enchanted-forest-demand-answers/2006/12/10/1165685553891.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1  | title= The ghosts of an enchanted forest demand answers  | work=  | publisher= Sydney Morning Herald   | date=[[2006-12-11]]  | accessdate= 2006-12-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first= Gregg   | last= Borschmann | url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/the-burning-question/2006/12/10/1165685553945.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 | title= The burning question  | work=  | publisher= Sydney Morning Herald   | date=[[2006-12-11]]  | accessdate= 2006-12-12}}</ref>

In January 2007, several new bushfires were burning in the [[Gippsland]] region of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. By 18 January, the fires had been burning across Victoria for 48 days and over 10,000 km<U+00B2> had been burnt. Homes and other property and stock as been lost.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fire crews prepare for horrific conditions |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200701/s1828789.htm |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC News]] |date=[[2007-01-17]] |accessdate =2007-01-18}}</ref>

There was a significant fire in the [[Adelaide Hills]] of [[South Australia]], near the towns of [[Kangarilla, South Australia|Kangarilla]] and [[Echunga, South Australia|Echunga]], the [[Mount Bold Reservoir]], and in parts of [[Kuitpo Forest]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Property lost in Adelaide Hills blaze |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200701/s1824847.htm |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC News]] |date=[[2007-01-11]] |accessdate=2007-01-13}}</ref> See : [[Mt Bold Fire]].

An arsonist lit at least thirteen fires in the eastern hills near [[Harrogate, South Australia|Harrogate]], but most were contained with minimal damage to property.<ref>{{cite news |title=Authorities suspect Adelaide Hills bushfire deliberately lit |url=http://abc.net.au/news/items/200701/1821792.htm?sa |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC News]] |date=[[2007-01-05]] |accessdate=2007-01-13}}</ref>

On the 16th a bushfire burning out of control near the town of Benalla in Victoria's North East caused power to be cut to much of the state when ash and smoke severed major transmission powerlines connecting Victoria to the national power grid. The 40C temperature caused a huge demand for power which, when pared with the severing of the line, forced power company's to impose [[rolling blackouts]] across the state, including power loss to parts of Melbourne which resulted in traffic chaos across the city. Full power was restored at approximately 12:30 am the following day.<ref>http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/2/story.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10419482</ref><ref>http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21073319-1702,00.html</ref>

On January 17, fires crossed the [[Murray River]] into [[New South Wales]] and threatened [[Thredbo]]. With the fire 12 km from the town, 700 tourists were evacuated.<ref>{{cite news|title=Thredbo fire threat eases|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/thredbo-fire-threat-eases/2007/01/17/1168709797527.html| publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald|SMH]]| date=[[2007-01-17]]|accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref>

On January 21, a large fire began near the [[F3 Freeway (Australia)|F3 Freeway]] (Freeway which connects [[Central Coast, New South Wales|Central Coast]] to Sydney), this resulted in its closure due to the intensity of the flames and smoke levels.

On January 22, the fire broke containment lines and headed north thanks to wind levels and hot conditions, the fire also caused the closure of the [[Pacific Highway (Australia)|Pacific Highway]] and train line. The suburb of [[Berowra]] also came under direct threat with residents urged at the time to prepare their properties. The railway station and a train that had stopped there came perilously close to being consumed by the bushfire. Later on January 22, the fire front was slowly contained, allowing all three avenues to re-open by nightfall.
