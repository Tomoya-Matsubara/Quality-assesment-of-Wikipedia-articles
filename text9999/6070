'''Ole-Kristian Tollefsen''' (born [[29 March]], [[1984]] in [[Oslo, Norway|Oslo]], [[Norway]]) is a professional [[ice hockey]] player in the [[National Hockey League]]. He currently plays for the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] of the [[NHL]]. He currently wears #55.

==Playing career==
Ole-Kristian Tollefsen started his ice hockey career playing for [[Nes IK]]'s youth teams, after one of his friends had talked him into it. He played for teams in the club until he turned 16, when he moved to [[Lillehammer]], to attend [[Norges Toppidrettsgymnas]]. Tollefsen played with [[Lillehammer Ishockeyklubb]] for two seasons, spending most of that time on the senior team, instead of any of the club's two junior teams where a player his age should have spent that stage of career. During the 2001-02 season, he was a regular in the team's starting lineup as they reached fourth spot in the [[GET-ligaen|Norwegian Elite League]], and reached the play off semi-finals for a bronze medal. He also played for both the junior teams in their playoffs, getting a silver medal with the Elder Junior(Under-20) team, and the gold medal with the Younger Junior(U-18) team. Those medals was the last thing he did in the Norwegian league system, so far in his career.

After that impressive season, Tollefsen was drafted by the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] in the third round, 65th overall, in the [[2002 NHL Entry Draft]], something that made him one of the highest-drafted Norwegians ever (incidentally, the highest-drafted Norwegian ever, [[Dallas Stars]] prospect [[Marius Holtet]], went in the second round, as the 42nd overall pick in the same draft). 

The next stop for Tollefsen was the [[Western Hockey League]] where he played the next two seasons for the [[Brandon Wheat Kings]]. During his time in the WHL, he showed that he could adapt to the North American style of play. His physical style of play showed on the 2003-04 Blue Jackets training camp, when one of his hits put star player [[Geoff Sanderson]] out of play for a couple of weeks with an injury.

During the 2004-05 NHL lockout season, Tollefsen had signed for the Blue Jackets, but spent most of the season with the [[Syracuse Crunch]] of the [[American Hockey League]], but also had a short trip to the [[East Coast Hockey League]] where he played for the [[Dayton Bombers]].

For the [[2005-06 NHL Season]] he started the season in the AHL, but on November 23, he got his NHL debut in a 4-2 loss against the [[Phoenix Coyotes]]. He got an additional four games for the Blue Jackets, with two penalty minutes, before he was sent down to Syracuse again, where he spent the rest of the season.

He played in 70 of the Blue Jackets' games in the [[2006-07 NHL season]]. On November 10, he, and fellow Norwegian NHL player [[Patrick Thoresen]] played in the first game ever to have two Norwegian players facing each other, when the Blue Jackets hosted Thoresen's [[Edmonton Oilers]]. In [[Ken Hitchcock]]'s debut as the coach for the Blue Jackets, a November 24 away game against the [[Philadelphia Flyers]], Tollefsen had his first career NHL point when he assisted on [[Jason Chimera]]'s second period goal, he scored his first goal against the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] on March 20. 2007. He put up a scoring streak when he forced overtime against [[Detroit Red Wings]] in the next game, tying [[Espen Knutsen]]'s Norwegian NHL record. He accumulated 125 penalty minutes during the season, including fights against [[Mark Smith]], [[Joffrey Lupul]], [[Jordin Tootoo]] and [[Bill Guerin]].

Tollefsen is one of only five Norwegians to ever play in the NHL, the others being [[Bj<U+00F8>rn Skaare]], [[Anders Myrvold]], [[Espen Knutsen]], and [[Patrick Thoresen]].
