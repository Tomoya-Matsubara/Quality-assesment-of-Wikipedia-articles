'''Sebastiaan "Bas" Rutten''' ({{IPA-nl|<U+02C8>b<U+0251>s <U+02C8>r<U+028F>t<U+0259>n}}; born February 24, 1965) is a retired [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[mixed martial artist]], [[Karate]] and [[Taekwondo]] [[blackbelt]], and [[kickboxer]]. He was a [[List of UFC Champions#Heavyweight Championship|UFC Heavyweight Champion]], a three time [[List of Pancrase champions#Openweight Championship|King of Pancrase]] world champion, and finished his career on a 22 fight unbeaten streak (21 wins, 1 draw). He is currently the star of Punk Payback on [[Fuel TV]]<ref name="punk">http://fuel.tv/punkpayback</ref> and co-host of [[Inside MMA]] on [[HDNet]].

As a fighter, one of his favorite tactics was the [[liver shot]] (both punch and kick), and he popularized its use in MMA.<ref name="bas#1">[http://www.cagepotato.com/10-best-signature-moves-mma The 10 Best Signature Moves in MMA.] ''Bas Rutten's liver shot is #1.''</ref><ref>[http://www.mmaconvert.com/2009/01/05/bas-ruttens-love-of-the-liver-shot-explained/ The Origin of Bas Rutten's Love of the Liver Shot?]</ref> Rutten is known for his charisma and has capitalized on his celebrity since retiring from fighting in 1999. He has worked as a [[color commentator]] in several MMA organizations, including [[Pride Fighting Championships|Pride]], and has appeared in numerous television shows, movies, and video games. He also coaches MMA and has authored several instructional materials.

==Early life==
Rutten was born in [[Tilburg]], [[Netherlands]] and became interested in [[martial arts]] at age 11 after his family went on vacation to [[France]], the movie ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' starring [[Bruce Lee]] was playing at the local movie theatre. Bas could not get in because he was just 11 years old and the movie was rated 18+, so he and his friend sneaked into the theatre and after the movie he became addicted to martial arts.<ref name="bio">[http://www.basrutten.tv/biography.html Official biography]</ref> His conservative parents didn't allow him to pursue it at first. He started to train [[boxing]] at the backyard of an elementary school with a friend. He eventually trained in [[Tae Kwon Do]]. He was very committed and eventually earned a 2nd degree [[Black belt (martial arts)|Black Belt]]. He then began learning [[Kyokushin]] [[Karate]], and earned a 2nd degree Black Belt.<ref>{{cite web | title=Bas Rutten | url=http://www.pancrase.co.jp/data/prfl-e/rutten.html | publisher=PANCRASE Official Site | accessdate=2010-11-20}}{{ja icon}}</ref>

In high school, he was physically weak and had [[eczema]] on his hands for which he was occasionally bullied.

==Fighting career==
===Kickboxing===
At the age of 20 he started competing in [[Muay Thai]] [[kickboxing]]. He fought 16 times and won the first 14 by [[knockout]], 13 in the first round. He lost his final two fights by TKO.<ref name="bio" />

In perhaps the biggest fight of his kickboxing career, Rutten faced [[Frank Lobman]] for the European Muay Thai title on February 12, 1991. Lobman won the [[knockout]] in the first round.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g21YkcFnP8Y 1991 Bas Rutten vs Frank Lobman (12-02-1991)]</ref>

===Pancrase===
Rutten began his professional [[mixed martial arts]] career with the [[Pancrase]] organization in Japan. In 1993, Japanese pro wrestlers [[Masakatsu Funaki]] and [[Minoru Suzuki]] traveled to Holland to scout fighters for their new "hybrid wrestling" (Bushido wrestling) organization, featuring submission fighting, but with no closed fisted strikes to the face. A precursor to modern mixed martial arts, the organization was the first of its kind, and featured early MMA names [[Frank Shamrock]], [[Vernon White]], [[Maurice Smith (kickboxer)|Maurice Smith]], [[Ken Shamrock]], and [[Guy Mezger]].

Rutten dominated his first two fights in [[Pancrase]], winning each by KO. Rutten's first knockout was so brutal that his opponent Ryushi Yanagisawa (then the #4 ranked fighter in Japan) was carried from the ring and spent 2 days in a hospital. Rutten's striking was so powerful that, according to [[Frank Shamrock]], it often intimidated other fighters. [[Frank Shamrock]] said, "His kickboxing was devastating. It was something everybody feared. The other thing he had was a basic understanding of real fighting...Bas had that street fighter mentality."<ref>[http://www.kocosports.com/absolutenm/anmviewer.asp?a=18494&z=60 The overlooked origins of mixed martial arts: Part II]. KocoSports.com. Retrieved on 2010-11-15.</ref>

However, his lack (at that time) of ground-fighting experience led to a loss to the extraordinarily skilled [[Masakatsu Funaki]]. Rutten, realizing the importance of ground fighting, went to train with the master catch wrestler Funaki. The training paid off, as Rutten knocked out previously undefeated [[Minoru Suzuki]] with a [[liver shot]] from his knee. Rutten later said that this win was one of the happiest moments of his life.

Just 20 days later, Rutten faced another steep test, fighting future UFC champion [[Ken Shamrock]], who was then one of the best Pancrase fighters. Rutten turned in a hard effort but ultimately lost the fight via [[rear naked choke]]. Rutten bounced back after the loss to Shamrock with a submission win over [[Jason DeLucia]].

Rutten then participated in one of the biggest events in mixed martial arts history to date, the [[Pancrase - King of Pancrase Tournament Opening Round|King of Pancrase Tournament]]. The winner of this tournament would be crowned the first champion of [[Pancrase]]. He was one of the four #1 seeds in the tournament and his first fight was against MMA newcomer (and future [[UFC]] champion) [[Frank Shamrock]]. Rutten lost a close (and somewhat controversial) decision in a fight considered a large upset, considering Rutten was a #1 seed in the tournament and Shamrock was then unknown and making his MMA debut. 

Rutten found a measure of redemption after the upset loss in the first round of the [[Pancrase - King of Pancrase Tournament Opening Round|King of Pancrase Tournament]] by choking out expert grappler and [[Pancrase - King of Pancrase Tournament Second Round|King of Pancrase Tournament]] Finalist [[Manabu Yamada]] in his next fight. With such an impressive showing against the tournament finalist, Rutten then received a rematch and a title shot against tournament winner and then current [[List of Pancrase champions#Openweight Championship|King of Pancrase]] [[Ken Shamrock]] for the King of Pancrase title, but lost early in the fight via submission due to a [[kneebar]].

After his second loss to Shamrock, Rutten focused on grappling even harder than before and started training 2 to 3 times a day solely on submissions. Rutten won 7 out of his next 8 fights by submission. He put together a series of wins against future UFC champions [[Frank Shamrock]] and [[Maurice Smith (kickboxer)|Maurice Smith]] and eventually challenged King of Pancrase [[Minoru Suzuki]] for the title. Rutten beat Suzuki for the second time, winning his first [[List of Pancrase champions#Openweight Championship|King of Pancrase]] title. After putting his title defenses on hold due to an injury, Rutten returned to the ring and beat interim [[List of Pancrase champions#Openweight Championship|King of Pancrase]] [[Frank Shamrock]] for the undisputed King of Pancrase title.

Rutten then avenged his loss to MMA legend [[Masakatsu Funaki]] in 1996 in what is considered to be one of the greatest fights in Pancrase history. Rutten described the war with Funaki in an interview: {{cquote|"Before the fight when he came to me, he made that thumb over the neck, throat slashing motion like I was going to go down. I turned to my manager and said, "Okay, now I'm going to kill this guy, you watch". My game plan was to keep the fight going for 15 minutes...Funaki had never fought above 15 minutes. But then, like 12 minutes into it, while I'm still on my knees he kicks me in the head. I block, but for me that was an illegal thing to do. So right away I start, BANG, BANG, BANG, and he goes down. From that moment on, I totally destroyed him. You got to see the fight; it was a massacre. My palms were black from hitting him so hard. He had the gods on his side or something, because he stood up every time. I hit his face back on the mat and you hear it slam into the mat. His nose is all the way to the side, broke, they have to straighten it out. I go, "Oh my God, this guy can take a shot!" I kneed him so hard in the head. He went down four times. But the last knee I gave to him was like everything I had. I grabbed him by the head and kneed him. It was really like a [[Rocky (film series)|Rocky]] movie. I'm standing there and I fall backwards, and I'm totally out of breath. I get up and the referee holds my hand up. Then he lets my hand go and I drop again, BOOM! I was exhausted, I gave everything I had; I really wanted to destroy him. I broke his cheekbones and broke his nose, just because he said he was going to kill me. Oh, I was so angry at him. But afterwards, friends again...what a crazy sport this is, huh?" <ref>[http://www.tmuscle.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance_interviews/two_fisted_tman T NATION | MMA Legend Bas Rutten]. Tmuscle.com. Retrieved on 2010-11-15.</ref>}}

Rutten then defended his title against both [[Jason Delucia]] and [[Guy Mezger]] and in so doing became a three time [[List of Pancrase champions#Openweight Championship|King of Pancrase]]. In 1996, he relinquished his title to be present for the birth of his second daughter.<ref name="bio" /> Rutten returned to Pancrase, taking 8 more victories, bringing his unbeaten streak up to 19 straight fights.

Rutten left Pancrase as one of the most dominant fighters in the history of the organization. MMA legend [[Ken Shamrock]] was the only fighter Rutten did not avenge a loss to. In 2000, when Rutten was PRIDE FC's color commentator, a third fight with Shamrock was entertained. Rutten agreed to come out of retirement to fight Shamrock in PRIDE FC. However, Shamrock stated that he already beat Rutten twice and that a third time wasn't necessary. Later, in 2002, Rutten said that he would not fight Shamrock again even if it was offered to him because of the friendship they developed over the years, and that he could not put his mind and heart into fighting Ken.<ref>[http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/2003/articles/1044510784.php] {{Dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref>

===UFC===
In 1998, Rutten signed with the [[UFC]], the biggest [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] promotion in the [[United States]]. Rutten entered the UFC with a massive amount of hype; he was undefeated in his last 19 fights and was touted by the organization as the greatest martial artist on the planet. 

Rutten was originally scheduled to fight heavyweight champion [[Randy Couture]] in a title match for the [[UFC Heavyweight Championship]] in his first fight, but Couture had a contract dispute and left the UFC to sign with a different promotion. The title was then stripped from Couture and a tournament of sorts was set up to determine the next champion.

Rutten's first fight in his quest for the UFC belt was against [[Tsuyoshi Kohsaka]] at [[UFC 18]], which Rutten dramatically won by [[KO]] with just a minute left in overtime. 

On May 5, 1999, at [[UFC 20]], Rutten faced [[Kevin Randleman]] for the [[UFC Heavyweight Championship]]. The first four minutes consisted of Rutten taking a lot of punishment from his guard. However, after the fight was stood up to check Rutten's cut, Rutten landed a devastating liver kick to Randleman's body to turn the tide of the fight. Randleman's pace slowed down considerably after the liver kick, which ultimately helped Rutten score judges' points by being the more active fighter. Rutten pounded away at Randleman from inside his guard, using elbow strikes to open up cuts on top of Randleman's head and punching Randleman to the face. The fight went into overtime, with Rutten taking a very close split decision victory to become the [[UFC Heavyweight Championship|UFC Heavyweight Champion]]. Judging at that point was not based on the current 10 points per round system, but who the judges felt won the fight overall.

Rutten vacated the title later in the year, in order to drop down to [[middleweight (MMA)|middleweight]] (now known as [[light heavyweight (MMA)|light heavyweight]]) a weight closer to his natural weight, in a bid to try to become the first person to hold a UFC title in two weight classes.<ref name="bio" />

While training for his next UFC fight in 1999, Rutten suffered multiple serious injuries, including blowing out his [[knee]] (a long running injury), tearing his [[biceps]], and suffering a neck injury. He was forced to retire from MMA competition for the time being, by doctors orders.<ref name="bio" />

During his MMA career he became known for two particular things: his fondness of [[liver shot]]s and his habit of doing a jumping split after winning a fight.<ref name="bio" /> Rutten talked about the origins of the "Rutten Jump" on his website: "When I won my first fight in [[Pancrase]], I was so hyped that I jumped up in the splits to each side of the ring. Why? I don't know. But, it became my trademark and I had to do it after every fight that I won."<ref>FAQ: The Home of Bas Rutten. Wednesday, 3 November 2004</ref>

Former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion [[Tito Ortiz]] has credited Rutten for inspiration during his early days. Ortiz said; "I looked up to Bas Rutten. Bas was my idol. People were just so scared of fighting him, he was like the man. I thought that was what I need to do now. If I train as hard as he does then one day I'll be as good as him and two years later look where I am, I'm on top of the world. I'm got to say thanks to him, (Bas) for helping me out by making me believe in dreams."<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20010501002224/sfuk.tripod.com/interviews_01/tito_interview2.html Tito Ortiz interview by Pooch : Submission Fighting UK Interviews].

==Post-fight career==

After his retirement from fighting in 1999, Rutten focused on becoming an actor, getting small parts on TV shows such as  ''[[Martial Law (TV series)|Martial Law]]'', ''18 Wheels of Justice'', ''[[The King of Queens]]'', "Lights Out" and the [[Canadian]] series ''Freedom'', as well as appearing in low budget movies such as ''[[Shadow Fury]]'', ''[[The Eliminator (film)|The Eliminator]]'', and the comedy short ''The Kingdom of Ultimate Power'' which was featured in the 2005 [[L.A. Film Festival]]. It also won the first prize at the short film festival in NY for "best comedy".

Rutten performed a few times for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling|NJPW]] from 2000 to 2002, including an IWGP title match against [[Yuji Nagata]].

Rutten was also the [[color commentator]] for the English productions of [[Pride Fighting Championships]] events, calling nearly every event from [[Pride 1]] through the 2005 Grand Prix.  Known for his sense of humor and first hand knowledge of the sport, Rutten quickly became a fan favorite commentator. In April 2006 he announced that he would not continue to announce for Pride, due to the constant flying to Japan, and being away from his family every month.<ref>[http://www.mmaontap.com/mma/entry/bas-rutten-exposes-gary-jerry-millen/ Bas Rutten exposes Gary "Jerry" Millen]</ref>

Rutten has a cameo in the video game "[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]" on the in-game TV show called "The Men's Room."<ref>[http://mmamania.com/2008/04/29/grand-theft-auto-iv-bas-rutten-is-hilarious/ GTA4: Rutten is hilarious]</ref> He also did motion capture for the main character's fighting moves. He said that when he arrived at the motion-capture place in New York he asked the people in charge how violent they wanted to have it and they told him to "give it all he got". After two hours they stopped him and said, "It's OK, you don't have to go any further".<ref name="gtamotion">[http://www.mmamadness.com/bleedingedge.html?bleedingedge_id=1626 Bas in GTA4]</ref>

He was also featured in [[WCW vs. the World]] for the PlayStation, but was named "Thunder Dome" to avoid copyright laws.

On January 23, 2008, he was announced as the new Vice President, Fighter Operations reporting directly to IFL CEO Jay Larkin. His role was to build relations between the IFL and its fighters as well as work on potential match-ups between fighters. He also hosted the weekly shows "Battleground" and "International Fight League" with [[Kenny Rice]]. This all ended when IFL went out of business in late 2008.

Currently, he and Rice host ''[[Inside MMA]]'', a weekly MMA variety show on [[HDNet]]. The pair also did remote English commentary and play-by-play for [[Dream (mixed martial arts)|Dream]] events broadcast in North America on HDNet. The pair were eventually replaced by [[Guy Mezger]] and [[Michael Schiavello]], who attend the events live in Japan. He is currently appearing in public health service ads, airing on [[Cartoon Network]].

===Coaching===
He is certified as an instructor of both MTBN [[Muay Thai|Thai Boxing]] and  [[Pancrase]].

Rutten coached [[Mark Kerr (fighter)|Mark Kerr]] during the filming of the [[HBO]] documentary ''[[The Smashing Machine: The Life and Times of Extreme Fighter Mark Kerr|The Smashing Machine]]''.

In 2006 Rutten was tapped to coach a team for the [[International Fight League]], an MMA organization that focused on team combat. His team, the [[Anacondas]], defeated the [[Quad City Silverbacks|Silverbacks]] 3<U+2013>2.

Rutten is a former investor in the Legends MMA gym in Hollywood and used to teach there occasionally.<ref>[http://www.fightmagazine.com/mma-magazine/mma-article.asp?aid=90&issid=8 Legends Gym: Bright Lights, Big City]</ref>

Rutten is now a part owner of the MMA gym Bas Rutten's Elite Mixed Martial Arts in Thousand Oaks, California.  He teaches an MMA class on Tuesdays.<ref>[http://www.elitemmagym.com Bas Rutten<U+2019>s Elite MMA Gym]</ref>

He also trained former street fighter [[Kimbo Slice]] for his professional MMA bouts, as well as former [[Ring of Honor]] champion and [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|TNA]] World champion [[Samoa Joe]].

===Last fight===
On May 2006, Rutten announced his return to MMA competition. Cleared by doctors to fight again, Rutten was slated to face [[Kimo Leopoldo]] in the now defunct [[World Fighting Alliance]] on July 22, 2006, at The Forum in Los Angeles. Two days before the event, Kimo tested positive for [[Stanozolol]], an [[anabolic]] [[steroid]]. In place of Kimo, Rutten fought [[Ruben Villareal|Ruben "Warpath" Villareal]]. Rutten took a first-round victory by way of technical knockout after low kicks left his opponent unable to stand. With that he brought up his professional record to 28 wins 4 losses and 1 draw.

==Personal life==
Rutten currently lives in [[Westlake Village, California]] with his  wife Karin and three daughters, Sabine who is 16, (pronounced Sa-bee-nuh), and twin daughters, Rachel (pronounced Rah-SHEL), and Bianca who are 12.<ref name="proelite">[http://tapoutpage.proelite.com/50735 Who's the Bas?]</ref>

Rutten is known by the moniker "[[wiktionary:guapo|El Guapo]]", which means "The Handsome One" in Spanish.  Rutten recently became a citizen of the United States.

===Tattoos===
Rutten has several [[tattoo]]s, each of which is intended to help him [[Spirituality|spiritually]] and [[emotionally]]:<ref>[http://www.blackbeltmag.com/archives/589 Bas Rutten: Exclusive Interview] in ''[[Black Belt Magazine]]''</ref>

During Rutten's career, whenever he had a fight, he would write two capital "R"s on the back of his hands with a magic marker. The "R" stood for ''Rustig'', the Dutch word for "calm". This was intended to help him remember to stay calm during his fights.
