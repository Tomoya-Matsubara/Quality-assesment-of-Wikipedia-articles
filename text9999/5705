The '''Church of Saint Anthony of Padua''' ([[Serbo-Croat-Bosnian]]: ''Crkva svetog Ante Padovanskog''/<U+0426><U+0440><U+043A><U+0432><U+0430> <U+0441><U+0432><U+0435><U+0442><U+043E><U+0433> <U+0410><U+043D><U+0442><U+0435> <U+041F><U+0430><U+0434><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0433>) is a [[Roman Catholicism in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Roman Catholic]] place of worship and a [[national monument]] in [[Sarajevo]], the capital city of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It is dedicated to the Franciscan friar [[Anthony of Padua]].

== Preceding buildings ==

The present Church of Saint Anthony of Padua was preceded by two places of worship dedicated to the same saint and built on the same site. The former was constructed in 1853 as the first Catholic church in Sarajevo since 1697, when the church dedicated to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], in the same neighbourhood, burned down during the [[Sack of Sarajevo]] by [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]]. The newly-built church received crosses, a canopy, an altar, a chalice and other eucharistic objects from the [[Second French Empire|French empress]] [[Eug<U+00E9>nie de Montijo]] in 1864. The church burned down in a great fire of Sarajevo in 1879.<ref name="bosnaargentina">{{citation|url=http://www.bosnasrebrena.ba/v2010/samostani-i-zupe/sarajevo/bistrik.html|title=Sarajevo / Bistrik <U+2013> samostan sv. Ante |website=Sarajevo / Bistrik <U+2013> samostan sv. Ante |accessdate=1 April 2015|language=Croatian}}</ref> Another building was construed in 1881, but it was small and humble, made almost entirely of wood and [[adobe]]. As the only Catholic church in the city, it was ceded by the [[Bosna Argentina|Bosnian Franciscans]] to the first [[Archbishop of Vrhbosna]] [[Josip <U+0160>tadler]], who used it as his residence from 1881 until the consecration of the [[Sacred Heart Cathedral, Sarajevo|Sacred Heart Cathedral]] in 1889. The old church was returned to the Franciscan friars. It was not, however, built to endure for long. By 1905, it had detoriated to the point where it had to be closed.<ref name="bosnaargentina"/><ref name="svanto">{{citation|url=http://svantosarajevo.org/?page_id=535|title=O crkvi|website=www.svantosarajevo.com|accessdate=1 April 2015|language=Croatian}}</ref>

== Architecture and art ==
The demolition of the old church took place in 1912. A new building, an example of [[Gothic Revival architecture]], was designed by [[Josip Vanca<U+0161>]] and erected in its place by the end of the same year. The tower took two more years, however, and the church was not consecrated until September 1914.<ref name="bosnaargentina"/><ref name="svanto"/>

The present interior of the church dates from the 1960s. Featuring works of the sculptors [[Frano Kr<U+0161>ini<U+0107>]]<ref name="bosnaargentina"/><ref name="svanto"/> and [[Iva Simonovi<U+0107>-Despi<U+0107>]],<ref name="svanto"/> painters [[Gabrijel Jurki<U+0107>]],<ref name="bosnaargentina"/> [[<U+0110>uro Seder]],<ref name="svanto"/> [[Ivan Me<U+0161>trovi<U+0107>]]<ref name="bosnaargentina"/> [[Edo Murti<U+0107>]],<ref name="bosnaargentina"/> [[Nada Pivac]],<ref name="bosnaargentina"/> and [[Oton Gliha]],<ref name="bosnaargentina"/> among others, the Church of Saint Anthony of Padua is one of artistically most important churches in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].<ref name="svanto"/> The adjacent monastery, built in 1894, houses the main archive of the [[Franciscan Province of Bosna Srebrena]].<ref name="bosnaargentina"/> The church survived the shelling during the 1992<U+2013>1996 [[Siege of Sarajevo]] remarkably unscathed, with significant damage being done only to the fa<U+00E7>ade and the stained glass windows.<ref name="svanto"/> The restoration was completed in the autumn of 2006.<ref name="svanto"/>

== Present status ==

While the monastery church is not presently a [[parish church]], it is significant as a shrine of Saint Anthony.<ref name="bosnaargentina"/> Unique among the numerous churches in Sarajevo, the Church of Saint Anthony of Padua claims to be the "church of all Sarajevans", boasting regular [[Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Muslim]] and [[Orthodox Christianity in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Eastern Orthodox]] attendees.<ref name="bosnaargentina"/><ref name="svanto"/><ref name="vecernji">{{citation|url=http://www.vecernji.ba/svetiste-u-koje-rado-dolaze-vjernici-svih-vjeroispovijesti-966770|title=Sveti<U+0161>te u koje rado dolaze vjernici svih vjeroispovijesti|website=www.vecernji.ba|accessdate=1 April 2015|language=Croatian}}</ref><ref name="nezavisne">{{citation|url=http://www.nezavisne.com/zivot-stil/nekretnine-vrt/Crkva-svih-Sarajlija-29049.html|title=Crkva svih Sarajlija|website=www.nezavisne.com|accessdate=1 April 2015|language=Bosnian}}</ref>
