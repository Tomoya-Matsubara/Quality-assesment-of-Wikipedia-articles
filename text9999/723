==History==

Mass was first said in the area in 1926 in a pavilion behind what was then the Station Hotel.{{efn|This now known as the Goshawk.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.thegoshawkpub.co.uk/| title = The Goshawk| accessdate = 30 March 2014| publisher = Woodward and Falconer Pubs}}</ref>}}  In the 1950s, the owners of the hotel bought land to the south of the hotel and gave it to the diocese.  The church was designed by [[F. X. Velarde]], and was opened in September 1955 by the Rt&nbsp;Revd&nbsp;Mgr&nbsp;[[John Murphy (bishop)|John Murphy]], [[Bishop of Shrewsbury]].  The church cost <U+00A3>7,000, and the detached campanile <U+00A3>1,000. In about 1958 the church became part of Tarporley parish.  The interior was reordered in 1976.<ref name=stock/>

==Architecture==
===Exterior===
St Cuthbert's is a small church designed to seat 72 people.  Its design is influenced by the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], together with some [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and Germanic references.  The exterior is faced with brick, the dressings are in artificial stone, and the church is roofed in [[Staffordshire]] tiles.  There is a detached campanile to the southeast of the church.  The church is orientated with the [[sanctuary#sanctuary as a sacred place|sanctuary]] at the west end; the following description will use the [[Orientation of churches|liturgical orientation]].  Its plan consists of a three-[[bay (architecture)|bay]] [[nave]] with a south [[sacristy]], a [[narthex]] at the west end, and an [[apse|apsidal]] sanctuary.  The narthex has two [[gable]]s, each containing a diamond-shaped window, and a main entrance on the north side.  The windows along the sides of the nave are paired [[lancet window|lancets]] separated by artificial stone [[mullion]]s carved with angels.  The sacristy has a south doorway, and windows on the south, west and east walls, those on the east having angel mullions.  The apse is without windows, but on the sides of the sanctuary are windows similar to those on the nave.  On the roof of the nave are three decorative cross [[finial]]s.  The brick campanile is almost {{convert|44|ft|m|1}} high, and it has a stone [[bellcote]] containing electronic speakers.  On the top is a copper pyramidal roof with a cross finial.<ref name=stock/><ref name=nhl/>

===Interior===
The interior of the church is in brick, with the ceilings and apse plastered.  In the nave are two wide diaphragm arches, and there is a similar arch at the entrance to the sanctuary.  The windows contain [[cathedral glass]], and the mullions are also carved on the interior with angels.  The [[Stations of the Cross]] are in wood that was carved in the [[South Tyrol]].  Behind the altar is a shelf on which is a tabernacle.  In the south wall of the nave are the entrances to the sacristy and the [[confessional]].  The narthex contains a small chapel.<ref name=stock/><ref name=nhl/>
