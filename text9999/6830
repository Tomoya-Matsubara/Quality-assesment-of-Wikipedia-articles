Morrison started his professional career when, as a teenager in the late 1950s, he played a variety of instruments including guitar, harmonica, keyboards and saxophone in a range of [[Irish showbands]] who covered the popular hits of the day before rising to prominence in the mid-1960s as the [[lead vocalist|lead singer]] of the gritty Northern Irish R&B band [[Them (band)|Them]] with whom he recorded the [[garage band]] classic, "[[Gloria (Them song)|Gloria]]". His solo career began under the [[pop music|pop]]-hit oriented guidance of [[Bert Berns]] with the release of the hit single "[[Brown Eyed Girl]]" in 1967.
After Berns' death, [[Warner Bros. Records]] bought out his contract and allowed him three sessions to record ''Astral Weeks'' in 1968.<ref>Turner (1993). pages 86 <U+2013> 90</ref>  Even though this album would gradually garner high praise, it was initially poorly received; however, the next one, ''Moondance'', established Morrison as a major artist,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_van_morrisons_moondance/|publisher=mixonline.com|title=Classic Tracks: Van Morrison's Moondance|date=2005-04-01|author=Eskow, Gary|accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref> and throughout the 1970s he built on his reputation with a series of critically acclaimed albums and live performances. Morrison continues to record and tour, producing albums and live performances that sell well and are generally warmly received, sometimes collaborating with other artists, such as [[Georgie Fame]] and [[The Chieftains]]. In 2008 he performed ''Astral Weeks'' live for the first time since 1968.

Much of Morrison's music is structured around the conventions of [[soul music]] and [[R&B]], such as the popular singles, "Brown Eyed Girl", "[[Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)]]", "[[Domino (Van Morrison song)|Domino]]" and "[[Wild Night]]". An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, loosely connected, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz, and [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] narrative, such as ''Astral Weeks'' and lesser-known works such as ''[[Veedon Fleece]]'' and ''[[Common One]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/index.php/exhibits/bio/C333S|title=SHOF: Van Morrison biography|publisher=songwritersshalloffame.org|accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref><ref name="VF review">{{Cite web|url=http://www.musthear.com/reviews/veedonfleece.html|author=Ballon, John|date=2008-12-28|title=Musthear review: Veedon Fleece|publisher=musthear.com|accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref> The two strains together are sometimes referred to as "Celtic Soul".<ref name= "Astral Weeks, Light">{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/2006/100albums/0,27693,Astral_Weeks,00.html|publisher=time.com|date=2006-11-13|author=Light, Alan|title=The All-Time 100 Albums|accessdate=2010-05-06}}</ref>

Morrison has received considerable acclaim, including six [[Grammy Award]]s, being inducted into both the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]], and appearing on several "Greatest Artists" lists.

Upon returning to Belfast in November 1963, the group disbanded,<ref name="TurnerPage33-38">Turner (1993), pages 33-38.</ref> so Morrison connected with Geordie Sproule again and played with him in the Manhattan Showband along with guitarist Herbie Armstrong.

==Them: 1964<U+2013>66==
{{Main|Them (band)}}
The roots of Them, the band that first broke Morrison on the international scene, came in April 1964 when Morrison responded to an advert for musicians to play at a new [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] club at the Maritime Hotel <U+2013> an old dance hall frequented by sailors.<ref>

The band's strong R&B performances at the Maritime attracted attention.   Them performed without a routine and Morrison [[ad lib]]bed, creating his songs live as he performed.<ref name="HintonPage40">Hinton (1997), page 40.</ref>  While the band did covers, they also played some of Morrison's early songs, such as "Could You Would You", which he had written in [[Camden Town]] while touring with The Manhattan Showband.<ref>Rogan (2006), page 76</ref> The debut of Morrison's "Gloria" took place on stage here. Sometimes, depending on his mood, the song could last up to twenty minutes. Morrison has stated that  "Them lived and died on the stage at the Maritime Hotel," believing that the band did not manage to capture the spontaneity and energy of their live performances on their records.<ref name="TurnerPage44">Turner (1993), page 44.</ref> The statement also reflected the instability of the Them lineup, with numerous members passing through the ranks after the definitive Maritime period. Morrison and Henderson would remain the only constants, and a highly unsuccessful version of Them even soldiered on after Morrison's departure.<ref>Heylin, Can You Feel the Silence?, p.118</ref>

[[Dick Rowe]] of [[Decca Records]] became aware of the band's performances, and signed Them to a standard two-year contract. In that period, they released two albums and ten singles, with two more singles released after Morrison departed the band. They had three [[record chart|chart]] hits, "[[Baby, Please Don't Go]]" (1964), "[[Here Comes the Night (Them song)|Here Comes the Night]]" (1965), and "[[Mystic Eyes]]" (1965),<ref>

Building on the success of their singles in the United States, and riding on the back of the [[British Invasion]], Them undertook a two month tour of America in May and June 1966 that included a residency from 30 May to 18 June at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in Los Angeles.<ref name="TurnerPage65">Turner (1993), pages 65 <U+2013> 66.</ref> [[The Doors]] were the supporting act on the last week,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.waiting-forthe-sun.net/Pages/Venues/whisky_them.html|author=Lawrence, Paul (2002)|title=The Doors and Them: twin Morrisons of different mothers|publisher=waiting-forthe-sun.net|accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref> and Morrison's influence on The Doors singer, [[Jim Morrison]], was noted by [[John Densmore]] in his book ''Riders On The Storm''.

Toward the end of the tour the band members became involved in a dispute with their manager, Decca Records' Phil Solomon, over the revenues paid to the band; that, coupled with the expiry of their work visas, meant the band returned from America dejected. After two more concerts in Ireland, Them split up. Morrison concentrated on writing some of the songs that would appear on ''Astral Weeks'', while the remnants of the band reformed in 1967 and relocated in America.<ref name="TurnerPage72-73">Turner (1993), pages 72-73.</ref>

[[Bert Berns]], Them<U+2019>s producer and composer of their 1965 hit, "[[Here Comes the Night (Them song)|Here Comes the Night]]", persuaded Morrison to return to New York to record solo for his new label, [[Bang Records]].<ref name="RoganPagep188">Rogan (2006), page 188.</ref> Morrison flew over and signed a contract he had not fully studied.<ref>Heylin, Can You Feel the Silence. p.144-147</ref> Then, during a two-day recording session at A & R Studios starting 28 March 1967, eight songs were recorded originally intended to be used as four singles.<ref>Turner, Too Late to Stop Now. p.76</ref> Instead, these songs were released as the album ''[[Blowin' Your Mind!]]'' without Morrison being consulted.

Over the next few years, he released a succession of albums, starting with a second one in 1970. ''[[His Band and the Street Choir]]'' had a free, more relaxed sound than ''Moondance'', but not the ''perfection'', in the opinion of critic [[Jon Landau]] who felt like "a few more numbers with a gravity of 'Street Choir' would have made this album as perfect as anyone could have stood."<ref name="HBATSC">{{Cite journal|url= http://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/2747/21378 | last =Landau | first =John | title =His Band and the Street Choir music review | magazine =Rolling Stone | date=4 February 1971| accessdate=2010-07-23}}</ref>  It contained the hit single "[[Domino (Van Morrison song)|Domino]]", which charted at number nine in the [[Billboard Hot 100]].<ref name="CollisPage122">Collis (1996), page 122.</ref>

Released in 1972, ''[[Saint Dominic's Preview]]'', revealed Morrison's break from the more accessible style of his previous three albums and moving back towards the more daring, adventurous, and meditative aspects of ''Astral Weeks''.

During a three-week vacation visit to [[Ireland]] in October 1973, Morrison wrote seven of the songs that would make up his next album, ''[[Veedon Fleece]]''.<ref name="TurnerPage122">Turner (1993), page 122.</ref> Though it attracted scant initial attention, its critical stature grew markedly over the years<U+2014>with ''Veedon Fleece'' now often considered to be one of Morrison's most impressive and poetic works.<ref name="RoganPage301">Rogan (2006), page 301.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:f9fyxqw5ld0e|publisher=allmusic.com|title=Veedon Fleece: Review|author=Ankeny, Jason & Jurek, Thom|accessdate=2009-05-13}}</ref> In a 2008 ''Rolling Stone'' review, Andy Greene writes that when released in late 1974: "it was greeted by a collective shrug by the rock critical establishment" and concludes: "He's released many wonderful albums since, but he's never again hit the majestic heights of this one."<ref name="Veedon Fleece">{{Cite journal| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/7910/38434 | last =Greene | first =Andy | title =Veedon Fleece Music Review | magazine =Rolling Stone | date=14 July 2008| accessdate=2010-07-23}}</ref>  "[[You Don't Pull No Punches, But You Don't Push the River]]", one of the album's side closers, exemplifies the long, hypnotic, cryptic Morrison with its references to visionary poet [[William Blake]] and to the seemingly [[Holy Grail|Grail]]-like Veedon Fleece object.<ref name="RoganPage300">Rogan (2006), page 300.</ref>

Morrison would not release a follow-up album for another three years.

The album received a mild critical reception and marked the beginning of a very prolific period of song making.

==''Common One'' to ''Avalon Sunset'': 1980&ndash;89==

The longest, "[[Summertime in England]]", lasted fifteen and one-half minutes and ended with the words,''"Can you feel the silence?"''. ''[[NME]]'' magazine's Paul Du Noyer called the album "colossally smug and cosmically dull; an interminable, vacuous and drearily egotistical stab at spirituality: Into the muzak."<ref name="HintonPage230">Hinton (1997), page 230.</ref> Even [[Greil Marcus]], whose previous writings had been favourably inclined towards Morrison, said: "It's Van acting the part of the 'mystic poet' he thinks he's supposed to be."<ref name="HeylinPage364">Heylin (2003), page 364.</ref> Morrison insisted that the album was never "meant to be a commercial album."<ref name="HeylinPage364">Heylin (2003), page 364.</ref> Biographer Clinton Heylin concludes: "He would not attempt anything so ambitious again.

Much of the music Morrison released throughout the 1980s continued to focus on the themes of [[spirituality]] and faith. His 1983 album, ''[[Inarticulate Speech of the Heart]]'' was "a move towards creating music for meditation" with synthesisers, uilleann pipes and flute sounds and four of the tracks were instrumentals.<ref name="TurnerPage153">Turner (1993), page 153.</ref> The titling of the album and the presence of the instrumentals were noted to be indicative of Morrison's long-held belief that "it's not the words one uses but the force of conviction behind those words that matters."<ref name="Inarticulate Speech of the Heart"/> During this period of time, Morrison had studied [[Scientology]] and gave "Special Thanks" to [[L. Ron Hubbard]] on the album's credits.<ref name="TurnerPage150">Turner (1993), page 150</ref>

''[[A Sense of Wonder]]'', Morrison's 1985 album, pulled together the spiritual themes contained in his last four albums, which were defined in a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' review as: "rebirth (''Into the Music''), deep contemplation and meditation, (''Common One''); ecstasy and humility (''Beautiful Vision''); and blissful, mantra like languor (''Inarticulate Speech of the Heart'')."<ref name="A Sense of Wonder">{{Cite journal| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/3045/21725 | last =Puterbaugh | first =Parke | title =A Sense of Wonder Music Review | magazine =Rolling Stone | date=9 May 1985| accessdate=2010-07-23}}</ref>  The single, "[[Tore Down a la Rimbaud]]" was a reference to [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and an earlier bout of [[writer's block]] that Morrison had encountered in 1974.<ref name="HeylinPage308">Heylin (2003), page 308.</ref> In 1985, Morrison also wrote the musical score for the movie, ''[[Lamb (film)|Lamb]]'' starring [[Liam Neeson]].<ref name="CollisPage162">Collis (1996), page 162.</ref>

==Live performances==
[[Image:VanMorrison smiling.jpg|thumb|right|A smiling Van Morrison performing at the Marin Civic Center, 2007.]]
By 1972, after being a performer for nearly ten years, Morrison began experiencing [[stage fright]] when performing for audiences of thousands, as opposed to the hundreds as he had experienced in his early career. He became anxious on stage and would have difficulty establishing eye contact with the audience. He once said in an interview about performing on stage, "I dig singing the songs but there are times when it's pretty agonizing for me to be out there." After a brief break from music, he started appearing in clubs, regaining his ability to perform live, albeit with smaller audiences.<ref name="Rolling Stone Interview"/>

[[Image:The Last Waltz.jpg|250px|left|thumbnail|Morrison performs in 1976 at [[The Band]]'s final concert filmed for ''[[The Last Waltz]]''.]]
On [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] 1976, Morrison performed at the farewell concert for [[The Band]]. Morrison's first live performance in several years, he considered skipping his appearance until the last minute, even refusing to go on stage when they announced his name. His manager, [[Harvey Goldsmith]], said he "literally kicked him out there."<ref name="HeylinPage313">Heylin (2003), page 313.</ref> Morrison was on good terms with The Band as near-neighbours in [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]], and they had the shared experience of stage-fright. At the concert, he performed two songs, including "[[Caravan (Van Morrison song)|Caravan]]", from his 1970 album ''Moondance''.  [[Greil Marcus]], in attendance at the concert, wrote: "Van Morrison turned the show around...singing to the rafters and ...burning holes in the floor. It was a triumph, and as the song ended Van began to kick his leg into the air out of sheer exuberance and he kicked his way right offstage like a Rockette. The crowd had given him a fine welcome and they cheered wildly when he left."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/lwgm.html|author=Marcus, Greil|date=1976-12-30|title=The Bands Last Waltz (Rolling Stone Magazine)|publisher=theband.hiof.no|accessdate=2007-03-31}}</ref> The filmed concert served as the basis for [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 1978 film, ''[[The Last Waltz]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/dvd_reviews/the_last_waltz|title=The Last Waltz|publisher=totalfilm.com|accessdate=2007-09-17}}</ref>

It was during his association with The Band that Morrison acquired the [[nickname]]s: "Belfast Cowboy" and "Van the Man". When Morrison sang the duet "4% Pantomime" (that he co-wrote with [[Robbie Robertson]]), [[Richard Manuel]] calls him, "Oh, Belfast Cowboy". It would be included in The Band's album ''[[Cahoots (album)|Cahoots]]''. When he left the stage, after performing "Caravan" on ''The Last Waltz'', Robertson calls out "''Van the Man!"''<ref name="Timepieces ITM"/>

On 21 July 1990, Morrison joined many other guests for [[Roger Waters]]' massive performance of ''[[The Wall - Live in Berlin]]'' with an estimated crowd of between three hundred thousand to half a million people and broadcast live on television.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rogerwaters.org/about_berlin.html|title=The Wall Live in Berlin|publisher=rogerwaters.org|accessdate=2998-07-07}}</ref> He sang "[[Comfortably Numb]]" with Roger Waters, and several members from The Band: [[Levon Helm]], [[Garth Hudson]] and [[Rick Danko]]. At concert's end, he and the other performers sang "[[The Tide Is Turning]]".

Morrison performed before an estimated audience of sixty to eighty thousand people when US President [[Bill Clinton]] visited Belfast, Northern Ireland on 30 November 1995. His song "[[Days Like This (song)|Days Like This]]" had become the official [[anthem]] for the [[Northern Ireland peace process|Northern Irish peace movement]].<ref name="RoganPage437">Rogan (2006), page 437.</ref>

The ''Astral Weeks'' band featured guitarist [[Jay Berliner]], who played on the album that was released forty years previously in November 1968. Also featured on piano was [[Roger Kellaway]].   A live album entitled ''[[Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl]]'' resulted from these two performances.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-morrison1-2008nov01,0,3773763.story?track=ntothtml|title=Van Morrison discusses Astral Weeks which he performs at the Hollywood Bowl|publisher=LA Times|author=Lewis, Randy|date=2008-11-01|accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref>  The new live album on CD was released on 24 February 2009,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123543248786353835.html|title=Van Morrison revisits 'Astral Weeks'|date=2009-02-24|publisher=wsj.com|author=Fusilli, Jim|accessdate=2009-02-24}}</ref>  followed by a DVD from the performances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blurt-online.com/reviews/view/849/|publisher=blurt-online.com|date=2009-02-18|author=Rosen, Steven|title=Van Morrison: Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl|accessdate=2009-02-24}}</ref> The DVD, ''[[Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl: The Concert Film]]'' was released via Amazon Exclusive on 19 May 2009.

==Collaborations==
During the 1990s, Morrison developed a close association with two vocal talents at opposite ends of their careers: [[Georgie Fame]] (with whom Morrison had already worked occasionally) lent his voice and Hammond organ skills to Morrison's band; and [[Brian Kennedy (singer)|Brian Kennedy]]'s vocals complemented the grizzled voice of Morrison, both in studio and live performances.

The 1990s also saw an upsurge in collaborations by Morrison with other artists, a trend continuing into the new millennium. He recorded with Irish folk band [[The Chieftains]] on their 1995 album, ''[[The Long Black Veil]]''. Morrison's song, "[[Have I Told You Lately]]" would win a Grammy Award for [[Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals]] in 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1996/grammys.htm|publisher=rockonthenet.com|title=38th Grammy awards-1996|accessdate=2008-09-24}}</ref>  He also produced and was featured on several tracks with blues legend [[John Lee Hooker]] on Hooker's 1997 album, ''[[Don't Look Back (John Lee Hooker album)|Don't Look Back]].''  This album would win a Grammy Award for [[Best Traditional Blues Album]] in 1998 and the title track "[[Don't Look Back (John Lee Hooker song)|Don't Look Back]]", a duet featuring Morrison and Hooker, would also win a Grammy Award for "Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals" in 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1998/grammys.htm|publisher=rockonthenet.com|title=40th annual Grammy awards <U+2013> 1998|accessdate=2009-04-10}}</ref>  Morrison additionally collaborated with [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] on his 1999 album ''[[Reload (Tom Jones album)|Reload]]'', performing a duet on "[[Sometimes We Cry]]", and he also sang vocals on a track entitled "The Last Laugh" on [[Mark Knopfler]]'s 2000 album, ''[[Sailing to Philadelphia]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://georgegraham.com/reviews/knopflr2.html|author=Graham, George D.|date=2000-10-25|title=Mark Knopfler:Sailing to Philadelphia|publisher=georgegraham.com|accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref> In 2004, Morrison was one of the guests on [[Ray Charles]]' album, ''[[Genius Loves Company]]'', featuring the two artists performing Morrison's "[[Crazy Love (Van Morrison song)|Crazy Love]]".

"The approach now is to sing from lower down [the diaphragm] so I do not ruin my voice. Before, I sang in the upper area of my throat, which tends to wreck the vocal cords over time.

The words may often be prosaic, and so can hardly be poetry."<ref name="CollisPage12">Collis (1996), page 10.</ref> Morrison has described his songwriting method by remarking that: "I write from a different place.

Critic [[Greil Marcus]] argues that given the truly distinctive breadth and complexity of Morrison's work, it is almost impossible to cast his work among that of others: "Morrison remains a singer who can be compared to no other in the history of rock & roll, a singer who cannot be pinned down, dismissed, or fitted into anyone's expectations."<ref name="MarcusPage447">Marcus (1992), page 447.</ref> Or in the words of [[Jay Cocks]]: "He extends himself only to express himself.

===Genre===
The music of Van Morrison has encompassed many genres since his early days as a [[blues]] and [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] singer in Belfast. Over the years he has recorded songs from a varying list of genres drawn from many influences and interests. As well as blues and R&B, his compositions and [[cover versions|covers]] have moved between [[pop music]], [[jazz]], [[rock music|rock]], [[folk music|folk]], [[country music|country]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[folk music of Ireland|Irish folk]] and [[Irish traditional music|traditional]], [[big band]], [[skiffle]], [[rock and roll]], [[New age music|new age]], [[classical music|classic]] and sometimes [[spoken word]] ("[[Coney Island (song)|Coney Island]]") and [[instrumental]]s.<ref name="HintonPage15">Hinton (1997), page 15.</ref> Morrison defines himself as a soul singer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mvremix.com/rock_blogs/2009/01/08/van-morrisons-astral-weeks-live-at-the-hollywood-bowl-chronicles-the-first-ever-live-performance-of-legendary-soul-singers-revered-1968-album/|publisher=mvremix.com|date=2009-01-08|title=Van Morrison's "Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl"|accessdate=2009-05-29}}</ref>

Some of Morrison's music has been classified in a genre of its own and referred to as "Celtic soul"<ref name = "Astral Weeks, Light"/> or what biographer Brian Hinton referred to as a new alchemy called "Caledonian soul."<ref name="HintonPage13">Hinton (1997), page 13.</ref> Another biographer, [[Ritchie Yorke]] quoted Morrison as believing that he has "the spirit of Caledonia in his soul and his music reflects it."<ref name="Yorke Page159">Yorke (1975), page 159.</ref>  According to Yorke, Morrison claimed to have discovered "a certain quality of soul" when he first visited Scotland (his Belfast ancestors were of [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]] descent) and Morrison has said he believes there is some connection between soul music and Caledonia. Yorke relates that Morrison "discovered several years after he first began composing music that some of his songs lent themselves to a unique major modal scale (without sevenths) which of course is the same scale as that used by [[bagpipes|bagpipe]] players and old Irish and Scottish folk music."<ref name="Yorke Page159">Yorke (1975), page 159.</ref>

==Caledonia==
The name "[[Caledonia]]" has played a prominent role in Morrison's life and career. Biographer [[Ritchie Yorke]] had pointed out already by 1975 that Morrison has referred to Caledonia so many times in his career that he "seems to be obsessed with the word."<ref name="Yorke Page159">Yorke (1975), page 159.</ref>  In his 2009 biography, [[Erik Hage]] found that "Morrison seemed deeply interested in his paternal Scottish roots during his early career, and later in the ancient countryside of England, hence his repeated use of the term ''Caledonia'' (an ancient Roman name for Scotland/northern Britain)."<ref>Hage (2009), page 52.</ref>  As well as being his daughter's middle name, it's the name of his first production company, his studio, his publishing company, two of his backing groups, and he also recorded a cover of the song, "Caldonia" (with the name spelled "Caledonia") in 1974.<ref name="Yorke Page159">Yorke (1975), page 159.</ref> Morrison used "Caledonia" in what has been called a quintessential Van Morrison moment in the song, "[[Listen to the Lion]]" with the lyrics, "And we sail, and we sail, way up to Caledonia".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2005/11/listening-to-old-voices-van-morrison.html|publisher=pastemagazine.com|author=Whitman, Andy|title=Listening to Old Voices: Van Morrison The Lion In Winter|date=2005-11-14|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref> As late as 2008, Morrison used "Caledonia" as a [[mantra]] in the live performance of the song, "[[Astral Weeks (song)|Astral Weeks]]" recorded at the two [[Hollywood Bowl]] concerts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-morrison9-2009jan09,0,5414358.story|title=Van Morrison takes listeners on his spiritual journey|publisher=latimes.com|date=2009-01-09|author=Lewis, Randy|accessdate=2009-01-22}}</ref>

==Influence==
Morrison's influence can readily be heard in the music of a diverse array of major artists and according to ''The Rolling Stone's Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll'' (Simon & Shuster, 2001), "his influence among rock singers/song writers is unrivaled by any living artist outside of that other prickly legend, [[Bob Dylan]]. Echoes of Morrison's rugged literateness and his gruff, feverish emotive vocals can be heard in latter day icons ranging from [[Bruce Springsteen]] to [[Elvis Costello]]".<ref name="Van Morrison Biography: Rolling Stone"/>  His influence includes [[U2]] (much of ''The Unforgettable Fire''); [[Bono]] ("I am in awe of a musician like Van Morrison. I had to stop listening to Van Morrison records about six months before we made ''The Unforgettable Fire'' because I didn't want his very original soul voice to overpower my own.");<ref>Bayles, Martha.

==Personal life==
Morrison lived in [[Belfast]] from birth until 1967, when he moved to [[New York City|New York]] after signing with [[Bang Records]].
