[[File:Ireland.A2003004.jpg|thumb|250px|True-colour satellite image of [[Ireland]], known in Irish as {{lang|ga|''<U+00C9>ire''}}.]]

{{lang|ga|'''<U+00C9>ire'''}} (pronounced {{IPA-audio|Eire.ogg|[<U+02C8>e<U+02D0><U+027E><U+02B2><U+0259>]}}) is the [[Irish language|Irish]] name for the island of [[Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland|sovereign state of the same name]].

== Etymology ==
{{See|<U+00C9>riu|Erin|Hibernia|Iverni}}
The modern Irish ''<U+00C9>ire'' evolved from the [[Old Irish]] word ''[[<U+00C9>riu]]'', which was the name of a [[Gaels|Gaelic]] goddess. ''<U+00C9>riu'' is generally believed to have been the matron goddess of Ireland, a goddess of sovereignty, or simply a goddess of the land. The origin of ''<U+00C9>riu'' has been traced to the [[Proto-Celtic]] reconstruction *''<U+03A6><U+012B>werjon'' (nominative singular ''<U+03A6><U+012B>werj<U+014D>'').<ref>[http://www.wales.ac.uk/documents/external/cawcs/pcl-moe.pdf Proto-Celtic<U+2014>English lexicon]{{dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> This suggests a descent from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] reconstruction *''piHwerjon'', likely related to the adjectival stem *''piHwer-'' (cf. [[Sanskrit]] ''p<U+012B>van'', ''p<U+012B>var<U+012B>'' and ''p<U+012B>vara'' meaning "fat, full, abounding"). This would suggest a meaning of "abundant land".

This Proto-Celtic form became ''<U+012A>weri<U+016B>'' or ''<U+012A>veri<U+016B>'' in [[Goidelic languages|Proto-Goidelic]].<ref>Mallory, J.P. and D.Q. Adams, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture.'' London: Fitzroy Dearborn Pub., 1997, p. 194</ref> It is highly likely that explorers borrowed and modified this term. During his exploration of northwest Europe (circa 320 BCE), [[Pytheas of Massilia]] called the island  ''Ierne'' (written {{polytonic|<U+1F38><U+03AD><U+03C1><U+03BD><U+03B7>}}). In his book ''Geographia'' (circa 150 CE), [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemaeus]] called the island  ''Iouernia'' (written {{polytonic|<U+1F38><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03BD><U+03AF><U+03B1>}}). Based on these historical accounts, the Roman Empire called the island ''[[Hibernia]]''.

Thus, the evolution of the word would follow as such:
*[[Proto-Celtic]]  *''<U+03A6><U+012B>werjon'' (nominative singular ''<U+03A6><U+012B>werj<U+014D>'')
**[[Goidelic languages|Proto-Goidelic]]  *''<U+012A>weri<U+016B>'' or *''<U+012A>veri<U+016B>''
***[[Old Irish]]  ''<U+00C9>riu''
****[[Irish language|Modern Irish]]  ''<U+00C9>ire''

=== Largely discredited etymologies ===
Other explanations for the [[etymology]] of ''<U+00C9>ire'' are: {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
* Derived from a root word ''Ara'' (also spelt ''Arya'', ''Aire'' or ''Aera'') meaning noble, as in '[[Aryan]]'. Among the very many poetic names for the island of Ireland was ''M<U+00E1>g Ealga'' meaning ''plain of the nobles''.
*''Ar'' or ''Ir'' in the Irish language also meant ''land'', and according to old manuscripts{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} was the name given to the lands of the [[mythology|mythological]] Celtic tribe of [[Go<U+00ED>del Glas]] who travelled from Scythia across Greece and eventually to Ireland.

=== Difference between ''<U+00C9>ire'' and ''Erin'' ===
While ''<U+00C9>ire'' is simply the name for Ireland in the Irish language, and sometimes used in [[English language|English]], ''Erin'' is a common poetic name for Ireland in English, as in ''[[Erin go bragh]]''. The distinction between the two is one of the difference between [[Grammatical case|cases]] of [[nouns]] in Irish. ''<U+00C9>ire'' is the [[nominative case]], the case that (in the modern Gaelic languages) is used for nouns that are the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of a sentence i.e. the noun that is ''doing'' something as well as the direct [[object (grammar)|object]] of a sentence. ''Erin'' derives from ''<U+00C9>irinn'' (pronounced {{IPA-audio|Eire.ogg|[<U+02C8>e<U+02D0><U+027E><U+02B2><U+026A><U+0272>]}}), the Irish [[dative case]] of ''<U+00C9>ire'', which has replaced the nominative case in D<U+00E9>ise Irish (and some non-standard sub-dialects elsewhere), in [[Scottish Gaelic]] (where the usual word for Ireland is {{lang|gd|''<U+00C8>irinn''}}) and Manx Gaelic, where the word is spelled Nerin, with the initial n- is probably in origin a fossilisation of the preposition ''in''/''an'' "in" (cf. Irish ''in <U+00C9>irinn'', Scottish ''an <U+00C8>irinn''/''ann an <U+00C8>irinn'' "in Ireland"). The [[genitive case]] ''<U+00C9>ireann'' is used in the Gaelic forms of the titles of companies and institutions in Ireland e.g. ''[[Iarnr<U+00F3>d <U+00C9>ireann]]'' (''Irish Rail''), ''[[D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann]]'' (''Irish Parliament'') or ''[[Poblacht na h<U+00C9>ireann]]'' (''The Republic of Ireland'').

Article 4 of the [[Bunreacht na h<U+00C9>ireann|Irish constitution]] adopted in 1937 provides that: "The name of the state is <U+00C9>ire, or, in the English language, ''Ireland''."<ref>"[http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/attached_files/html%20files/Constitution%20of%20Ireland%20(Eng)Nov2004.htm Bunreacht Na <U+00C9>ireann]". Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Retrieved on 14 March 2007</ref> The Constitution's English-language [[Irish Constitution#Preamble (full text)|preamble]] also described the population as "We, the people of <U+00C9>ire". The ''[[Republic of Ireland Act]]'' enacted in 1948 makes clear that the "Republic of Ireland" is a description and not a name of the state. Ireland (in English) and <U+00C9>ire (in Irish) remain its two official names. Article 8 states that both Irish and English are the official languages of the state with Irish designated as the "national" and "first official" language. "<U+00C9>ire" has to some extent passed out of everyday conversation and literature.

The name "<U+00C9>ire" has been used on Irish [[postage stamps of Ireland|postage stamps]] since 1922; on all [[Irish coinage]] (including [[Irish euro coins]]); and together with "Ireland" on passports and other official state documents issued since 1937. "<U+00C9>ire" is used on the [[Official Seal of the President of Ireland]]. Before the 1937 Constitution, "Saorst<U+00E1>t <U+00C9>ireann" (the Irish name of the [[Irish Free State]]) was generally used.

During the [[The Emergency (Ireland)|Emergency]] (as [[World War II]] was known), Irish ships had "EIRE" and the [[Flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]] painted large on their sides and deck, to identify them as neutrals.

From 1938 to 1962 the [[List of international license plate codes#I|international plate on Irish cars]] was marked "EIR", short for <U+00C9>ire, until statutory instrument no. 269 of 1961 allowed "IRL".<ref>SI 269 of 1961:"''...the letters EIR are used to indicate the name of the State but the letters IRL may be substituted therefor.''"</ref> In 1922-1938 it was "SE", and from 1962 "IRL" has been adopted. Irish politician Bernard Commons [[Teachta D<U+00E1>la|TD]] suggested to the [[D<U+00E1>il]] in 1950 that the government examine "''the tourist identification plate bearing the letters EIR''"  "''with a view to the adoption of identification letters more readily associated with this country by foreigners''".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0119/D.0119.195003220018.html |title=D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann - Volume 119 - 22 March, 1950 - Ceisteanna<U+2014>Questions. Oral Answers. - Motor Identification Letters |publisher=Historical-debates.oireachtas.ie |date=1950-03-22 |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref> "EIR" is also shown in other legislation such as the car insurance statutory instrument no. 383 of 1952 and no. 82 of 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1958/en/si/0082.html |title=SI 82 of 1958 text |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=1959-12-31 |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1952/en/si/0383.html#zzsi383y1952 |title=SI 383 of 1952 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref>

Under the [[Convention on International Civil Aviation|1947 Convention]] [[Aircraft registration#List of countries/regions and their current registration prefixes and patterns|Irish-registered aircraft]] have carried a registration mark starting "EI" for <U+00C9>ire.

From January 2007, the Irish government nameplates at meetings of the [[European Union]] have borne both ''<U+00C9>ire'' and ''Ireland'', following the adoption of [[Irish language|Irish]] as a [[Languages of the European Union|working language of the European Union]].

== Use of Eire in Britain ==
In 1938 the British government provided in the [[Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act 1938]] that British legislation could henceforth refer to the Irish Free State as "Eire" (but not as "<U+00C9>ire"). The 1938 Act was repealed in 1981, and in the meantime Eire became a rare but accepted spelling in [[British English]], but has now passed out of general use.

== Other uses ==
<U+00C9>ire has also been incorporated into the names of Irish commercial and social entities, such as "[[eircom|eircom plc]]" (formerly "Telecom <U+00C9>ireann") and its former mobile phone network, and [[Eircell]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eircom.ie/cgi-bin/bvsm/bveircom/mainPage.jsp |title=eircom homepage |publisher=Eircom.ie |date=2006-11-29 |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref> In 2006 the Irish electricity network was devolved to [[EirGrid]]. The company "BetEire Flow" ([[eFlow]]), named as a [[pun]] on "better", is a [[France|French]] consortium running the electronic tolling system at the [[West-Link]] bridge west of Dublin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nra.ie/News/PressReleases/htmltext,8987,en.html |title=National Roads Authority statement 2007 |publisher=Nra.ie |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref> According to the Dublin [[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|Companies Registration Office]] in 2008, over 500 company names incorporate the word <U+00C9>ire in some form.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cro.ie/search/ |title=CRO search page |publisher=Cro.ie |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref>

Sometimes the incorporation is humorous or ironic, such as the pop group named "Scary<U+00C9>ire",<ref>[http://www.mongrel.ie/april07pp12.php Comment on Scary<U+00C9>ire]</ref> or [[Cormac <U+00D3> Gr<U+00E1>da]]'s "<U+00C9>irvana" paper in 2007 on the [[Celtic Tiger]] economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/economics/research/papers/2008/WP08.12.pdf |title=Some recent social changes are not easily linked with the Tiger per se |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref>
