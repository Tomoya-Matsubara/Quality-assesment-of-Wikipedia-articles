'''Midrash Esfah''' ([[Hebrew]]: '''<U+05DE><U+05D3><U+05E8><U+05E9> <U+05D0><U+05E1><U+05E4><U+05D4>''') is one of the [[smaller midrashim]], which as yet is known only from a few excerpts in [[Yal<U+1E33>u<U+1E6D>]] and two citations in ''[[Sefer Raziel]]'' and ''[[Ha-Ro<U+1E33>ea<U+1E25>]]''. It receives its name from [[Num.]] xi. 16: "Gather unto me ["Esfah-li"] seventy men of the elders of Israel." 

In [[Yal<U+1E33>.]] i, <U+00A7> 736 is found a citation relating to the same verse, which cannot be traced to any other midrash, and is doubtless taken from Midrash Esfah. To this midrash may possibly be referred a passage in the ''Halakot Gedolot'' (ed. Warsaw, p. 282b) and a fragment on [[Num.]] xvii. 14, xx. 1-3, in Wertheimer, ''Batte Midrashot,'' iii. 8-10, which agrees in its concluding words with the excerpt in Yal<U+1E33>., Num. 763 on Num. xx. 3 (found also ib. 262, on [[Ex.]] xvii. 2, which begins with the same words). The name of the midrash shows that it must have begun with Num. xi. 16. The other excerpts in the [[Yal<U+1E33>u<U+1E6D>]] from the Midrash Esfah, <U+00A7><U+00A7> 737, 739, 742, 764, 773, and 845, are based on Num. xi. 24, xii. 3-7, xii. 12, xxi. 9, xxvi. 2 (found also ib. 684, on Num. i. 2, which begins with the same words), and [[Deut.]] vi. 16; the extent of the midrash, however, can not be determined.

The interesting extract in Yal<U+1E33>., Num. on Num. xi. 16 names the seventy elders in two of its recensions (a third recension of this passage is furnished by a [[Vatican library]] manuscript); and one of these versions concludes with a noteworthy statement which justifies the inference that the midrash was taught in the academy or [[<U+1E24>anina Gaon]] by [[Rabbi Samuel]], brother of [[Rabbi Phinehas]]. It would seem, therefore, that the midrash was composed in [[Babylon]] in the first half of the 9th century.
