{{nihongo title|Ico|<U+30A4><U+30B3>|Iko|{{pronEng|<U+02C8>i<U+02D0>ko<U+028A>}}<!--For those who think "ee-ko" should be "eye-ko"- everyone is entitled to pronounce words the way they like, but the pronunciation here has already been decided. Please see the discussion page.-->}} is a 2001 [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] published by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and released for the [[PlayStation 2]] video game console.  It was designed and directed by [[Fumito Ueda]], who wanted to create a minimalist game around a "boy meets girl" concept.  Originally planned for the [[PlayStation]], ''Ico'' took approximately four years to develop.  The team employed a "subtracting design" approach to reduce elements of gameplay that interfered with the game's setting and story in order to create a high level of [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]].

The titular protagonist is a young boy with horns whom his village  considers  a bad omen. Warriors lock Ico away in an abandoned fortress.  During his explorations of the fortress, Ico encounters Yorda, the daughter of the castle's Queen, who plans to use Yorda's body to extend her own lifespan.  Ico seeks to escape the castle with Yorda to prevent this fate from occurring, keeping her safe from the shadow-like creatures that attempt to draw her back.  Throughout the game, the player controls Ico as he explores the castle, solves puzzles, and assists the less-agile Yorda across obstacles.

''Ico'' introduced several design and technical elements, including a story told with minimal dialog, [[bloom (shader effect)|bloom lighting]] and [[key frame]] animation, that have influenced subsequent games.  Though not a commercial success, it was critically acclaimed for its art and story elements and received several awards, including "Game of the Year" nominations and three [[Game Developers Choice Awards]].  ''Ico'' is listed on several overall top game lists, and is often considered more  a work of art than  a video game.  The game was reprinted in [[Europe]] in 2006, in conjunction with the release of ''[[Shadow of the Colossus]]'', the [[spiritual successor]] to ''Ico''.

==Plot==
The game's main protagonist is {{nihongo|Ico|<U+30A4><U+30B3>|Iko}}, a young boy with a pair of horns on his head<U+2014>considered a bad omen by his village. As part of the village's tradition, he is taken by a group of warriors to a castle surrounded by water and locked inside one of the [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] in a crypt.<ref>{{cite video game | title = Ico | developer = [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] | publisher = [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] | date = 2001-09-24 | platform = [[PlayStation 2]] | quote = '''Ico''': They... they tried to sacrifice me because I have horns. Kids with horns are brought here.}}</ref>  Some time after the warriors depart, a tremor runs through the castle, and Ico is able to take advantage of it to escape his confines.  As he searches the castle, he comes across {{nihongo|Yorda|<U+30E8><U+30EB><U+30C0>|Yoruda}}, a captive girl who speaks in an unknown language.  Ico helps Yorda escape, but finds that she is hunted by shadow-like creatures (the souls of other horned children sacrificed to the fortress) that attempt to drag her body into the portals from which they emerged.  Though Ico cannot be harmed by the shadows and is able to drive them away from Yorda, he finds he cannot defeat the enemies with his simple weapons.  The pair make their way through the abandoned castle, eventually arriving at the bridge leading to land.  As they cross, the Queen,  ruler of the fortress and Yorda's mother, appears and tells Yorda that as her daughter she cannot leave the castle.<ref>{{cite video game | title = Ico | developer = [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] | publisher = [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] | date = 2001-09-24 | platform = [[PlayStation 2]] | quote = '''Queen:''' That girl you're with is my one and only beloved daughter. Stop wasting your time with her. She lives in a different world than some boy with horns! ... Yorda, why can't you understand?  You cannot survive in the outside world.}}</ref>  Ico and Yorda attempt to flee, but the Queen destroys part of the bridge in their path; although Yorda tries to save him, Ico falls off the bridge and loses consciousness.

Ico awakes in the chambers below the castle, and travels back to the upper levels.  During his explorations, he finds a magic sword that is able to dispel the shadow creatures.  After discovering that Yorda has been turned to stone by the Queen, he seeks out the Queen in her throne room.  The Queen reveals that she is preventing Yorda from leaving so that she may extend her own life, which she had previously done  by draining the life of those placed in the sarcophagi.  Now, she plans to restart her life anew by taking possession of Yorda's body.<ref>{{cite video game | title = Ico | developer = [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] | publisher = [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] | date = 2001-09-24 | platform = [[PlayStation 2]] | quote = '''Queen''': My body has become too old and won't last much longer.  But Yorda's going to grant me the power to be ressurrected.  To be my spiritual vessel is the fulfillment of her destiny.}}</ref>  Ico and the Queen fight, Ico losing both of his horns in the process. Ico is able to slay the Queen with the magic sword, but with her death the castle begins to collapse around him, and he loses consciousness again from falling debris.  The Queen's spell on Yorda is broken, and as a shadow creature Yorda carries Ico safely out of the castle and onto a boat, sending him to drift to the nearby shore and choosing not to accompany him.  Ico awakes to find the castle in ruins and Yorda, in her human form, washed up beside him.<ref name="method development"/>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Ico gameplay.jpg|thumb|right|Ico (right) calls out to Yorda (left) while she waits on the ruined castle.  The game's graphics feature a "soft lightning" technique that has influenced the graphics of future games.]]
''Ico'' is primarily a [[3D computer graphics|three dimensional]] [[platform game]].  The player controls Ico from a [[third-person perspective]] as he explores the castle and attempts to escape it with Yorda.<ref name="g4tv review"/>  The camera remains at a fixed point in each room or area but tracks Ico or Yorda as they move; the player can also [[Panning (camera)|pan]] the view a small degree in other directions to observe more of the surroundings.<ref name="method development"/>  The game includes many elements of platform games; for example, the player must have Ico jump, climb, push and pull objects, and perform other tasks such as solving puzzles,  to progress  within the castle.<ref name="gamespot review"/>  These actions are complicated by the fact that only Ico is able to carry out these actions; Yorda can only jump short distances and cannot climb over tall barriers.  The player must use Ico so that he helps Yorda cross obstacles, such as by lifting her to a higher ledge, or by arranging the environment to allow Yorda to cross a larger gap herself.  The player is able to tell Yorda to follow Ico, or to wait at a spot.  The player can also have Ico take Yorda's hand and pull her along at a faster pace across the environment.<ref name="eurogamer review"/>   Players are unable to progress in the game until they move Yorda to certain doors that only she is able to open.<ref name="g4tv review"/>

Escaping the castle is made difficult by shadow creatures sent by the Queen. These creatures attempt to drag Yorda into black vortexes if Ico leaves her for any a length of time, or if she is in certain areas of the castle.  Ico can dispel these shadows using a stick or sword and pull Yorda free if she is drawn into a vortex.<ref name="g4tv review"/>  While the shadow creatures cannot harm Ico, the game is over if Yorda becomes fully engulfed by a vortex; the player restarts from a [[Saved game#Saved states|save point]].  The player will also restart from a save point if Ico falls from a large height.  Save points in the game are represented by stone benches which Ico and Yorda rest on as the player saves the game.<ref name="eurogamer review"/>

==Development==
[[Image:Kaido Kenji And Fumito Ueda.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kenji Kaido]] and [[Fumito Ueda]], the creative team behind ''Ico'']]
Lead developer Fumito Ueda came up with the concept for ''Ico'' in 1997, envisioning a "boy meets girl" story where the two main characters would hold hands during their adventure, forming a bond between them without communication.<ref name="method development"/>  Ueda's main inspiration for ''Ico'' was [[Eric Chahi]]'s game ''[[Another World (video game)| Another World]]'' (''Outer World'' in Japan), which used [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cinematic cutscenes]] and lacked any [[head-up display]] elements as to play like a movie. It also featured a emotional connection between two characters, despite the use of minimal dialog.<ref name="ueda interview">{{cite web | url = http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/2007/04/03/103,1175597139,69535,0,0.html | title = 5 days straight! <U+3000>Hiroshi famous game creators say that!

Ueda began working with producer [[Kenji Kaido]] in 1998 to develop the idea and bring the game to the [[PlayStation]].<ref name="gamespy hardcore"/>  ''Ico''{{'}}s design aesthetics were guided by three key notions: to make a game that would be different from others in the genre, feature an aesthetic style that would be consistently artistic, and play out in an imaginary yet realistic setting.<ref name="method development"/>  This was achieved through the use of "subtracting design"; they removed elements from the game which interfered with the game's reality.<ref name="method development"/>  This included removing any form of interface elements, keeping the gameplay focused only on the escape from the castle, and reducing the number of types of enemies in the game to a single foe.  An interim design of the game shows Ico and Yorda facing horned warriors similar to those that take Ico to the castle. The game originally focused on Ico's attempt to return Yorda to her room in the castle after she was kidnapped by these warriors.<ref name="beta video"/>  Ueda believed this version had too much detail for the graphics engine they had developed, and as part of the "subtracting design", replaced the warriors with the shadow creatures.<ref name="method development"/>  Ueda also brought in a number of people outside the video game industry to help with development. These consisted of two programmers, four artists, and one designer in addition to Ueda and Kaido, forming the base of what is now known as [[Team ICO]].<ref name="gamespy hardcore"/><ref name="method development"/>  On reflection, Ueda noted that the subtracting design may have taken too much out of the game, and did not go to as great an extreme with ''Shadow of the Colossus''.<ref name="method development"/>

After two years of development, the team ran into limitations on the PlayStation hardware and faced a critical choice: either terminate the project altogether, alter their vision to fit the constraints of the hardware, or continue to explore more options.  The team decided to remain true to Ueda's vision, and began to use the [[Emotion Engine]] of the [[PlayStation 2]], taking advantage of the improved abilities of the platform.<ref name="game design ico">{{cite conference | title = Game Design Methods of Ico | first = Fumito | last = Ueda | coauthors = Kaido, Kenji | year = 2004 | booktitle = Game Developers Conference 2004 | date = 2004-03-24}}</ref><ref name="game design ico slides">{{cite web | url  =http://watch.impress.co.jp/game/docs/20040329/ico.htm | title = Game Developers Conference 2004 - report | publisher = Game Watch | language = Japanese | date = 2004-03-29 | accessdate = 2008-10-09 | first = Hitoshi | last = Yasushi}}</ref>    Character animation was accomplished through [[key frame]] animation instead of the more common [[motion capture]] technique.<ref name="nytimes review">{{cite web | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE3D8173EF93BA25753C1A9679C8B63 | title = Game Theory; When a Tiny Taut Gesture Upstages Demons and Noise | first = Charles | last = Herold | date = 2001-10-18 | accessdate = 2008-10-07 | publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}</ref>  ''Ico'' is recognized as one of the first games to incorporate [[bloom (shader effect)|bloom lighting]] into video games, a feature that is common in later [[seventh generation consoles|seventh generation console]] video games.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3144548 | title = Bittersweet Symphony | date = 2005-10-15 | accessdate = 2008-10-07 | first = James | last = Mielke | publisher = [[1UP.com|1UP]]}}</ref> The game took about four years to create.<ref name="method development"/>  Ueda purposely left the ending vague, not stating whether Yorda was alive, whether she would travel with Ico, or if it was simply the protagonist's dream.<ref name="method development"/>

The cover used for releases in Japan and [[PAL region]]s was drawn by Ueda himself, and was inspired by the [[surrealist]] artist [[Giorgio de Chirico]] and his work, ''[[The Nostalgia of the Infinite]]''. Ueda believed that "the surrealistic world of de Chirico matched the allegoric world of Ico".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=2&cId=3143702 | title = A Giant in the Making | publisher = [[1UP.com|1UP]] | date = 2005-09-23 | accessdate = 2008-10-05 | first = James | last = Mielke | coauthors = Rybicki, Joe}}</ref>  The North American version lacks this cover as well as additional features that become available after the player completes the game once.<ref name="gamespot cheats"/>  The development team was unable to provide Ueda's cover or the additional features in time for Sony's planned North American release date, but included them for the later releases in Japan and PAL regions.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3144673 | title = Shadow Talk | publisher = [[1UP.com|1UP]] | date = 2005-10-13 | accessdate = 2008-11-18 | first = James | Mielke }}</ref>  For its original release, a limited edition of the game was available in PAL regions that included a cardboard wrapping displaying artwork from the game and four art cards inside the box.<ref name="extrasandico">{{cite web | last =Wales | first = Matt | year=2006 | title=PAL Colossus gets exclusive content | url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=133500 | publisher= ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' | accessdate = 2008-10-08 }}</ref> The game was re-released as a standard edition in 2006 across all PAL regions except France after the 2005 release of ''Shadow of the Colossus'', ''Ico''{{'}} [[spiritual sequel]], to allow players to "fill the gap in their collection".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=61556 | title = ICO re-issue confirmed | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] | first = Kristen | last = Reed | date = 2005-11-04 | accessdate = 2008-10-05}}</ref>

Charles Herold of the ''[[New York Times]]'' summed up his review stating that "Ico is not a perfect game, but it is a game of perfect moments."<ref name="nytimes review"/>

The game is noted for its simple combat system that would "disappoint those craving sheer mechanical depth", as stated by [[Gamespot]]{{'}}s Miguel Lopez.<ref name="gamespot review">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/adventure/ico/review.html?tag=tabs;reviews | title = Ico for PlayStation 2 Review | first = Miguel | last = Lopez | publisher = [[Gamespot]] | date = 2001-09-26 | accessdate = 2008-10-07}}</ref>  The puzzle design, while considered easy and at times repetitive,<ref name="ign review"/> was found to have a structure that prompts players to work through the challenges themselves, instead of relying on [[walkthrough]]s.  Kristen Reed of [[Eurogamer]] said that "you quietly, logically, willingly proceed, and the illusion is perfect: the game never tells you what to do, even though the game is always telling you what to do".<ref name="eurogamer review">{{cite web | url =http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=62936 | title = Ico Review | date = 2006-02-17 | accessdate = 2008-10-07 | first = Kristen | last = Reed | publisher = [[Eurogamer]]}}</ref>  ''Ico'' is also considered a short game, taking between seven and ten hours for a single play through, but compounded by the fact, as noted by [[G4 (TV channel)|G4TV]]'s Matthew Keil, that "the urge to press on further into the breathtaking world of the game is so strong, many will finish 'Ico' in one or two sittings".<ref name="g4tv review">{{cite web | url = http://www.g4tv.com/techtvvault/features/33435/Ico_PS2_Review.html | title = 'Ico' (PS2) Review | publisher = [[G4TV]] | date = 2002-09-02 | accessdate = 2008-10-08 | first = Matthew | last = Keil }}</ref>  The lack of features in the North American release, which would become unlocked on subsequent playthroughs after completing the game, was said to reduce the replay value of the title.<ref name="g4tv review"/>

===Awards===
''Ico'' received several gaming acclamations from the video gaming press, and was considered to be one of the Games of the Year by many publications, although it was in competition with other best-selling 2001 releases, such as ''[[Halo (video game)|Halo]]'', ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', and ''[[Grand Theft Auto 3]]''.<ref name="ign top 100 2007"/>  The game received three [[Game Developers Choice Awards]] in 2002, including "Excellence in Level Design", "Excellence in Visual Arts", and "Game Innovation Spotlight".<ref>{{cite web | archivedate = 2005-03-10 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050310040732/http://www.igda.org/awards/pr_2002_0322.htm | url = http://www.igda.org/awards/pr_2002_0322.htm | title = Game Developers Choice Awards Recipients Named | publisher = [[International Game Developers Association]] | date = 2002-03-22 | accessdate = 2008-10-07}}</ref>  The game won several [[Interactive Achievement Awards]] from the [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences]] in 2002 including "Art Direction" and "Character or Story Development", and was nominated for awards of "Game of the Year", "Game Design", "Level Design" and "Sound Design".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.interactive.org/awards/annual_awards.asp?idAward=2002 | title = 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards | publisher = [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences]] | date 2002-02-25 | accessdate = 2008-11-15}}</ref>
