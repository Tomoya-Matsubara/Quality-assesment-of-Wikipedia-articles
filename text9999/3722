'''Carol Martha Browner''' (born December 16, 1955) is an [[United States|American]] lawyer, environmentalist, and businesswoman, who serves as director of the [[White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy]] in the [[Obama administration]]. Browner previously served as [[Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]] during the [[Clinton administration]]. 

Browner grew up in [[Florida]] and graduated from the [[University of Florida]] and the [[University of Florida College of Law]].  After working for the [[Florida House of Representatives]], she was employed by [[Citizen Action]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]  She became a legislative assistant for Senators [[Lawton Chiles]] and [[Al Gore]].  Browner then headed the [[Florida Department of Environmental Regulation]] from 1991 to 1993, where she turned it into one of the most active departments in the state government.

She was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the EPA, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency.  During her tenure, she reorganized the agency's enforcement structure and oversaw two new programs designed to create flexible partnerships with industry as an alternative to traditional regulation.  She started a successful program to deal with contaminated lands in urban areas.  She took the lead within the administration in defending existing environmental laws and budgets, and was the driving force behind a stringent tightening of air quality standards that led to a prolonged political and legal battle.  Afterward, Browner became a founding member of the [[Albright Group]] and [[Albright Capital Management]] during the 2000s.  She also served on a number of boards of directors and committees dealing with environmental issues. She assumed her new post in the Obama administration in January 2009.

=== First four years ===
[[Image:Carol Browner EPA.gif|thumb|right|upright|Carol Browner as EPA Administrator]]
At the EPA, Browner supervised some 17,000&nbsp;employees and a $7&nbsp;billion budget.<ref name="usaw052193"/>  Early in her administration, she angered some EPA employees by publicly stating that the organization lacked management accountability and discipline and was wasting taxpayer money.<ref name="cby-78"/>  Soon after taking office, Browner and her top aides, including assistant administrator for enforcement [[Steve Herman (EPA)|Steven Herman]], reorganized several awkward and inefficient agency enforcement structures into a single [[Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance]].<ref name="mintz-132"/>  The EPA's regional offices were permitted flexibility in reworking their own enforcement structures, however, which led to some bureaucratic conflicts.<ref name="mintz-133">Mintz, ''Enforcement at the EPA'', p. 133.</ref>

Browner found criticism from both sides of environmental issues<ref name="usaw052193"/> and battled many environmentalists, who objected to her support for repeal of the 1958 [[Delaney clause]] regarding permissible levels of carcinogens in foods.<ref name="cby-78"/>  Her announcement in May 1993 that the EPA would impose a moratorium on new incinerator and industrial furnace licensing drew support from environmentalists, however.<ref name="cby-78"/> A move by Clinton to elevate the EPA and Browner to Cabinet-level status failed in late 1993 to gain sufficient Congressional support.<ref name="sfss112008"/><ref>{{cite news | title=House Leaders Defer Vote On Cabinet Rank for EPA;GOP Opposition to Clinton Measure Growing | author=Lee, Gary | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=November 20, 1993}}</ref>  Many of her legislative desires had to take a back seat to the higher-priority [[1993 Clinton health care plan]].<ref name="usaw052193"/>

When the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] took control of Congress after the [[United States elections, 1994|1994 U.S. elections]], Browner took the lead for the Clinton administration in successfully fighting efforts by the Republicans, especially in the House of Representatives, to amend the [[Clean Water Act]]<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_28aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5i0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7060,6364374&dq=carol+browner+republicans+clean-water-act&hl=en | title=EPA notes clean water's economic value | author=Behm, Don | newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] | date=June 4, 1996 | page=4A}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/indepth_coverage/white_house/transition2008/browner_profile.html | title=Browner Named as Newly-created Climate Policy Chief | work=[[PBS NewsHour|NewsHour]] | publisher=[[PBS]] | date=December 15, 2008}}</ref> and to rollback other environmental regulations.<ref name="turque-334">Turque, ''Inventing Al Gore'', p. 334.</ref>  She was able to work in a bipartisan manner, though, with Republicans in helping craft amendments to the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] and passage of the [[Food Quality Protection Act]].<ref name="npr-webc"/>  During the budget-cutting negotiations surrounding the [[United States federal government shutdown of 1995|federal government shutdown in 1995]], Browner successfully protected the EPA's review and enforcement powers and managed to gain over $750&nbsp;million in increased spending for the agency.<ref name="nyt070597">{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/05/us/on-clean-air-environmental-chief-fought-doggedly-and-won.html | title=On Clean Air, Environmental Chief Fought Doggedly, and Won | author=Cushman Jr., John H. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 5, 1997}}</ref>  Her bureaucratic effectiveness illustrated what one of her top aides characterized as her talent: "an extreme focus on a single issue where she is completely certain that she is right."<ref name="nyt070597"/>

Two initiatives begun by the Clinton administration under Browner's tenure were part of its [[National Partnership for Reinventing Government|"reinventing government" program]] and sought to realize the notion of [[environmental contract]]s as a way of expanding the EPA's flexible public-private partnerships, as an alternative to traditional regulation.<ref name="hazard-orts"/> Project XL in 1995 was designed to find common sense, cost effective solutions to environmental issues at individual facilities,<ref name="hazard-orts">Hazard Jr., Geoffrey C. and Orts, Eric W., "Environmental Contracts in the United States", in Orts and Deketelaere (eds.), ''Environmental Contracts'', pp. 71<U+2013>92.</ref> while the Common Sense Initiative in 1994 was targeted at efforts involving entire industry sectors, rather than dealing with issues on a crisis-by-crisis, pollutant-by-pollutant basis.<ref name="collin-163">Collin, ''The Environmental Protection Agency'', pp. 163<U+2013>165.</ref>  Project XL had mixed results, with some success stories but an uncertain legal basis regarding enforcement and less active participation than envisioned.<ref name="hazard-orts"/>  The more ambitious Common Sense Initiative, which somewhat resembled the environmental covenants appearing in some European countries and also incorporated the viewpoints of [[environmental justice]], showed limitations in some areas but successes in the [[printing]] and [[plating|metal finishing and plating]] industries before being concluded in 1998.<ref name="hazard-orts"/><ref name="collin-163"/>

In March 1995, Browner and the EPA were charged by the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|House Government Reform and Oversight]] Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs with violating the federal Anti-Lobbying Act ([[Title 18 of the United States Code|18 U.S. Code]] [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00001913----000-.html <U+00A7> 1913]) by faxing unsolicited material opposing the Republican-sponsored regulatory reform package to various corporations and public-interest groups.<ref>{{cite news | author=Price, Joyce. | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WT&p_theme=wt&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB0F139B22F1AC9&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | title=EPA broke law, panel charges: Bipartisan letter cites 'prohibited grass-roots lobbying' | newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] | date= March 22, 1995 | page= A3}} Accessed September 17, 2008 [http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/srd97d00 via the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library] at the [[University of California, San Francisco]].</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/04/us/epa-chief-is-accused-of-lobbying.html | title=E.P.A.

As EPA administrator, Browner started the agency's successful Brownfields Program in 1995.<ref name="collin-114">Collin, ''The Environmental Protection Agency'', pp. 114<U+2013>115.</ref> The program helped facilitate cleanups of [[brownfield land]]s and their contaminated facilities, especially in urban areas, by empowering states, communities, and assorted stakeholders in economic development.<ref name="collin-114"/>  It leveraged more than $1&nbsp;billion in public and private funds for cleanups and created thousands of new jobs, while enabling hundreds of communities to bring idle properties back into productive use.<ref name="npr-webc">{{cite news | url=http://www.npr.org/programs/npc/2000/001003.cbrowner.html | title=Carol Browner | publisher=[[NPR]] | date=October 3, 2000}}</ref>

=== Second four years ===
Perhaps Browner's biggest triumph<ref name="nyt-czar-ts"/> came in 1997, when she convinced Clinton to support a stringent tightening of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]'s [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] regarding permissible levels of the [[Tropospheric ozone|ground-level ozone]] that makes up [[smog]] and the fine airborne [[particulate matter]] that makes up [[soot]].<ref name="nyt062697">{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/26/us/clinton-sharply-tightens-air-pollution-regulations-despite-concern-over-costs.html | title=Clinton Sharply Tightens Air Pollution Regulations Despite Concern Over Costs | author=Cushman Jr., John H. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 26, 1997}}</ref><ref name="cnn110700">{{cite news | url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LAW/11/07/scotus.cleanair.02/index.html | title=U.S. Supreme Court hears clean air cases regarding smog and soot standards | author=Chebium, Raju | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=November 7, 2000}}</ref>   The decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade.<ref name="nyt062597">{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/25/us/d-amato-vows-to-fight-for-epa-s-tightened-air-standards.html | title=D'Amato Vows to Fight for E.P.A.'s Tightened Air Standards | author=Cushman Jr., John H. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 25, 1997}}</ref>  There was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration, with opposition from the president's economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said the costs of the new standards would far outweigh any benefits<ref name="nyt062697"/> and that Browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the EPA's scientific reviews on the matter.<ref name="nyt070597"/><ref name="time-queen"/>  Over eighty environmental and health groups, who had grown quite frustrated with the administration's preference for minimal-cost incremental actions in the area, pressured Vice President Gore to take a stand on the matter, but he remained silent.<ref name="turque-334"/>  Browner's adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost single-handedly, in private meetings, Congressional testimony, and public debate,<ref name="nyt070597"/> and had come in the face of a silence from the White House that had put at risk her standing within the administration.<ref name="nyt060197">{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/01/us/top-epa-official-not-backing-down-on-air-standards.html | title=Top E.P.A.
