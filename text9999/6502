The [[U.S. state]] of '''[[New Jersey]]''' first issued '''[[Vehicle registration plate|license plates]]''' in 1908.

All bases of all classes of plates from 1959 to present are still valid for display in New Jersey. Since 2004, passenger plates have been revalidated with the windshield stickers.

==Passenger baseplates 1959 to present==
Passenger plates were issued in pairs 1908 to present except for 1944, 1945, and 1946. New plates were issued every year until 1943 due to wartime restrictions. From 1943 until 1952 plates were issued yearly. Between 1953 to 1956 metal tabs were issued for revalidation of plates. In 1956 revalidation began with front windshield stickers, something that continues today. In 1999 the state tried revalidating plates with stickers in addition to the windshield sticker validation, but that scheme ended in 2004 with stickers issued to expire in 2005. Since then passenger plates have been revalidated with just the windshield sticker.

==Courtesy plates==
[[Image:New Jersey SVM 2.jpg|thumb|right|New Jersey Courtesy License Plate]]Courtesy Plates are issued to individuals with political connections. The plates are in an ABC 1/ABC 12 or 1 ABC/12 ABC format and range from 1 to 20. Courtesy plates may also be personalized with the owners 3 initials appearing before the number of 20 or less.  If not personalized, then the individual is issues a standard Courtesy Plate, where he first letter is a county code, the second letter is the first initial of the vehicle owner's name, and the second letter is the initial of the last name of the vehicle owner.

Courtesy plates must be approved by a [[New Jersey Senate|State Senator]] from the county that corresponds to the first letter on the plate being requested. Plates starting with the letter T can be approved by any senator, while those starting with D, O, Q or X are not available.<ref>Cichowski, John.
