{{nihongo|'''Enbetsu'''|<U+9060><U+5225><U+753A>|Enbetsu-ch<U+014D>}}, also known as '''Embetsu''', is a [[towns of Japan|town]] located in [[Teshio District, Hokkaid<U+014D>|Teshio District]], [[Rumoi Subprefecture|Rumoi]], [[Hokkaid<U+014D> Prefecture|Hokkaid<U+014D>]], [[Japan]]. As of 2013, the town had an estimated [[population]] of 2,966 and a [[population density|density]] of 5 persons per km<U+00B2>.<ref name="pop"/> The total area is {{convert|590.86|km2|mi2}}. The town is bisected by the [[Enbetsu River]], which flows from the [[Teshio Mountains]] directly into the [[Sea of Japan]].<ref name="n"/><ref name="c"/> Enbetsu is the northernmost area of rice production in Japan.<ref name="n"/><ref name="c"/><ref name="doro"/><ref name="suito"/>

==Etymology==

The name of the town of Enbetsu has its origin in the [[Ainu language]]. Three possibilities exist: Wen-pet, meaning "bad river"; "We-bet", meaning "forked river"; or "E-ye-pet", meaning "meeting place river", as Enbetsu was a meeting place of the seaside [[Ainu people|Ainu]] and the Ainu of the Teshio Mountains.<ref name="ainu"/>

==Geography==
[[File:Asahi spa gaikan 2011.JPG|thumb|left|Asahi Spa, Kotoura]]
Enbetsu is located at the north-northwest of the island of Hokkaido and overlooks the [[Japan Sea]]. The town occupies the [[drainage basin]] of the [[Enbetsu River]] from its origin on the western slopes of the [[Teshio Mountains]] to its mouth at the Sea of Japan. The west of the town is forested and sparsely inhabited. The small commercial and residential center of the town is located at the mouth of the river on the Japan Sea. Enbetsu is home to a ''[[onsen]]'' hot spring resort, the Asahi Spa in Kotoura. A small [[mud volcano]] is located in the marshes immediately vicinity of the hot spring.<ref name="doro"/>

===Rivers===

The Enbetsu River ({{Convert|62.5|km|mi}}) flows from its source in the Teshio Mountains on the border of Enbetsu and Horokanai, north-northwest through the town and into the Sea of Japan. The city center and town hall are all located at the mouth of the Enbetsu. Major tributaries of the Enbetsu include the Takinosawa, Kumanosawa, Nupuripaomanai, Nupurikeshiomappu, and Rubeshube rivers. Nearly {{Convert|20|km|mi}} of the Enbetsu is used for rice [[paddy]] agriculture. The rice paddies of the Enbetsu make up the northernmost border of the wide belt of rice production in Japan; the town is therefore known as the northernmost area of rice production in the country. A stone monument to the history of rice production in Japan was constructed in Enbetsu in 1957.<ref name="c"/><ref name="n"/><ref name="river-c"/><ref name="doro"/>

===Mountains===

[[Mount Pisshiri]] ({{Convert|1031.5|m|ft}}), the highest point in Enbetsu, is located to the very south of the town on its border with the towns Haboro and Horokanai. Pisshiri is the highest peak in the Teshio Mountains, and is also the source of the Enbetsu River.<ref name="teshio"/>

===Neighboring municipalities===

Enbetsu borders on five municipalities in Hokkaido Prefecture, three in Rumoi Subprefecture and two in [[Kamikawa Subprefecture]]:

*Rumoi Subprefecture
**[[Teshio, Hokkaido|Teshio]]
**[[Haboro, Hokkaido|Haboro]]
**[[Shosanbetsu, Hokkaido|Shosanbetsu]]
*Kamikawa Subprefecture
**[[Nakagawa, Hokkaido|Nakagawa]]
**[[Horokanai, Hokkaido|Horokanai]]<ref name="c"/>

==Climate==

Teshio is noted for its harsh climate. It has numerous days of rain, few days of sunlight, and strong winds. Temperatures vary widely. The highest recorded temperature in Enbetsu was {{convert|34.2|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} in 1979, and the lowest was {{convert|-26.8|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} in 2000.

==History==

The first recorded Japanese settler of Enbetsu was Gentar<U+014D> Shirahata, who moved to Enbetsu in 1896. A group of settlers from [[Echizen, Fukui|Echizen]], [[Fukui Prefecture]] called the Echizen Dantai came to Enbetsu in the following year. Groups from [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], and [[Kumamoto Prefecture|Kumamoto]] followed, as well as individual settlers. Enbetsu, which had previously been part of Teshio, was established as a separate village in 1909. Rice production was tested as early as 1897, specifically with strains of rice from Fukui Prefecture. After testing numerous strains from other parts of [[Honshu]], 1921 saw a successful rice crop in Enbetsu, and the start of an agricultural industry in the village.<ref name="c"/><ref name="echizen"/><ref name="suito"/>

Enbetsu was elevated to town status in 1949. The town grew to a population of 8,944 in 1958, and has entered into a  period of sustained depopulation. Both the agriculture and fishing industries of Enbetsu have fallen into decline, notably with the decline of the [[Pacific herring]] catch. Younger people from Enbetsu have migrated to work in larger cities in Hokkaido and Honshu, contributing to the depopulation of the town.<ref name="c"/><ref name="echizen"/><ref name="suito"/>

==Economy==

The primary agricultural product of Enbetsu is rice, specifically of glutinous rice for the preparation of ''[[mochi]]''. [[Asparagus]] and [[melon]]s are also grown in the town. The local economy also depends on dairy farming and fishing. Enbetsu is a source of [[flounder]] and [[Patinopecten yessoensis|Yesso scallops]].<ref name="n"/>
