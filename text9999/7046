The '''Sheyenne River''' is one of the major tributaries of the [[Red River of the North]], beginning about 29 miles north of [[McClusky, North Dakota]] and meanders eastward before turning south near [[McVille, North Dakota]].   

The southerly flow of the river continues through [[Griggs County, North Dakota]] and [[Barnes County, North Dakota]] before it turns in a northeastward direction near [[Lisbon, North Dakota]].  The river forms Lake Astabula behind the Baldhill Dam north of [[Valley City, North Dakota]].  

From Lisbon, the river crosses the Sheyenne National Grassland, and enters [[Cass County, North Dakota]] near the city of [[Kindred, North Dakota]].   This stretch is designated a [[National Wild and Scenic River]] and is popular with canoeists and outdoor enthusiasts.   From Kindred, the river flows north-northeastward through the fertile plains of the [[Red River Valley]] of the North.

The character of the river changes as it leaves the sandy grasslands and picks up the fertile clay soil of the Red River Valley.   Previously, the river posed a flooding hazard to cities such as [[West Fargo, North Dakota]] and [[Harwood, North Dakota]],<U+3000>where it joins the [[Red River of the North]] and flows north to [[Lake Winnipeg]] in [[Manitoba]] Province of [[Canada]].   However, due to a diversion canal completed near [[Horace, North Dakota]], the major Sheyenne River cities fared well in the [[Red River Flood, 1997]], which devastated the cities of [[Grand Forks, North Dakota]] and [[East Grand Forks, Minnesota]].
