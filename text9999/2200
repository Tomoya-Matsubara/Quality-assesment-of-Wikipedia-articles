"'''All the Lovers'''" is a song by Australian recording artist [[Kylie Minogue]]. It is the first single from her upcoming eleventh studio album, ''[[Aphrodite (album)|Aphrodite]]''. "All the Lovers" was written by English electropop duo [[Kish Mauve]] and was one of the last songs to be recorded for the album. Minogue chose the song as the first single since she felturc it was reflective of the euphoric mood of ''Aphrodite''. "All the Lovers" is a midtempo electropop song with prominent synthesizers, that has been compared to Minogue's 2004 single "[[I Believe in You (Kylie Minogue song)|I Believe in You]]". Its lyrics are an invitation to the dancefloor, while comparing previous relationships to one's current lover. "All the Lovers" was positively received by contemporary critics, who praised its dance anthem nature and deemed it as a classic Minogue single. 

The song has reached the top twenty in Australia, Belgium, Japan and Russia, and peaking inside the top ten in countries such as Ireland, Italy, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. The accompanying music video was inspired by the installations of [[Spencer Tunick]], and portrays Minogue on top of a [[flash mob]] of people wearing white underwear, surrounded by different white floating objects. Minogue explained that the video was an expression of her view on sexuality and sensuality. It received positive reviews, with critics complimenting its aesthetic and imagery. "All the Lovers" has been performed by Minogue in a number of live appearances, including the [[Germany's Next Topmodel, Cycle 5|fifth's season]] finale of ''[[Germany's Next Topmodel]]''.

===Development and synopsis===
The music video for "All the Lovers" was filmed on May 8 and May 9, 2010 in downtown [[Los Angeles, California]]. It was directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], who was reportedly chosen by Minogue since he could give the video a fresh, new feel.<ref name=dm>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1275665/Kylie-Minogue-surrounded-half-naked-extras-All-The-Lovers-music-video.html?ito=feeds-newsxml|title=Kylie Minogue surrounded by half-naked extras for All The Lovers music video | Mail Online|date=2010-05-10|accessdate=2010-06-02|last=Bull|first=Sarah|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Daily Mail and General Trust]]}}</ref> The concept is a re-imagination of works by American artist [[Spencer Tunick]], known for his installations that feature large numbers of nude people.

<blockquote>
"People go nuts over it, so that<U+2019>s amazing. [Kahn] came up with a brilliant, simple idea and executed it so sensitively, I thought.

===Reception===
Leah Greenblatt of ''Entertainment Weekly'' called it "a striptease-in-the-streets party of epic (and epically horny) proportions" and added, "the result is best described as either a makeout flash mob, a [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] gone wild, or some serious 'the touch, the feel of cotton' guerrilla marketing."<ref name=ewmv/> Kurt B.
