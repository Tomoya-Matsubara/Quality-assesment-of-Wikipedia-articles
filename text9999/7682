'''''United States v. Wong Kim Ark''''', {{ussc|169|649|1898}}, was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision that set an important legal [[Stare decisis|precedent]] about the role of ''[[jus soli]]'' (birth in the United States) as a factor in determining a person's claim to [[Citizenship in the United States|United States citizenship]].  The citizenship status of a man born in the United States to Chinese parents was challenged<ref name=Wong_not_US_citizen /> because of a law restricting Chinese immigration and prohibiting immigrants from China from becoming [[naturalized]] U.S. citizens,<ref name=Chinese_Exclusion_Act /> but the Supreme Court ruled that the citizenship language in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution]] could not be limited in its effect by an act of Congress.<ref name=cannot_control_or_impair />

Wong Kim Ark<ref>English transcriptions of the names of Chinese immigrants to the United States were often inconsistent.  Although most documents about Wong Kim Ark write his name as "Wong Kim Ark"<U+2014>and this is the spelling Wong himself used<U+2014>he is also referred to in various documents as "Wong Kim Ock" or "Wong Gin Ock".  Some discrepancies also exist in the way his sons' names were written in English.</ref> (<U+9EC3><U+91D1><U+5FB7>; [[Toisanese]]: wong11 gim33 'ak3; [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]]: wong4 gam1 dak1; [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]: hu<U+00E1>ng j<U+012B>n d<U+00E9>) was born in [[San Francisco, California]], sometime between 1868 and 1873.<ref>There are discrepancies regarding Wong Kim Ark's birthdate. Although the court documents regarding his claim to U.S. citizenship say he was born in 1873, an affidavit signed by Wong in November 1894 (before his fateful trip to China) said he was 23. In testimony given at a 1910 immigration hearing for his eldest son (Wong Yoke Fun), Wong Kim Ark gave his birthdate as "[[Tongzhi Emperor|T.C.]] 10, 9th month, 7th day" (a [[Chinese calendar|Chinese imperial calendar]] date said in the transcript of the testimony to correspond to October 20, 1871). In a 1931 immigration document, however, Wong said his birthdate was a year earlier ("T.C.9-9-7"; October 1, 1870). In testimony at immigration hearings for his second son (Wong Yook Sue) and his third son (Wong Yook Thue), he said he was 56 (in March 1925) and 57 (in July 1926), respectively; these last statements would suggest that Wong believed he had been born in 1868.</ref> His father, Wong Si Ping and his mother, Wee Lee<ref>Wong Kim Ark's parents are named in the 1895 [[habeas corpus]] petition filed in his behalf after his claim to U.S. citizenship was initially rejected.

In 1890 Wong's parents returned to live in [[China]]. Later that year Wong himself traveled to China and, when he returned to the U.S., authorities granted him entry "upon the sole ground that he was a native-born citizen of the United States."<ref name="McClain">{{cite book | first=Emlin | last=McClain | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SWtDAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA965&lpg=PA965 | title=A Selection of Cases on Constitutional Law | publisher=Little, Brown & Co | year=1900 | page=965 }}</ref> Four years later, Wong, who was employed in San Francisco as a cook,<ref>[http://www.sfweekly.com/1998-11-04/news/the-progeny-of-citizen-wong/ "The Progeny of Citizen Wong"], ''SF Weekly,'' November 4, 1998 <U+2014> an article about a great-granddaughter of Wong Kim Ark (a granddaughter of his son Wong Yook Jim).</ref> sailed to China on another temporary visit in 1894.

In 1882, the [[Congress of the United States]] had enacted the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]], limiting entry into the United States of persons of the Chinese [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]. Chinese immigrants already in the U.S. were allowed to stay, but they were ineligible for naturalization, and if they left the U.S., they needed to obtain approval all over again if they subsequently wished to return.  Chinese laborers and miners were specifically barred from coming (or returning) to the U.S. under the terms of the law.<ref name=Chinese_Exclusion_Act>[http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=old&doc=47 Chinese Exclusion Act (1882)], [http://www.ourdocuments.gov ourdocuments.gov].</ref>  However, the "[[Citizenship Clause|citizenship clause]]" of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1868 after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], states the following concerning citizenship: ''All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.''<ref>{{cite book | first=Frederic Jesup | last=Stimson | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=veDMy4aUwIgC&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76 | title=The Law of the Federal and State Constitutions of the United States | publisher=The Lawbook Exchange | year=2004 | page=77 }}</ref>  A federal district court sided with Wong, declared him to be a citizen,<ref>{{cite court | litigants=In re Wong Kim Ark | vol=71 | reporter=Fed. | opinion=382 | date=1896 | court=N.D.Cal. | url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F1/0071/0071.f1.0382.pdf | quote="From the law as announced and the facts as stipulated, I am of opinion [sic] that Wong Kim Ark is a citizen of the United States within the meaning of the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment.

The Supreme Court considered the key question in Wong Kim Ark's case to be "whether a child born in the United States, of parents of Chinese descent, who, at the time of his birth, are subjects of the Emperor of China, but have a permanent domicil and residence in the United States, and are there carrying on business, and are not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China, becomes at the time of his birth a citizen of the United States"<ref>{{cite court | url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0169_0649_ZS.html | litigants=U.S. v.

== Opinion of the Court ==
In a 6<U+2013>2 decision, the Supreme Court held that Wong Kim Ark had indeed acquired U.S. citizenship at birth and that "the American citizenship which Wong Kim Ark acquired by birth within the United States has not been lost or taken away by anything happening since his birth."<ref>{{cite journal | title=Judicial Decisions Involving Questions of International Law | journal=The American Journal of International Law | volume=8 | page=672 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WiUt6sBu_6YC&pg=PA672&lpg=PA672 }}</ref>

The 14th Amendment's citizenship clause, according to the court's majority, had to be interpreted in light of [[English common law]],<ref>{{cite court | url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0169_0649_ZS.html | litigants=U.S. v.

The opinion emphasized the fact that "during all the time of their said residence in the United States, as domiciled residents therein, the said mother and father of said Wong Kim Ark were engaged in the prosecution of business, and were never engaged in any diplomatic or official capacity under the emperor of China".<ref>{{cite court | url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0169_0649_ZS.html | litigants=U.S. v.

Since Wong was a U.S. citizen from birth, the restrictions of the Chinese Exclusion Act did not apply to him. An act of Congress, the majority held, does not trump the Constitution; such a law "cannot control [the Constitution's] meaning, or impair its effect, but must be construed and executed in subordination to its provisions."<ref name=cannot_control_or_impair>{{cite court | url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0169_0649_ZS.html | litigants=U.S. v.

=== Dissent ===
Chief Justice [[Melville Fuller]] was joined by Justice [[John Marshall Harlan|John Harlan]] in a dissenting opinion which was "elaborately drawn and, for the most part, may be said to be predicated upon the recognition of the international law doctrine".<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_kgZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA561&lpg=PA561 | first=Marshall B. | last=Woodworth | journal=American Law Review | volume=32 | page=561 | title=Who Are Citizens of the United States? Wong Kim Ark Case | publisher=Review Pub. Co. | date=1898 }}</ref>  Fuller argued that the history of U.S. citizenship law had broken with English common law tradition after [[American Revolutionary War|independence]]<U+2014>citing as an example the embracing in the U.S. of the right of expatriation (giving up of one's native citizenship) and the rejection of the contrary British doctrine of [[History of British nationality law#Early English and British nationality law|perpetual allegiance]].<ref>{{cite court | url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0169_0649_ZD.html | litigants=U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark | vol=169 | reporter=U.S. | opinion=649 | date=1898 | pinpoint=p. 713 }}</ref>  The minority argued that the principle of ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' (that is, the concept of a child inheriting his or her father's citizenship by descent regardless of birthplace) had been more pervasive in U.S. legal history since independence.<ref>{{cite court | url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0169_0649_ZD.html | litigants=U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark | vol=169 | reporter=U.S. | opinion=649 | date=1898 | pinpoint=p. 709 }}</ref>

Pointing to the language of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], which declared to be citizens "all persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed", and which was enacted into law only two months before the 14th Amendment was proposed by Congress, the minority argued that "it is not open to reasonable doubt that the words 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof,' in the amendment, were used as synonymous with the words 'and not subject to any foreign power{{'"}}.<ref>{{cite court | url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0169_0649_ZD.html | litigants=U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark | vol=169 | reporter=U.S. | opinion=649 | date=1898 | pinpoint=p. 721}}</ref>  They thus reasoned that the majority opinion exactly contradicted the original intended meaning of the 14th Amendment.

In the view of the minority, excessive reliance on ''[[jus soli]]'' (birthplace) as the principal determiner of citizenship would lead to an untenable state of affairs in which "the children of foreigners, happening to be born to them while passing through the country, whether of royal parentage or not, or whether of the [[Mongoloid|Mongolian]], [[Malay people|Malay]] or other race, were eligible to the [[President of the United States|presidency]], while children of our citizens, born abroad, were not".<ref>{{cite court | url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0169_0649_ZD.html | litigants=U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark | vol=169 | reporter=U.S. | opinion=649 | date=1898 | pinpoint=p. 715}}</ref>

The dissenters acknowledged that other children of foreigners<U+2014>including former [[History of slavery in the United States|slaves]]<U+2014>had, through the years, acquired U.S. citizenship through birth on U.S. soil. But they still saw a difference between those people and U.S.-born individuals of Chinese ancestry, because of (1) strong cultural traditions discouraging Chinese immigrants from assimilating into mainstream American society,<ref>{{cite court | url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0169_0649_ZD.html | litigants=U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark | vol=169 | reporter=U.S. | opinion=649 | date=1898 | pinpoint=p. 731 }}</ref> (2) Chinese laws of the time which made acquiring a new citizenship or renouncing allegiance to the Chinese emperor a [[Capital punishment|capital crime]],<ref>{{cite court | url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0169_0649_ZD.html#169_US_649ast2 | litigants=U.S. v.

As a result of Wong Kim Ark's U.S. citizenship being confirmed by the Supreme Court, three of his four sons were subsequently recognized as U.S. citizens and allowed to come to the United States:  '''Wong Yook Sue''' (<U+9EC3><U+90C1><U+8CDC>, Toisanese: wong11 yuk3 ti33, Cantonese: wong4 yuk1 tsi3); '''Wong Yook Thue''' (<U+9EC3><U+6C83><U+4FEE>, Toisanese: wong11 yuk3 sliu33, Cantonese: wong4 yuk1 sau1); and '''Wong Yook Jim''' (<U+9EC3><U+6C83><U+6CBE>, Toisanese: wong11 yuk3 zim33, Cantonese: wong4 yuk1 zim1).  A fourth son<U+2014>his eldest, '''Wong Yoke Fun''' (<U+9EC3><U+6BD3><U+7165>, Toisanese: wong11 yuk3 von22, Cantonese: wong4 yuk1 wun6)<U+2014>was rejected by U.S. officials, who claimed to see discrepancies in the testimony at his immigration hearing and refused to accept Wong Kim Ark's claim that the boy was his son.<ref> The immigration files for three of Wong Kim Ark's four sons are available for public viewing at the Pacific Region office of the U.S. [http://www.nara.gov National Archives and Records Administration] in [[San Bruno, California]]. A copy of Wong Kim Ark's immigration file can also be seen at the same office (the original file is locked away for safekeeping). As of late 2005, the immigration file for Wong Yook Sue was not available for viewing at the San Bruno National Archives office, but could potentially be seen by filing a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request with the [[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]].</ref>

Before ''Wong Kim Ark,'' the Supreme Court had held in ''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]'', {{ussc|112|94|1884}} <U+2014> a case involving an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] <U+2014> that birthplace by itself was not sufficient to grant citizenship.<ref>{{cite court | url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=112&page=94 | litigants=Elk v. Wilkins | vol=112 | reporter=U.S. | opinion=94 | date=1884 }}</ref>  U.S. citizenship law since ''Wong Kim Ark'' has acknowledged both citizenship through place of birth (''jus soli'') and citizenship inherited from parents (''jus sanguinis''). Wong Kim Ark's case was subsequently cited in two major Supreme Court decisions on citizenship: ''[[Perkins v. Elg]]'', {{ussc|307|325|1939}}, involving a U.S.-born woman (Marie Elg) who was alleged to have lost her U.S. citizenship when her Swedish immigrant parents (naturalized U.S. citizens) took her back to [[Sweden]] with them when she was a baby; and ''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'', {{ussc|387|253|1967}}, involving a naturalized U.S. citizen who subsequently moved to [[Israel]] and was alleged to have lost his U.S. citizenship after [[Vote|voting]] in an Israeli election.

''Wong Kim Ark'' was also cited in ''[[Plyler v. Doe]],'' {{ussc|457|202|1982}}, a Supreme Court decision which struck down a Texas state law that had sought to deny public education to undocumented alien children (i.e., children born abroad who had come to the United States illegally along with their parents<U+2014>''not'' children born in the U.S. to illegal alien parents).  The court's majority opinion in ''Plyler'' said that, according to the ''Wong'' court, the 14th Amendment's phrases "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" and "within its jurisdiction" were essentially equivalent and that both referred primarily to physical presence.<ref>{{cite court | url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=457&page=202#f10 | litigants=Plyler v.

=== Criticisms of ''Wong Kim Ark'' and birthright citizenship ===
Since the 1990s, controversy has arisen in some circles over the longstanding practice of granting automatic citizenship via ''jus soli'' to U.S.<U+2013>born children of illegal immigrants. This has been controversially dubbed the "[[anchor baby]]" situation by some media correspondents and advocacy groups.<ref>[http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2006_4196974 "'Border Baby' boom strains S. Texas"], ''Houston Chronicle'', September 24, 2006: "Immigration-control advocates regard the U.S.-born infants as 'anchor babies' because they give their undocumented parents and relatives a way to petition for citizenship."</ref>

John C. Eastman, a law professor at [[Chapman University]], has argued that ''Wong Kim Ark'' does not entitle U.S.<U+2013>born children of illegal immigrants to gain automatic citizenship, because being "subject to the jurisdiction" of the United States requires a status of "full and complete jurisdiction" that does not apply to aliens who are in the country illegally.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.heritage.org/research/legalissues/lm18.cfm | first=John C. | last=Eastman | title=From Feudalism to Consent: Rethinking Birthright Citizenship | journal=Legal Memorandum No. 18 | publisher=[[Heritage Foundation]] | location=Washington D.C. | date=March 30, 2006 | page=3 }}</ref>  Eastman further argues that the ''Wong Kim Ark'' decision was fundamentally flawed in the way it dealt with the concept of jurisdiction.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.heritage.org/research/legalissues/lm18.cfm | first=John C. | last=Eastman | title=From Feudalism to Consent: Rethinking Birthright Citizenship | journal=Legal Memorandum No. 18 | publisher=[[Heritage Foundation]] | location=Washington D.C. | date=March 30, 2006 | page=4 | quote=Justice Gray simply failed to appreciate what he seemed to have understood in ''Elk [v.

In response to fears that U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants could serve as [[Chain immigration|links]] to permit legal residency and eventual citizenship for family members who would otherwise be ineligible to remain in the country, [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]] have been introduced from time to time in Congress which have challenged the conventional interpretation of the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment and have sought to actively and explicitly deny citizenship at birth to U.S.-born children of foreign visitors or illegal aliens. As one example among many, the "Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009"<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.1868.IH: Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009], H.R. 1868 (111th Congress).</ref> <U+2014> introduced as H.R. 1868 in the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]] by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] Representative [[Nathan Deal]] <U+2014> would have excluded U.S.<U+2013>born children of illegal immigrants from being considered "subject to the jurisdiction" of the United States for purposes of the citizenship clause. Proposals have also been made, unsuccessfully,
to amend the Constitution to override the 14th Amendment's language and deny citizenship to such children <U+2014> such as S.J.Res. 6, introduced in the 111th Congress by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Louisiana]] Senator [[David Vitter]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.J.RES.6: |title=S. J. Res. 6 |publisher=thomas.loc.gov |date=January 16, 2009 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>  H.R. 1868 and S.J.Res. 6 failed to reach the floor of either house of Congress and died when the 111th Congress adjourned on December 22, 2010. As of the end of 2010, no other proposal of this type has ever been enacted into law or ratified as an amendment to the Constitution.
