=== Founding ===
[[Image:SulfurSpringAdjusted2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Sulphur Spring, renovated in 2005, was a major vacation spot for health seekers in the 1830s.]]

In 1841, Ohio residents Adam Poe and Charles Elliott decided to establish a university "of the highest order" in central Ohio.<ref>Williams, p. 15.</ref> To that end, they purchased the [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University buildings#Elliott Hall|Mansion House Hotel]], a former health resort with its Sulfur Spring, using funds raised from local residents.<ref name="elliott">{{cite web | url = http://catalog.owu.edu/cat-a09.pdf | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060306153516/http://catalog.owu.edu/cat-a09.pdf | archivedate = 2006-03-06|format=PDF| title = The University: Policy on Voluntary Sexual Relationships between Faculty/Staff and Students - Traditions (PDF) | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2005-09-01}}</ref><ref name="order">{{cite web | url = http://news.owu.edu/2003/elliott2.html| title = Elliott Hall Dedication | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2003-05-15}}</ref> Poe and Elliott wrote a charter emphasizing "the [[democracy|democratic]] spirit of teaching", which was approved by the [[Ohio]] State [[Legislature]]. Early in the following year they opened the [[college preparatory]] Academy and formed a [[Board of Trustees]].<ref>Hubbart, p. 14.</ref> Ohio Wesleyan University, named (like several other U.S. colleges and universities) after [[John Wesley]], founder of [[Methodism]], opened on November 13, 1844 as a Methodist-related but [[nonsectarian]] institution, with a College of Liberal Arts for male students.<ref name="liberal">{{cite web | url = http://go.owu.edu/~catalog/cat-a04.pdf|format=PDF| title = Ohio Wesleyan University Catalogue | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2004-09-01}}{{dead link|date=December 2009}}</ref><ref>White, p. 229.</ref><ref name="amongfirst">{{cite web | author= Labaree, David F. | url = http://www.stanford.edu/~dlabaree/U.S.%20Universities%20Sorted%20by%20Founding%20Date%20ver%202.doc | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070615130643/http://www.stanford.edu/~dlabaree/U.S.+Universities+Sorted+by+Founding+Date+ver+2.doc | archivedate = 2007-06-15| title = U.S. Colleges and Universities | publisher = | accessdate = 2006-10-19}}</ref>

Ohio Wesleyan's first president, [[Edward Thomson]], stated in his [[Inauguration|inaugural address]] on August 5, 1846 that the school was "a product of the [[classical liberalism|liberality]] of the local people."<ref>Hubbart, p. 22.</ref> This liberal philosophy contributed to Ohio Wesleyan's vocal opposition to [[slavery]] in the 1850s.<ref name="1850issues">{{cite web | url = http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=231791077249253| title = Roots of Secession: Slavery and Politics in Antebellum Virginia | publisher = University of North Carolina Press | accessdate = 2005-10-15}}</ref><ref name="thompson">{{cite web | url = http://members.aol.com/revepete/HolinessCh3.html | title = The Methodist Movement Comes to America and Impacts Slavery | publisher = Reve' M.

=== Curriculum growth and fundraising ===

Corns Building]. Ohio Wesleyan University, 2000-08-03.  Retrieved on 2007-01-08.</ref>]]

During the mid-19th century, Ohio Wesleyan focused on attracting students, adding fields of study, and fundraising, by which it significantly increased its endowment.<ref>Hubbart, p. 45.</ref> [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University buildings#Sturges Hall|Sturges Hall]] was constructed as the University's first library in 1855.<ref name="sturges">{{cite web | url = http://admission.owu.edu/sturges.html|title = Sturges Hall |publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University|accessdate = 2007-03-04}}</ref> In 1873, the school added the Department of Natural History housed in [[History of Ohio Wesleyan University#Campus expansion|Merrick Hall]].<ref name="merrick">{{cite web | url = http://botany.owu.edu/depthist.html|title = Departmental History |publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University|accessdate = 2007-03-04}}</ref> The [[Ohio Wesleyan Female College]], established in 1853, merged with the university in 1877.<ref>Taylor, p.53.</ref><ref name="merged">{{cite web | url = http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=787|title = Ohio Wesleyan University|publisher = Ohio Historical Society|accessdate = 2006-10-19}}</ref> Between 1876 and 1888, enrollment tripled and [[music education]] greatly increased, yet no major buildings were built in this time.<ref>Hubbart, p. 68.</ref><ref>Hubbart, pp. 72<U+2013>80.</ref>

By the end of the 19th century, Ohio Wesleyan had added a School of Music (1877), School of Fine Arts (1877), School of Oratory (1894), and Business School (1895) to the original College of Liberal Arts (founded in 1844).<ref>Kukula, R. & K. Trubner (1923). ''Minerva: Jahrbuch der Gelehrten Welt''. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter and Company</ref> To address the need for new departments and specialized instruction, the administration improved the facilities and courses to make them on par with OWU's new academic position. [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University buildings#University Hall|University Hall]], [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University buildings#Slocum Hall|Slocum Library]], extensions to the [[Ohio Wesleyan Female College|Monnett campus]], and athletic facilities were all constructed during that period.<ref>Hubbart, pp. 87<U+2013>88.</ref>
[[Image:GrayChapelAdjusted.jpg|right|thumb|250px|University Hall, built in 1893 on the academic quad, features [[Neoromanesque]] architecture.]]
Between 1891 and 1895, Ohio Wesleyan specialized the curriculum by establishing departments for [[physics]], [[zoology]], [[geology]], [[Public speaking|speech]], [[history]], [[French language|French]], [[English studies|English]], and [[economics]].<ref>Hubbart, p. 90.</ref> This specialization encouraged undergraduates to continue studies at graduate level, allowed professional preparation for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, and promoted exchange study in Europe.<ref name="nsfphdrate"> {{cite web | url = http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf06319/pdf/tabb1.pdf |format=PDF| title = Top 50 U.S. baccalaureate institutions of Ph.D.s: 1920<U+2013>24 and 1995<U+2013>99 (PDF)|publisher = National Science Foundation|accessdate = 2006-12-24}}</ref> Two professional schools for [[law]] and [[medicine]] were formed in 1896.

In 1905, the Board of Trustees decided to keep Ohio Wesleyan a college, despite the expansion of the curriculum and campus and the word "university" in the institution's name.<ref>Hubbart, p. 110.</ref> The [[Bachelor of Science]] degree was abolished, which left only the [[Bachelor of Arts]].

In the 1920s, academic requirements for the bachelor's degree were reduced, and Latin and mathematics were no longer emphasized.<ref>Hubbart, p. 142.</ref> During the presidency of [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University presidents|John W. Hoffman]] (1916<U+2013>1928), the Academy and School of Business were closed; the Academy had started in 1842 as a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]], and throughout its seventy-five years frequently outnumbered the college in enrollment.<ref>Hubbart, p. 127.</ref> Also in the 1920s, the chapel service was dropped and [[sororities]] were formed. Ohio Wesleyan also increased the number of buildings on campus, including Selby Stadium, Austin Manor, and [[Perkins Observatory]]; another building, Stuyvesant Hall, was in planning; and Edgar Hall was opened.<ref>Hubbart, p. 141.</ref>

=== Years of change, 1930<U+2013>1984 ===
[[Image:StuyFront.png|250px|left|thumb|Stuyvesant Hall, built in 1930, is the oldest residence in use on West Campus.]]
During [[the Great Depression]], both enrollment and [[alumni]] donations shrank.<ref>Hubbart, pp.140<U+2013>160.</ref> While the [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] size remained stable, lack of tuition and alumni revenues precipitated financial problems which threatened the college's survival in the administrations of [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University presidents|Edmund D. Soper]] (1928<U+2013>1938), Acting President [[Edward Loranus Rice]] (1938-1939), and [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University presidents|Herbert John Burgstahler]] (1939<U+2013>1949).<ref>Tull, p.180.</ref>

The administration adjusted the curriculum during the early 1930s to address these problems.<ref>Hubbart, pp. 160<U+2013>164.</ref> Greek and Latin declined, while business administration and economics thrived and the highest enrollments were in the social sciences, English, pre-medicine, and history. The registrar reported that, in these years, the number of students from [[New England]] states, urban Ohio areas, and from international locations increased. By the 1930s, the Methodist students were a minority among the student body;<ref>Burtchaell, pp. 174<U+2013>175;</ref> formal ties to the Methodist church were severed in the 1920s<ref>Burtchaell, p.304<U+2013>319.</ref> and led to debate among Board members in the 1930s, eventually resulting in the university's current active but loose historical affiliation with the [[United Methodist Church]].<ref>Burtchaell, p.323.</ref> In a study into the relationship between American educational institutions and the Christian denominations they were historically affiliated with, James Tunstead Burtuchell writes that it was during this period that "in its personnel, its resources, and its students", Ohio Wesleyan lost its "symbiotic intimacy with the United Methodist Church."<ref>Burtchaell, p. 326.</ref>

In 1946, Ohio Wesleyan introduced a new "Centennial Curriculum", which enacted seven distribution requirements across the sciences and humanities; the new requirement for a foreign language course was added to the existing humanities requirement.<ref name="Tull-182">Tull, p.182.</ref> Thomson and Bashford Halls, originally men's dorms, were built between 1951 and 1954.<ref name="Tull-182"/> In the 1960s, faculty, staff and administrators fought over administrative structure and control.<ref>Tull, pp.182<U+2013>183.</ref> They eventually settled on a new "statement of aims" that stressed values, rather than religious goal statements, and instituted a more internationalized curriculum, a new Women's Studies Program, and an International Business major; the faculty senate also introduced a new academic calendar with three 10.5-week terms.<ref>Tull, p.183</ref>

Thomas Wenzlau's presidency (1968<U+2013>1984) began with the challenge of campus unrest: Ohio Wesleyan students took over the [[ROTC]] building, demanded its shut-down, and eventually eliminated ROTC in 1970.<ref>Murchland, p.34</ref><ref>Murchland, p.74.</ref> Students also demanded participation in departmental meetings and faculty committees, and the democratic process in the governance of Ohio Wesleyan grew in this period.<ref>Murchland, p.35</ref> Wenzlau's presidency witnessed decline in students' test scores, an unusually high attrition rate, lack of adequate research to identify potential major donors and a growing "[[party school]]" image,<ref>Murchland, p.38<U+2013>39</ref> leading to a rocky relationship between him and the student body.<ref>Murchland, p.39</ref> Between 1979 and 1982, the campus newspaper ''[[The Transcript]]'' frequently criticized Wenzlau's  presidency, blaming it for "severely affecting the reputation of the college".<ref>Murchland, p.41</ref> This exchange resulted in a ''[[Washington Post]]'' report on the school that eventually precipitated the end of Wenzlau's presidency.<ref name="OWUandWP"> Peterson, Bill. "Enrollments Lower, Costs Higher". ''The Washington Post'', December 19, 1982, First Section, A5.</ref>

=== 1984<U+2013>today ===


The new president, David Warren, increased admission standards in 1985, engaged students in a "live-in" presidency, expanded media exposure and established a National Colloquium focused on the liberal arts.<ref>Murchland, p.44<U+2013>45</ref> Warren engaged in forty-one interviews on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[NBC]] networks.<ref>Murchland, p.45</ref>

More recently, Ohio Wesleyan has achieved several academic and athletic recognitions. A 1986 study, titled "Educating America's Scientists: The Role of the Research Colleges," identified Ohio Wesleyan as one of 48 highly selective "science-active" liberal arts institutions in the nation.<ref>[http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=RecordDetails&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED258532&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&objectId=0900000b801160bc Educating America's Scientists: The Role of the Research Colleges].

Ohio Wesleyan continues to undertake construction projects. The new Hamilton Williams Campus Center opened in 1991. The Memorial Union Building was renovated in 2001 to accommodate the Economics Department, the Academic Resource Center, the Information Services portion of the combined Libraries and Information Services department, and the Woltemade Center for Economics, Business and Entrepreneurship.

=== Emphasis on internationalism ===
[[Image:UniversityHallFlags.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Flags in University Hall of students' countries represented at Ohio Wesleyan University.]]
Ohio Wesleyan has upheld academic [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] since its early years; since the 19th century, the college has established links with several international schools. In 1879, OWU alumna Elizabeth Russell founded [[Kwassui College|Kwassui Women's College]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Japan]], when predominant Japanese culture considered women's education unimportant.<ref>{{cite book | last = Windolf | first = Paul | coauthors = Francisco Ramirze | year = 1989 | title = Expansion and Structural Change: Higher Education in Germany, the United States, and Japan, 1870<U+2013>1990 | publisher = Contemporary Sociology | location= | id =Vol. 27, No. 2}}</ref> Today, Kwasuii College is one of the top finishing schools for young women in Japan.<ref name="kwassuijp">{{cite web | url = http://www.kwassui.ac.jp/ | title = Kwassui Institute|publisher = Kwassui Institute|accessdate = 2006-10-15}}</ref> In 1899, William Ehnis (from the class of 1898) traveled to [[Africa]] and opened a school in [[Mutare]], [[Zimbabwe]], that eventually became the [[University of Africa|Africa University]].<ref name="africauniv">{{cite web | url = http://www.africau.edu/ | title = Africa University | publisher = Africa University | accessdate = 2006-10-15}}</ref>
[[Image:Plaza-mayor-salamanco.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Main Square of Salamanca. In March 1988, Conrad Kent established the popular Salamanca Spanish Program for Ohio Wesleyan students.]]
The school also manifests international interest in the percentage of international students it recruits and enrolls annually.

== Campus ==
{{Main|List of Ohio Wesleyan University buildings}}
{{seealso|Richard Ross Museum of Art|Ohio Wesleyan University Library|The Strand Theatre}}
The Ohio Wesleyan campus is next to downtown Delaware, and is bisected by Sandusky Street, the main north/south street through the heart of the city. The street informally divides the campus into an eastern sector composed mainly of academic buildings and a western sector composed mainly of residential and administrative buildings. Many facilities have been constructed in the last two years, with substantial benefit to science, art, and athletic programs on campus.

=== Other facilities and off-campus programs ===
{{Main|Perkins Observatory|Ohio Wesleyan Arts Castle|The Strand Theatre}}

OWU operates several facilities outside campus: The Philadelphia Business Center, Wesleyan in Washington, The New York Arts Program for the performing, visual and media arts (a GLCA arts program), [[Perkins Observatory]], [[The Strand Theatre]], and the [[Kraus Preserve of Ohio Wesleyan University|Kraus Wilderness Preserve]].

Perkins Observatory is situated in Delaware on land separate to the main campus.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.perkins-observatory.org/programs.html#directions | title = How to find us | publisher = Perkins Observatory | accessdate = 2006-11-30}}</ref> The observatory is named after [[Hiram Perkins]], a former professor of mathematics and astronomy at the college.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.perkins-observatory.org/history.html#hiram | title = Hiram Perkins|publisher = Perkins Observatory|accessdate = 2006-11-30}}</ref> When the observatory was built in 1931, it housed the third-largest [[telescope]] in the world, which has since been moved to [[Arizona]].<ref name=PerkinsHistory>{{cite web | url = http://www.perkins-observatory.org/history.html#69 | title = History of Perkins Observatory | publisher = Perkins Observatory|accessdate = 2006-11-30}}</ref> The Perkins dome now houses a {{convert|32|in|mm|sing=on}} telescope, which is the second-largest in Ohio.

The university also maintains offices for [[study abroad]], US domestic study, and [[internship]] programs. Such programs include: Wesleyan in Washington, which allows students to study for a semester in [[Washington, D.C.]], in research and [[internship]] positions.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://connect2.owu.edu/newsandviews/49.php | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060901174920/http://connect2.owu.edu/newsandviews/49.php | archivedate = 2006-09-01 | title = Learning in Washington | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2006-10-14}}</ref> The Philadelphia Center offers students hundreds of internship and field placement opportunities off-campus and the chance to live independently.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://connect2.owu.edu/newsandviews/52.php | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060901175021/http://connect2.owu.edu/newsandviews/52.php | archivedate = 2006-09-01 | title = Philadelphia Center Gives Students Taste of Life in the Big City | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2006-11-30}}</ref> and the New York Arts Program, which allows students of the arts to gain a semester of hands on experience in the arts in [[New York City]].<ref name=NYArtsProgram>{{cite web | url = http://www.newyorkartsprogram.org | title = Wesleyan Arts Program | publisher = New York Arts Program |accessdate = 2007-11-21}}</ref>

=== Traditions ===
{{seealso|Ohio Wesleyan Sweetly and strong}}

Many Ohio Wesleyan traditions originate from its early years. Monnett Weekend, beginning in 1896, welcomes female alumni, parents, and friends of the university. Events include a "People's Parade" with clowns, banners and marching, faculty lectures, Maypole dancing, Choral Arts Society, and an all-campus carnival.<ref>Murchland, p.79.</ref><ref>Hubbart, p. 121.</ref> It started as a girls' athletic f<U+00EA>te held at the Monnett Athletic Club for Mothers Day. All events were held at the [[Ohio Wesleyan Female College|Monnett Campus]], where female students danced around the [[Maypole]], while men were barred. The men, in turn, developed their own tradition: they arrived at Monnett Campus early in the morning, and concealed themselves in trees to watch the festivities, discreetly.<ref>Tull, p.102.</ref>

In 1884, Ohio Wesleyan held its first ''Mock Convention'', which has recurred in every [[presidential election]] year since 1920.<ref name="mockconvention">{{cite web | url = http://go.owu.edu/%7Emock2004/cygnus/rules.htm | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060902092424/http://go.owu.edu/~mock2004/cygnus/rules.htm | archivedate = 2006-09-02| title = Mock Convention

=== Housing ===
[[Image:PeaceandJusticeWinter.jpg|thumb|right|The House of Peace and Justice, a Small Living Unit on West Campus.]]
The university can house up to 1,600 students on campus.<ref name = "housingcapacity"/> First-year students are required to live on campus during their first two semesters. A lottery system matches second to fourth-year students with dormitories and another lottery system determines how many students are allowed to live in off-campus housing. Housing options include dormitories, small living units, fraternities, and cooperative housing.<ref name="generalhousing">{{cite web | url = http://admission.owu.edu/reslife.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070303012234/http://admission.owu.edu/reslife.html | archivedate = 2007-03-03 | title = Residential Life | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2007-01-05}}</ref>

[[Image:N24101750 30197695 4010.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Students converse on the back porch of The House of Peace and Justice, a Small Living Unit on West Campus.]]
Approximately 200 non-freshmen students live in Small Living Units (SLUs), which are [[cooperative|co-ops]] united voluntarily to meet shared economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations in democratically controlled houses. The houses allow students to live cooperatively with one another by sharing regularly scheduled house chores, participating in the decision process, and, in some, sharing the cooking duties. Each unit houses a group of 15 students, and is organized to promote a common theme, usually indicated by the co-op's name. As of the 2008<U+2013>2009 academic year, the SLUs consist of The [[Peace]] and [[Justice]] House, The [[Internationalism (politics)|International]] House, The House of [[Black (people)|Black]] Culture, The Creative [[Arts]] House, The [[Women]]'s House, The Modern Foreign [[Language]] House, The House of Thought, The [[Ecology|Tree]] House, and The Interfaith House. The University owns these houses; the co-ops, therefore, must follow the University's living policies. The co-ops do, however, elect their own officers and do not have [[resident assistant|Resident Advisers]] or faculty in residence like other on-campus residence halls. They have a House Moderator who undergoes the same training as a Resident Advisor.
