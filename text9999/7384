The '''Berlin Social Science Research Center''' ({{lang-de|Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin f<U+00FC>r Sozialforschung}}, '''WZB'''), also known by its German initials WZB, is an internationally renowned [[research institute]] for the [[social sciences]], the largest such institution in Europe not affiliated with a university.

It was founded in 1969 through an all-party initiative of the German ''[[Bundestag]]''.<ref name="time">[http://www.wzb.eu/wzb/chronik.en.htm "Brief Timeline of the WZB"], accessed 2008-07-02</ref> Around 140 German and foreign sociologists, political scientists, economists, historians, statisticians, computer scientists and legal scholars work in the WZB conducting [[basic research]] on selected social and political issues, concentrating on the industrialized societies of Japan and the West, as well as the transformations of Central and Eastern Europe and China. The question of globalization is of particular importance.<ref>[http://www.wzb.eu/wzb/selbstverst.en.htm "Positioning WZB Research in the Scientific Landscape"], accessed 2008-07-02</ref>

The WZB is organized into four research areas:

# [[Education]], [[employment|work]] and life opportunities
# [[Market]] [[policies]]
# [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic impacts]]
# [[Civil society]], [[conflict]]s and [[democracy]]

Constituted as a non-profit [[Gesellschaft mit beschr<U+00E4>nkter Haftung|limited liability company (GmbH)]], ownership is shared between the governments of the [[Politics of Germany|German Federal Republic]] (75 percent) and the city-state of [[Berlin]] (25 percent).<ref name="time" /> WZB is a member of a partnership of research institutes known as the [[Leibniz-Gemeinschaft]].

Although not a university body, it collaborates with the [[Free University of Berlin]], with the [[Technical University of Berlin]] and with research institutions abroad. Many WZB scientists are also university professors or hold teaching assignments.

Recent presidents of the WZB have included [[Meinolf Dierkes]] (1980-1987), [[Wolfgang Zapf]] (1987-1994), [[Friedhelm Neidhardt]] (1994-2000), and historian [[J<U+00FC>rgen Kocka]] (2001-2007).<ref>[http://www.wzb.eu/wzb/ehemalige.en.htm Former Presidents], accessed 2008-07-02</ref> The current president is sociologist [[Jutta Allmendinger]].<ref>[http://www.wzb.eu/wzb/allmendinger.en.htm Prof. Jutta Allmendinger, curriculum vitae], accessed 2008-07-02</ref>

WZB claims to be the largest such research institution in [[Europe]].{{fact|date=November 2008}} Around 140 social scientists are conducting research on the developmental trends, problems of adaptation, and possibilities for innovation in modern societies.
 
The [[Federal Republic of Germany]] and the Land Berlin have been shareholders and funders since 1976.
