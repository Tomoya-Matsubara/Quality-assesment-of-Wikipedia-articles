One of the filmmakers travels to different parts of the [[Uzbek SSR]] in search of potential actors. Wherever he goes he meets exceptionally talented people and hears about other gifted people in different parts of the country. The actors for the movie were in fact chosen from different parts of Uzbekistan. Almost all of the songs featured in the film became immensely popular and remain so today. Many know by heart the songs from this movie. The songs "Do`ppi tikdim" ("I've Made a Hat"), "Go`zal Toshk<U+0435>nt" ("Beautiful Tashkent"), "Maftun bo`ldim" ("Delighted by You"), and "Sartarosh" ("Barber") are all-time favorites of Uzbeks. ''Maftuningman'' depicts many interesting aspects of the Uzbek culture and life in Soviet [[kolkhoz]]es.
