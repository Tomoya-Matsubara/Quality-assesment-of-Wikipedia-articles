'''James "Jemmy" Moore''' (1839 <U+2013> 19 April 1890) was an Australian [[cricket]]er who played a single {{Cric FC}} match for [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]] during the 1861<U+2013>62 season.

Born in [[Ampthill]], [[Bedfordshire]], Moore was the much younger brother of [[George Moore (cricketer)|George Moore]], who had emigrated to Australia in 1852. Jemmy Moore joined his brother in [[New South Wales]] later in the decade, assisting with his baking and confectionary business in [[Maitland, New South Wales|Maitland]]. The Moore brothers were both keen cricketers, and, according to one source, were at one point "undoubtedly the best bowlers in New South Wales".<ref name="obit">(22 April 1890).

In New South Wales' second innings (after [[follow on|following on]]), he was the second highest scorer, with 21 runs.
