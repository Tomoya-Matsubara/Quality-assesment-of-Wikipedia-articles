==Biography==
Harcourt was born at [[Sudbury Hall]], [[Derbyshire]] on the [[10 October]] 1757. He was educated at [[Westminster School]]; matriculated at [[Christ Church, Oxford]] on the [[2 July]] 1774 ; was elected fellow of [[All Souls College]] in 1777 ; and graduated B.C.L. 27 April 1786, and D.C.L. [[4 May]] following. After his ordination he was instituted to the family living of [[Sudbury, Derbyshire|Sudbury]]. He became a canon of [[Christ Church, Oxford]], [[13 October]] 1785, and a [[prebendary]] of [[Gloucester]] on [[10 November]] in the same year . He resigned his prebendal stall in 1791, but held his other appointments to 1808. 

On [[18 August]] 1791 he was nominated [[Bishop of Carlisle]]<ref name=book/> in succession to Dr. [[John Douglas]], and was consecrated on [[6 November]] following. For sixteen years he administered the affairs of the see of Carlisle with good sense and discretion, spending more than the whole income of the see upon the wants of his diocese.<ref name=dnb/>

==Archbishop of York==
After the death of Archbishop [[William Markham, Archbishop of York|William Markiam]]. Harcourt was nominated on the [[26 November]] 1807 as archbishop of York<ref name=book/>, and was confirmed in St. James's Church, [[Westminster]] on the [[19 January]] 1808.<ref>[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgbmxd/success1.htm Episcopal succession at ucl.ac.uk] accessed [[10 November]] 2007</ref> In the same year, on [[20 January]], he was gazetted a [[privy councillor]], and made [[Lord High Almoner]] to [[George III]], an office which he also held under [[Queen Victoria]]'s reign.

Harcourt was a member of the queen's council who had charge of [[George III]] during his illness. He was an eloquent speaker, and occasionally spoke in the [[House of Lords]] on ecclesiastical matters, but usually abstained from political contentions. He lived under five successive monarchs, and was respected for benevolence and simplicity of character. On [[15 January]] 1831 he took the surname of Harcourt only on inheriting the large estates of the Harcourt family, which came to him on the death of his cousin, Field-marshal [[William Harcourt, 3rd Earl Harcourt|William, third and last Earl Harcourt]].<ref name=dnb/>

In 1835 he was appointed one of the first members of the ecclesiastical commission. In 1838 he was offered the renewal of the Harcourt peerage, but declined it, not wishing to be fettered in his parliamentary votes. [[York Minster]] was twice burnt down during his primacy, 1829 and 1841, and he contributed largely to both restorations. Archbishop Harcourt preached his valedictory sermon in York Minster on [[13 November]] 1838. However Harcourt continued to enjoy good health, and as late as [[1 November]] 1847 visited York and inspected the repairs of the chapterhouse. He died at the palace, [[Bishopthorpe]], near [[York]], on [[5 November]] 1847, and was buried at [[Stanton Harcourt]], Oxfordshire, [[13 Nov]]<ref name=dnb/>

==Family==
On [[5 February]] 1784 he married Anne Leveson-Gower, third daughter of Granville, first [[marquis of Stafford]] and they had sixteen children. His wife died at [[Bishopthorpe Palace]] on the [[16 November]] 1832, aged 72. 

His second son, the Rev. Levesox Vernon Harcourt<ref>1788-1860</ref>, was chancellor of York and the author of ''The Doctrine of the Deluge,''<ref>London, 1838 in 2 volumes</ref>, and of other theological works. His fourth son was [[William Vernon Harcourt (scientist)|William Vernon Harcourt]], the founder of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]]. His eighth son was [[Octavius Vernon Harcourt|Admiral Octavius Henry Cyril Harcourt]]<ref name=dnb/> whilst his youngest daughter, [[Georgiana Harcourt|Georgiana]], distinguished herself as a translator.

==Cato Street conspiracy==
As a director of the Ancient Concerts, Harcourt entertained his fellow-directors (the [[prince regent]] and [[Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge|Prince Adolphus - the Duke of Cambridge]], [[Ernest Augustus I of Hanover|the Duke of Cumberland]] (later Ernest Augustus I of Hanover), and [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]]) at his house in [[Grosvenor Square]] on [[23 February]] 1821. On the same night the [[Cato Street conspiracy|Cato Street conspirators]] had designed the murder of the cabinet ministers at the house adjoining Harcourt's, where the ministers had agreed to dine with [[Dudley Ryder, 1st Earl of Harrowby|Lord Harrowby]].<ref name=dnb/>
