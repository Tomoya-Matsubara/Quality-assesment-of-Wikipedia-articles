'''Arthur Frank Burns''' (April 27, 1904 in [[Ivano-Frankivsk|Stanis<U+0142>aw<U+00F3>w]], [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] (now Ivano-Frankivsk, [[Ukraine]]){{spaced ndash}}June 6, 1987 in [[Baltimore]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[economist]]. He served as [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]] from 1970 to 1978.
== Career ==
Born in Stanislawow, [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], province of the [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire]], Arthur Burns soon immigrated with his Austro-Hungarian [[Jewish]] parents to New Jersey. He earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] and [[Ph.D]] (1934) from [[Columbia University]], studying under [[Wesley Clair Mitchell]]. His career alternated between academia and government. He taught at Columbia and studied [[business cycle]]s while president of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]]. At Columbia, he blocked the acceptance of [[Murray Rothbard]]'s [[thesis]] on the [[Panic of 1819]], despite having known Rothbard since the latter was a child.<ref name=French>French, Doug (2010-12-27) [http://mises.org/daily/4919/Burns-Diary-Exposes-the-Myth-of-Fed-Independence Burns Diary Exposes the Myth of Fed Independence], [[Mises Institute]]</ref> Burns was the chairman of the U.S. [[Council of Economic Advisors]] from 1953 to 1956 under [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s presidency. In 1953, he stated the American economy's "ultimate purpose is to produce more consumer goods." He served as the [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]] from 1970&ndash;1978 and as ambassador to [[West Germany]] from 1981&ndash;1985.

=== Academia ===
The academic part of Burns's career focused on the measurement of [[business cycles]], including questions such as the duration of [[economic expansion]]s, and what economic variables rise during expansions and fall during [[recessions]]. He often collaborated with [[Wesley Clair Mitchell]] and set the academic tradition continued by the NBER's business cycle dating committee, which is generally considered authoritative in dating recessions. Burns's detailed [[macroeconomic]] analysis influenced [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]]'s classic work ''A Monetary History of the United States, 1867&ndash;1960''.

=== Federal Reserve Chairman ===
Burns served as Fed Chairman from February 1970 until the end of January 1978. He has a reputation of having been overly influenced by political pressure in his monetary policy decisions during his time as Chairman<ref name=Bartlett>[[Bruce Bartlett|Bartlett, Bruce]] (2004-04-28) [http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/210446/more-politics-fed/bruce-bartlett (More) Politics at the Fed?], ''[[National Review]]''</ref> and for supporting the policy, widely accepted in political and economic circles at the time, that Fed action should try to maintain an unemployment rate of around 4 percent.<ref name=Hetzel>Hetzel, Robert L., "Arthur Burns and Inflation," ''Economic Quarterly'', The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Volume 84/1, Winter 1998, pages 21<U+2013>44</ref> (''See also: [[Phillips curve]]'')

When [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard M. Nixon]] was running for [[President of the United States|President]] in 1959<U+2013>1960, the Fed, under the [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]]-appointed [[William McChesney Martin, Jr.]], was undertaking a [[monetary tightening]] policy that resulted in a recession in April 1960.{{elucidate|date=March 2011}}  In his book ''[[Six Crises]]'', Nixon later blamed his [[United States presidential election, 1960|defeat in 1960]] in part on Fed policy and the resulting tight credit conditions and slow growth.  After finally winning the [[United States presidential election, 1968|presidential election of 1968]], Nixon named Burns to the Fed Chairmanship in 1970 with instructions to ensure easy access to credit when Nixon was running for reelection in 1972.<ref name=Bartlett/>

Later, when Burns resisted, negative press about him was planted in newspapers and, under the threat of legislation to dilute the Fed's influence, Burns and other Governors succumbed.<ref name=Safire>[[William Safire|Safire, William]], ''Before the Fall: An Inside View of the Pre-Watergate White House'', Transaction Publishers, 2005</ref><ref name=Greider>Greider, William, ''Secrets of the Temple: How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country'', Simon & Schuster, 1989</ref> Burns' relationship with Nixon was often rocky. Reflecting in his diary about a 1971 meeting attended by himself, Nixon, [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[John Connally]], the Chairman of the [[Council of Economic Advisors]], and the Director of the [[Bureau of the Budget]], Burns wrote:

{{cquote|The President looked wild; talked like a desperate man; fulminated with hatred against the press; took some of us to task <U+2014> apparently meaning me or [chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, Paul] [[Paul McCracken|McCraken]] or both <U+2014> for not putting a gay and optimistic face on every piece of economic news, however discouraging; propounded the theory that confidence can be best generated by appearing confident and coloring, if need be, the news.<ref name=French/>}}

There was significant [[inflation]] during this period, which Nixon attempted to manage through [[Incomes policy|wage and price controls]] while the Fed under Burns maintained an expansive{{elucidate|date=March 2011}} [[monetary policy]]. Although Burns opposed [[Nixon Shock|Nixon's decision to close the "gold window,"]] he "'assured the President that I would support his new program fully,' notwithstanding his reservations about the gold suspension."<ref name=French/> After the 1972 election, due in part to oil shocks from the [[1973 oil crisis]], price controls began to fail and by 1974, the inflation rate was 12.3 percent.<ref name=Bartlett/>

Burns thought the country was not willing to accept rates of [[unemployment]] in the range of six percent as a means of quelling inflation.  From the Board of Governors meeting minutes of November 1970, Burns believed that:

:...prospects were dim for any easing of the cost-push inflation generated by union demands. However, the Federal Reserve could not do anything about those influences except to impose monetary restraint, and he did not believe the country was willing to accept for any long period an unemployment rate in the area of 6 percent. Therefore, he believed that the Federal Reserve should not take on the responsibility for attempting to accomplish by itself, under its existing powers, a reduction in the rate of inflation to, say, 2 percent... he did not believe that the Federal Reserve should be expected to cope with inflation single-handedly. The only effective answer, in his opinion, lay in some form of [[incomes policy]].<ref name=Hetzel/>

During Burns' tenure, the [[consumer price index]] rose from 6%/year in early 1970 to over 12%/year in late 1974 after the Arab Oil embargo, and eventually falling to under 7%/year from 1976 to the end of his tenure in January, 1978, with an annual average rate of consumer price inflation of approximately 9% during his term.  Negative economic events included multiple oil shocks ([[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]]) and heavy government [[Government budget deficit|deficits]] arising in part from the [[Vietnam War]] and [[Great Society]] government programs. When he was later asked by a German reporter why he pursued such unsuccessful policies, Burns said "a Fed chairman has to do what the president demands, or 'the central bank would lose its independence.'"<ref name=French/>

At the [[Watergate break-in]] of 1972, the burglars were found carrying $6300 of sequentially-numbered $100 bills. The Fed lied to reporter [[Bob Woodward]] as to the source of the bills. Burns stonewalled Congressional investigations about them and issued a directive to all Fed offices prohibiting any discussion of the subject.<ref name="auerbach">Robert D. Auerbach, ''Deception and Abuse at the Fed'', ch. 2</ref>

=== Commentary ===

Conservative economist [[Bruce Bartlett]] gives Burns poor marks for his tenure as Fed chairman because the inflationary forces that began in 1970 took more than a decade to resolve. "The only disagreement among economists is whether Burns fully understood the mistakes he was making, or was so wedded to incorrect Keynesian theories that he didn't realize what he was doing. The only alternative is that he was under irresistible political pressure from Nixon and had no choice. Neither explanation is very favorable to Burns. Economists now recognize the Nixon era as Exhibit A in how the adoption of bad economic policies in pursuit of short-term political gain eventually turns out to be bad politics as well."<ref>[[Bruce Bartlett]], ''Impostor: How George W. Bush Bankrupted America and Betrayed the Reagan Legacy'', New York: Doubleday, 2006, p. 147</ref>

Abstract: The 1953-54 recession was the first in which a Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) appointed by a Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, recommended policy actions. Despite traditional Republican Party rhetoric, the CEA supported an activist contracyclical approach that helped to establish Keynesianism as a bipartisan economic policy for the nation. Especially important in formulating the CEA response to the recession - accelerating public works programs, easing credit, and reducing taxes - were Arthur F. Burns and Neil H. Jacoby.

Abstract: Reviews the debate over the inflation-unemployment trade-off, which was a critical part of the 1960 presidential election campaign. At the 1959 American Economic Association Conference (AEAC), Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow, economists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, argued that the application of American wage and price statistical data to the Phillips curve indicated high levels of employment could be achieved with moderate levels of inflation. While this proposition supported John F. Kennedy's goal of minimizing unemployment, Richard Nixon advocated zero inflation and was supported in this policy by Arthur Burns, who delivered the 1959 AEAC presidential address. Burns was an opponent of [[Keynesian economics]] and personified the anti-Keynesian sentiment that prevailed in the United States in the 1950s. Keynesianism and communism were seen by many at the time to be one and the same.
