The '''Talyllyn Railway''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''Rheilffordd Talyllyn'') is a [[narrow gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] [[heritage railway|preserved]] railway running for {{convert|7.25|mi|km}}<ref>Boyd 1965, page 85</ref> from [[Tywyn]]{{cref|a}} on the [[Mid-Wales]] coast to [[Nant Gwernol railway station|Nant Gwernol]] near the village of [[Abergynolwyn]]. The line was opened in 1866 to carry [[slate]] from the quarries at [[Bryn Eglwys]] to Tywyn, and was the first narrow gauge railway in Britain authorised by [[Act of Parliament#United Kingdom|Act of Parliament]] to carry passengers using steam haulage.<ref>Mitchell and Eyres, 2005 page 7</ref><ref>Boyd 1988, page 44</ref> Despite severe under-investment,<ref>Rolt 1965, page 50</ref> the line remained open, and in 1951 it became the first railway in the world to be preserved as a heritage railway by volunteers.<ref>Thomas 2002, page 32</ref><ref>Ransom 1996, page 139</ref> 

Since preservation, the railway has operated as a [[tourist attraction]], significantly expanding its rolling stock through acquisition and an engineering programme to build new locomotives and carriages. In 1976 an extension was opened along the former mineral line from Abergynolwyn to the new station at Nant Gwernol. In 2001 the preservation society celebrated its 50th anniversary, and in 2005 a major rebuilding and extension of [[Tywyn Wharf railway station|Tywyn Wharf station]] took place, including a much expanded facility for the [[Narrow Gauge Railway Museum]].

The origin of the railway's name is uncertain: it may refer to the parish of [[Talyllyn]], which contains its eastern terminus,<ref>Johnson 1999, page 27</ref> or it may come from [[Tal-y-llyn Lake|Tal-y-llyn]],{{cref|b}} a large glacial [[ribbon lake]] at the foot of [[Cadair Idris]] {{convert|3|mi|km}} further east.<ref>Boyd 1965, page 61<U+2013>62</ref> The 2&nbsp;feet 3&nbsp;inches (686&nbsp;mm) [[rail gauge|gauge]] of the [[rail tracks|track]] is unusual, and was shared by only three other public railways in the United Kingdom: the nearby [[Corris Railway]] (which predated the Talyllyn), and the subsequent [[Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway]] and [[Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway]].

The fictional [[Skarloey Railway]], which formed part of [[the Railway Series]] of children's books by the [[Rev. W Awdry]], was based on the Talyllyn Railway. The preservation of the line inspired the [[Ealing Comedy]] film ''[[The Titfield Thunderbolt]].

==History==
===Origins and construction: up to 1866 ===
[[Slate industry in Wales|Slate quarrying]] began in the hills above Tywyn in the 1830s, but although many small quarries and test levels were established, only one major quarry was developed in the region, at [[Bryn Eglwys]], {{convert|7|mi|km}} north east of the town.  Underground working began in the early 1840s,<ref name=AJR195>Richards 1999, page 195</ref> and by 1847 the quarry was being worked by local landowner John Pughe. The finished slates were sent by [[packhorse]] to the wharf at [[Pennal]], transferred to boats for a river trip to [[Aberdyfi]] (also known as Aberdovey), and then finally loaded into sea-going vessels, a complex and expensive transportation arrangement which limited the quarry's output.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 62<U+2013>63</ref>  In 1861 the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] cut off supplies of [[cotton]] to the [[Cotton mill|mills]] of the north west of England and as a result a number of prosperous mill owners looked for new business opportunities to diversify their interests. One such owner was [[William McConnel]] of [[Lancashire]] who, in 1859, had purchased a house near [[Dolgellau]], north of Tywyn. In January 1864, McConnel formed the Aberdovey Slate Company, which leased the land including Bryn Eglwys from the landowner, Lewis Morris of [[Machynlleth]].<ref>Boyd 1988, page 9</ref>

[[Image:Tivedshambo 2008-03-18 Bryn Eglwys quarry.jpg|thumb|left|The remains of Bryn Eglwys quarry in 2008]]
McConnel set about improving Bryn Eglwys to increase its output and in 1865 his company earmarked money for the construction of a narrow gauge railway connecting the quarry with the port of Aberdyfi. The standard gauge [[Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway]] was expanding rapidly from its base at Machynlleth, however, and in 1863 had reached Tywyn, so McConnel decided to build his line from the quarry to Tywyn, as the nearest point where slate could be transferred to the standard gauge railway.  This was despite the fact that the line was initially isolated from the rest of the system because of difficulties in bridging the estuary of the [[Afon Dyfi]] to the south.<ref>Boyd 1965, page 64</ref>  An [[Act of Parliament#United Kingdom|Act of Parliament]] (28 and 29&nbsp;[[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Vict]], cap cccxv) allowing the company to operate passenger trains as a public railway was given [[Royal Assent]] on [[5 July]] [[1865]],<ref>Boyd 1988, page 45</ref><ref>Potter, page 11</ref> and the company appointed [[The Spooners of Porthmadog|James Swinton Spooner]] as engineer for the construction. He laid out plans for a relatively straight line climbing steadily from Tywyn to the quarry and work quickly got underway. By September 1866 construction had advanced to the point where the [[Board of Trade]] inspector Captain Henry Tyler could make an initial inspection and report.<ref>Boyd 1965, page 65</ref>

Tyler's report led to an unusual alteration, as it was discovered that the [[loading gauge]] of the line was too small.  The internal width of the overbridges was only {{convert|9|ft|1|in|cm|abbr=on}}, but the railway's [[Talyllyn Railway rolling stock#Carriages|passenger carriages]] were {{convert|5|ft|3.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} wide, leaving less than {{convert|2|ft|cm|abbr=on}} clearance on either side, less than the minimum required clearance of {{convert|2|ft|6|in|cm|abbr=on}}. To alleviate this problem, McConnel proposed that the doors on one side of each carriage be permanently barred and the track slewed off-centre beneath the bridges to allow adequate clearance at least on the side with doors, which would allow passengers to get out of the carriages if the train stopped underneath a bridge. Tyler agreed to this arrangement, and to this day all carriages on the Talyllyn have doors on one side only, an unusual feature for a public railway which is shared (albeit for different reasons) with the neighbouring Corris Railway.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 68<U+2013>69</ref>  Tyler also required that improvements be made to the railway's first two steam locomotives, as locomotive No.&nbsp;1 suffered from excessive "vertical motion" and No.&nbsp;2 was said to suffer from "horizontal oscillation". No.&nbsp;1 was returned to its manufacturer where a set of [[trailing wheel]]s was added to reduce the rear overhang, and the [[Suspension_%28vehicle%29#Springs_and_dampers|springs]] on No.&nbsp;2 were adjusted and the [[crank pin]]s shortened to reduce its oscillation.<ref name=Boyd6570>Boyd 1965, page 70</ref>

Tyler did not approve the opening until his listed improvements were completed. During the first half of 1866, the various changes required were made and construction of the line was finished, and in October 1866 the railway began an unofficial passenger service, despite not being authorised by the Board of Trade.<ref>Woodcock 1938, page 197</ref> Passengers were carried "at their own risk" and possibly free of charge until the line was officially sanctioned. In November of that year, Tyler returned to Tywyn and re-inspected the railway following which, subject to some further minor improvements, he approved its formal opening for passenger service. The first public passenger timetable was issued in December 1866,<ref>Rolt 1998, page 13</ref> and the first purpose-built, steam-worked, narrow gauge public railway in Britain opened for service.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 68<U+2013>70</ref>

===Prosperity under McConnel: 1866<U+2013>1880s===
[[Image:TalyllynOnDolgochViaduct.jpg|thumb|right|''Talyllyn'' posed on Dolgoch Viaduct around 1867]]
The railway opened with two locomotives, one carriage and several goods vehicles in use and was operated under a "[[Safeworking#One Engine in Steam|one engine in steam]]" policy to ensure that two trains could not collide.<ref name=Boyd6571>Boyd 1965, page 71</ref> Initially the working locomotive was housed in a wooden shed at Ty Dwr on the mineral line above [[Abergynolwyn railway station|Abergynolwyn station]], while the main engineering works at {{stnlnk|Pendre}} were constructed.<ref>Boyd 1988, page 149</ref> The Pendre works opened on [[17 February]] [[1867]] and from then on trains began working from Pendre instead of Abergynolwyn.<ref name=Boyd6570/>  

At the time of the line's opening, stations were provided at Pendre and Abergynolwyn. In 1867, the halt at {{stnlnk|Rhydyronen}} opened, followed by {{stnlnk|Brynglas}} and {{stnlnk|Dolgoch}} in 1873. Some time shortly after the opening of the railway a branch to Abergynolwyn village was provided. A steep [[cable railway|incline]] dropped from the mineral line east of Abergynolwyn station to the village below, where a series of tram lines radiated. Coal, building materials and general goods were delivered down the incline and the contents of the village [[cesspit]]s were hauled back up for disposal along the lineside.<ref name=Boyd6571/>

The railway used [[steam locomotive]]s from the start, unlike its neighbour the horse-drawn Corris Railway. The original two engines, although of entirely different design, were both purchased from [[Fletcher, Jennings & Co.]] of [[Whitehaven]] in [[Cumbria]],<ref>Rolt 1965, pages 82<U+2013>83</ref> and both are still in service, 140&nbsp;years on, although so many of their parts have been replaced down the years that much of their present-day component metal is not original. The Talyllyn's rare gauge is thought to have been adopted to match that of the Corris Railway,<ref>Rolt 1998, pages 5<U+2013>6</ref> and the line's two original steam locomotives were among the earliest engines built for such a narrow gauge. No.&nbsp;1 ''[[Talyllyn (locomotive)|Talyllyn]]'' is an [[0-4-2]]ST ([[Tank locomotive#Saddle tank|saddle tank]]) and No.&nbsp;2 ''[[Dolgoch (locomotive)|Dolgoch]]'' is an [[0-4-0]]WT ([[well tank]]). The line carried slate from the quarry to the wharf at Tywyn and general goods along its length. Public passenger trains initially ran between Abergynolwyn, Dolgoch and Pendre stations only; quarrymen were carried on unofficial trains that continued on from Abergynolwyn to the foot of the Alltwyllt incline in Nant Gwernol gorge.<ref name=Boyd6571/>

The line operated successfully during its early years, serving the quarry and the local district. By 1880, Bryn Eglwys employed 300&nbsp;workers and was producing {{convert|8000|long ton}} of finished slate per year, all shipped via the railway.<ref name=AJR195/> Passenger traffic was substantial, rising from 11,500&nbsp;passengers carried in 1867 to over 23,000 (roughly equivalent to 40,000&nbsp;passenger journeys) in 1877.<ref>Boyd 1965, page 118</ref>

=== Declining fortunes: 1880s<U+2013>1910===
[[Image:TalyllynAtNantGwernol1890.jpg|thumb|right|''Talyllyn'' at the foot of the Alltwyllt incline, the present site of Nant Gwernol station, 1890]]
From the 1880s onwards the "[[Corris Railway Grand Tour|Grand Tour]]" was a popular option with tourists. This used [[charabanc]]s to link the Talyllyn and Corris railways via Tal-y-llyn Lake and Cadair Idris, returning on [[Cambrian Railways]] trains.<ref>Rolt 1998, pages 24<U+2013>25</ref>  The last two decades of the 19th century saw a decline in the demand for slate and many smaller quarries fell on hard times, including Bryn Eglwys, where by 1890 production had halved to {{convert|4000|long ton}} a year.<ref name=AJR195/> In 1896, production at the [[Penrhyn Quarry]] in north Wales, one of the largest producers of slate, was stopped due to labour disputes, resulting in a temporary increase in demand at other quarries.  McConnel expanded production at Bryn Eglwys to take advantage of the sudden demand, but only with the aim of maximising profits during the remainder of his lease, which was to expire in 1910. He built new trial levels without proper provision for the removal of [[overburden]] and pushed the limits of safe working in the existing chambers. As McConnel's lease drew to its close, there was no prospect of a further lessee coming forward and work began on dismantling the quarry's equipment.<ref name=Boyd6572/>

=== Haydn Jones era: 1911<U+2013>1950 ===

The Bryn Eglwys quarry was the primary employer in the Abergynolwyn district, so its closure caused significant distress. Local landowner [[Henry Haydn Jones]] purchased the company in 1910, the same year he was elected the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] for [[Merionethshire|Merioneth]], and reopened the quarry in January 1911.<ref name=Boyd6572>Boyd 1965, pages 72<U+2013>73</ref>  He did not have any capital to invest in the quarry, however, and the first workings reopened were on the "Broad Vein", which yielded relatively hard slate that was less popular and harder to sell. The lack of an available market for this output forced the quarry to switch to extracting softer slate from the "Narrow Vein" but, because Haydn Jones could not afford to open new workings into the Narrow Vein, he resorted to the dangerous practice of narrowing the columns that supported the roofs of the underground chambers. This practice had begun under McConnel's ownership and Haydn Jones continued it throughout his ownership of the quarry.<ref name=Boyd6572/> A brief construction boom after the [[First World War]] saw production return to around {{convert|4000|long ton}} per year.<ref name=AJR195/>

The 1920s also saw an upsurge in holiday traffic, as Britain recovered from the war and tourism gained in popularity. The Talyllyn saw summer passenger numbers grow significantly and regularly had to supplement its formal passenger stock with slate wagons fitted with planks as seats.<ref>Ransom 1996, page 130</ref> An unusual tourist service offered by the railway was to hire a slate wagon, which would be left at Abergynolwyn. At the end of the day the tourists would return to Tywyn in the wagon, powered by [[Gravity railway|gravity]]. This service was discontinued in the early 1930s.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 116<U+2013>117</ref> The additional income from the tourist trade defrayed some of the costs of operating the railway, but never enough for it to make a profit during Haydn Jones' ownership.

The lease on Bryn Eglwys expired in 1942, but was extended on an annual basis. In 1946 the weakened columns gave way in a significant collapse and the quarry was deemed unsafe and closed immediately.  Haydn Jones had promised to continue operating the railway as long as he was alive and so, despite the closure of the quarry, the railway continued to run trains on a shoestring budget. In 1947 the British railway system was nationalised and the Talyllyn was one of the few operating railways not included. The reasons for this are unclear, but it is significant that all official mention of the railway had ceased several decades before and it is likely that the line was simply forgotten by officialdom.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 73<U+2013>74</ref>  Between 1947 and 1949 the railway ran a passenger service two days a week. On [[2 July]] [[1950]] Haydn Jones died and closure of the railway seemed inevitable, but the line continued to operate for the remainder of the summer season, ending on [[6 October]].<ref>Boyd 1965, page 74</ref>

==Preservation==
=== Rescue: 1951<U+2013>1960 ===
[[Image:Tal-Y-Llyn Dolgoch Abergwynolwn 1951.jpg|thumb|right|Locomotive No. 2 ''Dolgoch'' at Abergynolwyn in 1951, early in the preservation era]]
During the [[Second World War]] and in the period immediately afterwards several [[railfan|enthusiasts]], particularly from the [[Birmingham]] area, had become aware of the narrow gauge railways of Wales and there had been suggestions that one of the lines, most probably the [[Ffestiniog Railway]], could be saved. In the summer of 1950, [[L. T. C. Rolt|Tom Rolt]] wrote a letter to the [[Birmingham Post]] newspaper suggesting that a rescue of the Talyllyn be undertaken. He received sufficient positive response for a meeting of interested enthusiasts to be held on [[11 October]] [[1950]] at the Imperial Hotel in Birmingham. Around 70&nbsp;people attended the meeting and Rolt proposed the formation of a committee to look into the acquisition of the railway. With the support of the meeting, the committee met for the first time on [[23 October]] and immediately entered into negotiation with Haydn Jones' executors.<ref>Rolt 1965, pages 52<U+2013>53</ref>

The transfer of ownership to the committee was legally complex, but both parties agreed that all shares in the railway company would be transferred from Haydn Jones' estate to a new company called Talyllyn Holdings Ltd., whose board consisted of two directors from the executors and two from the committee. The transfer took place on [[8 February]] [[1951]], at which point the newly formed Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society effectively took control of the railway. The Society immediately began to publicise its efforts, hoping to raise funds and find further volunteers to help reopen the railway, and by May nearly 650&nbsp;members had joined the society.<ref>Rolt 1965, pages 54<U+2013>55</ref>  The railway re-opened under the control of the Society for the first time on the [[Whit Monday]] bank holiday, [[14 May]] [[1951]],<ref>Potter, page 78</ref> with trains running between Wharf and Rhydyronen stations. Regular trains began to run on [[4 June]] and continued through the summer.<ref>Rolt 1965, page 56</ref>

In the early years of preservation, the line struggled to operate using the original rolling stock. When the line was taken over in 1950 ''Dolgoch'' was the only operating locomotive and it was apparent that it was in need of a major overhaul. To enable operations to continue two further steam locomotives, Nos.&nbsp;3 and 4, were purchased from the recently closed Corris Railway in 1951 and named ''Sir Haydn'' and ''Edward Thomas'' respectively. Because both railways were built to the unusual gauge of {{RailGauge|27}} it was relatively easy to adapt the Corris locomotives to work on the Talyllyn. No.&nbsp;3 became the first new locomotive to travel on the railway for over 90&nbsp;years in 1951, but it frequently [[Derailment|derailed]], and on inspection it turned out that the Talyllyn track was laid approximately half an inch (13&nbsp;mm) wider than the official gauge, a deliberate policy by the old company to accommodate the long [[wheelbase]] of ''Talyllyn''. Both ''Talyllyn'' and ''Dolgoch'' had unusually wide wheel treads that allowed them to stay on the wide-of-gauge track. This problem was eventually cured by relaying the railway to its correct gauge and altering ''Talyllyn'''s trailing wheels to allow them to swivel horizontally, shortening the locomotive's fixed wheelbase.<ref>Boyd 1988, page 260</ref> No.&nbsp;4 was unserviceable when it arrived, but John Alcock,<ref>Rolt 1998, picture facing page 109</ref> the chairman of the [[Hunslet Engine Company]], was a member of the Preservation Society and had No.&nbsp;4 overhauled free of charge at his works.<ref>Johnson 1997, page 57</ref>

[[Image:Tivedshambo 2008-03-18 NGRM Guinness loco.jpg|thumb|left|The Guinness brewery locomotive, the first exhibit donated to the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum]]
Another early addition to the locomotive fleet was No.&nbsp;6 ''Douglas'', donated to the society by the Birmingham engineering firm Abelsons Ltd. This locomotive was built for the [[British military narrow gauge railways|depot railway]] serving [[RAF Calshot]] where it worked until 1945, and, after rebuilding from its original {{RailGauge|2ft}} gauge, it entered service in 1954.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 99<U+2013>100</ref>  Through the 1950s the volunteers and staff members of the TRPS rebuilt the line and rescued it from its state of decay, during a period characterised by a "[[Boy's Own Paper|''Boy's Own'' comic]] spirit of adventure, involving enthusiasm, ingenuity and a fair degree of irresponsibility".<ref>Goddin 2002, page 46</ref>

On [[22 May]] [[1957]] the [[BBC]] produced a live [[Outside broadcasting|outside broadcast]] from the railway, during which [[Wynford Vaughan Thomas]] and [[Huw Weldon]] commentated on a trip from Dolgoch to Abergynolwyn. The publicity from this broadcast drew substantial numbers of visitors to the railway that summer, with more than 57,500&nbsp;passengers carried, and this increase in revenue in turn enabled the railway to continue to improve its infrastructure and provide tourists with a better experience.<ref>Rolt 1965, pages 61<U+2013>62</ref>  The following year locomotive No.&nbsp;1 ''Talyllyn'' returned to steam after an extensive overhaul.<ref>Mitchell and Eyres, 2005 page 25</ref>

An important development during this period was the establishment of the [[Narrow Gauge Railway Museum]] at Tywyn Wharf station. The first exhibit for what was to become the museum was a locomotive donated in 1952 by [[Diageo|Guinness]] from their recently closed [[St. James's Gate Brewery]] railway. In 1954 the Preservation Society agreed to start work on a formal museum and exhibits from around the United Kingdom were acquired to form the nucleus of the collection. In 1955 work started on converting the old [[gunpowder magazine|gunpowder store]] at Wharf station into a temporary museum building, and in 1956 the first exhibit arrived at Tywyn.<ref>Rolt 1965, pages 112<U+2013>114</ref>

=== Securing the infrastructure: 1960<U+2013>1969 ===
[[Image:Tywyn Wharf layout 1964.svg|thumb|right|Tywyn Wharf station in 1964, after layout improvements]]

The 1960s proved to be a decade of consolidation for the Talyllyn. Pendre works underwent several much-needed expansions, adding additional covered storage for carriages and more workshop room. Modern machine tools, along with proper lighting and a new power supply were added. Substantial improvements to Tywyn Wharf station were also made, along with continued relaying and upgrading of the track to Abergynolwyn.<ref>Bate 2001, chapter 5</ref>  Passenger numbers continued to climb after the BBC broadcast of 1957; in 1960, 67,000&nbsp;passenger journeys were made, increasing to 78,500 in 1964.<ref>Rolt 1965, page 99</ref> In response to this growing popularity the railway undertook a programme of new rolling stock construction.

By the early 1960s Tywyn Wharf station was in need of major improvements. Before preservation, the station had contained only a fan of sidings, which meant that there was no way for the locomotive of an arriving train to run round the carriages. As a result, trains were pushed from behind as far as Pendre, where the locomotive could be moved past the carriages to the front of the train. A [[passing loop|loop]] was installed at Wharf for the first time in August 1952, to avoid having to propel trains to Pendre,<ref name=Boyd6577>Boyd 1965, page 77</ref> but in the winter of 1964/65 a major upgrade of the station was carried out. This improved the track layout and extended the original office building to provide covered accommodation for passengers and a shop.<ref>Mitchell and Eyres, 2005 page 19</ref>

As passenger numbers continued to grow during the late 1960s it became clear that further motive power was needed, especially as the rebuilt No.&nbsp;1 was not performing well. The Talyllyn's unusual track gauge and restricted loading gauge meant that it was unlikely that a locomotive could be found that could work on the line unaltered,<ref>Mitchell and Eyres, 2005 page 87</ref> so in 1969 a {{RailGauge|3ft}} gauge steam locomotive was purchased from the [[Bord na Mona]] (Irish Peat Board) with a view to rebuilding it for use on the Talyllyn. This locomotive was unofficially known as ''Irish Pete'', a nod to its original use.<ref>Bate 2001, page 155</ref>

=== Extension to Nant Gwernol: 1969<U+2013>1980 ===
[[Image:Tivedshambo 2008-03-18 Alltwyllt incline.jpg|thumb|right|The head of the Alltwyllt incline at the end of the Nant Gwernol extension in 2008]]
The preservation society had long held ambitions to extend the railway along the former mineral extension from Abergynolwyn to the foot of the Alltwyllt incline, and as early as 1959 work had begun to trace the owners of the land that the extension traversed. Planning began in the mid-1960s, but construction did not start until 1968 when the winding house for the Abergynolwyn village incline was demolished.<ref name=Thomas34>Thomas 2002, page 34</ref> To bring the line up to passenger standards some of the curves needed to be eased, and this required blasting work, as the line runs on a narrow ledge on the hillside at this point.<ref>Bate 2001, page 181</ref>  The extension and new station at Nant Gwernol were opened on [[22 May]] [[1976]] by Wynford Vaughan Thomas who drove in the ceremonial "[[golden spike]]" to complete the extension.<ref>Bate 2001, page 184<U+2013>185</ref> Despite this official opening ceremony, minor work still remained to bring the extension to the standard required to run regular passenger trains, but regular train services began on [[29 May]] [[1976]].<ref>Bate 2001, page 189</ref> 

[[Image:Tivedshambo 2008-03-18 Nant Gwernol footbridge.jpg|thumb|left|The footbridge across the Nant Gwernol]]
Although the extension of the railway was completed in 1976, work in the vicinity continued with the creation of footpaths connecting to the new station. A new footbridge was built crossing the Nant Gwernol gorge and connecting the station with the existing path on the east side of the river. The bridge and paths were opened on [[3 May]] [[1980]] by [[Gordon Parry, Baron Parry|Lord Parry]], the chairman of the [[Visit Wales|Wales Tourist Board]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Railway Times |pages=page 11 |volume=18 |title=Narrow Gauge News-Centre |month=June |year=1980}}</ref>  By the mid-1970s, it had become clear that passenger numbers were no longer increasing.  After 1973, the peak year for passengers on the Talyllyn with 186,000&nbsp;passenger journeys made,<ref>Bate 2001, page 169</ref> numbers were to decline consistently until the 1990s.<ref name=Thomas35/>  Preliminary work on the conversion of ''Irish Pete'' for use on the Talyllyn, which had begun in the early 1970s, was put on hold in 1975 and the chassis and boiler were put into storage at Pendre.<ref>Bate 2001, page 234</ref>

=== Consolidation: 1980<U+2013>2001 ===
[[Image:Tivedshambo 2005-07-16 Tom Rolt.jpg|thumb|right|Locomotive No. 7 ''Tom Rolt'' at Tywyn Wharf station]]
With passenger numbers falling and the line extended to Nant Gwernol, the railway entered a period of consolidation.  By 1987, the [[boiler]] on locomotive No. 6 ''Douglas'' was life expired and in need of replacement. Consideration was given to reviving the project to build a new locomotive from the components of ''Irish Pete'' instead of purchasing a new boiler for ''Douglas'' and in early 1988 work recommenced on the rebuilding of the ex-Bord na Mona locomotive. A new design for a 0-4-2 side tank locomotive was prepared by the railway's Chief Engineer John Bate, which reused the chassis and boiler from the locomotive with a new superstructure and the addition of trailing wheels, and the new locomotive, officially named ''Tom Rolt'' after the Preservation Society's first chairman, was put into service on [[6 May]] [[1991]].<ref>Bate 2001, pages 234<U+2013>237</ref>  During this period further expansions of both Tywyn Wharf and Pendre stations were undertaken and Abergynolwyn station, which had been rebuilt as part of the Nant Gwernol extension in the 1970s, was expanded further to provide an additional attraction at the eastern end of the line.<ref name=Thomas35>Thomas 2002, page 35</ref>

One major anomaly remained in the railway's operations: the 1889 [[Regulation of Railways Act 1889|Regulation of Railways Act]] had required, amongst other measures, that all British passenger trains be fitted with [[Brake_%28railway%29#Continuous brakes|continuous brakes]]. McConnel had secured an exemption for the Talyllyn Railway, on the basis that the low speed of operation meant they were unnecessary and that the cost of compliance would bankrupt the enterprise, but by the end of the 1990s the [[HM Railway Inspectorate|Railway Inspectorate]] was insisting that the Talyllyn be brought into compliance with the act, a little over 100&nbsp;years after it had passed. By 2001, the railway had fitted its entire passenger fleet with the necessary equipment, operated by [[Air brake (rail)|air brake pumps]] mounted on the locomotives.<ref name=Thomas35/>

=== New museum: 2001<U+2013>present ===

The Preservation Society celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2001, and as part of the year of celebrations a major new project was launched to once more extend and improve facilities at Tywyn Wharf station. For many years the station had been home to semi-permanent buildings housing the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum, but the new plans for the station included the construction of a new two-storey building to house the museum and the extension of the existing station building to house a new cafe and booking office. Work began on the first phase of the project in January 2002.<ref name=Thomas35/>  In 2003 the railway received a <U+00A3>682,500 [[National Lottery#'Good causes'|Heritage Lottery]] grant towards the <U+00A3>1,170,000 cost of redeveloping Wharf station,<ref name=BBC2003>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/2847945.stm |title=Facelift for 'Thomas' station|accessdate=2008-03-15 |publisher=BBC News |year=2003 |accessdate=2008-03-16 }}</ref> and the new station and museum were officially opened by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Camilla, The Duchess of Cornwall|The Duchess of Cornwall]] on [[13 July]] [[2005]].

The Talyllyn Railway remains a successful and popular tourist attraction. The original 1860s locomotives and passenger stock still run regularly alongside the roster of more modern rolling stock. The railway is promoted as one of ''The Great Little Trains of Wales'', a joint marketing scheme launched in 1970 that encompasses nine narrow gauge railways in the country, mostly found in north and mid Wales.<ref> Bate 2001, page 157</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatlittletrainsofwales.co.uk|title=The Great Little Trains of Wales website |accessdate=2008-04-06 |author=Yarborough, Bruce |publisher= Great Little Trains of Wales}}</ref> In 2006, nearly 51,000&nbsp;passengers were carried.<ref name=Report2006/>

In 2003 the railway employed 13 full-time staff, plus the equivalent of an extra six part-time staff in the summer and some 350&nbsp;volunteers.<ref name=BBC2003/>

===Special events===

The railway operates a programme of special events throughout the year. These include the Tom Rolt Steam and Vintage Rally, children's Duncan Days and Tywyn Victorian week. Since 1984 there has been an annual running event called Race the Train, which follows the railway track 7<U+00BC>&nbsp;miles (11.8&nbsp;km) from Tywyn to Abergynolwyn and back again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racethetrain.com/|title=Race the Train website |accessdate=2008-04-06 |publisher=Tywyn Rotary Club}}</ref> The challenge is for runners to complete the 14<U+00BD>-mile (23.3&nbsp;km) cross country route faster than the train, which takes around 1&nbsp;hour 45&nbsp;minutes.

===Young Members Group===

The Young Members Group (YMG) are the members of the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society between the ages of 14 and 25. On occasions during the peak season, the Talyllyn Railway has held a Young Members Day in which the youngest qualified people available that day run the railway.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talyllyn.co.uk/news/default/events/20050906_Young_Members_Day_Saturday_August_27th.html |title=Talyllyn website report on Young Members day |accessdate=2007-08-27 |publisher=Talyllyn Railway Company |author=Knapton, Paul }}</ref>

===Original passenger line===
[[Image:Tivedshambo 2008-03-18 Wharf layout.jpg|thumb|Tywyn Wharf station, 2008]]
The main terminus of the line is at {{stnlnk|Tywyn Wharf}} (originally known as King's Station, after a local landowner), where the railway's administrative headquarters and the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum are located. When the line carried traffic from the quarry, slates were transferred to the [[Cambrian Railway]] on the [[transhipment]] sidings.  Leaving Wharf station, which stands at an elevation of 40&nbsp;ft (12&nbsp;m) above sea level, the line passes immediately under the A493 [[Machynlleth]] to [[Dolgellau]] road and enters a long [[Cutting (transportation)|cutting]] that climbs towards {{stnlnk|Pendre}}, at a maximum [[Grade (slope)#Railways|gradient]] of 1 in 60. On the left (north) side of the cutting there was once a long siding used for gravity [[Shunt (railway operations)|shunting]] of wagons into the sidings at Wharf station. The railway runs through the cutting for about half a mile (800&nbsp;m), before passing under another road bridge and passing the [[Motive power depot|locomotive and carriage sheds]] and works at Pendre.<ref name=Boyd6577/>

[[Image:Tivedshambo 2008-03-18 TR No 4 in Fathew Valley.jpg|thumb|left|A Talyllyn Railway train climbing eastwards along the Fathew Valley between Brynglas and Dolgoch]]
From Pendre, the railway passes over a gated [[level crossing]] and runs beside an industrial estate before climbing up to Ty Mawr bridge and on to Hendy, the first of five [[Minor halts on the Talyllyn Railway|minor halts]], which serves the adjacent farm. The railway runs in an approximately north-easterly direction along the [[River Fathew|Fathew]] valley, mainly through fields of local farms on the valley floor, although this is where some of the steepest gradients on the line are to be found.<ref name=Potter226>Potter, page 226</ref> The [[ruling gradient]] of the line is 1 in 60.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talyllyn.co.uk/history.html|title=Talyllyn Railway history |accessdate=2008-04-06 |publisher=Talyllyn Railway Company}}</ref>

More local halts follow at Fach Goch, and Cynfal, the latter having a small platform.<ref name=Potter226/> The section from Cynfal to {{stnlnk|Rhydyronen}} was relaid in 1951 using rail purchased from the Corris Railway after the latter line's closure in 1948, and is therefore known informally as the Corris Straight.<ref>Rolt 1965, page 43</ref>  Rhydyronen, now a [[request stop]], was the first intermediate station built on the line, opening in 1867. A siding at the station was removed in 1957.<ref>Potter, page 227</ref>  A short steep climb under a road bridge follows the station, followed by a slight downhill gradient. Unlike the Ffestiniog Railway, the Talyllyn was not designed to be worked as a gravity line, however this is the only downhill section between Pendre and Nant Gwernol.<ref>Potter, page 228</ref> Another minor halt follows at Tynllwynhen, before the passing loop and station at {{stnlnk|Brynglas}}.

<!--[[Image:DolgochStation1894.jpg|thumb|right|Dolgoch station in 1894]] Image commented out pending verification of public domain status -->
[[Image:DolgochStation.JPG|thumb|right|Dolgoch station in 2006]]
Above Brynglas, the line crosses the Cwm Pandy stream and enters a shallow cutting, climbing as it goes. The cutting ends at a road overbridge after which the line runs through open countryside as it starts to ascend the valley side on a ledge. After approximately a quarter of a mile (400&nbsp;m) it enters woodlands west of {{stnlnk|Dolgoch}}, climbing steadily, then curves to the south east and crosses the Dolgoch gorge on the Dolgoch viaduct, which carries the line {{ft to m|51|abbr=yes}} above the Dolgoch ravine.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 82<U+2013>83</ref>  Dolgoch station is immediately east of the viaduct, situated on a left-hand curve at {{ft to m|187|abbr=yes}} above sea level, and is the main intermediate station on the line, being popular with tourists visiting the nearby [[waterfall|falls]]. The railway continues in a north easterly direction, curving through the woods and climbing the valley side. It shortly passes Quarry Siding, where a halt and passing loop are located, as well as a small [[shale]] quarry, the rock from which is mainly used for [[Track ballast|ballasting]] on the railway. The line continues its ascent towards [[Abergynolwyn railway station|Abergynolwyn station]], situated on a ledge cut into the hillside.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 83<U+2013>84</ref>

===Abergynolwyn to Nant Gwernol===
[[Image:Abergynolwyn Village Incline Map.svg|thumb|Map of the Abergynolwyn Village Branch]]
The original terminus of the statutory railway was Abergynolwyn, beyond which the railway continued as a mineral extension, now converted for passenger use. The extension was originally sharply curved, as the line turns south east into the steeply sided Nant Gwernol gorge but these curves were eased when conversion for passenger use took place in 1976. The whole section is within woods, now owned by the [[Forestry Commission]].  Shortly after leaving Abergynolwyn station the line reaches Ty Dwr, where the original locomotive shed stood from 1865 until it was demolished after Pendre works opened in 1867, although the slate water tower continued in use into the 1950s.<ref>Mitchell and Eyres 2005, page 70</ref>

About half way along the {{convert|0.75|mi|km}} extension is the site of the Village Incline. From here the line runs into the gorge, high above the river on a narrow ledge, ending at the foot of the first incline leading to the Bryn Eglwys quarry. The original line fanned out into a set of three sidings, used to marshal trains of loaded slate wagons coming down from the quarry and empty wagons waiting to ascend.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 84<U+2013>86</ref>  [[Nant Gwernol railway station|Nant Gwernol station]], the eastern terminus of the line, was built on the site of the sidings.

[[Image:VillageIncline.jpg|thumb|left|The village incline from the north west, around 1880]]
The village of [[Abergynolwyn]] was built to house the quarrymen of Bryn Eglwys and their families, and to serve the village an [[Cable railway|incline]] and short branch were laid from a point about half way along the mineral extension. The winding house for the incline stood on the narrow ledge, with the mineral line passing through it. The two-track incline dropped 150&nbsp;ft (46&nbsp;m) over a distance of 363&nbsp;ft (111&nbsp;m). At its foot, the line crossed the Nant Gwernol on a girder bridge. Immediately after the bridge, short lines branched off to the east from a wagon [[Turntable (railroad)|turntable]] to the coal yard and smithy of Pandy Farm and west to a [[slate (writing)|writing slate]] factory (later a carpenter's yard). The main branch then split to form a storage loop, with a further wagon turntable and a longer branch serving the houses and school to the north east. The main branch continued north, crossing the main road then passing between the two main terraces in the village before ending in a turntable and a final short line connecting to the Capel Jerusalem chapel.<ref>Boyd 1988, page 153<U+2013>162</ref>  The village incline was lifted during the early years of preservation, to provide much needed rail to replace the existing track.<ref>Potter, page 126</ref> The winding house was demolished in 1968 to allow realignment of the railway to form the extension to Nant Gwernol.<ref name=Thomas34/>

=== Galltymoelfre Tramway ===
[[Image:Tivedshambo 2008-03-18 Cantrybedd incline.jpg|thumb|upright|The Cantrybedd incline at the end of the Galltymoelfre Tramway]]
Until the closure of the quarries in 1946, the line east from Abergynolwyn was worked as a mineral tramway <U+2013> only slate and goods trains serving Bryn Eglwys ran on this section. The quarry lay about a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) south-east of Nant Gwernol station and 300&nbsp;ft (100&nbsp;m) above it, with a further mineral tramway connecting the quarry with the railway.<ref name=Boyd88165/>  What is now Nant Gwernol station was the terminus of the Talyllyn Railway proper. Here the line fanned out into a set of sidings where inbound trains were left and outbound slate trains assembled. The sidings were located on a narrow ledge in the side of the Nant Gwernol gorge. 

Rising south-east from the end of the sidings was the {{ft to m|633|abbr=yes}} long, double track gravity operated, Alltwyllt incline,<ref>Boyd 1988, page 162</ref> from the top of which the Galltymoelfre Tramway ran south-east towards the quarry for about {{convert|0.5|mi|m}}. The tramway was laid in light [[Rail_profile#History|bridge rail]] and worked for its entire existence using horses. The tramway ended at the foot of the Cantrybedd Incline, a {{ft to m|440|abbr=yes}} long double track, gravity operated incline. This final incline rose to the north edge of Bryn Eglwys quarry, reaching a height of {{ft to m|612|abbr=yes}} above sea level.<ref name=Boyd88165>Boyd 1988, page 165</ref>

==Operation==
{{See also|Talyllyn Railway rolling stock}}
The line has six steam locomotives for passenger trains and four diesel locomotives, which are primarily used to haul works trains. It is unusual for all steam locomotives to be operable at the same time, as at least one is normally scheduled for overhaul.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talyllyn.co.uk/news/default/20070829_100_Availability.html|title=Talyllyn website - 100% availability |publisher=Talyllyn Railway Company |accessdate=2008-04-06 |author=Higginson, Karen }}</ref> The railway also owns 23&nbsp;carriages and vans, including all of the original carriages and the brake van built for the railway.

[[Image:214654 b60bcd8d.jpg|thumb|left|''Dolgoch'' at Brynglas level crossing]]
The railway is [[Single track (rail)|single track]], so special measures have to be taken to prevent collisions. Before preservation, the railway operated a "[[Safeworking#One Engine in Steam|one engine in steam]]" policy, but with growing passenger numbers it became necessary to install passing loops and a more stringent method of single line control was introduced.<ref>Potter, pages 130<U+2013>131</ref> The line is worked by [[Token (railway signalling)|token]]s, which authorise the driver to enter a single line section, and these are interlocked to prevent more than one token being withdrawn for a section at any one time. A loop is at Pendre, which was used from the opening of the railway for shunting purposes, and further loops were installed at Brynglas in 1953 and Quarry Siding in 1963.<ref>Potter, pages 132<U+2013>133</ref> When the Nant Gwernol extension opened in 1976, Abergynolwyn also became a passing loop.

Each passing loop is controlled by a small [[signal box]], known as a block-post. These house the lever frames that control the points, the token equipment and telephones. The railway has few signals; instead it has stop boards at each loop, and the [[Signalman (rail)|blockman]] allows trains to proceed by use of flags.<ref>Potter, page 222</ref> When the block-post is unstaffed, it is the responsibility of the locomotive crew to change the token before proceeding.<ref>Rolt 1965, page 102</ref>

==In fiction==
The Talyllyn Railway is represented in the ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine]]'' books as the [[Skarloey Railway]], with most of the fictional locomotives being based on real-life equivalents. The author, [[W.V. Awdry|Rev. W. Awdry]], visited the line on a family holiday in the early days of preservation and became involved as a volunteer soon afterwards. Several of the stories in ''[[The Railway Series]]'' come from real-life experiences at the Talyllyn, and a number of the books contain full-page illustrations of Talyllyn locomotives.<ref>Potter, page 89</ref>

The preservation of the Talyllyn Railway by volunteers was the inspiration for the 1953 film ''[[The Titfield Thunderbolt]]'',<ref>Huntley 1969, page 77</ref> an [[Ealing Studios]] comedy about a group of villagers attempting to run a service on a disused [[branch line]] after closure. [[T. E. B. Clarke]], the script writer for the film, had heard about the preservation of the Talyllyn and spent a day on the railway in 1951, and some of the early incidents in preservation were incorporated into the film. In the book ''Railway Adventure'' Tom Rolt recalled that he had hoped the film might be produced on the Talyllyn,<ref>Rolt 1998 page 115</ref> but in the end it was filmed on the recently closed [[Bristol and North Somerset Railway]] branch line along the [[Cam Brook, Somerset|Cam Brook]] valley in [[Somerset]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/BathNES/environmentandplanning/landandpremises/Landscape/rlculturalperceptions.htm|title=Cultural Perceptions of the Landscape|publisher=Bath & North East Somerset Council|accessdate=2008-06-05|date=2008-04-25|author=Matthew Hawkins}}</ref>
