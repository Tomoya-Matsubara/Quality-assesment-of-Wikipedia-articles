{{Suicide}}

'''Suicide''' ([[Latin]] ''suicidium'', from ''sui caedere'', "to kill oneself") is the act of intentionally causing one's own [[death]]. Suicide is often committed out of [[Despair (emotion)|despair]], or attributed to some underlying [[mental disorder]] which includes [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], [[alcoholism]] and [[drug abuse]].<ref name="Hawton, van Heeringen 2009">{{cite journal |author=Hawton K, van Heeringen K |title=Suicide |journal=Lancet |volume=373 |issue=9672 |pages=1372<U+2013>81 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19376453 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60372-X}}</ref> Pressures or misfortunes such as [[financial difficulties]] or troubles with [[interpersonal relationship]]s may play a significant role.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uvm.edu/~fmagdoff/PrecariousExistence.pdf |title=www.uvm.edu |format=PDF}}</ref>

Over one million people die by suicide every year.  The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates that it is the thirteenth-leading cause of death worldwide<ref>Bruce Gross, Forrensic Examiner, Summer, 2006</ref> and the National Safety Council rates it sixth in the United States.<ref>[http://www.nsc.org/news_resources/injury_and_death_statistics/Pages/TheOddsofDyingFrom.aspx see the PDF]</ref> It is a leading cause of death among teenagers and adults under 35.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1071203.html |title=CIS: UN Body Takes On Rising Suicide Rates <U+2013> Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty 2006}}</ref><ref name= understanding_suicidal_behaviour_a02>{{Cite book |last1=O'Connor |first1=Rory |last2=Sheehy |first2=Noel |title=Understanding suicidal behaviour |url=http://books.google.com/?id=79hEYGdDA3oC |date=29 Jan 2000 |publisher=BPS Books |location=Leicester |isbn=978-1-85433-290-5 |pages=33<U+2013>37}}</ref> The rate of suicide is far higher in men than in women, with males worldwide three to four times more likely to kill themselves than females.<ref>http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VB3OezIoI44C&pg=PA311&dq=rates+of+suicide+of+men+are+three+to+four+times+higher+than+for+women&hl=en&ei=ke2dTuiCAZH6sgaO9uj5CA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref><ref>Gelder et al, 2005 p169.

Views on suicide have been influenced by broader cultural views on existential themes such as [[religion]], [[honor]], and the [[meaning of life]]. The [[Abrahamic religion]]s consider suicide an [[sin|offense towards God]] due to religious belief in the [[sanctity of life]].  It was often regarded as a serious [[Legal views of suicide|crime]] and that view is common in modern Western thought.  Before the rise of [[Christianity]], suicide was not seen as automatically immoral in ancient [[Suicide in antiquity|Greek and Roman]] culture.  Conversely, during the [[samurai]] era in [[Japan]], [[seppuku]] was respected as a means of atonement for failure or as a form of protest. [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] is a [[Hindu]] [[funeral]] practice, now outlawed, in which the [[Widow#Widows_in_Indian_culture|widow]] was expected to [[self-immolation|immolate]] herself on her husband's funeral pyre, either willingly or under pressure from the family and in-laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/news/words/general/020807_witn.shtml |title=Indian woman commits sati suicide |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2002-08-07 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref>  In the 20th century, suicide in the form of [[self-immolation]] has been used as a form of protest, and in the form of [[kamikaze]] and [[suicide bombing]] as a military or terrorist tactic.

Medically [[assisted suicide]] ([[euthanasia]], or the [[right to die]]) is currently a controversial [[ethics|ethical issue]] involving people who are [[terminal illness|terminally ill]], in extreme pain, or have (perceived or construed) minimal quality of life through injury or illness. [[Self-sacrifice]] for others is not always considered suicide, as the goal is not to kill oneself but to save another; however, [[<U+00C9>mile Durkheim]]'s theory termed such acts "[[altruistic suicide]]."<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Death by hand grenade: altruistic suicide in combat.|publisher=Suicide Life Threat Behav.|date=1978 Spring|pages=46<U+2013>59|author=Blake JA|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/675772|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

==Classification==
===Self-harm===
{{Main|Self-harm}}
[[Self-harm]] is not a suicide attempt; however, initially self-harm was erroneously classified as a suicide attempt. There is a non-causal correlation between self-harm and suicide; both are most commonly a [[joint effect]] of [[clinical depression|depression]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rethink.org/living_with_mental_illness/coping_in_a_crisis/suicide_self_harm/self_harming/index.html |title=Rethink <U+2013> About self harm}}</ref> This may also be classified as Deliberate self-harm and is most common in younger people but has been increasing in recent years in people of all ages.<ref name="Gelder, Mayou 2005 Page 170">Gelder, Mayou, Geddes (2005). Psychiatry: Page 170. New York, NY; Oxford University Press Inc.</ref>

===Euthanasia and assisted suicide===
{{Main|Euthanasia}}
[[File:Euthanasia machine (Australia).JPG|thumb|[[Euthanasia machine]] invented by [[Philip Nitschke|Dr. Philip Nitschke]], on display at [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum, London]].]]
Individuals who wish to end their own lives may enlist the assistance of another person to achieve death. The other person, usually a family member or physician, may help carry out the act if the individual lacks the physical capacity to do so even with the supplied means. Assisted suicide is a contentious moral and political issue in many countries, as seen in the scandal surrounding [[Jack Kevorkian|Dr. Jack Kevorkian]], a [[physician|medical practitioner]] who supported [[euthanasia]], was found to have helped patients end their own lives, and was sentenced to prison time.

===Murder<U+2013>suicide===
{{Main|Murder<U+2013>suicide}}
A murder<U+2013>suicide is an act in which an individual kills one or more other persons immediately before or at the same time as him or herself.

The motivation for the murder in murder<U+2013>suicide can be purely criminal in nature or be perceived by the perpetrator as an act of care for loved ones in the context of severe [[clinical depression|depression]].

===Suicide attack===
{{Main|Suicide attack}}
A suicide attack is when an attacker perpetrates an act of violence against others, typically to achieve a military or political goal, which results in his or her own death as well. Suicide bombings are often regarded as an act of [[terrorism]]. Historical examples include the [[assassination]] of [[Alexander II of Russia|Czar Alexander II]] and the partly successful [[kamikaze]] attacks by Japanese air pilots during the [[Second World War]], as well as more recent attacks, such as the [[September 11th attacks]].

===Mass suicide===
{{Main|Mass suicide}}
Some suicides are done under [[peer pressure]] or as a group. Mass suicides can take place with as few as two people, in a "suicide pact", or with a larger number of people. An example is the mass suicide that took place by members of the [[Peoples Temple]], an [[United States|American]] [[cult]] led by [[Jim Jones]] in [[Guyana]] in 1978.

===Suicide pact===
{{Main|Suicide pact}}
A suicide pact describes the suicides of two or more individuals in an agreed-upon plan. The plan may be to die together, or separately and closely timed. Suicide pacts are generally distinct from mass suicide. The latter refers to incidents in which a larger number of people kill themselves together for the same ideological reason, often within a religious, political, military or paramilitary context. Suicide pacts, on the other hand, usually involve small groups of people (such as married or romantic partners, family members, or friends) whose motivations are intensely personal and individual.

The chart does not include all possible circumstances.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/suicide/datasources.html Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Suicide: Data Sources]</ref>]]
A number of factors are associated with the risk of suicide including: [[mental illness]], [[drug addiction]], availability of methods, family history, and socio-economic factors.<ref name=Lancet09>{{cite journal|last=Hawton|first=K|coauthors=van Heeringen, K|title=Suicide.|journal=Lancet|date=2009-04-18|volume=373|issue=9672|pages=1372<U+2013>81|pmid=19376453|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60372-X}}</ref> While external circumstances, such as a [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] event, may trigger suicide it does not seem to be an independent cause.

===Mental disorders===
[[Mental disorder]]s are frequently present at the time of suicide. It is estimated that from 87%<ref>{{cite journal |author=Arsenault-Lapierre G, Kim C, Turecki G |title=Psychiatric diagnoses in 3275 suicides: a meta-analysis |journal=BMC Psychiatry |volume=4 |page=37 |year=2004 |pmid=15527502 |pmc=534107 |doi=10.1186/1471-244X-4-37 |month=Nov |url= http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/4/37 |format=Free full text}}</ref> to 98% of suicide victims suffer from some type of mental disorder.<ref name=psyc2004>{{cite journal |author=Bertolote JM, Fleischmann A, De Leo D, Wasserman D |title= Psychiatric diagnoses and suicide: revisiting the evidence |journal=Crisis |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=147<U+2013>55 |year=2004 |pmid=15580849 |doi=10.1027/0227-5910.25.4.147 }}</ref> When broken down into type of mental disorder among suicides, [[mood disorders]] are present in 30%, [[substance abuse]] in 18%, [[schizophrenia]] in 14%, and [[personality disorders]] in 13% of suicides.<ref name=psyc2004/> About 5% of people with schizophrenia die of suicide.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Palmer BA, Pankratz VS, Bostwick JM |title=The lifetime risk of suicide in schizophrenia: a reexamination |journal=Arch.

Depression in the United States alone affects 17.6 million Americans each year or 1 in 6 people.  Within the next twenty years depression is expected to become the second leading cause of disability worldwide and the leading cause in high-income nations, including the United States.

===Substance abuse===
[[Substance abuse]] is the second most common [[risk factor]] for suicide after [[mood disorders]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=D., PhD Frank |first1=Jerome |last2=Levin |first2=Jerome D |last3=S., PhD Piccirilli |first3=Richard |last4=Perrotto |first4=Richard S |last5=Culkin |first5=Joseph |title=Introduction to chemical dependency counseling |url=http://books.google.com/?id=felzn3Ntd-cC&pg=RA1-PA151 |date=28 Sep 2001 |publisher=Jason Aronson |location=Northvale, NJ |isbn=978-0-7657-0289-0 |pages=150<U+2013>152}}</ref> Both chronic substance misuse as well as acute substance abuse are associated with suicide.

====Cocaine====
Misuse of drugs such as [[cocaine]] have a high correlation with suicide. Suicide is most likely to occur during the "crash" or withdrawal phase of cocaine in chronic cocaine-dependent users. Polysubstance misuse has been found to more often result in suicide in younger adults whereas suicide from alcoholism is more common in older adults. In [[San Diego]] it was found that 30% of suicides in people under the age of 30 had used cocaine. In [[New York City]] during a crack epidemic one in five people who committed suicide were found to have recently consumed cocaine. The "come down" or withdrawal phase from cocaine can result in intense depressive symptoms coupled with other distressing mental effects which contribute to the increased risk of suicide.<ref name=behavioral_integrative_care/><ref name=lexicon_of_psychiatry_neurology_and_neurosciences/>

An [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for suicide is that suicide may under some circumstances improve the reproductive success of relatives of the person committing suicide and thus also the overall reproductive success ([[inclusive fitness]]) of the person committing suicide. This may occur if the person committing suicide will not have more children (even if not committing suicide) and takes away resources from relatives by staying alive. This theory predicts that suicide may be especially likely if a person perceives that he or she is a burden to others, especially relatives, and with no hope of future improvement. In support of this several studies have found that perceived burdensomeness to others  is a strong predictor of suicidal thoughs, suicidality, lethality of suicide method, and successful suicide. Joiner et al. argue that there is also other research that is  be consistent with the theory such that "genuine suicide attempts were often characterize by a desire to make others better off, whereas nonsuicidal self-injury was often characterized by desires to express anger or punish oneself."  An objection is that while some suicides may increase the inclusive fitness of a person, in other cases, such as healthy adolescents committing suicide, this likely decrease overall reproductive success even if also including the reproductive success of relatives. A response is that such cases may be due malfunctioning psychological mechanisms (in the sense of increasing inclusive fitness). Evolutionary psychology argue that many human psychological features are [[adaptation]]s to the ancestral envrionment which was very different from the current one. Psychological mechanisms that may have usually increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment may not do so in today's environment.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070320}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1037/a0018413}}</ref>

The opposite of the Werther effect is the Papageno effect in which coverage of effective coping mechanisms, coping in adverse circumstances, as covered in the media about suicidal ideation, may have protective effects.

===Social===
====As a form of defiance or protest====
{{Globalize|section|date=May 2011 |discuss=Talk:Suicide#Hunger strike }}
In [[Ireland]] protesting via [[hunger strike]] to the death has been used as a tactic in recent times for political causes. During [[The Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]] a hunger strike was launched by the [[provisional IRA]] to demand that their prisoners be reclassified as [[prisoners of war]] rather than as [[terrorists]], during the infamous [[1981 Irish hunger strike|1981 hunger strikes]], led by [[Bobby Sands]]; this protest resulted in 10 deaths. The cause of death was recorded as "starvation, self-imposed" rather than suicide by the [[coroner]], modified to simply "starvation" on the death certificates after protests from the striker's families.<ref name=Philosophy59OKeeffe>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/3750951 Suicide and Self-Starvation], Terence M. O'Keeffe, [[Philosophy (journal)|''Philosophy'']], Vol. 59, No. 229 (Jul., 1984), pp. 349<U+2013>363</ref>

====Judicial suicide====
{{See also|murder<U+2013>suicide}}
A person who has committed a crime may commit suicide to avoid prosecution and disgrace, such as in [[murder<U+2013>suicide]]s. Nazi leader [[Hermann G<U+00F6>ring]], a high-ranked Nazi and head of the Luftwaffe, committed suicide with [[cyanide]] capsules rather than be hanged after his conviction at the [[Nuremberg Trials]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Telford |title=The Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |year=1992 |isbn=0394583558}}</ref> Some [[school shooting]]s, including the [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine]] and [[Virginia Tech massacre]]s, concluded with the perpetrators committing suicide.

====Military suicide====
{{Main|Suicide attack|:Category:Military personnel who committed suicide}}
[[File:USS White Plains attack by Tokkotai unit 25.10.1945 kk1a.jpg|thumb|A kamikaze attack on the escort carrier [[USS White Plains (CVE-66)|USS ''White Plains'']]]]
In the final days of World War II, some [[Japan]]ese pilots volunteered for [[kamikaze]] missions in an attempt to forestall defeat for the [[Empire of Japan]], while Japanese ground forces initiated [[banzai charge]]s. Near the end of WWII the Japanese designed the [[Ohka]], a small aircraft whose only purpose was kamikaze missions. Similarly, units of the Luftwaffe flew [[Selbstopfereinsatz]] (self-sacrifice missions) against Soviet bridges.

====Dutiful suicide====
Dutiful suicide is an act, or non-fatal attempt at the act, of fatal self-violence at one's own hands done in the belief that it will secure a greater good, rather than to escape harsh or impossible conditions. It can be voluntary, to relieve some dishonor or punishment, or imposed by threats of death or reprisals on one's family or reputation (a kind of murder by [[remote control]]). It can be culturally traditional or generally abhorred; it can be heavily ritualized as in seppuku or purely functional. Dutiful suicide can be distinguished from a kamikaze or suicide bomb attack, in which a fighter consumes his own life in delivering a weapon to the enemy.

Disgraced [[Nobiles|Roman aristocrats]] were sometimes allowed to commit suicide to spare themselves a trial and penalties against their families. An example of this was [[Emperor Nero]] who reportedly committed [[forced suicide]] facing a revolt and execution.<ref>Suetonius claims that Nero committed suicide in Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#49 49]; Sulpicius Severus, who possibly used Tacitus' lost fragments as a source, reports that is was uncertain whether Nero committed suicide, Sulpicius Severus, ''Chronica'' II.29, also see T.D. Barnes, "The Fragments of Tacitus' Histories", ''Classical Philology'' (1977), p.228</ref> A more modern case is [[Erwin Rommel]], who was found to have foreknowledge of the [[July 20 Plot]] on Hitler's life. Rommel was threatened with [[public trial]], execution and reprisals on his family unless he killed himself, which he did.<ref>{{cite book |last=Watson |first=Bruce |title=Exit Rommel: The Tunisian Campaign, 1942<U+2013>43 |publisher=Stackpole Books |year=2007 |page=170 |isbn=9780811733816}}</ref>

====Suicide as an escape====
In situations where continuing to live is intolerable, some people use suicide as a means of escape. Some inmates in [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[concentration camps]] are known to have killed themselves by deliberately touching the electrified fences.

As Germany faced inevitable defeat in mid<U+2013>1945, there were unprecedented waves of suicides amongst Germans in the final weeks of the war (see [[Mass suicides in 1945 Nazi Germany]]) These included many senior figures in the regime (e.g., [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Joseph Goebbels]]), as well as many ordinary people who were fearful of suffering atrocities at the hands of the advancing [[Red Army]].<ref>{{harvnb|Goeschel|2009|pp=158,162}}</ref> The behaviour of Soviet troops also played a role, as many Germans committed suicide to avoid rape or out of shame at having been raped.<ref>{{harvnb|Goeschel|2009|p=165}}</ref>

Emperor [[Tewodros II]] of Ethiopia, facing defeat at the hands of the [[1868 Expedition to Abyssinia|British expeditionary force]] committed suicide rather than be taken captive, announcing ""It is finished! Sooner than fall into his hands I will kill myself".<ref>{{cite book |author=Tareke, Gebru |title=The Ethiopian Revolution: War in the Horn of Africa |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |year=2009 |page=309 }}</ref>

According to a report by Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai, 150,000 debt-ridden farmers in [[India]] have committed suicide in the past decade.<ref>"[http://www.news24.com/World/News/Farmer-suicide-movie-slammed-20100819 Farmer suicide movie slammed]". News24. August 19, 2010</ref>

==Prevention==
{{Main|Suicide prevention}}
[[File:United States Army Suicide Prevention Poster.jpg|thumb|A United States Army [[suicide prevention]] poster]]
Suicide prevention is a term used for the collective efforts to reduce the incidence of suicide through prevention measures. Various strategies involving restricting the access to most common methods of suicide, such as firearms or toxic substances like pesticides, have proved to be effective in reducing suicide rates.
Studies supported by empirical data have indicated that that adequate prevention, diagnosis and treatment of depression and alcohol and substance abuse can reduce suicide rates, as well as follow-up contact with those who have made a suicide attempt.<ref>[http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/suicideprevent/en/ World Health Organization: Suicide prevention (SUPRE)]</ref>
While [[crisis hotline]]s are common there is little evidence to support or refute their effectiveness.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sakinofsky|first=I|title=The current evidence base for the clinical care of suicidal patients: strengths and weaknesses.|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry|date=2007 Jun|volume=52|issue=6 Suppl 1|pages=7S<U+2013>20S|pmid=17824349}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Suicide|url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/chapter3/sec5_1.html|work=The United States Surgeon General|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref>

The Best Practices Registry (BPR) For Suicide Prevention is a registry of various suicide intervention programs maintained by the American Association of Suicide Prevention.  The programs are divided, with those in Section I listing [[Evidence-based practice|evidence-based]] programs: interventions which have been subjected to indepth review and for which evidence has been proven that they demonstrated positive outcomes, those in Section III are programs which have been subjected to review.<ref>[http://www2.sprc.org/bpr/section-i-evidence-based-programs Best Practices Registry (BPR) For Suicide Prevention]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Rodgers PL, Sudak HS, Silverman MM, Litts DA |title=Evidence-based practices project for suicide prevention |journal=Suicide Life Threat Behav |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=154<U+2013>64 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17521269 |doi=10.1521/suli.2007.37.2.154 }}</ref>

===Screening===
The U.S. Surgeon General has suggested that screening to detect those at risk of suicide may be one of the most effective means of preventing suicide in children and adolescents.<ref>Office of the Surgeon General:The Surgeon General's Call To Action To Prevent Suicide 1999 [http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/calltoaction/calltoaction.htm]</ref>
There are various screening tools in the form of self-report [[questionnaire]]s to help identify those at risk such as the [[Beck Hopelessness Scale]] and [[Is Path Warm?]]. A number of these self-report questionnaires have been tested and found to be valid for use among adolescents and young adults.<ref>Rory C. O'Connor, Stephen Platt, Jacki Gordon: International Handbook of Suicide Prevention: Research, Policy and Practice, p. 510 [http://books.google.com/books?id=3fDGLWQtwFkC&pg=PA510&dq=suicide+screening&hl=en&ei=fYl1TsewCqbh0QHfpbnjDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CGUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=suicide%20screening&f=false]</ref> There is however a high rate of false-positive identification and those deemed to be at risk should ideally have a follow-up interview. The predictive quality of these screening  questionnaires has not been conclusively validated so it is not possible to determine if those identified at risk of suicide will actually commit suicide.<ref>Alan F. Schatzberg: The American Psychiatric Publishing textbook of mood disorders, p. 503: American Psychiatric Publishing; (2005)  ISBN 158562151X</ref> Asking about or screening for suicide does not appear to increase the risk.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Crawford|first=MJ|coauthors=Thana, L, Methuen, C, Ghosh, P, Stanley, SV, Ross, J, Gordon, F, Blair, G, Bajaj, P|title=Impact of screening for risk of suicide: randomised controlled trial.|journal=The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science|date=2011 May|volume=198|issue=5|pages=379<U+2013>84|pmid=21525521}}</ref>

In approximately 75% of completed suicides the individuals  had seen a physician within the prior year before their death, 45%-66% within the prior month.  Approximately 33% - 41% of those who completed suicide had contact with mental health services in the prior year, 20% within the prior month. These studies suggest an increased need for effective screening.<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/805459-overview Depression and Suicide Andrew B.

===Psychological===
There are various treatments utiizing psychological treatments such as [[dialectical behaviour therapy]] (DBT) in which multiple studies have reported varying degrees of clinical effectiveness from the use of DBT in reducing suicidality, including a reduction in self-harm behaviours and suicidal ideations.<ref>Canadian Agency for Drugs nd technology in Health: Dialectical Behaviour Therapy in Adolescents for Suicide Prevention: Systematic Review of Clinical-Effectiveness, CADTH Technology Overviews, Volume 1, Issue 1, March 2010 [http://cadth.ca/en/products/cadth-overviews/vol-1-issue-1/vol-1-issue-1-04#c]</ref><ref>National Institute of Mental Health: Suicide in the U.S.: Statistics and Prevention [http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/suicide-in-the-us-statistics-and-prevention/index.shtml#DB-Therapy]</ref> Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CBT-SP) is a form of DBT adapted for adolescents at high risk for repeated suicide attempts.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stanley B, Brown G, Brent DA, ''et al.'' |title=Cognitive-behavioral therapy for suicide prevention (CBT-SP): treatment model, feasibility, and acceptability |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=48 |issue=10 |pages=1005<U+2013>13 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19730273 |pmc=2888910 |doi=10.1097/CHI.0b013e3181b5dbfe |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0890-8567(09)60165-9}}</ref>

In the U.S., the rate of suicide is increasing for the first time in a decade. The increase in the overall suicide rate between 1999 and 2005 has been due primarily to an increase in suicides among whites aged 40<U+2013>64, with white [[middle-aged]] women experiencing the largest annual increase.<ref>[http://newswise.com/articles/view/545457/ U.S. Suicide Rate Increasing] Newswise, Retrieved on October 21, 2008.</ref>

In the Western world, males die much more often by means of suicide than do females, although females attempt suicide more often. Some medical professionals believe this stems from the fact that males are more likely to end their lives through effective violent means, while women primarily use less severe methods such as overdosing on medications. In most countries, drug overdoses account for about two-thirds of suicides among women and one-third among men.<ref name="Gelder, Mayou 2005 Page 170"/>

===Alcohol and drug use===
In the United States 16.5% of suicides are related to [[alcoholism|alcohol]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Homicides and suicides<U+2014>National Violent Death Reporting System, United States, 2003<U+2013>2004 |journal=MMWR Morb.

==Social aspects==
===Intervention===
{{Main|Suicide intervention}}
The predominant view of [[medicine|modern medicine]] is that suicide is a [[mental health]] concern, associated with factors such as difficulty coping with [[clinical depression|depression]] or other [[mental illness|mental disorder]]s, or pressures such as inescapable [[suffering]] or [[fear]]. A suicide attempt is sometimes interpreted as a cry for help or attention, or an expression of [[Despair (emotion)|despair]] and the wish to escape, rather than a genuine intent to die.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/MNH/ebrief07.pdf |title=WHO Europe <U+2013> Suicide Prevention |date=2005-01-15 |accessdate=2008-09-16 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080624193510/http://www.euro.who.int/document/MNH/ebrief07.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-24}}</ref> Most people who attempt suicide do not complete suicide on a first attempt; those who later gain a history of repetitions have a significantly higher probability of eventual completion of suicide.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shaffer D |title=The epidemiology of teen suicide: an examination of risk factors |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=49 |issue=Suppl |pages=36<U+2013>41 |year=1988 |month=September |pmid=3047106 }}</ref>

In the United States, individuals who express the intent to harm themselves may be<!--law in this area is different in each of the [[U.S. states]]; furthermore--> automatically determined to lack the ''present mental capacity'' to refuse treatment, and can be transported to the [[emergency room|emergency department]] against their will. An [[emergency physician]] will determine whether inpatient care at a [[psychiatric hospital|mental health care facility]] is warranted. This is sometimes referred to as being "[[involuntary commitment|committed]]". A court hearing may be held to determine the individual's ''[[competence (law)|competence]]''. In most states, a [[psychiatrist]] may hold the person for a specific time period without a judicial order. If the psychiatrist determines the person to be a threat to himself or others, the person may be admitted involuntarily to a [[psychotherapy|psychiatric treatment]] facility. This period is usually of three days duration. After this time the person must be discharged or appear in front of a judge. As in any judicial proceeding this person has a right to legal counsel.<ref>{{cite book |author=Giannini, A.

[[Switzerland]] has recently taken steps to legalize [[assisted suicide]] for the chronically mentally ill. The high court in [[Lausanne]], in a 2006 ruling, granted an anonymous individual with longstanding psychiatric difficulties the right to end his own life. At least one leading American [[bioethicist]], Jacob Appel of [[Brown University]], has argued that the American medical community ought to condone suicide in certain individuals with mental illness.<ref name=pmid17649899>{{cite journal |author=Appel, JM |title=A Suicide Right for the Mentally Ill?

[[File:Wakisashi-sepukku-p1000699.jpg|thumb|A ''[[tant<U+014D>]]'' knife prepared for ''[[seppuku]]''.]]
In some jurisdictions, an act or incomplete act of suicide is considered to be a [[crime]]. More commonly, a surviving party member who assisted in the suicide attempt will face criminal charges.

In [[Brazil]], if the help is directed to a minor, the penalty is applied in its double and not considered as [[homicide]]. In [[Italy]] and [[Canada]], instigating another to suicide is also a criminal offense. In [[Singapore]], assisting in the suicide of a [[developmental disability|mentally handicapped]] person is a capital offense. In [[India]], abetting suicide of a minor or a mentally challenged person can result in a maximum 1 year prison term with a possible fine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/IndianPenalCode/S309.htm |title=Laws <U+2013> IPC <U+2013> Section 309 |publisher=Vakilno1.com |date=2006-10-10 |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>

In [[Germany]], the following laws apply to cases of suicide:<ref>"German politician Roger Kusch helped elderly woman to die" [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4251894.ece Times Online] July 2, 2008</ref>
* Active euthanasia (killing on request) is prohibited by article 216 of the StGB ([[Strafgesetzbuch]], German Criminal Code), punishable with six months to five years in jail
* [[Law of Germany|German law]] interprets suicide as an accident and anyone present during suicide may be prosecuted for failure to render aid in an emergency. A suicide legally becomes emergency when a suicidal person loses consciousness. Failure to render aid is punishable under article 323c of the StGB, with a maximum one year jail sentence.

===Religious views===
{{Main|Religious views on suicide}}
In most forms of [[Christianity]], suicide is considered a [[sin]], based mainly on the writings of influential Christian thinkers of the [[Middle Ages]], such as [[St. Augustine]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]; suicide was not considered a sin under the [[Byzantine]] Christian [[code of Justinian]], for instance.<ref>{{cite web |author=Dr. Ronald Roth, D.Acu. |url=http://www.acu-cell.com/suicide.html |title=Suicide & Euthanasia <U+2013> a Biblical Perspective |publisher=Acu-cell.com |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/nholland/suicide.htm |title=Norman N.

[[Judaism]] focuses on the importance of valuing this life, and as such, suicide is tantamount to denying God's goodness in the world. Despite this, under extreme circumstances when there has seemed no choice but to either be killed or forced to betray their religion, Jews have committed individual suicide or [[mass suicide]] (see [[Masada]], [[History of the Jews in France#First persecution of the Jews|First French persecution of the Jews]], and [[York Castle]] for examples) and as a grim reminder there is even a prayer in the Jewish liturgy for "when the knife is at the throat", for those dying "to sanctify God's Name". (See: ''[[Martyrdom]]''). These acts have received mixed responses by Jewish authorities, regarded both as examples of heroic martyrdom, whilst others state that it was wrong for them to take their own lives in anticipation of martyrdom.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.religionfacts.com/euthanasia/judaism.htm |title=Euthanasia and Judaism: Jewish Views of Euthanasia and Suicide |accessdate=2008-09-16 |publisher=ReligionFacts.com}}</ref>

Suicide is not allowed in [[Islam]];<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/euthanasia.shtml "Euthanasia and suicide in Islam"]. [[BBC]]. 7 September 2009. Accessed 11 August 2011.</ref> however, martyring oneself for Allah (during combat) is not considered the same as completing suicide. Suicide in Islam is seen as a sign of disbelief in God.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.submission.org/jihad/suicide.html |title=Suicide Bombing in Islam <U+2013>(Submission)<U+2013> Going to Heaven or to Hell ?Jihad in Islam (Submission)<U+2013> War system in Islam |publisher=Submission |date= |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref>

In [[Hinduism]], suicide is generally frowned upon and is considered equally sinful as murdering another in contemporary Hindu society. [[Hindu texts|Hindu Scriptures]] state that one who commits suicide will become part of the spirit world, wandering earth until the time one would have otherwise died, had one not committed suicide.<ref>Hindu Website. [http://www.hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/h_suicide.asp Hinduism and suicide]</ref> However, Hinduism accept a man's [[right to die|right to end one's life]] through the non-violent practice of fasting to death, termed ''[[Prayopavesa]]''.<ref name="hindu">{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/euthanasia.shtml|title= Hinduism - Euthanasia and Suicide|date= 2009-08-25|publisher= BBC}}</ref> But Prayopavesa is strictly restricted to people who have no desire or ambition left, and no responsibilities remaining in this life.<ref name="hindu" /> [[Jainism]] has a similar practice named ''[[Santhara]]''. [[sati (practice)|Sati]], or self-immolation by widows was prevalent in Hindu society during the Middle Ages.

===Philosophy===
{{Main|Philosophy of suicide}}
[[File:The way out.jpg<U+200E>|thumb|''The Way Out, or [[Suicidal ideation|Suicidal Ideation]]'': [[George Grie]], 2007.]]
Some see suicide as a legitimate matter of personal choice and a human right (colloquially known as the [[right to die]] movement), and maintain that no one should be forced to suffer against their will, particularly from conditions such as incurable disease, mental illness, and old age that have no possibility of improvement. Proponents of this view reject the belief that suicide is always irrational, arguing instead that it can be a valid last resort for those enduring major pain or trauma. This perspective is most popular in [[continental Europe]], where euthanasia and other such topics are commonly discussed in parliament and has a good deal of support.<ref>{{cite news |author=By SIMON ROBINSON |date= Sunday, Mar. 27, 2005 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901050404-1042414,00.html |title=Europe's Way of Death |publisher=TIME |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>

A narrower segment of this group considers suicide something between a grave but condonable choice in some circumstances and a [[sacrosanct]] right for anyone (even a young and healthy person) who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives. Notable supporters of this [[school (discipline)|school of thought]] include German [[pessimist]] philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]],<ref>[http://comp.uark.edu/~mpianal/schopenhauer.htm Schopenhauer | On Suicide<!--Bot generated title-->]{{Dead link|date=May 2009}}</ref> [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and Scottish empiricist [[David Hume]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/suicide/ |title=Suicide (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> Bioethicist [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]] has become the leading advocate for this position in the United States.<ref>Appel, JM. A Suicide Right for the Mentally Ill? A Swiss Case Opens a New Debate, ''The Hastings Center Report''. 2007;37(3):21-23</ref><ref>[[Wesley J. Smith]], Death on Demand: The assisted-suicide movement sheds its fig leaf, ''The Weekly Standard'', June 5, 2007</ref> Adherents of this view often advocate the abrogation of statutes that restrict the liberties of people known to be suicidal, such as laws permitting their involuntary commitment to mental hospitals.

===Advocacy of suicide===
{{See also|Advocacy of suicide}}

Advocacy of suicide has occurred in many [[culture]]s and [[subculture]]s. The [[Japanese military]] during World War II encouraged and glorified [[kamikaze]] attacks, and Japanese society as a whole has been described as suicide 'tolerant' (see [[Suicide in Japan]]).

[[William Francis Melchert-Dinkel]], 47 years old in May 2010, from [[Faribault, Minnesota]],  a licensed nurse from 1991 until February 2009, stands accused of encouraging people to commit suicide while he watched on a [[webcam]].<ref name="nytimes1">{{cite news|last=Davey |first=Monica |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/14/us/14suicide.html |title=Online Talk, Suicides and a Thorny Court Case |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=May 13, 2010 |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}</ref><ref name="theglobeandmail1">{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/article973900.ece |title=Nurse may be linked to multiple suicides, tracker says |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date= |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}</ref><ref name="thestar3">{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/631689 |title=Nurse urged 5 to commit suicide, U.S. police say |publisher=The Toronto Star |date=May 9, 2009 |accessdate=June 26, 2010 | first=Robyn | last=Doolittle}}</ref><ref name="timesonline1">[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article7107061.ece "William Melchert-Dinkel charged with encouraging suicides], ''[[The Sunday Times]]''</ref>

===Language===
Because suicide was a crime in various countries, including in England and Wales until 1961, the word 'commit' has traditionally been used in reference to it. Organisations such as the [[BBC]] and the [[Samaritans]] have stopped using this word because of its negative connotation. 'Attempt' suicide or other phrases are preferred.<ref>Holt, Gerry.
