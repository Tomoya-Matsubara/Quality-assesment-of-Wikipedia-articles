[[Image:1972 Atlantic hurricane season map.png|right|thumb|300px|Track map of the storms during the season]]
The [[1972 Atlantic hurricane season]] is one of four Atlantic hurricane seasons not to have any [[major hurricane|major hurricanes]], the others being the [[1968 Atlantic hurricane season|1968 season]], the [[1986 Atlantic hurricane season|1986 season]], and the [[1994 Atlantic hurricane season|1994 season]]. During the season, seven tropical or subtropical depressions formed, all of which became tropical or subtropical storms or hurricanes.<ref name="Season Summary"/> The season officially began on June 1, 1972 and ended on November 30. These dates typically limit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the eastern [[Atlantic hurricane|Atlantic basin]]. This timeline documents all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, [[landfall (meteorology)|landfalls]], [[Extratropical cyclone#Extratropical transition|extratropical transitions]], as well as dissipation. The timeline also includes information which was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the [[National Hurricane Center]], such as information on a storm that was not operationally warned on, has been included.

The first storm of the season, Subtropical Storm Alpha, formed on May 23, before the season began on June 1. The final storm of the season, Subtropical Storm Delta, dissipated on November 7. There were seven tropical cyclones during the season. Of these, three were subtropical storm, and four were tropical. Of these tropical systems, three became hurricanes; none of these reached Category&nbsp;3 intensity or higher on the [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale]]. Although it was an inactive season, 1972 brought one of the deadliest and most expensive hurricanes to strike the [[United States]], [[Hurricane Agnes]]. Agnes was a weak but large storm that made landfall at the [[Florida]] panhandle and then followed the east coast northward. It killed 122 people and caused $2.1&nbsp;billion (1972&nbsp;dollars) in damage, mostly due to flooding in [[Pennsylvania]] and [[New York]].<ref name="Season Summary">{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/mwreviews/1972.pdf|title=Season Summary for 1972|format=PDF|publisher=US Weather Service|accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref>
