'''Hurricane Diane''' was the costliest [[Atlantic hurricane]] of its time. One of three hurricanes to hit [[North Carolina]] during the [[1955 Atlantic hurricane season]], it [[tropical cyclogenesis|formed]] on August&nbsp;7 from a [[tropical wave]] between the [[Lesser Antilles]] and [[Cape Verde]]. Diane initially moved west-northwestward with little change in its intensity, but began to [[rapid deepening|strengthen rapidly]] after turning to the north-northeast. On August&nbsp;12, the hurricane reached peak [[maximum sustained winds|sustained winds]] of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h), making it a [[tropical cyclone scales|major hurricane]].{{#tag:ref|A major hurricane is a tropical cyclone with [[maximum sustained winds]] of at least 111&nbsp;mph (179&nbsp;km/h), or a Category&nbsp;3 or higher on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir&ndash;Simpson hurricane scale]].<ref name="glo">{{cite web|author=[[National Hurricane Center]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=2010-07-11|title=Glossary of NHC Terms|accessdate=2011-07-23|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110628222802/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml| archivedate= 2011-06-28 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>|group="nb"}} Gradually weakening after veering back west, Diane made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], as a minimal hurricane on August&nbsp;17, just five days after [[Hurricane Connie]] struck near the same area. Diane weakened further after moving inland, at which point the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|United States Weather Bureau]] noted a  decreased threat of further destruction. The storm turned to the northeast, and warm waters from the Atlantic Ocean helped produce record rainfall across the northeastern United States. On August&nbsp;19, Diane emerged into the Atlantic Ocean southeast of New York City, becoming [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] the next day and completely dissipating by August&nbsp;21.

The first area affected by Diane was North Carolina, which suffered coastal flooding but little wind and rain damage. After the storm weakened in Virginia, it maintained an area of moisture that resulted in heavy rainfall after interacting with the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], a process known as [[orographic lift]]. Flooding affecting roads and low-lying areas along the [[Potomac River]]. The northernmost portion of Delaware also saw freshwater flooding, although to a much lesser extent than adjacent states. Diane produced heavy rainfall in eastern Pennsylvania, causing the worst floods on record there, largely in the [[Poconos]] and along the [[Delaware River]]. Rushing waters demolished about 150&nbsp;road and rail bridges and breached or destroyed 30&nbsp;dams. The swollen [[Brodhead Creek]] virtually submerged a summer camp, killing 37&nbsp;people. Throughout Pennsylvania, the disaster killed 101&nbsp;people and caused an estimated $70&nbsp;million in damage (1955&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]).{{#tag:ref|All damage totals are in 1955 [[United States dollar]]s unless otherwise noted.|group="nb"}} Additional flooding spread through the northwest portion of neighboring New Jersey, forcing hundreds of people to evacuate and destroying several bridges, including one built in 1831. Storm damage was evident but less significant in southeastern New York.

Damage from Diane was heaviest in Connecticut, where rainfall peaked at 16.86&nbsp;in (428&nbsp;mm) near [[Torrington, Connecticut|Torrington]]. The storm produced the state's largest flood on record, which effectively split the state into two by destroying bridges and cutting communications. All major streams and valleys were flooded, and 30&nbsp;[[stream gauge]]s reported their highest levels on record. The [[Connecticut River]] at [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] reached a water level of 30.6&nbsp;ft (9.3&nbsp;m), the third highest on record there. The flooding destroyed a large section of downtown [[Winsted, Connecticut|Winsted]], much of which was never rebuilt. Record-high tides and flooded rivers heavily damaged [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island]]. In Massachusetts, flood water levels surpassed those during the [[1938 Long Island hurricane]], breaching multiple dams and inundating adjacent towns and roads. Throughout New England, 206&nbsp;dams were damaged or destroyed, and about 7,000&nbsp;people were injured. Nationwide, Diane killed at least 184&nbsp;people and destroyed 813&nbsp;houses, with another 14,000&nbsp;homes heavily damaged. Monetary losses totaled $754.7&nbsp;million, although the inclusion of loss of business and personal revenue increased the total to over $1&nbsp;billion. In the hurricane's wake, eight states were declared federal disaster areas, and the name Diane was [[List of retired Atlantic hurricane names|retired]].

{{storm path|Diane 1955 track.png}}
Hurricane Diane originated in a [[tropical wave]] first observed as a tropical depression on August&nbsp;7 between the [[Lesser Antilles]] and [[Cape Verde]].<ref name="mwr">{{cite journal|author=Gordon E.

Ships in the region of the storm reported winds of {{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. During the next day, the [[Hurricane Hunters]] reported no increase in strength, and Diane initially remained disorganized.<ref name="mwr"/> The storm interacted with [[Hurricane Connie]] to its northwest in a process known as the [[Fujiwhara effect]], in which Diane turned toward the north. Quick intensification ensued, potentially due to interaction with a [[cold-core low]] that increased [[atmospheric instability]].<ref name="mwr"/> On August&nbsp;12, the storm [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]] into a hurricane, and later that day reached peak winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h),<ref name="bt"/> as recorded by [[reconnaissance aircraft]]. The intensification was so quick that a ship southeast of the center believed Diane was undergoing a loop due to a steady drop in [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]], despite moving away from the hurricane.<ref name="mwr"/>

At its peak, Diane developed a well-defined [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] about {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} in diameter, described by reconnaissance aircraft as taking the shape of an "inverted teacup". The strongest winds were located in the northeast quadrant, where there was a secondary pressure minimum located {{convert|62|mi|km|abbr=on}} northeast of the eye.<ref name="mwr"/> After moving to the north for about a day, Diane resumed its westward motion on August&nbsp;13, after Hurricane Connie to the northwest had weakened. That day, Diane reached its lowest pressure of {{convert|969|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}.<ref name="mwr"/> It maintained its peak winds for about 54&nbsp;hours,<ref name="bt"/> after which it weakened due to cooler air in the region. By August&nbsp;15, the eye had become poorly defined, and winds steadily weakened. As it approached land, its center deteriorated, with minimal precipitation near the center; the eye was observed on a radar installed in July 1955.

Late on August&nbsp;14, more than two days before Diane made landfall, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|United States Weather Bureau]] issued a hurricane alert from Georgia through North Carolina. On August&nbsp;15, the agency issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane warning]] from [[Brunswick, Georgia]] to Wilmington, North Carolina, although the warning was later extended to the south and north to [[Fernandina, Florida]] and [[Cape Hatteras, North Carolina]], respectively. The agency also issued storm warnings southward to [[Saint Augustine, Florida]] and northward to [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], including the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] and [[Delaware Bay|Delaware]] bays.
