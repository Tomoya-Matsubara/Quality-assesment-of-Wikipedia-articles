The resolution, which was approved by both the Lebanese and Israeli governments the following days, called for disarmament of Hezbollah, for withdrawal of Israel from Lebanon, and for the deployment of [[Lebanese Armed Forces|Lebanese soldiers]] and an enlarged [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]] (UNIFIL) in the south. [[UNIFIL]] was given an expanded mandate, including the ability to use force to ensure that their area of operations was not used for hostile activities, and to resist attempts by force to prevent them from discharging their duties.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=20106&Cr=Leban&Cr1=|publisher=UN News Centre|date=3 October 2006|title=Lebanon: UN peacekeepers lay out rules of engagement, including use of force|accessdate=25 November 2011 }}</ref> The Lebanese army began deploying in southern Lebanon on 17 August 2006.

==Background==
{{Main|Israeli<U+2013>Lebanese conflict}}
Cross-border attacks from [[southern Lebanon]] into Israel by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) date as far back as 1968, and followed the [[Six-Day War]]; the area became a significant base for attacks following the arrival of the PLO leadership and its [[Fatah]] brigade following their 1971 [[Black September in Jordan|expulsion from Jordan]]. Starting about this time, increasing [[Demographics of Lebanon|demographic tensions]] related to the Lebanese [[National Pact]], which had divided governmental powers among religious groups throughout the country 30 years previously, began running high and led in part to the [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975<U+2013>1990).

Concurrently, Syria began a [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon|29-year military occupation]] in 1976. Israel's [[Operation Litani|1978 invasion of Lebanon]] failed to stem the Palestinian attacks in the long run, but [[1982 Lebanon War|Israel invaded Lebanon]] again in 1982 and forcibly expelled the PLO.<ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/type,CHRON,,LBN,469f38b21e,0.html Chronology for Druze in Lebanon] UNHCR Retrieved 26 May 2011</ref> Israel withdrew to a [[Israeli Security Zone|borderland buffer zone]] in southern Lebanon, held with the aid of proxy militants in the [[South Lebanon Army]] (SLA).<ref name="Encarta: Arab-Israeli Conflict">{{Cite encyclopedia

The invasion also led to the conception of a new [[Shi'a]] [[Paramilitary|militant group]], which in 1985, established itself politically under the name [[Hezbollah]], and declared an armed struggle to end the [[1982-2000 South Lebanon conflict|Israeli occupation]] of Lebanese territory.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4314423.stm Who are Hezbollah?] [[BBC News]]</ref><ref name="Encarta: Hassan Nasrallah">{{Cite encyclopedia

The withdrawal also led to the immediate collapse of the SLA, and Hezbollah took control of the area in rapid succession. Later citing continued Israeli control of the disputed [[Shebaa farms]] region and the [[internment]] of [[Lebanese prisoners in Israel]], Hezbollah intensified its cross-border attacks, and used the tactic of seizing soldiers from Israel as leverage for a [[Israeli MIA prisoner exchanges|prisoner exchange]] in 2004.<ref name="Institute for Palestinian Studies">{{cite web

In August 2006, in an article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[Seymour Hersh]] claimed that the [[White House]] gave the green light for the [[Israeli government]] to execute an attack on [[Hezbollah]] in Lebanon.

According to [[Jonathan Cook]], the Winograd Committee leaked a testimony from Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] suggesting that Olmert "had been preparing for such a war at least four months before the official casus belli: the capture by Hizbullah of two Israeli soldiers from a border post on 12 July 2006." Cook also reported that "Olmert told Winograd that, far from making war on the hoof in response to the capture of the two soldiers (the main mitigating factor for Israel<U+2019>s show of aggression), he had been planning the attack on Lebanon since at least March 2006."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2007/03/13/the-real-goal-of-israel-s-war-on-lebanon |title=The Real Goal of Israel's War on Lebanon |accessdate=13 March 2007 |last=Cook |first=Jonathan |publisher=[[CounterPunch]]}}</ref>

==Abduction efforts in the year prior to conflict==
In June 2005, an [[Israel Defense Forces]] paratroop unit operating near the [[Shebaa Farms]] engaged three Lebanese it identified as Hezbollah special force members, killing one. Videotapes recovered by the paratroopers contained footage of the three recording detailed accounts of the area.<ref name="Harel">Amos Harel, "Chronicle of Disaster," 18 July 2008, www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1003170.html</ref>

Over the following 12 months, Hezbollah made three unsuccessful attempts to abduct Israeli soldiers. On 21 November 2005, a number of Hezbollah special forces attempted to attack an Israeli outpost in [[Ghajar]], a village straddling the border between Lebanon and the [[Golan Heights]]. The outpost had been deserted following an intelligence warning, and three of the Hezbollah militants were killed when Israeli sniper David Markovich shot a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] they were carrying, causing it to explode. From his sniper position, Markovich shot and killed a fourth gunman shortly thereafter.<ref name="Harel" /><ref>Dudkevitch, Paratrooper Sniper Becomes Hero, Jerusalem Post Online Edition, 22 November 2005.</ref>

At the same time, a Hezbollah ground contingent infiltrated the [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|border]] into Israel through a "dead zone" in the border fence, hiding in an overgrown [[wadi]]. They attacked a patrol of two Israeli [[Humvee]]s patrolling the border near Zar'it, using pre-positioned explosives and anti-tank missiles, killing three soldiers, injuring two, and capturing two soldiers (First Sergeant [[Ehud Goldwasser]] and Sergeant First Class [[Eldad Regev]]).<ref name=unreport/><ref>{{Cite news|title=Israel/Lebanon Under fire: Hizbullah<U+2019>s attacks on northern Israel|date=14 September 2006|accessdate=27 September 2006|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE020252006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919183058/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE020252006|archivedate=19 September 2006}}</ref>

In response to the Hezbollah feint attacks, the IDF conducted a routine check of its positions and patrols, and found that contact with two jeeps was lost. A rescue force was immediately dispatched to the area, and confirmed that two soldiers were missing after 20 minutes. A [[Merkava|Merkava Mk III]] tank, an [[Armored personnel carrier]], and a [[helicopter]] were immediately dispatched into Lebanon. The tank hit a large land mine, killing its crew of four. Another soldier was killed and two lightly injured by mortar fire as they attempted to recover the bodies.<ref name=unreport /><ref name="Exit Strategy"/>

Hezbollah named the attack "[[2006 Hezbollah cross-border raid|Operation Truthful Promise]]" after leader [[Hassan Nasrallah]]'s public pledges over the prior year and a half to seize Israeli soldiers and swap them for [[Lebanese prisoners in Israel|four Lebanese held by Israel]]:

Nasrallah claimed that Israel had broken a previous deal to release these prisoners, and since diplomacy had failed, violence was the only remaining option.<!--Quote: "Second, the reason for today's operation was one-upmanship within the enemy government during the previous prisoner exchange.

During the first day of the war the Israeli Air Force, artillery and navy conducted more than 100 attacks mainly against Hizbullah bases in south Lebanon, among them the regional headquarters in Ya'tar. Five bridges across the Litani and Zahrani rivers were also destroyed, reportedly to prevent Hizbullah from transferring the abducted soldiers to the north.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Hizbullah/Pages/Hizbullah%20attack%20on%20northern%20border%20and%20IDF%20response%2012-Jul-2006.aspx | title =  IDF Spokesman: Hizbullah attack on northern border and IDF response | publisher = Ministry of Foreign Affairs| author= IDF Spokesman | date= 12 July 2006| accessdate= 3 July 2013}}</ref>

It was later reported that the Israel Air Force after midnight, 13 July, attacked and destroyed 59 stationary medium range [[Fajr]] rocket launchers positioned throughout southern Lebanon. '''Operation Specific Weight''' allegedly only took 34 minutes to carry out but was the result of six years of intelligence gathering and planning. Between half and two-thirds of Hizbullah medium range rocket capability was estimated by the IDF to have been wiped out. According to Harel and Issacharoff the operation was a "Israel's most impressive military action" and a "devastating blow for Hezbollah". In the coming days IAF allegedly also attacked and destroyed a large proportion of Hizbullah's long range [[Zilzal]] missiles.<ref>Harel and Issacharof, p. 91-92</ref>

"All the long-range rockets have been destroyed," Chief of Staff Halutz allegedly told the Israeli government, "we've won the war."<ref name=Times>{{cite news | url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article620874.ece | title = Humbling of the supertroops shatters Israeli army morale | publisher = The Sunday Times | author= Uzi Mahnaimi | date= 27 August 2006 | accessdate= 4 December 2011 | location=London}} Original link inaccessible, alternative link {{cite news | url= http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/pdf/Archive/Rec/rec.martial-arts/2006-08/msg04921.pdf | title = here }}</ref>

According to military analyst [[William Arkin]] there is "little evidence" that the Israeli Air Force even attempted, much less succeeded in, wiping out the medium and long range rocket capability in the first days of the war. He dismissed the whole claim as an "absurdity" and a "tale".<ref>Arkin p.128-129</ref> Benjamin Lambeth, however, insisted that it was far-fetched to suggest that the "authoritative Israeli leadership pronouncements" were not based on facts.

Hizbullah long remained silent on this episode of the war. On the sixth anniversary of the Lebanon war Hizbullah chairman Hassan Nasrallah claimed that Hizbullah had known that the Israelis were collecting information on the rocket platforms and launchers and managed to move them without being detected.

During the war the [[Israeli Air Force]] flew 11,897 combat missions, which was more than the number of sorties during the [[1973 October War]] (11,223) and almost double the number during the 1982 [[1982 Lebanon War|First Lebanon War]] (6,052).<ref>Kober (2008), p. 23</ref>

The combined effect of the massive air and artillery bombardment on Hizbullah capacity to fire short-range Katyusha rockets on northern Israel was very meager. According to the findings of the post-war military investigations the IDF shelling succeeded only in destroying about 100 out of 12,000 Katyusha launchers <U+2013> less than one percent of the total. The massive fire led to a severe shortage of ammunition towards the end of the war.<ref>Rapaport (2010), p.19</ref> According to [[Human Rights Watch]], 51 combatants were killed in Israeli bombardments.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.hrw.org/en/node/10734/section/11 | title =Why They Died  | publisher = Human Rights Watch | date= 2 September 2007| accessdate= 13 August 2013}}</ref>

==Hezbollah rocket attacks on Israel==

On 16 July, eight employees of the Israel Railways were killed by direct rocket hits on the Haifa train depot.<ref name="mfa_casualties" /> Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah defended the attacks, saying that Hezbollah initially had aimed its rockets on "military sites only". But since Israel systematically had bombed civilian targets he felt that Hizbullah had no choice but to answer in kind and target Israeli cities.<ref>HRW (August 2007), pp. 99<U+2013>100</ref>

The attack on the Haifa depot was not the first civilian target to be hit by Hizbullah. Civilians in the border communities were hurt in the initial cover fire on IDF positions for the cross-border raid. Two Israeli civilians were killed in an attack near the air force base at [[Mount Meron]] on July, 14. Since Hizbullah rockets were not very accurate it is unclear whether civilians were intentionally targeted in these attacks. After the attack on Haifa, however, Hizbullah made no attempt to cover this fact. According to a Human Rights Watch study civilian Israeli targets were mentioned four times as often in official Hizbullah war time communiques as was military targets.<ref>HRW (August 2007), p. 11</ref>

Israel published an alleged range card for upgraded Grad rocket launcher placed outside the village of Shihin in the Western sector of South Lebanon, issued by the Artillery Department of the elite Nasr Unit of Hizbullah. This list included 91 targets, 56 of whom were civilian and 27 were IDF posts or bases. The military targets had three-digit reference numbers while civilian targets had double-digit numbers.<ref>Ehrlich p. 166</ref>

After the high number of Lebanese civilian casualties in the [[Qana airstrike]], Israel announced a unilateral freeze in its air attacks on Lebanon. Hizbullah then halted its own rocket attacks on Israel. When Israel resumed its air attacks on Lebanon, Hizbullah followed suit and recommenced rocket attacks on Israeli targets.

Hizbullah rocket attacks also targeted and succeeded in hitting military targets in Israel. The Israeli military censorship was, however, very strict and explicitly forbade Israel-based media from reporting such incidents. The war time instruction to media stated that "The Military Censor will not approve reports on missile hits at IDF bases and/or strategic facilities."<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=30102 | title = Censorship Policy Regarding Fighting in the North | publisher = | author= Col.

==The ground war==

[[File:D9N 02.jpg|thumb|[[IDF Caterpillar D9]]N [[armored bulldozer]]s destroy a Hezbollah bunker.]]
Hezbollah engaged in [[guerrilla]] warfare with IDF ground forces, fighting from well-fortified positions, often in urban areas, and attacking with small, well-armed units. Hezbollah fighters were highly trained, and were equipped with flak jackets, [[night vision device|night-vision goggles]], communications equipment, and sometimes with Israeli uniforms and equipment. An Israeli soldier who participated in the war said that Hezbollah fighters were "nothing like Hamas or the Palestinians. They are trained and highly qualified. All of us were kind of surprised".<ref name="disciplined"/>

During engagements with the IDF, Hezbollah concentrated on inflicting losses on the IDF, believing an unwillingness to absorb steady losses to be Israel's strategic weakness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%DD=860|title=The Jamestown Foundation: single|publisher=Jamestown.org|accessdate=29 May 2011}}</ref> However, Hezbollah sustained greater losses than the IDF during ground engagements.

Hezbollah countered IDF armor through the use of sophisticated Russian-made [[anti-tank guided missile]]s (ATGMs). According to Merkava tank program administration, 52 [[Merkava]] [[main battle tank]]s were damaged (45 of them by different kinds of ATGM), missiles penetrated 22 tanks, but only 5 tanks were destroyed, one of them by an [[improvised explosive device]] (IED). The Merkava tanks that were penetrated were predominantly Mark II and Mark III models, but five Mark IV tanks were also penetrated. All but two of these tanks were rebuilt and returned to service.<ref name="jdw230806" />

The IDF declared itself satisfied with the Merkava Mark IV's performance during the war. Hezbollah caused additional casualties using ATGMs to collapse buildings onto Israeli troops sheltering inside.<ref name="jdw230806" /> As a result, IDF units did not linger in any one area for an extended period of time.<ref name="disciplined"/> Hezbollah fighters often used tunnels to emerge quickly, fire an anti-tank missile, and then disappear again.<ref name="disciplined">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/07/world/middleeast/07hezbollah.html|work=The New York Times|first1=Steven|last1=Erlanger|first2=RICHARD A.|last2=OPPEL Jr|title=A Disciplined Hezbollah Surprises Israel With Its Training, Tactics and Weapons|date=7 August 2006|accessdate=25 November 2011 }}</ref>

On 14 July 2006, [[INS Hanit]] a Sa'ar 5-class corvette of the Israeli Navy, suffered damage after being struck by a Hezbollah C-802 (or C-701) anti-ship missile.  Four crew members were killed during the attack but INS Hanit stayed afloat, extricated itself and made the rest of the journey back to [[Ashdod]] port for repairs on its own power.

Roth also noted that "Hezbollah fighters often didn't carry their weapons in the open or regularly wear military uniforms, which made them a hard target to identify.

According to the [[Yedioth Ahronoth]] "Encyclopedia" of the Second Lebanon War, the main reason for the discrepancy between Lebanese and Israeli estimates of the number of Hezbollah fatalities during the war (700 and 300 respectively) was that the former included only Hizbullah '''combatants''' while the latter also included '''civilian''' members of Hezbollah.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.ynet.co.il/yaan/0,7340,L-799018-Nzk5MDE4XzE3NTE2NzU0Nl8xNDg2ODcyMDAeq-FreeYaan,00.html | title = <U+05DE><U+05DC><U+05D7><U+05DE><U+05EA> <U+05DC><U+05D1><U+05E0><U+05D5><U+05DF> <U+05D4><U+05E9><U+05E0><U+05D9><U+05D9><U+05D4> (The second Lebanon war)| publisher = Yedioth Achronoth/Encyclopedia| accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref>

Hizbullah General-Secretary Hassan Nasrallah said in an interview with New TV August shortly after the war that between 10 and 12 Hizbullah commanders were killed in the war. None of the first or second levels of the leadership were harmed. Three commanders of the third level however were killed; an operations officer in the Bint Jbeil axis, a logistics officer and a third commander involved in the military side of the party. In addition three or four town commanders and four or five village commanders were killed in the war.<ref>Noe, Nicholas, ''Voice of Hezbollah, the statements of Sayed Hassan Nasrallah'', Verso, London and New York, 2007, p. 398-99</ref>

==Psychological warfare==
During the war, the IAF dropped 17,000 leaflets over Lebanon in 47 missions, and sent more than 700,000 computerized voice messages. Many of them contained caricatures of Hassan Nasrallah and Hezbollah leading Lebanon to ruin and making civilians suffer, showing them as puppets of Iran and Syria, and calling on civilians to help remove Hezbollah. Another leaflet addressing Hezbollah fighters told them that they were lied to by their leaders, that they were "sent like sheep to be butchered, lacking military training and without proper combat gear", that they could not hope to face "highly trained soldiers that fight to protect their homeland, their people, and their home", referring to them as "mercenaries" without the support of the Lebanese public, and urging them to run and save their lives. On 26 July, Israel dropped leaflets containing illustrations of nine tombstones with the name of a dead Hezbollah fighter on each one, in response to Nasrallah "deceiving" people on the amount of Hezbollah casualties. Another leaflet urged Hezbollah fighters to stop bleeding and fighting for Nasrallah, who sat safe in a bunker, to stop fighting against Lebanese national interests, and to return to their homes and families. On 11 August, Israel dropped leaflets accusing Hezbollah of hiding its "great losses", and containing the names of 90<U+2013>100 Hezbollah fighters killed. Israeli technicians also hacked into [[Al-Manar]] and broadcast clips, criticizing Nasrallah, showing the bodies of Hezbollah fighters, footage from Israeli raids and airstrikes, and captured Hezbollah equipment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psywar.org/israellebanon.php|title=Psychological Operations during the Israel-Lebanon War 2006|publisher=Psywar.org|accessdate=16 January 2011}}</ref>

==Ceasefire==

Terms for a ceasefire had been drawn and revised several times over the course of the conflict, yet successful agreement between the two sides took several weeks.

On 11 August 2006 the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved [[UN Security Council Resolution 1701]], in an effort to end the hostilities. It was accepted by the Lebanese government and Hezbollah on 12 August 2006, and by the Israeli government on 13 August 2006.

===Lebanon===
[[File:Hezbollah territory.JPG|thumb|A sign erected after the 2006 Israeli-Lebanon war in [[South Lebanon]] which displays rockets and Hezbollah leader [[Hassan Nasrallah]]]]

At the outbreak of hostilities, Prime Minister [[Fuad Saniora]] promised to rein in Hezbollah in an effort to stop Israel's offensive. Saniora said that there could be no sovereign state of Lebanon without the group's disarming. The former President of Lebanon [[Amin Gemayel]], a longtime critic of Hezbollah said, "Hezbollah took a unilateral action, but its repercussions will affect the entire country."<ref name="foxnews.com">[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,203825,00.html Fighting with Israel deepens Lebanese divisions over Hezbollah], Associated Press, 15, July 2006</ref>
The war deepened the longtime divide in Lebanon over Hezbollah's role. Many admired the organization for being the sole group to fight against Israel. Others considered it to be a dangerous militia that executes Iran and Syria policies in Lebanon. The divide over Hezbollah followed mostly sectarian lines, with [[Shias]] largely supporting the group and [[Sunnis]], Christians and [[Druze|Druse]] mostly opposing it.<ref name="foxnews.com"/>

On 27 August 2006, Nasrallah said in an interview with [[Al Jadeed|New TV]] that the abduction of the two soldiers did not cause the war. It only advanced a long planned war for a few months. But he added: "If there was even a 1 percent chance that the July 11 capturing operation would have led to a war like the one that happened, would you have done it? I would say no, absolutely not, for humanitarian, moral, social, security, military, and political reasons. [<U+2026>] What happened is not an issue of a reaction to a capturing operation<U+2026> what happened was already planned for. The fact that it happened in July has averted a situation that would have been a lot worse, had the war been launched in October."<ref>Nicholas Noe, ''Voice of Hezbollah, The Statements of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah'', Verso, 2007, pp. 394<U+2013>5</ref>

On 22 September 2006, some eight hundred thousand Hezbollah supporters gathered in Beirut for a rally at which Nasrallah stated that Hezbollah had achieved a "divine and strategic victory."<ref name=CNN_800>{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/09/22/lebanon.rally|title=Hezbollah leader: Militants 'won't surrender arms'|publisher=CNN|date=22 September 2006|accessdate=30 April 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/766373.html|title=Lebanese Christian leader: War was disaster, Hezbollah must disarm|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|date=24 September 2006|accessdate=13 July 2008}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=worldNews&storyID=2006-09-21T223752Z_01_L2115474_RTRUKOC_0_US-MIDEAST-LEBANON.xml&archived=False|title=Hizbollah backers gather for Lebanon "victory" rally|date=21 September 2006|first=Laila|last=Bassam|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=25 November 2011 }}{{dead link|date=July 2008}}</ref>

On 21 August, a group of demobilized Israel reserve soldiers and parents of soldiers killed in the fighting started [[2006 Israeli reserve soldiers' protest|a movement]] calling for the resignation of Olmert and the establishment of a state commission of [[Public inquiry|inquiry]]. They set up a [[protest tent]] opposite the Knesset and grew to over 2,000 supporters by 25 August,<ref name="Yoman">[http://switch3.castup.net/cunet/gm.asp?ai=31&ar=yoman "Yoman"], ''Israel Broadcasting Authority'', 25 August 2006 {{he icon}}</ref> including the influential [[Movement for Quality Government in Israel|Movement for Quality Government]].<ref name="Yoman"/><ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3295083,00.html "Hundreds support protesting reservists"], ''[[Ynetnews]]'', 24 August 2006</ref> On 28 August, Olmert [[2006 Israeli reserve soldiers' protest#Prospects for a state commission|announced]] that there would be no independent state or governmental commission of inquiry, but two internal inspection probes, one to investigate the political echelon and one to examine the IDF, and likely a third commission to examine the [[Home Front]], to be announced at a later date. These would have a more limited mandate and less authority than a single inquiry commission headed by a retired judge.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/755787.html "Olmert: An inquiry commission will not be formed, we do not have the luxury to submerge in investigating the past"], ''[[Haaretz]]'', 28 August 2006 {{he icon}}</ref> The political and military committees were to be headed by former director of [[Mossad]] [[Nahum Admoni]] and former Chief of Staff [[Amnon Lipkin-Shahak]], respectively. Critics argued that these committees amount to a [[whitewash]], due to their limited authority, limited investigatory scope, their self-appointed basis, and that neither would be headed by a retired judge.<ref>[http://switch3.castup.net/cunet/gm.asp?ai=31&ar=mabat "Mabat"], ''[[Israel Broadcasting Authority]]'', 28 August 2006 {{he icon}}</ref>

Due to these pressures, on 11 October, Admoni was replaced by retired justice [[Eliyahu Winograd]] as chair of the political probe, and the probe itself was elevated to the status of governmental commission with near-state commission mandate: the [[Winograd Commission]]. On 12 September, former defense minister [[Moshe Arens]] spoke of ''"the defeat of Israel"'' in calling for a state committee of inquiry. He said that Israel had lost ''"to a very small group of people, 5000 Hezbollah fighters, which should have been no match at all for the IDF"'', and stated that the conflict could have ''"some very fateful consequences for the future."''<ref>[http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/commentary/newsblogs/jerusalemdateline/060908.aspx CBN.com]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> Disclosing his intent to shortly resign, [[Ilan Harari]], the IDF's chief education officer, stated at a conference of senior IDF officers that Israel lost the war, becoming the first senior active duty officer to publicly state such an opinion.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Halutz disputes officer's remarks that Israel lost war|date=22 September 2006|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/766154.html|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=25 November 2011 }}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> IDF Major General [[Yiftah Ron-Tal|Yiftah Ron Tal]], on 4 October 2006 became the second and highest ranking serving officer to express his opinion that the IDF failed ''"to win the day in the battle against Hezbollah"'' as well as calling for Lt.

However, Eyal Zisser, director of the [[Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies]] at Tel Aviv University, took a contrary position and expressed the view that the war was in fact a strategic success for Israel and a Hezbollah defeat. He noted that Hezbollah had "lost about a third of its elite fighting force" and that "despite mistakes made by the IDF in conducting the military campaign, Israeli soldiers triumphed in every face-to-face battle with Hezbollah." He concluded that "as time passes, the severity of the blow suffered by Lebanon and its people from the 2006 war becomes clear."<ref>Zisser, [http://www.meforum.org/2054/nasrallahs-defeat-in-the-2006-war Nasrallah<U+2019>s Defeat in the 2006 War: Assessing Hezbollah<U+2019>s Influence], 23 January 2009</ref>

In 2008, [[Ehud Barak]], the replacement defense minister for Peretz, stated that the conflict failed to disarm Hezbollah, and that the group is increasingly entrenched in South Lebanon, further stating that "Hezbollah is stronger than ever and has more rockets than at the outbreak of the Lebanon war in the summer of 2006"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gZEvvDWHJCrybf38T2Ylf0aplRXw|title=Israel's Barak says Hezbollah stronger than ever: report|agency=AFP|date=7 January 2008|accessdate=21 November 2009 }}</ref> but he later noted that "[Israeli] deterrence still exists."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3810160,00.html|title=Barak warns Lebanese government|publisher=Ynetnews.com|accessdate=16 January 2011}}</ref> The IDF's Northern Command cited this deterrence as one reason Hezbollah did not fire any rockets into Israel during [[Operation Cast Lead]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Yaakov|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1253198148634&pagename=JPArticle%2FShowFull|title=Analysis: Teheran is restraining an already wary Hizbullah|publisher=Fr.jpost.com|accessdate=29 May 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429195009/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1253198148634&pagename=JPArticle%2FShowFull|archivedate=29 April 2011 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

Israeli military historian [[Martin van Creveld]] stated that Israel's war against Hezbollah was indeed "marked by a long series of failures" but he criticized the [[Winograd Commission]] for its failure to take into account the substantial achievements of the war. He noted that hundreds of Hezbollah fighters were killed in the war, and that the organization had "the fight knocked out of it", since following the war, Israel experienced a level of calm on its Lebanon border not seen since the mid-1960s. He also noted that Hezbollah was "thrown out of South Lebanon", and was replaced by "a fairly robust United Nations peacekeeping force" to prevent its return.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://forward.com/articles/12579/israel-s-war-with-hezbollah-was-not-a-failure-/|title=Israel's War With Hezbollah Was Not a Failure|publisher=Forward|author= Martin van Creveld|date=30 January 2008|accessdate=1 June 2012}}</ref>

IDF Maj.-Gen. (res.)

According to the Winograd Commission Report, the Second Lebanon War was regarded as a "missed opportunity" and that "Israel initiated a long war, which ended without a defined military victory". The report continued to state that "a semi-military organization of a few thousand men resisted, for a few weeks, the strongest army in the Middle East, which enjoyed full [[air superiority]] and size and technology advantages". Furthermore, [[Hezbollah]]'s rocket attacks continued throughout the war and the IDF did not provide an effective response to it. Following a long period of using standoff firepower and limited ground activities, the IDF launched a large-scale ground offensive close to the UN Security Council's resolution which imposed a cease-fire. "This offensive did not result in military gains and was not completed".

Later in the Report, the Commission stated that "[a] decision [was] made in the night of 12 July to react (to the capturing) with immediate and substantive military action and to set... ambitious goals." This decision had immediate repercussions in that subsequent decisions were limited mainly to a choice between a) "a short, painful and unexpected blow on Hezbollah" and b) "to bring about a significant change of the reality in the South of Lebanon with a large ground operation,[occupying]...the South of Lebanon and 'cleaning' it of Hezbollah". "The fact Israel went to war before it decided which option to select and without an exit strategy, all these constituted serious failures of the decision making process."

As for achievements, the Commission reported that "SC resolution 1701, and the fact that it was adopted unanimously, were an achievement for Israel."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/world/middleeast/31winograd-web.html|title=English Summary of the Winograd Commission Report|date=30 January 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=25 November 2011 }}</ref>

In the aftermath of the conflict US President [[George W.

In a speech given on 15 August 2006, Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]] claimed that the Arab resistance against Israel would continue to grow stronger, saying, "Your weapons, warplanes, rockets and even [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|your atomic bomb]] will not protect you in the future."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sana.sy/eng/21/2006/08/15/57835.htm|title=Speech of President Bashar al-Assad at Journalists Union 4th Conference|publisher=Syrian Arab News Agency|date=15 August 2006|accessdate=5 May 2008}}</ref>

''[[The Economist]]'' magazine concluded that by surviving this asymmetrical military conflict with Israel, Hezbollah effectively emerged with a military and political victory from this conflict. They cite the facts that Hezbollah was able to sustain defenses on Lebanese soil and inflict unmitigated rocket attacks on Israeli civilians in the face of a punishing air and land campaign by the IDF.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Hizbullah's shallow victory|work=The Economist|date=19 August 2006|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=E1_SSJGSJD|accessdate=25 November 2011 }}</ref>

Matt M. Matthews, a military historian at the Combat Studies Institute of the U.S. Army [[Command and General Staff College]] praised Hezbollah [[Paramilitary|paramilitaries]] and reflected on what he described as "the lackluster performance of the IDF." He attributed this to several factors including (Lieutenant-General and Chief of the IDF General Staff) Halutz's steadfast confidence in air power coupled with continuing [[counterinsurgency|COIN]] operations against the Palestinians at the expense of training for major combat operations.<ref name=csi>{{cite journal|title=We Were Caught Unprepared: The 2006 Hezbollah-Israeli War|year=2007|url=http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/download/csipubs/matthewsOP26.pdf|author=Matthews, Matt|isbn=978-0-16-079899-3|publisher=Combat Institute Studies Press|location=Fort Leavenworth, Kansas|format=PDF|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5j0uD2zlT|archivedate=14 August 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=10 August 2009}}.

The US [[Congressional Research Service]] found that although Hezbollah's military capabilities may have been substantially reduced, its long-term potential as a guerrilla movement appeared to remain intact: "Observers note that Hezbollah<U+2019>s leaders have been able to claim a level of 'victory' simply by virtue of not having decisively 'lost'."<ref>Congressional Research Service, 2006 [http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33566.pdf Lebanon: The Israel-Hamas-Hezbollah Conflict]</ref>

In the 2007 [[BBC]] documentary, ''Hunting for Hezbollah'', BBC [[This World (television programme)|This World]] reporter Emeka Onono referred to Israel's inability to eliminate Hezbollah as a "humiliation for Israel's supposedly all-powerful army," and he went on to claim that Hezbollah's survival propelled it to hero status throughout many Muslim nations.<ref>"Hunting for Hezbollah." Norman, Louise. This World. British Broadcasting Corp. 4 July 2007. Television.</ref>

British military historian [[John Keegan]] stated that the outcome of the war was "misreported as an Israeli defeat" due to anti-Israel bias in the international media. He concluded that Hezbollah had suffered heavy losses, and that a cease-fire came into effect before Israel could completely dislodge Hezbollah from its positions. He also stated that the casualties sustained by Israel during the war had alarmed the Israeli Government and High Command because Israel's small population is acutely vulnerable to losses in battle.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/>

[[Charles Krauthammer]], a syndicated columnist and political commentator, citing an interview by which Nasrallah admitted that he would not have captured the soldiers had he known that it would lead to war, wrote, "Nasrallah's admission, vastly underplayed in the West, makes clear what Lebanese already knew. Hezbollah may have won the propaganda war, but on the ground it lost. Badly." He noted that Hezbollah's entrenched infrastructure along Israel's border was shattered and would not be easily rebuilt due to the presence of the Lebanese Army and a robust UNIFIL force, hundreds of Hezbollah's best fighters were killed in the war, and that many Lebanese were angry with Hezbollah for provoking a war which largely devastated the country.<ref>Krauthammer, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/31/AR2006083101444.html Hezbollah's 'Victory'], 9 January 2006</ref>

The ''[[Washington Post]]'' stated that the war had been "widely seen as a disaster for the Israeli military". It further reported that the US Defense Department had sent as many as a dozen teams to interview Israeli officers who had fought in the war, to learn the lessons of the Israeli army's failures during the conflict.<ref>{{Cite news|title=2006 Israel-Lebanon War Looms Large in Pentagon Debate on Future|date=6 April 2009|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/05/AR2009040502235.html|accessdate=6 March 2012 |work=The Washington Post|first=Greg|last=Jaffe}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Pentagon learning from 'IDF's disaster'|work=Ynet News|date=4 June 2009|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3697924,00.html|accessdate=6 March 2012 }}</ref>

Michael Young, opinion page editor at the Lebanese ''[[Daily Star (Lebanon)|Daily Star]]'' newspaper, stated that Hezbollah turned "the stench of defeat into the smell of victory," through clever use of its propaganda machine. He suggested that Hezbollah had "hoodwinked" pundits who believed that Hezbollah was victorious, and opined that "one dreads to imagine what Hezbollah would recognize as a military loss."<ref>Young, [http://reason.com/archives/2006/08/24/hoodwinked-by-hezbollah Hoodwinked by Hezbollah]</ref>

American military strategist and historian [[Edward Luttwak]] drew comparisons with the 1973 Yom Kippur War, where what initially looked like an Israeli setback later turned out to be an IDF victory and an Arab defeat. He stated that although some IDF tanks were penetrated by missiles, they also largely limited IDF casualties, and that Hezbollah had failed to inflict massive losses on the IDF and to kill large numbers of Israelis in rocket attacks.<ref>Lutttwak, [http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/5573,news-comment,news-politics,again-israeli-gloom-is-misplaced Again, Israeli gloom is misplaced]</ref>

[[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] professor and Peterhouse Fellow [[Brendan Simms]] summed up the war this way; "Hezbollah have suffered a setback (but are too clever to admit it) and the Israelis have scored a long-term success (but are too narrow-minded to realize it)."<ref>Simms, Hezbollah have suffered a setback, [[Social Affairs Unit]], 24 August 2006</ref>

Journalist [[Michael Totten]] wrote that "Hezbollah lost and Hezbollah knows it." He questioned why Hezbollah did not attack Israel when the IDF attacked Hamas in [[Gaza City|Gaza]] in 2008, and noted that most of Nasrallah's supporters "want Hezbollah to deter Israeli invasions, not to invite Israeli invasions". Totten concluded that Nasrallah's boasts "play well in much of the Arab world", but that the 2006 "victory" seemed "empty at home."<ref>Totten, Michael, [http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2009/01/30/who-really-won-the-second-lebanon-war/ Who Really Won the Second Lebanon War], 30 January 2009</ref>

The 2007 report "'War to the Last Moment': The Israeli Media in the Second Lebanon War" by the Israeli media monitoring NGO [http://www.keshev.org.il Keshev] (trans. "Awareness")<ref name = Keshev1>{{cite news | url=  http://people.socsci.tau.ac.il/mu/danield/files/2010/07/KESHEV-ENGLISH-REPORT-LEBANON-WAR1.pdf | title = "War to the Last Moment" <U+2013> The Israeli Media in the Second Lebanon War.  | publisher = Keshev | author= | date= July 2007| accessdate= 20 November 2012}}</ref> stated that the Israeli media "except for a few exceptional instances...covered the war in an almost entirely mobilized manner" serving more to support the goals of the Israeli government and IDF than to objectively report the news. "The media created a general atmosphere of complete and absolute support and justification of the war, and systematically suppressed questions that arose as early as the first day of fighting... The criticism gradually increased toward the end of the war-as it became clearer that the IDF was not managing to win. But the general spirit of the war coverage, in the broad strategic sense, as utterly uncritical." Keshev's report documents a post-war memo from the Deputy CEO of Marketing for the Hebrew newspaper [[Maariv]] to Maariv employees which states, in part, that {{cquote|Even when we had problematic material related to the management of the war...we restrained ourselves. In a certain sense, we betrayed our role as journalists, but we did so because we took national, patriotic considerations into account and decided that in the event of war, and certainly a war which was not progressing as it should and was going awry, we were part of the Country; that it was permissible, and even required of us, to postpone disputes and criticism; and that we did not have to apologize, or to feel abashed, for our support and backing of the Army and the Government.<ref name = Keshev1/>}}

According to the report, "significant coverage of the decision-making process was almost entirely absent in Israel's media" at the beginning of the war and reports on the status of Israelis living in the North who did not receive proper governmental support were marginalized. Further, the report states that the media unreasonably centered on the question of the loyalties of Arab-Israelis in the North instead of focusing on inadequate provision of services by the state. The report acknowledges that the Israeli media reported on Lebanese suffering, But states that it divorced the suffering from the IDF operations causing it. Finally, with regard to diplomacy, Israeli media buried the stories on negotiations to reflect the derision held by decision-makers toward a diplomatic solution.<ref name = Keshev1/>

On 18 July 2006 Hezbollah Press Officer Hussein Nabulsi took CNN's [[Nic Robertson]] on an exclusive tour of southern Beirut. Robertson noted that despite his minder's anxiety about explosions in the area, it was clear that Hezbollah had sophisticated media relations and were in control of the situation. Hezbollah designated the places that they went to, and the journalists "certainly didn't have time to go into the houses or lift up the rubble to see what was underneath." According to his reports, there was no doubt that the bombs were hitting Hezbollah facilities, and while there appeared to be "a lot of civilian damage, a lot of civilian properties," he reiterated that he couldn't verify the civilian nature of the destroyed buildings.<ref name="reliable">{{Cite news|title=CNN Reliable Sources, Coverage of Mideast Conflict|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0607/23/rs.01.html|publisher=CNN|date=23 July 2006|accessdate=25 November 2011 }}</ref>

Social and online media were important for providing alternate means of creating and disseminating accounts and political commentary.

On 3 October, an Israeli fighter penetrated the {{convert|2|nmi|km|0|sing=on}} defence perimeter of the French frigate ''[[Courbet (F 712)|Courbet]]'' without answering radio calls, triggering a diplomatic incident.<ref>{{fr icon}} [http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/20061110.FIG000000186_l_armee_francaise_au_liban_se_sent_menacee_par_israel.html L'arm<U+00E9>e fran<U+00E7>aise au Liban se sent menac<U+00E9>e par Isra<U+00EB>l], ''[[Le Figaro]]''</ref>

On 24 October, six [[Israeli Air Force|Israeli]] [[F-16]]s flew over a [[German Navy]] vessel patrolling off Israel's coast just south of the Lebanese border. The German Defence Ministry said that the planes had given off infrared decoys and one of the aircraft had fired two shots into the air, which had not been specifically aimed. The Israeli military said that a German helicopter took off from the vessel without having coordinated this with Israel, and denied vehemently having fired any shots at the vessel and said "as of now" it also had no knowledge of the jets launching flares over it. Israeli Defence Minister [[Amir Peretz]] telephoned his German counterpart [[Franz Josef Jung]] to clarify that 'Israel has no intention to carry out any aggressive actions' against the German peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, who are there as part of [[UNIFIL]] to enforce an arms embargo against Hezbollah. Germany confirmed the consultations, and that both sides were interested in maintaining good cooperation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.teluguportal.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=18958|title=Germany, Israel confirm naval vessel-planes incident|date=October 2006|publisher=Telugu Portal|accessdate=25 November 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.monstersandcritics.com/middleeast/article_1214671.php/Germany_Israel_confirm_naval_vessel-planes_incident|title=Germany, Israel confirm naval vessel-planes incident|date=October 2006|publisher=Middle East News|accessdate=25 November 2011 }}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://story.malaysiasun.com/index.php/ct/9/cid/b8de8e630faf3631/id/ba4623e8cf1e387d/|title=Israel denies firing shots at German ship|date=October 2006|publisher=[[Ynetnews]]|accessdate=25 November 2011 }}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref>

On 1 December 2006, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan submitted a report to the Security Council president maintaining "there were no serious incidents or confrontations" since the cease-fire in August 2006. He did, however, note that peacekeepers reported air violations by Israel "almost on a daily basis," which Israel maintained were a security measure related to continuing Syrian and Iranian arms shipments to Hezbollah, and evidence of the presence of unauthorized armed personnel, assets, and weapons in Lebanon.<ref name="iht_vio_challenge">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/02/news/UN_GEN_UN_Lebanon_Peacekeepers.php|title=Annan: Israel's actions compromise efforts to stabilize the Israeli-Lebanon border|work=International Herald Tribune|date=29 March 2009|accessdate=16 January 2011}}</ref> In one case, a UNIFIL demining team was challenged by two Hezbollah members in combat uniforms armed with [[AK-47|AK-47 rifles]]; UNIFIL notified the Lebanese army, who arrested three suspects the next day.<ref name="iht_vio_challenge"/> There were also "13 instances where UNIFIL came across unauthorized arms or related material in its area of operation", including the discovery of 17 katyusha rockets and several improvised explosive devices in [[Rachaiya El-Foukhar]], and the discovery of a weapons cache containing seven missiles, three rocket launchers, and a substantial amount of ammunition in the area of [[Bourhoz]].<ref name="iht_vio_challenge"/><ref name="ynet_annan_report">Ynet News (2 December 2006).

After the war, the Lebanese Army deployed 15,000 soldiers, backed by a UNIFIL force of 12,000, deployed South of the [[Litani River]] to replace Hezbollah, although the Lebanese government said that it cannot and will not disarm Hezbollah by force. On 7 February 2010, the Lebanese Army fired at an Israeli bulldozer on the border, and Israeli forces returned fire. There were no reported casualties. Lebanon claimed that the bulldozer had crossed the border and entered Lebanese territory. On 21 February 2007, [[Lebanese Army]] troops fired at an Israeli UAV over [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] with small arms, causing no damage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Porat|first=Elisha|url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=52232|title=Lebanese army fires at Israeli UAV|work=Jerusalem Post|location=Israel|date=21 February 2007|accessdate=16 January 2011}}</ref>

On 30 June 2007, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-Moon]]'s [[Fourth report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701|fourth report on the implementation of SC Resolution 1701]] fingered Israel, Lebanon and Hezbollah for violating the ceasefire, but called the firing of rockets into Israel by unknown elements "the most serious breach of the cessation of hostilities since the end of the war." The report commended Israel on its restraint following this attack, and commended Lebanon for its continued efforts to disarm armed groups. It further stated that in spite of "flexibility by Israel beyond the framework of UNSC-Resolution 1701, implementation of the resolution's humanitarian aspects has not yet been possible."<ref name=forthReportOfTheSecretaryGeneral>[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=2&article_id=83440 Report of the secretary general on the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701], ''The Daily Star''. 30 June 2007.</ref>
