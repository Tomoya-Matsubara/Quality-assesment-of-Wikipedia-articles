Duke retired his jersey on February 4, 2007.<ref>{{cite web | title =Williams and Redick Will Have Numbers Retired by Duke this Season | work =GoDuke.com | publisher =Duke Sports Information | date =January 20, 2007 | url =http://www.goduke.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=4200&ATCLID=745550 | accessdate = January 20, 2007 }}</ref>

==High school career==
Redick was a [[McDonald's All-American Game|McDonalds All-American]] at [[Cave Spring High School (Roanoke, Virginia)|Cave Spring High School]] in Roanoke, Virginia.<ref name="Duke"/>
He scored 43 points as a senior in the Virginia state championship game, a game in which the Knights defeated [[George Wythe High School]] of Richmond.

==College career==
In his freshman year at Duke, he led his team with 30 points in their victory over [[North Carolina State University|North Carolina State]] in the ACC Tournament championship game. He put up 26 points against [[Central Michigan University|Central Michigan]] in the second round of the [[2003 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]].<ref name="Duke"/> However, he struggled in Duke's Sweet Sixteen loss to the [[University of Kansas|Kansas Jayhawks]] hitting only two of 16 shots.<ref>{{cite web | title =Duke at Kansas| work =ESPN.com| publisher =ESPN Internet Ventures| date =March 27, 2003| url =http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/boxscore?gameId=234000014| accessdate = January 30, 2007 }}</ref>

Redick served as co-captain in his junior year, along with senior [[point guard]] [[Daniel Ewing]].<ref name="USA"/> He also served as captain his senior year, along with fellow seniors [[Shelden Williams]], [[Sean Dockery]] and [[Lee Melchionni]].<ref>{{cite web | title =Melchionni Named Duke Basketball Captain | work =GoDuke.com | publisher =Duke Sports Information | date =October 22, 2005 | url =http://www.goduke.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=4200&ATCLID=206729 | accessdate = January 20, 2007 }}</ref>

In the 2004<U+2013>05 season, Redick led Duke in scoring with 21.8 points per game. He won the ACC Player of the Year award, and the [[Adolph Rupp Trophy|Adolph F. Rupp Trophy]] for national player of the year.<ref name="USA"/> Redick's victory in the Rupp voting spoiled the consensus for [[University of Utah|Utah]]'s [[Andrew Bogut]], who won every other major player of the year award. In 2006, after facing close competition all year from [[Gonzaga University|Gonzaga]] player [[Adam Morrison]], Redick won the major player of the year awards.

Redick set the record for the most consecutive free throws made in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] with 54.<ref name="Duke"/> This record began on March 20, 2003 and ended on January 15, 2004. Redick entered his final post-season with a chance to go down as the NCAA's all-time leading free-throw shooter. The record, 91.3%, was held at the time by [[Gary Buchanan]] of [[Villanova University|Villanova]]. In an otherwise triumphant visit to [[Greensboro Coliseum]] for the 2006 ACC Tournament and early NCAA Tournament games, J.J. struggled at the line, lowering his career free-throw percentage by about 0.5% and finishing his career with 91.16% (660 out of 724).

On February 14, 2006, in the first half of a game against [[Wake Forest University|Wake Forest]], Redick broke [[University of Virginia|Virginia]] alumnus [[Curtis Staples]]'s NCAA record of 413 career three-pointers made.<ref>{{cite web | title =Redick sets 3-point mark as No. 2 Duke cruises | work =ESPN.com | publisher =ESPN Internet Ventures | date =February 14, 2006 | url =http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=260450150 | accessdate = January 20, 2007 }}</ref>
[[Keydren Clark]] of [[Saint Peter's College, New Jersey|Saint Peter's College]] subsequently surpassed Redick's mark in the [[Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference|MAAC]] Tournament. However, Redick returned the favor by hitting 15 three-pointers in the ACC Tournament and 12 in the NCAA Tournament to finish ahead of Clark. Redick finished his career with an NCAA-record 457 three-point field goals shooting 40.4% from three-point range.<ref name="USA"/>

In the game after breaking Staples' record, Redick scored 30 points on February 19, 2006, against [[University of Miami|Miami]] to become the all-time leading scorer at Duke, with 2,557 points scored in his career.<ref>{{cite web | title =Redick sets Duke career scoring mark in win over Miami | work =ESPN.com | publisher =ESPN Internet Ventures | date =February 19, 2006 | url =http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=260500150 | accessdate = January 20, 2007 }}</ref> On February 25, 2006, in a game at [[Temple University]], Redick passed [[Dickie Hemric]]'s 51-year-old ACC scoring record of 2,587 points with a pair of free throws in the waning minutes of the game. His record was topped in one of the opening round games of the 2009 NCAA tournament by North Carolina Tar Heel [[Tyler Hansbrough]]. Redick finished his career with 2,769 points.<ref>{{cite web | title =Record to Redick, but Williams' muscle carries Duke | work =ESPN.com | publisher =ESPN Internet Ventures | date =February 25, 2006 | url =http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=260560218 | accessdate = January 20, 2007 }}</ref>

On March 10, 2006, in an ACC Tournament quarterfinal against [[University of Miami|Miami]], Redick scored 25 points, setting a Duke record for points in a season with 858. Redick ended the season with 964 points.<ref>{{cite web | title =Notes: Duke 80, Miami 76 | work =GoDuke.com | publisher =Duke Sports Information | date =March 10, 2006 | url =http://www.goduke.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=22726&SPID=1845&DB_OEM_ID=4200&ATCLID=247281 | accessdate = January 20, 2007 }}</ref> Redick came up just short of the ACC record for points scored in a season, which was set by [[Dennis Scott (basketball)|Dennis Scott]] with 970 points in 1990. Redick also finished his career as the leading scorer in ACC tournament history.<ref name="USA"/> His total of 225 points eclipsed Wake Forest's [[Len Chappell]], who scored 220 points in the tournament from 1960<U+2013>62.

As the marquee player of the Duke Blue Devils, Redick was the target of abuse by opposing fans. Travis Clay, of CBS Sportsline, called him the "most hated current athlete in America."<ref name="CBS">{{cite web| last =Clay| first =Travis| title =ClayNation: The most hated (current) athlete in America| work =CBS SportsLine.com| publisher =CBS Interactive, Inc| date =June 27, 2006| url =http://cbs.sportsline.com/spin/story/9527961| accessdate = January 30, 2007 }}</ref> After students from rivals [[University of Maryland, College Park|Maryland]] and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina]] discovered his cell phone number, Redick estimated that he received 50 to 75 hate calls per day from opposing fans. He was often the target of obscenity-laced tirades from fans.

He had 36 double-figure scoring games in a single season, tied as of March 28, 2010, for 5th-most in Duke history with [[Jon Scheyer]], [[Shane Battier]], and [[Jay Williams (basketball)|Jason Williams]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goduke.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=22724&SPID=1845&DB_OEM_ID=4200&ATCLID=204918040 |title=Notes: Duke 78, Baylor 71 <U+2013> Duke University Blue Devils &#124; Official Athletics Site |publisher=GoDuke.com |date= |accessdate=March 29, 2010}}</ref>

On February 4, 2007, Redick's #4 jersey was retired at Cameron Indoor Stadium at a special halftime ceremony. Redick became the thirteenth Duke player to have his jersey retired.

==Early NBA career (2006<U+2013>2009)==
Redick was selected with the 11th pick in the [[2006 NBA Draft]] by the [[Orlando Magic]]. Pre-draft scouting reports praised Redick's perimeter shooting and basketball intelligence, but questioned his defensive ability and speculated that he may not be tall or athletic enough to create his own shots in the NBA.<ref name="Draft"/><ref name="ESPNdraft">{{cite web | title =2006 Draft: J.J. Redick | work =ESPN.com | publisher =ESPN Internet Ventures | url =http://insider.espn.go.com/nbadraft/draft/tracker/player?playerId=18853 | accessdate = January 20, 2007 }}</ref> This scouting report was highlighted when Duke played LSU in the 2006 NCAA tournament.  LSU's [[Garrett Temple]], a 6'5" guard known for his athleticism and a large wingspan, chased Redick throughout the game.  Taken out of his normal rhythm, Redick, the number two scorer in the nation at the time, ended with one of his worst performances shooting 3-for-18 from the field and scoring 11 points in a game Duke lost.

In an interview with the ''[[Charlotte Observer]]'', Redick said, "I think I'll be a role player like 80 percent of the players in the league are. I don't expect to be a star, I'll just shoot, be a team player."<ref>{{cite web | last =Fowler | first =Scott | title =Redick's last shot | work =Charlotte Observer | date =November 10, 2005 | url =http://www.charlotte.com/mld/charlotte/sports/13128092.htm | accessdate = January 20, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> He moved up into the backup shooting guard position behind well-known veteran and Duke alum [[Grant Hill (basketball)|Grant Hill]].<ref>{{cite news | last =Reed | first =Travis | title =Once a Star, Redick Scarcely Playing in NBA | work =NBA.com | agency =Associated Press | date =January 11, 2007 | url =http://www.nba.com/nba_news/redick_playing_070111.html | accessdate = January 20, 2007 }}</ref> As a professional, Redick was getting limited playing time, but after an injury to Hill, Redick moved up in the rotation. Redick, compared to the rest of his rookie season, caught his stride in the beginning of February, hitting double figures in 4 out of 5 games and averaging 9 points in all.

Redick competed against [[Trevor Ariza]] and [[Keith Bogans]] for the starting shooting guard spot in 2007<U+2013>08. He was pulled from playing more than once for his lack of defense during the preseason.<ref>{{cite web|last=Denton |first=John |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/magic/2007-10-20-redick_N.htm |title=Redick's shooting woes, defense may limit role |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=October 20, 2007 |accessdate=March 29, 2010}}</ref> He came into the season as a third stringer and saw limited action due to [[back spasm]]s, but moved into limited rotation after Ariza was traded to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] early in the season. In January 2008, Redick posted in his personal blog that said he's "frustrated because it's been proven that even if I play well in the limited minutes I get that not much is going to change."<ref>{{cite web|author=Greg Nelson/SI |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0801/nba.players.need.change.scenery/content.10.html |title=SI.com <U+2013> Photo Gallery <U+2013> Players in Need of a New Team |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=March 29, 2010}}</ref>

It was reported on January 31, 2008, that Redick asked his agent, [[Arn Tellem]], to see about a possible trade. "We want to see what's out there," Redick told the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'', "I want to stay here, but it's been frustrating."  Magic coach [[Stan Van Gundy]] responded: "Right now it would be very hard to fit him in. I know it's also hard to keep sitting him on the bench... Should we be playing him? Right now we're going good so we probably won't disrupt things."<ref>{{cite news | title =Lack of playing time frustrates Redick, prompts inquiry about trade | work =ESPN.com | agency =Associated Press | date =January 31, 2008 | url =http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3223848 | accessdate = February 6, 2008 }}</ref>  The [[Orlando Magic]] confirmed Van Gundy's comments by stating that Redick would not receive more minutes or a trade before the Feb. 21st [[trade deadline]].<ref>{{cite news | title =Redick, still stuck on bench, likely won't be traded | work =ESPN.com | agency =Associated Press | date =February 5, 2008 | url =http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3232792 | accessdate = February 6, 2008 }}</ref> In the last game of the season, with the playoff seed locked up, Redick received more time than he had all season and led the Magic with 18 points, for the first time in his career.

In the 2008<U+2013>2009 season, Redick's minutes began to pick up, averaging 17.4 minutes instead of the previous season's 8.1, and playing in 64 games instead of 34.<ref name="pf">{{cite web|url=http://www.realgm.com/src_playerfile/666/jj_redick/ |title=Player Profiles <U+2013> J.J.

==Current NBA career (2009<U+2013>present)==
On November 1, 2009, Redick achieved a career high with the Magic, scoring 27 points against Toronto, including 5 of 8 in three-point-shots,<ref>{{cite web|author=1:00 PM ET, November 1, 2009Air Canada Centre, Toronto, ON |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=291101028 |title=Orlando Magic vs. Toronto Raptors <U+2013> Box Score <U+2013> November 1, 2009 <U+2013> ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=November 1, 2009 |accessdate=March 29, 2010}}</ref> and 6 of 7 from the free-throw line.

Backup swingman [[Mickael Pietrus]] was also injured, leaving Redick to play the entire game.  He also led the team in scoring, with 23 points, and had just one turnover.<ref name="boxscore"></ref>

In 2005, he competed with the [[USA Basketball]] Under-21 Team, in [[Frisco, Texas]], which won gold medals at the World Championships and the Global Games. In 2006, Redick was named to the [[United States national basketball team|USA Men's]] 2006<U+2013>2008 National Team Program.
