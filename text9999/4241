==Career==
Hansberry attended the [[University of Wisconsin<U+2013>Madison]], but found college to be uninspiring and left in 1950 to pursue her career as a writer in New York City, where she attended [[The New School]].<ref name="Carter 1980, p. 41">Carter 1980, p. 41.</ref> She worked on the staff of the Black newspaper ''Freedom'' under the auspices of [[Paul Robeson]], and also worked with [[W. E. B. DuBois]], whose office was in the same building.<ref name="Carter 1980, p. 41"/> ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'' was written at this time, and was a huge success. It was the first play written by an [[African American|African-American]] woman to be produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. At 29 years, she became the youngest American playwright and only the 5th woman to receive the [[New York Drama Critics Circle Award]] for Best Play.<ref>Carter 1980, p. 42.</ref> While many of her other writings were published in her lifetime - essays, articles, and the text for the SNCC book ''The Movement'', the only other play given a contemporary production was ''[[The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window]]''.<ref name="Carter 1980, p. 43"/>

In 1961, Hansberry was set to replace [[Vinnette Carroll]] as the director of the musical, ''Kicks and Co,'' after its try-out at Chicago's McCormick Place.  It was written by [[Oscar Brown|Oscar Brown, Jr.]] and featured an interracial cast including Lonnie Sattin,  [[Nichelle Nichols]], Vi Velasco, [[Al Freeman, Jr.]], Zabeth Wilde and [[Burgess Meredith]] in the title role of Mr. Kicks.  A satire involving [[miscegenation]], the $400,000 production was co-produced by her husband Robert Nemiroff, but despite a warm reception in the Windy City, the show never made it to Broadway.<ref name='Jet-12JOct1961'>{{cite journal |last=Still |first=Larry |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor1-first=John H. |editor1-last=Johnson |editor1-link= |date=October 12, 1961 |year= |month= |title=Oscar Brown musical gets warm reception in windy city |trans_title= |journal=Jet |volume=20 |series= |issue=25 |page= |pages=58<U+2013>61 |at= |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company, Inc. |location=Chicago, Illinois |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url= |language= |format= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |laysummary= |laysource= |laydate= |quote=After the first showing, co-producers Burt Charles D'Lugoff and Robert Nemiroff announced that original director Vinnette Carroll would be replaced by Nemiroff's wife, prize-winning playwright Lorraine (''A Raisin In The Sun'') Hansberry in her first major directing spot.|ref= |separator= |postscript= }}</ref>

Baldwin believed "it is not at all farfetched to suspect that what she saw contributed to the strain which killed her, for the effort to which Lorraine was dedicated is more than enough to kill a man."<ref>Baldwin, James, ''Sweet Lorraine,'' ''introduction to'' Hansberry, Lorraine, '' To Be Young, Gifted and Black: An Informal Autobiography'' (Signet Paperback 1970), pxiv, ISBN 0-451-15952-7.</ref> Hansberry's funeral was held in Harlem on January 15, 1965. Paul Robeson gave her eulogy. The presiding reverend, Eugene Callender, recited messages from James Baldwin and the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. which read: "Her creative ability and her profound grasp of the deep social issues confronting the world today will remain an inspiration to generations yet unborn."  She is buried at [[Asbury United Methodist Church and Bethel Chapel and Cemetery|Asbury United Methodist Church Cemetery]] in [[Croton-on-Hudson, New York]].<ref name="nrhpinv_ny">{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=10889|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Asbury United Methodist Church and Bethel Chapel and Cemetery|date=August 1999|accessdate=2010-12-24 |author=Peter D.

In [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], ''The Lorraine Hansberry Theatre'', which specializes in original stagings and revivals of African-American theatre, is named in her honor. Singer and pianist [[Nina Simone]], who was a close friend of Hansberry, used the title of her unfinished play to write a [[civil rights]]-themed song "[[To Be Young, Gifted and Black]]" together with [[Weldon Irvine]]. The single reached the top 10 of the [[R&B]] charts.<ref>[http://www.boscarol.com/ninasimone/pages/php/show_song.php?id=tobeyounggifted The Nina Simone Database, "To Be Young, Gifted and Black" (1969)]</ref> A studio recording by Simone was released as a single and the first live recording on October 26, 1969 was captured on ''[[Black Gold (album)|Black Gold]]'' (1970).
