'''Falaise''' was a railway station in the [[France|French]] town of [[Falaise, Calvados]].

The station was built by the [[Chemins de Fer de l'Ouest|CF de l'Ouest]] in pure ''Ouest'' architecture, and opened on 1 November 1859. It saw the arrival of a line from [[Flers]] ([[Berjou-Pont-d'Ouilly]]) on 15 April 1874 and from [[Gare de Falaise-Ch<U+00E2>teau|Falaise-Ch<U+00E2>teau]] by the [[Chemins de Fer du Calvados|Calvados]] railway in 1904 ({{RailGauge|0.6m}}).

The ''main line'' to [[Caen]] closed on 1 July 1953 and the ''branch line'' from Berjou on 1 March 1938. at the birth of the [[SNCF]]. The narrow gauge line closed in 1932.

The site of the former station was recently redevelopped and a supermarket built where the building once stood.
