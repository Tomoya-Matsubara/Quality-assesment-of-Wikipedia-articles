In [[physics]], the '''proton''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{polytonic|<U+03C0><U+03C1><U+1FF6><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03BD>}}'' ''proton'' = first) is a [[subatomic particle]] with an [[electric charge]] of one positive [[elementary charge|fundamental unit]] (1.602 <U+00D7> 10<sup><U+2212>19</sup> [[coulomb]]), a diameter of about 1.5<U+00D7>10<sup><U+2212>15</sup> [[meter|m]], and a mass of 938.27231(28) [[MeV]]/''[[Speed of light|c]]''<sup>2</sup> ([[1 E-27 kg|1.6726 <U+00D7> 10<sup><U+2212>27</sup> kg]]), 1.007 276 466 88(13) [[unified atomic mass unit|u]] or about 1836 times the mass of an [[electron]].

Protons are [[spin (physics)|spin]]-1/2 [[fermion]]s and are composed of three [[quark]]s, {{fact|date=April 2007}} making them [[baryon]]s. The two [[up quark]]s and one [[down quark]] of the proton are also held together by the [[strong interaction|strong nuclear force]], mediated by [[gluon]]s.

Protons and [[neutron]]s are both [[nucleon]]s, which may be bound by the [[nuclear force]] into [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]]. The most common [[isotope]] of the [[hydrogen]] [[atom]] is a single proton (it contains no neutrons). The nuclei of other atoms are composed of various numbers of protons and neutrons. The number of protons in the nucleus determines the chemical properties of the atom and which [[chemical element]] it is.

==Stability==
The proton is observed to be [[stable isotope|stable]]. However, protons are known to transform into [[neutron]]s through the process of [[electron capture]]. This process does not occur spontaneously but only when energy is supplied.

: <math>\mathrm{p}^+ + \mathrm{e}^- \rightarrow\mathrm{n} + {\nu}_e \,</math>

The process is reversible: neutrons can convert back to protons through [[beta decay]], a common form of [[radioactive decay]].

[[Grand unified theory|Grand unified theories]] generally predict that [[proton decay]] should take place, although experiments so far have only resulted in a lower limit of 10<sup>35</sup> years for the proton's lifetime.

==In chemistry==
In [[chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]], the proton is thought of as the [[hydrogen]] [[ion]], denoted H<sup>+</sup>. In this context, a proton donor is an [[acid]] and a proton acceptor is a [[base (chemistry)|base]] (see [[acid-base reaction theories]]). However it should be noted that the hydrogen ion is not observed in aqueous solution; instead we observe the [[hydronium]] ion, which is considered a proton donating ion.

==History==
[[Ernest Rutherford]] is generally credited with the discovery of the proton. In 1918 Rutherford noticed that when alpha particles were shot into nitrogen gas, his [[scintillation detector]]s showed the signatures of hydrogen nuclei. Rutherford determined that the only place this hydrogen could have come from was the nitrogen, and therefore nitrogen must contain hydrogen nuclei. He thus suggested that the hydrogen nucleus, which was known to have an [[atomic number]] of 1, was an [[elementary particle]].

Prior to Rutherford, [[Eugene Goldstein]] had observed [[canal rays]], which were composed of positively charged [[ion]]s.  After the discovery of the [[electron]] by [[J.J. Thomson]], Goldstein suggested that since the atom is electrically neutral there must be a positively charged particle in the atom and tried to discover it.  He used the "canal rays" observed to be moving against the electron flow in [[cathode ray tubes]].  After the electron had been removed from  particles inside the cathode ray tube they became positively charged and moved towards the cathode. Most of the charged particles passed through the cathode, it being perforated, and produced a glow on the glass.  At this point, Goldstein believed that he had discovered the proton.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  When he calculated the ratio of charge to mass of this new particle (which in case of the electron was found to be the same for every gas that was used in the cathode ray tube) was found to be different when the gases used were changed. The reason was simple. What Goldstein assumed to be a proton was actually an ion. He gave up his work there. But promised that "he would return." However, he was widely ignored.

==Antiproton==
{{main|antiproton}}

The [[antiparticle]] of the proton is the '''antiproton'''. It was discovered in 1955 by [[Emilio Segr<U+00E8>]] and [[Owen Chamberlain]], for which they were awarded the 1959 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].

[[CPT-symmetry]] puts strong constraints on the relative properties of particles and [[antiparticles]] and, therefore, is open to stringent tests. For example, the charges of the proton and antiproton must sum to exactly zero. This equality has been tested to one part in 10<sup>8</sup>. The equality of their masses is also tested to better than one part in 10<sup>8</sup>. By holding antiprotons in a [[Penning trap]], the equality of the charge to mass ratio of the proton and the antiproton has been tested to 1 part in 9<U+00D7>10<sup>11</sup>. The [[magnetic moment]] of the antiproton has been measured with error of 8<U+00D7>10<sup><U+2212>3</sup> nuclear [[Bohr magneton]]s, and is found to be equal and opposite to that of the proton.

==High-energy physics==
Due to their stability and large mass (compared to [[electron]]s), protons are well suited to use in [[particle collider]]s such as the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]] and the [[Tevatron]] at [[Fermilab]]. Protons also make up a large majority of the [[cosmic ray]]s which impinge on the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. Such high-energy proton collisions are more complicated to study than electron collisions, due to the composite nature of the proton. Understanding the details of proton structure requires [[quantum chromodynamics]].
