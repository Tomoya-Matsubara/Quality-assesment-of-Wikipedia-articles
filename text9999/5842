'''Djibouti''' ({{lang-ar|'''<big> <U+062C><U+064A><U+0628><U+0648><U+062A><U+064A> </big>'''}} ''J<U+012B>b<U+016B>t<U+012B>'', [[Somali language|Somali]]: ''Jabuuti''), officially the '''Republic of Djibouti''', is a country in the [[Horn of Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Eritrea]] in the north, [[Ethiopia]] in the west and south, and [[Somalia]] in the southeast. The remainder of the border is formed by the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Aden]]. On the other side of the Red Sea, on the [[Arabian Peninsula]], 20 kilometres (12&nbsp;mi) from the coast of Djibouti, is [[Yemen]]. Djibouti's size is just over 23,000&nbsp;km<U+00B2> with an estimated population of under	500,000. Its capital is the city of [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti]].

==History==
{{main|History of Djibouti}}
The history of Djibouti is recorded in poetry and in songs of its nomadic people and goes back thousands of years to a time when Djiboutians traded hides and skins for the perfumes and spices of ancient [[Egypt]], [[India]], and [[China]]. Through close contacts with the Arabian peninsula for more than 1,000 years, the [[Somali people|Somali]] and [[Afar people|Afar]] tribes in this region became among the first on the African continent to accept [[Islam]].

French interest developed in the nineteenth century when the area was ruled by the [[sultan]] of '''Raheita, Tadjoura and Gobaad'''. The French bought the anchorage of Obock in 1862 and expanded it eventually to a colony called '''French Somaliland''' with essentially the current boundaries. In 1967 the area became the '''[[French Territory of the Afars and the Issas]]'''.

The Republic of Djibouti gained its independence from [[France]] on [[June 27]],[[1977]]. Djibouti is a Somali, Afar and Islamic country which regularly takes part in Islamic affairs as well as Arab meetings.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Djibouti}}
Djibouti is a [[Semi-presidential republic|semi-presidential]] [[republic]], with [[executive power]] in the central government, and [[legislative power]] in both the government and parliament. The parliamentary party system is dominated by the [[People's Rally for Progress]] and the President who currently is [[Ismail Omar Guelleh]]. The country's current constitution was approved in September 1992. Djibouti is a [[Dominant-party system|one party dominant state]] with the People's Rally for Progress in power. Opposition parties are allowed, but have no real chance of gaining power (''see'' [[Elections in Djibouti]]).

The government is seen as being controlled by the Somali Issa clan. The country has recently come out of a decade long [[Djiboutian Civil War|civil war]], with the government and the [[Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy]] (FRUD) signing a peace treaty in 2000. Two FRUD members are part of the current cabinet.

Djibouti's second president, Guelleh was first elected to office in 1999, taking over from  [[Hassan Gouled Aptidon]], who had ruled the country since its independence from France in 1977.<ref>{{cite web |title=DJIBOUTI: Guelleh sworn in for second presidential term |url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=47007 |accessmonthday=December 4 |accessyear=2005}}</ref> Despite elections of the 1990s being described as "generally fair", Guelleh was sworn in for his second and final six year term as president in a one-man race on [[8 April]] [[2005]]. He took 100% of the votes in a 78.9% turnout.

The prime minister, who follows the council of ministers ('cabinet'), is appointed by the President. The parliament - the ''Chambre des D<U+00E9>put<U+00E9>s'' - consists of 52 members who are selected every five to nine years.

In 2001, the Djiboutian government leased the former [[French Foreign Legion]] base [[Camp Lemonier]] to the [[United States]]. Camp Lemonier is being used for fighting terrorism in the region, mainly performing airstrikes on suspected terrorist targets in the Somalian territory by the [[CENTCOM|United States Central Command]] as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].

France's [[13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade]] shares [[Camp Lemonier]] with the [[CJTF-HOA|Combined Joint Task Force Horn of Africa]] (CJTF-HOA) of the [[United States Central Command]], which arrived in 2002. It is from Djibouti that [[Abu Ali al-Harithi]], suspected mastermind of the 2000 [[USS Cole bombing]], and U.S. citizen [[Ahmed Hijazi]], along with four others persons, lost their lives in 2002 while riding a car in [[Yemen]], by a [[Hellfire missile]] sent by a [[RQ-1 Predator|RQ-1 Predator drone]] actioned from CIA headquarters in [[Langley, Virginia]].<ref> [http://mondediplo.com/2003/02/06djibouti Djibouti: a new army behind the wire], ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', February 2003 {{en icon}} (+ {{fr icon}}/{{pt icon}}) </ref> It is also from there that the U.S. Army launched attacks in 2007 against [[War in Somalia (2006<U+2013>present)|Islamic forces in Somalia]]. 

Djibouti is a member of the [[Arab League]], as well as the [[African Union]], and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Djibouti}}
[[Image:DjiboutiLacAssal2.jpg|left|300px|thumb|[[Lac Assal]] area]]
Djibouti lies in northeast Africa on the Gulf of Aden at the southern entrance to the Red Sea. Djibouti has {{convert|314|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of coastline and shares a {{convert|113|km|mi|0|abbr=on|sing=on}} border with Eritrea, {{convert|337|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} with Ethiopia and {{convert|58|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} with Somalia (total {{convert|506|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=/}}). The country is mainly a stony desert, with scattered plateaus and highlands.
{{clear}}

==Regions and districts==
[[Image:Djibouti-regions.png|right|190px|Map of the regions of Djibouti]]
{{main|Regions of Djibouti|Districts of Djibouti}}

Djibouti is sectioned into 5 [[Regions of Djibouti|regions]] and one [[city]]. It is further subdivided into 11 [[districts]].

The regions and city are:
* [[Ali Sabieh Region]] (''Region d'Ali Sabieh'')
* [[Arta Region]] (''Region d'Arta'')
* [[Dikhil Region]] (''Region de Dikhil'')
* [[Djibouti (city)]] (''Ville de Djibouti'')
* [[Obock Region]] (''Region d'Obock'')
* [[Tadjourah Region]] (''Region de Tadjourah'')

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Djibouti}}  
[[Image:Port of Djibouti.jpg|thumb|left|Fishing boats docked at the [[Port of Djibouti]].]]
The economy of Djibouti is based on service activities connected with the country's strategic location and status as a free trade zone in northeast Africa. Two-thirds of the inhabitants live in the capital city, the remainder being mostly nomadic herders. Scant rainfall limits crop production to [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]], and most food must be imported.

In April 2005, the United Nations [[World Food Programme]] warned that 30,000 people in Djibouti face serious food shortages following three years of poor rains.<ref>[http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&Key=1295 Djibouti drought threatens 30,000 with grave food shortages], 29 April 2005, World Food Programme. Retrieved August 4, 2007.</ref>

Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the region and an international transshipment and refueling center. It has few natural resources and little [[industry]]. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance development projects. Daniel R. Sutton, an American salt miner, is also overseeing some $70 million operation to industrialize the collection of Djibouti<U+2019>s plentiful salt in the Region Lake Asal. There are gold miners from India, geothermal experts from Iceland, Turkish hotel managers, Saudi oil engineers, French bankers and American military contractors. Tycoons from Dubai are also pumping in a billion dollars just on their own, largely for the country<U+2019>s port in an effort to greatly expand the country's port, a gateway to the region, having already leased the port from Djibouti due to the fact that the government was mismanaging it's operation and were losing money. There is even a project on paper to build a multibillion-dollar, 18-mile bridge across the Red Sea, captained by Tarek bin Laden, the half brother of Osama bin Laden.
An [[unemployment]] rate of 40% to 50% continues to be a major problem. [[Inflation]] is not a concern, however, because of the fixed tie of the [[Djiboutian franc|franc]] to the [[U.S. dollar]]. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% over the last seven years because of [[recession]], [[civil war]], and a high [[population growth rate]] (including immigrants and refugees). Renewed fighting between [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]] has been beneficial to Djibouti, the [[Port of Djibouti]] now serving as landlocked Ethiopia's primary link to the sea. Faced with a multitude of economic difficulties, the government has fallen into arrears on long-term external debt and has been struggling to meet the stipulations of foreign aid donors.<ref name=2007factbook />

==Demographics==
[[Image:An Afar nomad.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Afar people|Afar]] man in nomad attire.]]
[[Image:Cadow-pr2.gif|thumb|left|200px|[[Somali people|Somali]] man in traditional ''koofiyad'' [[Fez (hat)|fez]].]]
{{main|Demographics of Djibouti}}

The population consists of two major ethnic groups: the [[Somali people|Somali]] and the [[Afar people|Afar]].

The remainder is formed by [[Europe]]ans (mostly [[French people|French]] and [[Italian people|Italians]]), [[Arab]]s and [[Ethiopia]]ns. Tensions between the Afar and [[Issa (clan)|Issa]] was the cause of the [[Djiboutian Civil War|civil war]] in the early 1990s.

The Somali ethnic component in Djibouti is mainly composed of the Issas, who form the majority and the Gadabuursi and Isaaq, all of whom are closely related as [[Dir (clan)|Dir]] subclans. The Issas form part of the Madoobe Dir, while the Gadabuursi and Isaaq are part of the Mahe Dir, Mohammed Hiniftire.

Although [[French language|French]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are the official languages, [[Somali language|Somali]] and [[Afar language|Afar]] are widely spoken.<ref name=2007factbook />

The bulk of Djibouti's people are urban residents; the remainder are herders. Health, sanitary, and education services are relatively poor in both urban and rural areas.

==Religion==
[[Image:Djibouti mosque.JPG|thumb|left|[[Mosque]] in Djibouti city]]

Djibouti's population is predominantly [[Islam|Muslim]]. Islam is observed by 94% of Djibouti's population (about 444,440), while the remaining six percent, primarily consisting of foreign nationals, follow various [[Christianity|Christian]] traditions.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/dj.html#People CIA World Factbook - Djibouti]</ref>

<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tx.htmlCIA the World Factbook]</ref>

Just like Islam in other countries, every town and village in Djibouti has a [[mosque]] where people go to worship.{{Fact|date=October 2008}} Tombs of their former religious leaders and those considered holy are known as sacred spaces. The most famous sacred space for Islam in Djibouti is the tomb of Sheikh Abu Yazid, which is found in the [[Goda Mountains]].{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

In addition to the Islamic calendar, Muslims in Djibouti also recognize New Year's Day ([[January 1]]) and Labor Day ([[May 1]]) as holidays.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Djibouti}}
[[Image:Farside-2006.1170325620.picture 044.jpg|thumb|Beach in Djibouti City]]

Djiboutian attire reflects the region's hot and arid climate. When not dressed in Westernized clothing such as jeans and t-shirts, men typically wear the ''macawiis'', which is a [[sarong]]-like garment worn around the waist. Among [[nomad]]s, many wear a loosely wrapped white cotton robe called a ''tobe'' that goes down to about the knee, with the end thrown over the shoulder (much like a Roman [[toga]]). Women typically wear the ''dirac'', which is a long, light, diaphanous voile dress made of cotton or [[polyester]] that is worn over a full-length half-slip and a brassiere. Married women tend to sport head-scarves referred to as ''shash'', and also often cover their upper body with a [[shawl]] known as ''garbasaar''. Unmarried or young women, however, do not always cover their heads. Traditional Arabian garb such as the male [[jellabiya]] (''jellabiyaad'' in Somali) and the female [[niqab]] is also commonly worn. For some occasions such as festivals, women may adorn themselves with specialized jewelry and head-dresses similar to those worn by the [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes of the [[Maghreb]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Image of Djibouti women in head-dresses |url=http://www.discoverfrance.net/Colonies/Images/Places/Djibouti/Women_Costumes_Djibouti.jpg |accessmonthday=April 5 |accessyear=2008}}</ref>

A lot of Djibouti's original art is passed on and preserved orally, mainly through song. Many examples of Islamic, Ottoman, and French influences can also be noted in the local buildings, which contain plasterwork, carefully constructed [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] and [[calligraphy]].
