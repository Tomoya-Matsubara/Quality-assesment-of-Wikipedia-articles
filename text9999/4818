The exteriors for the show are shot almost exclusively in [[Stevenson Ranch]], a suburban area of [[Santa Clarita Valley]], [[California]].  The shot of the large fountain and Agrestic sign seen in the introduction was shot at the corner of Stevenson Ranch Parkway and Holmes Place.

==Plot synopsis==
''See main article [[List of Weeds episodes]].''

===Season 1===

The fictional, affluent [[Los Angeles, California]] [[suburbia|suburb]] of [[wiktionary:Agrestic|Agrestic]] which is an English word meaning "characteristic of the fields or country". It could also mean "crude: lacking the qualities associated with sophistication" or it could also be a [[portmanteau]] of aggressive and majestic. It is home to [[Nancy Botwin]], whose husband Judah suddenly died of heart failure while jogging with his son Shane in the beginning of the first season. Nancy's children Silas and Shane both attend Agrestic's [[public school]] system.

Nancy begins dealing marijuana to locals to support her upper middle-class lifestyle. She buys from Heylia James, a major distributor in the Agrestic area whom she met through Conrad, Heylia's nephew. When her customers talk their way into a medical marijuana store with a variety of high-quality pot Nancy's sales dry up, so she utilizes her baking skills and concocts pot-laced brownies to sell off the low-quality product. Later, with the aid of her accountant and customer, councilman Doug Wilson, she sets up a legitimate bakery as a front for her drug sales. Silas begins dating Megan, a deaf girl who lives in the area. Shane, a witness to his father's death, is a more troubled child, and has the nickname "Strange Botwin" at school. He has been known to act out and, for example, bites the foot of another child in a martial arts tournament. 

Nancy befriends the manic, image-obsessed, manipulative and controlling Celia Hodes, president of the Agrestic [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]], who has a number of domestic problems.  She does not get along with her cheating husband Dean, nor does she get along with her older daughter, Quinn (Silas' previous girlfriend), whom she sends off to [[boarding school]] in [[Mexico]] in the premiere. Her younger daughter, Isabelle, is overweight and says she is a [[lesbian]], and Celia berates her cruelly about both issues. Toward the end of the season, Celia is diagnosed with bilateral [[breast cancer]], and before her surgery she has sex with Conrad. Conrad is long-time friends with Andy Botwin, the younger brother of Nancy's late husband and the [[black sheep]] of the family.  Andy says he has moved into the Botwin household to help Nancy out, but seems to just be there to free-load. He decides to study to become a [[rabbi]] to avoid military service in [[Iraq]]. 

Nancy has a brief sexual encounter with a rival drug dealer and then starts dating Peter Scottson, the parent of the kid her son bit in [[karate]] class. The season closes with Nancy's plan to become a grower. However, this plan hits complications when she sleeps with Peter, only to find out he's an agent with the [[Drug Enforcement Agency|DEA]].

===Season 2===

The second season, while still comedic, has a much darker tone, as Nancy becomes increasingly involved in the more dangerous aspects of the drug "underground". Ignoring Heylia's advice, Nancy and Conrad start their own small-scale growing operation and eventually rent a suburban grow-house. She welcomes other people into her business, including her brother-in-law Andy and Doug. During this season, Peter Scottson tells Nancy he knows she is a drug dealer, and the two are married as part of a deal to legally protect Nancy from Peter. While Nancy's drug activities increase, Celia runs for, and wins, Doug's spot on the town council: she launches a drug-free campaign across Agrestic complete with drug-free zone signs and surveillance cameras.  

As the season progresses, Nancy's children become more aware of her illegal activities, though the two sons deal with the issue in quite different ways. Shane continues to have problems fitting in at school, and ultimately takes an interest in Andy's crazy ex-girlfriend, Kat. Silas, on the other hand, takes out his frustrations by committing acts of [[vandalism]], most notably stealing Celia's drug-free zone signs and cameras.

Nancy and Conrad's drug business becomes a hit as Conrad's strain of plant, which [[Snoop Dogg]] dubs "milfweed" during a happenstance meeting at a recording studio, but their high profile causes trouble. Initially, Nancy's marriage to a DEA agent keeps her on top while her [[Armenia]]n rivals are busted, but her marriage to Peter deteriorates as he pressures her to quit dealing. For Nancy, the final straw is when Peter comes over for dinner and manhandles Silas. Nancy calls Conrad and tells him that she doesn't love Peter; Peter hears the conversation with wireless surveillance. 

The season concludes with a complex series of betrayals, as Peter demands of Nancy and Conrad all of the cash from a quick sale of their crop. Secretly, Heylia hires Armenian mobsters to kill Peter in retaliation. Nancy's buyer, U-Turn, demands the entire crop of weed at gunpoint. Having just killed Peter, the Armenian mobsters arrive at the same time and expect the proceeds from the big sale to pay for their hit. Only then does Nancy discover that Silas has decided to force his way into the business by stealing the entire batch of weed and demanding to be part of the business. It is at this time he is approached by Celia and a police officer for the vandalism. This leaves Nancy at the grow house, in a [[Mexican standoff]] with both the gangsters and the mobsters pointing guns at her in a season-ending [[cliffhanger]].

===Season 3===

The third season of Weeds begins with several subplots involving the fallout from the botched drug deal of the season two finale.

'''Nancy'''

As the season opens, Nancy is told that she has until sundown to find the missing weed. Celia finds the stash in the trunk of Silas's car and dumps it in Nancy's pool 'for her own protection', not knowing that she has endangered Nancy's life. Although angry, U-Turn compromises and agrees to take Nancy's debt in labor. Her first task is to pick up a package from a Latin drug gang led by Guillermo, who forces her to "[[brick-dance]]" on a pool table before giving her a bag of "skunk weed". U-Turn is furious about getting the wrong package, blaming Nancy for not picking up the expected [[heroin]], and increases her debt in response.
 
In need of cash, Nancy begins working for Sullivan Groff, the crooked developer of Majestic, a rival community that wants to build a sewage pipeline through Agrestic. At first, Nancy can't stand Sullivan, but the two begin having an affair. Celia finds out about the affair and learns Nancy is still dealing, so Celia decides to blackmail her. This leads to a confrontation between the two women as Nancy threatens Celia with a butcher's knife, and  Shane encounters Celia on the counter, his mother holding the knife at her throat.

U-Turn is impressed with Nancy and is actually in the process of training her to become his lieutenant. This causes a rift between him and Marvin, an associate of his whom he severely debases. When U-Turn is winded Marvin kills him and attempts to take over the operations, but Nancy maneuvers the situation to her advantage and all debts are cleared. This leaves Guillermo's group in control of the drug trade in the city, while Nancy, Conrad and Heylia are now free of their obligations and start their normal sales again.

Nancy also makes a short-lived friendship with Peter's ex-wife Valerie, which falls apart after Nancy is the one left the $119,000 from his life insurance. Nancy offers to pay it to Valerie in installments, but the installments are small, which tears the rift further. Valerie hires a private investigator to find out what Nancy is up to with the insurance money. After Shane installs a new home security system, the outdoor security camera catches the p.i. watching the Botwin residence, Nancy confronts him, where he blackmails her into giving him $50,000 to keep quiet about her dealings. Nancy goes to give him the money and records him acknowledging the blackmail on a hidden microphone, ensuring he has to keep his mouth shut or he goes to jail.

At the end of the season, Nancy finds her family being threatened by a group of bikers that want to push their "ditch weed" through her. In response, she makes a protection deal with Guillermo, leading to tragic consequences for the entire town, and especially Nancy.  To get rid of all the evidence her house is burned down and at the end of the episode she is standing attop of a hill with Guillermo, when she realizes Guillermo had done that for her protection.

'''Andy'''

Andy believes that his missing two toes will exclude him from service, and drops out of rabbinical school. His hopes are quashed when he is told to report for duty anyway, and the expected desk job disappears in [[boot camp]] when he is told he's being shipped to Iraq. He and his training partner are considered the "stooges" of the camp and are eventually left out in the desert to test a missile that trains on cell phone signals which impales the partner and kills him. Andy runs, and is considered [[AWOL]], which they will dismiss if he gives back the phone. When asked why they treated them so horribly, the base officials replied that the test was originally meant to be conducted on a donkey, but they considered a donkey a more valuable resource than the two men.

After being kicked out of the military, Andy is asked by Sullivan Groff to cater for [[pornographic movie|porn movie]] shoots, making friends with porn star Lexington Steele on the set after an embarrassing confession that his last girlfriend used a "Lex Steele" [[dildo]] on him. Andy is featured in a few scenes, mainly for foot fetishes and the loss of his toes. Later, Andy befriends a biker girl whose drug-dealing brother threatens the safety of the Botwins.

'''Shane and Silas'''

Silas is sentenced to community service for the theft of the drug-free signs. Silas talks Nancy into allowing him to sell pot to the other people doing community service, and she grudgingly agrees. While selling the pot at an old age home, Silas meets Tara, a [[born-again Christian]] who eventually starts selling too, rising to become Nancy's best dealer. Trouble brews when Tara admits openly to Silas that she's dating other people.  By the end of the season Silas realizes that her religious beliefs are too much for him and he's over her.

Shane is enrolled in a summer school that frequently violates church and state law to present religious propaganda, such as subjecting the class to a murder mystery where the solution is an [[abortion]]. When Isabelle is also placed in the class, Shane quickly fills her in on what's going on by instantly solving the mysteries, all of which have obvious biblical or creationist answers. Shane is soon ostracized by the other students for his lack of faith, and develops a crush on a religious girl who appears to "save" him. Isabelle rescues him from this fate by stealing her away for her own "salvation". Shane and Isabelle's friendship develops strongly this season; they are seen smoking pot in secret together at one point, and Shane asks Isabelle if she is really a lesbian, to which she asks if he really talks to his dead father. 

In the last few episodes, Shane begins talking to his dead father Judah, leaving Nancy and her family wondering whether Judah's spirit is indeed in the house. It has yet to be revealed whether Shane truly saw his father or not. It is stated that Shane was only pretending to speak with his father's spirit because he wanted to move to [[Pittsburgh]].

'''Other characters'''

To get back at Doug, in season two, Celia ran for Doug's seat on town council, and won because his name was left off the ballot. She introduces a drug-free campaign, whose introduction is disrupted by Shane and then subverted by Silas. As the project fails she becomes increasingly frozen out of the council, a problem that a brief affair with Doug does nothing to solve, and only makes matters worse when her husband finds out and kicks her out of the house. Celia turns to Sullivan Groff, and in exchange for a house she delivers him a plebiscite merging the two towns and thereby allowing the sewer system to be built.

Doug manages to be re-instated on the council only to find the town merged with Majestic as a result of Celia's maneuverings and Nancy's hard work collecting names. He vows to get back at Groff, first causing a sewage geyser during the televised opening of the new system, and then stealing the mega-church's 18 foot tall illuminated cross.

Conrad and Heylia start a new growing operation, initially at the behest of U-Turn. After U-Turn's demise, Nancy secures new funding for the operation through an investor, Doug. They disguise the operation as a company that makes fountains that look like little houses. But when Celia investigates "Aguatecture," she uses her information in the attempt to blackmail Nancy. Ultimately, Celia cashes in and winds up renting out the home Groff gave her as a growing house for Nancy, Conrad and Heylia when their harvest is threatened by a building inspection. Doug eventually installs the cross in the house, which leads to its discovery by the DEA on thermal maps.

===Season 4===

==Pre-air episode leaks==

The first episode of the third season was scheduled to air on [[August 13]], [[2007]]. On [[July 22]], [[2007]], the first and second episodes of season 3 were leaked on the internet. On [[July 24]], [[2007]], the third episode was leaked, and on [[July 27]], [[2007]], the fourth episode was leaked. The fourth episode was not a complete version; among other things, some dubbed lines were not complete (notably a voicemail message Nancy receives from U-Turn is spoken by a distinctly different actor, and in place of the end credits a card is inserted reading "End Titles"). As of December 2007, all 15 episodes of the third season were available online. Due to the high quality of the leaked episodes, some have speculated that the episodes were leaked intentionally in order to garner interest in the show and to create an internet buzz. Weeds creator [[Jenji Kohan]] has showed a positive interest in the ''Weeds'' episodes leaking online, saying, "Revenue aside, I don't expect to get rich on ''Weeds'', I'm excited it's out there. Showtime is great, but it does have a limited audience."<ref>http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/08/07/weeds-creator-loves-illegal-downloads-of-show/</ref> In 2006 before season 2 aired on Showtime, the first fjjkhew episodes were also leaked online.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/massive-leak-of-pre-air-tv-shows-piracy-or-promotion/|publisher=TorrentFreak|title= Massive Leak of Pre-Air TV Shows: Piracy or Promotion?|date=2007-07-24|accessdate=2007-07-24}}</ref>

<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Agrestic.jpg|thumb|right|A screenshot of Agrestic during the opening credits.]] -->
* In season one, the title song "[[Little Boxes]]" is performed by its writer, [[Malvina Reynolds]]. 
* In seasons two and three, the title song is performed by a different artist for each episode with the exception of the season finales, which again use Reynolds' version.
* The season three finale also used [[Pete Seeger]]'s cover of the song over the closing credits.
