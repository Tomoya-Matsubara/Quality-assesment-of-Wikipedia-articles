'''Geoffrey Henry Cecil Bing''' (24 July 1909 &ndash; 24 April 1977) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] barrister and politician who served as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[British House of Commons|Member of Parliament]] for [[Hornchurch (UK Parliament constituency)|Hornchurch]] from 1945 to 1955.

Born at Craigavad near [[Belfast]], Bing was educated at [[Tonbridge School]] before going on to [[Lincoln College, Oxford]], where he read history. He was [[called to the Bar]] from the [[Inner Temple]] in 1934.<ref>''Law Lists'' 1935-1977</ref>

Always a [[Far left|radical]] and a member of the [[socialism|socialist left]], Bing was active in the Haldane Society and the [[National Council for Civil Liberties]]. During the [[Spanish Civil War]], he joined the [[International Brigades]] as a journalist, barely avoiding capture at [[Bilbao]]. He was also an early anti-Nazi.

During [[World War II]], he served in the [[Royal Corps of Signals|Royal Signals]], attaining the rank of [[major]]. A 1943 experiment with parachutes at the GSO2 Airborne Forces Development Centre left him disfigured and he bore the scars for many years.

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]], Bing stood for Labour in Hornchurch, winning the seat. He was re-elected in [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|1951]], serving until 1955. He served briefly as a junior [[Whip (politics)|whip]] in 1945-6 but this was widely thought to have been the unintended result of confusion on [[Clement Attlee]]'s part, who confused him for another Labour MP of a similar name.

==Backbencher==
On the [[backbencher|backbenches]], Bing was, according to his ''Times'' obituary:
:''the unrestrained leader of a small group of radicals, never fully trusted by their colleagues and known as "Bing Boys".''
He took a particular interest in the cases of [[Timothy Evans]] and [[John Christie]], and he supported the campaign to overturn the conviction of Evans, which was ultimately successful. 
He supported Communist China and took a keen interest in [[Northern Ireland]], the brewers' monopoly and parliamentary procedure.

He was also a lawyer, building up a practice in West Africa. He became close to [[Kwame Nkrumah]], the first post-colonial president of [[Ghana]] and was appointed Ghana's attorney-general, a post he held until 1961. When Nkrumah was ousted in 1966, Bing was arrested and ill-treated, before being sent home some months later. His memoir of Nkrumah's Ghana, ''Reap the Whirlwind'', was published in 1968.
