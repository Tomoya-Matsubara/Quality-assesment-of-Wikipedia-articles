'''Deckham''' is a residential suburb in the [[Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead]] in [[Tyne and Wear]], England. It is bordered by [[Gateshead]] to the north, [[Sheriff Hill]] to the south, [[Felling, Tyne and Wear|Felling]] and [[Carr Hill]] to the east and Shipcote to the west. It lies on the [[List of B roads in Great Britain|B1296]], the route of the old [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]], {{convert|1|mi}} south of [[Gateshead]], {{convert|1.5|mi}} south of [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] and {{convert|13|mi}} north of the [[Durham, England|city of Durham]]. In 2012, Deckham had a population of 9,228.

Deckham's history is sparsely documented but suggests that the settlement was established at the junction of Carr Hill Road and the Old Durham Road in the early 19th century alongside the estate of Deckham Hall, built several centuries earlier and inhabited at one time by Thomas Deckham. The village grew, and at the turn of the 20th century was enveloped by [[urban spawl]] when neighbouring Gateshead absorbed its outlying villages and settlements. Deckham is largely distinguished from other areas by a commercial area on Old Durham Road which is the principal route through the suburb. [[Historic counties of England|Historically]], Deckham was a village in [[County Durham]] and was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead by the [[Local Government Act 1972]].

Deckham has steep [[topography]] which has shaped the character of the suburb. Residents can enjoy striking views towards Newcastle upon Tyne and across the [[Team Valley]]. The settlement is governed locally by a [[Labour Party (UK)|Parliamentary Labour council]] and elects a Labour MP.

Deckham is an area of [[Social deprivation|social]] and economic deprivation, in the top ten per cent of such areas according to the [[Index of Multiple Deprivation]]. Housing stock is predominantly [[council housing]] and is, in many places, outdated and in need of modernisation. Whilst once the site of a coal mine, there is today no major employer in Deckham, which is considered a [[residential suburb]] of Gateshead. The main economic activity is in a commercial development on Old Durham Road. Deckham has a number of public houses, one of which, the Plough Inn, is more than 150 years old. The only education provision is at South Street [[Primary School]], which is a good school according to [[OFSTED]]. There are two churches, one of which, the Church of St George, is a [[Grade II listed building]], and community facilities are provided by Deckham Community Centre and the Elgin Centre in Carr Hill.

[[File:Ordnance Survey Map of the Deckham Settlement (1895).gif|thumb|An 1895 [[Ordnance Survey]] Map of the early Deckham settlement (marked in red) on which Deckhall Hall and the two public houses are clearly evidenced]]

Unlike Sheriff Hill, Carr Hill and [[Low Fell]], Deckham's history is sparsely recorded. It indicates that, by the middle of the 19th century, there was a small settlement<ref name="Manders, 1973: 312">Manders, 1973: 312</ref> which was part of [[Gateshead Fell]]; a wild and treacherous area of common land<ref>Manders, 1973: 308</ref> notable for the criminality of the [[tinkers]] and [[Hawker (trade)|hawkers]] who lived there.<ref>Manders, 1973: 309. Indeed, in March 1888, ''North Country Lore and Legend, Monthly Chronicle'' recalled: "Gateshead Fell, as the name implies, was once a wild common, over a portion of which lay the road between Durham and Newcastle. The loneliness of the bleak moorland was quite guile enough to invest it with terror to travellers a hundred years ago and occasionally there were incidents that served greatly to enhance the evil repute of the locality&nbsp;..." (author unknown)</ref> [[Ordnance survey]] mapping illustrates the sparsity of buildings in 1860; the area contained little except Deckham Hall, a few other dwellings and two public houses<ref name="here">"England - Durham: 007", Ordnance Survey 1:10,560 - Epoch 1 (1862).

The route of the B1296 Old Durham Road is exactly the same as the old turnpike road which ran through Gateshead Fell and which linked Durham to Newcastle-upon-Tyne (see Manders, 1973: 308)</ref> branched off towards Carr's Hill.<ref name="Manders, 1973: 312"/> The two public houses were the 'Speed the Plough'<ref>Manders, 1973: 312<U+2013>3</ref> and 'The Ship'.<ref name="here"/>

The Deckham Hall estate was on the east side of Old Durham Road, 1.25 miles from the [[Tyne Bridge]].<ref name="Carlton, 1974: 26">Carlton, 1974: 26</ref><ref name="MacKenzie and Ross, 1834: 106">MacKenzie and Ross, 1834: 106</ref> It is evidenced in 1614 and belonged to Thomas Deckham,<ref>MacKenzie, 1827, 760</ref> who died the same year and [[Bequest|bequeathed]] it to his grand-daughter<ref>Walton, 1962 at para.3</ref> with "three pounds for the bringing home of water" to the poor people of the area.<ref name="MacKenzie and Ross, 1834: 106"/> It changed hands regularly between the families Wooler, James and Bowker,<ref name="MacKenzie and Ross, 1834: 106"/> in the centuries after Deckham's death and varied in size whilst doing so.<ref name="Carlton, 1974: 26"/> Alderman Benjamin Biggar, Mayor of Gateshead 1861<U+2013>2, is thought to have lived at Deckham Hall.<ref>Walton, 1962 at para.18</ref>

[[File:Northborne street, Deckham..JPG|left|thumb|The 19th-century [[Tyneside flat]]s in Northborne Street]]
By the turn of the 20th century Deckham's rural aspect had changed. Whilst there remained large areas of grass and woodland between Deckham and Gateshead, there was a period of extensive building; several dozen dwellings were erected by 1895 in the Mount Pleasant area as Gateshead expanded southwards.<ref>'Newcastle Upon Tyne - Durham: 007/01', Ordnance Survey 1:2,500 - Epoch 1 (1895) An online version may be available [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/mapsheet.aspx?compid=55209&sheetid=10250&ox=650&oy=1223&zm=2&czm=2&x=289&y=248 here]</ref> A public house was built at the junction of Taylor Terrace and Split Crow Road.<ref>'Newcastle Upon Tyne - Durham: 007/01', Ordnance Survey 1:2,500 - Epoch 1 (1895) An online version may be available [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/mapsheet.aspx?compid=55209&sheetid=10250&ox=650&oy=1223&zm=2&czm=2&x=289&y=248 here] probably 'The Deckham Inn'.</ref> Two years later, a tract of [[Tyneside flat]]s was built on the west side of the Old Durham Road and many streets in the area, such as Chandos Street, Shipcote Terrace, Raby Street and Northborne Street, are evidenced, along with an unnamed school.<ref>County Series, Durham VII 5, 1987, scale 1: 2,500</ref> By 1919, some rural scenes could still be enjoyed<ref name="Manders, 1973: 314">Manders, 1973: 314</ref> but the fields were "rapidly encroached upon" in the 1920s and 1930s<ref name="Manders, 1973: 314"/> and replaced with more terraced housing at Caris Street, Fullerton Place and Methuen Street and large tracts of [[Council housing|council houses]].<ref>NLP, 2006: 3 at para 1.8</ref> By this time, Deckham Hall was in a state of disrepair and was notable to residents for its resemblance to a haunted house "because of its air of gloom and the strange echoes to be heard on windy nights".<ref>Walton, 1962 at para.25</ref> The hall was demolished in 1930<ref>Carlton, 1974: 27</ref> and more council houses were erected on the site.<ref>Walton, 1962 at para.26</ref>

[[File:Hendon Road, Deckham.JPG|thumb|Hendon Road]]Since the intensive period of house building, little has changed. At the west end of the suburb, the Tyneside flats at Northborne Street and surrounding streets remain ''in situ'' and here there is "housing and little else".<ref>GC07<U+2013> Deckham West: 1</ref> Much of this housing is in poor condition, some is in "crumbling disrepair" and requires substantial investment.<ref>NLP, 2006: 6 at para. 1.19</ref><ref>UHC, 2006: 31 at para 8.3</ref><ref>NLP, 2006: 13 at para.1.53</ref> Old Durham Road has developed into the focal point of the neighbourhood<ref>UHC, 2006: 31 at para 8.7</ref> and is the sole commercial area, with small, independent shops running along the western end of the road backing onto the streets from Inskip Terrace and Shipcote Terrace.<ref>UHC, 2006: 13 at para 2.11</ref> Whilst many retail units are in a state of deterioration,<ref>UHC, 2006: 17 at para 4.7</ref> and despite a report describing recent housing development on the east side of Old Durham Road as "poorly handled and unsightly",<ref>UHC, 2006: 25 at para 6.15</ref> the area remains "interesting and lively".<ref name="GC09<U+2013> East Deckham: 1">GC09<U+2013> East Deckham: 1</ref> By contrast, the central and eastern areas of Deckham are affected by a more marked decline. At the western edge there are stone remnants of an old, rural settlement,<ref name="GC09<U+2013> East Deckham: 1"/> but the remainder, grouped around Edgeware and Kingston Roads, consists of bland, repetitive social housing arranged on long, curved streets which combine to create an environment which is anonymous, claustrophobic and disorientating.<ref name="GC09<U+2013> East Deckham: 1"/> One source describes the environment as one where "eyesores become landmarks (lock<U+2013>up workshops on Kingston Road), any slight change in materials becomes significant (system<U+2013>built housing on Kingston Road), and any attempt to do something different becomes a relief (a corner garden on Mayfair Gardens)".<ref name="GC09<U+2013> East Deckham: 1"/>

The net result is that, in Deckham today:
<blockquote>There is something of a sense of isolation in parts of Deckham, especially further up the hill as development densities drop, commercial and social facilities disappear and activity levels on the street fall away. Around the Old Durham Road the surviving mix of small shops and meeting places generate some impression of communal spirit, but the poor condition of
many properties and the dominance of the public realm by traffic serve to stunt it.<ref>UHC, 2006: 15 at para.3.12</ref></blockquote>

==Economy==

[[File:Old Durham Road looking south.JPG|thumb|right|The shopping area on Old Durham Road is the economic hub of the area.]]Unlike Sheriff Hill, Deckham was not founded on [[heavy industry]]. It developed primarily for its ease of access to the [[turnpike road]], the principle route between Durham and Newcastle-upon-Tyne which ran through it.<ref>Manders, 1973: 307</ref> There is evidence of coal mining; the Durham Mining Museum has a record for 'Deckham Hall Colliery'.<ref name="dmm.org.uk">Author unknown, [http://www.dmm.org.uk/colliery/d022.htm ''Deckham Hall Colliery'', Durham Mining Museum] (retrieved 19 June 2012).</ref> Few records of the colliery survive, and it is difficult to ascertain when it opened, but the colliery was located 1.5 miles south from Newcastle<ref name="dmm.org.uk"/> and was in the hands of Hopper, Hughes and Company in 1886.<ref>Walton, 1962</ref> By December 1893 the colliery had been abandoned as being "not workable to a profit".<ref>Author unknown, [http://www.dmm.org.uk/abandon/d022.htm ''Catalogue of Plans of Abandoned Mines for Deckham Hall Colliery'', Durham Mining Museum] (retrieved 19 June 2012).</ref>

In common with most suburbs of the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, its economy is dominated by the economies of Newcastle<U+2013>upon<U+2013>Tyne and Gateshead town centre.<ref>NPSD, 2006: 36 at para 4.4</ref> This is reflected in terms of independent commercial space; retail floor space in the suburb totals 1% of that available in the whole metropolitan borough.<ref>NPSD, 2006: 37 at para. 4.10</ref> There are 33 retail units concentrated on Old Durham Road, which provide some employment, though these are at the lower end of the spectrum and provide little choice.<ref>NPSD, 2006: 41 at para.4.38</ref> There is a good provision of hardware stores, fast<U+2013>food outlets and hairdressers, a butcher's shop, a greengrocer and a supermarket, but there is no bakery, bank nor building society and the Post Office has closed.<ref>NPSD, 2006: 41<U+2013>42: at paras. 4.39 & ndash; 4.41</ref> The retail units were domestic properties, so many are too small for retail purposes and around 20% are vacant.<ref>NPSD, 2006: 42 at para.4.42</ref>

Deckham suffers from high levels of unemployment; in 2011 the mean percentage of the population claiming [[Jobseekers Allowance]] was 7%. This compares to Gateshead's 5% average over the same period.<ref>Deckham<U+2013>Ward Factsheet, 2012: 1 (retrieved 19 June 2012)</ref> [[Youth unemployment in the United Kingdom|Youth unemployment]] is 10%, compared to Gateshead's 9%.<ref>Deckham<U+2013>Ward Factsheet, 2012: 2 (retrieved 19 June 2012)</ref>

==Geography and topography==

[[File:Old Durham Road, Deckham.JPG|thumb|right|From the southern end of Old Durham Road, the steep slope north towards central Gateshead is apparent and the cityscape of Newcastle upon Tyne is clearly visible.]]
Deckham, at latitude 54.95<U+00B0> N and longitude 1.59 <U+00B0> W, lies less than {{convert|1|mi}} south and east of Gateshead town centre between two main transport corridors; [[A184 road (England)#Triple-digit roads|Sunderland Road]] to the east and Old Durham Road to the west.<ref name="NLP, 2006: 1">NLP, 2006: 1</ref> The distance from Deckham to London is {{convert|255|mi}}. Deckham occupies an elevated position, especially at its north end which sits on a ridge,<ref>GVA, 2006: 7 at para 4.3</ref> and some parts are steeply sloped<U+2013> notably those which border Sheriff Hill to the south.<ref name="NLP, 2006: 1"/>

In the urban expansion of Gateshead, Deckham was enveloped so that its exact boundaries are difficult to define.<ref name="Carlton, 1974: 26"/> The estate had boundaries at Split Crow Road, Old Durham Road, Hendon Road and Carr Hill Road<ref name="Carlton, 1974: 26"/> but documents indicate that Deckham stretches to Durham Road in the west and the streets adjoining Hendon Road as far north as the Bankies [[Urban open space|open space]] at Mount Pleasant.<ref>GVA Grimley, [http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/DocumentLibrary/Building/Leaflets/neighbourhoodplans/deckham_nplan.pdf Deckham Neighbourhood- Preferred Plan], Gateshead Council, December 2005 (retrieved 17 June 2012)</ref> In&nbsp;1974 Deckham was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead by the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. Until its implementation, Deckham was part of County Durham.<ref>Manders, 1973, 306</ref> It is now bordered by settlements which are part of the metropolitan borough. These are Sheriff Hill to the south, Low Fell and Shipcote to the west, Gateshead to the north and Felling and Carr Hill to the east.<ref>GVA, 2006: 20</ref>

Deckham has distinctive, steep topography which "shapes the character" of the suburb.<ref>GVA, 2006: 7 at 4.3</ref> Though the urbanisation of Gateshead has detracted from panoramic views that were once enjoyed by residents, the topography ensures that residents continue to have excellent views towards Newcastle-upon-Tyne and the Team Valley.<ref>NLP, 2006: 1 at 1.1</ref>
