'''Longyearbyen''' is the largest settlement and the [[administrative center]] of [[Svalbard]], [[Norway]].  As of 2008, the town had a population of 2,040. Longyearbyen is located in the valley of [[Adventdalen]], at the end of [[Adventfjorden]], a bay of [[Isfjorden (Svalbard)|Isfjorden]] located on the west coast of [[Spitsbergen]]. Since 2002, [[Longyearbyen Community Council]] has had many of the same responsibilities of a [[municipalities of Norway|municipality]], including utilities, education, cultural facilities, fire department, roads and ports. It governs an area of {{convert|242.86|km2|abbr=on}}. The town is also the seat of the [[Governor of Svalbard]] and is the world's [[northernmost settlements|northernmost settlement]] which is not a research or meteorological station.

Known as '''Longyear City''' until 1926, the town was established by and named for [[John Munroe Longyear]], whose [[Arctic Coal Company]] started [[coal mining]] operations in 1906. These were taken over by [[Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani]] (SNSK) in 1916, which still conducts mining. The town was burned by the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' on 8 August 1943, but rebuilt after the [[Second World War]]. Traditionally, Longyearbyen was a [[company town]], but from the 1990s, most mining operations moved to [[Sveagruva]] and the company has seen an large increase in tourism and research. This has seen the arrival of institutions such as the [[University Centre in Svalbard]], the [[Svalbard Global Seed Vault]] and [[Svalbard Satellite Station]]. The community is served by [[Svalbard Airport, Longyear]] and [[Svalbard Church]].

==History==
[[File:Longyear City 1908.jpg|thumb|left|Longyear City in 1908]]

In 1896, [[Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab]] started operating tours to [[Hotellneset]]. To accommodate tourists, they built a prefabricated hotel, but it was not profitable and was closed after the 1897 season. Two families overwintered there in 1898<U+2013>99.<ref>Holm (1999): 55</ref> [[Norway Post]] operted a post office at Hotellneset from 1897 to 1899.<ref name=h104>Holm (1999): 104</ref> The first commercially viable coal on Svalbard was harvested by S<U+00F8>ren Zakariassen in 1899.<ref>Holm (1999): 45</ref> In 1901, Bergen-Spitsbergen Kullgrube-kompani started mining coal in [[Adventtoppen]]. During their first summer season, they mined {{convert|5|t}}. They lived on board their ship and freighted the coal with a row-boat. In 1903, they produced {{convert|40|t}}.<ref name=h46>Holm (1999): 46</ref>

The American industrialist John Munro Longyear visited Spistbergen as a tourist in 1901, where he met with an expedition prospecting for coal. He returned to Spitsbergen 1903, where he met Henrik B. N<U+00E6>ss in Adventsfjorden, who gave him information on coal fields and samples. Along with his associate [[Frederick Ayer]], he bought the Norwegian claims on the west side of Adventfjord, and expanded the claims significantly the following year. In 1906, the [[Boston]]-based Arctic Coal Company, with Ayer and Longyear as the main shareholders, started mining in Mine 1a after having built docks and the first housing.<ref name=geodef>{{cite web |url=http://miljo.npolar.no/placenames/pages/detailn.asp?placeNameID=08560A |title=Longyearbyen |publisher=[[Norwegian Polar Institute]] |accessdate=15 March 2012 |archivedate=15 March 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66BrKbhNE |deadurl=no}}</ref> The company had American administration, but mostly Norwegian laborers. The company named the town Longyear City.<ref name=h46 /> Coal was transported the {{convert|1.2|km|sp=us}} from the mine to the port using an [[aerial tramway]].<ref name=h148>Holm (1999): 148</ref> In 1913, the company started preliminary work to open Mine 2a.<ref name=h47>Holm (1999): 47</ref>

[[File:Longyearbyen-mine(js) 14.jpg|thumb|left|Mine 2b was mined from 1938 to 1969 and it today a heritage site.]]
Following financial difficulties during the [[First World War]],<ref name=h46 /> the mining operations were bought by Store Norske, which was incorporated in Oslo on 30 November 1916.<ref name=h119>Holm (1999): 119</ref> That year, SNSK built five new barracks, including one that was made into a hospital.<ref>Holm (1999): 83</ref> SNSK introduced its own money with approval from [[Norges Bank]], consisting entirely of [[banknote]]s at par with [[Norwegian krone]].<ref name=h116>Holm (1999): 116</ref> The American community buried their dead at Hotellneset. In 1918, eleven people were killed by the [[Spanish flu]] and a graveyard was established in Longyear City.<ref>Holm (1999): 64</ref> In 1920, 26 men were killed in a [[coal dust]] explosion in in Mine 1. This resulted in the mine being closed<ref name=h46 /> and electric operation being taken into use in Mine 2.<ref name=h47 /> The same year, the first truck was delivered to the town for use in the mining operations.<ref name=h69>Holm (1999): 69</ref>

The [[Church of Norway]] appointed Thorleif <U+00D8>stenstad av Svalbard's first vicar and teacher in 1920.<ref name=h126>Holm (1999): 126</ref> He started teaching eight school children, with the school organized in cooperation with SNSK.<ref name=h114>Holm (1999): 114</ref> The first Svalbard Church opened on 28 August 1921,<ref name=h126 /> and the churches reading room was from then used as a school.<ref name=h114 /> Longyear City was renamed Longyearbyen in 1926.<ref>Holm (1999): 85</ref>

The [[Norwegian Telecommunications Administration]] established a [[coast radio station]] at [[Finneset]] ([[Svalbard Radio]]) in 1911. In 1930, the radio station was moved to Longyearbyen.<ref name=h149>Holm (1999): 149</ref> SS ''Lyngen'' started calling regularly during the summer season from 1935 at Longyearbyen, starting the town's tourism industry.<ref name=h153>Holm (1999): 153</ref> In 1937, SNSK established Sverdrupbyen to house workers for Mine 1b and operation of the mine started in 1939.<ref name=h143>Holm (1999): 143</ref> In 1938, Longyearbyen's first road was completed, between the town center and Sverdrupbyen.<ref name=h166>Holm (1999): 166</ref> Operations at Mine 2b, a different entrance to Mine 2a, started in 1939.<ref name=h47 />

Svalbard remained unaffected by the [[German occupation of Norway]] in 1940. However, the achipelago became of strategic important in the supply chain between the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] from 1941, in addition to the supply of badly-needed coal. The [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|Norwegian government-in-exile]] rejected a Soviet<U+2013>British occupation;<ref>Arlov (1994): 74</ref> instead The British Army started [[Operation Gauntlet]] to [[emergency evacuation|evacuate]] Spitsbergen. On 29 August 1941, the entire population of Ny-<U+00C5>lesund was evacuated to Longyearbyen and on 3 September, 765 people were evacuated from Longyearbyen to Scotland. Later the last 150 men were also evacuated.<ref>Holm (1999): 73</ref> With Longyearbyen depopulated, it a small German garrison and air strip was established, mostly to provide meteorological data. After the British [[Operation Fritham]] regained control of [[Barentsburg]], the German forces left Longyearbyen without combat.<ref name=a75>Arlov (1994): 75</ref>

In September 1943, the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' dispatched two battleships, [[German battleship Tirpitz|Tirpitz]] and [[German battleship Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]], and nine destroyers to set afire Longyearbyen, Barentsburg and [[Grumant]].<ref name=a75 /> Only four buildings in Longyearben survived: the hospital, the power station, an office building and a residential building, in addition to Sverdrupbyen. Longyearbyen remained unsettled until the end of the war, with the first ship from the mainland leaving on 27 June 1945.<ref>Holm (1999): 74</ref>

Plans for reconstruction were laid during the war, allowing a quick reconstruction of Longyearbyen and the stating of mining operations. By 1948, coal production reached the pre-war level of {{convert|480000|t}}.<ref>Arlov (1994): 79</ref> [[Nybyen]] was established in 1946 and consisted of five barracks, each with place 72 people.<ref>Holm (1999): 94</ref> The first issue of ''[[Svalbardposten]]'' was published in November 1948.

Longyearbyen, the largest settlement in Svalbard, is located in the lower portion of the valley of [[Longyeardalen]], along the river of [[Longyearelva]].

Longyearbyen is divided into several neighborhoods. On the west side of the river, along the bay, lays the port and affiliated utility and industrial services. Furthest west this area is called Bykaia and further in Sj<U+00F8>omr<U+00E5>det. Above lays Skj<U+00E6>ringa, which contains the Governor's offices. Slightly up the valley on the west side lays Gamle Longyearbyen ("Old Longyearbyen") and the church. Even further up lays the gravel yard, then Huset and the cinema, and finally Sverdrupbyen. Most of the residential, commerical and cultural institutions are located on th east side of the river. Along the bay the area is called Sj<U+00F8>skrenten. Further up lays the university center and Gruvedalen, the largest residential area. Southwards from there is the main shopping area as well as most public offices and cultural institutions. To the east is the residential area Lia and further up Haugen, which is also the the location of the school. Furthest up in the valley is Mine 2b and [[Nybyen]], which is mostly used as student housing. Westwards out of town towards Hotellneset is the airport and Mine 3. The remaining mines are located in Adventdalen, to the east of town.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unis.no/10_STUDIES/1040_Student_Life/documents/Longyearbyen_map.pdf |title=Longyearbyen map |publisher=Svalbard Reiseliv |accessdate=19 March 2012 |archivedate=19 March 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66I5eu2UK |deadurl=no}}</ref>

Longyearbyen has an over-average share of its population between 25 and 44 years old, but nearly no residents over 66. The number of children in relation to the population is average, but Longyearbyen has significantly fewer teenagers than the national average.<ref name=demographics />

Longyearbyen experiences a very high [[population turnover|turnover]]; in 2008, 427 people (23 percent) moved away from the town.<ref name=pop /> The average person lived in Longyearbyen for 6.3 years, although it is 6.6 years for Norwegians and 4.3 years for foreigners. In 2009, about a quarter of the population had lived in the town from before 2000, and could thus be regarded as permanent population. The longest residing people tend to work in the mining industry, followed by local government employees. The shortest tenures are held by students and employees in higher education, tourism and the state.<ref name=demographics />

Seventy percent of households have a single person, compared to forty-one percent on the mainland, giving an average 1.6 people per household. However, the difference is largely caused by individuals working on Svalbard while their family remains on the mainland. Longyearbyen's population is higher educated than the national average: 54 compared to 43 percent have upper secondary education and 30 compared to 26 percent have tertiary education. Among women, 40 percent have higher education.<ref name=demographics />

The [[Svalbard Treaty]] of 1920 established full Norwegian [[sovereignty]] over the archipelago.

Longyearbyen is a the center point of tourism on the archipelago, although most tourism is generated based on nature rather than visiting the community itself. However, Longyearbyen does provide both supplies, accomodation and several museums. In 2008, Longyearbyen experienced 89,000 guest-nights, up from 30,000 in 1995. The average guest stayed 2.2 nights and 60 percent of the capacity was used by tourists. About 40,000 tourists flew in to Longyearbyen. Two-thirds of the tourists come from Norway.
