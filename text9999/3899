The '''1940 Stanford Indians football team''', nicknamed the "Wow Boys", represented [[Stanford University]] in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[college football|intercollegiate competition]] during the [[1940 college football season|1940 season]]. First-year head coach [[Clark Shaughnessy]] inherited a team that finished with a 1<U+2013>7<U+2013>1 record the previous season.<ref name=magazine>[http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2007/janfeb/red/wowboys.html Wow Boys: The Team That Changed the Game], ''Stanford Magazine'', Stanford Alumni Association, January/February 2007.</ref> He installed his own version of the [[T formation]], a system that had largely fallen into disuse since the 1890s and was viewed as obsolete. The Indians shocked observers when they won all ten of their games including the [[1941 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]], which prompted several selectors to declare them the 1940 national champions. Stanford's dramatic reversal of fortunes prompted football programs across the nation to abandon the single-wing formation in favor of the new T formation.

==Preseason==
[[Clark Shaughnessy]] had served as the head coach at the [[University of Chicago]] since 1930. While there, he developed a new version of the [[T formation]] based upon the "pro T" that was concurrently in use by the [[Chicago Bears]] of the [[National Football League]].<ref name=hof>[http://www.collegefootball.org/famersearch.php?id=40060 Member Biography: Clark Shaughnessy], College Football Hall of Fame, National Football Foundation, retrieved July 28, 2009.</ref> The T formation, in which three [[back (American football)|backs]] lined up abreast and behind the [[quarterback]] who was himself behind the [[center (American football)|center]], was an obsolescent system that had been disused since the 1890s in favor of the [[single-wing formation|single-wing]] and [[double-wing formation]]s.<ref name=si>[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1092785/index.htm A Melding Of Men All Suited To A T: Clark Shaughnessy was a dour theoretician, Frankie Albert an unrestrained quarterback and Stanford a team of losers, but combined they forever changed the game of football], ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', September 5, 1977.</ref> Shaugnessy, however, incorporated several new features in his own version of the T.

Stanford center [[Milt Vucinich]] said, "We'd been reading about all those beatings Shaughnessy's men had taken, so we were joking among ourselves that wasn't it just like Stanford to hire somebody like this to coach us."<ref name=wow>James W. Johnson, [http://books.google.com/books?id=f8lyBNwMOnIC The Wow Boys: a Coach, a Team, and a Turning Point in College Football], pp. xvii-xix, University of Nebraska Press, 2006, ISBN 080327632X.</ref> In his first address to the team, Shaughnessy told them, "Boys, I am not to be addressed as 'Clark' or, especially, [the nickname of] 'Soup'. To you, I am 'Mr. Shaughnessy' or 'Coach.' Nothing else. I am a professor of football&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now, I have a formation for you that if you learn it well will take you to the [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]]."<ref name=wow/> He asserted that one of his plays, a [[rush (American football)|line plunge]] by a back without a [[block (American football)|blocker]], would score ten to twelve touchdowns alone, which was more than the Indians had scored the entire previous season. The players were understandably skeptical,<ref name=wow/> and they were not alone. Football innovator and single-wing proponent [[Glenn Scobey Warner|Glenn "Pop" Warner]] said before the season, "If Stanford wins a single game with that crazy formation, you can throw all the football I ever knew into the Pacific Ocean."<ref name=hof/> Shaughnessy later discovered that the players, who were mostly returners from the 1939 team, were talented, but not suited to the single wing.<ref name=wow/> As a contemporary newspaper noted, "The [1939] team looked great in some games and sour in others. The machinery was there but it wasn't running as smoothly as had been hoped for."<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o6YLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rFQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4956,3637113 Stanford Looks For Big Things In New Regime], ''[[The Evening Independent]]'', p. 13, September 11, 1940.</ref>

Stanford opened the season with a road game against {{cfb link|year=1940|team=San Francisco Dons|title=San Francisco U}}, which the Indians defeated convincingly, 27<U+2013>0.<ref name=results>[http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/pac10/stanford/yearly_results.php?year=1940 Stanford Yearly Results: 1940<U+2013>1942], College Football Data Warehouse, retrieved July 28, 2009.</ref> Their next opponents' head coach, [[Tex Oliver]] of {{cfb link|year=1940|team=Oregon Ducks|title=Oregon}}, was in attendance and said, "[H]alf of the time neither we or the spectators knew who was the ballcarrier until someone would dart out from the sidelines with the pigskin under his arms... and it was probably [quarterback [[Frankie Albert|Frank<nowiki>]</nowiki> Albert]]..<ref name=tex/> Oliver added, "If we expect to stop their attack, we'll have to work fast", and immediately returned home to conduct intense practices in preparation for Stanford.<ref name=tex>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7IoRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=X-gDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6590,4315018 Tex Oliver Rates Stanford on Par With 1939 U.S.C.

Nebraska received the opening [[kickoff]] and halfback {{alternate links|Butch Luther|Walter Luther|title=Butch Luther|alt=Butch Luther}} [[kick return|returned]] it 27 yards to the Stanford 48-yard line. The drive culminated in a short rush by fullback Ike Francis, and with the extra point, the Cornhuskers took a 7-0 lead on the first possession. Stanford drove into Nebraska territory, but fumbled the ball away on the 28-yard line. The Cornhuskers punted it away and the Indians mounted a touchdown drive to equalize the score. In the second quarter, Nebraska recovered a fumbled punt return and on the subsequent possession scored on a 33-yard pass. Stanford responded immediately, and Albert passed to [[Hugh Gallarneau]] for a 40-yard touchdown to tie the game at 13. Albert made the extra point kick to take the lead. In the third quarter, the Indians drove 76 yards to within inches of the opposing goal line, but the Cornhusker defense held and took over on downs. Nebraska punted the ball away and Kmetovic returned it 40 yards for a touchdown. Albert made the extra point and Stanford went on to win the game, 21-13.<ref name=recap>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=br0KAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jU0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3625,228431 Stanford Trims Nebraska, 21-13], ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'', January 1, 1941.</ref>

After the season, three [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|NCAA-recognized selectors]] named Stanford the national championship team. At the time, the Poling System bestowed that title upon the Indians. In later years, the Billingsley Report and the [[Helms Athletic Foundation]] retroactively declared Stanford the 1940 champions.<ref name=ncaa/> [[Frank Albert]] was named a consensus [[1940 College Football All-America Team|All-American]] at quarterback and finished fourth in the [[Heisman Trophy]] voting.

==Lasting impact==
An earlier doubter, Pop Warner acknowledged the unexpected success of the revived formation during Stanford's meteoric 1940 season. He said, "Shaughnessy has taken that T formation we used when I played at [[Cornell Big Red football|Cornell]] in {{alternate links|1892 college football season|title=1892|alt=1892}} and made it work as it has never worked before. This is because he has added his own ideas. There is no mystery about Shaughnessy's success at Stanford as I see it. The only mystery is where the ball is on some of those tricky plays of his."<ref name=glory/>

The 1940 Stanford Indians, who became known as the "Wow Boys",<ref name=si/> proved the value of the T formation, and in response, football coaches around the nation eagerly adopted it for their own teams. [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] coach [[Frank Leahy]] caused a stir in 1942 when he scrapped the venerable [[Notre Dame box|box formation]] in favor of the T. A survey conducted by ''[[Football Digest]]'' at the end of the decade revealed that 250 of the 350 best football teams were utilizing the formation. Shaughnessy's T gave rise to various incarnations, including the [[pro set]], [[I formation#Variations|power I]], [[veer]], and the [[wishbone formation]].<ref name=si/> Clark Shaughnessy was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1968.<ref name=hof/> Today, his variant of the T formation remains in use, with some modifications, and according to ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', it "remains the longest-running formation in the history of the game".<ref name=bears/>
