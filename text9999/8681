The '''Shabakunk Creek''' is a [[tributary]] of the [[Assunpink Creek]] in western [[New Jersey]] in the [[United States]].<ref name=NHD>U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. [http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/ The National Map], accessed May 26, 2013</ref> Via the Assunpink, its water ultimately flows into the [[Delaware River]]. The name Shabakunk is from the [[Unami language|Lenape]] word meaning "shore land".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawrencenaturecenter.net/history.html|title=The Lawrence Nature Center|accessdate=May 27, 2013}}</ref>

==Course==

===Main branch===
The {{convert|7.9|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} main branch of the Shabakunk Creek is born near what was once known as [[Twin Pine Airport]] in [[Hopewell Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Hopewell Township]]. Flowing southwards, it flows under [[County Route 546 (New Jersey)|Pennington-Lawrenceville Road]] and then passes underneath [[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]], joining with several unnamed tributaries in the process. From this point, it continues southward into [[Ewing Township, New Jersey|Ewing]], crosses underneath Bull Run Road and [[List of county routes in Mercer County, New Jersey#636|Ewingville Road]], and enters the 11-acre [[Lake Sylva]] on the campus of [[The College of New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvrpc.org/reports/05008.pdf|title=Environmental Resource Inventory for the Township of Ewing, Mercer County, New Jersey|accessdate=May 27, 2013}}</ref>

Below Lake Sylva, the Shabakunk flows southeastward, passing under Green Lane and then Ewingville Road for a second time.  For a short distance it forms the border of Ewing and [[Lawrence Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Lawrence]] townships before joining with the West Branch Shabakunk Creek, turning eastward and completely entering Lawrence. After passing underneath [[U.S. Route 206|Lawrence Road]], [[County Route 583 (New Jersey)|Princeton Pike]] and [[U.S. Route 1 Business (Trenton, New Jersey)|Brunswick Pike]], the stream is impounded within [[Colonial Lake]]. Below Colonial Lake, the stream crosses underneath the [[U.S. Route 1 in New Jersey|Trenton Freeway]] and the [[Delaware and Raritan Canal]] before finally reaching its terminus at the Assunpink Creek.

===West Branch===
The {{convert|5.3|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} West Branch of the Shabakunk Creek emerges from the airfield of [[Trenton-Mercer Airport]] in Ewing.  From there, it flows generally southeastward, quickly joining with several small, unnamed tributaries while passing underneath the Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad (formerly owned by the [[Reading Company|Reading Railroad]], now owned by [[Conrail]]), [[List of county routes in Mercer County, New Jersey#611|Scotch Road]] and [[List of county routes in Mercer County, New Jersey#636|Upper Ferry Road]]. It then passes underneath Carlton Avenue, [[List of county routes in Mercer County, New Jersey#643|Lower Ferry Road]], Stratford Avenue, Central Avenue, [[List of county routes in Mercer County, New Jersey#622|North Olden Avenue Extension]], [[New Jersey Route 31|Pennington Road]], [[List of county routes in Mercer County, New Jersey#636|Parkside Avenue]] and [[List of county routes in Mercer County, New Jersey#627|Prospect Street]]. At this point it turns northeasterly, passes under North Olden Avenue Extension again and finally flows underneath [[List of county routes in Mercer County, New Jersey#613|Spruce Street]]. Shortly thereafter it meets the main branch at the Ewing/Lawrence border. Much of the West Branch Shabakunk Creek's course between Pennington Road and Spruce Street is canalized due to heavy commercial development, with at least one structure built directly over the stream.

===Revolutionary War===
Under the command of Colonel [[Edward Hand]], a successful delaying action was fought at the Shabakunk Creek near Lawrence Road which prevented British forces from reaching Trenton before nightfall on January 2, 1777. This skirmish was part of the [[Battle of the Assunpink Creek|Second Battle of Trenton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmdb.org/Marker.asp?Marker=9888|title=Revolutionary War Site - Shabakunk Creek Marker|accessdate=May 26, 2013}}</ref>

===1996 flooding and associated improvements===
On June 12, 1996, a 100-year [[flash flood]] occurred on the West Branch Shabakunk Creek in Ewing. Over 7 inches of rain fell in just 4 hours, resulting in $10 million in damages and $24 million in municipal overtime costs due to cleanup efforts (in 1996 dollars).  Over 175 residences and 75 businesses were affected, and some businesses were closed for nearly 2 weeks due to the cleanup and repair of damage.  As a result, a $4.2 million flood and [[erosion control]] project was initiated to stabilize the banks and create storm water [[detention basin]]s along the more heavily developed central and southern portions of the creek's course.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americancityandcounty.com/mag/government_flood_controlflood_control|title=Flood control project brings economic stability|accessdate=May 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://landscapeonline.com/research/article/410|title=Ewing Township Erosion Control|accessdate=May 27, 2013}}</ref>
