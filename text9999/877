'''Klaus Riedel''' ([[August 2]] [[1907]] - [[August 4]] [[1944]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[rocket]] pioneer. He was involved in many early liquid-fuelled rocket experiments, and eventually worked on the [[V-2 missile]] programme at [[Peenem<U+00FC>nde]].

Riedel was born in [[Wilhelmshaven]], the son of a naval officer. His mother died when he was twelve years old, and his father two years later. The orphaned Klaus was raised by his grandmother in [[Bernstadt]]. He went on to study as a machinist at the Technical College of [[Berlin]] and to work at [[L<U+00F6>we]]. While in Berlin, he attended a public lecture on rocketry by [[Rudolf Nebel]] on behalf of Germany's amateur rocket group, the ''[[Verein f<U+00FC>r Raumschiffahrt]]'' (VfR - "Spaceflight Society") and joined the group straight away, becoming very active in its efforts to build a working rocket  that resulted in the [[Mirak rocket|Mirak]] and [[Repulsor rocket]]s, providing his family's farm as a testing ground.<ref>

After the VfR disbanded in 1933, Riedel was invited by [[Wernher von Braun]] to join him in the army's rocket programme. He accepted, and worked from Peenem<U+00FC>nde when the team moved there. Riedel's position was "Head of the Test Laboratory" and his work seems to have been mostly concerned with developing the mobile support equipment for the V-2. 

He was killed in a car accident two days after his thirty-seventh birthday.

There is a memorial and small museum dedicated to him in Bernstadt and in [[1970]] a crater on the moon was named after him.
