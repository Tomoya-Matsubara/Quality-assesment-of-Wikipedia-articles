'''HMT<ref>The use of both HMT - 'His Majesty's Trawler', and HMS - 'His Majesty's Ship' for vessels of this type is well attested by official records.</ref>  ''Bedfordshire''''' was an armed [[Naval trawler|anti-submarine trawler]] in the service of the [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War II]]. She was sunk by the [[Uboat]] [[German submarine U-558|''U-558'']] on 11 May 1942 off the coast of [[Ocracoke Island]] on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]], with the loss of all hands.

==Construction==
''Bedfordshire'' was a commercial [[trawling|fishing trawler]] built in 1935 by Smith's Dock Co. in [[Middlesbrough]], England and launched at [[Teesside]]. In 1939 she was sold to the [[Admiralty]]. Converted for anti-submarine patrols, she was armed with a 4-inch gun, machine guns, and [[depth charge]]s.

==Service on the American coast==
After [[Germany]] declared war on the United States on 11 December 1941, German U-boats quickly became a serious threat on the East Coast. The [[United States Navy]] was ill-prepared to defend against submarine warfare, and U-boats found it easy to pick off commercial shipping vessels, which traveled unescorted. The onslaught began in January 1942, when 35 Allied ships were sunk by U-boats off the American coast.<ref>Hancock, p. 414.</ref>

In March 1942, the Royal Navy sent 24 ships, including the ''Bedfordshire'', to assist the United States Navy with anti-submarine patrols along the East Coast.<ref name=Conn>Conn, p. 96.</ref> U-boats continued to terrorize local shipping, and 45 ships were lost between February and April 1942, with US defenses only managing to sink one U-boat ([[German submarine U-85 (1941)|''U-85'']]) during that period.<ref name=Conn />

On 10 May, ''Bedfordshire'' and HMT ''Loman''<ref>Possibly HMT ''St Loman'' or HMT ''Saint Loman''; sources vary.</ref> were dispatched from their base at [[Morehead City]] to search for a U-boat believed to be in the vicinity of Ocracoke Island. The ships were spotted by [[German submarine U-558|''U-558'']], under the command of [[Captain Lieutenant|Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant]] [[G<U+00FC>nther Krech]]. Later in the evening, Krech, believing his sub had been detected, fired on ''Loman'', but the British ship spotted the torpedoes and evaded them. At 05:40 on 11 May 1942, ''U-558'' fired a torpedo at ''Bedfordshire'', missed, and fired a second, which scored a direct hit and sank her immediately. All 37 men aboard were killed. One young marine crewman, Sam Nutt, 'survived' because he was arrested for a fight and missed boarding the ship in time for its last patrol.

The discovery of the bodies of two British seamen was the first indication to the US Navy that ''Bedfordshire'' may have met her end.<ref>Hickam, p. 207.</ref>  Although it was eventually presumed that ''Bedfordshire'' had been sunk by a submarine, her fate was not confirmed until ''U-558'' was sunk the following year off [[Cape Finisterre]], resulting in the capture of Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant Krech.  The ''Bedfordshire'' was attached to the US Navy, but her absence had not yet been noted when a Coast Guardsman discovered two bodies on the shores of Ocracoke Island on 14 May. They were identified as Sub-lieutenant Thomas Cunningham and telegraph operator Stanley Craig of the ''Bedfordshire''. The remains of the two servicemen were buried in a small plot next to a cemetery in Ocracoke Village. The [[White Ensign|Royal Navy flag]] draped over Cunningham's coffin was one of several that he himself had given to a local man less than a month earlier for funeral ceremonies.<ref>[http://www.ddorian.com/ocracoke/cemeteries.htm Graveyard of the Atlantic]</ref><ref name="Runyan, p. 163">Runyan, p. 163.</ref> 

Shortly thereafter, two additional unidentified bodies from the ship washed ashore on Ocracoke Island.  All four men were buried together on Ocracoke Island in what became known as the 'British Cemetery.'  A third unknown seaman of the HMT Bedfordshire washed ashore in nearby Hatteras and was buried next to the body of Engineer Officer Michael Cairns of the British ship ''San Delfino'', which was torpedoed and sunk on 9/4/1942. The two plots also became known as the "British Cemetery."  In late May or early June, a fifth body, that of Seaman Alfred Dryden, washed ashore at Swan Quarter, NC.  Dryden was buried in Oak Grove Baptist Cemetery at Creeds, Virginia, with three victims of ''HMT Kingston Ceylonite'' whose bodies washed ashore nearby.<ref>http://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/missions/battleoftheatlantic2/bedfordshire.html</ref>  

The two "British cemeteries" on Ocracoke and Hatteras were leased in 1976 in perpetuity to the British government for as long as the interred men rest there.  Formal custody is handled by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] and it provided the protocol headstones. Regular maintenance, however, is handled by the US Coast Guard and local residents as a gesture of gratitude and respect to the fallen men and an act of comity to the British government. A Royal Navy flag flies over the cemeteries, and a ceremony is held there each year on 11 May to honor the men of the ''Bedfordshire''.<ref>[http://www.offbeattravel.com/british-cemetery-outerbanks.html Offbeat travel:British Cemetery at Ocracoke, North Carolina]</ref> Although a private church cemetery, the British Commonwealth War Graves Commission also provided headstones for the four British servicemen interred at the Oak Grove Baptist Church in Leeds, Virginia, including Alfred Dryden of the ''Bedfordshire''. 

The wreck of the ''Bedfordshire'' was located in 1980 at {{coord|34|10|N|76|41|W|display=inline,title}}.<ref>[http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/6308.html U-boat.net: HMS ''Bedfordshire'' (FY-141)]</ref>
