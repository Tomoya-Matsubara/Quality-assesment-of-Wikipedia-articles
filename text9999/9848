The '''''Mississippi''-class battleships''', {{USS|Mississippi|BB-23|6}} and {{USS|Idaho|BB-24|6}}, served in the US Navy from 1908 to 1914. 

''[[USS Mississippi (BB-23)|USS Mississippi]]'' and ''[[USS Idaho (BB-24)|USS Idaho]]'' were designed in response to Congressional desire to cap the growth and expense of new battleships, whose size and cost had increased dramatically since the first U.S. battleships, the [[Indiana class battleship|Indiana class]] of 1893, had been authorized.  Displacement was limited to 13,000 tons, a reduction of 3,000 tons from the prior [[Connecticut class battleship|''Connecticut'' class]].<ref>See, J. Reilly, et al. ''American Battleships 1886-1923'', "Mississippi Class" at 186-187</ref>

In terms of design, the two ships were essentially a reduced version of the [[Connecticut class battleship|''Connecticut''s]] which had preceded them, and by comparison with which they sacrificed a knot of speed, four 7in guns, eight 3in guns, two torpedo tubes and some [[freeboard]].<ref>Reilly, et al., op. cit. at 202-203</ref>  They were indifferent sea boats and were obsolete upon commissioning in consequence of the advent of {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}.

Though intended to recapitulate in steel and steam the concept of the [[Seventy-four (ship)|74-gun]] [[third-rate]], which had formed the backbone of the sailing battle fleets of the previous century, the tactical and technical calculus of early 20th Century naval warfare had made the [[third-rate]] concept obsolete; to be viable, a battle line needed to consist entirely of what could be considered [[first-rate]] units. <ref>Ibid at 187</ref>

This combination of Congressional displacement restrictions and a flawed tactical premise produced a class that was never satisfactory in U.S. service.  They were close to being second-class units at a time and in a fleet which could neither afford to tie up tonnage and money in second-tier designs nor usefully place such warships in its battle line.  

Given the unsatisfactory nature of the design, the Navy opted to return to the prior design; {{USS|New Hampshire|BB-25|6}} was thus ordered as a repeat ''Connecticut'', and would be the last American [[pre-dreadnought]].  
 
The two units were sold to Greece in 1914 and as [[Greek battleship Limnos|''Limnos'']] and [[Greek battleship Kilkis|''Kilkis'']]. <ref>Ibid at 199-200</ref> The money realized from their sale was used to finance the addition of a third unit ({{USS|Idaho|BB-42}}), of the [[New Mexico class battleship|''New Mexico'' class]].<ref>Ibid at 202</ref>

As completed, both BB-23 and BB-24 carried a single military mast forward, but were retrofitted with [[lattice mast]]s fore and aft as part of the modernization of the fleet following the return of the [[Great White Fleet]].<ref>Ibid at 197</ref>

Following their transfer to the [[Royal Hellenic Navy]]  they served without substantial modification until they were sunk by German aircraft at [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] in April 1941, during [[World War II]].
