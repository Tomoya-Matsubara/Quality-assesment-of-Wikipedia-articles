'''Case Western Reserve School of Medicine''' ('''CWRU SOM, CaseMed''') is one of the graduate schools of [[Case Western Reserve University]]. It is a prestigious [[USA|American]] [[medical school]] located in the [[University Circle]] neighborhood of [[Cleveland, Ohio]].

The School of Medicine is included as a member of the "13 School Consortium" of elite medical schools.  Members of this group include: Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]], [[Duke University School of Medicine]], [[Harvard Medical School]], [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]], [[Stanford University School of Medicine]], [[Pritzker School of Medicine]] (University of Chicago), [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]], [[University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine]], [[University_of_Rochester_Medical_Center#School_of_Medicine_and_Dentistry|University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry]], [[Washington University School of Medicine]], [[Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University]], and [[Yale University School of Medicine]]. Admissions to CaseMed is highly competitive; in 2007, 6,077 applications were received and 1,235 were interviewed for 185 spots, with an acceptance rate of 7.6%. 

Prospective students have the option of three degree paths leading to a medical degree at the School of Medicine: the "University Program;" the "College Program" at the [[Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine]]; and the [[Medical Scientist Training Program]] (MSTP).

==History==
The School of Medicine has trained medical students, served the community, and been at the forefront of discovery in the City of [[Cleveland]] for 165 years. On November 1, 1843, five faculty members and sixty-seven students began the first medical lectures at the Medical Department of Western Reserve College (also known as the Cleveland Medical College). In 1852, the medical school became the second allopathic medical school to graduate a woman, Nancy Talbot Clarke.  Emily Blackwell, the younger sister of [[Elizabeth Blackwell]] (the first woman to graduate from medical school), was the second graduate at the WRU medical school and the third in the US to receive a regular medical degree.

In 1909, Arbraham Flexner, a graduate of [[Johns Hopkins University]] surveyed and evaluated each of the one hundred and fifty-five medical schools then extant in North America. The results of his investigation proved shocking: most "medical schools," for example, had entrance requirements no more stringent than either high school diploma or "rudiments or the recollection of a common school education." Only sixteen schools required at least two years of college as an entrance requirement, and of these, [[Johns Hopkins]], [[Harvard]], and [[Western Reserve]] were still the only ones to require an undergraduate degree. Although Johns Hopkins represented his ideal, Flexner also singled out the Medical Department of Western Reserve University for its praiseworthy admission standards and facilities. Flexner referred to Western Reserve as "already one of the substantial schools in the country." In a letter to Western Reserve president Charles F. Thwing he said, "The Medical Department of Western Reserve University is, next to Johns Hopkins..., the best in the country." 

A little over forty years later, in 1952, the Western Reserve University School of Medicine revolutionized medical education with the "new curriculum of 1952" and more advanced stages in 1968. This was the most progressive medical curriculum in the country at that time, integrating the basic and clinical sciences.

Historic research highlights at CaseMed include: Development of the modern technique for human blood transfusion using a cannula to connect blood vessels; first large-scale medical research project on humans in a study linking iodine with goiter prevention; pioneering use of drinking water chlorination; discovery of the cause of ptomaine food poisoning and development of serum against it and similar poisons; first surgical treatments of coronary artery disease; discovery of early treatment of strep throat infections to prevent rheumatic fever; development of an early heart-lung machine to be used during open-heart surgery; discovery of the Hageman factor in blood clotting, a major discovery in blood coagulation research; first description of how staphylococcus infections are transmitted, leading to required hand-washing between patients in infant nurseries; first description of what was later named Reye's syndrome; research leading to FDA approval of [[clozapine]], the most advanced treatment for schizophrenia in 40 years at the time; discovery of the gene for osteoarthritis; and creation with Athersys, Inc., of the world's first human artificial chromosome. 

Today the CWRU School of Medicine is the largest biomedical research institution in Ohio and the one of the largest in the nation, as measured by funding received from the National Institutes of Health. The School of Medicine has eight [[Nobel Prize]] holders among its alumni and former and current faculty, and also has graduates who have distinguished themselves as U.S. Surgeons General: [[Jesse Steinfeld]], MD, and [[David Satcher]], MD, PhD, and the current the Director of the CDC, [[Julie Gerberding]], MD.

==Education==
<!-- More information needed. -->

Building on its reputation for innovation in medical education, the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine introduced the WR<sup>2</sup> curriculum with the class entering in 2006.  The goal of the new curriculum is to unite the disciplines of medicine and public health.  It is designed to emphasize independent study, and scheduling choices, while providing mentored experiences in research during the first 18 months of school.  All students are required to complete a dedicated 4 month research block during their second, third, or fourth year of study.

===Degree Programs===
In addition to the traditional MD degree, students have the option of completing one of several dual degree programs of varying lengths at no additional cost.  Currently, the school has dual degree programs that offer: 

* [[MD/PhD]]
* MD/DMD - Combined Medical Doctor and [[Doctor of Dental Medicine]] Program
* [[MD/MPH]] - Combined Medical Doctor and Master of Public Health
* [[MD/MBA]] - Combined Medical Doctor and Master of Business Administration
* MD/MA in Bioethics
* MD/MS in Applied Anatomy
* MD/MS in Biomedical Investigation
* MD/MS in Biomedical Engineering
* MD/MA or MD/PhD in Anthropology

== Student life ==
=== Societies ===

Case Medical School is divided into four societies named after famous CaseMed alums.  Upon matriculation, students in the University Program are assigned to a society.  Each has a Society Dean who serves as an academic adviser to the students.   The societies are: 

*  [[Frederick C. Robbins]] Society
*  [[Emily Blackwell]] Society
*  [[David Satcher]] Society
*  [[Joseph Wearn]] Society

Every year, the four societies compete in "ISC Picnic" for the infamous Society Cup in a series of events (e.g. soccer, flag football, relay races etc.) to test physical talents of the students in each society. The Satcher Society currently holds the cup after a decisive win over Robbins who held the cup in 2007.

=== Doc Opera ===
Every year, students at Case Western Reserve SOM write, direct and perform a full length musical parody, lampooning Case Western Reserve, their professors, and themselves.  In recent years, the show has been a benefit for the [[Free Medical Clinic of Greater Cleveland]].
