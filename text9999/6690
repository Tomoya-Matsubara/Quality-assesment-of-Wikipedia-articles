'''Congo''' (1954<U+2013>1964) was a [[chimpanzee]] who learned how to draw and paint. Zoologist and surrealist painter [[Desmond Morris]] first observed his abilities when the chimp was offered a pencil and paper at two years of age. By the age of four, Congo had made 400 drawings and paintings over two years. His style has been described as "lyrical [[abstract impressionism]]".<ref name="timesonline">{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article569970.ece |title=Congo the chimpanzee |accessdate=2008-12-12 |author=Waldemar Januszczak |work=[[TimesOnline]] |date=2005-09-25}}</ref>

==Biography and works==
Congo was born in 1954. He learned to draw near the age of two, beginning when zoologist [[Desmond Morris]] offered Congo a pencil.<ref name="telegraph" /> Morris said, "He took [the pencil] and I placed a piece of card in front of him. This is how I recorded it at the time, 'Something strange was coming out of the end of the pencil. It was Congo's first line. It wandered a short way and then stopped. Would it happen again? Yes, it did, and again and again'."<ref name="telegraph" /> Morris soon observed that the chimp would draw [[circle]]s, and had a basic sense of composition in his drawings.<ref name="telegraph" /> He also showed the ability of symmetrical consistency between two sides of a sketch; when Morris drew a shape at one side of a piece of paper, Congo would balance the structure by making marks on the other half of the paper.<ref name="telegraph" /> Similarily, if a color on one side contained blue for example, he would add blue to the other side as well to keep balance.<ref name="timesonline" />

He soon began painting; the patterns he made were never distinguished, pictoral images, but usually of a vague "radiating fan pattern" in the [[abstract impressionism]] style.<ref name="telegraph" /> Between the ages of two and four, he produced about 400 drawings and paintings.<ref name="cbs">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/06/20/entertainment/main703057.shtml|title=Dead Chimp's Art Sells Big|accessdate=2008-06-01|date=2005-06-20|publisher=CBS News}}</ref>

Through that time, Congo developed a familiarity with his routinely painting sessions with Morris. When a picture was taken away that he didn't consider complete, Congo would reportedly begin to scream and "throw fits".<ref name="timesonline" /> Also, if the ape considered one of his drawings to be finished, he would refuse to continue painting even if someone tried to persuade him to do so.<ref name="timesonline" />

In the late 1950s, he made appearances on the British television show ''[[Zootime]]'', which was presented live from the [[London Zoo]] by Desmond Morris.<ref name="timesonline" /> He died at ten years of age in 1964 of [[tuberculosis]].<ref name="telegraph">{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1492463/Art-world-goes-wild-for-chimpanzees-paintings-as-Warhol-work-flops.html |title=Art world goes wild for chimpanzee's paintings as Warhol work flops |work=[[Telegraph.co.uk]] |date=2008-06-21 |accessdate=2008-12-10}}</ref>

==Reception==
Media reaction to Congo's painting abilities were mixed, although relatively positive and accepted with interest. [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]] painter [[Pablo Picasso]] was reportedly a "fan" of his paintings, and hung one of the ape's pictures on his studio wall after receiving it as a gift.<ref name="timesonline" /><ref name="cbs" />

On June 20, 2005, Congo's paintings were included in an auction at [[Bonhams]] alongside works by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]] and [[Warhol]] <U+2014> Congo's painting sold for more than expected whilst Renoir's and Warhol's did not sell. American collector Howard Hong purchased three of Congo's works for US$26,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4712948|title=No Chump Change for Chimp Art|accessdate=2008-06-01
