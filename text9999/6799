'''Syracuse University''', commonly referred to as '''Syracuse''', ''''Cuse''', or '''SU''',<ref name="Marrone's Focus is on the 'Cuse"/> is a private research university located in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[New York]], United States. Its roots can be traced back to Genesee Wesleyan Seminary, founded by the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] in 1832, which also later founded [[Genesee College]]. Following several years of debate over relocating the college to Syracuse, the university was founded independent of the college in 1870. Since 1920, the university has identified itself as [[nonsectarian]],<ref name="rankingsandreviews"/><ref name="princetonreview"/><ref name="collegestats"/><ref name="youniversitytv"/><ref name="cappex"/><ref name="Syracuse University"/> although it maintains a relationship with [[The United Methodist Church]].<ref name="Bylaws"/><ref name="Relatedness"/><ref name="William Joseph Whalen - Hospitals & Universities"/><ref name="IAMSCU"/><ref name="SU & UMC"/>

The campus is located in the [[University Hill, Syracuse|University Hill]] neighborhood of Syracuse, east and southeast of [[Downtown Syracuse|downtown]], on one of the larger hills. Its large campus features an eclectic mix of buildings, ranging from nineteenth-century [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] structures to contemporary buildings. SU is organized into 13 schools and colleges, with nationally recognized programs in [[Syracuse University School of Information Studies|information studies and library science]], [[Syracuse University School of Architecture|architecture]], [[S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications|communications]], [[business administration]], [[public administration]], [[engineering]] and the [[Syracuse University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]].

Syracuse University athletic teams, known as the [[Syracuse Orange|Orange]], participate in 20 intercollegiate sports. SU is a member of the [[Big East Conference]] for all [[NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] athletics, except for women's [[ice hockey]], and the [[College rowing (United States)|rowing team]]. On July 1, 2013, Syracuse will leave the Big East for the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]. SU is also a member of the [[Eastern College Athletic Conference]].<ref name="Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC)"/>

==History==

===Founding===
[[File:Annual Class of Syracuse University, July 1876, from Robert N. Dennis collection of stereoscopic views.jpg|thumb|left|400px|First Annual Class of Syracuse University.]]

The [[Genesee Wesleyan Seminary]] was founded in 1832 by the Genesee [[Annual Conference]] of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] in Lima, New York, south of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]. In 1850, it was resolved to enlarge the institution from a seminary into a college, or to connect a college with the seminary, becoming [[Genesee College]]. However, the location was soon thought by many to be insufficiently central. Its difficulties were compounded by the next set of technological changes: the railroad that displaced the Erie Canal as the region's economic engine bypassed Lima completely. The trustees of the struggling college then decided to seek a locale whose economic and transportation advantages could provide a better base of support. The college began looking for a new home at the same time that Syracuse, ninety miles to the east, was engaged in a search to bring a university to the city, having failed to convince [[Ezra Cornell]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]] to locate [[Cornell University]] there rather than in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]].<ref name="PioneerYears"/><ref name="Greene"/> White pressed that the university should locate on the hill in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] (the current location of Syracuse University) due to the city's attractive transportation hub, which would ease the recruitment of faculty, students, and other persons of note. However, as a young carpenter working in Syracuse, Cornell had been twice robbed of his wages,<ref name="reminiscences"/><ref name="university"/> and thereafter considered Syracuse a [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] insisting that the university be located in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] on his large farm on East Hill, overlooking the town and [[Cayuga Lake]].

Meanwhile, there were several years of dispute between the Methodist ministers, Lima, and contending cities across the state, over proposals to move Genesee College to Syracuse.  At the time, the ministers wanted a share of the funds from the [[Morrill Land Grant Act]] for Genesee College. Eventually, they agreed to a quid-pro quo donation of $25,000 from Ezra Cornell in exchange for their support for his bill.  Cornell insisted the bargain be written into the bill and Cornell became New York State's Land Grant University in 1865. In 1869, Genesee College obtained New York State approval to move to Syracuse, but Lima got a court injunction to block the move, and Genesee stayed in Lima until it was dissolved in 1875.<ref name="found"/> At its founding on March 24, 1870, the state of New York granted the University its charter independent of Genesee College.<ref name=found/>  The City of Syracuse offered $100,000 to establish the school.<ref name=found/> [[Jesse T. Peck|Bishop Jesse Truesdell Peck]] donated $25,000 to the proposed school<ref name="dickinson"/> and was elected the first president of the Board of Trustees.<ref name="Greene"/> Rev. Daniel Steele, a former Genesee College president, served as the first administrative leader of Syracuse until its Chancellor was appointed.<ref name="The Hill: an illustrated biography of Syracuse University, 1870<U+2013>present"/> The university opened in September 1871 in rented space downtown.<ref name=found/> George F. Comstock, a member of the new University's Board of Trustees, had offered the school {{convert|50|acre|m2}} of farmland on a hillside to the southeast of the city center. Comstock intended Syracuse University and the hill to develop as an integrated whole; a contemporary account described the latter as "a beautiful town ... springing up on the hillside and a community of refined and cultivated membership ... established near the spot which will soon be the center of a great and beneficent educational institution."<ref name="architectural"/>

The university was founded as coeducational, and President Peck stated at the opening ceremonies, "The conditions of admission shall be equal to all persons... there shall be no invidious discrimination here against woman.... brains and heart shall have a fair chance... "<ref name="coed"/> Syracuse implemented this policy with a high proportion of women students. The ratio between male and female students during the 19th century in the College of Liberal Arts was approximately even. The College of Fine Arts was predominantly female, and a low ratio of women enrolled as students in the College of Medicine and the College of Law.<ref name=coed/> Men and women were taught together in the same courses, and many extra-curricular activities were coeducational as well. Syracuse also developed "women-only" organizations, such as the Ladies' Glee Club, the Y.W.C.A. and various sororities.<ref name=coed/>

===Expansion===
Coeducation at Syracuse traced its roots to the early days of the Genesee College where suffragists like [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]] and [[Belva Lockwood]] began to distinguish themselves nationally. However, the progressive "co-ed" policies initiated at Genesee would soon find controversy at the new university in Syracuse.<ref name="Greene"/>  Colleges and universities admitted few women students in the 1870s. Administrators and faculty argued women had inferior minds and could not master mathematics and the classics. Dr. [[Erastus Otis Haven]], Syracuse University chancellor and former president of the [[University of Michigan]] and [[Northwestern University]], maintained that women should receive the advantages of higher education. He enrolled his daughter, Frances, at SU, where she was initiated in the newly formed Gamma Phi Beta sorority.<ref name="Greene"/>

[[File:HendricksChapel.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Hendricks Chapel is one of the older buildings on the SU campus]]

In the late 1880s the University resumed construction on the south side of University Place. Holden Observatory (1887) was followed by two Romanesque Revival buildings <U+2013> von Ranke Library (1889), now Tolley Administration Building, and Crouse College (1889). Together with the Hall of Languages, these first buildings formed the basis for the "Old Row," a grouping which, along with its companion Lawn, established one of Syracuse's most enduring images.<ref name="architectural"/> The emphatically linear organization of these buildings along the brow of the hill follows a tradition of American campus planning which dates to the construction of the "Yale Row" in the 1790s. At Syracuse, the Old Row continued to provide the framework for growth well into the twentieth century.<ref name="architectural"/>

From its founding until through early 1920s, the University grew rapidly. It offered programs in the physical sciences and modern languages, and in 1873, Syracuse added one of the first architecture programs in the U.S.<ref name="Greene2"/> In 1874, Syracuse created the nation's first bachelor of fine arts degree,<ref name="Syracuse University History"/> and in 1876, the school offered its first post-graduate courses in the College of Arts and Sciences.<ref name="Greene2"/> SU created its first doctoral program in 1911.<ref name="SU1906"/> SU's school of journalism, now the [[S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications]], was established at Syracuse in 1934.<ref name="SU1931"/>

The growth of Syracuse University from a small liberal arts college into a major comprehensive university were due to the efforts of two men, Chancellor [[James Roscoe Day|James Day]] and [[John Dustin Archbold|John Archbold]]. James Roscoe Day was serving the Calvary Church in New York City where he befriended Archbold. Together, the two dynamic figures would oversee the first of two great periods of campus renewal in Syracuse's history.<ref name="Greene"/>

John Dustin Archbold was a capitalist, philanthropist, and President of the Board of Trustees at Syracuse University. He was known as John D. Rockefeller<U+2019>s right hand man and successor at the [[Standard Oil]] Company. He was a close friend of Syracuse University Chancellor James R. Day, and gave almost $6&nbsp;million to the University over his lifetime.<ref name="Greene"/> Said a journalist in 1917:
<blockquote>Mr. Archbold<U+2019>s ... is the president of the board of trustees of Syracuse University, an institution which has prospered so remarkably since his connection with it that its student roll has increased from hundreds to over 4,000, including 1,500 young women, placing it in the ranks of the foremost institutions of learning in the United States.<ref name="Men who are making America"/></blockquote>
In addition to keeping the university financially solvent during its early years, he also contributed funds for eight buildings, including the full cost of Archbold Stadium (opened 1907, demolished 1978), Sims Hall (men's dormitory, 1907), the Archbold Gymnasium (1909, nearly destroyed by fire in 1947, but still in use), and the oval athletic field.

===Modern===
After [[World War II]], Syracuse University began to transform into a major research institution. Enrollment increased in the four years after the war due to the [[G.I. Bill]], which paid tuition, room, board, and a small allowance for veterans returning from World War II. In 1946, SU admitted 9,464 freshmen, nearly four times greater than the previous incoming class.<ref name="SU1931"/>  Branch campuses were established in [[Endicott, New York]] and [[Utica, New York]].
<blockquote>The velocity with which the university sped through its change into a major research institution was astounding. By the end of the 1950s, Syracuse ranked twelfth nationally in terms of the amount of its sponsored research, and it had over four hundred professors and graduate students engaging in that investigation.<ref name="Greene2"/></blockquote>

From the early 1950s through the 1960s, Syracuse University added programs and staff that continued the transformation of the school into a research university. In 1954, Arthur Phillips was recruited from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and started the first [[pathogen]]-free animal research laboratory. The lab focused on studying medical problems using animal models. The School of Social Work, which eventually merged into the College of Human Ecology, was founded in 1956.<ref name="Syracuse University History, 1951<U+2013>1960"/>  Syracuse's College of Engineering also founded the nation's second oldest computer engineering and bioengineering programs. In 1962, [[Samuel Irving Newhouse, Sr.]] donated $15&nbsp;million to begin construction of a school of communications, eventually known as the [[SI Newhouse School of Public Communications]]. In 1966, Syracuse University was admitted to the [[Association of American Universities]], an [[organization]] of leading research [[university|universities]] devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic [[research]] and education.<ref name="Syracuse University History, 1961<U+2013>1970"/>

===Pan Am Flight 103===
[[Image:Syracuse University Flight 103 Memorial.jpg|thumb|200px|right|SU's Flight 103 Memorial]]
{{main|Pan Am Flight 103}}
On December 21, 1988, 35 Syracuse University students were killed in the terrorist bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103]] over [[Lockerbie, Scotland|Lockerbie]], [[Scotland]]. The students were returning from a study-abroad program in Europe.

That evening, Syracuse University went on with a [[basketball]] game just hours after the attack, for which it was severely criticized.<ref name="Conduct"/> The conduct of university officials in making the decision was also brought to the attention of the NCAA.<ref name="Conduct"/> The day after the bombing, the university's chancellor, [[Melvin A. Eggers]], said on nationwide television that he should have canceled the event.<ref name="Conduct"/><ref name="A Tragic End to the Semester"/> After the [[September 11 attacks|attacks on September 11, 2001]], the NCAA ordered ''all'' football games scheduled for the weekend after the attacks canceled so that schools do not make the same mistake Syracuse University did after Pan Am Flight 103.<ref name="Many Sporting Events Called Off or Postponed"/><ref name="Pan Am Horror Recalled On the Night 270 People Died, SU Played On"/> (the bombing of Flight 103 was the deadliest terrorist attack against the United States prior to the attacks on September 11, 2001.<ref name="An Act of War?<U+2013>On the 15th Anniversary a Former Pilot Compares the Downing of Pan Am 103 to the Sept. 11, 2001 Attacks on America"/><ref name="20 years later, pain of Lockerbie still fresh"/>)

In April 1990, Syracuse University dedicated a memorial wall to the students killed on Flight 103, constructed at the entrance to the main campus in front of the Hall of Languages. Every year the university holds "Remembrance Week" during the fall semester to commemorate the students. On December 21 a service in the university's chapel at 2:03&nbsp;p.m. (19:03&nbsp;[[UTC]]) marks the exact minute on that date in 1988 when the plane exploded. The University also maintains a link to the tragedy with the "Remembrance Scholars" program, when 35 senior students receive scholarships during their final year at the University. With the "Lockerbie Scholars" program, two graduating students from Lockerbie Academy study at Syracuse for one year.<ref name="Lockerbie Scholars"/>

==Campus==

The university is set on a campus that features an eclectic mix of buildings, ranging from nineteenth-century [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] structures to contemporary buildings designed by renowned architects such as [[I.M. Pei]]. The center of campus, with its grass quadrangle, landscaped walkways, and outdoor sculptures, offers students the amenities of a traditional college experience. The university overlooks [[downtown Syracuse]], a medium-sized city (140,600 residents in 2008).<ref name="Best Places to Live-Syracuse, NY"/>  The school also owns a [[Sheraton Hotel]],<ref name="S.U. Acquires Sheraton Hotel"/> Drumlins Country Club<U+2014>a nearby [[golf course]],<ref name="Drumlins Country Club. Syracuse, New York."/> the [[Joseph Lubin|Joseph I.

[[File:Pi Chapter House of Psi Upsilon Fraternity 1.jpg|thumb|left|Pi Chapter House of Psi Upsilon Fraternity]]

===Main campus===
Also called "North Campus," the Main Campus contains nearly all academic buildings and residence halls. Its centerpiece is The Kenneth A. Shaw Quadrangle, more affectionately known as "The Quad", which is surrounded by academic and administrative buildings. The North Campus represents a large portion of the [[University Hill, Syracuse|University Hill]] neighborhood. Buses run to South Campus, as well as [[downtown Syracuse]] and other locations in the city.<ref name="Syracuse University Map"/> About 70 percent of students live in University housing. First- and second-year students are required to live on campus. All 22 residence halls are coeducational and each contain a lounge, laundry facility, and various social/study spaces. Residence halls are secured with a card access system. Residence halls are located on both Main Campus and South Campus, the latter of which is a five-minute ride via bus.  Learning communities and interest housing options are also available. Food facilities include six residential dining centers, two food courts, and several cafes.

[[File:Crousecollegesu.jpg|thumb|right|Crouse College]]

The [[Comstock Tract Buildings]], a historic district of older buildings on the campus, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.<ref name="nrhptextComstock"/>  Three buildings on campus<U+2014>the [[Crouse College, Syracuse University|Crouse Memorial College]] and the [[Hall of Languages, Syracuse University|Hall of Languages]], and the [[Pi Chapter House of Psi Upsilon Fraternity]]<U+2014>are individually listed on the National Register.<ref name="nris"/>

A few blocks walk from Main Campus on East Genesee St, the [[Syracuse Stage]] building includes two [[proscenium]] theatres. The Storch is used primarily by the Drama Department and the Archbold is used primarily by Syracuse Stage, a professional [[Regional theater in the United States|regional theatre]].

===South campus===
After World War II, a large, undeveloped hill owned by the university was used to house returning [[veterans]] in military-style campus housing. During the 1970s, this housing was replaced by permanent two-level townhouses for two or three students each, or for graduate family housing. There are also three small residence halls which feature open doubles and a kitchen on every floor.
South Campus is also home to the Institute for Sensory Research, Tennity Ice Pavilion, Goldstein Student Center, Skytop Office Building and 621 Skytop Road (for administration), and the InnComplete Pub, a graduate student bar. Just north is the headquarters of SU Athletics located in the Manley Athletics Complex. Approximately 2,500 students live on the South Campus, which is connected to the main campus by frequent bus service.

===Downtown===
In December 2004, the university announced that it had purchased or leased twelve buildings in [[downtown Syracuse]]. Five Design Programs; Communication, Advertising, Interiors, Industrial, and Fashion; reside permanently in the newly renovated facilities, fittingly called [[The Warehouse (Syracuse)|The Warehouse]], which was renovated by [[Gluckman Mayner Architects]]. Both programs were chosen to be located in the downtown area because of their history of working on projects directly with the community. The Warehouse also houses a contemporary art space that commissions, exhibits, and promotes the work of local and international artists in a variety of media. Hundreds of students and faculty have also been affected by the temporary move of the School of Architecture downtown for the $12&nbsp;million renovation of its campus facility, Slocum Hall.

Since 2009, the Syracuse Center of Excellence in Environmental and Energy Systems, led by Syracuse University in partnership with [[Clarkson University]] and the [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry|College Environmental Science and Forestry]], creates innovations in environmental and energy technologies that improve human health and productivity, security, and sustainability in urban and built environments.<ref name="Syracuse Center of Excellence in Environmental and Energy Innovations"/><ref name="Excellence in Environmental and Energy Innovations"/> The [[Department of African American Studies - Syracuse University#Paul Robeson Performing Arts Company (PRPAC)|Paul Robeson Performing Arts Company]] and the [[Department of African American Studies - Syracuse University#Community Folk Art Center (CFAC)|Community Folk Art Center]] will also be located downtown. On March 31, 2006, the university and the city announced an initiative to connect the main campus of the university with the arts and culture areas of downtown Syracuse and The Warehouse.<ref name="Welcome to Syracuse University News"/> At a new green data center, a natural gas-fueled on-site electrical co-generation system generates 100 percent of the center<U+2019>s electricity while helping cool a couple of buildings.<ref name="go-green"/>

The Connective Corridor project, supported by of public and private funds, will be a strip of cultural development that will connect the main campus of the university to downtown Syracuse, NY. In 2008, an [[Civil engineering|engineering]] firm is studying traffic patterns and lighting to commence the project. A design competition was held to determine the best design for the project.<ref name="The Connective Corridor<U+2014>Project Overview"/>

===Metropolitan Satellite Locations===
SU has established an admissions presence in Los Angeles, California that will enhance the University<U+2019>s visibility on the West Coast and will join the University<U+2019>s West Coast offices of alumni relations, institutional advancement, and the LA semester program in the same location.

Syracuse University has also established an admissions presence in New York City and Atlanta, Georgia.

===Art collection===
SU has a permanent art collection of over 45,000 objects from artists including Picasso, Rembrandt, Hopper, Tiffany and Wyeth. More than 100 important paintings, sculptures, and murals are displayed in public places around campus. Notable sculptures on campus include [[Sol LeWitt]]'s  ''Six Curved Walls'', [[Anna Hyatt Huntington]]'s ''Diana'', [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]]'s ''George Washington'', [[Antoine Bourdelle]]'s ''Herakles'', [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]]'s ''Lincoln'', [[Malvina Hoffman]]'s ''The Struggle of Elemental Man,'' and [[Ivan Mestrovic]]'s ''Moses'', ''Job'' and ''Supplicant Persephone''.

==Organization==
Syracuse is governed by a 70 member Board of Trustees, with 64 trustees elected by the Board to four-year terms, and six elected by the alumni to four-year terms.  Of the 64 Board elected Trustees, three must represent specified conferences of the [[United Methodist Church]]. In addition, the chancellor and the President of the Syracuse Alumni Association serve as ex officio voting Trustees. Two students and one faculty member serve as non-voting representatives to the Board of Trustees.<ref name="bylaws"/>  The Board of Trustees selects, and sets the salary of, the chancellor. The Syracuse University Bylaws also establish a University Senate with "general supervision over all educational matters concerning the University as a whole...."  The Senate consists of administrators, faculty, students and staff.<ref name=bylaws/>

{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
[[Image:CitrusTV controlroom.jpg|300px|right|thumb|The CitrusTV control room during a taping of CitrusTV News]]

[[CitrusTV]] (formerly UUTV, HillTV and Synapse) is the university's entirely student-run television studio, and one of the largest student-run TV studios in the country with over 300 active members.<ref name="Citrus-members"/> CitrusTV produces news, sports, and entertainment content that appears on the university's campus cable channel, the [[Orange Television Network]], and online on the CitrusTV.net website. Some content also appears in Central New York on the cable channel [[Time Warner Cable Sports]]. The station used to be a part of University Union, the largest student organization on campus{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the statistic|date=June 2011}}, until it split to become its own recognized student organization in 2004. The station was briefly known as HillTV until the middle of the fall 2005 semester, when the university temporarily shut the station down for a controversial entertainment episode and demanded its reform. The station is located in the Robert B. Menschel Media Center, at the Waverly Avenue side of Watson Hall.

The [[Orange Television Network]] is the university-controlled campus cable TV station. It is available on channel 2 in all campus buildings, and on channel 2.1 in high definition.

The school's independent student newspaper is ''[[The Daily Orange]]'', founded in 1903 and independent since 1971. The D.O. Alumni Association recently celebrated the paper's 100th anniversary.

[[WAER]] (88.3 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]) is located on the campus of SU, and is an auxiliary service of the school. The station features a jazz music and [[National Public Radio]] format, with a news and music staff providing 24-hour programming. It is best known for its sports staff, which has produced the likes of [[Bob Costas]], [[Marv Albert]], [[Mike Tirico]], [[Sean McDonough]], [[Ian Eagle]], [[Brian Higgins]], and [[Dick Stockton]]. [[Lou Reed]] also hosted a free-format show on WAER during his time at Syracuse University; this free-format radio tradition at Syracuse is carried on by WERW.

[[WJPZ]] is a radio station owned and operated entirely by SU students. It broadcasts at 89.1 FM at an effective radiated power of 100 watts and can be heard throughout Syracuse, the rest of Onondaga County, and beyond to the north and east. WJPZ programs a tight CHR (Contemporary Hit Radio, or Top 40) format. Although operated by students, it is an independent organization which is incorporated and licensed by the FCC as WJPZ Radio, Inc. It is neither owned nor controlled by Syracuse University, but it does lease studio and transmitter facilities on Syracuse University property.

[[WERW]] is the entirely student-run, free format [[carrier current]] [[radio station]] on the SU campus. It is the only campus radio station currently being broadcast on iTunes college radio. The station can also be heard at 1570 AM. The studios are located in the Schine Student Center. Originally operating at 750AM, WERW was available only in the university's dorms and some other campus buildings. The station's current low power broadcast tower was erected atop the Booth Hall dormitory in 1995 to allow it to broadcast at 1570AM. With this new tower, WERW could be heard all across the university campus and in adjacent areas of the city of Syracuse.

There are also multiple student-run magazines and other print publications, including: The Student Voice, Jerk Magazine, What the Health, 360, and Equal Time.<ref name="Ed2010"/>

===Student government===
Founded in 1957, the Student Association (SA) represents the undergraduate students of both SU and ESF. The SA, through the Student Assembly, oversees the allocation and designation of the Student Activity Fee that was first collected in the 1968<U+2013>69 school year. The goals of the SA are to participate through a unified student voice in the formulation of Syracuse University rules and regulations. The SA-SGA Alumni Organization maintains the history and an organizational timeline on its website.<ref name="Student Association"/> Students elect two non-voting representatives to the Board of Trustees.<ref name=bylaws/>

The graduate students at Syracuse University are represented by the Graduate Student Organization (GSO) while the law students at Syracuse University are represented by the Law Student Senate. Each of the three organizations elects students to serve in the Syracuse University Senate, which also includes faculty and staff and is chaired by the SU Chancellor.

===Fraternities and sororities===
{{Main|Syracuse University fraternity and sorority system}}
The Syracuse University [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] and [[sorority]] system offers organizations that are members of the [[National Panhellenic Conference|Panhellenic Council]] (NPC), the [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|Interfraternity Council]] (IFC), the [[National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations]], the [[National Multicultural Greek Council]], and the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]] (NPHC). In addition to SU students, ESF students are permitted to join the university's fraternity and sorority system.

The oldest fraternity at SU is [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]], which established a chapter in 1871 soon after the founding of the university, followed by [[Psi Upsilon]] in 1875 and [[Phi Kappa Psi]] in 1884.<ref name="greekhistory"/> Sororities were also a part of the early history of SU. [[Alpha Phi]] was founded at SU in 1872, followed by [[Gamma Phi Beta]] in 1874 and [[Alpha Gamma Delta]] in 1904. [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] established a chapter at SU in 1910, and was reorganized in 1949 and 1973.<ref name="Alpha Phi Alpha - Delta Zeta Chapter - Syracuse University"/> [[Alpha Phi Delta]], the only historically Italian-American heritage fraternity, was founded at SU in 1914. The first NPHC fraternity, [[Omega Psi Phi]], was established at SU in 1922, and the first NPHC sorority, [[Delta Sigma Theta]] in 1973.<ref name="greekhistory"/> University policy prohibits fraternities and sororities from discriminating "on the basis of race, creed, color, gender, national origin, religion, marital status, age, disability, sexual orientation, or status as a disabled veteran or a veteran of the Vietnam era."<ref name="Chapter Development Plan"/>

===Syracuse University Ambulance===
[http://sua.syr.edu Syracuse University Ambulance], commonly referred to as SUA, is a SU Health Services-based student organization that responds to over 1,500 medical emergencies each year. Providing [[basic life support]] (BLS), rapid cardiac [[defibrillation]], emergent and non-emergent transportation, and special event standby services, SUA operates two full-time transporting ambulances, a supervisor's fly car, and a MCI trailer for [[mass-casualty incident]]s. Additionally, SUA operates four transport vans for non-emergency transports. [[Advanced life support]] (ALS) mutual aid is provided by the City of Syracuse's private [[Emergency medical services|EMS]] provider, [[Rural/Metro]] Medical Services. SUA was formed in 1973 by a group of students out of a need for emergency medical services on campus. Starting with only a few members and meager equipment, the Syracuse University Medical Crisis Unit was formed. The organization has evolved greatly over time but, with 70+ volunteer students, remains a student-run organization to this day. SUA provides emergency and non-emergency services 24-hours a day, 7-days a week during the academic school year and is funded by a portion of the student health fee.

{{main|Syracuse Orange}}
[[Image:Syracuse Football 2005 Opener.jpg|thumb|250px|Syracuse Orange football team entering the [[Carrier Dome]].]]
Syracuse University's sports teams have "the Orange" nickname since 2004, although the former names of Orangemen and Orangewomen are still used. The school's mascot is [[Otto the Orange]]. SU fields intercollegiate teams in eight men's sports and 12 women's sports, but they do not sponsor a Baseball program in the Big East Conference.

Most of Syracuse University's intercollegiate teams participate in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] in the [[Big East Conference]]. The [[Syracuse Orange women's ice hockey]] team participates in [[College Hockey America]]. [[College rowing (United States)|Crew]] participates in the [[Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges]]. The men's and women's basketball teams, the football team, and both the men's and women's lacrosse teams play in the [[Carrier Dome]]. Other sports are located at the nearby [[Manley Field House]], except ice hockey which takes place in the [[Tennity Ice Skating Pavilion]].

On September 18, 2011, it was announced that the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] had officially extended an invitation to Syracuse to join the ACC after approving the university's application.  The Orange is set to join the ACC on July 1, 2013.<ref name="ACC"/>

SU has reached 28 team national championships, including 14 men's lacrosse, six men's crew, two [[cross country running]], and one each in [[boxing]], [[College football|football]], and women's lacrosse.<ref name="SU Athletics <U+2013> Syracuse National Champions"/> Under long-time head coach [[Jim Boeheim]], [[Syracuse Orange men's basketball|men's basketball team]] won seven [[Big East]] regular season championships, five [[Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|Big East Tournament]] championships, and 25 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] appearances, including the [[2003 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2003 NCAA championship]]. Most recently, Syracuse reached the 3rd round of the 2011 NCAA tournament. The men's basketball team holds the largest on campus attendance record of 34,616 attendees. The record was set in the Carrier Dome playing Villanova on Sat.,Feb.27 2010.

In 1959, Syracuse earned its first [[NCAA Division I-A national football champions|National Championship]] following an undefeated football season and a Cotton Bowl victory over [[University of Texas at Austin|Texas]]. The team featured sophomore running back [[Ernie Davis]] who, in 1961, became the first African-American to win the [[Heisman Trophy]]. Davis was slated to play for the [[Cleveland Browns]] in the same backfield as [[Jim Brown]], but died of [[leukemia]] before being able to play professionally.<ref name="cityofelmira"/>

Syracuse played its first intercollegiate lacrosse game in 1916, and captured its first USILA championship in 1920. It won USILA championships in 1922, 1924, and 1925. In the modern NCAA era, Syracuse is the first school to capture 11 National Championships, the most of any team in college lacrosse history. Syracuse currently won two men's Div I lacrosse championships in 2008 and 2009 seasons, and reached the quarterfinals in 2011.<ref name="suathletics"/> The women's lacrosse team reached the NCAA Division I National Championship game for the first time in school history in 2012, which they lost to Northwestern.

Toward the end of the 1970s, Syracuse University was under pressure to improve its football facilities in order to remain a NCAA Division I football school. Its small concrete stadium, [[Archbold Stadium]], was seventy years old and not up to the standards of other schools. The stadium could not be expanded; it had been reduced from 40,000 seats to 26,000 due to the fire codes. Syracuse University decided to build a new stadium. In 1978, Archbold Stadium was demolished to make way for the Carrier Dome, which was to have a domed [[Teflon]]-coated, [[fiberglass]] [[air-supported structure|inflatable roof]]. It would also serve as the home for the men's basketball team, as a replacement for Manley Field House. The Carrier Dome was constructed between April 1979 and September 1980. The total construction cost was $26.85&nbsp;million, including a $2.75&nbsp;million [[naming rights|naming gift]] from the [[Carrier Corporation]].<ref name="Carrier 100th Anniversary: Dome Sweet Dome"/>

On September 18, 2011, Syracuse University officially announced that it was leaving the [[Big East Conference]] to join the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]].<ref name="Syracuse, Pitt officially leave for ACC"/>

===Affiliated Institutions===

====State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry====
{{main|State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry}}

The College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) has a long affiliation with Syracuse University, shares many campus resources, and operates its main academic campus immediately adjacent to Syracuse University. ESF was founded in 1911 as the [[History of the New York State College of Forestry|New York State College of Forestry]] at Syracuse University, under the leadership of Syracuse University Trustee [[Louis Marshall]], with the active support of Syracuse University Chancellor Day. Its founding followed the Governor's veto of annual appropriations to a separate [[New York State College of Forestry at Cornell]].<ref name="agriculture"/>

ESF is an autonomous institution, administratively separate from SU, while resources, facilities, and some infrastructure are shared. The two schools share a common Schedule of Classes; students at both institutions may take courses at the other, and degrees from ESF bear the Syracuse University seal along with the State University of New York. A number of concurrent degree programs and certificates are offered between the schools, as well. The college receives an annual appropriation as part of the SUNY budget and the state builds and maintains all of the college's educational facilities. The state has similar relationships with five [[statutory college]]s that are at [[Alfred University]] and [[Cornell University]].

ESF faculty, students, and students' families join those from SU to take part in a joint convocation ceremony at the beginning of the academic year in August, and joint commencement exercises in May. ESF and SU students share access to libraries, recreational facilities, student clubs, and other activities at both institutions, except for the schools' intercollegiate sports teams, affiliated with the NCAA and NAIA, respectively. First-year ESF students live in the newly constructed Centennial Hall located on ESF's main campus.<ref name="The ESF-SU Relationship"/>

====State University of New York Upstate Medical University====
{{main|State University of New York Upstate Medical University}}

Both the conferences and the Board may recommend persons for election as Organization Trustees. Today Syracuse University is considered a Methodist-related institution. Syracuse University's affiliation is expressed in the tradition, though not regulation, of having a United Methodist minister serve as dean of Hendricks Chapel and in the University's participation in the annual University Teacher/Scholar Award sponsored by the Methodist Church. In addition, the University administers a number of Methodist-funded scholarships and houses the Bishop Ledden Endowed Professorship in the Department of Religion.|publisher = Syracuse University|accessdate = 24 March 2012|date=15 June 2010}}</ref>

Some of their one hundred colleges and universities have all but severed ties with the denominations, but others remain definitely Methodist: Syracuse, Boston, Emory, Duke, Drew, Denver, and Southern Methodist. The church operates three hundred sixty schools and institutions overseas. Methodists established Goodwill Industries in 1907 to help handicapped persons help themselves by repairing and selling old furniture and clothes. The United Methodist Church runs seventy-two hospitals in the United States.|publisher = [[Our Sunday Visitor]]|accessdate = 2010-03-27}}</ref>
