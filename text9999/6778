The '''''Derfflinger'' class''' was a group of three [[battlecruiser]]s ({{lang-de|Schlachtkreuzer}}) of the [[Kaiserliche Marine|German Imperial Navy]]. The ships were ordered for the 1912 to 1913 Naval Building Program of the German Imperial Navy as a reply to the [[Royal Navy]]'s three new {{sclass|Lion|battlecruiser|1}}s that had been launched a few years earlier. The preceding {{sclass|Moltke|battlecruiser|4}} and the incrementally improved {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}} represented the end of the evolution of Germany's first generation of battlecruisers. The ''Derfflinger'' class boasted considerable improvements, including a larger primary armament, all of which was mounted on the centerline, eliminating the restricted arc of the amidships turret. The ships were also larger than the preceding classes. However, the ''Derfflinger'' class used a similar propulsion system, and as a result of the increased displacement were slightly slower.

The class comprised three ships: {{SMS|Derfflinger||2}}, {{SMS|L<U+00FC>tzow||2}}, and {{SMS|Hindenburg||2}}. All three of the ships saw active service with the [[High Seas Fleet]] during [[World War I]]. ''Derfflinger'' was commissioned shortly after the outbreak of war, and was present at most of the naval actions in the North Sea, including the battles of [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Dogger Bank]] and [[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]]. ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' was commissioned in August 1915, and only participated in the [[Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft|raid on Yarmouth]] before being sunk at Jutland. ''Hindenburg'' was not commissioned into the fleet until May 1917, and as a result saw no major action. ''Derfflinger'' and ''Hindenburg'' were interned at [[Scapa Flow]] following the armistice in November 1918. While their fate was still unknown, Rear Admiral [[Ludwig von Reuter]], who was in command of the interned High Seas Fleet, [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|ordered the ships to be scuttled]] in an attempt to prevent their possible seizure by the [[Royal Navy]].

==Design==
The ''Derfflinger'' class battlecruisers were a result of the fourth and final [[German Naval Laws|Naval Law]], which was passed in 1912. Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] used public outcry over the British involvement in the [[Agadir Crisis]] of 1911 to pressure the [[Reichstag (institution)|Reichstag]] into appropriating additional funds to the Navy. The Fourth Naval Law secured funding for three new [[dreadnought]]s, two [[light cruiser]]s, and an increase of an additional 15,000 officers and men in the ranks of the Navy for 1912.<ref>Herwig, p. 77</ref> The three dreadnoughts secured in the bill were to become {{SMS|Derfflinger||2}}, {{SMS|L<U+00FC>tzow||2}}, and {{SMS|Hindenburg||2}}.<ref>Herwig, p. 81</ref> Design work on the first two ships began in October 1910 and continued until June 1911; ''Hindenburg'' was built to a slightly modified design, which was created between May and October 1912.<ref name="Groner56">Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 56</ref>

When design work began, the navy department was asked to submit new requirements to fix deficiencies found in the preceding battlecruiser classes, which primarily covered propulsion systems and the main armament. Previous battlecruisers used a four shaft arrangement for their engines; reducing the number to three would allow the new ships to equip a [[diesel engine]] on the central shaft. This would substantially increase the cruising range, and would ease the transfer of fuel and reduce the amount of crew members needed to operate the ships' machinery. The navy department also argued for an increase in the main battery guns, from 28-centimeter (11&nbsp;in) guns to more powerful 30.5&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in) weapons. This was due to the fact that the latest British battleships had thicker main belt armor, up to {{convert|300|mm|in}}. Since the German battlecruisers were intended to fight in the [[line of battle]], their armament needed to be sufficiently powerful to penetrate the armor of their British opponents. Weight increases were managed by reducing the number of guns, from 10 to 8&mdash;the increase in gun caliber added only 36&nbsp;tons to the ships' displacement. Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] argued against the increase in gun caliber, for he thought the 28&nbsp;cm gun was powerful enough.<ref name="Staff34">Staff, p. 34</ref>

A new construction technique was employed to save weight. Previous battlecruisers were built with a combination of transverse and longitudinal steel frames; the ''Derfflinger'' class ships dispensed with the transverse frames and used only the longitudinal ones. This enabled the ship to retain structural strength and a lower weight. As with all preceding capital ships, the outer hull spaces between the hull wall and the [[torpedo bulkhead]] were to be used for coal storage.<ref>Staff, pp. 34&ndash;35</ref>

On 1 September 1910, the design board chose the 30.5&nbsp;cm, to be mounted in four twin [[gun turret|turrets]] on the centerline of the ship. The armor layout was kept the same as in ''Seydlitz''. In the meantime, pressure from the British public and media had forced the British [[Parliament]] to step up ship building. Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] requested that the build time for the new battlecruisers be reduced to two years each, as opposed to three years. This proved unfeasible, because neither the armor or armament firms could supply the necessary materials according to an expedited schedule.<ref name="Staff34"/> 

===General characteristics===
[[Image:Derfflinger class battlecruiser - Jane's Fighting Ships, 1919 - Project Gutenberg etext 24797.png|thumb|right|<center>Plan and elevation view of the Derfflinger class, from Jane's ''Fighting Ships'' 1919</center>|alt=Design schematics for this type of ship; it carried two gun turrets on either end, with two large smoke stacks and two tall masts in between.]]
''Derfflinger'' and ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' were {{convert|210|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|210.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Length overall|long overall]]. ''Hindenburg'' was slightly longer, at {{convert|212.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} at the waterline and {{convert|212.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} overall. All three ships had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|29|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and a draft of between {{convert|9.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} forward and {{convert|9.57|m|ft|abbr=on}} aft. The first two ships were designed to [[Displacement (ship)|displace]] {{convert|26600|MT|lk=on}} with a standard load, and up to {{convert|31200|MT}} at combat weight. ''Hindenburg'' displaced slightly more, at {{convert|26947|MT}} standard and {{convert|31500|MT}} fully laden. The ships' [[hull (watercraft)|hulls]] were constructed from longitudinal steel frames, over which the outer hull plates were [[rivet]]ed. ''Derfflinger''{{'}}s hull contained 16 [[watertight compartment]]s, though ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' and ''Hindenburg'' had an additional seventeenth compartment. All three ships had a [[double bottom]] that ran for 65% of the length of the hull.<ref name="Groner56"/> This was a decrease from preceding German battlecruisers, which had a double bottom for at least 75% of the hull.<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 54&ndash;55</ref>

The ships were regarded as excellent sea boats by the German navy.<ref name="Groner57">Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 57</ref> The ''Derfflinger'' class ships were described as having had gentle motion, though they were "wet" at the [[casemate]] deck. The ships lost up to 65% speed with the twin rudders hard over, and heeled up to 11&nbsp;degrees. This was greater than any of the preceding battlecruiser designs, and as a result, anti-roll tanks were fitted to ''Derfflinger''.<ref group=Note>Anti-roll tanks were only fitted to ''Derfflinger'', because during the initial trials on the battlecruiser {{SMS|Von der Tann||2}}, the roll tanks were found to only reduce rolling by 33%. This was deemed to be an insufficient benefit to warrant the extra weight of the roll tanks. The roll tanks also required the removal of two of ''Derfflinger''{{'}}s secondary guns. See: Staff, p. 35</ref> The three ships had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|2.6|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The standard crew for one of the vessels was 44 officers and 1,068 men; when serving as the flagship for the [[I Scouting Group]], the ships carried an additional 14 officers and 62 men. The ''Derfflinger''s carried a number of smaller craft, including one picket boat, three barges, two [[Launch (boat)|launches]], two [[yawl]]s, and two [[dinghy|dinghies]].<ref name="Groner57"/>

===Machinery===
By the time construction work on ''Derfflinger'' began, it was determined that the diesel engine was not ready for use. Instead, the plan to use a three-shaft system was abandoned and the ships reverted to the standard four-shaft arrangement.<ref name="Staff34"/> Each of the three ships were equipped with two sets of marine-type [[steam turbine|turbines]]; each set drove a pair of 3-bladed [[propeller|screws]] that were {{convert|3.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter on ''Derfflinger'' and ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' and {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter on ''Hindenburg''.<ref name="Groner57"/> Each set consisted of a high- and low-pressure turbine&mdash;the high-pressure machines drove the outer shafts while the low-pressure turbines turned the inner pair.<ref>Staff, p. 37</ref> Steam was supplied to the turbines from 14 coal-fired marine-type double boilers and eight oil-fired marine-type double-ended boilers. Each ship was equipped with a pair of turbo-electric generators and a pair of diesel-electric generators that provided a total of 1,660&nbsp;[[kilowatt]]s at 220&nbsp;[[volt]]s. Each ship was equipped with two [[rudder]]s.<ref name="Groner57"/>

The engines for first two ships were designed to provide {{convert|63000|shp|lk=on}}, at 280&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute]]. This would have given the two ships a top speed of {{convert|26.5|kn|lk=on}}. However, during trials, ''Derfflinger''{{'}}s engines achieved {{convert|76634|shp}}, but a top speed of {{convert|25.5|kn}}. ''L<U+00FC>tzow''{{'}}s engines reached {{convert|80988|shp|abbr=on}} and a top speed of {{convert|26.4|kn}}. ''Hindenburg''{{'}}s power plant was rated at {{convert|72000|shp|abbr=on}} at 290&nbsp;rpm, for a top speed of {{convert|27|kn}}. On trials she reached {{convert|95777|shp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|26.6|kn}}. ''Derfflinger'' could carry {{convert|3500|MT|abbr=on}} of coal and {{convert|1000|MT|abbr=on}} of oil; at a cruising speed of {{convert|14|kn}}, she had a range of {{convert|5600|nmi|km|lk=on}}. ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' carried {{convert|3700|MT|abbr=on}} of coal and 1,000&nbsp;tons of oil, though she had no advantage in range over her [[sister ship|sister]] ''Derfflinger''. ''Hindenburg'' also stored 3,700&nbsp;tons of coal, as well as {{convert|1200|MT|abbr=on}} of oil; her range at 14&nbsp;knots was rated at {{convert|6100|nmi|km}}.<ref name="Groner56"/>

===Armament===
[[File:Derfflinger's fore turrets.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Derfflinger''{{'}}s forward gun turrets|alt=Two large gun turrets on a warship. Thick black smoke billows from the funnels.]]

The ''Derfflinger'' class ships were armed with eight [[30.5 cm SK L/50 gun|30.5&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in) SK L/50 guns]]<ref group=Note>In Imperial German Navy gun nomenclature, "SK" (''Schnellfeuerkanone'') denotes that the gun is quick firing, while the L/50 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/50 gun is 50 [[Caliber#Caliber as measurement of length|calibers]], meaning that the gun barrel is 50 times as long as it is in diameter.</ref> in four twin [[gun turret]]s, two forward of the main [[superstructure]] in a [[superfire|superfiring]] pair and two to the rear of the ship, in a similar arrangement. The guns were housed in Drh.L C/1912 mounts on the first two ships, and in Drh.L C/1913 mounts on ''Hindenburg''. The turrets were trained with electrical motors, while the guns were elevated hydraulically, up to 13.5&nbsp;degrees. The guns fired 405.5-kilogram (894 lb) [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing shells]] at a [[muzzle velocity]] of 855&nbsp;meters per second (2,805&nbsp;ft/s). At 13.5&nbsp;degrees, the shells could hit targets out to {{convert|18000|m|yd|abbr=on}}. The turrets were modified in 1916 to increase the elevation maximum to 16&nbsp;degrees. This correspondingly increased the range to {{convert|20400|m|yd|abbr=on}}. The ships carried 720 shells, or 90 per gun; each gun was supplied with 65 armor-piercing (AP) shells and 25 semi-AP shells for use against targets with less armor protection.<ref name="Staff36">Staff, p. 36</ref> The 30.5&nbsp;cm gun had a [[rate of fire]] of between 2&ndash;3 shells per minute, and was expected to fire 200 shells before replacement was necessary. The guns were also capable of firing 405.9&nbsp;kg (894.8&nbsp;lb) [[high explosive]] shells. The shells were loaded with two RP C/12 [[propellant]] charges: a main charge in a brass cartridge that weighed 91&nbsp;kg (201&nbsp;lb) and a fore charge in a silk bag that weighed 34.5&nbsp;kg (76&nbsp;lb).<ref name="Navweaps30.5">{{cite web| last = DiGiulian| first = Tony| title = Germany 30.5 cm/50 (12<U+2033>) SK L/50 | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_12-50_skc12.htm| publisher = Navweaps.com| date = 28 December 2008| accessdate = 24 July 2009}}</ref> The propellant magazines were located underneath the shell rooms for the two forward turrets as well as the rear superfiring turret; the arrangement was reversed for the rearmost turret.<ref name="Staff36"/>

The ships were designed to carry fourteen 15&nbsp;cm SK L/45 quick-firing guns, mounted in [[casemate]]s along the superstructure. Because ''Derfflinger'' had to be fitted with anti-roll tanks, two of the casemated guns had to be removed, to allow enough room in the hull. ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' and ''Hindenburg'' were equipped with the designed number of guns. Each gun was supplied with 160 rounds, and had a maximum range of {{convert|13500|m|yd|abbr=on}}, though this was later extended to {{convert|16800|m|yd|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Staff36"/> The guns had a sustained [[rate of fire]] of five to seven rounds per minute. The shells were 45.3&nbsp;kg (99.8&nbsp;lb), and were loaded with a 13.7&nbsp;kg (31.2&nbsp;lb) RPC/12 [[propellant]] charge in a brass cartridge. The guns fired at a [[muzzle velocity]] of 835&nbsp;meters per second (2,740&nbsp;ft/s). The guns were expected to fire around 1,400 shells before they needed to be replaced.<ref name="Navweaps15">{{cite web| last = DiGiulian| first = Tony| title = German 15 cm/45 (5.9<U+2033>) SK L/45| url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_59-45_skc16.htm| publisher = Navweaps.com| date = 06 July 2007| accessdate = 24 July 2009}}</ref>

The three ships carried a variety of 8.8&nbsp;cm SK L/45 guns in a number of different configurations. The ''Derfflinger'' class ships were initially equipped with eight of these weapons, all in single mounts; four were placed in the forward superstructure and four in the aft superstructure. The ships also carried four 8.8&nbsp;cm Flak L/45 anti-aircraft guns, which were emplaced around the forward funnel, with the exception of ''L<U+00FC>tzow'', which carried the Flak guns around the rear funnel. After 1916, the four 8.8&nbsp;cm guns in the forward superstructure were removed.<ref name="Staff36"/> The Flak guns were emplaced in MPL C/13 mountings, which allowed depression to <U+2212>10&nbsp;degrees and elevation to 70&nbsp;degrees. These guns fired 9&nbsp;kg (19.8&nbsp;lb) shells, and had an effective ceiling of {{convert|9150|m|ft|abbr=on}} at 70&nbsp;degrees.<ref name="Navweaps8.8">{{cite web| last = DiGiulian| first = Tony| title = German 8.8 cm/45 (3.46<U+2033>) SK L/45, 8.8 cm/45 (3.46<U+2033>) Tbts KL/45, 8.8 cm/45 (3.46<U+2033>) Flak L/45| url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_88mm-45_skc13.htm| publisher = Navweaps.com| date = 16 April 2009| accessdate = 24 July 2009}}</ref>

The ships were also armed with submerged torpedo tubes in their hulls. ''Derfflinger'' was equipped with four 50&nbsp;cm tubes;  the later ships were armed with more powerful 60&nbsp;cm weapons.<ref name="Staff36"/> The tubes were arranged with one in the bow, one in the stern, and two on the broadside.<ref name="Groner57"/> ''Derfflinger''{{'}}s 50&nbsp;cm torpedoes were the G7 type, 7.02&nbsp;m (276&nbsp;in) long and armed with a 195&nbsp;kg (430&nbsp;lb) [[Hexanite]] warhead. The torpedo had a range of 4,000&nbsp;m (4,370&nbsp;yd) when set at a speed of 37&nbsp;knots, and up to 9,300&nbsp;m (10,170&nbsp;yd) at 27 knots. The 60&nbsp;cm torpedoes were the H8 type, which were 8&nbsp;m long and carried a 210&nbsp;kg (463&nbsp;lb) Hexanite warhead. The torpedoes had a range of 6,000&nbsp;m (6,550&nbsp;yd) when set at a speed of 36&nbsp;knots; at a reduced speed of 30&nbsp;knots, the range increased significantly to 14,000&nbsp;m
(15,310&nbsp;yd).<ref name="Navweapstorp">{{cite web| last = DiGiulian| first = Tony| title = German Torpedoes Pre-World War II | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WTGER_PreWWII.htm| publisher = Navweaps.com| date = 21 April 2007| accessdate = 24 July 2009}}</ref>

===Armor===
The ''Derfflinger'' class ships were protected with [[Krupp]] steel armor, as was the standard for German warships of the period. They had an [[armor belt]] that was {{convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick in the central citadel of the ship, where the most important parts of the ship were located. This included the ammunition magazines and the machinery spaces. The belt was reduced in less critical areas, to {{convert|120|mm|in|abbr=on}} forward and {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} aft. The belt tapered down to {{convert|30|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the [[Bow (ship)|bow]], though the [[stern]] was not protected by armor at all. A {{convert|45|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick [[torpedo bulkhead]] ran the length of the hull, several meters behind the main belt. The main armored deck ranged in thickness from 30&nbsp;mm thick in less important areas, to {{convert|80|mm|in|abbr=on}} in the sections that covered the more critical areas of the ship.<ref name="Groner56"/>

The forward [[conning tower]] was protected with heavy armor: the sides were 300&nbsp;mm thick and the roof was {{convert|130|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick. The rear conning tower was less well armored; its sides were only {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick and the roof was covered with {{convert|50|mm|in|abbr=on}} of armor plate. The main battery gun turrets were also heavily armored: the turret sides were {{convert|270|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick and the roofs were {{convert|110|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick. On ''Hindenburg'', the thickness of the turret roofs was increased to {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The 15&nbsp;cm guns had 150&nbsp;mm-worth of armor plating in the casemates; the guns themselves had {{convert|70|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick shields to protect their crews from shell splinters.<ref name="Groner56"/>

Of the three ships in its class, only ''Derfflinger'' was ordered as an addition to the fleet, under the provisional name "K". The other two ships were to intended to replace obsolete vessels; ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' was ordered as ''Ersatz Kaiserin Augusta'' for the elderly [[protected cruiser]] {{SMS|Kaiserin Augusta||2}} and the contract for ''Hindenburg'' was issued under the provisional name ''Ersatz Hertha'', to replace the protected cruiser {{SMS|Hertha||2}}.<ref name="Groner56"/>

''Derfflinger'' was constructed at [[Blohm und Voss]] in Hamburg under construction number 213. She was the least expensive of the three ships, at a cost of 56 million [[German gold mark|gold marks]].<ref name="Groner57"/> The ship was ready to be launched on 14 June 1913, but during the ceremony, one of the wooden sledges upon which the hull rested became jammed. It was not until nearly a month later, on 12 July, that she actually entered the water.<ref name="Staff39"/> She was commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] on 1 September 1914, shortly after the outbreak of [[World War I]]. ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' was built at the [[Schichau Seebeckwerft|Schichau]] dockyard in Danzig under construction number 885, at the cost of 58&nbsp;million gold marks. The ship was launched on 29 November 1913, and after lengthy trials, commissioned on 8 August 1915. ''Hindenburg'', the final member of the class, was built at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven|Imperial Dockyard]] in [[Wilhelmshaven]], under construction number 34. The ship was built at a cost of 59&nbsp;million gold marks, the most expensive of the three vessels. She was launched on 1 August 1915 and commissioned on 10 May 1917.<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 56&ndash;57</ref>

==Units==
===SMS ''Derfflinger''===
Named after [[Georg von Derfflinger]], a German field marshal during the [[Thirty Years War]], {{SMS|Derfflinger||2}} was commissioned on 1 September 1914. A dockyard crew transferred the ship from [[Hamburg]] to [[Kiel]], via the [[Skagen]]. The ship was assigned to the [[I Scouting Group]] at the end of October. Damage to the ship's turbines sustained during [[Sea trial|trials]] prevented the ship from seeing active service until 16 November. On 15 December, the ship took part in the [[raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby]]. She was also present during the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|battle of Dogger Bank]] on 24 January 1915. The ship was hit once by a 13.5-inch shell from one of the British battlecruisers; in response, she heavily damaged {{HMS|Lion|1910|6}}. Repair work was completed by 16 February, but ''Derfflinger''{{'}}s starboard turbine was accidentally damaged on 28 June, and the ship was again in the dockyard until August. On 24 April 1916, ''Derfflinger'' took part in the [[Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft|bombardment of Yarmouth]].<ref name="Staff39">Staff, p. 39</ref>

[[Image:HMS Queen Mary Jutland.jpg|thumb|right|''Queen Mary''{{'}}s magazines detonate|alt=A large warship is almost completely obscured by a huge column of smoke.]]
On 31 May, ''Derfflinger'' was heavily engaged during the [[battle of Jutland]], as the second ship in the German battlecruiser line. She sustained 21 major hits during the battle, but dealt considerable damage to the British battlecruiser force as well. At 16:26, {{HMS|Queen Mary}} sank after a magazine explosion that tore the ship apart; she had been targeted with a hail of heavy-caliber gunfire from ''Derfflinger'' and ''Seydlitz''. Two hours later, at 18:30, {{HMS|Invincible|1907|6}} suffered a similar fate, though ''Derfflinger'' was assisted by her sister ''L<U+00FC>tzow''. During the engagement, ''Derfflinger'' had both of her rear turrets knocked out by British gunfire. Her crew suffered 157 men killed and 26 wounded, which was the highest casualty figure for any ship not sunk. The resilience of the vessel earned her the nickname "Iron Dog" from her British adversaries.<ref name="Staff39"/> Repair work lasted until 15 October, during which the ship had her pole mast removed and replaced with a tripod mast. The ship conducted training operations until November, at which point she returned to active duty with the fleet.<ref>Staff, pp. 39&ndash;40</ref>

Following the German capitulation in November 1918, ''Derfflinger'' was interned with a significant portion of the [[High Seas Fleet]] in [[Scapa Flow]]. On 21 June 1919, with the guard ships of the Royal Navy out on maneuvers, Rear Admiral [[Ludwig von Reuter]] ordered that the fleet be scuttled.<ref group=Note>The Armistice was scheduled to expire at noon on 21 June 1919; however, by the 20th, it had been extended to 23 June. There is some contention as to whether von Reuter was aware of this. Admiral Fremantle, the commander of the British fleet based in Scapa, stated that he informed von Reuter on the evening of the 20th, though von Reuter claims he was unaware of the development. For Fremantle's claim, see Bennett, p. 307. For von Reuter's statement, see Herwig, p. 256</ref> The resulting [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|scuttling of the German fleet]] saw some 66 vessels of various types sunk.<ref>Herwig, p. 256</ref> Among those was ''Derfflinger'', which sank at 14:45. The ship was raised in 1939 to be broken up for scrap metal, but the outbreak of [[World War II]] intervened. The ship, which remained [[capsize]]d, was anchored off the island of [[Risa (island)|Risa]] until 1946, at which point she was sent to [[HMNB Clyde|Faslane Port]], where she was broken up. The ship's bell was delivered to the German [[German Navy|Federal Navy]] on 30 August 1965.<ref name="Groner57"/>

===SMS ''L<U+00FC>tzow''===
{{SMS|L<U+00FC>tzow||2}} was named after [[Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von L<U+00FC>tzow]], a Prussian lieutenant-general who fought during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The ship was commissioned on 8 August 1915, and then underwent trials. On 25 October, while still running sea trials, ''L<U+00FC>tzow''{{'}}s port low pressure turbine were severely damaged. She was sent to Kiel for repairs, which lasted until late January 1916. The ship went on additional trials that lasted until 19 February. ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' was by then fully operational, and assigned to the I&nbsp;Scouting Group on 20 March 1916. She took part in two fleet advances, on 25 March and 21&ndash;22 April, without any major incidents. The following day, on 23 April, ''L<U+00FC>tzow'', along with her sister ''Derfflinger'' and the battlecruisers ''Seydlitz'', {{SMS|Moltke|1910|2}}, and {{SMS|Von der Tann||2}}, bombarded Yarmouth. While en route to the target,  Vice Admiral [[Franz von Hipper]]'s flagship ''Seydlitz'' was heavily damaged by mines. As a result, ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' was transferred to the role of squadron flagship. During the operation, the German battlecruisers encountered British light forces, and a running battle ensued. ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' engaged the light cruiser {{HMS|Conquest|1915|6}} and hit her several times.<ref>Staff, p. 40</ref>

At the Battle of Jutland, she was the first ship in the German line, and Hipper's flagship. Shortly after the start of the battlecruiser action, ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' hit her opponent {{HMS|Lion|1910|6}} several times; one hit knocked out ''Lion''{{'}}s "Q" turret, and the resulting magazine fire nearly destroyed the ship.<ref group=Note>Only the quick action of Major [[Francis Harvey]], who despite being mortally wounded ordered the magazine be flooded, prevented a flash fire.</ref> Shortly after 19:00, the armored cruisers {{HMS|Defence||2}} and {{HMS|Warrior||2}} inadvertently ran into the German line; ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' opened fire immediately, followed by several German [[dreadnought]]s. In a hail of shells, ''Defence''{{'}}s ammunition magazines detonated and the ship was sunk.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 138&ndash;140</ref> At around the same time, the fresh battlecruisers of the III Battlecruiser Squadron engaged their German opposites. Between 19:26 and 19:34, ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' sustained four 12-inch shell hits in her bow from the British battlecruisers; these eventually proved to be fatal. Despite this, at 19:30, ''L<U+00FC>tzow'', along with her sister ''Derfflinger'', destroyed the battlecruiser ''Invincible''. By 20:15, ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' had been hit five more times, including hits on her two forward turrets.<ref name="Staff41">Staff, p. 41</ref>

By 22:15, ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' had shipped nearly 2,400&nbsp;tons of water, and the ship was dangerously down by the bows. After midnight, attempts were made to steer the ship in reverse. This however failed when the bow became submerged enough to bring the stern out of the water; by 02:20, the screws and both rudders were coming out of the water and the ship was no longer able to steer. The order to abandon ship was given, and at 02:47, ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' was sunk by the torpedo boat {{SMS|G38||2}}. The ship was lost because the flooding in the bow could not be controlled; the forward pump system failed and the central system could not keep up with the rising water.<ref name="Staff41"/> The crew was picked up by four torpedo boats that had been escorting the crippled battlecruiser; during the battle the ship suffered 116 men killed.<ref name="Staff42">Staff, p. 42</ref>

===SMS ''Hindenburg''===

{{SMS|Hindenburg||2}} was the last battlecruiser completed for the Imperial German Navy, and as such had a very short career. She was commissioned 10 May 1917, and was fully operational by 20 October 1917, albeit too late to see any major action in World War I. On 17 November ''Hindenburg'' and ''Moltke'', along with the light cruisers of the II&nbsp;Scouting Group, were acting as distant support for German minesweepers off the German coast when they were attacked by British battlecruisers. However, the raid was brief; by the time ''Hindenburg'' and ''Moltke'' arrived on the scene, the British ships had broken off the attack and withdrawn. Six days later, ''Hindenburg'' replaced ''Seydlitz'' as flagship of the I&nbsp;Scouting Group.<ref group=Note>''Seydlitz'' had resumed her duties as squadron flagship after the loss of ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' at Jutland.</ref> On 23 April 1918, the ship took part in an abortive fleet advance into the North Sea that attempted to intercept an Allied convoy. ''Moltke'' sustained mechanical damage while en route, and as a result, Vice Admiral Hipper decided to cancel the operation. On 11 August, Hipper was promoted to Admiral and given command of the entire High Seas Fleet. Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter replaced Hipper as the commander of the I&nbsp;Scouting Group; he raised his flag on ''Hindenburg'' the following day.<ref name="Staff42"/>

''Hindenburg'' was interned at Scapa Flow, along with her sister ''Derfflinger'' and the rest of the German battlecruisers. She was scuttled on 21 June 1919, and sank at 17:00. Several unsuccessful attempts to raise her were made; on 23 July 1930 the ship was finally raised. From 1930 to 1932 she was scrapped at [[Rosyth]]. Her bell was presented to the German Federal Navy on 28 May 1959.<ref name="Groner57"/>
