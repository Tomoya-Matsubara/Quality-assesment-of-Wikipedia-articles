'''''Symphony Hour''''' is a 1942 American animated [[short film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] and released by [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]]. The cartoon depicts [[Mickey Mouse]] conducting a symphony orchestra sponsored by [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]]. The film was directed by [[Riley Thomson]] and features music adapted from the "[[Light Cavalry Overture]]" by [[Franz von Supp<U+00E9>]]. The voice cast includes [[Walt Disney]] as Mickey, [[Billy Bletcher]] as Pete, and John McLeish as a radio announcer.

The film marked the last theatrical appearance of Horace Horsecollar, Clarabelle Cow, and Clara Cluck for over 40 years, finally reappearing in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' (1983). ''Symphony Hour'' is also the last time that Mickey appeared with either Donald Duck or Goofy in a theatrical film for the same length of time.<ref>{{imdb title|0035404}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/3917-Symphony_Hour.html ''Symphony Hour''] at the [[Big Cartoon DataBase]]</ref><ref>[http://www.disneyshorts.org/shorts.aspx?shortID=342''Symphony Hour''] on The Encyclopedia of Animated Disney Shorts</ref>

''Symphony Hour'' bears similarities with the 1935 film ''[[The Band Concert]]''. Leonard Maltin called this short a "[[Spike Jones]] version of ''The Band Concert''".<ref>"[[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave Three#Mickey Mouse in Living Color, Volume Two|Mickey Mouse in Living Color, Volume Two]]"</ref>

==Plot==
Mickey leads a [[radio orchestra]] who performs the [[Light Cavalry Overture]] (by [[Franz von Supp<U+00E9>]]). The sponsor ([[Pete (Disney)|Pegleg Pete]] as Mr. Sylvester Macaroni) loves the rehearsal, but come the actual performance, [[Goofy]] drops all the instruments under an elevator, destroying the instruments' sounds. Sylvester Macaroni hates it, but suddenly lightens up when he realises the audience loves it anyway. [[Clara Cluck]] is in the orchestra in the beginning "rehearsal" sequences but not in the actual performance at the end. Other characters appearing in this short are [[Donald Duck]], [[Clarabelle Cow]] and [[Horace Horsecollar]].

At one stage, Donald is so fed up with the [[wikt:chaos|chaos]] caused by the wrecked instruments that he packs his things and leaves. Mickey, determined to carry on come what may, points a gun at Donald's head to get him back into playing. This scene is missing in some versions of the short.
