'''HMS ''Harvester''''' was a [[G and H class destroyer|H-class]] [[destroyer]] originally ordered by the [[Brazilian Navy]] with the name ''Jurua'' in the late 1930s, but was bought by the [[Royal Navy]] after the beginning of [[World War II]] in September 1939. Almost immediately after [[Ship commissioning|commissioning]], in May 1940, the ship began [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuating Allied troops from Dunkirk]] and other locations in France. Afterwards she was assigned to the [[Western Approaches Command]] for convoy escort duties. ''Harvester'' and another destroyer sank a German submarine in October. She was briefly assigned to [[Force H]] in 1941, but her anti-aircraft armament was deemed too weak and she was transferred to the [[Newfoundland Escort Force]] the next month for escort duties in the North Atlantic. The ship was returned to the Western Approaches Command in October 1941 and was converted to an [[escort destroyer]] in early 1942. ''Harvester'' was torpedoed and sunk in March 1943 by a German submarine after having rammed and sunk another submarine the previous day while escorting [[Convoy HX 228]].

==Description==
''Harvester'' displaced {{convert|1350|LT|t}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard]] load and {{convert|1883|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|323|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|33|ft|m|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft|5|in|m|1}}. She was powered by [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, driving two shafts, which developed a total of {{convert|34000|shp|lk=in}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|36|kn|lk=in}}. Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum [[water-tube boiler]]s. ''Harvester'' carried a maximum of {{convert|470|LT|t}} of fuel oil, giving her a range of {{convert|5530|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|15|kn}}.<ref name=w78>Whitley, p. 109</ref> The ship's complement was 152 officers and men.<ref name=l3>Lenton, p. 163</ref>

The vessel was designed for four 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[4.7 inch QF Mark XII|4.7-inch Mk IX guns]] in single mounts, designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear, but 'Y' gun was removed to compensate for the additional depth charges added. For [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) defence, ''Harvester'' had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the [[Vickers .50 machine gun|0.5&nbsp;inch Vickers Mark III]] [[machine gun]]. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple [[torpedo tube]] mounts for [[British 21 inch torpedo|{{convert|21|in|adj=on|0}}]] torpedoes.<ref name=w78/> One [[depth charge]] rail and two throwers were originally fitted, but this was increased to three sets of rails and eight throwers while [[fitting-out]]. The ship's load of depth charges was increased from 20 to 110 as well.<ref>English, p. 141</ref><ref>Friedman, p. 226</ref>

===Wartime modifications===
''Harvester'' had her rear torpedo tubes replaced by a [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12-pounder]] AA gun after the [[evacuation of Dunkirk]] in 1940, but it is not known exactly when this modification was made. During her 1942 conversion to an escort destroyer, the ship's short-range AA armament had been augmented by two [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20&nbsp;mm]] guns on the wings of the ship's [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. The .50-calibre machine gun mounts were replaced by a pair of Oerlikons later. 'A' gun was replaced by a [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] anti-submarine [[spigot mortar]]. The ship's [[List of British ordnance terms#DCT|director-control tower]] and [[rangefinder]] above the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] were removed in exchange for a [[Type 271 radar|Type 271]] target indication radar. A [[Type 286 radar|Type 286]] short-range surface search radar was probably also fitted mid-way through the war. The ship also received a [[HF/DF]] [[radio direction finder]] mounted on a pole [[mainmast]].<ref name=l3/>

==Service==
''Jurua'' was ordered by Brazil on 6 December 1937 from [[Vickers-Armstrongs]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]]. The ship was [[Keel|laid down]] on 3 June 1938 and she was purchased by the British on 5 September and renamed HMS ''Handy''. The ship was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 29 September 1939 and renamed ''Harvester'' in January 1940 as her original name was thought too liable to be confused with {{HMS|Hardy|1936|2}}. ''Harvester'' was commissioned on 23 May and briefly [[Glossary of nautical terms#W|worked up]] at [[Portland Harbour]] before she was assigned to the 9th Destroyer Flotilla.<ref name=e7>English, p. 127</ref>

The ship joined the Dunkirk evacuation on 29 May and returned 272 men to Dover during the day. However, the situation at Dunkirk soon became too dangerous to risk the larger and more modern destroyers, so ''Harvester'' made no attempt to evacuate any troops during daylight hours on 30 May. This decision was rescinded during the day on 30 May and the ship sailed for Dunkirk on the night of 30/31 May. En route she was narrowly missed by two torpedoes, but she rescued 1341 men in two trips on 31 May and an additional 576 on 1 June.<ref>Wisner, pp. 20, 25, 87</ref> ''Harvester'' was lightly damaged by [[strafing]] German aircraft that same day and required repairs that were made at [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]]. On 9 June the ship was ordered to [[Le Havre]], France, to evacuate British troops, but none were to be found. She loaded 78 men at [[Saint-Valery-en-Caux]] on 11 June. Later in the month she escorted ships evacuating refugees and troops from [[Saint-Nazaire]] and [[St. Jean de Luz]] ([[Operation Ariel]]).<ref>Wisner, pp. 38, 48, 128, 146</ref>

From July to September, ''Harvester'' was assigned to convoy escort duties with the [[Western Approaches Command]] and she rescued 90 survivors from the [[armed merchant cruiser]] ''Dunvegan Castle'' in late August. The ship, together with five other destroyers of the 9th Flotilla, was assigned to [[Plymouth Command]] for anti-invasion duties between 8 and 18 September before returning to her role as an escort vessel. On 30 October, with help from her [[sister ship|sister]] {{HMS|Highlander|H44|2}}, she sank the {{GS|U-32|1937|6}}. ''Harvester'' rescued 19 survivors from {{MV|Silverpine}} on 5 December and 131 survivors from the [[Armed boarding steamer|Armed Boarding Vessel]] ''Crispin'' on 3 February 1941. She rescued four survivors from a [[Royal Air Force]] [[Armstrong Whitworth Whitley]] bomber four days later.<ref>English, pp. 127, 132</ref>

The ship was refitted at Barrow between 18 March and 18 April and then was assigned to [[Force H]] in Gibraltar where she escorted ships during [[Malta Convoys#May 1941&nbsp;<U+2013> Operations Tiger and Splice|Operations Tiger and Splice]] in May. ''Harvester'' was transferred to the [[Newfoundland Escort Force]] in June as her anti-aircraft capability was believed by Admiral [[James Somerville]] to be too weak. She was assigned to the 14th [[Escort Group (naval)|Escort Group]] upon her arrival at [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] on 1 July. The ship was transferred back to the Western Approaches Command three months later<ref>English, pp. 127<U+2013>28</ref> and assigned to the 9th Escort Group.<ref>Rohwer, p. 104</ref> ''Harvester'' was converted to an escort destroyer during a lengthy refit at [[Dundee]], Scotland, from 30 January 1942 to 16 April. She conducted [[sea trial]]s of her Type 271 radar during May and then resumed her escort duties in the North Atlantic.<ref name=e8>English, p. 128</ref>

The ship was refitted at [[Liverpool]] between 12 December and 11 February 1943. Whilst defending Convoy HX 228 on 3 March, ''Harvester'' forced {{GS|U-444||2}} to the surface and then [[Ramming|rammed]] it. She was badly damaged by the ramming, but she rescued five survivors after the submarine sank.<ref name=e8/> The next day, ''Harvester'' was torpedoed by {{GS|U-432||2}} and broke in half.<ref name=e8/> Nine officers and 136 ratings were lost, but the {{ship|French corvette|Aconit}} rammed and sank U-432 herself and then rescued ''Harvester''{{'}}s few survivors.<ref name=e8/>
