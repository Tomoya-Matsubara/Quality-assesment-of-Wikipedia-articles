'''WASN''' (1500 [[AM broadcasting|AM]]) is a [[radio station]]  broadcasting a news/talk format. Licensed to [[Youngstown, Ohio]], USA, the station serves the Youngstown-Warren area.  The station is currently owned by Bernard Ohio LLC.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?call=WASN |title=WASN Facility Record |work=United States [[Federal Communications Commission]], audio division }}</ref>

Since January 1, 2010, WASN has carried an urban-focused talk format. In addition to Syndication One hosts [[Warren Ballentine]], [[Rev. Al Sharpton]] and [[Michael Baisden]], WASN carries a local morning show, "Morning Coffee with Tracey and Friends." Previous formats have included gospel music and Spanish-language programming. The station now streams on a 24-hour basis, owing to WASN's daytime-only status (to protect [[WFED]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]).

WASN's sister station, [[WGFT]]-AM 1330, carries a conservative talk radio format.
