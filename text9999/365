'''Hylton Castle''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8>h<U+026A>ltn}} ''hil-tn'') is a ruined stone [[castle]] in the [[North Hylton]] area of [[Sunderland]], [[Tyne and Wear]], [[England]]. Originally built from wood by the [[Baron Hylton|Hilton (later Hylton) family]] shortly after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] in 1066, it was later rebuilt in stone in the late 14th to early 15th century.<ref name="Whittaker83">Whittaker, p.83</ref> The castle underwent major changes to its interior and exterior in the 18th century and it remained the principal seat of the Hylton family until the death of the last "baron" in 1746.<ref name="Fry">Fry, p.246</ref> It was then [[Gothic architecture|Gothicised]] but neglected until 1812, when it was revitalised by a new owner. Standing empty again until the 1840s, it was briefly used as a school until it was purchased again in 1862. The site passed to a local coal company in the early 20th century and was taken over by the [[state]] in 1950.

One of the castle's main features, is the [[heraldry|heraldic]] devices found mainly on the west [[fa<U+00E7>ade]], which have been retained from the castle's original construction. They depict the [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] belonging to local gentry and peers of the late 14th to early 15th centuries and provide an approximate date of the castle's reconstruction from wood to stone.

Today, the castle is owned by [[English Heritage]], a [[Non-Departmental Public Body]] which manages the historical environment of England. The surrounding parkland is maintained by a community organisation.<ref name="FHD">{{cite web|url=http://www.hyltoncastle.com/ |title=History |publisher=Friends of Hylton Dene |accessdate=2008-05-25}}</ref> The castle and its chapel are protected as a Grade I [[listed building]] and a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]]. As of 2008, a survey is being carried out to determine the future of the site.<ref name="HCF">{{cite web|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/Hylton-Castle39s-future--you.4000449.jp |title=Hylton Castle's future - you decide |publisher=[[Sunderland Echo]] |date=2008-04-21 |accessdate=2008-05-28}}</ref>

==History==
===Early history===
The Hylton family had been settled in England since the reign of [[Athelstan of England|King Athelstan]] (c.895&ndash;939).<ref>Sykes, p.9</ref><ref name="Timbs&Gunn283">Timbs & Gunn, p.283</ref> At this time, Adam de Hylton gave to the [[Hartlepool Abbey|monastery of Hartlepool]] a [[pyx]] or [[crucifix]], weighing {{convert|25|oz|g|lk=on}} in [[silver]] and [[blazon|emblazoned]] with his [[coat of arms]] &ndash; [[argent]], two bars [[azure]].<ref name="Timbs&Gunn283"/><ref>Sykes, p.9</ref> On the arrival of William the Conqueror, Lancelot de Hilton and his two sons, Robert and Henry, joined the Conqueror's forces, but Lancelot was killed at [[Faversham]] during William's advance to [[London]].<ref name="Timbs&Gunn283"/> In gratitude, the king granted the eldest son, Henry, a large tract of land on the banks of the [[River Wear]].<ref name="Timbs&Gunn283"/>

The first castle on the site, built by Henry de Hilton in about 1072, was likely to have been built of wood. It was subsequently re-built in stone by Sir William Hylton (1376&ndash;1435) as a four storey, [[gatehouse]]-style, fortified [[manor house]], similar in design to [[Lumley Castle|Lumley]] and [[Raby Castle|Raby]].<ref name="Whittaker83"/><ref name="Billings47">Billings, p.47</ref> Although called a gatehouse, it belongs to a type of small, late 14th century castle, similar to [[Old Wardour Castle|Old Wardour]], [[Bywell Castle|Bywell]] and [[Nunney Castle|Nunney]] castles.<ref name="Pevsner471">Pevsner, p.471</ref> The castle was first mentioned in a household inventory taken in 1448, as "a gatehouse constructed of stone" and although no construction details survive, it is believed the stone castle was built sometime between 1390 and the early 1400s, due to the coat of arms featured above the west entrance (see [[Hylton Castle#Heraldry|Heraldry]] below).<ref name="Pevsner470">Pevsner, p.470</ref><ref name="HCD">{{cite web|url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/libraries/Leaflets/Hyltoncastle.pdf |title=Hylton Castle & Dene |publisher=Sunderland Public Libraries Service |accessdate=2008-05-25}}</ref> It has been suggested that Sir William intended to erect a larger castle in addition to the gatehouse, but abandoned his plan.<ref name="Pettifer30">Pettifer, p.30</ref>

The household inventory taken on Sir William's death in 1435 mentions, in addition to the castle, a hall, four chambers, two barns, a kitchen, and the chapel, indicating the existence of other buildings on the site at that time.<ref name="HCD">{{cite web|url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/libraries/Leaflets/Hyltoncastle.pdf |title=Hylton Castle & Dene |publisher=Sunderland Public Libraries Service |accessdate=2008-05-25}}</ref> Apart from the castle and chapel, the other buildings were probably all of timber.<ref name="Pevsner470"/> In 1559, the gatehouse featured in another household inventory as the "Tower", when floors and [[gallery|galleries]] were inserted to subdivide the [[great hall]].<ref name="HCD"/><ref name="Pevsner471"/>

The eccentric [[Henry Hylton, de jure 12th Baron Hylton|Henry Hylton, ''de jure'' 12th Baron Hylton]] left the castle to the [[City of London Corporation]] on his death in 1641, to be used for charitable purposes for ninety-nine years.<ref name="Surtees">{{cite web|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M_S10M8ze9MC&pg=RA2-PA234&lpg=RA2-PA234&dq=Hylton+writ+of+summons&source=web&ots=NDJIeh8Zft&sig=3mHBIg4yVo8nThb3n774Sqrz3wE&hl=en#PRA2-PA234,M1 |title=The Gentlemen's Magazine &mdash; Review &ndash; Surtees's ''History of Durham'', March 1821, p.234}}</ref> It was returned to the family after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], to Henry's nephew, John Hylton, ''de jure'' 15th Baron Hylton.<ref name="Surtees"/><ref name="FHD"/>

===18th century===
[[Image:Hylton Castle - Buck 1728.png|thumb|right|250px|Hylton Castle and St Catherine's Chapel - Samuel and Nathaniel Buck, 1728]]
Early in the 18th century, John Hylton (died 1712), the second son of Henry Hylton, ''de jure'' 16th Baron Hylton, gutted the interior to form a three-storeyed block (one room on each floor).<ref name="Pevsner471"/> He also inserted large, alternating, [[pediment]]ed [[sash windows]] in the [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style]] and added a three-storeyed north wing to the castle (as seen in Bucks' engraving of 1728).<ref name="Pevsner471"/> A doorway to the new wing was added and approached by a [[semicircle|semi-circular]] staircase. Above the doorway was a coat of arms, believed to be the one created to commemorate the marriage between John Hylton and his wife, Dorothy Musgrave. It is now located above the doorway to ''The Golden Lion Inn'' at [[South Hylton]], on the opposite side of the River Wear.<ref name="Meadows&Waterson42">Meadows & Waterson, p.42</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/Pages/ListedBuildings/lbbuildingdetails.asp?Id=920-1/3/281&keyword=golden%20lion&Ownership=&Address3=&Grade= |title=Listed Buildings - Number:920-1/3/281 |publisher=Sunderland City Council |accessdate=2008-05-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandspastforeveryone.org.uk/Counties/Durham/Projects/OriginsOfSunderland/Items/The_Hilton_family/assetdetails/1100?Session/@id=D_5EUYTvIIknwwNyDeX8K6 |title=Doorway of the Golden Lion, South Hylton |publisher=England's Past for Everyone |accessdate=2008-05-31}}</ref>

After 1728, Hylton's second son, [[John Hylton, de jure 18th Baron Hylton|John Hylton, ''de jure'' 18th Baron Hylton]] added a complementary south wing (its [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] wall still extant), [[crenellation]]s to both wings and removed the door on the north wing.<ref name="Pettifer30"/><ref name="Meadows&Waterson42"/> He also changed the circular [[bartizan]] on the north end of the west front, to an [[octagon]]al [[turret]] and removed the [[portcullis]] from the west entrance.<ref name="HCD"/>

When the 18th and last "baron" died without male [[heir]]s in 1746, the castle passed to his nephew, [[Musgrave Baronets|Sir Richard Musgrave, Bt]], who took the name of Hylton. It was sold by an [[Act of Parliament]] in 1755.<ref name="FHD"/><ref name="HCD"/> The new owner was to be a Mr. Wogan who returned from the [[East Indies]] to buy the castle for [[GBP|<U+00A3>]]30,550 (<U+00A3>3.7 million in 2007), but the sale never went through.<ref name="Sykes220">Sykes, p.220</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Purchasing Power of British Pounds from 1264 to 2007|url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk/?redirurl=calculators/ppoweruk/|accessdate=2008-07-12}}</ref> It was instead bought by Lady Bowes, the widow of [[George Bowes|Sir George Bowes]] of Streatlam and [[Gibside]] in [[County Durham]].<ref name="Billings47"/><ref name="Sykes220"/> No record of her, or any of her family, ever taking up residence exists and the castle later passed to her grandson, [[John Bowes, 10th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne]].<ref name="Billings47"/><ref>{{cite web |title=
Mary Eleanor Bowes |url=http://www.sunnisidelocalhistorysociety.co.uk/eleanor.html |publisher=Sunniside Local History Society |accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> At this time, a [[stucco]] decoration (long since disappeared) to the [[wine room|wine]] and [[drawing room]]s was added by Pietro La Francini, who worked for [[Daniel Garrett]] (who had worked for Lady Bowes on [[Gibside Banqueting House]]).<ref name="Pevsner471"/> [[William Howitt]]'s ''Visits to Remarkable Places'' (1842) notes the rooms had "stuccoed ceilings, with figures, busts on the walls, and one large scene which seemed to be Venus and Cupid, Apollo fiddling to the gods, Minerva in her helmet, and an old king".<ref name="Meadows&Waterson43">Meadows & Waterson, p.43</ref> Garrett probably designed the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[porch]] installed in the west entrance and the Gothic screen and single-storey, bow-fronted rooms installed to close off the east entrance.<ref name="Whittaker83"/><ref name="Pevsner471"/><ref name="Meadows&Waterson43"/>

===19th century===

[[Image:Hylton Castle c.1800-1829.PNG|thumb|right|Hylton Castle and St Catherine's Chapel (again on the left) &ndash; unknown artist, c.&nbsp;1800&ndash;1829]]
After a long period of remaining empty, the castle slowly began to decay, until in 1812, when Simon Temple, a local businessman, leased the castle from the Strathmores and made it habitable.<ref name="Whittaker83"/> He re-roofed the chapel (allowing it to be used for public worship again), added [[battlement]]s to the wings and cultivated the gardens.<ref name="Whittaker83"/><ref name="Meadows&Waterson43"/> However, his failed business ventures prevented him from completing his work, and in 1819 the castle was bought and lived in by a Mr. Thomas Wade.<ref name="Whittaker83"/><ref name="Meadows&Waterson43"/>

By 1834, the castle was unoccupied again.<ref name="Meadows&Waterson43"/> In 1840, an advert was placed in the ''Newcastle Courant'' by Revd. John Wood for "Hylton Castle Boarding School" and the [[United Kingdom Census 1841|1841 census]] shows Wood, his family, pupils and staff as living on the estate.<ref>1841 England Census: Class: HO107; Piece 299; Book: 2; Civil Parish: Monkwearmouth; County: Durham; Enumeration District: 12; Folio: 17; Page: 2; Line: 1; GSU roll: 241347.</ref> The school does not seem to have existed for long as Howitt commented in 1842, that it was "a scene of great desolation&nbsp;... the windows for the most part, all along the front, are boarded up&nbsp;... the whole of this large old house is now empty&nbsp;... and in the most desolate state".<ref name="Meadows&Waterson43"/> However, he does go on to say the kitchen was occupied a poor family.<ref name="Meadows&Waterson43"/> By 1844, the chapel was used as a carpenter's workshop, and according to the ''Durham Chronicle'' in January 1856, the castle set on fire while in the occupation of a farmer, Mr. Maclaren.<ref name="Meadows&Waterson43"/><ref name="Billings48">Billings, p.48</ref>

In 1862, the castle was put up for sale by the Strathmores and purchased by William Briggs, a local timber merchant and ship builder.<ref name="Pevsner471"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandspastforeveryone.org.uk/resources/conversions/Hylton%20estate%20sale%201862.pdf |title=Hylton Castle Estate Sale 1862 |publisher=England's Past for Everyone |accessdate=2008-05-27}}</ref><ref name="Meadows&Waterson44">Meadows & Waterson, p.44</ref> Briggs set about to change the appearance of the castle to what he believed to be more "authentic[ally] medieval".<ref name="Pevsner471"/> He demolished the north and south wings, gutted the interior and added one, two and three-light [[Cusp (singularity)|cusp]]-headed windows.<ref name="Meadows&Waterson43"/> He also replaced the Gothic porch with a more "severe" Gothic doorway (three-bayed with [[cinquefoil]] arches) and an overhead balcony.<ref name="Pevsner471"/> To carry out these changes to the west front, he moved the [[Stone carving|stone-carved]] Hylton banner from above the west entrance to the front, left-flanking tower.<ref name="Pevsner471"/> The interior walls of the four-vaulted ground floor rooms were demolished, the whole floor was raised three-and-a-half feet and two [[reception room]]s were formed.<ref name="Hugill62">Hugill, p.62</ref> At the east end of the former central passage, [[dog-leg (stairs)|dog-leg stairs]] were constructed leading to the first floor, requiring removal of the [[oratory]] and rendering the main staircase inaccessible from the ground floor.<ref name="Pevsner471"/><ref name="Hugill62"/> The side walls of the great hall were removed to create a large [[salon]] and a large [[bay window]] was added to the south fa<U+00E7>ade, where the entrance to the south wing would have been.<ref name="Hugill62"/> The rooms above were kept untouched, except that a new entrance to the family/chaplain's room had to be formed via the main staircase.<ref name="Hugill62"/>

Alongside the medieval masonry, Briggs' alterations can still be seen today (albeit in ruins).<ref name="Pevsner471"/> Briggs' son, Colonel Charles James Briggs (father of [[Charles James Briggs|Sir Charles James Briggs]]) inherited the castle in 1871 and built the nearby St Margaret's church.<ref name="Meadows&Waterson44"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Castle Owner's Church Faces Demolition |url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/1172409/castle_owners_church_faces_demolition/index.html?source=r_technology |publisher=redOrbit |date=2007-12-06 |accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref>

===20th century===
[[Image:Hyltoncastleaaa11.jpg|thumb|right|275px|A photograph of the east fa<U+00E7>ade of Hylton Castle taken c.1954, showing the bow-fronted rooms which were later demolished.]]
After Colonel Brigg's death in 1900, the castle passed into the hands of the Wearmouth Coal Company about 1908, and from there to the [[National Coal Board]].<ref name="Meadows&Waterson44"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Hylton Colliery |url=http://www.dmm.org.uk/colliery/h013.htm?source=r_technology |publisher=Durham Mining Museum |accessdate=2008-07-29}}</ref> Due to the expansion of Sunderland in the 1940s, the castle became surrounded by housing estates including that of [[Castletown, Sunderland|Castletown]]. The castle was vandalised and had the lead from its roof stolen.<ref name="Meadows&Waterson44"/> In 1950, due to local pressure and the threat of demolition, the castle and chapel were taken into the care of the [[Ministry of Works]].<ref name="FHD"/><ref name="HCD"/> Due to the advanced decay of the 19th century alterations, the ministry removed all internal partitions and consolidated the shell to reveal the remaining [[medieval]] masonry.<ref name="Emery107">Emery, p.107</ref><ref name="HCD"/> The ministry also appointed a full time custodian and replaced the missing lead roof with [[roofing felt]] to make the site waterproof.<ref name="FHD"/>

In 1994, [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Time Team]]'' undertook excavations on the 'Eastern Terrace'. Their investigations revealed evidence of a medieval hall to the east of the castle; it has been suggested that the hall was used as a dining area.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hylton Castle, investigation history |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/events.aspx?a=0&hob_id=26206 |publisher=Pastscape.org.uk |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref>

===Chapel===
A chapel dedicated to [[Catherine of Alexandria|St Catherine of Alexandria]] is known to have existed on the site since 1157, when the Prior of [[Durham]] agreed to allow Romanus de Hilton to appoint his own [[chaplain]] for the chapel, subject to the prior's approval.<ref name="Hugill58">Huggill, p.58</ref> In return, de Hilton was to provide an annual contribution of 24&nbsp;sheaves of oats for every draught ox he owned, to the nearby [[monastery]] at [[Monkwearmouth]], and was required to attend the [[mother church]] of [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey|St Peters]] for the feasts of the [[Christmas|Nativity]], Easter, [[Whitsuntide]] and Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]].<ref name="Hugill58"/> In 1322, there was a [[chantry]] dedicated to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and there were three chantry priests in 1370.<ref>{{cite web |title=Scheduled Monuments. Hylton Castle: a medieval fortified house, chapel, 17th and 18th century |url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/Public/Editable/Themes/Environment/scheduled-monuments/hyltoncastle-chapel.asp |publisher=Sunderland City Council |accessdate=2008-05-25}}</ref>

The chapel, which is on a small hill to the north east of the castle, was rebuilt in stone in the early 15th century. It was modified from the late 15th to late 16th century, when a [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular Gothic]], five-light east window and [[transept]]s were added.<ref name="Pevsner471"/> Bucks' engraving of 1728, shows a short [[nave]] and a large six-light west window, and that the chapel was disused by this time, as it had no roof.<ref name="Pevsner473">Pevsner, p.473</ref> The west fa<U+00E7>ade of the chapel was later demolished and the [[chancel]] arch was built up to form a new one with a [[Gibbs surround]].<ref name="Pevsner473"/> A [[bell tower|bell-turret]] was added c.&nbsp;1805.<ref name="Pevsner473"/> On the north and south sides of the chapel are two [[transept]]al, semi-octagonal bays.<ref name="Pevsner473"/>

Although repairs to the chapel were carried out by the last Baron Hylton and the successive owners in the 19th century, it fell into disrepair until, like the castle, it was taken over by the [[state]] in 1950.<ref name="HCD"/>

===Modern===
The castle and chapel have been Grade I listed buildings since 1949 and form a Scheduled Ancient Monument under the care of [[English Heritage]], who took over the site in 1984, although Sunderland City Council own the land. In 1999, the ''Friends of Hylton Dene'' group was formed by residents of the estates around [[North Hylton]] "with the aim of co-operating with Sunderland City Council, [[Durham Wildlife Trust]] and other agencies to actively involve the local community in the development and upkeep of Hylton Dene and Castle". In December 2007, the group was awarded <U+00A3>50,000 by the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|Heritage Lottery Fund]] to carry out a survey for the future for the site.<ref name="HCF"/> Once restored, the castle could be opened. John Coulthard, the chairman of the Castle in the Community described the castle &ndash; which is Sunderland's second oldest building &ndash; as "an asset in the city &ndash; it is a lovely setting and we would love to see it bring in some income".<ref>{{cite web |title=Derelict castle could be reopened |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/7302110.stm |publisher=BBC Online |date=2008-03-18 |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref>

There have been four organised International Reunion(s) of Hylton Families over the past few years; most notably on [[4 July]] [[2004]], when around fifty American decendents of the Hylton family visited the castle to present a flag featuring featuring the Hylton [[blazon]].<ref name="LHI">{{cite web|url=http://www.lhi.org.uk/projects_directory/projects_by_region/north_east/sunderland/hylton_castle/ |title=Hylton Castle |publisher=Local Heritage Initiative |accessdate=2008-05-25}}</ref> The flag now flies from the recently installed flagpole, provided by English Heritage.<ref name="LHI"/>

The west fa<U+00E7>ade of the castle has square towers flanking the central bay, with others at the south west and north west, all topped with octagonal, [[machicolation|machicolated]] turrets.<ref name="Pevsner471"/> The north and south fa<U+00E7>ades are relatively simple. The east fa<U+00E7>ade has a central projection in the centre rising a storey above the parapet, to form a tower.<ref name="Pevsner472">Pevsner, p.472</ref> The tower's south angle is splayed to accommodate the main staircase and only the corbels of its parapet survive.<ref name="Pevsner472"/> The screen closing off the east entrance has a three-bay cusped [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] on the ground floor and three [[ogee]] arches on the shafts above.<ref name="Pevsner472"/>

The roof was originally covered with sheet lead and adorning the roof are stone warriors and other figures, similar to those of Raby, [[Alnwick Castle|Alnwick]] and the gates of [[York]].<ref name="Billings47"/><ref name="Pevsner471"/><ref name="Hugill60">Huggill, p.60</ref> Originally there were four figures on each corner turret and bartizan; only five have survived.<ref name="Hugill60"/> Between the central towers once stood a sculpture of a [[knight]] in combat with a serpent (of which only fragments survive), believed to pertain to the tale of the [[Lambton Worm]].<ref name="Billings48"/><ref name="Hugill60"/> The [[parapet]] is also machicolated (except on the north fa<U+00E7>ade) and continued between the central towers by a carved-foliage arch (originally with cusping which fell in 1882), instead of [[corbels]].<ref name="Pevsner471"/><ref name="Pettifer30"/> Another feature of the roof were shallow stone [[trough]]s on the battlements which fed scalding oil or water into the machiocaltions as a means of defence.<ref name="Hugill60"/> In a small chamber in each turret or [[bastion]], a [[brazier]] was kept burning to bring the liquids to a suitable temperature.<ref name="Hugill60"/>

==Interior layout==
[[Image:Emery FP Hylton Castle.png|thumb|right|500px|A plan of the original floors of Hylton Castle. ''Note'': The diagram does not include the [[minstrels' gallery]].]]
Before the changes made by John Hylton (died 1712), the castle's layout plan was as follows:

The ground floor, accessed directly from the outside [[courtyard]], led into a [[portcullis]]-protected, vaulted passage, eleven feet wide and extending the depth of the building. On either side of the passage were two vaulted rooms. The room nearest the entrance on the right was a [[guard]]room or the [[porter]]'s room, which housed a [[water well|well]]; the back-right room, with a [[garderobe]] located in the south west turret (accessed via a passage running along the south wall), was for an official.<ref name="Pevsner472"/><ref name="Emery108">Emery, p.108</ref> The other two rooms to the left were used to house staff or storage.<ref name="Pevsner472"/><ref name="Emery108"/>

The first was floor was accessed via the main staircase, situated in the east tower.<ref name="Pevsner472"/> The first room encountered was the great hall, which rose three floors. To the viewer's immediate left was a kitchen (with [[clerestory]] lighting), and further on to the left was a butlery and [[pantry]] with a garderobe.<ref name="Pevsner472"/> To the viewer's back right was a small passage containing a private staircase and the entrance to the [[oratory (worship)|oratory]] (its roof vaulted with an east window) in the east tower.<ref name="Pevsner472"/><ref name="Hugill59">Huggill, p.59</ref> The oratory was entered via a five-and-a-half high pointed-arch doorway and contained an altar and [[piscina]], of which only an ornamental [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] remains.<ref name="Pevsner472"/><ref name="Hugill59"/> There was a fireplace on the north wall of the great hall and behind the north wall was the [[great chamber]] containing a fireplace, garderobe and a window seat on the east wall.<ref name="Pevsner472"/><ref name="Emery108"/> To the west of the hall was the head of the west window.<ref name="Pevsner472"/> The portcullis is believed to have been raised into the hall in front of this window.<ref name="Pevsner472"/>

The kitchen, oratory and great chamber rose two floors, therefore only the [[minstrels' gallery]] was accessed via the main staircase on the second floor. However, the butlery and pantry was single-storeyed, but held the butler's chamber (with a garderobe) above it, accessed either via a staircase in that room or via the gallery.<ref name="Emery108"/>

The rooms on the north and east sides of the third floor were accessed via the private staircase.<ref name="Emery108"/><ref name="Hugill59"/> The rooms were two family rooms, one above the oratory and a larger one above the great chamber.<ref name="Emery108"/><ref name="Hugill59"/> The larger one had a fireplace and a garderobe, and was likely the baron's bedroom; the smaller room was either the chaplain's quarters or a family room.<ref name="Emery108"/><ref name="Hugill59"/> Both were connected via a [[lobby]] at the top of the private staircase.<ref name="Emery108"/><ref name="Hugill59"/>

The room on the south side (separated by the other rooms due to the hall's height) was accessed via the main staircase. This room also had a fireplace and a garderobe, and was probably used by guests.<ref name="Emery108"/>

Above the small family/chaplain's room on the third floor, was the servant's room with a corner fireplace and two windows on the [[mezzanine]] floor, accessed via the main staircase.<ref name="Hugill60"/><ref name="Emery108"/> Above, on the roof level, was the Warder's Chamber containing a stone-hooded fireplace, beamed ceiling, two small windows in the east wall and a garderobe.<ref name="Hugill60"/><ref name="Emery109">Emery, p.109</ref> There were also four closet-chambers in the turrets on the roof, used by staff.<ref name="Emery109"/>

==Heraldry==
The castle and chapel are adorned with [[heraldry|heraldic]] devices and shields of arms, providing information as to when the castle was constructed.

===West fa<U+00E7>ade===
Above the main entrance on the western fa<U+00E7>ade of the castle, there are twenty shields of arms. They are believed to show the political alliances of the early Hyltons, as the banner of the king, and the arms of nobles and knights of [[Northumberland]] and the [[County Palatine]] of [[County Durham|Durham]] are shown.<ref name="Emery107"/> In relation to the photograph, the shields are:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hyltoncastle.com/ |title=Heraldry |publisher=Friends of Hylton Dene |accessdate=2008-05-25}}</ref>

Although it was necessary for Briggs to move the Hylton banner to make way for a new entrance, it can be seen from a colour version of Bucks' engraving that the shields were previously placed not as they are today (particularly Weston and Skirlaw's).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panteek.com/BucksViews/pages/cs10-211.htm |title=West View of Hylton Castle, in the Bishoprick of Durham |publisher=Panteek |accessdate=2008-05-25}}</ref> Briggs is believed to have re-arranged the shields, disrupting their original [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] arrangement.<ref name="Emery107"/> Nevertheless, the arms give a date for the construction and completion of the castle as between 1390 and the early 1400s, due to the following reasons:
*The Earl of Northumberland [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartered]] his own arms with those of his second wife, Maud Lucy, after their marriage in c.1384.<ref name="Emery107" />
*Sir Henry "Hotspur" Percy did not [[Quartering (heraldry)|quarter]] his own arms with those of Lucy, until he inherited the [[Honour (land)|Honour]] of [[Cockermouth]] from his stepmother in 1398.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ancestryuk.com/SecretsofHyltonCastle.htm |title=The Secrets of Hylton Castle |publisher=AncestryUK.com |accessdate=2008-05-25}}</ref>
*The arms shown of Henry IV are those he adopted c.&nbsp;1400, after simplifying the French [[Quartering (heraldry)|quarters]] (see [[Armorial of Plantagenet]])

===East fa<U+00E7>ade===
The east fa<U+00E7>ade of the castle features a slanted shield containing the Hylton arms ([[Argent]], two bars [[Azure]]) and a white hart (male deer), lodged, chained and collared with a [[coronet]], [[Or (heraldry)|Or]]. The hart is possibly the [[Heraldic badge|badge]] used by [[Richard II of England]] (indicating construction began before Richard's deposition in 1399) or an earlier [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] used by the family after it was granted by [[William I of England]], in reward for the services of the previously mentioned Lancelot de Hilton.<ref name="Surtees"/><ref name="FHD"/> A "Moses head" (the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the Hylton arms) also features on the east fa<U+00E7>ade.<ref name="Surtees"/><ref name="DB">{{cite web|url=http://kerrysdavis.home.comcast.net/~kerrysdavis/p25.htm |title=The Davis-Bean Trees |publisher=Kerry S.

Over the north window: the same arms without [[supporters]], but with the Moses crest. On the west front, five shields, Hylton [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartering]] Vipont and Stapleton; [[supporters]] two Lions, no [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]; twice repeated.

==Hauntings==
{{main|Cauld Lad of Hylton}}
Hylton Castle is said to be haunted by the spirit of Roger Skelton, known as the Cauld (a pronounciation of "cold" in [[Mackem]]) Lad of Hylton. Various versions of how he was killed exist, the most popular being that he was [[decapitation|decapitated]] by Sir Robert Hylton (later ''de jure'' 13th Baron Hylton), after falling asleep and failing to get his master's horse ready on time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/daily/Was-the-Cauld-Lad-murdered.3530429.jp|title=Was the Cauld Lad murdered after all?|accessdate=2008-06-30 |author=Sarah Stoner|publisher=Sunderland Echo|date=[[November 28]], [[2007]]}}</ref> Skelton's sprit then began to haunt the castle and would move objects, similar to a [[poltergeist]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/daily/The-chilling-story-of-our.855743.jp|title=The chilling story of our most famous phantom (and one less well known)|accessdate=2008-06-30 |author=Ghosthunter|publisher=Sunderland Echo|date= [[September 15]], [[2004]]}}</ref> The spirit was said to have been finally laid to rest when the castle servants put a cloak out for him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/jacobs/english/cauldlad.html The Cauld Lad of Hilton|title=The Cauld Lad of Hylton|accessdate=2008-06-28 |author=Joseph Jacobs|publisher=Surlalune Fairytales|date=[[April 15]], [[2005]]}}</ref>
