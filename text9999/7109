The four-engine 747, produced by [[Boeing Commercial Airplanes|Boeing's Commercial Airplane unit]], uses a [[double-deck aircraft|double deck]] configuration for part of its length. The 747 is available in passenger, freighter and other versions.  The 747's hump created by the upper deck allows for a front cargo door on freighter versions. 

The [[Boeing 747-400|747-400]], the latest version in service, is among the fastest airliners in service with a high-subsonic cruise speed of [[Mach number|Mach]] 0.85 (567&nbsp;[[Miles per hour|mph]] or 913&nbsp;km/h).

==Development==
===Background and initial design===
The 747 was conceived while air travel was increasing in the 1960s.<ref name="Boe_storyIV">Cox, Joel.

Retrieved: [[8 December]] [[2007]].</ref> In 1965, Boeing lost the Heavy Logistics System (CX-HLS) competition for the development of a large  military transport, which would eventually result in the [[Lockheed]] [[C-5 Galaxy]]. Boeing's design proposal was instead considered internally as a basis for a commercial airliner.<ref>Wallace, James.

Retrieved: [[29 April]] [[2006]].</ref> Even before it lost the CX-HLS contract to Lockheed in September 1965, Boeing was pressed by  [[Juan Trippe]], president of [[Pan American World Airways]] (Pan Am), one of its most important airline customers, to build a passenger airplane more than twice the size of the 707.  During this time, airport congestion, worsened by increasing numbers of passengers carried on relatively small planes, became a problem that Trippe thought could be addressed by a large new aircraft.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/kcet/chasingthesun/innovators/jtrippe.html "Innovators: Juan Trippe"], ''PBS''.

In 1965, [[Joe Sutter|Joseph Sutter]] was transferred from Boeing's [[Boeing 737|737]] development team to manage the studies for a new airliner, already assigned the model number 747.<ref name="sutter_p.80">Sutter 2006, p. 80-84.</ref> Developing the aircraft was such a technical and financial challenge that management was said to have "bet the company" when it started the project.<ref name="ucfc747"/> The original design included a full-length double-deck fuselage with rows of eight-across seating and two aisles on the lower deck and seven-across seating and two aisles on the upper deck.<ref name="irving282">Irving 1994, p. 282.</ref> However, concern over evacuation routes and limited cargo-carrying capability caused this idea to be scrapped in early 1966 in favor of a wider single deck design.<ref name="ucfc747"/> Boeing agreed to deliver the first 747 to Pan Am by the end of 1969. The delivery date left 28 months to design the aircraft, which was two-thirds the normal time.<ref name="Sutter p.96">Sutter 2006, p. 96<U+2013>97.</ref>

In April 1966, Pan Am ordered twenty-five 747-100 aircraft for US$525 million. During the ceremonial 747 contract-signing banquet in Seattle on Boeing's 50th Anniversary, Juan Trippe predicted that the 747 would be "... a great weapon for peace, competing with [[Intercontinental Ballistic Missile|intercontinental missiles]] for mankind's destiny", according to [[Malcolm T. Stamper]], one of the senior management for the 747 program at the time.<ref name="Disc_Chan_747">[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6853359534780959649 "Great Planes-Boeing 747"], ''Discovery Channel''.

One of the principal technologies that enabled an airplane as large as the 747 to be conceived was the [[High-bypass turbofan engine#High-bypass turbofan engines|high-bypass turbofan engine]].<ref name="Mecham"/> The engine technology was thought to be capable of delivering double the power of the earlier [[turbojet]]s while consuming a third less fuel. [[GE Aviation|General Electric]] had pioneered the concept but was committed to developing the engine for the C-5 Galaxy and did not enter the commercial market until later.<ref>[http://www.geae.com/engines/commercial/cf6/history.html "GE Aviation: CF6"], GE Aviation.

Safety was a high priority on a large passenger airplane such as the 747.  It was designed with a new methodology called [[fault tree analysis]], which allowed the effects of a failure of a single part to be studied to determine its impact on other systems.<ref name="ucfc747"/>  To address concerns about safety and flyability, the 747's design included structural redundancy, redundant [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] systems, quadruple main landing gear and split control surfaces.<ref name="Sutter p.1218">Sutter 2006, p.121, 128-131.</ref>

[[Image:Boeing 747 prototype.JPG|thumb|right|The prototype 747, ''City of Everett'', at the [[Museum of Flight]] in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington]]]]

At the time, it was widely thought that the 747 would eventually be superseded by [[supersonic transport]] aircraft.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/852087.stm "Air travel, a supersonic future?"], ''BBC News'', [[17 July]] [[2001]]. Retrieved: [[9 December]] [[2007]].</ref> Boeing designed the 747 so that it could be adapted easily to carry freight and remain in production even if sales of the passenger version declined. The cockpit was, therefore, placed on a shortened upper deck so that a freight-loading door could be included in the nose cone; this design feature produced the 747's distinctive "bulge".<ref name="Boe_storyIV"/> However, the predicted obsolescence of the 747 by supersonic transports (SST), such as the [[Concorde]], [[Tupolev Tu-144]] and the canceled [[Boeing 2707]], never occurred; SSTs were not widely adopted because of high fuel consumption, noise, and [[sonic boom]] restrictions.<ref>[http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/news_events/futuristics/sst/ "Futuristics: Supersonic Transportation"], University of California-Berkeley.

===Production plant===
Because Boeing did not have a plant large enough to assemble the giant airliner, it chose to build a new one. The company considered locations in about 50 cities,<ref>Pascall, Glenn R. [http://seattle.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2003/09/29/editorial3.html "Everett and Renton react differently to Boeing"], ''Puget Sound Business Journal'', [[September 26]], [[2003]].  Retrieved: [[17 December]] [[2007]].</ref> and eventually decided to build the new plant some 30&nbsp;miles (48&nbsp;km) north of [[Seattle]] on a site adjoining a military base at [[Paine Field]] near [[Everett, Washington]].<ref name="boe_facilit">[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/facilities/index.html "Major Production Facilities - Everett, Washington"], The Boeing Company.

Retrieved [[17 December]] [[2007]]</ref>

Developing the 747 had been a major challenge, and building its assembly plant was also a huge undertaking. Boeing president [[William M. Allen]] asked Malcolm T. Stamper, then head of the company's turbine division, to oversee construction of the Everett factory and to start production of the 747.<ref>Boyer, Tom.

Work progressed so quickly that the plane's developers became known as "The Incredibles".<ref name="hist747" /> The plant is the largest building by volume ever built.<ref name="hist747" /><ref name="boe_facilit"/>

===Development and testing===
Before the first 747 was fully assembled, testing began on many components and systems. One important test involved evacuation of 560 volunteers from a cabin mock-up via the plane's emergency chutes. The first full-scale evacuation took two and a half minutes instead of the maximum of 90 seconds mandated by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], and several volunteers were injured. Subsequent test evacuations achieved the 90-second goal but caused more injuries. Most problematic was evacuation from the airplane's upper deck; volunteer passengers, instead of using a conventional slide, escaped by using a harness attached to a reel.<ref name="irving383">Irving 1994, p. 383.</ref>

Boeing built an unusual training device known as "Waddell's Wagon" (named for a 747 test pilot, Jack Waddell) that consisted of a mock-up cockpit mounted on the roof of a truck. While the first 747s were still being built, the device allowed pilots to practice taxi maneuvers from a high upper-deck position.<ref name="hist747" />

On [[30 September]] [[1968]], the first 747 was rolled out of the Everett assembly building before the world's press and representatives of the 26 airlines that had ordered the plane.<ref name="roll_out">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,838835,00.html "All but off the Ground"],  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', [[4 October]] [[1968]].

Over the following months, preparations were made for the first flight, which took place on [[9 February]] [[1969]], with test pilots Jack Waddell and Brien Wygle at the controls<ref name="first_flight">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,839015,00.html "The Giant Takes Off"],   ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.

Retrieved: [[17 December]] [[2007]].</ref> and Jess Wallick at the flight engineer's station. Despite a minor problem with one of the flaps, the flight confirmed that the 747 handled extremely well.  The plane was found to be largely immune to "[[Dutch roll]]", a phenomenon that had been a major hazard to the early swept-wing jets.<ref name="irving417">Irving 1994, p. 417<U+2013>418.</ref>

During later stages of the flight test program, [[flutter]] testing showed that the wings suffered oscillation under certain conditions. This difficulty was partly solved by reducing the stiffness of some wing components. However, a particularly severe high-speed flutter problem was solved only by inserting [[depleted uranium]] counterweights as ballast in the outboard engine [[nacelle]]s of the early 747s.<ref name="irving428">Irving 1994, p. 428.</ref> This measure caused anxiety when these aircraft crashed, as did [[China Airlines Flight 358]] at [[Wanli]] in 1991 and [[El Al Flight 1862]] at [[Amsterdam]] in 1992.<ref> Uijt de Haag, P.A., Smetsers, R.C., Witlox, H.W., Krus H.W. and Eisenga, A.H.

The [[flight test]] program was hampered by problems with the plane's JT9D engines.  Difficulties included engine stalls caused by rapid movements of the throttles and distortion of the turbine casings after a short period of service.<ref name="irving441">Irving 1994, p. 441-446.</ref> The problems delayed 747 deliveries for several months and stranded up to 20 planes at the Everett plant while they awaited engine installation.<ref name="engine_trouble">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844949,00.html "The Trouble with Jumbo"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', [[26 September]] [[1969]].</ref> The program was further delayed when the one of five test aircraft suffered serious damage during a landing attempt at Renton Municipal Airport, site of Boeing's [[Renton, Washington|Renton]] plant.

Cokely undershot the short runway and sheared off the 747's landing gear.<ref name="irving436">Irving 1994, p. 436.</ref> However, these difficulties did not prevent Boeing from taking one of the test aircraft to the 28th [[Paris Air Show]] in mid-1969, where it was displayed to the general public for the first time.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/companyNewsAndPR/idUSL148638820070614 "The Paris Air Show in facts and figures"], ''Reuters'', [[14 June]] [[2007]].

The huge cost of developing the 747 and building the Everett factory meant that Boeing had to borrow heavily from a banking syndicate. During the final months before delivery of the first airplane, the company had to repeatedly request additional funding to complete the project. Had this been refused, the Boeing's survival would have been threatened.<ref name="irving437-438">Irving 1994, p. 437<U+2013>438.</ref><ref name="infoplease" /> Ultimately, the gamble succeeded, and Boeing held a monopoly in very large passenger aircraft production for many years.<ref>[http://www.a380.singaporeair.com/content/news/newsrelease/20070816/index.html "First A380 Flight on 25-26 October"], [[Singapore Airlines]], [[16 August]] [[2007]].

==Design==
The Boeing 747 is a large, wide-body (two-aisle) airliner with four wing-mounted engines. The wings have a high [[swept wing|sweep]] angle of 37.5 degrees for a fast, efficient cruise<ref name="Sutter p.93">Sutter 2006, p. 93.</ref> of Mach&nbsp;0.84 to 0.855, depending on the variant. The sweep also allows the 747 to use existing [[hangar]]s.<ref name="ucfc747" /><ref>Bowers 1989, p. 508.</ref> Seating capacity is more than 366 with a 3-4-3 seat arrangement (a cross section of 3 seats, an aisle, 4 seats, another aisle, and 3 seats) in economy class and a 2-3-2 arrangement in first class on the main deck. The upper deck has a 3-3 seat arrangement in economy class and a 2-2 arrangement in first class.<ref>[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/airports/acaps/7471sec2.pdf "Boeing 747-400 Airport Planning report, section 2.0, Boeing, December 2002 (PDF)"], The Boeing Company.

[[Image:Cargolux B747-400F.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cargolux]] 747-400F with the nose loading door open]]

Raised above the main deck, the [[Boeing fuselage Section 41|cockpit]] creates a hump. The raised cockpit is to allow front loading of cargo on freight variants.<ref name="Sutter p.93" /> The upper deck behind the cockpit provides space for a lounge or extra seating. The "stretched upper deck" became available as an option on the 747-100B variant and later as standard on the 747-300.

The 747's maximum takeoff weight ranges from 735,000&nbsp;pounds (333,400&nbsp;kg) for the -100 to 970,000&nbsp;lb (439,985&nbsp;kg) for the -8. Its range has increased from 5,300&nbsp;nautical miles (6,100&nbsp;mi, 9,800&nbsp;km) on the -100 to 8,000&nbsp;nmi (9,200&nbsp;mi, 14,815&nbsp;km) on the -8I.<ref>[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/747family/pf/pf_classics.html Boeing 747-100/200/300 "Technical Specifications"], The Boeing Company.

The 747 has multiple structural redundancy including four redundant [[hydraulic]] systems and four main landing gears with 16 wheels, which provide a good spread of support on the ground and safety in case of tire blow-outs. The redundant main gear allows for landing on two opposing landing gears if the others do not function properly.<ref name="Sutter p.128">Sutter 2006, p. 128<U+2013>131.</ref> In addition, the 747 has split control surfaces and sophisticated triple-slotted [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] that minimize landing speeds and allow the plane to use standard-length runways.<ref name="Sutter p.121">Sutter 2006, p. 121<U+2013>122.</ref> For transportation of spare engines, early 747s could accommodate a non-functioning fifth-pod engine under the port wing of the aircraft between the nearest functioning engine and the fuselage.<ref>[http://www.airdisaster.com/special/special-ai182.shtml "Special Report:Air India Flight 182"], ''airdisaster.com''.

==Variants==
The 747-100 was the original variant launched in 1966. The 747-200 soon followed, with an order in 1968. The 747-300 was launched in 1980 and was followed in 1985 by the 747-400. Lastly, the 747-8 was announced in 2005. Several versions of each variant have been produced.  Many of the early variants were in production simultaneously, especially in the 1970s.

====747-100SR====
Responding to requests from Japanese airlines, Boeing developed the 747-100SR as a "short range" variant of the 747-100. The SR has a lower fuel capacity but can carry more passengers, up to 498 in early versions and more than 550 in later models,<ref name="Boe_747_classics" /> because of increased economy class seating.

===Undeveloped variants===
Boeing has studied a number of 747 variants that have not gone beyond the concept stage.

====747-300 Trijet====
During the 1970s, Boeing studied the development of a shorter body, three-engined 747 to compete with the smaller [[Lockheed L-1011|Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]] and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], which had lower trip costs than the 747SP. The 747-300 Trijet would have had more payload, range and passenger capacity. The center engine would have been fitted in the tail with an S-duct intake similar to the L-1011's.  However, engineering studies showed that a time-consuming and costly redesign of the 747 wing would be necessary.<ref>[http://www.747sp.com/Explained.asp "The Story of the Baby 747"], ''Boeing 747SP website''. Retrieved: [[16 December]] [[2007]].</ref>

====747-500X, -600X and -700X====
Boeing announced the 747-500X and -600X at the 1996 [[Farnborough Air Show]].<ref name="boe_1996">[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/747family/news/1996/news.release.960902c.html "Boeing Outlines the "Value" of Its 747 Plans"], The Boeing Company, [[2 September]] [[1996]]. Retrieved: [[17 December]] [[2007]]. </ref> The proposed models would have combined the 747's fuselage with a new 251&nbsp;ft (77&nbsp;m) span wing derived from the [[Boeing 777|777]]. Other changes included adding more powerful engines and increasing the number of tires from two to four on the nose landing gear and from 16 to 20 on the main landing gear.<ref name="faa_nla">Patterson, James W.

The 747-500X concept featured an 18&nbsp;ft (5.5&nbsp;m) stretch to 250&nbsp;ft (76.2&nbsp;m) long, and the aircraft was to carry 462 passengers over a range up to 8,700&nbsp;nautical miles (10,000&nbsp;mi, 16,100&nbsp;km), with a gross weight of over 1.0&nbsp;[[Mega-|Mlb]] (450&nbsp;[[Megagram|Mg]]).<ref name="faa_nla" /> The 747-600X concept featured a greater stretch to 279&nbsp;ft (85&nbsp;m) with seating for 548 passengers, a range of up to 7,700&nbsp;nmi (8,900&nbsp;mi, 14,300&nbsp;km), and a gross weight of 1.2&nbsp;Mlb (540&nbsp;Mg).<ref name="faa_nla" /> A third study concept, the 747-700X, would have combined the wing of the 747-600X with a widened fuselage, allowing it to carry 650 passengers over the same range as a 747-400.<ref name="boe_1996" /> The cost of the changes from previous 747 models, in particular the new wing for the 747-500X and -600X, was estimated to be more than $5 billion.<ref name="boe_1996" /> Boeing was not able to attract enough interest to launch the aircraft.<ref name="FI_500X"/>

====747X and 747X Stretch====
As Airbus progressed with its [[Airbus A380|A3XX]] study, Boeing in 2000 offered the market a 747 derivative as an alternative. This was a more modest proposal than the previous -500X and -600X that would retain the 747's overall wing design and add a segment at the root, increasing the span to 229&nbsp;ft (70&nbsp;m).<ref name="boe_747X">[http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2000/news_release_000121a.html "Boeing 747 Celebrates 30 Years In Service"], The Boeing Company, [[2 September]] [[1996]].

Like its predecessor, the 747X family was unable to garner enough interest to justify production, and it was shelved along with the 767-400ERX in March 2001, when Boeing announced the [[Boeing Sonic Cruiser|Sonic Cruiser]] concept.<ref name="shelv_747X"/> Though the 747X design was less costly than the 747-500X and -600X, it was criticized for not offering a sufficient advance from the existing 747-400. The 747X did not make it beyond the drawing board, but the 747-400X being developed concurrently moved into production to become the [[Boeing 747-400#747-400ER|747-400ER]].<ref>[http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2000/news_release_001128c.html "Boeing Launches New, Longer-Range 747-400"], The Boeing Company. Retrieved: [[17 December]] [[2007]].</ref>

====747-400XQLR====
After the end of the 747X program, Boeing continued to study improvements that could be made to the 747. The 747-400XQLR (Quiet Long Range) was meant to have an increased range of 7,980&nbsp;nmi (9,200&nbsp;mi, 14,800&nbsp;km), with improvements to improve efficiency and reduce noise.<ref name="Boe_747-400XQLR">[http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2002/q1/nr_020225h.html "Boeing Offers New 747-400X Quiet Longer Range Jetliner"], The Boeing Company, [[February 26]], [[2002]]. Retrieved: [[17 December]] [[2007]].</ref> Improvements studied included raked wingtips similar to those used on the 767-400ER and a sawtooth engine nacelle for noise reduction.<ref>Steinke, Sebastian. [http://www.flug-revue.rotor.com/frheft/FRH0205/FR0205c.htm "Boeing Proposes 747-400X Quiet Longer Range"], ''Flug Revue Online'', May 2002. Retrieved: [[17 December]] [[2007]].</ref> Although the 747-400XQLR did not move to production, many of its features were used for the 747 Advanced, which has now been launched as the [[Boeing 747-8|747-8]].

==Out of service 747 aircraft==
[[Image:Co-747-N33021-040108-05.JPG|thumb|right|While later versions are still in production, earlier variants have been retired.  This [[Continental Airlines]] 747-200 at the [[Mojave Airport]], has been cut up for scrap.]]

As increasing numbers of "classic" 747-100 and 747-200 series aircraft have been retired although some have found their way into museums.  The ''[[City of Everett]]'', the first 747 and prototype is at the [[Museum of Flight]], [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington]], [[United States|USA]] where it is sometimes leased to Boeing for test purposes.<ref>[http://www.museumofflight.org/Collection/Aircraft.asp?RecordKey=2779CA3D-8016-4339-A7E2-5AAC663A3E3D "Aircraft and Space Craft, Boeing 747-121"], Museum of Flight. Retrieved: [[15 December]] [[2007]].</ref>  Other 747 in museums include those at the [[National Aviation Theme Park Aviodrome]], [[Lelystad]], [[Netherlands]]; the [[Qantas Founders Outback Museum]], [[Longreach, Queensland|Longreach]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]; [[Rand Airport]], [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]]; [[Technik Museum Speyer]], [[Speyer]], [[Germany]]; [[Mus<U+00E9>e de l'Air et de l'Espace]], [[Paris]], [[France]]; Tehran Aerospace Exhibition, [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]; Jeongseok Aviation Center, [[Jeju]], [[South Korea]]<ref>[http://thebluesky.info/44 "The Blue Sky"], ''thebluesky.info''. Retrieved: [[17 December]] [[2007]].</ref>, and the [[National Air and Space Museum]], [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>[http://wtopnews.com/?nid=25&sid=1034371 "Historic Aircraft Lands at Air and Space Museum"], ''WTOP News'', [[16 January]] [[2007]].</ref>

==Incidents==
{{main|Boeing 747 hull losses}}
As of [[As of 2007|May 2007]], a total of 45 [[Aviation accidents and incidents|hull-loss accidents]] involving 747s had occurred,<ref>[http://aviation-safety.net/database/type/type.php?type=104 "Boeing 747 Accident summary"], ''Aviation-Safety.net'', [[5 May]] [[2007]].  Retrieved: [[17 December]] [[2007]].</ref> and these had caused 3,707 fatalities.<ref>[http://aviation-safety.net/database/type/type-stat.php?type=104 "Boeing 747 Accident Statistics"], ''Aviation-Safety.net'', [[5 July]] [[2005]]. Retrieved: [[17 December]] [[2007]].</ref>

Very few crashes have been attributed to design flaws of the 747. The [[Tenerife disaster]] resulted from pilot error, air traffic control (ATC) error and communications failure, while the [[Japan Airlines Flight 123]] crash stemmed from improper aircraft repair. [[United Airlines Flight 811]], which suffered an explosive decompression mid-flight on [[24 February]] [[1989]], led the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) to issue a recommendation that 747-200 cargo doors similar to those on the Flight 811 aircraft be modified. [[TWA Flight 800]], a 747-100 that exploded in midair on [[17 July]] [[1996]], led the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] to propose a rule requiring installation of an [[inerting system]] in the center fuel tank of most large aircraft.
