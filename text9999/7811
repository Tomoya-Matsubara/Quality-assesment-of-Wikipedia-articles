'''Israel the Grammarian'''{{efn|Israel is called the Grammarian by most modern scholars, but Edouard Jeauneau refers to him as "Israel Scot"<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', p. 87, n. 1</ref> (meaning Irish) and Michael Wood as "Israel of Trier".<ref>Wood, "A Carolingian Scholar", p. 135</ref>}} (fl. c. 900 - c. 960) was one of the leading European scholars in the middle of the tenth century. He was probably a [[Breton people|Breton]], and spent some time at the court of King [[<U+00C6>thelstan]] of England (924-939). When <U+00C6>thelstan died, Israel successfully sought the patronage of Archbishop Rotbert of [[Trier]], and became tutor to [[Bruno the Great|Bruno]], who was later to be [[Archbishop of Cologne]]. Israel is recorded as a bishop in the late 940s, and at the end of his life he was a monk at the [[Benedictine]] monastery of [[St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier|Saint-Maximin]] in Trier.

Israel was an accomplished poet. A disciple of the ninth-century Irish philosopher, [[John Scottus Eriugena]], he was one of the few scholars of his time to understand Greek. He wrote theological and grammatical tracts, and commentaries on the works of other philosophers and theologians.

==Sources==
Poems and prose works by Israel survive, as do manuscripts containing his copies of and commentaries on works by other scholars. A text known as the "Gospel Dice" shows that he spent some time at the court of King <U+00C6>thelstan, and he is mentioned in tenth-century continental source such as [[Flodoard]]'s chronicle and Ruotger's life of Bruno.<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', pp. 87-90</ref> Israel is the subject of essays by a number of modern historians, including [[Michael Lapidge]]<ref>Lapidge, "Israel the Grammarian in Anglo-Saxon England", ''Anglo-Latin Literature 900-1066'', pp. 87-104</ref> and [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]].<ref>Wood, "A Carolingian Scholar in the Court of King <U+00C6>thelstan", ''England and the Continent in the Tenth Century'', pp. 135-162</ref>

==Early life==
Very little is known about Israel's early life. Michael Lapidge dates his birth to around 900,<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', pp. 88-89</ref> while Michael Wood places it slightly earlier, around 890.<ref name="Wood p. 138">Wood, "A Carolingian Scholar", p. 138</ref> He was a disciple of Ambrose, and spent some time at Rome, but it is not known who Ambrose was or whether he was Israel's tutor in Rome.<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', pp. 88, 92</ref> In Wood's view he was a monk at Saint-Maximin in Trier in the 930s.<ref name="Wood p. 138"/>

Tenth-century sources provide conflicting evidence on Israel's origin. Ruotger referred to Israel as Irish, whereas Flodoard described him as "Britto", which may refer to Brittany, Cornwall or Wales.<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', p. 90</ref> According to Michael Lapidge:
:There is pervasive confusion in tenth-century continental sources as to whether Israel was a Briton (from Wales or Cornwall), a Breton (from Britanny) or an Irishman. The consensus of modern scholarship is in favour of an Irish origin, but the matter has not been properly investigated.<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', pp. 87-88</ref>
Lapidge argues that the bishop of [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] in [[County Down]], Dub Innse, described Israel as a "Roman scholar", and that he therefore does not appear to have recognised him as a fellow Irishman, and further that Flodoard was contemporary with Israel and may have known him, whereas Ruotger wrote after Israel's death and probably did not have first hand knowledge. Giving children [[Old Testament Hebrew]] names was common in Celtic areas in the tenth century. Lapidge concludes that Brittany is more likely than Wales or Cornwall, as manuscripts associated with him have Breton glosses, and <U+00C6>thelstan's court was a haven for Breton scholars fleeing Viking occupation of their homeland.<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', pp. 89-92, 99-103</ref>

Michael Wood has revived the Irish theory, arguing that Flodoard's 'Israel Britto' "can hardly be pressed as meaning 'Breton'", and that Ruotger knew Israel,<ref>Wood, "Stand strong against the monsters", pp. 205-206; Wood, "A Carolingian Scholar", pp. 141-142</ref> but his view is rejected by [[Sarah Foot]], who states that Israel was not Irish and may have been a Breton.<ref name=Foot104>Foot, ''<U+00C6>thelstan'', p. 104</ref> [[Thomas Charles-Edwards]] thinks he may have been Welsh.<ref>Charles-Edwards, ''Wales and the Britons'', p. 635</ref>
[[File:Gospel Dice.jpg|thumb|A twelfth-century illustration of Gospel Dice, the board game which Israel and Franco drew for Dub Innse]]
==<U+00C6>thelstan's court==
Israel's presence in England is known from a gospel book written in Ireland in about 1140, which contains a copy of a tenth-century drawing and explanation of a board game called "Gospel Dice", based on [[canon tables]] (concordances for parallel texts of the four gospels). According to a note on the manuscript:
:Here begins the Gospel Dice which Dub Innse, bishop of Bangor, brought from the English king, that is from the household of <U+00C6>thelstan, King of England, drawn by a certain Franco [or Frank] and by a Roman scholar, that is Israel.<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', p. 89</ref>

Dub Innse, who died in 853, was bishop of Bangor in County Down, Ireland. The twelfth-century copyist appears to have changed Dub Innse's original first person note to the third person. In a later passage, he interpreted "Roman scholar, that is Israel" as meaning a Roman Jew (''Iudeus Romanus''). This has been taken by some historians, including David Wasserstein, as showing that there was a Jewish scholar at <U+00C6>thelstan's court, but MIchael Lapidge argues that this interpretation was a misunderstanding by the copyist, and his view has been generally accepted by historians.<ref>Wasserstein, "The first Jew in England", pp. 283-288; Lapidge,  ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', p. 89, n. 17; Foot, ''<U+00C6>thelstan'', p. 104</ref> Israel is thought to be Israel the Grammarian, described as a Roman scholar because of his time in the city, and the Gospel Dice manuscript shows that he spent a period at <U+00C6>thelstan's court. A number of manuscripts associated with Israel, including two of the four known copies of his poem ''De arte metrica'', were written in England.<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', pp. 92-103</ref> In the view of Sarah Foot:
:Israel provides a tantalising link between the spheres of masculine camaraderie of a conventional royal court and the more rarified, scholarly atmosphere that <U+00C6>thelstan may have liked both his contemporaries and posterity to think he was keen to promote.<ref>Foot, ''<U+00C6>thelstan'', p. 105</ref>

Israel was a practitioner of the "hermeneutic style" of Latin, which was characterised by long, convoluted sentences and a predilection for rare words and neologisms. He probably influenced the scribe known to historians as "<U+00C6>thelstan A", an early exponent of the style in charters he drafted between 928 and 935. Hermeneutic Latin was to become the dominant style of the Benedictine reform movement of the later tenth century, and Israel may have been an early mentor of one of its leaders, [[<U+00C6>thelwold of Winchester|<U+00C6>thelwold]], [[Bishop of Winchester]], at <U+00C6>thelstan's court in the 930s.<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', p. 107; Gretsch, ''Intellectual Fundations'', pp. 314-315, 336</ref> The Latin texts which Israel brought to <U+00C6>thelstan's court were influenced by Irish writers, and Jane Stevenson sees them as contributing a Hiberno-Latin element to the hermeneutic style in England.<ref>Stevenson, "The Irish contribution", p. 176</ref>

==Later career==
Israel's poem ''De arte metrica'' was dedicated to Rotbert, Archbishop of Trier. The poem was almost certainly composed in England, and the dedication was probably a successful plea for Rotbert's patronage when Israel when <U+00C6>thelstan died in 939. From about 940 Israel was the tutor of Bruno, the future Archbishop of Trier and brother of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Otto the Great]]. In 947 Israel attended a synod at [[Verdun]] presided over by Rotbert.<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', pp. 88, 103</ref> Israel was famous as a schoolmaster, and he probably played an important role in Emperor Otto's establishment of a court school at Aachen.<ref name="Wood p. 142">Wood, "A Carolingian Scholar", p. 142</ref>

Tenth-century sources describe Israel as a bishop, and in about 950 a man with this name is identified as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Aix|bishop of Aix-en-Provence]], but it is not certain that he was Israel the Grammarian.<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', p. 88</ref> Between 948 and 950 he may have held a bishopric in [[Aachen]], where he debated Christian ideas about the Trinity with a Jewish intellectual called Salomon, probably the Byzantine ambassador of that name.<ref>Wood, "A Carolingian Scholar", p. 160</ref> He retired to become a monk at the monastery of Saint-Maximin in Trier, and died on 26 April in an unknown year. Lapidge sets his death in about 970, whereas Wood dates it before the 967-8.<ref>Lapidge, "Israel the Grammarian", pp. 88-89; Wood, "A Carolingian Scholar", pp. 138, 161</ref>

==Scholarship==
Charters produced from 928 by King <U+00C6>thelstan's scribe, "<U+00C6>thelstan A", include unusual words almost certainly copied from the Hiberno-Irish poems ''Adelphus adelphe'', and ''Rubisca''. They display a sophisticated knowledge of Greek, and are described by Lapidge as "immensely difficult". It is likely that the poems were brought by Israel from the Continent and ''Adelphus adelphe'' was probably, and ''Rubisca'' possibly, his work.<ref name=ASEIsrael/><ref name=Woodman227-228/>{{efn|Lapidge states that Israel probably wrote ''Rubisca'',<ref name=ASEIsrael/> but other scholars prefer a date before his time;<ref name=Woodman227-228>Woodman, "<U+00C6>thelstan A", pp. 227-228</ref> Jane Stevenson thinks it was written by an Irish scholar on the Continent in the late ninth or early tenth century.<ref>Stevenson, "The Irish contribution", p. 277</ref>}}

Mechthild Gretsch calls Israel "one of the most learned men in Europe",<ref>Gretsch, ''Intellectual Fundations'', p. 314</ref> and Michael Lapidge says that he was "an accomplished grammarian and poet, and one of the few scholars of this time to have first-hand knowledge of Greek."<ref name=ASEIsrael>Lapidge, "Israel the Grammarian", ''Blackwell Encyclopedia''</ref> He also wrote on theology and collected works of medicine.<ref name="Wood p. 142"/> In the 940s he became interested in the work of John Scottus Eriugena, and commented on them in a manuscript which survives in Leningrad.<ref>Lapidge, "Israel the Grammarian", pp. 87, 103</ref> In another manuscript [[Interlinear gloss|glossing]] [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphryr's]] [[Isagoge]], he recommended John's [[Periphyseon]]. His [[redaction]] of a commentary on [[Aelius Donatus|Donatus's]] ''Ars Minor'' was a major teaching text in the Middle Ages and was still in print in the twentieth century.<ref>Wood, "A Carolingian Scholar", pp. 140, 149</ref>
