'''Mastodons''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: <U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03CC><U+03C2> "breast" and <U+1F40><U+03B4><U+03BF><U+03CD><U+03C2>, "tooth") are an extinct group of mammal species related to [[elephant]]s, that inhabited [[North America|North]] and [[Central America]] during the late [[Miocene]] or late [[Pliocene]] up to their extinction at the end of the [[Pleistocene]] 10,000 to 11,000 years ago.<ref name = "Fiedal">{{Cite book

They lived in herds and were predominantly forest dwelling animals that fed on a mixed diet of [[Browsing (herbivory)|browsing]] and [[grazing]] with a seasonal preference for browsing, in contrast to living elephants that are mostly grazing animals.

The American mastodon is the most recent and best-known species of the genus. They disappeared from North America as part of a [[Quaternary extinction event|mass extinction]] of most of the [[Pleistocene megafauna]], widely presumed to have been a result of rapid climate change in North America, as well as the sophistication of stone tool weaponry used by the [[Clovis culture|Clovis hunters]] which may have caused a gradual attrition of the mastodon population.

==Etymology==
[[File:Mastodon teeth.jpg|thumbnail|left|American mastodon molars at the State Museum of Pennsylvania]]
The name ''Mastodon'' (or ''mastodont'') means nipple tooth ([[Greek language|Greek]]: <U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03CC><U+03C2> "nipple" and <U+1F40><U+03B4><U+03BF><U+03CD><U+03C2>, "tooth"),<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mastodon ''mastodon''] [[Online Etymology Dictionary]] Retrieved 10 November 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mastodon ''mastodon''] [[Merriam-Webster]] Retrieved 30 June 2012</ref> and was assigned by the French anatomist [[George Cuvier]], derived from the cone-shaped cusps of their tooth which resembles the shape of nipples.  ''Mastodon'' as a genus name is obsolete;<ref>{{cite book |author=Agusti, Jordi and Mauricio Anton |year=2002 |title=Mammoths, Sabretooths, and Hominids |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |pages=106 |isbn=0-231-11640-3}}</ref> the valid name is ''Mammut'', a name that preceded Cuvier's description, making ''Mastodon'' a junior synonym. The change was met with resistance, and authors sometimes applied ''"Mastodon"'' as an informal name so it became the common term for members of the genus.

==Description==
''Mastodons'' were similar in appearance to elephants and [[mammoth]]s, though not closely related. Compared to mammoths, mastodons had shorter legs, a longer body and were more heavily muscled,<ref name=lange>{{cite book|last=Lange|first=I.M.|title=Ice Age Mammals of North America: A Guide to the Big, the Hairy, and the Bizarre|year=2002|publisher=Mountain Press Publishing|isbn=0878424032|pages=166<U+2013>168|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pSEWZJjSCn8C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|edition=illustrated}}</ref> a build similar to that of the current [[Asian elephant]]s. The average body size of the species ''M. americanum'' was around {{convert|2.3|m|abbr=on}} in height at the shoulders, corresponding to a large female or a small male, but large males could grow up to {{convert|2.8|m|abbr=on}}<ref name=Woodman>{{cite journal|last=Woodman|first=N.|title=The Overmyer Mastodon (Mammut americanum) from Fulton County, Indiana|journal=The American Midland Naturalist|year=2008|volume=159|issue=1|pages=125<U+2013>146}}</ref>  in height and weigh as much as {{convert|4.5|t|ST|0}}.<ref name=Sullivan>{{cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Robert M.|title=Rising from the muck: The Marshalls Creek mastodon|journal=Pennsylvania Heritage|year=2010}}</ref>  Like modern elephants, the females were smaller than the males. They had a low and long skull with long curved tusks,<ref name=Lucas&Alvarado/> with those of the males being more massive and more strongly curved.<ref name=Woodman/> Mastodons had cusp-shaped teeth, different from mammoth and elephant teeth (which have a series of enamel plates), well-suited for chewing leaves and branches of trees and shrubs.<ref name=Sullivan/>

==Discovery==
The first remains of ''Mammut'' were found in the village of [[Claverack, New York]], in 1705, a tooth some {{convert|2.2|kg|lbs|0|abbro=on}} in weight, which became known as the <U+201C>incognitum<U+201D>. Some time later, similar remains were found in South Carolina, which according to the slaves, looked remarkably similar to those of [[African elephant]]s, soon followed discoveries of complete bones and tusks in Ohio, and people started referring to the "incognitum" as a mammoth, like the ones that were being dug out in Siberia. Anatomists noted that the teeth of mammoth and elephants were different from those of incognitum, which possessed rows of large conical cusps, indicating that they were dealing with a distinct species.<ref name=Smithsonian>{{cite web|last=Conniff|first=Richard|title=Mammoths and Mastodons: All American Monsters|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/Mammoths-and-Mastodons-All-American-Monsters.html|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=23 December 2012|month=April|year=2010}}</ref>

Over the years, several fossils from localities in North America, Africa and Asia have been attributed to ''Mammut'', but only the North American remains have been named and described, one of them being ''M. furlongi'', named from remains found in the Juntura Formation of Oregon, dating from the late Miocene.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shotwell|first=J.A|coauthors=D.E., Russell|title=Mammalian fauna of the upper Juntura Formation, the black butte local fauna. in The Juntura Basin: Studies in Earth History and Paleoecology|journal=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society|year=1963|volume=53|issue=1|pages=77}}</ref> However, it is no longer considered valid,<ref>{{cite book|last=Lambert|first=W.D.|title=Proboscidea.

==Paleobiology==

===Social behavior===
[[File:La Brea Mastodons.jpg|thumbnail|left|Female and calf American mastodon at the George Page Museum.]]
Based on the characteristics of mastodon bonesites we can infer that, like in modern proboscideans, the Mastodon social group consisted of adult females and young, living in bounded groups called mixed herds. The males abandoned the mixed herds once reaching sexual maturity and lived either alone or in male bond groupings. Unlike modern elephants, the evidence suggest that there probably was no seasonal synchrony of mating activity, with both males and females seeking out each other for mating when sexually active.<ref name=Haynes>{{cite journal|last=Haynes|first=G.|coauthors=Klimowicz, J.|title=Mammoth (''Mammuthus'' spp.) and American mastodont (''Mammut americanum'') bonesites: what do the differences mean?|journal=Advances in Mammoth Research|year=2003|volume=9|pages=185<U+2013>204 |url= http://www.unr.edu/cla/anthro/people/faculty/haynes/download%20Haynes+KlimowiczDeinsea03.pdf}}</ref>

===Range and habitat===
[[File:Knight Mastodon.jpg|thumb|Restoration of a herd by [[Charles R. Knight]]]] 
The range of most species of ''Mammut'' is unknown as their occurrences are restricted to few localities, the exception being the American mastodon (''M. americanum''), which is one of the most widely distributed Pleistocene proboscideans in North America, ranging in age from the faunal stages of Blancan to Rancholabrean and with fossil sites from as north as Alaska, as east as Florida and as south as the state of Puebla in central Mexico,<ref name="Polaco">{{cite book| first = O.

===Diet===
Mastodons have been characterized as predominantly browsing animals, most accounts of gut contents have identified coniferous twigs as the dominant element in their diet, in other accounts (Burning tree mastodon) have found no coniferous content and suggest selective feeding on low, herbaceous vegetation, implying a mixed browsing and grazing diet,<ref name=Lepper91>{{cite journal|title=Intestinal Contents of a late Pleistocene Mastodont from Midcontinental North America|journal=Quaternary Research|year=1991|volume=36|pages=120<U+2013>125|author=Lepper et al.|bibcode = 1991QuRes..36..120L |doi = 10.1016/0033-5894(91)90020-6 }}</ref>  evidence supported by studies of isotopic bone chemistry but displaying a seasonal preference for browsing.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=D.

==Extinction==
They are generally reported as having disappeared from North America about 10,500 years ago<ref name = "Fiedal"/> as part of a [[Quaternary extinction event|mass extinction]] of most of the [[Pleistocene megafauna]], widely presumed to have been as a result of human hunting pressure.<ref name = "Martin">{{cite book
