''The Tab Hunter Show'' had a good time slot, 8:30 Eastern on [[Sunday]]s, and an impressive selection of guest stars, but the episodes had the same theme and similar plots. It failed to  compete effectively with [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]'s ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' variety program and the [[Western (genre)|western]] series ''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]'' starring [[John Russell (actor)|John Russell]] and [[Peter Breck]]. ''The Tab Hunter Show'' followed ''[[National Velvet (TV series)|National Velvet]]'', based on a successful [[film]] of the same name on the [[Sunday]] evening schedule. It preceded ''[[The Dinah Shore Show]]''. In 1961-1962, the entire NBC Sunday schedule was revised, with ''National Velvet'' moved to [[Monday]]s, ''[[Bonanza]]'' shifted to the [[Dinah Shore]] slot, and ''The Tab Hunter Show'' was cancelled.<ref>1960-1961 American network television schedule</ref>
