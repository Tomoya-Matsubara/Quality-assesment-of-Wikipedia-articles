== Plot ==
The [[Israeli Defense Minister]] Israel Navon (Doron Tavory) moves to a house on the border between [[Israel]] and the [[West Bank]], with the building sitting on the Israeli side just next to the dividing line. The Israeli Secret Service views the neighboring lemon grove of Salma Zidane ([[Hiam Abbass]]), a Palestinian widow whose family has cared for the area for generations, as a threat to the Minister and his wife. The security forces soon set up a guard post and a [[barbed wire]] fence around the grove. They then obtain an order to uproot the lemon trees.<ref name="grove" /><ref name="jenkins" />

Salma feels isolated given that her son has moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] and her daughters are now married. The local village elder Abu Kamal (Makram Khoury) advises her to give in, but Salma decides to work with the young lawyer Ziad Daud ([[Ali Suliman]]). They take their case all the way to the [[Israeli Supreme Court|Supreme Court]]. Mira Navon (Rona Lipaz-Michael), the minister's wife, sympathizes with Salma. The court case receives notable media attention, and Mira gives a news interview that her husband regrets. Mira believes that the Israeli military overreacted, and she also shares Salma's sense of personal [[loneliness]]. A complex, though not always evident, human bond develops between the two women despite the fact that the characters never actually meet.<ref name="grove">[http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/movies/17lemo.html?ref=movies In a Grove, a War of Wills and Words]. By Stephen Holden. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Date published April 17, 2009. Accessed October 4, 2009.</ref><ref name="jenkins" /> As the Palestinian cause is dismissed, Mira moves out, divorcing her husband and a concrete wall is built between Salma's land and the Defense Minister's house. A final camera shot reveals the lemon trees to have been cut off.

=== Production details ===
Director [[Eran Riklis]] covered personal relationships between Arabs and Middle Eastern Jews in his previous films ''[[The Syrian Bride]]'' and ''Cup Final''.<ref name="jj">[http://www.jewishjournal.com/arts/article/lemon_tells_bittersweet_tale_of_coexistence_20090421/ <U+2018>Lemon<U+2019> Tells Bittersweet Tale of Coexistence]. By Tom Tugend. [[JewishJournal.com]] Published April 21, 2009. Accessed October 4, 2009.</ref> The former film, which also starred [[Hiam Abbass]], achieved widespread success in Israel as well as with international audiences after its 2004 release. This boosted Riklis expectations for the future.<ref name="sweet" /><ref name="haaretz" />

The plot of ''Lemon Tree'' was based on a real life incident. [[Israeli Defense Minister]] [[Shaul Mofaz]] moved to the border within Israel and the [[occupied territories]] and security forces began cutting down the [[olive trees]] beside his house, arguing that it could be used by terrorists as a hiding place.<ref name="alt">[http://www.altfg.com/blog/interviews/lemon-tree-eran-riklis-interview/ LEMON TREE: Q&A with Eran Riklis].

=== Subject material ===
Riklis designed the film to be essentially apolitical, focusing on character development rather than exploring the issues of the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]].<ref name=sweet/> He has said that he created a '[[fairy tale|fairy tale quality]]' to the film in which the audience can sympathize with all of the people featured it. He stated that "I wanted to populate this film with a lot of faces and give each character their own moment of grace, even when, on the surface, it's one of the 'bad guys,' so to speak... This film does address the ugly side of occupation perhaps, yet no blood is spilled."<ref name=sf/> A fictional representation of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|Israeli-West bank separation wall]] punctuates the film throughout.<ref name=jenkins/>

Critic Andrew O'Hehir of [[Salon.com]] has argued that Riklis "depicts all versions of Middle Eastern authority with a cheerful, agnostic cynicism", portraying the [[Palestinian government]] as "corrupt and obsessed with status and protocol" and the [[Israeli government]] as "hypocritical and mindlessly bureaucratic."<ref name=round/> V.A. Musetto of ''[[The New York Post]]'' argued that the movie expresses Riklis' opposition to Israeli policies of confiscation of Palestinian land.<ref name=nyp>[http://www.nypost.com/seven/04172009/entertainment/movies/juicy_politics_in_fruitful_flick_164753.htm Juicy Politics in Fruitful Flick].

''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that:
{{quote|Although <U+201C>Lemon Tree<U+201D> doesn<U+2019>t overtly take sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it portrays the Israelis, who wield more military power, as abusive and arrogant in the way that any country with superior weapons and armies inevitably appears. The security guards on Navon<U+2019>s property behave like strutting goons <U+2014> only too eager to turn their guns on the first thing that moves <U+2014> or clowns, like the watchtower guard nicknamed Quickie, who dozes off while on duty.<ref name=grove/></blockquote>}}

Riklis tried not to make the film [[Feminist film theory|explicitly feminist]], with the female characters portrayed more sympathetically than the male ones. However, he has said that it can be interpreted that way by viewers.<ref name=alt/> [[National Public Radio|NPR's]] Mark Jenkins has stated that the film's bittersweet ending depicted the difficult status of women in Palestine as well as Palestinian-Israeli relations.<ref name=jenkins/> Chris Cabin of the [[AMC Network]] criticized the film as being too "fem-centric" and as having a uniformly negative treatment of its male characters.<ref name=AMC>{{citeweb|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/Lemon-Tree|first=Chris|title=Lemon Tree|last=Cabin|publisher=[[AMC Network]]|accessdate=October 4, 2009}}</ref>

The film has performed poorly with Israeli audiences despite the positive reaction in other area. Riklis has said that Israelis have the "false impression" that the film is pro-Palestinian and [[polemical]].<ref name=sf/> The Palestinian reaction has been very positive, according to Riklis.<ref name=alt/> He expected a far more positive reception in Israel given the success of his previous film, ''[[The Syrian Bride]]'', in 2004.<ref name=haaretz>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/952528.html New film 'Lemon Tree' offers fresh look at Mideast conflict].
