'''Household Hacker''' is a [[YouTube]] channel and [[website]] that posts videos of various "hacks", or quick solutions, to common everyday problems. They are known for their high-profile hoaxes, especially "How to Charge an iPod using electrolytes and an onion." As of July 2009, the channel was the second most subscribed "guru" channel on YouTube, and the 27th most subscribed overall. 

==Background==
The Household Hacker YouTube channel is dedicated to making "videos about everything geek".<ref name="Youtube">{{cite web|title=Household Hacker YouTube channel|url=http://www.youtube.com/user/HouseholdHacker|accessdate=July 14, 2009}}</ref>  The videos, which are cross-posted at householdhacker.com, are the work of two anonymous editors known as "Traveler and Frosty Brain" or "Spencer and Dylan" who reside in [[San Jose, California]] and [[Peachtree City, Georgia]].<ref name="Youtube" /><ref name="latimes" />  Each video features a simple hack, or "a quick and/or clever creation for a method of solving of a problem."<ref name="Youtube" /> Household Hacker makes money by offering subscription downloads and T-shirts, but the duo told the LATimes that they do not make enough money to "live off comfortably at this point."<ref name="latimes">{{cite web|last=Milian|first=Mark|title=YouTube video creators make money, but not a fortune|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/01/make-money-yout.html|date=January 11, 2009|work=Technology: The Business of our Digital Lives |publisher=[[LA Times]]|accessdate=July 14, 2009}}</ref> 

Household Hacker was launched in November 2007 and quickly attracted interest, becoming YouTube's most subscribed channel for the month of December 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=British monarchy makes YouTube debut|first=Peter|last=Sayer|url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/mobilize/british-monarchy-makes-youtube-debut-271|work=Mobilize|publisher=[[InfoWorld]]|date=December 26, 2007|accessdate=July 14, 2009}}</ref> By January 2009, Household Hacker was the 22nd most subscribed YouTube channel.<ref name="latimes" />  The channel's popularity began to wane and by July they had fallen to 27th place overall.<ref name="Youtube" />  As of July 2009, Household Hacker is the second most subscribed "guru" channel on YouTube.<ref name="Youtube" />

Their work, more recently, began to shift to a more social level, having long revealed both their full names and faces, with more blogging, discussions on [[video games]], and a more recent "Scientific Tuesdays" segment, rather than the semi-legitimate how-to videos that the duo was known for. This has attracted a new audience, and helped significantly in retaining the old one, marking a revival after a slight decline in their popularity.

==iPod Onion==
In November 2007, Household Hacker released a video entitled "How to Charge an iPod using electrolytes and an onion."  The video, which claimed to demonstrate how one could recharge an [[iPod]] using little more than [[Gatorade]] and a [[white onion]], was an overnight success. The video drew the attention of the Unofficial Apple Weblog, which reported it as fact,<ref>{{cite web|title=Charge an iPod with an onion|first=Mike|last=Schramm|url=http://www.tuaw.com/2007/11/14/charge-an-ipod-with-an-onion/|publisher=TUAW: The Unofficial Apple Weblog|date=November 14, 2007|accessdate=July 14, 2009}}</ref> and hundreds of other blogs. Within its first week, the video had been viewed over 4 million times.<ref name="Vanguardia">{{cite web|title=<U+00BF>Es posible cargar un iPod con una cebolla?|first=Anna|last=Solana|url=http://www.lavanguardia.es/premium/publica/publica?COMPID=53414326676&ID_PAGINA=22088&ID_FORMATO=9&turbourl=false|publisher=[[La Vanguardia]]|date=November 29, 2007|language=Spanish|trans_title=Is it possible to charge an iPod with an onion?|accessdate=July 14, 2009}}</ref> 

[[File:IPod Onion.JPG|thumb|The Household Hacker setup for charging an iPod]]
By the following November, the video had been viewed more than 7 million times and attracted the attention of [[ABCNews.com]], who asked "Can an Onion Charge an iPod?"<ref name="ABC">{{cite web|title=Can an Onion Charge an iPod?|first=Emily|last=Friedman|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Science/Story?id=6339986&page=1|work=[[ABCNews.com]]|date=November 26, 2008|accessdate=July 14, 2009}}</ref> ABC put the video to the test, but failed to obtain the promised result. Reporter Emily Friedman remarked "this appears to be an iFraud."<ref name="ABC" /> 

[[MythBusters]] also put the onion video to the test in 2008. In a segment dubbed [[MythBusters (2008 season)#iOnion|"iOnion"]], [[Grant Imahara|Grant]] was unable to get any charge from the onion setup found in the Household Hacker video.<ref name="OnionMyth">{{cite web|title=MythBusters: iOnion|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/mythbusters-ionion.html|work=[[Discovery Channel]] videos|date=August 13, 2008|accessdate=July 14, 2009}}</ref>  He explained that the setup lacked the crucial [[anode]] and [[cathode]] that would be required to get the [[electrolyte]]s found in Gatorade moving and concluded the video was a complete hoax.<ref name="OnionMyth" /> In an interview with ABCNews, [[Adam Savage]] called the video "complete horseshit."<ref name="ABC" />

===Appeal===
The iPod onion video fooled a number of normally savvy folks, or at least had them trying the technique out for themselves,<ref name="Salon">{{cite web|title=How to power an iPod with an onion (not really)|first=Farhad|last=Manjoo|url=http://machinist.salon.com/blog/2007/11/21/householdhacker/|work=Machinist|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|date=November 21, 2007|=July 14, 2009}}</ref> which has led to several theories as to why it was so appealing. Farhad Manjoo of [[Salon.com]] speculates that it is the style in which the video was delivered.  "He's got a friendly, helpful voice, but he's not casual &ndash; he speaks in the formal, confident manner of a TV how-to guy," says Manjoo.<ref name="Salon" /> Anna Solana of [[La Vanguardia]], on the other hand, speculated that it was the "science" itself that attracted the viewers, remarking that something so magical "freaks" people out and makes them want to believe.<ref name="Vanguardia" />

==Follow up videos==
Following the iPod onion success, Household Hacker has released a number of videos that have generated some attention, but none that have risen to the level of the iPod onion. A March 2008 video entitled "How to Cheat on any Test" has attracted 4 million views and the ire of some school teachers. While a video entitled "How to Create a High-Def speaker for under a buck" again drew the attention of MythBusters.  [[Tory Belleci|Tory]] followed the instructions in the video, but when it came time to plug in the speakers nothing happened. In addition to disproving the video, he pointed out that the "under a buck" part of the claim was also false, noting that a single [[minijack]] alone typically costs about $10 retail.<ref>{{cite web|title=MythBusters: Homemade Surround Sound|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/mythbusters-homemade-surround-sound.html|work=[[Discovery Channel]] videos|date=April 29, 2009|accessdate=July 14, 2009}}</ref> However, it is possible to get minijack cables for under a dollar online.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planet4one.de/planet/wbc.php?sid=37091237225c&pid=25045&tpl=pdetail.html|title=Cinchkabel 2x Cinch St an 3,5mm Klinke St 0,5m|work=Planet4One Technology store}}</ref> While the focus of the channel has become more social, they have taken humor into the truthfulness of their early videos. In the first "Ask HouseholdHacker" video, when questioned the validity of the speaker video, the camera was panned, revealing a surround-sound stereo system presumably constructed out of paper plates and aluminum foil.

In addition to high profile hoaxes, the Household Hacker channel hosts a number of less provocative videos such as "How to Prank your Roommate on April Fools" and "How to make a secret, disguised safe."<ref name="Youtube" />
