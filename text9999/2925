'''liligo.com''' is a [[search engine]] that specialises in travel. Launched in 2006, the website allows users to compare travel products (flight tickets, hotels, holidays, car hires) in order to find the cheapest price. It can also be categorised as a [[comparison shopping website]].<ref>[http://www.quotidiendutourisme.com/site/telex-Delta/distribution-le-comparateur-liligo-tire-le-meilleur-des-low-cost-32011.html http://www.quotidiendutourisme.com/site/telex-Delta/distribution-le-comparateur-liligo-tire-le-meilleur-des-low-cost-32011.html] ''Le quotidien du tourisme'' mai 2008 ''French''</ref>

Searches are made from hundreds of travel agencies, airlines, hotel chains, booking sites, tour operators and car hire agencies<U+2026>

The site is also available in [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]].

== History ==

liligo.com is a production of Findworks Technologies, a start-up founded by Pierre Bonelli, Bertrand de la Ruelle, Xavier Corbel and Mika<U+00EB>l Quilfen in 2005. Based in [[Paris]] and [[Budapest]] in [[Hungary]], the company currently employs around 50 people.

In May 2009, the site launched its first television ad<ref>[http://www.creads.org/blog/actualite-pub-marketing/liligo%25E2%2580%25A9-senvoie-en-lair-avec-sa-derniere-campagne-publicitaire/ http://www.creads.org/blog/actualite-pub-marketing/liligo%E2%80%A9-senvoie-en-lair-avec-sa-derniere-campagne-publicitaire/]</ref>.

In September 2010, SNCF, via its site Voyages-sncf, announced it would take a major stake in liligo.com for the amount of 20 million Euros, according to Les Echos.<ref>[http://www.sncf.com/resources/fr_FR/press/kits/PR0101_20100923.pdf Communiqu<U+00E9> de presse], SNCF.com, 23 septembre 2009 in French</ref>
liligo.com was resold 3 years later to European tourism giant {{lien|ODIGEO}}.

== Technology ==

Using [[Java]] and [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] technology,]<ref>{{fr}}  [http://www.journaldunet.com/solutions/dsi/interview/07/0918-it-dt-liligo.shtml J<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>mie Murat (Liligo.com) : <U+00AB><U+00A0>Toute la partie cliente de notre site Web est r<U+00E9>alis<U+00E9>e en Ajax<U+00A0><U+00BB>], ''Journal du Net'', 18 septembre 2007</ref> the site allows users to search for travel products (flight tickets, hotels, etc.) from among a number of online travel agencies. It distinguished itself early on for its use of [[Software widget|widget]]s.<ref>{{fr}} [http://www.journaldunet.com/ebusiness/tourisme/analyse/070927-witgets-de-liligo/index.shtml L'apport des Widgets : le cas de Liligo], ''Journal du net'', 27 septembre 2007</ref>.

liligo.com sells nothing but instead redirects users to the supplier site of the selected offer. A price calendar allows users to compare flight prices over several months in order to find the cheapest time of the year to travel. Creating an alert warns users of rising or dropping prices for desired flight routes. Finally, the price map gives users the possibility to find the best flights according to different criteria (journey duration, expected temperature, maximum price). 

Mobile and tablet applications are also available.<ref>[http://www.liligo.co.uk/static/rss/press-release/2013-04-04-PR-Mobile_en.pdf ''Press release liligo.com'' Mobile application April 2013]</ref><ref>[http://www.liligo.co.uk/static/rss/press-release/2013-10-28_CP_iPad_liligo_en.pdf ''Press release liligo.com'' Ipad application October 2013]</ref>

== Performance ==

Available in 11 European countries, liligo.com attracts more than 3 million unique visitors per month and distinguishes itself from other meta-search sites by displaying real-time flight prices that include all additional fees (credit card fee, booking fee<U+2026>) and also searches low cost airlines.<ref>http://www.lefigaro.fr/web/2010/09/23/01022-20100923ARTFIG00579-voyages-sncfcom-s-empare-du-comparateur-liligo.php ''Le Figaro'' septembre 2010 ''in French''</ref>
