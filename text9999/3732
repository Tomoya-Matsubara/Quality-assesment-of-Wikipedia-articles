The '''1997 Michigan Wolverines football team''' represented the [[University of Michigan]] in the [[1997 NCAA Division I-A football season]].  In its third year under head coach [[Lloyd Carr]], Michigan compiled a perfect 12&ndash;0 record, won the [[Big Ten Conference]] championship, defeated [[1997 Washington State Cougars football team|Washington State]] in the [[1998 Rose Bowl]], and was declared the [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national champion]] by the [[Associated Press]], ''[[Football News]]'', [[Football Writers Association of America]], National Championship Foundation, [[National Football Foundation]], and ''[[Sporting News]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/football_records/DI/2009/2009FBS.pdf|title=2009 Division I Football Records Book: Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) Records|accessdate=2010-07-09|publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]|page=81}}</ref>  The [[1997 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska Cornhuskers]], who also went undefeated and beat [[1997 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee]] in the [[1998 Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]], captured the top spot in the final [[Coaches' Poll]].  

Michigan's defense was led by [[cornerback]] and [[Heisman Trophy]]-winner [[Charles Woodson]].  Woodson, who [[Interception|intercepted]] 8 passes and also scored touchdowns as a receiver, rusher and punt returner, became the first primarily defensive player to win the Heisman.  Woodson and [[defensive end]] [[Glen Steele]] were both first-team selections on the [[1997 College Football All-America Team]].  Other standouts on defense included [[linebacker]]s [[James Hall (American football)|James Hall]] with 8.5 [[quarterback sack]]s, [[Sam Sword]] with 91 [[tackle (football move)|tackles]] and [[Dhani Jones]] with 90 tackles and 6 sacks.  The defense allowed no fourth quarter points or second half touchdowns in the first eight games.  The unit's performance across all games in [[total defense]] (222.8 yards per game) and scoring defense (9.5 points per game) are the lowest marks by any Big Ten Conference football team since the 1985 season.

On offense, the 1997 Michigan team had neither a 1000-yard rusher nor a 500-yard receiver.  [[Tai Streets]] was the leading receiver with 476 receiving yards, and [[Chris Howard (American football)|Chris Howard]] led the team in [[Rush (American football)|rush]]ing with 938 rushing yards.  [[Quarterback]] [[Brian Griese]] set Michigan single-season records with 193 pass completions and 307 pass attempts.  With 437 receiving yards and 5 touchdowns, [[tight end]] [[Jerame Tuman]] was the only player on the offensive unit selected as a first-team All-American.

Ten members of the team were honored as All-Big Ten Conference selections, and [[running back]] [[Anthony Thomas (American football)|Anthony Thomas]] was named the [[Big Ten Conference football individual honors#Freshman of the Year|Big Ten Freshman of the Year]].  Thirty-one members of the 1997 Wolverines football team went on to play in the [[National Football league|NFL]]. Prior to 1997, the Wolverines had experienced four consecutive four-loss seasons and had not won a national championship in nearly 50 years, the [[1948 Michigan Wolverines football team|1948 Michigan team]] having been the last to accomplish the feat.

===Quarterback competition===
The months before the 1997 season opener featured uncertainty over the quarterback position.  Junior [[Scott Dreisbach]] had started 11 games for the [[1996 Michigan Wolverines football team|1996 team]],<ref name=t96>{{cite web|title=1996 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1996fbt.htm|accessdate=2010-08-04}}</ref> but fifth-year senior Brian Griese had relieved Driesbach in the Ohio State game after Driesbach was injured and helped the team recover from a 9&ndash;0 deficit.<ref name=CFARGtLD/>  Dreisbach and Griese also faced competition from sophomore and future [[Super Bowl MVP]], [[Tom Brady]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:BNWB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EAF9A5A79B14873&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=The Chase For No. 1 <U+2013> Penn State, Washington Top Contenders|accessdate=December 8, 2009|date=August 23, 1997|work=[[The Buffalo News]]|page=C5|author=Northrup, Milt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:USTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=127E2B9B6CD4DE20&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Michigan buckles down|accessdate=December 8, 2009|date=August 20, 1997|work=[[USA Today]]|page=C5|author=Chengelis, Angelique S.}}</ref>  Shortly before the season opener, head coach Lloyd Carr announced his selection of Griese as the starting quarterback.<ref name=CFARGtLD>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/13/sports/college-football-a-rivalry-good-to-last-drop-or-catch.html|title=College Football; A Rivalry Good to Last Drop (Or Catch)|accessdate=2010-07-21|date=1997-09-13|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Moran, Malcolm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:USTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=127E2BA40BB71988&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Michigan starter: Griese|accessdate=December 8, 2009|date=September 9, 1997|work=[[USA Today]]|page=S11|author=Chengelis, Angelique S.}}</ref> 

===Receiving corps===
Despite uncertainty at quarterback, Michigan entered the 1997 season with a solid group of receivers, including [[Tai Streets]] and [[Russell Shaw]].  Analysts believed that a solid season by any of the Michigan quarterbacks could lead to a productive season in the passing game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CLDB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10DF3B848869FDE0&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Wolverines Eager To Scale Mountain|accessdate=December 8, 2009|date=September 11, 1997|work=[[The Columbus Dispatch]]|page=13E|author=Baptist, Bob}}</ref>  Moreover, it was anticipated that Charles Woodson, who was regarded as one of the most versatile athletes in college football,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:USTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB773117B908ACC&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=1997 PREVIEW Team-by-team outlooks [Part 1 of 2]|accessdate=December 8, 2009|date=August 22, 1997|work=[[USA Today]]|page=6E}}</ref> would play on offense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:ABJB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB6C088F6BD4D20&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=He's A Turncoat, And Proud Of It Ohio Native Charles Woodson Likes Nothing Better Than Beating Buckeyes|accessdate=December 8, 2009|date=August 23, 1997|work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]]|page=C1|author=Paulk, Ralph}}</ref>  

===Holes in the offensive line=== 
The offensive line was another uncertainty for the 1997 team.  Three linemen from the 1996 team had been selected in the [[1997 NFL Draft]]: [[Center (American football)|center]] [[Rod Payne]] (3rd round, 76th overall), [[offensive guard]] [[Damon Denson]] (4th, 97) and [[defensive tackle]] William Carr (7th, 217).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/draft/history/fulldraft?season=1997|title=1997 - Round 1|accessdate=2010-07-21|publisher=[[NFL.com]]}}</ref>  As a result, Michigan began the season with only one offensive lineman, [[offensive tackle]] [[Jon Jansen]],  who had started a game.<ref name=CFMWGMC/>  Jansen, a junior, had 25 consecutive starts entering the season.

===Strength of schedule===
Adding to the challenges facing the 1997 team, Michigan entered the season with the toughest schedule among the 112 NCAA Division I-A schools based on records from the previous year.<ref name=Columbus>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CLDB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10DF3B848869FDE0&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Wolverines Eager To Scale Mountain|accessdate=2009-12-08|date=1997-09-11|work=[[The Columbus Dispatch]]|page=13E|author=Baptist, Bob}}("Based on opponents' records last season, Michigan will play the toughest schedule of 112 NCAA Division I-A schools, facing teams that combined to win 65.8 percent of their games.")</ref>  Days before the season opener, Lloyd Carr compared the daunting schedule to an expedition to [[Mount Everest]].

The Big Ten tie-breaker left the possibility that an Ohio State win coupled with two Penn State wins could send Michigan to the Rose Bowl because Ohio State had gone to the Rose Bowl the prior year and the rule book said: "If three teams are tied, and all three teams have the same winning percentage of all games played in the traditional 11-game schedule, the most recent team representing the conference shall be eliminated, and the two remaining teams shall revert to the two-team tie procedure," unless a Big Ten team ranked first or second in the polls used by the bowl alliance, overriding other tie-breaker considerations.<ref name="OCFBMINSTtR"/>  Thus, Ohio State would likely need either Wisconsin or Michigan State to beat Penn State at Penn State or Florida State to lose to the [[1997 Florida Gators football team|Florida Gators]] at [[Ben Hill Griffin Stadium|The Swamp]] in addition to overcoming its own 1&ndash;7&ndash;1 record against Michigan under Cooper.<ref name=OCFBMINSTtR/>  In each of the prior two seasons underdog Michigan teams beat undefeated Ohio State teams to conclude the Big Ten season.<ref name=CFTSRRaR/>  Since 1935, when the [[Michigan <U+2013> Ohio State football rivalry|Michigan <U+2013> Ohio State rivalry]] game was moved to be the last game of the Big Ten season for each team, 37 have had the potential to determine the conference champion.<ref name=CFTSRRaR/>  This was the eighth time that both schools were ranked among the top five.<ref name=CFTSRRaR/>  Both schools have ended four of the other school's perfect seasons during this rivalry.<ref name=CFTSRRaR/>  Michigan's entered the game with an 8.4 points average points allowed, which was the lowest by any major school in nine seasons, while Ohio State's 10.8 average ranked second.<ref name=CFTSRRaR/> However, Michigan's average of 88.2 rushing yards allowed was eighth in the nation, while Ohio State's 131.7 average was 38th best.<ref name=CFTSRRaR/> Entering the game, Howard had posted 100-yards rushing efforts in three of the last four Michigan games.<ref name=CFTSRRaR/>

Griese, who was voted Rose Bowl MVP, led Michigan to a 379 yards on offense, which nearly equaled the 398 yards gained by Washington State.<ref name=CFMBVaCtN1/> Griese completed 18 of 30 passes for 251 yards, including 3 touchdown passes: 53 and 58 yards to Streets and a 23-yard pass to Tuman with 11:21 remaining for the games final margin of victory.<ref name=CFMBVaCtN1/>  Leaf totaled 331 yards passing which was fifth highest in Rose Bowl history by completing 17 of 35 passes.<ref name=CFMBVaCtN1/> Black injured his [[calf muscle]] and was held to 24&nbsp;yards on 7 carries, while the team totaled just 67&nbsp;yards.<ref name=CFMBVaCtN1/> Streets had 4 receptions for 127 yards.<ref name=WSvM/>  Woodson had an interception and key offensive contributions late in the game.<ref name=WSvM/>

In the first quarter, Washington State downed a punt at the 1 and forced a punt without a first down.  After regaining possession at the Wolverines 47, Leaf connected with McKenzie on a 15-yard play to take a 7&ndash;0 lead with 3:07 remaining.<ref name=WSvM/> Michigan moved the ball to the Washington State 37 before punting. Leaf marched the Cougars to the Michigan 14, but Woodson intercepted him in the end zone.<ref name=WSvM/>  The teams traded punts before Griese found Streets in stride on the right sideline for a 53-yard TD pass to tie the game with 7:08 left in the first half.<ref name=WSvM/> Leaf opened the second half with a 99-yard drive for a go-ahead touchdown to take a 13&ndash;7 lead after the extra point was blocked.<ref name=WSvM/>  Key plays on the drive included a 19-yard pass Shawn McWashington and a 30-yard pass Kevin McKenzie to reach the Michigan 38.

Then a 42-yard pass to [[DeJuan Gilmore]] moved the ball to the Michigan 27. Washington State settled for a [[Rian Lindell]] 48-yard field goal with 7:25 to play to make the score 21&ndash;16.<ref name=WSvM/> Michigan started a drive that included four consecutive third down conversions and consumed most of the clock.  The conversions were as follows: a 3rd-and-11 Griese scrambled to the Michigan 29; a 3rd-and-7 lateral to Woodson who faked a pass before running eight yards to keep the drive alive; a 3rd-and-6 13-yard pass to Shaw; and a 3rd-and-7 pass to Woodson taking the ball to the Washington State 33.<ref name=WSvM/>  A pooch punt by Feely from field goal formation left Washington on its own 7-yard-line with 29 seconds remaining.<ref name=WSvM/> The game ended in confusion with Leaf, who announced he would hold a press conference to announce his intent to forgo his senior season and enter the [[1998 NFL Draft]], being deemed to late in an attempt to spike the ball to stop the clock for a last play.<ref name=CFMBVaCtN1/>  The drive began at the Cougar 7-yard-line with 16 seconds left to play.<ref name=CFMBVaCtN1/> Leaf completed a 46-yard pas to Nian Taylor to move the ball to the Michigan 47.<ref name=CFMBVaCtN1/>  Washington State drew an illegal formation penalty with 9 seconds remaining, but executed a hook and lateral play for 26-yards to the Michigan 26, with a 8-yard catch by Love Jefferson and an 18-yard run by Jason Clayton who was tackled by Weathers and Jones.<ref name=CFMBVaCtN1/>  With 2 seconds to play the clock was stopped to move the chains.<ref name=CFMBVaCtN1/> With no timeouts left, Leaf spiked the football, but Dick Burleson, the referee from the Southeastern Conference crew, shook his head as Leaf contested the decision.<ref name=CFMBVaCtN1>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/02/sports/college-football-michigan-grasps-victory-and-claim-to-no-1.html|title=College Football; Michigan Grasps Victory, and Claim to No. 1|accessdate=2010-07-29|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1998-01-02}}</ref>  Michigan's victory evened the series between the Pac-10 and Big 10 in the Rose Bowl at 26 wins apiece.<ref name=WSvM/>
