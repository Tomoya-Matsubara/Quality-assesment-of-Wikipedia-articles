'''Typhoon Angela''' (International designation: '''''8923'''''; PAGASA designation: '''Rubing''') was an intense [[tropical cyclone]] that formed in late September 1989. The storm developed from a tropical disturbance in the [[monsoon trough]] and moved generally westward throughout its duration. The storm ultimately peaked in intensity as a super typhoon and struck northern [[Luzon]] in the [[Philippines]]. After weakening and traversing the [[South China Sea]], Angela bypassed [[Hainan]] to the south and struck [[Vietnam]] before dissipating. The storm caused severe damage and 119 fatalities in the Philippines. Thousands of houses were damaged, and hundreds of thousands of residents were impacted by the typhoon. Monetary damage is placed at $192 million.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Angela 1989 track.png}}
The origins of Typhoon Angela trace back to a tropical disturbance in the [[monsoon trough]] that became very active after a lull in convection. The disturbance developed over the western [[Caroline Islands]], and persisted for two days until it was noted in a Significant Tropical Weather Advisory issued by the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC). It rapidly matured, and prompted a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert shortly thereafter. Enhanced upper-level [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] assisted the storm's intensification.<ref name="ATCR">{{cite web|author=[[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]|publisher=[[United States Navy]]|year=1990|accessdate=January 26, 2010|title=1989 Annual Tropical Cyclone Report for the Western Pacific|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/atcr/1989atcr/pdf/chapter3.pdf|format=[[PDF]]}}</ref> At 0600 UTC on September 28, the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] (JMA) recognized the storm as a tropical depression.<ref name="JMA">{{cite web|publisher=Japan Meteorological Agency|year=1991|accessdate=January 26, 2010|title=JMA Best Tracks 1986-1990|url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/Besttracks/bst8690.txt}}</ref> The JTWC issued their first advisory on the depression, designated 34W, at 0600 UTC on September 29.<ref name="ATCR"/> However, at the same time, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm.<ref name="JMA"/> 

At 1800 UTC on September 29, the JTWC classified the depression as Tropical Storm Angela. The system initially tracking northwestward, Angela turned westward along the southern periphery of a [[subtropical ridge]] to the north. The tropical storm began to rapidly intensify,<ref name="ATCR"/> and the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm at 1800 UTC on September 30,<ref name="JMA"/> while the JTWC estimated that it had attained typhoon intensity.<ref name="ATCR"/> The JMA then upgraded Angela to a typhoon shortly thereafter, and assessed it as having reached peak intensity on October 2, with 10-minute [[maximum sustained winds]] of 175&nbsp;km/h (110&nbsp;mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 925 [[millibars]].<ref name="JMA"/> Continuing westward, the typhoon attained super typhoon status four days later, and the JWTC reported that Angela peaked in strength on October 5. Between October 5 and October 6, Angela crossed the northern coast of [[Luzon]] in the [[Philippines]].<ref name="ATCR"/>

The storm weakened after interacting with land, and the JTWC downgraded it to a typhoon on October 6 as it emerged into the [[South China Sea]]. An area of [[high pressure area|high pressure]] built over [[China]], pushing Angela towards the southwest. [[Wind shear]] over the area weakened somewhat, and the typhoon re-intensified. However, as it passed south of [[Hainan]], the cyclone again weakened due to the interaction with land. At 0600 UTC on October 10, Angela struck the coast of [[Vietnam]] and moved ashore. The JTWC issued their final advisory on the system at 1200 UTC,<ref name="ATCR"/> at which time the JMA downgraded it to a severe tropical storm, to a tropical storm six hours later, and to a tropical depression early on October 11.<ref name="JMA"/>

==Preparations and impact==
On October 6, Angela prompted the issuance of the Stand By Signal No. 1 in [[Hong Kong]]. It was replaced by a Strong Wind Signal No. 3 the next day, and after the typhoon's closest approach to the region on October 8, a Strong Monsoon Signal was hoisted.<ref name="Hong Kong">{{cite web|author=|title=Tropical Cyclones in 1989|date=October 1990|publisher=Royal Observatory Hong Kong|accessdate=March 22, 2010|url=http://www.weather.gov.hk/publica/tc/tc1989.pdf}}</ref> One-hour sustained winds reached {{convert|39|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, out of the east, at [[Waglan Island]].

Angela caused severe damage in the Philippines.<ref name="ATCR"/> It is estimated that 119 people perished, and 192 more were injured. Additionally, 	28 remained missing following the storm.
