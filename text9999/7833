"'''Love a Woman'''" is a song recorded by American [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Mary J. Blige]] featuring [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]] from her tenth [[studio album]] ''[[My Life II... The Journey Continues (Act 1)]]'' (2011). It was written by [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Sean Garrett]], [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]] and Menardini Timothee while production was handled by Garrett, Team S. Dot and BridgeTown. Originally written for Knowles' fourth studio album ''[[4 (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles album)|4]]'' (2011), the singer felt that it did not fit with the sound she had created for her album, and she thought that it would be better if she recorded it as a duet with Blige instead.

"Love a Woman" is a down-tempo [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] ballad with live-instrumentation in which Knowles and Blige are teaching men about how to love their female partners. It received positive reviews from music critics who mostly praised the chemistry between Knowles and Blige on the duet as well as their vocals. Following the release of ''My Life II... The Journey Continues (Act 1)'', the song peaked at number eighty nine on the US [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] based on digital sales.

"The song was so amazing I had to be sure, as an artist, that she really was trying to give it to me. I was like 'is she really trying to give me this song, because it's pretty amazing.'
