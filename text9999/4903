==Football player==
===Santa Barbara High School===
Despite his small size (5 feet, 8&nbsp;inches and 155 pounds), Zampese played tailback for Santa Barbara High School from 1951 to 1953.  As a senior in 1953, Zampese rushed for 869 yards (9.3 yards per carry) and 19 touchdowns.  He also passed for 1008 yards and 14 passing touchdowns.<ref name=LAT/>  In December 1953, he was selected by the [[Helms Athletic Foundation]]'s football board as the CIF Player of the Year.<ref name=LAT/>  The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called him "Little Ernie Zampese, a durable workhorse who did everything well for the Santa Barbara High Dons."<ref name=LAT>{{cite news|author=John de la Vega|title=Zampese of Santa Barbara Named CIF Player of Year|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1953-12-29}}</ref>  Zampese later recalled his days playing for the Dons as follows:<blockquote>"We had a great tradition at Santa Barbara.  The stadium was on the school grounds in a little bowl.  The town was much smaller then and everyone watched the Santa Barbara Dons on Friday nights.  The epitomy of success was to play for the Santa Barbara Dons.  That was as high as you could go."<ref name=Air>{{cite news|author=Dave Distel|title=Coaches Receivers: Zampese Puts Air in Coryell Attack|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1981-10-06}}</ref></blockquote> 

===USC Trojans===
After graduating from high school, Zampese enrolled at the [[University of Southern California]].  He played left halfback for the [[USC Trojans football]] team from 1955 to 1956.<ref>{{cite news|title=Zampese to Stay at Half|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1956-04-24}}</ref>  Zampese developed a reputation as a colorful character at USC.  In a 1987 feature story, the ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote of Zampese in his college days, "Zampese was a work of art, or so the legend goes, a guy who could paint the town Trojan Red at night and be seen whistling at sunrise the next morning, a Daily Racing Form folded under his arm, a soda in one hand and a cigarette in the other. Let's just say he wasn't headed for biology class."<ref name=Class>{{cite news|author=Chris Dufresne|title=THE GREAT ZAMPESE: Rams' Offensive Coordinator Has Now Passed Into a Class by Himself|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1987-09-04|url=http://proquest.umi.com.ezproxy.lapl.org/pqdweb?did=58501149&sid=15&Fmt=3&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=PQD}}</ref>  He had his best season for the Trojans as a junior in 1956.  In the Trojan's final pre-season in September 1956, Zampese scored two rushing touchdowns and returned a punt 66 yards.  Zampese's performance led sports writer Braven Dyer to write, "A lightweight named Ernie Zampese stole the show ... Weighing less than the 160 pounds credited to him on Troy's roster, the slick Santa Barbara speedster sparked the so-called second varsity unit ..."<ref>{{cite news|author=Braven Dyer|title=Zampese Stars in SC Drill|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1956-09-16}}</ref> In addition to playing halfback, Zampese was also the punter for the 1956 Trojans team and was among the national leaders with an average of 43.9 yards per punt.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kirk Wilson Leads Punters; Zampese 3rd|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1956-11-22}}</ref>  He set the USC record for longest punt, 85 yards against Wisconsin.<ref name=Class/>

In his final college football game, Zampese ran 38 yards for a touchdown in the fourth quarter to give the Trojans a 28-20 win over Notre Dame at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]].  The ''Los Angeles Times'' concluded its coverage of the game with a tribute to Zampese, "Troy had the final word, though, and came up with the clutch play on Zampese's 38-yard run 46 seconds into the final period.  Clutch?  You bet!  It was fourth and 1 on the Notre Dame when Ernie decided to be a hero."<ref>{{cite news|author=Mal Florence|title=TROJANS DEFEAT SPIRITED IRISH, 28-20: SC's Clutch Play Clinches Triumph; Zampese's 38-Yard Scoring Run in Last Period Ruins Notre Dame|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1956-12-02}}</ref> 

Zampese was barred from competition in 1957 due to [[Pacific Coast Conference]] penalties against USC.<ref name=Ottawa/>  Zampese and other players had part-time jobs which were determined to be in violation of NCAA rules.  Zampese later recalled that the part-time job that cost him his eligibility as a senior was sweeping leaves for $1.50 an hour.  Zampese later recalled, "We did that to get extra money because you could hardly survive on what the Pacific Coast Conference allowed for scholarships.  I had to report to a groundskeeper and do whatever he did."<ref name=Air/>

Having been ruled ineligible for the 1957 season, Zampese did not complete his degree at USC.  He later recalled having academic problems in his senior year: "The thing that happened my last semester was that I never went to class. I took Incompletes and they turned to F's, and I blew the whole thing off. At that time, I wasn't real interested and I had no direction, other than having fun."<ref name=Class/>  

===Ottawa Roughriders===
In June 1958, Zampese signed a contract to play professional football for the [[Ottawa Roughriders]] in the [[Canadian Football League]], reportedly for $9,000.<ref name=Ottawa>{{cite news|title=Zampese Signs Canadian Pact|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1958-06-22}}</ref>  He was cut by the Roughriders in August 1958.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ottawa Gridders Cut Boston College Back|newspaper=The Hartford Courant|date=1958-08-13}}</ref>

==Football coach==
After being cut by the Ottawa Roughriders in the summer of 1958, Zampese took a job driving a sugar beet truck in [[Bakersfield, California]].  He then took a job as a postman in Santa Barbara, where he was married to his wife, Joyce.<ref name=Class/>  He later recalled that his wife straightened him out and urged him to return to college so that he could pursue his dream of becoming a football coach.  Zampese enrolled at [[California Polytechnic State University|Cal Poly San Luis Obispo]] and received a degree in physical education.  He recalled, "For the first time, I sat down and really did the work.  I was really proud of myself. The first year I ended up with a 3.0 average and, boy, that was big stuff."<ref name=Class/>

Zampese got his start in coaching in 1962 when he was hired by [[John Madden]] as the backfield coach at [[Allan Hancock College|Allan Hancock Junior College]] in [[Santa Maria, California]].<ref name=Air/><ref name=Class/><ref>{{cite news|author=Jack Hawn|title=QB FREITAS LEADS THE NATION: Winning Now Tradition at San Diego State|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1973-11-29}}</ref>  Zampese became the head coach at Hancock in 1964 after John Madden left to join [[Don Coryell]]'s coaching staff at [[San Diego State University]].<ref name=Class/>  The brief stint as head coach at Hancock proved to be Zampese's only head coaching experience.  Zampese later noted, "I did it once, and I wasn't good at it. Why? I don't know. I don't like to be the out-front guy. I'm not comfortable in that position."<ref name=Class/>

In 1966, Zampese moved to [[California Polytechnic State University|Cal State San Luis Obispo]] as the backfield coach.<ref name=SDSU/>  

In June 1967, he was hired by [[San Diego State University]] head coach [[Don Coryell]] as his defensive backfield coach; Zampese replaced [[John Madden]] who resigned to join the [[Oakland Raiders]] staff.<ref name=SDSU>{{cite news|title=Ernie Zampese, Ex-USC Gridder, on Aztec Staff|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1967-06-08}}</ref>  He remained an assistant coach at San Diego State from 1967 to 1975 and was one of two assistant coaches to retain his job after Coryell resigned in 1973 to join the [[Arizona Cardinals|St. Louis Cardinals]].<ref>{{cite news|title=MATSON, 3 OTHERS JOIN AZTEC STAFF|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1973-02-21}}</ref>  Zampese recalled that his years as an assistant coach at San Diego State was his first exposure to a great passing attack.<ref name=Air/>

He began his [[National Football League|NFL]] coaching career in 1976 as the defensive backs coach for head coach [[Tommy Prothro]] of the [[San Diego Chargers]].<ref name=Air/>  He spent the 1977 and 1978 seasons as a scout for the [[New York Jets]].<ref name=Air/>  

In March 1979, Zampese was reunited with Don Coryell as the wide receivers coach for the San Diego Chargers.<ref>{{cite news|author=Chris Cobbs|title=Chargers Get Message--Defense Is Needed to Win|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1983-09-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Dave Distel|title=San Diego Sports Scene|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1979-03-03}}</ref>  He coached the receivers, including Hall of Famers [[Charlie Joiner]] and [[Kellen Winslow]], from 1979 to 1983.  In 1981, the ''Los Angeles Times'' published a feature story giving the little-known Zampese much of the credit for the famed [[Air Coryell]] offense of the late 1970s and early 1980s.  The ''Times'' feature appeared under the headline, "Zampese Puts Air in Coryell Attack."<ref name=Air/>

In 1983, Zampese was promoted to assistant head coach in charge of the passing game.<ref>{{cite news|author=Chris Cobbs|title=Fouts Signs 'Highest' Contract in Pro Football|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1983-06-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author-Kurt Rosenberg|title=Looking Behind the Scenes of Air Coryell|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1984-08-26}}</ref>  In 1985, the Chargers shuffled assignments, with Zampese losing the title of assistant head coach and becoming offensive coordinator.  The ''Los Angeles Times'' in December 1985 wrote the following about Zampese's new role:<blockquote>"Fortunately for morale, Zampese is not the type to worry about what he is called.  For that matter, he probably did not even know that he was assistant head coach and undoubtedly does not care that he is now a mere offensive coordinator.  If he knows.  Zampese's only interest is in designing a high-octane offense.  All he needs is a blackboard and a projector.  He does not need a desk and he cares not what it says on the door.  He could work in a cave on Mt. Laguna and be happy."<ref>{{cite news|author=Dave Distel|title=Organizational Chart Is Even More Complex Than Charger Offense|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1985-12-25}}</ref></blockquote>

In February 1987, Zampese signed as offensive coordinator of the [[St. Louis Rams|Los Angeles Rams]].  Rams head coach [[John Robinson]] had earlier been asked who he would most like to start a new coaching staff with, and without hesitation Robinson named Zampese.  Zampese was described at the time as an "offensive genius" and "one of the most likable and most respected coaches in the league."<ref>{{cite news|author=Clark Judge|title=Zampese seeks new challenges: Levy, Theder will take over for Chargers' offensive genius|newspaper=The Tribune, San Diego, Calif.|date=1987-02-19|url=http://proquest.umi.com.ezproxy.lapl.org/pqdweb?did=1234892281&sid=15&Fmt=3&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=PQD}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Chris Cobbs|title=Zampese Takes Job With Rams Offensive Coordinator Throws Chargers for a Loss|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1987-02-19|url=http://proquest.umi.com.ezproxy.lapl.org/pqdweb?did=58243940&sid=15&Fmt=3&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=PQD}}</ref>  Zampese spent seven years with the Rams from 1987 to 1993.

From 1994 to 1997, he was the offensive coordinator for the [[Dallas Cowboys]].  In his first year in Dallas, the Cowboys' offense finished second  in the NFL in scoring with an average of 25.9 points per game.<ref name=Dallas94>{{cite web|title=1994 Dallas Cowboys|publisher=pro-football-reference.com|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/dal/1994.htm|accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>  The team finished 12-4 and advanced to the NFC championship game but lost to the [[San Francisco 49ers]].<ref name=Dallas94/>  In 1995, he was the offensive coordinator of the Cowboy's Super Bowl championship team.

In January 1998, Zampese signed as offensive coordinator with the [[New England Patriots]].<ref>{{cite news|title=FOOTBALL: Pats get their man Carroll, Kraft tab Zampese; Ernie takes offense|newspaper=Boston Herald|date=1998-01-30|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/25801139.html?dids=25801139:25801139&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+30,+1998&author=RICH+THOMPSON&pub=Boston+Herald&desc=FOOTBALL+Pats+get+their+man+Carroll,+Kraft+tab+Zampese+Ernie+takes+offense&pqatl=google}}</ref>  In Zampese's first year with New England, the Patriots averaged 21.1 points per game, 11th  best in the NFL.<ref>{{cite web|title=1998 New England Patriots|publisher=pro-football-reference.com|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nwe/1998.htm|accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>  In 1999, the Patriots' offensive output dropped to 18.7 points per game, 20th in the NFL.<ref>{{cite web|title=1999 New England Patriots|publisher=pro-football-reference.com|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nwe/1999.htm|accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>
