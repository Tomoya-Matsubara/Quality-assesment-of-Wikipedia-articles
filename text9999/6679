During the '''[[British Mandate of Palestine]]''' from 1920 until 1948, the de facto '''flag''' was the [[Union Flag]] or Union Jack of the United Kingdom, but several localized flags existed for Mandate government departments and government officials.  The only Palestine-specific flag not restricted to official government use was the Palestine ensign (red with the Union Jack in the [[canton (heraldry)|canton]], and a white circle on the fly with the mandate's name inside it), which was flown by ships registered in the British Mandate territory during the period 1927<U+2013>1948.  This flag had an extremely limited use on land, and was not embraced by either the [[Arab]]s or the [[Jew]]s of the Palestine mandate territory.  It was based on the British [[Red Ensign]] (civil ensign) instead of the  [[Blue Ensign]] (used as the basis for the flags of nearly all other British-ruled territories in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]), since it was only intended for use at sea by non-government ships.<ref>[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/mpe~c.html Civil Ensign 1927-1948 (British Mandate of Palestine)] at FOTW site</ref><ref>[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/mpe.html British Mandate of Palestine 1923-1948] at FOTW site</ref>
