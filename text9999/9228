'''Q fever''' is a disease caused by infection with <!-- why "Coxiella burnetii" when it is named by Derrick after F M Burnet and the latin possessive ending has but one i. Early original articles use "burneti", latest Bergey uses both!. Looking through the taxonomic literature, this is not the only case of a superfluous i. -->''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'',<ref name="pmid16547017">{{cite journal |author=Beare PA, Samuel JE, Howe D, Virtaneva K, Porcella SF, Heinzen RA |title=Genetic diversity of the Q fever agent, Coxiella burnetii, assessed by microarray-based whole-genome comparisons |journal=J.

This organism is uncommon but may be found in [[cow|cattle]], [[sheep]], [[goat]]s and other [[domestic mammal]]s, including [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s. The infection results from [[inhalation]] of contaminated [[Particulate|particles in the air]], and from contact with the vaginal mucus, milk, feces, urine or semen of infected animals. The [[incubation period]] is 9-40 days.  It is considered possibly the most infectious disease in the world, as a human being can be infected by a single bacterium.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/qfever/ Q fever caused by Coxiella burnetii<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== History ==
[[Image:Pneumonia_x-ray.jpg|right|thumb|''Image A'': A normal [[chest X-ray]]. ''Image B'': [[Q fever]] pneumonia.]]
It was first described by [[Edward Holbrook Derrick]]<ref>Derrick EH. ''Q" fever a new fever entity: clinical features. diagnosis, and laboratory investigation. Med J Aust. 1937;11:281-299. </ref> in [[Slaughterhouse|abattoir]] workers in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. The "Q" stands for "query" and was applied at a time when the causative agent was unknown; it was chosen over suggestions of "abattoir fever" and "Queensland rickettsial fever", to avoid directing negative connotations at either the cattle industry or the state of Queensland.<ref>{{cite book | author = Joseph E. McDade | chapter = Historical Aspects of Q Fever | title = Q Fever, Volume I: The Disease | editor = Thomas J. Marrie | publisher = CRC Press | year = 1990 | isbn = 0849359848 | page = 8}}</ref> 

The [[pathogen]] of Q fever was discovered in 1937, when [[Frank Macfarlane Burnet]] and [[Mavis Freeman]] isolated the bacterium from one of Derrick<U+2019>s patients.<ref>Burnet FM, Freeman M. Experimental studies on the virus of <U+201C>Q<U+201D> fever. Med J Aust 1937; 2: 299-305.</ref> It was originally identified as a species of ''[[Rickettsia]]''. [[H.R. Cox]] and [[Davis]] isolated it from [[tick]]s in [[Montana]], [[USA]] in 1938,<ref>Davis, G. E., and H. R. Cox. 1938. [http://www.jstor.org/pss/4582746 A filter-passing infectious agent isolated from ticks. I. Isolation from Dermacentor andersonii, reactions in animals, and filtration.] Public Health Rep. 53:2259-2282.</ref> and called it ''Rickettsia diasporica''.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} ''R. diasporica'' was considered non-pathogenic until laboratory investigators were infected;{{Fact|date=December 2007}} it was officially renamed ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'' the same year. It is a zoonotic disease whose most common animal reservoirs are cattle, sheep and goats. ''Coxiella burnetii'' is no longer regarded as closely related to [[Rickettsiae]].

== Manifestations ==
Incubation period is usually 2 to 3 weeks.
The most common manifestation is [[flu-like symptoms]] with abrupt onset of [[fever]], [[malaise]], profuse perspiration, severe [[headache]], [[myalgia]] (muscle pain), joint pain, loss of appetite, upper respiratory problems, dry cough, pleuritic pain, chills, confusion and gastro-intestinal [[symptoms]] such as [[nausea]], vomiting and [[diarrhea]]. The fever lasts approximately 7 to 14 days. 

During the course, the disease can progress to an [[atypical pneumonia]], which can result in a life threatening [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS), whereby such symptoms usually occur during the first 4 to 5 days of infection. 

Less often the Q fever causes (granulomatous) [[hepatitis]] which becomes symptomatic with malaise, fever, liver enlargement (hepatomegaly), pain in the right upper quadrant of the [[abdomen]] and [[jaundice]] (icterus). Retinal vasculitis is a rare manifestation of Q fever.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kuhne F, Morlat P, Riss I, ''et al.''|title=Is A29, B12 vasculitis caused by the Q fever agent? (''Coxiella burnetii'')|journal=J Fr Ophtalmol|year=1992|volume=15|pages=315&ndash;21|pmid=1430809|language=French}}</ref>

The chronic form of Q fever is virtually identical to [[inflammation]] of the inner lining of the heart ([[endocarditis]]),<ref name="pmid16757641">{{cite journal |author=Karakousis PC, Trucksis M, Dumler JS |title=Chronic Q fever in the United States |journal=J. Clin. Microbiol. |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=2283<U+2013>7 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16757641 |pmc=1489455 |doi=10.1128/JCM.02365-05 |url=http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16757641}}</ref> which can occur months or decades following the infection. It is usually deadly if untreated. However, with appropriate treatment the mortality falls to around 10%.

== Appearance and incidence ==
[[Image:Coxiella_burnetii_01.JPG|thumb|right|C. burnetii, the Q fever causing agent]]

The pathogenic agent is to be found everywhere except [[New Zealand]].<ref name="pmid17147957">{{cite journal |author=Cutler SJ, Bouzid M, Cutler RR |title=Q fever |journal=J. Infect. |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=313<U+2013>8 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17147957 |doi=10.1016/j.jinf.2006.10.048 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0163-4453(06)00378-1}}</ref> In Europe it appears as hepatitis rather than pneumonia as in the United States.{{fact|date=November 2008}} The bacterium is extremely sustainable and infectious: a single organism is able to cause an infection. The common way of infection is inhalation of contaminated dust, contact with contaminated [[milk]], meat, wool and particularly birthing products. Ticks can transfer the pathogenic agent to other animals. Transfer between humans seems extremely rare and has so far been described in very few cases.

Some studies have shown more men to be affected than women,<ref name="pmid10589906">{{cite journal |author=Domingo P, Mu<U+00F1>oz C, Franquet T, Gurgu<U+00ED> M, Sancho F, Vazquez G |title=Acute Q fever in adult patients: report on 63 sporadic cases in an urban area |journal=Clin.

"At risk" occupations include, but are not limited to:
* [[veterinary]] personnel
* [[stockyard]] workers
* [[farmer]]s
* [[shearer]]s 
* animal transporters
* laboratory workers handling potentially infected veterinary samples or visiting [[abattoir]]s
* people who cull and process [[kangaroos]]
* hide ([[tannery]]) workers.

== Diagnosis ==

Diagnosis is usually based on [[serology]]<ref name="pmid10515901">{{cite journal |author=Maurin M, Raoult D |title=Q fever |journal=Clin. Microbiol. Rev. |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=518<U+2013>53 |year=1999 |month=October |pmid=10515901 |pmc=88923 |doi= |url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10515901}}</ref><ref name="pmid12491231">{{cite journal |author=Scola BL |title=Current laboratory diagnosis of Q fever |journal=Semin Pediatr Infect Dis |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=257<U+2013>62 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12491231 |doi=10.1053/spid.2002.127199 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S104518700250008X}}</ref> (looking for an [[antibody]] response) rather than looking for the organism itself.  Serology allows to detect chronic infection as high antibody levels are found against the virulent form of the bacterium.  Molecular detection of bacterial DNA is increasingly used.  Culture is technically difficult and not routinely available in most microbiology laboratories. 

Q fever can cause [[endocarditis]] (infection of the heart valves) which may require [[Echocardiography#Transesophageal echocardiogram|transoesophageal echocardiography]] to diagnose.  Q fever hepatitis manifests as an elevation of [[Alanine transaminase|ALT]] and [[Aspartate transaminase|AST]], but a definitive diagnosis is only possible on [[liver biopsy]] which shows the characteristic [[fibrin ring granuloma]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Patient with fever and diarrea | author=van de Veerdonk FL, Schneeberger PM. | journal=Clin Infect Dis | year=2006 | volume=42 | pages=1051&ndash;2 | doi=10.1086/501027 }}</ref>

== Treatment ==

Treatment of the acute Q fever with [[antibiotic]]s is very effective and should take place in consultation with an [[infectious disease]]s specialist. Commonly used are [[doxycycline]], [[tetracycline]], [[chloramphenicol]], [[ciprofloxacin]], [[ofloxacin]], and [[hydroxychloroquine]]. The chronic form is more difficult to treat and can require up to four years of treatment with doxycycline and [[quinolone]]s or doxycycline with hydroxychloroquine.

Q fever in pregnancy is especially difficult to treat because doxycycline and ciprofloxacin are contraindicated in pregnancy.  The preferred treatment is five weeks of co-trimoxazole.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Clin Infect Dis|year=2007|volume=45|pages=548&ndash;555|title=Managing Q fever during pregnancy: The benefits of long-term Cctrimoxazole therapy|author=Carcopino X, Raoult D, Bretelle F, Boubli L, Stein A|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/CID/journal/issues/v45n5/51070/51070.html | doi = 10.1086/520661 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->|format={{dead link|date=June 2008}} &ndash; <sup>[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=intitle%3AManaging+Q+fever+during+pregnancy%3A+The+benefits+of+long-term+Cctrimoxazole+therapy&as_publication=Clin+Infect+Dis&as_ylo=2007&as_yhi=2007&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup>}}</ref>

== Prevention ==

Q fever is effectively prevented by intradermal vaccination with a vaccine composed of killed ''Coxiella burnetii'' organisms. Skin and blood tests should be done before vaccination to identify preexisting immunity; the reason is that vaccinating subjects who already have an immunity can result in a severe local reaction. After a single dose of vaccine, protective immunity lasts for many years. Revaccination is not generally required. Annual screening is typically recommended.<ref>[http://cdp.ucsf.edu/fileUpload/UCSF_CDP_Q_Fever_Surveillance_Policy_Q_Neg_Wethers.pdf]</ref>

In 2001, [[Australia]] introduced a national Q fever vaccination program for people working in "at risk" occupations.

== Biological warfare ==

Q fever has been described as a possible biological weapon.<ref name="pmid14592601">{{cite journal |author=Madariaga MG, Rezai K, Trenholme GM, Weinstein RA |title=Q fever: a biological weapon in your backyard |journal=Lancet Infect Dis |volume=3 |issue=11 |pages=709<U+2013>21 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=14592601 |doi= |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1473309903008041}}</ref>

The United States investigated Q fever as a potential [[biological warfare]] agent in the 1950s with eventual standardization as agent OU.  At Fort Detrick and Dugway Proving Ground human trials were conducted on Whitecoat volunteers to determine the median infective dose (18 MICLD<sub>50</sub>/person i.h.) and course of infection.  As a standardized biological it was manufactured in large quantities at Pine Bluff Arsenal, with 5,098 gallons in the arsenal in bulk at the time of demilitarization in 1970.  

Q fever is a category "B" agent.<ref name="pmid12704232">{{cite journal |author=Seshadri R, Paulsen IT, Eisen JA, ''et al'' |title=Complete genome sequence of the Q-fever pathogen Coxiella burnetii |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=100 |issue=9 |pages=5455<U+2013>60 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12704232 |pmc=154366 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0931379100 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12704232}}</ref> It can be contagious and is very stable in aerosols in a wide range of temperatures. Q fever microorganisms may survive on surfaces up to 60 days. 

The Soviet Union had a killed vaccine against it to protect animal handlers that had side effects precluding its licensing abroad.  Protection against the disease today is offered by Q-Vax, a whole cell inactivated vaccine developed by a leading Australian vaccine manufacturing company CSL.<ref>[http://www.csl.com.au/QFever.asp csl.com.au]</ref>
