'''Saguenay Fjord National Park''' (French:''parc national du Fjord-du-Saguenay '') is a [[National parks of Canada|national park]] located in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].<ref>[http://www.mddep.gouv.qc.ca/biodiversite/aires_protegees/registre/reg-design/17Parc-nationalquebec.pdf Registre des aires prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>es du Qu<U+00E9>bec], Minist<U+00E8>re du D<U+00E9>veloppement durable, de l<U+2019>Environnement et des Parcs. {{Fr icon}}</ref> Located in the [[Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean]], [[Charlevoix]], [[C<U+00F4>te-Nord]] and [[Bas-Saint-Laurent]] region, the park is situated along the eastern end of the [[Saguenay River]] and adjoins the [[Saguenay <U+2013> St. Lawrence Marine Park]] for over 100&nbsp;km (60&nbsp;mi.).<ref>http://www.quebecmaritime.ca/en/company/saguenay-national-park</ref>

The park, originally named '''Saguenay National Park,''' was renamed on April 20, 2011.<ref name=rename>[http://www.mddep.gouv.qc.ca/infuseur/communique.asp?no=1852 Le parc national du Saguenay devient le parc national du Fjord-du-Saguenay].

==History==
[[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginals]] have inhabited the Saguenay Fjord area for thousands of years prior to the first Europeans arriving. The first European to visit the area was [[Jacques Cartier]], in 1535. Between 1628 and 1842, the Saguenay economy was heavily dependent on the [[fur trade]]. In 1838, settlers began moving into the Saguenay region. Between 1840 and 1920, the region had a sizable [[lumber]] industry. By the end of the 19th, much of the forests around the [[Saguenay River]] were depleted. In addition to the depletion of the forests, difficult terrain and the decline of the lumber industry led to the Saguenay area remaining mostly undeveloped into the 20th century.<ref name=history>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090220044856/http://sepaq.com/pq/sag/en/historique.html Parc national du Fjord-du-Saguenay - History]. SEPAQ. Retrieved 12 May 2012.</ref>

Starting in 1970, the Quebec government began acquiring land around the fjord in hopes of protecting it. In 1982, the government held public on the park's design and boundaries. Saguenay National Park was officially created on June 8, 1983. In 1984, the park was [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with France's [[C<U+00E9>vennes National Park]].<ref name=history/> In 1991, facilities were added to the Baie du Moulin-<U+00E0>-Baude section, while in 2000, facilities were added to the Baie-Sainte-Marguerite section. On April 20, 2011, the park changed its name from Saguenay National Park to Saguenay Fjord National Park in order to emphasize the [[fjord]]'s distinctiveness of being one the most southerly fjords in the world.<ref name=rename/>

==Geography==

Saguenay Fjord National Park lies along the shore of its namesake [[fjord]]. The [[Saguenay<U+2013>St. Lawrence Marine Park]] lies to the southeast of the park. The park covers the following regions: [[Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean]], [[Charlevoix]], [[C<U+00F4>te-Nord]] and [[Bas-Saint-Laurent]]. Saguenay Fjord National Park's Baie-<U+00C9>ternit<U+00E9> visitor center is about {{convert|60|km|mi}} from [[Saguenay, Quebec]].<ref name=info>[http://www.sepaq.com/pq/sag/information.dot Parc national du Fjord-du-Saguenay - Information]. SEPAQ. Retrieved 13 May 2012.</ref>

Saguenay Fjord, the park's namesake, has a length of {{convert|105|km|mi}} and a width that varies between {{convert|2|km|mi}} and {{convert|4|km|mi}}. The fjord has an average depth of {{convert|210|m|ft}}, with the deepest point being {{convert|270|m|ft}}. The cliffs along the fjord have an average height of {{convert|150|m|ft}}, reaching a maximum height of {{convert|350|m|ft}}.  Saguenay Fjord flows into an [[estuary]]; [[Saline water|salt water]] from the [[St. Lawrence River]] flows under a layer of freshwater originating from [[Lac St. Jean]]. Salt water takes up 93% of the water volume inside the fjord.<ref name=journal>[http://www.sepaq.com/dotAsset/35714.pdf Parc national du Fjord-du-Saguenay 2012-2013 Journal]. SEPAQ. Retrieved 13 May 2012.</ref>

The park contains the following three regions:<ref name=info/>
*Baie-<U+00C9>ternit<U+00E9>: This southwest region is reached through the village of [[Rivi<U+00E8>re-<U+00C9>ternit<U+00E9>, Quebec|Rivi<U+00E8>re-<U+00C9>ternit<U+00E9>]].  The Saguenay Fjord Interpretation Centre is located here, and features exhibits about the formation of the [[fjord]], its geology and wildlife.
*Baie-Sainte-Marguerite: The north region near [[Sacr<U+00E9>-C<U+0153>ur, Quebec|Sacr<U+00E9>-C<U+0153>ur]] includes the Beluga Interpretation Centre. In the summer, [[beluga whales]] congregate in the bay.
*Baie du Moulin-<U+00E0>-Baude: Located around [[Tadoussac, Quebec|Tadoussac]], this is the eastern region of the park. The Maison des Dunes Interpretation Centre features exhibits about the park's [[sand dunes]], wildlife, marine life and ecosystems, and offers naturalist and fall bird-watching programs in conjunction with the Observatoire d'oiseaux de Tadoussac.

==Geology==
The geological origins of Saguenay Fjord National Park can be traced to the [[Grenville orogeny]] during the [[Precambrian]] era. This event is considered to be the beginnings to the [[Laurentian mountains]]. Around 200 million years ago, a rock basal complex between a north fault and a south fault collapsed, creating the [[Saguenay Graben]]. The [[graben]] was {{convert|250|km|mi}} long and {{convert|50|km|mi}} wide. During the [[last glacial period]], the region was covered by ice sheets two to three kilometers deep. The ice sheets cut deep into the Saguenay graben, gouging the fjord in the process. The weight of the ice sheets also caused the region to sink. When the claciers melted around 10,000 years ago, the graben was flooded by seawater. The subsequent [[post-glacial rebound]] lifted the terrain, shaping the fjord valleys in the process.<ref name=canadianatlas>[http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/atlas/themes.aspx?id=rivers&sub=rivers_east_saguenay Saguenay River (Boreal shield)]. [[Canadian Geographic]]. Retrieved 13 May 2012.</ref>

==Fauna==
Animals that can be found in the park's forests include wolves, [[black bears]], [[lynx]], [[beavers]], and [[moose]]. [[Peregrine falcons]] can be found on the fjord's cliffs. [[Harbor seal|Seals]], [[brook trout]], [[Atlantic salmon]], as well as isolated populations of [[Greenland halibut]] and [[Arctic cod]] can be found in the park's waters.<ref name=canadianatlas/><ref name=naturalenvironment>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090220050025/http://sepaq.com/pq/sag/en/raison.html Parc national du Saguenay - Conservation Mission]. SEPAQ. Retrieved 13 May 2012.</ref>

The park's waters are also home to four species of whales: the [[blue whale]], the [[fin whale]], the [[minke whale]] and the [[beluga whale]]. Saguenay Fjord's beluga whale. Due to pollution on the Saguenay river, the beluga whale population has significantly decreased in the region. This subpopulation is now considered to be [[endangered]].<ref name=canadianatlas/>

==Tourism==
Saguenay Fjord National Park had 90,550 visitors in 2005, with 90% of those visitors coming from outside the region.<ref name=visitornumbers>[http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http://www.sepaq.com/Fr/Pages/COM/popUp.cfm?no=663&title=Qu%C3%A9bec%20investit%20plus%20de%205%20M%24%20dans%20la%20r%C3%A9gion%20du%20Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean Qu<U+00E9>bec investit plus de 5 M$ dans la r<U+00E9>gion du Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean].
