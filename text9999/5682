'''Kevin Patrick O'Flanagan''' (born [[June 10]] [[1919]], [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]]; died [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Republic of Ireland]], [[May 26]] [[2006]]), also referred to as '''Dr. Kevin O'Flanagan''', is a former Irish sportsman, [[physician]] and sports administrator. An outstanding all-rounder, he represented his country at both [[football (soccer)|soccer]] and [[rugby union]]. He was also a noted [[sprinting|sprinter]] and [[long jumper]] and as a youth played [[Gaelic football]]. In his spare time he also played [[golf]] and [[tennis]] at a decent level. O'Flanagan played soccer for among others, [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], and as an international he played for both Ireland teams - the [[Ireland national football team (FAI)|FAI XI]] and the [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|IFA XI]]. O'Flanagan also played rugby union for [[University College Dublin|UCD]], [[London Irish]] and [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]].   

In 1946 he played rugby for [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] against [[France national rugby union team|France]] and then played soccer for the [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|IFA XI]] against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] seven days later. His brother, [[Mick O'Flanagan]], was also a notable sportsman and also represented Ireland at both soccer and rugby union. On September 30 1946 both brothers played together for the [[Ireland national football team (FAI)|FAI XI]] against [[England national football team|England]]. A third brother, [[Charlie O'Flanagan]], also played for Bohs.   

O'Flanagan subsequently became an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] official and served on the [[International Olympic Committee]] from 1976 to 1994. On his retirement he was made an honorary lifetime member of IOC. He died in a Dublin hospital in 2006, at the age of 86, after being admitted for [[heart]] problems. 

==Sporting career==
===Early years===
O'Flanagan attended the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] school in Synge Street, [[Dublin]] where the main sport was  Gaelic football and he was subsequently included on the [[Dublin GAA]] minor panel. The panel also included [[Johnny Carey]] and together they also played soccer with [[Home Farm F.C.|Home Farm]]. When the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] found out, O'Flanagan, but not Carey was dropped from the panel. He continued to play soccer and joined [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]], making his first team debut at 16. In the summer of 1937 he played for an [[Ireland national football team (FAI)|Ireland]] junior team against a Birmingham FA XI at [[West Bromwich]] and scored twice in a 4-3 win. His performance resulted in offers from [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], but his parents insisted that he complete his education.

===University years===
In 1937 O'Flanagan began studying medicine at [[University College Dublin]] and it was while there that he developed into an all-round sportsman. He continued to play soccer for [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] and on November 7 1937, aged 18, he scored on his senior debut for [[Ireland national football team (FAI)|Ireland]] against [[Norway national football team|Norway]], in a qualifier for the [[1938 FIFA World Cup qualification|1938 FIFA World Cup]]. In 1945 he also captained Bohs as they won the [[Dublin and Belfast Intercity Cup]], beating [[Belfast Celtic F.C.|Belfast Celtic]] 3-2 on aggregate in the final. 

It was while at UCD that O'Flanagan first took up rugby union, playing for the [[University College Dublin RFC|university team]], and in 1942 he received his first call up to the [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] squad. O'Flanagan also emerged as a prominent [[Athletics (track and field)|athlete]] and was Irish long jump champion in 1939 and the 60 yards and 100 yards champion in 1941. In 1941 he tied with David Guiney for the long jump title, but with only one gold medal available, he insisted his rival accept it as he already had one. Only the [[Second World War]] prevented O'Flanagan representing Ireland at a third sport. 

===London years===
After qualifying as a doctor from [[University College Dublin|UCD]] in 1945, O'Flanagan was offered a position as a junior [[General practitioner|GP]] in [[Ruislip]], [[Middlesex]]. He maintained his interest in sport, however, playing soccer for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and rugby union for [[London Irish]]. Despite being good enough to play soccer as a professional, he remained an amateur so he could continue to play rugby union. In his debut season with Arsenal, [[1945-46 in English football|1945-46]], he scored 11 goals in 18 [[Football League South]] appearances, finishing as the club<U+2019>s top scorer; he also played a further two games for Arsenal in the [[FA Cup]] in a two-legged tie against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] that Arsenal lost 6-1 on aggregate.

During the [[1946-47 in English football|1946-47]] season he made 14 [[Football League First Division|First Division]] appearances and scored 3 goals. He made his first-class league debut<ref>Appearances in wartime leagues such as the [[Football League South]] are not counted as official first-class matches by statisticians, hence this is considered O'Flanagan's first-class league debut.</ref> against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on September 4 1946. His last appearance for the Arsenal senior team came on December 28 1946 against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]]. He continued to play for [[Arsenal F.C. Reserves|Arsenal Reserves]] until 1948 and later played for both [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] and [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] before his increasing medical commitments and an ankle injury, forced him to retire as a sportsman in 1949. However O'Flanagan, who was now a specialist in sports medicine, had already embarked on his next career. A chance encounter with [[the Football Association|FA]] chairman [[Stanley Rous]] led to his appointment to the British Olympic Medical Commission and to him becoming team doctor for [[Great Britain at the Olympics|Great Britain]] at the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Olympic Games]].

==Irish international==
===Soccer international===
When O'Flanagan began his international [[football (soccer)|soccer]] career in 1937 there were, in effect, two Ireland teams, chosen by two rival associations. Both associations, the [[Northern Ireland]] - based [[Irish Football Association|IFA]] and the [[Irish Free State]] - based [[Football Association of Ireland|FAI]] claimed jurisdiction over the whole of [[Ireland]] and selected players from the whole island. As a result several notable Irish players from this era, including O'Flanagan, played for both teams.

Between 1937 and 1947 O'Flanagan made 10 appearances and scored 3 goals for the [[Ireland national football team (FAI)|FAI XI]]. He won 7 of these caps while playing for [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] and made his international debut against [[Norway national football team|Norway]] on November 7 1937, in a qualifier for the [[1938 FIFA World Cup qualification|1938 FIFA World Cup]]. O'Flanagan scored in the 3-3 draw. His team mates on the day included fellow debutant, [[Johnny Carey]] and  [[Jimmy Dunne]]. The highlight of his international career came when he scored twice in a 2-2 away draw against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] on May 18 1939. With Hungary 1-0 up at half-time, O'Flanagan turned the game around with two magnificent goals in the 52nd and 77th minutes. He scored the first with his left foot from twenty five yards and the second with his right foot from a similar distance.  Only a very late goal denied the FAI XI victory.

In 1939 O'Flanagan also played twice for the [[League of Ireland XI]], helping them to 2-1 victories against an [[Irish League XI]] and a [[Scottish League XI]]. He won his last three caps for the FAI XI while at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. These included the game against [[England national football team|England]] on September 30 1946 when his team mates included his brother, [[Mick O'Flanagan]]. He made his final appearance for the FAI XI on May 4 1947 in 2-0 defeat against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]. In 1946, while at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], O'Flanagan also played in two Victory internationals for the [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|IFA XI]]. On February 2 at [[Windsor Park]] he played for the IFA XI in a 3-2 defeat to [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. Then on May 4 he helped the IFA XI defeat [[Wales national football team|Wales]] 1-0 at [[Ninian Park]].

===Rugby international===
In 1942, while playing for [[University College Dublin|UCD]], O'Flanagan played for an [[Ireland national rugby union team|Irish XV]] against a [[British Army XV]] at [[Ravenhill Stadium|Ravenhill]]. In 1946, while with [[London Irish]], he played on the wing in an unofficial international against [[France national rugby union team|France]]. In 1947 he won his only official cap in a Test against [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], a 16-3 defeat at [[Lansdowne Road]].

==Sports administrator and doctor==
O'Flanagan returned to [[Dublin]] in the 1950s and established a successful practice at Upper Fitzwilliam Street. He briefly revived his soccer career with [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] and remained involved in sport throughout the rest of his life. During subsequent decades he served on numerous bodies and held various positions in the areas of sports and medicine. These include:
