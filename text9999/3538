'''Physical fitness''' is a general state of [[health]] and well-being or specifically the ability to perform aspects of [[Outline of sports|sports]] or occupations. Physical fitness is generally achieved through correct [[nutrition]], [[Physical exercise|exercise]], [[hygiene]] and rest. It is a set of attributes or characteristics that people have or achieve that relates to the ability to perform physical activity.

Before the industrial revolution, ''fitness'' was the capacity to carry out the day<U+2019>s activities without undue fatigue. However with automation and changes in lifestyles ''physical fitness'' is now considered a measure of the body<U+2019>s ability to function efficiently and effectively in work and leisure activities, to be [[health]]y, to resist [[hypokinetic diseases]], and to meet emergency situations.<ref>{{cite web|title = President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports Definitions for Health, Fitness, and Physical Activity|url = http://www.fitness.gov/digest_mar2000.htm|archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.fitness.gov/digest_mar2000.htm|archivedate=August 25, 2012}}</ref>

A comprehensive fitness program tailored to an individual typically focuses on one or more specific skills,<ref>{{cite web|title=Skill-related physical fitness essential for sports success|url=http://www.tradoc.army.mil/pao/Web_specials/H_and_PWB/013204.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110617084150/http://www.tradoc.army.mil/pao/Web_specials/H_and_PWB/013204.htm|archivedate=June 2011}}</ref> and on age-<ref>{{cite web|title = The elderly have specific fitness requirements|url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/20020201/419.html}}</ref> or health-related needs such as bone health.<ref>{{cite web|title=A targeted fitness program can increase Bone Integrity|url = http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Bone/Bone_Health/Exercise/default.asp}}</ref>  Many sources{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} also cite [[mental health|mental]], [[social health|social]] and [[emotional health]] as an important part of overall fitness. This is often presented in textbooks as a [[triangle]] made up of three points, which represent physical, emotional, and mental fitness. Physical fitness can also prevent or treat many chronic health conditions brought on by unhealthy [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] or aging.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/physicalactivity/| title = US Department of Health and Human Services Presentation: Physical Activity Fundamental to Preventing Disease}}</ref> Working out can also help people sleep better. To stay healthy it is important to engage in physical activity.<ref>{{cite web| title = How much physical activity do adults need?| url = http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/adults.html| authorlink = CDC}}</ref>

The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] encourages the adult public, ages 18 to 64, to engage each week in at least one and a quarter hours of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity or two and a half hours of moderate-intensity aerobic activity; that time can be met in any increments.<ref>{{cite web | title=How much physical activity do adults need?  | work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | url=http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/adults.html | date=2011-12-01  | accessdate=2013-04-29 }}</ref>

Diet is an important component to overall health that works best in combination with exercise.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} A balanced diet and exercising regularly are important for maintaining good health. Obesity is defined as body mass index, a measure of weight in relationship to height (Blair, 1993). With obesity on the rise, the U.S. has implemented more exercise and diet plans. There are millions of programs, websites, television shows, magazines, and movies regarding health and fitness. Recently, the trends of diets and lifestyle habits have become more and more encouraged. Understanding the importance of the health benefits resulted from diet and exercise will help decrease the amount of obesity in this country. Physical activity and exercise is defined in terms of type, intensity, duration and frequency (Blair, 1993).<ref>Blair, S. N. (1993). C. H. McCloy Research Lecture: Physical Activity, Physical Fitness, and Health. Research Quarterly For Exercise and Sport, 365-376.</ref>

Developing research has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ. That is, contracting muscles release multiple substances known as [[myokine]]s which promote the growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and various anti-inflammatory functions, which in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases.<ref>Muscles, exercise and obesity: skeletal muscle as a secretory organ. Pedersen BK; Febbraio MA: Nat Rev Endocrinol 2012; 8(8): 457-465.</ref>

==Training==
Specific or task-oriented fitness is a person's ability to perform in a specific activity with a reasonable efficiency: for example, sports or [[military service]]. Specific training prepares athletes to perform well in their sports.

Examples are:
* [[100 m sprint]]: in a sprint the athlete must be trained to work anaerobically throughout the race, an example of how to do this would be interval training.
* [[Marathon]]: in this case the athlete must be trained to work aerobically and their endurance must be built-up to a maximum.
* Many fire fighters and police officers undergo regular [[Physical fitness test|fitness testing]] to determine if they are capable of the physically demanding tasks required of the job.<ref>{{cite web|title = Physical Fitness requirements for Santa Clara County firefighters| url = http://www.sccfd.org/physical_fitness.html#appendix2}}</ref>
* Members of [[armed forces]] will often be required to pass a formal fitness test - for example soldiers of the [[US Army]] must be able to pass the [[Army Physical Fitness Test]] (APFT).<ref>{{cite web|title=APFT Requirements|url =http://www.army.com/enlist/APFT.html}}</ref>
* Hill sprints: requires a level of fitness to begin with, the exercise is particularly good for the leg muscles. The army often trains doing mountain climbing and races.

In order for physical fitness to benefit the health of an individual, an unknown response in the person called a stimulus will be triggered by the exertion. When exercise is performed with the correct amount of intensity, duration and frequency, a significant amount of improvement can occur. The person will overall feel better but the physical effects on the human body take weeks, months, or even years to be noticed or fully developed. For training purposes, exercise must provide a stress or demand on either a function or tissue. To continue improvements, this demand must eventually increase little over an extended period of time. This sort of exercise training has three basic principles: overload, specificity, and progression.  These principles are related to health but also enhancement of physical working capacity (Blair, 1993).

==Menopause and Physical Fitness==
The menopausal period in women is frequently associated with many subjective complaints including vasomotor symptoms, sleep disturbance, alteration in mood, lowered libido, and musculoskeletal pain. All of these symptoms could lead to a lower quality of life. Physical Fitness has the ability to alleviate or even eliminate the effect of most of these. Women experiencing their menopausal period should engage in regular exercise to achieve better physical fitness.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Allison MD|title=Menopause and physical fitness|journal=The North American Menopause Society|date=September<U+2013>October 2009|volume=16|issue=5|pages=856<U+2013>857|accessdate=19 August 2012}}</ref>
