'''Corfu''' ({{lang-el|<U+039A><U+03AD><U+03C1><U+03BA><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03B1>}}, ''K<U+00E9>rkyra'', {{IPA-el|<U+02C8>cercira|}}; {{lang-grc|<U+039A><U+03AD><U+03C1><U+03BA><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03B1> or <U+039A><U+03CC><U+03C1><U+03BA><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03B1>}}; {{lang-la|Corcyra}}; {{lang-it|Corf<U+00F9>}}) is a [[Greece|Greek]] [[list of islands of Greece|island]] in the [[Ionian Sea]]. It is the second largest of the [[Ionian Islands]].<ref name="Independent"/> The island is part of the [[Corfu (peripheral unit)|Corfu peripheral unit]], and is administered as a single municipality. The municipality includes the island Corfu and the smaller islands [[Ereikoussa]], [[Mathraki]] and [[Othonoi]]. The principal town of the island and seat of the municipality (pop. 33,886) is also named [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]].<ref name=Kallikratis>[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}</ref> Corfu is home to the [[Ionian University]].

The island is connected to the [[history of Greece]] from the beginning of [[Greek mythology]]. Its Greek [[name]], ''Kerkyra'' or ''[[Korkyra]]'', is related to two powerful water symbols: [[Poseidon]], god of the sea, and [[Asopus|Asopos]], an important Greek mainland river.<ref name="Greek Mythology">{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheKorkyra.html |title=Greek Mythology Encyclopedia |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-29}}</ref>  According to myth, Poseidon fell in love with the beautiful nymph [[Korkyra]], daughter of Asopus and river nymph [[Metope (mythology)|Metope]], and abducted her.<ref name="Greek Mythology"/> Poseidon brought Korkyra to the hitherto unnamed island and, in marital bliss, offered her name to the place: ''Korkyra'',<ref name="Greek Mythology"/> which gradually evolved to ''Kerkyra'' ([[Doric Greek|Doric]]).<ref name="History of Corfu from Corfu City Hall website"/> Together, they had a child they called ''Phaiax'', after whom the inhabitants of the island were named: ''[[Scheria|Phaiakes]]''. This term was transliterated via [[Latin]] to Phaeacians.

The island's history is laden with battles and conquests. The legacy of these struggles is visible in the form of castles punctuating strategic locations across the island. Two of these castles enclose its capital, which is the only city in Greece to be surrounded in such a way. As a result, Corfu's capital has been officially declared  a ''Kastropolis'' ("castle city") by the Greek government.<ref name="History of Corfu from Corfu City Hall website">{{cite web|url=http://www.corfu.gr/en/history.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080106230616/http://www.corfu.gr/en/history.htm |archivedate=2008-01-06|title=Corfu City Hall website|work=City of Corfu|quote=In literature, apart from the Homeric name Scheria, we meet various other names for the island, like Drepan<U+00EB> or Arpi, Makris, Cassopaea, Argos, Keravnia,Phaeacia, Corkyra or Kerkyra (in Doric), Gorgo or Gorgyra and much later the medieval names Corypho or Corfoi, because of the two characteristic rock-peaks of the Old Fortress of Corfu.}}</ref> Corfu was long controlled by [[Venetian Republic|Venice]], which repulsed several [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] sieges, before falling under [[United Kingdom|British]] rule following the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Corfu was eventually ceded by the British Empire along with the remaining islands of the [[United States of the Ionian Islands]], and unification with [[Kingdom of Greece|modern Greece]] was concluded in 1864 under the [[Treaty of London (1864)|Treaty of London]].

In 2007, the city's old town was designated for the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]], following a recommendation by [[International Council on Monuments and Sites|ICOMOS]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6248244.stm |title=on UNESCO World Heritage List |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-06-28 |accessdate=2009-06-29}}</ref><ref name="ICOMOS">[http://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/978.pdf UNESCO Advisory Body ([[International Council on Monuments and Sites|ICOMOS]]) report on Corfu History retrieved 3 July 2007]</ref><ref name="UNESCO">{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/978/ |title=Old Town of Corfu on UNESCO website retrieved 3 July 2007 |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-29}}</ref>

Corfu is a very popular tourist destination.<ref>Duncan Garwood, Mediterranean Europe, 2009</ref><ref>Russell King, John Connell, Small worlds, global lives: islands and migration, 1999</ref> Up until the early 20th century, it was mainly visited by the European royals and elites, including Emperor [[Wilhelm II of Germany]] and Empress [[Elisabeth of Austria]]; today it is also widely visited by middle class families, (primarily from the [[UK]], [[Scandinavia]] and [[Germany]]) leading to mass tourism.<ref>Paris Tsartas, Tourism Development in Greek Insular and Coastal Areas, 2003</ref> It is still popular with the global elite however, and in the island's northeast the homeowners include members of the [[Rothschild family]] and Russian oligarchs.<ref>Nick Foster, Financial Times, Ionian rhapsody June 17, 2011 [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/6c408b7a-94ef-11e0-a648-00144feab49a.html#axzz1Z61QKNGN]</ref><ref>Daily Telegraph, November 3, 2008[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/sunandsea/3330651/Corfu-is-all-about-fun-not-funds-Greek-Islands.html]</ref>
==Geography==
[[File:Corfu topographic map-en.svg|thumb|250px|Map of Corfu. Its satellite islands of [[Ereikousa]], [[Othoni]] and [[Mathraki]] counterclockwise NW, WNW and W respectively (with respect to the northern part of the island at the top of the map) and [[Paxoi]] and [[Antipaxoi]] on the SE side, are visible.]]

Its north-eastern coastline lies off the [[coast]] of [[Sarand<U+00EB>]], [[Albania]], from which it is separated by straits varying in width from 3 to 23&nbsp;km (2 to 15&nbsp;mi), while the south-east side of the island lies off the coast of [[Thesprotia]], [[Greece]]. The name "Corfu", an [[Italian language|Italian]] version of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] <U+039A><U+03BF><U+03C1><U+03C5><U+03C6><U+03CE> (Koryph<U+014D>), meaning "city of the peaks", derives from the Greek <U+039A><U+03BF><U+03C1><U+03C5><U+03C6><U+03B1><U+03AF> (Koryphai) (crests or peaks), denoting the two peaks of ''Palaio Frourio''.<ref name="History of Corfu from Corfu City Hall website"/>  In shape it is like the [[sickle]] (''drepan<U+0113>, <U+03B4><U+03C1><U+03B5><U+03C0><U+03AC><U+03BD><U+03B9>''), to which it was compared by the ancients: the concave side, with the town and harbour of Corfu in the centre, lies toward the Albanian coast. With the island's area estimated at {{convert|227|sqmi|km2|0}}, it runs approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} long, with greatest breadth at around {{convert|20|mi|km|0}}.

Two high and well-defined ranges divide the island into three districts, of which the northern is mountainous, the central undulating, and the southern low-lying. The more important of the two ranges, that of Pantokrator (<U+03A0><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03BA><U+03C1><U+03AC><U+03C4><U+03C9><U+03C1> - the ancient Istone) stretches east and west from Cape Falacro to Cape Psaromita, and attains its greatest elevation in the summit of the same name.

[[File:Aghios Georgios Bay in Corfu.JPG|thumb|left|250px| Bay of St. George in northwestern Corfu]]

The second range culminates in the mountain of Santi Jeca, or Santa Decca, as it is called by misinterpretation of the Greek designation ''<U+0386><U+03B3><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03B9> <U+0394><U+03AD><U+03BA><U+03B1>'' (Hagioi Deka), or the Ten Saints. The whole island, composed as it is of various limestone formations, presents great diversity of surface, and views from more elevated spots are magnificent. Beaches are found in Agios Gordis, the [[Korission lagoon]], Agios Georgios, Marathia, Kassiopi, Sidari, Palaiokastritsa and many others. Corfu is located near the [[Kefalonia]] geological fault formation; earthquakes have occurred. Corfu town and countryside have not lost the traditional architecture from the 16th century.

Corfu's coastline spans {{convert|217|km|mi|0}} including capes; its highest point is [[Mount Pantokrator]] ({{convert|906|m|ft|0}}); and the second Stravoskiadi, at {{convert|849|m|ft|0}}. The full extent of capes and promentories take in Agia Aikaterini, Drastis to the north, Lefkimmi and Asprokavos to the southeast, and Megachoro to the south. Two islands are also to be found at a middle point of Gouvia and Corfu Bay, which extends across much of the eastern shore of the island; are known as Lazareto and Ptychia (or Vido). Camping areas can be found in [[Palaiokastritsa]], [[Agrillia]], with four in the northern part, [[Pyrgi]], [[Roda, Corfu|Roda]], [[Gouvia]] and [[Messonghi]].

===Flora===
[[Homer]] identifies seven plants that adorn the garden of [[Alcinous]]: wild olive, oil olive, [[pear]], [[pomegranate]], [[apple]], [[ficus|fig]] and [[Vitis vinifera|grape vine]].  Of these the apple and the pear are {{as of | 2011}} very inferior{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} in Corfu; the others thrive, together with all the fruit trees known in southern [[Europe]], with addition of the [[kumquat]], [[loquat]] and [[opuntia|prickly pear]] and, in some spots, the [[banana]]. When undisturbed by cultivation, the [[Myrtus|myrtle]], [[arbutus]], [[bay leaf|bay]] and [[holm oak]] form a rich brushwood, and the minor flora of the island are extensive.

===Old town===
{{Main|Corfu (city)}}
[[File:KerkyraDimarheio.jpg.JPG|thumb|250px|Corfu City Hall (previously: [[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corf<U+00F9>]]).]]
The town of [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]] stands on the broad part of a peninsula, whose termination in the Venetian [[citadel]] ({{lang-el|<U+03A0><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03B9><U+03CC> <U+03A6><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03CD><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03BF>}}) is cut off from it by an artificial [[moat|fosse]] formed in a natural gully, with a seawater moat at the bottom, that now serves as a [[marina]] and is called the ''Contrafossa''. The old town, having grown within fortifications, where every metre of ground was precious, is a labyrinth of narrow streets paved with cobblestones, sometimes tortuous but colourful and clean. These streets are known as ''kanto<U+00FA>nia'' ({{lang-el|<U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03CD><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03B1>}}), and the older amongst them  sometimes follow the gentle irregularities of the ground; while many are too narrow for vehicular traffic. A promenade rises by the seashore towards the bay of Garitsa (<U+0393><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+03C4><U+03C3><U+03B1>), together with an esplanade between the town and the citadel known as ''Spianada'' with the {{ill|it|Liston (square){{!}}Liston|Liston}} arcade ({{lang-el|<U+039B><U+03B9><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03CC><U+03BD>}}) to its west side, where restaurants and  bistros abound.<ref name="Independent">[http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/holidays/family-holidays/the-complete-guide-to-corfu-851348.html The Independent] Complete Guide to Corfu</ref>

===Palaio Frourio===
[[File:Palaio Frourio in Corfu.PNG|thumb|250px|Palaio Frourio south elevation. The Venetian built [[moat]] is on the left and the Doric style St. George's Church built by the British can be seen in the background on the right.]]

The ''old citadel'' (in Greek ''Palaio Frourio'' (<U+03A0><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03B9><U+03CC> <U+03A6><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03CD><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03BF>)) is an old Venetian fortress built on an artificial islet with fortifications surrounding its entire perimeter, although some sections, particularly on the east side, are slowly being eroded and falling into the sea. Nonetheless, the interior has been restored  and is in use for cultural events, such as concerts (<U+03C3><U+03C5><U+03BD><U+03B1><U+03C5><U+03BB><U+03AF><U+03B5><U+03C2>) and Sound and Light Productions (<U+0397><U+03C7><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03B9> <U+03A6><U+03C9><U+03C2>), when historical events are recreated using sound and light special effects. These events take place amidst the ancient fortifications, with the Ionian sea in the background. The central high point of the citadel rises like a giant natural [[obelisk]] complete with a military observation post at the top, with a giant [[#Early history|cross]] at its apex; at the foot of the observatory lies St. George's church, in a classical style punctuated by six [[Doric Order|Doric]] columns,<ref name="St. George">[http://www.igougo.com/planning/journalEntryActivity.asp?EntryID=27782 St. George Article]</ref> as opposed to the [[Hagia Sophia|Byzantine]] architectural style of the greater part of Greek Orthodox churches. (built during British rule as military Anglican church)

===Neo Frourio===
The ''new citadel'' or ''Neo Frourio'' (<U+039D><U+03AD><U+03BF> <U+03A6><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03CD><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03BF>, "New Fortress") is a huge complex of fortifications dominating  the northeastern part of the city; the huge walls of the fortress dominate the landscape as one makes the trip from ''Neo Limani'' (<U+039D><U+03AD><U+03BF> <U+039B><U+03B9><U+03BC><U+03AC><U+03BD><U+03B9>, "New Port") to the town, taking the road that passes through the fishmarket (<U+03C8><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03B3><U+03BF><U+03C1><U+03AC>). The new citadel was until recently a restricted area due to the presence of a naval garrison, but old restrictions have been lifted and it is now open to the public, with  tours possible through the maze of medieval corridors and fortifications. The winged Lion of [[St Mark]], the symbol of Venice, can be seen at regular intervals adorning the fortifications.

===Ano and Kato Plateia and the music pavilion===
[[File:Maitland Monument in Corfu.JPG|thumb|The Maitland Monument in Corfu, built to commemorate [[Sir Thomas Maitland]]]]
Near the old Venetian Citadel  a large square called ''Spianada'' is also to be found, divided by a street in two parts: "Ano Plateia" (literally: "Upper square") and "Kato Plateia" (literally: "Lower square"), (<U+0391><U+03BD><U+03C9> <U+03A0><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03B5><U+03AF><U+03B1> and <U+039A><U+03AC><U+03C4><U+03C9> <U+03A0><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03B5><U+03AF><U+03B1> in Greek). This is the  biggest square in South-Eastern Europe and one of the largest in Europe,<ref>[http://www.corfulife.co.uk/corfutown.html Corfu Life UK] Quote: "The French were the ones who turned the Spianada into a public square and park - one of the biggest in Europe"</ref><ref>[http://www.sognefk.no/viktige%20filer/BROCHURE%20OF%20KERKYRA%20CUP%20IN%20ENGLISH.pdf Brohure of Kerkyra] Quote: "SOCCER The tournament will start on Wednesday 04 of July An Open Ceremony and a parade of all the teams will take place in the biggest square in the Balkansand one of themost impressive ones in the whole continent, to the square Spianada itself which is constructed similarlyto the Royal Gardens of Europe."</ref> and replete with green spaces and interesting structures, such as a Roman-style rotunda from the era of British administration, known as the ''Maitland monument'', built to commemorate [[Sir Thomas Maitland]]. An ornate music pavilion is also present, where the local "Philharmonikes" (Philharmonic Orchestras) (<U+03A6><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03BC><U+03BF><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03AD><U+03C2>), mount classical performances in the artistic and musical tradition for which the island is well-known. "Kato Plateia" also serves as a venue where [[cricket]] matches are held from time to time. In Greece, cricket is unique to Corfu, as it was once  a British protectorate.

===Palaia Anaktora and gardens===
[[File:Palaia Anaktora in Corfu.JPG|thumb|250px|The Palace of Sts. Michael and George (Palaia Anaktora). The gardens are to the right of the statue immediately after the arch to its right. The statue of Sir [[Frederick Adam]], a British governor of Corfu, is at the front.]]

Just to the north of "Kato Plateia" lie the "Palaia Anaktora" (<U+03A0><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03B9><U+03AC> <U+0391><U+03BD><U+03AC><U+03BA><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C1><U+03B1>: literally "Old Palaces"): a large complex of buildings of Roman architectural style used in the past to house the King of Greece, and prior to that the [[List of Lord High Commissioners of the Ionian Islands|British Governors]] of the island. Today they are open to the public and  form a complex of halls and buildings housing art exhibits, including a [[Museum of Asian Art (Corfu)|Museum of Asian Art]], unique across [[Southern Europe]] in its scope and in the richness of its Chinese and Asian exhibits. The gardens of the Palaces, complete with old Venetian stone aquariums, exotic trees and flowers, overlook the bay through old Venetian fortifications and turrets, and the local sea baths (<U+039C><U+03C0><U+03AC><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03B1> <U+03C4>' <U+0391><U+03BB><U+03AD><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C5>) are at the foot of the fortifications surrounding the gardens. A caf<U+00E9> on the grounds includes its own [[art gallery]], with exhibitions of both local and international artists, known locally as the Art Caf<U+00E9>. From the same spot, the viewer can observe ships passing through the narrow channel of the historic [[Vido|Vido island]] (<U+039D><U+03B7><U+03C3><U+03AF> <U+0392><U+03AF><U+03B4><U+03BF><U+03C5>) to the north, on their way to Corfu harbour (<U+039D><U+03AD><U+03BF> <U+039B><U+03B9><U+03BC><U+03AC><U+03BD><U+03B9>), with high speed retractable [[aerofoil]] ferries from [[Igoumenitsa]] also cutting across the panorama. A  wrought-iron aerial staircase is also to be found, closed to garden visitors, descending to the sea from the gardens, and used by the Greek Royal family as a shortcut to the baths. Rewriting history, locals now refer to the old Royal Gardens as the "Garden of the People" (<U+039F> <U+039A><U+03AE><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C5> <U+039B><U+03B1><U+03BF><U+03CD>).

===The old city and Pontikonisi===
[[File:Kipos tou Laou in Corfu.JPG|thumb|250px|The Garden of the People at the Palaia Anaktora. The Ionian Sea and Vido island in the background]]

In several parts of the old city houses from the [[Venice|Venetian]] era are to be found. The old city's  architectural character is strongly influenced by the Venetian style, coming as it did under Venetian rule for a long period; its small and ancient sidestreets, and the old buildings' trademark arches are particularly reminiscent of [[Venice]]. Of the thirty-seven Greek churches, the most important are the city's cathedral, the church dedicated to Our Lady of the Cave (<U+03B7> <U+03A0><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03B1><U+03B3><U+03AF><U+03B1> <U+03A3><U+03C0><U+03B7><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03CE><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03C3><U+03C3><U+03B1> (h<U+0113> Panagia Sp<U+0113>li<U+014D>tissa)); [[Saint Spyridon]] church, wherein lies the preserved body of the patron saint of the island; and finally the suburban church of St Jason and St Sosipater (<U+0391><U+03B3><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03B9> <U+0399><U+03AC><U+03C3><U+03C9><U+03BD> <U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03B9> <U+03A3><U+03C9><U+03C3><U+03AF><U+03C0><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2>), reputedly the oldest in the island, and named after the two saints probably the first to preach [[Christianity]] to the Corfiots. The nearby island, known as Pontikonisi (Greek meaning "mouse island"), though small is very green with abundant trees, and at its highest natural elevation (excluding its trees or man-made structures, such as the monastery), stands at about {{convert|2|m|2|abbr=on}}. Pontikonisi is home of the monastery of Pantokrator (<U+039C><U+03BF><U+03BD><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03AE><U+03C1><U+03B9> <U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C5> <U+03A0><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03BA><U+03C1><U+03AC><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2>); it is the white stone staircase of the monastery that when viewed from afar gives the impression of a (mouse) tail which lent the island its name: 'mouse island'.

===Othoni and Ereikoussa===
[[Othoni]] (<U+039F><U+03B8><U+03C9><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03AF>) is the westernmost settlement and island in all Greece; [[Ereikoussa]] is the northernmost of the Ionian Islands, and all areas lie below the 40<U+00B0> N. About a quarter of the villages' names end with -ades, while some villages outside Corfu also include names ending in -ades, especially those in the prefecture of Ioannina on mainland Greece, exactly opposite the southern end of Corfu. Villages at the southern end, and on the [[Paxoi]] islands, also feature names ending with -atika  or -eika, notably Gramateika.

===Lazaretto Island===
[[Lazaretto island (Corfu)|Lazaretto Island]], formerly known as Aghios Dimitrios, is located two nautical miles [[Ordinal direction|northeast]] of [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]]; the island has an area of 17.5 [[acres]] and comes under the administration  of the Greek National Tourist Organization. During Venetian rule in the early 16th century, a monastery was built on the islet and a leprosarium established later in the century, after which the island was named. In 1798, during the French occupation, the islet was occupied by the [[Russia|Russo]]-[[Turkey|Turkish]] fleet, who ran it  as a military hospital. During the British occupation, in 1814, the leprosarium was once again opened after renovations, and following Enosis in 1864 the leprosarium again saw occasional use.<ref name="koine"/> During [[World War II]], the [[Axis Occupation of Greece]] established a [[concentration camp]] there for the prisoners of the [[Greek Resistance|Greek National Resistance movement]],<ref name="Travel to Corfu"/> while  remaining today are the two-storied building that served as the Headquarters of the Italian army, a small church, and the wall against which those condemned to death were shot.<ref name="koine">{{cite web|url=http://koine.terapad.com/index.cfm?fa=contentNews.newsDetails&newsID=10608&from=list|title=Corfu honored with a new museum |publisher=Koine.terapad.com|accessdate=2009-06-29}}</ref><ref name="Travel to Corfu">{{cite web|url=http://www.travel-to-corfu.com/page.php?id=46&back=corfu.php|title=Travel to Corfu |publisher=Travel to Corfu|accessdate=2009-06-29}}</ref>

==Archaeology and architecture==
===An architectural overview: From classical to modern===
[[File:Corfu Harbor 1890.jpg|thumb|The Harbour of Corfu in 1890]]
Corfu contains a few very important remains of [[Ancient history|antiquity]]. The site of the ancient city of Corcyra (Kerkyra) is well ascertained, about {{convert|1.5|mi|km|0}} to the south-east of Corfu, upon the narrow piece of ground between the sea-lake of [[Halikiopoulo]] and the Bay of Castrades, in each of which it had a port. The circular tomb of [[Menekrates]], with its well-known inscription, is on the Bay of Castrades. Under the hill of Ascension are the remains of a temple, popularly called of [[Poseidon]], a very simple [[dome]] structure, which still in its mutilated state presents some peculiarities of [[architecture]]. Of [[Cassiope]], the only other city of ancient importance, the name is still preserved by the village of Cassiopi, and there are some rude remains of building on the site; but the temple of [[Zeus]] Cassius for which it was celebrated has totally disappeared. Throughout the island  numerous monasteries and other buildings of Venetian erection are to be found, of which the best known are Paleokastritsa, San Salvador and Peleka. The ''Achilleion'' is a palace commissioned by [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Elisabeth of Austria]] and purchased in 1907 by [[Wilhelm II of Germany]]; it is now a popular [[tourist attraction]].

===Italianate architecture===
[[Corfu (city)|Corfu Town]] is famous for its Italianate architecture, most notably the {{ill|it|Liston (square){{!}}Liston|Liston}} an arched colonnade lined with cafes on the edge of the ''Spianada'' (Esplanade), the vast main plaza and park which incorporates a [[cricket]] field and several pavilions. Also notable are the Venetian-Roman style [[#Old town|City Hall]], the Old and New castles, the recently restored Palace of Sts. Michael and George, formerly the residence of the British governor and the seat of the [[Ionian Senate]], and the summer Palace of ''Mon Repos'', formerly the property of the Greek royal family and birthplace of the [[Duke of Edinburgh]]. The Park of Mon Repos is adjacent to the Palaiopolis of Kerkyra, where excavations were conducted by the Greek Archaeological Service in collaboration with the University of Louvain-la-Neuve in Belgium, and Brown University in the United States.

Examples of the finds can be found in the Museum of the Palace of Mon Repos.<ref name="Artifacts">R. Winkes (editor), Kerkyra. Artifacts from the Palaiopolis, Providence 2004.</ref>

=== Destructions of Architecture brought about by World War II===
During World War II, the island was bombed by the German airforce, resulting in the destruction of most of the town's buildings, including its market (<U+03B1><U+03B3><U+03BF><U+03C1><U+03AC>) and Hotel Bella Venezia. The worst architectural losses of the [[Luftwaffe]] bombardment were the splendid buildings of the [[Ionian Academy]] (<U+0399><U+03CC><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+0391><U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03B4><U+03B7><U+03BC><U+03AF><U+03B1>), and the Municipal Theatre (which in 1901 had replaced the ''Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo'').  The [[Roman architecture|Roman style]] Theatre (<U+0398><U+03AD><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03BD>) of the city was later replaced by a bland, modern box-style building. Discussions have been held at local governmental level about demolishing this modern building and replacing it with a replica of the old theatre. In contrast, Ionian University reconstructed the Ionian Academy in all its former glory.

===The Achilleion===
{{Main|Achilleion (Corfu)}}
[[File:Achilles thniskon in Corfu.jpg|thumb|250px|Statue of ''Achille<U+00FA>s Thn<U+0113>sk<U+014D>n'' ([[Achilles]] Dying) in the gardens of the Achilleion.]]

Empress (German: ''[[Kaiserin]]'') of Austria [[Elisabeth of Bavaria]], also known as Sissi, was a woman entranced by beauty. She lost her only son, [[Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria]], when he committed [[murder]]-[[suicide]] in [[The Mayerling Incident]] of 1889. A year later, in 1890, she built a summer palace in the region of Gastouri (<U+0393><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03CD><U+03C1><U+03B9>) to the south of the city, with the powerful mythical hero [[Achilles]] as its central [[Theme (literature)|theme]].

The palace, with the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] Greek statues that surround it, is a monument to [[Platonism|platonic]] [[romanticism]] as well as [[escapism]]. It was named ''[[Achilleion (Corfu)|Ach<U+00ED>lleion]]'' (<U+0391><U+03C7><U+03AF><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03BD>) after the [[Homer]]ic hero Achilles. The structure is filled with paintings and statues of Achilles, both in the main hall and in the gardens, depicting the scenes of the [[Trojan War]].

The Imperial gardens on the hill look over the surrounding green hill crests and valleys and the [[Ionian sea]]. The centrepiece of the gardens is a marble statue on a high pedestal, of the mortally wounded Achilles ([[Greek language|Greek]]: <U+0391><U+03C7><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03CD><U+03C2> <U+0398><U+03BD><U+03AE><U+03C3><U+03BA><U+03C9><U+03BD>, ''Achille<U+00FA>s Thn<U+0113>sk<U+014D>n'', Achilles Dying) without [[hubris]] and wearing only a simple cloth and an ancient Greek [[hoplite]] helmet. This statue was carved by [[Germans|German]] [[sculptor]] [[Ernst Gustav Herter]]. The hero is presented devoid of rank or status, and seems notably human though heroic, as he is forever trying to pull [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]'s arrow from his heel.  His classically depicted face is full of pain. He gazes skyward, as if to seek help from [[Twelve Olympians|Olympus]]. According to [[Greek mythology]], his mother [[Thetis]] was a goddess.

In contrast, at the great staircase in the main hall is a giant painting of the triumphant Achilles full of [[hubris|pride]]. Dressed in full royal military regalia and erect on his racing chariot, he pulls the lifeless body of [[Hector of Troy]] in front of the stunned crowd watching helplessly from inside the walls of the Trojan citadel.

In 1898, Empress Sissi was assassinated at the age of 60 by an [[anarchist]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. After her death the palace was sold to the [[German Empire|German]] [[Kaiser]] [[William II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]. Later it was acquired by the Greek State. The Achilleion has been converted into a [[museum]].

===Kaiser's Bridge===
[[File:Kaiser's Bridge in Corfu.JPG|thumb|250px|Kaiser's Bridge in Corfu.]]

German [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] was also fond of taking holidays in Corfu. Having purchased the Achilleion in 1907 after Sissi's death, he appointed [[Carl Ludwig Sprenger]] as the botanical architect of the Palace, and also built a bridge to be named by the locals after him: "Kaiser's bridge" (Greek: <U+03B7> <U+03B3><U+03AD><U+03C6><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03B1> <U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C5> <U+039A><U+03AC><U+03B9><U+03B6><U+03B5><U+03C1> transliterated as: i yefyra tou Kaizer), to access the beach without traversing the road forming the island's main artery to the south. The bridge, arching over the road, spanned the distance between the lower gardens of Achilleion and the nearby beach; its remains, a monument to imperial vanity as well as impracticality, are an important landmark on the highway. The bridge's central section was, ironically, demolished by the [[Wehrmacht]] during the German occupation of World War II to allow for the free movement of its vehicles.<ref name="Corfu map">[http://www.corfu-map.net/news/latest/municipality-of-achilleon.html Corfu map]: The bridge was destroyed during a German attack in World War II. The remains can still be seen today.</ref>

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Dionysos Vacchos pediment at the Museum of Corfu.JPG|thumb|250px|A relief of [[Dionysus]] Bacchus at the Corfu Museum.]]

The earliest reference to Corfu is the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greek]] word ''ko-ro-ku-ra-i-jo (''"man from Kerkyra") written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script, ca. 1300 BC.<ref>[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&wid=493  Palaeolexicon, Word study tool of ancient languages]</ref> According to [[Strabo]] Corcyra (<U+039A><U+03CC><U+03C1><U+03BA><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03B1>) was the [[Homer]]ic island of [[Scheria]] (<U+03A3><U+03C7><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+03B1>),<ref name=Strabo>''Strab. vi. p. 407''</ref> and its earliest inhabitants were the [[Phaeacians]] (<U+03A6><U+03B1><U+03AF><U+03B1><U+03BA><U+03B5><U+03C2>). The island has indeed been identified by some scholars with Scheria, the island of the Phaeacians described in [[Homer]]'s Odyssey, though conclusive and irrefutable evidence for this theory or for [[Ithaca]]'s location have not been found. At a date no doubt previous to the foundation of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] it was peopled by settlers from [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], probably 730 BC, but it appears to have previously received a stream of emigrants from [[Eretria]]. The commercially advantageous location of Corcyra on the way between Greece and [[Magna Grecia]], and its fertile lowlands in the southern section of the island favoured its growth and, influenced perhaps by the presence of non-Corinthian settlers, its people, quite contrary to the usual practice of Corinthian colonies, maintained an independent and even hostile attitude towards the mother city. This opposition came to a head in the early part of the 7th century BC, when their fleets fought the first naval battle recorded in Greek history: 665 BC. according to [[Thucydides]]. These hostilities ended in the conquest of Corcyra by the Corinthian tyrant [[Periander]] (<U+03A0><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03B4><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2>) who induced his new subjects to join in the colonization of [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]] and [[Anactorium]]. The island soon regained its independence and henceforth devoted itself to a purely mercantile policy. During the [[Iran|Persia]]n invasion of 480 BC it manned the second largest Greek fleet (60 ships), but took no active part in the war. In 435 BC it was again involved in a quarrel with [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] over the control of [[Epidamnus]], and sought assistance from Athens (see [[Battle of Sybota]]). 
[[ File:Temple at Kardaki in Corfu.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The ruins of the Temple at Kardaki about 700 BC]]
This new alliance was one of the chief immediate causes of the [[Peloponnesian War]], in which Corcyra was of considerable use to the [[Athens|Athenians]] as a naval station, but did not render much assistance with its fleet. The island was nearly lost to Athens by two attempts of the oligarchic faction to effect a revolution; on each occasion the popular party ultimately won the day and took a most bloody revenge on its opponents (427 BC and 425 BC){{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. During the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] campaigns of Athens Corcyra served as a supply base; after a third abortive rising of the oligarchs in 410 BC it practically withdrew from the war. In 375 BC it again joined the Athenian alliance; two years later it was besieged by a [[Sparta]]n force, but in spite of the devastation of its flourishing countryside held out successfully until relieved. In the [[Hellenistic]] period Corcyra was exposed to attack from several sides.

In 303 BC after a vain siege by [[Cassander]], the island was occupied for a short time by the [[Lacedaemonian]] general [[Cleonymus of Sparta]], then regained its independence and later it was attacked and conquered by [[Agathocles]]. He offered Corfu as dowry to his daughter [[Lanassa (wife of Pyrrhus)|Lanassa]] on her marriage to [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], King of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]]. The island then became a member of the Epirotic alliance. It was then perhaps that the settlement of [[Cassiope(city)|Cassiope]] was founded to serve as a base for the King of Epirus' expeditions. The island remained in the Epirotic alliance until 255 BC when it became independent after the death of [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]], last King of Epirus. In 229, it was captured by the [[Illyrians]], but was speedily delivered by a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] fleet and remained a Roman naval station until at least 189. At this time, it was governed by a prefect (presumably nominated by the consuls), but in 148 it was attached to the province of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]]<ref>''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, Oxford: 1992.</ref> In 31 BC, it served [[Augustus Caesar|Octavian]] (Augustus) as a base against [[Mark Antony]]. From AD 336 onwards, it was ruled by the Eastern Roman Empire. After the definitive division of the Roman Empire in 395, Kerkyra remained with the Eastern Roman Empire, known in modern historiography as the Byzantine Empire.

===Medieval history===
[[File:Corfu citadel.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The northern side of the old citadel at night. The Great Cross can be clearly seen as described in the [[#Palaio Frourio|Palaio Frourio]] section of this article]]

Eclipsed by the foundation of [[Nicopolis]], Kerkyra for a long time passed out of notice. With the rise of the [[Normans|Norman]] kingdom in Sicily and the [[Italy|Italian]] naval powers, it again became a frequent object of attack. In 1081-1085 it was held by [[Robert Guiscard]], in 1147-1154 by [[Roger II of Sicily]]. During the break-up of the Later [[Byzantine Empire]] it was occupied by [[Genoa|Genoese]] privateers (1197<U+2013>1207) who in turn were expelled by the Venetians. In 1214-1259 it passed to the Greek [[despotate of Epirus|despots of Epirus]], and in 1267 became a possession of the Neapolitan house of [[Anjou]]. Under the latter's weak rule the island suffered considerably from the inroads of various adventurers; hence in 1386 it placed itself under the protection of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], which in 1401 acquired formal sovereignty over Corfu and kept it until the French Occupation in 1797.

====Venetian rule====
[[File:Pondikonissi Island 05-06-06.jpg|thumb|Pontikonisi island is home of the monastery of Pantokrator (<U+039C><U+03BF><U+03BD><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03AE><U+03C1><U+03B9> <U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C5> <U+03A0><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03BA><U+03C1><U+03AC><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2>). The white staircase of the monastery resembles from afar a (mouse) tail. The island got its name from this architectural (perceptual) quirk: Mouse island.]]

Kerkyra, the "Door of Venice" during the centuries when the whole Adriatic was the [[Gulf of Venice]],<ref>"The Gulf of Venice runs for 800 miles between Italy and Esclavonia, and at the end of it is the island of Corfu, which the Venetians call their door, although Venice is in fact 800 miles away." ([[Pedro Tafur]]  in 1436, ''[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/tafur.html#ch5 Andan<U+00E7>as e viajes]'').</ref> remained in Venetian hands from 1401 until 1797, though several times assailed by Turkish naval and land forces and subjected to four notable sieges in 1537, 1571, 1573 and 1716, in which the great natural strength of the city and its defenders asserted itself time after time. The effectiveness of the powerful Venetian fortifications of the island as well as the strength of some old Byzantine fortifications in [[Angelokastro (Corfu)|Angelokastro]], Kassiopi, Gardiki and others, was another strong factor that enabled Corfu to remain the last bastion of free, uninterrupted Greek Christian civilization in the southern Balkans after the fall of [[Constantinople]]. [[Will Durant]] claims that Corfu owed to the [[Republic of Venice]] the fact that it was the only part of Greece never conquered by the muslim Turks.<ref>Will Durant. ''The Renaissance''. pag 684. MJF Books. New York, 1981 ISBN 1-56731-016-8</ref>

A series of attempts by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turks to take the island began in 1431 when Turkish troops under Ali Bey landed on the island, tried to take the castle and raided the surrounding area, but were repulsed.<ref name="History of Corfu">{{cite web|url=http://www.corfuweb.gr/gb-history6.htm |title=History of Corfu |publisher=Corfuweb.gr |date= |accessdate=2009-06-29}}</ref>

The [[Siege of Corfu (1537)]] was the first great siege by the Ottomans. It began on the 29th August, 1537, with 25,000 soldiers from the Turkish fleet landing and pillaging the island and taking 20,000 hostages as slaves. Despite the destruction wrought on the countryside, the city castle held out in spite of repeated attempts over twelve days to take it, and the Turks left the island unsuccessfully because of poor logistics and an epidemic that decimated their ranks.<ref name="History of Corfu"/>

[[File:Angelokastro in Corfu.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Angelokastro (Corfu)|Angelokastro]] in Kerkyra. These were the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] fortifications that withstood the Turkish onslaught in 1571]]

Thirty-four years later, in August, 1571, Turkish forces returned for yet another attempt to conquer the island. Having seized Parga and Mourtos from the Greek mainland side they attacked the Paxi islands. Subsequently they landed on Corfu's southeast shore and established a large beachhead all the way from the southern tip of the island at Lefkimi to Ipsos in Corfu's eastern midsection. These areas were thoroughly pillaged as in past encounters. Nevertheless the city castle stood firm again, a testament to Corfiot-Venetian steadfastness as well as the Venetian castle-building [[engineering]] skills. It is also worth mentioning that another castle, [[Angelokastro (Corfu)|Angelokastro]] (Greek: <U+0391><U+03B3><U+03B3><U+03B5><U+03BB><U+03CC><U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03C1><U+03BF> meaning ''Angelo's Castle'' and named for its Byzantine owner Angelos Komnenos), situated on the northwest coast near Palaiokastritsa (Greek: <U+03A0><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+03C4><U+03C3><U+03B1> meaning ''Old Castle place'') and located on particularly steep and rocky terrain, a tourist attraction today, also held out.<ref name="History of Corfu"/>

These Turkish defeats in the east and the west of the island proved decisive and the Turks abandoned their siege and departed. Two years later Turkish forces repeated their attempt. Coming from [[Africa]] after a victorious campaign, they landed in Corfu and wreaked havoc on rural areas a further time. This force's troops were not particularly noted for their discipline, however, so following a counterattack by the Venetian-Corfiot forces they were forced to leave the city by way of the sea.<ref name="History of Corfu"/>

The second great siege of Corfu took place in 1716, during the last [[Turkish-Venetian War (1714-1718)|Turkish Venetian War]]. After the conquest of the Peloponnese in 1715, the Ottoman fleet appeared in [[Buthrotum|Butrinto]] opposite Corfu. On 8 July the Turkish fleet, carrying 33,000 men, sailed to Corfu from Butrinto and established a beachhead at Ipsos.<ref name="History of Corfu"/> The same day, the Venetian fleet encountered the Turkish fleet off the channel of Corfu and defeated it in the ensuing naval battle. On 19 July, after taking a few outlying forts, the Ottoman army reached the hills around the city of Corfu and laid siege to it. Despite repeated assaults and heavy fighting, the Turks were unable to breach the defences and were forced to raise the siege after 22 days. The 5,000 Venetians and foreign mercenaries, together with 3,000 Corfiotes, under the leadership of Count [[Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg|von der Schulenburg]] who commanded the defence of the island, were victorious once more.<ref name="History of Corfu from Corfu City Hall website"/><ref name="History of Corfu"/><ref name="History of Corfu from xenos website">[http://web.archive.org/web/20070814153129/http://www.corfuxenos.gr/History/venetian.htm History of Corfu from xenos website]</ref> The success is owed in no small part to the extensive fortifications, where Venetian castle engineering had proven itself once again against considerable odds. The repulse of the Ottomans was widely celebrated in Europe, Corfu being seen as a bastion of [[western culture|Western civilization]] against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] tide. Today, however, this role is often relatively unknown or ignored, but was celebrated in ''[[Juditha triumphans]]'' by the Venetian composer [[Antonio Vivaldi]].

====Venetian policies and heritage====
[[File:Corfuvenetianblazon.jpg|thumb|Venetian [[blazon]]s as frequently found on the New Fortress walls.]]
[[File:Ionian Academy in Daylight.JPG|thumb|left|The building of the Ionian Academy. Fully restored after the WWII Luftwaffe bombings.]]

Corfu Town looks very different from most Greek towns, because of Corfu's unique history. From 1386 to 1797, Corfu was ruled by Venetian nobility; much of the town reflects this era when the island belonged to the [[Republic of Venice]], with multi-storied buildings on narrow lanes.

Many Venetian-speaking families settled in Corfu during these centuries and until the second half of the 20th century, the ''[[Venetian language|Veneto da mar]]'' was spoken in Corfu: they were called [[Corfiot Italians]].  During this time, the local Greek language assimilated a large number of Italian and Venetian words, many of which are still common today.

The Venetian feudal families pursued a mild but somewhat enervating policy towards the natives, who began to adopt some segments of Venetian customs and culture. The Corfiotes were encouraged to enrich themselves by the cultivation of the olive, but were debarred from entering into commercial competition with Venice.

The island served as a refuge for Greek scholars, and in 1732 became the home of the first academy of modern Greece. A Corfu clergyman and scholar, [[Nikephoros Theotokis]] (1732<U+2013>1800) became renowned in Greece as an educator, and in [[Russia]] (where he moved later in his life) as an Orthodox archbishop.

Many Italian Jews took refuge in Corfu during the Venetian centuries and spoke their own language ([[Italkian]]), a mixture of Hebrew-Italian in a Venetian or Apulian dialect with some Greek words.

The Venetian influence was important in the development of opera on Corfu. During Venetian rule, the Corfiotes developed a fervent appreciation of Italian opera, which was the real source of the extraordinary (given the conditions in the mainland of Greece) musical development of the island during that era. It was in Venetian times that the town saw the erection of the first opera in Greece, but it was badly damaged during World War II by German artilery.

The internationally renowned Venetian-born British photographer [[Felice Beato]] is thought to have spent much of his childhood in Corfu.

Venetians promoted the [[Catholic church]] during their four centuries rule in Corfu. Even if today the majority of Corfiots are [[Greek Orthodox]] (following the official religion of Greece), a percentage of Catholics (5%) nevertheless owe their faith to these origins. These contemporary Catholics are mostly families who came from [[Malta]], but also from Italy during the [[Republic of Venice]], and  today the Catholic community takes in about 4000 people, (2/3 of Maltese descent) who live almost exclusively in the Venetian "Citadel" of [[Corfu City]], and harmoniously side-by-side with the Orthodox community. Like other native Greek Catholics, they celebrate [[Easter]] using the same calendar as the [[Greek Orthodox]] church.

The island's way of life absorbed Venetian influence in a variety of ways ; its local cuisine, for example, took in such elements and today's Corfiot cooking maintains some of these Venetian delicacies and recipes: "Pastitsada", deriving from the Venetian "Pastissada" (Italian: "Spezzatino") and is the most popular dish in the island of Corfu, "Sofrito", "Strapatsada", "Savoro", "Bianco" and "Mandolato".<ref name="destination-guides">[http://www.fantasticgreece.com/destination-guides/corfu-dining-guide.asp destination-guides] Food info</ref>

===19th century===
[[File:Russian-Gun-on-Corfu.jpg|thumb|250px|A Russian Gun from the Russian-Ottoman occupation of Corfu ([[Paleokastritsa]]) in the beginning of the 19th century]]
By the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], Corfu was ceded to the [[French Revolution|French]], who occupied it for two years as the ''[[French departments of Greece|d<U+00E9>partement]]'' [[Corcyre]], until they were expelled by a joint [[Russian Empire|Russia]]n-Ottoman squadron under [[Admiral Ushakov]]. For a short time it became the capital of a self-governing federation of the [[Septinsular Republic|Heptanesos]] ("Seven Islands"), under Ottoman suzerainty; in 1807 after the [[Treaty of Tilsit]] its faction-ridden government was again replaced by a French administration under governor [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Xavier Donzelot]], and in 1809 it was besieged in vain by a British fleet, which had taken all the other Ionian islands. When, by the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]] of 5 November 1815, the Ionian Islands became a protectorate of the [[United Kingdom]] as the [[United States of the Ionian Islands]], Corfu became the seat of the British [[Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands]]. The British commissioners, who were practically autocrats in spite of the retention of the native senate and assembly, introduced a strict method of government which brought about a decided improvement in the material prosperity of the island, but by its very strictness displeased the natives. On 29 March 1864, the United Kingdom, Greece, France and Russia signed the Treaty of London, pledging the transfer of sovereignty to Greece upon ratification. Thus, on 28 May, by proclamation of the Lord High Commissioner, the Ionian Islands were united with Greece.<ref name="History of Corfu"/>

===World War I===
[[File:Serbs Corfu1916-1918.jpg|thumb|Serbs in Corfu, 1916-1918]]

During the [[World War I|First World War]], the island served as a refuge for the [[Serbia]]n army that retreated there on [[Allied]] forces' ships from a homeland occupied by the [[Austria]]ns and [[Bulgarians]]. During their stay, a large portion of [[Serbia]]n soldiers died from exhaustion, food shortage, and different diseases. Most of their remains were buried at sea near the island of [[Vido]], a small island at the mouth of Corfu port, and a monument of thanks to the Greek nation has been erected at Vido by the grateful Serbs; consequently, the waters around Vido Island are known by the Serbian people as the [[Blue Graveyard]] (in Serbian, <U+041F><U+043B><U+0430><U+0432><U+0430> <U+0413><U+0440><U+043E><U+0431><U+043D><U+0438><U+0446><U+0430>, [[Plava Grobnica]]), after a poem written by [[Milutin Boji<U+0107>]] after World War I.<ref name="Serbs in Corfu">[http://web.archive.org/web/20070928084606/http://www.embassyscg.gr/Krf/KrfEng.htm Serbs in Corfu website]</ref>

===World War II and Resistance===
====Italian occupation====
[[File:Bay of Garitsa.PNG|thumb|250px|Bay of Garitsa]]

During the [[Greco-Italian War]], Corfu was occupied by the Italians in April 1941. They administered Corfu and the Ionian islands as a separate entity from Greece until September 1943, following [[Benito Mussolini]]'s orders of fulfilling  [[Italy|Italian]] [[Italia irredenta|Irredentism]] and making Corfu part of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]. During the Second World War the 10th [[infantry]] regiment of the [[Hellenic Army|Greek Army]], composed mainly of Corfiot soldiers,<ref name="Corfu cityhall history page">[http://www.corfu.gr/en/history.htm History of Corfu from Corfu City Hall website]</ref> was assigned the task of defending Corfu. The regiment took part in ''Operation Latzides,'' which was a heroic but ultimately unsuccessful attempt to stem the forces of the Italians.<ref name="Corfu cityhall history page"/> After Greece's surrender to the Axis, the island came under Italian control and occupation.<ref name="Corfu cityhall history page"/> On the first Sunday of November 1941, high school students from all over Corfu took part in [[student protest]]s against the occupying Italian army ; these student protests of the island were among the first acts of overt popular [[Greek Resistance|Resistance]] in occupied Greece and a rare phenomenon even by wartime [[Europe]]an standards.<ref name="Corfu cityhall history page"/> Subsequently, a considerable number of Corfiots escaped to [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] in mainland Greece and enlisted as [[Partisan (military)|partisan]]s in [[Ethnikos Laikos Apeleftherotikos Stratos|ELAS]] and [[Ethnikos Dimokratikos Ellinikos Syndesmos|EDES]], in order to join the resistance movement gathering in the mainland.<ref name="Corfu cityhall history page"/>

==== The German occupation and the Holocaust ====
Upon the fall of [[Italian fascism]] in 1943, the Nazis moved to take control of the island. On 14 September 1943, Corfu was bombarded by the [[Luftwaffe]]; these bombing raids destroyed churches, homes, whole city blocks, especially in the Jewish quarter Evraiki, and a number of  important buildings, such as the Ionian Parliament, the Municipal Theatre, the Municipal Library and others.<ref name="Corfu cityhall history page"/> The Italians capitulated, and the island came under German occupation. Corfu's mayor at the time, Kollas, was a known collaborator and various anti-semitic laws were passed by the Nazis that now formed the [[Military occupation|occupation]] government of the island.<ref name="USHMM">[http://www.ushmm.org/greece/eng/corfu.htm United States Holocaust Memorial Museum] on the Holocaust in Corfu.

====Liberation====

===Post-War and modern Corfu===
[[File:Saroko Square.JPG|thumb|250px|Saroko square.]]

After World War II and the [[Greek Civil War]], the island was rebuilt under the general programme of reconstruction of the Greek Government (<U+0391><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03B4><U+03CC><U+03BC><U+03B7><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03C2>) and many elements of its classical architecture remain. Its economy grew but a portion of its inhabitants left the island for other parts of the country; buildings erected during Italian occupation <U+2013> such as schools or government buildings <U+2013> were put back to civic use. In 1956 Maria Desylla Kapodistria, relative of first Governor of Greece [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], was elected [[mayor]] of [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]] and became the first female mayor in Greece.<ref name="web.archive.org">[http://web.archive.org/web/20041015102214/http://www.corfu.gr/en/proties/desila.htm Municipality of Corfu from the Internet archive] Quote:''In the elections of 1954 Stamatios Desillas was elected Mayor for a second term and remained in office until his death, Christmas Day 1955.

==Municipality==
The present municipality Corfu was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 15 former municipalities, that became municipal units:<ref name=Kallikratis/>
*[[Agios Georgios, Corfu|Agios Georgios]]
*[[Achilleio]]
*[[Corfu (city)]]
*[[Ereikoussa]]
*[[Esperies]]

*[[Meliteieis]]
*[[Othonoi]]
*[[Palaiokastritsa]]

==Education==
Aside from being a leading centre for the [[Fine Arts]], Corfu is also the home of the [[Ionian Academy]], an institution carrying through and strengthening the tradition of Greek education while the rest of Greece was still fighting Turkish occupation.

It is also home to the [[Ionian University]], established in 1984, in recognition, by the administration of [[Andreas Papandreou]], of Corfu's contribution to [[Education in Greece]], as the seat of the first Greek university in modern times,<ref>[http://www.ionio.gr/central/en/history History of the University]</ref> the [[Ionian Academy]]. The academy was founded in 1824, forty years before the cession of the [[Ionian islands]] to [[Greece]], and just three years after [[Greek Revolution|Greece's Revolution]] of 1821.

===Student activism===
The people of Corfu have in various historical contexts acted as a [[Western world|Western]] [[Barricade|bulwark]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In the  modern era, beginning with its massive student protests during World War II against fascist occupation, and continuing in the fight against the dictatorship of [[Georgios Papadopoulos]] (1967<U+2013>1974), students in Corfu have played a vanguard role in protesting in favour of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] and [[democracy]] in Greece, setting themselves against both internal and external oppression. For Corfiotes a recent example of such heroism is that of [[geology]] student [[Kostas Georgakis]], who set himself ablaze in [[Genoa]], [[Italy]] on 19 September 1970, in a protest against the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974]].

==Museums and libraries==

[[Saint Spyridon]] the Thaumaturgist (Miracle-worker, Greek: <U+039F> <U+0398><U+03B1><U+03C5><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03B3><U+03CC><U+03C2>), also referred to as <U+0391><U+03B3><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+03A3><U+03C0><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+03B4><U+03C9><U+03BD> <U+03BF> <U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03CD><U+03C7><U+03BF><U+03C2> (translated as Saint Spyridon the Keeper of the City), is the patron saint of the island. St. Spyridon is revered for the miracle of expelling the plague (<U+03C0><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03CE><U+03BB><U+03B7>) from the island, amongst many other miracles attributed to him. It is believed by the faithful that on its way from  the island the plague scratched one of the fortification stones of the old citadel to indicate its fury at being expelled ; St. Spyridon is also attributed  the role of  saving the island at the second great siege of Corfu of 1716.  Its legend ran that the sight   of  St. Spyridon  approaching turkish forces   bearing a flaming torch in one hand and a cross in the other, had  caused [[panic]].<ref name="History of Corfu"/><ref name="Catholic encyclopedia">{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04362a.htm |title=Catholic encyclopedia website |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-29}}</ref>  This [[miracle]] is one of the earliest successful examples of [[psychological operations]] in warfare (psyops). This victory over the Ottomans, therefore,  was attributed not only to the leadership of Count [[Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg|Schulenburg]] who commanded the stubborn defence of the island against Turkish forces, but also to the miraculous intervention of St. Spyridon.  Venice honoured von der Schulenburg and the Corfiots for successfully defending the island. Recognizing St. Spyridon's role in the defence of the island Venice legislated the establishment of the litany (<U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03AF><U+03B1>) of St Spyridon on the 11th of August as a commemoration of the miraculous event, inaugurating a tradition that continues to this day.<ref name="History of Corfu"/> In 1716 [[Antonio Vivaldi]], on commission by the republic of Venice, composed the [[oratorio]] [[Juditha triumphans]] to commemorate this great event. ''Juditha triumphans'' was performed in November 1716 in [[Venice]] by the orchestra and choir of the [[Ospedale della Piet<U+00E0>]] and is described as Vivaldi's first great oratorio.<ref name="Baroque music">[http://www.baroquemusic.org/bqxvivaldi.html Baroque Music] ''As far as his theatrical activities were concerned, the end of 1716 was a high point for Vivaldi. In November, he managed to have the Ospedale della Piet<U+00E0> perform his first great oratorio, Juditha Triumphans devicta Holofernis barbaric [sic]. This work was an allegorical description of the victory of the Venetians (the Christians) over the Turks (the barbarians) in August 1716.''</ref>

===Music and festivities===
====The Three Town Philharmonics====
[[File:Corfu Marching Band.JPG|thumb|250px|A marching band from [[Austria]], a frequent visitor, through the Corfu landmark of {{ill|it|Liston (square){{!}}Liston|Liston}}. In the background the western arch of [[#Palaia Anaktora and gardens|Palaia Anaktora]].]]

Corfiote musical tradition is significant. In the past, people  would  join in the singing of  ''cant<U+00E1>des'' ({{lang-el|<U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03AC><U+03B4><U+03B5><U+03C2>}}), impromptu choral songs in two, three or four voices, usually accompanied by a guitar. Nowadays, in the face of rigours of a modern life from which Corfiote society has not been spared, ''cant<U+00E1>des'' (from the Italian verb ''cantare'', ''to sing'') are only performed by semi-professional or amateur singers, often as attractions for visitors.

'Bands' (Philharmonic societies,  or ''<U+03A6><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03BC><U+03BF><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03AD><U+03C2>''), which also provide free instruction in music, are still popular and continue to attract young recruits.  There are nineteen such marching wind bands throughout the island.  <br>Corfu Town is home to the three most prestigious bands - in order of seniority:
* the [[Philharmonic Society of Corfu]] use dark blue uniforms with dark red accents, and blue and red helmet plumes. It is usually called the ''Old Philharmonic'' or simply the ''Pali<U+00E1>'' ("Old"). Founded September 12, [[1840]].
* the [[Nikolaos Mantzaros|Mantzaros]] Philharmonic Society use blue uniforms with blue and white helmet plumes. It is commonly called the ''N<U+00E9>a'' ("New"). Founded October 25, [[1890]].
* the [[John Capodistria|Capodistria]] Philharmonic Union use bright red and black uniforms and plumes. It is commonly called the ''C<U+00F3>nte Capod<U+00ED>stria'' or simply the ''C<U+00F3>nte'' ("[[Count]]"). It is the juniormost of the three (founded April 18, [[1980]]).
All three maintain two major bands each, the main marching bands that can field up to 200 musicians on grand occasions, and the 60-strong student ''bandinas'' meant for lighter fare and on-the-job training.

The bands give regular summer weekend promenade concerts at the Spianada Green [[gazebo|"''p<U+00E1>lko''"]], and have a prominent part in the yearly Holy Week ceremonies. A considerable but mostly friendly rivalry between them persists, and each rigorously adhere to their respective repertoires. Every time one of these bands passes in front of the building housing another, they stop and give a musical "salute" to their rival. While this is officially a sign of respect, it is actually a challenge meant to show off to the rivals and impress them with a display of superior musicianship.

====Easter====
[[File:Music Pavilion in Corfu.JPG|thumb|250px|The Music Pavilion in Spianada (Ano Plateia) with Palaio Frourio in the background. The philharmonics use it regularly for their free concerts]]
On [[Good Friday]], from the early afternoon onward, the bands of the three Philharmonic Societies, separated into squads, accompany the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaph processions]] of the town churches. Late in the afternoon, the squads come together to form one band in order to accompany the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaph procession]] of the cathedral, while the funeral marches that the bands play differ depending on the band ; the Old Philharmonic play [[Albinoni]]'s ''Adagio'', the Mantzaros play [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''Marcia Funebre'' from [[Don Carlo]], and the Capodistria play [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s ''Funeral March'' and [[Angelo Mariani (conductor)|Mariani]]'s ''Sventura''.<ref name="Easter">[http://web.archive.org/web/20071214202647/http://www.corfu.gr/en/culture/easter.htm Corfu city hall website on Easter festivities]</ref>

On Holy Saturday morning,  the three town bands again take part in the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaph processions]] of St. Spyridon Cathedral in procession with the Saint's relics.<ref name="Easter"/> At this point the bands play different funeral marches, with the Mantzaros playing [[Miccheli]]'s ''Calde Lacrime'', the Palia playing ''Marcia Funebre'' from [[Franco Faccio|Faccio]]'s ''[[Amleto]]'', and the Capodistria playing  the ''Funeral March'' from [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica]]''.  This custom dates from the 19th century, when colonial administrators banned the participation of the British garrison band in the traditional Holy Friday funeral cortege.  The defiant Corfiotes held the litany the following morning, and paraded the relics of St. Spyridon too, so that the administrators would not dare intervene.

The litany is followed by the celebration of the "Early Resurrection";  balconies in the old town are decked in bright red cloth, and Corfiotes throw down large clay pots (the ''b<U+00F3>tides'', <U+03BC><U+03C0><U+03CC><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03B4><U+03B5><U+03C2>) full of water to smash on the street pavement, especially in wider areas of {{ill|it|Liston (square){{!}}Liston|Liston}} and in an organised fashion.<ref name="Easter"/> This is enacted in anticipation of the Resurrection of Jesus, which is to be celebrated that same night,<ref name="Easter"/> and to commemorate [[King David]]'s phrase: "''Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel''" ([[Psalm 2]]:9).

Once the ''b<U+00F3>tides'' commotion is over, the three bands parade the clay-strewn streets playing the famous "''Graiko<U+00ED>''" festive march.<ref name="Band rivalry">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE1yagErUbQ As the Old Philharmonic concludes its marching in front of their building with a hearty rendition of the ''Graiko<U+00ED>'' March, the New Philharmonic appears and "salutes" their rivals with yet another rendition of the same march]</ref>  This legendary march, the anthem of the island, was composed during Venetian rule, and its lyrics urged: "''Greeks, never fear, we are all enslaved: you to the Turks, we to the Venetians, but one day we shall all be free''".  The Venetians were replaced by the French and the French by the British, and both the lyrics and the performance of the march were officially banned.  The bands, however, defiantly played it on the Eve of Easter, as a token of the resurrection of the nation, and the tradition is honored to this day.

====Musical history====
While much of present-day Greece was under Ottoman rule, the Ionian Islands enjoyed a Golden Age in music and opera. Corfu was the capital city of a prized Venetian colony and it benefited from a unique musical and theatrical heritage. Then in the 19th century, as a [[Protectorate|British Protectorate]], Corfu developed a musical heritage of its own and which constitutes the nucleus of modern Greek musical history. Until the early 18th century, musical life took place in town and village squares, with performances of straight or musical comedies <U+2013> known as Momaries or Bobaries. From [[1720]], Corfu became the possessor of the first theatre in post-[[1452]] Greece. It was the Teatro San Giacomo (now the Town Hall) named after the nearby Roman Catholic cathedral (completed in [[1691]]).<ref>Corfu the Garden Isle, editor Frank Giles, John Murray 1994, ISBN 071955375X</ref>

====Teatro di San Giacomo====
[[File:New Municipal Theatre of Corfu.JPG|thumb|The new municipal theatre.]]
{{Main|Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corf<U+00F9>}}

In [[Republic of Venice|Venetian rule]], the Corfiotes developed a fervent appreciation of Italian [[opera]], which was the real source of the extraordinary (given conditions in the mainland of [[Greece]]) musical development of the island during this era.<ref name="BirthofGreekopera">[http://www.donizettisociety.com/Articles/ArticleMantzaros/BirthofGreekopera.pdf Birth of Greek opera Paper] Kostas Kardamis "San Giacomo and Greek ottocento"XI Convegno Annuale di Societ<U+00E0> Italiana di Musicologia [[Lecce]], 22<U+2013>24 October 2004</ref> The opera house of Corfu during 18th and 19th century was that of the  [[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corf<U+00F9>|Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo]], named after the neighbouring catholic cathedral, but  the theatre was later converted into the Town Hall.<ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/>  It was both the first [[theatre]] and first [[opera house]] of Greece in [[modern history|modern times]] and the place where the first Greek opera, [[Spyridon Xyndas]]' "The Parliamentary Candidate" based on an exclusively Greek [[libretto]] was performed.<ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/> A long series of  local composers, such as [[Nikolaos Mantzaros]], [[Spyridon Xyndas]], [[Antonio Liberali]], [[Domenico Padovani]], the [[Zante|Zakynthian]] [[Pavlos Carrer]], the [[Lambelet]] family, [[Spyridon Samaras]],  and others, all developed careers intertwined  with the theatre.<ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/> San Giacomo's place was taken by the Municipal Theatre in 1902, which maintained  the operatic tradition vividly  until its destruction during [[World War II]] as a result of a 1943 [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|German air raid]].<ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/>

The first opera to be performed in the San Giacomo was in 1733 ("[[Hiero I|Gerone]], [[tyrant|tiranno]] di [[Syracuse, Sicily|Siracusa]]"),<ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/> and for almost two hundred years, between 1771 and 1943, nearly every major opera from the [[Italian culture|Italian]] tradition, as well as many others from Greek and French composers, were performed at the stage of the San Giacomo; this impressive tradition, invoking an exceptional musical heritage, continues to be reflected in Corfiote operatic mythology, a fixture in famous opera singers' itineraries.<ref name="History of the theatre">[http://web.archive.org/web/20080204022549/http://www.corfu.gr/en/profil/theatro.htm History of the theatre] from Corfu cityhall</ref>

====Ionian University and musical tradition====
Since the early 1990s a music department has been established at the [[Ionian University]].  Aside from its  academic activities,  concerts in Corfu and abroad,  and  musicological research in the field of  Neo-Hellenic Music, the Department organizes an international music academy every summer , which gathers both international students and   professors specialising  in [[Brass instrument|brass]], [[strings (music)|strings]], [[singing]], [[jazz]] and [[musicology]].

====Ta Karnavalia====
Another venerable Corfu tradition is known as the  [[Carnival]] or ''Ta Karnavalia.'' Venetian in origin,  festivities include a parade featuring the main attraction of ''Karnavalos,'' a rather [[grotesque]] figure with a large head and  smiling face ,  leading a diverse procession of  colourful [[Float (parade)|float]]s.<ref name="Karnavalia">[http://web.archive.org/web/20071214202625/http://www.corfu.gr/en/culture/carnav.htm Corfu city hall website on Karnavalia]</ref> Corfiots, young and old, dress up in colourful costumes and follow the parade,  spilling out  into the area's  narrow streets (kantounia)  and spreading the festivities   across the city,<ref name="Karnavalia"/>  dancing and socialising.

===Corfu in literature===
*British naturalist [[Gerald Durrell]] wrote three well-loved books about his 1935<U+2013>1940 childhood on Corfu: ''[[My Family and Other Animals]]''; ''[[Birds, Beasts and Relatives]]''; and ''[[The Garden of the Gods]]''. His brother, literary author [[Lawrence Durrell]], also wrote a volume about Corfu: ''Prospero's Cell: A Guide to the Landscape and Manners of the Island of Corcyra (Corfu)''.

===Corfu in film===
*A number of cinema productions have been filmed in Corfu, including the 1981 James Bond movie, ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]''. The most memorable  scene of the film to be bound with the island  is  of the underwater ancient Greek temple, with a huge [[turtle]] swimming in front of the camera;  a casino scene was also filmed at the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]].<ref name="Bond Casino">{{cite web|url=http://www.007.info/FactfileFYEO.asp |title=007 Fact website |publisher=007.info |date=1981-06-24 |accessdate=2009-06-29}}</ref> Other scenes filmed here  include those tracing 'Melina' and James' walk through the town's  streets, and Melina being greeted by Bond at Pontikonisi island.

*Corfu is also the setting of a  1987 [[BBC]] TV series version, and a 2005 BBC movie version, of ''[[My Family and Other Animals]]'', [[Gerald Durrell]]'s book about his childhood in Corfu in the late 1930s.

===Corfu in popular culture===
Corfu is one of the locations in the legend of Simon and Milo, where Simon falls in love temporarily.  It is the setting of the 1998 song ''[[Mediterranean Lady]]'' by ''[[Prozzak]]''. The island is alluded to several times in David Foster Wallace's ''The Broom of the System''. Drake mentions Corfu in a song.

===Tourism===

Corfiotes have a long history of hospitality to foreign residents and visitors, typified in the twentieth century by [[Gerald Durrell]]'s childhood reminiscence ''My Family and Other Animals''.  The North East coast has largely been developed by a few British holiday companies, with large expensive holiday villas.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/greathomesanddestinations/11iht-recorfu.html | work=The New York Times | title=Overseas Buyers Fall for Corfu's Historic Charm | first=Nick | last=Foster | date=2009-09-11 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref> [[Package holiday]] resorts exist on the north and east coasts.

At the other end of the island, the southern resort of [[Kavos]] also provides tourist facilities.

==Transportation==
[[File:Mountain Road in Corfu.JPG|thumb|left|A mountain road in northwestern Corfu.]]

The island is linked by two motorways, GR-24 in the northwest and GR-25 in the south.

Corfu has ferry services both by traditional ferries to Gaios in the island of [[Paxoi]] and as far as [[Patras]] and both traditional ferries and advanced retractable [[airfoil]], [[hydrodynamic]]-flow, high-speed ferries called '''Flying Dolphins''' to [[Igoumenitsa]] and [[Sarand<U+00EB>]] in neighbouring [[Albania]]. The small port of '''Lefkimmi''' is also to be found at the southernmost tip of the island on '''Cape Kavos''', offering a [[ferry boat|ferry]] service to the mainland.

The [[Ioannis Kapodistrias International Airport]], named after [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], a distinguished Corfiot and European diplomat, and the first governor of the independent Greek state, is located around three kilometres south of Kerkyra, just half a kilometre north of Pontikonisi. The approach and landing, in a northeasterly direction, afford passengers spectacular aerial views of  '''Pontikonisi''' and '''Vlaheraina Monastery''', also taking in the hills of '''Kanoni''', as the runway employed for landing lies a few hundred metres from these spectacular local landmarks. The airport  offers domestic flights from [[Olympic Airlines]] (OA 600, 602 and 606), and [[Aegean Airlines]] (A3 402, 404 and 406). Seaplanes, Air Sea Lines, a Greek seaplane operator, offers scheduled flights from Corfu to Paxoi, Lefkada, Ithaki, kefalonia, [[Ioannina]], Patras and [[Brindisi]] in [[Italy]].

The buses to the main places on the island run about six times a day between the city and Glyfada, Sidari, Pleokastritsa, Roda and Acharavi, Lefkimmi, Lefkimmi and Piri. Other coaches drive up to twice a day to Athens and Thessaloniki. City buses run through the city to the Achilleon, Gouvia, Afra, Pelekas and some other places of interest. There are no public buses to the airport.

==Economy==
[[File:Ships in Corfu.PNG|thumb|Shipping traffic near Corfu harbour. Vido island is in the foreground with the Albanian coast line in the background.]]

Corfu is mostly planted with olive groves and vineyards and has been producing olive oil and wine since antiquity.  The main wine grape varietals found in Corfu are the indigenous white ''Kakotr<U+00FD>g<U+0113>s'' and red ''Petrok<U+00F3>ritho'', the [[Cefalonia]]n white ''Rob<U+00F3>la'', the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] ''Mosch<U+00E1>to'' (white [[Muscat (grape and wine)|muscat]]), the [[Achaea]]n ''Mavrod<U+00E1>phn<U+0113>'' and others.<ref name="Corfiote wine">{{cite web|url=http://www.greekwinemakers.com/czone/regions/kerk.shtml |title=At the time of his writing, Lambert-Gocs found 1800 hectares of vines dominated mainly by white Kakotrygis and red Petrokoritho (both cultivars having both red and white versions).

[[File:KoumQuatLiqueur.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Kumquat|Koum Quat]] [[Liqueur]]s, produced in Corfu]]

Modern times have seen the introduction of specialist cultivation supported by the mild climate, like the [[kumquat]] and [[bergamot orange]]s, which are extensively used in making [[spoon sweets]] and [[liqueur]]s.  Corfu also produces local animal products, such as Corfiote ''gravi<U+00E9>ra'' (a variant of [[Gruy<U+00E8>re (cheese)|gruyere]]) and "''Corfu''" cheese (a variant of [[Grana (cheese)|Grana]]); "Corfu [[butter]]" (''Bo<U+00FA>tyro Kerk<U+00FD>ras''), an intensely flavored cooking and baking butter made of [[ewe's milk]]; and the ''no<U+00FA>mboulo'' [[salami]] made of pork and lard and flavored with orange peel, oregano, thyme and other aromatic herbs, which are also burned for smoking.

Local culinary specialties include ''[[sofrito]]'' (a [[veal]] rump roast of [[Venice|Venetian]] origin), ''pastits<U+00E1>da'' ([[bucatini]] pasta served with diced veal cooked in a [[tomato]] sauce), ''bourd<U+00E9>tto'' ([[cod]] cooked in a [[Capsicum|pepper]]y sauce), ''m<U+00E1>ndoles'' (caramelized [[almonds]]), ''past<U+00E9>li'' ([[honey]] bars made with [[sesame]], [[almond]]s or [[pistacchio]]s), ''mandol<U+00E1>to'' (a "past<U+00E9>li" made of crushed almonds, sugar, honey and [[vanilla]]), and ''tzitzib<U+00ED>ra'', the local [[ginger beer]], a remnant of the British era.

The island has again become an important [[port of call]] and has a considerable trade in olive oil. In earlier times there was a great export of [[Greek citron|citron]], which was cultivated here.
