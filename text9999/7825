The '''Drake Passage''' or '''Mar de Hoces'''&mdash;Sea of [[Francisco de Hoces|Hoces]]&mdash;is the body of water between the southern tip of [[South America]] at [[Cape Horn]], [[Chile]] and the [[South Shetland Islands]] of [[Antarctica]].  It connects the southwestern part of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] ([[Scotia Sea]]) with the southeastern part of the [[Pacific Ocean]] and extends into the [[Southern Ocean]]. 
The passage receives its English language name from the 16th century [[England|English]] [[privateer]]  [[Sir Francis Drake]].  Drake's [[Golden Hind|only remaining ship]], after having passed through the [[Strait of Magellan]], was blown far South in September 1578.  This incident implied an open connection between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

Half a century earlier, after a gale had pushed them South from the entrance of the Strait of Magellan, the crew of the [[Spain|Spanish]] navigator [[Francisco de Hoces]] thought they saw a land's end and possibly inferred this passage in 1525.<ref name=Oyarzun>Oyarzun, Javier, ''Expediciones espa<U+00F1>olas al Estrecho de Magallanes y Tierra de Fuego'', 1976, Madrid: Ediciones Cultura Hisp<U+00E1>nica ISBN 84-7232-130-4</ref> For this reason, some Spanish and [[Latin America]]n [[historian]]s and sources call it '''Mar de Hoces''' after Francisco de Hoces. 

The first recorded voyage through the passage was that of the ''Eendracht'', captained by the Dutch navigator [[Willem Schouten]] in 1616, naming Cape Horn in the process.

The {{convert|800|km|mi|adj=on}} wide passage between Cape Horn and [[Livingston Island (South Shetland Islands)|Livingston Island]] is the shortest crossing from Antarctica to the rest of the world's land. The boundary between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans is sometimes taken to be a line drawn from Cape Horn to [[Snow Island]] ({{convert|130|km|mi}} north of mainland Antarctica). Alternatively the meridian that passes through Cape Horn may be taken as the boundary. Both boundaries lie entirely within the Drake Passage.

The other two passages around Cape Horn, Magellan Strait and [[Beagle Channel]], are very narrow, leaving little room for a ship, particularly a [[sailing ship]], to maneuver. They can also become [[ice]]bound, and sometimes the [[wind]] blows so strongly no [[sailing]] vessel can make headway against it. Hence most sailing ships preferred the  Drake Passage, which is open water for hundreds of miles, despite very rough conditions. The very small [[Diego Ram<U+00ED>rez Islands]] lie about {{convert|100|km|mi}} south-southwest of Cape Horn. 

There is no significant land anywhere around the world at the [[latitude]]s of the Drake Passage, which is important to the unimpeded flow of the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] which carries a huge volume of water (about 600 times the flow of the [[Amazon River]]) through the Passage and around Antarctica.

Ships in the passage are often good platforms for the sighting of [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s and plentiful seabirds including [[giant petrel]]s, other [[petrel]]s, [[albatross]]es and [[penguin]]s.

The passage is known to have been closed until around 41 [[million years ago]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4928010.stm |title=Fossil gives clue to big chill |date=21 April 2006 |author=Helen Briggs |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2007-11-01}}</ref> according to a chemical study of [[Shark tooth|fish teeth]] found in [[ocean]]ic [[sedimentary rock]]. Before the passage opened, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans were separated entirely with Antarctica being much warmer and having no [[ice cap]]. The joining of the two great oceans started the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] and cooled the [[continent]] significantly.
