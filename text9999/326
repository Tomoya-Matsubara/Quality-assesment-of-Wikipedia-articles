'''Herbert "Herb" Alpert''' (born [[March 31]], [[1935]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[musician]] most associated with the '''Tijuana Brass''', a now-defunct [[brass band]] of which he was leader. He is also famous for being a recording industry executive &mdash; he is the "A" of [[A&M Records]] (a [[record label|recording label]] he and then [[Partnership|partner]] [[Jerry Moss]] founded and eventually sold). Alpert's musical accomplishments include five number one hits, twenty-eight albums on the [[Billboard charts]], eight [[Grammy Awards]], fourteen [[Music recording sales certification|Platinum albums]] and fifteen [[Music recording sales certification|Gold albums]].<ref>{{cite web|date=1996|url=http://www.herbalpert.com/biocomponents/bio.html|title=Herb Alpert - Biography|publisher=Almo Sounds, Inc.}}</ref> As of 1996, Alpert had sold 72 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|date=1996|url=http://www.herbalpert.com/biocomponents/chrono.html|title=Herb Alpert - Chronology|publisher=Almo Sounds, Inc.}}</ref>.<ref>{{cite web|date=2002|url=http://www.onamrecords.com/History_1.html|title=A&M Records History 1962-1969- |publisher=On A&M Records.com}}</ref>


== Early life and career ==
Alpert began [[trumpet]] lessons at about the age of eight and played at dances as a teenager. After graduating from [[Fairfax High School (West Hollywood, California)|Fairfax High School]] in 1952, he joined the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and frequently performed at military ceremonies. After his service in the Army, Alpert tried his hand at [[acting]], but eventually settled on pursuing a career in [[music]]. While attending the [[University of Southern California]] in the [[1950s]], he was a member of the [[Spirit of Troy|USC Trojan Marching Band]] for two years.  He graduated with a BM in [[1954]].

In 1957, Alpert teamed up with [[Lou Adler]], another burgeoning musician, as a songwriter for Keen Records. A number of songs written or co-written by Alpert during the following two years became top twenty hits, including "Baby Talk" by [[Jan and Dean]], "Wonderful World" by [[Sam Cooke]], and "Alley-Oop" by Dante and The Evergreens. <ref>{{cite web|date=1996|url=http://www.herbalpert.com/biocomponents/chrono.html|title=Herb Alpert - Chronology|publisher=Almo Sounds, Inc.}}</ref> In 1960, Alpert began his recording career as a vocalist at [[RCA Records]] under the name of Dore Alpert, where he recorded an early vocal, "Tell it to the Birds".

== The Tijuana Brass years ==
Alpert set up a small [[recording studio]] in his garage and was [[overdubbing]] a tune called "Twinkle Star" when, during a visit to [[Tijuana]], [[Mexico]], he happened to hear a [[mariachi band]] while attending a [[Bullfighting|bullfight]]. Following the experience, Alpert recalled that he was "inspired to find a way to musically express what [he] felt while watching the wild responses of the crowd, and hearing the brass musicians introducing each new event with rousing fanfare."<ref>{{cite web|date=1997-2006|url=http://www.tijuanabrass.com/|title=Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass Discography at A&M Corner|publisher=A&M Corner}}</ref> Alpert adapted the [[trumpet]] style to the tune, [[Audio mixing|mixed]] in crowd cheers and other noises to create ambiance, and renamed the song, "The Lonely Bull." He paid out of his own pocket to press the record as a single, and it spread through [[radio DJ]]s until it caught on and became a Top Ten hit in 1963. He followed up quickly with an [[album]] of "The Lonely Bull" and other titles.

Alpert released his debut [[album]], ''The Lonely Bull by Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass''. The Tijuana Brass were [[studio musician]]s. The title cut reached #6 on the [[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]] Pop Singles Chart. This was also [[A&M Records|A&M]]'s first [[album]] (the original number was 101), but was recorded at Conway Records.

By the end of 1964, due to a growing demand for live appearances by the Tijuana Brass, Alpert [[audition]]ed and hired a team of crack [[studio musicians|session men]]. No one in Alpert's band was actually [[Hispanic]]. Alpert used to tell his audiences that his group consisted of "Three [[pastrami]]s, two [[bagel]]s, and an [[American cheese]]": [[John Pisano]] ([[electric guitar]]); [[Lou Pagani]] ([[piano]]); [[Nick Ceroli]] ([[drums]]); [[Pat Senatore]] ([[bass guitar]]); [[Tonni Kalash]] ([[trumpet]]); [[Herb Alpert]] ([[trumpet]] and [[vocal]]); [[Bob Edmondson]] ([[trombone]]). The band debuted in 1965 and quickly became one of the highest-paid acts then performing, having put together a complete [[revue]] that included [[choreographed]] moves and [[comic]] routines written by [[Bill Dana (comedian)|Bill ("Jose Jimenez") Dana]]. 

The Tijuana Brass's success helped spawn other [[Latin]] acts, notably [[Julius Wechter]] (long-time friend of Alpert's and the [[marimba]] player for the Brass) and the Baja Marimba Band, and the profits allowed [[A&M Records|A&M]] to begin building a repertoire of artists like [[Chris Montez]] and [[The Sandpipers]].

In addition, the Tijuana Brass's style was adopted by American bands as well, most notably [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] and [[Earth, Wind & Fire]].  Both bands would score major hits in the 1970s and early 1980s.

[[Image:HA_WhippedCream.jpg|left|thumb|225px|''Whipped Cream and Other Delights'']]
An [[album]] or two would be released each year throughout the 1960s. Alpert's style achieved enormous popularity with the national exposure [[Clark's Teaberry|The Clark Gum Company]] gave to one of his tunes in 1964, titled "The Mexican Shuffle" (which was retitled "[[Clark's Teaberry|The Teaberry Shuffle]]" for the [[television]] [[advertisement|ads]]).  In 1965, Alpert released two [[album]]s, ''Whipped Cream (and Other Delights)'' and ''Going Places''. ''Whipped Cream'' sold over 6 million copies in the [[United States]] and the album cover is considered a classic. It featured model [[Dolores Erickson]] wearing [[Chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]] and [[shaving cream]]. In [[concert]]s, when about to play the song, Alpert would tell the audience, "Sorry, we can't play the cover for you." The art was [[parodied]] by several groups including onetime [[A&M Records|A&M]] band [[Soul Asylum]]. The singles included the title cut, "[[Lollipops and Roses (song)|Lollipops and Roses]]", and "A Taste of Honey", the latter won a [[Grammy Award]] for Record of the Year. ''Going Places'' produced four more singles "Tijuana Taxi", "Spanish Flea", "Third Man Theme", and "Zorba the Greek".

Many of the tracks from ''Whipped Cream'' and ''Going Places'' received a great deal of [[airplay (song)|airplay]], and still do at times; for example, they are frequently used as [[incidental music]] in ''[[The Dating Game]]'' on the [[Game Show Network]], notably the tracks ''Whipped Cream'', ''Spanish Flea'' and ''Lollipops and Roses''. Despite the popularity of his singles, Alpert's [[album]]s outsold and outperformed them on the [[Record chart|charts]].

Alpert and the Tijuana Brass won six [[Grammy awards]]. Fifteen of their [[album]]s won [[gold album|gold]] discs, and fourteen won [[gold album|platinum]] discs. In 1966, his music outsold ''[[The Beatles]]'' by two to one - over 13 million Alpert recordings were sold.  That same year, the ''[[Guinness Book of Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'' recognized that Alpert set a new record by placing five [[album]]s simultaneously on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' Pop Album [[Record chart|Chart]], an accomplishment that has never been repeated. In April of that year, four of those albums were in the Top 10 simultaneously.

The dearth of in-depth, unauthorized biographical/historical material on Alpert is somewhat curious given that so much has been written about the only three recording artists who outsold him in the 1960s - [[Elvis Presley]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and the Beatles. This is perhaps explained by the apparent lack of any outrageous, dramatic, or tragic elements in his life. There were, however, hundreds of articles written about Alpert by mainstream general and music newspapers and magazines.

Alpert's only number one single during this period (and the first #1 hit for his A&M label) was a solo effort[http://www.tijuanabrass.com/alpert/alpert1.php3]: "[[This Guy's in Love with You]]" (written by [[Burt Bacharach]] and [[Hal David]]), featuring a rare [[vocal]]. Alpert sang this to his first wife in a 1968 [[CBS Television]] special titled ''Beat of the Brass''. The sequence was taped on the [[beach]] in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]. The song was not intended to be released, but after it was used in the [[television]] special, thousands of [[telephone]] calls to [[CBS Television|CBS]] asking about it, convinced [[record label|label]] owner Alpert to release it as a single, two days after the show aired.[http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1811]. Alpert's [[vocal]] skills were limited, but this song also had a limited [[vocal range|range]], and it worked for him. The single debuted in April 1968, topped the national chart for four weeks and ranked high among the year's biggest hits. Initially dismissed by the critical cognoscenti and "hip" music-lovers as strictly a housewife's favourite, Alpert's unusually expressive recording of "This Guy's in Love with You" is now regarded as one of the monumental ballads in pop. In 1996 at London's [[Royal Festival Hall]], [[Noel Gallagher]] (of British rock band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]) performed the song with Burt Bacharach.

== Life after the Brass ==
Alpert disbanded the Tijuana Brass in 1969, but released another album by the group in 1971. In 1973, with some of the original Tijuana Brass members and some new members, he formed a group called the T.J.B. This new version of the Brass released two albums in 1974 and 1975 and toured. Alpert reconvened a third version of the Brass in 1984 after being invited to perform for the [[Olympic Games]] [[athlete]]s at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Summer Games]]. The invitation led to the Bullish [[album]] and tour. 

In the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, Alpert enjoyed a successful [[Solo album|solo]] [[career]]. He had his biggest [[instrumental]] hit, "[[Rise (Herb Alpert song)|Rise]]" (from the album of the same name), which went number one in October of 1979 and won a [[Grammy Award]], and was later [[sampled]] in the 1997 [[Hip hop music|rap]] song "[[Hypnotize (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Hypnotize]]" by the late [[rapper]] [[Notorious B.I.G]]. It also made Alpert the only solo [[recording artist|artist]] ever to hit #1 on the ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Record chart|chart]]s with both [[vocal]] and [[instrumental]] pieces.  In [[1987]], he branched out successfully to the [[R&B]] world with hit album [[Keep Your Eye On Me]], teaming up with producers [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] on both the hit title song and "Diamonds" featuring vocals by Janet Jackson. The song "Route 101" peaked at number 37 in [[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]] in [[August]] of [[1982]].

From 1962 through 1992 Alpert [[Recording contract|signed]] [[Recording artist|artists]] to [[A&M Records]] and [[Record producer|produced records]]. Among the notable [[Recording artist|artist]]s he worked with personally are Chris Montez, [[The Carpenters]], [[Sergio Mendes|Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66]], [[Bill Medley]], [[Lani Hall]] (Alpert's second and current wife), and [[Janet Jackson]] (featured [[vocalist]] on his 1987 hit [[Single (music)|single]] "Diamonds").  These working relationships have allowed Alpert to become one of only a handful of artists to place singles in the Top 10 in at least three different decades ('60s, '70s, and '80s).

Alpert and A&M Records [[Partnership|partner]] [[Jerry Moss]] received a [[Grammy Trustees Award]] in 1997 for their lifetime achievements in the [[recording industry]] as [[corporate officer|executive]]s.

For his contribution to the recording industry, Herb Alpert has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6929 [[Hollywood Blvd]]. [[Jerry Moss|Moss]] also has a star on the Walk of Fame.  Alpert and Moss were also inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on [[March 13]], [[2006]] as non-performer lifetime achievers for their work at A&M.

== Today ==
Alpert continues to play his [[trumpet]] and devotes time to his second [[career]] as an [[abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] [[painter]] and [[sculptor]] with shows around the [[United States]], as a [[Broadway theatre]] [[Theatre producer|producer]]. His production of [[Tony Kushner]]'s ''[[Angels in America]]'' won a [[Tony Award|Tony award]]. 

In the 1980s he created [[The Herb Alpert Foundation]] and [[The Alpert Awards in the Arts]][http://www.alpertawards.org/] with [[The California Institute of the Arts|The California Institute of the Arts (CalArts)]]. The [[Foundation]] supports youth and [[arts education]] as well as [[environmental issues]] and helps fund the PBS series "Bill Moyers on Faith and Reason."

Although he has not released an [[album]] of new material since 1999's "Colours", he is actively overseeing the reissue of his [[music]] [[library catalog|library]]. In 2000, Alpert bought back the rights to his music from [[Universal Music]] (current owners of [[A&M Records]]), and began [[remix]]ing and [[remaster]]ing his [[album]]s for a [[Compact Disc|CD]] reissue. In 2005, [[Shout! Factory]] began distributing [[digital]]ly [[remaster]]ed versions of Alpert's [[A&M|A&M Records]] output, including a new [[album]] consisting of unreleased material from Alpert's Tijuana Brass.

He continues to be a guest artist for friends like [[Gato Barbieri]], [[Rita Coolidge]], [[Jim Brickman]], Brian Culbertson and [[David Lanz]].
