'''Devonport''' is a harbourside suburb of [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. The population of Devonport and the adjoining suburb of [[Cheltenham, New Zealand|Cheltenham]] was 5,337 in the [[New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings|2006 Census]], an increase of 126 from 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/census/2006-census-data/final-counts/auckland-region.htm|title=Final counts <U+2013> census night and census usually resident populations, and occupied dwellings - North Shore City|publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]]}} The statistical area used by the Census is called Mt Victoria.</ref>
With the additional suburbs of [[Stanley Bay, New Zealand|Stanley Bay]], [[Vauxhall, Auckland|Vauxhall]] and [[Narrow Neck, New Zealand|Narrow Neck]], the 2006 population was 11,142.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/Places/Auckland/AucklandPlaces/5/en|title=The North Shore|encyclopedia=[[Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate=2008-06-16}}</ref> It is located on the [[North Shore City|North Shore]], at the southern end of a peninsula that runs southeast from near [[Lake Pupuke]] in [[Takapuna]], forming the northern side of the [[Waitemata Harbour]]. East of Devonport lies [[North Head, New Zealand|North Head]], the northern promontory guarding the mouth of the harbour.

The suburb hosts the [[Devonport Naval Base]] of the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]], the main facility for the country's naval vessels, but is best known for its harbourside dining and drinking establishments and its heritage charm. 

== Character ==

The Devonport shops contain a fair array of antiques, gift & book shops as well a number of good cafes and restaurants making it a popular destination for tourists and Aucklanders. People often travel over from Auckland on the ferry for dinner, the starry sky and glittering lights of Auckland on the return trip being very beautiful. For its shoreside feel, Devonport has also been compared in feel to [[Sausalito, California]].<ref name="DOING">''[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03EFDF113AF936A35753C1A961958260&scp=34&sq=auckland&st=nyt In Auckland, Life Is Alfresco]'' - ''[[The New York Times]]'', 5 October 1997</ref>

Day trips combining a meal in Devonport with a trip up [[Mount Victoria, New Zealand|Mt Victoria]] or an exploration of the military emplacements on nearby North Head are also very popular. Devonport is also noted for the popular annual event, the Devonport Food & Wine Festival,<ref>[http://www.devonportwinefestival.co.nz/ Devonport Food & Wine Festival] (official festival website)</ref> as well as for the Devonport Museum located near Mt. Cambria. 

The navy base at Devonport features strongly in the local character, with the North Shore City Council having signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Navy which recognises the developing partnership between them.<ref>[http://www.navy.mil.nz/visit-the-base/recent-activities/mou.htm Navy and North Shore City Council Join Forces] (from the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] website. Accessed 2008-05-11.)</ref>

== History ==
=== Overview ===

Around 40,000 years ago Devonport consisted of three islands of volcanic origin, [[Mount Victoria, New Zealand|Mount Victoria]], [[North Head, New Zealand|North Head]] and between them Mount Cambria (now largely quarried away).<ref name=devonporttours1>[http://www.devonporttours.co.nz/about.htm About Devonport 1] (from the devonpporttours.co.nz website)</ref>

The earliest evidence for ([[Maori]]) settlement dates from the mid-1300s (roughly during the same time as the landing of the Tainui [[waka (canoe)|waka]] which is commemorated by a stone memorial on the foreshore).<ref name="TRAVEL">''Set sail for adventure on dry land'' - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Travel: NZ Special Issue, Tuesday 06 November 2007, Page D7</ref> The last remaining significant Maori settlement in the area, on [[North Head, New Zealand|North Head]], was wiped out by rival tribes in the 1790s.<ref name=devonporttours2>[http://www.devonporttours.co.nz/about2.htm About Devonport 2] (from the devonpporttours.co.nz website)</ref> 

[[Jules Dumont d'Urville]], a French explorer, is to have gone ashore in the area in 1827, possibly as the first European.<ref name="TRAVEL"/> The first permanent European inhabitant was a pilot and harbour master stationed on [[North Head, New Zealand|North Head]] in 1836.<ref name=devonporttours2 /> The suburb of Devonport itself was first settled in 1840 and is one of the oldest in Auckland and the first on the North Shore. It was initially called Flagstaff because of the flagstaff raised on nearby [[Mount Victoria, Auckland|Mount Victoria (Takarunga)]]. For the first half century or so of its existence Devonport was geographically isolated from the rest of the North Shore, and was sometimes called "the island" by the local inhabitants.<ref name=fullers> [http://www.fullers.co.nz/index.php/ps_pagename/devonport2 Destination History - Devonport] (from the [[Fullers Ferries]] website. Retrieved 2007-09-14.)</ref> Only a thin strip of land beside the beach at Narrow Neck connected Devonport to Belmont and the rest of the North Shore peninsula. In the late 19th century the [[mangrove]] swamp that stretched from Narrow Neck to [[Ngataringa Bay]] was filled in to form a racecourse, now a golf course.<ref name=fullers /> A new road was built along the western edge of the racecourse allowing more direct travel to the north. 

On the southern shore, to the west of the centre of Devonport, a nearby deep water anchorage suitable for [[Royal Navy]] vessels, the [[Devonport Naval Base]] was established. [[William Hobson]], then the Governor of New Zealand, considered the sandspit-protected area a better choice for a naval installation than the shallower [[Tamaki, New Zealand|Tamaki]] waters on the southern side of the harbour.<ref name="TRAVEL"/> While some facilities have expanded and shifted in location over time, the area is still the primary base for the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]]. The Calliope Dock at [[Stanley Bay, New Zealand|Stanley Bay]], part of the base, was opened on 16 February 1888 and at the time was the largest dock in the [[Southern hemisphere]]. The suburb also had one of the oldest New Zealand shipyards, now part of the Devonport Yacht Club area.<ref name="TRAVEL"/> 

The main centre of the suburb slowly shifted west, to its current location around the ferry wharf.<ref name="TRAVEL"/> The settlement itself was renamed Devonport by 1859 after the [[England|English]] naval town of [[Devonport, Devon|Devonport]].<ref>Wises New Zealand Guide, 7th Edition, 1979. Page 83</ref> Devonport achieved [[Borough]] status in 1886 and was incorporated into [[North Shore City]] in 1989.

=== Ferries ===

The first [[ferry]] services to Auckland city began in the 1840s These were open sailing cutters operated by local seamen running passengers to the foot of [[Queen Street, Auckland|Queen Street]] Auckland's main road. In 1860 the first [[paddlesteamer]] ferries began operation.<ref name=devonporttours1 /><ref name=fullers /> 

These were in turn replaced by double-ended, screw-driven ferries in 1904.<ref name=fullers /> Both passenger and vehicle ferries operated on the Devonport run until the opening of the [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] in 1959. Immediately after the opening of the bridge passenger ferry services to other North Shore destinations (such as [[Northcote, New Zealand|Northcote]] and [[Birkenhead, New Zealand|Birkenhead]]) were cancelled as were all vehicular ferries. The Devonport passenger ferry was retained on a much reduced timetable. The majority of the ferries were scrapped, only a handful being retained until being replaced by more modern vessels. The last of the old-style double-ended ferries, the diesel-engined ''Kestrel'' (built in 1905), was retired from the commuter run in 1988 but still operates for cruises and sightseeing.<ref name=fullers />

Today, ferry services, subsidised by the [[Auckland Regional Transport Authority]],<!-- see that article for references --> are more numerous again. A crossing between the [[Auckland CBD]] and Devonport takes about 10 minutes, usually on the '[[Seabus Kea]]', a newer, double-ended ship purpose-built as a ferry.<ref name=fullers />

== Notable locations ==

Between the wharf and Mt Victoria is located the Devonport shops, the most prominent landmarks of which are:
*The Devonport Wharf; rebuilt in the 1990s and about to be redeveloped.
*The Esplanade Hotel; This is an elegant example of an 1890s seaside hotel, reminiscent of many an English seaside resort of the period. Recently restored.
*King Edward Parade Reserve; here are located the 1970s Public Library, the War Memorial [a bronze soldier figure] and under the Morton Bay Fig trees a charming 1950s styled bandstand.
*The Victoria Cinema; Built in 1912 and remodelled in the 1930s internally and externally in the  fashionable Art Deco Style, this is apparently the oldest cinema in the Southern hemisphere in continuous use but it is currently closed for renovations, having recently (2006) been purchased by the North Shore City Council on behalf of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz/?src=/your_council/news_releases/releases-2006/july/deal-sealed-on-victoria-theatre-faqs.htm|title=Victoria Theatre - FAQ's|accessdate=2007-06-14}}</ref> 

Recently, in July 2007, Devonport was given permission to be excluded from a list of local Auckland growth node centres. The [[Auckland Regional Council]] accepted that while it was encouraging intensified growth (such as higher-density housing) around transport nodes such as Devonport, the character and historical nature of the Devonport Wharf area would make such a designation inappropriate in this case.<ref>''[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10451947 Development gets thumbs down]'' - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Tuesday 17 July 2007, Page A9</ref>
