==Biography==
===Cartoons===

Between 1970 and 1980, Stef began his artistic career as cartoon illustrator. He mostly worked in [[Quebec]] where he founded Bambou magazine in [[Quebec City]]. He also worked for [[Belgium]]'s [[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin magazine]] and for Fripounet magazine based in France.

===Contemporary Painting===

In 1992, while living in [[Costa Rica]], strongly influenced by the naif style, Stef  moved to [[painting]]. His brightly colored canvases depict subjects in nature, with pure rounded motifs. Very quickly, he found a very personal style and created what he terms his own painting movement, the Happy Painting, an artistic concept based on [[simplicity]], very strong colors and <U+201C>[[joie de vivre]]<U+201D>.

A year later, in 1993, Stef joined his two brothers in [[Cambodia]]. The subjects depicted in his paintings evolved to portray daily life in Cambodia. His personal, very positive vision of the country, just out of [[civil war]], met immediate commercial success.

Stef is not attached to and does not receive support from any [[government]], association or artistic group.

In 1997, during the crisis in Cambodia, Stef was amongst the very few foreigners who still believed in the future of the country and stayed there.

The Happy Painting movement influenced a number of Cambodian artists. In a personal letter, HRH [[Norodom Sihanouk]], King of Cambodia, thanked Stef for his precious contribution to Contemporary Art in Cambodia.

In 2008, Stef made a 15 metre [[mural]] for the new [[international airport]] in [[Sihanoukville]]. In 2008, he represented Cambodia at the second Contemporary Art Exhibition in [[Malaysia]]. Stef<U+2019>s creations are currently in galleries in Cambodia, Malaysia, [[Singapore]] and [[India]].
