==2004 Congressional race==
{{seealso|United States House of Representatives elections, 2004}}
Mount ran for Congress in 2004 to succeed [[Chris John]], who had announced his retirement from the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] to run for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. She positioned herself as a conservative Democrat, supportive of balanced budgets and traditional social views,<ref name=Tauzin>{{cite news | first=David | last=Stout | title=Congressman's Son Trails in Close Race | date=2004-12-06 | url=http://nytimes.com/2004/12/06/national/06louisiana.html | accessdate=2009-01-07 | publisher=The New York Times}}</ref> emphasizing job creation, health care and her opposition to [[offshoring]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.klfy.com/global/story.asp?s=2463762&ClientType=Printable | title=Willie Landry Mount | accessdate=2009-01-07 | publisher=KLFY-TV}}</ref> Her major Democratic opponent in the [[Nonpartisan blanket primary|jungle primary]] was African American Don Cravins, father of [[Don Cravins, Jr.]] Her major [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opponent was [[Charles Boustany]], a retired heart surgeon, who ran on a platform of preventing tax increases and passing a new energy bill.<ref name=Tauzin/> The [[Louisiana Democratic Party]] was supporting Mount, as Cravins was believed to be a weaker contestant in a run-off.<ref name=LotP>{{cite news | title=Leaders of the Pack | date=2004-11-04 | url=http://timessw.com/archive/viewarchive.asp?SID=881 | accessdate=2009-01-07 | publisher=The Times of Southwest Louisiana}}</ref> Polls taken in late October had shown Boustany, Cravins and Mount statistically tied<ref>{{cite news | title=Louisiana district to be decided in December | date=2009-11-03 | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/11/01/HFR.house.louisiana7/index.html | accessdate=2009-01-07 | publisher=CNN}}</ref> and the election was hotly contested.<ref name=TA>{{cite news | last=Courreges | first=Patrick | title=La. senator to make bid for Congress | publisher=The Advocate (Baton Rouge) | date=2009-01-10 | url=http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/21654099.html | accessdate=2009-01-10 }}</ref>

In the first ballot on November 2, 2004, Boustany and Mount garnered the most votes; Cravins was defeated by less than two thousand votes. As both fell short of a majority, a second ballot was mandated. In the subsequent campaign, Mount criticized Boustany for favouring tax cuts for the rich and being indifferent to health care, while Boustany rejected the attacks as false and stressed his willingness to work with Democrats and Independents.<ref>{{cite news | first=David | last=Stout | title=Louisianians to Vote on Last 2 House Seats | date=2004-12-04 | url=http://nytimes.com/2004/12/04/national/04louisiana.html | accessdate=2009-01-07 | publisher=The New York Times}}</ref> Boustany in turn portrayed Mount as liberal and favoring tax increases.<ref name=AP>{{cite news | first=Adam | last=Nossiter | title=Low turnout expected in final two runoff elections in Louisiana | date=2004-12-04 | url=http://nctimes.com/articles/2004/12/05/election2004/16_45_3812_4_04.txt | accessdate=2009-01-07 | work=Associated Press | publisher=North County Times}}</ref> Mount also criticized Boustany for favoring the privatization of [[Social Security (United States)|social security]], an unpopular position in Louisiana,<ref name=TWT>{{cite news|title=Cheney lends hand in Louisiana races|date=2004-12-04|url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2004/dec/01/20041201-114749-8012r/|accessdate=2009-01-07|publisher=The Washington Times}}</ref> and as removed from the interests of voters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lord Boustany (2004)|publisher=Louisiana Democratic Party|date=2004|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ObxtFdDfpY|accessdate=2009-12-09}}</ref> She received endorsements by U.S. Senator [[John Breaux]], who had represented the 7th district for over fourteen years, and governor [[Kathleen Blanco]]. Boustany was helped by Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], who campaigned on his behalf in Lake Charles.<ref name=TWT/> Mount, however, was not endorsed by Democratic primary opponent Don Cravins, who complained about the state Democratic Party's endorsement of Mount in a partially party funded mailer that excluded him and which he believed contributed to his narrow loss.<ref name=JM>{{cite news | first=John | last=Maginnis | title=Open Primary's Victims Want To Close It | date=2004-11-18 | url=http://www.timessw.com/archive/viewarchive.asp?SID=887 | accessdate=2009-01-07 | publisher=The Times of Southwest Louisiana}}</ref> Cravins prepared a suit in federal court claiming that the state Democratic Party violated the [[Voting Rights Act]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Peter | last=Savodnik  | title=Civil-rights suit could sink Mount  | date=2004-12-01 | url=http://thehill.com/campaign-2008/civil-rights-suit-could-sink-mount-2004-12-01.html | accessdate=2009-01-07 | publisher=The Hill}}</ref>

In the run-off on December 4, 2004, Boustany won over Mount by 55 percent to 45 percent in an election with low general [[voter turnout]].<ref name=AP/> Democrats had hoped on a big turnout, as the district is nearly a quarter African American, a reliable Democratic constituency. Analysis of the race suggested that Mount's defeat was helped by the open primary system that had the Democratic candidates work against each other<ref name=JM/> and led to Cravin's conflict with state Democratic Party which in turn led to suppressed voter turnout.<ref name=TA/> The large number of negative advertisements was also cited as a factor that contributed to low turnout.<ref>{{cite news | title=GOP, Democrats Trade House Seats in La.

Bush]] in the presidential election in the district, which he carried by about 60 percent.<ref name=TWT/> Following her defeat, Mount ruled out another campaign for the seat, but not a campaign for another state-wide office.<ref>{{cite news | first=Reid | last=Wilson | title=The Futures Market: Louisiana | date=2006-01-31 | url=http://hotlineblog.nationaljournal.com/archives/2006/01/the_futures_mar_16.html | accessdate=2009-01-07 | publisher=National Journal}}</ref>
