'''''White Zombie''''' is a {{fy|1932}} [[Cinema of the United States|American]] independent [[horror film]] directed and produced by brothers [[Victor Halperin]] and Edward Halperin, respectively. The film's story is written by [[Garnett Weston]] which tells the story of a young woman's transformation into a zombie at the hands of an evil voodoo master. [[B<U+00E9>la Lugosi]] stars as the antagonist, Murder Legendre, with [[Madge Bellamy]] appearing as his victim. Other cast members included [[Robert W. Frazer]], [[John Harron]] and [[Joseph Cawthorn]].

Large portions of the ''White Zombie'' were shot on the [[Universal Studios]] lot, borrowing many props and scenery from other horror films of the era. ''White Zombie'' opened in New York to negative reception, with reviewers criticizing the film's over-the-top story and weak acting performances. The film made a substantial financial profit as an independent feature, it proved to be less popular at the box office than other horror films of the time.

''White Zombie'' is considered the first [[feature film|feature length]] [[zombie film]]. A sequel to the film titled ''[[Revolt of the Zombies]]'' opened in 1936. Modern reception to ''White Zombie'' has been more positive since its initial release. Critics have praised the atmosphere of the film, leading it comparisons to the 1940s horror film productions of [[Val Lewton]], while others still have an unfavorable opinion on the quality of acting from the cast.

==Plot==
On arrival in [[Haiti]], Madeleine Short reunites with her fianc<U+00E9> Neil Parker, with imminent plans to be married. On the way to their lodging, the couple's coach passes Murder Legendre, an evil [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] master, who observes them with interest. Neil and Madeleine arrive at the home of the wealthy [[plantation]] owner, Charles Beaumont. Charles' love of Madeleine prompts him to meet Murder secretly in Murder's [[sugar cane]] mill, operated entirely by zombies. Charles wants to convince Madeleine to marry him and solicits Murder's supernatural assistance. Murder states that the only way to help Charles is to transform Madeleine into a zombie with a potion. Beaumont agrees, takes the potion, and surreptitiously gives it to Madeleine. Shortly after Madeleine and Neil's wedding ceremony, the potion takes effect on Madeleine, who soon dies and is buried. Murder and Charles enter Madeleine's tomb at night and bring her back to life as a zombie. In a drunken state, a depressed Neil sees ghostly apparitions of Madeleine and goes to her tomb. On finding it empty, Neil seeks out the assistance of the local missionary, Dr. Bruner, who recounts how Murder turned many of his rivals into zombies, who now act as Murder's closest guardians. The two men journey to Murder's cliffside castle to rescue Madeleine.

At the castle, Charles has begun to regret Madeleine's transformation and begs Murder to return her to life, but Murder refuses. Charles discovers he has been tainted by Murder's voodoo and is also transforming into a zombie. As Neil enters the fortress, Murder senses his presence and silently orders Madeleine to kill Neil. She approaches Neil with a knife, but Bruner grabs her hand from behind a curtain, making her drop the knife and walk away. Neil follows Madeleine to an [[escarpment]], where Murder commands his zombie guardians to kill Neil. Bruner approaches Murder and knocks him out, breaking Murder's mental control over his zombies. Undirected, the zombies topple off the cliff. Murder awakens and eludes Neil and Bruner, but Charles pushes Murder off the cliff. Charles loses his balance and also falls to his death. Murder's death releases Madeleine from her zombie trance, and she awakens to embrace Neil.

==Production==
''White Zombie'' went into development in early 1932.<ref name="Rhodes89">Rhodes 2001, p. 89</ref>  The Halperins leased office space from [[Universal Studios]] to get their film (then titled ''Zombie'') underway.<ref name="Rhodes91">Rhodes 2001, p. 91</ref> The film's zombie theme was inspired by the Broadway play by Kenneth Webb titled ''Zombie''.<ref name="Grant">Grant 2004, p. 210</ref><ref name="Kay6">Kay 2008, p. 6</ref> The screenplay for ''White Zombie'' was written by Garnett Weston. Weston's screenplay focuses more on action than dialog.<ref name="Rhodes95">Rhodes 2001, p. 95</ref>   To aid the Halperins, producer [[Phil Goldstone]] helped secure funds for ''White Zombie'' as he had for other independent films at the time.<ref name="Rhodes91" /><ref name="Rhodes92">Rhodes 2001, p. 92</ref> 

''White Zombie'' was filmed in eleven days in March 1932 and was shot at the [[Universal Studios]] lot and [[Bronson Canyon]].<ref name="Rhodes104" /> Other than [[B<U+00E9>la Lugosi]] and [[Joseph Cawthorn]], the majority of the cast in ''White Zombie'' were actors whose fame had diminished since the [[silent era|silent film era]].<ref name="Rhodes92" /> By the time Lugosi appeared in ''White Zombie'', he was already popular with contemporary audiences after his starring role in the hit 1931 film, ''[[Dracula (1931 film)|Dracula]]''. Sources vary about Lugosi's salary for ''White Zombie''. Claims range between [[United States Dollar|US$]]500 to $900. Richard Sheffield, who was his close friend in the 1950s, reported a payment of $5,000 for ''White Zombie'' on Lugosi's tax returns.<ref name="Rhodes97">Rhodes 2001, p. 97</ref><ref name="Rhodes105">Rhodes 2001, p. 105</ref> The cast and crew's reaction to Lugosi on the set was mixed. Madge Bellamy recalled her collaboration with Lugosi positively, stating that he was very pleasant and that he used to kiss her hand in the morning when they'd come on to the set.<ref name="Rhodes98">Rhodes 2001, p. 98</ref> In contrast, assistant cameraman Enzo Martinelli remarked that "Lugosi wasn't really a friendly type" on set.<ref name="Rhodes98" /> 

Phil Goldstone had previously worked with Bellamy and offered her the role of Madeleine Short for a salary of $5,000.<ref name="Rhodes99">Rhodes 2001, p. 99</ref> For the role of Dr. Bruner, the Halperins looked for an actor with name value and decided to cast Joseph Cawthorn, who was then known to audiences only as comic relief in stage and film roles.<ref name="Rhodes100">Rhodes 2001, p. 100</ref><ref name="Rhodes100" /> Set designer [[Ralph Berger]] utilized the rented sets of previous [[Universal Studios]] films. These sets included the great halls from ''Dracula'', pillars and a hanging balcony from ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1923), the dark corridors from ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' (1931) and chairs from ''[[The Cat and the Canary (1927 film)|The Cat and the Canary]]'' (1927). In addition to Berger, assistant director William Cody and sound director L.E. "Pete" Clark earned their first film credit by working on ''White Zombie''.<ref name="Rhodes103">Rhodes 2001, p. 103</ref> [[Jack Pierce (make-up artist)|Jack Pierce]], Lugosi's [[make-up artist]] on ''White Zombie'', had been responsible for the make-up of several other famous horror films of the era including ''Frankenstein'', ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'', and ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1932).<ref name="Rhodes103" /><ref name="Rhodes104">Rhodes 2001, p. 104</ref>

The music of ''White Zombie'' was supervised by Abe Meyer. Instead of using pre-recorded music, Meyer had orchestras record new versions of compositions for each specific film he was involved in. The music in ''White Zombie'' draws from obscure works including [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s "Pictures at an Exhibition", Gaston Borch's "Incidental Symphonies" and [[Hugo Riesenfeld]]'s "Death of the Great Chief".<ref name="Rhodes109">Rhodes 2001, p. 109</ref> Other pieces on the ''White Zombie'' soundtrack include music written by [[Richard Wagner]], H. Maurice Jacquet, Leo Kempenski, and [[Franz Liszt]]. The film begins with "Chant", a composition of wordless vocals and drumming, created by Universal Studios employee Guy Bevier Williams, a specialist in ethnic music.<ref name="Rhodes110">Rhodes 2001, p. 110</ref>

==Release==
''White Zombie'' experienced distribution problems from the beginning, and went through several film studios including [[Columbia Studios]] and [[Educational Pictures]] before its initial release.<ref name="Rhodes111">Rhodes 2001, p. 111</ref> [[United Artists]] had been distributing several independent and foreign films that year and bought the rights to release ''White Zombie''.<ref name="Rhodes113">Rhodes 2001, p. 113</ref> A preview of ''White Zombie'''s first cut was shown on June 16, 1932 in [[New York City]].<ref name="Rhodes112">Rhodes 2001, p. 112</ref> This print of ''White Zombie'' had a running time of 74 minutes, whereas the regular distribution prints ran for only 69 minutes.<ref name="Rhodes194">Rhodes 2001, p. 194</ref>

===Critical response===
Most critical reviews focused on the poor acting and over-the-top storyline.<ref>Rhodes 2001, p. 266</ref> William Boehnel of the ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' stated: "The plot...is really ridiculous, but not so startlingly so as the acting."<ref name="R265">Rhodes 2001, p. 265</ref> Thornton Delehaney of the ''[[New York Evening Post]]'' wrote, "[T]he story tries to out<U+2013>''Frankenstein'' ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', and so earnest is it in its attempt to be thrilling that it overreaches its mark all along the line and resolves into an unintentional and often hilarious comedy."<ref name="R265" /> Irene Thirer of the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' wrote, "Many fantastic and eerie scenes are evolved, but most of them border on ludicrous".<ref name="R266">Rhodes 2001, p. 266</ref> Industry trade reviews were more positive. ''[[The Film Daily]]'' wrote: "It rates with the best of this type of film [...] Bela Lugosi is very impressive and makes the picture worthwhile".<ref name="R266" /> ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' wrote, "[The film] is certainly not up to the standards of ''Dracula'' or ''Frankenstein'', but the types of audience that go for horror pictures will enjoy it".<ref name="R267">Rhodes 2001, p. 267</ref>

National media outlet reviewers were generally negative. Frederic Smith of ''[[Commonweal]]'' opined, "[The film is] interesting only in measure of its complete failure".<ref name="R267" />  ''[[Liberty (1924<U+2013>1950)|Liberty]]'' wrote, "If you do not get a shock out of this thriller, you will get one out of the acting". In ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine, historical)|Vanity Fair]]'''s "Worst Movie of 1932" article, Pare Lorentz wrote about a "Terrific deadlock with ''[[Blonde Venus]]'' holding a slight lead over ''White Zombie'', ''Bring 'Em Back Alive'', and ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]''".<ref>Rhodes 2001, p. 268</ref> In the United Kingdom, press was mixed. ''[[Kine Weekly|The Kinematograph Weekly]]'' thought the film was "quite well acted, and has good atmosphere" but thought, too, it was "not for the squeamish or the highly intelligent".<ref>Rhodes 2001, p. 162</ref> ''The Cinema News and Property Gazette'' thought the film was for the "less sophisticated" and that the "exaggerated treatment of the subject achieves reverse effect to thrill or conviction".<ref>Rhodes 2001, p.163</ref> Years after the film's release, Victor Halperin expressed a distaste for his horror films: "I don't believe in fear, violence, and horror, so why traffic in them?"<ref>Rhodes 2001, p. 237</ref>

Modern critical reception has been mixed, with critics praising the film's atmosphere while deprecating the acting. ''[[Time Out|Time Out London]]'' wrote, "Halperin shoots this poetic melodrama as trance; ...The unique result constitutes a virtual bridge between classic [[Universal horror]] and the later Val Lewton productions."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/64531/white_zombie.html|work=[[Time Out]]|accessdate=October 6, 2009|title=White Zombie Review. Movie Reviews - Film - Time Out London}}</ref> ''[[TV Guide]]'' gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, comparing the film's atmosphere to [[Carl Theodor Dreyer|Carl Dreyer]]'s film ''[[Vampyr]]''. However, the magazine described the acting as "woefully inadequate", with the exception of Lugosi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/white-zombie/review/126963|work=[[TV Guide]]|title=White Zombie Review|accessdate=October 6, 2009}}</ref> Edward G. Bansk, a Val Lewton biographer, identified several flaws in ''White Zombie'', including poor acting, bad timing and other "haphazard and sloppy" film aspects. Bansk wrote, "Although ''White Zombie'' is a film with courage, a film difficult not to admire, its ambitions overstep competence of its principal players."<ref>Bansk 109</ref>

===Box office===
''White Zombie'' premiered on July 28, 1932 in [[New York City]]'s [[Rivoli]] theater. The film received a mixed box office reception at theaters upon its initial release, but was a great financial success for an independent film at the time.<ref name="Rhodes271">Rhodes 2001, p. 271</ref><ref name="Rhodes233">Rhodes 2001, p. 233</ref> In 1933 and 1934, the film scored big in small towns in the United States, as well as in Germany under the title ''Flucht von der Teufelsinsel''. ''White Zombie'' was one of the few American horror films to be approved by the [[Nazi]]s.<ref>Rhodes 2001, p. 233</ref> The popularity of the film led Victor Halperin to a contract with [[Paramount Studios]].<ref name="Rhodes266">Rhodes 2001, p. 266</ref> 

Opening on July 29, 1932 in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] and [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], the film grossed $9,900 and $5,000, respectively, following one-week engagements. ''Frankenstein'' and other contemporary horror films had grossed more in Providence, and the Indianapolis theater "wasn't too happy with ''White Zombie'', but what audiences saw it were pleased enough."<ref name="R269">Rhodes 2001, p. 269</ref>  In [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], ''White Zombie'' sold a record 16,728 tickets its first weekend on its initial release in August.<ref>Rhodes 2001, p. 162</ref> In [[Montreal]], [[Canada]], the film opened August 3 at the Princess Theater. The facade had been transformed into a "House of the Living Dead" and "zombies" walked atop the marquee. The film failed to gross its estimated $8,000 and earned only $6,500 following a one-week run at the Princess Theater. In comparison, ''[[Dracula (1931 film)|Dracula]]'' had grossed $14,000 at Montreal's  [[Robillard Block|Palace Theater]] during its first week in March 1931.<ref name="R269" />

===Home video===
''White Zombie'' was transferred from poor quality prints to VHS and Betamax in the 1980s.<ref name="Rhodes194" /> The film has been released on [[DVD]] from several companies <U+2014> including [[K-Tel]] and [[Alpha Video]] <U+2014> in varying image qualities.<ref name="dvdRelease">{{cite web|url=http://allmovie.com/dvd/releases/white-zombie-54346|title=DVD Releases for White Zombie|work=Allmovie|accessdate=October 6, 2009}}</ref>.<ref name="RoanGroup">{{cite web|url=http://allmovie.com/dvd/horror-classics-vol-1-white-zombie-6396|work=Allmovie|author=Buchanan, Jason|title=Horror Classics, Vol. 1: White Zombie: Overview}}</ref><ref name="dvdRelease" /> The book ''Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide'' described the Roan Archival Group's edition as the best DVD version.<ref name="Kay313">Kay 2008, p. 313</ref> The online film database [[Allmovie]] wrote a positive review of the Roan Group's transfer, stating the film "has never looked better".<ref name="RoanGroup" />

==Legacy==
''White Zombie'' is considered to be the first [[feature film|feature length]] [[zombie film]] and has been described as the archetype and model of all zombie movies.<ref name="Rhodes13">Rhodes 2001, p. 13</ref><ref name="Prawer171">Prawer 1989, p. 68</ref> Not many early horror films followed ''White Zombie''s Haitian origins style. Other horror films from the 1930s borrowed themes from ''White Zombie'', such as people returning from the dead and other elements of zombie mythology.<ref name="Kay5">Kay 2008, p. 5</ref> These films include ''[[The Ghost Breakers]]'' (1940), ''[[King of the Zombies]]'' (1941), ''[[I Walked with a Zombie]]'' (1943), and ''[[The Plague of the Zombies]]'' (1966).<ref name="Rhodes183">Rhodes 2001, p. 183</ref> These films all contain elements from ''White Zombie'' including the blank-eyed stares, the voodoo drums, and zombies performing manual labor.<ref name="Rhodes184">Rhodes 2001, p. 184</ref>

Victor Halperin directed a ''White Zombie'' [[sequel]], ''[[Revolt of the Zombies]]'', which was released in 1936. B<U+00E9>la Lugosi was considered for the role of villain Armand Louque, but the part went to [[Dean Jagger]].<ref name="Rhodes171">Rhodes 2001, p. 171</ref> Cinematographer Arthur Martinelli and producer Edward Halperin returned for the sequel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/revolt-of-the-zombies-41203/credits|work=[[Allmovie]]|accessdate=October 6, 2009|title=Revolt of the Zombies: Production credits}}</ref> Modern critical response to ''Revolt of the Zombies'' is generally unfavorable. In a review from ''''Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide'', the review declares that "[T]here's no experimentation here, only dull composition shots and flatly lit shots of yakking characters in a by-the-numbers plot."<ref>Kay 2008, p. 9</ref> [[Allmovie]] rated ''White Zombie'' three stars out of five, while it gave ''Revolt of the Zombies'' only one star and deemed it far inferior to the original.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmovie.com/work/white-zombie-54346|work=Allmovie|accessdate=October 6, 2009|author=Erickson, Hal|title=White Zombie: Overview}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmovie.com/work/revolt-of-the-zombies-41203|work=Allmovie|accessdate=October 6, 2009|author=Erickson, Hal|title=Revolt of the Zombies: Overview}}</ref>

''White Zombie'' appears in other forms of media productions. Film that include clips of ''White Zombie'' include [[Curtis Hanson]]'s ''[[The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (film)|The Hand That Rocks the Cradle]]'', [[Michael Almereyda]]'s ''[[Nadja (film)|Nadja]]'' , and [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]''.<ref name="Rhodes189">Rhodes 2001, p. 189</ref> The heavy metal band [[White Zombie]] appropriated their name from the film. The group's vocalist [[Rob Zombie]] spoke of the film saying "[It's] a great film that not a lot of people know about...It amazes me that a film that is so readily available can be so lost."<ref name="Rhodes190">Rhodes 2001, p. 190</ref> In 1997, the Janus company released a [[Scale model|model kit]] based on the Murder Legendre character.<ref name="Rhodes190" />
