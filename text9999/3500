'''Australia Day''', also known as '''Anniversary Day''', '''Foundation Day''' and '''Invasion Day''', is the official [[National Day|national day]] of [[Australia]]. Celebrated annually on 26 January, the day commemorates the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] in 1788, marking the start of British colonisation of Australia. Australia Day is an official [[Holiday|public holiday]] in every [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] of Australia, and is marked by the [[Order of Australia]] and [[Australian of the Year]] awards, along with an address from the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]].

Records of the celebration of Australia Day date back to 1808, with Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] having held the first official celebration of Australia Day in 1818. In 2004, an estimated 7.5 million people attended Australia Day celebrations and functions across the country.

Australia Day is often seen as controversial by members of the [[Indigenous Australian]] community, who see it as a celebration of their culture's destruction. 'Invasion Day' protests have been common since 1988, and many observers question the appropriateness of celebrating British colonisation.

==History== 

On 13 May 1787, a fleet of 11 ships, which came to be known as the [[First Fleet]], was sent by the British [[Admiralty]] from England to Australia. Under the command of [[Arthur Phillip|Captain Arthur Phillip]], the fleet sought to establish a [[penal colony]] at [[Botany Bay]] on the coast of [[New South Wales]], which had been explored by Captain [[James Cook]] in 1770. The settlement was seen as necessary because of the loss of the colonies in [[North America]]. Captain Phillip found Botany Bay unsuitable and with two ships proceeded a short distance northwards to [[Port Jackson]], which he declared "the finest harbour in the world". The site decided upon for the first settlement was at a location where there was a stream of potable water and some level land, unlike much of the steep and rugged foreshore. By 26 January 1788, the fleet was at anchor in Sydney Cove, the male convicts were unshipped and the flag was raised in the name of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. 
 
In 1808, the day was celebrated as the "First Landing" or "Foundation Day", as the colony had survived for twenty years, despite the initial hardships, deprivation and starvation suffered by the [[First Fleet]] settlers.<ref name="nsw-hist">{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiaday.com.au/studentresources/history.aspx#Chronology|title=Australia Day History|accessdate=2007-10-29|publisher=Australia Day Council of New South Wales}}</ref><ref name=Kwan>{{cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://www.australiaday.org.au/pages/images/CelebratingAustralia.pdf| title =  Celebrating Australia: A History of Australia Day | work = Elizabeth Kwan | publisher = Australia Day Council of New South Wales | accessdate = 2008-12-18}}</ref> The celebrations began at sundown on 25&nbsp;January, and lasted into the night, the chief toast of the occasion being [[George Johnston (New South Wales)|Major George Johnston]]. Johnston had the honour of being the first officer ashore from the First Fleet, having been carried from the landing boat on the back of convict [[James Ruse]].<ref name=Kwan/> Despite suffering the ill-effects of a fall from his gig on the way home to [[Annandale, New South Wales|Annandale]], Johnston led the officers of the [[New South Wales Corps]] in arresting Governor [[William Bligh]] on the following day, 26 January 1808, in what became known as the "[[Rum Rebellion]]". 

On 26 January in 1818, the 30th anniversary, Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] held a 30-gun salute at [[Dawes Point, New South Wales|Dawes Point]] and gave government workers a holiday<ref>[[Sydney Gazette]], 24 January 1818 (quoted in ''More Pig Bites Baby! Stories from Australia's First Newspaper'', volume 2, ed. Michael Connor, Duffy and Snellgrove, 2004, ISBN 1-876631-91-0)</ref> &ndash; a tradition that was soon followed by banks and other public offices. In 1888, all colonial capitals except [[Adelaide]] celebrated 'Anniversary Day'. In 1910, [[South Australia]] adopted Australia Day,<ref name=Kwan/> followed by [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1931.<ref name="nsw-hist"/> By 1935, all states of Australia were celebrating 26 January as Australia Day (although it was still known as Anniversary Day in New South Wales).<ref name=Kwan/>

The 150th anniversary of British settlement in Australia in 1938 was widely celebrated.<ref name=Kwan/> Preparations began in 1936 with the formation of a Celebrations Council.<ref name=Kwan/> In that year, New South Wales was the only state to abandon the traditional long weekend, and the annual Anniversary Day public holiday was held on the actual anniversary day &ndash; Wednesday 26 January.<ref name=Kwan/> The Commonwealth and state governments agreed to unify the celebrations on 26 January as 'Australia Day' in 1946, although the public holiday was instead taken on the Monday closest to the actual anniversary.<ref name="?NADCHistory">{{cite web | url = http://www.australiaday.gov.au/pages/page79.asp | title = History of Australia Day | publisher = National Australia Day Council | accessdate = 2007-01-27}}</ref> 

===200 year anniversary===
In 1988, the celebration of 200 years since the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] was organised on a large scale, with many significant events taking place in all major cities.<ref name=Kwan/> Over 2.5 million people attended the event in Sydney, and the year was the first celebrated with a public holiday.<ref name="nsw-hist"/> These included street parties, concerts, including performances on the steps and forecourt of the [[Sydney Opera House]] and at many other public venues, art and literary competitions, historic re-enactments, and the opening of the [[Powerhouse Museum]] at its new location. A re-enactment of the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] took place in Sydney Harbour, with ships that had sailed from [[Portsmouth]] a year earlier taking part.<ref name="nsw-hist"/><ref name=Kwan/>

Air Force aerial displays are held in some capital cities, and firework displays are common. In [[Sydney]], races are held, such as a ferry race, tall ships race and a surfing race across the harbour. [[Citizenship]] ceremonies are also commonly held on Australia Day. The [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] also makes an address to the nation.

On the eve of Australia Day each year, the Prime Minister announces the winner of the [[Australian of the Year]] award, presented to an Australian citizen who has shown a "significant contribution to the Australian community and nation", and is an "inspirational role model for the Australian community".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australianoftheyear.gov.au/pages/page11.asp|title=Selection criteria|publisher=National Australia Day Council|accessdate=2007-10-29}}</ref> Subcategories of the award include Young and Senior Australian of the Year, and an award for Australia's Local Hero.

Various [[music festival]]s are held on Australia Day, such as the Sydney [[Big Day Out]], the [[Triple J]] [[Triple J Hottest 100|Hottest 100]], and the [[Australia Day Live Concert]]. In the last ten years, a [[One Day International]] cricket match in the [[Australian Tri-Series]] has been held on Australia Day at the [[Adelaide Oval]]. Prior to that, a [[Test cricket|Test match]] usually started at the Adelaide Oval on Australia Day.

==Controversy==
[[Image:Australiadayprotest.jpg|thumb|right|An Invasion Day rally in [[Brisbane]], 2007.]]
For some [[Australian]]s, particularly [[Indigenous Australian]]s, Australia Day has become a symbol for adverse effects of British settlement on Australia's indigenous people.<ref name=MelbIndy>{{cite web |url=http://www.melbourne.indymedia.org/news/2004/01/61247.php|title=The relevancy of Australia Day|accessdate=2008-12-18|last= Toscano|first=Joe|publisher=Melbourne Indymedia}}</ref> The celebrations in 1938 were accompanied by an Aboriginal [[Day of Mourning]]. A large gathering of Aboriginal people in Sydney in 1988 led an "Invasion Day" commemoration marking the loss of indigenous culture. The anniversary is also known as "Survival Day" and marked by events such as the Survival Day concert first held in Sydney in 1992, celebrating the fact that the indigenous people and culture have not been completely wiped out.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/barani/themes/theme6.htm|title= Significant Aboriginal Events in Sydney|accessdate=2007-01-29|work= [[Sydney City Council]] website}}</ref> In 2008, an Invasion Day protester burnt the [[Australian Flag]], prompting calls for [[Flag_desecration#Australia|flag burning]] to be illegal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/01/29/2148354.htm|title='Invasion Day' protest ignites flag-burning debate|accessdate=2008-12-18|work= [[ABC News]]}}</ref> 

In response, official celebrations have tried to include indigenous people, holding ceremonies such as the ''Woggan-ma-gule ceremony'', which was held in Sydney in 2006 and honoured the past and celebrated the present; it involved Indigenous Australians and the [[Governor of New South Wales]].

===Invasion Day===
{{wikinews|Aboriginal Sovereignty Day Declared}}
In January 1988, the Indigenous people of Australia made a concerted effort to promote an awareness among other Australians of their presence, their needs, and their desire that there should be communication, reconciliation and co-operation over the matter of land rights.<ref name=ABCInjust>{{cite web |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200501/s1289372.htm|title= 'Invasion Day' protesters highlight injustice|accessdate=2007-01-29 |work= [[Australian Broadcasting Commission|ABC News]]}}</ref> To this purpose, during January, they set up a highly-visible [[Tent Embassy]] at a shoreside location at a point called [[Mrs Macquarie's Chair]] adjacent to the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Sydney Royal Botanic Gardens]]. The embassy, consisting of several large marquees and smaller tents, was manned by a group of Aboriginal people from Eveleigh Street, Redfern, and was organised with the co-operation of the local council's department of parks and gardens.<ref name=ABCInjust/> It became a gathering place for Aboriginal people from all over Sydney. One of the aims of the embassy was to be seen by the many thousands of Sydneysiders who did not know, and rarely even saw, any Aboriginal people.<ref name=ABCInjust/>

'Invasion Day' has been widely used to describe the alternative Indigenous observance of Australia Day. Although some Indigenous Australians celebrate Australia Day, Invasion Day protests occur almost every year.<ref name=AgeRecon>{{cite web |url= http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/reconciliation-can-start-on-australia-day/2007/01/28/1169919208491.html|title=Reconciliation can start on Australia Day|accessdate=2008-12-18 |work= [[The Age]]}}</ref>

==Suggested changes to the date==
Due to the controversy relating to 'Invasion Day', and the perceived inappropriateness of celebrating the arrival of the First Fleet,<ref name=MelbIndy/> there have been suggestions to change the date of Australia Day. January 1 was suggested as a possible alternative day as early as 1957, to commemorate the [[Federation of Australia]].<ref name=almanac>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wilsonsalmanac.com/austday.html|title=*<U+00D8>*&nbsp; Wilson's Almanac free daily ezine|accessdate=2008-12-20|publisher=Wilson's Almanac}}</ref> In 1902, the day after federation, 1 January was named 'Commonwealth Day'.<ref name=ageday>{{Cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/australia-day-in-question/2008/01/25/1201157665401.html?page=2|title=Australia Day in question|last=Hirst|first=John|accessdate=2008-12-20|publisher=[[The Age]]}}</ref> [[New Year's Day|1 January]] was already a public holiday, and Commonwealth Day did not gather much support.<ref name=ageday/>

Some have suggested making [[Anzac Day]], 25 April, Australia's national day.  However, many war veterans believe that Anzac Day is their day, and it is also a public holiday in [[New Zealand]], [[Cook Islands]], [[Niue]], [[Samoa]] and [[Tonga]].<ref name=fed>{{Cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-43698936.html|title=Fed: I don t support Australia Day Anzac Day merger: Beazley|last=Hildebrand|first=Joe|accessdate=2008-12-20|publisher=AAP}}</ref> The date of the [[Eureka Stockade]], 3 December, has also been suggested, but has not gathered significant support.<ref name=ageday/>

The date 9 May is also sometimes suggested, being not only the date on which the first Federal Parliament was opened in [[Melbourne]] in 1901, but also the date of the opening of the [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Provisional Parliament House]] in [[Canberra]] in 1927, and the date of the opening of the [[Parliament House, Canberra|New Parliament House]] in 1988.<ref name=MelbIndy/> [[Constitution Day]], 9 July is also suggested as a possible alternative, commemorating the day in 1900 when [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] gave her assent to the [[Constitution of Australia]].<ref name=edu>{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.educationau.edu.au/ksmith/2008/07/11/should-july-9-be-australia-day/|title=You are Never Alone &raquo; Should July 9 be Australia Day?|accessdate=2008-12-20|publisher=education.au}}</ref>
