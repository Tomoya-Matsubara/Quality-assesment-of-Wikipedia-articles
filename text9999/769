==History==
Benny Hinn was born in [[Jaffa, Israel]] to a [[Palestinian]] father[http://www.horst-koch.de/joomla_new/content/view/133/144/] and an [[Armenia]]n mother[http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/main_miracles.html]. He was raised within the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Church]], and attended [[Georges Vanier Secondary School]] in  [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], where he was known as '''Toufik Hinn'''.

He states that his father was the mayor of [[Jaffa]]; and that as a child, he was socially isolated and handicapped by a severe stammer, but was nonetheless a first-class student.<ref name="GoodMorningHolySpirit2">Benny Hinn, ''Good Morning, Holy Spirit'', chapter 2</ref> These claims, however, have been disputed by critics of Hinn.<ref name="Heretic">{{cite news

  | publisher =D Magazine  |date=2003-08   | url =http://www.trinityfi.org/press/heretic.html   | accessdate =2006-10-21}}</ref>

He has written that on [[December 21]], [[1973]], he traveled by charter bus from [[Toronto]] to [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] to attend a "miracle service" conducted by evangelist [[Kathryn Kuhlman]]. Although he never met her personally, he often attended her <U+201C>healing services<U+201D> and has often cited her as an influence in his life.<ref name="GoodMorningHolySpirit2" />

Hinn founded the [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] Christian Center in [[1983]]. In 1999, he handed the church (by the time renamed to the [[World Outreach Center]]) to '''Clint Brown''' and moved to [[Grapevine, Texas]], a suburb of [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], while maintaining the legal entity <U+201C>World Outreach Center Benny Hinn Ministries<U+201D>{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. His former church was renamed Faith World Church under pastoring of Clint Brown, who merged his Orlando church with Hinn's. 

Hinn is married to Suzanne Harthern and lives in [[Dana Point, California]].

== Ministry and theology ==
{{wikiquote}}
Benny Hinn promotes himself as a Christian healing evangelist and Bible teacher. He is the author of a number of best-selling inspirational Christian books. His thirty-minute TV program ''This Is Your Day'',  is among the world<U+2019>s most-watched Christian programs, seen on various Christian television networks, including [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]], [[Daystar Television Network]], [[Revelation TV]], [[The Christian Channel]], [[Vision TV]], [[INSP Networks]], and [[The God Channel]]. 

Hinn conducts regular "Miracle Crusades" <U+2013> [[revival meeting]]/[[faith healing]] events held in sports coliseums and stadiums in major cities throughout the world.

Hinn's teachings are based on [[Word of Faith]] theology which espouse belief in the inerrancy of the Bible, contemporary works of the Holy Spirit and the "perpetuity of spiritual gifts" which includes activities such as 'speaking in tongues', faith healing, exorcism, and consequential financial prosperity.{{Fact|date=May 2008}} The doctrine and practices regarding theological interpretation and worship which Hinn teach are only partly accepted by mainstream Christianity.{{Fact|date=May 2008}} While almost wholly accepted by the '''Charismatic''' Christian community (Christian believers who subscribe to the tenets of the [[Charismatic Movement]] and whom, according to a recent study by [[The Barna Group]], make up 46% of the Protestant church and 36% of the Catholic Church<ref>''Barna Group,'' [http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=BarnaUpdateNarrow&BarnaUpdateID=287 "Is American Christianity Turning Charismatic?"] Accessed 17 April, 2008.</ref>), there are many others in mainstream Christianity who do not subscribe to these particular beliefs. Specific concerns of Hinn's critics include a lack of transparency regarding his personal income derived from ministry, disputes as to substantial claims that the sick are actually healed through his ministry.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

==Criticism and controversy==
Hinn made a number of [[unfulfilled religious prophecies#Twentieth century|unfulfilled (religious) prophecies]] for the [[90s]], such as [[God]] will destroy America's [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] community in [[1995]] or the death of [[Fidel Castro]],<ref name="Fisher">{{cite web| url=http://www.pfo.org/prophecy.htm| title=PROPHECY OR PRESUMPTION?

Hinn also appeared on the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] in [[October 1999]] to claim that God had given him a vision that thousands of dead people would be [[resurrected]] after watching the network -- laying out of scenario of people placing their dead loved ones' hands on TV screens tuned into the station -- and that TBN would be "an extension of [[Heaven]] to [[Earth]]." Hinn has also claimed that [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] was a "superbeing" who could fly to the [[Moon]]; that God froze the [[Red Sea]] with his breath when he parted it; and that Christ would make a personal appearance at a crusade in [[Nairobi, Kenya]] in [[2001]].

In April 2001 [[HBO]] aired a documentary called "A Question of Miracles" on Hinn.
[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0447686/combined] The director [[Antony Thomas]] told [[CNN]]'s [[Kyra Phillips]] that they did not find cases where people were healed by Hinn.[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0104/15/sm.13.html] Thomas told the [[New York Times]] about Hinn's claims, "If I had seen miracles, I would have been happy to trumpet it . . . but in retrospect, I think they do more damage to Christianity than the most committed atheist."[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDE1131F936A25757C0A9679C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print]

In 2002, [[Joe Nickell]] of the [[Skeptical Inquirer]] wrote a critical analysis of Hinn's healing claims.<ref>[[Joe Nickell]], "[http://www.csicop.org/si/2002-05/i-files.html Benny Hinn: healer or hypnotist? - Investigative Files]". ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''. May 2002. FindArticles.com. 22 Oct. 2007.</ref> Nickell cited information that Hinn's cures have not been documented by independent reviews, and said "there is a danger that people who believe themselves cured will forsake medical assistance that could bring them relief or even save their lives."<ref>[[Joe Nickell]], "[http://www.csicop.org/si/2002-05/i-files.html Benny Hinn: healer or hypnotist? - Investigative Files]". ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''. May 2002. FindArticles.com. 22 Oct. 2007.</ref> 

In March 2005, [[Ministry Watch]], an independent evangelical organization which reviews Christian ministries for financial transparency and efficiency and advises potential donors accordingly, issued a Donor Alert stating that "the reported exorbitant spending of the Hinn family reveals that BHM has far more money than it needs to carry out its ministry" and advising Christians to "prayerfully consider withholding contributions to Benny Hinn" while praying for his restoration and repentance.<ref>[http://www.ministrywatch.com/mw2.1/pdf/MWDA_053105_BennyHinn.pdf MinistryWatch.com: MinistryWatch.com Recommends that Donors Withhold Giving to Benny Hinn Ministries]</ref> Benny Hinn Ministries is not a member of the [[Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability]].<ref>[http://www.apologeticsindex.org/h01.html Benny Hinn: Apologetics Research Resources</ref>

In [[November 2006]] the [[CBC Television]] show ''[[the fifth estate]]'' did a special titled "Do You Believe in Miracles" on the apparent transgressions committed by Benny Hinn's ministry.<ref name="FifthEstate">{{cite news

In December 2006, BHM sent out a mailing asking for donations towards a new [[Gulfstream G400/G450|Gulfstream G4SP]] jet valued at an estimated $36 million and costs over $600,000/year to maintain and operate.<ref>{{cite web

===Senate investigation===

On [[November 6]] [[2007]], [[United States Senate|United States senator]] [[Chuck Grassley]] of [[Iowa]] announced an investigation of Hinn's ministry by the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance]]. In a letter to BHM,<ref>{{cite news |

The investigation also scrutinized five other televangelists: [[Paula White]], [[Kenneth Copeland]], [[Eddie Long]], [[Joyce Meyer]], and [[Creflo Dollar]]<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/06/cbsnews_investigates/main3462147.shtml | title=Televangelists Living Like Kings? | publisher=[[CBS News]] |date= November 6, 2007 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-09-17}}</ref><ref>
