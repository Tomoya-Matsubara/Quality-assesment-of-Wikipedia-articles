[[File:OvermanCommitteeMembers.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.67|alt=Three white men in suits sitting at a table, with a chandelier hanging and a mirror in the background|Three of the five members of the Overman Committee in 1919 during hearings: [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[Josiah Oliver Wolcott]] ([[United States Democratic Party|D]]-[[Delaware|Del.]]), Chairman Lee Slater Overman (D-[[North Carolina|N.C.]]), Senator [[Knute Nelson]] ([[United States Republican Party|R]]-[[Minnesota|Minn.]])]]

The '''Overman Committee''' was a special [[United States Congressional subcommittee|subcommittee]] of the [[United States Senate]] [[Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Committee on the Judiciary]] chaired by [[North Carolina]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Lee Slater Overman]]. Between September 1918 and June 1919, it investigated German and [[Bolshevism|Bolshevik]] elements in the United States. It was an early forerunner of the better known [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], and represented the first congressional committee investigation of communism. 

The Committee's final report was released in June 1919. It reported on German [[propaganda]], Bolshevism, and other "un-American activities" in the United States and on likely effects of communism's implementation in the United States. It described German, but not communist, propaganda efforts. The Committee's report and hearings were instrumental in fostering anti-Bolshevik opinion.

World War I, in which the United States and its allies fought the [[German Empire]], raised concern about the German threat to the United States. The [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and the [[Sedition Act of 1918]] were passed in response.<ref>{{cite book | last = Venzon | first = Anne Cipriano | coauthors = Paul L.

In the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]] the [[Bolshevik]] party, led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], overthrew the Russian monarchy and instituted [[Marxism-Leninism]]. Many Americans were worried about the revolution's ideas infiltrating the United States, a phenomenon later named the [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]] of 1919-20.<ref>Murray, 15-7</ref>

The Overman Committee was formally an ad-hoc subcommittee of the [[Senate Committee on the Judiciary]], but had no formal name.<ref name="judiciary">[http://judiciary.senate.gov/about/history/PhotoGallery.cfm Senate Judiciary Committee Photo Gallery].

==Initial investigation==

[[File:Alexander_Mitchell_Palmer.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=Chest and head of a middle-aged white male in a suit|[[Alexander Mitchell Palmer|A. Mitchell Palmer]]]]
The Committee was authorized by Senate Resolution 307 on September 19, 1918 to investigate charges against the [[United States Brewers Association]] (USBA) and allied interests.  Brewing institutions had been largely founded by German immigrants in the mid-19th century, who brought with them knowledge and techniques for brewing beer.<ref name="Brewers">{{cite news | title = Overman Report Accuses Brewers | publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]'' | date = June 15, 1919 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9803E5D71F39E13ABC4D52DFB0668382609EDE | accessdate = May 21, 2010}}</ref><ref name="brewing3">Congress, ''Brewing and Liquor Interests'', volume 1, p. 3</ref> The Committee interpreted this mission to mean a general probe into German propaganda and pro-German activities in the United States.<ref name="hagedorn53">Hagedorn, p. 53</ref> Hearings were mandated after [[A.

{{pquote|We do not want to make this proceeding a mere sewer or conduit into which may be dumped all the accusations and charges and libelous statements, or suspicions, of various persons throughout the United States.|Senator [[William H. King]]<br>December 9, 1918|<ref name="brewing1596">Congress, ''Brewing and Liquor Interests'', volume 2, p. 1596</ref>}}
Hearings began September 27, 1918, shortly before the end of [[World War I]].<ref name="brewing3" /> Nearly four dozen witnesses testified.<ref name="1387and1385">Congress, ''Brewing and Liquor Interests'', volume 1, p. 1387 and volume 2, p. 1385</ref> Many were agents of the Bureau of Investigations (BOI), the predecessor of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). The agents, controversially<ref name="lowenthal37">Lowenthal, p. 37</ref><ref name="lowenthal40">Lowenthal, p. 40</ref> and usually erroneously,<ref name="lowenthal37" /> implicated high-profile American citizens as pro-German, using the fallacy of [[Association fallacy|guilt by association]].<ref name="lowenthal39">Lowenthal, p. 39</ref> For example, the Bureau chief labeled some people pro-German because they had insubstantial and non-ideological<ref name="lowenthal38">Lowenthal, p. 38</ref> acquaintance with German agents.<ref name="lowenthal37" /> Others were accused because their names were discovered in the notebooks of suspected German agents, of whom they had never heard.<ref name="lowenthal37" />

Many attacked the BOI's actions. The Committee heard testimony that it had not conducted basic background checks of the accused and had not read source material it presented to the Committee.<ref name="lowenthal38" />  Committee members criticized its testimony as "purely hearsay".<ref name="brewing2453">Congress, ''Brewing and Liquor Interests'', volume 2, p. 2453</ref><ref name="lowenthal40" />

==Expansion of investigation==

[[File:Fitzgerald Cartoon.png|thumb|left|alt=A scared man, labeled "SENATE", cowering under his covers in bed|''Trotsky'll Get You If You Don't Watch Out!''<br/>A [[political cartoon]] drawn by [[Daniel R.

On February 4, 1919, the Senate unanimously passed Senator [[Thomas J. Walsh]]'s<ref name="schmidt140">Schmidt, p. 140</ref> Senate Resolution 439, expanding the Committee's investigations to include "any efforts being made to propagate in this country the principles of any party exercising or claiming to exercise any authority in Russia" and "any effort to incite the overthrow of the Government of this country".<ref name="bolshevik6">United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', p. 6</ref> This decision followed months of sensational daily press coverage<ref name="clark16">Clark, p. 16</ref> of revolutionary events abroad and Bolshevik meetings and events in the United States,<ref name="Senate-orders">{{cite news | title = Senate Orders Reds Here Investigated | publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]'' | date = February 5, 1919 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9806E6D61039E13ABC4D53DFB4668382609EDE | accessdate = October 9, 2008 | format=PDF}}</ref> which increased anti-radical public opinion.<ref name="schmidt136">Schmidt, p. 136</ref> Reports that some of these meetings were attended by Congressmen caused further outrage.<ref name="Senate-orders" /> One meeting in particular, held at the Poli Theater in [[Washington, DC]], was widely controversial because of a speech given by [[Albert Rhys Williams]], a popular [[Congregationalist]] minister,<ref name="murray46">Murray, p. 46</ref> who allegedly said, "America sooner or later is going to accept the [[Soviet]] Government."<ref name="murray94">Murray, p. 94</ref>

Archibald E. Stevenson, a New York attorney with ties to the Justice Department, likely a "volunteer spy",<ref>Hagedorn 54, 58</ref> testified on January 22, 1919, during the German phase of the subcommittee's work. He said that [[anti-war]] and anti-[[Conscription|draft]] [[activism]] during World War I, which he described as "pro-German" activity, had now transformed into propaganda "developing sympathy for the Bolshevik movement."<ref>United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', 12-4; Powers, 20</ref>.  The United States' wartime enemy, though defeated, had exported an ideology that ruled Russia and threatened America anew. "The Bolsheviki movement is a branch of the revolutionary socialism of Germany. It had its origin in the philosophy of Marx and its leaders were Germans."<ref>United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', 14; Lowenthal, 49</ref>  He cited the propaganda efforts of [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]] and gave many examples from the foreign press. He told the Senators, "We have found money coming into this country from Russia."<ref>United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', 19, 29</ref> Stevenson has been described by historian Regin Schmidt as a "driving force" behind the growth of anti-Bolshevism in the United States.<ref name="schmidt138">Schmidt, p. 138</ref> 

The final catalyst for the expansion of the investigation was the [[Seattle General Strike]], which began the day before the Senate passed Resolution 439.<ref name="murray94" /> This confluence of events led members of Congress to believe that the alleged German-Bolshevist link and Bolshevist threat to the United States were real.<ref name="hagedorn55">Hagedorn, p. 55</ref>

==Bolshevism hearings==

{{pquote|Senator OVERMAN: Do you agree with what has been stated here that the Russian people generally, 85 per cent of them, are ignorant like children and do not know anything except what their rights are, or what they claim to be their rights?<br/> Mr WILLIAMS: I think that probably not more than 50 per cent of the Russian people can read and write.<ref name="bolshevik606">United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', p. 606</ref>}}
The Overman Committee's hearings on Bolshevism lasted from February 11 to March 10, 1919.<ref name="clark15">Clark, p. 15</ref> More than two dozen witnesses were interviewed.<ref name="hagedorn147">Hagedorn, p. 147</ref> About two-thirds were violently anti-Bolshevik and advocated for military intervention in Russia.<ref name="murray95" /> Some were refugees of the [[Russian Diaspora]]<U+2014>many former government officials<ref name="hagedorn129">Hagedorn, p. 129</ref><U+2014>who left Russia because of Bolshevism.<ref name="mcfadden296">McFadden, p. 296</ref> The overriding theme was the social chaos the Revolution had brought,<ref name="hagedorn129" /> but three sub-themes were also frequent: anti-Americanism among American intelligentsia, the relationship between [[Jews]] and Communist Russia, and the "nationalization" of women after the Soviet revolution.

Stevenson produced a list of 200<U+2014>later reduced to 62<U+2014>alleged communist [[professors]] in the United States.<ref name="hagedorn55">Hagedorn, p. 55</ref> Like lists of names provided during the German propaganda hearings, this list provoked an outcry.<ref name="lowenthal60">Lowenthal, p. 60</ref> Stevenson declared universities to be breeding grounds of [[sedition]], and that institutions of higher learning were "festering masses of pure [[atheism]]" and "the grossest kind of [[materialism]]".<ref name="pfannestiel13">Pfannestiel, p. 13</ref> [[United States Ambassador to Russia|Ambassador to Russia]] [[David R. Francis]] stated that the Bolsheviks were killing everybody "who wears a [[clerical collar|white collar]] or who is educated and who is not a Bolshevik."<ref name="murray97">Murray, p. 97</ref>

Another recurring theme at the hearings was the [[Jewish Bolshevism|relationship between Jews and communists in Russia]]. One [[Methodist]] preacher stated that nineteen out of twenty communists were Jews;<ref name="powers47">Powers, p. 47</ref> others said the [[Red Army]] was composed mainly of former [[Lower East Side|East Side]] New York Jews.<ref name="hagedorn148">Hagedorn, p. 148</ref> However, after criticism from Jewish organizations,<ref name="bolshevik381">United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', p. 381</ref> Senator Overman clarified that the Committee was discussing "apostate" Jews only, defined by witness George Simons as "one who has given up the faith of his fathers or forefathers."<ref name="bolshevik116">United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', p. 116</ref>

A third frequent theme was the "free love" and "[[nationalization]]" of women allegedly occurring in Soviet Russia.<ref name="nielsen30">Nielsen, p. 30</ref> Witnesses described an orgy in which there was no "respect for virtuous women";<ref name="lowenthal51">Lowenthal, p. 51</ref> others who testified, including those who had been in Russia during the Revolution,<ref name="lowenthal51" /> denied this.<ref name="lowenthal52">Lowenthal, p. 52</ref>  After one witness read a Soviet decree saying that Russian women had the "right to choose from among men",<ref name="bolshevik354">United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', p. 354</ref> Senator Sterling threw up his hands and declared that this was a negation of "free love".<ref name="lowenthal52" /> However, another decree was produced stating, "A girl having reached her eighteenth year is to be announced as the property of the state."<ref name="bolshevik475">United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', p. 475</ref>

The Senators were particularly interested in how Bolshevism had united many disparate elements on the [[Left-wing politics|left]], including [[anarchists]] and socialists of many types,<ref>United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', 14-8</ref> "providing a common platform for all these radical groups to stand on."<ref>United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', 34</ref> Senator [[Knute Nelson]] of [[Minnesota]] responded: "Then they have really rendered a service to the various classes of progressives and reformers that we have here in this country."<ref>United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', 34</ref> Other witnesses described the horrors of the revolution in Russia and speculated on the consequences of a comparable revolution in the United States: the imposition of atheism, the seizure of newspapers, assaults on banks and the abolition of the insurance industry. The Senators heard various views of women in Russia, including claims that women were made the property of the state.<ref>United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', 475</ref>

==Final report==

Released in June 1919,<ref name="Bolshevism-text" /> it was over 35,000&nbsp;words long,<ref name="Brewers" /> and was compiled by Major Edwin Lowry Humes.<ref name="Drastic-Bill" />

The Committee did little to demonstrate the extent of communist activity in the United States.<ref name="murray95">Murray, p. 95</ref>  In its analysis of what would happen if capitalism were overthrown and replaced by communism,<ref name="schmidt144">Schmidt, p. 144</ref> it warned of widespread misery and hunger, the confiscation of and nationalization of all property, and the beginning of "a program of terror, fear, extermination, and destruction."<ref name="schmidt145and146">Schmidt, pp. 145<U+2013>146</ref>  Anti-Bolshevik public sentiment surged after release of the report and ensuing publicity.<ref name="schmidt136" />

===German investigation===

[[Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff]], [[Karl Boy-Ed]], [[Franz von Papen]], Dr. [[Heinrich Albert]], and [[Franz von Rintelen]], among others, were Germans investigated for producing propaganda. All were previously evicted from the United States for being part of a German [[espionage]] ring. The [[United States Brewers Association]], the [[National German-American Alliance]], and the [[Hamburg-American steamship line]] were investigated. The final report concluded that these organizations, through financial support, bribes, boycotts, and [[coercion]], sought to control the press, elections, and public opinion.<ref name="Brewers" />

===Bolshevism investigation===

{{pquote|The [Bolshevik] Government is founded upon class hatred, its avowed purpose is the extermination of all elements of society that are opposed to or are capable of opposing the Bolshevist Party. 'Merciless suppression' and 'extermination' of all classes except the present governing class are familiar slogans of the Bolsheviki, and confiscation is adopted as an essential instrument in the governmental formula.|The Committee's final report<ref name="Bolshevism-text" />}}
The report described the Communist system in Russia as "a reign of terror unparalleled in the history of modern civilization".<ref name="schmidt145">Schmidt, p. 145</ref> It concluded that instituting [[Marxism]]-[[Leninism]] in the United States would result in "the destruction of life and property", the deprivation "of the right to participate in affairs of government", and the "further suppress[ion]" of a "substantial rural portion of the population." Furthermore, there would be an "opening of the doors of all prisons and penitentiaries".<ref name="Bolshevism-text" /> It would result in the "seizure and confiscation of the 22,896 newspapers and periodicals in the United States" and "complete control of all banking institutions and their assets". "One of the most appalling and far reaching consequences&nbsp;... would be found in the confiscation and liquidation of&nbsp;... life insurance companies." The report also criticized "the atheism that permeates the whole Russian dictatorship"; "they have denounced our religion and our God as 'lies'."<ref name="Bolshevism-text" />

Despite the report's rhetoric and the headlines it produced, the report contained little evidence of communist propaganda in the United States or its effect on American labor.<ref name="murray95" />

===Recommendations===

The report's main recommendations included [[deporting]] alien radicals and enacting peacetime sedition laws.<ref name="mccormick92">McCormick, p. 92</ref> Other recommendations included strict regulation of the manufacture, distribution, and possession of high explosives; control and regulation of foreign language publications,<ref name="reccomendations2">{{cite news | title = Senators Denounce Lawlessness | publisher = ''Casa Grande Valley Dispatch'' | date = July 18, 1919 | url = http://casagrandepl.newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewer.aspx?img=113405896&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=5&currentPage=0 | accessdate = October 9, 2008}}</ref> and the creation of patriotic propaganda.<ref name="mccormick92" />

==Press reaction==
The press reveled in the investigation and the final report, referring to the Russians as "assassins and madmen," "human scum," "crime mad," and "beasts."<ref>Murray, 97</ref> The occasional testimony by some who viewed the Russian Revolution favorably lacked the punch of its critics. One extended headline in February read:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9900EFDB1139E13ABC4F52DFB4668382609EDE&|title=Says Riffraff, not the toilers, rule in Russia|date=February 17, 1919|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=12 February 2010}}</ref>

On the release of the final report, newspapers printed sensational articles with headlines in capital letters: "Red Peril Here", "Plan Bloody Revolution", and "Want Washington Government Overturned."<ref>Murray, 98</ref>

==Criticism==
Critics denounced the Committee as a "propaganda apparatus" to stoke anti-German and anti-Soviet fears, feeding the Red Scare<ref name="sproule122+123">Sproule, pp. 122<U+2013>123</ref> and spreading misinformation about Soviet Russia.<ref name="clark15" />

The Committee attracted criticism from the public for its perceived overreach, and especially for publishing the names of those accused of association with communist organizations. One woman from Kentucky wrote to Senator Overman on behalf of her sister, who had been accused by Archibald Stevenson, criticizing the Committee for its "brutal as well as stupid misuse of power" and "gross and cruel injustice to men and women the full peer in intellect, character and patriotism of any member of the United States Senate".<ref name="lowenthal60"/> The Committee was compared to "a [[Salem witch trials|witch hunt]]" in one exchange with a witness.<ref name="bolshevik893">United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', p. 893</ref>

==Aftermath==
[[File:lee salter overman.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Torso and up painting of a plump middle-aged white male in a suit|[[Lee Slater Overman]], chairman of the Committee]]
The Overman Committee did not achieve any lasting reforms.<ref name="pfannestiel132">Pfannestiel, p. 132</ref> However, the panel's sensationalism played a decisive role in increasing America's fears during the [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]] of 1919-20.<ref name="schmidt144" /> Its investigations served as a blueprint for the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]'s anti-radical [[Palmer raids]] late in the year.  These were led by [[Attorney General]] Palmer, whose testimony about German brewers had been the catalyst for the Committee's creation.<ref name="mccormick92" />

On May 1, 1919, a month after the Committee's hearings ended, a bomb was mailed to Overman's home, one of a series of letter bombs sent to prominent Americans in the [[1919 United States anarchist bombings]]. It was intercepted before it reached its target.<ref name="mail-bombs">{{cite news | title = Find More Bombs Sent in the Mails; One to Overman | publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]'' | date = May 2, 1919 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9F07E1DB1E3BEE3ABC4A53DFB3668382609EDE | accessdate = October 9, 2008 | format=PDF}}</ref>

===Later investigative committees===
The Overman Committee was the first of many Congressional committees to investigate communism.<ref name="mittelman83" />  In the aftermath of the Overman Committee's report, the [[New York State Legislature]] established the [[Lusk Committee]], which operated from June 1919 to January 1920,<ref name="pfannestielxi">Pfannestiel, p. xi</ref><ref name="nielsen15">Nielsen, p. 15</ref> Archibald E. Stevenson was its chief counsel and one of its witnesses.<ref name="hagedorn231">Hagedorn, p. 231</ref><ref name="schmidt139">Schmidt, p. 139</ref> Unlike the Overman Committee, the Lusk Committee was active in raiding suspect organizations.<ref name="nielsen15" /> 

The Overman Committee was an early forerunner of the better known [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], which was created 20 years later.<ref name="schmidt136" />
