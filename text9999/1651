'''Will Geer''' (March 9, 1902 &ndash; April 22, 1978) was an American actor and social activist. His original name was '''William Aughe Ghere'''. He is known for his portrayal of Grandpa Zebulon Tyler Walton in the 1970s [[TV series]], ''[[The Waltons]]''.

==Personal life==
Geer was born in [[Frankfort, Indiana]], the son of Katherine (n<U+00E9>e Aughe), a teacher, and A. Roy Ghere, a postal worker.<ref>American National Biography: Fishberg-Gihon, John Arthur Garraty, Mark Christopher Carnes, American Council of Learned Societies, Oxford University Press, 1999 [http://books.google.ca/books?id=jiHFQUjyX78C&q=Katherine+AUGHE+GHERE&dq=Katherine+AUGHE+GHERE&hl=en]</ref> He was deeply influenced by his grandfather, who taught him the botanical names of the plants in his native state. Geer started out to become a [[botanist]], studying the subject and obtaining a [[master's degree]] at the [[University of Chicago]]. While at Chicago he also became a member of [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] Fraternity.

He began his acting career touring in tent shows and on river boats. He worked on several [[Left-wing politics|left]]-oriented documentaries, including narrating [[Sheldon Dick]]'s ''Men and Dust'', about [[silicosis]] among miners.

Geer was also the lover of gay activist [[Harry Hay]].<ref>Kevin Starr, ''Golden Dreams: California in an Age of Abundance 1950 - 1963'', Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 469</ref> In 1934, Hay met Geer at the Tony Pastor Theatre, where Geer worked as an actor. They became lovers, and Hay credited as his political mentor.{{Vague|date=June 2011}} Hay and Geer participated in a milk strike in Los Angeles, where Hay was first exposed to radical gay activism in the person of "Clarabelle," a drag queen who held court in the Bunker Hill neighborhood, who hid Hay from police. Later that year, Hay and Geer performed in support of the San Francisco General Strike.

==Early career==
Geer made his Broadway debut as Pistol in a 1928 production of ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', created the role of Mr. Mister in [[Marc Blitzstein]]'s ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]'', played Candy in John Steinbeck's theatrical adaptation of his novella ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'', and appeared in numerous plays and revues throughout the 1940s. From 1948 to 1951, he appeared in more than a dozen movies, including ''[[Winchester '73]]'', ''[[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|Broken Arrow]]'', and ''[[Bright Victory]]''.

Geer became a member of the [[Communist Party of the United States]] in 1934. Geer was also influential in introducing [[Harry Hay]] to organizing in the Communist Party. In 1934, Geer and Hay gave support to a labor strike of the port of San Francisco; the [[1934 West Coast waterfront strike]] lasted 83 days. Though marred by violence, it was an organizing triumph, one that became a model for future union strikes.<ref name="Bronski">Michael Bronski [http://bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/other_stories/documents/02511115.htm "The real Harry Hay",] ''Boston Phoenix'', October 31, 2002</ref> Geer became a reader of the West Coast Communist newspaper, the ''[[People's World]]''.<ref name="Denning">Denning, Michael, ''The Cultural Front: The Laboring of American Culture in the Twentieth Century,'' Verso (1998), ISBN 1859841708, 9781859841709, p. 14</ref>

Geer became a dedicated activist, touring government work camps in the 1930s with [[folk singer]]s like [[Burl Ives]] and [[Woody Guthrie]] (whom he introduced to the ''People's World'' and the ''[[Daily Worker]]''; Guthrie would go on to write a column for the latter paper).<ref name="Bronski"/><ref name="Denning"/> In 1956, the duo released an album together on [[Folkways Records]], titled ''Bound for Glory: Songs and Stories of Woody Guthrie.''  In his autobiography, fellow organizer and gay rights pioneer Harry Hay described Geer's activism and outlined their activities while organizing for the strike.<ref>Stuart Timmons, ''The Trouble With Harry Hay: Founder of the Modern Gay Movement'' (1990), p.64 & 67</ref> Geer is credited with introducing Guthrie to [[Pete Seeger]] at the 'Grapes of Wrath' benefit Geer organized in 1940 for migrant farm workers.

Geer did summer stock at the [[Pine Brook Country Club]] located in the countryside of [[Nichols, Connecticut]] with the [[Group Theatre (New York)]] studying under [[Harold Clurman]], [[Cheryl Crawford]] and [[Lee Strasberg]]. The artists took up residency at the lake in summer from 1931 until the early 1940s.<ref>[http://www.pinewoodlake.org/ Pinewood Lake website retrieved on 2010-09-10]</ref><ref>Images of America, Trumbull Historical Society, 1997, p. 123</ref>

==Blacklist==
Geer was [[blacklist]]ed in the early 1950s for refusing to testify before the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]]. In 1951 he founded the Will Geer [[Theatricum Botanicum]] in [[Topanga, California]], with his wife, [[Herta Ware]]. He combined his acting and botanical careers at the Theatricum, by making sure that every plant mentioned in [[Shakespeare]] was grown there.

==Later years==
In the late 1950s and early 1960s he played several seasons at the [[American Shakespeare Festival]] in [[Stratford, Connecticut]], where he created a second "Shakespeare Garden" on the theater's grounds.  By this time he was also working sporadically on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. In 1964 he was nominated for the [[Tony Award]] for [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical|Best Featured Actor in a Musical]] for ''[[110 in the Shade]]''.  In 1972, he  played the part of "Bear Claw" in ''[[Jeremiah Johnson (film)|Jeremiah Johnson]]'' along with [[Robert Redford]].  In 1972, he was cast as Zebulon Walton, the family patriarch on ''[[The Waltons]],'' a role he took over from [[Edgar Bergen]], who played the character in the pilot.  

Geer maintained a garden at his vacation home, called Geer-Gore Gardens, in [[Nichols, Connecticut]]. He visited often and attended the local Fourth of July fireworks celebrations, sometimes wearing a black top hat or straw hat and always his trademark denim overalls with only one suspender hooked.<ref>http://www.acorn-online.com/joomla15/columns/296-columnsreflections/52486-an-interview-with-will-geer-from-the-waltons.html</ref>

When Geer died, shortly after completing the sixth season of ''[[The Waltons]]'', the death of his character was written into the show's script as well.

His ex-wife, actress [[Herta Ware]], was best known for her performance as the wife of [[Jack Gilford]] in the film ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]'' (1985). Although they eventually divorced, they remained close throughout the rest of their lives. Geer and Ware had three children, Kate Geer, Thad Geer and actress [[Ellen Geer]]. Ware also had a daughter, actress [[Melora Marshall]], from a previous marriage.

As Will Geer was dying on April 22, 1978, of [[respiratory failure]]  at the age of 76, his family sang Guthrie's "[[This Land Is Your Land]]" and recited poems by [[Robert Frost]] at his deathbed. Geer's remains were [[cremation|cremated]]; his ashes are buried at the ''[[Theatricum Botanicum]]'' in the "Shakespeare Garden" in Topanga Canyon, near Santa Monica, California.

Geer was the inspiration for the character Ben Duane in [[Richard Yates (novelist)|Richard Yates]]'s novel ''[[Young Hearts Crying]]'' (1984).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
