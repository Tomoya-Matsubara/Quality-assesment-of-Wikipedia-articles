'''Ringette''' is a women team [[sport]] played on an [[ice]] surface. Played primarily by females, Ringette requires the use of straight sticks to control a rubber ring; with the objective of the game being to score goals by shooting the ring into the opponent's net. It was introduced by [[Sam Jacks]] in [[North Bay, Ontario]] in 1963.  It is played in countries such as [[Canada]], [[Finland]], [[the United States]] and [[Sweden]], with the largest community in Canada, with over 50,000 participants.<ref>Ringette Canada "About Our Sport" http://www.ringette.ca/Content/About/OurSport/AboutRingette.asp</ref>

==Overview==
===Players===
Only six players on each team are permitted on the ice at one time, usually one [[Centre (ice hockey)|centre]], two [[Forward (ice hockey)|forwards]], two [[Defense (sport)|defenders]], and a [[goaltender]]. However, a team plays "short-handed" (is "down" one or two players) when a player gets a [[Ringette#Penalties|penalty]] and must sit for a defined interval in the penalty box.  

A team may "pull" the goalie off the ice and substitute an extra attacker. If the goalie is pulled and the play returns to that team's defensive end, one skater may become an acting goalkeeper (AGK). Once she enters the [[Ringette#Crease|crease]], she is bound by the same rules as a regular goalkeeper.

===Free Pass===
The game begins with the visiting team receiving control of the ring on the defending half of the center circle.  One player from the visiting team must pass the ring to another player within 5 seconds or else possession is lost and granted to the opposing team.

===Blue lines===
Players are not permitted to carry the ring over the 2 blue lines; they can advance the ring over the line only by passing it to another player. The last player to contact the ring prior to it crossing is ineligible to play it in that zone until it either exits the zone or is contacted by another player on either team.

If a goaltender throws the ring across the blue line, a delayed [[Ringette#Violations|violation]] is signaled.

===Free Play Line===
The line at the top of the defensive circles is called the Free Play Line.  It marks the restricted area of each team's attacking/defending zones.  Only 3 players from each team, plus the defending goaltender, are permitted into the restricted areas.

Exceptions include:
* The defending team must have one player out of the free play area.  If a team has 2 penalized players, only two players in addition to the goaltender may be in the zone.

*  If a team has pulled their goaltender, an additional player is allowed into the attacking or defending zone.  The goaltender must be completely off the ice before the additional player is permitted to enter.

If the violation is non-intentional, the team in violation will lose possession of the ring and have it granted to the non-offending team.  If the violation is deemed intentional, a delay of game penalty is assessed.  If an intentional violation occurs in the last 2 minutes of the game, a penalty shot is awarded instead.

===Crease===
The crease is a zone in front of the goal mouth defined by lines on the ice. Goaltenders are the only players permitted in the crease. If another player goes into the crease while carrying the ring, the play is stopped, and the goalie receives the ring for a goalie ring. If any member of the defensive team goes in the crease, they cannot touch the ring within five seconds of passing through the crease, or possession of the ring is given to the other team. (In this case, the defending team still defends as normal, just with trying to not touch the ring.)

When the ring enters the crease, the goaltender then has five seconds to throw, pass with stick, hit, or push the ring out to another player. The goalie can pass the ring beyond the blue line using the stick, but if she passes it beyond the blue line by hand, her team must wait five seconds before touching the ring. If the goalie does not pass it within five seconds, the ring is awarded to the other team for a free pass from one of the free play circles. The goalie may use the stick to touch the ring outside the crease, and can also pass through the crease, but may not pull it into the crease. This results in a loss of possession,  and a penalty if shes already been given a warning.

The team in possession of the ring has 30 seconds to shoot, it is not always played this way with the younger girls (U12), or it gives up possession to the other team. The shot clock is reset when possession of the ring changes teams, when the ring stops in the goaltender's crease, or when the ring bounces off the goalie. The shot clock is only applied in competitive levels, starting at the petite level (10 to 11).

===Violations===
A violation is a minor penalty called for violations of game play rules, usually due to improper movement or handling of the ring.  Common violations include entering the crease or touching the ring on either side of the blue line.

If a violation is committed by the team in possession of the ring, play is stopped immediately.  The ring is awarded to the opposing team in the zone the violation occurred.  If a violation is committed by the team not in possession of the ring, a 'delayed violation' is signaled by the official (arm raised with a 90 degree bend at the elbow) and a 5-second count begins.  If the team in violation touches the ring within that time period, play is stopped and the violation is assessed.  If the count expires, the violation is dropped and play continues.

If a violation occurs that would award the defending team a free pass in their own zone, the ring is given to the goaltender as a "goalie ring".  Play resumes immediately when the goaltender receives the ring.  Time is not provided for teams to perform line changes as can be done on a free pass, although on-the-fly changes are permitted as in normal play.

===Penalties===
Penalties in ringette have the same concept as in hockey, with the notable exception that less body contact is allowed. Penalties are of the following classes:

* Minor penalties, such as boarding, charging, cross checking, elbowing, holding, illegal substitution, hooking, high-sticking, tripping, body contact, slashing, interference, delay of game, and unsportsmanlike conduct. The offending player must sit in the [[penalty box]] for 2-4 minutes depending on the severity of the penalty.  other exceptions apply. and her team plays short-handed.  The penalty ends if the team with the penalty is scored on, or the penalty time runs out.  (If the defense is serving two penalties, the oldest penalty ends.)

* A major penalty is assessed for serious offenses, generally involving intent to injure, such as slashing, body contact, and boarding. Major penalties are four minutes in length and do not end upon the scoring of a goal.

-- body contact, slashing, tripping, boarding, charging and any other physical contact penalty, and unsportsmanlike can become a 4 minute major penalty depending on the severity and roughness. Also, players can receive two penalties at the same time for a combination of four or more minutes. 

* Misconduct and Match penalties may also be called.  They result in a player's ejection from the game. Misconduct and Major penalties also incur a 2- or 4-minute fully served penalty to be served by a teammate, unless the penalty is assessed to a non-playing bench member.

If the team not in control of the ring commits a penalty, play is not stopped until the penalized team gains control. This is called a delayed penalty. A minor penalty is nullified if a goal is scored during the delay, unless penalties of equal class were called on both teams.

A team can work off at most two penalties at a time. If a team commits a third penalty, the penalized player sits in the penalty box, but her interval does not start until the first of the other penalties expires (and so forth if there are more penalties).  A team plays with a minimum of three skaters on the ice, regardless of the number of penalties. If freeing a player from the penalty box would give the team more players on the ice than it is entitled to (such as when the team is down to three attackers, but there are two other players in the penalty box), she will not be freed until a whistle stops play.  During the stoppage, the team must remove one player from the ice to return to its proper strength.

A team with two penalties can have only two players (instead of the usual three) in its defensive zone. But if a third person is active in the defenseive zone while two man down a third penalty will be called. If there is a third penalty that penalty time won't start till the first penalty is over. All three players may enter the offensive zone.

==Equipment==
Required equipment for ringette is: 
* ringette stick - can be wooden, plastic or composite, with rubber, metal or plastic tips.
* ringette ring
* player skates ( no figure / plastic beginner skates) - goalies may choose to use goalie skates
* shin pads (or goalie pads)
* protective girdle
* ringette pants - covering pants.
* gloves
* elbow pads
* jersey
* helmet with ringette facemask (must be a triangular mask, or another shape that a tip of stick cannot fit through)
* neck guard
* shoulder pads - in some associations/provinces, shoulder pads are optional after tween. In Ontario, shoulder pads are necessary until Open, other provinces may vary.
- also, in some places mouthguards are necessary too. 

The ringette facemask is much like a hockey one except the bars are situated so that the end of a ringette stick cannot enter the mask. (triangles not squares) 

Ringette sticks have tapered ends, with plastic, rubber or metal tips specially designed with grooves to increase the lift and velocity of the wrist shot. A ringette stick is also reinforced to withstand the body weight of a player - a ring carrier leans heavily on her stick to prevent opposing players from removing the ring.

==Differences from hockey==
Ringette is related to [[ice hockey]] in equipment and playing surface, but differs in rules and approach to the game. In hockey, puck handling requires agility and concentration. In ringette, the challenge is in catching or "stabbing" the ring. To catch a ring, a player must stab through the hole in the ring with the stick, usually while the player is on the move. Once stabbed, the ring is easier to control than a puck is, but ringette's blue-line rules force more passing. This makes ringette a game centered around skating and passing. As a result, players learn teamwork; a team cannot depend on one or two dominant players. The lack of "puck"-handling in Ringette allows players to focus on improving their skating, which increases the tempo of the game.  Increased control over the ring often results in higher scores, despite a ring being larger than a puck.

==Levels of play in Canada==
There are several levels of play in Ringette, categorized by age. Divisions were recently renamed as U* divisions under the new Long Term Development Plan (LTDP) rolled out nationally by [[Ringette Canada]] for the 2009-10 ringette season:

::'''U9''' under 9 years (previously called 'Bunny' division, a beginner's program for young children, boys are also able to attend
::'''U10''' primarily 8 & 9 years (previously called the 'Novice' division, but younger age players i.e 7 years old with well-developed skating skills can move directly into U10 division)
::'''U12''' 10 & 11-year-old players (previously referred to as 'Petite' division)
::'''U14''' 12 & 13-year-old players (previously referred to as 'Tween' division)
::'''U16''' 14 & 15-year-old players (previously referred to as 'Junior' division)
::'''U19''' 16- to 18-year-old players (previously referred to as 'Belle' division)
::'''18+''' 18 years and older players (previously referred to as 'Open' or adult division)
::'''20+''' 20 years or older players (previously referred to as 'Masters')
'''NRL''' Known as the National Ringette league, for elite players aged 18+

In 2010 the league put back in place previous age groups.( Belle instead of U19 etc.)

Boys are permitted to play at any age level but are restricted to competing at the "B" level or lower in many places.
Levels of competition, based on skill, range from recreational to competitive, and include: Rec, C, B, BB, A, and AA and AAA, with AA being the highest level at which league competition occurs.  AAA ringette in Canada is restricted to tournaments, such as the [http://www.canadagames.ca/Content/HomePage.asp?langid=1 Canada Winter Games], involving regionally or provincially represented teams. The [[National Ringette League]] was introduced in 2004-2005 season  and includes open-aged players at AA/AAA level. 

===National Ringette League  ===
{{Main|National Ringette League}}

The National Ringette League (also indicated by the initials NRL) is a elite league of ringette in Canada. The NRL groups together the best nineteen-year-old players at least of Canada. The NRL consists of nineteen teams separated into two conferences. The western conference has six teams and the east conference has thirteen teams. The LNR recovers directly from Ringuette Canada, the guiding organisation for the ringette in Canada.

=== Canadian championships ===

The Canadian Championships of ringuette took place for the first time in 1979 in [[Winnipeg]], , [[Manitoba]]. This tournament is conceived so as to be able to determine who are the Canadian champions in the categories Under-16 years, Under-19 years and Open (replaced by the National Ringuette League since 2009). The Canadian Championships of ringuette usually take place in April of every year. There were no Canadian championships in 2008.

=== Recent development ===
Canada Post will issue four stamps in a series entitled ''Canadian inventions: sports'' featuring four sports: ringette, basketball, five-pin bowling and lacrosse, ringette and five pin bowling holding the distinction of having been invented in Canada. The commemorative stamps were issued on August 10, 2009. The stamp will feature well-worn equipment used in each sport<U+2014>with a background line drawing of the appropriate playing surface.

== Ringette around the world ==

On the international scene, a half-dozen of country practise this sport, particularly there where the winter sports abound. The ringette leagues of level elite are present in [[Scandinavia]] and in Canada. We also find the ringuette of a way organized in [[United States]], [[Czech Republic]] and in [[Russia]] who, as Canada, [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]]  are  members of the Ringette International Federation established in 1986. Canada and Finland were always the most active ambassadors in the International Federation. Actually, Canadian and Finland teams cross regularly various countries to demonstrate how is practised this sport. Recently Canadian teams went in countries so remote as [[Japan]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. In 2012, the Ringette International Federation announces new promotion activities in [[Norway]], in [[Slovakia]], as well as in [[South Korea]]. 

== Finnish clubs ==

In 1979, Juhani Wahlsten introduces the ringette in Finland<ref> {{fi}}  [http://www.ringette.fi/fi/Ringetteliitto/Historia.html History]</ref>. Wahlsten creates some teams to [[Turku]]. The first ringette club was Ringettel<U+00E4>isi<U+00E4> Turun Siniset. The first tournament takes place in December, 1980. The Ringette Association of Turku established in 1981 and made come several Canadian coachs to make of the training and formation. The ski national week organizes then an annual tournament to collect all the ringette teams. The National Association of Ringuette of Finland is create in 1983. The tournament 1985 implies several girls' hundreds. It is then impossible to combine in a single event all the groups of age and all the categories of players. The visit of differents Canadian teams in winter, 1986 popularizes the sport. Today 10 000 Finnish young girls participate in clubs of ringuette 31. Several city have important clubs: [[Naantali]], [[Turku]], [[Uusikaupunki]]. 

The Finish ringette takes place amateur at the local level until the professional level with the  elite league  ''' [[Ringeten SM-Sarja]]'''<ref>{{fi}} [http://www.ringette.fi/fi/Kilpailutoiminta/Naisten+SM-sarja.html  Ringeten SM-Sarja Website]</ref>.

==Swedish clubs==
The ringuette is introduced in [[Sweden]] in the 1980s<ref>{{swe}} [http://www.lagsidan.se/uskringette/ history]</ref>. The first ringette club is Ulriksdals, in [[Stockholm]]. A national federation of ringuette was born in 1990<ref>{{swe}}  [http://www.sweringette.se/ Swe Ringuette.se]</ref> and the elite league  [[Ringettef<U+00F6>rbundet]] is established in 1994. The league groups together 7 professional women clubs:

More than 6 000 girls would be members<ref>{{swe}} [http://www.lagsidan.se/uskringette/ USK Ringette]</ref>.

==World Ringette Championship ==

At the beginning, the World Ringette championships are in every other year. But after the world championship of 2004 held in Sweden, the World Championships are in every three years. The winning national team takes gains the [[Sam Jacks]] Cup.

The first World Championships are held in 1990 at Gloucester in Canada: 3 countries are implied: Canada<ref>[http://www.ringette.ca/Content/Team%20Canada/Roster/Past%20Rosters/1990Roster.asp?langid=1 Player Roster Team Canada 1990]</ref>, Finland and United States distributed in 8 teams<ref>[http://www.ringette.ca/Content/About/Hall%20of%20Fame/Inductees/The%201990%20world%20ringette%20championship%20team%20.asp?langid=2 World Championships]</ref>. Finland is classified seventh and the United States eighth while Canadian teams monopolize the podium<ref>[http://www.ringette.cc/id119.htm Results]</ref>. 

The second world Championship takes place in 1992 in Helsinki, in Finland. There are in competition two Canada teams<ref>[http://www.ringette.ca/Content/Team%20Canada/Roster/Past%20Rosters/1992Roster.asp?langid=1 Team Canada 1992 Roster]</ref>, Finland, United States, France, Sweden and Russia<ref>[http://www.ringette.cc/id118.htm Ringette]</ref>{{,}}<ref>[http://www.ringette.ca/Content/About/Hall%20of%20Fame/Inductees/The%201992%20world%20ringette%20championship%20team%20.asp?langid=2 1992 World Championship]</ref>
 
The third World Championship is played in 1994  in [[Minnesota]], United States. There are two Canada teams<ref>[http://www.ringette.ca/Content/Team%20Canada/Roster/Past%20Rosters/1994Roster.asp?langid=1 Team Canada Roster 1994],</ref>, Finland, United States, Sweden and Russia<ref>[http://www.ringette.cc/id116.htm 1994 World Championship]</ref>. Finland won the World Cup, its very first world championship ringuette<ref>{{fi}} [http://www.yle.fi/elavaarkisto/?s=s&g=3&ag=68&t=&a=4589 Suomen ensimm<U+00E4>inen ringette-MM 1994]</ref>.

The 1996 World Championships take place in Stockholm, in Sweden. Canada<ref>[http://www.ringette.ca/Content/Team%20Canada/Roster/Past%20Rosters/1996Roster.asp?langid=1 Team Canada 1996 Roster]</ref>  wins the golden medal having undone 6-5 in extra time Finland<ref>[http://www.ringette.cc/id115.htm 1996 World Championship]</ref>. 

Since 1994, these two countries (Canada and Finland) quarrel the world title. Finland takes it in 1994 and in 2000<ref>[http://www.ringette.cc/id108.htm 1994 and 2000]</ref>, whereas Canada wins the golden medal in 1996 and in 2002<ref>[http://www.ringette.ca/Content/Team%20Canada/Roster/Past%20Rosters/2002Roster.asp?langid=1 Team Canada 2002 Roster]</ref>. The victory obtained by Canada in 2002 is particularly striking<ref>[http://www.ringette.cc/id107.htm 2002 World Championship]</ref>. Having been defeated by the score 4-3 in extra time against Finland in 2000, Canada takes its revenge by taking him against his rival by the score 3-1 in front of an arena swamp with 4,000 supporters in [[Edmonton]], Alberta. The finale match is  broadcast on CBC and followed by 544 000 Canadian televiewers.
