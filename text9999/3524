'''Cyclone Connie''' was a strong [[tropical cyclone]] that affected both [[Mauritius]] and [[R<U+00E9>union]] in late January&nbsp;2000. On January&nbsp;24, 2000, a tropical disturbance developed well east of [[Madagascar]]. Despite moderate [[wind shear]], it gradually strengthened while stalling offshore, and late on January&nbsp;25, was believed to have attained tropical storm status. After turning generally southeast, Connie attained [[tropical cyclone scales|cyclone intensity]] on January&nbsp;27. Rapid intensification ensued. Shortly after developing a well-defined [[eye (cyclone)|eye]], Connie attained peak intensity at 0000&nbsp;[[UTC]] on January&nbsp;28 as an intense tropical cyclone. Thereafter, Connie slowly weakened due to increased wind shear as thunderstorm activity quickly diminished around the eye. After threatening Mauritius, Connie then turned southwest, passing very close to R<U+00E9>union late on January&nbsp;28. After briefly leveling off in intensity that evening, Connie soon became less organized, and midday on January&nbsp;29, the eye became less defined. The next day, Connie weakened to a severe tropical storm. Despite forecasts of additional weakening, Connie maintained its intensity for most of January&nbsp;31. However, weakening resumed on February&nbsp;1 and the storm transitioned to an [[extratropical cyclone]] on February&nbsp;2. Two days later, Connie merged with another [[low pressure area]].

Despite passing well offshore Mauritius, both the airport and the port were closed due to lack of certainty in the storm's path. Connie brought several days of heavy rains and gusty winds to the island. One person was killed there and power was briefly disconnected. Overall, damage on Mauritius was minor. While passing near Reunion, Cyclone Connie brought heavy rains to the island nation. Power was knocked out to around 40,000&nbsp;individuals. Roughly 100&nbsp;homes were destroyed, leaving 600&nbsp;people were homeless. Another 300&nbsp;sought shelter.  Two people were killed, but damage in Reunion was minimal. The extratropical remnants of the system later brought flooding to [[Mozambique]], where 20,000 people were listed as homeless.

On January&nbsp;22, an area of disturbed weather developed around 10<U+00B0>S to 15<U+00B0>S, a prime location for [[tropical cyclone formation]] within the [[tropical cyclone basin|basin]]. Although the system gradually became better organized, moderate easterly [[wind shear]] prevented significant development.<ref name="MFR">{{cite report|title=Cyclone Season 1999<U+2013>2000|url=http://www.meteo.fr/temps/domtom/La_Reunion/webcmrs9.0/anglais/archives/publications/saisons_cycloniques/index19992000.html|work=RSMC La Reunion|publisher=Meteo-France|accessdate=July 18, 2014}}</ref> By January&nbsp;24 this area was located approximately {{convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=5}} east of the northern tip of [[Madagascar]].<ref name="gp"/> Following a significant increase in organization due to decreased wind shear,<ref name="MFR"/> the [[M<U+00E9>t<U+00E9>o-France]] office in Reunion (MFR){{#tag:ref|The [[M<U+00E9>t<U+00E9>o-France]] office in [[R<U+00E9>union]] is the official [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] for the [[South-West Indian Ocean tropical cyclone climatology|basin]].<ref name="nhc">{{cite report|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|date=November 9, 2011|title=Worldwide Tropical Cyclone Centers|accessdate=July 18, 2014|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutrsmc.shtml}}</ref>|group="nb"}} upgraded the system into Tropical Disturbance&nbsp;4.

Situated in an environment of favorable wind shear, Connie steadily became better organized. It quickly developed [[rainband]]s and good [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]]. At first, Connie was nearly stationary but on January&nbsp;26,<ref name="gp"/> moved northeastward under the influence of a [[subtropical ridge]].<ref name="MFR"/> Tropical Cyclone Connie slowly strengthened,<ref name="gp"/> although this process was slowed due to upwelling of cold ocean waters.<ref name="MFR"/> That morning, the JTWC upgraded Connie to a {{convert|120|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}} hurricane.<ref name="IBTRACS">{{cite report|author=Kenneth R.

Despite the eye feature, MFR assessed the intensity at {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}}. Early the next day, however, MFR classified Connie as a severe tropical storm following satellite data, which suggested that Connie had developed an 80% closed eyewall. Moving east-southeast, Connie was upgraded to [[tropical cyclone scales|cyclone intensity]] at noon on January&nbsp;27. Meanwhile, the JTWC revised the storms intensity to {{convert|160|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}}, equivalent to a low-end Category&nbsp;2 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale]] (SSHWS) roughly {{convert|780|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=5}} north-northwest of [[Mauritius]].<ref name="gp"/>

With an [[ridge (meteorology)|upper-level high]] located near the cyclone, the tropical cyclone steadily became better organized and thus Connie began to strengthen rapidly,<ref name="gp"/> as previously indicated by many [[tropical cyclone forecast model]]s. The system then began to slowly turn southeast in the general direction of Mauritius and R<U+00E9>union.<ref name="MFR"/> By 1800&nbsp;UTC on January&nbsp;27, Tropical Cyclone Connie developed a very well defined eye;<ref name="gp"/> based on this, MFR upgraded Connie to a very intense tropical cyclone.<ref name="MFR"/> Around this time, the JTWC raised the intensity of Connie to {{convert|215|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}}, equal to a borderline Category&nbsp;4 hurricane on the SSHWS, based on [[Dvorak technique|Dvorak intensity estimates]] of T5.5 and T6.0.<ref name="gp"/> After passing around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=5}} north-northwest of Mauritius, Connie then decelerated east-southeast.<ref name="MFR"/> At 0000&nbsp;UTC on January&nbsp;28, MFR estimated that Connie attained its peak intensity of {{convert|185|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}}. Despite this cloud tops associated with Connie began to warm, even though the eye remained well-defined. Thus, the JTWC lowered the intensity of Connie to {{convert|190|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}}, based on a blend of satellite intensity estimates.<ref name="gp"/>

Early on January&nbsp;28, Connie made its closest approach to [[St. Brandon]] and initially appeared to be approaching Mauritius. However, many computer models correctly predicted Connie to turn southwest and threaten Reunion. Throughout the day, Connie maintained its intensity, but by the evening on January&nbsp;28, thunderstorm activity diminished and the cloud structure became less organized,<ref name="MFR"/> though the storm maintained a small eye. Increased southerly wind shear from a [[Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough]] (TUTT) took toll on the system. During the morning hours of January&nbsp;29 both agencies reduced the intensity to {{convert|145|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}} as the storm began to encounter dry air.<ref name="gp"/> By the afternoon, MFR downgraded Connie to tropical cyclone status; the eye had become cloud-filled, although it was still visible on [[radar]]. That night, the storm passed {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=5}} northwest of Reunion. Early on January&nbsp;30, MFR downgraded Connie to a severe tropical storm.<ref name="MFR"/> Later that day, the JTWC estimated that Connie lost hurricane-force winds roughly {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=5}} east of the southern tip of Madagascar; all of the storm's deep convection by this time was displaced to the south.<ref name="gp"/>

After moving away from Reunion, Connie accelerated towards the south around a subtropical ridge situated near [[Amsterdam Island]].<ref name="MFR"/> On January&nbsp;31, Connie turned southeast, steered about a [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] to the southeast.<ref name="gp"/> Contrary to forecasts which predicted continued weakening, MFR kept the intensity at {{convert|105|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}} for most of January&nbsp;31. Based on satellite derived intensity estimates, the JTWC briefly re-upgraded Connie to a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane equivalent on the SSHWS at 1800&nbsp;UTC. However, the re-strengthening trend was short lived<ref name="gp"/> due to increased northwesterly wind shear.<ref name="MFR"/> Satellite imagery early on February&nbsp;1 revealed an exposed circulation and a rapid decreased of thunderstorm activity in bothy coverage and intensity. Based on this and the fact that the storm appeared to be losing tropical characteristics, MFR issued its final advisory on Connie. However, the JTWC continued to track Connie until February&nbsp;2,<ref name="gp"/> when it merged with an [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical low]].<ref name="MFR"/> At the time of dissipation, the JTWC assessed the intensity of Connie at {{convert|50|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}}.<ref name="gp"/>

==Impact==
Despite large uncertainty in the storm's path, the international airport on the eastern side of Mauritius and all ships within the [[Port Louis]] harbor had departed.<ref name=AP1>{{cite news|title=State radio reports that Cyclone Connie headed for Mauritius|agency=Associated Press|date=January 28, 2000}}</ref> A [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|cyclone warning]] was declared and 165 shelters were opened.

However, on the afternoon on of January 29 all sea and airports were re-opened and power was turned back on as the storm moved away.<ref name=AP2>{{cite news|title=Cyclone misses Mauritius, causes heavy rains and winds|agency=Associated Press|date=January 29, 2000}}</ref>
 
While making its closet approach to Mauritius on January&nbsp;28, Connie brought heavy rains and strong winds to the archipelago. Winds greater than {{convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} were recorded through much of the island, including a peak of {{convert|134|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in [[M<U+00E9>dine Camp de Masque|M<U+00E9>dine]]. During a six day period from January&nbsp;26 to January&nbsp;31, many locations along the eastern portion of the island received {{convert|600|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=5}}, equivalent to approximately a month's worth of rainfall, including a maximum rainfall of {{convert|647|mm|in|abbr=on}}. These rains helped relived extreme drought conditions. Offshore, waves up to {{convert|7.95|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height were reported.<ref name="MFR"/> One man perished on his roof while trying to fix his antenna.<ref name=AP3>{{cite news|title=Cyclone kills two, destroys hundreds of homes on island|agency=Associated Press|date=January 30, 2000}}</ref> Two rivers were flooded but all in all, damage was minimal.<ref name="AP2"/>

Due to its slow motion, Intense Tropical cyclone Connie deluged Reunion with heavy rains for several days before suddenly tampering off on January&nbsp;29. Throughout the passage of the cyclone, many locations recorded wind gusts in excess of {{convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, highlighted by {{convert|133|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in Le Port, {{convert|155|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}} in Peite France, and {{convert|21|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in Maida. Moreover, a peak rainfall total of {{convert|1752|mm|in|abbr=on}} was measured in Commerson, {{convert|1296|mm|in|abbr=on}} of which occurred in a 24&nbsp;hour time frame. Many roads across Reunion were damaged.

The non-tropical remnants of Connie brought flooding to [[Southern Africa]] for several days. In [[Maputo]], {{convert|328|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain fell within a day. Large sections of many neighborhoods were inundated. Roughly 20,000&nbsp;people were rendered homeless. The road that linked Maputo to [[South Africa]] was cut. The Ministry of Education was forced to delay the start of the [[school year]]. Following the floods, roughly 20&nbsp;[[emergency shelter]]s were opened. These rains help set the stage for additional flooding caused by [[Cyclone Leon-Eline]] and [[Cyclone Hudah]].<ref name=IU>{{cite book|title=Mozambique & the Great Flood of 2000|publisher=Indianan University Press|year=2001|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HWqjGAzoALYC&pg=PR16&lpg=PR16&dq=Cyclone+Connie&source=bl&ots=Qvgu3lgYSg&sig=Orsn-AOzk6qZm991ELy10cNl0wA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3_TLU5uqG8LgoASu-4GYCQ&ved=0CIYBEOgBMBA#v=onepage&q=Cyclone%20Connie&f=false|author=Frances Christie and Joseph Halon}}</ref>
