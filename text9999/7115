'''HMS''' '''''Black Prince''''' was a {{sclass|Duke of Edinburgh|cruiser|0}} [[armoured cruiser]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the mid-1900s. She was stationed in the [[Mediterranean]] when the [[World War I|First World War]] began and participated in the [[pursuit of Goeben and Breslau|pursuit]] of the German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben}} and [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Breslau}}. After the German ships reached [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] waters, the ship was sent to the [[Red Sea]] in mid-August to protect troop convoys arriving from India and to search for German merchant ships. After capturing two ships, ''Black Prince'' was transferred to the [[Grand Fleet]] in December 1914 and was sunk during the [[Battle of Jutland]] in May 1916, with all hands killed.

==Design and description==
Two [[armoured cruiser]]s of a new design, HMS ''Duke of Edinburgh'' and ''Black Prince'', the latter named for [[Edward, the Black Prince]], were ordered for the [[Royal Navy]] as part of the 1902<U+2013>03 Naval Estimates. They were the first ships to be designed for the Royal Navy under the supervision of the new [[Director of Naval Construction]], Sir [[Philip Watts (naval architect)|Philip Watts]]. The new design was significantly larger than the previous [[Monmouth class cruiser|''Monmouth'']] and [[Devonshire class cruiser (1903)|''Devonshire'']] class cruisers, mounting a heavier main armament of six {{convert|9.2|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} guns in single turrets.<ref name="conways I p71">Chesneau and Kolesnik 1979, p. 71.</ref><ref name="Brown p161">Brown 2003, p. 161.</ref>

''Duke of Edinburgh'' displaced {{convert|12590|LT|t}} as built and {{convert|13965|LT|t}} fully loaded. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|505|ft|6|in|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|73|ft|6|in|m|1}} and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|27|ft|m|1}}. She was powered by four-cylinder [[Compound engine#Multiple expansion engines|triple-expansion steam engine]]s, driving two shafts, which produced a total of {{convert|23000|ihp|lk=in}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|23|kn|lk=in}}. The engines were powered by 20 [[Babcock and Wilcox|Babcock & Wilcox]] [[water-tube boiler]]s and six cylindrical boilers. The ship carried a maximum of {{convert|2150|LT|t}} of coal and an additional {{convert|600|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, she could steam for {{convert|8130|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. The ship's complement was 789 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=p2>Parkes 1990, p. 442.</ref>

Her main armament consisted of six [[BL 9.2 inch gun Mk IX - X|BL 9.2-inch Mk X guns]] in single [[turret]]s, two on the centreline and two on each beam, giving a broadside of four 9.2 in guns. Her secondary armament of four [[BL 6 inch Mk XI naval gun|BL 6-inch Mark XI guns]] was arranged in single casemates. They were mounted amidships on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather. Twenty Vickers QF [[Ordnance QF 3 pounder Vickers|3-pounders]] were fitted, six on turret roofs and fourteen in the superstructure. The ship also mounted three submerged [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch]] [[torpedo tube]]s.<ref>Parkes 1990, pp. 442<U+2013>443.</ref>

==Operational history==
''Black Prince'' was [[Keel#Structural keels|laid down]] on 3 June 1903 at the [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company]]'s shipyard at [[Blackwall, London]]. She was launched on 8 November 1904 and completed on 17 March 1906.<ref name="conways I p71"/> When completed, ''Black Prince'' served with the 2nd Squadron until 1907, the 1st Cruiser Squadron from 1907<U+2013>1908, the 5th Cruiser Squadron (as part of the Atlantic Fleet) from 1908<U+2013>1912 and the Third from 1912<U+2013>1913.<ref name="conways 2 p13">Gardiner and Gray 1985, p. 13.</ref>

At the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]], the ''Black Prince'' was one of the four armoured cruisers serving in the [[1st Cruiser Squadron]] of the Mediterranean Fleet, commanded by [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Ernest Troubridge|Ernest Charles Thomas Troubridge]]. She participated in the pursuit of ''Goeben'' and ''Breslau''. Following the escape of the two German ships to neutral [[Turkey]], ''Black Prince''  and ''Duke of Edinburgh'' were sent into the [[Red Sea]] to search for German merchant ships, with ''Black Prince'' capturing the German [[ocean liner]]s ''S<U+00FC>dmark'' and ''Istria''.<ref name="conways 2 p13"/> On 6 November, she was ordered to [[Gibraltar]] to join a squadron of French and British ships to search for German warships still at sea off the African coast. This was cancelled on 19 November after the location of the German [[East Asia Squadron]] was revealed by survivors of the [[Battle of Coronel]].<ref>Corbett 1938, I, p. 371, 406<U+2013>407.</ref> ''Black Prince'' joined the Grand Fleet in December 1914 and was assigned to the [[1st Cruiser Squadron]] under [[Rear-Admiral]] Sir [[Robert Keith Arbuthnot]].<ref>Corbett 1929, II, p. 418.</ref>

''Black Prince'' was modified in March 1916 as a result of lessons learned at the [[Battle of Coronel]], with the 6-inch guns removed from their casemates and replaced by six 6-inch guns mounted individually behind shields between the beam 9.2-inch turrets.<ref name="conways 2 p13"/><ref name="Brown p161-2">Brown 2003, pp. 161<U+2013>162.</ref>

The ship participated in the [[Battle of Jutland]], where she was sunk with heavy loss of life. The circumstances under which she sank were mysterious for some years after. As the British had lost contact and did not see the ship destroyed, they were unsure as to whether a submarine or surface ship was responsible for sinking the ''Black Prince''.<ref>Jellicoe 1919, p. 477.</ref> During the battle, the First Cruiser Squadron was deployed as part of a screening force several miles ahead of the main force of the Grand Fleet,<ref name="Campbell p36">Campbell 1998, p.36.</ref> but ''Black Prince'' lost contact with the rest of the Squadron as it came into contact with German forces, at about 17:42.<ref name="Campbell p122">Campbell 1998, p.122.</ref> Soon after, two other members of the First Cruiser Squadron, [[HMS Defence (1907)|HMS ''Defence'']] and [[HMS Warrior (1905)|HMS ''Warrior'']] were heavily engaged by German battleships and battlecruisers, with ''Defence'' blowing up and ''Warrior'' receiving heavy damage, which later caused her to sink.<ref name="Campbell p152-3">Campbell 1998, pp. 152<U+2013>153.</ref> 

===Loss===
There were no positive sightings of ''Black Prince'' by the British fleet after that, although a wireless signal from her was received at 20:45, reporting a submarine sighting.<ref name="Campbell p122"/> During the night of 31 May<U+2013>1 June, the British [[destroyer]] [[HMS Spitfire (1912)|HMS ''Spitfire'']], badly damaged after colliding with the German battleship [[SMS Nassau|''Nassau'']], sighted what appeared to be a German battlecruiser, with two widely-spaced funnels, described as being "...a mass of fire from foremast to mainmast, on deck and between decks. Flames were issuing out of her from every corner."  The mystery ship exploded at about midnight.  It was later thought that the burning ship may have been ''Black Prince'', with the two midships funnels having collapsed or been shot away.<ref name="Fawcett p180-1">Fawcett and Hooper 1921, pp. 180<U+2013>181.</ref> 

Recent historians, however, hold to the German account of the ship's sinking. ''Black Prince'' briefly engaged the German battleship [[SMS Rheinland|''Rheinland'']] at about 23:35 [[GMT]], scoring two hits with 6-inch shells.<ref name="Campbell p286-7">Campbell 1998, pp. 286<U+2013>287.</ref> Separated from the rest of the British fleet, the ''Black Prince'' approached the German lines at approximately midnight. She turned away from the German battleships, but it was too late. The German battleship {{SMS|Th<U+00FC>ringen||2}} fixed the ''Black Prince'' in her searchlights and opened fire. Up to five other German ships, including battleships {{SMS|Nassau||2}}, {{SMS|Ostfriesland||2}}, and {{SMS|Friedrich der Grosse|1911|2}}, joined in the bombardment, with return fire from ''Black Prince'' being ineffective. Most of the German ships were between 750 and 1500 yards of the ''Black Prince'' <ref name="Campbell p290">Campbell 1998, p. 290.</ref> - effectively point blank range for contemporary naval gunnery. ''Black Prince'' was hit by at least twelve heavy shells and several smaller ones,<ref name="Campbell p303">Campbell 1998, p. 303.</ref> sinking within 15 minutes. There were no survivors from ''Black Prince'''s crew, all 857 being killed.<ref name="Campbell p338">Campbell 1998, p. 338.</ref> 

The wreck was briefly surveyed by nautical archaeologist [[Innes McCartney]] in 2000 and 2001. It was discovered that the stern of the wreck is upside-down and bow section lies on its starboard side. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.periscopepublishing.com/images/Jutland%20gallery%20pages/Jutland%20exhibition.htm|title=Jutland Expedition gallery 2001}}</ref> The wrecksite is designated as a ''protected place'' under the [[Protection of Military Remains Act 1986]].<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/uksi_20080950_en_1 SI 2008/950] Designation under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986</ref>
