'''Typhoon Pongsona''' (international designation: '''''0226''''', JTWC designation: '''''31W''''') was the last [[tropical cyclone|typhoon]] of the [[2002 Pacific typhoon season]], and was the costliest disaster in 2002 in the [[United States]].<ref name="femlast">{{cite web|author=Federal Emergency Management Agency|year=2003|title=Super Typhoon Pongsona: The First 100 Days Over $300 Million In Disaster Relief And Assistance|accessdate=2007-07-27|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=2240}}</ref> The name "Pongsona" was contributed by [[North Korea]] and is the [[Korean language|Korean]] name for the [[Impatiens balsamina|garden balsam]].<ref name="Name meaning">{{cite web|author=Gary Padgett|year=2003|date=[[February 24]]|title=Monthly Global Tropical Cyclone Summary|accessdate=2006-08-14|url=http://www.weathermatrix.net/archive/tropical/summaries-2002/0020.html}}</ref> Pongsona developed out of an area of disturbed weather on [[December 2]], and steadily intensified to reach typhoon status on [[December 5]]. On [[December 8]] it passed through Guam and the [[Northern Marianas Islands]] while near its peak 10-min winds of 175&nbsp;km/h (110&nbsp;mph). It ultimately turned to the northeast, weakened, and became extratropical on [[December 11]].

Considered by some to be the worst typhoon to have struck [[Guam]], Pongsona produced strong wind gusts peaking at 278&nbsp;km/h (173&nbsp;mph), which left the entire island without power and destroyed about 1,300&nbsp;houses. With strong building standards and experience from repeated typhoon strikes, there were no fatalities directly related to Pongsona, though there was one indirect death from flying glass. Damage on the island totaled over $700&nbsp;million (2002&nbsp;USD, $800&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD), making Pongsona among the five costliest typhoons on the island. The typhoon also caused heavy damage on [[Rota]] and elsewhere in the [[Northern Marianas Islands]], and as a result of its impact, the name was retired.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Pongsona 2002 track.png}}
In late November, an area of [[convection]] persisted about 625&nbsp;km (390&nbsp;mi) east-southeast of [[Pohnpei]].

Upon first becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression tracked northwestward, and in the hours after being classified the circulation became exposed to the east of the deepest convection. Despite its initial lack of organization, the JTWC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status early on [[December 3]] while it was located about 280&nbsp;km (175&nbsp;mph) south of [[Ujelang Atoll]].<ref name="disc2">{{cite web|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|year=2002|title=Tropical Storm 31W Warning NR 002|accessdate=2007-06-19|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/GuamStuff/2002/Dec/2002120303-WTPN.PGTW}}</ref> Previously, the wind shear exposed the center, though it decreased and allowed the convection to redevelop over the circulation.<ref name="ts31w2">{{cite web|author=Lam|year=2002|title=Tropical Storm 31W|publisher=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|accessdate=2007-06-19|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/GuamStuff/2002/Dec/2002120306-TPPN.PGTW}}</ref> Accordingly, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Pongsona at 1200&nbsp;UTC on [[December 3]] while located 375&nbsp;km (230&nbsp;mi) northeast of Pohnpei.<ref name="jmasum"/> Located to the south of an upper-level [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]], Pongsona turned westward and gradually intensified.<ref name="prog1">{{cite web|author=Wingeart et. al|year=2002|title=Tropical Storm Pongsona Prognostic Reasoning 004|publisher=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|accessdate=2007-06-19|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/GuamStuff/2002/Dec/2002120315-WDPN.PGTW}}</ref> On [[December 5]], the storm developed tightly curved banding features and began forming an [[eye (cyclone)|eyewall]]; as a result both the JTWC<ref name="disc11">{{cite web|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|year=2002|title=Typhoon 31W (Pongsona) Warning NR 011|accessdate=2007-06-19|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/GuamStuff/2002/Dec/2002120509-WTPN.PGTW}}</ref> and the JMA upgraded Pongsona to a typhoon while located 1150&nbsp;km (715&nbsp;mi) southeast of [[Guam]].<ref name="jmasum"/>

===Differences among warning centers===
The [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] uses 10-minute sustained winds, while the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] uses 1-minute sustained winds. The conversion factor between the two is 1.14.<ref name="windchange">{{cite web|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|year=2005|title=Frequently Asked Questions|accessdae=2006-07-23|url=https://metocph.nmci.navy.mil/jtwc/menu/JTFAQ.html}}</ref> JMA's peak intensity for Pongsona was 170&nbsp;km/h (105&nbsp;mph) 10-minute sustained, or 195&nbsp;km/h (120&nbsp;mph) 1-minute sustained. The JTWC's peak intensity for Pongsona was 240&nbsp;km/h (150&nbsp;mph) 1-minute sustained, or 210&nbsp;km/h (130&nbsp;mph) 10-minute sustained. The [[National Meteorological Center of China]] estimated a peak intensity of 185&nbsp;km/h (115&nbsp;mph) 10-minute sustained, or 210&nbsp;km/h (135&nbsp;mph) 1-minute sustained.<ref name="gp">{{cite web|author=Gary Padgett|year=2003|title=Tropical Cyclone Summary for December 2002|accessdate=2006-07-19|url=http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2003/summ0212.txt}}</ref>

==Preparations==
The [[Guam]] [[National Weather Service]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|Tropical Storm Watch]] for the [[Marshall Islands]] shortly after Pongsona developed into a tropical storm, and a day later watches were issued for [[Chuuk]]. On [[December 5]], the service issued tropical storm warnings for all of the [[Federal States of Micronesia]].<ref name="nws">{{cite web|author=John J. Kelly Jr.|year=2003|title=Super Typhoon Pongsona Service Assessment|publisher=United States Departent of Commerce|accessdate=2006-10-07|url=http://www.weather.gov/os/assessments/pdfs/Pongsona.pdf}}</ref> As Pongsona became a typhoon, the Guam National Weather Service issued a Typhoon Watch for [[Guam]], [[Rota]], [[Saipan]], and [[Tinian]], which was upgraded to a Typhoon Warning about 23 hours prior to the onset of typhoon-force winds. Typhoon warnings were also issued for the unpopulated island of [[Agrihan]]. By one day prior to the typhoon moving through the [[Mariana Islands]], local weather offices predicted Pongsona to pass well east of the area. Despite a more westward motion than anticipated, forecasts remained stagnant until the morning of [[December 8]], when two lead forecasters reluctantly predicted much greater threat to the Mariana Islands. As a result, many citizens felt they were unprepared and insufficiently warned for the typhoon.<Ref name="nws"/> 

Nine shelters throughout the Northern Mariana Islands were opened to accommodate families needing assistance. Several schools opened classrooms as evacuation centers, as well.<ref name="saipantribune">{{Cite news|author=Saipan Tribune|year=2002|title=Residents told: Prepare for typhoon|accessdate=2006-10-07|url=http://72.14.235.104/search?q=cache:NNi2agubPP8J:www.saipantribune.com/archives/defaultarch.aspx%3Farchdte%3D12/8/2002%252012:00:00%2520AM+Typhoon+Pongsona+Shelter+-after&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=17&client=firefox-a}}</ref>  On [[Guam]], ten schools were used as shelters,<ref name="kuam">{{cite web|author=Sabina Salas|year=2002|title=Brace for impact:Pongsona to hit Guam and Rota this afternoon|publisher=KUAM|accessdate=2006-10-07|url=http://www.kuam.com/news/4758.aspx}}</ref> and on the day of impact 2,271 people were in shelters. 150 people on [[Rota]] sought shelter, and in [[Saipan]] 549 people were in shelters by the day of impact.<ref name="ncdc">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2003|title=Event Report for Typhoon Pongsona|accessdate=2006-10-10|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~490231}}</ref> The [[Guam Memorial Hospital]] officials advised all pregnant mothers within 32 weeks of their delivery date to check in.

The staff also stationed two reporters elsewhere on the island to provide information for later updates as well as the paper's website.<ref name="pdn">{{cite web|author=FEMA|year=2003|title=When the Media is a Disaster Victim: How one small Paper kept the world informed|accessdate=2006-10-07|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=2295}}</ref>

==Impact==
===Federal States of Micronesia===
Early in its duration, Pongsona first affected [[Pohnpei]] as a tropical storm. There, it produced heavy rains and gusty winds, though little damage was reported. Later, it brought tropical storm force winds to [[Chuuk]]. High waves from the storm washed over and covered some atolls.<ref name="nws"/> 

===Guam===
[[Image:Typhoon Pongsona damage Guam.jpg|thumb|250px|Damage from Pongsona on Guam]]
Typhoon Pongsona maintained a 65&nbsp;km (40&nbsp;mi) wide [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] upon crossing the northern, populated portion of the island of [[Guam]]; the [[Andersen Air Force Base]] was in the eye for two hours. Winds from the typhoon peaked at 232&nbsp;km/h (144&nbsp;mph) with gusts peaking at 278&nbsp;km/h (173&nbsp;mph); gusts of at least 160&nbsp;km/h (100&nbsp;mph) affected the entire island. The lowest pressure on the island was 935&nbsp;[[mbar]] (27.61&nbsp;inHg), making Pongsona the third most intense typhoon to strike Guam; it is behind only a typhoon in 1900 (926 mbar) and [[Typhoon Karen]] of 1962 (932&nbsp;mbar).<ref name="nws"/> 

Strong winds from the typhoon caused communications on the island to fail, resulting in the National Weather Service in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] providing backup support to Guam by temporarily issuing warnings and advisories. The winds also caused many anemometers near the northern coastline to fail.<ref name="nws"/> The winds collapsed several walls at the [[Guam Memorial Hospital]], resulting in major damage throughout the northern two-thirds of the facility and several units being shut down. Several hotels, churches, and schools received moderate damage, and the [[Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport]] received damage to navigation equipment. The winds greatly damaged 715&nbsp;power poles and 513&nbsp;transformers, with about $52&nbsp;million in electrical damage reported (2002&nbsp;USD, $59&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD);<ref name="ncdc"/> the entire island was left without power and phone service.<ref name="femupdate">{{cite web|author=Federal Emergency Management Agency|year=2003|title=Update on Recovery Efforts in Guam and Rota following Super Typhoon Pongsona|accessdate=2007-06-29|url=http://www.nvoad.org/uploads/reports/NVOADnews%20Issue%2037%20%20February%2011,%202003.doc|format=DOC}}</ref> Typhoon Pongsona also left 65% of the island's water wells inoperable,<ref name="ncdc"/> with most of Guam left without water service following the storm.<ref name="femupdate"/> Officials estimate the typhoon destroyed 1,300&nbsp;homes, with an additional 1,825 severely damaged and 4,800 receiving minor damage.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bonnie Gillespie|year=2002|title=Hope Prevails Amid Complex Recovery in Guam|publisher=RedCross.org|accessdate=2007-07-23|url=http://www.redcross.org/news/ds/hurricanes/021215pongsona.html}}</ref>

[[Image:Pongsona Guam damage.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Damage in Guam from typhoon]]
Tracking slowly across the center of the island, the intense inner [[tropical cyclone#Structure|rainbands]] dropped heavy rainfall which peaked at 650&nbsp;mm (25.61&nbsp;in) at the [[University of Guam]].<ref name="nws"/> The precipitation led to record river flow on the [[List of rivers in Guam|Pago and Asan Rivers]]; overflown rivers caused damage to some roads and bridges. The rainfall also caused extensive flooding in several villages. Pongsona produced a [[storm surge]] of up to 6&nbsp;m (20&nbsp;feet) was reported at some locations, with 3&ndash;4&nbsp;m (9&ndash;13&nbsp;ft) recorded near the eyewall. Considerable storm surge flooding occurred from [[Tumon]] southward to [[Piti, Guam|Piti]], leaving some buildings on the west coast of the island flooded with 1&nbsp;m (4&nbsp;ft). The combination of strong storm surge and rough waves caused considerable beach erosion, causing severe coastal damage.<ref name="ncdc"/>

Across Guam, damage totaled over $700&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;[[USD]], $800&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD), placing it among the five costliest typhoons on the island. Pongsona resulted in 193&nbsp;injuries, as reported by the Guam Department of Health; most were lacerations and fractures caused by flying glass and other debris. There was one indirect death attributed to the storm, when a 71-year old woman was cut by flying glass and subsequently suffered a fatal heart attack. Medical help could not reach her due to the intensity of the storm. As the eyes of 6 typhoons had passed over the island in the previous ten years, officials in Guam enacted strong building standards, keeping deaths and injuries to a minimum. The typhoon was considered the worst typhoon to ever strike the island due to the large eye affecting most of the population.<ref name="nws"/>

===Northern Marianas Islands===
[[Image:Typhoon Pongsona - Rota.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Typhoon damage on [[Rota]]]]
Pongsona produced sustained winds of 126&nbsp;km/h (78&nbsp;mph) with a gust to 137&nbsp;km/h (85&nbsp;mph) on [[Rota]]. The combination of winds and other effects from the typhoon destroyed 114&nbsp;houses, severely damaged 154, and caused minor damage to 306; on the island, about 200 families were left homeless. The typhoon produced a [[storm surge]] of 22&nbsp;feet at [[Songsong|Songsong Village]], which crossed about 80% of the southwestern peninsula on Rota. The surge caused moderate beach erosion on the island, and destroyed a fuel pier and a loading pipeline. Additionally, the typhoon caused severe crop damage on the island. In all, the typhoon caused 10 minor injuries on Rota, and resulted in over $30&nbsp;million in damage (2002&nbsp;USD, $34&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD).<ref name="ncdc"/>

On [[Tinian]], the passage of Pongsona caused two destroyed homes, with seven receiving major damage and another eight with minor damage. The winds damaged power lines, causing two island-wide power outages. Major crop damage was reported.<ref name="ncdc"/> 

On [[Saipan]], the typhoon destroyed two houses, with seven receiving major damage and another eight with minor damage. Sustained winds on the island peaked at 71&nbsp;km/h (44&nbsp;mph), which caused scattered power outages. Six minor injuries were reported, and damage totaled about $100,000 (2002&nbsp;USD, $114,000&nbsp;USD 2007&nbsp;USD).<ref name="ncdc"/>

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Pongsona gas tank fire.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Gas tank fire on Cabras Island]]
On the same day of Typhoon Pongsona striking [[Guam]], [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] declared the island a major disaster area.<ref>{{cite web|author=Federal Emergency Management Agency|accessdate=2007-06-29|title=President Declares Major Disaster For Guam Typhoon|year=2002|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=2134}}</ref> Around the time of the cyclone passing over the island, 2,271&nbsp;residents were in shelters.

Nearly 29,000&nbsp;individuals registered for disaster assistance, with the first assistance check arriving ten days after the disaster declaration. By three months after the storm, the United States [[Small Business Administration]] approved $130&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $145&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD) in low-interest loans.<ref name="femlast"/>

During the height of the typhoon at [[Apra Harbor|Cabras Island]] on Guam, a gasoline tank caught fire, believed to be from friction caused by extremely high winds running through its ventilation system. The tank exploded, sending its lid airborne and spreading the fire to other nearby tanks. The proximity of the tanks as well as low water pressure hampered firefighting efforts, and the fire was extinguished five days later; it resulted in three destroyed gasoline tanks with two more caught on fire.<ref name="ncdc"/>

On [[December 11]], [[2002]], President Bush extended the disaster declaration to include the [[Northern Marianas Islands]], which allocated emergency disaster aid for the territory. The declaration provided funding for 75% of the budget for debris removal and emergency protective measures.<ref>{{cite web|author=FEMA|accessdate=2007-07-23|title=President Orders Disaster Aid For Northern Mariana Islands Typhoon Response|year=2002|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=2130}}</ref> Immediately following the typhoon, FEMA assigned various federal agencies to respond to the island of Rota. Officials airlifted about 3,600&nbsp;kg (8,000&nbsp;lbs) of emergency supplies including tents, tarps, water containers, coolers, cooking kits and electrical equipment. Military personnel were transported to assist in recovery efforts. By four months after the typhoon, 749&nbsp;individuals on the island registered through FEMA's teleregistration number. The United States [[Small Business Administration]] approved 147&nbsp;low&ndash;interest loans for $9.1&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $10.2&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD) to individuals and businesses and for economic injury on Rota. In all, disaster aid to Rota totaled $17.4&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $19.4&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD).<ref>{{cite web|author=FEMA|year=2003|title=CNMI Disaster Assistance Tops $17 Million For Typhoon Pongsona|accessdate=2007-07-23|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=2360}}</ref> Additionally, President Bush authorized for disaster assistance for the [[Federated States of Micronesia]].<ref>{{cite web|author=FEMA|year=2003|title=President Declares Major Disaster For Micronesia|accessdate=2007-07-23|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=2125}}</ref>

Due to the damage resulted from the storm, the name '''Pongsona''' was retired during the thirty-eighth session of the [[Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] and [[World Meteorological Organization]] typhoon committee in [[November 2005]]; it was replaced with the name '''Noul'''.<ref>{{cite web|author=ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee|year=2005|title=38th Session of the Typhoon Committee|accessdate=2007-07-27|url=http://www.disaster.go.th/html/ricb/foreign/2006/tc/typhoon38.html}}</ref>
