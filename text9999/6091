'''''Ill Manors''''' (stylised as '''''ill Manors''''') is a soundtrack album by British musician and rapper [[Plan B (musician)|Plan B]] released on 23 July 2012 as the soundtrack to the [[Ill Manors|film of the same name]]. Several songs were used in the film ''Ill Manors'', although some of the recordings were completed after the release of the film. The record was mainly produced by [[Al Shux]] and Plan B and also features collaborations with [[Labrinth]], [[Kano (rapper)|Kano]], [[Takura|Takura Tendayi]] and [[John Cooper Clarke]]. ''Ill Manors'' debuted at number-one on the [[UK Album Charts]] and received positive reviews by critics. The album was nominated for the [[Mercury Prize]].

==Background and composition==
The film ''Ill Manors'' was written as a "[[hip hop]] [[musical film|musical]] for the twenty-first century",<ref name="gigwise.com">{{cite web |url= http://www.gigwise.com/news/55387/Plan-B-To-Direct-Hip-Hop-Musical-Movie---Exclusive |title= Plan B to Direct Hip-Hop Musical Movie |first= Jason |last= Gregory |authorlink= |date=22 March 2010 |work= [[Gigwise.com]]|publisher= |location= |accessdate= }}</ref> incorporating elements of both crime drama and music video sequences. Plan B had always intended to narrate the film with a different song for each the six stories,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/522/plan_b_from_a_to_b |title=Plan B interview by Pete Lewis, 'Blues & Soul' April 2010 |publisher=Bluesandsoul.com |date=|accessdate=9 November 2010}}</ref> however some songs were written later, such as "[[Ill Manors (song)|Ill Manors]]". Due to success of ''[[The Defamation of Strickland Banks]]'', Plan B [[The Defamation of Strickland Banks Tour|toured]] extensively for two years and post-production of the film and the recording of the album was not completed until 2012.

Recording sessions for the album took place at [[The Sanctuary (recording studio)|The Sanctuary]] in London and [http://www.recordingstudiocheshire.co.uk Edge Recording Studio] in [[Alderley Edge]], Cheshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordingstudiocheshire.co.uk/blog/?p=65 |title=Blog &#124; The Edge Recording Studios |publisher=recordingstudiocheshire.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}</ref> Speaking about the album in an interview, Drew stated, "You could call it [[bassline (dance music)|bassline]], [[soul music|soul]], with a bit of [[hip hop]]. The album has the lyrical depth of [[Who Needs Actions When You Got Words|my first record]] but the musical composition is light years ahead, as it's informed by everything I've learnt in the last five years <U+2013> writing, producing and playing with a live band. I feel I'm better than I've ever been."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9B0y9oV7Mk |title=Plan B: 'ill Manors' interview (BBC Radio 1Xtra) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}</ref> In an ''[[NME]]'' magazine interview with Drew on 31 March 2012, "I Am the Narrator", the first song heard in the film, was originally given the working title of "Fairydust". "Deepest Shame" was first written as a hip hop song entitled "Michelle" that was used in Drew's 2008 short film ''Michelle'' and features beatboxer Faith SFX. The version of "Michelle" that was used in ''Ill Manors'' has some elements similar to "Deepest Shame", however for the album release the song was re-written as more of a soul number, although "Michelle" is included on the deluxe edition bonus disc.

"Lost My Way" was first performed live on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]'' in May 2012 and Drew claimed that he was still writing the second verse on the way to the TV studio. Before its performance at Maida Vale, Plan B stated the working title of "Playing with Fire" was "Jake", named after its corresponding character in the film. During an interview via [[Digital Spy]] on 6 June 2012, Drew admitted that he had to yet to complete work on the record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a385559/plan-b-hasnt-finished-ill-manors-soundtrack-video.html |title=Plan B hasn't finished 'iLL Manors' soundtrack - video - Music News |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2012-06-06 |accessdate=2014-02-25}}</ref> After the performance, Drew was interviewed by [[Zane Lowe]], and he admitted that although work was due to be completed on the album on that day, the album was still incomplete. In an NME interview in March 2012, it was stated that a track entitled "Don't Be Afraid", produced by former Plan B collaborators [[Chase & Status]], had been pencilled in as the second single. The final album did not contain any production from Chase & Status. The same interview confirmed a track called "The Towers" had been completed. This did not feature on the album, and it is unclear whether it was re-titled or remains unreleased. "Lost My Way", "Great Day for a Murder" and "Live Once" do not feature in the movie.  "Pity The Plight" contains different lyrics to the movie version, which deals with Chris getting information out of Terry at the garage. The album version deals with the stand-off between Chris, Jake and Marcell.

==Promotion and release==
On 8 February 2012, it was announced the album would be released on 7 May via [[Atlantic Records]]. Shortly after, the album's lead single, ''Ill Manors'', premiered.
