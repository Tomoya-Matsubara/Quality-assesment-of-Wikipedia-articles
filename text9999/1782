The '''Youngstown and Southeastern Railroad''' {{reporting marks|YSRR}} is a [[short-line railroad]] subsidiary of the [[Indiana Boxcar Corporation]] that operates [[freight train]]s between [[Youngstown, Ohio]] and [[Darlington, Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. The line is owned by the [[Columbiana County Port Authority]], leased to the '''Eastern States Railroad''', which is owned by the line's primary shipper, and contracted out to the YSRR. Freight is interchanged with [[CSX Transportation]] and the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] at the Youngstown end. 

The trackage was originally owned by the '''Youngstown and Southern Railway''' {{reporting marks|YS}}, which operated from 1904 to 1993, including a period as an [[electric railway|electric]] [[interurban]] passenger railway between 1907 and 1948, being the last such line in Ohio.<ref name=interurban/> It was later jointly owned by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and [[Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad]]. After a local company bought the line in November 1996 and illegally closed it and blocked repairs,<ref name=stretched/><ref name=STB-20080428/> the line was out of service for almost five years until the '''Central Columbiana and Pennsylvania Railway''' {{reporting mark|CQPA}} began operations in May 2001.<ref name=cargo/> Service under the YSRR name started in 2006, after the second of two less-than-two-year periods of operation by the [[Ohio Central Railroad System]] component '''Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad''' {{reporting mark|OHPA}} (the first was in 1995 and 1996).

==Line description==
The YSRR begins in southern Youngstown, where it interchanges with [[CSX Transportation]] and the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] adjacent to the [[Mahoning River]]. It heads northwest up the river bank and then curves southwest to climb a ravine to the highlands of [[Boardman Township, OH|Boardman Township]].  The original interurban line followed Front Street and South Avenue out of downtown and over the Mahoning River, then a private [[right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] between Wabash and Franklin Avenues, joining the present line just east of South Avenue.<ref>[http://www.railsandtrails.com/Maps/Youngstown/Youngstown1934Switching-150l-s.djvu Railroad Switching District: Youngstown Ohio], January 25, 1934</ref> Beyond Boardman, the line continues through the highlands, crossing the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]'s [[Fort Wayne Line]] at [[Columbiana, OH|Columbiana]].  As it approaches [[Signal, Ohio|Signal]], where it turns east, and the [[Pittsburgh, Lisbon and Western Railroad]] once continued west, it drops into the valley of the Little Bull Creek, which empties into [[Bull Creek (Ohio)|Bull Creek]] before it reaches [[Negley, OH|Negley]]. From that community, the [[Smiths Ferry Branch]] formerly extended south alongside the North Fork and main course of [[Little Beaver Creek]], reaching the [[Ohio River]] at [[Smiths Ferry, Ohio|Smiths Ferry]]. The main line continues east from Negley, up the North Fork Little Beaver Creek valley into Pennsylvania, where it ends at [[Darlington, PA|Darlington]]. It formerly continued a short distance farther to the Fort Wayne Line at [[New Galilee, PA|New Galilee]].<ref name=maps>[[Google Maps]] street maps and [[USGS]] [[topographic map]]s, accessed December 2008 via [http://mapper.acme.com/ ACME Mapper]</ref>

==History==
The Youngstown and Southern Railway (Y&S) and Youngstown and Salem Railroad were both incorporated in May 1903,<ref>[[Ohio Secretary of State]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=44lhAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA811 Annual Report for the Year Ending Nov. 15, 1903], p. 811</ref> and the former absorbed the latter in October of that year.<ref>[[New York Times]], [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9804E7DD1039E333A25755C0A9669D946297D6CF General Business Items], October 6, 1903, p. 12</ref> It began operations in 1904 as a {{convert|16|mi|adj=on}} [[steam railroad|steam line]] between [[Youngstown, OH|Youngstown]] and [[Columbiana, OH|Columbiana]], and [[electric railway|electrified]] the line with [[overhead wires]] in 1907, also extending it {{convert|3|mi}} to [[Leetonia, OH|Leetonia]] on the [[Youngstown and Ohio River Railroad]] (Y&OR) that year. In addition to carrying [[passenger train|passenger]]s as an [[interurban railway]], the company handled [[freight train|freight]], primarily [[coal]] from the electric Y&OR and the steam [[Pittsburgh, Lisbon and Western Railroad]] (PL&W). After the Y&S entered [[receivership]] in 1915, a 1916 reorganization produced the '''Youngstown and Suburban Railway'''.<ref name=interurban>George W. Hilton & John F. Due, The Electric Interurban Railways in America, [[Stanford University Press]], 2000, ISBN 0804740143, p. 270</ref>

In the late 1920s and early 1930s, [[Mahoning Valley]] industries and the [[Pittsburgh Coal Company]] attempted to build a new rail line between the [[Ohio River]] and Youngstown, claiming that the existing railroad connections ([[Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad]] and [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]) refused to build suitable [[ship-to-rail transfer|river transfer]] facilities. The [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] denied the application in exchange for the construction of these facilities. Later the coal company built a [[private railroad]] from the river at [[Smiths Ferry, Pennsylvania]] to the PL&W at [[Negley, Ohio]], where it connected to Youngstown through control, by its [[Montour Railroad]] subsidiary, of the PL&W ([[New Galilee, Pennsylvania]] to [[Lisbon, Ohio]]) and Y&S (the latter acquired in 1928<ref name=interurban/>), and construction of a line<!--by which company?--> between the PL&W at [[Signal, Ohio|Signal]] and the Y&S at Columbiana. (The PL&W from Signal west to Lisbon was subsequently abandoned.<!--when?-->) Large amounts of coal were shipped along the river from the mines to Smiths Ferry, and then over the rail line to Youngstown [[steel mill]]s.<ref name=P&LE>Harold H. McLean, Pittsburgh and Lake Erie R.R., [[Golden West Books]], 1980, ISBN 0870950800, pp. 92-94</ref><ref name=PRR>[[Pennsylvania Railroad]] Board of Directors, [http://www.railsandtrails.com/PRR/BOD1948/index.htm Inspection of Physical Property], November 1948, [http://www.railsandtrails.com/Maps/PRR-Pittsburgh/default.htm pp. 122-128]</ref> The Y&S changed its name back to Youngstown and Southern Railway in 1944,<ref name=interurban/> and on January 1, 1945 it merged the PL&W into itself.<ref name=shortline/>

After [[World War II]], the [[Consolidated Coal Company]], successor to the Pittsburgh Coal Company, decided to sell its railroad properties to the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). The PRR agreed to purchase the Montour, and with it the Y&S, jointly with the [[Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad]] (P&LE), a subsidiary of the [[New York Central Railroad]] (NYC). The two companies gained control on December 31, 1946, and simultaneously conveyed the private railroad south of Negley to the Y&S.<ref name=P&LE/><ref name=PRR/> Passenger service ended in 1948 on the Y&S, the last of Ohio's interurbans, and the Columbiana-Leetonia segment was abandoned that year, its connection to the Y&OR being long-gone. The eastern end of the old PL&W, from [[Darlington, PA|Darlington]] to [[New Galilee, PA|New Galilee]], was also abandoned then.<ref>[[Interstate Commerce Commission]], Finance Docket No. 16126, 1948 (abandonment of Darlington-New Galilee and Columbiana-Leetonia)</ref> By 1960 the Y&S had completely [[diesel locomotive|dieselized]].<ref name=interurban/> After the [[Penn Central Transportation Company]] (successor to the NYC and PRR) declared bankruptcy in 1970, the newly-independent profitable P&LE acquired full control of the Montour, and with it the Y&S.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

The P&LE's finances declined with those of the [[steel industry]] in the 1980s, and [[CSX Transportation]] acquired its main lines in 1991 and 1992.<ref>[[Kalmbach Publishing]], [http://www.trains.com/ctr/default.aspx?c=a&id=61 Fallen Flags: P-S], accessed December 2008</ref> The newly-created '''PL&W Railroad''' {{reporting mark|PLW}} began operating the Y&S under lease on May 1, 1993, and transferred the lease to the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad (O&P), a part of the [[Ohio Central Railroad System]], on June 14, 1995.<ref name=shortline>Edward A. Lewis, [[Kalmbach Publishing]], American Short Line Railway Guide, 5th Edition, 1996, p. 233</ref> The Negley-Smiths Ferry line was abandoned in 1996<!--apparently the PL&W owned it directly?-->, having gone at least two years without seeing a train,<ref>STB Docket No. AB-476 (Sub-No. 1X), August 5, 1996</ref> leaving only Youngstown-Darlington for the O&P to operate. The P&LE filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy on March 22, 1996.<ref>[[Railroad Retirement Board]], [http://www.rrb.gov/blaw/bcd/bcd03-80.htm Employer Status Determination: Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Properties, Inc.], October 29, 2003</ref> When the O&P declined to purchase the leased trackage from the Y&S, the owner sold it to '''Railroad Ventures, Inc.''' (RVI) on November 8. RVI immediately, illegally,<ref name=STB-20080428/> canceled the lease, forcing the O&P to issue an embargo, a process intended for a temporary cessation of service. After shippers complained,<ref name=STB-20080428>[http://www.stb.dot.gov/Decisions/readingroom.nsf/WEBUNID/F7EC9B7DD1FB05C2852574360054AD13?OpenDocument STB Docket No. AB-556 (Sub-No. 2X)], April 28, 2008</ref> the federal [[Surface Transportation Board]] (STB) investigated, and the O&P and RVI negotiated a new lease agreement in early December. But only two weeks later, the line was washed out by flooding, and the O&P issued a second embargo on December 18.<ref>[http://www.stb.dot.gov/decisions/ReadingRoom.nsf/WEBUNID/948DFECBF58A478F8525654100705E23?OpenDocument STB Finance Docket No. 33385 and Docket No. 41991], July 15, 1997</ref>

RVI belatedly filed with the STB for authorization to purchase the line in January 1997, but it was rejected because RVI did not acknowledge its [[common carrier obligation]] and the [[Columbiana County Port Authority]] (CCPA) alleged that RVI would not provide that service. A second filing in April was approved after RVI agreed to operate the line. RVI did not allow the CCPA to repair the line or carry out any repairs itself, instead filing for abandonment in January 1999 and again in May. CCPA submitted an offer of financial assistance to buy the line in September, and asked the STB to establish its value. The STB penalized RVI for its "blatant disregard of its common carrier obligation to provide service", including several sales and agreements it had made and kept secret. Only 20 days after purchasing the line in 1996, RVI had sold the "debris"<ref name=STB-20080428/> ([[rail tracks|rail]], [[rail tie|tie]]s, and [[track ballast|ballast]]) to a [[scrap dealer]]. Later, in October 1999, RVI transferred [[subsurface rights|subsurface]] and [[air rights]] to an affiliate, Venture Properties of Boardman, Inc. A November 1999 contract with [[Boardman Township, Ohio|Boardman Township]] required RVI's successor to pay for [[grade separation]]s, and that month RVI sold a portion of the right-of-way to the Boardman Township Park District. During its ownership of the line, RVI had also allowed it to be paved over at [[grade crossing]]s and for access to a [[shopping center]] partly owned by its [[CEO]]. The STB voided RVI's transfers, contracts, and agreements, and ordered RVI to sell the entire railroad property and pay for the necessary repairs.<ref name=stretched>Frank N. Wilner, [[Traffic World]], [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5780687_ITM Stretched Too Thin], July 10, 2000</ref><ref name=STB-20080428/><ref name=STB-20001003>[http://www.stb.dot.gov/Decisions/readingroom.nsf/WEBUNID/E29E69FE6D97A56F85256961006E7667?OpenDocument STB Docket No. AB-556 (Sub-No. 2X) and Finance Docket No. 33385], October 4, 2000</ref> This too proved problematic, when RVI interfered with the [[escrow fund]] set up for this purpose, and the STB ordered the money transferred directly to the CCPA in November 2001.<ref name=STB-20080428/>

CCPA acquired the line from RVI on January 24, 2001,<ref>[http://www.stb.dot.gov/Decisions/readingroom.nsf/WEBUNID/A2C3AE0C2C1EF17E85256F690064D55F?OpenDocumentSTB Docket No. AB-556 (Sub-No. 2X)], December 13, 2004</ref> and the new Central Columbiana and Pennsylvania Railway, a subsidiary of [[Arkansas Short Line Railroads, Inc.]],<ref>[http://www.stb.dot.gov/decisions/ReadingRoom.nsf/WEBUNID/CE7C1B0E9B7AD64685256849005E0DC8?OpenDocument STB Finance Docket No. 33817], December 23, 1999</ref> began operations between Youngstown and Boardman Supply in [[Boardman Township, Ohio|Boardman Township]] on May 31.<ref name=cargo>[[Business Journal]], CC&PA Railroad Makes Cargo Delivery Tomorrow, May 30, 2001</ref> On August 31, the entire line was reopened when a CQPA train reached the end in [[Darlington, PA|Darlington]].<ref>[[Railpace Newsmagazine]], Lake Shore Shorts, October 2001, p. 33</ref> Although it had increased its business to serve 9 customers, the CQPA, and its parent Arkansas Short Line Railroads, suffered from cash flow problems, which limited its ability to make repairs to handle the increased traffic, and it filed for bankruptcy in June 2004.<ref>Tom Giambroni, [[Lisbon Morning Journal]], Four Companies Interested in Rail Operation, June 22, 2004</ref><ref>[[East Liverpool Review]], June 22, 2004</ref> The Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad resumed temporary operations in December 2004,<ref>[http://www.stb.dot.gov/decisions/ReadingRoom.nsf/WEBUNID/84928C98CEB4407785256F6B00646919?OpenDocument STB Finance Docket No. 34632], December 21, 2004</ref> but decided not to continue the lease upon the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings.

In 2000, when the [[Railroad Retirement Board]] (RRB) reconsidered its determination that RVI was an employer under the [[Railroad Retirement Act]] and [[Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act]], it created a three-part test for deciding whether a non-operating lessor, which still retains the residual common-carrier obligation if the lessee ceases operations, is a covered employer. For the company to pass this "Railroad Ventures test", and therefore not be covered, the following must all be true:
#The primary business purpose of the company is not to profit from railroad activities.
#The company does not operate its line or retain that capacity.
#The operator of the line is or would be a covered employer.
Since RVI's primary purpose was to profit from selling off the line, it failed the test.<ref>[[Railroad Retirement Board]], [http://www.rrb.gov/pdf/bcd/bcd00-47.pdf Employer Status Determination: Railroad Ventures, Inc., Decision on Reconsideration], November 7, 2000</ref> This was a departure from earlier decisions, which had cited a 1989 determination that the [[Board of Trustees of the Galveston Wharves]] was not a covered employer to declare any such non-operating company not covered.<ref>[[Railroad Retirement Board]], [http://www.rrb.gov/pdf/bcd/bcd98-48.pdf Employer Status Determination: Railroad Ventures, Inc.], 1998</ref> The test has been applied to declare, for example, the Eastern States Railroad not covered (since it was created to preserve service rather than to profit)<ref>[[Railroad Retirement Board]], [http://www.rrb.gov/blaw/bcd/bcd08-14.asp Employer Status Determination: Eastern States Railroad, LLC], March 13, 2008</ref> and [[Pennsylvania Lines, LLC]] covered (since it was wholly owned by [[Conrail]], a for-profit carrier, and thus presumed to be for-profit).<ref>[[Railroad Retirement Board]], [http://www.rrb.gov/blaw/bcd/bcd01-30.html Employer Status Determination: Pennsylvania Lines, LLC], March 28, 2001</ref>
