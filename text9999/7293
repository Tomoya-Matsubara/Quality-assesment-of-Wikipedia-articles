'''''Sammy Going South''''', retitled '''A Boy Ten Feet Tall''' for its later US release, is a 1963 British [[adventure film]] directed by [[Alexander Mackendrick]], photographed by [[Erwin Hillier]], and starring [[Edward G. Robinson]], [[Fergus McClelland]] and [[Constance Cummings]].<ref>http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/49323</ref> 

Ten-year-old Sammy ([[Fergus McClelland]]) lives in [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]], with his parents. When they are killed in a bombing during the [[Suez Crisis]], the boy flees the city in the ensuing panic. He sets out to reach his only living relative, an aunt who lives 5000 miles to the south in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]]--on the other side of the continent and in a different hemisphere. Along his journey Sammy encounters a colorful array of characters. His first "guide" is an Arab peddler who dies in a freak accident. Sammy is then "rescued" by wealthy tourist Gloria van Imhoff ([[Constance Cummings]]). When she wants to return him to [[Port Said]], Sammy runs off and encounters a crusty old hunter/diamond smuggler, Cocky Wainwright ([[Edward G. Robinson]]), whose life is subsequently saved by the boy. When the police search for Sammy, they arrest the old man, who has been a fugitive for years. After Sammy is finally united with his Aunt Jane ([[Zena Walker]]), he learns that the old smuggler left him his entire fortune. As Cocky Wainwright, [[Edward G. Robinson]] gave "one of the subtlest performances of his later career."<ref>Julian Upton, Movimail Catalogue, July 2010, p.13</ref> Chosen for 1963's [[Royal Film Performance]].<ref>Moviemail Film Catalogue, July 2010</ref> and nominated for a [[BAFTA Film Award]] for best British cinematography in [[1964]], the film had a difficult production period; Robinson suffered a heart attack and cast members were bitten by snakes.<ref>Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/444128/index.html "Sammy Going South (1963)"], BFI screenonline</ref>
