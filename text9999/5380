'''Cecil Howard Palmer''' ([[14 July]] [[1873]] - [[26 July]] [[1915]]) was an [[England|English]] [[cricketer]] who played nine [[first-class cricket|first-class]] matches around the turn of the 20th century: eight for [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] and one for [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]]. Unusually, he played for two counties in the same season: Worcestershire appearance came against [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]] in 1904, in which year he later played three [[County Championship]] matches for Hampshire. In the game against Oxford he made his highest score, 75 [[not out]].

Palmer made his debut for Hampshire against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] at [[County Ground, Hove|Hove]] in July 1899, scoring 16 and 1. In his other appearance that summer, against [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] at [[Park Avenue Cricket Ground|Bradford]], he made 64, the first of his two half-centuries. He then did not play again until 1901, when in four innings he totalled just eight runs, and after that there was another gap until the above-mentioned 1904 season. After that year, he was to play just one more game, against [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] in July 1907.

As a soldier, Palmer was [[mentioned in despatches]] in the [[Second Boer War]]. In the [[First World War]] he was in the [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment|9th Royal Warwickshire Regiment]], reaching the rank of [[lieutenant-colonel]]. He was killed in action at the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], aged 42.<ref>Obituary. ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' 1916.</ref>
