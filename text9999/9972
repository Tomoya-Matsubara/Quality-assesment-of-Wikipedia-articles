'''Kochi''' ({{Audio|Kochi.ogg|pronunciation}}; [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]]: {{unicode|<U+0D15><U+0D4A><U+0D1A><U+0D4D><U+0D1A><U+0D3F>}} [{{IPA|ko<U+02C8><U+02A7><U+02D0>i}}]); formerly known as '''Cochin''') is a city in the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Kerala]]. The city is one of the principal [[seaport]]s of the country and is located in the district of [[Ernakulam district|Ernakulam]], about 220&nbsp;[[kilometre]]s (140&nbsp;[[Mile|mi]]) north of the state capital, [[Thiruvananthapuram]]. It has an estimated population of 600,000, with an [[Kochi urban agglomeration|extended metropolitan]] population of about 1.5&nbsp;million, making it the largest [[urban agglomeration]] and the largest city in Kerala after the capital.

Since 1102 CE, Kochi was the seat of the [[Kingdom of Cochin]], a [[princely state]] which traces its lineage to the [[Kulasekhara]] empire. Heralded as the ''Queen of the [[Arabian Sea]]'', Kochi was an important [[spice]] trading centre on the Arabian Sea coast from the 14th century onwards. Ancient travellers and tradesmen referred to Kochi in their writings, variously alluding to it as ''Cocym'', ''Cochym'', ''Cochin'', and ''Cochi''. Occupied by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in 1503, Kochi was the site of the first [[European colonies in India|European colonial settlement]] in India. It remained the capital of [[Portuguese India]] until 1530, when [[Goa]] became the capital. The city was later occupied by the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], the [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] and the [[British Empire|British]]. Kochi was the first princely state to willingly join the [[Indian Union]], when India gained [[Indian Independence movement|independence]] in 1947.

Kochi experienced decades of [[economic stagnation]] from independence until 2003, when it entered a period of [[economy of India|economic growth]], leading to a spurt in the city's development. A growing centre of [[information technology]], [[tourism in India|tourism]] and [[international trade]], Kochi is the commercial hub of Kerala, and one of the fastest growing [[Status of Indian cities|second-tier metros]] in India. Like other large cities in the developing world, Kochi continues to struggle with [[urbanisation]] problems such as [[traffic congestion]] and [[environmental degradation]].

Successive waves of [[human migration|migration]] over the course of several millennia have made Kochi a cultural [[melting pot]]. Despite the risk of [[overdevelopment]], the city retains its distinct colonial heritage and a blend of tradition and modernity.

</ref> One suggests that the city's modern name is derived from the [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] word ''koch azhi'', meaning 'small [[lagoon]]'. Another version mentions the name as derivative of the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] word ''Go shree'' which means 'prosperous with cows'. Certain ancient texts refer to the city ''Balapuri'' (Sanskrit for 'small town'), which became Cochin in course of time.<ref name="Background culture">

According to some accounts, traders from the court of the [[Emperor of China|Chinese ruler]] [[Khubilai Khan]] gave Cochin the name of their homeland. Yet another theory is that Kochi is derived from the word ''Kaci'' meaning 'harbour'. Certain scholars claim that Cochin is derived from the term ''Cocha'', which is a transfiguration of the [[Bible|Biblical]] term ''[[Cohen]]''.<ref name="Corporation of Kochi"/> Accounts by [[Italian people|Italian]] explorers [[Niccol<U+00F2> Da Conti|Nicolo Conti]] (15th century), and [[Fra Paoline]] in the 17th century say that it was called ''Kochchi'', named after the river connecting the [[backwaters]] to the sea. 

After the arrival of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], and later the British, the name '''Cochin''' stuck as the official appellation. The city [[Indian renaming controversy|reverted]] to a closer [[anglicisation]] of its original Malayalam name, '''Kochi''', in 1996. However, it is still widely referred to as Cochin.

</ref> The King of Kochi had authority over the region encompassing the present city of Kochi and adjoining areas. The reign was hereditary, and the family that ruled over Kochi was known as the [[Cochin Royal Family]] (''Perumpadappu Swaroopam'' in the local vernacular). The mainland Kochi remained the capital of the princely state since the 18th century. However, during much of this time, the kingdom was under foreign rule, and the King often only had titular privileges.

[[Fort Kochi]] in Kochi was the first European colonial settlement in India. From 1503 to 1663, Fort Kochi was ruled by [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]].

</ref> The Portuguese rule was followed by that of the Dutch, who had allied with the [[Zamorin]]s in order to conquer Kochi. By 1773, the Mysore King [[Hyder Ali]] extended his conquest in the [[Malabar region]] to Kochi forcing it to become a tributary of Mysore. The hereditary Prime Ministership of Kochi held by the [[Paliath Achan]]s came to an end during this period. 

Meanwhile, the Dutch, fearing an outbreak of war on the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] signed a [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814|treaty]] with the United Kingdom, under which Kochi was ceded to the United Kingdom in exchange for the island of [[Bangka Island|Bangka]]. However, there are evidences of English habitation in the region even prior to the signing of the treaty.<ref name="charitram">

In 1866, Fort Kochi became a [[municipality]], and its first Municipal Council election was conducted in 1883. The [[Maharaja]] of Cochin, who ruled under the British, in 1896 initiated local administration by forming town councils in [[Mattancherry]] and [[Ernakulam]]. In 1925, Kochi legislative assembly was constituted due to public pressure on the state. 
[[Image:Mattancherry palace bhagvathy kshetram.JPG|200px|thumb|The [[mandir|temple]] adjoining the [[Mattancherry Palace]]]]
Towards the early 20th century, trade at the port had increased substantially, and the need to develop the port was greatly felt. Harbour engineer [[Robert Bristow]] was brought to Kochi in 1920 under the direction of [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon|Lord Willingdon]], then the Governor of [[Madras Presidency|Madras]]. In a span of 21 years, he transformed Kochi as one of the safest harbours in the peninsula, where ships berthed alongside the newly reclaimed inner harbour equipped with a long array of steam cranes.<ref name="ekm-safe">

In 1949, [[Travancore-Cochin]] state came into being with the merger of Cochin and [[Travancore]]. The King of Travancore was the [[Rajpramukh]] of the Travancore-Cochin Union from 1949 to 1956. Travancore-Cochin, was in turn merged with the [[Malabar district]] of the Madras State. Finally, the [[Government of India]]'s [[States Reorganisation Act]] (1956) inaugurated a new state &mdash; Kerala &mdash; incorporating Travancore-Cochin (excluding the four southern Taluks which were merged with [[Tamil Nadu]]), Malabar District, and the [[tehsil|taluk]] of [[Kasargod]], [[South Kanara]].<ref name="lonelyplanet">

</ref> On [[9 July]] [[1960]], the Mattancherry council passed a resolution&mdash;which was forwarded to the government&mdash;requesting the formation of a [[municipal corporation]] by combining the existing municipalities of Fort Kochi, Mattancherry, and Ernakulam. The government appointed a commission to study the feasibility of the suggested merger. Based on its report, the [[Kerala Legislative Assembly]] approved the corporation's formation. On [[1 November]] [[1967]], exactly eleven years since the establishment of the state of Kerala, the [[corporation of Cochin]] came into existence. The merger leading to the establishment of the corporation, was between the municipalities of Ernakulam, Mattancherry and Fort Kochi, along with that of the [[Willingdon Island]], four [[panchayat]]s ([[Palluruthy]], [[Vennala]], [[Vyttila]] and [[Edappally]]), and the small islands of [[Gundu Island|Gundu]] and [[Ramanthuruth]].

Kochi witnessed economic stagnation in the years following India's independence. The city's economic recovery gathered momentum after [[economic reforms in India]] introduced by the [[Government of India|central government]] in the mid-1990s. Since 2000, the [[Tertiary sector of industry|service sector]] has revitalised the city<U+2019>s stagnant economy.

Kochi is located on the southwest coast of India at {{coor dm|9|58|N|76|13|E|}}, spanning an area of 94.88&nbsp;;[[square kilometre]]s (36.63&nbsp;[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]). The city is situated at the northern end of a peninsula, about 19&nbsp;kilometres (12&nbsp;[[Mile|mi]]) long and less than one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) wide. To the west lies the Arabian Sea, and to the east are [[estuary|estuaries]] drained by perennial rivers originating in the [[Western Ghats]]. Much of Kochi lies at sea level, with a coastline of  48&nbsp;km.<ref name="Corporation of Kochi2">

The current metropolitan limits of Kochi include the mainland [[Ernakulam]], old Kochi, the suburbs of [[Edapally]], [[Kalamassery]] and [[Kakkanad]] to the northeast; [[Tripunithura]] to the south east; and a group of islands closely scattered in the [[Vembanad Lake]]. Most of these islands are very small, varying in extent from six square kilometre to less than a square kilometre (1,500 to less than 250&nbsp;[[acre]]s). 

Soil consists of [[sediment]]s such as [[alluvium]], teri's, brown [[sand]]s etc. Hydromorphic [[saline]] soils are also found in the areas surrounding the backwaters.<ref name="Corporation geo">

Exports and allied activities are also important contributors to the city's economy. Kochi's historical reliance on trade continues into modern times, as the city is a major exporter of spices and is home to the [[International Pepper Exchange]], where [[black pepper]] is globally traded. The [[Spices Board of India]] is also headquartered in Kochi. 

Kochi also has an [[oil refinery]]&mdash;the [[Kochi Refineries Limited]] (KRL) at [[Ambalamugal]]. Central Government establishments like the [[Coconut Development Board]], the [[Coir Board of India|Coir Board]] and the [[Marine Products Export Development Authority]] (MPEDA) have head offices located in the city.

==Transport==
{{main|Transport in Kochi}}

Public transport in the city is largely dependent on [[private company|private]] buses. [[Taxicab|Taxi]]s and [[autorickshaw]]s (called ''autos'') are available for hire throughout the day. Narrow roads and the mix of vastly differing types of vehicles have made traffic congestion a major problem in the city. A [[Rapid transit|metro]] rapid transit service, intended to considerably ease congestion, is planned for the city.<ref name="Metro rail: 12 companies come up with proposals">

It also operates passenger ships to [[Colombo]] and Lakshadweep. Boat services operated by [[Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation]], the [[Kerala State Water Transport Department|State Water Transport Department]], and of private ownership are available from various [[jetty|boat jetties]] in the city. The ''junkar'' [[ferry]] for the transshipment of vehicles and passengers between the islands are operated between Ernakulam and [[Vypin]], and between Vypin and Fort Kochi. However, with the construction of the [[Goshree bridges]] (which links Kochi's islands), ferry transport has become less essential.

The [[Cochin International Airport]], which is about 25&nbsp;kilometres (15&nbsp;mi) north of the city, handles both domestic and international flights. It is the largest airport of Kerala, and one of the busiest in India. It is the first international airport in India to be built without Central Government funds.<ref name="Cochin International Airport">

There are two main railway stations&mdash;the [[Ernakulam Junction]] and the [[Ernakulam Town]] (locally known as the 'South' and 'North' railway stations respectively). The railway line connecting these two stations cuts the city longitudinally in two, with two narrow bridges connecting the two halves.
