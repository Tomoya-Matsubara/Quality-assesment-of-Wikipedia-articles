"'''Ultraviolet (Light My Way)'''"<ref>Some publications have spelled the song as "Ultra Violet (Light My Way)". The back cover of the album shows it as two words "ULTRA violet" in the mixed-case style of the track listing, but the inside package material has it as one word.</ref> is a song by the [[rock music|rock]] band [[U2]] and the tenth track from their 1991 album ''[[Achtung Baby]]''.  Ostensibly about love and dependency, the song also lends itself to religious interpretations, with listeners finding allusions to the [[Book of Job]] and writers finding spiritual meaning in its invocation of the [[light spectrum]].

The song's composition and recording incorporate both serious and throwaway elements, in keeping with the rest of ''Achtung Baby''.  While not released as a single, the song has appeared in two films and a U2 business venture was named after it.  "Ultraviolet" played a featured role during the encores of the group's 1992<U+2013>1993 [[Zoo TV Tour|Zoo TV]] and 2009 [[U2 360<U+00B0> Tour|360<U+00B0> Tours]].

==Recording==
"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" began as two different [[demo (music)|demo]]s, one variously called "Ultraviolet" and "69" (which eventually evolved into the B-side "[[Lady with the Spinning Head]]")<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Zoo TV Station Talent |magazine=Propaganda | issue = 16 |date=1992-06-01}}</ref> and an alternately arranged demo called "Light My Way".<ref name="stokes">{{cite book |title=U2: Into the Heart: The stories behind every song |first=Niall |last=Stokes |authorlink=Niall Stokes |edition=3rd |publisher=[[Thunder's Mouth Press]] |year=2005 |isbn=1560257652 |pages=102, 106}}</ref> "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" may have been the accidental inspiration for the origin of the band's hit single "[[One (U2 song)|One]]". Trying to write the bridge to a song (which conflicting reports state was "Ultraviolet", "[[Mysterious Ways (song)|Mysterious Ways]]", and "[[The Fly (U2 song)|The Fly]]"), guitarist [[The Edge]] improvised a riff that the rest of the band rallied around. It was out of this that "One", which changed the outlook of recording sessions for the album, was born.<ref>Flanagan (1995), pp. 10<U+2013>11</ref>

Over the course of the recording sessions, U2 added various [[overdubs]] to the song, but [[record producer|producer]] [[Brian Eno]] believed these additions negatively impacted the track. Eno aided the group in editing down the song, and he explained his assistance as such: "I'd go in and say, 'The song has gone, whatever it is you liked about this song is not there anymore. Sometimes, for example, the song would have disappeared under layers of overdubs."<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Eno |magazine=Propaganda | issue = 16 |date=1992-06-01}}</ref>

==Lyrics and interpretation==
The lyrics of "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" are addressed to a lover, and imply that their relationship is threatened by some sort of personal or spiritual crisis, coupled with a sense of unease over obligations.<ref name="grah-boer">{{cite book |last=Graham |first=Bill |coauthors=van Oosten de Boer |title=U2: The Complete Guide to their Music |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |year=2004 |location=London |isbn=0-7119-9886-8 |page=50}}</ref><ref name="flanagan-22"/>  Indeed, lead vocalist [[Bono]] has called the song "a little disturbed".<ref name="u2byu2"/>  The song opens with 45 seconds of soft synthesizers producing an ethereal sighing, crying, almost breathing sound, somewhat akin in atmospherics to the group's early 1980s songs "Tomorrow" and "Drowning Man"; during this, Bono laments that "sometimes I feel like checking out."<ref name="scharen"/><ref name="beeaff-39">Beeaff (2000), p. 39</ref> This is followed by the entrance of drums and guitar in a familiar U2 rhythm, as Bono describes the burdens of love and how he is "in the black; can't see or be seen."<ref name="scharen"/> Each verse culminates with the refrain "Baby, baby, baby, light my way." [[Flood (producer)|Flood]], who [[audio engineering|engineer]]ed and [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]]ed the recording,<ref name="album">{{cite album-notes |title=Achtung Baby | albumlink=Achtung Baby | bandname=[[U2]] |year=1991 |publisher=[[Island Records]] |format=CD booklet}}</ref> noted that there was considerable laughter and debate during the sessions about whether Bono could get away with singing the repeated "baby"s, one of the most heavily-used clich<U+00E9>s in pop songs and one that he had avoided up to that point in his songwriting; Flood later commented that "he got away with it alright."<ref name="cogan">{{cite book |title=U2: An Irish Phenomenon |first=Vi<U+0161>nja |last=Cogan |publisher=Pegasus Books |year=2008 |isbn=1933648716 |page=66}}</ref>

Although the song is ostensibly about love and dependency, like many U2 songs, it also lends itself to religious interpretations. Listeners have heard an allusion to the [[Book of Job]] [[s:Bible (King James)/Job#Chapter 29|29:2<U+2013>3]] and its tale of God serving as a lamp upon Job's head walking through the darkness.<ref name="scharen"/>  Robyn Brothers suggests that [[ultraviolet light]] is "a metaphor for a divine force both unseen to the naked eye and ultimately unknowable to the human intellect."<ref name="brothers">{{cite book |title=Reading Rock and Roll: Authenticity, Appropriation, Aesthetics | editor-first=Kevin J.

"Ultraviolet" is also one of several songs Bono has written on the theme of woman as spirit, and it echoes the band's 1980 song "Shadows and Tall Trees" by juxtaposing love with the image of ceilings.<ref>{{cite book |title=Call Me the Seeker: Listening to Religion in Popular Music |first=Michael J. |last=Gilmour |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]] |year=2005 |isbn=0826417132 |pages=66, 76}}</ref>  A line in [[Raymond Carver]]'s late 1980s poem "Suspenders", about the quiet that comes into a house where no one can sleep, was subconsciously recycled by Bono into the lyric.<ref name="u2byu2"/><ref>Flanagan (1995), p. 346</ref>  In ''Achtung Baby''{{'}}s running order, "Ultraviolet" serves, with the other two songs at the album's end, "[[Acrobat (song)|Acrobat]]" and "[[Love Is Blindness]]", to explore how couples face the task of reconciling the suffering they have imposed on each other.<ref name="flanagan-22">Flanagan (1995), p. 22</ref>

The song features a [[Motown sound]]-style "telegraph key" rhythm, which gave it the feeling of a pop song.<ref name="stokes"/><ref name="u2byu2"/> This and the "baby, baby" refrain gave the song a throwaway quality that fit in with ''Achtung Baby''{{'}}s mission of deconstructing U2's image.<ref name="stokes"/> Paradoxically, the arrangement also featured U2's 1980s "repeato-riff" guitar style and the rest of the lyric was a serious love song that dealt with themes of anxiety and despair.<ref name="stokes"/><ref name="grah-boer"/>  Bono has described "Ultraviolet" as "an epic U2 song [but] the key of it left my voice in a conversational place and allowed a different kind of lyric writing."<ref name="u2byu2">{{cite book | author = [[U2]] | editor1-first = Neil | editor1-last = McCormick | title = U2 by U2 | publisher = [[HarperCollins Publisher]] | location = London | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-00-719668-7 | page = 228}}</ref>  Producer Eno wrote that a combination of opposites within each song was a signature characteristic of ''Achtung Baby'' and that as part of that, "Ultraviolet" had a "helicopterish melancholy".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/26268220/bringing_up_baby/ |title=Bringing Up Baby |first=Brian |last=Eno |authorlink=Brian Eno |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=1991-11-28}}</ref>  In ''Achtung Baby''{{'}}s album package, "Ultraviolet" is presented next to a photograph of a crumbling [[Berlin]] building that has a [[Trabant]] parked in front of it.<ref name="album"/>

==Reception==
''[[Rolling Stone]]'' noted that "Ultraviolet" was one of the album's songs that hearkened more to the group's past than their new sound, saying that Edge's "soaring peals on [it] are instantly recognizable."<ref>{{cite news |title=U2: Achtung, Baby: Music Reviews |last=Gardner |first=Elysa |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/u2/albums/album/116432/review/5941852/achtung_baby |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=1992-01-09}}</ref> [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that compared to much of the album's grim depictions of personal relations, "Ultraviolet" depicts love as a haven.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/17/arts/recordings-view-u2-takes-a-turn-from-the-universal-to-the-domestic.html?scp=2 |title=U2 Takes a Turn From the Universal To the Domestic |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Jon |last=Pareles |authorlink=Jon Pareles |date=1991-11-17}}</ref> ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' heard echoes of [[The Rolling Stones]]' 1966 song "[[Out of Time (The Rolling Stones song)|Out of Time]]" in the chorus of "Ultraviolet".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/packages/U2Fleetcenter/album_review_achtung_baby |title=U2 bounces back |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |first=Steve |last=Morse |date=1991-11-15}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called it the album's highlight, "where Bono's soaring voice and the Edge's pointillistic guitar meld to create one of those uplifting moments we listen to U2 for".<ref name="ew">{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316330,00.html |title=Achtung Baby: music review |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=Bill |last=Wyman |date=1991-11-19}}</ref>  [[Cedarville University]] literature professor Scott Calhoun says of one lyrical portion of "Ultraviolet", "That's so evocative and works as beautiful writing away from the music.

Other writers have been less enthusiastic.  ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine felt that the song was weak and that "Bono falls back on his old habit of trying to be 'inspirational' by banging up the heat from simmer to meltdown between the verse and chorus."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timepieces.nl/Albums-U/U2_Achtung_Baby.htm |title=U2 - Achtung Baby |work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |accessdate=2009-11-15 |last=Snow |first=Mat}}</ref> U2 chroniclers Bill Graham and Caroline van Oosten de Boer also see the song as a throwback to the group's earlier sound, but say that "the band doesn't sufficiently develop the initial idea to warrant the five minutes of 'Ultra Violet'".<ref name="grah-boer"/>

While "Ultraviolet" was not released as a single, it has appeared in other contexts. It was used in a scene in the 2006 [[Adam Sandler]] film ''[[Click (film)|Click]]'', and was featured in the 2007 film ''[[The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (film)|The Diving Bell and the Butterfly]]''.

"Ultraviolet" is unusual in that the band has only ever played it in concert as part of an encore, usually preceding "[[With or Without You]]". It was first performed at [[Lakeland Arena]] in [[Lakeland, Florida]] on 29 February 1992 at the start of the [[Zoo TV Tour]], and it remained a staple of the band's set lists for the first four legs of the tour, often preceded by a prank call by Bono as his alter-egos Mirror Ball Man or Mr. MacPhisto.<ref name="u2gigs">{{cite web |url=http://www.u2gigs.com/Ultra_Violet_%28Light_My_Way%29-s145.html |title=U2 Ultra Violet (Light My Way) - U2 on tour |work=U2gigs.com |accessdate=2009-11-15}}</ref> The Edge played the song on his [[Gibson Explorer]].

The song was revived a decade and a half later with the launch of the [[U2 360<U+00B0> Tour]] on 30 June 2009 in [[Barcelona]],<ref name="u2gigs"/> where it was once again performed as part of the encore. It was introduced by a robotic voice reading excerpts from the poem "[[Funeral Blues]]" by [[W. H. Auden]], followed by Bono's appearance wearing a laser-studded jacket on a darkened stage illuminated only by a glowing steering wheel-shaped microphone that hangs from above.<ref name="rs-snl"/> During the performance, Bono would alternatively embrace or hang from the microphone, or twirl around it, or swing it overhead to emphasize the lyrics.<ref name="trib-360"/>  The ''[[New York Times]]'' said its use as "a love song that can double as devotional" helped keep the show's music and messages in balance,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/25/arts/music/25u2.html |title=U2 in the Round, Fun With a Mission |first=Jon |last=Pareles |authorlink=Jon Pareles | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=2009-09-24}}</ref> while the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' said that Bono sang the song with fervor as part of an encore during which "the show's outsized ambitions produced a neon-lighted moment that nearly justified the costly enterprise."<ref name="trib-360">{{cite news |url=http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/turn_it_up/2009/09/concert-review-u2-360-tour-at-soldier-field.html |title=Concert review: U2 360 Tour at Soldier Field |first=Greg |last=Kot |authorlink=Greg Kot | newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=2009-09-12}}</ref>  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called the song's performance "one of the show's highpoints."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/09/13/u2-reinvent-the-stadium-show-as-360-tour-launches-in-chicago/ |title=U2 Reinvent the Stadium Show as 360 Tour Launches in Chicago |first=Andy |last=Greene |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2009-09-13}}</ref>  "Ultraviolet" continued to be performed during the encore throughout the first two legs of the tour, with minor changes such as the use of a different introduction.
