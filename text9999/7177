== Etymology ==
The name Nantes, {{pronounced|n<U+0251><U+0303><U+02D0>t}} in [[French language|French]], derives from that of its pre-Roman-era inhabitants, the [[Gaul]]ish tribe known as the ''[[Namn<U+00E8>ti]]''. The city was called ''[[Portus Namnetus]]'', during Roman occupation. The inhabitants of Nantes are known in French as ''Nantais'' ({{IPA|[n<U+0251><U+0303>.t<U+025B>]}}).

Nantes' most common nickname is as the ''Venice of the West'' ({{lang-fr|La Venise de l'Ouest}}, {{lang-br|Venezia ar C'hornog}}),<ref>[http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/destinationFrance/venues/venue=74/index.html The Venice of the West] RugbyWorldCup.com. Retrieved on 07-12-07.</ref> a name owing to its position on the [[river delta]] of the [[Loire]], the [[Erdre]], and the [[S<U+00E8>vre Nantaise|S<U+00E8>vre]] (whose tributaries were infilled in the early 20th century).<ref>[http://me.franceguide.com/what-to-do/cities-of-france/OT-Nantes-Metropole.html?nodeID=120&CpyEditoId=115448 Blue Nantes] FranceGuide.com.

[[Image:Feydeau Nantes 2.JPG|thumb|left|L'<U+00EE>le Feydeau]]
Originally founded as a town by the [[List of peoples of Gaul|Gallic tribe]] named Namn<U+00E8>ti around 70 BC, Nantes was conquered by [[Julius Caesar]] in 56 BC and named ''Portus Namnetus''. Christianised in the 3rd century AD, the city was successively invaded by the [[Saxons]] (around 285), the [[Franks]] (around 500), the [[Brython|Britons]] (in the 6th and 7th centuries) and the [[Normans]], who laid it waste in 843: ''"The city of Nantes remained for many years deserted, devastated and overgrown with briars and thorns."'' The [[Chronicle of Nantes]] continues until the year 946, telling that [[Alain Barbe-Torte]], grandson of Alan the Great, the last king of [[Brittany]] who was expelled by the Norse, drove them out and founded the [[Duchy of Brittany]].<ref>David C Douglas, ed. ''English Historical Documents'' (Routledge, 1979) "Secular Narrative Sources" pp 345f.</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=EUSqIR2qaaIC&pg=PA345&lpg=PA345&dq=the+city+of+nantes+remained+for+many+years+deserted+devastated+and+overgrown+with+briars+and+thorns&source=web&ots=bEZsuXxRnR&sig=6HLYBIhCTbbyxi3i79yZ4lRqO4k#PPA345,M1 Chronicle of Nantes] English Historical Documents.

When the Duchy of Brittany was annexed by the kingdom of France in 1532, Nantes kept the [[Parliament of Brittany]] for a few years, before it was moved to [[Rennes]]. In 1598, King [[Henry IV of France]] signed the [[Edict of Nantes]] here, which granted [[Protestant]]s rights to their religion.

During the 18th century, prior to [[abolition of slavery]], Nantes was the [[slave trade]] capital of France. This kind of trade led Nantes to become the largest port in France and a wealthy city. When the [[French Revolution]] broke out, Nantes chose to be part of it, although the whole surrounding region soon degenerated into an open civil war against the new republic known as the [[War in the Vend<U+00E9>e]]. On [[29 June]] [[1793]] the town was the site of [[Battle of Nantes|a Republican victory]] in this war. The Loire was the site of tens, perhaps hundreds of thousands of executions by drowning, including those using the method which came to be known as the [[Republican marriage]], in which a man and a woman were stripped naked, tied together, and thrown into the river.

In the 19th century, Nantes became an industrial city. The first public transport anywhere may have been the [[bus|omnibus]] service initiated in Nantes in 1826. {{Fact|date=May 2008}} It was soon imitated in [[Paris]], [[London]] and [[New York]]. The first railways were built in 1851 and many industries were created. In 1940, the city was occupied by [[Nazi Germany|German]] troops. In 1941, the murder of a German officer, Lt. Col. [[Fritz Hotz]], caused the retaliatory execution of 48 civilians.<!--many sources state "50"--> The city was twice severely bombed by British forces, on 16 and 23 August 1943, before being liberated by the Americans in 1944.<ref>[http://www.reception.com/US/nantes/histoire.htm reception - tourisme/culture - France - Nantes - histoire page<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Until the 1970s, Nantes' harbour was located on the [[<U+00CE>le de Nantes]], when it was moved to the very mouth of the Loire river, at [[Saint-Nazaire]]. In the subsequent 20 years, many [[service sector]] organisations moved into the area, but economic difficulties forced most of these to close. In 2001, a major redevelopment scheme was launched, the goal of which is to revitalise the island as the new city centre.<ref>[http://www.revit-nweurope.org/ventura/engine.php?Cmd=see&P_site=621&P_self=74&PMax=0&PSkip=0&PHPSESSID=f688e4be6c8382e1bc57f2dc285e26bf Revit Metropolitan Development]</ref>

==Geography==
Nantes is located on the banks of the [[Loire River]], at the [[confluence]] of the [[Erdre]] and the [[S<U+00E8>vre Nantaise]], 55&nbsp;km (35&nbsp;mi) from the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The city was built in a place where many branches of the Loire river created several islands, but most of those branches were filled in at the beginning of the 20th century (and the confluence with the Erdre river diverted and covered) due to the increasing car traffic.

Nantes is at the exact centre of the Earth's [[land hemisphere]].

===Climate===
About 50 kilometers away from the coast, Nantes has generally cool winters and mild summers, with rainfalls at least every week, which makes Nantes a temperate city, though winters can be freezy and summers hot, especially during the month of July.<ref>[http://www.climate-zone.com/climate/france/Celsius/nantes.htm Climate information for Nantes] Retrieved on 08-09-07.</ref>

== Politics ==
{{see|Urban Community of Nantes|List of mayors of Nantes}}
Nantes is the ''[[Pr<U+00E9>fectures in France|pr<U+00E9>fecture]]'' (capital city) of both the [[Loire-Atlantique]] ''[[d<U+00E9>partement in France|d<U+00E9>partement]]'' and the [[Pays de la Loire]] ''[[r<U+00E9>gion in France|r<U+00E9>gion]]''.

The Nantes [[Urban Community of Nantes|metropolitan area]] (''Nantes M<U+00E9>tropole'') is the [[Communes in France#Intercommunality|intercommunal]] structure connecting the city of Nantes with nearby suburbs. It had a 1999 population of 554,478, 48.7% of which comprised the city of Nantes. The current mayor of Nantes is [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]] ([[Socialist Party (France)|PS]]), first elected in 1989 and now serving a fourth term, until 2014.<ref>[http://www.nantes.fr/mairie/municipalite/delegations-d-elus/jean-marc-ayrault.html Ville de Nantes: Jean-Marc Ayrault<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

=== Neighbourhoods ===
Since 1995, Nantes has been divided into 11 neighbourhoods, each resembling an historic city quarter. Each of these neighbourhoods is controlled by a ''Comit<U+00E9> Consultatif'' (Consultative Committee), comprising directly elected officials and a team of municipal members, similar to a [[New England]] [[board of selectmen]]. These neighbourhoods are:
{|
|valign=top|
* Centre-ville
* Bellevue-Chantenay-Sainte Anne
* Dervalli<U+00E8>res-Zola
* Hauts-Pav<U+00E9>s-Saint-F<U+00E9>lix

* Breil-Barberie
* Nantes-Nord
|valign=top|
* Nantes-Erdre
* Botti<U+00E8>re-Doulon
* Nantes-Sud

Nine of these neighbourhoods are situated on the right bank of the [[Loire]], one is on the left bank, and one is on the <U+00CE>le de Nantes island.

=== Nantes and Brittany ===
[[Image:PLflag.gif|thumb|right|230px|Flag of the [[Pays de la Loire]]]]
[[Image:Flag of Brittany.svg|thumb|right|230px|Flag of [[Bretagne]]]]
The city of Nantes, and the Loire-Atlantique ''d<U+00E9>partement'', were formerly part of the historic province of [[Brittany]]; Nantes was one of its former capitals, along with [[Rennes]].<ref>[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/fr-44-na.html Presentation of Nantes] CRWFlags.com. Published on 28-04-07. Retrieved on 07-12-07.</ref>

Historically, the country around Nantes ({{lang-fr|Le Pays Nantais}}; {{lang-br|Bro Naoned}}; [[Gallo language|Gallo]]: ''Pae<U+00EF> de N<U+00E0>ntt'') was always seen as being part of Brittany. In 1207, the [[Dukes of Brittany]] made Nantes their home, building the [[Castle of the Dukes of Brittany]] on the banks of the Loire. Most of the dukes and duchesses were buried in either the cathedral or the nearby abbeys.

In 1789, the separation of the [[Provinces of France|historical provinces of France]] resulted in Brittany being split in five; the lower of the five, ''Loire-Inf<U+00E9>rieure'' (today Loire-Atlantique) was where Nantes was situated. As such, Brittany as an administrative region did not exist during the 19th and early 20th centuries, although it did still exist culturally and informally.<ref>[http://www2.phys.canterbury.ac.nz/~wjt23/Horn.html Reviews of <em>The Life and Science of L<U+00E9>on Foucault. The Man who Proved the Earth Rotates.</em><!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> When regional regroupments during the 20th century resulted in the reinstatement of the regions, Loire-Atlantique found itself split from the other four ''d<U+00E9>partements'' by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] in 1941; a new ''r<U+00E9>gion'' had been created centred on Nantes, the [[Pays de la Loire]].

Much debate surrounding this move persists. Those against (sometimes called the ''Breton militants'') maintain that the separation was made by a non-democratically elected government, and that Loire-Atlantique is culturally, historically and geographically united to Brittany; those in favour argue that any reunification would reopen a "quarrel of the capitals" between Nantes and Rennes, and that it would be fatal to the [[Pays de la Loire]] ''r<U+00E9>gion''.<ref>[http://www.hsminternational.net/loireatlantique.htm Loire-Atlantique guide]</ref>

The issue of linguistics is also relevant; in the east of Brittany (variously called ''Bretagne Gall<U+00E8>se'' or ''Haute Bretagne'') [[Romance languages]] especially the local [[Gallo]], as well as [[French language|French]], have long had more influence than Breton. However, in many large cities, including Nantes and [[Saint-Brieuc]], the Breton language has sometimes been spoken more widely by the very urban and ''bourgeois'' population there (even though in ''Le Pays Nantais'' the opposite was true). In recent years, many bilingual plaques have appeared on tourist attractions in the city, with the help of the [[Ofis ar brezhoneg]] ({{lang-fr|Office de la Langue Bretonne}}; {{lang-en|Office of the Breton Language}}).

Most recently, on 15 May 2004, a hastily organised demonstration in Nantes calling for the reunification of Brittany attracted 6,000 participants, while in five surveys on the issue, between 62% and 75% of the population of Loire-Atlantique have come out in favour of reunification.<ref>[http://www.breizh.net/icdbl/saozg/endangered.htm#Does%20the%20Breton%20language%20have%20a%20future Does the Breton language have a future?] Breizh.net, May 2004.

==Demographics==
As of the 1999 census, there were 270,251 inhabitants in the [[Commune in France|commune]] of Nantes. The population density was 4260 persons/km<U+00B2>. There were 711,120 inhabitants in the [[aire urbaine|metropolitan area]].{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

As of February 2004 estimates, the population of the city of Nantes has reached 285,800 inhabitants.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

The local [[football (soccer)|football]] team is [[FC Nantes Atlantique]]. During the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] in France, Nantes hosted a number of matches including [[England]] against [[Samoa]] and [[Wales]] against [[Fiji]].

The Celtic band ''[[Tri Yann]]'' was originally known as ''Tri Yann an Naoned'' (the three Johns from Nantes).

On [[December 31]], [[2006]], some 600 people gathered in Nantes to facetiously protest the arrival of the New Year. They marched and held up banners that read "No to 2007" and "Now is better!" The protesters asked several governments and even the [[United Nations|UN]] to declare a moratorium on the future. When the clock ticked past midnight, indicating the arrival of 2007, the protesters happily began to cheer "No to 2008!" The organisers claimed that they would stage the same event at the end of 2007, but this time on the [[Champs-<U+00C9>lys<U+00E9>es]] avenue in [[Paris]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6222153.stm French marchers say 'non' to 2007] [[BBC News]], 1 January 2007.

==Transport==
[[Image:Tramway Nantes new model moutonnerie station.jpg|thumb|250px|The tramway of Nantes]]
The [[bus|omnibus]], the first organized public transit system within a city, appears to have originated in Nantes in 1826.<ref>[http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch6en/conc6en/omni.html Omnibus, Paris Late 19th century] Dr. Jean-Paul Rodrigue, Dept. of Economics & Geography, [[Hofstra University]]. Retrieved 9 August 2007.</ref> The [[Tramway de Nantes]] began operation in 1879, but would close in 1958. The system was reopened in 1985, and is now the largest tramway network in France.<ref>[http://www.lrta.info/articles/art0101.html City tram now a mature network] [[Tramways & Urban Transit]], January 2001. Retrieved 9 August 2007.</ref> ''Transport de l'agglom<U+00E9>ration nantaise'' (TAN) operate three tramway lines, one [[BusWay]] line, dozens of bus lines, and two navibus lines. It is also in partnership with [[SNCF]] to allow users to travel within the city's limits on four intercity train lines.

Current expansion projects on the tram network include the extension of line one and a link between lines one and two on the northern part of the network. One more station is currently under construction on the north side of line three. {{Fact|date=April 2008}} Line three replaces line two on its south side, which now ends at Neustrie, near [[Nantes Atlantique Airport]]. Line two now ends in the borough of Rez<U+00E9> at a new station named ''Gare de Pont Rousseau'', which is connected to a suburban train station of the same name.

Nantes lies on a number of rail lines, including several [[TGV]] lines. Nantes is connected via TGV to [[Paris]], [[Lyon]], [[Marseille]], [[Lille]], and [[Strasbourg]]. By [[Corail (train)|Corail]] (classical train), Nantes is connected to [[Quimper, Finist<U+00E8>re|Quimper]], [[La Rochelle]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Lyon]], and [[Toulouse]]. [[Transport express r<U+00E9>gional]] (TER, regional transport) links to [[Saint-Nazaire]], [[Angers]], [[Le Mans]], [[La Roche sur Yon]], and many other regional cities.

[[Nantes Atlantique Airport]], located to the southwest, serves the city and surrounding areas. It is the biggest airport in northwestern France, linking with several French and European cities, as well as [[Montreal]] in Canada.
