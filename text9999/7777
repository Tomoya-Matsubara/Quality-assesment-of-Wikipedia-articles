"'''It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)'''" is a song written and performed by [[Bob Dylan]] and first released on his 1965 album, ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]''. It was written in the summer of 1964, first performed live on October 10, 1964, and recorded on January 15, 1965.  Described by Dylan biographer [[Howard Sounes]] as a "grim masterpiece," the song features some of Dylan's most memorable lyrical images. Among the well-known lines sung in the song are "Money doesn't talk, it swears," "Although the masters make the rules, for the wisemen and the fools" and "But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked."  The lyrics express Dylan's anger at hypocrisy, commercialism, consumerism, warmongers and contemporary American culture, but unlike his earlier protest songs, "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" does not express optimism in the possibility of political solutions.  

Dylan has stated that "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" is one of his songs that means the most to him, and he has played the song often in live concerts.  Since its original release on ''Bringing It All Back Home'', live versions of the song have been issued on ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall]]'', ''[[Before the Flood]]'' and ''[[Bob Dylan at Budokan]]''.  Dylan can also be seen performing the song in the film ''[[Don't Look Back]]'' and the video of the HBO special ''Hard to Handle''.  The song has been covered by a number of other artists, including [[Roger McGuinn]], [[The Byrds]], [[Billy Preston]], [[Hugo Race]], [[Terence Trent D'Arby]], [[Mick Farren]], [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Marilyn Scott]], and [[The Duhks]].

==Bob Dylan's version==

Dylan biographer Howard Sounes described "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" as a "grim masterpiece."<ref name=Sounes/>  The only accompaniment is Dylan's guitar, playing [[folk-blues]] riffs and up and down [[Guitar chord|chord]] progressions.<ref name=allmusic/>  Authour Sean Wilentz has noted that the song's [[chord (music)|chord]] structure is similar to that used by the [[Everly Brothers]]' in their [[Hit single|hit]] recording of "[[Wake Up Little Susie]]".<ref>{{cite book|title=Bob Dylan in America|author=Wilentz, Sean|page=324|year=2010|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=978-0-38552988-4}}</ref> The lyrics of "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" express Dylan's anger at hypocrisy, commercialism, consumerism, warmongers and contemporary American culture.<ref name=allmusic/><ref name=rough>{{Cite book|title=The Rough Guide to Bob Dylan|author=Williamson, Nigel|pages=224<U+2013>225|year=2006|edition=2nd edition|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-84353-718-2}}</ref><ref name=gill>{{Cite book|author=Gill, Andy|title=Don't Think Twice, It's All Right|publisher=Thunder Mountain Press|page=76|year=1998|isbn=1-56025-185-9}}</ref>  In his book ''[[Bob Dylan, Performing Artist]]'', author [[Paul Williams (Crawdaddy! creator)|Paul Williams]] has suggested that the song addresses "the possibility that the most important (and least articulated) political issue of our times is that we are all being fed a false picture of reality, and it's coming at us from every direction."<ref name=williams>{{Cite book|title=Bob Dylan Performing Artist: The Early Years 1960<U+2013>1973|author=[[Paul Williams (Crawdaddy! creator)|Williams, Paul]]|pages=131<U+2013>132|year=1990, 1991|publisher=Underwood Miller|isbn=0-88733-131-9}}</ref>  Williams goes on to say that the song successfully paints a portrait of an "alienated individual identifying the characteristics of the world around him and thus declaring his freedom from its 'rules'."<ref name=williams/>  As such, a major target in the song is the old, established concepts which give a false picture of reality and hinder new worldviews from being accepted.<ref name=williams/>  

While it shares a sense of prevailing entropy with the previous song on the album, "Gates of Eden", the critique in "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" is more direct and less allusive.<ref name=gill/>  Author Michael Gray has commented that although the vitriol Dylan unleashes towards his targets is similar to his earlier political protest songs, "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" is a transitionary song in that it does not express optimism in the possibility of political solutions.<ref name=gray>{{Cite book|title=Song and Dance Man III|author=Gray, Michael|pages=133<U+2013>134|year=2000|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0-8264-5160-0}}</ref>  Instead, Dylan sings in a new prophetic voice that would later become his trademark.<ref name=hinchey>{{Cite book|title=Like a Complete Unknown|author=Hinchey, John|pages=88<U+2013>94|year=2002|publisher=Stealing Home Press|isbn=0-9723592-0-6}}</ref>  However, with the political pessimism comes a more poetic vision than in his earlier protest songs, along with a more complex figurative language.<ref name=gray/>  Howard Sounes notes that the song features some of Dylan's most memorable images.<ref name=Sounes>{{Cite book| last = Sounes | first = Howard | title = Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan | publisher = Grove Press | location = New York | page = 168 |year = 2001 | isbn = 0-0821-1686-8}}</ref>  The opening lines begin the song's torrent of [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] images:<ref name=allmusic/>
:''Darkness at the break of noon
:''Shadows even the silver spoon
:''The handmade blade, the child's balloon
:''Eclipses both the sun and moon
:''To understand you know too soon
:''There is no sense in trying
According to Seth Rogovoy, this opening echoes the Book of [[Ecclesiastes]], where the author states (1:17) "I observed all deeds beneath the sun, and behold all is futile.<ref name=prophet>{{Cite book|title=Bob Dylan: Prophet, Mystic, Poet|author=Rogovoy, Seth|pages=84&ndash;86|year=2009|publisher=Scribner|isbn=978-1-4165-5915-3}}</ref>   There are echoes of Ecclesiastes throughout the song.  Another example is:<ref name=prophet/>
:''The masters make the rules
:''For the wise man and the fools.
The author of Ecclesiastes laments (2:15&ndash;16) "The fate of the fool will befall me also; to what advantage, then, have I become wise?  But I come to the conclusion that this, too, was futility, because the wise man and the fool are both forgotten.  The wise man dies, just like the fool."

One of the most famous lines from the song reminds listeners that even the most powerful people will ultimately be judged:<ref name=allmusic/><ref name=keys/>
:''But even the president of the United States
:''Sometimes must have to stand naked
These lines seemed particularly prescient when Dylan performed the song on his [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|1974 tour]] with [[The Band]], a few months before [[Richard Nixon]] resigned as President of the United States as a result of the [[Watergate]] crisis.<ref name=keys>{{Cite book|title=Keys to the Rain|author=Trager, Oliver|pages=322<U+2013>324|year=2004|publisher=Billboard Books|isbn=0-8230-7974-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Bob Dylan: A Descriptive, Critical Discography and Filmography, 1961&ndash;2007|author=Nogowski, John|edition=Second|pages=29, 64|year=2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3518-0}}</ref>  After the song has confronted sex, religion and politics, it end with the lines:<ref name=heylin/><ref>{{cite web|title=It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding) lyrics|url=http://www.bobdylan.com/#/songs/its-alright-ma-im-only-bleeding|author=[[Bob Dylan|Dylan, Bob]]|publisher=bobdylan.com|accessdate=2010-12-31}}</ref>
:''And if my thought-dreams could be seen
:''They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
:''But it's alright, Ma, it's life and life only
Throughout the song, the words pour out quickly, with Dylan barely taking a breath between lines, so that the intricate rhyming structure is often missed: AAAAAB CCCCCB DDDDDB in the verses and AAB in the chorus.<ref name=heylin2/><ref name=allmusic/>

Dylan has cited "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" as one of his songs that means the most to him.<ref name=heylin2/>  In 1980 he stated that "I don't think I could sit down now and write 'It's Alright, Ma' again.  I wouldn't even know where to begin, but I can still sing it."<ref name=heylin2/>  The song has featured often in Dylan's live concerts, and concert performances of it have been released on ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall]]'' (recorded on October 31, 1964), ''[[Before the Flood]]'' (recorded in 1974) and ''[[Bob Dylan at Budokan]]'' (recorded in 1978).<ref name=allmusic>{{Cite web|title=It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)|url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t1991560|pure_url=yes}}|author=Ruhlmann, William|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2010-07-17}}</ref>  Dylan also played the song on his [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] Tour in 1975 and 1976, as well as on his 1978 tour and his [[Never Ending Tour]] from the late 1980s up to the present.<ref name=keys/>  Footage of Dylan playing "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" is included in the film ''[[Don't Look Back]]'', and a live performance of Dylan playing the song with [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]] is included in the video of the HBO special ''Hard to Handle''.<ref name=allmusic/><ref>{{cite web|title=Hard to Handle (Video)|author=Ruhlmann, William|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hard-to-handle-video-r85978|publisher=[[allmusic]]|accessdate=2010-12-31}}</ref>  Dylan also sang this song at his 1993 30th anniversary celebration concert at [[Madison Square Garden]], which was released on ''[[The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration]]'' album.<ref name=madison>{{Cite web|title=Bob Dylan: 30th Anniversary Celebration|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1429555|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[allmusic]]|accessdate=2010-07-17}}</ref>  The studio recording was re-released on the 2008 compilation album ''Playlist: The Very Best of Bob Dylan '60s''.<ref name=allmusic/>

==Cover versions==
Arguably the most widely known [[Cover version|cover]] of the song is that performed by [[Roger McGuinn]] for the soundtrack of the 1969 film, ''[[Easy Rider]]''.  The film's scriptwriter and star, [[Peter Fonda]], had originally intended to use Dylan's version of the song in the film but after failing to secure the appropriate licensing he asked McGuinn to record a cover of it instead.<ref name=keys/><ref name=timeless>{{Cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|page=290|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-95295-401-X}}</ref>  Although McGuinn's version of "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" was listed as a solo performance on the [[Easy Rider (soundtrack)|''Easy Rider'' soundtrack album]], it actually features McGuinn on guitar and vocals, accompanied by his bandmate from [[The Byrds]], [[Gene Parsons]], on [[harmonica]].<ref name=timeless/> 

The Byrds themselves, also recorded a version of the song during the 1970 [[Studio recording|recording sessions]] for their album ''[[Untitled (The Byrds album)|(Untitled)]]'' but it was not included in the final track listing.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Untitled|publisher=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://ebni.com/byrds/lpunt.html|accessdate=2009-10-21}}</ref>  The Byrds occasionally performed the song in [[Rock concert|concert]] during 1970 and a live recording of it, from a March 1, 1970 appearance at the [[Madison Square Garden|Felt Forum]], was included on the 2000 remaster of the ''(Untitled)'' album, which was re-titled as ''(Untitled)/(Unissued)''.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|pages=591<U+2013>615|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-95295-401-X}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Untitled: The Byrds|author=Unterberger, Richie|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=untitled-untitledunissued-r3069/review|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2010-11-29}}</ref>  This version also appears as a bonus track on the 2002 remastered version of the compilation album, ''[[The Byrds Play Dylan]]'', and on the 2006 4-disc box set ''[[There Is a Season]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding): The Byrds|url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=its-alright-ma-im-only-bleeding-t5563250|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref>

In 1971, Nannie Parres included "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" on her album ''I Thought About You'' and in 1973 [[Billy Preston]] included the song on ''[[Everybody Likes Some Kind Of Music]]''.<ref name=keys/>  Bettina Jonic included a cover of the song on her 1975 album ''The Bitter Mirror''.<ref name=keys/>  Artists who have covered the song since then include [[Hugo Race]], [[Terence Trent D'Arby]], [[Mick Farren]], [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Marilyn Scott]], and [[The Duhks]].<ref name=keys/><ref>{{cite web|title=It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding): Terence Trent D'Arby|url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=its-alright-ma-im-only-bleeding-t17891208|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding): Mick Farren|url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=its-alright-ma-im-only-bleeding-t5052873|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding): Caetano Veloso|url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=its-alright-ma-im-only-bleeding-t6942456|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding): Marilyn Scott|url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=its-alright-ma-im-only-bleeding-t8835105|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding): The Duhks|url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=its-alright-ma-im-only-bleeding-t17801792|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref>

==Influence==
[[Clinton Heylin]], in his biography ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', wrote that the recording "opened up a whole new genre of finger-pointing song, not just for Dylan but for the entire panoply of pop." To this, Heylin adds that "It's Alright, Ma" probably contained more "memorable aphorisms" than any of Dylan's songs.<ref name=heylin/>  One of these lines is "he not busy being born is busy dying," from the song's second verse, which was used by [[Jimmy Carter]] in his Presidential nomination acceptance speech at the [[1976 Democratic National Convention]].<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/05/04/reviews/dylan-50.html | title=Out of the 60's, Into His 50's | author=Marsh, Dave | publisher=[[New York Times|NYTimes.com]] | date=May 19, 1991 | accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref>  During his campaign for President in 2000, [[Al Gore]] told talk show host [[Oprah Winfrey]] that this was his favorite quotation.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://graphics.boston.com/news/politics/campaign2000/news/VP_cashes_in_on_golden_opportunity_Oprah_+.shtml | title=VP cashes in on golden opportunity: 'Oprah' | publisher=[[Boston Globe]] | author=Kranish, Michael | date=September 12, 2000 | accessdate=2008-02-27 }}</ref>

Another example is the line "Money doesn't talk, it swears," which appears in ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]''.<ref>{{Cite book| url=http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=quot&freesearch=bob+dylan&branch=14123648&textsearchtype=exact | title=Search Results for "Bob Dylan" | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | work=[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations|Little Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]] | accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref> In addition, the ''Columbia Dictionary of Quotations'' lists this as well as three other lines from the song: "Although the masters make the rules, for the wisemen and the fools," "But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked" and "Everything from toy guns that spark to flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark, it's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred."<ref>{{Cite book| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=4cl5c4T9LWkC | last = Andrews | first = Robert | title = The Columbia Dictionary of Quotations | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1993 | pages = 35, 181, 598, 727 | isbn = 0231071949 | accessdate = 2009-04-28}}</ref>  Other well-known lines include "Propaganda, all is phony" and "Advertising signs they con you into thinking you're the one."<ref name=keys/>

In a 2005 reader's poll reported in ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine, "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" was listed as the #8 all-time greatest Bob Dylan song, and a similar poll of artists ranked the song at #21.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Mojo: 100 Greatest Dylan Songs|publisher=''Mojo''|date=September 2005|pages=54&ndash;85|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/mojo_p4.htm#Bob%20Dylan%20Songs|accessdate=2010-07-19}}</ref>  In 2002, ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' magazine listed it as the #5 all-time Dylan song.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Uncut <U+2013> Top 40 Dylan Tracks|publisher=''Uncut''|pages=112&ndash;117|year=2002|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/uncut.htm#Dylan|accessdate=2010-07-19}}</ref>  The song was featured in [[Made in America (The Sopranos)|the final episode]] of ''[[The Sopranos]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Soundtracks for "The Sopranos" Made in America|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995839/soundtrack|publisher=imdb|accessdate=2010-07-18}}</ref>  It has also been referenced by other songwriters. For instance, the indie-rocker [[Stephen Malkmus]] quotes "It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" at the end of his song "Jo-Jo's Jacket" from Malkmus' debut solo album.<ref>{{Cite web|title=In Brief: Stephen Malkmus|author=Levine, Robert|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/music/pop/reviews/4415/|publisher=[[New York Magazine]]|accessdate=2010-07-18}}</ref>
