'''Frank Leroy Chance''' (September 9, 1876&nbsp;<U+2013> September 15, 1924) was an American [[professional baseball]] player. A [[first baseman]], Chance played in [[Major League Baseball]] for the [[Chicago Cubs]] (initially named the "Orphans") and [[New York Yankees]] from 1898 through 1914. He also served as [[manager (baseball)|manager]] of the Cubs, Yankees, and [[Boston Red Sox]].

Discovered by the Cubs as he played [[semi-professional]] baseball while attending college, Chance debuted with the Cubs in 1898, serving as a part-time player. In 1903, Chance became the Cubs' regular first baseman, and in 1905, he succeeded [[Frank Selee]] as the team's manager. Chance led the Cubs to four [[National League]] championships in the span of five years (1906<U+2013>1910) and won the [[World Series]] championships in 1907 and 1908. With [[Joe Tinker]] and [[Johnny Evers]], Chance formed a strong [[double play]] combination, which was immortalized as "Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance" in "[[Baseball's Sad Lexicon]]".

Let go by the Cubs after the 1912 season, Chance signed with the Yankees, serving as a player<U+2013>manager for two seasons. He joined the [[Los Angeles Angels]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]] as a player<U+2013>manager, returning to MLB in 1923 as manager of the Red Sox. Chance was named the manager of the [[Chicago White Sox]] in 1924, but never took control of the team as he became ill. He died later that year.

Noted for his leadership abilities, Chance earned the nickname "Peerless Leader". He is the all-time leader in managerial [[winning percentage]] in Cubs history. Chance was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946|1946 balloting]] by the [[Veterans Committee]], along with Tinker and Evers.

==Early life==

While playing baseball for the school's baseball team, he received an offer to play [[semi-professional]] baseball for a team in [[Sullivan, Illinois]], for $40 a month (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|40|1896}}}} in current dollar terms), which he accepted.<ref name=evening/>

==Career==

===Chicago Cubs===
Chance began his career in 1898 with the Chicago Cubs, serving as a reserve catcher and outfielder. He played irregularly through the 1902 season. Due in part to finger injuries suffered while catching, Chance played in no more than 75 games in a season through 1902.<ref name=sabr/> In 1903, [[Johnny Kling]] became the Cubs' full-time catcher. As [[Bill Hanlon]], the Cubs' [[first baseman]], left the team, [[manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Frank Selee]] moved Chance to first base. Though Chance initially balked at the position change, he agreed when he received a pay raise.<ref name=sabr/>

In 125 games during the 1903 season, Chance recorded a .327 [[batting average]], and 67 [[stolen base]]s; both of these marks led the [[National League]] (NL). His .439 [[on-base percentage]] was third-best in the league, behind [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Roger Bresnahan]], and his 81 [[Run batted in|runs batted in]] (RBIs) tied [[Jake Beckley]] for sixth-best.<ref name=sabr/> Chance had a .310 batting average in 1904, good for sixth place in the NL.

Chance also hit six [[home run]]s, tying him with [[Dan McGann]], [[Red Dooin]], and [[Cozy Dolan]] for third place, his 42 stolen bases tied McGann for fourth place, and his 89 [[run (baseball)|runs scored]] were seventh-best.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1904-batting-leaders.shtml |title=1904 National League Batting Leaders |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2012}}</ref>

Selee fell ill in 1905, and Chance was selected to succeed him as manager.<ref name=sabr/> That year, he also batted .316 with 92 runs scored and 70 RBIs. His batting average was sixth-best in the NL, while he led the league with a .450 on-base percentage, and finished seventh with a .434 slugging percentage. His 38 stolen bases were sixth-best in the league.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1905-batting-leaders.shtml |title=1905 National League Batting Leaders |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2012}}</ref> In 1906, Chance batted .319 and led the NL in runs scored (103) and stolen bases (57).

Chance began to decline during the 1908 season.

===New York Yankees===
In 1912, Chance endured surgeries to correct [[blood clot]]s in his brain that were caused by being [[hit by pitch]]es in his head. Meanwhile, Chance argued with Murphy, who had been releasing expensive players from the Cubs in an effort to save the team money.<ref name=sabr/> The [[New York Yankees]] negotiated for Chance's release from the Cubs after the 1912 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zg9VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Nz0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=2009,4628926&dq=frank-chance&hl=en|title=Yankees Get Frank Chance: Release of Peerless Leader Formally Purchased for Sum of $1,500<U+2014>Signs Tuesday|page=10|newspaper=The Paterson Press|date=January 3, 1913|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}</ref> The Cubs released Chance while he was hospitalized,<ref name=sabr/> and in January 1913, Chance signed a three-year contract with the Yankees, worth $120,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|120000|1913}}}} in current dollar terms), to serve as the Yankees' manager.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8owLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BVQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4738,2991849&dq=frank-chance&hl=en|title=Frank Chance Manager of New York Yankees: Immense Salary Will Be Paid Former Leader of the Cubs<U+2014>Contract For Three Years|page=6|newspaper=The Evening Independent|date=January 9, 1913|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}</ref> He also played first base for the Yankees<ref>{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20C15FA385F13738DDDA80994DA405B838DF1D3 |title=Frank Chance Here&nbsp;<U+2014> To Play First Base&nbsp;<U+2014> Yankees' New Manager Intends to Get Into the Game Again Next Season|newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 11, 1913 |accessdate=September 20, 2012}}</ref> and served as field captain, though he played in no more than 12 games in a season.<ref name=sabr/> The Yankees sat in last place on the next-to-last day of the 1913 season, but won their final game to finish in seventh place.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eu4gAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QHIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1336,933167&dq=frank-chance&hl=en|title=Yankees in Last Place: Houk Knows How Frank Chance Felt|first=Ed, Jr.|last=Schuyler|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Day|location=[[New London, Connecticut]]|page=20|date=September 8, 1966|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}</ref> In 1914, Chance named [[Roger Peckinpaugh]] the Yankees' new captain.<ref>{{cite web|first=Peter |last=Gordon |url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/829dbefb |title=Roger Peckinpaugh |publisher=Society for American Baseball Research |accessdate=March 21, 2012}}</ref>

After struggling during the 1914 season, Chance criticized the talent brought to him by Yankees scout [[Arthur Irwin]]. After repeatedly seeking to have Irwin fired, he offered his resignation from the team late in the season on the condition that he still was to receive his 1915 salary.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40712FC3E5912738DDDAD0994D1405B848DF1D3 |title=Chance Says He Or Irwin Must Go&nbsp;<U+2014> Peerless Leader Dissatisfied with Yankee Scout <U+2013> - Wants Better Players|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 14, 1914|accessdate=September 20, 2012}}</ref> After this was accepted by team owner [[Frank J.

===Career summary===
Chance was part of the trio of infielders remembered for their double-play ability, with [[Joe Tinker]] and [[Johnny Evers]]. The trio were immortalized as "Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance", also known as "[[Baseball's Sad Lexicon]]," written by the 28-year-old ''[[New York Evening Mail]]'' newspaper columnist [[Franklin Pierce Adams]] in July 1910.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ashley|first=Sally|year=1986|title=F.P.A.: The Life and Times of Franklin P.
