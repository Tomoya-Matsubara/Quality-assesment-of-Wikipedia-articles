'''Genetically modified foods''' or '''biotech foods''' are foods derived from [[genetically modified organism]]s (GMOs). Genetically modified organisms have had specific changes introduced into their DNA by [[genetic engineering]] techniques. These techniques are much more precise<ref>[http://www.gmsciencedebate.org.uk/report/pdf/gmsci-report1-full.pdf Usa Government Science Review First Report], Prepared by the GM Science Review panel (July 2003). Chairman Professor Sir David King, Chief Scientific Advisor to the UK Government, P 9: "...it is necessary to produce about 100 GM plants to obtain one that has the desirable characters for its use as a basis of a new GM crop variety. ...Most of these so-called conventional plant breeding methods (such as gene transfer by pollination, mutation breeding, cell selection and induced polyploidy) have a substantially greater discard rate. Mutation breeding, for instance, involves the production of unpredictable and undirected genetic changes and many thousands, even millions, of undesirable plants are discarded in order to identify plants with suitable qualities for further breeding."</ref> than [[mutagenesis]] (mutation breeding) where an organism is exposed to radiation or chemicals to create a non-specific but stable change. Other techniques by which humans modify food organisms include selective breeding; plant breeding, and animal breeding, and [[somaclonal variation]].

Genetically Modified foods (GM foods) were first put on the market in 1996. Typically, genetically modified foods are [[transgenic plant]] products: [[Transgenic soybean|soybean]], [[Transgenic maize|corn]], [[canola]], [[Genetically modified rice|rice]], and [[cotton seed oil]]. Animal products have also been developed, although as of July 2010 none are currently on the market.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Altered animals: Creatures with bonus features|date=14 July 2010|author=Bob Holmes|journal=New Scientist|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727680.300-altered-animals-creatures-with-bonus-features.html}}</ref> In 2006 a pig was<ref>{{Cite journal| year = 2007|title = Why the omega-3 should go to market|journal = Nature Biotechnology|pages = 505<U+2013>506|volume = 25|issue = 5|author = Kang JX|doi = 10.1038/nbt0507-505|pmid = 17483827| author-separator = ,| display-authors = 1| last2 = Leaf| first2 = Alexander}}</ref><ref name=Fiester2006>{{Cite journal| title = Why the omega-3 piggy should not go to market|url = http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1053&context=bioethics_papers

Critics have objected to GM foods on several grounds, including safety issues,<ref name=NRC2004>NRC. (2004). Safety of Genetically Engineered Foods: Approaches to Assessing Unintended Health Effects. National Academies Press. [http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10977#toc Free full text].</ref> [[ecology|ecological]] concerns, and [[economics|economic]] concerns raised by the fact  these organisms are subject to [[intellectual property]] law.

==Method==

Genetic modification involves the insertion or deletion of genes. In the process of [[cisgenesis]], genes are artificially transferred between organisms that could be conventionally bred. In the process of [[transgenesis]], genes from a different species are inserted, which is a form of [[horizontal gene transfer]]. In nature this can occur when [[exogenous DNA]] penetrates the [[cell membrane]] for any reason. To do this artificially may require transferring genes as part of an attenuated virus genome or physically inserting the extra DNA into the nucleus of the intended host using a microsyringe, or as a coating on gold nanoparticles fired from a [[gene gun]]. However, other methods exploit natural forms of gene transfer, such as the ability of ''[[Agrobacterium]]'' to transfer genetic material to plants, and the ability of [[lentiviruses]] to transfer genes to animal cells.''

The method to introduce new genes into plants requires several important factors such as specific promoter, codon usage of the gene and how to deactivate the gene. The specific promoter must relate to area that we want the gene to express. For instance, if we want the gene to express only in the rice instead of the leaf then we would only use an endosperm specific promoter. The reason is because we only want our transgenic genes to express only in the rice and not the leaves. The codon usage of the gene must also be more optimized for the rice since there are several different codons for each of the 20 amino acid. The transgenic genes should also be able to be denatured by heat in order for human consumption.

==Development==
The first commercially grown genetically modified [[Whole foods|whole food]] crop was a tomato (called [[FlavrSavr]]), which was modified to ripen without softening, by [[Calgene]], later a subsidiary of [[Monsanto]].<ref name="Martineau">{{Cite book|last =Martineau|first =Belinda |title =First Fruit: The Creation of the Flavr Savr Tomato and the Birth of Biotech Foods|publisher =McGraw-Hill| year =2001|page =269|isbn =978-0-07-136056-2}}</ref> Calgene took the initiative to obtain FDA approval for its release in 1994 without any special labeling, although legally no such approval was required.<ref>[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/biotech.html FDA Consumer Letter (September 1994): First Biotech Tomato Marketed]</ref> It was welcomed by consumers who purchased them at a substantial premium over the price of regular tomatoes. However, production problems<ref name="Martineau" /> and competition from a conventionally bred, longer [[Shelf life|shelf-life]] variety prevented the product from becoming profitable. A tomato produced using similar technology to the Flavr Savr was used by Zeneca to produce [[tomato paste]] which was sold in Europe during the summer of 1996.<ref>[http://www.geo-pie.cornell.edu/crops/tomato.html GEO-PIE Project <U+2013> Cornell University]</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Center for Environmental Risk Assessment|title=GM Crop Database:Tomato|publisher=International Life Sciences Institute|url=http://cera-gmc.org/index.php?evidcode=&hstIDXCode=11&gType=&AbbrCode=&atCode=&stCode=&coIDCode=&action=gm_crop_database&mode=Submit}}</ref> The labeling and pricing were designed as a marketing experiment, which proved, at the time, that European consumers would accept genetically engineered foods.

==History==  
The beginning of genetically modified foods can be traced back to the 1980s when scientists discovered that pieces of DNA can transfer between organisms.  The first genetically modified plant was produced a short time later, in 1983 using an antibiotic resistant tobacco plant.  In 1994, the tomato was genetically modified for human consumption.  This genetic modification allowed the tomato to delay ripening after picking.  Afterwards in 1995, a biotech company [[Monsanto]] introduced herbicide immune soybean also known as the Roundup ready. Also in 1995, the Bt Potato was approved safe by the Environmental Protection Agency, making it the first pesticide producing crop to be approved in the USA. In 1996, the first genetically modified Canola was available on the market. In the year 2000, scientist discovered that they were able to genetically modify foods to increase their nutrient value.  In the year 2005, Alfafa began being marketed in the USA. As of 2011, the U.S. leads a list of multiple countries in the production of GM crops. <ref>http://www.globalchange.umich.edu/globalchange2/current/workspace/sect008/s8g5/history.htm.History of Genetically Modified Foods.</ref>

Although most GM crops are grown in [[North America]], in recent years there has been rapid growth in the area sown in [[Developing country|developing countries]]. A total of 29 countries worldwide grew GM crops in 2011 by approximately 16.7 million farmers and 50% of GM crops grown worldwide were grown in developing countries. For example, the largest increase in crop area planted to GM crops in 2011 was in Brazil (303,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> versus 254,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in 2010). There has also been rapid and continuing expansion of GM cotton varieties in India since 2002 (Cotton is a major source of vegetable cooking oil and [[Fodder|animal feed]]) with 106,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of GM cotton harvested in India in 2011.<ref name = ISAAA2010/> In 2011, countries that grew the most transgenic crops were the United States, Brazil, Argentina, India, Canada, China, Paraguay, Pakistan, South Africa, Uruguay, Bolivia, Australia, Philippines, Myanmar, Burkino Faso, Mexico and Spain.<ref name = ISAAA2010/>

In India, GM cotton yields in Andhra Pradesh were no better than non-GM cotton in 2002, the first year of commercial GM cotton planting. This was because there was a severe drought in Andhra Pradesh that year and the parental cotton plant used in the genetic engineered variant was not well suited to extreme drought.

The [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] has a lesser role in GM foods regulation in Canada. The agency regulates the environmental release of GM crops and animal feed made from GM foods. <ref>http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/genetically-modified-foods. Genetically Modified Food.  </ref>

===U.S. Regulations===
In 1986 it was determined that there was no need to make new laws to regulate genetically modified food.  This policy stated, <U+201C>A commercial product, regardless of its manner of production, should be regulated based on the product<U+2019>s composition and its intended use.<U+201D>  This just means that food should be regulated in the way that it has always been regulated.  Since the genetically modified foods are complex in production the means of regulation are very complex.  Three major agencies; the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), and the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) regulate the production and safety of genetically modified food. <ref>http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Food_and_Biotechnology/hhs_biotech_0901.pdf.

====Regulatory Agencies====
=====Food and Drug Administration=====
In the regulation of genetically modified food, the FDA plays a significant role. It's obligation is to ensure the safety of the food and drugs for animals and humans. Within this organization there are department that regulate different areas of GM food which include,the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).<ref>http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Food_and_Biotechnology/hhs_biotech_0901.pdf. Guide to U.S. Regulation of Genetically Modified Food and Agricultural Biotechnology Products.Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology. September 2001. </ref>

=====Environmental Protection Agency=====
The major role of the EPA in the regulation of Genetically modified food is to govern the use of pesticides.  This includes all of the testing of any pesticide used. This also consist of pesticide residues in food,non-pesticides potential toxicities, and potentially dangerous microorganisms.<ref>http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Food_and_Biotechnology/hhs_biotech_0901.pdf. Guide to U.S. Regulation of Genetically Modified Food and Agricultural Biotechnology Products.Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology. September 2001. </ref>
=====United States Department of Agriculture=====
The USDA's role in the regulation of GM foods is to ensure the safety of meat, poultry, eggs, and related products.  Under the scope of these obligations includes the things that these animal eat; controlling plant pest and toxic weeds. A Department within the USDA that also is responsible for GM foods includes the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) which is responsible for biotechnology regulations. <ref>http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Food_and_Biotechnology/hhs_biotech_0901.pdf. Guide to U.S. Regulation of Genetically Modified Food and Agricultural Biotechnology Products.Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology. September 2001. </ref>

====Laws====
There are several laws that govern these regulatory agencies. These laws are statutes that these agencies review when determining the safety of a particular GM food. These laws include:<ref>http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Food_and_Biotechnology/hhs_biotech_0901.pdf.

However research published in Science in 2003 has shown that the use of genetically modified Bt cotton in India increased yields by 60% over the period 1998<U+2013>2001 while the number of applications of insecticides against bollworm were three times less on average.<ref>{{Cite journal

A 2008 Soil Association report found that some scientific studies claimed that genetically modified varieties of plants do not produce higher [[crop yield]]s than normal plants.<ref>[http://92.52.112.178/web/sa/saweb.nsf/195e597ae6f23abc80256ada0051a50f/3cacfd251aab6d318025742700407f02?OpenDocument Press Releases 2008]. 92.52.112.178.

In 2009 the Union of Concerned Scientists summarized numerous peer-reviewed studies on the yield contribution of genetic engineering in the United States. This report examined the two most widely grown engineered crops<U+2014>soybeans and maize (corn).<ref>D. Gurian-Sherman. 2009. Failure to Yield. [http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/failure-to-yield.pdf UCSUSA.org]</ref> Unlike many other studies, this work separated the yield contribution of the engineered gene from that of the many naturally occurring yield genes in crops.

The report found that engineered herbicide tolerant soy and maize did not increase yield at the national, aggregate level. Maize engineered with Bt insect resistance genes increased national yield by about 3 to 4 percent. Engineered crops increased [[net (economics)|net]] yield in all cases.

The study concluded that in the United States, other agricultural methods have made a much greater contribution to national crop yield increases in recent years than genetic engineering. United States Department of Agriculture data record maize yield increases of about 28 percent since engineered varieties were first commercialized in the mid 1990s. The yield contribution of engineered genes has therefore been a modest fraction<U+2014>about 14 percent<U+2014>of the maize yield increase since the mid 1990s.

A 2010 article supported by [[CropLife International]] summarised the results of 49 peer reviewed studies on GM crops worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carpenter|first1=Janet E|title=Peer-reviewed surveys indicate positive impact of commercialized GM crops|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=28|issue=4|page=319|year=2010|pmid=20379171|doi=10.1038/nbt0410-319|pages=319<U+2013>21}}</ref><ref>Carpenter, Janet (2010) [http://www.ask-force.org/web/Benefits/Carpenter-Peer-Reviewed-Surveys-2010.ppt Peer-reviewed surveys indicate positive impact of commercialized GM crops] Slide presentation of article in Nature Biotechnology, 28, 319 <U+2013> 321 (2010).

==Coexistence and traceability==
The United States and Canada do not require labeling of genetically modified foods.<ref>Trade barriers seen in EU label for bio-engineered ingredients. (Regulatory and Policy Trends). Business and the Environment 13.11 (Nov 2002): p14(1).</ref> However in certain other regions, such as the European Union, Japan, Malaysia and Australia, governments have required labeling so consumers can exercise choice between foods that have genetically modified, conventional or organic origins.<ref name="Northwestern">[http://www.law.northwestern.edu/journals/njtip/v5/n1/8/ Northwestern.edu] Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property Paper on: "Consumer Protection" Consumer Strategies and the European Market in Genetically Modified Foods Quote: ''The recent [[Trans Atlantic Consumer Dialogue]] (TACD) Statement on the WTO decision makes this clear: "clearly consumers' preference for non-GM food is the true engine of the market collapse for American crops."'' and '' For instance, Evenson notes that the politicization of GMOs is not merely a question of labeling as information, but unlabeled GM products as catalysts in the "globalization backlash."''</ref><ref name="CBC">[http://archives.cbc.ca/400d.asp?id=1-75-1597-10956&wm6=1 CBC] Identifying genetically modified products.

Canada's leading national consumer group does not support mandatory labeling. It appeared to reverse its stance on December 3, 2003: [http://www.consumer.ca/1626 Consumer.ca]''</ref> This requires a labeling system as well as the reliable separation of GM and non-GM organisms at production level and throughout the whole processing chain.<ref name="Northwestern" /><ref name="CBC" />

For [[Traceability of genetically modified organisms|traceability]], the OECD has introduced a "unique identifier" which is given to any GMO when it is approved.<ref>[http://www2.oecd.org/biotech/default.aspx BioTrack Product Database] OECD . Retrieved 11 October 2010.</ref> This [[unique identifier]] must be forwarded at every stage of processing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Many countries have established labeling regulations and guidelines on coexistence and traceability. Research projects such as [[Co-Extra]], SIGMEA and Transcontainer are aimed at investigating improved methods for ensuring coexistence and providing stakeholders the tools required for the implementation of coexistence and traceability.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Detection===
Testing on GMOs in food and feed is routinely done using molecular techniques like [[DNA microarrays]] or [[qPCR]]. These tests can be based on screening genetic elements (like p35S, tNos, pat, or bar) or event-specific markers for the official GMOs (like Mon810, Bt11, or GT73).
The array-based method combines [[multiplex (assay)|multiplex]] PCR and array technology to screen samples for different potential GMOs,<ref>[http://bgmo.jrc.ec.europa.eu/home/docs.htm BGMO.jrc.ec.europa.eu]</ref> combining different approaches (screening elements, plant-specific markers, and event-specific markers).

The qPCR is used to detect specific GMO events by usage of specific [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]] for screening elements or event-specific markers. Controls are necessary to avoid false positive or false negative results. For example, a test for [[CaMV]] is used to avoid a false positive in the event of a virus contaminated sample.

===PLU codes===
A 5-digit [[Price Look-Up code]] beginning with the digit ''8'' indicates genetically modified food.<ref>[http://plucodes.com/ Plucodes.com]</ref> However the absence of the "8" does not necessarily indicate the food is not genetically modified since no retailer to date has elected to use the digit in voluntarily labeling genetically modified foods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-smith/plu-codes-do-not-indicate_b_473088.html |title=Jeffrey Smith: PLU Codes Do Not Indicate Genetically Modified Produce |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-07}}</ref>

==Controversy==
{{Main|GM food controversy}}

To combat the controversy, in May of 2000, the Clinton administration<U+2019>s Council on Environmental Quality and the Office of Science and Technology established a committee. This committee was set up to conduct a six month investigation into the safety of the foods and to make sure that all federal regulations were upheld. After the investigation the committee was to report and if necessary make suggestions in order to improve the process. After the six months were up, lots of research was done but no improvements were suggested. <ref>[http://www.dlapiper.com/files/Publication/c7b0488e-39b7-4317-b7b4-ca8841bc8b6e/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/8aa5486e-82fa-460d-80ba-d03f5fefe7ea/Egan_NLJ_article_Jun01.pdf-Genetically Modified Foods raise new legal issues].</ref>

In March 2011 a coalition of family farmers, consumers and other critics of corporate agriculture held a town meeting to protest what they see as unfair consolidation of the nation's food system into the hands of a few multinationals. They contend that global biotech seed leader Monsanto controls the U.S. commercial seed market using unfair, and in some cases illegal, practices. They argue that Monsanto, which develops, licenses and markets genetically altered corn, soybeans and other crops, manipulates the seed market by buying up independent seed companies, patenting seed products, and then spiking prices. The group hopes to re-establish farmer rights to save seed from their harvested crops and replant it.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/03/12/us-seeds-antitrust-idUSTRE62B0A720100312 Reuters.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.grist.org/article/seedy-tactics-in-iowa-and-norway GRIST.org]</ref>

In recent years, [[France]] and several other European countries banned [[Monsanto]]'s MON-810 corn and similar genetically modified food crops. In late 2007, the U.S. [[ambassador]] to France recommended "moving to retaliation" against France and the European Union in an attempt to fight the French ban and changes in European policy toward genetically modified crops, according to a U.S. government [[diplomatic cable]] obtained by [[WikiLeaks]]. The U.S. ambassador to France recommended retaliation to cause "some pain across the EU."<ref name="Monsanto_US_retaliation">{{cite web| last =Ludwig| first =Mike| title =WikiLeaks: US Ambassador Planned "Retaliation" Against France Over Ban on Monsanto Corn|publisher =[[Truthout]]| date =2010-12-21| url =http://www.truth-out.org/wikileaks-us-ambassador-planned-retaliation-against-france-over-ban-monsanto-corn66131 | accessdate =2011-01-11 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vfAf0JwR |archivedate=2011-01-11}}</ref><ref name="07PARIS4723">{{Cite document| last =Stapleton| first =Craig| authorlink =Craig Roberts Stapleton|title =France and the WTO ag biotech case |id={{cablegate|07PARIS4723}}|publisher =[[WikiLeaks]]| date =2007-12-14| url =http://wikileaks.ch/cable/2007/12/07PARIS4723.html | accessdate =2010-12-26 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vGt2qyoP |archivedate=2010-12-26|deadurl=no }}</ref>

==Intellectual property==
Traditionally, farmers in all nations saved their own seed from year to year. It should be noted that this does not apply in more agriculturally developed countries for some crops. Corn is one example where producers generally have not saved seed since the early 1900s with the advent of hybrid corn through selective breeding. Seed producers grow the seed corn instead due to the effort needed to produce hybrids.<ref name="test">[http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/timeline/corn.htm Agricultural Research Service: Improving Corn].</ref> The offspring of the hybrid corn, while still viable, lose the beneficial traits of the parents, resulting in the loss of [[Heterosis|hybrid vigor]]. In these cases, the use of hybrid plants has been the primary reason for growers not saving seed, not intellectual property issues, and has been in practice well before genetically-modified seed was developed. However, the practice of not saving seed in non-hybrid crops, such as soybean, is mainly due to intellectual property regulations. Allowing to follow this practice with genetically modified seed would result in seed developers losing the ability to profit from their breeding work. Therefore, genetically-modified seed is subject to licensing by their developers in contracts that are written to prevent farmers from following this practice.<ref>United States General Accounting Office, Report to the Chairman, Subcommittee on Risk Management, Research, and Specialty Crops, Committee on Agriculture, House of Representatives.

{{Main|Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser}}

Enforcement of [[patent]]s on genetically modified plants is often contentious, especially because of [[gene flow]]. In 1998, 95<U+2013>98 percent of about 10&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> planted with canola by [[Canada|Canadian]] farmer [[Percy Schmeiser]] were found to contain [[Monsanto Company]]'s patented [[Roundup Ready]] gene although Schmeiser had never purchased seed from Monsanto.<ref name="Munzer">{{Cite journal

}}</ref> The initial source of the plants was undetermined, and could have been through either gene flow or intentional theft. However, the overwhelming predominance of the trait implied that Schmeiser must have intentionally selected for it. The court found that Schmeiser had saved seed from areas on and adjacent to his property where Roundup had been sprayed, such as ditches and near power poles.<ref name="trial">Federal [[Court system of Canada|court of Canada]].

Although unable to prove direct theft, Monsanto sued Schmeiser for piracy since he knowingly grew ''Roundup Ready'' plants without paying royalties (Ibid). The case made it to the Canadian Supreme Court, which in 2004 ruled 5 to 4 in Monsanto<U+2019>s favor.<ref name="Munzer" /><ref name="trial" /> The dissenting judges focused primarily on the fact that Monsanto's patents covered only the gene itself and glyphosate resistant ''cells'', and failed to cover transgenic plants in their entirety. All of the judges agreed that Schmeiser would not have to pay any damages since he had not benefited from his use of the genetically modified seed.

In response to criticism, Monsanto Canada's Director of Public Affairs stated that "It is not, nor has it ever been Monsanto Canada's policy to enforce its patent on Roundup Ready crops when they are present on a farmer's field by accident...Only when there has been a knowing and deliberate violation of its patent rights will Monsanto act."<ref name="Schubert">Schubert, Robert: "Schmeiser Wants to Take It to The Supreme Court", CropChoice News, September 9, 2002</ref>

==Health risks==
In the United States, the FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition reviews summaries of food safety data developed and voluntarily submitted by developers of engineered foods, in part on the basis of comparability to conventionally-produced foods. There are no specific tests required by FDA to determine safety. FDA does not approve the safety of engineered foods{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}, but after its review, acknowledges that the developer of the food has asserted that it is safe. The table below shows the foods that have been reviewed by FDA as of 2002.<ref>[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d02566.pdf US GAO], "Genetically Modified Foods: Experts View Regimen of Safety Tests as Adequate, but FDA's Evaluation Process Could Be Enhanced."

Worldwide, there are a range of perspectives within non-governmental organizations on the safety of GM foods. For example, the US pro-GM pressure group AgBioWorld has argued that GM foods have been proven safe,<ref>[http://www.agbioworld.org/biotech-info/articles/biotech-art/peer-reviewed-pubs.html Peer Reviewed Publications on the Safety of GM Foods]. AgBioWorld.</ref> while other pressure groups and consumer rights groups, such as the [[Organic Consumers Association]],<ref>[http://www.organicconsumers.org/ Organic Consumers Association]</ref> and [[Greenpeace]]<ref>[http://www.truefoodnow.org/ True Food Now!]</ref> claim the long term health risks which GM could pose, or the environmental risks associated with GM, have not yet been adequately investigated.

===Gene transfer===
As of January 2009 there has only been one human feeding study conducted on the effects of genetically modified foods. The study involved seven human volunteers who had previously had their large intestines removed. These volunteers were to eat GM soy to see if the DNA of the GM soy transferred to the bacteria that naturally lives in the human gut. Researchers identified that three of the seven volunteers had transgenes from GM soya transferred into the bacteria living in their gut before the start of the feeding experiment. As this low-frequency transfer did not increase after the consumption of GM Soy, the researchers concluded that gene transfer did not occur during the experiment. In volunteers with complete digestive tracts, the transgene did not survive passage through intact gastrointestinal tract.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Netherwood|last2=Mart<U+FFFD>n-Or<U+FFFD>e|first2=Susana M|last3=O'Donnell|first3=Anthony G|last4=Gockling|first4=Sally|last5=Graham|first5=Julia|last6=Mathers|first6=John C|last7=Gilbert|first7=Harry J|title=Assessing the survival of transgenic plant DNA in the human gastrointestinal tract|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=22|issue=2|page=204|year=2004|pmid=14730317|doi=10.1038/nbt934|display-authors=1|pages=204<U+2013>9}}</ref> Anti-GM advocates believe the study should prompt additional testing to determine its significance.<ref>Smith, Jeffrey.

No testing has been done by the USDA or FDA to support that claim. In some European studies, the herbicide 'glyphosate' was found to be present in control groups of mice that were fed GM soy protein. Also, it was found that second and third generations of mice that were fed GM soy, had significant reproductive defects, compared to mice fed non GM soy. This information should be validated by additional studies conducted in the United States.

The amplification of RR soybean by PCR assays using event-specific primers was also achieved for all the extraction and refining steps, except for the intermediate steps of refining (neutralisation, washing and bleaching) possibly due to sample instability. The real-time PCR assays using specific probes confirmed all the results and proved that it is possible to detect and quantify genetically modified organisms in the fully refined soybean oil. To our knowledge, this has never been reported before and represents an important accomplishment regarding the traceability of genetically modified organisms in refined oils."

Genetically engineered animals are a powerful method of introducing desirable traits into animals using [recombinant DNA] technology by adding, changing or removing certain DNA sequences to modify the charachteristics of the animal. <ref name="EFSA"> EFSA (2012). Genetically modified aniamls. Europe: EFSA.http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/gmanimals.htm.</ref> The process of genetically engineering animals is a slow and tedious process that requires a large amount of funds. Thanks to new technologies being introduced, genetically modifying animals is becoming easier and more precise. This is not only transforming science, but could also transform the food we eat. <ref name="Murray">Murray, Joo (20). Genetically modified aniamls. Canada: Brainwaving.http://www.brainwaving.com/2010/07/28/genetically-modified-animals/.</ref>

The first transgenic (genetically modified animal), was produced by injecting DNA into eggs, implanting the eggs in animals and then waiting weeks or months to see if any offspring had incorporated the extra DNA. At first only about 10% performed correctly, in the end making this a long and expensive.<ref name="murray"/>

Genetically modified animals currently being developed can be placed into six different broad classes based on the intended purpose of the genetic modification: (1) to inhance production or food quality traits (faster growing fish, pigs that expel less toxins); (2) to improve animal health (disease resistance); (3) to produce products intended for human theraputic use (pharmacutical products or tissue for implantation); (4) to inrich or inhance the animals' interactions with humans (hypo-allerganic pets); (5) to deveolop animal models for human diseases (pigs as models for cardiovascular disease); (6) and to produce industrial or consumer products (fibers for multiple uses).  <ref name="rudenko">rudinko, larisa (20).

New traits can be introduced into animals. Here's how it works for animals engineered to produce a human pharmaceutical. Diagram to the right.

1. Generation of the DNA Construct

A. Milk Protein Promoter DNA: allows for expression only in goat mammary glands.

B. Therapeutic Protein Gene: encodes a protein known to treat disease in people.

C. Terminator Sequence: assures that only the gene of interest is controlled by A.

D. Other DNA Sequences: helps with the introduction of the new combination DNA strand.

2. The DNA construct is created by combining A, B, C and D.

3. This new DNA strand is then introduced by any of a number of methods into an animal cell, such as an egg, that is then used to produce a genetically engineered animal.

4. The first genetically engineered goat is produced.

5. The offspring of the first genetically engineered goats, referred to as production animals, are milked. The milk is transferred to a purification facility.

6. The drug to be used to treat human disease is purified from the goat's milk.

==Enviropig==
[[File:Enviropig.jpg|right|Phytase produced in the salivary glands and secreted in the saliva increases the digestion of phosphorus contained in feed grains]]

Enviropig is a genetically enhanced line of [[Yorkshire pig]]s created with the capability of digesting plant phosphorus more efficiently than conventional Yorkshire pigs.<ref name="Guelph"/> These pigs produce the enzyme phytase (breaks down the indigestible phosphorus) in the salivary glands that is secreted in the saliva. The enzyme [[phytase]] is introduced into the pig chromosome by pronuclear [microinjection]. With this enzyme, Enviropig is able to digest cereal grain [[phosphorus]], so there is then no need to supplement the pigs diet with either [[phosphate minerals]]or commercially produced phytase, yielding less phosphorus in the manure.<ref name="Guelph"> Guelph(2010). Enviropig. Canada: http://www.uoguelph.ca/enviropig/index.shtml/.</ref>


Enviropig has beneficial attributes; it reduces feeds costs because farmers are not required to purchase special feed for their pigs which include the phytase, and reduces the potential of water pollution.<ref name="Guelph"/> High concentrations of phosphorus in water streams cause an outbreak in algal growth, because phosphorus is the major nutrient which enables algal to grow.<ref name="Guelph"/> The increase in [[algal]] population decreases the amount of oxygen in the waters resulting in dead zones for fish because the algal depletes the waters oxygen. This would not only be advantageous for the waters surrounding the pigs, but also for the water neighboring the areas which use the [[manure]] for fertilizers. 

As of now, there are not regulations or pending approvals on the Enviropig for human consumption according to the FDA.org website.


==Other Genetically Modified Animals Examples==
'''Cows with human genes'''
In 2011, Chinese scientist have been breeding cows genetically engineered with genes for human beings to produce milk that would be the same as human breast milk.<ref name="stevenson"> stevenson, heidi(2011). Scientists Use Human Genes in Animals, So Cows Produce Human-Like Milk<U+2014>Or Do They? USA:http://www.gaia-health.com/articles401/000433-human-genes-cows-produce-human-milk.shtml/.</ref> This would possible be beneficial for the mothers who cannot produce breast milk but want their children to receive the benefits from breast milk rather than formula.

'''Goats that produce silk in their milk'''
A company called biosteel has genetically engineered goats to produce milk with strong spider web like silk proteins in their milk.<ref name="zyga">zyga, lisa(2010). Sicentist bread goats that produce spider silk. USA:http://phys.org/news194539934.html/.</ref> This product is not used for consumption, but to make bulletproof vest and anti-ballistic missile systems for military contracts instead.<ref name="zyga"/>


'''Pigs that glow in the dark'''
In 2006 Taiwan scientist used genetic material from a jelly fish and implanted it into pigs embryos.<ref name="Hogg"> Hogg, Chriss(2005). Taiwan Breeds Green-Glowing Pigs. USA:http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/End%20of%20the%20World/Genetics%20Nightmare/glowing_pigs.htm/.</ref> The result was that depicted to the right, pigs that glow bright green in the dark. The pigs whole body including its internal organs glow green. In the daylight, these pigs have a slight tinge of green on their skin, snout and teeth.<ref name="hubpages"/>
