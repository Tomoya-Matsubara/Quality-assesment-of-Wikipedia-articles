'''Garnet Francis Malley''', [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|AFC]] (2 November 1892&nbsp;<U+2013> 20 May 1961) was an Australian [[flying ace|fighter ace]] of World War&nbsp;I, credited with six aerial victories. He was an aviation adviser to [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s government in China during the 1930s, and an intelligence officer in World War&nbsp;II.

Born and educated in [[New South Wales]], Malley first saw service in World War&nbsp;I as an artilleryman with the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]]. He transferred to the [[Australian Flying Corps]] in 1917, and the following year flew [[Sopwith Camel]]s with [[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;4 Squadron]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Malley was awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his achievements in combat, and his subsequent work as a flying instructor in England earned him the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]]. After a spell in civilian life following the war, he joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) in 1925, serving with [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;3 Squadron]]. He became an aviation adviser to China in 1931, and worked closely with [[Soong May-ling|Madame Chiang Kai-shek]] from 1937. Malley was able to observe air tactics in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] at first hand, though his reports were given little weight in Australia. Returning home in 1940, he served in intelligence roles with the RAAF and later the Commonwealth government. After the war he bought a plantation in Fiji, where he died in 1961.

==Early life==
Garnet Malley was the penultimate of six children born to Clara Ellen Merritt and Francis Malley in [[Mosman, New South Wales|Mosman]], a suburb of [[Sydney]], on 2 November 1892. He attended the Church of England Preparatory School in Mosman, [[The School, Mount Victoria|The School]] in [[Mount Victoria, New South Wales|Mount Victoria]], and [[Hawkesbury Agricultural College]] in [[Richmond, New South Wales|Richmond]]. At the [[Military history of Australia during World War I|outbreak of World War&nbsp;I]] he was apprenticing as a mechanic in his father's whitegoods firm, Malley's Ltd, in Sydney.<ref name=ADB>{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Chris|title=Malley, Garnet Francis (1892<U+2013>1961)|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150344b.htm |work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher = Australian National University|location = Canberra|accessdate=20 February 2014}}</ref><ref name=APSC5>Coulthard-Clark, ''Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection'', p. 5</ref>

{{quote|Lt. (T./Capt.) Garnet Francis Malley, Aust. F.C., attd. R.F.C.

For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. When on offensive and low-flying patrol he attacked one of two hostile scouts, which eventually turned over and fell out of control, being seen to crash by another pilot. Later, a general engagement ensued with four enemy scouts, one of which he attacked, with the result that it fell completely out of control and crashed. Prior to this occasion he had also shot down out of control another hostile machine. His courage and able leadership have resulted in his patrol carrying out excellent work under the most adverse conditions.}}

Returning to Australia, Malley toured the country from August 1919 in support of the Peace Loan. He was discharged from the AIF on 4&nbsp;October, and rejoined the family firm as warehouse manager in 1921. On 25&nbsp;January 1922, he married Phyllis Kathleen Dare in Mosman.<ref name=ADB/> The union would produce one son, Maldon.<ref name="SMH-19400917">{{cite news|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=17 September 1940|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17700517 |title=Three years of air raids&nbsp;<U+2013> Sydney woman in China |accessdate=20 February 2014}}</ref> Malley was acknowledged as both a source and a reviewer by F.M.

On 19 June 1925, Malley was commissioned as a [[flight lieutenant]] in the part-time Citizen Air Force, serving as a pilot with [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;3 Squadron]], which operated [[Airco DH.9]]s and [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]]s. Formed at [[RAAF Williams|RAAF Point Cook]], Victoria, the squadron transferred to the newly opened [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Richmond]], New South Wales, on 30&nbsp;June.<ref name=APSC10>Coulthard-Clark, ''Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection'', p. 10</ref><ref name=Roylance123>Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p. 123</ref> From 1925 to 1928, Malley was vice president of the Australian Flying Corps Association.

By 1931, ANA was in financial difficulties and Malley travelled to China to take up a position as an aviation adviser to the Chinese government in [[Guangdong|Kwangtung]].<ref name=Third243/> On 1&nbsp;February 1937, through the influence of the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]], Malley's status was bolstered by his appointment as an honorary [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] in the RAAF Reserve. He was by this time serving as adviser to [[Soong May-ling|Madame Chiang Kai-shek]] in her capacity as secretary-general of the aeronautical commission that directed China's air force; Madame Chiang extended to Malley her "warmest congratulations" for his "well deserved" promotion.<ref name=APSC13>Coulthard-Clark, ''Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection'', p. 13</ref> One of the tasks she assigned him was investigating corrupt procurement practices in the air force.<ref>Tyson Li, ''Madame Chiang Kai-Shek'', pp. 134<U+2013>135</ref> Malley's stay increasingly involved him in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|fighting in China]]; his wife would relate three years of night-time air raids to her friends upon the couple's return to Australia in 1940.<ref name="SMH-19400917" /> Some members of the RAAF, however, including the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], Air Vice-Marshal [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]], may have perceived Malley as exaggerating the importance of his role with the Chinese, particularly given his apparent delight in its ceremonial aspects. At any rate, his reports of Japanese air tactics during 1938, and the value his observations might have held for Australia in the event of war in the Pacific, were largely discounted by his home government.<ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 448<U+2013>450</ref><ref name=APSC15>Coulthard-Clark, ''Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection'', pp. 15<U+2013>17</ref>

Malley was recalled to Australia in July 1940.<ref name=APSC17>Coulthard-Clark, ''Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection'', pp. 17<U+2013>18</ref> He rejoined the RAAF as a squadron leader in October, and took up the position of Deputy Director of the Combined Operational Intelligence Centre (COIC).<ref name=ADB/> Drawing on his knowledge of Japanese raids on Chinese airfields in the 1930s, Malley visited several RAAF stations in northern Australia to advise on protective measures; it became evident in the wake of the [[Bombing of Darwin|attack on Darwin]] in February 1942 that none of his recommendations had been implemented.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/admin/productfiles/publication/materials/476/pathfinder_171_feb12small.pdf|title=The bombing of Darwin 19 February 1942&nbsp;<U+2013> the RAAF experience|work=Pathfinder|date=February 2012|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|location=Canberra|accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref><ref name=APSC18>Coulthard-Clark, ''Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection'', p. 18</ref> He was promoted to honorary wing commander in October 1941, and two months later succeeded [[Rupert Long]] as Director of COIC.<ref name=ADB/> Malley was raised to acting [[group captain]] on 1&nbsp;July 1942, but ill health forced him to relinquish his post on 3&nbsp;October.<ref name=ADB/><ref name=APSC17/> He was discharged from the Air Force as medically unfit on 9&nbsp;June 1943.<ref name=APSC17/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?ServiceId=R&VeteranId=1056413|title=Malley, Garnet Francis|work=World War Two Nominal Roll|accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref> General [[Douglas MacArthur]] praised Malley for his "foresight, planning, and organizational ability".<ref name=ADB/> He went on to work as officer-in-charge of the Chinese section at the Commonwealth Security Service in [[Canberra]] from January 1944 to March 1947 as an honorary group captain.<ref name=ADB/><ref name=APSC19>Coulthard-Clark, ''Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection'', p. 19</ref>

In 1948, Malley's war service was recognised by the United States with the award of the [[Legion of Merit]].
