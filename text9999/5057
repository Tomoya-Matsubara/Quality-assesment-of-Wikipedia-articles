'''Alexander "Sasha" Shulgin''' (born June 17, 1925 in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]]) is a [[Russian-American]] [[pharmacologist]], [[chemist]] and [[psychoactive drug|drug]] developer.

Shulgin is credited with the popularization of [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s, especially for [[psychopharmacology|psychopharmaceutical]] use and the treatment of depression and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. In subsequent years, Shulgin discovered, synthesized, and [[bioassay]]ed over 230 psychoactive compounds. In 1991 and 1997, he and his wife [[Ann Shulgin]] authored the books ''[[PiHKAL]]'' and ''[[TiHKAL]]'' on the topic of [[psychoactive drugs]]. Shulgin discovered many noteworthy [[phenethylamines]] including the [[2C* family]] of which [[2C-T-2]], [[2C-T-7]], [[2C-E]], [[2C-I]], and [[2C-B]] are most well known. Additionally, Shulgin performed seminal work into the descriptive synthesis of compounds based on the organic compound [[tryptamine]].

He is currently continuing his work at home in [[Lafayette, California]], and is writing a new comprehensive psychedelic drug index.{{Fact|date=April 2009}}

==Early life and career==

Shulgin began studying organic chemistry as a [[Harvard University]] scholarship student. In 1943, at the age of 19, he dropped out of school, and joined the [[U.S. Navy]], where he eventually became interested in [[pharmacology]].<ref name="nyt">

Through the late 50's, Shulgin completed post-doctoral work in the fields of [[psychiatry]] and [[pharmacology]] at [[University of California, San Francisco]]. After working at [[Bio-Rad|Bio-Rad Laboratories]] as a research director for a brief period, he began work at [[Dow Chemical Company]] as a senior research chemist.<ref name="nyt" />

It was at this time that he had a series of psychedelic experiences that helped to shape his further goals and research, beginning with an experience with [[mescaline]].<ref name="lat">

{{quotation|I first explored mescaline in the late '50s, Three-hundred-fifty to 400 milligrams. I learned there was a great deal inside me.|Alexander Shulgin|[[LA Times]], 1995<ref name="lat"/>}}

He would later write that everything he saw and thought "had been brought about by a fraction of a gram of a white solid, but that in no way whatsoever could it be argued that these memories had been contained within the white solid... I understood that our entire universe is contained in the mind and the spirit. We may choose not to find access to it, we may even deny its existence, but it is indeed there inside us, and there are chemicals that can catalyze its availability."<ref name="nyt"/>

Shulgin's professional activities continued to lean in the direction of psychopharmacology, furthered by his personal experiences with psychedelics.  But during this period he was unable to do much independent research. His opportunity for further research came with his development of [[mexacarbate|Zectran]], the first biodegradable pesticide, a highly profitable product. Dow Chemical Company, in return for Zectran's valuable patent, gave Shulgin great freedom. During this time, he created and patented drugs when Dow asked, and published findings on other drugs in journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Journal of Organic Chemistry]]''. Eventually, Dow Chemical requested that he no longer use their name on his publications.<ref name="nyt" />

In 1965, Shulgin left Dow to pursue his own interests, and became a private consultant, also frequently teaching classes in the local universities and at the [[San Francisco General Hospital]]. Through his friend Bob Sager, head of the U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Agency|DEA]]'s Western Laboratories, Shulgin formed a relationship with the DEA and began holding pharmacology seminars for the agents, supplying the DEA with samples of various compounds, and occasionally serving as an expert witness in court. He also authored a definitive law enforcement reference book<ref>

==Independent research==

In order to carry out consulting work with the DEA, Shulgin obtained a DEA [[Controlled Substances Act|Schedule I]] license for an analytical laboratory, which allowed him to possess and synthesize any otherwise illicit drug. Shulgin set up a chemical synthesis laboratory in a small building behind his house, which gave him a great deal of career autonomy. Shulgin used this freedom to synthesize and test the effects of [[psychoactive drug]]s.

In 1967, Shulgin was introduced to [[MDMA]] (ecstasy) by Merrie Kleinman, a graduate student in the medicinal chemistry group he advised at San Francisco State University. [[MDMA]] had been synthesized in 1912 by [[Merck KGaA|Merck]] and patented in 1914 as a byproduct of another synthesis, but was considered useless, and was never explored. Shulgin went on to develop a new synthesis method, and in 1976, introduced the chemical to [[Leo Zeff]], a [[psychologist]] from [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]]. Zeff used the substance in his practice in small doses as an aid to talk therapy. Zeff introduced the substance to hundreds of psychologists around the nation, including [[Ann Shulgin]], whom Alexander Shulgin met in 1979, and married in 1981.<ref name="nyt" />

After judicious self-experiments, Shulgin enlisted a small group of friends with whom he regularly tested his creations, starting in 1960. They developed a systematic way of ranking the effects of the various drugs, known as the [[Shulgin Rating Scale]], with a vocabulary to describe the visual, auditory and physical sensations. He personally tested hundreds of drugs, mainly analogues of various [[phenethylamine]]s (family containing [[ecstasy (drug)|MDMA]] and [[mescaline]]), and [[tryptamine]]s (family containing [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] and [[psilocybin]]). There are a seemingly infinite number of slight chemical variations, all of which produce variations in effect&mdash;some pleasant and some unpleasant, depending on the person, substance, and situation&mdash;all of which are meticulously recorded in Shulgin's lab notebooks. Shulgin published many of these objective and subjective reports in his books and papers.<ref name="nyt" />

In 1994, two years after the publication of ''[[PiHKAL]]'', the DEA raided his lab; allegedly finding problems with his record keeping, the agency requested that Shulgin turn over his license for violating the license's terms, and he was fined $25,000 for possession of anonymous samples sent to him for quality testing. In the 15 years preceding the publication of PiHKAL, two announced and scheduled reviews failed to find any irregularities.<ref>

Agents tell me that in clandestine labs that they have raided, they have found copies of those books,"<ref name="nyt" /> suggesting to many that the publication of ''PiHKAL'' and the termination of Shulgin's license were related.

On April 8th, 2008, the 82 year old Dr. Shulgin underwent surgery to replace a defective [[aortic valve]].<ref name="urlMAPS News 6/19/08">{{cite web |url=http://www.maps.org/sys/nq.pl?id=1610&fmt=stdnews |title=MAPS News 6/19/08 |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>
