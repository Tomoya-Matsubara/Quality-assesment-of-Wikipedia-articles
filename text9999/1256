'''Milton Friedman''' ([[July 31]] [[1912]] &ndash; [[November 16]] [[2006]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[economist]] and [[public intellectual]] who made major contributions to the fields of [[macroeconomics]], [[microeconomics]], [[economic history]] and [[statistics]] while advocating [[laissez-faire capitalism]]. In [[1976]], he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] for his achievements in the fields of consumption analysis, [[money supply|monetary]] history and theory and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/economics/laureates/1976/index.html Nobel Laureates for 1976] at [http://www.nobelprize.org http://www.nobelprize.org], accessed 20 November 2006.</ref>

According to ''[[The Economist]]'', Friedman "was the most influential economist of the second half of the 20th century<U+2026>possibly of all of it." <ref>[http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8313925 ''Milton Friedman, a giant among economists''] from [[The Economist]].</ref> In the [[Public Broadcasting System|PBS]] biography, [http://www.freetochoosemedia.org The Power of Choice], [[Alan Greenspan]] stated "There are very few people over the generations who have ideas that are sufficiently original to materially alter the direction of civilization. Milton is one of those very few people." <ref>[http://www.freetochoosemedia.org ''The Power of Choice''] from [http://www.freetochoosemedia.org Free to Choose Media].</ref> In his 1962 book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', Friedman advocated minimizing the role of government in a [[free market]] as a means of creating political and social freedom.  In his [[1980]] television series ''[[Free to Choose]]'', which aired on PBS, Friedman explained how the free market works, emphasizing that its principles have shown to solve social and political problems that other systems have failed to address adequately. ''Free to Choose'' was later released as a book, co-authored with his wife, [[Rose Friedman]].  The book was widely read, as were his columns for ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine. His writings were circulated underground behind the Iron Curtain before it fell in 1989. <ref> Holcomb B. Noble, "Milton Friedman, a Leading Economist, Dies at 94, ''New York Times" November 16, 2006, obituary.</ref>

Starting as a [[Keynesian]] supporter of the [[New Deal]], Friedman moved to the ''right'' in the 1950s when his advocacy of free markets was a minority view among economists during the "big government", high taxation, high regulation, [[welfare state]] era.  His political philosophy, which Friedman himself considered [[Classical liberalism|classically liberal]], stressed the advantages of the marketplace and the disadvantages of government intervention, shaping the outlook of [[American conservatives]] and [[libertarians]]. He adamantly argued that if capitalism, or [[economic freedom]], is introduced into countries governed by totalitarian regimes that [[political freedom]] would tend to result. He lived to see his [[laissez-faire]] ideas embraced by the mainstream,<ref>Washington Times. Thursday, November 16, 2006.

Patrica Sullivan and Carlos Lozada</ref> especially during the 1980s, a watershed decade for the acceptance of Friedman's ideas. His views of monetary policy, taxation, privatization and deregulation informed the policy of governments around the globe, especially the administrations of [[Ronald Reagan]] in the [[United States]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. His ideas were studied throughout the world, and played a major role in the transformation of China's economy.

[[29 January]] [[2007]] has been declared ''Milton Friedman Day'' by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Governor of California]], to honor his life, works, and achievements, as well as his influence on modern economic and governmental policy.<ref>[http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2007/1/30/miltonFriedmanDayMarked "'Milton Friedman Day' marked"] by James Hohmann, in ''The Stanford Daily'' ([[30 January]] [[2007]]), accessed [[30 January]] [[2007]].</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life and education, 1912-35===
Friedman was born on July 31, 1912 in [[the Bronx]] to a working family of [[Jew]]ish immigrants from [[Austria-Hungary]], more specifically from Bergsa<U+00DF>/Beregsz<U+00E1>sz ([[Berehove]]) in modern [[Ukraine]]. He was the fourth and last child, and first son, of S<U+00E1>ra Eszter Landau (1892-?) and Jen<U+0151> Saul Friedman.<ref>Hermann, P<U+00E9>ter ed. Biogr<U+00E1>f Ki kicsoda 2004. [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], [[2003]]</ref>, both of whom worked as [[dry goods]] [[merchants]].  Shortly after Milton's birth, the family relocated to [[Rahway, New Jersey]].  A gifted student, Friedman graduated from [[Rahway Public Schools|Rahway High School]] in 1928, shortly before his 16th birthday.

Friedman was educated at [[Rutgers University]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], 1932).  (As his father had died in 1928, Friedman had to pay his own way through university.)  He specialized in [[Mathematics]], and initially intended to become an [[actuary]] but found the exams cumbersome and quit.  During his time at Rutgers, Friedman fell under the influence of two economics professors, [[Arthur F. Burns]] and [http://research.stlouisfed.org/conferences/homer/homer.html Homer Jones].  At the height of the [[Great Depression]], they convinced him that the study of [[Economics]] could help to solve the ongoing economic difficulties, and he ended up graduating with the equivalent of a double major in Mathematics and Economics.

Upon his graduation from Rutgers, Friedman turned down an offer to study [[Applied Mathematics]] at [[Brown University]], instead accepting a scholarship to study Economics at the [[University of Chicago]] ([[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]], 1933).  During this year in [[Chicago]], Friedman's intellectual development was strongly influenced by [[Jacob Viner]], [[Frank Knight]], and [[Henry Simons]].  It was also during this time at Chicago that Friedman met his future wife, Rose Director (sister of prominent law professor [[Aaron Director]]).

After completing his master's degree, Friedman spent the next academic year (1933-34) on a postgraduate fellowhip at [[Columbia University]], where he studied [[statistics]] with renowned statistician Henry Hotelling.  

He was back in Chicago for 1934-35, spending the year working as a [[research assistant]] for [http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/schultz.htm Henry Schultz], who was then working on his ''Theory and Measurement of Demand''.  During this year, Friedman formed what would prove to be lifelong friendships with [[George Stigler]] and [[W. Allen Wallis]].

===Federal service, 1935-43===
Friedman was unable to find academic employment, so in 1935, he followed his friend W. Allen Wallis to [[Washington, D.C.]], where Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] was "a lifesaver" for many young economists.

At this stage, Friedman approved of "many early New Deal measures as appropriate responses to the critical situation", especially the job creating relief agencies [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]], [[Civilian Conservation Corps|CCC]], and [[Public Works Administration|PWA]]<ref>Friedman, ''Two Lucky People'', p 59</ref>. However, he generally disapproved of government programs, especially [[price controls]] that interfered with what he considered an essential signaling mechanism to help resources go where they are most valued.  Later, in <i>Monetary History of the United States<i> he would argue that the [[Great Depression]] was not caused by Federal Reserve actions but could have been alleviated by Fed policies before 1933 to expand the money supply. 

In 1935, he began work at the National Resources Committee which was then working on a large consumer budget survey.  Ideas from this project later became a part of his ''Theory of the Consumption Function''.

In fall 1937, Friedman moved to the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] to assist [[Simon Kuznets]] in his work on professional income.  This work led to their jointly-authored ''Incomes from Independent Professional Practice'', which introduced the concepts of permanent and transitory income, which were a major component of the [[Permanent Income Hypothesis]] which Friedman worked out in greater detail in the 1950s.  The book hypothesizes that professional licensing artificially restricts the supply of services and raises prices.  In 1945, Friedman submitted this book (completed in 1940) to Columbia University as his doctoral dissertation.

In 1940, Friedman was appointed an assistant professor teaching Economics at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], but encountered [[anti-Semitism]] in the Economics department and decided to return to government service.<ref>Friedman, ''Two Lucky People'', 42, 84-85.</ref>  

In 1941-43, he worked on wartime [[tax]] policy for the Federal Government, as an advisor to senior officials of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]].  As a Treasury spokesman in 1942 he advocated a [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] policy of [[taxation in the United States|taxation]], and during this time he helped to invent  the payroll [[withholding tax]] system.<ref>[http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:TBhKg7PonFAJ:www.ntu.org/main/press.php%3FPressID%3D256%26org_name%3DNTU+%22Milton+friedman%22+%22income+tax%22+treasury&hl=en National Taxpayers Union]</ref>

In his autobiography, he comments on "how thoroughly Keynesian I was then."<ref>Friedman, ''Two Lucky People'', p 113</ref> As Friedman grew older he reversed himself and in 2006 said, "You know, it's a mystery as to why people think [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]]'s policies pulled us out of the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. The problem was that you had unemployed machines and unemployed people. How do you get them together by forming industrial cartels and keeping prices and wages up?"<ref>Friedman, Milton. [http://www.rightwingnews.com/interviews/friedman.php ''Interview with John Hawkins''. Right Wing News.]</ref>

===Academic career, 1943-77===

In 1943, Friedman joined the Division of War Research at Columbia University (headed by W. Allen Wallis and Henry Hotelling), where he spent the rest of the war years working as a mathematical statistician, focusing on problems of [[weapons]] design, [[military tactics]], and [[metallurgical]] experiments.

As noted in the previous section, in 1945, Friedman submitted ''Incomes from Independent Professional Practice'' (co-authored with Kuznets and completed in 1940) to Columbia, which subsequently awarded him a [[Ph.D.]] in 1946.

Milton and Rose Friedman's son, [[David D. Friedman|David Director Friedman]] was born during their time at Columbia, on February 2, 1945.

Friedman spent the 1945-46 academic year teaching at the [[University of Minnesota]] (where his friend George Stigler was employed)

In 1946, Friedman accepted an offer to teach economic theory at the University of Chicago (a position opened by Jacob Viner's departure to [[Princeton University]]).  Friedman would stay at the University of Chicago for the next thirty years.  There he helped build a close-knit intellectual community that produced a number of Nobel Prize winners, known collectively as the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School of Economics]]. 

At the same time he moved to the University of Chicago, Arthur Burns, who was then the head of the National Bureau of Economic Research, asked Friedman to rejoin the Bureau's staff.  He accepted the invitation, and assumed responsibility for the Bureau's inquiry into the role of [[money]] in the [[business cycle]].  As a result, he founded the "Workshop in Money and Banking" (the "Chicago Workshop"), which led a revival in monetary studies.  During the latter half of the 1940s, Friedman began a collaboration with [[Anna Schwartz]], an [[Economic history|economic historian]] at the Bureau, which would ultimately result in the 1963 publication of a book co-authored by Friedman and Schwartz, ''A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960''.

Friedman spent the latter part of 1950 in [[Paris]], where he assisted the US administrators of the [[Marshall Plan]] in formulating their response to the [[Schuman Declaration]].  This led Friedman to the study of [[floating exchange rates]] which resulted in his ''The Case for Flexible Exchange Rates''.

Friedman spent the 1954-55 academic year as a Visiting Fellow at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]]. At the time, the Cambridge economics faculty was deeply divided into a [[Keynesian]] majority (including [[Joan Robinson]] and [[Richard Kahn]]) and a virulently anti-Keynesian minority (headed by [[Dennis Robertson]]). Friedman speculates that he was invited to the fellowship because his extreme [[laissez-faire]] views were unacceptable to both of the Cambridge factions, a fact which highlights how far out of the mainstream Friedman was in the 1950s.

In 1962, in his first major salvo as a [[public intellectual]], Friedman published ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', a major defense of [[capitalism]] and critique of the New Deal and the emerging [[welfare state]].  The book would eventually sell half a million copies.

In 1964, Friedman served as an economic adviser to [[Barry Goldwater]] during his failed presidential campaign.  Like Friedman, Goldwater had come to reject the New Deal and called for a return to laissez-faire economic principles.  This position was extreme in 1964, but gained momentum over the next two decades, finally culminating in the presidency of [[Ronald Reagan]].

In 1966, Friedman began publishing a tri-weekly column for ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine, giving his ideas wider public dissemination.  (He would continue writing this column until 1983.)  

In 1968, he served on [[Richard Nixon]]'s committee of economic advisers.  In 1969, Nixon appointed him to the Advisory Commission on an All-Volunteer Force (the "[[Thomas S. Gates, Jr.|Gates]] Commission"), on which Friedman loudly advocated against the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] and in favor of a [[voluntary military]], a result which was achieved in the US in 1973.

In 1975, Friedman was a keynote speaker at a high-profile economic conference in Santiago, Chile, where he paved the way for the economic programme designed by the so-called [[Chicago Boys]].  Friedman subsequently wrote on free market policies in the Chilean context. Given the Chilean regime's woeful human rights record, Friedman's meeting with [[Pinochet]] and his top advisors caused outrage among many of a left-leaning conviction and arguably tarred free-market reform with a similar brush.

===Nobel Prize and Retirement, 1977-2006===

In 1976, Friedman won the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] "for his achievements in the fields of consumption analysis, [[money supply|monetary]] history and theory and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy." 

In 1977, at age 65, Friedman retired from the University of Chicago after teaching there for thirty years.  He and his wife moved to [[San Francisco]].  From 1977 on, he was affiliated with the [[Hoover Institution]] at [[Stanford University]].

In 1977, Friedman was approached by the [http://www.prcfund.org/index.htm Palmer R. Chitester Fund] and asked to create a television program presenting his economic and social philosophy.  The Friedmans worked on this project for the next three years, and in 1980, the ten-part series, entitled ''[[Free to Choose]]'', aired on [[PBS]].  The companion book to the series (co-authored by Milton and Rose Friedman), also entitled ''Free to Choose'', was the bestselling nonfiction book of 1980 and has since been translated into 14 foreign languages.

Friedman served as an unofficial adviser to Ronald Reagan during his 1980 presidential campaign, and then served on the President's Economic Policy Advisory Board for the rest of the [[Reagan Administration]].  In 1988, he received the [[National Medal of Science]] and Reagan honored him with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]. 
Milton Friedman is today known as one of the most influential economists of the 20th century.<ref>''[http://www.economist.com/daily/news/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8190872 Milton Friedman: An enduring legacy]'', The Economist, November 17, 2006, retrieved November 20, 2006; Patricia Sullivan and Carlos Lozada ''[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/16/AR2006111600592.html Economist Touted Laissez-Faire Policy]'', The Washington Post, November 17, 2006, retrieved November 20, 2006</ref>

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Friedman continued to write [[op-eds]] and appear in the media.  He made several trips to [[Eastern Europe]] and to [[China]].

A proponent of [[school vouchers]] since the 1950s, in 1996, the Friedmans established the Milton and Rose D. Friedman Foundation to advocate for school vouchers.

The Friedmans' memoirs, ''Two Lucky People'' by Milton and Rose Friedman, were published in 1998.

Milton Friedman died at the age of 94 in [[San Francisco]] on [[November 16]] [[2006]] of [[heart failure]].<ref name=reuters_20061116>"[http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=domesticNews&storyID=2006-11-16T185745Z_01_WBT006219_RTRUKOC_0_US-FRIEDMAN.xml&WTmodLoc=NewsArt-C2-NextArticle-1 Free market economist Milton Friedman dead at 94]."

==Scholarly contributions==
Friedman was best known for reviving interest in the money supply as a determinant of the nominal value of output, that is, the [[quantity theory of money]]. [[Monetarism]] is the set of views associated with modern quantity theory. Its origins can be traced back to the 16th century [[School of Salamanca#money.2C value.2C and price|School of Salamanca]] or even further but Friedman's contribution is largely responsible for its modern formulation. He co-authored, with [[Anna Schwartz]], ''A Monetary History of the United States'' (1963), which sought to examine the role of the money supply and [[economy of the United States|economic activity]] in U.S. history. A striking conclusion of their research was one regarding the role of money supply fluctuations as contributing to economic fluctuations. Or, as a Federal Reserve official ([[Ben Bernanke]]) joked on the occasion of Friedman's 90th birthday in 2002: "Regarding the [[Great Depression]]. You're right, we did it. We're very sorry." Several regression studies with David Meiselman in the 1960s suggested the primacy of the money supply over investment and government spending in determining consumption and output. These challenged a prevailing but largely untested view on their relative importance. Friedman's empirical research and some theory supported the conclusion that the short-run effect of a change in the money supply was primarily on output but that the longer-run effect was primarily on the price level.

Friedman was the leading proponent of the [[monetarism|monetarist]] school of economic thought. He maintained that there is a close and stable link between [[inflation]] and the [[money supply]], mainly that the phenomenon of inflation is to be regulated by controlling the amount of money poured into the national economy by the Federal Reserve Bank; he rejected the use of [[fiscal policy]] as a tool of [[demand]] management; and he held that the government's role in the guidance of the economy should be severely restricted. Friedman wrote extensively on the Great Depression, which he called the [[Great Contraction]], arguing that it had been caused by an ordinary financial [[shock (economics)|shock]] whose duration and seriousness were greatly increased by the subsequent contraction of the money supply caused by the misguided policies of the directors of the Federal Reserve. "The Fed was largely responsible for converting what might have been a garden-variety recession, although perhaps a fairly severe one, into a major catastrophe. Instead of using its powers to offset the depression, it presided over a decline in the quantity of money by one-third from 1929 to 1933.... Far from the depression being a failure of the free-enterprise system, it was a tragic failure of government."<ref>(''Two Lucky  People, p 233)</ref> Friedman also argued for the cessation of government intervention in [[Foreign exchange market|currency markets]], thereby spawning an enormous literature on the subject, as well as promoting the practice of freely floating [[exchange rate]]s. Friedman's macroeconomic theories were soon displaced. His close friend [[George Stigler]] explained, "As is customary in science, he did not win a full victory, in part because research was directed along different lines by the [[Rational expectations|theory of rational expectations]], a newer approach developed by [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]], also at the University of Chicago."<ref>Stigler, p 34</ref>

Friedman was also known for his refinement of the consumption function, the [[permanent income hypothesis]] (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work.<ref>Interview on Charlie Rose Show  [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-921891628093252478&q=tvshow%3ACharlie_Rose 11/17/06], originally broadcast 12/26/05.</ref> Other important contributions include his critique of the [[Phillips curve]] and the concept of the [[natural rate of unemployment]] (1968). Each of these has implications for the effect of monetary and fiscal policy on output in the short run and the long run.

Friedman's essay "[[Essays in Positive Economics#The Methodology of Positive Economics|The Methodology of Positive Economics]]" (1953) set the epistemological course for his own subsequent research and to a degree that of the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School of Economics]]. There he argued that economics as ''science'' should be free of value judgments for it to be objective. Moreover, a useful economic theory should be judged not by its descriptive realism (hair color, etc.) but by its simplicity and fruitfulness as an engine of prediction.

==Other public policy positions==
Friedman also supported various [[libertarianism|libertarian]] policies such as decriminalization of [[recreational drug|drugs]] and [[prostitution]]. In addition, he headed the Nixon administration committee that researched the possibility of a move towards a paid/volunteer armed force, and played a large role in the abolition of the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] that took place in the 1970s in the U.S. He would later state that his role in eliminating the draft was his proudest accomplishment.<ref>http://www.reason.com/news/show/29691.html</ref> He served as a member of President Reagan's [[Economic Policy Advisory Board]] in 1981. In 1988, he received both the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] and the [[National Medal of Science]]. He said that he was a libertarian philosophically, but a member of the U.S. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] for the sake of "expediency" ("I am a libertarian with a small 'l' and a Republican with a capital 'R.' And I am a Republican with a capital 'R' on grounds of expediency, not on principle.") But, he said, "I think the term [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] is also equally applicable. I don't really care very much what I'm called. I'm much more interested in having people thinking about the ideas, rather than the person."<ref>[http://queensjournal.ca/article.php?point=vol129/issue37/features/lead1 ''Friedman and Freedom''], Interview with Peter Jaworski. ''The Journal'', Queen's University, March 15, 2002 - Issue 37, Volume 129</ref>

Friedman is supportive of the state provision of some [[public goods]] that the market is not seen as being able to provide. However, he sees the scope of such goods as being minimal. And, he argues that many of the services performed by government could be performed better by the private sector. Above all, if some public goods are provided by the state, he believes that they should not be a [[legal monopoly]] where private competition is prohibited. For, example, in response to the [[United States Post Office]]'s legal monopoly on mail, he said, "there is no way to justify our present [[public monopoly]] of the post office. It may be argued that the carrying of mail is a [[technical monopoly]] and that a [[government monopoly]] is the least of evils. Along these lines, one could perhaps justify a government post office, but not the present law, which makes it illegal for anybody else to carry the mail. If the delivery of mail is a technical monopoly, no one else will be able to succeed in competition with the government. If it is not, there is no reason why the government should be engaged in it. The only way to find out is to leave other people free to enter."<ref>Friedman, Milton & Rose D. ''Capitalism and Freedom'', University of Chicago Press, 1982, p. 29</ref> In recent years, Friedman devoted much of his effort to promoting [[Education voucher|school vouchers]] that can be used to pay for tuition at both [[education in the United States|private and public schools]], saying, "What is needed in America is a voucher of substantial size available to all students, and free of excessive regulations." His idea was that vouchers would allow private schools to compete with the public school monopoly.

Friedman made headlines by proposing a [[negative income tax]] to replace the existing [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] system and then opposing the bill to implement it because it merely supplemented the existing system rather than replace it. 
In 2005, Friedman and more than 500 other economists called for discussions regarding the economic benefits of the [[legal issues of cannabis|legalization of marijuana]].<ref>[http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/endorsers.html An open letter], via Prohibitioncosts.org</ref>

[[Michael Walker]] of the [[Fraser Institute]] and Friedman hosted a series of conferences from 1986 to 1994. The goal was to create a clear definition of [[Economic freedom]] and a method for measuring it. Eventually this resulted in the first report on worldwide economic freedom, ''Economic Freedom in the World''. These annual report has since provided data for numerous peer-reviewed studies and has influenced policy in several nations.

Along with sixteen other distinguished economists he opposed the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]] and filled an [[amicus brief]] in [[Eldred v. Ashcroft]].[http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/openlaw/eldredvashcroft/supct/amici/economists.pdf]

==Other honors, recognition, and influence==
Friedman allowed the [[Cato Institute]] to use his name for its [[Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty]] in 2001. The award is given out biannually. The Friedman Prize went to the late British economist Peter Bauer in 2002, Peruvian economist [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]] in 2004 and Mart Laar, former Estonian Prime Minister in 2006. 

His wife Rose, sister of [[Aaron Director]], with whom he founded the [[Milton and Rose D. Friedman Foundation for School Choice]], served in the international selection committee. Friedman's son, [[David D. Friedman]], has carried on his tradition of arguing in favor of free markets, but to a further extreme, advocating [[anarcho-capitalism]].

At a ceremony celebrating Friedman's achievements, [[Alan Greenspan]] said "There are many Nobel Prize winners in economics, but few have achieved the mythical status of Milton Friedman."<ref>Formaini, Robert L. [http://www.dallasfed.org/research/ei/ei0202.html ''Milton Friedman<U+2014>Economist as Public Intellectual'']. ''Economic Insights'' Volume 7, Number 2. [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas]]. 2002.</ref>

According to [[Harry Girvetz]] and [[Kenneth Minogue]], Friedman was co-responsible with [[Friedrich von Hayek]] for providing the intellectual foundations for the revival of classical liberalism in the 20th century.<ref name="Britannica">Girvetz, Harry K. and Minogue Kenneth. [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9117288?query=liberalism&ct=eb ''Liberalism''], Encyclopedia Britannica (online), p. 16, retrieved May 16,2006</ref>

===China===
Milton Friedman delivered a speech entitled [http://www.lulu.com/ching "The Chinese Economic Reform"] in 1988 to Chinese students and scholars in the San Francisco Bay Area. The taped speech was hand-delivered to [[Zhu Rongji]], the architect of the Chinese Economic Reform.

===Hong Kong===
Friedman once said "if you want to see capitalism in action, go to [[Hong Kong]]". He believed the [[economy of Hong Kong|Hong Kong economy]] is the best example of a [[laissez-faire]] capitalism economy.

One month before his death, he wrote the article "Hong Kong Wrong - What would Cowperthwaite say?" in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', criticizing [[Donald Tsang]], Chief Executive of Hong Kong, for abandoning "positive noninterventionism". <ref name=wsj_20061006>"http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110009051" Dr. Milton Friedman, ''[[Wall Street Journal - Opinion Journal]]. [[October 6]], [[2006]]</ref> Tsang later said he was merely changing the slogan to "big market, small government", where small government is defined as less than 20% of GDP. In a debate between Tsang and [[Alan Leong]], rival for the position of Chief Executive, Leong brought up the topic and accused Tsang of angering Friedman to death. 

Just before he died, he criticized Hong Kong's [[School voucher#Hong Kong|kindergarten voucher]] system as "not properly structured".


===Chile===
:''For more information on Milton Friedman's views on Chile, see [[Miracle of Chile]].''
Friedman's economic ideas were implemented in [[Chile]] under the military government of General [[Augusto Pinochet]]. It had never happened before (or since) that an economic theory was implemented so rigorously, which gave economics a unique opportunity for scientific research because it can normally not experiment and thus [[verify]] or [[falsify]] its theories.

Friedman visited [[Chile]] in 1975 during Pinochet's rule. Invited by a private foundation, he gave a series of lectures on economics. Several professors from the University of Chicago became advisors{{Fact|date=February 2007}} to the Chilean government and several Ph.D. graduates from the same university &ndash; known as "the [[Chicago boys]]" &ndash; served in Chilean ministries. Friedman met with Pinochet during his visit to Chile, but he did not serve as a formal advisor to the Chilean government or maintain personal contact with Pinochet. He was, however, willing to advise Pinochet after Pinochet overthrew the democratically elected government of Salvador Allende, and was widely criticized for doing so.<ref>  [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitext/prof_miltonfriedman.html Profile of Milton Friedman"] PBS.org</ref>He had given a lecture advocating monetarist economics to the Catholic University of Chile. Friedman said that the "the emphasis of that talk was that free markets would undermine political centralization and political control."<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/ufd_reformliberty_full.html Interview with Jeffery Sachs on the "Miracle of Chile"] PBS.org</ref>  

Friedman did not criticize Pinochet's dictatorship at the time, nor the assassinations, illegal imprisonments, torture, or other atrocities that were well-known by then, <ref>[http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2064741.ece General Augusto Pinochet] (The Independent): "visit to Santiago in March 1975 of their guru, Professor Milton Friedman. He approved of the dictatorship and chose not to criticise the assassinations, illegal imprisonments, torture, exile and other atrocities - all exhaustively chronicled by Amnesty International"</ref>although later, in ''Free to Choose'' he said the following: "Chile is not a politically free system and I do not condone the political system...the conditions of the people in the past few years has been getting better and not worse.  They would be still better to get rid of the junta and to be able to have a free democratic system."<ref>[http://www.freetochoose.net/1980_vol5_transcript.html Free to Choose Vol. 5]</ref>  When he went to receive his Nobel prize in Stockholm, he was met by demonstrations.<ref>[http://www.latinbusinesschronicle.com/app/article.aspx?id=535 Milton Friedman Influenced Latin America] (Latin Business Chronicle):"And Friedman also received plenty of criticism for even advising Pinochet, including large demonstrations when he received the Nobel award in Stockholm."</ref> In an interview on the PBS program ''[[Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy#Documentary|Commanding Heights]]'' in 2000, Friedman attributed these demonstrations to communists seeking to discredit anyone with only the slightest connection to Pinochet--such as himself--by opponents he recognized from earlier occasions, adding that "there was no doubt that there was a concerted effort to tar and feather me."<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/int_miltonfriedman.html Milton Friedman interview PBS.org]</ref>

Friedman defended his role in Chile on the grounds that the move towards open market policies not only improved the economic situation in Chile but also contributed to the softening of Pinochet's rule and to the eventual constitutional transition to a democratic government in 1990. He also stressed that the lectures he gave in Chile were the same lectures he later gave in [[People's Republic of China|China]] and other [[Socialism|socialist]] states.<ref>Friedman and Friedman, ''Two Lucky People:Memoirs'', p.600-601</ref> In the 2000 PBS documentary ''The Commanding Heights'', Friedman also noted that this criticism was misdirected and missed his main point. Friedman advocated that freer markets led to free people, and that Chile had an unfree economy which led to the military government, which then implemented open economy policies. These policies led to the end of military rule and a "free society".<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/int_miltonfriedman.html Milton Friedman interview PBS.org]</ref>

===Iceland===
:
Friedman visited [[Iceland]] in the autumn of 1984, met with prominent Icelanders and gave a lecture at the University of Iceland on the Tyranny of the Status Quo. He participated in a [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1107486496526618897&sourceid=docidfeed&hl=en lively television debate] August 31st with leading socialist intellectuals, including President [[<U+00D3>lafur Ragnar Gr<U+00ED>msson]]. When they complained that a fee was charged for attending his lecture at the University and that hitherto lectures by visiting scholars had been free-of-charge, Friedman replied that of course previous lectures had not been free-of-charge in a meaningful sense: There were always costs attached to lectures. What mattered was whether those who attended the lecture, were charged, or those who did not attend. He himself thought that it was fairer that only those who attended, paid. When Friedman was introduced, at a luncheon, to a governor of Iceland<U+2019>s Central Bank with the words, that this person would become unemployed if Friedman<U+2019>s theories were implemented in Iceland, Friedman immediately responded: "No, you would not become unemployed. You would only have to move to a more beneficial kind of employment." 

Friedman made a great impact on a group of young intellectuals in the [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]], including [[Dav<U+00ED><U+00F0> Oddsson]] who became Prime Minister in 1991 and began a radical programme of monetary and fiscal stabilisation, ambitious privatisation, reduction of taxes (e.g. the corporate incomes tax from 45% to 18%), the definition of exclusive use rights in the fisheries, abolition of various government funds for aiding loss-making enterprises and liberalisation of currency transfers and capital markets. In 1975, Iceland had the 53rd freest economy in the world, whereas in 2004, it had the 9th freest economy, according to the [[Indices of Economic Freedom|Economic Freedom Index]] designed by Canada<U+2019>s [[Fraser Institute]]. According to the [[Indices of Economic Freedom|index]] designed by the [[Heritage Foundation]], Iceland has the 5th freest economy in the world. [[Dav<U+00ED><U+00F0> Oddsson]] was Prime Minister for thirteen and a half years, to 2004. [[Geir H. Haarde]] who followed him as leader of the Independence Party and who is at present Prime Minister, follows the same policies.<ref>[http://courses.wcupa.edu/rbove/eco343/040Compecon/Scand/Iceland/040129prosper.htm Article on Icelandic economic miracle by [[Hannes H<U+00F3>lmsteinn Gissurarson|H.H.Gissurarson]] in [[Wall Street Journal]] 2004].</ref>

===Estonia===

Although Friedman never visited [[Estonia]], his book ''[[Free to Choose]]'' exercised a great influence on the then 32-year-old prime minister of Estonia [[Mart Laar]], who has claimed that it was the only book on economics he had read before taking office.  Laar's reforms are often credited with responsibility for transforming Estonia from an impoverished Soviet Republic to the "Baltic Tiger."  A prime element of Laar's program was introduction of the [[flat tax]].  Laar won the 2006 [http://www.cato.org/special/friedman/laar/ Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty], awarded by the [[Cato Institute]].

As a result of Laar's adherence to the principles in ''[[Free to Choose]]'', Estonia now consistently ranks highly in the Heritage Foundation/''Wall Street Journal'' [http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/ Economic Freedom Index].
