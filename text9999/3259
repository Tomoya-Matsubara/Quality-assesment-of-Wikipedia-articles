'''J<U+00FC>rgen Bartsch''' (born '''Karl-Heinz Sadrozinski''', November 6, 1946 in [[Essen]] <U+2013> April 28, 1976 in [[Lippstadt#Division_of_the_town|Eickelborn]]) was a [[West Germany|West German]] [[serial killer]] who murdered four boys ages 8<U+2013>13 and attempted to kill another. The case of the sexual offender Bartsch in German jurisdiction history was the first to include psycho-social factors of the defendant, who came from a violent early surrounding, to set down the degree of penalty.  

==Early life==
Bartsch was an illegitimate child whose birth mother died of [[tuberculosis]] soon afterward, and he spent the first months of his life being cared for by nurses.  At 11 months he was [[adopt]]ed by a butcher and his wife in [[Langenberg]] (today Velbert-Langenberg), who gave him the name J<U+00FC>rgen Bartsch. Bartsch's adoptive mother, who suffered from [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], was fixated on cleanliness. He was not permitted to play with other children, lest he become dirty. This continued into adulthood; his mother personally bathed him until he was 19 {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}. At the age of 10, Bartsch entered school. Because, in his parents' opinion, it was not sufficiently strict, he was moved to a [[Catholic]] boarding school.

==Murders==
Bartsch began killing at the age of fifteen. His first victim was Klaus Jung who was murdered in 1961. His next victim was Peter Fuchs who was killed four years later in 1965. He persuaded all of his victims to accompany him into an abandoned air-raid shelter, where he forced them to undress and then [[sexual abuse|sexually abused]] them. He dismembered his first four victims. His intended fifth victim, 15-year-old Peter Frese, however, escaped by burning through his bindings with a candle that Bartsch had left burning after leaving the shelter.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEXA76FHDE ''Der Kinderm<U+00F6>rder J<U+00FC>rgen Bartsch'']</ref> Bartsch was arrested in 1966.

==Sentence==
Upon arrest, Bartsch openly confessed to his crimes. He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] on December 15, 1967, by the [[Wuppertal]] regional court (''Landgericht Wuppertal''). Initially, the sentence was upheld on [[appeal]]. However, in 1971, the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]], returned the case to the ''Landgericht'' D<U+00FC>sseldorf, which reduced the sentence to 10 years of juvenile detention and had Bartsch placed under psychiatric care in [[Lippstadt#Division_of_the_town|Eickelborn]]. There, he married Gisela Deike of [[Hanover]] on February 15, 1973.

==Death==
The [[forensic]] psychiatrists considered various therapy concepts: [[psychotherapy]], [[castration]] and even [[psychosurgery]]. Bartsch initially refused any surgery but finally agreed to voluntary [[castration]] on April 28, 1976 in order to avoid lifetime incarceration in a mental hospital. This was about ten years after incarceration, two years after his marriage, and after his [[clinical depression|depressive]] condition did not improve. The doctors of Eickelborn State Hospital chose a castration methodology that accidentally resulted in Bartsch's death. An official [[autopsy]] and [[Criminal procedure|investigation]] determined that Bartsch had been intoxicated with a [[Halothane]] overdose (factor 10) by an insufficiently trained nurse.<ref>[http://www.daserste.de/kriminalfaelle/sendung_dyn~uid,uqkywjak0oqysllwnauba2q6~cm.asp Script of a documentary TV show (german)]</ref>

==Influence==
The 2002 film ''Ein Leben lang kurze Hosen tragen'' (released in the [[United States|U.S.]] in 2004, as ''The Child I Never Was'') depicts Bartsch's life and crimes.

[[Bethlehem (German band)|Bethlehem]]'s bassist and main songwriter uses the name J<U+00FC>rgen Bartsch.
