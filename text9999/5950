'''Tyrosol''' is a [[phenol]]ic [[antioxidant]] present in a variety of natural sources.  The principle source in the human diet is [[olive oil]].  Tyrosol is a derivative of [[phenethyl alcohol]]

As an antioxidant, tyrosol can protect cells against injury due to oxidation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Giovannini C, Straface E, Modesti D, Coni E, Cantafora A, De Vincenzi M, Malorni W, Masella R |title=Tyrosol, the major olive oil biophenol, protects against oxidized-LDL-induced injury in Caco-2 cells |journal=J. Nutr. |volume=129 |issue=7 |pages=1269-77 |year=1999 |pmid=10395586}}</ref>   Although it is not as potent as other antioxidants present in olive oil, its higher concentration and good [[bioavailability]] indicate that it may have an important overall effect.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mir<U+00F3>-Casas E, Covas M, Fit<U+00F3> M, Farr<U+00E9>-Albadalejo M, Marrugat J, de la Torre R |title=Tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol are absorbed from moderate and sustained doses of virgin olive oil in humans |journal=European journal of clinical nutrition |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=186-90 |year=2003 |pmid=12548315}}</ref>  This effect may contribute significantly to the health benefits of olive oil and, more generally, the [[Mediterranean diet]].
