'''Otto Everett Graham, Jr.''' ({{nowrap|December 6, 1921}} &ndash; {{nowrap|December 17, 2003}}) was an [[American football]] [[quarterback]] who played for the [[Cleveland Browns]] in the [[All-America Football Conference]] and [[National Football League]]. Graham is regarded by critics as one of the most dominant players of his era, having taken the Browns to league championship games every year between 1946 and 1955, winning seven of them. With Graham at quarterback, the Browns posted a record of 114 wins, 20 losses and four ties, including a 9<U+2013>3 [[Winning percentage|win<U+2013>loss record]] in the [[National Football League playoffs|playoffs]]. While most of Graham's statistical records have been surpassed in the modern era, he still holds the NFL record for career average [[Yards from scrimmage|yards gained]] per [[Forward pass#American and Canadian football|pass attempt]], with nine. Long-time [[New York Yankees]] owner [[George Steinbrenner]], a friend of Graham's, once called him "as great of a quarterback as there ever was."<ref name="Graham obit" />

Graham grew up in [[Waukegan, Illinois]], the son of music teachers. He entered [[Northwestern University]] in 1940 on a basketball scholarship, but football soon became his main sport. After a brief stint in the military at the end of [[World War II]], Graham played during the 1946 season for the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League's]] [[Sacramento Kings|Rochester Royals]], who won the league championship that year. [[Paul Brown]], Cleveland's coach, signed Graham to play for the Browns, where he thrived. After he left football in 1955, Graham coached college teams in the [[College All-Star Game]] and became head football coach at the [[Coast Guard Academy]] in [[Connecticut]]. After seven years at the academy, he spent three unsuccessful seasons as head coach of the [[Washington Redskins]]. Following his resignation, he returned to the Coast Guard Academy, where he served as athletic director until his retirement in 1984. He was elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1965.

==Early life and college career==

Born in [[Waukegan, Illinois]], Graham's first interest growing up was music.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=19}} Encouraged by his parents, both of whom were music teachers, he took up several instruments: the piano, violin, [[cornet]] and [[French horn]].{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=79}}{{sfn|Boyer|2006|p=12}} Graham also excelled in athletics, and attended [[Northwestern University]] on a basketball scholarship in 1940.<ref name="Schwartz on Graham">{{cite news|last=Schwartz|first=Larry|title='Automatic Otto' defined versatility|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014210.html|accessdate=August 24, 2012|newspaper=ESPN.com|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6A9YSqdkZ|archivedate=August 24, 2012}}</ref> There he played on the varsity basketball team as a [[freshman]] and continued to study music.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=54}}<ref name="Graham primary-source bio">{{cite web|title="Otto" Biography|url=http://www.ottograham.net/biography/|publisher=Ottograham.net|accessdate=August 24, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6A9YlgJSy|archivedate=August 24, 2012}}</ref> Graham did not take up football until his [[sophomore]] year, when Northwestern coach [[Pappy Waldorf]] saw him throwing in an [[Intramural sports|intramural]] game and invited him to practice with the team.<ref name="Schwartz on Graham" />{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=54}} Northwestern's coaches were impressed with his running and passing, and Waldorf convinced him to sign up.<ref name="Schwartz on Graham" />{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=54}} Although football became Graham's primary sport, he also played baseball and continued on the basketball team.

Graham's first game for the [[Northwestern Wildcats football]] team was on October 4, 1941, when he caught a [[Kansas State University|Kansas State]] [[punt (football)|punt]] and [[Punt (football)#Return|returned]] it 90&nbsp;yards for a [[touchdown]].

Impressed by Graham's performances in Northwestern's wins over Ohio State in 1941 and 1943, Paul Brown came and offered him a contract worth $7,500 per year (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|7500|1945}}}} in {{currentyear}} dollars) in 1945 to play for a professional team he was coaching in [[Cleveland]] in the new [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC).{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=80}} Graham would not receive his salary until he started playing, however, and Brown added a monthly [[stipend]] of $250 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|250|1945}}}} in {{currentyear}}) until the end of the war.{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=80}} It was a large amount of money at the time. "All I asked was, where do I sign?" Graham said later. "Some of the other navy men said I was rooting for the war to last forever."{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=80}} Graham was also drafted by the [[National Football League]]'s [[Detroit Lions]], but he did not sign a contract or play a game with the team as the war wore on.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=20}} 

Large numbers of athletes came home as the conflict wound down in Europe with [[German Instrument of Surrender|Germany's surrender]] in the summer of 1945. The AAFC's first season was not set to start until the fall of 1946, and Graham occupied the intervening months by joining the [[Rochester Royals]] of the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] (NBL), a forerunner of the [[National Basketball Association]].{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=19<U+2013>20}} In March 1946, the Royals swept a best-of-five series against the [[Sheboygan Redskins]] to win the NBL title.<ref name="Royals win championship">{{cite news|last=Larson|first=Lloyd|title=Rochester Clips Skins, Wins Title|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LbwdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BQ0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7140,4025504&dq=rochester+royals&hl=en|accessdate=July 4, 2012|newspaper=The Milwaukee Sentinel|date=March 24, 1946|page=1}}</ref>

==Professional career==
===Cleveland Browns in the AAFC (1946<U+2013>1949)===

By the time Graham was discharged from the Navy late in the summer of 1946, [[Training camp (National Football League)|training camp]] for Brown's new team, the [[Cleveland Browns]], had already begun.{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=86}} Concerned that Graham was not ready to start, Brown put in [[Cliff Lewis]] at quarterback in the first game of the season. Graham, however, soon replaced Lewis in Brown's [[T formation]] offense.{{sfn|Cantor|2008|pp=86<U+2013>87}}{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=11}} Handing the ball to [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] [[Marion Motley]] and throwing to [[Wide receiver|ends]] [[Dante Lavelli]] and [[Mac Speedie]], Graham led the team to a 12<U+2013>2 regular-season record and a spot in the championship game against the [[New York Yankees (AAFC)|AAFC's New York Yankees]].{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=11}}{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=62<U+2013>63}}{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=207}} The Browns won that game, touching off a period of dominance.{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=11}}{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=64}} The team won each of the AAFC's four championships between 1946 and 1949, and had professional football's first perfect season in 1948 by finishing undefeated and untied.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=64, 81, 121, 145}}

Graham's play was crucial to Cleveland's success. He averaged 10.5&nbsp;yards per pass and had a [[quarterback rating]] of 112.1 in 1946, a professional football record until [[Joe Montana]] surpassed it in 1989.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=66, 85}} Graham was named the AAFC's Most Valuable Player in 1947 and shared the Most Valuable Player award with [[Frankie Albert]] of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in 1948.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=82, 121}} He led the league in passing yards between 1947 and 1949.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=82, 121, 148}} The AAFC dissolved after the 1949 season, and three of its teams, including the Browns, merged into the more established [[National Football League]].{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=141}} Graham was the AAFC's all-time leading passer, throwing for 10,085&nbsp;yards and 86 touchdowns.{{sfn|Keim|1999|pp=64<U+2013>65}}{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=149}}

Graham became the Browns' uncontested leader, but he was also "just one of the guys," tackle [[Mike McCormack (American football)|Mike McCormack]] said in 1999. "He was not aloof, which you see a lot of times today."{{sfn|Keim|1999|p=65}} He was good at spinning and moving in the [[Passing pocket|pocket]], skills he learned playing basketball.{{sfn|Keim|1999|p=64}} In his autobiography, Paul Brown praised Graham's ability to anticipate his receivers' route-running by watching their shoulders.{{sfn|Keim|1999|p=65}} "I remember his tremendous peripheral vision and his great athletic skill, as well as his ability to throw a football far and accurately with just a flick of his arm," Brown said.{{sfn|Keim|1999|p=65}} His short passes were hard and accurate, teammates later said, and his long balls were soft. "I used to catch a lot of them one-handed," Lavelli said. "He had great touch in his hands."{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=20}} He was nicknamed "Automatic Otto" for his consistency and toughness.{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=129}}

===Cleveland Browns in the NFL (1950<U+2013>1955)===

With Graham at the helm, the Browns continued to succeed when they joined the NFL in 1950. Graham led the Browns to a 10<U+2013>2 record, which set up a playoff against the [[New York Giants]] for a spot in the [[1950 NFL Championship Game|championship game]].{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=207}}{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=24}}{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=173}} The Browns' only two losses of the season had come against the Giants, but in a frozen [[Cleveland Stadium]] on {{nowrap|December 17,}} Cleveland beat New York.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=173<U+2013>174}} With the game tied 3<U+2013>3 in the fourth quarter, Graham gained 45&nbsp;yards by running with the ball on a long drive to set up a 28-yard [[Lou Groza]] field goal that put the Browns ahead 6<U+2013>3.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=175}} A [[Safety (American and Canadian football score)|safety]] after the ensuing kickoff made the final score 8<U+2013>3.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=175}}

The win put Cleveland in the NFL championship game against the [[Los Angeles Rams]].{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=24}}{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=176}} Graham's rushing and passing were again key to the Browns' 30<U+2013>28 victory. He drove the offense downfield as time expired to set up a last-minute Groza field goal that sealed the win.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=181}} Graham had 99&nbsp;yards rushing in the game, adding 298&nbsp;yards of passing and four touchdowns.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=183}}

Cleveland posted a 11<U+2013>1 record in 1951, losing its only game to the San Francisco 49ers in the season opener.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=224, 232}} That gave the Browns another spot in the [[1951 NFL Championship Game|championship game]], again against the Rams.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=232}} This time, however, the Rams won 27<U+2013>17. Graham fumbled the ball in the third quarter, setting up a touchdown that put the Rams ahead 14<U+2013>10.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=232}} Three of his throws were [[interception (American football)|intercepted]], but he put up 280&nbsp;yards of passing and a touchdown.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=233<U+2013>234}} After the season, Graham was named the league's Most Valuable Player.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=235}}

The 1953 season began with a 27<U+2013>0 win over the [[Green Bay Packers]] in which Graham passed for 292&nbsp;yards and ran for two touchdowns.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=270}} It was the first of 11 straight victories for the Browns, whose only loss came in the final game of the season to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=275}} Near the end of the season in a game against the 49ers, Graham took a forearm to the face from [[Art Michalik]] that opened a gash on his chin requiring 15 stitches.

Before the start of the Browns' 1954 training camp, Graham was questioned as part of the [[Sam Sheppard]] murder case. Sheppard, an [[osteopath]], was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant wife to death, and Graham and his wife, Beverly, were friends with the couple.

The 1954 season was a transitional one for the Browns. Many of the players who joined the 1946 team had retired or were nearing the end of their careers.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=305}} Graham, meanwhile, told Brown that he would retire after the season.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=310}} After losing the first three games, Cleveland won eight in a row and earned another shot at the [[1954 NFL Championship Game|championship]], again against the Lions.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=319}} This time, the Browns won 56<U+2013>10 as Graham ran for three touchdowns and passed for three more.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=324<U+2013>325}} He announced his retirement after the game.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=325<U+2013>326}}

After Graham's potential replacements struggled during the 1955 training camp and preseason, Brown convinced Graham to come back and play one more year.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=332}} He was offered a salary of $25,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25000|1955}}}} today), making him the highest-paid player in the NFL.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=333}} The Browns lost the opener against the [[Washington Redskins]], but went on to a 10<U+2013>2 regular-season record and another chance at a [[1955 NFL Championship Game|championship]].{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=284}} Graham threw two touchdowns and ran for two more as the Browns beat the Rams 38<U+2013>14.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=341}} When Brown took Graham out of the game in the fourth quarter, the crowd in the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]] gave him a standing ovation.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=342}} It was the final performance of a 10-year career in which Graham's team reached the championship each year and won seven.
