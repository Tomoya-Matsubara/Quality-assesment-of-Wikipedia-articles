'''''System Shock 2''''' (commonly abbreviated '''''SS2''''' or '''''Shock 2''''') is a [[First person perspective | first person]] [[action role-playing game | action role-playing]] [[video game]], designed by [[Ken Levine]]. The title was co-developed by [[Irrational Games]] and [[Looking Glass Studios]] as a stand alone title, heavily influenced by the seminal 1994 PC game ''[[System Shock]]''. After [[Electronic Arts]] signed on to publish, story changes were made to incorporate the ''Shock'' franchise. ''System Shock 2'' was released on August 11, 1999 by Electronic Arts.

The game takes place on board an adrift [[starship]] in a [[cyberpunk]] vision of 2114. The player assumes the role of a lone soldier who tries to stem the outbreak of a genetic infection that has devastated the ship. Gameplay mainly consists of first person action and exploration, while a [[role-playing game system| role-playing system]] allows the player to develop unique abilities and traits.<ref name = "1UP ss2"/>

== Gameplay ==

Like its predecessor, gameplay in ''System Shock 2'' is an amalgamation of the [[first person shooter]] and [[role-playing game | role-playing game (RPG)]] genres. The player uses various weapons to defeat enemies, while a [[Role-playing game system | role-playing system]] allows the player to develop a variety of useful skills. Navigation is presented from a [[First person (video games)|first-person perspective]] and complemented with a [[HUD (computer gaming)| heads-up display]] that shows character and weapon information, a map, and a [[drag and drop]] inventory.<ref name = "1UP ss2">{{ cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3165915 | title = Smart Bombs: Beloved Games That Flopped (page 2) | author = Mackey, Bob | publisher = [[1UP.com]] | date = 2007-02-05 | accessdate = 2008-04-07 }}</ref> [[Backstory]] is explained progressively through the acquisition of audio logs.<ref name = "IGN SS2 review"/>

When the game begins, the player must pursue a career in a fictional military, the Unified National Nominate. Each branch of service introduces its own unique skills: The [[marine | marines]] are combat experts and augment weapon proficiency; the [[Navy]] demonstrate expertise in engineering and [[Hacker (computer security) | hacking]]; and the OSA is a [[paranormal]] branch of military that hones [[psychic]] powers.<ref name = "SS2 Manual Character Generation">{{cite book | title = System Shock 2 Instruction Manual | publisher = [[Electronic Arts]] | date = 1999-08-11 | pages = 21}}</ref> 

After choosing a branch and undergoing a character development stage, the player begins receiving "cyber-modules" for completing objectives. Skills are enhanced by spending cyber-modules at devices called "cyber-upgrade units"<ref name = "SS2 Manual Stations"/> O/S units allow special one-time character upgrades to be made (e.g. permanent health enhancement), while in-game currency, called "nanites", may be spent on items at vending machines. "Quantum Bio-Reconstruction Machines" can be activated and reconstitute the player if they die in the same area. Otherwise, the game ends and progress must be resumed from a [[Saved game| save point]].<ref name = "SS2 Manual Stations">{{cite book | title = System Shock 2 Instruction Manual | publisher = [[Electronic Arts]] | date = 1999-08-11 | pages = 24}}</ref>

Some devices, like keypads, gun turrets, and vending machines, can be hacked. When a hack is attempted, a [[minigame]] commences where a grid of green nodes appear. Three nodes must be connected in a straight row for the hack to succeed. As the game progresses, objects become increasingly difficult to hack and red nodes appear. Red nodes are unstable and can cause the object being hacked to break or explode if a connection is attempted. Optionally, electronic [[Lock picking| lock picks]] can be found that automatically hack a device, regardless of its difficulty.<ref name = "SS2 Manual Hack">{{cite book | title = System Shock 2 Instruction Manual | publisher = [[Electronic Arts]] | date = 1999-08-11 | pages = 13}}</ref>

Various weapons can be procured throughout the game, including pistols, shotguns, and alien melee weapons.<ref name = "SS2 Manual Weapons">{{cite book | title = System Shock 2 Instruction Manual | publisher = [[Electronic Arts]] | date = 1999-08-11 | pages = 25, 26}}</ref> All non-melee weapons degrade with use and eventually break.

For example, organic enemies are vulnerable to [[Anti-personnel weapon|anti-personnel rounds]], while mechanical ones are weak against [[Kinetic energy penetrator|armor-piercing rounds]]. Because ammunition is scarce, the player must remain vigilant to unload weapons and carefully search rooms for supplies.<ref name = "SS2 manual hints">{{cite book | title = System Shock 2 Instruction Manual | publisher = [[Electronic Arts]] | date = 1999-08-11 | pages = 37, 38}}</ref> In addition to weapons, psychic powers can be learned that perform a variety of actions, such as acquiring out-of-reach items via [[telepathy]] and hurling energy balls at enemies.<ref name = "SS2 Manual Character Generation"/>

==Plot summary==
===Prologue===
The story begins in 2114, forty-two years after the events of ''[[System Shock]]'', on the ''Von Braun''; an experimental [[faster-than-light]] [[starship]], owned by the fictional TriOptimum Corporation. The ship is undergoing its maiden voyage with the ''Rickenbacker'', a military starship serving as an escort.<ref name = "SS2 Manual World Description">{{cite book | title = System Shock 2 Instruction Manual | publisher = [[Electronic Arts]] | date = 1999-08-11 | pages = 31<U+2013>33}}</ref> After joining the United National Nominate and completing its training regimen, the unnamed protagonist<U+2014>Soldier G65434-2<U+2014> is assigned to the ''Rickenbacker''.<ref group = note>{{citation | title = This name, Soldier G65434-2, is listed in a cutscene prior to awakening in the cryo-tube.}}</ref>
     
A few months into the voyage, the two ships respond to a [[distress signal]] from the planet Tau Ceti V.<ref>'''Korenchkin:''' We have picked up a transmission from the surface of Tau Ceti V. I have been in negotiation with Captain Diego of the Rickenbacker and after some... coercion, he's agreed to go planet side as a joint venture. Imagine, this historic mission might even become more historic. First Contact. And who is there to get exclusive rights to all media, patents and land grants? TriOptimum. Miri, I told you this would be worth it. {{cite video game | title = System Shock 2 | developer = [[Irrational Games]] | publisher = [[Electronic Arts]] | date = 1999-08-11 | platform = [[Personal computer| PC]]}}</ref> A rescue team is sent to the planet surface where they discover strange eggs.<ref>'''Bayliss:''' After a couple of hours it was... it was like being on a bender... long periods that you couldn't remember... one minute we were in that crater... the next minute we were loading up the shuttle with the eggs... I remember hearing that idiot Korenchkin calling the Von Braun and ordering them to clear off the ENTIRE hydroponics deck. Diego seemed to think this was strange and said, 'Are you crazy, Anatoly?' And Korenchkin smiled and said back to him, 'Oh, Captain... WE are not Anatoly... {{cite video game | title = System Shock 2 | developer = [[Irrational Games]] | publisher = [[Electronic Arts]] | date = 1999-08-11 | platform = [[Personal computer| PC]]}}</ref> The eggs infect the rescue team and integrate them into an alien communion who call themselves the Many. The infestation eventually infects both ships, including XERXES, the ''Von Braun's'' main computer.

===Story===
The soldier awakens in a [[Cryonics| cryo]]-tube on the medical deck of the ''Von Braun'' with [[amnesia]] due to a computer malfunction. He is immediately contacted by a survivor, Dr. Janice Polito, who guides him to safety before the [[cabin pressurization#Loss_of_pressurization | cabin depressurizes]]. Polito demands the soldier to rendezvous with her on deck 4.<ref>'''Polito:''' Make sure you expend all your cybernetic modules before you leave this area. You don't know when you'll find another upgrade unit. Now, find a way to deck 4. {{cite video game | title = System Shock 2 | developer = [[Irrational Games]] | publisher = [[Electronic Arts]] | date = 1999-08-11 | platform = [[Personal computer| PC]]}}</ref> Along the way, the soldier battles the infected crew members. The Many also telepathically communicate with him, persuading the soldier to join their collective.

After restarting the ship's engine core and purging an elevator shaft, the soldier reaches deck 4 and discovers Polito is dead. He is then confronted by [[SHODAN]], a malevolent [[artificial intelligence]] who seized control of TriOptimum<U+2019>s space vessel, Citadel Station, forty-two years prior in ''System Shock''. She informs the soldier that she has been posing as Polito to gain his trust<ref>'''SHODAN:''' I used Polito's image to communicate with you, until we had established trust. {{cite video game | title = System Shock 2 | developer = [[Irrational Games]] | publisher = [[Electronic Arts]] | date = 1999-08-11 | platform = [[Personal computer| PC]]}}</ref> and is responsible for the creation of the Many. Together, SHODAN and the Many escaped Citadel station's destruction in a jettisoned subsection and landed on Tau Ceti V thirty years later.<ref>'''SHODAN:''' It ejected the grove, where my creations, and processing component, 43893, were stored. Thirty years later, the grove crash-landed on Tau Ceti V. I survived only by sleeping. In my absence, my creations, my annelids, thrived. {{cite video game | title = System Shock 2 | developer = [[Irrational Games]] | publisher = [[Electronic Arts]] | date = 1999-08-11 | platform = [[Personal computer| PC]]}}</ref> SHODAN had been cultivating these artificial creatures to help establish her god-hood, but they had evolved out of her control.<ref>'''SHODAN:''' Thrived, and grew unruly. And now they seek to destroy me. I will not allow that. {{cite video game | title = System Shock 2 | developer = [[Irrational Games]] | publisher = [[Electronic Arts]] | date = 1999-08-11 | platform = [[Personal computer| PC]]}}</ref> SHODAN issues an ultimatum to the soldier, stating his only chance for survival lies in helping destroy her rebellious creations.<ref>'''SHODAN:''' Remember, that it is my will that guided you here; it is my will that gave you your cybernetic implants<U+2014>the only beauty in that meat you call a body. If you value that meat, you will do as I tell you. {{cite video game | title = System Shock 2 | developer = [[Irrational Games]] | publisher = [[Electronic Arts]] | date = 1999-08-11 | platform = [[Personal computer| PC]]}}</ref> 

After failing to gain control of the ''Von Braun'' via a transmission device, SHODAN informs the soldier that destroying the ship is their only option, but he must first transfer SHODAN<U+2019>s program to the ''Rickenbacker''.<ref>'''SHODAN:''' My creation has run rampant. I demand their extermination. I have no choice but to destroy this starship. We can make our escape in the ''Rickenbacker'', but you must transfer my intelligence to that ship first. {{cite video game | title = System Shock 2 | developer = [[Irrational Games]] | publisher = [[Electronic Arts]] | date = 1999-08-11 | platform = [[Personal computer| PC]]}}</ref> The soldier proceeds to complete his task and briefly encounters two survivors, Tommy Suarez and Rebbecca Siddons, who flee the ship in an escape pod.<ref>'''Siddons:''' Move it, Tommy... the escape pod is this way! {{cite video game | title = System Shock 2 | developer = [[Irrational Games]] | publisher = [[Electronic Arts]] | date = 1999-08-11 | platform = [[Personal computer| PC]]}}</ref> 

After completing the transfer, the soldier travels to the ''Rickenbacker'' and learns both ships have been enveloped by the infection's source, a gigantic mass of bio-organic tissue called the body of the Many.<ref>'''SHODAN:''' The Many has grown to a massive size. It has wrapped itself around these two ships, preventing their separation. {{cite video game | title = System Shock 2 | developer = [[Irrational Games]] | publisher = [[Electronic Arts]] | date = 1999-08-11 | platform = [[Personal computer| PC]]}}</ref> The soldier enters the biomass and destroys its core, stopping the alien infection. SHODAN congratulates the protagonist and informs him she intends to merge real space and cyberspace using the ''Von Braun's'' faster-than-light drive.<ref>'''Delacroix:''' You must understand the stakes here... if SHODAN is left to continue, her reality will completely assimilate ours. Space will become cyberspace and SHODAN's whims will become reality. {{cite video game | title = System Shock 2 | developer = [[Irrational Games]] | publisher = [[Electronic Arts]] | date = 1999-08-11 | platform = [[Personal computer| PC]]}}</ref> The soldier confronts SHODAN in [[cyberspace]] and defeats her.

The final scene shows Tommy and Rebecca receiving a message from the ''Von Braun''. Tommy responds, saying they will return but Rebbecca is feeling ill. Rebbecca is shown speaking similarly to SHODAN.

== Development ==
[[Image:SS2 Concept.jpg| left | thumbnail | 250px | Horror was a key focus of ''System Shock 2''. This [[concept art]] depicts the protagonist encountering an infected crewmember.]] 
Development began in 1997 when [[Looking Glass Studios]] approached upstart [[Irrational Games]] with an idea to co-develop a new game.<ref name = "Gamespot SS2 Retrospect"/> ''System Shock'' was a heavy influence as the development team were big fans and wanted to make a similar game. Early story ideas were inspired by the novella, ''[[Heart of Darkness]]''. In an early draft, the player was tasked with assassinating an insane commander on a devastated starship.<ref name = "Next Gen">{{cite web | url = http://www.edge-online.com/magazine/the-making-of-system-shock-2 | title = The Making Of... System Shock 2 | author = ''Edge'' Staff | publisher = ''[[Next Generation Magazine]]'' | date = 2007-10-07 | accessdate = 2008-02-15}}</ref>

While the design was pitched to publishers, [[Electronic Arts]] contacted Irrational, suggesting they alter the game and make ''System Shock 2''. The development team agreed, and story changes were made to incorporate the ''Shock'' franchise.<ref name = "Next Gen"/> The project was allotted one year for development. To compensate for the short time frame, the development team began working with Looking Glass Studio's unfinished [[Dark Engine]].<ref name = "Gamasutra SS2">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/features/19991207/chey_01.htm | title = Postmortem: Irrational Games' System Shock 2 | author = Chey, Jonathan | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | date = 1999-12-07 | accessdate = 2008-02-16}}</ref>

Irrational wanted ''System Shock 2'' to include RPG elements, specifically a "combination of ''System Shock'' and ''Ultima Underworld''." Similar to ''[[Ultima Underworld]]'', another Looking Glass Studio project, the environment in ''System Shock 2'' is [[persistent world | persistent]] and constantly changes.<ref name = "IGN Interview 1">{{cite web | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/066/066813p1.html | title = Looking Glass Prepares To Shock Gamers Again | author = IGN Staff | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = 1999-02-09 | accessdate = 2008-02-15}}</ref><ref name = "SS2 Manual Designer Notes 2">{{cite book | title = System Shock 2 Instruction Manual | publisher = [[Electronic Arts]] | date = 1999-08-11 | pages = 40}}</ref> [[Paper and pencil game | Paper and pencil RPGs]] were also influential; the character customization system was based on ''[[Traveller (role-playing game) | Traveller's]]'' methodology. This design allowed multiple character paths and a more open-ended gameplay experience.<ref name = "IGN Interview">{{cite web | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/068/068509p1.html | title = System Shock 2 Interview 2 | author = IGN Staff | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = 1999-06-18 | accessdate = 2008-02-16}}</ref>

[[Horror and terror|Horror]] was a key focus and four major points were identified to successfully incorporate it. Isolation was primary, resulting in little physical contact with other sentient beings. The development team also felt vulnerability was a key factor. Instead of making the player very strong, they focused on a fragile character. The last two points were the inclusion of moody sound effects and "the intelligent placement of lighting and shadows".<ref name = "Gamespot retrospective SS2"/>

The game's lead designer, [[Ken Levine]], oversaw the return of ''System Shock'' villain, SHODAN. Part of Levine's design was to ally the player with SHODAN,<ref name = "Next Gen"/> but he also believed game characters were too trusting, stating "good guys are good, bad guys are bad. What you see and perceive is real." Levine challenged this notion by having SHODAN betray the player: "Sometimes characters are betrayed, but the ''player'' never is. I wanted to violate that trust and make the player feel that ''they'', and not [only] the character, were led on and deceived" This design choice was controversial with the development team.<ref name = "Gamespot Greatest Game"/>

Several problems were encountered during the development of ''System Shock 2''. Because the team comprised two software companies, negative tension existed regarding job assignments. Some developers left the project altogether, and many more were largely inexperienced. In a postmortem feature, Project manager Jonathan Chey reflected optimism, stating  "...inexperience also bred enthusiasm and commitment that might not have been present with a more jaded set of developers." The Dark Engine posed problems of its own. It lacked a defined [[Application Programming Interface | API]] and was unfinished, forcing the development team to fix software bugs when encountered. Sometimes working with the engine code was advantageous and allowed the development team to write additional engine features.<ref name = "Gamasutra SS2"/> One particular setback remained political when Irrational was asked to remove the guns from their [[E3]] demonstration after the recent [[Columbine High School massacre]].<ref name = "Gamespot retrospective SS2">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/features/6109881/index.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=newsfeatures&tag=newsfeatures;title;2 | title = System Shock 2 Retrospective | author = Park, Andrew | publisher = [[GameSpot]] | accessdate = 2008-02-19}}</ref>  

A [[Game demo| demo]] for the game, featuring a tutorial and a third of the first mission, was released on August 2, 1999.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/069/069257p1.html | title = System Shock 2 Demo Released | author = IGN Staff | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = 1999-08-02 | accessdate = 2008-02-16}}</ref> Nine days later, ''System Shock 2'' was shipped to retailers<ref>{{cite web | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/069/069487p1.html | title = News Briefs | author = IGN Staff | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = 1999-08-11 | accessdate = 2008-02-16}}</ref> and received acclaim from numerous critics.<ref name = "Metacritic SS2"/> The title took 18&nbsp;months to develop with a budget of $1.7&nbsp;million.<ref name = "Gamasutra SS2"/> A [[Patch (computing)| patch]] was released a month later and added significant features, such as [[Cooperative gameplay|co-operative multiplayer]] and control over weapon degradation and enemy [[Spawning (computer gaming)| respawn]] rates.<ref name = "ss2 patch">{{cite web | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/070/070556p1.html | title = Shock 2 2.0 | author = IGN Staff | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = 1999-09-17 | accessdate = 2008-02-16}}</ref> A port was planned for the [[Dreamcast]], but was subsequently canceled.<ref name = "ss2 dc canceled">{{cite web | url = http://dreamcast.ign.com/objects/014/014851.html | title = System Shock 2 (Dreamcast) | author = IGN Staff | publisher = [[IGN]] | accessdate = 2008-02-19}}</ref>

''System Shock 2'' received over a dozen awards, including seven "[[Game of the Year]]" awards by publications, such as [[Game Revolution]] and [[USA Today]].<ref name = "SS2 official awards">{{cite web | url = http://www.irrationalgames.com/shock2/ | title = System Shock 2 Official Website | publisher = [[Irrational Games]] | year = 2005 | accessdate = 2008-02-18}}</ref> Reviews were very positive and applauded the title for its hybrid gameplay, moody sound design, and engaging story.<ref name = "Metacritic SS2"/> Despite critical acclaim, the title failed to meet commercial sales expectations.<ref name = "1UP ss2"/> 

Many publications praised the title for its open-ended gameplay. With regard to character customization, [[IGN]] stated, <U+201C>The great thing about this system is that it allows you to play the game as completely different characters which gives the game an entirely different feel."<ref name = "IGN SS2 review"/> Erik Reckase writing for Just Adventure agreed, saying <U+201C>There are very few games that allow you [to] play the way you want to<U+201D>.<ref name = "JA ss2 review">{{cite web | url = http://www.justadventure.com/reviews/SS2/SS2.shtm | title = Review: System Shock 2 | author = Reckase, Erik | publisher = Just Adventure | accessdate = 2008-02-16}}</ref> Alec Norands of [[Allgame]] found the gameplay <U+201C>diverse enough to demand instant replayability.<ref name = "allgame ss2"/>

Critics described the game as quite frightening. Colin of [[Game Revolution]] attested that the game rivaled the terror of ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' and ''[[Silent Hill]]'', stating "this game is brimming with horror<U+201D>.<ref name = "GameRev SS2"/>  ''[[Computer and Video Games| CVG]]'' described the atmosphere as <U+201C>gripping<U+201D> and guaranteed readers they would "jump out of [their] skin on more than one occasion<U+201D>.<ref name = "cvg review"/> Norands found the [[sound design]] particularly effective, calling it <U+201C>absolutely, teeth-clenchingly disturbing,<U+201D><ref name = "allgame ss2"/> while ''[[PC Gamer]]'' editor, William Harms, christened ''System Shock 2'' <U+201C>the most unsettling and frightening game [he had] ever played.<U+201D><ref name = "pc gamer ss2"/>

One of the most common criticisms centered on the weapon degradation system, which causes weapons to wear out and eventually break through excessive use.

The RPG system was another point of contention.

''System Shock 2'' is regarded by some as highly influential, particularly on [[first-person shooter]]s. In a retrospective article, [[Gamespot]] declared the title "well ahead of its time" and stated it "upped the ante in dramatic and mechanical terms, creating an utterly engrossing, terrifying gameplay experience".
