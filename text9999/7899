'''John Ronald Reuel Tolkien''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (3 January 1892&nbsp;<U+2013> 2 September 1973), whose surname is pronounced {{nowrap|{{IPA-en|<U+02C8>t<U+0252>lki<U+02D0>n|}}<ref>See J.

Tolkien was [[Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon]] at [[Oxford University]] from 1925 to 1945 and [[Merton Professors|Merton Professor of English Language and Literature]] there from 1945 to 1959.<ref>''Biography'', pp. 111, 200, 266.</ref> He was a close friend of [[C.

Tolkien was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] by Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] on 28 March 1972.

After his death, Tolkien's son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]] published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including ''The Silmarillion''. These, together with ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about an imagined world called [[Arda]], and [[Middle-earth]]<ref>"Middle-earth" is derived from an Anglicized form of Old Norse [[Midgard|Mi<U+00F0>gar<U+00F0>r]], the land inhabited by humans in [[Norse mythology]].</ref> within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term ''[[legendarium]]'' to the larger part of these writings.<ref>''Letters'', nos. 131, 153, 154, 163.</ref>

==Biography==
===Tolkien family origins===
Most of Tolkien's paternal ancestors were craftsmen. The Tolkien family had its roots in [[Lower Saxony]], but had been living in England since the 18th century, becoming "quickly intensely English".<ref>''Letters'', no. 165.</ref> The surname ''Tolkien'' is said to come from the [[German language|German]] word ''tollk<U+00FC>hn''<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45548112.html |title=Ash nazg gimbatul |language=German |journal=[[Der Spiegel]] |issue=35/1969 |date=25 August 1969|quote=Professor Tolkien, der seinen Namen vom deutschen Wort 'tollk<U+00FC>hn' ableitet,... (lit.: Professor Tolkien who derives his name from the German word 'tollk<U+00FC>hn',... )}}</ref> ("foolhardy", etymologically corresponding to English ''dull-keen'', literally ''[[oxymoron]]''), and the surname ''Rashbold'', given to two characters in Tolkien's ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'', is similarly a [[compound word]] composed of two words with contrasting meanings.<ref>Undergraduate John Jethro Rashbold, and "old Professor Rashbold at Pembroke"; {{ME-ref|SD|page 151}}; ''Letters'', no. 165.</ref> German writers have suggested that in reality the name is more likely to derive from the village Tolkynen in Rastenburg in [[East Prussia]] (after WWII [[To<U+0142>kiny]], Poland). The name of that place is derived from the now extinct [[Old Prussian language]].<ref>Georg Gerullis: ''Die altpreu<U+00DF>ischen Ortsnamen'', o.V., Berlin/Leipzig 1922, S. 184.</ref><ref>Max Mechow: ''Deutsche Familiennamen prussischer Herkunft'', Tolkemita, Dieburg 1994, S. 99.</ref>

Tolkien's maternal grandparents, John and Edith Jane Suffield, were [[Baptists]] who lived in [[Birmingham]] and owned a shop in the city centre. The Suffield family had run various businesses out of the same building, called Lamb House, since the early 1800s. From 1810 Tolkien's great-great-grandfather William Suffield had a book and stationery shop there; from 1826 Tolkien's great-grandfather, also named John Suffield, had a [[drapery]] and [[hosiery]] business there.<ref>[http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ITEM_ID=46417&CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&MENU_ID=13150 Old Lamb House, Bull Street], Archives and Heritage Service, Birmingham City Council.

===Childhood===
John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892 in [[Bloemfontein]] in the [[Orange Free State]] (now [[Free State Province]], part of South Africa) to [[Arthur Tolkien|Arthur Reuel Tolkien]] (1857<U+2013>1896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, ''n<U+00E9>e'' Suffield (1870<U+2013>1904). The couple had left England when Arthur was promoted to head the Bloemfontein office of the British bank for which he worked. Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother, Hilary Arthur Reuel, who was born on 17 February 1894.<ref>''Biography'', p. 14.</ref>

As a child, Tolkien was bitten by a large [[baboon spider]] in the garden, an event which some think would have later echoes in his stories, although Tolkien admitted no actual memory of the event and no special hatred of spiders as an adult. In another incident, a family house-boy, who thought Tolkien a beautiful child, took the baby to his [[kraal]] to show him off, returning him the next morning.<ref>''Biography'', p. 13. Both the spider incident and the visit to a kraal are covered here.</ref>

When he was three, Tolkien went to England with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a lengthy family visit. His father, however, died in South Africa of [[rheumatic fever]] before he could join them.<ref>''Biography'', p. 24.</ref> This left the family without an income, and so Tolkien's mother took him to live with her parents in [[Kings Heath]],<ref>''Biography'', Ch I, "Bloemfontein". At 9 Ashfield Road, King's Heath.</ref> Birmingham. Soon after, in 1896, they moved to [[Sarehole]] (now in [[Hall Green]]), then a [[Worcestershire]] village, later annexed to Birmingham.<ref>''Biography'', p. 27.</ref> He enjoyed exploring [[Sarehole Mill]] and [[Moseley Bog]] and the [[Clent Hills|Clent]], [[Lickey Hills|Lickey]] and [[Malvern Hills]], which would later inspire scenes in his books, along with Worcestershire towns and villages such as [[Bromsgrove]], [[Alcester]], and [[Alvechurch]] and places such as his aunt Jane's farm of Bag End, the name of which would be used in his fiction.<ref>''Biography'', p. 113.</ref>

Mabel Tolkien herself taught her two sons, and Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen pupil.<ref>''Biography'', p. 29.</ref> She taught him a great deal of [[botany]] and awakened in him the enjoyment of the look and feel of plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of [[Latin]] very early.<ref name=DoughanBio>{{cite web|last=Doughan|first=David|year=2002|url=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/biography.html|title=JRR Tolkien Biography|work=Life of Tolkien|accessdate=12 March 2006}}</ref> He could read by the age of four and could write fluently soon afterwards. His mother allowed him to read many books. He disliked ''[[Treasure Island]]'' and ''[[The Pied Piper]]'' and thought ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]] was "amusing but disturbing". He liked stories about [[Native Americans in the United States|"Red Indians"]] and the fantasy works by [[George MacDonald]].<ref>''Biography'', p. 22.</ref> In addition, the "Fairy Books" of [[Andrew Lang]] were particularly important to him and their influence is apparent in some of his later writings.<ref>''Biography'', p. 30.</ref>

Tolkien attended [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]], and later [[St. Philip's School]], before winning a Foundation Scholarship and returning to King Edward's School. While a pupil at King Edward's School, he was one of a party of cadets from the school's Officers Training Corps who helped "line the route" for the [[coronation]] parade of King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], being posted just outside the gates of [[Buckingham Palace]].<ref name=Letters306>''Letters'', no. 306.</ref>

Mabel Tolkien was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1900 despite vehement protests by her Baptist family,<ref>''Biography'', p. 31.</ref> who then stopped all financial assistance to her. In 1904, when Tolkien was 12, she died of acute [[diabetes]] at Fern Cottage in [[Rednal]], which she was then renting. Mabel Tolkien was then about 34 years of age, about as old as a person with [[diabetes mellitus type 1]] could live with no treatment<U+2014>[[insulin]] would not be discovered until two decades later. Nine years after his mother's death, Tolkien wrote, "My own dear mother was a martyr indeed, and it is not to everybody that God grants so easy a way to his great gifts as he did to Hilary and myself, giving us a mother who killed herself with labour and trouble to ensure us keeping the faith."<ref>Carpenter, ''Biography'', page 31.</ref>

Prior to her death, Mabel Tolkien had assigned the guardianship of her sons to Fr. Francis Xavier Morgan of the [[Birmingham Oratory]], who was assigned to bring them up as good Catholics. Tolkien grew up in the [[Edgbaston]] area of Birmingham. He lived there in the shadow of [[Perrott's Folly]] and the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] tower of [[Edgbaston Waterworks]], which may have influenced the images of the dark towers within his works.<ref>[http://www.birminghamheritage.org.uk/tolkien.html J.R.R.

===Youth===
[[File:J. R. R. Tolkien (1911).png|thumb|right|Tolkien in 1911]]
In 1911, while they were at [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]], Tolkien and three friends, Rob Gilson, Geoffrey Smith, and Christopher Wiseman, formed a semi-secret society which they called "the T.C.B.S.", the initials standing for "Tea Club and Barrovian Society", alluding to their fondness for drinking tea in Barrow's Stores near the school and, secretly, in the school library.<ref>''Biography'', pp. 53<U+2013>54.</ref> After leaving school, the members stayed in touch, and in December 1914 they held a "Council" in London, at Wiseman's home. For Tolkien, the result of this meeting was a strong dedication to writing poetry.

In the summer of 1911, Tolkien went on holiday in Switzerland, a trip that he recollects vividly in a 1968 letter,<ref name=Letters306/> noting that [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s journey across the [[Misty Mountains]] ("including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine woods") is directly based on his adventures as their party of 12 hiked from [[Interlaken]] to [[Lauterbrunnen]] and on to camp in the [[moraine]]s <!-- Tolkien spells "morains", but this is not a direct quote. Oxford English Dictionary offers standardised spelling of "moraines".--> beyond [[M<U+00FC>rren]]. Fifty-seven years later, Tolkien remembered his regret at leaving the view of the eternal snows of [[Jungfrau]] and [[Silberhorn]] ("the Silvertine ([[Celebdil]]) of my dreams"). They went across the [[Kleine Scheidegg]] to [[Grindelwald]] and on across the [[Grosse Scheidegg]] to [[Meiringen]]. They continued across the [[Grimsel Pass]], through the upper [[Valais]] to [[Brig, Switzerland|Brig]] and on to the [[Aletsch glacier]] and [[Zermatt]].<ref>[http://maps.google.de/maps/user?uid=112792823367225913506&hl=de&gl=de dab], [http://maps.google.de/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=de&om=1&msa=0&msid=108471754903242205397.00000112a38e113bc84bd&ll=46.363988,8.055725&spn=0.843415,1.683655&t=k&z=9 Roots of Romance] (zoomed in on 1911 trail), hosted on [[Google Maps]]. Retrieved 28 April 2009.</ref>

In October of the same year, Tolkien began studying at [[Exeter College, Oxford]]. He initially studied [[Classics]] but changed to [[English Language]], graduating in 1915.

===Courtship and marriage===
At the age of 16, Tolkien met [[Edith Bratt|Edith Mary Bratt]], who was three years older, when he and his brother Hilary moved into the boarding house in which she lived. According to Humphrey Carpenter:
{{quote|Edith and Ronald took to frequenting Birmingham teashops, especially one which had a balcony overlooking the pavement. There they would sit and throw sugarlumps into the hats of passers-by, moving to the next table when the sugar bowl was empty. ... With two people of their personalities and in their position, romance was bound to flourish. Both were orphans in need of affection, and they found that they could give it to each other. During the summer of 1909, they decided that they were in love.<ref>''Biography'', p. 40.</ref>}}
His guardian, Father Francis Morgan, viewing Edith as a distraction from Tolkien's school work and horrified that his young charge was seriously involved with a [[Protestant]] girl, prohibited him from meeting, talking to, or even corresponding with her until he was 21. He obeyed this prohibition to the letter,<ref>{{cite web| last=Doughan|first=David| year=2002|url= http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/biography.html#2 | title=War, Lost Tales And Academia|work = J. R. R. Tolkien: A Biographical Sketch|accessdate = 12 March 2006}}</ref> with one notable early exception which made Father Morgan threaten to cut short his University career if he did not stop.<ref>''Biography'', p. 43.</ref>

On the evening of his twenty-first birthday, Tolkien wrote to Edith a declaration of his love and asked her to marry him. Edith replied saying that she had already agreed to marry another man, but that she had done so because she had believed Tolkien had forgotten her. The two met up and beneath a railway viaduct renewed their love; Edith returned her engagement ring and announced that she was marrying Tolkien instead.<ref>''Biography'', pp. 67<U+2013>69.</ref> Following their engagement Edith relunctantly announced that she was converting to Catholicism at Tolkien's insistence. Her landlord, a staunch [[Protestant]], was infuriated and evicted her as soon as she was able to find other lodgings.<ref>''Biography'', p. 73.</ref> Edith and Ronald were formally engaged in Birmingham, in January 1913, and married at [[Warwick, England|Warwick]], England, at Saint Mary Immaculate Catholic Church on 22 March 1916.<ref>''Biography'', p. 86.</ref>

===World War I===
In 1914, the United Kingdom entered [[World War I]] amidst an atmosphere of [[ultra-nationalism]]. As a result, Tolkien's relatives were shocked when he elected not to immediately volunteer for the [[British Army]]. Instead, Tolkien entered a program wherein he delayed enlisting until completing his degree in July 1915. He was then commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant]] in the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]].<ref>''Biography'', pp. 77-85.</ref> He trained with the 13th (Reserve) Battalion on [[Cannock Chase]], [[Staffordshire]], for eleven months. In a letter to Edith, Tolkien complained, "Gentlemen are rare among the superiors, and even human beings rare indeed."<ref>''Tolkien and the Great War'', page 94.</ref> Tolkien was then transferred to the 11th (Service) Battalion with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]], arriving in France on 4 June 1916. His departure from England on a troop transport inspired him to write his poem, ''The Lonely Isle''.<ref>Garth, John. ''Tolkien and the Great War'', Boston, Houghton Mifflin 2003, pp. 89, 138, 147.</ref> He later wrote, "Junior officers were being killed off, a dozen a minute. Parting from my wife then ... it was like a death."<ref>Quoted in John Garth, ''Tolkien and the Great War'', p. 138.</ref>

Tolkien served as a signals officer at the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Somme]], participating in the [[Battle of Thiepval Ridge]] and the subsequent assault on the [[Schwaben Redoubt]]. According to John Garth, however: <blockquote>Although [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]]'s army enshrined old social boundaries, it also chipped away at the class divide by throwing men from all walks of life into a desperate situation together. Tolkien wrote that the experience taught him, 'a deep sympathy and feeling for the [[Tommy Atkins|Tommy]]; especially the plain soldier from the agricultural counties.' He remained profoundly grateful for the lesson. For a long time, he had been imprisoned in a tower, not of pearl, but of ivory.<ref>John Garth, ''Tolkien and the Great War'', pages 94-95.</ref></blockquote>

Tolkien's time in combat was a terrible stress for Edith, who feared that every knock on the door might carry news of her husband's death. In order to get around the [[British Army]]'s [[postal censorship]], the Tolkiens had developed a secret code which accompanied his letters home. By using the code, Edith was able to track her husband's movements on a map of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].

On 27 October 1916 Tolkien came down with [[trench fever]], a disease carried by the [[lice]] which were common in the dugouts. According to the memoirs of the Reverend Mervyn S. Evers, [[Anglican]] chaplain to the Lancashire Fusiliers:
{{quote|On one occasion I spent the night with the Brigade Machine Gun Officer and the Signals Officer in one of the captured German dugouts ... We dossed down for the night in the hopes of getting some sleep, but it was not to be. We no sooner lay down than hordes of lice got up. So we went round to the Medical Officer, who was also in the dugout with his equipment, and he gave us some ointment which he assured us would keep the little brutes away. We anointed ourselves all over with the stuff and again lay down in great hopes, but it was not to be, because instead of discouraging them it seemed to act like a kind of ''[[hors d'oeuvre]]'' and the little beggars went at their feast with renewed vigour.<ref>Quoted in John Garth, ''Tolkien and the Great War'', p. 200.</ref>}}

Tolkien was invalided to England on 8 November 1916.<ref>''Biography'', p. 93.</ref> Many of his dearest school friends, including Gilson and Smith of the T.C.B.S., were killed in the war. In later years, Tolkien indignantly declared that those who searched his works for parallels to the Second World War were entirely mistaken:
{{quote|One has indeed personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression; but as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to be involved in 1939 and the following years. By 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead.<ref>''The Lord of the Rings''. Preface to the Second Edition.</ref>}}

====Homefront====
A weak and emaciated Tolkien spent the remainder of the war alternating between hospitals and garrison duties, being deemed medically unfit for general service.<ref>Garth, John. ''Tolkien and the Great War'', Boston, Houghton Mifflin 2003, pp. 207 ''et seq.''</ref><ref>Tolkien's [[Webley Revolver|Webley .455]] service revolver was put on display in 2006 as part of a [[Battle of the Somme]] exhibition in the [[Imperial War Museum]], London. (See {{cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.00o00200h |title=Personal Stories: John Ronald Reuel Tolkien |work = Battle of the Somme |publisher=Imperial War Museum |accessdate = 28 April 2009}}) Several of his service records, mostly dealing with his health problems, can be seen at the National Archives. ({{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/firstworldwar/people/tolkien.htm |title=Officer's service record: J R R Tolkien |work =First World War |publisher=National Archives |accessdate = 28 April 2009}})</ref>

During his recovery in a cottage in [[Great Haywood]], [[Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire]], he began to work on what he called ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', beginning with ''[[The Fall of Gondolin]]''. Throughout 1917 and 1918 his illness kept recurring, but he had recovered enough to do home service at various camps and was promoted to [[Lieutenant]]. It was at this time that Edith bore their first child, John Francis Reuel Tolkien.

When he was stationed at [[Kingston upon Hull]], he and Edith went walking in the woods at nearby [[Roos]], and Edith began to dance for him in a clearing among the flowering hemlock. After his wife's death in 1971, Tolkien remembered, <blockquote>I never called Edith ''Luthien'' <U+2013> but she was the source of the story that in time became the chief part of the ''Silmarillion''. It was first conceived in a small woodland glade filled with hemlocks<ref>Following rural English usage, Tolkien used the name "hemlock" for various plants with white flowers in umbels, resembling [[poison hemlock|hemlock]] (''Conium maculatum''); the flowers among which Edith danced were more probably [[cow parsley]] (''Anthriscus sylvestris'') or [[wild carrot]] (''Daucus carota''). See John Garth, ''Tolkien and the Great War'' (Harper Collins/Houghton Mifflin 2003), and Peter Gilliver, Jeremy Marshall, & Edmund Weiner, ''The Ring of Words'' (OUP 2006).</ref> at Roos in Yorkshire (where I was for a brief time in command of an outpost of the Humber Garrison in 1917, and she was able to live with me for a while). In those days her hair was raven, her skin clear, her eyes brighter than you have seen them, and she could sing <U+2013> and ''dance''. But the story has gone crooked, & I am left, and ''I'' cannot plead before the inexorable [[Mandos]].<ref>''Letters'', no. 340.</ref></blockquote>

This incident inspired the account of the meeting of [[Beren and L<U+00FA>thien]], and Tolkien often referred to Edith as "my L<U+00FA>thien".<ref>{{cite web|last=Cater|first=Bill|date=12 April 2001|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2001/12/04/batolk04.xml |title=We talked of love, death, and fairy tales|work =UK Telegraph|accessdate = 13 March 2006}}</ref>

===Academic and writing career===
Tolkien's first civilian job after World War I was at the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', where he worked mainly on the history and etymology of words of Germanic origin beginning with the letter ''W''.<ref>{{cite book|last= Gilliver| first=Peter|title=The Ring of Words: Tolkien and the OED|publisher=OUP| year=2006|coauthors=Jeremy Marshall and Edmund Weiner}}</ref> In 1920 he took up a post as [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in English Language at the [[University of Leeds]], and became the youngest professor there.<ref name="Grotta2001">{{cite book|author=Daniel Grotta|title=J.R.R.

He also translated ''Sir Gawain'', ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'', and ''[[Sir Orfeo]]''. In 1925 he returned to Oxford as [[Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon]], with a fellowship at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]].

During his time at Pembroke, Tolkien wrote ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and the first two volumes of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', whilst living at 20 [[Northmoor Road]] in [[North Oxford]] (where a [[blue plaque]] was placed in 2002). He also published a philological essay in 1932 on the name "[[Nodens]]", following Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]]'s unearthing of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Asclepieion]] at [[Lydney Park]], [[Gloucestershire]], in 1928.<ref>See ''The Name Nodens'' (1932) in the bibliographical listing. For the etymology, see [[Nodens#Etymology]].</ref>

====''Beowulf''====
Of Tolkien's academic publications, the 1936 lecture "[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics]]" had a lasting influence on ''[[Beowulf]]'' research.<ref>''Biography'', p. 143.</ref> Lewis E. Nicholson said that the article Tolkien wrote about ''Beowulf'' is "widely recognized as a turning point in Beowulfian criticism", noting that Tolkien established the primacy of the poetic nature of the work as opposed to its purely linguistic elements.<ref>{{cite web|last= Ramey|first=Bill| date= 30 March 1998|url= http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/billramey/beowulf.htm |title=The Unity of Beowulf: Tolkien and the Critics|work = Wisdom's Children|accessdate = 13 March 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060421094854/http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/billramey/beowulf.htm |archivedate = 21 April 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref> At the time, the consensus of scholarship deprecated ''Beowulf'' for dealing with childish battles with monsters rather than realistic tribal warfare; Tolkien argued that the author of ''Beowulf'' was addressing human destiny in general, not as limited by particular tribal politics, and therefore the monsters were essential to the poem.<ref>Tolkien: ''[[Finn and Hengest]]''. Chiefly, p.4 in the Introduction by [[Alan Bliss]].</ref> Where ''Beowulf'' does deal with specific tribal struggles, as at [[Finnsburg]], Tolkien argued firmly against reading in fantastic elements.<ref>Tolkien: ''[[Finn and Hengest]]'', the discussion of ''Eotena'', ''passim''.</ref> In the essay, Tolkien also revealed how highly he regarded Beowulf: "Beowulf is among my most valued sources," and this influence may be seen throughout his [[Middle-Earth]] [[legendarium]].<ref>{{cite web| last=Kennedy|first=Michael|year=2001|url= http://www.triode.net.au/~dragon/tilkal/issue1/beowulf.html |title=Tolkien and Beowulf&nbsp;<U+2013> Warriors of Middle-earth|work=Amon Hen|accessdate = 18 May 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060509110607/http://www.triode.net.au/~dragon/tilkal/issue1/beowulf.html |archivedate = 9 May 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

According to [[Humphrey Carpenter]], Tolkien had an ingenious means of beginning his series of lectures on ''Beowulf'': <blockquote>He would come silently into the room, fix the audience with his gaze, and suddenly begin to declaim in a resounding voice the opening lines of the poem in the original Anglo-Saxon, commencing with a great cry of ''Hw<U+00E6>t!'' (The first word of this and several other Old English poems), which some undergraduates took to be 'Quiet!' It was not so much a recitation as a dramatic performance, an impersonation of an Anglo-Saxon bard in a mead hall, and it impressed generations of students because it brought home to them that ''Beowulf'' was not just a set text to be read for the purposes of examination, but a powerful piece of dramatic poetry.<ref name=autogenerated1>Carpenter, ''Biography'', page 133.</ref></blockquote>

More than a quarter century after his death, Tolkien's handwritten translation of and commentary on ''Beowulf'', running to roughly 2000 pages, was discovered in the archives of the [[Bodleian Library]].<ref>"The Data File: 'New' Tolkien Book," [[Locus (magazine)|Locus]], Fwbruary 2003, p.85.</ref>

====World War II====
In the run-up to [[World War II]], Tolkien was earmarked as a [[Cryptanalysis|codebreaker]].<ref name ="spy1">''Letters'', no. 35 (see also editorial note).</ref><ref name ="spy3">{{cite book|first1=Wayne|last1=Hammond|author1-link=Wayne Hammond|first2=Christina|last2=Scull|author2-link=Christina Scull|title=[[The J.

In 1945, Tolkien moved to [[Merton College, Oxford]], becoming the [[Merton Professors|Merton Professor of English Language and Literature]],<ref name="Grotta2001">{{cite book|author=Daniel Grotta|title=J.R.R. Tolkien Architect of Middle Earth|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9LHQvq6P5qIC&pg=PA110|accessdate=22 August 2010|date=28 March 2001|publisher=Running Press|isbn=9780762409563|pages=110<U+2013>}}</ref> in which post he remained until his retirement in 1959. He served as an external examiner for [[University College, Dublin]], for many years. In 1954 Tolkien received an honorary degree from the National University of Ireland (of which U.C.D. was a constituent college). Tolkien completed ''The Lord of the Rings'' in 1948, close to a decade after the first sketches.

Tolkien also helped to translate the ''[[Jerusalem Bible]]'', which was published in 1966.<ref>Rogerson, John. ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the Bible'', 2001.</ref>

===Family===
The Tolkiens had four children: John Francis Reuel Tolkien (17 November 1917&nbsp;<U+2013> 22 January 2003), Michael Hilary Reuel Tolkien (22 October 1920&nbsp;<U+2013> 27 February 1984), [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher John Reuel Tolkien]] (born 21 November 1924) and Priscilla Mary Anne Reuel Tolkien (born 18 June 1929). Tolkien was very devoted to his children and sent them illustrated [[The Father Christmas Letters|letters from Father Christmas]] when they were young. Each year more characters were added, such as the Polar Bear (Father Christmas's helper), the Snow Man (his gardener), Ilbereth the elf (his secretary), and various other, minor characters. The major characters would relate tales of Father Christmas's battles against [[goblin]]s who rode on bats and the various pranks committed by the Polar Bear.<ref>J. R. R. Tolkien, [[The Father Christmas Letters]] (1976)</ref>

===Friendships===
====C. S. Lewis====
[[C. S. Lewis]], whom Tolkien first met at Oxford, was perhaps his closest friend and colleague, although their relationship cooled later in their lives. They had a shared affection for good talk, laughter, and beer, and in May 1927 Tolkien enrolled Lewis in the "Coalbiters",<ref>''Biography'', pp. 119<U+2013>20.</ref> a club which read Icelandic sagas in the original [[Old Norse]]. As a result, "a long and complex friendship had begun." It was Tolkien and [[Hugo Dyson]] who persuaded Lewis convert to Christianity from Atheism, and Tolkien was accustomed to read aloud passages from his Silmarillion mythology, ''The Hobbit'', and ''The Lord of the Rings'' while Lewis listened.

Tolkien later recalled, <blockquote>"The unpayable debt I owe to him was not 'influence' as it is ordinarily understood, but sheer encouragement. He was for long my only audience. Only from him did I ever get the idea that my 'stuff' could be more than a private hobby."<ref>''Biography'', page 148.</ref></blockquote> 

Lewis's growing reputation as a Christian apologist and his return to the Anglicanism of his childhood seriously bothered Tolkien. After Lewis published the story of his conversion under the title, [[The Pilgrim's Regress]], Tolkien complained, <blockquote>"Lewis would regress. He would not enter Christianity by a new door, but by the old one: at least in the sense that in taking it up again he would also take up again, or reawaken, the prejudices so sedulously planted in childhood and boyhood. He would become again a [[Northern Ireland]] protestant."<ref>''Biography'', page 151.</ref></blockquote>

By the mid-[[1940s]], Tolkien felt that Lewis was receiving, "too much [publicity] for his or any of our tastes".<ref>''Biography'', p. 151.</ref>

It was the arrival of [[Charles Williams (UK writer)|Charles Williams]], who worked for Oxford University Press, that changed the relationship between Tolkien and Lewis. Lewis's enthusiasm shifted almost imperceptibly from Tolkien to Williams, especially during the writing of Lewis's third novel ''[[That Hideous Strength]]''.

However, Lewis's skepticism over the [[Second Spanish Republic]]'s [[Anti-Catholic]] [[pogrom]]s seriously offended Tolkien. In a 1944 letter to his son Christopher, he wrote:
{{quote| But hatred of our church is after all the real only final foundation of the C[hurch] of E[ngland]<U+2014>so deep laid that it remains even when all the superstructure seems removed (C.S.L. for instance reveres the [[Blessed Sacrament]], and admires nuns!). Yet if a [[Lutheran]] is put in jail he is up in arms; but if Catholic [[Red Terror (Spain)|priests are slaughtered]] <U+2014> he disbelieves it (and I daresay really thinks they asked for it).<ref name="Letters83"/>}}

According to [[Humphrey Carpenter]], <blockquote>"...he and Lewis might conceivably have preserved something of their old friendship had not Tolkien been puzzled and even angered by Lewis' marriage to [[Joy Davidman]], which lasted from 1957 to her death in 1960. Some of his feelings might be explained by the fact that she had been divorced from her previous husband before she married Lewis, some by resentment of Lewis' expectation that his friends should pay court to his new wife -- whereas in the thirties Lewis, very much the bachelor, had liked to ignore the fact that his friends had wives to go home to. But there was more to it than that. It was almost as if Tolkien felt betrayed by the marriage, resented the intrusion of a woman into his friendship with Lewis -- just as Edith had resented Lewis' intrusion into her marriage. Ironically, it was Edith who became friends with Joy Davidman."</blockquote><ref>''Biography'', p. 237.</ref> In a 1964 letter, Tolkien described the marriage as "very strange".<ref>''Letters'', 267.</ref><ref>Carpenter, Humphrey. ''The Inklings'', Unwin Paperbacks, 1981, p. 242.</ref>

The cessation of Tolkien's frequent meetings with Lewis in the 1950s marked the end of the "clubbable" chapter in Tolkien's life, which started with the T.C.B.S. at school and ended with the Inklings at Oxford.

His friendship with Lewis was nevertheless renewed to some degree in later years. During Lewis' last illness, Tolkien approached his friend's stepson, [[Douglas Gresham]], and offered him a place to stay. After Lewis's death in November 1963, Tolkien wrote to his daughter Priscilla: "So far I have felt the normal feelings of a man of my age<U+2014>like an old tree that is losing all its leaves one by one: this feels like an axe-blow near the roots."<ref>''Biography'', p. 241.</ref><ref>The relationship between Tolkien, Lewis, and Williams, fictionalized, is at the centre of James A. Owens' ''Here, There be Dragons'' ([[2007 in literature|2007]]).</ref>

====W. H. Auden====
[[W. H. Auden]], who had spent much of his life as an avowed [[Marxist]], began corresponding with Tolkien during the mid-1950s. By this time, Auden had broken with his former beliefs and returned to the Anglicanism of his childhood. They remained close friends for the remainder of Tolkien's life. In one letter, Auden recalled, <blockquote>"I don't think I have ever told you what an unforgettable experience it was for me as an undergraduate, hearing you recite [[Beowulf]]. The voice was the voice of [[Gandalf]]."<ref name=autogenerated1 /></blockquote>

In addition, Auden was among the most prominent literary critics to praise ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien wrote in a 1971 letter:
{{quote|I am [...] very deeply in Auden's debt in recent years. His support of me and interest in my work has been one of my chief encouragements. He gave me very good reviews, notices and letters from the beginning when it was by no means a popular thing to do. He was, in fact, sneered at for it.<ref>''Letters'', no. 327.</ref>}}

====Roy Campbell====
At a meeting of the Inklings in October 1944, Tolkien met and was charmed by the [[South Africa]]n poet and Roman Catholic convert [[Roy Campbell (poet)|Roy Campbell]], who had been discharged from the [[King's African Rifles]] after being severely injured in a motorcycle accident. Campbell had been active as a [[war correspondent]] with [[Francisco Franco]]'s Nationalists during the [[Spanish Civil War]], although he had not served in his armies.<ref>Pearce, Joseph. ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf''. Wilmington, Delaware: ISI Books, 2004. pp. 269-272</ref><ref>Christopher Othen, ''[[Franco's International Brigades: Foreign Volunteers and Fascist Dictators in the Spanish Civil War]]'', (Destino, 2007) p. 107</ref> Campbell vividly described to Tolkien and Lewis Republican atrocities which he had witnessed<ref>[[Joseph Pearce]], ''Literary Giants, Literary Catholics'', page 197.</ref> including the massacre of 17 [[Carmelite]] monks in Toledo by [[Marxist]] [[death squads]].<ref>''Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien'', letter 83.</ref>

In Campbell's eyes, the Spanish Civil War was an uncomplicated battle between the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and [[Stalinism]]. Tolkien, who shared his opinion, admiringly compared Campbell to the Ranger [[Aragorn]] from his [[Middle Earth]] [[legendarium]]. C. S. Lewis did not agree with Campbell's assessment of the Civil War, and had composed poetry attacking what he referred to as the latter's, "mixture of Catholicism and [[Fascism]]".<ref name="Letters83"/><ref>C. S. Lewis: "To the Author of Flowering Rifle", ''The Cherwell'', 6 May 1939</ref> In his poem, "To the Author of Flowering Rifle", Lewis had declared, 
:''--Who cares''
:''Which kind of shirt the murdering Party wears?''<ref>''Joseph Pearce, ''Literary Giants, Literary Catholics'', [[Ignatius Press]], 2005. Page 236.</ref>

During the evening, Lewis, who had consumed several glasses of [[Porter (beer)|porter]], insisted on reading his poem aloud while Campbell laughed off the provocation.<ref name="Letters83"/> Describing the evening in a letter to his son Christopher, Tolkien accused Lewis of carrying residual [[anti-Catholicism]] from his upbringing in [[Northern Ireland]].<ref name="Letters83"/> Eventually, however, Lewis and Campbell patched up their differences.<ref>Joseph Pearce, ''Literary Giants, Literary Catholics'', pages 235-239.</ref> Campbell joined the Inklings at the [[The Eagle and Child]] several times before moving to [[Portugal]] in 1946.<ref>Carpenter, Humphrey (1978). The Inklings. Allen & Unwin. ISBN 0007748698, p. 191-192.</ref>

===Retirement and old age===
During his life in retirement, from 1959 up to his death in 1973, Tolkien received steadily increasing public attention and literary fame. The sales of his books were so profitable that he regretted he had not chosen early retirement.<ref name=DoughanBio/> While at first he wrote enthusiastic answers to readers' enquiries, he became more and more bothered by the emerging [[Tolkien fandom]], especially among the [[hippie]] movement in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Meras|first=Phyllis|date=15 January 1967|url= http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-gandalf.html |title="Go, Go, Gandalf"|work = New York Times|accessdate = 12 March 2006}}</ref> In a 1972 letter he deplored having become a [[Tolkien fandom|cult-figure]], but admitted that "even the nose of a very modest idol [...] cannot remain entirely untickled by the sweet smell of incense!"<ref>''Letters'', no. 336.</ref></blockquote>

Fan attention became so intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number out of the public directory<ref>''Letters'', no. 332.</ref> and eventually he and Edith moved to [[Bournemouth]], which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British upper class. Although Tolkien's status as a bestselling author gave them easy entry into polite society, Tolkien deeply missed the company of his fellow intellectuals. Edith, however, was overjoyed to step into the role of a society hostess, which was the reason Tolkien selected Bournemouth in the first place.

According to [[Humphrey Carpenter]], <blockquote>Those friends who knew Ronald and Edith Tolkien over the years never doubted that there was deep affection between them. It was visible in the small things, the almost absurd degree in which each worried about the other's health, and the care in which they chose and wrapped each other's birthday presents'; and in the large matters, the way in which Ronald willingly abandoned such a large part of his life in retirement to give Edith the last years in [[Bournemouth]] that he felt she deserved, and the degree in which she showed pride in his fame as an author. A principal source of happiness to them was their shared love of their family. This bound them together until the end of their lives, and it was perhaps the strongest force in the marriage. They delighted to discuss and mull over every detail of the lives of their children, and later their grandchildren.<ref>Humphrey Carpenter, "Tolkien: The Authorized Biography," page 158.</ref></blockquote>

Tolkien was appointed by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] a Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in the [[New Year's Honours List]] of 1 January 1972<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=45554 |date=1 January 1972 |startpage=9 |endpage= |supp=yes |accessdate=2008-07-31}}</ref> and received the insignia of the Order at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 28 March 1972.<ref>''Letters'', no. 334 (editorial note).</ref>

===Death===
[[File:Tolkiengrab.jpg|thumb|The grave of J. R. R. and [[Edith Tolkien]], [[Wolvercote Cemetery]], [[Oxford]]]]
Tolkien's wife, Edith, died on 29 November 1971, at the age of 82.<ref name="NYTimes obit">{{cite news |title=J. R. R.

==Views==
Tolkien was a devout Roman Catholic, and in his religious and political views he was mostly conservative, in the sense of favouring established conventions and orthodoxies over innovation and modernization; in 1943 he wrote, "My political opinions lean more and more to [[Anarchy]] ([[philosophical anarchism|philosophically understood]], meaning abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs)<U+2014>or to 'unconstitutional' [[monarchism|Monarchy]]."<ref>''Letters'', no. 52, to Christopher Tolkien, 29 November 1943</ref>

Tolkien had an intense dislike for the side effects of [[industrialization]], which he considered to be devouring the English countryside. For most of his adult life, he was disdainful of [[cars]], preferring to ride a bicycle.<ref>''Letters'', nos. 64, 131, etc.</ref> This attitude can be seen in his work, most famously in the portrayal of the forced "industrialization" of the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]] in ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>{{cite video | title = J. R. R. Tolkien&nbsp;<U+2013> Creator Of Middle Earth | publisher = [[New Line Cinema]] | format = DVD |date = 2002}}</ref>

Many commentators<ref name=MEreffotrForeword>{{ME-ref|fotr|Foreword}}</ref> have remarked on a number of potential parallels between the Middle-earth saga and events in Tolkien's lifetime. ''The Lord of the Rings'' is often thought to represent England during and immediately after World War II. Tolkien ardently rejected this opinion in the foreword to the second edition of the novel, stating he preferred applicability to allegory.<ref name=MEreffotrForeword/> This theme is taken up at greater length in his essay "[[On Fairy-Stories]]", where he argues that fairy-stories are so apt because they are consistent both within themselves and with some truths about reality. He concludes that Christianity itself follows this pattern of inner consistency and external truth. His belief in the fundamental truths of Christianity leads commentators to find Christian themes in ''The Lord of the Rings.'' Tolkien objected strongly to C. S. Lewis's use of religious references in his stories, which were often overtly allegorical.<ref>Longenecker, Dwight. [http://www.speroforum.com/a/16698/Why-Tolkien-said-No-to-Narnia Why Tolkien said No to Narnia], Spero News, 12 November 2008. Accessed 4 April 2009.</ref> However, Tolkien wrote that the Mount Doom scene exemplified lines from the [[Lord's Prayer]].<ref>Pearce, Joseph (2003).

Accessed 1 December 2008.</ref>

His love of myths and his devout faith came together in his assertion that he believed that [[mythology]] is the divine echo of "the Truth".<ref>Wood, Ralph C. [http://www.leaderu.com/humanities/wood-biography.html Biography of J. R. R. Tolkien (1892<U+2013>1973)]. Addison, Texas; Leadership University. Updated 13 July 2002. Retrieved 28 April 2009.</ref> This view was expressed in his poem ''[[Mythopoeia (poem)|Mythopoeia]]'',<ref>Tolkien, Mythopoeia (the poem), circa 1931.</ref> and his idea that myths held "fundamental truths" became a central theme of the [[Inklings]] in general.

===Religion===
Tolkien's devout faith was a significant factor in the conversion of [[C. S. Lewis]] from atheism to Christianity, although Tolkien was dismayed that Lewis chose to join the [[Church of England]].<ref name="CSL">{{cite book|last=Carpenter|first=Humphrey|year=1978|title=The Inklings|publisher=Allen & Unwin|isbn=0007748698}} Lewis was brought up in the [[Church of Ireland]].</ref>

In the last years of his life, Tolkien became greatly [[Traditionalist Catholic|disappointed]] by the reforms and changes implemented after the [[Second Vatican Council]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Craven |first=R. Kenton |year=2001 |title=Catholic Poem in Time of War: The Lord of the Rings |url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/arts/al0127.html |work=Catholic Education Resource Center |accessdate=28 April 2009}} Reprinted from ''True West''. "Tolkien himself&nbsp;<U+2013> as did Evelyn Waugh&nbsp;<U+2013> abhorred the changes in the Mass and the prevailing Catholic mind."</ref> as his grandson [[Simon Tolkien]] recalls: <blockquote>I vividly remember going to church with him in [[Bournemouth]]. He was a devout Roman Catholic and it was soon after the Church had changed the [[liturgy]] from Latin to English. My grandfather obviously didn't agree with this and made all the responses very loudly in Latin while the rest of the congregation answered in English. I found the whole experience quite excruciating, but my grandfather was oblivious. He simply had to do what he believed to be right.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.simontolkien.com/jrrtolkien.html|title=My Grandfather |first=Simon |last=Tolkien|publisher=[[The Mail on Sunday]] |date=23 February 2003 |accessdate=27 April 2009|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080422072235/http://www.simontolkien.com/jrrtolkien.html |archivedate = April 22, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref></blockquote>

===Politics and race===
====Anti-communism====
Tolkien voiced support for [[Francisco Franco]]'s Nationalists during the [[Spanish Civil War]] upon hearing that [[Soviet Army|Soviet]]-trained<ref>Donald Rayfield, ''Stalin and his Hangmen: The Tyrant and Those Who Killed for Him'', [[Random House]], 2004. Pages 362-363.</ref></blockquote> [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] [[death squads#Spain|death squads]] were destroying churches and [[Red Terror (Spain)|murdering large numbers of priests and nuns]].<ref name="Letters83">''Letters'', no. 83.</ref>

At a time when many Western writers and intellectuals openly admired [[Stalin]], Tolkien made no effort to hide his contempt for the [[dictator]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. Even during World War II, when Britain was allied with the [[USSR]], Tolkien referred to Stalin as "that bloodthirsty old murderer"<ref>''Letters'', no. 53.</ref> and expressed hope that the Americans would overthrow him after Hitler's defeat.

However, in 1961, Tolkien sharply criticized a Swedish commentator who suggested that ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' was an anti-communist [[parable]] and identified the Dark Lord with Stalin. Tolkien retorted that his [[Middle-earth]] [[legendarium]] was conceived long before the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. He indignantly added, "Such an [[allegory]] is entirely foreign to my thought."<ref>''Letters'', no. 230.</ref>

====Debate over race====
The question of [[racism|racist]] or [[racialism|racialist]] elements in Tolkien's views and works has been the matter of some scholarly debate.<ref>Jensen, Steuard. [http://tolkien.slimy.com/faq/External.html#Racist Was Tolkien a racist? Were his works?], ''Tolkien Meta-FAQ'', III. A. 7. Retrieved on 27 April 2009.</ref>
Christine Chism<ref>''[[J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'' (2006), s.v. "Racism, Charge of", p. 557.</ref> distinguishes accusations as falling into three categories: intentional racism,<ref>John Yatt, The Guardian (2 December 2002), writes: "White men are good, 'dark' men are bad, orcs are worst of all." (Other critics such as [[Tom Shippey]] and [[Michael D.C. Drout]] disagree with such clear-cut generalizations of Tolkien's "white" and "dark" men into good and bad.) Tolkien's works have also been embraced by self-admitted racists such as the [[British National Party]].</ref> unconscious [[Eurocentric]] bias, and an evolution from latent racism in Tolkien's early work to a conscious rejection of racist tendencies in his late work.

Tolkien expressed disgust at what he acknowledged as racism and once wrote of [[South Africa under apartheid|racial segregation]] in South Africa, "The treatment of colour nearly always horrifies anyone going out from Britain."<ref>''Letters'', no. 61, to Christopher Tolkien, 18 April 1944.</ref>

====Opposition to Nazism====
Tolkien vocally opposed [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] prior to the [[Second World War]]. In 1938, the publishing house [[R<U+00FC>tten & Loening Verlag]] was preparing to release ''The Hobbit'' in [[Nazi Germany]]. To Tolkien's outrage, he was asked beforehand whether he was of [[Aryan race|Aryan]] origin. In a letter to his British publisher [[Stanley Unwin (publisher)|Stanley Unwin]], he condemned [[Nazism|Nazi]] "race-doctrine" and [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] as "wholly pernicious and unscientific". He added that he had many Jewish friends and was considering, "letting a German translation go hang".<ref>''Letters'', no. 29, to Stanley Unwin, 25 July 1938.</ref> He provided two letters to R<U+00FC>tten & Loening and instructed Unwin to send whichever he preferred. The more tactful letter was sent and was lost during the later bombing of Germany. In the unsent letter, Tolkien makes the point that "Aryan" is a linguistic term, denoting speakers of [[Indo-Iranian languages]]. He continued,
<blockquote> But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of ''Jewish'' origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have ''no'' ancestors of that gifted people. My great-great-grandfather came to England in the eighteenth century from Germany: the main part of my descent is therefore purely English, and I am an English subject<U+2014>which should be sufficient. I have been accustomed, nonetheless, to regard my German name with pride, and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war, in which I served in the English army. I cannot, however, forbear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature, then the time is not far distant when a German name will no longer be a source of pride.<ref>''Letters'', no. 30.</ref>
</blockquote>

In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, he expressed his resentment at the distortion of Germanic history in "Nordicism":
<blockquote>
...  that ruddy little ignoramus Adolf Hitler ... Ruining, perverting, misapplying, and making for ever accursed, that noble northern spirit, a supreme contribution to Europe, which I have ever loved, and tried to present in its true light. Nowhere, incidentally, was it nobler than in England, nor more early sanctified and Christianized.<ref>''Letters'', no. 45.</ref>
</blockquote>

In 1968, he objected to a description of Middle-earth as "[[Nordic race|Nordic]]", a term he said he disliked because of its association with [[Nordic theory|racialist theories]].<ref>''Letters'', no. 294.</ref>

====Total war====
Tolkien criticised Allied use of [[total war]] tactics against civilians from [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Imperial Japan]]. In a 1945 letter to his son Christopher, he wrote:
<blockquote>
We were supposed to have reached a stage of civilization in which it might still be necessary to execute a criminal, but not to gloat, or to hang his wife and child by him while the orc-crowd hooted. The destruction of Germany, be it 100 times merited, is one of the most appalling world-catastrophes. Well, well,<U+2014>you and I can do nothing about it. And that [should] be a measure of the amount of guilt that can justly be assumed to attach to any member of a country who is not a member of its actual Government. Well the first War of the Machines seems to be drawing to its final inconclusive chapter<U+2014>leaving, alas, everyone the poorer, many bereaved or maimed and millions dead, and only one thing triumphant: the Machines.<ref>''Letters'', no. 96.</ref>
</blockquote>

He also reacted with anger at the excesses of [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]] propaganda during the war. In 1944, he wrote in a letter to his son Christopher:
<blockquote>
... it is distressing to see the press grovelling in the gutter as low as [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] in his prime, shrieking that any German commander who holds out in a desperate situation (when, too, the military needs of his side clearly benefit) is a drunkard, and a besotted fanatic. ... There was a solemn article in the local paper seriously advocating systematic exterminating of the entire German nation as the only proper course after military victory: because, if you please, they are [[rattlesnake]]s, and don't know the difference between good and evil! (What of the writer?) The Germans have just as much right to declare the [[Poles]] and Jews exterminable vermin, [[Untermensch|subhuman]], as we have to select the Germans: in other words, no right, whatever they have done.<ref>''Letters'', no. 81.</ref>
</blockquote>

He was horrified by the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], referring to the scientists of the [[Manhattan Project]] as "these lunatic physicists" and "[[Tower of Babel|Babel]]-builders".<ref name="atom">''Letters'', no. 102.</ref>

==Writing==
Beginning with ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', written while recuperating from illnesses contracted during [[The Battle of the Somme]], Tolkien devised several themes that were reused in successive drafts of his ''[[legendarium]]''. The two most prominent stories, the tale of [[Beren and L<U+00FA>thien]] and that of [[T<U+00FA>rin]], were carried forward into long narrative poems (published in ''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]'').

===Influences===
{{Main|J. R. R. Tolkien's influences}}

====British adventure stories====
One of the greatest influences on Tolkien was the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] [[polymath]] [[William Morris]]. Tolkien wished to imitate Morris's prose and poetry romances,<ref>''Letters'', no. 1.</ref> from which, along with some general aspects of approach, he took hints for the names of features such as the Dead Marshes in ''The Lord of the Rings''<ref>''Letters'', no. 226.</ref> and Mirkwood.<ref>Anderson, Douglas A. ''The Annotated Hobbit'', Boston, Houghton Mifflin 1988, p. 183, note 10.</ref>

[[Edward Wyke-Smith]]'s ''The Marvellous Land of Snergs'', with its "table-high" title characters, strongly influenced the incidents, themes, and depiction of Bilbo's race in ''The Hobbit''.<ref>Anderson, Douglas A. ''The Annotated Hobbit'', Boston, Houghton Mifflin 1988, pp. 6<U+2013>7.</ref>

Tolkien also cited [[Henry Rider Haggard|H. Rider Haggard]]'s novel ''[[She (novel)|She]]'' in a telephone interview: "I suppose as a boy ''She'' interested me as much as anything<U+2014>like the Greek shard of Amyntas [Amenartas], which was the kind of machine by which everything got moving."<ref>{{cite journal | last = Resnick | first = Henry | year = 1967 | title = An Interview with Tolkien | journal = [[Niekas]] | pages = 37<U+2013>47}}</ref> A supposed facsimile of this [[potsherd]] appeared in Haggard's first edition, and the ancient inscription it bore, once translated, led the English characters to She's ancient kingdom.

Tolkien wrote of being impressed as a boy by [[Samuel Rutherford Crockett|S. R. Crockett]]'s historical novel ''The Black Douglas'' and of basing the Necromancer ([[Sauron]]) on its villain, [[Gilles de Retz]].<ref>''Letters'', p. 391, footnote, quoted in Jared C.

''The World of the Rings: Language, Religion, and Adventure in Tolkien'', pp. 6<U+2013>7.</ref>

====European mythology====
Tolkien was much inspired by early [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], especially [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] literature, [[Germanic poetry|poetry]], and [[Germanic paganism|mythology]], which were his chosen and much-loved areas of expertise. These sources of inspiration included [[Anglo-Saxon literature]] such as ''[[Beowulf]]'', [[Saga|Norse sagas]] such as the ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' and the ''[[Hervarar saga]]'',<ref>As described by Christopher Tolkien in ''Hervarar Saga ok Heidreks Konung'' (Oxford University, Trinity College). B. Litt. thesis. 1953/4. [Year uncertain], ''The Battle of the Goths and the Huns'', in: Saga-Book (University College, London, for the Viking Society for Northern Research) 14, part 3 (1955<U+2013>6) [http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/bibl4.html]</ref> the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', and numerous other culturally related works.<ref name=DayTolkiensRing>{{cite book|first=David|last=Day|authorlink=David Day (Canadian)|date=1 February 2002|title=[[Tolkien's Ring]]|location = New York|publisher=Barnes and Noble|isbn = 1-58663-527-1}}</ref> Despite the similarities of his work to the ''Volsunga saga'' and the ''Nibelungenlied'', which were the basis for [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', Tolkien dismissed critics' direct comparisons to Wagner, telling his publisher, "Both rings were round, and there the resemblance ceases." However, some critics<ref>[http://www.wagner-dc.org/haymes04_lec.html The Two Rings<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=April 2009}}</ref><ref>[[Spengler (pseudonym)|Spengler]], [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/EA11Aa02.html The 'Ring' and the remnants of the West], ''Asia Times'', 11 January 2003.

Retrieved on 27 April 2009.</ref> Two of the characteristics possessed by the One Ring, its inherent malevolence and corrupting power upon minds and wills, were not present in the mythical sources but have a central role in Wagner's opera.

Tolkien did also acknowledge several non-Germanic influences or sources for some of his stories and ideas, including [[Homer]], [[Sophocles]], and the Finnish and [[Karelian]] national epic, the ''[[Kalevala]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Handwerk|first=Brian|date=1 March 2004|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/12/1219_tolkienroots.html| title=Lord of the Rings Inspired by an Ancient Epic|work = National Geographic News|accessdate = 13 March 2006}}</ref> [[Dimitra Fimi]], [[Douglas A. Anderson]], [[John Garth]], and many other prominent Tolkien scholars believe that Tolkien also drew influence from a variety of [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]]  [[Irish mythology|Irish]], ([[Scottish mythology|Scottish]] and [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]]) history and legends.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Fimi | first = Dimitra | year = 2006 | title = 'Mad' Elves and 'elusive beauty': some Celtic strands of Tolkien's mythology | journal = Folklore | volume = 117 | issue = 2 | pages = 156<U+2013>170 | publisher = West Virginia University Press | issn = 1547-3155 | doi = 10.1353/tks.2007.0015 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2386/is_2_117/ai_n16676591 | accessdate = 27 April 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Fimi | first = Dimitra | year = 2007 | title = Tolkien's "'Celtic' type of legends": Merging Traditions | journal = Tolkien Studies | volume = 4 | pages = 51<U+2013>71 | publisher = West Virginia University Press | issn = 1547-3155 | doi = 10.1353/tks.2007.0015 | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/tolkien_studies/v004/4.1fimi.html | accessdate = 25 April 2009}}</ref> However, after the ''Silmarillion'' manuscript was rejected, in part for its "eye-splitting" Celtic names, Tolkien denied their Celtic origin:
{{quote|Needless to say they are not Celtic! Neither are the tales. I do know Celtic things (many in their original languages Irish and Welsh), and feel for them a certain distaste: largely for their fundamental unreason. They have bright colour, but are like a broken stained glass window reassembled without design. They are in fact 'mad' as your reader says<U+2014>but I don't believe I am.<ref>''Letters'', no. 19.</ref><ref name="letter144"/>}}

====Catholicism====
Catholic theology and imagery played a part in fashioning Tolkien's creative imagination, suffused as it was by his deeply religious spirit.<ref name=DayTolkiensRing/><ref>{{cite web|last=Bofetti|first=Jason|month=November | year=2001|url= http://www.crisismagazine.com/november2001/feature7.htm |title=Tolkien's Catholic Imagination|work = Crisis Magazine|accessdate = 30 August 2006}}</ref> Tolkien acknowledged this himself:
{{quote|''The Lord of the Rings'' is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work; unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision. That is why I have not put in, or have cut out, practically all references to anything like 'religion', to cults or practices, in the imaginary world. For the religious element is absorbed into the story and the symbolism.<ref>''Letters'', no. 142.</ref>}}

Specifically, [[Paul H. Kocher]] argues that Tolkien describes evil in the orthodox Christian way as the absence of good. He cites many examples in ''The Lord of the Rings'', such as Sauron's "Lidless Eye": "the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing." Kocher sees Tolkien's source as [[Thomas Aquinas]], "whom it is reasonable to suppose that Tolkien, as a medievalist and a Catholic, knows well".<ref>{{cite book | last = Kocher | first = Paul H. | year = 1972 | title = Master of Middle-earth: The Fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | pages = 76<U+2013>77 | isbn = 0395140978}}</ref> [[Tom Shippey]] makes the same point, but, instead of referring to Aquinas, says Tolkien was very familiar with [[Alfred the Great]]'s Anglo-Saxon translation of [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', known as the ''[[Lays of Boethius]]''. Shippey contends that this Christian view of evil is most clearly stated by Boethius: "evil is nothing." He says Tolkien used the corollary that evil cannot create as the basis of Frodo's remark, "the Shadow ... can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own," and related remarks by [[Treebeard]] and [[Elrond]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Shippey | first = Tom | year = 1983 | title = The Road to Middle-earth | pages = 140<U+2013>141 | isbn = 0-395-33973-1 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | location = Boston}}</ref> He goes on to argue that in ''The Lord of the Rings'' evil does sometimes seem to be an independent force, more than merely the absence of good (though not independent to the point of the [[Manichaeism|Manichaean heresy]]), and suggests that Alfred's additions to his translation of Boethius may have inspired that view.<ref>''Road'', pp. 141<U+2013>145.</ref>

===Publications===
====''Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics''====
As well as his fiction, Tolkien was also a leading author of academic literary criticism. His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo-Saxon epic ''[[Beowulf]]'' by literary critics. The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day. ''Beowulf'' is one of the most significant influences upon Tolkien's later fiction, with major details of both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' being adapted from the poem. The piece reveals many of the aspects of ''Beowulf'' which Tolkien found most inspiring, most prominently the role of monsters in literature, particularly that of the dragon which appears in the final third of the poem:

<blockquote>
As for the poem, one dragon, however hot, does not make a summer, or a host; and a man might well exchange for one good dragon what he would not sell for a wilderness. And dragons, real dragons, essential both to the machinery and the ideas of a poem or tale, are actually rare.<ref>Tolkien, J. R. R. ''Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics'', Oxford, 1963, pp. 10<U+2013>11.</ref>
</blockquote>

====''The Silmarillion''====
Tolkien wrote a brief "Sketch of the Mythology" which included the tales of Beren and L<U+00FA>thien and of T<U+00FA>rin, and that sketch eventually evolved into the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', an epic history that Tolkien started three times but never published. Tolkien desperately hoped to publish it along with ''The Lord of the Rings'', but publishers (both [[Allen & Unwin]] and [[HarperCollins|Collins]]) got cold feet. Moreover, printing costs were very high in [[1950s]] Britain, requiring ''The Lord of the Rings'' to be published in three volumes.<ref>Hammond, Wayne G. ''J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography'', London: January 1993, Saint Paul's Biographies, ISBN 1-873040-11-3, American edition ISBN 0-938768-42-5</ref> The story of this continuous redrafting is told in the posthumous series ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', edited by Tolkien's son, [[Christopher Tolkien]]. From around 1936, Tolkien began to extend this framework to include the tale of ''The Fall of [[N<U+00FA>menor]]'', which was inspired by the legend of [[Atlantis]]. Published in 1977, the final work, entitled ''The Silmarillion'', received the Locus Award for Best Fantasy novel in 1978.<ref name="WWE-1978">{{cite web

====Children's books and other short works====
In addition to his [[mythopoeia|mythopoeic]] compositions, Tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children.<ref>{{cite web|last=Phillip|first=Norman|year=2005|url= http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-mag67.html | title=The Prevalence of Hobbits|work = New York Times|accessdate = 12 March 2006}}</ref> He wrote annual Christmas letters from [[Father Christmas]] for them, building up a series of short stories (later compiled and published as ''[[The Father Christmas Letters]]''). Other stories included ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'' and ''[[Roverandom]]'' (for children), and ''[[Leaf by Niggle]]'' (part of ''[[Tree and Leaf]]''), ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'', ''[[On Fairy-Stories]]'', ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]'' and ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]''. ''Roverandom'' and ''Smith of Wootton Major'', like ''[[The Hobbit]]'', borrowed ideas from his ''legendarium''.

====''The Hobbit''====
Tolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident a book called ''[[The Hobbit]]'', which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm George Allen & Unwin, who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication.<ref name="NYTimes obit"/> However, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel.

====''The Lord of the Rings''====
Even though he felt uninspired, the request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what would become his most famous work: the epic novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (originally published in three volumes 1954<U+2013>1955). Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for ''The Lord of the Rings'', during which time he received the constant support of the [[Inklings]], in particular his closest friend Lewis, the author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''. Both ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' are set against the background of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', but in a time long after it.

Tolkien at first intended ''The Lord of the Rings'' to be a children's tale in the style of ''The Hobbit'', but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing.<ref>{{cite web|author =Times Editorial Staff|date=5 June 1955|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-oxford.html| title=Oxford Calling|work = New York Times|accessdate = 12 March 2006}}</ref> Though a direct sequel to ''The Hobbit'', it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense [[back story]] of [[Beleriand]] that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and other volumes. Tolkien's influence weighs heavily on the [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]] genre that grew up after the success of ''The Lord of the Rings''.

''The Lord of the Rings'' became immensely popular in the 1960s and has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the 20th century, judged by both sales and reader surveys.<ref>{{cite web|author= Seiler, Andy |date= 16 December 2003|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2003-12-12-lotr-main_x.htm| title='Rings' comes full circle|work = [[USA Today]] |accessdate = 12 March 2006}}</ref> In the 2003 "[[Big Read]]" survey conducted by the BBC, ''The Lord of the Rings'' was found to be the "Nation's Best-loved Book".

===Posthumous publications===
[[File:JRRT logo.svg|thumb|125px|Tolkien's [[monogram]], and [[Tolkien Estate]] trademark]]

====''The Silmarillion''====
Tolkien had appointed his son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]] to be his [[literary executor]], and he (with assistance from [[Guy Gavriel Kay]], later a well-known fantasy author in his own right) organized some of his father's unpublished material into a single coherent volume, published as ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' in [[1977 in literature|1977]]<U+2014>his father had previously attempted to get a collection of "Silmarillion" material published in 1937 before writing ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>see ''The History Of Middle-Earth''.</ref>

====''Unfinished Tales'' and ''The History of Middle-earth''====
In [[1980 in literature|1980]] Christopher Tolkien published a collection of more fragmentary material, under the title ''[[Unfinished Tales|Unfinished Tales of N<U+00FA>menor and Middle-earth]]''. In subsequent years ([[1983 in literature|1983]]<U+2013>[[1996 in literature|1996]]) he published a large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''. They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'', the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing ''The Hobbit'' for a third edition, that he would have preferred to completely rewrite the book because of the style of its prose.<ref>{{cite web|last= Martinez |first=Michael|date=27 July 2002|url= http://www.merp.com/essays/MichaelMartinez/michaelmartinezsuite101essay122 |title=Middle-earth Revised, Again |work = Michael Martinez Tolkien Essays |accessdate = 28 April 2009|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080617122627/http://www.merp.com/essays/MichaelMartinez/michaelmartinezsuite101essay122 |archivedate = June 17, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

====''The Children of H<U+00FA>rin''====
More recently, in 2007, the collection was completed with the publication of ''[[The Children of H<U+00FA>rin]]'' by [[HarperCollins]] (in the UK and Canada) and [[Houghton Mifflin]] (in the US). The novel tells the story of [[T<U+00FA>rin Turambar]] and his sister [[Nienor]], children of [[H<U+00FA>rin|H<U+00FA>rin Thalion]]. The material was compiled by Christopher Tolkien from ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', and unpublished manuscripts.

====''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudr<U+00FA>n''====
In February 2009, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' announced that [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] had acquired the American rights to Tolkien's unpublished work ''[[The Legend of Sigurd and Gudr<U+00FA>n]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title=Publishing News Briefs: Week of 2/23.2009 | url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6639000.html | work=Publishers Weekly | date=23 February 2009 | accessdate=12 May 2009}} {{Dead link|date=June 2010| bot=DASHBot}}</ref> The work, which was released worldwide on 5 May 2009 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and HarperCollins, retells the legend of [[Sigurd]] and the fall of the [[Niflungs]] from Germanic mythology. It is a [[narrative poem]] composed in [[alliterative verse]] and is modeled after the [[Old Norse]] poetry of the [[Elder Edda]]. [[Christopher Tolkien]] supplied copious notes and commentary upon his father's work.

According to Christopher Tolkien, it is no longer possible to trace the exact date of the work's composition. On the basis of circumstantial evidence, he suggests that it dates from the 1930s. In his foreword he wrote, "He scarely ever (to my knowledge) referred to them. For my part, I cannot recall any conversation with him on the subject until very near the end of his life, when he spoke of them to me, and tried unsuccessfully to find them."<ref>''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun'', page 5.</ref> In a 1967 letter to [[W. H. Auden]], Tolkien wrote, "Thank you for your wonderful effort in translating and reorganising ''[[V<U+00F6>lusp<U+00E1>|The Song of the Sibyl]]''. In return again I hope to send you, if I can lay my hands on it (I hope it isn't lost), a thing I did many years ago when trying to learn the art of writing alliterative poetry: an attempt to unify the lays about the V<U+00F6>lsungs from the Elder Edda, written in the old eight-line [[fornyr<U+00F0>islag]] stanza."<ref>''Letters'', no. 295.</ref>

====''Mr. Bliss''====
One of Tolkien's least-known short works, published in 1982, it tells the story of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions. The story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932. The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien's sons. Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of ''The Hobbit''. The lavish ink and coloured-pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive. Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style, but then found he didn't have time to do so. The book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of Tolkien's difficult-to-read illustrated manuscript, with a typeset transcription on each facing page.

===Manuscript locations===
The Department of Special Collections and University Archives at [[Marquette University]]'s John P. Raynor, S.J., Library in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], Wisconsin, preserves many of Tolkien's manuscripts;<ref>{{cite web |date=4 March 2003 |url=http://www.marquette.edu/library/collections/archives/tolkien.html |title=J.R.R.

Marquette University has the manuscripts and proofs of ''The Lord of the Rings'', ''The Hobbit'', and other works, including ''Farmer Giles of Ham'', while the Bodleian Library holds the papers containing Tolkien's Silmarillion mythology and his academic work.<ref>{{cite web|author =McDowell, Edwin |date=4 September 1983|url= http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-revisited.html |title=Middle-earth Revisited|work = New York Times|accessdate = 12 March 2006}}</ref>

In 2009, a partial draft of ''[[Language and Human Nature]]'', which Tolkien had begun co-writing with [[C.S. Lewis]] but had never completed, was discovered at the Bodleian Library.<ref>[http://www.txstate.edu/news/news_releases/news_archive/2009/07/CSLewis070809.html Beebe discovers unpublished C.S.

==Languages and philology==
===Linguistic career===
Both Tolkien's academic career and his literary production are inseparable from his love of language and [[philology]]. He specialized in English philology at university and in 1915 graduated with [[Old Norse]] as special subject. He worked for the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] from 1918 and is credited with having worked on a number of words starting with the letter W, including [[walrus]], over which he struggled mightily.<ref>Winchester, Simon (2003). ''The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary.'' Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-860702-4; and Gilliver, Peter, Jeremy Marshall and Edmund Weiner (2006). ''The Ring of Words: Tolkien and the Oxford English Dictionary.'' Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-861069-6.</ref> In 1920, he became Reader in English Language at the [[University of Leeds]], where he claimed credit for raising the number of students of [[linguistics]] from five to twenty. He gave courses in [[Old English]] [[heroic verse]], [[history of English]], various [[Old English]] and [[Middle English]] texts, Old and Middle English philology, introductory [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] philology, [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old Icelandic]], and [[Middle Welsh language|Medieval Welsh]]. When in 1925, aged thirty-three, Tolkien applied for the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon at the Pembroke College, he boasted that his students of Germanic philology in Leeds had even formed a "[[Viking revival|Viking Club]]".<ref>''Letters'', no. 7, to the Electors of the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon, University of Oxford, 27 June 1925.</ref> He also had a certain, if imperfect, knowledge of Finnish.<ref>Grotta, Daniel (2001). ''J.R.R. Tolkien: Architect of Middle Earth''. Philadelphia, Running Press. ISBN 0762409568.</ref>

Privately, Tolkien was attracted to "things of [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] and linguistic significance", and in his 1955 lecture ''[[English and Welsh]]'', which is crucial to his understanding of race and language, he entertained notions of "inherent linguistic predilections", which he termed the "native language" as opposed to the "cradle-tongue" which a person first learns to speak.<ref>''English and Welsh'', O'Donnell Lecture, 1955, cited in Scull, Christina, and Hammond, Wayne G. ''The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide: Reader's Guide'', London, HarperCollins 2006, p. 249.</ref> He considered the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] dialect of [[Middle English]] to be his own "native language", and, as he wrote to [[W. H. Auden]] in 1955, "I am a West-midlander by blood (and took to early west-midland Middle English as a known tongue as soon as I set eyes on it)."<ref>''Letters'', no. 163.</ref>

Tolkien learned [[Latin]], French, and German from his mother, and while at school he learned [[Middle English]], [[Old English]], Finnish, [[Gothic language|Gothic]], Greek, Italian, [[Old Norse]], Spanish, Welsh, and [[Medieval Welsh]]. He was also familiar with Danish, Dutch, [[Lombardic language|Lombardic]], Norwegian, Icelandic, Russian, Swedish, [[Middle Dutch]], [[Middle High German]], [[Middle Low German]], [[Old High German]], [[Proto-Slavic language|Old Slavonic]], and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]],<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Jeffrey | first = Henning | title = On Tolkien: Growing up with language | journal = Model Languages | volume = 1 | issue = 8 | date = January<U+2013>February,  1996 | url = http://www.langmaker.com/ml0108.htm}}</ref> revealing his deep linguistic knowledge, above all of the [[Germanic languages]].

===Language construction===
{{See also|Languages of Middle-earth}}
Parallel to Tolkien's professional work as a philologist, and sometimes overshadowing this work, to the effect that his academic output remained rather thin, was his affection for the construction of [[artificial language]]s. The best developed of these are [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]], the etymological connection between which formed the core of much of Tolkien's ''legendarium''. Language and grammar for Tolkien was a matter of [[aesthetics]] and [[euphony]], and Quenya in particular was designed from "phonaesthetic" considerations; it was intended as an "Elvenlatin", and was phonologically based on Latin, with ingredients from Finnish, Welsh, English, and Greek.<ref name="letter144">''Letters'', no. 144.</ref> A notable addition came in late 1945 with [[Ad<U+00FB>naic]] or [[N<U+00FA>men<U+00F3>rean]], a language of a "faintly [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] flavour", connected with Tolkien's [[Atlantis]] legend, which by ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' ties directly into his ideas about inability of language to be inherited, and via the "[[Second Age]]" and the story of [[E<U+00E4>rendil]] was grounded in the ''legendarium'', thereby providing a link of Tolkien's twentieth-century "real primary world" with the legendary past of his Middle-earth.

Tolkien considered languages inseparable from the mythology associated with them, and he consequently took a dim view of [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary languages]]: in 1930 a congress of Esperantists were told as much by him, in his lecture ''[[A Secret Vice]]'', "Your language construction will breed a mythology", but by 1956 he had concluded that "[[Volap<U+00FC>k]], [[Esperanto]], [[Ido]], [[Novial]], &c, &c, are dead, far deader than ancient unused languages, because their authors never invented any Esperanto legends".<ref name="letter180">''Letters'', no. 180.</ref>

The popularity of Tolkien's books has had a small but lasting effect on the use of language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien's idiosyncratic spellings ''dwarves'' and ''dwarvish'' (alongside ''dwarfs'' and ''dwarfish''), which had been little used since the mid-1800s and earlier. (In fact, according to Tolkien, had the [[Old English]] plural survived, it would have been ''dwerrow''.) He also coined the term ''[[eucatastrophe]]'', though it remains mainly used in connection with his own work.

===Adaptations===
{{Main|Works inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien}}

In a 1951 letter to Milton Waldman, Tolkien wrote about his intentions to create a "body of more or less connected legend", of which "[t]he cycles should be linked to a majestic whole, and yet leave scope for other minds and hands, wielding paint and music and drama".<ref>''Letters'', no. 131.</ref> The hands and minds of many artists have indeed been inspired by Tolkien's legends. Personally known to him were [[Pauline Baynes]] (Tolkien's favourite illustrator of ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' and ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'') and [[Donald Swann]] (who set the music to ''[[The Road Goes Ever On]]''). Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]] created illustrations to ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the early 1970s. She sent them to Tolkien, who was struck by the similarity they bore in style to his own drawings.<ref>{{cite web|author= Thygesen, Peter |year= Autumn, 1999|url= http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3760/is_199910/ai_n8868143| title=Queen Margrethe II: Denmark's monarch for a modern age|work = Scandinavian Review|accessdate = 12 March 2006}}</ref>

However, Tolkien was not fond of all the artistic representation of his works that were produced in his lifetime, and was sometimes harshly disapproving. In 1946, he rejected suggestions for illustrations by Horus Engels for the German edition of ''The Hobbit'' as "too [[The Walt Disney Company|Disnified]] ... Bilbo with a dribbling nose, and Gandalf as a figure of vulgar fun rather than the [[Odin]]ic wanderer that I think of".<ref>''Letters'', no. 107.</ref>

Tolkien was sceptical of the emerging [[Tolkien fandom]] in the United States, and in 1954 he returned proposals for the dust jackets of the American edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'':
{{quote|Thank you for sending me the projected 'blurbs', which I return. The Americans are not as a rule at all amenable to criticism or correction; but I think their effort is so poor that I feel constrained to make some effort to improve it.<ref name="letter144"/>}}

He had dismissed dramatic representations of fantasy in his essay "[[On Fairy-Stories]]", first presented in 1939:
{{quote|In human art Fantasy is a thing best left to words, to true literature. [...] Drama is naturally hostile to Fantasy. Fantasy, even of the simplest kind, hardly ever succeeds in Drama, when that is presented as it should be, visibly and audibly acted.<ref name="On Fairy-Stories">J. R. R. Tolkien, "On Fairy-Stories", in {{ME-ref|T&L}}.</ref>}}

On receiving a [[screenplay]] for a proposed movie adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'' by Morton Grady Zimmerman, Tolkien wrote:
{{quote|I would ask them to make an effort of imagination sufficient to understand the irritation (and on occasion the resentment) of an author, who finds, increasingly as he proceeds, his work treated as it would seem carelessly in general, in places recklessly, and with no evident signs of any appreciation of what it is all about.<ref>''Letters'', no. 207.</ref>}}

Tolkien went on to criticize the script scene by scene ("yet one more scene of screams and rather meaningless slashings"). He was not implacably opposed to the idea of a dramatic adaptation, however, and sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' to [[United Artists]] in 1968. United Artists never made a film, although director [[John Boorman]] was planning a live-action film in the early 1970s. In 1976 the rights were sold to [[Tolkien Enterprises]], a division of the [[Saul Zaentz]] Company, and the [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|first movie adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'']] appeared in 1978, an animated [[rotoscoping]] film directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]] with screenplay by the fantasy writer [[Peter S. Beagle]]. It covered only the first half of the story of ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>{{cite web|author= Canby, Vincent |date= 15 November 1978|url= http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-lordfilm.html| title= Film: 'The Lord of the Rings' From Ralph Bakshi |work = New York Times|accessdate = 12 March 2006}}</ref> In 1977 an [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV production of ''The Hobbit'']] was made by [[Rankin-Bass]], and in 1980 they produced an animated ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'', which covered some of the portions of ''The Lord of the Rings'' that Bakshi was unable to complete.

From 2001 to 2003, [[New Line Cinema]] released [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|''The Lord of the Rings'']] as a trilogy of live-action films that were filmed in New Zealand and directed by [[Peter Jackson]]. The series was successful, performing extremely well commercially and winning numerous [[Academy Awards|Oscars]].

There are currently plans for an upcoming two-film series based on ''[[The Hobbit]]'' (see ''[[The Hobbit (2011 film)]]''). The films are in development for release in December 2011 and December 2012. [[Peter Jackson]] will serve as executive producer and co-writer.

===Memorials===
Posthumously named after Tolkien are the Tolkien Road in [[Eastbourne]], [[East Sussex]], and the [[asteroid]] [[2675 Tolkien]] discovered in 1982. Tolkien Way in [[Stoke-on-Trent]] is named after Tolkien's eldest son, Fr. John Francis Tolkien, who was the priest in charge at the nearby Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of the Angels and St. Peter in Chains.<ref>{{cite web|title=People of Stoke-on-Trent|url= http://www.thepotteries.org/people/tolkien_john.htm |accessdate = 13 March 2005}}</ref> There is also a [[professorship]] in Tolkien's name at Oxford, the J.R.R. Tolkien Professor of English Literature and Language.<ref>[http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/statutes/regulations/185-084.shtml Schedule of Statutory Professorships] in ''Statutes and Regulations'' of the [[University of Oxford]] online at http://ox.ac.uk/statutes (accessed 27 November 2007) {{Dead link|date=June 2010| bot=DASHBot}}</ref>

In the Dutch town of [[Geldrop]], near [[Eindhoven]], the streets of an entire new neighbourhood are named after Tolkien himself ("Laan van Tolkien") and some of the best-known characters from his books. A gaff-topsail [[schooner]] of [[Netherlands]] registry used for passenger cruises on the [[Baltic Sea]] and elsewhere in European waters was named ''[[J.R. Tolkien (schooner)|J.R. Tolkien]]'' in 1998.

In the [[Hall Green]] and [[Moseley]] areas of [[Birmingham]] there are a number of parks and walkways dedicated to J. R. R. Tolkien<U+2014>most notably, the Millstream Way and [[Moseley Bog]]. Collectively the parks are known as the Shire Country Parks. Every year at [[Sarehole Mill]] the Tolkien Weekend is held in memory of the author; the fiftieth anniversary of the release of ''The Lord of the Rings'' was commemorated in 2005.

In the Silicon Valley towns of [[Saratoga, California|Saratoga]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] in California, there are two housing developments with street names drawn from Tolkien's works. At the [[University of California at Davis]] are "Baggins End Innovative Housing", an on-campus commune consisting of 14 polyurethane-insulated fiberglass domes, and an off-campus development known as "Village Homes", a planned community designed to be ecologically sustainable and whose street names are taken from ''The Lord of the Rings''.

===Commemorative plaques===
[[File:Tolkien's Sarehole Mill blue plaque.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sarehole Mill]]'s blue plaque]]
[[File:Tolkien's Plough and Harrow blue plaque.jpg|thumb|right|''The Plough and Harrow'''s blue plaque]]
There are five [[blue plaque]]s that commemorate places associated with Tolkien: one in [[Oxford]], and four in [[Birmingham]]. One of the Birmingham plaques commemorates the inspiration provided by [[Sarehole Mill]], near which he lived between the ages of four and eight, while two others mark childhood homes up to the time he left to attend Oxford University. The third one marks a hotel he stayed at while on leave from World War I. The Oxford plaque commemorates the residence where Tolkien wrote ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and most of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.
