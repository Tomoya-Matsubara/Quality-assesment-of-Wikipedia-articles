'''Bernard Kabanda''' (1959<U+2013>1999) was a [[Ugandan]] guitarist. He had just realised fame in the world music circuit through his appearances at [[WOMAD]] in the USA and the UK in 1999 before he died of AIDS less than two months after his performance at Womad's [[Womad Reading|Reading]] festival, aged only 40.

Before he died, he recorded an album with Womad, called ''Olugendo''. 

He was discovered in the streets of [[Kampala]], Uganda's capital, playing on a guitar he had made himself out of scrap. He was content to play solo, or with simple tin-can percussion as he played in pubs in Kampala, and he did so also in his Womad tour, where he played with Samuel Bakkabulindi, who played make-shift shakers and tin-cans with drum sticks.
