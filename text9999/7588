'''Kim Bendix Petersen''' (born 14 June, 1956 in Copenhagen),<ref name="rhi1">[[G<U+00F6>tz K<U+00FC>hnemund]]: ''A History of Horror''. In: ''[[Rock Hard]]'', no. 282, november 2010, pp. 20-27.</ref> better known by his stage name '''King Diamond''', is a [[Grammy Award]] nominated [[Denmark|Danish]] [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] [[musician]].  As a vocalist, he is known for his extensive vocal range, in particular his usage of [[falsetto]]. He is the lead vocalist for both [[Mercyful Fate]] and the eponymous [[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]].

==Career==
===Early days===
King Diamond's first heavy rock band was called Brainstorm (1974<U+2013>76), with Jeanette Blum (Jean Blue) vocal and bass, Michael Frohn (Mike West) guitar and Jes Jacobsen (Jesse James) drums. King Diamond left Brainstorm and began singing with  local Danish [[hard rock]] band [[Black Rose (band)|Black Rose]]. It was during this time in Black Rose that King Diamond began experimenting with horror themed theatrics as well as shaping a malevolent quasi-Satanic stage persona. In 1980, he left Black Rose and joined the [[punk rock|punk]]-[[heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Brats (band)|Brats]] where he met [[Hank Shermann]]. Soon after, the two of them were asked to help [[Michael Denner]] (also formerly a member of Brats) with his own project Danger Zone. This band included [[Timi Hansen]] and the mentioned musicians would join with King Diamond in 1980 to become [[Mercyful Fate]].

===Mercyful Fate===
{{main|Mercyful Fate}}

Following Mercyful Fate's 1984 release of ''[[Don't Break the Oath]]'' and the subsequent tour (which saw them play in the U.S. for the first time), King Diamond split ways with Mercyful Fate. With him, he took two of his bandmates (Hansen and Denner) to pursue a solo career under his own name.

Mercyful Fate reunited in 1992 (while King Diamond simultaneously continued his solo career) and recorded five more studio albums. In 2000, King decided to put Mercyful Fate on hold and continue on with his solo career. Though Mercyful Fate continues to remain dormant, the band is still under contract with [[Metal Blade Records]]. Also in 1999, King Diamond and Hank Shermann performed the song Mercyful Fate with Metallica live. This performance also has King Diamond without his famous makeup. In recent interviews, King Diamond has stated that Mercyful Fate will record and tour again when the timing is right, saying "It's definitely not finished."<ref name="MF2008">{{cite news | url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=92517 | title=King Diamond: Mercyful Fate, 'Is Definitely Not Finished, at Least in My Book' | publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] | date=March 8, 2008  | first= | last= | accessdate =2008-08-13}}</ref>

===King Diamond===
{{main|King Diamond (band)}}

In 2001, King Diamond worked out a deal with the band [[Usurper (band)|Usurper]] to sing backup vocals on the song "Necronemesis" in exchange for them shifting their recording schedule around to accommodate the recording of ''[[Abigail II: The Revenge]]''. In 2004, King Diamond contributed vocals to "Sweet Dreams", which was the final track on the album of [[Dave Grohl|Dave Grohl's]] heavy metal side project [[Probot]]. In late 2005, King Diamond appeared on the ''[[Roadrunner United]] - The All-Star Sessions'' album, contributing vocals for his song "In the Fire", which featured multiple Roadrunner Records musicians (past and present) working together to create individual songs. King Diamond also guested on the [[Cradle of Filth]] song "Devil Woman" in late 2005.

In April 2006, King reunited with [[Mikkey Dee]] ([[Mot<U+00F6>rhead]] drummer) at a sold-out gig at K<U+00E5>ren in [[Gothenburg, Sweden]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=51287 | title=Mot<U+00F6>rhead's Mikkey Dee Jams with King Diamond in Sweden | publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] | date=April 21, 2006 | first= | last= | accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> In 2001 King referred to Dee as "one of the best drummers of all time and that's something that has bothered us since he left."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=167 | title=Diamonds Are Forever: An Exclusive Interview With King Diamond | publisher=[[KNAC]] | date=December 31, 2001 | first= | last= | accessdate =2007-07-13}}</ref>

King Diamond made an appearance at [[Ozzfest]] on August 9, 2008 at Frisco, TX alongside  [[Metallica]], performing a medley of [[Mercyful Fate]] songs previously released on Metallica's ''[[Garage Inc.]]'' album.

==Stage presence==
On stage, King Diamond uses a microphone handle consisting of a femur bone and a tibia bone in the shape of a cross. King Diamond had previously used a human skull, called Melissa, on stage. In the mid-1980s Melissa was stolen after a performance in the Netherlands.

King Diamond has changed the design of his make-up often over the years. With ''Conspiracy'', he wore a mesh of black and white line war paint, with some red "blood" made to look like a wound coming out of his forehead. With his album ''The Puppet Master'', he used very little white and mainly had black inverted crosses going up and down his face.

==Influences==
King Diamond cites [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]], [[David Byron]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Ronnie James Dio]], [[Ian Gillan]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Robert Plant]] as his primary influences.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.tartareandesire.com/interviews/kingdiamond.html | title=King Diamond Interview | publisher=tartareandesire.com | date= 2005-05 | first= | last= | accessdate =2010-08-29}}</ref>

==Religion==
King Diamond follows<!-- If you change this, add a footnote to prove he doesn't follow that path anymore.--> [[LaVeyan Satanism]], which he does not see as a religion, but a philosophy by which he lived even before reading [[Anton LaVey]]'s ''[[The Satanic Bible]]''.<ref name="rhi1"/> [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]] calls him "one of the only performers of the '80s Satanic Metal who was more than just a [[poseur]] using a devilish image for shock value".<ref name=loc15f>[[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]], Didrik S<U+00F8>derlind: ''[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground]]'', Feral House 1998, pp. 15f.</ref> Diamond has expressed concern that religion has led so many people to kill and destroy each other. He stated that he cannot comprehend why religion has caused so much death and destruction when it is logically impossible to prove the presence or absence of any god. He states that he has reached a point in his life where he has completely given up believing in anything religious.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.heavymetal.dk/interviews_view.php?id=101 | title=King Diamond Interview | publisher=[[heavymetal.dk]] | date= 2006-02-27 | first= | last= | accessdate =2007-07-13}}</ref>

She also helped him make remastered editions of the King Diamond albums ''[[The Spider's Lullabye]]'', ''[[The Graveyard (album)|The Graveyard]]'', ''[[Voodoo (King Diamond album)|Voodoo]]'' and ''[[House of God (album)|House of God]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BLABBERMOUTH.NET/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=111860 | title=King Diamond Is Madly in Love with His 24-Year-Old Wife | publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] | date= 2009-01-04 | first= | last= | accessdate =2009-06-20}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Mercyful Fate has an 11 minute tribute to the band performed by Metallica. It features 5 of their songs. When James Hetfield sings it he does not scream high pitched like King Diamond but in 2008 (and again in 2011, with Hank Shermann, Michael Denner and Timi Hansen<ref name=GWorld>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/metallica-joined-mercyful-fate-anthrax-armored-saint-members-second-30th-anniversary-show |title=Metallica Joined by Mercyful Fate, Anthrax, Armored Saint Members for Second 30th Anniversary Show |publisher=[[Guitar World|GuitarWorld.com]] |date=2011-12-08 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}</ref>)  King Diamond performed Mercyful Fate with Metallica and put the screams in where necessary.

Diamond has been on the covers of many rock and metal magazines and influenced many artists including [[Metallica]]'s [[Lars Ulrich]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metallicaworld.co.uk/Band%20History.htm |title=The History of Metallica |publisher=Metallicaworld.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref> [[Cradle of Filth]],<ref>[http://knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=1868/ Interview with Dani Filth]</ref> [[Cage (band)|Cage]], <ref>[http://www.melodicrock.com/interviews/cage07.html/quote "King Diamond is a big influence because of the music, the story telling and the different voices that are employed."]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref> and [[Andy DiGelsomina]] of the Wagnerian Opera Metal project, Lyraka. <ref>[http://www.louderthanhell.net/bands/united-states/lyraka/interviews/207/aquatic-odyssey /quote "The classic metal operas of King Diamond were a huge influence on my writing."]</ref>
