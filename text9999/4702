"'''Winter'''" is a song by [[rock music|rock]] band [[U2]]. The track was originally planned to be included on the band's 2009 album ''[[No Line on the Horizon]]'', but it was cut at the end of the recording sessions as it did not fit the album's theme. The song does appear on the accompanying film ''[[Linear (film)|Linear]]''. "Winter" was written for the 2009 war film ''[[Brothers (2009 film)|Brothers]]'' at the request of director [[Jim Sheridan]], and it plays over the closing credits. Several different versions of the song have been recorded, including an uptempo rock arrangement on ''Linear'' and a slower acoustic version in ''Brothers''. The song was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]] award.

==Writing and recording==
"Winter" was written for the 2009 war film ''Brothers'' directed by [[Jim Sheridan]].<ref name="Wrap">{{cite web |url=http://www.thewrap.com/ind-column/u2-edges-awards-picture-11990 |title=How U2 Got That Globes Nomination |work=The Wrap |first=Steve |last=Pond |date=2009-12-18 |accessdate=2009-12-19}}</ref> After telling the band about the script for the film, Sheridan asked them if they would write a song for it.<ref name="Wrap" /> Guitarist [[The Edge]] began to compose a piece on piano that the band thought would fit the film. As the recording progressed, it became a "conventional, straightforward arrangement" which The Edge described as "too close to the U2 sound and U2 form".<ref name="Wrap" /> The track did not begin to come together until U2 viewed a rough cut of the film. The Edge noted "it was really at that point that we really got inspired and the song started to come together quite quickly".<ref name="Wrap" /> 

With the help of [[Record producer|producer]] [[Brian Eno]], the band began to work on the song from a different angle, with the result being a more stripped-down version that echoed The Edge's original piano composition. The Edge stated that the piano "seemed to be the key to making the song work... when we went back to that instrument, it seemed to lock in and start to make sense".<ref name="Wrap" /> The original rock arrangement is the one in ''Linear'', while the acoustic version is what appears in ''Brothers''. In addition, an [[electronic music|electronic]] version has also been developed.<ref name="THR" />

Lead singer [[Bono]] wrote the lyrics in one night and they were revised just once after that.<ref name="Wrap" /> [[Tobey Maguire]]'s character Captain Sam Cahill was the inspiration for the lyric, with the band noting that the focus on "intense hidden emotion" and the secrets he held inside "was a jumping off point, thematically."<ref name="Wrap" /> Bono noted that Sheridan wanted a "complex song for a complex character" and so the band wrote two songs: "Winter" and "[[White as Snow (song)|White as Snow]]".<ref name="THR">{{cite web |url=http://riskybusiness.blogs.thr.com/2009/12/bono-u2-golden-globes-jim-sheridan-brothers-pixies-colin-farrell-spike-jonze.html |work=THR |first=Jay A. |last=Fernandez |title=Bono on the Globes, the Pixies, Colin Farrell and Spike Jonze |date=2009-12-15 |accessdate=2009-12-19}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> While "White as Snow" focuses more on the relationship between the Cahill brothers, "Winter" is a "more universal song about the experience of the armed forces in Afghanistan."<ref name="THR" />

U2 wanted to include "Winter" on the album ''No Line on the Horizon'', as well as on ''Brothers'', but this ultimately did not happen; The Edge noted that "though it's a beautiful tune, it doesn't quite fit on our record thematically".<ref name="Wrap" /> The song was cut in the final days of recording.<ref name="guardian">{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/feb/15/u2-no-line-on-the-horizon |title=The Wanderers |work=[[The Guardian]] |first=Sean |last=O'Hagan |date=2009-02-15 |accessdate=2009-12-19 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kjAzS6wq |archivedate=2009-10-23}}</ref> ''Brothers'' was planned to be released before ''No Line on the Horizon'', but the timing made it difficult to complete the song in time, and the band offered Sheridan the use of "White as Snow" instead.<ref name="Wrap" /> The eventual delay in the release of ''Brothers'' gave the band enough time to complete "Winter" and it was used in the film's closing credits.<ref name="Wrap" /><ref>{{cite video |people=[[Jim Sheridan|Sheridan, Jim]] (Director) |title=[[Brothers (2009 film)|Brothers]] |medium=Motion picture |publisher=[[Lions Gate Entertainment]] |date=2009-12-04}}</ref> The band later noted that it was a better selection for the film than "White as Snow".<ref name="Wrap" />

==Composition==
''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' described the rockier ''Linear'' version as being "surrounded by a deceptively simple rhythm track and an evocative string arrangement courtesy of Eno."<ref name="Q">{{cite web |url=http://promo.q4music.com/q4music/u2/inside.shtml |title=U2 Preview New Album to Q |work=Q |accessdate=2008-12-25 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kjBddqWw |archivedate=2009-10-23}}</ref>

==Appearances in other media==
"Winter" appears as the third track in the [[Anton Corbijn]] film ''[[Linear (film)|Linear]]'', based on a story by Corbijn and Bono where a [[Paris]]ian traffic cop travels across France and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to visit his girlfriend in [[Tripoli]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nolineonthehorizon.com/credits.html |title=Linear |publisher=nolineonthehorizon.com |accessdate=2009-03-04}}</ref> During the sequence, the cop, played by [[Sa<U+00EF>d Taghmaoui]], leaves Paris and begins his journey across the French and Spanish countryside. It ends with him pulling off the road for a rest where the next track, "White as Snow", begins.<ref name="Film">{{cite video |people=Corbijn, Anton (Director) |title=Linear |medium=Film |publisher=U2 |location=France |date=2009}}</ref>

==Reception==
"Winter" was nominated for "Best Original Song" at the [[67th Golden Globe Awards]] for its role in ''Brothers''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/nominations/ |title=Nominations and Winners |work=The Hollywood Foreign Press Association |date=2009-12-15 |accessdate=2009-12-19 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5m2lEZqVv |archivedate=2009-12-15}}</ref> In a preview of ''No Line on the Horizon'', ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' called the ''Linear'' version one of the "instantly striking tracks" while describing Bono's "lyric about a soldier in an unspecified war zone" as "fine".<ref name="Q" /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reviewer Brian Hiatt called it a "lovely discarded ballad".<ref name="No Line U2">{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/25585554/inside_u2s_bold_new_horizon |title=Inside U2's Bold New Horizon |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |first=Brian |last=Hiatt |date=2009-01-22 |accessdate=2009-12-19 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kjA3PV0p |archivedate=2009-10-23}}</ref> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' had a negative impression of the ''Brothers'' version, labelling it "a snails-paced somber number with some oh-so-serious, look-at-me flashes of rhythm" while noting that it "could have used some of the gospel atmospheres of the act's 2009 effort ''{{'}}No Line on the Horizon{{'}}''."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/12/leona-lewis-paul-mccartney-and-kate-hudson-the-golden-globes-guide-to-music.html |title=Leona Lewis, Paul McCartney and Kate Hudson: The Golden Globes guide to music |date=2009-12-15 |first=Todd |last=Martens |work=The Los Angeles Times Music Blog |accessdate=2009-12-19}}</ref>
