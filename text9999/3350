'''Tuition fees''' are a means of funding tuition to undergraduate and post graduate certificate students who study at universities in the United Kingdom.  Following the publication of the [[Dearing Report]] into the future funding of higher education on 23 July 1997 then education secretary [[David Blunkett]] announced the introduction of means tested tuition fees to begin in September 1998 with students being required to pay up to <U+00A3>1000 a year for tuition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/3013272.stm |title=BBC Q&A: Student Fees |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-07-09 |accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref><ref name="www.guardian.co.uk/education/2004/jan/27/tuitionfees.students">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2004/jan/27/tuitionfees.students The Guardian - Timeline: Tuition fees]</ref>

Following devolution and the establishment of the [[Scottish government]] tuition fees were abolished in Scotland with the Scottish parliament favouring a system of graduate endowment to pay for tuition.<ref name="www.guardian.co.uk/education/2000/jan/28/tuitionfees.highereducation" />  The endowment system, established as a means to pay for tuition only after graduation was later abolished with any students domiciled and studying in Scotland effectively not having to pay any fees towards their tuition at all as of 1 April 2007.<ref name="www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2008/02/28172530" />  The [[Welsh Assembly]], because of its limited powers in comparison with their Scottish counterparts, remained with the caps imposed on the level of tuition as established by the United Kingdom government. However whereas the United Kingdom government chose to replace means-tested maintenance grants for living expenses whilst at university with a student loan scheme, the Welsh Assembly re-introduced these for Welsh students either studying in Wales or anywhere else in the United Kingdom.<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/546315.stm" /><ref name="www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11515828" />

Developments in the funding of higher education were announced in January 2004 when the United Kingdom government increased the level of tuition fees that universities were allowed to charge, to <U+00A3>3,000 a year.<ref name="www.guardian.co.uk/education/2004/jan/27/tuitionfees.students" />  With a different system in place in Scotland, the changes were applicable to students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.<ref name="www.independent.co.uk/student/student-life/finances/are-topup-fees-good-or-bad-796011.html" />  In 2009, further calls for more funding to be made available to universities<ref name="www.russellgroup.ac.uk/russell-group-latest-news/112-2009/3837-report-on-variable-tuition-fees/" /> resulted in the commissioning of a report from the former chairman of [[BP]] [[John Browne, Baron Browne of Madingley|John Browne]] to look into the future of higher education funding.<ref name="www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=409011&c=2"></ref>  The [[Browne Review]] was published on 12 October 2010 and contained proposals to remove the cap on tuition fees.<ref name="www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/docs/s/10-1208-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report.pdf" />  The resulting debate on the proposals sparked protests from students opposed to any rise in tuition fees.<ref name="www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/nov/10/student-protest-fees-violent">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/nov/10/student-protest-fees-violent The Guardian | Student protests over fees turns violent]</ref>  Despite these protests the government won a vote in the House of Commons which would result in universities eventually being able to charge students up to <U+00A3>9,000 a year for the annual tuition costs of students.<ref name="www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11483638">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11483638 BBC News | Q&A University funding]</ref>

==Introduction of tuition fees==
===The Dearing Report===
In May 1996, Conservative Prime Minister [[John Major]] commissioned an inquiry, led by [[Ronald Dearing, Baron Dearing|Sir Ron Dearing]], into the  funding of British higher education over the next 20 years.<ref name="www.guardian.co.uk/education/2004/jan/27/tuitionfees.students" /><ref group="note">[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/ncihe/ The Dearing Report - Members of the Committee] Members on the Dearing committee were Sir Ron Dearing (Chairman); Ms Judith Evans Departmental Director of Personnel Policy, Sainsbury<U+2019>s; Sir Ron Garrick Managing Director and Chief Executive of Weir Group; Sir Geoffrey Holland Vice-Chancellor of the University of Exeter; Professor Diana Laurillard Pro Vice-Chancellor (Technology Development) of the Open University; Mrs Pamela Morris Headteacher, The Blue School, Wells; Sir Ronald Oxburgh Rector of Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine; Dr David Potter Chairman of Psion plc; Sir George Quigley Chairman of Ulster Bank; Sir William Stubbs Rector of the London Institute; Sir Richard Sykes Chairman and Chief Executive of Glaxo Wellcome plc; Professor David Watson Director of the University of Brighton; Professor Sir David Weatherall Regius Professor of Medicine at the University of Oxford; Professor Adrian Webb Vice-Chancellor of the University of Glamorgan; Mr Simon Wright Academic Affairs Officer, Students Union, the University of Wales College of Cardiff

The inquiry favoured [[means tested]] tuition fees and the continuation of the means tested maintenance grants as well as student loans.  It recommended that graduates made a flat rate contribution of 25 percent of the cost of higher education tuition and that a mechanism for paying for this should be established by 1998-9.<ref name="www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/news/07/0723/dearbrief.shtml" />  Following the publication of the report, the Labour education secretary [[David Blunkett]] announced the introduction of means tested tuition fees to begin in September 1998.  He also announced that the student maintenance grant would be abolished and replaced by student loans.<ref name="www.guardian.co.uk/education/2004/jan/27/tuitionfees.students" /><ref>Fazackerley, A.& Chant, J.[http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/publications/pdfs/PX_More_Fees_Please_WEB.pdf]"More Fees Please - The Future of university fees for undergraduate students page 19</ref><ref>Bolton, J.[http://www.parliament.uk/briefingpapers/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-00916.pdf]"Library of the House of Commons, "Value of Student Maintenance Support" Page 2, section 1.1</ref>

[[File:David Blunkett -8April2010.jpg|thumb|[[David Blunkett]] United Kingdom Secretary of State for Education and Employment 1997-2001 introduced tuition fees of <U+00A3>1000 a year.<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/how_the_education_systems_work/legislation/134626.stm BBC News" />]]

====The Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998====
The teaching and higher education bill was passed into law on 16 July 1998.  In addition to introducing tuition fees it established [[General Teaching Council for England|General Teaching Councils in England]] and Wales, introduced measures to reform the teaching profession and gave a provision for certain young workers to have time off for study.<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/how_the_education_systems_work/legislation/134626.stm BBC News">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/how_the_education_systems_work/legislation/134626.stm BBC News | Teaching and Higher Education Act]</ref>  Prior to the passing of the act the [[House of Lords]] passed three successive amendments to the bill which would have meant that English, Welsh and Northern Irish students studying in Scotland would pay a total of <U+00A3>3,000 for a four year course to bring them in line with Scottish students.<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/how_the_education_systems_work/legislation/134626.stm BBC News" />  The amendments were overturned in the Commons but only after David Blunkett promised an independent review of tuition fees and how they operated in Scotland.<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/how_the_education_systems_work/legislation/134626.stm BBC News" />  The length of a typical honours degree in Scotland was four years compared to three years elsewhere in the United Kingdom.  The difference presented a potential anomoly for when fees were introduced.  It meant that students studying at Scottish universities would be charged an extra year of tuition fees compared with students studying a comparable course elsewhere in the UK. An independant review was led by Sir George Quigley, the Chairman of [[Ulster Bank]], looked into the issue and reported on 29 March 2000.  It recommended that a fees concession should be given to students studying at Scottish universites in the final year of a four year honours degree, if they were domiciled in other parts of the UK.  It also recommended that the cost of meeting this provision should be born by the newly established Scottish Executive.  The recommendations of the report were accepted by the executive at an estimated cost of between <U+00A3>2.5 million and <U+00A3>3.2 million a year.<ref>[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200001/cmselect/cmeduemp/205/20512.htm The Scottish Debate - The Quigley Report]</ref><ref group="note">The Independant review into the funding of tuition fees in Scotland (The Quigley Report) was established as part of the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998 which introduced tuition fees in the UK.  However following the passing of the Scotland Act 1998 devolved parliament was established in Scotland.  The first meeting of the new Scottish executive was held on the 12 May 1999 with responsibility for tuition fees passing from the parliament in Westminster to Scotland.  The Quigley report published on 29 March 2000 meant that it's recommendations were now the responsibility of the Scottish and not the Westminster governments [http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200001/cmselect/cmeduemp/205/20512.htm House of Commons - The Scottish Debate]</ref>

=====Payment arrangements=====
The act introduced a means-tested method of payment for students based on the amount of money their families earned.  Students whose families earned less that <U+00A3>23,000 would be exempt from fees whilst those families earning between <U+00A3>23,000 and <U+00A3>35,000 a year would be charged a percentage of the fees on a sliding scale.  Those families who earned over <U+00A3>35,000 a year would be charged the full fees which amounted to <U+00A3>1,000 a year.<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/specials/the_state_of_education/86754.stm BBC News" />  The maximum fees rose in line with inflation, reaching <U+00A3>1225 in 2007-08.<ref name="Bolton Tuition Fee Statistics" />  Starting with 1999-2000, maintenance grants for living expenses would also be replaced with loans and paid back at a rate of 9 percent of a graduate's income above <U+00A3>10,000.<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/how_the_education_systems_work/legislation/134626.stm BBC News" />  All loans would be government funded and administered by the [[Student Loans Company]], the organisation responsible for administering loans throughout the UK.<ref>[http://www.slc.co.uk/about%20us/index.html The Student Loans Company - About Us]</ref><ref group="note">The Student Loans Company was established in order to administer the 'Student Loans Scheme' introduced as a result of the Education (Student Loans) Act 1990 and the Education (Student Loans) Northern Ireland Order 1990.  It administers tuition fee loans to cover the cost of tuition fees; maintenance loans to cover the cost of living expenses; grants for living costs to cover the cost of living expenses and bursaries and scholarships from universities.  It also administers the repayment of loans through the tax system via a method known as 'Income-contingent repayment (ICR)' meaning that the obligation to repay the loan is dependant on the gross income of the account holder [http://www.slc.co.uk/about%20student%20finance/index.html Student Loans Company - About Student Finance][http://www.slc.co.uk/about%20us/remit/index.html Student Loans Company - Remit]</ref>

====Reaction to the introduction of tuition fees====
The decision signalled the end of the principle of free higher education and was met with concern by some in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].  Former Labour education secretary [[Ted Short]] said that he was ashamed to be a member of the party and [[Ken Livingstone]] accused ministers of "whipping away a ladder of opportunity which they themselves had climbed".<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/specials/the_state_of_education/86754.stm BBC News">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/specials/the_state_of_education/86754.stm BBC News | Student Tuition Fees - costly changes]</ref>  On the other side of the argument top universities in the United Kingdom actually wanted to raise tuition fees further so that they could compete more on the global stage.<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/643991.stm"></ref>  Some universities argued for a 'United States style' system with institutions being able to charge fees at whatever rate the 'market can bear'.  Howard Newby, the President of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals said that the challenge for universities that wanted to introduce higher fees would be how to recycle the income to create bursaries for poorer students.<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/643991.stm">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/643991.stm BBC News | Blunkett feels tuition fees pressure]</ref>  Blunkett said that after the next general election it would be likely that there would be another debate on the issue revisiting the issue of university funding but that whilst he was Secretary of State there would be no top up fees.<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/643991.stm" />  Howard Newby acknowledged that any further changes to the public funding of universities would need to wait "until after the General Election" although he added "Afterwards, the question is how to bring more resources into higher education. Fees have to be part of the equation."<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/643991.stm" />

==Funding of higher education in the devolved parliaments==
===Scottish Parliament===
Following the passing of the [[Scotland Act 1998]], devolved government was established in Scotland with the first meeting of the new [[Scottish Parliament]] taking place on 12 May 1999.<ref>[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-99/or010104.htm#Col7 Scottish Parliament | official report of first meeting]</ref>  The parliament had been given 'primary legislative powers' meaning that over many areas elected representatives were able to pass their own laws.<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/546315.stm">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/546315.stm BBC News | A guide to devolved powers]</ref>  In particular its responsibilities included student fees, school standards and the training and supply of teachers.<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/546315.stm" />

====The Cubie Report====
University funding became an issue following [[Scottish devolution]] when the Labour Party and [[Liberal Democrats]] formed a [[coalition government]].  The Liberal Democrats had made tuition fees a "non-negotiable" element of their election manifesto and therefore a potential stumbling block to forming the coalition.  Labour, the majority party in the coalition had, only one year previously, introduced tuition fees in the United Kingdom of up to <U+00A3>1000 a year and had also abolished maintenance grants.<ref name="www.guardian.co.uk/education/2000/jan/28/tuitionfees.highereducation">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2000/jan/28/tuitionfees.highereducation The Guardian | The Cubie report explained]</ref>  The Cubie committee led by the lawyer Andrew Cubie was formed in July 1999 to look into the funding of higher education in Scotland to try to find a solution to the issue of student financing which threatened to destabilize the coalition.<ref name="www.guardian.co.uk/education/2000/jan/28/tuitionfees.highereducation"/>

=====Recommendations of the Cubie report=====
The Cubie report recommended that tuition fees should be replaced with an endowment scheme with the Scottish Executive paying the fees up front with students only required to pay back <U+00A3>3,000 worth of fees when their earnings reached <U+00A3>25,000.  It also recommended that poorer students would be entitled to a bursary similar to the old maintenance grant.<ref name="www.guardian.co.uk/education/2000/jan/28/tuitionfees.highereducation"/>  The estimated cost to the Scottish government of the recommendations were set at <U+00A3>71 million.  In the end the government announced that students would only pay back <U+00A3>2,000 of their fees but starting when their earnings reached <U+00A3>10,000 a significant drop on the recommended <U+00A3>25,000.<ref name="www.guardian.co.uk/education/2000/jan/28/tuitionfees.highereducation"/>  With such changes, the Scottish executive estimated that the scheme would cost <U+00A3>50 million.<ref name="www.guardian.co.uk/education/2000/jan/28/tuitionfees.highereducation"/>
[[Image:Scotparialmentinside.jpg|left|thumbnail|250px|The Debating chamber of the Scottish Parliament. In Scotland students currently do not pay tuition fees.<ref name="www.guardian.co.uk/education/2000/jan/28/tuitionfees.highereducation"/>]]

=====Response to the Cubie report=====
Speaking following the publication of the report the Liberal Democrats deputy first minister [[Jim Wallace]] said "we welcome the fact that Cubie recommends the abolition of tuition fees. This remains the party's policy... Andrew Cubie and his team have done a thorough job over the last six months. As he himself says, the extent of the need for change would not have been identified if the committee had not been established."  The [[Scottish National Party|Scottish National Party's]] (SNP) [[John Swinney]] described the report as a "humiliation" for Labour saying that it left their policy on student financing in "tartan tatters".  The Conservatives [[Brian Monteith]] was sceptical of the report saying "the Cubie Committee says it is abolishing tuition fees but they will be replaced with a graduate tax that recovers exactly the same amount that would have been paid in fees."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/573853.stm BBC Scotland | Reaction to Cubie report]</ref>  The findings of the report were considered by a joint ministerial working group established by Scottish First Minister [[Donald Dewar]].<ref name="text of tuition fees agreement" />  The abolition of tuition fees would commence in August 2000 with the endowment scheme taking their place the following year.  Scottish students studying elsewhere in the United Kingdom would still be required to pay fees but Scottish students choosing to study in Scotland would not.  English, Welsh and Northern Irish students studying in Scotland would be liable to pay tuition fees but would not be required to pay the graduate endowment.  Students from outside the United Kingdom but from within the [[European Union]] would not be required to pay tuition fees if studying in Scotland but would be required to pay the graduate endowment upon graduation.<ref name="text of tuition fees agreement">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/618698.stm BBC News | Full text of tuition fees agreement]</ref>  In order to qualify as a 'Scottish student' and be exempted from paying tuition fees, the student must have lived in Scotland for at least three years prior to the first day of the first academic year of the course.  Students would also be exempt if they were classed as 'ordinarily resident' in the country on the first day of their course. This meant that those students who had moved to Scotland for a reason other than study would be also be exempt.<ref name="Herriott Watt endowment" />

====The graduate endowment and its abolition====
The 'Education (Graduate Endowment and Student Support) (Scotland) Act 2001' established the criteria by which the graduate endowment would be paid.<ref name="graduate endowments">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6747811.stm BBC News | Q&A Graduate endowments]</ref>  Scottish domiciled or European Union students from outside the United Kingdom <ref name="Herriott Watt endowment" /><ref group="note">[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/research/pdf_res_papers/rp00-18.pdf - "The Scottish Parliament information centre", "The Education (Graduate Endowment and Student Support) (Scotland) Bill", "research paper 00-18", "page 2"] The GE will be paid by those who have undertaken a full-time first degree course
at an institution funded by the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council or the
Scottish Further Education Funding Council. This is in recognition of the fact that
many students study for their first degree at a further education college.
Regulations to be made under the Bill will establish further criteria for eligibility:
Liable individuals will be:
- Scottish-domiciled or EU students.
- Students whose full-time degree study exceeds a specified minimum period.
- Those who have satisfied the criteria for being awarded a degree <U+2013> i.e. to
prevent students from not graduating when they complete their course.""page 2"</ref> who had undertaken a first full-time degree course on or after 1 August 2001 were eligible to pay the endowment.<ref name="page 2-3">"The Scottish Parliament information centre"[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/research/pdf_res_papers/rp00-18.pdf]"The Education (Graduate Endowment and Student Support) (Scotland) Bill", "research paper 00-18""page 2-3"</ref>  On completion of their degree, students would pay a fixed amount initially set by the Scottish government at <U+00A3>2000 and later rising to <U+00A3>2289 for students commencing their studies during the academic year of 2006-07.<ref name="graduate endowments" />  The amount would become payable after the student successfully completed their degree and could be paid either by taking out a student loan, paying a lump sum or by a combination of both.<ref name="Herriott Watt endowment">[http://www.hw.ac.uk/recruitment/financing/endowment.htm Herriott Watt University | Graduate endowment - Your questions answered]</ref>  The first students began paying back the endowment on 1 April 2005.<ref name="graduate endowments" />

Not all students had to pay.  Those taking qualifications below degree level were exempt as were mature students over the age of 25, lone parents in receipt of a 'lone parent grant' and those in receipt of 'Disabled Student Allowance'.  Students who dropped out of university would also not have to pay as they would be allowed 'one false start'.<ref name="page 2-3" />  Certain courses, such as teacher training courses, were also exempt from the endowment.<ref name="page 2-3" />

In the summer of 2007, the Scottish government proposed the 'Graduate Endowment Abolition (Scotland) Bill' that would scrap the graduate endowment altogether.  It meant that no future students would pay the endowment and that would also apply to graduates who graduated on or after 1 April 2007.<ref>Bolton, Paul. "Tuition Fee Statistics" [http://www.parliament.uk/briefingpapers/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-00917.pdf], ''Library of the House of Commons'', November 23, 2010, page 3, section 1.4</ref>  On 28 February 2008 the bill was approved in a move which restored free higher education in Scotland.  The Scottish education secretary [[Fiona Hyslop]] speaking at the time said "We believe access to education should be based on ability to learn, not ability to pay. Today's removal of the graduate endowment fee is great news for current and future students and last year's graduates, helping to significantly reduce their debt burden."<ref name="www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2008/02/28172530">[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2008/02/28172530 Scottish Government | Graduate endowment scrapped]</ref>  Labours education spokesperson [[Rhona Brankin]] however said that it's abolition would not tackle student poverty.   Voting against the measure she said that ministers had "failed miserably" to produce evidence that scrapping the endowment would increase the numbers of people going to university.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7268101.stm BBC News | MSP's vote to scrap endowment fee]</ref>

===Welsh Assembly===
[[Image:Debating Chamber.jpg|right|thumbnail|250px|The Debating chamber of the [[Welsh Assembly]].  The assembly has the power to vary some laws as set down by the United Kingdom parliament.<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/546315.stm" />]]
Following devolution, the [[Welsh Assembly]] was given what were known as 'Secondary legislative powers' which meant that unlike their Scottish counterparts, they were only able to vary some laws set by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in London.  The assembly could vary specified devolved issues including setting and monitoring school standards, the content of the national curriculum and the training and supply of teachers.<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/546315.stm" />  The cap on the amount of tuition fees that Welsh universities could charge rose to <U+00A3>3000 in the academic year of 2007-08 bringing Wales in line with England and Northern Ireland although the Welsh Assembly up until 2010-11 gave all Welsh students studying in Wales a grant of <U+00A3>1890 towards their fees.<ref name="www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11515828">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11515828 BBC News | Tuition fees across the UK - Wales]</ref><ref name="Guide to Fees"></ref>

====Maintenance grants in Wales====
Maintenance grants, initially up to <U+00A3>1,500 were re-introduced by the Welsh Assembly in 2002 in a move that was, at the time, seen to put pressure on the United Kingdom government who still favoured the use of student loans.<ref name="grants return"></ref>  The Welsh education secretary, Labour's [[Jane Davidson]], said that <U+00A3>41 million had been ring-fenced for less well off families meaning that up to 250,000 Welsh students would be eligible for a means-tested grant of up to <U+00A3>1,500.<ref name="grants return"></ref>  Welsh students studying outside of Wales would also still be eligible for the grants if studying within the United Kingdom.<ref name="grants return"></ref>  Students from the rest of the United Kingdom or the European Union however would not be eligible for assistance from the Welsh Assembly if studying in Wales.<ref name="Guide to Fees">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2005/aug/04/highereducation.politics The Guardian | All Change - Guide to Fees]</ref>  At the time the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] president Owain James welcomed the move saying "this is a great victory for Welsh students.... Maintenance grants are crucial to keep students in education."<ref name="grants return"></ref>  Speaking about the re-introduction of maintenance grants, the Conservatives education spokesperson Jonathon Morgan said that Labour had performed a U-turn and said that the party should apologise for introducing tuition fees in the first place.<ref name="grants return">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/1815597.stm BBC News | Grants return sets Wales apart]</ref>

On 22 January 2003 the new Labour education secretary [[Charles Clarke]] published a white paper with proposals allowing universities to set their own tuition fees up to a cap of <U+00A3>3000 a year.<ref name="www.guardian.co.uk/education/2004/jan/27/tuitionfees.students" />  The proposal was controversial as during the election campaign for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 General Election]] their manifesto stated that Labour "will not introduce top-up fees and has legislated against them."<ref name="www.guardian.co.uk/education/2004/jan/27/tuitionfees.students" />  The white paper stated that the fees would only be repaid once the graduate earned over <U+00A3>15,000 a year.<ref name="www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8057871/Grants-loans-and-tuition-fees-a-timeline-of-how-university-funding-has-evolved.html">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8057871/Grants-loans-and-tuition-fees-a-timeline-of-how-university-funding-has-evolved.html The Telegraph | Grants, loans and tuition fees: a timeline of how university funding has evolved]</ref>  The likelihood of a backbench rebellion from Labour MPs forced Clarke to introduce a number of concessions to the rebels in order to avoid a Commons defeat in a vote held on 27 January 2004.  Amendments to the bill included an increase in the amount poorer students could claim in a maintenance grant, a promise to review the <U+00A3>3,000 cap after three years and the promise to write off all student debt after 25 years.<ref name="www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8057871/Grants-loans-and-tuition-fees-a-timeline-of-how-university-funding-has-evolved.html" /><ref group="note">[http://www.thinkmoney.com/debt/debt-help-debt-advice/student-debt-guide-0-3324.htm Think Money - Student Debt Guide - Is there a `cut-off point` for Student Loan repayments?]"Your Student Loan will eventually be written off if you never earn enough to make payments, or if you haven`t repaid the full amount within a certain period.  For loans issued before September 2006, any remaining debt will be written off when you reach 65, while loans issued after September 2006 will be written off 25 years after the first April of your graduation."</ref>  Eventually the vote was passed with Labour winning by 316 votes to 311 with 71 Labour MPs voting against and 19 Labour MPs abstaining.  The result provided relief for [[Tony Blair]] in what had been seen as his biggest test yet as Prime Minister.  Education Secretary Clarke said "had we lost it, it would have been a blow to our authority but as it is we have the ability to take the legislation forward."<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3434329.stm">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3434329.stm BBC News | Blair wins key top up fees vote]</ref>  The Conservatives shadow education and health secretary [[Tim Yeo]] said the result was an "utter humiliation" for ministers and said that the vote had only been won because of the votes of Scottish MPs who had voted to impose fees on English students which would not apply north of the border.<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3434329.stm" />  The Liberal Democrat leader [[Charles Kennedy]] said that "nobody has emerged from this shabby compromise with any credit."  He added "it took a dodgy deal between the prime minister, the chancellor and backbenchers to get this Bill through."<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3434329.stm" />  The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) however said before the vote that the plans were "essential" for the revitalization of British universities.<ref name="www.guardian.co.uk/education/2004/jan/27/tuitionfees.students" />  University vice-chancellors meanwhile had previously warned the government that universities were facing a shortfall in funding.  In their submission to the governments [[Spending Review|2004 comprehensive spending review]], the lobby group 'Universities UK' requested a further <U+00A3>8.79 billion,<ref>Universities UK [http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/Publications/Documents/SR2004.pdf]"Achieving our Vision - 2004 spending review submission for England and Northern Ireland" page 20 section 1.5</ref> a figure it was feared would grow should legislation to increase tuition fees fail.<ref name="THE University shortfall <U+00A3>10bn">{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=181694&sectioncode=26 |title=Price of failure more than <U+00A3>10bn, v-cs warn |publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=2003-12-05 |accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref>  Such was the level of underfunding, vice chancellors argued, and assuming that all universities would charge the full <U+00A3>3,000 a year, the measures would only "ameliorate, not solve, the funding crisis" recouping only <U+00A3>1.4 billion extra revenue a year.<ref name="THE University shortfall <U+00A3>10bn" />  Michael Driscoll, chair of the Coalition of Modern Universities, said "Universities face a financial black hole, but the real black hole is in teaching. We do not have enough money to pay our staff."<ref name="THE University shortfall <U+00A3>10bn" />

===Scottish MP vote controversy===
The vote on 27 January 2004 caused controversy as because of the close nature of the result, the votes of MPs with constituencies in Scotland proved crucial in terms of getting it through.  With university funding devolved in Scotland, the result of any increase in tuition fees would not affect students who chose to live and study in Scotland.<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3432767.stm" />  [[Peter Duncan (Scottish politician)|Peter Duncan]], the Conservatives only Scottish MP, had abstained from the vote saying "This is a dark day for British democracy, and the actions of Scottish MPs are reprehensible.... The constitutionally cavalier actions of Scottish MPs undermine the devolution settlement and play into the hands of the separatists on both sides of the border.... Those Scottish MPs who walked through the lobbies today should hang their heads in shame."<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3432767.stm">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3432767.stm BBC News | Scottish MPs attacked over fees vote]</ref>  Shadow Eduction Secretary [[Tim Yeo]] said in a point of order "It is completely wrong that a bill which imposes higher charges on students attending the English universities should only be carried by this house using the votes of Scottish MPs when the students attending universities in the constituencies of those Scottish MPs do not have to pay those higher charges."<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3432767.stm" />  In all 46 Scottish Labour MPs voted with the government with the 5 SNP and 10 Liberal Democrat MPs representing constituencies in Scotland voting against.  Labour's [[Frank Doran (UK politician)|Frank Doran]], a Scottish MP who voted with the government said "my fundamental objections were about the variable fees and the effect on Scottish universities, but I think the effect of the variable fees has been mitigated in a huge way by the various concessions the government has made."<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3432767.stm" />

===Higher Education Act 2004===
{{Main|Higher Education Act 2004|Office for Fair Access}}
[[Image:Anti top up fees poster.jpg|right|thumb|A poster advertising an anti-fees demonstration in January 2004]]
On 1 July 2004 legislation to enable the introduction of variable tuition fees was given [[royal assent]] and became the Higher Education Act 2004.  Under the Act, universities in England could begin to charge variable fees of up to <U+00A3>3000 a year for students enrolling on courses as from the academic year of 2006-07 or later.  This was also introduced in Northern Ireland in 2006-07 and introduced in Wales in 2007-08.  In 2009-10 the cap rose to <U+00A3>3225 a year to take account of inflation.<ref name="tuition fee stats"></ref>  Students from the European Union (EU) would be eligible for the same level of tuition fees as students from within the United Kingdom.  Students from outside the EU would have to pay the fees set by the individual university.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2005/aug/04/highereducation.politics The Guardian | All change]</ref><ref group="note">[http://www.ukcisa.org.uk/student/fees_student_support.php UK Council for International Student affairs] International students can be charged fees from <U+00A3>4000 to <U+00A3>18,000 a year depending on the university.  All publicly funded educational institutions have two rates that they charge students, a lower 'home' rate and a higher 'overseas' rate.  International students from outside the UK or the European Union will pay the 'overseas' rate unless they meet certain other criteria which would enable them to become a 'home' fee payer[http://www.ukcisa.org.uk/student/info_sheets/tuition_fees_ewni.php UK Council for International Students Affairs - Advice for International Students]</ref>

To cover the cost of the fees UK and EU students could take out a [[Student loans in the United Kingdom|tuition fee loan]] meaning that there wold be no requirement to pay fees upfront.<ref name="tuition fee stats">Bolton, Paul. "Tuition Fee Statistics" [http://www.parliament.uk/briefingpapers/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-00917.pdf], ''Library of the House of Commons'', November 23, 2010, page 2, section 1.2</ref>  The loan, which would not depend on household income, would be paid directly to the university or college from the student loans company.<ref>[http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/UniversityAndHigherEducation/StudentFinance/Gettingstarted/DG_171573 DirectGov | How much will university or college cost?]</ref> 

The act also established the Office for Fair Access (OFFA) in an effort to ensure that the 'introduction of higher tuition fees in 2007-08 did not deter people from entering higher education for financial reasons'.  It also would ensure that 'universities and colleges were explicitly committed to increasing participation in higher education among under-represented groups'.<ref>[http://www.offa.org.uk/about/background/ Office for Fair Access | Background]</ref>  The fees also became known as 'top up fees' as prior to September 2006 the amount paid for tuition would be a flat rate whereas from September 2006 the fees became variable and would help universities to 'top up' the shortfall in funding to cover the cost of certain degrees.<ref name="www.independent.co.uk/student/student-life/finances/are-topup-fees-good-or-bad-796011.html">[http://www.independent.co.uk/student/student-life/finances/are-topup-fees-good-or-bad-796011.html The Independant | Are top up fees good or bad?]</ref>  Speaking about the introduction of variable tuition fees in 2005, Higher Education Minister [[Bill Rammell]], claimed that the changes were necessary saying "I think we have to get real. In an ideal world you wouldn't bring in these changes, but we don't live in an ideal world. To maintain and develop a world class system of higher education would cost the equivalent of 3p or 4p on the standard rate of tax".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4304774.stm BBC News | Rammells mission to explain fees]</ref>

====Calls for review in university funding====
In their 'changing landscapes' report published in 2009, Universities UK said that 'in practice, although institutions theoretically had the choice whether to charge the full tuition fee, almost all chose to set the fee at the <U+00A3>3,000 cap.<ref name="www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/Publications/Documents/changing_landscapes.pdf">[http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/Publications/Documents/changing_landscapes.pdf Universities UK | changing landscapes report] Page 7</ref>  It also said that the "current fee arrangements" had not "created an economic market in which the price of an institution is a significant factor in how potential students choose the institution they want to go to and in which institutions compete on price to attract students."  In their 'conclusions on the changing market' they said that raising tuition fees to "<U+00A3>5,000 a year" would be just the "maintenance of the status quo" and claimed that "students are insensitive to tuition fees below this level."  The report suggested that "increasing fees above <U+00A3>5,000 would lead more and more institutions to review their practice of setting fees below the cap".<ref>[http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/Publications/Documents/changing_landscapes.pdf Universities UK | changing landscapes report] page 18, section 2.4</ref>  Responding to the report [[Wendy Piatt]], Director General of the [[Russell Group]] who represent 20 of the UK's leading universities, said "There is a growing consensus that without increased investment, there is a real danger that the success of our world-leading universities will not be sustained.  In a difficult economic climate there is even greater urgency to find additional funding".<ref name="www.russellgroup.ac.uk/russell-group-latest-news/112-2009/3837-report-on-variable-tuition-fees/">[http://www.russellgroup.ac.uk/russell-group-latest-news/112-2009/3837-report-on-variable-tuition-fees/ Russell Group | Russell Group response to new Universities UK report on variable tuition fees]</ref>  She quoted research from the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] (HEFCE) which said that universities needed an additional 15-20 percent worth of funding for current teaching levels to be sustained and suggested that an increase in tuition fees should be something that should be an option as the increase in 2006 had no adverse impact on recruitment.<ref name="www.russellgroup.ac.uk/russell-group-latest-news/112-2009/3837-report-on-variable-tuition-fees/" />

==The Browne Review==
{{Main|Browne Review}}
[[Image:Peter Mandelson.jpg|right|thumbnail|250px|[[Peter Mandelson]] UK Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills 2009-2010 commissioned a review into fees and university funding to be published after the 2010 General Election<ref name="www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=409011&c=2"></ref>]]
On 9 November 2009 Business Secretary [[Peter Mandelson]] announced a further review into fees and university funding in England, led by [[John Browne, Baron Browne of Madingley|John Browne]], former chief executive of [[BP]].  Browne, a cross-bencher in the [[House of Lords]] and also known as [[Lord Browne of Madingley]], was joined on his panel by [[David Eastwood]], vice-chancellor of the [[University of Birmingham]] and [[Julia King]], vice-chancellor of [[Aston University]] as well as a number of other professionals.<ref name="www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=409011&c=2">[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=409011&c=2 Times Education Supplement | Browne to lead fees review]</ref><ref group="note">[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article6909645.ece The Times - Lord Browne of Madingley heads team to look at raising tuition fees] Members on the Browne inquiry were Lord Browne of Madingley former chairman of BP; Sir Michael Barber former chief advisor to David Blunkett; Diane Coyle former jounalist and Treasury economist; Professor David Eastwood vice chancellor of Birmingham university; Julia King vice chancellor of Aston university, Peter Sands chief executive of Standard Chartered Bank, Rajay Naik UK board member of the Big Lottery Fund</ref> Speaking at the launch, Mandelson said that the review would take into account the goal of widening participation in higher education, the need for affordability and the desire to simplify the student-support system.<ref name="www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=409011&c=2"></ref>  He said that variable tuition fees currently provided universities with a secure income of <U+00A3>1.3 billion a year and "since they were introduced, student numbers have continued to rise, along with the numbers coming from lower-income backgrounds."<ref name="www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=409011&c=2"></ref>  The review would look at funding for both full time and part time students, considering tuition fees and alternatives to them, such as a graduate tax.  It would not be published until after the 2010 General Election.  

Speaking on the launch of the review, [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] President Wes Streeting said "there is a real danger that this review will pave the way for higher fees and a market in prices that would see poorer students priced out of more prestigious universities and other students and universities consigned to the 'bargain basement'".  However, the Russell Group's [[Wendy Piatt]] argued that the current level of funding was inadequate, saying "as universities are facing severe economic conditions and ferocious global competition it is clear that the status quo is not viable".<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/8350051.stm BBC News">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/8350051.stm BBC News | Review of student fees launched]</ref>

===Political background prior to review publication===
Following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]] on 6 May 2010 no one party commanded a majority in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and so following negotiations the Conservative and Liberal Democratic parties formed a [[United Kingdom coalition government (2010<U+2013>present)|coalition government]].<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7119226.ece#cid=OTC-RSS&attr=797084 The Times | Britain wakes up to a hung parliament]</ref>  With [[David Cameron]] installed as Prime Minister and [[Nick Clegg]] as Deputy Prime Minister the two men produced a coalition agreement setting out how the two parties would work together.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8693535.stm BBC News | Cameron and Clegg set out radical policy program]</ref> In response to the issue of university funding and higher education, the agreement said that higher education policy would have to await the outcome of the Browne report which had not yet been published.  The agreement also made mention of the desire to increase the number of university places available.<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8693832.stm">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8693832.stm BBC news | policy to policy: the governments plans]</ref>  For the Liberal Democrats the findings of the review were a big unknown and potentially problematic for the party as they had made the abolition of student tuition fees within a period of six years one of their manifesto commitments and many of the parties MP's had signed a [[Vote for Students pledge|National Union of Students pledge]]<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8693832.stm" /><ref>[http://www.nus.org.uk/Campaigns/Funding-Our-Future/Lib-Dem-MPs-sign-the-pledge/ National Union of Students | Lib Dems MPs signe the pledge]</ref> stating that they would not vote for any increase in tuition fees.  As a result of this potential conflict, the agreement stipulated that the Liberal Democrats could abstain on any vote which may require fees to be increased.<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8693832.stm" />

===Findings and recommendations of the review===
The [[Browne Review]] into the future of Higher Education Funding published its report on 12 October 2010 in a document entitled 'Securing a Sustainable Future for Higher Education'.<ref name="www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/docs/s/10-1208-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report.pdf">[http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/docs/s/10-1208-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report.pdf Securing a Sustainable Future for Higher Education]</ref>  The report based its recommendations on six principles which were:

*More investment should be available for Higher Education<ref name="www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/docs/s/10-1208es-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report-summary.pdf" />
*Student choice should be increased<ref name="www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/docs/s/10-1208es-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report-summary.pdf" />
*Everyone who has the potential should be able to benefit from Higher Education<ref name="www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/docs/s/10-1208es-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report-summary.pdf" />
*No-one should have to pay until they start work<ref name="www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/docs/s/10-1208es-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report-summary.pdf" />
*When payments are made they should be affordable<ref name="www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/docs/s/10-1208es-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report-summary.pdf" />
*Part-time students should be treated the same as full-time students for the costs of learning<ref name="www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/docs/s/10-1208es-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report-summary.pdf" />

The main recommendations of the report were:

*Removing the cap of <U+00A3>3290 a year that universities could charge for tuition<ref name="www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/docs/s/10-1208es-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report-summary.pdf">[http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/docs/s/10-1208es-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report-summary.pdf Browne report executive summary]</ref>
*Raising the point at which tuition fees loans are paid back from <U+00A3>15,000 to <U+00A3>21,000 a year<ref name="www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/docs/s/10-1208es-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report-summary.pdf" />
*Loans to only be paid back at 9% of any income earned over <U+00A3>21,000<ref name="www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/docs/s/10-1208es-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report-summary.pdf" />
*Part-time students would have equal entitlement to tuition under the 'Student Finance Plan'<ref name="www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/docs/s/10-1208es-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report-summary.pdf" />

===Reaction to the Browne Report===
The recommendations contained within the report issued by the Browne commission contained one particularly controversial area in the removal of the cap on tuition fees.  [[John Browne, Baron Browne of Madingley|Lord Browne]] however in an interview with [[BBC Breakfast]] predicted that few institutions would put fees up very high.<ref name="www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11519642">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11519642 BBC News | Student tuition fees - Browne urges no limits]</ref>  For the Liberal Democrats in particular it was predicted that the review would cause deep political divisions both within their own party and within the coalition government as many had signed a pledge promising not to vote for any increase in tuition fees prior to the election.<ref name="www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11519642" />  [[Vince Cable]], the Liberal Democrat [[Business Secretary]], said the proposals were "probably on the right lines" whilst the [[Liberal Youth]] section of the party described the fee rise as a "disaster".  Backbench Liberal Democrat MP [[Greg Mulholland]] immediately said he would vote against the plan.<ref name="www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11519642" />  Within the media the ''[[Financial Times]]'' called the report by Lord Browne a "genuinely radical document that would, if implemented, lead to a free-market revolution in higher education provision".<ref name="www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8058885/Lord-Browne-review-round-up-of-reaction.html">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8058885/Lord-Browne-review-round-up-of-reaction.html The Daily telegraph | round up of reaction to the Browne report]</ref>  David Blackburn of the [[The Spectator|Spectator]] called the proposals a "sustainable and permanent solution" and described the plan as "progressive".<ref name="www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8058885/Lord-Browne-review-round-up-of-reaction.html" />  [[The Guardian|The Guardian's]] Martin Hall however said that there would be a "social cost of variable tuition fees" and said that institutions rated highest in the league tables would be able to charge more and so force out poorer students.<ref name="www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8058885/Lord-Browne-review-round-up-of-reaction.html" /> Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, also defended the report saying "Everybody wants the same thing, not only sustainable funding for universities, but also a system where the teaching you receive at university, the upfront costs of it are free at the point of use, that we encourage more students from poor backgrounds into university than is presently the case and, crucially, that when people pay back for their university tuition, they only do it when they can afford to do it and that people who earn more pay a bit more back than others. I think that is a fair and sustainable approach and that is what we are looking for in the Browne report today."<ref name="www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8058885/Lord-Browne-review-round-up-of-reaction.html" />  For Labour, the shadow Business Secretary [[John Denham (politician)|John Denham]] said that the report deserved "careful study" and said that it was "right that some students make some contribution towards their education".  However he added 
"We are concerned that many graduates will be shackled by debt for the majority of their working lives; that those on middle incomes in typical graduate jobs may pay more than their fair share and the highest earners will pay less and be free of debt much earlier."<ref>[http://www2.labour.org.uk/browne-review-response---denham,2010-10-12 The Labour party | Browne review response]</ref>

====Government response====
On 3 November 2010 the government responded to the review by making a number of adjustments to the recommendations, the main one being the rejection of Browne's recommendation that the cap to Universities be completely lifted, instead agreeing a <U+00A3>9,000 per year cap.<ref name="BBC Q&A university funding">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11483638 BBC News | Q&A University Funding]</ref>    In terms of paying back the loan, Browne had suggested a flat rate of interest should be charged at 2.2% plus inflation.  On this the government opted for a tapered rate which would rise to 3% depending on earnings in an effort to make the system more progressive.<ref name="Universities UK government response to Browne"></ref>  The earnings limit at which loans would begin to be paid back would rise in line with the Browne recommendations from <U+00A3>15,000 to <U+00A3>21,000.<ref name="BBC Q&A university funding" /><ref name="Universities UK government response to Browne">[http://www.universitiesglobalpartnershipnetwork.net/surreynet/departments/communications/policy/Government%20response%20to%20Browne%20UUK.pdf Universities UK | Government response to the Browne report]</ref>  Business Secretary [[Vince Cable]] said that access to higher education would be on the basis of ability and not the ability to pay.  He said "no-one will have to pay up-front tuition fees. We are extending loans for the cost of tuition to the majority of part-time students. No one will contribute until they can afford to do so <U+2013> when they are in well paid jobs...The graduate contribution system that we have designed will protect the lowest earning graduates and ensure that their contributions are linked to their ability to pay; indeed, under our new more progressive repayment system, 25%, maybe as many as 30% according to the IFS, of graduates with the lowest lifetime earnings will pay back less than they do now."<ref name="BIS press release">[http://nds.coi.gov.uk/content/detail.aspx?NewsAreaId=2&ReleaseID=416343&SubjectId=2 BIS Press Office | Browne report]</ref> [[David Willetts]], the Universities Minister claimed that the "progressive package" would put universities on a sustainable footing with extra freedoms and less bureaucracy.  However in return for that he stated that there would be "greater choice for students with a stronger focus on high quality teaching."<ref name="BIS press release" />

====Protests against the proposals====
{{Main|2010 UK student protests}}
[[Image:Student protest march past Houses of Parliament.jpg|right|thumbnail|250px|Students staged a number of demonstrations leading up to the Commons vote on 9 December 2010<ref name="Protests on day of commons vote" />]]
On 10 November 2010 students staged the first in a series of marches to demonstrate against the proposed increase in the rise in tuition fees.  The demonstrations in London received negative publicity after a group of protesters attacked the Conservative party headquarters.  The [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]], who had staged the protests, condemned the violence as "despicable" with union president Aaron Porter saying "this was not part of our plan".<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11726822 BBC News | Violence at Tory HQ overshadows student fees protest]</ref>  Protests continued on 24 November 2010 with the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts (NCAFC) organising a mass national walk out of education and protest.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/nov/24/student-school-pupils-protests-walkout|title= Second day of student protests - how the demonstrations happened |publisher=''The Guardian'' Online |date=25 November 2010 | accessdate=November 25, 2010}}</ref>  Faced once again with protesters on the streets of London and having being caught out by the violence on the previous march, the Metropolitan police deployed over 1000 officers to police the demonstrations.<ref name="24 November demonstrations" />  A total of 41 people were arrested on the day with seven police officers and 11 members of the public suffering injuries.<ref name="24 November demonstrations" />  The police also came under fire for the practice of "penning in" protesters for long periods with Simon Hardy, the spokesperson for NCAFC describing the tactics as "absolutely outrageous".  He added, "that we were stuck for five or six hours, not allowed to leave, intimidated by hundreds upon hundreds of riot police and treated very badly when all we were doing was exercising our democratic right to protest I think is a real scandal."<ref name="24 November demonstrations">[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1333087/Student-protests-prompt-police-chief-warn-new-era-violence-lawless-riots-students-gear-week-protest-action.html Daily Mail | Top police chief warns of new era  of violence and lawless riots as students gear up for third week of protest action  Read more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1333087/Student-protests-prompt-police-chief-warn-new-era-violence-lawless-riots-students-gear-week-protest-action.html#ixzz17r6SWFyV]</ref>  [[Sir Paul Stephenson]], the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, said however that the "kettling" was needed as there was a danger of protesters breaking through police lines and storming the Houses of Parliament.<ref name="24 November demonstrations" />  On 30 November 2010 further protests were held in London with demonstrators congregating in Trafalgar Square as well as in other cities around the UK.<ref name="30 November protests">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11877034 BBC News | Student tuition fee protest ends with 153 arrests]</ref>  The protests in London resulted in 153 arrests and with the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts accusing the police of pre-emptively "blocking" the protest route and so keeping them in the square.  The police replied that they never had "any intention to contain the protesters."<ref name="30 November protests" />  On 9 December 2010, the day of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] vote on whether to approve measures which could see the rise in tuition fees, further demonstrations were held in London.  The protests, this time policed by 2800 officers, saw tensions running high and angry scenes as the debate on the proposals was discussed in the Commons.<ref name="Protests on day of commons vote">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11959950 BBC News | Protesters mount their last stand as fees vote nears]</ref>

===House of Commons vote===
On 9 December 2010, MPs approved raising the cap on tuition fees by a 323 to 302 vote.  The result gave the Government a Commons majority of 21.<ref name="BBC Commons vote Dec 2010">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11952449 BBC News | Plans approved despite rebellion]</ref>  The majority represented a substantial rebellion in the Government with the coalitions majority being cut by almost three quarters and with 21 Liberal Democrat and 6 Conservative MPs actually voting against the government.<ref name="BBC Commons vote Dec 2010" />  Amongst those voting no were former Lib Dem leaders [[Sir Menzies Campbell]] and [[Charles Kennedy]].  Three junior ministerial aids acting as Parliamentary Private Secretaries also chose to defy the government with Liberal Democrat aids [[Michael Crockart]], [[Jenny Willott]] voting no whilst Conservative [[Lee Scott (UK politician)|Lee Scott]] chose to abstain.  All three did so knowing that in order to defy the government whip they would also have to resign from the positions they held.<ref name="BBC Commons vote Dec 2010" />  Speaking on the governments victory Business Secretary [[Vince Cable]] said the coalition had been through a "difficult test" and added "I think the job now is to try and explain this policy to the country. It is nothing like as threatening to young people going to university as has been portrayed."<ref name="BBC Commons vote Dec 2010" />  Universities Minister [[David Willetts]] said the proposals struck the "right balance" and said "The package is fair for students, fair for graduates and affordable for the nation".<ref name="BBC Commons vote Dec 2010" />  Speaking against the proposals during the debate MP [[Greg Mulholland]] however said that sometimes governments get things wrong and added "I am voting against the government today because I simply cannot accept that fees of up to <U+00A3>9,000 are the fairest and most sustainable way of funding higher education."<ref name="BBC Commons vote Dec 2010" />  Labours shadow Business Secretary [[John Denham (politician)|John Denham]] said that the fees increase had been driven by the governments decision to make deep cuts in university funding alleging that "Even if they had just cut universities the way they are cutting other public services, students would be facing fees of no more than <U+00A3>4,000."<ref name="BBC Commons vote Dec 2010" />  Peers in the [[House of Lords]] voted to approve the plans on 14 December 2010 by a clearer majority of 283 to 215.  Speaking during the debate, the author of the report on which the government proposals were based, [[John Browne, Baron Browne of Madingley|Lord Browne]], said that he believed the reforms were "essential for this nation to maintain its hard-won pre-eminence in higher education".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/house_of_lords/newsid_9283000/9283422.stm BBC Democracy Live | Peers approve plan to raise tuition fees]</ref>
