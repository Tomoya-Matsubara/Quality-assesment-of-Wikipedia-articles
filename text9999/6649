[[Image:MarloChristmas.jpg|right]]'''''It Happened One Christmas''''' is a 1977 made-for-television movie starring [[Marlo Thomas]] and [[Wayne Rogers]].

The film, a gender-reversal remake of the classic ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', centers on Mary Bailey Hatch, a young woman who dreams of seeing the world but is forced by circumstances to remain in her small hometown as head of the family's Building & Loan business. In a moment of financial crisis, a severely depressed Mary contemplates [[suicide]] but is rescued by her [[guardian angel]], Clara Oddbody, who shows her the positive effect she's had on everyone she's met throughout her life.

[[Lionel Chetwynd]]'s teleplay, directed by [[Donald Wrye]], varies little from the original screenplay, even using most of the original dialogue. The supporting cast includes [[Orson Welles]], [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Doris Roberts]], [[Christopher Guest]], [[C. Thomas Howell]], and [[Barney Martin]].

Leachman received an [[Emmy Award]] nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Supporting Actress in a Drama or Comedy Special.

Thomas served as executive producer for the project. The remake was broadcast at a time when the original film rarely was aired on television, and many viewers were unfamiliar with its source. Once the [[James Stewart (actor)|James Stewart]]-[[Donna Reed]] version returned to the airwaves on an annual basis, the remake slipped into obscurity.  

The film had its premiere on Sunday, December 11, 1977, and was one of the very rare instances when the ''[[ABC Sunday Night Movie]]'' showcased a [[made-for-television]] film rather than one that had been shown in theatres. It was successful enough to be re-broadcast in 1978, but by that time, the original ''It's A Wonderful Life'' had begun its "resurgence" on television, and eventually displaced ''It Happened One Christmas''.

''It Happened One Christmas'' is rarely shown today, and has not, as of 2009, been issued on DVD.
