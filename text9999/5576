{{Campaignbox Norman Conquest}}

The '''Norman conquest of England''' was the 11th-century invasion and occupation of [[England]] by an army of [[Normans|Norman]], [[Breton people|Breton]], and [[French people|French]] soldiers led by Duke William II of [[Normandy]], later [[William the Conqueror]].

William's claim to the English throne derived from his familial relationship with the childless [[Anglo-Saxon]] King [[Edward the Confessor]], who may have encouraged William's hopes for the throne. Edward died in January 1066 and was succeeded by his brother-in-law [[Harold Godwinson]]. The Norwegian king [[Harald Hardrada]] invaded northern England in September 1066, was victorious at the [[Battle of Fulford]], but Harold defeated and killed him at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] on 25 September 1066. Within days, William landed in southern England. Harold marched south to confront him, leaving a significant portion of his army in the north. Harold's army confronted William's invaders on 14 October at the [[Battle of Hastings]]; William's force defeated Harold, who was killed in the engagement.

Although William's main rivals were gone, he still faced rebellions over the following years and was not secure on his throne until after 1072. The lands of the resisting English elite were confiscated; some of the elite fled into exile. To control his new kingdom, William gave lands to his followers and built [[castle]]s commanding military strongpoints throughout the land. Other effects of the conquest included the [[Noble court|court]] and government, the introduction of [[Norman French]] as the language of the elites, and changes in the composition of the upper classes, as William [[Enfeoffment|enfeoffed]] lands to be held directly from the king. More gradual changes affected the agricultural classes and village life: the main change appears to have been the formal elimination of slavery, which may or may not have been linked to the invasion. There was little alteration in the structure of government, as the new Norman administrators took over many of the forms of Anglo-Saxon government.

==Origins==
[[File:Rollo spol.jpg|thumb|13th-century depiction of Rollo and his descendants William I of Normandy and Richard I of Normandy|upright|right]]
In 911 the French [[Carolingian]] ruler [[Charles the Simple]] allowed a group of [[Vikings]] under their leader [[Rollo of Normandy|Rollo]] to settle in [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] as part of the [[Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte]]. In exchange for the land, the Norsemen under Rollo were expected to provide protection along the coast against further Viking invaders.<ref name=Bates8>Bates ''Normandy Before 1066'' pp. 8<U+2013>10</ref> Their settlement proved successful, and the Vikings in the region became known as the "Northmen" from which "Normandy" and "Normans" are derived.<ref name=Normans15>Crouch ''Normans'' pp. 15<U+2013>16</ref> The Normans quickly adopted the indigenous culture, renouncing [[paganism]] and converting to [[Christianity]].<ref name=Bates12>Bates ''Normandy Before 1066'' p. 12</ref> They adopted the [[langues d'o<U+00EF>l|langue d'o<U+00EF>l]] of their new home and added features from their own [[Old Norse language|Norse language]], transforming it into the [[Norman language]]. They intermarried with the local population<ref name=Bates20>Bates ''Normandy Before 1066'' pp. 20<U+2013>21</ref> and used the territory granted them as a base to extend the frontiers of the duchy westward, annexing territory including the [[Bessin]], the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] and [[Avranches]].<ref name=Capet53>Hallam and Everard ''Capetian France'' p. 53</ref>

In 1002 King [[<U+00C6>thelred the Unready|<U+00C6>thelred II of England]] married [[Emma of Normandy|Emma]], the sister of  [[Richard II, Duke of Normandy]].<ref name=Unready54>Williams ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'' p. 54</ref> Their son [[Edward the Confessor]], who spent many years in exile in Normandy, succeeded to the English throne in 1042.<ref name=Ruling3>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 3</ref> This led to the establishment of a powerful Norman interest in English politics, as Edward drew heavily on his former hosts for support, bringing in Norman courtiers, soldiers, and clerics and appointing them to positions of power, particularly in the Church. Childless and embroiled in conflict with the formidable [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex]], and his sons, Edward may also have encouraged Duke William of Normandy's ambitions for the English throne.<ref name=Unification86>Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' pp. 86<U+2013>99</ref>

When King Edward died at the beginning of 1066, the lack of a clear heir led to a disputed succession in which several contenders laid claim to the throne of England.<ref name=Death167>Higham ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 167<U+2013>181</ref> Edward's immediate successor was the [[Earl of Wessex]], Harold Godwinson, the richest and most powerful of the English aristocrats. Harold was elected king by the [[Witenagemot]] of England and crowned by [[Ealdred (archbishop of York)|the Archbishop of York, Ealdred]], although Norman propaganda claimed the ceremony was performed by [[Stigand]], the [[canon law|uncanonically]] elected [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref name=Death167/><ref name=Walker136>Walker ''Harold'' pp. 136<U+2013>138</ref> Harold was immediately challenged by two powerful neighbouring rulers. Duke William claimed that he had been promised the throne by King Edward and that Harold had sworn agreement to this;<ref name=BatesWilliam73>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 73<U+2013>77</ref> King Harald III of Norway, commonly known as Harald Hardrada, also contested the succession. His claim to the throne was based on an agreement between his predecessor [[Magnus I of Norway]] and the earlier English king, [[Harthacnut]], whereby if either died without heir, the other would inherit both England and Norway.<ref name=Death188>Higham ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 188<U+2013>190</ref>{{efn|Harthacnut was the son of King [[Cnut the Great]] and Emma of Norway, and thus was the half-brother of Edward the Confessor. He reigned from 1040 to 1042, and died without children.<ref name=Harthacnut>Keynes "Harthacnut" ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England''</ref> Harthacnut's father Cnut had defeated <U+00C6>thelred's son [[Edmund II of England|Edmund Ironside]] in 1016 to claim the English throne and marry <U+00C6>thelred's widow, Emma.<ref name=Conquest84>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 84</ref> After Harthacnut's death in 1042, Magnus began preparations for an invasion of England, which was only stopped by his death in 1047.<ref name=Stenton423>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 423<U+2013>424</ref>}} William and Harald at once set about assembling troops and ships to invade England.<ref name=Ruling12>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 12<U+2013>14</ref>{{efn|Other contenders later came to the fore. The first was [[Edgar <U+00C6>theling]], Edward the Confessor's great nephew who was a patrilineal descendant of King [[Edmund II of England|Edmund Ironside]]. He was the son of Edward the Exile, son of Edmund Ironside, and was born in Hungary, where his father had fled after the conquest of England by [[Canute the Great|Cnut]]. After his family's eventual return to England and his father's death in 1057,<ref name=Huscroft96>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 96<U+2013>97</ref> Edgar had by far the strongest hereditary claim to the throne, but he was only about thirteen or fourteen at the time of Edward the Confessor's death, and with little family to support him, his claim was passed over by the [[Witan]].<ref name=Huscroft132>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 132<U+2013>133</ref> Another contender was [[Sweyn II of Denmark]], who had a claim to the throne as the grandson of [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Sweyn Forkbeard]] and nephew of [[Canute the Great|Cnut]],<ref name=Stafford86>Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' pp. 86<U+2013>87</ref> but he did not make his bid for the throne until 1069.<ref name=Bates103>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 103<U+2013>104</ref> [[Tostig Godwinson]]'s attacks in early 1066 may have been the beginning of a bid for the throne, but after defeat at the hands of [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Edwin]] and [[Morcar of Northumbria|Morcar]] and the desertion of most of his followers he threw his lot in with Harald Hardrada.<ref name=Thomas33>Thomas ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 33<U+2013>34</ref>}}

==Tostig's raids and the Norwegian invasion==
{{Main|Battle of Stamford Bridge}}
In early 1066 Harold's exiled brother [[Tostig Godwinson]] raided southeastern England with a fleet he had recruited in [[Flanders]], later joined by other ships from [[Orkney]].{{efn|Tostig, who had been [[Earl of Northumbria]], was expelled from that office by a Northumbrian rebellion in late 1065. After King Edward sided with the rebels, Tostig went into exile in Flanders.<ref name=Stenton578>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 578<U+2013>580</ref>}} Threatened by Harold's fleet, Tostig moved north and raided in [[East Anglia]] and [[Lincolnshire]], but he was driven back to his ships by the brothers [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia]], and [[Morcar of Northumbria|Morcar, Earl of Northumbria]]. Deserted by most of his followers, he withdrew to Scotland, where he spent the summer recruiting fresh forces.<ref name=Harold144>Walker ''Harold'' pp. 144<U+2013>145</ref>{{efn|The King of Scotland, [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm III]], is said to have been Tostig's sworn brother.<ref name=Stenton578/>}} King Harold spent the summer on the south coast with a large army and fleet waiting for William to invade, but the bulk of his forces were militia who needed to harvest their crops, so on 8 September Harold dismissed them.<ref name=Harold145>Walker ''Harold'' pp. 144<U+2013>150</ref>

King Harald Hardrada invaded northern England in early September, leading a fleet of more than 300 ships carrying perhaps 15,000 men. Harald's army was further augmented by the forces of Tostig, who threw his support behind the Norwegian king's bid for the throne. Advancing on York, the Norwegians occupied the city after defeating a northern English army under Edwin and Morcar on 20 September at the [[Battle of Fulford]].<ref name=Harold154>Walker ''Harold'' pp. 154<U+2013>158</ref> The two earls had rushed to engage the Norwegian forces before King Harold could arrive from the south. Although Harold Godwinson had married Edwin and Morcar's sister [[Ealdgyth, daughter of Earl <U+00C6>lfgar|Ealdgyth]], the two earls may have distrusted Harold and feared that the king would replace Morcar with Tostig. The end result was that their forces were devastated and unable to participate in the rest of the campaigns of 1066, although the two earls survived the battle.<ref name=Marren65>Marren ''1066'' pp. 65<U+2013>71</ref>

Hardrada moved on to York, which surrendered to him. After taking hostages from the leading men of the city, on 24 September the Norwegians moved east to the tiny village of [[Stamford Bridge, East Riding of Yorkshire|Stamford Bridge]].<ref name=Marren73>Marren ''1066'' p. 73</ref> King Harold probably learned of the Norwegian invasion in mid-September and rushed north, gathering forces as he went.<ref name=Harold158/> The royal forces likely took nine days to cover the distance from London to York, averaging almost {{convert|25|mi|km|abbr=off}} per day.  At dawn on 25 September Harold's forces reached York, where he learned the location of the Norwegians.<ref name=Marren74>Marren ''1066'' pp. 74<U+2013>75</ref> The English then marched on the invaders and took them by surprise, defeating them in the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]].  Harald of Norway and Tostig were killed, and the Norwegians suffered such horrific losses that only 24 of the original 300 ships were required to carry away the survivors. The English victory was costly, as Harold's army was left in a battered and weakened state.<ref name=Harold158>Walker ''Harold'' pp. 158<U+2013>165</ref>

==Norman invasion==

===Norman preparations and forces===
William assembled a large invasion fleet and an army gathered from Normandy and all over France, including large contingents from [[Brittany]] and Flanders.<ref name=Bates79/> He mustered his forces at [[Saint-Valery-sur-Somme]] and was ready to cross the Channel by about 12 August.<ref name=Douglas192>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 192</ref> The exact numbers and composition of William's force are unknown.<ref name=Gravett20>Gravett ''Hastings'' pp. 20<U+2013>21</ref> A contemporary document claims that William had 726 ships, but this may be an inflated figure.<ref name=Bennett25>Bennett ''Campaigns of the Norman Conquest'' p. 25</ref> Figures given by contemporary writers are highly exaggerated, varying from 14,000 to 150,000 men.<ref name=Lawson163>Lawson ''Battle of Hastings'' pp. 163<U+2013>164</ref> Modern historians have offered a range of estimates for the size of William's forces: 7000<U+2013>8000 men, 1000<U+2013>2000 of them cavalry;<ref name=Bennet26>Bennett ''Campaigns of the Norman Conquest'' p. 26</ref> 10,000<U+2013>12,000 men;<ref name=Lawson163/> 10,000 men, 3000 of them cavalry;<ref name=Marren89>Marren ''1066'' pp. 89<U+2013>90</ref> or 7500 men.<ref name=Gravett20/> The army would have consisted of a mix of cavalry, infantry, and archers or crossbowmen, with about equal numbers of cavalry and archers and the foot soldiers equal in number to the other two types combined.<ref name=Gravett27>Gravett ''Hastings'' p. 27</ref> Although later lists of [[companions of William the Conqueror]] are extant, most are padded with extra names; only about 35 individuals can be reliably claimed to have been with William at Hastings.<ref name=Gravett20/><ref name=Marren108>Marren ''1066'' pp. 108<U+2013>109</ref>{{efn|Of those 35, 5 are known to have died in the battle&nbsp;<U+2013> Robert of Vitot, Engenulf of Laigle, Robert fitzErneis, Roger son of Turold, and Taillefer.<ref name=Marren107>Marren ''1066'' pp. 107<U+2013>108</ref>}}

William of Poitiers states that William obtained Pope [[Pope Alexander II|Alexander II]]'s consent for the invasion, signified by a papal banner, along with diplomatic support from other European rulers. Although Alexander did give papal approval to the conquest after it succeeded, no other source claims papal support before the invasion.{{efn|The [[Bayeux Tapestry]] may possibly depict a papal banner carried by William's forces, but this is not named as such in the tapestry.<ref name=Huscroft120/>}} William's army assembled during the summer while an invasion fleet in Normandy was constructed. Although the army and fleet were ready by early August, adverse winds kept the ships in Normandy until late September. There were probably other reasons for William's delay, including intelligence reports from England revealing that Harold's forces were deployed along the coast. William would have preferred to delay the invasion until he could make an unopposed landing.<ref name=Huscroft120>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 120<U+2013>123</ref>

===Landing and Harold's march south===
[[File:BayeuxTapestryScene39.jpg|Landing in England scene from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], depicting ships coming in and horses landing|thumb|left]]
The Normans crossed to England a few days after Harold's victory over the Norwegians, following the dispersal of Harold's naval force. They landed at [[Pevensey]] in Sussex on 28 September and erected a wooden castle at [[Hastings]], from which they raided the surrounding area.<ref name=Bates79>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 79<U+2013>89</ref> This ensured supplies for the army, and as many of the lands in the area were held by Harold and his family, it weakened William's opponent and made him more likely to attack to put an end to the raiding.<ref name=Marren98>Marren ''1066'' p. 98</ref>

Harold, after defeating his brother Tostig and Harald Hardrada in the north, left much of his force there, including Morcar and Edwin, and marched the rest of his army south to deal with the threatened Norman invasion.<ref name=Carpenter72>Carpenter ''Struggle for Mastery'' p. 72</ref> It is unclear when Harold learned of William's landing, but it was probably while he was travelling south. Harold stopped in London for about a week before reaching Hastings, so it is likely that he took a second week to march south, averaging about {{convert|27|mi|km|abbr=off}} per day,<ref name=Marren93>Marren ''1066'' p. 93</ref> for the nearly {{convert|200|mi|km|abbr=off}} to London.<ref name=Huscroft124>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 124</ref> Although Harold attempted to surprise the Normans, William's scouts reported the English arrival to the duke. The exact events preceding the battle are obscure, with contradictory accounts in the sources, but all agree that William led his army from his castle and advanced towards the enemy.<ref name=Lawson180>Lawson ''Battle of Hastings'' pp. 180<U+2013>182</ref> Harold had taken a defensive position at the top of Senlac Hill (present-day [[Battle, East Sussex]]), about {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=off|sigfig=1}} from William's castle at Hastings.<ref name=Marren99>Marren ''1066'' pp. 99<U+2013>100</ref>

The size and composition of Harold's army is not reliably given in contemporary sources, although two Norman sources give figures of 1.2&nbsp;million or 400,000 men.<ref name=Lawson128>Lawson ''Battle of Hastings'' p. 128</ref> Recent historians have suggested figures of between 5000 and 13,000 for Harold's army at Hastings,<ref name=Lawson130>Lawson ''Battle of Hastings'' pp. 130<U+2013>133</ref> but most agree on a range of between 7000 and 8000 English troops.<ref name=Gravett28>Gravett ''Hastings'' pp. 28<U+2013>34</ref><ref name=Marren105>Marren ''1066'' p. 105</ref> These men would have been a mix of the ''[[fyrd]]'', or militia mainly composed of foot soldiers, and the ''[[housecarls]]'', or nobleman's personal troops, who usually also fought on foot. The main difference between the two types was in their armour; the ''housecarls'' used better protecting armour than that of the ''fyrd''. The English army does not appear to have had many archers, although some were present.<ref name=Gravett28/> Few individual Englishmen are known to have been at Hastings; the most important were Harold's brothers [[Gyrth]] and [[Leofwine Godwinson|Leofwine]].<ref name=Gravett20/> About 18 other named individuals can reasonably be assumed to have fought with Harold at Hastings, including two of his other relatives.<ref name=Marren107/>{{efn|Of these named persons, eight died in the battle&nbsp;<U+2013> Harold, Gyrth, Leofwine, Godric the sheriff, Thurkill of Berkshire, Breme, and someone known only as "son of Helloc".<ref name=Marren107/>}}

===Hastings===
{{Main|Battle of Hastings}}
[[File:Bayeuxtapestrydeathofharold.jpg|Depiction of Harold's death from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}|thumb|right]]

The battle began at about 9&nbsp;am on 14 October and lasted all day, but while a broad outline is known, the exact events are obscured by contradictory accounts in the sources.<ref name=Huscroft126>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 126</ref> Although the numbers on each side were probably about equal, William had both cavalry and infantry, including many archers, while Harold had only foot soldiers and few archers.<ref name=Carpenter73>Carpenter  ''Struggle for Mastery'' p. 73</ref> The English soldiers formed up as a [[shield wall]] along the ridge, and were at first so effective that William's army was thrown back with heavy casualties. Some of William's Breton troops panicked and fled, and some of the English troops appear to have pursued the fleeing Bretons. Norman cavalry then attacked and killed the pursuing troops. While the Bretons were fleeing, rumours swept the Norman forces that the duke had been killed, but William rallied his troops. Twice more the Normans made [[Withdrawal (military)#Feigned retreat|feigned withdrawal]]s, tempting the English into pursuit, and allowing the Norman cavalry to attack them repeatedly.<ref name=Huscroft127>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 127<U+2013>128</ref> The available sources are more confused about events in the afternoon, but it appears that the decisive event was the death of Harold, about which differing stories are told. William of Jumieges claimed that Harold was killed by the duke. The Bayeux Tapestry has been claimed to show Harold's death by an arrow to the eye, but this may be a later reworking of the tapestry to conform to 12th-century stories that Harold had died from an arrow wound to the head.<ref name=Huscroft129>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 129</ref> Other sources stated that no one knew how Harold died because the press of battle was so tight around the king that the soldiers could not see who struck the fatal blow.<ref name=Marren137>Marren ''1066'' p. 137</ref> [[William of Poitiers]] gives no details at all about Harold's death.<ref name=Gravett77>Gravett ''Hastings'' p. 77</ref>

===Aftermath of Hastings===

The day after the battle, Harold's body was identified, either by his armour or marks on his body.{{efn|A 12th-century tradition stated that Harold's face could not be recognised and [[Edith the Fair]], Harold's [[Common-law marriage|common-law wife]], was brought to the battlefield to identify his body from marks that only she knew.<ref name=Gravett80>Gravett ''Hastings'' p. 80</ref>}} The bodies of the English dead, who included some of Harold's brothers and his ''housecarls'', were left on the battlefield,<ref name=Huscroft131/> although some were removed by relatives later.<ref name=Gravett81>Gravett ''Hastings'' p. 81</ref> [[Gytha Thorkelsd<U+00F3>ttir|Gytha]], Harold's mother, offered the victorious duke the weight of her son's body in gold for its custody, but her offer was refused. William ordered that Harold's body was to be thrown into the sea, but whether that took place is unclear.<ref name=Huscroft131/> Another story relates that Harold was buried at the top of a cliff.<ref name=Marren146>Marren ''1066'' p. 146</ref> [[Waltham Abbey (abbey)|Waltham Abbey]], which had been founded by Harold, later claimed that his body had been buried there secretly.<ref name=Huscroft131>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 131</ref> Later legends claimed that Harold did not die at Hastings, but escaped and became a hermit at Chester.<ref name=Gravett81/>

After his victory at Hastings, William expected to receive the submission of the surviving English leaders, but instead [[Edgar the <U+00C6>theling]]{{efn|<U+00C6>theling is the Anglo-Saxon term for a royal prince with some claim to the throne.<ref name=Bennett91>Bennett ''Campaigns of the Norman Conquest'' p. 91</ref>}} was proclaimed king by the Witenagemot, with the support of Earls Edwin and Morcar, Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and [[Ealdred (bishop)|Ealdred]], the Archbishop of York.<ref name=Douglas204>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 204<U+2013>205</ref> William therefore advanced, marching around the coast of [[Kent]] to London. He defeated an English force that attacked him at [[Southwark]], but being unable to storm [[London Bridge]] he sought to reach the capital by a more circuitous route.<ref name=Douglas205>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 205<U+2013>206</ref>

William moved up the [[Thames]] valley to cross the river at [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], Berkshire; while there he received the submission of Stigand. He then travelled north-east along the [[Chilterns]], before advancing towards London from the north-west, fighting further engagements against forces from the city. Having failed to muster an effective military response, Edgar's leading supporters lost their nerve, and the English leaders surrendered to William at [[Berkhamsted]], Hertfordshire. William was acclaimed King of England and crowned by Ealdred on 25 December 1066, in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref name=Douglas205/>{{efn|The coronation was marred when the Norman troops stationed outside the abbey heard the sounds of those inside acclaiming the king and began burning nearby houses, thinking the noises were signs of a riot.<ref name=Gravett84>Gravett ''Hastings'' p. 84</ref>}} The new king attempted to conciliate the remaining English nobility by confirming Morcar, Edwin and [[Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria|Waltheof, the Earl of Northumbria]], in their lands as well as giving some land to Edgar the <U+00C6>theling. William remained in England until March 1067, when he returned to Normandy with English prisoners, including Stigand, Morcar, Edwin, Edgar the <U+00C6>theling, and Waltheof.<ref name=Huscroft138>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 138<U+2013>139</ref>

==English resistance==

===Revolts of 1069===
{{Main|Harrying of the North}}
[[File:Baile Hill, York.JPG|The remains of the second motte-and-bailey castle built by William in York|thumb|left]]

Early in 1069 the newly installed Norman Earl of Northumbria, [[Robert Comine|Robert de Comines]], and several hundred soldiers accompanying him were massacred at Durham; the Northumbrian rebellion was joined by Edgar, Gospatric, [[Siward Barn]] and other rebels who had taken refuge in Scotland. The castellan of York, Robert fitzRichard, was defeated and killed, and the rebels besieged the Norman castle at York. William hurried north with an army, defeated the rebels outside York and pursued them into the city, massacring the inhabitants and bringing the revolt to an end.<ref name=Williams27>Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' pp. 27<U+2013>34</ref> He built a second castle at York, strengthened Norman forces in Northumbria and then returned south. A subsequent local uprising was crushed by the garrison of York.<ref name=Williams27/> Harold's sons launched a second raid from Ireland and were defeated in Devon by Norman forces under Count Brian, a son of [[Eudes, Count of Penthi<U+00E8>vre]].<ref name=Williams35>Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 35</ref> In August or September 1069 a large fleet sent by [[Sweyn II of Denmark]] arrived off the coast of England, sparking a new wave of rebellions across the country. After abortive raids in the south, the Danes joined forces with a new Northumbrian uprising, which was also joined by Edgar, Gospatric and the other exiles from Scotland as well as Waltheof. The combined Danish and English forces defeated the Norman garrison at York, seized the castles and took control of Northumbria, although a raid into Lincolnshire led by Edgar was defeated by the Norman garrison of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]].<ref name=Williams35a>Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' pp. 35<U+2013>41</ref>

At the same time resistance flared up again in western Mercia, where the forces of Eadric the Wild, together with his Welsh allies and further rebel forces from [[Cheshire]] and Shropshire, attacked the castle at [[Shrewsbury]]. In the south-west, rebels from Devon and Cornwall attacked the Norman garrison at Exeter, but were repulsed by the defenders and scattered by a Norman relief force under Count Brian. Other rebels from [[Dorset]], Somerset and neighbouring areas besieged [[Montacute Castle]] but were defeated by a Norman army gathered from London, [[Winchester]] and [[Salisbury, United Kingdom|Salisbury]] under [[Geoffrey de Montbray|Geoffrey of Coutances]].<ref name=Williams35a/> Meanwhile William attacked the Danes, who had moored for the winter south of the Humber in Lincolnshire, and drove them back to the north bank. Leaving [[Robert of Mortain]] in charge of Lincolnshire, he turned west and defeated the Mercian rebels in battle at [[Stafford]]. When the Danes attempted to return to Lincolnshire, the Norman forces there again drove them back across the Humber. William advanced into Northumbria, defeating an attempt to block his crossing of the swollen [[River Aire]] at [[Pontefract]]. The Danes fled at his approach, and he occupied York. He bought off the Danes, who agreed to leave England in the spring, and during the winter of 1069<U+2013>70 his forces systematically devastated Northumbria in the [[Harrying of the North]], subduing all resistance.<ref name=Williams35a/> As a symbol of his renewed authority over the north, William ceremonially wore his crown at York on Christmas Day 1069.<ref name=Huscroft142/>

In early 1070, having secured the submission of Waltheof and Gospatric, and driven Edgar and his remaining supporters back to Scotland, William returned to Mercia, where he based himself at Chester and crushed all remaining resistance in the area before returning to the south.<ref name=Williams35a/> [[Papal legate]]s arrived and at Easter re-crowned William, which would have symbolically reasserted his right to the kingdom. William also oversaw a purge of prelates from the Church, most notably Stigand, who was deposed from Canterbury. The papal legates also imposed penances on William and those of his supporters who had taken part in Hastings and the subsequent campaigns.<ref name=Huscroft145>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 145<U+2013>146</ref> As well as Canterbury, the [[see of York]] had become vacant following the death of Ealdred in September 1069. Both sees were filled by men loyal to William: [[Lanfranc]], abbot of William's foundation at [[Abbey of Saint-<U+00C9>tienne, Caen|Caen]] received Canterbury while [[Thomas of Bayeux]], one of William's chaplains, was installed at York. Some other bishoprics and abbeys also received new bishops and abbots and William confiscated some of the wealth of the English monasteries, which had served as repositories for the assets of the native nobles.<ref name=Bennett56>Bennett ''Campaigns of the Norman Conquest'' p. 56</ref>

===Danish troubles===
[[File:Coin king of denmark sven estridsen.jpg|Coin of Sweyn II of Denmark|thumb|right]]

In 1070 Sweyn II of Denmark arrived to take personal command of his fleet and renounced the earlier agreement to withdraw, sending troops into [[the Fens]] to join forces with English rebels led by [[Hereward the Wake]],{{efn|Although the [[epithet]] "the Wake" has been claimed to be derived from "the wakeful one", the first use of the epithet is from the mid-13th century, and is thus unlikely to have been contemporary.<ref name=HerewardDNB>Roffe "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13074 Hereward (fl. 1070<U+2013>1071)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>}} based on the [[Isle of Ely]]. Sweyn soon accepted a further payment of [[Danegeld]] from William, and returned home.<ref name=Douglas221>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 221<U+2013>222</ref> After the departure of the Danes the Fenland rebels remained at large, protected by the marshes, and early in 1071 there was a final outbreak of rebel activity in the area. Edwin and Morcar again turned against William, and although Edwin was quickly betrayed and killed, Morcar reached [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]], where he and Hereward were joined by exiled rebels who had sailed from Scotland. William arrived with an army and a fleet to finish off this last pocket of resistance. After some costly failures the Normans managed to construct a pontoon to reach the Isle of Ely, defeated the rebels at the bridgehead and stormed the island, marking the effective end of English resistance.<ref name=Williams49>Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' pp. 49<U+2013>57</ref> Morcar was imprisoned for the rest of his life; Hereward was pardoned and had his lands returned to him.<ref name=Huscroft146>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 146<U+2013>147</ref>

===Last resistance===
{{main|Revolt of the Earls}}

William faced difficulties in his continental possessions in 1071,<ref name=Douglas225>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 225<U+2013>226</ref> but in 1072 he returned to England and marched north to confront King [[Malcolm III of Scotland]].{{efn|Malcolm, in 1069 or 1070, had married [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]], sister of Edgar the <U+00C6>theling.<ref name=Huscroft142/>}} This campaign, which included a land army supported by a fleet, resulted in the [[Treaty of Abernethy]] in which Malcolm expelled Edgar the <U+00C6>theling from Scotland and agreed to some degree of subordination to William.<ref name=Huscroft146/> The exact status of this subordination was unclear&nbsp;<U+2013> the treaty merely stated that Malcolm became William's man. Whether this meant only for Cumbria and Lothian or for the whole Scottish kingdom was left ambiguous.<ref name=Douglas227>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 227</ref>

In 1075, during William's absence, [[Ralph de Gael]], the [[Earl of Norfolk]], and [[Roger de Breteuil, 2nd Earl of Hereford]], conspired to overthrow him in the [[Revolt of the Earls]].<ref name=Douglas231/> The exact reason for the rebellion is unclear, but it was launched at the wedding of Ralph to a relative of Roger's, held at [[Exning]]. Another earl, Waltheof, despite being one of William's favourites, was also involved, and some Breton lords were ready to offer support. Ralph also requested Danish aid. William remained in Normandy while his men in England subdued the revolt. Roger was unable to leave his stronghold in Herefordshire because of efforts by [[Wulfstan (died 1095)|Wulfstan]], the [[Bishop of Worcester]], and [[<U+00C6>thelwig]], the [[Abbot of Evesham]]. Ralph was bottled up in [[Norwich Castle]] by the combined efforts of Odo of Bayeux, Geoffrey of Coutances, [[Richard fitz Gilbert|Richard fitzGilbert]], and [[William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey|William de Warenne]]. Norwich was besieged and surrendered, and Ralph went into exile. Meanwhile, the Danish king's brother, [[Canute IV of Denmark|Cnut]], had finally arrived in England with a fleet of 200 ships, but he was too late as Norwich had already surrendered. The Danes then raided along the coast before returning home.<ref name=Douglas231/> William did not return to England until later in 1075, to deal with the Danish threat and the aftermath of the rebellion, celebrating Christmas at Winchester.<ref name=Bates181>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 181<U+2013>182</ref> Roger and Waltheof were kept in prison, where Waltheof was executed in May 1076. By that time William had returned to the continent, where Ralph was continuing the rebellion from Brittany.<ref name=Douglas231>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 231<U+2013>233</ref>

==Control of England==
[[File:Londres 297..jpg|The Tower of London, originally begun by William the Conqueror to control London<ref name=Douglas216>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 216 and footnote 4</ref>|thumb|upright|left]]

Once England had been conquered, the Normans faced many challenges in maintaining control.<ref name=Stafford102>Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' pp. 102<U+2013>105</ref>  They were few in number compared to the native English population; including those from other parts of France, historians estimate the number of Norman settlers at around 8000.<ref name=Mastery82>Carpenter ''Struggle for Mastery'' pp. 82<U+2013>83</ref> William's followers expected and received lands and titles in return for their service in the invasion,<ref name=Mastery79>Carpenter ''Struggle for Mastery'' pp. 79<U+2013>80</ref> but William claimed ultimate possession of the land in England over which his armies had given him ''de facto'' control, and asserted the right to dispose of it as he saw fit.<ref name=Mastery84/> Henceforth, all land was "held" directly from the king in [[Feudal land tenure|feudal tenure]] in return for military service.<ref name=Mastery84>Carpenter ''Struggle for Mastery'' p. 84</ref> A Norman lord typically had properties located in a piecemeal fashion throughout England and Normandy, and not in a single geographic block.<ref name=Mastery83>Carpenter ''Struggle for Mastery'' pp. 83<U+2013>84</ref>

To find the lands to compensate his Norman followers, William initially confiscated the estates of all the English lords who had fought and died with Harold and redistributed part of their lands.<ref name=Mastery75>Carpenter ''Struggle for Mastery'' pp. 75<U+2013>76</ref> These confiscations led to revolts, which resulted in more confiscations, a cycle that continued for five years after the Battle of Hastings.<ref name=Mastery79/> To put down and prevent further rebellions the Normans constructed castles and fortifications in unprecedented numbers,<ref name=Chibnall11>Chibnall ''Anglo-Norman England'' pp. 11<U+2013>13</ref> initially mostly on the [[motte-and-bailey]] pattern.<ref name=Forts110>Kaufman and Kaufman ''Medieval Fortress'' p. 110</ref> Historian Robert Liddiard remarks that "to glance at the urban landscape of Norwich, Durham or Lincoln is to be forcibly reminded of the impact of the Norman invasion".<ref>Liddiard ''Castles in Context'' p. 36</ref> William and his barons also exercised tighter control over inheritance of property by widows and daughters, often forcing marriages to Normans.<ref name=Mastery89>Carpenter ''Struggle for Mastery'' p. 89</ref>

A measure of William's success in taking control is that, from 1072 until the [[Battle of Bouvines|Capetian conquest]] of Normandy in 1204, William and his successors were largely absentee rulers.  For example, after 1072, William spent more than 75 per cent of his time in France rather than England.  While he needed to be personally present in Normandy to defend the realm from foreign invasion and put down internal revolts, he set up royal administrative structures that enabled him to rule England from a distance.<ref name=Mastery91>Carpenter ''Struggle for Mastery'' p. 91</ref>

==Consequences==

===Elite replacement===
A direct consequence of the invasion was the almost total elimination of the old English aristocracy and the loss of English control over the [[Catholic Church]] in England. William systematically dispossessed English landowners and conferred their property on his continental followers. The ''[[Domesday Book]]'' meticulously documents the impact of this colossal programme of expropriation, revealing that by 1086 only about 5 per cent of land in England south of the [[Tees]] was left in English hands. Even this tiny residue was further diminished in the decades that followed, the elimination of native landholding being most complete in southern parts of the country.<ref>Thomas ''English and Normans'' pp. 105<U+2013>137</ref><ref>Thomas "Significance" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 303<U+2013>333</ref>

Natives were also removed from high governmental and ecclesiastical office. After 1075 all earldoms were held by Normans, and Englishmen were only occasionally appointed as sheriffs. Likewise in the Church, senior English office-holders were either expelled from their positions or kept in place for their lifetimes and replaced by foreigners when they died. By 1096 no bishopric was held by any Englishman, and English abbots became uncommon, especially in the larger monasteries.<ref>Thomas ''English and Normans'' pp. 202<U+2013>208</ref>

===English emigration===

[[File:Skylitzis Chronicle VARANGIAN GUARD.jpg|Depiction of the [[Varangian Guard]] from the 12th-century [[Madrid Skylitzes]]|thumb|right]]
Following the conquest, many Anglo-Saxons, including groups of nobles, fled the country<ref name= Byzantium>Ciggaar ''Western Travellers'' pp. 140<U+2013>141</ref> for Scotland, Ireland, or Scandinavia.<ref name= Daniell>Daniell ''From Norman Conquest to Magna Carta'' pp. 13<U+2013>14</ref> Members of King Harold Godwinson's family sought refuge in Ireland and used their bases in that country for unsuccessful invasions of England.<ref name=Huscroft140>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 140<U+2013>141</ref> The largest single exodus occurred in the 1070s, when a group of Anglo-Saxons in a fleet of 235 ships sailed for the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref name= Daniell/> The empire became a popular destination for many English nobles and soldiers, as the Byzantines were in need of mercenaries.<ref name= Byzantium/> The English became the predominant element in the elite [[Varangian Guard]], hitherto a largely Scandinavian unit, from which the emperor's bodyguard was drawn.<ref>Heath ''Byzantine Armies'' p. 23</ref> Some of the English migrants were settled in Byzantine frontier regions on the [[Black Sea]] coast, and established towns with names such as New London and New York.<ref name= Byzantium/>

===Governmental systems===
[[File:Domesday book--w.jpg|thumb|upright|Page from the Warwickshire Domesday survey|left]]
Before the Normans arrived, Anglo-Saxon governmental systems were more sophisticated than their counterparts in Normandy.<ref name=Thomas59>Thomas ''Norman Conquest'' p. 59</ref><ref name=Conquest187>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 187</ref> All of England was divided into administrative units called [[shire]]s, with subdivisions; the royal court was the centre of government, and royal courts existed to secure the rights of free men.<ref name=Govern176>Loyn ''Governance of Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 176</ref> Shires were run by officials known as shire [[reeve (England)|reeve]]s or [[sheriff]]s.<ref name=Thomas60>Thomas ''Norman Conquest'' p. 60</ref> Most medieval governments were always on the move, holding court wherever the weather and food or other matters were best at the moment;<ref name=Conquest31>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 31</ref> England had a permanent treasury at [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]] before William's conquest.<ref name=Conquest194>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 194<U+2013>195</ref> One major reason for the strength of the English monarchy was the wealth of the kingdom, built on the English system of taxation that included a land tax, or the geld. English coinage was also superior to most of the other currency in use in northwestern Europe, and the ability to mint coins was a royal monopoly.<ref name=Conquest36>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 36<U+2013>37</ref> The English kings had also developed the system of issuing [[writ]]s to their officials, in addition to the normal medieval practice of issuing [[charter]]s.<ref name=Conquest198>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 198<U+2013>199</ref> Writs were either instructions to an official or group of officials, or notifications of royal actions such as appointments to office or a grant of some sort.<ref name=Writ>Keynes "Charters and Writs" ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 100</ref>

This sophisticated medieval form of government was handed over to the Normans and was the foundation of further developments.<ref name=Govern176/> They kept the framework of government but made changes in the personnel, although at first the new king attempted to keep some natives in office. By the end of William's reign most of the officials of government and the royal household were Normans. The language of official documents also changed, from [[Old English]] to Latin. The forest laws were introduced, leading to the setting aside of large sections of England as [[royal forest]].<ref name=Thomas60/> The Domesday survey was an administrative catalogue of the landholdings of the kingdom, and was unique to medieval Europe. It was divided into sections based on the shires, and listed all the landholdings of each [[tenant-in-chief]] of the king as well as who had held the land before the conquest.<ref name=Conquest200>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 200<U+2013>201</ref>

===Language===
One of the most obvious effects of the conquest was the introduction of [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], a northern dialect of [[Old French]], as the language of the ruling classes in England, displacing Old English. French words entered the English language, and a further sign of the shift was the usage of names common in France instead of [[Germanic name|Anglo-Saxon names]]. Male names such as [[William (name)|William]], [[Robert]] and [[Richard]] soon became common; female names changed more slowly. The Norman invasion had little impact on [[placenames]], which had changed significantly after earlier Scandinavian invasions. It is not known precisely how much English the Norman invaders learned, nor how much the knowledge of French spread among the lower classes, but the demands of trade and basic communication probably meant that at least some of the Normans and native English were bilingual.<ref name=Conquest323>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 323<U+2013>324</ref> Nevertheless it is known that [[William the Conqueror]] himself never developed a working knowledge of English and for centuries afterward English was not well understood by the nobility.<ref>Crystal ''The English Language: A Guided Tour of the Language'', section ''The story of Middle English''</ref>

===Immigration and intermarriage===
An estimated 8000 Normans and other continentals settled in England as a result of the conquest, although exact figures cannot be established. Some of these new residents intermarried with the native English, but the extent of this practice in the years immediately after Hastings is unclear. Several marriages are attested between Norman men and English women during the years before 1100, but such marriages were uncommon. Most Normans continued to contract marriages with other Normans or other continental families rather than with the English.<ref name=Huscroft321>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 321<U+2013>322</ref> Within a century of the invasion, intermarriage between the native English and the Norman immigrants had become common. By the early 1160s, [[Ailred of Rievaulx]] was writing that intermarriage was common in all levels of society.<ref name=Thomas107>Thomas ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 107<U+2013>109</ref>

===Society===
[[File:Anglo-Saxon village at West Stow 6337 Keith Evans.jpg|thumb|right|Modern-day reconstruction of an Anglo-Saxon village at [[West Stow Anglo-Saxon village|West Stow]]]] 
The impact of the conquest on the lower levels of English society is difficult to assess. The major change was the elimination of [[Slavery in the British Isles|slavery in England]], which had disappeared by the middle of the 12th century.<ref name=Huscroft327>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 327</ref> There were about 28,000 slaves listed in ''Domesday Book'' in 1086, fewer than had been enumerated for 1066. In some places, such as Essex, the decline in slaves was 20 per cent for the 20 years.<ref name=Clanchy93>Clanchy ''England and its Rulers'' p. 93</ref> The main reasons for the decline in slaveholding appear to have been the disapproval of the Church and the cost of supporting slaves, who unlike [[serf]]s, had to be maintained entirely by their owners.<ref name=Ruling94>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 94</ref> The practice of slavery was not outlawed, and the ''[[Leges Henrici Primi]]'' from the reign of King Henry I continue to mention slaveholding as legal.<ref name=Clanchy93/>

Many of the free peasants of Anglo-Saxon society appear to have lost status and become indistinguishable from the non-free serfs. Whether this change was due entirely to the conquest is unclear, but the invasion and its after-effects probably accelerated a process already under way. The spread of towns and increase in nucleated settlements in the countryside, rather than scattered farms, was probably accelerated by the coming of the Normans to England.<ref name=Huscroft327/> The lifestyle of the peasantry probably did not greatly change in the decades after 1066.<ref name=Huscroft329>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 329</ref> Although earlier historians argued that women became less free and lost rights with the conquest, current scholarship has mostly rejected this view. Little is known about women other than those in the landholding class, so no conclusions can be drawn about peasant women's status after 1066. Noblewomen appear to have continued to influence political life mainly through their kinship relationships. Both before and after 1066 aristocratic women could own land, and some women continued to have the ability to dispose of their property as they wished.<ref name=Huscroft281>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 281<U+2013>283</ref>

==Historiography==
Debate over the conquest started almost immediately. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', when discussing the death of William the Conqueror, denounced him and the conquest in verse, but the king's obituary notice from William of Poitiers, a Frenchman, was laudatory and full of praise. Historians since then have argued over the facts of the matter and how to interpret them, with little agreement.<ref name=Clanchy31/> The theory or myth of the "[[Norman Yoke]]" arose in the 17th century,<ref name=Debate6>Chibnall ''Debate'' p. 6</ref> the idea that Anglo-Saxon society had been freer and more equal than the society that emerged after the conquest.<ref name=Debate38>Chibnall ''Debate'' p. 38</ref> This theory owes more to the period it was developed in than to historical facts, but it continues to be used in both political and popular thought to the present day.<ref name=Huscroft318>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 318<U+2013>319</ref>

In the 20th and 21st centuries historians have focused less on the rightness or wrongness of the conquest itself, instead concentrating on the effects of the invasion. Some, such as [[Richard Southern]], have seen the conquest as a critical turning point in history.<ref name=Clanchy31>Clanchy ''England and its Rulers'' pp. 31<U+2013>35</ref> Southern stated that "no country in Europe, between the rise of the barbarian kingdoms and the 20th century, has undergone so radical a change in so short a time as England experienced after 1066."<ref name=QClanchy32>Quoted in Clanchy ''England and its Rulers'' p. 32</ref> Other historians, such as H. G. Richardson and G. O. Sayles, believe that the transformation was less radical.<ref name=Clanchy31/> In more general terms, one writer has called the conquest "the last echo of the national migrations that characterized the early Middle Ages".<ref name=Singmanxv>Singman ''Daily Life'' p. xv</ref> The debate over the impact of the conquest depends on what metrics are used to measure change after 1066. If [[Anglo-Saxon England]] was already evolving before the invasion, with the introduction of [[feudalism]], castles or other changes in society, then the conquest, while important, did not represent radical reform. But the change was dramatic if measured by the elimination of the English nobility or the loss of Old English as a literary language. Nationalistic arguments have been made on both sides of the debate, with the Normans cast as either the persecutors of the English or the rescuers of the country from a decadent Anglo-Saxon nobility.<ref name=Clanchy31/>
