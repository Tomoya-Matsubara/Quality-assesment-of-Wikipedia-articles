==Career==
Bollettieri was the tennis director at Dorado Beach Hotel in [[Puerto Rico]] in the early-mid-1970s when it was a [[Rockefeller]] resort. His main assistant coach there was Julio Moros, who followed Nick when he set up his academy in Florida.

NBTA was the first major tennis boarding school and it changed the way tennis was taught at the elite junior level.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

Seeing a template for other sports, International Management Group ([[IMG (company)|IMG]]) bought the academy from Bollettieri in 1987, but Bollettieri continues to manage and play a pivotal role in the development of the tennis academy and ancillary programs.<ref name="IMG Academy">{{cite web|title=IMG Academy Bollettieri Tennis Program|url=http://www.imgacademy.com/sports/tennis|accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>
