'''St Margaret's Church''' (dedicated in full to '''St Margaret of Antioch''') is an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] church in the village of [[West Hoathly]] in [[Mid Sussex]], one of seven [[Districts of England|local government districts]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[West Sussex]].  By the late 11th century, a simple single-room stone building existed on the high, open ridge upon which the village developed.  A series of medieval expansions doubled its size by the 15th century, and the present building has changed little since then<U+2014>despite a [[Victorian restoration]] overseen by architect [[Richard Carpenter (architect)|R.H. Carpenter]].  A major addition was the heavily [[buttress]]ed [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular Gothic]] west tower, topped with a tall [[broach spire]] and containing a peal of ancient bells.  The large, steeply terraced churchyard also serves as a public cemetery and has far-reaching views across the [[Weald]].  The original dedication to [[Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret of Antioch]] fell out of use for many centuries until a researcher rediscovered it.  The church serves a large rural parish which was reduced in size in 1882 when two residents of the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of Highbrook paid for an additional church to be built there.  [[English Heritage]] has [[Listed building|listed]] it at Grade I for its architectural and historical importance.

==History==
West Hoathly stands on a high ridge in the [[Weald]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-southwest of the ancient market town of [[East Grinstead]].  [[Worth, West Sussex|Worth]], now part of the [[Crawley]] urban area but originally a large parish with a [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] [[St Nicholas' Church, Worth|church]], lies a similar distance to the northwest.<ref name="Fisher212">{{Harvnb|Fisher|1970|p=212.}}</ref>  The land rises to {{convert|600|ft|m}} just outside the village, and outcrops of [[sandstone]] (such as the mushroom-shaped "Great-on-Little")<ref name="Hidden147">{{Harvnb|Swinfen|Arscott|1984|p=147.}}</ref> are nearby.<ref name="VCH56941">{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56941|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 7 <U+2013> The Rape of Lewes.

The [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]] of 1086 did not mention a church or settlement at West Hoathly,<ref name="Fisher212"/> but architectural evidence suggests that the core the present church dates from about 1090,<ref name="VCH56941"/> when it would have been merely "a little [[Norman architecture|Norman]] building".<ref name="SACv35p202">{{Harvnb|Hannah|1935|p=202.}}</ref>  At that time it would have been a simple single-cell structure consisting of a [[nave]] and [[chancel]] and "possibly ... an [[apse]]".<ref name="Coppin127">{{Harvnb|Coppin|2006|p=127.}}</ref>  It was situated overlooking the surrounding forests on the ridge which forms the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] between rivers flowing north towards the [[River Thames|Thames]] and south towards the [[English Channel]].  Along with the church at [[Rotherfield]], it was<U+2014>and remains<U+2014>the only ancient church in the whole of the Weald to stand right on the crest of this ridge.<ref name="SACv35pp201<U+2013>202">{{Harvnb|Hannah|1935|pp=201<U+2013>202.}}</ref>

[[File:St Margaret's Church, West Hoathly (Viewed across Fields from Southeast).JPG|thumb|left|The tall [[broach spire]], seen here from the fields southeast of the village, was added in the early 15th century.]]
[[File:St Margaret's Church, West Hoathly (from Southwest).JPG|thumb|left|The vestry ''(centre foreground)'' and porch were 19th-century additions.]]
Within a century, the church underwent the first of several major structural alterations which have resulted in "seven different medieval styles [and] building periods" being represented.<ref name="SACv35p202"/>  Around the end of the 12th century, the nave was extended by the addition of a south aisle, for which the south wall of the nave was removed.  A "typical Norman arcade" was inserted in its place.<ref name="Coppin127"/><ref name="SACv35p203">{{Harvnb|Hannah|1935|p=203.}}</ref>  Next, in about 1200, the west end of the chancel was altered and the chancel arch leading to the nave was removed without replacement.<ref name="SACv35p203"/><ref name="Fisher213">{{Harvnb|Fisher|1970|p=213.}}</ref>  More significant and "far more interesting"<ref name="SACv35p203"/> work was then undertaken on the chancel in the third quarter of the 13th century: it was extended to the east, making it longer than the nave<U+2014>a very rare pattern, whose only equivalent in a Sussex parish church is [[St Laurence's Church, Guestling|St Laurence's Church]] at [[Guestling]] according to one authority.<ref name="Fisher213"/>  A pair of windows, one a [[Lancet window|lancet]] and the other a plain two-light opening set below a [[quatrefoil]], were inserted in the north wall, around 1250; they are "a most remarkable example of the beginnings of [[tracery]]".<ref name="SACv35p203"/>  The fifth stage of development consisted of the construction of a [[Lady chapel]] on the south side in about 1270.<ref name="SACv35p204">{{Harvnb|Hannah|1935|p=204.}}</ref>  A two-[[Bay (architecture)|bay]] arcade supported on octagonal [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] separated this from the chancel.<ref name="Pevsner627">{{Harvnb|Nairn|Pevsner|1965|p=627.}}</ref>  Early in the 14th century, a sixth stage of rebuilding took place: this was a major redevelopment, possibly caused by fire or other structural damage.<ref name="SACv35p206">{{Harvnb|Hannah|1935|p=206.}}</ref>  The narrow south aisle was rebuilt in the [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Decorated Gothic]] style<ref name="Pevsner626">{{Harvnb|Nairn|Pevsner|1965|p=626.}}</ref> to make it wider than the adjacent Lady chapel<ref name="VCH56941"/> (this lasted longer than the rest of the contemporary work);<ref name="SACv35p206"/> an arch was inserted to link the chapel and aisle;<ref name="Coppin127"/> diagonal [[buttress]]es were added to support the east wall of the chancel;<ref name="SACv35p205">{{Harvnb|Hannah|1935|p=205.}}</ref> two "rather coarsely executed" windows were inserted in the rebuilt south wall; and a new south entrance, a holy water [[Holy water font|stoup]] and a [[piscina]] were inserted.<ref name="SACv35p206"/>  At the start of the 15th century, a [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular Gothic]] tower with "the usual [[Roof shingle|shingled]] [[broach spire]]"<ref name="Pevsner626"/> was built at the west end.<ref name="SACv35p206"/><ref name="Black543">{{Harvnb|Black|Black|1861|p=543.}}</ref>  It obscured the nave's original west window, so a new window was inserted in the north wall instead.<ref name="VCH56941"/>  The church, originally a small and simple building, had "doubled its size in 250 years" as a result of these alterations: "the perfect example of a church steadily expanding ... to fulfil its local requirements".<ref name="Coppin127"/>

[[File:Stained glass window in St. Margaret's Church - geograph.org.uk - 1320418 (Cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Some windows, such as this [[quatrefoil]], have [[stained glass]].]]
A new south door was added in 1626: [[wrought iron]] nails in the woodwork spell out the date {{smallcaps|march 31 1626}}.<ref name="Coppin127"/><ref name="Whiteman174">{{Harvnb|Whiteman|Whiteman|1998|p=174.}}</ref><ref name="SACv35p209">{{Harvnb|Hannah|1935|p=209.}}</ref>  Earlier, during the [[Jacobean era]], a [[pulpit]] with scrollwork-decorated panelling was installed.<ref name="SACv35p209"/>  A wooden gallery was built at the west end in 1723.  Re-shingling of the spire was carried out in 1731 (by craftsmen from [[Rotherfield]], well-known locally for its shingling industry), 1734 and 1741, when part of the south wall of the chancel was also shingled to make it damp-proof.<ref name="SACv35p210">{{Harvnb|Hannah|1935|p=210.}}</ref>

The church was [[Victorian restoration|restored]] in 1870 by [[William Slater (architect)|William Slater]] and [[Richard Carpenter (architect)|Richard Herbert Carpenter]].  They removed many 17th-century features, added a porch and [[vestry]] (described in 1935 as "perfectly deplorable examples"),<ref name="SACv35p209"/> tiled the floor<ref name="SACv35p211">{{Harvnb|Hannah|1935|p=211.}}</ref> and re-roofed the nave and chancel.<ref name="Pevsner627"/>  Slater and Carpenter's work, directed by the latter,<ref name="SACv35p209"/> has been called "unnecessarily costly",<ref name="SACv35p208">{{Harvnb|Hannah|1935|p=208.}}</ref> but their work on the chancel work was praised as "enterprising" by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]].<ref name="Pevsner627"/>  Further work took place in 1935, undertaken by W.H. Shelford.<ref name="SNQv6(i)p23">{{Harvnb|Hannah|1936|p=23.}}</ref>  The glazed tiles and wood flooring were removed, revealing old tombs including one dating from 1624 near the [[altar rails]], and the floor was relaid in stone.<ref name="SACv35p211"/><ref name="SNQv6(i)p23"/>  The altar, which had been placed on a step, was lowered to its original height again.  A new set of altar rails were also installed, and were positioned to run straight across the chancel; they were not newly constructed, but dated from the late 17th century and apparently came from [[St Mary's Church, Barcombe]].  They were bought it an antique shop in [[The Lanes]] in [[Brighton]].<ref name="SNQv6(i)p23"/>

In 1935, the church's dedication to [[Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret of Antioch]]<U+2014>rare in England<U+2014>was rediscovered, having been lost for centuries.  A member of the [[Sussex Archaeological Society]] found a 13th-century document with details of the dedication while undertaking research.<ref name="Coppin127"/><ref name="SACv35p201">{{Harvnb|Hannah|1935|p=201.}}</ref>

==Architecture==
[[File:St Margaret's Church, West Hoathly (Southeast Corner).JPG|thumb|right|The church is built of sandstone rubble.]]
Descriptions of St Margaret's Church include "large and interesting",<ref name="Black543"/> "the main point of interest ... [in] a village full of charm and beauty",<ref name="Wales229"/> and "a rather typical wealden church ... seeming from every side to form an integral part of the landscape".<ref name="SACv35p201"/>  In this respect it is similar to many ancient churches in the area, established by [[Norman conquest of England|Norman]] settlers in forest clearings in the Weald<U+2014>then a remote area with little access.<ref name="SACv35p201"/><ref name="P<U+00E9>104">{{Harvnb|P<U+00E9>|2006|p=104.}}</ref>  It is built of [[sandstone]] rubble quarried from the local area, and has a chancel, nave, [[Lady chapel]] and adjacent aisle on the south side, tower with an octagonal spire, [[vestry]] in the southwest corner and an entrance porch.<ref name="VCH56941"/>  The stone is laid in wide [[Course (architecture)|courses]].  Some of the [[Quoin (architecture)|quoins]] have stone dressings,<ref name="Fisher212"/> and [[Horsham Stone]] slabs and tiles cover the roof.<ref name="VCH56941"/>  Although this layout is straightforward and common, the parts are not perfectly aligned and the nave is slightly wider than the chancel on both sides.<ref name="SACv35p202"/>  The dimensions of the nave are {{convert|32+1/2|x|18+1/2|ft|m}}; of the chancel, {{convert|37|x|18+1/2|ft|m}}; of the Lady chapel, {{convert|25|x|15+1/2|ft|m}}; of the aisle, {{convert|32+1/2|x|16|ft|m}}; and of the tower, {{convert|12|sqft|sqm}}.<ref name="VCH56941"/>  The tower is apparently lower than intended: it extends just {{convert|3|ft|m}} above the tops of the corner [[buttress]]es.<ref name="SACv35p206"/>  Above it, the "comparatively tall" octagonal [[broach spire]] is topped by a copper [[weather vane]].<ref name="VCH56941"/>

The oldest fabric dates from the early Norman era: the west and north walls of the nave, built in about 1090, survive.<ref name="Fisher212"/>  The north wall of the chancel may also be original.<ref name="VCH56941"/>  The extension of the chancel in the 13th century approximately doubled its length; it was originally square.<ref name="VCH56941"/><ref name="SACv35p203"/>  The arcades leading to the Lady chapel and the aisle are both of two [[Bay (architecture)|bays]]; they have conventional Norman octagonal [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] and "fat short round piers" respectively.<ref name="Coppin127"/><ref name="VCH56941"/><ref name="Pevsner627"/>  The arches of the aisle arcade have double [[chamfer]]s.<ref name="Pevsner627"/>  The south aisle was widened in the [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Decorated Gothic]] style in about 1330.<ref name="VCH56941"/><ref name="Pevsner626"/>  A round-arched doorway dating from the 12th century was moved to the Lady chapel, and the [[Course (architecture)#String course|string course]] on the outer wall may also have been moved there from the original south wall of the chancel, which was removed to make way for the chapel.<ref name="VCH56941"/><ref name="SACv35p204"/>  The chancel arch was taken out in the 13th century<ref name="SACv35p203"/><ref name="Fisher213"/> (although the ''[[Victoria County History|Victoria County History of Sussex]]'' gives 15th century, coinciding with the installation of a [[rood]]).<ref name="VCH56941"/>

There are windows of various dates, and others were removed during the frequent extensions and alterations.  The east window of the chancel was altered during the 17th and 20th centuries, but has 13th-century origins in the form of [[chamfer]]ed vertical sections with [[Molding (decorative)|moulded]] splays.   There are three lights set into a pointed-arched recess.  A similar window is set in the east wall of the Lady chapel.  Most of the other windows in the chancel are 13th- and 14th-century [[Lancet window|lancets]], including one that is now blocked.  Some are [[trefoil]]- or [[quatrefoil]]-headed.<ref name="VCH56941"/>  The Lady chapel is lit by a pairt of two-light windows with trefoil heads and a quatrefoil above, both with plate [[tracery]].  There is also one smaller lancet window.  One original 11th-century opening survives in the nave wall, but it is now blocked.  The other windows are 15th-century, arched and [[Hood mould|hood-moulded]].  Two [[ogee]]-headed windows dating from about 1330, and representing "a further advance in design" on the slightly earlier windows of the Lady chapel, are in the wall of the south aisle.<ref name="VCH56941"/>

The "heavy, low" two-stage tower, again built of sandstone rubble, is supported by four-stage diagonal [[buttress]]es.  It is topped with [[ashlar]]; the shingled [[broach spire]] sits on this.  There are some small 15th- and 16th-century windows of various styles.  A [[Centring|two-centred]] arch with [[chamfer]]ed columns and mouldings gives access from the nave.<ref name="VCH56941"/>

Inside, there is a 12th-century font of [[Sussex Marble]].  It was repaired in the 19th century using the similar [[Purbeck Marble]], as the supply of local material from the quarries at [[Petworth]] was exhausted.<ref name="VCH56941"/><ref name="SACv35p203"/>  The south aisle has an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Chest (furniture)|chest]] believed to be about 800 years old;<ref name="Coppin127"/> another, dating from the 16th or 17th century but with a renewed lid, stands in the [[vestry]].  Also in the vestry are three early 17th-century [[cast iron]] grave tablets commemorating members of the locally important Infeld family of [[Gravetye Manor]].<ref name="VCH56941"/>  On the earlier two, dated 1612 and 1624, text is engraved directly on the ironwork.  The other, dated 1635, has a much rarer feature: a brass plate attached to the slab.<ref name="SACv35p210"/>  Medieval wall-paintings and [[mural]]s were once a common feature in Sussex churches, but many have been lost.  Figurative scenes predominated, but representations of foliage were sometimes painted in awkward locations such as sloping walls.  Few of these decorative images survive, but at St Margaret's Church some painted vines are visible in one of the window splays.<ref name="Vigar87">{{Harvnb|Vigar|1986|p=87.}}</ref><ref name="BMR90">{{Harvnb|Beevers|Marks|Roles|1989|p=90.}}</ref>  The "very delicate painting" is on the inside of one of the windows in the chancel's south wall, which was inserted in the mid-13th century.<ref name="SACv35p203"/>  The present west gallery was erected in 1899 as a replacement for the original, installed in 1723 but removed during Slater and Carpenter's renovations of 1870.<ref name="SACv35p210"/>

==Churchyard==
[[File:St Margaret's Church, West Hoathly (View from Churchyard 2).JPG|thumb|right|The churchyard is terraced in six stages, and gives "extraordinarily beautiful"<ref name="SACv35p211"/> southward views.]]
[[File:St Margaret's Church, West Hoathly (View from Churchyard 3).JPG|thumb|right|Historically, the walls were maintained by the landowners of the parish.]]
St Margaret's Church has an extensive terraced churchyard with far-reaching southward views across the Weald to the [[South Downs]].  Set across six levels, it is heavily planted with trees and flowers<U+2014>more than 100 species have been documented<U+2014>and has several seats and a signposted viewing area.<ref name="Wales229"/><ref name="Whiteman174"/><ref name="P<U+00E9>106"/><ref name="Hidden147"/><ref name="SMC-Churchyard">{{cite web|url=http://www.westhoathly.org.uk/Churchyard/Churchyard.html|title=St. Margaret<U+2019>s Church: Churchyard|year=2010|publisher=West Hoathly Parish Church|accessdate=26 February 2012}}</ref>  It has been extended several times.  One extension, described in 1935 as "recent", brought an artificial cave, possibly of medieval origin, into its boundaries.  It is hewn out of the rock near the floor of the valley above which the churchyard sits.<ref name="SACv35p211"/>

An ancient Sussex custom, also encountered at a few other churches nearby (such as those at [[All Saints Church, Lindfield|Lindfield]] and [[St Peter's Church, Ardingly|Ardingly]]), applied for many years at West Hoathly: every landowner in the parish was responsible for the upkeep of a specific section of the churchyard wall.  Each person was listed and the piece of wall they had to maintain was marked.  A list dated 1752 survives, showing 60 landowners' names.  Some parts of the wall still have initials and dates inscribed upon them.<ref name="SACv35p201"/><ref name="SNQv7(iv)p125">{{Harvnb|Hooper|1938|p=125.}}</ref>

As well as serving the church, the churchyard is licensed as a public burial ground.  The [[Diocese of Chichester]] does not directly manage it: instead it is looked after by the Parochial Church Council, who (along with the Friends of the Churchyard Trust, an independent body) pay for maintenance and improvements.  The [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] awarded the church a grant in 1996 to restore many of the ancient tombs.<ref name="SMC-Churchyard"/>

==Bells==
The church has a peal of five ancient bells.  They bear inscriptions as follows (bell 1 is the tenor bell):<ref name="SACv35p210">{{Harvnb|Hannah|1935|p=210.}}</ref>

The [[advowson]] (the right to appoint clergy) was first recorded the last decade of the 11th century, when it was held by Ralph de Cheyney of [[Lewes Priory|St Pancras Priory]] at [[Lewes]] on behalf of [[William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey]].  The [[Bishop of Chichester]] was authorised to hold the advowson from 1346, but in the late 14th century (in 1391 according to one source)<ref name="SACv35p207">{{Harvnb|Hannah|1935|p=207.}}</ref> the church was [[Appropriation (law)#Ecclesiastical law|appropriated]] again by Lewes Priory.  This relationship ceased after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1538; the advowson then passed in turn to [[Thomas Cromwell]], [[Anne of Cleves]] and then [[The Crown]].<ref name="VCH56941"/>
