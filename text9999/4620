==Plot==
"Invasion" opens to several new [[residency (medicine)|surgical residents]] from Mercy West entering Seattle Grace, a repercussion of the merger. [[Dr. Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]) is recovering from her [[liver transplantation]] surgery, after donating a portion of it to her father. In the residents' lounge, [[Dr. Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]) tries to explain to Mercy West resident Dr. Reed Adamson (Nora Zehetner) that she should not use a certain locker, due to it formerly belonging to the deceased [[Dr. George O'Malley]] ([[T.R. Knight]]). Adamson ignores her wishes, and uses the locker, leading Stevens to threatening her with a fight. Shortly thereafter, [[Dr. Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]]) and [[Dr. Lexie Grey]] ([[Chyler Leigh]]) are working in the emergency room, when [[Dr. Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]) embarrasses Yang by taking Mercy West resident [[Jackson Avery|Dr. Jackson Avery]] ([[Jesse Williams (actor)|Jesse Williams]])' side in a disagreement. Despite her mindset that all Mercy West residents would act in the manner of Adamson, Stevens develops a friendship with Dr. Charles Percy ([[Robert Baker (actor)|Robert Baker]]). After months of the two not speaking, [[Dr. Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ramirez]])'s father, Carlos ([[Hector Elizondo]]), shows up to the hospital with a priest, trying to condemn Torres for her concurrence in [[homosexuality]]. Under the supervision of [[Dr. Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), Lexie works with Mercy West resident [[April Kepner|Dr. April Kepner]] ([[Sarah Drew]]) on a burglar, and the two get in several disagreements, leading Lexie to steal her diary. 

[[Dr. Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]) and Adamson continuously argue over the course of treatment for a patient, leading the patient's daughter to yell at them in disbelief. Angry about the revelation that Percy was using her, Stevens accidentally administers the wrong [[dialysis]] to a patient, making her an unviable candidate for the [[kidney transplant]] she was scheduled to receive. After arguing over surgical cases for the entirety of the day, Yang comes to the realization that she needs a [[cardiothoracic surgeon]] to work at the hospital. After being mistreated by Kepner, Lexie begins to mock her about what is written in her diary, but subsequently apologizes. [[Arizona Robbins|Dr. Arizona Robbins]] ([[Jessica Capshaw]]), Torres' girlfriend, talks to Carlos, and convinces him to accept his daughter's sexuality. Having found out about Stevens' mistake, [[Dr. Miranda Bailey]] ([[Chandra Wilson]]) reprimands her reports her to the chief of surgery [[Dr. Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens, Jr.]]). Webber asks Stevens to come into her office, and he fires her from the staff, noting that Hunt, Shepherd, and Karev had concerns with her coming back to work so early. Stevens departs, writing Karev a [[Dear John letter]], and he cries to Meredith and Yang.

Wilding commented that Stevens was originally seeking friendship with Percy, because he reminded her of O'Malley.<ref name="matter"/> At the conclusion of the episode, Torres ultimately reunites with her father Carlos. Wilding offered his insight on this and the overall episode: {{quote|"Shonda came up with the idea of Mr. Torres showing up with the family priest. I immediately said YES because anytime I can see Hector Elizondo on my TV screen, I'm all for it. In the scene where he's quoting the Bible at Callie, he really is afraid he's going to lose her. He's desperate, yanking out those index cards like her very life depends on it. It was Hector's idea to use the cards. He didn't think his character would know that stuff of the top of his head, which is how I originally wrote it. And he was right. And it worked beautifully. And that final scene when he and Callie are outside the hospital and he's asking her if she'll still get married, still have kids<U+2026> I really, really liked that scene. And I really, really liked their whole story. All told, I thought the episode came out pretty well."|Mark Wilding|''Grey Matter''<ref name="matter"/>}}
