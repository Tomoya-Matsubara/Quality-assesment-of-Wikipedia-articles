'''Hurricane Doreen''' was considered the worst [[tropical cyclone]] to affect [[California]] in 32 years. The tenth tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, and second hurricane of the very inactive [[1977 Pacific hurricane season]], Doreen developed from a tropical disturbance offshore of Mexico. After forming, the depression tracked northwestward, and intensified into Tropical Storm Doreen later that day. Further strengthening occurred in the following days, and Doreen had reached hurricane status early on August 15. Doreen then re-curved to the north-northwest and began approaching [[Baja California]]. As Doreen again re-curved to the northwest on August 15, it made two landfalls on the west coast of Baja California, the first time as a hurricane on August 15, and the second one as a tropical storm on August 16. Re-merging into the [[Pacific Ocean]], Doreen paralleled the Baja California Peninsula and eventually weakened to a tropical depression on August 17. Early on the following day, the storm dissipated near the southwest coast of California.

Hurricane Doreen and its remnants caused severe flooding in northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States. In Mexico, heavy rainfall was reported on both Baja California and the mainland of Mexico. Flooding left 2,000 people homeless in [[Mexicali]] along the United States-Mexico border, in addition, 325 homes and businesses were destroyed in southern California. Several highways were also flooded during the passage of the storm, most notably, lanes on [[Interstate 8]] and [[Interstate 15]] were washed out. In [[San Diego County, California|San Diego]] and [[Imperial County, California|Imperial County]], the total damage to agricultural interests was $25 million (1977 [[United States dollar|USD]]). In addition, eight fatalities were reported in California. Elsewhere, impact from Doreen or its remnants was relatively light.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Doreen 1977 track.png}}
The origins of Hurricane Doreen were from a tropical disturbance which formed {{convert|115|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Acapulco]], Mexico, on August 11. Over the next two days, the system drifted westward at {{convert|7|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. By 0000 UTC August 13, the [[Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center]] began classifying the system as Tropical Depression Ten, which was centered {{convert|460|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Acapulco, Mexico. Immediately after developing, the depression curved northwestward, and began slowly intensifying over [[sea surface temperatures]] (SST's) of {{convert|82|F|C|abbr=on}}. By 1800 UTC, winds increased to 50 mph (85 km/h), and the depression was then upgraded to Tropical Storm Doreen, which was centered about {{convert|530|mi|km|abbr=on}} west-northwest of Acapulco, Mexico. Air Force reconnaissance began investigating Doreen late on August 14, and located the center about {{convert|185|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of the tip of Baja California. Another flight into the storm shortly thereafter confirmed that Doreen had intensified into a hurricane at 1800 UTC.<ref name="mwr"/>

At the time, the eye of Doreen was around {{convert|17|mi|km|abbr=on}} in diameter. After becoming a hurricane, Doreen re-curved to the north-northwest as it sped up slightly to {{convert|10|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Doreen approached Baja California, as it maintained minimal hurricane status. By August 18 at 1800 UTC, Doreen was centered only {{convert|17|mi|km|abbr=on}} when it curved northwestward. Late on August 18, the storm made landfall on the western coast of Baja California as a minimal hurricane. Shortly thereafter, Doreen re-emerged into the Pacific Ocean, over SST's of less than {{convert|72|F|C|abbr=on}}. As a result, Doreen weakened to a tropical storm before making another landfall on the Port Eugenia Peninsula on August 16 shortly after 0600 UTC. Once again, Doreen quickly re-emerged into the Pacific Ocean over the Bay of Sebastian Vizcaino. Due to SST's as low as {{convert|68|F|C|abbr=on}}, Doreen continued to weaken, and was downgraded to a tropical depression by early on August 17. After satellite imagery noted a poorly-defined low-level circulation, the final advisory was issued on Doreen , which was centered about {{convert|29|mi|km}} west of [[San Clemente Island]], California at 0000 UTC on August 18. The remnants of the storm tracked into the [[Southwestern United States]] and dissipated over the [[Colorado River]] Valley.<ref name="mwr"/>

[[File:Doreen1977filledrainblk.gif|thumb|right|Rainfall summary for Hurricane Doreen]]
Hurricane Doreen dropped heavy rainfall along the western portions of Mexico and the Southwestern Region of the United States. In Mexico, Doreen produced heaviest precipitation along the [[Baja California peninsula]], where rainfall peaked at {{convert|14.80|in|mm|abbr=on}} in the [[Los Cabos Municipality|Los Cabos Area]]. The mainland of Mexico also received heavy rainfall, especially in the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] mountains.<ref name="rainfall">{{cite web|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/doreen1977.html|title=Hurricane Doreen - August 12-18, 1977 |last=Roth|first=David|date=14 October 2008|publisher=[[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]]|accessdate=11 August 2011}}</ref> In the city of [[Mexicali]], the storm left more than 2,000 people homeless, many of which were [[Shanty town|shanty-style]] homes.<ref name="AP&UPI">{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HFwaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eSkEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6835%2C4273249|title=8 Killed as Storm Strikes California|author=[[Associated Press]] and [[United Press International]]|date=18 August 1977|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|accessdate=11 August 2011}}</ref>  
===United States===
In anticipation of the storm, flash flood warnings were issued in the [[Colorado River]] Valley area, and were extended into southern California on August 16. Heavy rainfall fell in southern California on August 16. An average of {{convert|2|-|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain fell over low-lying areas of southern California for a period of three days. Heavier precipitation was reported in the mountainous areas, where rainfall peaked at {{convert|7.45|in|mm|abbr=on}} on [[San Jacinto Peak]]. Several other locations also reported heavy rainfall; {{convert|2.47|in|mm|abbr=on}} was reported at the [[Los Angeles International Airport]], {{convert|3.78|in|mm|abbr=on}} in [[Calexico, California|Calexico]], and {{convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on}} at [[Mitchell Caverns]].<ref name="rainfall"/><ref name="mwr">{{cite web|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0493%281978%29106%3C0546%3AENPTCO%3E2.0.CO%3B2|title=Eastern North Pacific Tropical Cyclones of 1977|last=Gunther|first=Emil|date=April 1978|publisher=[[Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=11 August 2011}}</ref> At [[Edwards Air Force Base]], the launch of [[Space Shuttle Enterprise]] on August 31 was delayed to September 7 after rainfall from Doreen flooded the runway of the previous flight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8q1VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KeADAAAAIBAJ&pg=5604,7965095&dq=hurricane+doreen&hl=en|title=Shuttle flight planned Sept. 7|author=United Press International|date=31 August 1977|publisher=[[The Register-Guard|Eugene Register-Guard]]|accessdate=11 August 2011}}</ref> In addition to heavy rain, high winds were reported.

Further west, larger swaths of rainfall occurred in Nevada, though precipitation was generally light, with many areas experiencing less than {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}}. Rainfall in Nevada had peaked at {{convert|4.14|in|mm|abbr=on}} in Avaden,<ref name="rainfall"/> making Doreen the wettest tropical cyclone for the state of Nevada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/tcstatemaxima.gif|title=Maximum Rainfall caused by Tropical Cyclones and their remnants per state (1950-2011)|date=28 August 2011|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|accessdate=13 December 2011}}</ref> In [[Las Vegas]], major intersections were flooded due to precipitation amounts of about {{convert|1.5|in|mm|abbr=on}}. In addition to street flooding, some roofs collapses occurred to houses and buildings.<ref name="AP&UPI"/> 

In [[New Mexico]], lesser amounts of rainfall were reported, and precipitation was limited to the northeastern and southwestern portions of the state. Much it the rainfall was between {{convert|1|to|2|in|mm|abbr=on}},<ref name="rainfall"/> and precipitation with the state peaked at {{convert|2.05|in|mm|abbr=on}} in the city of Florida.<ref name="westrainfall"/> Rainfall was also minimal in the state of [[Utah]], with only a few isolated areas reporting light precipitation, and generally did not exceed {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}}.<ref name="rainfall"/> However, rainfall peaked at {{convert|4.31|in|mm|abbr=on}} in [[Logan, Utah|Logan]].<ref name="westrainfall"/> 

While surveying damage in southwestern Arizona, a request was made to then-Governor [[Raul Hector Castro]] for $750,000 (1977 USD) in emergency services funds. The [[American Red Cross]] had been in the area and spent $12,000 (1977 USD) to assist families that were left homeless after the flood.<ref name="KDM"/>
