==Plot and overview==
The student council members of Hekiyou Academy in [[Hokkaid<U+014D>]] are selected by a popularity contest. As a result the members are usually a group of [[bish<U+014D>jo|pretty girls]]. The sole male member is Ken Sugisaki, who entered the student council by becoming the top-scoring student in the level which he had to [[Cramming (education)|cram]] to achieve.

The series revolves around the meetings inside the student council room in {{nihongo|Private High School Hekiyou Academy|<U+79C1><U+7ACB><U+9AD8><U+6821><U+30FB><U+78A7><U+967D><U+5B66><U+5712>|Shiritsu K<U+014D>k<U+014D> Hekiy<U+014D> Gakuen}}. The story (as written in the series) has a [[metafiction]] component where, under the student council president Sakurano Kurimu orders, vice president Ken Sugisaki has to write stories to show the other students how brilliant the student council is. Ken negotiates with [[Fujimi Shobo]] to publish these stories. The author himself likens the series to that of a [[yonkoma]] novel<ref>Postscript from {{nihongo|Seitokai no Ichizon Hekiy<U+014D> Gakuen Seitokai Gijiroku 1|<U+751F><U+5F92><U+4F1A><U+306E><U+4E00><U+5B58> <U+78A7><U+967D><U+5B66><U+5712><U+751F><U+5F92><U+4F1A><U+8B70><U+4E8B><U+9332>1||lit.

===Hekiyou Academy Student Council===
;{{Nihongo|Ken Sugisaki|<U+6749><U+5D0E> <U+9375>|Sugisaki Ken}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Takashi Kond<U+014D>]]}}
:Ken is a 2nd Year student, and holds the Student Council "Blue Chip" Seat for Vice-President - Valedictorian. He entered the student council as the top-scoring student in his year; the highest scoring student has a choice to be in the student council. He had to work hard to improve his score, being in the lowest score bracket when he enrolled. He is referred to as "K<U+012B>-kun" by Chizuru, from his given name {{Nihongo|Ken|<U+9375>}} which also can be read as {{Nihongo|Kagi|<U+9375>||a key}}. Loves playing [[eroge]] and [[Bish<U+014D>jo game|galge]], and plans on making the rest of the student council members his harem. On the surface, he seems to be lazy and carefree, but he is actually very hardworking and always stays behind after dismissal to finish all the student council work so that the student council can have fun as always. Ken also has a serious side to him, and he truly cares for those around him; According to Kurimu, they have yet to find someone who dislikes Ken. Ken reveals to Lilicia that the student council itself is his "dream", where his goals and happiness co-exist.<br />A unique trivia about Ken is that he starts every episode with behavior that exasperates the other members of the student council, but at the end of each episode Ken always shows his serious side, making the other members of the student council grateful to him. Ken was bullied in the past by his classmates during middle school despite his apparent happiness and two-timed two girls, he even asked to be bullied in middle school. In contrast to his active self in the student council, Sugisaki Ken was often isolated socially in middle school. In the last episode, its revealed that he met all of the girls in the current student council throughout the year before joining, one in each season. Each of the four girls changed his life in some way for the better and help create the perverse and goofy, but kind and hard-working person that he is now. It's because of those encounters that he strived to be in the student council for the sole purpose of repaying them by making all four of the girls happy.

;{{Nihongo|Kurimu Sakurano|<U+685C><U+91CE> <U+304F><U+308A><U+3080>|Sakurano Kurimu}}
:{{Anime voice|[[Mariko Honda]]}}
:Kurimu is a senior in Hekiyou Academy, and is the president of the student council.<ref>''[[Dragon Magazine (Fujimi Shobo)|Dragon Magazine]]'' 2008 September issue, page 4.</ref> She has an extreme sweet tooth, and has a pink/reddish hair. Her nickname is {{Nihongo|Aka-chan|<U+30A2><U+30AB><U+3061><U+3083><U+3093>}}, which was given to her by Chizuru; She added an extra character to her first name, and changed it to {{Nihongo|Kurimuzon|<U+30AF><U+30EA><U+30E0><U+30BE><U+30F3>||Crimzon}} and translated to Japanese becomes {{Nihongo|Aka|<U+8D64>||Red}}. Her nickname can also mean {{Nihongo|Aka-chan|<U+8D64><U+3061><U+3083><U+3093>||a baby}}. This is often used as a joke against her in the series, poking fun of her childish size and looks, despite being a senior. However, acting childish around Chizuru does not seem to bother her. She is well liked by most of the other students. Most of the episodes start out with Kurimu making a statement in front of a whiteboard. She is the cause of most of Ken's labor and why he became an [[eroge]] maniac.<ref>Postscript from {{nihongo|Seitokai no Ichizon Hekiy<U+014D> Gakuen Seitokai Gijiroku 1|<U+751F><U+5F92><U+4F1A><U+306E><U+4E00><U+5B58> <U+78A7><U+967D><U+5B66><U+5712><U+751F><U+5F92><U+4F1A><U+8B70><U+4E8B><U+9332>1||lit. ''The Student Council's Discretion - Hekiy<U+014D> Academy Student Council Minutes 1''}}, page 202 - 203</ref> Kurimu and Ken met in the spring (<U+685C><U+91CE> = field of cherry blossoms) when she was Vice President at the time, Ken decided to help her carry boxes. He asked for her help in becoming a better person, and Kurimu suggested playing a dating sim game as she said that the main character's job is to make everyone happy. Their meeting gave him a goal in mind and taught him to look towards the future. Like the season she represents, she's often the first to suggest something and is always looking towards the bigger picture in mind. She has a very large ego calling herself the best student council in the world, and that she is destined to be a god. She is very childish, but has a arrogant self image, thinking she has F-size breasts and is 170 cm tall and her clothes make her look small. She is also not very mature for her age. The anime suggests that she has feelings for Ken.

;{{Nihongo|Chizuru Akaba|<U+7D05><U+8449> <U+77E5><U+5F26>|Akaba Chizuru}}
:{{Anime voice|[[Yuka Sait<U+014D> (voice actress)|Yuka Sait<U+014D>]] (first season), [[Mina (voice actress)|Mina]] (second season)}}
:Chizuru is the Secretary of the Student Council. She has a tall and model-like figure. She is a mature woman who seems to spend most of her time being quite serious. However, she has a sadistic side to her, which is shown when she "brain-washes" Ken and Kurimu. Also, she makes a lot of references to her sadism in the anime. She loves to cuddle and "abuse" the President (Kurimu) in a little sister way, and is an avid reader. Sometimes, it is hinted towards her wanting to be [[Yuri (genre)|involved with]] Kurimu. She is hinted towards having a couple part-time jobs despite being too young legally to even have a job. While she is identified as the cool, serious type, she can embrace her more cutsy side to her once hopping around dressed as a cute sheep. Chizuru and Ken met in autumn (<U+7D05><U+8449> = red leaf) when Ken was suffering from a broken heart. Their meeting healed it and showed him compassion for others. Like the season she represents, she always seems a bit gloomy and hard to approach but has a certain elegance to her. In middle school, she was bullied by her best friend. As her friend was scared of losing Chizuru's friendship, she attempted to isolate Chizuru. The bullying created emotional scars that were later healed by the student council. Chizuru states she is not a morning person, with her hugging Kurimu in the morning. She is very manipulative, able to control Kurimu and Ken. She calls Ken her slave, and even set the ringtone to repeat "my slave" when he calls. In the anime she is hinted to have feelings for Ken. In the novel it appears her feelings grow to the point of being nervous around Ken.

;{{Nihongo|Minatsu Shiina|<U+690E><U+540D> <U+6DF1><U+590F>|Shiina Minatsu}}
:{{Anime voice|[[Misuzu Togashi]]}}
:Minatsu is a bold character and Student Council Vice-president. A tomboy with impressive athletic skills, and is surprisingly also good in math, which Ken considers to be uncharacteristic of her. She's popular among girls and has a bit of a [[Yuri (genre)|yuri]] taste. She's in the same class with Ken but she's an orthodox [[tsundere]] without any 'dere' (short for {{Nihongo|dere-dere|<U+3067><U+308C><U+3067><U+308C>}}) to be found. She also has a little sister, Mafuyu. She's very protective of Mafuyu and despises anyone who tries to hurt her. She's is into a lot of [[Sh<U+014D>nen manga]] as most of her suggestions tend to be based on typical Sh<U+014D>nen manga plots. Minatsu and Ken met in the summer (<U+6DF1><U+590F> = deep summer). Because of how she was, he looked up to her and to be like her, but she told him that he shouldn't aim to be like her but to aim for the impossible. Their meeting taught him not to be lazy and work if he desires something. Like the season she represents, she's fired up and is always ready to take action, especially when it has something to do with anime or manga. Both Minatsu and Mafuyu never got to know their father, and Minatsu was unwilling to meet her mothers' boyfriend saying it had nothing to do with them, creating a rift between Minatsu and her mother, but their mother always took care of them no matter how tired she was. In the anime she is suggested to have feelings for Ken. In the novel, her feelings for Ken grow so much that she is aware that she<U+00B4>s in love with him, even kissing Ken in volume 8 of the light novel.

;{{Nihongo|Mafuyu Shiina|<U+690E><U+540D> <U+771F><U+51AC>|Shiina Mafuyu}}
:{{Anime voice|Yuki Horinaka (first season), [[Iori Nomizu]] (second season)}}
:Mafuyu is the Student Council Treasurer. Minatsu's sister and the only freshman in the Council. She is a swaying [[bish<U+014D>jo]], and is afraid of males (though she lightens up to Ken). Ken thought her to be "the easiest character to see the ending" but later turns out to be the most feared one by some reason, even when compared to Chizuru, particularly the fact that she's a [[fujoshi]], and that she fantasizes pairing Ken romantically with a boy named Nakameguro (who turns out to be an actual person). When it comes to [[boys' love]]/ [[yaoi]], Mafuyu can actually be just as perverted, if not worse, than Ken. She's addicted to video games, and spends much of her free time playing with a [[handheld game console]] that resembles a pink [[PlayStation Portable]]. Despite her shy personality (or based on Ken's logic, because she's shy) she confesses her love to Ken, although she says she just wanted to share her feelings with him rather than start a relationship, because she loves the Student Council's atmosphere most of all, implying that even when she loves him she doesn't want to change how things are at the moment. Mafuyu and Ken met in the winter (<U+771F><U+51AC> = winter) chatting online with him as Yuki (with Ken as Key) and even having a more spirited personality online. Ken fell asleep once in the snow and, despite her fear of men, took him out of the freezing cold. Their meeting showed him a clear understanding about what strength really is. Like the season she represents, she's extremely passive and keeps a lot to herself, but she will show her real self and her real feelings if she feels comfortable.

;{{Nihongo|Hokuto Kagami|<U+706B><U+795E> <U+5317><U+6597>|Kagami Hokuto}}
:New Treasurer of the Student Council. Though her number of votes in the popularity poll was sixth place, she was awarded the election since Ringo Sugisaki and Rie Shiraki, the forth place and the fifth place, declined.

;{{Nihongo|Touko Hinomori|<U+65E5><U+5B88> <U+6771><U+5B50>|Hinomori T<U+014D>ko}}
:New Secretary of the Student Council. Since she always wears a mask, there are few students those who have ever seen the face of her before. But the students who noticed that she was extremely cute unanimously voted for her.

===Students===
;{{Nihongo|Lilicia Toudou|<U+85E4><U+5802> <U+30EA><U+30EA><U+30B7><U+30A2>|T<U+014D>d<U+014D> Ririshia}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Mamiko Noto]]}}
:Lilicia is the President of the Journalism Club, and ranked fifth in the school's popularity poll; just falling short of getting into the Student Council. Lilicia and Kurimu are constantly at loggerheads. Lilicia also seems to be extremely afraid of Chizuru. She claims that she despises the current Student Council because they always laze around, doing nothing. She constantly targets Ken for her attacks toward the Student Council for being a two-timing individual, though her sister Elise states that its because she likes him. Despite her repeated attempts to slander the Student Council, she has a mutual respect for them.

:{{Voiced by|[[Ry<U+014D>ko Shintani]]}}
:Ken and Minatsu's classmate. She is cute but failed to garner votes in the popularity poll due to defects in her character. Subsequently, she became an idol to show them what she could do.  She made a film with Ken starring in it, to which the audio from the film was misunderstood by the girls of the student council about Ken's identity.

:{{Voiced by|Y<U+016B>dai Sat<U+014D>}}
:Meguru's younger brother. He has a crush on Minatsu but she does not notice his feelings.
:Meguru and Mamoru are called "{{Nihongo|Space Siblings|<U+30B9><U+30DA><U+30FC><U+30B9><U+59C9><U+5F1F>|Sup<U+0113>su Ky<U+014D>dai}}" by classmates from their surname.

:{{Anime voice|[[Kazutomi Yamamoto]]}}
