Their products include stationery, school supplies, gifts and accessories that are sold worldwide and at specialty brand retail stores in Japan. Sanrio's best known character is [[Hello Kitty]], a white cat with red bow and no visible mouth, one of the most successful marketing brands in the world.<ref>Michael Kanellos, [http://news.cnet.com/Hello-Kittys-guide-to-business-success/2100-1041_3-5756324.html Hello Kitty's guide to business success]</ref>

Besides selling character goods, Sanrio takes part in movie production and publishing. They own the rights to the [[Peanuts]] characters in Japan.

==History==
[[Image:Stand Noguera Kitty Madrid.jpg|thumb|250px|Sanrio products stand at a commercial convention]]
'''Sanrio''' was founded by [[Shintaro Tsuji]] as the Yamanashi Silk Company in 1960, using 1 million yen in capital. In 1962, Tsuji expanded his enterprise from silk to rubber sandals with flowers painted on them.<ref name="Belson">Belson, K. (2003). Asia times online. The cat who turned kawaii into cash. Retrieved May 19, 2011, from http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/EL13Dh01.html</ref> Tsuji noted the profits gained by simply adding a cute design to the sandals and hired cartoonists to design cute characters for his merchandise in response.<ref name="Belson" /> In 1973 the company was officially established under the name "Sanrio". The company's European website says the name comes from the Spanish words ''san'' (holy) and ''r<U+00ED>o'' (river.)<ref name="Europe" /> The book {{nihongo|''korega Sanrio no himitsu desu''|<U+3053><U+308C><U+304C><U+30B5><U+30F3><U+30EA><U+30AA><U+306E><U+79D8><U+5BC6><U+3067><U+3059>}} or ''This is the Sanrio Company Secret'' gives another origin of the name.<ref name="<U+3053><U+308C><U+304C><U+30B5><U+30F3><U+30EA><U+30AA><U+306E><U+79D8><U+5BC6><U+3067><U+3059>" /> According to this book, Tsuji, Sanrio's founder, said that {{nihongo|Yamanashi|<U+5C71><U+68A8>}}, part of the company's former name, has an alternative [[on'yomi]] reading of ''sanri''.  The remaining ''o'' was added from the {{nihongo|ou|<U+30AA><U+30A6>}} sound people make when they are excited.<ref name="<U+3053><U+308C><U+304C><U+30B5><U+30F3><U+30EA><U+30AA><U+306E><U+79D8><U+5BC6><U+3067><U+3059>"><U+3053><U+308C><U+304C><U+30B5><U+30F3><U+30EA><U+30AA><U+306E><U+79D8><U+5BC6><U+3067><U+3059> (1979).</ref>

The company produced a line of character merchandise around gift-giving occasions.<ref name="Europe">{{cite web|url=http://www.sanrioeurope.com/about.asp|title=Sanrio Europe|accessdate=2009-09-14}}</ref> Hello Kitty was added to the lineup of early Sanrio characters in 1974 and the first related merchandise was released the following year. The popular mouthless feline has had both peaks and drops in sales over the years, but always has been the highest contributor to Sanrio's sales. Other notably popular characters through the years have been ''[[Little Twin Stars|The Little Twin Stars]]'' (created by Mr. Tsuji himself), ''[[List of Sanrio characters#My Melody|My Melody]]'', ''[[Keroppi]]'', ''[[List of Sanrio characters#Tuxedo Sam|Tuxedo Sam]]'', ''[[Badtz-Maru]]'', ''[[Chococat]]'', ''[[Cinnamoroll]]'', ''[[Sugarbunnies]]'', ''[[Jewelpet]]'' and ''[[Wish me mell]]''. Sanrio constantly adds new characters to its lineup. Specific characters are rotated in and out of active production.<ref>[http://www.sanrio.com/smallgift/more_characters/?chr=a-f Characters] - Sanrio.com</ref> For a short time, [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s baby unicorn character [[Unico]], who starred in two feature-length anime movies in the early 1980s, was also part of the Sanrio empire; however, the rights to Unico shifted to Osamu Tezuka's own company after Tezuka's death in 1989.

In late 2003, Sanrio won the "Top Brand with a Conscience" award from the [[Medinge Group]] of Sweden for its communication principles.<ref>[http://medinge.org/brands-with-a-conscience/past-winners/2004/ The Medinge Group - Brands with a Conscience Past winners 2004]</ref> The company has partnered with [[UNICEF]] since 1984. In 2006, Sanrio launched [[Sanrio Digital]] together with [[Typhoon Games]] to expand to the Internet, [[online game]]s and mobile services. 2010 was Sanrio's 50th anniversary. In conjuncture with this, [[Build-A-Bear Workshop]] released limited edition [[stuffed toy]]s of several Sanrio characters, including Hello Kitty, Chococat, My Melody and Keroppi.<ref>[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100804005380/en/Kitty-Sanrio-Friends-Celebrate-Sanrio%E2%80%99s-50th-Anniversary Hello Kitty and Sanrio Friends Celebrate Sanrio's 50th Anniversary at Build-A-Bear Workshop]</ref>

Hello Kitty is alleged to be drawn in a similar style to the rabbit [[Miffy]]. On August 26, 2010, Mercis BV, representing Miffy's creator [[Dick Bruna]], brought suit against Sanrio with the claim that one of Hello Kitty's companion characters, a rabbit named Cathy, infringes on the copyright and trademark of Miffy.<ref name=miffysuit>{{cite press release | url=http://www.sanrio.co.jp/rs/english/corporate/ir/detail/20101104.pdf | title=Announcement of Provisional Disposition Order Against Sanrio | publisher=Sanrio Company, Ltd. | date=November 4, 2010 | accessdate=July 25, 2011}}</ref> On November 2, 2010, a Dutch court ruled against Sanrio and ordered the company to stop marketing Cathy products in Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.<ref name=miffysuit /><ref>{{cite news | last=Kollewe | first=Julia | title=Miffy biffs Cathy in Kitty copycat case | newspaper=The Guardian | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/nov/04/cathy-infringes-miffy-copyright-case | accessdate=May 16, 2011 | location=London | date=November 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Dawson | first=Chester | coauthors=Kanna Takeuchi | title=Miffy, Hello Kitty Take Bunny Beef to Court | publisher=Wall Street Journal | url=http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2010/11/04/miffy-hello-kitty-take-bunny-beef-to-court/ | accessdate=May 16, 2011 | date=November 4, 2010}}</ref> Following the [[2011 T<U+014D>hoku earthquake and tsunami|March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami]] in Japan, Sanrio and Mercis reached an out-of-court settlement on June 7, 2011 for Sanrio to halt production worldwide of merchandise that feature Cathy.
