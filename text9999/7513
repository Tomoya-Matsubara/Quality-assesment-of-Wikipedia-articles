In October 1943, Haywood was assigned to the G-1 (Personnel) Division of the [[War Department General Staff]] in Washington, D.C. For his services in this role, he was promoted to [[colonel]] on 28 September 1944, and was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]]. On 5 August 1945, he became Assistant Chief of Staff (G-1) at headquarters, [[European Theater of Operations]] (ETO). For his services during the [[demobilization]], he was awarded a second Legion of Merit.<ref name="Cullum 1950"/>

==After the war==
[[File:Los Alamos colloquium.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Haywood (left) at a 1946 [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] colloquium on the [[Hydrogen bomb]]]]
Haywood was transferred to the headquarters of the [[Manhattan Project]] on 12 April 1946.<ref name="Cullum 1950"/> He was one of a number West Point graduates from the top ten percent of their classes who were transferred to the Manhattan Project at this time by the [[Secretary of War]], [[Robert P. Patterson]], at the request of the Manhattan Project's commander, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], and over the objection of senior Army leaders. Their job was to replace reservists who had worked for the Project during the war and now were eligible for separation from the Army.{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=373<U+2013>376}} Haywood participated in [[Operation Crossroads|Operation ''Crossroads'']], observing the [[nuclear test]]s at [[Bikini Atoll]].<ref name="MPVA">{{cite web |url=http://www.mphpa.org/classic/VET_ARCHIVES/MPVA_16.htm#haywood |publisher=Manhattan Project veterans archives |title=Haywood, Oliver G. |accessdate=27 July 2013}}</ref>

Groves hoped that a new, permanent agency would soon be created to take over the responsibilities of the wartime Manhattan Project, but passage of the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] through Congress took much longer than expected, and involved considerable debate about the proper role of the military with respect to the development, production and control of nuclear weapons.{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=389<U+2013>391}} The act that was finally signed by President [[Harry S. Truman]] on 1 August 1946 created a civilian agency, the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC), to take over the functions and assets of the Manhattan Project, but the AEC did not assume its role until 1 January 1947.{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=394<U+2013>395}} At this point, Haywood was seconded to the AEC's Directorate of Research.<ref name="Cullum 1950"/>

Although he had been a colonel in the Army of the United States, Haywood only held the substantive rank of captain in the Army Corps of Engineers. His Army of the United States rank was terminated on 30 June 1947, and he returned to duty with the War Department General Staff as a captain on 1 July 1947. Haywood elected to transfer to the newly created [[United States Air Force]] on 10 December 1947. He became a lieutenant colonel on 1 July 1948, and was assigned to the Air Plans Division on 29 August 1948,.<ref name="Cullum 1950"/> where he was involved in drawing up nuclear war plans.<ref name="MPVA"/> From July 1949 to May 1950 he attended the [[Air War College]] at [[Maxwell Air Force Base]], Alabama.<ref name="Cullum 1950"/>

Haywood was seconded to the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in New Mexico from February 1950 to October 1951, at a time when the first [[thermonuclear weapon]]s were being developed. [[Edward Teller]] once remarked that "Colonel Haywood is the only military man I would work for."<ref name="MPVA2">{{cite web |url=http://www.mphpa.org/classic/VET_ARCHIVES/More/16-04_haywood.htm |publisher=Manhattan Project veterans archives |title=Haywood, Oliver G. <U+2013> More Info |accessdate=27 July 2013}}</ref> Haywood then served at the chief of the Air Force Office of Scientific Research,<ref name="MPVA"/> and was vice commander of the [[Atlantic Missile Range]] until his retirement from active duty in 1953.
