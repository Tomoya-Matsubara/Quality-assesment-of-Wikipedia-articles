'''Cerebral circulation''' refers to the movement of [[blood]] through the network of [[blood vessel]]s supplying the [[brain]]. The [[artery|arteries]] deliver oxygenated blood, [[glucose]] and other nutrients to the brain and the [[vein]]s carry deoxygenated blood back to the [[heart]], removing [[carbon dioxide]], [[lactic acid]], and other metabolic products. Since the brain is very vulnerable to compromises in its blood supply, the cerebral circulatory system has many safeguards. Failure of these safeguards results in [[cerebrovascular accident]]s, commonly known as ''strokes''. The amount of blood that the cerebral circulation carries is known as [[cerebral blood flow]].

The following description is based on idealized human cerebral circulation. The pattern of circulation and its [[anatomical nomenclature|nomenclature]] vary between organisms. 

==Cerebral arteries==

There are four cerebral [[arteries]]. The largest are the two [[internal carotid artery|internal carotid arteries]], the left and right branches of the [[common carotid artery|common carotid arteries]] in the neck which enter the skull, as opposed to the [[external carotid artery|external carotid]] branches which supply the facial tissues. The two smaller arteries are the [[vertebral artery|vertebral arteries]], which branch from the [[subclavian artery|subclavian arteries]] which primarily supply the shoulders, lateral chest and arms.

Within the [[cranium]], which houses the brain, the two vertebral arteries fuse into the [[basilar artery]], which is located underneath, and primarily supplies, the brainstem.

Both [[internal carotid]] [[artery|arteries]], within and along the floor of the cerebral vault, are interconnected via the [[anterior communicating artery]]. Additionally, both [[internal carotid artery|internal carotid arteries]] are interconnected with the basilar artery via bilateral [[posterior communicating]] [[artery|arteries]].

The [[Circle of Willis]], long considered to be an important anatomic vascular formation, provides backup circulation to the brain. In case one of the supply arteries is occluded, the [[Circle of Willis]] provides interconnections between the [[internal carotid]] [[artery|arteries]] and [[basilar artery]] along the floor of the cerebral vault, providing blood to tissues that would otherwise become [[ischemic]].

==Cerebral venous drainage==

The venous drainage of the cerebrum can be separated into two subdivisions:  superficial and deep.  The superficial system is composed of [[dural venous sinuses]], which have wall composed of dura mater as opposed to a traditional vein.  The dural sinuses are, therefore located on the surface of the cerebrum.  The most prominent of these sinuses is the [[Superior sagittal sinus]] which flows in the sagittal plane under the midline of the cerebral vault, posteriorly and inferiorly to the [[torcula]], forming the [[Confluence of sinuses]], where the superficial drainage joins with the sinus the primarily drains the deep venous system.  From here, two [[transverse sinuses]] bifurcate and travel laterally and inferiorly in an S-shaped curve that form the [[sigmoid sinuses]] which go on to form the two [[jugular vein]]s. In the neck, the [[jugular vein]]s parallel the upward course of the [[carotid arteries]] and drain blood into the [[vena cava]].  The deep venous drainage is primarily composed of traditional veins inside the deep structures of the brain, which join behind the midbrain to form the [[Vein of Galen]].  This vein merges with the [[Inferior sagittal sinus]] to form the [[Straight sinus]] which then joins the superficial venous system mentioned above at the [[Confluence of sinuses]].
