The '''Cult of Dionysus''' is strongly associated with [[satyr]]s, [[centaur]]s, and [[sileni]], and its characteristic symbols are the [[Bull (mythology)|bull]], the [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], the [[ivy]], and the wine. The [[Dionysia]] and [[Lenaia]] festivals in [[Athens]] were dedicated to [[Dionysus]], as well as the [[Phallic processions]]. Initiates worshipped him in the [[Dionysian Mysteries]], which were comparable to and linked with the [[Orphic Mysteries]], and may have influenced [[Gnosticism]]. Orpheus was said to have invented the Mysteries of Dionysus.<ref name="Apollodorus1.3.2">Apollodorus ([[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo Apollodorus]]), [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Apollod.+1.3.2 ''Library and Epitome'', 1.3.2]. "Orpheus also invented the mysteries of Dionysus, and having been torn in pieces by the Maenads he is buried in Pieria." </ref>

The Cult of Dionysus traces back to at least [[Minoan Crete]], since his name is found on [[Mycenaean language|Mycenean]] [[Linear B]] tablets as "DI-WO-NI-SO-JO",<ref>Adams, John Paul. Professor of Classics, California State University, Northridge, 2005, ''Dionysos'' website. http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/dionysos.html</ref> and [[Karl Kerenyi]]<ref>Kerenyi 1976.</ref> Dionysus is often shown riding a [[leopard]], wearing a leopard skin, or in a chariot drawn by [[panther (legendary creature)|panthers]], and may also be recognized by the [[thyrsus]] he carries. Besides the [[grapevine]] and its wild barren alter-ego, the toxic ivy plant, both sacred to him, the [[fig]] was also his symbol. The [[pinecone]] that tipped his thyrsus linked him to [[Cybele]], and the [[pomegranate]] linked him to [[Demeter]]. 

==Bacchanalia==
{{main|Bacchanalia}}

Introduced into [[Rome]] (c. [[200 BC]]) from the [[Magna Graecia|Greek culture of southern Italy]] or by way of Greek-influenced [[Etruria]], the bacchanalia were held in secret and attended by women only, in the grove of Simila, near the [[Aventine Hill]], on [[March 16]] and [[March 17|17]]. Subsequently, admission to the rites were extended to men and celebrations took place five times a month. The notoriety of these festivals, where many kinds of crimes and political conspiracies were supposed to be planned, led in [[186 BC]] to a decree of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]<U+2014>the so-called ''Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus'', inscribed on a bronze tablet discovered in [[Calabria]] ([[1640]]), now at [[Vienna]]<U+2014>by which the Bacchanalia were prohibited throughout all Italy except in certain special cases which must be approved specifically by the Senate. In spite of the severe punishment inflicted on those found in violation of this decree, the Bacchanalia were not stamped out, at any rate in the south of Italy, for a very long time.

Dionysus is equated with both '''Bacchus''' and [[Liber]] (also ''Liber Pater'').  Liber ("the free one") was a god of fertility, wine, and growth, married to [[Libera (mythology)|Libera]].  His festival was the [[Liberalia (holiday)|Liberalia]], celebrated on [[March 17]], but in some myths the festival was also held on [[March 5]].

Dionysus sometimes has the [[epithet]] '''Acratophorus''', by which he was designated as the giver of unmixed wine, and worshipped at [[Phigaleia]] in [[Arcadia]].<ref>[[Pausanias]], viii. 39. <U+00A7> 4</ref><ref>{{Citation

Another epithet was '''Bromios''', "the thunderer" or "he of the loud shout". As '''Dendrites''', "he of the trees", he is a powerful fertility god.  '''[[Dithyrambos]]'''  is sometimes used to refer to him or to solemn songs sung to him at festivals; the name refers to his premature birth.  '''Eleutherios''' ("the liberator") was an epithet for both Dionysus and [[Eros (god)|Eros]].  Other forms of the god as that of fertility include the epithet in [[Samos Island|Samos]] and [[Lesbos]] '''[[Enorches]]''' ("with balls"<ref>Kerenyi 1976:286.</ref> or perhaps "in the testicles" in reference to Zeus' sewing the babe Dionysus into his thigh, i.e., his testicles).<ref>Jameson 1993, 53. Cf.n16 for suggestions of Devereux on "Enorkhes".</ref>  '''Evius''' is an epithet of his used prominently in [[Euripides]]' play, ''[[The Bacchae]]''.  '''[[Iacchus]]''', possibly an epithet of Dionysus, is associated with the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]; in [[Eleusis]], he is known as a son of [[Zeus]] and [[Demeter]].  The name "Iacchus" may come from the <U+0399><U+03B1><U+03BA><U+03C7><U+03BF><U+03C2> (''Iakchos''), a hymn sung in honor of Dionysus.  With the epithet '''Liknites''' ("he of the winnowing fan") he is a fertility god connected with the [[mystery religion]]s. A winnowing fan was similar to a [[shovel]] and was used to separate the chaff from the grain.  In addition, Dionysus is known as '''Lyaeus''' ("he who unties") as a god of relaxation and freedom from worry, and as '''Oeneus''' he is the god of the [[wine press]].

In the Greek [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], Dionysus (along with [[Zeus]]) absorbs the role of [[Sabazios]], a [[Phrygia]]n deity.  In the [[Roman mythology|Roman pantheon]], Sabazius became an alternate name for Bacchus.<ref>Rosemarie Taylor-Perry, The God Who Comes: Dionysian Mysteries Revisited. Algora Press 2003, p.89, cf. [[Sabazius]].</ref>
