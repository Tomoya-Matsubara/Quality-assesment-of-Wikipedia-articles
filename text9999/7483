'''Milford railway station''' is a stop on the [[Portsmouth Direct Line]], serving the village of [[Milford, Surrey]] in England.

== Services ==

There is an hourly service to {{stnlnk|Haslemere}} southbound and London Waterloo northbound.

At approximately level gradient but adjoining woodland the track occasionally suffers from leaves on the line resulting in poor traction for trains, in extremis leading to overshoots on stopping and difficulty moving off.
