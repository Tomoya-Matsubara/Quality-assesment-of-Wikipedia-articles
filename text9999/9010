:''This is a sub-article to [[List of unusual units of measurement]]

Many comedians and [[humour]] writers have made use of, or invented, units of measurement intended primarily for their humour value. This is a list of such units invented by sources that are notable for reasons other than having made the unit itself, and of units that are widely known in the [[anglophone]] world for their humour value.

==Conventional==
These units may or may not have precise objectively measurable values, but all of them measure quantities that have been defined within the S.I. system of units.

===Length===
==== Beard-second ====

The '''beard-second''' is a unit of [[length]] inspired by the [[light year]], but used for extremely short distances such as those in [[nuclear physics]]. The beard-second is defined as the length an average physicist's [[beard]] grows in a [[second]].  Kemp Bennet Kolb defines the distance as exactly 100 [[<U+00C5>ngstr<U+00F6>m]]s<ref>{{citation|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wUrZ4buWw60C&pg=PA13&vq=beard-second&source=gbs_search_r&cad=0_1|page=13|title=This Book Warps Space and Time|author=Kemp Bennet Kolb|chapter=The beard-second, a new unit of length|year=2008|isbn=9780740777134}}</ref>  while the ''Physics Handbook'' has it half the size at 5 [[nanometers]].<ref>{{citation|title=Physics Handbook for Science and Engineering|author=C Nordling & J. <U+00D6>sterman|publisher=Studentlitteratur}}</ref>  [[Google Calculator]] supports the beard-second for unit conversions using the latter conversion factor.<ref>http://www.google.com/search?q=6+meters+in+beard-seconds</ref>

====Bloit====
In the [[Zork]] series of games, the Great Underground Empire had its own system of measures, the most frequently referenced of which was the bloit. Defined as the distance the king's favorite pet could run in one hour (spoofing a popular legend about the history of the [[foot (length)|foot]]), the length of the bloit varied dramatically, but the one canonical conversion to real-world units puts it at approximately two-thirds of a [[mile]]. Liquid volume was measured in gloops, and temperature in degrees Q (57<U+00B0>Q is said to be the [[Melting point|freezing point]] of water). <ref>''Encyclopedia Frobozzica'', Infocom, 1993.</ref>

====Potrzebie====
In issue 33, ''[[Mad Magazine|Mad]]'' published a partial table of the "Potrzebie System of Weights and [[Units of measurement|Measures]]", developed by 19-year-old [[Donald E. Knuth]], later a famed [[computer science|computer scientist]]. According to Knuth, the basis of this new revolutionary system is the potrzebie, which equals the thickness of ''Mad'' issue 26, or 2.263348517438173216473 mm.

Volume was measured in ngogn (equal to 1000 cubic potrzebies), mass in [[blintz]] (equal to the mass of 1 ngogn of [[halavah]], which is "a form of pie [with] a [[specific gravity]] of [[Pi|3.1416]] and a specific heat of .31416"), and time in seven named units (decimal powers of the average earth rotation, equal to 1 "clarke"). The system also features such units as ''[[What? Me worry?|whatmeworry]]'', ''[[cowznofski]]'', ''vreeble'', [[hoo-hah|''hoo'']] and [[hoo-hah|''hah'']].

According to the "Date" system in Knuth's article, which substitutes a 10-clarke "mingo" for a month and a 100-clarke "cowznofski," for a year, the date of October 29, 2007, is rendered as "To 1, 190 C. M." (for Cowznofsko Madi, or "in the Cowznofski of our MAD." The dates are calculated from [[October 1]], [[1952]], the date MAD was first published. Dates before this point are referred to (perhaps tongue-in-cheek) as "B.M." ("Before MAD.") The ten "Mingoes" are: Tales (Tal.) Calculated (Cal.) To (To) Drive (Dri.) You (You) Humor (Hum.) In (In) A (A) Jugular (Jug.) Vein (Vei.)

==== Smoot ====
{{main|Smoot}}
The smoot is a unit of length, defined as the height of [[Oliver R. Smoot]] who, fittingly, is a former president of the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]. The unit is used to measure the length of the [[Harvard Bridge]]. Canonically, and originally, in 1958 when Smoot was a [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] pledge at [[MIT]] (class of 1962), the bridge was measured to be 364.4 smoots, plus or minus one ear, using Mr. Smoot himself as a [[ruler]]. At the time, Smoot was 5 [[Foot (length)|feet]], 7 [[inch]]es, or 170 [[Centimetre|cm]], tall.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/smoot.html| title=smoot| work=The Jargon File (version 4.4.7)| accessdate=2006-06-27}}</ref> [[Google Earth]] software includes the smoot as a [[units of measurement|unit of measurement]].

==== Sheppey ====
A measure of distance equal to about 7/8 of a mile, defined as the closest distance at which [[sheep]] remain picturesque. The Sheppey is the creation of [[Douglas Adams]] and [[John Lloyd]], included in [[The Meaning of Liff]], their dictionary of putative meanings for words that are actually just place names. <ref>
''The Meaning of Liff'', Douglas Adams and John Lloyd , 1984. IBSN 0-51755-347-3</ref>
It is named after the [[Isle of Sheppey]] in the UK.

===Spatial volume===
====Barn-megaparsec====
This unit is similar in concept to the attoparsec, combining very large and small scales. A [[barn (unit)|barn]] (b) is a unit of cross-sectional area used in nuclear physics, equal to 10<sup>-28</sup> [[square metre|m<U+00B2>]]. The effective area for interaction of the nucleus of an atom is on the order of magnitude of the barn &mdash;a very small unit of area (itself humorously named after the proverbial "broad side of a barn"). When this is multiplied by the [[parsec|megaparsec]] (Mpc) - a very large unit of length used for measuring the distances between [[galaxies]] - the result is a human-scaled unit of volume approximately equal to 2/3 of a [[teaspoon]] (about 3.0857&nbsp;ml). <!-- no exact fit, closest is the Canadian teaspoon of 1/6 fl oz (Imperial), about 0.652 bMpc -->

====Bottlesworth====
This unit is approximately equal to a [[Wine bottle#Sizes|standard bottle]] of [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]] (0.75 litres), and is designed to allow the use of wine in scientific experiments in the science comedy ''[[Look Around You]]''.

=== Power ===
==== Donkeypower ====
This facetious engineering unit is defined as 250 [[watt]]s<U+2014>about a third of a [[horsepower]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictD.html | title=Rowlett's Dictionary of Units | accessdate=2006-11-08}}</ref>

==Non-Conventional==
These units describe dimensions which are not and can not be covered by the S.I system of units.

=== Earthquake Intensity ===
Tom Weller suggests the humorous Rictus scale (a take off on the conventional [[Richter scale]]) for earthquake intensity.<ref>{{cite book

===Sound Intensity: Phone===
The unit of perceived loudness, [[phon]], is sometimes also called ''phone''. This has led to [[pun]]s such as ''One [[megaphone]] equals 10<sup>12</sup> [[microphone]]s''. While the ''phon'' is a real unit, this intentional misspelling, ''phone'', exists solely for the humour value.

===Beauty: Helen===
[[Helen of Troy]] (from the ''[[Iliad]]'') is widely known as "the face that launched a thousand ships."  Thus, 1 millihelen is the amount of beauty needed to launch a single ship.

According to ''[[The Rebel Angels]]'', a novel by [[Robertson Davies]], this system was invented by Cambridge mathematician [[W.A.H. Rushton]]. However, the term was possibly first suggested by [[Isaac Asimov]].<ref>[http://asimovhumanists.org/AboutIsaacAssimov2.htm Isaac Asimov] </ref> The obvious reference is [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]]'s line from the play [[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]], "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships...?" <ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext97/drfsta10.txt The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus by Christopher Marlowe - Project Gutenberg<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Negative values have also been observed<U+2014>these, of course, are measured by the number of ships sunk or the number of clocks stopped. An alternative interpretation of 1 negative Helen is the amount of negative beauty (i.e. ugliness) that can launch one thousand ships the other way.

Since the original quotation was "Was this the face that launch'd a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium", a more accurate definition of the millihelen might be the amount of beauty required to launch a single ship and ignite a wastebasket.

David Lance Goines has written a humorous article<ref>[http://66.117.155.127/Writing/HELEN_of_TROY.html On the Inefficiency of Beauty Contests and a Suggestion for Their Modernization]</ref> describing various Helen-units. It has a chart with the fire-lighting and ship-launching capability for different powers of "Helens".  For example, a Picohelen (ph) (10^-12 helens) indicates the amount of beauty that can "Barbecue a couple of Steaks & Toss an Inner Tube Into the Pool".

[[Thomas Fink]], in [[The Man's Book]]<ref>Fink, ''The Man's Book'' (London, 2006), pp. 44-45; [http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~tmf20/]</ref> defines beauty both in terms of ships launched, but also in terms of the number of women one women will, on average, be more beautiful than. One Helen (H) is the quantity of beauty to be more beautiful than 50 million women, the number of women estimated to have been alive in the 12th century BC. Ten Helena (Ha) is the beauty sufficient for one oarsmen (of which 50 are on a ship) to risk his life, or be the most beautiful of a thousand women. Beauty is logarithmic on a base of 2. For beauty to increase by 1 Ha, a woman must be the most beautiful of twice as many women. One Helen is 25.6 Ha. The most beautiful woman which ever lived would score 34.2 Ha, and 1.34 H, the pick of a dozen women would be 3.6 Ha, and 0.14 H.

===Bogosity: Lenat===
The unit of [[bogosity]], derived from the fictional field of Quantum Bogodynamics. The [[Douglas Lenat|Lenat]] is seldom used, as it is understood that it is too large for normal conversation. Its most common form is the microlenat.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dourish.com/goodies/jargon.html | title=The Original Hacker's Dictionary | accessdate=2006-11-08}}</ref>

===Coolness: MegaFonzie===
A [[Fonzie#References in popular culture|MegaFonzie]] is a fictional unit of measurement of an object's coolness invented by [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] in the [[Futurama]] episode, [[Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV]]. A 'Fonzie' is about the amount of coolness inherent in the ''[[Happy Days]]'' character [[Fonzie]].<ref>http://www.thegameslave.com/Misc/Science/TreatiseonUnitsofMeasure.htm</ref>

===Duration: Stobart===
Based on the name of a UK haulage company the [[Eddie Stobart Ltd.| Stobart]] is the interval that one driver of one [[articulated lorry]] can go between [[bacon sandwich| bacon sandwiches]] and [[builders tea| cups of stewed, over-sweet, tea]].  Depending on congestion the Stobart is either a unit of time or distance. {{Fact|date=April 2008}}

===Magical Energy: Thaum===
{{main|Minor Discworld concepts#Thaum}}
The Thaum is a measuring unit used in the [[Terry Pratchett]] series of Discworld novels to quantify [[magic]]. It equals the amount of mystical energy required to conjure up one small white pigeon, or three normal-sized billiard balls. It can, of course, be measured with a thaumometer, and regular SI-modifiers apply (e.g. millithaum, kilothaum). <ref>{{cite book

  | first = Terry

  | publisher = Doubleday London

  | isbn = 0-385-40989-3 }}</ref>

A thaumometer looks like a black cube with a dial on one side. A standard one is good for up to a million thaums - if there is more magic than that around, measuring it should not be your primary concern.

It is not to be confused with the magical particle "thaum" from the same series of novels.

===Pleasure:  Hedon===
Philosophers talking about [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s [[Utilitarianism]] sometimes use the conceptual unit of the Hedon to describe the amount of pleasure, equivalent to the amount of pleasure a person receives from gaining one [[util]] of [[utility]]. <ref>EG, "Utilitarianism and the Wrongness of Killing", Richard G. Henson, ''The Philosophical Review'' Vol. 80, No. 3  (Jul., 1971), pp. 320-337.</ref>

===Fame: Warhol===
This is a unit of fame or [[hype]], derived from [[Andy Warhol]]'s dictum "everyone will be world-famous for fifteen minutes" <U+2014> it represents, naturally, [[fifteen minutes of fame]]. Some multiples are:
*1&nbsp;kilowarhol <U+2014> famous for 15,000&nbsp;minutes, or 10.42&nbsp;days. A sort of [[Metric system|metric]] "nine day wonder".
*1&nbsp;megawarhol <U+2014> famous for 15&nbsp;million&nbsp;minutes, or 28.5&nbsp;years.

First used by [[Cullen Murphy]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.slate.com/id/3175/| title=Too Much of a Good Thing <U+2014> How much hype is overhype?| first=Cullen| last=Murphy| month=[[2 October]]| year=1997| publisher=Slate.com|accessdate=2006-03-10}}</ref>

Also used simply as meaning 15&nbsp;minutes; as the [[Warhol worm]], that could infect all vulnerable machines on the entire Internet in 15&nbsp;minutes or less.

===Smell: Hobo Power===
Hobo Power is a unit coined by [[Adam Carolla]] and [[Drew Pinsky|Dr. Drew]] on the radio show ''[[Loveline]]'' as a measure of how bad something smells {{Fact|date=April 2008}}. Some noted reference points include:

*0 hobo <U+2014> Doesn't smell bad at all
*13 hobo - "A robust [[fart]]"
*30 hobo - The smeller ''must'' vomit.
*50 hobo <U+2014> Carolla suggested the hypothetical: "50 hobo power is a cat that's been fed nothing but [[blue cheese]] for a week defecating on a [[black body|white-hot]] [[hibachi]]."
*100 hobo <U+2014> Purely theoretical (comparable to [[absolute zero]]).  Near 100 hobo would cause death by asphyxiation.

A running section of [[The Adam Carolla Show]] involves callers relating foul-smelling situations for which the hosts then determine the equivalent Hobo Power.
