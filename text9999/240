'''Tooth squeeze''' (or ''squeeze'') is a pain experienced by people who undergo rapid changes of pressure.  These rapid changes cause air inside a tooth to expand or contract quickly.  This air is usually found underneath a [[dental fillings|filling]].  The most common victims are [[Scuba set|SCUBA]] divers (because in deep dives pressures can increase by several [[atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]]) and military [[pilots]] (because of rapid changes in unpressurized cabins).
