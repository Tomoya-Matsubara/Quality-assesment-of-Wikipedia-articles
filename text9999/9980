'''Devin Garret Townsend''' (born May 5, 1972) is a Canadian [[musician]] and [[record producer]] best known as the co-founder, [[vocalist]] and [[guitarist]] in [[extreme metal]] outfit [[Strapping Young Lad]], and for his extensive work as a solo artist.

After performing in a number of [[heavy metal music|metal]] bands in [[education in Canada|high school]], Townsend was discovered by a record label in 1993 and was asked to perform lead vocals on [[Steve Vai]]'s album ''[[Sex & Religion]]''. After recording and touring with Vai, Townsend was discouraged by what he found in the music industry, and vented his anger on [[Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing|a solo album]] released under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He soon assembled a band under the name, and released the critically acclaimed ''[[City (Strapping Young Lad album)|City]]'' in 1997. Since then, he has continued to write and record albums with Strapping Young Lad, along with solo material released under his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records. Townsend's solo releases, a diverse mix of [[hard rock]] and [[progressive metal]], have featured a varying lineup of supporting musicians. In 2002 he formed The Devin Townsend Band, a dedicated lineup which recorded and toured for two of his solo releases.

Townsend's trademark production style, featuring a heavily multitracked [[wall of sound]], has been compared to the styles of [[Phil Spector]] and [[Frank Zappa]]. His versatile vocal delivery ranges from [[screaming (music)|screaming]] to [[clean vocals|singing]], and his songwriting is similarly diverse. Townsend's musical style is rooted in metal, and his albums are written to express different aspects of his personality.

In 2007, Townsend disbanded both Strapping Young Lad and The Devin Townsend Band in order to spend more time with his family and less time touring. Townsend has since produced a number of albums for other groups, and continues to write and release self-produced albums from his home studio. Townsend is currently working on a four-album series called the Devin Townsend Project, with each album being written in a different style. The first entry in the series, ''[[Ki (album)|Ki]]'', was released in May 2009.

==Biography==
===Early musical career (1972<U+2013>1996)===
[[File:Caustic Thought - Kelowna, BC, 1992.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Townsend ''(right)'' playing with Caustic Thought in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], 1992.]]

Around the same time he joined a popular local group called Caustic Thought, replacing [[Jed Simon]] on guitar and playing alongside [[bassist]] [[Byron Stroud]], both of whom would later become members of Townsend's flagship band, [[Strapping Young Lad]].<ref name="zimmershole">"[http://zimmershole.com/666/profiles/zh_jedsimon.html Profile: Jed Simon]." ''Zimmers Hole'' (official site).</ref> In 1993, Townsend began writing material under the name Noisescapes, a project he later described as "just as violent as Strapping Young Lad".<ref name="hard-rock-interview-1995">{{cite web |url=http://www.hevydevy.com/press/online_interview/1995_interview_hardrock.html |title=Strapping Young Lad |publisher=''Hard Rock Magazine'' |date=August/September 1995 |author=Gewgaw, Herv<U+00E9> S.K.; trans. Billerey, Roger}}</ref>

Townsend recorded a Noisescapes demo and sent copies to various record labels. <!-- wrapped in pairs of his used underwear to attract attention.<ref name="hdr-biography" /> --> [[Relativity Records]] responded to Townsend with a record deal and Townsend began work on what was to be the first Noisescapes album, ''Promise''.<ref name="diperna-199309" /> Shortly afterward, the label introduced him to musician [[Steve Vai]]. Impressed with Townsend's vocal work, Vai offered him the role of the lead vocalist on his new album ''[[Sex & Religion|Sex and Religion]]''. Townsend took the offer, unfamiliar with Vai's work and unaware of his acclaim in the music world. After recording ''Sex and Religion'', Townsend accompanied Vai on a world tour in support of the album.<ref name="diperna-199309">{{cite journal |title=Shrieking Havoc |last=Diperna |first=Alex |year=1993 |month=September |journal=[[Guitar World]] |publisher=[[Future US]] |location=South San Francisco, California |issn=1045-6295 |oclc=7982091}}</ref> Townsend's over-the-top personality and antics left him with a poor reputation after the ''Sex and Religion'' tour, and he ended up working in a Vancouver restaurant. This setback was brief, and Townsend soon landed a second touring gig, this time with the opening band of Vai's tour, [[The Wildhearts]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Alex S. |year=2005 |month=January/February |title=Devin Townsend interrogated |journal=[[Zero Tolerance Magazine]] |issue=3 |publisher=Obdurate Ltd |issn=1742-9897 |oclc=266995054}}</ref> He played live with the band throughout half of 1994 in [[Europe]], and appeared as a guest musician on their single [[Urge (Wildhearts)|Urge]]. [[Ginger (singer)|Ginger]], the band's frontman, remained close friends with Townsend,<ref name="zell-20011124">{{cite journal |last=Zell |first=Ray |date=November 24, 2001 |title=The Nutty Professor |journal=[[Kerrang]] |issue=880 |page=34 |publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]] |issn=0262-6624 |oclc=32328241}}</ref> later co-writing several songs on ''[[Infinity (Devin Townsend album)|Infinity]]'' and the ''Christeen + 4 Demos'' EP.

While on tour with The Wildhearts, Townsend formed a short-lived [[thrash metal]] project with with [[Metallica]]'s then-[[bass guitar|bassist]] [[Jason Newsted]]. The band, known as [[IR8 vs. Sexoturica|IR8]], featured Newsted on vocals and bass, Townsend on guitar, and [[Tom Hunting]] of [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]] on drums. The group recorded a few songs together, although Townsend says that they never intended to go further than that. "People heard about it and thought we wanted to put out a CD, which is absolutely not true," he explains. "People took this project way too seriously."<ref name="hard-rock-interview-1995" /> A demo tape was put together, but the material was not released until 2002, when Newsted published the [[IR8 vs. Sexoturica]] compilation.

Though Townsend was proud of what he had accomplished so early in his career, he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry. "I was becoming a product of somebody else's imagination, and it was mixing with my own personality," he later reflected. "This combination was appalling."<ref name="lageat-2001" /> He pushed to get his own projects off the ground. Despite getting notable touring gigs with other musicians, however, Townsend continued to face rejection of his own music. Relativity Records dropped Noisescapes from their label shortly after Townsend accepted Vai's offer, seeing no commercial appeal in Townsend's music.<ref name="chronicles-interview-1995">{{cite web|title=Bracing for Success - CoC interviews Devin Townsend of Strapping Young Lad|publisher=[[Chronicles of Chaos]]|author=Bromley, Adrian|url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/chats/1-7_strapping_young_lad.aspx|accessdate=January 31, 2008|date=January 10, 1995}}</ref> "I have a hunch they only offered me a deal to get me to sing with Steve," he mused.<ref name="hard-rock-interview-1995" /> While touring with The Wildhearts, Townsend received a phone call from an [[A&R]] representative for [[Roadrunner Records]], expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him. The offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of Roadrunner, who regarded Townsend's recordings as "just noise".<ref name="Devin Townsend interviewed by Tony on 3RRR FM, Melbourne">{{cite web|title=Devin Townsend interviewed by Tony on 3RRR FM, Melbourne|publisher=The Church of Devin Townsend|url=http://www.axs.com.au/~vk3aaw/devhard1.htm|accessdate=January 31, 2008|month=April | year=1997}}</ref>

In 1994, Century Media Records offered Townsend a contract to make "some extreme albums".<ref name="Devin Townsend interviewed by Tony on 3RRR FM, Melbourne" /> He agreed to a five-album deal with the record label<ref>{{cite news|title=Devin Townsend: 'I Don't Have Anything To Say With Strapping Young Lad  Anymore'|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=54611|accessdate=January 31, 2008|date=July 4, 2006}}</ref> and began to record material under the pseudonym [[Strapping Young Lad]]. Townsend avoided using his real name at this point in career, looking for a fresh start after his high-profile Vai gig. "At the beginning, I wanted to avoid at all cost to use my name because I was known as the singer for Steve Vai and it wasn't the best publicity to have," he later explained. "I was playing somebody else's music and I was judged in respect to that music."<ref name="lageat-2001" /> Townsend produced and performed nearly all the instruments on the debut studio album, ''[[Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing]]'', which was released in April 1995. Following the release of the record, Townsend and several other musician friends he knew in Vancouver recorded an album in 1996 entitled ''[[Cooked on Phonics]]'' for another one-off side project, [[Punky Br<U+00FC>ster]]. Written and recorded in under a month, the album was produced as a parody of [[punk rock]] bands and documents the act of selling out for mainstream success.

===''City'' and ''Ocean Machine: Biomech'' (1996<U+2013>1997)===
Townsend assembled a permanent lineup of Strapping Young Lad to record ''[[City (Strapping Young Lad album)|City]]'', including prolific metal drummer [[Gene Hoglan]], along with Townsend's former bandmates [[Jed Simon]] on guitar and [[Byron Stroud]] on bass. The [[industrial music|industrial]]-influenced<ref name="popoff-2003" /> album was released in 1997. To this day, the album is widely considered Strapping Young Lad's best work,<ref>{{cite web|title=Strapping Young Lad - The New Black review|author=Bergman, Keith|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=788|accessdate=January 31, 2008}}</ref><ref name="PopMatters - Alien review">{{cite web|title=Strapping Young Lad: Alien review|author=Begrand, Adrien|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/strappingyounglad-alien|accessdate=January 31, 2008|date=March 25, 2005}}</ref> with ''[[Metal Maniacs]]'' calling it "groundbreaking"<ref name="maniacs-200309">{{cite journal |last=G. |first=Mike |year=2003 |months=September |title=The Devin Townsend Band: No Holds Barred |journal=[[Metal Maniacs]] |issn=1559-4297 |oclc=62782997}}</ref> and ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' naming it "one of the greatest metal albums of all time".<ref>{{cite journal |title=The 69 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time |journal=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]] |year=2002 |month=September/October |publisher=Future US |location=South San Francisco, California |issn=1527-408X |oclc=42757765}}</ref> Townsend himself considers it the band's "ultimate" album.<ref>{{cite web|title=Strapping Young Lad Are All Rocked Out|publisher=''[[Exclaim!]]''|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/points.aspx?csid1=82|accessdate=April 28, 2008|month=July | year=2006}}</ref> Later that year, Townsend released his first solo album, ''[[Ocean Machine: Biomech]]''. The album featured a mix of [[hard rock]], [[ambient music|ambient]], and [[progressive rock]].<ref name="maniacs-200309" /> Townsend founded his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records, to release the album.<ref name="maniacs-200309" />
<!--Dating back to the ''Sex and Religion'' tour, Townsend had been writing solo material for a project called Ocean Machine. The album, initially entited ''[[Ocean Machine: Biomech|Biomech]]'', was recorded in 1995 and originally queued for release later that year in December on [[HevyDevy Records]], a label created by Townsend solely for material he releases on his own. Due to unknown reasons, ''Biomech'' was put off for release until late 1996, but when the time came to finally release it, Townsend had become unsatisfied with the recordings and decided to rerecord the album from scratch. Finally released in [[Japan]] on July 21, 1997, the album sold 12,000 copies throughout its first week of sales.{{fact}}-->

===''Infinity'' through ''Terria'' (1997<U+2013>2001)===
After the completion of ''City'' and ''Biomech'', Townsend began to approach a mental breakdown. "I started to see human beings as little lonesome, water based, pink meat," he explained, "life forms pushing air through themselves and making noises that the other little pieces of meat seemed to understand." In 1997, he checked himself into a mental-health hospital, where he was diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]]. The diagnosis helped him understand where the two sides of his music were coming from; he felt his disorder "gave birth to the two extremes that are Strapping's ''City'' record and Ocean Machine's ''Biomech''."<ref name="fbm-interview">{{cite web| url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070522103216/http://www.farbeyondmetal.com/index.php?page_id=1120 |title=Metal Hammer Interviews Devin |publisher=''Far Beyond Metal'' |author=Ingham, Chris |year=1998 |accessdate=November 21, 2007}}</ref> After being discharged from the hospital, Townsend found that "everything just clicked" and he was able to write his second solo album, ''[[Infinity (Devin Townsend album)|Infinity]]'', which he described as "the parent project" of ''City'' and ''Biomech'',<ref name="fbm-interview" /> with music influenced by [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].<ref name="maniacs-200309" /> Townsend returned to the studio, accompanied by Hoglan, to work on the album, on which Townsend played most of the instruments. ''Infinity'' was released in October 1998. Later in his career, Townsend has cited ''Infinity'' as his favorite solo record.<ref name="popoff-2003">{{cite journal |last=Popoff |first=Martin |year=2003 |month=Winter<U+2013>Spring |title=Strapping Young Lad |journal=Lollipop Magazine |issue=61 |oclc=36854274}}</ref>

With ''Infinity'', Townsend began to label all albums outside of Strapping Young Lad under his own name, dropping the Ocean Machine moniker, to reduce confusion. He wanted to show that despite the highly varied nature of his projects, they are all simply aspects of his identity.<ref name="lageat-2001">

Townsend's bandmates began to play two sets at their shows, one as Strapping Young Lad, and one as The Devin Townsend Band, playing songs from Townsend's solo albums.<ref name="hdr-biography" />

Townsend's next project took several years to come to fruition. After the creation of the IR8 demo tape, Townsend and Jason Newsted had begun work on a new project called ''Fizzicist'', which they described as "heavier than Strapping Young Lad". When the IR8 tape was leaked, Newsted's Metallica bandmates [[James Hetfield]] and [[Lars Ulrich]] learned of the project. Hetfield was "fucking pissed" that Newsted was playing outside the band, and Newsted was prevented by his bandmates from working on any more side projects.<ref name="metallica-world-interview">{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/21395550/cover_story_pretty_hate_machine/ |date=June 27, 1996 |author=Fricke, David |title=Pretty Hate Machine |publisher=''Rolling Stone'' |accessdate=November 26, 2008 }}</ref> With the project stalled, Townsend instead wrote the album himself, entitling it ''[[Physicist (album)|Physicist]]''.

Feeling he had "ostracized a bunch of fans" with ''Physicist'', Townsend felt he had the chance to make a more personal and honest record.<ref name="popoff-2003" /> Townsend was inspired one morning while driving across Canada with his band, and looked to write an "introspective" album dedicated to his homeland.<ref name="small-200111">{{cite journal |last=Small |first=Aaron |year=2001 |month=November |title=Devin Townsend: Diary of a Madman |journal=[[Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles]] |location=Toronto |issn=1705-3781 |oclc=57191652}}</ref> He produced and recorded ''[[Terria]]'', a "highly illustrated stream-of-consciousness" album,<ref name="popoff-2003" /> with Gene Hoglan on drums, Craig McFarland on bass and Jamie Meyer on keyboards. Townsend cited [[Ween]]'s ''[[White Pepper]]'' as an inspiration for the album.<ref name="popoff-2003" /> ''Terria'' was released in November 2001.

===''Strapping Young Lad'' through ''Synchestra'' (2003<U+2013>2006)===
Townsend's solo run lasted until 2002. After a five-year break from recording, Strapping Young Lad reunited to record a new album. Townsend credits the album, ''[[Strapping Young Lad (album)|Strapping Young Lad]]'', as an emotional response to the [[September 11 attacks|attacks of September 11, 2001]], in the [[United States]]. "If the world's about to blow up," said Townsend, "let's write the soundtrack for it."<ref name="metal-rules-interview-2003" /> The album's lyrics were based more around fear and insecurity than the "hostile" lyrics of ''City''.<ref name="popoff-2003" /> Musically, ''Strapping Young Lad'' was less [[industrial music|industrial]] than ''City'',<ref name="Chain D.L.K. interview">{{cite web|title=Interview with Strapping Young Lad|publisher=Chain D.L.K.|author=Hamilton, Shaun|url=http://www.chaindlk.com/interviews/index.php?interview=StrappingYoungLad|accessdate=January 31, 2008|date=March 20, 2003}}</ref> and more reminiscent of death metal,<ref>{{cite web|title=SYL Review|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|author=Hinds, Andy|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:apfyxqraldhe~T1|accessdate=January 31, 2008}}</ref> with a "larger-than-life" [[rock music|rock]] production style.<ref name="popoff-2003" /> Townsend cited [[Front Line Assembly]], [[Grotus]], and [[Samael (band)|Samael]]'s ''[[Passage (Samael album)|Passage]]'' as influences.<ref name="popoff-2003" /> The self-titled album was released in February 2003.

While Strapping Young Lad was being reunited, Townsend formed a new, permanent band "on par with Strapping" to record and tour for his solo releases.<ref name="popoff-2003" /> The Devin Townsend Band consisted of Brian Waddell on [[guitar]], Mike Young on [[Bass guitar|bass]], [[Ryan Van Poederooyen]] on drums, and [[Dave Young (musician)|Dave Young]] on keyboards.

From home, Townsend completed his second solo ambient album, ''[[The Hummer]]'', releasing it exclusively on his website in November 2006.

In May 2007, Townsend released ''[[Ziltoid the Omniscient]]'', a tongue-in-cheek [[rock opera]] about the eponymous fictional [[extraterrestrial|alien]]. Townsend recorded the album alone in its entirety; he utilized [[Drumkit from Hell]], a [[software]] [[drum machine]] used by [[Meshuggah]] on their album ''[[Catch Thirtythree]]'', for the drum tracks.<ref>Lee, Cosmo (2007). "[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:gvfqxzy5ldte ''Ziltoid the Omniscient'': Review]." ''[[Allmusic]]''.</ref> Shortly after the album's release, Townsend announced that he no longer planned to tour or make albums with Strapping Young Lad or The Devin Townsend Band. He explained that he was "burnt out on travelling, touring, and self promotion" and wished to do production work, write albums, and spend time with his family without the stress of interviews or touring.<ref>Townsend, Devin (May 10, 2007). "[http://hevydevyforums.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6699 From Dev.]" ''HevyDevy Forums''. Retrieved November 26, 2008.</ref>

In 2008, Townsend lent his voice to characters in several episodes of the [[Adult Swim]] [[cartoon]] ''[[Metalocalypse]]'' (see [[Metalocalypse#Musician cameos|Musician cameos in ''Metalocalypse'']] for more). The original character design for [[Dethklok#Pickles|Pickles the Drummer]], one of the series' main characters, bore a striking resemblance to Townsend. The series' co-creator [[Brendan Small]] acknowledged the similarity, and altered the design before the series began. "We made sure he didn't look like Devin Townsend. We gave him the goatee and the dreadover so he wouldn't look like that."<ref name="small-interview">{{cite web |url=http://www.thecultureshock.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=28&Itemid=44 |title="Metalocalypse" Brendon and Tommy |date=September 21, 2006 |author=Douglas, Patrick |publisher=''The Culture Shock'' |accessdate=November 25, 2008 }}</ref> <!-- Turner and Townsend threatened legal action when the characters were first revealed; this was a saga on the HDR message board that can be added here. -->

===Devin Townsend Project (2008<U+2013>present)===
After removing himself from the music industry, Townsend cut his trademark hair off<ref name="podcast-20090510">Genghis & Ragman (May 10, 2009). "[http://therighttorock.com/?p=440 Podcast #80 <U+2013> Idol]." ''The Right to Rock''.</ref> and gave up drinking and smoking.<ref name="raven-2009" /> Townsend found it "disconcerting" that he had difficulty writing music without drugs, and that he had trouble identifying his purpose as a musician. He spent a year producing albums in absence of writing, but found it unrewarding and decided to "pick up the guitar and just write".<ref name="podcast-20090510" /> This began a period of "self discovery"<ref name="raven-2009">Raven, Paul Graham (April 11, 2009). "[http://www.rock-metal-music-reviews.com/interview-devin-townsend/ Interview: Devin Townsend]." ''The Dreaded Press''. Retrieved April 14, 2009.</ref> where he learned "how to create without drugs".<ref name="blabbermouth-20090320">''Blabbermouth.net'' (March 20, 2009). "[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BLABBERMOUTH.NET/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=116527 Devin Townsend to return this summer with ''Ki'']." Retrieved April 12, 2009.</ref>

Over two years, Townsend wrote over 60 songs, and found that they fit into "four distinct styles".<ref name="podcast-20090510" /> In March 2009, Townsend announced his plans for a four-album series called the Devin Townsend Project,<ref name="blabbermouth-20090320" /> with the goal of clarifying his musical identity and being "accountable" for the persona he projects to the public.<ref name="podcast-20090510" /> The project's concept includes a different "theme" and a different group of musicians on each album.<ref name="blabbermouth-20090320" /> 

''[[Ki (album)|Ki]]'', the first album of the Devin Townsend Project, was written to "set the stage" for the subsequent albums.<ref name="blabbermouth-20090320" /> Townsend channeled his newfound control and sobriety into ''Ki'', a "tense, quiet" album that contrasts with much of the music he had been known for.<ref name="podcast-20090510" /> ''Ki'' was released in May 2009.<ref>InsideOut Music. "[http://www.insideout.de/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=645 Devin Townsend <U+2013> ''Ki'']."</ref> After ''Ki'', Townsend plans a "commercial, yet heavy" album called ''[[Addicted (Devin Townsend album)|Addicted]]'', followed by the "chaotic" ''[[Deconstruction (Devin Townsend album)|Deconstruction]]'' which represents what Townsend "was trying to achieve with Strapping Young Lad."<ref name="podcast-20090510" /> The fourth album, currently untitled, will be a [[New Age music|New Age]]<ref name="podcast-20090510" /> [[ambient music|ambient]]<ref name="blabbermouth-20090320" /> record. Townsend has announced that "universe willing", all four albums in the Devin Townsend Project will be released in 2009, and they will be followed up next year by an eight-disc box-set, containing all four albums, as well as four bonus discs (including videos) and a booklet. After the completion of the project, Townsend plans to return to the live stage at select locations worldwide to play music from the four albums.<ref name="blabbermouth-20090320" />

Townsend designed his two main projects, the aggressive [[Strapping Young Lad]] and his more melodic solo material, as counterparts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Devin Townsend|publisher=Metal-Rules.com|author=Hawkins, Chris|url=http://metal-rules.com/interviews/Devin.htm|accessdate=January 31, 2008}}</ref> Strapping Young Lad's music was a diverse mix of [[extreme metal]] genres; death metal, thrash metal, [[black metal]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Alien review|publisher=''[[Decibel Magazine|Decibel]]'' magazine|author=Terry, Nick|url=http://www.decibelmagazine.com/reviews/apr2005/strapping_young_lad.aspx|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060506005044/http://www.decibelmagazine.com/reviews/apr2005/strapping_young_lad.aspx|archivedate=March 6, 2006|accessdate=January 31, 2008}}</ref> and industrial metal.

As a self-proclaimed "fan of [[Multitrack recording|multitracking]]",<ref name="revelationz-interview-2006" /> Townsend has developed a trademark production style featuring an atmospheric, layered "wall of sound".<ref name="Cleveland Scene">{{cite web|title=The Devin Townsend Band - Synchestra|publisher=''Cleveland Scene''|author=Lay, David|url=http://www.bigcity.com/2006-02-08/music/the-devin-townsend-band/|accessdate=December 2, 2008|date=February 8, 2006}}</ref> Townsend has drawn critical praise for his productions, which "are always marked by a sense of adventure, intrigue, chaotic atmospherics and overall aural pyrotechnics", according to Mike G. of ''[[Metal Maniacs]]''.<ref name="maniacs-200309" /> Townsend uses software suites such as [[Pro Tools]], [[Steinberg Cubase]], and [[Logic Pro]] when recording, mixing, and producing his music.<ref name="revelationz-interview-2006" /> Townsend's musical ideas and production style have drawn comparisons to [[Phil Spector]]<ref name="Cleveland Scene"/> and [[Frank Zappa]].<ref name="AMG Alien Review">{{cite web|title=Alien Review|publisher=Allmusic|author=Rivadavia, Eduardo|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:3zftxqqsldfe~T1|accessdate=January 31, 2008}}</ref>
