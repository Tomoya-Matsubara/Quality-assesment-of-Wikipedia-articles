The '''''Cotton Plantation Record and Account Book''''', first published in 1847 or 1848 by [[Thomas Affleck (accountant)|Thomas Affleck]], originally of [[Brenham, Texas]], was a bestselling and pioneering guide to farm accounting in the [[antebellum]] cotton-producing regions of the United States.  It contained a detailed system, which included blank tables to be filled in, that allowed plantation owners to track the efficiency of their production.  It also included essays on various aspects of plantation management, including the proper care and discipline of [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]].

==History and influence==
Thomas Affleck, of Brenham, Texas,<ref name=remlap/> published the first edition of the ''Cotton Plantation Record and Account Book'' in 1847<ref name=dark/> or 1848.<ref name=remlap>{{cite book|author=L. T.

Tyler & Company|page=531}}</ref>  Affleck had purchased a cotton plantation near [[Washington, Mississippi]] in 1842<ref name=quarter/> Later, discussing the origin of his Account Book, Affleck wrote:
<blockquote>
During my first year's planting, I prepared two books with the pen, almost identical to that now published for the cotton plantation, and gave one to each of my next year's overseers, making it a part of my contract with them, that these books were to be correctly kept and returned to me at the end of the year.  And, with a little assistance and encouragement, it was done.  And what a satisfaction it was to me!  Soon after that, at the suggestion of a New Orleans Publisher, I prepared him a transcript of the plan for publication.<ref name=quarter/>
</blockquote>

Affleck published new editions every year thereafter until the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=dark>{{cite book|author=Walter Johnson|title=River of Dark Dreams|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0MgHP0OYvaYC&pg=PT281|date=26 February 2013|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-07490-3|page=281}}</ref>  After the war, the name of the book was changed to ''The Farmers' Record and Account Book'' and the scope widened to include "any system of husbandry, ... the products of any climate, and ... farms of any extent."<ref name=remlap/>  Affleck's book was a consistent [[antebellum]] bestseller<ref name=dark/> in the cotton producing states<ref name=mind>{{cite book|author1=Elizabeth Fox-Genovese|author2=Eugene D.

Historian [[Mark M. Smith]] has noted that "it was precisely on plantations that masters employed the most rigorous, capitalist management techniques," which created a need for specialized ledgers and accounting techniques, Affleck's being "one of the most popular [of these] record book brands."<ref name=disturbing>{{cite book|author=Melanie Benson Taylor|title=Disturbing Calculations: The Economics of Identity in Postcolonial Southern Literature, 1912-2002|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Er5UNgErB-IC&pg=PA61|year=2008|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-3672-5|page=61}}</ref>  By the end of the 1850s, Affleck's Account Book had sold over three thousand copies, contributing to his powerful influence on the direction of the "plantation economy into scientific and systematic channels."<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Agricultural History|volume=15|number=4|date=October 1941|author=Wendell H.

According to historian Robert Williams, Affleck's manual included "a number of other forms which marked an improvement in the system of rural book-keeping.  The record forms were essentially consistent with the intent and purpose of modern cost-accounting, and followed the best and most advanced principles of efficient administrative management."<ref name=missionary/>

==Contents==

The book contained a detailed system which allowed plantation owners to record and track the accounts of their plantations, including pounds of cotton produced per slave, per acre, per bale and the [[gross (economics)|gross]] and [[net (economics)|net]] value of production.<ref name=dark/>  Space was also provided for recording births and deaths of slaves, their clothing and tools, and other such assets and debits.<ref name=quarter/>  Unlike many contemporary systems of agricultural book-keeping, Affleck's book took account of [[depreciation]], the costs of labor, and other "often neglected factors."<ref name=missionary>{{cite journal|title=Thomas Affleck: Missionary to the Planter, the Farmer, and the Gardener|author=Robert W.

===''The Duties of an Overseer''===
The Account Book included Affleck's essay, ''The Duties of an Overseer'', which noted that one of the most important aspects "of a fine crop is an increase in the number and a marked increase in the condition and value of the negroes."<ref>{{cite journal|title=Antebellum Planters and Vorm<U+00E4>rz Junkers in Comparative Perspective|author=Shearer Davis Bowman|pages=779-808|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=85|number=4|date=October, 1980|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1868872}}{{paywall}}</ref>  Slaveowners, for various reasons, were willing or eager to allow their slaves to attend religious services<ref name=jordan>{{cite book|author=Eugene D.

<blockquote>
You will find that an hour devoted every Sabbath morning to their moral and religious instruction would prove a great aid to you in bringing about a better state of things amongst the Negroes.  It has been thoroughly tried, and with the most satisfactory results, in many parts of the South.  As a matter of mere interest it has proved to be advisable, to say nothing of it as a point of duty.  The effect upon their general good behavior, their cleanliness, and good conduct on the Sabbath is such as alone to recommend it to the Planter and Overseer.<ref name=jordan/>
