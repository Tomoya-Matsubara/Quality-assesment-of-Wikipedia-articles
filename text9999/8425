The Fighting Peacock is associated with decades-long democratic struggle against military dictatorship in the country. The latter closely resembles a Green Peafowl, as it has a tufted crest.]]

The '''National League for Democracy''' ({{lang-my|<U+1021><U+1019><U+103B><U+102D><U+102F><U+1038><U+101E><U+102C><U+1038><U+1012><U+102E><U+1019><U+102D><U+102F><U+1000><U+101B><U+1031><U+1005><U+102E><U+1021><U+1016><U+103D><U+1032><U+1037><U+1001><U+103B><U+102F><U+1015><U+103A>}}) is a [[Burma|Burmese]] political party founded on [[27 September]] [[1988]]. It is led by [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], who acts as General Secretary.

==Overview==
The party was formed in the aftermath of the [[8888 Uprising]]. In the [[Burmese general election, 1990|1990 parliamentary elections]], the party won 392 out of 492 contested seats (80.8%) compared to 10 seats by the government [[National Unity Party (Burma)|National Unity Party]];<ref>Houtman, Daigaku & Kenky<U+016B>jo,  1999, p. 1</ref>  however the ruling [[military junta]] (formerly known as ''[[SLORC]]'', now known as the [[State Peace and Development Council]] or ''SPDC'') did not let the party form a government.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25503318-16741,00.html Junta must free Burma's leading lady], ''[[The Australian]]'', May 19, 2009</ref> Soon after the election, the party was repressed, but a number of elected representatives escaped arrest and formed the [[National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma]] (NCGUB) to carry out the struggle for [[democracy]] and [[Freedom (political)|freedom]].

The NLD is distinct from the NLD-LA (National League for Democracy-Liberated Areas), which operates in the [[Thailand|Thai]]-Burma border areas and abroad.  However, the NLD-LA advocates the position of the NLD in calling for a tripartite dialogue between the SPDC, the NLD, and representatives of the [[List of ethnic groups in Burma|ethnic minority groups of Burma]].

In 2001, the government permitted NLD office branches to re-open throughout Burma and released some members.<ref>[http://www.aappb.org/report7_confidence_building_pp.pdf Burma's Confidence Building and Political Prisoners], Assistance Association for Political Prisoners</ref> However, they were shut down or heavily restricted from 2004, as part of a government campaign to prohibit such activities. In 2006, many members resigned from NLD, citing harassment and pressure from the [[Tatmadaw]] (Armed Forces) and the [[Union Solidarity and Development Association]].

[[Aung San Suu Kyi]], NLD general secretary and 1991 [[Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace]] Laureate, remains under [[house arrest]]. The military has held her in detention for 14 of the last 20 years.  She is the only Nobel Peace Laureate in detention in the world today.
