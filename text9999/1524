The collective emerged in the mid-1990s<ref name="faq"/> from its beginnings as ''[[Inside Front]]'', and began operating as a collective in 1996.<ref name="thompson"/> It has since published widely-read propaganda for the anarchist movement.<ref name=brandt>Brandt, Jed.

Several divisions of the group have published books, while others have released [[record]]s or organized large-scale national campaigns against [[globalization]] and [[representative democracy]] in favor of radical community organizing. Less public splinter groups have carried out [[direct action]] (including [[arson]] and [[hacktivism]]), hosted international conventions and other events, maintained local chapters, sparked riots and toured with multimedia [[performance art]] and/or hardcore anarcho-punk musical ensembles. The collective has received national media and academic attention, as well as strong criticism and praise from other anarchists for its activities and [[philosophy]]. CrimethInc. has had a long association with the North American [[anarcho-punk]] scene due to its relationship with notable artists in the genre and its publishing of ''Inside Front'', a seminal genre [[zine]]. It has since expanded into nearly all areas of the contemporary [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] movement.

[[Image:Police Not Welcome.jpg|thumb|"Police Not Welcome" CrimethInc. [[community watch]] sticker.]]
Activities by CrimethInc. cells have included publishing radical literature and music, while less public splinter-groups have carried out [[direct action]], hosted international conventions and other events, maintained local chapters, sparked [[riot]]s and toured with multimedia performance art and/or hardcore [[anarcho-punk]] musical ensembles.

For six summers, CrimethInc. has hosted a convention, extending an invitation to all who wish to attend. Typically featuring the performances of traveling theatrical troupes, musicians, direct-action and mutual-aid workshops from individual participants, the few-days-long camping trip has attracted coverage in newspaper articles,<ref name=gouss/> initiated multiple [[Reclaim the Streets]] actions, mobilized large [[Critical Mass]] actions, and catalyzed many other activities. The 2007 convergence in [[Athens, Ohio]] saw an impromptu [[street party]] which resulted in a few arrests on minor charges.<ref name=gouss>

It is typical of these gatherings to demand that all attendees have something to contribute to the momentum: whether it's bringing food or equipment to share, leading a discussion group, or providing materials with which to write to [[political prisoners]]. There has also been a pattern of promoting convergences as festivals, reminiscent of barnstorming [[flying circus]]es and traveling sideshows.

''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'' journalist Matthew Power described the 2006 convergence in [[Winona, Minnesota]] as follows:
{{bquote|Several hundred young anarchists from around the country had train-hopped and hitchhiked there to attend the annual event known as the CrimethInc Convergence<U+2026>Grimy and feral-looking, the CrimethInc kids squatted in small groups around a clearing.<U+2026>[they] were in the middle of several days of self-organized workshops, seminars, and discussions, ranging from the [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist banking]] theories of the nineteenth-century anarchist philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], to an introductory practicum on [[lock-picking]], to a class on making one<U+2019>s own [[menstrual pad]]s.<U+2026>CrimethInc<U+2019>s adherents had come together there because they wanted to live their lives as some sort of solution.

These convergences have been hosted by different groups within the collective each time, typically based on the initiative of local enthusiasts. Every year a different set of policy requests is released from locals in the field, typically encouraging a sober, consensus-based space in which no financial transactions are made. The one firm rule always made clear has been <U+201C>No police [[informant]]s.<U+201D>, a regulation which has been ignored at least twice by the [[FBI]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa]] in 2004 and in [[Bloomington, Indiana]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thestudentunderground.org/stuff/54/affidavit.pdf |title=Confidential Source <U+201C>Anna<U+201D>-issued affidavit |accessdate=2007-10-31 |format=[[.pdf]] |work=United States District Court Eastern District of California }}</ref>

The group is also connected to other collectives/organizations that share some of their ideas (notably [[Curious George Brigade]] which has written a number of publications including ''[[Anarchy in the Age of Dinosaurs]]'') The group also maintains several websites which promote their ideas. In 2005, they began publishing a half-gloss journal, ''[[Rolling Thunder (zine)|Rolling Thunder]]'', with the byline "An Anarchist Journal of Dangerous Living".

{{main|CrimethInc. Guerilla Film Series, Volume One}}
In March of 2001, two documentaries from Eugene, Oregon's [[Pickaxe Productions]] were published by a CrimethInc. cell: ''[[Pickaxe (film)|Pickaxe]]'' and ''[[Breaking the Spell (film)|Breaking the Spell]]''. 

At the end of 2005 (a year after the release of ''[[Recipes for Disaster]]''), CrimethInc. announced the first volume in a ''Guerrilla Film Series'', a DVD including three feature-length documentaries and a collection of shorts. A few of CrimethInc.'s "[[thinktank]]" experiments had been documented on film by the "folk-scientists" themselves, and copies of these lived in relative obscurity until included in the series. ''CrimethInc. Guerilla Film Series, Volume One'' included ''Pickaxe'', ''Breaking the Spell'', ''The Miami Model'', two [http://submedia.tv subMedia] shorts and three Thinktank documentaries.

=== Music ===
CrimethInc. is associated with the [[North America]]n [[anarcho-punk]] scene because of its long relationship with notable musicians in the genre and its publishing of ''[[Inside Front]]'', a "journal of hardcore punk and anarchist action".<ref name="thompson" /> CrimethInc. has released LPs, CDs, and 7"s from a number of bands, including Aluminum Noise,<ref name="thompson"/> Blacken the Skies, Catharsis,<ref name="thompson">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = Stacy | title = Punk Productions: Unfinished Business | publisher = SUNY Press | location = Albany | pages = 109 | isbn = 0791461874 }}</ref> Countdown to Putsch, Face Down in Shit, Gehenna,<ref name="thompson" /> Newborn, [[Requiem (band)|Requiem]], Sandman, Froseph, The Spectacle, Timebomb,<ref name="thompson" /> [[<U+00DC>mlaut]]<ref name="thompson" /> and [[Zegota (band)|Zegota]].<ref name="thompson" /> Academic Stacy Thompson has situated CrimethInc. as "exemplary of a more contemporary and nuanced approach" to the possible forms [[anarcho-punk]] could take to resist [[commodification]] through aesthetic expression.<ref name="thompson"/> However, Thompson does not consider the aesthetic choices of the collective to be substantially different from the anarcho- and [[crust-punk]] bands released by ''[[Profane Existence]]'' in the mid-to-late 90s.<ref name="thompson"/>

== Reception amongst anarchists ==
Since its inception in the mid-1990s, CrimethInc.'s activities and in particular its philosophy has received a mixed reception from other anarchists. Anarchist anthropologist [[David Graeber]] and Andrej Grubacic lauded the collective in 2004 as "the greatest propagandists of contemporary [[Anarchism in the United States|American anarchism]]".<ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Graeber |authorlink=David Graeber |coauthors=Grubacic, Andrej |title=Anarchism, or the Revolutionary Movement of the Twenty-First Century |url=http://www.dissidentvoice.org/Jan04/Graeber-Grubacic0106.htm |work=[[Dissident Voice]] |date=[[2004-01-06]] |accessdate=2008-02-22 }} </ref> Upon the release of ''[[Expect Resistance]]'' (2007), [[Chuck Munson]] identified the group as "one of the more important anarchist projects happening in North America over the past decade", asserting that in its activities the collective had set the standard for "publishing, organizing, instigating, and activism".<ref>[[Chuck Munson|Munson, Chuck]], "[http://chuck.mahost.org/weblog/?p=1584  New CrimethInc sequel to Days of War due out soon]", [[2007-11-02]]. Retrieved [[2008-02-17]].</ref>

The collectives perceived focus on the "terminal boredom of consumer culture" at the expense of the [[real world]] condition of the [[working class]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Butch |date=[[2002-11-07]] |url=http://www.kersplebedeb.com/mystuff/books/reviews/crimethinc.html |title=Would You Shoplift Days of War, Nights of Love?| work-Kersplebedeb.com |accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref> and its fetishizing "the narcissistic side of the 1960s" (''[[Clamor (magazine)|Clamor]]'')<ref name=brandt/> has lead others in the anarchist movement, such as Libcom.org, to descry the collective as "[[lifestyle anarchism|lifestylists]]".<ref>

[[Red Emma's Bookstore Coffeehouse|Red Emma's]] [[infoshop]] has claimed that regardless of the group's politics, "you have to give them credit for helping revitalizing two very vital traditions of radical writing: on the one hand, they've kicked out enough all-encompassing, no-holds-barred, just barely still prose polemical manifestos to make [[Guy Debord]] proud, on the other hand, they've also produced some stunning personal narratives of living free in the boxcars and margins of [[late capitalism]]."<ref>{{cite web
