The '''Louvre Abu Dhabi''' is a planned [[museum]], to be located in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]]. On Tuesday 7 March 2007, the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]] announced that a new Louvre museum would be completed by 2012 in Abu Dhabi. This is part of a thirty year agreement between the city of Abu Dhabi and the [[French government]]. The museum is to be located on the [[Saadiyat Island]] complex, and will be approximately {{convert|24000|m2|ft2}} in size. The final cost of the construction is expected to be between <U+20AC>83 million and <U+20AC>108 million.

Artwork from around the world will be showcased at the museum, with particular focus placed upon bridging the gap between [[Eastern art|Eastern]] and [[Western art]].

Questions have been raised as to the nature of the artworks to be displayed at the museum.
