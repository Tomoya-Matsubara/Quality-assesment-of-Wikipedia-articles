[[Image:WhiteArmyPropagandaPosterOfTrotsky.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A [[White movement|White]] propaganda poster depicting a demonic [[Leon Trotsky]] wearing a Satanic Star, sitting near a pile of skeletons.  The caption reads "Peace and Freedom in Soviet Russia."]]

'''Jewish Bolshevism''', '''Judeo-Bolshevism''', and '''Judeo-Communism''' is a [[pejorative]] stereotype <ref>Krzysztof Szwagrzyk, <U+017B>ydzi w kierownictwie UB. Stereotyp czy rzeczywisto<U+015B><U+0107>?, Biuletyn IPN (11/2005), p. 37-42</ref> based on the notion that [[Jews]] are the driving force behind the modern [[Communism|Communist]] movement, specifically the Russian [[Bolshevism|Bolsheviks]].

The expression was the title of a pamphlet, ''[[The Jewish Bolshevism]]'', and became current after the [[October Revolution]] (1917) in Russia, featuring prominently in the propaganda of the anti-communist "[[White movement|White]]" forces during the [[Russian Civil War]]. It spread worldwide in the 1920s with the publication and circulation of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''. It made an issue out of the Jewishness of some leading Bolsheviks (most notably [[Leon Trotsky]]) during and after the October Revolution. [[Daniel Pipes]] says that "primarily through ''the Protocols of the Elders of Zion'', the [[White movement|Whites]] spread these charges to an international audience."<ref>[[Daniel Pipes|Pipes, Daniel]] (1997): ''Conspiracy: How the Paranoid Style Flourishes and Where It Comes From'' (The Free Press - Simon & Shuster) p.93. ISBN 0-684-83131-7</ref> [[James Webb (historian)|James Webb]] writes: ''It is rare to find an anti-Semitic source after 1917 which does not stand in debt to the [[White Emigre|White Russian]] analysis of the Revolution."''<ref>[[James Webb (historian)|Webb, James]] (1976): ''Occult Establishment: The Dawn of the New Age and The Occult Establishment'', (Open Court Publishing), p.295. ISBN 0-87548-434-4</ref>

The label "Judeo-Bolshevism" was used in [[Nazi Germany]] to equate Jews with [[communism|communists]], implying that the communist movement served Jewish interests and/or that all Jews were communists.<ref>[[Walter Laqueur|Laqueur, Walter]] (1965): ''Russia and Germany'' (Boston: Little, Brown and Company)</ref>  In Poland before World War II, ''[[<U+017B>ydokomuna]]'' was used in the same way to allege that the Jews were conspiring with the USSR to capture Poland.  The allegation still sees use in antisemitic publications and websites today.

{{main|History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union}}
Jews had been a persecuted minority in the Russian Empire. They had endured a form of [[racial segregation]] in the [[Pale of Settlement]], as well as sporadic [[pogrom]]s. In the period from 1881 to 1920, more than two million Jews left Russia.<ref name="FP_PAE">[http://www.friends-partners.org/partners/beyond-the-pale/english/39.html Political Activity and Emigration.] Beyond the Pale. The History of Jews in Russia. (Exhibition by Friends and Partners Project)</ref> 

According to [[Berel Wein]]: <blockquote>Expulsions, deportations, arrests, and beatings became the daily lot of the Jews, not only of their lower class, but even of the middle class and the Jewish intelligentsia. The government of Alexander III waged a campaign of war against its Jewish [citizens]... The Jews were driven and hounded, and emigration appeared to be the only escape from the terrible tyranny of the [[Romanovs]]."<ref>[[Berel Wein|Wein, Berel]].

Accordingly, Jews in relatively large numbers joined various ideological currents favoring gradual or revolutionary changes within the [[Russian Empire]]. Those movements ranged from the far left ([[Jewish Anarchism|anarchists]],<ref>Goncharok, Moshe. ''Century of Will: Russian Anarchism and Jews (XIX-XX Centuries)''.

The numbers of Jews in important positions continued to shrink in the 1930s when Stalin had his old comrades Kamenev and Zinoviev executed while in prison, after a rigged trial in 1936. 

Zinoviev and Kamenev had previously been expelled, in October 1927 and December 1927 respectively, from the top positions they shared with Stalin in the Soviet ruling elite. Leon Trotsky had concurrently been expelled from the Soviet Union in 1927 and was then assassinated in [[Mexico City]] in 1940, by a Soviet agent, the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[Spanish people|Spaniard]] [[Ram<U+00F3>n Mercader]]. 

By 1940, and after his [[Molotov<U+2013>Ribbentrop Pact|rapprochement with Hitler's Germany]], Stalin had eliminated virtually all Jews from very high level government positions inside the Soviet Union.

[[Walter Laqueur]] states in his book ''The Changing Face of Antisemitism: From Ancient Times to the Present Day'':
<blockquote>To what extent did the presence of many Jews among the Communist leadership contribute to antisemitism? It certainly played an important role in antisemitic propaganda, and it is certainly true that during the 1920s Jews were heavily overrepresented in the ranks of party and state officials. With the rise of Stalin, Jews were removed from key positions and very often "liquidated." The fact that other minorities were also disproportionately highly represented did not greatly matter - there was no tradition of anti-Latvianism in Russia, nor were Latvians found in the very top positions. Nor did it matter that Jews were equally strongly represented among other anti-Communist parties of the left such as the Mensheviks and the Social Revolutionaries, or that the anti-Stalinist opposition was to a considerable extent of Jewish extraction.<ref name=laqueur>[[Walter Laqueur]].

<blockquote>"Antisemites... refused to acknowledge the important and indisputable fact that the Jews who participated in the Socialist and Anarchist movements around the world, including the Russian Jews in particular, were renegades of the Jewish nation who had no connection with Jewish history nor with Jewish religion nor with Jewish masses, but were rather exclusively [[internationalist]]s, promoting the ideas shared by Socialists of other ethnicities, and were hostile to the Jewish nation in general."<ref>{{ru icon}} [http://jhistory.nfurman.com/lessons10/bur_protokoly13.htm ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Proved Forgery''] (Ch. 3) by [[Vladimir Burtsev]]</ref>

[[Walter Laqueur]], in ''Russia and Germany, A Century of Conflict'', traces this conspiracy theory to Nazi ideologue and [[Baltic German]], [[Alfred Rosenberg]]:

{{quote|Rosenberg's ''[[obiter dicta]] about Russia and Communism are found in the ''[[Myth of the Twentieth Century|Mythos]]'' and in countless brochures and booklets: Bolshevism is the revolt of the Jewish, Slavic and [[Mongoloid|Mongolian]] [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] against the Germans ([[Aryan]]) element in Russia; it is the revolt of the [[steppe]], the hatred of the nomads of everything great, heroic, racially healthy; all big things in Russian history had been achieved by Germans or those of German blood, but the [[revolution of 1917]] had exterminated the Aryan element. . . ., nor did the Jewish-Soviet Government represent the Russian people. To the Nazi ideologists, all leading Soviet statesmen were Jews: [[Lenin]] and [[Trotsky]], [[Lunacharsky]] and [[Rakovsky]], [[Valerian Kuybyshev|Kuibyshev]] and [[Leonid Krasin|Krasin]], [[Lazar Kaganovich|Kaganovitch]] and [[Dmitry Manuilsky|Manuilsky]] among them. Whoever was not a Jew was a Chinese. Rosenberg developed an elaborate theory about the leading role of Chinese silk merchants in the Russian revolution. While other observers of the Soviet scene engaged in political speculation and social analysis, the Nazis' Russian experts were preoccupied with another kind of scientific investigation which hardly left them time for anything else. They tracked down the 'real' (Jewish) names of all Soviet leaders; Lunacharsky, for instance, became [[Mondschein]] - for who did not know that '[[luna]]' was 'moon' in Latin? This, by and large, was the level of Nazi [[Sovietology]].|Laqueur|''Ibid.'', pp. 21-22}}

In [[Nazi Germany]], this term expressed the common perception that Communism was a Jewish-inspired and Jewish-led movement seeking world domination from its very origin. The term was popularized in print by German journalist [[Dietrich Eckhart]], who authored the pamphlet "''Der Bolschewismus von Moses bis Lenin''" ("Bolshevism from Moses to Lenin") in the early 1920s, thereby tying [[Moses]] and Lenin as both Communists and Jews. [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s 1923 edition of the ''Protocols'' "gave a forgery a huge boost".<ref name=DPipes_p95>[[Daniel Pipes]] (1997): ''Conspiracy: How the Paranoid Style Flourishes and Where It Comes From'' (The Free Press - Simon & Shuster) p.95. ISBN 0-684-83131-7</ref> This was followed by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s highly inflammatory statement in ''Mein Kampf'' (1924): "In Russian Bolshevism we must see Jewry's twentieth century effort to take world dominion unto itself."

According to Michael Kellogg, the author of ''The Russian Roots of Nazism. White <U+00C9>migr<U+00E9>s and the Making of National Socialism, 1917<U+2013>1945'':
<blockquote>In his groundbreaking 1939 book, ''L<U+2019>Apocalypse de notre temps: Les dessous de la propagande allemande d<U+2019>apr<U+00E8>s des documents in<U+00E9>dits'' (The Apocalypse of Our Times: The Hidden Side of German Propaganda According to Unpublished Documents), Henri Rollin stressed that "Hitlerism" represented a form of "anti-Soviet counter-revolution" which employed the "myth of a mysterious Jewish-Masonic-Bolshevik plot." Rollin investigated the National Socialist belief, which was taken primarily from White <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9> views, that a vast Jewish-Masonic conspiracy had provoked World War <U+2160>, toppled the Russian, German, and Austro-Hungarian Empires, and unleashed Bolshevism after undermining the existing order through the insidious spread of liberal ideas. German forces promptly destroyed Rollin<U+2019>s work in 1940 after they occupied France, and the book has remained in obscurity ever since.<ref>[http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780511079498&ss=exc The Russian Roots of Nazism.

Montgomery Schuyler, a military intelligence officer in Russia, reported regularly to the chief of staff of [[U.S. Army]] Intelligence, who relayed the reports to the US president. In one of these reports, declassified in 1958, Schuyler states: "It is probably unwise to say this loudly in the United States, but the Bolshevik movement is and has been since its beginning, guided and controlled by Russian Jews of the greasiest type..."<ref name="schuyler">U.S. National Archives. Record group 120: Records of the American Expeditionary Forces, June 9, 1919.</ref> In another report on June 9, 1919, Schuyler wrote the following, which the historical record shows to be inaccurate:{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
<blockquote>''A table made up in 1918, by [[Robert Wilton]], correspondent of the ''[[The Times|London Times]]'' in Russia, shows at that time there were 384 commissars including 2 [[Negro]]es, 13 Russians, 15 [[China]]men, 22 [[Armenians]] and more than 300 Jews. Of the latter number, 264 had come from the United States since the downfall of the Imperial Government.''<ref name="schuyler" /></blockquote>

[[Lucien Wolf]], one of the voices of the period who took issue with the propagation of the Jewish Bolshevism conspiracy and the [[Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]] hoax concurrently being spread in the West, writes in ''The Myth of the Jewish Menace in World Affairs'' (1921):<blockquote>"...I find a notorious German anti-Semitic book quoting... Wilton, of the ''Times'', as its authority for the statement that 'of 384 People's Commissars who constitute the Government only 13 are Russians, while 300 are Jews.' What are the facts? The only officials in Soviet Russia who are authorised to hold the rank of People's Commissars are the members of the Cabinet. These number 17, and of them 16 are indisputably Gentiles, while only one{{ndash}}Trotsky{{ndash}}is Jewish by birth... The other so-called Jewish Commissars are all men of the second and lower ranks of officials belonging exclusively either to the Civil Service or the Soviet analogue of our municipal life. They are probably fairly numerous, but in what may be called the second rank they do not number more than ten at the outside. The others may or may not be convinced Bolsheviks. They are servants of the State who may have many other motives for serving the Soviets than an enthusiasm for Lenin's politics...Trotsky has in his War Office and Corps of Officers probably as many ex-Tsarist officers{{ndash}}including sixteen Generals{{ndash}}as there are 'Jewish Commissars' in the whole Soviet Administration. And yet nobody dreams of describing the Red Legions as a Tsarist Army. These officers are probably not even Bolsheviks. If we could know their motives we should probably find that they were not very widely different from those which actuate the 'Jewish Commissars.'</blockquote><blockquote>"All this is not to say that there are no professing Jews in the Bolshevist ranks, or that the number of indifferent and apostate Jews who have thrown in their lot with the Soviets is quite negligible. What is contended is that normally the Jew is intensely antipathetic to Bolshevism, and that at the beginning of the Revolution relatively very few Jews{{ndash}}even of those who were Jews by race only{{ndash}}rallied to the call of Lenin. That this situation has changed during the last year is not improbable. But with whom does the blame rest? If Jews have reluctantly turned toward Bolshevism, it is because they have been forced into it by the anti-Bolsheviks. They cannot but be alarmed by the persistancy and passion with which the charge of Bolshevism is levelled against them, and the threats which come from all sides to avenge in their persons the sins of Lenin and Trotsky."<ref>[[Lucien Wolf|Wolf, Lucien]].

In an article in the ''Illustrated Sunday Herald'' on February 8 1920, [[Winston Churchill]] asserted::
<blockquote>''There is no need to exaggerate the part played in the creation of Bolshevism and in the actual bringing about of the Russian Revolution by these international and for the most part atheistic Jews. It is certainly a very great one; it probably outweighs all others. With the notable exception of Lenin, the majority of the leading figures are Jews.''<ref name=DPipes_p95/><ref>[[Winston Churchill|Churchill, Winston]].

Such attitudes were not uncommon in the UK at the  time of the [[allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]]. The British court of inquiry, appointed to investigate the Arab [[1920 Palestine riots]], associated [[Zionism]] with Bolshevism and identified the Jewish nationalist leader [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] with a [[Labor Zionism|Labor Zionist]] party, [[Poale Zion]], which the court called "a definite Bolshevist institution."<ref name=Segev>[[Tom Segev|Segev, Tom]], ''One Palestine, Complete'', Metropolitan Books, 1999. p.141</ref> In reality, Jabotinsky was a staunch anti-socialist<ref name=Segev/> who had fought with the [[Jewish Legion]] of the British Army in [[World War I]] and was already emerging as a leader of the right-wing [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist Zionist]] opposition to the [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionist]] movement.<ref>[[Yaacov Shavit|Shavit, Yaacov]].
