'''Hugh Leonard Thompson Murphy''', who commonly went by the name Lenny (or Lennie) Murphy (2 March 1952, died 16 November 1982), was a [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] [[paramilitary]] from [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]]. Murphy was a member of the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) and leader of the infamous [[Shankill Butchers]]. Although never convicted of [[murder]], Murphy is thought to have killed a number of people and to have ordered the deaths of many more.<ref name="McKittrick">[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/exposure-sealed-fate-of-notorious-activists-710345.html] "Exposure sealed fate of notorious activists", ''The Independent'', 24 August 2000</ref> Murphy spent long periods in custody from October 1972 to July 1982, being free for only ten months during that time.

A Protestant, Murphy had a fanatical hatred of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]. In his book ''The Shankill Butchers'', Belfast journalist [[Martin Dillon]] suggests that Murphy's visceral loathing of Catholics may have stemmed from his own family being suspected of having recent Catholic ancestry, because of his traditionally Irish surname which is more often associated with the other side of the religious divide in Northern Ireland.<ref name="early life">Dillon, ''Shankill Butchers, pp 4-9</ref> After his death in 1982, his mother commented: "I don't honestly believe he was a bad man"; however, that very day an unnamed loyalist paramilitary leader from the [[Ulster Defence Association|UDA]] described Murphy as a "typical psychopath".<ref name=psychopath> ''News Letter'', November 18, 1982</ref>

==Early life==
Lenny Murphy was the youngest of three sons of Joyce and William Murphy from the loyalist [[Shankill Road]], Belfast. While the family moved house several times, in 1957 they returned to the lower Shankill, living at 28 Percy Street. Prior to the erection of a [[Peace lines|peace wall]] in 1970s, Percy Street ran from the lower Shankill area to the [[Falls Road, Belfast|Falls Road]]. A hoodlum at school (Argyle Primary), where he was known for the use of a knife and had his elder brothers to back him up, Murphy logged his first conviction at the age of twelve for theft. After leaving the [[Belfast Boys' Model School]] at sixteen, he joined the UVF and was involved in the [[1969 Northern Ireland riots|rioting]] that plagued Belfast in August 1969.

==First crimes==
Dillon states that Murphy was involved in the torture and murder of four Catholic men as early as 1972. On 28 September of that year, a man named William Edward Pavis was shot dead at his home in East Belfast by loyalists because he was alleged to have sold firearms to the IRA. Murphy was arrested for this crime along with an accomplice, Mervyn Connor.

During pre-trial investigations, Murphy was placed in a line-up for possible identification by witnesses to Pavis' shooting. Before the process began formally, he created a disturbance and stepped out of the line-up. However, two witnesses picked him out when order was restored.

Connor and Murphy were held in prison together but, in April 1973, before the trial, Connor died after ingesting [[cyanide]] in his cell. He had written a [[suicide note]] in which he confessed to the crime and exonerated Murphy, who had forced Connor to write the note before being forcibly fed the cyanide. Murphy was sent to trial for the murder of Pavis in June 1973. Although two witnesses identified him as the gunman, he was acquitted by the jury on the basis that their evidence may have been affected by the disturbance during the police line-up inquiry. However Murphy was re-arrested and jailed for attempted escapes.<ref name="pavis">Dillon and Lehane, ''Political Murder in Northern Ireland'' (1973), pp 125-27</ref>

By May 1975 Murphy, now twenty-three, was back on the streets of Belfast. He was married with a daughter (he was to father six children in all){{fact|date=December 2008}} but spent much of his time drinking in Shankill bars. At that time his family had moved to Brookmount Street, towards the top of the Shankill. With his brother William he soon formed a gang of more than twenty men that would become known as the Shankill Butchers, one of his lieutenants being [[William Moore (loyalist)|William Moore]].[[File:Brookmountstreet.jpg|thumb|300px|right|<center>Brookmount St (2009)</center>]]

The gang killed four Catholics during a robbery in October 1975. Over the next few months Murphy and his accomplices began to abduct, torture and murder random Catholics they dragged off the streets late at night. According to Dillon Murphy hacked each victim's throat open with a butcher's knife. They killed three Catholic men in this manner.<ref name="cut-throat">Dillon, ''Shankill Butchers'', pp 66-69, 115-31</ref> None of the victims had any connection to the IRA or any other republican group. 

The Butchers were also involved in the murder of Noel Shaw, a loyalist from a rival UVF unit, who had shot dead Butcher gang-member Archie Waller in Downing Street, off the Shankill Road, in November 1975. Four days before his death, Waller had been involved in the abduction and murder of the Butchers' first victim, Francis Crossen. One day after Waller's death, Shaw was beaten and pistol-whipped by Murphy while strapped to a chair, then shot. His body was later dumped in a back street off the Shankill.<ref name=Waller">Jordan, ''Milestones in Murder'' (centre pages with image of Shaw's body in basket)</ref>

On 10 January 1976, Murphy and Moore killed a Catholic man, Edward McQuaid (25), on the Cliftonville Road. Murphy, alighting from Moore's taxi in the small hours, shot the man six times at close range.

==Imprisonment==
Early on 11 March 1976, Murphy shot and injured a young Catholic woman, once again on the Cliftonville. Arrested the next day after attempting to retrieve the gun used, Murphy was charged with attempted murder and remanded in custody for a prolonged period. However, he was able to [[plea bargain]] whereby he was allowed to plead guilty to the lesser charge of a firearms offence, and received twelve years' imprisonment on 11 October 1977. Dillon notes that the police believed Murphy was involved in the Shankill Butcher murders. After his conviction, therefore, he relayed orders from prison through his brothers: to divert suspicion from him, the rest of the gang was to continue the cut-throat murders.

The Butchers, now under the operational command of William Moore, went on to kill and mutilate at least three more Catholics before they were arrested in May 1977 and, in February 1979, imprisoned for long periods. Many confessed to their crimes; however, although they named Murphy as the godfather, they retracted those parts of their statements in fear of Murphy and his brothers. Murphy was questioned once again about the Butcher murders but refused to co-operate.

The total of sentences handed down to the gang at Belfast [[Crown Court]] was the longest in legal history in the United Kingdom.

==Death==
On completing his sentence for the firearms charge, Lenny Murphy walked out of the [[Maze (HM Prison)|Maze prison]] on Friday, 16 July 1982. During his term inside, he had kept his head down and acted as a model prisoner to ensure he was freed as early as possible. His wife had also initiated divorce proceedings and the divorce was being finalised at the time of his death.

After his release, Murphy killed at least three more people over the next four months, including a partly-disabled man beaten to death the day after Murphy's return to the Shankill.

On 16 November 1982, Murphy had just pulled up outside the rear of his girlfriend's house in the Glencairn area of the upper Shankill when two [[Provisional IRA]] gunmen emerged from a black van nearby and opened fire with an assault rifle and a 9&nbsp;mm pistol. Murphy was hit by more than twenty rounds and died instantly. Coincidentally, he was gunned down just around the corner from where the bodies of many of the Butchers' victims had been dumped. A few days after his death the IRA claimed responsibility. According to [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] reports, the UVF had provided the IRA hit team with the details of Murphy's habits and movements, which allowed them to assassinate him at that particular location. Another line of inquiry ends at [[Ulster Freedom Fighters|UFF]] commander James Craig, who saw Murphy as a serious threat to his widespread racketeering and provided the IRA with key information on Murphy's movements. Craig was later executed by his comrades for "treason".<ref name="assassination"> Dillon, pp 312-16</ref>

Murphy was given a large paramilitary funeral by the UVF.
