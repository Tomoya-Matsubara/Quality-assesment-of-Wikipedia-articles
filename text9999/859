'''Thomas Nagel''' (born 1937) is an American philosopher, currently [[University Professor]] and [[Professor]] of [[Philosophy]] and [[Law]] at [[New York University]].  His main areas of philosophical interest are [[philosophy of mind]], [[political philosophy]], [[ethics]].  He is widely known for his critique of reductionist accounts of the mind in his essay "What Is it Like to Be a Bat?" (1974).  However, he is also well known for his contributions to ethical, political, and social issues.  For example, in ''The Possibility of Altruism'' (1970), Nagel defends [[altruism]]&mdash;the view that people can commit acts that benefit another without the expectation of benefit for oneself&mdash;against rival views, such as [[egoism]]. 

==Biography==
{{section-stub}}
Thomas Nagel was born July 4, 1937 in [[Belgrade]], [[Yugoslavia]] (now [[Serbia]]); his family was [[Jewish]]. He received a [[Bachelor degree]] from [[Cornell University]] in 1958, a [[BPhil]] from [[Oxford University]] in [[1960]], and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1963 under the supervision of [[John Rawls]]. Before settling in New York, Nagel taught briefly at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (from 1963 to 1966) and at [[Princeton University]] (from 1966 to 1980).  In 2006, he was made a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]].<ref>Biographical information from [http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/nagel/nagelcv.pdf Nagel's CV at NYU (PDF)].</ref>

Throughout his career, Nagel has received several awards and recognitions.  To name a few, he is a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and a Fellow of the [[British Academy]], and has held fellowships from the [[Guggenheim Foundation]], the [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].<ref>From [http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/nagel/ Nagel's faculty page at New York University].</ref>

==Work==
{{section-stub}}
Much of Nagel's work concerns the tension between objective and subjective perspectives:  on reasons for action, on agency, on experience, and on reality as a whole.  He is known within the field of [[philosophy of mind]] as an advocate of the idea that [[consciousness]] and [[subjective]] experience cannot be reduced to [[brain]] activity.  Along with [[Bernard Williams]], he has also contributed much to the early development of the problem of [[moral luck]], detailing its various aspects, and analyzing its impact on ethics and moral evaluation. For many years, Nagel has conducted a [[seminar]] noted for an array of guest speakers with his colleague [[Ronald Dworkin]].

===Philosophy of mind===
One of Nagel's most famous articles is "What is it Like to Be a Bat?".  The article's title question, though often attributed to Nagel, was originally posed by [[Timothy L.S. Sprigge]]. The article was originally published in [[1974]] in ''[[The Philosophical Review]]''.  However, the essay has been reprinted in several books that are concerned with [[consciousness]] and the [[mind]], such as ''[[The Mind's I]]'' (edited by [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Douglas Hofstadter]]), ''Readings in the Philosophy of Psychology'' (edited by Ned Block), and Nagel's ''Mortal Questions'' (1979).

In "What is it Like to Be a Bat?", Nagel argues that [[consciousness]] has essential to it a ''subjective character'', a ''what it is like'' aspect.  He states that "an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is to ''be'' that organism&mdash;something it is like ''for'' the organism."<ref>Nagel, "What is it Like to Be a Bat?" (1974), p. 436.</ref>  Nagel also alludes to the idea that the subjective aspect of the mind cannot ever be sufficiently accounted for by the [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] methods of [[reductionism|reductionistic]] science.  He claims that "[i]f we acknowledge that a physical theory of mind must account for the subjective character of experience, we must admit that no presently available conception gives us a clue how this could be done."<ref>Ibid., p. 445.</ref>  Furthermore, he states that "it seems unlikely that any physical theory of mind can be contemplated until more thought has been given to the general problem of subjective and objective."<ref>Ibid., p. 450.</ref> 

While Nagel is sometimes categorized as a [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] for these sorts of remarks, he is more precisely categorized as an anti-reductionist. Nagel (1998) writes:

{{cquote|...I believe that there is a necessary connection in both directions between the physical and the mental, but that it cannot be discovered a priori. Opinion is strongly divided on the credibility of some kind of functionalist reductionism, and I won't go through my reasons for being on the antireductionist side of that debate. Despite significant attempts by a number of philosophers to describe the functional manifestations of conscious mental states, I continue to believe that no purely functionalist characterization of a system entails&mdash;simply in virtue of our mental concepts&mdash;that the system is conscious.<ref>Nagel, "Conceiving the Impossible and the Mind-Body Problem" (1998), p. 337.</ref>}}
