'''Wilhelm von Urenbach''' was chosen as the [[Grand Masters of the Teutonic Knights|Grand Master]] of the [[Teutonic Order]] in 1253 in opposition to Grand Master [[Poppo von Osterna]], elected by the majority of the knights. He is considered a [[pretender]] to the title, as he was chosen by the pro-[[papacy|papal]] [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] minority party.

Close co-operation of the Order with Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] and his successors from the [[House of Hohenstaufen]] caused a conflict with [[Pope Innocent IV]].
Previous Grand Masters [[Heinrich von Hohenlohe]] and [[G<U+00FC>nther von W<U+00FC>llersleben]] were keen allies of the pro-imperial [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibelline]] party. The tense situation threatened the dissolution and [[excommunication]] of the Order by the pope and caused a large number of the Teutonic Knights to turn against the excommunicated emperor, Frederick II.

The pro-papal alliance was led by [[Dietrich von Gr<U+00FC>ningen]], the Master of the [[Livonian Order]].
The internal conflict was clearly seen during the meetings of the Order's [[:wikt:capitulum|capitulum]] to choose a new Grand Master in 1252.  The majority supported [[Poppo von Osterna]], but the minority, the opponents of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, chose Wilhelm von Urenbach as their own Grand Master.

Von Urenbach resided in [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]. Little know about him except for one document, a border agreement issued in 1253 between the Teutonic Order and the Bishop of [[Courland]], [[Heinrich von Luxemburg]]. In 1256 von Urenbach renounced his claim and submitted to Poppo von Osterna's successor, Grand Master [[Hanno von Sangershausen]].
