==World War I==
Payton joined the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] in November 1917. After training, he was posted to 10 Naval Squadron on 31 March 1918. He awoke the next morning in the brand new Royal Air Force.<ref name="Franks, p. 47">Franks, p. 47.</ref>
 
Payton served as a [[Sopwith Camel]] fighter pilot in France. His first success came on 20 May 1918, when he drove down a German [[Albatros D.V]] fighter plane out of control over [[Menen]], Belgium. The next day, he teamed with squadronmates [[Solomon Clifford Joseph]] and Albert Leslie Jones to destroy a German [[observation balloon]] at Pont Riquen. On 26 May, another Albatros D.V fell under his guns. The following day, he teamed with [[Lawrence Coombes (aviator)|Lawrence Coombes]] in driving down a [[Pfalz D.III]] fighter over [[Bailleul, Nord|Bailleul]].<ref name=payton>[http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/england/payton.php Payton], theaerodrome.com, Retrieved 22 April 2011.</ref> 

On 1 June 1918, he again teamed with Coombes; this time, they shared in the destruction of a German two-seater reconnaissance plane, and Payton joined Coombes in acedom. On 15 June, Payton drove down an Albatros D.V out of action.<ref name=payton/>

Payton did not score again until 11 August 1918, when he began a string of five destructions of the German's new fighter, the [[Fokker D.VII]], including a shared win with Ivan Couper Sanderson. The last of these wins, on 1 October 1918, left Payton with a tally of a shared destruction of a balloon, shared victory in two destructions of enemy planes, solo destructions of five enemy fighters, and three enemy planes driven down out of control.<ref name=payton/>

Clement Wattson Payton was [[killed in action]] on 2 October 1918 after winning the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].

==Legacy==
His Distinguished Flying Cross was gazetted two months after his death, on 3 December 1918: "A gallant and skilful pilot who has himself destroyed two enemy machines and driven down two out of control. Assisted by other pilots, he has also accounted for four others. On 23 August, in a bombing raid, one of our machines, compelled to descend owing to engine trouble, was heavily engaged by anti-aircraft fire. Observing this, Lt. Payton, with great courage, attacked the hostile batteries at a very low altitude, silencing several of them.<ref>(''Supplement to the London Gazette,'' 3 December 1918) http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/31046/supplements/14324 Retrieved 21 April 2011.</ref>
