'''Junior Jones''' (born December 19, 1970 in [[Image:Flag of the United States.svg|20px]] [[Brooklyn, NY|Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], [[New York]]) was a professional boxer.  Known as "Poison", Jones was an exciting [[Bantamweight]] fighter, who is best remembered for his two victories over [[Mexico|Mexican]] boxing legend [[Marco Antonio Barrera]].

== Amateur career ==
Jones won two New York [[Golden Gloves]] Championships, the 1988 119lb Novice Championship and the 1989 119lb Open Championship. In 1988 Jones defeated Arnold Miranda of the Cage Recreation in the finals to win the Championship and in 1989 Jones defeated Robert Pimentel of the New York City Recreation in the finals to win the Championship. Jones trained at the Police Athletic League. In the Olympic box-offs he lost to eventual Gold medallist [[Kennedy McKinney]].
His record was 150-9.

== Professional career ==
Jones began his career in 1989 and ran off a string of 32 consecutive victories, capturing the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Bantamweight title on 23 October 1993 with a win over [[Jorge Julio Rocha]].  On 22 April 1994, Jones lost his title to [[John Michael Johnson]] by a TKO in the eleventh round.

Jones faded into obscurity for the next two years prior to taking on the undefeated  Barrera for the [[World Boxing Organisation|WBO]] [[Super bantamweight]] title on 22 November 1996.  He was the first man to beat Barrera, knocking the Mexican superstar out in the fifth round.  Barrera's corner-men entered the ring, which disqualifed Barrera before he could be stopped. In the rematch, Jones won a unanimous decision against Barrera, although some fans disputed the verdict. After winning the two fights over Barrera, Jones lost his belt to 1998 [[1988 Summer Olympics|Olympic]] [[List of Olympic medalists in boxing|Gold Medal]] winner [[Kennedy McKinney]].  Following the loss to McKinney, Jones took on WBC Super bantamweight title holder [[Erik Morales]], losing by a TKO in the fourth round.  The loss to Morales was the beginning of the end for Jones, who went on to win against [[Tracy Harris Patterson]] and [[Tom Johnson (boxer)|Tom Johnson]] before losing to [[Paul Ingle]] before hanging up his gloves in 2002.
