==History==
The magazine was first published in 1994 as the ''Tokyo Classified''. Early editions, in the broadsheet style, consisted of classified advertisements sourced from shop notice boards.<ref>{{cite web | first=Billy | last=Adams | url=http://www.markdevlin.com/Articles/businessam/businessam.htm | title=Big in Japan | accessdate=2007-04-28 | publisher=Business A.M | date=2002-12-11}}</ref> Initially distributed with the ''[[Daily Yomiuri]]'', the company created an independent distribution network after the newspaper censored advertisements it found objectionable. The magazine is distributed to companies, embassies, hotels, bars, and restaurants.<ref>{{cite web | author=Jonathon Walsh | url=http://www.ea-tokyo.com/seminars/seminarsummaries/20040907.php | title=Life in the Metropolis: Mark Devlin, CEO & Publisher, Crisscross K.K. | publisher=Entrepreneur Association of Tokyo | date=2004-09-07 | accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref>  The magazine was originally owned and operated by Mark and Mary Devlin.  It was renamed ''Metropolis'' in 2001.<ref name="Gianni" />

Since 1999 the magazine hosted an annual Halloween party "Glitterball" at [[Roppongi|Roppongi's]] [[Velfarre]] club. Since 2003, ''Metropolis'' has donated some of the profits each year to the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation]] of Japan and the [[YMCA]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Karen Foster | title=A Good Cause | url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20060307zg.html | work=The Japan Times | accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref>
