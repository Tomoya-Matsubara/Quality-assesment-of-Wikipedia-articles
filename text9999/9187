'''Balsam Mountain''' is one of the [[Catskill High Peaks|High Peaks]] of the [[Catskill Mountains]] in the U.S. state of [[New York]]. Its exact height has not been determined, so the highest [[contour line]], {{convert|3600|ft|m}}, is usually given as its elevation. It is located in western [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]], on the [[drainage divide|divide]] between the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] and [[Delaware River|Delaware]] [[Drainage basin|watersheds]]. The summit and western slopes of the peak are within the Town of [[Hardenburgh, New York|Hardenburgh]] and its eastern slopes are in [[Shandaken, New York|Shandaken]]. The small community of [[Oliverea, New York|Oliverea]] is near its base on that side. Most of the mountain is publicly owned, managed by the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] as part of the state [[Forest Preserve (New York)|Forest Preserve]], part of the [[Big Indian-Beaverkill Range Wilderness Area]] in the [[Catskill Park]]. The summit is on a small corner of private land.

As one of the High Peaks it is a popular destination for [[hiking|hikers]], especially [[peak bagging|peakbaggers]] seeking membership in the [[Catskill Mountain 3500 Club]], since along with [[Slide Mountain (Ulster County, New York)|Slide]], [[Panther Mountain (New York)|Panther]] and [[Blackhead Mountain|Blackhead]] it is one of four peaks that members must climb twice, at least once in winter. The [[Pine Hill-West Branch Trail]] (PHWB) crosses its summit; hikers usually approach from either side via the [[Oliverea-Mapledale Trail]], which intersects the PHWB south of the summit, and make the ascent from there. The northwestern approach makes a loop route possible via the [[Mine Hollow Trail]]; the southeastern ascent, from McKenley Hollow, has the steepest stretch of trail on any ascent of a Catskill High Peak.<ref name="3500 Club page">{{cite web|title=Balsam Mountain 3600'|url=http://www.catskill-3500-club.org/catskill-peaks/balsam-mountain.htm|publisher=[[Catskill Mountain 3500 Club]]|date=2007<U+2013>2010|accessdate=March 2, 2010}}</ref>

==Geography==

Balsam Mountain is one of several peaks on an officially unnamed range that carries the watershed divide to [[Winnisook Lake]] near Slide Mountain. It is the second northernmost peak on the range after [[Belleayre Ski Center|Belleayre Mountain]], and the northernmost to exceed {{convert|3500|ft|m}}, the threshold for inclusion as a High Peak. A ridge almost two miles (3.2&nbsp;km) in length separates it and Belleayre. South of Balsam the ridge turns to the southwest, connecting it to {{convert|3420|ft|m|adj=on}} Haynes Mountain after a mile (1.6&nbsp;km). The [[summit (topography)|summit]], a small bump, is at the south end of a narrow ridge {{convert|2000|ft|m}} in length with a slight dip between it and the false summit on the northern end.<ref name="Shandaken USGS quad">{{cite map |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |title=Shandaken Quadrangle - New York - Ulster County |url=http://www.topoquest.com/map.php?lat=42.09119&lon=-74.48814&datum=nad83&zoom=8&map=auto&coord=d&mode=zoomout&size=m |edition= |year=1940 |cartography= |scale=1:24,000 |series=7<U+00BD> Minute Series (Topographic) |page= |section= |inset= |accessdate=March 1, 2010 |isbn=}}</ref>

Winding red and blue lines intersect below the summit, and a short yellow line connects them in the upper left quadrant]]
On its east the slopes drop generally steeply down to Big Indian Hollow, the valley of the headwaters of [[Esopus Creek]], around {{convert|1200|ft|m}} above sea level. There some more gently sloped areas at mid-mountain level, around {{convert|2200|to|2700|ft|m}}, on the southeast side. [[Tributary|Tributaries]] and subtributaries of the Esopus drain even steeper valleys radiating out in a fan-shaped pattern from Lost Clove at the northeast to McKenley (also McKinley) Hollow in the southeast.<ref name="Shandaken USGS quad" />

The valleys on the west side are also steep but not as numerous, and converge at a higher elevation, {{convert|2100|ft|m}} than the base on the eastern side. A narrow valley carries the combined streams down to Dry Brook, a tributary of the [[East Branch Delaware River|East Branch]] of the [[Delaware River]]. The northernmost valley, Mine Hollow, is the only one with an official name,<ref name="Seager USGS quad">{{cite map |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |title=Seager Quadrangle - New York - Delaware and Ulster Counties |url=http://www.topoquest.com/map.php?lat=42.09150&lon=-74.50023&datum=nad83&zoom=4&map=auto&coord=d&mode=pan&size=m |edition= |year=1940 |cartography= |scale=1:24,000 |series=7<U+00BD> Minute Series (Topographic) |page= |section= |inset= |accessdate=March 1, 2010 |isbn=}}</ref> the result of a failed attempt to mine gold believed to be in the area.<ref name="Old ADK guide">{{cite book |title=Guide to Catskill Trails |last=Wadsworth |first=Bruce |authorlink= |coauthors=members of the [[Adirondack Mountain Club]] [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] chapter |year=1988|edition=2nd, with revisions |publisher=[[Adirondack Mountain Club]] |location=[[Lake George (village), New York|Lake George, NY]] |isbn=0935272712|page=201|quote=At one time there was thought to be gold in this hollow, but a mine yielded none.}}</ref> The larger valley it forks off from is known informally as Rider Hollow.

==Geology==

Like the Catskills as a whole, a [[dissected plateau]], Balsam was formed not through the [[tectonic uplift|uplift]] of rock layers but by the gradual erosion of stream valleys in an uplifted region about 350 [[mya (unit)|mya]]. Its rock layers and bedrock are primarily [[Devonian]] and [[Silurian]] [[shale]] and [[sandstone]].<ref name="Titus book">{{cite book |title=The Catskills: A Geological Guide |last=Titus |first=Robert |year=1993 |publisher=Purple Mountain Press |location=[[Fleischmanns, New York|Fleischmanns, NY]] |isbn=0935796041 |pages=22<U+2013>34}}</ref> Later [[glaciation]], primarily the [[Illinoian (stage)|Illinois]] and [[Last glacial period#Wisconsin glaciation, in North America|Wisconsin]] periods, shaped the slopes of the mountain, making them even steeper and gradually forming Esopus Creek from its [[meltwater]].

The steeper slopes and deeper valley on the east side reflect the unusual [[orogeny]] of the Esopus and [[Panther Mountain (New York)|Panther Mountain]] to the east. The rocks of the stream are fractured and faulted much more than elsewhere in the Catskills, and it and its tributary [[Woodland Creek]] make an almost complete circle around the mountain, a rosette pattern similarly unusual in the region. Yngvar Isachsen of the New York State Geological Survey has found evidence strongly suggesting that the entire Panther Mountain region is the [[Inverted relief|inverse]] form of a [[impact crater|crater]] that formed after an ancient [[meteor impact]] when the Catskills were a [[river delta]] at the northeastern corner of the [[Inland sea (geology)|inland sea]] that is now the [[Allegheny Plateau]]. The rims of the crater wall were thus more prone to erosion and created a deeper valley for the eventual headwaters of the Esopus.<ref name="Discover">Guterl, Fred; August 2000; [http://discovermagazine.com/2000/aug/featcrater/ The Panther Mountain Crater]; ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]''; retrieved March 1, 2010.</ref>

==Flora and fauna==

Balsam's slopes are covered with typical forestatiion for their elevations in the Catskills. [[Northern hardwood forest|Northern hardwoods]], primarily [[beech]], [[birch]] and [[maple]] species, predominate, with some occasional [[cherry]] and [[Sorbus|mountain ash]].<ref name="Kudish31<U+2013>33">Kudish, 31<U+2013>33.</ref> Southern species such as oaks, isolated [[American chestnut]]s that survived the [[chestnut blight|blight]], [[shagbark hickory]] and [[dogwood]]s are located close to streams near the base.<ref name="Kudish36<U+2013>37">Kudish, 36<U+2013>37.</ref> The northern hardwood species become more stunted and dwarfed at higher elevations, more so on the ridges. On the mountain's summit, [[boreal forest|boreal]] species such as [[balsam fir]] and [[red spruce]] make an appearance, forming some small stands but not a continuous cover as is seen on higher peaks in the range. Around 1970, Catskill forest historian [[Michael Kudish]] found the few remaining trees in a fir stand at {{convert|3150|ft|m}} on the north slope; these have since all died due to heavy [[Browsing (predation)|deer browse]].<ref name="Kudish101<U+2013>106">{{cite book |title=The Catskill Forest: A History |last=Kudish |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Kudish |coauthors= |year=2000 |publisher=Purple Mountain Press |location=[[Fleischmanns, New York|Fleischmanns, NY]] |isbn=1930098022 |pages=101<U+2013>06}}</ref> A large stand of tall [[Eastern Hemlock|hemlock]] is located in Mine Hollow<ref name="Whites book">{{cite book |title=Catskill Day Hikes for All Seasons |last=White |first=Carol and David |year=2002 |publisher=[[Adirondack Mountain Club]] |location=[[Lake George (village), New York|Lake George, NY]] |isbn=0935272542 |pages=109<U+2013>11}}</ref> around {{convert|2400|ft|m}}.<ref name="Kudish101<U+2013>106" />

Most of the upper forest remains in [[Old-growth forest|first growth]], having never been logged or otherwise exploited. Kudish puts the average lower boundary of this area at around {{convert|2300|ft|m}}. The sole exception is {{convert|2940|ft|m}} on the north slope, where the absence old [[sugar maple]]s and the presence of [[Fraxinus americana|white ash]] are signs that a small area along the ridgeline was logged at some point in the past.<ref name="Kudish101<U+2013>106" />

The mountain's forests support a diverse [[ecosystem]] of typical Catskill species. [[American Black Bear|Black bear]] and [[white-tailed deer]], both favorites of [[hunting|hunters]], are the largest omnivores and herbivore mammalian species. Smaller mammals, mainly rodent species like [[porcupine]]s and [[chipmunk]]s are joined by salamanders and toads.

==History==

The [[Iroquois]] tribes who first settled the [[Hudson Valley]] rarely went high into the mountains except to hunt.<ref name="Kudish47">Kudish, 47.</ref> The earliest human settlements, by the descendants of [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]] and [[English colonization of the Americas|English]] colonists, near the mountain date to 1805.<ref name="Kudish155">Kudish, 155.</ref> Small farms were established on the mountain's lower slopes; as late as 1900 the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] [[quadrangle]] maps of the area show a road going up the ridge between Lost Clove and McKenley Hollow to a structure called Platt's Cabin just below {{convert|2500|ft|m}}. It was exceptionally high; most other farmland on that side went no higher than {{convert|1800|ft|m}}. A 1910 photograph shows a small farm in the head of Rider Hollow on the west.<ref name="Kudish101<U+2013>106" />

Balsam's slopes were originally more abundant in hemlock than they are now. Most were harvested by [[tanning|tanners]] for the [[tannin]] in their bark. Roads built to reach hemlock stands survive in McKenley Hollow as high as {{convert|2360|ft|m}}. The Mine Hollow stand is located at the end of another one on the west side.<ref name="Kudish101<U+2013>106" />

In 1885, political machinations by the Ulster County delegation to the [[New York State Legislature|state legislature]] led to the Catskill counties being included in the newly created [[Forest Preserve (New York)|Forest Preserve]] along with the [[Adirondack Mountains|Adirondacks]]. Tax-delinquent lands, many of them abandoned by loggers and tanners who had taken all the harvestable timber, which had become the county's by default were transferred to the state as a way of settling the county's outstanding [[property tax]] obligations to the state. They were to remain "forever wild", with no timber being harvested again from them. In 1894, a more strongly-worded version of the law was incorporated into the state [[constitution]] as Article 14.<ref name="Article 14">{{cite web|title=New York State Constitution Article XIV|url=http://www.adirondack-park.net/history/article14-text.html|publisher=State of New York, reprinted at adirondack-park.net|accessdate=March 2, 2010}}</ref>

Under these provisions, the state bought most of the land it currently owns on Balsam, about three-quarters of the mountain, in 1918. By 1931 the trail that had been built up Belleayre for tourists to reach its [[lookout tower]] had been extended over Balsam and was marked as a state-maintained trail on maps. The other two trails had been built by that time as well, the Oliverea-Mapledale trail possibly following an old cattle-herding route over the ridge. A few years later, the pairs of [[lean-to]]s in McKenley and Rider hollows were built.<ref name="Kudish101<U+2013>106" />

The large tract of state land on the range west of Esopus Creek and extending south toward the Beaver Kill Range was designated a [[wilderness area]] in the 1980s following a recommendation made in the first Catskill Park State Land Master Plan. This committed the state [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation|Department of Environmental Conservation]] (DEC) to manage the land with the goal of minimizing human impact as much as possible. Accordingly the lower of the two McKenley Hollow lean-tos was removed as it had become a site for parties<ref name="ADKguide128<U+2013>29">Wadsworth ''et al.'', 128<U+2013>29</ref> due to its proximity to the [[trailhead]] and parking lot on that side. The lower Rider Hollow lean-to burned in 1995 and was likewise not replaced.<ref name="Kudish101<U+2013>106" />

==Access==

Hikers usually approach Balsam from the south, by climbing the Oliverea-Mapledale Trail from either hollow to the PH-WB junction at {{convert|3030|ft|m}}<ref name="McAllister and Ochman">{{cite book |title=Hiking the Catskills |last=McAllister |first=Lee |last2=Ochman|first2=Myron|year=1989 |publisher=[[New York-New Jersey Trail Conference]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=0960396667|pages=235<U+2013>36}}</ref> and then going up the summit from there. The eastern approach, from McKenley Hollow, is more frequently used as it is more convenient to [[New York State Route 28|NY 28]], the main [[state highway]] through the central Catskills.<ref name="ADKguide128<U+2013>29" /> The western approach, from Rider Hollow, is more distant from main roads but regarded as more scenic.<ref name="ADK Guide199<U+2013>200">Wadsworth et al, 199<U+2013>200.</ref> It can be combined with the Mine Hollow Trail to make a loop route.<ref name="Whites book">{{cite book |title=Catskill Day Hikes for All Seasons |last=White |first=Carol and David |year=2002 |publisher=[[Adirondack Mountain Club]] |location=[[Lake George (village), New York|Lake George, NY]] |isbn=0935272542 |pages=109<U+2013>10}}</ref>

The McKenley Hollow approach begins at the parking lot 1 mile (1.6&nbsp;km) west of County Route 47 in Oliverea, {{convert|1600|ft|m}} above sea level, where state land begins on the south side of the brook that drains the hollow.<ref name="NYNJTC map">{{cite map |publisher=[[New York <U+2013> New Jersey Trail Conference]] |title=Central Catskill Trails |edition=8th |year=2005 |cartography=Koch, Ted and Benjamin, Sheryl |scale=1:63,360 |section=5I|isbn=1880775468}}</ref> The Oliverea-Mapledale Trail follows red [[trail blazing|plastic markers]] along the brook past the trail register and the former site of the first lean-to, then the second, in its first, climbing gently. It follows a wood road and begins to climb a little more, still paralleling the brook although higher above it, for the next 0.6 mile (1&nbsp;km).<ref name="Old ADK guide" />

A series of stone steps in the trail here begin a section that climbs over {{convert|450|ft|m}} in the next 0.25 mile (400 m). This 35% [[Grade (slope)|grade]] is the steepest section of trail in the Catskills.<ref name="3500 Club page" /> At the top it levels off and reaches the trail junction.

On the Rider Hollow side, the [[trailhead]] at the end of Rider Hollow Road is at a higher elevation, {{convert|2000|ft|m}}. Its first mile remains relatively level as it follows the brook on that side closely, passing the lean-to site on that side and a developed [[spring (hydrology)|spring]]. The Mine Hollow Trail's yellow markers fork off to the left {{convert|0.4|mi|m}} from the parking lot. Almost a mile later, the trail crosses another tributary and begins to climb steeply, ascending {{convert|750|ft|m}} in the next {{convert|0.8|mi|km}}. After passing another spring below a rock ledge,<ref name="Whites book" /> the trail levels out and reaches the junction.<ref name="ADK Guide199<U+2013>200" />

From the junction, the blue-blazed Pine Hill-West Branch Trail ascends the final {{convert|570|ft|m}} moderately up the {{convert|0.75|mi|km}} to the [[summit (topography)|summit]]. Just below the summit a sign at {{convert|3500|ft|m}} advises hikers of special DEC regulations allowing camping above that elevation only in wintertime, and prohibiting open fires. Shortly afterwards it crosses a corner of the large private holding that goes down to Lost Clove.<ref name="NYNJTC map" /> The mountain's actual height of land is a small mound less than {{convert|100|ft|m}} northeast of the trail, in open forest.<ref name="ADKGuide137">Wadsworth ''et al'', 137.</ref> The total ascent and mileage is {{convert|2000|ft|m}} and {{convert|2.15|mi|km}} from McKenley Hollow, {{convert|1600|ft|m}} and {{convert|1.95|mi|km}} from Rider Hollow.<ref name="ADKguide128<U+2013>29" /><ref name="ADK Guide199<U+2013>200" />

After the summit the trail drops down slightly again. In the saddle between the two summits a small ledge allows for views to the northwest over the hamlet of [[Big Indian, New York|Big Indian]] with [[West Kill Mountain|West Kill]], [[Hunter Mountain (New York)|Hunter]] and [[Plateau Mountain (New York)|Plateau]] mountains, all High Peaks, beyond.<ref name="McAllister and Ochman" /> It is the only view available from the mountain when the leaves are up.

Hikers from Rider Hollow taking the Mine Hollow loop continue over the lower northern summit to where the trail begins a {{convert|700|ft|m|adj=on}} descent through a rock cut down the north slope of Balsam to the Mine Hollow Trail junction, {{convert|1.3|mi|km}} north of the true summit. That trail descends at first steeply through more rock outcrops and then levels off in a hemlock grove. A mile (1.6&nbsp;km) from the junction it reaches the Oliverea-Mapledale Trail. The loop's total length is {{convert|5.2|mi|km}}.<ref name="Whites book" />

[[Backpacking (wilderness)|Backpackers]] doing overnight trips along the Pine Hill-West Branch Trail also climb the peak. From the northern end in [[Pine Hill, New York|Pine Hill]], it is {{convert|4.3|mi|km}} over the southern summit of Belleayre Mountain.<ref name="McAllister and Ochman" /> The southern terminus of the trail is near [[Frost Valley YMCA]] along County Route 47, {{convert|9.9|mi|km}} away, and entails climbing [[Big Indian Mountain (New York)|Big Indian]], [[Eagle Mountain (New York)|Eagle]] and Haynes mountains before Balsam.<ref name="ADKGuide137" />
