During the 20th century, Japan was heavily involved in commercial whaling. This continued until the [[International Whaling Commission]] (IWC) moratorium on commercial whaling went into effect in 1986. Japan continued to hunt whales using the scientific research provision in the agreement, and Japanese whaling is currently conducted by the [[Institute of Cetacean Research]].

These hunts are a source of conflict between pro- and [[anti-whaling]] countries and organizations.

Japan maintains that annual whaling is sustainable and necessary for scientific study and management of whale stocks.

==History==
{{See also|History of whaling}}

Archeological evidence in the form of whale remains discovered in burial mounds suggests that whales have been consumed in Japan since the [[J<U+014D>mon period]] (12,000 BC). Without the means to engage in active whaling, consumption at that time primarily stemmed from stranded whales.<ref name="isana-34-1">{{cite web |url=http://www.whaling.jp/english/isana/no34_01.html |title=Whale Strandings in Hokkaido |first=Takashi |last=Matsuishi |date=December 2007 |work=ISANA |publisher=Japan Whaling Association |page=1 }}</ref> Surviving [[Ainu people|Ainu]] folklore reveals a long history of whaling<ref name="isana-34-1" /> and a spiritual association with whales.<ref name="etter-1949">{{cite book |last=Etter |first=Carl |title=Ainu Folklore: Traditions and Culture of the Vanishing Aborigines of Japan |year=1949 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=9bkcnnuAOMoC&printsec=frontcover&q= |pages=164<U+2013>171 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn=978-1-4179-7697-3 }}</ref> The earliest records of hand thrown harpoons date back to the 12th century.<ref name="jwa-history">{{cite web |url=http://www.whaling.jp/english/history.html |title=History of Whaling |publisher=Japan Whaling Association |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |quote=12th century Hand-harpoon whaling starts in Japan }}</ref>

[[File:Traditional Whaling in Taiji.jpg|thumb|800px|center|Inshore whaling in [[Taiji, Wakayama|Taiji]], Japan]]

===Organized whaling===
Organized open-boat shore whaling began in the 1570s; and continued into the early 20th century.<ref name="kasuya-2002">{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals |author=Kasuya |year=2002 }}</ref> Techniques were developed in the 17th century in [[Taiji, Wakayama]]. Wada Chubei Yorimoto established a [[fishery]] by organizing the group hunting system in 1606. Whalers would spot whales from stations along the shore and launch boats to catch them with harpoons and lances. His grandson, Wada Kakuemon Yoriharu, later known as Taiji Kakuemon Yoriharu, invented the whaling net technique called Amitori-shiki (<U+7DB2><U+53D6><U+308A><U+5F0F>).<ref name="nbwm-jtw">{{cite web |url=http://www.whalingmuseum.org/online_exhibits/manjiro/11.swf |title=Japanese Traditional Whaling |publisher=[[New Bedford Whaling Museum]] |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19 }}</ref><ref name="icr-history">{{cite web |url=http://www.icrwhale.org/japan-history.htm |title=Human Relationships with Whales |publisher=[[Institute of Cetacean Research]] |date=  |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2002-11-22 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021122171924/http://www.icrwhale.org/japan-history.htm }}</ref><ref name="thara-1959">{{cite journal |publisher=Cambridge University Press |title=The Japanese Family Storehouse; Or the Millionaires Gospel Modernised |year=1959 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ux89AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&q= |page=175 |last=Ihara |first=Saikaku |last2=Sargent |first2=G. W. }}</ref>

{{Quotation|Instead of trying to harpoon whales in open water, now twenty or more boats would encircle a whale and make a racket, driving it towards the shallows into nets wielded by a second group of six boats. There harpooners would approach in four boats of their own. The nets made escape more difficult and, in its struggle to escape, the whale got tired sooner.}}

[[Right whale]]s, [[humpback whale]]s, [[Gray whale|gray]], and [[fin whale]]s were primarily hunted.<ref name="icr-history" /> [[Blue whale]]s, [[Sei whale|sei]], [[Bryde's whale|Bryde's]] and [[sperm whale]]s were however also taken when possible.

Once ashore, the whale was quickly flensed and divided into its separate parts for various warehouses and further processing. Although the primary use for whales was meat, the entire whale was utilized in a variety of products including lamp oil, soaps, fertilizer, folding fans ([[baleen]]), and more. This method of whaling required a significant financial investment from rich individuals to compensate for the sizable labor force. However, whaling remained entwined with ritual and unlike their contemporary European counterparts the early Japanese coastal whalers considered whales a valuable resource and did not over-exploit local stocks.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Richard |publisher=The Lyons Press |title=Men and Whales |year=1999 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=kygGAAAACAAJ&dq=men+and+whales |pages=83<U+2013>88 |isbn=978-1-55821-696-9 }}</ref>

===Modernization===
Norwegian-style modern whaling, based on the use of power-driven vessels, cannons and exploding harpoons, was introduced in the [[Meiji era]] largely through the efforts of [[J<U+016B>r<U+014D> Oka]] who is considered the "father of modern Japanese whaling".<ref>http://japanwhaling.weebly.com/history.html</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.de/books?id=-CxTgZJ-CZEC&pg=PA240&dq=father+of+japanese+whaling&hl=en&sa=X&ei=avWIU6ruNqSn4gSarYHgCg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=father&f=false |title=A Savage History: A history of whaling in the Southern and Pacific Oceans p240 |publisher=Books.google.de |date=2012-12-01 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.de/books?id=gCkRAAAAYAAJ&q=father+of+japanese+whaling&dq=father+of+japanese+whaling&hl=en&sa=X&ei=avWIU6ruNqSn4gSarYHgCg&redir_esc=y |title=Men and Whales| page=266 |publisher=Books.google.de |date=2007-11-13 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref> Oka traveled the world gathering information about whaling practices including to Norway for harpoons, cannons and expertise. He also established the first modern whaling company in Japan in 1899, Nihon Enyo Gyogyo K.K. which took its first whale on February 4, 1900 with a Norwegian gunner, Morten Pedersen.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Richard |publisher=The Lyons Press |title=Men and Whales |year=1999 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=kygGAAAACAAJ&dq=men+and+whales |page=266 |isbn=978-1-55821-696-9 }}</ref><ref name="Scully 2002 157">{{cite book |last=Scully |first=Mathew |publisher =St. Martin's Griffin |title=Dominion: the power of man, the suffering of animals, and the call to mercy |year=2002 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=_htG-Pi2GboC&printsec=frontcover&q= |page=157 |isbn=978-0-312-31973-1 }}</ref>

In the early 20th century, Juro Oka dominated the whale meat market in Japan with assistance and instruction from Norwegian whalers and their leased or purchased ships. Another boost was provided by the capture of a Russian whaling fleet and subsequent transfer to Toyo GyoGyo Co. Ltd.<ref>{{cite book |last=Morikawa |first=Jun |publisher=Columbia University Press |title=Whaling in Japan: Power, Politics, and Diplomacy |year=2009 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=6Rid73dnTmgC&printsec=frontcover&q= |page=21 |isbn=978-0-231-70118-1 }}</ref>
As Japan's whaling industry expanded into new territory, including Korean waters, ship production and oil processing, Oka's company (renamed Toyo Hogei K.K.) returned significant profits to its investors which led to increased Japanese competition. Oka later became the first president of the Japan Whaling and Fishing Association, established in 1908.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Richard |publisher=The Lyons Press |title=Men and Whales |year=1999 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=kygGAAAACAAJ&dq=men+and+whales |pages=266<U+2013>267 |isbn=978-1-55821-696-9 }}</ref><ref name="bh-whaling">{{cite web |url=http://www.businesshistory.com/ind._whaling.php |title=INDUSTRIES: Business History of Whaling |publisher=Business History |accessdate=2009-12-19 }}</ref>

{{Quotation|''I am firmly convinced that we shall become one of the greatest whaling nations in the world. The whaling grounds round Korea and Japan offer unlimited possibilities, and should stocks of whales, contrary to expectations, fail in those areas, we have the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea to the north and we are aware of the great treasure houses to the south. The day will come when we shall hear one morning that whales have been caught in the Arctic and in the evening that whales are being hunted in the Antarctic.''<ref name="Scully 2002 157"/><br />

However, at the start of the 20th century local traditions conflicted with modern whaling practices. In 1911 the conflict turned violent in Same Village, Aomori Prefecture. Ocean pollution from the whaling stations, including large quantities of oil and blood runoff, angered the local fishermen and threatened their own fishing grounds. In protest the fishermen burned a Toyo Hogei facility down. The people of the Same region also did not consume whales and considered them sacred.<ref>{{cite book |last=Morikawa |first=Jun |publisher=Columbia University Press |title=Whaling in Japan: Power, Politics, and Diplomacy |year=2009 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=6Rid73dnTmgC&printsec=frontcover&q= |page=22 |isbn=978-0-231-70118-1 }}</ref>

[[The League of Nations]] raised concerns about the [[over-exploitation]] of whale stocks and called for conservation measures in 1925. This eventually led to the Geneva Convention for the Regulation of Whaling which was presented in 1931 but did not enter into force until 1934 and was completely ignored by Japan and Germany.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mulvaney |first=Kieran |publisher=Island Press |title=The whaling season: an inside account of the struggle to stop commercial whaling |year=2003 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=VqKqWaEUYuMC&printsec=frontcover&q= |page=115 |isbn=978-1-55963-978-1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/iwc-factsheet-history.pdf |format=PDF |title=History and Future |work=60th annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission |publisher=Department of the Environment |location=Australia |year=2008 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2008-08-16 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080816190224/http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/iwc-factsheet-history.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |publisher=Academic Press |title=Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals |year=2002 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=2rkHQpToi9sC&printsec=frontcover&q= |page=625 |isbn=978-0-12-373553-9 |last=Perrin |first=W.

===Antarctica===
[[Factory ship]]s were not used by Japan until the 1930s. As whale catches diminished in coastal waters, Japan looked to Antarctica. Toyo Hogei K.K. purchased the Norwegian factory ship, ''Antarctic,'' renaming it the ''Tonan Maru'' in 1934. Refrigerator ships were sent along to freeze and transport the meat back to Japan. By capitalizing on both the meat and oil of whales, the Japanese industry continued to out-compete other whaling nations. Improvements in technology such as the world's first diesel-powered whale catcher, the ''Seki Maru'', also increased the capacity to take whales. In the years building up to World War II, the Germans purchased [[whale oil]] from Japan and both nations used it in preparation for war.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Richard |publisher=The Lyons Press |title=Men and Whales |year=1999 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=kygGAAAACAAJ&dq=men+and+whales |pages=369<U+2013>370 |isbn=978-1-55821-696-9 }}</ref>

In 1937 London, the International Conference on Whaling, which Japan did not attend, led to additional limits on pelagic whaling in order to prevent excessive exploitation (and specifically the extinction of the blue whale) creating the International Agreement for the Regulation of Whaling. Regarding voluntary acceptance of restrictions:

{{Quotation|''This is the more important in that Japan, who has not yet acceded to the 1931 Convention is largely increasing her whaling fleet in the Antarctic...''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1937v01/reference/frus.frus1937v01.i0022.pdf |format=PDF |title=International Conference for the Regulation of Whaling, London, May 24 <U+2013> June 8, 1937 |accessdate=2012-01-31 }}</ref>}}

Regardless of efforts to establish limits, in part due to Japan ignoring an 89 day season limit and continuing for 125 days, a record 45,010 whales were taken in a single season. The Protocol to the International Agreement for the Regulation of Whaling, signed in 1938, established additional restrictions on whaling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iea.uoregon.edu/texts/1938-Protocol-1937-Whaling.EN.htm |title=Protocol To The International Agreement For The Regulation Of Whaling |work= |publisher=  |date=June 8, 1937 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2011-07-20 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110720095348/http://iea.uoregon.edu/texts/1938-Protocol-1937-Whaling.EN.htm }}</ref>
Despite the attendance of Japanese representatives, Japan did not sign the agreement and started hunting for humpback and undersized whales five weeks prior to the defined start of the season.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Richard |publisher=The Lyons Press |title=Men and Whales |year=1999 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=kygGAAAACAAJ&dq=men+and+whales |page=387 |isbn=978-1-55821-696-9 }}</ref>
By 1939 Germany and Japan accounted for 30% of the world's whale take.<ref name="bh-whaling"/>

===World War II===
[[File:Tonan Maru no. 2 (1937).jpg|thumb|right|The ''Tonan Maru No. 2'' whaling factory ship, drafted into military use, was damaged by a Dutch submarine while taking part in the landing at [[Kuching]], Borneo.]]

During the second world war Japan's whaling was significantly limited to more familiar hunting grounds, such as the Bonin Islands, to provide meat and oil for domestic and military use. Whaling there was halted in March, 1945 when the islands were taken by US forces. By November 1945 the whaling stations received permission to reopen; however, most whaling ships had been commandeered by the Japanese navy, and by the end of the war the factory ships and most of the whale catchers had been sunk.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://econweb.rutgers.edu/tsurumi/whaling.pdf |format=PDF  |title=Economics of Japan |first=Hiroki |last=Tsurumi |authorlink= |accessdate=2009-12-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Richard |publisher=The Lyons Press |title=Men and Whales |year=1999 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=kygGAAAACAAJ&dq=men+and+whales |page=370 |isbn=978-1-55821-696-9 }}</ref>

General [[Douglas MacArthur]] encouraged the surrendered Japan to continue whaling in order to provide a cheap source of meat to starving people (and millions of dollars in oil for the USA and Europe).<ref name="Ellis 1999 405">{{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Richard |publisher=The Lyons Press |title=Men and Whales |year=1999 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=kygGAAAACAAJ&dq=men+and+whales |page=405 |isbn=978-1-55821-696-9 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/climate-watch/blame-general-macarthur-for-whaling-row/2007/12/18/1197740272644.html |title=Blame General MacArthur for whaling row |first=Brendan |last=Nicholson |date=December 19, 2007 |work=The Age |location=Melbourne }}</ref> The Japanese whaling industry quickly recovered as MacArthur authorized two tankers to be converted into factory ships, the ''[[Hashidate Maru]]'' and the ''[[Nisshin Maru#History|Nisshin Maru]]''. Whale catchers once again took blue whales, fins, humpbacks and sperm whales in the Antarctic and elsewhere.<ref name="Ellis 1999 405"/>

The first post-war expedition was overseen by a US naval officer, Lieutenant David McCracken, and observed by Australian Kenneth Coonan. Coonan expressed disapproval of McCracken in his reports of violated regulations and waste dumped over the side when the fleet began killing whales faster than they could be processed. McCracken even briefly joined in whaling with the Japanese crew of a whale catcher and detailed the trip in his 1948 book, ''Four Months on a Jap Whaler''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Darby |first=Andrew |publisher=Allen & Unwin |title=Harpoon: into the heart of whaling |year=2007 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=hJPRiQFhCFIC&printsec=frontcover&q= |pages=52<U+2013>57 |isbn=978-1-74114-611-0 }}</ref>

The post-war recovery established whale meat as a nation-wide food source for the first time. In 1947 whale meat made up over 50 percent of the meat consumed in Japan. The market significantly increased through commercial sale and public distribution. In 1954, the School Lunch Act also included whale meat in compulsory education (elementary and middle school) to improve the nutrition of Japanese children.

===ICRW and IWC===
[[File:ICRW-signing-1946-US.jpg|thumb|right|Signing the [[International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling]], Washington, D.C. Dec 2, 1946]]

The [[International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling]] was created in 1946 in Washington to "provide for the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry".<ref name="IWCConvention">{{cite web |url=http://iwc.int/cache/downloads/1r2jdhu5xtuswws0ocw04wgcw/convention.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Convention |publisher=IWC |date=December 2, 1946 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2013-11-11 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131111095403/http://iwc.int/cache/downloads/1r2jdhu5xtuswws0ocw04wgcw/convention.pdf |accessdate=2010-11-26 }}</ref> Based on the previous 1937 International Agreement and subsequent Protocols to that agreement in 1938 and 1945, the ICRW led to the 1949 creation of the [[International Whaling Commission]] and consists of guidelines for the international regulation of coastal and pelagic whaling. Japan joined the IWC in 1951.<ref name="jwa-history"/>

Japan would later make heavy use of one particular article of the ICRW despite the condemnation of environmental organizations and anti-whaling nations.

{{Quotation|Article VIII<br />
<br />
 1. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Convention any Contracting Government may grant to any of its nationals a special permit authorizing that national to kill, take and treat whales for purposes of scientific research subject to such restrictions as to number and subject to such other conditions as the Contracting Government thinks fit, and the killing, taking, and treating of whales in accordance with the provisions of this Article shall be exempt from the operation of this Convention. Each Contracting Government shall report at once to the Commission all such authorizations which it has granted.

===Pirate whaling===
As the IWC enacted regulation regarding whaling a number of unregulated operations acting outside of the laws of member nations became notorious in the mid-late 20th century. For example, a large private whaling fleet was owned (through a variety of holding companies and flags of convenience) by shipping magnate [[Aristotle Onassis]] and gained notoriety for ignoring all limits of size and species. When the Peruvian navy finally stopped and seized the Onassis fleet,{{when|date=February 2014}} and just as sanctions were to be applied, the entire fleet was sold to Japan for $8.5 million. Onassis' factory ship, the ''Olympic Challenger'', was renamed the ''Kyokuyo Maru II''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Richard |publisher=The Lyons Press |title=Men and Whales |year=1999 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=kygGAAAACAAJ&dq=men+and+whales |pages=431<U+2013>433 |isbn=978-1-55821-696-9 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Darby |first=Andrew |publisher=Allen & Unwin |title=Harpoon: into the heart of whaling |year=2007 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=hJPRiQFhCFIC&printsec=frontcover&q= |page=66 |isbn=978-1-74114-611-0 }}</ref>

The Japanese trawler, ''Shunyo-maru'', later became a combined catcher/factory whaling ship, MV ''Tonna'', and was owned by Andrew M. Behr who also owned the infamous pirate whaling ship, ''Sierra''. The ''Tonna'' is famous for its demise. In 1978 with full holds the ''Tonna'' landed another 50 ton fin whale.

===Consolidation===
As quotas and resources were reduced and restrictions increased, the commercial viability of large competing whaling fleets was also diminished. In order to preserve the industry, six Japanese whaling companies negotiated an agreement through the Japan Fisheries Agency in July 1975. The six companies (Nihon Suisan, Taiyo Gyogyo, Kyokuyo, Nitto Hogei, Nihon Hogei and Hokuyo Hogei) merged to create a new company, Nihon Kyodo Hogei Co., Ltd. on February 15, 1976. Former president of the Japan Fisheries Association and former Director-General of the Japan Fisheries Agency, Iwao Fujita, became the first Managing Director by appointment.<ref>{{cite book |last=Morikawa |first=Jun |publisher=Columbia University Press |title=Whaling in Japan: Power, Politics, and Diplomacy |year=2009 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=6Rid73dnTmgC&printsec=frontcover&q= |page=25 |isbn=978-0-231-70118-1 }}</ref>

In April, 1976, Shintaro Abe, the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, declared government support for the newly formed company.

{{Quotation|''We ask that the flame of the whaling industry will not be put out and that you do your best to secure Japan's food supplies.

Nihon Kyodo Hogei Co. Ltd was later renamed Kyodo Senpaku Co. Ltd and merged with the Japan Whaling Association and Institute of Cetacean Research to create the modern Institute of Cetacean Research in 1987.<ref>{{cite book |last=Morikawa |first=Jun |publisher=Columbia University Press |title=Whaling in Japan: Power, Politics, and Diplomacy |year=2009 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=6Rid73dnTmgC&printsec=frontcover&q= |page=38 |isbn=978-0-231-70118-1 }}</ref>

===Moratorium===
In 1972, the United Nations Environmental Conference produced a 52<U+2013>0 vote in favor of a 10 year global moratorium on commercial whaling. However, the UN resolution was not adopted by the IWC by a vote of 6-no, 4-yes and 4-abstain. Japan, Russia, Iceland, Norway, South Africa and Panama voted no.<ref name="Day 1987 29<U+2013>32">{{cite book |last=Day |first=David |title=The Whale War |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=1987 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=TqwOAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&q= |pages=29<U+2013>32 |isbn=978-0-7102-1186-6 }}</ref>

In 1973, a moratorium was once again proposed and voted down in the IWC lacking the required 3/4 majority (8-yes, 5-no, 1-abstain). Japan, Russia, Iceland, Norway and South Africa voted no.<ref name="Day 1987 29<U+2013>32"/> Between 1973 and 1982 the IWC would see its membership increase from 14 nations to 37, perhaps stacking the vote in favor of anti-whaling nations. In 1980 and 1981 two more votes failed to establish a moratorium by a 3/4 majority (13<U+2013>9<U+2013>2 and 16<U+2013>8<U+2013>3).<ref>{{cite book |last=Darby |first=Andrew |title=Harpoon: Into the Heart of Whaling |publisher=Allen & Unwin |year=2007 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=hJPRiQFhCFIC&printsec=frontcover&q= |pages=125<U+2013>126 |isbn=978-1-74114-611-0 }}</ref>

In 1982, the IWC finally voted in favor of a moratorium on commercial whaling to go into force in 1986 (25<U+2013>7<U+2013>5). Japan objected to the moratorium and continued whaling (''Under the ICRW an objecting nation is exempted from the disputed regulations. Japan also continued to hunt sperm whales despite a 1981 IWC zero catch quota.''). The United States would play a significant role in Japan's acceptance of a global moratorium on commercial whaling due to its domestic laws. In particular the 1971 Pelly Amendment to the US Fishermen's Protection Act gives the US President legal authority to prohibit importation of fish products from any nation that is diminishing the effectiveness of fisheries conservation programs. It was later strengthened by the 1979 Packwood-Magnuson Amendment to the Fishery Conservation and Management Act giving the same sanctioning power with regard to the ICRW.<ref name="Day 1987 29<U+2013>32"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://oceancommission.gov/documents/gov_oceans/Protective.PDF |format=PDF |title=Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 |work= |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2003-02-20 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030220001911/http://www.oceancommission.gov/documents/gov_oceans/Protective.PDF }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Chayes |first=Antonia |title=The new sovereignty: compliance with international regulatory agreements |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1998 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=v2rcabdXIvQC&printsec=frontcover&q= |pages=94<U+2013>96 |isbn=978-0-674-61783-4 }}</ref>

Potential US sanctions jeopardized access for Japanese fisheries to Alaskan waters, with an annual catch of a million [[tonne]]s of fish ({{convert|1,000,000|MT|ST LT|lk=out|disp=output only}}), worth an estimated $425 million per year. A negotiated settlement was reached, allowing Japan to continue commercial whaling without the threat of US sanctions until 1988, with an agreement to drop Japan's objection to the moratorium in 1985. However, conservation groups sued the United States Secretary of Commerce, claiming that the law did not allow any deals. That claim was defeated by a US Supreme Court decision in 1986, and, as agreed, Japan withdrew its objection to the moratorium and ceased commercial whaling by 1988. Japan's access to Alaskan waters was later phased out anyway, due in part to pressure from US fishermen and conservationists, and also in response to Japan's subsequent use of research whaling.<ref>{{cite news |last=Black |first=Richard |title=Did Greens help kill the whale? |publisher=BBC News |date=May 16, 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6659401.stm }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Darby |first=Andrew |title=Harpoon: Into the Heart of Whaling |publisher=Allen & Unwin |year=2007 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=hJPRiQFhCFIC&printsec=frontcover&q= |pages=145<U+2013>166 |isbn=978-1-74114-611-0 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/whale-wars/about-whaling/whaling-japan-withdraw-moratorium.htm |title=Why Did Japan Withdraw Its Opposition to the Moratorium? |work=Whale Wars |publisher=Discovery |date=December 30, 2009 |deadurl=no |archivedate=2010-01-06 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100106183848/http://animal.discovery.com/tv/whale-wars/whaling/japan-withdraw-moratorium.html }}</ref>

===Research whaling===
In 1976, the quota for Southern Hemisphere [[Bryde's whale]]s was set to zero by the IWC. However, Japan proceeded to take 225 of them during the 76<U+2013>77 season by issuing itself a permit to take whales for scientific research under Article VIII of the ICRW. Following this event, the IWC recommended all future applications of Article VIII be reviewed by the IWC scientific committee.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Richard |publisher=The Lyons Press |title=Men and Whales |year=1999 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=kygGAAAACAAJ&dq=men+and+whales |pages=408<U+2013>409 |isbn=978-1-55821-696-9 }}</ref>

In 1986, Japan introduced a similar proposal and later issued itself a scientific permit to take 825 [[minke]] whales and 50 [[sperm whale]]s every year for ten years. Despite the fact that the IWC scientific committee rejected its research proposals, Japan continued whaling.

The IWC adopted a resolution in 1987 recommending Japan not proceed until disagreements over its research proposals were resolved. A second resolution was also adopted on February 14, 1988 recommending Japan not proceed. On February 9, 1988 Japanese whalers killed the first minke whale in Antarctic waters under the new self issued research whaling permit. U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] responded by cutting off Japanese fishing privileges in U.S. waters on April 6, 1988 under the Packwood-Magnuson Amendment.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Richard |publisher=The Lyons Press |title=Men and Whales |year=1999 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=kygGAAAACAAJ&dq=men+and+whales |pages=490<U+2013>491 |isbn=978-1-55821-696-9 }}</ref><ref name="reagan.utexas.edu">{{cite web |url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1988/040688e.htm |title=Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate Reporting on Japanese whaling Activities |publisher=Reagan.utexas.edu |accessdate=2010-11-26 }}</ref>

{{Quotation|''Given the lack of any evidence that Japan is bringing its whaling activities into conformance with the recommendations of the IWC, I am directing the Secretary of State under the Packwood-Magnuson Amendment to withhold 100 percent of the fishing privileges that would otherwise be available to Japan in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. Japan has requested the opportunity to fish for 3,000 metric tons of sea snails and 5,000 metric tons of Pacific whiting. These requests will be denied. In addition, Japan will be barred from any future allocations of fishing privileges for any other species, including Pacific cod, until the Secretary of Commerce determines that the situation has been corrected.''<ref name="reagan.utexas.edu" /><br />

Japan has since conducted research whaling programs in the North Pacific (JARPN 1994<U+2013>1999, JARPN II 2000 <U+2013> present) and in Antarctica (JARPA 1988<U+2013>2005, JARPA II 2005 <U+2013> present). The IWC has asked its members that conduct research whaling programs to demonstrate that the research provides critical information, that the research is needed for whale management purposes, and that non-lethal research techniques are not able to provide the same information. The IWC has issued at least 19 resolutions criticizing Japan for failing to meet these conditions and asking it to stop issuing permits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lclark.edu/law/clinics/international_environmental_law_project/our_work/whaling/|title=International Environmental Law Project (IELP): Whaling and the International Whaling Commission|publisher=Lewis & Clark Law School |date= |accessdate=2010-12-27 }}</ref>

The current JARPA II permit has been "for 850<U+00B1>10% Antarctic minke whales, 50 fin whales and 50 humpback whales annually. To date, Japan has refrained from taking humpback whales."<ref>{{cite web |title=Scientific Permit Whaling |url=http://iwc.int/permits |publisher=International Whaling Commission |date= |accessdate=2013-03-06 }}</ref>

===Normalization===
In 1994, at its 46th annual meeting, the IWC established the [[Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary]] in a 23<U+2013>1<U+2013>8 vote. Commercial whaling is prohibited within the sanctuary boundaries. Only Japan voted in opposition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Whale Sanctuaries: Establishment of the International Whaling Commission's sanctuaries|publisher=[[International Whaling Commission]] |date=January 9, 2009 |url=http://iwc.int/sanctuaries }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Darby |first=Andrew|publisher=Allen & Unwin|title=Harpoon: Into the Heart of Whaling |year=2007 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=hJPRiQFhCFIC |pages=173, 213 |isbn=978-1-74114-611-0 }}</ref>

As the size of the IWC continued to grow, so did the influence of Japan within the commission. For example, many new Caribbean member nations voted in favor of whaling interests in 2000 including the defeat of a proposed [[South Pacific Whale Sanctuary]]. Additional support for whaling was gained in the Pacific, Africa and South-East Asia. As many of these nations received economic aid from Japan, accusations of vote buying were made by anti-whaling groups. In 2001, Japanese fisheries official Masayuki Komatsu stated Japan used overseas development aid as a tool to gain influence.<ref>{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Paul |title=Japan admits using aid to build pro-whaling vote|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=November 11, 1999 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/1999/nov/11/whaling.internationalnews  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Watts |first=Johnathan |title=Japan admits buying allies on whaling |work=The Guardian|location=London |date=July 19, 2001 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/jul/19/japan.whaling }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Japan admits trading whale votes|publisher=BBC News|date=July 18, 2001|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1444818.stm  }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Darby |first=Andrew |publisher=Allen & Unwin |title=Harpoon: into the heart of whaling |year=2007 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=hJPRiQFhCFIC&printsec=frontcover&q= |pages=213<U+2013>217, 220<U+2013>222, 229 |isbn=978-1-74114-611-0 }}</ref>

In 2006, the pro-whaling bloc won a symbolic victory in a non-binding resolution implying the moratorium on commercial whaling was both temporary and unnecessary (33<U+2013>32<U+2013>1).<ref>{{cite news|title=Japan gains key whaling victory |publisher=BBC News |date=June 19, 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5093350.stm  }}</ref>

Japan followed with a proposal to 'normalize' the IWC. In the proposal, Japan's representatives claimed the IWC had become dysfunctional in favor of the total elimination of whaling. It also suggested reforms such as the use of secret ballots and increased recognition of cultural differences in the IWC. A Conference for the Normalization of the International Whaling Commission was hosted by Japan in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |title=Conference for the Normalization of the International Whaling Commission|publisher=International Whaling Commission |date=February 18, 2008 |url=http://iwc.int/index.php?cID=193&cType=document&download=1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Normalizing the International Whaling Commission |publisher=International Whaling Commission <U+2013> Japan |date=June 16, 2006 |url=http://iwcoffice.org/_documents/commission/IWC58docs/58-12.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2006-09-28 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060928145056/http://www.iwcoffice.org/_documents/commission/IWC58docs/58-12.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Lies |first=Elaine |title=Japan hosts whaling meet as anti-whalers boycott |publisher=Reuters |date=February 13, 2007 |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUST26108020070213 }}</ref>

After over 50 years of control, Japan's center-right conservative party, Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), lost in 2009 elections to the opposing left, Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). Environmental organizations had hoped the change in government would bring about an end to Japanese whaling. However, in 2009 the Foreign Minister of Japan, Katsuya Okada, explained that whaling would continue to receive support as a matter of policy.<ref name="ABC_AU_2586866">{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-12-11/japan-vows-to-carry-on-whaling/2586866?section=justin |title=Japan vows to carry on whaling |authorlink=Mark Willacy |first=Mark |last=Willacy |date=December 11, 2009 |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] }}</ref><ref name="News.com.au_1225809220883">{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/well-continue-whale-kill-japan-insists/story-e6frg6so-1225809220883 |title=We'll continue whale kill, Japan insists |last=Alford |first=Peter |date=December 11, 2009 |work=The Australian }}</ref>

A 2010 undercover investigation by reporters from the UK's Sunday Times revealed the officials of many developing countries accepted financial compensation from Japan for support in the IWC. Separate from millions in overseas development aid, membership fees, paid flights, hotel stays and spending money was all provided, by Japan, to gain the support of IWC delegates. In some cases cash was presented in envelopes by Japanese officials.<ref>{{cite news |title=Flights, girls and cash buy Japan whaling votes |work=The Times |location=London |date=June 13, 2010 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article7149086.ece }}</ref> Despite recordings from the investigation, officials implicated in the report have denied accepting bribes in exchange for votes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pacific nations deny selling Japan whaling votes |agency=AFP |date=June 17, 2010 |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jNVeqfWuMaWcjF-p24bPN16QM41Q }} {{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref>

In 2011, at the 63rd meeting of the IWC, Japan demonstrated the progress of its 'normalization' policy. When South American countries proposed a vote to establish a new whale sanctuary in the South Atlantic Ocean, Japanese delegates led Iceland, several Caribbean countries, and additional representatives in a walkout. As a result, the vote was postponed for one year along with other matters pending consideration by the commission.<ref>{{cite news |title=Whaling meeting 'ignores needs of whales' |publisher=BBC News |first=Richard |last=Black |date=July 14, 2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14153779 }}</ref>

==Production==
Japanese whaling is conducted in both [[pelagic zone|pelagic]] (open-ocean) areas in the North Pacific Ocean and the Southern Ocean near Antarctica. Coastal waters are also utilized for small-type coastal whaling of dolphins and other small cetaceans. Large and small whales are sometimes taken as [[bycatch]] in the nets of Japanese fishing vessels as well.

Japan's pelagic whaling fleet, which annually hunts large whales in the [[Southern Ocean]], consists of a number of ships for hunting and processing whale catch as well as securing the hunt against protests. During the 2009<U+2013>10 season, the Japanese fleet included a [[factory ship]], four whale catchers and two security patrol vessels.<!-- The New Zealand Herald article refers to the two security vessels in separate sentences. --> The Japanese self-imposed quota includes 935 minke, 50 fin and 50 humpback whales per season.<ref name="Hardline">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10619393&pnum=0 |title=Hardline warrior in war to save the whale |date=January 11, 2010 |publisher=The New Zealand Herald }}</ref>

When whales are spotted the whale catchers will engage in pursuit. A harpoon cannon with a grenade tipped harpoon is fired at the target whale. A rope is trailed from the harpoon in order to prevent the whale from being lost. If the whale is struck and not killed instantly by the explosive tipped harpoon, a second harpoon may be used or the whale may be shot with a rifle until dead. A past method of using a second harpoon to electrocute whales is now forbidden by the IWC. Environmental groups have reported whales being dragged backward and drowned.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article722308.ece |title=Japan invents super-harpoon to kill whales |first=Jonathan |last=Leake |first2=Julian |last2=Ryall |date=January 29, 2006 |work=The Sunday Times |location=London }}</ref>

Each caught whale is secured to the side of a whale catcher with rope. Lines are later used to transfer the whales from the whale catcher to the factory ship. Whales are next winched onto the factory ship through a slipway at the stern of the vessel. On the flensing deck several workers use specialized tools to butcher the whale. Usable product is delivered to the lower decks of the ship for further processing and refrigerated storage. Non usable product is dumped back into the ocean.

Additional regulations from the [[United Nations International Maritime Organization]] took effect on August 1, 2011 prohibiting ships using heavy oil from navigation in the [[Antarctic Treaty System]] area to prevent pollution. The IMO ''Guidelines For Ships Operating In Ice-Covered Waters'' also establishes requirements for a double-hull strengthened against ice-related damage. The Japanese factory ship ''[[Nisshin Maru]]'' does not currently meet these IMO standards.<ref name="Darby.SMH.1">{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/whale-watch/new-rules-for-safe-shipping-may-save-whales-20090717-do9b.html |title=New rules for safe shipping may save whales |last=Darby |first=Andrew |date=July 18, 2009 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald }}</ref><ref name="IMO.2011">{{cite press release |publisher=International Maritime Organization (IMO) |date=July 29, 2011 |title=Antarctic fuel oil ban and North American ECA MARPOL amendments enter into force on 1 August 2011 |url=http://www.imo.org/MediaCentre/PressBriefings/Pages/44-MARPOL-amends.aspx  }}</ref><ref name="MarEx.1">{{cite news |url=http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/2008-04-10-imo-backing-antarctic-ship-review |title=IMO Backing Antarctic Ship Review |date=March 9, 2011 |publisher=The Maritime Executive }}</ref>

===Small type coastal whaling===
{{See also|Dolphin drive hunting}}

Coastal fishing fleets that hunt dolphins use many small boats in a coordinated effort. The fishermen bang metal poles in the water in order to frighten and therefore guide noise-sensitive dolphins toward the shore. A series of nets are then used to corral the dolphins in. Divers and fishermen in boats next lance or cut the throats of the dolphins and haul them away to a nearby shore station for processing. A few dolphins are selected for sale to aquariums and spared for the marine park entertainment industry.

The practice of dolphin drive hunting in [[Taiji, Wakayama|Taiji]], Japan was recently the subject of a documentary film entitled ''[[The Cove (film)|The Cove]]''.

Japanese whalers have hunted Baird's beaked whales on the Boso Peninsula, Wada, since the 17th century. Once landed just off the coast of Japan, the beaked whales are pulled onto a landing station with ropes and then butchered for sale. The meat is sold as food and the rest is used for fertilizer.

In May 2007 the IWC rejected a proposal to expand coastal catches. The quota was limited to a total of 66 whales between four whaling towns. The whalers of Wada encourage local children to attend the first butchering of each season followed by a community event where whale meat is served.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19352213 |title=Japan begins coastal whaling season |work=World environment news |publisher=MSNBC |date=June 21, 2007 }}</ref>

===Bycatch===
In 2009, published DNA analysis of whale meat from Japanese markets suggested as many as 150 large whales from vulnerable coastal stocks were taken annually as bycatch. Japan legally allows the commercial sale of whales caught incidentally, entangled in fishing nets designed to catch coastal fish. Market surveys also detected migratory whales such as the endangered  Humpback<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/cetaceans/humpbackwhale.htm |title=Humpback Whale |publisher=Nmfs.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=dfg.webmaster@alaska.gov |url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=specialstatus.fedsummary&species=humpbackwhale |title=Humpback Whale, Fererally Endangered |publisher=Adfg.alaska.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref> and endangered Gray whales,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/cetaceans/about/gray_whale222/ |title=WWF - Grey Whale |publisher=Wwf.panda.org |date=2010-05-10 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/cetaceans/graywhale.htm |title=Gray Whale - Enfangered |publisher=Nmfs.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref> as well as the threatened Finback whale,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/9366.html |title=Finback Whale Fact Sheet - Endangered |publisher=Dec.ny.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref><ref>[http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/2478/0 The ICUN red list of threatened species] - Fin Whale.</ref> and the non-endangered Bryde's whales.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090623120846.htm |title='Bycatch' whaling A Growing Threat To Coastal Whales |work=Science Daily |date=June 29, 2009 }}</ref>

The impact on J-stock whales, which have protected status under the IWC, seemingly increased with changes in Japanese regulations that legalized the sale of bycatch in 2001. Between 1997 and 2000 only 19<U+2013>29 whales were annually reported caught as bycatch. The number increased to 89 <U+2013> 137 annually between 2001 and 2004. However, the study concluded from genetic information that the actual amount of bycatch was similarly high prior to the 2001 regulations but was under-reported. Up to 46% of the samples tested proved to be J-stock.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwcoffice.org/_documents/sci_com/SCRepFiles2009/Annex%20J%20-%20Final-sq.pdf |format=PDF |title=Annex J.

Prior to the 2001 change in regulations, fishermen could not legally sell minke whales to commercial firms and were supposed to sell them locally or destroy them and report the incident. The high percentage of J-stock bycatch presents a significant threat including the possibility of extinction within a few decades according to IWC population estimates.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/47727/title/Science_%2B_the_Public__Protected_whales_found_in_Japans_supermarkets |title=Protected Whales Found In Japan<U+2019>s Supermarkets |work=Science News |date= |accessdate=2010-11-26 }}</ref>

===Imports===
In 2009 Japan accepted imports of [[whale meat]] from Norway and Iceland for the first time in over a decade. The Norwegian shipment arrived in mid-2008 but was held by Japanese customs until January 2009 when the Japan Fisheries Agency finally approved the import.

The international trade of whale meat is prohibited by [[CITES]] (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species). However, Japan, Norway and Iceland registered reservations with the treaty in order to remain exempt. The Norwegian company, Myklebust Trading, exports common minke whale and Iceland's Hvalur hf exports Fin whale, which is an endangered species. Environmental organizations criticized the trade and expressed doubts that Japanese markets could absorb the increase in supply as thousands of tonnes of whale meat remained in cold storage in Japan.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7735355.stm |work=BBC News |title=Japan approves whalemeat import |date=November 18, 2008 |first=Richard |last=Black }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2009/03/01/news/japan-resumes-imports-of-norway-whale-meat/ |title=Japan resumes imports of Norway whale meat |work=[[The Japan Times]] |date=March 1, 2009 }}</ref> In 2010, Iceland's proposed quota in killing fin whales was much larger than the amount of whale meat the Japanese market could absorb.

==Scientific research==
{{See also|Institute of Cetacean Research}}
After halting its commercial whaling, Japan began scientific research hunts to provide a basis for the resumption of sustainable whaling.<ref>{{cite web |first=Institute of Cetacean Research |authorlink= |title=Japan's research whaling in the Antarctic |url=http://www.icrwhale.org/eng/FAQResearch.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Institute of Cetacean Research |date= |accessdate=2008-02-04 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=THE JAPANESE WHALING SIMULATION |url=http://www1.american.edu/ted/class/sitewhale.htm |publisher=American University |date= |accessdate=2010-06-05 }}</ref> According to environmental groups and the Australian Environment Minister, the ostensible research serves to disguise commercial whaling in circumvention of the IWC moratorium.<ref name="timesonline.co.uk"/><ref name="bloomberg.com"/> The IWC Scientific Committee collects up-to-date data on catch limits and catches taken since 1985.

The research is conducted by the [[Institute of Cetacean Research]] (ICR), a privately owned, non-profit institution. The institute receives its funding from government subsidies and [[Kyodo Senpaku]], which handles processing and marketing of the whale meat.
Japan carries out its whaling in two areas: the North-West Pacific Ocean (JARPN II) and the [[Antarctic Ocean]] (JARPA) Southern Hemisphere catch. The 2007/08 JARPA mission had a self-imposed quota of 900 minke whales and 50 fin whales.<ref>{{cite web |title=Institute of Cetacean Research |url=http://www.icrwhale.org/eng-index.html |publisher=[[Institute of Cetacean Research]] |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 }}</ref>

On March 31, 2014 the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) stated its decision (by 12-4 votes) the Japan's whaling program was not for scientific purposes. The Court ordered that "Japan revoke any extant authorization, permit or licence to kill, take or treat whales" and refrain from granting any further permits.<ref name="outcome 2014" />

===JARPA===
The research program took place near Antarctica from 1988 to 2005. Its stated objectives were to determine mortality rates, whale stock numbers and structure, the role of whales in the Antarctic ecosystem and how environmental changes affect whales. The whaling operation alternated between several pre-established areas intending to take 400 or more minke whales per season.

In 1997 the IWC scientific committee officially reviewed the JARPA program. The committee expected reasonable precision and usefulness of the data collected but disagreed on whether lethal methods were necessary. It was also noted that the results could potentially allow for an increase in the number of minke whales annually taken.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web |title=Scientific Permit whaling: Recent SPECIFIC Scientific permits |publisher=International Whaling Commission |date=January 17, 2009 |url=http://iwc.int/conservation/permits.htm#recent }} {{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref>

In the final 2007 review the committee agreed with the initial 1997 mid assessment. It recognized that progress had been made in identifying stock structure and at least two stocks were found in the research area. Agreed estimates of abundance could not be developed and preliminary estimates may only reflect major changes in abundance over a long time line. Problems were identified with age and mortality rate data. Krill-related work was welcomed but relatively little progress was made toward understanding the role of whales in the Antarctic ecosystem. Data on pollution was also welcomed but disagreement continued over the interpretation of the results. Levels of toxic pollutants were lower in Antarctic whales than those sampled in the Northern hemisphere.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Jarpa Review: Extract from the full Report of the JARPA review workshop 2007 |publisher=International Whaling Commission |date=March 16, 2007 |url=http://iwc.int/conservation/jarpa.htm#extract }} {{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref>

The commission made note of the fact that the catches took place in the IWC established Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary and that improving management of whaling in a sanctuary is unnecessary. The 2007-1 resolution on JARPA is one of several calling on Japan by majority vote to suspend its lethal research.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="res2007-1">{{cite web |title=Resolution 2007-1: Resolution on JARPA |publisher=[[International Whaling Commission]] |date=October 30, 2007 |url=http://iwc.int/cache/downloads/2yfkueebw9essk0o8gkkw8kog/Resolution%202007.pdf |format=PDF }} {{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref>

===JARPA II===
Like its predecessor, the research whaling program takes place near Antarctica. Starting in 2005 and continuing to the present day, objectives include monitoring the Antarctic ecosystem, modeling competition between whale species, recording changes in stock structure and improving future management of Antarctic whales. The program calls for 950 minke whales, 50 fin whales and 50 humpback whales per season.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Disagreement over the value of the research, the use of lethal methods and the sample sizes continued in both the scientific committee and the commission. In 2005 and 2007 the commission passed resolutions by majority urging Japan to stop all lethal research in JARPA II.<ref name="res2007-1"/><ref name="res2005-1">{{cite web |title=Resolution 2005-1: Resolution on JARPA II |publisher=International Whaling Commission|date=June 24, 2005 |url=http://iwc.int/cache/downloads/eio6qsaqids80c8cgcocsow8o/Resolution%202005.pdf |format=PDF }} {{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref>

On March 31, 2014 the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) ruled that JARPA II was not for scientific purposes and forbade the granting of further permits.<ref name="outcome 2014" /> Following the ruling, Japan cancelled its Antarctic whaling hunt for the first time in more than 25 years, though it announced plans to propose a new research program designed to meet the standards set by the ICJ the following year.<ref>{{cite news|first1= |last1= |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=11231620 |title=Japan cancels next whaling hunt |newspaper=New Zealand Herald |date=April 3, 2014 |accessdate=2014-04-04 }}</ref>

===JARPN===
From 1994 to 1999 Japan carried out its research program JARPN in the western North Pacific. Its stated goals were to improve knowledge of stock identity, improve Implementation Simulation Trials for North Pacific Common minke whales and act as a feasibility study for a program on feeding ecology. The program called for 100 minke whales annually. The results were reviewed by committee in February, 2000. The committee agreed that the information was useful for management but no consensus was reached on whether lethal methods of research were necessary.<ref name="iwcjarpn">{{cite web |title=Scientific Permit whaling: North Pacific (1) <U+2013> JARPN |publisher=International Whaling Commission |date=September 17, 2009 |url=http://iwc.int/conservation/permits.htm#jarpn }} {{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref>

As with JARPA, the IWC issued resolutions calling for Japan to cease issuing permits for the take of minke whales citing concerns over the need for lethal methods such as the 1999-3 Resolution on whaling under Special Permit.<ref>{{cite web |title=IWC Resolution 1999-3: Resolution on whaling under Special Permit |publisher=International Whaling Commission |year=1999 |url=http://iwc.int/index.php?cID=345&cType=document&download=1 }}</ref>

===JARPN II===
JARPN II began with a feasibility study from 2000 to 2001 to continue taking whales in the western North Pacific Ocean including 100 common minke whales, 50 Bryde's whales and 10 sperm whales. The objectives of the program included study of feeding ecology (such as prey consumption), stock structure and the environmental impacts of cetaceans. In 2002 after the completion of the initial study Japan proposed and began a long-term program to study how feeding ecology relates to sustainable use in the Pacific and within Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone. In 2008 the program included a proposal for an annual take of 340 minke whales, 50 Bryde's whales, 100 sei and 10 sperm whales.<ref name="iwcjarpn"/>

Disagreement over the objectives, methodology, effect on stocks and overall success of the program continued in the scientific committee review of the feasibility study and full program. The full program introduced a change from previous use of the ICRW Article VIII research provision by not specifying an end date. The objectives were deemed unnecessary for stock management by some members and would not contribute significantly to previously identified research needs. The sample size and methods proposed were unlikely to satisfy program objectives and the ecosystem modeling was considered to be poorly developed.<ref name="iwcNPdisc">{{cite web |title=Scientific Permit whaling: Scientific committee discussions on the North Pacific permit |publisher=International Whaling Commission|date=September 17, 2009 |url=http://iwc.int/conservation/permits.htm#discussions }} {{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref>

Some contended the program placed undue emphasis on assumed negative effects of cetacean predation on fishery resources while failing to address the effects of fisheries on cetaceans. However, others believed determining the effects of cetaceans on fish stocks and more information on minke stock structure to be critically important. Some stated the feasibility study would provide valuable information on methodology and other aspects of the program would improve over time and contribute to fundamental questions. The committee identified that the pollution objective did not contribute to the goals of the IWC Pollution 2000+ project but remained relevant to the IWC for long term study.<ref name="iwcNPdisc"/>

Disagreement over the value of data obtained through lethal methods continued as well. Some argued that a wide range of questions could be answered through non-lethal means such as "for pollutant monitoring (biopsy sampling for fatty acid and stable isotope analysis), for stock structure (photo identification, biopsy sampling and faecal sampling), and for feeding ecology (faecal sampling)."<ref name="iwcNPdisc"/> Others argued that prey data was required for modeling purposes that could not be acquired through non-lethal means. However, feeding ecology was not necessarily relevant to stock management according to some who argued biopsy sampling would allow for a greater amount of statistical data.<ref name="iwcNPdisc"/>

Argument continued over the potential negative effects of catches, such as stock depletion of O-stock and J-stock whales, when the only data on many of the populations came from selective extrapolations of JSV (survey) data. Proponents contended that the JSV data was reliable and the research area extended from coastal areas to offshore areas thus limiting pressure on coastal stocks.<ref name="iwcNPdisc"/>

In 2000, 2001 and 2003 more resolutions were passed by the IWC urging Japan to cease issuing special permits for whaling and limit research to non-lethal methods.<ref name="iwcjarpn" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Resolution 2003-2: Resolution on whaling under Special Permit |publisher=International Whaling Commission |date=May 5, 2004 |url=http://iwc.int/cache/downloads/eowth0j7hbwcsss8gssscws0c/Resolution%202003.pdf |format=PDF }} {{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref> The most recent Scientific Committee review was conducted in January, 2009.<ref>{{cite conference |last1=Bj<U+00F8>rge |first1=A |last2=Butterworth |first2=D |last3=Cooke |first3=J |last4=Donovan |first4=G |last5=Forcada |first5=J |last6=Hall |first6=A |last7=Hunt |first7=G |last8=Link |first8=J |last9=Palka |first9=D |last10=Palsb<U+00F8>ll |first6=P |last11=Reilly |first11=S |last12=Skern-Mauitzen |first12=M |last13=Taro |first13=I |last14=Waples |first14=R |title=The Report of the Expert Workshop to review the ongoing JARPN II Programme |publisher=International Whaling Commission |date=January 26<U+2013>30, 2009 |location=NRIFS in Yokohama, Japan |url=http://iwc.int/cache/downloads/9m6xd1ld12osc4cg4so8ok8g8/sc-61-rep1.pdf |format=PDF }} {{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref>

In 2008, a study based on data gathered by JARPA research was published in a peer-reviewed Western academic journal, ''Polar Biology''.

==Opposition==
{{See also|Whaling controversy}}
Anti-whaling governments and groups have strongly opposed Japan's whaling program.

In 2002, the [[World Wildlife Fund]] published an open letter to the Japanese (in both Japanese and English text) in the ''[[New York Times]]'' signed by a group of international scientists, stating their assertion that "Japan's whale 'research' program fails to meet minimum standards for credible science."<ref name="nytimesletter"/> They accused Japan of "using the pretense of scientific research to evade its commitments to the world community." Signatories to the letter included [[Sylvia Earle]] (former Chief Scientist of the [[NOAA]]), Giuseppe Notarbartolo di Sciara (former President of the European Cetacean Society) and [[Roger Payne]] (founder of the [[Ocean Alliance]]).

In Volume 53, No. 3 of the journal ''[[BioScience]]'', twenty members of the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission confirmed "that the signers of the open letter correctly summarized criticisms made by researchers very familiar with Japanese scientific whaling", and that "so little of any significance to IWC management can be obtained only from whaling catches that it is impossible to justify killing animals on this basis."<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1641/0006-3568(2003)053%5B0210:WAS%5D2.0.CO;2 |title=Whaling as Science |first=Phillip J. |last=Clapham |journal=BioScience |publisher=Caliber |issue=53 |volume=3 |page=210 |year=2003 }}</ref>

A 2006 episode of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s popular science show ''[[Catalyst (TV program)|Catalyst]]'', which strongly argued against whaling, reported that of the 18 year JARPA I program, which lethally obtained samples from 6800 whales, less than 55 peer-reviewed papers were produced, of which only 14 were claimed on the program to be relevant to the goals of the JARPA program, and that only four would require lethal sampling.

The International Court of Justice ruled in March 2014 that Japan can no longer conduct its JARPA II program, rejecting the country's argument that it was for scientific purposes.<ref name="outcome 2014" /> All findings in the judgement refer specifically to the JARPA II program in the Antarctic, so the JARPN program in the NW Pacific is not affected.

===Cultural aspects===
Proponents of Japanese whaling (including the Government of Japan) often argue that it is a cultural practice which foreigners should not oppose on the basis of cultural differences.<ref name="POSIT"/> Joji Morishita of Japanese Fisheries Agency in 2001 noted that the Japanese public also feels that anti-whaling groups are covertly racist. With Norway and Iceland hunting whales on a commercial basis, according to Morishita, "Singling out [Japan's] whaling is [[cultural imperialism]] <U+2013> some people would say it's racism.

===Debate in the IWC===
{{Details|International Whaling Commission#Politics|the debate}}

The most vocal opponents of the Japanese push for a resumption of commercial whaling are Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The Australian government's stated purpose for opposing whaling is the need for conservation of endangered species; however, Japan's quota of 935 [[Minke whale]]s (which are not endangered) each year only results in a loss 0.19% of the Minke Whale's population which is more than 515,000.<ref name="Hardline" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/species/cetaceans/index.html |title=Whales, dolphins and porpoises in Australia |author=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts |authorlink= |date= |accessdate=2009-11-26 |quote=Australians have long recognised the importance of whales, dolphins and porpoises to our unique marine ecosystems, and believe that it is essential to ensure the survival of these mammals long into the future." }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icrwhale.org/eng/61JARPNResearchResults.pdf|title=JARPN/JARPN II research results}}</ref> The New Zealand government is opposed to hunting whales for food or research<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biodiversity.govt.nz/news/media/current/11jan06.html |title=NZ reiterates deep concern about whaling |author=Biodiversity Information Online |authorlink= |date=January 11, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2012-03-11 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120311003641/http://www.biodiversity.govt.nz/news/media/current/11jan06.html |quote=New Zealanders regard whales as iconic creatures and do not understand the need to kill them for scientific or any other purposes.

In July 2004 it was reported that a working group of the Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic had drawn up plans to leave the IWC in order to join a new pro-whaling organization, [[NAMMCO]], because of the IWC's refusal to back the principle of sustainable commercial whaling.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3892909.stm |work=BBC News |title=Japan plans pro-whaling alliance |date=July 14, 2004 |first=Alex |last=Kirby }}</ref> Japan is particularly opposed to the IWC Conservation Committee, introduced in 2003, which it says exists solely to prevent any whaling. Any directives from the IWC are undertaken on a purely voluntary basis as state sovereignty means that there are few avenues by which international law can be enforced.

At an [[International Whaling Commission]] (IWC) meeting in 2006, a resolution calling for the eventual return of commercial whaling was passed by a majority of just one vote. There has been a failure to lift the ban on commercial whale hunting and Japan has since threatened to leave the IWC until the whaling moratorium has ended.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,21831032-401,00.html |title=Commercial whaling ban stays |author=Staff writers |publisher=News.com.au |date=June 1, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2007-11-09 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071109095052/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,21831032-401,00.html }}</ref>

====International Court of Justice (ICJ) proceedings====
On May 31, 2010, the Australian Government lodged formal proceedings against Japan in the [[International Court of Justice|International Court of Justice (ICJ)]] in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]].<ref name="ICJ-Complaint">{{cite web |title=Application Instituting Proceedings |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/148/15951.pdf |work=Whaling in the Antarctic (Australia v Japan) |publisher=International Court of Justice |author=Commonwealth of Australia |location=[[The Hague]] |format=PDF |date=May 31, 2010 }}</ref> In a joint ministerial statement, the government stated that it "has not taken this decision lightly."

On January 5, 2011, leaked US diplomatic cables revealed that the Australian legal challenge to Japanese whaling was heavily influenced by domestic political pressures and Australian government advisers were left deeply pessimistic about the prospects of success in the International Court. In its reports to Washington, the US Embassy reported that Australian government contacts were stating that the legal proceedings "... would be unlikely to stop the whale hunt entirely, but could well force modifications that would make it more difficult for the Japanese".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/whale-watch/doomed-whaling-fight-aimed-at-saving-labor-vote-20110104-19f52.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |first=Philip |last=Dorling |title='Doomed' whaling fight aimed at saving Labor vote |date=January 5, 2011 }}</ref> The Australian public overwhelmingly supports governmental efforts to stop Japanese whaling, even at risk of losing valuable trade relations.<ref name="lowy.895">{{cite news |url=http://www.lowyinstitute.org/Publication.asp?pid=895 |first=Fergus |last=Hanson |work=The Lowy Institute |title=Poll: An International Policy Publication |year=2008 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2008-12-08 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081208085017/http://www.lowyinstitute.org/Publication.asp?pid=895 }}</ref> The New Zealand government lodged a "Declaration of Intervention" with the ICJ on February 6, 2013,<ref>{{cite web |title=Declaration of Intervention of New Zealand |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/148/17268.pdf |format=PDF |work=International Court of Justice |publisher=International Court of Justice |date=February 6, 2013 }}</ref> in which it deemed Japan as ineligible for a Special Permit that would allow whaling on the basis of scientific research.<ref name="Julia">{{cite web |title=Australia takes Japan to court on whaling <U+2013> where to now? |url=http://theconversation.com/australia-takes-japan-to-court-on-whaling-where-to-now-13481 |work=The Conversation |publisher=The Conversation Media Group |first=Tony |last=Press |first2=Julia |last2=Jabour |date=April 17, 2013 }}</ref>

As a result of the Australian government's 2010 application, a court case was heard at the ICJ. The hearing ran from June 26, 2013 until July 6, 2013. In its deposition to the ICJ, the Australian government has claimed that Japan "has breached and is continuing to breach" its obligations under the international convention, and further asserted that Japan has refused to accept International Whaling Commission (IWC) recommendations.  [[Solicitor-General of Australia]] [[Justin Gleeson]] appeared for Australia before the ICJ.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/whaling-disputes-final-phase-in-hague/story-fn3dxix6-1226670379718 |title=Barbs traded in Aust v Japan whaling case|work=The Australian|publisher=News Limited |first=Julian |last=Drape |date=June 26, 2013 }}</ref>

Tony Press, CEO of the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre at the [[University of Tasmania]], Australia, provided weekly reports of the ICJ hearings for ''The Conversation Australia'' media publication. Following the second week, Press relayed that Japan articulated in certain terms its intentions in the Southern Ocean: "the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry", further explaining that a whale must be killed to obtain certain types of information, such as the collection of ear plugs to estimate the age of a whale.

=====Outcome=====

On March 31, 2014 the ICJ ruled that Japan's whaling program was not for scientific purposes.

[[File:Anti-whaling.jpg|thumb|left|Anti-whaling protester in Melbourne, Australia, 2007]]
The Japanese whaling fleet had several clashes with anti-whaling protesters and activists from various groups,{{which|date=April 2014}} including the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]], endeavoring to follow, document and disrupt the whaling fleet since the 2005<U+2013>2006 season. On January 15, 2008 two crew members traveling on the [[MV Steve Irwin]] boarded the whaling ship ''Yushin Maru 2'' without permission and were subsequently detained on board the ship for a number of days. Japan claimed that four crew members on board a Japanese whaling ship in Antarctic waters were injured March 3, 2008 when the anti-whaling group threw [[butyric acid]] on board.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/03/japan.whaling/index.html |title=Japan: whaling ship attacked with acid |publisher=CNN |date=March 3, 2008 }}</ref>

Japan confirmed the later throwing of "flashbang" grenades onto the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society ship, [[MV Steve Irwin|MV ''Steve Irwin'']] by their whaling factory ship, ''Nisshin Maru''. Japan also confirmed firing a "warning shot" into the air. The captain of the ''Steve Irwin'', Paul Watson, claimed to have been hit in the chest by a bullet from a Japanese whaling ship crewmember, and a piece of metal was found lodged into his bullet-proof vest he was wearing at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/03/07/2183690.htm |title=Sea Shepherd captain 'shot by Japanese whalers' |date= |accessdate=2008-03-09 |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)]] }}</ref> However, the Japanese government has denied the incident, but admitted that the whalers launched "noise balls", described as "loud explosive deterrent devices".<ref>{{cite web|title=Japan denies shooting at Sea Shepherd ship|last= McLeod|first=Shane|date = March 8, 2008|publisher=ABC|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-03-07/japan-denies-shooting-at-sea-shepherd-ship/1065896?section=world |accessdate= 22 Aug 2014}}</ref>  Furthermore, the Sea Shepherd group has disclosed allegations by its members that the episode was faked to gain publicity.<ref>{{cite web|title=FULL DISCLOSURE: The Letters That Caused All This Drama |work=Sea Shepherd |date= October 6, 2010|url= http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/2010/10/06/full-disclosure-the-letters-that-caused-all-this-drama-127 |accessdate= 22 Aug 2014}}</ref>  On February 7, 2009 the MV ''Steve Irwin'' and the ''Yushin Maru No. 2'' collided as the Japanese vessel was attempting to transfer a whale.

In 2008, two Greenpeace anti-whaling activists, Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki, also called the [[Tokyo Two]] were arrested and put on trial after trying to expose what they considered a theft ring within the whaling industry. An investigation was conducted into these practices, but was shortly ended concluding that the meat was taken as a souvenir and thus legal to possess.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/whale-watch/whaling-protesters-demand-release-of-tokyo-two-20100609-xv35.html |first=Georgina |last=Robinson |title=whaling protesters demand release of Tokyo Two |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=June 9, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iP1fdxgCtWGgdqVP8awQ8J8f6l5w |title=Greenpeace protests Japan's prosecution of whale activists |agency=AFP |date=June 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2010-06-12 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100612194336/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iP1fdxgCtWGgdqVP8awQ8J8f6l5w }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2010/s2813794.htm |first=Mark |last=Willacy |title='Tokyo two' set to face trial |publisher=ABC Lateline |date=February 8, 2010 }}</ref> After his trial, Sato, Greenpeace Japan's Director of Oceans Campaign said that Greenpeace is moving away from a confrontational strategy and is using words to persuade Japan to end the hunts.<ref name=richardblack>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/richardblack/2010/06/from_the_international_whaling.html |first=Richard |last=Black |title=Food for thought from Japan's accused |publisher=BBC News |date=June 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2010-06-27 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100627173554/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/richardblack/2010/06/from_the_international_whaling.html }}</ref> He feels that outside groups do not have a good understanding of Japanese culture which can result in some actions having counter-productive results.

In January 2010, it was revealed that the Japanese whaling fleet was chartering flights in Australian planes from Hobart and Albany to track the Sea Shepherd ships' movements and provide information on their location to the whaling fleet so the fleet could evade them. The flights were heavily criticised by the Australian Greens.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/01/06/2786195.htm?site=southcoast | title=Whaling fleet's 'spy flights' flew out of Australia | work=ABC News | date=January 6, 2014 }}</ref>

On January 6, 2010, the anti-whaling ship ''[[Ady Gil]]'' suffered severe damage to its bow after a collision with the Japanese whaling ship ''[[MV Sh<U+014D>nan Maru 2|Sh<U+014D>nan Maru No. 2]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/new-zealand-australia-to-probe-whaling-protest-collision-20100106-lu7o.html |first=David |last=Brooks |title=New Zealand, Australia to probe whaling protest collision |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=January 6, 2010 }}</ref> The Ady Gil was abandoned and left to sink after it had taken on too much water to be towed.

Japan's Fisheries Agency announced on April 12, 2010 that the whaling fleet had caught about half of the 935 whales it has hoped to catch during the 2009<U+2013>2010 whaling research season as a result of obstruction by [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] protest operations. The whalers harvested 506 southern minke whales and one fin whale.<ref>[[Kyodo News]], "Whale catch cut in half by protests", ''[[Japan Times]]'', April 13, 2010, p. 2.</ref> In February 2011, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society caused Japan to call off annual whaling in Antarctic waters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/16/sea-shepherd-activists-pr_n_823884.html |title=Sea Shepherd Activists Prompt Japan to Suspend Whaling |work=Huffington Post |date=Feb 16, 2011 }}</ref>

Atsushi Ishii, Japanese political scientist and professor at [[Tohoku University]]'s Center for Northeast Asian Studies stated in his 2011 book, ''Kaitai Shinso: Hogei Ronso'' ("Anatomy of the Whaling Debate"), that Japan used the activities by conservationists like Sea Shepherd as a face-saving excuse to stop the unprofitable Antarctic hunt.  Ishii asserts that the activities of environmental and animal rights activists were actually counterproductive because they fueled nationalism and increased the demand for whale meat in Japan.  Ishii predicted that Japan would shift its whale hunting efforts to coastal waters and the Northwest Pacific.<ref name="search.japantimes" />

In December 2011, The Japanese government confirmed that US$29 million out of their supplementary post-earthquake and tsunami reconstruction budget was spent to provide extra security to ensure the "stable operation" of the Japanese whaling fleet.<ref>{{cite news |title=Japan using tsunami funds for whaling hunt |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2011-12-08/japan-whaling-tsunami/51744710/1 |newspaper=USA Today |date=December 8, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Japan says some tsunami reconstruction funds going to whaling |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/08/world/asia/japan-whaling-funds/index.html |newspaper=CNN |date=December 8, 2011 |location=Tokyo }}</ref>

On March 6, 2008 members of the [[International Whaling Commission]] met in London to discuss reaching an agreement on whale conservation rules.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/02/29/japan.whaling/index.html |title=Japan to lobby whaling commission to support hunts |publisher=CNN |date=May 28, 2008 }}</ref> Japanese whalers and anti-whaling activists clashed in the waters near [[Antarctica]] on March 7, 2008, with each side offering conflicting accounts of the confrontation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/07/japan.whaling/index.html |title=Whalers, activists clash in Antarctica |publisher=CNN |date=March 7, 2008 }}</ref> The IWC called upon the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] to refrain from dangerous actions and reiterated its condemnation of any actions that are a risk to human life and property in relation to the activities of vessels at sea.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwcoffice.org/meetings/intersession.htm |title=Statement on safety at sea |date= |publisher=IWC |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080227130150/http://www.iwcoffice.org/meetings/intersession.htm |archivedate=2008-02-27 }}</ref>

Japan has continued to face accusations of [[Vote-rigging|vote-buying]] within the IWC, as an increasing number of developing countries with little or no  tradition of whaling join.  On March 8, 2008, [[Solomon Islands]]' Prime Minister [[Derek Sikua]] said that Japan had offered to pay for his country's delegates to attend the March 6, 2008 IWC meeting in London, and that he had refused the offer.  The whaling chief at Japan's Fisheries Agency denied the allegation.  A week before that IWC meeting, Japan hosted delegates from [[Angola]], [[Cambodia]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Eritrea]], [[Ghana]], [[Laos]], [[Malawi]], [[Palau]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Vanuatu]] in Tokyo.  The delegates also visited the traditional whaling town of [[Taiji, Wakayama|Taiji]] in western Japan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gETk0rJzQZ9zMND1Dg58gAc1XKxQ |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |title=Japan denies vote-buying on whaling |date=March 7, 2008 |location=Tokyo |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2010-01-07 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100107063702/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gETk0rJzQZ9zMND1Dg58gAc1XKxQ }}</ref>

One study found levels of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] in whale red meat at 6 times the limit set by the US FDA for food. Whale meat can also be contaminated with [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s.

==2010 IWC meeting==
At the 2010 meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Morocco, representatives of the 88 member nations discussed whether or not to lift the 24 year ban on commercial whaling. Japan, Norway and Iceland have urged the organization to lift the ban. A coalition of anti-whaling nations has offered a compromise plan that would allow these countries to continue whaling, but with smaller catches and under close supervision. Their plan would also completely ban whaling in the Southern Ocean.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/world/22whale.html |first=David |last=Jolly |title=Under Pressure, Commission Discusses Lifting whaling Ban |work=New York Times |date=June 21, 2010 }}</ref> More than 200 scientists and experts have opposed the compromise proposal for lifting the ban, and have also opposed allowing whaling in the Southern Ocean, which was declared a whale sanctuary in 1994.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iPUjGuZokfP3tyEKCC8pXzfvgnVg |title=whaling ban must stay, say 200 scientists |agency=AFP |date=June 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2010-06-25 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100625062308/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iPUjGuZokfP3tyEKCC8pXzfvgnVg }}</ref>

==Media attention==
Western media attention regarding Japan's whaling industry has increased. [[Animal Planet]]'s television series, ''[[Whale Wars]]'', places a camera crew on board the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] anti-whaling activist ships to document the annual interference with Japan's Antarctic whaling program. Japan has denounced the program as deceptive and supportive of eco-terrorists to increase ratings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icrwhale.org/pdf/081106Release.pdf |format=PDF |title=Animal Planet deceives its audience with whale wars |work=Press releases |publisher=Institute of Cetacean Research |date=November 6, 2008 |deadurl=no |archivedate= |archiveurl= }}</ref> Animal Planet has made requests to also film from the perspective of Japan's whaling fleet but the requests were denied.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/outposts/2009/12/new-whale-wars-season-has-officially-begun.html |work=Los Angeles Times |title=New 'Whale Wars' season begins as Sea Shepherd seeks Japanese fleet |date=December 8, 2009 |deadurl=no |archivedate= |archiveurl= }}</ref>

The animated series ''[[South Park]]'' lampooned both Japan's whaling traditions and the anti-whaling activists featured on ''Whale Wars'' in the episode "[[Whale Whores]]".

A 2009 [[Academy Award|Oscar]] winning documentary, ''[[The Cove (film)|The Cove]]'', focused entirely on Japan's dolphin drive fisheries, mercury content of dolphin meat and the whaling town, Taiji. The film also concentrated on the difficulty in observing Taiji fishermen at work due to obstruction from the local police.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/10/24/intl.tsr.cove/index.html |publisher=CNN |title=Eco-thriller exposes dolphin capture trade |date=October 25, 2009 }}</ref>

[[Peter James Bethune]] received a two-year suspended sentence after boarding the ship which collided with his, the ''Ady Gil''.

The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported the whaling town of Ayukawa, in [[Ishinomaki, Miyagi]] was badly damaged by the [[2011 T<U+014D>hoku earthquake and tsunami]]. After the [[Fukushima Nuclear Disaster]] in 2011, [[radioactive]] [[cesium]] was found in two minke whales caught off the coast of [[Hokkaido]].<ref name=ABC20110615>{{cite web |last=Yamaguchi |first=Mari |title=Traces of Radiation Found in 2 Whales off Japan |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=13846165 |publisher=ABC News |date=June 15, 2011 |deadurl=no |archivedate=2012-01-26 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120126194411/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=13846165 }}</ref>
