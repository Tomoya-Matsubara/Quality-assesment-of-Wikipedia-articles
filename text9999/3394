The '''Bethel Woods Center for the Arts''' is a state-of-the-art performing arts center located at the site of the 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]] in [[Bethel, New York]]. The hope of its founders is to provide artists with the opportunity to play and perform on one of music<U+2019>s most legendary grounds while providing a catalyst for strong economic growth for the [[Sullivan County, New York]] area and a premier cultural destination for music lovers and concert goers.

==History==
Beginning in 1996, cable television pioneer and philanthropist Alan Gerry purchased the original festival field and 1,700 surrounding acres, with eventual plans for an arts center.  Bethel Woods is a multi-venue performing arts complex that can accommodate 15,000 fans at the main outdoor concert pavilion. 

Bethel Woods features a {{convert|7500|sqft|m2|sing=on}} stage, a 4,500 covered seat pavilion and a sloping lawn accommodating up to 10,500 people. The outdoor terrace stage has space for 1,000, and the [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] Site Festival Field can accommodate events up to 30,000 capacities.

The inaugural season of 2006 included 9 show days, while in 2007 that number was increased to 16.


==Museum at Bethel Woods==

A museum and event gallery opened in June 2008 dedicated to the legacy of the 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]] and the decade it concluded. The $100 million project, launched by the Gerry Foundation in 2004, has employed over 650 New York State laborers and artisans in every trade and skill, many from the local area. The museums is designed to preserve the historic site on which the 1969 Woodstock Music and Art Fair took place.

The interactive exhibits consist of audio/visual experiences, informative displays, and a collection of artifacts, and the permanent exhibits include: The Sixties, The Woodstock Festival, The Journey to Woodstock, Three Days of Peace and Music<U+2014>Film, Legacies of the 1960s and Woodstock.

In addition to information about the music festival, which is about two-thirds of the museum's scope,<ref name="sullico">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sc-democrat.com/news/02February/19/news.htm|title=Museum Will 'Relive' the Woodstock Era|accessdate=2008-05-23|date=2008-02-19|author=Dan Hust|work=Sullivan County Democrat}}</ref> the museum offers exhibits, personal stories and a [[multi-media]] experience about various aspects of the 1960s, including music, fashion and political protest.<ref name="buff">{{Cite web|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/405/story/338749.html|title=Bethel Woods Museum|accessdate=2008-05-23|date=2008-05-04|work=The Buffalo News}}</ref> In addition, it focuses on issues such as the [[baby boom]], [[Cold War]], [[Civil Rights Movement]], and the assassinations and riots that occurred during the decade, all of which contribute to the context of Woodstock.<ref name="hairc"/> The {{convert|7000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} museum includes a 132 seat [[High-definition video|high-definition]] theater and a {{convert|4300|sqft|m2|adj=on}} gallery, as well as classrooms, a cafe, a museum shop, and a patio.

The museum is open ten months a year.

===Funding controversy===
$1 million in funding that the museum received from the [[U.S. Senate]] in June 2007 was criticized after it was revealed the museum founder, Alan Gerry, then donated almost $30,000 to New York Senators [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Charles Schumer]], who had helped to secure the funding.<ref name="polit">{{Cite web|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071018/NEWS/710180315/-1/NEWS|title=Museum at Bethel Woods: A Political Attraction?|accessdate=2008-05-23|date=2007-10-18|author=Steve Israel|work=Times Herald-Record}}</ref> The funding was rescinded in October 2007 following criticism from [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] led by [[John McCain]],<ref name="aqua"/> although it did not affect the museum's scheduled opening<ref name="rivrep">{{Cite web|url=http://www.riverreporter.com/issues/07-10-25/head3-bethel.html|title=Senate Blocks $1 Million for Bethel Woods Museum|accessdate=2008-05-23|date=2007-10-25|author=Fritz Mayer|work=The River Reporter}}</ref> nor the more than $15 million in [[New York|state]] funding.<ref name="bbc">{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7067874.stm|title=Woodstock Museum Will Stay Open|accessdate=2008-05-23|date=2007-10-29|work=BBC News }}</ref>
