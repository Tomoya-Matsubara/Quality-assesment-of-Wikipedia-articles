'''Carl Graham Fisher''' ([[January 12]], [[1874]] -[[July 15]], [[1939]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[entrepreneur]]. Despite having severe [[astigmatism]], he became a pioneer of the [[automotive]], [[auto racing]], and [[real estate]] development industries. 

Regarded as a promotional genius for most of his life, he was a [[bicycle]] enthusiast and became involved in bicycle and later auto racing. After being injured in stunts, he helped develop paved racetracks and roadways. An [[Indiana]] native, Fisher helped organize the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], and operated what is believed to be the first [[automobile dealership]] in the [[United States]].

In [[1913]], Fisher conceived and helped develop the [[Lincoln Highway]], the first road across [[United States|America]].  He followed that in [[1914]] with the conception of the [[Dixie Highway]], which first led from Indianapolis, and eventually extended in several northern branches from the Mid-West U.S. at the Canadian borders to southern mainland [[Florida]]. Under his leadership, the initial portion was completed within a single year, and he led an automobile caravan to Florida from Indiana.  

At the south end of the Dixie Highway in [[Miami, Florida]], Fisher became involved in the successful [[real estate]] development of the new resort city of [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]], built on a largely unpopulated [[barrier island]] and reached by the new [[Collins Bridge]] across [[Biscayne Bay]] directly at the terminus of the Dixie Highway. By 1926, he was worth an estimated $100 million. His final major project, cut short by the [[Great Depression]], was a "Miami Beach of the north" at [[Montauk, New York|Montauk]], located at the eastern tip of [[Long Island]], [[New York]]. Nevertheless, years after his fortune had been lost, at the end of his career, he built the famous [[Caribbean Club]] on [[Key Largo, Florida|Key Largo]], intended as a "poor man's retreat." 

Although he lost his fortune in the [[Wall Street Crash 1929|Stock Market Crash of 1929]], and later considered himself a failure, Fisher is widely regarded as a very successful man. He was inducted into the [[Automotive Hall of Fame]] in 1971. In a 1998 study judged by a panel of 56 historians, writers, and others, Carl G. Fisher was named one of the 50 Most Influential People in the history of the State of Florida by ''The Ledger'' newspaper. [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] labeled him "Mr. Miami Beach." [[Fisher Island, Florida|Fisher Island]], one of the the wealthiest and most exclusive residential areas in the United States, just south of Miami Beach, is named for him.  

==Youth, early career, bicycles==
Carl Fisher was born in [[Greensburg, Indiana]], nine years after the end of the [[American Civil War]], the son of Albert H. and Ida Graham Fisher.  Apparently suffering from [[alcoholism]], a problem which would also plague Carl later in life, his father left the family when Fisher was a child.  Suffering from severe [[Astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]], it was difficult for Carl to pay attention in school, as uncorrected astigmatism can cause headaches or eyestrain, and blur vision at all distances. He quit school when he was twelve years old to help support his family. 

For the next five years, Fisher held a number of jobs.  He worked in a grocery and a bookstore, then later he sold [[newspaper]]s, [[tobacco]], candy, and other items on [[train]]s departing [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], a major [[railroad]] center not far from Greensburg.  He opened a [[bicycle]] repair shop in 1891 with his two brothers. A successful [[entrepreneur]], he expanded his business and became involved in [[bicycle racing]] and later, [[automobile racing]]. During his many promotional [[stunt]]s, he was frequently injured on the dirt and loose gravel roadways, leading him to become one of the early developers of automotive [[safety]] features.  A highly publicized stunt involved dropping a bicycle from the roof of the tallest building in Indianapolis, which brought on a confrontation with the police.

==Automobiles: Parts and sales==

In 1904, Carl Fisher was approached by the owner of a U.S. [[patent]] to manufacture acetylene [[headlight]]s. Soon Fisher's firm supplied nearly every headlamp used on automobiles in the United States as manufacturing plants were built all over the country to supply the demand. The headlight patent made him rich as an [[automotive]] parts supplier and led to friendships with notable auto magnates. Fisher made millions in 1909 when he sold his Prest-O-Lite automobile headlamp business to [[Union Carbide]].

Fisher also entered the business of selling automobiles (with his friend  [[Barney Oldfield]], according to the Lost Indiana website. [http://www.lostindiana.net/html/crown_hill__fisher.html]). The [[Fisher Automobile Company]] in Indianapolis is considered most likely the first [[automobile dealership]] in the United States. It carried multiple models of [[Oldsmobile]]s, [[REO Motor Car Company|Reo]]s, [[Packard]]s, [[Stoddard-Dayton]]s, [[Stutz]], and others.  Fisher staged an elaborate publicity stunt in which he attached a hot air balloon to a white [[Stoddard-Dayton]] automobile and flew the car over downtown Indianapolis.  Thousands of people observed the spectacle and Fisher triumpahntly drove back into town, becoming an instant media sensation.  Unbeknownst to the public, the flying car had its engine removed to lighten the load, and several identical cars were driven out to meet it, to allow Fisher to drive back into the city.  Afterwards, he advertised "The [[Stoddard-Dayton]] was the first automobile to fly over Indianapolis.  It should be your first automobile too."  Another stunt involved pushing a car off the roof of a building and then driving it away, to demonstrate its durability.

==Marriage & Personal Life==
In 1909 Fisher married a young woman while he was engaged to another.  Fisher's previous fiancee sued him for a breach of promise.  Meanwhile, he and his new wife Jane went on a business trip for their honeymoon.  

Fisher<U+2019>s estate in Indianapolis, <U+201C>Blossom Heath,<U+201D> was completed in 1913.  It was built on Cold Springs Road between the estates of his two friends and [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] partners, James A. Allison and Frank H. Wheeler. The house included portions of an earlier house on the site and featured a 60-foot-long Living Room with a 6-foot-wide fireplace where logs burned all day. There were twelve bedrooms and a huge glass-enclosed sun porch. Fisher built a house for his mother on the southern part of the estate. The estate also included a five-car garage, an indoor swimming pool, a polo course, a stable, an indoor tennis court and gymnasium, a greenhouse, and extensive gardens. The house was featured in a newspaper article on February 2, 1913, which described its simple dignity. Unlike the new homes of his friends and neighbors Frank Wheeler and James Allison, Fisher built a large but simple house which was decorated primarily in yellow, his favorite color. It did not contain exotic woodwork, elaborate carvings, or extensive decoration. Most of the furniture was purchased in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Fisher preferred heavy masculine furniture.  Carl was never satisfied with the placement of the garage, and had it torn down and rebuilt several times at various locations around the estate.

In 1928, after the Fishers moved permanently to [[Miami Beach]], the Fisher Estate in Indianapolis was leased to the Park School for Boys. The Park School later purchased the property. The Fisher mansion was damaged by fire in the 1950s and the rear portion of the house was demolished and replaced with a classroom wing during 1956-57. The property was sold to [[Marian College]] in the 1960s. The college combined the Wheeler, Fisher, and Allison estates into one large 110+ acre campus. 

Today the Fisher house (Fisher Hall), garage (Kavanaugh Hall), pool house (Art Annex), stable (Padua Hall), Mrs. Fisher<U+2019>s cottage (Civic Theatre Offices), and a small outbuilding remain on the [[Marian College]] campus.

==Auto racing: the "Brickyard"==
[[Image:Indianapolis Motor Speedway - loc.jpg|275px|right|thumb|early Indianapolis Motor Speedway photo ''U.S. Library of Congress'']]
In 1909, Fisher and several other Indianapolis businessmen invested in what would become the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], which is now located in [[Speedway, Indiana]]. The celebration of the first race quickly turned into a disaster due to the loose rock track. There were terrible injuries to the race car drivers and spectators. Cars caught fire, there were deaths, and the race was halted and canceled when only halfway completed.

Undeterred however, Fisher convinced the investors to pave the now famous "brickyard" track with 3.2 million paving bricks. Attracting 80,000 spectators to the first 500 mile (800 km) race on [[Memorial Day]] [[May 30]], [[1911]], at $1 admission, the Speedway reopened and hosted the first in a long line of five hundred mile (800 km) races known as the [[Indianapolis 500]].

==The Lincoln Highway==

In 1913, foreseeing the automobile's impact on American life, Carl Fisher conceived and was instrumental in the planning, development, and construction of the [[Lincoln Highway]], the first road across America, which connected [[New York City]] to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. Fisher estimated the highway, an improved, hard-surfaced road stretching almost 3,400 miles (5,472 km), would cost ten million [[United States dollar|dollars]]. Fellow [[industrialist]]s [[Frank Seiberling]] and [[Henry Bourne Joy]] helped Fisher with their promotional skills, together creating the [http://www.lincolnhighwayassoc.org Lincoln Highway Association].  Much of the highway was paid for by contributions from automobile manufacturers and suppliers, a policy bitterly opposed by [[Henry Ford]].

==The Dixie Highway==
Carl Fisher next turned his attention to creating the [[Dixie Highway]], a network of north-south routes extending from the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]] to southern [[Florida]], which he felt would provide an ideal way for residents of his home state to vacation in southern Florida. In September 1916, Fisher and [[Governor of Indiana|Indiana Governor]] [[Samuel M. Ralston]] attended a celebration opening the roadway from Indianapolis to [[Miami, Florida|Miami]].

==Miami Beach==
The future [[Miami Beach, Florida|City of Miami Beach]] became Fisher's next big project. On a vacation to Miami around 1910, he saw potential in the swampy, bug-infested stretch of land between Miami and the ocean, and in his mind transformed the 3,500 acres (14 km<U+00B2>) of [[mangrove]] swamp and beach into the perfect vacation destination for his automobile industry friends -- he called it "Miami Beach". He and his wife bought a vacation home there in 1912 and he began acquiring land. 

[[Image:N028477 Collins Bridge.jpg|287px|right|thumb|[[Collins Bridge]] across [[Biscayne Bay]] between [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] and [[Miami Beach, Florida]] opened in 1913 as the "longest wooden bridge in the world." ''photo from Florida Photographic Collection'']]
The [[Collins Bridge]] across [[Biscayne Bay]] between Miami and the [[barrier island]] that became Miami Beach was built by [[John S. Collins]] (1837-1928), an earlier farmer and developer originally from [[New Jersey]]. Collins, then 75 years old, had run out of money before he could complete his bridge. Fisher loaned him the money in trade for 200 acres (0.8 km<U+00B2>) of land. The new 2 1/2 mile (4 km) wooden [[toll bridge]] opened on [[June 12]], [[1913]]. It replaced an old [[ferry]] service and connected Miami Beach and the mainland, providing a critical link between the established city of [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] and the new town. The Collins Bridge was awarded the title of being "longest wooden bridge in the world." 

Fisher financed the dredging of [[Biscayne Bay]] to create its vast residential islands. He later built several landmark luxury [[hotel]]s including the famous [[Flamingo Hotel, Miami Beach|Flamingo Hotel]] and attracted the wealthy and celebrated to visit the community, several of whom took up permanent residence there. At the south end, he built a huge hotel-casino with Roman [[swimming pool]] and a Dutch [[windmill]]. But, while wealthy people came to vacation, only a few were buying land or building homes. The U.S. public was apparently slow to catch on to the vacation land and homes Carl envisioned for Florida. Fisher's investments at Miami Beach were not paying off, at least not until he again utilized his promotional skills which had worked so well years earlier in Indiana.

[[Image:Miami beach casino carl fisher 1922.jpg|400px|left|thumb|''Carl Fisher built a huge hotel-casino at the south end of Miami Beach, Florida'']]
Ever the innovative promoter, [[PBS]] tells of his efforts to draw attention to Miami Beach. Carl had acquired a baby [[Rosie the Elephant|elephant named "Rosie"]] who was a favorite with [[newspaper]] photographers. In 1921, he got free publicity all across the country with what we would call today a promotional "photo-op" of Rosie serving as a '[[caddy|golf caddy]]' for vacationing President-elect [[Warren Harding]]. Billboards of bathing beauties enjoying white beaches and blue ocean waters appeared around the country. Fisher even purchased a huge illuminated sign proclaiming "It's June in Miami" in [[Times Square]] in [[New York City]]. 

Real estate sales took off as Americans discovered their automobiles and the paved Dixie Highway, which through no coincidence led to the foot of the Collins Bridge. There were less than 1,000 year-round residents of Miami Beach in 1920. In the next 5 years, the resident population of the Miami Beach area grew 440%.

The art of the swap, which helped fund the Collins Bridge, was apparently the source of great satisfaction to Carl Fisher. He had bought another 200 acres (0.8 km<U+00B2>) that now form [[Fisher Island, Florida|Fisher Island]] from [[Dana A. Dorsey]], South Florida's first [[African American]] millionaire, and had begun some development there in 1919. He traded Fisher Island to [[William Kissam Vanderbilt II]] of the famous and wealthy Vanderbilt family in exchange for a 250 foot yacht in 1925. Vanderbilt used the property to create an enclave even more luxurious and exclusive than many of Miami Beach's finest. 

By 1926, Fisher was worth an estimated $100 million, and could have been financially secure for life. However, Carl Fisher was always known for moving from project to project, and success had never stopped him from attempting something new. When she had earlier hoped that he would slow down at some point, in her 1947 book, his ex-wife Jane Watts Fisher quoted him as replying "''I don't have time to take time.''"

==Montauk, Long Island==
In 1926, Fisher began working on a "Miami Beach of the north". His project at [[Montauk, New York|Montauk]] at the eastern tip of [[Long Island]] in [[New York]] was to provide a warm season counterpart to the Florida development. He and four associates purchased 9,000 acres (36 km<U+00B2>) and built a luxurious hotel, office building, marina, and attractions. The project built roads, planted nurseries, laid water pipes and built houses. 

However, a land "bust" in Florida, followed by a devastating [[1926 Miami Hurricane|hurricane in September 1926]] which wiped out much of Miami Beach, hit Fisher's investments hard, and tourism dropped off severely. His financing for the Montauk  project was dependent upon income from the Miami properties. Then, the [[Stock Market Crash of 1929]] struck, and the Montauk project went into receivership in 1932.

==Decline, final project: a poor man's retreat==
[[Image:Pr06102.jpg|300px|left|thumb|[[Caribbean Club]] in [[Key Largo, Florida]] was Fisher's last project ''1950s era photo from Florida Photographic Collection'']]
The losses in his real estate ventures and the Stock Market Crash of 1929 left Fisher virtually penniless. Always a man whose lifeblood seemed to be new dreams and projects, by the mid 1930s, he was living in a small cottage on Miami Beach and received a [[United States Dollar|US$]]500 per month salary from his former partners to do promotional work. 

Shortly before his death, as what turned out to be his last project, Fisher developed and built [[Key Largo, Florida|Key Largo]]'s [[Caribbean Club]], a [[fishing]] club for men of modest means, "a poor man's retreat." Ever the promoter, Fisher would probably have appreciated the value as about 8 years after his death, the Caribbean Club became famous as the filming site for the 1947 film ''[[Key Largo (film)|Key Largo]]'' starring [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Lauren Bacall]]. In 2006, filled with Bogart memoriablia, it is still in business as a tourist attraction.    

Carl G. Fisher died [[July 15]], [[1939]] at age 65 of a stomach hemorrhage in a Miami Beach hospital, following a lengthy illness compounded by [[alcoholism]]. He was interred at the family mausoleum in Indianapolis.

==Legacy==   
[[Image:Rc21394 monument.jpg|275px|right|thumb|Carl Graham Fisher monument at Miami Beach, Florida ''photo Florida Photographic Collection'']]  
[[Will Rogers]] remembered Carl Fisher as a Florida pioneer with these words:
:''"Fisher was the first man to discover that there was sand under the water . . . [sand] that could hold up a [[real estate]] sign. He made the dredge the national emblem of Florida."''

Howard Kleinburg, an author and Miami Beach historian described Fisher:  

:''"If you look at Fisher's entire life, it's a marathon. It's a race. It was a race to achieve the top of whatever field he was in at the time. Everything he did he went into it with his heart, his soul, his money, and he would not stop until he reached the end. He wanted to be there the quickest and first..."''

In 1947, Jane Fisher, his ex-wife (who married him in 1909 and was divorced in 1926), wrote a book about his life. ''Fabulous Hoosier'' was published by R.M. McBride and Co. She wrote:

:''"He was all speed. I don't believe he ever thought in terms of money. He made millions, but they were incidental. He often said, 'I just like to see the dirt fly.'"''

In 1971, Carl Graham Fisher was inducted into the [[Automotive Hall of Fame]].

In 1998, [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] produced a program about Carl Fisher titled ''Mr. Miami Beach'' a part of the ''American Experience'' series. The title carries such local prestige that it has been adopted by the current mayor. 

Carl Fisher's legacies include promotion and distribution of sealed beam [[headlight]] bulbs in the U.S. auto industry, his early automobile dealership, the [[Indianapolis 500]], and a national system of paved [[highway]]s in the United States which followed the trends established by the [[National Auto Trail]]s and the transcontinental east-west [[Lincoln Highway]] and the north-south [[Dixie Highway]]. 

In modern times, [[Montauk, New York|Montauk]] on the eastern tip of Long Island (with the huge Tudor-style hotel he built now a condominium project) remains a small but popular tourist destination. The [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]] area has some of the most valuable real estate in the world, home of the revitalized [[South Beach]] area with its restored art deco buildings and [[Fisher Island, Florida|Fisher Island]] at the southern tip. And, at [[Speedway, Indiana]], just outside Indianapolis, each [[Memorial Day]], the race cars still pound the famed "brickyard" at the [[Indianapolis 500]].

Today, Fisher's life story may also be regarded as an inspiration and source of hope and resourcefulness for persons with [[disability|disabilities]].
