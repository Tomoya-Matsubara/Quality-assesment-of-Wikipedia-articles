The '''Stavne<U+2013>Leangen Line''' ({{lang-no|Stavne-Leangenbanen}}) is a six kilometer long [[railway]] line in [[Trondheim]], [[Norway]]. The line leaves the [[Dovre Line]] at [[Stavne Station|Stavne]] in western Trondheim, where it crosses the river [[Nidelva]] and [[European route E6]] to the only station on the line, [[Lerkendal Station]]. The railway then goes through the 2.7 km long [[Tyholt Tunnel]] before exiting and going to [[Leangen Station|Leangen]] and joining the [[Nordland Line]] northwards east of town.

The part of the line west of Lerkendal is used by [[commuter train]]s on [[Tr<U+00F8>nderbanen]], with the station being the [[terminal station|terminus]] of the service, but the Tyholt Tunnel is not in regular use any more. The line is not electrified.

==History==
The line was constructed during [[World War II]] by the [[German occupation of Norway|German forces]] as an alternative railway outside Trondheim in case of a [[sabotage]] to the railway. But the line was not opened until 1 June 1957. On 1 December 1988 Lerkendal Station was built on the line, just beside [[Lerkendal Stadium]] and the [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Banedate '94 |author=[[Norsk Jernbaneklubb]] |date=1994 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>
