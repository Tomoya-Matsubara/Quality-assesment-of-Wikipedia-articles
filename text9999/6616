'''Judith Susan Sheindlin''' (n<U+00E9>e '''Blum'''; born October 21, 1942), better known as '''Judge Judy''', is an American lawyer, judge, television personality, and author. Since 1996, Sheindlin has presided over her own successful [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Legal/Courtroom Program|Daytime Emmy Award winning]] [[reality television#Reality court shows|reality]] [[court show|courtroom series]] named after her, ''[[Judge Judy]]''.<ref name="bio"/>

Sheindlin passed the New York [[bar examination]] in 1965, and became a [[prosecutor]] in the [[family court]] system. In 1982 Mayor [[Ed Koch]] appointed her as a judge, first in criminal court, then later as [[Manhattan]]'s supervising family court judge in 1986.

It was reported in mid-2012 that Sheindlin was the highest paid television personality, making $123,000 per episode of ''Judge Judy'',<ref name="ibtimes.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/judge-judy-sheindlin-makes-123000-day-roughly-6.46m-salary-110m-net-worth-70-year-old-850791 |title=Judge Judy Sheindlin Makes $123,000 A Day, Roughly $45M Salary And $110M Net Worth For 70-Year-Old |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2012}}</ref> or $45 million annually for the 52 days per year that she tapes her show.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-08-08/news/33104876_1_tv-guide-lea-michele-episode |title=Judge Judy rules!

==Early life and education==
Sheindlin was born '''Judith Susan Blum''' on October 21, 1942, in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]] to [[Jewish]] parents, Murray Blum, a [[dentist]] and Ethel Silverman. Her paternal grandfather, Jacob Blum, emigrated from [[Ukraine]] to the United States, while her paternal grandmother, Lena Mininberg, emigrated from [[Russia]].<ref name="bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9542275|accessdate=December 14, 2008|publisher=Biography, A&E Television Networks|title=Judith (Judge Judy) Sheindlin Biography (1942<U+2013>2010)}}</ref> She described her father as "the greatest thing since sliced bread" and her mother as "a meat and potatoes kind of gal."<ref name="guardian">{{cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/oct/09/realitytv.television|title=Judy, madly, deeply|accessdate=December 14, 2008|work=The Guardian|last=Weldon | first= Fay|date=October 9, 2008 | location=London}}</ref>

Sheindlin attended [[James Madison High School (New York)|James Madison High School]] in Brooklyn before going on to [[American University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] where she graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, majoring in government.<ref name="bio"/> She then enrolled at the [[Washington College of Law]] at American University where she was the only woman in a class of 126 students.<ref name="bio"/> She finished her law school education at [[New York Law School]], where she graduated as [[Juris Doctor]] in 1965.<ref name="judy"/>

==Legal career==
Sheindlin passed the New York [[Bar examination|bar exam]] in 1965, the same year as her graduation, and was hired as a [[corporate lawyer]] for a cosmetics firm.<ref name="bio"/> Within two years she became dissatisfied with her job and left to raise her two children. She was soon made aware of a position in the New York court system as a prosecutor in the family courts.<ref name="bio"/> In her role as a lawyer, Sheindlin prosecuted child abuse cases, domestic violence and juvenile crime.<ref name="bio"/>

By 1982, Sheindlin's no-nonsense<ref name="bio"/> attitude inspired New York Mayor [[Ed Koch]] to appoint her as a criminal court judge.<ref name="bio"/> Four years later, she was promoted to supervising judge in the family court's Manhattan division.<ref name="bio"/> She earned a reputation as a "tough" judge (though she has disagreed with the labels "tough" and "harsh"<ref name="wdrb.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/19965962/judge-judy-explains-how-she-can-tell-someone-is-lying |title=Judge Judy explains how she can tell someone is lying <U+2013> WDRB 41 Louisville <U+2013> News, Weather, Sports Community |publisher=Wdrb.com |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2012}}</ref>), known for her fast decision-making and acerbic wit.<ref name="guardian"/>

In February 1993, Sheindlin's outspoken reputation made her the subject of a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-02-14/news/vw-307_1_family-court | title=Law and Disorder | first=Josh | last=Getlin | work=Los Angeles Times | date=February 14, 1993}}</ref> profiling her as a woman determined to make the court system work for the common good.<ref name="bio"/> She subsequently was featured in a segment on CBS's ''[[60 Minutes]]'', bringing her national recognition.<ref name="bio"/> This led to her first book, ''Don't Pee on My Leg and Tell Me It's Raining'', published in 1996. She retired as a family court judge that same year after hearing over 20,000 cases.<ref name="bio"/> After her retirement, Sheindlin continued to receive increasing amounts of public attention.<ref name="bio"/>

==TV court show: ''Judge Judy''==

[[File:Judge Judy next to painting.jpg|thumb|right|Judge Judy stands next to a portrait of herself]]

===Origins===
An article about Sheindlin in the [[Los Angeles Times]] prompted a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' special on her family-court career. She was then approached about starring in a new [[reality television#Reality court shows|reality]] courtroom series, featuring "real cases with real rulings."<ref name="judy"/> She accepted the offer.

Sheindlin's ongoing [[Television syndication|syndicated]] court show, ''Judge Judy'', debuted on September 16, 1996, and will begin its 19th season on September 8, 2014.<ref name="judy">{{cite web|url=http://www.judgejudy.com/bios|title=Judge Judith Sheindlin: Presiding Judge|accessdate=November 19, 2011|publisher=CBS Studios}}</ref> Sheindlin has stated that her show's primary goal is to motivate the public to do the right thing, and to show that each individual must take responsibility for his or her actions.<ref name="wdrb.com"/>

===Ratings and reception===
''Judge Judy'' has maintained preeminence within its genre. Since its debut, it has remained the #1 rated court show<ref name="nydn"/> and regularly draws approximately 9 to 10 million viewers daily.<ref name="ppg">{{cite news|work=The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=December 24, 2008|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08359/937221-42.stm|title=There's no justice like show justice|author=Leroux, Charles|date=December 24, 2008}}</ref> During the 2009<U+2013>10 television season, ''Judge Judy'' became the first TV series in nearly a decade to attract more daytime viewers than ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Highfill |first=Samantha |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/05/02/judge-judy-renewed-2015/ |title='Judge Judy' renewed through 2015 &#124; Inside TV &#124; EW.com |publisher=Insidetv.ew.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}</ref> Since then, it has been the highest rated show in all of daytime television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/ratings/2010/09/20/judge-judy-kicks-off-15th-season-as-the-number-1-daytime-show-in-syndication-570011/20100920cbs03/ |title=Ratings <U+2013> "Judge Judy" Kicks Off 15th Season as the No. 1 Daytime Show in Syndication |publisher=TheFutonCritic.com |date=September 16, 1996 |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}</ref>

Author [[Brendan I. Koerner]] has commented on the popularity of ''Judge Judy'':

<blockquote>Court-show viewers don't seem to want moral conundrums or technical wrinkles. They love Sheindlin's show because she offers them a fantasy of how they'd like the justice system to operate<U+2014>swiftly, and without procedural mishaps or uppity lawyers. They get to see wrongdoers publicly humiliated by a strong authority figure. There is no uncertainty after Sheindlin renders her verdict and bounds off the bench, and there certainly are no lengthy appeals.<ref name="slate"/></blockquote>

A 2013 ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' poll supported Koerner's statements, revealing that [[Americans]] trusted Judge Judy more than all [[Supreme Court of the United States#Current justices|9 justices]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]].<ref name="sullivan1">{{cite news|last=Sullivan |first=Sean |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/05/17/jimmy-kimmel-asks-judge-judy-for-the-supreme-court-video/ |title=Jimmy Kimmel asks: Judge Judy for the Supreme Court?

When ET's interviewer asked Sheindlin if she thought she'd ever win the award, she replied:

::I don't know. You know, somehow it would sort of break the spell. The show has been such a tremendous success that I'm almost afraid to think about winning<U+2014>because so many of those shows that did win are no longer with us.

===Salary===
In 2005, Sheindlin's salary was US$15 million per year.<ref name="slate"/> Her [[net worth]] at the beginning of 2007 was $95 million, and she ranked number 13 on the ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine top 20 richest women in entertainment.<ref>{{cite news|title=In Pictures: The Richest 20 Women in Entertainment: Judith "Judge Judy" Sheindlin|url=http://www.forbes.com/2007/01/17/richest-women-entertainment-tech-media-cz_lg_richwomen07_0118womenstars_slide_14.html|author=Goldman, Lea and Kiri Blakeley|work=Forbes magazine|accessdate=December 23, 2008|date=January 18, 2008}}</ref> In July 2010 when Sheindlin's contract was renewed, her salary increased to $45 million per year.

===Longevity and retirement plans===
When asked why her court show has so much longevity while most other court shows do not, in the May 3, 2013, ''Entertainment Tonight'' interview, Sheindlin answered:

::I think people are comfortable knowing my perspective<U+2014>because I think if you try as a judge/television personality to do this kind of job and keep your perspectives, your personal perspectives, a secret, you're not being honest. And I think that the American viewing audience can tell when somebody's not being honest<U+2014>when somebody's peeing on their leg and telling them it's raining. I think part of the reason I was selected to do this job was because I don't filter myself very well. But I was never a great filter of myself even when I sat on the bench in New York. Now sometimes that got you into a little bit of hot water; here they seem to like it. Fortunately for me, I don't have to act. This is it. And if you annoy me, or if you lie to me, or if I feel as if you're trying to [[wikt: obfuscate|obfuscate]] the truth, you're going to get on my bad side. And that's a side that you don't want to be on.<ref name="etonline1"/>

As of the present, however, Sheindlin has stated that fans still seem to be interested and taking something out of the court show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/19965962/judge-judy-explains-how-she-can-tell-someone-is-lying |title=Judge Judy explains how she can tell someone is lying <U+2013> WDRB 41 Louisville <U+2013> News, Weather, Sports Community |publisher=Wdrb.com |date= |accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref> Sheindlin admits the court show is "seductive" and hard to give up.

As confirmed in January 2014, a new court show conceived by Sheindlin titled ''[[Hot Bench]]'' is scheduled for a fall 2014 debut. The upcoming courtroom series will feature a panel of three judges debating and deciding on cases brought to their TV courtroom. Stated Sheindlin, <U+201C>When my husband Jerry and I were in [[Ireland]] recently, we visited the courts and watched a three judge bench, which I found both fascinating and compelling. I immediately thought what a terrific and unique idea for a television program that brings the court genre to the next level. We have assembled three individuals with extremely varied backgrounds to serve as the judges. They are smart and talented, with terrific instincts and great chemistry, and are sure to create a hot bench.<U+201D> The panel of judges will consist of [[New York State Supreme Court]] judge [[Patricia DiMango]], and Los Angeles attorneys Tanya Acker and Larry Bakman. As with ''Judge Judy'', ''Hot Bench'' will be executive-produced by Randy Douthit, and produced by CBS Television Distribution.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://variety.com/2014/tv/news/judge-judy-sheindlin-to-launch-new-court-show-in-the-fall-1201068123/ |title=CBS To Launch New Courtshow From Judge Judy In Fall |publisher=Variety |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/judge-judy-created-hot-bench-premiere-fall-features-trio-of-judges |title=Judge Judy-Created 'Hot Bench' to Premiere in the Fall |publisher=TheWrap |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}</ref> It's important to note that Sheindlin originally desired the title of her personal courtroom series to be "Hot Bench" before producers ultimately settled on "Judge Judy."<ref name="cbsnews1">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500164_162-551386.h |title=Judge Judy |publisher=CBS News |date=February 11, 2009 |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/shows/judge-judy |title=Judge Judy &#124; Archive of American Television |publisher=Emmytvlegends.org |date= |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9512194705/big-ticket-sets-hot-bench |title=Big Ticket sets `Hot Bench' <U+2013> Tags: HOT Bench With Judge Judy Sheindlin (TV program) BIG Ticket Television (Company) |publisher=Connection.ebscohost.com |date= |accessdate=December 16, 2012}}</ref>

===Publications===
Sheindlin has authored six books. Her career as an author began prior to her courtroom series.

==Lawsuits==
'''Lawsuit filed by Patric Jones'''<br />
In March 2013 a [[lawsuit]] was filed against Sheindlin by Patric Jones, the estranged wife of ''Judge Judy'' executive producer Randy Douthit. Jones alleged Douthit and Sheindlin had conspired to permit Sheindlin to buy [[Christofle]] [[porcelain|fine china]] and Marley [[cutlery]] owned by Jones. She said Sheindlin had paid Douthit $50,815 for the items without her knowledge to deprive her of her valuables,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/judge-judy-sued-ex-friend-china-cutlery-sets-article-1.1289099 |title=Ex-friend of Judge Judy: I'll drop lawsuit if you give back my china set |publisher=NY Daily News |date= |accessdate=March 15, 2013 |location=New York}}</ref> and she sought $514,421 from Sheindlin. The suit was settled out of court after Sheindlin returned the tableware to Douthit and Jones agreed to pay him $12,500 and have the tableware handed back to her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2013/03/16/judge-judy-settles-china-lawsuit-producer-dishes-flatware/ |title=Judge Judy China Lawsuit SETTLES! |publisher=TMZ.com |date= |accessdate=March 16, 2013}}</ref>

'''Lawsuit filed by Judith Sheindlin'''<br />
On Wednesday, March 12, 2014, Sheindlin filed a lawsuit for the first time in her life. The suit was filed against [[Hartford, Connecticut]] [[personal injury lawyer]] John Haymond and his [[law firm]]. In the lawsuit, Sheindlin accused Haymond and his firm of using her television image without consent in [[advertisement]]s that falsely suggested she endorsed him and his firm. Sheindlin's producer allegedly told the firm that use of her image is not permitted in March 2013, but ads continued. The lawsuit filed in [[United States federal court|federal court]] sought more than $75,000 in damages. Sheindlin said in her statement that any money she wins through the lawsuit will go toward college scholarships through the Her Honor Mentoring Program. Sheindlin further stated, "Mr. Haymond is a lawyer and should know better." The unauthorized use of my name is "outrageous" and requires legal action.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2014/03/12/judge-judy-lawsuit-lawyer/ |title=Judge Judy Sues P.I.
