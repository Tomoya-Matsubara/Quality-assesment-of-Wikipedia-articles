'''Philip Arthur Larkin''', [[Order of the Companions of Honour|CH]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature|FRSL]] (9 August 1922 <U+2013> 2 December 1985) is commonly regarded as one of the greatest English poets of the latter half of the twentieth century; he was also a novelist and a [[jazz]] critic. He first came to prominence with the publication in 1955 of his second collection of poems, ''[[The Less Deceived]]'', which was followed by ''[[The Whitsun Weddings]]'' in 1964 and ''[[High Windows]]'' in 1974. He was offered but declined the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]]ship following the death of [[John Betjeman]] in 1984.

Larkin was born in the [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] of [[Coventry]]. From 1930 to 1940 he was educated at [[King Henry VIII School]] in Coventry and, in October 1940, in the midst of the [[World War II|Second World War]], he went up to [[St John's College, Oxford]] to read English language and literature. Having been rejected for military service because of his poor eyesight, he was able, unlike many of his contemporaries, to follow the traditional full-length degree course and attained a [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class honours degree]] in 1943. While at Oxford he met [[Kingsley Amis]], who became a lifelong friend and frequent correspondent. 

Shortly after graduating from Oxford, Larkin was appointed municipal librarian at [[Wellington, Shropshire]].  In 1946 he became assistant librarian at [[University of Leicester|University College, Leicester]] and, in 1950, sub-librarian at [[Queen's University Belfast]]. By this time he had published two novels and his first collection of poetry. In March 1955, Larkin was appointed Librarian at the [[University of Hull]], a position he retained until his death.

During the thirty years he spent in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], Larkin wrote the greater part of his published output. In 2003, almost two decades after his death and despite controversy about his personal life and opinions, Larkin was chosen as "the nation's best-loved poet" in a [[opinion poll|survey]] by the [[Poetry Book Society]], and in 2008 ''[[The Times]]'' named Larkin as the greatest British post-war writer.

Philip Larkin was born on 9 August 1922 in [[Coventry]], the only son and younger child of Sydney Larkin (1884<U+2013>1948), who came from [[Lichfield]], and his wife, Eva Emily Day (1886<U+2013>1977) of [[Epping]]. He lived with his family in [[Radford, Coventry|Radford]], Coventry, until he was five years old.<ref>Motion 1993, pp.<U+00A0>8,10.</ref> From 1927 to 1945 the family home was 1 Manor Road, a large three-storey detached house near the city centre that would be demolished in the 1960s to make way for Coventry's inner ring road.<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>10.</ref> His sister Catherine, known as Kitty, was 10 years older than him.<ref name="PL Society">{{cite web |url =http://www.philiplarkin.com/plbiog.html|title = Philip Larkin 1922<U+2013>1985|publisher =The Philip Larkin Society|dateformat = dmy | accessdate = 7 May 2008|first =James L|last= Orwin}}</ref> His father, a self-made man who had risen to be Coventry City Treasurer,<ref name="PL Society"/> was a singular individual who combined a love of literature with an enthusiasm for [[Nazism]], and had attended two [[Nuremberg rallies]] during the mid-'30s.<ref>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>25.</ref> He introduced his son to the works of [[Ezra Pound]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[James Joyce]] and above all [[D. H. Lawrence]].<ref>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>26.</ref> His mother was a nervous and passive woman, dominated by her husband.<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>11.</ref>

Larkin's childhood was at first unusual: neither friends nor relatives ever visited the family home, and he was educated by his mother and sister until the age of eight.<ref>Bradford 2005, pp.<U+00A0>28, 31.</ref> Despite this and the stammer he had developed, when he joined Coventry's [[King Henry VIII School|King Henry VIII]] Junior School he fitted in immediately and made close, long-standing friendships, such as those with James "Jim" Sutton, Colin Gunner and Noel "Josh" Hughes. Although home life was relatively cold, Larkin enjoyed support from his parents. For example, his deep passion for [[jazz]] was supported by the purchase of a drum kit and a [[saxophone]], supplemented with a subscription for ''[[Down Beat]]'', the first of Larkin's many jazz magazines. From the junior school he progressed to King Henry VIII Senior School. Aged 16 he fared quite poorly when he sat his [[School Certificate (UK)|School Certificate]] exam. Despite his results, however, he was allowed to stay on at school; two years later he earned distinctions in English and History, and passed the entrance exams for [[St John's College, Oxford]], to read English.<ref>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>38.</ref>

Larkin began at Oxford University in October 1940, a year after the outbreak of [[World War II]]. The [[Brideshead Revisited]] image of university life had, at least for the time being, faded, and most of the male students were studying for highly truncated degrees.<ref>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>39.</ref> Thanks to his poor eyesight, Larkin failed his military medical and was able to study for the usual three years. Through his tutorial partner, Norman Iles, he met [[Kingsley Amis]], who encouraged his taste for ridicule and irreverence and who remained a close friend throughout Larkin's life. Amis, Larkin and other university friends formed a group they dubbed "The Seven", meeting to discuss each other's poetry, listen to jazz, and drink enthusiastically. During this time he had his first real social interaction with the opposite sex, but made no romantic headway.<ref>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>59.</ref> In 1943 he sat his [[Final examination|finals]], and, having dedicated much of his time to his own writing, was greatly surprised at being awarded a [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class honours degree]].<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>104.</ref>

In autumn 1943 Larkin was appointed librarian of the public library in [[Wellington, Shropshire]].  It was while working there that in the spring of 1944 he met his first girlfriend, Ruth Bowman, an academically ambitious 16-year-old schoolgirl.<ref>Bradford 2005, pp.<U+00A0>68<U+2013>9.</ref> In autumn 1945, Ruth went to continue her studies at [[King's College London]], and during his visits to her there the couple started sexual relations. By June 1946, Larkin was halfway through qualifying for membership of the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals|Library Association]] and was appointed assistant librarian at [[University College, Leicester]]. It was visiting Larkin in Leicester and witnessing the university's [[Common room (university)|Senior Common Room]] that gave Kingsley Amis the inspiration to write ''[[Lucky Jim]]''. Six weeks after his father's death from cancer in March 1948, Larkin proposed to Ruth, and that summer the couple spent their annual holiday touring [[Thomas Hardy's Wessex|Hardy country]].<ref name="bradford70">Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>70.</ref>

===1950<U+2013>69: Personal, poetic and professional prime===
[[Image:Philip Larkin -Flat in Hull 1.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Larkin's former second-floor flat overlooking Hull's [[Pearson Park]]|alt=Larkin's former second-floor flat in Hull was part of a building of conventional red-brick construction in a residential area. It overlooked [[Pearson Park]] opposite.]]
In June 1950 Larkin was appointed sub-librarian at [[Queen's University Belfast]], a post he took up that September. Prior to his departure he and Ruth split up.<U+00A0> At some stage between his appointment to the position at Queen's and his calling off the engagement to Ruth, Larkin's relationship with [[Monica Jones]], a lecturer in English at Leicester, became sexual. He spent five years in Belfast, which appear to have been the most contented of his life. While his relationship with Monica Jones developed, he also had a sexually adventurous affair with Patsy Strang, who at the time was in an [[open marriage]] with one of his colleagues.<ref>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>100.</ref> At one stage she offered to leave her husband to marry Larkin. From summer 1951 onwards Larkin would holiday with Monica in various locations around the British Isles. While in Belfast he also had a significant though sexually undeveloped friendship with Winifred Arnott, the subject of "Lines on a Young Lady's Photograph Album". This came to a close when she married in 1954. During this period he also gave [[Kingsley Amis]] extensive advice while the latter was writing ''Lucky Jim''.<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>238.</ref> Amis repaid the debt by dedicating the finished book to Larkin.<ref>Hartley 1989, p.<U+00A0>7.</ref>

In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the [[University of Hull]], a post he would hold until his death.<ref>Motion 1993, pp.<U+00A0>244<U+2013>245</ref> For his first year he lodged in bedsits. Then in 1956, at the age of 34, he for the first time rented a self-contained dwelling, the top-floor flat of 32 Pearson Park, a three-storey red-brick house, overlooking the park, that had previously been the American Consulate.<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>276.</ref> This, it seems, was the vantage point later commemorated in the poem "[[High Windows (poem)|High Windows]]".<ref>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>154.</ref> In the post-war years Hull University underwent significant expansion, as was typical of British universities during that period. For the first 15 years of his time there, Larkin was deeply involved in all aspects of the creation of a new library<U+2014>its thoroughly modern nature at odds with the image of Larkin as a reactionary. The library was built in two stages; in 1967 it was named the [[Brynmor Jones Library]]. From 1957 until his death his secretary was Betty Mackereth. All access to him by his colleagues was through her, and she came to know as much about Larkin's compartmentalised life as anyone.<ref>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>241, ''which includes a quote from'' Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>282.</ref>

(photo 2003)|alt=The [[Brynmor Jones Library]], Hull University, consists of two buildings. The older of the two is a three-storey building of red-brick, while the newer seven-storey building linked to it is of concrete construction.]]
In February 1961 Larkin's friendship with his colleague Maeve Brennan became romantic, despite her strong Roman Catholic beliefs.<ref>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>183.</ref> In spring 1963 Brennan persuaded him to go with her to a dance for university staff, despite his preference for smaller gatherings. This seems to have been a pivotal occasion in their relationship, and he memorialised it in his longest (and unfinished) poem "The Dance".<ref>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>199.</ref> Around this time, also at her prompting, Larkin learnt to drive and bought a car. Meanwhile Monica Jones, whose parents had died in quick succession in autumn 1959, bought a holiday cottage in [[Haydon Bridge]], near [[Hexham]],<ref>Bradford 2005, pp.<U+00A0>181 & 193.</ref> which she and Larkin visited regularly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seaham.i12.com/myers/m-larkin.html |publisher=Myers Literary Guide | title = Philip Larkin (1922<U+2013>1985) |dateformat=dmy |accessdate=17 November 2008}}</ref> His notable poem "Show Saturday" is a description of the 1973 [[Bellingham, Northumberland|Bellingham]] show in the North Tyne valley.<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>437.</ref>

In 1964, in the wake of the publication of ''[[The Whitsun Weddings]]'', Larkin was the subject of an episode of the arts programme ''[[Monitor (TV series)|Monitor]]'', directed by [[Patrick Garland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orwinuk.com/silverlarkin/poster.htm|title=New Philip Larkin Poster|work=SilverLarkin|publisher=James Orwin|accessdate=13 September 2009}}</ref> The footage of his being interviewed by fellow poet [[John Betjeman]] in a series of locations in and around [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] was not insignificantly responsible for the creation of Larkin's public persona.

===1969<U+2013>85: <U+201C>Beyond the light stand failure and remorse<U+201D>===

Larkin's role in the creation of Hull University's new Brynmor Jones Library had been important and demanding. Soon after the completion of second and larger phase of construction in 1969,<ref>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>217.</ref> he was able to redirect his energies. In October 1970 he started work on compiling a new anthology, <!-- if changing the title of this book, please provide a citation -->''[[The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse]]''. He was awarded a Visiting Fellowship at [[All Souls College, Oxford]] for two academic terms, allowing him to consult Oxford's [[Bodleian Library]], a [[copyright library]]. Larkin was a major contributor to the re-evaluation of the poetry of [[Thomas Hardy]], which, in comparison to his novels, had been overlooked; in Larkin's "idiosyncratic" and "controversial" anthology,<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>407.</ref><ref name="Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>431">Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>431.</ref> Hardy was the poet most generously represented. There were twenty-seven poems by Hardy, compared with only nine by [[T. S. Eliot]]; the other poets most extensively represented were [[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]], [[W. H. Auden]] and [[Rudyard Kipling]]. Larkin included six of his own poems<U+2014>the same number as for [[Rupert Brooke]]. In the process of compiling the volume he had been disappointed not to find more and better poems as evidence that the clamour over the [[Modernists]] had stifled the voices of traditionalists.<ref name="Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>431" /> The most favourable responses to the anthology were those of [[Auden]] and [[John Betjeman]], while the most hostile was that of [[Donald Davie]], who accused Larkin of "positive cynicism" and of encouraging "the perverse triumph of philistinism, the cult of the amateur ... [and] the weakest kind of Englishry". After an initial period of anxiety about the anthology's reception, Larkin enjoyed the clamour.<ref>Bowen 2008, p.<U+00A0>107.</ref>

In 1971 Larkin regained contact with his schoolfriend Colin Gunner, who had led a picaresque life. Their subsequent correspondence has gained notoriety as in these letters "Larkin was particularly frank about political and personal opinions".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hull.ac.uk/arc/collection/philiplarkin/colls.html |title=Papers of Philip Larkin (known as the Larkin Estate Collection) |publisher=Hull University|date=2008 |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> In the period from 1973 to 1974 Larkin became an Honorary Fellow of [[St John's College, Oxford]] and was awarded [[honorary degrees]] by [[University of Warwick|Warwick]], [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]] and [[University of Sussex|Sussex]] universities. In January 1974 Hull University informed Larkin that they were going to dispose of the building on Pearson Park in which he lived. Shortly afterwards he bought a detached two-storey 1950s house in a street called Newland Park which was described by his university colleague John Kenyon as "an entirely middle-class backwater". Larkin, who moved into the house in June of that year, thought the four-bedroom property "utterly undistinguished" and reflected, "I can't say it's the kind of dwelling that is eloquent of the nobility of the human spirit".<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>440.</ref>

Doors on the first floor at the front of the house open onto a small balcony. As seen in 2008 part of the walls at the front of the house are covered with a green climbing plant, but a round commemorative plaque is clearly visible.]]

Shortly after splitting up with Maeve Brennan in August 1973, Larkin attended [[W. H. Auden]]'s memorial service at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], with Monica as his official partner.<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>438.</ref> However, in March 1975 the relationship with Maeve restarted, and three weeks after this he initiated a secret affair with his secretary Betty Mackereth, writing the long-undiscovered poem "We met at the end of the party" for her.<ref>{{cite web|first=Eric|last=McHenry|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2078368/ |title=High Standards|publisher= [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=10 February 2003 |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> Despite the logistical difficulties of having three relationships simultaneously, the situation continued until March 1978. From then on he and Monica were a monogamous couple.<ref>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>245.</ref> Five years later, in 1983, Monica was hospitalised with [[Herpes zoster|shingles]]. The severity of her symptoms, including its effects on her eyes, distressed Larkin. As her health declined, regular care became necessary: within a month she moved into his Newland Park home and remained there for the rest of her life.<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>498.</ref>

In February 1982 Larkin turned sixty. This was marked most significantly by a collection of essays entitled ''[[Larkin at Sixty]]'', edited by [[Anthony Thwaite]] and published by [[Faber and Faber]].<ref name=LarkinSixty>Thwaite 1982.</ref> There were also two television programmes: an episode of ''[[The South Bank Show]]'' presented by [[Melvyn Bragg]] in which Larkin made off-camera contributions, and a half-hour special on the BBC that was devised and presented by the Labour Shadow Cabinet Minister [[Roy Hattersley]].<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>494.</ref>

At the memorial service for [[John Betjeman]], who died in July 1984, Larkin was asked if he would accept the post of [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]]. He declined, not least because he felt he had long since ceased to be a writer of poetry in a meaningful sense.<ref>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>260.</ref> The following year Larkin began to suffer from [[oesophageal cancer]]. On 11 June 1985 he underwent surgery, but his cancer was found to have spread and was inoperable. On 28 November he collapsed and was readmitted to hospital. He died four days later, on 2 December 1985, at the age of 63, and was buried at the [[Cottingham, East Riding of Yorkshire|Cottingham]] Municipal Cemetery near [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>524.</ref> His gravestone reads simply "Philip Larkin 1922<U+2013>1985 Writer".<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Wiki Commons|author =User Keith D |title= Philip Larkin -grave stone at Cottingham Cemetery 24y08.jpg|date=2008-05-29|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Philip_Larkin_-grave_stone_at_Cottingham_Cemetery_24y08.jpg}}</ref>

On his deathbed Larkin had requested explicitly that his diaries be destroyed. This request was granted by Monica Jones and Betty Mackereth; the latter shredded the unread diaries page by page and then had them burnt.<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>522.</ref> On the subject of his other private papers and unpublished writings his will was found to be contradictory. Legal advice from a [[Q.C.]] left the issue in the lap of his literary executors, who decided the papers should not be destroyed.<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>xvi.</ref>

When she died on 15 February 2001, Monica, who had been the major beneficiary of Larkin's will, in turn left about one million pounds in total to [[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[Hexham Abbey]] and [[Durham Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite news|first=John |last=Ezard |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2002/jan/12/books.booksnews |title=Larkin's lover bequeaths to church <U+00A3>1m of poet's agnostic legacy" |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=12 January 2002 - updated 22 December 2003}}</ref>

==Creative output==
===Juvenilia===

From his mid-teens Larkin "wrote ceaselessly", producing both poetry, initially modelled on Eliot and [[W. H. Auden]], and fiction: he wrote five full-length novels, each of which he destroyed shortly after completion. While he was at Oxford University he had a poem published for the first time: "Ultimatum" in ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]''. Around this time he developed a pseudonymous alter ego for his prose, Brunette Coleman. Under this name he wrote two novellas, ''Trouble at Willow Gables'' and ''Michaelmas Term at St Brides'', as well as a supposed autobiography and an equally fictitious creative manifesto called "What we are writing for". Richard Bradford has written that these curious works show "three registers: cautious indifference, archly overwritten symbolism with a hint of Lawrence and prose that appears to disclose its writer's involuntary feelings of sexual excitement".<ref>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>51.</ref> After these works Larkin started his first published novel ''[[Jill (novel)|Jill]]''. This was published by [[Reginald Caton|Reginald A. Caton]], a publisher of barely legal pornography, who also issued serious fiction as a cover for his core activities.<ref>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>55.</ref>

Around the time that ''Jill'' was being prepared for publication, Caton inquired of Larkin if he also wrote poetry. This resulted in the publication, three months before ''Jill'', of ''[[The North Ship]]'', a collection of poems written between 1942 and 1944 which showed the increasing influence of [[William Butler Yeats|Yeats]]. Immediately after completing ''Jill'', Larkin started work on the novel ''A Girl in Winter'', completing it in 1945. This was published in 1947 by [[Faber and Faber]] and was well received, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' calling it "an exquisite performance and nearly faultless".<ref>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>77.</ref> Subsequently he made at least three concerted attempts at writing a third novel, but none went further than a solid start.<ref>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>75.</ref>

===Mature works===

It was during Larkin's five years in Belfast that he reached maturity as a poet.<ref>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>103.</ref> The bulk of his next published collection of poems ''[[The Less Deceived]]'' was written there, though eight of the twenty-nine poems included were from the late 1940s. This period also saw Larkin make his final attempts at writing prose fiction, and he gave extensive help to Kingsley Amis with ''[[Lucky Jim]]'', which was Amis's first published novel. In October 1954 an article in ''[[The Spectator]]'' made the first use of the title [[The Movement (literature)|The Movement]] to describe the dominant trend in British post-war literature.<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>242.</ref> Various poems by Larkin were included in a 1953 [[International PEN|PEN]] Anthology that also included poems by Amis and [[Robert Conquest]], and Larkin was seen to be a part of this grouping.<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>243.</ref>

In November 1955 ''[[The Less Deceived]]'' was published by The Marvell Press, an independent company in [[Hessle]] near [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. At first the volume attracted little attention, but in December it was included in ''[[The Times]]''' list of ''Books of the Year''.<ref name="motion269">Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>269.</ref> From this point the book's reputation spread and sales blossomed throughout 1956 and 1957. During his first five years in Hull the pressures of work slowed Larkin's output to an average of just two-and-a-half poems a year, but it was during this period that he wrote "[[An Arundel Tomb]]", "[[The Whitsun Weddings]]" and "Here".<ref>{{cite book |first= Philip |last=Larkin|title=Collected Poems |year=1988 |pages= 110<U+2013>11, 114<U+2013>5, 136<U+2013>7}}</ref>

In 1963 [[Faber and Faber]] reissued ''Jill'', with the addition of a long introduction by Larkin that included much information about his time at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] and his friendship with Kingsley Amis. This acted as a prelude to the release the following year of ''[[The Whitsun Weddings]]'', the volume which cemented his reputation; almost immediately after its publication he was granted a Fellowship of the [[Royal Society of Literature]]. In the years that followed Larkin wrote several of his most famous poems, followed in the 1970s by a series of longer and more sober poems, including "The Building" and "The Old Fools"<ref>{{cite book |first= Philip |last=Larkin|title=Collected Poems |year=1988|pages= 191<U+2013>3, 196<U+2013>7, 208<U+2013>9}}</ref> All of these appeared in Larkin's final collection, ''[[High Windows]]'', which was published in June 1974. Its more direct use of language meant that it did not meet with uniform praise; nonetheless it sold over twenty thousand copies in its first year alone. For some critics it represents a falling-off from his previous two books,<ref>Swarbrick 1995, pp.<U+00A0>122<U+2013>23.</ref> yet it contains a number of his much-loved pieces, including "[[This Be The Verse]]" and "The Explosion", as well as the [[High Windows (poem)|title poem]]. "Annus Mirabilis" (Year of Wonder), also from that volume, contains the frequently quoted observation that sexual intercourse began in 1963, which the narrator claims was "rather late for me": this despite Larkin having started his own sexual career in 1945. Bradford, prompted by comments in Maeve Brennan's memoir, suggests that the poem commemorates Larkin's relationship with Brennan moving from the romantic to the sexual.<ref>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>212.</ref>

Later in 1974 he started work on his final major published poem, "Aubade". It was completed in 1977 and published in the 23 December issue of ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''.<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>468.</ref> After "Aubade" Larkin wrote only one poem that has attracted close critical attention, the unpublished and intensely personal "Love Again".<ref>Bradford 2005, pp.<U+00A0>249<U+2013>251.</ref>

===Poetic style===

Larkin's poetry has been characterized as combining "an ordinary, colloquial style", "clarity", a "quiet, reflective tone", "ironic understatement" and a "direct" engagement with "commonplace experiences",<ref>Moran 2002, p.<U+00A0>151.</ref> while Jean Hartley of the Marvell Press summed his style up as a "piquant mixture of lyricism and discontent".<ref name="poetryarchive1">{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=7076 |title=Philip Larkin (1922 - 1985) |publisher=Poetryarchive.org |date=2008 |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>

Larkin's earliest work showed the influence of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[W. H. Auden|Auden]] and [[William Butler Yeats|Yeats]], and the development of his mature poetic identity in the early 1950s coincided with the growing influence on him of [[Thomas Hardy]].<ref name="bradford70"/> The "mature" Larkin style, first evident in ''[[The Less Deceived]]'', is "that of the detached, sometimes lugubrious, sometimes tender observer", who, in Jean Hartley's phrase, looks at "ordinary people doing ordinary things". Larkin's mature poetic persona is notable for its "plainness and scepticism". Other recurrent features of his mature work are sudden openings and "highly-structured but flexible verse forms".<ref name="poetryarchive1"/>
  
Terence Hawkes has argued that while most of the poems in ''[[The North Ship]]'' are "metaphoric in nature, heavily indebted to Yeats's symbolist lyrics", the subsequent development of Larkin's mature style is "not ... a movement from Yeats to Hardy, but rather a surrounding of the Yeatsian moment (the metaphor) within a Hardyesque frame". In Hawkes's view, "Larkin's poetry ... revolves around two losses": the "loss of modernism", which manifests itself as "the desire to find a moment of epiphany", and "the loss of England, or rather the loss of the British Empire, which requires England to define itself in its own terms when previously it could define 'Englishness' in opposition to something else."<ref>Hawkes 1995, p.<U+00A0>285.</ref>

In 1972 Larkin wrote the oft-quoted "Going, Going", a poem which expresses a romantic [[fatalism]] in its view of England that was typical of his later years. In it he prophesies a complete destruction of the countryside, and expresses an idealised sense of national togetherness and identity: "And that will be England gone&nbsp;... it will linger on in galleries; but all that remains for us will be concrete and tyres". The poem ends with the blunt statement, "I just think it will happen, soon."<ref>{{cite book |first= Philip |last=Larkin|title=Collected Poems |year=1988|page= 190}}</ref>

Larkin's style is bound up with his recurring themes and subjects, which include death and fatalism, as in his final major poem "Aubade".<ref>Motion 1993, pp.<U+00A0>468<U+2013>9.</ref> [[Andrew Motion]] observes of Larkin's poems that "their rage or contempt is always checked by the ... energy of their language and the satisfactions of their articulate formal control", and contrasts two aspects of his poetic personality<U+2014>on the one hand an enthusiasm for "symbolist moments" and "freely imaginative narratives", and on the other a "remorseless factuality" and "crudity of language". Motion defines this as a "life-enhancing struggle between opposites", and concludes that his poetry is typically "ambivalent": "His three mature collections have developed attitudes and styles of ... imaginative daring: in their prolonged debates with despair, they testify to wide sympathies, contain passages of frequently transcendent beauty, and demonstrate a poetic inclusiveness which is of immense consequence for his literary heirs."<ref>{{cite book|first=Andrew|last=Motion |title= Philip Larkin and Symbolism|editor-first=Stephen |editor-last =Regan |year=1997 |pages= 32, 49-50, 52-53 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|isbn=9780333604830}}</ref>

===Prose non-fiction===

Larkin was a notable critic of [[modernism]] in contemporary art and literature. His scepticism is at its most nuanced and illuminating<ref>http://www.clivejames.com/pieces/snakecharmers/larkin</ref> in ''Required Writing'', a collection of his book reviews and essays, and at its most inflamed and polemical in his introduction to his collected jazz reviews, ''All What Jazz'', drawn from the 126 record-review columns he wrote for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' between 1961 and 1971, which contains an attack on modern jazz that widens into a wholesale critique of modernism in the arts.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0403/is_n2_v42/ai_19259725/pg_4?tag=artBody;col1 |title = Larkin's Blues: Jazz and Modernism |last=Leggett |first=B.J |year = 1996 |publisher=findarticles.com}}</ref> Despite the reputation Larkin not unwillingly acquired as an enemy of modernism, recent critical assessments of Larkin's writings have identified them as possessing some modernist characteristics.<ref>Corcoran 2007, p.<U+00A0>147.</ref>

===Reception history===

When first published in 1945, ''The North Ship'' received just one review, in the ''[[Coventry Evening Telegraph]]'', which concluded "Mr Larkin has an inner vision that must be sought for with care. His recondite imagery is couched in phrases that make up in a kind of wistful hinted beauty what they lack in lucidity. Mr Larkin's readers must at present be confined to a small circle. Perhaps his work will gain wider appeal as his genius becomes more mature?"<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>132.</ref> A few years later, though, the poet and critic [[Charles Madge]] came across the book and wrote to Larkin with his compliments.<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>191.</ref> When the collection was reissued in 1966 it was presented as a work of juvenilia, and the reviews were gentle and respectful; the most forthright praise came from [[Elizabeth Jennings]] in ''[[The Spectator (1828)|The Spectator]]'': "few will question the intrinsic value of ''The North Ship'' or the importance of its being reprinted now. It is good to know that Larkin could write so well when still so young."<ref>Motion 1993, pp.<U+00A0>358<U+2013>60.</ref>

''The Less Deceived'' was first noticed by ''[[The Times]]'', who included it in its ''List of Books of 1955''. In its wake many other reviews followed; "most of them concentrated ... on the book's emotional impact and its sophisticated, witty language."<ref name="motion269"/> The ''Spectator'' felt the collection was "in the running for the best published in this country since the war"; [[George Sutherland Fraser|G. S. Fraser]], referring to Larkin's perceived association with [[The Movement (literature)|The Movement]] felt that Larkin exemplified "everything that is good in this 'new movement' and none of its faults".<ref name=Bradford144>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>144.</ref> The ''[[The Times Literary Supplement|TLS]]'' called him "a poet of quite exceptional importance",<ref name=Bradford144/> and in June 1956 the ''Times Educational Supplement'' was fulsome: "As native as a Whitstable oyster, as sharp an expression of contemporary thought and experience as anything written in our time, as immediate in its appeal as the lyric poetry of an earlier day, it may well be regarded by posterity as a poetic monument that marks the triumph over the formless mystifications of the last twenty years. With Larkin poetry is on its way back to the middlebrow public."<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>275.</ref> Reviewing the book in America the poet [[Robert Lowell]] wrote, "No post-war poetry has so caught the moment, and caught it without straining after its ephemera. It's a hesitant, groping mumble, resolutely experienced, resolutely perfect in its artistic methods."<ref name=Motion328>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>328.</ref>

However, in time, there was a counter-reaction: David Wright wrote in ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'' that ''The Less Deceived'' suffered from the "palsy of playing safe";<ref name=Bradford144/> in April 1957 [[Charles Tomlinson]] wrote a piece for the journal ''Essays in Criticism'', "The Middlebrow Muse", attacking The Movement's poets for their "middle-cum-lowbrowism", "suburban mental ratio" and "parochialism"<U+2014>Larkin had a "tenderly nursed sense of defeat".<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>281.</ref> In 1962 [[Al Alvarez|A. Alvarez]], the compiler of an anthology entitled ''[[The New Poetry]]'', famously accused Larkin of "gentility, neo-Georgian pastoralism, and a failure to deal with the violent extremes of contemporary life".<ref name=Motion328 />

When ''The Whitsun Weddings'' was released Alvarez continued his attacks in a review in ''[[The Observer]]'', complaining of the "drab circumspection" of Larkin's "commonplace" subject-matter. However, praise outweighed criticism. John Betjeman felt Larkin had "closed the gap between poetry and the public which the experiments and obscurity of the last fifty years have done so much to widen." In ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' [[Christopher Ricks]] wrote of the "refinement of self-consciousness, usually flawless in its execution" and Larkin's summoning up of "the world of all of us, the place where, in the end, we find our happiness, or not at all." He felt Larkin to be "the best poet England now has."<ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>343.</ref><ref>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0> 202.</ref>

Of the reception of ''High Windows'' Richard Bradford writes, "the reviews were generally favourable, with the notable exception of Robert Nye in ''The Times'', but each reflected the difficulty of writing a 500<U+2013>1,000-word piece on a collection which, while short, compelled fascination and confusion. The admiration for the volume was genuine for most reviewers, but one also senses anxiety in their prose, particularly on how to describe the individual genius at work in poems such as "Annus Mirabilis", "The Explosion" and "The Building" and at the same time explain why each is so radically different. Nye overcomes this problem by treating the differences as ineffective masks for a consistently nasty presence."<ref>Bradford 2005, p.<U+00A0>238</ref>

In ''[[Larkin at Sixty]]'',<ref name=LarkinSixty/> amongst the portraits by friends and colleagues such as Kingsley Amis, Noel Hughes and Charles Monteith and dedicatory poems by John Betjeman, [[Peter Porter (poet)|Peter Porter]] and [[Gavin Ewart]], the various strands of Larkin's output were analysed by critics and fellow poets: Andrew Motion, [[Christopher Ricks]] and [[Seamus Heaney]] looked at the poems, [[Alan Brownjohn]] wrote on the novels, and [[Donald Mitchell (writer)|Donald Mitchell]] and [[Clive James]] looked at his jazz criticism.<ref name=LarkinSixty/>

===Critical opinion===

In 1980 Neil Powell could write that "It is probably fair to say that Philip Larkin is less highly regarded in academic circles than either [[Thom Gunn]] or [[Donald Davie]]".<ref>Powell 1980, p.<U+00A0>83.</ref> But more recently Larkin's standing has increased. "Philip Larkin is an excellent example of the plain style in modern times," writes Tijana Stojkovic.<ref>Stojkovic 2006, p.<U+00A0>37.</ref> Robert Sheppard asserts that "It is by general consent that the work of Philip Larkin is taken to be exemplary".<ref>Sheppard 2005, p.<U+00A0>23.</ref> "Larkin is the most widely celebrated and arguably the finest poet of the Movement," states Keith Tuma, and his poetry is "more various than its reputation for dour pessimism and anecdotes of a disappointed middle class suggests".<ref>Tuma 2001, p.<U+00A0>445.</ref> 

Stephen Cooper's book ''Philip Larkin: Subversive Writer'' suggests the changing temper of Larkin studies. Cooper argues that "The interplay of signs and motifs in the early work orchestrates a subversion of conventional attitudes towards class, gender, authority and sexual relations".<ref>Cooper 2004, p.<U+00A0>1.</ref> Cooper identifies Larkin as a progressive writer, and perceives in the letters a "plea for alternative constructs of masculinity, femininity and social and political organisation".<ref>Cooper 2004, p.<U+00A0>2.</ref> Cooper draws on the entire canon of Larkin's works, as well as on unpublished correspondence, to counter the oft-repeated caricature of Larkin as a racist, misogynist reactionary. Instead he identifies in Larkin what he calls a "subversive imagination".<ref>Cooper 2004, p.<U+00A0>3.</ref> He highlights in particular "Larkin's objections to the hypocrisies of conventional sexual politics that hamper the lives of both sexes in equal measure".<ref>Cooper 2004, p.<U+00A0>179.</ref>

In similar vein to Cooper, Stephen Regan notes in an essay entitled "Philip Larkin: a late modern poet" that Larkin frequently embraces devices associated with the experimental practices of [[Modernism]], such as "linguistic strangeness, self-conscious literariness, radical self-questioning, sudden shifts of voice and register, complex viewpoints and perspectives, and symbolist intensity".<ref>Corcoran 2007, p.<U+00A0>149.</ref>

A further indication of a new direction in the critical valuation of Larkin is S. K. Chatterjee's statement that "Larkin is no longer just a name but an institution, a modern British national cultural monument".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p.<U+00A0>4.</ref> 

Chatterjee's view of Larkin is grounded in a detailed analysis of his poetic style. He notes a development from Larkin's early works to his later ones, which sees his style change from "verbal opulence through a recognition of the self-ironising and self-negating potentiality of language to a linguistic domain where the conventionally held conceptual incompatibles - which are traditional binary oppositions between absolutes and relatives, between abstracts and concretes, between fallings and risings and between singleness and multiplicity - are found to be the last stumbling-block for an artist aspiring to rise above the impasse of worldliness".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p.<U+00A0>331.</ref> This contrasts with an older view that Larkin's style barely changed over the course of his poetic career. Chatterjee identifies this view as being typified by [[Bernard Bergonzi]]'s comment that "Larkin's poetry did not ... develop between 1955 and 1974".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p.<U+00A0>14.</ref> However, for Chatterjee, Larkin's poetry responds strongly to changing "economic, socio-political, literary and cultural factors".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p.<U+00A0>18.</ref> 

Chatterjee argues that "It is under the defeatist veneer of his poetry that the positive side of Larkin's vision of life is hidden".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p.<U+00A0>356.</ref> This positivity, suggests Chatterjee, is most apparent in his later works. Over the course of Larkin's poetic career, "The most notable attitudinal development lay in the zone of his view of life, which from being almost irredeemably bleak and pessimistic in ''The North Ship'', became more and more positive with the passage of time".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p.<U+00A0>19.</ref>

The view that Larkin is not a [[nihilism|nihilist]] or [[pessimist]], but actually displays optimism in his works, is certainly not universally endorsed, but Chatterjee's lengthy study suggests the degree to which old stereotypes of Larkin are now being transcended. Representative of these stereotypes is [[Bryan Appleyard]]'s judgement (quoted by Maeve Brennan) that of the writers who "have adopted a personal pose of extreme pessimism and loathing of the world ... none has done so with quite such a grinding focus on littleness and triviality as Larkin the man".<ref name="brennan109">Brennan 2002, p.<U+00A0>109.</ref> Recent criticism of Larkin demonstrates a more complex set of values at work in his poetry and across the totality of his writings.<ref>Ingelbien 2002, p.<U+00A0>13.</ref>

The debate about Larkin is summed up by Matthew Johnson, who observes that in most evaluations of Larkin "one is not really discussing the man, but actually reading a coded and implicit discussion of the supposed values of 'Englishness' that he is held to represent".<ref>Johnson 2007, p.<U+00A0>66.</ref> Changing attitudes to Englishness are reflected in changing attitudes to Larkin, and the more sustained intellectual interest in the English national character, as embodied in the works of [[Peter Mandler]] for instance, pinpoint one key reason why there is an increased scholarly interest in Larkin.<ref>Ingelbien 2002, p.<U+00A0>196.</ref>

A summative view similar to those of Johnson and Regan is that of Robert Crawford, who argues that "In various ways, Larkin's work depends on, and develops from, Modernism." Furthermore, he "demonstrates just how slippery the word 'English' is".<ref>Crawford 2000, p.<U+00A0>276.</ref>

Despite these recent developments, Larkin and his circle are nonetheless still firmly rejected by modernist critics and poets. [[Andrew Duncan (poet)|Andrew Duncan]], writing of the [[The Movement (literature)|The Movement]], notes that "There now seems to be a very wide consensus that it was a bad thing, and that Movement poems are tedious, shallow, smug, sententious, emotionally dead, etc. Their successors in the mainstream retain most of these characteristics. Wolfgang Gortschacher's book on Little Magazine Profiles ... shows ... that there was a terrific dearth of magazines during the 50s <U+2013> an impoverishment of openings which correlates with rigid and conservative poetry, and with the hegemony of a few people determined to exclude dissidents."<ref>Notes on the poetry of the 1940s: http://www.pinko.org/108.html</ref> [[Peter Riley]], a key player in the [[British Poetry Revival]], which was a reaction against The Movement's poets, has also criticised Larkin for his uncritical and ideologically narrow position: "What after all were Larkin and The Movement but a denial of the effusive ethics of poetry from 1795 onwards, in favour of 'This is what life is really like' as if anyone thought for a second of representing observable 'life'. [[W.S. Graham]] and [[Dylan Thomas]] knew perfectly well that 'life' was like that, if you nominated it thus, which is why they went elsewhere."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jacketmagazine.com/26/rile-grah.html |title=Jacket 26 - Peter Riley reviews W.S.

===Career as a librarian===

Two of Larkin's colleagues at Hull University felt that his work as a librarian was in itself worthy of note. [[Douglas Dunn]] wrote "Librarianship became a profession through the examples set by notable librarians. Philip Larkin was such a librarian", and Brian Dyson called him "a great figure in post-war British librarianship". Having started out by running Wellington Public Library single-handed, Larkin soon developed an assurance beyond the norm. His boss at Queen's University, J.J. Graneek, said that he had "come increasingly to rely on Larkin's judgement ... I have delegated to him rather larger areas of responsibility than normally falls to the lot of a sub-librarian ... He has the ability to assess a problem, arrive at a decision and act upon it without delay, which is not too common among academic administrators."

When Larkin took up his appointment in Hull the plans for a larger university library<U+2014>the first to be built since the war<U+2014>were already far advanced. Larkin made a great effort in just a few months to come to terms with these plans before they were placed before the University Grants Committee; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were taken on board. The library was completed in 1969; ten years later Larkin took the equally ground-breaking decision to computerise records for the entire library stock. Richard Goodman has written that "with this step, Hull became the first library in Europe to install a GEAC system [an automated online circulation system]." In a general tone Goodman also wrote "it is as an administrator boss, committee man and arbitrator that Larkin revealed one of his strongest suits as a librarian. He treated his staff decently, and he motivated them. He did this with a combination of efficiency, high standards, humour and compassion. Those who have left written accounts of their time at Hull have said he was an excellent librarian and a very caring boss." In his article in ''[[Larkin at Sixty]]'' Barry Bloomfield noted that Larkin "pioneered new techniques and introduced methods which have been copied in other academic libraries in the United Kingdom." During his thirty years as Librarian the stock sextupled, and the budget expanded from <U+00A3>4,500 to <U+00A3>448,500.<ref>{{cite journal |first =Richard |last =Goodman |url =http://www.philiplarkin.com/AL/alprevious/al04con.html |title ="My particular talents": Philip Larkin's 42-year career as a Librarian| date = October 1997 |journal = The Journal About Larkin |page = 4| issue=4}}</ref>

===Posthumous reputation===

The headstone is light-grey and has a ground level built-in vase for flowers on its right side. When seen in 2008 there was a small green bush growing just to its left. The headstone is inscribed with the words "Philip Larkin  1922 <U+2013> 1985  Writer" on three lines with the dates on the middle line. It is situated in a cemetery with other gravestones.]]
Larkin's posthumous reputation was deeply affected by the publication in 1992 of [[Anthony Thwaite]]'s edition of his letters and, the following year, his official biography, ''Philip Larkin: A Writer's Life'' by [[Andrew Motion]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1991/is_n1_v52/ai_n28635043 |title = They turn on Larkin | first = Gary |last = Kissick | date = Winter 1994 | publisher = The Antioch Review}}</ref> These revealed his obsession with [[pornography]], his [[racism]], his increasing shift to the political [[right wing]], and his habitual expressions of venom and spleen. In 1990, even before the publication of these two books, [[Tom Paulin]] wrote that Larkin's "obscenity is informed by prejudices that are not by any means as ordinary, commonplace, or acceptable as the poetic language in which they are so plainly spelled out."<ref>Tom Paulin. "Into the Heart of Englishness" [[The Times Literary Supplement|TLS]] July 1990</ref> The letters and Motion's biography fueled further assessments of this kind, such as [[Lisa Jardine]]'s comment in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that "The Britishness of Larkin's poetry carries a baggage of attitudes which the ''Selected Letters'' now make explicit".<ref name="brennan109"/> On the other hand, the revelations have been dismissed by the author and critic [[Martin Amis]] in an essay included in [[The War Against Clich<U+00E9>]], arguing that the letters in particular show nothing more than a tendency for Larkin to tailor his words according to the recipient, rather than representing Larkin's true opinions. This idea is developed in Richard Bradford's biography: he compares the style Larkin used in his correspondence with the author [[Barbara Pym]] with that he adopted with his old schoolfriend Colin Gunner.<ref>Bradford 2005, pp.<U+00A0>210 & 224.</ref><ref>Motion 1993, p.<U+00A0>332.</ref>

Despite controversy about his personal life and opinions, Larkin remains one of Britain's most popular poets. In 2003, almost two decades after his death, Larkin was chosen as "the nation's best-loved poet" in a [[opinion poll|survey]] by the [[Poetry Book Society]],<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/3193692.stm "Larkin is nation's top poet"] BBC News 15 October 2003</ref> and in 2008 ''[[The Times]]'' named Larkin as the greatest British post-war writer.<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3083819.ece "The 50 greatest postwar writers"] ''[[The Times]]'', 5 January 2008.</ref> Three of his poems, "This Be The Verse", "The Whitsun Weddings" and "An Arundel Tomb", featured in the ''Nation's Top 100 Poems'' as voted for by viewers of the [[BBC]]'s ''Bookworm'' in 1995.<ref>{{cite book |author =Griff Rhys Jones (Foreword)| authorlink = Griff Rhys Jones | title = The Nation's Favourite Poems |publisher =[[BBC Books]] |year = 1996| isbn=0563384875}}</ref> Media interest in Larkin has increased in the twenty-first century.

The [[Philip Larkin Society]] was formed in 1995, ten years after the poet's death, with Anthony Thwaite, one of Larkin's [[literary executor]]s, as its president.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.philiplarkin.com/socabout.html |publisher = Philip Larkin Society |title = About the Society: Welcome |first =Edwin |last =Dawes |dateformat = dmy |accessdate = 15 November 2008}}</ref>

A booklet containing Larkin's most famous work was included with ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of 14 March 2008.

In 1964, Larkin was interviewed by Sir John Betjeman for the BBC programme ''Monitor: Philip Larkin meets John Betjeman''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/286641 |publisher =BFI | title =Film &amp; TV Database: Philip Larkin: Broadcast (1964) on [[BBC One]]}}</ref> The film, together with the original [[Dailies|rushes]], is stored at the Larkin archive at the University of Hull,<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.hull.ac.uk/arc/collection/philiplarkin/colls.html |title = Philip Larkin Subject Guide |publisher = University of Hull |dateformat = dmy |accessdate = 17 November 2008}}</ref> and was most recently broadcast on [[BBC Four]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00drs8w | title = Monitor: Larkin and Betjeman |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2008-11-11}}</ref>

In 1982, as part of celebrations for Larkin's sixtieth birthday, he was the subject of ''[[The South Bank Show]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2003/jul/05/poetry.highereducation |publisher =The Guardian |first=Andrew |last=Motion |title=A fanfare for the common man|date=5 July 2003}}</ref> Larkin did not appear on camera although [[Melvyn Bragg]], in his introduction to the programme, stressed that the poet had given his full cooperation. The programme featured contributions from Kingsley Amis, Andrew Motion and [[Alan Bennett]]. Bennett also read several of Larkin's works on an edition of ''Poetry in Motion'', broadcast by [[Channel 4]] in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/450744 |title=Poetry in Motion: Philip Larkin |publisher=British Film Institute |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>

In 2006, after lying undiscovered in a [[Hornsea]] garage for over two decades, an unprecedented collection of Larkin audio tapes was found. The recordings were made by the poet in the early 1980s, and extracts can be heard during a [[Sky News]] report.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QugmT1SEIcg |title=Philip Larkin - The Lost Tapes |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-02-02 |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> His poetry-speaking voice was very different from his normal voice, which he described as "halfway between the of drawl of Leicester and the laziness of Birmingham."

In 1999, [[Oliver Ford Davies]] starred in Ben Brown's play ''Larkin With Women'' at the [[Stephen Joseph Theatre]], Scarborough, reprising his role at the [[Orange Tree Theatre]], London in 2006. The play was published by Larkin's usual publishers, [[Faber and Faber]]. Three years later Sir [[Tom Courtenay]] debuted his one-man play ''Pretending to Be Me'' at the [[West Yorkshire Playhouse]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2146504.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Courtenay pens Larkin tribute |date =23 July 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://wyplayhouse.com/events/event_details.asp?event_ID=66 |publisher =WYPlayhouse |title =Pretending to be me |date =Staged 22 November 2002 to 21 December 2002 |author=Tom Courtenay}}</ref> later transferring the production to the [[Comedy Theatre]] in London's West End. An audio recording of the play, which is based on Larkin's letters, interviews, diaries and verse, was released in 2005.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.lrbshop.<U+00A0>co.uk/product.php?productid=1100&cat=48&page=3 |title=Pretending to be Me: Philip Larkin, a Portrait| author=Tom Courtenay| publisher = Time Warner (Audio books)| isbn= 9781405500821 |year=2005}}</ref>

In July 2003, [[BBC Two]] broadcast a play entitled ''Love Again''<U+2014>its title also that of one of Larkin's most painfully personal poems<U+2014>dealing with the last thirty years of Larkin's life (though not shot anywhere near Hull). The lead role was played by [[Hugh Bonneville]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2003/03_march/19/bbc2_springsum.shtml |title=BBC Two's summer of events|date=19 March 2003 |publisher=BBC}}</ref> and in the same year [[Channel 4]] broadcast the documentary ''Philip Larkin, Love and Death in Hull''.<ref>{{cite episode|url=http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/L/larkin/credits.html |title=Philip Larkin |network =[[Channel 4]] |airdate=2003-07-03}}</ref>

In April 2008, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a play by Chris Harrald entitled ''[[Mr Larkin's Awkward Day]]'', recounting the [[practical joke]] played on him in 1957 by his friend [[Robert Conquest]], a fellow member of the group known as [[The Movement (literature)|The Movement]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2008/apr/29/radio |title=Mr Larkin's Awkward Day}}</ref>
