'''Paul Zachary "PZ" Myers''' (born March 9, 1957) is an [[United States|American]] biology professor at the [[University of Minnesota Morris]] (UMM) and the author of the science [[blog]] [[Pharyngula (blog)|Pharyngula]].  He is currently an associate professor of [[biology]] at UMM,<ref name="facultypage">[http://www.morris.umn.edu/academic/biology/faculty.html#myers PZ Myers Biology Faculty] from [[University of Minnesota Morris]]</ref> works with [[zebrafish]] in the field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (evo-devo), and also cultivates an interest in [[cephalopod]]s. He has published numerous research papers in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] and other notable scientific journals.<ref>http://scholar.google.com/scholar?rlz=1C1SKPC_enUS362&q=PZ+Myers&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&hl=en&tab=ws</ref>

He is a public critic of [[intelligent design]] (ID) and of the [[creationist]] movement in general and is an activist in the American [[creation<U+2013>evolution controversy]]. He is widely regarded as a confrontationalist.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/16/us/16beliefs.html?_r=2|title=BELIEFS; Atheists Debate How Pushy to Be|last=Oppenheimer|first=Mark|date=2010-10-16|work=The New York Times|page=12|accessdate=2010-12-19}}</ref>

In 2006, the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' listed his blog, [[Pharyngula (blog)|Pharyngula]], as the top-ranked blog written by a scientist.<ref name="Top five science blogs">{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Top five science blogs|journal=Nature|volume=442|issue=7098|pages=9<U+2013>9|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/442009a|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v442/n7098/full/442009a.html|pmid=16823420}}</ref> Additionally, PZ Myers was the recipient of the Humanist of the Year award in 2009.

[[Asteroid]] [[153298 Paulmyers]] is named in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bluecollarscientist.com/2008/03/25/pz-myers-and-153298-paulmyers/|title=PZ Myers and (153298) Paulmyers|first=Jeff|last=Medkeff|authorlink=Jeffrey S. Medkeff|date=2008-03-25|accessdate=2008-03-25}}</ref>

==Early life==
Myers was born March 9, 1957, the eldest of six children in [[Kent, Washington]]. He was named "Paul Zachary", after his grandfather, but preferred the initials PZ to being called "Little Paul." He claims to have been a "[[science]] [[geek]]" from an early age, gaining an interest in [[zoology]] and [[marine biology]] from studying the insides of fish while on fishing trips with his father.

Myers was raised as a [[Lutheran]]. Prior to his [[confirmation]], Myers says, "I started thinking, you know, I don't believe a word of this."<ref name="mad"/> Now an [[atheist]], Myers comments widely on his blog about science, education, atheism and religion.<ref name="blight">{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/03/left_or_right_religion_and_pol.php|title=Left or Right, religion and politics don't mix|accessdate=2007-08-22|date=2006-03-13|publisher=Pharyngula|first=PZ|last=Myers }}</ref>

==Education and activism==
Myers graduated from [[Kent-Meridian High School]] in 1975,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/07/my_week_in_the_pacific_northwe.php?|title=My week in the Pacific Northwest|publisher=[[ScienceBlogs]]|date=2010-07-25|accessdate=2010-07-25|quote=Saturday at 5:00pm on I'll be attending<U+2026>my 35th high school reunion with a gang of strange people I haven't seen in decades. You aren't invited unless you were also a graduate of Kent-Meridian High School, Class of 1975}}</ref> and subsequently attended [[DePauw University]] in Indiana on a full [[scholarship]]. However, he returned home the next year after his father suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. He then attended the [[University of Washington]] in 1979 to receive a [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[zoology]]. Myers drifted away from this field toward [[evolutionary developmental biology]] and obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Biology from the [[University of Oregon]].

A self-avowed "godless [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]"<ref name=tagline>Tagline on [http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula Pharyngula]: "Evolution, development, and random biological ejaculations from a godless liberal."</ref> and outspoken [[atheist]], he is a vocal [[scientific skepticism|skeptic]] of all forms of religion, superstition, supernaturalism, spirituality and [[pseudoscience]]. He is quoted as having "nothing but contempt" for intelligent design, arguing that it is "fundamentally dishonest."<ref name="mad">{{cite journal|url=http://www.citypages.com/2005-11-23/news/the-mad-scientist/3|title=The Mad Scientist, interview with PZ Myers |date=November 23, 2005|first=Mike|last=Mosedale|volume=26|issue=1303|accessdate=2007-08-22|journal=City Pages}}</ref>

In 2009 Myers was named the [[American Humanist Association]]'s "Humanist of the Year".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanhumanist.org/What_We_Do/annual_conference/Awardees|title=2009 Humanist Awardees|publisher=American Humanist Association|accessdate=2009-03-28}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==Post-graduate career==
Myers has taught and researched at the [[University of Oregon]], the [[University of Utah]] and [[Temple University]]. He is currently an associate professor of biology at the [[University of Minnesota|University of Minnesota's]] [[Morris, Minnesota|Morris]] campus.<ref name="facultypage"/> He is a member of ''Minnesota Citizens for Science Education''.<ref>[http://www.mnscience.org/index.php?id=14 MnCSE Scientific Advisory Board] from [[Minnesota Citizens for Science Education]]</ref>

==Internet involvement==
On [[USENET]] user groups, forums, and web sites such as [[talk.origins]], Myers became involved in scientific debates, particularly those surrounding the growing [[creationism|creationist]] movement in the United States. In June 2002 he created his own Web site and blog, ''Pharyngula.org'', and he was a founding member of [[The Panda's Thumb (blog)|The Panda's Thumb]]. Since late 2005 he has been a contributor to Ask A Biologist, a science education website.

===Pharyngula===
{{Main|Pharyngula (blog)}}
Pharyngula is Myers' personal [[weblog]], promoted as "Evolution, development, and random biological ejaculations from a godless liberal."<ref name="tagline">[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/], ''Pharyngula''</ref> The topics Myers covers are eclectic, delving into the non-scientific as well as scientific. While Pharyngula includes many articles discussing breaking science news and research, the blog has become particularly well-known for ridicule of [[intelligent design]] and of attempts to insert it into science education. The blog has been ranked as the third-most-read blog maintained by a Minnesotan. Pharyngula won the 2005 [[Koufax Awards|Koufax Award]] for Best Expert Blog. The science journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' listed Pharyngula as the top-ranked blog written by a scientist.<ref name="topfiveblogs">{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v442/n7098/full/442009a.html|volume=442|issue=7098|pages=9|title=Top five science blogs|date=2006-07-05| accessdate=2009-07-15|doi=10.1038/442009a|first=Decla |last=Butler|journal=Nature|pmid=16823420}}</ref>

According to [[Alexa.com]], Pharyngula.org was started on June 19, 2002.<ref name="Alexa">{{cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=Pharyngula.org&url=pharyngula.org|title=Related Info for: pharyngula.org/|publisher=Alexa.com|accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref> It started out as an experiment in writing instruction for a class. Students were required to submit mini-essays to be published online. After the project was finished, Myers still had the web-publishing software, and started to use it himself. The blog is named after his favorite stage in [[embryonic development]], the [[pharyngula]] stage. Pharyngula moved to hosting at [[ScienceBlogs]], a project of [[Seed (magazine)|Seed Magazine]], in 2005.

On Pharyngula, Myers has repeatedly denounced the [[Discovery Institute]], [[Answers in Genesis]], and other creationist websites, as well as offering rebuttals to [[Intelligent Design]], pointing out that its claims are pseudoscientific. Other posts on Pharyngula cover a broad variety of topics that interest Myers. These include [[cephalopod]]s; science; religion (to which Myers is unequivocally opposed); local, national and international politics, particularly those involving science and/or education; superstition; and evolutionary developmental biology. Myers dismissed the Discovery Institute's petition [[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism]], stating that the scientists listed didn't have credentials relevant to [[Biology]], and that the number of them was minuscule compared to the scientific community as a whole.

On his blog in 2007, Myers reviewed [[Stuart Pivar]]'s book ''Lifecode'', which argues that self-organization at the [[embryo]]nic and [[fetus|fetal]] stages determine the development and final structure of organisms.<ref name="Lifecode at Pharyngula1">{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/07/lifecode.php|title= Lifecode|accessdate=2007-08-21|last=Myers|first=PZ|date=2007-07-12|publisher=Scienceblogs}}</ref><ref name="Lifecode at Phayngula2">{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/07/lifecode_from_egg_to_embryo_by.php|title=Lifecode: From egg to embryo by self-organization|accessdate=2007-08-21|last=Myers|first=PZ|date=2007-07-17| publisher=Scienceblogs}}</ref><ref name="Scientific American on Pivar">{{cite web|url=http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=pz_myers_scienceblogs_com_s_lead_blogger&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1|title=PZ Myers, ScienceBlogs.com's lead blogger, is being sued for libel|accessdate=2007-08-21|date=2007-08-20|publisher=Scientific American| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070823162247/http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=pz_myers_scienceblogs_com_s_lead_blogger&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1 <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=2007-08-23}}</ref> Myers reviewed the book negatively, stating that the diagrams and ideas in the book arose from Pivar's imagination and had no basis in actual evidence.
<blockquote>How his theory can be reconciled with a large body of embryological evidence that directly contradicts virtually all of it is not clear, and Pivar has chosen not to address any of it. And a book full of geometrically interesting sketches neither explains nor supports Pivar's theory.<U+2026> Theories are supposed to explain observation and experiment. You don't come up with a theory first, and then invent the evidence to support it.<ref name="Lifecode at Pharyngula1" /></blockquote>
After some discussion in the comments threads of Pharyngula, Pivar sued Myers for libel.<ref name="Lifecode at Pharyngula1"/><ref name="Scientific American on Pivar"/> Within a week Pivar withdrew the lawsuit, stating that "the real issue got sidelined" and that his problem was more with [[Seed (magazine)|Seed Media Group]].<ref name="City Pages">[http://citypages.com/databank/28/1396/article15832.asp Monkey's Uncle], ''City Pages'', September 5, 2007</ref>

In addition to articles about keeping religion out of science education, church-state separation, and complaints of misdeeds done in the name of religion, Myers continues to write about science in the disciplines of evolution,<ref name="evolution">[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/science/evolution/] ''Pharyngula: Science: evolution''</ref> palaeontology,<ref name="fossils">[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/science/fossils/], ''Pharyngula: science: fossils''</ref> genetics,<ref name="genetics">[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/science/genetics/], ''Pharyngula: science: genetics''</ref> development,<ref name="development">[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/science/development/], ''Pharyngula: science: development''</ref> and molecular biology.<ref name="molecular biology">[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/science/molecular_biology/], ''Pharyngula: science: molecular biology''</ref>

==Interview and screening of ''Expelled''==
In April 2007 Myers was interviewed for a documentary titled "Crossroads," purportedly about science and religion.<ref name="scienceblogs.com">{{cite news|first=PZ|last= Myers|title=I'm gonna be a MOVIE STAR|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/08/im_gonna_be_a_movie_star.php#more|work=|publisher=[[Pharyngula (blog)]]|date= 2007-08-22|accessdate=2008-05-28}}</ref> However in Fall 2007, executive producer [[Mark Mathis]] announced that the movie was ''[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]'' about "censorship" of intelligent design supporters.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|first=Cornelia|last=Dean|title=Scientists Feel Miscast in Film on Life's Origin|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/27/science/27expelled.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=2007-09-27|accessdate=2008-05-28}}</ref> Regarding the discrepancy of focus Myers wrote, "I mean, seriously, not telling one of the sides in a debate about what the subject might be and then leading him around randomly to various topics, with the intent of later editing it down to the parts that just make the points you want, is the video version of [[quote-mining]] and is fundamentally dishonest."<ref name="scienceblogs.com"/>

On March 20, 2008, Myers was [[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed#PZ Myers and Richard Dawkins at Minnesota pre-release screening|denied entry into a screening]] of ''[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]'' at the [[Mall of America]] in [[Minneapolis]]. He was waiting with his family and guests to attend a private screening after having reserved seats for himself and guests under his own name using the freely available online procedure set up by the film's promoters. Shortly before the film started, a security guard told him that the producer [[Mark Mathis]] had instructed that Myers be removed from the premises. After telling his family of this Myers went to a nearby Apple store and [[blog]]ged about his amusement that they had expelled him, but allowed his guest entry to see the film - British [[evolutionary biologist]] and high-profile [[anti-creationist]] and [[antitheist]] [[Richard Dawkins]], who had also been interviewed for the film under similar circumstances.<ref name=latenightquickone>{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/03/expelled.php|title=Pharyngula: EXPELLED!|accessdate=2008-03-23|first=PZ|last=Myers|date= 2008-03-20|quote=There is a rich, deep kind of irony that must be shared.

==Eucharist controversy==
{{see also|Catholic League (U.S.)#Eucharist incident}}
A controversy arose in July 2008 over a Pharyngula blog entry written by Myers expressing amazement at news reports of [[death threat]]s issued to [[University of Central Florida]] Student Senator Webster Cook. On June 29, 2008, Cook attended a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] being held in the student union at UCF by a Catholic student group that receives funding from the student government. Cook received the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Catholic Eucharist host]] but did not consume it immediately. He said later that he wanted to take it back to his seat to show a friend, but when stopped he put it in his mouth until back at his seat, then a church leader made forcible attempts to take the wafer from him.<ref name=FreethoughtRadio/><ref name="bodysnatch">{{cite web|url=http://www.wftv.com/news/16798008/detail.html|title='Body Of Christ' Snatched From Church, Held Hostage By UCF Student|accessdate=2008-07-11|date=2008-07-09|publisher=WFTV}}</ref> Cook stored the host at his home, then returned it one week later after receiving e-mail threats and pleas.<ref name=FreethoughtRadio>{{cite web|url=http://ffrf.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=361015|title=Radio interview with "Webster Cook, student senator and non-eater of communion wafers"|date=2008-07-19|format=online radio|publisher= Freethought Radio|quote=Tune in to hear the inside story about the young Orlando student whom Catholics have accused of committing a 'hate crime' for not eating a communion wafer!|accessdate=2008-07-28}}</ref><ref name=return>{{cite web|url=http://www.wftv.com/news/16806050/detail.html|title='Body Of Christ" Returned To Church After Student Receives Email Threats|accessdate=2008-07-25|date=2008-07-09|publisher=WFTV}}</ref> [[Bill Donohue]], President of the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]], described the student's actions as "beyond hate speech" and said that "All options should be on the table, including expulsion."<ref name=Don1>{{cite web|url= http://www.catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1458|title=Florida Student Abuses Eucharist|accessdate=2008-07-25|date=2008-07-07|publisher=The Catholic League}}</ref>

In his July 8 blog entry, Myers criticized the reaction to Cook's act. Myers described the level of harassment including multiple death threats leveled against the student, and accusations against the student which included [[hate crime]], [[kidnapping]], and intent to [[Host desecration|desecrate the Eucharist]] which Catholics consider a [[mortal sin]].<ref name=bodysnatch/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxorlando.com/dpp/news/Student_Who_Took_Religious_Icon_Getting_Death_Threats|title= Student Who Took Religious Icon Getting Death Threats|accessdate=2009-11-18|date=2008-07-09|first=Cheryl|last=Getuiza|publisher= My [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] Orlando}}</ref> Myers expressed outrage that [[Fox News Channel]] appeared to be inciting readers to cause further problems for the student, and ridiculed reports that armed guards would attend the next mass. Myers suggested that if any of his readers could acquire some consecrated Eucharistic hosts for him, he would treat the wafers "with profound disrespect and heinous cracker abuse, all photographed and presented here on the web."<ref name=frackincracker>{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/its_a_goddamned_cracker.php|title=IT'S A FRACKIN<U+2019> CRACKER!|accessdate=2008-07-11|date=2008-07-08|publisher=Pharyngula}}</ref>

Myers was criticized from both religious and non-religious quarters. The Catholic League accused Myers of [[anti-Catholic]] [[bigotry]],<ref name=holyheck>{{cite web|url= http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/faith/24313139.html|title=Communion wafer held 'hostage' raises holy heck|accessdate=2008-07-11|date=2008-07-11|publisher=Star Tribune}}</ref> described his proposal as a threat to desecrate what [[Transubstantiation|Catholics hold to be the Body of Christ]], and sent a letter asking the University of Minnesota and the Minnesota State Legislature to take action against Myers.<ref name="holyheck"/><ref name=pledge2>{{cite web|url= http://www.catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1459|title=Minnesota Prof Pledges to Desecrate Eucharist|accessdate=2008-07-11|date=2008-07-10|publisher=The Catholic League }}</ref> The Catholic League argued that, as the Pharyngula website was accessible via a link from the University of Minnesota's website, it should be bound by the university's code of conduct, which requires faculty to be "respectful, fair and civil" when dealing with others.<ref name="pledge2"/> Joe Foley, a member of the Board of the [[Secular Student Alliance]], wrote on the organization's website that Myers had "crossed the line" from "playful satire" to "masturbatory condescension."<ref name= SSA>[http://www.secularstudents.org/node/2168 J. Foley, "Wafergate: PZ Myers Crossed the Line"], secularstudents.org, Aug. 3, 2008</ref> Foley concluded, "if open-minded believers are willing to join us in polite dialogue, we need to be ready to welcome them with more than ridicule and pranks."<ref name= SSA/>

Subsequently, Myers explained to the ''[[Star Tribune]]'' that while his post was "satire and protest," he had received death threats regarding the incident but was not taking them too seriously.<ref name="holyheck"/>{{wikinews|Woman fired over husband's email threat to Minnesota professor|date=July 16, 2008}} In a talk show featuring Myers on ''Catholic Radio International'', hosted by Jeff Gardner, Myers confirmed that he had been sent an unspecified number of consecrated hosts and said that he intended to <U+201C>subject them to heinous cracker abuse.<U+201D> When asked by Gardner to explain why he must do so, Myers said that Donohue of the Catholic League was insisting that he acknowledge the Body of Christ in the Eucharist. Gardner pointed out that Donohue had no authority to insist on such acknowledgment. The show host then asked Myers which individual possessing the Magisterial authority of the Catholic Church had insisted that he recognize the body of Christ in the Eucharist. Myers replied that no one from the Catholic Church had contacted him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicradiointernational.com/heartofmatter.php|title=The Heart Of The Matter On Catholic Radio International|2008-07-10|work=We Need To Talk|publisher=Catholic Radio International|accessdate=2008-07-18}}</ref>

On July 24, 2008, Myers, in his post, "The Great Desecration," wrote that he had pierced through the "goddamned cracker" with a rusty nail, which he also used to pierce a few ripped-out pages of the [[Qur'an]] and ''[[The God Delusion]]'', and had simply thrown them all in the trash along with old coffee grounds and a banana peel. He provided a photograph of these items in the garbage, and wrote that nothing must be held sacred, encouraging people to question everything. In addition, he described the history of allegations of [[host desecration]], emphasizing the frequent use of such allegations in medieval Europe to justify [[anti-Semitism]].<ref name=TheGreatDesecration>{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/the_great_desecration.php|title=Pharyngula: The Great Desecration|first=PZ|last=Myers |date=2008-07-24|work=Pharyngula|publisher=[[ScienceBlogs]]|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> The following day, University of Minnesota, Morris (UMM) Chancellor stated: <U+201C>I believe that behaviors that discriminate against or harass individuals or groups on the basis of their religious beliefs are reprehensible,<U+201D> and that the school "affirms the freedom of a faculty member to speak or write as a public citizen without institutional discipline or restraint."<ref>WALSH, PAUL [http://www.startribune.com/local/25896599.html?location_refer=Homepage:latestNews:4 Morris chancellor defends instructor who defiled Eucharist, tore Qur'an] Star Tribune, July 25, 2008</ref>

==Creation Museum visit==
[[File:PZ Myers (1).jpg|thumb|Myers at the Creation Museum]]
Myers' engagement as keynote speaker at the 2009 [[Secular Student Alliance]] Conference in [[Columbus, Ohio]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Secular Student Alliance|url= http://www.secularstudents.org/conference|accessdate=2009-08-17}}</ref> developed into an August 7, 2009 trip, in which 304 attendees visited the nearby [[Creation Museum]] in [[Petersburg, Boone County, Kentucky|Petersburg, Kentucky]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A firebrand visits Creation Museum|first=Devin|last=Powell|url= http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/53237252.html|work=StarTribune.com|publisher=Star Tribune|location=Minneapolis|date=2009-08-14|accessdate=2009-08-17}}</ref> Beforehand, there was a flurry of heated blog posts which resulted in the museum sending a warning letter detailing appropriate behavior. The visit resulted in two reported incidents. In one, a student wearing a t-shirt that read, "There's probably no God. Now stop worrying and enjoy yourself"<ref>See [[Atheist Bus Campaign]]</ref> was asked to turn the shirt inside out.<ref>{{cite web|first=Devin|last=Powell|title=Creation Museum: is this how world began?|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Story?id=8280168&page=1|publisher=ABC News|date=2009-08-08|accessdate=2009-08-17}}</ref>

It was also reported that a student was asked to leave the Creation Museum after a family visiting the museum complained to staff that they saw him "laughing at the exhibits". [[Ken Ham]] however denied that the student was told to leave, claiming that a photographer who witnessed the incident was the one who was removed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blogs.answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2009/08/08/the-day-285-atheistsagnostics-visited-the-creation-museum/ | title=The Day 285 Atheists/Agnostics Visited the Creation Museum | publisher=Answers in Genesis | work=Around the World with Ken Ham | date=August 8, 2009 | accessdate=June 01, 2011 | author=Ham, Ken | quote=The bigger incident at this particular moment is recounted here by Dan Mangus, our museum<U+2019>s director, who saw much of what went on with the young man talking with me:  <U+201C>When you addressed the young man to have him apologize to the offended family, a gentleman stepped from the prof<U+2019>s mob to try to film the action and listen in. I stepped in front of his camera and informed him it was a private conversation. He kept sidestepping me and being rude about it, like I didn<U+2019>t exist, so I motioned for an officer to escort him away. Our officer said:  <U+2018>Sir, will you come with me?<U+2019>  The photographer said nothing; he just followed him.  Nothing else was said.  He escorted him to the crosswalk. That<U+2019>s when he made the comment that he hadn<U+2019>t done anything.<U+201D>  I mention this in detail because Lyz and many SSA members were (falsely) told that the young man was thrown out, and that is now being reported by bloggers, and we want to set the record straight.
