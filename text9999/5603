The '''Minoan eruption''' of [[Santorini|Thera]], around 1600 BCE, is considered to be one of the largest volcanic eruptions on Earth during the period of [[history|written human history]].<ref name="Sigurdsson">{{cite journal | quotes =  | author = Sigurdsson, H ''et al.'' | year = 2006 | title = Marine Investigations of Greece's Santorini Volcanic Field | journal = Eos | volume = 87 | issue= 34| pages = 337-348 | url = http://www.uri.edu/endeavor/thera/EOS.pdf }}</ref>  The eruption destroyed most of the island of Thera,  along with the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] towns nearby and on the coast of [[Crete]],  contributing to the collapse of the entire Minoan culture.  Additionally, the eruption caused significant climatic changes in the eastern [[Mediterranean]] region, [[Aegean Sea]] and much of the [[Northern Hemisphere]].<ref name="LaMoreaux"/>  There is also evidence that the eruption caused failure of crops in [[China]], inspired certain [[Greek myth|Greek myths]], contributed to turmoil in [[Egypt]], and influenced many of the [[Bible|biblical]] [[Exodus]] stories.

Geological evidence shows the Thera volcano erupted numerous times over the several hundred thousand years prior to the Minoan eruption.  In a repeating process, the volcano would violently erupt, then eventually collapse into a roughly circular seawater-filled [[caldera]], with numerous small islands forming the circle.  The caldera would slowly refill with magma, building a new volcano, which erupted and then collapsed in an ongoing cyclical process.<ref name="Friedrich Book">{{cite book|author=Friedrich, WL|date=1999|title=Fire in the Sea, the Santorini Volcano: Natural History and the Legend of Atlantis|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-65290-1}}</ref>

Immediately prior to the Minoan eruption, the walls of the caldera formed a nearly continuous ring of islands with the only entrance lying between Thera and the tiny island of [[Aspronisi]].<ref name="Friedrich Book"/> The cataclysmic eruption was centered on a small island just north of the existing island of [[Nea Kameni]] in the centre of the then-existing caldera. The northern part of the caldera was refilled by the volcanic ash and lava, then collapsed again.

On [[Santorini]], there is a 60&nbsp;m thick layer of white [[tephra|volcanic material fallen from the air]] that overlies the soil and therefore, clearly delineating the ground level prior to the eruption. The layer has three distinct bands that indicate the different phases of the eruption.<ref>{{cite conference| author=Davidson, DA|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Aegean Soils During the Second Millennium BCE with Reference to Thera|booktitle=Thera and the Aegean World I.

The [[plinian eruption]] resulted in an estimated 30-35&nbsp;km high [[plume]] which extended into the [[stratosphere]].  In addition, the [[magma]] underlying the volcano came into contact with the shallow marine embayment, resulting in a violent [[phreatic eruption|steam eruption]].  The event also generated a 35-150&nbsp;m high [[tsunami]] that devastated the north coast of [[Crete]], 110&nbsp;km away.  The tsunami impacted coastal towns such as [[Amnisos]], where building walls were knocked out of alignment.  On the island of [[Anafi]], 27&nbsp;km to the east, ash layers 3&nbsp;m deep have been found, as well as [[pumice]] layers on slopes 250&nbsp;m  above sea level.  Elsewhere in the Mediterranean there are pumice deposits which could have been caused by the Thera eruption.<ref>{{cite web|date=2004|url=http://baheyeldin.com/science/pumice-on-mediterranean-coast.html|title=Pumice on south Mediterranean - remnant of the Thera eruption?|accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref>  Ash layers in cores drilled from the seabed and from lakes in [[Turkey]], however, show that the heaviest ashfall was towards the east and northeast of Santorini.

There were significant climatic changes during the aftermath of the eruption.   Based on the observed changes to the [[bristlecone pines]] of [[California]]; the [[oak|bog oaks]] of [[Ireland]], [[England]], and[[ Germany]], and the [[grain crops]] of [[China]], it is believed that the plume from the eruption added sufficient particulates to the atmosphere to have reduced temperatures worldwide.<ref name="LaMoreaux"/><ref name="McCoy2002"/>

Recent archaeological research by a team of international scientists in 2006 has revealed that the Santorini event was much larger than the original estimate of 39&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> of [[Dense-Rock Equivalent]]  (DRE), or total volume of material erupted from the volcano, that was published in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uri.edu/news/releases/?id=3654|title=Santorini eruption much larger than originally believed|date=2006|accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref>  With an estimated DRE in excess of 60&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>,<ref name="Sigurdsson"/> the volume of [[ejecta]] was up to four times what was thrown into the stratosphere by [[Krakatau]] in [[1883|1883 CE]], a well-recorded event, placing the [[VEI|Volcanic Explosivity Index]] of the Thera eruption at approximately 6.  The Thera volcanic events and subsequent ashfall probably sterilized the island,  on Krakatau.  Only the [[Mount Tambora]] volcanic eruption of [[1815|1815 CE]] released more material into the atmosphere during historic times.<ref name="Oppenheimer2003">{{cite journal|last=Oppenheimer|first=Clive|title=Climatic, environmental and human consequences of the largest known historic eruption: Tambora volcano (Indonesia) 1815|journal=Progress in Physical Geography|volume=27|issue=2|date=2003|pages=230-259|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0309133303pp379ra}}</ref><ref name="McCoy2002">{{cite conference|author=McCoy, FW, & Dunn, SE|title=Modelling the Climatic Effects of the LBA Eruption of Thera:  New Calculations of Tephra Volumes May Suggest a Significantly Larger Eruption than Previously Reported|booktitle=Chapman Conference on Volcanism and the Earth's Atmosphere|url=http://www.agu.org/meetings/cc02babstracts/McCoy.pdf|publisher=American Geographical Union|date=2002|location=Thera, Greece|accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref>

==Dating==

The Minoan eruption provides a fixed point for aligning the entire chronology of the 2nd millennium BCE in the Aegean, because evidence of the eruption is found throughout the region. Despite this evidence, the exact date of the eruption has been difficult to determine. Current estimates based on [[radiocarbon dating]] indicate that the eruption occurred between [[1630 BC|1630]] and [[1600 BC|1600 BCE]].<ref>{{cite web|date=2006|url=http://www.nat.au.dk/default.asp?id=11296&la=UK|title=New research in Science: date of the largest volcanic eruption in the Bronze Age finally pinpointed|accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref>  However, this range of dates conflicts with the previous estimate of approximately [[1550 BC|1550 BCE]] based on archaeological studies utilizing [[Conventional Egyptian chronology]].<ref name="Foster"/>

Archaeologists developed the Late Bronze Age chronologies of eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] cultures by analyzing the origin of artifacts (for example, items from [[Crete]], mainland [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]] or [[Caanan]]) found in each archaeological layer.<ref name="Warren"/>  If the artifact's origin can be accurately dated, then it gives a reference date for the layer in which it is found.   If the Thera eruption could be associated with a given layer of Cretan (or other) culture, chronologists could use the date of that layer to date the eruption itself. Since Thera's culture at the time of destruction was similar to the [[Minoan civilization|Late Minoan IA]] (LMIA) culture on Crete, LMIA is the baseline to establish chronology elsewhere. The eruption also aligns with [[Cycladic civilization|Late Cycladic I]] (LCI) and [[Late Helladic|Late Helladic I]] (LHI) cultures, but predates [[Peloponnesian]] LHI.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lolos|first=YG|date=1989|url=http://www.therafoundation.org/articles/chronololy/onthelatehelladiciofakrotirithera On the Late Helladic I of Akrotiri, Thera|title=On the Late Helladic I of Akrotiri, Thera|publisher=The Thera Foundation|accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> Archeological digs on Akrotiri have also yielded fragments of nine Syro-Palestinian [[Bronze Age|Middle Bronze II]] (MBII) [[gypsum]] vessels.<ref name="Warren">{{cite book|author=Warren, PM|url=http://www.therafoundation.org/articles/chronololy/summaryofevidencefortheabsolutechronologyoftheearlypartoftheaegeanlatebronzeagederivedfromhistoricalegyptiansources|title=Summary of Evidence for the Absolute Chronology of the Early Part of the Aegean Late Bronze Age Derived from Historical Egyptian Sources in:  Thera and the Aegean World III, Hardy, DA (ed)|date=1989|publisher=The Thera Foundation|pages=24-26|accessdate=2007-03-10|isbn=0 9506133 6 3}}</ref>

At one time, it was believed that data from [[Greenland]] [[ice core]]s and [[dendrochronology|tree-ring dating]], could be useful in ascertaining the exact date of the eruption. A large eruption, identified in ice cores and dated to [[1644 BC|1644 BCE]] (+/- 20 years) was suspected to be Santorini.  Previously, it was assumed that the ice core and tree-ring data were related.  However, volcanic ash retrieved from an ice core demonstrated that this was not from Santorini, leading to the conclusion that the eruption may have occurred on another date.<ref name="Keenan">{{cite journal| last=Keenan|first=Douglas J.|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Volcanic ash retrieved from the GRIP ice core is not from Thera|journal=Geochemistry Geophysics Geosystems|volume=4|issue=11|pages=1097|publisher=AGU and the Geochemical Society|date=2003|url=http://www.informath.org/pubs/G^303a.pdf|doi=10.1029/2003GC000608|id=1525-2027|accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> The late Holocene eruption of the [[Mount Aniakchak]], a volcano in [[Alaska]], is proposed as the most likely source of the minute shards of volcanic glass in the Greenland ice core.<ref>{{cite journal | quotes =  | author = Pearce, N.

Tree-ring data showed that a large event interfering with normal tree growth in [[North America]] occurred in 1629-1628 BCE.<ref>{{cite web|last=Baillie|first=MGL|url=http://www.therafoundation.org/articles/chronololy/irishtreeringandaneventin1628bc|title=Irish Tree Rings and an Event in 1628 BC|publisher=The Thera Foundation|date=1989|accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref>  Further evidence of an eruption of Thera around [[1628 BC|1628 BCE]] was found in studies of growth depression of [[oak|European oaks]] in [[Sweden]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Grudd, H, Briffa, KR, Gunnarson, BE, & Linderholm, HW|title=Swedish tree rings provide new evidence in support of a major, widespread environmental disruption in 1628 BC|date=2000|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=27|issue=18|pages=2957-2960|doi=10.1029/1999GL010852}}</ref>

In [[2006]],  two research papers were published arguing that new radiocarbon analysis dated the eruption between [[1627 BC|1627]] and 1600 BCE.  Samples of wood, bone, and seed collected from various locations in the Aegean, including Santorini, Crete, [[Rhodes]] and [[Turkey]], were analyzed at three separate labs in [[Oxford]], [[Vienna, Austria]], and [[Heidelberg, Germany]] in order to minimise the chance of a radiocarbon dating error. Results of the analysis indicated a broad dating for the Thera event between 1660 to 1613 BCE.<ref name="Manning">{{cite journal| last=Manning|first=Sturt W|authorlink=|coauthors=Ramsey, CB, Kutschera, W,  Higham, T,  Kromer, B, Steier, P, and Wild, EM|title=Chronology for the Aegean Late Bronze Age 1700-1400 B.C.|journal=Science|volume=312|issue=5773|pages=565-569|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|date=2006|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;312/5773/565|doi=10.1126/science.1125682|id=|accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref>

The date of the eruption of Thera was recently narrowed to between 1627-1600 BCE, with a 95% probability of accuracy, after researchers analyzed material from an [[olive|olive tree]] that was found buried beneath a lava flow from the volcano.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Friedrich|first=Walter L|authorlink=|coauthors= Kromer, B, Friedrich, M, Heinemeier, J, Pfeiffer, T, and Talamo, S|title=Santorini Eruption Radiocarbon Dated to 1627-1600 B.C.|journal=Science|volume=312|issue=5773|pages=548|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|date=2006|http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;312/5773/548|doi=10.1126/science.1125087|id=|accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref>  Because the tree grew on the island, the results may have been affected by volcanic outgassing, which would have skewed the accuracy of the radiometric studies.

Although radiocarbon dating and tree-ring analysis indicate 1600 BCE eruption dating, archeologists believe that the date is contradicted by findings in Egyptian and Theran excavations.  For example, some archeologists have found buried Egyptian and Cypriot pottery on Thera that is dated to a later period than the radiometric dates for the eruption.  Since the Egyptian historical chronology has been established by numerous archeological studies, the exact date of the eruption remains controversial.  If radiocarbon dating is accurate, there would be significant chronological realignment of several Eastern Mediterranean cultures.<ref>{{cite journal|title=New Carbon Dates Support Revised History of Ancient Mediterranean|author=Balter, M|journal=Science|volume=312|issue=5773|date=2006|pages=508-509|doi=10.1126/science.312.5773.508|url=http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1622847/posts|accessdate=2007-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Wilford, JN|url=http://www.columbusdispatch.com/dispatch/contentbe/dispatch/2006/05/09/20060509-D6-01.html|title=Ancient Crete more ancient than thought?

==Historical impact==

===Minoan civilization===

According to several researchers, tsunamis casued by [[pyroclastic flow]]s and caldera collapse destroyed the navy, merchant vessels and ports of the [[Minoan Civilization|Minoans]] on the north side of Crete.  As the Minoans were a sea power and depended on their naval and merchant ships for their livelihood, the Thera eruption caused significant economic hardship to the Minoans.  Whether these effects were enough to trigger the downfall of the Minoans is under intense debate. Early research into the effect on the Minoans concluded that the ashfall from Thera on the eastern half of Crete choked off plant life, causing starvation of the local population. It was originally thought that 7-11&nbsp;cm of ash fell on Kato Zakro, while 0.5 cm fell on Knossos. However, after more thorough field examinations, this theory has lost credibility, as it has been determined that no more than 5&nbsp;mm of ash fell anywhere on Crete.<ref>{{cite book|author=Callender, G|date=1999|title=The Minoans and the Mycenaeans: Aegean Society in the Bronze Age|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn= 0195510283}}</ref><ref name="Keenan"/><ref name="LaMoreaux"/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Marinatos, S | year = 1939 | title = The Volcanic Destruction of Minoan Crete | journal = Antiquity | volume = 13 | issue =  | pages = 425-439 }}</ref><ref name="Antonopoulos ">{{cite journal|author=Antonopoulos, J.|title=The great Minoan eruption of Thera volcano and the ensuing tsunami in the Greek Archipelago|journal=Natural Hazards|volume=5|date=1992|pages=153-168|doi=10.1007/BF00127003}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Pareschi, MT, Favalli, M & Boschi, E|title=Impact of the Minoan tsunami of Santorini: Simulated scenarios in the eastern Mediterranean|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=33|page=L1860|date=2006|doi=10.1029/2006GL027205}}.</ref>

Earlier historians and archaeologists assumed that the effect on Crete was substantial because of the depth of pumice found on the sea floor near Thera. Recently, it has been established that the pumice resulted from a lateral crack in the volcano below sea level, and not directly from the eruption itself.<ref>{{cite book|author=Pichler, H & Friedrich, WL|date=1980|title=Mechanism of the Minoan Eruption of Santorini in: Thera and the Aegean World, Volume 2, C. Doumas (ed)|isbn=0950613339|publisher=Thera and the Aegean World|url=http://www.therafoundation.org/articles/volcanology/mechanismoftheminoaneruptionofsantorini|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref>  Also, significant Minoan remains have been found above the [[Minoan civilization|Late Minoan I]] era Thera ash layer, implying that the Thera eruption did not cause the immediate downfall of the Minoans.  The Mycenaean conquest of the Minoans occurred in Late Minoan II period, not many years after the eruption, and many archaeologists speculate that the eruption induced a crisis in Minoan civilization, which allowed the Mycenaeans to conquer them easily.<ref name="Antonopoulos "/>

===Chinese records===
Some scientists correlate a volcanic winter from the Minoan eruption with Chinese records documenting the collapse of the [[Xia dynasty]] in [[China]].  According to the [[Bamboo Annals]], the collapse of the dynasty and the rise of the [[Shang dynasty]], approximately dated to [[1618 BC|1618 BCE]], were accompanied by "'yellow fog, a dim sun, then three suns, frost in July, famine, and the withering of all five cereals".<ref name="Foster">{{cite journal|author=Foster, KP, Ritner, RK, and Foster, BR|date=1996|title=Texts, Storms, and the Thera Eruption|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|volume=55|issue=1|pages=1-14}}</ref><ref name="LaMoreaux"/>

===Impact on Egyptian history===
There are no surviving Egyptian records of the eruption, and the absence of such records is sometimes attributed to the general disorder in Egypt around the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]].  However, there are connections between the Thera eruption and the calamities of the [[Ipuwer papyrus|Admonitions of Ipuwer]], a text from Lower Egypt during the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] or [[Second Intermediate Period]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Galanopoulos|first=Angelos Georgiou|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Atlantis: The Truth Behind the Legend|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill Co|date=1969|location=|pages=|url=|doi=|isbn=978-0672506109}}</ref>

Heavy rainstorms which devastated much of Egypt, and were described on the [[Tempest Stele]] of [[Ahmose I]], have been attributed to short term climatic changes caused by the Theran eruption.<ref>{{cite web|first=Davis|last=EN|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=A Storm in Egypt during the Reign of Ahmose|work=Thera and the Aegean World III|publisher=Thera Foundation|date=1990|url=http://www.therafoundation.org/articles/chronololy/astorminegyptduringthereignofahmose|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Goedicke|first=Hans|authorlink=|coauthors=|title='Studies about Kamose and Ahmose'|publisher=David Brown Book Company|date=1995|location=Baltimore|pages=Chapter 3|url=|doi=|isbn= 0-9613805-8-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| author=Foster, KP & Ritner, RK|title=Texts, Storms, and the Theran Eruption|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|volume=57|issue=|pages=1-14|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1996|url=|doi=|id=|accessdate=}}</ref>  This theory is not supported by current archaeological evidence which show no pumice layers at Avaris or elsewhere in Lower Egypt during the reigns of Ahmose I and [[Thutmosis III]]. While it has been argued that the damage from this storm may have been caused by an earthquake following the Thera Eruption, it has also been suggested that it was caused during a war with the [[Hyksos]], and the storm reference is merely a metaphor for chaos, upon which the Pharaoh was attempting to impose order.<ref name="Wiener">{{cite journal| last=Wiener|first=MH|authorlink=|coauthors=Allen, JP|title=Separate Lives: The Ahmose Tempest Stela and the Theran Eruption|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|volume=57|issue=|pages=1-28|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1998|url=|doi=|id=|accessdate=}}</ref>

There is a consensus that Egypt, being far away from areas of significant [[seismic]] activity, would not be significantly affected by an earthquake in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].  Furthermore, other documents, such as [[Hatshepsut]]'s [[Speos Armedios]], depict similar storms, but are clearly speaking figuratively, not literally.  Research indicates that this particular stele is just another reference to the Pharaoh overcoming the powers of chaos and darkness.<ref name="Wiener"/>

===Greek traditions===
The eruption of Thera and volcanic fallout inspired myths of the [[Titanomachy]] in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]''.  The background of the Titanomachy is known to derive from the [[Kumarbi]] cycle, a [[Bronze Age]] [[Hurrian]] epic from the Lake Van region.  However, the Titanomachy itself could have picked up elements of western Anatolian folk memory as the tale spread westward.  Hesiod's lines have been compared with volcanic activity, citing Zeus' thunderbolts as volcanic lightning, the boiling earth and sea as a breach of the magma chamber, immense flame and heat as evidence of phreatic explosions, among many other descriptions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Luce|first=John Victor|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The end of Atlantis: New light on an old legend (New Aspects of Antiquity) |publisher=Thames & Hudson|date=1969|location=London|pages=|url=|doi=|isbn=978-0500390054}}</ref>

===Biblical traditions===
It has been proposed that one or more of [[Plagues of Egypt|ten plagues]] may be attributed to the eruption of Thera, although the presumed dates of the events of Exodus, approximately [[1450 BC|1450 BCE]] is almost 150 years after the radiometric date of the eruption.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Bennett, JG|authorlink = John G. Bennett|title = Geo-Physics and Human History: New Light on Plato's Atlantis and the Exodus|journal = Systematics|volume = 1|issue = 2|date=1963| url = http://www.matrixofcreation.co.uk/JGB/systematics-vol1-no2-127-156.htm#11| accessdate = 2007-05-22}}</ref>  According to the Bible, Egypt was beset by such misfortunes as the transforming of their water supply to blood, the infestations of frogs, gnats, and flies, darkness, and violent hail. These effects are compatible with the catastrophic eruption of a volcano in different ways. While the "blood" may have been [[red tide]] which is poisonous to human beings, the frogs could have been displaced by the eruption, and their eventual death would have given rise to large numbers of scavenging insects. The darkness could have been the resulting volcanic winter, and the hail the large chunks of ejecta spewn from the volcano. The tsunami that resulted from the Thera eruption is also speculated to have caused the parting of the sea that allowed the Israelites, under Moses, safe [[passage of the Red Sea]], possibly devastating the Egyptian army with the returning wave.  Exodus mentions that the Israelites were guided by a "pillar of smoke" during the day and a "pillar of fire" at night, which many scholars have speculated could be references to volcanic activity.  However, unambiguous dating of bristlecone pines and other dating methodologies places the Thera eruption at a date significantly different from the supposed dates of the Exodus from Egypt.<ref>{{cite book|author=Phillips, G|title=Atlantis and the Ten Plagues of Egypt: The Secret History Hidden in the Valley of the Kings|publisher=Bear & Company|date=2003|isbn=978-1591430094}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Phillips, G|url=http://www.grahamphillips.net/Books/act_new.htm#country|title=Act of God|publisher=Graham Phillips|accessdate=2007-05-22}}</ref><ref name="LaMoreaux">{{cite journal|author=LaMoreaux, PE|date=1995|title=Worldwide environmental impacts from the eruption of Thera|journal=Environmental Geology|volume=26|issue=3|pages=172-181|doi=10.1007/BF00768739}}</ref>
