The second disc contained remastered versions of the hits on the first disc, but in their original versions. It was the second time Arjona collaborated with Torres.

==Artistry==
===Music and style===
[[File:Marc Anthony 2009 White House.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Marc Anthony]] sang along Arjona on the [[Salsa music|salsa version]] of "Historia de Taxi".]]
Arjona's primary musical style is [[Latin pop]]. Mainly, he sings without the help of featured or additional singers. His style varied over the years, as Arjona showed the confidence to take risks to keep his music from becoming stale. In contrast to the ballad-laden ''[[D<U+00E9>jame Decir Que Te Amo]]'', on the latter two albums Arjona experimented with a range of pop/rock styles. ''Animal Nocturno'' intersperses energetic rock songs among heartfelt ballads, and the [[instrumentation]] is heavy on guitar, synthesizer, and drums.<ref>Birchmeier, Jason. [http://www.allmusic.com/album/animal-nocturno-r176503/review "Animal Nocturno > Review". ]. Allmusic. Retrieved on 28 March 2012.</ref> On ''Historias'', each song is stylistically distinct and the instrumentation is varied. Around two dozen instruments were used on the album, including horns, piano and [[Hammond B-3]], and strings.<ref>Birchmeier, Jason. [http://www.allmusic.com/album/historias-r203600/review "Historias > Review"]. Allmusic. Retrieved on 28 March 2012.</ref> On ''[[Si El Norte Fuera El Sur]]'', he crafted a relatively low-key effort characterized by intimate songs about love, culture, and politics. Most of the songs were written in 1995 while Arjona was touring<ref name=sielnorte>Birchmeier, Jason.

Retrieved on 28 March 2012.</ref> and are performed acoustically with [[Caribbean music|Caribbean]] touches. Besides a couple of rockers, the songs are fairly even in tone and tempo.<ref name=sielnorte/> 

In ''[[Galer<U+00ED>a Caribe]]'', Arjona explored [[Afro-Caribbean music|Afro-Caribbean]] sounds, employing traditional rhythms such as [[guaracha]], [[Bachata (music)|bachata]], [[Merengue music|merengue]], and [[Salsa music|salsa]].<ref>Birchmeier, Jason.

On 2007's ''[[Qui<U+00E9>n Dijo Ayer]]'', Arjona reworked past songs to fit a new style. For example, he gave "Si El Norte Fuera El Sur" a [[ska]] beat, and performed with the aid of [[Pante<U+00F3>n Rococ<U+00F3>]].<ref name=qdaallmusic>Birchmeier, Jason.

Estereofonica. Ret. on 28 March 2012.</ref>

''[[Poquita Ropa]]'' offered a drastic change in which Arjona minimized the number of instruments. The result was a set of [[a capella]] performances. Arjona commented about this album that "music and women look better with little clothes."<ref name=unionradio1/> Production was handled by Arjona and Dan Warner, who also worked with [[Shakira]], [[Celine Dion]] and [[Christina Aguilera]].<ref name=puente1>[http://www.nacion.com/2010-08-09/Entretenimiento/NotaPrincipal/v09-GERAR-MUSICA1.aspx "Ricardo Arjona tiende hoy su Puente"].

"Puente", the lead single, is the only notable exception. It lasts eight and a half minutes and is divided in three parts. The first is sung mainly with a piano. The second part is a ballad with [[Caribbean music|Caribbean]] and [[Latin music|Latin sounds]], with some [[Salsa music|salsa]] and [[Cuban music|Cuban influences]].<ref>[http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldetoluca/notas/n1739751.htm "Le canta al pueblo cubano"].

In ''[[Independiente (Ricardo Arjona album)|Independiente]]'', Arjona returned to his trademark sound, which Torres helped craft. David Feffries of Allmusic gave the album a somewhat positive review. He compared the production values and musical style of ''Independiente'' with those of past albums ''Animal Nocturno'' and ''Historias'', stating, "Returning fans will revel in this combination of freedom and growth, and appreciate the return of producer Tommy Torres, the man who has been behind the boards for quite a few of Arjona's most popular releases", referring precisely to the absence of Torres in the production of ''Poquita Ropa''.<ref name="feffries">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r2283669|pure_url=yes}}|title= Independiente > Review| first=David|last=Jeffries |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=6 November 2011}}</ref>

===Collaborators===
Only longtime collaborators Dan Warner and Tommy Torres provided notable [[background vocals]] where needed. Five Arjona albums, including one compilation album, feature additional artists. ''Galer<U+00ED>a Caribe'' features vocals from artist [[Ednita Nazario]] on "Porque Hablamos". ''Adentro'' features vocals from Spanish artist [[Chenoa]] on "Ping<U+00FC>inos En La Cama" and as well as American [[Tejano music|Tejano]] band [[Intocable]] on "Mojado". The third album, ''Qui<U+00E9>n Dijo Ayer'', features additional vocals from [[Marta S<U+00E1>nchez]] on "Tarde (Sin Da<U+00F1>os a Terceros)"; [[Pante<U+00F3>n Rococ<U+00F3>]] on "Si El Norte Fuera El Sur"; Marc Anthony on "Historia de Taxi"; [[Sandro de Am<U+00E9>rica|Sandro]] on "Realmente No Estoy Tan Solo"; and [[Eros Ramazzotti]] on "A Ti". The fourth is ''5to Piso'', on which [[Paquita la del Barrio]] collaborates on the track "Ni T<U+00FA> Ni Yo". The fifth album is ''Independiente'', in which Moreno starred alongside Arjona on "[[Fuiste T<U+00FA>]]".
