'''<U+00C9>va Gauthier''' ([[September 20]], [[1885]] &ndash; [[December 20]], [[1958]]) was a Canadian [[mezzo-soprano]] and voice teacher.  She performed and popularised modern songs throughout her career.<ref>{{cite web|title = <U+00C9>va Gauthier, mezzo-soprano and voice teacher (1885-1958)|work = Collections Canada |url = http://www.collectionscanada.ca/gramophone/m2-1009-e.html |date=[[June 18]] [[2005]] |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>  She was the niece of Lady [[Zo<U+00EB> Laurier]] and Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]], who also were her [[patron]]s.  She was praised for the many qualities her singing brought to music. The citation from the [[Campion Society of San Francisco]], which she received in 1949, said: "...her rare open-mindedness and unorthodox enthusiasm having been initially responsible for the recognition of many vital and important modern composers"<ref name = "LATER" />

==Singing career==
Born in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Gauthier received musical lessons as a child, in [[harmony]], [[voice]], and [[piano]].<ref name = "EARLY">{{cite web|url = http://www.collectionscanada.ca/gramophone/m2-1009.1-e.html|title = <U+00C9>va Gauthier - Early Career|work = Collections Canada |date=[[June 18]] [[2005]] |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>  The custom of the time dictated that North American musicians travel to Europe for training if they desired a reputable professional career, and in July 1902, at the age of seventeen, Gauthier set out for Europe, financed by her aunt and uncle, Lady Zo<U+0451> Laurier and Sir Wilfrid Laurier.<ref name = "CANENC">{{cite web|url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0001330|title = Gauthier, Eva|work = The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>  

===Training in Europe===
Gauthier travelled to France, where she received private voice lessons from Auguste-Jean Dubulle of the [[Paris Conservatory]].  Nodules on her [[vocal chord]]s  were problematic, but they were removed surgically. She later began training under [[Jacques Bouhy]], whom she would later credit for her vocal technique.<ref name = "EARLY" />

In 1906, Gauthier was retained by fellow Canadian singer [[Emma Albani]] to accompany her on a tour of [[England]] and her Canadian farewell tour.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.biographi.ca/EN/ShowBio.asp?BioId=42063|title = Lajeunesse, Emma|work = Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online |date=2004 |accsesdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>  Albani provided a degree of mentorship to Gauthier during the 30 week tour of Canada.<ref name = "EARLY" />

[[Lord Strathcona]] awarded Gauthier a scholarship in 1906 that allowed her to return to Europe and continue her vocal studies.  She returned there and continued both to study and to give performances.  Her first [[opera]]tic performance came in 1909 in [[Pavia]], [[Italy]] as Mica<U+00EB>la in [[Carmen (opera)|Carmen]].  She landed a second operatic role as Mallika in [[L<U+00E9>o Delibes]]' [[Lakm<U+00E9>]], which was being performed by the [[Royal Opera House|London Covent Garden opera company]].  The opera opened in June 1910.  Supposedly, [[Luisa Tetrazzini]], the [[Prima Donna]] [[Soprano]] of the company feared that Gauthier's voice would outshine her own, and demanded that Gauthier be removed from the opera.  The company's director acquiesced to the Prima Donna's demands, informing Gauthier on opening night that she would not be performing.  Gauthier reacted badly, and quit opera entirely.<ref name = "EARLY" />

===Move to Java===
[[Image:EvaGauthierCostume.jpg|right|thumb|<U+00C9>va Gauthier in Javanese Costume]]

Disappointed by her blocked entry into the operatic scene, Gauthier departed Europe and travelled to [[Java]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.collectionscanada.ca/gramophone/m2-1009.2-e.html|title = <U+00C9>va Gauthier - Concert Tours|work = Collections Canada |date=[[July 18]] [[2005]] |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>  There, she met [[The Netherlands|Dutch]] importer and plantation manager Frans Knoote.  Gauthier and Knoote married on [[May 22]] [[1911]].  Gauthier studied the music of Java, and began to include this in her repertoire.  Her accompanying pianist was Paul Seelig, who had previously been the conductor for the [[Kraton (Indonesia)|Kraton]] of [[Surakarta]], which afforded Gauthier a number of opportunities.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Dancing The Subject of 'Java': International Modernism and Traditional Performance, 1899<U+2013>1952|author=Cohen, M. Isaac |journal = Indonesia and the Malay World|date = [[01 March]], [[2007]]|publisher = Taylor & Francis |format=PDF |url =  http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/index/54M0L1323MH2422L.pdf}}</ref>  On permission of the Javanese court, she studied the [[gamelan]], probably being the first western woman with a classical music education to be afforded this opportunity.  While living in Java, Gauthier travelled extensively, giving performances in [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaya]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]].  She remained in Java for four years, but with the outbreak of [[World War I]] she decided to travel back to North America, arriving in [[New York City]] in the [[autumn|fall]] of 1915.

===Return to North America===
Arriving in New York, Gauthier struggled to find a niche in an already crowded music scene.  She put on a performance in [[Vaudville]] entitlted ''Songmotion'', which combined Javan music with dancers.<ref name = "SUCCESS">{{cite web|url = http://www.collectionscanada.ca/gramophone/m2-1009.3-e.html|title = <U+00C9>va Gauthier - New York and Celebrity|work = Collections Canada |date=[[July 18]] [[2007]] |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>  New York was already home to many North American and European musical performers, so Gauthier focused on her Javan musical repertoire, which she combined with knowledge and skill in modernist western singing.  Gauthier began giving annual recitals at [[Aeolian Hall]], and in November 1917 her performance there caught the eye of many leading composers.  She developed her own reputation quickly, known as a "...sensitive purveyor of interesting, untried songs".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,743654,00.html?promoid=googlep|title = Specialist|date = [[April 25]], [[1932]]|work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>  She gave renditions of three songs by [[Maurice Ravel]].  Her performance then also included American premieres of [[Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Three Japanese Lyrics]]'' and [[Charles Tomlinson Griffes]]' ''[[Five Poems of Ancient China and Japan]]''.  The performance was a smashing success, and she began to receive invitations to perform premieres of songs by contemporary composers.  Stravinsky arranged to have Gauthier to premiere all of his vocal pieces.

Gauthier travelled to Paris in 1920 at the behest of the [[Music League of America]].  Sent there to arrange a tour of North America by [[Ravel]], she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him, but also with [[Erik Satie]] and [[Les Six]].<ref name = "SUCCESS" />  This led to more music being sent to her by various composers that she would premiere in concert.  She accepted and premiered almost all works sent to her, the only exception was a refusal to perform ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]'' by [[Arnold Schoenberg]].  Through this, Gauthier performed large amounts of contemporary French music across the United States.  She also included American music in all of her concerts.  Gauthier toured America frequently and returned to Europe in 1922, and again in 1923.<ref name = "SUCCESS" />  She began to explore [[Jazz]] music in concert as well, earning her negative reviews by many musical critics.

Her 1923 annual performance at [[Aeolian Hall]] entitled ''Recital of Ancient and Modern Music for Voice'' became a historic occasion when she presented the works of [[George Gershwin]], the first time his works were performed by a classical singer in concert.  The first half of the programme presented works considered serious music at the time.  She performed both classical works by [[Vincenzo Bellini]] and [[Henry Purcell]], mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Darius Milhaud]], [[B<U+00E9>la Bart<U+00F3>k]], and [[Paul Hindemith]].<ref name = "SUCCESS" />  The second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment, however.  She opened with ''[[Alexander's Ragtime Band]]'' by [[Irving Berlin]], then performed works by [[Jerome Kern]] and [[Walter Donaldson]], and finally finished with three works by [[George Gershwin]]: ''I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise'', ''Innocent Ing<U+00E9>nue Baby'', and ''Swanee''.  Gershwin played the piano for these pieces.  Important figures in the audience included [[Ernestine Schumann-Heink]], [[Virgil Thomson]], and [[Paul Whiteman]].  Although some musical critics panned her decision to include Jazz music,<ref>{{cite journal|title = Musical Notes from Abroad|journal = The Musical Times|volume = 64|number = 970|date = December 1923|pages =872-875|url = http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0027-4666%2819231201%2964%3A970%3C872%3AMNFA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-T |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref> the performance was overall a huge success,<ref>{{cite journal|title = The Seven Jazz Preludes of George Gershwin: A Historical Narrative|author = Robert Wyatt|journal = American Music, Special Jazz Issue |volume = 7|number = 1|date = Spring, 1989|pages = 68-85|url = http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0734-4392%28198921%297%3A1%3C68%3ATSJPOG%3E2.0.CO%3B2-T |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref> and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E4DF1039F93BA25757C0A964948260|title = Capturing Gershwin's Genius|author =Rockwell, John |date = [[April 18]] [[1982]]|work = New York Times |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>  

Gauthier continued to present music that was thought poorly of by conservative audiences.  On some occasions, such as her performances of Gershwin in New York in 1923 and 1925, as well as in London in 1925, this was quite successful.  A critic in Vienna welcomed her musical selection as a reprieve from the usual choices of classical performances: [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Brahms]], [[Hugo Wolf|Wolf]], [[Strauss]], while praising her skill with more classical choices.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Musical Notes from Abroad|journal = The Musical Times|volume = 66|number = 994|date = December 1925|pages = 1133-1136|url = http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0027-4666%2819251201%2966%3A994%3C1133%3AMNFA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-B |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>  Other performances suffered - she was [[boo]]ed while performing works of [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]] at the Festival of the [[International Society of Contemporary Music]] in [[Venice]].<ref name = "SUCCESS" />  She became a [[celebrity]], and continued giving performances across the United States, Europe, and her native Canada.  On the sixtieth anniversary of [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1927, she gave a performance in Ottawa which was the first transcontinental radio broadcast in Canada.  Although she both toured Canada from time to time, and attended performances of Canadian music in New York, she held a negative opinion of Canada's treatment of native musicians, saying "Canadians . . . would rather listen to foreigners than their own people."<ref>Gauthier, <U+00C9>va (October 15, 1937). ''Globe and Mail''.</ref>

===Retirement from the stage===

Illness led to Gauthier being forced to halt giving performances in the late 1920s, but she would return to the stage in 1931, giving a concert in [[Havana]].<ref name = "LATER">{{cite web|url = http://www.collectionscanada.ca/gramophone/m2-1009.4-e.html|title = <U+00C9>va Gauthier - Later Career|work = Collections Canada |[[July 18]] [[2005]] |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref> As time passed she began to engage more and more in teaching, and less and less in stage performing. Her income from teaching was substantially better than from touring.  She retired from performing entirely in 1937, and opened a music studio in New York. There she became a founding member of the [[American Guild of Musical Artists]], serving on its board of governors.

==Views of critics and audiences==
[[Image:EvaGauthier1905.jpg|right|thumb|<U+00C9>va Gauthier, 1905]]
Gauthier was a controversial musician in her time.  Her choice of music for performance was often condemned, and often praised.  The appropriateness of jazz music for a classically trained singer, combined with the performances taking place is concert halls lead some critics to cheer her for promoting otherwise overlooked music, and others to condemn  her for taking [[lowbrow]] music into a highbrow venue.

A [[May 1]] [[1917]] review by the ''[[New York Times]]'' praised her natural talent, with some reservations about the unpolished quality of her voice. Her ability to capture the spirit of the pieces was also praised: "...her singing of songs by Frenchmen of today and the day before yesterday gave pleasure because of her understanding of them and the appropriate expression which she found for them."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historicopera.com/jsingerg_G1_page.htm |title=Singers G-1 |work=Historic Opera |date=[[June 4]] [[2004]] |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref> 

A [[November 12]], [[1923]] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' review of her performance of historic Italian songs, as well as modern English, French, Austrian, German and American numbers focused on her choice to include selections of contemporary jazz music. The critic remarked "Her voice was much too good for jazz."<ref>{{cite news|url = http://aolsvc.timeforkids.kol.aol.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,716939,00.html|title = Concert Jazz|work = Time|date = [[November 12]], [[1923]] |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>  Here she was praised as a serious, scholarly artist whose performance was "...neat and expressive."  The audience received the concert very enthusiastically.

Her performance in [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]] in 1923 resulted in a headline in the [[Fargo Forum]] the next day that read ''Eva Gauthier<U+2019>s Program Sets Whole Town Buzzing: Many People Are of Two Minds Regarding Jazz Numbers <U+2013> Some Reluctantly Admit That They Like Them <U+2013> Others Keep Silent or Condemn Them''.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.prairiepublic.org/programs/datebook/bydate/04/0104/012104.jsp|title = Dakota Datebook - "Jazz Comes to North Dakota"|work = North Dakota Public Radio |date=[[January 21]] [[2004]] |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>  The review divides the audience and critics among those who openly enjoyed and applauded the performance and those who openly disliked and condemned it, but also into those unsure how to react to a performance they liked but felt was inappropriate, or who liked the performance but would not show approval for fear of looking foolish or uncultured.
