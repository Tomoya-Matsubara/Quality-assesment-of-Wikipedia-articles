}}
'''Michael Jeffrey Jordan''' (born February 17, 1963) is a former American [[professional basketball]] player, active businessman, and majority owner of the [[Charlotte Bobcats]]. His biography on the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) website states, "By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time."<ref name="nbah"/>  Jordan was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and was instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s.

After a standout career at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he led the Tar Heels to a [[1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|National Championship]] in 1982, Jordan joined the NBA's [[Chicago Bulls]] in [[1984 NBA Draft|1984]]. He quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring. His leaping ability, illustrated by performing [[slam dunk]]s from the [[free throw line]] in [[slam dunk contest]]s, earned him the nicknames "'''Air Jordan'''" and "'''His Airness'''". He also gained a reputation for being one of the best defensive players in basketball.<ref name="defensive players"/> In [[1991 NBA Finals|1991]], he won his first NBA championship with the Bulls, and followed that achievement with titles in [[1992 NBA Finals|1992]] and [[1993 NBA Finals|1993]], securing a "[[three-peat]]". Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball at the beginning of the [[1993<U+2013>94 NBA season]] to pursue a career in [[baseball]], he rejoined the Bulls in [[1995-96 NBA season|1995]] and led them to three additional championships ([[1996 NBA Finals|1996]], [[1997 NBA Finals|1997]], and [[1998 NBA Finals|1998]]) as well as an NBA-record [[List of NBA teams by single season win percentage|72 regular-season wins]] in the 1995<U+2013>96 NBA season. Jordan retired for a second time in [[1998-99 NBA season|1999]], but returned for two more NBA seasons in [[2001-02 NBA season|2001]] as a member of the [[Washington Wizards]].

Jordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include five [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] awards, ten [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA]] First Team designations, nine [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive]] First Team honors, fourteen [[NBA All-Star Game]] appearances, three All-Star Game [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] awards, ten [[List_of_National_Basketball_Association_season_scoring_leaders|scoring titles]], three [[steal (basketball)|steals]] titles, six [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals MVP awards]], and the 1988 [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]]. He holds the NBA records for highest career regular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and highest career playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century by [[ESPN]], and was second to [[Babe Ruth]] on the [[Associated Press]]'s list of athletes of the century. He was elected to the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] on April 6, 2009 and was inducted on September 11, 2009.<ref name="was inducted"/>

Jordan is also noted for his product endorsements. He fueled the success of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike's]] [[Air Jordan]] sneakers, which were introduced in 1985 and remain popular today.<ref name="remain popular"/> Jordan also starred in the [[American films of 1996|1996]] feature film ''[[Space Jam]]'' as himself. He is the majority owner and head of basketball operations for the NBA's [[Charlotte Bobcats]]; he recently won a bidding war to buy controlling interest in the team from founding owner [[Robert L. Johnson]].

== Early years ==
[[File:Michael Jordan UNC Jersey cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Michael Jordan's jersey in the rafters of The [[Dean Smith Center]]]]
Jordan was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]], the son of Deloris ([[married and maiden names|n<U+00E9>e]] Peoples), who worked in banking, and [[James R. Jordan, Sr.]], an equipment supervisor.<ref name="equipment supervisor"/> His family moved to [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], when he was a toddler.<ref name="a toddler"/> Jordan attended [[Emsley A. Laney High School]] in Wilmington, where he anchored his athletic career by playing [[baseball]], [[American football|football]], and [[basketball]]. He tried out for the [[varsity team|varsity]] basketball team during his [[Tenth grade|sophomore]] year, but at 5'11" (1.80&nbsp;m), he was deemed too short to play at that level. His taller friend, [[Harvest Smith|Harvest Leroy Smith]], was the only sophomore to make the team.<ref name="halb"/>

Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's [[junior varsity]] squad, and tallied several 40 point games.<ref name=halb/> The following summer, he grew four inches (10&nbsp;cm)<ref name="nbah"/> and trained rigorously. Upon earning a spot on the varsity [[roster]], Jordan averaged about 20 points per game over his final two seasons of high school play.<ref name="br"/><ref name="BB"/> As a [[Twelfth grade|senior]], he was selected to the [[McDonald's All-American Team]]<ref name="McDonald's"/> after averaging a [[triple-double]]: 29.2 points, 11.6 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]], and 10.1 [[assist (basketball)|assists]].<ref name="triple-double"/>

In 1981, Jordan earned a basketball scholarship to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he [[College major|majored]] in [[cultural geography]]. As a freshman in coach [[Dean Smith]]'s team-oriented system, he was named [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] Freshman of the Year after he averaged 13.4 [[points per game]] (ppg) on 53.4% shooting ([[field goal percentage]]).<ref name="dbb"/> He made the game-winning jump shot in the [[1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament#Championship game|1982 NCAA Championship]] game against [[Georgetown Hoyas|Georgetown]], which was led by future NBA rival [[Patrick Ewing]].<ref name="nbah"/> Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career.<ref>qtd. in Lazenby, Roland. "Michaelangelo: Portrait of a Champion". ''Michael Jordan: The Ultimate Career Tribute''. Bannockburn, IL: H&S Media, 1999. pg. 128.</ref> During his three seasons at North Carolina, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting, and added 5.0 [[rebounds per game]] (rpg).<ref name="br" />  He was selected by consensus to the [[1983 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|NCAA All-American First Team]] in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons.  After winning the [[Naismith College Player of the Year|Naismith]] and the [[John R. Wooden Award|Wooden]] College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the [[1984 NBA Draft]]. The [[Chicago Bulls]] selected Jordan with the third overall pick, after [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] ([[Houston Rockets]]) and [[Sam Bowie]] ([[Portland Trail Blazers]]). Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986.<ref>Morris, Mike. "The Legend: A Highlight-Reel History of the NBA's Greatest Player". ''Michael Jordan: The Ultimate Career Tribute''. Bannockburn, IL: H&S Media, 1999. pg. 67.</ref>

== Professional career ==
During [[1984-85 NBA season|his first season]] in the NBA, Jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5% shooting.<ref name="dbb"/> He quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas,<ref name="Gross">Gross, Jane.

Jordan's [[1985-86 NBA season|second season]] was cut short by a broken foot which caused him to miss 64 games.<ref name="nbah"/> Despite Jordan's injury and a 30<U+2013>52 record,<ref name="dbbulls"/> the Bulls made the [[1986 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]]. Jordan recovered in time to participate in the playoffs and performed well upon his return. Against a 1985<U+2013>86 [[Boston Celtics]] team that is often considered one of the greatest in NBA history,<ref name="topteams">[http://www.nba.com/history/toptenteams_index.html Top 10 Teams in NBA History], nba.com/history, accessed March 6, 2007.</ref> Jordan set the still-unbroken record for points in a playoff game with 63 in Game 2.<ref name="nbagod">[http://www.nba.com/history/jordan63_moments.html God Disguised as Michael Jordan], nba.com/history, accessed January 17, 2007.</ref> The Celtics, however, managed to [[sweep#Sports|sweep]] the series.<ref name="nba.combio"/>

Jordan had recovered completely by the [[1986-87 NBA season|1986<U+2013>87 season]], and had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history. He became the only player other than [[Wilt Chamberlain]] to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league high 37.1 points on 48.2% shooting.<ref name="dbb"/> In addition, Jordan demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 [[block (basketball)|blocks]] in a season. Despite Jordan's success, [[Magic Johnson]] won the league's [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]]. The Bulls reached 40 wins,<ref name="dbbulls"/> and advanced to [[1987 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] for the third consecutive year. However, they were again swept by the Celtics.<ref name="nba.combio"/>

=== Mid-career: Pistons roadblock ===
Jordan led the league in scoring again in the [[1987-88 NBA season|1987<U+2013>88 season]], averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting<ref name="dbb"/> and won his first league [[NBA Most Valuable Player award|MVP award]]. He was also named the [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year|Defensive Player of the Year]], as he had averaged 1.6 blocks and a league high 3.16 steals per game.<ref name="MJ">[http://www.nba.com/history/players/jordan_stats.html Michael Jordan statistics], nba.com/history, accessed January 16, 2007.</ref> The Bulls finished 50<U+2013>32,<ref name="dbbulls"/> and made it out of the first round of [[1988 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] for the first time in Jordan's career, as they defeated the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] in five games.<ref>[http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teamscores.htm?tm=CHI&yr=1987&lg=n Chicago Bulls 1987<U+2013>88 Game Log and Scores], databasebasketball.com, accessed January 16, 2007.</ref> However, the Bulls then lost in five games to the more experienced [[Detroit Pistons]],<ref name="nba.combio"/> who were led by [[Isiah Thomas]] and a group of physical players known as the "[[Detroit Pistons#1980s: The Bad Boys era|Bad Boys]]".

In the [[1988-89 NBA season|1988<U+2013>89 season]], Jordan again led the league in scoring, averaging 32.5 ppg on 53.8% shooting from the field, along with 8 rpg and 8 [[assists per game]] (apg).<ref name="dbb"/> The Bulls finished with a 47<U+2013>35 record,<ref name="dbbulls"/> and advanced to the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] Finals, defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers and [[New York Knicks]] along the way. The Cavaliers series included a career highlight for Jordan when he hit a [[The Shot|series-winning shot]] over [[Craig Ehlo]] in the closing moments of the deciding fifth game of the series.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/history/jordancav_moments.html Jordan Hits "The Shot"], nba.com/history, accessed May 24, 2010.</ref> However, the Pistons again defeated the Bulls, this time in six games,<ref name="nba.combio"/> by utilizing their "[[Jordan Rules]]" method of guarding Jordan, which consisted of [[double team|double and triple teaming]] him every time he touched the ball.<ref name="nbah"/>

The Bulls entered the [[1989-90 NBA season|1989<U+2013>90 season]] as a team on the rise, with their core group of Jordan and young improving players like [[Scottie Pippen]] and [[Horace Grant]], and under the guidance of new coach [[Phil Jackson]]. Jordan averaged a league leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting, to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg<ref name="dbb"/> in leading the Bulls to a 55<U+2013>27 record.<ref name="dbbulls"/> They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals beating the Bucks and [[Philadelphia 76ers]] en route. However, despite pushing the series to seven games, the Bulls lost to the Pistons for the third consecutive season.<ref name="nba.combio"/>

=== First three-peat ===
In the [[1990<U+2013>91 NBA season|1990<U+2013>91 season]], Jordan won his second MVP award after averaging 31.5 ppg on 53.9% shooting, 6.0 rpg, and 5.5 apg for the regular season.<ref name="dbb"/> The Bulls finished in first place in their division for the first time in 16 years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season.<ref name="dbbulls"/> With [[Scottie Pippen]] developing into an All-Star, the Bulls elevated their play. The Bulls defeated the [[New York Knicks]] and the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the opening two rounds of [[1991 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]]. They advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals where their rival, the Detroit Pistons, awaited them. However, this time the Bulls beat the Pistons in a surprising sweep.<ref name="1990-91">[http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teamscores.htm?tm=CHI&yr=1990&lg=n Chicago Bulls 1990<U+2013>91 Game Log and Scores], databasebasketball.com, accessed March 7, 2007.</ref><ref>Brown, Clifton.

The Bulls compiled an outstanding 15<U+2013>2 record during the playoffs,<ref name="1990-91"/> and advanced to [[1991 NBA Finals|the NBA Finals]] for the first time in franchise history, where they beat the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] four games to one. Perhaps the best known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential [[Sam Perkins]] block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot in.<ref>[[Michael Wilbon|Wilbon, Michael]].

Jordan and the Bulls continued their dominance in the [[1991-92 NBA season|1991<U+2013>92 season]], establishing a 67<U+2013>15 record, topping their franchise record from 1990<U+2013>91.<ref name="dbbulls"/> Jordan won his second consecutive MVP award with averages of 30.1 points, 6.4 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game on 52% shooting.<ref name="MJ"/> After winning a physical 7-game series over the New York Knicks in the second round of [[1992 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] and finishing off the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Conference Finals in 6 games, the Bulls met [[Clyde Drexler]] and the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in [[1992 NBA Finals|the Finals]]. The media, hoping to recreate a [[Celtics<U+2013>Lakers rivalry|Magic-Bird rivalry]], highlighted the similarities between "Air" Jordan and Clyde "The Glide" during the pre-Finals hype.<ref name="sport-illustrated-cover">[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/cover/featured/9328/index.htm Sport's Illustrated cover, May 11, 1992]. sportsillustrated.cnn.com, accessed February 16, 2009</ref> In the first game, Jordan scored a Finals-record 35 points in the first half, including a record-setting six [[three-point field goal]]s.<ref name="NBA1991-92">[http://www.nba.com/history/jordan_92_finals.html Jordan Blazes Away From Long Range], nba.com, accessed March 9, 2007.</ref> After the sixth three-pointer, he jogged down the court shrugging as he looked courtside. [[Marv Albert]], who broadcast the game, later stated that it was as if Jordan was saying, "I can't believe I'm doing this."<ref>[http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/finals/Memory_Lane.html A Stroll Down Memory Lane], nba.com/history, accessed February 23, 2007.</ref> The Bulls went on to win Game 1, and defeat the Blazers in six games. Jordan was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row<ref name="fnl"/> and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, and 6.5 apg, while shooting 53% from the floor.<ref name="fnl"/>

In [[1992-93 NBA season|1992<U+2013>93]], despite a 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg and 5.5 apg campaign,<ref name="MJ"/> Jordan's streak of consecutive MVP seasons ended as he lost the award to his friend [[Charles Barkley]]. Coincidentally, Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his [[Phoenix Suns]] in the [[1993 NBA Finals]]. The Bulls captured their third consecutive NBA championship on a game-winning shot by [[John Paxson]] and a last-second block by [[Horace Grant]], but Jordan was once again Chicago's catalyst. He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series,<ref>[http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19921993.html Paxson's Trey Propels Bulls Into NBA History], nba.com/history, accessed January 20, 2007.</ref> and became the first player in NBA history to win three straight Finals MVP awards.<ref name="fnl"/> He scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points in 4 consecutive games. With his third Finals triumph, Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there were signs that Jordan was tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life.<ref>McCallum, Jack.

=== Gambling controversy ===

=== First retirement and baseball career ===
[[File:Jordan Scorpians.jpg|thumb|200px| Michael Jordan while playing with the Scottsdale Scorpions]]

=== "I'm back": Return to the NBA ===

But the [[1994-95 NBA season|1994<U+2013>95]] version of the Bulls was a shell of the championship squad of just two years earlier.

On March 18, 1995, Jordan announced his return to the NBA through a pithy press release: "I'm back."<ref name="nbah"/> The next day, Jordan donned jersey number 45 (his number with the Barons), as his familiar 23 had been retired in his honor following his first retirement. He took to the court with the Bulls to face the [[Indiana Pacers]] in [[Indianapolis]], scoring 19 points.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n21_v87/ai_16820794 "Michael Jordan returns to Bulls in overtime loss to Indiana Pacers <U+2013> Chicago Bulls"], ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet Magazine]]'', April 3, 1995, available at findarticles.com, accessed May 2, 2008.</ref> The game had the highest [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of a regular season NBA game since 1975.<ref>Hausman, Jerry A. and Gregory K.

Although he had not played in an NBA game in a year and a half, Jordan played well upon his return, making a game-winning jump shot against [[Atlanta Hawks|Atlanta]] in his fourth game back and scoring 55 points in a game against the Knicks at [[Madison Square Garden]] on March 28, 1995.<ref name="nba.combio"/> Boosted by Jordan's comeback, the Bulls [[1995 NBA Playoffs|made the playoffs]] and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semi-finals against the [[Orlando Magic]].

In the [[1996-97 NBA season|1996<U+2013>97 season]], the Bulls started out 69<U+2013>11, but narrowly missed out on a second consecutive 70-win season by losing their final two games to finish 69<U+2013>13.<ref name="1996-97">[http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teamscores.htm?tm=CHI&yr=1996&lg=n Chicago Bulls 1996<U+2013>97 Game Log and Scores], databasebasketball.com, accessed January 16, 2007.</ref> However, this year Jordan was beaten for the NBA MVP Award by [[Karl Malone]].

The Bulls returned to Utah for [[Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals|Game 6]] on June 14, 1998 leading the series 3<U+2013>2.

Jordan's final NBA game was on April 16, 2003 in [[Philadelphia]]. After scoring only 13 points in the game, Jordan went to the bench with 4 minutes and 13 seconds remaining in the third quarter and with his team trailing the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], 75<U+2013>56. Just after the start of the fourth quarter, the [[First Union Center]] crowd began chanting "We want Mike!". After much encouragement from coach [[Doug Collins]], Jordan finally rose from the bench and re-entered the game for [[Larry Hughes]] with 2:35 remaining. At 1:45, Jordan was intentionally fouled by the 76ers' [[Eric Snow]], and stepped to the line to make both free throws. After the second foul shot, the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie [[John Salmons]], who in turn was intentionally fouled by [[Bobby Simmons]] one second later, stopping time so that Jordan could return to the bench. Jordan received a three-minute standing ovation from his teammates, his opponents, the officials and a crowd of 21,257 fans.<ref name="fg">[http://www.nba.com/games/20030416/WASPHI/recap.html Sixers Prevail in Jordan's Final Game], nba.com, April 16, 2003, accessed January 16, 2007.</ref>

Jordan played on two [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[gold medal]]-winning American basketball teams. As a college player he participated, and won the gold, in the [[1984 Summer Olympics]].

== Player profile ==
<!----THIS SECTION IS FOR DESCRIBING HIS PLAYING STYLE AND STRENGTHS AS A PLAYER. ACCOLADES AND OTHER AWARDS GO IN LEGACY OR UNDER CAREER ACHIEVEMENTS.-->
Jordan was a [[shooting guard]] who was also capable of playing [[small forward]] (the position he would primarily play during his second comeback with the [[Washington Wizards]]). Jordan was known throughout his career for being a strong clutch performer. He decided numerous games with last-second plays (e.g., [[The Shot]]) and performed at a high level even under adverse circumstances (e.g., [[Flu game#Game 5: The Flu Game|Flu Game]]). His competitiveness was visible in his prolific [[trash-talk]]<ref>DeCourcy, Mike. [http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=110400 "A suspension for talking trash? Mamma mia!"], sportingnews.com, July 21, 2006, accessed January 16, 2007.</ref> and well-known work ethic.<ref>Jackson, Phil.

Jordan had a versatile offensive game. He was capable of aggressively [[Penetration (basketball)|driving]] to the basket and drawing [[Personal foul (basketball)|fouls]] from his opponents at a high rate; his 8,772 [[free throw]] attempts are the ninth highest total of all time.<ref>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fta_career.html Career Leaders for Free Throw Attempts], basketball-reference.com, accessed May 16, 2008.</ref> As his career progressed, Jordan also developed the ability to [[post up]] his opponents and score with his trademark [[fadeaway]] [[jump shot (basketball)|jumpshot]], using his leaping ability to "fade away" from block attempts. According to [[Hubie Brown]], this move alone made him nearly unstoppable.<ref>[[Hubie Brown|Brown, Hubie]]. [http://www.nba.com/jordan/hubieonjordan.html Hubie Brown on Jordan], nba.com, accessed January 15, 2007.</ref> Despite media criticism as a "selfish" player early in his career, Jordan's 5.3 assists per game<ref name="dbb"/> also indicate his willingness to defer to his teammates. In later years, the NBA shortened its [[Three-point field goal|three-point]] line to 22 feet (from 23 feet, 9&nbsp;inches), which coupled with Jordan's extended shooting range to make him a long-range threat as well<U+2014>his 3-point stroke developed from a low 9 / 52 rate (.173) in his rookie year into a stellar 111 / 260 (.427) shooter in the 1995<U+2013>96 season.<ref name="dbb"/> For a guard, Jordan was also a good rebounder (6.2 per game).<ref name="dbb"/>

In 1988, Jordan was honored with the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year Award and became the first NBA player to win both the Defensive Player of the Year and MVP awards in a career (since equaled by [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]], and [[Kevin Garnett]]; Olajuwon is the only player other than Jordan to win both during the same season). In addition he set records for [[block (basketball)|blocked shots]] by a guard,<ref>Ladewski, Paul. [http://www.nba.com/jordan/hoop_86-87.html What Does He Do for an Encore?], ''Hoop Magazine'', December 1987, available at nba.com, accessed January 16, 2007.</ref> and combined this with his ball-thieving ability to become a standout defensive player. His 2,514 [[steal (basketball)|steals]] are the second highest total of all-time behind [[John Stockton]], while his steals per game average is third all-time.<ref>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/stl_career.html Career Leaders for Steals], basketball-reference.com, accessed May 23, 2008.</ref> [[Jerry West]] often stated that he was more impressed with Jordan's defensive contributions than his offensive ones.<ref name="cnnsi">[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/1999/jordan_retires/news/1999/01/13/jordan_greatest/ Michael Jordan: A tribute: Praise from his peers, NBA's 50 greatest sing MJ's praises], sportsillustrated.cnn.com, February 1, 1999, accessed January 15, 2007.</ref>

== Legacy ==
Jordan's basketball talent was clear from his rookie season.<ref name="Gross"/><ref name="Garden"/> In his first game in [[Madison Square Garden]] against the New York Knicks, Jordan received a prolonged standing ovation,<ref name="Garden"/> a rarity for an opposing player. After Jordan scored a playoff record 63 points against the [[Boston Celtics]] in 1986, Celtics star [[Larry Bird]] described him as "God disguised as Michael Jordan."<ref name="nbagod"/>
{{pquote|By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.|Introductory line of Jordan's NBA Encyclopedia biography|<ref name="nbah"/>}}

Jordan led the NBA in scoring in 10 seasons (NBA record) and tied [[Wilt Chamberlain]]'s record of seven consecutive scoring titles. He was also a fixture on the NBA All-Defensive First Team, making the roster nine times (NBA record shared with [[Gary Payton]]). Jordan also holds the top career regular season and playoff scoring averages of 30.1 and 33.4 points per game,<ref name="nbah"/> respectively. By 1998, the season of his Finals-winning shot against the Jazz, he was well known throughout the league as a [[clutch (sports)|clutch performer]]. In the regular season, Jordan was the Bulls' primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs, Jordan would always demand the ball at crunch time.<ref>Sachare, Alex. [http://www.nba.com/jordan/hoop_gotoguys.html Go-Two Guys], ''Hoop Magazine'', June 1996, accessed February 12, 2009.</ref> Jordan's total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the highest in NBA history.<ref name="playoff history">[http://www.nba.com/history/records/alltime_playoffs_ind_career.html All-Time Playoffs Individual Career Leaders], nba.com, accessed March 5, 2007.</ref> He retired with 32,292 points in regular season play,<ref name="dbbp">[http://www.databasebasketball.com/leaders/leaderscareer.htm?stat=pts&lg=n Career Points], databasebasketball.com, accessed January 16, 2007.</ref> placing him third on the NBA's all-time scoring list behind [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] and [[Karl Malone]].<ref name="dbbp"/>

With five regular-season MVPs (tied for second place with [[Bill Russell]]; only [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] has won more, six), six Finals MVPs (NBA record), and three All-Star MVPs, Jordan is the most decorated player ever to play in the NBA. Jordan finished among the top three in regular-season MVP voting a record 10 times, and was named one of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History]] in 1996.

== Media figure and business interests ==
[[File:Jumpman logo.svg|thumb|200px|The [[Jumpman (logo)|"Jumpman" logo]] is a silhouette of Jordan used by Nike to promote the [[Air Jordan]] shoes, among other merchandise.]]
Jordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history. He has been a major spokesman for such brands as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Chevrolet]], [[Gatorade]], [[McDonald's]], [[Ball Park Franks]], [[Rayovac]], [[Wheaties]], [[Hanes]], and [[MCI Communications|MCI]].<ref name="rov">Rovell, Darren. [http://espn.go.com/sportsbusiness/s/2003/0216/1509936.html "Jordan's 10 greatest commercials ever"], espn.com, February 17, 2003, accessed on January 16, 2007.</ref> Jordan has had a long relationship with Gatorade, appearing in over 20 commercials for the company since 1991, including the "Like Mike" commercials in which a song was sung by children wishing to be like Jordan.<ref name="rov"/><ref>Vancil, Mark. [http://www.nba.com/jordan/hoop_phenomenon.html "Michael Jordan: Phenomenon"], ''Hoop Magazine'', December 1991, accessed March 7, 2007.</ref>

Nike created a signature shoe for him, called the ''[[Air Jordan]]''. One of Jordan's more popular commercials for the shoe involved [[Spike Lee]] playing the part of [[Mars Blackmon]]. In the commercials Lee, as Blackmon, attempted to find the source of Jordan's abilities and became convinced that "it's gotta be the shoes".<ref name="rov"/> The hype and demand for the shoes even brought on a spate of "shoe-jackings" where people were robbed of their sneakers at gunpoint. Subsequently Nike spun off the Jordan line into its own division named the "Jordan Brand". The company features an impressive list of athletes and celebrities as endorsers.<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/53/UGGU.html "Michael Jordan"], forbes.com, accessed February 23, 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.nike.com/jumpman23/home/index.html Team Jordan], nike.com, accessed June 9, 2008.</ref> The brand has also sponsored college sports programs such as those of [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina]], [[University of Cincinnati|Cincinnati]], [[University of California, Berkeley|Cal]], [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's]], [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]], and [[North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University|North Carolina A&T]].

Jordan also has been connected with the [[Looney Tunes]] cartoon characters. A Nike commercial shown during the 1993 [[Super Bowl XXVII]] featured Jordan and [[Bugs Bunny]] playing basketball against a group of Martian characters.<ref>Sandomir, Richard. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE0DF103BF932A05752C0A965958260 SUPER BOWL XXVII; Where the Roman Numerals Dance With the Dollar Signs], ''The New York Times'', January 31, 1993, February 11, 2009.</ref> The Super Bowl commercial inspired the 1996 live action/animated movie ''[[Space Jam]]'', which starred Jordan and Bugs in a fictional story set during his first retirement.<ref name="Porter">Port, David L.

Jordan's yearly income from the endorsements is estimated to be over forty million dollars.<ref name="ausport">[http://fulltext.ausport.gov.au/fulltext/1999/cjsm/v3n1/redenbach31.htm A Multiple Product Endorser can be a Credible Source], Redenbach, Andrew.

"The Wealth Effects Associated with a Celebrity Endorser: The Michael Jordan Phenomenon." ''Journal of Advertising Research'', May, 67<U+2013>73, 1997.</ref>

Most of Jordan's endorsement deals, including the first deal with Nike, were engineered by his agent, [[David Falk]].<ref name=executiveofyear>Powell, Shaun. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_13_223/ai_54296737 "Executive privilege <U+2013> sports agent David Falk"], ''The Sporting News'', March 29, 1999, available online at findarticles.com, accessed July 25, 2007.</ref> Jordan has said of Falk that "he's the best at what he does", and that "marketing-wise, he's great.

In June 2010, Jordan was ranked by [[Forbes Magazine]] as the 20th most powerful celebrity in the world with $55 million earned between June 2009 and June 2010. According to the Forbes article, Brand Jordan generates $1 billion in sales for Nike.<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/53/celeb-100-10_Michael-Jordan_UGGU.html "#20 Michael Jordan"].
