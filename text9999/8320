{{Nihongo|'''''Popotan'''''|<U+307D><U+307D><U+305F><U+3093>}} is a Japanese [[Eroge|adult]] [[visual novel]] developed by [[Petit Ferret]] with [[character design]]s by [[Akio Watanabe]] under the alias Poyoyon<U+2661>Rock. It was originally released as a [[Personal computer game|PC game]] for [[CD-ROM]] on December 13, 2002 and subsequently re-released on [[DVD-ROM]] and for [[PlayStation 2|PlayStation 2 (PS2)]] with the latter removing some of the adult content. A [[fan disc]] for ''Popotan'' by Petit Ferret was also released shortly before the DVD-ROM re-release.

The [[gameplay]] in ''Popotan'' follows a semi-predetermined plot; major events are the same, however, as the game progresses the storylines eventually diverges quite dramatically. The game focuses mostly on the three sisters and it is necessary to finish at least their scenarios before the player can pursue the other girls. Beyond that, the main goal is to make available [[Hentai|sexual scenes and images]] that the player can view or replay at any time depicting the [[protagonist]] having [[sexual intercourse]] with one of the girls.

''Popotan'' has made the transition into other media as well. A [[novel]] series based off the visual novel entitled {{nihongo|''Popotan<U+FF5E> Himitsu no Jumon<U+FF5E> K<U+014D>hen''|<U+307D><U+307D><U+305F><U+3093><U+3000><U+FF5E><U+3072><U+307F><U+3064><U+306E><U+3058><U+3085><U+3082><U+3093><U+FF5E><U+3000><U+5F8C><U+7DE8>}} by Sassami Yachiruda was published by Softgarage; the novels were released in two volumes on June 20 and August 22, 2002. On May 7, 2003 ''[[Magazine Z]]'' announced it would publish a ''Popotan'' manga series by Y<U+016B>jiro Izumi<ref name='Popotan.com May'>{{citeweb|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030622113227/www.popotan.com/1_info/index.html#z|archivedate=2004-05-29|url=http://www.popotan.com/1_info/index.html|title=''Popotan'' TV Animation|work=DVD Information|publisher=Petit Ferret/Popo House|accessdate=2009-02-16|language=Japanese}}</ref> whose story would revolve around the three sisters.<ref name="Petite Ferret 2005">{{citeweb|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051125064456/http://www.petitferret.co.jp/docs/index.htm|archivedate=2005-11-25|url=http://www.petitferret.co.jp/docs/index.htm|title=Official Hompage|publisher=Petite Ferret|accessdate=2008-11-16|language=Japanese}}</ref> There was also a twelve episode [[anime]] directed by [[Shinichiro Kimura]] that originally aired on [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] from July 17 through October 2, 2003. The anime was licensed in North America by [[Geneon Entertainment|Geneon USA]] until Geneon folded in 2008. A radio drama {{nihongo|''Poporaji''|<U+307D><U+307D><U+3089><U+3058>}} was also produced between April and December 2003 and broadcast over [[Osaka Broadcasting Corporation|Osaka Radio]]'s and [[TBS Radio & Communications|TBS Radio]]'s networks and later put on CD. Several art and reference books were released by the franchise as well as other less notable media.

The title, ''Popotan'', is meant to reflect the prominence of dandelions, spelled {{Nihongo|''tanpopo''|<U+305F><U+3093><U+307D><U+307D>}} in [[Japanese language|Japanese]],<ref group=n>In the Japanese language, nouns do not have a separate form in the plural.</ref> in the game; "Popotan" is a nonsensical word and is like literally saying "liondandy".<ref name='Rowena Lim Lei'>{{cite web|last=Lei|first=Rowena Lim|title=''Popotan'' Anime Review|publisher=Anime Jump|url=http://www.animetric.com/nop2/popotan.html|accessdate=2008-12-02}}</ref><ref name="Early Vol1 Popotan Review">{{cite web|last=Beveridge|first=Chris|title=''Popotan'' Vol. #1 (of 3)|publisher=Mania: Beyond Entertainment| date=2004-11-16|url=http://www.mania.com/popotan-vol-1_article_76424.html| accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref><ref name='Popotan Collection Review'>{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Mark|title=''Popotan'' Complete Collection (of 1)|publisher=Mania: Beyond Entertainment| date=2007-08-14|url=http://www.mania.com/popotan-complete-collection_article_79241.html| accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref> It also uses the flipped "-tan" to call the dandelions by name.<ref group=n> In the Japanese language, "-chan" is a suffix added to names for which a child's pronunciation often renders it as "-tan".</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:PopotanPo-Screenshot.png|thumb|left|The game uses character position and size to show the characters' relative relation to the protagonist. Ai (left) is closer while Mii (right) is off to the side of the room further away.]]
Most of ''Popotan'''s [[gameplay]] requires little interaction from the player since a majority of the time is spent reading the text that appears on the game's screen, which represents either [[dialogue]] between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. After progressing through the text, the players will either come to a "decision point" where they must choose from multiple options or the text will end and the player must either move to a new location<ref name="CDGame">{{cite video game|title=Oshiete!

At certain points along Mii's scenario a special [[music video game|music mini-game]] will commence.

''Popotan'' uses over one-thousand [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional computer graphics]]  for backgrounds, events and character poses to engage the player. While only the mouths and eyes are animated, the number of poses is quite large and most minor characters were given the similar treatment as major characters,<ref name="CDGame"/><ref name="DVDROMGame"/><ref name="PS2Game"/> though with fewer major poses to cut costs.<ref name="Costs">{{cite web|last=Yamato|first=Tamaki|url=http://zepy.momotato.com/2008/09/09/eroge-production/|title=Eroge production costs|publisher=Canned Dogs|accessdate=2008-12-14|language=Japanese}}</ref> In addition, the game regularly and actively uses a character placement on screen to display relative position of the characters in relation to the protagonist, including moving them enlarging or shrinking the images to show distance being closer or further away respectively.<ref name="CDGame"/><ref name="DVDROMGame"/><ref name="PS2Game"/>

==Plot==
===Setting and themes===
''Popotan'' takes place sometime in the distant future, though the exact location is unclear because enough [[geologic time|time]] has passed to transform the area. A giant dandelion structure which acts as a [[spire]] pierced the city atop a hill some time ago destroying much of city, though it has recovered by time the game starts. The main location of the game is a European-styled [[mansion]] which is seen as completely out-of-place in the city. While it is the central storyline location, much of the daytime is spent outside the mansion wandering around town attempting to meet characters to trigger event sequences.<ref name="CDGame"/><ref name="DVDROMGame"/><ref name="PS2Game"/>

As indicated by the title, flowers, specifically dandelions, as well as vegetation in general, is a major theme in the game. Various sculptures and buildings were drawn with a flower [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] in mind. Every outdoor and some indoor scenes have vegetation of some type in it. In addition, those that do not have any vegetation have something representing it in them.<ref name="CDGame"/><ref name="DVDROMGame"/><ref name="PS2Game"/>

===Characters===
{{main|List of Popotan characters}}
The player assumes the role of [[List of Popotan characters#Chris|Chris]], the protagonist of ''Popotan''. He is a high school dropout who decided not to get a job because he's turned his back on society. He did this because he said he saw the direction it was heading and didn't like it. Because of this, he has been wandering for some time on the streets now making a living, what little he can, by playing the guitar. generally does not feel up to it without an audience and being a drifter makes that hard.<ref name="Popotan DVD-ROM">{{cite web|url=http://www.getchu.com/soft.phtml?id=24519|title=Popotan Po! info|accessdate=2008-03-25|publisher=Getchu|language= Japanese}}</ref> As the game starts, he is wandering around and happens upon a mansion where he meets three sisters and their maid.

[[List of Popotan characters#Mai|Mai]] is the middle sister. She acts very tomboyish and does not really like Chris staying with them at first. [[List of Popotan characters#Mii|Mii]] is the youngest and by far the most energetic. She often [[cosplay]]s as "Magical Girl Mii". [[List of Popotan characters#Mea|Mea]], their maid, comes off as emotionless at first, but as the game progresses she is shown to have a depth to her. Chris decides to stay with them<ref name="Oshiete"/> as they have cheap rent and he has very little money, though he quickly learns if he is to stay he'll have to change his ways.<ref name="CDGame"/><ref name="DVDROMGame"/><ref name="PS2Game"/>

===Story===
''Popotan''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s story involves Chris's change in lifestyle. In some scenarios, the mysteries surrounding the large hill with the spire-like object are also explored. Chris is a [[slacker]] from out of town who roams around the town doing just enough to get by.<ref name="Wiki-mania DVD">{{cite web|url=http://astore.amazon.co.jp/wikimania-22/detail/B0000CABAF|title=Popotan PO! info|accessdate=2008-03-25|publisher=Wiki-mania|language= Japanese}}</ref> The story opens sometime in the future with Chris near a food stand by a [[torii|shrine entrance]] without money and desperate enough to consider stealing food to just to survive. After this fails he wanders around town looking for someplace to work enough to feed himself and provide shelter. He finds a local [[convenience store]] where he gets directions which eventually lead him to the girls. He then continues to wander around town as he has no place else to go and hardly any money. When he arrives, he invites himself into the mansion and runs into the three sisters and their [[android|human-looking android]] maid. Chris decides to stay after finding out that the place was nice, the rent was cheap and he'd be staying under the same roof as four pretty girls as the only guy; upon learning his intentions about finding a place to stay, the girls agree to let him stay.<ref name="Wiki-mania DVD"/><ref name="CDGame"/><ref name="DVDROMGame"/><ref name="PS2Game"/>

However, the following day he learns he will not be able to continue his slacker lifestyle if he wants to remain and is forced to take a part time job.

The initial release of the CD-ROM version of ''Popotan'' had several critical [[computer bug|errors]] including the inability to get certain girls when following their path correctly and contained severe memory-related problems as well. These issues were quickly resolved with a hotfix on January 10, 2003.<ref name="Petite Ferret FAQ Popotan">{{cite web|url=http://www.petitferret.co.jp/docs/faq/popotan/index.htm|title=Petite Ferret's ''Popotan'' FAQ Page|publisher=Petite Ferret|accessdate=2008-12-09|language=Japanese}}</ref> Future versions of the game were released without such problems.

The initial release of ''Popotan Fan Disc together with A<U+30FB>SO<U+30FB>BO''<ref name="A-So-Bo">{{citeweb|url= http://www.getchu.com/soft.phtml?id=26749|title=''Popotan Fan Disc together with A<U+30FB>SO<U+30FB>BO'' info|publisher=Getchu|accessdate=2008-11-02|language=Japanese}}</ref> also had some issues. Although not as critical as those their parent product contained, they were nonetheless serious. Petit Ferret addressed these issues in two separate patches. The first patch adds missing voice data from the original CD that was intended for the game. The company offered to exchange existing CDs if a customer wanted to send their product in or they could download the necessary files from the website. On July 7, 2003 the company released a final patch for the game which includes grammatical corrections, difficulty fixes and overall stability enhancements. The second patch did not contain the fixes from the first.<ref name="Petite Ferret FAQ A-SO-BO">{{cite web|url=http://www.petitferret.co.jp/docs/faq/asobo/index.htm|title=Petite Ferret's ''Popotan'' A-SO-BO FAQ Page|publisher=Petite Ferret|accessdate=2008-12-09|language=Japanese}}</ref>

To increase pre-order sales, the initial CD-ROM release of ''Popotan'' launched with a special [[maxi single]] CD of the theme songs sung by Under17.<ref name="Moimi"/> The PS2 port of ''Popotan'' was also initially released with a bonus [[theme (arts)|themed]] [[telephone card|calling card]],<ref name="Oshiete!"/> reversible poster and music a CD to help entice early sales.<ref name="new content"/><ref name="Famitsu poster">{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1144920_1124.html|title=''Popotan'' PS2 Poster|accessdate=2008-12-04}}</ref>

''Popotan'' has been hard to classify as it defies any real genre or sub-genre with numerous exceptions to it. Although the anime has an overall comedic tone, the amount varies depending upon whom the episode centers around. It is an [[enigma]] as to what audience the anime was intended for as there is periodic nudity in many episodes,<ref name='Popotan Collection Review'/><ref name="Don Houston 1"/> though no sexually explicit scenes occur on camera.<ref name="Bailey Box"/> In addition, the characters are very light-hearted wanting to help those they meet.<ref name="Don Houston 1"/> Geneon placed an age rating on the series of 16+ because of the nudity and language.<ref name="DVD box cover">{{cite DVD-notes|title=Popotan: Complete Collection|titleyear=2003|director=Shinichiro Kimura|format=bottom box cover|publisher=[[Geneon]]|location=Long Beach, California|publisherid=|year=2004|language=}}</ref>

===Anime===
When the first English DVD was released in the US, ''Popotan'' got mixed reviews. Anime Jump gave it 1 and a 1/2 stars after stating that beyond the pretty pictures, "it is created specifically to sell DVDs, tiny figurines, and other merchandise to [[introvert]]ed adult men."<ref name='Mark Toole'>{{cite web|last=Toole|first=Mike|title=''Popotan'' vol. 1|publisher=Anime Jump|url=http://www.animejump.com/index.php?module=prodreviews&func=showcontent&id=581|accessdate=2008-11-16}}</ref> DVDtalk gave it a final rating of "recommended" with the only real criticism being the DVD's extras. The reviewer remarked that the first disc "[...]was full of surprises for even a jaded old reviewer like myself."<ref name="Don Houston 1"/>

Although the series has negative criticism, particularly from those who only reviewed the first DVD, those who have reviewed the series as a whole have taken a much more favorable stance,<ref name='Mark Toole'/><ref name='Rowena Lim Lei'/> with [[Allmovie]] going so far as to give it 4/5 stars<ref name='AMG: Popotan Series'/> and DVDtalk giving "recommended" to the first two discs and the series as a whole. Several reviewers have also praised the inability to easily classify ''Popotan'' into a specific genre or category of anime.<ref name="Early Vol1 Popotan Review"/><ref name="Don Houston 1"/><ref name="Bailey Box"/><ref name="Don Houston 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/14759/popotan-enigma/|title=Popotan - Enigma|last=Houston|first=Don|work=Reviews|publisher=DVDtalk|date=2005-02-22|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref>

The level of nudity and it's relation to the storyline has been widely contested. While Animetric and Mania have contended it is excessive,<ref name='Rowena Lim Lei'/><ref name='Popotan Collection Review'/> DVDtalk has mixed reviews on it with one claiming the scenes were out-of-place<ref name="Bailey Box"/> while another stated the nudity was fine and appropriate.<ref name="Don Houston 1"/><ref name="Don Houston 2"/>. Both of the latter agree though that the amount was minor.<ref name="Bailey Box"/><ref name="Don Houston 1"/><ref name="Don Houston 2"/>

The character designs by Akio Watanabe and animation in general have been praised even by those who otherwise criticize the series,<ref name='Mark Toole'/><ref name='Rowena Lim Lei'/> with Animetric.com claiming "[c]haracter designs are glossy and distinctive, while scenes are detailed nicely and brightly rendered". The series musical score has also been well received being likened by Animetric.com as "cutesy" and "...complementing the series perfectly."<ref name='Rowena Lim Lei'/>
