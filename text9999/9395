"'''Per Manum'''" is the thirteenth episode of the [[The X-Files (season 8)|eighth season]] of the American [[science fiction on television|science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]''. It premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on {{nowrap|February 18, 2001}}. Written by [[Frank Spotnitz]] and series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], and directed by [[Kim Manners]], the episode helps to explore the series' overarching [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. "Per Manum" received a [[Nielsen rating]] of 9.4 and was watched by 9.61 million households. Overall, the episode received mixed reviews from critics.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[John Doggett]] and [[Dana Scully]] who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. In the episode Scully and Doggett investigate several women who had no way of naturally conceiving but who claim to have been abducted and impregnated with alien babies. Soon, Scully begins to worry about the future of her pregnancy.

"Per Manum" was the first season eight episode of ''The X-Files'' to feature a substantial appearance of Fox Mulder since the season premiere "[[Within (The X-Files)|Within]]"/"[[Without (The X-Files)|Without]]". In addition, the episode marks the first appearance of [[Knowle Rohrer]], played by [[Adam Baldwin]], who would become Doggett's informant and later betrayer.

== Plot ==

Pregnant Kathy McCready is undergoing an emergency caesarian. As her husband prepares, the ward is locked down, and the child delivered is seen to be an [[Colonist (The X-Files)|alien]].

FBI special agents [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) meet Duffy Haskell ([[Jay Acovone]]), who tells them about his wife<U+2014>a multiple-abductee who he believes was killed by her doctors upon giving birth to an alien child. He also describes how his wife's cancer was both caused and cured by her abductors. Duffy refers the agents to Zeus Genetics, and shows them an ultrasound scan that seems to vindicate his story. As the agents leave, Doggett notes similarities between the case and Scully's history, although he does not yet know that Scully is pregnant. Scully investigates a Zeus Genetics clinic, overhearing a pregnant woman, Mary Hendershot ([[Saxon Trainor]]), telling her doctor that she does not want to be under his care any more. Scully hides in a storeroom, finding it full of preserved fetuses that resemble the alien child seen earlier.

In a flashback, [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) tells Scully that her abduction (in the [[The X-Files (season 2)|second season]] episodes "[[Ascension (The X-Files)|Ascension]] and "[[One Breath]]") has rendered her infertile, as her ova were harvested for genetic experiments. Mulder later found them in a secret facility (in [[The X-Files (season 4)|fourth season]]'s "[[Memento Mori (The X-Files)|Memento Mori]]"), but they were not viable. Scully seeks a second opinion from her doctor, Dr. Parenti, and is told that her ova might be viable with a sperm donor. Mulder volunteers for the role.

Back in the present, Scully phones Parenti, who is dissecting an alien fetus. She asks him to compare her ultrasound scan with the one given to her earlier. When she visits later, she is assured her scans are in order, but she sees Parenti speaking with Dr. Lev, the doctor she overheard at Zeus Genetics. [[Walter Skinner]] ([[Mitch Pileggi]]) and Doggett confront Duffy about threatening letters he has been sending to both Mulder and Dr. Lev. However, when the agents leave, Duffy makes a phone call to Lev, warning him that they are being investigated.

Scully is warned by Hendershot, the woman from Zeus Genetics, that their unborn children are in danger. Scully meets Doggett and Skinner, having requested a leave of absence from the FBI. After Doggett leaves, Skinner tries to convince Scully to reveal her pregnancy to Doggett. Scully and Hendershot visit an army research hospital to have an ultrasound performed on Hendershot. The scan appears normal, but Scully realises the monitor they are watching is simply a video of another woman's scan.

Doggett has Duffy's fingerprints examined, and finds that they belong to a man who died thirty years previously. Doggett contacts an old military partner, [[Knowle Rohrer]] ([[Adam Baldwin]]) to find Duffy's real identity. Although Rohrer assures Doggett he will investigate, the agent is not convinced, believing that Rohrer is a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent. He confides this to Skinner, who tells him to aid Scully at the military hospital. As Scully and Hendershot sneak out of the building, they are found by Rohrer and several [[United States Marine Corps|marines]], claiming Doggett has sent them to rescue her. Scully and Hendershot are driven away, but Hendershot enters labour. The women are separated, and Scully is drugged. When she wakens, Doggett informs her that Hendershot's baby was delivered and is normal. However, Scully is convinced something is amiss, but nothing more can be done about it. In another flashback, Scully tells Mulder that her attempt at [[In vitro fertilisation|''in vitro'' fertilization]] has failed, but he simply tells her to keep trying.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/xfiles/episodeguide/eight/page13.shtml |title=Per Manum |publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref>

==Production==
"Per Manum" featured the appearance of [[David Duchovny]] as Fox Mulder in various flashbacks. After settling his contract dispute with Fox, Duchovny quit full-time participation in the show after the [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh season]].<ref name=bbcnews>{{cite web |author=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1337685.stm |title=Duchovny quits X-Files |work=BBC News |date=May 18, 2001 |accessdate=July 5, 2009}}</ref> In order to explain Mulder's absence, Duchovny's character was abducted by aliens in the seventh season finale, "[[Requiem (The X-Files)|Requiem]]". After several rounds of contractual discussions, Duchovny agreed to return for a total of 11 season eight episodes.<ref name=space>{{cite web |author=Elber, Lynn |url=http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/tv/xfiles_duchovny_000518_wg.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040924004848/http://space.com/sciencefiction/tv/xfiles_duchovny_000518_wg.html |archivedate=September 24, 2004 |title=Fox Mulder 'Ready to Get Back to Work' |work=Associated Press / Space |date=May 18, 2000 |accessdate=July 5, 2009}}</ref> "Per Manum" marked the third appearance of Duchovny in the eighth season; he had previously appeared in opening episodes of the season, "[[Within (The X-Files)|Within]]" and "[[Without (The X-Files)|Without]]".<ref name="within">{{Cite episode | episodelink=Within (The X-Files) | title = Within | series = The X-Files | serieslink = The X-Files |credits= [[Kim Manners]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | airdate =November 5, 2001 | season = 8 | number = 1}}</ref><ref name="without">{{Cite episode | episodelink=Without (The X-Files) | title = Without | series = The X-Files | serieslink = The X-Files | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |credits= [[Kim Manners]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (writer) | airdate =November 12, 2001 | season = 8 | number = 2}}</ref> Series creator [[Chris Carter]] later argued that Mulder's absences from the series did not affect the characterization, noting that "there are characters who can be powerful as absent centers, as Mulder was through the eight and ninth seasons."<ref name="Bigbook">Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 189</ref>

A deleted scene from early on within the episode, in which Scully questions her doctor about her ultrasound scans, was cut from the final broadcast as writer [[Frank Spotnitz]] felt it was too "confusing" for the viewers to place doubt on the actions of the doctor so early. Fellow series writer [[John Shiban]] said that the scene was not "subtle" enough to convey the right level of suspicion.<ref name="delete">{{cite video |title=Deleted Scenes: Per Manum |work=[[The X-Files (season 8)|The X-Files: The Complete Eighth Season]] |titleyear=2000<U+2013>2001 |people=[[John Shiban]] & [[Frank Spotnitz]] (narrators) |format=featurette|publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Corporation|Fox]]}}</ref> Spotnitz has described "Per Manum" as being "a real paranoia episode", concerning "the way you perceive connections between people, what are they saying, and is it suspicious or not".<ref name="delete"/>

[[Adam Baldwin]], who makes his first appearance as recurring character Knowle Rohrer, originally auditioned for the part of John Dogget, losing out to Robert Patrick. However, the crew remembered Baldwin's audition later when casting "Per Manum", and asked him to play the role.<ref name="randomroles">{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/adam-baldwin,23287/ |title=Adam Baldwin {{!}} TV {{!}} Random Roles |first=Steve |last=Heisler |date= February 2, 2009 |accessdate=February 17, 2012 |publisher=''[[The A.V.

"Per Manum" received mostly positive reviews from critics, with one detractor. Writing for [[Television Without Pity]], Jessica Morgan rated the episode a B+, deriding some of the episode's plot points, such as the hospital's locking doors, and questioning the villainy of the antagonistic doctors.<ref name="TWP">{{cite web |url=http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/the-xfiles/per-manum.php?page=1 |title=X-Files TV Show - Per Manum - X-Files Recaps, X-Files Reviews, X-Files Episodes |publisher=[[Television Without Pity]] |first=Jessica |last=Morgan |date=February 21, 2001 |accessdate=January 5, 2012}}</ref> Tom Kessenich, in his book ''Examinations: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6-9 of 'The X-Files''', noted that the episode typifyes the basic themes of the series<U+2014>"dark, foreboding terror, overriding sense of paranoia" and "the fear of the unknown" among others.<ref name="book_part_two">Kessenich, p.156.</ref> Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book ''Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen'', rated the episode five stars out of five, calling it a "return to form" for the series. Shearman and Pearson also felt that the episode gave the character of John Doggett a chance to be accepted by the series' other characters; and praised the "subtle" writing of the episode's emotional dialogue.<ref>Shearman and Pearson, pp. 239<U+2013>240</ref> Writing for ''[[The Vindicator]]'', Eric Mink felt that the episode was "intense, unsettling, sometimes gross, and suspenseful to the point of nerve-racking {{sic}}", feeling that its plot would "resonate instantly and ominously with viewers".<ref name="vind">{{cite news |title=Once again, 'The X-Files' offers little more than a Mulder sighting |first=Eric |last=Mink  |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bHhIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7IIMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3716,704750&dq=x+files&hl=en  |newspaper=[[The Vindicator]] |page=B11 |date=February 17, 2001 |accessdate=March 22, 2012}}</ref>

Not all reviews were positive. Paula Vitaris from ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' gave the episode a scathing review and awarded it no stars out of four.<ref name=cinepaula>{{cite journal|last=Vitaris|first=Paula|title=The X-Files Season Eight Episode Guide|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|date=April 2002|volume=34|issue=2|accessdate=29 March 2012|page=42-49}}</ref> She heavily derided the plot, noting that Haskell's role as an "undercover operative" was not convincing. Furthermore, she reasoned that because the plot twists were so expected, Scully came off as "a moron".<ref name=cinepaula/> Vitaris also criticized the use of flashbacks, noting that they were "the only way ''The X-Files'' writers could figure out to use David Duchovny".<ref name=cinepaula/>
