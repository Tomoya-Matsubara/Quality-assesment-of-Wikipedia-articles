'''90377 Sedna''' is a [[trans-Neptunian object]] discovered in 2003, which as of 2010 lies about three times as far from the Sun as [[Neptune]]. However, its farthest orbital distance from the Sun is estimated to be 960&nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s (AU): for the majority of its orbit, it is the most distant known object in the [[Solar System]] after long-period [[comet]]s.{{ref_label|B|b|none}}

Roughly two-thirds the size of [[Pluto]], Sedna is hypothetically large enough to be rounded by its own gravity, and thus would qualify as a [[dwarf planet]] under current definitions. However, its distance from the Sun makes determining its shape difficult. [[Spectroscopy]] has revealed that Sedna's surface composition is very similar to that of other trans-Neptunian objects, being largely a mixture of various [[volatiles|ices]], including water, [[methane]] and [[nitrogen]]. Its surface is one of the reddest in the Solar System.

Sedna's exceptionally long and elongated orbit, taking approximately 12,000 years to complete, and distant point of closest approach to the Sun, at 76&nbsp;AU, have led to much speculation as to its origin. The [[Minor Planet Center]] currently places Sedna in the [[scattered disc]], a group of objects sent into highly elongated orbits by the gravitational influence of [[Neptune]]. However, this classification has been contested, as Sedna never comes close enough to Neptune to have been scattered by it, leading some astronomers to conclude that it is in fact the first known member of the inner [[Oort cloud]]. Others speculate that it might have been tugged into its current orbit by a passing star, perhaps one within the Sun's birth cluster, or even that it was captured from another star system. Another hypothesis suggests that its orbit may be evidence for a large [[Planets beyond Neptune|planet beyond the orbit of Neptune]]. Astronomer [[Mike Brown (astronomer)|Mike Brown]], who co-discovered Sedna, claims it is the most scientifically important [[trans-Neptunian object]] found to date, as understanding its peculiar orbit is likely to yield valuable information about the origin and early evolution of the Solar System.<ref name=fussman>{{cite web|title=The Man Who Finds Planets|author=Cal  Fussman|work=Discover|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2006/may/cover|year=2006|accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>

==Discovery and naming==
Sedna ([[provisional designation|provisionally designated]] '''{{mp|2003 VB|12}}''') was  discovered by [[Michael E. Brown|Mike  Brown]] ([[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]), [[Chad Trujillo]] ([[Gemini Observatory]]) and [[David L. Rabinowitz|David Rabinowitz]] ([[Yale University]]) as part of a survey begun in 2001 with the [[Samuel Oschin telescope]] at [[Palomar Observatory]] near [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[California]] using Yale's 160 megapixel [[Palomar_Observatory#QUEST|Palomar Quest camera]]. On November 14, 2003, an object was observed to move by 4.6 [[Minute of arc|arcseconds]] over 3.1 hours relative to stars, which indicated that its distance was about 100&nbsp;AU. Follow-up observations in November<U+2013>December 2003 with the SMARTS telescope at the [[Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory]] in [[Chile]] as well as with the Tenagra IV telescope at the [[W. M. Keck Observatory]] in [[Hawaii]] revealed that the object was moving along a distant highly [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] orbit. Later the object was identified on older [[precovery]] images made by the Samuel Oschin telescope as well on images from [[Near Earth Asteroid Tracking]] consortium. These previous positions expanded its known orbital arc and allowed a more precise calculation of its orbit.<ref name=Mike/>

"Our newly discovered object is the coldest most distant place known in the Solar System," said Mike Brown on his website, "so we feel it is appropriate to name it in honour of [[Sedna (deity)|Sedna]], the [[Inuit mythology|Inuit goddess]] of the sea, who is thought to live at the bottom of the frigid [[Arctic Ocean]]."<ref name=mikebrown/> Brown also suggested to the [[International Astronomical Union]]'s (IAU) [[Minor Planet Center]] that any future objects discovered in Sedna's orbital region should also be named from [[Inuit]] mythologies.<ref name=mikebrown/> The team made the name "Sedna" public before the object had been officially numbered.<ref name=mpc>{{cite web|title=MPEC 2004-S73 : Editorial Notice|publisher=IAU Minor Planet Center|url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/mpec/K04/K04S73.html|year=2004|accessdate=2010-07-18}}</ref> [[Brian Marsden]], the head of the Minor Planet Center, complained that such an action was a violation of protocol, and that some members of the IAU might vote against it.<ref>{{cite news|title=How do planets get their names?|author=Duncan Walker|work= BBC News|year=2004|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3515658.stm|accessdate=2010-05-22 | date=2004-03-16}}</ref> However, no objection was raised as to the name itself, and no competing names were suggested. The MPC formally accepted the name in September, 2004,<ref name=mpc/> and  also considered that, in similar cases of extraordinary interest, it might in future allow names to be announced before they were officially numbered.<ref name=mpc/>

==Orbit and rotation==
Barring [[comet]]s, Sedna has the longest [[orbital period]] of any known object in the Solar System, calculated at between 11,800 and 12,100 years.<ref name=DES/> This represents a [[Curve fitting|best-fit]] solution, as Sedna has only been observed over a brief part of its orbital [[Arc (geometry)|arc]]. Its [[orbit]] is extremely [[ellipse|elliptical]], with an [[aphelion]] estimated at 960&nbsp;[[astronomical unit|AU]] and a [[perihelion]] at about 76&nbsp;AU. At its discovery it was approaching perihelion at 89.6 AU<ref name=AstDys2003>{{cite web

Although the orbits of some long-period comets extend farther than that of Sedna, they are too dim to be discovered except when approaching perihelion in the inner Solar System.

Trujillo and colleagues have placed upper limits of 60% for methane ice in Sedna's surface composition and 70% for water ice.<ref name="Trujillo2005"/>  Barucci, Cruikshank and colleagues compared Sedna's spectrum with that of [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] and detected weak [[absorption bands]] belonging to methane and nitrogen ices.

In their paper announcing the discovery of Sedna, Mike Brown and his colleagues described it as the first observed body belonging to the [[Oort cloud]], the hypothetical cloud of [[comets]] believed to exist nearly a light-year from the Sun. They observed that, unlike [[scattered disc]] objects such as [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], Sedna's perhihelion (76&nbsp;AU) is too distant for it to have been scattered by the gravitational influence of Neptune.<ref name=Mike>{{cite journal|title=Discovery of a Candidate Inner Oort Cloud Planetoid|author=Mike Brown, David Rabinowitz, Chad Trujillo|journal=Astrophysical Journal|year=2004 |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ApJ...617..645B|year=2004|volume=617|number=1|pages=645<U+2013>649|issue=1|id={{arxiv|astro-ph|0404456}}|doi=10.1086/422095}}</ref> Because it is a great deal closer to the Sun than was expected for an Oort cloud object, and has an [[inclination]] roughly in line with the planets and the Kuiper belt, they described the planetoid as being an inner Oort cloud object, situated in the disc reaching from the Kuiper belt to the spherical part of the cloud.<ref name="Swiss">{{cite book|authors=David Jewitt, Alessandro Morbidelli, Heike Rauer|year=2007|title=Trans-Neptunian Objects and Comets: Saas-Fee Advanced Course 35.

Mike and his team favoured the hypothesis that Sedna was lifted into its current orbit by a star from the Sun's birth cluster, arguing that Sedna's aphelion of about 1000&nbsp;AU, which is relatively close compared to those of long period comets, is not distant enough to be affected by passing stars, as Oort cloud objects are hypothesised to be.

The [[trans-Neptunian planet]] hypothesis has been advanced in several forms by a number of astronomers, including Gomes and Patryk Lykawka. One scenario involves perturbations of Sedna's orbit by a hypothetical planetary-sized body in the inner [[Oort cloud]]. Recent simulations show that Sedna's orbital characteristics could be explained by perturbations by a Neptune-mass object at 2000&nbsp;AU (or less), a Jupiter-mass at 5000 AU, or even an Earth-mass object at 1000 AU.<ref name="Gomez 2006" >

It has been suggested that Sedna's orbit is the result of influence by a large binary companion to the Sun, thousands of AU distant. One such hypothetical companion is [[Nemesis (star)|Nemesis]], a dim [[Binary star system|companion]] to the Sun which has been proposed to be responsible for the periodicity of [[Extinction event|mass extinctions]] on Earth from cometary impacts, the lunar impact record, and the common orbital elements of a number of long period comets.<ref name="Gomez 2006"/><ref name=Cruttenden>{{cite web|author=Staff|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Evidence_Mounts_For_Companion_Star_To_Our_Sun.html|title=Evidence Mounts For Companion Star To Our Sun|work=SpaceDaily|date= April 25, 2006|accessdate=November 27, 2009}}</ref> [[John J. Matese]] and [[ Daniel P. Whitmire]], longtime proponents of the possibility of a wide binary companion to the Sun, have suggested that an object of five times the mass of Jupiter lying at roughly 7850 AU from the Sun could produce a body in Sedna's orbit.<ref>{{cite journal|title= A Widebinary Solar Companion as a Possible Origin of Sedna-like Objects|author=John J.

Morbidelli and Kenyon have suggested that Sedna may not have originated in our Solar System, but was captured by the Sun from a passing star, specifically a [[brown dwarf]] about 20 times [[Solar mass|less massive than the Sun]].<ref name=Morbidelli2004/><ref name=Kenyon2004/>

==Population==
[[File:Web print-1-.jpg|thumb|Artist's conception of the Sun, as seen from Sedna|alt=the Sun appears merely as a point of light, distended by dust. The surface of Sedna is red ice, dimly glimmering in the noontime sunlight]]
Sedna's highly elliptical orbit meant that the probability of its detection was roughly one in 60, suggesting that, unless its discovery  was a fluke, another 40<U+2013>160 Sedna-sized objects should exist within its region.<ref name=largest/> Another object, {{mpl|2000 CR|105}}, has an orbit similar to Sedna's but less extreme: perihelion is 44.3&nbsp;AU, aphelion is 394&nbsp;AU, and the orbital period is 3240&nbsp;years; it may have been affected by the same processes as Sedna.<ref name=Morbidelli2004/>

Each of the proposed mechanisms for Sedna's extreme orbit would leave a distinct mark on the structure and dynamics of any wider population. If a trans-Neptunian planet was responsible, all such objects would share roughly the same perihelion (~80&nbsp;AU). If Sedna were captured from another star system that rotated in the same direction as the Solar System, then Sedna's population would all possess relatively low inclinations and range from 100<U+2013>500&nbsp;AU. If it rotated in the opposite direction, then two populations would form, one with low inclinations and one with high. The gravity of other stars would produce a wide range of perihelia and inclinations, each dependent on the number and angle of such encounters.<ref name=sisters/>

Gaining a larger sample of such objects therefore could help in determining which scenario is most likely.<ref name=Schwamb/> "I call Sedna a fossil record of the earliest Solar System", said Brown in 2006. "Eventually, when other fossil records are found, Sedna will help tell us how the Sun formed and the number of stars that were close to the Sun when it formed."<ref name=fussman/> A 2007<U+2013>2008 survey by Brown, Rabinowitz and Megan Schwamb attempted to locate another member of Sedna's hypothetical population. Although the survey was sensitive to movement out to 1000&nbsp;AU and discovered the dwarf planet candidate {{mpl|2007 OR|10}}, it detected no new bodies in Sedna-like orbits.<ref name=Schwamb>{{cite journal|title=A Search for Distant Solar System Bodies in the Region of Sedna|authors=Megan E. Schwamb, Michael E. Brown, and David L. Rabinowitz|year=2009|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|volume=694 |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...694L..45S|id={{arxiv|0901.4173}}|pages=L45<U+2013>L48|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/694/1/L45}}</ref> Subsequent simulations incorporating the new data suggested that a total of about 40 Sedna-sized objects probably exist in this region.<ref name=Schwamb/>

==Classification==

The [[Minor Planet Center]], which officially catalogs the objects in the Solar System, classifies Sedna as a scattered object.<ref name=MPC>{{cite web|url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/lists/Centaurs.html|title=List of Centaurs and Scattered-Disk Objects|publisher=Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics|date=2008-07-02|author=IAU: Minor Planet Center|accessdate=2008-07-02}}</ref> However, this grouping is heavily questioned, and many astronomers have suggested that it, together with a few other objects  (e.g. {{mpl|2000 CR|105}}), be placed in a new category of distant objects named ''extended scattered disc objects'' (E-SDO),<ref name="Gladman">{{cite web|author=Brett Gladman|publisher=Observatoire de la Cote d'Azur|url=http://www.obs-nice.fr/gladman/cr105.html|title=Evidence for an Extended Scattered Disk?|year=2001 |accessdate=2010-07-22}}</ref> ''[[detached object]]s'',<ref name="Jewitt2006">{{cite book|authors=[[David Jewitt]], A.

The discovery of Sedna resurrected the question of which astronomical objects should be considered [[planet]]s and which should not.  On March 15, 2004, articles in the popular press reported that a tenth planet had been discovered. This question was answered under the new [[International Astronomical Union]] [[IAU definition of planet|definition of a planet]], adopted on August 24, 2006, which mandated that a planet must have [[cleared the neighborhood]] around its orbit. Sedna has a Stern<U+2013>Levison parameter estimated to be much less than 1,{{ref_label|D|d|none}} and therefore cannot be considered to have cleared the neighborhood, even though no other objects have yet been discovered in its vicinity. It is unknown whether or not Sedna is in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. If it is, as is currently suspected,<ref name=Brown>{{cite web

==Exploration==
Sedna's perihelion will be reached within this century, after which it will move back out and farther away from the Sun again for another ~12,000 years.  Though an exploration target within the Solar System,<ref>

This is much less than 1, so Sedna is not a planet by this criterion.
