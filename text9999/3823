The Australian Paralympic snowboarding coach Peter Higgins identified Badenhorst as likely snowboarder after the London Games, and she commenced training in this sport. In taking up snowboarding, she needed a new custom-made leg. Badenhorst said: "I need a special leg that has to be engineered differently to accommodate the different pressures and angles of snowboarding".<ref name=areanews>{{cite news|last=Pattison|first=Tanya|title=Joany reaches for new heights|url=http://www.areanews.com.au/story/1385329/joany-reaches-for-new-heights/|accessdate=10 February 2014|newspaper=Area News|date=25 March 2013}}</ref>
