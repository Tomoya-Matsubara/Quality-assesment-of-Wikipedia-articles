'''Washington, D.C.''' ({{pron-en|<U+02C8>w<U+0252><U+0283><U+026A><U+014B>t<U+0259>n <U+02CC>di<U+02D0><U+02C8>si<U+02D0>}}), formally the '''District of Columbia''' and commonly referred to as '''Washington''', '''the District''', or simply '''D.C.''', is the capital of the [[United States]] founded on July 16, 1790. The [[Article One of the United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] allows for the creation of a special district to serve as the permanent national capital. The District is therefore not a part of any [[U.S. state]] and is instead directly overseen by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. Within the District, a new capital city was founded in 1791 and named in honor of [[George Washington]]. The City of Washington, along with [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] and [[Washington County, D.C.|outlying areas]] within the federal district, were placed under a single, unified government following an [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871|act of Congress in 1871]]. It is for this reason that the city, while legally named the District of Columbia, is known as Washington, D.C. The city shares its name with the U.S. state of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] located on the country's Pacific coast.

The District is located on the north bank of the [[Potomac River]] and is bordered by the states of [[Virginia]] to the southwest and [[Maryland]] to the other sides. The city has a resident population of 601,723; because of commuters from the surrounding suburbs, its population rises to over one&nbsp;million during the workweek. The [[Washington Metropolitan Area]], of which the District is a part, has a population of 5.4&nbsp;million, the [[Table of United States Metropolitan Statistical Areas|eighth-largest]] [[United States metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] in the country.

The centers of all three branches of the U.S. federal government are located in the District, as are many of the nation's monuments and museums. Washington, D.C. hosts 174 [[List of diplomatic missions in the United States|foreign embassies]] as well as the headquarters of the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], and the [[Pan American Health Organization]] (PAHO). The headquarters of other institutions such as trade unions, [[lobbying]] groups, and professional associations are also located in the District.

Washington, D.C., is governed by a [[List of mayors of Washington, D.C.|mayor]] and a 13-member [[Council of the District of Columbia|city council]]. However, the [[United States Congress]] has supreme authority over the city and may overturn local laws. Residents of the District therefore have less self-governance than residents of the states. The District has a non-voting, at-large Congressional [[Delegate (United States Congress)|delegate]], but no senators. D.C. residents could not vote in [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]] until the ratification of the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1961.

[[James Madison]] expounded the need for a federal district on January 23, 1788, in his "[[Federalist No. 43]]", arguing that the national capital needed to be distinct from the states in order to provide for its own maintenance and safety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/home/fedpapers/fed_43.html |title=The Federalist No. 43 |accessdate=2008-05-31 |last=Madison |first=James |date=1996-04-30 |work=The Independent Journal |publisher=Library of Congress }}</ref> An attack on the Congress at [[Philadelphia]] by a mob of angry soldiers, known as the [[Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783]], had emphasized the need for the government to see to its own security.<ref>{{cite book |last=Crew |first=Harvey W. |coauthors=William Bensing Webb, John Wooldridge |title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D.

In what later became known as the [[Compromise of 1790]], Madison, [[Alexander Hamilton]], and [[Thomas Jefferson]] came to an agreement that the federal government would assume war debt carried by the states, on the condition that the new national capital would be located in the [[Southern United States]].{{Ref|debts|[a]}}

On July 16, 1790, the [[Residence Act]] provided for a new permanent capital to be located on the [[Potomac River]], the exact area to be selected by President [[George Washington|Washington]].{{Ref|geog|[b]}} As permitted by the U.S. Constitution, the initial shape of the federal district was a square, measuring {{convert|10|mi|km|}} on each side, totaling {{convert|100|sqmi|km2|}}.

On September 9, 1791, the federal city was named in honor of [[George Washington]], and the district was named the Territory of Columbia, [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] being a poetic name for the United States in use at that time.{{Ref|name|[c]}} Congress held its first session in Washington on November 17, 1800.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/The_Senate_Moves_to_Washington.htm |title=The Senate Moves to Washington |accessdate=2008-07-11 |date=2006-02-14 |publisher=[[United States Senate]] }}</ref>

The [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801|Organic Act of 1801]] officially organized the District of Columbia and placed the entire federal territory, including the cities of Washington, Georgetown, and Alexandria, under the exclusive control of Congress.

On August 24<U+2013>25, 1814, in a raid known as the [[Burning of Washington]], British forces invaded the capital during the [[War of 1812]], following the [[Battle of York|sacking and burning]] of [[York, Upper Canada|York]] (modern-day [[Toronto]]).

Since 1800, the District's residents have protested their lack of [[District of Columbia voting rights|voting representation]] in Congress. To correct this, various proposals have been offered to return the land ceded to form the District back to Maryland and Virginia.

[[File:L'Enfant plan.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pierre Charles L'Enfant|L'Enfant's]] plan for Washington, D.C., as revised by [[Andrew Ellicott]] (1792)]]

Washington, D.C. is a [[New town|planned city]]. The design for the City of Washington was largely the work of [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant|Pierre (Peter) Charles L<U+2019>Enfant]], a French-born architect, engineer, and city planner who first arrived in the colonies as a [[military engineer]] with [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Major General Lafayette]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].{{Ref|L'Enfant|[d]}} In 1791, President Washington commissioned L'Enfant to plan the layout of the new capital city.<ref name=lenfant /> At L<U+2019>Enfant<U+2019>s request, Thomas Jefferson provided plans of cities such as [[Amsterdam]], [[Paris]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Milan]], which he had brought back from Europe in 1788.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consource.org/index.asp?bid=582&fid=600&documentid=59106|title=The Papers of George Washington: Presidential Series, 8|publisher=The Constitutional Sources Project|accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref> The plan for Washington was modeled in the [[Baroque]] style and incorporated avenues radiating out from rectangles, providing room for open space and landscaping.<ref name=lenfant /> L'Enfant's design also envisioned a garden-lined "grand avenue" approximately {{convert|1|mi|km}} in length and {{convert|400|ft|m}} wide in the area that is now the [[National Mall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/62wash/62locate1.htm|title=Map 1: The L'Enfant Plan for Washington|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2009-10-27}}</ref>

In March 1792, President Washington dismissed L'Enfant due to his insistence on micromanaging the city's planning, which had resulted in conflicts with the three commissioners appointed by Washington to supervise the capital's construction. [[Andrew Ellicott]], who had worked with L'Enfant surveying the city, was then commissioned to complete the plans. Though Ellicott made revisions to the original plans, including changes to some street patterns, L'Enfant is still credited with the overall design of the city.<ref>{{cite book |last=Crew |first=Harvey W. |coauthors=William Bensing Webb, John Wooldridge |title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D.

By the start of the 20th century, L'Enfant's vision of a capital with open parks and grand national monuments had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings, including a railroad station on the National Mall.<ref name=lenfant>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/wash/lenfant.htm |title=The L'Enfant and McMillan Plans |accessdate=2008-05-27 |publisher=[[National Park Service]] }}</ref> In 1900, Congress formed a [[joint committee]], headed by Senator [[James McMillan (politician)|James McMillan]], charged with beautifying Washington's ceremonial core. What became known as the [[McMillan Plan]] was finalized in 1901. It included the re-landscaping of the Capitol grounds and the Mall, constructing new Federal buildings and monuments, clearing slums, and establishing a new citywide park system. Architects recruited by the committee kept much of the city's original layout, and their work is thought to be largely in keeping with L'Enfant's intended design.<ref name=lenfant />

The architecture of Washington varies greatly. Six of the top 10 buildings in the [[American Institute of Architects]]' 2007 ranking of "[[America's Favorite Architecture]]" are located in the District of Columbia:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://favoritearchitecture.org/afa150.php |title=America's Favorite Architecture |accessdate=2008-07-03 |year=2007 |publisher=American Institute of Architects and Harris Interactive }}</ref> the [[White House]]; the [[Washington National Cathedral]]; the [[Thomas Jefferson Memorial]]; the [[United States Capitol]]; the [[Lincoln Memorial]]; and the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]].

Outside downtown Washington, architectural styles are even more varied. Historic buildings are designed primarily in the [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne]], [[Ch<U+00E2>teauesque]], [[Richardsonian Romanesque]], Georgian revival, [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]], and a variety of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] styles.

Unique among cities with a [[List of U.S. cities with large African American populations|high percentage of African Americans]], Washington has had a significant black population since the city's creation. This is partly a result of the [[manumission]] of slaves in the [[Upland South|Upper South]] after the [[American Revolutionary War]].

Like most large cities, crime is highest in areas associated with illegal drugs and gangs. The more affluent neighborhoods of Northwest Washington experience low levels of crime, but the incidence of crime generally increases as one goes further east. Once plagued with violent crime, many D.C. neighborhoods such as [[Columbia Heights, Washington, D.C.|Columbia Heights]] and [[Logan Circle, Washington, D.C.|Logan Circle]] are becoming safe and vibrant areas due to overall trends of reduced crime in the District and also through the effects of [[gentrification]]. As a result, however, experts point to the city's changing demographics as a reason why crime in the District is being overshadowed by increased violence further east across the border in [[Prince George's County, Maryland]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Shewfelt |title=Baltimore, Prince George's Reign as State's Murder Capitals |date=2007-04-24 |url=http://somd.com/news/headlines/2007/5809.shtml |work=Southern Maryland |accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>

[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One, Section Eight of the United States Constitution]] grants the U.S. Congress ultimate authority over Washington, D.C. The District of Columbia did not have an elected municipal government until the passage of the [[District of Columbia Home Rule Act|1973 Home Rule Act]]. The Act devolved certain Congressional powers over the District to a local government administered by an elected mayor, currently [[Adrian Fenty]], and the thirteen-member [[Council of the District of Columbia]]. However, Congress retains the right to review and overturn laws created by the city council and intervene in local affairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/history|title=History of Self-Government in the District of Columbia|year=2008|publisher=Council of the District of Columbia|accessdate=2008-12-29}}</ref>

{{Refbegin|colwidth=60em}}
{{note|debts|[a]}} By 1790, the Southern states had largely repaid their overseas debts from the Revolutionary War. The Northern states had not, and wanted the new federal government to take over their outstanding liabilities. As this would effectively mean that the Southern states would assume a share of the Northern debt, in return, the South lobbied for a federal capital located closer to their own agricultural and slave-holding interests. See: {{cite book |last=Crew |first=Harvey W. |coauthors=William Bensing Webb, John Wooldridge |title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D. C. |publisher=United Brethren Publishing House |year=1892 |location=[[Dayton, Ohio]] |url=http://books.google.com/?id=5Q81AAAAIAAJ |page=124 }}<br />
{{note|geog|[b]}}The Residence Act allowed the President to select a location within Maryland as far east as the Anacostia River. However, Washington shifted the federal territory's borders to the southeast in order to include the city of Alexandria at the District's southern tip. In 1791, Congress amended the Residence Act to approve the new site, including territory ceded by Virginia. See: {{cite book |last=Crew |first=Harvey W. |coauthors=William Bensing Webb, John Wooldridge |title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D. C. |publisher=United Brethren Publishing House |year=1892 |location=[[Dayton, Ohio]] |url=http://books.google.com/?id=5Q81AAAAIAAJ |pages=89<U+2013>92 }}<br />
{{note|name|[c]}}The terms "territory" and "district" were used interchangeably throughout the 19th century until the territory was officially renamed the District of Columbia in 1871. See: {{cite web|url=http://www.historydc.org/aboutdc.aspx |title=Get to know D.C. |accessdate=2010-08-31 |publisher=The Historical Society of Washington, D.C. }}<br />
{{note|L'Enfant|[d]}}L'Enfant identified himself as "Peter Charles L'Enfant" during most of his life, while residing in the United States. See: {{cite book|last=Bowling|first=Kenneth R.|title=Peter Charles L'Enfant: Vision, Honor, and Male Friendship in the Early American Republic|publisher=The George Washington University|location=Washington, D.C.|year=2002}}<br />
