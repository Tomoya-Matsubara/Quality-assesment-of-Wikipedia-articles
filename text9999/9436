==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Russia}}
The Russian Federation stretches across a large extent of the north of the super-continent of [[Eurasia]]. Because of its size, Russia displays both monotony and diversity. As with its topography, its climates, vegetation, and soils span vast distances.<ref name=climate>{{cite web|title=Russia::Climate and vegetation|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-207542|accessdate=2007-07-03}}</ref> From north to south the [[East European Plain]] is clad sequentially in [[tundra]], coniferous forest ([[taiga]]), mixed and broad-leaf forests, grassland ([[steppe]]), and semi-desert (fringing the [[Caspian Sea]]) as the changes in vegetation reflect the changes in climate. [[Siberia]] supports a similar sequence but is taiga. The country contains 23 [[World Heritage Site]]s<ref>{{cite web|last=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|title=Russian Federation|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/ru|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> and 40 UNESCO [[Biosphere reserve]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last=The World Network of Biosphere Reserves&nbsp;<U+2014> UNESCO|title=Russian Federation|url=http://www.unesco.org/mab/BRs/EurBRlist.shtml|accessdate=2007-12-26}}</ref>

===Topography===
The two widest separated points in Russia are about 8,000&nbsp;km (5,000&nbsp;mi) apart along a [[geodesic]] line. These points are: the boundary with Poland on a 60&nbsp;km long (40-mi long) [[Vistula Spit|spit of land]] separating the [[Gda<U+0144>sk Bay|Gulf of Gda<U+0144>sk]] from the [[Vistula Lagoon]]; and the farthest southeast of the [[Kuril Islands]], a few miles off [[Hokkaid<U+014D>|Hokkaid<U+014D> Island]], Japan. The points which are furthest separated in longitude are 6,600&nbsp;km (4,100&nbsp;mi) apart along a geodesic. These points are: in the West, the same spit; in the East, the [[Diomede Islands|Big Diomede Island]] (Ostrov Ratmanova). The Russian Federation spans 11 [[time zone]]s.

Most of Russia consists of vast stretches of plains that are predominantly [[steppe]] to the south and heavily forested to the north, with [[tundra]] along the northern coast. Mountain ranges are found along the southern borders, such as the [[Caucasus]] (containing [[Mount Elbrus]], Russia's and Europe's highest point at 5,642&nbsp;m&nbsp;/ 18,511&nbsp;ft) and the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]], and in the eastern parts, such as the [[Verkhoyansk Range]] or the volcanoes on [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]]. The [[Ural Mountains]] form a north-south range that divides Europe and Asia, rich in mineral resources. Russia possesses 10% of the world's [[arable land]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Oil prices drive the cost of food|publisher=RIA Novosti|url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20080222/99853566.html|accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref>

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of Russia}}
The climate of the Russian Federation formed under the influence of several determining factors. The enormous size of the country and the remoteness of many areas from the sea result in the dominance of the [[continental climate]], which is prevalent in European and Asian Russia except for the tundra and the extreme southeast.<ref name=climate/> Mountains in the south obstructing the flow of warm air masses from the Indian Ocean and the plain of the west and north makes the country open to Arctic and Atlantic influences.<ref name=congress>{{cite web|title=Climate|publisher=Library Of Congress|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/24.htm|accessdate=2007-12-26}}</ref>

Throughout much of the territory there are only two distinct seasons&nbsp;<U+2014> winter and summer; spring and autumn are usually brief periods of change between extremely low temperatures and extremely high.<ref name=congress/> The coldest month is January (on the shores of the sea<U+2014>February), the warmest usually is July. Great ranges of temperature are typical. In winter, temperatures get colder both from south to north and from west to east.<ref name=climate/> Summers can be quite hot and humid, even in Siberia.

In the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes, such as the [[Kipchaks]] and the [[Pechenegs]], caused a massive migration of Slavic populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north, particularly to the area known as [[Zalesye]].<ref name="Klyuch1">{{cite book|last=Klyuchevsky|first=Vasily|title=The course of the Russian history|location=v.1|url=http://www.kulichki.com/inkwell/text/special/history/kluch/kluch16.htm|isbn=5-244-00072-1}}</ref> Like many other parts of [[Eurasia]], these territories were [[Mongol invasion of Rus|overrun by the Mongols]].

The most powerful successor state to Kievan Rus' was [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]]. It would annex rivals such as [[Tver]] and [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]], and eventually become the basis of the modern Russian state. After the fall of [[Constantinople]] in 1453, Moscow [[Third Rome|claimed succession to the legacy]] of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. While still under the domain of the [[Timeline of the Tataro-Mongol Yoke in Russia|Mongol-Tatars]] and with their connivance, the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Duchy of Moscow]] (or "Muscovy") began to assert its influence in Western Russia in the early 14th century. Assisted by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and Saint [[Sergius of Radonezh]]'s spiritual revival, Russia inflicted a defeat on the Mongol-Tatars in the [[Battle of Kulikovo]] (1380). [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] (''Ivan the Great'') eventually threw off the control of the [[invasion|invaders]], consolidated surrounding areas under Moscow's dominion and was the first to take the title "grand duke of all the Russias".<ref>{{cite web|last=May|first=Dr. Timothy|title=Khanate of the Golden Horde|url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/history/keller/Mongols/states3.html|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref>

In 1547, [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]] (''Ivan the Terrible'') was officially crowned the first [[Tsar]] of Russia. During his long reign, Ivan IV annexed the [[Siege of Kazan (1552)|Tatar khanates]] ([[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]], [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]]) along the [[Volga River]] and transformed Russia into a multiethnic and multiconfessional state.

{{main|Russian Empire}}
[[Image:Peter der-Grosse 1838.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] officially proclaimed the existence of the [[Russian Empire]] in 1721]]

Under the [[House of Romanov|Romanov dynasty]] and [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] (''Peter the Great''), the Russian Empire became a world power. Ruling from 1682 to 1725, Peter defeated [[Sweden]] in the [[Great Northern War]], forcing it to cede West [[Karelia]] and [[Ingria]] (two regions lost by Russia in the [[Time of Troubles]]),<ref>{{cite book|last=Solovyov|first=Sergey|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|location=v.9, ch.1|url=http://militera.lib.ru/common/solovyev1/09_01.html|isbn=5170021429|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> [[Governorate of Estonia|Estland]], and [[Livonia|Livland]], securing Russia's access to the sea and sea trade.<ref>{{cite book|last=Solovyov|first=Sergey|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|location=v.15, ch.1|url=http://militera.lib.ru/common/solovyev1/15_01.html}}</ref> It was in Ingria that Peter founded a new capital, [[Saint Petersburg]]. Peter's reforms brought considerable Western European cultural influences to Russia. [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]] (''Catherine the Great''), who ruled from 1762 to 1796, continued the efforts to establish Russia as one of the [[Great Powers]] of Europe. In alliance with [[Prussia]] and [[Austria]], Russia stood against [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s [[France]] and eliminated its rival Poland-Lithuania in a series of [[Partitions of Poland|partitions]], gaining large areas of territory in the west. As a result of its victories in the [[Russo-Turkish War]], by the early 19th century Russia had made significant territorial gains in [[South Caucasus|Transcaucasia]]. [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] at the height of his power failed miserably as obstinate Russian resistance combined with the bitterly cold [[Russian winter]] dealt him a disastrous defeat, in which more than 95% of his invading force perished.<ref name=uslibrary>{{cite web|title=Ruling the Empire|publisher=Library of Congress|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/5.htm|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> The officers in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] brought ideas of [[liberalism]] back to Russia with them and even attempted to curtail the tsar's powers during the abortive [[Decembrist revolt]] of 1825, which was followed by several decades of political repression.

The prevalence of [[Russian serfdom|serfdom]] and the conservative policies of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicolas I]] impeded the development of Russia in the mid-nineteenth century. Nicholas's successor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] (1855<U+2013>1881) enacted significant reforms, including the [[Emancipation reform of 1861|abolition of serfdom]] in 1861; these "Great Reforms" spurred [[Industrialisation|industrialization]]. However, many socio-economic conflicts were aggravated during [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]<U+2019>s reign and under his son, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. Harsh conditions in factories created mass support for the revolutionary socialist movement. In January 1905, striking workers peaceably demonstrated for reforms in Saint Petersburg but were fired upon by troops, killing and wounding hundreds. The abject failure of the Tsar's military forces in the initially-popular [[Russo-Japanese War]], and the event known as "[[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]]", ignited the [[Russian Revolution (1905)|Russian Revolution of 1905]]. Although the uprising was swiftly put down by the army and although Nicholas II retained much of his power, he was forced to concede major reforms, including granting the freedoms of speech and assembly, the legalization of political parties and the creation of an elected legislative assembly, the [[Duma]]; however, the hopes for basic improvements in the lives of industrial workers were unfulfilled.

Russia entered [[World War I]] in aid of its ally [[Serbia]] and fought a war across three fronts while isolated from its allies. Russia did not want war but felt that the only alternative was German domination of Europe. Although the army was far from defeated in 1916, the already-existing public distrust of the regime was deepened by the rising costs of war, casualties (Russia suffered the highest number of [[World War I casualties#Casualties by country|both military and civilian deaths]] of the [[Entente Powers]]), and tales of corruption and even treason in high places, leading to the outbreak of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]]. A series of uprisings were organized by workers and peasants throughout the country, as well as by soldiers in the Russian army, who were mainly of peasant origin. Many of the uprisings were organized and led by democratically-elected councils called Soviets. The [[February Revolution]] overthrew the Russian monarchy, which was replaced by a shaky coalition of political parties that declared itself the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]]. The abdication marked the end of imperial rule in Russia, and Nicholas and his family were imprisoned and later executed during the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]]. While initially receiving the support of the Soviets, the Provisional Government proved unable to resolve many problems which had led to the February Revolution. The second revolution, the [[October Revolution]], led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], overthrew the Provisional Government and created the world<U+2019>s first Communist state.

===Soviet Russia===

[[Image:Lenin 1920.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vladimir Lenin]]]]
Following the [[October Revolution]], a [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] broke out between the new regime and the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionaries]], [[Menshevik]]s, and the [[White movement]]. The [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] concluded hostilities with the [[Central Powers]] in World War I. Russia lost its [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], [[Poland|Polish]] and [[Baltic governorates|Baltic]] territories, and [[Finland]] by signing the treaty. The [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]] launched a [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|military intervention]] in support of anti-Communist forces and both the Bolsheviks and White movement carried out campaigns of deportations and executions against each other, known respectively as the [[Red Terror]] and [[White Terror]]. By the end of the Civil War, some 20 million had died and the Russian economy and infrastructure were completely devastated. Following victory in the Civil War, the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] together with three other Soviet republics [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|formed]] the [[Soviet Union]] on 30 December 1922. The [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] dominated the Soviet Union for its entire 74-year history; the USSR was often referred to as "Russia" and its people as "Russians." The largest of the republics, Russia contributed over half the population of the Soviet Union. After Lenin's death in 1924, [[Joseph Stalin]] consolidated power and became [[dictator]]. Stalin launched a [[Planned economy|command economy]], rapid [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] of the largely rural country and [[Collectivization in the USSR|collectivization]] of its agriculture and the Soviet Union was transformed from an agrarian economy to a major industrial powerhouse in a short span of time.  This transformation came with a heavy price, however; millions of citizens died as a consequence of his harsh policies.

The [[Red Army]] occupied [[Eastern Europe]] after the war, including the [[East Germany|eastern half]] of Germany; Stalin installed communist governments in these [[satellite state]]s. Becoming the world's second [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons power]], the USSR established the [[Warsaw Pact]] alliance and entered into a struggle for global dominance with the United States, which became known as the [[Cold War]].

After Stalin's death, Russian leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] denounced Stalin and [[Khruschev thaw|eased his repressive policies]]. He began the process of eliminating the [[Stalinist]] political system known as [[de-Stalinization]] and abolished the [[Gulag]] labor camps, releasing millions of prisoners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916205-2,00.html|publisher=[[TIME]]|accessdate=2008-08-01|title=Great Escapes from the Gulag}}</ref> The Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial [[satellite]], [[Sputnik 1]] and the Russian [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first human being to orbit the [[Earth]] aboard the first manned spacecraft, [[Vostok 1]]. Tensions with the [[Russia-United States relations|United States]] heightened when the two rivals clashed over the deployment of the U.S. [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter missiles]] in [[Turkey]] and Soviet [[Cuban Missile Crisis|missiles in Cuba]]. Following the ousting of Khrushchev, another period of rule by collective leadership ensued until [[Leonid Brezhnev]] established himself in the early 1970s as the pre-eminent figure in Soviet politics. Brezhnev's rule oversaw [[economic stagnation]] and the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], which dragged on without success and with continuing casualties inflicted by [[Mujahideen|insurgents]]. Soviet citizens became increasingly discontented with the war, ultimately leading to the withdrawal of Soviet forces by 1989. From 1985 onwards, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced the policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) and ''[[perestroika]]'' (restructuring) in an attempt to modernize the country. The [[economy of the Soviet Union|USSR economy]] was the second largest in the world prior to the Soviet collapse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact90/world12.txt|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=2008-03-09|title=1990 CIA World Factbook}}</ref>

[[Image:Bely Dom Moscow 001.jpg|thumb|left|The [[White House, Moscow|White House]], the seat of the [[Russian Government]]]]

The federal government is composed of three branches:
* [[legislature|Legislative]]: The [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Federal Assembly of Russia|Federal Assembly]], made up of the [[State Duma]] and the [[Federation Council of Russia|Federation Council]] adopts [[federal law]], [[declaration of war|declares war]], approves treaties, has the [[power of the purse]], and has power of [[impeachment]], by which it can remove the President.
* [[Executive (government)|Executive]]: The [[President of Russia|president]] is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the military, can veto [[Bill (proposed law)|legislative bills]] before they become law, and appoints the Cabinet and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.
* [[Judiciary]]: The [[Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation|Constitutional Court]], [[Supreme Court of the Russian Federation|Supreme Court]], [[Supreme Court of Arbitration of the Russian Federation|Supreme Court of Arbitration]] and lower [[federal courts]], whose judges are appointed by the Federation Council on the recommendation of the president, interpret laws and can overturn laws they deem [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]].

According to the Constitution, constitutional justice in the court is based on the equality of all citizens,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Russian Federation|work=(Article 19, para. 1)|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-03.htm|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> judges are independent and subject only to the law,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Russian Federation|work=(Article 120, para. 1)|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-08.htm|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> trials are to be open and the accused is guaranteed a defense.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Russian Federation|work=(Article 123, para. 1)|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-08.htm|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> Since 1996, Russia has instituted a moratorium on the [[capital punishment in Russia|death penalty in Russia]], although capital punishment has not been abolished by law.

The president is elected by popular vote for a four-year term<ref>{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Russian Federation|work=(Article 81, para. 1)|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-05.htm|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> (eligible for a second term but constitutionally barred for a third consecutive term);<ref>{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Russian Federation|work=(Article 81, para. 3)|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-05.htm|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> election last held 2 March 2008. Ministries of the government are composed of the premier and his deputies, ministers, and selected other individuals; all are appointed by the president on the recommendation of the Prime Minister (whereas the appointment of the latter requires the consent of the State Duma).
The national legislature is the [[Federal Assembly of Russia|Federal Assembly]], which consists of two chambers; the 450-member [[State Duma]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Russian Federation|work=(Article 95, para. 3)|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-06.htm|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> and the 176-member [[Federation Council of Russia|Federation Council]]. Leading political parties in Russia include [[United Russia]], the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist Party]], the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]] and [[Fair Russia]].

==Subdivisions==
{{Main|Subdivisions of Russia}}

;Federal subjects
The Russian Federation comprises 83&nbsp;[[federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]].<ref name="Constitution">{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Russian Federation|work=(Article 65, para. 1) In 1993, when the Constitution was adopted, there were 89&nbsp;subjects listed. Some of them were later [[federal subjects of Russia#Mergers|merged]]|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-04.htm|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> These subjects have equal representation<U+2014>two delegates each<U+2014>in the [[Federation Council of Russia|Federation Council]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Russian Federation|work=(Article 95, para.2)|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-06.htm|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> However, they differ in the degree of autonomy they enjoy.
*46 [[oblasts of Russia|oblast]]s (provinces): most common type of federal subjects, with federally appointed governor and locally elected legislature.
*21 [[republics of Russia|republics]]: nominally autonomous; each has its own constitution, president, and parliament.  Republics are allowed to establish their own official language alongside Russian but are represented by the federal government in international affairs.  Republics are meant to be home to specific ethnic minorities.
*Nine [[krais of Russia|krai]]s (territories): essentially the same as oblasts. The "territory" designation is historic, originally given to frontier regions and later also to administrative divisions that comprised autonomous okrugs or autonomous oblasts.
*Four [[autonomous okrugs of Russia|autonomous okrug]]s (autonomous districts): originally autonomous entities within oblasts and krais created for ethnic minorities, their status was elevated to that of federal subjects in the 1990s.  With the exception of [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]], all autonomous okrugs are still administratively subordinated to a krai or an oblast of which they are a part.
*One [[autonomous oblasts of Russia|autonomous oblast]] (the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]]): originally autonomous oblasts were administrative units subordinated to krais.  In 1990, all of them except the Jewish AO were elevated in status to that of a republic.
*Two [[federal cities of Russia|federal cities]] ([[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg|St.&nbsp;Petersburg]]): major cities that function as separate regions.

Russia's large number of ethnic groups have distinctive traditions of [[folk music]]. Music in 19th century Russia was defined by the tension between classical composer [[Mikhail Glinka]] and [[The Five|his followers]], who embraced Russian national identity and added religious and folk elements to their compositions, and the [[Russian Musical Society]] led by composers [[Anton Rubinstein|Anton]] and [[Nikolai Grigoryevich Rubinstein|Nikolay Rubinstein]], which was musically conservative. The later Romantic tradition of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], one of the greatest composers of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]] whose music has come to be known and loved for its distinctly Russian character as well as its rich harmonies and stirring melodies, was brought into the 20th century by [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], one of the last great champions of the Romantic style of European classical music.

World-renowned composers of the 20th century included [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]], and [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]]. During most of the Soviet Era, music was highly scrutinized and kept within a conservative, accessible idiom in conformity with the Stalinist policy of socialist realism. Russian conservatories have turned out generations of world-renowned soloists. Among the best known are violinists [[David Oistrakh]] and [[Gidon Kremer]], cellist [[Mstislav Rostropovich]], pianists [[Vladimir Horowitz]], [[Sviatoslav Richter]] and [[Emil Gilels]], and vocalist [[Galina Vishnevskaya]].

===Literature===

[[Russian literature]] is considered to be among the most influential and developed in the world, contributing much of the world's most famous literary works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761564269/Russian_Literature.html|title=Russian Literature|last=Microsoft<U+00AE> Encarta<U+00AE> Online Encyclopedia 2007|accessdate=2008-01-07}}</ref> Russia's literary history dates back to the 10th century and by the early 19th century a native tradition had emerged, producing some of the greatest writers of all time. This period and the [[Golden Age of Russian Poetry]] began with [[Alexander Pushkin]], considered to be the founder of modern Russian literature and often described as the "Russian Shakespeare".<ref>{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Catriona|title=Russian Literature: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions) (Paperback)|publisher=Oxford Paperbacks|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Russian-Literature-Short-Introduction-Introductions/dp/0192801449|isbn=0192801449}}</ref> Amongst Russia's most renowned poets and writers of the 19th century are [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Mikhail Lermontov]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Nikolai Gogol]], [[Ivan Turgenev]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]].

[[Image:L.N.Tolstoy Prokudin-Gorsky.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leo Tolstoy]] (1828<U+2013>1910), writer]]
By the 1880s Russian literature had begun to change. The age of the great novelists was over and short fiction and poetry became the dominant genres of Russian literature for the next several decades which became known as the [[Silver Age of Russian Poetry]]. Previously dominated by realism, symbolism dominated Russian literature in the years between 1893 and 1914. Leading writers of this age include [[Valery Bryusov]], [[Andrei Bely]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Alexander Blok|Aleksandr Blok]], [[Nikolay Gumilev]],[[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]], [[Fyodor Sologub]], [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[Osip Mandelstam]], [[Marina Tsvetaeva]], [[Leonid Andreyev]], [[Ivan Bunin]] and [[Maxim Gorky]].

Following the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the ensuing civil war, Russian cultural life in was left in chaos. Some established writers left Russia while a new generation of talented writers who had at least some sympathy for the ideals of the revolution was emerging. The most ardent of these joined together in writers organizations with the aim of creating a new and distinctive proletarian (working-class) culture appropriate to the new state. Throughout the 1920s writers enjoyed broad tolerance. In the 1930s censorship over literature was tightened in line with Joseph Stalin's policy of [[socialist realism]]. After his death several thaws took place and restrictions on literature were eased. By the 1970s and 1980s, writers were increasingly ignoring the guidelines of socialist realism. The leading writers of the Soviet era included [[Yevgeny Zamyatin|Yevgeny Zamiatin]], [[Isaac Babel]], [[Ilf and Petrov]], [[Yury Olesha]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], [[Boris Pasternak]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Michail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov|Mikhail Sholokhov]], [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]] and [[Andrey Voznesensky]].

===Motion pictures===
{{main|Cinema of Russia}}
[[Image:Vgik.jpg|thumb|left|The world's oldest [[film school]], the [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography|Russian State Institute of Cinematography]]]]
While in the industrialized nations of the West, motion pictures had first been accepted as a form of cheap recreation and leisure for the working class, Russian filmmaking came to prominence following the 1917 revolution when it explored editing as the primary mode of cinematic expression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-52145/history-of-the-motion-picture|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica|title=History of the motion picture: The Soviet Union|accessdate=2008-01-07}}</ref> Russian and later Soviet cinema was a hotbed of invention in the period immediately following the 1917 revolution, resulting in world-renowned films such as ''[[The Battleship Potemkin|Battleship Potemkin]]''.<ref name=film>{{cite web|title=Russia::Motion pictures|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica|year=2007|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-38645|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> Soviet-era filmmakers, most notably [[Sergei Eisenstein]] and [[Andrei Tarkovsky]], would become some of the world's most innovative and influential directors.

Eisenstein also was a student of filmmaker and theorist [[Lev Kuleshov]], who formulated the groundbreaking editing process called [[Soviet montage theory|montage]] at the world's first film school, the [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography|All-Union Institute of Cinematography]] in Moscow. [[Dziga Vertov]], whose kino-glaz (<U+201C>film-eye<U+201D>) theory<U+2014>that the camera, like the human eye, is best used to explore real life<U+2014>had a huge impact on the development of documentary film making and cinema realism. In 1932, Stalin made [[socialist realism]] the state policy; this stifled creativity but many Soviet films in this style were artistically successful, including ''[[Chapaev (film)|Chapaev]]'', ''[[The Cranes Are Flying]]'' and ''[[Ballad of a Soldier]]''.<ref name=film/> [[Leonid Gaidai]]'s comedies of the 1960s and 1970s were immensely popular, with many of the catch phrases still in use today. In 1969, [[Vladimir Motyl]]'s ''[[White Sun of the Desert]]'' was released, starting a genre known as '[[ostern]]s'. The film is watched by [[Astronaut|cosmonauts]] before any trip into space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmlinc.com/wrt/onsale/russian08/whitesunofthedesert.html|publisher=Film Society of Lincoln Center|title=White Sun of the Desert / Beloe solntse pustyni|accessdate=2008-01-18}}</ref>

The 1980s and 1990s were a period of crisis in Russian cinema. Although Russian filmmakers became free to express themselves, state subsidies were drastically reduced, resulting in fewer films produced. The early years of the 21st century have brought increased viewership and subsequent prosperity to the industry on the back of the economy's rapid development, and production levels are already higher than in Britain and Germany.<ref name=kino>{{cite web|last=Dzieciolowski|first=Zygmunt|title=Kinoeye: Russia's reviving film industry|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-Film/russian_film_3726.jsp|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> Russia's total box-office revenue in 2007 was $565 million, up 37% from the previous year<ref>{{cite web|title=Russian Entertainment & Media Industry worth $27.9 bn by 2011|publisher=PricewaterhouseCoopers|url=http://www.pwc.com/extweb/ncpressrelease.nsf/docid/B373F0C74AA25A7480257309003B9833|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> (by comparison, in 1996 revenues stood at $6 million).<ref name=kino/> Russian cinema continues to receive international recognition.

===Visual arts===
{{main|Russian visual arts}}
Early Russian painting focused on [[icon painting]] and vibrant [[fresco]]s inherited by Russians from [[Byzantium]]. As [[Moscow]] rose to power, [[Theophanes the Greek]] and [[Andrei Rublev]] are vital names associated with the beginning of a distinctly Russian art. The [[Russian Academy of Arts]] was created in 1757, aimed to give Russian artists an international role and status. Notable portrait painters from the Academy include [[Ivan Argunov]], [[Fyodor Rokotov]], [[Dmitry Levitzky]] and [[Vladimir Borovikovsky]]. [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] flourished in the 19th century and the realists captured Russian identity. Russian landscapes of wide rivers, forests, and birch clearings, as well as vigorous genre scenes and robust portraits of their contemporaries asserted a sense of identity. Other artists focused on [[social criticism]], showing the conditions of the poor and caricaturing authority while [[critical realism]] flourished under the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]].

[[Image:Bernsteinzimmer02.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Amber Room]]]]
After the abolition of serfdom in 1861 some artists made the circle of human suffering their focus. Artists sometimes created wide canvasses to depict dramatic moments in Russian history. The [[Peredvizhniki]] (wanderers) group of artists broke with Russian Academy and initiated a school of art liberated from Academic restrictions. Their paintings had deep social and political meaning. Leading realists include [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]], [[Ivan Kramskoi]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Isaac Levitan]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], and [[Ilya Repin]]. By the 1830s the Academy was sending painters overseas to learn. The most gifted of these were [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov|Aleksander Ivanov]] and [[Karl Briullov]], both of whom were noted for the Romantic historical canvasses. Uniquely Russian styles of painting emerged by the late 19th century that was intimately engaged with the daily life of Russian society.

[[Image:Moscow Metro, Kievskaya station.jpg|thumb|left|The exquisite decoration of the [[Moscow Metro]]]]
The [[Russian avant-garde]] is an umbrella term used to define the large, influential wave of [[modernist art]] that flourished in Russia from approximately 1890 to 1930. The term covers many separate, but inextricably related, art movements that occurred at the time; namely [[neo-primitivism]], [[suprematism]], [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]], [[rayonism]] and [[Russian Futurism|futurism]]. Notable artists from this era include [[El Lissitzky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Vladimir Tatlin]], [[Alexander Rodchenko]], and [[Marc Chagall]] amongst others. The Russian avant-garde reached its creative and popular height in the period between the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and 1932, at which point the ideas of the [[avant-garde]] clashed with the newly emerged conservative Stalinist direction of [[socialist realism]].

By the late 1920s the rigid policy of socialist realism enveloped the visual arts as it did literature and motion pictures and soon the avant-garde had faded from sight. Some artists combined innovation with socialist realism including [[Ernst Neizvestny]], [[Ilya Kabakov]], [[Mikhail Shemyakin]], [[Erik Bulatov]] and [[Vera Mukhina]]. They employed techniques as varied as [[primitivism]], [[hyperrealism]], [[grotesque]], and [[abstraction]], but they shared a common distaste for the canons of socialist realism. Soviet artists produced works that were furiously patriotic and anti-fascist in the 1940s. Events and battles from the Great Patriotic War were depicted with stirring patriotism and after the war sculptors made many monuments to the war dead, the greatest of which have a great restrained solemnity. In the 20th century many Russian artists made their careers in Western Europe, due in part to the traumas of the Revolution. Russian artists such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Marc Chagall]], and [[Naum Gabo]] spread their work and ideas internationally. These Russian artists studied internationally in Paris and Munich and their involuntary exile spread the impact of Russian art globally.
