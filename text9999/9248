[[Image:Riverina NSW.png|thumb|350px|The Riverina region in relation to New South Wales.]] 
The '''Riverina''' is an agricultural [[List of regions in Australia|region]] of south-western [[New South Wales]] (NSW), [[Australia]].  The Riverina is distinguished from other Australian regions due to the combination of flat plains, warm to hot climate and an ample supply of water for [[irrigation]].  This combination has allowed the Riverina to develop into one of the most productive and agriculturally diverse areas of Australia.  Bordered on the south by the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and on the east by the [[Great Dividing Range]], the Riverina covers those areas of New South Wales in the [[Murray River|Murray]] and [[Murrumbidgee River|Murrumbidgee]] drainage zones to their confluence in the west.

Home to [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] groups for over 40,000 years, the Riverina was originally settled by [[European ethnic groups|European]]s in the mid-19th century as a [[grazing|pastoral]] region providing [[beef]] and [[wool]] to markets in Australia and beyond.  In the 20th century, the development of major irrigation areas in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys has led to the introduction of crops such as [[rice]] and [[List of grape varieties|wine grapes]]. The Riverina has strong cultural ties to Victoria, and the region was the source of much of the impetus behind the [[federation of Australia]]n colonies.

Major population and service centres in the Riverina include the cities of [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]], [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]] and [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]].  Albury and Wagga Wagga are home to campuses of [[Charles Sturt University]], the only local provider of [[higher education]] for the region.  Wagga Wagga is home to two major [[Australian Defence Force]] establishments.

==Geography==
The delineation of the Riverina region by government agencies and other bodies varies, but in common usage it generally comprises the agricultural and [[grazing|pastoral]] areas of New South Wales, west of the [[Great Dividing Range]] and in the [[drainage basin]] of the snow-fed [[Murray River|Murray]] and [[Murrumbidgee River]]s.<ref>[http://www.maps.com.au/PDFS/Maps/riverina/RiverinaReg.pdf Riverina Region Map (pdf)]</ref>   The northern boundary beyond the Riverina is determined by the [[Lachlan River]] catchment area and is referred to as the [[Central West, New South Wales|Central West]]. Along the Murray to the south, the Riverina borders the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].   West of the [[confluence (geography)|confluence]] of the Murray and Murrumbidgee is the beginning of the more arid [[Far West, New South Wales|Far West]] region.

In general, the Riverina is an [[alluvial]] [[plain]] formed by deposition carried from the [[Great Dividing Range]] by streams between 30,000 to 15,000 years ago.<ref name="Landform">{{cite web

}}</ref> The terrain includes rolling hills to the east but then becomes flatter to the west with most of that plain reaching less than 200 metres above sea level.  The western Riverina consists largely of featureless [[saltbush]] plain.

===Landform and hydrology===
 
The [[geology]] of the Riverina comprises several [[trough (geology)|trough]]s and [[sedimentary basin]]s. The western Riverina is presumed to be a continuation of the Ballarat and Bendigo geological zone while eastern sections are underlain by western portions of the Lachlan [[Fold (geology)|Fold]] Belt. There is potential for the Riverina to host several [[mineral]] deposit types including [[coal]], [[petroleum]], coal seam [[methane]], [[gypsum]], orogenic gold, [[Cobar, New South Wales|Cobar]] style [[polymetal|polymetallic]] systems, heavy [[mineral sands]] and possibly diamonds in these fold belt rocks and basins.<ref name="Landform"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://minerals.nsw.gov.au/geology/resource_geoscience?p=1366 | title = Riverina Western Regional Assessment | publisher = New South Wales Department of Primary Industries | accessdate = 2007-01-23}}</ref> Riverina soils are generally sandy along the river channels, with more [[soil salination|saline]] grey and brown clays found on rarely flooded areas on the perimeter of the floodplain.  As the Murrumbidgee passes downstream, the water and soil become more saline.<ref name="Landform"/>

The Riverina is drained by the large [[Murray-Darling Basin]].  Rivers and streams in the Riverina generally flow east to west.  As well as the Murray, Murrumbidgee and Lachlan, other streams include [[Billabong Creek]] and the [[Edward River]], an [[anabranch]] of the Murray.  Much of the water carried by these streams is diverted.  In 2001&ndash;2002, 52% of the Murray and Murrumbidgee water runoff was diverted, 77% of which was used for [[irrigation]].<ref name="CSIROirrigation">{{cite web

===Climate===
The [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]] classify the Riverina in the ''Hot Dry Zone (with cooler winters)'' climatic zone.  Places in this zone can be very hot in the summer months while in the winter, nights can be very cold.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/environ/travel/hotdrycool.shtml | title = Hot Dry Zone (with cooler winter) | publisher = [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)]] | accessdate = 2007-01-29}}</ref>   Mean daily maximum temperatures in the Riverina range from {{convert|31.0|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1}} in January and {{convert|12.4|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1}} in July in [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_074114.shtml | title = Climate Averages for Australian Sites - Averages for WAGGA WAGGA RESEARCH CENTRE | publisher = [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)]] | accessdate = 2007-01-29}}</ref> to {{convert|33.2|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1}} in January and {{convert|14.8|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1}} in July in [[Hillston, New South Wales|Hillston]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_075032.shtml | title = Climate Averages for Australian Sites - Averages for HILLSTON AIRPORT | publisher = [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)]] | accessdate = 2007-01-29}}</ref>

Rainfall levels in the Riverina are generally low with the median annual rainfall over most of the region between 250&ndash;500 millimetres (mm), rising to between 500&ndash;800 mm on the eastern fringe.  Rain generally falls in the winter in the northern Riverina and around Hay while in the south rainfall patterns are fairly consistent throughout the year.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/environ/other/seas_all.shtml | title = Seasonal rainfall zones of Australia | publisher = [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)]] | accessdate = 2007-01-29}}</ref>   [[Corowa, New South Wales|Corowa]], in the south eastern Riverina has an average rainfall of {{convert|539.4|mm|in|1}} per year<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_074034.shtml | title = Climate Averages for Australian Sites - Averages for COROWA AIRPORT | publisher = [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)]] | accessdate = 2007-01-29}}</ref> while mean annual rainfall at [[Hay, New South Wales|Hay]] is {{convert|367.2|mm|in|1}}.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_075031.shtml | title = Climate Averages for Australian Sites - Averages for HAY (MILLER STREET) | publisher = [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)]] | accessdate = 2007-01-29}}</ref>  [[Drought in Australia|Drought]] in 2006 has seen the lowest ever recorded rainfall in towns such as [[Lockhart, New South Wales|Lockhart]], [[Tarcutta, New South Wales|Tarcutta]] and [[Narrandera, New South Wales|Narrandera]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/annual/nsw/summary.shtml#records221 | title = New South Wales in 2006:El Ni<U+00F1>o brings an exceptionally hot and very dry year | publisher = [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)]] | accessdate = 2007-01-29}}</ref>

=== Riverina bioregion ===
{{FixBunching|mid}}
[[Image:Riverina bioregion.png|thumb|250px|left|The Riverina bioregion.  The Riverina bioregion covers much of the area commonly known as the Riverina but also takes in area as far south as Bendigo and as far north as Ivanhoe.]]
The [[National Parks and Wildlife Service (New South Wales)|New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service]] has divided New South Wales into 17 distinct bioregions.  Bioregions are quite large areas of land that capture a geophysical pattern which is linked to fauna and flora [[ecosystem]]s. The Riverina [[bioregion]] is an area of land that comprises part of the larger Riverina area but also extends into Victoria.  It has been defined by the New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service as extending from [[Ivanhoe, New South Wales|Ivanhoe]] in the Murray Darling Depression Bioregion south to [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]], and from [[Narrandera, New South Wales|Narrandera]] in the east to [[Balranald, New South Wales|Balranald]] in the west. 74.03% of the bioregion is in New South Wales, the remainder in Victoria. <ref name="NSWPWSRiverinaBioregion">{{cite web | url = http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/npws.nsf/Content/Riverina+Bioregion | title = Riverina bioregion | work = Bioregions of NSW | publisher = [[National Parks and Wildlife Service (New South Wales)|National Parks and Wildlife Service]] | accessdate = 2007-01-25}}</ref>

River channels in the region support River Red Gum (''[[Eucalyptus camaldulensis]]'') and River Cooba (''[[Acacia stenophylla]]'') communities.  Nearby higher areas contain Black Box (''[[Eucalyptus largiflorens]]'') woodlands and  a salt-tolerant grass, saltbush and daisy understorey.  Yellow Box (''[[Eucalyptus melliodora]]'') and Grey Box (''[[Eucalyptus microcarpa]]'') occur along with Cypress Pine (''[[Callitris glaucophylla]]'') on areas rarely subjected to flooding.  The area away from the rivers often consists of treeless plains, consisting of various saltbush (''[[Atriplex]]'') species, Cotton Bush (''[[Maireana aphylla]]'') and varieties of ''[[Danthonia]]'' and ''[[Austrostipa]]'' native grasslands.<ref name="NSWPWSRiverinaBiodiversity">{{cite web | url = http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/npws.nsf/Content/Riverina+-+biodiversity | title = Riverina - Biodiversity | work= Bioregions of NSW

Significant mammals endemic to forests in the bioregion include various species of glider, such as Sugar Gliders (''[[Petaurus breviceps]]''), Feathertail Gliders (''[[Acrobates pygmaeus]]'') and Squirrel Gliders (''[[Petaurus norfolcensis]]'') as well as Koalas (''[[Phascolarctos cinereus]]'')  A wide variety of birdlife makes its home in wetlands in the Riverina, including many [[Bird migration|migratory]] species.  Competition from introduced species and the effect of clearing, grazing and pasture improvement has led to a decline in the diversity of native flora and fauna in the area.<ref name="NSWPWSRiverinaBiodiversity"/>

[[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] people are thought to have inhabited the Riverina for at least 40,000 years.<ref name="NSWPWSRiverinaBioregionHistory">{{cite web | url = http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/npws.nsf/Content/Riverina+-+regional+history | title = Riverina - regional history | work = Riverina bioregion | publisher = [[National Parks and Wildlife Service (New South Wales)|National Parks and Wildlife Service]] | accessdate = 2007-01-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  | last =  Eardley | first =  Karen | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | year = 1999 | url = http://nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/PDFs/sbs_Riv_stage1.pdf  | title = A Foundation for Conservation in the Riverina Bioregion | format = pdf (154 pages) | work =  | publisher = NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service | accessdate = 2007-11-07}}  Note Eardley in turn relies on Hope, J.

The rivers played a leading role in the lifestyle of the Aboriginal people, acting as a source of food and a means of communication and trade.  [[Murray cod]] and shellfish were gathered for food and bark canoes were used for travel along the rivers.  Scars on many trees alongside the rivers are evidence of this extensive use of canoes.  In the summer it is likely that the Bangerang and Wiradjuri joined the Monaro groups in the [[Bogong moth]] feasts in the alpine country to the east<ref name="NSWPWSRiverinaBioregionHistory"/>  

===Exploration and pastoral settlement===
[[Image:CharlesSturt.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Charles Sturt]], the first European to follow the Murrumbidgee River downstream to the Murray.]]
The first European explorer in the Riverina was [[John Oxley]] in [[1817 in Australia|1817]] following the [[Lachlan River]] to what is now the town of [[Booligal, New South Wales|Booligal]].<ref name="NSWPWSRiverinaBioregionHistory"/>  Oxley was followed by [[Charles Sturt]], who followed the Murrumbidgee downstream to [[Lake Alexandrina (South Australia)|Lake Alexandrina]] in [[South Australia]] between [[1828 in Australia|1828]]&ndash;[[1831 in Australia|1831]]<ref>{{cite web | last = Sturt | first = Charles | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 2004  | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4330/4330-h/4330-h.htm | title = Two Expeditions into the Interior of Southern Australia | publisher = Project Gutenberg | accessdate = 2007-02-01}}</ref> and Major [[Thomas Mitchell]] in [[1836 in Australia|1836]] on his way to the [[Wimmera]] and the [[Western District]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Mitchell | first = Thomas | year = 2004 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12928/12928-h/12928-h.htm | title = Three Expeditions into the Interior of

Pastoral settlement followed soon after, with grazing runs established along the Murray and Murrumbidgee as far west as Hay by [[1839 in Australia|1839]]. At the time, the area was known as the [[Murrumbidgee District]].  [[Moulamein, New South Wales|Moulamein]], in the western Riverina, appears to make legitimate claims as the oldest town in the Riverina,<ref>[http://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/name_search/extract?id=MnjLjzUlMa Geographical Names Board of NSW]</ref> and indeed to being older than [[Melbourne]].<ref name="WakoolShire">{{cite web  | year = 2006 | url = http://www.wakool.local-e.nsw.gov.au/tourism/43802/43804.html | title = Old Court House Moulamein | work = History and Local Attractions | publisher = [[Council of the Shire of Wakool]] | accessdate = 2007-01-30}}</ref> The settlers often came into conflict with the indigenous inhabitants.

[[Cattle]] raising was the major industry in the 1840s with sheep becoming predominant in the 1860s.<ref name="NSWPWSRiverinaBioregionHistory"/>  At this time  many Victorians settled in the Riverina to breed sheep and cattle to feed the miners taking part in the [[Victorian Gold Rush]].  The herds were considered inferior at first, but these pastures were good for stock, and the land which seemed a desert was actually good fattening country.<ref name="RWGG">{{cite web | url = http://www.wgmb.net.au/index.php?id=22 | title = Riverina History & Data | publisher = Riverina Wine Grape Growers | accessdate = 2007-01-16}}</ref>
In the 1860s and 1870s, German settlers from the [[Barossa Valley]] travelled upstream to settle in the eastern Riverina. Because of their religious distinctiveness as [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]s, they preferred to form clustered [[German settlements in the Riverina|German settlements]].<ref>[[Dirk_HR_Spennemann|Spennemann, Dirk H.R.]] (2007) Mapping the German Footprint in the Riverina in 1884.

The name "Riverine", coined from the [[Entre R<U+00ED>os Province]] (between two rivers) in Argentina, South America, was in use as early as [[1857 in Australia|1857]]: a long letter under the caption "Riverine Colony" appeared in the Albury ''Border Post''  of January 24 that year.<ref name="RWGG"/> The name was coined by [[John Dunmore Lang|Dunmore Lang]] who translated it from the Spanish.<!--still don't know why or what the connection is--><ref name="brownpdf">{{cite web | last = Brown | first = A.J. | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 2005 | url = http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/pops/pop44/brown.pdf | title = The Constitution We Were Meant To Have: Re-examining the origins and strength of Australia<U+2019>s unitary political traditions | format = pdf | work = Department of the Senate Occasional Lecture Series | publisher = [[Australian Senate]] | accessdate = 2007-01-29}}</ref>

Dunmore Lang was also involved with the short lived Riverina [[secession]] movement which was active in the 1860s.  The movement was inspired by the success of the Victorian and Queensland secession movements and motivated by a desire to draw more public funds to the region and maintain the favourable land tenure the "[[squatting (pastoral)|squatter]]" pastoralists enjoyed. With the movement strongest in [[Deniliquin, New South Wales|Deniliquin]] and [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]], Dunmore Lang, unrelated squatter and parliamentarian [[Gideon Lang]] and other influential pastoralists joined with local newspaper editors, George Mott and David Jones in the campaign.<ref name="APIReview">{{cite web | last = Hogg | first = Robert | year = 2004 | url = http://www.api-network.com/cgi-bin/reviews/jrbview.cgi?n=1740970233&issue=44 | title = API Review of Books | work = Review:Leighton Frappell, Lords of the Saltbush Plains: Frontier Squatters and the Pastoral Independence Movement 1865-1866 | publisher = Australian Public Intellectual Network | accessdate = 2007-02-02

From Melbourne, [[broad gauge]] railway lines opened to [[Deniliquin, New South Wales|Deniliquin]] in 1876 and west to [[Moulamein, New South Wales|Moulamein]] and [[Balranald, New South Wales|Balranald]] in 1926.<ref name="Victorian Rail"/>  The Moulamein<U+2013>Balranald section closed in the 1980s.  The [[Albury-Wodonga railway line, Victoria|main northeast line]] reached [[Wodonga, Victoria|Wodonga]] in 1873, and was connected to Albury at a [[break-of-gauge]] in 1883.  The [[Shepparton railway line, Victoria|Melbourne-Shepparton railway line]] was extended to [[Tocumwal, New South Wales|Tocumwal]] in 1908 and the Melbourne<U+2013>[[Yarrawonga, Victoria|Yarrawonga]] line was extended to [[Oaklands, New South Wales|Oaklands]] in 1938, both lines meeting standard gauge lines that were subsequently closed.  [[Victorian Railways]] commenced construction of a railway from [[Robinvale, Victoria|Robinvale]] to Koorakee and Lette in New South Wales in 1924, but this railway was never completed. The Murray River bridge between Robinvale and [[Euston, New South Wales|Euston]] was instead converted to a road bridge, which will be demolished  when the new road bridge currently under construction is completed.  A branch line was built from Kerang to [[Murrabit, Victoria|Murrabit]] in 1924 and [[Stony Crossing, New South Wales|Stony Crossing]] (originally called Poonboon) in 1928 under an agreement with New South Wales.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/bra1922177/sch1.html | title=Border Railways Act 1922| publisher=[http://www.austlii.edu.au Australian Australasian Legal Information Institute] | accessdate=2006-06-09}}</ref>   No passenger services were carried on the section beyond Murrabit after 1932 and it was closed about 1943.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aattc.org.au/Times%20December%202002A.pdf | title=Poonboon| publisher=[http://www.aattc.org.au Australian Association of Time Table Collectors] | accessdate=2006-06-09}}</ref>

===Bushrangers===
Transport links assisted the development of the Riverina economy, at the same time areas of the region found themselves under threat from robbery and murder by various [[bushranger]]s. Between 1862 and 1865, the eastern Riverina between Wagga Wagga and Albury saw the depredations of [[Dan Morgan (bushranger)|Dan "Mad Dog" Morgan]].   Having previously been convicted of armed robbery, Morgan came to the attention to authorities in the Riverina when he bailed up a police magistrate, Henry Baylis, near [[Urana, New South Wales|Urana]] in 1863.  In 1864, Morgan bailed up Round Hill [[sheep station|station]], a large sheep farm near [[Morven, New South Wales|Morven]], killing a station hand.  Later that year, the bushranger shot dead a policeman in cold blood near [[Tumbarumba, New South Wales|Tumbarumba]].  The reward placed on his head reached <U+00A3>1,000 before, in April 1865, he was shot dead near [[Wangaratta, Victoria]].<ref name="ADBMorgan">{{cite web |last = McQuilton |first = John | url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/AS10351b.htm | title =  Morgan, Daniel (Dan) (c. 1830 - 1865) | work = Australian Dictionary of Biography | publisher = [[Australian National University]]  | accessdate = 2007-02-04}}</ref>

{{wikisourcepar|The Jerilderie Letter}}
The infamous Australian bushranger, [[Ned Kelly]], made possibly his most daring raid in the Riverina, at [[Jerilderie, New South Wales|Jerilderie]] in 1879.  After riding overland from north east Victoria, Kelly and his gang in a brazen move captured two local policemen and stole their uniforms.  Impersonating the police, they then proceeded to rob the [[Bank of New South Wales]] and hold the town captive for several days.  While in Jerilderie, he sought to have his manifesto published, the famous Jerilderie letter, a rambling 8,000 word condemnation of the colonial administration in Victoria and specifically the treatment of the [[Irish Australian|Irish]]. Being unable to find the local newspaper editor, he left the letter with a member of the bank staff and returned to Victoria <U+00A3>2,000 richer.<ref name="CrimeLibraryKelly?">{{cite web | url = http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/outlaws/ned_kelly/13.html | title = Ned Kelly - Jerilderie | work = Crime Library | publisher = Courtroom Television Network LLC | accessdate = 2007-02-05}}</ref>

=== Riverina and Federation ===
{{main|Federation of Australia}}
[[Image:BerriganFederalHotel.jpg|thumb|250px|The Federal Hotel in [[Berrigan, New South Wales|Berrigan]], one of a series of [[Public House|hotels]] built or renamed in the southern Riverina as a result of the Federation campaign]]
The close geographic and cultural ties between the Riverina and northern Victoria, combined with continuing frustration with inter colonial tariffs, made the Riverina a fertile area for ideas for uniting the various colonies in an [[Federation of Australia|Australian federation]].  This would see the southern Riverina in particular take a leading role in bringing about federation.

Prior to federation, the various Australian colonies could, and often did, charge [[tariff]]s on goods from the other colonies, ostensibly for the [[Protectionism|protection]] of their domestic manufacturing industries, mainly based in the larger cities such as Sydney and Melbourne.  For a border community such as the southern Riverina, these tariffs were a sore burden, making goods purchased from Melbourne, the closest large city, more expensive and reducing the competitiveness of these towns supplying the Melbourne and Adelaide markets.<ref name="AustralianUnity">{{cite web | url = http://www.australianunity.com.au/au/cofederation/aurole.asp | title = Federation: An ANA Perspective | publisher = [[Australian Unity]] | accessdate = 2007-02-05}}</ref>  In addition, crossing the border on the Murray River was a tiresome experience as each border crossing  had customs posts inspecting goods and luggage to ensure all duty was paid and to reduce smuggling, a popular activity.<ref name="TreasurerSpeech">{{cite web | last = Costello | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Costello | year = 2001 | url = http://www.treasurer.gov.au/tsr/content/speeches/2001/004.asp?pf=1 | title = Speech - Oddfellows Hall, Corowa. Saturday, [[28 July]] [[2001]] | publisher = Commonwealth of Australia | accessdate = 2007-02-05}}</ref>   Another item of concern was the lack of adequate river crossings.  Along the Riverina, the Murray was, and remains, part of New South Wales, who had no interest in assisting border residents to access goods and services in Victoria that may otherwise have been sourced from Sydney. 

In the early 1890s, for mainly patriotic reasons, the [[Australian Natives Association]] helped establish the  Federation League, a society dedicated to the creation of a federal nation.<ref name="AustralianUnity"/>  Following a series of addresses by the future [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], [[Edmund Barton]] to large crowds, some 15 League branches were established in the towns along the southern border.<ref name="TreasurerSpeech"/><ref name="NAABarton">{{cite web | url = http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/meetpm.asp?pmId=2&pageName=before | title = Edmund Barton | work =  Australia's Prime Ministers | publisher = National Archives of Australia | accessdate = 2007-02-05}}</ref> One of these towns, [[Corowa]], was the location for the first conference of the Australian Federation League in 1893.  At this conference, [[John Quick (politician)|Dr John Quick]], a delegate from Bendigo, proposed a resolution calling for the colonial legislatures to pass an act providing for the election of representatives to a convention to develop a federal [[constitution]]. This has been seen as the turning point in the push for Federation. The momentum generated from this point lead to a series of conventions and elections and finally, the inauguration of a federal constitution on [[1 January]] [[1901]].<ref name="AustralianUnity"/>

===Irrigation and closer settlement===
[[Image:Riverina 1916.jpg|250px|thumb|A 1916 map of the Riverina. The area where Griffith and Leeton would later be built was largely uninhabited until the development of the [[Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area]].]]
Large scale irrigation commenced with the establishment of the [[Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area]] (MIA) in [[1912 in Australia|1912]] which diverted water from the Murrumbidgee River near Narrandera. The River Murray Waters Agreement of [[1915 in Australia|1915]] allowed 26 [[weir]]s to be constructed with locks to provide permanent riverboat access to Echuca.  When riverboat transport was no longer significant, the weirs supported irrigation.  Irrigation in the region continued to develop with the construction of the [[Hume Dam]] between [[1919 in Australia|1919]] and [[1931 in Australia|1931]], the [[Burrinjuck Dam]] built in [[1928 in Australia|1928]] and [[Blowering Dam]] built in [[1968 in Australia|1968]].<ref name = "NSWPWSRiverinaBioregionHistory"/>

Development and promotion of the MIA led to large scale settlement on land described by Oxley 100 years earlier as "country which, for barrenness and desolation, can I think, have no equal." Settlers came from a diverse range of backgrounds and nationalities.  In particular, the [[Italian Australian|Italian]] community prospered in the Area, owning nearly half of all the farms around Griffith by 1954.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>
Later, further irrigation was developed for areas in the Murray valley starting with the Wakool Irrigation District in 1932, then the Deniboota and Denimein Irrigation Districts in 1938, the Berriquin Irrigation District in 1939 and the Tullakool Irrigation Area in 1942.  The Coleambally Irrigation Area, established in 1968, was the last of the major government-sponsored irrigation developments in New South Wales.<ref name="CSIROirrigation"/>

== Agriculture ==
[[Image:EubertaCentrePivotIrrigation.jpg|left|thumb|A [[center pivot irrigation|Centre pivot irrigation]] system near [[Euberta, New South Wales|Euberta]].  Much of the agricultural industry in the Riverina relies on irrigation.]]  
The high soil fertility and abundance of water in the Riverina floodplain has made the Riverina region one of the most productive farming regions in Australia with rice, wheat, [[maize]], [[canola]], [[citrus]] and [[List of grape varieties|wine grapes]] being grown in the area.  The Riverina contains many irrigation schemes including the [[Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area]]. 182,000 hectares are under irrigation in the region.<ref name="NSWDSRD">{{cite web | year =  | url = http://www.business.nsw.gov.au/region/profiles/riverina.htm | title = Riverina - food basket of Australia | work = Regions of NSW | publisher = [[New South Wales Department of State and Regional Development]] | accessdate = 2007-01-29}}</ref>

For the first few decades following the 1830s, European pastoral activity focused in the main on cattle production but by the 1860s sheep were the predominant stock.<ref name= "NSWPWSRiverinaBioregionHistory"/>

At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the region's agricultural and horticultural production was worth more than [[Australian dollar|AUD]] 1 billion. The region produces:
* over 25% of the state's fruit and vegetables
* 90% of NSW citrus products
* 80% of NSW wine/grape production
* livestock feedlots, sales and processing facilities
* nearly 20% of all NSW crop production and two thirds of its total value.<ref name="NSWDSRD"/>

In 1991-92 sheep and lamb numbers in the region were close to 7 million and there were 500,000 meat cattle.<ref name = "RWGG"/><!-- be good if we had some more recent numbers and some older neumbers for comparison-->
===Wool===
Much of the [[dryland farming|dryland]] areas of the Riverina contain large [[sheep station]]s, producing [[wool classing|medium class wool]].  The [[Peppin Merino]] sheep was first bred in the area around [[Wanganella, New South Wales|Wanganella]].  As many as 70 percent of today<U+2019>s Australian Merinos are said to be directly descended from the Peppin-developed sheep.<ref>[http://www.woolinnovation.com.au/Education/Student_information/Sheep_breeds_in_Australia/page__2158.aspx Australian Wool Innovation] - Sheep breeds in Australia.

===Rice===
The Riverina produces the vast majority of rice grown in Australia, particularly in the [[Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area]] (MIA), but also around the [[Finley, New South Wales|Finley]], [[Coleambally, New South Wales|Coleambally]] and [[Deniliquin, New South Wales|Deniliquin]] areas.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sunrice.com.au/rice/industry-grown.asp | title = The Australian Rice Growing Region | publisher = SunRice | accessdate = 2007-01-28}}</ref> The first commercial rice crops in the Riverina were grown in the Leeton and Yanco district in 1924, expanding to [[Wakool, New South Wales|Wakool]] during [[World War II]], the Denimein and Deniboota Irrigation Areas in the 1950s and Coleambally and Finley in the 1960s.   In recent years, rice is also grown in the Hay, [[Carrathool, New South Wales|Carrathool]] and [[Hillston, New South Wales|Hillston]] areas.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.aboutrice.com/handout01.htm | title = Information sheet: History of rice in Australia | publisher = Ricegrowers Association of Australia Inc. | accessdate = 2007-01-28}}</ref> 

Today, more than one million tonnes of Australian rice is produced each year and exported to over 70 countries, generating [[Australian dollar|$ AUD]] 500 million in export income and supporting 63 towns in the Riverina and northern Victoria.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rga.org.au/rice/facts.asp | title = Rice Facts | publisher = Ricegrowers Association of Australia Inc. | accessdate = 2007-01-28}}</ref> The headquarters of Ricegrowers Limited, who trade under the ''SunRice'' name,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sunrice.com.au/about/index.asp | title = About SunRice | publisher = Ricegrowers Ltd | accessdate = 2007-01-29}}</ref> is located in Leeton, Australia's rice capital.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sunrice.com.au/contact/addresses.asp | title = SunRice Address Book | publisher = Ricegrowers Ltd | accessdate = 2007-01-29}}</ref> Major rice mills are located in Leeton, Coleambally and the largest rice mill in the southern hemisphere in Deniliquin.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sunrice.com.au/careers/deniliquin.asp | title = SunRice Deniliquin | publisher = Ricegrowers Ltd | accessdate = 2007-01-28}}</ref>

===Wine===
[[Image:Vineyard - Riverina (1).jpg|thumb|right|A Riverina vineyard situated in [[Tumblong, New South Wales|Tumblong]]]]
The Riverina region is one of the most prosperous grape growing regions in Australia, (particularly in Griffith) along with the [[Barossa Valley]] in [[South Australia]]. The region grows 55% of varietal grapes in New South Wales and 15% of the total grape production within Australia and 80% of wine/grape production of New South Wales; the region is Australia's largest producer of wine.<!--seems to conflict with the 15% statement - need to reconcile - Aust largest comes from DSRD-->  Over 50% of the Riverina's wine production is exported. As a producer of specialist wine grapes, its wine style of international importance is [[Noble rot|Botrytised]] [[Semillon]] and the outstanding speciality, made from these grapes is a [[Sauternes]] style dessert wine.<ref name="NSWDSRD"/><ref>{{cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://www.wineaustralia.com/Australia/Default.aspx?tabid=713 | title = Riverina, New South Wales | work = Wine Regions | publisher = [[Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation]] | accessdate = 2007-01-15}}</ref>  

Irrigation made the growing of grapes for wine possible.  The first grapes were planted at [[Hanwood, New South Wales|Hanwood]] in the spring of [[1913 in Australia|1913]] by John James McWilliam and his eldest son Jack who had come to the district from their winery in Junee. Irrigation was by carting of water until the irrigation channels were opened a few months later. The first grapes were picked in 1916 and sent to Junee for processing. [[Penfolds]] established their winery in the region in [[1919 in Australia|1919]].<ref name = "RWGG"/>

==Cities, towns and settlements==
At the 2001 [[census in Australia|census]], the population of the Murray-Murrumbidgee (Statistical Region Sector), consisting almost entirely of the Riverina, was 255,881, 2.9% of whom are indigenous and 7.4% born outside Australia.  Other than the United Kingdom and Ireland, the largest ethnic groups in the Riverina were [[Italian Australians|Italian]]s and [[German Australian|German]]s.<ref name="MurrayMurrumbidgeeABSStats">{{Census 2001 AUS|id=19961|name=Murray-Murrumbidgee (Statistical Region Sector)|accessdate = 2007-06-29}}  The Murray-Murrumbidgee (Statistical Region Sector) also includes Wentworth Shire, outside the Riverina as described in this article and doesn't include some small towns in Bland Shire, included in this article.  The effect of removing Wentworth and adding the small towns is negligible.  A list detailing the make up of the ABS Statistical Regions can be found [http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs%40.nsf/66f306f503e529a5ca25697e0017661f/C690788B64B62C7ACA256AD4007F684B?opendocument here].</ref> 

The Riverina includes three cities; [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]], [[Albury-Wodonga|Albury]] and [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]].  Other large towns include [[Leeton, New South Wales|Leeton]],  [[Deniliquin, New South Wales|Deniliquin]], [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]], [[Narrandera, New South Wales|Narrandera]], [[Junee, New South Wales|Junee]], and [[Hay, New South Wales|Hay]].

Wagga Wagga is the largest inland city in New South Wales<ref>As at the 2001 census, Wagga Wagga is the 28th in the [[List of cities in Australia by population#50 largest Urban Centres by population|50 largest Urban Centres by population]] as per Australian Bureau of Statistics, ''2016.0 - Census of Population and Housing: Selected Characteristics for Urban Centres, Australia, 2001''. [http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/2016.02001?OpenDocument Web access]. Although Albury-Wodonga has a larger population, it of course includes the Victorian city of Wodonga. The population of Albury in 2001 was 42,438 which is less than Wagga's figure of 44,272. There are no other inland NSW cities ranked higher on the list.</ref> and serves as an important employment, educational, cultural, social and entertainment centre for surrounding towns throughout the Riverina. Wagga Wagga's facilities are of metropolitan standards with shopping, cafes, recreational facilities and nightlife present within the city. 

Albury offers similar facilities to Wagga Wagga to the far south of New South Wales and northern Victoria. The three largest centres in population in the region after Wagga Wagga and Albury are [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]], [[Leeton, New South Wales|Leeton]] and [[Deniliquin, New South Wales|Deniliquin]] and they provide advanced services to the outlying farming regions.

Parts of the Riverina experienced substantial population growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s;  in the five year period between 1996 and 2001, Griffith's population increased by 10.8%.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rrdb.com.au/rivprofile/griffith.htm | title = Griffith Regional Profile | publisher = Riverina Regional Development Board | accessdate = 2007-01-23}}</ref> Until recently Wagga Wagga's population was declining slowly and aging with strong growth in age groups 40 and over.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rrdb.com.au/rivprofile/waggawagga.htm | title = Wagga Wagga Regional Profile | publisher = Riverina Regional Development Board | accessdate = 2007-01-23}}</ref>  This has now changed and Wagga Wagga has become one of Australia's leading examples of the "sponge" city phenomenon, attracting residents from smaller towns in the Riverina such as [[Urana, New South Wales|Urana]].  In the year ended [[2006-06-30]], the population of Wagga Wagga grew by 1.3%, driven by its role as the regional centre for the Riverina and its hosting of a campus of [[Charles Sturt University]] and [[Australian Defence Force]] bases.<ref name="WaggaDailyAdvertiser">{{cite news

==Sports==
The Riverina is well known for the quality and range of its sports activity and many famous sportsmen and women have hailed from the Riverina.  These  include tennis champions [[Margaret Court]] and [[Evonne Goolagong]]; [[cricket]]ers [[Mark Taylor (cricketer)|Mark Taylor]], [[Geoff Lawson]] and [[Michael Slater]]; [[Rugby League]] players [[Peter Sterling]] and [[Laurie Daley]]; [[Australian rules football]]ers [[Haydn Bunton Senior]], [[Paul Kelly (footballer)|Paul Kelly]] and [[Wayne Carey]]; and jockeys [[Scobie Breasley|Arthur "Scobie" Breasley]] and [[Roy Higgins]].

The "Wagga Effect" is a term that has been used frequently in the Australian media to describe the disproportionately large number of elite sportsmen and women that originate from the town.<ref>{{cite news  | first=Edwina| last=Farley| url=http://www.abc.net.au/rural/nt/content/2005/s1504753.htm  | title=Sports stars more likely to come from the bush  | work=ABC Rural  | publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation    | date=[[2005-11-11]]  | accessdate=2007-01-20}}</ref> It is speculated that the phenomenon may arise in rural areas where the population is large enough to sustain the presence of a large number of sporting codes, but small enough to ensure that talented individuals are exposed to adult-level competition at an earlier age.

The Riverina was the setting for some of Australia's great artistic and literary works of the 19th and early 20th century.  Most of these works reflected the rural lifestyle and agricultural pursuits common in the Riverina at that time and projected an image of Australia and Australians that would later change rapidly.

The writer [[Joseph Furphy]] worked as a [[bullocky]] for 10 years in the area around [[Hay, New South Wales|Hay]] from 1872.<ref name="ADBFurphy">{{cite web  | last = Clark | first = Manning | authorlink = Manning Clark | url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080618b.htm | title =  Furphy, Joseph (Tom Collins) (1843 - 1912) | work = Australian Dictionary of Biography. Online Edition | publisher = [[Australian National University]] | accessdate = 2007-02-06}}</ref>  Later, using the [[pen name]] Tom Collins, Furphy wrote ''Such is Life''  set in the Riverina during the [[drought]] and depression of the 1890s and drawing on his experiences as a bullocky.  Although a slow seller, the novel was described as "fitted to become an Australian classic" by A.G. Stephens, the literary critic of [[The Bulletin]].<ref name="FurphyAge">{{cite news  | first = McGirr | last = Michael | title = Celebrating the original larrikin | url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/07/24/1058853193613.html | publisher = The Age | date = 2003-07-26 | accessdate = 2007-02-06}}</ref>

Published in 1921, ''Around the Boree Log and Other Verses'' was written by [[Patrick Joseph Hartigan]], under the pen name John O'Brien.  A [[Roman Catholic]] priest, after early stints at [[Thurgoona, New South Wales|Thurgoona]] and [[Berrigan, New South Wales|Berrigan]], in 1917 Hartigan was appointed as the parish priest of [[Narrandera, New South Wales|Narrandera]] where he stayed until 1944.  His poems recorded the everyday lives and mateship of the people of the Riverina.  His friend and well known poet [[C. J. Dennis]] hailed them in [[the Bulletin]] as in 'the direct [[Henry Lawson|Lawson]]-[[Banjo Paterson|Paterson]] line mainly<U+2014>unaffected talk about Australians, much as they would naturally talk about themselves'.  ''Around the Boree Log'' ran to five editions and 18,000 copies by 1926.<ref name="HartiganADB">{{cite web | last = Walsh | first = G.P. | year = 1983

The artist and key member of the [[Heidelberg School]], [[Tom Roberts]] spent some time on a [[sheep station]] near [[Brocklesby, New South Wales|Brocklesby]] prior to and during the painting of his most celebrated artwork, ''Shearing the Rams''.<ref name="ArtistsFootsteps">{{cite web

It is seen now as reflecting Australia's largest industry at the time and the work of ordinary Australians.  The painting is now in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]].<ref name="NGV">{{cite web

Today, major cultural institutions in the Riverina include the [[Museum of the Riverina]], the Riverina Theatre Company and the Wagga Wagga Art Gallery, all located in the regional centre of Wagga Wagga with outreach to the smaller towns.
