The '''Shrine of Remembrance''', located in [[Kings Domain]] on [[St Kilda Road, Melbourne|St Kilda Road]], [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] was built as a memorial to the men and women of [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] who served in [[World War I]] and is now a memorial to all Australians who have served in war. It is a site of annual observances of [[ANZAC Day]] (25 April) and [[Remembrance Day]] (11 November) and is one of the largest [[war memorial]]s in [[Australia]].

Designed by architects Phillip Hudson and James Wardrop who were both World War I veterans, the Shrine is in a [[classicism|classical]] style, being based on the [[Tomb of Mausolus]] at [[Halicarnassus]] and the [[Parthenon]] in [[Athens]].<ref name="TaylorP101" /> Built from [[Tynong, Victoria|Tynong]] [[granite]],<ref name="Royall" /> the Shrine originally consisted only of the central sanctuary surrounded by the ambulatory. The sanctuary contains the [[marble]] Stone of Remembrance, upon which is engraved the words "Greater love hath no man". Once a year, on 11 November at 11&nbsp;a.m. (Remembrance Day), a ray of sunlight shines through an aperture in the roof to light up the word "Love" in the inscription. Beneath the sanctuary lies the crypt, which contains a bronze statue of a soldier father and son, and panels listing every unit of the [[Australian Imperial Force]].
In 2002-2003 a Visitor Centre was built within the foundations of the Shrine. The visitor centre incorporates an education centre (including three classrooms and meeting room), an audio-visual centre, gallery space, a retail shop and an administration office, as well the Hall of Columns (in which the Changi Flag is on display) Gallery of Medals, entry courtyard and Remembrance Garden. The walls of both the entry courtyard and Remembrance Garden have been built to complement the Ray of Light ceremony that takes place on 11 November of every year.

The Shrine went through a prolonged process of development which began in 1918 with the initial proposal to build a Victorian memorial. Two committees were formed, the second of which ran a competition for the memorial's design. The winner was announced in 1922.<ref name="InglisP301-302" /> However, opposition to the proposal (led by [[Keith Murdoch]] and ''[[Herald Sun|The Herald]]'') forced the governments of the day to rethink the design, and a number of alternatives were proposed, the most significant of which was the ANZAC Square and [[cenotaph]] proposal of 1926. In response, [[John Monash|General Sir John Monash]] used the 1927 [[ANZAC Day]] march to garner support for the Shrine, and finally won the support of the Victorian government later that year. The foundation stone was laid on 11 November 1927, and the Shrine was officially dedicated on 11 November 1934.<ref name="TaylorP101-102">Taylor (2005), pp. 101<U+2013>102</ref>

==History==
[[Image:Melbourne CBD (View from the top of Shrine of Remembrance).jpg|thumb|250px|Ceremonial Avenue, looking towards the city of Melbourne from the shrine]]

===Conception: 1918&ndash;1922===
A war memorial in Melbourne was proposed as soon as the war ended in November 1918.<ref name="InglisP301">Inglis (2008), p. 301.</ref> In the early 1920s the Victorian state government appointed the War Memorials Advisory Committee, chaired by [[Walter Baldwin Spencer|Sir Baldwin Spencer]], which recommended an "arch of victory" over [[St Kilda Road, Melbourne|St Kilda Road]],<ref name="InglisP301-302">Inglis (2008), pp. 301&ndash;302.</ref> the major boulevard leading out of the city of Melbourne to the south. In August 1921 an executive committee was formed, with the former commander of the Australian forces in the war, [[John Monash|General Sir John Monash]], as its driving force. The committee soon abandoned the idea of an arch and proposed a large monumental memorial to the east of St Kilda Road,<ref name = "InglisP302"/> a position which would make it clearly visible from the centre of the city.<ref name="EducationProgramP3">{{cite book | url = http://www.shrine.org.au/files/documents/background-information.pdf | format=PDF| chapter = Background Information for Teachers | title = Shrine of Remembrance Education Program: Background Information | publisher = Shrine of Remembrance | date = | accessdate = 2008-07-12 | page = 3 }}</ref> A competition was launched in March 1922 to find a design for the new memorial, open both to British subjects residing in Australia and any Australian citizens who were residing overseas. A total of 83 entries were submitted,<ref name="InglisP302">Inglis (2008), p. 302.</ref> and in December 1923 the design offered by two Melbourne [[architect]]s (and war veterans), Phillip Hudson and James Wardrop, was announced as the winner.<ref name="PerryP483">Perry (2004), p. 483.</ref>

===Opposition and response: 1922&ndash;1927===
The winning design had a number of supporters, including publications such as ''[[The Age]]'' and [[George Augustine Taylor|George Taylor]]'s Sydney-based trade journal, ''Building'', prominent citizens including artist [[Norman Lindsay]] and [[University of Sydney]] Dean of Architecture, Leslie Wilkinson,<ref name="InglisP303">Inglis (2008), p. 303.</ref> and the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (who had been heavily involved in the competition).<ref name="SerleP471-472">Serle (1982), pp. 471&ndash;472.</ref> Nevertheless, the design was also fiercely criticised in some quarters<U+2014>especially by Keith Murdoch's ''Herald'', Murdoch reportedly describing the Shrine as "too severe, stiff and heavy, that there is no grace or beauty about it and that it is a tomb of gloom"<ref name="SerleP472">Serle (1982), p. 472.</ref><U+2014>on the grounds of its grandiosity, its severity of design and its expense. As part of the campaign against the Shrine proposal, the ''Herald'' searched for alternative concepts, arguing that the funds could be better spent on more practical projects such as a hospital or a war widow's home.<ref name="PerryP483-484">Perry (2004), pp. 483&ndash;484.</ref> Furthermore, some [[Christian]] churches also attacked the design as [[Paganism|pagan]] for having no [[crucifix|cross]] or other Christian element.<ref name="TaylorP101" />

The new Victorian [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government of 1924, under [[George Prendergast]], supported the ''Herald's'' view, and pushed for a memorial hospital instead of the Shrine. When the Labor government was replaced with [[John Allan (Australian politician)|John Allan]]'s [[National Party of Australia|Country]]/[[Nationalist Party of Australia|National]] coalition, the plan changed once again, leaning towards the earlier suggestion of an arch of victory to be built over St. Kilda Road. As a result of the debate, significant delays postponed the construction of the new memorial, so a temporary wood-and-plaster cenotaph was raised for the 1926 [[ANZAC day]] march. The success of the temporary cenotaph led the Victorian government to abandon the earlier project in 1926, and propose instead to build a permanent cenotaph in a large "ANZAC Square" at the top of Bourke St in front of [[Parliament House, Melbourne|Parliament House]].<ref name="InglisP304">Inglis (2008), p. 304.</ref> While this would have involved demolishing the [[Windsor Hotel (Melbourne)|Windsor Hotel]], one of Melbourne's favourite hotels,<ref name="TaylorP102">Taylor, p. 102.</ref> the new plan won the support of the ''Herald'', the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Soldiers League]] (RSL) and the [[Melbourne City Council]].<ref name="SheehanP9">Sheehan (2007), p. 9</ref>

Nevertheless, both Monash and [[Legacy Australia|Legacy]] still supported the Shrine. After a vote in favour of the Shrine by their executive council, Legacy started a public relations campaign, gaining the support of much of the media<U+2014>although the council, state government and the ''Herald'' continued to oppose.<ref name="SheehanP9" /> In 1927, with the then [[Duke of York]], [[George VI of the United Kingdom|Prince Albert]], visiting the country, Monash spoke on the eve of ANZAC day at the RSL dinner, arguing for the Shrine. The audience had been seeded with supporters, who provided a standing ovation at the conclusion of his speech, which helped to produce a groundswell of support. When a vote was called for, the majority voted in favour of the Shrine proposal.<ref name="PerryP497">Perry (2004), p. 497.</ref> The next day, with Monash leading 30,000 veterans in the 1927 ANZAC Day march, and with the new support of the RSL, The ''Age'', and the ''[[The Argus (Australia)|Argus]]'', the Shrine proposal had gained "new momentum".<ref name="PerryP499">Perry (2004), p. 499.</ref> Faced with such support, and with Monash's arguments that the ANZAC Square would be prohibitively expensive, [[Edmond Hogan]]'s new Labor government decided in favour of the Shrine.<ref name="PerryP499-500">Perry (2004), pp. 499&ndash;500.</ref>

Another early point of contention (although not explicitly related to the nature of the memorial) concerned the possibility of incorporating a "[[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]]" into the memorial<U+2014>an approach that was championed by the St. Kilda RSL, who revealed plans to bury a soldier from either [[Gallipoli]] or [[France]] on ANZAC day, April 25, 1922.<ref name="Inglis1999">{{cite journal | last = Inglis | first = K. S. | year = 1999 | title = The Unknown Australian Soldier | journal = Journal of Australian Studies }}</ref> This proposal received considerable debate, and was countered by the argument that the [[Unknown Warrior]] in [[Westminster Abbey]] represented all of the dead of the [[British Empire]]. Monash was on the side of those against such a burial, as while he could see a place for an Unknown Soldier in a national memorial, he did not feel that it would be suitable at the Victorian Shrine.<ref name="SerleP473">Serle (1982), p. 473.</ref> The Stone of Remembrance was later placed in the position where an Unknown Soldier might have been laid.<ref name="InglisP310">Inglis (2008), p. 310.</ref> An Australian Unknown Soldier was eventually interred at the [[Australian War Memorial]] by [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Paul Keating]] on 11 November 1993.<ref name="AustUnknownSoldier">{{cite web | title = Visitor information: Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier | work = [[Australian War Memorial]] | accessdate = 2008-07-12 | url = http://www.awm.gov.au/visit/?item=special&sub=tomb }}</ref>

[[Image:Dedication ceremony, Shrine of Remembrance, 1934.jpg|thumb|250px|The dedication ceremony for the Shrine of Remembrance. Over 300,000 people were in attendance, a figure that was approximately a third of Melbourne's population at the time.]]

===Construction and dedication: 1927&ndash;1934===
The foundation stone was laid on 11 November 1927, by the [[Governor of Victoria]], [[Arthur Herbert Tennyson Somers Cocks, 6th Baron Somers|Lord Somers]].<ref name="BuildingWithASoul">{{cite book | url = http://www.shrine.org.au/retrievemedia.asp?Media_ID=416 | chapter = Victoria's National Memorial | title = History of the shrine ... a building with a soul | publisher = Shrine of Remembrance | date = | accessdate = 2008-07-12  }}</ref> Although both the Victorian and Commonwealth governments made contributions, most of the cost of the Shrine (<U+00A3>160,000 out of a total of <U+00A3>250,000) was raised in less than six months by public contributions,<ref name="Hill">Hill (2003)</ref> with Monash as chief fundraiser.<ref name="InglisP307">Inglis (2008), p. 307.</ref>

Monash, who was also an [[engineer]],<ref name="ADB">Serle (1986), pp. 543&ndash;549</ref> took personal charge of the construction,<ref name="InglisP307" /> which began in 1928 and was handled by the contractors Vaughan & Lodge.<ref name="NationalTrustVictoria" /> Monash died in 1931, before the Shrine was finished,<ref name="ADB" /> but the Shrine was the cause "closest to his heart" in his later years.<ref name="SerleP471">Serle (1982), p. 471.</ref> 

Work was finally completed in September 1934, and the Shrine was formally dedicated on 11 November 1934 by the [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]], witnessed by a crowd of over 300,000 people<U+2014>a "massive turnout" given that Melbourne's population at the time was approximately 1&nbsp;million,<ref name="Wilson2004">Wilson (2004)</ref> and, according to Carl Bridge, the "largest crowd ever to assemble in Australia to that date".<ref name="Bridge">Bridge (2005)</ref>

[[Image:Shrine of Remembrance 1930.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Shrine in the 1930s showing the [[reflecting pool]] in front of the north face, where the World War II Forecourt is now located]]

===Post World War II: 1945&ndash;1985===
After [[World War II]] it was felt necessary to add to the Shrine an element commemorating the Australian war dead of the second great conflict. Once again a competition was run, with A. S. Fall and E. E. Milston as the joint winners.<ref name="IsaacsonP51">Isaacson (1999) p. 51.</ref> Milston's design was eventually chosen as the one to go ahead,<ref name="IsaacsonP52">Isaacson (1999) p. 52.</ref> and the result was the World War II Forecourt, a wide expanse of stone in front of the Shrine's north face; the Eternal Flame, a permanent gas flame set just to the west of the north face; and the World War II Memorial, a 12.5-metre-high (41&nbsp;ft) cenotaph a little further west.<ref name="TaylorP102" />  The Forecourt replaced a [[reflecting pool]] that had previously stood in front of the Shrine.  These enlargements were dedicated by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 28 February 1954.<ref name="IsaacsonP52" /> Australia's involvements in later wars, such as the [[Korean War]], the [[Malayan Emergency]], the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Gulf War]], are commemorated by inscriptions.<ref name="TaylorP102" />

In 1951 the body of [[Thomas Blamey|Field Marshal Sir Thomas Blamey]], Australia's military commander during World War II, was held at the Shrine for three days for public viewing followed by a State funeral on site. 20,000 people visited the Shrine as he lay in state.<ref name="Hetherington">Hetherington (1973), p. 399.</ref>

During the Vietnam War the Shrine became a centre of conflict when anti-war demonstrators protested during ANZAC Day services against Australia's involvement in the war.<ref name="InglisP359-360">Inglis (2008), pp. 359&ndash;360.</ref> In 1971 the Shrine was defaced when the word <small>PEACE!</small> was painted in large white letters on the pillars of the north portico.<ref name="InglisP360">Inglis (2008), p. 360.</ref> Despite vigorous cleaning, the porous nature of the stone used in the Shrine's construction meant that the slogan remained faintly visible for over 20 years.

In 1985 the Remembrance Garden was added beneath the western face of the Shrine to honour those who served during post-World War II conflicts.<ref name="EducationProgramP13">{{cite book | url = http://www.shrine.org.au/files/documents/background-information.pdf | format=PDF| chapter = Background Information for Teachers | title = Shrine of Remembrance Education Program: Background Information | publisher = Shrine of Remembrance | date = | accessdate = 2008-07-12 | page = 13 }}</ref>

[[Image:Melbourne war memorial02.jpg|thumb|250px|The Shrine after the completion of the 2002-2003 redevelopment.]]

===Redevelopment: 2002 &ndash; present day===
Restoration work on the terraces surrounding the Shrine during the 1990s raised once again the possibility of taking advantage of the space under the Shrine: as the Shrine had been built on a hollow artificial hill, the undercroft (although at the time filled with rubble from the construction) provided a large space for development.<ref name="TaylorP102" /> At a planned cost of $5.5 million, the new development was intended to provide a visitor's centre, administration facilities and an improved access to the Shrine's crypt, as many of the remaining veterans and their families found the stairs at the traditional ceremonial entrance difficult to climb.<ref name="Guerrera">Guerrera (2001), p. 8</ref> In redeveloping the site, special consideration was given to the positioning of the new entrance. The original plan was to use a tunnel from the east, but this was discarded as it had "no sense of ceremony". Instead it was decided to develop two new courtyards, and place the new gallery under the northern steps.<ref name="Redd">Reed (2003), p. 8.</ref> Construction commenced in 2002, with the design by Melbourne architects [[Ashton Raggatt McDougall]],<ref name="Day">Day (2003)</ref> and the new areas were opened in August 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasurer.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=speeches/2003/011.htm&pageID=05&min=phc&Year=2003&DocType=1|title=Speech at the opening of the Visitor Centre Shrine of Remembrance|first=Peter |last=Costello |authorlink=Peter Costello|publisher=Australian Government}}</ref> The completed project was awarded the Victorian Architecture Medal by the [[Royal Australian Institute of Architects]] in 2004.<ref name="Silkstone">Silkstone (2004)</ref>

After this construction was complete, there were still more calls to further develop the site, and especially to provide facilities for education about the wars.<ref name="Day" /> A $62&nbsp;million proposal was presented in 2006, incorporating a museum and an underground carpark. Designed once again by Ashton Raggatt McDougall, the proposal was opposed by local residents and some council members,<ref name="Kleinman">Kleinman (2006), p. 9.</ref> and ran into significant funding problems when the Federal Government decided not to help with funding.<ref name="Duck">Duck (2006), p. 7.</ref>

==Architecture and features==
[[Image:Shrine of Remembrance statue.jpg|thumb|200px|One of the four groups of statuary which mark the corners of the Shrine.]] 

Materials for building the Shrine were sourced from within Australia: the chosen building stone was [[granodiorite]] quarried from [[Tynong]];<ref name="Royall">Royall (2007)</ref> the internal walls use [[sandstone]] from [[Redesdale, Victoria|Redesdale]]; and the black marble columns used stone from [[Buchan, Victoria|Buchan]].<ref name="NationalTrustVictoria" /> This raised some concerns when redeveloping the Shrine, as the Tynong [[quarry]] was no longer in use, and it proved to be prohibitively expensive to reopen the site. Fortunately another quarry in the area was available and was able to provide the necessary stone.<ref name="Wilson2003">Wilson (2003), p. 6.</ref>

===Exterior===
The design of the Shrine is based on the ancient [[Mausoleum of Maussollos]] at Halicarnassus, one of the [[Seven Wonders of the World]], and the [[Parthenon]] in Athens.<ref name="TaylorP101">Taylor, p. 101.</ref> It is a structure of square plan roofed by a stepped [[pyramid]] and entered on the north and south through classical [[portico]]s, each of eight fluted [[Doric order|Doric]] columns supporting a pediment containing sculpture in high relief. The porticos are approached by wide flights of steps which rise in stages to the podium on which the Shrines sits.<ref name="NationalTrustVictoria">{{cite web | title = Shrine of Remembrance & Public Art | work = [[National Trust of Australia]] (Victoria) | url = http://www.nattrust.com.au/trust_register/search_the_register/shrine_of_remembrance_public_art | accessdate = 2008-07-12 }}</ref> The east and west facing fronts are marked at the corners by four groups of statuary by Paul Raphael Montford, representing [[Peace]], [[Justice]], [[Patriotism]] and [[Sacrifice]]. The [[Art Deco]] style and motifs draw on Greek and Assyrian sculpture. The symbolism is [[Neo-Classicism|Neo-Classical]]. 

Around the outer stone balustrade that marks the Shrines external boundary are the "battle honours" disks, 16 stone discs.<ref name="Shrine Exterior">{{cite web|url=http://www.shrine.org.au/content.asp?document_id=1081|title=Shrine Exterior|publisher=Shrine of Remembrance |accessdate=2008-07-13}}</ref> These represent the battle honours granted by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and commemorate Australia's contributions to the following battles: [[Landing at Anzac]], (that is, Gallipoli), [[Battle of Sari Bair|Sari Bair]], [[Battle of Romani|Rumani]], [[Third Battle of Gaza|Gaza-Beersheba]], the North Sea, the Cocos Islands, [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Megiddo]], Damascus, Villers Bretonneux, [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Amiens]], [[Battle of Mont St. Quentin|Mont St Quentin]], the [[Hindenburg Line]], [[Third Battle of Ypres|Ypres]], [[Battle of Messines|Messines]], [[Battle of Pozi<U+00E8>res|Pozieres]] and [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Bullecourt]].<ref name="Shrine Exterior"/> 

[[Image:shrine of remembrance inside view.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Sanctuary]]

===Interior===
Inside the Shrine is the Sanctuary, a high vaulted space entered by four tall portals of Classical design. A simple entabulature is carried on sixteen tall fluted [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns and supports a [[frieze]] with twelve relief panels sculptured by Lyndon Dadswell, depicting the armed services at work and in action during World War I.<ref name="InglisP308">Inglis (2008), p. 308.</ref>
At the centre of the Sanctuary is the Stone of Remembrance.<ref name ="EducationProgramP8-10"/> This is a [[marble]] stone sunk below the pavement, so that visitors must bow their heads to read the inscription on it:

:<small>GREATER LOVE HATH NO MAN</small>

The inscription is part of a verse from the [[Bible]] ([[John 15]]:13) "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends".<ref name ="EducationProgramP8-10">{{cite book | url = http://www.shrine.org.au/files/documents/background-information.pdf |format=PDF| chapter = The Sanctuary | title = Shrine of Remembrance Education Program: Background Information | publisher = Shrine of Remembrance | date = | accessdate = 2008-07-12 | pages = 8<U+2013>10}}</ref> The Stone is aligned with an aperture in the roof of the Sanctuary so that a ray of sunlight falls on the word <small>LOVE</small> on the Stone of Remembrance at exactly 11&nbsp;a.m. on 11 November, marking the hour and day of the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|Armistice]] which ended World War I. Since the introduction of [[daylight saving]] in Victoria, the ray of sunlight is no longer in the right place at 11&nbsp;a.m. A mirror has been installed to direct sunlight onto the Stone at 11&nbsp;a.m.<ref name ="EducationProgramP8-10"/> During the rest of the year, a light is used to simulate the effect.<ref name ="EducationProgramP8-10"/> 
[[Image:Ray of light, Shrine of Remembrance.jpg|thumb|200px|A ray of light hits the Stone of Remembrance in the Sanctuary, at 11am on November 11. (photo circa 1940)]] 

Monash, with the advice of Professor T. G. Tucker and the assistance of [[Bernard O'Dowd]] and Felix Meyer, reworded Phillip Hudson's inscription which appears on the western wall of the Shrine:<ref name="SerleP473" />

:<small>LET ALL MEN KNOW THAT THIS IS HOLY GROUND. THIS SHRINE, ESTABLISHED IN THE HEARTS OF MEN AS ON THE SOLID EARTH, COMMEMORATES A PEOPLE'S FORTITUDE AND SACRIFICE. YE THEREFORE THAT COME AFTER, GIVE REMEMBRANCE.</small>

This inscription again aroused criticism, according to Taylor, "for having no Christian, (or, indeed, [[religion|religious]]), element",<ref name="TaylorP102" /> but was considered to fit the Australian tradition of "stoic patriotism".<ref name="SerleP473" />

The inscription on the eastern wall, not written by Monash, reads: 

:<small>THIS MONUMENT WAS ERECTED BY A GRATEFUL PEOPLE TO THE HONOURED MEMORY OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVED THE EMPIRE IN THE GREAT WAR OF 1914<U+2013>1918.</small>

The Sanctuary is surrounded by an [[ambulatory]], or passage, along which are forty-two bronze caskets containing hand-written, [[illuminated (manuscript)|illuminated]] Books of Remembrance with the names of every Victorian who enlisted for active service with the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) or [[Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force]] in World War I or died in camp prior to embarkation.<ref name ="EducationProgramP8">{{cite book | url = http://www.shrine.org.au/files/documents/background-information.pdf | format=PDF | chapter = The Ambulatory | title = Shrine of Remembrance Education Program: Background Information | publisher = Shrine of Remembrance | date = | accessdate = 2008-07-13 | page = 8 }}</ref>

===Crypt===
Beneath the Sanctuary is the [[Crypt]] containing a bronze statue of a father and son, representing the two generations who served in the two world wars.<ref name ="EducationProgramP6-7">{{cite book | url = http://www.shrine.org.au/files/documents/background-information.pdf | format=PDF| chapter = The Crypt | title = Shrine of Remembrance Education Program: Background Information | publisher = Shrine of Remembrance | date = | accessdate = 2008-07-13 | pages = 6<U+2013>7 }}</ref>  Around the walls are panels listing every unit of the AIF, down to [[battalion]] and [[regiment]], along with the colours of their shoulder patch.  The Crypt is hung with the standards of various battalions and regiments, listing their battle honours.

===Visitor Centre===
Visitors approach the shrine through the Entrance Courtyard, with "Lest We Forget" inscribed on one wall and a quote from former Governor-General [[Sir William Deane]] on the other.<ref name="EducationProgramP4">{{cite book | url = http://www.shrine.org.au/files/documents/background-information.pdf | format=PDF| chapter = The Entry Courtyard | title = Shrine of Remembrance Education Program: Background Information | publisher = Shrine of Remembrance | date = | accessdate = 2008-07-15 | page = 4}}</ref> The Garden Courtyard, on the same alignment, features the [[Legacy Australia|Legacy]] [[Olive]] Tree and a seating area.

[[Image:Shirne of Remembrance (Flame of the War Memorial).jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Cenotaph and Eternal Flame]]

===World War II Forecourt===
The cenotaph is a tall pillar constructed of [[Harcourt, Victoria|Harcourt Granite]]. Inscribed on its surface are the names of the defence forces, together with the theatres of war they served in.<ref name ="EducationProgramP12-13">{{cite book | url = http://www.shrine.org.au/files/documents/background-information.pdf | format=PDF| chapter = World War II Forecourt | title = Shrine of Remembrance Education Program: Background Information | publisher = Shrine of Remembrance | date = | accessdate = 2008-07-15 | pages = 12<U+2013>13 }}</ref> Atop the cenotaph is a [[basalt]] sculpture of six servicemen carrying a [[bier]] with a corpse, draped by the [[flag of Australia|Australian flag]]. The sculpture symbolises "the debt of the living to the dead". The [[Eternal Flame]] is placed nearby, representing eternal life.<ref name ="EducationProgramP12-13"/> The flame is kept alight at all times and in all weather conditions.<ref name ="EducationProgramP12-13"/>

At the other side of the forecourt are three flagpoles. The usual arrangement comprises the Australian flag on the left, the [[Flag of Victoria|Victorian flag]] in the middle and one of the flags of the three defence forces on the right.

===Shrine Reserve and environs===
Although the original architects had proposed including four statues of war leaders, Monash rejected this plan. Instead there were to be no statues representing individual members of the [[Australian Defence Force]] at the shrine itself, although a number of statues were to be added in the surrounding parklands.<ref name="InglisP308-310" /> The first of these was "The Man With The Donkey" representing [[John Simpson Kirkpatrick]], although he was not named on the statue, and officially the work is said to represent the "valour and compassion of the Australian soldier".<ref name ="EducationProgramP14-15">{{cite book | url = http://www.shrine.org.au/files/documents/background-information.pdf | format=PDF| chapter = The Shrine Reserve | title = Shrine of Remembrance Education Program: Background Information | publisher = Shrine of Remembrance | date = | accessdate = 2008-07-13 | pages = 14<U+2013>15 }}</ref> Nearby is the [[Lone Pine (tree)|Lone Pine]] (''[[Pinus brutia]]'').

The Shrine is set in a large expanse of parkland officially called [[Kings Domain, Melbourne|Kings Domain]]. Over the years many other war memorials have been built in this area, including the Australian-Hellenic Memorial to Australian and Greek dead in the Battles of Greece and [[Crete]] in 1941, and statues of Monash and Blamey. Most of the trees which line the approaches to the Shrine bear plaques commemorating individual [[Australian Army|Army]] units, naval vessels or [[Royal Australian Air Force|Air Force]] squadrons, placed there by veterans' groups. An older memorial to Victorians killed in the [[Second Boer War]] of 1899<U+2013>1902 is also located nearby on the corner of St Kilda and Domain Roads.<ref name ="EducationProgramP16-20">{{cite book | url = http://www.shrine.org.au/files/documents/background-information.pdf | format=PDF |chapter = Outside the Shrine Reserve | title = Shrine of Remembrance Education Program: Background Information | publisher = Shrine of Remembrance | date = | accessdate = 2008-07-13 | pages = 16<U+2013>20 }}</ref>

The Driver and Wipers Memorial, also in the Shrine reserve, commemorates the thousands of Australian lives lost during the fighting at [[Battle of Passchendaele|Ypres]]; "Wipers" is the way servicemen pronounced "Ypres" during World War I.<ref name ="EducationProgramP14-15"/> The bronze soldiers are the work of the British sculptor [[Charles Sargeant Jagger]] and originally stood outside the Museum and [[State Library of Victoria]] in Melbourne.<ref name ="EducationProgramP14-15"/> They were transferred to the Shrine in 1998.<ref name ="EducationProgramP14-15"/> The Driver is a soldier holding a horse whip and bridles, wearing breeches,a protective legging, spurs, and a steel helmet, and the figure is a recasting of one of the figures from the [[Royal Artillery Memorial]] in Hyde Park, London, UK. The other bronze, the "Wipers" figure, is a British infantry soldier standing guard with standard issue .303 rifle, bayonet fixed, a German helmet at his feet. This too is a recasting, taken from the [[Hoylake and West Kirby War Memorial]] in Merseyside, UK.<ref name=melbourne>{{cite web | url=http://www.shrine.org.au/files/documents/background-information.pdf | format=PDF| title=The Driver and Wipers Memorial | publisher=Shrine of Remembrance Education Program | date= | accessdate=2007-07-09 }}</ref>

==Commemorative services==
[[Image:Operation Pedestal commemoration Melbourne 2006.jpg|thumb|250px|A parade during a ceremony commemorating [[Operation Pedestal]] near the Shrine]]

For the past 70 years the Shrine has been the centre of war commemoration in Melbourne. Although Remembrance Day (11 November) is the official day for commemorating the war dead, it has gradually been eclipsed in the public estimation by ANZAC Day (25 April), which unlike Remembrance Day is a specifically Australian (and [[New Zealand]]) day of commemoration. ANZAC day at the Shrine is observed through a number of ceremonies. The first of these is the Dawn Service, an event that attracted a record crowd of more than 35,000 in 2007.<ref name="Harrison">Harrison (2007)</ref>  This is followed by an official [[wreath]]-laying service where officials march to the Shrine and lay wreaths in the Sanctuary. Later, the ANZAC Day March  approaches the Shrine via St Kilda Road and the forecourt, before being dismissed at the steps and is followed by a commemoration service held between 1:00 and 1:30&nbsp;p.m.<ref name="ANZAC Day">{{cite web|url=http://www.shrine.org.au/content.asp?document_id=1324|title=ANZAC Day|publisher=Shrine of Remembrance |accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref>

On Remembrance Day, Victorian leaders and community members gather to commemorate "the sacrifices made by Australians in all wars and conflicts".<ref name="Remembrance Day at the Shrine">{{cite web|url=http://www.shrine.org.au/content.asp?document_id=999|title=Remembrance Day at the Shrine|publisher=Shrine of Remembrance |accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref> A minutes silence is observed at 11&nbsp;a.m.<ref name="Remembrance Day 2008">{{cite web|url=http://www.shrine.org.au/content.asp?document_id=1825|title=Remembrance Day 2008|publisher=Shrine of Remembrance |accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref> as the Ray of Light illuminates the word LOVE on the Stone of Remembrance.<ref name="Remembrance Day at the Shrine"/> 

Throughout the rest of the year, ceremonies and wreath laying services are held by Victorian unit associations and [[battalion]]s in the Sanctuary, around memorials in the Shrine Reserve  and near remembrance trees specific to various associations.<ref name="Ceremonies">{{cite web|url=http://www.shrine.org.au/content.asp?document_id=1230|title=Ceremonies and Wreath Laying|publisher=Shrine of Remembrance |accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref>

==Management==
The Shrine is managed by the Shrine of Remembrance Trustees, eight individuals appointed by the Governor in Council, on the advice of the Minister for Planning in the [[Victorian Government]].<ref name="Annual Report">{{cite web|url=http://www.shrine.org.au/files/documents/Shrine-annual-report_03-04.pdf|format=PDF|title= Annual Report 2003 - 2004|publisher=Shrine of Remembrance|accessdate = 2008-07-13}}</ref> The Trustees are responsible for the care, management, maintenance and preservation of the Shrine and Shrine Reserve.<ref name="Annual Report"/> 

Traditionally, security for the Shrine has been provided by the Shrine Guard, whose members were men with a military background. All of the original twelve members of the Shrine Guard had won bravery medals during World War I.<ref name="Minchin">Minchin (2005), p. 9.</ref> When the Shrine Guard merged with the [[Victoria Police]] Protective Service, some civilians began to serve.<ref name="Minchin" /> During the hours the Shrine is open to the public or in use for any ceremony, they wear a uniform representing an [[Australian Light Horse]]man of World War I, with Victoria Police Force insignia.<ref name="Shrine Guard">{{cite web|url=http://www.shrine.org.au/content.asp?document_id=1004|title=Shrine Guard|publisher=Shrine of Remembrance |accessdate=2008-07-13}}</ref>
