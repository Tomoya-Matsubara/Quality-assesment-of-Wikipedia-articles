==History==

Before 1958, the entire State of Florida was under the jurisdiction of one diocese, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint Augustine]]. In the 1950s and early 1960s, Saint Augustine archbishop [[Joseph Patrick Hurley]] purchased land throughout South Florida in anticipation of a future population boom.<ref>{{cite web| last=Gannon| first=Michael| title=The Builder Bishop| publisher=''Saint Augustine Catholic''| date=2007-10-30| url=http://www.staugcatholic.org/feature2.shtml| accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref> Today, these once remote areas are thriving cities. Dozens of Catholic churches, schools and cemeteries built on the land purchased by Hurley dot these areas.<ref name="anniversary" />

The Diocese of Miami was created on [[October 7]], [[1958]], with [[Coleman Carroll]] installed as [[bishop]]. The diocese included the 16 southern counties in Florida, with a Catholic population of 200,000. It encompassed one half of the area of the state. Less than a year after the creation of the diocese, [[Fidel Castro]] came to power in [[Cuba]]. This set off a mass exodus of [[Cuban exile]]s to South Florida. The Catholic Welfare Bureau, created by Carroll, played a significant part in helping these waves of Cuban immigrants. Between 1960 and 1962, 14,000 Cuban children were sent to the United States. [[Operation Pedro Pan]], created by Monsignor [[Bryan O. Walsh]], placed them with friends, relatives or the Catholic Welfare Bureau. In 1996, the Catholic Welfare Bureau changed its name to Catholic Charities. Today it claims to be the largest non-governmental provider of social services in South Florida. It served over 17,000 families in the tri-county area of Broward, Dade and Monroe counties in 2006.<ref>{{cite web| last=Catholic Charities| title=Catholic Charities History| publisher=Catholic Charities| url=http://www.catholiccharitiesadm.org/who_we_are.htm| accessdate=2007-08-16}}</ref>[[Image:Mariel Refugees.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Cuban refugees arriving in crowded boats during the Mariel Boatlift crisis.]]

Due to an increased population, the diocese was divided in 1968. Eight counties became part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of St. Petersburg|Diocese of St. Petersburg]] and the new [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando|Diocese of Orlando]]. Miami was made an Archdiocese by [[Pope Paul VI]], and was named Metropolitan See for all of Florida. Carroll became an archbishop on March 2, 1968.<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiarchdiocese.org/ip.asp?op=A152500&lg=E|title=Archdiocese of Miami: History - Made an Archdiocese|author=Miami Archdiocese|publisher=Miami Archdiocese|accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref> Carroll is credited with eliminating [[racial segregation]] in Catholic schools in 1963, while [[desegregation]] in Florida public schools was not accomplished until the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite web| last=The Florida Memory Project| title=Florida Timeline| publisher=The Florida Memory Project| url=http://www.floridamemory.com/Timeline/| accessdate=2007-11-10}}</ref> He participated in the church reforms of [[Vatican II]] as one of the Council Fathers.<ref name="anniversary" />

Upon the death of Carroll on July 26, 1977, Bishop [[Edward Anthony McCarthy]] was appointed as Miami's archbishop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiarchdiocese.org/ip.asp?op=A153000&lg=El|title=Archdiocese of Miami: History - First Successor|author=Miami Archdiocese|publisher=Miami Archdiocese|accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref><ref name="McCarthy">{{cite web|url=http://www.mccarthyhigh.org/about.html|title=Archbishop McCarthy High School - About Us|author=McCarthy High School|publisher=McCarthy High School|accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> McCarthy oversaw the construction of the Pastoral Center for the archdiocese and restructured most senior operational divisions. He established the Office of [[Lay Ecclesial Ministry]], the Office of [[Evangelization]] and the [[Deacon|Permanent Diaconate]] program. In 1980, he offered support and assistance during the [[Mariel Boat Lift]]. The following year, he supported the rights of [[Haiti]]an immigrants who were detained under the [[Wet feet, dry feet policy|Wet Foot, Dry Foot]] policy. Responding to the needs of this new immigration, he opened the [[Pierre Toussaint]] Haitian Catholic Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiarchdiocese.org/ip.asp?op=A154500&lg=E|title=Archdiocese of Miami: History - More Exiles|author=Miami Archdiocese|publisher=Miami Archdiocese|accessdate=2007-04-19}}</ref><ref name="McCarthy" /> McCarthy retired in 1994 at the required age of 75.<ref name="anniversary" /> 

The present archbishop of Miami, John Favalora, was appointed by [[Pope John Paul II]] on November 3, 1994. During his tenure, he has built two new high schools and nine grade schools. Favalora also initiated the Vision 2000 campaign, a five-year fund-raising campaign that created an [[Financial endowment|endowment]] fund to support Catholic education and outreach institutions in the archdiocese. The effort raised $90 million ([[USD]]).<ref name="anniversary" /> On July 11, 2003, Pope John Paul II appointed Miami auxiliary bishop [[Thomas Gerard Wenski]] to lead the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando]].<ref name="usatoday">{{cite web| last=Grossman| first=Cathy Lynn| title=Vacancies Occupy Catholic Church| publisher=''USA Today''| date=2003-07-23| url=http://www.snapnetwork.org/news/vatican/vacancies_occupy.htm| accessdate=2007-08-16}}</ref><ref name="usatoday2">{{cite web| last=Grossman| first=Cathy Lynn| title=Church vacancies will leave room at the top of dioceses| publisher=''USA Today''| date=2003-07-23| url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/354000471.html?dids=354000471:354000471&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jul+2%2C+2003&author=Cathy+Lynn+Grossman&pub=USA+TODAY&edition=&startpage=D.08&desc=Church+vacancies+will+leave+room+at+the+top+of+dioceses| accessdate=2007-08-16}}</ref> With substantial immigration of predominantly Catholic South and Central Americans to the South Florida area, the Catholic population there is 25% of the total population.

In 1997, soon after becoming archbishop, John Favalora responded to these scandals by adopting the Charter for the Protection of Young People. This charter, which was adopted by all U.S. bishops several years later in response to similar abuse in other dioceses, requires all priests, employees, and volunteers of the Archdiocese to be fingerprinted and have a background check.<ref name="charteryouth">{{Cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/ocyp/charter.shtml|title=Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People|accessdate=2007-10-08|publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|year=2005|author=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops}}</ref><ref name="anniversary" /> All allegations of sexual abuse are required to be reported to the police. Suspected offenders are suspended pending the outcome of an investigation. If the allegations are deemed by investigators to be credible, the suspected offender is relieved of duties and prosecuted. Counseling is offered for victims.
