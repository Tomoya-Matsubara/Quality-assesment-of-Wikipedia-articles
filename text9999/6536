'''Lenton Priory''' was a [[Cluniac]] monastic house, founded by [[William Peverel]] in the early 12th century. The exact date of foundation is unknown but 1102-8 is frequently quoted. The priory was granted a large endowment of property in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire by its founder, however part of this property became the cause of violent disagreement following its seizure by the crown and its reassignment to [[Lichfield Cathedral]]. The priory was home mostly to French monks until the late 14th century when the priory was freed from the control of it's foreign mother-house. From the 13th-century the priory struggled financially and was noted for "its poverty and indebtedness". The priory was dissolved as part of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]'s [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]].

==History==
===Foundation===
Lenton priory was established in [[Lenton, Nottingham]], around 1<U+00BD> miles south-west of [[Nottingham]]. The priory was founded by [[William Peverel]] around 1102-8, and dedicated to the [[Holy Trinity]]. The charter of foundation states that Peverel founded the charter "out of love of divine worship and for the good of the souls of his lord [[William the Conqueror|King William]], of his wife [[Matilda of Flanders|Queen Matlida]], of their son [[William II of England|King William]] and of all their and his ancestors". The priory was an alien establishment (one which owed allegiance to a foreign mother house). Lenton's mother-house was [[Cluny Abbey]] in France. Usually priory would pay a proportion of its income to its mother-house, however Peverel established in the foundation charter that Lenton Priory would be free from the obligation to pay tribute to Cluny, "save the annual payment of a mark of silver as an acknowledgement".<ref name=BH>{{cite book|last=Page|first=William|title='House of Cluniac monks: The priory of Lenton', A History of the County of Nottingham: Volume 2|year=1910|publisher=Victoria County History|pages=91-100|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=40086}}</ref>

William Peverel gave Lenton Priory a substantial endowment which included: the townships of [[Lenton, Nottingham|Lenton]], [[List_of_lost_settlements_in_the_United_Kingdom#Nottinghamshire.5B109.5D|Keighton]], [[Morton, Nottinghamshire|Morton]] and [[Radford, Nottingham|Radford]] (all in Nottingham), [[Courteenhall, Northamptonshire]], and all of their [[appurtenances]] and seven mills; land and woodland in [[Newthorpe, Nottinghamshire|Newthorpe]] and [[Papplewick]]; control of the churches of [[St Mary's Church, Nottingham|St. Mary]], [[St Peter's Church, Nottingham|St. Peter]] and [[St Nicholas' Church, Nottingham|St. Nicholas]], all in [[Nottingham]]; the churches at [[Langar, Nottinghamshire|Langar]], [[Linby]] and[[Radford, Nottingham|Radford]]; the [[tithes]] raised from Peverel's fisheries throughout Nottingham; portions of the tithes from his lands throughout the [[Peak District]] including those from [[Ashford-in-the-Water|Ashford]], [[Bakewell]], [[Bradwell, Derbyshire|Bradwell]], [[Buxton]], [[Callow, Derbyshire|Callow]], [[Chelmorton]], [[King Sterndale|Cowdale]], [[Darnall]], Dunningestede, [[Whaley Bridge|Fernilee]], Holme, [[Great Hucklow|Hucklow]], [[Newbold, Derbyshire|Newbold]], Quatford, [[Shallcross, Derbyshire|Shallcross]], [[Stanton, Derbyshire|Stanton]], [[King Sterndale|Sterndale]], [[Tideswell]] and [[Wormhill]]; all the tithes raised from his colts and fillies in his stud-farms in the Peak District; the tithes from the lead and venision from his lands in Derbyshire; part of the tithes from [[Blisworth]] and [[Duston]] and the churches of [[Courteenhall]], [[Harlestone]], [[Irchester]] and [[Rushden]], all in [[Northamptonshire]]; and the church at [[Foxton, Leicestershire|Foxton]], in Leicestershire.<ref name=BH/>

Although it is believed Peverel did give theses gifts to the priory, the charter of foundation which documents these gifts is believed to be a fake. The dates on the charter are implausible and the document is believed not to be contemporary.<ref name=BH/>

In the 13th century the priory received a gift from [[Philip Marc]], King John's sheriff in Nottingham, with the condition that the priory look after his body and soul.<ref name=meet>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=B7FJAAAAMAAJ&lpg=RA3-PA126&ots=InSbncLfgJ&dq=%22philip%20marc%22%20sheriff&pg=RA3-PA126&ci=153,534,825,830&source=bookclip Memoirs Illustrative of the History and Antiquities of the County and City of York], Communicated to the Annual Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, York, July, 1816, p126, with a General Report of the Proceedings of the Meeting, and Catalogue of the Museum Formed on that Occasion By Royal Archaeological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland,  Royal Archaeological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, accessed 16 September 2008</ref>

The priory was given Royal Confirmation Charters by [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]], [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]], [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] and [[John, King of England|King John]]. These charters confirm the priory's earlier endowments and reveals additional gifts including: The church of [[Wigston]] in Leicestershire by [[Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester]]; tithes from the Peak Forest, Derbyshire, by [[William de Ferrers (disambiguation)|William de Ferrers]]; the churches of [[Ossington]], Nottinghamshire and [[Horsley, Derbyshire]], and half of the church of [[Cotgrave]], Notts, by Hugh de Buron and his son Hugh Meschines; the church of [[Nether Broughton]], Leics (and its appurtenances, a chapel and 15 acres of land) by Richard Bussell; The Manors of Holme and [[Dunston, Derbyshire|Dunston]], both in Derbyshire, by Matthew de Hathersage; and a [[moiety title|moiety]] of the church of [[Attenborough, Nottinghamshire]], "the land of Reginald in Chilwell", [[Barton in Fabis]] church, and part of the tithes in [[Bunny, Nottinghamshire|Bunny]] and [[Bradmore, Nottinghamshire|Bradmore]], by Odo de Bunny.<ref name=BH/>

[[Henry II of England|King Henry II]]'s first charter granted the priory freedom from taxes, tolls, and customs duties. The second charter he granted them an eight-day fair to celebrate [[St. Martin's Day]]. [[Henry III of England|Henry III]]'s charter extended this fair to twelve days in length.<ref name=BH/> In 1199 King John issued a charter allowing the monks to take a cart of deadwood from "the forest of Bestwood" every day. In another charter towards the end of his reign, King John granted the monks game ("harts, hinds, bucks, does, wild boars, and hares") from the royal forests in Nottingham and Derby.<ref name=BH/>

====Endowment Disputes====
The priory had severe ongoing problems with Peverel's donations following the seizure of the Peverel family estates by the crown, during the reign of [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]]. King Henry granted the Peverel families lands within the Peak District to his son, John Count of Mortain (the future [[John, King of England|King John of England]]). On his ascendancy to the throne, John transferred this property to the [[Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield]] and in turn it passed to the Dean and Chapter of [[Lichfield Cathedral]]. This transfer started approximately 300 years of disagreement between the Priory and Cathedral about who was rightful owner of the property. Litigation continued throughout this period, including suits in the Vatican Court on several occasions.<ref name=BH/>

This disagreement became violent when in 1250-1, the monks of Lenton Priory armed themselves and attempted to steal wool and lambs from the disputed parish of [[Tideswell]], Derbyshire, which Lichfield controlled. Preempting the monk's attack the Dean of the cathedral ordered the wool and sheep to be kept within the nave of the village church, however the monks of Lenton did not honour the church's sanctuary rights and broke into the building. A fight ensued and 18 lambs were killed within the church, either trampled under the horses' hooves or butchered by the attackers weapons. The monks managed to carry off 14 of the lambs.<ref name=BH/>

In another similar attack around the same time, the monks used violence to steal geese, hay and oats. These attacks caused the Bishop of Lichfield to appeal again to the Pope. [[Pope Innocent IV]] assembled a commission which met in 1252 at St. Mary's Church in Leicester. The commission included The warden of the [[Greyfriars, Leicester|Franciscans of Leicester]], the [[Chester Cathedral|Archdeacon of Chester]], and the Prior of the Dominicans of London. The commission ruled Lenton Priory should be fined 100 marks on top of the <U+00A3>60 they had already paid Lichfield Cathedral in "compensation for the damage". The commission attempted to prevent further violent outbreaks by allotting the priory a portion of the [[tithes]] from some of the disputed parishes. This, however, provided less than 25 years of peace, as the dispute was reignited in 1275 and was "frequently renewed up to the time of the dissolution of the religious houses".<ref name=BH/>

===13th and 14th centuries===
In 1228 the priory church tower collapsed. The following year King Henry III granted the monks quarry rights in the Royal Nottingham Forest so that they could get stone to rebuild the tower. Henry III made numerous other donations to the priory to allow further building and restoration including: oak to make roofing shingle for the monk's domatory, (in 1232) thirty Sherwood oaks to build the priory church, and (in 1249) a royal licence to quarry stone from Sherwood forest to construct the priory church.<ref name=BH/>

The majority of the monks at Lenton came from France. Not used to the colder climate in England, in the winter of 1257/58, [[Pope Alexander IV]] had to give permission for the monks to wear caps during church services due to the "vehement cold".<ref name=BH/>

By 1262 the priory was considerably in debt. The priory's accounts were inspected by Henry, Prior of Bermondsey, and John ,Prior of the French house of Gassicourt, on behalf of the Abbot of [[Cluny Abbey]]. Their inspection reveal the priory was home twenty-two monks and that the priory was around <U+00A3>1,000 in debt. This amount was a substantial: around three times the priory's gross annual income, as demonstrated by the 1291 tax records of [[Pope Nicholas IV]], which record the priory as having an annual income of only <U+00A3>339 1s. 2<U+00BD>d.<ref name=BH/>

As an alien priory, owing allegiance to a mother-house in France, during war with France the priory's income was seized by the Crown. This happened repeatedly in the 14th century,<ref name=BH/> until, in 1392, the priory was removed from its mother-houses' control (made denizen).<ref name=PS>[http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=317538 Lenton Priory], ''English Heritage: PastScape''</ref>

The priory is believed to have had the finest set of guest-chambers around Nottingham, and as such the priory received a number of royal visits, including: Henry III in 1230, Edward I in 1302 and 1303, Edward II in 1307 and 1323, and Edward III in 1336.<ref name=BH/>


The priory had not solved its debt problems by the beginning of the 14th century. By May 1313 the priory was noted for "its poverty and indebtedness". King Edward II placed the priory under his protection and appointed a keeper to oversee the priory's affairs.<ref name=BH/>

===Dissolution===
The ''[[Valor Ecclesiasticus]]'' of 1534 records the priory as having a gross income of <U+00A3>387 10s. 10<U+00BD>d., as well as having "considerable" outgoings.<ref name=BH/>


Lenton's last prior was Nicholas Heath (or Hethe). He was appointed in 1535, having gained the position due to his connection to [[Thomas Cromwell]]. Numerous letters to Cromwell exist, from Heath's time as prior.<ref name=BH/>

Prior Heath was thrown into prison in February 1538, along with many of his monks. They were accused of high treason, most likely under the Verbal Treasons Act of December 1534. In March, the prior with eight of his monks (Ralph Swenson, Richard Bower, Richard Atkinson, Christopher Browne, John Trewruan, John Adelenton, William Berry, and William Gylham) and four labourers of [[Lenton, Nottingham|Lenton]] were indicted for treason and executed. Cromwell's private notes reveal Heath's fate (to be executed) was sealed before he had gone to trial.<ref name=BH/>

The prior and monk Ralph Swenson were executed first. Monk William Gylham and the four labourers were sentenced to be hung, drawn an quartered. The executions took place in Nottingham (thought to have been in the market place) and its surroundings, including in front of the priory itself. Some of the quarters of those executed were displayed outside the priory.<ref name=BH/>

The priory was dissolved in 1538.<ref name=PS/> As the monks and prior had been executed, none were given a pension; Unusually none of the servants of the priory were given a pension either, and the five paupers who lived within the priory were thrown out onto the streets, "penniless".<ref name=BH/>

===Lenton Fair===
The second royal charter [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] granted the priory gave the monks permission to hold an eight-day fair starting on [[St. Martin's Day|The Feast of Saint Martin]]: 11 November. In 1232, [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]]'s charter extended the length of the fair to twelve days.<ref name=BH/> 

The fair provided a large proportion of the priory's annual income: in 1387 providing <U+00A3>35 of the priory's <U+00A3>300 annual income.<ref name=BH/>


The fair caused numerous disputes with the mayor and [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]] of the town of Nottingham.<ref name=BH/>
<br>The town and priory reached an agreement around 1300 where by no markets were to be held within Nottingham during the period in the Lenton fair. In return the people of Nottingham were given special rates to hire booths at the Lenton fair and were freed from their tolls to Lenton Priory during the time of the fair. Each booth measured 8ft by 8ft.<ref name=BH/>

|}


The Fair continued after the demise of the Priory, though its length was gradually reduced. Its emphasis slowly changed, and in 1584 it was described as a horse-fair when servants of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] attended.<ref>Lodge, Edmund, ed., ''Illustrations of British History'', vol.2 (1791), p.303.</ref> By the 17th century the Fair had acquired a reputation as a great fair for all sorts of horses. In the 19th century it was largely frequented by farmers and horse dealers. The Fair finally ceased at the beginning of the 20th century.

==History Following Dissolution==
[[Image:Sempronius Stretton by William Salter.jpg|right|thumb|Sempronius Stretton's portrait by [[William Salter (artist)|William Salter]]]]
The monastery's lands swapped hands frequently after the dissolution.<ref name=BH/>

The area was bought by [[William Stretton]] in 1802 and he built a large house called "The Priory". William was interested in antiquities and he is known to have removed old architectural materials whilst his house was being constructed. The funds for the house may well have come from the buildings that he and his father built in the Nottingham area. When William died he left the house to his son Sempronius. Colonel [[Sempronius Stretton]] died in 1842 and left the house to his brother [[Severus William Lynam Stretton]]. Neither of the sons regarded the Priory as home and Severus sold the house and it was bought by the [[Sisters of Nazareth]] in 1880.<ref>[http://www.lentontimes.co.uk/back_i_21_30.htm The Strettons and <U+2018>The Priory<U+2019>], Lenton Times, accessed August 2009</ref> The Sisters of Nazareth sold up in the early years of the twenty-first century, and the site was re-developed for housing.
