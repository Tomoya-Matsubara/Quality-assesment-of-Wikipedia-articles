'''Henry Taylor''' (17&nbsp;March 1885 &ndash; 28&nbsp;February 1951<ref>Lawson and Johnson (1997), p.&nbsp;49.</ref><ref name="Golden">{{cite web |title=The golden boy town forgot |work=[[Oldham Advertiser]] |author=Lee Sykes |url=http://www.oldhamadvertiser.co.uk/community/nostalgia/s/1021934_the_golden_boy_town_forgot |date=3&nbsp;March 2007}} Retrieved on 28&nbsp;August 2008.</ref>) was a British [[Freestyle swimming|freestyle swimmer]] who competed in the [[1906 Summer Olympics]], in the [[1908 Summer Olympics]], in the [[1912 Summer Olympics]], and in the [[1920 Summer Olympics]]. He served in the [[Royal Navy]] during the First World War, and continued to swim competitively until 1926. Taylor's fortunes went downhill after he retired and he died penniless. His record of three gold medals at one Olympic Games&nbsp;&ndash; the most by any Briton&nbsp;&ndash; stood for 100&nbsp;years until it was equalled by cyclist [[Chris Hoy]] in 2008.

==Early life==
Henry Taylor was born in the [[Hollinwood, Greater Manchester|Hollinwood]] area of [[Oldham]], in [[Lancashire]], on 17&nbsp;March 1885 to James, a [[coal mining|coal miner]], and Elizabeth Taylor. Both of Henry's parents died when he was young and he was raised by his older brother, Bill.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web |title=Oldham's triple gold Olympian |publisher=BBC Online |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2008/08/20/200808_henry_taylor_feature.shtml |date=20&nbsp;August 2008}} Retrieved on 28&nbsp;August 2008.</ref> Taylor learned to swim in the [[Hollinwood Canal]], and practised in [[Alexandra Park, Oldham|Alexandra Park]]'s boating lake.<ref name="Golden"/> At the age of 7 Taylor swam in his first race.<ref>{{cite web |title=When Henry ruled the waves |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Helen Pidd |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/20/olympicsaquatics.olympics2008?gusrc=rss&feed=sport |date=20&nbsp;August 2008}} Retrieved on 29&nbsp;August 2008.</ref>

Bill became his coach and Henry also trained in the Oldham Baths and, from 1894, in the [[Chadderton]] Baths. During this time he continued to train in the canal also, and when he got a job at a cotton mill, he would spend his lunch times swimming in the canal.<ref name="BBC"/> At 5'&nbsp;5<nowiki>''</nowiki> (1.65&nbsp;m) and weighing 10&nbsp;stone 6&nbsp;pounds (66&nbsp;kg), he wore a hand-woven silk swimming costume weighing about an ounce.<ref name="Chronicle">{{cite web |title=Another 24 hours, another Olympic record |work=[[Oldham Evening Chronicle]] |author=Janice Barker |url=http://www.oldham-chronicle.co.uk/news-features/8/news/13085/another-24-hours-another-olympic-record |date=20&nbsp;August 2008}} Retrieved on 29&nbsp;August 2008.</ref>

==Career==
Taylor came to attention after success with Chadderton Swimming Club.<ref name="Golden"/> He was selected for the [[1906 Intercalated Games]] in [[Athens]]. Although he was not expected to win any medals he won a gold medal in the one mile freestyle,<ref name="BBC"/> as well as a silver in the 400&nbsp;m freestyle and a bronze in the 4<U+00D7>250&nbsp;m freestyle. Later in 1906, Taylor broke the world record for {{convert|880|yd|m}}. He was an automatic selection for the [[1908 Summer Olympics]].<ref name="BBC"/>

During the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, Taylor won gold medals in each of the three events in which he took part:<ref name="BBC"/> the 400&nbsp;m freestyle, the 4<U+00D7>200&nbsp;m freestyle, and the 1500&nbsp;m freestyle. He finished first in all of the races he took part in during the games bar one. After performing well in the heats of the 400&nbsp;m freestyle, he finished second in the semi-final to Austrian [[Otto Scheff]], who won the same event in the 1906 Intercalated Games. However, in the final Taylor finished 10&nbsp;seconds ahead of the Austrian who managed to win the bronze. The British press hailed Taylor as "Britain's Greatest Amateur Swimmer".<ref name="BBC"/> He was the first man to hold the world record for the 1500 metres freestyle, a feat that he completed on 25 July, 1908 in a time of 22:48.4 in London, United Kingdom. His haul of three was the most gold medals won by any Briton at the Olympics. This feat would not be repeated by any British participant in the Olympic Games for a century, when Chris Hoy won three gold medals in the [[Cycling at the 2008 Summer Olympics|cycling]] events at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing.<ref name="BBC"/>

Four years later, Taylor was selected to go to [[Stockholm]] for the [[1912 Summer Olympics]]. In the 4<U+00D7>200&nbsp;m freestyle relay, he helped his team win bronze.<ref name="BBC"/> There were no Olympic Games in 1916 due to the ongoing First World War. Taylor had signed up with the Royal Navy in 1914 and kept fit by swimming around the ships when his ship was anchored at [[Scapa Flow]].<ref name="Golden"/> He was present at the [[Battle of Jutland]]. A popular story tells that suring the course of the battle, the ship he was serving on, [[HMS St. Vincent (1908)|HMS ''St. Vincent'']], was sunk and that while the survivors waited for two hours to be rescued, Taylor swam around encouraging his crewmates.<ref name="BBC"/> However, this story is probably only a popular myth as HMS ''St Vincent'' was not sunk at the Battle of Jutland.<ref>Bennett (1968), p.&nbsp;195.</ref> He was later transferred to [[HMS Ramillies (07)|HMS ''Ramillies'']] where he remained until he was [[Demobilization|demobilised]].<ref name="Golden"/>

After the war, Taylor returned to swimming. He took part in the [[Morecambe Bay]] Race, winning eight times over a period of 20&nbsp;year and at one point held the record.<ref name="Chronicle"/> Taylor attempted to emulate [[Matthew Webb]] in swimming across the [[English Channel]] but failed due to bad weather.<ref>{{cite web |title=Henry<U+2019>s still our top Olympian |work=[[Oldham Evening Chronicle]] |url=http://www.oldham-chronicle.co.uk/news-features/8/news/13029/henry%E2%80%99s-still-our-top-olympian |date=19&nbsp;August 2008}} Retrieved on 29&nbsp;August 2008.</ref> He annually took on the French Champion, swimming in both the [[River Thames]] and the [[River Seine]] and winning on every occasion.<ref name="Golden"/> Taylor's last appearance in the Olympic Games was at [[Antwerp]], Belgium, in [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920]] when he once again helped the 4<U+00D7>200&nbsp;m freestyle relay team to bronze medal position.<ref name="BBC"/>

Taylor continued swimming competitively into his 40s until he retired in 1926. During his career he won over 35&nbsp;trophies and 300&nbsp;medals.<ref name="BBC"/> He suffered a setback when the [[public house]], the Nudger, he owned in [[Dobcross]] was closed down due to financial difficulties.<ref name="Golden"/> Taylor became an attendant at Chadderton Baths.<ref name="Chronicle"/> To raise money, Taylor was forced to sell most of his prizes. He died in obscurity aged&nbsp;65 on 28&nbsp;February 1951, in [[Chadderton]], [[Lancashire]], he was penniless and unmarried.<ref name="BBC"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Henry<U+2019>s record still stands |work=[[Manchester Evening News]] |url=http://www.oldhamadvertiser.co.uk/news/s/1063416_henrys_record_still_stands |date=20&nbsp;August 2008}} Retrieved on 28&nbsp;August 2008.</ref> He was cremated and his remains were scattered at [[Rochdale]] Cemetery.<ref name="BBC"/>

The trophies Taylor won were collected and displayed at Chadderton Baths temporarily.<ref name="BBC"/> In 2002, a [[blue plaque]] was unveiled at Chadderton Baths commemorating Taylor's achievements.<ref name="BBC"/> At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, [[Rebecca Adlington]] became the first British swimmer to win more than one gold medal at a single Olympic Games since Taylor won three in 1908.<ref>{{cite web |title=Olympics: 'Dame' Rebecca arises with second gold |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Will Buckley |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/17/olympics2008.rebeccaadlington |date=17&nbsp;August 2008}} Retrieved on 28&nbsp;August 2008.</ref>
