Born on the [[Canary Islands]] and raised in [[Madrid]], Baena came to the United States to attend the [[University of San Francisco]] and the [[Academy of Art University]].

Four months later, he returned to [[San Francisco]] to work on spots and short films at [[Click 3X]] and [[WildBrain]], Inc. Working on commercials and short films helped him secure a position at [[San Rafael]], CA.-based [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) in March 2001. At (ILM), Baena worked as an animator on ''[[Jurassic Park III]]'', ''[[Men in Black II]]'', and ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]''.
