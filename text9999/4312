'''Qwest Field''' (pronounced {{IPA-en|<U+02C8>kw<U+025B>st|}}) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Seattle]], Washington, United States. It serves as the home field for the [[Seattle Seahawks]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and [[Seattle Sounders FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS). It was originally called '''Seahawks Stadium''' but was renamed in June 2004 when the telecommunications carrier [[Qwest]] acquired naming rights. The complex also includes the Event Center with the WaMu Theater, a parking garage, and a public [[plaza]]. The venue hosts concerts, trade shows, and consumer shows along with sporting events. Located within a mile&nbsp;(1.6&nbsp;km) of Seattle's central business district, the venue is accessible by multiple freeways and forms of mass transit.

The stadium was built between 2000 and 2002 after voters approved funding for the construction in a statewide election held on June 17, 1997. This vote created the [[Washington State Public Stadium Authority]] to oversee public ownership of the venue. The owner of the Seahawks, [[Paul Allen]], formed First & Goal Inc. to develop and operate the new facilities. Allen was closely involved in the design process and emphasized the importance of an open-air venue with an intimate atmosphere. The stadium is a modern facility with views of the nearby Seattle area. The stadium can seat 67,000&nbsp;people. 

The crowd at Qwest Field is notoriously loud during Seahawks games.  The noise has contributed to the team's [[Home advantage|home field advantage]] with an increase in [[false start]] (movement by an offensive player prior to the play) penalties against visiting teams.<ref name='NY Times 2006-09-24'>{{cite news | first=John | last=Branch | title=For N.F.L., Crowd Noise Is a Headache  | date=September 9, 2004| url =http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/sports/football/24noise.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1 | work = The New York Times | page =1|accessdate=November 14, 2009}}</ref> The stadium was the first in the NFL to implement a [[FieldTurf]] [[artificial turf|artificial field]]. Numerous college and high school [[American football]] games have also been played at the stadium.

Qwest Field was also designed for [[Association football|soccer]]; the first sporting event held was a [[United Soccer Leagues|United Soccer Leagues (USL)]] [[Seattle Sounders (USL)|Seattle Sounders]] match. The USL team began regularly using the stadium for home games in 2003. The local [[Expansion of Major League Soccer|MLS expansion]] team, Seattle Sounders FC, began its inaugural season in 2009 at the stadium. Qwest Field was the site of the [[MLS Cup 2009|MLS Cup]] in 2009.

==Funding==
The Seahawks played their home games at the [[Kingdome]] from their inaugural season between the [[1976 Seattle Seahawks season|1976]] and [[1999 Seattle Seahawks season|1999 season]]s.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.seattlepi.com/kingdome/hawks.shtml |title = A month of Sundays with the Hawks |author = Clare Farnsworth |newspaper = Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date = March 27, 2000 |accessdate = 23 December 2009}}</ref> In 1995, a proposal was made to issue [[King County, Washington|county]] [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] to fund a remodeling project of the facility. The proposal failed, and as a result, Seahawks' owner [[Ken Behring]] threatened to sell or move the team. In 1997, local billionaire Paul Allen pledged to acquire the team if a new stadium could be built and said that the team could not be profitable until they left the Kingdome. He asked the [[Washington State Legislature|state legislature]] to hold a special statewide [[referendum]] on a proposal to finance a new stadium.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970607&slug=2543328 |title = Stadium `Not A Good Deal' <U+2013> Hawks To Lose Money Until New Facility Is Open |author = David Schaefer |newspaper = Seattle Times |date = June 7, 1997 |accessdate = 23 December 2009}}</ref><ref name="Funding">{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=3582|title=Washington state voters approve funding for new Seahawks Stadium on June 17, 1997|publisher=HistoryLink.org |accessdate=September 27, 2009}}</ref> With Allen agreeing to pay the $4&nbsp;million cost, the legislature agreed.

Voter approval of the referendum created a public<U+2013>private partnership.<ref name="ESPN 2007-11-13"/> The [[Washington State Public Stadium Authority]] was created to oversee public ownership of the stadium, exhibition center, and parking garage complex. Allen purchased the Seahawks and formed First & Goal Inc. to build and operate the facility. The budget for the project was $430&nbsp;million. Of this cost, $44&nbsp;million was allotted to build the Event Center, $26&nbsp;million for the parking garage, and $360&nbsp;million for the stadium. First & Goal was to pay up to $130&nbsp;million of the project while the contribution from the public was capped at $360&nbsp;million.<ref name='King County 2008-07-15'/> [[File:Qwest Field north.jpg|thumb|260px|left|alt=A gate in front of stairs leading into a stadium.

In September 1998, First & Goal signed a 30-year stadium lease that includes [[Option (finance)|options]] to extend for another 20.<ref name="Seattle Times 1998-09-25"/> Per the agreement, the Public Stadium Authority receives $850,000 a year (adjusted for inflation), and First & Goal keeps all revenue from the stadium and parking garage. The company receives 80% of the revenue from the exhibition center while the other twenty&nbsp;percent is allotted to a state education fund. First & Goal is responsible for all operating and maintenance costs, expected to be $6&nbsp;million a year, and must keep the facility in "first-class" condition. Other details of the lease include the availability of affordable seats, a coordinated effort with neighboring [[Safeco Field]] to prevent [[gridlock]], a provision for naming rights, the investment in public art at the stadium, and the giveaway of a [[luxury suite]] to a fan each Seahawks' game.<ref name="Seattle Times 1998-09-25">{{cite news| url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19980925&slug=2774038|title=Seahawks Sign Lease For 30 Years At New Stadium| last=Dudley|first=Brier| date=September 25, 1998|work=The Seattle Times| accessdate=September 9, 2009}}</ref>

Qwest Field is bordered by the [[Pioneer Square, Seattle|Pioneer Square]], [[International District, Seattle|International District]], and [[Industrial District, Seattle|Industrial District]] neighborhoods of Seattle. The stadium's referendum approval required a transportation management program to coordinate transportation options. First & Goal's facility lease agreement also included a provision to ease gridlock.<ref name="Seattle Times 1998-09-25"/> A <U+201C>Dual Event Agreement<U+201D> with Safeco Field was established so that two events with a combined attendance of over 58,000 would not occur within four hours of each other.<ref name="Transportation Plan">{{cite web|url=http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/mitig_traf_cong/seahawks_case.htm|title=Mitigating Traffic Congestion <U+2013> The Role of Demand Side Strategy Seahawks Stadium (Qwest Field) <U+2013> Seattle WA|publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration|accessdate=September 27, 2009}}</ref> The agreement was also implemented to coordinate mass transit to the stadiums on game days. Local and regional buses service the area with stops within three blocks of the stadium, and the county's [[King County Metro|Metro]] bus service offers express routes from several area [[park and ride#Bus park and rides|park and ride lots]] for games. Trains service the stadium through Seattle's [[King Street Station (Seattle)|King Street Station]] and overflow tracks accommodate extra trains during events.<ref name=' Seattle Times 2009-06-01'>{{cite news | first=Mike | last=Lindblom | title=Sports fans to find relief at Stadium light-rail stop | date=June 1, 2009 | url =http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2009284443_ststadium01m.html | work = The Seattle Times | accessdate=July 3, 2009 }}</ref> [[Sounder commuter rail|Regional commuter trains]] operate on Sundays if the Seahawks have a home game.

Qwest Field is bordered by the junction of Interstates [[Interstate 5 in Washington|5]] and [[Interstate 90 in Washington|90]] to the east and [[Washington State Route 99|State Route 99]] to its west. The [[Washington State Route 519|State Route 519]] corridor connects I-90 to the neighborhood. Local governments compromised with both the Seahawks and Mariners on the location of new ramps over the train tracks that run along the east sides of Qwest and Safeco Fields. An overpass will be built for S Royal Brougham Way, the road that borders the south edge of the Qwest Field complex, to improve access and safety. The project is scheduled for completion in June 2010.<ref name='MYNorthwest.com 2009-04-19'>{{cite web|url=http://www.mynorthwest.com/?nid=11&sid=155416 |title=Expect construction delays for Mariners Opening Day  | accessdate=April 30, 2009 |last=Haeck |first=Tim |date=April 19, 2009 |publisher=KIRO Radio }}</ref> The stadium has 2,000 parking spaces in its parking garage and 8,400 in the surrounding lots to accommodate automobile traffic.
