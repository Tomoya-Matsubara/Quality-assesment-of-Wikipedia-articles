'''Crook Peak to Shute Shelve Hill''' ({{gbmapping|ST385555}}) to ({{gbmapping|ST430560}}) is a 332.2 [[hectare]] (820.9&nbsp;acre) [[Geological Site of Special Scientific Interest|geological]] and [[biological Site of Special Scientific Interest]] near the western end of the [[Mendip Hills]], [[Somerset]], [[SSSI notification|notified]] in 1952. The line of hills runs for approximately {{convert|5|km}} from west to east and includes: '''Crook Peak''', '''Compton Hill''', '''Wavering Down''', '''Cross Plain''' and '''Shute Shelve Hill'''. Most of the site is owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] who bought {{convert|725|acre}} in 1985,<ref>{{cite news|title=Trust fundraising push reached new heights|url=http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Trust-fundraising-push-reached-new-heights/story-12334854-detail/story.html|accessdate=26 April 2015|work=Western Daily Press|date=9 September 2010}}</ref> and much of it has been designated as [[Common land]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Crooks Peak and Compton Bishop Hill|url=http://common-land.com/lands/view/2468|publisher=Common Land in England|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref>

The ecology of the area includes [[ancient woodland]] and [[calcareous grassland]] which supports nationally rare species including the [[Dianthus gratianopolitanus|Cheddar Pink]]. The underlying rocks are [[Carboniferous Limestone]] containing [[phreatic]] caves at [[Shute Shelve Cavern]] and [[Picken's Hole]] from which fossils dating from the [[Last glacial period|Middle Devensian]] have been recovered.

== Description ==

The site extends for some {{convert|5|km}} from west to east. Near its eastern end it is divided by a gap used by the [[A38 road]] and the disused [[Cheddar Valley Line|Cheddar Valley railway line]]. At the western end of the hills, closest to the [[M5 motorway]] is Crook Peak which reaches {{convert|191|m|ft}}, and forms a prominent feature from the surrounding landscape.<ref>{{cite web|title=Crook Peak|url=http://www.goodrunguide.co.uk/RecommendedRoutes/2641|publisher=Good run guide|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Crook Peak|url=http://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/crag.php?id=17490|publisher=UK Climbing|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref> Evidence of early human occupation of Crook Peak includes a polished [[flint]] [[axe]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Winscombe Parish&nbsp;<U+2014> A more detailed history.

Compton Hill is above the village of [[Compton Bishop]].

A long-distance footpath, the [[Mendip Way]], follows much of the northern boundary of the site. There is a also a {{convert|165|m}} long tunnel which was part of the [[Cheddar Valley Line]] but is now used for pedestrians and cyclists.<ref>{{cite web|title=Exploring the Strawberry Line|url=http://www.thestrawberryline.org.uk/index.php?section=visit|publisher=Strawberry Line|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref> Within the tunnel the central surface has been paved with tarmac but it is unlit except for a central guide line of small guide lamps. The north half of the tunnel is brick lined, but about midway it reverts to unlined rock for the southern half, marking a change in the underlying geology from sandstone to limestone.<ref>{{cite web|title=Exploring the Strawberry Line|url=http://www.thestrawberryline.org.uk/index.php?section=visit|publisher=The Strawberry Line|accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Crook Peak has been important as a landmark and boundary from very early times, and the origins of the name are unclear. Some believe the name 'Crook' comes from Old British 'Cruc' meaning 'peak' or 'pointed hill'.<ref>{{cite web | title=Winscombe Parish | url=http://www.winscombeandsandfordpc.org.uk/wpchistory.php | accessdate=7 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Not a soul in the West Mendips | work=Times Online | url=http://travel.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,20489-2100264,00.html | accessdate=18 July 2006 | location=London | date=25 March 2006}}</ref> 'Shute' is a contraction of ''schute'' which meant slope in the [[Middle Ages]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Costen|first1=Michael D.|last2=Aston|first2=Mick A.|title=An early medieval secular and ecclesiastical estate: the origins of the parish of Winscombe, North Somerset.|journal=Somerset Archaeology and Natural History|date=2008|volume=151|pages=139<U+2013>158|url=http://www.sanhs.org/Documents/151/AstonCosten.pdf}}</ref>

[[Image:KingsWoodSomerset.jpg|thumb|King's Wood between Cross Plain and Shute Shelve Hill]]
This ecology of the site is varied. There are ancient and secondary semi-natural [[Ancient woodland|broadleaved woodland]], however the majority is unimproved [[calcareous grassland]] with calcareous grassland and [[acidic]] dry dwarf-shrub heath.<ref>{{cite web|title=Landscape Assessment of the Mendip Hills|url=http://www.mendip.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=1882&p=0|publisher=Mendip AONB|accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref> Four of the calcareous
grassland communities and two of the woodland types have a restricted distribution in Britain, as does the calcareous grassland/acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath. These support species, four of which are considered nationally rare while seven of the plant species present are considered notable. Plants of interest include the nationally rare [[Cheddar Pink]] (''Dianthus gratianopolitanus''), [[Bedstraw]] (''Galium fleurotii''), [[Carex humilis|Dwarf Sedge]] (''Carex humilis'') and [[Dwarf Mouse-ear]] (''Cerastium pumilum''). Rose Wood and King's Wood are ancient woodland sites. King's Wood has [[Coppicing|coppiced]] [[hazel]] and nationally important [[Tilia cordata|small leaved lime]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Village Design Statement The Parish of Compton Bishop|url=http://s3.spanglefish.com/s/2829/documents/village%20design%20statement/vdsapril2003v12.pdf|publisher=Compton Bishop|accessdate=26 April 2015|page=3}}</ref> The nationally rare [[Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum|Purple Gromwell]] (''Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum'') occurs at Rose Wood.<ref name="englishnature">{{cite web | title=Crook Peak to Shute Shelve Hill | work=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1001580.pdf | accessdate=17 July 2006}}</ref>

== Geological ==
Shute Shelve Hill, which is formed of [[Carboniferous Limestone]] laid down in the [[Dinantian]] period about 350 million years ago, rises to {{convert|233|m}} above sea level. It is an [[anticline]] with younger limestones on the lower slopes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Haslett|first=Simon K.|title=Somerset Landscapes: Geology and landforms|year=2010|publisher=Blackbarn Books|location=Usk|isbn=9781456416317|pages=38<U+2013>41}}</ref> [[Black Rock Limestone]] is exposed at several sites but is commonly covered by [[Burrington Oolite]].<ref name=bgs>{{cite web|title=Crook Peak and Axbridge|url=https://www.bgs.ac.uk/mendips/localities/crookpeak.html|publisher=British Geological Survey|accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref>

[[Picken's Hole]] at the southern end of Crook Peak is considered to be of importance because of its clear, well-stratified sequence of deposits and faunas, all dating from within the [[Wisconsin glaciation|Devensian]]. The cave is {{convert|8|m}} below the plateau and {{convert|27|m}} above the valley floor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Picken's Hole (Scragg's Hole), near White Rock, Compton Bishop|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=10459|website=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref> It is named after M.J.
