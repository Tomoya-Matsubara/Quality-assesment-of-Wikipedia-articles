'''''Alexander's Ragtime Band''''' ([[1938 in film|1938]]) is a film, released by [[Twentieth Century Fox]], that takes off from the [[1911]] [[Irving Berlin]] song "[[Alexander's Ragtime Band]]", to tell a story of a society boy who scandalizes his family by pursuing a career in [[ragtime]] instead of in "serious" music.  It stars [[Tyrone Power]], [[Alice Faye]], [[Don Ameche]], [[Ethel Merman]], [[Jack Haley]], and [[Jean Hersholt]].

The story was written by Berlin himself, with [[Kathryn Scola]], [[Richard Sherman]], and [[Lamar Trotti]]. It was directed by [[Henry King]].

==Songs==

The story strings together 28 [[Irving Berlin]] songs. Old songs were combined with new ones written especially for the film, as Berlin was also to do with the motion pictures ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'', ''[[Blue Skies (film)|Blue Skies]]'', and ''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]''. ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'' was released in [[1938]], but was set in the World War I era ([[1914]] - [[1918]]).  As a result, there were some anomalies; for example, "[[Heat Wave (song)|Heat Wave]]", sung by [[Ethel Merman]], and "[[Easter Parade (song)|Easter Parade]]" were not written until [[1933]].

==Reception==
[[Alfred Newman]] won an Academy Award for Best Music, Scoring. The film was also nominated for:
*[[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]
*[[Academy Award for Best Story|Story]] - Irving Berlin
*[[Academy Award for Best Song|Song]] - Irving Berlin for "Now It Can Be Told"
*[[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Art Direction]] - Bernard Herzbrun and Boris Leven
*[[Academy Award for Film Editing|Film Editing]] - Barbara McLean
