The '''14th Battalion''', also known as the '''Pahran Regiment''', was an infantry battalion originally raised in 1914 as part of the [[First Australian Imperial Force|1st AIF]] for service in [[World War I]]. The Battalion served at Gallipoli initially before being sent to France where it served in the trenches along the [[Western Front]] until the end of the war, when it was disbanded. It was raised again in 1921 as a militia or Reserve unit based in Victoria. Later, during [[World War II]] the battalion was called up for defensive duties, serving mainly in Australia and then New Guinea in that role, before being sent to New Britain late in the war where it took part briefly in the Australian containment campaign on that island before being returned to Australia in April 1945 and being disbanded later that year.

==History==
===World War I===
The 14th Battalion was first raised in Melbourne in September 1914 and formed part of the [[4th Brigade (Australia)|4th Brigade]], commanded by Colonel [[John Monash]].  The Battalion took part in the landing and subsequent campaign at [[Gallipoli]], where [[Albert Jacka]], then a lance-corporal, received the [[Victoria Cross]] for bravery during a Turkish counterattack. Following Gallipoli the battalion was transferred to the [[Western Front]] where the battalion took part in the battles of [[Battle of Pozieres|Pozieres]] in August 1916 and [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Bullecourt]] in April 1917. It helped stop the German Spring Offensive in 1918 and took part in the battle of [[Battle of Amiens|Amiens]], the single greatest success of the Allies during the war. Following the [[Armistice]] in November 1918, the battalion began to return to Australia for demobilisation. Total casualties suffered by the battalion during the war included 915 killed and 2229 wounded (including gassed).<ref name=AWM>[http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11201.asp Australian War Memorial Unit Information - 14th Battalion, AIF, (WWI)].</ref>

===Inter-war Years===
In 1921 the battalion was raised again as part of the [[Citizens Military Force]] or Militia, this time with the designation of 14th Battalion (Pahran Regiment).<ref name=AWM2>[http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11307.asp Australian War Memorial Unit Information - 14th/32nd Battalion, AMF, (WWII)].</ref>

===World War II===
Following Japan's entry into [[World War II]] after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the British in [[Malaya]],<!--Wikilink to the battle instead?--> the battalion was called up for service under the ''Defence Act''. Following this they were used mainly as garrison troops in Victoria, before being transferred to Western Australia where they became part of the [[6th Brigade (Australia)|6th Brigade]]. Whilst at Geraldton, the 14th Battalion was merged with the [[32nd Battalion (Australia)|32nd Battalion]], to become the 14th/32nd Battalion.<ref name=AWM2/> 

After this, the 14th/32nd Battalion was moved to the [[Atherton Tablelands]] in Queensland before being sent to [[New Guinea]] in July 1943, where they once again filled the role of garrison troops for almost a year. In 1944, the battalion was attached to the [[5th Division (Australia)|5th Division]] and in November the 6th Brigade carried out an amphibious landing at Jacquinot Bay on [[New Britain]]. After this the Australians undertook a campaign of containment against the much larger Japanese force, and during this time the battalion was involved in only one major battle&mdash;its first and its last of the war&mdash;when they captured Bacon Hill on 18 March 1945. They were returned to Australia in April and were disbanded in July 1945. During the war the battalion suffered 31 killed and 46 wounded.<ref name=AWM2/>
