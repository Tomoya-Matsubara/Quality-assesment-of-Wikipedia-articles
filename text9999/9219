'''Maryse Ouellet''' (born January 21, 1983)<ref name="slam"/> is a [[French Canadian]] [[Glamour photography|glamour model]] and [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], better known simply as '''Maryse'''. She is currently working for [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) on its [[WWE Raw|Raw]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]].<ref name=WWEbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/raw/maryse/bio|accessdate=2009-04-14|title=Maryse's WWE Bio|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref>

After spending years modelling, including winning [[Hawaiian Tropic#Miss Hawaiian Tropic Canada|Miss Hawaiian Tropic Canada]] in 2003, Maryse was hired by WWE in 2006, after she participated in the [[WWE Diva Search]] competition. Despite her elimination, she was sent to WWE's developmental facility, [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW) in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. She signed a deal with WWE in August 2006 and was assigned to OVW for wrestling training, where she made her ring debut in December 2006. She appeared in [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignette]]s on WWE television. During this time, she continued working at OVW, but was later transferred to [[Florida Championship Wrestling]] (FCW), another WWE developmental facility, to further her training.

In March 2008, Maryse appeared on ''SmackDown'', competing in a swim suit competition. Three months later she made her television in-ring debut. In December 2008, Maryse captured her first title with the company, the [[WWE Unified Divas Championship|WWE Divas Championship]], and would hold onto it for seven months. In April 2009 she was drafted to the Raw brand, during the [[2009 WWE Draft]]. She won the Divas Championship for the second time in February 2010, making her the first wrestler to have the championship on more than one occasion.
