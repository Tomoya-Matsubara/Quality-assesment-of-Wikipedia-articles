'''''Wii Fit''''' (currently known as '''''Wii Fitness''''' in [[Europe]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ms.nintendo-europe.com/e32007/enGB/wii_wiifit.html|title=Nintendo E3 2007 - Wii - Wii Fitness|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> is an upcoming [[video game]] for the [[Wii]] [[video game console]] currently in development by [[Nintendo]]. Codenamed '''''Wii Health Pack''''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.wii.ign.com/articles/804/804113p1.html|title=E3 2007: Feet-on Wii Fit|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=[[2007-07-12]]|accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> it was announced under its current title at Nintendo's [[E3]] [[press conference]] on [[July 11]] [[2007]], by famed [[video game designer]] [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. At Nintendo's media briefing, it was demonstrated by Shigeru Miyamoto himself, [[Reggie Fils-Aime]], and other participants. Like the rest of the [[Wii Series]], ''Wii Fit'' will integrate [[Mii]]s into its presentation and gameplay.<ref name="e32007"/> The game is designed to function with the [[Wii Balance Board]] peripheral.

==History==
''Wii Fit'' was first revealed as ''Wii Health Pack'', by Shigeru Miyamoto, during a conference in mid-September of [[2006]].<ref name="details1">{{cite web | url=http://wii.nintendo.com/iwata_asks_vol4_p1.jsp | title=Part 1 - A Truly Ground-breaking Collection of Games | author=[[Satoru Iwata]] | publisher=[[Nintendo]] | accessdate=2007-02-21}}</ref> Then described as a "way to help get families exercising together",<ref name="details1"/> the game idea had first been included in Miyamoto's original design document for the whole [[Wii Series]], the entirety of which was scribbled down on a single sheet of paper.<ref name="details1"/>

As with other games designed by Shigeru Miyamoto, such as ''[[Nintendogs]]'' and ''[[Pikmin]]'', the design of ''Wii Fit'' was influenced by the activities in Miyamoto's day to day life.<ref name="roundtable">{{cite web|first=Jeremy|last=Parish|title=Miyamoto Roundtable full transcription|date=[[2007-07-13]]|accessdate=2007-07-14|url=http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=8258756&publicUserId=5379721}}</ref> Miyamoto states that he and his family had become more health-conscious, going to the gym and tracking their weight.<ref name="roundtable"/> He found that it had become "fun over time to talk about these things",<ref name="roundtable"/> and as weighing yourself "didn't make much of a game",<ref name="roundtable"/> they decided to build games around the idea to mesh with the concept.<ref name="roundtable"/>

In an interview with ''[[Game Informer]]'' at [[E3 2007]] Miyamoto revealed that ''Wii Fit'' had been in development with a "full-scale" team for a year at the time. <ref name="GI">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200707/N07.0718.1839.37207.htm?Page=1|title=Nintendo's Busiest Man: The Shigeru Miyamoto Interview|date=[[2007-07-18]]|accessdate=2007-07-19|first=Billy|last=Berghammer|publisher=''[[Game Informer]]''}}</ref> The Wii Balance Board, however, had been worked on for "almost two years". <ref name="GI"/>

==Gameplay==
''Wii Fit'' will use a unique platform peripheral called the [[Wii Balance Board]] that can measure a user's [[body mass index]] and their center of gravity. The game will have about 40 different activities,<ref name="IGNliveblog">{{cite web | title =E3 2007: Nintendo E3 Media Briefing Live Blog | publisher =IGN | date = [[2007-07-11]] | url =http://uk.wii.ign.com/articles/803/803335p1.html | accessdate = 2007-07-11}}</ref> including yoga poses, [[Press up|press ups]], and other exercises.<ref name="e32007"/> Furthermore, ''Wii Fit'' will allow its players to compare their fitness by using ''Wii Fit''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s own channel on the [[Wii Menu]].<ref name="E3pressrelease">{{cite web|title=Upcoming Wii game release dates|publisher=GoNintendo|date=[[2007-07-11]]|url=http://gonintendo.com/?p=21101#more-21101|accessdate= 2007-07-11}}</ref>

At the moment, according to Shigeru Miyamoto when speaking to [[IGN]] during an interview at [[E3]] [[2007]], there are currently no plans to integrate any [[WiiConnect24]] functionality into ''Wii Fit''.<ref name="vid">{{cite video|people= Shigeru Miyamoto (Interviewed)|year=2007|date= July 12|title=E3 2007: Shigeru Miyamoto Video Interview|url=http://uk.media.wii.ign.com/articles/804/804464/vids_1.html|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> He did note, however, that there could be possibilities to take advantage of the WiiConnect24 in the future, such as using the service to keep in contact with a doctor to help with rehabilitation, or with a fitness specialist to help with training exercises.<ref name="vid"/>

===Activities===
Currently, only a few of the activities available for exercise in ''Wii Fit'' have been revealed.
