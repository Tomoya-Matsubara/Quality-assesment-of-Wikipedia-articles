Martin  was born in 1903 at [[Ch<U+00E2>teau Gruaud-Larose]] where his grandfather then was ''ma<U+00EE>tre de chai'' and his father Alfred Martin a cooper, the family having lived in the region for more than three centuries.<ref name=wd-g>{{Cite web|last= Kissack |first= Chris, thewinedoctor.com|title=Chateau Gloria|url=http://www.thewinedoctor.com/tastingsprofile/gloria.shtml}}</ref> 

Martin built his own estate [[Ch<U+00E2>teau Gloria]] from the ground, with no historical reputation or other advantages such as applying for the ''[[Cru bourgeois]]'' classification, although by acquiring desirable [[vineyard]]s from classed ''[[cru]]s'', to become one of Saint-Julien's best-known properties,<ref name=NYmar/> within the space of a generation.<ref name=BDP>{{cite book|last =Peppercorn |first =David |title =Bordeaux |publisher = Mitchell Beazley |date =2003 |location =London| isbn= 1840009276 |pages =119-120 }}</ref> The process began in 1942 with the purchase of {{convert|6|ha|acre|lk=on}} of vines. With the help of his father who was initially angered by the initiative, the acquisition of land grew to amass {{convert|48|ha|acre}}.<ref name=wd-stj>{{Cite web|last= Kissack |first= Chris, thewinedoctor.com|title=Bordeaux Wine Guide: St Julien |url= http://www.thewinedoctor.com/regionalguides/bordeaux7stjulien.shtml }}</ref>

Martin served as president of [[Le Conseil Interprofessionnel du Vin de Bordeaux|CIVB]] from 1956 to the mid 60s,<ref name=ALE2/> was a co-founder and leader of  the ''Commanderie de Bordeaux'',<ref name=wd-g/> and was a leading figure in ''Le Bontemps du M<U+00E9>doc''.<ref name=BDP/> He was also a vocal opponent of the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]].<ref name=wd-g/><ref name=BDP/>

In 1963, Martin was also appointed manager, along with Jean-Paul Gard<U+00E8>re, of the [[First Growth|''premier cru'']] [[Ch<U+00E2>teau Latour]] when foreign investors gained control of the estate, and Martin became a driving force of innovations in research and investments of restaurations and vineyard acquisitions as well as and replanting.<ref name=wd-cl>{{cite web|last= Kissack |first= Chris, thewinedoctor.com|title= Chateau Latour |url= http://www.thewinedoctor.com/tastingsprofile/latour.shtml }}</ref><ref name=BDP2>{{cite book|last =Peppercorn |first =David |title =Bordeaux |publisher = Mitchell Beazley |date =2003 |location =London| isbn= 1840009276 |pages =163-169 }}</ref>

With the personal ambition to own a classed growth, this was achieved in 1982 at age of 78 when Martin bought [[Ch<U+00E2>teau Saint-Pierre]], a ''quatri<U+00E8>me cru'' where his father had once worked, and set out to improve,<ref name=wd-stp>{{Cite web|last= Kissack |first= Chris, thewinedoctor.com|title=Chateau Saint-Pierre|url=http://www.thewinedoctor.com/tastingsprofile/stpierre.shtml}}</ref> with noticeable results.<ref name=BDP3>{{cite book|last =Peppercorn |first =David |title =Bordeaux |publisher = Mitchell Beazley |date =2003 |location =London| isbn= 1840009276 |pages =135-137 }}</ref> The estate is currently home to his daughter Fran<U+00E7>oise and her husband [[Jean-Louis Triaud]], current general manager of the estates under Domaines Henri Martin. Martin died in February 1991.
