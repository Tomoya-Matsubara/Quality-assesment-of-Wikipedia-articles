The '''Bristol Bus Boycott''' of 1963, arose from the refusal of the [[Bristol Omnibus Company]] to employ Black or Asian bus crews in [[Bristol]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] and area. In common with other [[United Kingdom|British]] cities there was widespread discrimination in housing and employment against "coloureds". Led by youth worker [[Paul Stephenson (civil rights campaigner)|Paul Stephenson]] and the West Indian Development Council, the [[boycott]] of the company's buses by Bristolians lasted for sixty days until the company backed down and overturned the [[Racial segregation|colour bar]]. 

The campaign was considered by some to have been influential in the passing of the Race Relations Acts of 1965 and which made "racial discrimination unlawful in public places." and the [[Race Relations Act 1968]], which extended the provisions to employment and housing.

==Background==
Bristol in the early 1960s had an estimated 3,000 residents of [[West Indian]] origin, some who had served in the armed forces during [[World War II]], some who had emigrated to Britain more recently.  A large number of them lived in the area around City Road, [[St Pauls, Bristol]]. They suffered discrimination in housing and employment and some encountered violence from [[Teddy Boy|teddy boy]] gangs of white youths.<ref>Dresser 1986, p. 10-11</ref> This community set up their own churches and associations, including the West Indian Association, which began to act as a representative body.<ref name="Dresser 1986, p. 12">Dresser 1986, p. 12</ref> 

One of their foremost grievances was the colour bar operated by the Bristol Omnibus Company, which was a [[Nationalization|nationalised]] company owned by the [[Her Majesty's Government|British Government]] since 1950, and operated through the [[Transport Holding Company]].<ref>Samuel 1989, p. 350</ref> Although there was a reported labour shortage on the buses, black prospective employees were refused work as bus crews, although they were employed in workshops and canteens. The [[Bristol Evening Post]] and the [[Western Daily Press]] both ran series on the colour bar, which was blamed by company management on the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]] (TGWU), which represented bus workers.<ref>Dresser 1986, p. 13-14</ref> Local union officials denied that there was any colour bar but in 1955 the Passenger Group of the TGWU had passed a resolution that coloured workers should not be employed as bus crews. Andrew Hake, curate of the Bristol Industrial Mission recalled that "The TGWU in the city had said that if one black man steps on the platform as a conductor, every wheel will stop."<ref name="Dresser 1986, p. 12" />

The bus workers' concern, apart from the racism which was common at that time, was that a new source of labour could reduce their earnings. Pay was low and workers relied on overtime to get a good wage. One shop steward said, "people were fearful of an influx of people from elsewhere (on the grounds it) would be reducing their earnings potential."<ref>Dresser 1986, p. 39</ref>

==Boycott==
Four young West Indian men, Roy Hackett, Owen Henry, Audley Evans and Prince Brown formed an action group, later to be called the West Indian Development Council, as they were unhappy with the lack of progress in fighting discrimination by the West Indian Association. Owen Henry had met Paul Stephenson whose father was from West Africa and who had been to college. The group decided that the articulate Stephenson would be their spokesman.<ref>Dresser 1986, p. 14-15</ref> Stephenson set up a test case to prove the colour bar existed by arranging an interview with the bus company for a young warehouseman  and [[Boys' Brigade]] officer, Guy Bailey. When Stephenson then told the company that Bailey was West Indian, the interview was cancelled.<ref>Dresser 1986, p. 17</ref> Inspired by the refusal of [[Rosa Parks]] to give up her seat on a bus in [[Alabama]] and the ensuing [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]], the activists decided on a bus boycott in Bristol.<ref>

Their action was announced at a press conference and they lobbied Bristol [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] [[Stan Awbery]] and [[Tony Benn]]. When reporters questioned the bus company about the boycott, the general manager, Ian Patey, "said today the company's policy regarding coloured labour had been clear for years and the action by the West Indians would not make them reconsider their policy. We don't employ a mixed labour force as bus crews because we have found from observing other bus companies that the labour supply gets worse if the labour force is mixed."<ref>Dresser 1986, p. 20</ref><ref>

The local branch of the TGWU refused to meet with a delegation from the West Indian Development Council, and an increasingly bitter war of words was fought out in the local media. Ron Nethercott, South West Regional Secretary of the union launched an attack on Stephenson in the [[Daily Herald]] newspaper, calling him "dishonest" and "irresponsible".  This led to a libel case in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], which awarded Stephenson damages and costs.<ref>

</ref>  The Bristol Council of Churches launched a mediation attempt, saying <blockquote>
We seriously regret that what may prove an extended racial conflict arising from this issue has apparently been deliberately created by a small group of West Indians professing to be representative. We also deplore the apparent fact that social and economic fears on the part of some white people should have placed the Bristol Bus Company in a position where it is most difficult to fulfil the Christian ideal of race relations.<ref>{{cite news

This in turn was criticised by Robert Davison, an official at the [[Jamaican High Commission]], who stated that it was "nonsense to describe a group of West Indians as unrepresentative when no representative West Indian body existed."<ref>{{cite news
