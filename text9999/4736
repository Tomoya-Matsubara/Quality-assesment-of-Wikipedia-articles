"'''The Son Also Draws'''" is the sixth episode of the [[Family Guy (season 1)|first season]] of the [[Animated cartoon|animated]] [[Television comedy|comedy series]] ''[[Family Guy]]''. It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on May&nbsp;9,&nbsp;1999. The episode follows [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] as he is ejected from the Youth Scouts, and his father [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] drives the family to Scout headquarters to get him readmitted. During a rest stop at a Native American casino, [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] gambles away the family car, and Peter pretends to be a member of the tribe in an attempt to get it back. When he is sent on a vision quest to prove his heritage Chris accompanies him to explain that he does not like the Scouts, and prefers drawing. Delirious from hunger, Peter has a vision of his spiritual guide [[Fonzie]] and on his advice finally listens to Chris. Reconciled, the pair return to the casino and reclaim the car.

"The Son Also Draws" was written by [[Ricky Blitt]] and directed by [[Neil Affleck]], both working on their first ''Family Guy'' episode. The episode guest starred actors [[Suzie Plakson]], [[Kevin Michael Richardson]], [[Fred Tatasciore]] and [[Wally Wingert]]. Recurring guest voice actors included writer and animator [[Butch Hartman]] and actor [[Patrick Bristow]]. Much of the episode's humor is structured around [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway]] sequences that parody popular culture, including references to ''[[Happy Days]]'', ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'', ''[[One Day at a Time]]'', and ''[[The More You Know]]''.

Critical reception for the episode was positive; certain critics believed the episode was not an "instant classic" in contrast to the the other episodes of the season but called it "memorable" and "brilliant" nevertheless, while others regarded it as the black sheep of the season. The episode caused controversy in Canada for the episode's final gag, in which Peter states that "Canada sucks."

==Plot==
[[Chris Griffin]], the family's teenage son, hates being in the "Youth Scouts" (''Family Guy''{{'}}s version of the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]]) and wants to quit, but is afraid to tell his father [[Peter Griffin|Peter]]. Chris is finally kicked out when he runs over the [[Scout Leader|troop leader]] during a [[Soap Box Derby]]. Peter insists on driving Chris and the rest of the family (Peter's wife [[Lois Griffin|Lois]], their daughter [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] and their infant [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] ) to the Youth Scout headquarters, in [[Manhattan]], to get Chris readmitted. While they are gone, their talking dog [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] is unable to switch the TV channel or turn the TV off, and his intelligence drops sharply after watching daytime programming.

The family stops at a [[Native American gaming|Native American casino]] as Peter needs to use the bathroom, Lois quickly becomes [[Problem gambling|addicted to gambling]] and loses the family car. After hearing that Lois has gambled the car away, Peter tries to get it back by claiming to be Native American. The doubtful Indian [[American Indian elder|elder]]s demand that he go on a [[vision quest]] to prove his heritage. Chris accompanies Peter into the wilderness, hoping to tell him that he only wants to draw instead of being in the Scouts. Delirious from hunger, Peter begins talking to [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] trees and sees a vision of his spiritual guide, [[Fonzie]]. After hearing Fonzie's advice Peter finally listens to Chris's complaints and realizes his son is a talented artist. They return to the casino and reclaim their car. The episode ends with Lois, Stewie, and Meg counteracting stereotypes about Native Americans, Mexicans, and Swedes, respectively, before Peter comments that "[[Canada]] sucks."

==Reception==
Reviews for "The Son Also Draws" were mixed to favorable. In his 2008 review, Ahsan Haque of [[IGN]] rated the episode an 8/10, stating that while the episode is not an "instant classic", it is "still quite strong" and has "more than a few clever moments". He also notes that the cutaways are "kept to a minimum", and much of the humor comes from the storyline. He commented that the episode did not have as much laugh-out-loud moments as other episodes, but stated that it had bolder humor than the show would later be known for.<ref name=ign>{{cite web| author = Haque, Ahsan | title = Family Guy: "The Son Also Draws" Review | publisher = [[IGN]] | url = http://tv.ign.com/articles/883/883786p1.html| accessdate=2009-12-01}}</ref> In his review of the first volume DVD collection of ''Family Guy'', Aaron Beierle of [[DVD Talk]] listed "The Son Also Draws" as one of the series' "most brilliant moments", praising the spiritual vision sequence and naming the conversation between Peter and Brian among the best moments of the series, calling the conversation "rolling-on-the-floor funny."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/5879/family-guy-volume-1/|title=Family Guy Volume 1|work=[[DVD Talk]]|author=Aaron Beierle |date=2003-03-21|accessdate=2010-08-10}}</ref>
