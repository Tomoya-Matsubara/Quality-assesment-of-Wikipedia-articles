The '''Uruguay-Argentina 2030 FIFA World Cup''' is a joint bid by Uruguay and Argentina to host the [[2030 FIFA World Cup]]. The bid followed an earlier web movement claiming that [[FIFA]] should give Uruguay hosting rights for the 100th anniversary of the first [[1930 FIFA World Cup]] which was also held in Uruguay. FIFA is set to vote on the host nation of the 2030 edition in 2015.<ref>[http://depor.pe/futbol-internacional/905644/noticia-argentina-y-uruguay-se-unen-organizar-mundial-futbol-2030]</ref><ref>[http://www.telesurtv.net/articulos/2013/04/23/uruguay-y-argentina-crean-comision-para-proponer-sede-compartida-para-el-mundial-2030-de-futbol-4547.html]</ref>

==Background==
The project originally was the idea of [[Abel Fialko]],<ref name="La Republica, 25 October 2007">[http://www.larepublica.com.uy/deportes/281043-el-padre-de-uruguay-2030-tiene-44-anos-y-vive-en-israel La Republica, 25 October 2007]</ref> an Uruguayan resident in Israel.

[[Athens]], the capital of Greece, the home of the ancient and first modern [[1896 Summer Olympics]], was considered by many observers during the [[Bids for the 1996 Summer Olympics]] period as "the natural choice" for the Centennial Olympic Games of 1996. However, in the end, the U.S. city of [[Atlanta]] was selected, in a greatly controversial vote, to host the [[Centennial Olympics]].

Because of that incident, Fialko had a real concern that Uruguay's "historical rights" to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup (because Uruguay hosted the first edition of that tournament) wouldn't be enough, and that Uruguay would end up having the same fate as Athens.<ref name="La Republica, 25 October 2007"/>

Abel Fialko then launched a website<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20040321163237/http://www.uruguay2030.org/ Uruguay 2030 former Website]</ref> in 1997 and began gathering more and more people, using the internet, to his cause.<ref>[http://www.insideworldfootball.biz/worldfootball/southamerica/7505-joint-uruguay-and-argentina-2030-bid-given-go-ahead Inside World Football, 25 November 2009]</ref>

Using the benefits of the Internet to his advantage, and realizing that through it, the World was literally a [[Global village (term)|global village]], Fialko managed to bring upon himself the attention of many of his countrymen.
Soon the world media learned of the initiative and Fialko was awarded with several interviews.<ref name="quinto">{{Citation |last = |first = |title = <U+00A1>Uruguay 2030! |newspaper = Revista Quinto Dia |date = May 15, 1998 |url = http://i853.photobucket.com/albums/ab94/DanielFialko/15quinto.jpg}}</ref><ref name="observador">{{Citation |last = Caballero |first = Soledad |title = El Mundial de 2030 en Uruguay |newspaper = El Observador |date = June 9, 1998 |url = http://i853.photobucket.com/albums/ab94/DanielFialko/Observador.jpg}}</ref><ref name="guambia">{{Citation |last = Cabrera |first = Sebastian |title = Volver al Futuro |newspaper = Revista Guambia |date = July 8, 1998 |url = http://i853.photobucket.com/albums/ab94/DanielFialko/Guambia.jpg }}</ref><ref name="france">{{Citation |last = Chantal |first = Sylvain |title = Uruguay 2030,un r<U+00E8>ve romantique |newspaper = France Football |date = July 25, 2001 |url = http://i853.photobucket.com/albums/ab94/DanielFialko/Ff.jpg }}</ref>

On Tuesday 4 October, during his visit to Uruguay to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the inaugural FIFA World Cup, [[FIFA]] President [[Sepp Blatter]] had a meeting with the Uruguayan President [[Tabar<U+00E9> V<U+00E1>zquez]]. In that Meeting V<U+00E1>zquez formally suggested that Uruguay could co-host the 2030 FIFA World Cup with another MERCOSUR nation to commemorate the centenary of Uruguay 1930.

After the meeting, Sepp Blatter stated, "During our meeting, the President told me of his dream of seeing this tournament hosted in the region. I told him that today's dream could be tomorrow's vision, which in turn could become a proper initiative and finally a project. At present, the South American Football Confederation is scheduled to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and all (national) associations will be able to present their candidature when we begin the selection process at the end of 2006. Dr Nicholas Leoz tells me that with the system of rotation it will be the turn of South America in 2030. That is the situation as it currently stands.".<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/president/news/newsid=100816.html FIFA official website, 11 October 2005]</ref>

===Uruguay-Argentina joint bid===
In October 2007, [[Julio Grondona]], President of the [[Argentine Football Association]], accepted a proposal from neighboring Uruguay to bid to co-host the 2030 World Cup. Grondona said in the formal response letter to the Uruguayan football authorities:"the Argentine Football Association Executive Committee, at its yesterday meeting, unanimously approved applying for your initiative to jointly organize the FIFA World Championship 2030. Undoubtedly, to crystallize this purpose will lead to further deepen the friendly ties that forever bind the two countries, and hence sports and government officials on both sides of the Rio de la Plata will work together in order to meet the final goal of 2030 World Cup."<ref>[http://www.larepublica.com.uy/deportes/280277-afa-aprobo-la-iniciativa-de-auf-de-organizar-mundial-de-2030 La Republica, 19 October 2007]</ref>

In that same month, during a meeting of the [[CONMEBOL]] (South American Football Confederation), Uruguay received the support of other South American countries to co-host the 2030 World Cup football finals with Argentina.<ref>[http://www.terra.com/deportes/articulo/html/fox468196.htm Terra/EFE, 19 October 2007]</ref>
