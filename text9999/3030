'''Diatoms''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''{{polytonic|<U+03B4><U+03B9><U+03AC>}} (dia)'' = "through" +  ''{{polytonic|<U+03C4><U+03AD><U+03BC><U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03BD>}} (temnein)'' = "to cut", i.e., "cut in half") are a major group of [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[alga]]e, and are one of the most common types of [[phytoplankton]]. Most diatoms are [[unicellular]], although they can exist as [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] in the shape of filaments or ribbons (e.g. ''Fragillaria''), fans (''Meridion''), zigzags (''[[Tabellaria]]''), or stellate colonies (''[[Asterionella]]'').  A characteristic feature of diatom cells is that they are encased within a unique cell wall made of [[silica]] (hydrated silicon dioxide) called a [[frustule]]. These frustules show a wide diversity in form, some quite beautiful and ornate, but usually consist of two asymmetrical sides with a split between them, hence the group name. [[Fossil]] evidence suggests that they originated during, or before, the early [[Jurassic]] [[Period (geology)|Period]].  Diatom communities are a popular tool for monitoring environmental conditions, past and present, and are commonly used in studies of water quality.

==General biology==<!-- This section is linked from [[Frustule]] -->
There are more than 200 [[genus|genera]] of living diatoms, and it is estimated that there are approximately 100,000 [[Extant taxon|extant]] [[species]]<ref name=round90>Round, F. E. and Crawford, R. M. (1990).  ''The Diatoms.  Biology and Morphology of the Genera'', Cambridge University Press, UK.</ref><ref name="Lund95">Canter-Lund, H. and Lund, J.W.G. (1995). ''Freshwater Algae'', Biopress Limited. ISBN 0 948737 25 5.</ref>.  Diatoms are a widespread group and can be found in the [[ocean]]s, in [[freshwater]], in [[soil]]s and on damp surfaces.  Most live [[pelagic]]ally in open water, although some live as surface films at the water-sediment interface ([[benthos|benthic]]), or even under damp atmospheric conditions.  They are especially important in oceans, where they are estimated to contribute up to 45% of the total oceanic [[primary production]]<ref name=mann99>Mann, D. G. (1999).  [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n307k3757002213t/ The species concept in diatoms].  ''Phycologia'' '''38''', 437-495.</ref>.  Although usually [[microscope|microscopic]], some species of diatoms can reach up to 2 [[millimetre]]s in length.

Diatoms belong to a large group called the [[heterokont]]s, including both [[autotroph]]s (e.g. [[golden alga]]e, [[kelp]]) and [[heterotroph]]s (e.g. [[water mould]]s).  Their yellowish-brown [[chloroplast]]s are typical of heterokonts, with four [[plasma membrane|membranes]] and containing [[biological pigment|pigments]] such as [[fucoxanthin]].  Individuals usually lack [[flagellum|flagella]], but they are present in [[gamete]]s and have the usual heterokont structure, except they lack the hairs (mastigonemes) characteristic in other groups.  Most diatoms are non-motile, although some move via flagellation.  As their relatively dense cell walls cause them to readily sink, planktonic forms in open water usually rely on [[turbulence|turbulent]] mixing of the upper layers by the [[wind]] to keep them suspended in sunlit surface waters.  Some species actively regulate their buoyancy with intracellular [[lipid]]s to counter sinking.

Diatoms cells are contained within a unique silicate ([[silicic acid]]) [[cell wall]] comprising two separate valves (or shells).  The biogenic silica that the cell wall is composed of is synthesised [[intracellular]]ly by the [[polymerisation]] of silicic acid [[monomer]]s.  This material is then extruded to the cell exterior and added to the wall.  Diatom cell walls are also called '''[[frustules]]''' or '''tests''', and their two valves typically overlap one other like the two halves of a [[petri dish]].  In most species, when a diatom divides to produce two daughter cells, each cell keeps one of the two valves and grows a smaller valve within it.  As a result, after each division cycle the average size of diatom cells in the population gets smaller.  Once such cells reach a certain minimum size, rather than simply divide [[vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]], they reverse this decline by forming an [[auxospore]].  This expands in size to give rise to a much larger cell, which then returns to size-diminishing divisions.  Auxospore production is almost always linked to [[meiosis]] and sexual reproduction.

Decomposition and decay of diatoms leads to [[organic matter|organic]] and [[inorganic]] (in the form of [[silicate]]s) sediment, the inorganic component of which can lead to a method of analyzing past marine environments by corings of ocean floors or [[bay mud]]s, since the inorganic matter is embedded in deposition of [[clay]]s and [[silt]]s and forms a permanent [[geological]] record of such marine strata.

==Classification==
[[Image:Diatomeas-Haeckel.jpg|thumb|right|Selections from [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s 1904 ''Kunstformen der Natur'' (Artforms of Nature), showing pennate (left) and centric (right) frustules.]]

The classification of heterokonts is still unsettled, and they may be treated as a [[Division (biology)|division]] (or [[Phylum (biology)|phylum]]), [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], or something in-between.  Accordingly, groups like the diatoms may be ranked anywhere from class (usually called '''Bacillariophyceae''') to division (usually called '''Bacillariophyta'''), with corresponding changes in the ranks of their subgroups.  The diatoms are also sometimes referred to as '''Class Diatomophyceae'''.

Diatoms are traditionally divided into two [[Order (biology)|orders]]: '''centric''' diatoms ([[Centrales]]), which are radially [[symmetry|symmetric]], and '''pennate''' diatoms ([[Pennales]]), which are bilaterally symmetric.  The former are [[paraphyletic]] to the latter.  A more recent classification<ref name=round90/> divides the diatoms into three classes: centric diatoms ([[Coscinodiscophyceae]]), pennate diatoms without a [[raphe]] ([[Fragilariophyceae]]), and pennate diatoms with a raphe ([[Bacillariophyceae]]).  It is probable there will be further revisions as understanding of their relationships increases.

==Ecology ==
[[Image:Oceanic Silicon Cycle Budget.svg|thumb|right|A budget of the ocean's silicon cycle<ref name=treg95>Treguer, P., Nelson, D. M., Van Bennekom, A. J., DeMaster, D. J., Leynaert, A. and Queguiner, B. (1995).  [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/268/5209/375 The silica balance in the world ocean : A reestimate].  ''Science'' '''268''', 375-379.</ref>]]

[[Plankton]]ic forms in freshwater and marine environments typically exhibit a "[[boom and bust]]" (or "'''bloom''' and bust") lifestyle.  When conditions in the upper mixed layer (nutrients and light) are favourable (''e.g.'' at the start of spring) their competitive edge<ref name=furnas90>Furnas, M. J. (1990).  [http://plankt.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/6/1117 ''In situ'' growth rates of marine phytoplankton : Approaches to measurement, community and species growth rates].  ''J. Plankton Res.'' '''12''', 1117-1151.</ref> allows them to quickly dominate phytoplankton communities ("boom" or "bloom").  As such they are often classed as opportunistic [[r-selection|r-strategists]] (''i.e.'' those organisms whose ecology is defined by a high growth rate, ''r'').

When conditions turn unfavourable, usually upon depletion of nutrients, diatom cells typically increase in sinking rate and exit the upper mixed layer ("bust").  This sinking is induced by either a loss of buoyancy control, the synthesis of [[mucilage]] that sticks diatoms cells together, or the production of heavy '''resting spores'''.   Sinking out of the upper mixed layer removes diatoms from conditions inimical to growth, including grazer populations and higher temperatures (which would otherwise increase cell [[metabolism]]).  Cells reaching deeper water or the shallow seafloor can then rest until conditions become more favourable again.  In the open ocean, many sinking cells are lost to the deep, but refuge populations can persist near the [[thermocline]].

Ultimately, diatom cells in these resting populations re-enter the upper mixed layer when vertical mixing entrains them.  In most circumstances, this mixing also replenishes nutrients in the upper mixed layer, setting the scene for the next round of diatom blooms.  In the open ocean (away from areas of continuous [[upwelling]]<ref name=dugdale98>Dugdale, R. C. and Wilkerson, F. P. (1998).  [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v391/n6664/abs/391270a0.html Silicate regulation of new production in the equatorial Pacific upwelling].  ''Nature'' '''391''', 270-273.</ref>), this cycle of bloom, bust, then return to pre-bloom conditions typically occurs over an annual cycle, with diatoms only being prevalent during the spring and early summer.  In some locations, however, an autumn bloom may occur, caused by the breakdown of summer stratification and the entrainment of nutrients while light levels are still sufficient for growth.  Since vertical mixing is increasing, and light levels are falling as winter approaches, these blooms are smaller and shorter-lived than their spring equivalents.

In the open ocean, the condition that typically causes diatom (spring) blooms to end is a lack of silicon.  Unlike other nutrients, this is only a major requirement of diatoms so it is not regenerated in the plankton ecosystem as efficiently as, for instance, [[nitrogen]] or [[phosphorus]] nutrients.  This can be seen in maps of surface nutrient concentrations - as nutrients decline along gradients, silicon is usually the first to be exhausted (followed normally by nitrogen then phosphorus).

Because of this bloom-and-bust lifestyle, diatoms are believed to play a disproportionately important role in the export of carbon from oceanic surface waters<ref name=smetacek85>Smetacek, V. S. (1985).  [http://www.springerlink.com/content/t5g25521p5252014/ Role of sinking in diatom life-history cycles : Ecological, evolutionary and geological significance].  ''Mar. Biol.'' '''84''', 239-251.</ref><ref name=dugdale98/> (see also the [[biological pump]]).  Significantly, they also play a key role in the regulation of the biogeochemical cycle of [[silicon]] in the modern ocean<ref name=treg95/><ref name=yool03>Yool, A. and Tyrrell, T. (2003).  [http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2003/2002GB002018.shtml Role of diatoms in regulating the ocean's silicon cycle].  ''Global Biogeochemical Cycles'' '''17''', 1103, doi:10.1029/2002GB002018.</ref>.

[[Image:Egge and Aksnes 1992 plot.svg|thumb|300px|right|Egge & Aksnes (1992)<ref name=egge92>Egge, J. K. and Aksnes, D. L. (1992).  [http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/83/m083p281.pdf Silicate as regulating nutrient in phytoplankton competition].  ''Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser.'' '''83''', 281-289.</ref> figure.]]

The use of silicon by diatoms is believed by many researchers to be the key to their ecological success.  In a now classic study, Egge & Aksnes (1992)<ref name=egge92/> found that diatom dominance of mesocosm communities was directly related to the availability of silicate.  When silicon content approaches a concentration of 2 [[milli|m]][[Mole (unit)|mol]] [[Metre|m]]<sup>-3</sup>, diatoms typically represent more than 70% of the phytoplankton community.  Raven (1983)<ref name=raven83>Raven, J. A. (1983).  The transport and function of silicon in plants.  ''Biol. Rev.'' '''58''', 179-207.</ref> noted that, relative to organic cell walls, silica frustules require less energy to synthesize (approximately 8% of a comparable organic wall), potentially a significant saving on the overall cell energy budget.  Other researchers<ref name=milligan02>Milligan, A. J. and Morel, F. M. M. (2002).  [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/297/5588/1848 A proton buffering role for silica in diatoms].  ''Science'' '''297''', 1848-1850.</ref> have suggested that the biogenic silica in diatom cell walls acts as an effective [[pH]] [[buffering agent]], facilitating the conversion of [[bicarbonate]] to dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> (which is more readily assimilated).  Notwithstanding the possible advantages conferred by silicon, diatoms typically have higher growth rates than other algae of a corresponding size<ref name=furnas90/>.

Diatoms occur in virtually every environment that contains water.  This includes not only oceans, seas, lakes and streams, but also soil.

==Evolutionary history==
Heterokont chloroplasts appear to be derived from those of [[red alga]]e, rather than directly from [[prokaryote]]s as occurred in [[plant]]s.  This suggests they had a more recent origin than many other algae.  However, fossil evidence is scant, and it is really only with the evolution of the diatoms themselves that the heterokonts make a serious impression on the fossil record.

The earliest known fossil diatoms date from the early Jurassic (~185 [[Mega-annum|Ma]])<ref name=kooistra96>Kooistra, W. H. C. F. and Medlin, L. K. (1996).  Evolution of the diatoms (Bacillariophyta) : IV. A reconstruction of their age from small subunit rRNA coding regions and the fossil record.  ''Mol. Phylogenet. Evol.'' '''6''', 391-407.</ref>,  although recent [[molecular clock]]<ref name=kooistra96/> and [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]]<ref name=schieber00>Schieber, J., Krinsley, D. and Riciputi, L. (2000).  [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v406/n6799/abs/406981a0.html Diagenetic origin of quartz silt in mudstones and implications for silica cycling].  ''Nature'' '''406''', 981-985.</ref> evidence suggests an earlier origin.  It has been suggested that their origin may be related to the end-[[Permian]] [[mass extinction]] (~250 Ma), after which many marine [[ecological niche|niche]]s were opened<ref name=medlin97>Medlin, L. K., Kooistra, W. H. C. F., Gersonde, R., Sims, P. A. and Wellbrock, U. (1997).  Is the origin of the diatoms related to the end-Permian mass extinction?  ''Nova Hedwegia'' '''65''', 1-11.</ref>.  The gap between this event and the time that fossil diatoms first appear may indicate a period when diatoms were unsilicified and their evolution was [[cryptic (zoology)|cryptic]]<ref name=raven04>Raven, J. A. and Waite, A. M. (2004).  [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01022.x The evolution of silicification in diatoms : inescapable sinking and sinking as escape?]  ''New Phytologist'' '''162''', 45-61.</ref>.  Since the advent of silicification, diatoms have made a significant impression on the fossil record, with major deposits of fossil diatoms found as far back as the early [[Cretaceous]], and some rocks ([[diatomaceous earth]], diatomite, kieselguhr) being composed almost entirely of them.

Although the diatoms may have existed since the [[Triassic]], the timing of their ascendancy and "take-over" of the silicon cycle is more recent.  Prior to the [[Phanerozoic]] (before 544 Ma), it is believed that [[bacteria|microbial]] or [[inorganic]] processes weakly regulated the ocean's silicon cycle<ref name=siever91>Siever, R. (1991).  Silica in the oceans : biological-geological interplay.  In : Schneider, S. H., Boston, P. H. (eds.), ''Scientists On Gaia'', The MIT Press, Cambridge MA, USA, pp. 287-295.</ref><ref name=kidder01>Kidder, D. L. and Erwin, D. H. (2001).  [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/resolve?id=doi:10.1086/320794 Secular distribution of biogenic silica through the Phanerozoic : Comparison of silica-replaced fossils and bedded cherts at the series level].  ''J. Geol.'' '''109''', 509-522.</ref><ref name=grenne03>Grenne, T. and Slack, J. F. (2003).  [http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/31/4/319 Paleozoic and Mesozoic silica-rich seawater : evidence from hematitic chert (jasper) deposits].  ''Geology'' '''31''', 319-322.</ref>.  Subsequently, the cycle appears dominated (and more strongly regulated) by the [[radiolaria]]ns and [[sea sponge|siliceous sponges]], the former as [[zooplankton]], the latter as [[sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]] [[filter feeder]]s primarily on the [[continental shelf|continental shelves]]<ref name=racki00>Racki, G. and Cordey, F. (2000).  Radiolarian palaeoecology and radiolarites : is the present the key to the past?  ''Earth-Science Reviews'' '''52''', 83-120.</ref>.  Within the last 100 My, it is thought that the silicon cycle has come under even tighter control, and that this derives from the ecological ascendancy of the diatoms.  

However, the precise timing of the "take-over" is unclear, and different authors have conflicting interpretations of the fossil record.  Some evidence, such as the [[eviction]] of siliceous sponges from the shelves<ref name=maldonado99>Maldonado, M., Carmona, M. C., Uriz, J. M. and Cruzado, A. (1999).  [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v401/n6755/abs/401785a0.html Decline in Mesozoic reef-building sponges explained by silicate limitation].  ''Nature'' '''401''', 785-788.</ref>, suggests that this takeover began in the Cretaceous (146 Ma to 65 Ma), while evidence from radiolarians suggests "take-over" did not begin until the [[Cenozoic]] (65 Ma to present)<ref name=harper75>Harper, H. E. and Knoll, A. H. (1975).  [http://www.gsajournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&doi=10.1130%2F0091-7613%281975%293%3C175%3ASDACRE%3E2.0.CO%3B2 Silica, diatoms, and Cenozoic radiolarian evolution].  ''Geology'' '''3''', 175-177.</ref>.  Nevertheless, regardless of the details of the "take-over" timing, it is clear that this most recent [[revolution]] has installed much tighter biological control over the [[biogeochemical cycle]] of silicon.

==Collection==
Living diatoms are often found clinging in great numbers to filamentous algae, or forming gelatinous masses on various submerged plants. ''[[Cladophora]]'' is frequently covered with ''[[Cocconeis]]'', an elliptically shaped diatom; ''[[Vaucheria]]'' is often covered with small forms. Diatoms are frequently present as a brown, slippery coating on submerged stones and sticks, and may be seen to "stream" with river current.

The surface mud of a pond, ditch, or lagoon will almost always yield some diatoms.  They can be made to emerge by filling a jar with water and mud, wrapping it in black paper and letting direct sunlight fall on the surface of the water. Within a day, the diatoms will come to the top in a scum and can be isolated. 

Since diatoms form an important part of the food of [[mollusc]]s, [[tunicate]]s, and [[fish]]es, the [[alimentary tract]]s of these animals often yield forms that are not easily secured in other ways.  Marine diatoms can be collected by direct water sampling, though benthic forms can be secured by scraping [[barnacle]]s, [[oyster]] shells, and other shells.

The silicious shells of diatoms are among the most beautiful objects which can be examined with the [[microscope]]. To obtain perfectly clean mounts requires considerable time and patience, but once the material is cleaned, preparations may be made at any time with very little trouble.

==Genome sequencing==
The entire [[genome]] of the centric diatom, ''[[Thalassiosira pseudonana]]'', has been [[genome sequencing|sequenced]]<ref name=armbrust04>Armbrust ''et al.'' (2004).  [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/306/5693/79 The genome of the diatom ''Thalassiosira pseudonana'': ecology, evolution, and metabolism]. ''Science'' '''306''', 79-86.</ref>, and the sequencing of a second diatom genome from the pennate diatom ''[[Phaeodactylum tricornutum]]'' is in progress. The first insights into the genome properties of the ''P. tricornutum'' gene repertoire was described using 1,000 [[Expressed sequence tag|ESTs]]<ref name=scala02>Scala, S., Carels, N., Falciatore, A., Chiusano, M.L. and Bowler, C. (2002).  [http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/129/3/993 Genome properties of the diatom ''Phaeodactylum tricornutum'']. ''Plant Physiology'' '''129''', 993-1002.</ref>. Subsequently, the number of ESTs was extended to 12,000 and the Diatom EST Database was constructed for functional analyses<ref name=maheswari05>Maheswari, U., Montsant, A., Goll, J., Krishnasamy, S., Rajyashri, K.R., Patell, V.M. and Bowler, C. (2005).  [http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/33/suppl_1/D344 The Diatom EST Database]. ''Nucleic Acids Research'' '''33''', 344<U+2013>347.</ref>. These sequences have been used to make a comparative analysis between ''P. tricornutum'' and the putative complete proteomes from the [[green algae|green alga]] ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'', the [[red algae|red alga]] ''[[Cyanidioschyzon merolae]]'', and the centric diatom ''T. pseudonana''<ref name=montsant05>Montsant, A., Jabbari, K., Maheswari, U. and Bowler, C. (2005).  [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1065351 Comparative Genomics of the Pennate Diatom ''Phaeodactylum tricornutum'']. ''Plant Physiology'' '''137''', 500-513.</ref>.

==Nanotechnology research==
The self-replicating properties of diatoms prove to be a great resource for [[Nanotechnology|nanotechnologists]] who desire to reproduce these properties.  Using genome mapping, biologists and nanotechnologists can isolate the [[protein]]s which assist in the deposition of silica during division.  With knowledge of the self-replicating properties, nanotechnologists can mimic this construction for various nanoscale '[[widget (economics)|widget]]s', optical systems, and materials for the [[semiconductor]] industry.  It may also be possible to use diatom shells as vehicles for drug delivery.  The development of a compustat can select certain diatom species by their properties and match them with nanotechnologies that would be most useful.  These small organisms can help biologists and nanotechnologists to work together to further research<ref>Bradbury, J. (2004).
