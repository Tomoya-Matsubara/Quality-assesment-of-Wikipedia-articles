==Early Phase==

===`Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>'s Tablets of the Divine Plan===
[[`Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>]] wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book ''[[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]''. The eighth and twelfth of the tablets mentioned [[Africa]] and were written on April 19, 1916 and February 15, 1917, respectively. Publication however was delayed in the United States until 1919<U+2014>after the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The tablets were translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in ''[[Star of the West (Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> magazine)|Star of the West]]'' magazine on December 12, 1919.<ref>{{cite book |last = Abbas | first = `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1> | coauthors = Mirza Ahmad Sohrab, trans. and comments | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation | year = 1919 | month = April | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}</ref> `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1> mentions Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s traveling "<U+2026>especially from America to Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, and travel through Japan and China.

===Establishment of the community===
During the end of the era of the [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]], the predecessor colonial country, under the [[Union of South Africa]].  In 1953 [[Shoghi Effendi]], head of the religion after the death of `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>, planned an international teaching plan termed the [[Ten Year Crusade]].<ref name ="history"/>  During the plan pioneers moved to many countries including Botswana from places. This was during a period of wide scale growth in the religion across [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] near the end of the period of [[Colonisation of Africa]].<ref name="UofC">{{cite web   | title = Overview Of World Religions   | work = General Essay on the Religions of Sub-Saharan Africa | publisher = Division of Religion and Philosophy, [[University of Cumbria]]   | url =http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/sub/geness.html   | accessdate = 2008-04-16 }}</ref> The goal of establishing a Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> presence in Bechuanaland was assigned to the National Assembly of Iran then still in operation.<ref>{{cite journal | title = The Guardian's Message to the Africa Intercontinnental Conference| journal = Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> News | year = 1953 | month = March | page = 1-3| url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=03&page=863| issue = 281| issn=0195-9212}}</ref> However by November 1953 recent arrivals the Johnsons from America then in South Africa saw the arrival of John and Audrey<ref name="BN281">{{cite journal | title =  Pioneer Letters; Excerpts from Pioneer Letter to the Africa Teaching Committee; ''Johannesburg, March, 1954''| journal = Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> News | year = 1954 | month = July | page = 6 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=04&page=6| issue = 281| issn=0195-9212}}</ref> Robarts and son Patrick and daughter Nina from Canada who were assisted in reaching [[Mafeking]]<ref name="BN279">{{cite journal | title =  Pioneer Letters; Excerpts from Pioneer Letter to the Africa Teaching Committee; ''Edith and Lowell Johnson, Capetown, South Africa''| journal = Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> News | year = 1954 | month = June |page = 15 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=03&page=1063|issue = 280| issn=0195-9212}}</ref> (then in Bechuanaland) as Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> [[Pioneering (Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>)|pioneers]] where they arrived by October 1954<ref name="BN280"/> and were recognized as the first Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s to the country earning the title [[Knight of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h]] from the then head of the Faith, Shoghi Effendi.<ref name="Golden"/> The Robarts had joined the religion in 1938 and when the first National Spiritual Assembly of Canada was formed at in 1948 and John was elected chairman, a post he held until 1953 when they moved.<ref name="StLucia">{{cite web

In 2005 Lally Warren recalled that as a young child in Mafikeng it had been unusual to meet white people who were pleasant to her so she believed that all white people were bad.<ref name="Golden"/> That changed when she met the Robarts family. "The Robarts didn't treat me like a black child, they treated me as a child," she said. She recalled when she was 10 and the Robarts family came to her house for meetings with her parents, James and Stella Moncho, the first local couple to become Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s, "They could only do this at night, and as they came towards the house they would switch their [car] lights on and off to say, 'Is it ok, is it safe, can we come?'<U+2026>There was no electricity in the black area during those days so my mother would take a lantern and stick it out through the window and wave it to say, 'OK, it's safe for you to come.'"<ref name="Golden"/>

The Robarts family befriended Modiri Molema, a highly respected medical doctor and the only black man who was permitted to associate with whites.<ref name="Golden"/> Dr. Molema invited his friends and family to hear about the religion, and he gave the Robarts family letters of introduction to the [[Kgosi]] (traditional chiefs) of the Bechuanaland Protectorate. Dr. Molema converted to the religion but his enrollment was not made public because of likely harassment due to his previous high-profile political involvement. In 1955 his relative, Stanlake Kukama, became the first native Tswana of Bechuanaland to become a publicly declared Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>. In 2005 Kukama recalled he had been an anti-apartheid activist, and was a member of the South African political party, the [[African National Congress]] and had detested white people because of their attitude towards Africans but that changed when he heard about the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith from the Robarts family: "In 1955 I heard of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith and [found] the principles of the Faith were the solution to [achieve] peace and harmony for mankind.<U+2026> I realized that the white and the black were all blind. They did not see the truth, they did not have the eye of the soul. Hence, I became a Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>, and renounced man-made solutions to peace."<ref name="Golden"/> The African National Congress tried to woo back Mr. Kukama for many years without success. The police kept him under surveillance even after he became a Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> because they did not believe that he had given up partisan politics. Mr. Kukama later served for many years both as a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s of Bophuthatswana and of South Africa.<ref name="Golden"/>

In April 1956 the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith was present in small numbers across 15 countries of southern Africa. To administer these communities a regional National Spiritual Assembly was elected in South West Africa to cover them.<ref name="stats"/> In 1956 John Robarts was elected to it.<ref name="StLucia"/>

By early 1957 the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> community numbered between 10 and 20 individuals and became part of the regional national assembly of South and West Africa.  By 1963 there were two assemblies; seven groups, and one isolated member.<ref name="Graham2000"/> The assemblies were in [[Lobatse]], and [[Mahalapye]] and groups in [[Gaborone]], [[Ghanzi]], [[Kopong]], [[Mafeking]], [[Molepolole]], [[Morwa]],[[Serowe]], and a lone Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> in [[Moeng]] (which is near the [[Tswapong Hills]]).<ref name="stats"/>

==National development==
Following the death of Shoghi Effendi, the elected [[Universal House of Justice]] was head of the religion and began to re-organized the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> communities of Africa, including Botswana, by splitting off national communities to form their own National Assemblies from 1964 though the 1990s.<ref name="history">{{cite web

Hope, and John D. Sargent Sr. There were ten delegates, sixty additional visitors for the fourth annual convention, held in Salisbury, Rhodesia.

In 1970 the first National Youth School in Botswana was attended by over thirty youth, adults and teachers.<ref>{{cite journal |title = Botswana - First Youth Institute| journal = Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> News | year = 1970 | month = December |page = 11 |url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=07&page=691| issue = 477| issn=0195-9212}}</ref> Following the classes the youth visited three villages previously arranged by the national assembly with the approval of the local chiefs where they presented a well received speech especially prepared for them. Because of the reception of the speech they were invited to a further six villages by the chiefs of those villages ultimately presenting the religion to almost 700 attendees of the presentations. Coverage of the tour was also done on local radio. Later the first Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s from the [[Bushmen]] and the [[Kgalagadi]] had joined the religion.

The time came for the election of Botswana's Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> [[National Spiritual Assembly]] elected in 1970.<ref name="BN492a"/> Its members in the 1971 re-election were:<ref name="BN492a"/> Stanley Matenge, Esther Moncho, Isaac Kgang, Dennis Makiwa, Maureen Gruber, Robert Sarracino, Bogatlu Pheto, Jeffrey Gruber, and Broer Oageng.

In August 1971 the first public talks on the religion in [[Gaborone]] were undertaken and was broadcast over [[List_of_radio_stations_in_Africa#.C2.A0Botswana|Radio Botswana]] on the topic of "African Traditional Beliefs and the Unity of the World Religions".<ref name="BN492a"/> A review of the community then noted that the national assembly and five local assemblies had incorporated and registered with the government. The national assembly then became legal owners of the national Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> center. Sixty-seven localities had been introduced to the religion and translations of some Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> scripture had been accomplished. Some forty chiefs at various levels had been sent messages by the national assembly about the religion. Fifty-seven villages had been visited with mass meetings resulting. There were only four pioneers present then. The village of Boneapitse was noted as being a majority of Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s.

An all-Bushman local assembly was first elected in [[Tshasane]] in 1972.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Bushman Assembly| journal = Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> News | year = 1974 | month = February |page = 6 |url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=08&page=584| issue = 492|issn=0195-9212}}</ref> When it was re-elected in 1973 its members were: <nowiki>Ci-!Gau, !'ea, Titi, Diolo, Kaka, Mashipa, N!!g''ae-!Nobo, Baberi, Mpalo.</nowiki>

===Visits of Hands of the Cause===

[[Hands of the Cause]] are a select group of Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s, appointed for life, whose main function was to propagate and protect the religion. In May 1972 [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Adelbert M<U+00FC>hlschlegel]] was the first to tour Botswana.<ref name="BN492b">{{cite journal |title = Hand of Cause visits Botswana | journal = Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> News | year = 1972 | month = March |page = 12-13 |url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=08&page=36| issue = 683| issn=0195-9212}}</ref>

In November 1972 [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Enoch Olinga]] toured the country and visited three of the then newest and most active Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> communities in Botswana - [[Ratholo]] and [[Bonwapitse]] (both in the [[Tswapong Hills]] area), and Palla Road (aka [[Dinokwe]]) He reviewed understanding the religion in a non-literalist way, elaborated on the principals of the religion like of [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of humanity]], [[Progressive revelation (Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>)|progressive revelation]], and that the religion was present in many countries beyond their lands despite the fact that school books did not mention the religion. Later he gave a public talk entitled "The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith and the Social Order" and a radio interview in [[Gaborone]] where he addressed wide ranging topics from the definition of the word "Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>", the [[History of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith|history of the religion]], its relationship with [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith and the unity of religion|Christianity]] and the difficulties with social norms in [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith in South Africa|South Africa]].

In June 1973 Hand of the Cause [[Ruhiyyih Khanum]] toured the country for some 20 days.<ref>{{cite journal |title = The Great Safari of Hand of the Cause Ruhiyyih Khanum, part 15  | last = Nakhjavani | first = Violette | journal = Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> News | year = 1973 | month = April |page = 16-21 |url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=08&page=351| issue = 505| issn=0195-9212}}</ref> She was met an hour's walk from the village of [[Selebi-Phikwe]] by a new mother with a week old baby. At a few villages including [[Seleka]] she met with local school teachers. She congratulated the pioneers that were well out in the countryside rather than clustered in the capital. At another village she spoke at a teacher's training college noting the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> teaching of [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith and gender equality|equality of the sexes]] and the importance of mothers and teachers, [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith and education|eliminating illiteracy]] but that matters of faith are not dependent on book learning. In [[Bonwapitse]] she addressed the importance of prayer, the meaning of "[[All<U+00E1>h'u'Abh<U+00E1>]]". In [[Mmutlane]] she addressed the topic of dreams related about [[Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h]] and the [[B<U+00E1>b]]. She went on to other villages and illustrated diverse responses to faith. In the [[Kalahari Desert]] she met with Bushmen when only a few had joined the religion so far hoping the religion would help preserve their qualities of gentleness and goodness. Then she met with the national assembly especially about the topic of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> view of "consultation", that the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> funds are to be spent on specific purposes for the promulgation of the religion. At [[Lobatse]] she spoke at another teacher's training college on the importance of youth. The final village was [[Sub-districts_of_Botswana#Southern_District|Good Hope]] where she met the first Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s of Botswana -Mr. and Mrs. Moncho.

World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. 

===Youth projects===
Among the earliest development projects in Botswana was a systematic initiation of a major "Youth Year of Service" project which coordinated volunteer activities with assemblies with a defined need.<ref>{{cite journal |title = A look at programs around the world| journal = Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> News | year = 1988 | month = April |page = 2<U+2013>3|url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=12&page=265| issue = 505| issn=0195-9212}}</ref> This was extended by an orientation program of youth in diverse traditional African cultures.<ref>{{cite journal |title = Botswana | journal = Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> News | year = 1988 | month = December |page = 15|url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=12&page=431| issue = 505| issn=0195-9212}}</ref> Meanwhile recognition of the work of the national government in support of human rights was presented by the national assembly - at the reception ambassadors and diplomatic core from several countries and the UN.

An international youth conference was held in 1989 at which 120 people from 13 countries attended.<ref>{{cite journal |title = Botswana| journal = Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> News | year = 1990 | month = February |page = 14|url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=12&page=693| issue = 706| issn=0195-9212}}</ref> In December youth from [[Transkei]] were among the choirs that performed at a Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> International Music Festival in Botswana.<ref>{{cite journal |title = A Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> choir from... | journal = Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> News | year = 1990 | month = March |page = 16|url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=12&page=714| issue = 706| issn=0195-9212}}</ref>

During 1994-95, youth camps were particularly popular in Botswana where the community held the country's first youth camp. For one week, youth gathered at the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Institute in [[Mahalapye]] and studied the life of [[Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h]], the [[Kitab-i-Aqdas]], and such teachings of the religion as [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> marriage|chastity and marriage]], and the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith on life after death|immortality of the soul]].<ref>{{cite web
