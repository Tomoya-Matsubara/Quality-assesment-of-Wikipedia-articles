{{For|the places in Scotland|Blackness (disambiguation)}}

'''Blackness''' is the degree to which an individual, regardless of their [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] background, is sympathetic to or a part of the mainstream [[African-American]] [[African American culture|culture]].  A [[black sheep (term)|person]] may be thought of as "losing their blackness" by not adhering to the mainstream thoughts of the African-American community.  

==In Politics==
Former US President [[Bill Clinton]], despite being Caucasian, has been called "the first Black president."<ref>[http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/clinton/morrison.html Clinton as the first black president] ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Morrison, Toni, 1998, October</ref>

[[Debra Dickerson]], while speaking to [[Stephen Colbert]] on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' ([[February 8]], [[2007]]), stated that U.S. Senator [[Barack Obama]], despite having a father of Kenyan descent, was not black because he had not lived and suffered the same way as the offspring of African-American slaves. Dickerson even fell short of calling Obama an African-American, instead referring to him as [[African African-American]].
