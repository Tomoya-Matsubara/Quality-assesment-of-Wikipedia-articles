'''Madonna''' (born '''Madonna Louise Ciccone'''; August 16, 1958) is an American recording artist, actress and entrepreneur. Born in [[Bay City, Michigan]], she moved to [[New York City]] in 1977 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing in pop groups, she released her debut album in 1983. She followed it with a series of albums in which she found immense popularity by pushing the boundaries of lyrical content in mainstream popular music and imagery in her music videos, which became a fixture on MTV. Throughout her nearly three-decade career, most of her songs have hit number one on the record charts, including "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]", "[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]", "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]", "[[Music (Madonna song)|Music]]", "[[Hung Up]]", and "[[4 Minutes (Madonna song)|4 Minutes]]". Madonna has been praised by critics for her diverse musical productions while at the same time serving as a lightning rod for religious-related controversy.

Her popularity was further enhanced by a film career that began in 1985, but has received mixed commentary. She won critical acclaim and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress <U+2013> Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] for her role in ''[[Evita (film)|Evita]]'' (1996), but has received harsh feedback for other film roles. Madonna's other ventures include being a fashion designer, children's book author, film director and producer, and owner of her own recording company [[Maverick (entertainment company)|Maverick]] corporation, as a joint venture with [[Time Warner]]. She has received acclaim as a businesswoman and in 2007, she signed an unprecedented US $120&nbsp;million contract with [[Live Nation]].

Madonna has sold more than 200&nbsp;million albums worldwide. She is ranked by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) as the best-selling female rock artist of the 20th century, and the second top-selling female artist in the United States behind [[Barbra Streisand]], with 64&nbsp;million [[RIAA certification|certified]] albums. ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' listed her as the world's most successful female recording artist of all time. In 2008, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine ranked Madonna at number two behind only [[The Beatles]], on the "[[Billboard Hot 100 50th Anniversary Charts#All-Time top artists|''Billboard'' Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists]]", making her the most successful solo artist in the history of the chart. She was also inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Considered to be one of the most influential figures in contemporary music, Madonna is known for continuously reinventing both her music and image, and for retaining a standard of autonomy within the recording industry.

== Life and career ==
=== 1958<U+2013>81: Early life and beginnings ===
Madonna Louise Ciccone was born in Bay City, Michigan on August 16, 1958. Her mother, Madonna Louise (n<U+00E9>e Fortin), was of [[French Canadian]] descent, and her father, Silvio Anthony Ciccone, was a first-generation [[Italian American]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=10}}</ref> Ciccone's family originated from [[Pacentro]] in Italy; he later worked as a design engineer for [[Chrysler]] and [[General Motors]]. Madonna was nicknamed "Little Nonni" to distinguish her from her mother.<ref name="nowmadonna">{{cite news|first=Denise|last=Worrell|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957025,00.html |title=Now: Madonna on Madonna | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=1985-05-27|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref><ref name="thechild">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1400097/The-child-who-became-a-star.html|title=The Child Who Became a Star: Madonna Timeline|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2006-07-26|accessdate=2008-06-09| location=London}}</ref> The third of six children, her siblings are Martin, Anthony, Paula, [[Christopher Ciccone|Christopher]], and Melanie.<ref name="foxbio">{{cite web| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,193740,00.html?sPage=fnc.entertainment/madonna |title=Madonna Biography, Discography, Filmography|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] | accessdate=2008-06-05|date=2008-01-03}}</ref> Madonna was raised in the Detroit suburbs of [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] and Avon Township (now [[Rochester Hills, Michigan|Rochester Hills]]).

Her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 30, on December 1, 1963.<ref name="foxbio"/> Months before her mother's death, Madonna noticed changes in her behaviour and personality from the attentive homemaker she was, although she did not understand the reason.<ref name="mom"/> Mrs. Ciccone, at a loss to explain her dire medical condition, would often begin to cry when questioned by Madonna, at which point Madonna would respond by wrapping her arms around her mother tenderly. "I remember feeling stronger than she was," Madonna recalled, "I was so little and yet I felt like she was the child."<ref name="mom"/> Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying. "There was so much left unsaid, so many untangled and unresolved emotions, of remorse, guilt, loss, anger, confusion. [...] I saw my mother, looking very beautiful and lying as if she were asleep in an open casket. Then I noticed that my mother's mouth looked funny. It took me some time to realize that it had been sewn up. In that awful moment, I began to understand what I had lost forever. The final image of my mother, at once peaceful yet grotesque, haunts me today also."<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=47}}</ref>

Madonna eventually learned to take care of herself and her siblings, and she turned to her grandmother in the hope of finding some solace and some form of her mother in her. The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and invariably rebelled against anyone brought into their home ostensibly to take place of their beloved mother.<ref name="mom"/> In an interview with ''Vanity Fair'', Madonna commented that she saw herself in her youth as a "lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn't shave my underarms and I didn't wear make-up like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades.... I wanted to be somebody."<ref name="mom"/> Terrified that her father could be taken from her as well, Madonna was often unable to sleep unless she was near him.<ref name="mom"/> Her father married the family's housekeeper Joan Gustafson, and they had two children: Jennifer and Mario Ciccone.<ref name="peoplebio">{{cite news | title=Madonna Biography: Part 1| work = [[People (magazine)|People]]|url=http://www.people.com/people/madonna/biography | accessdate =2008-05-28|date=2003-09-02}}</ref> At this point, Madonna began to express unresolved feelings of anger towards her father, that lasted for decades, and developed a rebellious attitude.<ref name="mom"/> She attended St. Frederick's and St. Andrew's Elementary Schools, and then West Middle School. She was known for her high [[Grade (education)|grade point average]], and  achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior: she would perform cartwheels and handstands in the hallways between classes, dangle by her knees from the [[jungle gym|monkey bars]] during recess, and pull up her skirt during class<U+2014>all so that the boys could see her underwear.<ref name="tarabio">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=23}}</ref>

Gradually, Madonna's look and manner of dressing, her performances and her music videos started influencing young girls and women. Her style became a female fashion trend of the 1980s.

Madonna's music has been the subject of much analysis and scrutiny of critics. [[Robert M. Grant]], author of ''Contemporary Strategy Analysis'' (2005), commented that what has brought Madonna success is "certainly not outstanding natural talent. As a vocalist, musician, dancer, songwriter, or actress, Madonna's talents seem modest."<ref name=CSA>{{harvnb|Grant|2005|p=6}}</ref> He asserts Madonna's success is in relying on the talents of others, and that her personal relationships have served as cornerstones to the numerous reinventions in the longevity of her career.<ref name=CSA/> Conversely, ''Rolling Stone'' has named Madonna "an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics, and a better studio singer than her live spectacles attest."<ref name="Rolling Biography"/> [[Mark Bego]], author of ''Madonna: Blonde Ambition'', called her "the perfect vocalist for lighter-than-air songs", despite not being a "heavyweight talent."<ref>{{harvnb|Bego|2000|p=122}}</ref> Madonna has always been self-conscious about her voice, especially in comparison to her vocal idols such as [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Chaka Khan]].<ref name="fouzvocal"/>

According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, Madonna's talent for developing "incredible" hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience, even without the influence of the music.  As an example, Jarman-Ivens cites the 1985 single "[[Into the Groove]]" and its line "Live out your fantasy here with me, just let the music set you free; Touch my body, and move in time, now I know you're mine."<ref name="fouz55">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=55<U+2013>58}}</ref> From 1983 to 1986, Madonna's musical productions were often girlish and na<U+00EF>ve in nature, focusing primarily on love, romance, passion and boy-meets-girl relationships.<ref name="fouz55"/> This changed with the album ''Like a Prayer'', when the lyrics became much more personal, such as in "Promise to Try", which references Madonna's lingering pain at the loss of her mother.<ref name="fouz55"/> Madonna's lyrics often suggest an identification with the gay community. Fouz believes that when Madonna sings "Come on girls, do you believe in love?" in "[[Express Yourself (Madonna song)|Express Yourself]]", she is addressing both the gay audience and the heterosexual female.<ref name="fouz55"/> Even in the ''Erotica'' era, with its often adult-oriented lyrics, the songs appear free-flowing and gullible ("So won't you go down, where its warm inside" <U+2014> "Where Life Begins" from ''Erotica''). Madonna's songwriting ability has been criticized, with ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s Maria Raha calling her lyrics "flighty and not spohisticated. Madonna can only bring a trunk full of trite lyrics on the long standing tradition of pop music, love; when she wasn't singing about love, she was singing about partying and dancing."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Raha|first=Maria|date=1987-09-21|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|title=Cinderella's big score: women of the punk and indie underground |volume=1078|issue=09|issn=0032-791X}}</ref> Her lyrics were considered banal, and her songwriting capability was largely ignored by critics until the release of ''Ray of Light'' and ''Music''. According to Jarman-Ivens, lyrics such as "You're frozen, when your heart's not open" ("[[Frozen (song)|Frozen]]", 1998) and "I can't remember, when I was young, I can't express if it was wrong" ("Paradise Not For Me", 2000) reflected an artistic palette, "encompassing diverse musical, textual and visual styles in its lyrics."<ref name="fouz55"/>

On her 1983 debut album, Madonna's vocal abilities and personal artistry were not fully formed. Her vocal style and lyrics was similar to other pop stars of that period like [[Paula Abdul]], [[Debbie Gibson]] and [[Taylor Dayne]].<ref name="fouzvocal">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=59<U+2013>61}}</ref> The songs on ''Madonna'' reveal several key trends that have continued to define her success, including a strong dance-based idiom, catchy [[hook (music)|hooks]], highly polished [[music arranger|arrangement]]s and Madonna's own vocal style. In songs such as "Lucky Star" and "Borderline", Madonna introduced a style of upbeat dance music that would prove particularly appealing to gay audiences. The bright, girlish vocal [[timbre]] of the early years became pass<U+00E9> in Madonna's later works, the change being deliberate, since Madonna was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labelled her as "Minnie Mouse on helium", because of her early voice.<ref name="fouzvocal"/> Her second album, ''Like a Virgin'' (1984), foreshadowed several trends in Madonna's later works. It contained references to classical works ([[pizzicato]] synthesizer line that opens "[[Angel (Madonna song)|Angel]]"); potential negative reaction from social groups ("[[Dress You Up]]" was blacklisted by the [[Parents Music Resource Center]]); and retro styles ("Shoo-Bee-Doo", Madonna's homage to [[Motown]]).<ref name="fouzvocal"/> Madonna's early style, and the change that she ushered in it, is best evident in the song "Material Girl". It opens with Madonna using a little-girl voice, but following the first verse, she switches to a richer, more mature voice in the [[chorus effect|chorus]].<ref name="fouzvocal"/> This mature artistic statement was visible in ''True Blue'' (1986). The song "Papa Don't Preach" was a significant milestone in her artistic career. The classical introduction, fast tempo and the gravity in her voice was unprecedented in Madonna's <U+0153>uvre at that time.<ref name="fouzvocal"/>

With ''Like a Prayer'' (1989), Madonna again entered a new phase, musically. The album introduced live recorded songs and incorporated different genres of music, including dance, [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and gospel music.<ref name="bookalbum"/> Madonna continued to compose ballads and [[uptempo]] dance songs for ''Erotica'' (1992) and ''Bedtime Stories'' (1994). She tried to remain contemporary by incorporating samples, drum loops and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] into her music. Her voice grew much deeper and fuller, evident in the tracks like "Rain" and "Take a Bow".<ref>{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=44}}</ref> During the filming of ''Evita'', Madonna had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented, "I studied with a vocal coach for ''Evita'' and I realized there was a whole piece of my voice I wasn't using. Before, I just believed I had a really limited range and was going to make the most of it."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lamsweerde|first=Inez van|coauthors=Matadin, Vinoodh|date=April 1998|title=Madonna Chooses Dare|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|publisher=SPIN Media LLC|volume=14|issue=4|pages=72|issn=0886-3032|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Jq-A2xEoAHIC&dq=madonna+vocal+evita&lr=&source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=2010-02-26}}</ref> Continuing her musical evolution with ''Ray of Light'', the track "Frozen" displayed her fully formed vocal prowess and her allusions to classical music. Her vocals were restrained and she sang the songs in ''Ray of Light'' without vibrato. However, the intake of breath within the songs became more prominent.<ref name="fouzvocal"/> With the new millennium came her album ''Music'' in which Madonna sang in her normal voice in a medium range, and sometimes in a higher register for the chorus. Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez commented that "Throughout her career, Madonna's manipulation of her voice shows us that, by refusing to be defined in one way, she has in fact opened up a space for new kinds of musical analysis."<ref name="fouzvocal"/>

=== Influences ===
[[File:Marilyn Monroe in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes trailer.jpg|thumb|[[Marilyn Monroe]] had a profound influence on Madonna.|alt=Bust of a blond woman in short curled hair and wearing a bright pink, sleeveless dress. Putting both her hands up, she looks to the right of the image.]]

According to Taraborrelli, "Almost certainly, the defining moment of Madonna's childhood<U+2014>the one that would have the most influence in shaping her into the woman she would become<U+2014>was the tragic and untimely death of her beloved mother."<ref name="mom">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=11<U+2013>13}}</ref> Psychiatrist Keith Ablow suggests that her mother's death would have had an immeasurable impact on the young Madonna at a time when her personality was still forming. According to Ablow, the younger a child is at the time of a serious loss,  the more profound the inluence and the longer lasting the impact. He concludes that "some people never reconcile themselves to such a loss at an early age, Madonna is not different than them."<ref name="mom"/>

As they grew older, Madonna and her sisters would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began drifting, farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come to think that she resembled poet [[Anne Sexton]] and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry with [[Sylvia Plath]] being her favourite.<ref name="mom"/> Later, Madonna commented: "We were all wounded in one way or another by [her death], and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying<U+2014>after I got over my heartache<U+2014>I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself."<ref name="mom"/> Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. "Her death had taught her a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness<U+2014>particularly her own<U+2014>and wanted to be the queen of her own castle."<ref name="mom"/>

In 1985, Madonna commented that the first song to ever make a strong impression on her was "[[These Boots Are Made for Walkin']]" by [[Nancy Sinatra]]; she said it summed up her own "take-charge attitude".<ref name="hot"/> As a young woman, she attempted to broaden her taste in literature, art, and music, and during this time became interested in classical music. She noted that her favorite style was [[baroque music|baroque]], and loved [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin|Chopin]] because she liked their "feminine quality".<ref>{{harvnb|St. Michael|2004|p=199}}</ref> Other musical influences included artists [[Karen Carpenter]], [[The Supremes]], [[Led Zeppelin]], and dancers such as [[Martha Graham]] and [[Rudolf Nureyev]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9901/19/madonna.lkl/|last=King|first=Larry|authorlink=Larry King|title=Interview: Madonna reviews life on Larry King Live| work=CNN| date=1999-01-19|accessdate=2008-06-09}}</ref> Madonna's Italian-Catholic background and her relationship with her parents were reflected in the album ''Like a Prayer''.<ref name="laprsreview"/> It was an evocation of the impact religion had on her career.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|p=126<U+2013>131}}</ref> Her video for the title track contains Catholic symbolism, such as the stigmata.

During her childhood, Madonna was inspired by actors, later saying, "I loved [[Carole Lombard]] and [[Judy Holliday]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]]. They were all incredibly funny&nbsp;... and I saw myself in them&nbsp;... my girlishness, my knowingness and my innocence."<ref name="hot">{{cite journal | last=Worrell | first=Denise | title=Madonna, Why She's Hot | journal=Time|date=1985-05-27| accessdate=2007-12-16|issn= 0040-781X}}</ref> Her "Material Girl" music video recreated Monroe's look in the song "[[Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend]]", from the film ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (film)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]''. She studied the screwball comedies of the 1930s, particularly those of Lombard, in preparation for the film ''Who's That Girl''. The video for "Express Yourself" (1989) was inspired by [[Fritz Lang]]'s [[silent film]] ''[[Metropolis (film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927). The video for "Vogue" recreated the style of [[Hollywood glamour]] photographs, in particular those by [[Horst P. Horst]], and imitated the poses of [[Marlene Dietrich]], Carole Lombard and [[Rita Hayworth]], while the lyrics referred to many of the stars who had inspired her, including [[Bette Davis]], described by Madonna as an idol.<ref name="carrie"/><ref>{{harvnb|Victor|2001|p=78}}</ref> Influences also came to her from the art world, most notably through the works of artist [[Frida Kahlo]].<ref>{{harvnb|Voller|1999|p=170}}</ref> The music video of the song "Bedtime Story" featured images inspired by the paintings of Kahlo and [[Remedios Varo]].<ref>{{harvnb|Guralnick|Wolk|2000|p=149}}</ref> Her 2003 video for "[[Hollywood (Madonna song)|Hollywood]]" was an homage to the work of photographer [[Guy Bourdin]]; Bourdin's son subsequently filed a lawsuit for unauthorised use of his father's work.<ref>{{cite news|first=Gary|last=Susman|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,491440,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|title=Madonna Faces Copyright Suit Over Video Images|accessdate=2008-06-14}}</ref> [[Pop art]]ist [[Andy Warhol]]'s use of sadomasochistic imagery in his underground films were reflected in the music videos for "Erotica" and "Deeper and Deeper".<ref>{{harvnb|Guilbert|2002|p=69}}</ref> Madonna's film career has been largely received negatively by the film critic community.

Madonna is dedicated to [[Kabbalah]] and in 2004, she adopted the name Esther which in [[Hebrew]] means "star".<ref name="kab"/> She has donated millions of dollars to New York and London schools teaching the subject.<ref name="kab">{{harvnb|Friskics-Warren|2006|p=72}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rickross.com/reference/kabbalah/kabbalah88.html |title=Madonna opens her own school|work=[[The Times of India]]|last=Ross|first=Rick|date= 2004-08-05|accessdate= 2006-02-20|publisher=[[The Times Group]]}}</ref> After she joined the Jewish religion, she faced opposition from rabbis who felt Madonna's adoption of the Kabbalah was sacrilegious and a case of celebrity [[Society of Dilettanti|dilettantism]]. Madonna defended her studies, saying "It would be less controversial if I joined the Nazi Party", and that her involvement with the Kabbalah is "not hurting anybody."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/music/4393642.stm |title=Madonna defends Kabbalah interest|work=BBC|date=2005-10-21|accessdate=2008-06-03}}</ref> The influence of the Kaballah was subsequently observed in Madonna's music, especially albums like ''Ray of Light'' and ''Music''. According to scholar Bill Friskics-Warren, "the ethereal arrangement of music in these albums and the philosophizing, replete with references to gurus and fate-fitting karma, at first may seem like New Age lyrics, but a deep analysis yields a sense of connection that encompasses spiritual illumination and carnal ecstacy, in effect erasing the distinction betwen the two, and is the effect of her oblique Kabbalistic meditation on union and transcendence."<ref name="kab"/> During the Re-Invention World Tour, at one point in the show, Madonna and her dancers wore t-shirts that read "Kabbalists Do It Better".<ref name="kab"/>

=== Music videos and performances ===

In ''The Madonna Companion'', biographers Allen Metz and Carol Benson noted that more than any other recent pop artist, Madonna had used MTV and music videos to establish her popularity and enhance her recorded work.<ref name="metz2">{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=161}}</ref> According to them, many of her songs have the imagery of the music video in strong context, while referring to the music. The media and public reaction towards her most-discussed songs such as "Papa Don't Preach", "Like a Prayer" or "Justify My Love" had to do with the music videos created to promote the song and their impact, rather than the song itself.<ref name="metz2"/> Morton felt that "artistically, Madonna's songwriting is often overshadowed by her striking pop videos."<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=20}}</ref> Madonna's initial music videos reflected her American and Hispanic mixed street style combined with a flamboyant glamor.<ref name="metz2"/> She was able to transmit her avant-garde downtown New York fashion sense to the American audience.<ref>{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=163}}</ref> The imagery and incorporation of Hispanic culture and Catholic symbolism continued with the music videos from the ''True Blue'' era.<ref>{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=145}}</ref> Author [[Douglas Kellner]] noted, "such 'multiculturalism' and her culturally transgressive moves turned out to be highly successful moves that endeared her to large and varied youth audiences".<ref>{{harvnb|Kellner|1995|p=271}}</ref> Madonna's Spanish look in the videos became the fashion trend of that time, in the form of boleros and layered skirts, accessorizing with rosary beads and a crucifix as in the video of "La Isla Bonita".<ref>{{harvnb|Clerk|2002|p=44}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rettenmund|1995|p=34}}</ref> Academics noted that with her videos, Madonna was subtly reversing the usual role of male as the dominant sex.<ref>{{harvnb|Welton|1998|p=234}}</ref> This symbolism and imagery was probably the most prevalent in the music video for "Like a Prayer". The video included scenes of an African-American church choir, Madonna attracted to a statue of a black saint, and singing in front of burning crosses. This mix of the sacred and the profane upset the Vatican and resulted in the Pepsi commercial withdrawal.<ref>{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=70}}</ref>

Madonna's emergence occurred during the advent of MTV, and, according to Chris Nelson from ''[[The New York Times]]'', "with its almost exclusively [[lip-sync]]ed videos, ushered in an era in which average music fans might happily spend hours a day, every day, watching singers just mouth the words."<ref name="sync">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/01/arts/music/01NELS.html?pagewanted=1|title=Lip-Synching Gets Real|last=Nelson|first=Chris|date=2004-02-01|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2010-02-25}}</ref> The symbiotic relationship between the music video and lip-syncing led to a desire for the spectacle and imagery of the music video to be transferred to live stage shows. Chris Nelson of ''The New York Times'' reported, "Artists like Madonna and [[Janet Jackson]] set new standards for showmanship, with concerts that included not only elaborate costumes and precision-timed pyrotechnics but also highly athletic dancing. These effects came at the expense of live singing."<ref name="sync"/> Thor Christensen of the ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'' commented that while Madonna earned a reputation for lip-syncing during her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, she has subsequently reorganized her performances by "stay[ing] mostly still during her toughest singing parts and [leaves] the dance routines to her backup troupe&nbsp;... [r]ather than try to croon and dance up a storm at the same time."<ref name="lip-sync">{{citation| last1 = Christensen | first1 = Thor | title = Loose Lips: Pop Singers' Lip-Syncing In Concert Is An Open Secret| page = B.8 | newspaper = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | date = 2001-09-15| issn = 1068624X}}</ref> To allow for greater movement while dancing and singing, she was one of the earliest adopters of hands-free radio-frequency headset microphones, with the headset fastened over the ears or the top of the head, and the microphone capsule on a boom arm that extended to the mouth. Because of her prominent usage, the microphone design came to be known as the "Madonna mic".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://harada-sound.com/sound/handbook/rfmics.html|title=Kai Harada, sound designer and sound handbook author, writes about "The Feeding and Care of RF Microphones|last=Harada|first=Kai|date=2007-09-01|publisher=Harada-Sound.com|accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/wimbledons-no-1-seat-455502.html|title=Wimbledon's No 1 seat|last=Castle|first=Andrew|date=2007-07-02|work=The Independent|publisher=Independent News & Media|accessdate=2010-03-17|authorlink=Andrew Castle | location=London}}</ref>

Throughout her career Madonna has repeatedly reinvented herself through a series of visual and musical personas. Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez agrees that these reinventions are one of her key cultural achievements.<ref name="fouz3">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=168}}</ref> Madonna reinvented herself by working with upcoming talented producers and previously unknown artists, while remaining at the center of media attention. According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, "In doing so Madonna has provided an example of how to maintain one's career in the entertainment industry."<ref name="fouz3"/> Such reinvention was noted by scholars as the main tool in surviving the musical industry, for a female artist.<ref>{{harvnb|Tetzlaff|1993|p=259}}</ref> As Ian Youngs from [[BBC News]] commented, "Her ability to follow the latest trends and adapt her style has often been credited with preserving her appeal."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2953665.stm|title=Madonna fights to keep pop crown|work=BBC|date=2003-04-18|author=Ian Youngs|accessdate=2010-02-27}}</ref> Madonna's use of shocking sexual imagery has benefited her career and catalyzed public discourse on sexuality and feminism.<ref name="fouz3"/> ''The Times'' stated, "Madonna, whether you like her or not, started a revolution amongst women in music&nbsp;... Her attitudes and opinions on sex, nudity, style and sexuality forced the public to sit up and take notice."<ref name="fouz2"/> Rodger Streitmatter, author of ''Sex Sells!'' (2004), commented that "from the moment Madonna burst onto the nation's radar screen in the mid-1980s, she did everything in her power to shock the public, and her efforts paid off."<ref name="sex sells">{{harvnb|Streitmatter|2004|p=34}}</ref> Shmuel Boteach, author of ''Hating women'' (2005), felt that Madonna was largely responsible for erasing the line between music and pornography. He stated: "Before Madonna, it was possible for women more famous for their voices than their cleavage, to emerge as music superstars. But in the post-Madonna universe, even highly original performers such as Janet Jackson now feel the pressure to expose their bodies on national television to sell albums."<ref>{{harvnb|Boteach|2005|p=110}}</ref>

Madonna has influenced numerous music artists throughout her career. Mary Cross, in her book ''Madonna: A Biography'', wrote: "Her influence on pop music is undeniable and far-reaching. New pop icons from [[Nelly Furtado]] and [[Shakira]] to [[Gwen Stefani]] and [[Christina Aguilera]] (not to mention [[Britney Spears]]) owe Madonna, a debt of thanks for the template she forged, combining provocative sexiness and female power in her image, music, and lyrics."<ref>{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=107}}</ref> Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez gave his opinion that female pop performers such as Spears, the [[Spice Girls]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Kylie Minogue]] and [[Pink (singer)|Pink]] were like "Madonna's daughters in the very direct sense that they grew up listening to and admiring Madonna, and decided they wanted to be like her."<ref name="fouz4">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=161}}</ref> Among them, Madonna's influence was most notable in Spears, who has been called her prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>.<ref name="fouz2">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=162}}</ref> Madonna has also been credited with the introduction of European [[electronic dance]] music into mainstream American pop culture, and for bringing European producers such as [[Stuart Price]] and [[Mirwais Ahmadza<U+00EF>]] into the spotlight.<ref name="fouz"/> According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]], Madonna has sold more than 200&nbsp;million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/plat_month_20060913.html|first=Press Release|title=IFPI Platinum Europe Awards: July & August 2006|date=2006-09-13|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=2007-12-14}}</ref> She is ranked by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) as the best-selling female rock artist of the 20th century, and the second top-selling female artist in the United States behind [[Barbra Streisand]], with 64&nbsp;million [[RIAA certification|certified]] albums sold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTopArt |title=Top Selling Artists |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=2008-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?news_year_filter=1999&resultpage=2&id=3ABF3EC8-EF5B-58F9-E949-3B57F5E313DF|first=Press Release|title=The American Recording Industry Announces Its Artists of the Century| publisher=Recording Industry Association of America |date=1999-11-10|accessdate=2008-01-30}}</ref>
