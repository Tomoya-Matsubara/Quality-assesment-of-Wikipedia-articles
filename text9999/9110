"'''Jihad'''" is a song by the American [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]] which appears on their 2006 album ''[[Christ Illusion]]''. The track was primarily written by guitarist [[Jeff Hanneman]], and portrays the imagined viewpoint of a [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] terrorist. Slayer vocalist [[Tom Araya]] lent help during the lyrical process.

"Jihad" was met with mixed critical reviews upon its release, with critics focusing on the song's controversial subject matter. The song drew comparisons to the Slayer track "[[Angel of Death (song)|Angel of Death]]" which appears on the 1986 album ''[[Reign in Blood]].'' Also penned by Hanneman, "Angel of Death" caused outrage at the time of its release. Joseph Dias of the [[Mumbai]] Christian group ''Catholic Secular Forum'' expressed concern over "Jihad", which contributed to ''Christ Illusion'''s recall by [[EMI]] India, with no plans of a reissue in that country. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]]'s Broadcast Standards and Practices department censored "Jihad" for Slayer's first US network television appearance on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live]].'' Only the opening minute was broadcast over the show's credits, and 40% of the song lyrics were deleted.

Guitarist [[Kerry King]] has been outspoken in his defense of "Jihad", and has claimed that the song has the "coolest angle" on ''Christ Illusion''.<ref name="KingAtkinson"/> "These new songs aren't political at all," King states, "'Jihad', 'Eyes of the Insane' <U+2014> it's what's spewing out at us from the TV."<ref>{{cite web|title=After 25 years, Slayer keeps casting metal|author=Beck, Aaron|publisher=The Columbus Dispatch|date=2007-02-10|url=http://www.columbusdispatch.com/features-story.php?story=dispatch/2007/02/10/20070210-B1-02.html|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> He further clarified that the band was not attempting to promote the terrorist's perspective of the war, nor their ideological beliefs, though he expected others to assume that Slayer was doing so.<ref name="KingAtkinson"/> They did not wish to dwell on the topic "because every band on the planet already has" and "came from a certain perspective", so felt they had to present an alternative viewpoint.<ref name="KingAtkinson"/> "We're Slayer, we have to be different" was King's assertion.<ref name="KingAtkinson"/>

American singer songwriter [[Steve Earle]] attempted a similar concept in penning "John Walker's Blues" (from the 2002 album ''[[Jerusalem (album)|Jerusalem]]''), written as though from the perspective of the [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]-born [[John Walker Lindh]], a [[Taliban]] member captured during the 2001 US-led [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|invasion of Afghanistan]].<ref name="KingAtkinson"/><ref name="Sculley">{{cite web| title=Metal gods Slayer gear up for this summer's most brutal road trek, the Unholy Alliance Tour| author=Sculley, Alan| publisher = CityBeat.com| date = | url = http://www.citybeat.com/2006-06-14/music.shtml|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> Earle received criticism for the track.

==Music and structure==
"Jihad" spans 3:31 minutes.<ref name="AllMusicReview">{{cite web| title = All Music Guide Review - ''Christ Illusion''|author = Jurek, Thom|publisher = [[All Music Guide]]|url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:rwf2zfi5eh7k~T1|accessdate = 2007-03-11}}</ref> A little skittering [[vamp (music)|vamp]] leads into the track, where Lombardo shimmers his [[hi-hat]].<ref name="AllMusicReview"/> Smoothly mixing up tempos, Slayer then begins to enter with a fast,<ref name="NYTReview">{{cite news | last = Ratliff| first = Ben| title =New CD's| work =| pages =| publisher = The New York Times  | date = 2006-08-14  | url =|accessdate=}}</ref> wonky,<ref name="Popmatters">{{cite web|title= Christ Illusion - Review|author=Begrand, Adrien|publisher=[[Popmatters]]|date=|url= http://www.popmatters.com/pm/music/reviews/slayer-christ-illusion/|accessdate=2007-04-12}}</ref> catchy and angular little<ref name="Popmatters"/> [[guitar riff]] reminiscent of the breakdown in 1986's "[[Angel of Death (song)|Angel of Death]]."<ref>{{cite web|title= Christ Illusion - Review|author=Lee, Cosmo|publisher=[[Stylus Magazine]]|date=|url= http://stylusmagazine.com/reviews/slayer/christ-illusion.htm|accessdate=2007-04-12}}</ref>
This guitar riff decelerates and bursts forward again in two-bar stretches over Lombardo's pounding, fifth-gear drumming.<ref name="NYTReview"/>

[[IGN]] reviewer Andy Patrizio was dismissive of the song's music and structure alongside other tracks from ''Christ Illusion'':  "'Jihad,' 'Flesh Storm,' 'Skeleton Christ,' 'Supremist,' after a while they are a blur of the same riffs, tuning, [[tempos]] and [[arrangements]]."<ref name="IGN">{{cite web|title= Christ Illusion - Review|author=Patrizio, Andy|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2006-08-14|url= http://uk.music.ign.com/articles/725/725459p1.html|accessdate=2007-04-12}}</ref>

==Reception and criticism==
"Jihad", alongside fellow ''[[Christ Illusion]]'' album tracks "[[Eyes of the Insane]]" and "Cult", was made available for streaming via [[Spain|Spanish]] website ''Rafabasa.com'' on [[June 26]], [[2006 in music|2006]].<ref>{{cite web|title=SLAYER: Three New Tracks Available In Streaming Audio|author=|publisher = [[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=[[2006-06-26]]|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=54247|accessdate = 2007-03-11}}</ref> Slayer's ninth [[studio album]] ''[[Christ Illusion]]'' was released on [[August 8]] [[2006]], hosting the track's inclusion. The song met mixed reviews.

''[[Blabbermouth.net|Blabbermouth]]'''s Don Kaye judged that "a handful of songs" on ''Christ Illusion'' "are either too generic or the arrangements too clumsy to work well (I'm looking at you, 'Jihad' and 'Skeleton Christ')"<ref name="BlabbermouthReview">{{cite web|title = Blabbermouth Review - ''Christ Illusion''|author=Kaye, Don|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=817|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> Ben Ratliff of ''[[New York Times]]'' remarked that the song "is predictably tough stuff, but let's put it on a scale. It is tougher, and less reasoned, than Martin Amis's recent short story 'The Last Days of Muhammad Atta.' It is no tougher than a taped message from Al Qaeda."<ref name="NYTReview"/> Peter Atkinson of ''KNAC.com'' was equally unimpressed, describing the group's choice of song climax as:<ref name="KNACReview">{{cite web|title=KNAC Review - Christ Illusion|author=Atkinson, Peter|publisher=KNAC.com|date=[[2006-07-24]]|url=http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=4789|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref>

{{cquotetxt|..the same sort of detached, matter-of-fact tactic Hanneman and Araya have employed for <U+201C>difficult<U+201D> subjects in the past <U+2014> Josef Mengele's Nazi atrocities in <U+201D>[[Angel of Death (song)|Angel of Death]]<U+201D> or [[Jeffrey Dahmer]]/[[Ed Gein]]'s ghoulish proclivities in <U+201C>213<U+201D> and "[[Seasons in the Abyss|Dead Skin Mask]]" <U+2014> with great effect. But here it feels atypically crass and exploitative, as if it was done purely to get a rise out of people... And Slayer's usually a lot more clever than that.}}

However, not all reviews were so negative. Thom Jurek of ''[[All Music Guide]]'' commented "the band begins to enter and twist and turn looking for a place to create a new rhythmic thrash that's the most insane deconstruction of four/four time on tape."<ref name="AllMusicReview" /> Marc Savlov of ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' asked people to "listen to the eerie, stop-start cadence of lunacy in "Jihad," with Araya essaying the role of a suicide bomber almost too convincingly."<ref>{{cite web|title= Christ Illusion - Review|author=Savlov, Marc|publisher=[[Austin Chronicle]]|date=2006-09-01|url= http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/review?oid=oid%3A399559/|accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref> 

King would have appointed "Jihad" as the group's nomination in the "[[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]]" award category at the [[49th Grammy Awards]], deeming the chosen track "[[Eyes of the Insane]]" "the poorest representations" of the group on ninth studio album ''Christ Illusion''.<ref>{{cite news | last = Piccoli| first = Sean| title =Grammy for Slayer's 11th album shows metal legends are now a household name| work =| pages =| publisher = Sun-Sentinel.com  | date = 2007-02-21  | url =|accessdate=}}</ref> Despite King's statement, "Eyes of the Insane" won Slayer their first Grammy award.<ref>{{cite web|title=SLAYER Wins GRAMMY In 'Best Metal Performance' Category|author=|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=[[2007-02-11]]|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=66845|accessdate=2007-02-12}}</ref>

"Jihad"'s lyrical matter provoked controversy from several quarters; Peter Atkinson of ''KNAC.com'' remarked that the song "no doubt will be ''Christ Illusion''<U+2019>s most controversial track <U+2014> especially if some flag-waving [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] dipshit like [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] or [[Sean Hannity]] gets clued in."<ref name="KNACReview"/> In May 2006, ''World Entertainment News Network'' announced that revelations of the song's lyrical content had angered the families of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11]] victims.<ref>{{cite web|title=SLAYER Spark 9/11 Controversy|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=[[2006-05-27]]|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=52892|accessdate =2007-03-11}}</ref>
