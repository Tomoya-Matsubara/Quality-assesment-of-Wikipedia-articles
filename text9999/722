'''Megan Neyer''' (born June 11, 1962) is an American former competition [[springboard]] and [[platform diving|platform]] diver.

== Early years ==

Neyer was born in [[Ashland, Kentucky]] in 1962, but moved to [[Mission Viejo, California]] to further her athletic training.

== Diving career ==

Neyer won the United States Olympic trials in both springboard and platform diving in 1980, but did not participate in the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]] because of the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] arising from the [[Soviet Union]]'s 1979 invasion of [[Afghanistan]].

Neyer accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the [[University of Florida]] in Gainesville, Florida, where she competed in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) competition as a member of coach [[Randy Reese]]'s [[Florida Gators swimming and diving]] team in 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1986.<ref name=ufmediasupp>''[http://web.gatorzone.com/swimmingdiving/media/2011/supplement.pdf  Florida Swimming & Diving 2011&ndash;12 Media Supplement]'', University Athletic Association, Gainesville, Florida, pp. 61, 62, 64&ndash;65, 67&ndash;68, 79 (2011).

Between 1981 and 1988, Neyer won fifteen national springboard diving championships&mdash;eight outdoor events and seven in the indoor events.  In 1987, she won the U.S. national championship in the indoor three-meter springboard event and the outdoor one-meter springboard, and the springboard silver medal in the Pan American Games.<ref>Associated Press, "[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/10/sports/pan-am-games-us-diver-wins.html?scp=5&sq=%22Megan%20Neyer%22&st=cse  Pan Am Games; U.S. Diver Wins]," ''The New York Times'' (August 10, 1987).
