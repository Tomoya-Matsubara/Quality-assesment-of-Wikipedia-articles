'''Javier Teucli Rold<U+00E1>n''' (born July 3, 1968 in [[Puebla, Puebla]], [[Mexico]] is a retired Mexican ''[[Lucha libre|Luchador]]'' or [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] best known under the name '''Sombrita''' ("Little Shadow"). Teucli also worked under the ring name '''Peque<U+00F1>o Bronce''' early in his career as a smaller version of the wrestling character [[Black Warrior (wrestler)|Bronce]]. Teucli worked in the ''[[Mini-Estrella]]'' division his entire career, working in the Mini division does not necessarily mean that Teucli has [[dwarfism]] as several short wrestlers work in the "Mini" division, which is what separates the Mexican ''Mini-Estrella'' from traditional [[Midget professional wrestling]] as practiced in the United States among other places.<ref name=MondoMini>{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha A Go-Go: the bizarre & honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=You ain't seen nothing yet: the minis|pages=209<U+2014>212|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}</ref>

==Professional wrestling career==
Teucli Rold<U+00E1>n trained for his [[professional wrestling]] career under [[Ray Mendoza]], [[Jos<U+00E9> Luis Feliciano]] and [[Hijo del Gladiador]] in the [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) wrestling school prior to making his in ring debut.<ref name=SombritaEncicliopedia>{{cite news | author = Enciclopedia staff | title = Enciclopedia de las Mascaras | work = Sombrita | location = [[Mexico]] | id = Tomo V | pages = 17 | date = December 1, 2007 | language = Spanish}}</ref>

===Peque<U+00F1>o Bronce (1992&ndash;1994)===
He made in ring debut for CMLL in August of 1992, brought in to CMLL to fill the void in their ''[[Mini-Estrella]]s'' division after a large portion of them left CMLL in the summer of 1992 to join the newly formed [[Asistencia Asesor<U+00ED>a y Administraci<U+00F3>n]] (AAA).<ref name=MondoMini>{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha a Go-Go: the bizarre & honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher= HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=You ain't seen nothing yet: the minis|pages=209<U+2014>212|id=ISBN 978-0-06-085583-3}}</ref> He initially competed as the masked "Peque<U+00F1>o Bronce" ("Little Bronze") a ''Mini-Estrella'' version of the wrestler known as [[Black Warrior (wrestler)|Bronce]].<ref name=LuchaMinis>{{cite book|title=Lucha Libre: Masked Superstars of Mexican Wrestling|publisher=Distributed Art Publishers, Inc.|year=2005|chapter=''La Peque<U+00F1>a Escala'' / On a small scale|pages=80<U+2013>86|id=ISBN 968-6842-48-9}}</ref> Peque<U+00F1>o Bronce regularly teamed with [[Mike Segura|Orito]], just like Bronce had often teamed with [[Oro (wrestler)|Oro]]. On October 26, 1993 Oro died after an in ring accident. Which led to CMLL abandoning the Orito character not long after out of respect.<ref name=encilopediaOro>{{cite news|title=Enciclopedia de las Mascaras|work=Oro|location=[[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]|id=Tomo V|page=27|date=December 2007|language=Spanish}}</ref> With Orito gone from the ring Peque<U+00F1>o Bronce, as a character, did not last much longer in CMLL either.

===Sombrita (1994&ndash;2011)===
In April 1994 Teucli was given a new ring character, mask and outfit making his debut as "Sombrita" ("Little shadow"), a ''[[Heel (professional wrestling)|rudo]]'' (wrestling term for those that play the bad guys) version of La Sombra.<ref name=SombritaEncicliopedia/> <ref group=Note>This Sombra is not the same as the current wrestler working as [[La Sombra (wrestler)|La Sombra]], but an older wrestler using the name in the 1990s.</ref> Early in his career as Sombrita he won a ''[[Lucha libre#Luchas de Apuestas|Lucas de Apuestas]]'', or bet match, where the loser of the match would be forced to unmask. He defeated [[M<U+00E1>scara Sagrada Jr.|Aguilar de Acero]], forcing the future M<U+00E1>scara Sagrada Jr. to unmask in front of everyone in the arena.<ref name=SombritaEncicliopedia/><ref name=Halcon56/> On December 13, 2002 Sombrita teamed up with [[Espectrito II|Guerrerito del Futuro]], only to lose to [[Bracito de Oro]] and [[Shockercito]] in the opening match of the 2002 ''[[Sin Piedad (2002)|Sin Piedad]]'' show.<ref name=CMLL2002>{{cite news|title=2002: considerar detr<U+00E1>s|work=Box y Lucha Magazine|id=issue 2593|date=January 19, 2003|language=Spanish}}</ref> Sombrita appeared on the [[CMLL 72nd Anniversary Show]] that took place on September 16, 2005 where he teamed up with [[Peque<U+00F1>o Violencia]] and [[Pierrothito]], losing to the trio of [[Bam Bam (wrestler)|Bam Bam]], [[Peque<U+00F1>o Ol<U+00ED>mpico]] and [[<U+00DA>ltimo Dragoncito]].<ref name=Ovaciones20998>{{cite news | author = Arturo Rosas Plata | title = Las celebraciones pasadas... | url = http://itecor.v1.myvirtualpaper.com/28092007/2007092801/en/?page=18 | work =Ovaciones | publisher = Editorial Ovaciones, S.

Sombrita was the first man eliminated as he was pined by Bracito de Oro.<ref name=PequenoReyes07>{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/emll/pequeno.html2007 | title= Peque<U+00F1>o Reyes del Aire 2007 | date= July 13, 2007| accessdate= October 8, 2010 | publisher= Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> In September 2008 CMLL reintroduced the [[Mexican National Lightweight Championship]], promoting it in the ''Mini-Estrella's'' division as a secondary title along with the [[CMLL World Mini-Estrella Championship]]. Sombrita entered the tournament for the vacant championship, but did not make it past the qualifying ''[[torneo cibernetico]]'' elimination match on September 16, 2008.<ref name=Ciber2>{{cite web | url=http://www.oem.com.mx/esto/notas/n854769.htm | title=Wagner se reivindica "en su casa" | author=Mario Licona | date=September 17, 2009 | accessdate=July 11, 2009 | publisher= ESTO, OEM online | language=Spanish}}</ref> After making only sporadic appearances for a year or two Sombrita competed in an ''[[Infierno en el Ring]]'' [[Steel cage match]] where the last man in the cage would be forced to unmask. The match also included Asturiano, [[Bracito de Oro]], [[Electrico (wrestler)|El<U+00E9>ctrico]], [[Fantasy (Mini-Estrella)|Fantasy]], [[Mascarita Dorada]], [[Peque<U+00F1>o Black Warrior]], [[Toshiya Matsuzaki|Peque<U+00F1>o Ninja]], [[Peque<U+00F1>o Ol<U+00ED>mpico]], [[Peque<U+00F1>o Universo 2000]], [[Pierrothito]], Sauron, [[Tzuki]] and [[<U+00DA>ltimo Dragoncito]]. In the end the match came down to Sombrita and Mascarita Dorada, with Dorada pinning his opponent to win the match. Following the match Sombrita was forced to remove his mask and state his birth name as per the ''Luchas de Apuestas'' stipulations.<ref name=Apuesta/> The mask loss would be Teucli last match in CMLL, wrestling only a few sporadic matches on the Mexican [[Independent circuit]] before his retirement in 2011.
