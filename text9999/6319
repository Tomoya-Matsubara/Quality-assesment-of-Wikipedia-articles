==History==
J.C.F Siemer was a brick mason who immigrated to Davenport from the German states of [[Schleswig-Holstein]].  The house is attributed to him and was constructed in 1865.<ref name=qcmemory/>  The building has had various owners and occupants over the years and in the later part of its existence it was part of a used car lot.  

==Architecture==
The Siemer House was a two-story brick building on a stone foundation.  This late Victorian structure featured details that evoked the [[Italianate]] style: a bracketed metal [[cornice]], tall, narrow profile of the [[fenestration]],  and the centralized entrance.<ref name=qcmemory/>  The windows were symmetrically placed on the [[fa<U+00E7>ade]] with five on the second floor and two flanking the entrance.  The windows were surrounded by small wooden headers and sills.
