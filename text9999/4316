The '''Ray-Ban Wayfarer''' is a design of [[sunglasses]] manufactured by [[Ray-Ban]] since 1952, when their design was a revolutionary break from the metal eyewear of the past.  Wayfarers enjoyed early popularity in the 1950s and 1960s, especially after they were worn by [[Audrey Hepburn]] in the 1961 movie ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's]]''. Though the sunglasses had faded from the limelight by the 1970s, a lucrative 1982 [[product placement]] deal brought Wayfarers to their height of popularity.  Since the mid-2000s, the sunglasses have been enjoying a revival.  Wayfarers are sometimes cited as the best-selling design of sunglasses in history<ref>Hirschlag, Jennifer (citing Ray-Ban's brand director, Marcello Favagrossa).

==1990s decline and 2001 redesign==

In the 1990s, the frames again became unpopular.<ref name=rushton/> The 1950s revival that fueled the glasses' popularity in the 1980s had lost steam, and Wayfarers were outcompeted by wraparound frames.<ref name=rushton/>  In 2001, the Wayfarer underwent a significant redesign, with the frames made smaller and less angular, and changed from [[acetate]] to a lighter [[Injection molding|injected plastic]].<ref name=rushton/>  The changes were intended to update the frames' style during a period of unpopularity and to make them easier to wear (the frames' previous tilt made them impossible to perch on top of one's head, for instance).<ref name=rushton/>  According to an eyewear boutique owner commenting in ''[[The Independent]]'' in 2007, however, the design was "diluted" and "horrible."<ref name=rushton/>
