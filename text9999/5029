'''Maxim Gorky''' ({{lang-ru|<U+041C><U+0430><U+043A><U+0441><U+0438><U+043C> <U+0413><U+043E><U+0440><U+044C><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439>}}) was a Project 26bis {{sclass|Kirov|cruiser}} of the [[Soviet Navy]] that saw action  during [[World War II]] and continued in service into the [[Cold War]].

The ship<U+2019>s bow was blown-off by a [[naval mine|mine]] in the [[Gulf of Riga]] during the opening stages of [[Operation Barbarossa]], but she made it to [[Kronstadt]] for repairs.  However, after being repaired, the ship was trapped in harbour for most of the war, by Axis minefields at [[Leningrad]] and Kronstadt.

Despite being trapped, the '''Maxim Gorky''' was active in two engagements:  the ship provided gunfire in support for the defenders, during the [[Siege of Leningrad]], and she later bombarded Finnish positions during the [[Vyborg<U+2013>Petrozavodsk Offensive]] in mid-1944. She saw no further action in World War II.

A major modernization was begun in 1953, but the Navy reconsidered the cost-effectiveness of the refit and work was cancelled in 1955. The Gorky was sold for scrap in 1959.

==Description==
''Maxim Gorky'' was {{convert|187|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]], and {{convert|191.4|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]]. She had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|17.66|m|ftin|sp=us}} and had a [[draft (hull)|draft]] between {{convert|5.87|to|6.3|m|ftin|sp=us}}. She displaced {{convert|8177|t|LT|sp=us}} at standard load and {{convert|9728|t|LT|sp=us}} at full load.<ref name=y4>Yakubov and Worth, p. 84</ref> Her [[steam turbine]]s produced a total of {{convert|129750|shp|kW|lk=on}} during her [[sea trial]]s and propelled the ship to a maximum speed of {{convert|36.72|knots|lk=on}}. This was barely short of her designed speed of 37 knots and was because she was over {{convert|900|t|LT|0}} overweight. She normally carried {{convert|650|t|LT|sp=us}} of [[fuel oil]], {{convert|1660|t|LT|sp=us}} at full load and {{convert|1750|t|LT|sp=us}} at overload. This gave her an endurance of {{convert|4220|nmi|lk=on}} at {{convert|18|knots}}.<ref name=y4>Yakubov and Worth, p. 90</ref>

''Maxim Gorky'' carried nine {{convert|180|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} 57-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] B-1-P guns in three electrically powered MK-3-180 triple turrets.<ref name=y4/> Her secondary armament consisted of six single {{convert|100|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} 56-calibre B-34 [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] guns fitted on each side of the rear funnel. Her light anti-aircraft guns consisted of nine semi-automatic [[45 mm anti-aircraft gun (21-K)|{{convert|45|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} 21-K]] guns and four [[DShK]] {{convert|12.7|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} machine guns.<ref name=y67>Yakubov and Worth, pp. 86-7</ref> Six {{convert|533|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} 39-Yu torpedo tubes were fitted in two triple mountings.<ref name=y8>Yakubov and Worth, p. 88</ref>

===Wartime modifications===
By 1944 ''Maxim Gorky'' had exchanged her 45&nbsp;mm guns for 15 fully automatic [[37 mm automatic air defence gun M1939 (61-K)|37&nbsp;mm 70-K]] AA guns with one thousand rounds per gun, two extra DsHK machine guns and two quadruple [[Lend-Lease]] [[Vickers .50 machine gun]] MK III mounts.<ref name=y67/>

When war broke out in 1941 ''Maxim Gorky'' lacked [[radar]], but she was equipped with British [[Lend-Lease]] radar by 1944. One [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 291|Type 291]] was used for air search. One [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 284|Type 284]] and two [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 285|Type 285]] radars were for main battery fire control, while anti-aircraft fire control was provided by two [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 282|Type 282]] radars.<ref name=y8/>

==Service==
''Maxim Gorky'' was laid down at the [[Baltic Shipyard|Ordzhonikidze Yard]], [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] on 20 December 1936 as a slightly improved version, Project 26bis as designated by the Soviets, of the first pair of ''Kirov''-class cruisers, which were called Project 26. She was launched on 30 April 1938 and was completed on 12 December 1938. The ship, and her escorts, ran into the German-laid "Apolda" [[minefield]] in the [[Gulf of Riga]] while providing cover for Soviet defensive mining efforts on 23 June 1941 and ''Maxim Gorky'' and the destroyer ''Gnevny'' both lost their bows, although ''Gorky'' made it to port where temporary repairs were made. The ship was transferred, with assistance, to [[Tallinn]] and later to [[Kronstadt]].<ref>Rohwer, pp. 81-2</ref> She had a new bow section fabricated at Kronstadt and it was mated with the ship on 21 July.<ref>Yakubov and Worth, p. 93</ref> For most of the rest of the war she was blockaded in Leningrad and Kronstadt by [[Axis powers|Axis]] minefields and could only provide gunfire support for the defenders during the [[Siege of Leningrad]], for example she fired 285 180&nbsp;mm shells on 4 September 1941 and 701 rounds during the [[Krasnoye Selo<U+2013>Ropsha Offensive]] in January 1944. She also bombarded Finnish positions during the Soviet [[Vyborg<U+2013>Petrozavodsk Offensive]] in June 1944. ''Maxim Gorky'' was repeatedly, if lightly, damaged by German air and artillery attacks, but her only extended refit occurred over the winter of 1942<U+2014>43 when her upper deck was reinforced with 37-millimetre armour plates.<ref name=Y3>Yakubov and Worth, pp. 91, 93</ref>

==Postwar career==
''Maxim Gorky'' tested the first Soviet naval [[helicopter]], the [[Kamov Ka-10]] in December 1950 and began her refit in mid-1953. This was planned to include a complete overhaul of her machinery while her radar, fire-control systems and anti-aircraft guns were to be replaced by the latest Soviet systems. [[Anti-torpedo bulge|Torpedo bulges]] were to be fitted which would increase her displacement by {{convert|1000|t|LT|sp=us}}, with consequent penalties to her speed and range. The navy re-evaluated the scope of the work in 1955 and deemed it insufficient to create a fully modern ship and suspended the refit. ''Maxim Gorky'' was sold for [[ship breaking|scrapping]] on 18 April 1959 after the navy had decided that she wasn't needed as a missile-test ship.<ref name=Y3/>
