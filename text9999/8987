'''Masten Space Systems''' is an aerospace startup company in [[Mojave, California]] (formerly [[Santa Clara, California]]) that is developing a line of [[VTOL|Vertical Take-Off and Landing]] (VTOL) spacecraft initially for unmanned research flights and eventually intended to support manned spaceflight.

== Overview ==

Masten Space Systems is a Mojave, California based rocket company that is currently developing a line of reusable VTOL spacecraft, and related rocket propulsion hardware.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Masten Space Systems competed in the NASA and Northrop Grumman [[Lunar Lander Challenge]] X Prize in 2009, qualifying for the level one second prize of $150,000 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/offices/ipp/innovation_incubator/centennial_challenges/cc_masten_level_1_prt.htm|date=October 8, 2009|title=Masten Space Systems Qualifies for Level One Prize in Lunar Lander Challenge}}</ref> and the level two first prize of $1,000,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thelaunchpad.xprize.org/2009/10/masten-qualifies-for-1-million-prize.html|title=Masten Qualifies for $1 Million Prize|date=October 30, 2009}}</ref> On November 2, 2009 it was announced that Masten Space Systems had won first place in the level two category, with [[Armadillo Aerospace]] coming in second.<ref name="nasa-llc-pr-200911">{{Cite press release

== The XA Line of VTVL Suborbital Vehicles ==

The XA (eXtreme Altitude) line of suborbital [[VTOL|Vertical Take-Off and Landing]] (VTOL) vehicles is a family of incrementally developed vehicles.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

=== XA-0.1B ===

After the tethered flight mishap that led to XA-0.1 being retired, MSS recognized that a few of the important goals of XA-0.1 had not been achieved, most particularly demonstration of stable, controlled flight.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The primary goal of these two airframes was to demonstrate stable, controlled flight using a [[Guidance, Navigation and Control|GN&C]] system developed in-house at MSS.  XA-0.1B originally featured four engines with {{convert|1,000|lbf|kN|sigfig=1}} thrust, but was converted in Spring 2009 to be powered by one engine of {{convert|750|lbf|kN|sigfig=1}} thrust.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://masten-space.com/blog/?p=266|title=Post Space Access Technical Update|last=Goff|first=Jonathan|date=April 17, 2009}}</ref>

XA-0.1B - nicknamed "Xombie" - first flew free of tether September 19, 2009 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://masten-space.com/blog/?p=345|title=First Successful Free Flight|last=Mealling|first=Michael|date=September 19, 2009}}</ref> and qualified for the [[Lunar Lander Challenge]] Level One second prize of $150,000 on October 7, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/offices/ipp/innovation_incubator/centennial_challenges/cc_masten_level_1_prt.htm|title=Masten Space Systems Qualifies for Level One Prize in Lunar Lander Challenge|date=October 8, 2009}}</ref>

=== XA-0.1E ===

XA-0.1E has an aluminum frame and features a version of Masten's {{convert|750|lbf|kN|sigfig=1}} thrust engine that produces around {{convert|1000|lbf|kN|sigfig=1}} of thrust. "Xoie" - as the craft is nicknamed - qualified for the Lunar Lander Challenge level two on October 30, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thelaunchpad.xprize.org/2009/10/masten-qualifies-for-1-million-prize.html|title=Masten Qualifies for $1 Million Prize; Unreasonable Rocket Completes 1st Attempt|date=October 30, 2009}}</ref>

=== Commercial Flight ===

Masten Space System's [[Michael Mealling]] announced that Masten Space Systems plans to offer "low altitude" commercial flights in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://masten-space.com/blog/?p=485|title=Masten Space Systems Qualifies for $1,000,000 Prize|last=Mealling|first=Michael|date=October 30, 2009}}</ref> Masten Space Systems is currently offering payload space for sale on their website.

==Other products and services==

In addition to its eXtreme Altitude line of vehicles, Masten Space Systems is currently offering its internally developed igniters and engines commercially to interested and qualified parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://masten-space.com/products-hardware.html|title=Masten Space Systems Products|date=November 1, 2009}}</ref>
