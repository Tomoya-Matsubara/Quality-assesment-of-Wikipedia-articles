The '''Kinzua Bridge''' or the '''Kinzua Viaduct''' ({{pron-en|k<U+026A>nzu<U+02D0>}} or {{IPAlink-en|k<U+026A>nzu<U+02D0><U+0252>}})  was a [[Rail transport in the United States|railroad]] [[trestle]] that had spanned [[Kinzua Creek]] in [[McKean County, Pennsylvania|McKean County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]]. The bridge was {{convert|301|ft}} tall and {{convert|2052|ft}} long prior to its collapse.

The bridge was originally built from iron in 1882 and was billed as the "[[Eighth Wonder of the World]]", holding the record as the tallest railroad bridge in the world for two years. In 1900 the bridge was dismantled and simultaneously rebuilt out of steel to allow it to accommodate heavier trains. It stayed in commercial service until 1959 and was sold to the [[Government of Pennsylvania|state government of Pennsylvania]] in 1963, becoming the centerpiece of a state park.  Restoration of the bridge began in 2002, but before it was finished, a tornado struck the bridge in 2003 causing a large portion of the bridge to collapse. Contributing to the collapse was the failure, caused by corrosion, of the anchor bolts holding the bridge towers to their foundations.

Before its collapse, the Kinzua Bridge was ranked as the fourth tallest railway bridge in the United States.<ref name="trains">{{cite journal| journal=[[Trains (magazine)|Trains]] |month=October |year=2003 |volume=63 |issue=10 |page=25 |title=Tornado Tears Down Historic ''Kinzua Viaduct''}}</ref> It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1977 and as a [[List of historic civil engineering landmarks|National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark]] in 1982. The Kinzua Bridge is in [[Kinzua Bridge State Park]] off of [[U.S. Route 6 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 6]] near the [[Borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] of [[Mount Jewett, Pennsylvania]].

== Construction == 
In 1882, [[Thomas L. Kane]], president of the [[Erie Railroad#New York, Lake Erie and Western Railway: 1875-1893|New York, Lake Erie and Western Railway]] (NYLE&W), was faced with the challenge of building a [[branch line]] off the [[main line (railway)|main line]] in Pennsylvania, from [[Bradford, Pennsylvania|Bradford]] south to the coal fields in [[Elk County, Pennsylvania|Elk County]].<ref name="dvd">{{cite video |people=Linda Devlin (Producer) |title=Tracks across the sky |publisher=Allegheny National Forest Vacation Bureau |year=2004 |location=[[Bradford, Pennsylvania|Bradford, PA]] |oclc=57046003 |medium=[[DVD]]}}</ref><ref name="NYT">{{cite news |title=Removal of Kinzua Viaduct |date=August 21, 1890 |work=[[The New York Times|New York Times]] |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9907E4DF103BE533A25752C2A96E9C94619ED7CF |accessdate=January 28, 2009}}</ref> The fastest way to do so was to build a bridge to cross the [[Kinzua Creek|Kinzua Valley]]. The only other alternative to building a bridge would have been to lay an additional {{convert|8|mi}} of track over rough terrain.<ref name="DCNR"/> When built, the bridge was larger than any that had been attempted, and over twice as large as the largest similar structure: the Portage Bridge over the [[Genesee River]] in [[upstate New York]].<ref name="NRHP"/>

The first Kinzua Bridge was built by a crew of 40 from {{convert|1552|ST|lk=on}} of [[wrought iron]] in just 94 working days, between May 10 and August 29, 1882.<ref name="ASCE">{{cite web |publisher=[[American Society of Civil Engineers]] |title=Kinzua Railway Viaduct |work=History and Heritage of Civil Engineering |accessdate=October 2, 2007 |url=http://live.asce.org/hh/index.mxml?lid=102}}</ref><ref name="NRHP"/><ref name="post">{{cite news |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|Pittsburgh Post&ndash;Gazette]] |author=[[Associated Press]] |date=July 22, 2003 |title=High Winds Topple Historic Railroad Bridge |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/localnews/20030722kinzuar5.asp |accessdate=October 3, 2007}}</ref> The reason for the short construction time was that [[scaffolding]] was not used in the bridge's construction; instead a [[wiktionary:gin pole|gin pole]] was used to build the first tower, then a traveling crane was built atop it and used in building the second tower.<ref name="NRHP"/><ref name="tracks"/> The process was then repeated across all 20&nbsp;towers.<ref name="dvd"/>

The bridge was designed by the engineer [[Octave Chanute]] and was built by the [[Phoenix Iron Works]], which specialized in producing patented, hollow iron tubes called "Phoenix columns".<ref name="dvd"/> Because of the design of these columns, it was often mistakenly believed that the bridge had been built out of wooden poles.<ref name="tracks"/> The bridge's 110 [[sandstone]] masonry piers were quarried from the hillside used for the foundation of the bridge.<ref name="ASCE"/><ref name="dvd"/> The tallest tower had a base that was {{convert|193|ft}} wide.<ref name="ASCE"/> The bridge was designed to support a load of {{convert|266|ST}},<ref name="NYT"/> and cost [[United States Dollar|$]]167,000 (or ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|167000|1882}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars).<ref name="NRHP"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Consumer Price Index (Estimate) 1800&ndash;2008 |publisher=[[Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis]] |url=http://www.minneapolisfed.org/community_education/teacher/calc/hist1800.cfm |accessdate=February 25, 2009}}</ref>

== Reconstruction and use ==
In 1893 the NYLE&W went bankrupt and was merged with the [[Erie Railroad]], which became the owner of the bridge.<ref name="marker"/> By the start of the 20th&nbsp;century locomotives were almost 85&nbsp;percent heavier, and the iron bridge could no longer safely carry trains.<ref name="ASCE"/> The last traffic crossed the old bridge on May 14, 1900, and removal of the old iron began on May 24. Construction on the new steel bridge began on May 26, starting from both ends. Two [[Truss bridge#Howe truss|Howe Truss]] "timber travelers", each {{convert|180|ft}} long and {{convert|16|ft}} deep, were used to build the new bridge.<ref name="NRHP"/> Each traveler was supported by two of the original towers on the opposite sides of a third original tower that was to be demolished. After the middle tower had been removed, construction of a new steel replacement tower and the spans adjoining it took one week. Then the traveler would move, and the next tower would be taken down and replaced.<ref name="NRHP">{{cite web |last=Packard |first=Vance |publisher=[[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]] |date=January 25, 1977 |title=National Register of Historic Places &mdash; Nomination Form |url=http://www.arch.state.pa.us/pdfs/H000610_01B.pdf |accessdate=April 24, 2008 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}</ref>

Train crews would sometimes play a trick on a [[brakeman]] on his first journey on the line. When the train was a short distance from the bridge, the crew would send the brakeman over the rooftops of the cars to check on a small supposed problem. As the train crossed the bridge, the rookie "suddenly found himself terrified, staring down three hundred feet [91&nbsp;m] from the roof of a rocking boxcar".<ref name="marker"/> Even after being reconstructed the bridge still had a speed limit of {{convert|5|mph}}. As the bridge aged, heavy trains pulled by two steam locomotives had to stop so the engines could cross the bridge one at a time. Diesel locomotives were lighter and did not face this limit; the bridge was last used by a steam engine on October 5, 1950.<ref name="marker"/> 

The Erie Railroad obtained [[Arrangements between railroads#Trackage rights|trackage rights]] on the nearby [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) line in the late 1950s, which allowed it to bypass the aging Kinzua Bridge. Regular commercial service ended on June 21, 1959, and the Erie sold the bridge to the Kovalchick Salvage Company of [[Indiana, Pennsylvania]], for $76,000.<ref name="USA"/> The bridge was reopened for one day in October 1959 when a wreck on the B&O line forced trains to be rerouted across the bridge.<ref name="marker"/> According to the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]], the Kinzua Bridge "was a critical structure in facilitating the transport of coal from Northwestern Pennsylvania to the Eastern Great Lakes region, and is credited with causing an increase in coal mining that led to significant economic growth."<ref name="ASCE"/>

== Destruction ==
[[File:July 21 2003 Pennsylvania mesocyclone.gif|thumb|Radar loop of the storm over northern Pennsylvania]]
On July 21, 2003, a [[tornado]] struck the Kinzua Bridge, snapping and uprooting nearby trees, as well as causing 11 of the 20 bridge towers to collapse. The tornado was produced by a [[mesoscale convective system]] (MCS), a complex of strong thunderstorms, that had formed over an area that included eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, western New York, and southern [[Ontario]].<ref name="civil">{{cite journal |last=Leech |first=Thomas G |coauthors=et al. |title=Lessons from the Kinzua |date=November 2005 |journal=Civil Engineering |publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers |pages=56&ndash;61 |issn=0885-7024}}</ref> The MCS traveled east at around {{convert|40|mph|km/h}}. As the MCS crossed northwestern Pennsylvania, it formed into a distinctive [[comma]] shape (something that usually happens after the formation of a [[bow echo]]). The northern portion of the MCS contained a "long&ndash;lived" [[mesocyclone]], and while mesocyclones are not often associated with tornadic activity, they can sometimes produce tornadoes.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Meteorological Report |journal=Report on the July 21st collapse of the Kinzua Viaduct |publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University]] |last=Markowski |first=Paul |date=December 2003 |format=PDF |url=http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/info/kinzuabridgereport/app/appb.pdf |accessdate=January 29, 2009}}</ref> 

At approximately 15:20 [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]] (20:20 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), the tornado touched down in Kinzua Bridge State Park, {{convert|1|mi}} from the Kinzua Bridge. The tornado, classified as F1 on the [[Fujita scale]], passed by the bridge and continued another {{convert|2.5|mi}} before it lifted. It touched down again {{convert|2|mi}} from [[Smethport, Pennsylvania|Smethport]] and traveled another {{convert|3|mi}} before finally dissipating. It was estimated to have been {{convert|1/3|mi|1|adj=on}} wide and it left a path {{convert|3.5|mi}} long.<ref>{{cite web |title=Event Record Details |publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]] |date=July 21, 2003 |url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~513297 |accessdate=January 28, 2009}}</ref> The same storm also spawned an F3 tornado in nearby [[Potter County, Pennsylvania|Potter County]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Event Record Details |publisher=National Climatic Data Center |date=July 21, 2003 |url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~513309 |accessdate=January 28, 2009}}</ref>

When the tornado touched down, the winds had increased to at least {{convert|94|mph|km/h}} and were coming from the east, perpendicular to the bridge, which ran north-south. An investigation determined that Towers 10 and 11 had collapsed first, in a westerly direction.<ref name="initiation">{{cite journal |url=http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/info/kinzuabridgereport/body/001.html |author=Gannett Fleming |date=December 2003 |title=Initiation of Failure |journal=Report on the July 21st collapse of the Kinzua Viaduct |accessdate=February 13, 2009 |publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources}}</ref> Meanwhile, Towers 12 through 14 had actually been picked up off of their foundations, moved slightly to the northwest and set back down intact and upright, held together by only the railroad tracks on the bridge.

The failures were caused by the badly rusted base bolts holding the bases of the towers to concrete anchor blocks embedded into the ground.<ref name="DCNR"/> An investigation determined that the tornado had a wind speed of at least {{convert|94|mph}}, which applied an estimated {{convert|90|STf|kN|lk=on}} of lateral force on to the bridge.<ref name="mechanics">{{cite journal |url=http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/info/kinzuabridgereport/body/009.html |author=Gannett Fleming |date=December 2003 |title=Mechanics of Collapse |journal=Report on the July 21st collapse of the Kinzua Viaduct |accessdate=January 29, 2009 |publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources}}</ref>  The investigation also hypothesized that the whole structure oscillated laterally 4 to 5 times before [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] started to cause the base bolts to fail.
