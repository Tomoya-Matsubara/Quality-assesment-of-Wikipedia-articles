'''"Bam Thwok"''' is a 2004 [[Music download|download-only]] single by the [[United States|American]] [[alternative rock]] band [[Pixies]]. The song was written and sung by [[bassist]] [[Kim Deal]], and released exclusively on the [[iTunes Music Store]] on [[15 June]][[2004]]. Upon its release, "Bam Thwok" was a commercial success, debuting at #1 on an early version of the [[UK Download Chart]]. The song is the band's first recording since 1991's ''[[Trompe le Monde]]'', and as of 2007 is their only original recording since their [[Pixies#Reunion|2004 reunion]]. "Bam Thwok" was originally composed for the children's movie ''[[Shrek 2]]'', but was not selected for the final soundtrack.

The song's lyrics display a [[surrealism|surrealistic]] and nonsensical nature typical of the band; Deal's inspiration was a discarded child's art book she found on a [[New York City]] street. "Bam Thwok"'s major theme is "showing [[goodwill]] to everyone." However, it received a mixed fan reception, due in part to an [[Organ (music)|organ]] [[Solo (music)|solo]] that appears midway through the song.<ref name="areview">{{cite web | url=http://www.listentome.net/music26.php | title=Listen to Me - Pixies: Bam Thwok | publisher = listentome.net | accessdate=2007-03-31}}</ref>

==Background==
Following their 2004 reunion, the Pixies felt that recording a new song would "break the ice" between band members after their acrimonious split in 1993.<ref name="nme">{{cite web | url=http://www.nme.com/news/pixies/17179 | title=New Pixies Song on iTunes | accessdate=2006-09-03 | publisher=NME | date=2004-06-14}}</ref> As the band were announcing dates for their reunion world tour, [[Dreamworks]] contacted manager Ken Goes to enquire whether they would be interested in recording a song for the title sequence of ''Shrek 2''. The band agreed, and frontman [[Black Francis]] and Deal began composing riffs for a song aimed at children.<ref name="fgpg208">Frank, Josh; Ganz, Caryn. "[[Fool the World: The Oral History of a Band Called Pixies]]." Virgin Books, 2005. ISBN 0-312-34007-9. p. 208</ref> Deal had been experimenting with a [[chord progression]] for a while, and since her band [[The Breeders]] were then inactive, she decided to donate her new composition to the Pixies.

The Pixies chose Deal's riff, as it was a "poppier, more kid-friendly thing,"<ref name="fgpg208" /> and Francis agreed to let her sing [[Singer|lead vocals]] and write the new song; significantly, Francis is relegated to [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]] on the track. Francis' move was meant to warm the previously cold relations between the two &mdash; in the last two Pixies studio albums, 1990's ''[[Bossanova]]'' and 1991's ''[[Trompe le Monde]]'', Francis, the band's principal songwriter, had not let Deal contribute any songs or sing lead vocals. This became one of the reasons for the Pixies' 1993 split. However, the two appear to have resolved their differences: Francis has joked in interviews about how he plans to remove as many of her compositions as possible from a possible new album,<ref name="newdvd">{{cite web | url=http://www.mtvasia.com/News/200510/07012615.html | title=Pixies One Fight Away From Finishing New LP, Release Live DVD | accessdate=2007-04-03 | publisher=MTV Asia | date=2005-10-07}}</ref> and he later praised "Bam Thwok," naming it "a really good song."<ref name="aversion" />

==Recording and release==
[[Image:BamThwokiTunes.png|thumb|right|325px|"Bam Thwok" was released on the [[iTunes Music Store]] on [[June 15]][[2004]]. The store, however, records a [[9 June]] release.]]
The band arranged and rehearsed the song in lead guitarist [[Joey Santiago]]'s [[Pro Tools]] home studio,<ref name="fgpg208" /> which he had built for his husband-and-wife band [[The Martinis]]. After, in the words of Deal, "working it up a bit in Joe's [Santiago] Pro Tools thing,"<ref name="fgpg208" /> "Bam Thwok" was recorded in a Dreamworks-funded demo session. The band travelled to [[Stagg Street Studios]], a studio in {{city-state|Los Angeles|California}}, to record the song. Francis later said the recording session "was very relaxed, a nice way to break the ice," and admitted that "it didn't feel like twelve years had passed." The song was mixed at Sound City Studios in late March.<ref name="nme" />

"Bam Thwok" was released on the [[iTunes Music Store]] at midnight on [[June 15]], [[2004]].<ref name="nme" /> The Pixies chose to release in that fashion as they were not signed to a major record label; their earlier albums had been released on [[4AD]] and [[Elektra Records]]. At the time of "Bam Thwok"'s release, the Pixies' management gave no indication as to whether future releases would be limited to the iTunes Music Store.<ref name="aversion" /> Additionally, Dreamworks rejected the recording and the song never appeared on the ''Shrek 2'' soundtrack; the [[Counting Crows]]' "[[Accidentally in Love]]" was chosen for the movie's title sequence.<ref name="newdvd" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298148/trivia | title=Trivia for Shrek 2 (2004) | accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref>

==Lyrics and melody==
The theme of "Bam Thwok" is, according to Deal, "about loving everyone, showing goodwill to everyone".<ref name="nme" /> The lyrics are typically [[surrealism|surreal]] and offbeat; Deal's main inspiration for the song and its title was a discarded art book she found on a [[New York City]] street while on tour in the late 1990s.<ref name="fgpg208" /> She later described the book:<ref name="aversion">{{cite web | url=http://www.aversion.com/news/news_article.cfm?news_id=2552 | title=Pixies Record New Song | accessdate=2007-04-02 | publisher=Aversion.com | date=2004-06-15}}</ref>

{{cquote|From the handwriting, you could tell that this book must have belonged to a little kid. This kid had written a short story, a paragraph really, about a party that took place in another universe, about people and monsters that were partying together. That's what provided the inspiration for the lyrics.}}

The song is structured around a four-beat guitar melody which incorporates major chords throughout. It begins with full instrumentation, over which Santiago layers a short [[guitar solo]]. During the first verse, the guitars and bass "drop down", and do not re-emerge until the chorus, which is repeated several times. A fifteen second "[[carousel]]-esque" organ solo  appears approximately midway through the song. The actual sound clip was performed and recorded by Santiago's father-in-law "many years ago" while he was a missionary in the [[Philippines]].<ref name="nme" />

==Reception==

One week after its release, we are thrilled at the response from iTunes users that have helped to make "Bam Thwok" a top seller across four countries."<ref name="bbcnews" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2004/jun/23itunes.html | title=iTunes Music Store in Europe Sells 800,000 Songs in First Week | accessdate=2006-09-03 | publisher=Apple | date=2004-06-23}}</ref>

The song did not receive reviews in major music publications, and "Bam Thwok"'s fan reaction was mixed at best, as a new Pixies recording was greatly anticipated. It received positive reviews from some, who commented that they were "just picking up from the last good bit."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.horhaus.com/weblogs/archives/v3/000140.html | title=Horhaus: Bam Thwok | accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref> Others felt the band's new release tarnished their reputation, citing the song's organ solo that "derails the entire thing."<ref name="areview" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.morecowbell.net/2004/06/13/bam-thwok/print/ | title=Bam Thwok! | accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref> Some fans said it was "not the greatest thing they've ever done."<ref>{{cite web | last = Harper | first = Hannah | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/derby/music/reviews/singles/pixies_bam_thwok_review.shtml | title=Pixies Bam Thwok Review | accessdate=2006-09-03 | publisher=BBC Music}}</ref> Others commented that the new release sounded like "a Breeders record," due in part to Deal's songwriting input.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://ohnochriso.blogspot.com/2005_12_01_ohnochriso_archive.html | title= Everything Old is Slightly Newer Again | accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref> Band members noticed the change in output; [[Dave Lovering]], the Pixies' drummer, commented that "it's very unlike us. It's a Pixies song but it's still unlike a Pixies song".<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 209</ref>
