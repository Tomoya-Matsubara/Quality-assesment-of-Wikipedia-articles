The '''Forksville Covered Bridge''' is a [[Burr Truss|Burr arch truss]] [[covered bridge]] over [[Loyalsock Creek]] in the borough of [[Forksville, Pennsylvania|Forksville]], [[Sullivan County, Pennsylvania|Sullivan County]], in the U.S. state of [[Pennsylvania]]. It was built in 1850 and is {{convert|152|ft|11|in}} in length. The bridge was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The Forksville bridge is named for the borough it is in, which is named for its location at the [[confluence (geography)|confluence]] or "forks" of the [[Little Loyalsock Creek|Little Loyalsock]] and Loyalsock Creeks.

Pennsylvania had the first covered bridge in the United States, and the most such bridges in both the 19th and 21st centuries. They were a transition between stone and metal bridges, with the roof and sides protecting the wooden structure from weather. The Forksville bridge is a Burr arch truss type, with a [[Structural engineering|load-bearing]] [[arch]] sandwiching multiple vertical [[Truss#King_post_truss|king posts]], for strength and rigidity. The building of the Forksville bridge was supervised by the 18-year-old Sadler Rogers, who used his hand-carved model of the structure. It served as the site of a [[stream gauge]] from 1908 to 1913 and is still an official Pennsylvania state highway bridge. The United States [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] [[Federal Highway Administration]] uses it as the model of a covered bridge "classic [[gable]] roof",<ref name = "FHA"/> and it serves as the [[logo]] of a Pennsylvania insurance company.<!-- Unfortunately there is no reason given as to why it is used as the model of a classic gable roof in the US DOT FHA reference.  -->

The bridge was restored in 1970 and 2004 and is still in use, with average daily traffic of 217 vehicles in 2006. Despite the restorations, as of 2006 the bridge structure's sufficiency rating on the [[National Bridge Inventory]] was only 17.4&nbsp;percent and its condition was deemed "basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action".<ref name="national bridges"/> It is one of three remaining covered bridges in Sullivan County, and according to Susan M. Zacher's ''The Covered Bridges of Pennsylvania: A Guide'', its location "over the rocky Loyalsock Creek" is "one of the most attractive settings in the state."<ref name = "zacher"/>

==Overview==
The covered bridge is in the borough of Forksville on Bridge Street, a spur of State Route&nbsp;4012, just west of [[Pennsylvania Route 154]].

==History==
===Background===
The first covered bridge in the United States was built in 1800 over the [[Schuylkill River]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. According to Zacher, the first covered bridges of the Burr arch truss design were also built in the state. Pennsylvania is estimated to have once had at least 1,500 covered bridges and is believed to have had the most in the country between 1830 and 1875.<ref name = "three counties">{{cite web | url = http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/64000708.pdf | title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Covered Bridges of Bradford, Sullivan and Lycoming Counties | accessdate = 2008-04-14 | author = Susan M. Zacher, Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission | format = PDF }}</ref> In 2001, Pennsylvania had more surviving historic covered bridges than any other state, with 221 remaining in 40 of its 67 counties.<ref name = "evans"/>

Covered bridges were a transition between stone and metal bridges, the latter made of cast-iron or steel. In 19th-century Pennsylvania, lumber was an abundant resource for bridge construction,<ref name = "three counties"/> but did not last long when exposed to the elements. The roof and enclosed sides of covered bridges protected the structural elements, allowing some of these bridges to survive for well over a century. A Burr arch truss consists of a [[Structural engineering|load-bearing]] [[arch]] sandwiching multiple [[Truss#King_post_truss|king posts]], resulting in stronger and more rigid structure than one made of either element alone.<ref name = "evans"/>

===Construction and description===
Although there were 30&nbsp;covered bridges in Sullivan County in 1890, only five were left by 1954, and as of 2008 only three remain: Forksville, [[Hillsgrove Covered Bridge|Hillsgrove]], and [[Sonestown Covered Bridge|Sonestown]]. All three are Burr arch truss covered bridges and were built in 1850.<ref name = "arch"/><ref name = "evans"/> The Forksville Covered Bridge was built for Sullivan County by Sadler Rogers (or Rodgers), a native of Forksville who was only 18 at the time. He hand-carved a model<!--you don't happen to know its dimensions? Would be interesting to know whether a meter long or hand-held, so the readers can visualise it--> of the bridge before work began and used it to supervise construction.<ref name = "arch"/><ref name = "industry">{{cite book | title = Sullivan County Industries: Now and Then | year = 1954 | publisher = The Endicott Printing Company |location = Endicott, New York |url = http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pasulliv/SullivanCountyHistoricalSociety/SullivanIndustries.htm}}</ref> Rogers built the Forksville and Hillsgrove bridges across Loyalsock Creek, with the latter about {{convert|5|mi}} downstream of the former.<ref name = "arch"/><ref name = "evans"/> Although most sources do not list the builder of the Sonestown bridge, a 1997 newspaper article on the remaining Sullivan County covered bridges reported that Rodgers had designed it also.<ref name="three">{{cite news |first= Mollie |last= Eliot |title= Sullivan County's Covered Bridges Survive But Their Numbers Are Down From 30&nbsp;to Three Today |publisher= ''Williamsport Sun-Gazette'' |date= December 28, 1997 }}</ref>

The Forksville Covered Bridge was added to the NRHP on July 24, 1980 in a [[National_Register_of_Historic_Places#Multiple_Property_Submission|Multiple Property Submission]] of seven [[Covered Bridges of Bradford, Sullivan and Lycoming Counties]].<ref name = "three counties"/> It was included in the 2006&nbsp;National Bridge Inventory (NBI), which lists the covered bridge as {{convert|152|ft|11|in|m}} long, with a roadway {{convert|12|ft|2|in|m}} wide, and a maximum load of {{convert|3.0|ST|metric_ton|1}}.<ref name="national bridges"/> According to the NRHP, the bridge's "road surface width" is {{convert|15|ft|1}},<ref name="arch"/> which is only sufficient for a single lane of traffic.<ref name="national bridges"/> As of 2008, each portal has a small sign reading "1850 Sadler Rogers" at the top, above a sign with the posted clearance height of {{convert|8.0|ft|1}}, and a "No Trucks Allowed" sign hanging below these.<ref>Note: Follow these links for photographs of the [[:Image:Forksville Covered Bridge West Portal Detail.jpg|1850 and clearance signs]] and [[:Image:Forksville Covered Bridge East Portal and North Side.jpg|all bridge portal signs]].</ref>

The covered bridge rests on the original stone [[abutment]]s, which have since been reinforced with concrete.<ref name= "arch"/> The bridge deck, which is now supported by steel beams, is made of "very narrow crosswise planks".<ref name = "evans"/> Wheel guards on the deck separate the roadway from the pedestrian walkways on either side and protect the sides, which are covered with vertical planks almost to the [[eaves]].<ref name = "arch"/><ref name = "evans"/><ref name ="grit">{{cite news |title= Covered Bridge at Forksville Being Renovated: Old Covered Bridge Just 'Oozing' History |publisher= ''Grit'' (City News Edition) |date= September 13, 1970 }} ''Note'': a photo in the article clearly shows one long side of the bridge without any windows and several boards missing</ref> The bridge has long, narrow windows with wooden shutters: the south side has four windows, and the north side has three.

From 1908 to 1913, there was a [[stream gauge]] on the bridge. Twice a day, the creek height was read on a chain {{convert|21.88|ft|2}} long  on the bridge's upstream side, and [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] measurements were taken on the downstream side.

The Forksville Covered Bridge was restored in 1970 with what the NRHP nomination form describes as "all kinds of odd repairs".<ref name = "arch"/> The restoration work was completed by T. Corbin Lewis of [[Hillsgrove Township, Pennsylvania|Hillsgrove Township]], a retired electrical [[General contractor|contractor]], whose low bid of [[United States dollar|USD$]]48,000&nbsp;was accepted over a [[Baltimore, Maryland]], firm's $185,000 bid. The restoration was supervised by the [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation]] (PennDOT), which owns and maintains the bridge. The repair involved minor work on the "steel floor beams and stringers", which had been added years before.<ref name="grit"/> An entirely new wooden deck was installed, with wheel guards (wooden [[curb (road)|curbs]]) to channel vehicle traffic to the center and to protect the pedestrian walkways on the sides. Windows were cut in the bridge's sides for the first time, and steel girders were "added to support the bridge's understructure."<ref name="grit"/> 

[[Image:Forksville Covered Bridge Window.jpg|thumb|left|View south to Loyalsock Creek out of a window cut in the bridge in 1970]]
Attitudes towards covered bridges in Sullivan County changed considerably in the last half of the 20th century. Two of the five bridges remaining in 1954 were razed by 1970, when PennDOT considered tearing down the Forksville bridge too. It was renovated rather than razed because of its historic nature and appeal to tourists.<ref name="grit"/> The Forksville Covered Bridge was added to the NRHP in 1980, and the [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]] now forbids the destruction of any covered bridge on the NRHP in the state and has to approve any renovation work.<ref name = "phmc">{{cite news |first= Nancy E. |last= Baumgartner |title= Cogan House Covered Bridge Dedication Follows Facelift |publisher= ''[[Williamsport Sun-Gazette]]'' |date= November 1, 1998 }} </ref> 

The NBI says the bridge was "reconstructed" in 2004 but does not give further details.<ref name = "national bridges"/> The entire bridge has been reinforced with steel girders, including vertical beams.<ref name="evans"/> In 2006 the bridge was painted red, which took about three weeks.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dot.state.pa.us/Penndot/Districts/district3.nsf/f99071963d03038c8525692f0041a9ac/47d371c9cbb5e409852572f1004d74c6?OpenDocument |title = Forksville Covered Bridge repainting starts this week; Short detour required |date = June 5, 2006 | publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Transportation | accessdate = 2008-06-06}}</ref>

The bridge's condition was described as "good" in the 1980&nbsp;NRHP form, Zacher's 1994&nbsp;book, and the Evans' 2001&nbsp;book.<ref name = "arch"/><ref name = "zacher"/><ref name = "evans"/> However, the 2006 [[Federal Highway Administration]] [[National Bridge Inventory]] found the sufficiency rating of the bridge structure to be 17.4&nbsp;percent.{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} It found that the bridge's foundations were "determined to be stable for calculated [[Bridge scour|scour]] conditions" but that the railing "does not meet currently acceptable standards".<ref name="national bridges"/> Its overall condition was deemed "basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action", with an estimated cost to improve the bridge of $463,000.<ref name="national bridges"/>

[[Image:Forksville Covered Bridge Southwest.jpg|thumb|right|The east portal and north side of the bridge and general store from PA&nbsp;154]]
Today the Forksville Covered Bridge is heavily used, as it is the most direct and shortest route from PA&nbsp;154, at the eastern end, to Forksville and its [[general store]], which are at the western end.<ref name="evans"/> In 2000, Forksville had 147&nbsp;residents.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFFacts?_event=Search&geo_id=&_geoContext=&_street=&_county=Forksville%2C+PA&_cityTown=Forksville%2C+PA&_state=&_zip=&_lang=en&_sse=on&pctxt=fph&pgsl=010&show_2003_tab=&redirect=Y |title= Fact Sheet: Forksville borough, Pennsylvania | publisher = [[U.S. Census Bureau]] | accessdate = 2008-06-25}}</ref> The posted speed limit is {{convert|15|mph}}, and its average daily traffic was 217&nbsp;vehicles in 2006.<ref name="national bridges"/> The bridge is used as the logo of the Farmers & Mechanics Mutual Insurance Company, which was founded in Sullivan County in 1877.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.fmmutual.com/logo.shtml |title = About our logo | publisher = Farmers & Mechanics Mutual Insurance Company | accessdate = 2008-06-15}}</ref>

In addition to its utility, the bridge is appreciated for its history and beauty. In 1970&nbsp;a long-time Forksville resident spoke of the bridge's connection to the past: "When you stand quiet on the bridge and the woods are still, you can almost hear the horses clomping over the wooden deck as they did in years gone by; you can almost see the youngsters who climbed the rafters of the bridge to 'skinny-dip' in the creek below",<ref name="grit"/> while Zacher's 1994&nbsp;''The Covered Bridges of Pennsylvania: A Guide'' describes the bridge's location "over the rocky Loyalsock Creek" as "one of the most attractive settings in the state."<ref name = "zacher"/>
