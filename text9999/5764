The '''ASM-A-1 Tarzon''', also known as '''VB-13''', was a [[guided bomb]] developed by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] during the late 1940s. Mating the guidance system of the earlier [[Razon]] radio-controlled weapon with a British [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy]] {{convert|12000|lb|adj=on}} bomb, the ASM-A-1 saw brief operational service in the [[Korean War]] before, as a result of safety and cost issues, being withdrawn from service in 1951.

==Design and development==
Development of the VB-13 Tarzon began in February 1945, with [[Bell Aircraft]] being awarded a contract by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] for the development of a very large guided bomb.<ref name="DS">Parsch 2003</ref><ref name="AFM">Stumpf 1998, p.13.</ref> The VB-13 was a combination of a radio-command guidance system as used on the smaller [[VB-3 Razon]] (''''R'''ange And a'''z'''imuth '''on'''ly') guided bomb with the British-developed Tallboy {{convert|12000|lb|adj=on}} "earthquake" bomb,<ref name="DS"/><ref name="CBGM1">Schmitt 2002, p.45.</ref> known to the USAAF as M112.<ref name="WoC4">Gillepsie 2006, p.54.</ref> The 'Tarzon' name was a [[portmanteau]], combining '''Ta'''llboy, '''r'''ange and a'''z'''imuth '''on'''ly, describing the weapon and guidance system.<ref name="WoC4"/><ref name="USAF">NMUSAF Fact Sheet: VB-13 Tarzon Bomb</ref>

The VB-13, redesignated ASM-A-1 in 1948,<ref name="DS"/> was developed under the project code MX-674.<ref name="AFM"/><ref name="Dorr">Dorr 2003, p.31.</ref> It had an [[annular wing]] around the mid-section of its body, mounted near the weapon's [[center of gravity]].<ref name="CBGM1"/> At the rear of the bomb was an octagonal tail surface containing the Razon control surfaces.<ref name="DS"/><ref name="CBGM1"/> Intended to be carryed by the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] medium bomber,{{#tag:ref|Some sources state that eighteen [[Convair B-36|Convair B-36 Peacemaker]] heavy bombers were converted to carry two Tarzons each.<ref>Polmar and Norris 2009, p.93.</ref>|group=N}} the Tarzon bomb used a combination of [[AN/ARW-38]] and [[AN/URW-2]] radio control devices to provide [[MCLOS|manual command guidance]] of [[range]] and [[azimuth]], based on visual tracking of the bomb's course, aided by use of a [[flare]] mounted in the tail of the weapon.<ref name="DS"/><ref name="CBGM1"/> [[Gyroscope]]s on board the ASM-A-1 aided in stabilisation, while a [[pneumatic]] system drove the bomb's control surfaces.<ref name="CBGM1"/> The guidance system was considered effective; Tarzon proved in testing to have an [[Circular error probable|accuracy]] of {{convert|280|ft}}.<ref name="Dorr"/>

In addition to the {{convert|12000|lb}} nominal weight of the Tallboy it was based on, the annular wing and control sufaces boosted the weight of Tarzon by an additional {{convert|1100|lb}}.<ref name="CBGM1"/> As a result, the size and weight of the ASM-A-1 were such that the weapon would not fit inside the bomb bay of a Superfortress; instead, the weapon was carried in a semi-recessed mounting, half the weapon being exposed to the airstream. This increased [[aerodynamic drag|drag]] on the carrying aircraft, in addition to causing [[turbulence|turbulent airflow]] that could affect the handling of the B-29.<ref name="Dorr"/>

==Operational history==
[[File:Tarzon loaded on B-29.png|thumb|left|Tarzon being loaded on a B-29 of the [[19th Bomb Group]]]]
Although the VB-13 project had not reached the testing stage by the end of [[World War II]], it avoided being cancelled, proceeding as a low-priority project.<ref name="DS"/> Limited testing was conducted during 1948 and 1949;<ref name="WoC4"/> additional testing at [[Alamagordo, New Mexico]] in 1950 led to the Tarzon being approved for operational service in the [[Korean War]].<ref>Schmitt 2002, p.46.</ref> 

Tarzon saw its first combat use in December 1950,<ref name="DS"/> the ASM-A-1 replacing the Razon in operational service; the smaller weapon had been determined to be too small for effective use against bridges and other hardened targets.<ref name="Dorr"/><ref name="WoC1">Gillepsie 2006, p.58.</ref> Used solely by the [[19th Bomb Group]], which had previously conducted the Razon's combat missions,<ref name="WoC1"/> the first Tarzon drop in combat took place on December 14, 1950.<ref name="WoC1"/> 

The largest bomb used in combat during the war,<ref name="Dorr"/> Tarzon was used in strikes against [[North Korea]]n bridges and other hardened targets, the Tarzon's improved accuracy over conventional 'dumb bombs' led to the confirmed destruction of at least six high-priority targets during approximately six months of combat use;{{#tag:ref|Most sources state six targets hit; the National Museum of the United States Air Force, however, gives a total of eleven targets hit, with six bridges destroyed and one damaged.<ref name="USAF"/>|group=N}} these included a [[hydroelectric]] plant, proving the effectiveness of guided weapons against conventional targets as well as bridges.<ref name="DS"/><ref name="WoC1"/>

Thirty Tarzon missions were flown between December 1950 and March 1951;<ref name="WoC1"/> the weapon's success led to a contract for the production of 1,000 additional ASM-A-1 missiles.<ref name="WoC2">Gillepsie 2006, p.59.</ref> On March 29, 1951, however, a Tarzon strike against [[Sinuiju]] went awry; the group commander's aircraft was destroyed as a result of the premature detonation of the bomb when, the aircraft suffering mechanical difficulties, the weapon was jettisoned in preparation for [[ditching]].<ref name="DS"/><ref name="WoC2"/><ref name="SaC">''Steadfast and Courageous'', pp.33-34.</ref> The thirtieth, and as it proved final, mission, three weeks following the Sinuiju mission, also suffered an unintentional detonation of a jettisoned, "safed" bomb, although this time without the loss of the aircraft.<ref name="WoC2"/>

An investigation proved that the fault lay in the construction of the bomb's tail; breaking up on impact, a 'safed' bomb would have its arming wire removed, rendering it 'unsafe' and detonating the weapon.<ref name="WoC2"/><ref name="SaC"/> Modifications were made to solve the problem, but the damage had been done; the safety issues,<ref name="WoC3">Gillepsie 2006, p.60.</ref> increased maintenance costs compared to conventional bombs,<ref name="DS"/> the fact that the bomb's guidance system required clear-day use only, rendering the bombers vulnerable to enemy fighters, and required that the weapon be released at a prime altitude for the aircraft to be in danger from enemy [[flak]].<ref name="WoC3"/> These combined with the weapon's poor reliability <U+2013> only six of twenty-eight bombs dropped successfully destroyed their targets<ref name="WoC3"/>{{#tag:ref|While this was unacceptable given the cost of Tarzon, it was ten times better than the results achieved by conventional bombs.<ref>Dunnigan 1996, p.127.</ref>|group=N}} <U+2013> to result in the production order being canceled by the USAF; following this, the Tarzon program as a whole was terminated in August 1951.<ref name="DS"/><ref name="USAF"/><ref name="WoC3"/>
