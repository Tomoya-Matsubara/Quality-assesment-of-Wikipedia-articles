The core principles of the PNV include: [[individual rights]], including the [[right to life]], [[property|private property]] and the [[Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness|pursuit of happiness]] (a clear reference to the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]); the refusal of any discrimination based on race, sex, religion, language, etc.; [[nonviolence]], [[Legitimacy (political)|democratic legitimacy]] and the principle of non aggression; resepect of the [[international law]], the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and especially [[self-determination]]. The party proposes an independent Veneto, "tolerant and open to Europe" and takes example from the [[Scottish National Party]], the [[Basque National Party]], and [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalists]].<ref>http://www.pnveneto.org/2009/03/pnv-la-tua-casa/</ref><ref>http://www.pnveneto.org/about/</ref> The PNV leader Bernardini is essentially a libertarian and the party reflects his political and economic views.<ref>http://www.bu.edu/history/bernardini.pdf</ref>
