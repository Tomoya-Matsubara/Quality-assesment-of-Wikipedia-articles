== Origins ==

Thr origins are unclear but the name is said to derive from the Gaelic 'Gor Dun' meaning great fort. In the 12th century, [[King David I]] of [[Scotland]] <ref>http://www.scottish-heirloom.com/gordon_clan/scottish_clans_history.html. Gordon Clan </ref> granted the lands to a Norman nobleman by the name of Adam. Adam assumed the name of the land and became known as 'de Gordon'. Adam had two sons, Richard and Adam and, it's thought, the two main branches of the great family are descended from the sons. The father, Adam de Gordon died at the [[Battle of the Standard]] at [[Northallerton]] in [[Yorkshire]] on the 22nd. August, 1138.<ref>http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Gordon Classic Encyclopedia - Gordons.</ref> The de Gordons held the lairdship of Gordon for over two centuries and were thought to have built a castle at the former hamlet of Huntly just to the north; they still held lands up to the 18th century.<ref> Statistical Accounts of Scotland. 1791&ndash;1799. Volume 5 page 88</ref>
The Gordon family are the ancestors of the [[Dukes of Richmond]] and Gordon and of the [[Marquis of Huntly]].<ref>http://www.electricscotland.com/History/gazetteer/index.htm Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland, page 201. Gordon. Edited by Francis Groome</ref>.

== Church ==
[[image:St. Michael's at Gordon.jpg|thumb|right|St. Michael's Parish Church]]
In 1171, the chapel at Gordon, dedicated to [[St. Michael]], was transferred by the monks of [[Coldingham]] to their counterparts at [[Kelso]] in return for the church at Earlston. The present church was built in 1763 and is a part of the [[Church of Scotland]].<ref>http://www.electricscotland.com/History/gazetteer/index.htm Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland, page 201, Gordon. Edited by Francis Groome</ref>.
A [[Free Church of Scotland]] was opened in 1843 <ref>http://genuki.org.uk/big/sct/BEW/Gordon.html Genuki, Gordon. </ref> but that is now used as a private home.

== Greenknowe Tower ==

In 1408, Alexander Seton married Elizabeth Gordon, heiress of the Gordon family,<ref>http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/earldomschapter3s/htm Earls and Earldoms of Scotland</ref> and they were granted lands at Greenknowe, just to the west of the village. A descendent of the family, James Seton of Touch, married Janet Edmonstone and it was they who built the tower in 1581. Their initials IS/IE (the 'I' is Latin for 'J') are carved above the entrance.<ref>http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/earlston/greenknowetower/index.html Undiscovered Scotland, Greenknowe Tower. </ref> Later owners of the tower were Walter Pringle of Stichill, the [[Covenanter]] and the [[Dalrymple]] family. The tower is now in the care of [[Historic Scotland]].<ref>http://www.duns.bordernet.co.uk/tourist/attractions/greenknowe.html.</ref><ref>http://www.discovertheborders.co.uk/places/10.html.</ref>

== Today ==

Modern Gordon  boasts a Church of Scotland kirk, a nursery, a primary school. a lawn bowling club, a community woodland, village hall, two public houses and the village shop/post office. The main street has not changed for many years though there has been much housing development at the north end of the village off Station Road.
