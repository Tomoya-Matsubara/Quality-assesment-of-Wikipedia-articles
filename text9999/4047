The '''St. Johns-Indian River Barge Canal''' was a planned [[canal]] in the state of [[Florida]], {{convert|35.2|mi|km}}<ref name="VolRoute3">[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=N2UpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=f8kEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2209,5779321 "River Canal Project Gets $27.5 Million Tag As Plans Grow"], ''[[Daytona Beach Morning Journal]], 24 June 1968</ref> in length and linking the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] and the [[Indian River (Florida)|Indian River]] {{convert|5|mi|km}} south of [[Oak Hill, Florida|Oak Hill]]<ref name="VolShad">[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lJcpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SckEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2049,3487878 "Propose New Canal Route To Save Shad"], ''Daytona Beach Morning Journal'', 18 June 1966</ref> with the [[St. Johns River]], originally intended to be just south of [[Lake Harney]],<ref name="VolRoute1">[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1870&dat=19640307&id=lPknAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QcoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2502,1190923 "Volusia Route Approved For Barge Canal"], ''[[Daytona Beach News-Journal|Daytona Beach Sunday News-Journal]]'', 7 March 1964</ref> but later shifted to be near [[Lake Monroe]],<ref name="VolRoute2">[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YJseAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kcwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2614,4288948 "Proposed River Barge Canal Route Okayed"] ''[[Daytona Beach Morning Journal]], 23 May 1964</ref> with all but three miles of the route within [[Volusia County]].<ref name="VolShad"/> However, by 1968 the more southerly Lake Harney alignment had returned to favor and the canal was not built.<ref name="VolAlign">[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oU8gAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mckEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1802,1408119 "Joins Three Counties In Canal Dist."], ''Daytona Beach Sunday News-Journal'', 2 December 1968</ref>
