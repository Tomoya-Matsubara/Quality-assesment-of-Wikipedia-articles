In this episode, [[Jack Donaghy]] (played by [[Alec Baldwin]]) stages a televised firework display, in an attempt to show up his rival, [[List of recurring characters on 30 Rock#Devon Banks|Devon Banks]] (Will Arnett). Devon, upon their first meeting, develops a crush on [[Kenneth Parcell]] ([[Jack McBrayer]]). [[Liz Lemon]] ([[Tina Fey]]) follows [[List of recurring characters on 30 Rock#Floyd|Floyd]] (Jason Sudeikis), a colleague whom she is attracted to, into [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (AA) in an attempt to get closer to him. [[Tracy Jordan]] ([[Tracy Morgan]]) discovers that he is related to [[Thomas Jefferson]] and decides to honor his ancestor. [[James "Toofer" Spurlock]] ([[Keith Powell]]) discovers a shocking secret about one of his own ancestors.

==Plot==
When Devon Banks, the Vice President of West Coast News, Web Content, and Theme Park Talent Relations visits from [[Los Angeles]], Jack fears that he is trying to take his job. After having his assistant Jonathan spy on Banks, he learns that Banks is gay and that he is interested in Kenneth. Jack sends Kenneth to try to gather information on what Banks is planning to do, but Kenneth is inept and fails at the task. Jack then enlists Liz to help him come up with some ideas so that he can impress the network and win the power coup over Banks. Jack sends Kenneth to seduce Banks again so that he will be late for the important meeting, but Banks sees through the plan and arrives at the meeting anyway.

Meanwhile, Liz sees Floyd, the corporate employee who she has a crush on, go into a church on a Tuesday afternoon. The next week, she follows him in and finds that he is attending an AA meeting. Liz pretends to be an alcoholic so that she can get closer to Floyd and hear his secrets. After finding out that members of the same AA group are not allowed to date, Liz confesses to Floyd that she was never an alcoholic and that she made it up to get close to him. He gets mad and feels betrayed, so she apologizes and tells him all of her secrets to make it up to him. Floyd forgives her and they begin dating. 

When it comes time for Jack's important meeting with the network and showdown against Devon Banks, Liz is too busy pursuing Floyd to help Jack with his idea. Jack has to attend the meeting alone, but his idea for a fireworks special impresses the network and he successfully defends his job against Devon Banks. When the fireworks special actually airs, however, the fireworks are shot off in midtown New York outside [[Rockefeller Center]] and it ends up looking like a [[terrorism|terrorist]] attack. Panic results and [[Mayor of New York City|the mayor]] calls, causing the event to be unceremoniously ended.

Tracy is served with paternity papers and insists that the child is not his. After the DNA test, Tracy learns that the child is not his but that he is a direct descendant of Thomas Jefferson. The news angers Tracy and he talks to Toofer and Frank about it. Toofer learns that he is a direct descendant of Tobias Spurlock, a black [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldier.  Tracy and Toofer are upset about the news until Tracy has a dream in which Thomas Jefferson (portrayed by Jack Donaghy) appears to him on ''[[The Maury Povich Show]]''.  In the dream, Jefferson takes credit for "inventing" America and tells Tracy to forget his past. Tracy decides that he wants Toofer to write a movie about their experiences and Thomas Jefferson's life. Tracy intends to play all of the parts in the movie, except he intends for the film to be a drama.

This is Jack McBrayer and Will Arnett's third time working together.

''[[Star Wars]]'' is frequently referenced in ''30 Rock'', beginning with the [[Pilot (30 Rock)|pilot episode]] where Tracy Jordan is seen shouting that he is a [[Jedi]].<ref name="plotreference">{{cite episode |title=Pilot |episodelink=Pilot (30 Rock) |series=30 Rock |credits=Writer(s): [[Tina Fey]]; Director: [[Adam Bernstein]] |network=[[NBC Universal]] |station=[[NBC]] |airdate=2006-10-11 |season=1 |number=1}}</ref> Liz Lemon admits to being a huge fan of ''Star Wars'', saying that she had watched it many times with [[Pete Hornberger]] ([[Scott Adsit]]),<ref name="fireworks">{{cite episode |title=Fireworks |episodelink= |series=30 Rock |credits=Writers : Dave Finkel, Brett Baer; Director: Beth McCarthy |network=[[NBC Universal]] |station=[[NBC]] |airdate=2007-04-05 |season=1 |number=18}}</ref> and saying she dressed up as the ''Star Wars'' character [[Princess Leia Organa|Princess Leia]] during four Halloweens.<ref name="souce">{{cite episode |title=The Source Awards |episodelink= |series=30 Rock |credits=Writer(s): Robert Carlock, [[Daisy Gardner]]; Director: Don Scardino |network=[[NBC Universal]] |station=[[NBC]] |airdate=2007-03-01 |season=1 |number=16}}</ref> Fey, a fan of ''Star Wars'' herself, said that the weekly ''Star Wars'' joke or reference "started happening organically" when the crew realized that they had a ''Star Wars'' reference "in almost every show". Fey said that from then on "it became a thing where [they] tried to keep it going", and that even though they could not include one in every episode, they still had a "pretty high batting average". Fey attributed most of the references to [[Robert Carlock]], who she described as "the resident expert".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.craveonline.com/articles/filmtv/04648653/tina_fey_gets_the_gold.html |title=Tina Fey Gets the Gold |accessdate=2008-07-07 |author=Topel, Fred |date=2007-09-16 |publisher=Crave Online}}</ref> In this episode, ''Star Wars'' is referenced twice: once when Liz tells Floyd that she and Pete are watching the movies on the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies]] list, but they only own ''Star Wars'' and ''[[Tootsie]]'' so they keep watching those two films. It is again referenced during Tracy's dream, when Thomas Jefferson holds his hand up to Tracy and says "May [[The Force (Star Wars)|the Force]] be with you always".

Matt Webb Mitovich of ''[[TV Guide]]'' thought that Will Arnett, who appeared as Devon Banks, was "shrewdly cast". Webb Mitovich added that this episode displayed some "good, good stuff".<ref>{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Webb Mitovich |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=April 5, 2007: "Sir, It's the Mayor" |url=http://tvguide.liveworld.com/blog-entry/TV-Show-Blog/30-Rock/April-5-2007/700017587 |work= |publisher=''[[TV Guide]]'' |date=2007-04-05 |accessdate=2008-08-16 }}</ref> Anna Johns of [[AOL]]'s [[TV Squad]] declared "Fireworks" as "one of the best episodes so far this season" citing that "the writers juggled a handful of storylines very, very well". She wrote that the best part of the episodes were "the one-liners. They had [her] laughing so hard that [she] frequently had to pause the [[TiVo]] to recover."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/04/06/30-rock-fireworks/ |title=''30 Rock'': "Fireworks" |accessdate=2008-08-16 |last=Johns |first=Anna |coauthors= |date=2007-04-06 |work= |publisher=[[AOL]]'s [[TV Squad]]}}</ref> Robert Canning of [[IGN]] wrote that this episode "was another prime example of what this show is capable of". He thought that "the choice of Arnett as Jack Donaghy's nemesis was perfect, right down to their shared graveled vocal delivery", and that recurring character Chris Parnell's "short, quick hitting scenes are always nonsensical perfection". <ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/778/778972p1.html |title=''30 Rock'': "Fireworks" Review |accessdate=2008-08-16 |last=Canning |first=Robert |coauthors= |date=2007-04-09 |work= |publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref>
