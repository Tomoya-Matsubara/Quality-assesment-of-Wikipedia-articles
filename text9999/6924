'''''Endangered Species''''' is a [[2007]] story set in the [[X-Men]] franchise that continues to build on the events presented in the [[House of M]] storyline.  Essentially the mutant race has been reduced to approximately [[X-Men: The 198|198]] individuals in total, setting them quite literally on the brink of extinction.  As the X-Men begin to realize that no new mutants have either developed new powers or even been born, it is Hank Mccoy, a.k.a. The [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], who takes it upon himself to investigate both the long term effects of the predicament as well as any possible solutions before his race fades away forever.  Meanwhile, another party is bent on sealing their fate.

The story takes place in 18 separate issues counting the initial one-shot, and crosses over four of the major X-Men titles of the time: [[Uncanny X-Men]], [[X-Men (vol. 2)|X-Men]], [[New X-Men]], and [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].  It has also been revealed that the book Cable & Deadpool will have a major event take place although it is as yet unclear whether or not this will impact Endangered Species.  [[Astonishing X-Men]], [[Excalibur (comics)|New Excalibur]], and [[Wolverine (comics)| Wolverine]] books are not involved in the crossover. Each of the issues involved will feature an 8-page backup story in addition to the regular issue, which will serve as the setting for the events of Endangered Species.  Marvel has already announced that these 40 page issues will be delievered at the regular newstand price.
 
As of March it has been announced that Endangered Species will in fact be a lead in to a second major story arc involving the X-men beginning in the very late months of 2007.  No details as to the subject matter, format, or books involved have been released as of yet, however several characters from the X-men's past, such as [[Mr. Sinister]], [[Gambit (comics)| Gambit]], and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] have been rumored to have upcoming roles.  Further speculation on this story involves the possible large scale resurection of mutant powers, perhaps at some moral cost.
