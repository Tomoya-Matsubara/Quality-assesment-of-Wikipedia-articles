[[Image:Houston_Texas_CBD.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Skyline District of Downtown]]
'''Downtown Houston''' is [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]'s largest [[business district]].  In terms of office square footage, it is the seventh largest in the [[United States]].

Downtown Houston contains the headquarters of many prominent companies. There is an extensive network of pedestrian [[Houston Downtown Tunnel System|tunnels]] and skywalks connecting the buildings of the district. The tunnel system is home to many fast food restaurants, shops and services. 

Most of the residential units in downtown are conversions of older buildings into modern loft spaces. The lofts are located around the performance halls of the theatre district and near Main Street in the Historic District. Downtown will be adding another 346 apartment units in the next couple of years with the development of Marvey Finger's One Park Place.<ref>http://www.oneparkplacehouston.com/docs/02_ProjectStatisticsSummary.pdf</ref> 

Developers have invested than $4 billion in the last decade to transform downtown into an active city
center with residential housing, a nightlife scene and new transportation.<ref>http://www.houstondowntown.com/Home/GeneralInfo/About/PressRoom/GeneralRelease/General%20Release.PDF</ref> The Cotswold Project, a $62 million project started in 1998, has helped to rebuild the streets and transform 90 downtown blocks into a pedestrian-friendly environment by adding greenery, trees and public art.<ref>http://www.downtownstreets.com/cotswold.htm </ref> The resurgence of downtown is the result of careful urban planning and local foresight. The baseball, basketball, and hockey teams have moved into downtown facilities. January 1, [[2004]] marked the opening of the "new" Main Street, a plaza with many eateries, bars and nightclubs, which brings many visitors to a newly renovated locale.<ref>http://www.houston.org/pdfs/DowntownHoustonProject.pdf</ref> To complete the scene, Main Street Square offers dancing fountains throughout the day. Along the Main Street corridor is the original [[Foley's]] department store which was transformed into [[Macy's]] on September 9.

==History==
Downtown Houston was the original founding point of the city of Houston.  After the Texas Revolution, two New York real estate promoters, John Kirby Allen and Augustus Chapman Allen purchased 6,642 acres (27 km<U+00B2>) of land T. F. L. Parrot ([[John Austin]]'s widow) for $9,428. The Allen brothers first landed in the area where the White Oak Bayou and Buffalo Bayou meet, a spot now known as Allen's Landing. [[Gail Borden, Jr.]], a city planner, laid out wide streets for the town &mdash; an excellent foresight that has prevented gridlock that plague many other urban downtown areas.

The city was granted incorporation by the state legislature on June 5, 1837. Houston was made as the temporary capital of Texas.  In 1840, the town was divided into four wards, each with different functions in the community. The wards are no longer political divisions, but their names are still used. Downtown was originally designated the first ward of Houston

Downtown's growth can be attributed to two major factors.  The first arose after the [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900]], when investors began seeking a location close to the ports of Southwest Texas, but apparently free of the dangerous hurricanes that frequently struck Galveston and other port cities.  Houston became a wise choice, as only the most powerful storms were able to reach the city.  The second came a year later with the 1901 discovery of oil at spindletop, just south of Beaumont.  Shipping and oil industries began flocking to east Texas, many settling in Houston.

The arrival of major industry also saw the advent of skyscrapers in Houston. The building boom of the '70s and '80s saw the erection of major buildings, many of them ranking as the tallest in the state and the nation.

==Architecture==
[[Image:OneShellPlaza.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[One Shell Plaza]]]]
[[Image:Wells Fargo Bank Plaza, Houston, from base.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Wells Fargo Bank Plaza]]]]
In the 1960s, downtown comprised of a modest collection of mid-rise office structures, but has since grown into one of the largest [[skyline]]s in the United States. In 1960, the [[central business district]] had 10 million [[square foot|square feet]] (930,000&nbsp;[[square metre|m<U+00B2>]]) of office space, increasing to about 16 million square feet (1,500,000&nbsp;m<U+00B2>) in 1970. Downtown Houston was on the threshold of a boom in 1970 with 8.7 million square feet (800,000&nbsp;m<U+00B2>) of office space planned or under construction and huge projects being launched by [[real estate developer]]s. The largest proposed development was the 32-block Houston Center. Only a small part of the original proposal was ultimately constructed. Other large projects included the Cullen Center, Allen Center, and towers for [[Shell Oil Company]]. The surge of skyscrapers mirrored the skyscraper booms in other cities, such as [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]. Houston experienced another downtown construction spurt in the 1970s with the energy industry boom.

[[Image:Chase_Tower,_a_block_away.jpg|150px|thumb|[[JPMorgan Chase Tower (Houston)|JPMorgan Chase Tower]]]]
The first major [[skyscraper]] to be constructed in Houston was the 50-floor, 218&nbsp;m (714 ft) [[One Shell Plaza]] in 1971. A succession of skyscrapers were built throughout the 1970s, culminating with Houston's tallest skyscraper, the 75-floor, 305&nbsp;m (1,002 ft) [[JPMorgan Chase Tower (Houston)|JPMorgan Chase Tower]] (formerly the Texas Commerce Tower), which was completed in 1982. In 2002, it was the tallest structure in Texas, ninth-tallest building in the United States and the 23rd tallest skyscraper in the [[world]]. In 1983, the 71-floor, 296&nbsp;m (970 ft) [[Wells Fargo Bank Plaza]] was completed, which became the second-tallest building in Houston and Texas, and 11th-tallest in the country. Skyscraper construction in downtown Houston came to an end in the mid-1980s with the collapse of Houston's energy industry and the resulting economic recession. When the 53-floor, 232&nbsp;m [[Texaco]] [[Heritage Plaza (building)|Heritage Plaza]] was completed in 1987, it appeared that no more skyscrapers would be constructed for a while. 

Twelve years later, the Houston-based [[Enron Corporation]] began construction of a 40-floor skyscraper in 1999 (which was completed in 2002)<ref>http://www.glasssteelandstone.com/US/TX/HoustonEnronSouth.html</ref> with the company collapsing in one of the most dramatic corporate failures in the history of the United States only two years later.  Chevron bought this building to set up a regional upstream energy headquarters and in late 2006 announced further  consolidation of employees downtown from satellite suburban buildings and even Ca. and La. offices by leasing the original Enron  building across the street.  Both buildings are connected by a second-floor unique walk-across, air-conditioned circular skybridge with 3 points of connection to both office buildings and a large parking deck.  Other smaller office structures were built in the 2000&ndash;2003 period. As of September 2007, downtown Houston had over 40 million square feet (3,787,147&nbsp;m<U+00B2>) of office space, including over 29 million square feet (1,861,704&nbsp;m<U+00B2>) of class A office space.<ref>http://www.houstondowntown.com/Home/Business/DoingBusiness/DowntownFacts1/Downtown%20Facts.PDF</ref>

Some people believe this building wasn't entirely built by George Dickey.  They believe parts of the W.A.
