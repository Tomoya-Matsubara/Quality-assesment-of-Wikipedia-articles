The '''Scottish Football Association Challenge Cup'''<ref>[http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/res/documents/SFAPublication/SFAHandbook/06-11CupCompRules.pdf SFA Handbook 2006-07 ''Cup Competition Rules'']</ref>, commonly known as the '''Scottish Cup'''<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_cups/8266911.stm Scottish Cup given new branding]</ref> is the main national cup competition in [[Football in Scotland|Scottish football]]. It is a [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout]] cup competition run by and named after the [[Scottish Football Association]].

The Scottish Cup trophy is the oldest original national trophy in the world. It was first held in [[Scottish Cup 1873<U+2013>74|1873-74]], with the first winners being [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]].

The current holders of the Scottish Cup are [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]], who beat [[Ross County F.C.|Ross County]] 3-0 in the [[2010 Scottish Cup Final|2010 final]] on 15 May 2010.

== Format ==
{{Main|Scottish Cup Format}}

The competition is a [[single elimination|knockout]] one. Teams are drawn against each other randomly. The team who is drawn first from each tie is the home team. If the first match finishes in a [[Tie (draw)|draw]], a [[replay]] is played at the stadium of the second team drawn. In the replay, if the scores are still level at full time, [[extra time]] is played and (if necessary) [[Penalty shootout (football)|penalties]] are used to decide the winner of the tie.

The semi-final matches are played at neutral stadiums, usually the national stadium (smaller stadiums if the teams do not bring a large support) [[Hampden Park]] and the final itself is traditionally played at Hampden. [[Celtic Park]] staged the finals in [[Scottish Cup 1992-93|1993]] and [[Scottish Cup 1997-98|1998]] and [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] staged the final in [[Scottish Cup 1996-97|1997]] while Hampden was being redeveloped. The final and semi-final do not have replays and are played to a finish. Extra time is played and penalties are used if necessary. Two finals ([[Scottish Cup 1989-90|1990]] and [[Scottish Cup 2005-06|2006]]) have been decided by penalties.

=== Entry criteria ===
Previously clubs in the [[Scottish League Third Division|Third]] and [[Scottish League Second Division|Second Division]]s qualified automatically for the first round, along with four [[non-league]] teams each from the [[Scottish Qualifying Cup]] (North) and (South) competitions. Clubs in the [[Scottish League First Division|First Division]] and the [[Scottish Premier League]] had automatic byes to the third round. However, from the [[2007<U+2013>08 in Scottish football|2007<U+2013>08 season]] new criteria were introduced for entry into the Scottish Cup.<ref>[http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football.cfm?curpageid=1428 Scottish Football Association ''The Scottish Cup 2007/08'']</ref> The [[Scottish Qualifying Cup]] competitions were scrapped and the 36 [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] member clubs outwith the [[Scottish Premier League|SPL]] and [[Scottish Football League|SFL]] were given direct entry to the 1st Round of the cup. Additionally, the league winners of the East of Scotland and South of Scotland Leagues, both of which contain some clubs that are not full members of the SFA and hence could not previously enter the Scottish Cup, were given a place in the draw.

Clubs from Scottish Junior football (all but one of whom are not members of the SFA as they belong to the [[Scottish Junior Football Association|Scottish Junior FA]]) were admitted for the first time in the 2007<U+2013>08 competition. Up to four Junior clubs are allowed to enter, these being the champions of the previous season's [[Scottish Junior Football North Premier League]], the [[Scottish Junior Football West Premier League]], the [[Scottish Junior Football East Region Super League]], and the winner of the [[Scottish Junior Cup]] if they have not also won one of the three top regional league titles.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_cups/6711023.stm Junior clubs enter Scottish Cup]</ref> The first three Junior clubs to qualify for the tournament were [[Culter F.C.|Culter]], [[Pollok F.C.|Pollok]] and [[Linlithgow Rose F.C.|Linlithgow Rose]].  During Season 2008<U+2013>09, Junior sides [[Bathgate Thistle F.C.|Bathgate Thistle]], [[Pollok F.C.|Pollok]], [[Banks O' Dee F.C.|Banks O' Dee]] and [[Lochee United F.C.|Lochee United]] will compete in the tournament.

== European qualification ==
As with all domestic cup competitions in [[UEFA]] countries, the winners of the Scottish Cup qualify for the following season's [[UEFA Europa League]] (previously the [[UEFA Cup]]). If the winners have already qualified for a higher-ranked tournament, either by winning the league (or in modern times, finishing second), the cup runners-up are awarded a place in Europe. This has been quite a regular occurrence in Scotland, with either [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] or [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] often winning '[[The Double]]', while [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] also achieved that feat in 1984. In 2006, [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] had already qualified for the Champions League by finishing second in the [[Scottish Premier League|SPL]], and then won the [[2006 Scottish Cup Final]]. Therefore, the Scottish Cup place in Europe passed to [[Gretna F.C.|Gretna]], the beaten finalists.

In 2008, the [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] announced that in such a situation the place would in future be awarded to the highest-placed club in the SPL who had not otherwise qualified for Europe. This followed some disappointing performances by middle-ranking Scottish teams including [[Gretna F.C.|Gretna]], [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] and [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]]. All those clubs were knocked out at the first hurdle of the [[UEFA Cup]] which reduced the nation's [[UEFA coefficient|coefficient]], the calculation used to determine the number of places allocated in UEFA tournaments. [[UEFA]] blocked the proposed change, however, insisting that a club from the cup competition should represent Scotland. Therefore [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League 2009-10]], despite losing the [[2009 Scottish Cup Final]] to league champions Rangers. Falkirk then lost in their opening European tie to [[FC Vaduz]] of Liechtenstein.

== "Giant killers" ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}

Because it involves clubs of all standards playing against each other, there is the possibility for "[[underdog (competition)|minnow]]s" from the lower or [[Scottish Junior Football Association|junior]] divisions to become "giant-killers" by eliminating top clubs from the tournament. Some famous cup shocks include 1938, when [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]] [[East Fife F.C.|East Fife]] were the victors in the final against [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] and thus won the cup.

On 31 January 1959, Highland League outfit Fraserburgh's won 1-0 against a Dundee side which had seven Scottish internationals in their side. In 1967, [[Berwick Rangers F.C.|Berwick Rangers]] defeated [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] 1<U+2013>0, Sammy Reid scoring the only goal of the match.

In 2000, [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle]] travelled to [[Celtic Park]] in Glasgow to face [[Celtic F.C|Celtic]], then managed by former England and Liverpool player [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]]. The then First Division side pulled off the most famous of cup-upsets, defeating the home side by a score of 3-1 and giving rise to the immortal newspaper headline the following day, "Super Caley Go Ballistic, Celtic Are Atrocious". The result proved to be the catalyst for the departure of John Barnes as Celtic boss. Caley would also record another victory at home to [[Martin O'Neill]]'s Celtic side in 2003.

Celtic, with a debutante [[Roy Keane]] in tow, also fell victim to [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]], a side whose average age was 21, when they were beaten 2<U+2013>1 at [[Broadwood Stadium]] in January 2006. On 10 April 2010, First Division club [[Ross County F.C.|Ross County]] beat [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] 2-0 to reach the final for the first time in their history.
