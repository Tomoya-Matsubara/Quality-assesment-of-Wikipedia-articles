'''Thanjavur''', formerly '''Tanjore''',<ref name="britannicap195">[[#Pletcher|Pletcher]] 2010, p. 195</ref> is a city which is the headquarters of the [[Thanjavur District]] in the [[south India]]n state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. Scholars believe the name ''Thanjavur'' is derived from Tanjan, a legendary demon in [[Hindu mythology]]. While the early history of Thanjavur remains unclear, the city first rose to prominence during the reign of [[Medieval Cholas]] when it served as the capital of the empire. After the fall of Cholas, the city was ruled by various dynasties like [[Pandyas]], [[Vijayanagar Empire]], [[Madurai Nayaks]], [[Thanjavur Nayaks]], [[Thanjavur Marathas]] and the [[British Empire]]. It has been a part of independent India since 1947.

Thanjavur is an important centre of South Indian religion, art, and architecture. Most of the [[Great Living Chola Temples]], which are [[World Heritage Sites|UNESCO World Heritage Monuments]], are located in and around Thanjavur. The foremost among these, the [[Brihadeeswara Temple]], is located in the centre of the city. Thanjavur is also home to [[Tanjore painting]], a painting style unique to the region. The city is an important agricultural centre located in the [[Cauvery Delta]] and is known as the "Rice bowl of Tamil Nadu". Thanjavur is administered by a [[Thanjavur Municipal Corporation|municipal corporation]] covering an area of {{convert|36.33|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} and had a population of 222,619 in 2011.

Roadways are the major means of transportation, while the city also has rail connectivity. The nearest airport is [[Tiruchirapalli International Airport]], located {{convert|56| km|mi|abbr=on}} away from the city. The nearest seaport is [[Karaikal|Karaikal Port]], which is {{Convert|94|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from Thanjavur.

[[File:Thanjavurtown1955.png|200px|left|thumb|Map of Thanjavur city in 1955|alt=image of the old city map]]
As per local legend, the word ''Thanjavur'' is believed to be derived from "Tanjan", an ''[[asura]]'' (giant) in [[Hindu mythology]]. He was killed at this place by the Hindu god Neelamegha Perumal, a form of [[Vishnu]].<ref name="Ayyar">{{Cite book |last=Ayyar |first=P. V.

There are no references to Thanjavur in any of the [[Sangam period]] (third century BC to fourth century AD) [[Tamil language|Tamil]] records, though some scholars believe the existence of the city since then. Kovil Venni, situated at a distance of {{convert|15|mi|km}} to the east of the city, was the site of the Battle of Venni between the Chola king [[Karikala]] and a confederacy of the [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]] and the [[Pandyas]].<ref name="sastrip32">[[#Sastri|Sastri]] 1935, p. 32</ref> The Cholas seemed to have faced an invasion of the [[Kalabhras]] in the third century AD after which the kingdom faded into obscurity. The region around the present day Thanjavur was conquered by the [[Mutharayar]]s during sixth century, who ruled it up to 849.

The Cholas came to prominence once more through the rise of the [[Medieval Chola]] monarch [[Vijayalaya]] (841<U+2013>878) in about 850.<ref name="sastrip110">[[#Sastri|Sastri]] 1935, p. 110</ref> Vijayalaya conquered Thanjavur from the Mutharayar king Elango Mutharayar and built a temple dedicated to Hindu goddess Nisumbhasudani.<ref name="sastrip448">[[#Sastri|Sastri]] 1935, p. 448</ref> His son [[Aditya I]] (871<U+2013>901) consolidated the hold over the city.<ref name="sastrip110" /> The [[Rashtrakuta]] king [[Krishna II]] (878<U+2013>914), a contemporary of the Chola king [[Parantaka I]] (907<U+2013>950), claims to have conquered Thanjavur, but there are no records to support the claim.<ref name="sastrip132">[[#Sastri|Sastri]] 1935, p. 132</ref> Gradually, Thanjavur became the most important city in the Chola Empire and remained its capital till the emergence of [[Gangaikonda Cholapuram]] in about 1025.<ref name="history"/> During the first decade of the eleventh century, the Chola king [[Raja Raja Chola I]] (985<U+2013>1014) constructed the [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]] at Thanjavur. The temple is considered to be one of the best specimens of South Indian temple architecture.<ref>{{cite book| first=Francis D.K.| last= Ching| year= 2007| title= A Global History of Architecture

When the Chola Empire began to decline in the 13th century, the Pandyas from the south invaded and captured Thanjavur twice, first during 1218<U+2013>19 and then during 1230. During the second invasion, the Chola king [[Rajaraja Chola III|Rajaraja III]] (1216<U+2013>56) was set in exile and he sought the help of the [[Hoysala]] king [[Vira Narasimha II]] (1220<U+2013>35) to regain Thanjavur.<ref name="sastrip4222">[[#Sastri|Sastri]] 1935, p. 422</ref> Thanjavur was eventually annexed along with the rest of the Chola kingdom by the Pandya king [[Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I]] (1268<U+2013>1308) in 1279 and the Chola kings were forced to accept the suzerainty of the Pandyas.<ref name="sastrip429">[[#Sastri|Sastri]] 1935, p. 429</ref> The Pandyas ruled Thanjavur from 1279 to 1311 when their kingdom was raided and annexed by the forces of [[Malik Kafur]] (1296<U+2013>1306) and  [[Delhi Sultanate]].<ref name="Aiyangar">{{cite book|title=South India and her Muhammadan invaders|year=1921|first=S.

Thanjavur was successfully conquered in 1674 by [[Ekoji I]] (1675<U+2013>84), the [[Maratha]] feudatory of the Nawab of Bijapur and half-brother of [[Shivaji]] (1627/30-80). Ekoji founded the [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom]] which ruled Thanjavur till 1855.<ref name="history"/><ref name="mitchellp91" /> The Marathas exercised their sovereignty over Thanjavur throughout the last quarter of the 17th and the whole of the 18th century. The Maratha rulers patronized [[Carnatic music]]. In 1787, Amar Singh, the regent of Thanjavur, deposed the minor Raja, his nephew [[Serfoji II]] (1787<U+2013>93) and captured the throne. Serfoji II was restored in 1799 with the assistance of the [[British Raj|British]], who induced him to relinquish the administration of the kingdom and left him in charge of Thanjavur fort and surrounding areas. The kingdom was eventually absorbed into British India in 1855 by the [[Doctrine of Lapse]] when [[Shivaji II]] (1832<U+2013>55), the last Thanjavur Maratha ruler, died without a legitimate male heir. The British referred to the city as Tanjore in their records.<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.municipality.tn.gov.in/thanjavur/about-history.htm|title=History of Thanjavur|publisher=Thanjavur Municipality |accessdate=2012-07-02 }}</ref> Five years after its annexation, the British replaced Negapatam (modern-day [[Nagapattinam]]) with Thanjavur as the seat of the district administration.
