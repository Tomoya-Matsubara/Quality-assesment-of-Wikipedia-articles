A '''hypercycle''' is a new level of organization whereby [[self-replication|self-replicative]] units are connected in a cyclic, [[autocatalytic]] manner. The self-replicative units are themselves (auto)catalytic cycles.<ref>Eigen, M., and P. Schuster. 1978. <U+201C>Part A: Emergence of the Hypercycle.<U+201D> Naturwissenschaften 65:7<U+2013>41. http://www.springerlink.com/index/N1431278021QVP77.pdf.</ref> The hypercycle is a specific model of the [[abiogenesis|chemical origin of life]], pioneered by [[Manfred Eigen|Eigen]] and [[Peter Schuster|Schuster]]. From random distributions of chemicals, the hypercycle model seeks to find and grow sets of chemical transformations that include self-reinforcing loops.<ref>Padgett, J.F., D. Lee, and N. Collier. 2003. <U+201C>Economic production as chemistry.<U+201D> Industrial and Corporate Change 12:843. http://icc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/843.</ref> Hypercycles are very similar with autocatalytic systems in that both represent a cyclic arrangement of catalysts which themselves are cycles of reactions. The difference of hypercycles is that the catalysts that constitute them are themselves self-replicative.
