The '''Daleks''' (pronounced "DAH-lecks"; [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/'d<U+0251><U+02D0>l<U+025B>ks/}}) are a [[fiction]]al [[extraterrestrial life in culture|extraterrestrial]] race of [[mutant]]s from the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. A Dalek is a grotesque mutated organism integrated with a [[tank]]-like mechanical casing made of "[[Fictional element|dalekanium]]".<ref name="Manhattan" /><ref name="Invasion3" />  The resulting creatures are a powerful race bent on universal conquest and domination, utterly without pity, compassion or remorse (as all of their emotions were removed except hate).<ref name=Dalek (episode) /> They are also, collectively, the greatest alien adversaries of the [[Time Lord]] known as the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]]. Their most famous [[catchphrase]] is "EX-TER-MI-NATE!", with each syllable individually screeched in a frantic electronic voice ({{Audio|Dalek Exterminate all humans.ogg|play sample}}).

The Daleks were created by writer [[Terry Nation]] and [[BBC]] designer [[Raymond Cusick]] and were introduced in December 1963 in the [[The Daleks|second ''Doctor Who'' serial]].<ref name=B2>{{cite episode

They have become synonymous with ''Doctor Who'', and their behaviour and catchphrases are part of British [[popular culture]]. "Hiding [[behind the sofa]] whenever the Daleks appear" has even been cited as an essential element of British cultural identity, along with [[Bovril]] and [[tea (meal)|afternoon tea]].<ref>{{cite news

===Costume details===
The non-humanoid shape of the Dalek did much to enhance the creatures' sense of menace. A lack of familiar reference points differentiated them from the traditional "bug-eyed monster" of science fiction, which ''Doctor Who'' creator [[Sydney Newman]] had wanted the show to avoid.<ref> Howe (1992), pp. 3, 26<U+2013>27</ref> The unsettling form of the Daleks, coupled with their alien voices, made many believe that the props were wholly mechanical and operated by remote control.<ref name="dalek companion">Howe (2004), p. 31</ref> 

The Daleks were actually controlled from inside by short operators<ref name="Monsters-82">Howe (1997), p. 82</ref> who had to manipulate their eyestalks, domes and arms, as well as flashing the lights on their heads in sync with the actors supplying their voices. The Dalek cases were built in two pieces; an operator would step into the lower section, and then the top would be secured.  The operators looked out between the circular louvres just beneath the dome that were lined with mesh to conceal their faces.<ref name="Monsters-82" />

In addition to being hot and cramped, the Dalek casings also muffled external sounds, making it difficult for the operators to hear the director's commands or studio dialogue. The top sections were also too heavy to lift from the inside, which meant that the operators could be trapped inside if the stagehands forgot to release them. [[John Scott Martin]], a Dalek operator from the original series, said that Dalek operation was a challenge: "You had to have about six hands: one to do the eyestalk, one to do the lights, one for the gun, another for the smoke canister underneath, yet another for the sink plunger.  If you were related to an octopus then it helped."<ref name="Monsters_85"> Howe (1997), p. 85</ref>

The Dalek cases created for ''Doctor Who'''s 21st-century revival do not differ significantly from the original series' Daleks, except for an expanded base, a glowing eyepiece (though in early serials including ''The Daleks'' and ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'', the Daleks were shown with the black and white television equivalent), an all-over metallic brass finish, a housing for the eyestalk gear, and significantly larger ear-bulbs (that resemble the movie versions). The new prop made its on-screen debut in the 2005 episode "Dalek". 

====Movement====
Early versions of the Daleks were rolled around on nylon castors or propelled by wheels connected to hand cranks by [[bicycle]] chains. Although castors were adequate for the Daleks' debut serial, which was shot entirely at the BBC's [[Lime Grove Studios]], for ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'', Terry Nation wanted the Daleks to take to the streets of [[London]] for location filming. To enable the Daleks to travel smoothly on location, designer Spencer Chapman built the new Dalek shells around miniature [[tricycle]]s with sturdier wheels; to hide the wheels, the base of the costume was deepened with enlarged fenders.<ref> Howe (1997), pp. 84<U+2013>85</ref>  The bumpy flagstones of Central London caused the Daleks to rattle as they moved and it was not possible to remove this noise from the final soundtrack. A small radar dish was added to the rear of the prop's casing to explain why these Daleks, unlike the ones in their first serial, were not dependent on [[static electricity]] drawn from the floors of the Dalek city for their motive power.<ref name="Monsters_85" />

Later versions of the prop had more efficient wheels and were simply propelled by the operators' feet, but they remained so heavy that when going up ramps they often had to be pushed by stagehands out of camera shot.  The difficulty of operating all the prop's parts at once contributed to the occasionally jerky movements of the Dalek.<ref name="Monsters_85" /> The latest model of the costume still has a human operator within, but the movement of the dome and eyestalk is now remotely controlled so that the operator can concentrate on the smooth movement of the Dalek and its arms.<ref>Russell (2006), p. 163</ref>

====Voices====
The [[staccato]] delivery and harsh tone of the Dalek voice were initially developed by voice actors [[Peter Hawkins]] and David Graham, who would vary the pitch and speed of the lines according to the emotion needed. Their voices were further processed electronically by Brian Hodgson at the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]]. Although the exact sound-processing devices used have varied, the original 1963 effect used [[equalization|EQ]] to boost the mid-range of the actor's voice, then subjected it to [[ring modulation]] with a 30 Hz [[sine wave]]. The distinctive harsh grating vocal timbre this produced has remained the pattern for all Dalek voices since. Another notable voice actor for the Daleks was [[Roy Skelton]] who first voiced the Daleks in the 1967 story ''[[Evil of the Daleks]]''. Also voicing the Daleks in small parts were Michael Wisher, who performed in ''[[Planet of the Daleks]]'' and ''[[Death to the Daleks]]'', and Royce Mills, who is mainly remembered for his Dalek voice in ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]''. Also, in a one off episode, Oliver Glibert and Peter Messalaine played the Dalek voices in ''Day of the Daleks''.<ref name="talking daleks">Finklestone, Peter (producer) (2003). "Talking Daleks" featurette, ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' DVD. London, UK: BBC Video.</ref>

Since 2005, the Dalek voice in the television series has been provided by [[Nicholas Briggs]], speaking into a microphone connected to a voice modulator.<ref name="dalek confidential">{{cite episode

====Construction====
Manufacturing the props was expensive. In scenes where many Daleks had to appear, some of them would be represented by wooden replicas (''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]''<ref name=Destiny>''[[Destiny of the Daleks]].''

In stories involving armies of Daleks, the BBC effects team even turned to using commercially-available toy Daleks, manufactured by [[Louis Marx and Company|Louis Marx & Co]]. A typical example of such use can be observed in ''Planet of the Daleks''.<ref name=Planet6 /> Judicious editing techniques also made it look like there were more Dalek props than were actually available, and continue to be used to the present day, such as using [[split screen (film)|split screen]] in "The Parting of the Ways".<ref name=Parting />

Four fully functioning props were commissioned for the first serial, constructed from BBC plans by Shawcraft Models;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/b.html |title=The Daleks |accessdate=2006-12-23 |last=Sullivan |first=Shannon Patrick |date=2006-07-24 |work=A Brief History of Time (Travel)}}</ref> these became known in fan circles as "Mk I Daleks". Shawcraft were also commissioned to construct approximately twenty Daleks for the two Dalek movies in 1965 and 1966 (see [[#Other appearances|below]]). Some of these props from the movies filtered back to the BBC and were seen in the televised serials, notably in ''The Chase'', which was aired before the first movie's debut.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/r.html |title=The Chase |accessdate=2006-12-23 |last=Sullivan |first=Shannon Patrick |date=2006-04-18 |work=A Brief History of Time (Travel)}}</ref> The remaining props not bought by the BBC were either donated to charity or given away as prizes in competitions.<ref>Howe (1992), pp. 132, 137</ref>

The BBC's own Dalek props were reused several times, but eventually years of storage and repainting took their toll. By the time of the [[Sixth Doctor]]'s ''Revelation of the Daleks'', the props were manufactured out of [[fibreglass]], and were lighter and more affordable to construct than their predecessors.<ref name="Monsters_92">Howe (1997), p. 92</ref> These Daleks were slightly bulkier in appearance around the mid-shoulder section, and also had a slightly redesigned base which was more vertical at the back. Minor changes were made to the design thanks to these new methods of construction, including alterations to the lower skirting as well as the mid-shoulder section incorporating the arm boxes, which were now one single unit, with the vertical bands encircling the casing also included in the fibreglass mould.<ref name="Monsters_92" /> These were repainted in grey for the [[Seventh Doctor]] serial ''Remembrance of the Daleks'' and designated as "[[Dalek variants#Standard Dalek|Renegade Daleks]]"; another redesign, painted in white and gold, became the "[[Dalek variants#Imperial Dalek|Imperial Dalek]]" faction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/7h.html |title=Remembrance of the Daleks |accessdate=2006-12-23 |last=Sullivan |first=Shannon Patrick |work=A Brief History of Time (Travel)}}</ref><!--The new methods of construction also allowed the BBC Effects Department to build non-working "dummy" Daleks meant for use in scenes involving pyrotechnics. Several of these props were blown up in controlled explosions during the filming of ''Remembrance of the Daleks'', which would not have been cost-efficient with working props.{{cn}}-->

===Conceptual history===
[[Image:TheDalekChronicles-004.jpg|thumb|200px|A page from the TV 21 comic strip, featuring the creation of the Emperor Dalek]]
Wishing to create an alien creature that did not look like a "man in a suit", Terry Nation stated in his script for the first Dalek serial that the Dalek should have no legs.<ref name="Monsters-80">Howe (1997), p. 80</ref>  He was also inspired by a performance by the [[Georgian State Ballet]], in which dancers in long skirts appeared to glide across the stage.<ref name="Monsters-80" /> For many of the shows, the Daleks were "played" by retired ballet dancers wearing black socks while sitting inside the Dalek.<ref name="dalek companion"/> Raymond Cusick became designer of the Daleks when [[Ridley Scott]], then a designer for the BBC, proved unavailable after having been assigned to their debut serial.<ref name="scott">Howe (1994), p. 61</ref> An account in Jeremy Bentham's ''Doctor Who <U+2014> The Early Years'' (1986) says that after Nation wrote the script, Cusick was given only an hour to come up with the design for the Daleks, and was inspired in his initial sketches by a pepper shaker on a table.<ref name="bentham">{{cite book |last=Bentham |first=Jeremy |authorlink=Jeremy Bentham (historian) |title=Doctor Who <U+2014> The Early Years |year=1986 |month=May |publisher=W.H. Allen |location=England |id=ISBN 0-491-03612-4}}</ref> However, Cusick himself states that he based it on a man seated in a chair, and only used the pepper shaker to demonstrate how it might move.<ref>Walker (2006), p. 61</ref> 

In 1964, Nation told a ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reporter that the name came from a volume of a dictionary or encyclopedia, the spine of which read "Dal - Lek".<ref name="Peel2122">Peel (1988), pp. 21<U+2013>22 </ref> He later admitted that he had made this up as a reply to a question by a journalist and that anyone who checked out his story would have found him out.<ref name="Peel2122" /> The name had in reality simply rolled off his typewriter.<ref name="companion 13">Howe (1998), p. 13</ref>  Later, Nation was pleasantly surprised to discover that in [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] the word "dalek" means "far", or "distant".<ref name="30 years">Davies, Kevin (director) (1993). ''More than 30 Years in the TARDIS'' London, UK: BBC Video.</ref> Other [[Slavonic languages]] have similar words for "far", such as the Russian <U+0434><U+0430><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+043E> (''daleko''), or the Czech "Dalekohledy" which means "distant viewing" (i.e. telescopes and binoculars). The [[Cyrillic]] letter '''[[De (Cyrillic)|<U+0414>]]''', or "D", coincidentally also resembles a Dalek.  

Nation grew up during [[World War II]], and remembered the fear caused by German bombings. He consciously based the Daleks on the [[Nazism|Nazis]], conceiving the species as faceless, authoritarian figures dedicated to conquest and complete conformity.<ref>Howe (1992), p. 31</ref> The allusion is most obvious in the Dalek stories penned by Nation, in particular ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' (1964) and ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'' (1975).<ref>Miles (2006), pp. 105<U+2013>109</ref><ref>Howe (1998), p. 280</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/genesisofdaleks/detail.shtml |title=Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide - Genesis of the Daleks - Details |accessdate=2007-01-24 |last=Howe |first=David J. |authorlink=David J.

Prior to writing the first Dalek serial, Nation was chief scriptwriter for comedian [[Tony Hancock]]. The two fell out and Nation either resigned or was fired.<ref name="Monsters-80" /><ref name="Peel2122" /><ref>Miles (2006), p. 40</ref> When Hancock left the BBC, he worked on several series proposals, one of which was called ''From Plip to Plop'', a comedic history of the world which would have ended with a nuclear apocalypse, the survivors being reduced to living in dustbin-like robot casings and eating radiation to stay alive. According to biographer Cliff Goodwin, when Hancock saw the Daleks he allegedly shouted at the screen, "That bloody Nation <U+2014> he's stolen my robots!"<ref name="hancock">{{cite book |last=Goodwin |first=Cliff |authorlink=Cliff Goodwin |title=When the Wind Changed: The Life and Death of Tony Hancock |year=2000 |month=Nov |publisher=Arrow |location=England |id=ISBN 0-09-960941-X}}</ref>

The first Dalek serial is called, variously, ''The Survivors'' (the pre-production title), ''The Mutants'' (its official title at the time of production and broadcast, later taken by a [[The Mutants|second, unrelated ''Doctor Who'' story]]), ''Beyond the Sun'', ''The Dead Planet'', or simply ''The Daleks''.  (The [[Doctor Who story title debate|naming of early ''Doctor Who'' stories]] is complex and sometimes controversial.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://homepages.bw.edu/~jcurtis/Pixley_3.htm |title=By Any Other Name |accessdate=2006-12-18 |last=Pixley |first=Andrew |date=[[2001-01-15]] |work=Earthbound Timelords}}</ref> 

The instant appeal of the Daleks caught the BBC off guard,<ref name="Peel2122"/> and transformed ''Doctor Who'' from a Saturday tea-time children's educational programme to a must-watch national phenomenon. Children were alternately frightened and fascinated by the alien look of the monsters, and the ''Doctor Who'' production office was inundated by letters and calls asking about the creatures. Newspaper articles focused attention on the series and the Daleks, further enhancing their popularity.<ref name="dalek companion"/>

Nation jointly owned the intellectual property rights to the Daleks with the BBC, and the money-making concept proved nearly impossible to sell to anyone else; he was dependent on the BBC wanting to produce stories featuring the creatures.<ref name="dioe notes">On-screen production notes, ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' London, UK: BBC Video, 2003.</ref> Despite fans' adoration, the Daleks were clearly associated with ''Doctor Who'' and several attempts to market the Daleks outside of the series were unsuccessful.<ref>Peel (1988), p. 56</ref><ref>Howe (1997), p. 86</ref> <!-- The sums of money required to pay Nation for the use of his creations also explained why their appearances in the programme were rare in the late 1970s and 1980s.{{cn}}--> Since Nation's death in 1997, his share of the rights now belong to his estate and are administered by his former agent, Tim Hancock.<ref name="daleksback">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3535588.stm|title=Daleks back to fight Doctor Who|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=[[2004-08-04]]|accessdate=2006-12-15}}</ref>

Early plans for what eventually became the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 ''Doctor Who'' television movie]] included radically redesigned Daleks whose cases unfolded like spiders' legs.<ref>Segal (2000), pp. 48<U+2013>53</ref>  The concept for these "[[Dalek variants#Spider Dalek|Spider Daleks]]" was abandoned, but picked up again in several [[Doctor Who spin-offs|''Doctor Who'' spin-offs]].

{{main|History of the Daleks}}
[[Image:Davros.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Davros]], creator of the Daleks]]

Dalek in-universe history has seen many [[retcon|retroactive changes]], which have caused [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] problems.<ref>Peel (1998), p. 78</ref> When the Daleks first appeared in ''The Daleks'', they were presented as the descendants of the Dals, mutated after a brief nuclear war between the Dal and [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thal]] races.<ref name=B>''[[The Daleks]].'' Writer [[Terry Nation]], Director [[Christopher Barry]], Producer [[Verity Lambert]]. ''[[Doctor Who]]''. [[BBC]], London. [[December 21]], [[1963]]<U+2013>[[February 1]], [[1964]].</ref> However, in 1975, Terry Nation revised the Daleks' origins in ''Genesis of the Daleks'', where the Dals were now called [[Kaled]]s (of which Daleks is an [[anagram]]), and the Dalek design was attributed to one man, the crippled Kaled chief scientist and [[villain|evil genius]], [[Davros]].<ref name=Genesis>''[[Genesis of the Daleks]].'' Writer [[Terry Nation]], Director [[David Maloney]], Producer [[Philip Hinchcliffe]]. ''[[Doctor Who]]''. [[BBC]]. [[BBC1]], London. [[March 8]]<U+2013>[[April 12]], [[1975]].</ref> Instead of a short nuclear exchange, the Kaled-Thal war was portrayed as a thousand-year-long war of [[attrition warfare|attrition]], fought with nuclear, [[biological weapon|biological]] and [[chemical weapon]]s causing widespread mutations among the Kaled race. Davros experimented on living Kaled cells to find the ultimate mutated form of the Kaled species and placed the subjects in [[tank]]-like "travel machines" whose design was based on his own life-support chair. 

''Genesis of the Daleks'' marked a new era for the depiction of the species, with most of their previous history either forgotten or barely referred to again.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/dalekhistory2.shtml |title=The second history of the Daleks |accessdate=2007-01-24 |last=Cornell |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Cornell |coauthors=[[Martin Day]] and [[Keith Topping]] |year=1995 |work=Official Doctor Who website |publisher=BBC}}</ref> Future stories in the original ''Doctor Who'' series, which followed a rough [[story arc]],<ref>Parkin (2006), p. 237</ref> would also focus more on Davros, much to the dissatisfaction of some fans who felt that the Daleks should take centre stage,<ref name="companion 13">{{cite book

This serial also marked the last on-screen appearance of the Daleks until 2005, save for charity specials like ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'' and the use of Dalek voices in the 1996 television movie.

A single Dalek appeared in "Dalek", written by [[Rob Shearman|Robert Shearman]], which was broadcast on [[BBC One]] on [[30 April]] [[2005]]. This Dalek appeared to be the sole Dalek survivor of a [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] that had destroyed both the Daleks and the Time Lords.<ref name=Dalek (episode) /> Some other Daleks did survive, however. The [[Dalek variants#Dalek Emperor|Dalek Emperor]] returned at the end of the 2005 series, having rebuilt the Dalek race with human subjects; it saw itself as a god, and the new Daleks were shown worshipping it. These Daleks and their fleet were reduced to subatomic particles in "The Parting of the Ways".<ref name=Parting />

[[Image:Human dalek.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A Dalek-Human hybrid, from "[[Daleks in Manhattan]]"]]
The 2006 series finale saw another squad of Dalek survivors from the old Empire, known as the [[Cult of Skaro]], led by a [[Dalek variants#Dalek Supreme|black-enameled Dalek]] named "[[Dalek Sec]]", that had survived the Time War by escaping into the [[List of Doctor Who planets#Others|Void]] between dimensions. They emerged, along with a Time Lord prison containing millions of Daleks, at Canary Wharf due to the actions of the [[Torchwood Institute]] and [[Cyberman#Parallel Earth and the Battle of Canary Wharf|Cybermen from a parallel world]], leading to a Cyberman-Dalek clash in London. Eventually, the [[Tenth Doctor]] caused both factions to be sucked back into the Void, but the Cult members survived by "temporal shifting" away. The two-part story "[[Daleks in Manhattan]]"/"[[Evolution of the Daleks]]" revealed they had escaped to 1930 New York, setting up base in the [[Empire State Building]]. Experiments led by Sec are attempting to force a Dalek evolution by crossing their DNA with humans, and he is the first of the new "Human Daleks". However the three remaining Daleks rebelled and destroyed him.<ref name=Manhattan/> The Cult also attempted to create a Human/Dalek hybrid (fully human in appearance but with Dalek minds). This attempt failed after the Doctor interfered, and the hybrids were destroyed by Caan after they killed Jast and Thay; Caan escaped via another temporal shift.

==Dalek culture==
Daleks have little to no individual personality,<ref name=Doomsday /> ostensibly no emotions outside hatred,<ref name=Dalek (episode) /> and a strict command structure, conditioned to obey superior orders.<ref name=Evil>''[[The Evil of the Daleks]].'' Writer [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]], Director [[Derek Martinus]], Producer [[Innes Lloyd]]. ''[[Doctor Who]]''. [[BBC]]. [[BBC1]], London. [[May 20]]<U+2013>[[July 1]], [[1967]].</ref> Dalek speech is characterised by repeated phrases, and by orders given to themselves and to others. Dalek vocal inflection suggests perpetual anger, sometimes verging on hysteria. 

The fundamental feature of Dalek culture and psychology is an unquestioned belief in the superiority of the Dalek race<ref name=Evil /> and their default directive is to destroy all non-Dalek lifeforms.<ref name=Dalek (episode) /> Other species are either to be exterminated immediately, or enslaved and then exterminated later once they are no longer necessary.<ref name=Resurrection>''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]].''

The Dalek obsession with their own superiority is illustrated by the schism between the Renegade and Imperial Daleks seen in ''Remembrance of the Daleks'': the two factions consider the other to be a perversion despite the relatively minor differences between them.<ref name=Remembrance>''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]].''

In "The Parting of the Ways", the Daleks that were resurrected through the manipulation and mutation of human genetic material by the Dalek Emperor were religious fanatics that worshipped their Emperor as their god. The Doctor theorised that these Daleks were also insane due to self-loathing, as they had been created from human genetic material. He also noted that, prior to this encounter, no Dalek had a conception of blasphemy, as they had no religion or tolerance for it.<ref name=Parting /> The secret order of Daleks, above and beyond the Emperor, known as "The [[Cult of Skaro]]" who were created by the Emperor to imagine new ways of surviving appeared in the "Doomsday" episode (it is unclear if the Emperor Dalek that ordered their creation is the same as appeared in "The Parting of the Ways" or another Emperor Dalek); they included Dalek Jast, Dalek Caan, Dalek Thay, and their leader, the black Dalek, Dalek Sec. The Tenth Doctor noted that these Daleks were unique in their culture, granted the right to bear names and imaginations that set them apart from the other Daleks.<ref name=Doomsday/> These Daleks even express sorrow for the loss of their planet, break their normal obsession with hierarchy and are willing to sacrifice their own sense of "purity" for their kind.<ref name=Manhattan/>    

[[Image:kafaraqgatri.jpg|thumb|300px|The Daleks face their bogeyman, the Doctor. From the comic strip ''Metamorphosis'', art by Lee Sullivan]]
Although the Daleks are well known for their disregard of [[due process]], there have been two enemies that they have taken back to Skaro for a "trial", rather than immediately killed; the first was their creator, [[Davros]], in ''Revelation of the Daleks'',<ref name=Revelation>''[[Revelation of the Daleks]].'' Writer [[Eric Saward]], Director [[Graeme Harper]], Producer [[John Nathan-Turner]]. ''[[Doctor Who]]''. [[BBC]]. [[BBC1]], London.

Writer [[Matthew Jacobs]], Director [[Geoffrey Sax]], Executive Producer [[Philip Segal]]. 1996. DVD.

The reasons for the Master's trial, and why the Doctor would be asked to retrieve the Master's remains, have never been explained on screen; the ''Doctor Who Annual 2006'' implies that the trial may have been due to a treaty signed between the Time Lords and the Daleks.<ref>[[Russell T. Davies|Davies, Russell T.]] "Meet the Doctor." ''Doctor Who Annual 2006''. Ed. [[Clayton Hickman]]. [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]]: [[Panini Comics|Panini]], 2005. pp. 20<U+2013>21.</ref> The framing device for the ''[[I, Davros: Purity|I, Davros]]'' audio plays, is a Dalek trial to determine if Davros should be the Daleks' leader once more.<ref>''[[I, Davros: Innocence]]''.

The spin-off novels contain several [[tongue-in-cheek]] mentions of Dalek poetry (and an anecdote about an opera based upon it, which was lost to posterity when the entire cast was exterminated on opening night). Two stanzas are given in the novel ''[[The Also People]]'' by Ben Aaronovitch.<ref>Aaronovitch (1995), p. 199</ref>  In an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative timeline]] portrayed in [[Big Finish Productions]] audio adventure ''[[The Time of the Daleks]]'', the Daleks show a fondness for the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].<ref>''[[The Time of the Daleks]]''. Writer [[Justin Richards]], Director [[Nicholas Briggs]], Producers [[Gary Russell]] and [[Jason Haigh-Ellery]]. [[Big Finish Productions]], 2002.</ref>

Because the Doctor has defeated the Daleks so often, he has become their [[Archenemy|arch-enemy]] and they  have standing orders to capture or exterminate him on sight. They are occasionally able to identify him despite his [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Changing faces|regenerations]]. In the comic strips and novels the Daleks know the Doctor as the "Ka Faraq Gatri": the "Bringer of Darkness" or "Destroyer of Worlds" (this was first established in the novelisation of ''Remembrance of the Daleks'' by [[Ben Aaronovitch]]).<ref>Aaronovitch (1990), p. 26</ref>  In "[[The Parting of the Ways]]", the Doctor says that the Daleks call him "The Oncoming Storm"<ref name=Parting /> <U+2014> this name was used by the [[Draconian (Doctor Who)|Draconians]] (whose word for it is "Karshtakavaar") to refer to the Doctor in the Virgin New Adventures novel ''[[Love and War (Doctor Who)|Love and War]]'' by [[Paul Cornell]].<ref>Cornell (1992), p. 32</ref> 

The modern Doctor has come to view the Daleks as completely evil and unworthy of trust or compassion. This contrasts with some of the Doctor's earlier dealings with the Daleks: the Second Doctor attempted to instil a "human factor" in Daleks in ''The Evil of the Daleks''<ref name=Evil /> and the Fourth Doctor hesitated when presented with the opportunity to destroy the Daleks at the point of their creation in ''Genesis of the Daleks''.<ref name=Genesis /> The Ninth Doctor made a venomous outburst, due to the destruction of [[Gallifrey]], in "Dalek", leading the lone mutant in that episode to observe that the Doctor "would make a good Dalek", but, when forced to destroy the Dalek race and Earth along with it, noted he'd rather be a "coward, any day."<ref name=Dalek (episode) /> The Tenth Doctor, whilst initially suspicious and dismissing the Cult of Skaro's genetic dabblings as having acheived nothing, showed compassion to the Dalek/Human hybrid Dalek Sec's plan to create a more benign Dalek race on another planet, and was even willing to transport them there via the [[TARDIS]].<ref name=Manhattan/>

==Licensed appearances==
[[Image:dalekmovieposter.jpg|thumb|300px|The poster for ''[[Dr. Who and the Daleks]]'']]
Two ''Doctor Who'' movies starring [[Peter Cushing]] featured the Daleks as the main villains: ''[[Dr. Who and the Daleks]]'', and ''[[Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 AD]]'', based on the television serials ''The Daleks'' and ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'', respectively. However, the movies were not straight remakes. Cushing's Doctor is not an alien, but a human inventor literally named "Doctor Who," who invented his time/space machine (which he directly called "Tardis" instead of "''the'' TARDIS"). The movies used brand new Dalek props, based closely on the original design but with a wider range of colours. Originally, the movie Daleks were supposed to shoot jets of flame, but this was thought to be too graphic for children, so their weapons emitted jets of deadly vapour instead.

Nation also authorised the publication of the comic strip ''The Daleks'' in the comic ''[[TV Century 21]]'' in 1965.<ref>Howe (1992), p. 143</ref>  The one-page strip (written by [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]] but credited to Nation) featured the Daleks as protagonists and "heroes", and continued for two years, from their creation of the mechanised Daleks by the humanoid Dalek scientist, Yarvelling, to their eventual discovery in the ruins of a crashed space-liner of the co-ordinates for [[Earth]], which they proposed to invade. Although much of the material in these strips directly contradicted what was shown on television later, some concepts like the Daleks using humanoid duplicates and the design of the [[Dalek variants|Dalek Emperor]] did show up later on in the programme. In 1994, the [[Marvel UK|UK arm]] of [[Marvel Comics]] reprinted all the ''TV 21'' strips in a collected edition titled ''The Dalek Chronicles''.

At the same time, a ''Doctor Who'' strip was also being published in ''[[TV Comic]]''. Initially, the strip did not have the rights to use the Daleks, so the [[First Doctor]] battled the "Trods" instead, cone-shaped robotic creatures that ran on static electricity that were obviously based on the Daleks. By the time the [[Second Doctor]] appeared in the strip in 1967 the rights issues had been resolved, and the Daleks began making appearances starting in ''The Trodos Ambush'' (TVC #788-#791), where they massacred the Trods. The Daleks also made appearances in the [[Third Doctor]]-era ''Dr. Who'' comic strip that featured in the combined ''[[Countdown (comic)|Countdown]]/[[TV Action (comic)|TV Action]]'' comic during the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/tvaction3.htm |title=Countdown / TV Action Strips and Stories featuring the Third Doctor |accessdate=2006-11-28 |last=Boies |first=Dominique |work=Doctor Who Reference Guide}}</ref>

Beginning in 1979, [[Marvel UK]] published ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'', which included comic strip stories in its pages. The Doctor occasionally fought the Daleks in the main ''DWM'' strip, and a new nemesis was introduced in a recurring back-up strip: [[Abslom Daak]], Dalek Killer. Daak was a convicted criminal in the 25th Century who was given the choice between execution and being sent on a suicide mission against the Daleks. He chose the latter and, when the woman he loved was killed by the Daleks, made it his life's purpose to kill every one of the creatures he came across.

The Daleks have also appeared in the ''Dalek Empire'' series of audio plays by [[Big Finish Productions]].  Three mini-series, totalling 14 CDs, have so far been produced; these saw the return of the original Dalek Emperor. The Daleks have also returned to bedevil the Doctor in Big Finish's ''Doctor Who'' line of audio plays and [[Bernice Summerfield]] in ''[[Death and the Daleks]]''.

Dalek toys are seen in a [[department store]] in "Death at Bargain Prices", a 1965 episode of the fantasy/thriller series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', which like ''Doctor Who'' was created by Sydney Newman, although broadcast on the rival [[ITV]] network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theavengers.tv/forever/peel1-4.htm|title=Death at Bargain Prices|publisher=The Avengers Forever|first=David K.|last=Smith|date=[[2006-01-05]]|accessdate=2006-12-18}}</ref>

In the comic [[television documentary]] ''[[Red Dwarf|The Red Dwarf A-Z]]'', two Daleks are shown (under "E" for "Exterminate") arguing that all Earth television is human propaganda, and the works more commonly attributed to [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] were actually written by Daleks. After this, one of them remarks that the "change the bulb" joke from "[[Legion (Red Dwarf episode)|Legion]]" was funny, and is promptly exterminated by the other for the crime of "not behaving like a true Dalek".<ref>{{cite video

A 2001 British [[Kit Kat]] advertisement featured a squad of Daleks who have joined a group of [[Hare Krishna]] devotees, rolling through a shopping centre and repeatedly chanting "Peace and love!" and "Give us a cuddle" in their distinctive voices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.aol.com/dalektable/kitkat.html |title=Daleks and the Kit Kat advert |accessdate=2007-01-19 |last=Balcombe |first=Chris |work=personal website of the Dalek operator}}</ref> 

In the 2004 series of ''[[Coupling (TV series)|Coupling]]'', written by [[Steven Moffat]] (who later wrote for ''Doctor Who''), a Dalek appears in the second episode of season four.<ref name="coupling">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/06_june/16/coupling_moffat.shtml|title=Writer Steven Moffat|publisher=[[bbc.co.uk|BBC Press Office]]|date=[[2004-06-16]]|accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> This was voiced by [[Nicholas Briggs]], who later went on to provide Dalek voices for the series proper from 2005 onwards.<ref name="coupling2">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0109070/|title=Nicholas Briggs|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|date=2007-01-24}}</ref> Terry Nation's original Dalek rights deal with the BBC had been negotiated by his then agent [[Beryl Vertue]], later ''Coupling'' writer Moffat's mother-in-law.<ref name="moffat">{{cite news | url= http://media.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1293784,00.html | title= Monkey goes to Edinburgh | publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]]|format=Requires free registration | date=[[2004-08-31]]|accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref>

In the 2003 film ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]],'' two Cushing movie-style Daleks made a cameo appearance in the "[[Area 51|Area 52]]" segment amidst many famous "old-time" movie monsters. A Dalek also appears (along with the ''[[Lost in Space]]'' robot) in a 2005 television advertisement for the [[Australia and New Zealand Banking Group|ANZ]] bank in Australia - The Dalek was replaced by a giant toy robot in later ANZ Ads.

In a 2004 episode of ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'', two black Daleks were featured on a segment where the [[Sixth Doctor]] (played by [[Colin Baker]]), a [[Cyberman]], [[Darth Vader]], [[Ming the Merciless]] and a [[Klingon]] each participated on a one-lap run on the ''Top Gear'' track in a [[Honda Civic]] hatchback. When it was time for one of the Daleks to drive the Civic, it analyzed the car's interior and went berserk upon seeing that only humanoid forms could drive it. As a result, both Daleks went on a rampage and exterminated the other villains on the track.

===Parodies===
:''See also: [[Doctor Who spoofs]]''.

Daleks have been the subject of many [[parody|parodies]], including [[Spike Milligan]]'s "[[Doctor Who spoofs#Pakistani Dalek, 1975|Pakistani Dalek]]" sketch in his comedy series ''[[Q (Spike Milligan series)|Q]]'',<ref name="crapsketch">{{cite news|title=Q6 - BBC2|publisher=[[The Times]]|first=Alan|last=Coren|authorlink=Alan Coren|date=[[1975-12-12]]|accessdate=2007-01-25|pages=14}}</ref> and [[Victor Lewis-Smith]]'s [[gay]] Daleks. One sketch on ''[[Dave Allen At Large]]'' portrayed a [[baptismal font]] behaving like a Dalek. ''Doctor Who'' itself has used the Daleks for parody: in 2002, [[BBC Worldwide]] published the ''Dalek Survival Guide'', a parody of ''[[Worst-Case Scenario series|The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbooks]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Richards |first=Justin |authorlink=Justin Richards |coauthors=[[Nicholas Briggs]], [[Stephen Cole (writer)|Stephen Cole]], [[Jacqueline Rayner]] and [[Mike Tucker]] |editor=Ben Dunn (editor)|title=Dalek Survival Guide |year=2002 |publisher=[[BBC Worldwide]] |location=London |isbn=0-563-48600-7 }}</ref>

On [[BBC Radio 4]], the Daleks made occasional appearances on the satirical impressionist show ''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'', noting that the proliferation of wheelchair ramps would make it easier for Daleks to invade Earth. Other sketches included them trying to buy skin-care products for Davros's wrinkled skin. Dalek voices have frequently appeared on another BBC Radio 4 satirical programme, ''[[The Now Show]]''. <!--The return of the Daleks to television was celebrated in 2004 on the programme by comedy songwriter [[Mitch Benn]], who penned a special Dalek-themed song for the occasion.{{fact}}-->

In one of the audio [[bloopers]] released for the [[computer game]] ''[[Black & White (computer game)|Black & White]]'', the voice actor speaking a high-pitched, shrieking character jokingly claims he can't stop talking in that voice. He then tries to warn the producer about what would happen if his voice went any higher, but interrupts himself by saying "EXTERMINATE THE DOCTOR" in a Dalek-like voice.<ref name="B&WOuttakes">{{cite web

===Politics===
In a [[Her Majesty's Government|British Government]] [[Parliamentary Debate]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on [[12 February]] [[1968]], the then [[Minister of Technology]] [[Tony Benn]] mentioned the Daleks during a reply to a question from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] [[Hugh Jenkins]] concerning the [[Concorde]] aircraft project. In the context of the dangers of [[solar flare]]s, he said, "Because we are exploring the frontiers of technology, some people think Concorde will be avoiding solar flares like Dr. Who avoiding Daleks. It is not like this at all."<ref name="benn">{{cite news|title=The Commons: cost of Concorde: market for Beagles|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=[[1968-02-13]]|accessdate=2007-01-14|pages=5}}</ref> An earlier political reference occurred at the 1966 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] conference in [[Blackpool]], where delegate [[Hugh Dykes, Baron Dykes|Hugh Dykes]] publicly compared the Labour government's [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretary]] [[Denis Healey]] to the creatures. "Mr. Healey is the Dalek of defence, pointing a metal finger at the armed forces and saying 'I will eliminate you'."<ref name="healy">{{cite news|title=Defence - Mr Healey 'The Dalek'|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=[[1966-10-15]]|accessdate=2007-01-14|pages=13}}</ref>

===Music===
[[Image:I'm Gonna Spend My Christmas With A Dalek.jpg|140px|right|thumb|The cover of the 1964 novelty single "I'm Gonna Spend My Christmas With A Dalek" by [[The Go-Go's (1960s)|The Go-Go's]].]]<!--FAIR USE of I'm Gonna Spend My Christmas With A Dalek.jpg; see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:I%27m_Gonna_Spend_My_Christmas_With_A_Dalek.jpg for rationale-->

The first known musical reference to Daleks is the 1964 novelty single "I'm Gonna Spend My Christmas With A Dalek" by [[The Go-Go's (1960s)|The Go-Go's]], released during the 1960s' "[[Dalekmania]]" fad.<ref>Howe (1992), p. 148</ref>  As part of their light show in the 1960s, [[Pink Floyd]] used a light which they dubbed the "Dalek", due to its erratic behaviour and tendency to break down.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pink-floyd.org/artint/25.htm |title=Welcome to the machine |accessdate=2007-01-21 |last=McHugh |first=Catherine |year=1994 |month=September |work=Lighting Dimensions}}</ref> (the version of Pink Floyd's ''[[One of These Days]]'' on the [[Delicate Sound of Thunder]] live album also briefly quotes the Doctor Who theme tune). In [[The Clash]]'s song "[[Remote Control (song)|Remote Control]]" (from their [[The Clash (album)|self-titled 1977 album]]), the last verse includes the lines, "''Repression <U+2014> gonna be a Dalek / Repression <U+2014> I am a robot / Repression <U+2014> I obey.''"<ref name="clash">{{cite web|url=http://lyriki.com/index.php?title=The_Clash:Remote_Control|title=Remote Control|publisher=Lyriki|accessdate=2007-02-20}}</ref>

The band [[Shriekback]] had a musical reference in their 1985 album [[Oil & Gold]] in the song "Hammerheads."  Singer Barry Andrew declares, "''This is our mission; to be the Daleks of God!''". [[The Shapes]]' "Let's Go To Planet Skaro" is set entirely on the Daleks' homeworld, where the Doctor is holding his wedding reception.  The single "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]" by ''Doctor Who''-themed group [[The Timelords]] included various Dalek vocalisations, and its [[music video]] featured a late-model sedan (dubbed "a [[Ford]] Timelord") crashing into a crudely constructed Dalek. 

[[Rotersand]], a European [[synthpop]]/[[industrial music|industrial]] band, lifted out a Single entitled ''Exterminate Annihilate Destroy'' from their Album "Welcome to Goodbye", prominently featuring a sound sample of a Dalek repeating the title phrase. The short-lived punk act, [[The Art Attacks]], released a single with the song, "I am a Dalek" in 1978 for Albatross Records. Additionally, at least three musical acts have named themselves after the Daleks: the late 1970s [[synth pop]] group [[Dalek I Love You]], The Daleks, a [[punk rock]] band who recorded one single in 1980, and D<U+00E4>lek, an underground [[hip-hop]] act that released three albums on Ipecac Recordings between [[2002]] and [[2007]].<ref name="dalek_ipecac">{{cite web|url=http://www.ipecac.com/bio.php?id=12|title=Dalek Artist Bio|publisher=Ipecac Records|accessdate=2007-07-11}}</ref>

[[MC Frontalot]], a [[nerdcore hip hop]] artist, [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] the Dalek's infamous "Exterminate" catchphrase in the title track of his 2005 album "Nerdcore Rising" during a verse performed by [[MC Hawking]].

===Pornography===
Daleks have made their way into pornographic material. For example, a Dalek appeared with a naked [[Katy Manning]] (who played the [[Third Doctor]]'s companion [[Jo Grant]]) in a photoshoot for ''[[Playboy]]'' after Manning left the series.<ref name=porn>Howe (1996), pp. 60<U+2013>61, 66</ref> Although ''Playboy'' did not use the images, they were eventually published in a short-lived Australian men's magazine named ''Girl Illustrated''.<ref name=porn />

Daleks were also featured in an unauthorized pornographic feature, ''Abducted by the Daloids'' (although the disc itself uses "Daleks"). In the film, the "Daloids" (portrayed by several Dalek models) abduct three scantily-clad models and watch [[lesbian]] scenes. The BBC took action to prevent sale of the DVD when learning of it in November 2005.<ref>{{cite news |first=Lester |last=Haines |title=BBC pulls plug on Dalek lesbian romp flick |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/11/28/dalek_film/ |work=[[The Register]] |date=[[2005-11-28]] |accessdate=2006-11-28 }}</ref> Another pornographic parody, entitled ''Dr. Loo and the Filthy Phaleks'' was released earlier in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477624/ |title=Dr. Loo and the Filthy Phaleks |accessdate=2006-11-28 |work=[[Internet Movie Database]] }}</ref>

===Stand Up Comedy===
The Daleks have also been featured in a comedy routine by [[England|English]] comedian/transvestite [[Eddie Izzard]], from his album, [[Live at the Ambassadors]].

==Merchandising==
The BBC approached Walter Tuckwell, a [[New Zealand]]-born entrepreneur who was handling product merchandising for other BBC shows, and asked him to do the same for the Daleks and ''Doctor Who''.<ref name="tuckwell">Howe (1994), p. 342</ref> Tuckwell created a glossy sales brochure that sparked off a Dalek craze, dubbed "Dalekmania" by the press, which peaked around the time ''The Chase'' aired in June 1965.

===Toys===
[[Image:DSCF2285.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Dalek figurine]]
The first Dalek toy from Louis Marx & Co., a battery-operated Dalek, appeared in 1964.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skaro.org/toys.htm |title=Toys and Puppets |accessdate=2006-11-28 |last=Hicks |first=David |year=2000 |work=The Skaro Toy Museum}}</ref> More toys and merchandise appeared the following year, along with toys of the Mechanoids (robotic foes of the Daleks also introduced in ''The Chase''). The Mechanoids were created with the expectation that they would become as popular as Daleks, but they were not as successful.<ref>Howe (1992), pp. 43, 151</ref> Other unsuccessful BBC attempts to create a "replacement" for the Daleks, or at least duplicate their popularity included the Voord (''[[The Keys of Marinus]]'', 1964), the Krotons (''[[The Krotons]]'', 1968) and the Quarks (''[[The Dominators]]'', 1968).

At the height of the Daleks' popularity, apart from toy replicas, there were also Dalek construction kits, Dalek board games and activity sets, Dalek slide projectors for children and even Dalek playsuits made from PVC.<ref name="merchandise">Howe (1992), pp. 137<U+2013>152</ref> There were collectible cards, stickers, toy guns, music singles, punching bags and many other items.<ref name="merchandise" /> Between 1963 and 1965, the BBC published three annuals with short stories and comic strips featuring the Daleks, written by Whitaker and Nation.<ref name="merchandise"/> The ''Dalek Annual'' was revived in 1976 and 1977, with stories and selected reprints from the ''TV 21'' comic strip.<ref>Howe (1992), p. 157</ref>

In the 1970s, Palitoy released a Talking Dalek which could utter standard Dalek phrases such as "You will obey!" and "Exterminate!" Later, model kits of other Dalek-related characters like Davros, the Supreme Dalek and Gold Daleks were also released. In 2001 a new range of talking Daleks were produced, along with a talking [[Cyberman]] and a talking Davros. 

In 2005, new Dalek toys, including a remote-controlled, talking Dalek and a pair of battling Daleks, were also created based on the designs for the new series. These were unexpectedly popular and were sold out in many stores in the UK. A remote-controlled Dalek based on the white-and-gold Imperial Dalek design was also released.

===Computer games===
[[Image:dalekattackgame.jpg|thumb|200px|''Dalek Attack'' (1992), from Admiral Software]]
The Daleks have featured in computer games since the 1980s, beginning with an unlicensed modification of the ''[[Robots (computer game)|Robots]]'' game called ''[[Daleks (video game)|Daleks]]''. However, the game uses Daleks only as generic monsters, with no Dalek-specific features.  Similarly, the 1985 game ''[[Paradroid]]'' includes a robot ("Droid 883") which resembles a Dalek: the game's background info mentions that the source design was "modelled from archive data" and that its appearance frightens humans.  [[:Image:Alien 8 7.gif|One of the enemies]] in ''[[Alien 8]]'' appears to be half-mouse, half-Dalek.

Licensed ''Doctor Who'' games featuring Daleks include 1984's ''The Key to Time'', a text adventure game for the [[ZX Spectrum]]. Daleks also appeared in minor roles or as thinly disguised versions in other, minor games throughout the 80s, but did not feature as central adversaries in a licensed game until 1992, when Admiral Software published ''[[Dalek Attack]]''. The game allowed the player to play various Doctors or companions, running them through several environments to defeat the Daleks. In 1997 the BBC released a [[Personal computer|PC]] game entitled ''[[Destiny of the Doctors]]'' which also featured the Daleks, among other adversaries, who also seemed to be able to follow the player character up the stairs. In 1998 the BBC released a ''Doctor Who'' [[screensaver]] done in [[Macromedia Shockwave]] which had a built-in minigame, where the player controlled [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]] battling the Daleks through seven increasingly difficult levels. 

Unauthorized games featuring Daleks continued to appear through the 1990s and 2000s, including Dalek-based [[mod (computer gaming)|modifications]] of ''[[Dark Forces]]'', ''[[Quake]]'', and ''[[Half-Life]]'', and even more recently, a mod of ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]''; many of these can be found online.  Other unauthorised online Dalek games include a [[DHTML]]/[[JavaScript]] arcade game ''Dalek''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.def-logic.com/dalek/dalek.html  |title=Dalek |accessdate=2006-11-30 |author=Silby, Brent |year=2005 |format=[[JavaScript]] |publisher=Def-Logic Videogames}}</ref> and an [[Adobe Flash]] game, ''Dalek:Dissolution Earth''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adsonourfridge.com/pixelpie/dalek.html  |title=Dalek: Dissolution Earth |accessdate=2006-11-30 |format=[[Adobe Flash]] }}</ref>. In 1998 ''QWho'', a [[mod (computer gaming)|modification]] for ''[[Quake]]'', featured the Daleks as adversaries. This also formed the basis of ''TimeQuake'', a [[total conversion]] written in 2000 which included other ''Doctor Who'' monsters such as [[Sontaran]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.otranto.demon.co.uk/timequake/ |title=Doctor Who - Timequake |accessdate=2006-11-30 |last=Williams |first=Giles |coauthors=Christian Darkin and Conrad Feinson |date=[[2000-08-11]] }}</ref> Another unauthorised game is ''DalekTron'', a Windows-only game based on [[Robotron: 2084]] and written in the [[Smalltalk]] programming language to coincide with the 2005 series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dalektron.org/ |title=DalekTron |accessdate=2006-11-30 |last=Bower |first=Andy |coauthors=and James Bower |date=[[2006-03-27]]}}</ref>

One authorised online game is ''The Last Dalek'', a [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] game created by New Media Collective for the BBC. It is based on the 2005 episode "Dalek" and can be played at the official BBC ''Doctor Who'' website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/games/lastdalek/index.shtml |title=The Last Dalek |accessdate=2006-11-30  |format=[[Adobe Flash]] |work=BBC ''Doctor Who'' website |publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]] }}</ref> The ''Doctor Who'' website also features another game ''Daleks vs Cybermen'' (also known as ''Cyber Troop Control Interface'') in which the player controls troops of Cybermen which must fight Daleks as well as [[Torchwood Institute]] members based on the 2006 episode "Doomsday".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/games/game13/index.shtml |title=Cyber Troop Control Interface |accessdate=2007-01-19  |format=[[Adobe Flash]] |work=BBC ''Doctor Who'' website |publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]] }}</ref>.
