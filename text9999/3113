Three days into her run in the Egyptian Sahara, Samantha was attacked. She was dragged into the bushes by a man who was waiting on her side of the course. Luckily a moped drove by before he was able to assault her.<ref name=":0" />

Samantha completed the 4 Desert Grand Slam in 2010.<ref name=":1" /> covering a total of 1,000&nbsp;km across deserts in Chile, Egypt, China and the Antarctic.<ref name=":0" />

She used a 379&nbsp;km non-stop run across the 
Simpson Desert to raise money for an education program with Save the 
Children. The social enterprise business Samantha and fellow Ultra-Marathoner, Mimi Anderson, started will gainfully employ a dozen South 
African women to manufacture feminine hygiene products that will be 
distributed at low cost to around 1500 school girls in the community. Samantha Gash (29 years of age from Australia) is running 2350&nbsp;km across South Africa. The run will take 32 days and we plan to run an average of 80&nbsp;km every day - that is 
64 back to back marathons.<ref name=":2" />
