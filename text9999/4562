'''''NHL 2005''''', the successor to ''[[NHL 2004]]'', is a [[Ice hockey|hockey]] video game first released on September 14, 2004 in North America and September 24, 2004 in the PAL region.

==Features==
===Improvements/flaws===
''NHL 2005'' features ''Open Ice Control'', which according to EA allows better control, including moving players without the puck and also a complete [[World Cup of Hockey|World Cup]] mode where each team can be created from scratch. For the first time, the user was allowed to import digitized home arenas for the scratchbuilt teams (the 30 NHL arenas plus [[Nuremberg Arena]], [[K<U+00F6>lnarena]], [[Stockholm Globe Arena]], Helsinki [[Hartwall Areena]] and Prague [[Sazka Arena]] were available). Additional NHL jerseys and logos were also available including those of the defunct [[Atlanta Flames]], [[Winnipeg Jets (1972<U+2013>96)|Winnipeg Jets]], [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)]], [[Quebec Nordiques]] as well as the old style [[Los Angeles Kings]], [[Washington Capitals]] and [[Vancouver Canucks]] uniforms of the [[1970s]] and the [[1980s]]. 

The IIHF license which granted the World Cup mode also allowed EA to use real-life international jerseys for the only time (previously released games used unique jerseys designed by the game's staff which only bore a passing similarity to their real life counterparts, so the jersey shows their flag.) The PC version of the game was stripped down to the bare essentials, including the omitting of the create-a-player feature. These omissions were possibly due to the labour dispute that season, but EA explained that they hadn't perfected the new create-a-player interface, which would have allowed for far greater customizability that what was previously available.

===Information===
''NHL 2005'' is also the only EA's NHL PC game that lacks the ability to view league wide statistics when playing in season mode. [[Vancouver Canucks]] captain [[Markus N<U+00E4>slund|Markus Naslund]] is featured on the cover, except in Finland where [[Olli Jokinen]] is on the cover. ''NHL 2005'' is also the first EA Sports NHL title to be online enabled for the Xbox system.
