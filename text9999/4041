The '''Boston and Montana Consolidated Copper and Silver Mining Company''' (the "Boston and Montana" or "B&M") was a [[mining]], [[Smelter|smelting]], and [[Refinery|refining]] company which operated primarily in the state of [[Montana]] in the [[United States]]. It was established in 1887 and merged with the [[Anaconda Copper|Amalgamated Copper Company]] in 1901. The Amalgamated Copper Company changed its name to [[Anaconda Copper]] in 1910, and  became one of America's largest corporations.<ref name="Frederick106">Frederick, p. 106.</ref> Historian Michael P. Malone has written, "Well financed and well managed, the Boston and Montana came to rank among the world's greatest copper companies."<ref name="Malone48">Malone, 2006, p. 48.</ref>

==Corporate history==
[[Adolph Lewisohn|Adolph]] and [[Leonard Lewisohn]] were [[German people|German]] [[Jew]]s whose father had established in 1858 an American subsidiary, Lewisohn Brothers, which bought and sold bristles, feathers, hair, metals, and wood.<ref>Ingham, p. 792-793.</ref> In 1867, Adolph and Leonard emigrated to the United States and took over the company, focusing their attention on the trading of [[copper]], [[lead]], and [[zinc]].<ref name="Ingham793">Ingham, p. 793.</ref> In 1879, the brothers were invited to purchase some mines in [[Arizona]], Montana, and [[Tennessee]].<ref name="Ingham793" /> With $75,000, they organized the Montana Copper Company, the Tennessee Copper and Chemical Company, and the Miami Copper Company (in Arizona).<ref name="Ingham793" /> In 1887, Adolph and Leonard bought Lewisohn Brothers from their father and turned it into an independent company.<ref name="Ingham793" />

The Boston and Montana was organized on July 22, 1887, by the merger of Lewisohn Brothers, the Montana Copper Company, and the mine holdings of [[C. X. Larrabee]] (owner of the highly productive and famous Larrabee and Mountain View mines).<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A02E2DC1430E633A25750C2A9619C94669FD7CF "A Montana Mining Deal." ''New York Times.'' July 23, 1887]; [http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=FA0C15FE395412738DDDAF0894DB405B828CF1D3 "Death of Leonard Lewisohn." ''New York Times.'' March 6, 1902.]</ref> It quickly became the second-largest company in Montana (only the Anaconda Copper Company in [[Butte, Montana|Butte]] was larger).<ref name="Whitten127">Whitten and Whitten, p. 127.</ref> It owned mines in Arizona, [[Michigan]], Montana, and Tennessee.<ref name="Whitten127" /> For many years, it was managed by "Captain" Thomas Couch, a [[Cornish people|Cornish]] immigrant and expert miner.<ref name="Malone48" />

In Montana, the B&M relied heavily on copper mined from the Leonard and the Colusa mines, near Butte.<ref name="Malone48" /> The company owned a small smelter in Meaderville, a small town just east of Butte (now consumed by the [[Berkeley Pit]] mine).<ref name="Malone48" /> Other productive mines (the Badger State, Comanche, Liquidator, Mountain View, Pennsylvania, Wandering Jew, and West Colusa) now added their ores to the stream needing smelting and refining.<ref name="Malone49">Malone, 2006, p. 49.</ref> The Meaderville smelter was too small, and any smelter would need cheap power and lots of water. Leonard Lewisohn considered both [[Helena, Montana|Helena]] and [[Great Falls, Montana|Great Falls]] for his new smelter.<ref name="Malone49" />

The balance was tipped in favor of Great Falls due to several factors. First was the existence of a railroad to Great Falls. [[James Jerome Hill]], primary stockholder and president of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] had established a subsidiary, the [[Montana Central Railway]], on January 25, 1886.<ref name="Hidy57">Hidy, Hidy, and Scott, p. 57.</ref> Few railroads served Montana at that time. But Butte was a booming mining town that needed to get its metals to market, gold and silver had been discovered near Helena, and coal companies in [[Canada]] were eager to get their fuel to Montana's smelters.<ref name="Hidy57" /> Hill's close friend and business associate, [[Paris Gibson]], had founded the town of Great Falls on the [[Great Falls (Missouri River)|Great Falls of the Missouri River]] in 1883, and was promoting it as a site for the development of cheap [[hydroelectricity]] and heavy industry.<ref>Martin, p. xxi; Malone, 1996, p. 132; Guthrie, p. 20; Taliaferro, p. 120-121.</ref> Hill was building the Great Northern across the northern tier of Montana, and it made sense to build a north-south railroad through central Montana to connect Great Falls with Helena and Butte.<ref name="Hidy57" /> Surveyors and engineers had begun grading a route between Helena and Great Falls in the winter of 1885-1886 (even before the company had been incorporated), and by the end of 1886 had surveyed a route from Helena to Butte.<ref name="Hidy57" /> Construction on the Great Northern's line westward began in late 1886, and on October 16, 1887, the link beween [[Devils Lake, North Dakota]]; [[Fort Assinniboine]] (near the present-day city of [[Havre, Montana|Havre]]); and Great Falls was complete.<ref>Hidy, Hidy, and Scott, p. 57-60.</ref> Service to Helena began in November 1887, and Butte followed the next spring.<ref>Hidy, Hidy, and Scott, p. 60.</ref>

The second reason was Hill's own investment in the city of Great Falls. Hill organized the Great Falls Water Power & Townsite Company in 1887,<ref name="McCormick2" /><ref name="Almanac">''The Montana Almanac,'' p. 381.</ref> with the goal of developing the town of Great Falls; providing it with power, sewage, and water; and attracting commerce and industry to the city.<ref name="Almanac" /><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=4vMnAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22Great%20Falls%20Water%20Power%22%20dam%20Black%20Eagle&pg=PA223#v=onepage&q=%22Great%20Falls%20Water%20Power%22%20dam%20Black%20Eagle&f=false ''Report of the Bureau of Agriculture Labor and Industry of the State of Montana,'' p. 223.]</ref> To attract industry to the new city, he offered low rates on the Montana Central Railway.<ref>Strom, p. 151.</ref> In case cheap power, plenty of water, and low shipping rates were not enough of an inducement, Hill also gave Leonard Lewisohn 1,500 shares in the Great Falls Water Power & Townsite Company.<ref name="Malone49" />

On September 12, 1889, the Boston and Montana signed an agreement with Great Falls Water Power & Townsite Company in which the power company agreed to build a dam that would supply the mining firm with at least 1,000 horsepower (or 0.75 MW) of power by September 1, 1890, and 5,000 horsepower (or 3.73 MW) of power by January 1, 1891.<ref name="Hyde86">Hyde, p. 86.</ref><ref name="McCormick3">[http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/MT0400/ McCormick, p. 3.]</ref> In exchange, Boston and Montana agreed to build a $300,000 copper smelter near the dam.<ref name="Hyde86" /><ref name="McCormick2">[http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/MT0400/ McCormick, p. 2.]</ref> [[Black Eagle Dam]] began generating electricity in December 1890.<ref>Peterson, p. 86.</ref> Water was permitted to flow over the crest of the dam on January 6, 1891, and the dam was considered complete on March 15, 1891.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=80xDAAAAYAAJ&dq=Parker%20%22Black%20Eagle%20Falls%20Dam%22&pg=PA64#v=onepage&q=Parker%20%22Black%20Eagle%20Falls%20Dam%22&f=false Parker, p. 64.]</ref>

Ground was broken on the smelter in the spring of 1890.<ref name="Hofman">[http://books.google.com/books?id=JudfAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22Boston%20and%20Montana%22%20smelter%20%22Great%20Falls%22%201887&pg=PA267#v=onepage&q=%22Boston%20and%20Montana%22%20smelter%20%22Great%20Falls%22%201887&f=false Hofman, p. 267-269.]</ref> It was located on a bluff overlooking Black Eagle Dam next to the hamlet of [[Black Eagle, Montana]].

Along with Anaconda Copper, the [[Butte and Boston Consolidated Mining Company]],<ref>This company had been formed by the Lewisohn brothers and Albert S. Bigelow, a wealthy copper mine owner from Boston, Massachusetts.  It was created in February 1897, and had an interlocking board of directors with the Boston and Montana.  See: Malone, p. 48; McNeils, p. 211.</ref> and the [[Montana Ore Purchasing Company]], the Boston and Montana was the most powerful mining and refining concern in Montana in the early 1890s.<ref name="Frederick103">Frederick, p. 103.</ref> In 1890, 50 percent of all copper mined in the U.S. came from Montana.<ref name="Malone53">Malone, 2006, p. 53.</ref> In 1897, Anaconda Copper supplied {{convert|341500000|lb|kg}} of copper; Calumet and Hecla (in Michigan) supplied {{convert|88400000|lb|kg}} of copper; and the Boston and Montana {{convert|60000000|lb|kg}}.<ref name="Malone53" />

In 1899, [[Henry Huttleston Rogers]], a business associate of [[John D. Rockefeller]], proposed the creation of a giant copper company through the consolidation of smaller firms.<ref name="Frederick103" /><ref name="Punke">Punke, p. 61; Morris, p. 162-163; Chernow, p. 378-380.</ref> [[F. Augustus Heinze]], owner of Montana Ore, opposed these efforts. After losing several battles in Montana state courts, Rogers and his business associates incorporated in the state of [[New York]] and attempted to obtain control of several Montana copper mining and smelting companies.<ref name="Frederick103" /> Their goal was to establish [[Diversity jurisdiction|diversity of jurisdiction]] so that any future lawsuits would be heard by federal courts (which Rogers believed would be less considerate of Heinze's interests).<ref name="Frederick103" /> Heinze's associates bought stock in the New York company, and then initiated a lawsuit (financed by Heinze) in which they claimed that the reincorporation had been done without shareholder consent.<ref name="Frederick103" /> Rogers lost the suit, and was forced to re-reincorporate (a process which took several years).<ref name="Frederick103" /> Rogers purchased Anaconda Copper in 1899, then established a new holding company (the Amalgamated Copper Company) to control Anaconda and the other firms Rogers coveted.<ref name="Frederick105">Frederick, p. 105.</ref> By November 1900, Amalgamated had purchased the [[Colorado Smelter and Mining Company]] and the [[Washoe Copper Company]], and had a controlling interest in the stock of the [[Parrott Silver and Copper Mining Company]].<ref name="Frederick105" /> The following year, Rogers obtained a majority stockholder position in the Boston and Montana and the Butte and Montana companies.<ref name="Frederick105" />

==Post-consolidation==
In 1903, the Amalgamated shut down its smelting operations in an attempt to force Heinze to shut down his mines.  This would turn Heinze's miners, who idolized their young chief executive officer, against him.<ref name="Frederick105" /> Unfortunately, Heinze kept his mining operations open. In 1904, he disobeyed a federal injunction and began mining an underground area whose ownership was in dispute.<ref name="Frederick105" /> Heinze was fined $20,000, and held in contempt of court.<ref name="Frederick106" /> [[John D. Ryan (mining)|John D. Ryan]], president of the [[Marcus Daly|Daly Bank and Trust Co.]] in Butte and former president of the Anaconda Company,<ref>Morris, p. 227; "John D. Ryan Dies Unexpectedly." ''New York Times.'' February 12, 1933.</ref> convinced Heinze to sell out to Amalgamated.<ref name="Frederick106" /> Heinze did so in 1906, accepting $10.5 million in compensation and agreeing to end more than 110 lawsuits which had tied up $70 to $100 million worth of Amalgamated property.<ref name="Frederick106" /><ref name="Whitten127" />

On April 7, 1908, construction began on the "Big Stack," a chimney for dispersal of fumes {{convert|506|ft|m}} high, with an interior measurement of {{convert|78.5|ft|m}} in diameter at the base and {{convert|50|ft|m}} in diameter at the top.<ref name="Minesand351">[http://books.google.com/books?id=mKc5AQAAIAAJ&dq=%22Great%20Falls%20Water%20Power%22&pg=PA351#v=onepage&q=%22Great%20Falls%20Water%20Power%22&f=false "Great Falls, Montana," p. 351.]</ref> Built by the Alphonse Custodis Construction Co. of New York, it was completed on October 23, 1908,<ref name="Minesand351" /> and was the [[List of tallest chimneys in the world|tallest chimney in the world]] when finished.<ref>Marcosson, p. 289.</ref>

The former Boston and Montana smelter in Great Falls closed in 1980.<ref>Mutschler, p. 14.</ref>

In 2011, the old B&M smelter was listed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) as a [[Superfund]] hazardous and toxic waste site.<ref name="Puckett">Puckett, Karl. "EPA Adds Black Eagle Site to Superfund List." ''Great Falls Tribune.''
