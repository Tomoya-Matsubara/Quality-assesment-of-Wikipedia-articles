'''Cortana''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] (AI) character in [[Bungie Studios]]' [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' series]] of video games. Voiced by [[Jen Taylor]], she appears in ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' and its sequels, ''[[Halo 2]]'' and ''[[Halo 3]]'', as well the novels ''[[Halo: The Flood]]'', ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]'',  ''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', and ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]''. During gameplay, Cortana provides backstory and tactical information to the player, who assumes the role of the [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]]. In the story, she is instrumental in preventing the activation of the [[Halo (megastructure)|Halo]] installations, which would have destroyed all [[sentience|sentient]] life in the galaxy.<ref name=uhoh/>

Bungie first introduced Cortana<U+2014>and ''Halo''<U+2014>through the Cortana Letters, cryptic emails sent during ''Combat Evolved''{{'}}s production in 1999.<ref name="haloeffect95"/> Since then, the character has been used extensively to advertise the series. Action figures of the character were sold in conjunction with the latter two games, and she appeared in other forms of [[Marketing for Halo 3|marketing for ''Halo 3'']]. Cortana has been recognized for her [[sexual attraction|sex appeal]], believability, and character depth; she was rated as one of the ten most disturbingly sexual game characters<ref name=disturb/> by ''[[Games.net]]'' and one of the fifty greatest female video game characters ever by ''[[Tom's Games]]''.<ref name="50best" />

==Character design==
In an interview, female Bungie artist Lorraine McLees stated that game designers are generally men, and "women in their games are perhaps portrayed in the way they themselves see women. Here, the same 3-D artist who wanted to not portray women as [[sexual objectification|sex object]]s [...] coincidentally, modeled Cortana."<ref name=mclees>{{cite web|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/h/halo2/themakers.htm|author=Szabo, Brooke|accessdate=2007-10-10|date=[[2006-01-01]]|work=xbox.com|title=Bungie Art Grrl McLees}}</ref> Cortana's original Halo model was based on the Egyptian Queen [[Nefertiti]].<ref name=nefertiti>{{cite web|url=http://forums.bungie.org/halo/archive9.pl?read=241110|author=Lorraine Mclees|accessdate=2008-01-05|date=[[2003-05-20]]|work=Halo.Bungie.Org|title=Cortana's face was modeled after an Egyptian queen}}</ref>

Voice actor [[Jen Taylor]] said that she has remained somewhat distanced from the character, and has attended only one fan convention in six years after the release of ''Halo: Combat Evolved''.<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Jen Taylor|Taylor, Jen]] (narr.)|title= The Cortana Chronicles |year=2007|medium=[[Halo 3#Versions|''Halo 3'' Legendary Edition]]|publisher=[[Bungie Studios]]}}</ref> Despite her role in voicing other video game characters, including [[Princess Peach]], she is not a gamer.<ref name=ritual>{{cite web|author=Taylor, Jen; Staff|url=http://www.ritualistic.com/content.php/interviews/060503_sineps_02.php|title=SiN Episodes Voice Cast Interview|accessdate=2007-10-23|work=ritualistic.com|date=[[2006-05-03]]}}</ref> She felt that portraying Cortana was occasionally challenging because the character lacks a physical form and is "a computer".<ref name=ritual/> Interviewed about Cortana in ''Halo 3'', Taylor said that "There<U+2019>s a lot more drama and a lot less technical [[jargon]] this time around. I actually just finished a couple of lines that nearly had me in tears."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&link=9533|title=Bungie Weekly Update|date=[[2007-02-16]]|accessdate=2007-10-16|work=bungie.net|author=K., Paul}}</ref> When choosing a voice actor for the character, Bungie originally wanted Cortana to have a [[British accent]]. Although this idea was later discarded, Cortana still uses British colloquialisms in ''Halo: Combat Evolved''.<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Jason Jones (programmer)|Jones, Jason]]; [[Marty O'Donnell|O'Donnell, Marty]]; and [[Joseph Staten|Staten, Joseph]] |date2=2007-09-25 |title=Halo: Combat Evolved Developer's Commentary |medium=[[Halo 3#Versions|''Halo 3'' Legendary Edition]] | time=37:00| publisher=[[Bungie Studios]]}}<U+2014>'''Staten:''' "Because originally you wanted Cortana to have a British accent." / '''Jones:''' "What?" / '''O'Donnell:''' "That's actually true because when we cast Cortana we asked every woman to do an English accent for us."</ref>

==Attributes==
===Personality===
Cortana is constructed from the [[cloning|cloned]] brain of [[List of Halo characters#Catherine Halsey|Dr. Catherine Elizabeth Halsey]], the creator of the [[SPARTAN Project]]; Halsey's synaptic networks became the basis for Cortana's processors.<ref name=for218/> According to the ''Halo'' novels, Cortana is classified as "smart", meaning that her creative matrix is allowed to expand, in contrast to the limited matrix of other "dumb" [[List of Halo characters#AIs|AI characters in the story]]. This allows Cortana to learn and adapt beyond her basic parameters, but at the cost of a limited "lifespan" of only seven years; eventually, she will literally "think herself to death".<ref name=for218/>

Cortana is highly skilled and capable of hacking alien computer systems and decoding transmissions,<ref>{{cite book | year=2001 | editor=[[Bungie Studios]] | title=''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' Instruction Manual | pages=9 | publisher=Microsoft Game Studios|language=}}</ref> and is occasionally smug about her abilities.<ref name=for218/> In ''Halo: The Fall of Reach'' she [[hacker|hacks]] into Top Secret [[United Nations Space Command#Office of Naval Intelligence|Office of Naval Intelligence]] (ONI) documents out of boredom.<ref name=for216/> Her intellect occasionally causes her to be loquacious to a fault; In ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach|The Fall of Reach]]'', Halsey notes that if she were to let Cortana continue with her hypothesis, the AI would talk all day.<ref name=for217/> The Doctor also sees Cortana as a teenage version of herself: smarter than her parents, always "talking, learning, and eager to share her knowledge."<ref name=for218>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]|year= 2001|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45132-5 |pages=218}}</ref> Cortana is also described as having a [[wikt:sardonic|sardonic]] sense of humor;<ref>{{cite web| url=http://features.teamxbox.com/xbox/899/Halo-2-Bios-Blowout/p2/| title=Halo 2: Bios Blowout| author=Staff| publisher=Team Xbox| date=2004-[[September 14|09-14]]| accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref> she often cracks jokes or comments wryly, even during combat.<ref name=for217>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]|year= 2001|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45132-5 |pages=217}}</ref> Her high spirits and lack of programming restrictions give her a set of behavioral "quirks" unique among most AI characters in the ''Halo'' universe.<ref name=for233/> For example, she becomes irate and impatient when the Master Chief doubts her judgment in ''Halo: First Strike''.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: First Strike]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-46781-7 |pages=67}}</ref>

===Outward appearance===
As an artificial construct, Cortana has no physical form or being. However, she always speaks with a smooth female voice,<ref name=for233>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]|year= 2001|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45132-5 |pages=233}}</ref> and appears holographically as a woman. In ''Halo: The Fall of Reach'', Cortana is described as slender, with close-cropped hair and a skin hue that varies from navy blue to lavender, depending on  her mood.<ref name=for216>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]|year= 2001|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45132-5 |pages=216}}</ref> Her appearance in ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' is similar, while in ''Halo 2'' and ''Halo 3'' she becomes bluer in tone, and has a different hair style. Numbers and symbols flash across her form when she is thinking.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0|pages=9}}</ref>

==Appearances==
===''Halo: The Fall of Reach''===
{{see also|Halo: The Fall of Reach}}
The origin of Cortana is not explained in the video games, but in the ''Halo'' novels. Her first chronological appearance in the story is in ''Halo: The Fall of Reach'', a 2001 [[prequel]] to the first video game. Dr. Halsey allows Cortana to choose which [[SPARTAN-II]] soldier to accompany on an upcoming mission; Cortana picks the [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]], whom she believes is her best match.<ref name=for220/> Cortana and the Spartans are assigned a near-suicidal mission: to take the cruiser ''[[United Nations Space Command#Pillar of Autumn|Pillar of Autumn]]'' to the home world of the [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]], an alliance of alien races, and capture one of their [[Covenant (Halo)#Prophet|Prophets]] to force a truce.<ref>{{cite book | year=2001 | editor=[[Bungie Studios]] | title=''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' Instruction Manual | pages=6-7 | publisher=Microsoft Game Studios|language=}}</ref> Before the mission, Cortana helps the Master Chief to survive the near-lethal exercises designed to test the Chief's [[MJOLNIR battle armor]]. Afterward, she plants incriminating evidence in the files of [[List of Halo characters#James Ackerson|Colonel Ackerson]], the ONI operative who nearly killed both of them, as revenge.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]|year= 2001|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45132-5 |pages=247}}</ref> When the [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]] attacks the planet [[Halo universe#Reach|Reach]], the largest human habitation besides Earth, Cortana guides the ''Pillar of Autumn'' based on star charts on a [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunner]] tablet, thus bringing them to [[Halo (megastructure)#Installation 04|Halo]].

[[Image:Cortana.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Cortana in her original form in ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'']]
Cortana first appears in the video games during the introductory [[cinematic]] of ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. In the 2003 novelization of the game, ''[[Halo: The Flood]]'', Cortana likewise plays an important role. Controlling the ''[[United Nations Space Command#Pillar of Autumn|Pillar of Autumn]]''{{'}}s defenses, Cortana destroys three Covenant targets before the ship's weapons are disabled. Under the [[United Nations Space Command#Cole Protocol|Cole Protocol]], Captain Keyes, the ''Autumn''{{'}}s commanding officer, prepares to abandon ship. Since the protocol mandates the evacuation of any AI constructs, the Master Chief is charged with safeguarding Cortana from the Covenant.<ref>'''Keyes:''' Protocol is clear. Destruction or capture of the shipboard AI is absolutely unacceptable, and that means you are leaving the ship. ... Which is where you come in, Chief. Get Cortana off this ship; keep her safe from the enemy. - {{cite video game |title=[[Halo: Combat Evolved]] |developer=Bungie Studios |publisher=Microsoft |date=2001 |platform=Xbox |version= |level=Pillar of Autumn |language= |quote=}}</ref> When the Master Chief arrives on [[Halo (megastructure)#Installation 04|Halo]], Cortana helms the communications channels and helps to direct [[List of Halo characters#Carol "Foehammer" Rawley|Foehammer]], a dropship pilot, to human survivors scattered across the ring, and assists the Master Chief in the rescue of Captain Keyes from the Covenant ship ''[[Covenant (Halo)#Truth and Reconciliation|Truth and Reconciliation]]''.

Inserted into Halo's Control Room, Cortana looks for a way to activate Halo to use as a weapon against the Covenant, but becomes visibly agitated and sends the Master Chief to find Captain Keyes.<ref>'''Cortana:''' This is it. Halo's control center. [...] This ring isn't a cudgel, you barbarian. It's something else. Something much more important. The Covenant were right. This ring, it's Forerunner.

There must have been signs! / '''Master Chief:''' Slow down. You're losing me. / '''Cortana:''' The Covenant found something buried in this ring; something horrible.

The Master Chief and Guilty Spark return to the Control Room, intent on using the Index, the key to Halo, to eliminate the Flood, but Cortana reveals the truth that she has learned: Halo does not kill Flood, but their food. If Halo were activated, all sentient life in the galaxy would be destroyed.<ref name=uhoh>'''Cortana:''' Halo doesn't kill Flood<U+2014>it kills their food.

===''Halo: First Strike''===
{{see also|Halo: First Strike}}
[[Eric Nylund]]'s 2003 novel ''[[Halo: First Strike]]'' takes place immediately after the events of ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. Cortana and the Master Chief, seemingly the sole survivors of the events of ''Halo'', discover a small number of other [[United Nations Space Command]] (UNSC) personnel have in fact escaped the ring.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: First Strike]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-46781-7 |pages=22}}</ref> Cortana helps to take control of a Covenant cruiser, ''[[Covenant (Halo)#Ascendant Justice|Ascendant Justice]]'', and later returns to Earth with the remaining survivors after destroying the Covenant space station ''Unyielding Hierophant''.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: First Strike]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-46781-7 |pages=332}}</ref> In this novel, Cortana gains the ability to create imperfect clones of her program. A clone that the Master Chief and his Spartan Blue Team bring to ''Unyielding Hierophant'' eventually re-clones itself hundreds of times to aid the Spartans in completing their mission.

===''Halo 2''===
{{see also|Halo 2}}
Cortana appears next in ''[[Halo 2]]'', on the Earth defense platform ''Cairo'', at an awards ceremony for the heroes of ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. When a Covenant fleet arrives, Cortana takes control of the ''Cairo''{{'}}s [[United Nations Space Command#Weapons|Magnetic Accelerator Cannon]] to repel the invaders,<ref>{{cite video game |title=[[Halo 2]] |developer=Bungie Studios |publisher=Microsoft |date=2004 |platform=[[Xbox]] |version= |level=Cairo Station |language= |quote='''Lord Hood''': You have the MAC gun, Cortana.

Later, upon discovering [[Halo (megastructure)#Installation 05|Delta Halo]], Cortana gives [[List of Halo characters#Miranda Keyes|Commander Miranda Keyes]] access to all information on the original Halo, and provides intelligence to the Chief and UNSC Marines on the surface of the ring. When sent by the Flood leader, [[Gravemind]], to the Covenant city of [[Covenant (Halo)#High Charity|High Charity]], Cortana stays there as the Master Chief follows the [[Hierarchs (Halo)#High Prophet of Truth|Prophet of Truth]].

===''Halo 3''===
{{see also|Halo 3}}
Cortana returns in the final installment in the ''Halo'' trilogy, the 2007 [[Xbox 360]] game ''Halo 3''. During gameplay, Cortana appears to the player in broken transmissions, often reciting lines from ''Fall of Reach'' and earlier games.<ref name=for220>{{cite book |last=Nylund |first=Eric |title=[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]] |year=2001 |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |isbn=0-345-45132-5 |pages=220 |quote='''Halsey''': Could you sacrifice him if you had to?

In her message, she states that Gravemind is unaware of the portal opened by a Forerunner artifact on Earth. Cortana continues to appear to the Chief, who later recovers her from Flood-controlled [[High Charity]]. Surprised that the Chief has against all odds rescued her (as promised), Cortana produces the Index from Installation 04, which she has kept as a souvenir.<ref>'''Cortana''': The activation index, from the first Halo ring.

While the Flood are destroyed as planned, a [[slipspace]] portal collapses as the Master Chief, the Arbiter, and Cortana attempt to escape through it, thus stranding the Chief and Cortana.

==Cultural impact==
===Promotion===
Bungie first introduced the ''Halo'' series publicly in 1999 by sending the Cortana Letters, a series of cryptic email messages, to the maintainer of marathon.bungie.org, a [[fan site]] for one of Bungie's previous series, the ''[[Marathon Trilogy]]''. The strategic use of cryptic messages in a publicity campaign was repeated in ''[[I Love Bees]]'', a promotion for ''[[Halo 2]]''.<ref name="haloeffect95">{{cite book|last=MacKay|first=Jill|chapter=The Modern Mythos|title=Halo Effect: An Unauthorized Look at the Most Successful Video Game of All Time|editor=Yeffeth, Glenn (ed.)|publisher=[[BenBella Books]]|location=[[Dallas, Texas]]|year=2006|pages=95}}</ref> Although Bungie does not consider most of the letters to be [[canon (fiction)|canon]], Cortana speaks many of the same lines in ''Halo 3''.<ref>{{cite web|date=August 2006|url=http://halostory.bungie.org/staten083106.html|title=Joe Staten Interview|work=Halo Story Page|accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref><ref name="cortana letters">{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/player/usermovies/20409.html|title=Halo 3: Beyond the Trailer|work=[[Gametrailers]]|author=Staff|accessdate=2007-11-20|date=[[2006-11-06]]}}</ref> According to C.

Cortana has been turned into an action figure twice to promote ''Halo''.

This was accomplished by making the figure look a little buxom, despite McLees' direct request to reduce the mass of the figure. She explains that the sculptor appeared reluctant to make the change and that time constraints ultimately left the design intact.<ref name=mclees/>

===Critical reception===
Although reviewers felt that Cortana essentially functioned as a "cheerleader" in the first two games,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gameroom.mlgpro.com/view/zyiJ5z9YWvg.html|title=Sci vs. Fi - ''Halo 3'' Documentary|publisher=[[Major League Gaming]]|work=mlgpro.com|accessdate=2007-10-05|author=Various|date=[[2007-10-02]]}}</ref> the character's role greatly expanded in ''Halo 3''.

Part of Cortana's appeal has lain in her looks; the character was ninth on a list of "Top Ten [[Xbox]] Babes",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://features.teamxbox.com/xbox/828/Top-Ten-Xbox-Babes/p1|title=Top Ten Xbox Babes|author=Staff|date=[[2004-06-30]]|work=teamxbox.com|accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref>''Gamedaily''{{'}}s "Babe of the Week",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/babe-of-the-week-cortana/35/|title=Babe of the Week: Cortana|work=gamedaily.com|date=[[2007-09-22]]|author=Staff| accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref> and the sixth most "disturbingly sexual game character" by Games.net.<ref name=disturb>{{cite web|url=http://www.games.net/article/netten/1/116901/top-ten-disturbingly-sexual-game-characters/|title=Top Ten Disturbingly Sexual Game Characters|author=Karl, Ben; Rudden, Dave|date=[[2007-10-05]]|accessdate=2007-10-12|work=games.net}}</ref> Aside from appearance, reviewers found other aspects to praise; Cortana was named the fifth best supporting character,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://my.mmoabc.com/article/Nik88/1679.html?login=no/|title=Top Five Best Supporting Characters|accessdate=2007-10-12|work=mmoabc.com|author=SilverMirror|date=[[2007-08-28]]|author=Aberle, Nick}}</ref> and one of the "50 Greatest Female Characters"<ref name="50best">{{cite web|url=http://www.tomsgames.com/us/2007/02/20/the_50_greatest_female_characters_in_the_history_of_video_games/|title=The 50 Greatest Female Characters in Video Game History|author=Wright, Rob|date=[[2007-02-20]]|work=tomsgames.com|accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref> in a video game; the reviewer thought that the character's determination and fearlessness meshed perfectly with the game's protagonist.<ref name="50best"/>

In an essay on references to mythology in ''Halo'' and previous Bungie games, Jill MacKay analyzed the significance of Cortana's name. It is a variant of [[Curtana]], the sword used by the legendary [[Ogier the Dane]], just as the titular AI character of ''[[Marathon 2: Durandal]]'' is apparently named after another legendary sword, [[Durendal]]. Curtana's inscription reveals that the sword has the same "temper as [[Joyeuse]] and Durendal". Accordingly, MacKay speculated before the release of ''Halo 3'' whether the "smart" Cortana would follow ''Marathon''{{'}}s Durandal in succumbing to [[rampancy]], a concept invented by Bungie in which an AI character becomes insane by gaining too much knowledge.<ref name="haloeffect9293">{{cite book|last=MacKay|first=Jill|chapter=The Modern Mythos|title=Halo Effect: An Unauthorized Look at the Most Successful Video Game of All Time|editor=Yeffeth, Glenn (ed.)|publisher=[[BenBella Books]]|location=[[Dallas, Texas]]|year=2006|pages=92<U+2013>93}}</ref>
