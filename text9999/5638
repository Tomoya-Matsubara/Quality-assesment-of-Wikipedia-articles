'''AccelerEyes''' builds programming tools for parallel programming and visual computing on [[GPU]] chipsets.  Based in [[Atlanta]], the company released [[Jacket (software)|Jacket]]<ref name=patentapp>{{Cite patent|US|2009141034|application}}</ref>, a tool to compile [[MATLAB]] code for [[CUDA]]-enabled GPUs, in June 2008.  In an October 2008 article,<ref name=tjs>{{cite web | url=http://techjournalsouth.com/news/article.html?item_id=6304 | title = AccelerEyes GPU toolbox brings supercomputer power to PCs | publisher = Tech Journal South | date = 2008-10-20 | accessdate = October 27, 2008 }}</ref> the number of current Jacket users is said to be in the thousands, and includes engineers and scientists in technology companies such as [[GE]], [[Google]], [[Toyota]], and [[Morgan Stanley]].

== Company history ==

AccelerEyes was founded in June 2007 and is notable for making simple tools for complicated graphics processing unit (GPU) programming.<ref name="tjs"/>  AccelerEyes currently has several products enabling MATLAB code to run on the GPU:  Jacket, multi-GPU tools, linear algebra libraries, an SDK, and the a compatibility package for the MATLAB Compiler.  Jacket is the GPU Toolbox for MATLAB.<ref name=mathworks>{{cite web | url=http://www.mathworks.com/products/connections/product_main.html?prod_id=825&prod_name=Jacket | title = Jacket - GPU computational backend for MATLAB | publisher = MathWorks | date = 2008-09-02 | accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref>

AccelerEyes' product, [[Jacket (software)|Jacket]], builds high-level interfaces to remove the lower-level complexity of GPU programming.<ref name=sc08>{{cite web | url= http://scyourway.nacse.org/conference/view/post124 | title = Jacket: The GPU Engine for MATLAB | publisher = Supercomputing Conference 2008 (SC08), the International Conference for High-Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis | date = 2008-10-01 | accessdate = October 27, 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  This is accomplished by enabling [[MATLAB]] code to
run on [[NVIDIA]] GPUs coprocessors.  Jacket contains a [[Run-time system|runtime]] to automatically transform MATLAB's M-code for [[CUDA]]-enabled cards.

To provide support for visual computing, Jacket's Graphics Library enables seamless integration of [[CUDA]] computation with [[OpenGL]] visualization.

The company's name, AccelerEyes, combines the prefix ''Acceler''<U+2014>used to denote speed<U+2014>and the root of ''Eyes''<U+2014>used to denote visualizations. The company-name appears with capital ''A'' and ''E''.  The company's slogan is "Delivering a Software Platform Connecting Apps to GPUs".
