'''HMAS ''Westralia''''' was an [[auxiliary cruiser]] of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN). 

==Construction and acquisition==
''Westralia'' was built at the [[Harland and Wolff]] shipyard in [[Glasgow]] for the [[Huddart Parker]] company as a twin screw motor vessel, being completed in 1929. ''Westralia'' was requisitioned for war service by the Australian government in 1939 as an [[armed merchant cruiser]] (AMC). She was fitted with {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} guns, and {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} anti-aircraft guns, before commissioning into the RAN in January 1940.

==Operational history==
''Westralia''<U+2019>s time as an AMC was spent escorting convoys in the Pacific and Indian oceans, primarily from Australia and New Zealand.

During May 1942, ''Westralia'' was present in Sydney Harbour during the [[attack on Sydney Harbour|Japanese midget submarine attack]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=David |title=Battle Surface! Japan's Submarine War Against Australia 1942<U+2013>44 |year=1992 |publisher=Random House Australia |location=Milsons Point |isbn=0-09-182638-1 |pages=193<U+2013>194 |chapter=}}</ref>

In 1943, ''Westralia'' was converted into a [[Landing Ship, Infantry]] (LSI). In this role, ''Westralia'' was used primarily to transport units of the United States Army and Marine Corps. The ship took part in landings at [[Cape Cretin]], [[Leyte Gulf]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Borneo]].

After the end of the war, ''Westralia'' was used for the repatriation of Australian troops, before being paid off in September 1946. However, as she was being refitted for a return to civilian service, ''Westralia'' was taken up again for use as a troop transport between Sydney and [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] for the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]]. However, she was not commissioned into the RAN in this role, instead having a merchant navy crew.

She ended her time with the BCOF in April 1949, and was then chartered as a troop carrier by the British [[Department of Transport|Ministry of Transport]], and served in the [[Mediterranean]] until March 1950. ''Westralia'' was finally returned to her owners in March 1951. ''Westralia'' was sold to the Asian and Pacific Shipping Co Ltd in 1959, serving as a livestock carrier, until she was eventually sold for scrap in 1961.
