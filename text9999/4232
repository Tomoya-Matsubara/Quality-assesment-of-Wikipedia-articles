The '''Goodyear F2G "Super" Corsair''' was a development by the [[Goodyear Aircraft Company]] of the FG-1/[[F4U Corsair|F4U-1]] Corsair design as a special low-altitude version of a fighter equipped with a [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360]] twenty-eight cylinder, four row radial air-cooled engine. Although often cited that the origin of the aircraft was as an interceptor of low-flying Japanese suicide airplanes, its actual beginnings came about in 1939 when the Pratt and Whitney company first proposed its enormous new engine. The F2G lineage was tied to its engine design rather than tactical requirements. <ref> Pautigny 2003, p.76.</ref>

==Design and development==
Using experience from building the fixed-wing FG-1, a version of the folding wing F4U-1 Corsair, in early [[1944]], Goodyear extensively modified a standard FG-1 airframe, designated the '''XF2G-1''', to take advantage of the 50% increase in take-off power provided by the R-4360 engine. In addition, an all-round vision bubble-type canopy was installed. In March 1944, Goodyear was awarded a contract to deliver 418 '''F2G-1''' and 10 '''F2G-2''' aircraft. The F2G-2 version included modifications for carrier operations. 

Armament provisions included alternative wing-mounted installations for four or six 0.5 inch (12.7 mm) machine guns and eight 5 inch (127 mm) rockets or two 1,000 or 1,600 lb (450 or 725 kg) bombs. The internal fuel capacity was increased greatly over that of the FG-1, and provisions were provided to carry two droppable external tanks.

By the end of the war in August [[1945 in aviation|1945]], only five each of the F2G-1 and F2G-2 aircraft were completed. Testing, also, revealed deficiencies in lateral control and insufficient speed that were bars to further development of the aircraft and, thus, further production of the fighters was canceled.

==Racing==
Only three of the "Super Corsairs" are still in existence. F2G-1 BuNo 88454 is currently on display in standard Navy markings at the Champlin Fighter Museum. The fifth F2G-1, BuNo 88458, was purchased by Cook Cleland, who went on to finish third in the 1949 Thompson Trophy Race and first in the 1949 Tinnerman Trophy Race. Over time, the plane, registered as NX5588N, went from owner to owner and slowly deteriorated. Finally in 1996, NX5588N was purchased by Bob Odegaard of [[North Dakota]], and was returned to airworthy condition in 1999. Odegaard is currently  restoring F2G-2 BuNo 88463, also of air racing fame, for a static display.
