'''Fort Charles''' was built between 1650 and 1560, the first fort constructed in [[Port Royal]], [[Jamaica]].<ref name=JNHT>{{cite web|title=Fort Charles|url=http://www.jnht.com/site_fort_charles.php|publisher=Jamaica National Heritage Trust|accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>

==History==
The fort was originally called '''Fort Cromwell''' but subsequently renamed.<ref name=JNHT /> 

In 1667 it had 36 guns while in 1765 it had 104 guns and a garrison of 500 men.<ref name=JNHT /> 

It was damaged by both the [[1692 Jamaica earthquake]] and the [[1907 Kingston earthquake]] which later resulted in the tilting of the [[Giddy House]], now a minor tourist attraction.
