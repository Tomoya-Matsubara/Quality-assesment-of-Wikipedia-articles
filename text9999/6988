[[image:R40.jpg|thumb|270px|R40M running on the [[BMT Jamaica Line]] at the [[Myrtle Avenue]] Station]]The '''R40A''' is a [[New York City Subway]] car order built by [[St. Louis Car Company]] in 1968&ndash;69. The order contains two forms, a slant version similar to the [[R40 (New York City Subway car)|R40]], and a "Modified" version similar to the [[R42 (New York City Subway car)|R42]]. 

The R40A is similar to the R40, but R40A has built in [[air conditioning]] units. In addition, centerline poles are arranged in diagonal patterns rather than the straight lines of the R42. The R40A slant version was the last 100 cars to be built with the end slant, with R40A Slant unit numbers 4350-4449.

With the poorly conceived slant design having proven unsuccessful, the [[New York City Transit Authority]] (NYCTA) had the last 100 R40 cars (unofficially known as the '''R40M''' series) built with a non-slant end. The end was redesigned by Sundberg-Ferar, and is identical to the non-slanted end on the [[R42 (New York City Subway car)|R42]]. The R40M is called a modified or a straight R40 and is part of the R40A car order, from car 101 to 200 of the order, with R40M unit numbers ''4450-4549''. These cars can be found on the same lines as the R40s.

In 1988<U+2013>89 the R40's were rebuilt by Sumitomo in Elmira Heights, New York.

The base order of [[R160]] cars will replace the slant R40 cars. If the R160 option orders are taken, the R160 will also replace all R40M cars.
