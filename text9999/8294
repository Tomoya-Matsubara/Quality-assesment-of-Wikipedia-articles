'''''Babakotia''''' is a medium-sized, extinct [[genus]] of [[lemur]], or [[strepsirrhine]] [[primate]], from [[Madagascar]] that contains a single species, '''''Babakotia radofilai'''''. Together with ''[[Palaeopropithecus]]'', ''[[Archaeoindris]]'', and ''[[Mesopropithecus]]'', it forms the family Palaeopropithecidae, commonly known as the [[sloth lemur]]s. The name ''Babakotia'' comes from the [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] name for the [[Indri]], ''babakoto'', to which it and all other sloth lemurs are closely related. Due to its mix of [[Morphology (biology)|morphological trait]]s that show intermediate stages between the living [[Indriidae|indriid]]s and the large sloth lemurs, it has helped determine the relationship between both groups and the closely related and extinct [[monkey lemur]]s.

''Babakotia radofilai'' and all other sloth lemurs share many traits with living [[sloth]]s, demonstrating [[convergent evolution]]. It had long forearms, curved digits, and highly mobile hip and ankle joints. Its skull was more heavily built than that of indriids, but not as much as in the larger sloth lemurs. Its [[dentition]] is similar to that of all other indriids and sloth lemurs. It lived in the northern part of Madagascar and shared its range with at least two other sloth lemur species, ''Palaeopropithecus ingens'' and ''Mesopropithecus dolichobrachion''. ''Babakotia radofilai'' was primarily a leaf-eater ([[folivore]]), though it also ate fruit and hard seeds. It is known only from [[subfossil]] remains and may have died out prior to the arrival of humans on the island, but not enough [[radiocarbon dating]] has been done with this species to know for certain.

==Etymology==
The name of the genus ''Babakotia'' derives from the [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] common name for the [[Indri]], ''babakoto'', a close relative of ''Babakotia''. The [[Species|species name]], ''radofilai'', was chosen in honor of French mathematician and [[expatriate]] Jean Radofilao, an avid [[Caving|spelunker]] who mapped the caves where remains of ''Babakotia radofilai'' were first found.{{r|1990Godfrey}}

==Classification and phylogeny==
''Babakotia radofilai'' is the sole member of the [[genus]] ''Babakotia'' and belongs to the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Palaeopropithecidae]], which includes three other genera of [[sloth lemur]]s: ''[[Palaeopropithecus]]'', ''[[Archaeoindris]]'', and ''[[Mesopropithecus]]''. This family in turn belongs to the [[Taxonomic rank|infraorder]] [[Lemuriformes]], which includes all the Malagasy lemurs.{{r|Mittermeier_2ndEd|Nowak}}

The first subfossil remains of ''Babakotia radofilai'' were discovered as part of a series of expeditions launched in the early 1980s by [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] [[Elwyn Simons]].{{r|2003Godfrey}}  They were unearthed in 1988 at a cave known as [[Antsiroandoha]] in the [[Ankarana Reserve|Ankarana Massif]], northern Madagascar.  A nearly complete skeleton and skull were found, in addition to the remains of roughly a dozen other individuals.{{r|2002Godfrey}}  Identified immediately as a sloth lemur (palaeopropithecid) upon its discovery,{{r|1990Godfrey}} ''Babakotia'' along with ''Mesopropithecus'' helped to settle a debate about the relationship between the sloth lemurs, the [[monkey lemur]]s (family Archaeolemuridae) and the living [[Indriidae|indriid]]s. The monkey lemurs had skulls that more closely resembled the indriids, but their teeth were very specialized and unlike those of the indriids. The larger sloth lemurs, on the other hand, retained a [[dentition]] similar to living indriids, yet differed by having more robust and specialized skulls. ''Babakotia'' and ''Mesopropithecus'' not only shared the indriid dentition, but also the indriid-like skulls, providing evidence that sloth lemurs were most closely related to living indriids, with monkey lemurs as a [[Cladistics|sister group]] to both.{{r|Mittermeier_1stEd}} Furthermore, the discovery of ''Babakotia'' helped to demonstrate that the ancestral indriids were not "ricochetal leapers" (bouncing rapidly from tree to tree) like living indriids, but vertical climbers and hanging feeders, and possibly occasional leapers.{{r|1991Jungers}}

Weighing between {{convert|16|and|20|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, ''Babakotia radofilai'' was a medium-sized lemur and noticeably smaller than the large sloth lemurs (''Archaeoindris'' and ''Palaeopropithecus''), but larger than the small sloth lemurs (''Mesopropithecus'').{{r|Mittermeier_2ndEd|Nowak}} In many ways, it had an intermediate level of adaptations for [[suspensory behavior]] between the large sloth lemurs and the small sloth lemurs.{{r|Nowak|2002Godfrey|NatHist-13h|Mittermeier_1stEd|NaturalChange6}}  This includes its highly mobile hip and ankle joints, as well as other specializations in the vertebral column, pelvis, and limbs.{{r|NaturalChange6}}  Its [[forelimb]]s were 20% longer than its [[hind limb]]s, giving it a higher [[intermembral index]] (~119) than ''Mesopropithecus'' (~97 to 113), suggesting that it was [[convergent evolution|convergently]] similar to [[Arboreal locomotion|arboreal]] [[sloth]]s.{{r|NaturalChange6|NaturalChange8}}  It had a reduced [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] and curved, elongated digits, adapted for grasping and suggesting suspensory behavior.{{r|NaturalChange6|1997Jungers}}  Its hind feet were reduced, making it well-adapted for climbing and hanging (like in other palaeopropithecids), but not leaping (like in indriids).{{r|Mittermeier_2ndEd|Nowak|2002Godfrey}} Wrist bones found in 1999 further demonstrated that this species was a vertical climber.{{r|2000Hamrick}}  Additionally, analysis of its [[semicircular canal]]s,{{r|2008Walker}} [[lumbar vertebrae]] and its spinous processes indicate slow movement and climbing (antipronograde) adaptations, but not necessarily sloth-like hanging, vertical clinging, or leaping.{{r|2005Shapiro}}  Therefore, it was likely a slow climber like a [[loris]] and also exhibited some suspensory behavior like a sloth.{{r|2003Godfrey}}

All sloth lemurs have relatively robust skulls compared to the indriids,{{r|Nowak}} yet despite shared [[cranium|cranial]] features with the larger sloth lemurs,{{r|Mittermeier_1stEd}} its skull still resembles that of an Indri.{{r|Mittermeier_2ndEd}} The cranial traits shared with the other sloth lemurs include relatively small [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit]]s, robust [[zygomatic arch]]es, and a mostly rectangular [[hard palate]].{{r|Nowak}} The small orbits taken into consideration with the relative size of the [[optic canal]] suggests that ''Babakotia'' had low [[visual acuity]], which is typical for lemurs.{{r|Lemurs3}} The skull length averages {{convert|144|mm|in|abbr=on}}.{{r|2002Godfrey}}

The [[Dentition|dental formula]] of ''Babakotia radofilai'' was the same as the other indriids and sloth lemurs: either {{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.2.3|lower=1.1.2.3}}{{r|Nowak|Mittermeier_1stEd}} or {{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.2.3|lower=2.0.2.3|total=30}}.{{r|2002Godfrey}} It is unclear whether one of the teeth in the [[Permanent teeth|permanent dentition]] is an [[incisor]] or [[canine tooth|canine]], resulting in these two conflicting dental formulae.{{r|PrimateAnatomy7}}  Regardless, the lack of either a lower canine or incisor results in a four-tooth [[toothcomb]] instead of the more typical six-tooth strepsirrhine toothcomb.  ''Babakotia radofilai'' differed slightly from indriids in having somewhat elongated [[premolar]]s.  Its cheek teeth had broad shearing crests and crenulated [[Tooth enamel|enamel]].{{r|2002Godfrey}}
<br clear="all" />

==Distribution and ecology==
Like all other lemurs, ''Babakotia radofilai'' was [[Endemism|endemic]] to Madagascar. Its remains have only been found in [[Cave#Solutional cave|limestone cave]]s at the Ankarana Massif and [[Anjohibe]], indicating a range across the extreme north and northwest of the island.{{r|Nowak|2002Godfrey|Sussman4}}  The restricted range of this arboreal primate, particularly during a time when much of the island was blanketed in forest, might have been due to habitat specificity, [[Competitive exclusion principle|competitive exclusion]], or some other unknown factor.{{r|1997Burney}}  It was [[sympatric]] (occurred together) with ''Palaeopropithecus ingens'' and ''Mesopropithecus dolichobrachion''.{{r|NaturalChange8}}

Based on its size, the morphology of its [[Molar tooth|molar]]s, and microwear analysis on its teeth, ''Babakotia radofilai'' was likely a [[folivore]], while supplementing its diet with fruit and hard [[Seed predation|seeds]].{{r|Mittermeier_2ndEd|NatHist-13h|Lemurs3|2002Rafferty}} In all sloth lemurs, including ''Babakotia radofilai'', the [[permanent tooth|permanent teeth]] erupted early, a trait seen in indriids that improves survivability of juveniles during the first dry season following [[weaning]].{{r|NaturalChange6}}

==Extinction==
Because it died out relatively recently and is only known from subfossil remains, it is considered to be a modern form of Malagasy lemur.{{r|Sussman4}} ''Babakotia radofilai'' lived during the [[Holocene]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] and is thought to have disappeared shortly after the arrival of humans to the island, possibly within the last 1000 years.{{r|Nowak}} However, the only [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon date]] that has been reported for it dates back to about 3100&ndash;2800&nbsp;BCE.{{r|1995Simons}}
