'''Jennifer Frost''' (born [[February 22]], [[1978]], [[Liverpool]]), is an [[England|English]] [[singer]], [[model (person)|model]], and member of [[Atomic Kitten]].

==Biography==
Jenny loved music from an early age. Her earliest concert experience was when her dad took her to a [[Level 42]] concert at the age of nine <ref>[http://www.askmen.com/women/singer_200/246c_jenny_frost.html AskMen: Jenny Frost] <small>(Accessed Aug 1, 2006)</small></ref>. Sports and dancing were Jenny's favourite activities, however modelling was her dream. After high school she started to work for the [[BBC]] doing the Holiday Programme and travelling around the world. 

Jenny started her musical career in 1998 in the girl-band [[Precious (band)|Precious]], which became famous by winning the right to represent the UK at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in [[1999]], with the song "Say It Again". In a strange reversal of what has frequently happened to British entries, this success propelled Jenny and the band to a big hit in the UK charts, while they flopped at the contest itself, finishing only twelfth. Subsequent releases by Precious enjoyed only modest success and Jenny moved on by replacing [[Kerry Katona]] in [[Atomic Kitten]] in [[2001]], just in time to bask in the reflected glory of the band's first UK No 1 single, "[[Whole Again]]".

Jenny Frost got engaged with DJ [[Dom Thrupp]] in 2002, however the couple has no intention of getting married yet. <ref>''Sunday Magazine'', December 4, 2005, page 25</ref> After the split of [[Atomic Kitten]], Jenny has embarked on a solo career and released her first single ''Crash Landing'' on [[October 10]], [[2005]], which failed to reach the Top 40. Jenny originally recorded the song for the band [[Route 1 (band)|Route 1]], but decided to remake it and shoot a video for the song which features Jenny in a spaceship in a pink/purple setting.

She has recently appeared on the [[2005]] edition of ''[[I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!]]'' on the [[ITV]] network. Jenny is also part of [[Premier Model Management]] and does various modelling assignments like being the face of an underwear range. <ref>[http://www.jennyfrostofficial.com/biog3.html Jenny Frost's official biography] <small>(Accessed Aug 1, 2006)</small></ref><ref>[http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/fashion/9552004.htm FemaleFirst.co.uk Jenny Frosts Kotex advertising Campaign] <small>(Accessed Aug 24, 2006)</small></ref>

Jenny's new single "Bad Girl" is scheduled for September 2006 and is available from her official myspace for friends only. The song was originally written for [[Jennifer Lopez]]' ''[[Enough]]'' movie and was written by Frost's boyfriend Dom Thrupp. <ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278435/soundtrack imdb.com] Soundtrack for ''Enough'' <small>(Accessed Sept 4, 2006)</small></ref>
