A '''potential superpower''' is a state or a political and economic entity that is speculated to be, or is in the process of becoming, a [[superpower]] at some point during the 21st century. Presently, only the [[United States]] fulfills the criteria to be considered a superpower.<ref>{{cite book|title=From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations since 1776|first=George|last=C.

A number of observers have also considered [[Brazil]] and [[Russia]] to be potential superpowers.

==Past predictions==
Predictions made in the past have not been perfect. For example, in the 1980s, many political and economic analysts predicted that [[Japan]] would eventually accede to superpower status, due to its large population, huge [[gross domestic product]] and high [[economic growth]] at that time.<ref name="Zakaria, F 2008">{{cite book|last=Zakaria|first=Fareed|title=The Post-American World|publisher=W.

The term "[[Second Superpower]]" has also been applied by scholars to the possibility that the [[China|People's Republic of China]] could [[China as an emerging superpower|emerge]] as a "second superpower," with [[Power (international relations)|global power]] and influence on par with the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite book|title=History of International Broadcasting|first=James|last=Wood|page=155|publisher=IET|year=2000}}</ref> The potential for the two countries to form stronger relations to address global issues is sometimes referred to as the [[Group of Two]].

[[Barry Buzan]] asserted in 2004 that "China certainly presents the most promising all-round profile" of a potential superpower.<ref name="The United States and the Great Powers">{{cite book | last =Buzan | first =Barry | coauthors = | title=The United States and the Great Powers | publisher=Polity Press | year=2004 | location=Cambridge, United Kingdom | page =70 | isbn =0-7456-3375-7 | url=}}</ref> Buzan claimed that "China is currently the most fashionable potential superpower and the one whose degree of alienation from the dominant international society makes it the most obvious political challenger." However, he noted this challenge is constrained by the major challenges of development and by the fact that its rise could trigger a counter coalition of states in [[Asia]].

[[Parag Khanna]] stated in 2008 that by making massive trade and investment deals with Latin America and Africa, China had established its presence as a superpower along with the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]]. China's rise is demonstrated by its ballooning share of trade in its [[gross domestic product]]. He believed that China's "consultative style" had allowed it to develop political and economic ties with many countries including those viewed as rogue states by the United States. He stated that the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] founded with Russia and the Central Asian countries may eventually be the "NATO of the East".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/magazine/27world-t.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|last=Khanna|first=Parag|title=Waving Goodbye to Hegemony|accessdate=July 19, 2014}}</ref>

Economist and author of ''Eclipse: Living in the Shadow of China's Economic Dominance'' Arvind Subramanian argued in 2012 that China will direct the world's financial system by 2020 and that the Chinese [[renminbi]] will replace the [[dollar]] as the world's [[reserve currency]] in 10 to 15 years. The United States' [[soft power]] will remain longer. He stated that "China was a top dog economically for thousands of years prior to the [[Ming Dynasty]]. In some ways, the past few hundred years have been an aberration."<ref>{{cite web|author=By&nbsp;Ted Greenwald&nbsp;&nbsp; |url=http://www.wired.com/magazine/2012/02/st_subramanianqa/ |title=Taming the Dragon: One Scholar's Plan to Soften Chinese Dominance &#124; Magazine |publisher=WIRED |date=February 28, 2012|accessdate=June 28, 2014}}</ref>

Lawrence Saez at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, argued in 2011 that the United States will be surpassed by China as military superpower within twenty years. Regarding economic power, the Director of the China Center for Economic Reform at Peking University Yao Yang stated that "Assuming that the Chinese and U.S. economies grow, respectively, by 8% and 3% in real terms, that China's inflation rate is 3.6% and America's is 2% (the averages of the last decade), and that the renminbi appreciates against the dollar by 3% per year (the average of the last six years), China will become the world's largest economy by 2021. By that time, both countries' GDP will be about $24 trillion."<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120311061413/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-06-10/world/china.military.superpower_1_superpower-military-spending-military-dominance/2?_s=PM:WORLD|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-06-10/world/china.military.superpower_1_superpower-military-spending-military-dominance/2?_s=PM:WORLD|title=When Will China Become a Global Superpower?|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=June 10, 2011|archivedate=March 11, 2012|accessdate=June 28, 2014}}</ref>

Historian [[Timothy Garton Ash]] argued in 2011, pointing to factors such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] predicting that China's GDP ([[purchasing power parity]] adjusted) will overtake that of the United States in 2016, that a power shift to a world with several superpowers was happening "Now". However, China was still lacking in soft power and power projection abilities and had a low [[Per capita income|GDP/person]]. The article also stated that the [[Pew Research Center]] in a 2009 survey found that people in 15 out of 22 countries believed that China had or would overtake the US as the world's leading superpower.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.caixin.com/2012-02-27/100360946.html|publisher=[[Caixin]]|title=Oxford Prof on China and the New World Order Part 1|language=English, Chinese|date=February 27, 2012|accessdate=July 19, 2014}}</ref>

In an interview given in 2011, Singapore's first premier, [[Lee Kuan Yew]], stated that while China supplanting the United States is not a foregone conclusion, Chinese leaders are nonetheless serious about displacing the United States as the most powerful country in Asia. "They have transformed a poor society by an economic miracle to become now the second-largest economy in the world.

Chinese foreign policy adviser [[Wang Jisi]] in 2012 stated that many Chinese officials see China as a first-class power which should be treated as such. China is argued to soon become the world's largest economy and to be making rapid progress in many areas. The United States is seen as a declining superpower as indicated by factors such as poor economic recovery, financial disorder, high deficits gaining close to GPD levels and unemployment, increasing political polarization, and over regulation forcing jobs overseas in China.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.epi.org/publication/counting_the_jobs_lost_to_china/ |title=Counting the jobs lost to China &#124; Economic Policy Institute|work=epi.org|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/asia/east-pacific/US-China-Experts-Warn-of-Growing-Bilateral-Distrust-145900615.html|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|title=US, China Experts Warn of Growing Bilateral Distrust|date=April 2, 2012|accessdate=July 19, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2012/0330_china_lieberthal/0330_china_lieberthal.pdf|publisher=China Center at Brookings|title=Addressing U.S.-China Strategic Distrust|author=Lieberthal, Kenneth; Jisi, Wang|date=March 30, 2012|accessdate=July 19, 2014}}</ref>

Timothy Beardson, founder of Crosby International Holdings, stated in 2013, that he doesn't see "China becoming a superpower", he writes that China has basically worked as a manufacturing location for the foreign companies as 83% of all high-tech products that are made in China were produced for the foreign companies.<ref name="articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com">{{cite news| url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-06-28/news/40234296_1_challenges-facing-china-foreign-companies-china-20-years | work=The Times Of India | title=I don't see China becoming a superpower in this century|last=Beardson|first=Timothy| date=June 28, 2013}}</ref> He adds that China's problems regarding wages, aging, declining population, and also gender imbalance, (that with the 6:5 ratio of gender, 1 in 6 males will not have a female partner) suggest that such problems will lead to crimes.

[[James Fallows]] writes that too many people in China live without [[Tap water|indoor plumbing]], and that no mainland science researcher has yet won a Nobel Prize, so it is unlikely able to become an "economic Superpower".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/12/15/china-superpower-status-leadership-citizenship-trends.html | work=Forbes | first=Shaun | last=Rein | title=Yes, China Has Fully Arrived As A Superpower|date=December 15, 2009|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}</ref> He also recalled his mid 1980s visit to China, where he found virtually everyone "poor", and that "rich" people were farmers that had their own family. He further suggests that people usually talk about how life in China is improving, yet if they go to China, they would see that Chinese officials spend too much time thinking about how to deal with the upcoming problems that their country faces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2008/04/more-on-poverty-and-superpower-status/7993/|title=More on poverty and superpower status|last=Fallows|first=James|publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]''|date=April 2, 2008|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}</ref>

Geoffrey Murphay's ''China: The Next Superpower'' (2008) argued that while the potential for China is high, this is fairly perceived only by looking at the risks and obstacles China faces in managing its population and resources. The political situation in China may become too fragile to survive into superpower status according to [[Susan Shirk]] in ''China: Fragile Superpower'' (2008). Other factors that could constrain China's ability to become a superpower in the future include limited supplies of energy and raw materials, questions over its innovation capability, inequality and corruption, and risks to social stability and the environment.<ref>{{cite book|date=2008|last=Shirk|first=S.|title=China: Fragile Superpower|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-537319-6}}</ref>

[[Minxin Pei]] argued in 2010 that China is not a superpower and it will not be one anytime soon and argued that China faces daunting political and economic challenges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apac2020.the-diplomat.com/feature/china%E2%80%99s-not-a-superpower/|title=China's Not a Superpower|publisher=''The Diplomat''|date=January 20, 2010|accessdate=February 10, 2012|last=Pei|first=Minxin|authorlink=Minxin Pei}}</ref> In 2012 he argued that China, despite using economic power to influence some nations, has few real friends or allies and is surrounded by potentially hostile nations. This situation could improve if regional territorial disputes would be resolved and China would participate in an effective regional defense system that would reduce the fears of its neighbors. Alternatively, a democratization of China would dramatically improve foreign relations with many nations.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pei|first=Minxin|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/03/20/the_loneliest_superpower?page=0,0|title=The Loneliest Superpower |publisher=Foreign Policy|date=March 20, 2012|accessdate=June 28, 2014}}</ref>

[[Amy Chua]] stated in 2007 that whether a country has enough pull to bring immigrants is an important quality for a superpower. She also wrote that China lacks the pull to bring scientists, thinkers, and innovators from other countries as immigrants.

Guttman wrote in 2001 that the very definition of the term superpower has changed and in the 21st century, it does not only refer to states with military power, but also to groups such as the European Union, with strong market economics, young, highly educated workers savvy in high technology, and a global vision.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sbi7eVIcyD4C&dq=Europe+emerging+superpower&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=QxLIyJCn7Q&sig=MVdQdAbG6-3ee0A5-UjCEbNNpEE&hl=sv&ei=wBgUSuf7CJmv-AbooqioDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3#PPP1,M1 |title=Europe in the New Century: Visions of an Emerging Superpower |publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}</ref> [[Friis Arne Petersen]], the Danish ambassador to the US, has expressed similar views.

Additionally, it is argued by commentators that full political integration is not required for the European Union to wield international influence: that its apparent weaknesses constitute its real strengths (as of its low profile diplomacy and the emphasis on the rule of law)<ref name="The European Superpower"/> and that the EU represents a new and potentially more successful type of international actor than traditional ones;<ref>{{cite web|last=Hyde-Price|first=Adrian|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090326212441/http://www.arena.uio.no/cidel/WorkshopOsloSecurity/Hyde-Price.pdf|archivedate=March 26, 2009|date=October 23, 2004|url=http://www.arena.uio.no/cidel/WorkshopOsloSecurity/Hyde-Price.pdf|title=The EU, Power and Coercion: From 'Civilian' to 'Civilising' Power|publisher=ARENA Centre for European Studies|format=PDF}}</ref> however, it is uncertain if the effectiveness of such an influence would be equal to that of a more politically integrated union of states such as the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/17726 |title=Europe vs. America by Tony Judt &#124; The New York Review of Books |publisher=Nybooks.com |date= |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}</ref>

Barry Buzan notes that the EU's potential superpower status depends on its "stateness". It is unclear though how much state-like quality is needed for the EU to be described as a superpower. Buzan states that the EU is likely to remain a potential superpower for a long time because although it has material wealth, its "political weakness and its erratic and difficult course of internal political development, particularly as regards a common foreign and defence policy" constrains it from being a superpower.<ref name="The United States and the Great Powers" />

[[Alexander Stubb]], the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[Minister for Foreign Affairs]], has said that he thinks the EU is both a superpower and not a superpower. While the EU is a superpower in the sense that it is the largest [[political union]], [[single market]] and aid donor in the world, it is not a superpower in the defense or foreign policy spheres. Like Barry Buzan, Alexander Stubb thinks that the most major factor constraining the EU's rise to superpower status is its lack of statehood in the international system, other factors are its lack of internal drive to project power worldwide, and continued preference for the sovereign nation-state among some [[Europe]]ans. To counterbalance these, he urged the EU leaders to approve and ratify the [[Lisbon Treaty]] (which they did in 2009), create an EU foreign ministry ([[EEAS]], established in 2010), develop a [[Military of the European Union|common EU defense]], hold one collective seat at the [[UN Security Council]] and [[G8]], and address what he described as the "sour mood" toward the EU prevalent in some European countries today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/0717carnegie-stubb.pdf |publisher=Carnegie Endowment|title=Will the EU Ever Become a Superpower? |format=PDF |date=July 17, 2008 |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}</ref>

[[Anil K. Gupta|Anil Gupta]] is almost certain that India will become a superpower in the 21st century. As an example, he states that due to India's functional institutions of democracy and its relatively [[corruption]]-free society, it will emerge as a desirable, entrepreneurial and resource and energy-efficient superpower in the near future. He predicts that by 2015 India will overtake China to be the fastest growing economy in the world and emerge as a full-fledged economic superpower by 2025. In addition to that, he states, India has the potential to serve as a leading example of how to combine rapid economic growth with fairness towards and inclusion of those at the bottom rungs of the ladder and of efficient resource utilization, especially in energy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/india-2025-what-kind-of-superpower/articleshow/7239803.cms |title=India 2025: What kind of superpower? |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=2011-01-09 |accessdate=2012-02-10}}</ref>

Robyn Meredith claims that both India and China will be superpowers.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> Although, she points out that the average income of European and Americans are better off than Chinese and Indians, and hundreds of millions of Chinese as well as Indians live in poverty, however she also suggested that economic growth of these nations has been most important factor in reducing global poverty of last two decades as per World Bank report.<ref>Meredith, R (2008) ''The Elephant and the Dragon: The Rise of India and China and What it Means for All of Us'', p.6, "W.W Norton and Company" ISBN 978-0-393-33193-6</ref> [[Amy Chua]] also adds to this, stating that while India's potential for superpower is great, it still faces many problems such as "pervasive rural poverty, entrenched [[Corruption in India|corruption]], and high [[Economic inequality|inequality]] just to name a few". However, she notes that India has made tremendous strides to fix this, stating that some of India's achievements, such as working to dismantle the centuries-old [[caste system]] and maintaining the world's largest diverse democracy is historically unprecedented.<ref name="Chua, A 2007"/>

[[Fareed Zakaria]] also believes that India has a fine chance at becoming a superpower, pointing out that India's young population coupled with the [[List of countries by English-speaking population|second-largest]] [[English language|English]]-speaking population in the world could give India an advantage over China. He also believes that while other industrial countries will face a youth gap, India will have lots of young people, or in other words, workers, and by 2050, its per capita income will rise by twenty times its current level. According to Zakaria, another strength that India has is that its democratic government has lasted for 60 years, stating that a democracy can provide for long-term stability, that has given India a name.<ref>Zakaria, F (2008) ''The Post-American World'', "W.

[[Lant Pritchett]], reviewing the book ''In Spite of the Gods: The Strange Rise of Modern India'', writes that, while India has had impressive growth and has some world-class institutions, several other indicators are puzzlingly poor. The [[malnutrition in India]] and the coverage of [[immunization]] programs are at levels similar or worse than in much sub-Saharan African nations. In the [[Demographic and Health Surveys]], India's child [[malnutrition]] was the worst of the 42 nations with comparable and recent data.<ref name="doi10.1257/jel.47.3.771">{{cite doi|10.1257/jel.47.3.771}}</ref> Adult [[literacy]] is 61%. In one study, 26% of teachers were absent from work and 1/3 of those showing up did not teach. 40% of health care workers were absent from work. [[Caste politics in India]] remains an important force. Pritchett argues that a very large population, a very long statistical "tail" of high quality students, and some very good higher education institutions gives a misleading impression of Indian education. Indian students placed forty-first and thirty-seventh in a study comparing students in the two Indian states [[Orissa]] and [[Rajasthan]] to the forty-six nations in the 2003 [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study]].<ref name="doi10.1257/jel.47.3.771"/>

He says that "Russia won't be a superpower anytime soon", citing Russia's shrinking population, high levels of poverty and poor public health.<ref>[[The Wall Street Journal]]: [http://blogs.wsj.com/capitaljournal/2009/08/26/do-the-math-why-russia-won%E2%80%99t-be-a-superpower-anytime-soon/ Do the Math: Why Russia Won't Be a Superpower Anytime Soon], Peter Brown, August 26, 2009</ref> British historian and professor [[Niall Ferguson]] has also highlighted the negative effects of Russia's declining population,  and suggests that Russia is on its way to "global irrelevance".<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Newsweek]]|url=http://www.newsweek.com/decline-putins-russia-its-way-global-irrelevance-65847|title=In Decline, Putin's Russia Is On Its Way to Global Irrelevance|date=December 12, 2011|accessdate=August 2, 2014}}</ref> Although recent data regarding the population of Russia has shown some modest population growth in 2012 due to immigration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2013/05/11/russias-population-isnt-shrinking-its-growing-very-very-slowly/ |title=Russia's Population Isn't Shrinking (It's Growing Very, Very Slowly) |publisher=Forbes |date= |accessdate=July 8, 2014}}</ref>

===Brazil===
'''[[Brazil]]''' has also seen discussion as a potential superpower, particularly after its showing at the [[2014 World Cup]]. However, Scheherazade Rehman of ''[[U.S. News]]'', also a professor of finance and international affairs at [[George Washington University]], challenges these claims and asserts that Brazil's influence is unlikely to extend beyond [[Latin America]] or economic domination in the foreseeable future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2012/11/27/brazil-will-only-be-a-regional-economic-superpower|publisher=''[[U.S. News]]''|title=Brazil Will Only Be a Regional Economic Superpower|last=Rehman|first=Scheherazade|accessdate=July 7, 2014|date=November 27, 2012}}</ref>

The much higher rate of crime in the country compared to all the other potential superpowers, stubbornly high levels of income and education inequality, social polarization, and the future of the much less developed northern regions of the country remain concerns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1072.html |title=Country Information |publisher=Travel.state.gov |date= |accessdate=July 8, 2014}}</ref>

In an interview, Vladimir Caramaschi, a Brazil strategist, said that "Investment is just not going to be enough to meet demand", he described that that Brazil, historically lags in investment regarding the factories, machinery and other types of fixed capitals, and it has not changed course even as it recovers faster than most of the countries from [[global recession]]. He further adds that Brazil's cost of taxes, bureaucracy, interest rates and labor laws remains the highest among [[G-20 major economies|G20]] economies discourages investment.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fontana |first=Camila |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a1TWjS.qG2GA |title=Brazil No Economic 'Superpower' as Investment Lags: Week Ahead |publisher=Bloomberg |date=December 6, 2009|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}</ref>
