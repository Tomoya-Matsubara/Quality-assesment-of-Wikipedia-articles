'''Albert Leonard Rosen''' (born [[February 29]], [[1924]], in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]]), nicknamed "'''Al,'''" "'''Flip,'''" and the "'''Hebrew Hammer'''," was an [[United States|American]] [[major league]] [[third baseman]] and [[right-handed]] [[slugger]].  He played his entire 10-year career ([[1947]]-56) with the [[Cleveland Indians]] in the [[American League]], where he drove in 100 or more runs 5 years in a row, was a 4-time [[All-Star]], twice led the league in [[home runs]] and twice in [[RBI]]s, and was an [[MVP]].  Rosen was extremely muscular, and had tremendous power and excellent bat control.

Rosen was a .285 career hitter, with 192 home runs and 717 RBIs in 1,044 games.  He was selected for the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] every year between 1952 and 1955.  Rosen appeared on the cover of [[Sports Illustrated]] in [[1955]].

Rosen was one of the best all-time [[Jewish]] baseball players, along with [[Hank Greenberg]] (with whom he became close friends; Greenberg was in the front office with the Indians in the final years of Rosen's career) and [[Sandy Koufax]].[http://jewishmajorleaguers.org/crrldrs/crrldrs.html][http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:qLjcxwk_qZwJ:www.thebaseballpage.com/players/rosenal01.php+%22al+rosen%22+%22hank+greenberg%22+friends&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=3]

==Early life==
Rosen and his family moved to [[Miami]] when he was three years old.  He grew up in the southwest section of Miami, which is now the heart of [[Little Havana]].  Rosen grew up without a father, and was raised by three women:  his grandmother, mother, and aunt.[http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&bid=1275&pid=12230] 

Rosen was an [[asthma]]tic as a child, which had prompted the family's move south.  His two favorite players were [[Lou Gehrig]] and [[Hank Greenberg]].  Rosen attended the [[University of Florida]] in the September session of 1941<U+2013>42, where he played third base for the Gators. 

Rosen enlisted after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and spent 2 years in the [[United States Navy|Navy]] fighting in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific]] during [[World War II]], delaying his professional baseball career.

==Minor League career==
After returning from the Navy in [[1946]], Rosen played for the [[1946]] [[Pittsfield Electrics]], where he was initially given a back-up role.  He led the [[Canadian-American League]] in home runs (16) and RBIs (86), while batting .323, however, and became known as the "'''Hebrew Hammer'''."[http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&bid=1275&pid=12230]

Rosen played for the [[Oklahoma City]] Indians in [[1947]], and had one of the finest individual seasons in league history.  He led all hitters in average (.349), hits (186), doubles (47), extra-base hits (83), RBIs (141), total bases (330), slugging percentage (.619), and on-base percentage (.437).  He was elected [[Texas League]] [[MVP]].[http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&bid=1275&pid=12230]

In [[1948]] Rosen was ''Rookie of the Year'' for [[minor league baseball|Triple-A]] [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] in the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]].

==Major League career; Cleveland Indians==

Rosen made his first appearance in the major leagues in [[1947]] at the age of 23.  The next year he won a [[World Series]] ring with the Indians.

In his first full season, in [[1950]], Rosen led the American League in home runs with 37, hitting more than any previous American League rookie.  He also averaged a league-best homer every 15.0 at bats, and led the league as well in [[HBP]] (10).  He [[Batting average|batted]] .287 and had 116 [[runs batted in]], while coming in 5th in the league with 100 [[walks]] and a .543 [[SP]].  Despite his home run title, he only came in 17th in the [[American League]] [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP Award]] voting.  

In [[1951]] he led the league in games played, and was 5th in the league in RBIs (102), extra-base hits (55), and walks (85).  He batted .265, with 24 home runs.

Rosen led the American League with 105 RBIs and 297 [[total bases]] in [[1952]].  He also was 3rd in the league in runs (101) and slugging percentage (.524), 5th in hits (171) and [[doubles]] (32), 6th in home runs (28), and 7th in batting average (.302).  Still, he only came in 10th in the [[American League]] [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP Award]] voting.

In [[1953 in sports|1953]],  Rosen led the American League in home runs (43), runs batted in (145), runs (115), slugging percentage (.613), and total bases (367).  He also came in second in [[OBP]], and third in hits (201).  He tied for 8th with [[Mickey Mantle]] in [[stolen base]]s.  Defensively, he had the best range factor of all third basemen in the league (3.32), and led it in assists (338) and double plays (38).  

He batted .336, and missed winning the batting title (and with it, the [[Triple Crown]]) on the last day of the season -- by only 1 percentage point, coming in second to [[Mickey Vernon]]. In Washington, the [[Senators]] heard that day that Rosen had made an out in his last at-bat, after getting 3 hits earlier in the game.  Vernon was still ahead. The Senators conspired to make sure Vernon didn't have to bat again.  Mickey Grasso doubled and let himself get picked off.  Then Keith "Kite" Thomas singled, and was out when he ran leisurely to second.

He finally won the [[American League]] [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP Award]] in [[1953 in sports|1953]].  It was by an unprecedented unanimous vote.

In [[1954]], while batting .300, he led the league in [[sacrifice flies]] with 11, was 4th in SP (.506), and 5th in home runs (24), RBI (102), and obp (.404).  He also hit consecutive home runs in the All-Star game despite a broken finger, and was named MVP of the All-Star Game.   
[[Casey Stengel]] said of him: "That young feller, that feller's a ball player.  He'll give you the works every time.  Gets all the hits, gives you the hard tag in the field.  That feller's a real competitor, you bet your sweet curse life."[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,858499,00.html]  Cleveland won the pennant, but lost to the [[New York Giants]] as [[Dusty Rhodes]] hit a home run off of [[Bob Lemon]] to win it, and give the Giants their last world title.  It was his 5th straight year with 100 or more RBIs.  Still, after the season Cleveland cut his $42,500 salary to $37,500.

In [[1955]] Rosen was in the top 10 in the league in at-bats per home run, walks, and sacrifice flies.

Back problems and leg injuries caught up with him, and Rosen retired at the age of 32 in 1956.[http://www.thebaseballpage.com/players/rosenal01.php]

==After Major League career==

After retiring in [[1956]], he became a [[stockbroker]].[http://www.historicbaseball.com/players/r/rosen_al.html]

Rosen reentered baseball 20 years later as as a [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] executive.  He was president (and chief operating officer) of the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]] (1978-79), then the [[Houston Astros|Astros]] (1980-85), and then president and [[general manager]] of the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] (1985-92).  His maneuvering brought San Francisco from last place in [[1985]] to the NL West title in [[1987]].[http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Al_Rosen_1924]

Rosen's wife of 19 years, the former Teresa (Terry) Ann Blumberg, died on May 4, 1971, when she fell to her death from the Warwick Hotel in [[Philadelphia]] under mysterious circumstances.  Rosen has 3 sons:  Andy, Robert, and Jim.  [[Andy Rosen]] is a musician who sings under the name of [[Goat (musician)|Goat]]; he resides in New York City with his wife Ana, who works for the Rain Forest Alliance.  Robert resides in [[Orlando, Florida]], with his wife Linda and is the President of the Southeast Division of Deluca Homes; they have 2 children, Steven and Lauren Rosen.  Jim Rosen resides in [[Los Angeles]] with Rosen's youngest grandchild, Zachary.

Rosen and his second wife, Rita (nee Kallman), have been married for over 30 years.  Rosen occasionally consults for baseball teams, including a stint with the Yankees as special assistant to the general manager in 2001 and 2002.[http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&bid=1275&pid=12230]

== Jewish heritage ==

Rosen was tough (his nose was broken 13 times in his career), an amateur [[boxing|boxer]], and had a reputation for standing up to anyone who dared insult his ancestry.   

Rosen grew up in a Miami neighborhood where Gentile youth called out to him, <U+201C>Lookit the Jewboy.  Go home and eat yuh [[matzo]]s, [[sheeny]].<U+201D> 

Rosen told the sportswriter [[Roger Kahn]] that as a young player in the minors he had moments when he wished his name were not as obviously Jewish as Rosen.  But after he became a major league star, he actually considered changing his name to Rosenthal or Rosenstein so that no one could possibly mistake him for anything but a Jew.  "When I was up in the majors," he said, "I always knew how I wanted it to be about me....Here comes one Jewish kid that every Jew in the world can be proud of."

In [[1951]], the television [[impresario]] [[Ed Sullivan]], in his popular newspaper column, wrote about Rosen:  "Of [[Jewish]] parentage, he is [[Catholic]].  At the plate, you'll notice he makes the sign of the cross with his bat."  Enraged, Rosen insisted on a full and public retraction, pointing out that the mark he always made with his bat was the letter "x."[http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&bid=1275&pid=12230]

Once a [[White Sox]] opponent called him a <U+201C>Jew [[Illegitimacy|bastard]].<U+201D>  Sox pitcher [[Saul Rogovin]], also Jewish, remembered an angry Rosen striding belligerently to the [[Dugout (baseball)|dugout]] and challenging the <U+201C>[[son of a bitch]]<U+201D> to a fight.  The player backed down.[http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:MQk7W-MpjhEJ:nyc.sabr.org/Newsletters/Summer%25202004.pdf+%22al+rosen%22+%22ed+sullivan%22+jewish&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=3]

Rosen challenging an opposing player who had <U+201C>slurred [his] religion<U+201D> to fight him under the stands.  When a [[Red Sox]] catcher called Rosen [[anti-Semitic]] names, he called time and <U+201C>started toward him, to take him on.<U+201D>  [[Hank Greenberg]] recalled that Rosen <U+201C>want[ed] to go into the stands and murder<U+201D> fans who hurled anti-Semitic insults at him. 

During his career, Rosen declined to play on the [[High Holy Days]].

In an article in 1976 in [[Esquire]] magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published an "All Time All-Star Argument Starter," consisting of five ethnic baseball teams.  Rosen was the third baseman on Stein's [[Jewish]] team.
