'''Fedora''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8>f<U+0259><U+02CC>d<U+0254><U+02D0>(<U+0279>).<U+0259>}}) is an [[RPM Package Manager|RPM]]-based, general purpose [[operating system]] built on top of the [[Linux kernel]], developed by the community-supported [[Fedora Project]] and sponsored by [[Red Hat]]. Fedora's mission statement is: "Fedora is about the rapid progress of Free and Open Source software."<ref name="SlashdotMS">{{cite web |url=http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/08/17/177220 | title=Fedora Project Leader Max Spevack Responds | accessdate=2006-12-17|author=Max Spevack}}</ref>

One of Fedora's main objectives is not only to contain [[free software|free]] and [[open source software]], but also to be on the leading edge of such technologies.<ref name="SlashdotMS" /><ref name="FPObjectives">{{cite web | url=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Objectives | title=Fedora Project Objectives | accessdate=2007-02-12 | date=2006-12-19}}</ref> Also, developers in Fedora prefer to make upstream changes instead of applying fixes specifically for Fedora<U+2014>this ensures that updates are available to all [[Linux distribution]]s.<ref>{{ cite news | url=http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2008-May/msg00006.html | title=Fedora 9 | author=Paul W.

[[Linus Torvalds]], creator of the [[Linux kernel]], says he uses Fedora because it had fairly good support for [[PowerPC]] when he used that processor architecture.  He became accustomed to the operating system and continues to use it.<ref name="LinusFedora">{{cite web |url=http://linuxpoison.blogspot.com/2008/07/linus-torvalds-uses-fedora-core-9.html | title=Linus Torvalds uses Fedora 9 | date=2008-06-22 | accessdate=2008-09-10 |author=Nikesh Jauhari}}</ref>

==History==
The Fedora Project was created in late 2003, when [[Red Hat Linux]] was discontinued.<ref name="FPAnnounce">{{ cite news |url=http://www.redhat.com/archives/rhl-list/2003-September/msg00064.html | title=Fedora Project: Announcing New Direction | date=2003-09-22 | accessdate=2007-10-18 }}</ref> [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] was to be Red Hat's only officially supported Linux distribution, while Fedora was to be a community distribution.<ref name="FPAnnounce" /> Red Hat Enterprise Linux branches its releases from versions of Fedora.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.redhat.com/magazine/022aug06/features/fedora_rhel_4/ | title=The Fedora Project and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, part 4 | date=2006-08-22 | accessdate=2007-10-18 }}</ref>

The name of Fedora derives from Fedora Linux, a volunteer project that provided extra software for the Red Hat Linux distribution, and from the characteristic [[Fedora (hat)|fedora]] used in Red Hat's "Shadowman" logo. Fedora Linux was eventually absorbed into the Fedora Project.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20030219051938/www.fedora.us/fedora.html | title=Fedora Network Proposal | accessdate=2006-07-28}}</ref> Fedora is a trademark of Red Hat. Although this has previously been disputed by the creators of the [[Fedora (software)|Fedora repository management software]], the issue has now been resolved.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://fedora.info/redHat.shtml | title=Red Hat Inc.'s Use of The Fedora Name | accessdate=2006-07-28}}</ref>

==Features==
===Distribution===
[[Image:PackageKit on Fedora.png|thumb|250px|[[PackageKit]], the default package manager on Fedora]]

The Fedora Project distributes Fedora in several different ways:<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://docs.fedoraproject.org/install-guide/f8/en_US/ch-new-users.html#sn-howto-download | title=New Users <U+2013> How Do I Download Installation Files? | author=[[Fedora Project]] | accessdate=2007-11-18 }}</ref>
* Fedora DVD <U+2013> a DVD of all major Fedora packages at time of shipping;
* Live images <U+2013> CD or DVD sized images that can be used to create a [[Live CD]] or install Fedora on a [[USB flash drive]];
* Minimal CD or USB image <U+2013> used for installing over [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] or [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]];<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://docs.fedoraproject.org/install-guide/f8/en_US/ch-other-install-methods.html | title=Alternative Install Methods | author=[[Fedora Project]] | accessdate=2007-11-18 }}</ref>
* Rescue CD or USB image <U+2013> used if some part of the system has failed and needs to be fixed, or for installing over the Internet.

The Fedora Project also distributes custom variations of Fedora which are called Fedora spins.<ref>[http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/CustomSpins CustomSpins - Fedora Project Wiki<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> These are built from a specific set of software packages and have a combination of software to meet the requirements of a specific kind of end user. Fedora spins are developed by several Fedora special interest groups.<ref name="Fedora Spins">{{cite web | url=http://spins.fedoraproject.org | title= Custom Spins | author=[[Fedora Project]] | date=2007-11-19 | accessdate=2007-11-19 }}</ref> It is also possible to create [[Live USB]] versions of Fedora using [[Fedora Live USB creator]] or [[UNetbootin]].

Software package management is primarily handled by the [[Yellow dog Updater, Modified|yum]] utility.<ref name="FPYumDoc">{{ cite web | url=http://docs.fedoraproject.org/yum/en/sn-software-management-tools.html | title=Software Management Tools in Fedora Core | author=Stuart Ellis | accessdate=2007-11-18 }}</ref> Graphical interfaces, such as ''pirut'' and ''pup'' are provided, as well as ''puplet'', which provides visual notifications in the panel when updates are available.<ref name="FPYumDoc" /> [[apt-rpm]] is an alternative to yum, and may be more familiar to people used to [[Debian]] or Debian-based distributions, where [[Advanced Packaging Tool]] is used to manage packages.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Tools/Apt | title=APT and Fedora | author=[[Fedora Project]] | accessdate=2007-11-18 }}</ref> Additionally, extra repositories can be added to the system, so that packages not available in Fedora can be installed.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://docs.fedoraproject.org/yum/en/sn-using-repositories.html | title=Using Repositories | author=Stuart Ellis | accessdate=2007-11-18 }}</ref>

===Software repositories===

Before Fedora 7, there were two main repositories <U+2013> Core and Extras. Fedora Core contained all the base packages that were required by the operating system, as well as other packages that were distributed along with the installation CD/DVDs, and was maintained only by Red Hat developers. Fedora Extras, the secondary repository that was included from Fedora Core 3, was community-maintained and not distributed along with the installation CD/DVDs. Since Fedora 7, the Core and Extras repositories have been merged, hence the distribution dropping ''Core'' from its name.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2007-January/msg00091.html |title= Fedora 7 |accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref> That also allowed for community submissions of packages that were formerly allowed only by Red Hat developers.

Also prior to Fedora 7 being released, there was a third repository called Fedora Legacy. This repository was community-maintained and was mainly concerned with extending the life cycle of older Fedora Core distributions and selected Red Hat Linux releases that were no longer officially maintained.<ref name="FPLegacy">{{ cite web | url=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legacy | title=Fedora Legacy | author=[[Fedora Project]] | accessdate=2007-11-18 }}</ref> Fedora Legacy was shut down in December 2006.<ref>{{ cite news | url=http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-legacy-list/2006-December/msg00049.html | title=Fedora Legacy shutting down | author=David Eisenstein | date=2006-12-29 | accessdate=2007-11-18 }}</ref>

There are also third party repositories aimed at Fedora, which contain software that cannot be put in the official repositories for licensing or support reasons. The two most prominent third-party repositories are RPMforge and RPM fusion. Both distribute software that Fedora will not, either because it does not meet Fedora's definition of Free Software, or because distribution of that software may violate US law.

'''RPMforge''' is a combination of four software repositories:
* '''Dag''', made by Dag Wie<U+00EB>rs [http://dag.wieers.com/rpm/], with support for RHEL, CentOS and old Red Hat;
* '''Freshrpms''', made by Matthias Saou [http://freshrpms.net/] for latest Fedora;
* '''Dries''', made by Dries Verachtert: [http://dries.ulyssis.org/rpm/], for Fedora; and
* '''Arrotin''', made by Fabian Arrotin: [http://rpms.arrfab.net/rpmforge/], with support for RHEL PPC and CentOS PPC, which joined RPMforge later than the other three repositories.<ref>RPM Forge FAQ, https://rpmrepo.org/RPMforge/FAQ</ref>

'''RPM Fusion''' is a combination of another three software repositories:

* '''Livna''', made by Damien Nad<U+00E9>, [http://rpm.livna.org]] (whilst this is mostly deprecated,[[libdvdcss]] remains in the Livna repository due to copyright concerns<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://rpm.livna.org/fedora/10/00_PLEASE_READ.txt | title=Please Read | date=2008-11-09 | accessdate=2008-12-01 }}</ref>);
* '''Dribble''', which concentrates on, but is not limited to, multimedia, games and emulators;<ref>Dribble FAQ, http://dribble.org.uk/faq.html</ref> and
* '''Freshrpms''', made by Matthias Saou in 2000 for his own usage.<ref>Freshrpms history, http://freshrpms.net/about/</ref>

===Security features===
Security is one of the most important features in Fedora. One of the security features in Fedora is [[Security-Enhanced Linux]], a Linux feature that implements a variety of security policies, including mandatory access controls, through the use of [[Linux Security Modules]] (LSM) in the [[Linux (kernel)|Linux]] kernel. Fedora is one of the distributions leading the way with SELinux.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://w3.linux-magazine.com/issue/69/Access_Control_with_SELinux.pdf | title=Mandatory Access Control with SELinux | accessdate=2007-10-07 |format=PDF}}</ref> SELinux was introduced in Fedora Core 2. It was disabled by default, as it radically altered how the operating system worked, but was enabled by default in Fedora Core 3 and introduced a less strict, ''targeted'' policy.<ref name="FC2 RN">{{cite web|url=http://docs.fedoraproject.org/release-notes/fc2/x86/ |title=Fedora Core 2 Release Notes | accessdate=2007-10-19}}</ref><ref name="FC3 RN">{{cite web|url=http://docs.fedoraproject.org/release-notes/fc3/x86/ |title=Fedora Core 3 Release Notes | accessdate=2007-10-19}}</ref>

Fedora also has methods in place to prevent some buffer overflow exploits and root kits from functioning. Compile time buffer checks, [[Exec Shield]] and restrictions on how kernel memory in /dev/mem can be accessed help to prevent this.<ref name="FC1 RN">{{cite web|url=http://docs.fedoraproject.org/release-notes/fc1/x86/ |title=Fedora Core 1 Release Notes | accessdate=2007-10-19}}</ref>

[[Image:Fedora Core 6.png|thumb|Fedora Core 6 with the DNA theme]]

The last two cores introduced specific artwork that defined them. This is a trend that has continued in later Fedora versions.

''Fedora Core 5'' was released on March 20, 2006, with the codename Bordeaux, and introduced the Fedora Bubbles artwork.<ref name="FC5Rel">{{ cite news | url=http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2006-March/msg00027.html | title=Announcing the release of Fedora Core 5 | date=2006-03-20 | accessdate=2007-10-18 }}</ref> It was the first Fedora release to include [[Mono (software)|Mono]] and tools built with it such as [[Beagle (software)|Beagle]], [[F-Spot]] and [[Tomboy (software)|Tomboy]].<ref name="FC5Rel" /> It also introduced new package management tools such as pup and pirut (''see [[Yellow dog Updater, Modified]]'').
