==Plot introduction==
''Inside Mr Enderby'' is the first book in the [[Enderby (fictional character)|Enderby]] series and follows the life in Brighton (UK) of a mid-40s poet by the name of Francis Xavier Enderby.  Enderby's career as a poet advances, and his career as a bachelor is put into jeopardy.

==Plot summary==
{{spoiler}}
The story opens by introducing the [[dyspepsia|dyspeptic]] [[poet]], Francis Xavier Enderby. Enderby is in his mid-40's, a lapsed Catholic, who lives alone in [[Brighton]] as a 'professional' poet - his income being interest from investments left to him by his stepmother.

Enderby composes his poetry whilst seated on the toilet. His nearby bathtub serving as a filing cabinet is almost full of paper and food scraps that represent his efforts. Although he is recognised as a minor poet with several published works (and even awarded a small prize, the 'Goodby Gold Medal', which he refuses), he has yet to be anthologised.

He is persuaded to leave his bachelor life by the editor of a woman's magazine, one Vesta Bainbridge. Although it transpires that Ms Bainbridge was simply desirous of Enderby's capital, they remain married for almost a year.

==Trivia==
Anthony Burgess wrote a review of Joseph Kell's book for the ''Yorkshire Post''. "[W]hen the editor sent him the author's novel - Burgess thought it was a practical joke but it wasn't." <ref>{{cite web | title="Joke" story told in this article about Anthony Burgess | url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/burgess.htm }}</ref>
When the paper found out that Kell was one of Burgess's pen names, Burgess was removed from his reviewing duties.<ref>{{cite web | title="Removal" mentioned in this online Anthony Burgess biography | url=http://enc.slider.com/Enc/Anthony_Burgess }}</ref>

==Literary significance & criticism==
<blockquote>"Mr. Burgess is so fond of Enderby - by far his best creation - that he has devoted four books to him: ''Inside Mr. Enderby'' and ''Enderby Outside,'' which were published in 1968, ''The Clockwork Testament'' in 1975, and now, ''Enderby's Dark Lady.''" - Anatole Broyard, ''The New York Times''.
