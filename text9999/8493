'''Carillon Historical Park''' is a 65-acre (26.3 ha) park and museum in [[Dayton, Ohio]], which contains historic buildings and exhibits concerning the history of technology and the history of Dayton and its residents from 1796 to the present.  The historical elements of the park were the brainchild of [[Edward A. Deeds|Colonel Edward Deeds]].

The Kettering Family Education Center anchors the park which is divided into major sections covering settlement, transportation, invention, and industry.  An original lock of the [[Miami and Erie Canal]]is located on the grounds as well as a canal toll office.  The transportation center has a Barney and Smith Passenger Car, built in Dayton as well as an [[interurban]] railcar and other vehicles associated with Dayton. The world's first practical airplane, the [[1905]] [[Wright Flyer III]] is located at the park.  The airplane, a unit of [[Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park]], was restored from 1948 to 1950 with the initial consultation of [[Orville Wright]] before his 1948 death.

In [[2005]], Carillon Historical Park merged with the [[Montgomery County Historical Society]] to form [[Dayton History]].

===Deeds Carillon===
The park is named for the 151-foot-tall (46 m) Deeds [[Carillon]]. The art moderne-style carillon tower was built in 1942, funded by Edward Deeds' wife Edith Walton Deeds and was designed to commemorate the Deeds family. When the tower was built, each of 23 bells was inscribed with the name of a family member, with the <U+201C>silent<U+201D> bells bearing the names of deceased family members and ringing bells cast with the names of family members then living. Today, with 57 bells, the carillon is Ohio<U+2019>s largest. The [[National Park Service]] listed the Deeds Carillon on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2005.

Carillon Park refurbished the carillon in 1988, converting it from an electric keyboard controlled instrument to a traditional, baton-keyboard mechanical carillon. The Park's carillonneur, Larry Weinstein performs live carillon concerts every Sunday at 3:00 from May to October.
