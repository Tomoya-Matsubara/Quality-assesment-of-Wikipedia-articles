:''"Khalid Saeed Ahmad al Zahrani. He traveled to Afghanistan illegally after being prohibited by Saudi authorities from leaving Saudi Arabia. After being assigned to a mission in the U.S., he secretly reentered the Kingdom but failed in an attempt to have his name removed from the list of prohibited travelers so that he could obtain a U.S. visa. See Intelligence reports, interrogations of detainee, [[April 20]], [[2002]]; [[October 4]], [[2002]]; [[April 3]], [[2003]].

He was sent, but failed, to convince [[Mushabib al-Hamlan]] not to abandon his training, after al-Hamlan left the training camp to remain with his ill mother.

He was later selected for an unknown mission in the United States, believed to have been the 9/11 hijackings, and re-entered Saudi Arabia to apply for a legitimate travel [[visa (document)|visa]], but was denied an application because his name was on a Saudi watchlist of persons to be refused to travel outside the country.

In 2005, he partook in a [[hunger strike]] to protest the [[Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005|Qur'an desecration controversy]][http://www.cageprisoners.com/prisoners.php?id=132]
