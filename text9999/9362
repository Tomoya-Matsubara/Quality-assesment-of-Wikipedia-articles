The '''Florida mouse''' ('''''Podomys floridanus''''') is a species of [[rodent]] in the [[Cricetidae]] family. It is the [[Monotype (biology)|only]] species in the genus '''''Podomys''''', which is the only mammal genus [[Endemism|endemic]] to Florida.  The Florida mouse (also known as the big-eared deermouse, the Florida deermouse, and the gopher mouse)<ref name="NAMFM">''North American Mammals: Florida Mouse''</ref><ref name="Jones3">Jones 1993, p. 3</ref> is found only in a limited area in central peninsular Florida and in one small area in the [[Florida panhandle]]. The mouse inhabits some of Florida's hottest and driest areas in the high pinelands, [[sandhill]]s, flatlands, and coastal [[Florida scrub|scrub]].

The mouse is an [[omnivore]], measures {{convert|195|mm|abbr=on}} in total length, has relatively large ears, and displays brown to orange upperparts and white underparts.  The mouse breeds throughout the year, and raises its two or three young per litter in the nesting chambers and passages it constructs in the [[burrow]] of the gopher tortoise (''[[Gopherus polyphemus]]'').  Real estate development and a decline in the gopher tortoise population threaten the mouse's future. The species is listed as [[Vulnerable]] by the [[IUCN]].

== Description ==
The Florida mouse displays a soft and silky [[pelage]], brown above and orange on the cheeks, shoulders, and lower sides. Underparts are white. The young are gray.  The species has a [[skunk]]-like odor.<ref name="Wtr314"/> The mouse has relatively large, nearly naked ears (16&nbsp;mm long or more), a relatively short tail approximately 80% of total body length, and large hind feet (24&nbsp;mm long or more) with five, rather than the usual six, plantar [[tubercle]]s.<ref name="Jones1"/><ref name="Wtr314"/>   There is no difference in appearance between males and females.<ref name="NAMFM"/>

[[File:DiGangi-Deermouse.jpg|thumb|The appearance of the the Florida mouse is similar to  the  ''Peromyscus'' shown  in  this ilustration]]

The mouse looks like ''[[Peromyscus]]'', and was once placed as a [[monotype|monotypic]] subgenus in the genus ''Peromyscus'' The greater size and distinctive coloration of ''Podomys floridanus'' distinguish it from the [[cotton mouse]] (''[[Peromyscus gossypinus]]'') and [[oldfield mouse]] (''[[Peromyscus polionotus]]''), which also occur in Florida.<ref name="Jones1"/><ref name="Wtr314"/>

In 1973, a [[biochemical]] [[polymorphism]] study was conducted in four sample areas of the species. Electrophoretically demonstrable variation was found in one or more populations at 15 of 39 (38%) of the loci examined, and two and sometimes three [[alleles]] per locus were detected. At the least, the findings give an indication of the kind of genetic variation that may be found between populations within a species. The amount of variation was similar to findings in examinations of ''[[Peromyscus polionotus]]'', ''[[Sigmodon]]'', and ''[[Dipodomys]]''.<ref name="Wtr314"/>

Average measurements reported in 1993 of 30 adults were: total length {{convert|195|mm|abbr=on}} {{convert|178|-|220|mm|abbr=on}}; tail {{convert|88|mm|abbr=on}} {{convert|80|-|101|mm|abbr=on}}; hind foot {{convert|26|mm|abbr=on}} {{convert|24|-|28|mm|abbr=on}}; ear {{convert|19|mm|abbr=on}} {{convert|16|-|21.5|mm|abbr=on}}. The [[diploid number]] is 48 and [[dentition]] 1/1 0/0 0/0 3/3 total 16.<ref name="Wtr314"/>

==Taxonomy==
The mouse was first described by [[Frank Chapman]] in 1889 in a paper in the ''[[Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History]]'', from a specimen collected at [[Gainesville, Florida]].<ref name="Wtr316">Whitaker 1998, p. 316</ref><ref>Chapman, 1889</ref> The species was named as a separate [[subgenus]] of ''Peromyscus'' by [[Wilfred Hudson Osgood]] in 1909, but generic recognition was disputed in the 1980s. Michael Carleton and [[Guy Musser]] supported the ranking in 1993.<ref name="Haf113">Hafner 1993, p. 113</ref> No subspecies have been described.<ref name="Wtr316" />

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Monahans Sandhills Dune 2009.jpg|thumb|left|Dry places such as [[sandhills]] are common habitats for ''Podomys''.]]
''Podomys'' is the only mammal genus [[Endemism|endemic]] only to Florida.<ref name="Jones1">Jones 1993, p. 1</ref><ref name="Wtr314"/><!-- and ''Podomys floridanus'' and ''[[Oryzomys argentatus]]'' are the only mammal species endemic to Florida.<ref name="Wtr314"/> Taking this sentence out for now: ''Oryzomys argentatus'' is currently not considered a valid species, and the shrew ''Blarina shermani'', found only in peninsular Florida, is. Can't find a reference listing these two as the only two FL endemic mammals. - Ucucha--> The Florida mouse is found coast to coast in central peninsular Florida. An isolated population is found in the [[Florida panhandle]] at [[Franklin County, Florida]].<ref name="Jones1"/><ref name="Wtr314"/>  The species occurs from north-central Florida south to [[Highlands County]] and [[Sarasota County]].  It is found along the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]] from [[St. Johns County]] south to [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]].<ref name="FG"/>

The mouse inhabits some of Florida's driest locations. It is common in the [[sand pine]] (''Pinus clausa'') [[Florida scrub|scrub]] and the high [[pineland]]s of turkey oak (''[[Quercus laevis]]'') and longleaf pine (''[[Pinus palustris]]''), and is found in the slash pine (''[[Pinus elliottii]]'') and turkey oak habitat of the southern ridge [[sandhill]]s, and in scrubby flatlands, and in coastal scrub associations.<ref name="Wtr314">Whitaker 1998, p. 314</ref>  Home ranges average roughly {{convert|1|acre|ha}},<ref name="Pergams"/> and are smaller in the flatlands. Populations are greater in the scrub and flatlands than in the highlands.<ref name="Wtr316"/> Its largest populations may occur within [[Ocala National Forest]] and the scrubs along [[Lake Wales Ridge]].<ref name="FG"/>

==Behavior==
The Florida mouse is [[nocturnal]],<ref name="NAMFM"/> and is active throughout the year except on especially cold nights.<ref name="FG">''Field Guide [...] Florida Mouse''</ref> The mouse can climb, but is primarily a terrestrial species. In laboratory experiments, ''P. floridanus'' used its forepaws to dig and throw substrate backwards while other species mainly used their hindfeet to do the same.<ref name="Jones3"/>

===Shelter===
[[File:Gopher tortoise entering burrow.JPG|thumb|Gopher tortoise burrow entrance]]
The Florida mouse has been called the gopher mouse because it shares the long, deep [[burrow]] of the gopher tortoise (''[[Gopherus polyphemus]]'').  The mouse makes nest chambers, small side passages, sometimes a pad of oak leaves and [[wiregrass]]es for chamber floors, and small chimney openings in the roof of the burrow.  It uses these openings, the main entrance, and side passages for entrance to and exit from the burrow.<ref name="Wtr314-5">Whitaker 1998, pp. 314-5</ref>  In the absence of gopher tortoise burrows, the mouse will use those of the oldfield mouse (''Peromyscus polionotus'') or will make its own.<ref name="FG"/>

===Diet===
The Florida mouse is an [[omnivore]] and its diet consists of [[acorn]]s when available, [[insect]]s, [[seed]]s, [[Nut (fruit)|nut]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]], and other plant material and [[vertebrate]]s.<ref name="Pergams"/><ref name="Wtr315"/>  A 1987 report indicates the mouse feeds on engorged [[tick]]s (''Ornithodorus turicata americanus'') that parasitize gopher frogs (''[[Rana areolata]]'') and gopher tortoises.<ref name="Wtr315">Whitaker 1998, p. 315</ref>

===Reproduction===
Florida mice breed throughout the year with a peak between July and December, a lesser peak in January and February, and a lull or cessation in April and May. Unlike most [[murid]]s, [[copulation|copulatory behavior]] lacks intravaginal thrusting, the [[intromission]] thrust is more intense than the dismount, there is no lock, and [[ejaculation]] occurs with every thrust.<ref name="Jones3"/>

[[Gestation]] is about 23 or 24 days.<ref name="Wtr315-6"/>  The mice dig side burrows off the main burrow of the gopher tortoise, line them with shredded plant material, and use them as nurseries.<ref name="NAMFM"/> In eight litters of young conceived in the wild but born in the laboratory, litter size numbers varied from two to four for an average of 3.1 per litter.<ref name="Wtr315-6"/> The young are born in nests in the burrow.<ref name="Pergams"/> Newborn weigh {{convert|1.9|-|2.9|g|abbr=on}} and measure in total length {{convert|44|mm|abbr=on}}; tail length {{convert|12|mm|abbr=on}}; and hind foot length {{convert|8|mm|abbr=on}}.  Teeth begin appearing on the fourth day, the young are active and agile about the 10th day, and the eyes open about the 16th day.  Nursing is virtually non-stop for the first two weeks of life.<ref name="NAMFM"/>  Weaning occurs at three to four weeks, and the young display adult behavior at this time.<ref name="Wtr315-6">Whitaker 1998, pp. 315-6</ref>

===Survival===
[[Ectoparasite]]s are seven species of [[mite]]s, five [[tick]]s, five [[flea]]s, a [[louse]], and the [[subdermal]] [[botfly]] [[larva]], ''Cuterebra''. Known [[endoparasite]]s are three species of [[protozoan]]s found in fecal smears, one [[trematode]], four [[cestode]]s, seven [[nematode]]s, and nymphal [[pentastomid]]s found in various internal organs.<ref name="Wtr316"/>

In 2010, exact population size was unknown, but estimated to be in the several thousands and decreasing.<ref name="Pergams"/>  Presumed predators are [[snakes]], [[birds of prey]], [[bobcat]]s, [[raccoon]]s, and [[fox]]es.  A high number of shortened tails have been observed in the mice and a modified [[integument]] in the tail facilitates tail loss, probably as an anti-predator mechanism.<ref name="Wtr316"/>

Few wild individuals have a [[lifespan]] of over a year, though captive individuals may live for several years.<ref name="Pergams"/> One captive male lived seven years, four months.<ref name="Wtr316">Whitaker 1998, p. 316</ref>

==Relations with humans and conservation==
The species in all probability has little or no direct impact or influence on human interests and concerns but agricultural and real estate development are a threat to the species' very narrow habitat. Collecting specimens in the dry ridges is complicated by the millions of ants which eat the bait in the trap the moment it is set on the ground. Live collecting is the alternative, but the bait is usually digested by the time the animal is taken from the trap, making food research difficult if not impossible.<ref name="Wtr316"/>

As early as 1998, the Florida mouse was a federal C2 candidate taxon, and considered Threatened by the Florida Committee on Rare and Endangered Plants and Animals. The mouse was named a Species of Special Concern by the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.<ref name="Haf113" /> The Florida mouse inhabits a restricted habitat in the United States and that habitat is threatened not only by agricultural and real estate development but by [[wildfire suppression]]. Habitat decline is expected to continue into the future.<ref name="Pergams"/><ref name="Wtr316"/>  The mouse is dependent upon gopher tortoise burrows, but disease and habitat loss are responsible for decline in the tortoise population.<ref name="Pergams"/> [[Red imported fire ant]]s (''Solenopsis invicta'') threaten both tortoise and mouse populations. The [[IUCN]] has listed the species as [[Vulnerable]] and recommends further study of the species, maintenance of viable populations of gopher tortoises, and the preservation and management of suitable habitat for the species.<ref name="Pergams">Pergams and NatureServe, 2008</ref> The mouse is protected on several conservation lands across central Florida.<ref name="FG"/> Occurrences of the Florida mouse are protected at [[Archbold Biological Station]], [[Ocala National Forest]], and others.<ref name="Pergams"/>
