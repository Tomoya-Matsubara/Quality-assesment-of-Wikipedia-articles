A '''disk image emulator''' is [[computer software]] designed to emulate a [[disk image]], usually of a [[Compact Disc|CD]] or [[DVD]], on a local [[hard drive]] or [[USB flash drive]]. The emulation is usually done by creating a [[virtual drive]] on the system, that to the [[operating system]] looks like an ordinary [[disk drive]].

In short, it puts a permanent copy of a disc on a hard drive, making the disc accessible when the disc isn't in the computer.

Some operating systems such as [[Linux]]<ref name="linuxhelp">{{cite web |url= http://www.linuxhelp.net/linux_downloads/ |title= Linux ISO Images |publisher= LinuxHelp.net |accessdate= 2007-03-23 }}</ref>
and [[Mac OS X]]<ref name="osx-dim">Although OS X's built-in DiskImageMounter software does not emulate a physical drive</ref>
have this functionality built-in (see [[loop device]]), while others such as [[Microsoft Windows]] require additional software.

==Uses==
* Enables users to avoid constantly switching out discs
* Helps prevent scratching, which can cause permanent damage to a disc
* Speeds up access times as hard drives are faster than optical drives
* Provides a backup copy of a disc, in case the original becomes damaged, lost, or stolen
* Enables users to carry large disc libraries without the physical burden of the discs
* Emulates multiple disks, which is useful for installing or using software that shipped on multiple disks
* Can make a disc accessible to users on a [[Computer networking|network]], which is very practical when it is impossible to distribute the discs to all of the users on a network
* Allows programs that can normally only work with optical discs (like some [[DVD-Video]] applications) to access data on a hard drive
* For often-used CD and DVD discs, where simply copying the disc to a hard drive won't work
* A CD/DVD master used to burn physical discs
* Make disc accessible to machines without disc drive
* Save power by turning off disc drive, for instance on laptops
* [[Quiet PC | Makes the computer quieter]], many removable disc drives are noisier than hard disks

==Software distribution==
Some software programs are available by means of disk images which can be downloaded from the internet. Thanks to the spread of broadband internet, this has become a primary distribution method for [[Linux distribution]]s,<ref name="linuxhelp">{{cite web |url= http://www.linuxhelp.net/linux_downloads/ |title= Linux ISO Images |publisher= LinuxHelp.net |accessdate= 2007-03-23 }}</ref> which typically comprise one or more CDs of data. This has also been used by some companies for software which must be run from CD, such as bootable recovery CDs.<ref name="para-db">{{cite web |url= http://www.drive-backup.com/glossary/recovery_cd.htm |title= Drive Backup 7.0 |publisher= [[Paragon Software GmbH]] |accessdate= 2007-03-23 |quote= Recovery CD self-burning ISO image is available for download online to all registered customers of Paragon products. }}</ref>

===Copyright infringement of software===
Disk image emulators may be used to aid in [[copyright infringement of software]] by facilitating the use of disk images of [[proprietary software]] distributed over the [[Internet]], often via [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]]. However, since disk image emulation software has many legitimate uses and does not usually promote copyright infringement, it typically is not considered to violate legislation such as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]].
