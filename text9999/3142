The '''2003 Atlantic hurricane season''' was an ongoing event in the annual cycle of [[tropical cyclone]] formation. It officially started [[June 1]], [[2003]], and lasted until [[November 30]], [[2003]], although really lasted from [[April 20]] to [[December 11]] due to unusual events.

The season was tied for the sixth most active on record, behind the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]], [[1933 Atlantic hurricane season|1933]], [[1995 Atlantic hurricane season|1995]], [[1887 Atlantic hurricane season|1887]], and [[1969 Atlantic hurricane season|1969]] seasons, and tied with the [[1936 Atlantic hurricane season|1936 season]]. Two unusual events happened in the 2003 season. The first was the formation of [[Tropical Storm Ana (2003)|Tropical Storm Ana]], the first Atlantic tropical storm on record to form in April. The other was the December formation of Tropical Storms Odette and Peter, making 2003 the first time two Atlantic tropical storms formed in December since the [[1887 Atlantic hurricane season]].

Other notable storms include [[Hurricane Isabel]], which reached [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] strength, [[Hurricane Juan]] which caused considerable destruction to [[Atlantic Canada]], particularly [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], and [[Hurricane Fabian]], which caused $300 million in damage to [[Bermuda]].

== Storms ==
=== Tropical Storm Ana ===
{{hurricane main|Tropical Storm Ana (2003)}}
{{storm pics|Ana satellite image and storm track.|Subtropical Storm Ana.jpg|Ana 2003 track.png}}
Ana formed as a [[subtropical storm]] on [[April 20]] as a non-tropical low, and began taking on tropical characteristics. By [[April 21]], Subtropical Storm Ana had developed a warm core and was designated a tropical storm. By [[April 24]] it had become [[extratropical]], and was absorbed by a frontal system near [[Portugal]] two days later.  It was the only Atlantic storm ever to have formed in April in recorded history. A subtropical storm in the [[1992 Atlantic hurricane season]] was the first ever recorded tropical or subtropical cyclone in April, though there have likely been others that were undetected.

=== Tropical Storm Bill ===
{{storm pics|Bill satellite image and storm track.|Tropical Storm Bill (2003).jpg|Bill 2003 track.png}}

On [[June 29]], a low pressure area drifting north over the southern [[Gulf of Mexico]] organized into a tropical depression over the [[Yucatan Peninsula]], an unusual occurance as tropical cyclones don't usually form over land. The depression moved offshore and strengthened into Tropical Storm Bill. Initially disorganized, it moved northward, steadily strengthening while becoming more tropical. Bill crossed the gulf, and made landfall west of [[Cocodrie, Louisiana]] with winds of 60 mph. Although a relatively weak storm, Bill is blamed for four deaths and $50 million in estimated damages.

=== Hurricane Claudette ===
{{hurricane main|Hurricane Claudette (2003)}}
{{storm pics|Claudette satellite image and storm track.|Hurricane Claudette (2003).jpg|Claudette 2003 track.png}}

The system that became Claudette was recognized as a tropical depression near the [[Windward Islands]] on [[July 7]]. By [[July 11]], Claudette had reached the [[Yucatan Peninsula]]. A few hours after landfall at [[Puerto Morelos]], Claudette emerged over the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Claudette would restrengthen, and made landfall a second time on [[July 15]] at [[Matagorda Island]] near [[Port O'Connor, Texas]] as a strong Category 1 storm. After its final landfall, Claudette remained at tropical storm strength for more than a day, an unusual occurrence. Most tropical systems weaken rapidly after landfall, as they are separated from the warm waters that power them.

Claudette was responsible for one direct death, from a falling tree. Inland towns in Texas, such as [[Goliad, Texas|Goliad]] sustained significant wind damage. Estimated US damage was $180 million. No significant damage was reported from [[Mexico]].

=== Hurricane Danny ===
{{storm pics|Danny satellite image and storm track.|Hurricane Danny (2003).jpg|Danny 2003 track.png}}

Hurricane Danny was named on [[July 17]] in the open ocean east of [[Bermuda]] from a tropical wave. Initially expected to remain a tropical depression, Danny began the northeastward leg of an anti-cyclonic loop around an area of high pressure in the central Atlantic, and strengthened over unusually favorable conditions in the north Atlantic for July. The storm reached hurricane strength on [[July 18]], but weakened 24 hours later over the cool waters of the north Atlantic. By [[July 21]] Danny had lost its identity as a tropical cyclone. Danny caused no reported damage and never threatened land.
{{clear}}

=== Hurricane Erika ===
{{storm pics|Erika satellite image and storm track.|Hurricane Erika (2003).jpg|Erika 2003 track.png}}

Hurricane Erika formed out of a non-tropical low first spotted 1000 nm east of Bermuda on [[August 9]]. As it approached Florida on [[August 14]], the low began taking on tropical characteristics, and almost developed a closed circulation. When the low emerged into the Gulf of Mexico, the presence of a fully closed circulation and active convection resulted in a classification as Tropical Storm Erika.

A high pressure system over the southern United States caused Erika to move quickly westerward. On [[August 16]], Erika's motion slowed and the storm intensified. Landfall was at [[Boca San Rafael]], about 40 miles south of [[Matamoros]], Mexico.

Erika was not classified as a hurricane while active. A post-storm analysis of radar data revealed sustained hurricane force winds just before landfall, and the storm was upgraded after the fact.

Erika was responsible for two deaths due to flooding in Mexico. Large amounts of flood-related damage were reported in north-eastern Mexico. South [[Texas]] reported only minor damage from the outskirts of the storm.

=== Hurricane Fabian ===
{{hurricane main|Hurricane Fabian}}
{{storm pics|Fabian satellite image and storm track.|Hurricane Fabian.jpg|Fabian 2003 track.png}}

Fabian was a powerful [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]] that formed in late August in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It moved generally west-northwestward, peaking at 145 mph before turning to the northwest. On [[September 5]], Fabian hit [[Bermuda]] at Category 3 strength. Although it was not technically a landfall, Fabian's eyewall passed directly over the island, causing severe damage. The hurricane continued to the northeast, became extratropical on [[September 8]], and dissipated on the 9th in the north Atlantic. Fabian was responsible for eight deaths, and caused an estimated 300 million USD in damage to Bermuda, making it the worst Bermuda hurricane since 1926. Because of its destruction, the name was retired after this season, and will be replaced by Fred in 2009.

=== Tropical Storm Grace ===
{{storm pics|Grace satellite image and storm track.|Tropical Storm Grace (2003).jpg|Grace 2003 track.png}}

Tropical Storm Grace formed from a disturbance in the central Gulf of Mexico on [[August 30]]. Grace was an ill-defined storm which formed a second circulation center. The second, stronger center moved onshore near [[San Luis Pass]] at the western end of [[Galveston Island]] on [[August 31]]. The storm  quickly weakened and merged with a frontal system in eastern [[Oklahoma]]. While Grace was responsible for heavy rainfall along the Texas coast, no deaths and no significant damage were reported.
{{clear}}

=== Tropical Storm Henri ===
{{storm pics|Henri satellite image and storm track.|Tropical Storm Henri (2003).jpg|Henri 2003 track.png}}
Henri formed from a tropical wave in the Gulf of Mexico on [[September 5]]. Under the influence of a mid-latitude trough, it moved eastward. Despite strong wind shear, Henri's winds  quickly increased to 60 mph, but fell off to 30 kt before landfall as a tropical depression near [[Clearwater, Florida]]. It crossed the state, and dissipated on the 9th off the North Carolina coast due to vertical shear. The extratropical renmant moved northward, and moved inland on September 12, bringing heavy rain to the Mid-Atlantic. Henri was responsible for up to 10 inches of rainfall across Florida, but was not directly responsible for any deaths, and damage was minor.
{{clear}}

=== Hurricane Isabel ===
{{hurricane main|Hurricane Isabel}}
{{storm pics|Isabel satellite image and storm track.|Hurricane Isabel.JPG|Isabel 2003 track.png}}

A tropical wave off the coast of Africa was named Tropical Storm Isabel on [[September 6]]. The storm moved westward and intensified to hurricane strength. By [[September 11]], Isabel had reached Category 5 strength, with winds of 165 mi/h. Isabel would remain at or near Category 5 for 5 days while moving west-northwest across the Atlantic. On [[September 15]], as Isabel approached the [[Bahamas]], vertical wind shear increased, and Isabel began to weaken. Now on a more northern track, Isabel made landfall near [[Drum Inlet, North Carolina]] on [[September 18]] at Category 2 strength. Isabel remained a hurricane until it reached southern Virginia, and was eventually absorbed by a larger system over far northern [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], near [[James Bay]], maintaining at least tropical storm intensity for most of the way up.
{{clear}}

Isabel was directly responsible for 16 deaths, 10 in Virginia. Indirect deaths were more numerous, with 35 people losing their lives across nine states, the District of Columbia and Canada. Widespread damage was reported, most in Virginia and not in North Carolina as one would expect. Total damages were estimated at $3.37 billion, with two-thirds of that total applying to Virginia.

=== Hurricane Juan ===
{{hurricane main|Hurricane Juan}}
{{storm pics|Juan satellite image and storm track.|Hurricane Juan.jpg|Juan 2003 track.png}}

A large upper-level low combined with a westward moving tropical wave developed into a tropical depression on [[September 24]]. Initially subtropical in nature yet classified tropical, it strengthened and reached tropical storm strength on [[September 25]], while 300 nm southeast of Bermuda. Juan moved northward, strengthening into a hurricane on the 26th and peaking at 105 mph on the 27th, due to warmer than usual water temperatures. Juan continued northward and made landfall near [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] as a strong Category 2 hurricane with sustained winds of 160 km/h. Juan was directly responsible for eight deaths, and is considered the worst hurricane to hit Halifax in 110 years. The name Juan was retired after this season, and will be replaced by Joaquin in the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season.
{{clear}}

=== Hurricane Kate ===
{{storm pics|Kate satellite image and storm track.|Hurricane Kate (2003).jpg|Kate 2003 track.png}}

Kate formed from a depression in the in the open Atlantic on [[September 27]]. Kate followed an unusual path, often changing directions radically. The system took the NHC off track. Kate eventually strengthened to a strong Category 3 hurricane, and slipped southeast of [[Newfoundland]] while a Category 1 hurricane. It eventually headed northward and became extratropical. No significant damage or fatalities were reported in relation to Kate, although heavy rain was reported in coastal areas of southeastern Newfoundland. Hurricane Kate was most remembered for the fear it brought to the [[Canadian Hurricane Centre]] as it neared Canada, especially being less than a week after [[Hurricane Juan]].
{{clear}}

=== Tropical Storm Larry ===
{{storm pics|Larry satellite image and storm track.|Tropical Storm Larry (2003).jpg|Larry 2003 track.png}}

A westward moving tropical wave developed a weak low pressure system to the east of the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] on [[September 27]]. It moved westward, and became associated with a cold front. An extratropical storm formed late on [[September 30]], and while drifting over the warm waters of the Bay of Campeche, it became Tropical Storm Larry on [[October 1]]. A strong ridge of high pressure from Florida to Texas prevented any northward motion, leaving Larry to nearly stall. Larry meandered slowly southward, steadily strengthening to a 65 mph tropical storm. The storm made landfall in [[Tabasco]] near Paraiso on the 6th, and dissipated later that day. The renmant low crossed over into the Pacific where it dissipated on [[October 7]]. Five deaths were officially reported, due to inland flooding.
{{clear}}

=== Tropical Storm Mindy ===
{{storm pics|Mindy satellite image and storm track.|Tropical Storm Mindy (2003).JPG|Mindy 2003 track.png}}

A strong tropical wave with a weak circulation that had just passed over the [[Dominican Republic]] was named Tropical Storm Mindy on [[October 10]]. It moved to the west-northwest, where it briefly reached a peak of 45 mph winds. Conditions were never favorable for development, and on October 12 Mindy weakened to a depression. Two days later, the storm had dissipated completely. Mindy caused significant rainfall over [[Puerto Rico]] and the Dominican Republic, but caused no reported damages or fatalities.
{{clear}}

=== Tropical Storm Nicholas ===
{{storm pics|Nicholas satellite image and storm track.|Tropical Storm Nicholas (2003).jpg|Nicholas 2003 track.png}}

Tropical Storm Nicholas formed on [[October 14]] in the southern Atlantic. Due to continual wind shear, Nicholas would never undergo significant strengthening. Nicholas slowly travelled northwest, and became extratropical on [[October 23]].

The extratropical low that was Nicholas performed two anticyclonic loops while continuing to move westward, and was finally absorbed into a non-tropical low on [[November 1]]. There are no fatalities or damages associated with Tropical Storm Nicholas.
{{clear}}

=== Tropical Storm Odette ===
{{storm pics|Odette satellite image and storm track.|Tropical Storm Odette.jpg|Odette 2003 track.png}}

Odette was a rare December tropical storm (the first since [[Hurricane Lili (1984)|Hurricane Lili]] in 1984) that formed on [[December 4]], days after the official end of hurricane season. Odette strengthened and made landfall near [[Cabo Falso]] in the Dominican Republic on [[December 6]] as a moderately strong tropical storm. A day later, Odette became extratropical, and eventually merged with a cold front.

Eight deaths were directly attributed to this tropical storm in the [[Dominican Republic]] due to mudslides or flash flooding. In addition, two deaths were indirectly caused by the storm. Approximately 35% of the nation's [[banana]] crop was destroyed. Fortunately, little damage occurred in [[Haiti]].
{{clear}}

=== Tropical Storm Peter ===
{{storm pics|Peter satellite image and storm track.|Tropical Storm Peter (2003).jpg|Peter 2003 track.png}}

Peter was a short-lived storm, primarily notable for being the second December storm of the season, the first time this has occurred since the [[1887 Atlantic hurricane season|1887 season]]. It is also notable for being only the second storm to reach the 'P' name since naming began in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] in [[1950]], and one of only three storms total to do this. The other storms were [[1995 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm Pablo|Pablo]] in the [[1995 Atlantic hurricane season|1995 season]] and [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Philippe|Philippe]] in the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005 season]].

Peter formed as a subtropical storm on [[December 7]] from an extratropical gale. By [[December 9]], Peter had become a strong tropical storm, nearly reaching hurricane strength. The organization would not last, and Peter became an extratropical low on [[December 11]] and was absorbed by a cold front. No deaths or damages are associated with Peter. The formation of Peter made 2003 the busiest season since [[1995 Atlantic hurricane season|1995]].

The table on the right shows the [[Accumulated Cyclone Energy|ACE]] for each storm in the season. The ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed for, so hurricanes that lasted a long time (such as [[Hurricane Isabel|Isabel]] and [[Hurricane Fabian|Fabian]]) have higher ACEs. Isabel was one of the very few hurricanes since 1950 to have an ACE of over 50 10<sup>4</sup> kt<sup>2</sup>.
