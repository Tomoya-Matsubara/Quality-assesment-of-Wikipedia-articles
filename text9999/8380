'''Manuel De Landa''' (born 1952), is a [[Mexico|Mexican]]-[[United States|American]] writer, artist and philosopher who has lived in [[New York, New York|New York]] since 1975. He is the [[Gilles Deleuze]] Chair of Contemporary Philosophy and Science at the [[European Graduate School]] in [[Saas-Fee]], [[Switzerland]]{{dubious|date=February 2013}}; a visiting professor at the [[University of Southern California]] School of Architecture in [[Los Angeles]];{{cn|date=April 2012}} a lecturer at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] School of Design in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]; and an adjunct professor at the [[Pratt Institute]] School of Architecture in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]].<ref>See: [http://www.egs.edu/faculty/manuel-de-landa/biography/ Manuel de Landa] Faculty profile at [[European Graduate School]]</ref> He was previously an adjunct professor in the [[Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation]] at [[Columbia University]] and a lecturer at [[Canisius College]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]. De Landa has a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] from New York's [[School of Visual Arts]].

He is the author of ''[[War in the Age of Intelligent Machines]]'' (1991), ''[[A Thousand Years of Nonlinear History]]'' (1997), ''[[Intensive Science and Virtual Philosophy]]'' (2002) and
''[[A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity]]'' (2006). He has published many articles and essays and lectured extensively in Europe and in the United States. His work focuses on the theories of the French philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] on one hand, and modern [[science]], self-organizing matter, [[artificial life]] and [[artificial intelligence|intelligence]], [[economics]], [[architecture]], [[chaos theory]], [[history of science]], [[nonlinear dynamics]], [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]] on the other.

Alongside his intellectual work, De Landa made several short [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]] and 16mm films in the 1970s and early 1980s. He pulled them from circulation after the original negatives were lost. In 2011, [[Anthology Film Archives]] restored and reissued them. Cited by filmmaker [[Nick Zedd]] in his [[Cinema of Transgression]] Manifesto, De Landa associated with many of the experimental and art filmmakers of this New York based movement. Much of De Landa's film work is inspired by his interest in philosophy and critical theory; one of his best known films, ''Raw Nerves'', has been described as a '[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]ian thriller' by at least one critic.

His latest book (as of March 2011) is ''Philosophy and Simulation: The Emergence of Synthetic Reason'', which explores simulations of emergence in systems of different scales, from the atomic to the social.
