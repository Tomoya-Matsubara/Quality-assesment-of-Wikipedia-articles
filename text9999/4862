In [[enzymology]], an '''acyl-CoA hydrolase''' ({{EC number|3.1.2.20}}) is an [[enzyme]] that [[catalysis|catalyzes]] the [[chemical reaction]]

:acyl-CoA + H<sub>2</sub>O <math>\rightleftharpoons</math> CoA + a carboxylate

Thus, the two [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] of this enzyme are [[acyl-CoA]] and [[water|H<sub>2</sub>O]], whereas its two [[product (chemistry)|products]] are [[coenzyme A|CoA]] and [[carboxylate]].

This enzyme belongs to the family of [[hydrolase]]s, specifically those acting on [[thioester]] bonds.  The systematic name of this enzyme class is '''acyl-CoA hydrolase'''. Other names in common use include '''acyl coenzyme A thioesterase''', '''acyl-CoA thioesterase''', '''acyl coenzyme A hydrolase''', '''thioesterase B''', '''thioesterase II''', and '''acyl-CoA thioesterase'''.  

==Structural studies==

As of late 2007, two [[tertiary structure|structures]] have been solved for this class of enzymes, with [[Protein Data Bank|PDB]] accession codes {{PDB link|1Y7U}} and {{PDB link|2GVH}}.
