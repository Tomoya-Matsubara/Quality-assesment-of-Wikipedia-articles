'''Jesse Lee Reno''' ([[April 20]], [[1823]] &ndash; [[September 14]], [[1862]]) was a [[Union Army|Union]] [[general]] during the [[American Civil War]], killed at the [[Battle of South Mountain]].

==Early life==

Reno was born in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]], [[West Virginia|Virginia (present day West Virginia)]], the third oldest of eight children of Lewis Thomas and Rebecca (Quinby) Reno. His ancestors, who came from France in 1770, changed the spelling of their surname 'Renault' to the simpler 'Reno' when they arrived in America.<ref>[http://www.paulmartinart.com/GenJesseReno.html Remembering Reno]</ref>  His family moved to the [[Franklin, Pennsylvania]], area in 1830, and Reno spent his childhood there. 

Reno was admitted to the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1842 and graduated eighth in his class of 59 cadets in 1846, initially commissioned a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] [[second lieutenant]] of [[Ordnance]].<ref name=Eicher>Eicher, p. 449.</ref> Reno and [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson]] became close friends while at West Point. Other classmates and friends included [[George B. McClellan]], [[George Pickett]], [[Darius N. Couch]], [[A.P. Hill]], and [[George Stoneman]].

==Mexican-American War==

During the [[Mexican-American War]] in 1847, Reno commanded an [[artillery battery]] under General [[Winfield Scott]] and fought in the [[Siege of Vera Cruz]] and other battles in Mexico. Reno was brevetted twice during the war&mdash;once for "gallant and meritorious conduct" at the [[Battle of Cerro Gordo]], and later for bravery at the [[Battle for Mexico City]] and the [[Battle of Chapultepec]], where he was seriously wounded while commanding a howitzer battery.<ref>[http://www.famousamericans.net/jesseleereno FamousAmericans.net biography of Reno]</ref><ref>[http://www.wvculture.org/history/civilwar/renojesse01.html West Virginia Division of Culture & History]</ref>

After the Mexican-American War ended, Reno served in several locations, including as a [[mathematics]] instructor at West Point, as the secretary of a group assigned to "create a system of instruction for heavy artillery,<ref> [http://aotw.org/officers.php?officer_id=108 Antietam on the Web]</ref> and at the [[Ordnance Corps|Ordnance Board]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] He was promoted to [[first lieutenant]], in 1853, and sent to conduct a road survey from the [[Big Sioux River]] to [[Mendota, Minnesota]]. When he returned to Washington, he married Mary Blanes Cross, and the couple would go on to have five children. 

Reno's next assignment was as ordnance officer at the [[Frankford Arsenal]], northeast of [[Philadelphia]], where he spent the next few years. In 1857, Reno was assigned to go with [[brigadier general|Brig. Gen.]] [[Albert Sydney Johnston]] as chief of ordnance on a two-year expedition to the [[Utah Territory]].<ref>[http://www.wvculture.org/history/civilwar/renojesse01.html West Virginia Division of Culture & History]</ref>

==The Civil War starts early==

When he returned from Utah in 1859, Reno was promoted to captain for fourteen years of continuous service.<ref>[http://www.famousamericans.net/jesseleereno FamousAmericans.net biography of Reno]</ref> Captain Reno then took command of the [[Mount Vernon Arsenal]] near [[Mount Vernon, Alabama]], in 1859. At dawn on [[January 4]], [[1861]], Reno was forced to surrender the arsenal to troops from Alabama, a bloodless transfer ordered by the governor of Alabama, [[Andrew B. Moore]].<ref> War of the Rebellion, Vol. 1, Chap. III, p.318.</ref> Alabama seceded from the Union a week later.  

Upon leaving Alabama with his small force, Reno was temporarily assigned to command the [[Fort Leavenworth]] Arsenal until he was appointed [[brigadier general]] of volunteers in the fall of 1861. He transferred to Virginia, took command of the 2nd Brigade, [[IX Corps (ACW)|IX Corps]], and soon had organized five regiments. The 2nd Brigade fought in [[major general|Maj. Gen.]] [[Ambrose Burnside]]'s [[North Carolina Expedition]] from February through July of 1862. Reno became a division commander in the IX Corps,<ref name=Eicher /> which had become part of the [[Army of the Potomac]]. In the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]], Reno actively opposed his friend and classmate [[Stonewall Jackson]] during the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] and the [[Battle of Chantilly]]. Burnside became commander of the Army of the Potomac's Right Wing for the start of the [[Maryland Campaign]] in September, elevating Reno to command of the IX Corps from [[September 3]].<ref name=Eicher /> 

Reno had a reputation as a "soldier's soldier" and often was right beside his troops without a sword or any sign of rank.<ref> [http://www.cmhl.org/reno.html Central Maryland Heritage League Land Trust]</ref> On [[September 12]], [[1862]], Reno's IX Corps spent the day in [[Frederick, Maryland]]. Two days later, while he was stopped directly in front of his troops as he reconnoitered the enemy's forces at Fox's Gap at the [[Battle of South Mountain]], Reno was hit in the chest and mortally wounded; he died in the early evening of the same day. It remains uncertain if he was killed by [[friendly fire]] or by the Confederates. In his official report, [[D. H. Hill]] sarcastically remarked, "The Yankees on their side lost General Reno, a renegade Virginian, who was killed by a happy shot from the Twenty-third North Carolina."<ref>[[Official Records of the American Civil War|Official Records]], Series 1, Volume XIX, Chapter XXI, p. 1020.</ref>

Reno was posthumously promoted to [[major general]], effective [[July 12]], [[1862]].

==In memoriam==

Reno was buried in [[Oak Hill Cemetery]] in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.]]. A memorial marking the location of his death was erected in 1889 by IX Corps veterans on present-day Reno Monument Road.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/anti/monuments/Reno.htm Antietam Battlefield Monuments]</ref>

The [[United States Army]] named three outposts after Reno: Fort Pennsylvania in present-day [[Washington, D.C.]], was renamed Fort Reno in 1862, and the second [[Fort Reno (Oklahoma)|Fort Reno]] was constructed near present-day [[El Reno, Oklahoma]], in 1874,  the third [[Fort Reno (Wyoming)|Fort Reno]] was built in present-day [[Wyoming]] on the [[Bozeman Trail]] in 1865. [[Reno, Nevada]], [[Reno, Pennsylvania]], and [[Reno County, Kansas]], are also named in his honor.
