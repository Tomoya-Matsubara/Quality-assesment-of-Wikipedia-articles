'''Ernst Julius Berg''' was born in Osterlund, [[Sweden]] on 9 Feb. [[1871]]. 
He was an electrical engineer, who began working as an assistant to [[Charles Proteus Steinmetz]] at [[General Electric]]. He then joined the faculty of Electrical Engineering at [[Union College]]. 
In [[1906]] he married Gwendoline O'Brien. In [[1909]], he became head of electrical engineering department 
at the [[University of Illinois]]. He return to Union College in [[1913]], where he became Dean of Engineering, till his death in [[1941]].   
A pioneer of radio, he produced the first two-way radio voice program in the United States.
In the field of theoretical analysis of electrical circuits, he popularized [[Oliver Heaviside]]'s technique of [[operational calculus]]. 

Buried in [[Vale Cemetery]] in [[Schenectady, New York]].
