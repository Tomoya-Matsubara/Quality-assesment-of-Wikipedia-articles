'''Julian Morton Carroll''' (born April 16, 1931) is a politician from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Kentucky]]. A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he is presently a member of the [[Kentucky Senate]], representing [[Anderson County, Kentucky|Anderson]], [[Franklin County, Kentucky|Franklin]], [[Woodford County, Kentucky|Woodford]], and part of [[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette]] counties. From 1974 to 1979, he served as the [[List of Governors of Kentucky|54th]] [[Governor of Kentucky]], succeeding [[Wendell H. Ford]], who resigned to accept a seat in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. He was the first Kentucky governor from the state's far-western [[Jackson Purchase]] region, and his running mate [[Thelma Stovall]] was the first woman to be elected [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor of Kentucky]].

After graduating from the [[University of Kentucky]] and spending three years as an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] lawyer, Carroll returned to [[McCracken County, Kentucky]] where he gained acclaim for leading a campaign to allow the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] to provide low-cost electricity to the county. He was elected to the first of five terms in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] in 1962 and served as [[Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives|speaker]] of that body from 1968 to 1970. He ran for lieutenant governor in 1970 on an informal ticket with former governor [[Bert T. Combs]]. Combs lost in the [[Primary election|primary]] to Wendell Ford, but Carroll defeated his primary opponents and went on to win the general election. He was elevated to governor in 1975 due to Ford's election to the Senate, and won a full term in his own right in 1976.

As governor, Carroll increased funding for public education and promoted the use of coal as a means of alleviating the [[1973 energy crisis]]. He also oversaw a major reorganization of the state's judicial system. Many natural and man-made disasters occurred during his term in office, including the [[Great Blizzard of 1978]] and the [[Beverly Hills Supper Club fire]], leading to better safety practices and stricter law enforcement in the state. When Carroll left office, both he and his predecessor were under the cloud of an investigation for an alleged insurance [[Political_corruption#Kickbacks|kickback]] scheme, but Carroll was not convicted of any wrongdoing. In 2004, he was elected to the Kentucky Senate. His present term is set to expire in 2012.

==Early life==
Julian Carroll was born in [[West Paducah, Kentucky|West Paducah]], [[McCracken County, Kentucky]] on April 16, 1931.<ref name=nga>"Kentucky Governor Julian Morton Carroll". National Governors Association</ref> He was the third of eleven children born to Elvie B. "Buster" and Eva (Heady) Carroll.<ref name=conn47>Conn, p. 47</ref> His father was a [[tenant farmer]], but shortly after the [[Ohio River flood of 1937]], the family moved to [[Heath, Kentucky]] where Buster Carroll sold tractor implements and opened a [[automobile repair shop]] in 1940.<ref name=conn47 /> Through his early teenage years, Carroll lived with his grandparents to help care for an ailing grandfather.<ref name=conn50>Conn, p. 50</ref>

In 1949, Carroll was selected to represent [[Heath High School (Kentucky)|Heath High School]] at Kentucky [[Boys/Girls State|Boys State]], a week-long a civic affairs summer camp for high school seniors-to-be.<ref name=conn59>Conn, p. 59</ref> Participants in the camp create a miniature state government based on their state's actual government.<ref name=conn59 /> At the camp, Carroll was elected governor of the miniature government.<ref name=conn62>Conn, p. 62</ref> The following year, he graduated as [[salutatorian]] and student body president of Heath High School.<ref name=ukaa>"Julian Morton Carroll". Hall of Distinguished Alumni</ref>

Carroll began dating Charlann Harting near the end of 1950.<ref name=conn66>Conn, p. 66</ref> In mid-1951, they parted ways to attend college &ndash; Harting, whose family was better off financially, at the [[University of Kentucky]] and Carroll at nearby [[West Kentucky Community and Technical College|Paducah Junior College]].<ref name=conn66 /> After their first year, Carroll and Harting decided to get married.<ref name=conn67>Conn, p. 67</ref> The ceremony took place on July 22, 1951, and the couple eventually had four children &ndash; Kenneth, Patrice, Bradley, and Ellyn.<ref name=powell112>Powell, p. 112</ref> Ellyn, born June 27, 1975, was the first child born to a Kentucky [[First Family]] while they were residing in the [[Kentucky Governor's Mansion|Governor's Mansion]].<ref name=powell112 />

Carroll earned an [[Associate in Arts]] degree from Paducah Junior College in 1952.<ref name=kye165>Harrison in ''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'', p. 165</ref> That summer, the family moved to [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] where Carroll matriculated to the University of Kentucky.<ref name=conn78>Conn, p. 78</ref> He funded his further education working for the Fayette County [[Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service|Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Office]].<ref name=ukaa /> In 1954, he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[political science]], and in 1956, he earned a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree.<ref name=ukaa /> 

While in college, Carroll had received training through the [[Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps]].<ref name=conn83>Conn, p. 83</ref> By graduation, he had risen to the rank of Commandant of Cadets, the highest rank of any student at the university.<ref name=conn83 /> After graduation, he enlisted in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] and was stationed at [[Carswell Air Force Base]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].<ref name=sprague217>Sprague, p. 217</ref> For three years, he served as an Air Force attorney, then returned to Paducah and joined the law firm of Reed, Scent, Reed, and Walton.<ref name=kye165 /><ref name=sprague217 /> He was active in civic affairs, including membership in the [[Jaycees]] and serving as charter president of the Paducah [[Optimist International|Optimists Club]] in 1962.<ref name=ukaa /> He was a frequent lay speaker in the [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church]], and from 1966 to 1967, served as moderator for the [[Kentucky Synod]].<ref name=kye165 />

In January 1960, a group of local businessmen approached Carroll about leading a campaign to allow the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) to provide electricity to McCracken County. TVA could provide electricity at a much lower cost, but voters would first have to hold a public referendum on buying out [[Kentucky Utilities]], the private power provider in the area. Carroll agreed to lead the campaign, and nine months later, voters approved the buyout by a three-to-one margin.<ref>Conn, pp. 90&ndash;91</ref>

==Political career==
The TVA campaign had put Carroll squarely in the public eye in McCracken County, and in 1962, he was elected to the first of five consecutive terms representing the county in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]]. He was chosen [[Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] from 1968 through 1970. In the 100-member House of Representatives, it was not uncommon for [[lobbyist]]s to roam the floor freely, for members to bring their lunches to their desks, or for them to bring their friends and family members onto the floor during debate. Determined to bring a higher degree of decorum to the chamber's proceedings, Carroll opened the 1968 legislative session with a single, powerful whack of his gavel. The gavel shattered, stunning the legislators. Carroll subsequently barred outsiders from the floor during debate and forbade eating in the chamber. Carroll shattered three more gavels during the legislative session &ndash; he was finally given a sturdier one made of solid oak and [[formica]] &ndash; but he brought order to the chamber's proceedings. At the end of the session, a member of the opposing party declared from the floor "The decorum of this House has improved 100 percent... I must compliment the present Speaker of this House for ... eliminating the abominable practices. Today every member has a right to speak ... without fear of interruption and catcalls or being shouted down."<ref name=conn101>Conn, p. 101</ref> The legislator's compliment was followed by a [[standing ovation]] for Carroll.<ref>Conn, pp. 98&ndash;101</ref> 

Carroll had considered running for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in 1968, but dropped out of the race after just two weeks when he discovered that it would take well over $100,000 to run a competitive [[primary election|primary]] campaign.<ref name=conn103>Conn, p. 103</ref> In 1971, former governor [[Bert T. Combs]] sought a second term as governor and chose Carroll as his informal running mate.<ref name=sprague217 /> (The governor and [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]] were elected separately at the time.) Combs, an [[Eastern Kentucky]] native, sought geographic balance for the ticket by selecting Carroll, from the far-west [[Jackson Purchase]].<ref name=kye165 /> Combs said he would provide the needed financing, and Carroll agreed to enter the race.<ref name=conn104>Conn, p. 104</ref>

Seven other Democratic candidates for lieutenant governor entered the race, the most formidable being sitting [[Attorney General of Kentucky|attorney general]] [[John B. Breckinridge]].<ref>Conn, pp. 104&ndash;105</ref> While Combs lost to Ford in the gubernatorial primary, Carroll won the separate primary for lieutenant governor, partly on the strength of the eastern Kentucky votes he gained from his association with Combs.<ref name=sprague217 /> Carroll went on to defeat [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Jim Host in the general election for lieutenant governor.<ref name=sprague217 /> As lieutenant governor, Carroll chaired the [[Legislative Research Commission]] and the [[National Conference of Lieutenant Governors]].<ref name=nga />

===Governor of Kentucky===
[[File:Wendell Ford.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A black-and-white portrait of a man in his fifties wearing a suit|Wendell Ford's election to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in 1974 elevated Carroll to governor]]
Governor Ford's allies encouraged Carroll to run for the U.S. Senate in 1974, but Carroll had already set his sights on the governorship.<ref name=sprague217 /> Instead, Ford ran for and won the Senate seat, and Carroll succeeded him as governor.<ref name=nga /> In 1975, he sought a full term in office and won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in a four-way primary against Todd Hollenbach, Mary Louise Foust, and Robert McCreary Johnson.<ref name=powell112 /> 

In the general election, Carroll faced Republican [[Robert E. Gable]], a coal company owner from central Kentucky.<ref name=conn112>Conn, p. 112</ref> The main issue of the campaign was the imposition of [[Desegregation busing in the United States|desegregation busing]] on the city of [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]].<ref name=conn112 /> Both candidates opposed the busing, but Gable did so more vehemently and criticized the sitting governor for not "doing something about it".<ref name=conn112 /> In a televised debate with Carroll, Gable insisted on using what he called a "truth bell".<ref>Conn, pp. 112&ndash;113</ref> Gable rang the bell every time that he perceived that Carroll was not telling the truth.<ref name=conn113>Conn, p. 113</ref> Eventually, the moderator of the debate ordered Gable to put the bell away, and Gable's credibility suffered in the eyes of voters.<ref name=conn113 /> Carroll won the general election by a vote of 470,159 to 277,998, representing a record margin of victory in the Kentucky governor's race.<ref name=nhok416>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 416</ref> He carried every congressional district including [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]], where a Democrat had not won a race in twenty years.<ref name=conn19>Conn, p. 19</ref> His running mate, [[Thelma Stovall]], became the first woman elected lieutenant governor of Kentucky.<ref name=powell112 />

With considerable experience in the [[Kentucky General Assembly|General Assembly]] &ndash; first as Speaker of the House, and later presiding over the Kentucky Senate as lieutenant governor &ndash; Carroll exercised a great deal of control over the proceedings of the legislature.<ref name=nhok416 /> One observer quipped "A cockroach couldn't crawl across the Senate floor without an OK from the governor stamped on his back."<ref name=nhok416 /> His reaction to criticism was often severe, prompting his political enemies to derisively refer to him as Emperor Julian.<ref name=nhok416 /> During the final year of Carroll's term, Lieutenant Governor Stovall, who was left as acting governor when Carroll had left the state on business, called a special session of the legislature to enact a tax cut that Carroll opposed.<ref name=kye165 /> The General Assembly passed the tax cut, partly in retaliation for the governor's tight control of previous sessions.<ref name=sprague220>Sprague, p. 220</ref>

Carroll was charged with implementing an amendment to the state constitution approved by voters in 1975 to drastically reorganize the state's judicial system.<ref name=nhok416 /> The [[Kentucky Court of Appeals]], the state's [[court of last resort]], was renamed the [[Kentucky Supreme Court]], and a new Court of Appeals was created and interposed between the Supreme Court and the state's circuit and district courts.<ref name=nhok416 /> The position of [[county judge]] was made a purely administrative position, and the office was renamed [[County Judge/Executive|county judge/executive]].<ref name=nhok416 /> Historian [[Lowell H. Harrison]] opined that the amendment made Kentucky's legal system "a model for the nation."<ref name=nhok416 />

Improvements in public schools were the hallmark of Carroll's term.<ref name=kye165 /> Using money from a coal [[severance tax]] enacted by Ford's administration and increased revenue from an improving economy, Carroll increased teacher salaries and eliminated fees for required classes.<ref name=sprague218>Sprague, p. 218</ref> He strengthened the state's Minimum Foundation Program and provided free textbooks.<ref name=kye165 /> A School Building Authority was also created to help poor school districts construct new buildings.<ref name=sprague218 /> Vocational and [[Special education in the United States|special education]] were expanded under the Carroll administration, and a program for gifted and talented students was piloted.<ref name=sprague218 /> Consequently, Kentucky improved in most national educational benchmarks, including moving from forty-sixth to thirty-eighth nationally in teacher salaries.<ref name=kye165 /> 

Higher education did not fare as well under Carroll. He cut the proposed budget for the state's [[Council on Postsecondary Education|Council on Higher Education]] by 40 percent.<ref name=sprague218 /> Because of the considerable political clout of the [[Golden Triangle (Kentucky)|Golden Triangle]] ([[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] and [[Covington, Kentucky|Covington]]), the University of Kentucky, [[University of Louisville]], and [[Northern Kentucky University]] were spared the more severe budget cuts imposed on the state's regional universities.<ref name=sprague218 />

As governor of the leading coal-producing state in the nation, Carroll advocated the use of coal to alleviate the [[1973 energy crisis]].<ref name=sprague219>Sprague, p. 219</ref> He was called to testify before several congressional committees and served as an energy adviser to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]].<ref name=sprague219 /> At the state level, he created a department of energy and constructed "resource recovery roads" in the state's coalfield regions.<ref name=sprague219 /> Among Carroll's other accomplishments were the initiation of a grant program to support the arts and the expansion of the [[List of Kentucky state parks|state park system]].<ref name=kye165 /><ref name=sprague219 /> He was one of many who opposed the damming of the [[Red River (Kentucky)|Red River]], which would have flooded [[Red River Gorge]].<ref name=sprague219 /> Carroll was a supporter of a [[lemon law]] (that sought to provide a remedy for purchasers of cars that failed to meet quality standards) that was defeated in the 1976 legislative session.<ref name=sprague219 />

Carroll served as chairman of the [[National Governors Association]] in 1978.<ref name=nga /> He chaired the Association's Natural Resources and Environmental Management Committee and served on its Technology Committee.<ref name=ukaa /> He also served as the state's co-chairman of the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]].<ref name=powell112 /> He received [[honorary degree]]s from the University of Kentucky, [[Morehead State University]], [[Murray State University]], and [[Eastern Kentucky University]] in Kentucky, and from [[Lincoln Memorial University]] in [[Harrogate, Tennessee]].<ref name=ukaa /> He was named to the University of Kentucky Alumni Association's Hall of Distinguished Alumni in 1975.<ref name=ukaa />

Carroll's tenure was plagued by disasters, both natural and man-made. Flooding struck in the eastern part of the state and in the state capitol of [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]].<ref name=sprague219 /> Extreme cold gripped the entire state in 1977 and 1978, including the [[Great Blizzard of 1978]].<ref name=sprague219 /> Two mine explosions in [[Letcher County, Kentucky|Letcher County]] killed 26 people, and the [[Beverly Hills Supper Club fire]] claimed 165 lives.<ref name=sprague219 /> Many of these disasters led to stricter enforcement of safety laws.<ref name=sprague219 /> Carroll formed the Department of Housing, Buildings, and Construction and strengthened the state [[fire marshal]]'s office.<ref name=sprague219 />

Carroll's credibility took a severe hit as a result of an investigation into an alleged insurance [[Political_corruption#Kickbacks|kickback]] scheme during the Ford administration and carrying on into his administration.<ref name=sprague220 /> When called before a [[grand jury]] in 1980, Carroll invoked the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].<ref name=sprague220 /> He was not convicted of any wrongdoing, but his first state Democratic Party chairman, Howard P. "Sonny" Hunt, was.<ref name=sprague220 /> The investigation also hurt commerce commissioner Terry McBrayer, Carroll's choice for governor in 1979.<ref name=sprague220 /> McBrayer finished third out of five candidates in the Democratic primary that year.<ref name=sprague220 />

===Later political career===
After concluding his service as governor, Carroll resumed his law practice in [[Frankfort, Kentucky]].<ref name=kye165 /> Governor [[John Y. Brown, Jr.]] made him chairman of a non-profit organization to fight drugs in 1983.<ref name=sprague220 /> In 1987, he unsuccessfully sought another term as governor, finishing fifth in the Democratic primary behind Lieutenant Governor [[Steve Beshear]], former governor John Y. Brown, Jr., [[Grady Stumbo]], and the winner, [[Wallace G. Wilkinson]].<ref name=nhok420>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 420</ref> Carroll again returned to his Frankfort law practice. In 2001, Kentucky's Purchase Parkway was renamed the [[Julian M. Carroll Purchase Parkway]].<ref name=kocher>Kocher, p. A1</ref> In 2003, Carroll actively lobbied the General Assembly to legalize casino-style gambling at the state's horse racetracks.<ref name=sprague220 />

In 2004, Carroll was elected to the Kentucky Senate from District 7, defeating Harold Fletcher &ndash; the older brother of then-governor [[Ernie Fletcher]] &ndash; by a wide margin.<ref name=biesk>Biesk, "Ex-Gov. Carroll wins Frankfort seat"</ref> The district includes all or portions of [[Anderson County, Kentucky|Anderson]], [[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette]], [[Franklin County, Kentucky|Franklin]], and [[Woodford County, Kentucky|Woodford]] counties.<ref>[http://www.lrc.ky.gov/Legislator/S007.htm Kentucky Senate Web Page]</ref> He made headlines in 2007 when he called on Fletcher's lieutenant governor, [[Steve Pence]], to resign for his disloyalty after Pence endorsed [[Anne Northup]] in the Republican gubernatorial primary rather than backing Fletcher's re-election bid.<ref name=wkyt>"Senator Julian Carroll Says Lieutenant Governor Should Resign". WKYT</ref> Pence refused to resign, citing an investigation of the administration's hiring practices as his reason for refusing to endorse Fletcher.<ref name=wkyt /> Fletcher won the Republican primary, but lost in the [[Kentucky gubernatorial election, 2007|general election]] to Democrat [[Steve Beshear]].

Carroll's present senate term will expire in 2012.
