{{redirect|Yen}}
:''YEN redirects here.  For the airport with the same [[IATA airport code]], see [[Estevan Airport]].''

The '''yen''' or '''en''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: <U+5186>) is the [[currency]] of [[Japan]]. It is also widely used as a [[reserve currency]] after the [[United States dollar]] and [[euro]]. The [[ISO 4217]] codes for the yen are JPY and 392. The [[Latin alphabet|Latin]]ised [[symbol]] is <U+00A5>, while in Japanese it is written with the [[kanji]] {{Unicode|<U+5186>}}.

==Etymology==
In standard [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the yen is actually pronounced "en", but the spelling "yen" is standard in [[English language|English]], due to historical [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] [[transliteration]].  The yen is a [[cognate]] of the Chinese [[Renminbi|yuan]] and the Korean [[South Korean won|won]], and was originally written in the same way in [[Kanji]] as the Chinese yuan (<U+5713> [[pinyin]]: yu<U+00E1>n, [[Wade-Giles]]: yuen). Modern Japanese writings now use the simplified [[shinjitai]] character (<U+5186>) which is different from the one commonly used (as shorthand) in Chinese (<U+5143>).  The Latinized symbol (<U+00A5>) for the yen however, is identical to the one for the Chinese [[Renminbi|yuan]], although the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] also uses the single-crossbar Y (<U+04B0>).  Consequently, the ISO abbreviations JPY for the yen and CNY for the yuan are used to avoid confusion of the two currencies. 

En literally means "round object" in Japanese, as yuan does in Chinese, referring to the ancient Chinese coins that were circular in shape and widely used in Japan up to the [[Tokugawa Period]]. The spelling and pronunciation with the letter ''y'' are based on [[romanization]] of an obsolete writing of the word. The same combination occurs in words such as ''[[Ueda, Nagano|Uyeda]]'', ''[[Yebisu]]'', ''[[Tokugawa Ieyasu|Iyeyasu]]'', ''[[Inoue|Inouye]]'' and ''[[Edo|Yedo]]''. Like the spellings of names of people outside Japan, the romanization of ''yen'' has become a permanent feature.

==History==
The yen was introduced by the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] government in 1870 as a system resembling those in [[Europe]]. The yen replaced the complex monetary system of the [[Edo period]], based on the [[Japanese mon|mon]]. The ''New Currency Act'' of [[1871]] stipulated the adoption of the decimal accounting system of yen (1, <U+5713>), sen ({{Fraction|1|100||}}, <U+9322>), and rin ({{Fraction|1|1000}}, <U+5398>), with the coins being round and cast as in the West. The yen was legally defined as 0.78 [[Troy weight|troy ounces]] (24.26 g) of pure silver, or 1.5 grams of pure gold. The same amount of silver is worth about 1181 today's yen,<ref>{{cite web | author=xe.com | date=[[2006-09-07]] | url=http://www.xe.com/ucc/convert.cgi?Amount=0.78&From=XAG&To=JPY | title=Equivalent of 0.78 troy ounce of silver in yen | accessdate=2006-09-07}}</ref> while the same amount of gold is worth about 3572 yen.<ref>{{cite web | author=xe.com | date=[[2006-09-07]] | url=http://www.xe.com/ucc/convert.cgi?Amount=0.04822612&From=XAU&To=JPY | title=Equivalent of 0.04822612 troy ounce of gold in yen | accessdate=2006-09-07}}</ref> The Act also moved Japan onto the [[gold standard]]. (The sen and the rin were eventually taken out of circulation in [[1954]].) While not a usage specific to currency, large quantities of yen are often counted in multiples of 10,000 (''man'', <U+4E07>) in the same way as values in the [[United States]] are often quoted or rounded off to hundreds or thousands.  

The yen lost most of its value during and after [[World War II]]; after a period of instability, the yen was pegged at 1 [[US dollar]] = <U+00A5>360 from [[April 25]], [[1949]], to until [[1971]] when the [[Bretton Woods system]] collapsed and the value of the yen began to float. After the [[Plaza Accord]] of [[1985]], the yen appreciated against the dollar.

[[Image:JuEnDamaByodoinWP.jpg|thumb|Japanese 10 yen coin ([[obverse]]) showing Phoenix Hall of [[By<U+014D>d<U+014D>-in]]]]

The 5-yen and 50-yen coins are holed.  The date is on the reverse of all coins, and, in most cases, the name <U+65E5><U+672C><U+56FD>, Nihonkoku (Japan) and the value in kanji is on the obverse, except for the 5-yen where Nihonkoku is on the reverse.

The first 1-yen coin (excluding early silver coins) was a brass coin introduced in [[1948]], and discontinued in [[1950]], the first 5-yen coin (excluding early gold coins) in [[1948]], and originally had no hole.  The first 10-yen was introduced in [[1951]], the first 50-yen in [[1955]] (with no hole), the first 100-yen in [[1957]] (originally made out of silver).  The 500-yen coin was introduced in [[1982]]. <ref>{{cite web | author=Japan Mint | date=[[2006-09-07]] | url=http://www.mint.go.jp/eng/data/page01-1_e.html | title=Number of Coin Production (calendar year) | accessdate=2006-09-07}}</ref>

500 yen coins are probably the highest valued coins to be used regularly in the world (with rates in the neighborhood of US$4.77, <U+20AC>3.59, and <U+00A3>2.49).  The United States' largest-valued commonly-used coin (25<U+00A2>) is worth around 26 yen; the [[Eurozone]]'s largest (<U+20AC>2) is worth <U+00A5>279, and the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom's]] largest (<U+00A3>2) is worth <U+00A5>402 (as of March 2005).  The Swiss 5-franc coin is currently (as of May 2006) worth about <U+00A5>457. The highest valued bill, the 10,000 yen bill, is worth just a little bit less than the U.S. $100 bill, the highest denomination of currently circulating U.S. currency.

No doubt because of this high face value, the 500 yen has been a favorite target for counterfeiters.  It was counterfeited to such an extent that in 2000, the existing 500 yen coins were withdrawn from circulation and a new series issued with various security features.  Counterfeiting continues.

On various occasions, commemorative coins are minted using gold and silver with various face values, up to 100,000 yen.<ref>{{cite web | author=Japan Mint | date=[[2006-09-07]] | url=http://www.mint.go.jp/eng/data/page02_e.html | title=Commemorative Coins issued up to now | accessdate=2006-09-07}}</ref> Even though they can be used, they are treated as collectibles.

Instead of displaying the [[A.D.]] year of mintage like most coins, yen coins instead display [[Japanese era name|the year of the current emperor's reign]]. For example, a coin minted in 2006 would bear the date [[Akihito|Heisei]] 18 (the 18th year of the Heisei Emperor's reign).

Due to the discovery of a large number of counterfeit Series D banknotes at the end of [[2004]], all Series D banknotes except <U+00A5>2000 were virtually suspended on [[January 17]], [[2005]] [http://www.boj.or.jp/type/release/zuiji/bnnew16.htm]. However, a cabinet ordinance of this suspension has not yet been declared. According to a news release [http://www.npa.go.jp/toukei/souni/gizou.htm] from the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]], they seized 11,717 counterfeit Series D banknotes (excluding the <U+00A5>2000 denomination) in [[2005]]. However, they seized only 486 counterfeit current issue banknotes, namely Series E <U+00A5>1000, <U+00A5>5000, <U+00A5>10000, and Series D <U+00A5>2000.

The 2,000 yen note was first issued on [[July 19]], [[2000]] to commemorate the [[G8]] Economic Summit in [[Okinawa]] and the millennium year as well. Pictured on the front of the note is Shureimon, a famous gate in [[Naha, Okinawa]] near the site of the summit.  These notes are hard to find and many Japanese consider it a novelty as it is the only denomination in the factor of 2 (from 1 and 5). Some say it was a way to stimulate the economy from building new vending machines to be able to process the note, to creating wider cash registers to handle the bill. {{fact}} This hasn't really materialised. Some businesses will refuse this note. To increase the circulation of the notes, some companies started paying wages in these notes.

==Determinants of value==
===Economic forces of supply and demand===
The [[relative value]] of the yen is determined in [[foreign exchange market]]s by the [[Economics|economic forces]] of [[supply and demand]]. The [[Supply|supply]] of the yen in the [[market]] is governed by the desire of yen holders to exchange their yen for other currencies to purchase [[goods]], [[services]], or [[asset]]s. The [[Demand|demand]] for the yen is governed by the desire of foreigners to buy goods and services in Japan and by their interest in [[investing]] in Japan (buying yen-denominated real and financial assets).

===Fixed value of the yen to the dollar===
In [[1949]] the [[Fixed exchange rate|value of the yen was fixed]] at <U+00A5>360 per [[United States|US]][[United States dollar|$1]] through a United States plan, which was part of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods System]], to stabilize prices in the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese economy]]. That [[exchange rate]] was maintained until [[1971]], when the United States abandoned the [[Gold standard|convertibility of the dollar to gold]], which had been a key element of the Bretton Woods System, and imposed a [[Import duty|10 percent surcharge]] on [[imports]], setting in motion changes that eventually led to [[Floating exchange rate|floating exchange rates]] in [[1973]].

===An undervalued yen===
By 1971 the yen had become undervalued. Japanese [[export]]s were costing too little in international markets, and imports from abroad were costing the Japanese too much. This undervaluation was reflected in the [[current account balance]], which had risen from the [[Trade deficit|deficits]] of the early [[1960s]] to a then-large [[Trade surplus|surplus]] of U.S. $5.8 billion in 1971. The belief that the yen, and several other major currencies, were undervalued motivated the United States' actions in 1971.

===The yen and major currencies float===
Following the United States' measures to devalue the dollar in the summer of 1971, the Japanese government agreed to a new, fixed exchange rate as part of the [[Smithsonian Agreement]], signed at the end of the year. This agreement set the exchange rate at <U+00A5>308 per US$1. However, the new fixed rates of the Smithsonian Agreement were difficult to maintain in the face of supply and demand pressures in the foreign-exchange market. In early 1973, the rates were abandoned, and the major nations of the world allowed their currencies to float.

===Japanese government intervention in the currency market===
In the [[1970s]], Japanese government and business people were very concerned that a rise in the value of the yen would hurt export growth by making Japanese products less competitive and would damage the industrial base. The government therefore continued to intervene heavily in foreign-exchange marketing (buying or selling dollars), even after the 1973 decision to allow the yen to float.

Despite intervention, market pressures caused the yen to continue climbing in value, peaking temporarily at an average of <U+00A5>271 per US$1 in [[1973]] before the impact of the [[1973 oil crisis]] was felt. The increased costs of imported [[Petroleum|oil]] caused the yen to depreciate to a range of <U+00A5>290 to <U+00A5>300 between [[1974]] and [[1976]]. The re-emergence of trade surpluses drove the yen back up to <U+00A5>211 in [[1978]]. This currency strengthening was again reversed by the [[1979 energy crisis|second oil shock in 1979]], with the yen dropping to <U+00A5>227 by [[1980]].

===The yen in the early 1980's===
During the first half of the [[1980s]], the yen failed to rise in value even though current account surpluses returned and grew quickly. From <U+00A5>221 in [[1981]], the average value of the yen actually dropped to <U+00A5>239 in [[1985]]. The rise in the current account surplus generated stronger demand for yen in foreign-exchange markets, but this trade-related demand for yen was offset by other factors. A wide differential in [[interest rates]], with United States interest rates much higher than those in Japan, and the continuing moves to [[Deregulation|deregulate]] the international flow of [[capital]], led to a large net outflow of capital from Japan. This capital flow increased the supply of yen in foreign-exchange markets, as Japanese investors changed their yen for other currencies (mainly dollars) to invest overseas. This kept the yen weak relative to the dollar and fostered the rapid rise in the Japanese trade surplus that took place in the 1980s.

===The effect of the Plaza Accord===
In [[1985]] a dramatic change began. Finance officials from major nations signed an agreement (the [[Plaza Accord]]) affirming that the dollar was overvalued (and, therefore, the yen undervalued). This agreement, and shifting supply and demand pressures in the markets, led to a rapid rise in the value of the yen. From its average of <U+00A5>239 per US$1 in 1985, the yen rose to a peak of <U+00A5>128 in [[1988]], virtually doubling its value relative to the dollar. After declining somewhat in [[1989]] and [[1990]], it reached a new high of <U+00A5>123 to US$1 in December [[1992]].

The yen's increased value made Japanese exports less price competitive and imports more price competitive, which should have brought down the value of trade and current account surpluses. The current account figures discussed earlier, however, indicated that such a response was slow. The strong appreciation of the yen began in 1985, but the current account continued to rise until [[1987]]. Its decline in 1988 was rather small, although it experienced a more substantial decline in 1989.
