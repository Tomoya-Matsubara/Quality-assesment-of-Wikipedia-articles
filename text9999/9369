The '''Gallox Bridge''' in [[Dunster]], [[Somerset]], England dates from the 15th century. It has been designated as a Grade I [[listed building]] and [[scheduled monument]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=264705|title=Gallox Bridge|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=13 April 2009}}</ref><ref name=nhlesched>{{cite web|title=Gallox Bridge: Scheduled Monument|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1014410|website=National Heritage List for England|publisher=Historic England|accessdate=21 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=nhlelisted>{{cite web|title=Gallox Bridge: Listed Building|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1296207|website=National Heritage List for England|publisher=Historic England|accessdate=21 January 2015}}</ref> The bridge is in the guardianship of [[English Heritage]].

The stone [[packhorse bridge]] crosses the [[River Avill]] at the southern end of the village, below [[Dunster Castle]] at a point which may have been the limit of tidal flow during the medieval period. It was important for the transport of wool and other goods to the market within the village which was established by 1222. The name is derived from the nearby [[gallows]]. The narrow bridge is approach via a raised causeway for pedestrians, while wheeled traffic uses the adjacent ford.

==History==
The bridge crosses the [[River Avill]] which rises on the eastern slopes of [[Dunkery Beacon]] and flows north through [[Timberscombe]] and [[Dunster]] flowing into the [[Bristol Channel]] at Dunster Beach. It is likely that there was a previous bridge on the same site as in the 14th century it was known as Doddebrigge.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Gallox Bridge|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/gallox-bridge/history/|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=27 April 2015}}</ref> The bridge may have been at the limit of the tidal mouth of the river during the medieval period.<ref name=gathercole/> Dunster Beach, which includes the mouth of the River Avill, is now located approximately {{convert|0.5|mi}} from the village, and used to have a significant harbour, known as Dunster Haven, which was used for the export of wool from [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] times; however, it was last used in the 17th century and has now disappeared among the dykes, meadows and marshes near the shore.<ref>{{cite book |title=Somerset Harbours |last=Farr |first=Grahame |year=1954 |publisher=Christopher Johnson |location=London |isbn= |pages=138<U+2013>140 }}</ref>

Dunster had become a centre for woollen and clothing production by the 13th century, with the market dating back to at least 1222, and a particular kind of kersey or broadcloth became known as 'Dunsters'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everythingexmoor.org.uk/encyclopedia_detail.php?ENCid=1133|title=Yarn Market Dunster |publisher=Everything Exmoor|accessdate=21 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=gathercole>{{cite web|url=http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/hes/downloads/Somerset_EUS_Dunster.pdf|format=PDF|title=Dunster|last=Gathercole|first=Clare|work=The Somerset Urban Archaeological Survey|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=6 June 2014}}</ref> The prosperity of Dunster was based on the wool trade, with profits helping to pay for the construction of the tower of the [[Priory Church of St George, Dunster|Priory Church of St George]] and provide other amenities.

The name Gallox is believed to be derived from gallows as the village [[gallows]] were nearby,<ref>{{cite web|title=Gallox Bridge|url=http://www.dunsterestate.co.uk/things-to-see-do/see-dunster-estate/gallox-bridge/|publisher=Crown Estate|accessdate=21 January 2015}}</ref> when it was called Gallocksbrigge.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carter|first1=Katy|title=Heritage Unlocked: Guide to free sites in Devon, Dorset and Somerset|date=2004|publisher=English Heritage|isbn=978-1850748755|pages=64-65}}</ref> The bridge is close to [[Dunster Working Watermill]] and the base of the hill on which [[Dunster Castle]] sits and povides access to the site of the [[Deer park (England)|Deer park]].
