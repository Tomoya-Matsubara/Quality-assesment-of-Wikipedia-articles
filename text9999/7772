The '''Red-winged Fairy-wren''' ('''''Malurus elegans''''') is a species of [[passerine]] [[bird]] in the [[Maluridae]] family. It is sedentary and [[Endemism|endemic]] to the southwestern corner of [[Western Australia]]. Exhibiting a high degree of [[sexual dimorphism]], the male adopts a brilliantly coloured breeding plumage, with an iridescent silvery-blue crown, ear coverts and upper back, red shoulders, contrasting with a black throat, grey-brown tail and wings and pale underparts. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles have predominantly grey-brown plumage, though males may bear isolated blue and black feathers. No separate subspecies are recognised. Similar in appearance and closely related to the [[Variegated Fairy-wren]] (''M. lamberti'') and the [[Blue-breasted Fairy-wren]] (''M. pulcherrimus''), it is regarded as a separate species as no intermediate forms have been recorded where ranges overlap. Though the Red-winged Fairy-wren is locally common, there is evidence of a decline in numbers.

Bearing a narrow pointed bill [[Adaptation|adapted]] for probing and catching insects, the Red-winged Fairy-wren is primarily insectivorous; it forages and lives in the shelter of scrubby vegetation in temperate wetter forests dominated by the Karri (''[[Eucalyptus marginata]]''), remaining close to cover to avoid predators. Like other fairy-wrens, it is a cooperative breeding species, with small groups of birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. Groups consist of a socially [[monogamous]] pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the young. There is a higher proportion of female helpers recorded for this species than for other species of fairy-wren. A variety of vocalisations and visual displays have been recorded for communication and courtship in this species. Singing is used to advertise territory, and birds can distinguish other individuals on song alone. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females as part of a courtship display. 

==Taxonomy==
The Red-winged Fairy-wren was officially described by ornithologist [[John Gould]] in 1837, who derived the bird's specific name derived from the Latin term ''elegans'' 'elegant'.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Birds of Australia and the adjacent islands, Part 1|author=Gould J |year=1837 |publisher=J. Gould |location=London}}</ref> He gave its location as the East Coast, but realised his error after further collections by John Gilbert from Southwestern Australia.<ref name ="Rowley173"/>Amateur ornithologist [[Gregory Mathews]] described birds from the southern Karri forests as subspecies ''warreni'' in 1916 on the basis of darker female plumage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mathews GM|year=1916|title=List of additions of new subspecies to, and changes to, my list of the birds of Australia |journal=Austral. Avian Record |volume=3 |pages=25<U+2013>68}}</ref> However, others have not observed this subsequently and the consensus is that no separate subspecies are recognized.<ref name=Schodde82>Schodde R (1982) ''The fairy-wrens: a monograph of the Maluridae''. Lansdowne Editions, Melbourne.</ref> In fact there is little variation in size or colour within the species between populations or individuals.<ref name ="Rowley401">Rowley & Russell, p. 40<U+2013>41</ref> 

It is one of 12 species of the genus ''[[Malurus]]'', commonly known as fairy-wrens, found in Australia and lowland [[New Guinea]].<ref name = "Rowley143">Rowley & Russell, p. 143</ref> Within the genus it belongs to a group of four very similar species known collectively as Chestnut-shouldered Fairy-wrens. The other three species are  the [[Lovely Fairy-wren]] ''(M.&nbsp;amabilis)'' of [[Cape York]], the [[Variegated Fairy-wren]] ''(M.&nbsp;lamberti)'' found across most of the continent, and the [[Blue-breasted Fairy-wren]] ''(M.&nbsp;pulcherrimus)'' of southern Western Australia and the [[Eyre Peninsula]].<ref name = "Rowley159">Rowley & Russell, p. 159</ref> Molecular study showed the Blue-breasted Fairy-wren to be the most closely related to the Red-winged Fairy-wren.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Christidis L, Schodde R |year=1997|title=Relationships within the Australo-Papuan Fairy-wrens (Aves: Malurinae): an evaluation of the utility of allozyme data |journal=Australian Journal of Zoology |volume=45 |issue=2|pages=113<U+2013>129 |doi=10.1071/ZO96068 |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=ZO96068 (abstract) |accessdate=2007-09-20}}</ref>

Like other [[fairy-wren]]s, the Red-winged Fairy-wren is unrelated to the true [[wren]]s. Initially fairy-wrens were thought to be a member of the old world flycatcher family [[Muscicapidae]] or warbler family [[Sylviidae]] before being placed in the newly recognised [[Maluridae]] in 1975.<ref>{{Citation | author = Schodde R | title = Interim List of Australian Songbirds | year = 1975 | publisher = [[Birds Australia|RAOU]]|location = Melbourne}}</ref> More recently, [[DNA]] analysis has shown the family to be related to Meliphagidae ([[honeyeater]]s), the [[Pardalotidae]], and the [[Petroicidae]] (Australian robins) in a large superfamily [[Meliphagoidea]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Barker |first=FK |coauthors= Barrowclough GF, Groth JG |year=2002 |title=A phylogenetic hypothesis for passerine birds; Taxonomic and biogeographic implications of an analysis of nuclear DNA sequence data |journal=Proc.

===Evolutionary history===
In his 1982 [[monograph]], [[ornithologist]] Richard Schodde proposed a northern origin for the Chestnut-shouldered Fairy-wren group due to the variety of forms in the north and their absence in the southeast of the continent.<ref name =Schodde82/> Ancestral birds spread south and colonised the southwest during a warm and wetter period around 2 million years ago at the end of the [[Pliocene]] or beginning of the [[Pleistocene]]. Subsequent cooler and drier conditions resulted in loss of habitat and fragmentation of populations. Southwestern birds gave rise to what is now the Red-winged Fairy-wren, while those in the northwest of the continent became the Variegated Fairy-wren. Further warmer, humid conditions again allowed birds to spread southwards; this group, occupying central southern Australia east to the Eyre Peninsula, became the Blue-breasted Fairy-wren. Cooler climate after this resulted in this being isolated as well and evolving into a separate species. Finally, after the end of the [[last glacial period]] 12,000&ndash;13,000&nbsp;years ago, the northern Variegated forms have again spread southwards. This has resulted in the ranges of all three species overlapping. Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified.<ref name =Schodde82/>

Like other fairy-wrens, the Red-winged Fairy-wren is notable for its marked [[sexual dimorphism]], males adopting a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue and chestnut contrasting with black and grey-brown. The brightly coloured crown, ear tufts and upper back are prominently featured in breeding displays.<ref name ="Rowley4344">Rowley & Russell, p. 43-44</ref> The male in breeding plumage has a silvery blue crown, ear coverts and upper back, a black throat and nape, bright red-brown shoulders, a long grey-brown tail and wings, and greyish-white belly. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour, though males may retain traces of blue and black plumage. All males have a black bill and lores (eye-ring and bare skin between eyes and bill), while females have a black bill, rufous lores and pale grey eye-ring. Immature males will develop black lores by six weeks of age and generally moult into an incomplete breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching.<ref name ="Rowley172-73">Rowley & Russell, p. 172<U+2013>73</ref> This has a patchy or spotty appearance, with a mixture of blue and grey feathers on the head, and black and grey on the breast; birds born early in the breeding season will gain more nuptial plumage initially than those born late. Most perfect their nuptial moult by their second spring, though some may need another year.<ref name ="Russell91">{{cite journal|author=Russell EM, Rowley I, Brown RJ, Brown MN|year=1991|title=Acquisition of nuptial plumage in the Red-winged Fairy-wren ''Malurus elegans'' |journal=Corella |volume=15|pages=125<U+2013>33}}</ref> Several males have been observed in breeding plumage in a single group at the same time, although it is unknown if or how this is related to dominance or breeding status.<ref name ="Rowley46">Rowley & Russell, p. 46</ref>

They will moult again into nuptial plumage in winter or spring.<ref name ="Rowley173"/> Body feathers are replaced at both moults while wing and tail feathers are in spring only, though the latter may be replaced at any time if damaged or worn.<ref name ="Rowley45">Rowley & Russell, p. 45</ref> The blue coloured plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, of the breeding males is highly [[iridescent]] due to the flattened and twisted surface of the [[barbule]]s.<ref name ="Rowley44">Rowley & Russell, p. 44</ref> The blue plumage also reflects [[ultraviolet]] light strongly, and so may be even more prominent to other fairy-wrens, whose colour vision extends into this spectrum.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bennett ATD, Cuthill IC |year=1994|title=Ultraviolet vision in birds: what is its function? |journal=Vision Research |volume=34|issue=11 |pages=1471<U+2013>78| doi=10.1016/0042-6989(94)90149-X| pmid=8023459}}</ref>

Vocal communication among Red-winged Fairy-wrens is used primarily for communication between birds in a social group and for advertising and defending a territory.<ref name ="Rowley63">Rowley & Russell, p. 63</ref> They are able to distinguish different individuals on the basis of song alone, which is integral to the identification of group members and strangers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Payne RB, Payne LL, Rowley I, Russell EM |year=1991|title=Social recognition and response to song in cooperative Red-winged Fairy-wrens |journal=Auk |volume=108 |pages=811<U+2013>19}}</ref> The basic, or Type I, song is a 1<U+2013>4 second high-pitched reel consisting of 10<U+2013>20 short elements per second; it is sung by both males and females, particularly when there is a dispute over territory boundaries.<ref name ="Rowley656">Rowley & Russell, p. 65<U+2013>66</ref><ref name ="Rowley173"/> Singing occurs most frequently before and just after dawn.<ref name ="Rowley66">Rowley & Russell, p. 66</ref> Foraging birds maintain contact with each other by soft, repeating ''see-see-see'' descending tones, while a loud, sharp ''tsit'' serves as an alarm call.<ref name ="Rowley173">Rowley & Russell, p. 173</ref>

Survival of fairy-wrens from one season to the next is generally high for such small birds, and the Red-winged Fairy-wren has the highest rate of all&mdash;with 78% of breeding males and 77% of breeding females surviving from year to year.<ref name ="Rowley1289">Rowley & Russell, p. 128-29</ref> It is not unusual for Red-winged Fairy-wrens to reach 10 years of age, and the oldest known individual to date attained an age of 16 years.<ref name ="Rowley130">Rowley & Russell, p. 130</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:Pemberton Karri forest 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eucalyptus diversicolor|Karri]] Forest near [[Pemberton, Western Australia|Pemberton]],<br> the preferred habitat]] 
The Red-winged Fairy-wren occurs in the wetter, southwest corner of Western Australia, from [[Moore River (Western Australia)|Moore River]] north of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] south through to the [[Margaret River, Western Australia|Margaret River]] region and east to [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]].<ref name ="Rowley173"/> It is common in parts of its range,<ref>{{cite book|title=Birds of Australia|author=Flegg J, Madge S|year=1995|publisher=New Holland Press |location=Kenthurst, NSW |isbn=1853683531}}</ref> though there is some evidence of decline from draining of swampland.<ref>Higgins PJ, Peter JM, Steele WK (Eds.)

Forestry plantations of pine (''[[Pinus]]''  spp.) and eucalypts are generally unsuitable as they lack undergrowth.<ref name ="Rowley134">Rowley & Russell, p. 134</ref>

Within the forest habitat, the Red-winged Fairy-wren prefers wetter gullies and riverside Sword Sedge (''[[Lepidosperma effusum]]'').<ref name ="Rowley175">Rowley & Russell, p. 175</ref> It borders the range of the Variegated Fairy-wren on the northern limit of its range, and the Blue-breasted Fairy-wren in the eastern limit, with the latter two species occupying dryer scrub while the Red-winged Fairy-wren is restricted to wetter forests.<ref name ="Rowley173"/> The lack of intermediate forms reinforces the status of all  three taxa as separate species.<ref name ="Rowley164">Rowley & Russell, p. 164</ref>

==Behaviour==
Hopping, with both feet leaving the ground and landing simultaneously, is the usual form of locomotion, though birds may run while performing the 'Rodent Run Display' detailed below.<ref name = "row42">Rowley & Russell, p. 42</ref> Its balance is assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually held upright and rarely still. The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts.<ref name = "row41">Rowley & Russell, p. 41</ref> 

The Red-winged Fairy-wren is a cooperative breeding species, with a pair or small group of birds maintaining and defending a territory year-round. These territories average around 0.4<U+2013>2.4&nbsp;[[hectare]]s (1<U+2013>6&nbsp;[[acre]]s) in optimal habitat of tall Karri forest, although are smaller and restricted to dense riverbank undergrowth in less favourable habitat.<ref name ="Rowley175"/>
The area maintained is large enough to support the group in poor years or to accommodate new members after a good breeding season.<ref name ="Rowley58">Rowley & Russell, p. 58</ref> Groups range from two to nine members in size with an average of four birds,<ref name ="Rowley175"/> the largest for any fairy-wren studied to date. This is thought to be due to a very high annual survival and occupancy of suitable territory. Though reproduction rates are low, young birds still have few vacancies available for them to disperse into.<ref name ="Rowley56">Rowley & Russell, p. 56</ref> Pairs are socially [[monogamous]], with relationships ending for the most part when one partner dies. The survivor in this case selects a new partner, often a helper bird in the group. Though not directly studied, paired Red-winged Fairy-wrens are likely to be sexually [[promiscuous]], with each partner mating with other individuals.<ref name ="Rowley175"/> Female helpers are much more common in this species than the other species intensively studied, the [[Superb Fairy-wren]] (''M. cyaneus'').<ref name ="Rowley88"/> Over half the groups have two or more helpers, often female, which feed nestlings and reduce workload of breeding females.<ref name ="Rowley93">Rowley & Russell, p. 93</ref> Helpers have been shown to improve reproductive success in this species by increasing the numbers of young raised successfully per year from 1.3 to 2 birds.<ref name ="Rowley94">Rowley & Russell, p. 94</ref> There is some evidence that groups with male helpers may enlarge the territory boundaries with a subsequent 'budding-off' of a new territory by a helper.<ref name ="Rowley99">Rowley & Russell, p. 99</ref>

Major nest predators include [[Australian Magpie]]s ''(Gymnorhina tibicen)'', [[butcherbird]]s (''Cracticus'' spp.), [[Laughing Kookaburra]] ''(Dacelo novaeguineae)'', [[currawong]]s (''Strepera'' spp.), [[crow]]s and [[raven]]s (''Corvus'' spp.), [[shrike-thrush]]es (''Colluricincla'' spp.) as well as introduced mammals such as the [[Red Fox]] (''Vulpes vulpes''), [[cat]] and [[Black Rat]] ''(Rattus rattus)''.<ref name = "row121">Rowley & Russell, p. 121</ref> Like other species of fairy wrens, Red-winged Fairy-wrens may use a 'Rodent-run' display to distract predators from nests with young birds. While doing this, the head, neck and tail of the bird are lowered, the wings are held out and the feathers are fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call.<ref name ="Rowley175"/>

The 'Wing-fluttering' display is seen in several situations: females responding, and presumably acquiescing, to male courtship displays, juveniles while begging for food, by helpers to older birds, and immature males to senior ones. The fairy-wren lowers its head and tail, outstretches and quivers its wings and holds its beak open silently.<ref name ="Rowley77">Rowley & Russell, p. 77</ref>

===Diet===
Like all fairy-wrens, the Red-winged Fairy-wren is an active and restless feeder,<ref name = "row42"/> foraging in [[bracken]] (''Pteridium esculentum'') and low shrubs, as well as in leaf-litter on the ground near shelter. It will occasionally ascend trees up to {{convert|5|m|ft|0|lk=off|abbr=on}} above the ground in the understorey, particularly in the late summer and autumn as the flaking eucalypt bark is a rich source of [[arthropod]]s. However, birds are exposed to potential predators and forays are therefore brief. It consumes a wide range of small creatures, mostly insects, eating ants and beetles year-round, and adding spiders, bugs and caterpillars to their diet during breeding season.<ref name="Wooller81">{{cite journal |author=Wooller RD, Calver MC|year=1981|title=Feeding segregation within an assemblage of small birds in the karri forest understorey |journal=Australian Wildlife Research|volume=8|pages=401<U+2013>10}}</ref><ref name ="Rowley88">{{cite journal|author=Rowley I, Russell EM, Payne RB, Payne LL|year=1988|title=The ecology and breeding biology of the Red-winged Fairy-wren ''Malurus elegans'' |journal=Emu |volume=88|pages=161<U+2013>76}}</ref> During spring and summer, birds are active in bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. The group often shelters and rests together during the heat of the day. Food is harder to find during the winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously.<ref name ="row612">Rowley & Russell, p. 61<U+2013>62</ref> Ants in particular are an important food source during this period, constituting a much higher proportion of the diet.<ref name = "row4952">Rowley & Russell, p. 49<U+2013>52</ref>

===Courtship and reproduction===
Like other fairy-wrens, male Red-winged Fairy-wrens have been observed carrying brightly coloured petals to display to females as part of a courtship ritual. In this species, the petals that have been recorded have been yellow or, rarely, white.<ref name="Row91">{{cite journal |author=Rowley I|year=1991|title=Petal Carrying by Fairy-wrens of the genus ''Malurus'' |journal=Australian Bird Watcher |volume=14|pages=75<U+2013>81}}</ref> Petals are displayed and presented to a female in the male fairy-wren's own or another territory.<ref name ="Rowley75">Rowley & Russell, p. 75</ref> The 'Face fan' display is commonly seen as a part of aggressive or sexual display behaviours;<ref name ="Rowley175"/> it involves the flaring of the blue ear tufts by erecting the feathers.<ref name ="Rowley76">Rowley & Russell, p. 76</ref> The silvery blue upper back feathers are also used more prominently in display than other species.<ref name ="Rowley175"/>

The breeding season is shorter than that of other fairy-wrens, occurring from October (rarely September) through to December. Constructed solely by the female,<ref name = "Rowley91">Rowley & Russell, p. 91</ref> the [[Bird nest|nest]] is generally situated in thick vegetation and around 20&nbsp;cm (8&nbsp;in) above the ground. It is a round or domed structure made of loosely woven grasses and [[spider web]]s, with an entrance in one side. The interior may be lined with finer grass and material from ''[[Clematis pubescens]]'' and ''[[Banksia grandis]]''. One or rarely two broods may be laid in a season, the second being laid on average 51 days after the first.<ref name ="Rowley88"/> A clutch consists of two or three matte cream-white [[egg (biology)|eggs]] tapered oval in shape with reddish-brown splotches and spots, measuring 12 x 16&nbsp;mm (.45&nbsp;x&nbsp;.6&nbsp;in).<ref>{{cite book  | last = Beruldsen  | first = G  | title = Australian Birds: Their Nests and Eggs  | publisher = self  | date = 2003  | location = Kenmore Hills, Qld  | pages = 279<U+2013>80 | id = ISBN 0-646-42798-9}}</ref> The female incubates the eggs alone for around an hour at a time, after which the male calls her and she will leave to forage urgently for 15<U+2013>30 minutes before returning. Her long tail is often bent from the cramped nest space and is a useful field indicator of nesting.<ref name = "Rowley116">Rowley & Russell, p. 116</ref> Incubation takes 14 to 15&nbsp;days, a day less in later broods,<ref name ="Rowley88"/> and an estimated 94% of eggs hatch successfully. The newly hatched nestlings are [[altricial]]<U+2013>raw red in colour, naked and blind. Within a day, their skin darkens to blue<U+2013>grey colour as their feathers develop underneath. Sheathed primary feathers emerge through the skin by the third day and eyes begin to open on the fifth day and fully open on the next. Young are fed and their [[fecal sac]]s removed by all group members for 11<U+2013>12&nbsp;days, by which time they are fledged. Though fully feathered, their tails and wings are not fully grown and they are poor fliers.<ref name = "Rowley117">Rowley & Russell, p. 117</ref> Their wings take another 10 days to develop fully, during which time they generally stay well hidden in cover near the nest. Parents and helper birds will feed them for around one month after fledging. Young birds often remain in the family group as helpers for a year or more before moving to another group. Birds reach sexual maturity at one year of age, but females tend not to breed until their third year as breeding vacancies are scarce.<ref name = "row1756">Rowley & Russell, p. 175<U+2013>76</ref> The nests of Red-winged Fairy-wrens rarely play host to [[brood parasite]]s, though parasitism by the [[Horsfield's Bronze-Cuckoo]] ''(Chrysococcyx basalis)'' and [[Fan-tailed Cuckoo]] ''(Cacomantis flabelliformis)'' has been recorded.<ref name = "row176">Rowley & Russell, p. 176</ref>
