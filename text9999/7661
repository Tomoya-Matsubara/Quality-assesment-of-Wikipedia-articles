{{politics of Kosovo}}
On 17 February 2008, the [[Assembly of Kosovo]], a body of the [[Provisional Institutions of Self-Government]] under the [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] (UNMIK), [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|unilaterally declared independece]]. This move was controversial among the international community. As of 9 October 2008 the '''[[Republic of Kosovo]]''' has been recognised by {{Kosovorecognition}} UN member states and the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]).

At present, fourteen states maintain embassies in [[Pristina]]; additionally, Liechtenstein's interests are represented by the Swiss embassy. Kosovo is also host to six non-resident ambassadors, as well as 10 liaison offices. Russia maintains a liaison office with UNMIK.

The government of the Republic of Kosovo has allocated one million [[euro]]s to establish a Ministry of Foreign Affairs. [[Skender Hyseni]] has been requested to be the Foreign Minister.<ref>[http://www.newkosovareport.com/20080425906/Politics/One-million-euros-for-Kosovo-Foreign-Ministry.html "One million euros for Kosovo Foreign Ministry"], ''newkosovareport.com'', [[25 April]] [[2008]].

==Europe==
===European Union===
{{Main|Accession of Kosovo to the European Union}}
The [[European Union]] does not possess the legal capacity to diplomatically recognise any state; member states do so individually.  The majority of member states have recognised Kosovo.  To articulate a [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|common EU policy]] of either support or opposition to Kosovan independence would require unanimity on the subject from all 27 member states, which does not presently exist.  On 18 February, the EU officially stated that it would ''take note'' of the resolution of the Kosovo assembly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/9/25684 |title=EUobserver.com |publisher=Euobserver.com |author=Elitsa Vucheva |date= |accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref> The EU is sending a [[European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo|EULEX]] mission to Kosovo, which includes a special representative and 2000 police and judicial personnel.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/serbia-russia-fury-kosovo-independence-draws-near/article-170333|title=Serbia, Russia fury as Kosovo independence draws near|publisher=EurActiv|date=2008-02-15|accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/9/25660 |title=EUobserver.com |publisher=Euobserver.com |author=Renata Goldirova |date= |accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref>

Only one of the Arab countries have so far recognised the independence of Kosovo, the [[United Arab Emirates]] on 14 October 2008. [[Skender Hyseni]] met with ambassadors of [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]] and  UAE in May 2008 in Vienna. Qatar and Saudi Arabia indicated they had begun the recognition process and Abdulrahman Al-Suahibani, Charg<U+00E9> d'Affaires of the Saudi Arabian embassy in Vienna told Hyseni that he had been "instructed by his government to communicate to Kosovo<U+2019>s Foreign Minister that Saudi Arabia will recognise Kosovo very soon".<ref name="balkaninsight">{{cite news|title=Kosovo Seeks Arab Recognition|work=balkaninsight.com|publisher=Balkan Investigative Reporting Network|date=2008-05-27|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/10480/|accessdate=2008-05-27|quote=None of the Arab countries has recognised the move, although some, including Saudi Arabia, have indicated that they have begun the recognition process.

However, this dialogue is opposed by the Kosovar government as some of the Arab representatives are dissidents in Arab states.

===Israel===
The issue of Kosovo is sensitive to Israelis, many of whom are descendants of survivors of various ethnic cleansing campaigns and genocides, including: [[the Holocaust]]. Israelis have aided Kosovo refugees in the past, including establishing the only hospital for miles on Macedonia's border. Many Israelis have rallied in support of the Kosovar cause.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/315126.stm Israel divided on Kosovo]</ref> Jerusalem sent massive humanitarian aide to the besieged Kosovars during and after the 1998-1999 [[Kosovo War]]. Jewish groups worldwide are also involved in aide to Kosovo's Muslim majority, and even helped to rebuild mosques damaged during the fighting. The Israeli government has delayed recognizing Kosovo and chooses to monitor developments in the region and international community before making a decision. Some concerns include the fact the secession is unilateral, and that recognition may have implications on the Palestinian (and Israeli Arab) issue<U+2014>an analogy the Albanian ambassador in Israel rejects, citing major historical and political differences.<ref>[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=2&cid=1203343699593&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull Israel won't recognize Kosovo, for now | Jerusalem Post<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=Gjuraj>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1195546731795&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull|title=Kosovo deserves independence|author=Tonin Gjuraj}}</ref> Israel and Serbia also share increasingly close economic ties, and Serbia's ambassador in Israel claims he has been assured by Israeli officials that Israel will not recognize Kosovo.<ref>[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1196847321972 The case against Kosovo independence]</ref> However, Israeli officials indicate that that recognition is probably just a matter of time considering Israel's closest ally (the [[United States]]) and other "influential friends" in Europe have recognized the new state.[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&cid=1203343699593][http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/955214.html] Israel supports the [[Contact Group]] principles.<ref name=Gjuraj/>
