An '''onion dome''' (Russian: <U+043B><U+0443><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447><U+043D><U+0430><U+044F> <U+0433><U+043B><U+0430><U+0432><U+0430>, ''l<U+00FA>kovichnaya glava'') is a type of architectural [[dome]] usually associated with [[Russian Orthodox church|Russian]] [[Orthodox church (building)|Orthodox church]]es. Such a dome is larger in diameter than the drum it is set upon and its height usually exceeds its width. These bulbous structures taper smoothly to a point, and strongly resemble the [[onion]], after which they are named.

Other important types of Orthodox cupolas are antique ''helmet domes'' (for example, those of the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] and [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir]]), Ukrainian ''pear domes'' ([[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]]), and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] ''bud domes'' ([[St. Andrew's Church of Kiev|St. Andrew's Church]] in [[Kiev]]).

==History==

Art historians disagree when and why onion domes became a typical feature of [[Russian architecture]]. [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine churches]] and [[architecture of Kievan Rus]] were characterized by broader, flatter domes without a special framework erected above the drum. In contrast to this ancient form, each drum of a Russian church is surmounted by a special structure of metal or timber, which is lined with sheet iron or tiles.

By the end of the nineteenth century, most Russian churches from before the [[Petrine Baroque |Petrine period]] had bulbous domes. The largest onion domes were erected in the seventeenth century in the area around [[Yaroslavl]], incidentally famous for its large onions. Quite a few had more complicated bud-shaped domes, whose form derived from Baroque models of the late seventeenth century. Pear-shaped domes are usually associated with [[Ukrainian Baroque]], while cone-shaped domes are typical for Orthodox churches of [[Transcaucasia]]. 

=== Traditional view ===

In the early history of the Russian Church, especially in Kiev, the first capital, the domes of the churches followed the typical Byzantine rounded style, but later Russian churches tended toward the onion domes, a form particularly suitable for northern climes and preventing snow from piling on the roof. Orthodox influences also spread to Persian architecture and points further east, exemplified by the iconic domes of the 1630 Taj Mahal. 

But some scholars postulated that onion domes were borrowed by Russians from Muslim countries, probably from the [[Khanate of Kazan]], whose conquest Ivan the Terrible commemorated by erecting St. Basil's Cathedral. However, that theory is no longer accepted since earliest know onion domes in Russia were build in the XIIth century (Church of the Intercession of the Holy Virgin upon Nerl River (1165) and Saviour Cathedral in Pereslavl-Zalesskii (1152-57)).

=== Alternative theories ===
[[Image:Vytegra.jpg|thumb|250px|Wooden churches in [[Kizhi]] and Vytegra have as many as twenty-five onion domes]]

In 1946, the historian [[Boris Rybakov]], while analysing [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript) |miniatures]] of ancient Russian chronicles, pointed out that most of them, from the thirteenth century onward, display churches with onion domes rather than helmet domes.<ref><U+0411>.<U+0410>.<U+0420><U+044B><U+0431><U+0430><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432>. <U+00AB><U+041E><U+043A><U+043D><U+0430> <U+0432> <U+0438><U+0441><U+0447><U+0435><U+0437><U+043D><U+0443><U+0432><U+0448><U+0438><U+0439> <U+043C><U+0438><U+0440> (<U+043F><U+043E> <U+043F><U+043E><U+0432><U+043E><U+0434><U+0443> <U+043A><U+043D><U+0438><U+0433><U+0438> <U+0410>.<U+0412>.<U+0410><U+0440><U+0446><U+0438><U+0445><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+00AB><U+0414><U+0440><U+0435><U+0432><U+043D><U+0435><U+0440><U+0443><U+0441><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0435> <U+043C><U+0438><U+043D><U+0438><U+0430><U+0442><U+044E><U+0440><U+044B> <U+043A><U+0430><U+043A> <U+0438><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+0438><U+0447><U+0435><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0438><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0447><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A><U+00BB>). <U+0412> <U+043A><U+043D>.: <U+0414><U+043E><U+043A><U+043B><U+0430><U+0434><U+044B> <U+0438> <U+0441><U+043E><U+043E><U+0431><U+0449><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+044F> <U+0438><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+0438><U+0447>. <U+0444><U+0430><U+043A><U+0443><U+043B><U+044C><U+0442><U+0435><U+0442><U+0430> <U+041C><U+0413><U+0423>. <U+0412><U+044B><U+043F>.

XIX. <U+041C>., 1954. <U+0421>. 73.</ref> These findings demonstrated that Russian onion domes could not be imported from the Orient, where onion domes did not replace spherical domes until the fifteenth century.

Sergey Zagraevsky, a modern art historian, surveyed hundreds of Russian [[icon]]s and miniatures, from the eleventh century onward. He concluded that most icons painted after the Mongol invasion of Rus display only onion domes.<ref>See photographs [http://www.zagraevsky.ru/glavi.htm on his website].</ref> He found only one icon from the late fifteenth century displaying a dome resembling the helmet instead of an onion. His findings led him to dismiss fragments of helmet domes discovered by restorators beneath modern onion domes as post-Petrine stylisations intended to reproduce the familiar forms of Byzantine cupolas. Zagraevsky also indicated that the oldest depictions of the two Vladimir cathedrals represent them as having onion domes, prior to their replacement by classicizing helmet domes.

Zagraevsky explains the ubiquitous appearance of onion domes in the late thirteenth century by the general emphasis on verticality characteristic of Russian architecture from the late twelfth to early fifteenth centuries.<ref><U+0413>.<U+041A>.<U+0412><U+0430><U+0433><U+043D><U+0435><U+0440>. <U+041E> <U+0441><U+0432><U+043E><U+0435><U+043E><U+0431><U+0440><U+0430><U+0437><U+0438><U+0438> <U+0441><U+0442><U+0438><U+043B><U+0435><U+043E><U+0431><U+0440><U+0430><U+0437><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+044F> <U+0432> <U+0430><U+0440><U+0445><U+0438><U+0442><U+0435><U+043A><U+0442><U+0443><U+0440><U+0435> <U+0414><U+0440><U+0435><U+0432><U+043D><U+0435><U+0439> <U+0420><U+0443><U+0441><U+0438> (<U+0432><U+043E><U+0437><U+0432><U+0440><U+0430><U+0449><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+0435> <U+043A> <U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0431><U+043B><U+0435><U+043C><U+0435>). <U+0412> <U+043A><U+043D>.: <U+0410><U+0440><U+0445><U+0438><U+0442><U+0435><U+043A><U+0442><U+0443><U+0440><U+043D><U+043E><U+0435> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0441><U+043B><U+0435><U+0434><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432><U+043E>. <U+0412><U+044B><U+043F>. 38. <U+041C>., 1995. <U+0421>. 25.</ref> At that period, porches, pilasters, vaults and drums were arranged to create a vertical thrust, to make the church seem taller than it was.<ref>See, for instance, the most authoritative survey of early Russian architecture: <U+041F>.<U+0410>.<U+0420><U+0430><U+043F><U+043F><U+043E><U+043F><U+043E><U+0440><U+0442>. <U+0414><U+0440><U+0435><U+0432><U+043D><U+0435><U+0440><U+0443><U+0441><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430><U+044F> <U+0430><U+0440><U+0445><U+0438><U+0442><U+0435><U+043A><U+0442><U+0443><U+0440><U+0430>. <U+0421><U+041F><U+0431>, 1993.</ref> It seems logical that elongated, or onion, domes were part of the same proto-Gothic trend aimed at achieving pyramidal, vertical emphasis.<ref>Another important consideration proposed by Zagraevsky links the onion-shaped form of Russian domes with the weight of traditional Russian crosses, which are much larger and more elaborate than those used in Byzantium and Kievan Rus. Such ponderous crosses would have fallen aground during a storm, if they had not been fixed to sizeable stones traditionally placed inside the elongated domes of Russian churches. It is impossible to place such a stone inside the flat dome of the Byzantine type.</ref>

==Symbolism==
[[Image:Ivanvelikiy.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin]] (sixteenth century)]]

Prior to the eighteenth century, the Russian Orthodox Church did not assign any particular symbolism to the exterior shape of a church.<ref><U+0411><U+0443><U+0441><U+0435><U+0432><U+0430>-<U+0414><U+0430><U+0432><U+044B><U+0434><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430> <U+0418>.<U+041B>.

In 1917, noted religious philosopher Prince [[Yevgeny Trubetskoy]] argued that the onion shape of Russian church domes may not be explained rationally. According to Trubetskoy, drums crowned by tapering domes were deliberately scored to resemble candles, thus manifesting a certain aesthetic and religious attitude.<ref>"The Byzantine cupola above the church represents the vault of heaven above the earth. On the other hand, the Gothic spire expresses unbridled vertical thrust, which rises huge masses of stone to the sky. In contrast to these, our native onion dome may be likened to a tongue of fire, crowned by a cross and tapering towards a cross. When we look at the [[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]], we seem to see a gigantic candle burning above Moscow. The Kremlin cathedrals and churches, with their multiple domes, look like huge chandeliers. The onion shape results from the idea of prayer as a soul burning towards heaven, which connects the earthly world with the treasures of the afterlife. Every attempt to explain the onion shape of our church domes by utilitarian considerations (for instance, the need to preclude snow from piling on the roof) fails to account for the most essential point, that of aesthetic significance of onion domes for our religion. Indeed, there are numerous other ways to achieve the same utilitarian result, e.g., spires, steeples, cones. Why, of all these shapes, ancient Russian architecture settled upon the onion dome? Because the aesthetic impression produced by the onion dome matched a certain religious attitude. The meaning of this religious and aesthetic feeling is finely expressed by a folk saying - "glowing with fervour" - when they speak about church domes". - See <U+0415>.<U+041D>.<U+0422><U+0440><U+0443><U+0431><U+0435><U+0446><U+043A><U+043E><U+0439>. <U+0422><U+0440><U+0438> <U+043E><U+0447><U+0435><U+0440><U+043A><U+0430> <U+043E> <U+0440><U+0443><U+0441><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0439> <U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+043D><U+0435>. 1917. <U+041D><U+043E><U+0432><U+043E><U+0441><U+0438><U+0431><U+0438><U+0440><U+0441><U+043A>, 1991. <U+0421>. 10.</ref> Another explanation has it that the onion dome was originally regarded as a form reminiscent of the [[edicula]] (cubiculum) in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]].<ref><U+041B><U+0438><U+0434><U+043E><U+0432> <U+0410>.<U+041C>. <U+0418><U+0435><U+0440><U+0443><U+0441><U+0430><U+043B><U+0438><U+043C><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+043A><U+0443><U+0432><U+0443><U+043A><U+043B><U+0438><U+0439>. <U+041E> <U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0438><U+0441><U+0445><U+043E><U+0436><U+0434><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+0438> <U+043B><U+0443><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447><U+043D><U+044B><U+0445> <U+0433><U+043B><U+0430><U+0432>. // <U+0418><U+043A><U+043E><U+043D><U+043E><U+0433><U+0440><U+0430><U+0444><U+0438><U+044F> <U+0430><U+0440><U+0445><U+0438><U+0442><U+0435><U+043A><U+0442><U+0443><U+0440><U+044B>.

Onion domes often appear in groups of three, representing the Holy Trinity, or five, representing Jesus Christ and the [[Four Evangelists]].  Domes standing alone represent Jesus.  [[Vasily Tatischev]], the first to record such interpretation, disapproved of it emphatically.  He believed that the five-domed design of churches was propagated by [[Patriarch Nikon]], who liked to compare the central and highest dome with himself and four lateral domes with four other [[patriarchs]] of the Orthodox world. There is no other evidence that Nikon ever held such a view.

The domes are often brightly painted: their colours may informally symbolise different aspects of religion.  Green, blue, and gold domes are sometimes held to represent the [[Holy Trinity]], the Holy Spirit, and [[Jesus]], respectively.  Black ball-shaped domes were once popular in the snowy north of Russia.
