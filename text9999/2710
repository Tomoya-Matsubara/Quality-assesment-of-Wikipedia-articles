==Early life and education==
Qiu Xigui was born in July 1935 in [[Shanghai]] of [[Ningbo]] ancestry. In 1952 he was admitted to the history department of [[Fudan University]], and was interested in pre-[[Qin dynasty]] Chinese history. Under the influence of the renowned [[oracle bones]] expert [[Hu Houxuan]] ({{lang|zh-hans|<U+80E1><U+539A><U+5BA3>}}), he took interest in the oracle bones and [[Chinese bronze inscriptions]]. After graduating in 1956, he became a graduate student of oracle bones and [[Shang dynasty]] history, studying under Professor Hu. The same year, Hu was transferred to the Institute of History of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] in [[Beijing]], and Qiu followed Hu to the institute.<ref name=pku>{{cite web |title=Qiu Xigui |url=http://localsev.lib.pku.edu.cn/bdms/bdms_portal/mr_index.asp?id=69 |publisher=Peking University |language=Chinese |accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=xinhua>{{cite web |title=<U+6BB7><U+589F><U+FF1A><U+8457><U+540D><U+5B66><U+4EBA> <U+88D8><U+9521><U+572D> |trans_title=Famous scholar Qiu Xigui |url=http://www.ha.xinhuanet.com/fuwu/kaogu/2006-01/06/content_5978322.htm |publisher=Xinhua |accessdate=19 April 2014 |language=Chinese |date=6 January 2006}}</ref>

==Career==
After finishing his graduate studies in 1960, Qiu was assigned to be a teaching assistant at the department of Chinese of [[Peking University]] (PKU). From 1964 to 1966, Qiu, like many other intellectuals, was sent to the countryside to be "reeducated by peasants" as part of [[Chairman Mao]]'s [[Socialist Education Movement]]. He was sent to [[Jiangling County]], [[Hubei]] and [[Yanqing County]], Beijing. During the subsequent [[Cultural Revolution]], he worked as a labourer at a farm in [[Jiangxi]] province from 1969 to 1971.<ref name=pku/>

In 1972, Qiu participated in the research of [[Han dynasty]] documents excavated from [[Mawangdui]], under the leadership of [[Zhu Dexi]]. From 1974 to 1976, he worked under Zhu at the Wenwu (Cultural Relics) Publishing House, where they researched the [[Yinqueshan Han Slips]] and other excavated [[bamboo and wooden slips]]. He became an associate professor at PKU in 1978 and a full professor in 1983.<ref name=pku/>

From 1982 to 1983, Qiu taught Chinese palaeography at [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]] as a visiting scholar. From February to July 1998, he gave lectures on palaeography and ancient literature at the Chinese department of [[National Tsing Hua University]] in [[Taiwan]].<ref name=pku/> In November 2000, he was awarded an [[honorary doctorate]] by the [[University of Chicago]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Pan |first=Zhen |title=<U+4E0E><U+53E4><U+6587><U+5B57><U+5B66><U+6CF0><U+6597><U+804A><U+5929> |url=http://shszx.eastday.com/node2/node22/wyfc/userobject1ai7072.html|publisher=Eastday |accessdate=20 April 2014 |language=Chinese}}</ref>

In 2005, Qiu returned to his alma mater Fudan University to lead its Center for Research on Chinese Excavated Classics and Palaeography.<ref name=pku/>

==Publications==
Much of Qiu Xigui's research findings were published in his 1988 book ''Wenzixue Gaiyao'' ({{lang|zh-hans|<U+6587><U+5B57><U+5B66><U+6982><U+8981>}}).<ref name=pku/> According to American [[sinologist]] [[Edward L. Shaughnessy]], the book is the "single most influential study of Chinese palaeography", and "universally acclaimed to be the definitive overview" of the field.<ref name=shaughnessy/> It was translated into English by Gilbert L. Mattos and [[Jerry Norman]], two leading Western scholars of Chinese linguistics, and published in 2000 under the title ''Chinese Writing''.<ref name=shaughnessy/>

As of 2002, Qiu had published about 300 academic papers, some of which were included in his 1992 book ''Guwenzi Lunji'' ({{lang|zh-hans|<U+53E4><U+6587><U+5B57><U+8BBA><U+96C6>}}, "Collected Papers on Palaeography").<ref name=pku/><ref name=xinhua/> In 2012, the ''Collected Works of Qiu Xigui'' (<U+88D8><U+9521><U+572D><U+5B66><U+672F><U+6587><U+96C6>), comprising six volumes and three million [[Chinese characters|characters]], was published by Fudan University Press.<ref>{{cite web |last=Li |first=Yu |title=<U+300A><U+88D8><U+9521><U+572D><U+5B66><U+672F><U+6587><U+96C6><U+300B><U+51FA><U+7248> |url=http://www.csstoday.net/Item/29354.aspx |publisher=Chinese Academy of Social Sciences |accessdate=21 April 2014 |language=Chinese |date=30 October 2012}}</ref>
