'''''Hylton v. United States''''', [[Case citation|3 U.S. 171]] (1796), was an early [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that a tax on carriages did not violate the [[direct tax clause]] by defining the carriage tax as an "excise" instead of a "direct tax" that would have had to be apportioned among the states by population. This interpretation of the federal tax power lasted until modified in ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.]]'' (1895), in which the Supreme Court held an unapportioned 1894 federal income tax on interest, dividends and rents to be unconstitutional because the tax was a "direct tax" that had to be apportioned. The ''Pollock'' decision was overturned by the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]] (1913), which allows the Congress to impose a tax on incomes from "whatever source derived" without any requirement for apportionment.

The Justices at the time, rather than issue an opinion of the Court, instead issued [[seriatim]] opinions, with each writing separately and reading their own analysis in turn. This case was the first time [[Judicial Review]] came up in the United States Supreme Court. The Court heard the case about upholding the federal carriage tax, and found it constitutional. The power of [[Judicial Review]] was not controversial until ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' in 1803.

[[Alexander Hamilton]] appeared before court for the government, arguing that the tax was a valid use of the power of Congress. Justice James Iredell wrote, two days after the event: "Mr. Hamilton spoke in our Court, attended by the most crowded audience I ever saw there, both Houses of Congress being almost deserted on the occasion. Though he was in very ill health, he spoke with astonishing ability, and in a most pleasing manner, and was listened to with the profoundest attention. His speech lasted about three hours."
