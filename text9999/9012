'''Felix Anthony "Doc" Blanchard''' (December 11, 1924 <U+2013> April 19, 2009) is best known as the college [[football]] player who became the first ever [[Junior (education)|junior]] to win the [[Heisman Trophy]]. He also won the [[Maxwell Award]] and was the first ever football player to win the [[James E. Sullivan Award]]. He played football for the [[United States Military Academy|United States Military Academy at West Point]] [[Army Black Knights football]] team. Because his father was a doctor, Felix Blanchard was nicknamed "Little Doc" as a boy.<ref name="Blanchard, 'Doc' (Felix A.)">{{cite web |author=Hickok, R |title=Blanchard, "Doc" (Felix A.) |work=Sports Biographies, HickokSports.com (2002, 2003, 2004) |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/blnchrdc.shtml |accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref> After football, he served in the [[United States Air Force]] from 1947 until 1971 when he retired with the rank of [[Colonel]].

==Early years==
Blanchard was born on December 11, 1924 in [[Bishopville, South Carolina]]. His father was a doctor and had played college football at [[Tulane University]] and [[Wake Forest University]].<ref name="Blanchard, 'Doc' (Felix A.)"/> Blanchard, nicknamed "Little Doc" due to his father's occupation, attended high school at [[Saint Stanislaus College]] in [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi]]. He led the school's football team, the Rockachaws, to an undefeated season during his senior year in 1941. Blanchard was recruited to play college football by Army, [[Fordham University]] and the [[University of Notre Dame]], among others.<ref name="thestate2"/> Blanchard said in 1985 that he had been contacted about going to West Point when he was in high school.<ref name="thestate2"/> He said, "At that point in time, I really wasn<U+2019>t interested. Academically, I never was too hot, so I never had any idea I would pass the entrance examination and go to West Point."<ref name="thestate2"/>

Instead, Blanchard chose to play for the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|Tar Heels]], partly because the team was coached by his mother's cousin, [[Jim Tatum]].<ref name="espnacc">[http://www.goarmysports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=11100&ATCLID=3725083 ESPN: Blanchard More Than Football Hero]</ref> While at North Carolina, he played on the freshman team because in 1942, NCAA rules still prevented freshmen from playing for the varsity.<ref name="espnacc"/>

After completing his [[freshman]] season at North Carolina in 1942<ref name="thestate2"/>, he tried to enlist in the [[United States Navy]]'s [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12 program]], which allowed students to complete their education in return for a service commitment.<ref name="thestate2"/> He was rejected because he was considered overweight and had poor vision.<ref name="thestate2"/> He then enlisted in the [[United States Army]] until securing an appointment to West Point.<ref name="espnacc"/> He was stationed in New Mexico with a chemical-warfare unit until his father secured him an appointment to West Point, and he enrolled in July 1944.<ref name="thestate2"/><ref name="nyt"/>

==West Point years==
During his three years of playing football at West Point (he sat out the 1943 season<ref name="espnacc"/>), his team under coach [[Earl Blaik|Earl "Red" Blaik]] compiled an undefeated 27<U+2013>0<U+2013>1 record - the tie being [[1946 Army vs. Notre Dame football game|a famous 0<U+2013>0 game]]<ref name="espnacc"/> against [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]].<ref name="thestate2"/> In 1944, after a famous season-ending win over [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy]], General [[Douglas MacArthur]] even took time out from his war duties to send this [[Telegraphy|telegram]]:<ref name="thestate2"/>

{{cquote|The greatest of all Army teams ... We have stopped the [[World War II|war]] to celebrate your magnificent success. MacArthur.}}

Notre Dame coach [[Ed McKeever]] was amazed by Blanchard. After his 1944 team lost to Army by a score of 59<U+2013>0, McKeever said, "I've just seen [[Superman]] in the flesh. He wears number 35 and goes by the name of Blanchard."<ref name="nff">[http://www.footballfoundation.com/news.php?id=1902 National Football Foundation: Army's Felix "Doc" Blanchard Passes Away]</ref>

An all-around athlete, Blanchard served as the [[placekicker]] and [[punter (football position)|punter]] in addition to his primary roles as an [[fullback (American football)|offensive fullback]] and a [[linebacker]] on defense. In the first capacity, he teamed with soon to be fellow Heisman winner [[Glenn Davis (American football)|Glenn Davis]] (Davis won the Heisman the following year, 1946) to form one of the most lethal [[rush (American football)|rushing]] combinations in [[History of American football|football history]]. Blanchard, in his three seasons at West Point, scored 38 [[touchdown]]s, gained 1,908 yards and earned the nickname "Mr. Inside." Teammate Davis earned the nickname "Mr. Outside"<ref name="cnnsi">{{cite web |author=Lorge, S |title=Mr. Inside, Mr. Outside |work=Heisman Heroes, Sports Illustrated (CNN/Sports Illustrated 2001) |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/heisman/news/2000/09/15/blanchard_davis_0915/ |accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref> and in November 1945, they both shared the cover of [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine.<ref name="thestate2"/>

In 1945, he became the first college junior to ever win the Heisman Trophy and the first ever football player to win the James E. Sullivan Award.<ref name="thestate2"/> In 1984 at the awards ceremony marking the 50th Heisman Trophy presentation, Blanchard took the occasion to recall, in comparison to the big glitzy shows for the ceremony today, how he learned of his Heisman selection in 1945. He said, "I got a telegram. It said, 'You<U+2019>ve been selected to win the Heisman Trophy. Please wire collect.'"<ref name="nyt"/>

In 1946, Blanchard missed the first two games of the season due to an injury to his knee.<ref name="sa"/>

In 1947, Blanchard played himself in the movie ''[[The Spirit of West Point]]''. His West Point team-mate Glenn Davis also played himself in the film. Other cast members include [[Robert Shayne]] as Coach Colonel Earl "Red" Blaik, [[Anne Nagel]] as Mrs. Blaik, [[George O'Hanlon]] as Joe Wilson, Michael Browne as Roger "Mileaway" McCarty, Tanis Chandler as Mildred, Mary Newton as Mrs. Mary Blanchard and William Forrest as Doc Blanchard's father, Dr. Felix Blanchard. Also appearing as themselves are 1940 Heisman Trophy winner [[Tom Harmon]] and sportscasters [[Bill Stern]] and [[Harry Wismer]]. The screenplay was written by Tom Reed based on a story by Mary Howard. Ralph Murphy directed.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039858/ IMDb: The Spirit of West Point (1947)]</ref><ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/46110/The-Spirit-of-West-Point/overview New York Times: The Spirit of West Point (1947) overview]</ref><ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&res=9400E4DF1431E13BBC4B53DFB667838C659EDE New York Times: The Spirit of West Point (1947) movie review by B.C. Published: October 3, 1947 Accessed: April 20, 2009]</ref>

In addition to football, Blanchard was also a member of the Army [[track and field]] team. In a track meet in 1945, weighing in at 210 pounds and standing 6 feet 2 inches tall, he ran the [[100 yard dash]] in 10 seconds. He also won championships in the [[shot put]].<ref name="sa"/>

In 1947, Blanchard graduated from West Point and was commissioned as a [[Second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the [[United States Air Force]].<ref name="nyt"/> He coached Army<U+2019>s freshman team in the 1950s, but he never played professional football, choosing a military career instead.<ref name="nyt"/>

==Military career==
Blanchard had the opportunity to play professional football after being selected third overall in the [[1946 NFL Draft]] by the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.databasefootball.com/draft/draftyear.htm?lg=NFL&yr=1946|title=1946 NFL Draft|publisher=databaseFootball.com|accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref> Shortly after graduating from West Point in 1947, he and teammates Glenn Davis and [[Barney Poole]] sought four-month furloughs from military service in order to play in the NFL. Some Congressmen said the players were seeking special privileges, and the War Department turned down the request.<ref name="nyt"/>

Blanchard then chose to embark upon a career in the [[United States Air Force]] and became a [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] pilot. In 1959, while flying back to his base near London, an oil line in his plane broke and a fire broke out. He could have parachuted to safety, but the plane might have crashed into a village. He instead stayed with the plane and made a perfect landing. The event garnered him an Air Force commendation for bravery.<ref name="nyt"/>

In the [[Vietnam War]], Blanchard flew 84 missions over [[North Vietnam]]. He piloted a fighter-bomber during a one-year tour of duty that ended in January 1969.<ref name="nyt"/> He retired from the Air Force in 1971 as a colonel.<ref name="nyt"/><ref name="cnnsi"/>

==Death==
Blanchard died of [[pneumonia]] on April 19, 2009 in [[Bulverde, Texas]]. He had been living with his daughter Mary and her husband for the last 20 years of his life.<ref name="thestate2">[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iXgmyken_qyHJFNoZqbjplsgakowD97M0O600 Associated Press: Army's Mr. Inside, Doc Blanchard, dies at 84]</ref> In addition to his daughter Mary, Blanchard is survived by his daughter Jo Mills, his son Felix Blanchard III, a sister, Mary Elizabeth Blanchard and seven grandchildren.<ref name="nyt"/> His wife, Jody, died in 1994.<ref name="reprint"/> At the time of his death, he was the oldest living Heisman Trophy winner.<ref name="sa">[http://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/MYSA091306_01A_FBCblanchard_3590878_html2898.html San Antonio Express-News: 'Doc' Blanchard won't be part of the A&M vs. Army hoopla]</ref>

==Honors and memorials==
Blanchard was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1959.<ref name="thestate2"/>

At a 1991 ceremony, he presented his Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award and James E.

The trophy, awards and jersey were enshrined in the Brother Alexis Memorial Resource Center on the Saint Stanislaus campus until [[Hurricane Katrina]] washed them away in 2005. The items have since been recovered.<ref name="cnnsi"/><ref name="timespic"/>

In Blanchard's honor, the [[Interstate 20]] / [[U.S. Route 15]] interchange near his hometown of [[Bishopville, South Carolina]] has been named the Felix "Doc" Blanchard Interchange.<ref name="thestate">[http://www.thestate.com/scathletes/story/620947.html The State: Long-overdue honor for Blanchard comes soon]</ref> A three-statue bronze commemoration of Blanchard as a young boy, as a football hero and as an Air Force fighter pilot, will be unveiled in December 2009. It will stand in a park setting near the Bishopville<U+2019>s Woodward Public Library on Main Street.<ref name="thestate"/>

West Point announced in April 2009, before Blanchard's death, that it would retire the number 35 worn by Blanchard at a ceremony in the Fall of 2009.<ref name="nyt">[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/sports/ncaafootball/21blanchard.html New York Times: Doc Blanchard, Army<U+2019>s Mr. Inside, Is Dead at 84 ]</ref>
