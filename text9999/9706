[[Air Vice-Marshal]] '''Frank Headlam''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (15 July 1914&nbsp;<U+2013> 23&nbsp;December 1976) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born and educated in [[Tasmania]], he joined the RAAF as an air cadet in January 1934. He specialised in flying instruction and navigation before the [[Military history of Australia in World War II|outbreak of World War&nbsp;II]]. In April 1941, he became commanding officer of [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;2 Squadron]], which operated [[Lockheed Hudson]]s. The squadron was deployed to [[West Timor|Dutch Timor]] in December, and saw action against [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]]. After returning to Australia in February 1942, Headlam held staff appointments and training commands, finishing the war a [[group captain]].

Headlam served as Officer Commanding [[North Western Area Campaign|North-Western Area]] in 1946, and as Director of Training from 1947 to 1950. In 1950<U+2013>51, during the [[Malayan Emergency]], he was stationed at Singapore as commander of [[No. 90 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;90 (Composite) Wing]] and, later, [[Tengah Air Base|RAF Tengah]]. He twice served as acting Air Member for Personnel, in 1957 and 1959<U+2013>60, receiving appointment as a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1958. Promoted air vice-marshal, he successively held the positions of [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) [[RAAF Air Command|Operational Command]] in 1961<U+2013>62, AOC [[Far East Air Force (Royal Air Force)|No.&nbsp;224 Group RAF]] from 1962 to 1965 during the [[Indonesia<U+2013>Malaysia confrontation|Indonesia<U+2013>Malaysia ''Konfrontasi'']], [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]] in 1965<U+2013>66, and AOC Support Command in 1966<U+2013>67. He was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1965. Following a posting to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff from 1968 to 1971, he retired from the Air Force and died in [[Melbourne]] five years later.
