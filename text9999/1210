==Gameplay==
In ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'' and ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'', the player controls a set of characters, closely following the [[console role-playing game]] genre. The methods of viewing and controlling the characters are separated by three different "screens": the [[Overworld]], where the characters traverse to different locations; the field map, where the characters explore locations such as towns and [[dungeon (games)|dungeons]]; and the battle screen, where the characters fight with [[monster]]s or other enemies.

===''Final Fantasy IV''===
{{main|Final Fantasy IV#Gameplay}}
''Final Fantasy IV'' introduces the [[Active Time Battle]], a system designed by [[Hiroyuki Ito]]. It centers around the player inputting orders for the characters in real time during battles. Each character is balanced through certain strengths and weaknesses; for instance, a strong magic user may have low defense, while a physical fighter may have low agility.

===''Chrono Trigger''===
{{main|Chrono Trigger#Gameplay}}
''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s gameplay deviates from traditional role playing games in that, rather than [[random encounter]]s, many enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the field map itself rather than on a separate battle screen. ''Chrono Trigger'' uses an updated form of the Active Time Battle introduced in ''Final Fantasy IV'', with additions such as "Techs" that rely on enemy locations and abilities of characters. Other ideas are the employment of time travel and a [[New Game Plus]] option.

==Development==
''Final Fantasy Chronicles'' features two previously-released [[game port|ports]] by [[TOSE]]; ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'' and ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' were released separately, and ''Final Fantasy IV'' was re-released as a part of ''[[Final Fantasy Collection]]'', all published in Japan.<ref name="releasedateCT"><ref name="releasedateffcc">{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy Collection | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/finalfantasycollection/index.html | work=[http://www.gamespot.com/ GameSpot] | accessdate=9 March | accessyear=2007}}</ref> ''Chronicles'' was designed and directed by [[Kazuhiko Aoki]], supervised by [[Fumiaki Fukaya]], and produced by [[Akihiro Imai]].<ref name="Chronicles" /> It was created as a follow-up to ''[[Final Fantasy Anthology]]'', a compilation of ''[[Final Fantasy V]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]''.

It featured a [[cosplay]] contest, a memorabilia raffle, and booths to play ''Final Fantasy Chronicles'' and ''[[Final Fantasy X]]''.<ref>{{cite web | author=Ahmed, Shahed | title=Final Fantasy fan day | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/finalfantasychronicles/news.html?sid=2779055 | work=[http://www.gamespot.com GameSpot] | accessdate=July 2 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

===Additions and modifications===
The original ''Final Fantasy IV'' was released in [[North America]] as ''Final Fantasy II'' in [[1991]], with various [[Final Fantasy IV#Rereleases|"Easytype" modifications]].<ref name="ffcompendium-translation">{{Cite web | author=Kelley, Ian | title=FF4j/FF4j Easytype Changes FAQ | url=http://www.ffcompendium.com/h/faqs/ff4versions.txt | work=[http://www.ffcompendium.com/ FFCompendium] | accessdate=2006-09-12}}</ref> These were removed in the ''Final Fantasy Chronicles'' version, and the game was [[Internationalization and localization|re-localized]], achieving a script closer to the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] script by [[Takashi Tokita]].<ref name="Chronicles">{{cite book | year=2001 | editor=Square Enix staff | title=Final Fantasy Chronicles instruction manual | pages=54 | publisher=Square Enix | language=English | id=SLUS-01360}}</ref> ''Chrono Trigger'', released in [[1995]], was also localized by Ted Woolsey, but the ''Final Fantasy Chronicles'' version has few modifications.

A primary addition of both games is [[full-motion video]]. ''Final Fantasy IV'' features [[computer graphic]] sequences, while ''Chrono Trigger'' features [[anime]]-style sequences designed by [[Akira Toriyama]] that "help further tell the story of Chrono Trigger." ''Final Fantasy IV'' was given gameplay features such as a two-player mode, a "Sprint Feature" to "enhance and quicken gameplay", and the "Memo File" system to "reduce saving time." ''Chrono Trigger'', instead of gameplay features, has an "Extras Mode". This features databases such as a [[bestiary]], and the ability to view artwork created in development.<ref name="official">{{cite web | author=N/A | title=FINAL FANTASY CHRONICLES | url=http://na.square-enix.com/games/FFC/ | work=[http://na.square-enix.com/ Square Enix North America] | accessdate=June 2 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

==Merchandise==
''Music from Final Fantasy Chronicles'' is a set of two separately-released [[compact disc]]s published by [[TokyoPop]]. ''Final Fantasy IV Official Soundtrack'' and ''Chrono Trigger Original Soundtrack'' were both released on [[August 21]], [[2001]]. ''Final Fantasy IV Official Soundtrack'' includes an arranged version of "Theme of Love" by [[Shirou Satou]] totaling 44 tracks and 63 minutes.

==Reception and criticism==
''Final Fantasy Chronicles'' was commercially and critically successful, becoming the top selling [[PlayStation]] title for two weeks, and scoring an average of 89% in [[Metacritic]]'s aggregate, a review tallying website.<ref>{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy Chronicles (psx: 2001): Reviews | url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/psx/finalfantasychronicles | work=[http://www.metacritic.com Metacritic] | accessdate=June 2 | accessyear=2007}}</ref><ref name="ngi">{{cite web | year=July 13th, 2001 | title=Final Fantasy Chronicles Tops the Charts | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/096/096465p1.html | work=[http://psx.ign.com/articles/096/096465p1.html IGN] | accessdate=March 28 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Gaming website [[IGN]] rated it 9.4 and awarded an "Editor's Choice Award", calling the game a "must buy" for RPG fans.<ref name="ign">{{cite web | year=July 18th, 2001 | title=Final Fantasy Chronicles | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/166/166322p1.html | work=[http://psx.ign.com/articles/166/166322p1.html IGN] | accessdate=March 4 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>  

[[GameSpot]] reviewer Brad Shoemaker gave the game an 8.5, but cited "muffled sound effects" in ''Final Fantasy IV'', and was displeased with frequent loading in ''Chrono Trigger''. He added that the visuals were "stupendous" in their original release, but now look dated and will "turn off those looking for a bigger thrill for their gaming dollar".<ref>{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger represent some of the best that the Square of old had to offer. | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/finalfantasychronicles/review.html | work=[http://www.gamespot.com GameSpot] | accessdate=July 2 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Marcus Lai of [[Gaming Age]] was disappointed with a lack of additions, calling the ports "barebone games", and claiming the [[full motion video]]s are "nice touches to both games but don't add much".<ref>{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy Chronicles Review for PlayStation | url=http://www.gaming-age.com/cgi-bin/reviews/review.pl?sys=psx&game=ffc | work=[http://www.gaming-age.com Gaming Age] | accessdate=July 2 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>
