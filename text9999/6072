Korn achieved its name after a fan suggested the name "Corn". At first, the group rejected the idea, but later, with no alternate names, the group selected the name "Corn". Later, Shaffer suggested spelling their name with a "K" instead of a "C", and Shaffer came up with the idea to reverse the "R", so the band's name would appear as "Ko<U+042F>n".<ref name="arvizu 53-71"/> The logo was designed by [[singing|lead vocalist]] [[Jonathan Davis]].<ref name="small 16"/> Silveria explained, "the music makes the name, because Korn's a dumb name. But once we get established, it makes the name cool."<ref name="Small 1998 p. 16"/>

At [[Huntington Beach, California]], Korn rented a studio from Jeff Creath, called "Underground Chicken Sound." While they were recording at Underground Chicken Sound, a crowd had been [[loitering]] outside the studio.<ref name="fieldy 63">{{Harvnb|Arvizu|2009|p=63}}</ref> The band began playing a prelude to a later song, "Clown" resulting in a larger crowd gathering. Arvizu said the crowd gathered because it sounded so "different."<ref>{{Harvnb|Arvizu|2009|p=64}}</ref> Korn started performing at gigs in the summer of 1993, with members saying that touring was a "pain-in-the-ass." While in Huntington Beach, the band was spotted by Epic/Immortal Records A&R employee Paul Pontius. Pontius would describe Korn's sound as "the new genre of rock." In 1993, Korn released their first [[demo album]], ''[[Neidermeyer's Mind]]''. Their album had very limited printing, and was never well received by critics or fans.<ref name="small 16">{{Harvnb|Small|1998|p=16}}</ref> It was released to [[record companies]] and to people who filled out a flyer given out at gigs they played for free with [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]] and [[House of Pain]].<ref name="Small 1998 p. 16">Small 1998 p. 16</ref>

The album contained experiments and styles never previously attempted by Korn. ''Allmusic'' related: "The band is far more experimental this time out, delivering [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]]-like ringing guitars that melt and morph into each other, a mix of [[Metallica]]-esque blastbeats and tight funk drumming from the constantly improving [[David Silveria]], and memorable riffs that take the shape of dark sound structures and offer more than just a collection of chords."<ref>Torreano, Bradley [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r590483|pure_url=yes}} "allmusic ((( Untouchables > Overview )))"].

===Next album (2011<U+2013>present)===
According to guitarist [[James Shaffer|James "Munky" Shaffer]], Korn has begun writing new material for their next album. He explains, "We have probably three songs we wrote a couple, two, three months ago. We went into the studio, we wrote some songs, Jon demoed the songs on his computer, and then we took them into the studio and played them live and tweaked them a little bit. Then we put those down and recorded them. They're cool. They kind of remind me a little bit of the [[Soundgarden]] style, that sort of Seattle sound<U+2026> just one of them. The other songs are sort of different, a little more in the experimental stage right now. I don't want to give too much away. We're definitely moving forward, we'll probably start recording in April to try and finetune this sound we're developing."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=152668 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - KORN Begins Work On New Material |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-09}}</ref> It has been rumored across the web that Brendan O'Brien will be producing the album. He previously worked with the band on their fourth studio album, ''Issues''. It was also stated last year by Jonathan Davis in an interview with [[ARTISTdirect]] that one track recorded for the album features acoustic guitar <U+2014> a first for Korn <U+2014> tentatively titled "Lullaby for a Sadist".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/jonathan-davis-of-korn-talks-disturbed-tour-discovering-the-cure-acid-bath-and-more/8167471 |title=Jonathan Davis of Korn Talks Disturbed Tour, Discovering The Cure, Acid Bath and More - ARTISTdirect News |publisher=Artistdirect.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-09}}</ref>

The band's debut album warranted a [[Parental Advisory]] label solely because of the album's lyrics. Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song "[[Daddy (Korn song)|Daddy]]" was described by lead singer [[Jonathan Davis]] "When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I went to my parents and told them about it, and they thought I was lying and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't really like to talk about that song.

==Criticism and controversy==
===Vulgarity in lyrics===
Prior to the release of 1998's ''[[Follow the Leader (Korn album)|Follow the Leader]]'', Gretchen Plewes, a [[Zeeland, Michigan|Zeeland]] high school assistant principal, said in an interview for a [[Michigan]] newspaper that the music is "indecent, vulgar, obscene and intends to be insulting" after giving a student a one-day suspension for wearing a shirt with the Korn logo on it.<ref name="t shirt">Ross, Mike (98-09-17) [http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/K/Korn/1998/09/17/746668.html "Kids like their Korn"] ''Canoe''.
