{{2012 Pacific-12 football standings}}
The '''2012 USC Trojans football team''' represented the [[University of Southern California]] in the [[2012 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2012 NCAA Division I FBS college football season]]. The Trojans were led by third-year head coach [[Lane Kiffin]], played their home games at [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], and were members of the South Division of the [[Pacific-12 Conference]]. USC returned 18 starters and 13 All-Conference performers from a team that finished the 2011 season ranked No. 6 in the [[2011_NCAA_Division_I_FBS_football_rankings#AP_Poll|AP Poll]] with a 10<U+2013>2 record overall, and finished first in the South Division with a 7<U+2013>2 record in Pac-12 play.  However, as part of a two-year-post-season ban mandated by the [[NCAA]], the Trojans could not claim the 2011 Pac-12 South Division title, participate in the conference championship game or play in a bowl game. The 2012 season was the first year under Kiffin that the Trojans were eligible for post-season play. The Trojans, after staring the year ranked #1 in the AP poll, finished the season 7<U+2013>6, 5<U+2013>4 in Pac-12 play to finish tied for second in the Pac-12 South Division. They were invited to the [[2012 Sun Bowl|Sun Bowl]] where they were defeated by [[2012 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech]].

On December 22, 2011, All-American [[quarterback]] [[Matt Barkley]] announced that he would be returning to USC for his [[Senior (education)|senior season]] to complete some "unfinished business" for the Trojans.<ref>{{cite news |title=Matt Barkley Will Return to USC for Senior Season|first=Gary|last=Klein|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2011/12/usc-football-matt-barkley-lane-kiffin-nfl-draft-heisman-trophy.html|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 22, 2011|accessdate=December 22, 2011}}</ref>

On defense, the Trojans return seven starters and four All-Conference players, including first-team All-Conference performers in [[safety]] [[T. J. McDonald]] and [[cornerback]] Nickell Robey, senior [[defensive end]] [[Wes Horton]], and the team's co-leading tacklers in [[sophomore]] [[linebacker]]s Hayes Pullard and Dion Bailey, who was named the Pac-12 Freshman Defensive Player of the Year in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |title=All-Pac-12 Conference Football Team|url=http://www.pac-12.org/Football/Tabid/1452/Article/139179/All-Pac-12-Conference-Football-Team.aspx|publisher=Pacific 12 Conference|date=November 28, 2011|accessdate=November 28, 2011}}</ref>

Kalil is expected to be succeeded at left offensive tackle by true sophomore Aundrey Walker.  USC also graduated [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] [[Rhett Ellison]], who was also drafted by the Vikings at No. 128 overall in the Fourth Round.

Sophomore J.R. Tavai was moved to defensive end from nose tackle in fall camp, and will compete with redshirt freshman Greg Townsend to start at Left Defensive End. 

On July 31, former [[Penn State Nittany Lions]] running back [[Silas Redd]] announced his intent to transfer to USC in the wake of the [[Penn State child sex abuse scandal]].<ref name="redd"/>  Redd will be immediately eligible to play at USC during the 2012 season due to sanctions imposed by the NCAA.  On August 5, Redd officially enrolled at USC.

On August 24, starting cornerback [[Isiah Wiley]] was declared academically ineligible by the NCAA.  Sophomore Anthony Brown replaced Wiley in the starting lineup.

USC has been ranked number one in The [[Associated Press]]<U+2019> preseason college football poll for the seventh time in school history and the first time in five seasons, edging out No. 2 Alabama and No. 3 LSU.<ref>{{cite web|title=USC No. 1 In AP Top 25 Rankings, Alabama No. 2 And LSU No. 3|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/08/18/usc-no-1-in-ap-top-25-rankings-alabama-no-2-and-lsu-no-3/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter|publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]|accessdate=August 18, 2012}}</ref>

===Recruiting class===
{{see also|American football positions|Glossary of American football|Recruiting (college athletics)}}
Prior to [[National Signing Day]] on February 1, 2012, one junior college player and two high school players that graduated early enrolled for the spring semester in order to participate in spring practice.  These early enrollments included: defensive end Morgan Breslin from Diablo Valley Community College, linebacker Scott Starr from [[Norco High School]], and offensive tackle Chad Wheeler from [[Santa Monica High School]].  [[Safety (American and Canadian football position)|Safety]]/[[cornerback]] Joshua Shaw, who started three games at [[free safety]] for [[Florida Gators|Florida]] in 2011, transferred to USC in the spring.

USC's [[Recruiting (college athletics)|recruiting class]] was highlighted by six players from the "Rivals 100": No. 16 Zach Banner (OT), No. 18 Nelson Agholor (WR), No. 29 Jordan Simmons (G), No. 40 Jabari Ruffin (LB), No. 46 Max Tuerk (OT), No. 53 Leonard Williams (DE), and No. 82 Kevon Seymour (CB).  Despite being hampered by a 10-scholarship reduction imposed by the NCAA, USC still signed the No. 8 recruiting class according to ''[[Rivals.com]]'', the tenth-consecutive year that USC has had a class ranked in the Top 10.

The Cardinal have won four of the last five meetings (the Trojans won the 2008 game), with USC seeking to avenge close losses to the Stanford Cardinal over the last two seasons.  In 2010, Stanford defeated USC, 37<U+2013>35, on a last-second field goal that was made possible when the clock operator mistakenly stopped running the clock on Stanford's game-winning drive.  In 2011, Stanford defeated USC, 56<U+2013>48, in triple overtime when USC running back Curtis McNeal fumbled in the red zone.  With the game tied, 34<U+2013>34, at the end of regulation, USC attempted to call a timeout in order to attempt a game-winning field goal, but time had run out
