'''Kolli Hills''' ([[Tamil]]: <U+0B95><U+0BCA><U+0BB2><U+0BCD><U+0BB2><U+0BBF> <U+0BAE><U+0BB2><U+0BC8>) is a small mountain range located in central [[Tamil Nadu]] in [[India]]. The mountain ranges are about 1000 to 1300 m in height and cover an area of approximately 280 Km<sup>2</sup>. Kolli Hills is part of the [[Eastern Ghats]], which is a mountain range that runs mostly parallel to the east coast of [[South India]]. The mountains are relatively untouched by tourism and still retain their natural beauty. 

==Historical References==
The Kolli hills are featured in several works of classical Tamil literature such as [[Silappathigaram]], [[Manimekalai]], [[Purananuru]] and [[Ainkurnuru]]. The region was ruled by [[Valvil Ori]] around 200 A.D., who is praised as one of the seven great philanthropists of ancient Tamil Nadu. His valor and marksmanship are sung by several poets, and his exploits are a popular part of folklore. Ori is said to have killed a lion, bear, deer and a boar with a single arrow. 

The hills are said to be guarded by ''[[Kollipavai]]'', the local deity. According to legend, the sages chose Kolli hills when they were looking for a peaceful place to do their penance. However, the demons invaded the hills to disrupt the penance when the sages began their rituals. The sages prayed to Kollipavai, who according to the myth, chased away the demons with her enchanting smile. The Kollipavai is still worshipped by the people here and her smile is revered. The mountains have several mythological legends associated with them, and often come across as an eerie place in contemporary tales due to the unexplored and less traveled terrain.

==Farming and Vegetation==
Apart from its historical significance, the mountains are covered with evergreen forests, but increasing areas of forests are cleared for farming. Important farm products of the mountain ranges include coffee, tea, [[Jackfruit]], [[Pineapple]], [[Black pepper]] and other [[spices]]. [[Rice]] and other minor millets form the staple food of the tribal people who inhabit these mountains. The Jackfruit grown on these mountains is well known for its delicious taste and fragrance and is best savored by soaking in wild honey that is also harvested from these mountains. The mountains are covered by lush green vegetation in the spring and monsoon, and are streaked with streams which add to its beauty.

==Places of Interest==

==Agaya Gangai waterfalls==
A popular attraction on these mountains is the [[Agaya Gangai]] waterfalls. Reaching the waterfalls requires an hour long hike through a steep trail, and hiking back uphill is not recommended for those who dislike physical workouts. They can however take a dip in the river near the beginning of the trail. The end of the trail is separated from the base of the waterfalls by a body of flowing water, and is just an easy swim away. Adventurous hikers are recommended to follow the course of the river down from the base of the waterfalls where it flows through large rocks and provide serene solitude as well as a good workout.

===Temple===
The mountain is also a site of pilgrimage, the important destination being the [[Arapaleeswarar temple]] located nearby.

==Getting there==
The government also maintains a Pineapple research farm where hybrid varieties are created. Research about medicinal plants is also pursued on these mountains. The government holds a tourism festival in August, and mountains can be reached by road easily from [[Namakkal]] (50 km) or [[Salem|Salem, Tamil Nadu]] (100 km). The drive is scenic and is a steep climb through 72 [[hairpin bend]]s.
