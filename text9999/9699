He is a [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] [[Mandopop]] singer. He graduated from the National Changhua University of Education (NCUE), with a major in Guidance & Counseling. During his study at NCUE, he attended singing contests and won some prizes. He is now studying a Master Degree program in the Sports Psychology Department at the National Taiwan Sport University (NTSU).

==Music career==
===One Million Star (2007)===
Aska Yang debut in Taiwan as a contestant on [[One Million Star (season 1)|season one]] of Taiwanese TV singing contest [[One Million Star]]. He sang songs such as "<U+518D><U+898B><U+6211><U+7684><U+611B><U+4EBA>" (Goodbye My Love), "<U+4EBA><U+8CEA>" (Hostage), "<U+80CC><U+53DB>" (Betrayal), "<U+65B0><U+4E0D><U+4E86><U+60C5>" (New Endless Love). 

Nevertheless, the final ten contestants, including Yang, had released two compilation albums, ''Stars Reunion'' (<U+661F><U+5149><U+540C><U+5B78><U+6703>-<U+8D85><U+7D1A><U+661F><U+5149><U+5927><U+9053>10<U+5F37><U+7D00><U+5FF5><U+5408><U+8F2F>) and ''Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow'' (<U+611B>.<U+661F><U+5149><U+7CBE><U+9078>-<U+6628><U+5929> <U+4ECA><U+5929> <U+660E><U+5929>) in June and October respectively. He recorded a total of four songs in both albums:
# <U+201C>Because I believe (<U+56E0><U+70BA><U+6211><U+76F8><U+4FE1>)<U+201D> <U+2013> jointly sang with other contestants;
# <U+201C>Betrayal (<U+80CC><U+53DB>)<U+201D> <U+2013>  originally sung by [[Gary Cao]];
# <U+201C>Hostage (<U+4EBA><U+8CEA>)<U+201D> <U+2013>  originally sung by [[A-mei]]; and
# <U+201C>Broken Wings (<U+591A><U+9918>)<U+201D> <U+2013> theme song from the movie <U+201C>Keep Watching (<U+6C88><U+7761><U+7684><U+9752><U+6625>)<U+201D>, and it is the first original song of Aska Yang.
Later in the year, he was involved in a tense contract dispute with his manager, Hsu An-chin.  Because of the press attention, his name was frequently mentioned in the entertainment news headlines, in a sensational way, throughout the whole year of 2007.  For example, he was ranked second in "Person of the Year" by Yahoo!Taiwan<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tw.news.yahoo.com/article/url/d/a/071122/35/onks.html|publisher=Yahoo News|title={{zh icon}} 2007<U+5E74><U+5EA6><U+5341><U+5927><U+65B0><U+805E><U+4EBA><U+7269> <U+7B2C><U+4E8C><U+540D><U+694A><U+5B97><U+7DEF>|date=2007/11/22}}</ref> and was also listed in a book called "Who<U+2019>s Who in the ROC, 2007-2008".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/2007/08/21/119189/Whos-Who.htm|publisher=The China Post|title=Who<U+2019>s Who<U+2019> mentions 3,500 Taiwan celebrities|date=2007-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/08/21/2003375117|publisher=Taipei Times|title=Tennis star, singer make Taiwan's Who's Who list|date=2007-08-21}}</ref>

===Debut album & concert (2008)===
After reaching a new agreement with his manager at the end of 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ettoday.com/2007/11/06/340-2183116.htm|publisher=ETtoday|title={{zh icon}}  <U+5A66><U+63F4><U+6703><U+5C45><U+4E2D><U+5354><U+8ABF><U+FF5E><U+694A><U+5B97><U+7DEF><U+8207><U+8A31><U+5B89><U+9032><U+9054><U+6210><U+548C><U+89E3><U+3000><U+7C3D><U+8A02><U+65B0><U+7D04><U+FF01>|date=2007/11/5}}</ref> his musical career formally started. He released his debut solo album, titled ''Dove'' (<U+9D3F><U+5B50>), in January 2008, and it became the best-selling album in the first half of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sg.news.yahoo.com/xin/20090126/ten-500-jam-hsiao-aska-yang-defeat-yoga-3c1b9bc.html|publisher=Yahoo!Singapore News|title=Jam Hsiao and Aska Yang defeat Yoga Lin on G-music billboard|date=2009-01-27}}{{Dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref> The tracks "<U+6D0B><U+8525>" (Onion), "<U+9D3F><U+5B50>" (Dove) and "<U+5E78><U+798F><U+7684><U+98A8>" (Wind of Happiness) are listed at number 1, 5 and 12 respectively on [[Hit Fm Taiwan]]'s ''Hit Fm Annual Top 100 Singles Chart'' (Hit-Fm<U+5E74><U+5EA6><U+767E><U+9996><U+55AE><U+66F2>) for 2008.<ref>{{zh icon}} HITO Radio [http://www.hitoradio.com/charts/3c.php?ch_year=2008 ''Hit Fm Annual Top 100 Singles Chart''- 2008 (#1 to 50)] Retrieved 2011-05-20</ref> The track, "<U+9D3F><U+5B50>" (Dove) won one of the ''Top 10 Songs of the Year'' and "<U+6D0B><U+8525>" (Onion) won ''Best Loved Song by Audience'' at the 2009 HITO Radio Music Awards presented by Taiwanese radio station [[Hit Fm Taiwan|Hit FM]].<ref name=HITO2009>{{zh icon}} HITO Radio [http://www.hitoradio.com/music/460 2009 HITO Radio Music Awards winners list] 15 June 2009.

His fan base began to expand to other regions like Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2008/4/3/music/20814830&sec=music|publisher=The Star Online|title=Fans simply love rugged Aska|date=2008-04-03}}</ref> Yang also played his first solo concert in [[Taipei Arena]] in May, just four months after the release of his debut album. However, after the solo concert, he was embroiled in conflict with his manager again. The dispute resulted in a sudden pause in his career. In October 2008, Aska Yang formally announced the termination of his contract.

===Restart (2009)===
While attempting to resolve the outstanding contract issues by going to court, Aska restarted his music career in early 2009. He held a mini-concert in Taipei on 11 January and also began participating in other performance events, such as TV shows, concerts and musical plays. Outside the entertainment business, he enters the Graduate Institute of Physical Education of National Taiwan Sport University to study for a master's degree in Sport and Exercise Psychology.
