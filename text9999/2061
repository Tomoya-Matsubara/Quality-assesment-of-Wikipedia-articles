[[Neodymium]] magnets, usually small spheres, have been manufactured as educational toys. In several cases, children swallowed them, and injured their intestines, resulting in at least one death. As a result, regulatory agencies banned them, and the magnets are no longer marketed as toys. This led to a debate over the risks of toys and parental responsibility.

==Product positioning controversy==
In 2009, a number of US companies decided to repackage sphere magnets and sell them as toys. Despite existing toy regulations at the time, Maxfield & Oberton, maker of Buckyballs, told the New York Times that he saw the product on YouTube and repackaged them as Buckyballs.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/business/for-buckyballs-toys-child-safety-is-a-growing-issue.html |title=For Buckyballs Toys, Child Safety Is a Growing Issue |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 16, 2012 |first=Andrew |last=Martin}}</ref>

==Recalls==
Buckyballs launched at New York International Gift Fair in 2009 and sold in the hundreds of thousands before the [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission]] issued a recall on packaging labeled 13+.<ref>[http://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2010/Buckyballs-High-Powered-Magnets-Sets-Recalled-by-Maxfield-and-Oberton-Due-to-Violation-of-Federal-Toy-Standard/ Buckyballs<U+00AE> High Powered Magnets Sets Recalled by Maxfield and Oberton Due to Violation of Federal Toy Standard], Consumer Product Safety Commission, May 27, 2010.</ref> According to the CPSC, 175,000 units had been sold to the public. Fewer than 50 were returned.<ref>{{cite news|title=Craig Zucker: What Happens When a Man Takes on the Feds |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324108204579023143974408428.html|first=Sohrab|last=Ahmari|authorlink=Sohrab Ahmari|date=Aug 30, 2013|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=2013-09-01}}</ref> Buckyballs labeled "Keep Away From All Children" were not recalled.

Subsequently, Maxfield & Oberton changed all mentions of <U+201C>toy<U+201D> to <U+201C>desk toy<U+201D>, positioning the product as a stress-reliever for adults and restricted sales from stores that sold primarily children's products.<ref>[http://www.getbuckyballs.com/safety/retailers/ Buckyballs Safety Compliance], Maxfield and Oberton.</ref>

Further investigation by the CPSC in 2012 found an increasing trend of magnet ingestion incidents in young children and teens.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}  The commission cited hidden complications if more than one magnet becomes attached across tissue inside the body.

Another recall was issued for Buckyballs in 2012 along other similar products marketed as toys in the USA. Recalls and administrative complaints were filed against other similar US companies.  Maxfield & Oberton refused the recall and continued selling their desktop toys.  The company launched a political campaign against the CPSC, and Craig Zucker, the company's co-founder, debated the safety commission on FOX news.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/buckyballs-fight-back/2012/08/02/gJQA1G9uSX_story.html Buckyballs fight back], The Washington Post, August 2, 2012.</ref> On December 27, 2012, Maxfield & Oberton filed a Certificate of Cancellation with the Secretary of State of Delaware, declaring that the company no longer exists.

==New standards==
On March 12, 2013 the International Consumer Magnets Association formed a new subcommittee under ASTM for the development of product and marketing standards for all high-powered consumer magnetic products.

In the absence of an existing standard for magnetic products outside of toys, the US CPSC issued a new rulemaking proposal in 2012 that purports to ban all loose high powered magnet sets from being sold across the United States, regardless of their application. The CPSC continues to push forward with the topic despite strong consumer opposition,<ref>[http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketBrowser;rpp=25;po=0;dct=PS;D=CPSC-2012-0050 CPSC Safety Standard for Magnet Sets - Public Comments], Regulations.gov, November 19, 2012.</ref> actively lobbying medical associations, consumer associations, the press and health agencies outside of the US for support.
