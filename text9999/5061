The '''Tank, Cruiser, Ram''' was a [[cruiser tank]] designed and built by [[Canada]] in the [[Second World War]], based on the U.S. [[M3 Lee|M3 Medium]] tank. Due to standardization on the American [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tank]] for frontline units, it was used exclusively for training purposes and was never used in combat.

== Development ==
[[File:Ram tanks e010778900-v8.jpg|thumb|left|Ram Mk.II (early production) tanks during the war]]
Due to the loss of the majority of the United Kingdom's tank force in France, tank production in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] at the start of the war was insufficient and capacity in the US was taken for British needs so to supply Canada as well, so it was necessary, if Canada was to equip with tanks, to manufacture locally.<ref>Ellis and Chamberlain</ref> In June 1940 the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s Angus Shops in Montreal had received a contract to produce  488 [[Valentine tank]]s for the British and Canadian armies. However the Valentine was an [[infantry tank]] and Canada required a [[cruiser tank]] for its recently formed armoured division. In the end 1,940 Valentines were produced by CPR most of which were supplied to the USSR. Although the Valentine used a number of American produced parts, its reliance on British components, difficulties in adapting its manufacture to North American methods, and other problems such as limitations to the availability of the right type of armour plate affected Valentine production. The Canadian Joint Committee on Tank Development concluded, in September 1940, that its cruiser tank should be based on a US rather than a British design.<ref>Cameron, L.R.Tank Production in Canada AHQ Report 38, Department of National Defence Directorate of History and Heritage (DHH), 27 July, 1950 </ref>.

The Canadians were interested in production of the M3 Medium. However the M3 was an interim design and lacked a turret for its main armament. The British Tank Mission under which was involved in the modifications of the M3 for British use contributed a tank expert - L.E.Carr - to design a new  hull and turret for the Canadian tank, which could take a 6-pounder (57 mm) or 75mm gun while retaining the lower hull of the US M3 Medium.<ref>Fletcher p94</ref>

The new hull was cast rather than welded or riveted and lower than that of the M3. The pilot model's casting was produced in the US by General Steel Castings and latter then aided the set up of Canadian production.<ref>Ellis and Chamberlain</ref> [[Montreal Locomotive Works]] (MLW)  was chosen to make the new Canadian M.3 Cruiser Tank (as it was then known)and was given the funding to set up the ''Canadian Tank Arsenal'' at Lonque Pointe. MLW was a subsidiary of the [[American Locomotive Company]], which had experience in producing large castings and another ALCO subsidiary was producing cast hulls for the M3 Medium.

Canadian engineers ran into many challenges when developing the tank as Canada had never produced a tank before. Along with the lack of knowledge, it took time for Canadian factories to gear up for the production of many of the Ram's components and initially Canada relied heavily on United States and British materials to complete the construction of the Ram. Most critically the Ram's Continental engine and transmissions were available only in the USA and these were always in short supply. The Ram tank was developed with a turret which unlike the US M3 could traverse the main armament 360 degrees. Its fully cast armoured steel hull gave reinforced protection and - with the driver's seat repositioned to meet British requirements for right-hand drive<ref>Ellis and Chamberlain</ref> - lower height while the US designed chassis and power train ensured its overall reliability.<ref>Broad p27</ref> 

Although it could mount a US 75&nbsp;mm gun, the preferred armament for the Ram was the [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|QF 6 pounder]] which had superior armour-piercing capability. As it was not immediately available, early production (50 tanks) were fitted with  the 40 mm [[Ordnance QF 2 pounder|2-pounder]] gun. <ref>Fletcher p94</ref>

A prototype Ram was completed in June 1941 and general production of the Ram I began in November of the same year. The Ram I and early Ram IIs were fitted with side doors in the hull and an auxiliary machine gun turret in the front. The former weakened the hull and complicated production and the doors and the machine gun turret would be discarded in later modifications. By February 1942, production had switched to the Ram II model with a 6-pounder gun and continued until July 1943. In March 1942 a decision had been made to change production over to the automotively-similar M4A1 [[Sherman tank]] for all British and Canadian units. Ram production continued due to delay in starting the new M4 production lines and a reluctance to let the plant lie idle.<ref>Ellis and Chamberlain</ref> By July 1943 1,948 vehicles, plus 84 artillery observation post (OP) vehicles, had been completed. The official Canadian history of the war states that, in retrospect, it would probably have been better for the United States to produce more tanks, and for Canada to have focused on manufacturing more transport vehicles such as the successful [[Canadian Military Pattern truck]].<ref name="stacey1970">{{cite book | url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/his/docs/AMG_e.pdf | title=Arms, Men and Government: The War Policies of Canada, 1939 - 1945 | publisher=The Queen's Printer by authority of the Minister of National Defence | author=Stacey, C.

== Combat history ==
[[Image:Ram Mk 2 tank CFB Borden 1.jpg|thumb|left|Ram Mk.II - late production]]
As built, the Ram was never used in combat as a tank, but for crew training in Great Britain up to mid 1944. The observation post vehicles and Armoured Personnel Carrier, gun tower, and munitions carrier of the Ram saw considerable active service in North West Europe. These tanks were mainly rebuilt by Canadian Army workshops in the United Kingdom. Conversions of Ram tanks with the Wasp II flamethrower gear were used by the 5th Canadian Armoured Brigade in the Netherlands in 1943.<ref>Ellis and Chamberlain</ref>

[[Image:IJssellinie encased tank.jpg|right|thumb|A Ram encased in the Dutch IJssel Line, still present in 2007]]
In 1945 the [[Royal Netherlands Army]] got permission from the Canadian government to take possession for free of all Ram tanks in army dumps on [[Netherlands|Dutch territory]]. Those not already converted into [[Kangaroo (armoured personnel carrier)|Kangaroos]] were used to equip the 1st and 2nd Tank Battalion (''1e en 2e Bataljon Vechtwagens''), the very first Dutch tank units. These had a nominal organic strength of 53 each. However it proved to be impossible to ready enough tanks to attain this strength because the vehicles were in a very poor state of maintenance. In 1947 the UK provided 44 Ram tanks from its stocks, that were in a better condition. Forty of these had been rebuilt with the British 75&nbsp;mm gun; four were OP/Command vehicles with a dummy gun. This brought the operational total for that year to just 73, including two Mark Is. In 1950 only fifty of these were listed as present. The Ram tanks (together with the Sherman tanks of the three other tank battalions, in part simply taken without permission) were replaced by [[Centurion tank]]s leased by the U.S. Government in 1952.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Some Ram tanks were used in the 1950s as static pillboxes in the [[IJssel Line]], their hulls dug in and embedded within two feet of concrete.

==Survivors==
One Dutch Ram tank, an OP/Command vehicle, survives at the [[Dutch Cavalry Museum]] in [[Amersfoort]].

Ram tanks can also be seen at the [[Canadian War Museum]], in Worthington Park at [[CFB Borden|Canadian Forces Base Borden]], in front of the [[Beatty Street Drill Hall|Beatty Street Armoury]] in [[Vancouver]], and at the [[Bovington Tank Museum]] (both <ref>{{cite |url=http://www.tankmuseum.org/ixbin/indexplus?_IXSS_=_IXMENU_%3dtop%26ALL%3dram%26_IXACTION_%3dsummary%26%252asform%3d%252fsearch_form%252fbovtm_combined%26TYPE%3darticle%26_IXFPFX_%3dtemplates%252fsummary%252f&_IXFIRST_=2&_IXSPFX_=templates/full/tvod/t&_IXMAXHITS_=1&submit-button=summary&_IXMENU_=Vehicles |title=Tank Cruiser, Ram Mark II (E1988.23)|publisher=Tank Museum}}</ref> and Kangaroo<ref>{{cite |url=http://www.tankmuseum.org/ixbin/indexplus?_IXSS_=_IXMENU_%3dtop%26ALL%3dram%26_IXACTION_%3dsummary%26%252asform%3d%252fsearch_form%252fbovtm_combined%26TYPE%3darticle%26_IXFPFX_%3dtemplates%252fsummary%252f&_IXFIRST_=1&_IXSPFX_=templates/full/tvod/t&_IXMAXHITS_=1&submit-button=summary&_IXSESSION_=&_IXMENU_=Vehicles |title=Ram Kangaroo, Armoured Personnel Carrier, Full Tracked (E1985.121) |publisher=Tank Museum}}</ref>
