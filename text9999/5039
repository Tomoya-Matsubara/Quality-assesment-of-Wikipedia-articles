The '''Partitions of Poland''' or '''Partitions of the Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth''' took place in the second half of the 18th century and ended the existence of the [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth]], resulting in the elimination of sovereign [[Poland]] for 122 years. The [[Partition (politics)|partition]]s were perpetrated by the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Austria]], which divided up the Commonwealth lands among themselves progressively in the process of territorial seizures.<ref name="Brit"/><ref>Robert Bideleux, Ian Jeffries.

The [[First Partition of Poland|'''First Partition''']] of Poland, which was incapable of resisting, was decided on August 5, 1772. Two decades later, Russian and Prussian troops entered Poland again and the [[Second Partition of Poland|'''Second Partition''']] was signed off on January 23, 1793. Austria did not participate in the Second Partition. The [[Third Partition of Poland|'''Third Partition''']] took place on October 24, 1795, as soon as the Polish [[Ko<U+015B>ciuszko Uprising]] was defeated. With this partition, the independent state of [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland-Lithuania]] ceased to exist.<ref name="Brit"/>

The term "Partitions of Poland" is sometimes used geographically as [[toponymy]], to mean the three parts (or provinces) that the partitioning powers divided Poland into, i.e.: the [[Austrian partition]], the [[Prussian partition]] and the [[Russian partition]]. The term [[#"Fourth Partition"|"Fourth Partition of Poland"]] has been used in historiography in reference to any subsequent division of Polish lands. The term "Fourth Partition" in a temporal sense can also mean the diaspora communities that played important political role in reestablishing the Polish sovereign state after 1918.

=== Prelude ===
[[Image:Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772.PNG|266px|thumb|right|Before the partitions: The [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth]] as a protectorate of [[Russian Empire]] in 1772]]

During the reign of [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw IV Vasa|W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw IV]] (1632<U+2013>48), the ''[[liberum veto]]'' had evolved. This policy of parliamentary procedure was based on the assumption of the political equality of every "gentleman", with the corollary that unanimous consent was needed for all measures<!-- source: (EB.) -->. A single [[member of parliament]]'s belief that a measure was injurious to his own constituency (usually simply his own estate), even after the act had already been approved, became enough to strike the act. It became increasingly difficult to get action taken. The ''liberum veto'' also provided openings for foreign diplomats to get their ways, through bribing nobles to exercise it. <!-- (Encyclopaedia Britannica.) --> Thus, one could characterise Poland-Lithuania in its final period (mid-18th century) before the partitions as already not a completely sovereign state: it could be seen almost as a [[vassal state]],<ref name="Scott"/> or in modern terms, a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[satellite state]], with Russian [[tsar]]s effectively choosing Polish kings. This applies particularly to the last Commonwealth King [[Stanis<U+0142>aw August Poniatowski]], who for some time had been a lover of Russian Empress [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]]. 

In 1730 the neighbours of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ([[Rzeczpospolita]]), namely Prussia, Austria and Russia, signed a secret agreement to maintain the ''status quo'': specifically, to ensure that the Commonwealth laws would not change. Their alliance later became known in Poland as the "[[Alliance of the Three Black Eagles]]" (or ''L<U+00F6>wenwolde's Treaty''), because all three states used a black eagle as a state symbol (in contrast to the white eagle, a symbol of Poland). The Commonwealth had been forced to rely on Russia for protection against the rising [[Kingdom of Prussia]], while Prussia was demanding a slice of the northwest in order to unite its Western and Eastern portions, although this would leave the Commonwealth with a [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast only in [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]. <!-- source EB --> The Commonwealth could never be liquidated unless its longtime ally, [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], allowed it,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and first Catherine had to use diplomacy to win Austria to her side.

The Commonwealth had remained neutral in the [[Seven Years' War]], though sympathizing with the alliance of France, [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], and Russia, and allowing Russian troops access to its western lands as bases against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]. [[Frederick II of Prussia]] retaliated by ordering enough Polish currency counterfeited to severely affect the Polish economy. Through the [[szlachta|Polish nobles]] whom Russia controlled and the Russian Minister to Warsaw, ambassador and Prince [[Nicholas Repnin]], Empress Catherine the Great forced a constitution on the Commonwealth at the so-called [[Repnin Sejm]] of 1767, named after ambassador Repnin, who ''de facto'' dictated the terms of that Sejm (and who ordered the capture and exile  of some vocal opponents of his policies to [[Kaluga]] in Russian Empire.,<ref name="Scott">Hamish M.

Repnin also demanded religious freedom for the Protestant and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], and the resulting reaction among some of Poland's Roman Catholics, as well as the deep resentment of Russian intervention in the Commonwealth's domestic affairs, led to the War of the [[Bar Confederation|Confederation of Bar]]  from 1768<U+2013>1772, where the Poles tried to expel Russian forces from Commonwealth territory.<ref name="Scott"/><ref name="Hugh Seton-Watson"/> The irregular and poorly commanded Polish forces had little chance in the face of the regular Russian army and suffered a major defeat. Adding to the chaos was a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Cossack]] and peasant rebellion, the [[Koliyivschyna]], which erupted in 1768 and resulted in massacres of [[szlachta|noblemen]] (szlachta), Jews, [[Uniates]], and Catholic priests before it was put down by Polish and Russian troops.

In 1769 Austria annexed a small territory of [[Spisz]] and in 1770 - [[Nowy S<U+0105>cz]] and [[Nowy Targ]]. These territories had been a bone of contention between Poland and [[Hungary]], which was a part of the Austrian crown lands.

=== First Partition ===
{{Main|First Partition of Poland}}
[[Image:Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth 1773-1789.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth after the First Partition as a protectorate of Russian Empire 1773-1789]] 

In February, 1772, the agreement of partition was signed in [[Vienna]]. Early in August the Russian, Prussian and Austrian troops simultaneously entered the Commonwealth and occupied the provinces agreed upon among themselves. On August 5, 1772, the occupation manifesto was issued, much to the consternation of a country too exhausted by the endeavors of the Confederation of Bar to offer successful resistance;<ref name="Brit">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/466910/Partitions-of-Poland  "Partitions of Poland."] (2008). [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]] Online. Retrieved June 8, 2011.</ref> nonetheless several battles and sieges took place, as Polish troops refused to lay down their arms (most notably, in [[Tyniec]], [[Cz<U+0119>stochowa]] and [[Krak<U+00F3>w]]).

The partition treaty was ratified by its signatories on September 22, 1772. [[Frederick II of Prussia]] was elated with his success; Prussia took most of the Polish [[Royal Prussia]] that stood between its possessions in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], taking Ermland ([[Warmia]]), [[Royal Prussia]] without the city of [[Gda<U+0144>sk|Danzig]] (Gda<U+0144>sk) (which in 1773 became a new [[Provinces of Prussia|province]] called [[West Prussia]]), northern areas of [[Greater Poland]] along the [[Note<U+0107>]] River (the [[Netze District]]), and parts of [[Kuyavia]], (also the Prussian city of [[Toru<U+0144>|Thorn]] [Toru<U+0144>]).<ref name="Brit"/> Despite token criticism of the partition from Austrian Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], Austrian statesman [[Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz]] was proud of wresting as large a share as he did, with the rich salt mines of [[Bochnia]] and [[Wieliczka]]. To Austria fell Zator and Auschwitz ([[O<U+015B>wi<U+0119>cim]]), part of [[Little Poland]] embracing parts of the counties of Krak<U+00F3>w and Sandomir and the whole of Galicia, less the City of Krak<U+00F3>w. [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine of Russia]] was also very satisfied. By this "diplomatic document" Russia came into possession of that section of [[Livonia]] that had remained in Commonwealth control, and of [[Belarus]] embracing the counties of [[Vitebsk]], [[Polatsk|Polotsk]] and [[Mstislavl]].<ref name="Brit"/>
[[Image:Rejtan Upadek Polski Matejko.jpg|thumb|300px|''Rejtan - The Fall of Poland'', oil on canvas by Jan Matejko, 1866, 282 x 487 cm, [[Royal Castle in Warsaw]].]]

By this partition the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] lost about 30% of its territory, with a population of four million people (1/3 of its population), of which a large portion had not been ethnically Polish.<ref name="Brit"/> By seizing northwestern Poland, Prussia instantly gained control over 80% of the Commonwealth's total foreign trade. Through levying enormous customs duties, Prussia accelerated the collapse of the Commonwealth.

After having occupied their respective territories, the three partitioning powers demanded that King [[Stanis<U+0142>aw August Poniatowski|Stanis<U+0142>aw]] and the [[Sejm]] approve their action. When no help was forthcoming and the armies of the combined nations occupied Warsaw to compel by force of arms the calling of the assembly, no alternative could be chosen save passive submission to their will. The so-called [[Partition Sejm]], with Russian military forces threatening the opposition, on September 18, 1773, signed the treaty of cession, renouncing all claims of the Commonwealth to the occupied territories.

=== Second Partition ===
{{Main|Second Partition of Poland}}
[[Image:Rzeczpospolita Rozbiory 2.png|thumb|300px|After the Second Partition (1793)]]

By 1790, on the political front, the First Polish Republic had deteriorated into such a helpless condition that it was successfully forced into an unnatural and ultimately deadly alliance with its enemy, Prussia. The [[Polish-Prussian alliance|Polish-Prussian Pact]] of 1790 was signed. The conditions of the Pact contributed greatly to the succeeding and final two partitions of Poland-Lithuania. The [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|May Constitution of 1791]] enfranchised the bourgeoisie, established the separation of the three branches of government, and eliminated the abuses of [[Repnin Sejm]]. Those reforms prompted aggressive actions on the part of its neighbours, wary of the potential renaissance of the Commonwealth. Arguing that Poland had fallen prey to the radical [[Jacobinism]] then at high tide in France, Russian forces invaded the Commonwealth in 1792.

In the [[Polish-Russian War of 1792|War in Defense of the Constitution]], pro-Russian conservative Polish [[magnate]]s, the [[Targowica Confederation|Confederation of Targowica]], fought against Polish forces supporting the constitution, believing that Russians would help them restore the [[Golden Liberty]]. Abandoned by their Prussian allies, Polish pro-constitution forces, faced with Targowica units and the regular Russian army, were defeated. Prussia signed a treaty with Russia, agreeing that Polish reforms would be revoked and both countries would receive chunks of Commonwealth territory. In 1793, deputies to the [[Grodno Sejm]], last [[Sejm]] of the Commonwealth, in the presence of the Russian forces, agreed to Russian territorial demands. In the 2nd partition, Russia and Prussia helped themselves to enough more land so that only one-third of the 1772 population remained in Poland. Prussia named its newly gained province [[South Prussia]], with [[Posen]] (and later Warsaw) as the capital of the new province.

Targowica confederates, who did not expect another partition, and the king, [[Stanis<U+0142>aw August Poniatowski]], who joined them near the end, both lost much prestige and support. The reformers, on the other hand, were attracting increasing support, and in 1794 the [[Ko<U+015B>ciuszko Uprising]] begun.

=== Third Partition ===
{{Main|Third Partition of Poland}}

Kosciuszko's ragtag insurgent armies won some initial successes, but they eventually fell before the superior forces of the Russian Empire. The partitioning powers, seeing the increasing unrest in the remaining Commonwealth, decided to solve the problem by erasing any independent Polish state from the map. On 24 October 1795 their representatives signed a treaty, dividing the remaining territories of the Commonwealth among their three countries.

The Russian part included 120,000&nbsp;km<U+00B2> and 1.2 million people with [[Vilnius]] (Wilno), the Prussian part (new provinces of [[New East Prussia]] and [[New Silesia]]) 55,000&nbsp;km<U+00B2> and 1 million people with Warsaw, and the Austrian 47,000&nbsp;km<U+00B2> with 1.2 million and [[Lublin]] and Krak<U+00F3>w.

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and in their immediate aftermath the borders between partitioning powers shifted several times, changing the numbers seen in the preceding table. Following the [[Congress of Vienna]], Russia controlled 82% of the pre-1772 Commonwealth's territory (this includes its [[puppet state]] of [[Congress Poland]]), Austria 11%, and Prussia 7%.<ref>"Po przy<U+0142><U+0105>czeniu do obwodu bia<U+0142>ostockiego w 1807 roku do cesartwa i utworzeniu osiem lat p<U+00F3><U+017A>niej Kr<U+00F3>lestwa Polskiego wnuk Katarzyny zjednoczy<U+0142> pod swoim ber<U+0142>em oko<U+0142>o 82% przedrozbiorowego terytorium Rzeczypospolitej (dla por<U+00F3>wnania - Austria 11%, Prusy 7%).

Poland would be briefly resurrected<U+2014>if in a smaller frame<U+2014>in 1807, when Napoleon set up the [[Duchy of Warsaw]]. After his defeat and the implementation of the [[Congress of Vienna]] treaty in 1815, the Russian-dominated [[Congress Poland|Congress Kingdom of Poland]] was created in its place. After the Congress, Russia gained a larger share of Poland (with [[Warsaw]]) and, after crushing [[November Uprising|an insurrection in 1831]], the Congress Kingdom's autonomy was abolished and Poles faced confiscation of property, deportation, forced military service, and the closure of their own universities. After the [[January Uprising|uprising of 1863]], [[Russification]] of Polish secondary schools was imposed and the [[literacy]] rate dropped dramatically. In the Austrian portion, Poles fared better, and were allowed to have representation in Parliament and to form their own universities, and Krak<U+00F3>w and Lemberg (Lw<U+00F3>w/Lviv) became centers of Polish culture and education. Meanwhile, Prussia [[Germanisation of Poles during Partitions|Germanized]] the entire school system of its Polish subjects, and had no more respect for Polish culture and institutions than the Russian Empire. In 1915 a [[client state]] of the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] was proposed and accepted by the [[Central Powers]] of World War I: the [[Kingdom of Poland (1916<U+2013>1918)|Regency Kingdom of Poland]]. After the end of World War I, the [[Central Powers]]' surrender to the [[Allies of World War I|Western Allies]], the chaos of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the [[Treaty of Versailles]] finally allowed and helped the restoration of Poland's full independence after 123 years.

== "Fourth Partition" ==
The terminology describing the partitions of Poland can be somewhat confusing, as the first three partitions are sometimes used to refer to the three dates on which Poland was divided (1772, 1793, and 1795) and sometimes to the three geographic divisions (the German or Prussian partition, Austrian partition, and Russian partition).  The term "Fourth Partition" has also been used in both a temporal and a spatial sense.  

The term '''"Fourth Partition of Poland"''' may refer to any subsequent division of Polish lands, specifically:
* after the [[Napoleonic Era]], the 1815 division of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] at the [[Congress of Vienna]];
* the 1832 incorporation of the "[[Congress Poland|Congress Kingdom]]" into Russia, and the 1846 incorporation of the [[Free City of Krak<U+00F3>w|Republic of Krak<U+00F3>w]] into Austria; and
* the 1939 division of Poland between [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] pursuant to the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]].<ref name="Brecher">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =Michael Brecher| coauthors =Jonathan Wilkenfeld | title =A Study of Crisis | year =1997 | pages =255 | publisher =University of Michigan Press| isbn=0472108069 | url =http://books.google.com/books?visbn=0472108069&id=GjY7aV_6FPwC&pg=PA255&lpg=PA254&dq=Zeligowski+state&sig=uzmRepBmlI5W8pFsddP5qXsuBU0}}</ref>
If one accepts more than one of those events as partitions, fifth and sixth partitions can be counted, but these terms are very rare.

The term "Fourth Partition" was also used in the 19th and 20th centuries to refer to diaspora communities who maintained a close interest in the project of regaining Polish independence.<ref>Cygan, Mary. 1998. <U+201C>Inventing Polonia: Notions of Polish American identity, 1870-1990.<U+201D> Prospects 23, pp. 209-246.</ref>  Sometimes termed [[Polonia]], these expatriate communities often contributed funding and military support to the project of regaining the Polish nation-state.  Diaspora politics were deeply affected by developments in and around the homeland, and vice versa, for many decades.<ref>Lopata, Helena Znaniecka.  1994.  Polish Americans.

In current politics, the Polish [[right-wing politics|right-wingers]] occasionally warn of a Fourth Partition that would take place through purchase of the Polish properties by [[Germans]] and Jews.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=olpKYhgrS48C&pg=PA365&dq=Liga+Polskich+Rodzin&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=1970&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=1978&as_brr=3#v=onepage&q=</ref>

== Historiography ==
As historian [[Norman Davies]] stated, because the [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power equilibrium]] was observed, many contemporary observers accepted explanations of the "enlightened apologists" of the partitioning state.<ref name="Davies:Europe"/><ref name="Dav283">Norman Davies, God's Playground: A History of Poland in Two Volumes, Oxford University Press, 2005, ISBN 0199253390, [http://books.google.com/books?id=b912JnKpYTkC&pg=RA1-PA283&vq=the+coincidence+of+view&dq=noble+paradise+peasant+hell+purgatory&as_brr=3&sig=Majcm4VX29AJBOcijElu99V9iBA Google Print, p.283]</ref> 19th century historians from countries that carried out the partitions,  such as 19th century Russian scholar [[Sergey Solovyov]], and their 20th century followers, argued that partitions were justified, as the [[Commonwealth of Both Nations|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] had degenerated to the point of being partitioned because the counterproductive principle of ''[[liberum veto]]'' made decision-making on divisive issues, such as a wide-scale social reform, virtually impossible. Solovyov specified the cultural, language and religious break between the supreme and lowest layers of the society in the east regions of the Commonwealth, where the [[Bielorussian]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[serf]] [[peasantry]] was Orthodox. Russian authors emphasized the historical connections between Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, as former parts of the medieval old Russian state where dynasty of [[Rurikid]]s reigned ([[Kievan Rus]]).<ref>E.g., [[Sergey Solovyov]]'s ''History of the Downfall of Poland'' (Moscow, 1863).</ref> Thus, [[Nikolay Karamzin]] wrote: <U+201C>Let the foreigners denounce the partition of Poland: we took what was ours.<U+201D><ref>[http://rys-arhipelag.ucoz.ru/publ/6-1-0-133 <U+041D>.<U+041C>. <U+041A><U+0430><U+0440><U+0430><U+043C><U+0437><U+0438><U+043D>. <U+0417><U+0430><U+043F><U+0438><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430> <U+043E> <U+0434><U+0440><U+0435><U+0432><U+043D><U+0435><U+0439> <U+0438> <U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+043E><U+0439> <U+0420><U+043E><U+0441><U+0441><U+0438><U+0438> <U+0432> <U+0435><U+0435> <U+043F><U+043E><U+043B><U+0438><U+0442><U+0438><U+0447><U+0435><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+043C> <U+0438> <U+0433><U+0440><U+0430><U+0436><U+0434><U+0430><U+043D><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+043C> <U+043E><U+0442><U+043D><U+043E><U+0448><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+044F><U+0445>]</ref> Russian historians often stressed that Russia annexed primarily Ukrainian and Belorussian provinces with Eastern Slavic inhabitants,<ref>Nicholas V. Riasanovsky, ''Old Russia, the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe'', American Slavic and East European Review, Vol. 11, No. 3. (Oct., 1952), pp. 171-188</ref> although many [[Ruthenians]] were no more enthusiastic about Russia than about Poland, and ignoring ethnically Polish and Lithuanian territories also being annexed on a large scale (including the annexation of the undeniably Polish capital of [[Warsaw]]). A new justification for partitions arose with the [[Russian Enlightenment]], as Russian writers such as [[Gavrila Derzhavin]], [[Denis Fonvizin]], and [[Alexander Pushkin]] stressed degeneration of Catholic Poland and the need to "civilize" it by its neighbors.<ref name="NowakSarmatia">[[Andrzej Nowak (historian)|Andrzej Nowak]], ''[http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/197/Nowak.html The Russo-Polish Historical Confrontation]'', The [[Sarmatian Review]], January 1997, Volume XVII, Number 1</ref> 

Nonetheless other 19th century contemporaries were much more skeptical; for example, British jurist Sir [[Robert Phillimore]] discussed the partition as a violation of [[international law]];<ref name="">Sir [[Robert Phillimore]], ''Commentaries Upon International Law'', 1854

More recent studies claim that partitions happened when the Commonwealth had been showing the beginning signs of a slow recovery and see the last two partitions as an answer to strengthening reforms in the Commonwealth and the potential threat they represented to its neighbours.<ref name="Wandycz"/><ref name="Davies:Europe"/><ref name="NowakSarmatia"/><ref name="Army_Duchy">[http://web2.airmail.net/napoleon/polish_army.html The Army of Grand Duchy of Warsaw]</ref><ref name="Buffalohist3May">Hon.

== Trivia ==
The [[Ottoman Empire]] was the only country in the world that refused to accept the liquidation of the Republic of Poland as a result of partition and reserved a place in its diplomatic corps for an Ambassador of Lehistan (Poland).

The [[Italian National Anthem]] contains a reference to the partition.
