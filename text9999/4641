'''Andorra women's national football team''' is a youth national team as no senior national team exists.  They have not played in a single international match.

==The Team==
In 1985, almost no country in the world had a women's national football team,<ref name="McDougall2012">{{cite book|author=Chr<U+00F6>s McDougall|title=Soccer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2nrhG5ovUSQC&pg=PA45|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=1 January 2012|publisher=ABDO|isbn=978-1-61783-146-1|page=45}}</ref> including [[Andorra]] who currently do not have a senior women's national football team.

==Background and development==
With a [[FIFA]] trigramme of AND<ref name=never-ranked/> and having become a [[EFA]] affiliated in 1996, the national association did not respond to a survey about the status of women's football in the country. In May of the the following year, the official who answered another survey from FIFA reckoned there to be 37 active female players, all described as "100% beginners/amateurs". It was further suggested women's football had begun that year in Andorra and that there had been no previous interest in any women's sport. There was no participation in national or international competitions, though three women were employed in the association.<ref name="williams">{{cite web|url=https://www.dora.dmu.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2086/5806/Woman%27s%20football,%20Europe%20%26%20professionalization%201971-2011.pdf?sequence=1|title=Women's Football, Europe and Professionalization 1971-2011 |first=Jean|last=Williams|authorlink=Jean Williams (historian)|date= |accessdate=2012-04-15}}</ref> As of 2009, the programme was geared for young girls with player registration starting at the age of six.  There are only six women's teams in the country, all for girls under the age of sixteen and includes a national and schools competition.<ref name=goalsprogram2>{{cite web|accessdate=16 April 2012|publisher=FIFA|url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/goalproject/and_eng.pdf|date=26 November 2008|page=2|title=Goal!

This compares to 48% for youth football and 25% for infrastructure.<ref name=goalsprogram1>{{cite web|accessdate=16 April 2012|publisher=FIFA|url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/goalproject/and_eng.pdf|date=26 November 2008|page=1|title=Goal!
