During the Civil War the name of the seminary was changed to '''The Florida Military and Collegiate Institute''' and began military training for students.

The Florida State University ROTC streamer reads NATURAL BRIDGE 1865.  After the fall of the Confederacy, campus buildings were occupied by Union forces for over a month.  The West Florida Seminary reverted to a purely academic purpose after the war, and began a period of substantial growth and development.  In [[1884]], the school awarded its first diplomas, called Licentiates of Instruction.  In 1885 the Florida Legislature renamed the seminary the '''University of Florida''' in a law which was part of an effort by the Board of Education to reorganize Florida's system of higher education.  The school never embraced the title, apparently due to lack of funding from the Florida Legislature, but when other schools eventually tried to adopt the name "University of Florida" about 20 years later, officials from the Florida State College reminded the newcomers of the law and the original holder of the title in a 1903 university publication.<ref name="Official History of Florida State University U of F reference"> [http://www.fsu.edu/about/history.html] ''History of Florida State University, Office of the Dean of the Faculties, September 5, 2001 - "The following quote from the 1903 Florida State College Catalogue adds an interesting footnote to this period: In 1883 the institution, now long officially known as the West Florida Seminary, was organized by the Board of Education as The Literary College of the University of Florida. Owing to lack of means for the support of this more ambitious project, and also owing to the fact that soon thereafter schools for technical training were established, this association soon dissolved. It remains to be remarked, however, that the legislative act passed in 1885, bestowing upon the institution the title of the University of Florida, has never been repealed. The more pretentious name is not assumed by the college owing to the fact that it does not wish to misrepresent its resources and purposes."''

In 1901  the seminary was renamed the '''Florida State College''' and was organized into four departments (the College, the College Academy, the School for Teachers and the School of Music).  Florida State College was a four-year institution with authority to award the [[Master of Arts]] graduate degree.  The first [[master's degree]] was issued by the college in 1902.  

The 1905 Buckman Act reorganized the existing seven Florida colleges into three institutions, [[segregated]] by [[race]] and [[gender]] - a school for [[Caucasian]] [[males]], a school for Caucasian [[females]] and a school for [[African Americans]].  As a result of this reorganization, the coeducational Florida State College was renamed the '''Florida Female College''', (which by 1909  was changed to the '''Florida State College for Women''' (FSCW) after the initial women's title was generally rejected) and accepted only white female students.<ref name="Fountain and Westcott Building at Florida State College for Women">[http://fpc.dos.state.fl.us/reference/rc05025.jpg] ''State Library and Archives of Florida - Florida Photographic Collection, Westcott Building at the Florida State College for Women, published 193-.

The Buckman bill was the brainchild of H.H. Buckman, a legislator from Duval County, Florida.  The Buckman bill was hotly debated, one legislator said in debate: "I believe in coeducation.

<blockquote>
didn't merely standardize, consolidate and narrow opportunities for public higher education in Florida. It also inaugurated an era of new school gender practices. Right from the start, in fact, the Buckman Act's message to Florida's women was that the highest levels of educational attainment--the advanced degrees and professional schools of a "university education--would be reserved for white males attending the new all-male University of the State of Florida. White women, by contrast, had to settle for a "college." Furthermore, the Buckman Act mandated that the university would "teach...the fundamental laws and...the rights and duties of citizens ..." to its male students. The college, by contrast, would "teach...all the useful arts and sciences that may be necessary or appropriate."  A dual discourse had been laid out--one that framed education for white men as a matter of "citizenship" and education for white women as a matter of "usefulness".<ref name="Frontiers, Shira Birnbaum, 1996, p.8">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3687/is_199601/ai_n8735116/pg_1] ''Shira Birnbaum, "Making Southern belles in progressive era Florida: Gender in the formal and hidden curriculum of the Florida Female College", p. 8, ''Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies'', Vol. 16, No. 2/3, Gender, Nations, and Nationalisms (1996), pp. 218-246

=== College of Arts and Sciences ===
[[Image:Symbol_HeritageTower_0279_%28048%29.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Symbolic torches on Heritage Tower fountain]]
The College of [[Art]]s and [[Science]]s encompases the fields of social sciences, liberal arts, mathematics, sciences and interdisciplinary studies. Several academic programs enjoy national reputations. These include the Department of [[English language|English]], which boasts one of the nation's top [[creative writing]] programs; the [[Classics]] Department, which offers comprehensive programs ranging from analysis of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] literature to archeology; and several other programs, including the Departments of [[Geography]] and [[Oceanography]].

=====Biological Sciences=====
The Department of Biological Sciences includes world class faculty in cellular and molecular biology, [[computational biology]], evolution and ecology, and neuroscience.  The Department has embarked on an innovative new cluster hiring initiative that focuses on the integration of genotype and phenotype.  FSU's new Life Sciences Teaching and Research Building is a state-of-the-art facility that will provide over 90,000 net square feet of space for instruction, research, and support services. The design features rooftop research greenhouses and an open ground floor cloister for students, faculty, and staff. Other features include a 150 seat auditorium, biology teaching laboratories, and more than 30 research laboratories for the Department of Biological Science.

=====Chemistry and Biochemistry=====
[[Image:PacificYew 7591.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Pacific Yew]] tree - original source of [[Taxol]].  As Pacific yew trees were harvested for Taxol faster than they could grow back, a crisis emerged in the supply of a beneficial anti-cancer medication.  FSU's semisynthetic Taxol greatly improved the supply of this anti-cancer drug]]
Also working in the field of materials science and [[nanoscience]] at FSU is the [[Nobel laureate]] Sir [[Harry Kroto]], the co-discoverer of the C-60 '[[buckyball]]', who is a member of FSU's Chemistry and Biochemistry Department. Research in the Chemistry department currently spans fields ranging from analytical through organic, using experimental techniques and equipment including advanced [[lasers]], [[spectrometers]]<ref name="Florida State University Dept of Chemistry and Biochemistry">[http://www.chem.fsu.edu/facilities/fa_sl_laser.asp#equipment] ''Florida State University - Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Laser Facility Equipment Data'' Retrieved on [[May 3|5-03]]-[[2007]].</ref> and [[superconducting magnet]]s.  A new, 5-story 168,000 square foot chemistry building is currently under construction on the west side of FSU's campus; when complete, it will enhance the department's strengths in molecular recognition, materials, nanotechnology, biochemistry, molecular synthesis, [[computational chemistry]], and advanced measurement science as well as further support its robust Ph.D. and postdoctoral fellow training programs.

=====Taxol - anti-cancer drug=====
A significant achievement at the university was chemistry professor and synthetic organic chemist, [[Robert A. Holton]]'s synthesizing of [[Taxol]] on Dec. 9, 1993. The chemical has been used as an effective [[breast cancer]] and [[ovarian cancer]] treatment.

Dr. Holton and his organic chemistry team won a race to develop a cheaper semisynthetic version ([[Holton Taxol total synthesis]]). In 1993, [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] began marketing Taxol<U+00AE>, ultimately earning more than $1.6 billion by the year 2000. Just like other [[chemotherapy]] drugs, it had side effects, but it also prolonged lives, and in many cases caused a full remission of [[cancer]].<ref name="Florida State University Research in Review Fall 2002">[http://www.rinr.fsu.edu/fall2002/taxol.html] ''Florida State University, Research in Review, Fall 2002 '' Retrieved on [[May 3|5-03]]-[[2007]].</ref>
  
Before the drug company's exclusive license expired, Florida State earned $351 million in [[royalties]], vaulting the school into the ranks of [[Columbia University]] and [[University of California|California]]'s state universities in research profits.  By comparison, Taxol has earned Florida State more than three times what the popular beverage [[Gatorade]] earned the University of Florida.<ref name="St. Petersburg Times, April 30, 2004"> ''St. Petersburg Times, April 30, 2004, "From Campus to Commerce" by Robert Trigeaux'' Retrieved on [[May 3|5-03]]-[[2007]].[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/625889291.html?dids=625889291:625889291&FMT=FT&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Apr+30%2C+2004&author=ROBERT+TRIGAUX&pub=St.+Petersburg+Times&edition=&startpage=1.D&desc=FROM+CAMPUS+TO+COMMERCE+%2F%2F+Examining+labs%27+profit+potential+Series%3A+COLUMN]

====Seminoles - an unconquered people====

The school's athletic teams are called the [[Seminole (tribe)|Seminoles]].  [[List of sports team names derived from Indigenous peoples|This Native American name]] is used with official sanction of the Seminole Tribe of Florida, Inc. and the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma. They participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Division I]] (Division I-A for football) and in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]. Their traditional rivals include the [[University of Florida]] Gators and the [[University of Miami]] Hurricanes.

Under head coach [[Bobby Bowden]], currently in his 31st year, the Seminole football team became one of the nation's perennial powers, greatly expanding the tradition of football at Florida State.<ref name="Florida State University Seminoles.com-football">[http://seminoles.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/bowden_bobby01.html] ''Florida State University, Seminoles.com - Official Site of FSU Athletics, Profile: Bobby Bowden'' Retrieved on [[June 30|6-30]]-[[2007]].</ref> The Seminoles played in five national championship games between 1993  and [[2001]], and have claimed the championship twice, in 1993 and 1999 . The FSU football team was the most successful team in college football during the 1990s, boasting an 89% winning percentage. FSU also set an NCAA record for most consecutive Top 5 finishes in the [[Associated Press|AP]] football poll - receiving placement 14 years in a row, from 1987  to 2000. The Seminoles were the first college football team in history to go wire-to-wire (ranked first place from preseason to postseason) since the AP began releasing preseason rankings in 1936.  FSU also owns the record for most consecutive Bowl game victories with 11 between 1985 and 1996.<ref name="Florida State University Seminoles.com-football">[http://seminoles.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/bowden_bobby01.html] ''Florida State University, Seminoles.com - Official Site of FSU Athletics, Profile: Bobby Bowden'' Retrieved on [[June 30|6-30]]-[[2007]].</ref>

FSU head coach [[Bobby Bowden]] is the Division I college football coach leader in the NCAA with 366 career wins, followed by Penn State's [[Joe Paterno]] with 363.

In 2006, the FSU men's Track & Field team won the Atlantic Coast Conference championship, the NCAA East Regional championship and the NCAA National Championship.  Head Coach Bob Braman and Associate Head Coach Harlis Meaders helped lead individual champions in the 200 m (Walter Dix), the triple jump (Raqeef Curry), and the shot put ([[Garrett Johnson]]).  Individual runners-up were Walter Dix in the 100 m, Ricardo Chambers in the 400 m, and Tom Lancashire in the 1500 m.

==Traditions==
[[Image:Florida State rc01140.jpg|thumb|right|280px|1902 Florida State College football team]]The school's colors are [[Garnet]] and [[Gold (color)|Gold]]. The colors of Garnet and Gold represent a merging of the University's past.  While the school fielded a football team as early, or earlier than 1899<ref name="State Library and Archives of Florida - Florida Photographic Collection, West Florida Seminary Football Team, published 1899"> [http://fpc.dos.state.fl.us/general/n044028.jpg] ''State Library and Archives of Florida - Florida Photographic Collection, West Florida Seminary Football Team at College Hall, published 1899'' Retrieved on [[April 29|4-29]]-[[2007]].</ref>, in 1902, 1903 and 1905 the team won football championships wearing purple and gold uniforms.<ref name="Official History of Florida State University"> [http://www.fsu.edu/about/history.html] ''History of Florida State University, Office of the Dean of the Faculties, September 5, 2001'' Retrieved on [[April 29|4-29]]-[[2007]].</ref><ref name="The Argo of the Seminary West of the Suwanee"> [http://diglib.lib.fsu.edu/cgi-bin/ebind2html.pl/fs00000036?seq=33] ''The Argo of the Seminary West of the Suwanee, Tallahassee, FL (circa 1900), page 28 (image 33)'' Retrieved on [[May 8|5-08]]-[[2007]].</ref> When FSC became Florida State College for Women in 1905, the football team and fraternity system was forced to attend the now all male school in Gainesville, thus marking the beginning of the football program at the University of Florida.<ref name="FSU 150th Anniversary--History"> [http://www.fsu.edu/~fsu150/history/history_02_1851d.html] ''Florida State University Sesquicentennial Celebration 1851-2001, History 1851-1905 Student Life'' Retrieved on [[April 29|4-29]]-[[2007]] </ref> The following year, the college student body selected crimson as the official school color. The administration in 1905 took crimson and combined it with the recognizable purple of the championship football teams to achieve the color garnet.  When football returned to the school about 42 years later the now famous Garnet and Gold colors were first used on an FSU uniform in a 14-6 loss to [[Stetson University|Stetson University]] on October 18, 1947. [[Image:Rc01122.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Chemistry lab in 1900]] 

FSU is also the home of the esteemed [[Marching Chiefs]], the largest collegiate marching band in the world. The Marching Chiefs are the force behind the famous "[[War Chant]]"<ref name="Florida State University War Chant Video">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU-XXy99xVw] ''YouTube video clip, 36 second clip posted by fsu17 on 9/17/2006 - FSU War Chant'' Retrieved on [[May 11|5-11]]-[[2007]].</ref>.

===School songs===
Alma Mater - High Over Towering Pines: High over towering pines our voices swell, Praising those Gothic spires, we love so well.
Here sons and daughters stand, faithful and true, Hailing our alma mater, F.S.U.

Hymn to the Garnet and Gold: Here's a hymn to the Garnet and the Gold, ringing to the sky. Here's a song for the men and women bold. Sing with heads held high. Striving ere to seek to know, Fight for victory. Alma Mater, this our song to you. Echoes, F.S.U.

'''FSU Fight Song''' 
''You've got to fight, fight, fight, for FSU, You've got to scalp 'em Seminoles, You've got to win, win, win, win this game, And roll on down to make those goals, For FSU is on the warpath now, and at the battle's end she's great. So fight, fight, fight, fight for victory, the Seminoles of Florida State! F-L-O-R-I-D-A S-T-A-T-E! Florida State, Florida State, Florida State, Woooo!''

The fight song was written by Florida State music professor, Thomas Wright, who owns the rights to the song.<ref name="Florida State University Fight Song">[http://mailer.fsu.edu/~abrady/FSU/scene5.swf] ''Florida State University - Fight Song (lyrics by Doug Alley, music by Thomas Wright)'' Retrieved on [[May 25|5-25]]-[[2007]].</ref> Wright allows FSU to use the Fight Song every year in exchange for two season tickets.<ref name="Florida State University fight music">[http://community-2.webtv.net/@HH!9F!3E!646186E66FF9/The-Johnz/THEHISTORYOFTHEWAR/] ''The History of the War Chant'' Retrieved on [[May 25|5-25]]-[[2007]].</ref> According to Wright, the Native American profile often used as a symbol of FSU was also based on the profile of his face.

The 1950  Florida State University Homecoming half-time show included a dedication ceremony naming the stadium in honor of university President Doak Campbell. There was also a special performance by the band, christening it the [[Marching Chiefs]] and premiering the Florida State University Fight Song. 

Fifty years later, the FSU Fight Song is one of the most widely recognized college tunes in the country. [[Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] awakened alumnus and current professor [[Norm Thagard]], with the Fight Song one morning in 1983 while he was aboard the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]] [[spacecraft]].

===Campus media===
====Print media====
The '''FSView & Florida Flambeau''' is the campus newspaper of Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida. The paper focuses mainly on events that occur in and around the university. Most national news is relegated to a "News Briefs" section on the front page, below the fold. The paper publishes editions weekly during the summer and semiweekly on Mondays and Thursdays during the school year. The sections include News, Sports, Arts & Life, Classifieds, and Viewpoints, which includes an editorial cartoon, "Ink Globally, Act Locally" by cartoonist Mandy Newham. Special sections include NightLife, Bon Apetite, Rush and Dining Guide.

After changing hands three times in 13 years, the FSView was sold to the Tallahassee Democrat in late July 2006, making it part of the [[Gannett]] chain.

The FSView's production staff is also responsible for ''Edge Magazine''. Edge Magazine consists of articles geared towards students, advertisements for local establishments, and a "Tally Girl" model.
