'''Culbone''' (also called '''Kitnor''') is a [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] consisting of little more than the [[parish church]] and a few houses, in the parish of [[Oare, Somerset|Oare]] in the [[Exmoor National Park]], [[Somerset]], [[England]]. As there is no road access it is a two-mile walk from [[Porlock Weir]], and some four miles from [[Porlock]] itself. 

The village is situated in a sheltered spot, near the coast of Porlock Bay. The cliffs behind the village rise to the height of {{convert|1200|ft|m|0}}, over which a small stream falls down to the sea.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/SOM/Culbone/index.html |title=Culbone, Somerset |accessdate=2007-10-24 |format= |work=GENUKI }}</ref>

The [[South West Coast Path]] goes through the village, parts of which were closed and diverted in February 2007 following landslips in the woods.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk/print/index/news_2007/2007_feb_7.htm |title= Culbone Woods access restricted|accessdate=2007-10-24 |format= |work=Exmoor National Park }}</ref> The woods around the village are home to the rare ''[[Sorbus vexans]]'', a microspecies of self-cloning [[Sorbus]] trees which are only found in the coastal area between Culbone and [[Trentishoe]] in [[Devon]]. It is amongst the rarest trees in Britain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.treecouncil.org.uk/tnews/sorbus.htm |title=Britain's eleven rarest trees |accessdate=2007-10-24 |format= |work=UK Tree Council |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070731093236/http://www.treecouncil.org.uk/tnews/sorbus.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-07-31}}</ref> Other [[Whitebeam]] and [[Rowan]] species found in the area include; ''Sorbus subcuneata'', ''Sorbus <U+2018>Taxon D<U+2019>'' and ''Sorbus aucuparia''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chester |first=Michael |authorlink= |coauthors=Robyn S.

== History ==
Culbone was listed in the [[Domesday book]] as Kytenore,<ref>{{cite book |last=Savage |first= James|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=History of the Hundred of Carhampton |year=1830 |publisher=Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, & Green |location= |isbn= }}</ref> or Chetnore.<ref>{{cite book |last=Robinson |first= Stephen |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Somerset Place Names |year=1992 |publisher=Dovecote Press |location=Wimborne, Dorset |isbn=1-874336-03-2 }}</ref>  The name "Culbone" is thought to derive from the Celtic ''cil beun''' for "Church of St Beuno"<ref>''St Beuno's Church, Culbone'', leaflet on the history of the church, no author, no publisher, no date, page 4; leaflet acquired on site, 4 February 2011</ref>.  

The Culbone Stone, an early [[medi<U+00E6>val]] standing stone approximately one metre in height. It lies in woodland close to the parish boundary, and features an incised wheeled cross, the style of which suggests it dates from 7th to 9th century. The stone is legally protected as a [[scheduled ancient monument]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=4129 |title=Culbone Stone |accessdate=2007-10-24 |format= |work=Megalithic Portal }}</ref> It has been suggested that the stone has been moved from its original site as part of the Culbone Hill Stone Row.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/6805/culbone_stone.html |title= Culbone Stone|accessdate=2007-10-24 |format= |work=The Modern Antiquarian }}</ref>

Culbone woods were once the site of a major [[charcoal]] burning industry. The original burners were reputed to be a colony of [[lepers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.everythingexmoor.org.uk/_C/Culbone.php |title=Culbone |accessdate=2007-10-24 |format= |work=Everything Exmoor }}</ref>

Culbone was a [[civil parish]] until 1933 when, because of the small population (43 in 1931) it was merged into the parish of [[Oare, Somerset|Oare]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp;jsessionid=F56525645B6EE4E9C1C0EF22DFA356FD?u_id=10428014 |title=Culbone |accessdate=2007-10-24 |format= |work=Vision of Britain }}</ref>

Culbone Cottage, Culbone Lodge, and the Parsonage Farmhouse are all Grade II [[listed buildings]].

Culbone Church is said to be the smallest parish church in England.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.somerset.gov.uk/archives/ASH/Parishchs.htm |title=Parish Churches |accessdate=2007-10-24 |format= |work=Somerset County archives }}</ref> The chancel is {{convert|13.5|ft|m|1 }} x {{convert|10|ft|m|1}}, the nave
{{convert|21.5|ft|m|1}} x {{convert|12.33|ft|m|1}} and the building has a total length of {{convert|35|ft|m|1}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.minehead-online.co.uk/culbone.htm |title=Culbone |accessdate=2007-10-24 |format= |work=Minehead Online }}</ref> It seats about 30 and is dedicated to St [[Beuno]]. Services are still held there, despite the lack of road access. The church is probably pre-Norman in origin, with a 13th-century porch, and late 15th-century [[nave]]. It was refenestrated and reroofed around 1810 and the spirelet added in 1888. It underwent further restoration in 1928. It has been designated by [[English Heritage]] as a Grade I [[listed building]].<ref>{{cite web | title= Culbone church | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=265441 | accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref>

== Samuel Taylor Coleridge ==

The [[Person from Porlock]] is believed to have disturbed [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] during his composition of the oriental poem ''[[Kubla Khan]]''. Coleridge was living at [[Coleridge Cottage]], [[Nether Stowey]] (between [[Bridgwater]] and [[Minehead]]). It is likely that this encounter took place while he was staying at Ash Farm in Culbone.<ref>{{cite news |first=Penelope |last=Lively |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Exmoors rural ways and byways |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E4D8113FF93BA2575AC0A962958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print |work=New York Times |publisher= |date=1994-09-18 |accessdate=2007-10-24 }}</ref>
It is also possible that Coleridge composed the poem at the Culbone Parsonage near to Ash Farm, now a collection of holiday cottages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/524.html|title=Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834)|publisher=Representative Poetry Online|accessdate=3 January 2010}}</ref>
