The '''1984 United States men's Olympic basketball team''' competed in the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]], representing the [[United States]].  The team, coached by [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana Hoosiers]] coach [[Bob Knight]], won the gold medal.  It was the last amateur U.S. team to win an Olympic gold medal in men's basketball.  The Olympic tournament was notable in that many [[Eastern Bloc]] countries opted to boycott the games in retaliation of the United States' [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow.

== Olympic trials ==

Trials for the team were held in April 1984 on the campus of [[Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana]].  Seventy players attended the trials.  [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] post players [[Sam Bowie]] and [[Melvin Turpin]] chose to skip the trials to concentrate on the upcoming [[1984 NBA Draft]],<ref>{{cite web| last =| first =| title =Bowie, Turpin to Skip | publisher =''TheDaily Times''| date =April 14, 1984| url =http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bKpeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=F1MNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2391,1114495&dq=melvin+turpin+olympic&hl=en | accessdate = August 18, 2012}}</ref> and [[Keith Lee]] of [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis State]], [[Len Bias]] of [[Maryland Terrapins men's basketball|Maryland]] and [[Kenny Smith]] of [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] ultimately pulled out as well.<ref>{{cite web| last =| first =| title =Olympic Cage Quest | publisher =''TheDaily Times''| date =April 14, 1984| url =http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uRhZAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ckYNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4513,4868387&dq=kenny+smith+olympic&hl=en | accessdate = August 18, 2012}}</ref>  Knight led the trials with assistant coaches [[George Raveling]], [[Don Donoher]] and [[C.

During the trials, [[Auburn Tigers men's basketball|Auburn]] junior [[Charles Barkley]] impressed with his performance - most observers felt he and North Carolina guard [[Michael Jordan]] were the two top performers.  However, Barkley's and Knight's strong personalities did not mesh and Barkley was one of the last cuts for the roster.<ref name=BONDY>{{cite book|last=Bondy |first=Filip |year=2007 |title=Tip-Off: How the 1984 NBA Draft Changed Basketball Forever|publisher=DaCapo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81486-0}}</ref> Released with Barkley in the penultimate cut from 20 to 16 players in May were [[John Stockton]], [[Terry Porter]], and [[Maurice Martin]].<ref name=bsiofs>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H1hWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9u4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6603%2C8983107 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |last=Blanchette|title=Basketball school is over for Stockton |date=May 14, 1984 |page=13 }}</ref> Knight's final cut to twelve players came in June, and the final four let go were [[Tim McCormick]], [[Lancaster Gordon]], [[Johnny Dawkins]], and [[Chuck Person]] (Dawkins and Person served as alternates for the team).<ref>{{cite web| last =| first =| title =Knight Makes Up His Mind Early, Announces Olympic Cage Squad | publisher =''TheDaily Times''| date =June 28, 1984| url =http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4c8pAAAAIBAJ&sjid=s8kEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1422,6931392&dq=johnny+dawkins+chuck+person+olympics&hl=en | accessdate = August 18, 2012}}</ref>  The most controversial selection was Knight's own player, [[Steve Alford]], who at 19 was the team's youngest player and who most did not expect to make the team.<ref name=HOOPS/>

== Legacy ==

The 1984 Olympics was a coming out party for Michael Jordan, who led the U. S. team in scoring and dazzled the worldwide viewing audience with his athletecism and speed.  In addition to Jordan, the team featured two other future [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] in Patrick Ewing and Chris Mullin (who would later reunite with Jordan as a part of the [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|1992 Dream Team]]).  The team was considered one of the strongest in U. S. history as it featured four of the five [[1984 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|1984 consensus first team All-Americans]] - Jordan, Ewing, Tisdale and [[Sam Perkins]].<ref name=HOOPS/> Jordan recalled that while this Olympic experience was exciting, it had been difficult because of Knight. "I don't know if I would have done it if I knew what Knight was going to be like" he would be quoted later. <ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=zilYagKLBM0C&pg=PA207&lpg=PA207&dq=bobby+knight+%22the+jordan+rules%22+olympics&source=bl&ots=hTBvyOY_9e&sig=yHYFpZ0RmX6H9njLPnSHTsHzJTI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=d5jiUKTmCo-w0QGyroCIBQ&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=bobby%20knight%20%22the%20jordan%20rules%22%20olympics&f=false pg.207</ref>

The Olympics and trials helped the draft stock of several players.  [[Vern Fleming]] and [[Jeff Turner]] parlayed their Olympic exposure into first round spots in the 1984 draft, while several players cut from the team either received strong recommendations from Knight ([[John Stockton]], Tim McCormick) or benefitted from exposure from the trials (Barkley, Lancaster Gordon).<ref name=BONDY/>
