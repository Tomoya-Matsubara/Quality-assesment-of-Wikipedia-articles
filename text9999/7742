{{nihongo|'''''Yakumo'''''|<U+516B><U+96F2>||sometimes transliterated as ''Yagumo''}} was an [[armored cruiser]] built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) in the late 1890s. As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself, the ship was built in [[German Empire|Germany]]. She participated in most of the naval battles of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904<U+2013>05, and was lightly damaged during the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea]] and the [[Battle of Tsushima]]. ''Yakumo'' saw no combat during World War I and began the first of many training cruises in 1917, although she was not officially reclassified as a [[training ship]] until 1931. Her last training cruise was in 1939, but the ship continued to conduct training in home waters throughout the [[Pacific War]]. ''Yakumo'' became a [[repatriation]] transport after the war and was [[ship breaking|broken up]] in 1946<U+2013>47.

==Background and design==
The 1896 Naval Expansion Plan was made after the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], and included four armored cruisers in addition to four more battleships, all of which had to be ordered from overseas shipyards as Japan lacked the capability to build them itself. Further consideration of the Russian building program caused the IJN to believe that the battleships ordered under the original plan would not be sufficient to counter the [[Imperial Russian Navy]]. Budgetary limitations prevented ordering more battleships, and the IJN decided to expand the number of more affordable armored cruisers to be ordered from four to six ships, believing that the recent introduction of tougher [[Krupp cemented armor]] would allow them to stand in the [[line of battle]]. The revised plan is commonly known as the "Six-Six Fleet". The first four ships were built by [[Armstrong Whitworth]] in the United Kingdom, but the last two ships were built in Germany and France. To ensure [[ammunition]] compatiblity, the IJN required their builders to use the same British guns as the other four ships.<ref>Evans & Peattie, pp. 57<U+2013>62</ref> In general, the IJN provided only a sketch design and specifications that each builder had to comply with; otherwise each builder was free to build the ships as they saw fit. Unlike most of their contemporaries which were designed for [[commerce raiding]] or to defend colonies and trade routes, ''Yakumo'' and her half-[[sister ship|sister]]s were intended as fleet scouts and to be employed in the [[line of battle|battleline]].<ref>Milanovich, p. 72</ref>

==Description==
[[File:Japanese armored cruiser Yakumo left elevation plan.jpg|thumb|left|Left elevation and plan of ''Yakumo'' from [[Jane's Fighting Ships]] 1904]]
The ship was {{convert|132.3|m|ftin|sp=us}} long [[length overall|overall]] and {{convert|124.64|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[Length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]]. She had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|19.57|m|ftin|sp=us}} and had an average [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|7.21|m|ftin|sp=us}}. ''Yakumo'' [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|9646|t|LT|sp=us}} at normal load and {{convert|10288|t|LT|sp=us}} at [[deep load]]. The ship had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|0.95|m|ftin|sp=us}}. She had a [[double bottom]] and her hull was subdivided into 247 [[watertight compartments]].<ref>Milanovich, pp. 74, 80</ref> Her crew consisted of 670 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=j3>Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 73</ref>

''Yakumo'' had two 4-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple-expansion steam engine]]s, each driving a single [[propeller shaft]].<ref>Milanovich, p. 81</ref> Steam for the engines was provided by 24 [[Belleville boiler]]s and the engines were rated at a total of {{convert|15500|ihp|lk=on}}. The ship had a designed speed of {{convert|20|kn|lk=in}} and reached {{convert|21.005|kn}} during her [[sea trial]]s from {{convert|16960|ihp|abbr=on}}. She carried up to {{convert|1300|t|sp=us}} of coal and could steam for {{convert|7000|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref>Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, pp. 73<U+2013>74</ref>

===Armament===
The [[main battery|main armament]] for all of the "Six-Six Fleet" armored cruisers was four Armstrong Whitworth-built 45-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] [[20.3 cm/45 Type 41 naval gun|eight-inch guns]] in twin-[[gun turret]]s fore and aft of the [[superstructure]]. The electrically operated turrets were capable of 130<U+00B0> rotation left and right, and the guns could be elevated to +30<U+00B0> and depressed to <U+2212>5<U+00B0>. The turret accommodated 65 [[Shell (projectile)|shells]], but could only be reloaded through doors in the turret floor and the ship's [[deck (ship)|deck]] that allowed the electric [[winch]] in the turret to hoist shells up from the shell room deep in the hull.<ref>Milanovich, pp. 76<U+2013>77</ref> The ship carried a total of 320 eight-inch shells.<ref name=Conway/> The guns were manually loaded and had a rate of fire about 1.2 [[Cartridge (firearms)|rounds]] per minute. The 203-millimeter gun fired {{convert|113.5|kg|adj=on|sp=us}} [[armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing (AP)]] projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|760|m/s|sp=us}} to a range of {{convert|18000|m|yd|sp=us}}.<ref>Milanovich, p. 78</ref>

The [[Battleship secondary armament|secondary armament]] consisted of a dozen [[Elswick Ordnance Company]] "Pattern Z" [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF)]], 40-caliber, 6-inch guns. Only four of these guns were not mounted in armored [[casemate]]s on the main and upper decks, and their mounts on the upper deck were protected by [[gun shield]]s. Their {{convert|100|lb|kg|1||disp=flip}} AP shells were fired at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2300|ft/s|m/s|disp=flip|sp=us}}.<ref>Friedman, p. 276; Milanovich, p. 78</ref> The guns were provided with 150 rounds each.<ref name=Conway/> ''Yakumo'' was also equipped with a dozen 40-caliber [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|QF 12-pounder 12-cwt guns]]<ref group=Note>"Cwt" is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.</ref> and eight QF 2.5-pounder [[Hotchkiss gun|Yamauchi guns]] as close-range defense against [[torpedo boat]]s.<ref>Milanovich, p. 78</ref> The former gun fired {{convert|3|in|adj=on|0|disp=flip|sp=us}}, {{convert|12.5|lb|adj=on|disp=flip|sp=us}} projectiles at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2359|ft/s|m/s|disp=flip|sp=us}}.<ref>Friedman, p. 114</ref>

''Yakumo'' was equipped with five {{convert|457|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s, one above water in the bow and four submerged tubes, two on each [[broadside]]. The Type 30 torpedo had a {{convert|100|kg|sp=us|adj=on}} [[warhead]] and three range/speed settings: {{convert|800|m|yd|sp=us}} at {{convert|27|kn}}, {{convert|1000|m|yd|sp=us}} at {{convert|23.6|kn}} or {{convert|3000|m|yd|sp=us}} at {{convert|14.2|kn}}.<ref>Milanovich, p. 80</ref>

===Armor===
All of the "Six-Six Fleet" armored cruisers used the same armor scheme with some minor differences, one of which was that the four later ships all used Krupp cemented armor. The [[Belt armor|waterline belt]] ran the full length of the ship and its thickness varied from {{convert|178|mm|in|sp=us}} amidships to {{convert|89|mm|in|sp=us}} at the bow and stern. It had a height of {{convert|2.13|m|ftin|sp=us}}, of which {{convert|1.49|m|ftin|sp=us}} was normally underwater. The upper [[strake]] of belt armor was {{convert|127|mm|in|sp=us}} thick and extended from the upper edge of the waterline belt to the main deck. It extended {{convert|61.49|m|ftin|sp=us}} from the forward to the rear [[barbette]]. ''Yakumo'' had only a single transverse 127&nbsp;mm armored [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] that closed off the forward end of the central armored citadel.<ref>Milanovich, pp. 80<U+2013>81</ref>

The barbettes, gun turrets and the front of the casemates were all {{convert|152|mm|in|sp=us}} thick while the sides and rear of the casemates were protected by {{convert|127|mm|in|sp=us}} of armor. The deck was {{convert|63|mm|in|sp=us}} thick and the armor protecting the [[conning tower]] was {{convert|356|mm|in|sp=us}} in thickness.<ref name=Conway>Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 224</ref>

==Construction and career==
[[File:Japanese cruiser Yakumo on completion.jpg|thumb|''Yakumo'' at anchor, 1900]]
''Yakumo'', named from a stanza of the [[Waka (poetry)|''waka'' poem]] by [[Susanoo]] in the [[Japanese mythology]],<ref>Masahide, p. 98, also, Yakumo is another name of the {{nihongo|Cloud iridescence|<U+745E><U+96F2> or <U+5F69><U+96F2>,|Zuiun or Saiun}}.</ref><ref>Daiji, p. 219</ref> was ordered on 1 September 1897 and [[keel laying|laid down]] a year later by [[AG Vulcan Stettin]] in [[Stettin]], Germany. The ship was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 8 July 1899 and completed on 20 June 1900. She departed Stettin two days later and arrived in [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]], Japan, on 30 August.<ref>Milanovich, p. 73</ref>

===Russo-Japanese War===
At the start of the Russo-Japanese War, ''Yakumo'' was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet.<ref>Kowner, p. 465</ref> She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904, when [[Vice Admiral]] [[T<U+014D>g<U+014D> Heihachir<U+014D>]] led the [[Combined Fleet]] in an attack on the Russian ships of the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Squadron]] anchored just outside [[L<U+00FC>shunkou District|Port Arthur]]. T<U+014D>g<U+014D> had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the [[protected cruiser]] {{ship|Russian cruiser|Boyarin|1901|2}}, which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russians. T<U+014D>g<U+014D> chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese eight- and six-inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect.<ref>Forczyk, pp. 42<U+2013>43</ref> Although many ships on both sides were hit, Russian casualties numbered some 150, while the Japanese suffered roughly 90 killed and wounded before T<U+014D>g<U+014D> disengaged.<ref>Corbett, I, p. 105</ref> ''Yakumo'' was not hit during the engagement, although she did hit the protected cruiser {{ship|Russian cruiser|Novik|1900|2}} one time with an eight-inch shell.<ref>Warner & Warner, p. 200</ref>

In early March, Vice Admiral [[Kamimura Hikonoj<U+014D>]] was tasked to take the reinforced 2nd Division north and make a diversion off [[Vladivostok]]. While scouting for Russian ships in the area, the Japanese cruisers bombarded the harbor and defenses of Vladivostok on 6 March to little effect. Upon their return to Japan a few days later, the 2nd Division was ordered to escort the transports ferrying the [[Imperial Guards Division]] to Korea and then to join the ships blockading Port Arthur. ''Yakumo'' was then transferred to [[Rear Admiral]] [[Dewa Shiget<U+014D>]]'s 3rd Division. On 23 June, the ship was Dewa's flagship<ref>Corbett, I, pp. 138<U+2013>39, 142<U+2013>45, 160, 177, 208, 294</ref> when the Pacific Squadron [[sortie]]d in an abortive attempt to reach Vladivostok, but the new squadron commander, Rear Admiral [[Wilgelm Vitgeft]], ordered the squadron to return to Port Arthur when it encountered the Japanese [[battleline]] shortly before sunset, as he did not wish to engage his numerically superior opponents in a night battle.<ref>Warner & Warner, pp. 305<U+2013>06</ref>

====Battle of the Yellow Sea====
{{main|Battle of the Yellow Sea}}
[[File:Japanese cruiser Yakumo.jpg|thumb|Japanese postcard of ''Yakumo'', circa 1905]]
On the morning of 10 August 1904, Dewa's cruisers were over {{convert|15|nmi}} south of T<U+014D>g<U+014D>'s 1st Division when the Russians sortied from Port Arthur in another attempt to reach Vladivostok. In the early stages of the battle, Dewa attempted to engage the Russian cruisers trailing the battleships in accordance with T<U+014D>g<U+014D>'s standing orders, but was rebuffed by fire from the battleships. As Dewa closed with the Russians later in the afternoon in another attempt to attack the Russian cruisers, a {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on|sp=us|0}} shell struck ''Yakumo'' amidships at 15:40, killing 12 and wounding 11. The range at this time exceeded {{convert|8|nmi}}, beyond the range of any gun in his squadron, so Dewa ordered his ships to disengage. By 17:45, ''Yakumo'' had maneuvered to about {{convert|8000|or|9000|m|yd|sp=us}} from the damaged Russian battleship [[Russian battleship Poltava (1894)|''Poltava'']] and opened fire. ''Yakumo'' continued to close until the Russian squadron was thrown into confusion by the death of Vitgeft around 18:40.<ref>Corbett, I, pp. 383<U+2013>84, 388, 391, 393</ref>

The 3rd Division then followed T<U+014D>g<U+014D>'s ships as they circled the Russian ships while they sorted themselves out, now firing at the Russian cruisers with little effect, until T<U+014D>g<U+014D> ordered Dewa to attack the Russian [[destroyer]]s at about 19:44. Dewa cancelled that last order and turned south around 20:00 in pursuit of several Russian cruisers that were fleeing to the south, in an attempt to intercept them before they reached the isolated flotillas of destroyers and torpedo boats. The Russian ships were engaged by other Japanese cruisers before they could reach the small ships, and Dewa broke off the pursuit around 20:25 as light was fading. He continued south-eastwards overnight and spotted one cruiser and two destroyers, but was unable to catch any of them. On 14 August, ''Yakumo'' and the 3rd Division was ordered to [[Tsingtao]] to confirm that the Germans had indeed interned the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Tsesarevich||2}} and three destroyers that had taken shelter there after the battle. After their return, they were reassigned to the blockade of Port Arthur.<ref>Corbett, I, pp. 398, 401<U+2013>03, 417<U+2013>19, 456, 458</ref>

In mid-September, ''Yakumo'' was transferred back to Kamimura's 2nd Division, which was defending the [[Strait of Tsushima]], although she began a refit at the end of the month. The ship returned to Dewa on 15 November and he transferred his flag back to her. On 13 December, the ship attempted to rescue survivors of the {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Takasago||2}} after she had struck a mine, but found no one still living. ''Yakumo'' was sent to [[Sasebo Naval Arsenal]] for another refit five days later. On 1 February 1905, the ship was ordered to join Rear Admiral [[Shimamura Hayao]]'s 2nd Division blockading Vladivostok, although this only lasted for a few weeks as she was ordered to [[Kure Naval Arsenal]] for a final refit in mid-February before the anticipated battle with the Russian ships sent from the [[Baltic Fleet]].<ref>Corbett, II, pp. 47, 55<U+2013>56, 96<U+2013>97, 113, 128, 159, 162</ref>

====Battle of Tsushima====
{{main|Battle of Tsushima}}

As the Russian [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|2nd and 3rd Pacific Squadrons]] approached Japan on 27 May, having sailed from the [[Baltic Sea]], ''Yakumo'' was assigned to Kamimura's 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet. The Russians were spotted by patrolling Japanese ships early that morning, but visibility was limited and radio reception poor. The preliminary reports were enough to cause T<U+014D>g<U+014D> to order his ships to put to sea and the 2nd Division spotted the Russian ships under the command of Vice Admiral [[Zinovy Rozhestvensky]] at around 11:30. Kamimura closed to about a range of 8000 meters before sheering off under fire to join T<U+014D>g<U+014D>'s battleships.<ref>Corbett, II, pp. 232, 235</ref> ''Yakumo'' was fourth of six when T<U+014D>g<U+014D> opened fire on the 2nd Pacific Squadron at 14:10 and, like most of the ships in the division, engaged the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Oslyabya||2}} which was forced to fall out of formation at 14:50 and sank 20 minutes later. By this time the Russian formation was in disorder and the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Knyaz Suvorov||2}} suddenly appeared out of the mist at 15:35 at a range of about {{convert|2000|m|sp=us}}. All of Kamimura's ships engaged her for five minutes or so, with ''Yakumo'' and the armored cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Azuma||2}} also firing torpedoes at the Russian ship without effect.<ref>Campbell, Part 2, pp. 128<U+2013>32</ref>

After 17:30 Kamimura led his division in a fruitless pursuit of some of the Russian cruisers, leaving T<U+014D>g<U+014D>'s battleships to their own devices. He abandoned his chase around 18:03 and turned northwards to rejoin T<U+014D>g<U+014D>. His ships spotted the rear of the Russian battleline around 18:30 and opened fire when the range closed to 8000<U+2013>9000 meters. Nothing is known of any effect on the Russians, and they ceased fire by 19:30 and rejoined T<U+014D>g<U+014D> at 20:08 as night was falling.<ref>Campbell, Part 3, pp. 186<U+2013>87</ref> The surviving Russian ships were spotted the next morning and the Japanese ships opened fire around 10:30, staying beyond the range at which the Russian ships could effectively reply. Rear Admiral [[Nikolai Nebogatov]] therefore decided to surrender his ships, as he could neither return fire nor close the range.<ref>Corbett, II, pp. 319<U+2013>20</ref>

In the meantime, the [[coast defense ship]] {{ship|Russian coast defense ship|Admiral Ushakov||2}} had fallen well behind Nebogatov's ships and was spotted by the protected cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Chiyoda||2}} early in the morning, but the Japanese were more intent on locating the main body of the Russian fleet than attacking a single isolated ship. ''Admiral Ushakov'' was then spotted at 14:10, well after Nebogatov's surrender, by Shimamura who received permission to pursue her with his flagship, the armored cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Iwate||2}}, and ''Yakumo''. They caught up with the Russian ship at 17:00 and demanded her surrender. ''Admiral Ushakov'' attempted to close the range to bring the Japanese cruisers within range of her guns, but they were fast enough to keep the range open and the Russian ship never hit either one. After about half an hour, ''Admiral Ushakov'' was listing heavily enough that her guns could not elevate enough to bear, and her commander ordered his crew to abandon ship and the [[scuttling]] charges detonated. The ship sank in three minutes and 12 officers and 327 crewmen were rescued by the Japanese. Between them, ''Yakumo'' and ''Iwate'' fired 89 eight- and 278 six-inch shells during the engagement.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 64<U+2013>65</ref> Over the course of the entire battle, ''Yakumo'' was struck by a single twelve-inch shell and six others, of which three or four were six inches in size. They inflicted only minor damage.<ref>Campbell, Part 4, p. 263</ref>

On 14 June, ''Yakumo'' was assigned as the flagship of Vice Admiral [[Kataoka Shichir<U+014D>]], commander of the [[3rd Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|3rd Fleet]], as part of the operation to capture the island of [[Sakhalin]] in July.<ref>Corbett, II, p. 357</ref>

===World War I===
In November 1914, ''Yakumo'' was deployed to [[Singapore]] preparatory to searching for the German commerce raider {{SMS|Emden|1906|2}}, but the ship was sunk before the mission began.<ref>Halpern, p. 75</ref> ''Yakumo'' served as the flagship of Destroyer Squadron (''Suiraisentai'') 2 from 13 December 1915 to 1 December 1916 and then of ''Suiraisentai'' 1 from 1 to 12 December.<ref>Lacroix & Wells, p. 552</ref> In February 1917, the ship began patrolling the South Pacific and Indian Oceans, searching for German commerce raiders.<ref>Saxon</ref> She began the first of her many training cruises on 5 April when she departed for North America and [[Hawaii]], before arriving back in Japan on 17 August.<ref name=lw7>Lacroix & Wells, p. 657</ref> In October 1918, [[Kichisabur<U+014D> Nomura]] was appointed [[captain (nautical)|captain]] of ''Yakumo'' for two months, only one of which he spent on board the vessel, as a political appointment to qualify Nomura for flag rank.<ref>Mauch, p. 59</ref>

===Interwar years===
On 1 September 1921, ''Yakumo'' was re-designated as a 1st class [[Kaibokan|coast-defense ship]] and used primarily for training duties in long-distance oceanic navigation and officer training for cadets in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Academy]]. In this capacity, she participated in 13 more voyages in the 1920s and 1930s to [[Europe]], North and [[South America]], and the [[Oceania|South Pacific]],<ref>Lacroix & Wells, pp. 657<U+2013>58</ref> including a circumnavigation of the globe from August 1921 to April 1922, in company with the armored cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Izumo||2}}.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000329/19211129/053/0005|title=World Cruise|date=29 November 1921|work=Western Morning News|page=5|accessdate=11 April 2015| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}</ref> Two of the naval cadets that participated in this cruise were Princes [[Prince Kuni Asaakira|Kuni Asaakira]] and [[Prince Kach<U+014D> Hirotada|Kach<U+014D> Hirotada]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9801E0DE103EEE3ABC4051DFB667838A639EDE|title=Japanese Cruisers Here With Cadets|work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 April 2015|date=28 October 1921}}</ref>

[[File:Yakumo SLV H91.325 1051.jpg|thumb|''Yakumo'' at anchor in Australia during her 1928 cadet cruise]]
In 1924, four of ''Yakumo''{{'}}s 12-pounder guns were removed, as were all of her QF 2.5-pounder guns, and a single [[8 cm/40 3rd Year Type naval gun|8&nbsp;cm/40 3rd Year Type]] [[anti-aircraft gun]] was added. In addition three of her torpedo tubes were removed.<ref>Chesneau, p. 174</ref> Three years later, her boilers were replaced by six [[Yarrow boiler]]s, formerly from the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Haruna||2}}, which reduced her power to {{convert|7000|ihp|abbr=on}} and maximum speed to {{convert|16|kn}}. These boilers used a mix of coal and [[fuel oil]], and the ship now carried a total of {{convert|1210|t|LT|sp=us}} of coal and {{convert|306|t|LT|sp=us}} of oil.<ref name=j4>Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 74</ref>

During a visit to Tsingtao in 1930, ''Yakumo'' and ''Izumo'' had to land marines on 13 January to quell a riot by Japanese residents there.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/90910705?searchTerm=cruiser%20yakumo&searchLimits=l-decade=193|title=Chinese Town in State of Dread|work=The Adelaide Courier|page=20|language=21 January 1932|accessdate=11 April 2015}}</ref> The following year, the ship was reclassified as a training ship.<ref name=hs/> On 6 November 1936, between the islands of [[Saipan]] and [[Chuuk State|Truk]], an accidental explosion in her front [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] killed four crewmen and flooded her front food locker.

After the start of the Pacific War, ''Yakumo'' was reclassified as a 1st class cruiser on 1 July 1942, and her eight-inch guns were replaced by four [[12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval gun|{{convert|12.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} Type 89]] [[dual-purpose gun]]s in two twin mounts. In addition her light anti-aircraft armament was augmented. However, ''Yakumo'' remained within the confines of the [[Seto Inland Sea]] throughout the war as she was assigned to training duties, and was not used in any combat operations. She was stricken from the [[navy list]] on 1 October 1945. ''Yakumo'' began service as a repatriation transport on 7 December. Her mission was to return troops and civilians to the home islands from Japan's former overseas possessions, primarily from [[Taiwan]] and mainland China. She completed her last voyage in June 1946, repatriating a total of 9,010 people. ''Yakumo'' arrived at the [[Maizuru, Kyoto|Maizuru]] shipyard of [[Hitachi Zosen|Hitachi Shipbuilding & Engineering]] on 20 July 1946 to begin demolition that lasted until 1 April 1947.<ref name=hs>Hackett & Kingsepp</ref>
