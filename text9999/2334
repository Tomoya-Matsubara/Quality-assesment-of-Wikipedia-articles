'''Hugh de Neville''' (died 1234; sometimes '''Hugh Neville'''<ref name=Warren190/>) was the Chief Forester under the kings [[Richard I of England|{{nowrap|Richard I}}]], [[John of England|John]], and [[Henry III of England|{{nowrap|Henry III}}]] of England. He was also the [[sheriff]] for a number of counties over his lifetime. Related to a number of other royal officials as well as a bishop, de Neville was a member of Prince Richard's household. After Richard became king in 1189 de Neville continued in his service, and accompanied him on the [[Third Crusade]]. De Neville remained in royal service following Richard's death in 1199 and the ascension of King John to the throne, becoming one of the new king's favourites and often gambling with him. He was named in ''[[Magna Carta]]'' as one of John's principal advisors, considered by a medieval chronicler to be one of King John's "evil councillors".<ref name=List/> He deserted John after the French invasion of England in 1216, but returned to pledge his loyalty to John's son {{nowrap|Henry III}} after the latter's accession to the throne later that year. De Neville continued his royal service until late in his life, dying in 1234.

==Early life and career==

De Neville was the son of Ralph de Neville, a son of [[Alan de Neville]], who was also Chief Forester.<ref name=Nevillexi/> Hugh had a brother, [[Roger de Neville]], who was part of Hugh's household from 1202 to 1213, when Roger was given custody of [[Rockingham Castle]] by King John.<ref name=Neville30/> Another brother was William, who was given some of Hugh's lands in 1217.<ref name=Neville31/> Hugh, Roger, and William were related to a number of other royal officials and ecclesiastics, most notable among them [[Geoffrey de Neville]], who was a [[Chamberlain (office)|royal chamberlain]] and [[Ralph Neville]], who became [[Bishop of Chichester]].<ref name=Neville18/> Hugh de Neville employed Ralph de Neville at the start of Ralph's career, and the two appear to have remained on good terms throughout the rest of Hugh's life.<ref name=Neville79>Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' p. 79</ref>

Hugh de Neville was a member of the household of Prince Richard, later {{nowrap|Richard I}},<ref name=Neville24/> and also served Richard's father King [[Henry II of England|{{nowrap|Henry II}}]] at the end of Henry's reign, administering two baronies for the king.<ref name=DNB>Crook "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19942 Neville, Hugh de (d. 1234)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> De Neville accompanied Richard on the [[Third Crusade]]; he was one of the few knights who fought with the king on 5&nbsp;August 1192 outside the walls of [[Jaffa]], when the king and a small force of knights and crossbowmen fought off a surprise attack by [[Saladin]]'s forces. It was famously reported that during the engagement Saladin sent Richard two remounts in the thick of battle, so that Richard would not be forced to fight on foot.<ref name=Gillingham215>Gillingham ''Richard I'' pp. 215<U+2013>216</ref> De Neville's account of events was a source for the chronicler [[Ralph of Coggeshall]]'s entries on Richard's activities in the Third Crusade.<ref name=Neville24>Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' pp. 24<U+2013>25</ref>{{efn|The later medieval writer [[Matthew Paris]] recorded a colourful story about de Neville encountering a lion while on crusade. This story may have been made up by Paris from the fact that de Neville used a lion on his seal, since no earlier writer mentions this story.<ref name=DNB/>}}

In 1194 de Neville acquired the [[wardship]] of Joan de Cornhill, daughter of [[Henry de Cornhill (sheriff)|Henry de Cornhill]], and married her four years later. He was given custody of the town of [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] in 1194,<ref name=Neville25>Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' pp. 25<U+2013>26</ref> and in 1196 was named as [[High Sheriff of Oxfordshire|Sheriff of Oxfordshire]].<ref name=Neville18>Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' pp. 18<U+2013>19</ref> He was also named in 1197 as [[High Sheriff of Essex|Sheriff of Essex]] and [[High Sheriff of Hertfordshire|Sheriff of Hertfordshire]], offices he held until some time in 1200.<ref name=DNB/>

==Chief Forester==
[[File:Magna Carta.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A 1215 copy of ''[[Magna Carta]]'', which records de Neville as one of the royal councillors]]

De Neville was appointed Chief Forester under King Richard I<ref name=Turner45>Turner ''King John'' p. 45</ref> in 1198.<ref name=Young38>Young ''Royal Forests'' p. 38</ref> As the official in charge of the [[royal forest]]s, de Neville was one of the four great officers of the state: the others were the justiciar, the chancellor, and the treasurer. The forester was responsible for enforcing the [[forest law]]&nbsp;<U+2013> the special law that applied to the royal forests&nbsp;{{efn|Forest law was designed to protect the habitat of the deer and other hunted animals. It was unrelated to the customs and common law of England and its punishments were quite severe compared to the normal punishments of the common law.<ref name=Forest>Saul "Forest" ''Companion to Medieval England'' pp. 105<U+2013>107</ref>}} <U+2013> and presided over the [[Justice in Eyre|forest justices]], who held [[forest eyre]]s. There was also a special forest [[exchequer]], or forest treasury.<ref name=Turner61>Turner ''King John'' p. 61</ref> In 1198 de Neville presided over an [[Assize]] of the Forest that was described by the chronicler [[Roger of Howden]] as greatly oppressive.<ref name=Young29>Young ''Royal Forests'' pp. 29<U+2013>30</ref> The revenues could be considerable; in 1198 the forest eyre brought in <U+00A3>1,980.<ref name=Young39>Young ''Royal Forests'' p. 39</ref> De Neville stated in 1298 that over the previous six and a half years the amount raised by the various revenues of the forests had been <U+00A3>15,000;<ref name=Turner84>Turner ''King John'' p. 84</ref> in 1212 it had been <U+00A3>4,486.<ref name=Young39/> Forest law was resented by the king's subjects not just for its severity but also for the large extent of the country that it encompassed. It covered not just woodlands, but by the end of the 12th century it covered between a quarter and a third of the kingdom. This extent allowed the Norman and Angevin kings to use the harsh punishments of forest law to extract large sums of money for the government.<ref name=Forest/>

De Neville continued to hold the office of Chief Forester under King John, and was often the king's gambling partner.<ref name=Warren145/> He was a frequent witness on John's royal [[charter]]s.<ref name=Turner57>Turner ''King John'' pp. 57<U+2013>58</ref> Under John, de Neville was named to the offices of [[High Sheriff of Hampshire|Sheriff of Hampshire]] in 1210,<ref name=DNB/> and [[High Sheriff of Cumberland|Sheriff of Cumberland]], offices of which he was deprived in 1212.<ref name=Neville29>Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' p. 29</ref> He was also reappointed to the sheriffdoms of Essex and Hertfordshire in 1202 until 1203.<ref name=CP479>Cokayne ''Complete Peerage'' '''IX''' pp. 479<U+2013>480</ref>

In 1210 John fined de Neville 1,000 [[mark (money)|marks]] because he had allowed [[Peter des Roches]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]], to enclose some hunting grounds without royal permission; although des Roches was close to the king, that was an infringement of the royal forests. De Neville's large fine was likely a warning that the king was serious about enforcing the forest law, but it was eventually rescinded.<ref name=Warren145>Warren ''King John'' p. 145</ref> In 1213 de Neville was placed in charge of the seaports along the coast from Cornwall to Hampshire,<ref name=CP479/> but some time in 1213 it appears that he fell from favour, although the circumstances are unknown. A fine of 6,000 marks was assessed on him for allowing two prisoners to escape, as well as other unrecorded offences, although the king did subsequently remit 1,000 marks of the fine. In 1215 de Neville lost his office of forester.<ref name=Young50>Young ''Royal Forests'' pp. 50<U+2013>51</ref> De Neville was present at [[Runnymede]] for the signing of ''[[Magna Carta]]'' and was mentioned in the preamble as one of King John's councillors,<ref name=Neville30>Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' p. 30</ref> as well as serving as a witness to the document.<ref name=DNB/> [[Roger of Wendover]], a chronicler writing in 1211, listed de Neville as one of King John's "evil councillors".<ref name=List>Vincent "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/theme/95591 King John's evil counsellors (act. 1208<U+2013>1214)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>

==John's later reign and service under King Henry III==

John's style of ruling and his defeats on the continent in 1214 had alienated many of his nobles.<ref name=Huscroft150>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 150<U+2013>151</ref> Initially, a faction of the barons forced John to agree to ''Magna Carta'' to secure less capricious government from the king.<ref name=Bartlett64>Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 64</ref> John, however, after agreeing to their demands, secured the annulment of the charter from the papacy in late 1215. The opposition magnates then invited Prince Louis to take the English throne, and the French prince arrived in England with an army in May 1216.<ref name=Huscroft150/>

De Neville joined the rebel barons in 1216,<ref name=Warren190>Warren ''King John'' p. 190</ref> shortly after Prince [[Louis VIII of France|Louis of France]] invaded England.<ref name=Carpenter12>Carpenter ''Minority of Henry III'' p. 12</ref> De Neville surrendered [[Marlborough Castle]], a royal castle in his custody, to Prince Louis in mid-1216. Louis had not besieged the castle, and it appears that de Neville took the initiative in making overtures to the prince. When John heard of the change of sides, he confiscated all of de Neville's lands held directly from the king on {{nowrap|8 July}} 1216. On 4 September 1216 the king further confiscated lands belonging to other rebels that had been granted to de Neville before the surrender of Marlborough; some were re-granted to de Neville's brother William. Hugh de Neville's son, Herbert, also joined the rebels.<ref name=Neville31>Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' p. 31</ref>

After King John's death in October 1216, de Neville and his son made their peace with the new king, Henry&nbsp;III, John's son. Both men had their lands restored in 1217, but the offices that the elder de Neville had held were not returned quickly. Custody of some royal forests was returned by 1220, but the office of Chief Forester was not returned until some time later.<ref name=Neville32>Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' p. 32</ref> In 1218 de Neville was supposed to have had the [[Rockingham Forest|forest of Rockingham]] returned to his custody, but [[William II de Forz, 3rd Earl of Albemarle|William de Fors]], the [[Count of Aumale]], refused to return it.<ref name=Carpenter72>Carpenter ''Minority of Henry III'' p. 72</ref> It was not until 1220 that de Neville managed to recover his custody of Rockingham forest.<ref name=Carpenter199>Carpenter ''Minority of Henry III'' p. 199</ref> By 1224 de Neville was once more Chief Forester,<ref name=Young70>Young ''Royal Forests'' p. 70</ref> but he never regained the power and influence that he had held under John.<ref name=Neville24/> When he lost the office the second time is unclear. The historian C. R. Young states that he held the office until his death in 1234 when it passed to his son John,<ref name=Neville32/> but Daniel Crook, writing in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', claims that de Neville lost the forester office in 1229, replaced by John of Monmouth and Brian de Lisle.<ref name=DNB/> He also served as [[High Sheriff of Lincolnshire|Sheriff of Lincolnshire]] during 1227.<ref name=CP479/>

==Records and lands==

De Neville's household records for 1207 still survive, detailing his itinerary for the year; in one eight-week period his household visited 11 different towns.<ref name=Bartlett142>Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 142</ref> His wife pledged in 1204 to pay the king 200 chickens for the right to sleep one night with her husband, an obligation recorded in the royal records.<ref name=Warren190/>{{efn|De Neville's entry in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' states that the fine was instead 200 [[shillings]].<ref name=DNB/> The original Latin of the record states "Uxor Hugonis de Nevill' dat domino Regi CC. gallinas eo quod possit jacere una nocte cum domino suo Hugone de Nevill'".<ref name=CP480fng>Cokayne ''Complete Peerage'' '''IX''' p. 480 footnote g</ref> "CC. Gallinas" in that sentence is "200 hens".<ref name=Word207>Latham ''Revised Medieval Latin Word-List'' p. 207</ref>}} The historian Daniel Crook suggests it shows that Joan was one of the barons' wives who attracted King John's sexual attentions.<ref name=DNB/>

De Neville inherited lands in Lincolnshire worth one half of a [[knight's fee]]. These were augmented with gifts from Richard and John, much of which were in [[Essex]]. He also acquired lands in Surrey and Somerset, and his marriage to Joan brought properties in Essex.<ref name=Neville33>Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' p. 33</ref> Joan's lands also brought de Neville into conflict with [[Falkes de Breaut<U+00E9>]], the husband of Joan's younger sister and co-heiress, and the two brothers-in-law were involved in lawsuits over their wives' lands for more than five years.<ref name=Neville47>Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' p. 47</ref> Joan and her sister were also co-heiresses to the barony of Courcy, in right of their mother Alice de Courcy.<ref name=DNB/>

==Death and legacy==

De Neville's first wife, Joan de Cornhill, died after December 1224. He remarried some time before April 1230 to Beatrice, the widow of Ralph de Fay and one of five daughters of Stephen of Turnham. Joan and de Neville had at least three sons&nbsp;<U+2013> John, Henry,<ref name=DNB/> and Herbert.<ref name=Neville31/> De Neville also had a daughter named Joan.<ref name=DNB/>

De Neville died in 1234,<ref name=Nevillexi>Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' p. xi</ref> although his death was erroneously recorded by [[Matthew Paris]] as occurring in 1222.{{efn|This error led some earlier historians to postulate two different Hugh de Nevilles <U+2013> the forester and a son also named Hugh. This disproved theory then had the elder Hugh dying in 1222 and the invented son dying in 1234.<ref name=DNB/>}} De Neville was buried at [[Waltham Abbey (abbey)|Waltham Abbey]], of which he had been a patron.<ref name=DNB/> Besides Waltham, he also made gifts to [[Christ Church Priory]] in Canterbury, [[Bullington Priory]] in Lincolnshire, and [[St James Church, Clerkenwell#Nunnery of St Mary: c. 1100 - 1539|St Mary's, Clerkenwell]].<ref name=CP480>Cokayne ''Complete Peerage'' '''IX''' p. 480 footnote j</ref> The historian [[Sidney Painter]] said of de Neville's career during John's reign that "a strong argument could be advanced for the thesis that the royal official who wielded the most actual power during John's reign was the chief forester, Hugh de Neville".<ref name=QNeville24>Quoted in Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' p. 24</ref> Another historian, J. R. Maddicott, states that de Neville was head of "one of the most detested branches of royal administration".<ref name=Maddicott316>Maddicott "Oath of Marlborough" ''English Historical Review'' p. 316</ref>
