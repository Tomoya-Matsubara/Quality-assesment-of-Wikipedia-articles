'''''The Firebrand''''' is a 1987 [[fantasy]] novel by American author [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]. Set in the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city of [[Troy]], the novel is a re-telling of [[Homer]]'s epic poem, the ''[[Iliad]]''. ''The Firebrand'' is set from the point-of-view of [[Cassandra|Kassandra]], the [[prophet]] daughter of king [[Priam]] of Troy, and also features other prominent characters from [[Greek mythology]], giving readers a new perspective of each. As in the ''Iliad'', Kassandra foresees catastrophe for her city but few pay heed to her warnings. In Bradley's story however, she is also presented as a strong and insightful woman, rather than a sufferer of insanity.

The novel has been described as belonging to the genres of [[Historical revisionism|revisionist history]] and [[feminist literature]], and employs themes of gender, religion, and power. Bradley wrote it after the success of her 1983 novel ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'', a re-telling of the [[Arthurian legend]] from another female perspective. ''The Firebrand'' includes fewer elements of fantasy than her previous works to appeal to a wider readership. Bradley's only novel set in ancient Greece, her husband [[Walter H. Breen]] helped her research the story.

[[Simon & Schuster]] released ''The Firebrand'' on October 1, 1987 in hardcover, and it was issued in paperback in September 1988. ''The Firebrand'' has been overshadowed by the popularity of ''Mists'', receiving less attention and critical praise. Reviews of the book have ranged from mixed to positive, with many literary critics praising Bradley's ability to give new characterizations to legendary figures. It has been translated into at least twelve languages, beginning with Portuguese and French in 1989.

==Synopsis==

====Volume One====
In the wealthy and powerful city of [[Troy]], the pregnant queen [[Hecuba]] experiences a prophetic dream which distresses her. When consulted, a [[priest]]ess of the [[Earth Mother|Great Goddess]] tells Hecuba and her husband, king [[Priam]], that the dream indicates she will birth a son who will bring destruction to Troy. Priam declares that this boy must be exposed to death, but upon his birth three days later, Priam agrees to Hecuba's pleas and has him fostered by a shepherd on the slopes of [[Mount Ida]]. Priam names the boy [[Paris (mythology)|Alexandros]] (later called Paris), and his twin sister, Alexandra, whom Hecuba keeps and decides to call [[Cassandra|Kassandra]].

While visiting the temple of Apollo with her mother, six-year-old Kassandra experiences a vision of the god telling her she is to become "His priestess". Further visions follow during the years, including one at the age of twelve that shows her Paris, who is now a shepherd. Kassandra asks her father of the boy's identity but he reacts angrily. Kassandra is sent to be fostered by Hecuba's sister [[Penthesilea]], chief of the [[Amazons]], a nomadic warrior tribe of only women. There, Kassandra comes to love their lifestyle, though it is not without its trials, and learns of her twin, continuing her visions of him. Kassandra sees the [[Judgement of Paris]], in which her brother deems [[Aphrodite]] more beautiful than [[Athena]] or [[Hera]] <U+2013> Aphrodite rewards him by eventually promising the love of [[Helen of Troy|Helen of Sparta]], daughter of [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] and [[Zeus]]. 

In [[Colchis]], ruled over by queen Imandra, Kassandra undergoes the [[religious rite|rites]] of a priestess and is told that serving the Goddess is her destiny. At the age of fifteen, Kassandra is unhappily returned to her home. She arrives during a festival in time to see Paris win and be revealed to his true parents as their son. Despite the prophecy, Priam and Hecuba happily welcome him home. However, [[Hector]] and his other brothers, jealous of the attention and achievements Paris has suddenly garnered, suggest that he be sent abroad to treaty with king [[Agamemnon]], who holds Priam's sister. Paris readily agrees.

Meanwhile, Kassandra begins training as a priestess of the temple of Apollo, despite misgivings that she is abandoning the Goddess. Part of her duties include helping care for the temple [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]]s, symbols of [[Python (mythology)|Python]] who Apollo is said to have slain. Paris returns to Troy with the beautiful Helen, wife of king [[Menelaus]], and she is welcomed into the city. Kassandra's warnings that Helen will destroy Troy go unheeded, and Paris denounces his sister as a madwoman.

====Volume Two====
Later at the temple, Kassandra is assaulted by [[Chryses|Khryse]], a priest who disguises himself as Apollo in order to seduce her. She sees through his trick and fights him off, but the God feels insulted enough by her refusal to make her prophecies not believed in the city. Menelaus' brother Agamemnon uses Helen's flight as a pretext for war and soon begins launching daily raids on Troy, beginning the [[Trojan War]]. Kassandra spends more time with her family to help with daily tasks while the men, led by Hector, fight off the Akhaian invaders. The war continues in fits and bursts, despite the attempts of former Trojan ally [[Odysseus]] to end the conflict. 

Two years into the war, Kassandra returns to Colchis to learn more of serpent lore, along the way encountering Penthesilea. Kassandra is unhappy to find that the Amazon and [[Centaur|Kentaur]] nomadic ways of life are ending, with Penthesilea's tribe dwindling in number. Kassandra experiences a horrifying vision of Apollo firing arrows indiscriminately at both armies, a sign of his wrath, which prompts her to journey back home. Accompanied with an adopted infant daughter named Honey she found alongside the road, Kassandra returns to Troy and finds that the war is not going well for the city. 

Soon after her return, Apollo takes the form of Khryse and spreads a plague in the Akhaians' camp in response to Agamemnon's sacrilegious refusal to return Khryse's daughter; the girl, who has been Agamemnon's prisoner for three years, is reluctantly returned to her father, and the Akhaian leader takes the concubine of the young warrior [[Achilles|Akhilles]] as reparation for his loss. The furious Akhilles refuses to continue fighting. Menelaus and Paris duel each other, but Paris is able to flee the fight due to the intervention of Helen and Aphrodite.

====Volume Three====
Meanwhile, most of her family has come to think of Kassandra as mad, and become angry when she feels compelled to vocalize prophecies that foretell the end of Troy. Despite Kassandra's warnings, the city experiences an earthquake sent by [[Poseidon]], killing the three young sons of Helen and Paris. After [[Patroclus|Patroklus]] is killed by Hector, his closest friend Akhilles again joins the fight to get his revenge <U+2013> Hector and his younger brother [[Troilus]] are killed, to the grief of everyone in Troy. Akhilles later also kills Penthesilea in battle, and soon after Kassandra fires a fatal poisoned arrow at his unprotected heel.

Poseidon sends an earthquake, knocking down Troy's defenses. The Akhaians flood into the city, and Kassandra and Honey are raped by the warrior [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]]. The women of Troy are divided up among the Akhaians, and Kassandra becomes the concubine of Agamemnon. She is freed at last when his wife [[Klytemnestra]] murders him upon their return to [[Mycenae|Mykenae]]. Kassandra makes her way back to [[Asia Minor]], where in the desert, she hopes to recreate a kingdom of old<U+2014>one ruled by a powerful queen.

==Development==
''The Firebrand'' was written by American author and editor [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]] (1930<U+2013>1999), best known for her [[Darkover series|''Darkover'' science fiction series]] and popular 1983 novel, ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'', a re-telling of the [[Arthurian legend]] from the point of view of Arthur's antagonist, [[Morgan le Fay]].<ref>Paxson, pp. 11, 18.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.us.penguingroup.com/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,1000004680,00.html |title=Marion Zimmer Bradley |publisher=[[Penguin Group]] |accessdate=January 2, 2012}}</ref> Though Bradley refused to label herself as a [[feminist]],<ref>Paxson, p. 113.</ref> her works often dealt with themes of gender, religion, and power, particularly in historically patriarchal societies.<ref>Paxson, pp. 113<U+2013>14.</ref><ref>Fry, pp. 71<U+2013>72, 78.</ref> A self-described Christian,<ref name=Fry76/> Bradley was also known for incorporating [[neopagan]] beliefs and viewpoints into her body of work; Carrol Fry of [[Northwest Missouri State University]] notes that although Bradley "seemed rather contemptuous of many New Age concepts that most New-Pagans hold dear," she "clearly identifies with the values of feminist Pagans" through her writings.<ref>Fry, p. 77.</ref>

These views influenced Bradley's writing of ''The Firebrand'', which she penned after publishing ''The Mists of Avalon'' in 1983.<ref>Paxson, p. 117.</ref> ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'' observed that after ''Mists'', Bradley designed stories with a stronger literary appeal in an effort to appeal to a wider readership; rather than focus on the "straightforward" fantasy genre, Bradley's later works often centered around strong lead characters in "mytho-historic settings," with fewer elements of fantasy.<ref name=CluteGrant135>Clute & Grant, p. 135.</ref> For example, in ''The Firebrand'' the Kentaurs are depicted as a nomadic tribe of short, naked riders of horses rather than as the half-human, half-horsemen legends traditionally portray.<ref>Dorschel , p. 179.</ref> 

''The Firebrand'' was Bradley's second re-telling of a famous legend,<ref>Crosby, p. 54.</ref> and her only novel set in ancient Greece.<ref>Dorschel , p. 151.</ref> In deciding to re-envision legends from a female perspective, the author stated that she had an interest to "hear more about the human realities" surrounding well-known stories, but did not believe this constituted a feminist writing style.<ref>Sharp, p. 243.</ref> In an interview with Lisa See of ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', Bradley said she viewed the Trojan War legend as an example of masculine culture dominating and obfuscating female viewpoints and contributions. She explained: {{Quote|"During the Dorian invasion, when iron won out over bronze, the female cult died. The Minoan and Mycenaean cultures were dead overnight. But you could also look at that period of history and say, here were two cultures that should have been ruled by female twins<U+2014>Helen and Klytemnestra. And what do you know? When they married Menelaus and Agamemnon, the men took over their cities. I just want to look at what history was really like before the women-haters got hold of it. I want to look at these people like any other people, as though no one had ever written about them before."<ref name=concise/>}}

Unlike ''Mists'', which featured a wide range of Arthurian legends that Bradley drew upon as source material, the author cited few sources while writing ''The Firebrand''.<ref name=Smith/> Bradley credits her then-husband, author [[Walter H. Breen]], with helping her research the book and create the story. Breen was knowledgeable about [[ancient Greek]] history and its language; according to Bradley, he persuaded her to use linguisticly more correct [[transliteration]]s of the characters' names, such as Akhilles rather than the more known form of Achilles.<ref name=acknowledgements>Bradley, ''Acknowledgments''.</ref> Though Kassandra's fate remains unknown in the ''[[Iliad]]'', Bradley found inspiration for the character's ending from an inscription at the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|Archaeological Museum in Athens]], which mentioned her descendents.<ref name="Dorschel 155"/><ref name=postscript>Bradley, ''Postscript''.</ref> Bradley also believed that this inscription provided the historical basis for Kassandra's existence.<ref name=acknowledgements/><ref name=BR>Bowen Raddeker, n.p.</ref>

==Themes and analysis==

===Gender roles===
[[File:Aias Kassandra Louvre G458.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Ajax raping Cassandra on an Attic red-figure pottery cup, c. 440-430 BC: Classical depictions of Cassandra show her with characteristics associated with insanity, such as nudity and wild hair.]]

In the original story found in the ''Iliad'', female characters receive little attention; though they are often crucial to progressing events, they have no developed identities of their own, instead being defined by motherhood, wifehood, and sisterhood.<ref>Dorschel, pp. 152, 156<U+2013>57.</ref> Cassandra is described in that story as "the loveliest of [Priam's] lovely daughters," but does not speak at all.<ref name=Dorschel152/><ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'', xiii, 363<U+2013>367.</ref> Today she is remembered for both portending the city's doom and for not being believed by its inhabitants, who think she is mad; on [[Pottery of ancient Greece|ancient Greek pottery]] she is depicted as half naked with long, wild hair,<ref name=Dorschel152/> and [[Shakespeare]]'s 1602 play ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' characterizes her as an insane woman.<ref>[[Shakespeare]], ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', Act 2, Scene 2, 96<U+2013>125.</ref> After the Akhaians use the Trojan Horse to gain entry into Troy, the ''[[Aeneid]]'' and other accounts relay how Cassandra is raped by Ajax<ref>[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' ii. 403</ref> and then taken captive by Agamemnon, later killed alongside him by his angry wife Clytemnestra.<ref name=Thompson192/><ref>[[Aeschylus]], ''[[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]]'', 1370<U+2013>75.</ref><ref name=Dorschel152-54>Dorschel, pp. 152<U+2013>54.</ref> By setting her story from the female perspective, Bradley gives women, especially the formerly silenced Cassandra, a voice by re-telling the legend from their eyes.<ref>Dorschel, pp. 155<U+2013>56, 166.</ref><ref>Crosby, pp. 54<U+2013>55.</ref> Here, Kassandra is no lunatic, but rather a strong and insightful woman, yet still misunderstood by many of those around her.<ref>Dorschel, pp. 170<U+2013>71.</ref> She is allowed to survive in order to record a female counter-narrative.<ref>Komar, p. 174.</ref> 

''The Firebrand'' has been seen to employ similar themes to Bradley's other works,<ref name=concise/><ref>Woods Roberts, p. 113.</ref> including the swapping of gender roles, where "women are the true heroes," while the "proud, arrogant" men who lead Troy to doom "fail to invoke the reader's sympathy."<ref name=magill/> Indeed, the title of the novel refers to the male character Paris and the destruction he brings to Troy.<ref name=NYT/><ref>Bradley, p. 483.</ref> ''The Firebrand'' has been perceived as belonging in the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist history]] genre,<ref>Crosby, p. 17.</ref> as it fits into a "reinvent[ion of] stories that are either historical or derived from myth/legend but often taken to be historical," and then told with a different narrative.<ref name=BR/> Despite Bradley's views, the novel has also been seen as an example of [[feminist literature]].<ref>Crosby, p. 43.</ref> Bradley introduces feminist ideals by equating the patriarchal culture with oppressive tendencies;<ref name=Dorschel166/> perceived to have been scorned by the male god Apollo, Kassandra is not believed by Trojan citizens because of her gender.<ref>Dorschel, p. 172.</ref> 

Dorschel writes that because there is "no humanity or compassion in this masculine world," characters traditionally associated with noble, positive qualities are instead "stripped of their own glamor" and portrayed in a negative light <U+2013> Akhilles for instance is a "mad dog" who rapes Penthesilea as an act of "cold-blooded" contempt, rather than as an act of sudden love upon causing her death.<ref>Dorschel, pp. 175<U+2013>76.</ref> Agamemnon and Menelaus are rendered as patriarchal stereotypes.<ref name="Dorschel 177"/> In her entry for ''Science Fiction & Fantasy Book Review Annual'', Mary-Kay Bray proposes that Bradley's account makes these traditional heroes seem more human and flawed, even if they are also less admirable.<ref name=Bray106>Bray, p. 106.</ref>

===Religion and gender===
Bradley believed that "cultural shock, the clash of alien cultures, is the essence of literature and drama," and incorporated this viewpoint into many of her works.<ref>Sharp, p. 244.</ref> ''The Firebrand'' is set in such a time of change, and Kassandra is caught between new and old cultures.<ref name=Thompson193/><ref name=Bray106/> Despite being ruled by a king and worshiping the male god Apollo, the Trojans still respect the ancient cult surrounding the Earth Mother; in Colchis, the powerful queen Imandra rules alone but her way of life is represented as declining <U+2013> she is aging and uncertain of her successor, and the impoverished areas surrounding Colchis contain two other dwindling civilizations: the Amazons and the Kentaurs.<ref name=Thompson193/>

Literary critics have observed elements of neopaganism in the novel. Bradley often included characteristics of neopaganism into her stories as she explored the intersection of gender and religion.<ref name="Fry68"/> While neopaganism lacks a singular definition, many followers have come to define it as a primitive, matriarchal religion that "flourished" in Western Europe, centered around the worship of a "Mother Goddess", and became largely decimated by [[Christianity]].<ref name="Fry68">Fry, p. 68.</ref> Fry writes that "a basic assumption [in ''The Firebrand''] is that the people of ancient Greece had worshiped the Goddess prior to the arrival of the Akhaians," a people who brought with them a "male warrior pantheon of Gods&nbsp;... and gradually subverted the old ways."<ref name=Fry75/> As Bradley's Penthesilea tells a young Kassandra, "But remember, child: before ever Apollo Sun Lord came to rule these lands, our Horse Mother <U+2013> the Great Mare, the Earth Mother from whom we all are born <U+2013> she was here."<ref>Bradley, p. 58.</ref>

[[File:Amazons tishbein.jpg|left|thumb|300px|''Amazons'' by [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein|Tischbein]], c. 1820: through Kassandra, Bradley shows her idealization of the [[Amazons]], especially in the wake of a rising patriarchal culture.]]

In a similar vein with ''Mists'', ''The Firebrand'' "intertwines two belief systems" and combines neopaganism with elements of [[Greek mythology]].<ref name=Fry76>Fry, p. 76.</ref> Robin Anne Reid, author of ''Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy'', also found similarities between the two novels, as they serve "parallel purposes" by retelling an old legend from the female perspective. Both stories deal with the confrontation between female-based, Earth-centered belief systems and rising patriarchal religions.<ref name=Reid247>Reid, p. 247.</ref> This religious dichotomy appears firstly as a conflict between Apollo and the Goddess, and later in the novel as a confrontation between the Akhaian and Trojan gods.<ref name=Smith/><ref>Dorschel, pp. 166<U+2013>68, 178<U+2013>79.</ref><ref>Crosby, p. 56.</ref> By the tradition told in the novel, serpents represent the Mother Goddess' prominent place in religious life, as well as immortality, rebirth, and regeneration. Readers are told that Python, a female snake deity and symbol of the Goddess, was slain by the Hellenistic Apollo, thus representing the destruction of feminine social, political, and religious power.<ref name=Reid247/><ref>Dorschel, pp. 178<U+2013>79.</ref> 

Bradley uses the story's various female characters to also create a feminist dichotomy; Kassandra and Penthesilea represent the "feminist side" in their pursuit of independence, while many of the other women, such as Andromache, Hecuba, and Helen, "subordinate themselves to patriarchal traditions, values, goods."<ref name=Smith>Smith, n.p.</ref><ref>Dorschel, pp. 166<U+2013>68.</ref> The loss of this matriarchal culture has been viewed as the novel's main theme.<ref name=Dorschel166>Dorschel, p. 166.</ref> Bradley writes of the power of women in many of her works, including ''Mists'' and the ''Darkover'' series,<ref>Fry, pp. 70<U+2013>71.</ref> and ''The Firebrand'' continues this by depicting Kassandra in an idealized world <U+2013> the Amazons follow the Earth Goddess but are slowly dwindling in the wake of the patriarchal "male warrior pantheon of Gods."<ref name=Fry75>Fry, p. 75.</ref> Through Kassandra's experiences with the Amazons, Bradley shows that she clearly idealizes this group of women.<ref name=Fry75/>

Besides, the ''Iliad'' stops short just at the most interesting point, leaving the writer to conjecture about the end from assorted legends and traditions."<ref name=acknowledgements/> ''[[The Library Journal]]'' recommended readers familiarize themselves with Greek mythology before beginning the book, and noted the author "makes a strong statement about the desirability of women having control of their own destinies and about the cruelties men inflict upon them."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.libus.csd.mu.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=2ff78d99-77df-455e-972a-194514e57cdd%40sessionmgr111&vid=1&hid=123 |title=The Firebrand (Book) |work=[[The Library Journal]] |first=Andrea Lee |last=Shuey |date=October 15, 1987 |accessdate=January 2, 2013}} {{Subscription needed}}</ref> ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'' opined that ''The Firebrand'' and her 1994 novel ''[[The Forest House]]'' "display [Bradley's] talent for plot, character, vision and fine storytelling."<ref name=CluteGrant135/>

Reviewing for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', H.J. Kirchhoff compared the novel to ''Mists'', finding that the former "is neither as refreshing nor as lovely, even though it is a pretty good read."<ref name=Kirchhoff>{{cite web|url =http://0-search.proquest.com.libus.csd.mu.edu/docview/386021768/fulltext/13BA70FAE284E890AEE/7?accountid=100 |title=BOOK BRIEFS An old story THE FIREBRAND |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |first=H.J. |last=Kirchhoff |date=December 26, 1987 |accessdate=January 16, 2013 }} {{Subscription needed }}</ref> Kirchhoff thought that ''The Firebrand'' contained too many similarities to Bradley's previous novels, as "the interlarding of old story and feminist ideology seems forced," though he "ironically" found praise in her "flesh-and-blood" depiction of the men associated with the legend.<ref name=Kirchhoff/> Vicki McCash of the ''[[Sun Sentinel]]'' commended the novel for making the legendary characters "breathe and feel" and for giving a "refreshing" twist to the ancient story. The reviewer continued, "From the first pages, the reader is gripped in the magic of ancient Troy. These stories have been revered for centuries, but in ''The Firebrand'' they are retold to become one epic novel, not only of heroes and gods, but of heroines and goddesses and of change in the very fabric of society."<ref name=mccash/> McCash did however speculate that male readers might be troubled by the negative portrayals of their sex, but that Bradley attempted to avoid this by inputting a few "sympathetic" men such as Aeneas and several "evil" women such as Klytemnestra.<ref name=mccash>{{Cite news | last = McCash | first = Vicki | title = A Feminist Reworking of Mythology | work= [[Sun Sentinel]]  | date =April 17, 1988  | page=10F }}</ref> Virginia Judge of ''[[The Herald (Rock Hill)|The Herald]]'' called it a "fascinating, but lengthy tale," and especially praised depictions of the old religion.<ref name=judge/> She did however criticize the ending for seeming "contrived."<ref name=judge>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RS0tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Db0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=1772,2253087&dq=firebrand+marion+zimmer+bradley&hl=en |title='Firebrand' tells woman's views of the legend of Trojan War |work=[[The Herald (Rock Hill)|The Herald]] |first=Virginia |last=Judge |date=January 16, 1988 |accessdate=December 20, 2012}}</ref> 

A reviewer for the ''[[English Journal]]'' praised the novel, as it found one of its main strengths to be "its ability to entertain the reader with characters who are basically faithful to their origins in the ''Iliad'', yet at the same time rounder, fuller, and more personally engaging."<ref name=Frederick85/> Bradley, the ''Journal'' noted, "fleshes out the stereotypes on which the characterization in the epic poem rests <U+2013> the cold calculating Achilles; crafty, gregarious Odysseus; frustrated Cassandra <U+2013> with convincing dialogue which not only carries the plot but gives reference to other events both mythical and historical."<ref name=Frederick85>Frederick, p. 85.</ref> In an overview of Bradley's body of work, ''Encyclopedia of Fantasy and Horror Fiction'' author Don D'Amassa called the novel "one of her better fantasies."<ref>D'Ammassa, p. 34.</ref> Bradley's works have earned praise from feminist critics, who have particularly lauded her ability to portray multidimensional women as "revered conduit[s] of nature-based religion and mysticism" as seen with the character of Kassandra.<ref name=Snodgrass79>Snodgrass, p. 79.</ref> The ''English Journal'' contended that "Bradley tempers the bitterness and cynicism of Homer's Cassandra, presenting instead a woman confused and tormented by knowledge on which she is powerless to act."<ref name=Frederick85/> At the 1988 [[Locus Award]]s, ''The Firebrand'' was voted the twentieth best fantasy novel of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/Locus1988.html |title=1988 Locus Awards |work=[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]] |accessdate=March 17, 2013}}</ref>
