'''''Banksia lemanniana''''', commonly known as the '''yellow lantern banksia''' or '''Lemann's banksia''', is a species of woody shrub of the family [[Proteaceae]] native to [[Western Australia]]. It generally grows as an open shrub or small tree to five metres (15&nbsp;ft) high with stiff serrated leaves, and unusual hanging [[inflorescence]]s. Flowering occurs over summer, the greenish buds developing into oval flower spikes before turning grey and developing the characteristic large woody [[follicle (fruit)|follicle]]s. It occurs within and just east of the [[Fitzgerald River National Park]] on the southern coast of the state. ''Banksia lemanniana'' is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed.

First described by Swiss botanist [[Carl Meissner]] in 1856, it was named in honour of English botanist [[Charles Morgan Lemann]]. It is one of three or four related species all with [[pendent]] inflorescences, which is an unusual feature within the genus. No subspecies are recognised. ''Banksia lemanniana'' is classified as Not Threatened under the [[Wildlife Conservation Act 1950|Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia]]. Unlike many Western Australian banksias, it appears to have some resistance to dieback from the soil-borne [[water mould]] ''[[Phytophthora cinnamomi]]'', and is one of the easier Western Australian species to grow in cultivation.

''Banksia lemanniana'' grows as an open shrub or, less commonly, a small tree to 5&nbsp;m (15&nbsp;ft) in height, with a spreading [[Habit (biology)|habit]]. The trunk has thin grey bark and can reach a diameter of 15&nbsp;cm (6&nbsp;in).<ref name="George 1981">{{cite journal | last = George | first=Alex S. | authorlink=Alex George | year = 1981 | title = [[The genus Banksia L.f.

The stiff leaves are narrowly [[Leaf shape|wedge-shaped]] or more oval (cuneate to obovate) and measure 3 to 9&nbsp;cm (1.2<U+2013>3.6&nbsp;in) in length by 1.2<U+2013>3.5&nbsp;cm (0.5<U+2013>1.5&nbsp;in) wide. The leaf margins are serrated, with many teeth measuring 0.1 to 0.3&nbsp;cm each.<ref name="George 1999"/>

Flowering typically occurs between October and January. Unlike those of most other banksias, the cylindrical [[inflorescence]]s hang down from branchlets and measure 5<U+2013>11&nbsp;cm (2<U+2013>4.4&nbsp;in) in length and {{convert|8|<U+2013>|10|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} in diameter. They are green-yellow in colour and smell of honey, and drip large amounts of nectar. The buds are a rich chocolate brown in colour until the yellow flowers push through. The inflorescences turn grey as they age, and the old flowers remain as up to 20 large woody [[Follicle (fruit)|follicles]] develop. Oval in shape, wrinkled in texture and covered with fine hair, they can reach 4.5&nbsp;cm (1.8&nbsp;in) long, 3&nbsp;cm (1.2&nbsp;in) high, and 3&nbsp;cm (1.2&nbsp;in) wide.<ref name="George 1999">{{cite book|last=George|first=Alex|authorlink=Alex George|year=1999|chapter=Banksia|editor-last=Wilson|editor-first=Annette|title=Flora of Australia: Volume 17B: Proteaceae 3: Hakea to Dryandra|pages=175<U+2013>251|publisher=CSIRO Publishing / Australian Biological Resources Study|location=Collingwood, Victoria|isbn=0-643-06454-0}}</ref>

The obovate seed is {{convert|4|<U+2013>|4.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and fairly flattened, and is composed of the wedge-shaped seed body proper, measuring  {{convert|1.2|<U+2013>|1.5|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} long and {{convert|1|<U+2013>|1.3|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} wide, and a papery [[Glossary of botanical terms#W|wing]]. One side, termed the outer surface, is dark brown and wrinkled, while the other is black and smooth. Both surfaces sparkle slightly. The seeds are separated by a sturdy dark brown [[seed separator]] that is roughly the same shape as the seeds with a depression where the seed body sits adjacent to it in the follicle. Seedlings have cuneate (wedge-shaped) [[cotyledon]]s which measure {{convert|1.2|<U+2013>|1.5|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} long and {{convert|1.5|<U+2013>|1.8|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}  wide. These are dull green, sometimes with a reddish tinge, and the margin of the wedge may be [[Glossary of plant morphology#crenulate|crenulated]] (lined with small teeth).

==Taxonomy==
{{main|Taxonomy of Banksia}}
The first known botanical collection of ''B.&nbsp;lemanniana'' was made by [[James Drummond (botanist)|James Drummond]] in early 1847, during a voyage of botanical exploration through the [[Stirling Ranges]] to [[Cape Riche]], in company with [[George Maxwell]]. This expedition would result in much of Drummond's renowned "Fourth Collection", including the celebrated ''[[Hakea victoria]]''.<ref name="Erickson 1969">{{cite book|author=Erickson, Rica|year=1969|title=The Drummonds of Hawthornden|location=Osborne Park, Western Australia|publisher=Lamb Paterson|authorlink=Rica Erickson|pages=112<U+2013>18}}</ref> On returning home, Drummond sent a report of his explorations to ''[[The Inquirer (Perth)|The Inquirer]]'', which published it on 14 April. In it, Drummond states "On Mount Barren I found... a remarkable nodding yellow-flowered Banksia, with leaves and a habit so like B. Caleyii, that it can only be distinguished by the cones and flowers, which are widely different." This is now recognised as a reference to ''B.&nbsp;lemanniana''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Barker|first=Robyn|year=1996|title=James Drummond<U+2019>s  newspaper accounts of  his collecting activities,  in particular his 4th  Collection and ''Hakea victoria''  (Proteaceae)|journal=Nuytsia|volume=11|issue=1|pages=1<U+2013>9 [8]|url=http://florabase.dpaw.wa.gov.au/science/nuytsia/247.pdf}}</ref>

The name ''Banksia lemanniana'' first appeared in print in 1852, being included in "A List of the Proteaceae Collected in South-Western Australia by Mr James Drummond", written by [[Carl Meissner]] and published in ''[[Hooker's Journal of Botany and Kew Garden Miscellany]]''.<ref name="Meissner 1852">{{cite journal | first = Carl | last = Meissner | authorlink = Carl Meissner | year = 1852 | title = A list of the Proteaceae collected in south-western Australia by Mr. James Drummond | journal = Hooker's Journal of Botany and Kew Garden Miscellany | volume = 4 | page = 211}}</ref> Four years later, Meissner published a formal [[species description]] in his chapter on the [[Proteaceae]] for [[A.

Meissner placed ''B.&nbsp; lemanniana'' in [[Series (botany)|series]] ''[[Banksia ser.

In [[Bentham's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia|Bentham's arrangement]], the number of recognised ''Banksia'' species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham defined four [[Section (botany)|sections]] based on leaf, [[style (botany)|style]] and [[pollen-presenter]] characters.

In his 1981 monograph ''[[The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)]]'', [[Alex George]] placed ''B.&nbsp; lemanniana'' in [[Banksia subg. Banksia|''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Banksia'']] because its inflorescence is a typical ''Banksia'' flower spike; in [[Banksia sect. Banksia|''B.''&nbsp;sect. ''Banksia'']] because of its straight [[Gynoecium|style]]s. He made it the [[type species]] of [[Banksia ser. Tetragonae|''B.''&nbsp;ser. ''Tetragonae'']], the members of which are defined by their pendulous inflorescences and tetragonal limbs. He considered it closely related to ''[[Banksia aculeata|B.&nbsp;aculeata]]'' and ''[[Banksia caleyi|B.&nbsp;caleyi]]'', which are smaller, more compact, shrubs with red- or pink-tinged inflorescences.<ref name="George 1981"/>

In 1996, [[Kevin Thiele]] and Pauline Ladiges published the results of a [[cladistics|cladistic]] analysis of [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characters of ''Banksia''. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. George's ''B.''&nbsp;ser. ''Tetragonae'' was found to be [[monophyletic]], and therefore retained; and their analysis of the relationships within the series supported the placement of  ''B.&nbsp;lemanniana'' as [[Sister group|sister]] to the pair of species ''B.&nbsp;aculeata'' and ''B.&nbsp;caleyi''.<ref name="Thiele 1996">{{cite journal | last1 = Thiele | first1 = Kevin | authorlink1 = Kevin Thiele | last2 = Ladiges | first2 = Pauline Y. | year = 1996 | title = A cladistic analysis of ''Banksia'' (Proteaceae) | journal = [[Australian Systematic Botany]] | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 661<U+2013>733 | doi = 10.1071/SB9960661}}</ref>

Since 1998, [[Austin Mast]] has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of [[DNA sequence]] data for the subtribe [[Banksiinae]].

Early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring ''Dryandra'' to ''Banksia'', and publishing ''B.''&nbsp;subg.

They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of ''Dryandra'' was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then ''B.&nbsp; lemanniana'' is placed in ''B.''&nbsp;subg.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Banksialemannianarangemap.png|thumb|right|Distribution in southern Western Australia]]
''Banksia lemanniana'' is found near the southern coast of Western Australia, most of its population protected within Fitzgerald River National Park. Outside the park, it reaches the Ravensthorpe Range to the northeast and the [[rabbit-proof fence]] to the east, as well as isolated populations westwards as far as [[Beaufort Inlet|Pallinup estuary]].<ref name = Atlas/> The annual rainfall is {{convert|500|<U+2013>|600|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.<ref name="Collins"/> It is found on the tops and slopes of hills as well as flatter areas on rocky or [[laterite|lateritic]] soil, as well as sand, in [[Mallee Woodlands and Shrublands|mallee scrubland]] or [[Heath (habitat)|heath]]. ''Banksia lemanniana'' is relatively secure as much of its range lies within a National Park, and it is not a species collected for the cut flower industry.<ref name = Atlas/> It is hence classified as Not Threatened under the [[Wildlife Conservation Act 1950|Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia]].<ref>{{FloraBase | name = ''Banksia lemanniana'' Meisn. | id = 1827}}</ref>

==Ecology==
{{see also|Ecology of Banksia}}
A variety of [[pollinator]]s have been recorded visiting the flower spikes, including [[New Holland honeyeater]] (''Phylidonyris novaehollandiae''), [[red wattlebird]] (''Anthochaera carunculata''), native and European honey bees, wasps and ants.<ref name = Atlas/> The flower spikes drip nectar onto the ground or lower leaves, suggesting pollination by nonflying mammals, which are attracted to the scent. Being upside down may facilitate this process.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2398921|last1=Weins | first1=Delbert | last2=Renfree | first2=Marilyn | last3=Wooller | first3=Ronald D.|year=1979|title=Pollen loads of Honey possums (''Tarsipes spencerae'') and non-flying mammal pollination in South-western Australia|journal=Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden|volume=66|issue=4|pages=830<U+2013>38 [835]|url=http://www.botanicus.org/item/31753003566442 |jstor=2398921}}</ref>

''Banksia lemanniana'' is killed by [[bushfire]] and regenerates from seed. It is unclear how quickly seedlings take to reach flowering in the wild, but cultivated records suggest around five or six years.<ref name = Atlas/>  If fire occurs too frequently, plants are burned before reaching maturity or before they have produced sufficient seed to ensure regeneration of the population. This may cause a population decline or even local extinction. Too long a time between fires also causes population decline, as more plants die of natural attrition without releasing their seed, resulting in seed wastage.<ref name="Lamont 1996">{{cite book | last = Lamont | first = Byron B. | authorlink = Byron Lamont | year = 1996 | chapter = Conservation biology of banksias in southwestern Australia | editor1-last = Hopper | editor1-first=Stephen D. | editor2-last=Harvey | editor2-first=M. | editor3-last=Chappill | editor3-first=J. | editor4-last=George | editor4-first=A.

==Cultivation==
One of the easier Western species to grow, ''Banksia lemanniana'' has some horticultural potential in its attractive chocolate buds, green-yellow hanging flower spikes and large grey spikes with prominent follicles. It generally grows quite quickly, but nevertheless takes five to six years to flower from seed. It prefers a more [[Soil pH|alkaline]] rocky or sandy soil, with a nominal [[pH]] range from 6 to 7.5. It favours a sunny position and good drainage, and has been successfully cultivated in more humid climates on Australia's east coast.<ref name="Collins"/> Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 27 to 43 days to [[germinate]].<ref name="Sweedman 2006">{{cite book | last1 = Sweedman | first1 = Luke | last2 = Merritt | first2 = David | year = 2006 | title = Australian Seeds: a Guide to their Collection, Identification and Biology | publisher = CSIRO Publishing | isbn = 0-643-09298-6 | page = 203}}</ref>
