'''Street newspapers''', or '''street papers''', are [[newspaper]]s or [[magazines]] that are sold by [[homelessness|homeless]] or [[poverty|poor]] individuals and are produced mainly in order to support these populations.  Most such newspapers primarily provide coverage about homelessness and poverty-related issues, and aim to strengthen networks of social benefits for the homeless and other marginalized individuals. Street papers also generally seek to provide employment opportunities, community networking and a voice for those marginalized individuals; in addition to being sold by homeless individuals, many street newspapers are also partially produced and written by them.  Finally, many street newspapers seek to educate non-homeless readers about homelessness, although others focus more on mainstream news.

Street newspapers became common in the 1990s and are now published worldwide, with most street newspapers located in the [[United States]] and [[Western Europe]]. They are supported by governments, charities, and organizations such as the [[International Network of Street Papers]] and the [[North American Street Newspaper Association]]. Since the mid-1990s, there has been ongoing controversy among street newspaper publishers over what sort of material should be covered in street newspapers and to what extent the homeless should participate in writing and production.

==Description==
Most street newspapers have three main purposes:<ref name=Heinz535/>
* To provide income and job skills to the homeless and other marginalized individuals, who act as vendors of and often contributors to the newspapers
* To provide coverage of, and educate the general public about issues pertaining to homelessness and poverty
* To establish or strengthen networks of services and social benefits for the homeless and other marginalized individuals

The defining characteristic of a street newspaper is the fact that it is sold by homeless or marginalized vendors.  While street many street newspapers also aim to provide coverage of social issues and educate the public about homelessness, this goal is often secondary: many people who buy street newspapers do so not to gain information and access the content of the newspaper, but to support, and express solidarity with, the homeless vendor.<ref name=Torck372/>  

The precise details on who reads street newspapers are unclear. A pair of 1993 surveys conducted by [[Chicago]]'s ''[[StreetWise]]'' suggested readers of that paper at the time were mostly [[Higher education|college-educated]], slightly over half were female, and slightly over half were single.<ref name=Green42>Green 1998:42.</ref>

===Operations and business===

Most street newspapers operate by having homeless vendors purchase each paper up front for a small fraction of the price, after which they sell the papers for a set price and retain all the proceeds from street sales.<ref name=NASNA/><ref name=CSM/><ref name=Sthlm/><ref group=note>Some street newspapers, however, work differently, having vendors pay back a portion of the proceeds after selling the paper (Corporal 2009).</ref> The income vendors earn from sales is intended to help them "get back on their feet,"<ref name=NASNA/> and requiring vendors to purchase papers up front and earn back the money by selling them has been said to help develop skills in managing finances.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bigissue.com/How_We_Work_14.php | title=How We Work | publisher=The Big Issue | accessdate=10 February 2009}}</ref> Vendors for most newspapers are identifiable by badges<ref name=KU/><ref>{{cite web | title=About StreetWise Vendors | accessdate=13 January 2009 | url=http://streetwise.org/vendors.html | publisher=[[StreetWise]]}}</ref> or messenger bags.<ref name=KU/> Many newspapers also require that vendors sign a code of conduct<ref>Such as ''The Big Issue'': {{cite web | url=http://www.bigissue.com/How_We_Work_14.php | title=How We Work | publisher=[[The Big Issue]] | accessdate=13 January 2009}}</ref> or otherwise "clean up their act."<ref name=CSM/>

Street papers get started in a variety of ways. Some, such as ''Street Sense'',<ref name=PBS/> were started by homeless or formerly homeless individuals, whereas others are more professional ventures.<ref name=Sthlm/> Many papers receive aid from local government and charities,<ref name=Sthlm/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.larryville.com/index.php/local-news/local-news/16-local-news/91-sweets-on-the-street-change-of-heart-lawrences-homeless-newspaper-is-ten-years-old-this-year | accessdate=12 February 2009 | date=7 December 2006 | last=Roy | first=M.G. | title=Sweets on the Street: Change of Heart, Lawrence's homeless newspaper is ten years old this year | work=The Lawrencian}}</ref> and coalitions such as the International Network of Street Papers and the North American Street Newspaper Association provide workshops and support for new street papers.<ref name=Heinz539/> Many street papers develop in a bottom-up fashion, starting up through volunteer work and "newcomers to the media business" and gradually expanding to include professionals.<ref name=Sthlm/><ref name=Green38>Green 1998:38.</ref> For most papers, the majority of revenue comes from [[donation]]s, government grants, and sometimes [[advertising]].<ref name=Sthlm/><ref name=Heinz538/><ref name=Green41-2/>

Specific business models for street newspapers vary widely, and range from vendor-managed papers that place the highest value upon homeless empowerment and involvement to highly professionalized weeklies that draw upon socially entrepreneurial business principles.<ref name=UNESCO/> Some papers are very successful, such as the UK-based ''The Big Issue'', which as of 2001 sold nearly 300,000 copies a week and earned the equivalent of over 20 million [[United States dollar|USD]], but most papers sell as little as 3,000 copies a month and barely generate a profit at all for the publishers.<ref name=UNESCO/>

===Coverage===
[[File:Bigissue.jpg|right|thumb|''[[The Big Issue]]'' has been a source of controversy over what street newspapers should focus on and how they should conduct business.]]
Most street newspapers report on issues regarding homelessness and poverty,<ref name=UNESCO/> and many papers also feature contributions from the homeless and the poor in addition to articles by [[activist]]s and [[community organizer]]s.<ref name=NASNA/><ref name=Howley63/> For example, the first edition of [[Washington, D.C.]]'s ''[[Street Sense (newspaper)|Street Sense]]'' included a description of a prominent homeless community, an interview with a congresswoman, an editorial about the costs and benefits of taking a job, several poems about homelessness, and a how-to and recipe section;<ref name=CSM/> likewise, a 2009 issue of the [[Lawrence, Kansas]]-based ''Change of Heart'' included a story on the recent bulldozing of a homeless camp, a review of a book on homelessness, a description of the [[Family Promise]] organization for homeless support, and a list of community resources,<ref>Ed. Craig Sweets. ''Change of Heart'': A voice for Lawrence's Homeless People. Vol. 12, no. 1 (Winter 2009).</ref> and content is submitted by the homeless.<ref name=KU>{{cite web | url=http://www.kansan.com/stories/2007/aug/23/newspaper/ | work=[[University Daily Kansan]] | accessdate=13 January 2009 | title=Lawrence Streetpaper receives grant | last=Condron | first=Courtney | date=23 August 2007}}</ref> Many papers also feature profiles of individual street newspaper vendors.<ref name=Heinz538/><ref>Green 1998:43&ndash;4.</ref> The writing style in many street newspapers is simple and clear; social scientist Kevin Howley describes street newspapers as having a "native eloquence."<ref>Howley 2005:64.</ref>

Unlike most street newspapers, the [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based ''The Big Issue'' focuses mostly on celebrity news and interviews, rather than coverage of homelessness and poverty.<ref name=CSM/> It is still sold by homeless vendors and uses the bulk of its proceeds to support homeless individuals and advocacy organizations for the homeless, but the paper's content is mostly written by professional staff and geared towards a broad audience.<ref name=review/> There has been some disagreement between papers over how street newspapers ought to be run; while ''The Big Issue'' is professionally produced and emulates mainstream papers and [[magazine]]s in order to generate a large profit to invest in homeless issues, many other papers believe they should focus on political and social issues rather than on money.<ref name=UNESCO/> Although ''The Big Issue'' has attracted attention and controversy because of its stature, it is not the only street newspaper with this sort of business model.  Numerous other street newspapers work in a similar way, with ''The Big Issue'' just being the most well-known example of a whole category of street newspapers.  Many publishers and advocates of street newspapers see commercialized papers such as ''The Big Issue'' and more [[grassroots]]-style papers as being two models in conflict.<ref name=Sthlm/><ref name=Heinz536>Heinz 2004:536.</ref>

===Social benefits===
In addition to providing some individuals with income and employment, street newspapers are intended to give homeless participants responsibility and independence, and to create a tight-knit homeless community.<ref name=CSM/> Many street papers also offer additional programs to vendors, such as job training, housing placement assistance, and referral to other direct services. Others operate as a program of a larger social services organization&mdash;for instance, Chicago's ''StreetWise'' can refer vendors to providers of "drug and alcohol treatment, high school equivalency classes, career counseling, and permanent housing."<ref name=CSM/> Most street newspapers are also engaged in some form of organizing and advocacy regarding homelessness and poverty, and many function as "watchdogs" for the local homeless communities.<ref name=UNESCO/> Howley has described street newspapers as a means of mobilizing the networks of "formal and informal relationships that exist between the homeless, the unemployed, and the working poor, and shelter managers, healthcare workers, community organizers, and others who work on their behalf."<ref name=Howley63/>

===Challenges and criticisms===
Many street papers face financial difficulties because of insufficient funding.<ref name=Heinz538/><ref name=Green41-2>Green 1998:41&ndash;2.</ref><ref name=review/> In the early days of street newspapers, people were often reluctant to buy from homeless vendors for fear that it was a scam.<ref name=Green36>Green 1998:36.</ref> Furthermore, of the more activist papers, many papers fail to sell well because their writing and production are perceived as unprofessional and lackluster, and the topics covered are sometimes of little relevance or interest to either the general public or the homeless community<ref name=review>{{cite web | url=http://www.rrj.ca/issue/2002/summer/373/ | year=2002 | accessdate=12 February 2009 | last=Brown | first=Ann M. | title=Small Papers, Big Issues | work=[[Ryerson Review of Journalism]]}}</ref> and are perceived as lacking newsworthy content.<ref name=hone>"Homeless Journalists Hone Their Reporting Skills." American News Service, n.d. in Heinz 2004.<br/>"[Street newspapers] have traditionally been long on personal essays and short on hard news."</ref> (In response to these criticisms, organizations in [[Montreal]]<ref name=review/> and [[San Francisco]]<ref name=hone/> have begun to offer workshops in writing and journalism for homeless contributors.) Papers such as ''StreetWise'' have in the past been criticized for being too "grim," and for the vendors' being too loud and intrusive.<ref>Green 1998:40&ndash;1.</ref> Some newspapers sell well but may not be widely read, as many people will donate to vendors without buying, or buy the newspaper and then throw it away.<ref name=Torck372>Torck 2001:372.</ref><ref>Green 1998:36, 40.</ref> On the other hand, those papers that do sell well and are widely read, such as ''The Big Issue'', are often targets of criticism for being too "mainstream" or commercialized.<ref name=review/> 

Other difficulties street newspapers face include "transient" or unreliable staff,<ref name=review/><ref>Green 1998:46.</ref> lack of journalistic freedom for papers that are funded by local government, and, among some demographics, lack of interest in homeless issues.  For example, journalism professor Jim Cunningham has attributed the difficulties in selling [[Calgary]]'s ''Calgary Street Talk'' to the fact that the mostly [[middle-class]], [[conservativism|conservative]] population has "not enough sensitivity to the causes of homelessness."<ref name=review/> Finally, [[anti-homeless legislation]] often targets street newspapers and vendors; for example, in New York City, [[Cleveland]] and other locations, laws have sometimes prevented vendors from selling papers on [[public transit]] or other high-traffic areas, making it difficult for the papers to earn revenue.<ref name=Heinz538/>

==History==
===Historical foundations===
Although the "modern street newspaper" began with the 1989 publication of ''Street News'' in [[New York City]],<ref name=CSM/><ref name=UNESCO/> newspapers sold by the poor and homeless to provide income and bring attention to social problems actually date back to at least the late 19th century: Norma Fay Green has cited ''War Cry'', published by the [[Salvation Army]] in [[London]] from 1879<ref name=Howley62/> to the 1920s,<ref name=NASNA>{{cite web | url=http://www.nasna.org/stpaper.html | publisher=[[North American Street Newspaper Association]] | title=About Street Papers | date=7 November 2008 | accessdate=12 February 2009}}</ref> as an early form of "dissident, underground, alternative publication".<ref name=Howley62>Howley 2005:62.</ref> ''War Cry'' was sold by [[Officer of The Salvation Army|Salvation Army officers]] and the [[working poor]] to draw peoples' attention to the poor living conditions of of these individuals. Another precursor to the modern street newspaper was ''Hobo News'', which ran from 1915 to 1930;<ref group=note>Another author claims the paper had a shorter lifespan, running "from the late 1910s to the early 1920s" (Heinz 2004:534).</ref> ''Hobo News'' featured writing from prominent labor and social activists and [[Industrial Workers of the World]] members alongside contributions of oral history, creative writing, and artwork from hoboes.<ref name=Howley63>Howley 2005:63.</ref> Another influential paper was ''[[The Catholic Worker]]'', founded in 1933;<ref name=Heinz535/> this and most other street papers published before 1970 were affiliated with [[religious organization]]s.<ref name=NASNA/> Like workers' papers and other forms of [[alternative media]] in the late 1800s and early 1900s, early street newspapers were often created because the founders believed mainstream news did not cover issues that were relevant to ordinary people.<ref name=Heinz524>Heinz 2004:534.</ref>

===Modern street newspapers===
Modern street newspapers began to emerge in the [[United States]] in the late 1980s, in response to increasing levels of homelessness and homeless advocates' dissatisfaction over the [[mainstream media]]'s portrayal of the homeless.<ref name=Heinz535>Heinz 2004:535.</ref><ref name=Green47>Green 1998:47.</ref> ''Street News,'' founded in late 1989 in New York City, is normally cited as the first "modern" street newspaper.<ref name=CSM>{{cite web | last=Harman | first=Danna | date=17 November 2003 | accessdate=13 January 2009 | title=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1117/p13s01-lihc.html | title=Read all about it: street papers flourish across the US}} [http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1117/p13s01-lihc.htm Archived version]</ref><ref name=Sthlm/><ref name=UNESCO>{{cite web | last=Boukhari | first=Sophie | title=The press takes to the street | url=http://www.unesco.org/courier/1999_02/uk/connex/txt1.htm | publisher=[[UNESCO]] | work=[[The UNESCO Courier]] | date=15 May 2001}}</ref><ref name=review/><ref name=Heinz536/><ref group=note>Although [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]]'s ''Homeless Times'' was founded before it, ''Street News'' is the earliest-published paper that is still active (North American Street Newspaper Association 2008).</ref>  Many more street papers were launched in the 1989 and the early 1990s,<ref name=UNESCO/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sf-homeless-coalition.org/eng/about/#strshe | accessdate=13 January 2009 | title=Get Acquainted | publisher=[[Coalition on Homelessness, San Francisco]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The Big Issue History | url=http://www.bigissue.com/History_34.php | accessdate=13 January 2009 | publisher=[[The Big Issue]]}}</ref> crediting the high-profile New York paper as their inspiration; during the early 1990s, an average of five new papers were created every year.<ref name=NASNA/><ref name=CSM/> The rapid growth in the number of street newspapers has been attributed to both changing attitudes and policies towards homeless individuals, and to the ease of publishing provided by desktop computers;<ref name=CSM/><ref name=NASNA/> William Shaw, the editor of the [[Phillipines]]' ''Jeepney'', has also claimed that government support, especially in the [[western world]], has been influential in allowing street newspapers to thrive in the west.<ref name=phil/> Since 1989, the concept has spread to include at least 100 papers<ref name=PBS>{{cite web | title=Street News (transcript) | date=15 December 2004 | url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/media/july-dec04/streetnews_12-15.html | accessdate=12 February 2009 | work=[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]] | publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]}}</ref> in over 30 countries.<ref name="members">The [[International Network of Street Papers]] alone has 94 member papers across 36 countries. {{cite web | url=http://www.street-papers.org/our-street-papers/ | title=Our Street Papers | publisher=[[International Network of Street Papers]] | accessdate=2009-02-11}}</ref> In 2008, an estimated 32 million people worldwide read street newspapers, and 250,000 poor, disadvantaged, or homeless individuals sold or contributed to them.<ref name=phil/>
