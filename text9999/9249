The '''Mono-Inyo Craters''' are a north<U+2013>south-trending volcanic chain in [[Eastern California]] that stretch {{convert|25|mi|km}} from the northwest shore of [[Mono Lake]] to south of [[Mammoth Mountain]]. The chain is located in [[Mono County, California|Mono County]] in the [[U.S. State]] of California. '''Mono Lake Volcanic Field''' forms the northernmost part of the chain and consists of two volcanic islands in the lake and one [[cinder cone]] volcano on its northwest shore. Most of the '''Mono Craters''', which make up the bulk of the northern part of the Mono-Inyo chain, are [[phreatic eruption|phreatic]] (steam explosion) volcanoes that have since been either plugged or over-topped by [[rhyolite]] domes and lava flows. '''Inyo Craters''' form much of the southern part of the chain and consist of phreatic explosion pits, and rhyolitic lava flows and domes. The southernmost part of the chain consists of [[fumarole]]s and explosion pits on Mammoth Mountain and of a set of cinder cones south of the mountain; the latter set is called the [[Red Cones]]. 

Eruptions along the narrow fissure system under the chain began in the west moat of [[Long Valley Caldera]] 400,000 to 60,000 years ago. Mammoth Mountain was formed during this period. Multiple eruptions from 40,000 to 600 years ago created Mono Craters and eruptions 5,000 to 500 years ago formed Inyo Craters. Lava flows 5,000 years ago built the Red Cones, and explosion pits on Mammoth Mountain were excavated in the last 1,000 years. Uplift of [[Paoha Island]] in Mono Lake about 250 years ago is the most recent activity. These eruptions most likely originated from small magma bodies rather than from a single, large [[magma chamber]] like the one that produced the massive Long Valley Caldera eruption 760,000 years ago. During the past 3,000 years, eruptions have occurred every 250 to 700 years. In 1980, a series of earthquakes and uplift within and south of Long Valley Caldera indicated renewed activity along the chain.

The area has been used by humans for centuries. [[Obsidian]] was collected by [[Mono tribe|Mono Paiutes]] for making sharp tools and arrow points. Glassy rock continues to be removed in modern times for use as commercial scour and yard decoration. [[Mono Mills, California|Mono Mills]] processed timber felled on or near the volcanoes for the nearby boomtown [[Bodie, California|Bodie]] in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. Water diversions into the [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]] system from their natural outlets in Mono Lake started in 1941 after a water tunnel was cut under Mono Craters. Mono Lake Volcanic Field and a large part of Mono Craters gained some protection under [[Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area]] in 1984. Resource use along all of the chain is managed by the [[United States Forest Service]] as part of [[Inyo National Forest]]. Various activities are possible along the chain, including hiking, bird watching, canoeing, skiing, and mountain biking. 

==Geography and description==
===Setting===
Mono-Inyo Craters form a volcanic chain in [[Eastern California]] that sit along a narrow, north<U+2013>south-trending fissure system that extends from the north shore of [[Mono Lake]], through the western moat of [[Long Valley Caldera]], and south of [[Mammoth Mountain]].<ref name="USGSGeoHis"/> The chain is located in [[Inyo National Forest]] and [[Mono County, California]], and the nearest incorporated community is [[Mammoth Lakes, California]]. Mono Craters are located in [[Mono Basin]], itself part of the [[Great Basin]].

[[File:Mono Craters airphoto by Von Huene 032079.jpg|thumb|alt=Chain of tall hills with sharp peaks. A crater and lake are in the foreground.|Mono Craters form an arc of overlapping lava domes and flows.]]
Mono Craters are a {{convert|10.5|mi|km|adj=on|sigfig=2}} chain of at least 27 volcanic domes, three large glass flows called [[coulee]]s and various explosion pits and other associated volcanic features.<ref name="Sharp1997p289">{{harvnb|Sharp|1997|p=289}}</ref> The domes of the chain lie on a roughly north<U+2013>south-trending arc that is concave to the west and located south of Mono Lake. The highest of the Mono Domes is Crater Mountain (elevation 9,172&nbsp;feet or 2,796&nbsp;m), which rises {{convert|2400|ft|m}} above Pumice Valley to the west.<ref name="Sharp1997p290"/> Associated volcanic features are located in Mono Lake ([[Paoha Island|Paoha]] and [[Negit Island]]s) and on its north shore (Black Point). The coulees cluster north and south of the overlapping chain of domes. Craters exist at the top of most domes and on flat land south of them. 

[[File:Inyo craters.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two craters in a forested area and one crater on top of a large hill. A hummocky massive but flat hill is in the background.|Inyo Craters are a set of explosion pits and flows of glassy lava.]]
The two southernmost Inyo Craters are open pits in a forested area that are about {{convert|600|ft|m|-1}} across and {{convert|100|to|200|ft|m|sigfig=1}} deep, each with small ponds covering their floors.<ref name="Sharp1997p252">{{harvnb|Sharp|1997|p=252}}</ref> A quarter mile (half kilometer) north of these is another Inyo explosion pit on top of Deer Mountain. Farther north of these craters are five [[lava dome]]s, including Deadman Creek Dome, Glass Creek Dome, Obsidian Dome, and Wilson Butte. These domes are composed of gray [[rhyolite]], frothy [[pumice]], and black [[obsidian]]. The Mono-Inyo Craters volcanic chain extends into Long Valley Caldera but is not related to the caldera's volcanism.<ref name="Sharp1997p290">{{harvnb|Sharp|1997|p=290}}</ref> 

South of Inyo Craters proper are other features related to the [[dike (geology)|dike]] system responsible for creating the craters, volcanoes and lava flows. These include a north<U+2013>south trend of [[fault scarp]]s up to {{convert|20|ft|m|sigfig=1}} high and pull-apart cracks or fissures in the earth.<ref name="Sharp1997p253">{{harvnb|Sharp|1997|p=253}}</ref> These fissures are not technically [[fault (geology)|fault]]s because little or no vertical or horizontal movement has occurred along them.<ref name="Sharp1997p254">{{harvnb|Sharp|1997|p=254}}</ref> Most notable among these is "Earthquake Fault", a fissure up to {{convert|10|ft|m|sigfig=1}} wide that cuts {{convert|60|to|70|ft|m}} into glassy rhyolite lava flows.<ref name="Sharp1997p253"/> Stairs to the bottom of the fissure were removed after being damaged by earthquakes in 1980.<ref name="Sharp1997p253"/> 
Several Mono-Inyo-related explosion pits are on Mammoth Mountain.<ref name="USGS8000years"/> The Red Cones, south of Mammoth Mountain, are basaltic [[cinder cone]]s and are the southernmost part of the Mono-Inyo Craters volcanic chain.<ref name="USGS8000years"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lvo.wr.usgs.gov/gallery/30714277-099_caption.html|title=Red Cones, Long Valley area, California|coauthors=USGS Contributors|date=October 1999|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=2009-12-13}}</ref>

===Typical evolution===
[[File:Panum Crater.jpg|thumb|alt=Ring of gray rock with a dome of gray rock inside it.|Aerial photo of Panum Crater]]
[[Panum Crater]] is the northernmost volcano in the sequence and is a good example of both a [[tuff ring]] and a rhyolite dome. Its structure is two-fold; an outer tuff ring (forming a classic crater) and an inner plug, or dome of rhyolite, pumice and obsidian created from lavas.<ref name="Koningsmark2002p137">{{harvnb|Koningsmark|2002|p=137}}</ref> In this case, heat from the magma feeding Panum flashed groundwater to steam to create the tuff ring before lava reached the surface. Other Mono Craters also were formed in this manner, but their plug domes grew larger than their tuff ring craters. The domes have steep sides and are flanked by slopes of [[scree]] consisting of large angular and glass-rich rocks.<ref name="Sharp1997p291">{{harvnb|Sharp|1997|p=291}}</ref> Devil's Punch Bowl, located south of the main dome complex, stopped forming at an earlier stage of development.

[[File:Mono Craters - Northwest Coulee from CA 120.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Steep-sided large pile of dark gray sharp rock in a field of scrub vegetation.|Northwest Coulee]] 
The large North and South Coulee and the smaller Northwest Coulee consist of obsidian-rich rhyolite. They were formed from slow-moving lava that had a thin and brittle crust. Once the flow stopped, it formed steep sided tongues of sharp and angular rock that are typically {{convert|200|to|300|ft|m|sigfig=1}} thick and have scree piles along their base.<ref name="Sharp1997p294">{{harvnb|Sharp|1997|p=294}}</ref> South Coulee is {{convert|2.25|mi|km|sigfig=2}} long, {{convert|0.75|mi|km|sigfig=2}} wide and has a volume of {{convert|0.1|mi3|km3|sigfig=1}}; making it the largest Mono coulee in volume.<ref>{{harvnb|Sharp|1997|pp=294<U+2013>295}}</ref> South Coulee originates from the crest of Mono Domes, about {{convert|3|mi|km|sigfig=1}} from the southern end, flows down its east and west flanks and terminates at its foot.<ref name="Sharp1997p294"/> North Coulee is nearly as large, flows mostly to the east and terminates in a divided pair of lobes.

==Geology==
===Background===
The Mono-Inyo chain of craters lies in east-central California, roughly parallel to the eastern [[escarpment]] of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain range. Volcanism and seismic activity in eastern California are a result of two major geologic processes: northwest movement of the [[Pacific Plate]] with respect to the [[North American Plate]] along the [[San Andreas Fault]] system near the coast, and east&ndash;west extension of the crust that formed the [[Basin and Range Province]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|2002|pp=21<U+2013>22}}</ref> In the Long Valley region, where the craters are located, [[basin and range]] extension encroaches onto the thick and stable crust of the Sierra Nevada.<ref name="long_valley_overview">{{cite journal|last=Hill|first=D.

===Human use===
People have used resources on and around the Mono-Inyo Craters for centuries. [[Mono tribe|Mono Paiutes]] gathered [[obsidian]] from the Mono-Inyo Craters to make sharp tools and arrow points.<ref>{{cite book|title= History of the Sierra Nevada|last=Farquhar|first=Francis P.|page=12|year=2007|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NYNkTjLYeYAC&source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher=University of California Press|edition=2nd|isbn=0520253957}}</ref> Unworked obsidian was carried by the Mono Paiutes over passes in the Sierra Nevada to trade with other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] groups.

A building and set of trees is on top of the hill. A rail line parallels the chords of wood.|Mono Mills processed wood near Mono Domes for use in the boomtown of Bodie.]]
[[Gold rush]]-related [[boomtown]]s sprang up near Mono Basin in the 19th century to exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, [[Bodie, California|Bodie]] (north of Mono Lake), was founded in the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at [[Mono Mills, California|Mono Mills]], immediately northeast of Mono Domes.<ref>{{cite book|title = Bodie: Boom Town <U+2013> Gold Town!|last = McDonald|first = Douglas|year = 1988|publisher = Nevada Publications, in cooperation with the Friends of Bodie|location = Las Vegas, Nevada|isbn = 0913814881}}</ref> Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill. 

As part of the [[California Water Wars]], the [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power]] purchased large tracts of land in the 1930s within Mono Basin and [[Owens Valley]] in order to control [[water right]]s.<ref name="Sharp1997p296">{{harvnb|Sharp|1997|p=296}}</ref> Excavation of an {{convert|11.5|mi|km|adj=on}} water tunnel under the southern part of the Mono dome complex started in 1934 and was completed in 1941.<ref name="Tierney2000p51">{{harvnb|Tierney|2000|p=51}}</ref> Tunnel workers had to deal with loose and often water-charged gravels, pockets of [[carbon dioxide]] gas and flooding. About one man was lost for each mile excavated.<ref name="Tierney2000p51"/> Water diverted from its natural outlet in Mono Lake passes through the tunnel on its way to the [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]] system. 

The United States Pumice Company, based in [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California|Chatsworth, California]], has mined the area for [[pumice]] since 1941.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspumice.com/about_us.html|title=About Us|publisher=United States Pumice Company|accessdate=2009-11-01}}</ref> The company markets the pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring and in large irregular chunks sold as yard decoration.<ref name="Sharp1997p291"/> 

Exploratory drilling for [[geothermal power]] occurred near Mono Craters on the south shore of Mono Lake in 1971.<ref>{{harvnb|Tierney|2000|p=68}}</ref> The wells did not show promising results, so the effort was abandoned.

===Early impressions===
The chain of craters has been the subject of several writers and naturalists. [[Mark Twain]] visited Mono Basin in the 1860s and wrote about Mono Lake, but did not mention any of the Mono-Inyo Craters except for the lake's two volcanic islands. He wrote in ''[[Roughing It]]'' (1872) that the lake was in a "lifeless, hideous desert ..." that was the "loneliest spot on earth ... little graced with the picturesque."<ref>{{cite book|title=Roughing It|last=Twain|first=Mark|year = 1913|page = 250|edition = Scholarly|publisher = University of California Press|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=OAZEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA259&dq=%22Mono+Lake%22+%22Mark+Twain%22&ei=kmsJS4qhA4WIygS3wrW0Dw#v=onepage&q=&f=false|isbn=0195159799}}</ref>

[[File:Mono Craters by John Muir.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two peaks with steep slopes that have trees on them.|Drawing of Mono Craters by John Muir]]
Naturalist [[John Muir]] explored the area in 1869. He  described the "Mono Desert" as a "... country of wonderful contrasts. Hot deserts bounded by snow-laden mountains,<U+2014>cinders and ashes scattered on glacier-polished pavements,<U+2014>frost and fire working together in the making of beauty. In the lake are several volcanic islands, which show that the waters were once mingled with fire." <ref name="Muir1911">{{cite book|last=Muir|first=John|pages=307<U+2013>308|title=My first summer in the Sierra|year=1911|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company, The Univeristy Press Cambridge|location=Boston and New York|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ymNIAAAAMAAJ|isbn=1883011248}}</ref>  Muir described the Mono Craters as "... heaps of loose ashes that have never been blest by either rain or snow ..."<ref name="Muir1911"/>

In the spring of 1881 and the fall of 1882, geologist [[Israel Russell]] studied the area as a side-trip during his field research of [[Lake Lahontan]]; a now dry lake that covered much of nearby Nevada during the last [[glacial period]].<ref>{{harvnb|Russell|1889|p=267}}</ref> His ''Quaternary History of the Mono Valley'' (1889), which included a topographic survey by Willard D. Johnson, was the first thorough scientific description of Mono Lake and its volcanic features. 

Russell named the Mono Craters and wrote; "The attention of every one who enters Mono Valley is at once attracted by the soft, pleasing colors of these craters as well as by the symmetry and beauty of their forms. They are exceptional features in the scenery of the region, and are rendered all the more striking by their proximity to the angular peaks and rugged outlines of the High Sierra."<ref>{{harvnb|Russell|1889|p=378}}</ref>

==Volcanic hazards==
[[File:Mono Lake - Paoha Island.JPG|thumb|300px|alt=Gray and white long, island in a lake.|The creation of Paoha Island 250 years ago was the most recent activity along the chain.]]
The Long Valley to Mono Lake region is one of three areas in California that are in the United States Geological Survey's volcanic hazards program.<ref group = note> The other two areas are the [[Geology of the Lassen volcanic area|Mount Lassen area]] and [[Mount Shasta]].</ref><ref name="Rinehart1982p52">{{harvnb|Rinehart|1982|p=52}}</ref> These areas are in the program because they have been active in the last 2,000 years and have the ability to produce explosive eruptions.<ref name="Rinehart1982p52"/> 

About 20 eruptions have occurred on the Mono-Inyo Craters chain at intervals of 250 to 700 years during the past 5,000 years.<ref name="Hill2002p24"/> Seismic soundings and lava composition indicate that these eruptions most likely originated from discrete and small magma bodies.<ref name="USGSGeoHis"/> The rate of eruption over the last 1,000 years has increased, with at least 12&nbsp;eruptions occurring.<ref name="Harris2005p67"/> 

All eruptions in the past 5,000 years from the Mono-Inyo Craters have expelled less than {{convert|0.25|mi3|km3|sigfig=1}}<!--Cited value is "1 km<U+00B3>"--> of [[magma]].<ref name="USGShazards">{{cite web|title= Volcano-Hazard Zones for Small- to Moderate-sized Eruptions in the Long Valley <U+2013> Mono Lake Area, California|url = http://lvo.wr.usgs.gov/zones/index.html|accessdate = 2009-12-13|author=USGS contributors|year=1999|location=Menlo Park, California|publisher=United States Geological Survey}}</ref> Future eruptions in the area will likely be similar in size to the small to moderate events of the past 5,000 years.<ref name="USGShazards"/> There is a one in 200 chance (0.5%) per year of an eruption occurring along the chain.<ref name="Hill2002p24"/> An eruption in the foreseeable future is probably more likely along the Mono-Inyo chain than an unrelated eruption inside Long Valley Caldera.<ref name=long_valley_overview/>

===Effects===
[[File:FutureMono-InyoTephraFall.gif|thumb|300px|alt=Map of California with concentric rings centered on the central eastern edge of the state. Reno, Sacramento and Fresno are in the largest circle.|Potential thickness of [[tephra]] on the ground from eruptions of less than {{convert|0.25|mi3|km3|sigfig=1}}]]
A wide range of effects are expected from future eruptions along the Mono-Inyo Craters. Ash and rock fragments (tephra) may accumulate to a thickness of {{convert|33|ft|m|sigfig=1}}<!--Cited value is "10 m"--> near an erupting Mono-Inyo vent.<ref name="USGShazards"/> Downwind accumulations of tephra may exceed {{convert|8|in|cm}}<!--Cited value is "20 cm"--> at a distance of {{convert|22|mi|km}}<!--Cited value is "35 km"--> and {{convert|2|in|cm|sigfig=1}}<!--Cited value is "5 cm"--> at {{convert|53|mi|km}}<!--Cited value is "85 km"-->.<ref name="Miller1982p8"/> Winds in the area tend to blow toward an east or northeasterly direction more than 50 percent of the time, and toward any easterly direction more than 80 percent of the time.<ref name="Miller1982p8"/> Grain size and thickness of tephra generally decreases gradually with distance from a vent. Volcanic ash will likely contaminate air routes east of the vent.<ref name="USGShazards"/>

Severe damage from super-heated flows of gas, ash and pulverized rock ([[pyroclastic flow]]s and surges) may occur at least {{convert|9.3|mi|km|sigfig=2}}<!--Cited value is "15 km"--> from an explosive eruption.<ref name="Miller1982p8">{{harvnb|Miller|1982|p=8}}</ref> The amount of damage depends on vent location, topography, and volume of magma erupted. Pyroclastic flows from vents on Mammoth Mountain or other high vent could travel farther by gaining extra momentum from their descent. Valleys along the route will be more impacted than ridges but flows and surges could overtop some ridges. Eruptions near snowpacks may produce [[lahar]]s of mud and ash that devastate valleys and watersheds. Steam blast eruptions under a lake could form large waves capable of flooding nearby areas and starting mudflows.<ref>{{harvnb|Miller|1982|p=7}}</ref> 

[[File:Mammoth Mountain from the top of Deer Mountain.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Tall mountain with a wide base and snow interrupted with gray to brown outcrops of rock. Forested area in the fore to mid-ground.|Pyroclastic flows from Mammoth Mountain or other steep-sided volcano will travel farther than flows originating from shorter features.]]
Basalt lava flows may extend more than {{convert|30|mi|km|sigfig=1}}<!--Cited value is "50 km"--> from their vent.<ref name="Miller1982p5">{{harvnb|Miller|1982|p=5}}</ref> Dacite and rhyolite lavas produce short, thick flows that rarely extend more than {{convert|3|mi|km|sigfig=1}}<!--Cited value is "5 km"--> from their vent.<ref name="Miller1982p5"/> Mound-shaped features called lava domes are often created from these flows. Rock fragments thrown from a growing lava dome may reach {{convert|3|to|6|mi|km|sigfig=1}}<!--Cited value is "5 to 10 km"--> from the dome.<ref name="USGShazards"/> A partial collapse of the steep-sided growing dome can send pyroclastic flows outward at least {{convert|3|mi|km|sigfig=1}}<!--Cited value is "5 km"-->.<ref name="USGShazards"/> Taller domes tend to form larger pyroclastic flows that travel farther.

==Activities==
Many recreational activities are available along the chain. The Mono Basin National Scenic Area visitor center is located near Mono Lake just off [[U.S. Route 395 in California|U.S. Route 395]]. A bookstore, an information desk staffed by USDA Forest Service Rangers and museum exhibits help to orient visitors.<ref name="InyoAbout"/> The [[Mono Lake Committee]] has a staffed office and visitor information center in [[Lee Vining, California|Lee Vining]] on the corner of U.S. Route 395 and 3rd Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monolake.org/visit/|title=Visit Mono Lake|publisher=Mono Lake Committee|accessdate=2009-11-01}}</ref> Information on camping, hiking, guided and self-guided tours can all be obtained at either location.
