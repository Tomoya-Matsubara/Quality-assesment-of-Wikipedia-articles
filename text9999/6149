'''"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power"''' is a ''[[TIME]]'' magazine article highly critical of [[Scientology]] that was first published on [[May 6]], [[1991]] as an eight-page cover story.<ref name="time">{{cite news | last = Behar | first = Richard | coauthors = | title = Scientology: The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power | work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = [[May 6]], [[1991]] | url =  http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972865,00.html | accessdate =  2007-10-25}}</ref><ref name="healy" />  Written by [[investigative journalist]] [[Richard Behar]], the article was later published in ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' in October 1991.<ref>{{cite news | last = Staff | first = | coauthors = | title = A Dangerous Cult Goes Mainstream | work = [[Readers Digest]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = October 1991 | url = http://www.skeptictank.org/hs/dancult.htm | accessdate =  2007-10-25}}</ref>  Behar had previously published an article on Scientology in ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine.  He stated that he was investigated by attorneys and private investigators affiliated with the [[Church of Scientology]] while researching the ''TIME'' article, and that investigators contacted his friends and family as well.  Behar's article covers topics including: [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and the development of Scientology, its [[Scientology controversy|controversies]] over the years and [[Scientology and the legal system|history of litigation]], [[Scientology and psychiatry|conflict with psychiatry]] and the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], the suicide of a [[Scientologist]], its [[Scientology as a state-recognized religion|status as a religion]], and its [[Scientology as a business|business dealings]].

After the article's publication, the Church of Scientology mounted a public relations campaign to inform the public of what it felt were falsehoods in the piece.  It took out advertisements in ''[[USA Today]]'' for twelve weeks, and Church leader [[David Miscavige]] was interviewed by [[Ted Koppel]] on ''[[Nightline]]'' about what he considered to be an objective bias by the article's author.  Miscavige alleged that the article was actually driven by the company [[Eli Lilly]], because of Scientology's efforts against the drug [[Prozac]].  The Church of Scientology brought a [[libel]] suit against [[Time Warner]] and Behar, and sued ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' in multiple countries in [[Europe]] in an attempt to stop the article's publication there.  The suit against Time Warner was dismissed in 1996, and the Church of Scientology's petition for a writ of [[certiorari]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in the case was denied in 2001.  

Behar received awards in honor of his work on the article, including the [[Gerald Loeb Award]], the [[Worth Bingham Prize]], and the [[Conscience-in-Media Award]].  In commentary on the piece, the book ''Let Them Eat Prozac'' was critical, and the book ''Unsecular Media'' characterized one of the segments of the article an [[atrocity tale]].  The article has had ramifications in the current treatment of Scientology in the media, with some publications theorizing that journalists are wary of the litigation that Time Warner went through.  The article has been cited by [[Anderson Cooper]] on [[CNN]], in a story on ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'''s 2007 program "[[Scientology and Me]]" on the [[BBC]], and has been used as a reference for background on the history of Scientology, in books from both the [[cult]] and [[new religious movement]] perspectives.

Before penning "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power", Behar had written a 1986 article in ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, "The Prophet and Profits of Scientology", which reported on the [[Church of Scientology]]'s business dealings and [[L.

While none of the parties assigned blame, they expressed misgivings about his death.  Initially, his father had thought that [[Scientology]] was similar to [[Dale Carnegie]]'s techniques; however, after his ordeal, Dr. Lottick came to believe that the organization is a "school for psychopaths".<ref name="leisure96">{{cite court |litigants= Church of Scientology International v.

=== Church of Scientology's response ===
The [[Church of Scientology]] responded to the publication of "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power" by taking out color full-page ads in ''[[USA Today]]'' in May and June 1991, on every weekday for twelve weeks, protesting the ''TIME'' magazine cover article.<ref>{{cite news | last = Staff | first = | coauthors = | title = Scientology's Critical Ads | work = [[The New York Times]] | pages = Section D, Page 5, Column 1, 342 words | language = | publisher = [[The New York Times Company]] | date = [[May 31]], [[1991]] | url = | accessdate =  }}</ref>  Two official Church of Scientology responses were titled "Facts vs. Fiction, A Correction of Falsehoods Contained in the May 6, 1991 Issues of ''TIME Magazine''", and "The Story That ''TIME'' Couldn't Tell".<ref name="miller">{{cite book | last = Miller | first = Timothy | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = America's Alternative Religions | publisher = SUNY Press | date = 1995 | location = | pages = Page 390 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0791423980}} </ref>  Prior to the advertising campaign, Scientologists distributed 88-page bound booklets which disputed points from Behar's article.<ref name="krueger">{{cite news   | last =Krueger  | first =Curtis  | coauthors =  | title =Scientology lambasts Time magazine in ad  | work =[[St. Petersburg Times]]  | pages =Page 1B  | language =  | publisher =  | date =[[May 29]], [[1991]]  | url = | accessdate =  }}</ref>  The "Fact vs. Fiction" piece was a quarter-inch thick booklet, which criticized Behar's article and asserted "Behar's article omits the information on the dozens of community service programs conducted by Scientologists ... which have been acknowledged by community officials".<ref name="cote">{{cite news | last =Cote  | first =Neil  | coauthors =  | title =Church whiffs while trying to whomp Wogs  | work =[[The Tampa Tribune]]  | pages = Page 1 | language =  | publisher =  | date =[[May 10]], [[1991]]  | url =  | accessdate =  }}</ref>  One of the advertisements in ''USA Today'' accused ''TIME'' of promoting [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazi Germany]], and featured a 1936 issue of ''TIME'' which had Hitler's picture on the front cover.<ref name="duckworth">{{cite news   | last =Duckworth  | first =Erika N.  | coauthors =  | title =Church of Scientology Attacks TIME  | work =Greensboro News & Record  | pages =Page B3  | language =  | publisher =  | date =[[May 29]], [[1991]]  | url =  | accessdate = }}</ref>  The Church of Scientology sent out a news release condemning ''TIME''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s "horrible history of supporting fascism," and said that the article was written because ''TIME'' had been pressured by "vested interests".<ref name="krueger" />  When asked by the ''St. Petersburg Times'' if this was the case, ''TIME'' Executive Editor Richard Duncan responded "Good Lord, no".<ref name="krueger" />  [[Heber Jentzsch]], at the time president of Church of Scientology International, released a four-page news release which stated "Advertising is the only way the church could be assured of getting its message and its side of the story out to the public without the same vested interests behind the Time article distorting it".<ref name="duckworth" />  

After the advertising run critiquing ''TIME'' magazine in ''USA Today'' had completed, the Church of Scientology mounted a [[USD|USD$]]3 million public relations campaign about Scientology in ''USA Today'', in June 1991.<ref name="holifield">{{cite news   | last =Holifield  | first =Rhonda  | coauthors =  | title =Scientologists answer critics with advertising  | work =[[St. Petersburg Times]]  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date =[[June 29]], [[1991]]  | url = | accessdate =  }}</ref>  The Church of Scientology placed a 48-page advertising supplement in 1.8 million copies of ''USA Today''.<ref name="holifield" />  In a statement to the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'', Scientology spokesman Richard Haworth explained "What we are trying to do is put the actual facts of dianetics and Scientology out there".<ref name="holifield" /> 

In response to the Church of Scientology's claims of inaccuracies in the article, a lawyer for ''TIME'' responded "We've reviewed all of their allegations, and find nothing wrong with the Time story."<ref name="howard">{{cite news   | last =Howard  | first =Lucy  | coauthors =Gregory Cerio  | title =Scientology Takes On Time  | work =[[Newsweek]]  | pages =Page 8  | language =  | publisher =[[The Washington Post Company]]  | date =[[June 10]], [[1991]]  | url =  | accessdate =  }}</ref>  In June 1991, ''[[Newsweek]]'' reported that staffers for ''TIME'' said they had received calls from a man claiming to be a [[paralegal]] for ''TIME'', who asked them if they had signed a confidentiality form about the article.<ref name="howard" />  ''TIME'' editors sent staffers a computer memo, warning them about calls related to the article, and staffers told ''Newsweek'' that "sources named in the story say detectives have asked about their talks with Time".<ref name="howard" />  A Church of Scientology spokesman called the claims "scurrillous".<ref name="howard" />

On [[February 14]], [[1992]], Church leader [[David Miscavige]] gave [[Ted Koppel]] his first interview on Scientology on the [[ABC News]] program ''[[Nightline]]''.<ref name="abcnews">{{cite news | last = Staff | first = | coauthors = [[Ted Koppel]], Forest Sawyer, (original broadcast, 02/14/1992.) | title = Scientology Leader Gave ABC First-Ever Interview: David Miscavige, Scientology Leader and Best Man at Tom Cruise's Wedding, Spoke to ABC News' 'Nightline' in 1992 | work = [[ABC News]] | pages = 1, 3 | language = | publisher = [[American Broadcasting Company]] | date = [[November 18]], [[2006]] | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=2664713&page=1 | accessdate = 2007-10-25 }}</ref>  The program noted that Scientology has vocal critics and cited Behar's 1991 article.  Behar appeared on the program and gave his opinion of why individuals join Scientology, stating that the "ulterior motive" is really to get people to take high-priced [[Auditing (Scientology)|audit counseling]].<ref name="abcnews" />  Behar stated on the program that he had evidence that members of the Church of Scientology had obtained his personal phone records.<ref name="abcnews" />  Later in the program, Koppel questioned Miscavige on the Church of Scientology's response to the ''TIME'' magazine article, particularly the $3 million the church spent advertising in ''USA Today''.<ref name="abcnews" /> Miscavige explained that the first three weeks of the advertising campaign was meant to correct falsehoods from the ''TIME'' article, and the rest of the twelve-week campaign was dedicated to informing the public about Scientology.  Koppel asked Miscavige what specifically had upset him about the ''TIME'' article, and Miscavige called Behar "a hater".<ref name="abcnews" />  Miscavige noted that Behar had written an article on Scientology and the Internal Revenue Service three years before he began work on the ''TIME'' piece, and made allegations that Behar had attempted to get two Scientologists kidnapped.  When Koppel questioned Miscavige further on this, Miscavige said that individuals had contacted Behar after an earlier article, and Behar had told them to "kidnap Scientologists out".<ref name="abcnews" />  Koppel pressed further, noting that this was a serious charge to make, and asked Miscavige if his allegations were accurate, why he had not pressed charges for attempted kidnapping.  Miscavige said Koppel was "missing the issue," and said that his real point was that he thought the article was not an objective piece.<ref name="abcnews" />

Miscavige alleged on ''Nightline'' that the article itself was published from a request by [[Eli Lilly]], due to "the damage we had caused to their killer drug Prozac".<ref name="abcnews" />  When Koppel asked Miscavige if he had affidavits or evidence to this effect, Miscavige responded "You think they'd admit it?"<ref name="abcnews" />  Miscavige stated that "Eli Lilly ordered a reprint of 750,000&nbsp;copies of Time magazine before it came out," and that his attempts to investigate the matter with Eli Lilly and associated advertising companies were not successful.<ref name="abcnews" />

But of course their doctrine states that the purpose of a suit is to harass, not to win, so from that perspective they hurt us all.

In a February 1992 issue of ''TIME'', editor Elizabeth Valk congratulated Behar on his Conscience in Media Award, stating "Needless to say, we are delighted and proud".<ref name="valk" />  Valk noted that the honor had only been awarded seven times in the previous seventeen years of its existence.<ref name="valk" />  Managing editor Henry Muller also congratulated Behar in an April 1992 issue of ''TIME''.<ref name="muller">{{cite news | last = Muller | first = Henry | coauthors = | title = From the Managing Editor | work = [[TIME]] magazine | pages = | language = | publisher =  Time Inc. | date = April 13, 1992 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975279,00.html | accessdate =  2007-10-25}}</ref>

== Analysis ==
Several secondary sources have commented on the article and used it as a reference for background on Scientology.<ref name="healy" /><ref name="cooper" />  Not all analysis of the article has been positive.  David Healy's book criticizing the [[pharmaceutical industry]], ''Let Them Eat Prozac'', was critical of the ''TIME'' article, saying that "Even Saddam Hussein was portrayed less badly".  Healy addressed the article's claim that lawsuits were one of the Church's key tactics against enemies.  He noted that the [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights]] (CCHR), a Church of Scientology affiliated group discussed in the article, had filed a petition with the [[Food and Drug Administration]] inquiring what it was going to do about [[Prozac]].  Healy dismissed the notion that CCHR engaged in "orchestrated campaigns," writing that very few of the fifty lawsuits filed against Prozac were related to the Church of Scientology.<ref name="healy" />  Mark Silk criticized Behar's article in his book ''Unsecular Media: Making News of Religion in America''.<ref name="silk">{{cite book | last = Silk | first = Mark | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Unsecular Media: Making News of Religion in America | publisher = [[University of Illinois|University of Illinois Press]] | date = 1995 | location = | pages = Pages 96-97 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0252067428}}</ref>  Silk classified the work among what he referred to as the "false-prophecy topos," and characterized Behar's account of Noah Lottick's suicide as an [[atrocity tale]].<ref name="silk" />  

''Insane Therapy'' noted that Scientology "achieved more notoriety ... with the publication of the journalist Richard Behar's highly critical article".<ref name="ayella" />  ''[[Larson's Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality]]'' described the cover design of the article as it appeared in ''TIME'', writing that it "shouted" the headline from the magazine cover.<ref name="larson" />  In a 2005 piece, ''[[Salon.com]]'' magazine noted that for those interested in the Church of Scientology, the ''TIME'' article still remains a "milestone in news coverage," and that those who back the Church believe it was "an outrageously biased account".<ref name="salon">{{cite news | last = Strupp | first = Joe | coauthors = | title = The press vs. Scientology: After years of conflict, the church and the media seem to have reached a truce.

== Legacy ==
The Church of Scientology's use of private investigators was cited in a 1998 article in ''[[The Boston Herald]]'', and compared to Behar's experiences when researching "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power".<ref name="bostonherald" />  After the paper ran a five-part series of critical articles in 1998, Church of Scientology President [[Heber Jentzsch]] confirmed that a private investigative firm was hired to look into the personal life of Joseph Mallia, the reporter who wrote the articles.<ref name="bostonherald" />  In a later piece titled "Church of Scientology probes Herald reporter &mdash; Investigation follows pattern of harassment" this investigation was likened to Behar's assertions of harassment, as well as other reporters' experiences from 1974, 1988, and 1997.<ref name="bostonherald">{{cite news | last = MacLaughlin | first = Jim | coauthors = Andrew Gully | title = Church of Scientology probes Herald reporter &mdash; Investigation follows pattern of harassment. | work = [[The Boston Herald]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = [[March 19]], [[1998]] | url = | accessdate =  }}</ref>  

Due to the controversial history between ''Readers Digest'' and Scientology, the writer of a 2005 cover story on [[Tom Cruise]] agreed to certain demands, including giving Scientology issues equal play in the writer's profile of Cruise, submitting questions for Cruise to Church of Scientology handlers, and sending the writer of the article to a one-day Church immersion course.<ref>{{cite news | last = Staff | first = | coauthors = | title = Reader<U+2019>s Digest on Cruise Control | work = [[Radar (magazine)|Radar Magazine]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = [[June 8]], [[2005]] | url = http://www.radaronline.com/fresh-intelligence/2005/06/08/index.php | accessdate =  2007-10-25}}</ref>  Also in 2005, an article in ''Salon'' questioned whether the tactics of the Church's litigation and private investigations of Time Warner and other media sources had succeeded in decreasing the amount of investigative journalism pieces on Scientology in the press.<ref name="salon" /> A 2005 article in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' cited the article, and came to the determination that the Church of Scientology's lawsuit against Time Warner "served to warn off other potential investigations," and that "The chill evidently lingers still".<ref name="sundaytimes">{{cite news | last = Rowan | first = David | coauthors =  | title = Tom, three questions for you: The film star should be facing robust media interrogation about Scientology, but there is craven silence | work = [[The Sunday Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = [[News International|Times Newspapers Ltd.]] | date = [[July 12]], [[2005]] | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article542911.ece | accessdate =  2007-10-25}}</ref>

"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power" continues to be used today by journalists in the media, as a reference for historical information on the Church of Scientology.<ref>{{cite news   | last =O'Keefe  | first =Mark  | coauthors =  | title =Church of Scientology Is No Stranger to Criticism  | work =[[The Oregonian]]  | pages =Page A16  | language =  | publisher =  | date =[[September 26]], [[1996]]  | url =  | accessdate =  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news   | last =  | first =  | coauthors =  | title =SCIENCE FICTION? - Factual results needed from reading program  | work =[[The Commercial Appeal]]  | pages =Page A6  | language =  | publisher =  | date =[[September 5]], [[1995]]  | url =  | accessdate =  }}</ref><ref name="minneapolis">{{cite news | last = Estrada | first = Heron Marquez | coauthors = | title = Scientology: Fact or fiction?

In the interview, Anderson Cooper quoted directly from "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power" article, when asking Rinder about the history of [[Operation Snow White]], and if those tactics were currently used by the Church.<ref name="cooper" />  Rinder answered by stating that the individuals involved with Operation Snow White were no longer involved in Church of Scientology activities, and that the incident was "ancient history".  Cooper then again referenced the ''TIME'' magazine article noting that Behar asserted that he was illegally investigated by Scientology contacts during research for his article.<ref name="cooper" />  Cooper questioned Rinder on the dismissed lawsuit against [[Time Warner]], and Rinder acknowledged that all of the Church of Scientology's appeals against Time Warner were eventually thrown out.<ref name="cooper" />
