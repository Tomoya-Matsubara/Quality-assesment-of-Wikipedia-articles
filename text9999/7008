'''''Cannibal Holocaust''''' ([[1980 in film|1980]]) is a controversial [[exploitation film]] directed by [[Ruggero Deodato]] and based on a screenplay written by Gianfranco Clerici and Giorgio Stegani. Filmed in the actual [[Amazon Rainforest]], it focuses on a team of four documentarians who head deep into the jungle to make a [[documentary film|documentary]] on the primitive native tribes that live there. After two months and no word from the team, a famous [[anthropology|anthropologist]] is sent on a rescue mission in hopes of finding the team alive. The film stars [[Robert Kerman]] as the anthropologist Harold Monroe, Carl Gabriel Yorke as director Alan Yates, Francesca Ciardi as Alan's girlfriend Faye, Perry Pirkanen as the cameraman Jack Anders, and Luca Barbareschi as fellow cameraman Mark Tomaso.

''Cannibal Holocaust'' is one of the best known exploitation films due to the controversy it caused during its release. After premiering in [[Italy]], the film was seized by the local [[Magistrate]] and Deodato was arrested for obscenity. He was later accused of making a [[snuff film]] based on circulating rumors that the film's actors were slain for the camera. Though Deodato would be cleared of these charges, the film was banned in Italy, the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Australia]], and several other countries for graphic gore, sexual violence, and for the geniune slayings of six animals featured in the film.<ref>{{cite book | title=Video Recordings Act 1984 | publisher = The Stationery Office Books | year = 1984 | isbn = ISBN 0-10-543984-3}}</ref> While many nations have revoked the ban, it is still banned to this day in other countries around the world. Despite this notoriety, ''Cannibal Holocaust'' is seen by some critics as a social commentary on civilized society.<ref name="David Carter">{{cite web | url=http://www.savagecinema.com/cannibalholocaust.html | title=Savage Cinema | author=Carter, David | publisher=Savage Cinema | accessdate=2006-09-06}}</ref><ref name="Paly">{{cite web | url=http://voice.paly.net/view_story.php?id=4965 | title=A savage allegory | author=Sheldon, Sam | publisher=The Paly Voice | accessdate=2007-01-23}}</ref>

== Plot ==
There are two [[Chronology|timelines]] in the film: one timeline depicts Monroe's trip into the jungle to determine the fate of the young American explorers, and the other involves Monroe's subsequent viewing of the recovered films made by the missing explorers. Much of the film is the depiction of the recovered film's contents, which grow increasingly disturbing as they are revealed.

{{Spoiler}}

The film begins with a TV documentary about a missing film crew and its expedition into the Amazon Rainforest to make a documentary about primitive cannibal tribes: Alan Yates, the director; Faye Daniels, his girlfriend and script girl; and their two friends and cameramen, Jack Anders and Mark Tomaso. Professor Harold Monroe, an [[NYU]] anthropologist, volunteers to lead a rescue mission to find the team. He flies down to the Amazon and meets two guides who will help him in his mission: Chaco, a hardened jungle expert, and his capable assistant, Miguel. Thanks to the military, the group has a hostage from a tribe called the Yacumo to help them negotiate with the natives. After a long trek through the jungle, the group happens upon a Yacumo male raping and murdering his wife as a punishment for adultery. After he is finished, the group follows the lone Yacumo to a large clearing, where Miguel negotiates the release of their hostage if the Yacumo let them in their village.

Upon arriving to the village, the rescue team is greeted with hostility. It is soon revealed that the last white men to visit the tribe, the missing film team, caused great unrest; Miguel quells their fears by giving them a gift of good faith: a switchblade. The next day, the Yacumo leads the group to the edge of their territory, where two vicious cannibal tribes, the [[Yanomamo]] and [[Yanomaman languages|Shamatari]], are perpetually at war with each other. The group witnesses the death of a Yanomamo woman by hands of a group of Shamatari warriors, and then follows the warriors to a riverbank. Once there, Monroe's team rescues a small group of Yanomamo warriors from certain death threatened by the larger group of Shamatari. As a token of gratitude, the group is invited to the Yanomamo village, but, once there, the team is again treated with hostility. In an attempt to gain their trust, Monroe bathes naked in a river, which a small group of Yanomamo women find amusing. They lead Monroe to a [[shrine]] made out of the bones of the lost film team, confirming Monroe<U+2019>s worst fears. Frustrated, Monroe confronts the tribe in their village, and, after playing a tape recorder for them, the tribe agrees to exchange the tape recorder for the footage that the missing film team shot.

Once Monroe is back in [[New York City|New York]], the executives of the Pan American Broadcast Company inform him that they want Monroe to host their airings of the film team<U+2019>s documentary. Monroe asserts that he will only do it if he views the [[reel|film reels]] first. The executives agree, and, to introduce Monroe to the works of Alan Yates, they show him a short segment from one of the team<U+2019>s previous documentaries, ''The Last Road to Hell''. After viewing, a female executive tells him that the footage was staged by Yates to acquire more exciting footage. Puzzled, Monroe continues on to view the recovered footage.
[[Image:CannibalHolocaustimpale.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Detail of the iconic impalement scene.]]
The first film reel begins by showing the group<U+2019>s trek deep into the jungle, where they make camp and slaughter a turtle and cook its innards (this is the infamous turtle scene). The next day, the group<U+2019>s guide, Felipe, is bitten in the foot by a poisonous snake. Despite Jack cutting off his leg, Felipe dies. After burying him, the film team continues on to locate the Yacumo. They come across a small group of Yacumo in a clearing, where Jack shoots one in the leg so the group can follow him to the village at their leisure. As the projectionist changes reels, Monroe comments on his disapproval to the team's actions, stating they should have found other ways to introduce themselves to the tribe. The second reel then starts, showing the group<U+2019>s arrival at the village, where they almost immediately round up the entire tribe into a large hut and burn it down to stage a scene for their documentary, in which the Yacumo were slaughtered by the Yanomamo. Monroe expresses his concerns of the film's quality, as most of it has been staged, but his worries are ignored. He continues to view the reels the next day, in which the group films a pregnant Yacumo woman having her fetus forcibly removed.

At the station, Monroe expresses his disgust toward the station's decision to still air the footage. To change the executives<U+2019> minds, he volunteers to show them the unedited footage that only he has seen. The final two reels begin with the film team locating a young Yanomamo girl, whom the men [[rape|gang-rape]] as Faye tries to stop them (to no avail). The projectionist changes to the final reel, which begins with the group arriving at the site of where the same girl is impaled on a pole. The team films the impalement while claiming the natives killed her because of a <U+201C>bizarre sexual rite.<U+201D> After the group moves on, the Yanomamo attack them in vengeance for the girl<U+2019>s death. Jack is impaled by a spear, but instead of attempting rescue, Alan shoots him so he can film what the natives do to him. They film as Jack<U+2019>s corpse is immasculated and is then dismembered, cooked, and eaten. While the remaining three attempt escape after filming Jack<U+2019>s demise, Faye is captured by the Yanomamo, and Alan insists that he and Mark try to save her. Mark films as Faye is gang-raped and beheaded, afterwhich the cannibals locate the two in their hiding spot. The camera drops to the ground as Alan<U+2019>s bloody, blank face falls in front of the lens; the reels then end. At first silent, the executives order the footage to be burned as a successful Monroe leaves the station.

== Production ==
Production began in 1979, when Deodato was contacted by German film producers about making a film "like ''Cannibal Holocaust''." Deodato accepted and immediately went in search of a producer; he chose his friend Francesco Palaggi. The two men embarked to [[Colombia]] to scout for filming locations. Palaggi already had several locations in mind, specifically the locations where the film ''Queimada'' by Gillo Pontecorvo were shot. Deodato, however, did not agree, because there was not enough [[rainforest]] at the locations. After scouring much of the country, the frustrated men were ready to give up and went to the airport in [[Bogot<U+00E1>]] to fly back to [[Rome]]. While there, Deodato met a Colombian documentary maker, who suggested the city of [[Leticia, Colombia|Leticia]] as a filming location. Deodato proposed Leticia as a filming location to Palaggi, who grew upset since the two were already scheduled to arrive at Rome. He eventually agreed, and the project went ahead as planned.<ref name="In the Jungle">{{cite video | people = Deodato, Ruggero (interviewee) | year = 2003 | title = In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | accessdate = 2007-01-13 | medium = Documentary | location = Italy | publisher = Alan Young Pictures}}</ref>

To appeal to a wider audience, Deodato chose to make the film in [[English language|English]]. At the time, however, it was necessary for a European film to have a nationality, as to assure free circulation among European countries.<ref name="Euro">{{cite web |url=http://www.obs.coe.int/online_publication/reports/natfilm.html |title=Making and Distributing Films in Europe: the Problem of Nationality |author=Gyory, Michel |accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref> Under Italian law, in order for ''Cannibal Holocaust'' to be recognized as an Italian film, Deodato needed at least two actors who spoke [[Italian language|Italian]] as a native language to star in the movie.<ref name="In the Jungle">{{cite video | people = Deodato, Ruggero (interviewee) | year = 2003 | title = In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | accessdate = 2007-01-13 | medium = Documentary | location = Italy | publisher = Alan Young Pictures}}</ref><ref name="Euro">{{cite web |url=http://www.obs.coe.int/online_publication/reports/natfilm.html |title=Making and Distributing Films in Europe: the Problem of Nationality |author=Gyory, Michel |accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref> At the [[Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute|Strasberg Institute]] in New York, he found Luca Barbareschi and Francesca Ciardi, two Italian actors who also spoke English. Also at Strasberg, he hired Perry Pirkanen and another actor who would drop out at the last minute. To replace him, a casting director contacted several other actors, including Carl Gabriel Yorke, who would ultimately get the role. Yorke recalls that all of the costumes were already purchased for the film, including size 10<U+00BD> boots. Although other actors were considered for the part, he was given the role because he wore size 10<U+00BD> shoes.<ref name="Interview">{{cite interview |last=Yorke |first=Carl Gabriel |subject=Yorke, Carl Gabriel |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]] |title=Alan Yates Uncovered |city=Palo Alto, California |date=2005-05-12 |program=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Extras}}</ref> Robert Kerman was cast as Professor Harold Monroe because he and Deodato were previously acquainted; Kerman had played a role as an air traffic control man in Deodato's previous film, ''The Concorde Affair''.<ref name="Exposed">{{cite interview |last=Kerman |first=Robert |subjectlink=Robert Kerman |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]] |cointerviewers=[[Bob Murawski]] |title=Robert Kerman Exposed |city=Tarrytown, New York |date=2000-11-15 |program=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Extras}}</ref>
[[Image:CH-Piranha.jpg|right|thumb|210px|The missing piranha scene]]

The script was written by long-time Italian horror screenwriter Gianfranco Clerici, who had collaborated with Deodato in his previous film, ''[[Ultimo Mondo Cannibale (film)|Ultimo Mondo Cannibale]]''. There are several changes in the film from Clerici's original screenplay, including characters' names, especially in the film crew. Clerici also had originally written several scenes that are lacking from the film's final cut, the most famous of which involved a group of Yanomamo cutting off the leg of a Shamatari warrior and feeding him to piranha in the river. However, due to a malfunctioning [[underwater photography|underwater camera]] and because the [[piranha]] were difficult to control, the scene was dropped and filming was never finished. Photographs of the scene's partial execution were taken, which are the only known depiction of this scene in existence, despite several claims of the scene appearing in obscure VHS copies. Because of this, the "Piranha Scene" is a popular topic amongst fans of the film.<ref name="Interview 2">{{cite interview |last=Deodato |first=Ruggero |subjectlink=Ruggero Deodato |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]] | cointerviewers=[[Bob Murawski]] |title=Cult-Con 2000 |city=Tarrytown, New York |date=2000-11-12 |program=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Commentary}}</ref>

Filming began on [[June 4]], [[1979]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078935/business | title=Business Data for Cannibal Holocaust | publisher=Internet Movie Database | accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref>, but it was delayed for two weeks awaiting the arrival of Yorke.<ref name="Interview">{{cite interview |last=Yorke |first=Carl Gabriel |subject=Yorke, Carl Gabriel |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]] |title=Alan Yates Uncovered |city=Palo Alto, California |date=2005-05-12 |program=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Extras}}</ref> The scenes featuring the film team were shot first; afterwhich, Kerman flew down to film his scenes in the rainforest, and then to [[New York City|New York]] to film exterior shots in the city.

Tensions on the set were high, due in part to the location and to the content of the film itself. Yorke describes it as having "a level of cruelty unknown to me,"<ref name="Interview">{{cite interview |last=Yorke |first=Carl Gabriel |subject=Yorke, Carl Gabriel |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]] |title=Alan Yates Uncovered |city=Palo Alto, California |date=2005-05-12 |program=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Extras}}</ref> while Kerman described Deodato as unremorseful and uncaring.<ref name="Comment">{{cite interview |last=Kerman |first=Robert |subjectlink=Robert Kerman |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]] |cointerviewers=[[Bob Murawski]] |title=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Commentary |city=Tarrytown, New York |date=2000-11-12 |program=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Extras}}</ref> He and Deodato got into long, drawn out arguments every day of shooting, usually because of remarks from Deodato.<ref name="Comment">{{cite interview |last=Kerman |first=Robert |subjectlink=Robert Kerman |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]] |cointerviewers=[[Bob Murawski]] |title=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Commentary |city=Tarrytown, New York |date=2000-11-12 |program=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Extras}}</ref><ref name="Interview 2">{{cite interview |last=Deodato |first=Ruggero |subjectlink=Ruggero Deodato |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]] | cointerviewers=[[Bob Murawski]] |title=Cult-Con 2000 |city=Tarrytown, New York |date=2000-11-12 |program=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Commentary}}</ref> One particular aspect that led to disagreement amongst the crew was the filming of the genuine animal killings.

Actress Francesca Ciardi also had disagreements concerning the film's content. During the sex scene between her and Carl Yorke, she refused to comply with Deodato's instructions, leading to him dragging her off the set and screaming at her in Italian.<ref name="Interview">{{cite interview |last=Yorke |first=Carl Gabriel |subject=Carl Gabriel Yorke |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]] |title=Alan Yates Uncovered |city=Palo Alto, California |date=2005-05-12 |program=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Extras}}</ref> She had earlier suggested that the two actually have [[sexual intercourse|sex]] in the jungle before filming, in order relieve tension of the upcoming scene. When Yorke declined, she grew upset with him, alienating him for the rest of the shoot. Ciardi was also the butt of several jokes, including one involving several crew members leaving a real human [[skull]] half-buried in the mud for her to find, which resulted in a panic.<ref>{{cite video | people = Gelend, Antonio (interviewee) | year = 2003 | title = In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | medium = Documentary | location = Italy | publisher = Alan Young Pictures}}</ref>

The names of the tribes, the Yanomamo and Shamatari, are of real indigenous people in Brazil, though they are not fierce enemies as in the movie, nor is either tribe cannibalistic as depicted in the film (though the Yanomamo do partake in ritualistic post-mordum cannibalism).<ref>{{cite book |last=Chagnon |first=Napoleon A. |authorlink=Napoleon Chagnon |editor=George and Louise Spindler |title=Yanomam<U+00F6> |origyear=1968 |edition=5th edition |date=1996-11-15 |publisher=Wadsworth Publishing |location=Fort Worth, Texas |isbn=0-15-505327-2}}</ref>

== Reaction ==
''Cannibal Holocaust'' was released on [[February 7]], 1980, in the Italian city of [[Milan]]. Though the courts and censorship board were outraged and later confiscated the film, the initial audience reaction was positive.<ref name="Interview 2">{{cite interview |last=Deodato |first=Ruggero |subjectlink=Ruggero Deodato |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]] | cointerviewers=[[Bob Murawski]] |title=Cult-Con 2000 |city=Tarrytown, New York |date=2000-11-12 |program=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Commentary}}</ref> After seeing the film, director [[Sergio Leone]] wrote a letter to Deodato, which stated, "Dear Ruggero, what a movie! The second part is a masterpiece of cinematographic realism, but everything seems so real that I think you will get in trouble with all the world" (which was ultimately the case).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fringeunderground.com/snuff.html | title=Final Cuts: The History of Snuff Films |author=Smith, Geof | publisher=Fringe Underground | accessdate=2007-02-15}}</ref> In the ten days before it was seized, the film had grossed approximately $2 million.<ref name="In the Jungle">{{cite video | people = Deodato, Ruggero (interviewee) | year = 2003 | title = In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | accessdate = 2007-01-13 | medium = Documentary | location = Italy | publisher = Alan Young Pictures}}</ref>

=== Critical response ===
Critics remain split on their stances of ''Cannibal Holocaust''. Supporters of the films cite it as real and well made social commentary on the modern world. Mike Bracken called it one of the greatest [[horror movie|horror movies]] ever filmed, and also stated, "Viewers looking for a film that's powerful, visceral, and disturbing have a new title to add to their must-see list."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flipsidemovies.com/cannibalholocaust.html | title=Cannibal Holocaust | author=Bracken, Mike | publisher=Flipside Movie Emporium | accessdate=2007-02-15}}</ref> Sean Axmaker praised the structure and set up of the film, saying, "It's a weird movie with an awkward narrative, which Deodato makes all the more effective with his grimy sheen of documentary realism, while Riz Ortolani's unsettlingly lovely, elegiac score provides a weird undercurrent."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staticmultimedia.com/content/film/features/feature_1134529705 |title=Digital Delirium | author=Axmaker, Sean |publisher=Super Unleaded Design, Inc. |accessdate=2007-02-15}}</ref> Jason Buchanan of [[All Movie Guide]] said, "...while it's hard to defend the director for some of the truly repugnant images with which he has chosen to convey his message, there is indeed an underlying point to the film, if one is able to look beyond the sometimes unwatchable images that assault the viewer."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:132995~T1 | title=Cannibal Holocaust > Review | author=Buchanan, Jason |publisher=All Movie Guide | accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref>

Detractors, however, counter with the genuine animal slayings, questionable acting, and hypocrisy that the film presents. Nick Schager criticized the brutality of the film, saying, "As clearly elucidated by its shocking gruesomeness <U+2013> as well as its unabashedly racist portrait of indigenous folks it purports to sympathize with <U+2013> the actual savages involved with ''Cannibal Holocaust'' are the ones behind the camera."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nickschager.com/nsfp/2005/08/cannibal_holoca.html | title=The Nick Schager Film Project: Cannibal Holocaust | author=Schager, Nick |publisher=Nick Schager Film Project |accessdate=2007-02-15}}</ref> Robert Firsching of All Movie Guide made similar criticisms of the film's content and claimed that the "...pie-faced attempts at socially conscious moralizing make it rather distasteful morally as well. The fact that the film's sole spokesperson for the anti-exploitation perspective is played by porno star Richard Bolla should give an indication of where its sympathies lie."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:132995 |title=Cannibal Holocaust > Overview |author=Firsching, Robert |publisher=[[All Movie Guide]] |accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref> [[Slant Magazine|Slant Magazine's]] Eric Henderson said it is "...artful enough to demand serious critical consideration, yet foul enough to christen you a pervert for even bothering."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/film_review.asp?ID=1848 |title=Film Review:Cannibal Holocaust |author=Henderson, Eric |publisher=Slant Magazine |accessdate=2007-02-15}}</ref>

Since its original release, ''Cannibal Holocaust'' has been the target of censorship by moral and animal activists. Other than graphic gore, the film contains extreme sexual violence in three rape scenes and genuine [[cruelty to animals]], issues which find ''Cannibal Holocaust'' in the midst of controversy even to this day; in 2006, [[Entertainment Weekly]] named ''Cannibal Holocaust'' as the 20th most controversial film of all-time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/commentary/0,6115,1202623_1%7C%7C233612%7C1_0_,00.html | title=The 25 Most Controversial Films of All-Time | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | accessdate=2006-09-14}}</ref> It has also been claimed that ''Cannibal Holocaust'' is banned in over 50 countries,<ref>{{cite DVD-notes |title=Cannibal Holocaust 25th Anniversary Edition |titleyear=1980 |director=[[Ruggero Deodato]] |format=back cover |publisher=[[VIPCO (Video Instant Picture Company)]] |location=[[UK]] |publisherid=VIP666SE |year=2004}}</ref> though this has never been verified.

=== Original Italian controversy ===
The original controversy surrounding the film's release was the belief that ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was an actual [[snuff film]], or that the actors were [[murder|murdered]] in order to film their deaths for the movie. The film was confiscated ten days after premiering in Milan and Deodato was arrested. The courts believed not only that the four actors portraying the missing film crew were killed for the camera, but that the actress in the iconic impalement scene was actually skewered in such a manner. To make matters worse for Deodato, the actors had signed contracts with him and the producers ensuring that they would not appear in any type of media, motion pictures, [[advertising|commercials]], etc., for one year after the film's release, as to promote the idea that the film was truly the recovered footage of missing documentarians. Thus, when Deodato claimed that he had not killed the group, he was unable to produce them for the [[hearing (law)|hearings]].<ref name="In the Jungle">{{cite video | people = Ruggero Deodato (interviewee) | year = 2003 | title = In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | accessdate = 2007-01-13 | medium = Documentary | location = Italy | publisher = Alan Young Pictures}}</ref><ref name="Interview 2">{{cite interview |last=Deodato |first=Ruggero |subjectlink=Ruggero Deodato |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]] | cointerviewers=[[Bob Murawski]] |title=Cult-Con 2000 |city=Tarrytown, New York |date=2000-11-12 |program=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Extras}}</ref>

Eventually, Deodato was able to prove that the violence was staged. He contacted Luca Barbareschi and told him to gather the other three actors. After declaring the contracts that the actors had signed with him void in order to avoid life in prison, Deodato brought the foursome onto the set of an Italian television show, which satisfied the courts. He still faced the challenge, however, of proving that the impalement scene was merely [[special effect]]s. In court, he explained how the effect was achieved: a bicycle seat was attached to the end of an iron pole, on which the actress sat. She then took a short length of [[balsa]] wood and held it in her mouth and looked skyward, thus making it look like she had been impaled. When demonstrated, however, there was no one who was able to stay as motionless as the actress in the movie. Since she was merely a local girl in Colombia, she was unable to be located. Though the suspicion remained, the courts dropped all murder charges against Deodato.<ref name="In the Jungle">{{cite video | people = Ruggero Deodato (interviewee) | year = 2003 | title = In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | accessdate = 2007-01-13 | medium = Documentary | location = Italy | publisher = Alan Young Pictures}}</ref><ref name="Interview 2">{{cite interview |last=Deodato |first=Ruggero |subjectlink=Ruggero Deodato |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]] | cointerviewers=[[Bob Murawski]] |title=Cult-Con 2000 |city=Tarrytown, New York |date=2000-11-12 |program=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Extras}}</ref>

Despite Deodato being exonerated for murder, the courts still wished to ban the film because of its extreme nature. The decision was made to ban ''Cannibal Holocaust'' because of the genuine animal slayings, citing an obscure law that was originally created to protect [[guinea pig|guinea pigs]]. Because of this, Deodato, the producers, screenwriter, and the [[United Artists]] representative each received a four month suspended sentence after being convicted of obscenity and violence.<ref>{{cite news | title='Cannibal' Keeps X|work=Variety Magazine |publisher= Reed Elsevier Inc. |accessdate=2007-01-28 }}</ref> Deodato had to spend three additional years fighting in the courts to get his film unbanned. Finally, in 1984, the courts ruled in favor of Deodato, and ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was granted a rating certificate of VM18 for the uncut print.<ref name="In the Jungle">{{cite video | people = Ruggero Deodato (interviewee) | year = 2003 | title = In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | accessdate = 2007-01-13 | medium = Documentary | location = Italy | publisher = Alan Young Pictures}}</ref><ref name="Interview 2">{{cite interview |last=Deodato |first=Ruggero |subjectlink=Ruggero Deodato |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]] | cointerviewers=[[Bob Murawski]] |title=Cult-Con 2000 |city=Tarrytown, New York |date=2000-11-12 |program=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Extras}}</ref>

=== International censorship ===
Despite success in Italy, censorship issues would still plague ''Cannibal Holocaust'' in countries around the world. In 1981, ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was released straight to video in the UK, thus circumventing the possible banning of the film by the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC). Two years later, in 1983, the list of [[video nasty|video nasties]] was compiled, which banned films with video releases that were not brought before the BBFC for certification; ''Cannibal Holocaust'' made its way onto the list. It would also be banned in [[Australia]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], and several other countries in 1984,<ref name="Refused">{{cite web | url=http://www.refused-classification.com/Films_C.htm#cannibalholocaust | title=Films C | publisher=Refused-Classification.com | accessdate=2007-01-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078935/ | title=Cannibal Holocaust (1980) | publisher=IMDb | accessdate=2007-01-13}}</ref> although most of these countries have since lifted the ban. In 2001, the BBFC passed ''Cannibal Holocaust'' with an 18 certificate after extensive cuts to remove all animal cruelty and erotised sexual violence, thus putting an end to the 18 year ban<ref name="BBFC">{{cite web | url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/website/Classified.nsf/0/743096A8C9525D8B80256A920036AE7B?OpenDocument | title=Cannibal Holocaust rated 18 by the BBFC | publisher=British Board of Film Classification | accessdate=2006-09-11}}</ref> (if unedited, however, ''Cannibal Holocaust'' is still banned in the UK). Australia would also pass ''Cannibal Holocaust'' with an R18+ rating in 2005 for the uncut print. In 2006, however, the film was banned in its entirety by the [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (New Zealand)|Office of Film and Literature Classification]] in [[New Zealand]]. Though a cut version had been passed with an 18 certificate earlier, both it and the uncut versions were brought before the censorship board and banned in July.<ref name="Refused">{{cite web | url=http://www.refused-classification.com/Films_C.htm#cannibalholocaust | title=Films C | publisher=Refused-Classification.com | accessdate=2007-01-15}}</ref>

=== Animal cruelty ===
Much of the censorship issues with ''Cannibal Holocaust'' involve the on screen killings of animals, which remains a major issue today. A total of six animals are killed in the film:

*A large, screaming [[coatimundi]] (mistaken as a [[muskrat]] in the film) is stabbed multiple times in the neck by an actor.
*A large [[turtle]] (about three feet long) is captured in the water and dragged to shore, where it is then [[decapitation|decapitated]] and its limbs and shell removed. The actors proceed to cook and eat the turtle. 
*A large [[spider]] is killed with a [[machete]].
*A [[snake]] is killed with a machete.
*A [[Common Squirrel Monkey|squirrel monkey]] is captured by a native actor portraying a tribesman, who cuts the monkey's face off with a machete while it is struggling and then eats the brains.
*A [[pig]] is kicked and shot with a rifle.

Many condemn this as animal cruelty for the purpose of mere [[sensationalism]] and only to attract controversy; it has also been called "animal [[torture]]." Deodato himself has condemned his past actions,<ref name="Interview 2">{{cite interview |last=Deodato |first=Ruggero |subjectlink=Ruggero Deodato |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]] | cointerviewers=[[Bob Murawski]] |title=Cult-Con 2000 |city=Tarrytown, New York |date=2000-11-12 |program=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Extras}}</ref> saying "it was stupid to introduce animals."<ref name="Fango">{{cite web | url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/4101 | title=Pointless Cannibal Holocaust Sequel in the Works | publisher=Fangoria | accessdate=2007-01-13}}</ref>

== Interpretations ==
Cannibal Holocaust is seen by some as social commentary on various aspects of modern civilization,<ref name="David Carter">{{cite web | url=http://www.savagecinema.com/cannibalholocaust.html | title=Savage Cinema | author=David Carter | publisher=Savage Cinema | accessdate=2006-09-06}}</ref><ref name="Paly">{{cite web | url=http://voice.paly.net/view_story.php?id=4965 | title=A savage allegory | author=Sheldon, Sam | publisher=The Paly Voice | accessdate=2007-01-23}}</ref> with similar [[satire]] elements seen in other films by Deodato, such as ''Last Cannibal World'' and ''Cut and Run''. Despite these interpretations, Deodato has stated in interviews that he had no intentions in ''Cannibal Holocaust'' but to make a film about cannibals.<ref name="Troma">{{cite web | url=http://www.troma.com/lk/eatenalive_review/ | title=Troma Entertainment | author=[[Lloyd Kaufman|Kaufman, Lloyd]] | publisher=Troma Entertainment | accessdate=2006-09-06}}</ref> Also, actor Luca Barbareschi believes that Deodato has no intentions but to "put on a show."<ref name="Luca">{{cite video | people = Barbareschi, Luca (interviewee) | year = 2003 | title = In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | accessdate = 2007-01-28 | medium = Documentary | location = Italy | publisher = Alan Young Pictures}}</ref> Robert Kerman contradicts these assertions, however, stating that Deodato told him of political concerns involving the media in the making of this film.<ref name="Exposed">{{cite interview |last=Kerman |first=Robert |subjectlink=Robert Kerman |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]] |cointerviewers=[[Bob Murawski]] |title=Robert Kerman Exposed |city=Tarrytown, New York |date=2000-11-15 |program=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Extras}}</ref>

===Modern society and sensationalism===
A common interpretation of ''Cannibal Holocaust'' is that the film was made to critique modern society, comparing "civilized" Western society to that of the cannibals'. David Carter of Savage cinema said, "''Cannibal Holocaust'' is not merely focused on the societal taboo of [[cannibalism|flesh eating]]. The greater theme of the film is the difference between the civilized and the uncivilized. Though the graphic violence can be hard for most to stomach, the most disturbing aspect of the film is what Deodato is saying about modern society. The film asks the questions: 'What is it to be 'civilized'?' and 'Is it a good thing?'"<ref name="David Carter">{{cite web | url=http://www.savagecinema.com/cannibalholocaust.html | title=Savage Cinema | author=David Carter | publisher=Savage Cinema | accessdate=2006-09-06}}</ref> Sam Sheldon and Nick Nordlinger of The Paly Voice also add, "...the film succeeds in depicting modern 'civilized' society to be as inherently savage and brutal as undeveloped tribal cultures."<ref name="Paly">{{cite web | url=http://voice.paly.net/view_story.php?id=4965 | title=A savage allegory | author=Sam Sheldon | publisher=The Paly Voice | accessdate=2007-01-23}}</ref> This is all summarized at the end of the film with Harold Monroe's narrative commentary, "I wonder who the real cannibals are."

More specifically, Deodato came up with the idea for the film after witnessing his son watching news programs concerning the terrorism of the [[Red Brigades]].<ref name="Exposed">{{cite interview |last=Kerman |first=Robert |subjectlink=Robert Kerman |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]] |cointerviewers=[[Bob Murawski]] |title=Robert Kerman Exposed |city=Tarrytown, New York |date=2000-11-15 |program=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Extras}}</ref> Deodato noticed that the media would focus on depicting the violent acts with disregard to [[Journalism ethics and standards|journalistic integrity]], so he attempted to expose this by setting the example used in the film. Carter supports this by saying, "[The lack of journalistic integrity] is shown through the interaction between Professor Monroe and the news agency that had backed the documentary crew. They continually push Monroe to finish editing the footage because blood and guts equal ratings."<ref name="David Carter">{{cite web | url=http://www.savagecinema.com/cannibalholocaust.html | title=Savage Cinema | author=David Carter | publisher=Savage Cinema | accessdate=2006-09-06}}</ref> This form of exploitatious journalism cannot only still be seen today, but also in reality television as well.<ref name="Troma">{{cite web | url=http://www.troma.com/lk/eatenalive_review/ | title=Troma Entertainment | author=[[Lloyd Kaufman|Kaufman, Lloyd]] | publisher=Troma Entertainment | accessdate=2006-09-06}}</ref> Utilizing the "''[[cin<U+00E9>ma v<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>]]''" he learnt from his mentor, [[Roberto Rossellini]], Deodato created ''Cannibal Holocaust'' incorporating a hyperrealistic filming method.

== Film influence ==
Deodato drew influence from the works of [[Gualtiero Jacopetti]] and Franco Prosperi, documentary film makers whom Deodato was a fan of.<ref name="Ortolani">{{cite video | people = [[Riz Ortolani|Ortolani, Riz]] (interviewee) | year = 2003 | title = In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | accessdate = 2007-01-28 | medium = Documentary | location = Italy | publisher = Alan Young Pictures}}</ref> Prosperi and Jacopetti produced several [[Mondo film|Mondo films]], which are documentaries similar to the one made in ''Cannibal Holocaust''. These documentaries focused on sensationalistic and graphic content from around the world, including bizarre local customs, death, and general cruelty. Deodato followed suit in ways of similar content, such as graphic violence and animal slayings. Though fictional, Deodato would create a similar expos<U+00E9> of worldly violence, such as Prosperi's and Jacopetti's ''[[Mondo Cane]]''.<ref name="Ortolani">{{cite video | people = [[Riz Ortolani|Ortolani, Riz]] (interviewee) | year = 2003 | title = In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | accessdate = 2007-01-28 | medium = Documentary | location = Italy | publisher = Alan Young Pictures}}</ref>

''Cannibal Holocaust'' was innovative in its plot structure, specifically with the concept of the "found footage" being brought back to civilization and later viewed to determine the fate of the crew that shot it. Later films, such as ''[[The Last Broadcast (film)|The Last Broadcast]]'' and ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', would use similar plot structures. Each film uses the idea of a lost film team making a documentary in the wilderness, and their footage returned. Also, like ''Cannibal Holocaust'', advertisements for ''The Blair Witch Project'' promoted the idea that the footage is genuine.<ref>{{cite web | last = Klein | first =Joshua| title = Interview - The Blair Witch Project | work = avclub.com | date = [[1999-07-22]]| url = http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22980| accessdate = 2007-01-16 }}</ref> Deodato has acknowledged the similarities between his film and ''The Blair Witch Project'', and though he holds no malice against the producers, he is frustrated at the publicity that ''The Blair Witch Project'' received for being an original production.<ref name="Interview 2">{{cite interview |last=Deodato |first=Ruggero |subjectlink=Ruggero Deodato |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]] | cointerviewers=[[Bob Murawski]] |title=Cult-Con 2000 |city=Tarrytown, New York |date=2000-11-12 |program=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Extras}}</ref> The producers of ''The Last Broadcast'' have denied that ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was a major influence.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Weiler | first=Lance | interviewer=Guido Henkel |title=The Facts About The Last Broadcast |date=1999-12-09}}</ref>

''Cannibal Holocaust'' bears similarities to other [[cannibal film|cannibal films]] made during the same time period, notably ''[[Cannibal Ferox]]''. Though ''Cannibal Ferox'' director [[Umberto Lenzi]] has not acknowledged any influence, star [[Giovanni Lombardo Radice]] says ''Cannibal Ferox'' was made based on the success of ''Cannibal Holocaust.''<ref>{{cite interview |last=Radice |first=Giovanni Lombardo |subjectlink=Giovanni Lombardo Radice |interviewer=Sage Stallone |cointerviewers=Bob Murawski|program=Cannibal Ferox DVD Commentary}}</ref> ''Cannibal Holocaust'' also spawned numerous and similar unofficial sequels, some with scenes mirrored from the original.

The soundtrack is entirely composed by Italian [[Riz Ortolani]], who was specifically requested by director Ruggero Deodato. The music itself is a variety of styles, from a gentle melody in the ''Main Theme'', to a sad and flowing score in ''Crucified Woman'', and even faster and more upbeat tracks in ''Cameraman's Recreation'', ''Relaxing in the Savannah'', and ''Drinking Coco''. The instrumentals are equally mixed, ranging from full orchestras to electronics and synthesizers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.moviegrooves.com/shop/cannibalholocaustsoundtrack.htm | title=Cannibal Holocaust soundtrack | publisher=Movie Grooves | accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref> The original soundtrack release was in Germany in 1995, on the Lucertola Media label. This was a limited release of 1,000 copies<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.soundtrackcollector.com/catalog/soundtrackdetail.php?movieid=8474 | title=Soundtrack Details: Cannibal Holocaust | publisher=SoundtrackCollector.com | accessdate=2007-01-14}}</ref> and is a highly sought item by fans of the movie. In August 2005, the soundtrack was released again, this time in the United States, on the Coffin Records label.

== Releases and sequels ==
With such extensive controversy, there are many different versions of ''Cannibal Holocaust'' in circulation, some unedited, and others substantially edited. Most "uncut" releases are actually missing around five to ten seconds of film material from the "Last Road to Hell" segment of the film, which includes real documentary execution footage. These few seconds are missing as a result of the original film negatives being damaged during the film-to-DVD transfer. It is estimated that there are only five legitimate uncut releases of ''Cannibal Holocaust'', including the missing footage of the "Last Road to Hell" sequence as a supplement. These releases are:<ref name="DVDCompare">{{cite web | url=http://www.dvdcompare.net/comparisons/film.php?fid=1709 | title=The Home of DVD Comparisons | publisher=The Rewind Network | accessdate=2007-01-15}}</ref>

*The Deluxe Collector's Edition (Australian release by Siren Visual Entertainment)
*The Ultrabit Collector's Edition (Limited Edition out of 4,000 copies. Dutch release by EC Entertainment)

The Australian release is an identical copy of the US release, but is instead called the "Deluxe Collector's Edition". Both releases include the intact version of the "Last Road to Hell" sequence as an extra. The EC entertainment Ultrabit Collector's Edition and the Another World Entertainment release are the only two releases that include the intact sequence within the feature. Another common release is the 25th Anniversary Edition released in the UK by [[VIPCO (Video Instant Picture Company)|Video Instant Picture Company]] (VIPCO), which is heavily cut to comply with BBFC editing and runs at a [[PAL]] format running time of 86 minutes.<ref name="BBFC">{{cite web | url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/website/Classified.nsf/0/743096A8C9525D8B80256A920036AE7B?OpenDocument | title=CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST rated 18 by the BBFC | publisher=British Board of Film Classification | accessdate=2006-09-11}}</ref>

Though no official sequel has been released, several films have adopted the moniker ''Cannibal Holocaust II'' as to be associated with ''Cannibal Holocaust's'' notoriety. These films were originally released under different titles which were then changed for various releases; none have been directed by or associated with Deodato. The first of said films came in 1986 with Mario Gariazzo's ''Schiave Bianche: Violenza en Amazzonia''. Known in English as ''Amazonia: The Catherine Miles Story'', it has also been released on European DVD as ''Cannibal Holocaust 2: The Catherine Miles Story''. In 1988, Mondo [[film director]] Antonio Climati made his film ''[[Natura Contro]]'', which was released as ''Cannibal Holocaust II'' in [[Thailand]] and the UK. Italian director Bruno Mattei also made two straight-to-video films back to back in 2003, which have been released as ''Cannibal Holocaust'' sequels in [[Japan]].<ref name="DVDcompare">{{cite web | url=http://www.dvdaficionado.com/dvds.html?cat=0&tiq=cannibal+holocaust&rg=AIn | title=DVD Aficionado | publisher=Saudakar Corporation | accessdate=2007-01-14}}</ref>

In 2005, Ruggero Deodato officially announced that he planned to make a sequel to ''Cannibal Holocaust''.<ref name="Fango">{{cite web | url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/4101 | title=Pointless Cannibal Holocaust Sequel in the Works | publisher=Fangoria | accessdate=2007-01-13}}</ref> Though he has written two screenplays, filming has yet to begin. Deodato was later hesitant about directing his new film, thinking that he would make it too violent for American audiences. However, while in Prague filming his cameo appearance in ''[[Hostel: Part II]]'', Deodato received the chance to view the original ''[[Hostel (film)|Hostel]]'' and decided that he would direct afterall, citing Hostel as a similarly violent film that made a mainstream release in America.<ref name="BLOODY2">{{cite web | url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/7578 | title=Ruggero Deodato Talks 'Cannibal Holocaust 2' | publisher=Bloody-Disgusting.com | accessdate=2007-01-14}}</ref> The film is scheduled for release in 2009.
