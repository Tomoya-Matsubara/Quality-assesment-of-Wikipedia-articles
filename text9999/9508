They have held the top two rankings on the ATP Tour from July 2005 until 14 September 2009, when Nadal fell to World No. 3 (Andy Murray became the new No. 2). They are the only pair of men to have ever finished four consecutive calendar years at the top. Federer was ranked number 1 for a record 237 consecutive weeks beginning in February 2004.

Until 14 September 2009, when Juan Martin del Potro beat Nadal in the US Open semi-final on his way to defeating Federer in the final itself, no player had beaten Nadal and Federer in the same Grand Slam. Nadal has not lost a French Open (4) or Australian Open (1) final, while Federer was undefeated in US Open finals until losing to del Potro (5). Both have won Grand Slam events on three different surfaces successively (2008 French Open, 2008 Wimbledon, 2009 Australian Open for Nadal and 2008 US Open, 2009 French Open, 2009 Wimbledon for Federer).

====Federer vs. Roddick====

{{Main|Federer<U+2013>Roddick rivalry}}

Federer and [[Andy Roddick|Roddick]] have a long, though lopsided, rivalry. They have met 21 times during their careers, with Federer leading their overall head-to-head series 19<U+2013>2. Roddick is Federer's most frequent opponent on tour.<ref name="NewYorkTimes-OnWayToMarathon">{{cite web

Roddick has lost four Grand Slam finals, each time to Federer: Wimbledon in 2004, 2005, and 2009, and one US Open in 2006.
On 2 February 2004, Federer supplanted Roddick as World No. 1 to begin his record reign of 237 consecutive weeks at number 1. Federer and Roddick are the only players to have finished each tennis season in the ATP top 10 every year from 2002 to 2009.

===Playing style===
Federer's versatility was epitomised by [[Jimmy Connors]]' statement: "In an era of specialists, you're either a clay court specialist, a grass court specialist, or a hard court specialist...or you're Roger Federer."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsfeelgoodstories.com/2009/02/20/roger-federer-a-class-act-on-and-off-the-court-leads-tennis-revival/|title=Roger Federer, a class act on and off the court, leads tennis revival|author=www.sportsfeelgoodstories.com|date=2009-02-20|accessdate=2010-02-16}}</ref>

Federer is an all-court, all-round player known for his fluid style of play and shot making. Federer mainly plays from the baseline but is also comfortable at the net being one of the best volleyers in the game today. [[David Foster Wallace]] described Federer's exceptional speed, fluidity and brute force of this forehand motion as "a great liquid whip",<ref name="Wallace">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html?ex=1313726400&en=716968175e36505e&ei=5090 |author=David Foster Wallace |title=Federer as Religious Experience |date=2006-08-20 |work=Play Magazine |publisher=''New York Times''|accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> while [[John McEnroe]] has referred to Federer's forehand as "the greatest shot in our sport".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/other/story/6741576?MSNHPHCP&GT1=10035|title=Who's the best athlete in the world right now?|author=Kevin Hench|date=7 May 2007|publisher=Fox Sports|accessdate=2009-03-31}}</ref> Federer plays with a single-handed backhand which gives him great variety. He employs the use of the [[Backspin|slice]], can also fire top-spin winning shots and he also possesses a 'flick' backhand where he can generate pace with his wrist; this is usually used to pass the opponent at the net.<ref name="Wallace" /> His [[Serve (tennis)|serve]] is difficult to read because he tosses the ball in the same spot no matter where he intends to serve it and he turns his back to his opponents during his motion. He is often able to produce big serves on key points during a match. His first serve is typically around 200&nbsp;km/h (125&nbsp;mph),<ref name=AUSServe>{{cite web|url=http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/scores/stats/day19/1701ms.html|title=Match Statistics: Federer vs. Murray|author=Australianopen.com|accessdate=2010-02-16}}</ref><ref name=WIMBYServe>{{cite web|url=http://2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/scores/stats/day21/1701ms.html|title=Match Statistics:Federer vs. Roddick|author=Wimbledon.org|accessdate=2010-02-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon08/columns/story?columnist=ubha_ravi&id=3471097|title=Federer's serve allowing him to manufacture easy points|author=Ubha, Ravi|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2008-07-02|accessdate=2010-02-16}}</ref> however, he is capable of serving at 220&nbsp;km/h (137&nbsp;mph)<ref name=AUSServe/><ref name=WIMBYServe/> Federer also utilizes a well-disguised drop shot off of both wings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/tennis/article6540564.ece|author=[[Jamie Murray]]|title=Drop shot can be Andy Murray's deadly weapon on grass|publisher=Timesonline.com|date=2009-06-22|accessdate=2010-02-16}}</ref>
