The [[1948 Major League Baseball season]] was predicted to be a close race between the Yankees and Red Sox. In a United Press poll conducted just before the season started, the majority of sportswriters chose the Yankees, who had won [[1947 World Series|last year's World Series]], to face the Braves or [[St. Louis Cardinals]] that year, while others chose the Red Sox; only one sportswriter chose the Indians to reach the World Series.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1UIVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EQgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1486,1112928|title=Cards, Yanks Tabbed By Sports Writers|work=[[Eugene Register-Guard]]|date=April 19, 1948|page=10}}</ref> Most of the American League managers had the Yankees finishing first, followed by the Red Sox, Indians, and [[Detroit Tigers]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Predictions Are In Favor Of Yanks And Cards|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wKUoAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YAYGAAAAIBAJ&pg=3034,2039947|work=[[The Owosso Argus-Press]]|date=April 19, 1948|page=9}}</ref> Tension and confidence was evident between the teams, as two months into the season, after defeating the Red Sox 7&ndash;0, Yankees manager [[Bucky Harris]] declared that the Yankees would win the pennant, though they were currently at second place at the time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tT8xAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xzwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6924,3154482|title=Yankees Crush Red Sox 7-0, Prompts Manager Harris to Claim Pennant|first=Joe|last=Reichler|work=[[Ludington Daily News]]|date=May 30, 1948|page=6}}</ref>

The pennant race continued between the three teams throughout the entire season. On September 25, after playing 147 games, with 7 games left to play, all three teams had a record of 91&ndash;56.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JcALAAAAIBAJ&sjid=k1UDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2098,483828|title=Red Sox, Indians, Yanks Deadlocked in American|first=Ralph|last=Roden|work=[[Evening Independent]]|date=September 25, 1948|page=7}}</ref> After each team played four more games, the Indians were up two games, meaning the Yankees and Red Sox had to win their games on September 30 to stay in the pennant race.

The Indians lost their first game 5&ndash;3 against the Tigers on October 1, giving them a one game lead with two games left to play. As a result, speculation arose about the possibility of a three-way tie.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=K8ALAAAAIBAJ&sjid=k1UDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4224,1666046|title=American League Race May End in Triple Tie|work=Evening Independent|date=October 2, 1948|page=7}}</ref>
On October 2, Cleveland beat Detroit to clinch at least a tie, and Boston beat New York 5&ndash;1, ending the Yankees' pennant run and bringing the race down to two teams.<ref>{{cite news|title=BOMBERS BOW, 5-1; Red Sox End Yanks' Flag Chances When Kramer Pitches a 5-Hitter|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 3, 1948|first=John|last=Drebinger|page=S1}}</ref> On the last day of the season, October 3, Boston won their game and Cleveland lost, giving them identical 96&ndash;58 records and forcing a tiebreaker the following day at Boston.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1AgNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WmoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4554,166717|title=Redsox, Tribe Finish Tied for Lead|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=October 4, 1948|page=18}}</ref> The Indians chose rookie [[Gene Bearden]] to start against Boston in the tie-breaker, despite only having one day of rest, as he had beaten the Red Sox twice that season, and the Red Sox chose [[Denny Galehouse]], passing on [[Mel Parnell]] who had beaten the Indians on three separate occasions that season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IT4bAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OE0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6123,1531260|title=Galehouse and Bearden NAmed Playoff Pitchers|work=[[The Pittsburgh Press]]|date=October 4, 1948|page=21}}</ref>

Galehouse started off the game by quickly getting outs from [[Dale Mitchell (baseball)|Dale Mitchell]] and [[Allie Clark]]. [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|American League MVP]] [[Lou Boudreau]] then hit a solo [[home run]] off Galehouse to make the score 1&ndash;0.<ref name=retrosheet>{{cite web|url=http://retrosheet.org/BOS19481004|title=Game of Monday, 10/4/1948 -- Cleveland at Boston (D)

Both pitchers then got three quick outs in the third inning.<ref name=retrosheet/>

In the fourth inning, the Indians opened up the game. Boudreau and [[Joe Gordon]] hit back-to-back singles, which brought Keltner to the plate. The Red Sox expected a bunt, but instead the third baseman hit his 31st home run of the season to put the Indians ahead, 4&ndash;1.<ref name=bearden>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_i8aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-CQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3922,3384968|title=Bearden, Boudreau, Keltner Share Honors as Indians Win|work=The Milwaukee Journal|date=October 5, 1948|page=8}}</ref> Galehouse was then replaced with [[Ellis Kinder]], who was met with a double by [[Larry Doby]]. Kinder responded by getting the next three batters out, which brought the score to 5&ndash;1 as Doby also scored.<ref name=retrosheet/> After Bearden got three Red Sox out, the Indians started the fifth inning with the top of their lineup. Mitchell and [[Eddie Robinson (baseball)|Eddie Robinson]], who came in for Clark, were out. Boudreau then stepped up to the plate and hit his second home run of the night to make the score 6&ndash;2.<ref name=retrosheet/>

The rest of the fifth inning saw no more hits, and after a Keltner double, three Indians were out in the top of the sixth inning. The Red Sox began to fight back in the bottom of the sixth inning. After getting Pesky out, [[Ted Williams]] reached first base on an error by Gordon. Stephens struck out, and with two outs in the inning, [[Bobby Doerr]] hit his 27th home run of the season to make the score 6&ndash;3.<ref name=bearden/> No runs were scored in the seventh inning, though Bearden and Mitchell both reached base. The Indians were able to score another run in the eighth inning after [[Jim Hegan]] was intentionally [[base on balls|walked]]. Bearden then hit a fly ball to Williams, who dropped it, allowing Hegan to score and making it 7&ndash;3 in the Indians' favor.<ref name=bearden/> The Indians were able to score one more run in the ninth when Robinson scored after Keltner grounded into a bases-loaded [[double play]]. Bearden got the final three Red Sox out in the bottom of the ninth, finishing the game with an 8&ndash;3 Indians victory and giving Bearden a [[complete game]].<ref name=retrosheet/>

==Aftermath==
With the victory, the Indians received their first playoff berth since the [[1920 World Series]]. Indians' Manager Lou Boudreau dedicated the victory to pitcher [[Don Black (baseball)|Don Black]], who suffered a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] the previous month.<ref name=black>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_i8aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-CQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3922,3384968|title=Manager Boudreau Proposes A Toast: 'To Don Black'|work=The Milwaukee Journal|date=October 5, 1948|page=8}}</ref> The Indians went on to face the Boston Braves in the [[1948 World Series]], winning it four games to two. The Red Sox fans experienced disappointment when Boston mayor James M. Curley ordered the fire department sirens sounded when Boston won the pennant. The sirens did sound, but it was instead for a fire in the Boston navy yard.<ref name=black/> 

The Red Sox's defeat disappointed Boston fans, who had been rooting the entire season for an All-Boston World Series. Prior to the October 4 game, the oddsmakers gave the Red Sox the advantage, meaning that an all-Boston World Series was likely.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LMALAAAAIBAJ&sjid=k1UDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3361,1912831|title=Sox Favorites To Make It All-Boston Series|first=Jack|last=Hand|work=Evening Independent|page=12|date=October 4, 1948}}</ref> The Red Sox did not make another playoff appearance until 1967, when the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] defeated them in the [[1967 World Series]].

The game counted as a regular season game in [[baseball statistics]]. As a result, Dom DiMaggio and Vern Stephens led the league with 155 games played, which could not have been equaled by any team other than the Red Sox or Indians.<ref name=br>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1948-batting-leaders.shtml|title=1948 American League Batting Leaders|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=June 13, 2010}}</ref> DiMaggio's four [[at-bat]]s in the game also gave him the league lead with 648, four ahead of [[Bob Dillinger]] of the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]].<ref name=br/> Dale Mitchell's one [[single (baseball)|single]] also gave him the league lead in that statistics, beating out Dillinger by one.<ref name=br/> Gene Bearden's nine inning, one [[earned run]] performance brought his [[earned run average]] (ERA) down to 2.43, which led the American League.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1948-pitching-leaders.shtml|title=1948 American League Pitching Leaders|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=June 13, 2010}}</ref> Boudreau finished the season with a .355 [[batting average]], 116 [[run (baseball)|runs]], 18 home runs, and 106 [[runs batted in]], and won the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award]] at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/boudrlo01.shtml|title=Lou Boudreau Statistics and History|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=June 13, 2010}}</ref>
