==History==
Qigexing was part of the ancient Buddhist Kingdom of [[Karasahr]] (also spelled "Karashara") that is first mentioned in Chinese sources from the [[Han Dynasty]] as the Kingdom of Yanqi ({{zh|c=<U+7109><U+8006>|p=Yanqi}}, the Chinese name for Karasahr). In 94 CE, Qigexing was conquered by the Han Dynasty in its reconquest of the [[Tarim Basin]]. The Buddhist monk [[Faxian]] visited the area of Yanqi around 400 CE and mentions the presence of about 4,000 monks who were practicing [[Hinayana]] Buddhism.<ref name=yaldiz1987> Marianne Yald<U+0131>z: Arch<U+00E4>ologie und Kunstgeschichte Chinesisch-Zentralasiens (Xinjiang), Leiden, 1987</ref> The monk [[Xuanzang]], who lived in the 7th century CE, reports the existence of 10 Buddhist monasteries with 2,000 monks who belonged to the [[Sarvastivada]] school of Buddhism in the area around Yanqi.<ref name=yaldiz1987/>  In 719 CE, the [[Tang Dynasty]] established one of the [[Four Garrisons of Anxi]] in Yanqi, the other garrisons were in [[Kucha]], [[Kashgar]], and [[Hotan]]. [[Aurel Stein]] hypothesized that the Buddhist temples of Qigexing were burned during an [[iconoclasm]] after Islam became the state religion of the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]].<ref name=stein1921/> Archeological finds in Qigexing include the ruins of larger temple compounds (with more than 100 buildings in total<ref name=yaldiz1987/>) as well as twelf cave temples<ref name=gruenwedel1912/><ref name=yaldiz1987/>. The remains of some wall paintings and in particular sculptures have been discovered at the site. Sculptures have been found as individual figures as well as in friezes. The style of the artworks mixes indo-iranian elments with Chinese styles.<ref name=yaldiz1987/> The depiction of human heads at the site has a characteristic style with faces that are bulged out like balloons.<ref name=yaldiz1987/> The Qigexing site is also an important source for manuscripts written in the [[Tocharian languages|East Tocharian language]], also known as Tocharian A or Agnean after Agni an ancient name for Yanqi. Of the 1150 leaves and fragments in East Tocharian that were included in a 2007 survey, 383 came from a single scriptorum in Qigexing.<ref name=Hansen2012>[http://books.google.com/books?id=nPg4UVV_JTYC&pg=PT87 Valerie Hansen, The Silk Road: A New History, Oxford University Press, Jul 17, 2012]</ref>
