===Coaching career===

Daniel began his coaching career as an offensive line coach at [[Enterprise High School (Alabama)|Enterprise High School]] from 1974<U+2013>1980 after graduating from Alabama State. He enjoyed a high level of success at the high school level, as during this five year time span eleven of his offensive linemen earned college scholarships. <ref name=SteelersBio>{{cite web|title=James Daniel Bio|url=http://www.steelers.com/team/coaches/james-daniel/59a96a72-2fc7-4596-9eaf-3410f19227ca|work=Steelers.com|publisher=NFL.com|accessdate=24 May 2011}}</ref> 

He moved to [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]] in 1981 to serve as the offensive line coach on head coach [[Pat Dye]]'s staff from 1981 to 1992. During his 12 year [[Auburn_Tigers_football#Pat_Dye_era_.281981-1992.29|tenure]], the Tigers appeared in nine consecutive bowl games, four linemen were selected for [[All-American]] honours and several selected All-[[Southeastern Conference|SEC]].  <ref name=SteelersBio />

Daniel's first professional level coaching experience came as a part of the NFL's Minority Fellowship program, with the [[New Orleans Saints]] in 1988 and with the [[Denver Broncos]] in 1992 under head coach [[Dan Reeves]].  <ref>http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d80190ab4/article/nfl-minority-coaching-fellowship-attracts-83-participants NFL.com news</ref> He made his professional-level debut with the [[New York Giants]], serving as tight end coach from 1993 to 1996. He moved to the [[Atlanta Falcons]] in 1997, serving in the same capacity from 1997 to 2003.  Daniel was instrumental in the development of tight end Alge Crumpler, who led the Falcons in receptions in 2002 and 2003 and has earned four Pro Bowl selections as well as two All-Pro honours.  Daniel also served as the offensive line coach in 2000.<ref name=SteelersBio />  

Daniel joined the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2004, replacing [[Ken Whisenhunt]] as tight ends coach after Whisenhunt was promoted to offensive coordinator. He has been instrumental in the development of tight end Heath Miller, guiding Miller to become an all-around player and a solid postseason contributor. Under Daniel's tutelage, Miller has earned a Pro Bowl selection, and team records for single-season receptions as well as postseason receptions, touchdowns, and yards at the tight end position.<ref name=SteelersBio />
