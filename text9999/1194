==Track Notes==
The EP includes an early version of "Get It Right" of which a later version was released on their second [[studio album]] ''[[Ignition (The Offspring album)|Ignition]]''. The title track "Baghdad" was a re-recording of the song "Tehran" which appeared on the Offspring's debut [[The Offspring (album)|self-titled]] album in 1989. It switches the words "Tehran" (the capital of [[Iran]]) for "Baghdad" (the capital of [[Iraq]]). The EP also includes a cover version of "Hey Joe" by Billy Roberts (a different version from what was later released on "[[Gone Away]]") and a previous unreleased instrumental track "The Blurb", which would not appear on any future recordings, but served as the basis for an early version of "Genocide", as well as "Change the World".
