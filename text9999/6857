The school is divided into a middle school, serving approximately 150 students in grades six to eight, and an upper school, serving approximately 500 students in grades nine and above, including some postgraduates.  Approximately one-third of students in the upper school participate in the school's five- and seven-day [[boarding school|boarding]] programs. Currently there are approximately 80 international students enrolled from 10 different nations.

Worcester Academy is a member of the [[New England Preparatory School Athletic Council]].

Its motto is the Greek phrase "<U+0388><U+03C6><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03CD> <U+03C4><U+03CE><U+03BD> <U+039A><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03CE><U+03BD>," which translates to "Achieve the Honorable."

==History==

Founded in [[1834]] as the Worcester County Manual Labor High School, it did not change its name until [[1847]].  The school moved to its current location on Union Hill in Worcester in [[1869]]. Worcester Academy was all-male from its founding until [[1856]], and again from [[1890]] to [[1974]].  It has been coeducational since.

==Campus==

Worcester Academy's campus is currently spread over four main parcels:  the main campus, which contains approximately twelve acres; Francis A. Gaskill Field, a twelve-acre parcel two blocks from the main campus; and the [[New Balance]] Fields on Stafford Street, comprising about thirty acres. Worcester Academy also recently relocated some of its offices and alumni facilities to a renovated [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] home two blocks from the main campus. In [[2006]], Worcester Academy signed a purchase and sale agreement to purchase an additional thirteen acres between Gaskill Field and the main campus, with the intent of creating a new indoor athletic complex.

On the main campus, several beautiful brick buildings are listed on the national historic register, including Chester W. Kingsley Laboratories, Joseph H. Walker Hall, Reverend Robert J. Adams Hall, and William H. Dexter Hall.  The headmaster lives in the Daniel W. Abercrombie House, named for the principal of Worcester Academy from 1882 to 1918.

One of the most famous and remarkable architectural buildings on the campus is the Lewis J. Warner Memorial Theater, a gift from [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers Studio]] President [[Harry Warner]].  He donated the building in memory of his son Lewis Warner '28, who died shortly after graduating from the academy.  The Academy's formal student assemblies are held in Warner Theater to this day, though the theater is no longer able to seat the entire middle and upper school student bodies at once.

==Athletics==

Worcester is a member of the [[New England Preparatory School Athletic Council]].  Its main athletic rivals include [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], [[Phillips Academy|Phillips Academy Andover]], [[Deerfield Academy]], [[Cushing Academy]], [[Lawrence Academy]], [[Governor Dummer Academy]], [[Loomis Chaffee]], and [[Milton Academy]].

In [[2005]]-[[2006]] the girls' varsity basketball team had an undefeated season, winning the NEPSAC championship.

==Other==

In [[September]] [[2006]], [[Boston Magazine]] rated Worcester Academy the sixteenth best private school in the Boston Area, and the best in Worcester County.  In an article entitled "The Right Private School for Your Kid," Boston Magazine rated Worcester Academy the best private school in the Boston area for students to exercise their mathematical talents.
