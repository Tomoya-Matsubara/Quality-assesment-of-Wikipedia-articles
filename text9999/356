Operational centers are located in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], and [[Torrance, California]], United States.

Lexus originated from a clandestine [[flagship car|flagship]] sedan project, [[code-name]]d F1, which began in 1983 and culminated in the launch of the original [[Lexus LS]] in 1989. Subsequently, the division added [[sedan (car)|sedan]], [[coup<U+00E9>]], [[convertible]], and [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]] models. In 2005, a [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] version of the [[Lexus RX|RX]] crossover debuted, and additional hybrid models later joined the division's lineup. In 2007, Lexus launched its own [[Lexus#F marque|F marque]] performance division with the debut of the [[Lexus IS F|IS F]] sport sedan, followed by the [[Lexus LFA|LFA]] supercar in 2009.

From the start of production, Lexus vehicles have been produced in Japan, with manufacturing centered in the [[Ch<U+016B>bu region|Ch<U+016B>bu]] and [[Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>]] regions, and in particular at Toyota's [[Tahara plant|Tahara]], [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], Ch<U+016B>bu and [[Miyata, Fukuoka|Miyata]], [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]], Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B> plants. Assembly of the first Lexus built outside the country, the [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]-produced RX 330, began in 2003. Following a corporate reorganization from 2001 to 2005, Lexus also operates its own [[automotive design|design]], [[automotive engineering|engineering]], and manufacturing centers, solely responsible for the division's vehicles.

Since the 2000s, Lexus has increased sales outside its largest market in the United States through an ongoing global expansion. The division inaugurated [[Car dealership|dealership]]s in Japan's [[Japanese domestic market|domestic market]] in 2005, becoming the first Japanese premium car marque to launch in its [[country of origin]].<ref name=cbs/> Further debuts in [[Southeast Asia]], [[Latin America]], [[Europe]], and other  [[export]] regions have since followed. The division's lineup has also been expanded to reflect regional specifications in model and [[powertrain]] configurations.

== History ==

=== 1980s: The F1 project ===
In 1983, Toyota chairman [[Eiji Toyoda]] summoned a secret meeting of company executives, to whom he posed the question, <U+201C>Can we create a luxury vehicle to challenge the world's best?<U+201D><ref name=m43>{{Harvnb|May|2006|p=43}}</ref> This question prompted Toyota to embark on a top-secret project, code-named F1 (<U+201C>Flagship One<U+201D>).<ref>{{Harvnb|May|2006|p=42}}</ref> The F1 project, whose finished product was ultimately the [[Lexus LS|Lexus LS 400]], aimed to develop a flagship sedan that would expand Toyota<U+2019>s product line, giving it a foothold in the premium segment and offering both longtime and new customers an upmarket product.<ref name=pr>{{cite web|url=http://www.autolinedetroit.tv/autoline/watch.php?stream=927|title=How Lexus Was Successful in the U.S. (interview)|year=2006|format=WMV|last=Press|first=Jim|accessdate=2006|publisher=Auto Line Detroit}}</ref> The F1 project followed the success of the [[Toyota Supra]] sports car and the premium [[Toyota Cressida]] models.<ref>White, John.

The largest sedan Toyota built at the time was the limited-production, 1960s-vintage [[Toyota Century]], its domestic, hand built, limousine flagship and sole V8-powered model,<ref name=d6/> followed by the inline-six-engined [[Toyota Crown]] premium sedan.<ref name=d6>{{Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=6<U+2013>7, 63}}</ref><ref name=l16>{{Harvnb|Long|2001|pp=16<U+2013>21}}</ref> The Century was conservatively styled for the Japanese market, and along with the Crown not slated for export.<ref name=l16/> F1 designers targeted their new sedan at international markets and began development on a new V8 engine.<ref name=d6/><ref name=l16/>

The opportunity for Japanese manufacturers to export more expensive models had grown in the 1980s due to [[Voluntary Export Restraints|voluntary export restraints]], negotiated by the Japanese government and U.S. trade representatives, restricting mainstream car sales.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=xix, 28}}</ref> In 1986, [[Honda]] launched its [[Acura]] marque in the U.S., influencing Toyota's plans for a luxury division;<ref name=d109>{{Harvnb|Dawson|2004|p=109}}</ref> the initial Acura model was an export version of the [[Honda Legend]], itself launched in Japan in 1985 as a rival to the Toyota Crown, [[Nissan Cedric]]/[[Nissan Gloria|Gloria]] and [[Mazda Luce]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.zakzak.co.jp/society/domestic/news/20100716/dms1007161623011-n2.htm|title=Honda's premium sedan, "Legend"|language=Japanese|work=[[Sankei Shimbun]]|date=2010-07-16|accessdate=2011-01-31}}</ref> In 1987, [[Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.|Nissan]] unveiled its plans for a premium brand, [[Infiniti]],<ref name=d72>{{Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=72, 88, 116}}</ref> and revised its flagship [[Nissan President]] sedan in standard wheelbase form for export as the [[Infiniti Q45]], which it launched in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gazoo.com/meishakan/meisha/shousai.asp?R_ID=5498&ex_spec=shousai|title=Profile: 1990 Nissan President|language=Japanese|publisher=Gazoo|accessdate=2011-01-31|year=2011}}</ref> In 1988, [[Mazda]] began selling the Luce as the [[Mazda 929]] in North America, and later began plans to develop an upscale marque, to be called [[Mazda#Marques|Amati]], but its plans did not come to fruition.<ref name=d72/>

Toyota researchers visited the U.S. in May 1985 to conduct [[focus group]]s and [[market research]] on luxury consumers.<ref name=d35>{{Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=35, 41}}</ref> During that time, several F1 designers rented a home in [[Laguna Beach, California]] to observe the lifestyles and tastes of [[American upper class]] consumers.<ref name=d35/> Meanwhile, F1 engineering teams conducted prototype testing on locations ranging from the German [[autobahn]] to U.S. roads.<ref name=ed>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/lexus/|title=Edmunds.com Lexus Overview|publisher=[[Edmunds.com]]|accessdate=2011-05-23}}</ref> Toyota<U+2019>s market research concluded that a separate [[brand name|brand]] and sales channel were needed to present its new flagship sedan, and plans were made to develop a new network of dealerships in the U.S. market.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morgan|Liker|2006|p=121}}</ref>

==== Brand development ====
[[File:Lexus Balance ad.jpg|thumb|Lexus made its [[Balance (advertisement)|television debut]] with champagne glasses stacked on the hood of a revving LS 400.|alt=Car front view, halfway lit, with 15 champagne glasses stacked on the hood to form a triangle.]]
In 1986, Toyota<U+2019>s longtime advertising agency [[Saatchi & Saatchi]] formed a specialized unit, Team One, to handle marketing for the new premium brand.<ref name=d109/> Image consulting firm [[Lippincott Mercer|Lippincott & Margulies]] was hired to develop a list of 219 prospective names; Vectre, Verone, Chaparel, Calibre and Alexis were chosen as top candidates.<ref name=m57>{{Harvnb|Mahler|2004|pp=56<U+2013>57}}</ref> While Alexis quickly became the front runner, concerns were raised that the name applied to people more than cars (being associated with the [[Alexis Carrington]] character on the popular 1980s primetime drama [[Dynasty (TV series)|''Dynasty'']]),<ref name=m57/><ref name=d111/> and as a result the first letter was removed and the "i" replaced with a "u" to morph the name to Lexus.<ref name=d111>{{Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=111}}</ref>

The etymology of the Lexus name has been attributed to the combination of the words "luxury" and "elegance,"<ref name=flex>{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/facesinthenews/2005/07/26/toyota-lexus-autos-cx_cn_0726autofacescan02.html|title=Watanabe's Toyota Rolls Out Lexus In Japan|date=2005-07-26|work=[[Forbes]]|last=Noon|first=Chris|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> and another theory claims it is an acronym for "luxury exports to the U.S."<ref name=flex/> According to Team One interviews, the brand name has no specific meaning and simply denotes a luxurious and technological image.<ref name=m57/> Just prior to the release of the first vehicles, database service [[LexisNexis]] obtained a temporary [[injunction]] forbidding the name Lexus from being used as they stated it might cause confusion.<ref name=d130>{{Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=128<U+2013>30}}</ref> The injunction threatened to delay the division's launch and marketing efforts.<ref name=d130/> Upon reflection, a [[U.S. appeals court]] lifted the injunction, deciding that there was little likelihood of confusion between the two products.<ref name=d130/>

The original Lexus slogan, developed after Team One representatives visited Lexus designers in Japan and noted an obsessive attention to detail, became "''The Relentless Pursuit of Perfection.''"<ref>{{Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=113<U+2013>14}}</ref> The Lexus logo was developed by Molly Designs and Hunter Communications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mollydesigns.com/history.html|title=Molly Designs history, Lexus logo design|publisher=Molly Designs|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080611081501/http://www.mollydesigns.com/history.html|archivedate=2008-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://huntercommunications.com/HCmain/company/lexus.html|title=An Enduring Symbol of Excellence|publisher=Hunter Communications|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/2003040715380/http://huntercommunications.com/HCmain/company/lexus.html|archivedate=2003-04-07}}</ref> The final design for the Lexus logo featured a stylized <U+201C>''L''<U+201D> within an oval, and according to Toyota, was rendered using a precise mathematical formula.<ref name=m57/> The first teaser ads featuring the Lexus name and logo, designed by Team One, appeared at the Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York auto shows in 1988.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dawson|2004|p=115}}</ref>

In 1989, after an extended development process involving 60 designers, 24 engineering teams, 1,400 engineers, 2,300 technicians, 220 support workers, around 450 prototypes, and over {{USD|1 billion}} in costs, the F1 project was completed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dawson|2004|p=24}}</ref> The resulting flagship, the Lexus LS 400, had a unique design that shared no major elements with previous Toyota vehicles, with a new 4.0 L [[V8 engine|V8]] [[Four-stroke cycle|gasoline engine]] and [[rear-wheel drive]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=xxi, 69}}</ref><ref name=m31>{{Harvnb|Mahler|2004|p=31}}</ref> The LS 400 debuted in January 1989 at the [[North American International Auto Show]] in Detroit,<ref name=d72/> and officially went on sale the following September at a network of 81 new Lexus dealerships across the U.S.<ref>{{Harvnb|May|2006|p=47}}</ref> The LS 400 was sold along with a smaller sibling, the [[Toyota Vista#V20|Toyota Camry]]-based [[Lexus ES|ES 250]].<ref name=ed/> The launch of Lexus was heralded by a multimillion dollar advertising campaign in both television and print media.<ref name=d118>{{Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=117<U+2013>18}}</ref>

In December 1989, Lexus initiated a voluntary recall of all 8,000 LS 400s sold to date, based upon two customer complaints over defective [[wiring]] and an overheated [[brake light]].<ref name=zen/> In a sweeping 20-day operation which replaced the parts on all affected vehicles, Lexus sent technicians to pick up, repair, and return cars to customers free of charge, and also flew in personnel and rented garage space for owners in remote locations.<ref name=zen/> This response was lauded in media publications and helped establish the marque's early reputation for [[customer service]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060327/SUB/60322012/1003|title=How a recall earned Lexus a top reputation |work=[[Automotive News]]|accessdate=2009-02-19|last=Denove|first=Chris|date=2006-03-27|coauthors=Power, James}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Long|2001|pp=38<U+2013>39}}</ref>
