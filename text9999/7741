[[Image:Palace of Westminster, London - Feb 2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palace of Westminster]], home to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and the [[House of Lords]]]]
This is a '''list of speakers who have addressed both Houses of the United Kingdom Parliament at the same time'''.  [[President of France|French President]] [[Albert Lebrun]] was the first person to address both the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and the [[House of Lords]] in March 1939.  The list excludes the speeches given by the reigning [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Monarch]] at the [[State Opening of Parliament]].<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/occasions/stateopening.cfm | title = State Opening of Parliament | accessdate = 2008-03-27 | work = www.parliament.uk}}</ref>

Only two people besides the reigning British Monarch at the time have addressed both Houses together on more than one occasion.  [[Nelson Mandela]] spoke to Members of the Commons and the Lords in 1993 and in 1996 as [[President of South Africa]].  [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] addressed the Houses as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1984 and again, in 1993, on behalf of the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]].

[[As of March 2008]], [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], the [[President of France]], was the most recent person to present to both Houses at once.
