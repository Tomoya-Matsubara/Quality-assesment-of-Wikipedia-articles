'''Hurricane Betsy''' in 1956 was the first [[Atlantic hurricane]] to make [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in Puerto Rico in 24&nbsp;years. The third [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[1956 Atlantic hurricane season]], Betsy developed from a [[tropical wave]] on August&nbsp;9 to the east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It rapidly developed into a 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h) before striking [[Guadeloupe]]. There, Betsy heavily damaged 1000&nbsp;houses and left severe crop destruction, and there were 18&nbsp;deaths in the territory. As Betsy continued into the northeastern Caribbean, it capsized a ship, killing its crew of two.

On August&nbsp;12, Betsy struck southeastern Puerto Rico and quickly crossed the island. Damage was heaviest where it moved ashore and in the territory's central portion, and throughout Puerto Rico there were 15,023&nbsp;houses that were destroyed by Betsy. Multiple locations reported heavy crop damage, including Camuy which reported a complete loss of the corn crop. Hurricane Betsy was the first hurricane to be observed from the [[San Juan]] radar, and also resulted in the first [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane warning]] on the island to be released on television. The hurricane left $40&nbsp;million in damage and 16&nbsp;deaths, which prompted a federally declared disaster area. Locally the hurricane was known as the Santa Clara Hurricane. After exiting Puerto Rico, Betsy brushed the Bahamas before turning northeastward, becoming [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] on August&nbsp;18. The remnants dissipated two days later to the south of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Betsy 1956 track.png}}
Before Betsy's formation, the northeastward shift of the [[Azores High]] allowed for an increase in [[atmospheric instability]] across the tropical Atlantic, which made conditions for [[tropical cyclogenesis]] more favorable in early August.<ref name="mwr"/> A [[tropical wave]] exited the west coast of Africa on August&nbsp;4.<ref name="perez"/> On August&nbsp;9, a ship reported rough seas and winds of force&nbsp;10 on the [[Beaufort scale]].<ref name="mwr">{{cite journal|author=Gordon E.

On August&nbsp;12, Hurricane Betsy passed about {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Saint Croix]] before striking southeastern [[Puerto Rico]].<ref name="mwr"/> This made Betsy the first hurricane to strike the island since the [[1932 San Ciprian hurricane]].<ref name="pr">{{cite journal|author=Jos<U+00E9> A.

By that time, the storm had increased in size; the Hurricane Hunters reported that the gale force winds extended {{convert|125|mi|km|abbr=on}} to its north. The eye reformed on August&nbsp;14, becoming well-organized and attaining a minimum [[barometric pressure]] of {{convert|960|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}. The next day, Betsy turned to the northeast due to an approaching [[trough (meteorology)|trough]].<ref name="mwr"/> Despite beginning a weakening trend, the pressure dropped further to {{convert|954|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} on August&nbsp;17.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} The eye became increasingly poorly-defined,<ref name="mwr"/> and Betsy weakened to a tropical storm on August&nbsp;18 to the south of [[Nova Scotia]].

[[File:Betsy1956filledrainblk.gif|right|thumb|Rainfall summary of Hurricane Betsy in Puerto Rico]]
When the first advisory was issued on Betsy, a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane watch]] was issued from Barbados to [[Antigua]]. Around that time, a hurricane watch was also issued for Puerto Rico and the [[United States Virgin Islands]], which was later upgraded to a hurricane warning.<ref name="mwr"/> This was the first hurricane warning in Puerto Rico to be aired on television.<ref name="perez">{{cite web|author|page=30&ndash;31|date=September 2002|title=Notes on the Tropical Cyclones of Puerto Rico, 1508-1970|author=Orlando F<U+00E9>rez|accessdate=2011-10-15|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/data_sub/perez_21_34.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

The hurricane struck Guadeloupe with winds from 100&ndash;120&nbsp;mph (160&ndash;195&nbsp;km/h), which caused extensive damage to 1,000&nbsp;houses. The communications throughout the territory were disrupted. The high winds destroyed upwards of 60% of the banana, breadfruit, coconut, and papaya crop, which severely impacted the economy. Across the [[French West Indies]], the hurricane resulted in 18&nbsp;deaths and caused $10&nbsp;million in damage, $3.5&nbsp;million of which from crop damage.<ref name="mwr"/> In nearby [[Dominica]], winds reached {{convert|69|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name="perez"/> In Saint Croix, the hurricane dropped {{convert|3.20|in|mm|abbr=on}},<ref name="pr"/> while winds reached {{convert|86|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name="perez"/> In the northeastern Caribbean, Betsy capsized a ship and killed its crew of two.

When Betsy crossed Puerto Rico, it produced hurricane force winds across the entire territory except in the southwest corner. Sustained winds reached {{convert|73|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], and [[Ramey Air Force Base]] on the island's northwestern portion recorded {{convert|115|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gusts.<ref name="mwr"/> The high winds downed a significant number of trees in the island's interior due to the funneling within valleys. In [[Aibonito, Puerto Rico|Aibonito]], the winds destroyed 1000&nbsp;houses and damaged another 500, and in nearby [[Comer<U+00ED>o, Puerto Rico|Comer<U+00ED>o]] the winds severely damaged or destroyed 1285&nbsp;dwellings. In [[Jayuya, Puerto Rico|Jayuya]] in the central portion of the island, the hurricane left severe crop damage, including a complete loss to the banana crop. However, damage was heaviest in [[Yabucoa, Puerto Rico|Yabucoa]] near where Betsy moved ashore,<ref name="wn"/> due to a slight oscillation of the eye. High winds caused severe damage in a 20&nbsp;mi (32&nbsp;km) radius.<ref name="perez"/> In Yabucoa, over 12,000&nbsp;people were left homeless, and damage totaled $8&nbsp;million. Damage was likewise severe where Betsy moved offshore in Camuy, with a complete loss to the corn crop, 95% of the avocado, 65% of breadfruit, and 50% of the coffee crop ruined.<ref name="wn"/> The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall in the central portion of the island,<ref name="pr"/> with a peak 24&nbsp;hour total of {{convert|8.72|in|mm|abbr=on}} in [[R<U+00ED>o Grande, Puerto Rico|R<U+00ED>o Grande]].<ref name="perez"/> The same station recorded a total of {{convert|9.07|in|mm|abbr=on}}, which was the highest total related to Betsy's passage.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Roth|date=2008-09-28|title=Hurricane Betsy - August 11-13, 1956|accessdate=2011-10-15|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/betsy1956.html}}</ref> Across Puerto Rico, Betsy destroyed 15,023&nbsp;houses and left $40&nbsp;million in damage.

In San Salvador in the Bahamas, the hurricane produced wind gusts of {{convert|132|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and sustained winds reached 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h). The strm dropped about {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rainfall. Betsy destroyed several houses and wrecked the roofs of several churches. Hurricane Betsy left about $380,000 in damage in the Bahamas.<ref name="mwr"/> While delivering relief supplies to San Salvador Air Force Base, a [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II|Douglas C-124A-DL Globemaster II]] operated by the U.S. Air Force crashed. The plane had a right landing gear fail and as the result the plane skidded down the runway and came to a stop. Oone person was killed.<ref>{{cite web|date=2003-10-02|title=Accident description|accessdate=2011-10-15|publisher=Aviation Safety Network|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19650816-0}}</ref> Due to uncertainty in the storm's movement, officials issued a hurricane warning for southern Florida. Although Betsy remained far away from the state, its eye was observed on radar in Miami at a potentially record distance of {{convert|337|mi|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name="mwr"/>

In the [[Grand Banks]] offshore Canada, the hurricane sunk a ship, although the entire crew was rescued.<ref>{{cite web|author=Canadian Hurricane Centre|date=2010-11-09|title=1956-Betsy|accessdate=2011-10-141|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/Hurricane/default.asp?lang=En&n=E80F433C-1}}</ref>
