'''Typhoon Gay''' ([[Tropical cyclone naming#Western Pacific|international designation]]: '''''9230''''')<ref name="jma"/> was the strongest and longest-lasting storm of the [[1992 Pacific typhoon season]]. It formed on November&nbsp;13 near the [[International Date Line]] from a [[monsoon trough]], which also spawned two other systems. Gay later moved through the [[Marshall Islands]] as an intensifying [[typhoon]], and after passing through the country it reached its peak intensity over open waters. The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center|Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)]] estimated peak winds of 295&nbsp;km/h (185&nbsp;mph) and a minimum [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] of {{convert|872|mb|inHg|abbr=on}}. However, the [[Japan Meteorological Agency|Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)]], which is the official warning center in the western Pacific, estimated winds of 205&nbsp;km/h (125&nbsp;mph), with a pressure of {{convert|900|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}. Gay weakened rapidly after peaking due to interaction with another typhoon, and it struck [[Guam]] with winds of 160&nbsp;km/h (100&nbsp;mph) on November&nbsp;23. The typhoon briefly re-intensified before weakening and becoming [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] south of Japan on November&nbsp;29.

The typhoon first affected the Marshall Islands, where 5,000&nbsp;people became homeless and heavy crop damage was reported. The nation's capital of [[Majuro]] experienced power and water outages during the storm. There were no fatalities among Marshall Islands citizens, although the typhoon killed a sailor traveling around the world. When Gay struck Guam, it became the sixth typhoon of the year to affect the island. Most of the weaker structures had been destroyed during [[Typhoon Omar]] earlier in the year, resulting in little additional damage from Gay. Due to its substantial weakening, the typhoon had a disrupted inner-core and produced minimal rainfall. However, strong winds scorched the plants on Guam with saltwater, causing extensive defoliation. Further north, high waves from the typhoon destroyed a house on [[Saipan]], and heavy rainfall in [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]], [[Japan]] caused flooding and power outages.

==Meteorological history==
{{Storm path|Gay 1992 track.png}}
The origins of Typhoon Gay were from a tropical disturbance east of the [[International Date Line]] along a [[monsoon trough]] that extended west to the [[South China Sea]] in mid-November&nbsp;1992. The same trough had earlier spawned [[1992 Pacific typhoon season#Tropical Storm Forrest|Tropical Storm Forrest]] and would later create [[1992 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Hunt|Typhoon Hunt]]. The tropical disturbance moved westward across the dateline and gradually became better organized with increased [[convection (meteorology)|convection]]. On November&nbsp;14, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center|Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)]]{{#tag:ref|The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] is a joint [[United States Navy]]&nbsp;&ndash; [[United States Air Force]] task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for the western Pacific Ocean and other regions.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|title=Joint Typhoon Warning Center Mission Statement|year=2011|accessdate=2011-11-30|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070726103400/https://metocph.nmci.navy.mil/jtwc/menu/JTWC_mission.html}}</ref>|group="nb"}} issued a [[tropical cyclone formation alert]].

For most of Gay's existence, a strong [[anticyclone]] to its north steered the storm to the west or west-northwest. The JTWC upgraded the storm to [[typhoon]] status early on November&nbsp;17, and the JMA followed suit the next day. Gay first affected [[Mejit Island]] and eventually crossed the central portion of the [[Marshall Islands]]. Owing to favorable [[sea surface temperature]]s and upper-level [[wind shear|wind pattern]]s, the storm entered a phase of [[rapid deepening]] similar to other November typhoons near that location.<ref name="atcr"/> On November&nbsp;19, the JTWC upgraded Gay to a [[Typhoon#Intensity_classifications|super typhoon]], which is a typhoon with [[maximum sustained wind|1-minute sustained wind]]s of 240&nbsp;km/h (150&nbsp;mph). Gradual intensification ensued, and based on [[Dvorak technique|satellite estimates]], the JTWC estimated that Gay attained peak winds of 295&nbsp;km/h (185&nbsp;mph) at 0000&nbsp;UTC on November&nbsp;21.<ref name="jtwcbt"/> The agency also estimated that the typhoon reached a minimum [[barometric pressure]] of {{convert|872|mb|inHg|abbr=on}}, which would have made Gay the [[List of most intense tropical cyclones|most intense typhoon]] since [[Typhoon Tip]] in 1979.<ref name="atcr"/> At the same time, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 205&nbsp;km/h (125&nbsp;mph), with a pressure of {{convert|900|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}.<ref name="jma"/>

After Gay attained its peak intensity, [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] from Typhoon Hunt to its northwest increased the [[wind shear]] over the typhoon. The wind shear deteriorated Gay's northern [[eyewall]], causing the typhoon to weaken. In the 24&nbsp;hours after Gay reached its peak intensity, the JTWC estimated that the winds had decreased by 65&nbsp;km/h (40&nbsp;mph) to below super typhoon status; such rapid weakening is uncommon for a storm over open waters. [[Tropical cyclone forecast model]]s had anticipated Gay to make a turn to the north and northeast, but it maintained a west-northwest track toward [[Guam]]. Despite weakening steadily, the typhoon maintained a large size with a [[Radius of maximum wind|wind diameter]] of {{convert|1480|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Around 0000&nbsp;UTC on November&nbsp;23, Gay made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on Guam, becoming the third typhoon in three months to strike the island&mdash;the others were [[Typhoon Omar]] in August and Typhoon Brian in October.<ref name="atcr"/> Both the JTWC and the JMA estimated the typhoon to have had winds of 160&nbsp;km/h (100&nbsp;mph) at landfall.<ref name="atcr"/> The influence from Typhoon Hunt diminished after Gay affected Guam, allowing it to begin restrengthening. Late on November&nbsp;25, the JTWC estimated that the typhoon attained a secondary peak intensity of 215&nbsp;km/h (135&nbsp;mph). Gay subsequently slowed while moving along the western periphery of the [[subtropical ridge]], and it turned north while gradually weakening.<ref name="atcr"/> On November&nbsp;28, the JMA downgraded Gay to a tropical storm,<ref name="jma"/> and the JTWC followed suit the next day.<ref name="jtwcbt">{{cite web|publisher=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|date=2011-04-05|title=Best Track Data for Typhoon Gay (31W)|accessdate=2011-11-29|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/best_tracks/1992/1992s-bwp/bwp311992.txt|format=TXT}}</ref> The JMA assessed that Gay became an [[extratropical cyclone]] at 0000&nbsp;UTC on November&nbsp;30;<ref name="jma"/> however, the JTWC continued issuing advisories until December&nbsp;1, making it the longest-lasting typhoon of the season with 63&nbsp;advisories.<ref name="atcr"/> The remnant of Gay accelerated and turned to the northeast, passing to the southeast of Japan and crossing the International Date Line. The JMA last reported the storm on December&nbsp;4 near the [[Aleutian Islands]].<ref name="jma"/>

==Preparations and impact==
===Marshall Islands===
[[File:Typhoon Gay (1992).JPG|thumb|right|Satellite image of Gay at peak intensity]]
Typhoon Gay first affected the Marshall Islands, striking several atolls in the archipelago with typhoon-force winds. On [[Mejit Island]], the first island to be affected, the typhoon destroyed every wooden structure and left most of the islanders homeless. High winds downed all of the island's trees and destroyed 75% of the crops. Nearby, [[Ailuk Atoll]] experienced similar winds, though house damage was minor despite similar crop losses. The large wind field extended to the south, affecting [[Maloelap Atoll|Maloelap]] and [[Aur Atoll|Aur]] atolls with winds that damaged 30% of the houses and crops. Further south, the Marshall Islands capital city of [[Majuro]] experienced lightning strikes from the typhoon, which caused an island-wide power outage and cuts to the water supply and radio communication. Debris from the storm closed the [[Marshall Islands International Airport]] for two days. On [[Ujae Atoll]], the typhoon destroyed an automated meteorological observing station that had been installed in 1989. The typhoon left over 5,000&nbsp;people homeless across the country, but there were no native deaths and only one injury in the archipelago owing to well-executed warnings and preparations.<ref name="atcr"/> However, large waves from the typhoon sank a boat in a small lagoon, killing one of its two sailors.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sherryl Connelly|date=1999-06-03|title=A Lady In Distress ...

===Guam and Northern Marianas===
After affecting the Marshall Islands, Gay tracked toward Guam and became the fifth typhoon to come within {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the island in six months. Extensive preparations were made, including the sending of ships to mitigate damage<ref name="atcr"/> and flying [[United States Air Force]] planes to other bases in the region.<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=Guam, Northern Marianas Brace for Super Typhoon Gay|newspaper=The Item|date=1992-11-22|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HKYiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Hq8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=3597,6334926&dq=typhoon+gay&hl=en|accessdate=2011-12-05}}</ref> The schools, government buildings, airport, and port were closed, and about 4,300&nbsp;people evacuated to storm shelters. Further north, 1,639&nbsp;people evacuated to storm shelters on [[Saipan]], which set the record for the most storm evacuees at the time.<ref name="atcr"/> 

Despite weakening greatly from its peak intensity, Gay struck Guam with sustained winds of 160&nbsp;km/h (100&nbsp;mph), with gusts to 195&nbsp;km/h (120&nbsp;mph) on [[Nimitz Hill]].<ref name="atcr"/> The winds were strong enough to disrupt power and water utilities, as well as destroy a few houses.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Deseret News|date=1922-11-23|title=Typhoon Gay Blows Ashore in Guam|accessdate=2011-12-05|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/260488/CAPTION-ONLY--TYPHOON-GAY-BLOWS-ASHORE-IN-GUAM.html}}</ref> As a result of its weakening, Gay had a disrupted inner-core with little precipitation, which prompted the JTWC to label it as a "dry typhoon"; rainfall totals on the island ranged from only 40&ndash;90&nbsp;mm (1.5&ndash;3.5&nbsp;in).<ref name="atcr"/> Despite the extreme winds, little wind-thrown trees or snapped branches were observed. The combination of the winds and light rainfall, however, sprayed saltwater over the island's vegetation, leading to near island-wide [[defoliation]]. Majority of the local [[Dicotyledon|dicots]] withered and lost their leaves within two days after the storm, while other plants such as [[Arecaceae|palms]], [[cycad]]s and [[gymnosperm]]s retained their foliage but turned brown.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Alexander M.

The surge reached 3.4&nbsp;m (11&nbsp;ft) on [[Cabras Island]] in northern Guam, washing sand and water onto coastal roads and breaking a boat from its moorings.

On Saipan to its north, the storm surge destroyed one house and threatened the foundation of several others; twelve&nbsp;families required rescue by emergency workers. The storm caused power outages, and one house sustained fire damage due to candles and kerosene lamps.<ref name="atcr"/>

===Japan===
While Gay was becoming [[Extratropical cyclone#Extratropical transition|extratropical]], [[Okinawa Prefecture]] experienced heavy rainfall. The highest total was {{convert|322|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and one station recorded {{convert|27|mm|in|abbr=on}} in a ten-minute period. The rains flooded four buildings and inundated crop fields. Rough winds with gusts peaking at {{convert|82|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} caused isolated power outages and the cancellation of two airline flights.<ref>{{cite report|publisher=Digital Typhoon|title=Weather Disaster Report (1992-936-13)|language=Japanese|accessdate=2011-12-05|url=http://agora.ex.nii.ac.jp/cgi-bin/dt/report.pl?id=1992-936-13&lang=en}}</ref>

The rapid succession of typhoons in 1992 caused a significant drop in tourism in Guam.<ref>{{cite report|publisher=[[Legislature of Guam|Guam Legislature]]|author=Peter Ada|title=Testimony of Hideo Kobayashi President, JGTA on Bill Numbers 588 and 589|accessdate=2011-12-02|type=Transcript|at=PDF p. 4|date=August 1993|url=http://www.guamlegislature.com/Public_Laws_22nd/P.L.%2022-32%20(4).pdf|format=PDF|series=A collection of written testimonies on Bill Numbers 588 and 589 to the Committee on Tourism and Transportation of the Twenty-Second Guam Legislature|author=Hideo Kobayashi, President of Japan Guam Travel Association}}</ref> During typhoons Omar and Gay, there was little communication between residents on the island.

A research paper published ten years after the storm suggested that Gay could have been stronger than Typhoon Tip, which attained the lowest barometric pressure ever recorded. While at its peak intensity, Gay registered a rating of 8.0 for nine consecutive hours using the [[Dvorak technique]], indicating sustained wind speeds of at least (315&nbsp;km/h) 195&nbsp;mph. In addition, the cyclone had a significantly colder band of clouds around the eye. [[Typhoon Angela (1995)|Typhoon Angela]] in 1995 presented similar features and could have been stronger than Gay. Neither of the two had direct observations into their eyes, however, making it impossible to confirm such intensity.<ref>{{cite conference|author=Karl Hoarau, Gary Padgett, and Jean-Paul Hoarau|year=2004|title=Have there been any typhoons stronger than Super Typhoon Tip?|publisher=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=2011-12-05|url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/75465.pdf|conference=26th Conference on Hurricanes and Tropical Meteorology|conferenceurl=http://ams.confex.com/ams/26HURR/techprogram/programexpanded_212.htm|format=PDF|location=Miami, Florida}}</ref>
