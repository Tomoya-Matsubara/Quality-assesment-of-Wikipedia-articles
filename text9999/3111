'''Teos''' ({{lang-grc|<U+03A4><U+03AD><U+03C9><U+03C2>}}) or '''Teo''' was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city on the coast of [[Ionia]], on a peninsula between [[Chytrium]] and [[Myonnesus]]. It was founded by [[Minyans]] from [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]], [[Ionians]] and [[Boeotians]], but the date of its foundation is unknown. Teos was one of the twelve cities which formed the [[Ionian League]]. The city was situated on a low hilly [[isthmus]]. Its ruins are located to the south of the modern town S<U+0131><U+011F>ac<U+0131>k in the [[Seferihisar]] district of [[Izmir Province]], [[Turkey]].

==History==
[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] writes that the city was founded by [[Minyans]] from [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]] under the leadership of Athamas, a descendant of [[Athamas]] the son of Aeolus. Later on they were joined by [[Ionians]] and more colonists from [[Athens]] and [[Boeotia]].<ref name=paus />

Teos was a flourishing seaport with two fine harbours until [[Cyrus the Great]] invaded [[Lydia]] and [[Ionia]] (c. 540&nbsp;BC). The Teans found it prudent to retire overseas, to the newly founded colonies of [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] in [[Thrace]] and [[Phanagoria]] on the Asian side of the [[Cimmerian Bosporus]]. The port was revived by [[Antigonus Cyclops]]. During the times of the Roman emperors, the town was noted for its wine, a [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatre]] and Temple of [[Dionysus]]. These are positioned near the [[acropolis]], which is situated on a low hill and had fortifications by the 6th century. A shipwreck near Tekta<U+015F>, a small rock outcrop near Teos harbour, dates from the Classical period (around the 6th to the 4th centuries BC) and implies trading connections by sea with eastern [[Aegean Islands]].

It was a member of the [[Lydia]]n group of the Ionian League, one of the four groups defined by [[Herodotus]], based on the particular dialects of the cities. It was the birthplace of [[Anacreon (poet)|Anacreon]] the poet, [[Hecataeus of Abdera|Hecateus]] the historian, [[Protagoras]] the sophist, [[Scythinus]] the poet, [[Andron]] the geographer, [[Antimachus of Teos|Antimachus]] the epic poet and [[Apellicon of Teos|Apellicon]], the preserver of the works of [[Aristotle]]. [[Epicurus]] reportedly grew up in Teos and studied there under [[Nausiphanes]], a disciple of [[Democritus]].<ref name=strab-epic /><ref name=diog-epic /> [[Vitruvius]] notes [[Hermogenes of Priene]] as the architect of the [[cyclostyle|monopteral]] temple of [[Dionysus]] at Teos.<ref name=vitr />

==The site today==
The modern village of S<U+0131><U+011F>ac<U+0131>k is situated close to the ruins of Teos. The interior of what was previously the city has now been intensively farmed, which makes it difficult to excavate the site. Through ploughing, pottery has been brought to the surface of the earth, which has been collected through archaeological survey.
