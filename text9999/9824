The '''Clydesdale''' is a [[horse breed|breed]] of [[draft horse]] derived from the farm horses of [[Clydesdale]], [[Scotland]], and named after that region. Although originally one of the smaller breeds of draft horses, it is now a tall breed with impressive presence in harness. Often [[bay (horse)|bay]] in color, they show significant [[horse markings|white markings]] due to the presence of [[sabino horse|sabino patterning]]. The breed was originally used for agriculture and haulage, and is still used for draft purposes today. The [[Budweiser Clydesdales]] are some of the most famous Clydesdales, and other members of the breed are used as drum horses by the British [[Household Cavalry]]. They have also been used to create and improve other draft breeds.

The breed was developed from [[Flemish]] stallions imported to Scotland and crossed with local mares. The first recorded use of the name "Clydesdale" for the breed was in 1826, and by 1930 a system of hiring stallions had begun that resulted in the spread of Clydesdale horses throughout Scotland and into northern England. The first [[breed registry]] was formed in 1877. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, thousands of Clydesdales were exported from Scotland and sent throughout the world, including to Australia and New Zealand, where they became known as "the breed that built Australia". However, during [[World War I]] population numbers began to decline due to increasing mechanization and war conscription. This decline continued, and by the 1970s, the [[Rare Breeds Survival Trust]] considered the breed vulnerable to extinction. Population numbers have increased slightly in the intervening time, but they are still thought to be vulnerable.

==Breed characteristics==
The [[equine conformation|conformation]] of the Clydesdale has changed significantly throughout its history. In the 1920s and 30s, it was a compact horse smaller than the [[Shire horse|Shire]], [[Percheron]] and [[Belgian (horse)|Belgian]]. Beginning in the 1940s, breeding animals were [[selective breeding|selected]] to produce taller horses that looked more impressive in parades and shows. Today, the Clydesdale stands {{hands|16|to|18}} high and weighs {{convert|1800|to|2000|lbs|kg}}.<ref name=Dutson>Dutson, pp. 348-351</ref> Some mature males are larger, standing taller than 18 hands and weighing up to {{convert|2200|lbs|kg}}.<ref name=IMH/> The breed has a straight or slightly [[wikt:convex|convex]] facial profile,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clydesdalehorse.com.au/standards.html|title=The Clydesdale Horse - Breed Standards|publisher=Commonwealth Clydesdale Horse Society|accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref> broad forehead and wide muzzle. It is well-muscled and strong, with an arched neck, high [[withers]] and a sloped shoulder. Breed associations pay close attention to the quality of the [[hoof|hooves]] and legs, as well as the general [[horse gaits|movement]]. Their gaits are active, with clearly lifted hooves and a general impression of power and quality.<ref name=Dutson/> Clydesdales have been identified to be at risk for [[chronic progressive lymphedema]], a disease with clinical signs that include progressive swelling, [[hyperkeratosis]] and [[fibrosis]] of [[distal]] limbs that is similar to [[lymphedema|chronic lymphedema]] in humans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/elephantitis/about.html|title=Chronic Progressive Lymphedema (CPL) in Draft Horses|publisher=University of California, Davis|accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>

Clydesdales are usually [[bay (horse)|bay]] in color, but [[roan (horse)|roan]]<!--I'll have to source it, but there's a theory that all "roan" Clydes are actually a type of non-SB-1 sabino--><!--If you can source it, go ahead; I pretty much just pulled sources from the sabino article plus some other stuff I found, so more scholarly stuff would be good-->, [[black (horse)|black]], [[gray (horse)|gray]] and [[Chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] also occur. Most have [[horse markings|white markings]], including white on the face, feet, legs and occasional body spotting (generally on the lower belly).  They also have extensive [[feathering (horse)|feathering]] on their lower legs.<ref name=Dutson/> Roaning, body spotting and extensive white markings are thought to be the result of [[sabino horse|sabino genetics]]. Some Clydesdale breeders want white face and leg markings without the spotting on the body. To attempt getting the ideal set of markings, they often breed horses with only one white leg to horses with four white legs and sabino roaning on their bodies. On average, the result is a foal with the desired amount of white markings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apha.com/breed/geneticeq4.html|title=Sabino spotting|publisher=American Paint Horse Association|accessdate=2011-01-25}}</ref> Clydesdales do not have the SB1 (Sabino 1) gene responsible for causing sabino expressions in many other breeds, and researchers theorize that there are several other genes responsible for these patterns.<ref name=brooks2005>{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=Samantha |coauthors=Ernest Bailey |year=2005 |title=Exon skipping in the KIT gene causes a sabino spotting pattern in horses |journal=Mammalian Genome |volume=16 |pages=893<U+2013>902 |doi=10.1007/s00335-005-2472-y |pmid=16284805 |issue=11}}</ref> Many buyers pay a premium for bay and black horses, especially those with four white legs and white facial markings. Specific colors are often preferred over other physical traits, and some buyers will even choose horses with [[Lameness (equine)|soundness problems]] if they have the desired color and markings. Roan horses are not preferred by buyers, despite one draft breed writer theorizing that they are needed in order to keep the desired coat colors and texture.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.drafthorsejournal.com/read/autumn2009/stable-talk?tmpl=component&print=1|title=Stable Talk|author=Roy, Bruce|date=August 16, 2010|accessdate=2011-02-11|journal=The Draft Horse Journal}}</ref> Breed associations, however, state that there are no bad colors, and that horses with roaning and body spots are increasingly accepted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clydesdalehorsesociety.com/the_modern_clydesdale.html|title=The Modern Clydesdale|publisher=Clydesdale Horse Society|accessdate=2011-01-25}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Draft disc.jpg.jpg|thumb|right|Two Clydesdales in a plowing competition]]
The Clydesdale takes its name from [[Clydesdale]], the old name for [[Lanarkshire]], noted for the [[River Clyde]].<ref name=IMH>{{cite web|url=http://imh.org/horse-breeds-of-the-world/clydesdale/|title=Clydesdale|publisher=International Museum of the Horse|accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref> In the mid-18th century, three [[Flemish]] [[stallion]]s were imported to Scotland and bred to local [[mare]]s, resulting in [[foal]]s that were larger than the existing local stock. These were a {{hands|16.1}} [[driving (horse)|coach horse]] stallion named Blaze, a [[black (horse)|black]] unnamed stallion imported from England by a  John Paterson of [[Lochlyloch]] and an unnamed [[bay (horse)|dark-brown]] stallion owned by the [[James Douglas-Hamilton, 6th Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]]. Written pedigrees were kept of these foals beginning in the early 19th century, and in 1806 a [[filly]], later known as "Lampits mare" after the farm name of her owner, was born that traced her lineage to the black stallion. This mare is listed in the ancestry of almost every Clydesdale living today. One of her foals was Thompson's Black Horse (known as Glancer), who was to have a significant influence on the Clydesdale breed.<ref name=Society>{{cite web|url=http://www.clydesdalehorsesociety.com/breed_history.html|title=Breed History|publisher=Clydesdale Horse Society|accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref> The first recorded use of the name "Clydesdale" in reference to the breed was in 1826 at an exhibition in [[Glasgow]].<ref name=Hendricks/> Another theory of their origin, that of them descending from Flemish horses brought to Scotland as early as the 15th century, was also promulgated in the late 18th century. However, even the author of that theory admitted that the common story of their ancestry is more likely.<ref>Biddell, pp. 75-76</ref> 

A system of hiring stallions between districts existed in Scotland, with written records dating back to 1837.<ref name=IMH/> This program consisted of local agriculture improvement societies holding breed shows to choose the best stallion, whose owner was then awarded a monetary prize. The owner was then required, in return for additional monies, to take the stallion throughout a designated area, breeding to the local mares.<ref>McNeilage, p. 73</ref> Through this system and by purchase, Clydesdale stallions were sent throughout Scotland and into northern England. Through extensive [[crossbreed]]ing with local mares, these stallions spread the Clydesdale type throughout the areas where they were placed, and by 1840, Scottish draft horses and the Clydesdale were one and the same.<ref name=Hendricks>Hendricks, pp. 133-134</ref> In 1877, the Clydesdale Horse Society of Scotland was formed, followed in 1879 by the American Clydesdale Association (later renamed the Clydesdale Breeders of the USA) which served both American and Canadian breed enthusiasts. The first American [[stud book]] was published in 1882.<ref name=IMH/> In 1883, the short-lived Select Clydesdale Horse Society was founded to compete with the Clydesdale Horse Society. It was started by two breeders dedicated to improving the breed, who also were responsible in large part for the introduction of [[Shire horse|Shire]] blood into the Clydesdale.<ref name=Edwards>Edwards, pp. 284-285</ref> 
[[File:Clydesdale, draw.JPG|thumb|left|A 1904 drawing of a Clydesdale mare]]

Large numbers of Clydesdales were exported from Scotland in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with 1,617 stallions leaving the country in 1911 alone. Between 1884 and 1945, export certificates were issued for 20,183 horses. These horses were exported to other countries in the [[British Empire]], as well as North and South America, continental Europe and Russia.<ref name=Society/> [[World War I]] saw the conscription of thousands of [[Horses in World War I|horses]] for the war effort, and after the war breed numbers declined as farms became increasingly mechanized. This decline continued between the wars.  Following [[World War II]] the number of Clydesdale breeding stallions in England dropped from more than 200 in 1946 to 80 in 1949. By 1975, the [[Rare Breeds Survival Trust]] considered them vulnerable to extinction,<ref name=Dutson/> meaning there were fewer than 900 breeding females in the UK.<ref name=RBST>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbst.org.uk/watch-list/main|title=Watchlist|publisher=Rare Breeds Survival Trust|accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref> 

Many of the horses exported from Scotland in the 19th and 20th centuries went to Australia and New Zealand.<ref name=Dutson/> In 1918, the Commonwealth Clydesdale Horse Soociety was formed as the association for the breed in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clydesdalehorse.com.au/index.html|title=Our Purpose|publisher=Commonwealth Clydesdale Horse Society|accessdate=2011-01-25}}</ref> Between 1906 and 1936, Clydesdales were bred so extensively in Australia that other draft breeds were almost unknown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clydesdalehorse.com.au/history.shtml?1900|title=Our History - 1900 to 1930|publisher=Commonwealth Clydesdale Horse Society|accessdate=2011-01-25}}</ref> By the late 1960s it was noted that "Excellent Clydesdale horses are bred in Victoria and New Zealand; but, at least in the former place, it is considered advisable to keep up the type by frequent importations from England."<ref>Hayes, p. 361</ref> Over 25,000 Clydesdales were registered in Australia between 1924 and 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clydesdalehorse.com.au/history.shtml?1970|title=Our History - 1970 to present|publisher=Commonwealth Clydesdale Horse Society|accessdate=2011-01-25}}</ref> The popularity of the Clydesdale led to it being called "the breed that built Australia".<ref name=Edwards/>

In the 1990s, the breed's popularity and numbers began to rise. By 2005, the Rare Breeds Survival Trust had moved the breed to "at risk" status,<ref name=Dutson/> meaning there were fewer than 1,500 breeding females in the UK.<ref name=RBST/> However, by 2010 they had been moved back to vulnerable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbst.org.uk/watch-list/equines|title=Watchlist - Equines|publisher=Rare Breeds Survival Trust|accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref> The Clydesdale is considered to be at "watch" status by the [[American Livestock Breeds Conservancy]], meaning that as of 2010 less than 2,500 horses are registered annually in the USA and less than 10,000 exist worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albc-usa.org/documents/CPL_Equines2010.pdf|title=Conservation Priority Equine Breeds 2010|format=PDF|publisher=American Livestock Breeds Conservancy|accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref> As of 2010, there are estimated to be around 5,000 Clydesdales worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albc-usa.org/cpl/clydesdale.html|title=Clydesdale horse|publisher=American Livestock Breeds Conservancy|accessdate=2011-01-31}}</ref> with around 4,000 in the US and Canada,<ref name=Dutson/> 800 in the UK<ref name=Society/> and the rest in other countries, including Russia, Japan, Germany and South Africa.<ref name=Edwards/>

==Uses==
[[File:Budweiser Clydesdales Boston.jpg|The Budweiser Clydesdales|thumb|right]]

The Clydesdale was originally used for agriculture, hauling coal in Lanarkshire and heavy hauling in [[Glasgow]].<ref name=IMH/> Today, Clydesdales are still used for draft purposes, including agriculture, logging and driving. They are also [[draft horse showing|shown]] and ridden, as well as kept for pleasure. Some of the most famous members of the breed are the teams that make up the hitches of the [[Budweiser Clydesdales]]. These horses were first owned by the [[Anheuser-Busch|Budweiser Brewery]] at the end of [[Prohibition]] in the United States, and have since become an international symbol of both the breed and the brand. The Budweiser breeding program, with its strict standards of color and conformation, have influenced the look of the breed in the United States to the point that many people believe that Clydesdales are always [[bay (horse)|bay]] with [[Horse markings|white markings]].<ref name=Dutson/> As well as being driven, some Clydesdales are used for riding and can be shown under saddle.<ref>Smith, pp. 20-21</ref> Clydesdales and Shires are used by the British [[Household Cavalry]] as drum horses, leading parades on ceremonial and state occasions. The horses are eye-catching colors, including [[piebald]], [[skewbald]] and roan. To be used for this purpose, a drum horse must stand a minimum of {{hands|17}} high. They carry the Musical Ride Officer and two silver drums weighing {{convert|56|kg|lbs}} each.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article7082137.ece|journal=The Sunday Times|title=Digger, the horse who grew up to join the Army|date=March 31, 2010|accessdate=2011-01-24|author=Reid, Melanie}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicalride.co.uk/components/the_drum_horse|title=The Drum Horse|publisher=The Household Cavalry|accessdate=2011-02-03}}</ref> 

In the late 19th century, Clydesdale blood was added to the [[Irish Draft]] breed in an attempt to improve and reinvigorate that declining breed. However, these efforts were not seen as successful, as Irish Draft breeders thought the Clydesdale blood made their horses coarser and prone to lower leg defaults.<ref>Edwards, pp. 374-375</ref> The Clydesdale was instrumental in the creation of the [[Gypsy Vanner horse]], developed in Great Britain.<ref>Dutson, pp. 117-118</ref> The Clydesdale, along with other draft breeds, was also used to create the [[Australian Draught Horse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gattonheavyhorses.com/?page_id=5|title=Foundation Breeds|publisher=Clydesdale & Heavy Horse Field Days Association Inc|accessdate=2011-01-25}}</ref> In the early 20th century, they were often crossed with [[Dales Pony|Dales ponies]], creating mid-sized draft horses useful for pulling commercial wagons and military artillery.<ref>Dutson, p. 294</ref>
