'''Chattanooga''' is the fourth-largest city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Tennessee]] (after [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]), and the [[county seat|seat]] of [[Hamilton County, Tennessee|Hamilton County]]. Located in southeastern Tennessee on [[Chickamauga Lake]] and [[Nickajack Lake]], which are both part of the [[Tennessee River]], Chattanooga lies approximately {{convert|104|mi|km}} to the north-northwest of [[Atlanta, Georgia]], {{convert|120|mi|km}} to the southwest of Knoxville, about {{convert|135|mi|km}} to the southeast of Nashville, and about {{convert|148|mi|km}} to the northeast of [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. Chattanooga abuts the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] border, and the region is at the junction of three major [[interstate highway]]s, [[Interstate 24|I-24]], [[Interstate 75|I-75]], and [[Interstate 59|I-59]].

The city, which has a downtown elevation of approximately {{convert|680|ft|m}}, lies at the transition between the [[Ridge-and-valley Appalachians|ridge-and-valley]] portion of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and the [[Cumberland Plateau]]. The city is therefore surrounded by various mountains and ridges. The official nickname for Chattanooga is the Scenic City.

Chattanooga is ranked 8th out of Americas 100 largest metro areas for the best "Bang For Your Buck" city according to Forbes magazine.<ref>Forbe's December 2009, http://www.forbes.com/2009/11/30/cities-affordable-cheap-lifestyle-real-estate-housing-foreclosures_chart.html</ref> The study measured overall affordability, housing rates, and more.

==History==

The first inhabitants of the Chattanooga area were Native Americans. Sites dating back to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period showed continuous occupation through the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]], [[Woodland period|Woodland]], [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]]/[[Muskogean]] (900<U+2013>1650), and [[Cherokee]] (1776<U+2013>1838) periods.

The first part of the name "Chattanooga" derives from the [[Muskogean]] word ''cvto'' /chat<U+00F3>/ <U+2013> 'rock'.<ref>A Dictionary of Creek/Muskogee, Margaret McKane Mauldin</ref> The latter may be derived from a regional suffix ''-nunga'' meaning dwelling or dwelling place.

Cherokee Chief John Ross, whose first language was English and whose family moved to the area in the 19th century, was said to have stated<ref>folk etymology. source?</ref> that Chattanooga was Cherokee for "The Big Catch" because of good fishing on the [[Tennessee River]].

A late 19th century history recounted:
{{Quote|With only occasional allusion to the various interpretations of Cherokee names, which have so long been accepted as true, their actual meaning, as derived from John Ross, the celebrated Cherokee chief, and from Lewis Ross, his brother, are here given. ''Chattanooga'', originally was the name of a small Indian hamlet, situated near the base of Lookout Mountain, on the bank of Chattanooga creek. It means, in the Cherokee language, "to draw fish out of water", and hence was applied to the collection of huts, which were occupied by Indian fishermen.  The humble hamlet disappeared, and its name, at first suggestive and appropriate, was inherited by the town of the white man, with meaningless application.  A somewhat similar name was applied by the Cherokees to the cliffs, rising boldly from the river above the town, which was derived from ''Clanoowah'', the name of a warlike but diminutive hawk, which was supposed to embody the spirit of the tribe.  These cliffs were the favorite nesting-place of the bird, and hence a name was given which expressed this fact, and which, perhaps, has suggested the myth, that 'Chattanooga' means 'eagle's nest.'<ref>Thomas Budd Van Horne and Edward Ruger, ''History of the Army of the Cumberland'', 1875, p.407</ref>}}

The earliest Cherokee occupation dates from [[Dragging Canoe]], who in 1776 separated himself and moved downriver from the main tribe to establish American Indian resistance (see [[Chickamauga Wars]]) to European settlement in the southeastern United States.  In 1816 [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], who later became Principal Chief, settled here and established [[Ross's Landing]].  Located along what is now Broad Street, it became one of the centers of Cherokee Nation settlement, which also extended into Georgia and Alabama.<ref name=tehc/>

In 1838 the US government forced the Cherokees, along with other American Indians from southeastern U.S. states, to relocate in what is presently the state of [[Oklahoma]].  Their journey west became known as the "Trail of Tears" for their exile and fatalities along the way.  The US Army used [[Ross's Landing]] as the site of one of three large internment camps, or "emigration depots", where Native Americans were held prior to the journey on the [[Trail of Tears]].  The other two were [[Fort Payne, Alabama]] and the largest at [[Fort Cass]], Tennessee.<ref name=vott>Vicki Rozema, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Y7zgcpmg8vcC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=trail+of+tears,+emigration+depots&source=bl&ots=jx60asMNZF&sig=GQuHws155HTp72arN8yGG1_otm8&hl=en&ei=vFCMSpazLcyBtgeJyMTkBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false Voices from the Trail of Tears]. ''Voices from the Trail of Tears'', 2003. Retrieved 2009-08-19.</ref>

In 1838, the community of Ross's Landing incorporated as the city of Chattanooga, the [[Creek language|Creek]] word for [[Lookout Mountain]].<ref>[http://ngeorgia.com/tenn/chattanooga.html]</ref>  The city grew quickly, initially benefiting from a location well-suited for river commerce.  With the arrival of the railroad in 1850, Chattanooga became a boom town.  The city was known as the site "where cotton meets corn," referring to its location along the cultural boundary between the mountain communities of Southern Appalachia to the north and the cotton-growing states to the south.<ref name=tehc>Timothy Ezzell, [http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=C058 Chattanooga].

[[Image:Confederate-pows-chattanooga.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Confederate prisoners of war at a railroad depot in Chattanooga]]

During the [[American Civil War]], Chattanooga was a center of battle. During the [[Chickamauga Campaign]], [[Union Army|Union]] artillery [[Second Battle of Chattanooga|bombarded Chattanooga]] as a diversion and occupied it on September 9, 1863. Following the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], the defeated Union Army retreated to safety in Chattanooga. On November 23, 1863, the [[Chattanooga Campaign|Battles for Chattanooga]] began when [[Union Army|Union]] forces led by [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] reinforced troops at Chattanooga and advanced to Orchard Knob against [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] troops besieging the city. The next day, the [[Battle of Lookout Mountain]] was fought, driving the Confederates off the mountain. On November 25, Grant's army routed the Confederates in the [[Battle of Missionary Ridge]]. These battles were followed the next spring by the [[Atlanta Campaign]], beginning just over the nearby state line in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and moving southeastward.

[[Image:Market-street-chatt-1907.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Market Street in 1907]]

After the war ended, the city became a major [[railroad]] [[transportation hub|hub]] and [[heavy industry|industrial]] and manufacturing center.<ref name="city-data.com">[http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-South/Chattanooga-History.html]</ref> By the 1930s it was known as the "Dynamo of Dixie", inspiring the 1941 [[Glenn Miller]] [[big-band]] [[swing music|swing]] song "[[Chattanooga Choo Choo]]".  The same mountains that provided Chattanooga's scenic backdrop became shrouded by the industrial pollutants that they trapped and held over the community.

In 1969, the federal government declared that Chattanooga's air was the dirtiest in the nation.  But environmental crises were not the only problems plaguing the city.  Like other early industrial cities, Chattanooga entered the 1980s with serious socioeconomic challenges, including job layoffs due to de-industrialization, a deteriorating city infrastructure, racial tensions and social division. Because of these factors, Chattanooga's population declined by more than 10% in the 1980s. However, Chattanooga was the only major U.S. city to lose this proportion of its population in the 1980s and then regain growth in the next two decades.<ref name="timesfreepress.com">[http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2009/jul/07/city-populations-grow-shift/]</ref>

In recent years, private and governmental resources have been invested in transforming the city's tarnished image.  They have worked to revitalize its downtown and riverfront areas, making use of its natural resources.<ref>[http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2008/apr/27/chattanooga-looking-green-image-future----again/]</ref><ref>[http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2008/aug/14/chattanooga-green-focus-city-affirmed-image-makers/]</ref>  An early cornerstone of this project was the restoration of the historic [[Walnut Street Bridge (Tennessee)|Walnut Street Bridge]].  The Walnut Street Bridge is the oldest surviving bridge of its kind in the Southeastern United States.<ref name="bikekatytrail.com">[http://www.bikekatytrail.com/walnutstreet.asp]</ref>

Efforts to improve the city include the "21st Century Waterfront Plan" <U+2013> a $120 million redevelopment of the Chattanooga waterfront and downtown area. The [[Tennessee Aquarium]] has become a major waterfront attraction that has helped to spur neighborhood development.<ref>

Also downtown are the [[Creative Discovery Museum]], a hands-on children's museum dedicated to science, art, and music; an IMAX 3D Theatre; and the newly expanded [[Hunter Museum of American Art]].  The [[Tennessee Riverwalk]], an approximately {{convert|13|mi|km|adj=on}} long trail running alongside the river, is another attraction for both tourists and residents alike.

Across the river from downtown is the North Shore district, roughly bounded by the Olgiati Bridge to the west and Veterans Bridge to the east.  The newly renovated area draws locals and tourists to locally owned independent boutiques and restaurants, plus attractions along the Chattanooga Riverpark system, including [[Coolidge Park]] and [[Renaissance Park]]. Chattanooga's only floating hotel, the ''[[Delta Queen]]'', is a unique attraction alongside the North Shore, and is permanently docked at Coolidge Park.

The [[Chattanooga Zoo at Warner Park]] is located a short distance from the downtown area.

Parks and natural scenic areas provide other attractions.  The red-and-black painted "[[See Rock City]]" [[barn]]s along [[highway]]s in the [[U.S. Southern states|Southeast]] are remnants of a now-classic [[Americana]] [[tourism]] campaign to attract visitors to the [[Rock City]] [[tourist attraction]] in nearby [[Lookout Mountain, Georgia]]. The mountain is also the site of [[Ruby Falls]] and Craven's House.<ref>[http://ngeorgia.com/tenn/cravens.html]</ref> The [[Lookout Mountain Incline Railway]] is a steep [[funicular railway]] that rises from the [[St. Elmo Historic District (Chattanooga, Tennessee)|St. Elmo Historic District]] to the top of the mountain, where passengers can visit the [[National Park Service]]'s Point Park and the Battles for Chattanooga Museum.<ref>[http://roadsidegeorgia.com/site/pointpark.html]</ref> Formerly known as Confederama, it contains a diorama that details the [[Second Battle of Chattanooga|Battle of Chattanooga]].  From the military park, visitors can enjoy the panoramic views of [[Moccasin Bend]] and the Chattanooga skyline from the mountain's famous "point" or from vantage points along the well-marked [http://www.hikelookout.com trail system].

Near Chattanooga, the [[Raccoon Mountain Pumped Storage Plant|Raccoon Mountain Reservoir]], [[Raccoon Mountain Caverns]] and [[Reflection Riding Arboretum and Botanical Garden]] boast a number of outdoor and family fun opportunities. Other arboretums include [[Bonny Oaks Arboretum]], [[Cherokee Arboretum at Audubon Acres]] and [[Cherokee Trail Arboretum]].  The [[Ocoee River]], host to a number of events at the 1996 [[Atlanta Olympics]], features rafting, kayaking, camping and hiking.  Also just outside Chattanooga is the [[Lake Winnepesaukah]] amusement park. The [[Cumberland Trail]] begins in Signal Mountain, just outside of Chattanooga.

===Sports===

Chattanooga was the home of the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship]] game, which had been held at the [[Finley Stadium|Max Finley Stadium]], which is south of downtown, from 1997 to 2009. From 2010 to 2012, the [[Dallas, Texas]] suburb of [[Frisco, Texas|Frisco]] will host the NCAA Division I Football Championship game.

The [[Chattanooga Lookouts]], a Class [[minor league baseball|AA]] [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]] baseball team affiliated with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]],<ref>[http://www.lookouts.com/ Chattanooga Lookouts official site; affiliate stated on top right-hand corner of web page]</ref> boast a loyal following and respectable participation in season-end playoffs. Games take center stage at the downtown [[AT&T Field]] with tickets starting at only $4.

Annually, the first weekend in November, the Head of the Hooch rowing regatta, takes place in downtown Chattanooga.  The [[head race]] originally took place on the [[Chattahoochee River]] in [[Atlanta]], giving it the name the Head of the Hooch. With 1,800+ boats in 2009, this ranked as the 2nd largest regatta in the United States.<ref>[http://www.headofthehooch.org/ Head of the Hooch]</ref>  In addition to thousands of rowers descending on Chattanooga, there are festivities like hot-air balloon rides and a street market.

Chattanooga is also home to [[Chattanooga FC]], a semi-profesional soccer team that currently plays in the [[National Premier Soccer League]].

The [[Southern Chiefs Rugby League Football Club]] are a [[rugby league]] team who are hoping to compete in the [[AMNRL]] by 2012.

===Outdoor sports===

Due to its location at the junction of the [[Cumberland Plateau]] and the southern [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]], Chattanooga has become a haven for outdoor sports such as [[hunting]], [[fishing]], [[trail running]], [[road running]], adventure racing, rock climbing, mountain biking and road biking. The city boasts a number of outdoor clubs: Scenic City Velo, [[SORBA]]-Chattanooga, The Wilderness Trail Running Association, and The Chattanooga Track Club. The city also funds Outdoor Chattanooga, an organization focused on promoting outdoor recreation. In September 2004, the city appointed its first-ever executive director of Outdoor Chattanooga to implement the organization's mission, which includes promoting bicycling for transportation, recreation and active living.<ref>[http://www.outdoorchattanooga.com/387.htm]</ref> For paddlers, Chattanooga offers the [[Tennessee River Blueway]], a {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} recreational section of the [[Tennessee River]] that flows through Chattanooga and the [[Tennessee River Gorge]]. In the spring of 2009, the [[Tennessee Aquarium]] launched their high speed [[catamaran]], the ''River Gorge Explorer'', to allow up to 70 people to explore the [[Tennessee River Gorge]].<ref>[http://www.tnaqua.org/VisitorInfo/rge.asp]</ref> The ''Explorer'' departs from the Chattanooga Pier.<ref>[http://www.tnaqua.org/VisitorInfo/Boat_tour_highlights.asp]</ref>

[[Image:TNMap-doton-Chattanooga.PNG|right|Location of Chattanooga, Tennessee]]
The city is located at latitude 35<U+00B0>4' North, longitude  85<U+00B0>15' West.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 143.2&nbsp;square miles (370.8&nbsp;km<U+00B2>), of which, 135.2&nbsp;square miles (350.2&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of it is land and 8.0&nbsp;square miles (20.6&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of it (5.56%) is water.

The most prominent natural features in and around Chattanooga are the [[Tennessee River]] and the surrounding highlands. The city is nestled between the southwestern [[Ridge-and-valley Appalachians]] and the foot of [[Walden's Ridge]]; the river separates the ridge from the western side of downtown. Several miles east, the city is bisected by [[Missionary Ridge]], which hosted an important battle of the [[American Civil War]].

The Tennessee River is impounded by the [[Tennessee Valley Authority|TVA's]] [[Chickamauga Dam]] north of the downtown area. Five [[automobile]] [[bridge]]s, one railroad [[trestle]], and one [[pedestrian]] bridge cross the river.

Road [[transport]] is served by [[Interstate 75]] to [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] and [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], [[Interstate 24]] to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and [[Interstate 59]] to [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. Chattanooga and the surrounding area is served by the [[Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport]]. Rail freight is offered by [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] to Atlanta and Nashville, and [[Norfolk Southern]] to Atlanta, Birmingham, Cincinnati, Knoxville and Memphis.

===Neighborhoods===

In addition to the restoration of downtown, many of Chattanooga's neighborhoods have experienced a rebirth of their own.  Chattanooga has many buildings on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], including three neighborhoods: Fort Wood, Ferger Place, and St. Elmo. Additionally, Chattanooga has four local historic districts<U+2014>St. Elmo, Fort Wood, Battery Place and Ferger Place.

==Transportation==

Considered to be the gateway to the [[Deep South]], Chattanooga's transportation infrastructure has developed into a complex and intricate system of railroads, streets, airports and waterways.

===Principal highways===
* [[Interstate 24|I-24]]
* [[Interstate 75|I-75]]
* [[U.S. Highway 27|US-27]] North (formerly [[Interstate 124|I-124]])

===Tunnels===

*[[Bachmann Tubes]], (also unofficially known as The East Ridge Tunnels), which carry Ringgold Road into the neighboring city of [[East Ridge, Tennessee|East Ridge]].
*[[Missionary Ridge Tunnels]] (also unofficially known as McCallie or Brainerd Tunnels), which carry McCallie and Bailey Avenues through Missionary Ridge where the route continues as Brainerd Road.
*[[Stringer's Ridge Tunnel]], which carries Cherokee Boulevard through Stringer's Ridge where the route continues as Dayton Boulevard.
*[[Wilcox Tunnel]], which carries Wilcox Boulevard through Missionary Ridge and connects to Shallowford Road.

===Public transit===

The city is served by a publicly run bus company, the [[Chattanooga Area Regional Transportation Authority]]. CARTA operates 17 routes, including a free electric shuttle service in the downtown area, and free [[wifi|wireless internet]] on certain "smartbuses".<ref>http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_113678.asp ''[[The Chattanoogan]]'', September 19, 2007.</ref>

===Railroad lines===
[[Image:Chattanooga Choo-Choo train.jpg|thumb|[[Chattanooga Choo Choo]]]]
[[Image:Chattanooga Choo Choo.jpg|thumb|[[Chattanooga Choo Choo]]]]

Despite a new emphasis on the technology and service sectors, Chattanooga maintains ties to the past and still serves as a major [[freight]] hub with [[Norfolk Southern]] (NS) and [[CSX]] running trains on their own (and each other's) lines.   The Norfolk Southern Railway's enormous [[DeButts Yard]] is just east of [[downtown]], [[Shipp's Yard]] and CSX's [[Wauhatchie Yard]] are southwest of the city.  Indeed, the two railroad companies are among the largest individual landowners in the city (the [[United States Government|Federal Government]] is another).  The [[Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum]], the largest historic operating railroad in the [[Southern United States|South]], and the [[Chattooga and Chickamauga Railway]] also provides railroad service in Chattanooga.

Since both NS and CSX both run through Chattanooga, here are the lines that run through the town (the [[Association of American Railroads|AAR]] codes are used for the following railroads: NS for [[Norfolk Southern]], CSXT for [[CSX Transportation]], TNVR for the [[Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum]], and CCKY for [[Chattooga and Chickamauga Railway]]):
*CSXT <U+2013> [[Western and Atlantic Railroad|Western & Atlantic Subdivision]] (Chattanooga to [[Atlanta, Georgia]])
**[[Chattanooga Subdivision]] (Chattanooga to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] on former NC&StL trackage)
*NS <U+2013> [[Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific]], aka the Queen and Crescent Route (Chattanooga to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] via [[Lexington, Kentucky]])
**[[Alabama Great Southern Railroad|Alabama Great Southern]] (Chattanooga to [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] via [[Birmingham, Alabama]])
**Georgia Division (Chattanooga to Atlanta)
**Tennessee Division (Chattanooga to [[Knoxville, Tennessee]])
**[[Chattanooga Traction Company]]
***North Chattanooga to Signal Mountain
***Dry Valley Line (Red Bank to Lupton City)
*TNVR <U+2013> East Chattanooga to Grand Junction (3 miles)
**[[East Chattanooga Belt Line Railroad]] (from Debutts Yard and 17th Street, across to Holtzclaw Avenue and East Chattanooga, used by TNVR)
*CCKY <U+2013> formerly the [[Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia Railway|Tennessee Alabama & Georgia]] line (Chattanooga to [[Hedges, Georgia]])
**formerly the [[Central of Georgia Railway|Central of Georgia]] line (Chattanooga to [[Lyerly, Georgia]])
Also, the [[Lookout Mountain Incline Railway]], often referred to as the Incline Railway by locals, as well as being a tourist attraction, is sometimes used for commuting by Lookout Mountain residents, particularly during wintry weather, when travelling up and down the mountain could be very dangerous.

Despite the relatively high level of freight rail activity, there is no passenger rail service in the city for either commuters or long-distance travelers.

===Bridges===
[[Image:Walnut street bridge.jpg|center|thumb|650px|Bridges in Chattanooga]]

Being bisected by a major waterway, Chattanooga has several large bridges that allow people to traverse the [[Tennessee River]].  They are, from west to east:

* '''[[P.R. Olgiati Bridge]]''' <U+2013> Named for a former mayor, [[P.R. Olgiati]], this bridge, which was dedicated in 1959, carries [[U.S. Highway 27|"27"]] from downtown to [[Dayton, Tennessee]] and points northward.<ref name="city-data.com"/>

* '''[[Market Street Bridge (Chattanooga)|Market Street Bridge]]''' <U+2013> Officially called the [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]] Bridge. It is a [[bascule bridge|bascule]] span, which is a type of drawbridge. The bridge was completed in 1917 for the then-astronomical sum of USD $1,000,000.  Having stood for decades since its last major overhaul, the [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]] declared it unsafe in late 2004.

===Newspapers===
[[Image:Chattanooga Times Free Press office.JPG|thumb|right|The Chattanooga Times Free Press headquarters]]

The ''[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]'', the area's only daily newspaper, is published every morning. It was effectively formed in 1999 from two papers that had been bitter rivals for half a century, the ''Times'' and the ''News-Free Press''. The ''Times'' was once owned by [[Adolph Ochs]], who later bought the ''[[New York Times]]''. The ''Times'' had been the morning paper and had a generally more liberal editorial page. The ''News-Free Press'', whose name was the result of an earlier merger, was an afternoon daily and its editorials were more conservative than those in the ''Times''. In 1999, the ''Free Press'' was bought by an Arkansas company, [[WEHCO Media]], publisher of the ''[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]],'' which then bought The ''Times'' from the Ochs heirs. The ''Times Free Press'' is the only known newspaper in the United States to have 2 editorial pages, each reflecting opposite ends of the political spectrum. The Times' editorial page, which is liberal, is on the left page and the Free Press' editorial page, which is conservative, is on the right page.<ref>[http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2009/jan/04/our-unique-editorial-variety/]</ref>

The "Chattanooga Pulse" is a weekly alternative newspaper, published every Thursday. It was formed in 2003 by Zachary Cooper and Michael Kull, running independently until 2008, when the paper was purchased by local broadcast radio and website development firm Brewer Media Group. The newspaper shares news gathering resources with Brewer Media Group's WPLZ Pulse News 95.3FM news talk radio station, and the www.chattanoogapulse.com news website.
