'''Venom''' <!-- Please do not change this to "is". -->are<!-- This article is written in UK English, which treats collective nouns as plurals. (i.e. Venom ARE a band.) --> an English [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band<ref>Extreme metal according to [http://books.google.nl/books?id=9--qAVrfxukC&pg=PA2&sig=TbBHkM8Yx-0KDErPf2ZWO1Urrxk#PPA3,M1 Kahn-Harris, Keith, ''Extreme Metal: Music and Culture on the Edge'', Oxford: Berg, 2007, ISBN 1845203992]</ref> that formed in 1979 in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. Coming to prominence towards the end of the [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal]], Venom's first two albums<U+2014>''[[Welcome to Hell]]'' (1981) and ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'' (1982)<U+2014>are considered a major influence on [[thrash metal]] and [[extreme metal]] in general.<ref>Kahn-Harris, Keith, ''Extreme Metal: Music and Culture on the Edge'', Oxford: Berg, 2007, ISBN 1845203992</ref> Venom's second album proved influential enough that its title was used as the name of an extreme metal subgenre: [[black metal]].

==Band history==
===Early years (1978<U+2013>1981)===
Venom's original personnel came from three different bands: Guillotine, Oberon and DwarfStar. The original Guillotine featured [[Jeff "Mantas" Dunn|Jeffrey Dunn]] and Dave Rutherford on guitars, Dean Hewitt on bass guitar, Dave Blackman on vocals and Chris Mercaters on drums. Blackman and Mercater were replaced by drummer [[Anthony Bray]]  (b. 17 September 1957 in Newcastle) and vocalist Clive Archer of Oberon and soon after, Dean Hewitt was replaced by Alan Winston on bass. Around the summer of 1979, [[Conrad Lant]] from the bands DwarfStar and Album Graecum replaced Rutherford.  Around this time, the band adopted the Venom moniker.

Prime influences of the formative band were [[Black Sabbath]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Mot<U+00F6>rhead]]<ref name = fortunecity>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/sunra/315/venominterviewmantas.html |title=Mantas interview |publisher=www.fortunecity.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-10}}</ref> and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]].<ref name="fortunecity.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/sunra/315/venominterviewrichards.html |title=Cronos and Abbadon Interview |publisher=www.fortunecity.com |date=1963-01-15 |accessdate=2009-08-10}}</ref> Other bands cited by Venom as an inspiration are [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[The Who]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[Van Halen]], [[The Tubes]] and [[Rolling Stones]].<ref name="fortunecity.com" /> 

A few days before a show at a local church hall, Winston left the band. To fill in, Lant borrowed a bass guitar from Steve Thompson (later to become Venom's first producer). Playing the show with the borrowed bass plugged into his Marshall guitar amp and effects pedals, he created an unnerving racket and the 'Bulldozer Bass' was born.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Venom's lyrics often featured [[Satanism|Satanic]] references, and the band members took on new [[stage name]]s. Archer became '[[Jesus Christ]]', Lant 'Mr. [[Cronus|Cronos]]', Bray 'Tony [[Abaddon]]', and Dunn 'Jeff Mantas'.

In April 1980, the band recorded a three song disc, featuring "Angel Dust", "Raise the Dead", and "Red Light Fever". Soon afterward, six more tracks were recorded for just <U+00A3>50, with Lant taking vocal duties on the song "Live Like an Angel". Archer soon left the band, and Venom's line-up became a trio.

===Classic lineup (1981<U+2013>1986)===
Venom's recording debut was the 1981 single "In League with Satan"/"Live Like an Angel" which was released by [[Neat Records]]. Later that year they released their full-length debut, ''[[Welcome to Hell]]''.
[[File:Venom_cronos_live_hole_in_the_sky_bergen_norway_27_august_2010.jpg|210px|thumb|right|Cronos of Venom performing at [[Hole in the Sky]] in August 2010]]
Though crudely recorded with sometimes dubious musicianship, ''Welcome to Hell'' was still a remarkable ''tour de force'' for the era.  Venom's music was faster and harsher than most heavy metal contemporaries and while Satanism and other dark topics had been featured in metal before, the subject had rarely been more prominent.  Lant was quoted as saying that this celebration of evil subjects was inspired by the perceived need to out-do musicians like [[Ozzy Osbourne]] of Black Sabbath, who would 'sing about evil things and dark figures, and then spoil it all by going "Oh No, No Please God help me!"'<ref name="allmusic.com">[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:wifyxqedldfe MMV], reviewed by James Christopher Monger for Allmusic.com</ref>

Their second album, 1982's ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'' is cited as perhaps the most important influence in the development of [[black metal]], thrash metal, [[death metal]], and other related styles that are often grouped under the [[extreme metal]] umbrella.<ref>Khan-Harris, 2007</ref> Many defining elements of these genres are first found in the lyrics and song titles created by Lant and his unique singing style as well as the guitar work and solos performed by Dunn.  Though they would later be cited as important, neither of Venom<U+2019>s first two albums sold well upon their original release. And while many of their British metal peers had found measures of popular success or critical acclaim (or, like [[Def Leppard]], were moving away from metal towards [[hard rock]]), Venom were still regarded by critics as "a trio of [[buffoon]]s".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:jpfwxql5ldhe |title=At War with Satan: Review by Eduardo Rivadavia |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=2010-05-26}}</ref>

In an attempt to prove their status as serious musicians, Venom recorded ''[[At War with Satan]]'' in 1983. The epic 20-minute title track, with substantial [[progressive rock]] influences, took up the first side of the LP. The B-side was focused on the rapid-fire, three-minute "scorchers" Venom were known for.  In 1985, Venom released their fourth album, ''[[Possessed (album)|Possessed]]'', which was not as successful as previous albums. Dunn then left the band to pursue a solo career.

===Lineup changes and departure of Lant (1987<U+2013>1996)===
Two guitarists, Mike Hickey and Jim Clare, were hired to replace Dunn. Their fifth album, 1987's ''[[Calm Before the Storm (Venom album)|Calm Before the Storm]]'', moved away from Satanic themes in favor of [[Tolkien]]-esque <U+201C>[[Sword and Sorcery]]<U+201D> material.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:kpfwxql5ldhe Calm Before the Storm], reviewed by Steve Huey for Allmusic.com</ref>  This was even less successful than ''Possessed'', and Lant, Clare and Hickey all left Venom after subsequent touring to form Lant's eponymous solo band [[Cronos (band)|Cronos]].

Bray was left as the only group member, but he was able to convince [[Music for Nations]] for a deal to release a new Venom album on the Under One Flag label, using ''Deadline'' demo tracks which were recorded with previous line-ups but never released.  In 1988, Bray offered a vocals/bass role to [[Tony Dolan]] from [[Atomkraft]].  Bray and Dolan wrote new material prior to Dunn's rejoining the band along with rhythm guitarist Al Barnes.  Together they recorded ''[[Prime Evil (Venom album)|Prime Evil]]'' (1989), ''[[Tear Your Soul Apart]]'' (1990) and ''[[Temples of Ice]]'' (1991).  Barnes then left the band, and Steve White from Atomkraft was hired as replacement. They released ''[[The Waste Lands (album)|The Waste Lands]]'' in 1992, also without success.  Music for Nations refused to release any more Venom albums, so Dolan and Dunn quit, effectively disbanding Venom.  Bray continued to release compilation and live albums up to 1996.

===Reunion of classic lineup (1995<U+2013>1999)===
In 1995, Lant, Dunn and Bray reunited the "classic" line-up, beginning by headlining the Waldrock Festival on 24 June 1995. They recorded and self-released the ''[[Venom '96]]'' EP with four re-recorded and one new song, resulting in a record deal with the [[SPV GmbH|SPV]] label. An album, ''[[Cast in Stone]]'', was next released in 1997, split between new material and re-recordings of popular early-'80s songs.

===Recent work (1999<U+2013>present)===
Bray left Venom in 1999 and was replaced by Lant's brother [[Anthony Lant|Anthony "Antton" Lant]].  This lineup released ''[[Resurrection (Venom album)|Resurrection]]'' in 2000 on SPV.  However, in 2002 Dunn again left the group and was replaced by a returning Hickey.  In late 2005, Venom released a career-spanning 4-disc box set ''MMV'',  which includes an exclusive mini-poster of the band's seven-date tour of Europe with [[Metallica]] and a 60 page picture book, with interviews and pictures. The set includes all their best-known songs, along with rarities like live tracks, demos and outtakes.  This lineup of the band released the ''[[Metal Black]]'' album.

Hickey left the group 2007, with a guitarist calling himself Rage serving as his replacement.  This lineup released the record ''[[Hell (Venom album)|Hell]]'' in 2008.  Anthony Lant has since left the group and has been replaced by drummer Danny "Dante" Needham.

==Genre==
As Venom were one of the first incarnations of [[extreme metal]], influencing many [[thrash metal]], [[black metal]], [[death metal]] and other extreme metal bands,<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:dpfexql5ldhe |title=Welcome to Hell: Review by Eduardo Rivadavia |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=2010-05-26}}</ref>
their exact genre has been a topic of debate. Venom has been labeled various genres by members of the press. Most prominent genres are [[black metal]],<ref>Black metal according to (1) [http://www.rockdetector.com/artist,9828.sm Rockdetector.com] Venom page, (2) [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg%2edll?p=amg&sql=11:jiftxqr5ldde Allmusic.com] Venom page, (3) Black Metal review, (4) [http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=128 Metal-Archives.com] Venom page</ref> [[thrash metal]],<ref>Thrash metal according to (1) [http://books.google.nl/books?id=9--qAVrfxukC&pg=PA2&sig=TbBHkM8Yx-0KDErPf2ZWO1Urrxk#PPA3,M1 Kahn-Harris, Keith, ''Extreme Metal: Music and Culture on the Edge'', Oxford: Berg, 2007, ISBN 184520399], (2) [http://www.popmatters.com/pm/columns/article/54257/begrand060518 Popmatters.com] Yyrkoon - Unhealthy Opera review</ref> and [[speed metal]].<ref>Speed metal according to [http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=128 Metal-Archives.com] Venom page</ref>

==Legacy and Influence==
''Welcome To Hell'' influenced "literally thousands" of bands.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> Venom's music helped shape the development of many [[thrash metal]] bands, specifically the '''Big Four of Thrash''' (who in turn were highly influential): [[Metallica]], [[Slayer]], [[Anthrax (band)|Anthrax]] and [[Megadeth]] (Metallica opened for Venom on an early 1980s tour<ref name="allmusic.com"/> and Slayer played with them on the ''Combat Tour'' in 1985). Venom would also be of extreme importance to the [[black metal]] and even the early [[death metal]] scene, with numerous bands copying styles, themes and imagery from the band, such as the Swiss band Hellhammer which also helped pioneer the genres.

Venom often used Satanic and other 'evil' themes in their lyrics, but critic Bradley Torreano declared that the band had "their [[tongue in cheek|tongues planted firmly in their cheeks]]", with a sense of humor and irony that was sometimes lost on their fans and other musicians. Torreano adds that Venom "[caught] the attention of both metalheads and punks, the band was emulated by the former and turned into [[high camp|camp icons]] by the latter."<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:hbfrxqe0ldse In League With Satan] reviewed by Bradley Torreano for Allmusic.com</ref>

When asked about the criminal actions or violent behaviour of some later black metal bands (notably, there were a string of [[arson]]s and a few [[murder]]s in the Norwegian [[black metal]] community in the 1990s), Venom's members reportedly expressed disapproval, stating the point of Venom is to make controversial music, and "How can you make albums and tour if you are in jail?".{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==Criticism==
While many fans and musicians see Venom as an important band, their music has nonetheless been the subject of debate and criticism. Critic [[Eduardo Rivadavia]] of [[Allmusic]] writes that though ''Welcome to Hell'' influenced "literally thousands" of bands, Venom was "critically reviled" and composed of "incompetent musicians."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> However, critic James Christopher Monger declares that the members of Venom 'grew as musicians' as their careers progressed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:gbfuxqtaldse |title=Darkest Hour: Review by James Christopher Monger |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=2010-05-26}}</ref> [[Ethnography|Ethnographer]] Keith Kahn-Harris argues that Venom's limited technical skill, particularly early in their career, was a profound, though inadvertent factor in Venom's influence: being unable to mimic more technically proficient metal of their predecessors or peers, Venom instead opted to focus on sheer speed, creating music that was inspired by earlier metal, yet simultaneously blazed new trails.

In his [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] tour [[diary]], singer [[Henry Rollins]] wrote about a 1986 performance when Black Flag opened for Venom. He opines that Venom was hilarious, with mediocre playing and a stage performance focused on appearances rather than music; Rollins asserted that the musicians used portable fans to keep their hair flowing while on stage. Rollins wrote, "It was like seeing [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]] ... I expected them to go into 'Sex Farm' at any second."<ref>Rollins, Henry ''Get In The Van: On The Road With Black Flag'', 2.13.61 Publications, 1994</ref> Rollins writes that he and some tourmates drew magic marker [[pentagram]]s on their hands to flash at Venom and offer <U+201C>[[Hail Satan]]<U+201D> salutes. For their final number, Venom asked the audience to chant what Rollins thought was <U+201C>Black ''Funky'' Metal<U+201D>, which briefly made Rollins suspect that he had overlooked Venom's sense of humor, until he realized Venom was actually saying <U+201C>Black ''Fucking'' Metal.<U+201D> Venom reportedly laughed off Rollins<U+2019> comments saying "Henry didn't have the balls to speak to us back then, he hid backstage, but now he mouths off behind our backs.  His band was useless and that's why he writes books now. He even got the date of the show wrong.  Go write some more books and we'll keep making music."{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Venom's members were apparently well aware that their musical skills were questioned, especially by other bands. During a concert at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]] in 1984, guitarist Mantas was doing a between-song rant when he remarked rather loudly: "A lot of bands are out there tonight, waiting for Venom to make a mistake. Well, we are the fucking mistake!" <ref>Taken from audio track of: "The 7th date of Hell: Live at the Hammersmith Odeon" copyright 1984 Neat Records and Music (D.W.E. Ltd.)</ref>
