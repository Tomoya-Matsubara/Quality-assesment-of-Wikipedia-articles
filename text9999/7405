'''Gibraltar 1''' is the specimen name of a [[Neanderthal]] skull found in Forbes' Quarry at [[Gibraltar]] in 1848, by a Lieutenant Flint, a British officer with the [[Royal Navy]]. It has been dated to between 30 thousand to 50 thousand years old.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=T. M.|coauthors=Tafforeau, P., Reid, D. J., Pouech, J., Lazzari, V., Zermeno, J.

It was later examined by both Darwin and [[Thomas Huxley]], who concluded the skull was that of an extinct human species.

A cast of the skull is now at the [[Gibraltar Museum]] - the original is kept by the [[Natural History Museum]] in London
