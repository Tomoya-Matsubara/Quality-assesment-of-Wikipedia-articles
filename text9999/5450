'''Gerald Maurice Ronson''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (born 27 May 1939)<ref name = heroninternational>{{cite web|title=Gerald Ronson Briefing Note|url=http://www.heroninternational.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/gerald-ronson-briefing-note-f-12111.pdf|publisher=Heron International|accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> is a British business [[Business magnate|tycoon]] and philanthropist.

==Career==
Aged 15, Ronson left school and joined his father in the family furniture business, named [[Heron International|Heron]] after his father Henry. The company expanded into [[Real property|property]] (American usage real estate) development, at first with small residential projects, later with commercial and office properties too. By 1967 the company was active in seven European countries and fifty-two British municipalities. In the mid-1960s Ronson brought the first self-service petrol retail outlets to the United Kingdom.  Ronson once controlled almost a thousand of them, through a separate entity called Snax 24.

===Heron International===
{{main|Heron International}}
By the early 1980s Heron was one of the largest private companies in the United Kingdom, with assets of over <U+00A3>1.5 billion, but the company was over-extended and by the 1990s had almost collapsed with debts of <U+00A3>2.4 billion owed to 89 banks and 15,000 bondholders. The company survived with help from [[Bill Gates]], [[Rupert Murdoch]], [[Craig McCaw]], [[Oracle Corporation]]'s founder, [[Larry Ellison]], and others who gave loans to Heron.<ref>[http://www.building.co.uk/comment/a-guy-called-gerald/3081333.article "A Guy Named Gerald" 2007 Interview]</ref>

In addition to Heron International and Snax 24, Ronson's more recent additional business ventures include Ronson Capital Partners, an investment firm he established to invest opportunistically in real estate assets in the UK;<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Daniel|title=Ronson Sets Up Investment Group|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0dccaf96-639f-11e0-bd7f-00144feab49a.html|work=Financial Times|accessdate=28 December 2011}}</ref> and Rontec Investments, a consortium comprising Snax 24, Investec and Grovepoint Capital, created to acquire the assets of Total Oil UK.<ref>{{cite news|last=Goodley|first=Simon|title=Total Deal heralds comeback for veteran forecourt retailer Gerald Ronson|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/jun/21/total-deal-comeback-gerald-ronson|work=The Guardian|accessdate=28 December 2011|location=London|date=21 June 2011}}</ref>

By 1989, he was among the wealthiest people in the UK, listed by the Times with a net worth of UK<U+00A3>500 [[1000000 (number)|million]].<ref>[http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/sunday-times-rich-list-2013-1844234 Sunday Times Rich List 2013: Arsenal FC's billionaire co-owner Alisher Usmanov topples Lakshmi Mittal to take top spot] 20 April 2013</ref>

The Ronson family suffered from the 1990s commercial property crash: "The [Ronson] family lost $1 billion of its own money in the property crash of the early 1990s," Gerald Ronson says. "The important thing was to rebuild."<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB111696939992442152 Heron Chief Takes His Cue From Hollywood] By SARA SEDDON KILBINGER, The Wall Street Journal,25 May 2005</ref>

==Guinness Four==
Ronson became known in the UK as one of the "Guinness Four" for his involvement in the [[Guinness share-trading fraud]] of the 1980s, along with [[Ernest Saunders]] and occasional business associates [[Jack Lyons (financier)|Jack Lyons]] and [[Anthony Parnes]]. He was convicted in August 1990 of one charge of conspiracy, two of false accounting, and one of [[Theft#Theft in English law|theft]], and was fined <U+00A3>5 million and given a one-year jail sentence, of which he served six months. In 2000 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the 1990 trial had been unfair because there had been an improper collusion between the DTI inspectors and the prosecuting authorities.<ref>[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=696677&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 CMISKP website]</ref> A further appeal to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] Criminal Division, that sought to have the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]] 1998 applied retrospectively, and claimed that the [[Jury|trial jury]] had been "nobbled", failed in 2001.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1723136.stm BBC news, 21 December 2001]</ref> A final appeal to the House of Lords (now the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]) failed in 2002.<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldjudgmt/jd021114/lyons-1.htm House of Lords judgement in ''R v Lyons and others'', given November 2002]</ref>

When asked about his family and Jewish heritage in an interview with the [[Jewish Telegraph]], Ronson responded: "I am a proud Jew [...] when I go back to when I was a young boy, nothing has changed and that's how I look at the Ronson family, involved in school building, whether it be Israel, the Jewish Leadership Council, Jewish Care or most of the major organisations I've been involved in". He wants his four daughters, six grandchildren and eventual great-grandchildren to "understand who they are, what they are, what their background is and what their responsibility is. I've given them the tools to be able to continue doing those things in their life which I believe will make them good people".<ref name=jt/>
