The '''Earle Mack School of Law''' is the law school of [[Drexel University]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States|USA]]. The school opened in the fall of 2006 and was the first new law school in Philadelphia in over a thirty year time period,<ref name="BW">{{cite web|date=September 28, 2005 |title=Drexel University Board of Trustees Authorizes University to Open College of Law |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_Sept_28/ai_n15636669 |publisher=BusinessWire |accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref> and is the newest school within Drexel University.

==History==
In 2005, [[Drexel University]] announced its plans to create a new law school adjacent to the [[Drexel University Main Campus]] W. W. Hagerty library in [[West Philadelphia]]. That same year Drexel received approval from the [[Pennsylvania Department of Education]] to start the school.<ref name="BW" /> The decision to launch a law school with cooperative education in a city with five other law schools was based on a demand for graduates with immediate experience, with the president of Drexel University, [[Constantine Papadakis]], saying that employers "like to hire a graduate and have them immediately be useful."<ref name="CoOp" /> The Earle Mack School of Law joins [[Temple University Beasley School of Law|Temple University]], [[University of Pennsylvania Law School|University of Pennsylvania]], [[Villanova University School of Law|Villanova University]], [[Rutgers School of Law - Camden|Rutgers]], and [[Widener University School of Law|Widener University]] to become the sixth law school in the [[Delaware Valley]]. The School of Law is the first new law school  to be opened by a doctoral university in a twenty-five year period nationwide.<ref name="opening" />

[[Image:DUCOLconstruction.jpg|thumb|The School of Law building during construction in 2006]]
The inaugural class of the Earle Mack School of Law began classes on August 16, 2006. Due to a shortage of construction materials in 2006, caused in part by the need in the gulf coast due to [[Hurricane Katrina]], construction on the law school building was delayed, resulting in classes being held on Drexel University's Main Campus and within the Jenkins Law Library and the auditorium of the [[National Constitution Center]].<ref name="inaugural" /> The first class was expected to be composed of 120 students; ultimately, the inaugural class consisted of 183 students with an incoming GPA of 3.4 and an [[Law School Admission Test|LSAT]] score of 156.<ref name="pbj2">{{citation|date=November 2, 2007 |title=Drexel's law school hopes to be accredited by summer |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/othercities/philadelphia/stories/2007/11/05/story10.html?b=1194238800%5E1544181 |first=Jeff |last=Blumenthal |publisher=Philadelphia Business Journal |accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=August 11, 2006 |title=College of Law to open next week |url=http://www.thetriangle.org/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticle&ustory_id=b4e9f3d2-80c1-4ae1-88cd-1faab95c5222 |first=Aditi |last=Dubey |publisher=The Triangle |accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> The newest admitted class, the class of 2012, consists of 156 students with an incoming GPA of 3.4 and a median LSAT score of 160.<ref>{{cite web|date=September 3, 2009 |title=Drexel Law Fast Facts |url=http://drexel.edu/law/fastfacts.asp |publisher=Drexel University Earle Mack School of Law |accessdate=2009-10-08}}</ref> On May 1, 2008 the Drexel University College of Law was renamed the Earle Mack School of Law in honor of [[Earle I.

===Cooperative education===

Like Drexel University's [[The Ultimate Internship]], the Law School offers cooperative education for its students. The Law School is the second law school in the country to have a co-op program for law students, the first being [[Northeastern University, Boston|Northeastern University]].<ref name="CoOp">{{cite web| date =October 20, 2005| url =http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2005/10/20/new_co_op_law_school_will_compete_with_northeastern/| title =New co-op law school will compete with Northeastern|first=Sacha |last=Pfeiffer | publisher =The Boston Globe| accessdate =2006-12-28}}</ref> The first co-op cycle for the law school started in September 2007 and over ninety area corporations, law offices, judiciary positions, non-profit organizations, and government offices offered internship positions.<ref name="coop2">{{cite web| date =April 11, 2007| url =http://www.drexel.edu/law/coop-overview.asp| title =Law Co-op Education: Overview | publisher =Earle Mack School of Law |accessdate =2007-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=December 15, 2006 |title=Founding Father: Carl Oxholm III, GC of Drexel University |url=http://www.law.com/jsp/ihc/PubArticleIHC.jsp?id=1166004328273 |first=Brian |last=Baxter |publisher=Law.com |accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref><ref name="DUCoL">{{cite web| date =November 7, 2006| url =http://www.drexel.edu/law/coop-partners.asp | title =Law Co-op Education: Co-op Partners | publisher =Earle Mack School of Law| accessdate =2006-11-25}}</ref>

During their first year at law school students concentrate on basics such as legal writing and contracts before starting their first six month co-op cycle.<ref name="coop1">{{citation|date=April 28, 2006 |url=http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2006/05/01/story7.html |title=Drexel law school surpasses goal for 1st class admissions |first=Jeff |last=Blumenthal |publisher=Philadelphia Business Journal | accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref> In order to be eligible to participate in the program students must complete their first year with a minimum GPA and satisfy any job orientation that is required.
