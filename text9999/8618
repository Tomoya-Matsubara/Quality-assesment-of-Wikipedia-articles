'''Sir John Maxwell Stirling-Maxwell, 10th Baronet''', of [[Pollok]], [[Order of the Thistle|KT]] (6 June 1866 <U+2013> 30 May 1956) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Tory]] politician and [[philanthropist]].

The eldest son of [[Sir William Stirling-Maxwell, 9th Baronet]] and Lady Anna Maria Leslie-Melville, second daughter of [[David Leslie-Melville, 8th Earl of Leven]] and Elizabeth Anne Campbell, he was educated at [[Eton College]] and at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{Venn|id=STRN884J|name=Stirling-Maxwell, Sir John, Bart.}}</ref> He succeeded his father to the baronetcy in 1878.

In 1901 he married Ann Christian Maxwell, daughter of The Rt. Hon. [[Sir Herbert Maxwell, 7th Baronet]]. The couple had one daughter, [[Dame Anne Maxwell Macdonald, 11th Baronet]].

He was [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Glasgow College (UK Parliament constituency)|the College Division of Glasgow]] between 1895 and 1906, and later served as Chairman of the [[Forestry Commission]] from 1929<U+2013>1932.

He was a founder member of the [[National Trust for Scotland]] (1931), becoming one of its first Vice-Presidents and President from 1943 until his death.

After his death, his daughter gave [[Pollok House]], a substantial proportion of the [[Estate (land)|estate]] and her father's art collection to the [[Glasgow Corporation]].

In 1929 he was appointed a [[Order of the Thistle|Knight of the Thistle]]. He held the honorary degree of [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] from the [[University of Glasgow]], the [[University of Aberdeen]] and [[Edinburgh University]]. Hon. [[Royal Society of Arts|RSA]]; Hon.
