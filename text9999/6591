'''Sarah Strange''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] actress, known for work in a variety of American and Canadian television and film projects, most notably as Helen in the Canadian drama ''[[Da Vinci's Inquest]]''.  The daughter of [[screenwriter]]s L.S. and Marc Strange, she grew up in Canada's entertainment industry, and has appeared in comedic, dramatic, and science fiction projects on both big and small screens since graduating high school.  Strange has since garnered multiple [[Gemini Award]] nominations for her acting, winning an award for her guest role in the Canadian series ''Neon Rider'' at 21.

Currently, Strange is among the cast of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] romantic comedy-drama ''[[Men In Trees]]'', on which she portrays the town barmaid and a reconciling wife opposite [[Abraham Benrubi]].  The role comes two years after a previous series for the network, ''[[Life As We Know It]]'', on which Strange had a recurring role as the mother to [[Kelly Osbourne]]'s character.
