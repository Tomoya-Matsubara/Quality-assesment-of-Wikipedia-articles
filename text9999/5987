'''''Noronhomys vespuccii''''', also known as '''Vespucci's Rodent''',<ref>Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;1136</ref> is an [[extinction|extinct]] rat [[species]] from the islands of [[Fernando de Noronha]] off northeastern [[List of mammals of Brazil|Brazil]]. Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] may have seen it on a visit to Fernando de Noronha in 1503, but it subsequently became extinct, perhaps because of the exotic rats and mice introduced by the first explorers of the island. Numerous but fragmentary fossil remains of the animal, of uncertain but probably [[Holocene]] age, were discovered in 1973 and described in 1999.

''Noronhomys vespuccii'' was a fairly large rodent, larger than the [[black rat]] (''Rattus rattus''). A member of the family [[Cricetidae]] and subfamily [[Sigmodontinae]], it shares several distinctive characters with ''Holochilus'' and related genera within the tribe [[Oryzomyini]], including high-crowned molars with simplified crown features and the presence of several ridges on the skull which help anchor the chewing muscles. Although a suite of traits suggest that ''Holochilus'' is its closest relative, it is distinctive in many ways and is therefore classified in a separate [[genus]], '''''Noronhomys'''''. Its close relatives, including ''Holochilus'' and ''Lundomys'', are adapted to a [[semiaquatic]] lifestyle, spending much of their time in the water, but features of the ''Noronhomys'' bones suggest that it lost its semiaquatic lifestyle after arrival at its remote island.

==Discovery and taxonomy==
Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] may have seen this animal on [[Vespucci's fourth voyage|his fourth voyage]], which took him to Brazil;<ref name=CO2/> the ''[[Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle Isole Nuovamente in Quattro Suoi Viaggi]]''<ref name=CO44>Carleton and Olson, 1999, p.&nbsp;44</ref> recorded that he visited an island just south of the equator on August 10, 1503. On this island, identified as Fernando de Noronha, he saw "very big rats and lizards with two tails, and some snakes".<ref>Translation from the Italian by Branner, 1888, p.&nbsp;869, cited in Carleton and Olson, 1999, p.&nbsp;2</ref> The ''Lettera'' purports to be an account of Vespucci's voyages, but it is unlikely that he produced it himself and, additionally, his fourth voyage may never have actually taken place.<ref name=C046>Carleton and Olson, 1999, p.&nbsp;46</ref> The biological details given in the ''Lettera''{{'}}s account of Fernando de Noronha agree with what is known of the natural history of the island, lending weight to the view that it derives from an actual visit, whether by Vespucci himself or by another explorer. The lizard is probably ''[[Trachylepis atlantica]]'' and the record of snakes most likely refers to ''[[Amphisbaena ridleyi]]'', which is actually an [[amphisbaenia]]n instead of a snake.<ref name=CO48>Carleton and Olson, 1999, p.&nbsp;48</ref>

During excavations conducted in 1973, American ornithologist [[Storrs L. Olson]] found [[fossil]]s of a moderately large rat on Fernando de Noronha, which were described as a new genus and species in a 1999 publication by Olson and his colleague, mammalogist [[Michael D. Carleton|Michael&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Carleton]].<ref name=CO2>Carleton and Olson, 1999, p.&nbsp;2</ref> The material is now in the United States [[National Museum of Natural History]] in Washington, D.C., and in the museum of the [[Pontif<U+00ED>cia Universidade Cat<U+00F3>lica do Rio Grande do Sul]] in [[Porto Alegre]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. The [[name of a biological genus|generic name]], ''Noronhomys'', combines the name of the island of Fernando de Noronha with the Ancient Greek {{polytonic|<U+03BC><U+1FE6><U+03C2>}} ''mys'' "mouse"<ref name=CO10>Carleton and Olson, 1999, p.&nbsp;10</ref> and the [[specific name]], ''vespuccii'', honors Amerigo Vespucci.<ref name=CO12>Carleton and Olson, 1999, p.&nbsp;12</ref> ''Noronhomys'' would have been larger than the [[black rat]] (''Rattus rattus''), which was common on ships and which Vespucci would have been familiar with, consistent with his description of "very large rats".<ref name=CO48/>

''Noronhomys'' is a member of the [[tribe (taxonomy)|tribe]] [[Oryzomyini]], which includes over a hundred species distributed mainly in South America, including nearby islands such as the [[Gal<U+00E1>pagos Islands]] and some of the [[Antilles]]. Oryzomyini is one of several tribes recognized within the [[subfamily]] [[Sigmodontinae]], which encompasses hundreds of species found across South America and into southern North America. Sigmodontinae itself is the largest subfamily of the family [[Cricetidae]], other members of which include [[vole]]s, [[lemming]]s, [[hamster]]s, and [[Peromyscus|deermice]], all mainly from Eurasia and North America.<ref>Musser and Carleton, 2005</ref>

Carleton and Olson performed a detailed comparison of ''Noronhomys'' to members of the mainland genera ''[[Holochilus]]'' and ''[[Lundomys]]'' on the basis of both general [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[morphometrics|morphometrical]] data, concluding that the Fernando de Noronha rat is distinct from both other animals.<ref>Carleton and Olson, 1999, pp.&nbsp;16<U+2013>32</ref>
They used a [[cladistics|cladistic analysis]] to examine its relationships within Oryzomyini, also including two species of ''Holochilus'', ''Lundomys'', and five other oryzomyines. They found that ''Noronhomys'' appeared closest to ''Holochilus'', with ''Lundomys'' more distantly related. Eighteen shared characters ([[synapomorphy|synapomorphies]]) supported the grouping of ''Noronhomys'' with ''Holochilus''.<ref name=fig22>Carleton and Olson, 1999, fig.&nbsp;22</ref> Another form described as a species of ''Holochilus'', ''[[Holochilus primigenus]]'', may also be related, but is likely to fall outside the ''Holochilus<U+2013>Noronhomys'' [[clade]].<ref name=CO50>Carleton and Olson, 1999, p.&nbsp;50</ref>

In 1998, a fragmentary fossil of another species of this same group of oryzomyines was found in eastern Argentina. It was initially identified as a possible second species of ''Noronhomys'' on the basis of the presence of a crest on the upper first molar, the [[mesoloph]],<ref name=P1271>Pardi<U+00F1>as, 2008, p.&nbsp;1271</ref> but the specimen is different from ''Noronhomys vespuccii'' in other respects, and in 2008 it was described as a new genus and species, ''[[Carletonomys|Carletonomys cailoi]]'', related to ''Noronhomys'' and associated genera.<ref name=P1271/>

==Description==
[[File:Lundomys molitor type.png|thumb|alt=From top to bottom: side view of skull with mandible, missing the upper incisor and much of the posterior part; text "2. Hesperomys molitor"; and views of the same skull from above and below.|The skull of the living ''[[Lundomys|Lundomys molitor]]'' is similar to that of ''Noronhomys''.<ref name=CO16/> (The illustrated mandible is not of a ''Lundomys''.)<ref>Voss and Carleton, 1993, p.&nbsp;6</ref>]]
''Noronhomys vespuccii'' is known from a number of bone fragments, including five [[skull]]s, damaged to various degrees, and many isolated jaws and other bones.<ref>Carleton and Olson, 1999, pp.&nbsp;10<U+2013>11</ref> This material documents that, with a skull of about 4&nbsp;cm (1.6&nbsp;in) ([[occipitonasal length]]), ''Noronhomys'' was a moderately large oryzomyine, smaller than ''Lundomys'' but well within the range of ''Holochilus''.<ref name=CO9/> It shares a number of the features that characterize the group of ''Holochilus'' and related genera,<ref>Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;131</ref> including a reduction in the complexity of the chewing surface of the [[molar (tooth)|molars]],<ref name=CO16>Carleton and Olson, 1999, p.&nbsp;16</ref> simple [[posterolateral palatal pits]] (perforations of the [[palate]] near the third molar),<ref name=CO13>Carleton and Olson, 1999, p.&nbsp;13</ref> and a similarly shaped [[interorbital region]] of the skull.<ref>Carleton and Olson, 1999, pp.&nbsp;12<U+2013>13</ref> ''Noronhomys'' is distinctive, among other characters, in its lack of a spinous [[process (anatomy)|process]] on the [[zygomatic plate]], the flattened front portion of the [[zygomatic arch]] (cheekbone); the short palate, which does not extend behind the third molars; and the presence of an accessory crest, the mesoloph, on the upper molars.<ref name=CO9>Carleton and Olson, 1999, p.&nbsp;9</ref>

Analysis of morphometrical data from the known material of ''Noronhomys'' suggests that growth continued in adults<U+2014>the older the animal, the larger the depth of the [[mandible]] and the size of the lower [[incisor]]<ref>Carleton and Olson, 1999, p.&nbsp;27; table 5</ref><U+2014>and does not provide evidence for a [[sexual dimorphism|difference in size]] between males and females.<ref name=CO28>Carleton and Olson, 1999, p.&nbsp;28</ref> Skull shape is strikingly different from both ''Holochilus'' and ''Lundomys'', resulting in a clear separation from both of these taxa in statistical analyses of measurement data.<ref>Carleton and Olson, 1999, pp.&nbsp;29<U+2013>32</ref> In three individuals measured, the occipitonasal length, a measure of skull length, varies from 38.0 to 39.2&nbsp;mm (1.50 to 1.54&nbsp;in), averaging 38.5&nbsp;mm (1.52&nbsp;in). The width of the [[braincase]] is 13.4 to 14.8&nbsp;mm (0.53 to 0.58&nbsp;in), averaging 14.1&nbsp;mm (0.56&nbsp;in). Between the first molars, the width of the palate is 8.1 to 8.9&nbsp;mm (0.32 to 0.35&nbsp;in) in four specimens, averaging 8.4&nbsp;mm (0.33&nbsp;in).<ref>Carleton and Olson, 1999, table 1</ref> The lower molars have a total length of 7.57 to 8.29&nbsp;mm (0.298 to 0.326&nbsp;in), averaging 8.00&nbsp;mm (0.315&nbsp;in), in 39&nbsp;specimens with intact molar rows.<ref>Carleton and Olson, 1999, table&nbsp;2</ref> The [[femur]] (upper leg bone) is 32.5 to 41.0&nbsp;mm (1.28 to 1.61&nbsp;in) in length in nine specimens, averaging 36.5&nbsp;mm (1.44&nbsp;in).<ref>Carleton and Olson, 1999, table&nbsp;3</ref> Carleton and Olson estimated that body mass in ''Noronhomys'' was similar to that of some populations of living ''[[Holochilus sciureus]]'' at about 200 to 250&nbsp;g (7 to 9&nbsp;oz).<ref name=CO48/>

===Skull===
[[File:Fernando de Noronha Conceicao Beach.jpg|thumb|left|240px|alt=In the foreground, a wavy sea at the right and a yellow beach covered with black stones at the left. In the background, a mountain covered with green vegetation out of which towers a steep black rock.|View of Morro do Pico on Fernando de Noronha.]]
The skull is flattened in general shape. The front part is short and broad. The broad [[interorbital region]] (located between the eyes) is hourglass-shaped,<ref name=CO13/> with squared edges and weakly developed beading. A [[postorbital ridge]] is present, obscuring the [[suture (joint)|suture]] (joint) between the [[frontal bone|frontal]] and [[squamosal]] bones,<ref name=CO14>Carleton and Olson, 1999, p.&nbsp;14</ref> a feature shared only with ''Holochilus'' among oryzomyines.<ref>Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;30</ref> The braincase is squarish. The [[interparietal]] bone is wide, but does not reach the squamosals on the sides. The zygomatic arches, which are well-developed, are furthest apart at the back and converge toward the front. The [[jugal]] bone is small.<ref name=CO13/>

The back margin of the zygomatic plate is located close to the front of the upper first molar. The [[incisive foramen|incisive foramina]] do not extend between the molars.<ref name=CO13/> Unlike in both ''Holochilus'' and ''Lundomys'',<ref>Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;35</ref> the palate is flat, lacking a distinct ridge at the midline. The [[parapterygoid fossa]]e, which are located behind the palate at the level of the molars, are excavated somewhat above the level of the palate. A [[alisphenoid strut|strut of the alisphenoid bone]] is present, separating two openings in the skull, the [[masticatory<U+2013>buccinator foramen]] and the [[foramen ovale accessorius]].<ref name=CO13/> The [[subsquamosal fenestra]], an opening at the back of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal, is present but small. The squamosal probably lacks a suspensory process that contacts the [[tegmen tympani]], the roof of the [[tympanic cavity]],<ref name="CO16"/> a defining character of oryzomyines.<ref>Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;40</ref>

The mandible (lower jaw) is robust. The two [[masseteric ridge]]s, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, are joined together as a single crest for a portion of their length and extend forward to a point below the first molar. The [[capsular process]], a raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the lower incisor, is well developed.<ref name=CO16/>

===Teeth===
In the upper incisors, the chewing edges are located behind the vertical plane of the incisors; thus, they are [[opisthodont]].<ref name=CO16/> The microstructure of the [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] of the lower incisor was reported in a 2005 study. The inner portion (portio interna, PI) is much thicker than the outer portion (portio externa, PE). The PI consists of [[Hunter-Schreger band]]s, which are uniserial (consisting of a single enamel prism),<ref name=WM153>Weiss and Malabarba, 2005, pp.&nbsp;153<U+2013>154</ref> as in all [[Myomorpha|myomorph]] rodents.<ref>Kalthoff, 2000, p.&nbsp;16</ref> The PE consists of [[radial enamel]], with flattened prisms that are almost parallel to the junction between the enamel and the [[dentine]].<ref>Weiss and Malabarba, 2005, pp.&nbsp;153<U+2013>154; Kalthoff, 2000, p.&nbsp;17</ref> The microstructure is similar to that of ''[[Holochilus brasiliensis]]''<ref>Kalthoff, 2000, p.&nbsp;55</ref> and displays several characters seen only in Myomorpha.<ref>Weise and Malabarba, 2005, p.&nbsp;159</ref>
[[File:Map of Fernando de Noronha-en-fossil site.png|thumb|300px|alt=Map of an archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean. The main island is rod-shaped, oriented approximately west-southwest to east-northeast, with some irregular features in the coastline. A red label at the northeastern tip. Off the southern coast are nine smaller islands. Off the northeastern tip of the main island are five other smaller islands.|Map of the Fernando de Noronha archipelago, showing the fossil site where remains of ''Noronhomys'' have been found (in red).<ref>Carleton and Olson, 1999, fig.&nbsp;2</ref>]]
The molars are high-crowned ([[hypsodont]]) and planar, with the main cusps as high as the crests connecting them,<ref name=CO16/> a configuration shared only with ''Holochilus'' and ''Carletonomys'' among oryzomyines.<ref>Weksler, 2006, pp.&nbsp;43<U+2013>44; Pardi<U+00F1>as, 2008, table 2</ref> The first molars are the longest and the third molars are longer but narrower than the second molars. The molars lack many accessory ridges, including the [[anteroloph]] on the first upper molar, the [[posteroloph]] on the first and second upper molar, and the [[anterolophid]] and [[mesolophid]] on all lower molars. The first and second upper molar have a short mesoloph and the front cusp of the first lower molar, the anteroconid, encloses a large internal pit. Most of the folds between the cusps and crests are open at the margins of the molars, but two<U+2014>the [[posteroflexid]] on the lower second molar and the [[entoflexid]] on the lower third molar<U+2014>are closed by a wall, or [[Cingulum (tooth)|cingulum]], at the inner margin of the tooth. As in most oryzomyines, the upper molars all have one root on the inner (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side and the lower molars have a single root at the front and back of each molar; in addition, the first upper molar has another labial root and the first lower molar has a small labial and usually also a small lingual root located between the main roots.<ref name=CO16/>

===Postcranial skeleton===
The [[entepicondylar foramen]] is absent,<ref name=CO16/> as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this [[foramen]] (opening) perforates the distal (far) end of the [[humerus]] (upper arm bone).<ref>Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;55</ref> The [[pelvis]] and the bones of the hindlimbs are heavily built. The femoral tubercle of the [[acetabulum]] (part of the pelvis), which anchors the rectum femoris muscle, is reduced relative to ''Holochilus'' and ''Lundomys''.<ref name=CO21>Carleton and Olson, 1999, p.&nbsp;21</ref>

==Distribution and origin==
[[File:Mabuya maculata-001.png|thumb|left|250px|alt=Lizard, seen from the right, with its head bent to the right, on a rock.|The lizard ''[[Trachylepis atlantica]]'',<ref>Miralles et al., 2009, p.&nbsp;57</ref> which still lives on Fernando de Noronha, is one of the few other animals found on the island.<ref name=CO55>Carleton and Olson, 1999, p.&nbsp;55</ref>]]
''Noronhomys'' is known only from [[Fernando de Noronha]], a small archipelago of volcanic origin off northeastern Brazil, consisting of a main island and several associated smaller islands. The formation of the archipelago, which has never been connected to the mainland, began about 11&nbsp;million years ago; active [[vulcanism]] ceased about 2&nbsp;million years ago.<ref>Carleton and Olson, 1999, pp.&nbsp;5<U+2013>7</ref> Remains of ''Noronhomys'' were found in association with remains of various reptiles, birds, and snails, several of which are also restricted to the archipelago,<ref name=CO9/> in sand dunes near the northeastern tip of the main island.<ref name=CO8>Carleton and Olson, 1999, p.&nbsp;8</ref> The age of the deposits is unknown, but is likely late [[Holocene]], at most a few thousand years old.<ref name="CO2"/>

The ancestor of ''Noronhomys'' may have been a [[semiaquatic]] animal, similar to living ''Holochilus'' or ''Lundomys'', that arrived on Fernando de Noronha by chance on a floating log.<ref>Carleton and Olson, 1999, pp.&nbsp;55<U+2013>56</ref> The morphology of the limb bones in ''Noronhomys'' suggests that the animal was not semiaquatic like its relatives, but terrestrial, consistent with its occurrence on a small island, where streams and pools are rare or absent.<ref>Carleton and Olson, 1999, p.&nbsp;54</ref>

==Extinction==
Vespucci's account suggests that ''Noronhomys'' was common when the island was first visited, but it is not mentioned by the first biological explorers of the island, who conducted their research in the late 19th century. The [[introduced species|introduced]] black rat and [[house mouse]] (''Mus musculus''), which became very common on the island, may have driven it to extinction by directly competing for food, preying on young ''Noronhomys'', or transmitting diseases. Other factors that may have played a role include modification of its habitat, introduction of predators such as [[cat]]s (''Felis catus''), and predation by visiting sailors. These extinction mechanisms are common for island [[endemism|endemic]] species.<ref>Carleton and Olson, 1999, pp.&nbsp;48<U+2013>49</ref> The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] lists it as "extinct".<ref name=iucn/>
