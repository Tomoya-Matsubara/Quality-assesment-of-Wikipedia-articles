'''John McLean''' (February 4, 1791 <U+2013> October 14, 1830) was a [[United States Representative]] and a [[United States Senator|Senator]] from [[Illinois]].  

Born near [[Guilford Court House, North Carolina|Guilford Court House]] (now [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]]), [[Guilford County, North Carolina]], February 4, 1791, McLean moved with his parents to [[Logan County, Kentucky]] in 1795. He moved to [[Illinois Territory]] in 1815.  After studying law, he was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in [[Shawneetown, Illinois|Shawneetown]], [[Gallatin County, Illinois]].  When [[Illinois]] was admitted as a State into the Union, McLean was elected to the [[Fifteenth United States Congress|Fifteenth Congress]] and served from December 3, 1818, to March 3, 1819. He failed to be re-elected in 1818 to the [[Sixteenth United States Congress|Sixteenth Congress]].  He was also an unsuccessful candidate for congress in the  1820 and 1822 elections. He was elected to the [[Illinois State House of Representatives]] in 1820, 1826, and 1828, and served as speaker.  

In 1824, McLean was elected to the [[United States Senate]] to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of [[Ninian Edwards]] and served from November 23, 1824 to March 3, 1825. He was unsuccessful in a bid for re-election, not managing to get more than 12 votes of the 27 needed in the legislature through 10 ballots,<ref>Edwardsville Spectator, Dec. 7, 1824.</ref> but resumed the practice of law. 

He was again elected to the [[United States Senate]] and served from March 4, 1829, until his death, aged 39, in [[Shawneetown, Illinois]] in 1830. He was interred in Westwood Cemetery, near Shawneetown.
