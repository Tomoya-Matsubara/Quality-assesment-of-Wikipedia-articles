"'''Wheels'''" is the ninth episode of the [[United States|American]] television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''. Written by series creator [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] and directed by [[Paris Barclay]], the episode premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network on November 11, 2009. "Wheels" sees the [[glee club]] hold a bake sale to raise money for a handicap accessible bus, so that club member [[Artie Abrams|Artie]] ([[Kevin McHale (actor)|Kevin McHale]])<U+2014>who uses a wheelchair<U+2014>can travel with them to [[sectionals]]. [[Quinn Fabray|Quinn]] ([[Dianna Agron]]) struggles with the medical expenses incurred by her pregnancy, and [[Noah Puckerman|Puck]] ([[Mark Salling]]) renews his offer to support her. [[Sue Sylvester|Sue]] ([[Jane Lynch]]) accepts a student with [[Down syndrome]] onto the cheerleading squad, leading [[Will Schuester|Will]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]) to question her motives, and [[Kurt Hummel|Kurt]] ([[Chris Colfer]]) and [[Rachel Berry (Glee)|Rachel]] ([[Lea Michele]]) compete for a solo performance.

McHale called "Wheels" the "most serious" episode of ''Glee'' so far, while Murphy deemed it "the turning point for the show". The episode introduces two new characters, Lauren Potter as Becky Jackson and Robin Trocki as Jean Sylvester. It features covers of [[Nouvelle Vague (band)|Nouvelle Vague]]'s rendition of "[[Dancing with Myself]]", "[[Defying Gravity (song)|Defying Gravity]]" from ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' and [[Ike & Tina Turner]]'s rendition of "[[Proud Mary]]". "Dancing With Myself" is McHale's first solo performance on the show. "Defying Gravity" was included as a reflection of Colfer's own high school experience, which saw his drama teacher refuse to allow him to sing the song because of his sex. "Proud Mary" is staged entirely in wheelchairs, and was described by series choreographer Zach Woodlee as the "scariest" number produced to date.

"Wheels" was watched by 7.35 million US viewers, and saw Barclay nominated for the [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing <U+2013> Comedy Series|Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing of a Comedy Series]]. It prompted criticism from a committee of performers with disabilities, who felt that it was inappropriate to cast an able-bodied actor in a disabled role. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics, with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'s}} Tim Stack and Aly Semigran of [[MTV]] both writing that it brought them to tears. Reviewers Alan Sepinwall of ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' and Maureen Ryan of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' both commented positively on the episode, despite formerly having given unfavorable reviews of the series as a whole. In contrast, ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'s}} Mike Hale deemed the episode problematic, and Eric Goldman of [[IGN]] described it as "very afterschool special".<ref name="IGN"/>

==Plot==
Glee club director [[Will Schuester]] is informed that the school budget will not cover a handicap accessible bus to transport the [[glee club]] to [[sectionals]], meaning [[Artie Abrams|Artie]] will have to travel separately from the rest of the club. Will encourages the other club members to support Artie, not only by holding a bake sale to raise funds for a handicap bus, but also by spending time in wheelchairs to experience what life is like for him. Meanwhile, [[Quinn Fabray|Quinn]] is struggling to cover the medical expenses of her pregnancy, and threatens to break up with [[Finn Hudson|Finn]] if he cannot pay her [[ultrasound]] bill. [[Noah Puckerman|Puck]] fights with Finn, who he feels is not doing enough to support Quinn. By including [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] in the cupcakes, Puck ensures the bake sale is a success and offers Quinn the money raised. She apologizes for previously calling him a loser, but refuses to accept the money, and is relieved when Finn is able to find a job.

[[Kurt Hummel|Kurt]] and [[Rachel Berry (Glee)|Rachel]] compete for a solo on "[[Defying Gravity (song)|Defying Gravity]]". The part (normally performed by a female) is initially offered to Rachel, but when Kurt's father ([[Mike O'Malley]]) complains to [[Characters of Glee#Principal Figgins|Principal Figgins]] ([[Iqbal Theba]]) that his son is being discriminated against, Kurt is allowed to audition. His father receives an anonymous abusive phone call about his son's sexual orientation, and Kurt deliberately sabotages his own audition to spare his father further harassment. 

Artie reveals the origin of his disability to [[Tina Cohen-Chang|Tina]] ([[Jenna Ushkowitz]]), explaining that he was paralyzed in a car accident at the age of eight. He likens his wheelchair-use to Tina's [[speech impediment]]. The two go on a date and kiss, but part on bad terms when Tina confesses that she has been faking her speech impediment since the [[sixth grade]], in order to deflect attention from herself. 

Having previously removed Quinn from the cheerleading squad due to her pregnancy, coach [[Sue Sylvester]] is forced to hold open auditions to find a replacement. She accepts Becky Jackson, a [[sophomore]] student with [[Down syndrome]]. Will is suspicious of her motives, increasingly so when Sue donates money to the school to fund three new handicap ramps for students with disabilities. It is revealed to the audience that Sue's older sister Jean also has Down syndrome, and lives in a residential home for people with disabilities. The episode ends with the glee club performing "[[Proud Mary]]", staging the entire routine in wheelchairs in support of Artie.

==Production==
[[Kevin McHale (actor)|Kevin McHale]] has deemed "Wheels" the "most serious" episode of ''Glee'' so far.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedishrag/2009/10/video-scoop-kevin-mchale-pops-a-wheelie-on-glee.html|title=Video Scoop: Kevin McHale pops a wheelie on 'Glee'!|last=Snead|first=Elizabeth|date=October 26, 2009|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=28 October 2009}}</ref> He enjoyed Artie's character development in the episode, explaining that when he was cast in the role, he did not know Artie's background and thus made up his own backstory for him.

I think they will be a couple for a long time."<ref name="EO"/> He explained that from the beginning of the show's production, creator [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] expressed the belief that Artie and Tina should be together, and so he and [[Jenna Ushkowitz]] deliberately sat close to one another during filming, assuming that it would eventually happen. McHale was shocked by Artie's reaction to Tina's faked stutter, and was initially unsure "why he was being so dramatic". He concluded however: "I really think Artie fell for Tina because they were set apart by their disabilities. They're already kind of outcasts being in glee, but within that group they shared a connection. So he based their whole relationship on that and when it went away, Artie didn't know what to do."<ref name="NYP"/> McHale and Ushkowitz hope that their characters will ultimately become a couple, as they are best friends in real life.<ref name="EO"/>

Murphy selected "Defying Gravity" for the episode after Colfer relayed a story from his own high school days, whereby his drama teacher refused to let him sing the song because of his sex.<ref name="bs">{{cite web|url=http://www.backstage.com/bso/news-and-features-features/life-stages-1004009175.story|title=Life Stages |last=Kuhn|first=Sarah|date=September 3, 2009|work=[[Back Stage]]|publisher=Nielson Business Media|accessdate=5 September 2009}}</ref> Murphy explained: "I found a way to write it into the show because that's in a nutshell what this show is about: someone being told that they can't do something because of what the perception of them is as opposed to what their real ability is."<ref name="LAT"/> Colfer stated that the opportunity to finally sing the song "really meant the world to [him]", and that: "It's absolutely terrifying to watch yourself do something you've dreamed about for such a long time. I know I'm definitely not the best singer, but I think the message, the story behind the song about defying limits and borders placed by others, hopefully all that gets across with the performance. Although I do some very 'Kurtsy' things in the song, it's probably one of the most honest and close-to-heart scenes I've ever filmed or performed for that matter."<ref name="LAT"/>

"Dancing With Myself" is McHale's first solo performance on the show.<ref name="EO"/> Murphy commented that the performance is Artie's chance to "break away from being misunderstood by everyone" and express himself, explaining that although Artie is usually "a very secure guy" who does not care about others' opinions of him, "Wheels" sees his friends take his disability for granted: "So this performance is all about him saying, 'Look, this is who I am, and this is who I want to be.'"<ref name="LAT"/> McHale has stated that performing as Artie has made him more aware of the challenges that people with disabilities face: "It's a completely different side of life. More than ever, I realize how grateful I am to be able to get up between each take and walk around. I<U+2019>m glad that I can represent that kind of life on television so millions of people see it every week. And the whole point of it is to show that Artie can still do everything everyone else can that matters."<ref name="LAT"/>

''Glee'' choreographer Zach Woodlee described "Proud Mary" as the "scariest" number produced to date, citing concerns with choreographing an entire routine in wheelchairs and problems building the correct staging. Woodlee explained the stage ramps were initially built too steeply, preventing the actors from ascending them in wheelchairs, and that the actors experienced problems learning to distribute their weight correctly, flipping the wheelchairs over backwards: "It was like roller derby. All of the actors would fall backwards and hit their heads<U+2014>particularly [[Lea Michele]]. You lose your balance really quick when you try to go up a ramp in a wheelchair. [[Amber Riley]] caught an edge going down a ramp and fell off completely. There were pile-ups; there were crashes. Basically, everything that could go wrong, did."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/spinning_their_wheels_zv81BkmLdjAuHX1e5GQ7SK|title=Spinning their wheels|last=Albiniak|first=Paige|date=November 8, 2009|work=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|accessdate=9 November 2009}}</ref> Murphy specified to Woodlee that cast members should not be able to leave their wheelchairs during the number, as: "Artie doesn<U+2019>t get to get up ever, so I didn<U+2019>t want anyone to get up."<ref name="LAT"/> Woodlee agreed: "If it looked too fun and easy, it wouldn<U+2019>t read right.

===Critical reaction===
The episode attracted criticism from a committee of performers with disabilities, who felt that casting an able-bodied actor to play a disabled student was inappropriate.

Mike Hale of ''[[The New York Times]]'' felt that the episode was problematic.
