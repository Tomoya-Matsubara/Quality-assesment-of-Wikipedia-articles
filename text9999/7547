'''''Hulk''''' (also known as '''''The Hulk''''') is a [[2003 in film|2003]] [[superhero film]] based on the [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] [[Hulk (comics)|character of the same name]]. [[Ang Lee]] directed the film, which stars [[Eric Bana]] as Dr. Bruce Banner, as well as [[Jennifer Connelly]], [[Sam Elliott]], [[Nick Nolte]] and [[Josh Lucas]]. The film explores the origins of the Hulk, which is mainly attributed to Banner's father's experiments on himself, and passing these genes on to his son.

Development for the film started as far back as 1990. The film was at one point to be directed by [[Joe Johnston]] and then [[Jonathan Hensleigh]]. More scripts had been written by Hensleigh, [[John Turman]], [[Michael France]], [[Zak Penn]], [[J. J. Abrams]], [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]], [[Michael Tolkin]] and [[David Hayter]] before Ang Lee and [[James Schamus]]' involvement. ''Hulk'' was shot mostly in [[California]], primarily in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. The film was released with mixed reviews, and was a financial failure at the box office. This eventually lead to the 2008 film ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (which is a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]).

==Plot==
[[Brian Banner|David Banner]] is a [[genetics]] researcher who experiments on himself, trying to improve human DNA. Once his wife gives birth to their son Bruce, David realizes his mutant DNA has been passed on and attempts to find a cure for his son's condition. The government, represented by [["Thunderbolt" Ross|Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross]], shuts down his research after learning of his dangerous experiments. David, in a fit of rage, causes a massive explosion of the facilities' gamma reactor, and accidentally kills his wife. He is then put into a mental hospital, while 4-year-old Bruce is sent into foster care and adopted, taking on the last name of Krenzler, believing his biological parents are deceased. The events leave Bruce unable to conjure the memories into reality. 
 	 
Years later, Bruce is a brilliant researcher freshly graduated at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. The [[military-industrial complex]], represented by the unscrupulous [[Major Glenn Talbot|Major Talbot]], becomes interested in the research to build regenerating [[soldier]]s. David reappears and begins infiltrating Bruce's life, working as a janitor in the lab building. Ross, now an Army general, also begins to investigate. Ross, the estranged father of Bruce's ex-girlfriend and co-researcher [[Betty Ross]], becomes concerned both for his daughter's safety around Bruce, but also because Bruce is working in the same field as the father he does not remember.

Bruce succumbs to a scientific experiment accident. Afterwards, we see Bruce sitting in a hospital bed telling Betty that he's never felt better, which she can't fathom due to the fact that the nanomeds have killed everything else they've touched. The radiation has intertwined with Bruce's already-altered DNA. That night, his father confronts him, revealing their relationship and hinting at the mutation inside Bruce. Using Bruce's DNA, he begins experimentation on animals. Soon after, the building rage within him stemming from all of the stresses building up around him activates his gamma-radiated DNA, transforming Bruce into the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].
 	 
After the destruction at the lab, Bruce is found unconscious and at home by Betty. Bruce barely remembers his transformation, a sensation similar to birth. Ross arrives, suspicious, and places him under house arrest as well as taking over Bruce and Betty's lab. That night, David phones Bruce and tells him he has unleashed three mutant dogs to Betty's house. Enraged and attacked by Talbot, Bruce transforms again and, after seriously injuring Talbot and his henchmen, fights and kills all three dogs and saves Betty. The next morning, Bruce is tranquilized and taken to an enormous underground base in the desert. Betty tries to convince her father to allow her to attempt to help Bruce control his transformations, but Ross remains extremely skeptical, believing Bruce is "damned" to follow in his father's footsteps. In the meantime, David breaks into the lab and subjects himself to the nanomeds and the gammasphere, gaining the ability to meld with and absorb the properties of anything he can touch. 

Talbot, seeing an opportunity to profit from the Hulk's strength and regenerative capability, attacks and taunts Bruce, but fails. Talbot puts him in a sensory deprivation tank and induces a nightmare that triggers his repressed memories and transforms him into the Hulk, eventually leading to the death of Talbot. David confronts Betty and offers to turn himself in. In exchange, he asks to speak to Bruce "one last time." The Hulk escapes the base in the process. He battles the army in the desert, defeating four tanks and two [[RAH-66 Comanche|Comanche Helicopters]], and leaps all the way to [[San Francisco]] to find Betty again. Betty contacts her father and convinces him to take her to meet the Hulk, believing that he needs "a chance to calm down." Bruce's love for her comes through the Hulk, and he transforms back into his human form. David is allowed to visit the base and talk to Bruce. David, having descended into [[megalomania]], fails to convince Bruce to give him his power. David transforms into a powerful electrical being after biting into a wire and absorbing the energy. Bruce then transforms into the Hulk and battles his father. Both are presumed dead after Ross orders a Gamma Charge Bomb to end the fight, leaving no trace of either men. A year later there have still been numerous sightings of the Hulk. Bruce finds exile in the [[Amazon Rainforest]] as a doctor in a medical camp.

==Cast==
*'''[[Eric Bana]]''' as '''[[Hulk (comics)|Dr. Bruce Banner / Hulk]]''': Bana was cast in October 2001, signing for an additional two sequels.<ref name=Rider/> Ang Lee felt obligated to cast Bana upon seeing ''[[Chopper (film)|Chopper]]'', and first approached the actor in July 2001.<ref name=Chopper>{{cite news | author = [[Rob Worley]] | url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=2269 | title = Countdown to ''Hulk'': Ang Lee's new green destiny | publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = [[2003-06-19]] | accessdate = 2008-06-17}}</ref> The role was heavily pursued by other actors.

*'''[[Jennifer Connelly]]''' as '''[[Betty Ross Banner|Betty Ross]]''': Bruce's ex-girlfriend/co-researcher, as well as estranged daughter of General Ross. Betty is possibly the only way for the Hulk to lead back into his transformation of Bruce. Connelly was attracted to the role by way of director Ang Lee. "He's not talking about a guy running around in green tights and a glossy fun-filled movie for kids. He's talking along the lines of tragedy and psychodrama. I find it interesting, the green monster of rage and greed, jealousy and fear in all of us."<ref>{{cite news | title = Connelly Embraces ''The Hulk'' | publisher = [[Sci Fi Wire]] | date = [[2001-12-10]] | url = http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2001-12/10/13.00.film | accessdate=2008-06-09}}</ref>
*'''[[Sam Elliott]]''' as '''[[Thunderbolt Ross|General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross]]''': A four star general and estranged father of Betty.

*'''[[Nick Nolte]]''' as '''[[Brian Banner|David Banner]]''': The mentally unstable biological father of Bruce Banner who was also a genetics research scientist and had been locked away for several years for causing an explosion in the gamma reactor and accidentally killing his wife Edith. 
*'''[[Josh Lucas]]''' as '''[[Glenn Talbot|Major Glenn Talbot]]''': A ruthless former soldier who offers Banner and Betty Ross an opportunity to work for him in an attempt to start an experiment on self-healing soldiers.
*'''[[Cara Buono]]''' as '''Edith Banner''': Bruce's biological mother of whom he cannot remember. She is heard, but mostly appears in Bruce's nightmares.
*'''[[Celia Weston]]''' as '''Mrs. Krenzler''': Bruce's [[adoption|adoptive]] mother who cared for him after the death of Edith and David's incarceration.

==Development==
===Jonathan Hensleigh===
Producers [[Avi Arad]] and [[Gale Anne Hurd]] started the development for ''Hulk'' in 1990.<ref name=Hurd>{{cite news | author = [[Rob Worley]] | url = http://www.comics2film.com/index.php?a=story&b=1464 | title = Comic-Con: ''Hulk'', ''Hulk'', ''Hulk''! | publisher = Comics2Film | date = [[2002-08-06]] | accessdate = 2008-06-12}}</ref> By December 1992 [[Marvel Studios]] was in discussions with [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR101955 | title = Marvel Characters holding attraction for filmmakers | publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = [[1992-12-12]] | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}</ref> [[Michael France]] and [[Stan Lee]] were invited into Universal's offices in 1994, with France writing the script. Universal's concept was to have the Hulk battle [[terrorists]], an idea France disliked. [[John Turman]], a Hulk comic book fan, was brought to write the script in 1995, getting approval from Lee. Turman wrote ten drafts, being heavily influenced by the ''[[Tales to Astonish#The Hulk and the Sub-Mariner|Tales to Astonish]]'' issues, which pitted the Hulk against General Ross and the military. Universal had mixed feelings over Turman's script, but nonetheless future screenwriters used many elements brought by Turman.<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Rob Worley]] | url =http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=2191 | title = Countdown to ''Hulk'': Screenwriter John Turman talks about a fan's dream job | publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = [[2003-05-30]] | accessdate = 2008-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = [[Rob Worley]] | url =http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=2196 | title = Countdown to ''Hulk'': Screenwriter John Turman talks about ''Hulk'' and other heroes | publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = [[2003-06-01]] | accessdate = 2008-06-14}}</ref> By late 1996 Hurd's husband [[Jonathan Hensleigh]] signed on as a producers. [[Industrial Light & Magic]] was hired to use [[computer-generated imagery]] to create the Hulk. For the second time, France was invited to write the script.<ref name=Hughes>{{cite book | author = David Hughes | title = Comic Book Movies | publisher = [[Virgin Books]] | date = 2003 | location = [[London]] | pages = 261-269 | isbn = 0-7535-0767-6}}</ref> By April 1997 [[Joe Johnston]] was directing with the film's title as ''The Incredible Hulk''.<ref>{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117434784 | title = A Mania For Marvel | publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = [[1997-04-14]] | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}</ref> Universal wanted Hensleigh to write the script since he worked with Johnston on the financially successful ''[[Jumanji (film)|Jumanji]]''. France was fired before he wrote a single page, but received money from Universal. However, France still wanted to write the script.<ref name=Hughes/>

Johnston dropped out of directing in July 1997 in favor of ''[[October Sky]]'', paving the way for Hensleigh to have his directing debut. Turman was brought back a second time to write two more drafts, the second of which was rewritten by [[Zak Penn]].<ref>{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116677365 | title = ''Hoop'' duo go hip-hop | publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = [[1997-07-08]] | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}</ref><ref name=Hughes/> Turman's script featured the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] and [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], as well as the canonical atomic explosion origin from the comics.

This transforms the convicts into "insect men" that cause havoc.<ref name=bulk/><ref name=Hughes/>

Filming was set to start in December 1997 in [[Arizona]] for a mid-1999 release date, but was pushed back to April 1998.<ref name=Karon/><ref name=bulk>{{cite news | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116675959 | title = U bulks up ''Hulk'' | publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = [[1997-08-11]] | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}</ref> Hensleigh subsequently rewrote the script with [[J. J. Abrams]]. [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]] were also brought on board to rewrite with Hensleigh still attached as director.<ref name=Hughes/> In October 1997, ''Hulk'' had entered [[pre-production]] with the creation of [[prosthetic makeup]] and [[computer animation]] already under way. Gregory Sporleder was cast as "Novak", Banner's [[archenemy]]. [[Lynn "Red" Williams]] was cast as a convict who transforms into a combination of human, ant and beetle.<ref name=Karon>{{cite news | author = Paul Karon | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116674626 | title = U adds duo to ''Hulk'' cast | publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = [[1997-10-31]] | accessdate = 2008-06-02}}</ref> In March 1998 Universal put ''Hulk'' on [[hiatus]] due to its escalating $100 million budget and worries of Hensleigh directing his first film. $20 million was already spent on script development, computer animation and prosthetics work. Hensleigh immediately went to rewrite the script in order to lower the budget.<ref>{{cite news | author = Chris Petrikin | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117468230 | title = U has ''Hulk'' take a seat | publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = [[1998-03-02]] | accessdate = 2008-06-02}}</ref>

===Michael France===
Hensleigh found the rewriting process to be too difficult and dropped out, and felt he "wasted nine months in [[pre-production]]".<ref>{{cite news | author = Ken P | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/496/496784p2.html | title = An Interview With Jonathan Hensleigh | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2004-03-05]] | accessdate = 2008-06-11}}</ref> It took another eight months for France to convince Universal and the producers to let him try to write a script for a third time. France claimed "Someone within the Universal hierarchy wasn't sure it this was a [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[adventure film|adventure]], or a [[comedy film|comedy]], and I kept getting directions to write both. I think that at some point when I wasn't in the room, there may have been discussions about turning it into a [[Jim Carrey]] or [[Adam Sandler]] movie."<ref name=Hughes/> France was writing the script on [[fast track]] from July&mdash;September 1999. Filming for ''The Incredible Hulk'' was to start in April 2000.<ref>{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117503960 | title = Marvel takes cue from its superheroes | publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = [[1999-07-13]] | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117755342 | title = Stewart goes boldly; renewed U fills its slate | publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = [[1999-09-02]] | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}</ref>

France stated his vision of the film was different from the other drafts, which based Bruce Banner on his "amiable, [[nerd]]y genius" incarnation in the 1960s. France cited inspiration from the 1980s Hulk stories which introduced [[Brian Banner]], Bruce's abusive father who killed his mother. His script had Banner trying to create cells with regenerative capabilities in order to prove to himself that he is not like his father.<ref name=Hughes/> However, he has [[anger management]] issues before the Hulk is even created, which makes everything worse. The "Don't make me angry..." line from the [[The Incredible Hulk (TV series)|TV series]] was made into dialogue that Banner's father would say before beating his son. Elements such as the "Gammasphere", Banner's tragic romance with Ross, and the [[black op]]s made it to the final film. France turned in his final drafts in late 1999&mdash;January 2000.<ref name=Hughes/>

===Ang Lee===
[[Michael Tolkin]] and [[David Hayter]] rewrote the script afterwards, despite positive response from the producers over France's script. Tolkin was brought in January 2000, while Hayter was brought in September of that year. Hayter's draft featured [[Leader (comics) | The Leader]], [[Zzzax]] and the [[Absorbing Man]] as the villains, who are depicted as colleagues of Banner and get caught in the same accident that creates the Hulk.<ref name=Hughes/><ref>{{cite news | author = KJB | title = David Hater Talks ''Hulk'' | publisher = [[IGN]] | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/036/036564p1.html | accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = Dayna Van Buskirk | title = Feature Article: The Lost ''Hulk'': David Hayter's Draft | publisher = [[UGO Networks]] | url = http://screenwriting.ugo.com/film/incrediblehulkbyhayter.php | accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref> Director [[Ang Lee]] and his producing partner [[James Schamus]] became involved with the film in January 2001.<ref>{{cite news | author = Cathy Dunkley | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117791724.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title = From ''Tiger'' to U's ''Hulk'' for helmer | publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = [[2001-01-12]] | accessdate = 2008-06-02}}</ref> Lee was dissatisfied with Hayter's script, and commissioned Schamus for a rewrite, merging Banner's father with the Absorbing Man to create a physical antagonist.<ref>{{cite news | author = Andy Seiler | url = http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/2001-04-13-ang-lee.htm#more | title = Ang Lee gets inside Hulk's head | publisher = [[USA Today]] | date = [[2001-04-13]] | accessdate = 2008-06-11}}</ref><ref name=Hughes/> Lee claimed he cited influences from ''[[King Kong]]'', ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Jekyll and Hyde]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Faust]]'' and [[Greek mythology]] for his interpretation of the story.<ref>{{cite news | author = Scott B | title = An Interview with Ang Lee | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2003-06-17]] | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/424/424621p1.html | accessdate=2007-04-16}}</ref> Schamus said he had found Peter David's storyline that introduced Brian Banner, thus allowing Lee to write a drama that again explored father-son themes.<ref name="beast">{{cite news | author = Adam Smith | title = The Beast Within | pages = 66-77 | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = [[2003-05-30]]}}</ref>

France criticized Schamus and Hayter for claiming they were aiming to make Banner a deeper character, and was saddened they had denigrated his and Turman's work in interviews. Schamus elected to get solo credit. France felt, "James Schamus did a significant amount of work on the screenplay. For example, he brought in the Hulk dogs from the comics and he made the decision to use Banner's father as a real character in the present. But he used quite a lot of elements from John Turman's scripts and quite a lot from mine, and that's why we were credited."<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Rob Worley]] | url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=2258 | title = Countdown to 'Hulk': Screenwriter Michael France talks ''Hulk'', ''Punisher'' and Beyond | publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = [[2003-06-17]] | accessdate = 2008-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = [[Rob Worley]] | url =http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=2206 | title = Countdown to ''Hulk'': Producers Avi Arad and Gale Anne Hurd talk | publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = [[2003-06-05]] | accessdate = 2008-06-13}}</ref><ref name=Hughes/> France, Turman and Schamus received final credit.

Eric Bana commented that the shoot was, "Ridiculously serious... a silent set, morbid in a lot of ways."
