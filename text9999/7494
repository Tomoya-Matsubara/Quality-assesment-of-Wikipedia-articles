"'''Silvia'''" is a song performed by Swedish [[indie pop]] band [[Miike Snow]]. Written and produced by the band, it is a six-minute [[electronic music|electronic]] piano ballad with drum, piano and synthesizer instrumentation and [[electro house]] beats. Lyrically, it speaks of longing and lead singer [[Andrew Wyatt]]'s vocals are edited with [[Auto-Tune]]. "Silvia" served as the third and final single from the band's 2009 [[Miike Snow (album)|self-titled debut album]]. [[Columbia Records]] first [[music download|digitally]] released it as a remix [[extended play]] (EP) on 22 January 2010. Band members [[Bloodshy & Avant|Christian Karlsson]] and [[Bloodshy & Avant|Pontus Winnberg]] contributed their own remix to the release, using the alias Robotberget.

Critical reception of "Silvia" was generally positive; many critics deemed it the album's centerpiece and criticized its early placement as the third track on ''Miike Snow''. The single achieved minor chart success in the United Kingdom; it became the band's second entry on the [[UK Dance Chart]], peaking at number 16. However, it missed the top 100 of the [[UK Singles Chart]] as it only reached number 154. The accompanying [[music video]] was directed by [[Marcus S<U+00F6>derlund]] and plays out in a post-apocalyptic setting.
