| style="text-align: left;" |"I was old enough to catch the television shows that used to be shot on 16 mm film. They were done in studio with strong, direct lighting. The lines were whispered to the actors, who mechanically repeated them. The monsters were always in the dark in order to hide the cheaply made costumes. Their eyes were red lights so that the audience could spot them."

According to Apichatpong Weerasethakul, a man called Boonmee had approached an abbot, Phra Sripariyattiweti, in Weerasethakul's hometown and claimed that he clearly could remember his own previous lives while meditating at a temple. The abbot, who was familiar with the phenomenon, was impressed by Boonmee's ability and decided to publish the book ''A Man Who Can Recall His Past Lives'' in 1983. By the time Weerasethakul got hold of the book the actual Boonmee had already died, but it inspired him to write a screenplay with a similar content and structure. The actual stories in the film were however the director's own inventions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kwai|first=Wise|date=2010-04-20|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/04/20/life/The-late-great-Apichatpong-30127420.html|title=The late, great Apichatpong|work=[[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]]|accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref><ref name=presskit>{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/assets/Image/Direct/033783.pdf|title=English press kit Lung Boonmee raluek chat|publisher=Illuminations films|accessdate=2010-05-20}}</ref> Both the stories and production designs were also inspired by old television shows and Thai comic books, typically with simple plots and supernatural elements.<ref name=presskit />

The film was an international co-production between the director's Thai company Kick the Machine, Britain's Illuminations Films, France's Anna Sanders Films, Germany's The Match Factory and Geissend<U+00F6>rfer Film- und Fernsehproduktion and Spain's Eddie Saeta.<ref name=variety>{{cite web|last=Mayorga|first=Emilio|date=2010-01-20|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118014032.html?categoryid=1442&cs=1|title=Eddie Saeta joins 'Uncle Boonmee'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=2010-04-19}}</ref> It received 3.5 million [[Thai baht|Baht]] in support from the Thai Ministry of Culture.<ref name=multipleavatars>{{cite web|last=Rithdee|first=Kong|date=2010-05-07|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/entertainment/movie/36955/multiple-avatars|title=Multiple avatars|work=[[Bangkok Post]]|accessdate=2010-05-07}}</ref>

Filming took place between October 2009 and February 2010, whenever the weather conditions allowed, in [[Bangkok]] and the region [[Isan]].<ref name=variety /> 16 mm film was used for budget reasons and preferred over digital video in order to give the film a look more similar to classic Thai cinema.<ref name=multipleavatars />

==Release==
The film premiered in competition at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] on 21 May 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/assets/File/Web/HORAIRES%202010/Horaire%20Projections.pdf|title=The screenings guide|work=festival-cannes.com|publisher=[[Cannes Film Festival]]|accessdate=2010-05-20}}</ref> Theatrical distribution in Thailand is uncertain. "Every time I release a movie I lose money because of the advertising and promotion, so I'm not sure if it's worth it, even though I would love to show it at home", Weerasethakul said in an interview.<ref>{{cite web|last=Landreth|first=Jonathan|date=2010-05-18|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film-festival/cannes/news/e3i6478fc41cf5464a58271fa09dff6357e|title=Q&A: Apichatpong Weerasethakul|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=2010-05-20}}</ref>

==Reception==
Sukhdev Sandhu of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' gave the film a perfect score of five stars in an early festival review. Sandhu wrote: "It<U+2019>s barely a film; more a floating world. To watch it is to feel many things <U+2013> balmed, seduced, amused, mystified", and continued: "There are many elements of this film that remain elusive and secretive. But that<U+2019>s a large part of its appeal: Weerasethakul, without ever trading in stock images of Oriental inscrutability, successfully conveys the subtle but important other-worldliness of this part of Thailand".<ref>{{cite web|last=Sandhu|first=Sukhdev|date=2010-05-21|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/cannes-film-festival/7750613/Cannes-Film-Festival-2010-Uncle-Boonmee-Who-Can-Recall-His-Past-Lives-review.html|title=Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, review|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=2010-05-21}}</ref> In ''[[Screen International|Screen]]'', Mark Adams called the film "a beautifully assembled affair, with certain scenes staged with painterly composure, and also increasingly moving as the subtle story develops. Plus Apichatpong Weerasethakul is not afraid of adding in moments of surreal humour <U+2013> often laugh-out-loud moments for that <U+2013> which helps the pacing of the film."<ref>{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Mark|date=2010-05-21|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/latest-reviews/uncle-boonmee-who-can-recall-his-past-lives/5014254.article|title=Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives|work=[[Screen International|Screen]]|accessdate=2010-05-21}}</ref>
