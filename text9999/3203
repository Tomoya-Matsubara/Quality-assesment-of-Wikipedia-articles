'''Karamana''' is a suburb of [[Thiruvananthapuram]], the capital city of [[Kerala]], [[India]]. It is one of the most densely populated, but green part of [[Trivandrum]]. The land of Karamana is made fertile by its own river, [[Karamana River]] which starts from the southern tip of the [[Western Ghats]] at "[[Agastyakoodam]]". The river flows 68 km westward and merges into the [[Arabian Sea]] at Thiruvallom-Karumam area near [[Kovalam]]. Karamana is also known for its busy "Daily market"(a Farmers/Produce market)and is a major transit point for both trade and people travelling to or coming in from the [[Kanyakumari]] district of neighbouring [[Tamil Nadu]].

==Etimology==
According to myths, 'Karamana' the place name came from a famous namboothiri(vaishnavite brahmin) family who lived in the bank of the river. The life of people at that time was sticking around the brahmin family. So, simply referring as the 'mana', meaning house on 'kara' meaning bank, became "karamana". In the flow of time, this family extincted and still the name is there. ''Authenticity of this data is still not confirmed.''

==Antiquity data==

Karamana has been referred in various historic literature works, especially in the period detective novel Dharma Raja, written by Sri C.V. Raman Pillai.

It has one of the oldest [[Brahmin]] settlements of Thiruvananthapuram and the old "Theruvu" style of wall-sharing town-houses, gives one a peek into the Brahmin life-style of yore. It maintains a large community of various religions and castes. Karamana is a model for secularism and religious/cultural tolerance.
