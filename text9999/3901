The '''Brazilian Top Team''' (BTT) is a [[mixed martial arts]] academy specializing in [[Brazilian Jiu Jitsu]] and [[boxing]].
The academy was established in April 2000 by [[Murilo Bustamante]], [[Ricardo Lib<U+00F3>rio]], [[Mario Sperry|M<U+00E1>rio Sperry]] and [[Luis Roberto Duarte]], former-members of the [[Carlson Gracie]] Academy, to develop and create new training techniques for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, [[submission wrestling]] and mixed martial arts.

In April 2002 BTT inaugurated a new center for training professional fighters in mixed martial arts. In the new center the athletes are able to count on professors of: [[muay thai]], [[boxing]], [[wrestling]] and the already recognized skills of its professors of mixed martial arts and [[jiu-jitsu]].

BTT maintains an intense rivalry with Brazilian mixed martial arts stable [[Chute Boxe]], which is descended from a [[Muay Thai]] lineage.  BTT traces its lineage to the [[Brazilian Jiu Jitsu]] of [[Carlson Gracie]].
