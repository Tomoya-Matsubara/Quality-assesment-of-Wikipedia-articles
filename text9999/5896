The '''Lexus LS''' is a [[full-size car|full-size]] [[luxury vehicle|luxury]] [[Sedan (car)|sedan]] that serves as the [[Flagship car|flagship]] model of [[Lexus]], the luxury [[division (business)|division]] of [[Toyota]]. Four generations of the sedan have been produced, all equipped with [[V8]] engines and [[rear-wheel drive]]. Since 2006, [[all-wheel drive]], [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]], and long [[wheelbase]] variants have also been offered. The original Lexus LS 400, the first Lexus to be developed, was introduced as the luxury marque's debut model in 1989. Following the initial model, subsequent redesigns included the second generation LS 400 in 1995, LS 430 in 2001, and the LS 460 / LS 460 L series in 2006. A domestic market version of the LS 400 and LS 430, badged the '''Toyota Celsior''', was sold in [[Japan]] until the Lexus marque was introduced to the country in 2006. For the 2007 model year, the LS 460 debuted the first production eight-speed [[automatic transmission]] and an [[Advanced Parking Guidance System|automatic parking]] system. In 2007, V8 hybrid powertrains were introduced on the LS 600h / LS 600h L variants of the fourth generation sedan.

The Lexus LS began development in 1983 as the [[Lexus LS#First generation .28UCF10.29|F1]] project, the [[code name]] for a secret flagship sedan effort. Following an extended five-year design process at a cost of over [[US$]]1 billion, the resulting sedan premiered with a new V8 engine and multiple luxury features. The Lexus LS was intended for [[export]] markets from its inception, and the Lexus division was formed to market and service the vehicle internationally. The original LS 400 debuted to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque. Each successive iteration of the vehicle has ranked as the best-selling flagship luxury sedan in the [[United States]].

Since the start of production, each generation of the Lexus LS has been produced in the city of [[Tahara, Aichi]], in Japan. In U.S. consumer publications, Lexus' flagship model is recognized as one of the most reliable vehicles ever built, having held the top ranking in [[J.D. Power and Associates]]' U.S. [[Vehicle Dependability Survey]] for fifteen consecutive years, and receiving ''[[Consumer Reports]]''' highest rankings for vehicle dependability.

In December 1989, shortly after the LS 400's launch, Lexus ordered a voluntary recall of the 8,000 vehicles sold so far, based upon two customer complaints over defective [[wiring]] and an overheated [[brake light]]; all vehicles were serviced within 20 days, and the incident helped establish Lexus' [[customer service]] reputation.<ref name=newkid/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060816.wwh-satisfaction0817/BNStory/specialGlobeAuto|title= Brand defined itself by reliable quality|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=2009-02-19|last=Cato|first=Jeremy|date=2006-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060327/SUB/60322012/1003|title=How a recall earned Lexus a top reputation |work=[[Automotive News]]|accessdate=2009-02-19|last=Denove|first=Chris|date=2006-03-27|coauthor=Power, James}}</ref> By 1990, U.S. sales of the LS 400 had surpassed those of competing [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[BMW]], and [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] models.<ref name=whytoyota>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1990/11/19/74363/index.htm|title=Why Toyota keeps getting better and better and better |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|accessdate=2009-02-19|date= 1990-11-19|last=Taylor|first=Alex}}</ref> Adding incentive for early U.S. sales was a base price of US$35,000, which undercut competitors by thousands of dollars.<ref>Dawson 2004, p. 19.</ref> Production of the first generation LS 400 totaled over 165,000 units.<ref name=LSspecs>{{cite web|url=http://www.lexus.com/contact/model_specifications_pricing_ls.html|title=Lexus Knowledge Center - LS Model Specifications|type=PDF|publisher=Lexus|accessdate=2009-04-13}}</ref> Years after its introduction, the LS 400 remained a reliable choice for a [[used car]], making ''Consumer Reports''' 2007 list of recommended vehicles which regularly last {{convert|320000|km|abbr=on}} or more with proper maintenance.<ref>Consumer Union (2007-10).

Given the first generation model's successful reception and high levels of customer satisfaction with its design, replicating the original LS 400's attributes with its successor was one of chief engineer Kazuo Okamoto's primary goals (stating that "a tradition cannot be founded if you reject the first generation").<ref name=Dawson149/> Externally, the most significant change was a increase in wheelbase length of {{convert|36|mm|abbr=on}}, resulting in more interior space and an additional {{convert|66|mm|abbr=on}} of rear seat legroom.<ref name=improving/> However, as the overall length remained the same, [[trunk (automobile)|trunk]] capacity was slightly reduced.<ref name=improving/> The more aerodynamic body (''C''<sub>''d''</sub> 0.28) retained the general profile and contours of the original LS 400,<ref name=comfortable/><ref name=Dawson149>Dawson 2004, pp. 149<U+2013>50.</ref> and was the work of the [[Calty Design Research]] center in the U.S.<ref name=Dawson149/> Designers had evaluated 20 competing concepts, including several with a radically changed body,<ref name=Dawson149/> before selecting a winning entry which included similar forms and contours as the original LS 400.<ref name=Dawson149/> An evolutionary redesign was the ultimate result, with new design features consisting of sharper angles, curved body lines, and a beveled grille.<ref name=long85>Long 2001, p. 85.</ref> More prominent side lines provided a reference point for parking maneuvers, and improved forward visibility.<ref name=long85/>

=== UCF30 (2000) ===
The third generation Lexus LS 430 (UCF30) debuted at the North American International Auto Show in January 2000 as a 2001 model, introducing a new body design and a host of new interior and technological features. The sedan was equipped with a new 4.3&nbsp;liter ''[[Toyota UZ engine#3UZ-FE|3UZ-FE]]'' engine generating {{convert|216|kW}} and {{convert|434|Nm|ftlbf}} of torque.<ref name=comfortable/> The standard suspension had been completely redesigned, with a double-wishbone setup at all four wheels, and a Euro-tuned suspension was offered for the first time.<ref name=comfortable/> A new [[torque]]-activated electronic control unit made [[throttle]] adjustments based on vehicle speed, engine [[revolutions per minute]], and pedal position.<ref name=LS430ca>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiandriver.com/2002/07/05/test-drive-2002-lexus-ls430.htm|title=CanadianDriver <U+00BB> Lexus <U+00BB> Test Drive: 2002 Lexus LS430|work=Canadian Driver|accessdate=2009-02-15|last=Yoxon|first=Grant|date=2002-07-05|quote=0-60: 6.3 sec.}}</ref> The LS 430 sported a 0<U+2013>{{convert|100|km/h|mph}} acceleration time of 6.7&nbsp;seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoevolution.com/engine/lexus-ls-2000-430.html|title=Lexus LS 430 2000 - 2003 specifications|publisher=Autoevolution.com|accessdate=2009-06-05|date=2009}}</ref> Sales began in October 2000 in the U.S.<ref name=edls430/>

Heading into the planning of the LS 430, division executives concluded that the previous LS redesign had been too restrained in its approach.<ref name=Dawson149/> The LS 430 development team, led by chief engineer Yasushi Tanaka, accordingly opted for a more thorough exterior, interior, and technological redevelopment. Selected from 16 different prototype designs, the resulting vehicle saw the sedan's dimensions increase in terms of wheelbase and height.<ref name=LS430ca/><ref name=dawson176>Dawson 2004, pp. 176<U+2013>77.</ref> The exterior featured a larger grille with rounded edges, [[Quarter glass|quarter windows]] on the rear doors, and rounded [[trapezoid]]al headlamps.
