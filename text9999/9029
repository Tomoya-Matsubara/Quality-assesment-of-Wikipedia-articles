'''Alibey Lagoon''' ({{lang-uk|<U+0410><U+043B><U+0456><U+0431><U+0435><U+0439>}}, {{lang-ro|Limanul Alibei}}, {{lang-tr|Alibey G<U+00F6>l<U+00FC>}}) is a salty [[lagoon]] ([[liman (landform)|liman]]) on the [[Black Sea]] coast of [[Tatarbunary Raion]] of [[Odessa Oblast]], [[Ukraine]]. The [[lagoon]] is originated from the old mouth of the [[Khadzhider River]]. The length of the lagoon is 15 km, width 11 km, area 72 km<U+00B2>. The depth is 2.5 m.

The [[lagoon]] is separated from the sea by [[sandbar]]. It is connected through the [[Kurudiol Lagoon]] with the [[Burnas Lagoon]] on the south east, with the [[Karachaus Lagoon]] and [[Shagany Lagoon]] on the south west. Earlier, the [[Khadzhider River]] inflowed to the [[lagoon]], but now the river inflows to the [[Khadzhiber Lagoon]], which separated from the '''Alibey''' by [[dam]].
