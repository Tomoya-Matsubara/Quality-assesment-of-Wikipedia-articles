'''USS ''Blueback'' (SS-326)''', a [[Balao class submarine|''Balao''-class submarine]], was the first submarine of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for a type of [[salmon]].  Her keel was laid down on [[29 July]] [[1943]] by the [[General Dynamics Electric Boat|Electric Boat Company]] of [[Groton, Connecticut]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on [[7 May]] [[1944]] sponsored by Mrs. William Brent Young, wife of Rear Admiral Young, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on [[28 August]] [[1944]] with Lieutenant Commander M. K. Clementson in command.

''Blueback'' arrived at [[Pearl Harbor]] on [[21 November]] [[1944]]. During the period from [[16 December]] [[1944]] to [[20 July]] [[1945]] she completed three war patrols in the [[South China Sea]] and [[Java Sea]]. She sank a 300-ton submarine chaser, as well as eight smaller vessels. She arrived at [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]], [[Luzon]], [[Philippines]], from her third and last war patrol on [[20 July]] [[1945]].

On [[4 September]] [[1945]] ''Blueback'' arrived at [[Apra Harbor]], [[Guam]], where she remained until [[28 November]], conducting daily underway training exercises. After a voyage to the [[Caroline Islands]] and the [[Admiralty Islands]], she returned to [[Guam]] on [[15 December]]. She stood out for [[San Diego, California]], on [[12 January]] [[1946]]. Remaining on the west coast until [[26 August]] [[1946]], she then departed for a tour of the Far East. She visited [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Truk]], [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]], [[Qingdao|Tsingtao]] and [[Shanghai]], [[China]], before returning to San Diego on [[29 November]]. ''Blueback'' conducted one more cruise to Pearl Harbor from [[17 February]] to [[4 April]] [[1947]] and then carried out local operations and type training along the coast of [[California]] until March 1948.

On [[4 March]] [[1948]] ''Blueback'' departed the West Coast and proceeded to the [[Mediterranean Sea]], via [[New London, Connecticut]]. She arrived at [[<U+0130>zmir]], [[Turkey]], on [[11 May]] [[1948]] and on [[23 May]] [[1948]] was decommissioned and transferred to [[Turkey]]. She was renamed '''TCG 2. ''In<U+00F6>n<U+00FC>'' (S 331)''', the first submarine of three pairs named by the [[Turkish Navy]] after the [[Second Battle of <U+0130>n<U+00F6>n<U+00FC>]] during the [[Turkish Independence War]].

''Blueback'' received two [[battle star]]s for her [[World War II]] service.
