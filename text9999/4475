Both novel and movie are based on the real story of [[Herbert Norkus]]' life. Norkus, a [[Hitler Youth]] member, died from injuries suffered when chased and confronted by [[Communism|Communist]] youths in the night of 23 / 24 January 1932 in the Beusselkietz neighborhood of [[Moabit]], [[Berlin]].<ref name=Baird114115>Baird (1992), pp. 114-115</ref> Already the next morning, [[Joseph Goebbels]] started to use Norkus' death for propaganda purposes, during a rally in Berlin's ''Sportpalast''.<ref name=Baird116>Baird (1992), p. 116</ref> The funeral on 29 January at [[Pl<U+00F6>tzensee]], Berlin, was turned into a major ceremony of several Nazi party organizations, under the aegis of Goebbels.<ref name=Baird116/> While the murder was condemned also by non-Nazi press, the Communists started a counter-propaganda offensive, describing the incident as an accidental result of Communist self-defence during a Nazi attack.<ref name=Baird117>Baird (1992), p. 117</ref> In the subsequent trial, several persons were sentenced by the ''Landgericht I'' court in  Moabit, yet the most prominent accomplices Willi Simon, Bernhard Klingbeil and Harry Tack had been able to escape to the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=Baird116/>

After the Nazis [[Machtergreifung|assumed power]], the grave of Norkus was turned into a "Nazi shrine", visited annually on New Years' Day by Nazi youth leader [[Baldur von Schirach]] for a speech that was broadcast nationwide.<ref name=Baird118>Baird (1992), p. 118</ref> To the site of Norkus' death at Zwinglistra<U+00DF>e 4,<ref name=Baird115>Baird (1992), p. 115</ref> a plaque was attached reading "''He Gave His Life For Germany's Freedom''", the first of several such memorial plaques subsequently placed throughout Germany.<ref name=Baird118/> 24 January was made remembrance day for all killed Hitler Youths, and the flag of Norkus' unit became the Hitler Youth's "[[blood flag]]".<ref name=Baird118/> Two weeks after the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], a provocative Hitler Youth march to Norkus' grave took the route through Berlin's communist districts of [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]] and [[Moabit]].<ref name=Baird118/> Throughout Germany, the Nazis organized demonstrations and speeches commemorating their newly created martyr.<ref name=Rentschler55/> Novels, plays, poems and songs were written about him.<ref name=Rentschler55/>

==The novel==
The novel ''Der Hitlerjunge Quex'' was written by [[Karl Aloys Schenzinger]] between May and September 1932.<ref name=Rentschler55/> It was first published in [[Nazi party]] outlet ''[[V<U+00F6>lkischer Beobachter]]'', and as a book in December 1932.<ref name=Rentschler55/> A required reading for [[Hitler Youth]] members,<ref name=Rentschler55/> more than 190,000 copies were sold within the first two years,<ref name=Baird119>Baird (1992), p. 119</ref> and more than 500,000 copies until 1945.<ref name=Rentschler55/>

In Schenzinger's novel, [[Herbert Norkus]] is named ''Heini V<U+00F6>lker''.<ref name=Baird119/> With a ''[[v<U+00F6>lkisch]]'' undertone, the opening chapters describe the hardships of Norkus' youth in a working class neighborhood of [[Berlin]], characterized by the [[Great Depression]], the unemployment of his father and the suicide of his mother.<ref name=Baird119/> The contemporary [[Communism|communist]] youth (''[[Rotfrontk<U+00E4>mpferbund|Rote Jungfront]]'', "Red Young Front") is portrayed as a disorderly gang devoted primarily to alcohol, tobacco and sex.<ref name=Baird119/> In contrast, the [[Nazi party|Nazi]] youth (''[[Hitler Youth|Hitlerjugend]]'', "Hitler Youth") is portrayed as an orderly organization, superior in morals.<ref name=Baird119/> Schenzinger lets Heini V<U+00F6>lker's father force his son to attend a camping weekend organized by a communist youth group, North Star Moabit. Heini is disgusted and flees the camp, only to encounter a Hitler Youth goup in the woods.<ref name=Baird119/> Deeply impressed, and in an athmosphere of nationalistic pathos, Heini learns of the [[Nazism|Nazi movement]], ''[[F<U+00FC>hrerprinzip]]'' ("leader principle"), comradeship and ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' ("the people's community").<ref name=Baird119/> On "the happiest day of his life", Heini joins the Hitler Youth, and Schenzinger has the [[Bannf<U+00FC>hrer]] (group leader) symbolize Nazi ideology when he handed over Heini's uniform to him: "''[The uniform] is the clothing of the community, of comradeship, of our ideology, of our unified organization! [...] It makes us all equal, and gives the same to all and demands the same from all. He who wears such a uniform doesn't have desires of his own anymore, he has only to obey.''"<ref name=Baird120>Baird (1992), p. 120</ref>

The following chapters deal with Heini's life as a Hitler Youth.<ref name=Baird120/> Obedience and equality [[Gleichschaltung|as understood by the Nazis]] are portrayed in a very positive light.<ref name=Baird120/> They turn out to be beneficial not only for Heini, but also for his comrades, for example, his best friend ''Fritz D<U+00F6>rries'', the son of a wealthy merchant.<ref name=Baird120/> Emphasis is put on the vision of self-sacrifice, the abolition of social barriers and racial purity, and Heini learns from Fritz that "''with us Hitler Youth, there are no classes. There are only those who get the job done and parasites, and those we'll throw out.''"<ref name=Baird120/> The haven Heini found in the Hitler Youth is symbolized by his group's hang-out, "Castle Beusselkietz"<ref name=Baird121>Baird (1992), p. 121</ref> - Norkus' group was ''Schar 2, Hitlerjugend Beusselkietz-Hansa''.<ref name=Baird118>Baird (1992), p. 118</ref> His comrades nicknamed him ''Quex'' because "he carried out orders faster than [[quicksilver]]" ({{lang-de|Quecksilber}}).<ref name=Baird120/>

The last part of the novel is devoted to the circumstances of Norkus' (or Heini V<U+00F6>lker's) death.<ref name=Baird121/> According to Baird (1992), Schenzinger's version is a "thinly veiled parallel to Resurrection":<ref name=Baird121/> When his comrades were gathered around his death bed and wonder whether he is still alive, there "''suddenly [...] is a scream. Heini is sitting up in bed, his eyes wide open. He is singing. They don't recognize the words, but they know the melody. It's the song they sing every day, every evening together, on every march. Everyone knows what it means - death is singing here.''"<ref name=Baird121/>
