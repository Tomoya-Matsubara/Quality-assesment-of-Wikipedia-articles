The '''Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations''' (SHAFR) is the leading [[learned society]] for the academic study of [[United States]] [[foreign policy]] history. 

Founded in 1967, SHAFR is best known for two activities. First, the society's journal, ''Diplomatic History'', is generally regarded as the most prestigious journal in its field. Secondly, the society holds an annual conference each June. It generally alternates between [[Washington, D.C.]] and various other North American towns and cities with major universities. Recent hosts have included The [[University of Kansas]] (2006), [[The University of Texas at Austin]] (2004) and the [[University of Georgia]] (2002).
