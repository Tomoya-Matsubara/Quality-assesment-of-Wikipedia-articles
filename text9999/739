The '''A<U+00E9>rospatiale Alouette III''' ({{IPA-fr|alw<U+025B>t}}, ''[[Lark]]'') is a single-engine, light utility [[helicopter]] developed by [[Sud Aviation]]. It was manufactured by [[A<U+00E9>rospatiale]] of [[France]], and under licence by [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited]] in [[India]] as Hal Chetak and [[Industria Aeronautic<U+0103> Rom<U+00E2>n<U+0103>]] in [[Romania]].

The Alouette III is the successor to the [[A<U+00E9>rospatiale Alouette II|Alouette II]], being larger and having more seating

==Development==
The first version of the Alouette III, the SE 3160 prototype, first flew on 28 February 1959. Production of the SA 316A (SE 3160) began in 1961 and remained in production until 1968, when it was replaced by the SA 316B. The last and 1437th Alouette III left the Marignane assembly lines in 1979, when the main production line in France was closed down. The last Alouette III from A<U+00E9>rospatiale was delivered in 1985.

Over 500 units were manufactured under licence in Romania, India and Switzerland. [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited]] (HAL) obtained a licence to build Alouette IIIs as the '''HAL Chetak''' in India. Over 300 units were produced by HAL as it continued to independently update and indigenize the helicopter over the years, and a variant is still in production though in diminishing volumes. Versions of the Alouette III were also either licence-built or assembled by IAR in Romania (as the [[IAR 316]]), F+W Emmen in Switzerland, and by [[Fokker]] and Lichtwerk in the [[Netherlands]].

Production numbers are as follows:
*France: 1453
*India: 300+ (Still in production)
*Romania: 200+
*Switzerland: 60

==Operational history==
===Argentina===
The [[Argentine Naval Aviation]] purchased 14 helicopters. One SA316B was on board the ''[[ARA General Belgrano]]'' when she was sunk by the ''[[HMS Conqueror|HMS Conqueror's]]'' [[torpedoes]] during the [[Falklands War]] with Great Britain in 1982 and a second one played an important role during the [[Invasion of South Georgia]]. On 2 December 2010, the last example was retired at a ceremony held at BAN Comandante Espora, [[Bah<U+00ED>a Blanca]].<ref>[http://www.gacetamarinera.com.ar/nota.asp?idNota=2531&idSec=7 Adi<U+00F3>s Alouette]</ref><ref name="AFM275">{{cite journal|date=March 2011|title=Argentine Navy's Final Alouette III Retired|journal=Air Forces Monthly|publisher=Key Publishing Ltd|issue= 275|page=page 24|issn=09557091|accessdate=15 April 2011}}</ref>

===Australia===
From April 1964 to 1967, three machines were delivered from France for local assembly in [[Australia]], and were used by [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) at the [[Woomera Test Range|Woomera]] Rocket Range for light passenger transport and recovery of missile parts after test launches at the Range.

===Denmark===
Eight machines were delivered to the [[Royal Danish Navy]] from 1962 to 1967. They were primarily tasked with SAR and reconnaissance in support of the navy's Arctic patrol ships. In 1982 they were replaced by the [[Westland Lynx]]
===France===
[[File:Alouette Motte Piquet.jpg|thumb|French Navy ''Alouette III'' on the [[frigate]] ''[[Georges Leygues class frigate|La Motte-Picquet]]'']]

The Alouette III entered in service with the French Armed forces in 1960, the French Army ordered 50 Alouette IIIs in June 1961. 

In June 1960, an Alouette III carrying seven people made take-offs and landings on [[Mont Blanc]] in the [[French Alps]] at an altitude of 4,810 meters (15,780 feet), an unprecedented altitude for such activities by a helicopter.<ref name="Donald, p. 22">Donald, p. 22.</ref> The same helicopter again demonstrated the type{{'}}s extraordinary performance in November 1960 by making take-offs and landings with a crew of two and a [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] of 250&nbsp;kg (551&nbsp;lbs) in the [[Himalayas]] at an altitude of 6,004 meters (19,698 feet).<ref name="Donald, p. 22"/> 

In June 2004, the Alouette III was retired from the French Air Force after 32 years of successful service, being replaced by the [[Eurocopter AS355|Eurocopter EC 355 Ecureuil 2]].

The French Navy still uses the Alouette III for Search and Rescue and Logistics missions.

===Ireland===
At Baldonnel on 21 September 2007 the Alouette III was retired from the [[Irish Air Corps]]. During 44 years of successful service, the Irish Alouette III fleet amassed over 77,000 flying hours. As well as routine military missions, the aircraft undertook some 1,717 [[search-and-rescue]] missions, saving 542 lives and flew a further 2,882 [[air ambulance]] flights. The oldest of the Alouettes, 195, is kept in 'rotors running' condition for the Air Corps Museum.<ref>[http://www.airsceneuk.org.uk/hangar/2008/475iac/iac.htm New Wings for the Irish Air Corps]</ref>

===India===
[[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited]] built over 300 units of the helicopter under licence as the '''HAL Chetak'''. They were primarily in service with the [[Indian Armed Forces]] in training, transport, CASEVAC (Casualty Evacuation), communications and liaison roles. The Chetak is being replaced by [[HAL Dhruv]] in the armed forces. An option to re-engine the HAL Chetak with the Turbomeca TM 333-2B engine for high-altitude operations in the Himalayas was considered, but not pursued.

In 1986 the Government constituted the Army's Aviation Corps and most Chetak operating in AOP Squadrons were transferred from the Air Force on 1 November 1986. The Air Force continues to fly armed Chetaks in the anti-tank role as well as for CASEVAC and general duties.

HAL also exported Chetak helicopters to [[Namibia]] and [[Suriname]]. India has also donated used Chetak helicopters to other countries such as [[Bangladesh]] and [[Nepal]].
In 2012 October 15, One chetak helicopter of Indian Navy carrying 3 navy personal, flying from Mumbai to HAL Bangalore for technical inspection, crash landed in Dabolim airport,Goa at 9.50 am(just 5 minutes before landing) into the main runway, where it was supposed to be landed for refueling and killed all three on board.Lt Harish Krishnan, Chief Air artificer,Lt Commander Dharmendra Singh, Lt Rahul Tiwari died on the spot. .The rotor of the Chetak aircraft broke off when it was 300 feet above the runway and the chopper came crashing down. The aircraft fell just 50 metres away from the runway, which is also being used by the civilian flights. Dabolim airport is inside INS Hansa, a naval base which is a home for various flying squadrons.The chopper was flying between Mumbai and Bangalore and was landing at Goa airport for scheduled refuelling halt at 09:50 am, when the accident happened.

===Pakistan===
Pakistan purchased 35 Alouette III helicopters and used them in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], mainly for liaison and VIP-transport. Two Alouette IIIs of the [[Pakistan Air Force]] (PAF) were shot down during the war.<ref name=br>http://bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1971War/Appendix3.html</ref>

===Portugal===
[[File:AssaltonaMatadaSanga....jpg|thumb|Portuguese Air Force's helicopter operating in the African theatre during the war.]]

The Alouette III saw service in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]], during 1960s and 1970s with large utilization in [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]], [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], and [[Portuguese Guinea]], where it proved its qualities.

===Rhodesia===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
The Alouette III was originally purchased by the Rhodesians pre UDI. Later a large number of Alouette IIIs were covertly obtained from various sources to increase the capability of No. 7 Squadron and also to replenish the squadron for various losses suffered both by accidents and while on combat missions.

In the 1970s [[South African Air Force]] (SAAF) Alouette III helicopters were attached to No. 7 Squadron, [[Rhodesian Air Force]]. The Alouette III was also the choice of the South African Air Force which meant that training facilities and expertise could be shared. The Portuguese Air Force had also purchased Alouette IIIs.

For [[Fireforce]] missions a gunship version of the Alouette III was fitted with a Matra [[MG 151/20]] 20&nbsp;mm cannon. The 'K-Car', as it was known, was operated usually with a crew of three, (pilot, gunner and fireforce commander). The 'K-Car' was used as a mobile command post to allow the army commander of the heli-borne troops to direct their operations from the air above them.

Ammunition for the 20mm Cannon was carried in a special bin in the left hand baggage compartment and fed to the cannon via a feed tray through the rear bulkhead. The spent brass was collected in a compartment below the cabin floor. The ammunition bin was supposed to be able to carry 440 rounds of 20mm ammuninition, but typically, only 400-410 rounds were loaded. The gunner in the 'K-Car' was also a technician and therefore he was not only the gunner, but also responsible for all the maintenance of his aircraft.

A Rhodesian Alouette III, 'K-Car' had the distinction of shooting down a [[Botswana Defence Force]] [[Britten-Norman Islander|Islander]] on 9 August 1979 with its 20mm cannon.

The standard troop carrying/utility version of the Alouette III in the Rhodesian Air Force were called 'G-Cars'. They were used by No. 7 Squadron for the troop transport, light air/ground fire support, SAR, casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) and a variety of other roles.

Rhodesian practice was to operate the 'G-Car' with a gunner/technician and to mount twin [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Mk 2 .303 Brownings]] machine guns, with about 400 rounds per gun. As with the 'K-Car', not only did the technician fly in combat and operate the aircraft's weapons, he was also responsible for all the maintenance of the helicopter too.

In the troop carrying role, a "Stick" of four soldiers was the standard load for the RhAF Alouette III. The seating configuration was two in the rear of the cabin, beside the gunner/technician and behind the pilot, with the "Stick commander" in the centre and his MAG gunner beside him. The other two riflemen were in the front on the rear-facing bench seat. Experience in combat led the Rhodesians to remove all but the pilot's door on the 'G-Car' and to reverse the front passengers to widen the available floorspace and gain flexibility. With the doors removed, it was easier for the soldiers to leave the helicopter quickly. Reversing the front seats opened up floor area and therefore more space for internal cargo was available. The standard Sud Aviation front seats in the 'G-Car' were replaced in the Rhodesian Air Force by a "home made" rear-facing bench seat. While carrying troops, casualties on a stretcher could be carried laterally across the rear of the cabin, one on the floor and another stretcher on a rack above it.

In September 1974 Rhodesian Air Force Alouette IIIs were fitted with anti-[[Strela 2|STRELA]] shrouds on the engines, the tail pipe was turned up to deflect the hot exhaust gasses into the rotor downwash and they were given matt paint finishes. This was done to reduce the Infra Red signature of the helicopter and proved to be highly successful for the type.

Several Alouettes were brought down by fire from the ground, but considering the intensity of operations, losses were surprisingly low. This was probably due to the highly skilled pilots' tactics of using ultra low level flying and terrain to keep out of the line of enemy fire.

At one stage, 27 SAAF helicopters were deployed in Rhodesia. Within No. 7 Squadron, the SAAF Alouettes were designated as belonging to Alpha Flight.

===South Africa===
The Alouette III helicopter served for 44 years and flew more than 346.000 hours in the South African Air Force (SAAF). The official withdrawal of Alouette III in SAAF took place on 30 June 2006 at Swartkop in Pretoria.<ref>[http://www.saairforce.co.za/news-and-events/586/alouette-iii-final-flight Alouette III final flight]</ref>

The SAAF received 118 Alouette III helicopters between 1962 and the late 1970s. They were used extensively throughout the Bush War.

===Switzerland===
In 2004, the [[Swiss Armed Forces]] announced the retirement of the Alouette III from front-line service by 2006 and entirely by 2010.

===Venezuela===
The [[Venezuelan Air Force]] retired its Alouette IIIs in the late 1990s.
