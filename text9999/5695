'''U.S. Highway 266''' is an east-west [[United States highway]].  It is only 42 miles (68 km) long, lies entirely within the state of [[Oklahoma]], does not meet the former route of its parent, [[U.S. Highway 66]], and is closely paralleled by [[Interstate 40]].

As of [[2004]], the highway's eastern terminus is in [[Warner, Oklahoma]] at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 64]], [[duplex (road)|duplex]]ed with [[State Highway 2 (Oklahoma)|Oklahoma State Highway 2]]. Its western terminus is in [[Henryetta, Oklahoma]] at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 75]] and [[U.S. Route 62]].

==Historic termini==
In the original [[1926]] plan, US 266 extended to [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]] to meet its parent route, [[U.S. Highway 66]].  But by [[1931]], along with changes to several other branches of US 66 [http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us666.htm], the route was truncated at Henryetta.  The segment from Oklahoma City to Henryetta became part of [[U.S. Highway 62]], which was commissioned in [[1930]].

==States traversed==
The highway passes through the following states:
* [[Oklahoma]]
