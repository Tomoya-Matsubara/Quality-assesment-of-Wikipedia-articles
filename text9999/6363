'''Nursing ethics''' is a branch of [[applied ethics]] that concerns itself with activities in the field of [[nursing]]. Nursing ethics shares many principles with [[medical ethics]], such as [[beneficence]], [[Primum non nocere|non-maleficence]] and respect for [[autonomy]]. It can be distinguished by its emphasis on relationships, maintaining [[dignity]] and collaborative care.

==Development of subject==
The nature of nursing means that nursing ethics tends to examine the ethics of caring rather than 'curing' by exploring the relationship between the nurse and the person in care.<ref name="REP">{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=Geoffrey|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor=Craig E|publisher=Routledge|location=London|date=1998|volume=7|pages=56<U+2013>57|isbn=9780415187121}}</ref> Early attempts to define ethics in nursing focused more on the [[virtue ethics|virtues]] that would make a good nurse, rather than looking at what conduct is necessary to respect the human rights of the person in the nurse's care. However, in the modern era, the ethics of nursing has shifted more towards the nurse's obligation to respect these rights and this is reflected in a number of professional codes for nurses.<ref>{{cite book| author=McHale, J & Gallagher, A|title=Nursing and Human Rights|publisher=Butterworth Heinemann| year=2003|isbn=0-7506-5292-6}}</ref> For example, the importance of respecting human rights in nursing is made explicit in the latest code from the [[International Council of Nurses]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icn.ch/icncode.pdf|title=The ICN Code of Ethics for Nurses|date=2006|publisher=International Council of Nurses|accessdate=2009-06-27}}</ref>

==Distinctive nature==
Although much of nursing ethics can often appear similar to [[medical ethics]], there are some factors that differentiate it. The focus of nursing ethics is on developing a caring relationship<ref name="Tschudin">{{cite book|last=Tschudin|first=Verena|title=Ethics in Nursing: the caring relationship|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Edinburgh|date=2003|edition=3rd|isbn=9780750652650}}</ref> and this produces some differences. For example, a well established principle of traditional medical ethics is [[beneficence]]. Whereas, traditional medical ethics allows this to be expressed through [[paternalism]], this approach would not be compatible with nursing ethics.<ref name="Rumbold 1999">{{cite book| author=Rumbold, G|title=Ethics in Nursing Practice|publisher=Balliere Tindall| year=1999|isbn=0-7020-2312-4}}</ref> This is because [[nursing theory]] seeks a collaborative relationship with the person in care. Themes that emphasizes respect for the [[autonomy]] and maintaining the dignity of the [[patient]] by promoting choice and control over their environment are commonly seen. This is in contrast to paternalistic practice where the health professional chooses what is in the best interests of the person from a perspective of wishing to cure them.

The distinction can be examined from a different angle. Despite the move toward more [[deontological]] themes by some, there continues to be an interest in [[virtue ethics]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Alan|title=Nursing Ethics: A Virtue-Based Approach|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|date=2007|isbn=9780230506886}}</ref> in nursing ethics and some support for an [[ethic of care]].<ref name="Tschudin"/> This is considered by its advocates to focus more on relationships than principles and therefore to reflect the caring relationship in nursing more accurately than other ethical views.

==Some themes in nursing ethics==

Nursing seeks to defend the dignity of those in their care.<ref name = "RCN">{{cite book|last=Baille L, Gallagher A. & Wainwright P.|title=Defending Dignity|publisher=Royal College of Nursing|date=2008|url=http://www.rcn.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/166655/003257.pdf}}</ref> In terms of mainstream [[ethical theory]], this may be interpreted as having a respect for [[autonomy]]. People are then enabled to make decisions about their own treatment. Amongst other things this grounds the practice of [[informed consent]] that should be respected by the nurse.<ref name="Rumbold 1999"/> Although much of the debate lies in the discussion of cases where people are unable to make choices about their own treatment due to being [[capacity (law)|incapacitated]] or having a [[mental illness]] that affects their judgement. A way to maintain autonomy is for the person to write an [[advance directive]], outlining how they wish to be treated in the event of them not being able to make an informed choice, thus avoiding unwarranted paternalism.

Another theme is [[confidentiality]] and this is an important principle in many nursing ethical codes. This is where information about the person is only shared with others after permission of the person, unless it is felt that the information must be shared to comply with a higher duty such as preserving life. <ref name="Rumbold 1999"/>.

Also related to information giving is the debate relating to  [[honesty|truth telling]] in interactions with the person in care. There is a balance between people having the information required to make an autonomous decision and, on the other hand, not being unnecessarily distressed by the truth. Generally the balance is in favour of truth telling due to respect for autonomy, but sometimes people will ask not to be told, or may lack the capacity to understand the implications. <ref name="Tuckett">{{cite journal|last=Tuckett|first=Anthony|date=2004|title=Truth-Telling in Clinical Practice and the Arguments for and Against: a review of the literature|journal=Nursing Ethics|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|volume=11|issue=5|pages=500<U+2013>513|url=http://nej.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/11/5/500|doi=10.1191/0969733004ne728oa|pmid=15362359}}</ref>

By observing the principles above, the nurse can act in a way that maintains the dignity of the individual in their care. Although this key outcome in nursing practice is sometimes challenged by resource, policy or environmental constraints in the practice area. <ref name = "RCN"/>
