'''Lille''' is a [[List of ghost towns in Alberta|ghost town in Alberta]] located in the [[Crowsnest Pass]] region. It held a significant population between 1901 and 1912. In the latter year, the coal mine and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] ovens were closed due to the collapse of the local industry. The company running the town, West Canadian Collieries, suffered a loss of $40,000.

== History ==
Lille was established as a coal mining town in 1901 by two representatives of a French company, United Gold Fields Ltd. The representatives, J. J. Fleutot and C. Remy, were looking for coal in the [[Crowsnest Pass]] of [[Alberta]] when they happened upon a seam near the future site of Lille. The town was initially called 'French Camp', but the founders of the town changed its name to Lille after the [[Lille|French town of the same name]] where the mining venture's financial backers were located.<ref>{{Cite journal

Lille was built mostly by the company, which was renamed West Canadian Collieries in 1903. Approximately 20 residences existed, along with a doctor, a school room, a hospital and a hotel. The company also rented space for firms to conduct business. Although originally planned for nearby Frank, [[coke (fuel)|coke]] ovens were established in Lille in 1903. In 1912, the local coal mine closed due to the collapse of the local coke industry. West Canadian Collieries suffered a loss of over $40,000, as wages exceeded revenue by that amount.<ref>{{Cite journal

Although Lille is a Provincial Historic Site, much of the town site has fallen prey to scavengers, and as such very little of Lille remains.<ref>{{Cite journal
