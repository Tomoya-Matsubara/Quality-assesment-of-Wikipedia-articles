{{U.S. deficit and debt topics}}

The '''budget sequestration in 2013''' refers to the [[budget sequestration|automatic spending cuts]] to [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal government]] spending in particular categories of outlays{{#tag:ref|This procedure was first used in the [[Gramm<U+2013>Rudman<U+2013>Hollings Balanced Budget Act]] of 1985. The sequesters would take place if the [[federal deficit]] exceeded a set of fixed deficit targets.|group="note"}} that were initially set to begin on January 1, 2013, as an [[austerity]] [[fiscal policy]] as a result of [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] (BCA), and were postponed by two months by the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]] until March 1 when this law went into effect.<ref name="CBO Impact1" />

The reductions in [[United States federal budget#Budget authority versus outlays|spending authority]] are approximately $85.4 billion (versus $42 billion in actual cash outlays{{#tag:ref|The Budget Control Act specifies reductions in budget ''authority'' for the sequester; that is, the amount of new obligations authorized by law. This is not the same as budget ''outlays'', which are the actual cash disbursements.<br />For example, the $85.4 billion represents the FY2013 decrease in budget authority. But some of that money would have been used to enter into contracts to be provided and paid for in subsequent years. The CBO estimated that the reduction in cash disbursements in fiscal year 2013 will be about $42 billion.<ref name="CBO Outlook1" />{{rp|page=31}}<ref name="AutoReduct">{{cite web |title=Automatic Reductions in Government Spending -- aka Sequestration |last=Edelberg |first=Wendy |url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43961 |date=February 28, 2013 |publisher=Congressional Budget Office}}</ref>|group="note"|name="AuthVsOutlay"}}) during [[Fiscal year#United States|fiscal year]] 2013,<ref name="CBO Outlook1" />{{rp|page=14}} with similar cuts for years 2014 through 2021. However, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimated that the total federal outlays will continue to increase even with the sequester by an average of $238.6 billion per year<ref name="CBO Outlook1" />{{rp|page=3}} during the next decade, although at a somewhat lesser rate.

The cuts are split evenly (by dollar amounts, ''not'' by percentages) between the defense and non-defense categories.{{#tag:ref|The non-defense cuts are further split between discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is that part of the federal budget that Congress generally controls through annual [[Appropriation bill#United States|appropriation acts]] or [[continuing resolution]]s including the [[United States federal executive departments|cabinet departments]] and [[Independent agencies of the United States government|federal agencies]]. This is as opposed to mandatory spending: those "self-funded" programs (such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[federal crop insurance]]) that have had their expenditures written into their "enabling acts"; that is, the acts that created them. <br />In 2011, discretionary spending totaled about $1.35 trillion, accounting for close to 40 percent of federal expenditures. Slightly more than half of the discretionary money went for defense. The rest of the discretionary spending funded a wide variety of government programs and activities, including education, veterans' benefits, public health and the administration of justice.<br />The area of sequestration most affected is discretionary spending, which represented, in total, approximately 36% of federal outlays in 2012. The sequester also affects certain mandatory programs, including Medicare. The sequester will reduce 2013 discretionary spending below 2012 levels, while cuts to Medicare will reduce future cost increases.<ref name="CBO Outlook1"/>|name="DiscretDef"|group="note"}} Some major programs like [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], [[Medicaid]], federal pensions and veteran's benefits are exempt. By a special provision in the BCA, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] spending will be reduced by a fixed 2% per year versus the other, domestic percents planned for the sequester.<ref name="CBO Impact1">{{cite web | title=CBO Estimated Impact of Automatic Budget Enforcement Procedures Specified in the Budget Control Act |author=CBO |url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/42754 |date=September 2011 |publisher=CBO |accessdate=February 2013}}</ref> Federal [[General Schedule|pay rates]] (including military) are unaffected but the sequestration did result in involuntary unpaid time off, also known as [[furlough]]s.<ref name="WPostEverything"/>

The sequester lowers spending by a total of approximately $1.1 trillion versus pre-sequester levels over the approximately 8 year period from 2013 to 2021. It lowers non-defense discretionary spending (i.e., certain domestic programs) by a range of 7.8% (in 2013) to 5.5% (in 2021) versus pre-sequester amounts, a total of $294 billion. Defense spending would likewise be lowered by 10% (in 2013) to 8.5% (in 2021), a total of $454 billion. Savings in non-defense mandatory spending would total $170 billion, while interest would be lowered by $169 billion.<ref name="CBO Impact1" /> The CBO estimated that sequestration would reduce 2013 [[GDP|economic growth]] by about 0.6 percentage points (from 2.0% to 1.4% or about $90B) and affect the creation or retention of about 750,000 jobs by year-end.<ref name="CBO Impacts of Sequester1"/> As of May 2013, FY2013 spending ($3.455 trillion) was projected to be lower in an absolute sense than FY2012 spending ($3.537 trillion).<ref>{{cite web|title=CBO's Baseline Budget Projections, as of May 2013, With Percentages of GDP Updated to Reflect Recent Revisions by the Bureau of Economic Analysis|url=http://cbo.gov/publication/44574|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=5 January 2014|date=11 September 2013}}</ref> 

The blunt nature{{#tag:ref|The Budget Control Act says that these reductions must be made by budget account at the program, project and activity level. This is the smallest division that the annual U.S. Budget normally uses. Thus it makes it very difficult to effect which government programs and activities are being cut.<br />For example, the [[Office of Management and Budget|OMB]] says that, according to the BCA, the sequester must reduce the Army Reserve Operation and Maintenance account by $309 million in FY2013 while money for the Afghanistan Security Forces must also be cut by $1,325 million.<ref name="SeqTransAct">{{cite web |title=OMB Report Pursuant to the Sequestration Transparency Act of 2012 |url=http://cdn.govexec.com/media/gbc/docs/pdfs_edit/091412cc1.pdf |date=September 14, 2012 |publisher=[[OMB]] |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref> The administration is therefore ''not'' allowed by law to decrease the cut for Afghanistan by, say, $50 million while increasing the cut for the Army Reserve by an equal $50 million.|name="BudAccs"|group="note"}} of the cuts has been criticized, with some favoring more tailored cuts and others arguing for postponement while the economy improves.<ref name="nytimes.com">[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/22/opinion/krugman-sequester-of-fools.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&_r=0 NYT-Paul Krugman-Sequester of Fools-February 2013]</ref>

== Legislative history ==
On August 2, 2011, [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] signed the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] as part of an agreement with Congress to resolve the [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|debt-ceiling crisis]]. The Act provided for a [[Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction]] (the "super committee") to produce legislation by late November that would decrease the deficit by $1.2 trillion over ten years.  When the super committee failed to act,<ref name="statement20111121">{{cite web| title=Statement from Co-Chairs of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction | url= http://cybercemetery.unt.edu/archive/deficit/20120113174127/http://www.deficitreduction.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ID=fa0e02f6-2cc2-4aa6-b32a-3c7f6155806d |date=November 21, 2011| accessdate= January 30, 2012| publisher=deficitreduction.gov}}</ref> another part of the BCA went into effect. This directed automatic across-the-board cuts (known as "sequestrations") split evenly between defense and domestic spending, beginning on January 2, 2013.

The sequestration became a major topic of the [[fiscal cliff]] debate. The debate's resolution, the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]] (ATRA), eliminated much of the tax side of the dispute but only delayed the budget sequestrations for two months,  thus reducing the original $110 billion to be saved per fiscal year to $85 billion in 2013.<ref name="hook&hughes">{{cite news |last1=Hook |first1= Janet |last2=Hughes|first2=Siobhan|title=Fiscal-Cliff Focus Moves to House|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323320404578215373352793876.html|accessdate=February 25, 2013|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=January 1, 2013}}</ref>

====By Republicans in Congress====
The Republican House had narrowly passed<ref name="WPostEverything"/><ref name="WPost4Plans"/> a bill on December 20, 2012,<ref>{{cite web |title=H.R. 6684 |url=http://www.gop.gov/bill/112/2/hr6684 |date=December 20, 2012 |work=Legislative Digest |publisher=House Republicans |accessdate=March 7, 2013}}</ref> which would have replaced only the defense side of the sequester with cuts to programs including [[food stamps]], [[Dodd-Frank]] and the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]. In February with their reduced majority, key Republicans admitted that they would not be able to pass the bill again, even in the House.<ref name="TPMRepNoPass">{{cite web |title=House Republicans Unlikely To Pass New Sequester Replacement Plan |last=Beutler |first=Brian |url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2013/02/house-republicans-wont-pass-sequester-replacement.php |date=February 11, 2013 |publisher=TPM |accessdate=March 7, 2013}}</ref> Nevertheless, many Republicans believed that the bill would serve as a template for what they wanted: no tax increases, no defense cuts, and considerable domestic spending reductions.<ref name="WPost4Plans"/>

====By Democrats in Congress====
On February 8, Democrat [[Chris Van Hollen]], ranking member of the [[House Budget Committee]], introduced new taxes and reduced spending to fend off the sequestration, including a [[Buffett rule|Buffett-style tax-rule]] on millionaires, a repeal of some oil subsidy loopholes, a reduction in farm subsidy payments and an increase in flood insurance premiums.<ref name="WPostEverything" /><ref name="DemBill-130305">{{cite web |title=Democrats Still Denied a Vote on the "Stop the Sequester Job Loss Now" Act |url=http://democrats.budget.house.gov/fact-sheet/fact-sheet-stop-sequester-job-loss-now-act |date=March 5, 2013 |publisher=House Democrats |accessdate=March 7, 2013}}</ref>

[[Patty Murray]], Democratic Chairwoman of the [[Senate Budget Committee]], proposed on February 14 to replace the 2013 sequester with $110 billion in spending cuts and tax increases. Like the House version, these policies also include a Buffett-rule tax, the closure of the oil subsidies, and cuts to farm subsidies. Additionally, this bill would cut defense spending for 2013 in excess of the amounts required by the current sequester. But this bill has little chance of winning the 60 votes required to override a filibuster.<ref name="WPostDemProp">{{cite news |title=Senate Democrats propose cuts, tax hikes on rich to avoid sequester |last=Montgomery |first=Lori |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/senate-democrats-propose-cuts-tax-hikes-on-rich-to-avoid-sequester/2013/02/14/aa3f5d44-76e2-11e2-95e4-6148e45d7adb_story.html?hpid=z4 |date=February 14, 2013 |publisher=[[Washington Post]] |accessdate=March 7, 2013}}</ref>

Both of these plans are temporary in the sense that they allow much of the sequestration to resume at the end of 2013.

Some public interest groups concerned about the federal budget wanted to stop the sequester, but few offered detail plans (beyond a "balanced approach") for replacing the automatic cuts.  These few included:<ref name="WPostEverything" />
* [[FreedomWorks]] and the [[Conservative Action Project]] said that the sequester should be replaced by defunding [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Obamacare]]; that is, eliminating: the refundable tax credits that form the basis of the federal health exchanges, the Medicare expansion matching funds and the increased funding for the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) and Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF).<ref name="FWObamacare">{{cite web |last=Kibbe |first=Matt |title=Coalition Letter: Congress Must Honor Sequester Savings and Defund ObamaCare Before It Is Too Late |url=http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/ryanriebe/joint-letter-on-sequester-savings |date=February 14, 2013 |publisher=[[FreedomWorks]] |accessdate=March 10, 2013}}</ref>

==CBO projections==

===Overview===
The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimated in September 2011 that the sequester would have the following effects between 2013 and 2021:
*"Reductions ranging from 10.0 percent (in 2013) to 8.5 percent (in 2021) in the caps on new discretionary appropriations for defense programs, yielding total outlay savings of $454 billion."
*"Reductions ranging from 7.8 percent (in 2013) to 5.5 percent (in 2021) in the caps on new discretionary appropriations for nondefense programs, resulting in outlay savings of $294 billion."
*"Reductions ranging from 10.0 percent (in 2013) to 8.5 percent (in 2021) in mandatory budgetary resources for nonexempt defense programs, generating savings of about $0.1 billion."
*"Reductions of 2.0 percent each year in most Medicare spending because of the application of a special rule that applies to that program, producing savings of $123 billion, and reductions ranging from 7.8 percent (in 2013) to 5.5 percent (in 2021) in mandatory budgetary resources for other nonexempt nondefense programs and activities, yielding savings of $47 billion. Thus, savings in nondefense mandatory spending would total $170 billion."
*"About $31 billion in outlays stemming from the reductions in premiums for Part B of Medicare and other changes in spending that would result from the sequestration actions." 
*"An estimated reduction of $169 billion in debt-service costs."
*"In all, those automatic cuts would produce net budgetary savings of about $1.1 trillion over the 2013<U+2013>2021 period."<ref name="CBO Impact1"/>

===Discretionary spending===
[[File:Discretionary Spending Under CBO 2010 and 2013 Baselines.png|thumb|300px|Discretionary spending for the 2012-2020 periods, as projected in the CBO's ''Budget and Economic Outlook'' publications from January 2010 and February 2013. The [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] (which includes the sequester) is the primary difference.]]

Discretionary spending includes both defense and non-defense spending elements, but excludes mandatory programs such as Social Security and Medicare. The [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] included both caps on discretionary spending as well as the sequester, both of which reduce discretionary spending. CBO projected in February 2013 that under the sequester and Budget Control Act caps: 
*Discretionary spending outlays will be reduced from $1,285.3 billion in 2012 to $1,213.9 billion in 2013, a reduction of $71.4 billion or 5.6%. Discretionary spending will fall again to $1,170.0 billion in 2014, a decrease of $42.8 billion or 3.6%. 
*Discretionary spending will rise gradually from $1,170.0 in 2014 to $1,423.8 billion by 2023, an annual [[Compound annual growth rate|growth rate]] of 2.2% during the 2014 to 2023 period and 0.9% for the 2012-2023 period. The 2.2% growth rate approximates CBO's projected rate of inflation and is well below the annual spending growth rate of 6.3% from 2000 to 2012.
*Discretionary spending will fall steadily from 8.3% GDP in 2012 to 5.5% GDP by 2023. Discretionary spending averaged 7.7% GDP from 1990 to 2012, ranging from 6.2% GDP to 9.0% GDP.<ref name="CBO Outlook1">{{cite web | title=The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2013 to 2023 |author=CBO |url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43907 |date=February 2013 |publisher=CBO |accessdate=February 2013}}</ref>

====Defense spending====
CBO projected in February 2013 that under the sequester and Budget Control Act caps:
*Defense spending outlays (including "overseas contingency operations" for Iraq and Afghanistan) will be reduced from $670.3 billion in 2012 to approximately $627.6 billion in 2013, a decrease of $42.7 billion or 6.4%. Defense spending will fall again to $593.4 billion in 2014, a decrease of $34.2 billion or 5.5%.
*Defense spending will rise gradually from $593 billion in 2014 to $714 billion by 2023, an annual growth rate of 2.1% during the 2014 to 2023 period and 0.6% for the 2012-2023 period. The 2.1% growth rate approximates CBO's projected rate of inflation and is well below the annual spending growth rate of 7.1% from 2000-2012.
*Defense spending will fall steadily from 4.3% GDP in 2012 to 2.8% GDP by 2023. Defense spending averaged 4.0% GDP from 1990 to 2012, ranging from 3.0% GDP to 5.2% GDP.<ref name="CBO Outlook1"/>

In spite of these reductions, the major defense contractors saw good profits during the sequester.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140208/DEFREG02/302080024 |title=DoD Skeptical of Companies' 'Rosy' Forecasts |last1=FRYER-BIGGS |first1=ZACHARY |date=8 February 2014 |website=www.defensenews.com |publisher=Gannett Government Media |accessdate=8 February 2014}} </ref>

Kelly (Marine)|Kelly]] testified that while border security was an 'Existential' threat to the country, due to budget cuts his forces were unable to respond to 75% of illicit trafficking events.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.defenseone.com/threats/2014/07/top-general-says-mexico-border-security-now-existential-threat-us/87958/ |title=Top General Says Mexico Border Security Now <U+2018>Existential<U+2019> Threat to U.S. |last1=O'Toole |first1=Molly |date=5 July 2014 |website=www.defenseone.com |publisher=National Journal Group, Inc. |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref>

====Non-defense discretionary spending====
Non-defense discretionary spending includes Cabinet Departments and Agencies. CBO projected in February 2013 that under the sequester and Budget Control Act caps:
*Non-defense discretionary spending outlays will be reduced from $615.0 billion in 2012 to approximately $586.3 billion in 2013, a reduction of $28.7 billion or 4.7%. This spending will fall again to $576.6 billion in 2014, a decrease of $9.7 billion or 1.6%.
*Non-defense discretionary spending will rise gradually from $576.6 billion in 2014 to $709.8 billion by 2023, an annual growth rate of 2.3% during the 2014 to 2023 period and 1.3% for the 2012-2023 period. The 2.3% growth rate approximates CBO's projected rate of inflation and is well below the annual spending growth rate of 5.6% from 2000-2012.
*Non-defense discretionary spending will fall steadily from 4.0% GDP in 2012 to 2.7% GDP by 2023. This spending averaged 3.8% GDP from 1990 to 2012, ranging from 3.2% GDP to 4.6% GDP.<ref name="CBO Outlook1"/>

===Mandatory spending===
Mandatory spending represents outlays to qualified program participants. It does not have to be renewed annually. Major categories of mandatory spending include Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.  The latter two programs are not in the scope of the sequester. An estimated $170 billion over the 2013-2022 period would be saved relative to the pre-sequester path.<ref name="CBO Impact1"/>

====Medicare====
CBO estimated in September 2011 that "most" Medicare spending would be reduced by approximately 2% per year versus planned levels, for total savings of $123 billion over the 2013-2022 period.<ref name="CBO Impact1"/> CBO projects that Medicare spending will rise from $551 billion in 2012 to over $1 trillion in 2023, despite the sequester. This is an annual growth rate of 6.3%.<ref name="CBO Outlook1"/>  Starting April 1, 2013 the sequester cut 2% of the Medicare budget, primarily targeting oncologist reimbursements.<ref>[http://www.medicarebenefits.com/sequester-has-real-effects-for-elderly-cancer-patients/ Sequester Has Real Effects For Medicare] Medicare Benefits: Hank Pomeranz Retrieved April 10, 2013.</ref>  Since oncologists cannot change the drug prices, they argue that the entire 2 percent cut will have to come out of the 6 percent overhead they use to cover the cost of storing and administering the medication.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/03/cancer-clinics-are-turning-away-thousands-of-medicare-patients-blame-the-sequester/ Cancer clinics are turning away thousands of Medicare patients] The Washington Post: Sarah Kliff Retrieved April 3, 2013.</ref>

====Other mandatory spending====
Other mandatory spending totaling $47 billion would also be reduced during the 2013-2022 period.<ref name="CBO Impact1"/>
This includes cuts to aid for Women, Infants, and Children ([[WIC]]) and the [[Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program]]. [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families]] (welfare) and the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (food stamps) are however exempt from sequestration.<ref name="WPostEverything"/>

===Interest savings===
CBO estimated in September 2011 that interest would be reduced by approximately $170 billion over a decade if the sequester is implemented, due to relatively lower national debt levels compared to the previously planned path.<ref name="CBO Impact1"/>

===Timing of outlay reduction===
CBO explained why it expects the sequestration to reduce outlays by $42 billion in fiscal year 2013, although the automatic budget cuts total $85 billion: "The $85 billion represents the reduction in budgetary resources available to government agencies this year as a result of the sequestration. But not all of that money would have been spent in this fiscal year in the absence of the sequestration: Some would have been used to enter into contracts to buy goods or services to be provided and paid for next year or in subsequent years. Acquiring major weapons systems and completing large construction projects, for example, can take several years. The $42 billion figure is CBO<U+2019>s estimate of the reduction in cash disbursements in fiscal year 2013; much of the remaining outlay reductions from the 2013 sequestration will occur in fiscal year 2014, though some will occur later."<ref name="CBO Impacts of Sequester1"/>

==The sequester in 2014 and beyond==
The [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]] reported in April 2012 that the process for 2014 and beyond is different from 2013:<ref>[http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=3635 Center on Budget and Policy Priorities-How the Across-the-Board Cuts in the Budget Control Act Will Work-April 27, 2012]</ref>
*If Congress passes appropriations legislation that are below the Budget Control Act caps, then "unlike in 2013, there will be no automatic cut of all affected defense programs by the same percentage." The same will be true for the non-defense discretionary cuts.
*"For non-defense programs, the process in years after 2013 is the same as in 2013 for entitlements but different for non-defense discretionary programs."
*"Medicare payments to providers and health insurance plans will continue to be cut by 2 percent; in other words, for the entire nine-year period 2013-2021, providers and plans will be paid 98 cents on the dollar. But because Medicare costs are projected to rise from 2013 through 2021, the dollar amount saved by this 2 percent cut will increase, from $11.0 billion in 2013 to $11.4 billion in 2014 and ultimately to $17.8 billion in 2021."
*"Because Medicare will take a growing share of the $54.7 billion annual non-defense cut (it will account for 21 percent of that amount in 2014 but 33 percent in 2021), other non-defense programs will absorb a declining share of the cut."

The sequestration levels will not be enforced until January of each fiscal year, because historically Congress would pass appropriations bills later than the beginning of the fiscal year, and the final appropriated amounts would not be known until after Congress had adjourned at the end of the calendar year.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kogan|first=Richard|title=Timing of the 2014 Sequestration|url=http://www.offthechartsblog.org/timing-of-the-2014-sequestration/|publisher=Center on Budget and Policy Priorities|accessdate=15 October 2013|date=22 August 2013}}</ref>

In December 2013, the [[Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013]] changed the sequestration caps for FY2014 and FY2015. This deal would eliminate some of the spending cuts required by the sequester by $45 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in January and $18 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in 2015.  Federal spending would thus be larger in these two years, but would be less in subsequent years until 2023,<ref name=CNNplainenglish>{{cite news|last=Desjardins|first=Lisa|title=The budget deal in plain English|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/10/the-budget-deal-in-plain-english/|accessdate=11 December 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=10 December 2013}}</ref> due to other provisions such as imposing sequester cuts in 2022 and 2023, raising airline fees and changing the pension contribution requirements of new federal workers.

==Economic effects==
[[Alan Krueger]], chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, predicted that the sequestration would contribute significant economic headwinds that would slow the recovery of the U.S. labor market.<ref name=4YearLow>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/09/business/economy/us-added-236000-jobs-in-february.html|title=Unemployment at 4-Year Low as U.S. Hiring Gains Steam|date=March 8, 2013|first=Nelson D.|last=Schwartz|publisher=New York Times}}</ref> In February 2012 the CBO reported, "In the absence of sequestration, CBO estimates, GDP growth would be about 0.6 percentage points faster during [the 2013] calendar year, and the equivalent of about 750,000 more full-time jobs would be created or retained by the fourth quarter." <ref name="CBO Impacts of Sequester1">{{cite web |title=Automatic Reductions in Government Spending -- aka Sequestration |url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43961 |date=February 28, 2013 |publisher=CBO |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref>

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] reported one estimate that implementation of the sequester could cost 700,000 jobs.<ref name="nytimes.com"/><ref>[http://macroadvisers.blogspot.com/2013/02/mas-alternative-scenario-march-1_19.html#!/2013/02/mas-alternative-scenario-march-1_19.html Macroadvisers-MA's Alternative Scenario: March 1 Sequestration-February 2013]</ref> The [[International Monetary Fund]] plans to lower its 2013 GDP growth forecast for the U.S. from 2.0% to 1.5% if the sequester is implemented.<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-28/imf-says-it-will-lower-u-s-outlook-because-of-sequestration-1-.html Bloomberg-IMF Says It Will Lower U.S. Outlook Because of Sequestration-February 28, 2013]</ref>

Federal Reserve Chair [[Ben Bernanke]] testified in February 2013 that the Federal government should replace the sequester with smaller cuts today and larger cuts in the future, due to concerns the sequester would slow the economy.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/business/as-budget-cuts-loom-austerity-kills-off-government-jobs.html?pagewanted=1&recp=6&src=rec NYT-Binyamin Appelbaum-Austerity Kills Government Jobs as Cuts to Budgets Loom-February 26, 2013]</ref> He reminded lawmakers of the CBO's guidance that recent austerity measures were projected to reduce economic growth by up to 1.5 percentage points in 2013 (relative to what it would have been otherwise), of which 0.6 percentage points related to the sequester. Bernanke stated that the long-run fiscal issues mainly related to an aging population and healthcare costs. He wrote: "To address both the near- and longer-term [fiscal] issues, the Congress and the Administration should consider replacing the sharp, front-loaded spending cuts required by the sequestration with policies that reduce the federal deficit more gradually in the near term but more substantially in the longer run. Such an approach could lessen the near-term fiscal headwinds facing the recovery while more effectively addressing the longer-term imbalances in the federal budget."<ref name="Bernanke Testimony Feb13">{{cite web |title=FRB Testimony on the Seminannual Monetary Policy Report to Congress |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20130226a.htm |date=February 26, 2013 |publisher=Federal Reserve|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}</ref>
 
Bernanke also explained that although current laws would stabilize the debt to GDP ratio at around 75%, the ratio averaged less than 40% from 1960 to the onset of the crisis in 2008: "This relatively low level of debt provided the nation much-needed flexibility to meet the economic challenges of the past few years. Replenishing this fiscal capacity will give future Congresses and Administrations greater scope to deal with unforeseen events."<ref name="Bernanke Testimony Feb13"/>

A few months later, the [[Federal Open Markets Committee]] reviewed the latest economic data and concluded that the sequestration was "restraining economic growth" and slowing the recovery in the jobs market.<ref>{{Citation| last = Rushe| first = Dominic| title = Federal Reserve blames Congress sequester cuts for US economic woes| newspaper = [[The Guardian]]| date = May 1, 2013| url =http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/01/federal-reserve-congress-cuts-policy| accessdate = 2013-09-24}}</ref>

A May 2014 report from the Government Accountability Office quantified the effects of the sequestration on federal employees and concluded that the Justice Department laid off one staff member as a result. <ref>{{Citation| last = Wasson| first = Eric| title = Report finds one federal layoff from sequester| newspaper = [[The Hill]]| date = May 9, 2014| url =http://thehill.com/policy/finance/205472-coburn-outraged-after-report-finds-budget-cuts-caused-one-layoff#ixzz31F9vjXIy| accessdate = 2014-05-09}}</ref>

==Impact on research funding==
Under sequestration, agencies that fund research and development would see their budgets cut 5.1 to 7.3 percent in 2013 and remain stagnant through 2021.<ref name="FT R&D">{{cite web|first1=Rafael|last1=Reif|first2=Craig|last2=Barrett|title=Science must be spared Washington<U+2019>s axe|date=February 25, 2013|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=March 3, 2013|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/14e4e522-7f7d-11e2-97f6-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2MVxIsFBW}}</ref>  In the next three years, this reduction in R&D is projected to decrease the number of jobs by 600,000. The  Information Technology & Innovation Foundation estimates sequestration will reduce GDP by $200 billion compared to a scenario where R&D funding were fixed at 2011 amounts and by $565 billion compared to a scenario where R&D funding grows in proportion to output.<ref name="FT R&D" />
 
The current Director of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), [[Francis S. Collins]], said: "I worry desperately this means we will lose a generation of young scientists."  Grant applications are already funded at half their historic rate, and with the sequester the chances of approval are expected to decrease even further.<ref name="Science faces sequestration cuts">{{cite news|last=Vergano|first=Dan|title=Science faces sequestration cuts|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/sciencefair/2013/02/25/budget-nih-collins/1947277/|publisher=USA Today|date=February 25, 2013|accessdate=March 3, 2013}}</ref> Former NIH head Dr. [[Elias Zerhouni]] argued that the sequester would have a substantial impact on the future of scientific research. Since the NIH will have to continue to fund existing research, the sequester will fall heavily on new research proposals. The current generation of rising scientists will find it particularly hard to fund their research projects.<ref name="Wonkblog NIH">{{cite news|title=Former NIH director: The sequester will set back medical science for a generation|author=Dylan Mathews|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/02/21/former-nih-director-the-sequester-will-set-back-medical-science-for-a-generation/|date=February 21, 2013|accessdate=March 3, 2013|publisher=Washington Post}}</ref>

==Other Impacts==
In September 2013, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] released a report entitled "Voices from the Field" citing the impacts of sequestration to include "New intelligence investigations were not being opened. Criminal cases were being closed. Informants couldn<U+2019>t be paid. And there was not enough funding for agents to put gas in their cars."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/fbiaa.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/docs/voices_from_the_field_-_fbia.pdf|title=Voices from the Field|author=FBI|accessdate=Sep 29, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/new-fbi-director-james-b-comey-stunned-by-impact-of-sequestration-on-agents-in-the-field/2013/09/27/0af002d8-2791-11e3-b75d-5b7f66349852_story.html|title=New FBI Director James B.
