[[Image:GreaseLP.jpg|right|Original cast recording]]'''''Grease''''' is a [[musical theater|musical]] by [[Jim Jacobs]] and [[Warren Casey]].

It takes its name from the  [[1950s]] [[United States]] [[Working class|working-class]] [[youth subculture]] known as the [[Greaser (subculture)|greasers]]. The musical, set in 1959 in [[List of fictional schools|fictional]] Rydell High in [[Chicago]], focuses on the romance between [[high school]]ers Danny Zuko and Sandy Dumbrowski and tackles such social issues as [[teenage pregnancy]] and [[gang violence]]; its themes include [[love]], [[friendship]], [[Juvenile delinquency|teenage rebellion]], sexual exploration during [[adolescence]] and, to some extent, [[class consciousness]]/[[class conflict]].

The show's original 1971 incarnation was a play with incidental music<ref>Sharbutt, Jay. [[Associated Press]] (Nov. 4, 1979): Untitled article about ''Grease''; quoted in [http://www.artistswithaids.org/artforms/music/catalogue/casey.html The Estate Project for Artists with AIDS: Warren Casey - Music Archive Catalog]</ref> staged at the Kingston Mines Theater in the Old Town section of Chicago. Producers [[Ken Waissman]] and Maxine Fox saw it and suggested to the [[playwrights]] it might work better as a full-scale musical, and told them if they were willing to rework it and if they liked the end result, they would produce it [[off-Broadway]]. The team headed to [[New York City]] and after additional collaboration and refinements, ''Grease'' opened at the Eden Theatre in downtown [[Manhattan]] on [[February 14]], [[1972]]. Excellent reviews and brisk box-office business prompted the producers to move it uptown.

The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway production]], directed by Tom Moore and [[choreographed]] by [[Patricia Birch]] (who eventually went to direct the [[Grease 2|ill-fated sequel]] of the film adaptation of Grease), opened [[June 7]], 1972 at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]], where it ran for five months before transferring to the [[Royale Theatre|Royale]]. It remained there for more than seven years before moving to the [[Majestic Theatre|Majestic]] to complete its 3388-performance run. The original cast included [[Barry Bostwick]] as Danny and Carole Demas as Sandy, with [[Adrienne Barbeau]], Timothy Meyers, and [[Walter Bobbie]] in supporting roles. Replacements later in the run included [[Jeff Conaway]], [[Marilu Henner]], [[Peter Gallagher]], [[Ilene Graff]], [[Judy Kaye]], [[Patrick Swayze]], [[John Travolta]], [[Jerry Zaks]], and [[Treat Williams]].

The show went on to become a  [[West End theatre|West End]] hit, a [[Grease (film)|hugely successful film]], a popular 1994 Broadway revival, and a staple of [[regional theatre]], [[summer stock]], [[community theatre]], and high school drama groups.

After twenty previews, a Broadway revival directed and choreographed by [[Jeff Calhoun]] opened on [[May 11]] [[1994]] at the [[Eugene O'Neill Theatre]], where it ran for 1505 performances. The original cast included [[Ricky Paull Goldin]] as Danny and [[Susan Wood]] as Sandy, with [[Megan Mullally]], [[Rosie O'Donnell]], [[Sam Harris (singer)|Sam Harris]], and [[Marcia Lewis]] in supporting roles. Replacements later in the run included [[Debby Boone]], [[Marilyn Cooper]], [[Mickey Dolenz]], [[Chubby Checker]], [[Sheena Easton]], [[Joely Fisher]], [[Sutton Foster]], [[Jasmine Guy]], [[Jennifer Holliday]], [[Al Jarreau]], [[Lucy Lawless]], [[Darlene Love]], [[Maureen McCormick]], [[Mackenzie Phillips]], [[Joe Piscopo]], [[Tracy Nelson]], [[Jon Secada]], [[Brooke Shields]], [[Sally Struthers]], [[Jody Watley]], [[Marissa Jaret Winokur]], [[Jo Anne Worley]], and [[Adrian Zmed]].  
  
A second Broadway revival, directed and choreographed by [[Kathleen Marshall]], is scheduled to begin previews in July 2007. [[Max Crumm]] and [[Laura Osnes]] were selected to portray Danny and Sandy via viewer votes cast during the run of the [[NBC]] [[reality series]] ''[[Grease: You're the One that I Want!]]''. The original score will be embellished with tunes written for the film adaptation: "Hopelessly Devoted to You," "Sandy," "You're the One That I Want," and the title number. A West End revival, with the leads similarly cast via [[ITV]]'s ''[[Grease Is The Word]]'', is also scheduled.

==Synopsis==

In 1959, Rydell High School's rebellious, thrill-loving students welcome new student Sandy Dumbrowski. She and the leader of the tough Burger Palace Boys gang, Danny Zuko, had a brief love affair the [[summer]] before, but the summer ended for them with unresolved feelings.  In describing the fling, Sandy focuses on the emotional attachment she and Danny had, while Danny stresses the physical aspects of their relationship.  Sandy and Danny soon bump into each other at school, and while Sandy is happy to see Danny, he blows her off, pretending to be too cool.  At Marty's pajama party, the girls experiment with wine, [[cigarette]]s and pierced ears, and Marty tells about her long-distance courtship with a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]]. The boys focus on fast cars, mooning and the upcoming school dance.  Danny sees Sandy again and tries to apologize for his behavior, but she is hurt to find out that he has told his friends that she is "easy."  

Sandy stays away from the school dance. Meanwhile, Frenchie drops out of beauty school when she fails all her classes. Danny and Cha-Cha win the dance contest, and Rizzo gets back together with her guy, Kenickie. But Danny misses Sandy and takes up track to win back her affections.  But when they meet next, he moves too fast for her. Meanwhile, Danny doesn't know that the Boys have been challenged to a rumble by Cha-Cha's friends. Rizzo is worried that she's pregnant, but she's so mad at Kenickie that she tells him he's not the father. Rizzo doesn't want Sandy's sympathy, and Sandy still feels she has trouble fitting in at the new school. The next time Sandy sees Danny and the Burger Palace Boys, she has transformed herself into a greaser's dream date, leaving Danny "All Choked Up."  Rizzo is relieved to learn that she isn't pregnant, and she and Kenickie reunite.  All ends happily.
