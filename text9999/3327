The [[Roman province]] of '''Macedonia''' ({{lang-la|'''Provincia Macedoniae'''}}, {{lang-el|'''<U+0395><U+03C0><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03C7><U+03AF><U+03B1> <U+039C><U+03B1><U+03BA><U+03B5><U+03B4><U+03BF><U+03BD><U+03AF><U+03B1><U+03C2>'''}}) was officially established in 146 BC, after the Roman general [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]] defeated [[Andriscus of Macedon]], the last [[Ancient]] [[King of Macedon|King]] of [[Macedon]] in 148 BC, and after the four client republics ("[[tetrarchy]]") established by Rome in the region were dissolved. The province incorporated ancient [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], with the addition of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], [[Thessaly]], and parts of [[Illyria]], [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonia]] and [[Thrace]]. This created a much larger administrative area, to which the name of 'Macedonia' was still applied.

==Description==

===Organization===
After the reforms of [[Diocletian]] in the late 3rd century, [[#Epirus Vetus|Epirus Vetus]] was split off, and sometime in the 4th century, the province of Macedonia itself was divided into ''Macedonia Prima'' in the south and ''Macedonia Salutaris'' in the north. These provinces were all subordinate to the [[Diocese of Macedonia]], one of three dioceses which were included in the [[praetorian prefecture of Illyricum]], organized in 318. When the Prefecture was divided between the [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] Empires in 379, the Macedonian provinces were included in Eastern Illyricum. With the permanent division of the Empire in 395, Macedonia passed to the East, which would evolve into the [[Byzantine Empire]].

''Epirus vetus'' or ''Old Epirus'' was a [[province]] in the [[Roman Empire]] that corresponded to the region of [[Epirus]]. Between 146 BC and 395, it was incorporated into the Roman province of Macedonia.The capital<ref>The visible past: Greek and Roman history from archaeology 1960-1990 by Michael Grant, 1990, ISBN 0-684-19124-5, page 98</ref> of Epirus vetus was [[Nicopolis]], a city founded by [[Caesar Augustus|Octavian]] in memory of his victory over [[Mark Antony|Antony]] and [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra]] at [[Actium]].

===Macedonia Prima===
Macedonia Prima ("first Macedonia") was a province encompassing most of the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|kingdom of Macedonia]], coinciding with most of the modern Greek region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], and had [[Thessalonica]] as its capital.

===Macedonia Salutaris===

Also known as Macedonia Secunda ("second Macedonia") was a province encompassing partially [[Dardani]]a and the whole of [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonia]], the second being most of the present-day [[Republic of Macedonia]]. The town of [[Stobi]] located to the junction of the [[Crna (river)|Erig<U+00F3>n]] and [[Axi<U+00F3>s]] rivers, which was the former capital of Paeonia, arose later in the capital city of Macedonia Salutaris ("advantageous Macedonia").

===Economy===
The reign of [[Augustus]] began a long period of peace, prosperity and wealth for Macedonia, although its importance in the economic standing of the Roman world diminished when compared to its neighbor, [[Asia Minor]].

The economy was greatly stimulated by the construction of the [[Via Egnatia]], the installation of Roman merchants in the cities, and the founding of Roman colonies. The Imperial government brought, along with its roads and administrative system, an economic boom, which benefited both the Roman ruling class and the lower classes. With vast arable and rich pastures, the great ruling families amassed huge fortunes in the society based on slave labor.

The improvement of the living conditions of the productive classes brought about an increase in the number artisans and craftspeople to the region. Stonemasons, miners, blacksmiths, etc. were employed in every kind of commercial activity and craft. Greek people were also widely employed as tutors, educators and doctors throughout the Roman world.

The export economy was based essentially on agriculture and livestock, while iron, copper, and gold along with such products as timber, resin, pitch, hemp, flax and fish were also exported. Another source of wealth was the kingdom's ports, such as [[Dion, Greece|Dion]], [[Pella]], [[Thessalonica]], [[Cassandreia]].<ref>[http://www.unrv.com/provinces/macedonia.php Macedonia - Province of the Roman Empire<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
