'''[[Saint Lucia]]''' sent a delegation to compete at the '''[[2008 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[Beijing]], [[People's Republic of China|China]]. The 2008 Saint Lucian team included four athletes that competed in two sports: swimming and athletics. Of these four athletes, [[Danielle Beaubrun]], at age 18, was the youngest of the competitors. [[Dominic Johnson]], at age 32, was the oldest, and was the only man sent as part of the 2008 delegation; additionally, Johnson was the only Saint Lucian athlete in the 2008 delegation who had previously participated in the Olympics. 

None of the four athletes advanced past the qualifying stages, and thus did not win any medals. Evans ranked thirtieth overall in the qualifying round for javelin; Johnson also ranked thirtieth overall in the pole vault qualifying round; and Spencer ranked twenty-seventh in the qualifying round for high jump. Additionally, Beaubrun ranked forty-second in the swimming qualifying stages.

==Background==

The Saint Lucia Olympic Committee sent President Richard Peterkin, Minister of Youth and Sports Lenard Montoute, Chief de Mission Alfred Emmanuel, Coach Henry Bailey, and Coach Karen Beaubrun to Beijing alongside the four-person athletic delegation. Saint Lucia was the 67th nation in line at the [[2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]], in which high jumper Levern Spencer was the flagbearer.<ref name=Beauville /> Saint Lucians were unable to view the 7:00 am opening ceremony because of issues with the local cable provider.<ref name=Beauville />

Dominic Johnson participated in athletics as a pole vaulter, returning to the Olympics for his third time; Johnson had previously participated as a pole vaulter (and, at one time, a relay runner) on behalf of Saint Lucia in the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] and [[1996 Summer Olympics]]. Johnson flew to San Diego days before the competition cutoff and made the qualifying preliminary height for the Olympics shortly after winning a silver medal at the [[Central American and Caribbean Championships]] in Cali, Columbia.<ref name=SanDiego /> Johnson's event took place on August 20, 2008.<ref name=Beauville /> With a height of 5.30 metres, Johnson did not qualify, although he tied for seventeenth place in his qualifying group.

{{main|Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics}}

Danielle Beaubrun was the only Saint Lucian swimmer to participate in the Beijing Olympics. She was the youngest member of the Saint Lucian delegation, at age 18. The 2008 Summer Olympics served as Beaubrun's Olympic debut.<ref name=SportBackground /> Beaubrun did not initially qualify for Olympic standards. However, because Saint Lucia had no naturally qualifying swimmers, the country was invited by [[FINA]] to send two swimmers to the Olympics, granted the swimmer had participated in the 2007 World Championships. Beaubrun met this criterion, and was selected for this reason. At the time, Beaubrun was enrolled at [[The Bolles School]] in Jacksonville, Florida and trained with coach Sergio Lopez.<ref name=BeaubrunPool /> 

The event in which Beaubrun participated was the 100 meter [[breaststroke]]. This event took place on August 10, 2008.<ref name=Beauville /> In the second heat of the qualifying round, Beaubrun scored third, with a time of 1:12.85.<ref name=SriLanka /> However, overall, Danielle Beaubrun ranked forty-second, and, as a result, did not advance.<ref name=Beaubrunfocus />
