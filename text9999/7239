An additional soundtrack featuring compositions from the game's downloadable content ''[[The Last of Us: Left Behind]]'' was released in February 2014.

Throughout development of ''The Last of Us'', creative director [[Neil Druckmann]] and game director [[Bruce Straley]] had been compiling various musical tracks that they found inspirational. When searching for a composer to work on the game's music, they realised that many of the compiled tracks were composed by [[Gustavo Santaolalla]]. Straley described Santaolalla's music as "organic instrumentation, minimalist, dissonance and resonance with the sounds".<ref name="postmortem1"/> As a result, Sony reached out to Santaolalla, who agreed to work on the game's soundtrack.<ref name="postmortem1">{{cite web |url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/the-last-of-us-the-definitive-postmortem-spoilers-be-damned/2/ |title=The Last Of Us: the definitive postmortem <U+2013> spoilers be damned - Page 2 of 3 |page=2 |author=Staff |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |date=June 18, 2013 |accessdate=October 14, 2014 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TJZaDRJn |archivedate=October 14, 2014 |deadurl=no }}</ref> After hearing the game's pitch, Santaolalla was excited to work on the game; he previously wanted to work on video games, but refused to work on those without a focus on story and characters.<ref name="Audio Matters">{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/02/15/why-audio-matters-in-the-last-of-us.aspx |title=Why Audio Matters In The Last Of Us |last=Hanson |first=Ben |work=[[Game Informer]] |publisher=[[GameStop]] |date=February 15, 2012 |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Vb79esvr |archivedate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no }}</ref>

Due to Santaolalla's stance on composing music<U+2014>he lacks knowledge in reading and writing [[sheet music]], preferring to simply record<U+2014>he began working on ''The Last of Us'' early in development. To give Santaolalla a point to base his music, Druckmann simply told him about the story and themes, as opposed to giving specific instructions on composing; Santaolalla appreciated this freedom, feeling it assisted in the composing. To compose, Santaolalla felt the need to "go into some more dark place, more textural and not necessarily melodic".<ref name="Grounded">{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0l7LzC_h8I  |title=Grounded: Making The Last of Us |language=English |people=[[Naughty Dog]] and Area 5 |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |year=2013 |accessdate=October 11, 2014 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TEca1RXi |archivedate=October 10, 2014 |deadurl=no }}</ref> To challenge himself, Santaolalla used a variety of unique instruments he was unfamiliar with, giving a sense of danger and innocence. For ''The Last of Us'', he used a detuned guitar, producing deep noise. To produce unique tunes, Santaolalla recorded in various rooms, including a bathroom and kitchen.<ref name="Grounded"/> The team wanted the game's AI to affect the music. They also tried to make the music evoke a reaction from the player, as their familiarization with the sounds would trigger a previous emotion that they felt. Music manager Jonathan Mayer felt that the game's action music was atypical of action music in other games, stating that it's "relatively low-key", and that taking it out of context changes the immediate reaction to it.<ref name="Soundworks"/> The game's theme, "The Last of Us", was the first piece of music that the team received, and they were very impressed.<ref name="Soundworks">{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/23/4457258/naughty-dog-discusses-sound-and-music-in-the-last-of-us |title=Naughty Dog discusses sound and music in The Last of Us |last=Farokhmanesh |first=Megan |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 23, 2013 |accessdate=January 20, 2015 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VifAcU7v |archivedate=January 20, 2015 |deadurl=no }}</ref> The team aimed for a soundtrack that was "emotional", as opposed to being scary.<ref name="EuroMusic">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-12-13-the-last-of-us-scored-by-oscar-winner-gustavo-santaolalla |title=The Last Of Us scored by Oscar-winner Gustavo Santaolalla |last=Minkley |first=Johnny |work=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network |date=December 13, 2011 |accessdate=January 25, 2015 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VqP2X8ET |archivedate=January 25, 2015 |deadurl=no }}</ref> Inspired by the sparing use of music in the film ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'' (2007), the team used music judiciously and tried to find other ways to "make your palms sweaty".<ref name="GameStarMusic">{{cite web |url=http://gamestar.ru/english/1969.html |title=Neil Druckmann: "Survival encompasses the gameplay for The Last of Us" |work=[[GameStar]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=July 30, 2012 |accessdate=January 25, 2015 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VqP8efQU |archivedate=January 25, 2015 |deadurl=no }}</ref> The orchestral portions of the score were recorded at [[Ocean Way Studios]] in [[Nashville]] by the Nashville Scoring Orchestra.<ref name="Nashville">{{cite web |url=http://nashvillemusicscoring.com/?page=news&ID=16 |title=The Last Of Us setting sales records |publisher=Nashville Music Scoring |date=August 1, 2014 |accessdate=January 25, 2015 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VqPPg9zD |archivedate=January 25, 2015 |deadurl=no }}</ref>
