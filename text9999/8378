==Pre-history==
Prior to the release of Bitcoin there were a number of precursor ecash technologies starting with the issuer based [[ecash]] protocols of [[David Chaum]]

and [[Stefan Brands]], and moving on to distributed digital scarcity based ecash protocols starting from [[Adam Back]]'s [[hashcash]], [[Wei Dai]]'s b-money, [[Nick Szabo]]'s bit-gold and  [[Hal Finney (cypherpunk)|Hal Finney]]'s RPOW which build on hashcash.

Independently and at around the same time [[Wei Dai]] proposed b-money <ref>{{cite web|last=Dai|first=W|title=b-money|year=1998|url=http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt|accessdate=5 December 2013| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/62ArKBIqT | archivedate = 2011-10-04| deadurl=no}}</ref> and [[Nick Szabo]] proposed bit-gold.<ref>{{cite web|last=Szabo|first=Nick|title=Bit Gold|url=http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/12/bit-gold.html|work=Unenumerated|publisher=Blogspot|accessdate=5 December 2013|authorlink = Nick Szabo| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/61sMGP11i | archivedate = 2011-09-22| deadurl=no}}</ref>  Subsequently Hal Finney implemented and deployed [[RPOW]] a reusable form of hashcash based on IBM secure TPM hardware and remote attestation (centralized but with no issuer inflation risk).

Since the initial bit-gold proposal which proposed a collectible market based mechanism for inflation control [[Nick Szabo]] also investigated some additional enabling aspects for decentralized asset registers including Byzantine network issues.

There has been much speculation as to the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto with suspects including [[Wei Dai]], Hal Finney and accompanying denials.<ref name="LikeInAMirror1">{{cite web|title=Satoshi Nakamoto is (probably) Nick Szabo|url=https://likeinamirror.wordpress.com/2013/12/01/satoshi-nakamoto-is-probably-nick-szabo/#%21|work=LikeInAMirror|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=5 December 2013| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20140413135108/https://likeinamirror.wordpress.com/2013/12/01/satoshi-nakamoto-is-probably-nick-szabo/ | archivedate = 2014-04-13| deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last= Weisenthal |first= Joe |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/did-shinichi-mochizuki-invent-bitcoin-2013-5|title= Here's The Problem With The New Theory That A Japanese Math Professor Is The Inventor Of Bitcoin |publisher= Business Insider| date= 19 May 2013 |accessdate = 19 May 2013 |deadurl=no| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20131103105304/http://www.businessinsider.com/did-shinichi-mochizuki-invent-bitcoin-2013-5 | archivedate = 2013-11-03| deadurl=no}}</ref> The possibility that Satoshi Nakamoto was a computer collective in the European financial sector has also been bruited.<ref>[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-value-digital-currency-530480 Bitcoin Inventor Satoshi Nakamoto is Anonymous-style Cell from Europe] {{Wayback|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-value-digital-currency-530480|date =20131217221103}}</ref>

==Satoshi Nakamoto==
{{main|Satoshi Nakamoto}}
"Satoshi Nakamoto" was presumed to be a [[pseudonym]] for the person or people who designed the original Bitcoin protocol in 2008 and launched the network in 2009. Nakamoto was responsible for creating the majority of the official Bitcoin software and was active in making modifications and posting technical information on the BitcoinTalk Forum.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite news|title=The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin |url= http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/11/mf_bitcoin/ |publisher= [[Wired (website)|Wired]] |date=23 November 2011|accessdate= 13 October 2012 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20131031043919/http://www.wired.com:80/magazine/2011/11/mf_bitcoin | archivedate = 2013-10-31| deadurl=no}}</ref>

Investigations into the real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto were attempted by ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]''.

Stefan Thomas, a Swiss coder and active community member, graphed the time stamps for each of Nakamoto's 500-plus bitcoin forum posts; the resulting chart showed a steep decline to almost no posts between the hours of 5&nbsp;a.m. and 11&nbsp;a.m. Greenwich Mean Time. Because this pattern held true even on Saturdays and Sundays, it suggested that Nakamoto was asleep at this time, and the hours of 5&nbsp;a.m. to 11&nbsp;a.m. GMT are midnight to 6&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Standard Time. Other clues suggested that Nakamoto was British: A newspaper headline he had encoded in the genesis block came from the UK-published newspaper ''[[The Times]]'', and both his forum posts and his comments in the bitcoin source code used [[British English]] spellings, such as "optimise" and "colour".<ref>Benjamin Wallace: [http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/11/mf_bitcoin/all/ The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin], Wired, November 23, 2011 {{Wayback|url=http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/11/mf_bitcoin/all/|date =20131019023801}}</ref>

==The fork of March 2013==
On 12 March 2013, a Bitcoin miner running version 0.8.0 of the Bitcoin software created a large block that was incompatible with earlier versions of the Bitcoin software because of its size. This created a split or "fork" in the block chain since older versions of the software did not accept this block as valid. Computers with the recent version of the software accepted the block and continued to build on the diverging chain, whereas older versions of the software rejected it and continued extending the block chain without the offending block. This split resulted in two separate transaction logs being formed without clear consensus, which allowed for the same funds to be spent differently on each chain. In response, the Mt. Gox exchange temporarily halted Bitcoin deposits.<ref name="Mtgoxforkchain">{{cite web|last=Karpeles|first=Mark|title=Bitcoin blockchain issue&nbsp;<U+2013> bitcoin deposits temporarily suspended|url=https://mtgox.zendesk.com/entries/21477395-Bitcoin-blockchain-issue-bitcoin-deposits-temporarily-suspended|publisher=[[Mt.

==Regulatory issues==
On 18 March 2013, the [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] (or FinCEN), a bureau of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]], issued a report regarding [[centralized]] and decentralized "virtual currencies" and their legal status within "[[money services business]]" (MSB) and [[Bank Secrecy Act]] regulations.<ref name=FinCEN1 /><ref name="ABA FINCEN" /> It classified digital currencies and other digital payment systems such as Bitcoin as "virtual currencies" because they are not [[legal tender]] under any sovereign [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]. FinCEN cleared American users of Bitcoin of legal obligations<ref name="ABA FINCEN" /> by saying, "A user of virtual currency is not an MSB under FinCEN's regulations and therefore is not subject to MSB registration, reporting, and recordkeeping regulations." However, it held that American entities who generate "virtual currency" such as bitcoins are money transmitters or MSBs if they sell their generated currency for [[national currency]]: "...a person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another person for real currency or its equivalent is engaged in transmission to another location and is a money transmitter." This specifically extends to "miners" of the Bitcoin currency who may have to register as MSBs and abide by the legal requirements of being a money transmitter if they sell their generated bitcoins for [[national currency]] and are within the United States.<ref name="ArsFinCEN">{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Timothy|title=US regulator Bitcoin Exchanges Must Comply With Money Laundering Laws|url=http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/us-regulator-bitcoin-exchanges-must-comply-with-money-laundering-laws/|publisher=Arstechnica|date=20 March 2013|quote=Bitcoin miners must also register if they trade in their earnings for dollars. | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20131021203745/http://arstechnica.com:80/tech-policy/2013/03/us-regulator-bitcoin-exchanges-must-comply-with-money-laundering-laws/ | archivedate = 2013-10-21| deadurl=no}}</ref> Since FinCEN issued this guidance, dozens of virtual currency exchangers and administrators have registered with FinCEN, and FinCEN is receiving an increasing number of [[suspicious activity report]]s (SARs) from these entities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Remarks From Under Secretary of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S.

Additionally, FinCEN claimed regulation over American entities that manage bitcoins in a [[payment processor]] setting or as an exchanger: "In addition, a person is an exchanger and a money transmitter if the person accepts such de-centralized convertible virtual currency from one person and transmits it to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency."<ref name="Finextra1">{{cite web|title=US govt clarifies virtual currency regulatory position|url=http://www.finextra.com/News/FullStory.aspx?newsitemid=24645|publisher=Finextra|date=19 March 2013 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20140326183202/http://www.finextra.com/News/FullStory.aspx?newsitemid=24645 | archivedate = 2014-03-26| deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name="FinCEN1">{{cite web|title=Application of FinCEN's Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies|url=http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/pdf/FIN-2013-G001.pdf|publisher=Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network|accessdate=19 March 2013}}</ref>

On 19 June 2011, a security breach of the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange caused the nominal price of a bitcoin to fraudulently drop to one cent on the Mt.
