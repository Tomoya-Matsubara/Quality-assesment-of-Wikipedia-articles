Being interviewed in 2003 on Australian Music Online, Malcolm Clark ([[The Sleepy Jackson]]) remembered V Capri:
{{cquote|''What, where and when was the first local gig you attended?
:The first show I went to was a band called ''V-Capri'' in the mid '80s, who used to play at a venue called the Nookenburra in [[Innaloo, Western Australia|Innaloo]] (Perth). I was eight-years-old and I used to hang out there on Saturday afternoons while my dad watched the jazz band next door.
:One night my dad took me there and the roadies snuck me in the side-door as children weren<U+2019>t allowed in the venue. It was amazing to watch a real live band, wow. It<U+2019>s funny now because the lead singer (Todd [''sic''] Johnston) does the weather on TV. I wonder if he<U+2019>d remember me?<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amo.org.au/qa_interview.asp?id=101|title=The Sleepy Jackson talk up "Lovers"|last=Clark|first=Malcolm|publisher=Australian Music Online|date=7 July 2003|accessdate=27 April 2009}}</ref>''}}
