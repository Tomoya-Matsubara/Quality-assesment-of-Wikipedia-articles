The '''Adams Avenue Parkway''' is a {{convert|0.5|mi|km|1|adj=on}} [[private toll road|private]] [[toll road]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Utah]] connecting [[U.S. Route 89 in Utah|U.S. Route 89]] (US-89) to [[Interstate 84 in Utah|Interstate 84]] (I-84) near [[Washington Terrace, Utah]]. The roadway opened in 2001 at a cost of $8.9 million and was created after decades of requests by locals to connect the existing Adams Avenue to I-84. This allowed commuters to bypass the rest of US-89 through Washington Terrace to I-84.

==Route description==

The main access to the south end of the parkway is from I-84 at exit 85, a pre-existing [[diamond interchange]] with a local road in [[South Weber, UT|South Weber]] named 475 East. The four-lane {{convert|35|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|lk=on}} toll road, which has no [[shoulder (road)|shoulder]]s or [[sidewalk]]s, begins at Cottonwood Drive, I-84's northside [[frontage road]]. It immediately crosses a bridge over the [[Weber River]] (the [[Davis County, UT|Davis]]-[[Weber County, UT|Weber County]] line and north limit of South Weber) and the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]'s [[Evanston Subdivision]] (the south limit of [[Washington Terrace, UT|Washington Terrace]]). The parkway then curves northwest and climbs out of the Weber River's [[floodplain]] with a maximum [[grade (slope)|grade]] of nine&nbsp;percent,<ref name=audit>Legislative Auditor General, [http://www.le.state.ut.us/audit/07_03rpt.pdf Report to the Utah State Legislature Number 2007-03: A Performance Audit of UDOT Project Costs], January 2007, accessed August 2008, pp. 27-31</ref> reaching the [[toll plaza]] most of the way up the hill. After one intersection with 5900 South, which presently serves only the toll road company's headquarters and a single [[commercial development|commercial]] building<!--5875 South Adams-->, private maintenance gives way to a four-lane city street with sidewalks just shy of 5800 South.<ref name="w county map" /> The roadway continues northeasterly to the top of the hill near 5600 South, where pre-existing Adams Avenue (500 East) heads north, passing the [[Ogden Regional Medical Center]] to an intersection with Washington Boulevard ([[US-89 (UT)|US-89]]) on the Washington Terrace-[[South Ogden, UT|South Ogden]] border. Adams Avenue continues through South Ogden and into [[Ogden, UT|Ogden]] as a minor street one block east of US-89, with a gap near 4600 South and more north of downtown Ogden.<ref name="gmaps" /><ref name="TRN-pike does well">{{cite web|url=http://www.tollroadsnews.com/node/306|title=Utah developer pike does well|date=2003-07-03|publisher=TOLLROADSnews|accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref> As of 2006, approximately 1,400&nbsp;cars travel the parkway on a weekday.<ref name="herald">{{cite news |first=John |last=Wright |title=Bill seeks to add toll roads |url=http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/161329/3/ |work= |publisher=Daily Herald |date=2006-01-22 |accessdate=2008-07-08 }}</ref>

==Tolls==

Tolls are collected in cash or via an ExpressCard account, a prepaid system that offers a discount for a $10&nbsp;deposit to the account. The current toll is $1 in each direction for two-axle vehicles and $0.50 for each additional axle.<ref name="adams prices">{{cite web|url=http://adamsavenueparkway.com/aap_004.htm|title=Adams Avenue Parkway - Prices|accessdate=2008-08-02}}</ref> Previously emergency vehicles ([[ambulance]]s) were not charged a toll, but as of July 3, 2003,<ref name="dn ambulance">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20030714/ai_n11411901|title=No break for sirens on toll parkway|last=[[Associated Press]]|work=[[Find Articles]]|publisher=[[Deseret News]]|date=2003-07-14|accessdate=2008-08-02}}</ref> they must pay the standard $1&nbsp;toll. To allow quick passage through the toll barrier, these vehicles pay through a charge account. 

The [[Utah Department of Transportation]] worked out an agreement during local road construction for four days in 2003 to allow commuters to use the parkway free of charge.<ref name="dn free">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20030817/ai_n11404638?tag=content;col1|title=Alternate provided for U.S. 89 drivers|date=2003-08-17|work=[[Find Articles]]|publisher=[[Deseret News]]|accessdate=2008-08-02}}</ref>

==History==

Local residents led by Doug and Bruce Stephens<ref name="herald" /> urged the state to connect I-84 directly to Adams Avenue, bypassing the congested US-89. Then governor [[Mike Leavitt]] suggested that a private company rather than the state would need to build the road.

The roadway cost $8.9&nbsp;million to build, of which the state provided $2&nbsp;million.<ref name="trib funds">{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SLTB&p_theme=sltb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=100F8874099EB29C&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Toll-Road Proposal Gets State Money; Toll Road Proposal to Get State Funds|last=Keahey|first=John|coauthors=Fahys, Judy|date=1997-03-04|publisher=[[Salt Lake Tribune]]|accessdate=2008-08-02}}</ref> Additional funds came from taxes levied on property owners along the parkway.<ref name="DN gap">{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=DSNB&d_place=DSNB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F364BF9E684EE1C&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=City to fill gap from I-84 to Adams road|date=1998-01-05|publisher=[[Deseret News]]|accessdate=2008-08-02}}</ref> The entire stretch of road between Washington Street and I-84 was built by the Adams Avenue Turnpike LLC; however, they returned  most of the road to local authorities.

The roadway is defined under Weber County Ordinance, Title&nbsp;31,<ref name="weber">{{cite web |url=http://www.co.weber.ut.us/ordinances/print_ordinance.php?title=31 |title=Title 31 - Ordinance Amending a Previous Grant of a Toll Road Franchise |accessdate=2008-07-08 |work=Weber County Ordinances |publisher=[[Weber County, Utah]]}}</ref> which grants a franchise to Adams Avenue Turnpike LLC<ref name="TRN-pike does well" /> for an initial term of 50&nbsp;years (expiring in 2051).
