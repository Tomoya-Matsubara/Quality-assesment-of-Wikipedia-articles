Mindwipe is a [[Decepticon]] [[Headmaster (Transformers)|Headmaster]] who transforms into a [[bat]].

Mindwipe's [[tech spec]] describes him as a mystic who spends more time trying to contact the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] essences of long-dead Decepticons than talking to live ones. His electromagnetic probings sometimes intercept [[television]] broadcasts from [[Earth]].

Mindwipe is [[binary-bonded]] to Vorath, [[Nebulon]]'s former Science Minister, who was expelled because of illegal experiments.

In the [[Japan]]ese fiction, Vorath is a small, completely mechanical Decepticon from the planet Master, who transforms into the head of the larger robot. The larger Wipe body he controls is a non-living machine. The Headmaster component is named Vorath on the Japanese box, but he is only referred to as Wipe in the Japanese animated series. 

===Marvel Comics===
Note: U.K.-only stories are in ''italics''. 

Mindwipe originally appeared in the four issue ''[[The Transformers: Headmasters]]'' comic, where he was binary bonded to his Headmaster partner Vorath. 

''Issue #248 of the Marvel U.K. Transformers comic featured a story called "Fallen Star", where [[Starscream]] began to doubt himself, despite being of the most powerful Transformers. [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]], Mindwipe and [[Weirdwolf]] feared Starscream would attack, but Starscream thought they were laughing at him behind his back. Leaving Starscream came across the Autobots [[Chainclaw]], [[Cloudburst (Transformers)|Cloudburst]] and [[Getaway (Transformers)|Getaway]], who were assigned by [[Optimus Prime]] to spy on him. Starscream soundly defeated all three [[Autobot]]s and regained his self confidence.''

He last appeared in the U.S. ''Generation 1'' series in issue #75, "On the Edge of Extinction".

Mindwipe made an appearance in the Decepticon forces under the command of Megatron in issue #7 of the Marvel ''Generation 2'' comic series, in a story called "New Dawn". Megatron lead his Decepticons against [[Jhiaxus]]'s second generation Cybertronians near the moon of Tykos. The Decepticons were defeated and Megatron left injured, presumed dead, but swearing revenge. <ref>http://www.seibertron.com/comics/view.php?comic_id=113</ref>

===Animated series===
Mindwipe only appeared in the U.S. [[The Transformers (TV series)|Transformers TV series]] in the 3-part episode "The Rebirth".

[[Image:Chaostrinity.jpg|left|thumb|Members of the Chaos Trinity - Bugly, Bludgeon and Mindwipe]]
Mindwipe was one of the members of the [[Chaos Trinity]] in the second ''War Within'' series. In this series he turns into a Cybertronian jet and isn't a Headmaster yet. 

When [[Megatron]] and [[Autobot]] leader [[Optimus Prime]] disappeared in an accident with a [[Space Bridge]], the Autobot and Decepticon forces splintered into smaller factions. [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]] became leader of the Chaos Trinity, which was comprised of himself, [[Bugly]] and Mindwipe. The Chaos Trinity was devoted to expanding its members' knowledge of the mystic arts. The Chaos Trinity acted as master manipulators, tricking others into doing their work for them. For instance, when Shockwave's faction developed [[Trypticon]], the Chaos Trinity tipped off the Autobots under [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]] where it was being tested. The Chaos Trinity came into the service of [[Fallen (Transformers)|the Fallen]], an ancient Transformer who betrayed Primus and was now an agent of Unicron. The Fallen promised to expand their mystic powers in return for their loyalty, after threatening to kill them if they didn't join him. Attacking a meeting between Jetfire and Shockwave, hypnotising the former and incapacitating the latter, they were then beaten by [[Grimlock]], who had come because he believed that Jetfire was betraying them. However, this was all part of a bigger set-up by the Fallen, who easily defeated the Dinobot leader. Then battling the [[Protectobot]]s and kidnapping Hot Spot, the Trinity took him to the Fallen for an arcane ritual. However, they were attacked by Shockwave's Decepticons. Shockwave personally gunned down Mindwipe, with Bugly falling to a combined barrage. Bludgeon fled, but was blasted by a teleporting [[Skywarp]]
