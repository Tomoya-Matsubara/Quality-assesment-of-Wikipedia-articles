"'''Lovers in Japan'''" is a song by English [[alternative rock]] band [[Coldplay]]. It was written by all members of the band for their fourth album, ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]''. The song is built around an introductory [[tack piano]] sound, then followed by chiming guitars and soaring choruses, supported by the pianos and rhythms that accompany the song's lyrics. "Lovers in Japan" also includes a hidden track "Reign of Love".<ref name="wash" /> 

It was released on 4 November 2008 as the fourth single from ''Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends'' and has reached number 10 in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles]] chart. The song has also appeared on ''Billboard's'' [[Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks]] on the number 32 peak position. "Lovers in Japan" received positive reception, with music critics noting the track's sound. 

==Writing and composition==
When asked about the development of the song, during a track-by-track reveal, drummer [[Will Champion]] said: "We were in a studio in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a [[tack piano]] there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a [[harpsichord]] almost. And so we wanted to use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and [[Guy Berryman|Guy]] and [[Jonny Buckland|Jon]] spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1589032/20080609/coldplay.jhtml|title=Coldplay Give Track-By-Track Tour Of ''Viva La Vida'', Explain Handclaps, Tack Pianos And The Number 42|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=2008-06-09|work=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-coldplay-viva-la-vida-or-death-and-all-his-friends-parlophone-841196.html|title=Album: Coldplay, Viva La Vida, or Death and All His Friends|last=Gill|first=Andy|date=2008-06-06|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=''independent.co.uk''|accessdate=2008-12-05}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine, when asked about why "Lovers in Japan" had a hidden track, Guy Berryman explained that the band could not make up their minds, because they had discussed that they did not want an extra song on the album, and instead they wanted to keep the album concise with a total of ten tracks.<ref name="q music">{{cite news|url=http://news.q4music.com/2008/05/coldplay_viva_la_vida_2.html|title=Coldplay - Viva la Vida|date=2008-05-15|work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|page=2|accessdate=2009-02-19}}</ref> Champion followed with, "We just preferred to have less titles and more stuff.

Critics were positive towards the song.

The first half of the video shows the band playing in a courtyard while each member writes certain words from the lyrics in glowing neon on the screen. During the chorus, the camera spins around in circles to go along with the lines "They are turning my head out".<ref name="yahoo video" /> The video ends with butterfly-shaped confetti raining on the band, as happens when each chorus is played at live concerts.<ref name="yahoo video" />
