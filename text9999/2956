'''Odwalla Inc.''' (pronounced Oh-dwa-la)<ref name="Yahoo"/> is a [[health food]] company founded in [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], [[California]] in 1980 that sells fruit juice and [[food bars]]. Currently, Odwalla is headquartered in [[Half Moon Bay, California]], and its production facility is located in [[Dinuba, California]]. The name "Odwalla" was taken from that of a character in the song "Illistrum" written by the [[Art Ensemble of Chicago]] jazz group as a metaphor for their company.

The company has experienced strong growth from its incorporation in 1985, expanding out from [[California]] to cover many parts of the United States and Canada. However, a period of decline occurred as a result of an outbreak of ''[[E. Coli|E.&nbsp;Coli]]'' [[bacteria]] in their apple juice in 1996. A recall was issued by the company, and Odwalla experienced a ninety&nbsp;percent reduction in sales following the event. The company gradually recovered, and, after a few years, the company was making a profit again. While originally it was a [[publicly traded]] company, Odwalla was acquired by the [[Coca-Cola Company]] in 2001 for US$181&nbsp;million.

The Odwalla brand includes "day-of-juicing quality" juices, smoothies, dairy-free soy milk, and similar organic beverages, as well as several flavors of energy bars, known as [[food bars]], and [[Bottled water|bottled spring water]].<ref name="tenq">{{cite press release

They came up with the idea of selling fruit juices from a business guidebook, and the trio began by squeezing orange juice with a secondhand juicer in a shed in Steltenpohl's backyard.

===Incorporation<U+2013>1996===
[[Image:Odwalla HQ.JPG|thumb|right|The headquarters of Odwalla Inc. in [[Half Moon Bay, California]].]]
The founders' small business was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in September 1985 after five years of growth,<ref name="SEC"/> and expanded to sell products in [[San Francisco]] in 1988. Hambrecht & Quist Inc., a [[venture capital]] firm in San Francisco, was one of Odwalla's main investors at the time, investing several million dollars in the company.<ref name="music"/> By 1992 the company employed 80 people at their company headquarters in [[Davenport, California]] and sold around 20 different flavors of juice for between $1.50 and $2.00 a pint. Odwalla went [[IPO|public]] in December 1993, and the company had 35 delivery trucks, almost 200 employees, and made about $13&nbsp;million a year. Soon afterwards, the company expanded into new markets when it bought two companies in the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[Denver, Colorado]].<ref name="history"/>

Odwalla Inc. built a new production facility at 1765&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Davis Drive in [[Dinuba, California]] in 1994 in order to better meet production demands.<ref>{{cite web

Continual growth and outside investments during the early years of the company allowed the company to expand and grow: in 1991, Odwalla's revenue was $9&nbsp;million, but five years later, Odwalla Inc. made $59&nbsp;million in sales. This strong growth made the company one of the largest fresh-juice companies in America in 1996,<ref name="deadly">{{cite web

===1996 ''E. coli'' outbreak===
====Safety issues prior to the outbreak====
The Odwalla plant had several minor food safety issues, many of which arose because Odwalla did not [[pasteurize]] its juice.<ref name="deadly"/> Tests discovered low levels of [[listeria monocytogenes]], a pathogen that can harm [[pregnant]] women, at the Odwalla factory in 1995.<ref>{{cite press release

The next year, Dave Stevenson, Odwalla's technical services director who oversaw quality assurance, suggested that Odwalla add a chlorine rinse to guard against bacteria on the skin of processed fruit, supplementing its existing phosphoric acid wash process. However, this plan was dropped by Chip Bettle, Odwalla's senior vice president, who feared that the chemicals would harm the fruit and alter the flavor of the juice.<ref name="deadly"/><ref name="questions">{{cite web

In a letter to ''[[The New York Times]]'' written on January 5, 1998, Odwalla's Director of Communications, Christopher C. Gallagher, wrote that "Odwalla continuously upgraded its manufacturing process in the period leading up to the recall. Moreover, our primary indicator of overall quality was daily bacteria-level readings, which were relatively low and decreasing in apple juice".<ref>{{cite web

====Outbreak and subsequent recall====
[[Image:E. Coli 0157.jpg|thumb|right|E. Coli 1057:H7]]
On October 30, 1996, health officials from the state of Washington informed Odwalla that they had found a link between an outbreak of the ''[[Escherichia coli O157:H7|E.&nbsp;coli&nbsp;O157:H7]]'' bacterium and a batch of Odwalla's fresh apple juice produced on October 7. This was confirmed on November 5, and may have resulted from using rotten fruit; one account tells of fruit being used that was highly decayed.<ref name="deadly"/> Another possible source of contamination was fallen apples ("grounders"), that had come into contact with animal [[feces]] and not been properly cleaned.<ref name="CNN1">{{cite web

To boost sales following the recall, Odwalla reformulated five products to remove their apple juice content, and released them in November 1996.<ref name="SEC"/> [[Flash pasteurization]] was introduced to the manufacturing process, and the juices reappeared on store shelves on December 5, 1996.
