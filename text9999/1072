'''Jimmy Roe''' ([[December 27]], [[1908]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] <U+2013> [[August 8]], [[1999]] in [[St. Charles, Missouri]]) was a U.S. [[soccer]] [[striker|inside left]] who spent his entire career in the St. Louis leagues.  He was called into the [[United States men's national soccer team|national team]] in 1937, but suffered a career ending knee injury before his first game with the team.  He was inducted into the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 1997.

==Youth==
Roe began playing organized soccer with his school, team St. Matthew School which was among the best teams in the St. Louis Catholic Youth Council.<ref>[http://webster.edu/~corbetre/genealogy/dad/soccer.html Bob Corbett<U+2019>s soccer biography]</ref>  After high school, he attended [[Christian Brothers College]] where he also played soccer.

==Professional==
In 1928, he joined Marres, a semi-professional team in the St. Louis Municipal (MUNY) League. The MUNY was the city<U+2019>s de facto second division, sitting below the professional [[St. Louis Soccer League]] (SLSL).  At some point, he moved to St. Matthew<U+2019>s.  In 1929, Row began the season with Russell Florists, but, according to the National Soccer Hall of Fame, he moved to [[Stix, Baer and Fuller F.C.]] (SBF) of the SLSL during the season.  This is not possible as SBF was not established until 1931.<ref>[http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/slsl.html St. Louis Soccer League]</ref>  In 1932, SBF went to the [[U.S. Open Cup]] final where it lost to the [[New Bedford Whalers]].<ref name="open">[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesu/usacuphist.html U.S. Open Cup at RSSSF]</ref>  The next year, Roe and his team mates ran off a string of Open Cup victories, taking the 1933 and 1934 titles.  Following the 1933 win, SBF played Toronto Scottish for the one time  North American Soccer Championship, which Scottish won 2-1.<ref>[http://www.soccer.on.ca/OSN.nsf/c1bfa845a2dec3bf85256b0b005d4116/37660183b53cc0328525714600531fe7?OpenDocument Canadian National Soccer Hall of Fame]</ref>  In 1934, St. Louis Central Breweries took over sponsorship of the team, renaming the it.  This did not stop Roe and his team mates from winning the 1935 Open Cup.  Central Breweries dropped its sponsorship in 1935 and the team competed as the independent [[St. Louis Shamrocks (1935-1938)|St. Louis Shamrocks]].  The Shamrocks went to the 1936 and 1937 Open Cup finals, but finished runner up in both.<ref name="open"/>

==National team==
In September 1937, Roe was called into the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. national team]] for a three game series with [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]].  However, he suffered a career ending injury before playing a minute.

Roe was inducted into the St. Louis Soccer Hall of Fame<ref>[http://eteamz.active.com/stlsoccerhalloffame/news/index.cfm?cat=466590 St. Louis Soccer Hall of Fame]</ref> and the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 1997.
