'''Chaubunagungamaug Reservation''' in [[Webster, Massachusetts]], was established in the 1680s for the group of [[Nipmuc]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] now known as the [[Webster, Massachusetts|Webster]]/[[Dudley, Massachusetts|Dudley]] Band of [[Chaubunagungamaug Nipmuck]]. 

For two centuries (the 1680s until the 1890s), this reservation supported a community of Nipmuck.  From the 1890s until the mid-1970s the Nipmuck presence on this land consisted of the Morse family and their immediate relatives.  From 1978 through the mid-1990s, the Chaubunagungamaug Band, as an organization, appears to have consisted, essentially, only of the extended '''Morse family'''. 

Together with the [[Hassanamisco Nipmuc]] of [[Grafton, Massachusetts]] and other families and individuals who identified as Nipmuc Indian, this group received recognition from the [[Massachusetts Commission on Indian Affairs]] in 1979.

Although the Nipmuck are recognized by the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]], in 2004 the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] decided that the Chaubunagungamaug Nipmuc group does not meet four of the seven mandatory requirements for [[U.S. Federal Government]] acknowledgment as a "nation".
