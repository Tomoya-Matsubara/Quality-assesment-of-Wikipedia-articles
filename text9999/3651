'''Taynton''' is a village and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] about {{convert|1.5|mi}} northwest of [[Burford]] in [[West Oxfordshire]]. The village is on Coombe Brook, a tributary of the [[River Windrush]]. The parish is bounded in the south by the River Windrush, in the north partly by Coombe Brook and its tributary Hazelden Brook, in the west by the county boundary with [[Gloucestershire]] and in the east by field boundaries.

==Manor==
In 1059 King [[Edward the Confessor]] granted the [[Manorialism|manor]] of Taynton to the [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of Saint Denis]] near [[Paris]].{{sfn|Salzman|1939|pp=373<U+2013>395}}<ref name=Salzman396>{{harvnb|Salzman|1939|pp=396<U+2013>428.}}</ref>{{sfn|Crossley|Currie|1996|pp=156<U+2013>158}}

The present [[manor house]] was built in the 17th century and has been much altered since.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=805}}

==Parish church==
The [[Church of England parish church]] of Saint [[John the Evangelist]] has a [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Decorated Gothic]] north [[Aisle#Architecture|aisle]] and [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] dating from about 1360.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=805}} The east window of the south aisle is also Decorated Gothic, but the present south arcade and the rest of the south aisle are [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular Gothic]] work from the end of the 15th century.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=805}} The [[clerestory]] of the [[nave]] was added at the same time.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=805}} The [[bell tower]] also is Perpendicular Gothic.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=805}} The architect [[William Ford Poulton|W.F.

==Economic and social history==
The [[Domesday Book]] records that in 1086 Taynton had two [[water mill]]s.{{sfn|Crossley|Currie|1996|pp=158<U+2013>165}} There is still a Taynton Mill in the Windrush valley downstream from Coombe Brook's confluence with the river. The Manor of Taynton's other mill may have been {{convert|14|mi}} away at [[Northmoor, Oxfordshire|Northmoor]], where the Manor of Taynton held land.{{sfn|Crossley|Currie|1996|pp=158<U+2013>165}}

===Taynton stone===
The Domesday Book records a quarry at Taynton.<ref name=Salzman396/>{{sfn|Arkell|1947|p=55}} The [[Taynton Limestone Formation]] is a [[Middle Jurassic]] [[Cotswold stone|Cotswold limestone]].{{sfn|Arkell|1947|p=31}} It is a high-quality [[Freestone (masonry)|freestone]] that for centuries has been used for [[ashlar]] and other precision masonry. The quarries, now all disused, are on the east side of the valley of Coombe Brook, starting {{convert|1/2|mi|m|sing=on}} north of the village and extending another {{convert|1+1/2|mi}} up the valley.{{sfn|Arkell|1947|loc=Fig. 8}}

The earliest record of a building using Taynton stone is from 1310, when it was used at [[Merton College, Oxford]].<ref name=Arkell61>{{harvnb|Arkell|1947|p=61.}}</ref> Taynton supplied stone for many of the older colleges of the [[University of Oxford]],<ref name=Sherwood804>{{harvnb|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=804.}}</ref> [[Windsor Castle]],<ref name=Sherwood804/> [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]]<ref name=Sherwood804/> and [[Eton College]].{{sfn|Lobel|1962|pp=27<U+2013>39}} The original statues around the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] in Oxford (carved in the 17th century and since replaced) were Taynton stone.{{sfn|Arkell|1947|p=63}}Early in the 18th century Taynton supplied some of the stone for [[Blenheim Palace]].<ref name=Sherwood804/> "Rally Quarr", almost {{convert|2|mi|0}} north of the village, is a corruption of "Railway Quarry".<ref name=Arkell57>{{harvnb|Arkell|1947|p=57.}}</ref> It was worked in 1846<U+2013>52 for stone to build bridges in the [[River Windrush|Windrush Valley]] for the [[Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway]].<ref name=Arkell57/>{{sfn|Arkell|1947|p=64}} Taynton stone was used in Oxford to widen [[Magdalen Bridge]] over the [[River Cherwell]] in 1882{{sfn|Arkell|1947|p=59}} and to build the New [[Bodleian Library]] in 1937<U+2013>39.{{sfn|Arkell|1947|pp=60<U+2013>61}} Stone was still being quarried in the parish in 1974.<ref name=Sherwood804/>

The navigability of the [[River Thames]] affected Taynton's ability to supply building stone. Originally the stone was taken {{convert|14|mi}} overland to [[Eynsham]] before being loaded onto barges.<ref name=Arkell61/> However, when Eton College was being built in the 15th century, navigation on the Upper Thames was so bad that stone was taken overland {{convert|40|mi}} to river wharves at [[Henley-on-Thames]].{{sfn|Lobel|1962|pp=27<U+2013>39}} In the 17th and 18th centuries the river was sometimes navigable upstream from Eynsham, so barges loaded the stone at [[Radcot]], {{convert|12|mi}} from Taynton.{{sfn|Arkell|1947|p=62}}

Despite transport limitations in earlier centuries, products from Taynton sometimes included substantial monoliths. In the 17th century [[Robert Plot]] recorded that [[Reade baronets#Reade baronets, of Barton (1661)|Sir Compton Reade]] had a stone [[Mashing#Mash tun|mash tun]] made at Taynton that measured {{convert/3 |6+3/8|x|3+3/8|x|4+1/2|ft|m|1}} and held about 65 [[bushel]]s<ref name=Arkell57/> (about 2,400 [[litre]]s). A team of 21 horses hauled it by road from Taynton to [[Shipton-under-Wychwood]],<ref name=Arkell57/> a distance of about {{convert|4|mi}}.

===Local buildings===
No. 16, or Strong's House, is a [[gable]]-fronted house with a date stone of 1676.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=805}} It was built for Thomas Strong, who was master mason to Sir [[Christopher Wren]].<ref name=EH-Strong>{{cite web |url= http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1183509 |title=Strongs House ''(sic)'' |work=National Heritage List for England |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref> It is a Grade II* listed building.<ref name=EH-Strong/>

As well as the manor house and Strong's House, a number of other houses in the village date from the 17th century. No. 5 is much restored but in its garden are two gothic stone window frames that may be mediaeval.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=805}}

The village school was built in 1877 and a post office had opened by 1895.{{sfn|Kelly|1895|p=285}} Neither remains open today.
