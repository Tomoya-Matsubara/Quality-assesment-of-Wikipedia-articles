'''Chlothar II''' (or ''Chlotar'', ''Clothar'', ''Clotaire'', ''Chlotochar'', or ''Hlothar'', giving rise to [[Lothair]]; [[584]] &ndash; [[629]]), called '''the Great''' (''le Grand'') or '''the Young''' (''le Jeune''), King of [[Neustria]], and, from [[613]] to [[629]], [[King of the Franks|King of all the Franks]], was not yet born when his father, King [[Chilperic I]] died in 584. His mother, [[Fredegund]], was regent until her death in [[597]], at which time the thirteen-year old Clotaire began to rule for himself.  As king, he continued his mother's feud with [[Brunhilda of Austrasia|Brunhilda]], queen of [[Austrasia]], with equal viciousness and bloodshed.

In [[599]], he made war with his cousins, [[Theuderic II]] of [[Burgundy]] and [[Theudebert II]] of Austrasia, who defeated him at [[Dormelles]] (near [[Montereau]]).  At this point, however, the two brothers took up arms against each other.  In [[605]], he invaded Theuderic's kingdom, but did not subdue it.  He remained often at war with Theuderic and the latter died in [[Metz]] in late [[613]] while preparing a campaign against him.  At that time, [[Warnachar]], [[mayor of the palace]] of Austrasia, and [[Rado (mayor of the palace)|Rado]], mayor of the palace of Burgundy, abandoned the cause of Brunhilda and her great-grandson, [[Sigebert II]], and the entire realm was delivered into Clotaire's hands.  Brunhilda and Sigebert met Clotaire's army on the [[Aisne]], but the Patrician Aletheus, Duke Rocco, and Duke Sigvald deserted the host and the grand old woman and her king had to flee.  As far as the [[Orbe]] they got, but Clotaire's minions caught up with them by the lake [[Neuch<U+00E2>tel]].  Both of them and Sigebert's younger brother Corbo were executed by Clotaire's orders.  

In that year, Clotaire II became the first king of all the [[Franks]] since his grandfather [[Clotaire I]] died in [[561]] by ordering the murder of the infant [[Sigebert II]] (son of Theuderic), whom the aging Brunhilda had attempted to set on the thrones of Austrasia and [[Burgundy]], causing a rebellion among the nobility.  This led to the delivery of Brunhilda into Clotaire's hands, his thirst for vengeance leading to his formidable old aunt enduring the agony of the [[rack]] for three whole days, before suffering a horrific death, chained between four horses that were goaded in separate directions, eventually tearing her apart.

In [[615]], Clotaire II promulgated the [[Edict of Paris]], a sort of Frankish [[Magna Carta]] that reserved many rights to the Frankish nobles while it [[anti-semitism|excluded Jews]] from all civil employment for the Crown.  The ban effectively placed all literacy in the [[Merovingian]] monarchy squarely under ecclesiastical control and also greatly pleased the nobles, from whose ranks the bishops were ordinarily exclusively drawn.  Clotaire was induced by Warnachar and Rado to make the mayoralty of the palace a lifetime appointment at [[Bonneuil-sur-Marne]], near [[Paris]], in [[617]].  By these actions, Clotaire lost his own legislative abilities and the great number of laws enacted in his reign are probably the result of the nobles' petitions, which the king had no authority not to heed.  

In [[623]], he gave the kingdom of [[Austrasia]] to his young son [[Dagobert I]]. This was a political move as repayment for the support of Bishop [[Arnulf of Metz]] and  [[Pepin I]], mayor of the palace of Austrasia, the two leading Austrasian nobles, who were effectively granted semi-autonomy.

Clotaire II died in 629 after 45 years on the throne, longer than any other Merovingian dynast.  He left the crown greatly reduced in power and prepared the way for the rise of the mayors and the ''rois fain<U+00E9>ants''.
