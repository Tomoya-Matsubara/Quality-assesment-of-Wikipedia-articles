'''Edmund Gerald "Pat" Brown, Sr.''' (April 21, 1905 <U+2013> February 16, 1996) was the 32nd [[Governor of California]], serving from 1959 to 1967, and the father of current Governor of California [[Jerry Brown]].

==Background==
Brown was born in [[San Francisco, California]], one of four children of Edmund and Ida Schuckman Brown. His father was an [[Irish Catholic]], his mother a [[German American|German]] [[Protestant]].<ref name="nyt obit">{{cite news|last=Reinhold|first=Robert|title=Edmund G.

When he was 12 and selling [[Liberty Bonds]] on street corners, he would end his spiel with, "Give me liberty, or give me death."<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2Tg--IiepQ&feature=related</ref>

He was a debate champion as a member of the [[Lowell Forensic Society]] at San Francisco's [[Lowell High School]], from which he graduated in 1923. Brown skipped college and worked in his father's cigar store while studying law at a local night school. He graduated from [[San Francisco Law School|San Francisco College of Law]] in spring 1927, passed the California bar exam the following fall,<ref>{{harvnb|Rarick|2006|p=17}}</ref> and started a law practice in San Francisco.

Brown ran as a Republican for the State Assembly in 1928, but lost; he joined the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] in 1932. He waited until 1939 to seek public office again, this time running for [[District Attorney]] of San Francisco, a race he lost to [[Matthew Brady (district attorney)|Matthew Brady]].<ref name="nyt obit"/>

He ran again for District Attorney in 1943, and this time won. He served in that position for seven years, and made his name attacking [[bookies]] and underground [[abortion]] providers{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}. In 1949, he raided [[Sally Stanford]]'s elegant San Francisco [[bordello]].<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/12/19/SC14MYF.DTL SFGate.com 19 December 1999]</ref>

In 1946, as the Democratic nominee, Brown lost the race for [[California Attorney General|Attorney General of California]] to Los Angeles County District Attorney [[Frederick N. Howser]]. Running again in 1950, he won election as Attorney General and was re-elected in 1954. While he was Attorney General, he was the only Democrat to win statewide election in California.

==Governor of California==
[[File:William Knowland, Edmund Brown Newsreel.ogv|thumb|left|180px|Newsreel of Attorney General Edmund G. Brown, running unopposed for the 1958 Democratic nomination]]
In 1958, he was the Democratic nominee for Governor of California.  He defeated U.S. Senator [[William F. Knowland]] by a margin of nearly 20 percentage points and a plurality of over 1 million votes. He was reelected in 1962, defeating former [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]] by 52% to 47%. He lost the 1966 election to another future [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[President of the United States|President]], [[Ronald Reagan]].  Reagan unseated Brown with 58%, winning a plurality of some 990,000 votes.

Brown's two terms were marked by an enormous water-resources development program. The [[California Aqueduct]] built as part of the program  now bears his name. He also presided over the enactment of the [[California Master Plan for Higher Education]], fair employment legislation, a state economic development commission, and a consumers' council.  He sponsored some forty major proposals, only five of which failed to pass in the Legislature.

Brown commuted 23 death sentences (the first time in his second day after taking office)<ref name="NYT 1999">{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Anthony|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2DE1F3CF933A1575BC0A96F948260|title=He was their last resort|work=The New York Times|date=August 20, 1989|accessdate=November 14, 2010}}</ref>, including a commutation for [[Erwin Walker|Erwin "Machine-Gun" Walker]].  Brown allowed 36 executions, including the highly controversial case of [[Caryl Chessman]] in 1960 and [[Elizabeth Duncan]] - the last female put to death before a national moratorium was instituted.<ref name="NYT 1999">{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Anthony|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2DE1F3CF933A1575BC0A96F948260|title=He was their last resort|work=The New York Times|date=August 20, 1989|accessdate=November 14, 2010}}</ref>  Brown himself opposed the death penalty<ref>[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/archives_exhibits/masterplan/bios.html The History of the California Master Plan for Higher Education: Biographical Glossary]</ref>

During the Chessman case he also proposed that the death penalty be abolished, but the proposal failed.<ref name="NYT 1999"/> His [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] successor, [[Ronald Reagan]], was a firm death penalty supporter and oversaw the last [[Furman v. Georgia|pre-Furman]] execution in California in 1967.

== Personal life ==
Brown and his wife, Bernice (n<U+00E9>e Layne), the daughter of a [[San Francisco]] police captain, were childhood sweethearts. They married in 1930 and had four children (all born in [[San Francisco]]): 

* Barbara Layne Brown [Casey] (July 13, 1931&mdash;)
* Cynthia Arden Brown [Kelly] (October 19, 1933&mdash;)
* [[Jerry Brown|Edmund Gerald ("Jerry") Brown, Jr.]] (April 7, 1938&mdash;)
* [[Kathleen Brown|Kathleen Lynn Brown]] (September 25, 1945&mdash;)

In 1970, Pat's son Jerry Brown was elected Secretary of State of California; in 1974 he was elected as the 34th [[Governor of California]]. Re-elected Governor in 1978, Jerry Brown was defeated in a bid for the [[U.S. Senate]] in 1982, served as mayor of [[Oakland]] from 1998<U+2013>2006 and was elected California Attorney General in 2006; he was again elected Governor in 2010. Kathleen Brown was elected [[California State Treasurer]] in 1990 and was defeated in a bid for Governor of California in 1994.

In 1958, as Governor-elect, Pat Brown appeared as a guest challenger on the TV panel show "What's My Line?"

Pat Brown died at age 90 in [[Beverly Hills]] and is interred at [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Colma|Holy Cross Cemetery]] in [[Colma]].

{{cquote|My son asked me what I hoped to accomplish as Governor. I told him: essentially to make life more comfortable for people, as far as government can.  I think that embraces everything from developing the water resources vital to California's growth, to getting a man to work and back fifteen minutes earlier if it can be done through a state highway program.}}

Unlike his son, Jerry, Pat Brown never seriously ran for [[President of the United States]], but he frequently was California's "[[favorite son]]", running exclusively in his home state.

During the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952 Democratic primaries]] Brown placed distant second to [[Estes Kefauver]] in total votes (65.04% to 9.97%),<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=55191 ourcampaigns.com]</ref> losing California to Kefauver.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=35874 ourcampaigns.com]</ref>

During Governor Brown's first term (1959<U+2013>1963), the national census confirmed that California had become the nation's most populous state.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/InfoLinkDetail.html?InfoLinkID=1811</ref>  Brown's political popularity, multiplied by the state's population, would contribute to the following two national Presidential victories, when he pledged his votes to the national candidates, (Kennedy in 1960, and Johnson in 1964), at the Democratic conventions.

While Governor, Brown was again California's favorite son [[United States presidential election, 1960|in 1960]], winning his home state with a large margin to his only opponent [[George H. McLain]].<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=35944 Our Campaigns - CA US President - D Primary Race - Jun 07, 1960<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> Brown joined favorite sons Ohio's [[Albert S. Porter]], [[Governor of Ohio|Governor]] [[Michael DiSalle]] and [[Florida]] Senator [[George Smathers]].  

More serious primary candidates were [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], [[Hubert Humphrey]], [[Adlai Stevenson II]] and [[Stuart Symington]] in 1960, with the nomination going to [[John F. Kennedy]]. Brown ran only in the California state primary. Yet his popularity with the largest state electorate in the nation gave him second place in the national Democratic primary vote, just behind Kennedy.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=55200 Our Campaigns - US President - D Primaries Race - Feb 01, 1960<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> Thus he repeated his 1952 state and national rankings. However, only one delegate cast his vote for Brown for President at the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]].<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=58375 Our Campaigns - US President - D Convention Race - Jul 11, 1960<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>

During the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 primaries]], by running again only in California, the nation's largest state electorate vote<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=35980 ourcampaigns.com]</ref> led Brown to place first this time in both the California and the Democratic national primary total,<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=55202 ourcampaigns.com]</ref> besting the eventual nominee. Brown, as well as over a dozen other candidates except [[George Wallace]], was a [[stalking horse]] for [[incumbent]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], whose nomination was assured.

As for the [[VPOTUS|Vice Presidency]], he briefly sought nomination at the [[1956 Democratic National Convention]], winning one vote.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=59952 Our Campaigns - US Vice President - D Convention Race - Aug 13, 1956<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>

==Political party identity in California==

Prior to 1959, loyalty to a political party was not important in California.  Through a practice known as [[cross-filing]], a person could run in both the Democratic primary and the Republican primary at the same time.  As indicated in the article on the [[California Democratic Party]], Governor [[Earl Warren]] did so in 1946 and 1950.  Cross-filing was abolished in 1959.  Thus the fact that Brown first ran for office as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and later as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] was not, at that time, as significant in California as it would have been elsewhere.
