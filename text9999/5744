Steno was trained in the classical texts on science; however, by 1659 he seriously questioned accepted knowledge of the natural world.<ref>{{harvnb|Kooijmans|2007}}</ref> Importantly he questioned explanations for tear production, the idea that fossils grew in the ground and explanations of rock formation. His investigations and his subsequent conclusions on fossils and rock formation have led scholars to consider him one of the founders of modern [[stratigraphy]] and modern geology.<ref>{{harvnb|Wyse Jackson|2007}}</ref><ref name="Woods">{{harvnb|Woods|2005|pp=4 & 96}}</ref>

Born to a Lutheran family, Steno converted to Catholicism in 1667. After his conversion, his interest for natural sciences rapidly waned giving way to his interest in theology.<ref>{{harvnb|Garrett Winter|1916|pp=180, 182}}</ref> At the beginning of 1675, he decided to become a priest. Four months after, he was [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|ordained]] in the Catholic clergy in Easter 1675. As a clergyman, he was later appointed by [[Pope Innocent XI]] [[Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Germany|Vicar Apostolic of Nordic Missions]]  and [[Titopolis|Titular Bishop of Titopolis]]. Steno played an active role in the [[Counter-Reformation]] in Northern Germany. He was [[Veneration|venerated as a saint]] after his death and the [[Canonization|Roman Catholic canonization process]] was begun in 1938. [[Pope John Paul II]] [[beatification|beatified]] Steno in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beatifications By Pope John Paul II, 1979<U+2013>2000|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_list_blesseds-jp-ii_en.html|publisher=Holy See|accessdate=11 January 2012|author=Office Of Papal Liturgical Celebrations}}</ref>

==Early life and career==
[[File:Portrait of Nicolas Stenonus.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Portrait of Nicolas Steno (1666<U+2013>1677). Unsigned but attributed to court painter [[Justus Sustermans]]. ([[Uffizi Gallery]], Florence, Italy)<ref>{{harvnb|Hansen|2009|p=161}}</ref>]]
Nicolas Steno ({{lang-da|Niels Stensen}}; [[Latinization (literature)|Latinized]] to ''Nicolaus Stenonis'' or ''Nicolaus Stenonius''{{#tag:ref|Also known as Nikolaus or Nils Steensen, Stens.<ref name=NewCathEncy/> Steno took his surname from his father's given name. In accordance with the academic customs of his time, Nicolas latinized the Danish form of his name Niels Ste(e)nsen as Nicolaus Stenonis. The English form, ''Steno'', is due to an error in parsing the Latin.<ref>{{harvnb|Garrett Winter|1916|p=175}}</ref> |group=notes}}) was born in [[Copenhagen]] on New Year's Day 1638 ([[Julian calendar]]), the son of a [[Lutheran]] [[goldsmith]] who worked regularly for King [[Christian IV of Denmark]]. Suffering from an unknown disease, he grew up in isolation during his childhood. In 1644 his father died, after which his mother married another goldsmith. In 1654<U+2013>1655, 240 pupils of his school died because of the [[Black Death|plague]]. Across the street lived [[Peder Griffenfeld|Peder Schumacher]] (who would offer Steno a post as professor in Copenhagen in 1671). At the age of 19, Steno entered the [[University of Copenhagen]] to pursue medical studies.<ref>{{harvnb|Kermit|2002}}</ref> After completing his university education, Steno set out to travel through Europe; in fact, he would be on the move for the rest of his life. In the Netherlands, France, Italy and Germany he came into contact with prominent physicians and scientists. These influences led him to use his own powers of observation to make important scientific discoveries. At a time when scientific questions were mostly answered by appeal to ancient authorities, Steno was bold enough to trust his own eyes, even when his observations differed from traditional doctrines.

At the urging of [[Thomas Bartholin]], Steno first travelled to [[Rostock]], then to [[Amsterdam]], where he studied anatomy under and lodged at [[Gerard Blasius]], focusing on the [[Lymphatic system]].  Within a few months Steno moved to Leiden, where he met the students [[Jan Swammerdam]], [[Frederik Ruysch]], [[Reinier de Graaf]], [[Franciscus Sylvius|Franciscus de le Boe Sylvius]], a famous professor, and [[Baruch Spinoza]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kooijmans|2004|p=53}}. See [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/kooi020dood01_01/kooi020dood01_01_0003.php]</ref> At the time [[Ren<U+00E9> Descartes|Descartes]] was publishing on the working of the [[Human brain|brain]], and Steno did not think his explanation of the origin of tears<ref>{{cite web|last=Ren<U+00E9>|first=Descartes|title=The Origin of Tears|url=http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdf/descpass.pdf|work=The Passions of the Soul|publisher=Jonathan Bennett|accessdate=11 January 2012}}</ref> produced by the brain was correct. He travelled to Paris where he was invited by [[Henri Louis Habert de Montmor]] and [[Pierre Bourdelot]], and met [[Ole Borch]] and [[Melchis<U+00E9>dech Th<U+00E9>venot]] who were all interested in new research and demonstrations of his skills. In 1665 Stensen travelled to [[Saumur]], Bordeaux and [[Montpellier]], where he met [[Martin Lister]] and [[William Croone]], who introduced Steno's work to the [[Royal Society]].

After travelling through France, he settled in Italy in 1666. At first as professor of anatomy at the [[University of Padua]] and then in Florence as in-house physician of [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke of Tuscany Ferdinando II de' Medici]], who supported arts and science and whom Steno had met in [[Pisa]].<ref name=EB1911/> Steno was invited to live in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], in return he had to gather a [[Cabinet of curiosities]]. Steno went to Rome and met [[Pope Alexander VII]] and [[Marcello Malpighi]], who he admired. On his way back he watched a [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpu Christi]] procession in [[Livorno]] and wondered if he had the right belief.<ref>Kooijmans, L. (2007) Gevaarlijke kennis, p. 99-100.</ref> In [[Florence]] Steno focused on the [[muscular system]] and the nature of [[muscle contraction]]. He became a member of [[Accademia del Cimento]] and had long discussions with [[Francesco Redi]]. Like [[Vincenzio Viviani]], Steno proposed a geometrical model of muscles to show that a contracting muscle changes its shape but not its [[volume]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kardel|1990}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Kardel|1994|p=1}}</ref>

==Scientific contributions==
[[File:Stenoshark.jpg|thumb|175px|Illustration from Steno's 1667 paper comparing the teeth of a shark head with a fossil tooth]]

===Anatomy===
{{main|Parotid duct}}
During his stay in Amsterdam, Steno discovered a previously undescribed structure, the "''[[Parotid duct|ductus stenonianus]]''" (the duct of the [[Parotid gland|parotid salivary gland]]) in sheep, dog and rabbit heads. A dispute with Blasius over credit for the discovery arose, but Steno's name remained associated with this structure known today as the [[parotid duct|Stensen's duct]].<ref>{{harvnb |Kermit | 2003}}</ref> In Leiden, Steno studied the boiled [[heart]] of a cow, and determined that it was an ordinary [[muscle]]<ref>{{harvnb|Tubbs et al.|2010}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Andrault|2010}}</ref> and not the center of warmth as [[Galenus]] and Descartes believed.<ref>Kooijmans (2007), p. 45.</ref>

===Paleontology===
In October 1666 two fishermen caught a huge female [[shark]] near the town of [[Livorno]], and [[Ferdinando II de' Medici]], Grand Duke of Tuscany, ordered its head to be sent to Steno. Steno [[dissection|dissected]] the head and published his findings in 1667. He noted that the [[Shark tooth|shark's teeth]] bore a striking resemblance to certain stony objects, found embedded within rock formations, that his learned contemporaries were calling ''glossopetrae'' or "tongue stones". Ancient authorities, such as the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] author [[Pliny the Elder]], in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'', had suggested that these stones fell from the sky or from the [[Moon]]. Others were of the opinion, also following ancient authors, that [[fossil]]s naturally grew in the rocks. Steno's contemporary [[Athanasius Kircher]], for example, attributed fossils to a "lapidifying virtue diffused through the whole body of the geocosm", considered an inherent characteristic of the earth <U+2013> an [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] approach. [[Fabio Colonna]], however, had already shown in a convincing way that ''glossopetrae'' are shark teeth,<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070318025357/http://www.musei.unina.it/Paleontologia/3.2.3.htm Breve storia della paleontologia], internet site of Centro dei Musei di Scienze Naturali, university of Naples Retrieved 10 January 2012</ref> in his treaty ''De glossopetris dissertatio'' published in 1616.<ref>{{harvnb|Abbona|2002|loc=Geologia}}. Colonna had been schooled in the collection of [[Ferrante Imperato]], apothecary and ''virtuoso'' of Naples, who published his natural history notes in 1599</ref> Steno added to Colonna's theory a discussion on the differences in composition between glossopetrae and living sharks' teeth, arguing that the chemical composition of fossils could be altered without changing their form, using the contemporary [[Corpuscularianism|corpuscular theory of matter]].

Steno's work on shark teeth led him to the question of how any solid object could come to be found inside another solid object, such as a rock or a layer of rock. The "solid bodies within solids" that attracted Steno's interest included not only fossils, as we would define them today, but minerals, crystals, encrustations, veins, and even entire rock layers or [[stratum|strata]]. He published his geologic studies in ''De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento dissertationis prodromus'', or ''Preliminary discourse to a dissertation on a solid body naturally contained within a solid'' in 1669. This book was his last scientific work of note.<ref name="Garrett1916">{{harvnb|Garrett Winter|1916|p=182}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|[[Leibnitz]] came to know and esteem Steno in Hannover and expressed deep regrets that Steno had abandoned his earlier studies.<ref>{{harvnb|Garrett Winter|1916|pp=182}}</ref>|group=notes}} Steno was not the first to identify fossils as being from living organisms; his contemporaries [[Robert Hooke]] and [[John Ray]] also argued that fossils were the remains of once-living organisms.

===Geology and stratigraphy===
[[File:Steno-prodomus-1969.jpg|thumb|175px|''De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento dissertationis prodromus'' (1669)]]
{{main|law of superposition|principle of original horizontality|principle of lateral continuity}}
Steno, in his ''Dissertationis prodromus'' of 1669 is credited with three of the defining principles of the science of [[stratigraphy]]: the [[law of superposition]]: "...&nbsp;at the time when any given stratum was being formed, all the matter resting upon it was fluid, and, therefore, at the time when the lower stratum was being formed, none of the upper strata existed";  the [[principle of original horizontality]]: "Strata either perpendicular to the horizon or inclined to the horizon were at one time parallel to the horizon"; the [[principle of lateral continuity]]: "Material forming any stratum were continuous over the surface of the Earth unless some other solid bodies stood in the way"; and the [[principle of cross-cutting relationships]]: "If a body or discontinuity cuts across a stratum, it must have formed after that stratum."<ref name=brook>{{harvnb|Brookfield|2004|p=116}}</ref> These principles were applied and extended in 1772 by [[Jean-Baptiste L. Rom<U+00E9> de l'Isle]]. Steno's ideas still form the basis of stratigraphy and were key in the development of [[James Hutton]]'s theory of [[James Hutton#Search for evidence|infinitely repeating cycles]] of seabed deposition, uplifting, erosion, and submersion.<ref name=brook/>

Steno's landmark theory that the fossil record was a chronology of different living creatures in different eras was a ''[[sine qua non]]'' for Darwin's theory of [[natural selection]].

===Crystallography===
{{Details|Crystal system|crystallographic indices}}
Steno gave the first accurate observations on a type of crystal in his 1669 book ''"De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento"''.<ref name=kunz/> The principle in [[crystallography]], known simply as ''Steno's law'', or ''Steno's law of constant angles'', states that the angles between corresponding faces on crystals are the same for all specimens of the same mineral. Steno's seminal work paved the way for the law of the rationality of the [[Crystal system|crystallographic indices]] of French mineralogist [[Ren<U+00E9>-Just Ha<U+00FC>y]] in 1801.<ref name=kunz>{{harvnb|Kunz|1918}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/eens211/introsymmetry.pdf |title=Stephen A. Nelson, (Tulane U.) "Introduction to Earth Materials" |format=PDF |accessdate=11 January 2012}}</ref> This fundamental breakthrough formed the basis of all subsequent inquiries into [[crystal structure]].

==Religious studies==
Steno's questioning mind also influenced his religious views. Having been brought up in the [[Lutheran]] faith, he nevertheless questioned its teachings, something which became a burning issue when confronted with Roman Catholicism while studying in [[Florence]]. After making comparative theological studies, including reading the Church Fathers and by using his natural observational skills, he decided that Catholicism, rather than Lutheranism, provided more sustenance for his constant inquisitiveness. In 1667, Steno converted to Catholicism on [[All Souls' Day]] when Lavinia Cenami Arnolfini, a noblewoman of [[Lucca]], insisted.<ref name=cathhier/><ref>{{cite web|title=Niels Stensen|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/2052.html|work=Whonamedit? A dictionary of medical eponyms|accessdate=11 January 2011}}</ref>

Steno traveled to Hungary, Austria and in Spring 1670 he arrived in Amsterdam. There he met with old friends [[Jan Swammerdam]] and [[Reinier de Graaf]]. With [[Anna Maria van Schurman]] and [[Antoinette Bourignon]] he discussed scientific and religious topics. The following quote is from a 1673 speech:
:''Fair is what we see, Fairer what we have perceived, Fairest what is still in veil''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stenomuseet.dk/engelsk/mellem.htm |title=Pulchra sunt, quae videntur pulchriora quae sciuntur longe pulcherrima quae ignorantur. From a 1673 speech for the Copenhagen Anatomical Theatre |publisher=Stenomuseet.dk |accessdate=11 January 2012}}</ref>
It is not clear if he met [[Nicolaes Witsen]], but he did read Witsen's book on shipbuilding. In 1671 he accepted the post of professor of anatomy in the University of Copenhagen,<ref name=EB1911>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Steno, Nicolaus|url=}}</ref> but promised [[Cosimo III de' Medici]] he would return when he was appointed tutor to [[Ferdinando III de' Medici]].

At the beginning of 1675, Steno decided to continue his theological studies, which he had begun even before his conversion, toward his ordination to the priesthood.<ref name=kraus35/> After only 4 months, he was ordained priest  and celebrated his first mass on 13 April 1675 in the Basilica of the [[Santissima Annunziata, Florence|Santissima Annunziata]] in Florence at the age of 37.<ref name=NewCathEncy/><ref name=cathhier>{{cite web|title=Bishop Bl. Niels Stensen|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bstensen.html|work=Catholic Hierarchy|accessdate=11 January 2012}}</ref><ref name=kraus35/> [[Athanasius Kircher]] expressly asked what were the reasons why he decided to become priest.<ref name=kraus35>{{harvnb|Kraus|2011|p=35}}</ref> Steno had left natural sciences for education and theology and became one of the leading figures in the [[Counter-Reformation]].<ref name="Garrett1916" /> Upon request of Duke [[John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick-L<U+00FC>neburg|Johann Friedrich of Hanover]], [[Pope Innocent XI]] made him [[Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Germany#Vicars Apostolic for the Nordic Missions|Vicar Apostolic for the Nordic Missions]] on 21 August 1677.  He was consecrated [[bishop of Titiopolis|titular bishop of Titiopolis]] on 19 September by [[Cardinal Barbarigo]] and moved to the Lutheran North.<ref name=Miniati77>{{harvnb|Miniati|2009|loc=Note 26, p.77}}</ref>

In the year after he was made bishop, he was probably involved in the banning of publications by [[Spinoza]],<ref>{{harvnb|Israel|2002|pp=251, 316}}</ref> There he had talks with [[Gottfried Leibniz]], the librarian; the two argued about [[Spinoza]] and his letter to [[Albert Burgh]], then Steno's pupil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticfiles.org/atheist/spinozad.htm |title=Skeptic files website |publisher=Skepticfiles.org |accessdate=11 January 2012}}</ref> Leibniz recommended a reunification of the churches. Steno worked at the city of [[Hannover]] until 1680.

After John Frederick death's, [[Prince-Bishop of Paderborn]] [[Ferdinand of F<U+00FC>rstenberg]] appointed him as Auxiliary [[Bishop of M<U+00FC>nster]] (Church Saint Liudger) on 7 October 1680.<ref name=NewCathEncy/> The new [[prince-elector]] [[Ernest Augustus, Elector of Hanover]] was a Protestant. Earlier, Augustus' wife, [[Sophia of Hanover]], had made fun of Steno's piousness; he had sold his bishop's ring and cross to help the needy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} He continued zealously the work of counter reform begun by [[Bernhard von Galen]].<ref name=NewCathEncy/>

In 1683, Steno resigned as auxiliary bishop after an argument about the election of the new bishop, [[Maximilian Henry of Bavaria]] and moved in 1684 to [[Hamburg]].<ref name=cathhier /> There Steno became involved again in the study of the brain and the nerve system with an old friend [[Dirck Kerckring]].<ref>{{harvnb|Perrini|Lanzino|Parent|2010}}</ref> Steno was invited to [[Schwerin]], when it became clear he was not accepted in Hamburg. Steno dressed like a poor man in an old cloak. He drove in an open carriage in snow and rain. Living four days a week on bread and beer, he became emaciated.<ref group=notes>On the other days there were never more than four courses plus a dessert, even though noblemen from the court often dined with him.</ref> When Steno had fulfilled his mission, some years of difficult tasks, he wanted to go back to Italy. Before he could return, Steno became severely ill, his belly swelling day by day. Steno died in Germany, after much suffering. His corpse was shipped to Florence by Kerckring upon request of [[Cosimo III de' Medici]] and buried in the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|Basilica of San Lorenzo]] close to his protectors, the [[De' Medici]] family.<ref name=NewCathEncy /> In 1946 his grave was opened,<ref>Nicolai Stenonis epistolae et epistolae ad eum datae quas cum prooemio ac notis germanice scriptis edidit Gustav Scherz. 2 tom, p. 997. Kopenhagen und Freiburg, Nordisk Forlag und Herder, 1952.</ref> and the corpse was reburied after a procession through the streets of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://himetop.wikidot.com/niels-stensen-chapel-in-san-lorenzo |title=Niels Stensen chapel in San Lorenzo <U+2013> Himetop |publisher=Himetop.wikidot.com |date=21 March 2010 |accessdate=11 January 2012}}</ref>

==Beatification==
After his death in 1686, Steno was venerated as a saint in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hildesheim|diocese of Hildesheim]].<ref name=NewCathEncy/> Steno's piety and virtue have been evaluated with a view to an eventual [[canonization]]. His canonization process was begun in [[Osnabr<U+00FC>ck]] in 1938.<ref name=NewCathEncy/> In 1953 his grave in the crypt of the church of San Lorenzo was opened as part of the beatification process.<ref name=kermit21>{{harvnb|Kermit|2002|p=21}}</ref> His corpse was transferred to a fourth-century Christian sarcophagus found in the river [[Arno]] donated by the Italian state. His remains were placed in a lateral chapel of the church that received the name of ''"Capella Stenoniana"''.<ref name=NewCathEncy>{{harvnb|Scherz|2002}}</ref><ref name=kermit21/> He was [[Beatification|declared "beatus"]]&nbsp;<U+2014> the third of four steps to being declared a [[saint]]&nbsp;<U+2014> by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1988. He is thus now called by Catholics ''Blessed Nicolas Steno.'' His feast day is 5 December.<ref name=NewCathEncy/>
