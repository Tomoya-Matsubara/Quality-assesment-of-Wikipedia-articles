==Plot==
The episode starts by having [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]'s class going on a field trip to the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]]. On the bus, Bart must sit next to Wendell, a child who has very horrible motion sickness. Bart's teacher gives him warnings about moaning about this, and Bart is told, if he makes one more outburst, he will be forced to sing in front of the class. Sherri and Terri, two schoolchildren sitting behind Bart, both kiss him, forcing him to yell out, and causing Bart to be forced to sing. When Springfield Elementary gets off the bus, Wendell proceeds to throw up. 

The class enters the power plant, and are met by [[Waylon Smithers|Smithers]], who shows them a video on Nuclear Energy. After the video, Smithers takes them into a working sector, where Blinky, the three eyed fish, is seen in a stream outside of the plant. As the class is walking through the plant, they see [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], who causes an accident by waving to Bart. Homer is then fired for the accident. 

Unable to find a job, Homer sees a commercial for Duff beer. When there is no beer in the fridge, Homer breaks Bart's piggy bank, only to realize what a monster he has become. He decides to commit [[suicide]], as he believes the family would be better off without him. He writes a final letter and begins to carry a large boulder to a lake. Meanwhile, Bart and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] wake up and inform [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] that they have been robbed. Later realizing Homer is gone, the family goes out to the lake, where they see Homer about to kill himself. When they all step into a street, a car almost kills them, but Homer saves them by pushing the entire family out of the way of the oncoming car. Homer realizes he cares not only for the safety of his family, but the safety of the public as well. 

Homer decides he will protest to city hall to put up a stop sign at the intersection his family was almost killed at. When it successfully passes, Homer proceeds to add many other signs, "Speed Bump" and "Sign Ahead." However, he soon grows tired of just promoting traffic safety, and tries to get [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] to shut down the nuclear power plant. 

Nervous, [[Mr. Burns]] lures Homer to his office, where he is offered a job as safety inspector at the plant, with a large pay raise included. After much hesitation, Homer agrees, and tells his growing mass of supporters he can no longer continue his crusade for public safety, urging them to carry on instead while he makes sure the plant is safe.<ref name="bbc"/><ref name="wdbg">{{cite web|url=http://www.wdbgproductions.com/cinerama/reviews/simpsonsseason1.htm|title=The Simpsons: The Complete First Season|accessdate=2008-07-20|author=Grelck, David B |date=2003|publisher=WDBG Productions}}</ref>

==Production==
[[Image:Smithers.jpg|left|thumb|"Black Smithers", as seen in this episode]]
Smithers was mistakenly animated with the wrong color and was made [[African-American|black]] by Gyorgi Peluci, the color stylist. [[David Silverman]] has claimed that Smithers was always intended to be "Mr Burns' white sycophant,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://72.14.205.104/search?q=cache:VXGKpegLb2MJ:www.hurtwoodmedia.com/mckenzie/pdf/simpsons.pdf|title=Background Guide to The Simpsons|accessdate=2007-10-25|date=September 2002|publisher=Hurtwood Media}}</ref> and the staff thought it "would be a bad idea to have a black sub-servient character" and so switched him to his intended color for his next episode.<ref>{{cite news|title=Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves|date=[[2000-10-21]]|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|author=Joe Rhodes}}</ref>
This is the episode where [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] becomes the Safety Inspector at the plant, his previous job is unclear, though he calls himself a "technical supervisor". He was hired as part of "Project Bootstrap," a [[fictional]] government program to bring in unskilled workers implemented by the [[Ford administration]].

Blinky the three-eyed fish also makes a brief cameo in this episode, he later becomes of importance in "[[Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish]]". Also notable is that Marge was originally called Juliette in this script as an homage to ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.<ref name="Wolodarsky">{{cite video | people=Wolodarsky, Wallace|year=2001|title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Odyssey"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>
This is also the first mention of Homer's middle initial J., a reference to [[Bullwinkle J. Moose]].<ref name="Groening">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|year=2001|title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Odyssey"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>
