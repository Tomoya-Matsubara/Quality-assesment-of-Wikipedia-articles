'''''Black Sabbath''''' ({{lang-it|I tre volti della paura}}) is a 1963 Italian-French [[horror film]] directed by [[Mario Bava]]. The film is centered on three separate tales that have an introduction and conclusion from [[Boris Karloff]]. The film stars an international cast in three short stories. The first, titled "The Telephone", involves Suzy ([[Mich<U+00E8>le Mercier]]) who continually receives threatening telephone calls from an unseen stalker. The second is "The Wurdulak", where a man named Gorca (Karloff) returns to his family after claiming to have slain a Wurdulak, an undead creature who attacks those that it had once loved. The third story, "The Drop of Water", features Jacqueline Pierreux as Helen Corey who steals a ring from a corpse that is being prepared for burial only to find herself haunted by the ring's original owner after arriving home.

''Black Sabbath'' follows the 1960s trend of Italian film productions being both a low budget horror and anthology film with an international cast. The film is credited to various authors but is predominantly based on several unaccredited sources. Several changes were made from to the script even after the film had gone into production. [[American International Pictures]] had a member of their staff suggest changes for Mario Bava to make the film acceptable for the American target audience. The company created their own English language dub of the film that removed scenes involving violence and changed certain editing and takes used in the film. This version also greatly changed the plot of "The Telephone" giving it a supernatural story and removing any reference to lesbianism or prostitution.

A follow-up to ''Black Sabbath'' titled ''Scarlet Friday'' was originally going to be directed by Bava and star Boris Karloff. This project was never developed. Plans for a remake were announced in 2004 with [[Jonathan Hensleigh]] attached to write the script. ''Black Sabbath'' has received favorable reviews from critics. In the early 2010s, ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors, and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. ''Black Sabbath'' placed at number 73.

== Plot ==
:''Note: This plot summary refers to the original Italian version of the film''

=== "The Telephone" ===
Rosy ([[Michele Mercier]]), a French call-girl returns to her basement apartment at night when she receives a series of strange phone calls. The caller soon identifies himself as Frank, her ex-pimp who has recently escaped from prison. Rosy is terrified, as it was her testimony that landed Frank in jail. Looking for solace, Rosy phones Mary (Lydia Alfonsi). The two women have been estranged, but Rosy is certain that only she can help her. Mary agrees to come over that night. Seconds later, Frank calls again, promising that no matter what Rosy does, he will have his revenge. Unknown to Rosy, Mary is the caller impersonating Frank. Mary arrives at Rosy's apartment soon after and attempts to calm Rosy's nerves and provides Mary with a large knife for protection before she goes to sleep.

As Rosy sleeps, Mary writes a confession that she was making the calls. Knowing that Rosy would call on her for help, she explains that she felt it was her way reuniting with her. While writing, an intruder sneaks into the apartment. This intruder is revealed to be Frank who strangles Mary. The sound of their struggle awakens Rosy as Frank realizes he just murdered the wrong woman. Frank approaches Rosy's bed as she seizes her knife and stabs Frank. Rosy drops the knife and breaks down in hysteria.

=== "The Wurdalak" ===
In 19th Century Russia, Vladimir Durfe ([[Mark Damon]]) is a young nobleman who finds a beheaded corpse with a knife plunged into its heart. After taking the blade he finds a small cottage for shelter. Durfe is approached by Giorgio (Glauco Onorato) who explains that the knife belongs to his father, who has not been seen for five days. Giorgio offers a room to Durfe and introduces him to the rest of the family: his wife (Rika Dialina), their young son Ivan, Giorgio's younger brother Pietro (Massimo Righi), and sister Sdenka ([[Susy Andersen]]). They all await the return of Gorca, who has gone to fight the [[Wurdulac|wurdalak]], a living cadaver who feeds on human blood, especially of close friends and family members. At midnight, Gorca ([[Boris Karloff]]) returns to the cottage with a sour demeanor and unkempt appearance. After the family goes to sleep, Ivan and Pietro are attacked by Gorca who flees the cottage with Giorgio's son. Giorgio chases after Gorca but only returns with the corpse. Giorgio plans to stake and behead Pietro to prevent him from reviving as a Wurdalak, but is prevented from doing so by his wife. The two agree to give their son a burial.

That same night, their child appears outside and begs to be invited in. Giorgio is stabbed by his wife while she attempts to let in her son. On opening the door, she is greeted by Gorca who bites her. Vladimir and Sdenka flee from their home and hide out in the ruins of a cathedral. As Vladimir sleeps, Sdenka walks outside and finds Gorca and his family surrounding her. Vladimir awakens and searches for Sdenka, finding her lying motionless in her bed at home. Sdenka awakens and upon receiving Vladimir's embrace, she bites into his neck.

=== "The Drop of Water" ===
In London, England, Nurse Helen Chester (Jacqueline Pierreux) is called to a large house to prepare the corpse of an elderly medium for her burial. As she dresses the body, she notices a sapphire ring on its finger. Chester steals it and accidentally tips over a glass of water which drip on the floor as she is then assailed by a fly. Chester takes her ring home to her flat and becomes assailed by strange events. The fly returns and continues to pester her and the lights in her apartment go out as the sound of the dripping water continues from various locations in the house. After seeking the source of the sound, Chester finds the woman's corpse lying in her bed, rising up and floating towards her. Chester begs for forgiveness as the body approaches her, but ultimately strangles herself. The next morning, the concierge (Harriet White Medin) discovers Chester's body and calls the police. The pathologist arrive to examine the body and only find a small bruise on her left finger where her ring once was. As the doctor makes this observation, the concierge appears distressed and begins to hear the dripping of water.

===Development===
In 1958, [[American International Pictures]] founders [[James H. Nicholson]] and [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]] hired European talent agent Flavio Lucisano to look for Italian commercial films for them after the large success of the Italian feature ''[[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]]'' (1958).<ref name="bs-arrow-15">{{Cite AV media notes

== Reception ==
In a contemporary review of the American International Picture's edit, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' stated that "The Drop of Water" and "The Telephone" were "a good deal more sophisticated than usual horror fare" while "The Wurdulak" "bears no trace of [Bava's] manner of directing" and that the acting was "rudimentary".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Morriss |first=Frank |date=Jun 11, 1964 |title=Touch of Humor in Karloff Horror |journal=The Globe and Mail |location=Toronto, Ont. |page=11}}</ref> ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' gave the film a negative review, referring to the ''Black Sabbath'' as "three short films botched together".<ref>{{cite journal |date=May 21, 1964 |title=Black Sabbath: 3-in-1 Horror Bill Is Bowl of Gruel |journal=[[The Boston Globe]]|page=40}}</ref>

Reviewing the English-language version of the film, ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' praised the film stating that "pictorially it's amazing, and even the script and dubbing are way above average."<ref name="timeout-review">{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/black-sabbath|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|title=Black Sabbath|accessdate=March 29, 2014|author=DP}}</ref> ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' compared the film to anthology horror films made by the British production company [[Amicus]] noting that "If only Amicus...had taken heed they might have got some ideas as to what can be done with the format."<ref name="timeout-review" />
''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' awarded the film an A- rating referring to it as "excellent" and that the stories were "composed of three tales of expertly building suspense"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20716419,00.html|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|title=Black Sabbath|date=July 10, 2013|accessdate=March 29, 2014}}</ref>

In contemporary reviews of the Italian-language version, ''[[The Dissolve]]'' gave the film three and a half stars out of five, stating "There are small twists in all three stories, but for the most part, the segments suggest where they<U+2019>re headed early" and that the dialogue in the film is "sparse, and doesn't shy away from any exploitable elements, from scantily clad women to bloody wounds and warped-faced ghouls. But even more terrifying is the movie<U+2019>s atmosphere of doom [...] ''Black Sabbath'' is fraught with fatalism."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thedissolve.com/reviews/55-black-sabbath-kidnapped/|publisher=[[The Dissolve]]|title=Black Sabbath / Kidnapped|date=July 16, 2013|accessdate=March 29, 2014|author=Murray, Noel}}</ref> ''[[Total Film]]'' awarded the film four stars out of five, referring to it as a "wonderful horror anthology"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/blu-ray/black-sabbath|work=[[Total Film]]|accessdate=March 29, 2014|author=Glasby, Matt|date=May 7, 2013|title=Reviews}}</ref> Online film database [[AllMovie]] praised "The Wurdulak" stating that Karloff's "ghostly visage provides several unforgettable scares" and that "The Drop of Water" is short but "remains scary and suspenseful throughout"<ref name="allmovie-review" /> AllMovie described "The Telephone" as "only an average tale that follows through to a predictable twist"<ref name="allmovie-review" /> In the early 2010s, ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/best-horror-films|work=Time Out|accessdate=April 13, 2014|title=The 100 best horror films}}</ref> ''Black Sabbath'' placed at number 73 on their top list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/the-100-best-horror-films-the-list?pageNumber=3|work=Time Out|accessdate=April 13, 2014|title=The 100 best horror films: the list|author=NF}}</ref>
