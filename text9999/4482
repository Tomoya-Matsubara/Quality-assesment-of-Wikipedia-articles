'''Ohio State Route 55''' '''(OH 55)''' is an east-west [[state route]] in western [[Ohio]].  Its western terminus is near the town of [[Laura, Ohio|Laura]] at [[Ohio State Route 571|OH 571]], and its eastern terminus is in downtown [[Urbana, Ohio|Urbana]] at the confluence of [[U.S. Route 36 (Ohio)|US 36]], [[U.S. Route 68 (Ohio)|US 68]], [[Ohio State Route 29|OH 29]] and [[Ohio State Route 54|OH 54]].  OH 55 runs concurrent with US 68 for 1 mile approaching its eastern terminus.

== Route description ==
OH 55 starts from an intersection with [[Ohio State Route 571|OH 571]] just east of [[Laura, Ohio|Laura]] in [[Union Township, Miami County, Ohio|Union Township]].   OH 55 starts out in a northeasterly direction by straddling the Ludlow Creek and some woods on the south side, and farmland on the north side, with occasional houses along the way.  OH 55 intersects Miami County Road 50, then turns easterly, meeting County Road 9 further east.  Bending slightly to the southeast, OH 55 meets Elleman Road, then turns east until it intersects Davis Road, where it shifts to the northeast, and heads into [[Ludlow Falls, Ohio|Ludlow Falls]].   OH 55 maneuvers through this predominantly residential village via Greenville Avenue, Covington Avenue and Friend Street, along which OH 55 meets [[Ohio State Route 48|OH 48]] at a T-intersection.   Here, OH 55 turns south and departs Ludlow Falls concurrent with OH 48.<ref name="yahoo1">{{cite map|url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&lat=40.010333&lon=-84.292705&zoom=13&q1=39.99263%2C-84.394242&q2=40.039581%2C-84.203312&w0=40.03155773494504%2C-84.20127868652344|title=Western overview map of OH 55|publisher=Yahoo Maps|cartography=NAVTEQ|accessdate=2009-01-18}}</ref>

OH 55 and OH 48 run together for less than 0.5 mile, crossing Ludlow Creek in the process.  OH 55 splits off from OH 48, and resumes an easterly trek through farm country.  OH 55 starts to bend northeasterly as it meets Calumet Road, crosses over the [[Stillwater River (Ohio)|Stillwater River]], and intersects Kessler-Frederick Road consecutively.   Continuing northeasterly, OH 55 has intersections with Greenlee Road and Miami County Road 139.  OH 55 departs Union Township, and enters [[Concord Township, Miami County, Ohio|Concord Township]], whereupon it meets Horseshoe Bend Road (Miami County Road 39).  OH 55 passes an intersection with Miami County Road 132, and then meets Miami County Road 41.  At that intersection, OH 55 enters into [[Troy, Ohio|Troy]], and the landscape changes from rural to suburban, with subdivisions dotting the landscape.<ref name="yahoo1">{{cite map|url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&lat=40.010333&lon=-84.292705&zoom=13&q1=39.99263%2C-84.394242&q2=40.039581%2C-84.203312&w0=40.03155773494504%2C-84.20127868652344|title=Western overview map of OH 55|publisher=Yahoo Maps|cartography=NAVTEQ|accessdate=2009-01-18}}</ref>

[[Image:OH55WB in Troy.jpg|right|thumb|View looking west along WB OH 55 in downtown Troy. An aged BL I-75 shield accompanies the OH 55 shield shown here.]]OH 55 widens out to a four-lane divided highway at the Bamhart Road intersection, where the highway enters into a more commercial area.  Following Fenner Road, OH 55 arrives a diamond interchange with [[Interstate 75 (Ohio)|I-75]] .  East of I-75, OH 55 almost immediately arrives at the eastern terminus of  [[Ohio State Route 718|OH 718]], a signalized T-intersection.  Past OH 718, OH 55 narrows down to two lanes, and enters into a primarily residential portion of Troy along West Market Street.  OH 55 meets South Market Street, the former routing of [[U.S. Route 25|US 25]], and turns northeasterly toward the central business district.  Once into downtown Troy, OH 55 intersects [[Ohio State Route 41|OH 41]] at a traffic circle in Public Square.<ref name="yahoo1">{{cite map|url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&lat=40.010333&lon=-84.292705&zoom=13&q1=39.99263%2C-84.394242&q2=40.039581%2C-84.203312&w0=40.03155773494504%2C-84.20127868652344|title=Western overview map of OH 55|publisher=Yahoo Maps|cartography=NAVTEQ|accessdate=2009-01-18}}</ref>

Departing from the traffic circle in a northeasterly fashion, OH 55 intersects Water Street, then immediately crosses the [[Great Miami River]].   After crossing the river, OH 55 turns easterly onto Staunton Road from Market Street.  While passing to the north of the Miami Shores Golf Course, a series of residential subdivisions abut the north side of OH 55.  On the outskirts of Troy, OH 55 meets [[Ohio State Route 202|OH 202]] at its northern terminus.  Entering into [[Staunton Township, Miami County, Ohio|Staunton Township]], OH 55 starts to trend northeasterly, with the residential setting yielding to a more rural landscape featuring vast amounts of farmland, with the occasional house situated off of the highway.  OH 55 intersects Sayers Road, then crosses into [[Lost Creek Township, Miami County, Ohio|Lost Creek Township]].  After passing Casstown-Sidney Road, OH 55 arrives in [[Casstown, Ohio|Casstown]].  Entering into town on Troy Pike, OH 55 turns north onto Main Street, and follows Casstown<U+2019>s main drag up to the [[Ohio State Route 589|OH 589]] junction.   OH 55 turns easterly onto Addison Street, while OH 589 northbound begins straight ahead at that intersection.<ref name="yahoo2">{{cite map|url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&lat=40.07944&lon=-83.972867&zoom=12&q1=40.039565%2C-84.20328&q2=40.059391%2C-83.994432&q3=40.093362%2C-83.75445&q4=40.10797%2C-83.752433|title=Eastern overview map of OH 55|publisher=Yahoo Maps|cartography=NAVTEQ|accessdate=2009-01-18}}</ref>

OH 55 departs Casstown, and continues easterly through Lost Creek Township.   Turning northeasterly again, OH 55 passes occasional patches of trees amidst the vast farmland.   OH 55 intersects Rugged Hill Road, bends back to the east, then meets Sodom Road.  Trending more southeasterly at this point, OH 55 arrives at a T-intersection that marks the northern terminus of [[Ohio State Route 201|OH 201]].   East of there, OH 55 resumes an easterly path, intersecting Alcony-Conover Road, and crossing into [[Champaign County, Ohio|Champaign County]].<ref name="yahoo2">{{cite map|url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&lat=40.07944&lon=-83.972867&zoom=12&q1=40.039565%2C-84.20328&q2=40.059391%2C-83.994432&q3=40.093362%2C-83.75445&q4=40.10797%2C-83.752433|title=Eastern overview map of OH 55|publisher=Yahoo Maps|cartography=NAVTEQ|accessdate=2009-01-18}}</ref>

Into Champaign County, OH 55 makes a brief trip through [[Jackson Township, Champaign County, Ohio|Jackson Township]] en route to [[Christiansburg, Ohio|Christiansburg]].  OH 55 passes through the community along Pike Street, a primarily residential street.   Departing Christiansburg to the east, OH 55 re-emerges into rural Jackson Township.   Turning northeasterly,  OH 55 passes by Panhandle Road, then curves to the east just prior to meeting [[Ohio State Route 235|OH 235]].  Vast swaths of farmland and the occasional house compose OH 55<U+2019>s surroundings east of OH 235, as the highway passes by intersections with St. Paris-New Carlisle Road, Heck Road and Dialton Road.  OH 55 next enters into [[Mad River Township, Champaign County, Ohio|Mad River Township]].   OH 55 passes through the hamlet of [[Thackery, Ohio|Thackery]], briefly turning north at the Hampton-Donnellsville Road intersection there before resuming its easterly course.   The highway turns southeasterly where it meets Vance Road, then makes a turn to the northeast in the unincorporated community of [[Terre Haute, Ohio|Terre Haute]] at the intersection of Coffin Station Road and Storms Creek Road.   The northeasterly trend of this two-lane route continues until Rhodes Road, where OH 55 takes on a more east-northeasterly trend through the intersection with Valley Pike, which also serves as the southern terminus of [[Ohio State Route 560|OH 560]].<ref name="yahoo2">{{cite map|url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&lat=40.07944&lon=-83.972867&zoom=12&q1=40.039565%2C-84.20328&q2=40.059391%2C-83.994432&q3=40.093362%2C-83.75445&q4=40.10797%2C-83.752433|title=Eastern overview map of OH 55|publisher=Yahoo Maps|cartography=NAVTEQ|accessdate=2009-01-18}}</ref>

Proceeding eastward, OH 55 meets Bair Road, then turns northeasterly upon crossing over the [[Mad River (Ohio)|Mad River]].    OH 55 then parallels the Mad River for a stretch, intersecting Hickory Grove Road in the process.  Curving ever so slightly to the east, OH 55 meets Old Troy Pike.  Turning due east, OH 55 enters into [[Urbana, Ohio|Urbana]].  The rural setting fades, and OH 55 enters into a more commercialized area along, fittingly, Commercial Street.  OH 55 meets [[U.S. Route 68 (Ohio)|US 68]] at a T-intersection in the southern portion of Urbana.  There, OH 55 turns northerly, and the two routes combine to form the main north-south drag through the city.  In downtown Urbana, OH 55 comes to an end as the US 68/OH 55 duplex intersects [[U.S. Route 36 (Ohio)|US 36]], [[Ohio State Route 29|OH 29]] and [[Ohio State Route 54|OH 54]] at a traffic circle.<ref name="yahoo2">{{cite map|url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&lat=40.07944&lon=-83.972867&zoom=12&q1=40.039565%2C-84.20328&q2=40.059391%2C-83.994432&q3=40.093362%2C-83.75445&q4=40.10797%2C-83.752433|title=Eastern overview map of OH 55|publisher=Yahoo Maps|cartography=NAVTEQ|accessdate=2009-01-18}}</ref>

==History==
The OH 55 that exists today is only a shadow of what it was when first designated in the 1920s.  OH 55 came into being in 1923.<ref name="1922map">{{cite map|title=Ohio State Map|year=1922|publisher=[[Ohio Department of Transportation]]|cartography=Ohio Department of Transportation}}</ref> <ref name="1923map">{{cite map|title=Ohio State Map|year=1923|publisher=Ohio Department of Transportation|cartography=Ohio Department of Transportation}}</ref>   Its original routing took it from [[Troy, Ohio|Troy]] all the way up to [[Parma, Ohio|Parma]].  This route encompassed the current alignment of OH 55 between Troy and [[Urbana, Ohio|Urbana]], the current [[U.S. Route 36 (Ohio)|US 36]] from Urbana to [[Delaware, Ohio|Delaware]], the current [[U.S. Route 42 (Ohio)|US 42]] from Delaware to [[Medina, Ohio|Medina]], the current [[Ohio State Route 3|OH 3]] from Medina to [[Hinckley, Ohio|Hinckley]], and the current [[Ohio State Route 94|OH 94]] from Hinckley to Parma. <ref name="2007map">{{cite map|title=Ohio State Map|year=2007|publisher=Ohio Department of Transportation|cartography=Ohio Department of Transportation}}</ref> 

In 1926, OH 55 was extended on the western end along a previously un-numbered road to [[Ludlow Falls, Ohio|Ludlow Falls]]. In that same year, however, the advent of the U.S. Highway System resulted in a major truncation of OH 55 on the east side.  Its new eastern terminus became [[Ohio State Route 4|OH 4]] southwest of [[Milford Center, Ohio|Milford Center]]. <ref name="1925map">{{cite map|title=Ohio State Map|year=1925|publisher=Ohio Department of Transportation|cartography=Ohio Department of Transportation}}</ref> <ref name="1926map">{{cite map|title=Ohio State Map|year=1926|publisher=Ohio Department of Transportation|cartography=Ohio Department of Transportation}}</ref> <ref name="1927map">{{cite map|title=Ohio State Map|year=1927|publisher=Ohio Department of Transportation|cartography=Ohio Department of Transportation}}</ref>  OH 55 was further truncated on the east end in 1932, when the coming of US 36 resulted in the relocation of OH 55's eastern terminus to its current location in downtown Urbana.<ref name="1931map">{{cite map|title=Ohio State Map|year=1931|publisher=Ohio Department of Transportation|cartography=Ohio Department of Transportation}}</ref> <ref name="1932map">{{cite map|title=Ohio State Map|year=1932|publisher=Ohio Department of Transportation|cartography=Ohio Department of Transportation}}</ref> 

1937 brought another elongation of OH 55 on the western end.  In that year, it was extended from Ludlow Falls to its present western terminus.<ref name="1936map">{{cite map|title=Ohio State Map|year=1936|publisher=Ohio Department of Transportation|cartography=Ohio Department of Transportation}}</ref> <ref name="1937map">{{cite map|title=Ohio State Map|year=1937|publisher=Ohio Department of Transportation|cartography=Ohio Department of Transportation}}</ref>
