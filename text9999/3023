'''Troy Smith''' (born [[July 20]], [[1984]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]) is an [[American football]] [[quarterback]] for the [[Baltimore Ravens]] of the [[National Football League]].  He was a former starting [[quarterback#Dual threat quarterbacks|dual-threat quarterback]] for The [[Ohio State Buckeyes football | Ohio State University football]] team from 2004-2006 and the winner of the 2006 [[Heisman Trophy]].

He graduated from [[Glenville High School]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] where he was coached by [[Ted Ginn, Sr.]], father of his Ohio State and high school teammate [[Ted Ginn, Jr.]] After a strong junior season at Glenville, Smith was invited to participate in the Elite 11 competition, which features the eleven top ranked high school quarterback prospects in the United States. Smith earned great praise following his performance, and although it was relatively late in the recruiting process, Ohio State offered Smith a football scholarship. He verbally committed to the [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Buckeyes]], signing his [[letter of intent]] on February 6, 2002 as the last player to do so for the Buckeyes.

==Early life==
Troy Smith's mother raised him and two siblings in [[Columbus, Ohio]], then moved to Cleveland in 1987, without the support of his father. Smith first expressed interest in playing football in Cleveland, where he played for the Glenville A's midget football team, initially as [[running back]] and [[tight end]]. Irvin White, his coach, moved Smith to quarterback after a few games and Smith stayed in the position. In 1993,<!-- the source isn't clear about this date --> Smith was placed in foster care with Diane and Irvin White while his mother dealt with personal issues. <ref>{{cite news

==High school career==
Smith played his first two years at [[St. Edward High School (Lakewood, Ohio)|St. Edward High School]] in Lakewood, Ohio, but was thrown off the team after elbowing an opponent in the head while playing in a varsity basketball game.<ref>Curtis, Bryan.

August 20, 2006</ref> He threw for 969 yards and 12 touchdowns as a senior, playing alongside Ted Ginn Jr. (Miami Dolphins) they led Glenville to the state playoffs. Smith also played three years of basketball and ran track (high jump, long jump and 1,600-meter relay). [[West Virginia University]] had recruited Smith as well as [[Ohio State]]. Smith accepted the last scholarship of Ohio State's 2002 football recruiting class.<ref>{{cite news

==College career==
[[Image:2006-09 Austin Texas 091.jpg|right|thumb|Ohio State's Troy Smith hands off to [[Antonio Pittman]] vs the [[2006 Texas Longhorn football team|2006 Texas Longhorns]]]]
As a [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirted]] [[freshman]] for the Buckeyes, Smith played sparingly at [[running back]] and [[kick returner]] in 2003. Smith played the season opener against [[University of Washington|Washington]] as a scatback and returner, and he compiled fourteen yards rushing and 83 return yards. After the game, he came on the NFL scouting radar as an "athlete". 
  
He entered his [[wiktionary:sophomore|sophomore]] season as the backup quarterback to [[Justin Zwick]], but took over as the starter when Zwick was injured halfway through the 2004 season against [[University of Iowa|Iowa]]. Smith won four of the five games he started in 2004, including a victory over the archrival [[University of Michigan|Michigan Wolverines]]. Smith was suspended for breaking an undisclosed team rule before the [[Alamo Bowl]], with Coach Tressel extending the suspension to include the first game of the 2005 season after it was revealed that Smith had accepted $500 from a booster.<ref name="difficultroad">{{cite news

With Smith at QB, Ohio State lost only two games in the 2005 regular season, one as a starter. The first was to the eventual [[2006 Rose Bowl|BCS National Champion]] [[2005 Texas Longhorn football team|Texas Longhorns]] (which he did not start) and the other was to the [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State Nittany Lions]], [[Big Ten Conference football champions|co-Big Ten champions]]. Smith's 2005 stats included 2,282 passing yards with 16 touchdowns and four interceptions. This led to a [[passer rating]] of 162.66, the fourth-highest of the season.<ref>{{cite web

In the second week of the 2006 season, Smith and the Buckeyes took revenge for their 2005 loss to Texas. The top ranked Buckeyes won their rematch with the (again) second-ranked Longhorns, 24-7. Smith went 17-27 with 269 yards passing, two touchdowns, and no interceptions. For many fans and analysts, Smith's performance against the Longhorns gave credibility to the preseason Heisman Trophy hype he'd received. His passing statistics improved during the 2006 season, completing 67% of his passes for 2,507 yards, with 30 touchdowns and five interceptions. This led to a quarterback rating of 167.87, again fourth in the country.<ref>{{cite web|

In three games against Michigan, Smith has a total of 1,151 yards of total offense, two rushing touchdowns, and seven passing touchdowns.  The Buckeyes won all three games, making Smith the first Ohio State quarterback since [[Tippy Dye]] (1934-1936) to quarterback in three victories over Michigan, and the first to win three straight games against Michigan as a starter.<ref>{{cite news

Smith's college football career came to an end on January 8, 2007, when he and the [[Ohio State Buckeyes]] were beaten by the [[Florida Gators]] in the [[2007 BCS National Championship Game]], 41-14. Smith completed just four of 14 passes for 35 yards along with an interception, a fumble, and was sacked 5 times.

===Heisman Trophy===
Smith won the 2006 Heisman Memorial Trophy on December 9, 2006.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2692486 | title=Rise of Troy: Buckeyes QB wins Heisman Trophy | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | date=[[2006-12-12]] | accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref> He beat out sophomore RB [[Darren McFadden]] (2nd) from Arkansas and QB [[Brady Quinn]] (3rd), senior quarterback from Notre Dame. Smith became the first true quarterback from the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] to ever win the award.

In winning the 2006 Heisman Trophy, Smith took 86.7% of the first place votes, which is a record. His tally of 2,540 votes was the third largest behind that of the 2005 Heisman Trophy winner, [[Reggie Bush]] of the [[University of Southern California]] (2,541 votes) and 1968 winner [[O.J. Simpson]] also of USC (2,853 votes). His margin of victory (1,662 votes) was also the second largest in the history of the award, eclipsed only by O.J. Simpson who won by 1,750 votes. Troy Smith joined Les Horvath (1944), Vic Janowicz (1950), Howard "Hopalong" Cassady (1955), Archie Griffin (1974 and 1975) and Eddie George (1995) in the elite Buckeye fraternity.

==Pro career==
===Rookie season===
Smith declared for the [[2007 NFL Draft]]. Despite winning the Heisman Trophy, Smith saw his draft stock drop considerably after the 41-14 loss to Florida in the 2007 BCS National Championship Game. At 6'0", his height (considered smaller than ideal) was cited as a liability. The fact that he skipped the [[NFL Combine]] did not help.<ref>[http://www.dispatch.com/dispatch/content/sports/stories/2007/04/28/draft_osu28.ART_ART_04-28-07_D1_7P6HA6B.html Smith will likely play waiting game]</ref> Smith was quoted by the media urging his hometown team, the [[Cleveland Browns]], to select him in the NFL Draft. Fans also set up a website ([http://www.drafttroy.com/ DraftTroy.com]) urging the Browns to take Smith. However, the Browns drafted [[Brady Quinn]] 22nd overall in the [[2007 NFL Draft]] reducing the chances of Smith going to Cleveland.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/ NFL.com]<!-- specific page? --></ref><ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/cp/football/070130/f01309A.html Ohio State quarterback Troy Smith pushing Browns hard to draft him]</ref> 

On Day 2, Smith was finally drafted at the end of the fifth round by the Baltimore Ravens. He proceeded to sign a three-year contract with the Ravens on July 24, 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/default.asp?page=/nfl/news/ABN4092903.htm | title=Ravens sign Troy Smith, two others | publisher=The Sports Network | date=[[2007-07-24]] | accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref> On August 27, 2007 Drew Olson was released by the Baltimore Ravens elevating Troy Smith to the third string quarterback position. Smith was named second-string quarterback for the Ravens on November 13, 2007, backing up new starter [[Kyle Boller]] after a shoulder injury to starter [[Steve McNair]]. Ravens head coach Brian Billick maintained that Smith could be used in the future. "That's going to be a fun challenge for Troy, because now he's been around enough," Billick said. "The focus and attention that he brings to [preparing] is heightened."<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/football/nfl/11/13/ravens.mcnair.ap/index.html Ravens switch quarterbacks]</ref>

Smith got his first regular season playing time in the fourth quarter of the home game against the Indianapolis [[Indianapolis Colts|Colts]] on December 9, 2007, completing three of five pass attempts and scrambling 6 yards for his first NFL touchdown in the 44-20 loss.  After his relative success against the Colts, many Baltimore Ravens fans were calling for Smith to replace [[Kyle Boller]] as the Ravens' starting quarterback. On December 16, 2007 Troy Smith came in for an injured Kyle Boller in the game against the Miami Dolphins. Smith led the Ravens down the field for a field goal which forced overtime. The Ravens lost 22-16 in overtime, after a missed 44 yard field goal. On December 20, 2007, Kyle Boller officially was considered the backup due to injury for the Week 16 game, giving Troy Smith his first professional start against the Seattle Seahawks. In Week 17 the Ravens played the Steelers, who pulled some of their starters, and Troy Smith started again. He went 16-of-27 for 171 yards and one touchdown, with no interceptions and no fumbles lost, and led the Ravens to their first win since October 14.  

Smith finished his rookie season by totaling 452 yards and two touchdowns passing and 54 yards and a touchdown rushing in four games on his debut season, for 506 total yards.
