===Possible Questions of Biles Appointment to the Supreme Court===

The appointment of Daniel Biles has been met with a firestorm of criticism from many judicial conservatives over his lack of judicial experience and also from also many ethics watchdog groups over his campaign contributions to Governor [[Kathleen Sebelius]] and the Kansas Democratic Party.

Transparency records from KanView show that during the 2008 Fiscal year that Biles was the recipient of over $360,000 of contacts for legal representation for the Kansas Department of Education, Kansas State Lottery, and the Kansas Department of Transportation<ref name="Contracts">[http://kansasmeadowlark.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/ks-expenditures-to-gates-biles.jpg "Kansas Meadowlark" Bile's Contract Expidentures, January 7, 2009]</ref>.  The amount that Biles has received from Kansas state contracts along with Biles and his wife and other partners in his law firm giving very generous donations to Governor Kathleen Sebelius and also other prominent candidates, including [[Barack Obama]] for President, raise the question if Biles received the appointment on the basis of being a financially generous donor to Kathleen Sebelius.

It is has been noted by the ''Kansas City Star'' that Governor Sebelius and her husband have been friends of Biles for more than three decades, starting when the Governor's husband was an attorney for the Topeka School District and Biles was an Associated Press reporter. Sebelius has said that she has relied on Biles for legal advice since becoming governor.  What was noted that Biles during the 2002 Governor's Campaign gave over $1,000 to Sebelius and his wife gave over $1200 from 2002 to 2006 raising the question if patronage in financial terms to Governor Sebelius played a role in his appointment over sound judicial experience<ref name="Pay for Play">[http://kansasmeadowlark.com/2009/01/08/sebelius-picks-obama-donor-for-kansas-supreme-court/ "Kansas Meadowlark" ''Kathleen Sebelius'' picks donor for ''Kansas Supreme Court'', January 7, 2009]</ref>.

==Associations and Memberships==

Biles is a member of the National Council of State Education Attorneys, the Kansas Bar Association; the Kansas Association for Justice, and the [[Johnson County, Kansas|Johnson County]] Bar Association.
