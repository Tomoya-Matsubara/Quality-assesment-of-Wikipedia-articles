The cover art for their first album, ''[[Part I: John Shade, Your Fortune's Made]]'', release in 2009, features silhouettes, and music videos replace band members with actors and animation, such as the video of the song "No Wedding Cake" where band members appear as animals.

In 2010, the band released ''Part II: The New December'', described by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' as "screwball pastiche pop ''[that]'' sounds like an [[algebra]] problem but feels like a come-on."<ref>{{cite web| author =Brown, August| date = July 7, 2010 | title=Live Review: Fol Chen and Baths at the Echo|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/07/live-review-fol-chen-and-baths-at-the-echo.html|publisher= ''Pop & Hiss'' (blog of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'')|accessdate= February 10, 2013}}</ref> Sinosa Loa joined the group at this time as keyboardist and vocalist, although the band favored group vocals and shared lead duties among most members. They toured throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe with other American bands, including [[dance-punk]] [[Liars (band)|Liars]], [[dance-punk]] [[!!!]], and [[indie rock|indie-rock]] [[The Apples in Stereo]]. 

During a month-long residency at [[The Echo (venue)|The Echo]] nightclub in Los Angeles, the band featured different shows each night{{spaced ndash}} one show invited guest singers found via [[Craigslist]] to perform with the band as a sort of live [[karaoke]];<ref>{{cite web|author=Youssef, Andrew| date = August 17, 2010 | title=Fol Chen, Crocodiles, Light Pollution, Robotanists @ Echo, Los Angeles 08/16/10|url=http://stereogum.com/473882/fol-chen-crocodiles-light-pollution-robotanists-echo-los-angeles-081610/concert/|publisher = ''[[Stereogum]]'' (blog) |accessdate= February 10, 2013}}</ref> another night saw [[metal band]] [[Viscera (band)|Viscera]] playing exclusively Fol Chen covers.<ref>{{cite web| author = Staff | date = undated | title=One Night Only: Viscera Covers Fol Chen|url=http://terrorbird.com/blog/one-night-only-viscera-covers-fol-chen|publisher=Terrorbird Media | accessdate = February 10, 2013}}</ref>

In November 2010, Samuel Bing and Loa traveled to [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], to perform two long-form, [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]]-inspired reworkings of the two studio albums, followed by a workshop and recording session where they invited local musicians (and curious non-musicians) to join them in building a new Fol Chen song.<ref>{{cite web| author=Chernov, Sergey| date = November 19, 2010 | title=Chernov's Choice|url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=100&story_id=32981| work = [[The St. Petersburg Times]] | accessdate= February 10, 2013}}</ref> 

On July 28, 2011, the pair also held a workshop produced with the arts organization [[Machine Project]] at the [[Walker Art Center]], a [[contemporary art|contemporary-art]] center in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], to introduce the Fol Chen Verbal Algorithm Composer-Free Song Generator. The project allowed museum visitors to to record their experience with a piece of art and have it converted into a song that they could take home.<ref>{{cite web| author = Staff | date = undate | title= The Fol Chen Verbal Algorithm Composer-Free Song Generator|url=http://www.walkerart.org/calendar/2011/the-fol-chen-verbal-algorithm-composer-free-s-2|publisher= [[Walker Art Center]] |accessdate= February 10, 2013}}</ref>

The band collaborated with [[Monome]], a computer-manufacturing company, in late 2011 to make the Tetrafol, a motion-sensitive pyramidal sound device.{{clarify|date-February 2013|reason=what is pyramidal sound?|date=February 2013}} The Tetrafol came pre-loaded with Fol Chen samples but allowed users to apply their own sounds.
