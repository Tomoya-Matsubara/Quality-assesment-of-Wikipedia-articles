'''Andrew William''' "'''Nicky'''" '''Barr''', [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] and [[Medal bar|Bar]] (10&nbsp;December 1915 <U+2013> 12&nbsp;June 2006) was a member of the [[Australian national rugby union team]] who became a [[flying ace]] in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) during World War&nbsp;II. He was credited with twelve aerial victories, all scored flying the [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss P-40]] fighter.  Born in New Zealand, Barr was raised in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and first represented the state in rugby in 1936. Selected to play for Australia against the United Kingdom in 1939, he had just arrived in England when the tour was cancelled following the outbreak of war. He joined the RAAF in 1940 and was posted to [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] with [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;3 Squadron]] in September 1941. His first three victories were attained in the P-40D Tomahawk and the remainder in the P-40E Kittyhawk.

Barr's achievements as a combat pilot earned him the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] and [[Medal bar|Bar]]. Shortly after taking command of No.&nbsp;3 Squadron in May 1942, he was shot down and captured by [[Axis powers|Axis forces]], and incarcerated in Italy. He escaped and assisted other [[Allies|Allied]] fugitives to safety, receiving the [[Military Cross]] for his efforts. Repatriated to England, he saw action during the [[Operation Overlord|invasion of Normandy]] in June 1944 before returning to Australia as chief instructor with [[No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF|No.&nbsp;2 Operational Training Unit]]. After the war he became a company director, and rejoined the RAAF as an active reserve officer from 1951 to 1953. From the early 1960s he was heavily involved in the [[oilseed]] industry, for which he was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1983. He died in 2006, aged ninety.

==Early career==
Andrew Barr was born in [[Wellington, New Zealand|Wellington]], New Zealand, on 10&nbsp;December 1915; he had a twin brother, Jack. The family moved to Australia when the boys were six. Growing up in [[Melbourne]], Andrew attended [[Kew, Victoria|Kew Public School]] and played [[Australian rules football]]. He was also the Victorian Schoolboys' 100 yards athletics champion three years in succession, from 1926 to 1928. In 1931, aged fifteen, he began his association with the [[Lord Somers Camp]] and Power House social and sporting organisations located at [[Western Port]]. After leaving school, Barr studied construction at [[Swinburne University of Technology|Swinburne Technical College]], but later took a diploma course in accountancy and made it his profession. He started playing [[rugby union]] in 1935 through one of his friends in the Power House club. Weighing {{Convert|80|kg|lbs}} and just under {{Convert|6|ft|cm}} tall, Barr gained selection for Victoria as a [[hooker (rugby union)|hooker]] the following year. In 1939, he was chosen to play in the United Kingdom with the Australian national team, the [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]]. The tour was cancelled however less than a day after the team arrived in the UK on 2&nbsp;September, due to the outbreak of World War&nbsp;II.<ref name="AWM 023231">[http://cas.awm.gov.au/item/023231 Item 023231] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

Returning to Australia on the [[RMS Strathaird|RMS ''Strathaird'']], Barr joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] as an air cadet on 4&nbsp;March 1940.<ref name="AWM">[http://www.awm.gov.au/units/people_1077820.asp Wing Commander Andrew William Barr, MC, DFC & bar] at Australian War Memorial.

The squadron then re-equipped with P-40E Kittyhawks; Barr was flying the new model when he became an [[Flying ace|ace]] on New Year's Day 1942, shooting down two [[Junkers Ju 87|Junkers Ju&nbsp;87 ''Stukas'']].<ref name="Garrisson"/><ref name="Thomas">Thomas 2005, pp. 22<U+2013>23</ref> On 8&nbsp;March, he led a [[Flight (military unit)|flight]] of six Kittyhawks to intercept a raid on [[Tobruk]] by twelve Ju&nbsp;87s escorted by ten [[Macchi C.&nbsp;202]]s and two Bf&nbsp;109s.

Three times while serving with No.&nbsp;3 Squadron, Barr was himself shot down. The first occasion was on 11&nbsp;January 1942 when, having destroyed a Bf&nbsp;109 and a [[Fiat G.50]], he was preparing to touch down in the desert to pick up a fellow pilot who had crash landed. He had his undercarriage halfway down when he was "jumped" by two other Bf&nbsp;109s. He immediately engaged both and shot one down before more German fighters arrived and he was hit and forced to land behind enemy lines.<ref name="Garrisson"/><ref name="Wilson">Wilson 2005, pp. 86<U+2013>87</ref> As one of the German planes came in low to strafe the downed Kittyhawk, Barr ran straight at it in an attempt to throw the pilot off his aim, and was injured by ricocheting fragments of rock struck by cannon shells. A tribe of friendly [[Senussi]] Arabs found him, dressed his wounds, and helped him return to Allied lines.<ref>Dornan 2005, pp. 67<U+2013>73</ref> For this exploit, and his earlier successes, Barr was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC), the full citation being published in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 20&nbsp;February 1942:<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=35463|startpage=844|date=20 February 1942|accessdate=on 20 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00309/003090320.pdf|format=PDF|title=Recommendation for Andrew William Barr to be awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=on 30 April 2010}}</ref>

{{quote|This officer, who commenced operational flying in November, 1941, has displayed the greatest keenness and skill as a fighter pilot. In December, 1941, during a patrol over the Derna area, he shot down a Messerschmitt 110; the next day, in the same area, he destroyed a Messerschmitt 110 and a Junkers 88. One day in January, 1942, his squadron formed part of an escort to bomber aircraft operating over El Agheila. Enemy aircraft were encountered and, in the ensuing engagement, Flying Officer Barr attacked 2 Italian fighters, one of which he shot down. He then observed one of his fellow pilots, who had been shot down, waving to him from the ground but, when preparing to make a landing in an attempt to rescue him, Flying Officer Barr was attacked by 2 Messerschmitt 109s. Although the undercarriage of his aircraft was not fully retracted, he immediately manoeuvred to engage the attackers, only to find that his guns had jammed. Quickly rectifying the fault he delivered an accurate burst of fire which caused one of the Messerschmitts to disintegrate in the air. A further 2 enemy aircraft joined in the combat and Flying Officer Barr was wounded and forced down. While on the ground he was further wounded by the enemy's fire but, despite this, he made his way through the enemy's lines and rejoined our own forces some 3 days later. He brought back much valuable information regarding the disposition of enemy tanks and defences. Flying Officer Barr displayed the greatest courage and tenacity throughout. He has destroyed 8 enemy aircraft.}}

On 25&nbsp;May 1942, Barr had to land in the desert when his engine overheated.
