'''Talimogene laherparepvec''' (''tal im' oh jeen la her" pa rep' vek''), often simply called "T-VEC" is a cancer-killing (oncolytic) virus currently being studied for the treatment of [[melanoma]] and other advanced cancers. The drug was initially developed by BioVex, Inc. under the name OncoVEX<sup>GM-CSF</sup> until it was acquired by [[Amgen]] in 2011.<ref>Bloomberg News. (2011, January 24).

==Mechanism of action==
T-VEC was engineered from herpes simplex 1 ([[HSV-1]]), a relatively innocuous [[virus]] that normally causes cold sores. A number of genetic modifications were made to the virus in order to:
* Attenuate the virus (so it can no longer cause herpes)
* Increase selectivity for cancer cells (so it destroys cancer cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed)
* Secrete the cytokine [[GM-CSF]] (a protein naturally secreted in the body to initiate an immune response)

T-VEC has a dual mechanism of action, destroying cancer both by directly attacking cancer cells and also by helping the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells. T-VEC is injected directly into a number of a patient<U+2019>s tumors. The virus invades both cancerous and healthy cells, but it is unable to replicate in healthy cells and thus they remain unharmed. Inside a cancer cell, the virus is able to replicate, secreting [[GM-CSF]] in the process. Eventually overwhelmed, the cancer cell lyses (ruptures), destroying the cell and releasing new viruses, GM-CSF, and an array of tumor-specific [[antigens]] (pieces of the cancer cell that are small enough to be recognized by the immune system).<ref>Liu BL, Robinson M, Han Z-Q, et al. ICP34.5 deleted herpes simplex virus with enhanced oncolytic, immune stimulating, and anti-tumour properties. ''Gene Therapy''. 2003;10:292<U+2013>303 . Available [http://www.phys.mcw.edu/documents/PDF/Research%20Papers/Liu.pdf here]</ref>

The GM-CSF attracts [[dendritic cells]] to the site. Dendritic cells are immune cells that process and present antigens to the immune system so that the immune system can then identify and destroy whatever produced the antigen. The dendritic cells pick up the tumor antigens, process them, and then present them on their surface to [[Cytotoxic T cell|cytotoxic (killer) T cells]]. Now the T cells are essentially "programmed" to recognize the cancer as a threat. These T cells lead an [[immune response]] that seeks and destroys cancer cells throughout the body (eg, tumors and cancer cells that were not directly injected with T-VEC).<ref>Liu BL, Robinson M, Han Z-Q, et al.

In this way, T-VEC has both a direct effect on injected tumors and a systemic effect throughout the entire body.<ref>N<U+00FA><U+00F1>ez MA. Tumor killer viruses. ''Mapping Ignorance''. January 9, 2013. Available [http://mappingignorance.org/2013/01/09/tumor-killer-viruses here]</ref> Because the [[adaptive immune system]] <U+201C>remembers<U+201D> a target once it has been identified, there is high likelihood that the effect of an oncolytic virus like T-VEC will be durable (eg, prevent relapse). And it is for this reason that T-VEC does not need to be injected into every tumor, just a few in order to start the immune process.

==Efficacy in melanoma==

Clinical efficacy in unresectable melanoma has been demonstrated in Phase II and Phase III [[clinical trials]].

The Phase II clinical trial was published in the ''Journal of Clinical Oncology'' in 2009. 50 patients with advanced melanoma (most of whom had failed previous treatment) were treated with T-VEC. The overall response rate (patients with a complete or partial response per [[RECIST]] criteria) was 26% (16% complete responses, 10% partial responses). Another 4% of patients had a surgical complete response, and another 20% had stable disease for at least 3 months. On an extension protocol, 3 more patients achieved complete responses, and overall survival was 54% at 1 year and 52% at 2 years<U+2014>demonstrating that responses to T-VEC are quite durable.<ref>Senzer NN, Kaufman HL, Amatruda T, et al. Phase II clinical trial of a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor<U+2013>encoding, second-generation oncolytic herpesvirus in patents with unresectable metastatic melanoma. ''J Clin Oncol''. 2009;27:5763-5771. Available [http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/27/34/5763.long here]</ref>

Consistent with other immunotherapies, some patients exhibited initial disease progression before responding to therapy because of the time it takes to generate the full immune response. Responses were seen in both injected and uninjected tumors (including those in visceral organs), demonstrating the systemic immunotherapeutic effect of T-VEC. Treatment was extremely well tolerated, with only [[Common Toxicity Criteria|Grade]] 1 or 2 drug-related side effects, the most common being mild flu-like symptoms.<ref>Senzer NN, Kaufman HL, Amatruda T, et al.

Amgen announced the initial results of the Phase III OPTiM trial on Mar. 19, 2013. This global, randomized, open-label trial compared T-VEC with subcutaneously administered GM-CSF (2:1 randomization) in 430 patients with unresectable [[Melanoma#Staging|stage IIIB, IIIC or IV melanoma]]. The primary endpoint was durable response rate (DRR), defined as a complete or partial tumor response lasting at least 6 months and starting within 12 months of treatment.<ref>Amgen press release. Amgen announces top-line results of phase 3 talimogene laherparepvec trial in melanoma. Mar 19, 2013. Available [http://www.amgen.com/media/media_pr_detail.jsp?releaseID=1798143 here]</ref>

T-VEC was proven to offer superior benefits in metastatic melanoma. DRR was achieved in 16% of patients receiving T-VEC compared with only 2% in the GM-CSF control group (''P''<.0001). The greatest benefit was seen in patient with stage IIIB or IIIC melanoma, with a 33% DRR vs 0% with GM-CSF. The objective response rate (any response) with T-VEC was 26%, with an impressive 11% of patients experiencing a complete response (complete disappearance of melanoma throughout the body). This demonstrated once again that T-VEC has a systemic immune effect that destroys distant, uninjected tumors.<ref>Andtbacka RHI, Collichio FA, Amatruda T et al.

''J Clin Oncol'' 31, 2013 (suppl; abstr LBA9008). Available [http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/117592-132 here]</ref> According to Financial Times one of the investigators involved questioned the ethics of the trial design, as the control arm received subcutaneous GM-CSF instead of standard care <ref>http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/24b5634e-f2e4-11e1-8577-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2idyuAroh</ref>

A trend toward improved survival with T-VEC was observed in a pre-specified interim analysis of this endpoint, with the final survival data (event-driven) expected in late 2013. At the interim analysis, T-VEC was associated with a 21% reduced risk of death. The most common side effects with T-VEC were fatigue, chills, and fever. No serious side effect occurred in more than 3% of patients in either arm of the study.<ref>Andtbacka RHI, Collichio FA, Amatruda T et al.

==Efficacy in head and neck cancer==

Clinical efficacy in squamous cell cancer of the head and neck ([[SCCHN]]) has been demonstrated in a Phase II trial, and a Phase III trial was started but terminated without explanation.<ref>ClinicalTrials.gov. Study of safety and efficacy of OncoVEX<sup>GM-CSF</sup> With cisplatin for treatment of locally advanced head and neck cancer. NLM Identifier: NCT01161498. Available [http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01161498 here].</ref>

The Phase II trial results were announced at ASCO in 2009 and published in ''Clinical Cancer Research'' in 2010. 17 patients with stage III or IVA SCCHN received one of 4 different doses of T-VEC along with concomitant cisplatin and radiotherapy. 93% of patients had a pathological complete response confirmed by neck resection. 82% of patients had a complete or partial radiologic response per [[RECIST]] criteria. The remaining patients had stable disease, with no patient (0%) experiencing disease progression. At the median post-treatment follow-up of 29 months, all (100%) patients continued to show loco-regional control with disease-specific survival at 82%. T-VEC was well tolerated and had a similar safety profile to that seen in the melanoma trials ([[Common Toxicity Criteria|Grade]] 1 or 2 side effects only, the most common being mild flu-like symptoms). 77% of patients remained relapse-free as of 2010.<ref>Harrington K, Hingorani M, Tanay M, et al.

==Tolerability==

T-VEC has generally been very well tolerated, with the vast majority of adverse events being mild or moderate ([[Common Toxicity Criteria|Grade]] 1 or 2). The most common side effects are mild fatigue, chills, or fever. In the Phase III OPTiM trial, the most common serious side effect was cellulitis, reported in only 2.1% of patients.<ref>Senzer NN, Kaufman HL, Amatruda T, et al.
