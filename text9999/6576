'''Michael Gordon "Mike" Oldfield''' (born  15 May 1953, [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Berkshire]]) is an [[England|English]] [[multi-instrumentalist]] [[musician]] and [[composer]], working a style that blends [[progressive rock]], [[folk music|folk]], ethnic or [[world music]], [[European classical music|classical music]], [[electronic music]], [[New Age music|New Age]] and more recently [[dance music|dance]]. His music is often elaborate and complex in nature. He is best known for his hit 1973 album ''[[Tubular Bells]]'', which broke new ground as an instrumental album and launched [[Virgin Records]], and for his 1983 hit single "[[Moonlight Shadow]]". He is also well known for his hit rendition of the [[Christmas]] piece, "[[In Dulci Jubilo (Mike Oldfield)|In Dulci Jubilo]]".

== History ==
Oldfield's parents are Maureen and Raymond Oldfield, a nurse and [[general practitioner]], respectively. His sister [[Sally Oldfield|Sally]] and brother [[Terry Oldfield|Terry]] are successful musicians in their own right and have appeared on several of his albums.  Mike Oldfield was born in the [[Battle Hospital]], [[Reading, Berkshire]] and he attended [[St Joseph's Convent School]], Highlands Junior School in [[Tilehurst]], St Edward's [[Preparatory School (UK)|Preparatory School]] <ref name=changeling>{{cite book |title=[[Changeling (Mike Oldfield)|Changeling]] |first=Mike |last=Oldfield  |year=2007 |isbn=978-1852273811 |publisher=[[Virgin Books]]}}</ref> and [[Presentation College, Reading|Presentation College]] in Reading. When Oldfield was 13 he moved with his parents to [[Harold Wood]] where he attended [[Hornchurch]] Grammar School. He only stayed there long enough to take one [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] examination in English as he had already begun his music career.<ref name=changeling/>

=== Early career ===
Oldfield's career began fairly early in his life, playing [[acoustic guitar]] in local [[folk club]]s. At this time, he already had two fifteen-minute instrumental pieces in which he would "go through all sorts of moods", a precursor to his landmark 1970s compositions. In his early teens, Oldfield was involved in a 'beat group' playing [[The Shadows]] style music (he has often cited [[Hank Marvin]] as a major influence, and would later cover The Shadows' song "[[Wonderful Land]]"). In 1967 he and his sister [[Sally Oldfield|Sally]] formed the folk duo [[The Sallyangie]] and were signed to [[Transatlantic Records]] after exposure in the local folk scene. An album, ''[[Children of the Sun (album)|Children of the Sun]]'' was issued in 1968. After Sallyangie disbanded, he formed another duo with his brother [[Terry Oldfield|Terry]], called [[Barefoot (band)|Barefoot]], which took him back to [[rock music]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/articles/97_07.shtml |title=Not Totally Tubular by Dave Thompson |publisher=Goldmine |date=1997-07-18 |accessdate=2008-04-02}}</ref>

In 1970 he joined ex-[[Soft Machine]] vocalist [[Kevin Ayers]]' backing group The Whole World playing [[bass guitar]]. The band also included [[Electronic keyboard|keyboard]]ist and [[composer]] [[David Bedford]], who quickly befriended Oldfield and encouraged him in his composition of an early version of ''Tubular Bells''. Bedford would later arrange and conduct an orchestral version of that album. With Ayers, Oldfield recorded two albums, ''[[Whatevershebringswesing]]'' and ''[[Shooting at the Moon (album)|Shooting at the Moon]]''. Both albums featured early versions of what would become his trademark sound.

Having recorded a demo version of ''Tubular Bells'', Oldfield attempted to convince someone in the music industry to take the project on, but was told the project was unmarketable. However, in 1972 he met the young [[Richard Branson]] who was setting up his own record label, [[Virgin Records]], and after playing the demo to engineers [[Tom Newman (musician)|Tom Newman]] and [[Simon Heyworth]], he began recording the 1973 version of the album.

=== 1973 <U+2013> 1991: Virgin years ===
''[[Tubular Bells]]'' became Oldfield's most famous work. The instrumental composition was recorded in 1972 and launched on 25 May 1973 as the inaugural album of [[Richard Branson]]'s [[Virgin Records]] label. The album was groundbreaking, as Oldfield played more than twenty different instruments in the [[Overdubbing|multi-layered recording]] made in Branson's [[The Manor Studio|Manor studios]], and its style progressed continuously, covering many diverse musical genres. The album quickly reached the Top 10 of the [[UK album chart]] and has spent 279 weeks on the chart to date, a figure bettered by only ten other albums.{{Fact|date=May 2007}} Its 2,630,000 UK sales put it at No.34 on the list of the best selling albums in the UK. In the [[U.S.]], it received attention chiefly by appearing in the soundtrack to ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''.  The title track subsequently became a Top 10 hit single in the US as well and is today considered to be a forerunner of the New Age movement. In the autumn of 1974, the follow-up LP, ''[[Hergest Ridge (album)|Hergest Ridge]]'', was No.1 in the UK for three weeks before being dethroned by ''Tubular Bells''. Although ''Hergest Ridge'' was released over a year after ''Tubular Bells'', it reached No.1 first. ''Tubular Bells'' spent 11 weeks (10 of them consecutive) at No.2 before its one week at the top. In 1979, ''Tubular Bells'' was used as the main musical score for ''[[The Space Movie]]'', a Virgin movie that celebrated the 10th anniversary of the [[Apollo 11]] mission.  The ''Exorcist'' track is the score used for the landing sequence of the Apollo flights.

Like ''Tubular Bells'', ''Hergest Ridge'' is a two-movement instrumental piece, this time evoking scenes from Oldfield's [[Herefordshire]] country retreat. This was followed in 1975 with the pioneering [[world music]] piece ''[[Ommadawn]]'', and 1978's ''[[Incantations (album)|Incantations]]'' which introduced more diverse choral performances from [[Sally Oldfield]], [[Maddy Prior]] and the [[Queen's College, London|Queen's College]] Girls Choir. Oldfield's 1976 rendition of "[[Portsmouth (Mike Oldfield single)|Portsmouth]]" remains his highest charting single on the [[UK Singles Chart]], reaching number three.

In 1976 Oldfield and [[Sally Oldfield]] joined his friend and band member [[Pekka Pohjola]] to play on his album ''Mathematician's Air Display'' which was released in 1977. The album was recorded and edited at Oldfield's [[Througham Slad Manor]] in [[Gloucestershire]] by Oldfield and Paul Lindsay.

Around the time of ''Incantations'', Oldfield underwent a controversial self-assertiveness therapy course known as [[Exegesis (group)|Exegesis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/articles/78_11.shtml |title=This is the year of the expanding man... |publisher=Karl Dallas <U+2013> Melody Maker |date=1978-11-25 |accessdate=2008-04-02}}</ref> Possibly as a result, the formerly reclusive musician staged a major [[Tour of Europe 1979|European tour]] to promote the album, chronicled in his live album ''[[Exposed (Mike Oldfield album)|Exposed]]'', much of which was recorded at the [[National Exhibition Centre]] near Birmingham, the first-ever concert there.

In 1975, Oldfield received a [[Grammy Awards of 1975|Grammy award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition|Best Instrumental Composition]] in "Tubular Bells <U+2013> Theme from ''The Exorcist''". In 1979, he recorded a version of the [[Blue Peter (Mike Oldfield single)|signature tune]] of the popular British Children's Television programme, ''[[Blue Peter]]'', which was used by the show for 10 years.

The early 1980s saw Oldfield make a transition to "mainstream" popular music, beginning with the inclusion of shorter instrumental tracks and contemporary cover versions on ''[[Platinum (Mike Oldfield album)|Platinum]]'' and ''[[QE2 (album)|QE2]]'' (the latter named after the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|cruise ship]]). Soon afterwards he turned to songwriting, with a string of collaborations featuring various lead vocalists alongside his characteristic searing guitar solos. The best known of these is "[[Moonlight Shadow]]", his 1983 hit with [[Maggie Reilly]]. This song has been covered by various other artists, including [[Aselin Debison]] ([[Canada|Canadian]] [[Folk music|folk]] singer), German duo [[Groove Coverage]] ([[electronic music|electronic]]/[[techno music|techno]]) and [[DJ Mystic]]  ([[electronic music|electronic]]/[[techno music|techno]]).  In 2002 it was a number one hit in central Europe for the German dance act [[Groove Coverage]]. The most successful Oldfield composition on the US pop charts during this period was actually a cover version <U+2014> [[Hall & Oates]]'s remake of Oldfield's "[[Family Man (song)|Family Man]]" for their 1982 album [[H2O (Hall & Oates album)|''H<sub>2</sub>O'']].  Released as the album's third single, it hit the Top 10 during the spring of 1983 and was a hugely popular [[MTV]] music video.

Oldfield later turned to film and video, writing the [[The Killing Fields (album)|score]] for [[Roland Joff<U+00E9>]]'s acclaimed film ''[[The Killing Fields (movie)|The Killing Fields]]'' and producing substantial video footage for his album ''[[Islands (Mike Oldfield album)|Islands]]''. ''Islands'' continued what Oldfield had been doing on the past couple of albums, with an instrumental piece on one side and rock/pop singles on the other. Of these, "[[Islands (Mike Oldfield song)|Islands]]", sung by [[Bonnie Tyler]] and "[[Magic Touch]]", with vocals by [[Max Bacon]] (US version) and Southside Jimmy, a vocalist from [[Glasgow]] (under his real name - Jim Price),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southsidejimmy.co.uk/site/pages/biog.htm |title=Southside Jimmy Biography |publisher=Southside Jimmy |accessdate=2008-11-02}}</ref> (UK/rest of the World) were the major hits. In the USA, Virgin America promoted the song "Magic Touch" to a large extent, making it a success, reaching the top 10 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard album rock charts]]. During the 1980s Oldfield's then partner, Norwegian singer [[Anita Hegerland]], appeared his album and contributed vocals to many songs including "[[Pictures in the Dark]]".

''[[Earth Moving]]'' was released in July 1989, and was a moderate success.  The album was the first to feature rock/pop songs on both sides. Several were released as singles: "Innocent" and "[[(One Glance Is) Holy|Holy]]" in Europe, and "Hostage" in the USA for album rock stations. This was, however, a time of much friction with his record label. [[Virgin Records]] reportedly insisted that any future instrumental album should be billed as ''Tubular Bells 2''. Oldfield's rebellious response was ''[[Amarok (album)|Amarok]]'', an hour-long work featuring rapidly changing themes (supposedly devised to make cutting a single from the album impossible), unpredictable bursts of noise, and a very cleverly hidden [[Morse code]] insult directed at Richard Branson. Although regarded by many fans as his greatest work, it was not a commercial success. His parting shot from the Virgin label was ''[[Heaven's Open]]'', which continued the veiled attacks on Branson but was notable for being the first time Oldfield had contributed all the lead vocals himself, it was the only album that Oldfield released as Michael Oldfield, not Mike Oldfield.

=== 1992 <U+2013> 2003: Warner years ===
The very first thing Oldfield did when arriving at this new label, [[Warner Bros. Records]], and as his final insult to his former label, was to write and release ''[[Tubular Bells II]]'' (the sequel to the first record released by Virgin), which was premiered at a [[Tubular Bells II Live|live concert]] at [[Edinburgh Castle]]. He then continued to embrace new musical styles, with ''[[The Songs of Distant Earth (album)|The Songs of Distant Earth]]'' (based on [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s [[Songs of Distant Earth|novel of the same name]]) exhibiting a softer "[[New Age music|New Age]]" sound. In 1994 he also had an [[asteroid]] named after him, [[5656 Oldfield]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/special/rocknroll/0005656.html |title=Oldfield 5656 |publisher=Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics |accessdate=2008-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/articles/98_09.shtml |title=Mike Oldfield Interview |publisher=BBC Radio 2 |date=1998-09-09 |accessdate=2008-04-02}}</ref>

In 1995 Oldfield further continued to embrace new musical styles by producing a [[celtic music|Celtic]] themed album, ''[[Voyager (Mike Oldfield album)|Voyager]]''. In 1992 Oldfield met [[Luar na Lubre]], a galician Celtic-folk band (from [[A Coru<U+00F1>a]], [[Spain]]). The bands popularity grew after Oldfield heard their song "O son do ar" ("The sound of the air"), which he covered on his ''Voyager'' album.

In 1998 he produced the third ''Tubular Bells'' album, ''[[Tubular Bells III]]'' (also premiered at a [[Tubular Bells III Live|concert]], this time in [[Horse Guards Parade]], [[London]]), drawing from the [[dance music]] scene at his then new home on the island of [[Ibiza]]. This album was still inspired by themes from ''Tubular Bells'', but differed in lacking a clear two part layout.

During 1999 Oldfield released two albums. The first, ''[[Guitars (Mike Oldfield album)|Guitars]]'', used guitars as the source for all the sounds on the album, including percussion. The second, ''[[The Millennium Bell]]'', consisted of pastiches of a number of styles of music that represented various historical stages over the past millennium. The work was [[The Art in Heaven Concert|performed live]] in [[Berlin]] for the city's millennium celebrations in 1999<U+2013>2000.

He added to his repertoire the [[MusicVR]] project, combining his music with a [[virtual reality]]-based computer game. His first work on this project is ''[[Tres Lunas|Tr3s Lunas]]'' launched in 2002, a virtual game where the player can interact with a world full of new music. This project appeared as a double CD, one with the music, and the other with the [[MusicVR#Tres Lunas|game]].

In 2003 he released ''[[Tubular Bells 2003]]'', a re-recording of the original ''Tubular Bells'', on CD, and [[DVD-Audio]]. This was done to "fix" many "imperfections" in the original due to the recording technologies of the early 1970s and limitations in time that he could spend in the recording studio. It celebrated the 30th anniversary of ''Tubular Bells'', Oldfield's 50th birthday and his marriage to Fanny in the same year. The DVD-Audio version has the same content as the CD version in surround, and some demos of the original [[Tubular Bells]]. At around the same time Virgin released an [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] version containing both the original stereo album and the 1975 [[quadraphonic]] mix by [[Phil Newell]].  In the 2003 version, the original voice of the '[[Master of Ceremonies]]' ([[Viv Stanshall]]) was replaced by the voice of [[John Cleese]], Stanshall having died in the interim.

=== 2004 <U+2013> present: Mercury years === 
[[File:Mike Oldfield NOTP 2006.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mike Oldfield at [[Night of the Proms]] (December 2006)]]
On 12 April 2004 Oldfield launched his next [[virtual reality]] project, ''[[MusicVR|Maestro]]'', which contains music from the ''Tubular Bells 2003'' album and also some new [[chillout]] melodies.  The games have since been made available free of charge on Oldfield's website. A double album, ''[[Light + Shade]]'', was released on [[Mercury Records]], with whom Mike had recently signed a three album deal. The two discs contain music of contrasting moods, one relaxed (''Light'') and the other more edgy and moody (''Shade''). The album was released on 26 September 2005.  ''Light'' includes a selection of tracks from the album in [[U-MYX]] format, which allows listeners to create their own remixes. Oldfield headlined the [[Germany|German]] [[Night of the Proms]] tour, consisting of 18 concerts in December 2006.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.notp.com/?country=de&menuitem=2 | title=Nokia Night of the Proms 2006 |publisher=Night of the Proms |accessdate=2006-06-01}}</ref>

His autobiography ''[[Changeling (Mike Oldfield)|Changeling]]'' was published in May 2007 by [[Virgin Books]].<ref name=resolution>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/articles/07_03.shtml |title=Craft: Mike Oldfield |publisher=Resolution Magazine |date=2007-03 |accessdate=2008-04-02}}</ref> In March 2008 Oldfield released his first classical album, ''[[Music of the Spheres (Mike Oldfield album)|Music of the Spheres]]''; [[Karl Jenkins]] assisted with the orchestration.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.classicsandjazz.co.uk/tssite/homepage.do?ruleset=artist&id=51402037 |title=Mike Oldfield artist details |publisher=Universal Classics and Jazz |accessdate=2008-04-02}}</ref> In the first week of release the album topped the [[UK Classical chart]] and reached number 9 on the main UK Album Chart. A single, "[[Spheres (song)|Spheres]]", featuring a demo version of pieces from the album was released digitally. The album was nominated for a Classical Brit Award, the [[NS&I]] Best Album of 2009.

In mid-2008 to accompany the [[BBC2]] television series ''[[Amazon (2008 TV series)|Amazon]]'', an album was released in support of the [[Survival International]] charity, called ''[[Songs for Survival]]'', on which Oldfield recorded an exclusive song.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teletext.co.uk/planetsound/news/3374790848323d90a6c099afcc851183/Coldplay+and+A-ha+team+up.aspx |title=Coldplay and A-ha team up |publisher=[[Teletext]] |accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref> Oldfield's daughter, Molly, played a large part in the project and Oldfield's track "Song for Survival" features the [[Anuta]] tribe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kensaltownrecords.com/tracklisting.html |title=Survival Project - Album Track listing |publisher=Kensaltown Records |accessdate=2008-08-25}}</ref>

In 2008 when Oldfield's original 35 year deal with Virgin Records ended, the rights to ''Tubular Bells'' and his other Virgin releases were returned to him,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article3431337.ece |title=Mike Oldfield regains control of ''Tubular Bells'' |date=2008-03-01 |accessdate=2008-04-05 |publisher=[[The Times]]}}</ref> and then they were transferred to [[Mercury Records]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tubular.net/archives/ |title=News Archives |publisher=Tubular.net |date=2005-06-03 |accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> Mercury issued a press release on 15 April 2009, noting that Oldfield's Virgin albums would be re-released, starting 8 June 2009. These releases include special features from the archives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mikeoldfield.org/news/150409.htm |title=Universal press release - ''Tubular Bells'' |date=2009-04-15 |publisher=Mike Oldfield Information Service |accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> In April 2009 a new official website was unveiled, and on 6 June 2009, an International Bell Ringing day took place, to promote the reissue of his first album, ''Tubular Bells''.

=== Personal life ===
Oldfield and his siblings were raised [[Roman Catholic]], the faith of their [[Irish People|Irish]] mother.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/articles/02_08d.shtml |title=Interview with Mike Oldfield |publisher=[[BBC 1]]'s ''[[Heaven and Earth Show|Heaven and Earth]]'' programme |date=2002-08-25 |accessdate=2008-04-02 |quote=My mother being Irish, she was a Roman Catholic. They put me on the first stages of educating me to be a Catholic}}</ref> In the late 1970s, Oldfield briefly married Diana D'Aubigny (the sister of the [[Exegesis (group)|Exegesis]] group leader), but this lasted just a few weeks.

Mike Oldfield has seven children. In the early 1980s, he had three children with Sally Cooper (Molly, Dougal and Luke). In the late 1980s, he had two children (Greta and Noah) with [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[singer]] [[Anita Hegerland]]. In the 2000s, he married Fanny Oldfield (n<U+00E9>e Vandekerckhove, born 1977), whom he met during his time in Ibiza; they have two sons together (Jake and Eugene).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article3431337.ece |title=Mike Oldfield regains control of ''Tubular Bells'' |publisher=[[The Times]] |date=2008-03-01 |accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref>

Oldfield is a motorcycle fan, and has five bikes.  These include a [[BMW R1200GS]], a [[Suzuki GSX-R750]], a [[Suzuki GSX-R1000]] and a [[Yamaha R1]]. He also says that some of his inspiration for composing comes from riding them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.motorcyclenews.com/MCN/News/newsresults/mcn/2007/May/may21-27/may2307oldfieldbikesvideo/ |title=Mike Oldfield Motorcycle News 23 may |publisher=MCN |date=2007-05-25 |accessdate=2008-04-01}}</ref>  Throughout his life Oldfield has also had a passion for aircraft and building model aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amarok.ommadawn.net/mike/discog/extras/ommadawnnotes.htm |title=''Ommadawn'' |publisher=Rob Miles (amarok.ommadawn.net) |accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref>  He is also a licensed pilot<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608001097/Mike-Oldfield.html |title=Mike Oldfield biography |publisher=Musician Guide |accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref> and has flown fixed wing aircraft, the first of which was a [[Beechcraft Musketeer|Beechcraft Sierra]] and helicopters including the [[Bell 47|Agusta Bell 47G]] which featured on the sleeve of his cover-version of the [[ABBA]] song [[Arrival (song)|"Arrival"]] as a parody of their [[Arrival (ABBA album)|album artwork]].  He is also interested in cars and has owned a [[Ferrari]] and a [[Bentley]] which was a gift from Richard Branson as an incentive for him to give his first live performance of ''Tubular Bells''.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Losing My Virginity]] |first=Richard |last=Branson |authorlink=Richard Branson |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |isbn=978-0753506486}}</ref> He has endorsed the [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class]] in the Mercedes UK magazine.  Oldfield also considers himself to be a [[Trekkie]] (fan of the popular science fiction television series ''[[Star Trek]]'').<ref name=fivemin>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/the-5minute-interview-mike-oldfield-musician-805480.html |title=The 5-minute Interview: Mike Oldfield, Musician |publisher=The Independent |date=2008-04-07 |accessdate=2008-07-13}}</ref> He also noted in an interview in 2008 that he had two boats.<ref name=fivemin/>

In November 2006, fellow musician [[Noel Gallagher]] won a [[Spain|Spanish]] court case against Oldfield. Gallagher had bought an [[Ibiza]] villa for <U+00A3>2.5 million from Oldfield in 1999, but quickly discovered that part of the cliff-top property was falling into the sea. The resulting court case awarded Gallagher a six-figure sum in compensation. Suspicion abounds in the music industry that the law-suit was initiated because of embarrassment that Gallagher brought on himself by not having a proper survey done on the property before buying it. This included making an immediate and noisy complaint about someone's yacht tied up at the villa's jetty before it was pointed out that the yacht came with the villa and was, in fact, his.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,4-2006520333,00.html |title=Noel gets home win over Mike |publisher=[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]] |date=2006-11-10 |accessdate=2008-04-01}}</ref>

In 2007 Oldfield caused a minor stir in the British press by criticizing Britain for being too controlling and over protective, specifically, concentrating on the smoking ban, which England and Wales introduced that year.  Oldfield then moved from his [[Gloucestershire]] home to [[Palma de Mallorca]], [[Spain]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/buying_and_selling/article2737168.ece |title=Ringing the changes |publisher=The Times |date=2007-20-28 |accessdate=2008-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23417490-details/Mike%20Oldfield%20quits%20'prep%20school%20Britain'%20over%20smoking%20ban/article.do |title=Mike Oldfield quits 'prep school Britain' over smoking ban |publisher=[[Evening Standard|This is London]] |date=2007-10-21 |accessdate=2008-04-01}}</ref> Oldfield has lived outside the UK in the past, including living in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Ibiza]] in the 1990s and [[Switzerland]] in the mid-1980s, for tax reasons.

== Instruments ==
Oldfield is a [[multi-instrumentalist]]; however he considers himself to be predominantly a guitarist.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.recordproduction.com/mike-oldfield-interview.html |title=Mike Oldfield video interview |publisher=RecordProduction.com |format=HTML/[[Quicktime]] video |accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref> For a large list of Oldfield's instruments, past and present, see [http://tubular.net/instruments/ the Instruments section] at Tubular.net.

=== Guitars ===
Over the years Oldfield has used a various selection of guitars, some of the most noted being:
* A 1963 (also quoted as 1961 and 1962) salmon pink (fiesta red) [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]] serial no.L08044  <U+2013>  Used by Oldfield from 1984 (Discovery album) until 2006 (Night of the Proms, rehearsals in Antwerp) <U+2013>  Sold for <U+00A3>30,000 at Chandler Guitars.
* A 1989 amber [[PRS Guitars|PRS]] Artist Custom 24 <U+2013>  Used by Oldfield from the late 1980s to the present day.
* A 1966 blonde [[Fender Telecaster]] serial no. 180728 <U+2013>  The only electric guitar used on ''Tubular Bells'' and also previously owned by [[Marc Bolan]]<ref name=roland>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/articles/99_06.shtml |title=Interview with Mike Oldfield |publisher=Roland PowerOn magazine (Issue 4), |date=1999-06-06 |accessdate=2008-04-01}}</ref> <U+2013>  Went up for auction at [[Bonhams]] in June 2007, with the money going to the [[SANE (charity)|SANE]] charity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bonhams.com/cgi-bin/wspd_cgi.sh/pubweb/publicSite.r?sContinent=EUR&screen=lotdetailsNoFlash&iSaleItemNo=3596185&iSaleNo=15242 |title=Sale 15242 - Film and Rock & Roll Memorabilia |date=2007-06-20 |publisher=Bonhams |accessdate=2008-04-01}}</ref>
* Various [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul]] and [[Gibson SG|SG]]s <U+2013>  Used by Oldfield extensively in the 1970s and 80s.

Oldfield used a modified [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] GP8 effects processor in conjunction with his PRS Artist to get many of his heavily overdriven guitar sounds from the ''[[Earth Moving]]'' album onwards.<ref name=roland/>Oldfield has also been using [[Guitar synthesizer]]s since the mid-1980s, using a 1980s Roland GR-300/G-808 type system, then a 1990s Roland GK2 equipped red PRS Custom 24 (sold in 2006) with a Roland VG8,<ref name=roland/> and most recently a [[Line 6]] [[Variax]]. 

Oldfield has an unusual playing style, using both fingers and fingernails and several ways of creating vibrato: a "very fast side-to-side vibrato" or "violinist's vibrato".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/articles/95_06.shtml |title=Gareth Randall Interviews Mike Oldfield |date=1995-06-01 |accessdate=2008-04-01}}</ref> Oldfield has also stated that his playing style originates from his musical roots playing folk music and the bass guitar.<ref name=changeling/>

=== Recording ===
Oldfield has self-recorded and produced many of his albums, and played the majority of the instruments that appear on them, largely at his home [[Recording studio|studios]]. In the 1990s and 2000s Oldfield has been mainly using [[Digital audio workstation|DAWs]] such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Logic Pro|Logic]], [[Digidesign]] [[Pro Tools]] and [[Steinberg]] Nuendo as recording suites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/articles/95_02.shtml |title=Tubular Worlds |publisher=Sound On Sound |date=1995-02 |accessdate=2008-04-01}}</ref> For composing classical music Oldfield has been quoted as using the software notation program, [[Sibelius (computer program)|Sibelius]],<ref name=resolution/> combined with Apple [[Macintosh]]es.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.eu.org/mike_mac_format0408.jpg |title=I use my Mac for... Composing music |publisher=[[MacFormat]] |date=2008-04 |accessdate=2008-04-01}}</ref> He also used the [[FL Studio]] DAW on his 2005 double album ''[[Light + Shade]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flstudio.com/documents/mikeoldfield.html |title=Interview of Mike Oldfield by Image-Line |publisher=Image-Line |accessdate=2008-09-11}}</ref> Among the mixing consoles Oldfield has owned are an [[AMS Neve]] Capricorn 33238 and a [[Euphonix]] System 5-MC.

=== Keyboards ===
Over the years Oldfield has owned and used a vast number of synthesizers and other keyboard instruments.<!-- Add some further examples if you wish --> In the 1980s Oldfield composed the score for the film ''[[The Killing Fields (film)|The Killing Fields]]'' on a [[Fairlight]] [[Fairlight CMI|CMI]].<ref name=roland/>  Some examples of keyboard and synthesized instruments which Oldfield has made use of includes [[Sequential Circuits]] Prophets (notably on [[Platinum (Mike Oldfield album)|''Platinum'']]) , Roland 1080/2080 units (in the 1990s), a [[Korg]] [[Korg M1|M1]] (as seen in the "[[Innocent (Mike Oldfield song)|Innocent]]" video), a [[Clavia]] [[Nord Lead]] and [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] pianos among an almost endless list of others.  In recent years Oldfield has also made use of software synthesis, such as [[Native Instruments]] products, notably on his ''Light + Shade'' album.
