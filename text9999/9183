In the  [[history of video games]], the '''seventh generation''' primarily focuses on the consoles released since {{vgy|2005}} by [[Nintendo]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Sony]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Sakazaki|first=Lloyd|url= http://seekingalpha.com/article/22075-seventh-generation-gaming-consoles-thinking-outside-the-box|title=Seventh Generation Gaming Consoles: Thinking Outside the Box|publisher=Seeking Alpha|date= 2006-12-11|accessdate=2008-06-08}}</ref>

Each new console introduced a new type of breakthrough technology. For example, the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 offered [[High-definition video|high-definition]] graphics, the Wii focused on integrating [[Wii Remote|controllers]] with [[Wii Remote#Sensing|movement sensors]] instead of using [[joystick]]s<ref>{{cite web|last=Wisniowski|first=Howard|url= http://www.analog.com/en/press-release/May_09_2006_ADI_Nintendo_Collaboration/press.html|title=Analog Devices And Nintendo Collaboration Drives Video Game Innovation With iMEMS Motion Signal Processing Technology|publisher=Analog Devices, Inc.|date= 2006-05-09|accessdate=2006-05-10}}</ref> (the PlayStation 3 also employs motion sensitivity, but to a lesser degree). Most of consoles have [[wireless]] controllers, while the Xbox 360 also has wired controllers as an alternative. The PlayStation 3 controller can be charged through the use of a USB-A/mini-b cable. The wireless Xbox 360 controller uses either a rechargeable battery pack or 2 AA batteries; the same can be said about the Wii.

For handheld consoles, the seventh generation began on November 21, 2004 with the North American introduction of the [[Nintendo DS]] as a "third pillar", alongside Nintendo's existing [[Game Boy Advance]] and [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]] consoles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.n-sider.com/contentview.php?contentid=515|title=Various Satoru Iwata comments regarding the Nintendo DS|author=Glen Bayer|publisher=N-sider.com|date=2004-03-01|accessdate=2007-10-04}}</ref> The Nintendo DS features a touch screen and built-in [[microphone]], and supports wireless [[IEEE 802.11]] ([[Wi-Fi]]) standards.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.darkain.com/nintendo_ds/nifi.php | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050217195147/http://www.darkain.com/nintendo_ds/nifi.php | archivedate=2005-02-17 | title=Nintendo DS - WI-FI vs NI-FI | author=Darkain |date=2005-01-21 | accessdate=2006-04-02}}</ref> More recently, the new [[DSi]] features many new things including two built in cameras, the ability to download games from the DSi store, and a web browser.

=== Xbox 360 ===
{{main|Xbox 360}}

[[Microsoft]]'s Xbox 360 gained an early lead in terms of market share, largely due to its established [[Xbox Live]] online gaming system, and its early launch date which was one year before its rivals. Sales in North America and Europe have continued to be strong, even after the release of the [[Wii]] and [[PlayStation 3]]. Like its predecessor, the Xbox 360 received a muted reception in Japan,<ref>{{cite news|title=Muted hello for Xbox 360 in Japan|publisher=BBC|date=2005-12-10|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4517362.stm|accessdate=2007-10-28}}</ref> attributed to the lack of content aimed at Japanese gamers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fildes|first=Johnathan|title=Xbox still hopes to storm Japan|publisher=BBC|date=2006-09-23|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/5373066.stm|accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref>

This early launch did come with some trouble, as [[Xbox 360 technical problems|technical problems]] appeared in a portion of Xbox 360 units sold. The most well known problem is the "[[Xbox 360 technical problems#Three flashing red lights|red ring of death]]", which received a great deal of attention due to some users' claims of having to replace their consoles multiple times. Microsoft addressed this by offering a three year warranty on all affected consoles and repairing them free of charge.<ref name="moneyback">{{cite web |title=Xbox 360 Warranty Coverage Expanded |publisher=Microsoft |date=2007-07-05 |url=http://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/xbox360/hardware/warranty/warrantyupdate/WarrantyUpdate.aspx |accessdate =2007-10-25}}</ref> It also [[retroactive]]ly reimbursed owners of affected systems who paid for repairs.<ref name="moneyback"/> According to ''[[The Mercury News]]'', new models of the console featuring 65-nanometer technology will address this and other issues; the new technology is expected to reduce heat production, which will lower the risk of overheating and system failures; although, this has never been officially confirmed by Microsoft.<ref>{{cite web |last=Takahashi |first=Dean |title=Microsoft<U+2019>s next move?

Similar to the RRoD, it's an error screen that appears on your 360. 

As they share many cross-platform games and compete for the same audience as their predecessors, frequent comparisons are made between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.<ref>{{cite web |date=2005-05-20 |last=Perry |first=Douglass |publisher=IGN |title=E3 2005: Microsoft's Xbox 360 vs. Sony's PlayStation 3 |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/617/617951p1.html |accessdate=2008-05-14}}</ref> The PS3 uses the [[Blu-ray]] format, while the Xbox 360 uses a standard [[DVD9]].

[[Sony]]'s PlayStation 3 was released on November 11, 2006 in Japan and November 17, 2006 in USA and Canada. The system's reliance on new technology such as the [[Cell microprocessor]] and [[Blu-ray]] format has caused difficulties in manufacturing, especially the Blu-ray diode, leading to shortages at launch and the delay of the [[PAL region]] launches; however, by early December 2006, Sony announced that all production issues had been resolved.<ref>{{cite web| last =Graft| first =Kris| title =PS3 Manufacturing Troubles 'Solved'| publisher =Next Generation| date =[[2006-12-08]]| url =http://www.edge-online.com/news/sony-ps3-mfg-troubles-resolved| accessdate =2007-10-25}}</ref>

Sony will provide support for its console with new titles from acclaimed first-party franchises such as ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]'' and ''[[God of War (video game)|God of War]]'', and secured a number of highly anticipated third-party exclusive titles, including ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots|Metal Gear Solid 4]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy Versus XIII]].''

As in previous generations, Nintendo has provided strong support for its new console with popular first-party franchises like ''[[Mario (series)|Mario]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda (series)|The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[Metroid (series)|Metroid]]'', and ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon (video games)|Pok<U+00E9>mon]]'', among others. To appeal to casual and non-gamers, Nintendo has also created the ''[[Wii Series]]'' of games, where players make use of the motion-sensing abilities of the console and its peripherals to simulate real world activities, such as sports, table games, music, or doing exercises.<ref>{{cite web | title = Wii Sports Part 1: A Truly Ground-breaking Collection of Games | publisher = [[Nintendo]] | url =http://wiiportal.nintendo-europe.com/135.html | accessdate =2007-12-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Wii Sports Part 4: Games That Even the People Watching Can Enjoy | publisher = [[Nintendo]] | url =http://wiiportal.nintendo-europe.com/142.html | accessdate =2007-12-12}}</ref>

Publishers such as [[Ubisoft]], [[EA]], [[Capcom]], and [[Majesco Entertainment|Majesco]] continue to release exclusive titles for the console, but the Wii's strongest titles still remain within its first-party line-up. Analysts speculated that this will change in time as the Wii's growing popularity persuades third-party publishers to focus on it;<ref name="regain"/><ref>{{cite news | last =Wingfield | first =Nick | coauthors =Iwatani Kane, Yukari  | title =Wii and DS Turn Also-Ran Nintendo Into Winner in Videogames Business | publisher =Wall Street Journal | date =[[2007-04-19]] | url =http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB117691936534774315-0q7Hxbw4nJnlZXw0F_ZCD6Dx5MI_20080418.html?mod=blogs | accessdate = 2007-12-12 }}</ref> however, some third party developers are beginning to express frustration at low software sales. [[Goichi Suda]], developer of ''[[No More Heroes (video game)|No More Heroes]]'' for the Wii, noted that "only Nintendo titles are doing well. This isn't just because of the current situation in Japan, as this is happening outside Japan. I am very surprised about the reality about Wii, because before I was making this game, I wasn't expecting that Wii would be a console targeted only for non-gamers. I expected more games for hardcore gamers. The reality is different to what I expected."<ref>{{cite web| last= Hicks | first= Chris | title=Suda 51: Third party Wii games aren<U+2019>t selling |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=179648 | publisher=[[Computer and Video Games|CVG]]| date= [[2008-01-16]] | accessdate= 2008-01-25}}</ref> Conversely, the PAL publisher of ''No More Heroes'' [[Rising Star Games]] were greatly impressed with the games sales.<ref>[http://www.mcvuk.com/news/29950/Rising-Star-enjoys-Wii-chart-success Rising Star enjoys Wii chart success - www.mcvuk.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Goichi Suda later retracted his comment, saying his "point was that ''No More Heroes'', unlike a lot of Nintendo Wii titles currently available is the kind of product which will attract a different kind of consumer to the hardware, ''i.e.'' gamers who are looking for a different genre to the products which have been successful on this platform thus far."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grasshopper.co.jp/ |title=Suda 51: Retracted Comment  |accessdate=2008-01-21 |date=2008-01-20 |publisher=Grasshopper Manufacture}}</ref>

In early 2008, the [[NPD Group]] revealed sales data showing that, while the Wii's life-to-date [[attach rate]] is low, in December 2007, it reached 8.11<U+2014>higher than the attach rates for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in that month.<ref>{{cite web |last=Casamassina |first= Matt | title= Wii Tie Ratio at 8:1 in December | url= http://wii.ign.com/articles/847/847472p1.html | publisher= IGN | date= [[2008-01-24]]| accessdate=2008-01-25}}</ref> The Wii's low overall attach rate could be explained by reference to its rapidly increasing [[installed base]], as financial analysts have pointed to the Xbox 360's high attach rates as indicative of an unhealthy lack of installed base growth, and warned that what actually benefits third-party developers is <U+201C>quicker adoption of hardware and a rapidly growing installed base on which to sell progressively more game units,<U+201D> which tends to lower the attach rate of a product.<ref>{{cite web |last= Dobson |first= Jason | title = Opinion: Xbox 360 Software Attach Rate Is 'Alarming' | url= http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11796 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | date= [[2006-11-21]]| accessdate=2008-01-25}}</ref>

==== Backward compatibility ====

The [[Wii]] and the original two models of the [[PlayStation 3]] are fully [[Backward compatibility|backwards compatible]] with titles from their previous counterparts and the Wii also offers support for some of [[Nintendo GameCube|its predecessor's]] accessories. Later versions of the PlayStation 3 and all models of the [[Xbox 360]] only offer partial support and use [[software emulation]] for backwards compatibility. Current versions of the PS3 do not offer [[PlayStation 2]] compatibility at all, though [[PlayStation|PS1]] compatibility is retained. The Xbox 360's compatibility is increased through game-specific [[Patch (computing)|patches]] automatically downloaded from Xbox Live or downloaded and burned to a CD or DVD from the Xbox website<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/backwardcompatibilitygameslist.htm|publisher=Xbox.com |title=Xbox 360 - Original Xbox Games on Xbox 360<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref> and the PS3's compatibility is expanded with firmware updates. All three consoles provide titles from older consoles for download; the Xbox 360 through the [[List of Xbox Originals|Xbox Originals]] service, the PlayStation 3 through the [[PlayStation Store]], and the Wii through the [[Virtual Console]]. When purchased, the game requested is then saved to the console's internal memory.

==== High definition and enhanced definition video ====

Both the [[PlayStation 3]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.us.playstation.com/Support/PS3/GettingStarted/default.html|title=Setting Up the PLAYSTATION3|publisher=SCEA|author=SCEA|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> and the [[Xbox 360]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/xbox-360/shane-kim-talks-360-1080p-game-output-201816.php|title=Shane Kim Talks 360 1080p Game Output|publisher=Kotaku|author=Brian Crecente|date=2006-09-20|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> support [[1080p]] [[high definition video]] output. However, the output signal may be protected by [[digital rights management]] and may require an [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection|HDCP]]-compliant display if [[HDMI]] is used. The [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] service and the United States' [[PlayStation Store]] offer HD movies, TV shows, movie trailers and clips for download to the console's HDD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/e32007/articles/disneystudiosnowonmarketplace.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070713223845/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/e32007/articles/disneystudiosnowonmarketplace.htm|archivedate=2007-07-13|title=Walt Disney Studios now on XBox Marketpalce|publisher=Xbox.com|accessdate=2008-05-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.us.playstation.com/News/PressReleases/480| title=PLAYSTATIONNetwork's Video Delivery Service to Offer Movies and TV Shows for Purchase and TV Shows for Purchase and Rental Through PLAYSTATION3 and PSP (PlayStationPortable)| date=2008-07-15| publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment America| accessdate=2008-10-06}}</ref> Other PlayStation Stores only feature movie trailers and clips for video download.

While only a small number of games [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] the video output in full 1080p, all games can be automatically scaled to this resolution.

The Wii is capable of outputting 480p for the Wii Menu and most games through a component cable which must be purchased separately.

== Handheld systems ==
{{seealso|Comparison of handheld game consoles}}



For [[handheld game console|video game handhelds]], the seventh generation began with the release of the [[Nintendo DS]] on November 21, 2004. This handheld was based on a design fundamentally different from the [[Game Boy]] and other handheld video game systems. The Nintendo DS offered new modes of input over previous generations such as a touch screen, the ability to connect wirelessly using IEE 802.11b, as well as a microphone to speak to in-game NPCs.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.darkain.com/nintendo_ds/nifi.php | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050217195147/http://www.darkain.com/nintendo_ds/nifi.php | archivedate=2005-02-17 | title=Nintendo DS - WI-FI vs NI-FI | author=Darkain |date=2005-01-21 | accessdate=2008-05-17}}</ref> On December 12, 2004, Sony released its first handheld, [[PlayStation Portable]]. The PlayStation Portable was marketed at launch to an above 25 year old<ref>{{cite web  |last=Brightman |first=James |title=SCEA: PSP Will Be Big Revenue Driver |publisher=GameDaily |date=2007-06-26 |url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/scea-psp-will-be-big-revenue-driver/70598/ |accessdate=2007-11-05 }}</ref> or "core gamer" market,<ref>{{cite web |last=Sheffield |first=Brandon |title=What's the Dille?

[[Nokia Corporation]] plans to revive its [[N-Gage]] platform in the form of a service for selected [[S60 platform|S60]] devices. [[N-Gage 2.0|This new service]] launched on April 3, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.n-gage.com/ngi/ngage/web/g0/en/community/articles.Detail.general-anewdayforngage.1.html |title= A New Day for N-Gage |publisher=Nokia |accessdate=2008-04-03}}</ref>

Other less-popular handheld systems released during this generation include the [[Gizmondo]] (launched on 19 March 2005 and discontinued in February 2006) and the [[GP2X]] (launched on 10 November 2005 and discontinued in August 2008). The [[GP2X Wiz]], [[Pandora (console)|Pandora]] and [[Gizmondo 2]] are due to be released in 2009.

Another aspect of the seventh generation was the beginning of direct competition between dedicated handheld gaming devices, and increasingly powerful pda/cellphone devices such as the [[iPhone]] and various devices powered by [[Windows Mobile]].  Simple games such as tetris and solitare had existed for PDA devices since their introduction, but by 2009 PDAs and phones had grown sufficiently powerful to where complex graphical games could be implemented, with the advantage of distribution over wireless broadband.
