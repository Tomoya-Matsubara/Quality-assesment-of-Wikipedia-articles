'''Randolph Evans''' ([[1961]] - [[1976]]) was a 15-year old [[Brooklyn]] boy who was shot and killed by [[NYPD]] officer Robert Torsney on [[November 26]], [[1976]]. Evans was a ninth-grader at [[Franklin K. Lane High School]] in Brooklyn at the time of the shooting.
==Shooting==
On [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] 1976, responding to a report of a man with a gun in the Cypress Hills [[housing projects]], Officer Torsney encountered a group of youths. After a brief conversation, Torsney shot one of them, Evans, point-blank in the head. He then ran to his car and drove back to the [[75th precinct]] where he was arrested.<ref>Seigel, Max H. "Boy, 15, Shot to Death Point-Blank; Officer Arrested in East New York" [[New York Times]], November 27, 1976, p. 1.</ref>

==Legal Proceedings==
On [[November 30]], [[1976]], the day of Evans' funeral, Torsney was indicted by a [[grand jury]] on charges of [[second-degree murder]]. At the trial of Torsney, which began in October, 1977, his defense maintained that the killing resulted from a psychotic episode due to an epileptic condition. Torsney's attorney maintained this illness was the [[Automatism (medical)|automatism]] [[Wilder Penfield|of Penfield]], named for neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield. On [[November 30]], [[1977]], one year after Evans' funeral, Torsney was found [[not guilty by reason of insanity]]<ref>Dunning, Jennifer. "Officer Torsney Acquitted as Jury Rules Him Insane in Killing of Boy" [[New York Times]], December 1, 1977, p. 1.</ref>. Torsney was remanded to a state [[mental hospital]].
==Torsney's Release and Aftermath==
On December 20, 1978 a Brooklyn State Supreme Court ordered Torsney's release, stating he no longer posed a threat to society. The Torsney case was mentioned by [[Bob Herbert]] in his [[New York Times]] column after the shooting of [[Sean Bell]] which took place nearly exactly 30 years to the day after the killing of Evans. <ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05EFD9113EF933A05752C1A9609C8B63 "Badges, Guns and Another Unarmed Victim"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[November 30]], [[2006]], accessed [[March 31]], [[2008]].</ref>
