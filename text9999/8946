'''The Civilians''' is an investigative [[theatre company]] in [[New York City]] founded in 2001 by Artistic Director [[Steve Cosson]]. The Civilians artists pursue their inquiries using interviews, community residencies, research, and other methods.<ref>Grode, Eric. [http://nymag.com/arts/all/indie/52576 <U+201C>Big Ideas, Small Stages,<U+201D> ''New York Magazine'' (November 30, 2008).]</ref> Working with this dynamic combination of journalism and art, The Civilians creates theatrical events that promote an inquisitive curiosity about the world and an engagement with the most vital questions of the present.<ref>Eisler, Garrett. [http://stage-directions.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1056&Itemid=75 <U+201C>Social Work,<U+201D> ''Stage Directions'' (September 8, 2008).]</ref>  The company has utilized this method of diligent research in the creation of each of their seven original plays. According to ''Variety Magazine'', The Civilians "travels far and wide researching a piece around a given subject, conducting interviews and comparing notes along the way, sometimes for years."<ref name="Variety">Thielman, Sam.

== Company history ==
Artistic Director Steve Cosson founded the company in 2001, with a multi-disciplinary group of artists including some fellow [[University of California-San Diego]] graduates, as <U+201C>a breeding ground for new styles of collaboration<U+201D><ref>Estvanik, Nicole. [http://www.thecivilians.org/news_2004_atm.html. "'''The Civilians''' What do You Believe?" ''American Theatre Magazine'' (December 2004).]</ref>  Inspiration was taken from the British [[Joint Stock Theatre Company]], Cosson having studied under director and Joint Stock member [[Les Waters]] at UCSD.<ref>LaBelle, Devon. [http://www.actorstheatre.org/HUMANA%20FESTIVAL%20CDROM/humana_thisbeautifulcity.pdf. "The Civilians"]</ref> Cosson has said <U+201C>I wanted to create a theatre that would engage with larger social, cultural, and political realities through the eyes of real, ordinary people, or 'civilians.'<U+201D><ref>Bowen, Kirsten. [http://www.amrep.org/articles/4_4b/civilians.html. "The Civilians Have a Few Questions for YOU!" ''American Repertory Theater'' (April, 2006).]</ref> In keeping with this desire, the name of the company is derived from the old [[vaudeville]] term for those not within the vaudeville community. The Civilians both operates outside of the typical show-business world as well as looks out into the populace, the world of <U+201C>civilians<U+201D> for the inspiration and content of their work.<ref>Eisler, Garrett. [http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/37205087/Social-Work. "Social Work" ''Stage Directions'' (September 2008).]</ref> 

Since its founding in 2001, The Civilians<U+2019> projects have been produced at venues throughout New York, including [[The Public Theatre]], [[Joe's Pub]], [[St. Ann's Warehouse]], [[59E59 Theaters]], and the [[Vineyard Theatre]] among others, and at theaters nationally, including The [[Center Theatre Group]] (at the [[Mark Taper Forum]]), [[Studio Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Studio Theatre]], [[A.R.T.]], [[La Jolla Playhouse]], HBO<U+2019>s [[U.S. Comedy Arts Festival]], and [[Actors Theatre of Louisville]]. Works by the company have also toured nationally and internationally to universities, arts presenters and festivals. 

The Civilians made its UK debut with ''Gone Missing'' in 2004 at the [[Gate Theatre]], and ''(I Am) Nobody<U+2019>s Lunch'' was a Fringe First Award winner at the 2006 [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]], leading to a London production at the [[Soho Theatre]]. The Civilians<U+2019> commercial run of ''Gone Missing'' at the [[Barrow Street Theatre]] ran for seven months and was included in several Top 10 of 2007 lists in the New York press, including critic Charles Isherwood<U+2019>s list in ''The New York Times''.<ref>Hernandez, Ernio. "Best In Show: ''August'', ''Dividing the Estate'' and ''Gypsy'' Top 2007 "Best of" Lists," Playbill (January 4, 2008.)</ref>

In addition to the successful productions, The Civilians<U+2019> work has been published in a number of formats. ''Gone Missing'' was published by [[Dramatists Play Service]] in 2009, following its inclusion in the publication of ''(I Am) Nobody<U+2019>s Lunch'' by [[Oberon Books]] in 2007. In 2009, [[Playscripts, Inc.]] published an anthology of all of the Civilians' works to date, excluding ''This Beautiful City'', which was still running at The Vineyard Theater. Additionally, an original cast recording of ''Gone Missing'' was released by [[Ghostlight Records]] in 2008.

== Structure ==
According to The Civilians' website:

{{blockquote|The artistic foundation of The Civilians is a group of Associate Artists including directors, writers, actors, designers, choreographers, and composers. Each year, the company invites several artists to join as new Associate Artists. The company realizes its projects through a network of collaborative partnerships. Many projects are developed with the support of partners including universities, institutional theaters and artist residency programs. Projects often tour to both performing arts presenters and regional theaters.<ref>"The Company," The Civilians' official website.</ref>}}

== Works ==

=== Canard, Canard, Goose? (2002) ===

''Canard, Canard, Goose?'' was the company<U+2019>s first production, premiering in 2002 at [[HERE Arts Center]] in New York City. The play was devised and created by the company, directed by Steve Cosson, with music and lyrics by [[Michael Friedman (composer)|Michael Friedman]].<ref>Cosson, Steven. "Canard, Canard, Goose?." ''The Civilians''. Ed. Steven Cosson. New York: Playscripts, Inc, 2008.</ref> The play deals with "rumors of maltreated geese during the making of ''[[Fly Away Home]]'', the sentimental 1996 Disney flick that featured [[Anna Paquin]] leading geese south in an ultra-light plane."<ref name="Time Out">Cote, David. [http://www.thecivilians.org/news_2002_tony.html <U+201C>Reviews: Canard, Canard, Goose?<U+201D> ''Time Out New York'' (February 7, 2008).]</ref> According to ''Time Out: New York'', "The middle part of the show includes funny but affectionate impersonations of the eccentric and lonely folks who live in that remote hamlet. After two days of interviews, however, the group discovers that ''Fly Away Home'' was actually filmed in Ontario. Songs and silly dances are interspersed among the members' increasingly desperate updates on their deteriorating investigation."<ref name="Time Out" />

=== The Ladies (2004) ===

''The Ladies'' was written by [[Anne Washburn]] and directed by [[Anne Kauffman]], both Associate Artists of the company. The play presents the characters of [[Eva Peron]], [[Imelda Marcos]], [[Elena Ceausescu]], and [[Jiang Qing]], as well as the artists themselves. It premiered at [[Dixon Place]] in New York City in 2004.

=== Paris Commune (2004, 2008) ===

''Paris Commune'' illustrates the story of the Parisian uprising of 1871, the first socialist rebellion in Europe. The piece was developed as a part of [[La Jolla Playhouse]]<U+2019>s Page-to-Stage program in 2004,<ref name="dePoyen">de Poyen, Jennifer.

=== Gone Missing (2007) ===

{{main|Gone Missing (play)}}
''Gone Missing'' premiered in 2007 at the [[Barrow Street Theatre]] in New York City. It is composed of extensive interviews by the company, all focused on the idea of loss, in many of its myriad forms. According to ''The New York Times'' review of the production, "Underneath its wry surface lies a mournful acknowledgment of the transience of life<U+2019>s pleasures, symbolized here by any number of cherished possessions that somehow fell into a black hole, leaving behind an aching void in the shape of a bit of jewelry, a [[PalmPilot]] or a stuffed animal. . . . Even the most mundane and functional items can be a source of strange comfort, a talisman of achievement, a thing to cling to when life gets you down,"<ref>Isherwood, Charles. [http://www.thecivilians.org/news_070627_nytimes.html <U+201C>Checking the Lost and Found of Life,<U+201D> ''The New York Times'' (June 27, 2007).]</ref> ''Gone Missing'' was written and directed by Steve Cosson based on interviews conducted by the company, with music and lyrics written by [[Michael Friedman (composer)|Michael Friedman]], and additional text from "Interview with Dr. Palinurus" by Peter Morris.<ref>Cosson, Steven.

''Shadow of Himself'' was written in 2008 by playwright Neal Bell. He wrote the play by commission from The Civilians, with the support of [[The Public Theater]] and The Orchard Project, collaborating with the actors and taking inspiration from interviews done by the company.<ref>Bell, Neal.

=== This Beautiful City (2008) ===

{{main|This Beautiful City (play)}}
''This Beautiful City'' The Civilians<U+2019> first premiered the Actors Theatre of Louisville Humana Festival of New American Plays in March 2008, followed by runs at Studio Theatre in Washington, D.C. and Center Theatre Group in Los Angeles, California, and a New York premiere at the Vineyard Theatre in winter 2009. The piece engaged with "the expansion of the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] movement in [[Colorado Springs]]"<ref name="TBC" /> as well as the growing gulf between the secular and Evangelical communities. In addition to illustrating the daily interactions between the members of the community of Colorado Springs, the play also brings to the stage the fall of [[New Life Church (Colorado Springs, Colorado)|New Life Church]] founder [[Ted Haggard]], the scandal about whom broke while the Civilians were in Colorado Springs already actively researching for the play.<ref name="Soloski" /> The piece received nominations for [[Drama Desk Award|Drama Desk]]<ref name="desk" />, [[Drama League Award|Drama League]]<ref name="league" />, and  [[Lucille Lortel Awards]].<ref name="lortel" /> ''This Beautiful City'' was written by Steve Cosson and Jim Lewis from interviews conducted by Associate Artists [[Emily Ackerman]], [[Marsha Stephanie Blake]], [[Brad Heberlee]], [[Brandon Miller (actor)|Brandon Miller]], [[Stephen Plunkett]], and [[Alison Weller]], with music and lyrics by [[Michael Friedman (composer)|Michael Friedman]], and directed by Steve Cosson.<ref name="TBC">[http://www.vineyardtheatre.org/show-this-beautiful-city.htm ''This Beautiful City'' at the Vineyard Theatre website.]</ref>

=== Brooklyn at Eye Level (2008) ===

''Brooklyn at Eye Level'' was the first phase of a creative investigation into the heart of neighborhood, community change, and development. The project was conceived in light of the [[Atlantic Yards]] Development Project and the quickly changing landscape of [[Brooklyn]] as a unique performance of theater, dance, and music created from interviews with the real life players in the story of Brooklyn.<ref>Aronson, Isaac-Davy and Alison Lichter. [http://www.wnyc.org/news/articles/117645 "Brooklyn Neighborhood Acts Out On Development Plan."]</ref>

''Brooklyn at Eye Level'' was produced by The Civilians in December 2008 at the Brooklyn Lyceum. It was directed by Steven Cosson.<ref>http://www.bam.org/view.aspx?pid=825</ref> It is the first phase of a larger exploration of urban development in Brooklyn.

=== You Better Sit Down: Tales from my Parents' Divorce (2009) ===

Crafted from interviews between the cast and their own parents, ''YOU BETTER SIT DOWN'' is a heartbreaking and hilarious account of the parents' marriages and their subsequent divorces. It was directed and co-written by Anne Kauffman, with additional writing credit for Janice Paran
and David Barlow as well as the actor/writers Matthew Maher, Caitlin Miller, Jennifer R. Morris, and Robbie Collier Sublett.

The show was first performed at [[Galapagos Art Space]] in December 2009<ref>Flavorpill Events - [http://flavorpill.com/newyork/events/2009/11/13/the-civilians-present-you-better-sit-down-tales-from-my-parents-divorce  The Civilians present You Better Sit Down: Tales from My Parents' Divorce]</ref>. The performances were filmed by Park Pictures, and the footage has been released in short clips with interactive content through The Civilians' partnership with [[WNYC]].<ref>WNYC presents  [http://culture.wnyc.org/people/civilians/ This Weeks Divorce Tales] by The Civilians</ref>

The evening explores each couple's first meeting, the ups and downs of their marriage, their split, and the surprising perspectives on life after divorce. In these alternately funny, devastating and revelatory performances, the four actors are the conduits of their parents' stories and, inevitably though sometimes inadvertently, also of their own experiences of family division. This provocative show reveals the stories behind the statistics of one of the most prominent social phenomena of our time.

=== In The Footprint (2010) ===
 
''In The Footprint'', a play with music, is the culmination of the investigative work begun for ''Brooklyn at Eye Level''. It was directed by Steve Cosson, with a book by Cosson and Jocelyn Clarke and music & lyrics by Michael Friedman. It premiered at the [[Irondale Center]] in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, in November 2010, to critical acclaim<ref name="itf press">[http://thecivilians.org/current/in_the_footprint.html#5 Press for In The Footprint] at TheCivilians.org</ref>. It had its Boston premiere in January 2011 at [[Emerson College]]'s Paramount Center<ref>''Boston Globe'', [http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2011/01/22/in_footprint_its_big_business_vs_the_people/ In <U+2018>Footprint,<U+2019> it<U+2019>s big business vs. the people], January 22, 2011</ref>. 

Civilians artists gathered material about the controversial [[Atlantic Yards]] development project for several years, interviewing [[Jonathan Lethem|residents]] both old and new, [[Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn|community activists]], [[Forest City Ratner|developers]], [[Marty Markowitz|politicians]], and others<ref>''New York Times'', [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/08/theater/08doc.html When News Events Are Retold Onstage], December 7, 2010</ref>. By using the actual words of the players involved, ''In The Footprint'' aims to show all sides of this multifaceted issue and tries to examine how the conflicts erupted, where the process went wrong, what is at the heart of Brooklyn communities, and what can be learned from all parties in these debates. 

'''In The Footprint''' appeared on several best of 2010 lists<ref name="itf press" />, including those of [[The New Yorker]]<ref name="newyorker">Lyon, Shauna.

=== The Great Immensity ===

''The Great Immensity'' is a new play with music that tackles the monumental topic of the environment and the future of our planet. The play explores the themes of climate change, deforestation and extinction in two distinct locations: [[Barro Colorado Island]] (BCI) in the [[Panama Canal]] and the city of [[Churchill, Manitoba|Churchill]] in arctic Canada. Drawing on interviews with myriad individuals such as botanists, paleontologists, climatologists, indigenous community leaders, Polar Bear Tour guides and trappers, ''The Great Immensity'' gives voice to real people whose stories make the reality of present crisis tangible and viscerally felt, inspiring us all to make the profound changes this moment demands.

''The Great Immensity'' had two work-in-progress showings at the Berlind Theatre as part of The Civilians' cross-departmental residency at [[Princeton University]] with the [[Princeton Environmental Institute]] and the Princeton Atelier at the University's [[Lewis Center for the Arts]] on April 17, 2010.<ref>Peters, Carol.

=== Pretty Filthy ===

The Civilians is taking a long, hard look at the adult entertainment industry to create the first major musical about [[porn]]. Our artists are out in Vegas and the Cali valley talking to directors, performers, and producers about the ins and outs of the dirty movie biz: how they do it and what it takes to make it. The Civilians are getting to the bottom of how people got into the industry, how stars rose to fame, and how technological advancements have affected the sustainability and commercial viability of the genre.

''Pretty Filthy'' is in development through a commission from the [[Center Theatre Group]] in [[Los Angeles]]. [[Bess Wohl]] is writing the book, [[Michael Friedman (composer)|Michael Friedman]] is writing the music and lyrics, and Steven Cosson is directing. Some of the interview material has been performed in cabarets at [[Joe's Pub]] in New York<ref>[http://cabaret.broadwayworld.com/article/The_Civilians_explore_the_Porn_Industry_in_a_Cabaret_at_Joes_Pub_64_20100526 Broadwayworld.com] - The Civilians explore the Porn Industry in a Cabaret at Joe's Pub</ref><ref>[http://asset2.flavorpill.com/newyork/events/2011/3/4/the-civilians-let-me-ascertain-you Flavorpill.com] - The Civilians: Let Me Ascertain You</ref> and the [[Kirk Douglas Theatre]] in Los Angeles<ref>[http://www.theatermania.com/los-angeles/news/02-2011/photo-flash-mia-barron-emily-swallow-sam-trammell_33990.html Theatermania.com] - PHOTO FLASH: Mia Barron, Emily Swallow, Sam Trammell, Steven Weber, et al. at A Pretty Filthy Evening</ref>.
