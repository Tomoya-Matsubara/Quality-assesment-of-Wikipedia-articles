'''Health care''', or '''healthcare''', is the prevention, treatment, and management of illness and the preservation of mental and physical well being through the services offered by the [[Medicine|medical]], [[nursing]], and [[allied health]] professions. According to the [[World Health Organization]], health care embraces all the goods and services designed to promote health, including <U+201C>preventive, curative and palliative interventions, whether directed to individuals or to populations<U+201D>.<ref>{{cite book | author=World Heath Organization Report. | title=Why do health systems matter? | publisher=WHO| year=2000}} </ref> The organised provision of such services may constitute a [[health care system]]. This can include a specific governmental organisation such as, in the UK, the [[National Health Service]] or a cooperation across the National Health Service and Social Services as in [[Shared Care]]. Before the term "health care" became popular, English-speakers referred to ''[[medicine]]'' or to the ''[[health]] sector'' and spoke of the treatment and prevention of [[illness]] and [[disease]].

In most developed countries and many developing countries health care is provided to everyone regardless of their ability to pay. The [[National Health Service]] in the [[United Kingdom]] was the world's first [[universal health care]] system provided by government. It was established in 1948 by [[Clement Atlee]]'s [[Labour party (UK)|Labour]] government. Alternatively, compulsory government funded health insurance with nominal fees can be provided, as with Italy, which, according to the [[World Health Organisation]], has the second-best health system in the world.<ref>[http://www.internationalliving.com/italy/healthcare.html Health Care in Italy]</ref> Other examples are [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] in Australia, established in the 1970s by the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government, and by the same name [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]] in Canada, established between 1966 and 1984. Universal health care contrasts to the systems like [[health care in the United States]] or [[South Africa]], though South Africa is one of the many countries attempting [[health care reform]].<ref name="Physicians 1">Physicians for a National Health Program[http://www.pnhp.org/facts/international_health_systems.php?page=all "International Health Systems".]</ref>

==Industry==
{{main|Health care industry}}
The [[health care]] industry is considered an [[industry]] or [[profession]] which includes peoples exercise of [[skill]] or judgment or the providing of a service related to the [[preservation]] or improvement of the [[health]] of individuals or the treatment or care of individuals who are injured, sick, disabled, or infirm. The delivery of modern health care depends on an expanding group of trained [[professional]]s coming together as an [[interdisciplinary team]].<ref name=PrincetonDef>Princeton University. (2007).

The health care industry is one of the world's largest and fastest-growing industries.<ref>[http://www.kff.org/insurance/snapshot/chcm050206oth2.cfm From the Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation]</ref> Consuming over 10 percent of [[gross domestic product]] of most developed nations, health care can form an enormous part of a country's [[Economic system|economy]]. In [[2003]], health care costs paid to [[hospital]]s, [[physician]]s, [[nursing home]]s, [[diagnostic]] laboratories, [[pharmacy|pharmacies]], [[medical device]] manufacturers and other components of the health care system, consumed 15.3 percent<ref>[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/statistics/nhe/historical/highlights.asp From Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services]</ref> of the [[GDP]] of the [[United States]], the largest of any country in the world. For the United States, the health share of gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to hold steady in 2006 before resuming its historical upward trend, reaching 19.6 percent of GDP by 2016.<ref>[http://www.nainil.com/research/presentations/Introduction_to_Health_Care_in_USA.pdf "The Not So Short Introduction to Health Care in US"], by Nainil C.

==Systems==
{{Main|Health care systems}}
{{See also|Medical model|Preventive medicine|Social medicine}}
Purely ''private enterprise'' health care systems are comparatively rare. Where they exist, it is usually for a comparatively well-off subpopulation in a poorer country with a poorer standard of health care&ndash;for instance, private clinics for a small, wealthy expatriate population in an otherwise poor country. But there are countries with a majority-private health care system with residual public service (see [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]]). The other major models are public insurance systems. A [[Social security]] health care model is where workers and their families are insured by the State. A [[Publicly funded health care]] model is where the [[Residency (domicile)|residents]] of the country are insured by the State. Within this branch is [[Single-payer health care]], which describes a type of financing system in which a single entity, typically a government run organisation, acts as the administrator (or "payer") to collect all health care fees, and pay out all health care costs.<ref name="PNHP">Physicians for a National Health Program. [http://www.pnhp.org/facts/what_is_single_payer.php "What is Single Payer?".]</ref> Some advocates of universal health care assert that single-payer systems save money that could be used directly towards health care by reducing administrative waste.<ref name="PNHP"/> In practice this means that the government collects taxes from the public, businesses, etc., creates an entity to administer the supply of health care and then pays health care professionals. Harry Wachtel estimate a single payer universal healthcare system will actually save money through reduced bureaucratic administration costs.<ref>Massachusetts Nursing Association. [http://www.massnurses.org/single_payer/singlepay.htm "Single Payer Health Care: A Nurses Guide to Single Payer Reform."]</ref> [[Social health insurance]] is where the whole population or most of the population is a member of a sickness insurance company. Most health services are provided by private enterprises which act as contractors, billing the government for patient care.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/healthcare/public_vs_private.html CBC Health Care Private verses Public]</ref> In almost every country with a government health care system a parallel private system is allowed to operate. This is sometimes referred to as [[two-tier health care]]. The scale, extent, and funding of these private systems is very variable.

A traditional view is that improvements in health result from advancements in [[medical]] science. The [[medical model]] of health focuses on the eradication of [[illness]] through [[diagnosis]] and effective treatment. In contrast, the social model of health places emphasis on changes that can be made in society and in people's own lifestyles to make the population healthier. It defines ''illness'' from the point of view of the individual's functioning within their society rather than by monitoring for changes in [[biological]] or [[physiological]] signs.<ref>{{cite book | author=Bond J. & Bond S. | title=Sociology and Healthcare| publisher=Churchill Livingstone| year=1994 | id=ISBN 0-443-04059-1}}</ref>

==World Health Organization==
{{main|World Health Organization}}
{{seealso|Global health}}
[[Image:Flag of WHO.svg|right|thumb|The Flag of the World Health Organization]]
The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialised [[United Nations]] agency which acts as a coordinator and researcher for [[public health]] around the world. Established on [[7 April]] [[1948]], and headquartered in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], the agency inherited the mandate and resources of its predecessor, the Health Organization, which had been an agency of the [[League of Nations]]. The WHO's constitution states that its mission "is the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health." Its major task is to combat disease, especially key infectious diseases, and to promote the general health of the peoples of the world. Examples of its work include years of fighting [[smallpox]]. In 1979 the WHO declared that the disease had been eradicated - the first disease in history to be completely eliminated by deliberate human design. The WHO is nearing success in developing vaccines against [[malaria]] and [[schistosomiasis]] and aims to eradicate [[polio]] within the next few years. The organization has already endorsed the world's first official HIV/AIDS Toolkit for [[Zimbabwe]] from [[October 3]] [[2006]], making it an international standard.<ref>http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-10/04/content_5167991.htm</ref>

The WHO is financed by contributions from member states and from donors. In recent years the WHO's work has involved more collaboration, currently around 80 such partnerships, with [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s and the [[pharmaceutical industry]], as well as with foundations such as the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. Voluntary contributions to the WHO from national and local governments, foundations and NGOs, other UN organizations, and the private sector (including pharmaceutical companies), now exceed that of assessed contributions (dues) from its 193 member nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ftp.who.int/gb/pdf_files/EB105/ee17a1.pdf|title=Implementation of budget resolutions|publisher=World Health Organization|date=[[1999-12-16]]|accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref>

===[[Oceania]]===
Australia and [[New Zealand Ministry of Health|New Zealand]] both have publicly funded health care systems, though under the Conservative government in Australia, there has been new funding and incentives for people who pay for private health insurance. 

;[[Australia]]
{{main|Medicare (Australia)}}
Medicare was introduced by the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] Labor Government on [[1 July]] [[1975]] through the Health Insurance Act 1973. The [[Australian Senate]] rejected the changes multiple times and they were passed only after a joint sitting after the [[1974]] [[Australian electoral system#Double dissolutions|double dissolution]] election. Yet Medicare has been supported by subsequent governments and became a key feature of Australia<U+2019>s public policy landscape. The exact structure of Medicare, in terms of the size of the rebate to doctors and hospitals and the way it has administered, has varied over the years. The original Medicare program proposed a 1.35% levy (with low income exemptions) but these bills were rejected by the Senate, and so Medicare was originally funded from general taxation. In October 1976, the Fraser Government introduced a 2.5% levy. The program is now nominally funded by an income tax surcharge known as the ''Medicare levy'', which is currently set at 1.5% with exemptions for low income earners. In practice the levy raises only a fraction of the money required to pay for the scheme. If the levy was to fully pay for the services provided under the medicare banner then it would need to be set at about 8%. There is an additional levy of 1.0%, known as the Medicare Levy Surcharge, for those on high annual incomes ($50,000) who do not have adequate levels of private hospital coverage. This is part of an effort by the current [[Liberal Party of Australia|Coalition]] Federal Government to encourage people towards private health insurance.

===[[Europe]]===
{{seealso|Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Protection (European Commission)}}
All of Europe has publicly sponsored and regulated health care.

;[[Ireland]]
{{main|Health care in the Republic of Ireland}}
Health care in the Republic of Ireland is governed by the Health Act 2004, which established a new body to govern the national health service in the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[Health Service Executive]]. The new health service came into being officially on [[1 January]], [[2005]]; however the new structures are in the process of being established. Currently the HSE is continuing to manage the health service under the [[The Eleven Kingdoms|Health Act 1970 structures]]. The Health Boards no longer exist as corporate entities, however the structures which existed remain as divisions of the HSE until a plan of reorganisation is complete. Each former health board area operates as a division of the HSE and the former [[chief executive officer]] of each health board is now known as a chief officer for the HSE region.

;[[Slovenia]]
{{main|Health care in Slovenia}}
[[Image:ZZdravstvena.jpg|thumb|right|Slovene Health Insurance Card.]]
The Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia (the Institute) was founded on [[March 1]], [[1992]], according to the Law on health care and health insurance, after declaring independence from [[Yugoslavia]]. The Institute conducts its business as a public institute, bound by statute to provide compulsory health insurance. In the field of compulsory health insurance, the Institute's principal task is to provide effective collection (mobilisation) and distribution (allocation) of public funds, in order to ensure the insured persons quality rights arising from the said funds. The rights arising from compulsory health insurance, furnished by the funds collected by means of compulsory insurance contributions, comprise the rights to health care services and rights to several financial benefits (sick leave pay, reimbursement of travel costs and funeral costs, and insurance money paid in case of death).
The Institute comprises 10 regional units and 45 branch offices distributed around the territory of [[Slovenia]]. The functional unit the Information Centre and the Directorate complete the Institute structure. At the end of 2005, the Institute staff numbered regular 929 employees.
The Institute is governed by an Assembly, whose members are the (elected) representatives of employers (including the representatives of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia) and employees. The executive body of the Assembly is the Institute Board of Directors.
The Slovene health insurance card system was introduced, at the national scale, in the year 1999. The system provided the insured persons with a smart card and set up data links between the health care service providers and health insurance providers (the Health Insurance Institute and the two voluntary health insurance providers).

;[[Switzerland]]
{{main|Healthcare in Switzerland}}
Healthcare in Switzerland is regulated by the Federal Health Insurance Act. [[Health insurance]] is compulsory for all persons resident in [[Switzerland]] (within three months of taking up residence or being born in the country). International [[civil servant]]s, members of [[permanent mission]]s and their familiy members are exempted from compulsory health insurance. They can, however, apply to join the Swiss health insurance system, within six months of taking up residence in the country. Health insurance covers the costs of medical treatment and hospitalisation of the insured. However, the insured person pays part of the cost of treatment. This is done (a) by means of an annual [[excess]] (or [[deductible]], called the ''franchise''), which ranges from [[Swiss Franc|CHF]] 300 to a maximum of CHF 2,500 as chosen by the insured person (premiums are adjusted accordingly) and (b) by a charge of 10% of the costs over and above the excess.

{{main|National Health Service}}
[[Image:NHS.svg|thumb|right|The logo of the NHS in England. The colour, "NHS Blue" ([[Pantone]] 300), is used on signs and leaflets throughout the English NHS.]]
The NHS is the world's largest, centralised health service, and the world's third largest employer after the Chinese army and the Indian railways. It was created in the aftermath of [[World War II]], by [[Clement Attlee]]'s [[The Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government, based on the proposals of the [[William Beveridge|Beveridge]] Report, prepared in 1942.<ref>http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWbeveridgereport.htm</ref> The structure of the NHS in England and Wales was established by the National Health Service Act 1946 (1946 Act). The current Labour government has invested billions of new money in the NHS. However, [[Tony Blair]]'s policy, whilst leaving services free at point of use, was to encourage outsourcing of medical services and support to the private sector. Under the [[Private Finance Initiative]], an increasing number of hospitals have been built (or rebuilt) by private sector consortia; hospitals may have both medical services (such as "[[independent Sector Treatment Centre|surgicentres]]"),<ref>{{cite web | title = New generation surgery-centres to carry out thousands more NHS operations every year | publisher = [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] | date = 2002-12-03 | url = http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/PressReleases/PressReleasesNotices/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4026000&chk=0NNhMe | accessdate = 2006-09-15}}</ref> and non-medical services (such as catering) provided under long-term contracts by the private sector. These are more expensive than if the new build was simply funded from the public purse. A study by a consultancy company which works for the Department of Health shows that every <U+00A3>200 million spent on privately financed hospitals will result in the loss of 1000 doctors and nurses. The first PFI hospitals contain some 28 per cent fewer beds than the ones they replaced.<ref>{{cite web | author=[[George Monbiot]] | title=Private Affluence, Public Rip-Off | date=2002-03-10 | url=http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2002/03/10/private-affluence-public-rip-off/ | accessdate = 2006-09-07 | publisher = [[The Spectator]]}}</ref> Even so there is for the first time complete political consensus on the importance of free public health care.

===[[Latin America]]===
Most countries in Latin America have public health care provided. Mexico is planning to launch its own [[universal health care]] network<ref>G20 Health Care: "Health Care Systems and Health Market Reform in the G20 Countries." Prepared for the World Economic Forum by Ernst & Young. January 3, 2006.</ref>  though at the moment the standards of [[health care in Mexico]] are seriously lacking with large divides between rich and poor. Puerto Rico is planning its own [[Puerto Rico Health Reform|health reform]] for the poorest of the population. [[Health care in Venezuela]] is probably the most extensive and given the country's fortunes in oil wealth, expenditure has recently increased greatly, starting with mass vaccinations under the [[Plan Bolivar 2000]].

The federal government of [[Lester B. Pearson]], pressured by the [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP) who held the balance of power, introduced the Medical Care Act in 1966 that extended the HIDS Act cost-sharing to allow each province to establish a [[universal health care]] plan. It also set up the [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]] system. In [[1984]], the [[Canada Health Act]] was passed, which prohibited [[user fee]]s and extra billing by doctors. In 1999, the prime minister and most premiers reaffirmed in the [[Social Union Framework Agreement]] that they are committed to health care that has "comprehensiveness, universality, portability, public administration and accessibility."<ref>Government of Canada, Social Union, News Release, "[http://socialunion.gc.ca/news/020499_e.html A Framework to Improve the Social Union for Canadians: An Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Governments of the Provinces and Territories, February 4, 1999]," URL accessed 20 December 2006.</ref> The Canadian system is for the most part publicly funded, yet most of the services are provided by private enterprises, private corporations. Most all doctors do not receive an annual salary, but receive a fee per visit or service. About 30% of Canadians' health care is paid for through the private sector. This mostly goes towards services not covered or only partially covered by [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]] such as [[prescription drug]]s, [[dentistry]] and [[optometry]]. Many Canadians have private health insurance, often through their employers, that cover these expenses. In Canada, some services are permitted and some are not. The Supreme Court of Quebec ruled, in [[Chaoulli v. Quebec]], that private services must be allowed to compete with the public program,<ref>[http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2005/2005scc35/2005scc35.html From Montreal University]</ref> thus opening the door to a dual system of private and public healthcare.

{{main|Health care in Japan}}
In Japan, payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national [[health insurance]] program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance. Patients are free to select physicians or facilities of their choice. In the early 1990s, there were more than 1,000 [[mental hospital]]s, 8,700 general [[hospital]]s, and 1,000 comprehensive hospitals with a total capacity of 1.5 million beds. Hospitals provided both out-patient and in-patient care. In addition, 79,000 [[clinic]]s offered primarily out-patient services, and there were 48,000 [[dentist|dental clinics]]. Most [[hospital]]s sell medicine directly to patients, but there are 36,000 [[pharmacy|pharmacies]] where patients could purchase synthetic or herbal medication.

National health expenditures rose from about 1 trillion [[Yen]] in 1965 to nearly 20 trillion Yen in 1989, or from slightly more than 5% to more than 6% of Japan's national income. In addition to cost-control problems, the system was troubled with excessive paperwork, long waits to see physicians, assembly-line care for out-patients (because few facilities made appointments), [[over medication]], and abuse of the system because of low [[Out-of-pocket expenses|out-of-pocket costs]] to patients.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} Another problem is an uneven distribution of health personnel, with cities favored over rural areas. {{Fact|date=August 2007}}

===[[Africa]]===
Health care in Africa is usually non existent or highly limited and under resourced. The outbreak and spread of [[HIV/AIDS in Africa]] has crippled many populations and sent life expectancies plummeting. However, some countries have been able to tackle the challenges, for instance [[health care in Uganda]] as well as education has reduced HIV/AIDS infections from 13% to 4.1% from 1990 to 2003. This contrasts to some governments' approach, especially that of the [[South African Health Ministry]] who until recently denied the link between HIV/AIDS.

;[[Nigeria]]
{{main|Health care in Nigeria}}
Health care provision in Nigeria is a [[concurrent]] responsibility of the three [[tiers]] of [[government]] in the country.<ref>Rais Akhtar; Health Care Patterns and Planning in Developing Countries, Greenwood Press, 1991. pp 264</ref> However, because [[Nigeria]] operates a [[mixed economy]], private providers of health care have a visible role to play in health care delivery. The [[federal government]]'s role is mostly limited to coordinating the affairs of the [[university]] [[teaching hospital]]s, while the state government manages the various [[general hospital]]s and the [[local government]] focus on [[dispensaries]]. The total expenditure on health care as % of GDP is 4.6, while the percentage of federal government expenditure on health care is about 1.5%.<ref>Ronald J. Vogel; Financing Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa Greenwood Press, 1993. pp 18</ref> A [[long run]] indicator of the ability of the country to provide [[food]] sustenance and avoid [[malnutrition]] is the rate of growth of per capita food production; from 1970-1990, the rate for Nigeria was 0.25%.<ref>Ronald J. Vogel; Financing Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa Greenwood Press, 1993. pp 1-18</ref> Though small, the positive rate of per capita may be due to Nigeria's [[importation]] of food products.

Historically, [[health insurance]] in Nigeria can be applied to a few instances: free health care provided and financed for all [[citizens]], health care provided by [[government]] through a special health insurance scheme for government employees and private firms entering contracts with private health care providers.<ref>Ronald J. Vogel; Financing Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa Greenwood Press, 1993. pp 101-102</ref> However, there are few people who fall within the three instances. In May 1999, the government created the [[National Health Insurance]] Scheme, the scheme encompasses [[government]] [[employees]], the organized [[private sector]] and the informal sector. [[Legislative]] wise, the scheme also covers children under five, permanently disabled persons and prison inmates. In 2004, the administration of Obasanjo further gave more legislative powers to the scheme with positive amendments to the original 1999 legislative act.<ref>Felicia Monye; 'An Appraisal of the National [[Health Insurance]] Scheme of [[Nigeria]]', Commonwealth Law Bulletin, 32:3 415-427</ref>

==Economics==
{{main|Health care economics}}
Medical (health) insurance is subject to the well-known economic problem of [[adverse selection]] which may also be referred to as a [[market failure]]. Adverse selection in insurance markets occurs because those providing insurance have limited information with which to estimate the risks their clients wish to insure against. In simple terms, those with poor health will apply for insurance, raising the cost of providing insurance; those with good health will find the cost of insurance too expensive, raising costs further. In practical terms, adverse selection means that private insurers are economically incentivized to spend substantial sums on 'weeding out' bad risks in advance by providing medical insurance only to the most healthy. Among the potential solutions posited by economists are forms of universal health insurance, such as requiring all citizens to purchase insurance, limiting the ability of insurance companies to deny insurance to individuals or vary price between individuals. Compulsory universal health insurance is a common thread, although there is no requirement that the insurance or medical services be provided by government.<ref>Michael Rothschild and Joseph Stiglitz, "Equilibrium in Competitive Insurance Markets: An Essay on the Economics of Imperfect Information," Quarterly Journal of Economics, November 1976 (90:629-649) (known as the Rothschild-Stiglitz Model)</ref><ref>Paulo Belli, [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2001/04/13/000094946_01040505331570/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf ''How Adverse Selection Affects the Health Insurance Market'']</ref>

Most European systems are financed through a mix of public and private contributions.<ref name="Bentes">Bentes M, Dias CM, Sakellarides C, Bankauskaite V. [http://www.euro.who.int/document/e82937.pdf#search=%22Portugal%2C%20health%20care%22 ''Health Care Systems in Transition: Portuagal.''] WHO are Regional Offices for Europe on behalf of the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, 2004.</ref> The majority of universal health care systems are funded primarily by [[tax revenue]] (''e.g.'' [[Portugal]]<ref name="Bentes"/>). Some nations, such as Germany, France<ref name="Physicians 1">Physicians for a National Health Program[http://www.pnhp.org/facts/international_health_systems.php?page=all "International Health Systems".]</ref> and Japan<ref name="Chua">Chua, Kao-Ping. [http://www.amsa.org/uhc/SinglePayer101.pdf "Single Payer 101".] February 10, 2006.</ref> employ a multi-payer system in which health care is funded by private and public contributions. In 2001 Canadians paid $2,163 per capita versus $4,887 U.S., according to the Los Angeles Times (also, see table above). According to Dr. Stephen Bezruchka, a senior lecturer in the School of Public Health at the University of Washington in Seattle, Canadians do better by every health care measure. According to a World Health Organization report published in 2003, life expectancy at birth in Canada is 79.8 years, versus 77.3 in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0223-01.htm|title=In Health, Canada Tops US; Our neighbors to the north live longer and pay less for care. The reasons why are being debated, but some cite the gap between rich and poor in the US|author=Foreman, Judy|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=[[2004-02-23]]|accessdate=2007-07-03}}</ref>

A distinction is also made between municipal and national healthcare funding. For example, one model is that the bulk of the healthcare is funded by the municipality, speciality healthcare is provided and possibly funded by a larger entity, such as a municipal co-operation board or the state, and the medications are paid by a state agency. No entirely private health care system exists, although the [[Massachusetts 2006 Health Reform Statute|reform bill]] in Massachusetts attempts to make private health care more affordable. 

Conservative Republican US Senator [[Bill Frist]] argued in the ''New England Journal of Medicine''{{Fact|date=February 2007}} that the free market will keep costs down, because individuals who have to pay for their own health care will make wiser decisions and not spend money on unneeded or inefficient care. A deregulated free market, Frist argues, will also encourage efficiency and innovation. The US currently (2007) has the most expensive health care of any [[OECD]] country and also has the highest percentage of costs paid privately.<ref>[http://www.who.int/whosis/database/core/core_select_process.cfm?strISO3_select=AUS,BELCMR,CAN,CZE,DNK,FIN,FRA,DEU,GRC,HUN,ISL,IRL,ITA,JPN,LUX,MEX,NLD,NZL,NOR,POL,PRT,KOR,SVK,ESP,SWE,CHE,TUR,GBR,USA&strIndicator_select=NumberOfPhysicians,DensityOfPhysicians,NumberOfNurses,DensityOfNurses,NumberOfMidwives,DensityOfMidwives,NumberOfDentists,DensityOfDentists,NumberOfPharmacists,DensityOfPharmacists,NumberOfEnvironmentalHealthWorkers,DensityOfEnvironmentalHealthWorkers,NumberOfCommunityHealthWorkers,DensityOfCommunityHealthWorkers,NumberOfLabWorkers,DensityOfLabWorkers,NumberOfOtherHealthWorkers,DensityOfOtherHealthWorkers,NumberOfHealthSupportWorkers,DensityOfHealthSupportWorkers,TotEOHPctOfGDP,GovEOHPctOfTotEOH,PrvEOHPctOfTotEOH,GovEOHPctOfTotGovExp,ExtResPctOfTotEOH,SocSecEOHPctOfGovEOH,OopEOHPctOfPrvEOH,PrepaidPctOfPrvEOH,PcTotEOHinUSD,PcTotEOHinIntD,PcGovEOHinUSD,PcGovEOHinIntD,VRCoverage,HospitalBeds&intYear_select=latest&fixed=indicator&language=english ''Core Health Indicators'']

==Politics==
{{main|Health care politics}}
The politics of health care depends largely on which country one is in. Current concerns in [[National Health Service|Britain]], for instance, revolve around the use of [[private finance initiative]]s to build hospitals or the excessive use of targets in cutting waiting lists. In Germany and France, concerns are more based on the rising cost of drugs to the governments. In [[HIV/AIDS in Brazil|Brazil]], an important political issue is the breach of [[intellectual property]] rights, or [[patent]]s, for the domestic manufacture of [[Antiretroviral drug]]s used in the treatment of [[HIV/AIDS]]. The [[HIV/AIDS in South Africa|South African]] government, whose population sets the record for HIV infections, came under pressure for its refusal to admit there is any connection with AIDS<ref> [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/826742.stm BBC News: Controversy dogs Aids forum]</ref> because of the cost it would have involved. In the United States, which has some of the most sophisticated, technologically advanced health care in the world, 12% to 16% of the citizens are still unable to afford complete health insurance.

Opponents of universal health care in the United States often argue that it will require higher taxes and a great likelihood of poorly performing health care facilities and physicians.<ref>http://www.jwpcivitasinstitute.org/newsroom/Magazine/Winter%2006%20Magazine.pdf; page 22.</ref> The absence of a market mechanism may slow innovation in treatment and research leading to rationing of care through waiting lists. A statistical comparison shows that it is not universal health care that leads to a doctor shortage, but the payment system to doctors that causes a doctors shortage. In Italy,<ref>[http://www.pnrec.org/2001papers/DaigneaultLajoie.pdf Comparisons of Health Systems - Docters per patients p.13]</ref> doctors are paid a fee per patient per year, a per capita salary, and Italy does not have a doctor shortage but has one of the highest doctor per patient ration, 5.8 doctors per 1,000 patients. In Italy though, it should be noted that most physicians subsequently have very limited hours; many only maintaining patient hours 2 days per week. Canada, whose universal health care system pays its doctors a "fee per visit", creates a real market condition, where doctors' salaries are protected, and even increased, by decreasing the supply of doctors. Canada has a low doctor per patient ration of 2.1 doctors per 1,000 patients. A comparative analysis shows that a salaried doctor system, while not perfect, results in more doctors; however, they work substantially fewer hours, while the fee per visit system creates economic pressures to reduce the number of doctors, who subsequently work more hours.

==Providers==
{{main|Health care provider}}
A health care provider or health [[professional]] is an [[organization]] or person who delivers proper health care in a systematic way professionally to any individual in need of health care services. A health care provider could be a [[government]], Health care industry, health care equipment, institution such as a [[hospital]] or [[medical laboratory]], [[physician]]s, support staff, [[nurse]]s, [[therapist]]s, [[psychologist]]s, [[veterinarian]]s, [[dentistry|dentists]], [[Optometry|optometrists]], [[pharmacist]]s, or even a [[health insurance]] company.
