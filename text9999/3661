==Background==
A [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship|Light Heavyweight Championship]] bout between the current champion [[Jon Jones (fighter)|Jon Jones]] and #1 contender [[Glover Teixeira]] was briefly linked as the event headliner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mmajunkie.com/news/2013/10/jon-jones-glover-teixeira-mir-overeem-top-ufc-169-on-super-bowl-weekend|title=Jon Jones-Glover Teixeira, Mir-Overeem top UFC 169 on Super Bowl weekend|publisher=MMAjunkie.com|author=Staff|accessdate=10-03-2013}}</ref> However, just days after the announcement, [[Dana White]] indicated that "the timing didn't work out" for the pairing and that fight would take place at a later event.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mmajunkie.com/news/2013/10/jon-jones-glover-teixeira-title-fight-no-longer-on-ufc-169-super-bowl-card|title=Jon Jones-Glover Teixeira title fight no longer on UFC 169 Super Bowl card|publisher=MMAjunkie.com|author=Matt Erickson and John Morgan|accessdate=10-07-13}}</ref> 

The event was expected to be headlined by the long awaited return of the [[List of UFC champions#Bantamweight Championship|Bantamweight Champion]] [[Dominick Cruz]]. However, on January 6, UFC President Dana White announced that Cruz had torn his groin in training and pulled from the fight. Cruz has also vacated his title, making Bar<U+00E3>o the undisputed bantamweight champion.  Stepping up to replace Cruz was [[Urijah Faber]], in a rematch of their interim title bout at [[UFC 149]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mma/story/_/id/10252465/dominick-cruz-ufc-169-groin-injury-vacates-title|title=Dominick Cruz withdraws from fight|author=Staff|accessdate=2014-01-06}}</ref>
