'''"That Is All"''' is a song by English musician [[George Harrison]] released as the final track of his 1973 album ''[[Living in the Material World]]''. A slow, heavily orchestrated ballad, it is one of many Harrison love songs that appear to be directed at either a woman or a deity. Harrison wrote and recorded the song during the height of his public devotion to [[Hinduism]]; on release, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described its lyrics as "a sort of Hindu ''[[In paradisum|In Paradisium]]''".<ref name="Holden/RS" />

Recording for "That Is All" took place in London in late 1972, following a period when Harrison's attention had been centred on completing the international aid project begun the previous year with [[the Concert for Bangladesh]]. The other musicians on the track include keyboard players [[Gary Wright]], whose fledgling solo career Harrison actively supported during the early 1970s, and [[Nicky Hopkins]]. The song's orchestral and choral arrangements were provided by [[John Barham]], who had also worked on Harrison's album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' and Wright's ''[[Footprint (album)|Footprint]]''. "That Is All" has been covered by singers [[Andy Williams]] and [[Harry Nilsson]].

==Background==
As with all the songs on his 1973 album ''[[Living in the Material World]]'' except for "[[Try Some, Buy Some]]",<ref>Huntley, pp. 49<U+2013>50, 64.</ref> [[George Harrison]] wrote "That Is All" over 1971<U+2013>72,<ref name="Madinger & Easter p 439" /> a period marked by both his heightened devotion to [[Hinduism|Hindu]] spirituality<ref>Huntley, pp. 87<U+2013>89.</ref><ref>Leng, p. 124.</ref> and his commitment to providing humanitarian aid for the refugees of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].<ref>Lavezzoli, pp. 193<U+2013>94.</ref><ref>Doggett, p. 192.</ref> With his own career taking second place to the latter endeavour, following [[the Concert for Bangladesh]] in August 1971,<ref>Clayson, pp. 308, 314<U+2013>17, 318.</ref> Harrison continued to assist American musician [[Gary Wright]] in establishing himself as a solo artist,<ref>Rodriguez, pp. 87<U+2013>88, 319<U+2013>20, 321.</ref><ref>Wright, pp. 97<U+2013>99.</ref> when [[A&M Records]] released Wright's album ''[[Footprint (album)|Footprint]]'' in November that year.<ref>James Chrispell, [http://www.allmusic.com/album/footprint-mw0000954379 "Gary Wright ''Footprint''"], [[AllMusic]] (retrieved 23 July 2012).</ref><ref>Shawn Perry, [http://vintagerock.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=32:gary-wright&catid=3:interviews&Itemid=4 "The Gary Wright Interview"], vintagerock.com (retrieved 11 March 2015).</ref> One of the album's tracks was "Love to Survive", which was orchestrated by Harrison's ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' arranger, [[John Barham]].<ref>Wright, pp. 98<U+2013>99.</ref> According to Barham, "musically there was a strong rapport" between himself, Harrison and Wright at this time, while author Simon Leng cites "Love to Survive" as a song that influenced Harrison's composition "That Is All".<ref>Leng, pp. 108, 135.</ref>

In his autobiography, ''[[I, Me, Mine (book)|I, Me, Mine]]'', Harrison comments only briefly on "That Is All", saying: "The melody came to me and I then had to think of lyrics. That's all."<ref name="IMM p 264">Harrison, p. 264.</ref> Commentators have remarked on the fact that, like many other Harrison compositions <U+2013> "[[Long, Long, Long]]", "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]", "[[What Is Life]]",<ref>Richie Unterberger, [http://www.allmusic.com/song/what-is-life-t743156 "George Harrison 'What Is Life'"], [[AllMusic]] (retrieved 27 July 2012).</ref> "[[Don't Let Me Wait Too Long]]", "[[Learning How to Love You]]" and "[[Your Love Is Forever]]" among them<ref>Huntley, pp. 167<U+2013>68.</ref><ref name="Schaffner p 115">Schaffner, p. 115.</ref> <U+2013> it serves as both a conventional love song to a woman and a declaration of devotion to God.<ref name="Spizer p 256" /><ref>Leng, pp. 207<U+2013>08.</ref> Harrison said in a 1976 interview: "I think all love is part of a universal love. When you love a woman, it's the God in her that you see."<ref>The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', p. 132.</ref>

==Composition==
The song is in the [[Key (music)|musical key]] of A.<ref>"That Is All", in ''George Harrison ''Living in the Material World'' (sheet music for Piano, Vocal & Guitar)'', Music Sales Limited (London, 1973).</ref> Leng identifies the composition as a development of Harrison's favoured "Something" ballad style.<ref name="Leng p 135">Leng, p. 135.</ref> A number of "characteristic" Harrison musical devices are found in "That Is All", Leng continues <U+2013> such as a melody that rises by a [[Semitone|half step]] with each line, and an [[A minor]] chord sharpened to an [[augmented triad]] "to create drama".<ref>Leng, pp. 135<U+2013>36.</ref>

Author Ian Inglis describes the song's melody as "romantic". Referring to its status as the last track on ''Living in the Material World'', he also comments on the appropriateness of Harrison's opening words:<ref name="Inglis p 43">Inglis, p. 43.</ref> "''That is all I want to say''".<ref name="IMM p 266">Harrison, p. 266.</ref> Inglis writes that Harrison goes on to state both "[what] he wants to do for his lover" and "what he hopes for in return",<ref name="Inglis p 43" /> in the respective lines "''To try to love you more''" and "''A smile when I feel blue''".<ref name="IMM p 266" />

Leng considers that the song's [[Thirty-two-bar form#Middle eight|middle eight]] echoes the same "tongue-tied difficulty" that Harrison had first introduced in his 1966 composition "[[I Want to Tell You]]":<ref name="Leng p 136">Leng, p. 136.</ref>

{{quote|''Times I find it hard to say <br> With useless words getting in my way <br> Silence often says much more <br> Than trying to say what's been said before&nbsp;...''}}

During this section, the change from a regular 4/4 [[time signature]] to 3/8 provides, in Leng's words, a "stuttering, hesitant syntax" that reflects the message of the lyrics.<ref name="Leng p 136" /> On release, the same lyrics were identified by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reviewer [[Stephen Holden]] as "a sort of Hindu ''[[In paradisum|In Paradisium]]''".<ref name="Holden/RS">Stephen Holden, [http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/living-in-the-material-world-19730719 "George Harrison, ''Living in the Material World''"], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 19 July 1973 (retrieved 24 July 2012).</ref>

==Recording==
The recording sessions for ''Living in the Material World'' began in October 1972<ref name="Madinger & Easter p 439">Madinger & Easter, p. 439.</ref> after Harrison had spent part of the summer staying with Wright in Portugal.<ref>Badman, pp. 79, 83.</ref><ref>Huntley, pp. 85, 87.</ref> Although Harrison had intended to co-produce the album with [[Phil Spector]] as before, he decided to work without him,<ref name="Spizer p 254">Spizer, p. 254.</ref> partly as a result of Spector's erratic behaviour at the start of the sessions.<ref>Timothy White, "George Harrison <U+2013> Reconsidered", ''[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]'', November 1987, p. 53.</ref><ref>Huntley, pp. 88<U+2013>89.</ref> Harrison employed elements of Spector's signature production style,<ref>Schaffner, pp. 159<U+2013>60.</ref> but with a degree of subtlety in comparison to the big sound on ''All Things Must Pass''.<ref>Clayson, p. 323.</ref><ref name="John Metzger/MB">John Metzger, [http://www.musicbox-online.com/reviews-2006/georgeharrison-livinginthematerialworld.html#axzz20rOE4V00 "George Harrison ''Living in the Material World''"], ''The Music Box'', vol. 13 (11), November 2006 (retrieved 17 July 2012).</ref> In his 2014 autobiography, Wright says that Spector's dismissal was "the right move"; he describes ''Material World'' as his favourite Harrison album and "a beautiful masterpiece showing more of him <U+2013> without Phil Spector's production".<ref>Wright, p. 107.</ref> Aside from Harrison and Wright, the musicians on "That Is All" were [[Nicky Hopkins]] (on piano), [[Klaus Voormann]] (bass) and [[Jim Keltner]] (drums).<ref name="Leng p 135" />

As on "[[Who Can See It]]", another of the album's ballads, Harrison recorded "That Is All" using a [[Leslie speaker|Leslie]] rotary effect on his electric guitar.<ref name="Leng p 129">Leng, p. 129.</ref> This sound opens the song, after which the [[rhythm section]] joins in for an extended instrumental introduction that sees first Wright's electric piano and then Hopkins' piano interweave as second and third voices around Harrison's guitar <U+2013> an example of an album-wide production aesthetic that, in Robert Rodriguez's words, lets "instruments sparkle" and allows "breathing space".<ref name="Rodriguez p 156">Rodriguez, p. 156.</ref> Following the second verse, Wright's<ref name="Spizer p 256">Spizer, p. 256.</ref> [[overdubbing|overdubbed]], "[[Piggies]]"-style harpsichord appears along with [[John Barham]]'s strings and choir.<ref name="Leng p 135" /> The early calm musical surroundings are broken only in the middle eight, with the arrival of brass orchestration (Barham-arranged again), after which, during the song's third verse, the string section and "heavenly" choir return with added urgency, as if to "intensify the already fervid romanticism through expanded production", as Holden opined.<ref name="Holden/RS" />

Harrison overdubbed a brief, slide-guitar solo over part of the second middle-eight section, most probably in January or February 1973.<ref>Badman, p. 89.</ref> Barham's contributions were added in early March,<ref name="Spizer p 254" /> and those London sessions marked the last time that Harrison would work with the arranger during the 1970s. Their collaborations had taken in Harrison's ''[[Wonderwall Music]]'', ''All Things Must Pass'' and ''Living in the Material World'' albums, as well as [[Apple Records|Apple]] projects for [[Jackie Lomax]], [[Billy Preston]] and [[Radha Krsna Temple|Radha Krishna Temple (London)]].<ref>Leng, pp. 108, 281.</ref>

==Release and reception==
Apple Records issued ''Living in the Material World'' at the end of May 1973, or late June in Britain,<ref>Castleman & Podrazik, p. 125.</ref> with "That Is All" sequenced to follow "[[The Day the World Gets 'Round]]".<ref>Spizer, pp. 253, 256.</ref> Writing in ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Michael Watts described the album as "Harrison's personal statement" documenting his journey towards "a spiritual goal which for the first time he has been able to define".<ref name="Watts/MM">Michael Watts, "The New Harrison Album", ''[[Melody Maker]]'', 9 June 1973, p. 3.</ref> Watts continued: "now he stands as something more than an entertainer. Now he's being honest. When you've been through all the bullshit and come out the other side, that's the only thing you can be."<ref name="Watts/MM" /> In his review for ''Rolling Stone'', Stephen Holden referred to the album's "inspirationally, opulently, romantic" qualities and wrote of "That Is All" and the preceding "The Day the World Gets 'Round" as being "two devotional prayers whose solemn [[mantra]]-influenced melodies are barely able to sustain their lush orchestration. Yet they do, so that at the end we are left suspended in ethereality&nbsp;..."<ref name="Holden/RS" />

In his book ''The Beatles Solo on Apple Records'', [[Bruce Spizer]] describes "That Is All" as "a beautiful love song written either for a woman or the Lord".<ref name="Spizer p 256" /> Writing for [[Rough Guides]], author and critic Chris Ingham similarly considers that "the 'love' [Harrison is] so desperate to express" in the song "seems directed as much to an earthly relationship as to any God", and he cites this as an example of the "restraint and, in places, considerable grace and beauty" adopted by Harrison on the album.<ref>Ingham, p. 134.</ref> Among other Beatles biographers, Robert Rodriguez writes that the track "sums up the journey" in the same way as "[[Hear Me Lord]]" successfully concludes the song cycle on ''All Things Must Pass'',<ref name="Rodriguez p 156" /> a view shared by Elliot Huntley, who admires "That Is All" as a "lush orchestral prayer where George really does prostrate himself at His feet".<ref>Huntley, p. 94.</ref> Reviewing the 2014 ''[[The Apple Years 1968<U+2013>75|Apple Years]]'' reissue of ''Material World'', Joe Marchese of The Second Disc highlights "That Is All" among songs that combine to provide the album's "earnest and intensely personal, yet wholly accessible, statement".<ref name="Marchese/Review">Joe Marchese, [http://theseconddisc.com/2014/09/23/review-the-george-harrison-remasters-the-apple-years-1968-1975/ "Review: The George Harrison Remasters <U+2013> 'The Apple Years 1968<U+2013>1975'"], The Second Disc, 23 September 2014 (retrieved 3 October 2014).</ref>

==Cover versions==
Given the song's mood and sentiment, authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter consider "That Is All" to have been suitable for inclusion on a [[Frank Sinatra]] album.<ref>Madinger & Easter, p. 441.</ref> While Sinatra did not record it, the song was covered by singer [[Andy Williams]],<ref name="Ruhlmann/AM" /> who had been one of the many [[easy listening]] artists, along with Sinatra, to cover Harrison's "Something".<ref>Robert Fontenot, [http://oldies.about.com/od/thebeatlessongs/a/something_2.htm "Something: The history of this classic Beatles song" (page 2)], oldies.about.com (retrieved 11 March 2015).</ref> Featuring contributions from Hopkins, Voormann and Keltner,<ref>Album credits, ''Solitaire'' LP, 1973 ([[Columbia Records]] KC 32383; produced by Richard Perry).</ref> Williams' version of "That Is All" appeared on his 1973 album ''[[Solitaire (Andy Williams album)|Solitaire]]''.<ref name="Ruhlmann/AM">William Ruhlmann, [http://www.allmusic.com/album/solitaire-mw0000859706 "Andy Williams ''Solitaire''"], [[AllMusic]] (retrieved 11 March 2015).</ref> The recording was produced by [[Richard Perry]], with whom Harrison worked on [[Ringo Starr]]'s album ''[[Ringo (album)|Ringo]]'' in Los Angeles<ref>Badman, pp. 92, 95.</ref> shortly after completing ''Living in the Material World''.<ref>Leng, pp. 138<U+2013>39.</ref><ref>Madinger & Easter, p. 440.</ref>

[[Harry Nilsson]] recorded "That Is All" for his 1976 album ''[[...That's the Way It Is]]''.<ref>[http://dev3.secondhandsongs.com/performance/10886 "Cover version of That Is All by George Harrison"], Second Hand Songs (retrieved 11 March 2015).</ref> The song appears twice there, as the opening track and as a [[reprise]] to close the album.<ref>Rodriguez, p. 233.</ref>
