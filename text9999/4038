"'''Born to Make You Happy'''" is a song by the American recording artist [[Britney Spears]]. The song was written and produced by [[Kristian Lundin]] and co-written by [[Andreas Carlsson]] for Spears' debut studio album, ''[[...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999). The song was released on December 6, 1999 by [[Jive Records]], as the fourth single from the album. The [[teen pop]] song, speaks of a relationship that a woman desires to correct, not quite understanding what went wrong, as she comes to realize that she was "born to make [her lover] happy."

"Born to Make You Happy" received mixed reviews from music critics, with some calling it an early classic, but entirely an unremarkable song. It achieved commercial success, peaking inside the top-five in eleven countries. The lowest chart position for the single was in France, where it reached number nine. The song was certified Platinum by the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI) in [[Sweden]], for selling over 40,000 physical units of the single. It was also certified Gold by [[IFPI]] in [[IFPI|Germany]], Silver by the [[Syndicat National de l'<U+00C9>dition Phonographique]] (SNEP) in [[Syndicat National de l'<U+00C9>dition Phonographique|France]] and by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) in the [[British Phonographic Industry|United Kingdom]].

An accompanying music video, directed by [[Billie Woodruff]], portrays Spears dreaming that she is with her lover, while she sings and dances during the majority of the video. Spears performed the song on four tours, including [[...Baby One More Time Tour]], where Spears sang the song seated on a staircase, [[...Baby One More Time Tour|Crazy 2k Tour]], [[Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour]], wearing pajamas and slippers, and [[Dream Within a Dream Tour]], where Spears emerged from the middle of a giant musical box as a [[ballerina]] to perform the song in a medley with "[[Lucky (Britney Spears song)|Lucky]]" and "[[Sometimes (Britney Spears song)|Sometimes]]".

==Reception==
===Critical response===
"Born to Make You Happy" received mixed reviews from music critics. Kyle Anderson of [[MTV]] considered the song's chorus more than "a little bit off-putting," saying the first lines of it "could be a sentiment that a lovelorn 16-year-old can understand, but it also sounds like Spears is in training to be a [[geisha]]."<ref name=kylemtv/> Craig MacInnis of ''[[Hamilton Spectator]]'' said "["Born to Make You Happy"] verge on the sort of boy-worshipping dreck that even [[Tiffany (singer)|Tiffany]] would have sniffedat."<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://travel.canoe.ca/AllPop-SpearsBritney/cd_baby1.html|last=MacInnis|first=Craig|title=Bopper babe's CD glib collection of cliches|date=January 12, 1999||publisher=''[[Hamilton Spectator]]''.
