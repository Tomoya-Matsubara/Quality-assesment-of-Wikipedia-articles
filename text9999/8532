The '''GooGoo Cluster''' is an [[United States|American]] [[candy bar]] sold since 1912 in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. It was developed by [[Howell Campbell]] and the Standard Candy Company. The disk-shaped candy bar contains [[marshmallow]], [[caramel]] and roasted [[peanuts]] covered in milk [[chocolate]]. GooGoo Cluster is considered the first combination candy bar, meaning it contained several types of candy rather than an all-chocolate bar. The name is  thought to refer to the sound a baby makes; another theory is that the candy was sold at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] (GOO).

During the [[Great Depression]], Goo Goo Clusters were advertised as "a nourishing lunch for a nickel." This slogan was used until the 1950s.

Variations include '''GooGoo Supreme''' (pecans replace the peanuts) and '''Peanut Butter GooGoo''' (peanut butter replaces marshmallow).

GooGoo Clusters have appeared in the movies ''[[Nashville (film)]]'', ''[[The Nutty Professor]]'' and ''[[Charlie's War]]''.

GooGoo Clusters have also appeared throughout the PC video game "[[Redneck Rampage]]" and "[[Viva Pinata]]".
