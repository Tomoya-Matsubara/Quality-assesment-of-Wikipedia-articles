The 149th [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] took place on 6 April 2003. Held annually, the Boat Race is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along a {{convert|4.2|mi|km|adj=on}} tidal stretch of the [[River Thames]] in south-west London.  The lead changed twice during the course of the race, which Oxford won by one foot (30&nbsp;cm), the smallest margin of victory in the history of the event.  The close race has been described as "epic", while multiple Olympic gold-medallist [[Steve Redgrave]] suggested that the race was the "greatest we will see in our lifetimes".

Umpired by the Boat Race veteran [[Boris Rankov]], the 2003 race was the first to be scheduled on a Sunday.  As a result of a collision between the Cambridge boat and a [[Launch (boat)|launch]], a member of the Cambridge crew was replaced just two days before the race.  This was the first Boat Race to feature two sets of brothers on opposing sides.  In the reserve race [[Goldie (Cambridge University Boat Club)|Goldie]] beat Isis and Oxford won the [[Women's Boat Race|Women's race]].
