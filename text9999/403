The '''miniskirt''' (often hyphenated as '''mini-skirt''') is a [[skirt]] with a hemline well above the knees (generally 20 cm - about 8 inches - or more above knee level). The mini was the defining fashion symbol of "[[Swinging London]]" in the [[1960s]].

==Origin==
After [[World War I]], hemlines had risen rapidly and, by the mid-[[1920s]], dresses worn by young "[[flappers]]" were often above the knee. One by-product was the abandonment of the constraining [[corsetry]] of [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian]] times. The miniskirt's existence in the 1960s is generally credited to the [[fashion designer]] [[Mary Quant]], who was inspired by the [[Mini]] automobile, although the [[France|French]] designer [[Andr<U+00E9> Courr<U+00E8>ges]] is also often cited as its inventor (the French referred to it as ''la mini-jupe''), and there is disagreement as to who invented it first. Some give the credit to Helen Rose who made some miniskirts for actress [[Anne Francis]] in the [[1956]] science fiction movie, ''[[Forbidden Planet]]''. [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0741423/]

Recently, Marit Allen, a ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' "Young Ideas" editor at the time, has stated that "[[John Bates (designer)|John Bates]], in particular, has always been completely unappreciated for his contribution to the innovation and creativity he brought to the London design scene." He bared the midriff, used transparent vinyl and, Marit Allen asserts, was responsible for "the raising of the hemline. It was John Bates, rather than Mary Quant or Courr<U+00E8>ges, who was responsible for the miniskirt." Bates' costumes and accessories for [[Diana Rigg]], as [[Emma Peel]] in the ABC TV series, ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', from [[1965]]-[[1967|7]], helped to define "Mod style." [http://www.sugarzine.com/site_08.03/fashion.html]. As ''The Avengers''' filmed episodes were made several months before screening, Avengers producer Brian Clemens confirmed in interviews that the miniskirt designed by Bates had to be used as a "gamble", since they did not know if it would catch on in public or be seen as a fashion failure by the time the episodes aired.  However, Emma Peel's fashions were accepted by the public and even spawned a line of replicas of her clothes for public sale. Another, more "immediate" proponent of the miniskirt on television was [[Cathy McGowan]], who introduced the weekly rock music show, ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' ([[1964]]-[[1966|6]]).

==Mary Quant and Jean Shrimpton==
Mary Quant ran a popular [[Retailing#Shops and stores|clothes shop]] in the [[Kings Road]], [[Chelsea, London]] called ''Bazaar'', from which she sold her own designs. In the late [[1950s]] she began experimenting with shorter skirts, which resulted in the miniskirt in 1965&mdash;one of the defining [[fashion]]s of the decade. 

Owing to Quant's position in the heart of fashionable "[[Swinging London]]", the miniskirt was able to spread beyond a simple street fashion into a major international trend. Its acceptance was greatly boosted by [[Jean Shrimpton]]'s wearing a short white shift dress, made by Colin Rolfe, on 30 October 1965 at Derby Day, first day of the annual [[Melbourne Cup]] Carnival in Australia, where it caused a sensation. According to Shrimpton, who claimed that the brevity of the skirt was due mainly to Rolfe's having insufficient material, the ensuring controversy was as much as anything to do with her having dispensed with a hat and gloves, seen as the essential accessories in such conservative society.<ref>Jean Shrimpton ([[1990]]) ''An Autobiography''</ref>

==Development==

The miniskirt was further popularised by Andr<U+00E9> Courr<U+00E8>ges, who developed it separately and incorporated it into his [[Mod (lifestyle)|Mod]] look, for spring/summer 1965. His miniskirts were less body-hugging, and worn with the white "[[Go-go boots|Courr<U+00E8>ges boots]]" that became a trademark. By introducing the miniskirt into the [[haute couture]] of the fashion industry, Courr<U+00E8>ges gave it a greater degree of respectability than might otherwise have been expected of a street fashion. 

The miniskirt was followed up in the late 1960s by the even shorter ''micro skirt'', which has been referred to derogatorily as a [[belt (clothing)|belt]] or [[pelmet]]. Upper garments, such as rugby shirts, were sometimes adapted as mini-dresses. Tights or [[stockings#pantyhose|panty-hose]] became highly fashionable, in place of [[stockings]], specifically because the rise in hemlines meant that stocking tops would be visible. Mary Quant cited this development in defence of the miniskirt: "In European countries where they ban mini-skirts in the streets and say they're an invitation to rape, they don't understand about stocking tights underneath".<ref>Interview with Alison Adburgham, ''The Guardian'', 10 October 1967</ref> 

===1970s===
During the mid-[[1970s]], the fashion industry largely returned to longer skirts such as the ''midi'' and the ''maxi''. Journalist [[Christopher Booker]] gave two reasons for this reaction: firstly, that "there was almost nowhere else to go ... the mini-skirts could go no higher"; and secondly, in his view, "dressed up in mini-skirts and shiny [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] [[Mackintosh|macs]], given such impersonal names as 'dolly birds', girls had been transformed into throwaway plastic objects".<ref>Christopher Booker ([[1980]]) ''The Seventies''</ref> Certainly this lengthening of hemlines coincided with the growth of the [[feminist]] movement.  However, in the 1960s the mini had been regarded as a symbol of liberation, and it was worn by some, such as [[Germaine Greer]] and, in the following decade, [[Gloria Steinem]] [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1995/09/24/RV65259.DTL], who became known for their promotion of women's issues. Greer herself wrote in [[1969]] that:

<blockquote>The women kept on dancing while their long skirts crept up, and their [[girdles]] dissolved, and their nipples burst through like hyacinth tips and their clothes withered away to the mere wisps and ghosts of draperies to adorn and glorify ...<ref>Germaine Greer in ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'', February 1969</ref>.  </blockquote>

Indeed, miniskirts never entirely went away and, for example, were often worn by [[Deborah Harry]], of the group [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], during the "new wave" of the late 70s. The song ''(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea'' ([[1978]]) by new wave artist, [[Elvis Costello]], contained the line, "There's no place here for the mini-skirt waddle".

===1980s and 90s===
In the [[1980s]], short skirts began to re-emerge, notably in the form of "[[Rah-rah skirt|rah-rahs]]", which were modelled on those worn by female cheer-leaders at sporting and other events. In the mid-80s the "puffball" skirt enjoyed short term popularity, being worn by, among others, the [[Princess Diana|Princess of Wales]] and singers [[Pepsi and Shirlie]].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,5141915-103680,00.html Puff it, ''Guardian'']</ref> Many women began to incorporate the miniskirt into their business attire, a trend which grew during the remainder of the century. Films and television series made in the mid-[[1990s]] (''[[Friends]]'', ''[[Caroline in the City]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', for example) show how ubiquitous the mini had become again. In the BBC TV series ''[[Keeping Up Appearances]]'' ([[1990]]-[[1995|5]]) the snobbish [[Hyacinth Bucket]] was frequently outraged by the brevity of her sister [[Rose (Keeping Up Appearances character)|Rose's]] skirts.

===21st century===
Around the turn of the [[21st century]], [[Low-rise jeans|hipster trousers]] became highly fashionable for women. The micro has been reworked as an even less substantial beltskirt, which is more an evocation of the idea of a skirt than something that covers anything substantial. It may perhaps also provide rhythm for the hipline{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. Due to its revealing nature, the beltskirt is rarely worn in public. Miniskirts are also seen worn over trousers or [[jeans]], or with [[leggings]] that provide coverage of each leg from above the knee. Although "floaty" skirts were most closely associated with the [[boho-chic|boho]] look of the mid [[noughties]], short skirts also featured in some outfits and in London, for example, minis were more widespread during the hot summer of [[2006]] than for several years, a trend that continued through the mild autumn and winter and into the following spring <ref>See, for example, ''Sunday Times Style'', 18 March 2007.</ref>.
