'''Robert Clarkson Clothier''' (January 8, 1885 <U+2013> March 18, 1970) was the fourteenth President of [[Rutgers University]] serving from 1932 to 1951.

==Biography==
Robert was born in 1885 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] to Agnes Evans (1849<U+2013>1900) and Clarkson Clothier (1846<U+2013>1917). Clarkson was the brother of [[Isaac H. Clothier]], one of the founders of [[Strawbridge and Clothier]], the Philadelphia department store. After the death of his wife, Clarkson married Florence Merwin (c1860-1938). Robert had three sisters: Marion Clothier (1879<U+2013>1973), Edith Clothier (1881-?), and Florence (1883<U+2013>1888).

Robert attended [[The Haverford School]] from 1894 to 1903; then attended [[Princeton University]] where he was editor-in-chief of the [[Daily Princetonian]], and a member of the senior council. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree from Princeton in 1908, then worked for the [[Wall Street Journal]] as a reporter, and was the employment manager of [[Curtis Publishing Company]]. During [[World War I]] he was at the [[United States Department of War|War Department]]'s committee on classification of personnel, and was later commissioned a [[Lieutenant Colonel]] in the [[United States Army]]. He then served as a special representative for the [[Secretary of War]]. After the War he helped organize Scott Company, which were consultants in [[human resources]]. He then joined The Haverford School as assistant headmaster and then as headmaster. He married Nathalie Cowgill Wilson (1886<U+2013>1966) on June 24, 1916 and had three children: Agnes Evans Clothier (1917<U+2013>1961), Arthur Wilson Clothier (1919<U+2013>1942) and Robert Clarkson Clothier, Jr. (1925<U+2013>2003). In 1929, Clothier was appointed Dean of Men at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].

In 1932, he became President of [[Rutgers University]], and during his tenure, the university expanded from New Brunswick, New Jersey to acquire the "River Road Campus" (now known as the Busch campus), a 256 acre (1&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) tract in neighboring [[Piscataway, New Jersey]]. Further expansion was made to the campus of Cook College, the university's school of agriculture. During [[World War II]], Clothier positioned Rutgers within the domestic war effort, hosting the Army Student training program. Subsequent to the war, Clothier oversaw further expansion of Rutgers, especially as a result of the [[G.I. Bill]], and declared that the University would accommodate "all qualified veterans and high school graduates for whom it is possible to provide, not just those whom it is convenient to take."  In these years, also, Rutgers would become the State University, and incorporate the University of Newark (now [[Rutgers<U+2013>Newark]] campus) and the College of South Jersey (now [[Rutgers<U+2013>Camden]] campus).

In the summer of 1947 he served as president of the [[New Jersey State Constitution|New Jersey Constitutional Convention]], held in the College Avenue Gymnasium, that produced the state's third constitution. In 1951, Clothier retired from the presidency of [[Rutgers University]].<ref>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Clothier Retiring As Rutgers Head.
