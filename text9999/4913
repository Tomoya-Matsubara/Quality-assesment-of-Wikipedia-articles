'''Somaliland''' ([[Somali language|Somali]]: ''Soomaaliland'') is a [[List of unrecognized countries|''de facto'' independent]] [[republic]] located in the [[Horn of Africa]] within the internationally recognized borders of [[Somalia]]. On [[May 18]] [[1991]], the people of Somaliland declared independence from  Somalia. However, it was not recognized by any other country or international organization. The Republic of Somaliland consists of five administrative regions with a governor as the highest ranking leader of each region. The area encompasses roughly the former [[British Somaliland]] protectorate, an area of about 137,600 square kilometers (53,128&nbsp;[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]), which was briefly an independent country for five days in 1960. It is bordered by [[Ethiopia]] in the south, [[Djibouti]] in the west, the [[Gulf of Aden]] in the north, and the autonomous region [[Puntland]] in Somalia in the east. The capital of Somaliland is [[Hargeisa]].

==History==
The origins of the [[Somali people|Somali]]s and their time of entry into present-day Somalia have been debated, with many Somalis claiming descent from the [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian]] families who settled on the coast 1,000 years ago, and historians tracing the origins to pre-15th century agree.  By the 12th century, the ancestors of some of the clan families were already established in their present territories, while others moved southward through the 19th century.  The borders of Somalia were set at the end of the 19th century and a great number of Somalis were left out by the border placement, leaving them in eastern [[Ethiopia]] and northern [[Kenya]].

===Prehistoric Somaliland===
{{main|History of Somaliland}}

One of the great masterpieces the ancient civilization that inhabited present-day Somaliland produced what is thought to be the most significant [[Neolithic]] cave paintings in the [[Horn of Africa]] and the [[Africa|African continent]] in general - the [[Laas Geel]] rock paintings. These [[cave paintings]] are located in a site outside the capital [[Hargeisa]]. These paintings were untouched and intact for nearly 10,000 years until they were discovered recently. The paintings show these indigenous people worshipping cattle. There are also paintings of [[giraffe]]s, domesticated [[canine]]s and wild [[antelopes]]. The paintings show the cows wearing ceremonial robes while next to them are some of these people prostrating themselves in front of the cattle. The caves were discovered by a [[French people|French]] archaeological team during November and December 2002. Hence, the [[Laas Geel]] cave paintings have become a major tourist attraction and a national treasure.

===Axumite Somaliland===
{{main|Kingdom of Axum}}
 
The [[Kingdom of Axum]] encompassed modern day northern [[Ethiopia]], [[Djibouti]], [[Yemen]] and western Somaliland from about the [[3rd century]] to the [[6th century]] or [[7th century]] AD. Unfortunately little is known about the monarchy's impact and cultural significance, and no archaeological survey has been done in the [[Awdal]] and [[Wooqoyi Galbeed]] regions which could have proven if there were traders and settlers in the western regions of Somaliland.

===Early Islamic states in Western Somaliland===

With the introduction of Islam in the 10th century in what is now the Afar-inhabited parts of Eritrea and Djibouti, the region began to assume a political character independent of Ethiopia.  Three Islamic sultanates were founded in and around the area, initially subservient to the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]], named [[Shewa]] (a Semitic-speaking sultanate in eastern Ethiopia, modern Shewa province and ruled by the [[Mahzumi dynasty]]), [[Ifat]] (another Semitic-speaking<ref>Pankhurst, Richard. ''The Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History from Ancient Times to the End of the 18th Century'' (Asmara, Eritrea: The Red Sea, Inc., 1997)</ref> sultanate located in eastern Ethiopia in what is now eastern Shewa) and [[Adal]] and Mora (a sultanate centered around [[Zeila]], and later [[Harar]] in eastern Ethiopia and in Somaliland's [[Saaxil]] and [[Woqooyi Galbeed]] regions; Mora was located in what is now the southern [[Afar Region]] of Ethiopia and was subservient to Adal).

Over time, rebellions against Ethiopia (14th and 15th centuries) and political unification of the three sultanates under the [[Walashma dynasty]] of Adal created a strong Islamic state capable of achieving full independence from [[Ethiopia]] by the early 16th century.  In the mid 16th century Adal embarked on a great conquest of Ethiopia from its capital of [[Harar]], with disastrous results.  After the collapse of Adal, the part of Western Somaliland centered around Zeila became part of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] province of [[Habesh]].

===Eastern Somaliland under the Garad===

In the east, a completely different political dynamic existed.  The [[Warsangeli]] and [[Dhulbahante]] Sultanates under the Garad dynasty existed several centuries before the Three Sultanates of the west.  Unlike Adel, which was a direct successor of Axumite civilization with a wildly diverse ethnic makeup and a political system entirely based on Islam, the Garad Sultanates were very much Somali traditional administrations run under traditional democracy. The Warsangeli and Dhulbahante Sultanates were as advanced as the Adel and stretched beyond their clan inhabited area, as records show that their warriors formed a significant percentage of the army that invaded Ethiopia under [[Ahmed Gragn]].  After the Majerteen Sultanate formed and and Adel collapsed in the 16th and 17th centuries, the Garad state became much more of an eastern-oriented state.

===Colonial Somaliland===

Somaliland was once dominated by [[Ethiopia]] and at one time the [[Ottoman Empire]] annexed the city of [[Zeila]]. When the Ottoman Empire collapsed, [[Egypt]] occupied western parts of Somaliland (hence naming it ''Egyptian Somaliland''), the other regions being controlled by [[Somali people|Somali]] [[tribesmen]] and [[Arab]] settlers.

During [[Scramble for Africa|colonial times]], ''Egyptian Somaliland'' was taken over by the British. The region now claimed by Somaliland was annexed and officially became the [[British Somaliland]] [[Protectorate]].  British Somaliland became independent on [[26 June]] [[1960]] as the [[State of Somaliland]], and Italian Somaliland's independence came four days later, whereupon the two entities immediately merged on [[1 July]] [[1960]] as the [[Somali Republic]].

===Second Somaliland Republic===

In 1991, after the collapse of the central government in Somalia, the territory asserted its independence as the Republic of Somaliland.  It regarded itself as the successor state to the briefly-independent State of Somaliland but did not receive any international [[diplomatic recognition]].

The economic and military infrastructure left behind by Somalia has been largely destroyed by war. The people of Somaliland had rebelled against the [[Siad Barre]] dictatorship in [[Mogadishu]], which prompted a massive reaction by the government.

The late [[Abdirahman Ahmed AliTuur]] was the first president of Somaliland.  [[Mohamed Ibrahim Egal]] was appointed his successor in 1993 in [[Borama]], re-appointed in 1998, and remained in power until his death on [[May 3]], [[2002]]. The vice president [[Dahir Rayale Kahin]] was sworn in as president shortly afterwards, and in 2003 Kahin became the first Somaliland president to be elected in a free and fair election.

The 2006 [[War in Somalia (2006<U+2013>present)|War in Somalia]] between the [[Islamic Courts Union]] and the forces of [[Ethiopia]] and Somalia's transitional government has not directly affected Somaliland.

== Politics ==
{{main|Politics of Somaliland}}

Somaliland has formed a hybrid system of governance combining traditional and western institutions. In a series of inter-clan conferences, culminating in the [[Borama]] Conference in 1993, a ''beel'' (clan or community) system of government was constructed, which consisted of an Executive, with a President, Vice President, and Council of Ministers, a [[bicameral]] Legislature, and an independent judiciary. The traditional Somali council of elders (''guurti'') was incorporated into the governance structure and formed the upper house, responsible for selecting a President  as well as managing internal conflicts. Government became in essence a "power-sharing coalition of Somaliland's main clans",  with seats in the Upper and Lower houses proportionally allocated to clans according to a predetermined formula. In 2002, after several extensions of this interim government, Somaliland finally made the transition to multi-party democracy, with district council elections contested by six parties, considered the most peaceful in Africa for twenty years. [http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/03/07/news/somalia.php]

The district elections also determined which parties were allowed to contest the parliamentary and presidential elections, where a party was required to demonstrate at least twenty percent of the popular vote from four out of the six regions.  This important caveat ensured that parties would focus on consensus building and would not organize around ethnic lines. Subsequently, three parties were selected to submit presidential candidates: the [[UDUB|UDUB party]], [[Kulmiye]], and the [[For Justice and Development]].  On [[April 14]] [[2003]], 488,543 voters participated in the presidential elections, which ran more or less smoothly.  The result was a slim eighty vote controversial victory for UDUB over the Kulmiye, complicated by allegations of ballot stuffing against the incumbent UDUB. Despite calls for the Kulmiye to form a rival government, the party<U+2019>s leadership did not do so, instead choosing to abide by the ruling of the Supreme Court that upheld UDUB<U+2019>s victory. Despite minor demonstrations, the transition to the presidency of [[Dahir Riyale Kahin]] proceeded peacefully. This transition, combined with the fact that Kaahin was not a member of the dominant Isaaq clan, speaks volumes about the inter-clan commitment to peace-building and the rule of law, but we have to put in consideration that Dahir Riyale Kahin is from the second largest clan family in Somaliland which is the [[Gadabuursi]].The [[Issaq]] and the [[Gadabursi]] want a peaceful nation where  everyone is equal and they are not willing to get committed in severe civil war, this is the theory in the public eye. It could be, according to Steve Kibble, "the first indigenous modern African form of government." 

Somaliland boasts a constitution, a functional parliament and government ministries, an army, a police force, judiciary, and many of the signs of statehood, including a [[flag]], [[currency]], and [[passport]]s.  Nonetheless, it faces some significant problems to its continued survival. Like other Somali governments, it lacks a consistent taxation base and receives most of its support from private actors. Corruption remains a problem, women are virtually unrepresented in government, and there are growing concerns about voting patterns based on ethnic lines as well as the majority that UDUB has gained over both the regional councils and presidency as well as the parliament. Moreover, the large part of Somalilanders still harbor vivid memories of a predatory and extractive central state and are therefore wary of the construction of any strong central authority; this is evident in the importance placed on the role of the regional councils in dealing with local problems. 

Somaliland was a British Protectorate for over 80 years during the colonial period. In 1960, it gained independence but formed a hasty union with former Italian Somaliland to create the Somali Republic. In 1969 Mohamed Siad Barre<U+2019>s military coup brought Somalia<U+2019>s flirtation with democracy to an end and planted the seeds of a secessionist struggle in Somaliland. This struggle culminated in a brutal three-year civil war in which 50,000 people were killed and half a million refugees fled. Between 1988 and 1991, Barre<U+2019>s forces massacred civilians, laid over two million mines and reduced cities to rubble. 

In 1991, the overthrow of Barre<U+2019>s regime plunged Somalia into a state of chaos from which it is yet to emerge. Somaliland, however, was quick to declare independence and, over the years, it has managed to establish itself as a model of stability, good governance and economic discipline{{lopsided}}. Rival militias have been demobilized, mines have been cleared and refugees have been repatriated. The war-ravaged infrastructure has been rebuilt and Somaliland now boasts modern airports, hospitals, ports, power plants and universities. There is a free press and the central bank manages an official currency with relatively stable exchange rates. An unarmed police force and independent judiciary maintain order. 

What is most remarkable about this progress is that it has been achieved with virtually no external help. Whilst economic development has been heavily supported by Somalilanders in the Diaspora, lack of international recognition has meant that Somaliland does not qualify for bilateral aid or support from international financial institutions. This international isolation has not, however, resulted in isolationism. Lack of access to external aid has forced this country of 3.5-million people to become more self-reliant than many other African states. This self-reliance is reflected in what is perhaps the most significant of Somaliland<U+2019>s achievements: its system of government. 

Rather than having a Western democratic model of governance imposed on them from outside, Somaliland has managed to fuse Western-style institutions of government with its own traditional forms of social and political organization. Its bicameral parliament reflects this fusion of traditional and modern, with the senate consisting of traditional elders, and the House of Representatives consisting of elected representatives. 

However, with its history of <U+2018>tribalism<U+2019> and internecine fighting, the key challenge for Somaliland<U+2019>s new parliament is to try and replace clan-based politics with party politics. For its first twelve years, Somaliland had no political parties but instead followed more traditional clan-based forms of political organization. Political parties were introduced during the presidential elections and it was hoped that the recent parliamentary elections would help to usher in a representative system without allowing representation to be overtly clan-based. Clearly, if clan loyalties were to take precedence over party loyalties, parliament would be seriously weakened. The traditional clan-based political system had resulted in an under representation of some clans and it was hoped that having just three parties (all non-clan-based) would reduce the extent to which clan allegiance affected the selection of candidates and the way in which people voted. A limited number of political parties would force alliances between clans to develop thereby increasing integration and pluralism between the various clans inhabiting the country. 

In the traditional clan system it is the male elders who make decisions, and during the nomination process, many candidates were indeed selected by elders along clan lines. The male dominated nature of the selection process was reflected in the fact that only seven of the 246 candidates were female. There was also evidence that political parties often chose candidates based on their perceived popularity and support base. Whilst the absence of voter registration makes it hard to analyse voter patterns, it would seem from the results that there is some evidence that regional voting patterns reflect clan preferences. There is also evidence however, that alliances were sought between subgroups of different major clans across regions under the different party umbrellas. This would indicate that, although tribalism inevitably played some part in the election, it has been weakened. It will nevertheless be interesting to see how party loyalties will be negotiated against clan interests in the new parliament. 

In 2005 Somaliland joined the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation]] (UNPO), an international organization dedicated to the promotion of the right to [[self-determination]]. The UN still says there are some boundaries Somalialand will have to cross before it is recognized.

On [[March 1]], [[2006]], the [[Welsh Assembly]] invited [[Abdirahman Mohamed Abdillahi]], the speaker of the Somaliland parliament to the opening of a new Assembly building. Mr. Abdillahi said that Somaliland sees his invitation "as a mark of recognition by the National Assembly for Wales that [Somaliland has] legitimacy." The Somali community in Wales numbers 8-10,000, most of whom come from Somaliland.

In December 2006 representatives of the Somaliland Parliament again attended the Welsh Assembly receiving a standing ovation from its members. Two months earlier the Assembly approved the establishment of an aid budget for Africa. These moves were approved by the UK Foreign Office and Department for International Development and are seen as an attempt by the UK to encourage and reward the authorities in its former colony while avoiding the issue of formal recognition. <ref>{{cite news| title=Somaliland: Wales Strikes Out On Its Own In Its Recognition of Somaliland | date=6 Mar 2005 | publisher=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization | url=http://www.unpo.org/news_detail.php?arg=60&par=3905}}</ref>

== Regions ==
{{main|Regions of Somaliland}}
[[Image:Somaliland1_map.gif|400px|right|thumb|Map of Somaliland]]
The 6 regions of Somaliland are:
* [[Awdal]]
* [[Saaxil]]
* [[Togdheer]] 
* [[Woqooyi Galbeed]]
* [[Sanaag]]
* [[Sool]] 

The main cities and towns in the Republic of Somaliland are:

* [[Hargeisa]]
* [[Burao]]
* [[Berbera]]
* [[Borama]]
* [[Zeila|Saylac]]
* [[Erigavo]]
* [[Las anod]]

== Geography == 
[[Image:Borama.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Borama Mountains and fertile greenery]]
Somaliland is situated on the eastern horn of Africa and lies between the 08<U+00B0>00' - 11<U+00B0>30' parallel north of the equator and between 42<U+00B0>30' - 49<U+00B0>00' meridian east of Greenwich. It shares borders with the Republic of [[Djibouti]] to the west, the Federal Republic of [[Ethiopia]] to the south, the [[Puntland]] region to the northeast and [[Somalia]] to the southeast. Somaliland has 460 miles (740&nbsp;km) of coast with the majority along the [[Red Sea]]. Somaliland is slightly larger than [[England]] with an area of 137&nbsp;600&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (53&nbsp;100&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;miles).
[[Image:Saaylac.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Zeila]] coastline is situated in the [[Awdal]] region of Somaliland]] 

Somaliland's climate is a mixture of wet and dry. The northern part of the country is hilly and in many places the altitude ranges between 900 and 2,100 metres (3,000-7,000 ft) above sea level. The [[Awdal]], [[Saaxil]] and [[Wooqoyi Galbeed]] regions are fertile and mountainous, while the [[Togdheer]] is rather semi-desert with a few fertile greenery around. The [[Awdal]] region is known for its offshore islands, [[coral reef]]s and [[mangroves]].

Ten kilometers to the north of [[Erigavo]] are the remains of a [[juniper]] forest, running along the edge of the escarpment which looks down to the [[Gulf of Aden]]. The escarpment is approximately 2,000 [[metre]]s above [[sea level]], where the road from [[Erigavo]] drops down to the coast. Two kilometers to the west it rises to the highest point in Somaliland and [[Somalia]] alike; At 2,416 metres high, it is known variously as ([[Somali language|Somali]] [[Shimbiris]] or Shimbir Beris) meaning in [[English language|English]] ''the abode of the birds''.

Due to the fertility and greenery of some of the regions of Somaliland, wild animals (e.g. [[zebra]]s) come to the area; to either breed or graze on the grassland [[savannah]]. There are many animals which are native to Somaliland. The prominent animals found are the [[Kudu]], [[wild boar]], [[Somali Wild Ass]], [[warthogs]], [[antelope]]s, the [[Somali sheep]], wild [[goats]] and [[camel]]s. Moreover, many birds and different types of [[fish]] are also found in and around Somaliland.

== Economy ==
[[Image:Somaliland 100 shillings.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The obverse and reverse of the 100 [[Somaliland shilling]] note]]
Somaliland's economy is in its developing stages, as is Somaliland itself. The [[Somaliland shilling]], while stable, is not a [[currency]] recognized by any other [[government]], and currently has no official [[exchange rate]] with any other currency. The country's [[central bank]], the [[Bank of Somaliland]], was established under the auspices of the country's constitution in 1994. 

The bulk of Somaliland's exports are of livestock (whose quantity in Somaliland has been estimated at 24 million): in 1996, 3 million head of livestock were exported to the [[Middle East]] alone. In February 1998, [[Saudi Arabia]] banned imports of beef from Somaliland, however the country lifted the ban on [[December]] [[2006]]. Other exports include [[hide]]s, skins, [[myrrh]] and [[frankincense]].

There is considered to be "serious potential" for [[agriculture]], most significantly [[cereal]] production and [[horticulture]]. Mining currently consists solely of [[quarry]]ing, although there exist confirmed deposits of [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], [[gypsum]], [[lime (mineral)|lime]], [[mica]], [[quartz]], [[lignite|lignite coal]], [[lead]], [[gold]] and [[sulphur]], among others.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.somalilandgov.com/cprofile.htm | title= Republic of Somaliland Country Profile | work=Somaliland Official website | accessdate=2005-12-02}}</ref>

It is believed that the coast of Somaliland contain large deposits of [[crude oil]]; due to this the [[economy]] of Somaliland could boom. Unfortunately, foreign companies cannot invest and benefit from this because the country is internationally unrecognised.

==Tourism==

When Somaliland broke away from [[Somalia]], the tourism industry began to re-build itself. Somaliland is home to one of the most interesting attractions in the [[Horn of Africa]], the [[Laas Geel]] [[cave painting]]s. It is believed that a small number of tourists travel to the country to witness this sight. The paintings are situated near [[Hargeisa]] and were discovered by a [[French people|French]] archaeological team in 2002. The government and locals keep the cave paintings safe and only a restricted number of tourists are allowed. Other notable sights include the Freedom Arch in Hargeisa and the war memorial in the city center. Natural attractions are very common around the country. The [[Naasa Hablood]] hills are twin hills located on the outskirts of Hargeisa and are believed amongst Somalilanders to be a natural landmark. <!-- What's a "natural landmark"?? -->

The Ministry of Tourism has also encouraged travellers to visit historic towns and cities in Somaliland. The historic town of Sheikh is near [[Berbera]] and it is home to old British colonial buildings that have been untouched for nearly twenty years. Another equally famous historic city is [[Zeila]]. Zeila was once part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], a dependency of [[Yemen]] and [[Egypt]] and a major trade city during the 19th century. The city has been visited for its old colonial landmarks, offshore [[mangrove]]s and [[coral reef]]s and its towering cliffs and beach. The [[nomadic]] culture of Somaliland has also attracted tourists. Most nomads live in the countryside. An example is Salahley Savanah, an open [[savannah]] grassland which attracts animals from the region; nomads live in the area, grazing their [[livestock]]. Hotels are found in major cities of Somaliland, but not in smaller rural towns and villages. 

Somaliland wants part of its economy to be based on tourism but because of the lack of international recognition, the tourism industry is still in its developing stages.

== Demographics ==
There are about 3.5 million people living in Somaliland, and virtually all of the Somalis in the country are [[Sunni Muslims]]. 

===Languages===

Most people in Somaliland speak the country's two official languages: the [[Somali language]] and the [[Arabic language]], with  Article 6 of the Constitution of 2001 designating the official language of Somaliland to be [[Somali language|Somali]]. It is mandatory that Arabic be taught to school students and in [[mosque]]s around the country. [[English language|English]] is spoken and taught in schools.
 
Somali belongs to a set of languages called lowland [[Eastern Cushitic]] spoken by peoples living in Ethiopia, Somalia, [[Djibouti]], and Kenya. Eastern Cushitic is one section of the Cushitic language family, which in turn is part of the great [[Afro-Asiatic]] stock. [[Arabic]] is the most spoken language of the [[Afro-Asiatic]] language branches. It belongs to the [[Semitic languages]], together with [[Hebrew]] and [[Amharic]].

The main Somali dialect which is the most widely used is Common Somali, a term applied to several subdialects, the speakers of which can understand each other easily. Common Somali is spoken in most of Somaliland and [[Somalia]] and in adjacent territories (Ethiopia, Kenya, and Djibouti), and is used by broadcasting stations in Somaliland. 

Facility with language is highly valued in Somali society; the capability of a suitor, a warrior, or a political or religious leader is judged in part by his verbal adroitness. In such a society, [[oral poetry]] becomes an art, and one's ability to compose verse in one or more of its several forms enhances one's status. Speakers in political or religious assemblies and litigants in courts traditionally were expected to use poetry or poetic proverbs. Even everyday talk tended to have a terse, vivid, poetic style, characterized by carefully chosen words, condensed meaning, and alliteration. 

In the prerevolutionary era, [[English language|English]] became dominant in the school system and in government. However, the overarching issue was the development of a socioeconomic stratum based on mastery of a [[foreign language]]. The relatively small proportion of [[Somali people|Somali]]s (less than 10 percent) with a grasp of such a language--preferably [[English language|English]]--had access to government positions and the few managerial or technical jobs in modern private enterprises. Such persons became increasingly isolated from their nonliterate [[Somali language|Somali]]-speaking brethren, but because the secondary schools and most government posts were in urban areas the socioeconomic and linguistic distinction was in large part a rural-urban one.

Even before the 1969 revolution, Somalis had become aware of social stratification and the growing distance, based on language and literacy differences, between ordinary Somalis and those in government. The [[1972]] decision to designate an official Somali Latin script and require its use in government demolished the language barrier and an important obstacle to rapid literacy growth. 

In the years following the institution of the Somali Latin script, Somali officials were required to learn the [[orthography]] and attempts were made to inculcate mass literacy--in 1973 among urban and rural sedentary Somalis, and in 1974-75 among [[nomads]]. Although a few texts existed in the new script before 1973, in most cases new books were prepared presenting the government's perspective on Somali history and development. Somali scholars also succeeded in developing a vocabulary to deal with a range of subjects from mathematics and physics to administration and ideology. 

"The official language of the Republic of Somaliland is Somali, and the second language is Arabic."(art.6 of Constitution 2001)

===Religion===

Almost all Somalis are [[Sunni]] [[Muslims]]; [[Islam]] is the principal faith and state religion. Though traces of pre-Islamic traditional religion exist in Somaliland, Islam is extremely important to the Somali sense of national identity. Many of the Somali social norms come from their religion. For example, men shake hands only with men, and women shake hands with women. Many Somali women cover their heads and bodies with a [[hijab]] when they are in public. In addition, Somalis abstain from [[pork]], [[gambling]], and [[alcohol]], and receiving or paying any form of interest. Muslims generally congregate on Friday afternoons for a sermon and group prayer. Accordance with these prohibitions depends on each individual's level of [[orthodoxy]].

Nevertheless there has been Catholic missionary activity. In colonial days, [[British Somaliland]] was under the care of the [[Vicariate Apostolic of Arabia]], like the ''Vicariate Apostolic of the Gallas'' (including [[French Somaliland]] as well as its [[Ethiopia]]n main territory) confided to the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin]].

== Culture ==
===Clan system and marriage===
There are approximately 3.5 million people in Somaliland. The Somali society is organized into [[clan]] families, which range from 5,000 to over 50,000 in size. The major clan family in Somaliland are the [[Isaaq]]. The second clan family and also the clan family of the president is the [[Dir]]clan the sub clans [[Issa]] and [[Gadabursi]]. They are other clan family such as the [[Warsangeli]] and [[Dulbahante]] - a sub-group of the [[Darod]] clan system. The [[Warsangeli]]and [[Dhulbahante]] mostly reside in the [[Sool]], [[Sanaag]], [[Togdheer]] region of Somaliland, the [[Isaaq]]s  live in  [[Wooqoyi Galbeed]], [[Togdheer]] and some parts of [[Sool]] and [[Sanaag]] regions. The [[Gadabursi]] clan family lives in the western of the country [[Awdal region]] and Gabily district.  

The clan families are divided into lineage units, typically ranging from 2,500 to 10,000 members. It is possible for Somalis to know how they are related simply by giving their name and clan membership. Clan discrimination in Somaliland is highly forbidden and every clan is considered equal by the [[Politics of Somaliland|Government of Somaliland]].

[[Arranged marriage]]s are common. However, most Somalis choose to marry who ever they desire as long as they are Muslims. In the case of arranged marriages, brides are usually much younger than the grooms. Marriage to a cousin from the mother's side of the family (of a different lineage) is traditionally favored to strengthen family alliance, but this practice is not as common as earlier. Virginity is valued in women prior to marriage. In addition, divorce is legal in Somaliland. Romantic marriages are becoming more common and are now the majority of marriages in Somaliland. But even these choices are influenced by the partner's clan.

===Cuisine===
{{main|Cuisine of Somaliland}}
[[Image:Bariis.idolashiilay3.JPG|right|200px|thumb| ''Bariis Iskudhexkaris'', is a traditional vegetables and rice dish, served with a lamb stew.]]
It is considered polite for one to leave a little bit of food on a plate after finishing a meal at another's home. This tells the host that one has been given enough food. If one were to clean his or her plate that would indicate that he or she is still hungry. Most Somalis don't take this rule so seriously, but it is certainly not impolite to leave a few bits of food on one's plate. Traditionally, the main meal of the day is eaten at lunchtime and Somali people usually begin their day with a flat bread called [[Laxoox]] or La'hooh, liver, toast, cereal or porridge made of millet or cornmeal. Lunch can be a mix of rice or noodles with meat and sauce. When the [[Italians]] ruled the [[Horn of Africa]] they brought some of their cuisine to Somaliland for example ''Pasta Al Forno'' (in [[Somali language|Somali]] ''Paasto Forno''} and they also planted [[bananas]] in the south of the region. Also during Lunch their diet may consist of a traditional soup called ''maraq'' (It is also part of [[Yemeni|Yemen]] cuisine) made of vegetables, meat and beans and usually eaten with [[Flat bread]] or [[Pitta bread]]. Later in the day a lighter meal is served which includes [[beans]], [[Ful medames]], muffo (patties made of oats or corn), [[Hummus]] or a salad with more [[Laxoox]]/[[Injera]]. A minority of [[Somali people|Somali]]s drink [[Turkish coffee]] which they brought from Arab countries to their homeland. [[Turkish tea]] is also drunk in Somaliland; it has been adapted to become one of the famous drinks in the region - the traditional and cultural ''Shaax Xawaash''. Consumed by the majority of Somalis, it is made of [[cardamom]] (Somali ''Xawaash''} and [[cinnamon|cinnamon barks]] (Somali ''Qoronfil'').

===Arts===
{{main|Culture of Somaliland}}
[[Islam]] and [[poetry]] have been described as the twin pillars of Somali culture. Most Somalis are Sunni Muslims and Islam is vitally important to the Somali sense of national identity. Most Somalis don't belong to specific [[mosque]] or sect and can pray in any mosque they find. 

Celebrations come in the form of religious festivities, two of the most important being [[Eid al Adha]] and [[Eid al Fitr]] which marks the end of the fasting month. Families get dressed up to visit one another. Money is donated to the poor. Other holidays include [[June 26]], which celebrates Somaliland's independce, however it is unrecognised by the international community. 

In a [[nomadic]] culture, where one's possessions are frequently moved, there is little reason for the [[plastic arts]] to be highly developed. Somalis embellish and decorate their woven and wooden milk jugs (Somali ''Haano'', the most decorative jugs are made in [[Erigavo]])  and their wooden headrests, and traditional dance is important; though mainly as a form of courtship among young people. The traditional dance known as the ''Ceeyar Somaali'' in the [[Somali language]] is Somaliland's favourite dance. 

[[Image:Henna for hair.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Henna powder is mixed with [[water]] and then applied on the hair]]
Also, an important form of art in Somaliland is [[mendhi|henna painting]] (Somali: Xenna). The [[Henna|Henna plant]] is widely grown across the region and it was [[Arab]] merchants and settlers that first brought the art of [[mendhi|Henna painting]] in early Somaliland. During special occasions, a Somali women's hands and feet are expected to be covered in decorative [[mendhi]]. Girls and women usually apply or decorate their hands and feet in [[henna]] on joyous celebrations like [[Eid]], weddings etc. The henna designs can be very simple to highly intricate. Unlike [[Pakistan|Pakistani]], [[India|Indian]] or [[Bangladesh|Bangladeshi]] henna designs, the Somali and [[Arab]] designs are more modern and simple compared to the latter. Traditionally, only women apply this [[body art]] and it is absolutely strange for men to apply such art on their hands and feet.

[[Henna]] is not only applied on the hands and feet but at the same time it is used as a [[dye]]. Somali men and women alike use henna as a dye to change their [[hair colour]]. Mostly, elderly men with grey hair apply such procedure because black hair dye is forbidden in [[Islam]]. Women are free to apply henna on their hair as most of the time they are wearing a [[hijab]].

Saving face is very important to Somalis, so indirectness and humor are often used in conversation. Somalis deeply value the family with the strength of family ties providing a safety net in times of need and suffering.
