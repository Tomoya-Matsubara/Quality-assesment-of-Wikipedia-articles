'''Papoose Peak Jumps''' was a [[ski jumping hill]] located at [[Squaw Valley Ski Resort]] in the US state of [[California]]. The hill consisted of three jumps, with [[K-point]]s of 80, 60 and 40 meters, respectively. Constructed upon the hill-side of Little Papoose Peak, it was built for the [[1960 Winter Olympics]]; the 80-meter hill hosted the [[ski jumping at the 1960 Winter Olympics|ski jumping event]] and the 60-meter hill the [[Nordic combined at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Nordic combined event]]. The jump was designed by [[Heini Klopfer]] and opened in 1958. After the Olympics the venue saw little use; it was renovated for the 1976 US National Ski Jumping Championships, but has since been demolished and the hillside now features a [[ski lift]].

==History==
As Squaw Valley was a undeveloped area when it was awarded the Olympics, the organizing committee was free to design a tailor-made Olympic resort.<ref>Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 33</ref> Heini Klopfer from [[Oberstdorf]], West Germany, was hired to design the ski jumping hills, which he finished in early 1957. He chose to locate it on the hill-side of Little Papoose Peak, opposite [[Blyth Arena]]. He described the location as "the type of hill one always seeks but seldom finds".<ref name=s103>Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 103</ref> The construction contract was awarded to Diversified Builders, who constructed the jumps during the summer and fall of 1958.

Papoose Peak Jumps was the first Olympic ski jump to have three [[ski jump|in-runs]].<ref name=s103 />   Minor details were corrected in 1959 and 1960. It was renovated ahead of the 1976 US National Championships.<ref name=skisprungschanzen>{{cite web |url=http://www.skisprungschanzen.com/EN/Ski+Jumps/USA-United+States/CA-California/Squaw+Valley/0578/ |title=Papoose Peak Jumps |publisher=Ski Jumping Hill Archive |accessdate=21 June 2012 |archivedate=21 June 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68aoW89n1 |deadurl=no}}</ref> However, it fell out of use afterwards and instead the hill was converted to a [[speed skiing]] and [[snowboarding]] hill. Later the resort's Far East Express chairlift was installed on the hill.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/1960/SKJ/ |title=Ski Jumping at the 1960 Squaw Valley Winter Games |publisher=Sports Reference |accessdate=21 June 2012 |archivedate=21 June 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68aoaPS0M |deadurl=no}}</ref>

==Facilities==
The hill consisted of three jumps with a common out-run, each with a [[construction point]] (K-point) of 80, 60 and 40 meters, respectively.<ref name=skisprungschanzen /> It was located in the central area of the Olympic resort, next to the skating rinks and the Olympic Village. Tall trees on both sides of the hill gave good protection against the wind. The location was also ideal because of the sun was at the competitor's backs. A judges' tower was constructed on the side, which was both accessible by stairs from the bottom of the hill or from the chairlift which ran to the top of the in-runs.<ref name=s103 /> The hill had an overall height of {{convert|140|m|sp=us}}, the in-run had a length of {{convert|113|m|sp=us}}. The largest jump had a take-off angle of 8.5 degrees and a landing angle of 38 degrees.<ref name=skisprungschanzen />

==Events==
The first competitive use of the hills was the trial Olympics in February 1959. During the 1960 Winter Olympics, the 80-meter hill was used for special jumping on 28 February,<ref name=s105>Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 105</ref> while the 60-meter hill was used for Nordic combined  on 22 February.<ref name=s106>Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 106</ref> The [[ski jumping at the 1960 Winter Olympics|special ski jumping event]] was won by [[Helmut Recknagel]] of [[Germany at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Germany]], who also set a hill record of {{convert|93.5|m|sp=us}}. He was followed up by [[Finland at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Finland]]'s [[Niilo Halonen]] and [[Austria at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Austria]]'s [[Otto Leodolter]].<ref name=s105 /> In the ski jumping part of the [[Nordic combined at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Nordic combined event]], Germany's [[Georg Thoma]] received the highest points ahead of the [[Soviet Union at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Soviet Union]]'s [[Dmitriy Kochkin]] and [[Norway at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Norway]]'s [[Tormod Knutsen]].<ref name=s106 /> The cross-country part of the event took place at [[McKinney Creek Stadium]].<ref>Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 110</ref> While Thoma won the discipline overall, Knutsen finished second overall ahead of the Soviet Union's [[Nikolai Gusakov]].<ref name=s106 /> In 1976, the US National Championships in Ski Jumping were held at the large hill, and was won by [[Jim Denney]].<ref name=skisprungschanzen />
