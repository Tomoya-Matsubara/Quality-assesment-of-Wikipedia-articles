Upon returning to the freighter, Keamy unsuccessfully attempts to kill [[Michael Dawson (Lost)|Michael Dawson]] ([[Harold Perrineau]]), whom he has discovered is Ben's spy, then obtains the "secondary protocol" from a safe.

The protocol contains details about a 1980s research station called the "Orchid" that was previously run by a group of scientists working for the [[Dharma Initiative]]. Keamy is also informed by Captain Gault that Keamy and his mercenary squad may be suffering from some sort of mental sickness,  a notion Keamy dismisses.

Durand was never informed of his character's arc and only learned more of Keamy's importance to the plot as he received new scripts; thus, he was thrilled when the role was expanded for his third appearance, in "The Shape of Things to Come", when he kills Alex and Durand compared his excitement to that of "a kid in a candy store."<ref name=sunmedia/>  He also stated that "you really don't know what's going to happen in the next episode and you get the scripts pretty late, so it is pretty secretive and it's kind of exciting that way [because] you're really forced to get in the moment and say the words and play the guy".<ref name=source/>  Durand was initially met with negative reaction from fans on the street for this action and he defended his murderous character by arguing that it was actually more Ben's fault for failing to negotiate with Keamy; later, fans warmed up to Keamy.

Reaction to the antagonist's death was mixed.  [[Kristin Dos Santos]] of [[E!]] criticized the writing for Keamy when he futilely asks Sayid where his fellow 815 survivors are so that he can kill them, but enjoyed his attractive physique, writing that "that guy is deep-fried evil, and he must die horribly for what he did to Alex, but in the meantime, well, he's certainly a well-muscled young man".<ref>[[Kristin Dos Santos|Dos Santos, Kristin]], (May 8, 2008) "[http://ca.eonline.com/gossip/kristin/detail/index.jsp?uuid=657711a1-117a-4dca-b09d-cbe304c33f16 'Destiny is a Fickle Bitch']", [[E!]].
