'''''Ani Ma'amin''''' (<U+05D0><U+05E0><U+05D9> <U+05DE><U+05D0><U+05DE><U+05D9><U+05DF>) "I believe" is a prosaic rendition of [[Maimonides]]' thirteen-point version of the [[Jewish principles of faith]]. It is based on his [[Mishnah]] commentary to tractate [[Sanhedrin]]. The popular version of ''Ani Ma'amin'' is of a later date and has some significant differences with Maimonides' original version. It is of unknown authorship. Both ''Ani Ma'amin'' and a poetic version, ''[[Yigdal]]'', form part of the prayers of Jews and have inspired varied settings to music.

==Form==
The recitation consists of thirteen lines, each beginning with the phrase "''Ani ma'amin be-emunah shelemah''" ("I believe with perfect faith"). It follows the same order as Maimonides' enumeration.

==In prayer==
Many Jews recite Ani Ma'amin at the conclusion of their [[Jewish services|morning prayers]]. The poetic version ''Yigdal'' is more commonly recited at the beginning of the prayers. In some communities ''Yigdal'' is also recited on the [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holidays|holidays]] after the evening service.

==Culture==
The penultimate line refers to the essential Jewish belief in the coming of the [[Jewish Messiah|Mashiach]]. As such, this line has become a popular source of lyrics for Jewish songs.

The original version of the tune is attributed to the [[Modzitz (Hasidic dynasty)|Modzits Hasidim]], who reportedly sang the song as they were herded into the gas chambers of the Nazi [[concentration camps]]. The song was then adopted by other Jewish prisoners and became known as the ''Hymn of the Camps''. It is still frequently sung at [[Holocaust Remembrance Day]] services. Some also sang it at the [[Passover]] [[seder]], in memory of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] which began on the first night of Passover in 1943. 

''Ani Ma'amin'' is also used as a positive song included at happy events, mainly weddings. The words are the same, but a much happier tune is used. The popular [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] singer [[Avraham Fried]] has recorded a version of this song that has gained popularity, reflecting the Chabad-Lubavitch's emphasis on the imminent coming of the Messiah.

''Ani Ma'amin'' was sung by the choir during [[Pope John Paul II]]'s historic visit to the [[Synagogue of Rome]] on April 13, 1986.
