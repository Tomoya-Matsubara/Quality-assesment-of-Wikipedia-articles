{{nihongo|'''Tatsugo Kawaishi'''|<U+6CB3><U+77F3> <U+9054><U+543E>|Kawaishi Tatsugo|December 10, 1911 <U+2013> March 17, 1945}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] swimmer who competed at the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]].

A native of [[<U+014C>gaki, Hiroshima]] (currently part of the city of [[Etajima, Hiroshima]]), Kawaishi was a graduate of the law school of [[Keio University]], and began competitive swimming as a student.

Selected for the Japanese Olympic team in the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics, he won a silver medal in the [[Swimming at the 1932 Summer Olympics <U+2013> Men's 100 metre freestyle|100 m freestyle event]]; however, his achievement was overshadowed by his teammate [[Yasuji Miyazaki]], who won the gold medal and who set a new Olympic record. After his return to Japan, he became an instructor at the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy]] from 1933-1935. He then moved to [[Osaka]], and was employed by the forerunner of [[Kansai Electric]]; however, he then enlisted in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and was accepted into the Hiroshima-based IJA 11th Infantry Regiment. He was sent to serve on the front lines in China during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] after five years. Upon is discharge, he returned to work at Kansai Electric; however, during the [[Pacific War]], as the situation worsened for Japan, he was recalled to active duty in June 1944 and was assigned to the garrison at [[Iwo Jima]], where General [[Tadamichi Kuribayashi]] made him commander of the northern district of the island. He was killed in combat during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] on March 17, 1945 and was posthumously promoted to captain.
