The '''Jaguar XK120''' was a [[sports car]] manufactured by [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] between 1948 and 1954. Jaguar's first post-war sports car, it succeeded the [[Jaguar SS100|SS 100]], which ceased production in 1940.  

The XK120 was launched in roadster form at the 1948 [[London Motor Show]] as a [[testbed]] and show car for the new [[Jaguar XK6 engine|Jaguar XK engine]]. It caused a sensation, which persuaded [[William Lyons]] to put it into production. 

The "120" in its name referred to its 120 mph (193 km/h) top speed (faster with the windscreen removed), which made the XK120 the world's fastest standard production car at the time of its launch.<ref>{{cite book

It was available in two [[convertible]] versions <U+2014> first as the [[roadster]] (designated OTS, for open two-seater, in America), then also as a drophead coup<U+00E9>, or DHC, from 1953 <U+2014> and as a closed, or "fixed-head" [[coup<U+00E9>]] (FHC) from 1951.
 
The roadster version was popular with Hollywood stars such as Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Clark Gable and Lauren Bacall.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

==Production==
The first 242 cars, all 1949-model roadsters hand-built in late 1948, had aluminium bodies on [[Ash tree|ash]] frames. To meet demand it was necessary for the mass-production versions, beginning with the 1950 model year, to have pressed-steel bodies. They retained aluminium doors, [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]], and [[Trunk (automobile)|boot]] lid. 

==Construction==
Power came from a [[dual overhead cam]] 3.4&nbsp;L [[straight-6]] engine, Jaguar's famous [[Jaguar XK6 engine|XK unit]]. With alloy [[cylinder head]] and twin side draft [[SU carburetor]]s, the engine was very advanced for a mass-produced unit, developing {{convert|160|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} <ref name=Motor1949/> with the standard 8:1 compression ratio. A 7:1 low compression version of the engine was also available to cope with low quality fuel. This same basic design of the XK engine, later modified into 3.8L and 4.2L versions, survived into the late 1980s.

All XK120s had independent [[torsion bar suspension|torsion bar front suspension]], semi-elliptic leaf springs at the rear, recirculating-ball steering, telescopically adjustable steering column, and all-round drum brakes that were prone to fade. The roadster's lightweight canvas top and detachable sidescreens stowed out of sight behind the seats, and its [[barchetta]]-style doors had no external handles; instead there was an interior pull-cord which was accessible through a flap in the sidescreens when the weather equipment was in place. The windscreen could be removed for [[Windshield#terminology|aeroscreens]] to be fitted.

The drophead coup<U+00E9> had a padded canvas top, which folded onto the rear deck behind the seats when not in use, and roll-up windows. The windscreen was fixed. Dashboards in both the FHC and DHC were wood-veneered, whereas the roadster's was leather-trimmed. All models had removable [[Fender skirts|spats ("fender skirts" in America]]) covering the rear wheel arches, which enhanced the streamlined look. On cars fitted with optional centre-lock [[wire wheels]] (available from 1951), the spats were omitted as they gave insufficient clearance for the two-eared [[Rudge-Whitworth]] knockoff hubs.

In addition to wire wheels, upgrades on the Special Equipment, or SE, version (called the M version in the United States) included increased power, stiffer suspension and dual exhaust system.

==Performance==
An XK120 roadster with all weather gear in place tested by [[The Motor (magazine)|The Motor]] magazine in 1949 had a top speed of {{convert|124.6|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and could accelerate from 0-{{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 10.0 seconds. A fuel consumption of {{convert|19.8|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus}} was recorded. The test car cost <U+00A3>1263 including taxes. <ref name=Motor1949>{{cite journal | authorlink = Unsigned |title = The Jaguar 2-seater Type XK120 Road Test| journal =[[The Motor (magazine)|The Motor]]| volume = | pages = | date = 1949}}</ref>

==Racing and rallying==
In 1949 [[Leslie Johnson]] achieved the XK120's first-ever race victory, in the [[Daily Express]]-sponsored One-Hour Production Car Race at [[Silverstone Circuit]], England.  The factory-owned car was an alloy-bodied roadster road-registered as HKV 500. Two other XK120s took part. One, driven by [[Peter Walker]], finished second and the other, driven by [[Prince Bira]], spun out of contention when a tire punctured. In January 1950 Johnson also scored the model<U+2019>s first competition success in America, winning the production class in a race at [[Palm Springs]], Florida with the car that had finished second at Silverstone. <ref name=Porter>Porter, Philip (1998). ''Jaguar Sports Racing Cars'', Bay View Books. ISBN 1-901432-21-1</ref>

In 1950 Jaguar allocated six alloy-bodied XK120s to drivers Johnson, Walker, Nick Haines, [[Clemente Biondetti]], Ian Appleyard and [[Tom Wisdom]]. Three were entered for the [[1950 24 Hours of Le Mans|1950 Le Mans 24 Hours]] race, where Johnson and co-driver Bert Hadley ran as high as second, but retired from third in the 21st hour with clutch failure. (As a consequence the clutch design was revised for production models.) The Jaguar had been catching the leader at a rate that would have seen it in the lead before the full 24&nbsp;hours had elapsed<ref>Buckley, Martin: ''Jaguar: Fifty Years of Speed and Style''  p.120. Haynes Publishing 2003, ISBN 1-85960-872-2</ref> Haines, with co-driver Peter Clark, finished 12th, and Walker<U+2019>s car, driven by [[Peter Whitehead]] and John Marshall, was 15th.<ref name=Porter/> The results by the three cars convinced William Lyons it was worth investing in future success at Le Mans.<ref name=Tim>Nevinson, Tim: "Flat out for a week" ''Thoroughbred and Classic Cars''  June 2008 p. 84.</ref>

In the 1950 [[Targa Florio]], Biondetti<U+2019>s XK120 lay second to [[Alberto Ascari]]<U+2019>s Ferrari when a [[connecting rod]] broke, ending the Jaguar<U+2019>s run. The same year, Johnson<U+2019>s XK120 finished fifth in the [[Mille Miglia]], the best-ever result in this race by an Englishman driving a British car; Biondetti and co-driver Gino Bronzoni were eighth.<ref>[http://www.xkdata.com/gallery/zoom/?id=87677] Photograph of Biondetti's XK120 prepared for the 1950 Mille Miglia.</ref> Five XK120s contested the 1950 Production Car Race at Silverstone. Peter Walker won, with [[Tony Rolt]] second. Johnson, Whitehead and 21-year-old [[Stirling Moss]] raced XK120s in the 1950 [[Tourist Trophy]] at [[Dundrod]]. Moss, his car borrowed from Tom Wisdom, won in heavy rain.<ref name=Porter/> 

Ian Appleyard's XK120, road-registered as NUB 120, won both the 1950 Alpine and 1951 Tulip rallies with Appleyard at the wheel and his wife Pat navigating.<ref name=Porter/>

On February 1, 1954, an XK120 FHC won Australia's first 24-hour race, the [[1954 Mount Druitt 24 Hours Road Race|Mount Druitt 24 Hours]], from a [[Bristol 400]] and a [[Humber Super Snipe]]. 

In America, an XK120 FHC was the first imported car to achieve victory in [[NASCAR]], when [[Al Keller]]<ref>[http://www.legendsofnascar.com/Al_Keller.htm] "Al Keller" ''Legends of NASCAR'' website, includes photo of Keller with XK120.</ref> won the first NASCAR road race, held at [[Linden Airport]], New Jersey, on June 13th, 1954.

==Record-breaking==

XK120s set numerous world records on the steeply banked oval track at the [[Autodrome de Montlh<U+00E9>ry]], near [[Paris]]: 

*'''1950''' {{convert|107.46|mi/h|km/h|2|abbr=on}} for 24&nbsp;hours: Leslie Johnson sharing his XK120 roadster with Stirling Moss.

*'''1951''' {{convert|131.83|mi|km|2|abbr=on}} in one hour: Johnson solo. "No mean feat...driving at almost twice today's maximum ''(UK)'' speed limit into a steep turn, assaulted by the g-force induced by 30&nbsp;degree banking twice every minute, using Forties technology, leaf spring suspension and narrow crossply tyres...Johnson remarked that the car felt so good it could have gone on for another week, an off-the-cuff comment that sowed the seed for another idea. Flat out for a week..."<ref name=Tim/>

*'''1952''' {{convert|100.31|mi/h|km/h|2|abbr=on}} for 7&nbsp;days and 7 nights: XK120 fixed-head coup<U+00E9> driven by Johnson, Moss, Hadley and [[Jack Fairman]]. [[William Lyons]], mindful of the considerable kudos and advertising mileage that had already accrued from Johnson's exploits, commandeered a brand new gold-colored XK120 FHC for him: it was Jaguar chief engineer [[Walter Hassan]]'s car, the second right-hand drive coup<U+00E9> made.<ref name=Tim>Nevinson, Tim: "Flat out for a week" ''Thoroughbred and Classic Cars''  June 2008 p. 84.</ref> The car broke a spring on the track's rough concrete surface when already well into the run. No spare was carried, and regulations stipulated that a replacement from outside would make the car ineligible for any further records beyond those already achieved before the repair. Johnson drove nine hours to save the other drivers from added risk while the speed had to be maintained on the broken spring. When he finally stopped to have it replaced, the car had taken the world and Class C 72-hour records at {{convert|105.55|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, world and Class C four-day records at {{convert|101.17|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, Class C 10,000-kilometer record at {{convert|107.031|mi/h|km/h|3|abbr=on}}, world and Class C 15,000-kilometer records at {{convert|101.95|mi/h|km/h|2|abbr=on}}, and world and Class C {{convert|10000|mi|km|sing=on}} records at {{convert|100.65|mi/h|km/h|2|abbr=on}}.  After the repair the car went on to complete the full seven days and nights, covering a total of {{convert|16851.73|mi|km|abbr=on}} at an average speed of {{convert|100.31|mi/h|km/h|2|abbr=on}}.
