'''Beguildy''' ({{lang-cy|Bugeildy}}) is a small village and geographically large [[Community (Wales)|community]] in [[Powys]], [[Wales]].

It lies in a remote tract of countryside, {{convert|8|mi|km}} northwest of [[Knighton, Powys|Knighton]], on the [[B4355 road]] to [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]]. It lies near the [[Source (river or stream)|headwaters]] of the [[River Teme]] and has an [[elevation]] of {{convert|254|m|ft}}. The name means "the shepherd's house", a reference to the [[pastoral]] occupation of its inhabitants.

The village has four of the five "Ps" identified by ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' as essential to a successful village: a [[pub]] (''the Radnorshire Arms''), a post office, a place of worship and a primary school. Sadly public transport is poor but by way of compensation it does have a shop.

==Church==
The church, which is mainly 14th century was restored considerably in the last century. The [[chancel]] was rebuilt in 1885 and the [[nave]] restored in 1896. The original tower collapsed in the 19th century and bells which date from 1661 and 1664, were re-hung in their present position in 1936.

The church features a 14th century [[octagon]]al [[baptismal font|font]] (which reputed to carry marks made by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's]] troops sharpening their swords), a holy water [[stoup]] at the south door, and a priests door in the south wall. The screen is a fine example of 15th century workmanship and is well preserved, bearing the original coloured [[Tudor Rose]]s. Probably from the same period are two oak benches. The dug out chest, which was reputedly hewn out of a solid block of timber, is an ancient [[churchwarden]]'s chest and probably dates form the 13th century. At the end of the chest is an iron ring for use when it was drawn by a horse to be buried or hidden in times of trouble. One part of the chest would have held the church valuables and the other the churchwardens treasures. Each compartment was locked separately. The church is well endowed with 20th century [[stained glass]] windows.

==Associations==
John Dee ([[Black Jack]]) was born in Beguildy in 1527 and served at the court of [[Elizabeth I]], as the [[tutor|royal tutor]] in [[mathematics]]. He later became the Queen's [[Ambassador]] to [[Poland]] but is remembered as a distinguished scientist and astronomer. He was reputedly a descendant of [[Rhodri Mawr]], King of Wales.
