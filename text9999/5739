"'''Liverpool 8'''" is a song by [[Ringo Starr]] and is the lead track on his 2008 [[Liverpool 8|album of the same name]]. The song was also released in early December 2007 as a [[Music download|download]]-[[single (music)|single]].  It is an [[autobiography]] of Starr put to song, with emphasis on his time with [[The Beatles]].  The title refers to the postal district of the [[Toxteth]] area of [[Liverpool]], [[England]] in which Starr was born. The song was noted by some in the press for its absurdly simplistic and inane lyrics and nursery rhyme like melody.

As of January 3, 2008, the song was being played on [[Beatles Radio]], a [[streaming]] [[radio station]]. It was later released in physical formats ([[gramophone record|7"]] and [[CD single|CD]]) on January 7, 2008, a week before the release of the album. The [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] for the 7" is the third track from the album, "For Love". Despite the physical single being available for only 99 pence in the UK, it only reached #99 there.
