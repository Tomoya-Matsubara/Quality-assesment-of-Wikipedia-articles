==== World War II ====
[[Image:14fg-emblem.jpg|left|125px]]
The '''14th Pursuit Group''' was activated on 15 January 1941 at [[Hamilton AFB|Hamilton Field]], [[California]]. Reassigned to [[March AFB|March Field]] in California in early June 1941.  Trained with [[Curtiss P-40]]s, [[P-43 Lancer]]s and [[P-38 Lightning|P-38D/E Lightnings]].  Reassigned back to Hamilton Field on 7 February 1942 to receive operational P-38F and flew flying patrols on the west coast of the US after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]].   Although these fighters were not yet combat ready, these outfits had the only truly modern fighters then available to the USAAF, and provided West Coast defense at a time that Japanese attacks on the US mainland were believed to be imminent. 

Even though the defense of the US west coast initially took priority, plans were made in the spring of 1942 to deploy the 14th and other P-38 squadrons to [[Great Britain]].  Redesignated the '''14th Fighter Group''' in May 1942. The Ground echelon departed 16 July 1942 on the first stage of the movement to [[England]]. They sailed on the USS West Point in early August 1942, and arrived in [[Liverpool]] on 17th Aug 1942. The air echelon departed to [[Bradley International Airport|Bradley Field]], [[Connecticut]] on July 1st 1942. They flew P-38s to the United Kingdom via the nortern ferry route. The first aircraft departed [[Presque Isle Air Force Base|Presque Isle]], [[Maine]] on 22 July 1942. The 50th Fighter Squadron remained in [[Iceland]] and was reassigned to the 342d Composite Group to assist the Curtiss P-40Cs of the 33rd Fighter Squadron in the flying of defensive patrols over the [[Atlantic]].   

This was the first transatlantic crossing successfully made by single-seat fighters.  In Britain, the group was stationed at [[RAF Atcham]] as part of [[Eighth Air Force]].

The 14th was reassigned to [[Twelfth Air Force]] XII Fighter Command on the 14th of September 1942, but continued to operate under VIII Fighter Command until mid-October flying sweeps over [[France]] and performing practice missions under the [[Royal Air Force]]'s guidance.

The Ground echelon left Atcham on the 30th of October 1942, and sailed on the USS Brazil and USS Uruguay from Liverpool and arrived in [[Oran]], [[Algeria]] on the 10th of November 1942. The air echelon departed for [[North Africa]] on the 6th of November 1942, and flew to Tafaraoui airfield, Algeria from the 10th to the 14th of November 1942

From bases in [[Algeria]], and later [[Tunisia]], the group flew escort, strafing, and reconnaissance missions from the middle of Nov 1942 to late in Jan 1943.  The Lightnings were soon in regular combat in the [[North African Campaign]]. The 14th contributed a great deal toward the establishment of local air superiority in the area, being effective against bombers and had wreaked great havoc among [[Afrika Korps|Rommel's air transport]] well out to sea.  The P-38s earned the German nickname "der Gabelschwanz Teufel"--the Fork-Tailed Devil.    In January 1943, the 14th was withdrawn from combat, with some of the men and planes being reassigned to the [[1st Fighter Wing|1st]] and [[82d Training Wing|82d]] groups.

The group resumed operational combat operations in May, being re-equipped with the P-38F and some P-38Gs. Already prior to the Axis defeat in Tunisia, the Northwest African Air Forces (of which the Twelfth Air Force was a component) had begun preparations for the invasion of [[Sicily]]. Attacks on Sicily, on [[Pantelleria]] and on [[Lampedusa]] were stepped up in preparation for [[Operation Husky]], the invasion of Sicily on July 10, 1943.  The group flew dive-bombing missions during the Allied assault on Pantelleria. Helped prepare for and support the invasions of Sicily and [[Italy]].  Lieut H. T. Hanna of the 14th Fighter Group made ace in one day by destroying five [[Junkers Ju 87]] dive bombers on October 9, 1943. 

Reassigned to [[Fifteenth Air Force]] in November 1943, being assigned to Triolo Airfield, [[Italy]].  Engaged primarily in escort work  flying many missions to cover bombers engaged in long-range operations against strategic objectives in Italy, [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Rumania]], and [[Bulgaria]].   However, on occasion, they escorted the medium bombers of the Twelfth Air Force. 

On [[2 April]] [[1944]], the 14th Fighter Group earned a [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] for escorting bombers attacking ball-bearing and aircraft production facilities at [[Steyr]], Austria.

In late July and early August 1944, the 14th flew a shuttle missions to [[Russia]] and returned to their Italian base after spending three days at a Soviet base in the [[Ukraine]]. Along with their P-51 escorts, they shot down thirty German planes and destroyed twelve on the ground. The last Lightning shuttle mission was flown on August 4/6.

The group provided escort for reconnaissance operations, supported the [[Operation Dragoon|invasion of Southern France]] in Aug 1944, and on numerous occasions flew long-range missions to strafe and dive-bomb motor vehicles, trains, bridges, supply areas, airdromes, and troop concentrations in an area extending from France to the Balkans.

The 14th Fighter Group was inactivated in Italy on 9 Sep 1945.

====Air Defense Command====
Activated in the US on 20 Nov 1946 at [[Bangor International Airport|Dow Field]], [[Maine]] as part of [[Air Defense Command]]. it's 37th FIS waqs equipped first with [[P-47]]<U+2019>s and later with [[F-84]]<U+2019>s. Inactivated on 2 Oct 1949. Redesignated '''14th Fighter Group (Air Defense)'''. Reativated on 18 Aug 1955 at [[Burlington International Airport|Ethan Allen AFB]], [[Vermont]].   Assigned to Air Defense Command and equipped with [[F-86]] aircraft.  It's 37th FIS upgraded in 1958 to the [[F-102]] until being inactivated on 23 May 1960.

====Southeast Asia====
[[Image:14thsow.jpg|left|125px]]
The unit was redesignated as the '''14th Air Commando Wing''' and was reactivated at [[Nha Trang AB]] [[Republic of Vietnam]] on 8 March 1966. On 1 August 1968 it was renamed the '''14th Special Operations Wing''' and was the host unit at the base until 30 September 1971.  From 15 October 1969 through 30 September 1971 the 14th SOW also operated and conducted missions from [[Phan Rang Air Base]] Republic of Vietnm

Operations included [[Close air support|close]] and direct air support, interdiction, combat [[airlift]], aerial resupply, visual and photographic reconnaissance, [[unconventional warfare]], [[counterinsurgency]] operations, [[psychological warfare]] (including leaflet dropping and aerial [[broadcasting]]), [[forward air control]] operations and escort, [[search and rescue]], escort for convoy and [[defoliation]] operations, [[Flare (pyrotechnic)|flare]] drops, civic actions, and [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] actions.  

The 14th Air Commando Wing distinguished itself by extraordinary heroism, exceptional gallantry and outstanding performance of duty in action against hostile forces in Southeast Asia from 8 March 1966 to 7 March 1967, earning a [[Presidential Unit Citation]]. Flying thousands of widely diversified sorties, elements of the Wing caused many enemy casualties and destroyed or damaged more than 8,500 structures, 500 trucks and 60 fuel sites as well as numerous automatic weapon positions, radio stations, bridges and boats. 

Flying the venerable [[C-47]] aircraft, one squadron of the Wing helped abort a large number of night hostile operations against friendly forts and hamlets through flare drops and minigun saturation fire. Despite the often heavy and accurate enemy antiaircraft fire, the search and rescue missions of the Wing recovered 91 skilled airmen during this period. In addition, the Wing's psychological warfare missions directly or indirectly influenced the surrender of thousands of enemy soldiers. 

The wing also provided maintenance support for a number of tenants.  The wing trained [[Vietnam Air Force]] (VNAF) personnel in AC-119 operations and maintenance, February-August 1971, and transferred some of its A[[C-119]]s to the VNAF, August-September 1971 as part of a phase-down for inactivation.

====Air Training/Air Education and Training Command====
The 14th replaced, and absorbed resources of, the 3650th Pilot Training Wing in June 1972 at [[Columbus Air Force Base]], [[Mississippi]], and assumed an undergraduate pilot training program, plus base operations and maintenance.  From 1993 to 2000, the wing also trained pilots in fighter fundamentals, using AT-38 aircraft. Fighter fundamentals training at Columbus resumed on [[May 10]], [[2007]] with the reassignment of the 49th Fighter Training Squadron from Moody AFB. On [[27 January]] [[1995]], [[Second Lieutenant]] [[Kelly Flinn]] graduated from pilot training with the 14th Flying Training Wing on her way to becoming the first woman to enter [[B-52 Stratofortress]] combat crew training.
