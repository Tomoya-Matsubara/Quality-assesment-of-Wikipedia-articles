Sample lyrics:
Of all the schools in this fair land,
There's one whose name we praise.
We'll work for her,
We'll fight for her.
In everything we do.

Alum Mater, Alum Mater.
Hail, all hail to you.
Red and white stand for the light
of dear old SNU.

==The ''A Transforming Vision Campaign''==

SNU is now in the beginning of a campus renaissance. This is the first major change to the campus since 1988. There are four major aspects to the campaign: Marchant Center, Centennial Gates, Parker Center, and Science Hall renewal. In addition to the major four, SNU will go through a thorogh remodel and update of most of educational buildings. SNU also installed wireless network access in every campus building in the summer of 2006. Coinsiding with the unique feature of all incoming freshman at SNU receiving a new [[Apple Computer|Apple]] or [[Dell]] laptop computer. (The computer cost is built into the new student's tutition cost.) New campus art is supposed to appear throughout the campus as well.

An announcement of when the next phase of the campaign will begin has yet to be announced. Many smaller remodeling projects are currently underway.  

===The Marchant Family Alumni & Welcome Center===
Construction of the new Marchant Welcome and Alumni Center started in May 2004 and was deticated in November, 2005. The Marchant Center is also the home to the Office of Admissions since 2006. The Marchant center sits next to Bresee Hall, and faces 39th Expressway and Bethany's central commercial district. The 8,000 square foot center is the new "front door" for SNU. It also contains offices for Alumni Relations and artifacts from the Fred Floyd Archives. The cost for the Marchant Center was nearly $2 million. Made possible by over 1,000 donors. The Marchant Center was designed through an architectural partnership with Anthony McDermid of TAP architecture (building design) and Jerry Lester of Nicek & Lester (construction design).
This building marked the beginning of "A Transforming Vision <U+2013> The Campaign for Southern Nazarene University."

===Centennial Gates===
The newest addition to the campus is a pair of arches called the Centennial Gates. These gates are recognized by the Oklahoma Centennial Foundation and are one of the first to be dedicated in celebration of Oklahoma's 100th birthday. The gates were dedicated [[11 November]] [[2006]] during the university's 2006 Homecoming, and cost $250,000.

===Parker Center for the Performing Arts===
Also part of the campaign is the Parker Center for the Performing Arts, which will be a 1,500 seat auditorium space for art, music, and performing arts classes, as well as a studio. The location for the Parker Center will be adjacent to the Sawyer Center, the official practice site of the [[New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets]]. There will be additional parking created between the buildings with a two level parking garage. The cost of this project is approximately $14 million. A completion date has yet to be determined.

===Don W. Beaver Science Hall renaissance===
The renewal of the Don W. Beaver Science Hall has begun, starting with the interior of the building. However, the real changes begin with the expansion of the building in the lab annex and atrium. Ten academic departments are housed in the building and all will be enhanced by its renewal. The cost for this project is estimated at $6 million. There is no time table set for the completion of this project, but in late 2004 space was cleared for the annex.

===Royce Brown Business Building===
The Royce Brown Business Building underwent an extensive facelift in preparation for Homecoming 2006. Not officially a part of SNU's A Transforming Vision campaign, the improvements included new paint, new carpet, and new tiles, as well as comtemporary furniture and paintings. At Homecoming 2006, the School of Business revealed its new slogan, "Taking the mind of Christ into the world of business." The Memorial Fine Arts Hall, and the Don W. Beaver Science Building underwent a similar facelift during the 2006-07 year.

===Latest===
According to the latest campaign update in November 2006, the school has raised more than the initial estimated cost of $34 million for all projects. No construction has begun on any the remaining or unfinished projects.

===Criticism===

Many people have criticized the campaign's progress and lack of practicality for the current student body. Criticism has also been laid on the leadership of the campaign and alumni who give the money, mainly because alumni give gifts only to specific things instead of giving toward projects that would increase SNU's growth. It is not necessary for SNU to put up gates or an Almuni Center when the Science Department is aging in technology and space and scholarship money is draining. The Parker Center and Science Building Renaissance should have come first instead of the gates and Alumni Center. However, a look at SNU's financial statement will show money was given specifically for the Alumni Center and for the Centennial gates. If anyone is at fault for bad priorities, it is the alumni who have not given money towards the Parker Center. 

Also, the timeline has been stretched out. The Alumni Center was originally scheduled to open in Fall of 2004, but opened instead in the Fall of 2005. Additionally, the color of brick for the Marchant Center doesn't match any of the other buildings. The Parker Center was to open in 2010; now it is estimated that construction will start then. No word on when the Science Building will get updated. Also there are no improvements for the S.T. Ludwig Religion Building, or anything for the School of Kinesiology and Sports Management, the two largest majors SNU has to offer. New desks are not mentioned anywhere. The current deskes in use date back to before 1956, and are in major disrepair.

There have also been concerns about the lack-luster effort to remodel Snowbarger Hall. Three  out of five floors have been completely remodeled, with only 6-8 rooms remodeled on the remaining two floors. This project has been pushed to the back burners for several years. Renovations stopped in the summer of 2004. Although in 2006, the dorm lobby and laundry faclities have been improved. The two female dormitories' rooms have not been renovated. (Aesthetic features in Hatley Hall have been improved, such as new carpet in the halls and lobby, as well as new lobby features. Garey Hall, the twin dorm for Hatley, and Bracken Hall, for upperclassmen, still remain in disrepair.) 

When SNU can acquire funds for a quarter million dollar Centennial Gate, and not acquire funds for the more practical dorm remodels, it raises questions on the leadership of SNU, such as whether or not the administration is in touch with the needs of its students. Deteriorating campus housing, rising costs, and a lack of practical improvements in the Transforming Vision Campaign may have led to the temporary decrease in class sizes since 2004. The class sizes are not expected to rise again until all the improvements have been made.

==Spiritual development==
A unique dimension of community life is the emphasis on the holistic integration of faith, learning and living. Spiritual formation, therefore, pervades the work of the entire university community. Deep devotion to the principles of the Christian faith, high standards of excellence in learning, and great commitment to integrity in living are dynamically brought together on the SNU campus. These commitments translate into a supportive, caring environment where close friendships develop and where students and faculty can grow together within a transforming community.

Chapel services, which meet each Tuesday and Wednesday, form the cornerstone of spiritual development efforts at SNU. Students are exposed to a variety of speakers, encouraged to expand their worldview, challenged by the implications of their faith, and encouraged to attend and participate in weekly services at a local church in the Christian faith.

The Vice-President of Spiritual Development is Brad Strawn. Brad is following former VP of Spiritual Development Dee Kelley (1994-2006).

==Student government==
The Student Government Association of SNU is committed to providing quality events and services to the students of SNU at minial cost. SGA is broken up into five councils, Campus Ministries, Community Relations, Publicity, Social Life, and Student Services.
==The Arrow==
The Arrow is the annual publication of the yearbook. Edition of the the Arrow yearbook from 1927-2006 can be found in the [[Roy T. Williams|R. T. Williams]] Learning Resource Center. The first publications ('23-26) can be viewed upon special request from the librarian.

==The Echo==
The Echo is the weekly edition of the newspaper. The former title name for the newspaper was "The Reveille Echo".
