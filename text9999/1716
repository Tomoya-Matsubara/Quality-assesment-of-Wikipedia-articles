'''Pinnipeds''', often generalized as '''seals''',{{efn|This term typically excludes the walrus in everyday English.}} are a widely [[range (biology)|distributed]] and diverse [[clade]] of fin-footed, [[semiaquatic]] [[marine mammals]]. They comprise the [[extant taxon|extant]] [[family (biology)|families]] [[Odobenidae]] (whose only living member is the [[walrus]]), [[Otariidae]] (the eared seals: [[sea lion]]s and [[fur seal]]s), and [[Phocidae]] (the earless, or "true" seals). There are 33 extant species of pinnipeds, and more than 50 extinct species have been described from fossils. While seals were historically thought to have descended from two ancestral lines, [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] evidence supports them as a [[monophyletic]] lineage (descended from one ancestral line). Pinnipeds belong to the order [[Carnivora]] and their closest living relatives are [[bear]]s and [[Musteloidea|musteloid]]s.

Seals range in size from the {{convert|1|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|45|kg|abbr=on}} [[Baikal seal]] to the {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|3200|kg|abbr=on}} [[southern elephant seal]], which is also the largest carnivoran.{{efn|The term "carnivoran" refers to members of the order Carnivora. It is not to be confused with "carnivore" or "carnivorous", which refers to meat-eating animals in general.}} Several species exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]]. They have streamlined bodies and four limbs that are modified into [[Flipper (anatomy)|flipper]]s. Though not as fast in the water as [[dolphin]]s, seals are more flexible and agile. Otariids use their front limbs primarily to propel themselves through the water, while phocids and walruses use their hind limbs. Otariids and walruses have hind limbs that can be pulled under the body and used as legs on land. By comparison, terrestrial locomotion by phocids is more cumbersome. Otariids have visible external ears, while phocids and walruses lack these. Pinnipeds have well-developed senses<U+2014>their eyesight and hearing are adapted for both air and water, and they have an advanced [[somatosensory system|tactile system]] in their [[whiskers]] or vibrissae. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or [[blubber]], under the skin to keep warm in the cold water, and, other than the walrus, all species are covered in fur.

Although pinnipeds are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. They spend most of their lives in the water, but come ashore to mate, give birth, [[moulting|molt]] or escape from predators like [[shark]]s and [[killer whale]]s. They feed largely on fish and [[marine invertebrates]], but a few, like the [[leopard seal]], feed on large vertebrates such as [[penguin]]s and other seals. Walruses are specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling [[mollusk]]s. Male pinnipeds typically mate with more than one female ([[polygyny]]), although the degree of polygyny varies with the species. The males of land-breeding species tend to mate with a greater number of females than those of ice-breeding species. Male pinniped strategies for [[reproductive success]] vary between defending females, defending [[Territory (animal)|territories]] that attract females and performing [[Courtship display|ritual displays]] or [[lek mating]]. Pups are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species [[fasting|fast]] and nurse their young for a relatively short period of time while others take foraging trips at sea between nursing bouts. Walruses are known to nurse their young while at sea. Seals produce a number of [[animal communication|vocalizations]], notably the barks of [[California sea lion]]s, the [[gong]]-like calls of walruses and the complex songs of [[Weddell seal]]s.

The meat, blubber and fur coats of pinnipeds have traditionally been used by [[Circumpolar peoples|indigenous peoples of the Arctic]], and seals have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. They are commonly kept in captivity and are even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks. Once relentlessly [[seal hunting|hunted]] by commercial industries for their products, seals are now protected by international law. The [[Japanese sea lion]] and the [[Caribbean monk seal]] have become extinct in the past century, while the [[Mediterranean monk seal]] and [[Hawaiian monk seal]] are ranked [[Critically Endangered]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. Besides hunting, pinnipeds also face threats from [[bycatch|accidental trapping]], [[marine pollution]], and conflicts with local people.

German naturalist [[Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger]] was the first to recognize the pinnipeds as a distinct [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] unit, and in 1811 he gave the name Pinnipedia to both a [[Family (biology)|family]] and an order.<ref>Scheffer, [http://books.google.com/books?id=tG2mAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA52 p. 52.]</ref> American zoologist [[Joel Asaph Allen]] reviewed the world's pinnipeds in an 1880 [[monograph]], ''History of North American pinnipeds, a monograph of the walruses, sea-lions, sea-bears and seals of North America''.

Otariids are also known as eared seals due to the presence of [[Pinna (anatomy)|pinnae]]. These animals rely on their well-developed fore-flippers to propel themselves through the water. They can also turn their hind-flippers forward and "walk" on land.<ref name=Riedman64>Riedman, p. 64.</ref> The anterior end of an otariid's [[frontal bone]]s extends between the [[nasal bone]]s, and the [[supraorbital foramen]] is large and flat horizontally. The [[supraspinatous fossa]]s are divided by a "secondary spine" and the [[bronchi]] are divided anteriorly.<ref name="Berta"/> Otariids consist of two types: [[sea lion]]s and [[fur seal]]s. Sea lions are distinguished by their rounder snouts and shorter, rougher [[pelage]], while fur seals have more pointed snouts, longer fore-flippers and thicker fur coats that include an undercoat and guard hairs. The former also tend to be larger than the latter.<ref>Riedman, pp. 68<U+2013>70.</ref> Five [[genera]] and seven species (one now extinct) of sea lion are known to exist while two genera and nine species of fur seal exist. While sea lions and fur seals have historically been considered separate subfamilies (Otariinae and Arctocephalinae respectively), a 2001 genetic study found that the northern fur seal is more closely related to several sea lion species.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Wynen, L. P.; Goldsworthy, S. D.; Insley, S. J.; Adams, M.; Bickham, J. W.; Francis, J.; Gallo, J. P.; Hoelzel, A. R.; Majluf, P.; White, R.

Odobenidae consists of only one living member: the modern walrus. This animal is easily distinguished from other extant pinnipeds by its larger size (exceeded only by the [[elephant seals]]), nearly hairless skin and long upper [[Canine tooth|canines]], known as [[tusk]]s. Like otariids, walruses are capable of turning their hind-flippers forward and can walk on land. When moving in water, the walrus relies on its hind-flippers for locomotion, while its fore-flippers are used for steering. In addition, the walrus lacks external ear flaps.<ref>Riedman, pp. 82<U+2013>83.</ref> Walruses have [[pterygoid bone]]s that are broad and thick, frontal bones that are V-shaped at the anterior end and [[calcaneus]]es with pronounced tuberosity in the middle.<ref name="Berta"/>

Phocids are known as true or "earless" seals. These animals lack external ear flaps and are incapable of turning their hind-flippers forward, which makes them more cumbersome on land. In water, true seals swim by moving their hind-flippers and lower body from side to side.<ref name=Riedman64/> Phocids have [[Pachyostosis|thickened]] [[Mastoid process|mastoid]]s, enlarged [[Temporal_bone#In_other_animals|entotympanic bone]]s, everted [[pelvic bone]]s and massive [[ankle bone]]s. They also lack supraorbital processes on the frontal and have underdeveloped calcaneal tubers.<ref name="Berta"/> A 2006 molecular study supports the division of phocids into two monophyletic subfamilies: Monachinae, which consists of ''Mirounga'', ''[[Monachus]]'' and [[Lobodontini]]; and Phocinae, which includes ''[[Pusa]]'', ''[[Phoca]]'', ''[[Halichoerus]]'', ''[[Histriophoca]]'', ''[[Pagophilus]]'', ''[[Erignathus]]'' and ''[[Hooded seal|Cystophora]]''.<ref name="Arnason2006">{{Cite journal |author=Arnason, U.; Gullberg, A.; Janke, A.; Kullberg, M.; Lehman, N.; Petrov, E.

In a 2012 review of pinniped taxonomy, Bertha and Morgan Churchill suggest that, based on [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and genetic criteria, there are 33 [[extant taxon|extant]] species and 29 subspecies of pinnipeds, although five of the latter lack sufficient support to be conclusively considered subspecies. They recommend that the genus ''Arctocephalus'' be limited to ''[[Arctocephalus pusillus]]'', and they resurrected the name ''[[Arctophoca]]'' for several species and subspecies formerly placed in ''Arctocephalus''.<ref name="Berta 2012"/> More than 50 fossil species have been described.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dem<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>, T.

===Evolutionary history===
[[File:Puijila BW.jpg|thumb|right|Restoration of ''Puijila darwini'']]
Traditionally, pinnipeds were thought to be [[polyphyletic|diphyletic]] (descended from two ancestral lines), with walruses and otariids sharing a [[Most recent common ancestor|recent common ancestor]] with [[bear]]s and phocids sharing one with [[Musteloidea]]. However, morphological and molecular evidence support a [[monophyletic]] origin.<ref name="Berta">Berta, A.

Its teeth were adapted for [[Shearing (physics)|shearing]] (like terrestrial carnivorans), and it may have stayed near shore more often than its extant relatives. ''Enaliarctos'' was capable of swimming with both the fore-flippers and hind-flippers, but it may have been more specialized as a fore-flipper swimmer. A closer relative of extant pinnipeds was ''[[Pteroarctos]]'', which lived in [[Oregon]] 19<U+2013>15 mya.

The [[Lineage (evolution)|lineages]] of Otariidae and Odobenidae split almost 28&nbsp;mya.<ref name="Arnason2006"/> Otariids originated in the North Pacific. The earliest fossil ''[[Pithanotaria]]'', found in California, is dated to 11&nbsp;mya. The ''Callorhinus'' lineage split earlier at 16&nbsp;mya. ''[[Zalophus]]'', ''[[Eumetopias]]'' and ''[[Otaria]]'' diverged next, with the latter colonizing the coast of South America. Most of the other otariids diversified in the Southern Hemisphere.

These primitive walruses had much shorter canines and lived on a fish diet rather than a specialized mollusk diet like the modern walrus. Odobenids further diversified in the middle and [[late Miocene]]. Several species had enlarged upper and lower canines. The genera ''[[Valenictus]]'' and ''Odobenus'' developed elongated tusks. The lineage of the modern walrus may have spread from the North Pacific to the Caribbean (via the [[Central American Seaway]]) 8<U+2013>5&nbsp;mya and subsequently made it to the North Atlantic and returned to the North Pacific via the Arctic 1&nbsp;mya.

[[File:Southern Sea Lions.jpg|thumb|right|Male and female South American sea lions, showing sexual dimorphism]]
Almost all pinnipeds have fur coats, the exception being the walrus, which is only sparsely covered. Even some fully furred species (particularly sea lions) are more sparsely haired than most land mammals.<ref name=Riedman3>Riedman, p. 3.</ref> In species that live on ice, young pups have thicker coats than adults. The individual hairs on the coat, known collectively as [[lanugo]], can trap heat from sunlight and keep the pup warm.<ref name=Riedman16>Riedman, p. 16.</ref> Pinnipeds are typically [[Countershading|countershaded]], and are darker colored [[Dorsum (anatomy)|dorsally]] and lighter colored [[Abdomen|ventrally]], which serves to eliminate shadows caused by light shining over the ocean water.

It can constitute as much as 50% of a pinniped's body weight. Pups are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.<ref name=Riedman16/>

Pinnipeds have a simple stomach that is similar in structure to terrestrial carnivores. Most species have neither a [[cecum]] nor a clear demarcation between the [[small intestine|small]] and [[large intestine]]s; the large intestine is comparatively short and only slightly wider than the latter. Small intestine lengths range from 8 (California sea lion) to 25 times (elephant seal) the body length. The length of the intestine may be an adaptation to frequent deep diving, as the increased volume of the digestive tract serves as an extended storage compartment for partially digested food during submersion. Pinnipeds do not have an [[appendix (anatomy)|appendix]].<ref>Berta, Sumich, and Kovacs, p. 317.</ref> As in most marine mammals, the [[reniculate kidney|kidneys]] are divided into small lobes and can effectively absorb water and filter out salt.<ref name=Riedman31>Riedman, pp. 31<U+2013>32.</ref>

Pinnipeds can move around on land, though not as well as terrestrial animals.

===Senses===
[[File:Seals at Cape Cross, Namibia (3045707919).jpg|thumb|left|Frontal view of brown fur seal head]]
The eyes of pinnipeds are relatively large for their size and are positioned near the front of the head. One exception is the walrus, whose smaller eyes are located on the sides of its head.<ref name=Riedman43>Riedman, pp. 43<U+2013>45.</ref><ref name="Berta, p. 67">Berta, p. 67.</ref> This is because it feeds on immobile bottom dwelling mollusks and hence does not need acute vision.<ref name=Riedman43/> A seal's eye is adapted for seeing both underwater and in air. The [[lens (anatomy)|lens]] is mostly spherical, and much of the [[retina]] is [[equidistant]] from the lens center. The [[cornea]] has a flattened center where [[refraction]] is nearly equal in both water and air. Pinnipeds also have very muscular and vascularized [[iris (anatomy)|irises]]. The well-developed [[Iris dilator muscle|dilator muscle]] gives the animals a great range in [[Pupillary response|pupil dilation]]. When contracted, the pupil is typically pear-shaped, although the bearded seal's is more [[diagonal]]. In species that live in shallow water, such as harbor seals and California sea lions, dilation varies little, while the deep-diving elephant seals have much greater variation.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Mass, A.

===Diving adaptations===
[[File:Diving weddell seals.jpg|thumb|right|Diving [[Weddell seal]]s]]
Before diving, pinnipeds typically exhale to empty their lungs of half the air<ref name=Riedman25>Riedman, p. 25.</ref> and then close their nostrils and throat cartilages to protect the [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]].<ref>Berta, p. 69.</ref> Their unique lungs have airways that are highly reinforced with [[cartilage|cartilaginous rings]] and [[smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]], and [[alveoli]] that completely deflate during deeper dives.<ref>Berta, Sumich, and Kovacs, p. 240.</ref> While terrestrial mammals are generally unable to empty their lungs,<ref name="miller2006b">{{cite journal |author=Miller, N.

The trachea is flexible enough to collapse under pressure.<ref name=Riedman25/> During deep dives, any remaining air in their bodies is stored in the [[bronchioles]] and trachea, which prevents them from experiencing [[decompression sickness]], [[oxygen toxicity]] and [[nitrogen narcosis]]. In addition, seals can tolerate large amounts of [[lactic acid]], which reduces skeletal muscle fatigue during intense physical activity.<ref name="Costa">{{cite journal|author=Costa, D. P.|year=2007|title=Diving physiology of marine vertebrates|journal=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences|doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0004230|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/about/shortcourses/costa_divingphysiology2007.pdf|isbn=0-470-01617-5}}</ref>
 
The main adaptations of the pinniped [[circulatory system]] for diving are the enlargement and increased complexity of veins to increase their capacity. The [[retia mirabilia]] form blocks of tissue on the inner wall of the [[thoracic cavity]] and the body periphery. These tissue masses, which contain extensive contorted spirals of arteries and thin-walled veins, act as blood reservoirs that increase oxygen stores for use during diving.<ref name="Berta et al. p.241"/> As with other diving mammals, pinnipeds have high amounts of [[hemoglobin]] and [[myoglobin]] stored in their blood and muscles. This allows them to stay submerged for long periods of time while still having enough oxygen. Deep-diving species such as elephant seals have [[blood volume]]s that make up to 20% of their body weight. When diving, they reduce their heart rate and maintain blood flow only to the heart, brain and lungs. To keep their [[blood pressure]] stable, phocids have an elastic [[aorta]] that dissipates some energy of each heartbeat.<ref name="Costa"/>

===Thermoregulation===
[[File:N elephant seal resting.JPG|thumb|right|Northern elephant seal resting in water]]
Pinnipeds conserve heat with their large and compact body size, insulating blubber and fur, and high metabolism.<ref>Riedman, p. 14.</ref> In addition, the blood vessels in their flippers are adapted for [[countercurrent exchange]]. Veins containing cool blood from the body extremities surround arteries, which contain warm blood received from the core of the body. Heat from the arterial blood is transferred to the blood vessels, which then recirculate blood back to the core.<ref>Berta, p. 65.</ref> The same adaptations that conserve heat while in water tend to inhibit heat loss when out of water. To counteract overheating, many species cool off by flipping sand onto their backs, adding a layer of cool, damp sand that enhances heat loss. The northern fur seal [[wikt:pant|pants]] to help stay cool, while monk seals often dig holes in the sand to expose cooler layers to rest in.<ref>Berta, Sumich, and Kovacs, p. 220.</ref>

===Sleep===
Pinnipeds spend many months at a time at sea, so they must sleep in the water. Scientists have recorded them sleeping for minutes at a time while slowing drifting downward in a belly-up orientation. Like other marine mammals, seals sleep in water with [[Unihemispheric slow-wave sleep|half of their brain awake]] so that they can detect and escape from predators.<ref name=sleep/> When they are asleep on land, both sides of their brain go into sleep mode.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Lapierre, J.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Noaa-walrus22.jpg|thumb|right|Walrus on ice off Alaska. This species has a  discontinuous distribution around the [[Arctic Circle]].]]

As a whole, pinnipeds can be found in a variety of aquatic habitats including [[coastal]] water, [[open ocean]], [[brackish water]] and even freshwater [[lake]]s and [[river]]s. Most species inhabit coastal areas, though some travel offshore and feed in deep waters off [[oceanic island]]s. The Baikal seal is the only freshwater species, though some ringed seals live in freshwater lakes in Russia close to the [[Baltic sea]]. In addition, harbor seals may visit [[Estuary|estuaries]], lakes and rivers and sometimes stay as long as a year. Other species known to enter freshwater include California sea lions and South American sea lions.<ref>Riedman, pp. 94<U+2013>95.</ref> Pinnipeds also use a number of terrestrial habitats and [[substrate (biology)|substrates]], both continental and island. In temperate and tropical areas, they [[hauling-out|haul-out]] on sandy and [[pebble]] beaches, [[rocky shore]]s, [[shoal]]s, [[mud flat]]s, [[tide pool]]s and in [[sea cave]]s. Some species also rest on man-made structures like [[pier]]s, [[Jetty|jettie]]s, [[buoy]]s and [[oil platform]]s. Pinnipeds may move further inland and rest in sand dunes or vegetation, and may even climb cliffs.<ref>Riedman, p. 96.</ref> Polar-living species haul-out on either [[fast ice]] or [[sea ice|pack ice]].<ref>Riedman, p. 99.</ref>

==Behavior and life history==
[[File:Phoca vitulina (Habor Seal), Point Lobos, CA, US - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|Harbor seal hauled out on rock]]
Pinnipeds have an amphibious lifestyle; they spend most of their lives in the water but haul-out to mate, raise young, molt, rest, [[thermoregulation|thermoregulate]] or escape from aquatic predators. Several species are known to [[Animal migration|migrate]] vast distances, particularly in response to extreme environmental changes like [[El Ni<U+00F1>o]] or changes in ice cover. [[Elephant seal]]s stay at sea 8<U+2013>10 months a year and migrate between breeding and molting sites. The northern elephant seal has the longest recorded migration distance of any mammal, at {{convert|18000|<U+2013>|21000|km|abbr=on}}. Phocids tend to migrate more than otariids.<ref>Forcada, J. "Distribution", pp. 316<U+2013>21 in Perrin, W<U+00FC>rsig and Thewissen (2009)</ref> Travelling seals may use various features of their environment to reach their destination including [[Earth's magnetic field|geomagnetic fields]], water and wind currents, the position of the sun and moon and the taste and temperature of the water.<ref>Riedman, pp. 256<U+2013>57.</ref> 

Pinnipeds may dive during foraging or to avoid predators. When foraging, Weddell seals typically dive for less than 15 minutes to depths of around {{convert|400|m|abbr=on}} but can dive for as long as 73 minutes and to depths of up to {{convert|600|m|abbr=on}}. Northern elephant seals commonly dive {{convert|350|<U+2013>|650|m|abbr=on}} for as long as 20 minutes. They can also dive {{convert|1259|<U+2013>|4100|m|abbr=on}} and for as long as 62 minutes. The dives of otariids tend to be shorter and less deep. They typically last 5<U+2013>7 minutes with average depths to {{convert|30|<U+2013>|45|m|abbr=on}}. However, the New Zealand sea lion has been recorded diving to a maximum of {{convert|460|m|abbr=on}} and a duration of 12 minutes.<ref>Riedman, pp. 172<U+2013>75.</ref> Walruses do not often dive very deep, as they feed in shallow water.<ref>Berta, p. 70.</ref>

Pinnipeds have lifespans averaging 25<U+2013>30 years. Females usually live longer, as males tend to fight and often die before reaching maturity.<ref>Berta, p. 78.</ref> The longest recorded lifespans include 43 years for a wild female ringed seal and 46 years for a wild female grey seal.<ref>Riedman, p. 242.</ref> The age at which a pinniped sexually matures can vary from 2<U+2013>12 years depending on the species. Females typically mature earlier than males.<ref>Riedman, pp. 234<U+2013>37.</ref>

===Foraging and predation===
[[File:Sea lion and Sturgeon.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Steller sea lion with [[white sturgeon]]]]
All pinnipeds are [[carnivorous]] and [[predatory]]. As a whole, they mostly feed on fish and [[cephalopod]]s, followed by [[crustacean]]s and [[bivalve]]s, and then [[zooplankton]] and [[endotherm]]ic  ("warm-blooded") prey like [[sea bird]]s.<ref>Riedman, pp. 144<U+2013>45.</ref> While most species are [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]] and opportunistic feeders, a few are specialists. Examples include the crabeater seal, which primarily eats [[krill]], the ringed seal, which eats mainly crustaceans, the Ross seal and southern elephant seal, which specialize on squid, and the bearded seal and walrus, which feed on [[clam]]s and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates.<ref name="MacDonald"/> Pinnipeds may hunt solitarily or cooperatively. The former behavior is typical when hunting non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, bays and rivers. An exception to this is the northern elephant seal, which feeds on fish at great depths in the open ocean. In addition, walruses feed solitarily but are often near other walruses in small or large groups that may surface and dive in unison. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds such as certain otariids hunt cooperatively in large groups. Some species, such as California and South American sea lions, may forage with cetaceans and sea birds.<ref>Riedman, pp. 166<U+2013>68.</ref> Seals typically consume their prey underwater where it is swallowed whole. Prey that is too large or awkward is taken to the surface to be torn apart.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Roffe, T. J.; Mate, B.

[[File:Fish8426 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|right|thumb|Leopard seal capturing [[emperor penguin]]]]
Pinnipeds themselves are subject to predation. Most species are preyed on by the [[killer whale]] or orca. To subdue and kill seals, orcas continuously ram them with their heads, slap them with their tails and fling them in the air. They are typically hunted by groups of 10 or fewer whales, but they are occasionally hunted by larger groups or by lone individuals. Pups are more commonly taken by orcas, but adults can be targeted as well. Large [[shark]]s are another major predator of pinnipeds<U+2014>usually the [[great white shark]] but also the [[tiger shark]] and [[mako shark]]. Sharks usually attack by ambushing them from below. The prey usually escapes, and seals are often seen with shark-inflicted wounds. Otariids typically have injuries in the hindquarters, while phocids usually have injuries on the forequarters.<ref name=predation/> Pinnipeds are also targeted by terrestrial predators. The [[polar bear]] is well adapted for hunting Arctic seals and walruses, particularly pups. Bears are known to use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Other terrestrial predators include [[cougar]]s, [[brown hyena]]s and various species of [[canid]]s, which mostly target the young.<ref name=predation>Weller, D. W.

Interspecific predation among pinnipeds does occur. The leopard seal is known to prey on numerous other species, especially the crabeater seal. Leopard seals typically target crabeater pups, which form an important part of their diet from November to January. Older crabeater seals commonly bear scars from failed leopard seal attacks; a 1977 study found that 75% of a sample of 85 individual crabeaters had these scars.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Siniff, D. B.; Bengtson, J. L.|year=1977|title=Observations and hypotheses concerning the interactions among crabeater seals, leopard seals, and killer whales|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|volume=58|issue=3|pages=414<U+2013>16|jstor=1379341|doi=10.2307/1379341}}</ref> Walruses, despite being specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, occasionally prey on Arctic seals. They kill their prey with their long tusks and eat their blubber and skin. Steller sea lions have been recorded eating the pups of harbor seals, northern fur seals and California sea lions. New Zealand sea lions feed on pups of some fur seal species, and the South American sea lion may prey on [[South American fur seal]]s.<ref name=predation/>

===Reproductive behavior===

[[File:Callorhinus ursinus and harem.jpg|thumb|right|Northern fur seal breeding colony]]
The [[mating system]] of pinnipeds varies from extreme polygyny to [[serial monogamy]].<ref>Riedman, p. 176.</ref> Of the 33 species, 20 breed on land, and the remaining 13 breed on ice.<ref>{{cite book |author=Cappozzo, H. L. |chapter=New perspectives on the behavioural ecology of pinnipeds |title=Marine Mammals: Biology and Conservation |year=2001 |editor-last=Evans, P. G.; Raga, J. A. (eds.) |publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers |page=243 |isbn=978-0-306-46573-4}}</ref> Species that breed on land are usually polygynous, as females gather in large aggregations and males are able to mate with them as well as defend them from rivals. Polygynous species include elephant seals, grey seals and most otariids.<ref name=dimorphism/> Land-breeding pinnipeds tend to mate on islands where there are fewer terrestrial predators. Few islands are favorable for breeding, and those that are tend to be crowded. Since the land they breed on is fixed, females return to the same sites for many years. The males arrive earlier in the season and wait for them. The males stay on land and try to mate with as many females as they can; some of them will even fast. If a male leaves the beach to feed, he will likely lose mating opportunities and his dominance.<ref>Riedman, pp. 178<U+2013>79.</ref> Polygynous species also tend to be extremely sexual dimorphic in favor of males. This dimorphism manifests itself in larger chests and necks, longer canines and denser fur<U+2014>all traits that help males in fights for females. Increased body weight in males increases the length of time they can fast due to the ample energy reserves stored in the blubber.<ref name=dimorphism/>

Other seals, like the walrus and most phocids, mate on ice or in the water.<ref name=dimorphism/><ref name=Riedman184>Riedman, pp. 184<U+2013>88.</ref> Females of these species tend to aggregate less. In addition, since ice is less stable then solid land, breeding sites change location each year, and males are unable to predict where females will stay during the breeding season. Hence polygyny tends to be weaker in ice-breeding species. An exception to this is the walrus, where females form dense aggregations perhaps due to their patchy food sources. Pinnipeds that breed on fast ice tend to cluster together more than those that breed on pack ice.<ref name=Riedman184/> Some of these species are serially monogamous, including the harp seal, crabeater seal and hooded seal.<ref name=Riedman196>Riedman, p. 196.</ref> Seals that breed on ice or in water tend to have little or no sexual dimorphism. In lobodontine seals, females are slightly longer than males. Walruses and hooded seals are unique among ice-breeding species in that they have pronounced sexual dimorphism in favor of males.<ref name=dimorphism/><ref name=Riedman184/>
[[File:Northern elephant seal combats.jpg|thumb|left|Male northern elephant seals fighting for dominance and females]]
Adult male pinnipeds have several strategies to ensure [[reproductive success]]. Otariids establish [[Territory (animal)|territories]] containing resources that attract females, such as shade, tide pools or access to water. Territorial boundaries are usually marked by natural breaks in the substrate,<ref name=mating>Mesnick, S. L.; Ralls, K. "Mating systems", pp. 712<U+2013>18 in Perrin, W<U+00FC>rsig and Thewissen (2009)</ref> and males defend their territorial boundaries with threatening vocalizations and postures, but physical fights are usually avoided.<ref name=aggressive>Campagna, C. "Aggressive behavior, intraspecific", pp. 18<U+2013>22 in Perrin, W<U+00FC>rsig and Thewissen (2009)</ref>  Individuals also return to the same territorial site each breeding season. In certain species, like the Steller sea lion and northern fur seal, a dominant male can maintain a territory for as long as 2<U+2013>3 months. Females can usually move freely between territories and males are unable to coerce them, but in some species such as the northern fur seal, South American sea lion and Australian sea lion, males can successfully contain females in their territories and prevent them from leaving. In some phocid species like the harbor seal, Weddell seal, harp seal and bearded seal, the males have underwater territories called "maritories" near female haul-out areas.<ref name=mating/> The maritories of Weddell seal males can overlap with female breathing holes.<ref name=Riedman184/> [[Lek mating|Lek systems]] are known to exist among some populations of walruses.<ref name=mating/> These males cluster around females and try to attract them with elaborate [[courtship display]]s and vocalizations.<ref name=mating/><ref name=Riedman212/> Lekking may also exist among California sea lions, South American fur seals and New Zealand sea lions. In some species, including elephant seals and grey seals, males will try to lay claim to the desired females and defend them from rivals.<ref name=mating/> Elephant seal males establish [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance hierarchies]] with the highest ranking males<U+2014>the [[Alpha (ethology)|alpha males]]<U+2014>maintaining [[Harem (zoology)|harems]] of as many as 50 females.<ref>Riedman, p. 204.</ref> Male harp seals, crabeater seals and hooded seals follow and defend lactating females in their vicinity and wait for them to reach estrus.<ref name=Riedman196/><ref name=mating/>

Younger or subdominant male pinnipeds may attempt to achieve reproductive success in other ways. Subadult elephants seals will sneak into female clusters and try to blend in by pulling in their noses. They also harass and attempt to mate with females that head out to the water. In otariid species like the South American and Australian sea lions, non-territorial subadults form "gangs" and cause chaos within the breeding rookeries to increase their chances of mating with females.<ref>Riedman, pp. 209<U+2013>10.</ref> Female pinnipeds do appear to have some choice in mates, particularly in lek-breeding species like the walrus, but also in elephant seals where the males try to dominate all the females that they want to mate with.<ref name=Riedman212>Riedman, pp. 212<U+2013>15.</ref> When a female elephant seal is mounted by an unwanted male, she tries to squirm and get away while croaking and slapping him with her tail.

===Birth and parenting===
With the exception of the walrus, which has five- to six-year-long inter-birth intervals, female pinnipeds enter [[estrous]] shortly after they give birth.<ref name=Berta76/> All species go through [[delayed implantation]], wherein the [[embryo]] remains in suspended development for weeks or months before it is implanted in the [[uterus]]. Delayed implantation postpones the birth of young until the female hauls-out on land or until conditions for birthing are favorable.<ref name=Berta76>Berta, pp. 76<U+2013>78.</ref><ref name=Riedman222>Riedman, pp. 222<U+2013>24.</ref> [[Gestation]] in seals (including delayed implantation) typically lasts a year.<ref name=Berta76/> For most species, birthing takes place in the spring and summer months.<ref>Riedman, p. 245.</ref> Typically, single pups are born;<ref name=Berta76/> twins are uncommon and have high mortality rates.<ref name=Riedman222/> Pups of most species are born [[precocial]].<ref name=Berta76/>
[[File:Harp seal mother and pup.jpg|thumb|right|Harp seal mother nursing pup]]
Mother pinnipeds have different strategies for maternal care and lactation. Phocids such as elephant seals, grey seals and hooded seals remain on land or ice and fast during their relatively short lactation period<U+2013>four days for the hooded seal and five weeks for elephant seals. The milk of these species consist of up to 60% [[fat]], allowing the young to grow fairly quickly. In particular, northern elephant seal pups gain {{convert|4|kg|0|abbr=on}} each day before they are weaned. Some pups may try to steal extra milk from other nursing mothers and gain weight more quickly than others. [[Alloparenting]] occurs in these fasting species;<ref name=Berta76/> while most northern elephant seal mothers nurse their own pups and reject nursings from alien pups, some do accept alien pups with their own.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Riedman, M. L.; Le Boeuf, B. J. |year=1982 |title=Mother-pup separation and adoption in northern elephant seals |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=203<U+2013>13 |jstor=4599535|doi=10.1007/BF00300063}}</ref>

For otariids and some phocids like the harbor seal, mothers fast and nurse their pups for a few days at a time. In between nursing bouts, the females leave their young onshore to forage at sea. These foraging trips may last anywhere between a day and two weeks, depending on the abundance of food and the distance of foraging sites. While their mothers are away, the pups will fast.<ref name=Berta76/> Lactation in otariids may last 6<U+2013>11 months; in the [[Gal<U+00E1>pagos fur seal]] it can last as long as 3 years. Pups of these species are weaned at lower weights than their phocid counterparts.<ref>Mann, J.

===Communication===
[[File:Noaa-walrus12.jpg|thumb|right|Walrus males are known to use vocalizations to attract mates.]]
Pinnipeds can produce a number of vocalizations such as barks, grunts, rasps, rattles, growls, creaks, warbles, trills, chirps, chugs, clicks and whistles. Vocals are produced both in air and underwater. Otariids are more vocal on land, while phocids are more vocal in water. Antarctic seals are more vocal on land than Arctic seals due to a lack of terrestrial predators like the polar bear.<ref name=communication>Dubzinski, K. M.; Thomas, J. A.; Gregg, J. D. "Communication in marine mammals", pp. 260<U+2013>68 in Perrin, W<U+00FC>rsig and Thewissen (2009)</ref> Male vocals are usually of lower frequencies than those of the females.<ref name=Riedman335/> Vocalizations are particularly important during the breeding seasons. Dominant male elephant seals advertise their status and threaten rivals with "clap-threats" and loud drum-like calls<ref name=Riedman327/> that may be [[Acoustic resonance|modified]] by the proboscis.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sanvito, S.; Galimberti, F.; Miller, E. H.|year=2007|title=Having a big nose: structure, ontogeny, and function of the elephant seal proboscis|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|volume=85|issue=2|pages=207<U+2013>20|doi=10.1139/z06-193|url=http://www.mun.ca/biology/tmiller/pdffiles/SANVITO_3541.pdf}}</ref> Male otariids have strong barks, growls, roars and "whickers". Male walruses are known to produce distinctive [[gong]]-like calls when attempting to attract females. They can also create somewhat musical sounds with their inflated throats.<ref name=Riedman327>Riedman, pp. 327<U+2013>30.</ref>

The Weddell seal has perhaps the most elaborate vocal repertoire with separate sounds for airborne and underwater contexts.<ref name=communication/> Underwater vocals include trills, chugs, chirps, chugs and knocks. The calls appear to contain prefixes and suffixes that serve to emphasize a message.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Terhune, J. M.; Healey, S. R.; Burton, H. R. |year=2001 |title=Easily measured call attributes can detect vocal differences between Weddell seals from two areas |journal=Bioacoustics |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=211<U+2013>22 |doi=10.1080/09524622.2001.9753463}}</ref> The underwater vocals of Weddell seals can last 70 seconds, which is long for a marine mammal call. Some calls have around seven rhythm patterns and are comparable to [[bird vocalization|birdsongs]] and [[whale vocalization|whalesongs]].<ref>Thomas, J. A.; Terhune, J. "Weddell seal ''Leptonychotes weddellii''", pp. 1217<U+2013>19 in Perrin, W<U+00FC>rsig and Thewissen (2009)</ref> In some species there appear to be geographic differences in vocalizations, known as [[dialect]]s,<ref>Riedman, p. 332.</ref> while certain species may even have individual variations in expression.<ref name=Riedman328>Riedman, pp. 328<U+2013>30.</ref> These differences are likely important for mothers and pups who need to remain in contact on crowded beaches. Otariid females and their young use [[contact call|mother-pup attraction calls]] to help them reunite when the mother returns from foraging at sea. Female pinnipeds are also known to bellow when protecting their young.<ref name=Riedman335>Riedman, p. 335.</ref>

While most vocals are audible to the human ear, a captive leopard seal was recorded making [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] calls underwater. In addition, the vocals of northern elephant seals may produce [[infrasonic]] vibrations. Non-vocal communication is not as common in pinnipeds as in cetaceans. Nevertheless, when disturbed by intruders harbor seals and Baikal seals may slap their fore-flippers against their bodies as warnings. Teeth chattering, hisses and exhalations are also made as aggressive warnings. Visual displays also occur: Weddell seals will make an S-shaped posture when patrolling under the ice, and Ross seals will display the stripes on their chests and teeth when approached.<ref name=communication/> Male hooded seals use their inflatable nasal membranes to display to and attract females.<ref name=Berta73/>

[[File:Walrus and Carpenter.jpg|thumb|right|Engraving of the "[[The Walrus and the Carpenter]]"]]
Various human cultures have depicted pinnipeds for millennia. The [[Celt]]s of [[Orkney]] and [[Hebrides]] believed in the [[selkie]]<U+2014>seals that could change into humans and walk on land. Seals are also of great importance in the [[Inuit culture|culture]] of the [[Inuit]]s.<ref name=Riedmanintro>Riedman p. xxi</ref> In [[Inuit mythology]], the goddess [[Sedna (mythology)|Sedna]] rules over the sea and marine animals.

===In captivity===
[[File:Kobe oji zoo 2009 April 22.jpg|thumb|right|Captive sea lion at [[Kobe Oji Zoo]], Japan]]
Pinnipeds have been kept in captivity since at least the 17th century and can be found in facilities around the world. Their large size and playfulness make them popular attractions. Some exhibits have rocky backgrounds with artificial haul-out sites and a pool, while others have pens with small rocky, elevated shelters where the animals can dive into their pools. More elaborate exhibits contain deep pools that can be viewed underwater with rock-mimicking cement as haul-out areas. The most common pinniped species kept in captivity is the California sea lion as it is abundant and easy to train.<ref name=zoo/> These animals are used to perform tricks and entertain visitors.<ref name="Walker 2003"/> Other species popularly kept in captivity include the grey seal and harbor seal. Larger animals like walruses and Steller sea lions are much less common.<ref name=zoo>{{cite book |author=Larson, S. |year=1999 |title=Encyclopedia of the World's Zoos |volume=3 |contribution=Seal and Sea lion |pages=1148<U+2013>50 |editor=Bell, C. E. (ed.) |isbn=978-1-57958-174-9}}</ref> Some organizations, such as the [[Humane Society of the United States]] and the [[World Society for the Protection of Animals]], object to keeping pinnipeds and other marine mammals in captivity. They state that the exhibits could not be large enough to house animals that have evolved to be migratory, and a pool could never replace the size and biodiversity of the ocean. They also oppose using sea lions for entertainment, claiming the tricks performed are "exaggerated variations of their natural behaviors" and distract the audience from the animal's unnatural environment.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Case Against Marine Mammals in Captivity |publisher=[[Humane Society of the United States]] and [[World Society for the Protection of Animals]] |pages=3, 18 |url=http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/marine_mammals/case_against_marine_captivity.pdf |accessdate=May 30, 2012}}</ref> 

California sea lions are used in [[Military animal|military applications]] by the [[U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program]], including detecting [[naval mine]]s and enemy divers. In the [[Persian Gulf]], the animals can swim behind divers approaching a U.S. naval ship and attach a [[Clamp (tool)|clamp]] with a rope to the diver's leg. Navy officials say the sea lions can do this in seconds, before the enemy realizes what happened.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-02-16-sealions-usat_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |title=Sea lions called to duty in Persian Gulf |author=Leinwand, D. |date=February 27, 2003 |accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref> Organizations like [[PETA]] believe that such operations put the animals in danger.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kreider, R.|date=May 31, 2011|title=The Real Navy Seals <U+2013> and Sea Lions and Dolphins and Whales|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=July 30, 2013|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/navy-sea-lions-dolphins-find-mines/story?id=13693585}}</ref> The Navy insists that the sea lions are removed once their mission is complete.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program|accessdate=July 30, 2013|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/spawar/Pacific/71500/Pages/faqs.aspx}}</ref>

===Conservation and management issues===
As of 2013, [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) recognizes 35 pinniped species. Two species<U+2014>the Japanese sea lion and the [[Caribbean monk seal]]<U+2014>are recently extinct, and ten more are considered at risk, as they are ranked "[[Critically Endangered]]" (the Mediterranean and Hawaiian monk seals), "[[Endangered species|Endangered]]" (Gal<U+00E1>pagos fur seal, Australian sea lion, Caspian seal and Gal<U+00E1>pagos sea lion), and "[[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]]" (northern fur seal, hooded seal and New Zealand sea lion).

[[File:Killing fur seals, St Paul Island.jpg|thumb|right|Men killing northern fur seals on [[Saint Paul Island (Alaska)|Saint Paul Island]], Alaska, in the 1890s]]
[[Seal hunting]] by humans has existed since the [[Stone Age]]. Originally, seals were hit with clubs during haul-out. Eventually, seal hunters used [[harpoon]]s to spear the animals from boats out at sea, and hooks for killing pups on ice or land. They were also trapped in nets. The use of firearms in seal hunting during the [[modern era]] drastically increased the number of killings. Pinnipeds are typically hunted for their meat and blubber. The skins of fur seals and phocids are made into [[Fur clothing|coats]], and the tusks of walruses continue to be used for carvings or as ornaments.<ref name=hunting>Reeves, R. "Hunting of marine mammals", pp. 585<U+2013>88 in Perrin, W<U+00FC>rsig and Thewissen (2009)</ref> There is a distinction between the subsistence hunting of seals by [[Circumpolar peoples|indigenous peoples of the Arctic]] and commercial hunting: subsistence hunters typically use seal products for themselves and depend on them for survival.<ref name=Riedman111>Riedman, pp. 111<U+2013>15.</ref> National and international authorities have given special treatment to aboriginal hunters since their methods of killing are seen as less destructive and wasteful. This distinction is being questioned as indigenous people are using more modern weaponry and mechanized transport to hunt with, and are selling seal products in the marketplace. Some anthropologists argue that the term "subsistence" should also apply to these cash-based exchanges as long as they take place within local production and consumption. More than 100,000 phocids (especially ringed seals) as well as around 10,000 walruses are harvested annually by native hunters.<ref name=hunting/> 
[[File:FoA protest.jpg|thumb|left|Protests of Canada's seal hunts]]
Commercial sealing was historically just as important an industry as [[whaling]]. Exploited species included harp seals, hooded seals, Caspian seals, elephant seals, walruses and all species of fur seal.<ref name=Riedman111/> The scale of seal harvesting decreased substantially after the 1960s,<ref name=hunting/> after the Canadian government reduced the length of the hunting season and implemented measures to protect adult females.<ref name="Beckman 2012">{{cite book |author=Beckman D.

The northern elephant seal was hunted to near extinction in the late 19th century, with only a small population remaining on [[Guadalupe Island]]. It has since recolonized much of its historic range but has a [[population bottleneck]].<ref name=Riedman111/> Conversely, the Mediterranean monk seal was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the Mediterranean to the [[Black Sea]] and northwest Africa, and remains only in the northeastern Mediterranean and some parts of northwest Africa.<ref>{{cite web|author=Johnson, W.

The [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals]] allows limited hunting of crabeater seals, leopard seals and Weddell seals. However, Weddell seal hunting is prohibited between September and February if the animal is over one year of age, to ensure breeding stocks are healthy. Other species protected are southern elephant seals, Ross seals and Antarctic fur seals.<ref name=Riedman111/> The Government of Canada permits the hunting of harp seals. This has been met with controversy and debate. Proponents of seal hunts insist that the animals are killed humanely and the white-coated pups are not taken, while opponents argue that it is irresponsible to kill harp seals as they are already threatened by declining habitat.<ref>{{cite web|author=Noronha, C.|date=April 4, 2010|title=Canada's harp seal hunt kicks off|publisher=NBCnews.com|accessdate=August 15, 2013|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/36287113/ns/world_news-world_environment/t/canadas-harp-seal-hunt-kicks/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Gillies, R.|date=March 23, 2009|title=Canada Seal Hunt Begins Amid Controversy|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=August 15, 2013|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/23/canada-seal-hunt-begins-a_n_178135.html}}</ref>

The Caribbean monk seal was killed and exploited by Europeans settlers and their descendants since 1494, starting with [[Christopher Columbus]] himself. The seals were easy targets for organized sealers, fishermen, [[turtling (hunting)|turtle hunters]] and [[buccaneer]]s because they evolved with little pressure from terrestrial predators and were thus "genetically tame". In the [[Bahamas]], as many as 100 seals were slaughtered in one night. In the mid-nineteenth century, the species was thought to have gone extinct until a small colony was found near the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]] in 1886. Seal killings continued, and the last reliable report of the animal alive was in 1952. The IUCN declared it extinct in 1996.<ref>Duffield, D. A.

Some species have become so numerous that they conflict with local people. In the United States, pinnipeds and other marine mammals are protected under the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972]] (MMPA). Since that year, California sea lion populations have risen to 250,000. These animals began exploiting more man-made environments like docks for haul-out sites. Many docks are not designed to withstand the weight of several resting sea lions, which causes major tilting and other problems. Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals, and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better withstand them.<ref>{{cite web|author=French, C.|date=April 10, 2013|title=Sea lions take over Ventura docks|publisher=the Log.com|accessdate=August 17, 2013|url=http://www.thelog.com/Local/Article/Sea-Lions-Take-Over-Ventura-Docks}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Bruscas, A.|date=July 27, 2012|title=Shocking new idea for sea lion control|publisher=The Daily World.com|accessdate=August 17, 2013|url=http://thedailyworld.com/sections/news/local/shocking-new-idea-sea-lion-control.html}}</ref> Sea lions also conflict with fisherman since both depend on the same fish stocks.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sheets, B.|date=February 3, 2012|title=As sea lion populations grow, conflicts increase|publisher=Herlad Net|accessdate=August 17, 2013|url=http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20120203/NEWS01/702029790}}</ref> In 2007, MMPA was amended to permit the lethal removal of sea lions from [[salmon run]]s at [[Bonneville Dam]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Endangered Salmon Predation Prevention Act |publisher=Northwest Regional Office, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |date=26 July 2012 |accessdate=9 June 2012 |url=http://www.nwr.noaa.gov/Marine-Mammals/Seals-and-Sea-Lions/Predation-Prevention-Act.cfm}}</ref> The 2007 law seeks to relieve pressure on the crashing [[Oncorhynchus|Pacific Northwest salmon]] populations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lethal Removal of Sea Lions Necessary to Ensure Survival of Endangered Salmon Populations in Pacific Northwest |publisher=[[United States House Committee on Natural Resources]] |date=14 June 2011 |accessdate=9 June 2012 |url=http://naturalresources.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=246431}}</ref> Wildlife officials have unsuccessfully attempted to ward off the sea lions using [[bomb]]s, [[rubber bullet]]s and [[Bean bag round|bean bags]].<ref name=warrant/> Efforts to chase sea lions away from the area have also proven ineffective.<ref>{{cite web |title=Columbia River Sea Lion Management: Restoring balance between predators and salmon |publisher=Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife |url=http://wdfw.wa.gov/conservation/sealions/ |accessdate=23 May 2012}}</ref> Critics like the Humane Society object to the killing of the sea lions, claiming that [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dams]] pose a greater threat to the salmon.<ref name=warrant>{{cite web |author=Haight, A. |date=9 March 2010 |title=Sea lion death warrants |publisher=[[KATU]] |accessdate=9 June 2012 |url=http://www.katu.com/outdoors/featured/87172472.html}}</ref> Similar conflicts have existed in South Africa with brown fur seals. In the 1980s and 1990s, South African politicians and fisherman demanded that the fur seals be [[Culling|culled]], believing the animals competed with commercial fisheries. Scientific studies found that culling fur seals would actually have a negative effect on the fishing industry, and the culling option was dropped in 1993.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lavigne, D. |contribution=Marine mammals and fisheries: The role of science in the culling debate |page=41 |year=2003 |title=Marine Mammals: Fisheries, Tourism and Management Issues: Fisheries, Tourism and Management |editor=Gales, N.; Hindell, M.;  Kirkwood, R.

Pinnipeds can also be threatened by humans in more indirect ways. They are unintentionally caught in [[fishing net]]s by [[commercial fisheries]] and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. [[Gillnetting]] and [[Seine fishing|Seine netting]] is a significant cause of mortality in seals and other marine mammals. Species commonly entangled include California sea lions, Hawaiian monk seals, northern fur seals and brown fur seals.<ref name=Riedman111/> Pinnipeds are also affected by [[marine pollution]]. High levels of [[Persistent organic pollutant|organic chemical]]s accumulate in these animals since they are near the top of [[food chain]]s and have large reserves of blubber. Lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. These pollutants can cause [[gastrointestinal cancer]]s, decreased reproductivity and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases.<ref>{{cite web|author=Metchalfe, C.|date=February 23, 2012|title=Persistent organic pollutants in the marine food chain|publisher=United Nations University|url=http://unu.edu/publications/articles/persistent-organic-pollutants-in-the-marine-food-chain.html|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}</ref> Other man-made threats include [[habitat destruction]] by oil and gas exploitation as well as encroachment by boats.<ref name=Riedman111/>
