==Plot==
<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. -->
Two [[ocellaris clownfish]], Marlin and his wife Coral, are admiring their new home in the [[Great Barrier Reef]] and their clutch of eggs.  An [[Australian barracuda]] attacks them, leaving Marlin unconscious.  He wakes up to find Coral and all but one of the eggs missing.  Marlin names this last egg Nemo, a name that Coral liked.

Nemo develops a small right fin due to damage to his egg from the attack, which limits his swimming ability.  After Marlin embarrasses Nemo during a school field trip, Nemo sneaks away from the reef and is captured by scuba divers.  As the boat departs, one of the divers accidentally knocks his [[diving mask]] overboard.

While attempting to save Nemo, Marlin meets Dory, a good-hearted and optimistic [[Paracanthurus hepatus|regal blue tang]] with [[Anterograde amnesia|short-term memory loss]].  Marlin and Dory encounter three [[shark]]s: Bruce, Anchor and Chum.  Marlin discovers the diver's mask and notices an address written on it.  When he argues with Dory and accidentally gives her a nosebleed, the scent of blood causes Bruce to enter a [[feeding frenzy]].  Marlin and Dory escape from Bruce, but the mask falls into a trench in the [[deep sea]].

During a hazardous struggle with an [[anglerfish]] in the trench, Dory sees the diving mask and reads the address located in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].  After receiving directions to Sydney from a [[Shoaling and schooling|school]] of [[Silver moony|moonfish]], Marlin and Dory encounter a bloom of [[Chrysaora quinquecirrha|jellyfish]] that nearly kills them.  Marlin loses consciousness and wakes up to see a [[Green sea turtle|sea turtle]] named Crush, who takes Dory and him on the [[East Australian Current]].  Marlin shares the details of his journey with a group of young sea turtles, his story is spread across the ocean, and he finds Nemo in Sydney.

Nemo's captor - P. Sherman, a dentist - places him in a fish tank in his office on [[Sydney Harbour]].  Nemo meets aquarium fish called the Tank Gang, led by a [[moorish idol]] named Gill, who has a broken fin.  The Tank Gang includes Bloat, a [[Tetraodontidae|puffer fish]]; Bubbles, a [[yellow tang]]; Peach, an [[Pisaster ochraceus|ochre starfish]]; Gurgle, a [[royal gramma]]; Jacques, a [[Lysmata amboinensis|pacific cleaner shrimp]]; and Deb, a [[Dascyllus melanurus|blacktailed humbug]]. 

The fish learn that Sherman plans to give Nemo to his niece, Darla, who once killed a fish by constantly shaking its bag. Gill reveals his escape plan, which involves jamming the tank's [[Filter (aquarium)|filter]], forcing the dentist to remove the fish in order to clean it.  The fish would be placed in plastic bags, and they would roll out the window and into the harbor. After a [[brown pelican]] named Nigel brings news of Marlin's adventure, Nemo jams the filter, but the dentist installs a new high-tech filter.

Upon leaving the East Australian Current, Marlin and Dory are engulfed by a [[blue whale]].  Inside the whale's mouth, Dory communicates with the whale, which carries them to [[Port Jackson]] and expels them through his blowhole.  They are met by Nigel, who recognizes Marlin from the stories he has heard and takes them to the dentist's office.  Darla has arrived and the dentist is giving Nemo to her.  Nemo tries to play dead to save himself as Nigel arrives.  Marlin sees Nemo and believes he is dead.  Gill helps Nemo escape into a drain.

In despair, Marlin leaves Dory and begins swimming home. Dory loses her memory and becomes confused, but meets Nemo, who has reached the ocean.  Dory's memory is restored after she reads the word "Sydney" on a nearby drainpipe.  She guides Nemo to Marlin.  After they reunite, Dory is caught in a fishing net with a school of [[grouper]].  Nemo enters the net and directs the group to swim downward to break the net, enabling them to escape.  After returning home, Nemo leaves for school and Marlin, no longer overprotective, watches Nemo swim away with Dory at his side.

At the dentist's office, the high-tech filter breaks down and the Tank Gang escapes into the harbor, belatedly realizing they are still confined in the bags of water.

==Production==

The inspiration for Nemo sprang from multiple experiences,going back to when director [[Andrew Stanton]] was a child, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home.<ref name="commentary">Finding Nemo, 2004 DVD, commentary</ref> In 1992, shortly after his son was born, he and his family took a trip to [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]] (which was called Marine World at the time).  There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation.<ref>The Pixar Story by Leslie Iwerks, 2007 documentary</ref> Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park, but realized that he was over protecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.<ref name="commentary"/>

In an interview with [[National Geographic (magazine)|''National Geographic'' magazine]], he said that the idea for the characters of Marlin and Nemo came from a photograph of two clownfish peeking out of an [[Sea anemone|anemone]]:

{{Cquote|''It was so arresting. I had no idea what kind of fish they were, but I couldn't take my eyes off them. And as an entertainer, the fact that they were called clownfish<U+2014>it was perfect. There's almost nothing more appealing than these little fish that want to play peekaboo with you''.<ref>[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/01/clownfish/prosek-text Beautiful Friendship] ''National Geographic'' magazine, January 2010</ref>}}

In addition, clownfish are very colourful, but do not tend to come out of an anemone very often.  For a character who has to go on a dangerous journey, Stanton felt a clownfish was the perfect type of fish for the character.<ref name="commentary"/> Pre-production of the film began in early 1997.  Stanton began writing the screenplay during the post-production of ''[[A Bug's Life]]''.  As a result, ''Finding Nemo'' began production with a complete screenplay, something that co-director [[Lee Unkrich]] called "very unusual for an animated film".<ref name="commentary"/>  The artists took [[scuba diving]] lessons in order to study the coral reef.<ref name="commentary"/>

[[File:Pixar team 66<U+00E8>me Festival de Venise (Mostra) 2 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Andrew Stanton]] co-wrote and directed the film.]]
The idea for the initiation sequence came from a story conference between Andrew Stanton and [[Bob Peterson (animator)|Bob Peterson]] while they were driving to record the actors.  [[Ellen DeGeneres]] was cast after Stanton watched ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' with his wife and saw Ellen "change the subject five times before finishing one sentence".<ref name="commentary"/> The pelican character named Gerald (who in the final film ends up swallowing and choking on Marlin and Dory) was originally a friend of Nigel.  They were going to play against each other with Nigel being neat and [[wikt:fastidious|fastidious]] and Gerald being scruffy and sloppy.  The filmmakers could not find an appropriate scene for them that did not slow the pace of the picture, so Gerald's character was minimized.<ref name="commentary" />

Stanton himself provided the voice of Crush the sea turtle.  He originally did the voice for the film's [[Animatics|story reel]], and assumed they would find an actor later.  When Stanton's performance became popular in test screenings, he decided to keep his performance in the film.  He recorded all his dialogue while lying on a sofa in co-director Lee Unkrich's office.<ref name="commentary"/> Crush's son Squirt was voiced by Nicholas Bird, the young son of fellow Pixar director [[Brad Bird]].  According to Stanton, the elder Bird was playing a tape recording of his young son around the Pixar studios one day.  Stanton felt the voice was "this generation's [[Thumper (Bambi)|Thumper]]" and immediately cast Nicholas.<ref name="commentary"/>

[[Megan Mullally]] was originally going to provide a voice in the film.  According to Mullally, the producers were dissatisfied to learn that the voice of her character [[Karen Walker (Will & Grace)|Karen Walker]] on the television show ''[[Will & Grace]]'' was not her natural speaking voice.  The producers hired her anyway, and then strongly encouraged her to use her Karen Walker voice for the role.  When Mullally refused, she was dismissed.<ref>[http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/megan%20mullally%20dropped%20from%20finding%20nemo Megan Mullally <U+2013> Megan Mullally Dropped From Finding Nemo]</ref> To ensure that the movements of the fish in the film were believable, the animators took a crash course in fish biology and oceanography.  They visited aquariums, went diving in Hawaii and received in-house lectures from an [[ichthyologist]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Lovgren|first=Stefan|title=For Finding Nemo, Animators Dove Into Fish Study|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/05/0530_030530_findingnemo.html|work=National Geographic News|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}</ref>

===Environmental concerns and consequences===
The film's use of clownfish prompted mass purchase of the fish breed as pets in the United States, even though the story portrayed the use of fish as pets negatively and suggested that saltwater aquariums are notably tricky and expensive to maintain.<ref>{{cite news|first=Elizabeth|last=Jackson|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/busrpt/stories/s1000651.htm |title=Acquiring Nemo |publisher=The Business Report |date=November 29, 2002|accessdate=November 10, 2006}}</ref> The demand for clownfish was supplied by large-scale harvesting of tropical fish in regions like [[Vanuatu]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Mark|last=Corcoran|url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2004/s1239666.htm |title=Vanuatu <U+2013> Saving Nemo |publisher=ABC Foreign Correspondent |date=November 9, 2002|accessdate=October 23, 2006}}</ref> The [[Tourism Australia|Australian Tourism Commission]] (ATC) launched several marketing campaigns in China and the United States in order to improve tourism in Australia, many of them utilising ''Finding Nemo'' clips.<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-08/18/content_255968.htmTourism authorities hope ``Nemo" will lead Chinese tourists to Australia]</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Peter |last=Mitchell |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/06/03/1054406187273.html|title=Nemo-led recovery hope |work=The Age|location=Australia |date=November 3, 2002 |accessdate=October 23, 2006|location=Melbourne}}</ref> [[Queensland]] used ''Finding Nemo'' to draw tourists to promote its state for vacationers.<ref>{{cite news|first=Anthony |last=Dennis|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/11/1060588323028.html?from=storyrhs|title=Sydney ignores Nemo |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=February 11, 2003 |accessdate=October 23, 2006}}</ref>

The reaction to the film by the general public has led to environmental devastation for the clownfish, and has provoked an outcry from several environmental protection agencies, including the Marine Aquarium Council, Australia.  The demand for tropical fish skyrocketed after the film's release, causing reef species decimation in Vanuatu and many other reef areas.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.oceans.com.au/nemo-controversy.html | title=Marine Aquarium Council's request to "Leave Nemo in the Water"}}</ref> After seeing the film, although some aquarium owners released their pets into the ocean, they released them into the wrong ocean, which [[Invasive species|introduced species harmful]] to the indigenous environment and is harming reefs worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/finding-nemo-pets-harm-ocean-ecology-565398.html | title='Finding Nemo' pets harm ocean ecology | location=London |work=The Independent | first=Charles | last=Arthur |date=July 1, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dtmag.com/Stories/Ocean%20Science/10-04-feature.htm|title=Revealing Nemo's True Colors}}</ref>

Anderson-Lopez said that the couple agreed to write the adaptation of "one of their favorite movies of all time" after considering "the idea of people coming in [to see the musical] at 4, 5 or 6 and saying, 'I want to do that'....So we want to take it as seriously as we would a Broadway show".<ref name="orlando">{{cite news|last=Maupin |first=Elizabeth|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/orl-nemo2606nov26,0,5434834.story?page=1 |title=Swimming with big fish|publisher=Orlando Sentinel |date=November 26, 2006 |accessdate=March 22, 2007}}</ref> To condense the feature-length film to 30 minutes, she and Lopez focused on a single theme from the movie, the idea that "the world's dangerous and beautiful".<ref name="orlando"/>

In 2005, after disagreements between Disney's [[Michael Eisner]] and Pixar's [[Steve Jobs]] over the distribution of Pixar's films, Disney announced that they would be creating a new animation studio, [[Circle 7 Animation]], to make sequels to the seven Disney-owned Pixar films (which consisted of the films released between 1995 and 2006).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2005/08/08/655.aspx|title=The Skinny on Circle Seven|first=Jim|last=Hill|date=August 7, 2005|accessdate=March 27, 2012}}</ref> The studio had put ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' and ''[[Monsters University|Monsters, Inc. 2]]'' into development, and had hired screenwriter Laurie Craig to write a draft for ''Finding Nemo 2''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://animatedviews.com/2012/bob-hilgenberg-and-rob-muir-on-the-rise-and-fall-of-disneys-circle-7-animation/|title=Bob Hilgenberg and Rob Muir on the Rise and Fall of Disney<U+2019>s Circle 7 Animation|first=Josh|last=Armstrong|date=March 5, 2012|accessdate=March 27, 2012}}</ref> Circle 7 was subsequently shut down after [[Robert Iger]] replaced Eisner as CEO of Disney and arranged the acquisition of Pixar.

In July 2012, it was reported that [[Andrew Stanton]] was developing a sequel to ''Finding Nemo'', to be titled ''Finding Dory'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Finding Dory is coming to theaters November 2015.|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151384798655954&set=a.127564720953.105058.11784025953&type=1&theater|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=September 27, 2013|author=Disney|date=April 2, 2013}}</ref><ref name="sequel">{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/07/john-carter-helmer-andrew-stanton-dives-back-into-animation-with-finding-nemo-sequel|title=<U+2018>John Carter<U+2019> Helmer Andrew Stanton Dives Back Into Animation With <U+2018>Finding Nemo<U+2019> Sequel |publisher=Deadline.com |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref> with Victoria Strouse writing the script and scheduled to be released in 2016.<ref name="FN2">{{cite news|last=Kit|first=Borys|title=Andrew Stanton to Direct Pixar's 'Finding Nemo' Sequel|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/andrew-stanton-pixar-finding-nemo-sequel-350267|accessdate=July 17, 2012|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=July 17, 2012}}</ref> The same day the news of a potential sequel broke, director Andrew Stanton called into question the accuracy of these reports.

When that went away, everything slid up.  I know I'll be accused by more sarcastic people that it's a reaction to ''Carter'' not doing well, but only in its timing, but not in its conceit".<ref>{{cite news|last=Keegan|first=Rebecca|title=Director Andrew Stanton looks back on 'John Carter's' rocky path|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-john-carter-director-20120908,0,4090564,full.story|accessdate=September 8, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 8, 2012}}</ref> In February 2013, it was confirmed by the press that Albert Brooks would reprise the role of Marlin in the sequel.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fleming Jr.|first=Mike|title=Albert Brooks Hooks Deal To Reprise In <U+2018>Finding Nemo 2<U+2032>|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/02/albert-brooks-hooks-deal-to-reprise-in-finding-nemo-2/|accessdate=February 12, 2013|work=Deadline|date=February 12, 2013}}</ref>
