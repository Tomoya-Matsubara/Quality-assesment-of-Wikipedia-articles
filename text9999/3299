'''Makinti Napanangka''' ({{Circa}} 1930 <U+2013> 9 January 2011) was a [[Pintupi language|Pintupi]]-speaking Indigenous Australian artist from Australia's [[Western Desert cultural bloc|Western Desert]] region. She was referred to post-humously as Kumentje. <ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/aboriginal-desert-art-loses-unique-vision/story-e6frg6nf-1225986612458 |title=Aboriginal desert art loses unique vision |authors=Ashleigh Wilson| newspaper=The Australian|accessdate=2011-06-11|date=2011-01-13|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theaustralian.com.au%2Fnews%2Fnation%2Faboriginal-desert-art-loses-unique-vision%2Fstory-e6frg6nf-1225986612458&date=2012-10-11|archivedate=2012-10-11 }}</ref> The term Kumentje was used instead of her personal name as it is customary amongst many indigenous communities not to refer to the deceased by their original given name for some time after their death. <ref name="Dussart">{{cite journal|last=Dussart|first=Francoise-F.|year=1988|title=Notes on Warlpiri women's personal names|journal=Journal de la Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> des oc<U+00E9>anistes|volume=86|page=53|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/jso_0300-953x_1988_num_86_1_2842|accessdate=12 January 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.persee.fr%2FarticleAsPDF%2Fjso_0300-953x_1988_num_86_1_2842%2Farticle_jso_0300-953x_1988_num_86_1_2842.pdf&date=2012-08-26 |archivedate=27 August 2012}}</ref> She lived in the communities of [[Haasts Bluff]], [[Papunya]], and later at [[Kintore, Northern Territory|Kintore]], about {{convert|50|km}} north-east of the Lake MacDonald region where she was born, on the border of the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Western Australia]].

Makinti [[Australian Aboriginal kinship#Pintupi|Napanangka]] began painting [[Contemporary Indigenous Australian art]] at Kintore in the mid-1990s, encouraged by a community art project. Interest in her work developed quickly, and she is now represented in most significant Australian public art galleries, including the [[National Gallery of Australia]]. A finalist in the 2003 [[Clemenger Contemporary Art Award]], Makinti won the [[National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award]] in 2008. Her work was shown in the major Indigenous art exhibition ''Papunya Tula: Genesis and Genius'', at the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]].

Working in [[acrylic paint|synthetic polymer]] on [[linen]] or [[canvas]], Makintie's paintings primarily take as their subjects a rockhole site, Lupul, and an Indigenous story (or "[[Dreaming (spirituality)|dreaming]]") about two sisters, known as ''Kungka Kutjarra''. She was a member of the [[Papunya Tula]] Artists Cooperative, but her work has been described as more spontaneous than that of her fellow Papunya Tula artists.

Makinti was a member of the [[Pintupi]] group of Indigenous people,<ref name="NGVmain"/> who are associated with the communities of Papunya, Kintore, and [[Kiwirrkurra, Western Australia|Kiwirrkura]]. "Napanangka" is a [[skin name]], one of eight used to denote the subgroups in the [[Australian Aboriginal kinship#Pintupi|Pintupi kinship system]], not a surname in the sense used by Europeans.<ref name="CLC">{{cite web|url=http://www.clc.org.au/People_Culture/kinship/kinship.html|title=Kinship and skin names|work=People and culture|publisher=Central Land Council|accessdate=2009-10-23|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clc.org.au%2FPeople_Culture%2Fkinship%2Fkinship.html&date=2010-10-11|archivedate=2010-10-12}}</ref> Thus her personal name was "Makinti". The uncertainty around Makinti's date and place of birth arises from the fact that Indigenous Australians often estimate dates of birth by comparison with other events, especially for people born before contact with European Australians. They may also cite the place of birth as being where the mother first [[quickening|felt the foetus move]], rather than where the birth took place.<ref name="BirnbergIntro">{{cite book|last=Birnberg|first=Margo|coauthors=Janusz Kreczmanski|title=Aboriginal Artist Dictionary of Biographies: Australian Western, Central Desert and Kimberley Region|publisher=J.B.

Makinti's first contact with white people was seeing them riding camels, when she was living at Lupul.<ref name="Isaacs"/> She was one of a large group of people who walked into Haasts Bluff in the early 1940s, together with her husband Nyukuti Tjupurrula<ref name="NGVbio" /> (brother of artist [[Nosepeg Tjupurrula]]),<ref name="Genesis"/> and their son Ginger Tjakamarra, born around 1940.<ref name="Johnson"/> At Haasts Bluff they had a second child, Narrabri Narrapayi, in 1949.<ref name="Johnson"/> The population moved to Papunya in the late 1950s, where Makinti had another child, Jacqueline Daaru, in 1958. She had a daughter, Winnie Bernadette, in 1961 in Alice Springs.<ref name="Johnson"/> The family moved to Kintore when it was established in the early 1980s, and by 1996 Kumentje was painting there for the [[Papunya Tula]] Artists Cooperative.<ref name="Birnberg"/> Her children Ginger, Narrabri, and Jacqueline also became artists, all of them painting for Papunya Tula Artists.<ref name="Johnson"/>

== Artistic career ==
Artists of the Papunya Tula movement were painting at Haasts Bluff in the late 1970s, but the deaths of some of the main painters in the early 1980s led to a period of decline.<ref name="OCAAC">{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Vivien|title=The Oxford Companion to Aboriginal Art and Culture|editor=Kleinert, Sylvia and Margot Neale|page=219|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|chapter=Desert art|isbn=0-19-550649-9}}</ref> In 1992, the Ikuntji Women's Centre was opened at Haasts Bluff and a new painting movement quickly developed, supported by founding art coordinator Marina Strocchi,<ref name="McC-Haasts">{{cite book|last=McCulloch|first=Susan|title=Contemporary Aboriginal Art: A guide to the rebirth of an ancient culture|publisher=Allen & Unwin|location=St Leonards, NSW|year=1999|pages=103<U+2013>105|isbn=1-86448-631-7}}</ref> who assisted in artists' development at both Haasts Bluff and Kintore.<ref name="Japingka"/><ref name="McCulloch">{{cite book|last=McCulloch|first=Alan|coauthors=Susan McCulloch, Emily McCulloch Childs|title=The new McCulloch's encyclopedia of Australian art|page=117|publisher=Aus Art Editions in association with The Miegunyah Press|location=Fitzroy, VIC|year=2006|isbn=0-522-85317-X}}</ref> It was through this initiative that Kumentje began painting in the mid-1990s,<ref name="NGVbio"/> and by 1997 her work was being acquired by major collecting institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/colapp/pub/artworks/59799/details|title=Makinti Napanangka, ''Snake Dreaming'', 1996|year=1997|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|accessdate=2009-06-06 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ngv.vic.gov.au%2Fcolapp%2Fpub%2Fartworks%2F59799%2Fdetails&date=2010-10-18 |archivedate=2010-10-18 }}</ref> She was one of the "Kintore ladies"<ref name="Johnson"/> who joined earlier generations of the famous Papunya Tula artists,<ref name="Bardon">{{cite book|last=Bardon|first=Geoffrey|coauthors=James Bardon|title=Papunya&nbsp;<U+2013> A place made after the story: The beginnings of the Western Desert painting movement|publisher=Miegunyah Press|location=University of Melbourne|year=2004|isbn=0-522-85110-X}}</ref> and was referred to as "number one" by her fellow artists, amongst whom she was considered a leader.<ref name="Isaacs">{{cite journal|last=Isaacs|first=Jennifer|year=2006|title=Makinti Napanangka: under the desert sky|journal=Australian Art Collector|volume=37|pages=116<U+2013>123}}</ref> She painted with the Papunya Tula Artists Cooperative, in which she was a shareholder, from 1996.<ref name="Birnberg"/><ref name="PP08">{{cite web|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/nreta/publications/media/pdf/2008/08/20080815_makinti_statement.pdf|title=Statement on behalf of Makinti Napanangka by Papunya Tula Artists|last=Papunya Tula Artists|date=2008-08-25|publisher=Northern Territory Department of Natural Resources, Environment and The Arts|accessdate=2009-06-06 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nt.gov.au%2Fnreta%2Fpublications%2Fmedia%2Fpdf%2F2008%2F08%2F20080815_makinti_statement.pdf&date=2010-10-11 |archivedate=2010-10-12}}</ref>

Many paintings by artists of the Western Desert relate to water, while the story (or "[[Dreaming (spirituality)|dreaming]]") most frequently portrayed by Western Desert women is ''Kungka Kutjarra'', or Two Women, concerning the travel of two sisters.<ref name="McCulloch" /><ref name="Isaacs89">{{cite book|last=Isaacs|first=Jennifer|title=Australian Aboriginal paintings|publisher=Weldon Publishing|location=Sydney, NSW|year=1989|pages=9<U+2013>16|isbn=1-86302-011-X}}</ref> Makinti's works reflect those themes, and are particularly associated with a rockhole site, Lupul,<ref name="Clemenger"/><ref name="Territorian">{{cite news|url=http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2008/08/16/5246_darwinfestival.html|title=Winning painting 'singing' to judge|last=Langford|first=Ben|date=2008-08-16|work=Sunday Territorian|accessdate=2009-06-07 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ntnews.com.au%2Farticle%2F2008%2F08%2F16%2F5246_darwinfestival.html&date=2010-10-18 |archivedate=2010-10-18}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The site is sometimes referred to as Lupulnga, which in Pintupi is the [[absolutive]] case of Lupul.|group=notes}} and with ''Kungka Kutjarra''. Her untitled painting in the ''Genesis and Genius'' exhibition was based on ''Kungka Kutjarra'',<ref name="Genesis"/> while the painting that won the 2008 Telstra award related to Lupul. The [[iconography]] of her paintings includes the use of lines representing paths and ceremonial hair-string skirts, and circles representing water-holes.<ref name="McCulloch"/>

According to Art Gallery of New South Wales Indigenous art curator and NATSIAA judge Hetti Perkins, Makinti and her work are "very dynamic and charismatic".<ref name="ABC08"/> Although a member of the Papunya Tula Artists, Makinti's work has been described as taking "a more spontaneous approach in illustrating the traditional iconography than that done by previous artists painting at Papunya".<ref name="Birnberg"/> Her style evolved over time,<ref name="Rothwell07" /> beginning with gestural brush strokes in ordered compositions, and developing into more closely interwoven representations of the hair-string skirts and designs reflecting those used in body painting.<ref>{{cite book|last=Caruana|first=Wally|title=Important Aboriginal Art (auction catalogue)|editor=Sotheby's Australia|publisher=Sotheby's Australia|location=Melbourne|date=7 June 2011|pages=54|chapter=Makinti Napanangka}}</ref> Throughout this evolution, her colour palette has consistently included a subtle range of yellows and pinks, through to oranges and whites.<ref name="McCulloch" /><ref name="Rothwell07" /><ref name="Smee"/>

Judith Ryan, senior curator at the National Gallery of Victoria, described Makinti's entry in the 2003 Clemenger Contemporary Art Award as:<blockquote>concerned with touching and sensing with fingers, rather than purely visual. The repetition of colour chords and textured striations, which closely echo each other, has a rhapsodic effect akin to many bodies in dance and reveals the inner or spiritual power, the essence, of Makinti Napanagnka's country and cultural identity. The energetic lines invoke body paint for women<U+2019>s business, and more particularly represent spun hair-string, which is used to make belts worn by women during ceremonies associated with the rockhole site of Lupulnga, a [[Magpie-lark|Peewee]] Dreaming place.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Judith|chapter=Makinti Napanangka|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|location=Melbourne|year=2003|title=Clemenger Contemporary Art Award 2003: Exhibition Catalogue}}</ref></blockquote>

Reviewing the same exhibition, Robert Nelson described Kumentje's work as "sensual and chromatically effusive painting".<ref name="Nelson">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/23/1064082976419.html|title=Talents uncovered|last=Nelson|first=Robert|date=2003-09-24|work=The Age (Melbourne|accessdate=2009-10-13 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030925064725/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/23/1064082976419.html |archivedate=2003-09-25 }}</ref> The work of the "Kintore ladies" has created "some of the most richly textured surfaces in the history of the (Papunya Tula) company";<ref name="Johnson"/> Kumentje's painting for ''Genesis and Genius'' was hailed as "a painterly celebration of colour and form".<ref name="Genesis"/>
