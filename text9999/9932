The '''Bourse de Travail''' (fr:''labour exchanges''), a French form of the [[labour council]], were working class organizations that encouraged [[mutual aid]], education, and [[self-organization]] amongst their members in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

==Role==
===Labor===
Early [[French Third Republic|Third Republic France]] was a time of dramatic social and economic change. With the tremendous growth of industrial capitalism in the last twenty years of the 19th century and the continued migration of workers to cities, the traditional system of meeting places for those seeking work was overtaxed.  Skilled  and unskilled trades alike had gradually developed systems to match those seeking work with employers, but the legalization of trades unions in 1884, helped formalise these structures.  Employers, too, were creating private labor placement offices. <Ref>Casey Harison. The Rise And Decline Of A Revolutionary Space: Paris' Place De Greve And The Stonemasons Of Creuse, 1750-1900 - Critical Essay in the Journal of Social History: Winter 2000.</ref>  

The Republican government of Gambetta relied upon the support of working class voters, and so helped create the first Bourses du Travail under the control of newly legalised labor unions.  Socialist and radicals, elected to city offices in some areas, made the funding of Bourses du Travail a priority.  As the system expanded, radicals in local government extended aid.  The ''loi du 14 mars 1904'' mandated that every city of over ten thousand inhabitants had to create a ''bureau de placement'', establishing job offices and undercutting employer run placement agencies.  These government offices were usually placed in the local Bourses du Travail<ref>David Rappe,''La Bourse du travail de Lyon'', Lyon, Atelier de cr<U+00E9>ation libertaire, 2004.</ref>. 

With government support came government regulation. While there was no legal obligation for the state or the municipality to put in place these buildings, their construction helped both the [[workers' movement]] and [[domestic surveillance|surveillance]] of its activities. Business interests and the police saw the formalisation of Bourses du Travail as a way to channel the labor movement away from revolutionary change or to keep an eye on those who promoted it. 

===Role in Revolutionary Ideology===
The ideology behind the explosion in Bourses du Travail, popularized by revolutionary syndicalists like [[Fernand Pelloutier]], intended to create  in them the key organizational component of radical economic transformation.  By acting as future co-ordinating bodies, facilitating communication between ''sydicates'' (unions), the Bourse du Travail would co-ordinate production and consumption in the absence of both the state and the private ownership of the means of production. These institutions were central to the notion of [[Syndicalism|Revolutionary Syndicalism]] which dominated the [[Conf<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale du Travail]], France's largest labor federation in the first twenty years on the 20th century. Pelloutier and other revolutionary syndicalists argued that the Bourses -- small scale, local, self made -- were the guarantee that the CGT would remain both directly democratic and revolutionary. <ref>[http://www.pelloutier.net/dossiers/dossiers.php?id_dossier=193&idparent=190 David Berry. Anarchism, Syndicalism and the Bolshevik Challenge in France, 1918-1926 Part III : Syndicalism and the anarchist diaspora. 2006 on pelloutier.net]</ref>  They saw labor organizations as interconnecting in three ways: a national federation uniting each specific union (traditional craft or trade unions); a national federation of ''all'' unions (in this case, the CGT); and all local workers, across union and political boundaries, united in the Bourse du travail.  Supporters of the Bourse movement believed this structure last should become the most important form of workers'  association. <ref>For close examination of these tensions see:

*Kathryn E. Amdur.  Syndicalist Legacy. University of Illinois (1986) ISBN 0252012380 for how the federation of unions and the federation of single trades in fact triumphed in two towns in the period after WWI.</ref>

===Cultural===
The other major change of this period was the Republican promulgation of [[Laic laws]], taking education out of the hands of the [[Catholic church]], and eventually taxing and regulation Church institutions.  Bourses du Travail, like civil marriage or lay funerals, filled a communal role once played by local parishes. <Ref>See also on Wikipedia: [[1905 French law on the separation of Church and State]], [[La<U+00EF>cit<U+00E9>#France]], and [[Anti-clericalism#France]].</ref> 

Bourses du Travail were centers of working class culture.  Almost every one contained lending libraries, classrooms, meeting halls, and theaters.  Family and community celebrations took place here (away from the church), as did classes and political discussions, formal meetings and light entertainment.  The Bourses du Travail buildings are still often the place of theaters and concert venues.

==History==
===Birth in the Third Republic===
The idea of French labor exchanges far predates the institution.  In 1790, at the height of the [[French Revolution]], an abortive Bourse du Travail was established in Paris. The [[loi Le Chapelier]] of 1791 outlawed this and any other labor organization, and despite the brief legalization during the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], unions remained illegal until 1884. Adolphe Leullier presented in 1845 a similar project which he called the  ''Bureau central des ouvriers'', and in 1875, workers petitioned the Paris municipal council to establish a Bourse du Travail, which was rejected.  Labor organizations had existed underground or by other names, but their new status an explosion of radical activity.  The French Revolutionary tradition was evolving into the economic sphere of union organizing, rather than the seizure of power (exemplified by [[Auguste Blanqui]]). 

The first Bourse du Travail, in Paris, was begun in 1887. A building on [[rue JJ Rousseau]] was donated by the Socialist municipal council, and a second on [[rue du Ch<U+00E2>teau d<U+2019>eau]] was created in 1892.<ref> Both survive and operate as union and community centers today. See:

===''F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration des Bourses de travail'' and the CGT===
''See also [http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conf%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale_du_travail fr:Conf<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale du travail], [http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charte_d%27Amiens fr:Charter of Amiens] and [[Anarcho-syndicalism]]''

The ''F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration des Bourses de travail'' (Federation of Workers' Councils) was created in 1892 at the Congress of [[Saint-Etienne]] by [[Fernand Pelloutier]] to [[federate]] each city's workers' organization. It was first led by [[Bernard Resset]] (1892), then [[Rieu Cordier]], then Fernand Pelloutier (1895) and from 1901 to 1918 by [[Georges Yvetot]].  

The Federation of Workers' Council merged in 1895 with the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration nationale des syndicats]] (National Federation of Trade-Unions), which had been created in 1886, giving rise to the [[Conf<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale du travail]] (CGT), which was dominated by a [[Syndicalism|revolutionary syndicalist strategy]] until 1921. 

It was the FBT that, as much as any organization, created the CGT.  At their [[Nice]] congress in 1901 the f<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration des Bourses du Travail formally proposed the creation of and fusion with the CGT which took place in 1902. <Ref>[http://www.forez-info.com/encyclopedie/memoire_et_patrimoine/la_bourse_du_travail_de_saint-etienne.html La Bourse du travail de Saint-Etienne on forez-info.com.]</ref>

Many of the leaders of the Bourse du Travail went on to lead the CGT, and the FBT was a co-equal partner with individual unions in the CGTs founding.  Bourses have thus been called the ''m<U+00E8>re des syndicat'' (the mother of unions) for their role.<ref>Jean-Yves Martin.  Aux origines de la Bourse du Travail de St-Nazaire de 1892 <U+00E0> la fin du si<U+00E8>cle, in Cahier de l'AREMORS n<U+00B0>3 (1992)</ref>

Structurally, individual Bourses comprised the ''building'' itself (and its social, education, and other practical resources), and the Bourse as a council of local unions.  Unions paid a fee to join the bourse, though CGT affiliated unions were often exempted, and sent representatives to regular meetings of all the local unions. The administration of the bourse was by elected representatives.  Contrary to Pelloutier's vision, these representatives came from a variety of ideological backgrounds which both represented the local political leanings of unions, but also the wider political left in the area.  In many towns there were socialist municipal councils and mayors, either in [[Jules Guesde]]'s [[French Workers' Party]], the [[Jean Jaur<U+00E8>s|Jauresin]] [[Possibilism (French Socialist)|possibilists]] of the [[SFIO|Parti socialiste fran<U+00E7>ais]], or independent reformers of the [[Aristide Briand|Briand group]].  This leaves aside the constellation of syndicalist focused socialists (like [[Jean Allemane]]'s [[Revolutionary Socialist Workers' Party]]), cooperativists, and [[individualist anarchist]] workers who sometimes played active roles in their local Bourse.  In most places [[anarcho-syndicalism]] was but one small faction in both the bourses ''and'' the CGT, and so the bourses took on roles of a [[reformist]], or [[Marxist]], or strictly trade unionist character which presaged the CGT split.<ref> Kathryn E. Amdur, is especially good on teasing out the complexity and variation of this. See especially all of Chapter 2, pp57-64, pp. 126-133, and 196-198.</ref>

===Rise of the PCF and decline of the Bourse===
The birth of the [[French Communist Party]] began the decline of the Bourse du Travail movement. The CGT, which had regrouped the individual organizations, was swept up in the ideological tumult of the post war years.  It became, like much of the French left, dominated by the Communists ideological vision, which saw the loose federalism of Revolutionary Syndicalism as a reason for the failure of the 1918-1919 strike wave. In 1921, the CGT revised its structure, eliminating the local Bourses du Travail as constituent organization of the Union, and replacing them with a network of ''Unions Locales''. From here on, the CGT followed a British and American model of local trade specific unions, federated into a single national structure.<ref>[http://www.pelloutier.net/dossiers/dossiers.php?id_dossier=193&idparent=190 David Berry. Anarchism, Syndicalism and the Bolshevik Challenge in France, 1918-1926 Part III : Syndicalism and the anarchist diaspora. 2006 on pelloutier.net]
And for the United States echo of this process, see William E. Forbath. Not So Simple - labor politics of Sam Gompers in Labor History: May 1999. </ref> A split, eventually into three federations, created a [[SFIO]] dominated CGT, the [[United General Confederation of Labour]] (Conf<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale du travail - unitaire or CGTU), where communists cohabited with anarchists and revolutionary trade unionists, and the [[Revolutionary Trade Unionist General Confederation of Labour]] (Conf<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale du travail - syndicaliste r<U+00E9>volutionnaire or CGTSR) in 1923 when the communists gained control of the CGTU. (The CGT and CGTU reunited in 1936, and remained close to the [[French Communist Party]].)  Predictably, these often bitter party divisions in the labor movement made the local and inclusivist vision of the Bourses impossible.

The Bourses du Travail survived, often as a single organization union hall, while the history of splits in the French labor movement saw the buildings pass from one hand to another, revert to municipalities, or disappear entirely<ref>{{fr icon}} [http://www.ul-fo-lille.com/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=30 The Bourse in Lille,] for example passed to the [[Force Ouvri<U+00E8>re|Force Ouvriere union]], while  [http://www.bourse-troyes.ouvaton.org/ the Troyes Bourse was abandoned].</ref>.

==Today==
===Buildings and communities===
Bourse du Travail buildings and institutions remain in most large French cities.  Many are headquarters of the local unions which are federated into the [[Conf<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration nationale du travail]], or of other unions which split from the [[PCF]].   Many bourse were central as places of organizing and resistance during [[May 1968]]. In some places municipal governments have retained ownership, or community and radical groups have taken them over.  Some have simply been sold off for office space or torn down.  

In Lille, one of the earliest bourses remains as the home of five unions and a radical community center, and came center stage in the resistance to the deportation of [[undocumented immigrants]], when 460 ''sans-papiers'' staged a 30 day hunger strike to oppose government policies.<ref>[http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourse_du_travail_de_Lille French Wikipedia:Bourse du Travail de Lille]</ref>

===Ideology===
The Bourse du Travail concept has been central to [[Anarcho-syndicalism|Anarcho-syndicalists]] across the globe, and the model greatly influenced [[Council communism]] and other forms of [[left communism]].  Anarchists  of many stripes point to the Bourse du Travail as an example of a directly democratic, small scale federalist institutional structure.  

==Outside France==
The Bourse du Travail idea was exported along with [[French colonial empires|French imperialism]].  The FBT's full name was actually ''F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration des Bourses du Travail de France et des Colonies'', though in practice  this meant there were sections in the French [[Pied-noir|settler]] dominated parts of [[Algeria]].  These declined with their French counterparts, and did not survive the [[Algerian War|brutal anticolonial struggle]].<ref>Albert Ayache. Essai sur la vie syndicale en Algerie, l'annee du Centenaire (1930) in Le Mouvement social, No. 78, Special Issue: Le Mouvement Ouvrier Francais et l'Afrique du Nord. (Jan. - Mar., 1972), pp. 95-114</ref>

In Subsaharan Africa, Bourses du Travail were implanted in two ways.  In French controlled regions, labor unions were organized by the CGT in the 1930s and 1940s.  Their labour halls were styled Bourses du travail, some of which remain as centers of union activity.<ref>[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/35/200.html  Guy Bertrans Wonkam La gr<U+00E8>ve au Labogenie pr<U+00E9>occupe la Cstc in Le Quotidien Mutations (Yaound<U+00E9>), 16 December 2003], for current bourses in the [[Republic of Cameroon]].</ref>

The rulers of [[Belgian Congo]] created a Bourse du travail at [[Katanga]] in 1910 as a state controlled hiring hall, in an attempt to lure labor to areas of planned industrial (mostly mining) concentration.  Attempts by local officials to recast this cynically created employment agency into a more worker run operation suggest that the idea of a Bourse du travail never lost its syndicalist connotations.<ref>
<blockquote>''When Buttgenbach, managing director of the UMHK, proposed the creation of the BTK to the colonial minister Renkin, the minister promptly called an assembly of the major employers in Katanga, resulting in the creation, as a private enterprise, of the Bourse in July 1910. However, the administration's views on the functioning of the institution were inconsistent with the view of the BTK as a monopolistic, state-run and coercive labour bureau.''</blockquote><br />
