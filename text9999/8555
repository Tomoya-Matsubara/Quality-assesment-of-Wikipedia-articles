'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed; the house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'' but, despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13<U+2013>14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47<U+2013>48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.<ref name="PrestonChronicle"/> It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13<U+2013>14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47<U+2013>48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47<U+2013>48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47<U+2013>48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire.

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.<ref name="Guardian"/> Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13<U+2013>14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|"Demdike" is derived from "devil woman", suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was "feared and loathed within the community".{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.<ref name="Executions"/> As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after refusing to sell Alizon some pins, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both Alizon and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after interrogating Alizon Device's "mentally sub-normal" brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16<U+2013>18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the "melancholy associations" of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13<U+2013>14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix<U+2013>l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being "in the north of Colne",{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.<ref name="OS"/> The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47<U+2013>48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265<U+2013>266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is "persuasive" evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47<U+2013>48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.<ref name="MalkinTower"/>{{-}}
