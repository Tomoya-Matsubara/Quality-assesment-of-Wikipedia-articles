The first [[Women's Boat Race]] took place in 1927, but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s.  The race is conducted as part of the [[Henley Boat Races]], but in 2015 is slated to be held on the River Thames.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/women/history | title = A brief history of the Women's Boat Race | publisher = The Boat Race Company Ltd| accessdate = 5 July 2014}}</ref>  The reserve race, contested between Oxford's Isis boat and Cambridge's Goldie boat has been held since 1965.  It usually takes place on the Tideway, prior to the main Boat Race.<ref name=results/>

The race was umpired by former Cambridge [[Blue (university sport)|Blue]] Mike Sweeney, his fourth appearance in the role.<ref name=pull>{{Cite news | title = Time to pull in the same direction | first = David | last = Miller | work = [[The Times]] | date = 31 March 1990 | page=47 | issue =63668}}</ref>  He had advised the coxes that he would not be afraid to disqualify either crew should he need to: "If I warn them, it's irrelevant what their opinion is.  If they respond, fine.  If not, they're in trouble."<ref name=pull/>  The race was sponsored by [[Beefeater Gin]] who, prior to the race, had signed a three-year contract to continue their involvement in the race, worth <U+00A3>250,000.<ref name=pull/>  The BBC also extended their deal with a new five-year contract to broadcast the race in the United Kingdom.<ref name=pull/>

Cambridge were underdogs for the race, having lost all but one of the previous fourteen Boat Races.<ref name=aims>{{Cite news | title = Lightweight crew aims for record on Thames | work = [[The Times]] | date = 23 March 1990 | first = Mike | last = Rosewell |page =40 | issue = 63661}}</ref>  Cambridge president Paddy Mant won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station.<ref name=lbl>{{Cite news | title = Light Blue light at the end of the tunnel | work = [[The Times]] | date = 2 April 1990 | first = Mike |last = Rosewell | page = 36 | issue = 63669}}</ref>  A minute into the race, Cambridge held a third-of-a-length advantage, but as the crews approached the Fulham bend, Oxford drew alongside.  Intelligent coxing from Oxford's Watts gained Oxford a lead of a length after three minutes.  With clear water at [[Harrods Furniture Depository]], Watts attempted to steer in front of Cambridge but was warned off by umpire Sweeney.  Oxford passed below [[Hammersmith Bridge]] holding a four-second advantage and made a push, taking the lead out to six seconds by Chiswick Steps.  Settling for a lower rating, Oxford were eight seconds clear by [[Barnes Railway Bridge]], and despite a late surge by Cambridge, Oxford passed the finishing post seven seconds and two-and-a-quarter lengths ahead.<ref name=lbl/>  The crews recorded the fourth- and fifth-fastest times in Boat Race history.<ref name=gall>{{Cite news | title = A day when a gallant loser made it come right| work = [[The Times]] | first = David | last = Miller | date = 2 April 1990 | page = 36| issue = 63669}}</ref>

In the reserve race, Cambridge's [[Goldie (Cambridge University Boat Club)|Goldie]] won as Oxford's Isis were disqualified.<ref name=results/>  After taking a three-quarter-length lead, a clash of blades resulted in irreparable damage to the Cambridge boat and a red flag from umpire John Garrett.<ref name=lbl/>  Cambridge won the 45th [[Women's Boat Race]] by three-and-a-quarter lengths in a time of 7 minutes and 17 seconds, their third victory in four years.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/women/results | publisher = The Boat Race Company Ltd| title = Women's Boat Race <U+2013> Results| accessdate = 6 July 2014}}</ref>

==Reaction==
[[Roy Jenkins|Lord Jenkins]] presented the Beefeater Trophy to winning president Searle.<ref name=lbl/>  Cambridge coach Mark Lees said of his crew "It was the best they could do." and of Adam Wright, his stroke, who "relentlessly drove Cambridge", he commented: "It was one of the most courageous things I have ever seen".<ref name=gall/> Lees' counterpart, Steve Royle, acknowledged "Cambridge raced very well."<ref name=lbl/>
