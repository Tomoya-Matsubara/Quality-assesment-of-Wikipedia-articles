The '''Romanian Air Force''' ({{lang-ro|For<U+0163>ele Aeriene Rom<U+00E2>ne}}) is the [[air force]] branch of the [[Romanian Armed Forces]]. It has an air force headquarters, an operational command, four air bases and an air defense brigade. Reserve forces include two air bases and three airfields.

In 2010, the Romanian Air Force employed 9,700 personnel.

==Current state==
The Romanian Air Force modernized 110 [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG 21 LanceRs]], in cooperation with [[Israel]] between 1993 and 2002. Today, 48 of these MiG 21 LanceRs are operational.<ref>9am.ro, [http://www.9am.ro/stiri-revista-presei/Actualitate/22166/Batalia-gigantilor-pentru-aviatia-militara-romaneasca ''B<U+0103>t<U+0103>lia gigan<U+0163>ilor pentru avia<U+0163>ia militar<U+0103> rom<U+00E2>neasc<U+0103>'' ("Battle of giants for the Romanian Air Force")], from [[Ziua]], November 7, 2005</ref> The Romanian Air Force also operates [[C-130 Hercules]], [[C-27J Spartan]], [[An-26]]s transport planes and  [[IAR 330|IAR-330 Puma]] helicopters. [[IAR 330|IAR-330 PUMA SOCAT]] helicopters have been modernized by the [[Industria Aeronautic<U+0103> Rom<U+00E2>n<U+0103>|Romanian Aviation Industry]] in cooperation with [[Elbit Systems]] ([[Israel]]) for attack missions. The Romanian Air Force also includes native-made [[IAR 99|IAR-99 <U+015E>oim]] jet planes, in general only used for training of the young pilots. The remaining [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29s]] have been removed from service in 2003.

Due to the old age of the MIGs, the Romanian Air Force is considering procurement of new fighters, or possibly used fighters as an interim solution. Romanian Defense Minister Corneliu Dobritoiu said his country aims to buy an undisclosed number of second-hand F-16A/B jet fighters from Portugal. Earlier this year, local media reported that Romania sought to buy used F-16s from the Netherlands, but the plan was eventually scrapped. In March 2010, Romanian President Traian Basescu told local media the government was considering the purchase of 24 second-hand F-16s from the U.S. for about $1.3 billion.

In the spring of 2009, the Romanian government decided to purchase [[VSHORAD]]/[[SHORAD]] systems from France.<ref>[http://articles.janes.com/articles/Janes-Missiles-And-Rockets-2009/Romania-reveals-VL-MICA-order.html Romania reveals VL MICA order, SURFACE-TO-AIR]</ref> The deal included [[Mistral (missile)|Mistral]] [[MANPADS]] and [[MICA (missile)|MICA VL]] [[surface-to-air missiles]].<ref>[http://www.roaf.ro/ro/cer_senin/arhiva/2009/cer_senin_3_2009.pdf Cer Senin Magazine, nr. 3/2009, page 10]</ref> However, after preliminary talks with [[MBDA]] in August, the deal was put on hold and canceled afterwards because of the defense cuts.<ref>[http://www.jurnalul.ro/jurnalul-national/jurnalul-national/defense-under-external-pressure-521816.html Defense under external pressure]</ref>

In February 2010, the [[Supreme Council of National Defense (Romania)|Supreme Council of National Defense]] signed an agreement with the United States for missile defense under whose terms land-based [[RIM-161 Standard Missile 3|SM-3]] systems would be installed in Romania. On the 3rd of May 2011, the president of Romania [[Traian B<U+0103>sescu]] announced the location for the SM-3 systems. They will be installed at the former Air Force base [[Deveselu]] in [[Olt County]].<ref>[http://www.gandul.info/news/basescu-anunta-locul-unde-vor-fi-amplasate-in-romania-rachetele-americanilor-ce-spune-primarul-din-deveselu-chemat-luni-seara-la-cotroceni-sa-si-dea-acordul-8219766 B<U+0103>sescu announces the location of the US rockets]</ref> The system includes 3 batteries with 24 SM-3 Block I rockets, manned by approximately 200 US soldiers (with a maximum of 500) under Romanian Air Force overall command.

The current chief of the Romanian Air Force Staff, succeeding [[General]] [[Ion-Aurel Stanciu]] on 7 January 2011, is [[Major General]] [[F<U+0103>nic<U+0103> C<U+00E2>rnu]].

==History==
{{ROAF}}
[[File:Aurel Vlaicu.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aurel Vlaicu]] in his ''Vlaicu I'' prototype.]]

===Beginnings===
Romania was one of the first countries in the world to have an air force, starting with 1913. In 1912, the Romanian Air Force commissioned 10 Vlaicu I aircraft, built by [[Aurel Vlaicu]] in [[Bucharest]].

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], Romania acquired 322 aircraft from [[France]] and [[Great Britain]] including: [[Nieuport]] fighters (types 11, 17 12, 19, 21, 23, 24 and 28), [[Farman]] reconnaissance and light bombing aircraft (types 40 and 46), and [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Anonyme des Ateliers d'Aviation Louis Breguet|Breguet]]-[[Michelin]] heavy bombers. On September 16, 1916, a Romanian [[Farman F.40]] shot down an [[Luftstreitkr<U+00E4>fte|Imperial German Air Force]] aircraft near [[Slobozia]]; this was the first victory in the history of the Romanian Air Force. By the end of World War I, Romanian pilots had achieved about 11,000 hours of flight and fought 750 air battles.

===Golden Age===
During the [[interwar period]], the RoAF, second only to [[Poland]] among the future [[Warsaw Pact]] countries, had a powerful national aircraft industry which designed and produced all types of military and most civil aircraft. In particular the [[IAR 80]] series were stressed-skin fighters, worthy to rank with the other single-seat fighters of WWII, and used in significant numbers on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].

The RoAF was reorganized during an 18-year period.  Over 2,000 military and civil aircraft were built in Romania, based on native or licensed designs. The military aviation used IAR 80 fighters, which became famous on the Eastern Front, and bombers manufactured by [[IAR]] [[Bra<U+015F>ov]]. [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] and [[Heinkel He 112]] fighters, [[Heinkel He 111]] and [[Junkers Ju 88]] bombers, [[Junkers Ju 87]] [[dive bomber]], [[Junkers Ju 52]] transport and [[Heinkel He 114]] [[seaplanes]] were purchased from [[Germany]] in the interwar period.

===World War II===
[[File:IAR-80.jpg|thumb|A pair of [[IAR 80|IAR-80]] fighters on patrol during [[World War II]]]]
{{Main|For<U+0163>ele Aeriene Regale ale Rom<U+00E2>niei}}
When Romania, allied with [[Nazi Germany]], went to war against the [[USSR]], on June 22, 1941, the Romanian Air Force had 621 airplanes, including its native made fighter [[IAR 80|IAR 80/81]]. The air force accomplished hundreds of missions, contributing to Romania's recapture of [[Northern Bukovina]] and [[Bessarabia]], which had been occupied by the [[Soviet Union]] a year earlier. Until the [[Odessa]] episode, the Romanian military fighters gained 661 air victories. Romanian Military Aviation fought on the Eastern front until August 22, 1944, bringing an important contribution to the great battles in [[Stalingrad]], [[Crimea]], and the Ukrainian fronts.
Between 1941-1944 Romanian aircraft won 2,000 air victories. The most famous [[flying ace]]s were [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]] Prince [[Constantin Cantacuzino (aviator)|Constantin Cantacuzino]], who gained 68 certified victories, Captain [[Horia Agarici]] and Captain [[Alexandru <U+015E>erb<U+0103>nescu]], who shot down 60 enemy airplanes.

===Cold War===
[[File:MiG-21MF(DF-SN-83-01219).jpg|thumb|left|250px|A pair of Romanian MiG-21 fighters during late 70's.]]
[[File:MiG-29A50RO.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Romanian Air Force [[MiG-29]], currently retired and in storage since 2003.]]
Starting with 1948, Romania tailored its military to Soviet concepts and doctrine. On February 15, 1949, the Aviation Command was established based on the Soviet model (regiments instead of flotillas). New Soviet aircraft,  such as [[Yakovlev Yak-18]], [[Polikarpov Po-2]], [[Lavochkin La-9]], [[Tupolev Tu-2]], and [[Ilyushin Il-10]] entered service. A year later, 77 [[Yakovlev Yak-17]]s and [[Yakovlev Yak-23]]s entered the air force,  and in 1952, other 88 aircraft: [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] and [[MiG-17]]. In 1958, the first supersonic fighter [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19|MiG-19]] entered the inventory. Three years later, in February 1962, a new fighter was added to the inventory, [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]], which represented one of the most effective fighters of that time.

Starting with 1974, Romanian-made aircraft supplemented the already existing jets. The Romanian [[IAR-93]] [[subsonic aircraft]] flew its first flight on 31 October 1974. It represented a great step forward taking into account that it was the only jet fighter not made by the Soviets, the only one ever manufactured and operated by a [[Warsaw Pact]] country.

In 1962, the first helicopter subunits were established and followed later on, in 1965, by the first Soviet [[Mil Mi-2|Mi-2]] and [[Mil Mi-4|Mi-4]] helicopters. Renewing the aircraft fleet process went on, the first 12 [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23s]] entering the service between July<U+2013>September 1979.

On 14 May 1981, at 20:16, Soviet [[spacecraft|spaceship]] Soyuz-40 was launched from [[Baikonur]] to perform a common Romanian-Soviet flight, with [[Lieutenant]] [[Dumitru Prunariu]] and [[Colonel]] [[Leonid Popov]] as commander on board. During the early 80's 67th Fighter-Bomber Regiment and 49th Fighter-Bomber Regiment from [[Craiova]] and [[Ianca]] were equipped with new [[IAR-93]] attack aircraft which have replaced old [[MiG-15]]s and [[MiG-17]]s.  In December 1989, just a few days before the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Romanian revolution]] against communism began, [[MiG-29]] aircraft had entered the Air Force inventory.

==2007 Baltic Air Policing==
[[File:MIG 21 gata de decolare.jpg|thumb|A pair of [[MiG-21|MiG-21 LanceR 'C']]s of the [[RoAF 71st Air Base|71st Air Flotilla]] ready to take off in [[Lithuania]].]]
Four MiG-21 LanceR Cs were deployed from August 2007 to November 2007 at [[<U+0160>iauliai]], in [[Lithuania]] for [[Baltic Air Policing]]. The Romanian detachment succeeded the [[French Air Force]] [[Mirage 2000]]Cs of ''Escadron de Chasse 01.012'' from [[Cambrai]], which fulfilled the Baltic Air Policing since May 2007. Once the RoAF finished its three-month stint, a [[Portuguese Air Force]] detachment  took over the mission.<ref>[[Air Forces Monthly]], November 2007 issue, p.36.</ref>

The four aircraft and most of the staff came from the [[RoAF 71st Air Base|71st Air Base]]. A total of 67 personnel, among them nine pilots, were part of the detachment: 63 served at <U+0160>iauliai, while other four served at the air traffic control centre in [[Kaunas]], to ensure smooth cooperation with local authorities. The Romanian detachment attracted attention from the local media, not least from the fact that it was only the second time a fighter from the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era deployed to [[<U+0160>iauliai]] - [[Polish Air Force]] [[MiG-29]]s have also been deployed there in 2006.<ref>[[Air Forces Monthly]], November 2007 issue, p.37.</ref>

==2007 Romanian Air Force IAR-330 SOCAT crash==
Three people were killed on November 7, 2007, when an [[IAR 330|IAR-330 Puma SOCAT]] attack helicopter belonging to the [[RoAF 90th Airlift Base|90th Airlift Base]] crashed in [[Ungheni, Arge<U+015F>|Ungheni]], near [[Pite<U+015F>ti]], [[Arge<U+015F> County]].
