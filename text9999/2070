== Design ==
''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' was produced in [[1995 in video gaming|1995]] by [[Kazuhiko Aoki]] and directed by [[Akihiko Matsui]], [[Yoshinori Kitase]] and [[Takashi Tokita]]. The development of the game was dubbed the "Dream Project", because it was headed by a "Dream Team" composed of supervisor [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], of ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' fame, as well as [[freelance]] supervisor [[Yuuji Horii]] and character designer [[Akira Toriyama]], both of ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' fame.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Square Announces the Release of Final Fantasy Chronicles: Final Fantasy IV & Chrono Trigger for the PlayStation Game Console in July 2001 |publisher=[[Business Wire]] |date=2001-04-17 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2001_April_17/ai_73302271 |accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref> Yuuji Horii worked on the general outline of the story; as a fan of [[time travel in fiction|time travel]] fictions, such as the TV series ''[[Time Tunnel]]'', he focused on a theme of time travel for ''Chrono Trigger''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yuji Horii interview |url=http://www.playmagazine.com/index.php?fuseaction=SiteMain.showGamePage&Game_ID=169 |author=Play staff |work=[http://playmagazine.com/ play Magazine Online] |publisher=Fusion Publishing |accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref> The outline was then finalized by story planner and script writer [[Masato Kato]].<ref>{{cite web |title=This month's friend...

In [[1996 in video gaming|1996]], Masato Kato and several other members of the ''Chrono Trigger'' staff worked on a minor project for the [[Super Famicom]] [[Satellaview]] extension, titled ''[[Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai H<U+014D>seki]]''. Initially, the game was intended to be a short, original text-based adventure developed in three months with almost no planning. Nevertheless, by the end of the development, Masato Kato had connected the game's plot and characters to ''Chrono Trigger'', turning it into a [[side story]]. Since the platform of the game was not mainstream, the connections were however left blurred on purpose and were not advertised on the game's release.<ref name="GamePro">{{cite web |title=Chrono Cross - GamePro.com Interview, Fan Questions |url=http://www.gamepro.com/sony/psx/games/features/6818.shtml |author=GamePro staff |work=[[GamePro]] |publisher=IDG Entertainment |accessdate=2007-05-19 |date=2000-11-24}}</ref>

In [[1999 in video gaming|1999]], a continuation of ''Chrono Trigger'', titled ''[[Chrono Cross]]'', was announced as being in development. Although the "Dream Team" members did not participate in ''Chrono Cross'', the game was developed mostly by the same staff as the first installment.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chrono Trigger Staff Remains |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2450841.html |last=Sato |first=Yukiyoshi Ike |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CNET Networks]] |accessdate=2007-05-20 |date=1999-07-20}}</ref> In terms of basic system and gameplay, producer [[Hiromichi Tanaka]] made it clear that the new installment was not a sequel to ''Chrono Trigger''; rather, the game designers' approach was to make the "gameplay evolve with the hardware", creating a completely new game while restructuring the former style so as to maximize the performance of the console.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chrono Cross Development Team Interview and Contest |url=http://www.gamepro.com/sony/psx/games/features/6764.shtml |author=GamePro staff |work=[[GamePro]] |publisher=IDG Entertainment |accessdate=2007-05-19 |date=2000-12-01}}</ref> The gameplay focuses on the theme of [[parallel universe (fiction)|paralel worlds]] rather than time travel, although the latter is still deeply involved in the game's plot. In terms of storyline, ''Chrono Cross'' was described by director and scenario writer Masato Kato as "not a ''Chrono Trigger 2''", but "a result of a pulled trigger", "another ''Chrono''".<ref name="CrossOST">{{cite book |last=Kato |first=Masato |authorlink=Masato Kato |title=''Chrono Cross Original Soundtrack'' (liner notes) |date=1999-12-18 |publisher=[[DigiCube]] |language=Japanese |id=SSCX-10040}}</ref>

== Music ==
{{main|Music of the Chrono series}}
The music of the ''Chrono'' series was mainly composed by [[Yasunori Mitsuda]]. ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' was the first for which he had served as composer. However, after Mitsuda contracted [[stomach ulcer]]s, ''Final Fantasy'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]] was brought onto the project to compose ten songs.<ref>{{Cite book |year=2004 |author=[[Chris Kohler|Kohler, Chris]] |title=[[Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life]] |publisher=DK Publishing |id=ISBN 0-7440-0424-1}}</ref> At the time of the game's release, the quantity of its tracks and sound effects were unprecedented.<ref name="npreview1">{{Cite book | year=1995 | author=Averill, Alan | title=Nintendo Power July, 1995 | pages=52 | language=English | publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> Additionally, a one-disc [[acid jazz]] arrangement called ''[[Music of the Chrono series#The Brink of Time|The Brink of Time]]'' was also released. Mitsuda went on to compose the soundtrack for ''[[Radical Dreamers]]'', which was never commercially released as an album.

In [[1999 in video gaming|1999]], Yasunori Mitsuda, now a freelance composer, returned to score the soundtrack for ''[[Chrono Cross]]'' after being contacted by Masato Kato.<ref name="ultimania">{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Chrono Cross Ultimania | pages=476<U+2013>477 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-925075-73-X}}</ref> Mitsuda decided to center his work around [[old world]] cultural influences, including Mediterranean, [[Fado]], [[Celtic music|Celtic]], and percussive [[Music of Africa|African]] music.<ref name="CrossOST" /> ''[[Xenogears]]'' contributor [[Tomohiko Kira]] played guitar on the beginning and ending themes.

In [[2006 in video gaming|2006]], Yasunori Mitsuda arranged versions of music from the ''Chrono'' series for [[Play! A Video Game Symphony|Play!]] video game music concerts, presenting the ''Chrono Trigger'' and ''Chrono Cross'' main themes, as well as "Frog's Theme", and "To Far Away Times".<ref name="nsider">{{cite web |last=Driker |first=Brandon |title=Play!

''Chrono Brake'' and '''''Chrono Break''''' are the names of two [[trademark]]s owned by [[Square Co.]]; the first applied in Japan on [[November 5]], [[2001 in video gaming|2001]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Industrial Property Digital Library | url=http://www.ipdl.inpit.go.jp/homepg_e.ipdl |work=[[Industrial Property Digital Library]] |publisher=[[Japan Patent Office]] |accessdate=2007-05-20 |date=2002-07-26}}<br />To find the ''Chrono Brake'' patent, search "Japanese Trademark Database" for "chronobrake".

"Time and Space Adventures: Nuumamonjaa"}} is a 16-minute humoristic and promotional ''Chrono Trigger'' [[anime]] which was broadcast at the [[Japan]]ese [[V-Jump]] Festival of [[July 31]], [[1996]]. It was created by [[Production I.G]], and written by [[Hiroshi Izawa]] and Akihiro Kikuchi, while Itsuro Kawazaki served as director, [[Tensai Okamura]] as [[animation director]], and Riho Nishino as character designer. It was never commercially released.<ref>{{cite web |title=<U+6642><U+7A7A><U+5192><U+967A><U+306C><U+3046><U+307E><U+3082><U+3093><U+3058><U+3083><U+FF5E> |url=http://www.production-ig.co.jp/contents/works_sp/0330_/index.html |author=Production I.G staff |publisher=[[Production I.G]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Dimensional Adventure Numa Monjar |url=http://www.production-ig.com/contents/works/07_/000133.html |author=Production I.G staff |publisher=[[Production I.G]] |accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref>

The anime takes place in the same setting as ''Chrono Trigger'', the night before the beginning of the game's events. The empty Millennial Fair is invested by a festive gathering of monsters coming through portals. The two protagonists, a [[Characters of Chrono Trigger#Other non-playable characters|Nu]] and a Mamo (a type of monster called Kilwala in the English version of the game), voiced by [[Chaf<U+016B>rin]] and [[Mayumi Tanaka]] respectively, try to recruit members for their group "Nuumamonjaa". Finding no one willing to join them, they wander the fair and interrupt the robot [[Characters of Chrono Trigger#Johnny|Johnny]]'s show, who is voiced by [[Shinichir<U+014D> Miki]].

Later, Nu enters a drinking contest and wins a golden shovel, with the help of a controller that resembles that of a [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]]. Nu goes into the bushes after the contest to urinate, and stumbles upon Gonzalez (a robot called Gato in the English version of the game). Gonzalez, voiced by [[Fumihiko Tachiki]], activates and chases the group, while singing his line from the game: ''Aa Gonzaresu. Ore-wa tsuyoi. Ore ni kattara shirubaa pointo'' ("Ah, Gonzalez. I am strong. Beat me up and get silver points").

Eventually, Nu and Mamo end up on Gonzalez' back as he runs uncontrollably, entering a race against Johnny. In an attempt to stop Gonzalez, Nu presses a large button on Gonzales' back, which causes a large boxing glove on a spring to hit Johnny. A dazed Johnny flies through the air and solemnly recites a [[haiku]] before smashing into a wall. Gonzalez' singing voice can still be heard from where Nu and Mamo are.

In the morning, Gato is still singing, but runs out of power and falls to the ground.  A group of people is seen watching in the foreground, including [[Characters of Chrono Trigger#Crono|Crono]] and [[Characters of Chrono Trigger#Lucca|Lucca]]. The credits show Nu and Mamo parodying scenes from the game.
