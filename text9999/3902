'''Cesare Battisti''' (born 18 December 1954) is an [[italia]]n former member of the [[Armed Proletarians for Communism]], a [[Far-left politics|far-left]] [[Militant (word)|militant]] and [[terrorist]] group which committed acts of illegality and [[crimes]] in Italy during the period known as "[[anni di piombo]]". Sentenced for 4 homicides (2 policemen, 1 jeweler and 1 butcher) to life sentence in Italy. Currently he's a writer and he lives as a free man in [[Brazil]]: after he flew to [[France]] and [[Mexico]] became a fiction author and writing 15 books.

Battisti was sentenced to 12 years under the charge of participating in an armed group and of the material killing of 2 people and being the mandate for other 2 homicides. He fled to [[France]], where he received protection under the [[Mitterrand doctrine]]. Later, he was [[trial in absentia|tried ''in absentia'']] based on testimony in Pietro Mutti's trial implicating him in four assassinations, bringing the total of charges against him to 36. He was given a sentence of [[life sentence|life in prison]]. After the de facto repeal of the Mitterrand doctrine in 2002, Battisti entered in [[Brazil]] with fake documents to avoid a possible extradition.

He was arrested in [[Rio de Janeiro]] on 18 March 2007 by Brazilian and French police officers. Later, Brazilian Minister of Justice [[Tarso Genro]] granted him the status of [[political refugee]], in a controversial decision which was much criticized in Italy, whereas divided Brazilian and international press opinion.<ref>Economist.com, [http://www.economist.com/world/americas/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12974127 ''The madness of asylum'']</ref><ref>Le Journal du Dimanche. 14/01/2008.

On 31 December 2010, Lula's last effective day as president, the decision not to allow extradition was officially announced.

Battisti was released on 9 June 2011 from [[prison]] after the Brazilian Constitutional Court denied Italy's request to extradite him.

== Youth and PAC membership ==
Cesare Battisti was born in 1954 at [[Sermoneta]], near [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]]. He left the [[Lyceum#Italy|classical lyceum]] he was attending in 1971, engaged in petty crime, and then moved on to more serious offenses.<ref>[http://www.iltempo.it/cronache/2012/12/12/l-appello-battisti-in-italia-e-in-galera-1.207919 L'appello: "Battisti in Italia e in galera" - Il Tempo]</ref>

In 1976 he moved to [[Milan]], and took part in activities of the PAC, an [[autonomist Marxist]] group which conducted armed struggle, and which had a "horizontal", decentralized structure, opposed to the centralist organisation of the [[Red Brigades]] (BR). The organisation, which counted approximately 60 members, had its roots in a district in southern Milan, called Barona. 

Four assassinations were committed by the PAC: Antonio Santoro, a prison guard accused by the PAC of mistreatment of prisoners (on June 6, 1978 in [[Udine]]), jeweler Pierluigi Torregiani (on February 16, 1979 in Milan), Lino Sabadin, a butcher (on the same date, near [[Mestre]]), and [[DIGOS]] agent Andrea Campagna, who had participated in the first arrests in the Torregiani case (on April 19, 1979 in Milan). The PAC also engaged in several robberies.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The murder of Torregiani and Sabbadin had been decided by the PAC because both of them had killed a robber-terrorist in the past, thus as an act of armed opposition to self-defense by attacked persons.<ref>[http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/justice/la-culpabilite-de-battisti-repose-sur-des-preuves_490352.html <U+00AB>La culpabilit<U+00E9> de Battisti repose sur des preuves<U+00BB>], interview with public prosecutor [[Armando Spataro]], in ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'', 15 March 2004 {{fr icon}}</ref> Torregiani was killed as revenge in front of his 13-year-old son, who was also shot by his father as a result of a tragic error.<ref name="Evangelisti">[[Valerio Evangelisti]], [http://cesarebattisti.free.fr/articles/50questions.html ''Valerio Evangelisti r<U+00E9>pond <U+00E0> 50 questions''] {{fr icon}}</ref> The paraplegic Torregiani considers now that, in any case, Battisti is responsible for the shooting, and should serve his sentence in jail: "It's not about the person of Cesare Battisti - he declared to the national press agency ANSA - It's in order that everyone understands that, sooner or later, those who have committed such serious crimes should pay for their faults".<ref>{{it icon}} [http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/notizie/rubriche/approfondimenti/visualizza_new.html_2113687881.html Torregiani: A Cesare Battisti chiederei solo perche], 18/03/2007</ref>

Cesare Battisti has stated in several texts that he abandoned political violence after Prime Minister [[Aldo Moro]]'s kidnapping and subsequent murder in May 1978, carried out by the Second Red Brigades led by [[Mario Moretti]]

== First trial and escape ==
Cesare Battisti was arrested and jailed in Italy on February 26, 1979, sentenced to 12 and a half years in prison for participation in an "armed group" ("partecipazione a banda armata"). He was sentenced on the ground of material evidence<ref>''[http://www.lefigaro.fr/litteraire/20060420.LIT000000278_battisti_persiste_et_signe.html Battisti persiste et signe]'', [[Guillame Perrault]]</ref> and [[testimony|testimonies]] provided by two "''[[collaboratori di giustizia]]''" (defendants who testified against their former accomplice) who benefitted from lighter condemnations for their testimony.<ref name=LDH>[http://www.ldh-toulon.net/spip.php?article1940 Cesare Battisti: dire la v<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>, respecter les droits], [[Human Rights League (France)|Human Rights League]] (LDH), public statement of March 17, 2007 {{fr icon}}</ref> The status of "collaboratore di giustizia", also popularly known as ''pentito'', was established by [[anti-terrorist legislation]] enacted during this period.

PAC members organised his escape on October 4, 1981, while he was in [[Frosinone]] prison. Battisti fled to [[Paris]] and then for [[Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca]], [[Mexico]], very shortly afterward. While in Mexico, he founded a literary review, ''Via Libre'', which is still active.<ref name="vialibre">[http://www.vialibre5.com/ ''Via Libre 5'', Cesare Battisti (dir.)]</ref> He also participated in the creation of the Book Festival of [[Managua]] (Nicaragua) and organised the first Graphic Arts Biennal in Mexico. Cesare Battisti began to write at the suggestion of [[Paco Ignacio Taibo II]] and collaborated with various newspapers.

== Second trial ==

Pietro Mutti, one of the leaders of the PAC who had been sentenced ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' for the assassination of prison surveillant Santoro, was arrested in 1982. He sought the status of "collaboratore di giustizia" and his testimony, which helped him reduce his sentence, implicated Battisti (and an accomplice) in the four assassinations claimed by the PAC. Battisti's trial was thus reopened in 1987, and he was sentenced in absentia in 1988 for two assassinations (Santoro and DIGOS agent Campagna) and complicity of murder in the two other (jeweler Torregiani and butcher Sabbadin). The court sentenced him, in appeal, to a [[life-sentence]] in 1995. Two years before, the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]] had quashed, on procedural grounds, the case against Battisti's  accomplice, accused by Pietro Mutti.<ref 
name="Evangelisti">[[Valerio Evangelisti]], [http://cesarebattisti.free.fr/articles/50questions.html ''Valerio Evangelisti Repond <U+00C0> 50 Questions''] {{fr icon}}</ref>

Two of the assassinations occurred on February 16, 1979, one at Milan at 15h, and the other in Mestre, 270&nbsp;km away from Milan, at 16h50. Battisti was sentenced for materially committing the first assassination, and for planning the second one.

== Battisti's return to France ==
Ten years earlier, in 1985, the President of France [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Mitterrand]] had indicated that "leftist Italian activists who were not indicted for violent crimes and had given up terrorist activity would not be [[Extradition|extradited]] to Italy"; this became known as the "[[Mitterrand doctrine]]". Many Italian political activists had fled to France during the 1970s-1980s. Trusting in this declaration, Battisti returned to France in 1990, where he was arrested on Italy's request in 1991, when his sentence was confirmed in the Court of Cassation. He thus passed five months in [[Fresnes prison]] and then was freed after the extradition request was rejected by the [[Paris Appeal Court]] on May 29, 1991. French justice concluded that the [[anti-terrorist legislation]] enacted in Italy "went against the French principles of law," which, along with the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR), prohibited in particular to extradite a person sentenced ''in absentia'' if that person had not been in a condition to adequately defend himself during his trial.<ref name=LDH/> The court also defined the evidences held against Battisti as "contradictory" and "worthy of a military justice."<ref>Vantaggiato, Iaia (2009) [http://www.ilmanifesto.it/archivi/fuoripagina/anno/2009/mese/01/articolo/247/ ''Cesare Battisti, no all'estradizione''] quotation: {{quotation|Nell'aprile '91 la Chambre d'Accusation lo dichiar<U+00F2> non estradabile in base alla dottrina Mitterrand che garantiva protezione ai latitanti per motivi politici. La magistratura francese boll<U+00F2> le prove a suo carico come "contraddittorie" e "degne di una giustizia militare".}} Original French quotation: {{quotation|dignes d'une justice militaire}}</ref>

After his release in 1991, Battisti lived in Paris, where he wrote his first novel, ''Les Habits d'ombre'' ("Shadow clothes"). Two thrillers, ''L'Ombre rouge'' ("Red shadow") and ''Buena onda'', took as backdrop the Parisian world of Italian fugitives from justice. Another major novel, titled ''Derni<U+00E8>res cartouches'' ("Last bullets"), takes place in Italy during the "years of lead". 

In 1997, jointly with other left-wing Italians who had fled to France and were accused of taking part in violent crimes, he asked without success the [[President of Italy]] at the time, [[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]] ([[Christian Democracy (Italy)|DC]]) for an [[amnesty]].

== A diplomatic dispute between France and Italy ==
Over the years, Italy asked France several times to arrest and extradite left-wing Italians involved in court cases connected with political violence in Italy and who had fled to France. On September 11, 2002 the extradition of Battisti and others was again requested during the meeting in Paris between Italy's [[Italian Minister of Justice|Minister of Justice]] [[Roberto Castelli]] and France's [[Minister of Justice (France)|Minister of Justice]] [[Dominique Perben]].

==Arrest in France==
On February 10, 2004, the French government arrested Battisti on Italy's request and planned to extradite him to Italy. On June 30, 2004, the Paris Court of Appeal gave a favorable opinion for his extradition. An appeals in the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] was filed against this opinion and another recourse introduced before the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'<U+00C9>tat]]'' against the extradition [[decree]]. President Jacques Chirac stated on July 2, 2004 that he would not oppose French justice's decision to extradite him. Perben confirmed Paris' new position: "There is no ambiguity. There has been a change of attitude from France, and I support it," (in reference to the "Mitterrand doctrine"), among other reasons "because of the European construction".<ref name="QAG-mallie">[http://www.ump.assemblee-nationale.fr/article.php3?id_article=3262 Richard Malli<U+00E9>, deputy of the [[Bouches-du-Rh<U+00F4>ne]], ''Question au gouvernement: Extradition de Cesare Battisti'', 26/10/2004] {{fr icon}}</ref><ref name="RFI">[http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/033/article_17832.asp Clarisse Vernhes, <U+00AB> Paris pr<U+00EA>te <U+00E0> extrader d<U+2019>autres <U+00AB>brigadistes<U+00BB>], in ''[[Radio France Internationale|RFI]]'', 2002 {{fr icon}}</ref>

As of 2007, only [[Paolo Persichetti]], former member of the ''[[Unit<U+00E0> Comuniste Combattenti]]'', among the 200 Italians involved in Court cases dealing with political violence requested by Italy, was extradited (in August 2002). He was eventually sentenced to 22 years of prison. Minister [[Edouard Balladur]] had signed Persichetti's extradition decree in 1994; it was validated by the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'Etat]]'' the following year.<ref name="RFI" /> According to [[Radio France Internationale|RFI radio station]], the Perben-Castelli agreement was divided in three parts: all events before 1982 would be [[medical prescription|prescribed]] "except in case of exceptional gravity"; facts between 1982 and 1993 would be "examined on a case by case basis", in function of the [[European Convention of Human Rights]] (ECHR) principle and of the "conditions in which the trials took place in Italy".

Still claiming his innocence, Cesare Battisti failed to check in at the local police station, while on parole, on August 21, 2004 and went under.

On March 18, 2005, the French [[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'Etat]] (the French Supreme Court in administrative law), ruling ultimately for Battisti's extradition, affirmed clearly that the Italian legislation did not conflict with the French principles of law. The Conseil established that: 

<blockquote>''the circumstance that some of the charges held against Mr Battisti, which led to the cited sentences, are partly based on statements by "repented" witnesses, is not contrary to French public order and does not constitute an infringement by Italian authorities of the requirements of Article 6 of the European Human Rights and fundamental liberties safeguard convention (...)''.<ref>"Consid<U+00E9>rant que la circonstance que certaines des charges retenues contre M. Battisti, et qui ont donn<U+00E9> lieu aux condamnations pr<U+00E9>cit<U+00E9>es, reposent pour partie sur des d<U+00E9>clarations de t<U+00E9>moins " repentis ", n'est pas contraire <U+00E0> l'ordre public fran<U+00E7>ais et ne constitue pas une m<U+00E9>connaissance, par les autorit<U+00E9>s italiennes, des stipulations de l'article 6 de la convention europ<U+00E9>enne de sauvegarde des droits de l'homme et des libert<U+00E9>s fondamentales (...)" [[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'Etat]]'s http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurispd/index_ac_ld0515.shtml</ref></blockquote>

ECtHR, then, confirmed those decisions and ruled that the Italian trial in absentia in Battisti's case was fair under its provisions. 

In July 2005, the Italian press revealed the existence of the [[Department of Anti-terrorism Strategic Studies]] (DSSA), a "parallel police" created by [[Gaetano Saya]], leader of ''[[Destra Nazionale]]'' neofascist party, and [[Riccardo Sindoca]], two leaders of the National Union of the Police Forces (''Unpf''). Both claimed they were former members of [[Gladio]], NATO's "stay-behind" paramilitary organization involved in Italy's [[strategy of tension]] and various alleged activist acts. According to ''[[Il Messaggero]]'', quoted by ''[[The Independent]]'', judicial sources declared that wiretaps suggested DSSA members had been planning to kidnap Cesare Battisti.<ref>{{cite news | title=Up to 200 Italian police 'ran parallel anti-terror force' | publisher=[[The Independent]] | date=2005-07-05 | url=http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article296897.ece | location=London | first=John | last=Philips | accessdate=April 28, 2010}} (URL accessed on January 22, 2007)</ref>

On 5 February 2005, the European Parliament adopted a resolution in which it expressed its trust "that the re-examination of the decision on the extradition of Cesare Battisti will take into account the judgment delivered by an EU Member State in full compliance with the principle of the rule of law in the European Union"<ref name="europarl.europa.eu" />

The [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR), in its December 2006 decision, rejected Battisti's claim that France's extradition decision was illegitimate. The Court considered that:

<blockquote>The applicant had patently been informed of the accusation against him and of the progress of the proceedings before the Italian courts, notwithstanding the fact that he had absconded. Furthermore, the applicant, who had deliberately chosen to remain on the run after escaping from prison, had received effective assistance during the proceedings from several lawyers specially appointed by him. Hence, the Italian and subsequently the French authorities had been entitled to conclude that the applicant had unequivocally waived his right to appear and be tried in person. The French authorities had therefore taken due account of all the circumstances of the case and of the Court<U+2019>s case-law in granting the extradition request made by the Italian authorities: manifestly ill-founded.<ref>[[European Court of Human Rights]]'s [http://www.echr.coe.int/Eng/InformationNotes/INFONOTENo92.htm decision] (Sub art. 6, "claims inadmissible" : Life sentence following a conviction in absentia in "Battisti v. France," Information note n. 92)</ref></blockquote>

== Asylum in Brazil ==
Battisti fled to [[Brazil]] and was arrested in [[Rio de Janeiro]] on March 18, 2007.

After that the government of Brazil granted Cesare Battisti the status of [[political refugee]] through a decision of its Minister of Justice [[Tarso Genro]]. Battisti's request for asylum was first denied by the National Committee for Refugees, in a decision taken by simple majority. His defense appealed to the Minister of Justice, who granted in January 2009 refugee status, a decision which divided Brazilian public opinion.<ref>http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u490815.shtml</ref> Refugee status, however, halts the request for extradition, which is being considered by the Brazilian Supreme Court.

Italian President [[Giorgio Napolitano]] wrote to Brazilian President
[[Luiz In<U+00E1>cio Lula da Silva]], informing him of the "emotion and understandable reactions" raised in his country, in public opinion and among political forces by this "grave decision". Italian Justice Minister, Angelino Alfano, has asked Brazilian authorities to reconsider this decision "in the light of international cooperation against terrorism".<ref>Gazeta do Povo, 17/01/2009. [http://portal.rpc.com.br/gazetadopovo/vidapublica/conteudo.phtml?tl=1&id=848074&tit=Presidente-da-Italia-manda-carta-de-pesar-a-Lula-pelo-asilo-a-Battisti ''Presidente da It<U+00E1>lia manda "carta de pesar" a Lula pelo asilo a Battisti''].</ref> Lula answered Napolitano, mentioning that Genro's decision is founded on the Brazilian constitution and on the UN 1951 Convention on Refugee Status and is an act of sovereignty of Brazil.<ref>Folha de S<U+00E3>o Paulo. 23/01/2009.

Criticism was also based on speculations about the influence exerted by [[Carla Bruni]], spouse of the French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], on Genro's decision.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKTRE50O1ND20090125 | work=Reuters | title=Bruni denies asked Brazil not to extradite Italian | date=January 25, 2009}}</ref> Brazilian Senator [[Eduardo Suplicy]] attested to ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' that Bruni herself asked Lula to refuge Battisti. Bruni denied this claim on a [[RAI]] interview as she expressed her condolences with the families of Battisti's  victims.<ref>Folha de S<U+00E3>o Paulo. 25/01/2009. [http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u494286.shtml ''Carla Bruni nega participa<U+00E7><U+00E3>o em decis<U+00E3>o brasileira de refugiar Battisti''].</ref>

Controversy surrounded Genro's decision on granting refugee status to Battisti. Many law specialists have spoken saying that the decision was illegal. The Brazilian Supreme Court started trying the case in September 2009. By 5 votes to 4 (simple majority), the court ruled Genro's decision null and void on 18 November. However, the court also decided by 5 votes to 4 on the interpretation that the Brazilian constitution gives the president of the executive branch personal powers to deny the extradition if he chooses to, effectively putting the final decision in the hands of Brazilian President [[Luiz In<U+00E1>cio Lula da Silva]]. 

On the 29 December 2010, unofficial reports in Italy and Brazil said President Lula was about to announce he had denied the extradition of Battisti, just 3 days short of ending his presidential mandate. The official announcement took place on December 31, hours before the end of Lula's mandate.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/31/brazil-lula-berlusconi-battisti-italy "Lula sparks diplomatic spat with Italy over refusal to extradite killer"] [[The Guardian]], Friday 31 December 2010 18.54 GMT</ref>

On 8 June 2011, the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled that Lula's decision regarding the non-extradition of Battisti is final.<ref>[http://br.noticias.yahoo.com/stf-rejeita-reclama<U+00E7><U+00E3>o-it<U+00E1>lia-caso-battisti-211500066.html "STF rejeita reclama<U+00E7><U+00E3>o da It<U+00E1>lia no Caso Battisti"]</ref>
Italian authorities announced their intention to appeal to the International Court of Justice against Brazil for breaching the extradition treaty.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13708698 "Cesare Battisti extradition: Italy to go to Hague court"] [[BBC News]]</ref>

In November 2013, the [[Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina]] invited Battisti to speak at a conference.<ref>http://www.egov.ufsc.br/portal/conteudo/ufsc-paga-vinda-de-criminoso-condenado-na-it%C3%A1lia-para-falar-aos-alunos</ref>
==Public opinion==
Cesare Battisti denied having committed any of the murders he has been sentenced for. The circumstances of his sentence have been put in question.{{by whom|date=November 2013}} A movement claiming Battisti's innocence is active in the media and in public opinion (especially in France). Among the most vocal supporters of Battisti, writers [[Fred Vargas]], [[Valerio Evangelisti]] and  [[Bernard-Henri L<U+00E9>vy]] consider that the trials conducted in Italy were marked by irregularities. These alleged irregularities involved the use of [[torture]] (Battisti's French lawyers have not used this peculiar charge, the violation of article 3 ECHR, in their rejected claim to ECtHR), and the misuse of [[witnesses]]: according to Battisti's supporters, witnesses against Battisti were either affected by mental troubles, or were "collaboratori di giustizia", (that is, defendants testifying against other defendants in order to benefit from a reduced sentence. Those peculiar witnesses are also used by French justice, i.e. art. 132-78 French Code Penal). Battisti's supporters also claim that [[Forensic ballistics|ballistic]] analysis and graphological expertises used in Italian court cases do in fact, contrary to what the Courts considered, exonerate Battisti.<ref name="Evangelisti" /><ref 
name="CBRJP">[[Fred Vargas]], [http://www.acontresens.com/forum/read.php?id_forum=1&id_topic=10160 <U+00AB> Cesare Battisti: A la recherche de la justice perdue <U+00BB>] in ''La R<U+00E8>gle du Jeu'', n<U+00B0>30 (January 2006) {{fr icon}}</ref><ref 
name="macavale-r631">Cesare Battisti, ''Ma Cavale'', 27/4/2006, Preface p. 13 {{fr icon}}</ref>

Most of public opinion in Italy disagrees with those views, and Battisti's arrest in Brazil has been commented upon favourably in the media. [[Communist Refoundation Party|Rifondazione Comunista]], however, considers that he should not be extradited, as he would not be granted the right to a new trial. In France, supporters of Battisti, such as [[Gilles Perrault]], have called this arrest, a few weeks before the [[French presidential election, 2007|April 2007 presidential election]], an "electoral feat," closely timed by the then Interior Minister [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], candidate for the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] conservative party. [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Bayrou]], candidate for the [[Union for French Democracy|UDF]] right-of-center party, has called for a new trial, as have members of the left-wing.<ref name=LDH/>

Defenders of Battisti, among whom the [[Human Rights League (France)|Human Rights League]] (LDH), consider that France's decision to extradite Battisti was illegal, since Battisti would not have the right to a new trial, after having been judged ''in absentia''.

But the alleged right to a new trial is not a sufficient guarantee for the defendant, as clearly ruled the ECtHR in the case of Krombach v. France, application no. 29731/96, and also article 6 of ECHR, the juridical ground of Battisti's claim against extradition, doesn't prescribe a new trial. ECHR establishes that there is not an absolute right to a new trial, after a trial in absentia. Battisti's claim concerned the defendant's knowledge of the trial, and Battisti's lawyers argued that the defendant had not been in a position to know that in Italy there was a trial against him and so his rights had been violated.

The [[Union syndicale des magistrats]]  (USM, the largest trade union of French judges) has supported the fairness of the Italian trial in absentia and has also confirmed the legality of Battisti<U+2019>s condemnation:<ref>Communiqu<U+00E9> [[Union syndicale des magistrats|USM]] Affaire Battisti in http://usm2000.free.fr/article.php3?id_article=142</ref> 
<blockquote>'' "L'USM condamne le proc<U+00E9>d<U+00E9> consistant, dans une perspective purement id<U+00E9>ologique, <U+00E0> discr<U+00E9>diter une d<U+00E9>cision de justice rendue par une cour d<U+2019>assises italienne, dans le strict respect des r<U+00E8>gles de proc<U+00E9>dure p<U+00E9>nale (appel et cassation) s<U+2019>agissant d<U+2019>un accus<U+00E9> en fuite mais d<U+00E9>fendu <U+00E0> tous les stades de la proc<U+00E9>dure conform<U+00E9>ment au droit italien en vigueur."</blockquote> Translation : "The USM condemns the procedure consisting in discrediting, in a purely ideological perspective, a justice decision emitted by an Italian Assizes Court, in strict respect of penal legal procedures (appeals and "Cassation"), in the case of a defendant not appearing in Court but defended in each and every stage of procedure in accordance with Italian prevailing legislation."
