'''''The Final Days''''' is a 1976 [[non-fiction]] book written by [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]]. A follow up to their book ''[[All the President's Men]]'', ''The Final Days'' concerns itself with the final months of the [[Richard Nixon]] presidency.

As stated in the book's foreword, all the information and scenarios depicted were taken from interviews with 394 people who were involved.  All that was stated in these interviews was considered on the record but the identity of the sources remained confidential.  Every detail was thoroughly checked and any information that could not be confirmed by two separate accounts was left out of the book. 

In 1989, a television adaptation of the book aired.  It starred [[Lane Smith]] as Nixon.  It was nominated for five [[Emmys]] and a [[Golden Globe]].
