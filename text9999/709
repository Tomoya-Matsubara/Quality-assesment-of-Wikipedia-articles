The wreck has given archaeologists two major discoveries: the biggest single collection of [[Tang Dynasty]] artefacts found in one location, the so called "Tang Treasure"; and the Arabian dhow, which gives a new insight into the trade routes between China and the Middle East during that period. The treasure has been kept as one collection and, during the excavation, the efforts to preserve the integrity of the site and its cargo have resulted in detailed archaeological evidence. This evidence has given new insight into the construction methods used in shipbuilding, and the items and style of artefacts has revealed previously unknown facts about the trade between the two areas.

===Route===
It is unclear why the ship was so far from its expected route (shown in red on the map to the right),<ref name=SEAArch1>{{cite web|title=The Belitung Shipwreck|url=http://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/2007/06/28/the-belitung-shipwreck/|publisher=South East Asian Archaeology|accessdate=18 February 2011|date=28|month=June|year=2007|quote=The Belitung shipwreck is located a little too far south.|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090611055106/http://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/2007/06/28/the-belitung-shipwreck/|archivedate=08 July 2011}}</ref> as most ships leaving China for Arabia would have sailed through the [[South China Sea]]. They would then turn north-west after passing southern [[Vietnam]], continuing through the [[Singapore Strait]] into the [[Straits of Malacca]] between [[Peninsular Malaysia]] and [[Sumatra]]. Belitung is some distance from this route, and it is unclear how the vessel came to be in this area. Belitung is to the south-east of the Singapore Strait by {{convert|380|mi|km}}, and this secondary route is more normal for ships travelling from the [[Java Sea]], which is south of Belitung Island, to the Straits of Malacca {{convert|380|mi|km}} north of the Island.<ref name=BBC1>{{cite web|title=The treasure trove making waves|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7675866.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 February 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090611055106/http://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/2007/06/28/the-belitung-shipwreck/|archivedate=08 July 2011}}</ref>

==Ship and construction==

They are used as cargo vessels and have one or two masts with triangular sails.|The shipwreck is of a dhow similar in size and construction to this one, in Oman.]]
The shipwrecked dhow was approximately {{convert|21|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|58|ft|m}} long<ref name=WAMF>{{cite journal|last=Flecker|first=Michael|title=A ninth-century AD Arab or Indian shipwreck in Indonesia: First evidence for direct trade with China|journal=World Archaeology|date=1 January 2001|volume=32|series=Shipwrecks|issue=3|pages=335<U+2013>354|doi=10.1080/00438240120048662|publisher=Taylor & Francis Ltd.}}</ref> and is remarkable for two reasons; it is the first ancient Arabian ship to be found and excavated,<ref name=STTaTWFlecker>{{cite book|title=Shipwrecked; Tang Treasures and Monsoon Winds.|year=2010|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-1-58834-305-5|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/Shipwrecked/downloads/07Flecker.pdf|author=Michael Flecker|editor=Regina Krahl, John Guy, J.

The wreck timbers were found under a sediment that preserved the remains of the wooden vessel, without which the wreck would have been lost due to [[marine worm]]s.<ref name=ADN>{{cite web|title=Secrets of the Tang Treasure Ship|url=http://www.archaeologydaily.com/news/200908091865/Secrets-of-the-Tang-Treasure-Ship.html|publisher=Archaeology Daily News|accessdate=24 February 2011}}</ref> Wrecks of this age are rare finds and this particular one was in such a good condition that much of the hull was preserved.<ref name=ARI16b>{{cite journal|title=The Pre-Modern East Asian Maritime Realm: An Overview of European-Language Studies|journal=Working Paper Series|year=2003|month=December|volume=No. 16|pages=87|author=Geoff Wade|publisher=Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore|page=20}}</ref> This has given us an insight into how ships of this period were constructed<U+2014>something which has not been seen before as no Arabian ship of this type had previously been found, nor any with their cargo intact.<ref name=MarineEX1/>

Pieces of the original timbers were preserved enough to allow scientists to analyse them and determine some of the [[Belitung_shipwreck#Wood_types|types of wood]] used. It is possible that the ship was constructed in western Asia and bought by Arabian merchants to be used for the Oman to China route; the cargo contains many Arabian-inspired artefacts.<ref name=IJNAFlecker1>{{cite journal|last=Flecker|first=Michael|title=A 9th-century Arab or Indian shipwreck in Indonesian waters|journal=The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology|date=1|year=2000|month=August|volume=29|issue=2|pages=199<U+2013>217|doi=10.1006/ijna.2000.0316|publisher=IJNA}}</ref>

===Construction techniques===
The ship was constructed around a {{convert|50.2|ft|m}} long [[Boat_building#Parts|keel]] of {{convert|14|-|15|cm|in|adj=on}} thickness, which is believed to have survived intact.<ref name=IJNAFlecker1/> The front of the ship had a 61<U+00B0> [[Rake (angle)|angle of rake]] at the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] where the [[Boat_building#Parts|stem post]] was joined to the keel with [[mortise and tenon]] joints and secured with {{convert|16|mm|in|adj=on}} diameter rope.<ref name=IJNAFlecker1/> The hull planks were stitched onto the [[Hull (watercraft)|frames]] and keel through holes spaced at {{convert|5|-|6|cm|in|adj=on}} intervals.<ref name=IJNAFlecker1/> The boat had a [[keelson]] for added strength, which rested on the half-frames.<ref name=WAMF />

Michael Flecker, the chief excavating archaeologist at the site, compared the wrecked ship to three types of the same period and concluded that the wreck most resembled "lashed-lug" ships of south-east Asia<U+2014>first used in the 5th century.<ref name=WAMF /> He said that fully stitched boats were found from the African coast, Oman, in the Red Sea, on the Indian coast, and as far as the Maldives.<ref name=IJNAFlecker1/> He notes that Roman references by [[Procopius]] in the 6th century tell of boats with planks stitched together in a similar fashion used in "Indian Seas".<ref name=IJNAFlecker1/> Though Arabian ships of this type have not been found before, they are mentioned in text including the late-Tang ''Ling biao lu yi'' ("Strange Things Noted in the South"). According to John Guy, curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the book "describes the ships of foreign merchants as being stitched together with the fiber of coir-palms and having their seams caulked rather than using iron nails to secure their planks".<ref name=STTaMWExCatGuyp24>{{cite book|title=Shipwrecked; Tang Treasures and Monsoon Winds.|year=2010|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-1-58834-305-5|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/shipwrecked/downloads/02Guy.pdf|author=John Guy|edition=Cloth|editor=John Guy|accessdate=18 August 2011|page=24|chapter=Rare and Strange Goods: International Trade in Ninth-Century Asia}}</ref>

===Wood types===
Samples of wood from the shipwreck were sent for analysis at the Forest and Forest Products division of the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) in Australia.<ref name=IJNAFlecker1/><ref name=CSIROIlicdiv>{{cite web|title=Wood identification - Indiana Jones' envy|publisher=CSIRO|accessdate=18 August 2011|format=Press release|date=12|month=January|year=2000}}</ref> The analysis was conducted by Jugo Ilic of CSIRO, a wood                                               identification specialist. Many of the samples were too badly deteriorated to be positively identified, as the lack of cellulose remaining in the wood cells prevented successful analysis.<ref name=IJNAFlecker1/>

There are many types of wood that have been positively identified: teak (''[[Tectona grandis]]'') was used for the through-beams and is resilient to the [[Shipworm|teredo worm]] (the Teredinidae family), the ceiling was made from a ''[[Cupressus]]'' genus which was possibly ''[[Cupressus torulosa]]'', the stem-post is made of [[rosewood]] from the [[Fabaceae|Leguminosae]] family (now called the Fabaceae) and either the ''[[Dalbergia]]'' or ''[[Pterocarpus]]'' genus. The wooden box found in the stern area of the shipwreck was made from an ''[[Artocarpus]]'' genus of the [[Moraceae]] family, more commonly known as the [[Mulberry]] family.<ref name=IJNAFlecker1/>

The species used for the hull planks was not positively identified but is thought to be ''[[Amoora]]'' of the [[Meliaceae]] family. The timber for the frames was similarly not definitively determined, although one frame was probably of ''Amoora'' or of the ''[[Afzelia]]'' genus of the Fabaceae family.<ref name=IJNAFlecker1/> ''Afzelia'' is interesting in that the three main species ''[[Afzelia africana|A. africana]]'', ''[[Afzelia bipindensis|A. bipindensis]]'' and ''[[Afzelia pachyloba|A. pachyloba]]'' are mostly found in a small part of Africa, stretching from the mid-western coast in a thin band towards the west coast and stopping short of it by a couple of hundred miles.<ref name=IJNAFlecker1/><ref name=NatGeo3>{{cite web|title=Feature Article: Tang Shipwreck|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/06/tang-shipwreck/worrall-text/3|publisher=National Geographic|quote=...found in Oman and known as a baitl qarib ... it was built of Afri<U+00AD>can and Indian wood |accessdate=19 February 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090523162518/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/06/tang-shipwreck/worrall-text/3|archivedate=08 July 2011}}</ref>

The ship could originally have been said to be of Arabian or Indian origin, as there is little to differentiate between ships of the area during that period, in regard to construction techniques<U+2014>though its frame uses a species of tree that is only found in a small part of Africa.<ref name=ARI16b/> After analysing the hull form, timber species, and construction methods, Ilic concluded that the wreck was of Indian or Arabian origin. India was considered the more probable place of construction but Arabian construction was not ruled out, as the timber used was commonly imported to the Middle East for use in shipbuilding.<ref name=IJNAFlecker1/> Flecker concluded that the wreck was an Arabian ship in his 2010 chapter from the Sackler exhibition catalogue, arguing that "from an analysis of construction methods and materials and hull form, the author has determined that the Belitung wreck is an Arab vessel."<ref name=IJNAFlecker1/>{{rp|119}}

===Legacy===
Present-day knowledge of the original materials and methods used in construction of this particular Arab dhow stems largely from the shipwreck itself. The ''[[Jewel of Muscat]]'' reconstruction, a replica made as an exact copy of the wreck, has shown that the ship resembles a ''baitl qarib'', a type of ship still found in Oman today.<ref name=NatGeo3/> Amongst the hull of the shipwreck were large lumps of concretion containing artefacts from the ship's cargo dated to the [[Tang Dynasty]] of China around 800 AD, and from where the wreck gets its other names, the "Tang shipwreck" or "Tang treasure ship".<ref name=NatGeo3/><ref name=NatGeo4>{{cite web|title=SECRETS OF TANG TREASURE SHIP: ABOUT|url=http://natgeotv.com/asia/secrets-of-the-tang-treasure-ship/about|publisher=National Geographic Channel|accessdate=8 July 2011|year=2009}}</ref>

The ship's timbers and artefacts were be shown to the public for the first time in 2011. The world debut exhibition of the collection of artefacts, as well as timbers from the ship, took place in the [[ArtScience Museum]], adjacent to Singapore's [[Marina Bay Sands]].<ref name=MBSArtSciMusWD>{{cite web|title=Book now|url=https://entertainment.marinabaysands.com/EventSynopsis.aspx?ID=4344|publisher=Marina Bay Sands, Singapore|accessdate=8 July 2011|quote=Shipwrecked: Tang Treasures and Monsoon Winds, making its world debut}}</ref> The significance of the discovery of the shipwreck led to the decision to construct the ''Jewel of Muscat'' as an exact reconstruction of the shipwrecked dhow.<ref name=JewelConstHomage>{{cite web|title=Information Part 2|url=http://education.jewelofmuscat.tv/node/123|work=Advanced History|publisher=Sultanate of Oman|accessdate=8 July 2011|author=The Jewel of Muscat Project|year=2009|quote=In 1998, a shipwreck was discovered off the Indonesian island of Belitung ...

==Cargo and "Tang treasure"==
{{see also|Chinese ceramics|Chinese influences on Islamic pottery}}

The wreck held three main types of "wares" in the form of bowls: [[Chinese ceramics#Sui and Tang dynasties: 581-907|Changsha ware]], the majority of the 60,000 items, were originally packed in either straw cylinders or "Dusun" storage jars; [[Blanc de Chine|White-ware]], manufactured in the [[Chinese ceramics#Ding_ware|Ding kilns]] and including the earliest known intact underglaze [[Blue and white porcelain|blue and white]] dishes;<ref name=ARI16b /> and [[Yue ware]] from [[Zhejiang Province]].<ref name=ARI16b /> One [[Changsha]] bowl was inscribed with a date: "16th day of the seventh month of the second year of the Baoli reign", or 826 AD. This was later confirmed by [[radiocarbon dating]] of [[star anise]] found amongst the wreck.<ref name=BBC1/> The cargo had a surprising variety of influences and markets, including [[Padma (attribute)|Buddhist lotus]] [[Ashtamangala#Lotus|symbols]], motifs from Central Asia and Persia, [[Qur'an|Koran]]ic [[Muqatta'at|inscriptions]], and [[Chinese influences on Islamic pottery#China and the Islamic world|green-splashed]] bowls popular in [[Iran]].<ref name=NatGeo4>{{cite web|title=Tang Shipwreck|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/06/tang-shipwreck/worrall-text/4|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=18 February 2011|month=June|year=2009|author=Simon Worrall|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090523162522/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/06/tang-shipwreck/worrall-text/4|archivedate=08 July 2011}}</ref>

There were also special items found which include a gold cup<U+2014>the largest Tang dynasty gold cup ever found<U+2014>and a large silver flask decorated with a pair of ducks.<ref name=NatGeo4/> The gold cup has pictures of people in various actions on its sides, such as musicians and a Persian dancer.

Tilman Walterfang's company formed a contract of cooperation with the original Indonesian salvage company<ref name="FSSB" /> and as a result the cargo was not sold off piece by piece to collectors.

The [[Sackler Gallery]], part of the Smithsonian Institution, was due to host the US premiere exhibition of the Belitung cargo in early 2012<U+2014>a date set to coincide with the Smithsonian museum's 25th anniversary celebration.<ref name=SISackUSprem>{{cite web|title=Smithsonian and Singapore Organize World Tour of Shipwreck Treasure|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/press/prShipwreck.htm|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=28 June 2011}}</ref> On 28 June 2011 it was reported that the museum was postponing the show.<ref name=TNYTcancelled>{{cite web|title=Shipwreck Show Postponed|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/28/shipwreck-show-postponed/?scp=1&sq=Tang%20treasure&st=cse|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=15 July 2011|author=Kate Taylor|date=28|month=June|year=2011}}</ref> The Sackler Gallery has received condemnation of the exhibition due to the time-frame and nature of the original excavation of the artefacts; with arguments put forwards about whether the display should be allowed. According to ''The New York Times'', "a group of archaeologists and anthropologists from the National Academy of Sciences <U+2014> including Robert McCormick Adams, a former leader of the Smithsonian" wrote to the head of the Smithsonian Institution, G.Wayne Clough, on 5 April 2011 claiming that "proceeding with the exhibition would 'severely damage the stature and reputation' of the institution."<ref name=TNYTcontrov1>{{cite web|title=Archaeologists Criticize Smithsonian Over Java Objects|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/archeologists-criticize-smithsonian-over-java-objects/|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=15 July 2011|author=Kate Taylor|date=10|month=March|year=2011|quote=Three archaeological associations and three of the Smithsonian<U+2019>s internal research organizations have written to the Smithsonian<U+2019>s secretary, G.

Kimberly L. Faulk, a marine archaeologist and vice chairwoman of the non-governmental Advisory Council on Underwater Archaeology said that, "by proceeding with the exhibition the Smithsonian <U+2014> which is a research institution as well as a network of museums <U+2014> would be violating its own set of professional ethics and promoting the looting of archaeological sites."<ref name=TNYTcontrov1/>

Proponents of the arguments to display the works claim that the excavation was indeed legal as the work was carried out in accordance with Indonesian law, at the request of the Indonesian government, and in accordance with international laws at the time.<ref name=FSGcontrov>{{cite web|title=Smithsonian Hosts Discussion on Issues Surrounding the Exhibition of the Belitung Cargo|work=Shipwrecked: Tang Treasures and Monsoon Winds|publisher=The Smithsonian Institute|format=Press release|date=25|month=April|year=2011|quote=Found in shallow water, the shipwreck was immediately vulnerable to looting and accidental destruction from fishing activity. Recognizing the danger to the site, Indonesian authorities granted a license to a commercial salvage company to recover the ship and its cargo.}}</ref> James P. Delgado, director of maritime heritage at the United States Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said that "allowing any of the finds from an excavation to be sold betrays the most basic aspects of research" with the ''New York TImes'' going on to report that, "he [Delgado] wished the Belitung shipwreck had been academically excavated. But unlike some of his colleagues, he said that instead of canceling the exhibition, the Smithsonian could use it to educate the public about the consequences of the commercialization of underwater heritage."<ref name=TNYTcontrov2/>

Walterfang has stated that "the overall situation would without doubt be described as 'less than ideal'"<ref name=TNYTcontrov2/>{{rp|2}} and that "the Indonesian government, fearful of looting, ordered Seabed Explorations to begin an immediate round-the-clock recovery operation."<ref name=TNYTcontrov2/>{{rp|1}}

===Conventions by international organisations===
The Underwater Archaeology Resolutions that were adopted on 10 September 1993 by the International Congress of Maritime Museums (ICMM) state that:

{{quote|ICMM member museums should follow the Council of American Maritime Museums (CAMM) policy and '...not knowingly acquire or exhibit artifacts which have been stolen, illegally exported from their country of origin, illegally salvaged, or removed from commercially exploited archaeological or historic sites' in recent times (ie. since the 1990 full Congress of ICMM)."|International Congress of Maritime Museums<ref name=ICMMa>{{cite web|title=Underwater Archaeology Resolutions Adopted by ICMM Barcelona, Spain 10 September 1993|url=https://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/SW-CulturalHeritage/downloads/ICMMArchaeologyPolicy.pdf|publisher=International Congress of Maritime Museums|date=10 September 1993|accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref>}}

They also say that, "ICMM members should recognize that artefacts from underwater sites are integral parts of archaeological assemblages, which should remain intact for research and display" and that, "a commercially exploited heritage site is one in which the primary motive for investigation is private financial gain."<ref name=ICMMa/> The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) ratified a set of rules for preserving and excavating underwater sites at the Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage during 15 October <U+2014> 5 November 2001.<ref name=UNESCO2001>{{cite web|title=Convention on the protection of the underwater cultural heritage|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001260/126065e.pdf|publisher=UNESCO|date=2 November 2001|accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> Though the rules set out at the meeting do include preserving artefacts ''in situ''<ref group=nb name=UNESCO2001>"The preservation in situ of underwater cultural heritage shall be considered as the first option before allowing or engaging in any activities directed at this heritage."</ref> as the preferable option they go on to say:

{{quote|The commercial exploitation of underwater cultural heritage for trade or speculation or its irretrievable dispersal is fundamentally incompatible with the protection and proper management of underwater cultural heritage. Underwater cultural heritage shall not be traded, sold, bought or bartered as commercial goods. This Rule cannot be interpreted as preventing:
(a) the provision of professional archaeological services or necessary services incidental thereto whose nature and purpose are in full
conformity with this Convention and are subject to the authorization of the competent authorities;|UNESCO
