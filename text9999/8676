'''Castle Hill''', also called '''Mere Castle''', was a medieval [[castle|fortification]] built by [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard]], the [[Earl of Cornwall]], in 1253 on a hill overlooking the village of [[Mere, Wiltshire|Mere]], [[Wiltshire]], England. The castle was constructed in stone, with six towers, inner buildings and gates. It was abandoned in the 14th century and stripped of its stone and metalwork. Only earthworks remain in the 21st century.

==History==
===Construction===
The village of [[Mere, Wiltshire|Mere]] was a small and unimportant settlement in the early 13th century.<ref name=Mcmahon2004P12>{{harvnb|Mcmahon|2004|p=12}}</ref> In 1243 [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard]], the [[Earl of Cornwall]], acquired the manor.<ref name=Mcmahon2004P12/> Richard was the brother of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] and immensely rich.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodall|2011|p=188}}</ref> In 1253 he began to build a castle at Mere.<ref name=Mcmahon2004P12/> 

The castle was built on top of a local hill, overlooking the village; the hill was flattened and [[Counterscarp|scarped]], with a {{convert|5|m|adj=on}} deep ditch cut into the west side.<ref name=Mcmahon2004P12/> As archaeologist Phil Mcmahon describes, documentary sources imply the castle was "a rectangular stone-built structure with six towers, incorporating a hall, an inner and outer gate, a deep well and a chapel", and it may have resembled a smaller version of [[Framlingham Castle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mcmahon|2004|pp=7, 12}}</ref> The castle was probably entered from the west, with a possible road running up the south side of the hill.<ref>{{harvnb|Mcmahon|2004|p=14}}</ref> At the same time the village was expanded into a planned town with an unofficial market.<ref>{{harvnb|Mcmahon|2004|pp=5, 12}}</ref> The castle was renovated in 1300, possibly in response to the threat of rebellion in England at the time.<ref name=Mcmahon2004P12/>

===Decline===
Richard's son [[Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall|Edmund]] inherited the property, but on his death it was taken back by the Crown.<ref name=Mackenzie1896P230>{{harvnb|Mackenzie|1896|p=230}}</ref> Edward II gave it to his royal favourite, [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Piers Gaveston]], whom he made Earl of Cornwall.<ref name=Mackenzie1896P230/> Edward II and Gaveston fell from power in 1327 and [[John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall|John]], Edward's second son, took possession as the new Earl of Cornwall.<ref name=Mackenzie1896P230/> [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] then reacquired the castle, which became a permanent part of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]].<ref name=Mackenzie1896P230/> 

During the 14th century, however, the castle had declined and became abandoned.<ref name=Mcmahon2004P7>{{harvnb|Mcmahon|2004|p=7}}</ref> In 1398 [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] had the lead taken from the castle roofs for reuse at [[Portchester Castle]].<ref name=Mcmahon2004P7/> In 1660, visitors' accounts imply that the stonework had all been dismantled, and 18th-century accounts suggest that this was reused for construction work in the town below, which had prospered from the [[Economy of England in the Middle Ages#Merchants and the development of the charter fairs|wool]] and later [[linen]] trade.<ref>{{harvnb|Mcmahon|2004|pp=5, 7}}</ref>

===21st century===
In the 21st century the site is protected under law as a [[scheduled monument]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/English%20sites/3645.html | title=Mere Castle Hill | accessdate=10 January 2013 | publisher=Gatehouse}}</ref> It is owned by the Duchy of Cornwall, and leased to the local parish council.<ref name=ParishP4>{{cite web | url=http://merewilts.org/mpc/News_archive/Castle_LongHill_ManagementPlan.pdf | archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6HaM8nxOj| title=Castle and Long Hill, Mere, Wiltshire: Management Plan | archivedate = 23 June 2013| accessdate=10 January 2013 | publisher=Mere Parish Council|page =4}}</ref> A flagpole, which is illuminated at night, and a [[war memorial|memorial]] to the  [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]]  are located on the castle site.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://merewilts.org/mpc/News_archive/Castle_LongHill_ManagementPlan.pdf | archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6HaM8nxOj|title=Castle and Long Hill, Mere, Wiltshire: Management Plan | archivedate = 23 June 2013|accessdate=10 January 2013 | publisher=Mere Parish Council|pages =4-5}}</ref> A ceremony is held at the castle site each [[Easter]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://merewilts.org/mpc/News_archive/Castle_LongHill_ManagementPlan.pdf | archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6HaM8nxOj| archivedate = 23 June 2013| title=Castle and Long Hill, Mere, Wiltshire: Management Plan | accessdate=10 January 2013 | publisher=Mere Parish Council|page =5}}</ref>

==Archaeological investigation==
Archaeological excavations of the site were carried out in 1887 by T. H. Baker and C. N. Wyld, but most of the results of their work were subsequently lost.<ref>{{harvnb|Mcmahon|2004|p=5}}</ref>
