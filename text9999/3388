{{nihongo|'''Genki Horiguchi'''|<U+5800><U+53E3> <U+5143><U+6C17>|''Hiromasa Horiguchi''}} , (September 15, 1978) is a Japanese professional wrestler.  He is currently a full time wrestler and booker<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wrestling.insidepulse.com/2009/04/23/puroresu-pulse-issue-147-more-with-jae| title=Puroresu Pulse, issue 147 |date=2009-04-23 |accessdate=2009-04-23 |author=David Ditch |publisher=InsidePulse.com |quote=Genki Horiguchi is (according to Meltzer) the booker of Dragon Gate. }}</ref> for [[Dragon Gate]].  He has also competed in [[Wrestling Society X]] and [[Ring of Honor]].

When Horiguchi's hairline began receding, the fans began to chant H-A-G-E (Japanese for 'bald') at him. He managed to use this to gain a sort of cult popularity, and his catchphrase, "Who has called me hage?", is one of the best known in Japan<ref> {{cite web |url=http://dragongate.shiningwizard.com/df.html |title=Do FIXER: Genki Horiguchi |accessdate= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=2004 |month= |format= |work= |publisher=DragonGate.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061031160856/http://dragongate.shiningwizard.com/df.html |archivedate=2006-10-31 |quote= }} </ref>.

''Hiromi Horiguchi'', a wrestler currently working for [[Toryumon|Toryumon Mexico]], was thought for some time to be Genki's brother, but the relationship was only a gimmick.  <ref>{{cite web |url=http://wrestling.insidepulse.com/2009/04/23/puroresu-pulse-issue-147-more-with-jae| title=Puroresu Pulse, issue 147 |date=2009-04-23 |accessdate=2009-04-23 |author=David Ditch |publisher=InsidePulse.com |quote=Turns out Hiromi is only his gimmick brother. Guess that explains why he was never brought in. }}</ref>

==Career==
===Toryumon===
Horiguchi debuted in Toryumon as a face wrestler with a surfer gimmick. In 2001, he began to lose his hair, and in November he turned heel, cast away his surfer gimmick, and joined the original M2K as a replacement for Chocoflake K-ICHI. He was the last wrestler to be added to the group.  

During his days in the M2K stable, he held the NWA World Welterweight Title twice, defeating Ryo Saito to win it, vacating the title after a no-contest match with Dragon Kid, defeating Ricky Marvin to win it again, and finally losing it to M2K stablemate Darkness Dragon.  As part of Do FIXER, he won the UWA World Trios Titles with Susumu Yokosuka and Ryo Saito.  

He was responsible for bringing in Magnum TOKYO to lead the remnants of M2K after the name was sealed.  In 2002, he would team with Magnum TOKYO and Darkness Dragon in a three-way trios tag team match against Ryo Saito, [[Masaaki Mochizuki]] & [[Dragon Kid]] and [[Nobuhiko Oshima|CIMA]], [[Don Fujii]] & [[Yoshikazu Taru]] and was pinned by CIMA. <ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.insidepulse.com/article_v3.php?contentid=4993&rssAuthor=1 |title=The SmarK Rant For The Best Of Japan 2002 - Volume 4 |accessdate= |author=Keith, Scott |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2003-12-27 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=InsidePulse.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref> 

In December 2003, he scored a series of upset wins, most of them via backslide. This led to the rise of the Backslide from Heaven.

===Dragon Gate===

While in Do FIXER, he formed a friendship with [[Ryo Saito]] that would endure for several years.  He teamed with Saito to defeat [[The Florida Brothers]] at the 2004 Revolucion ppv event on January 31, 2004. <ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.wrestling101.com/101/article/PuroR/487/ |title=Toryumon January 2004 Revolucion PPV Review |accessdate= |author=Chedy, Jason |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2004-09-28 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Wrestling101.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref>.  He, Saito and Dragon Kid would win the Open the Triangle Gate Championship three times while teaming together in Do FIXER.  The three of them would travel to [[Ring of Honor]] to take part in a match against Blood Generation's [[Nobuhiko Oshima|CIMA]], [[Naruki Doi]] & [[Masato Yoshino]], which would be given a rare five-star rating by famous wrestling columnist [[Dave Meltzer]].

In January 2007, he betrayed Saito and Do FIXER to join heel stable [[Muscle Outlaw'z]]. He underwent a radical transformation in appearance, and added blue mist to his arsenal. This turn lead him to an [[Open the Brave Gate]] title run, and a pinfall victory over CIMA in an 8 man elimination match (incidentally not his first direct win over CIMA).  He feuded with gaijin [[Matt Sydal]] over the title before dropping it to [[Yasushi Kanda]].  After dropping the title, his push was not maintained. He began wrestling mainly early on the cards, taking the falls in multi-person matches, and was winless during all of March 2008.  He began to develop kleptomania, stealing Tozawa-juku's pants and Anthony W. Mori's ring costume.  

During the unit turmoil in the early parts of 2008, Genki remained firmly on the heel side of Muscle Outlaw'z, and followed them to Real Hazard.  He acted as secretary to the Brave Gate belt commissioner [[Yoshito Sugamoto]], which was actually the Brave Gate champion (and his fellow MO'z stablemate) Gamma himself, enforcing the outrageous rules randomly put in place by him that allowed Gamma to win title matches or retain his title if he lost the match. 

On July 27, 2008, Genki defeated m.c.KZ to win the vacant Open the Brave Gate title for a second time. Despite the title win his push was not increased, as he didn't score any wins over any wrestler in higher standing than he had been previously.  He defended it twice before losing it to Masato Yoshino on October 12, and then went right back to taking the falls in most multi-person matches for the remainder of 2008 and into 2009.  He developed a rivalry with [[Takayuki Mori|Anthony W. Mori]].

With Ryo Saito having turned heel in February 2009 and joining the Real Hazard stable, he and Genki have begun teaming again.  He suffered a leg injury on March 22, 2009, but it was not severe and he returned on April 3, 2009.

===Outside the Dragon System===

Appearing in [[Aja Kong]]'s '''"Yo! All the Members Set"''' 20th anniversary card, he teamed with Ryo Saito and [[Naoki Tanisaki]] against CIMA, [[Naruki Doi]] and [[Masato Yoshino]] at [[Korakuen Hall]] in [[Tokyo, Japan]] on August 21, 2005. <ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.joshipuro.com/cutenews/show_archives.php?archive=1122167476&subaction=list-archive& |title=First matches announced for Aja's show |accessdate= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2005-07-11 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=JoshiPuro.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref>

At the beginning of 2007 he was briefly affiliated with the Wrestling Society X company that was run by MTV. He and [[Masato Yoshino]] were a tag team known as Team Dragon Gate. They would however only win an exploding cage timebomb deathmatch in their time in this promotion.  At the time the team was active, he and Yoshino were in rival stables, as he was still aligned with face stable Do FIXER while Yoshino was in heel stable Blood Generation.
