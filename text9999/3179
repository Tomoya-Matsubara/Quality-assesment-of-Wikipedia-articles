Gilchrist earned the nickname "Black Magic" for her ability to match DNA evidence that other forensic examiners could not.<ref name="Time Magazine" />  She was also known for being unusually adept at testifying and persuading juries, thus obtaining convictions.<ref name="Time Magazine" /><ref name="fuhrman1">{{cite book|title=Death and Justice|last=Fuhrman|first=Mark|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=0060732083|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BtY4-YryxZsC&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=Joyce+Gilchrist&source=bl&ots=9tAZVae-U8&sig=3OVUW1U7MIhtRvGdzhoCh3KvAr4&hl=en&ei=1-0ESt7fAZzFtge63pWeBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5|accessdate=May 8, 2009|year=2003}}</ref> In 1994, Gilchrist was promoted to supervisor from forensic chemist after just 9 years on the job.<ref name="Time Magazine" />  But her colleagues began to raise concerns about her work.<ref name="lawar">{{cite book |last1=Dwyer|first1=Kevin|last2=Fiorillo|first2=Jur<U+00E9>|title= True Stories of Law & Order : The Real Crimes Behind the Best Episodes of the Hit TV Show|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8GpnqiGTAS0C&pg=RA1-PA220&dq=Joyce+Gilchrist&ei=zvIESrSPHpOCygTcqNQj|format= |accessdate=May 8, 2009|year= 2006 |publisher= Berkley Boulevard|location= New York|isbn=0425211908}}</ref><ref name="nyt1" /><ref name="Time Magazine" />

Gilchrist was dismissed due to "flawed casework analysis" and "laboratory mismanagement".<ref name="nyt1">{{cite news |title=Police Chemist Accused of Shoddy Work Is Fired |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/26/us/police-chemist-accused-of-shoddy-work-is-fired.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2001%2F09%2F26%2Fus%2Fpolice-chemist-accused-of-shoddy-work-is-fired.html&date=2009-05-09| |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=September 26, 2001|archivedate=May 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 9, 2009}}</ref>  Concerns about Gilchrist's actions were first raised when a landscaper, Jeffrey Todd Pierce, who had been convicted of rape in 1986 despite a clean record and good alibi largely based on Gilchrist's evidence, was exonerated based on additional DNA evidence.  Pierce was released after 15 years in prison.  After his release he filed a lawsuit against the state seeking 75 million dollars and charging that Gilchrist and Bob Macy, a now retired district attorney, conspired to produce false evidence against him.<ref name="nyt2" />

Other such cases, in which evidence exonerated someone who Gilchrist helped convict, include that of Michael Blair.  Blair was sentenced to die for the murder of a little girl in 1993.<ref name="nyt03" /> The evidence leading to his conviction included shafts of hair found near the girl's body and in Blair's car.<ref name="nyt03" /> New DNA evidence showed that the hair matched neither the girl, nor Blair.<ref name="nyt03">{{cite news |first=Barry |last=Scheck ;= |coauthors=Neufeld, Peter |title=Junk Science, Junk Evidence |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/11/opinion/junk-science-junk-evidence.html |work= |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=May 11, 2001 |accessdate=May 9, 2009}}</ref> During the early 1990s, Oklahoma state law did not allow defense attorneys to use government funds to hire another forensic scientists to verify Gilchrist's claims. However, during appeals of Malcolm Rent Johnson's death penalty case, two forensic experts hired by the defense were critical of Gilchrist's testimony, particularly as it relied upon several "blue-colored hairs" that seemed too "ubiquitous" to be useful evidence.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Yardley|title=Oklahoma Retraces Big Step in Capital Case |curly= |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/02/us/oklahoma-retraces-big-step-in-capital-case.html?pagewanted=2|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|pages=1-2|date=September 2, 2001 |accessdate=May 9, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2001%2F09%2F02%2Fus%2Foklahoma-retraces-big-step-in-capital-case.html%3Fpagewanted%3D2&date=2009-05-09 |archivedate=May 9, 2009}}</ref>

Over 1,700 cases in which Ghilchrist's evidence was significant to a conviction were reviewed by the state of Oklahoma.<ref name="nyt2">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Police Chemist's Suit Says Firing Was Retaliatory |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/26/us/police-chemist-s-suit-says-firing-was-retaliatory.html |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date= April 26, 2002|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2002%2F04%2F26%2Fus%2Fpolice-chemist-s-suit-says-firing-was-retaliatory.html&date=2009-05-09|archivedate=May 9, 2009|accessdate=May 9, 2009}}</ref><ref name="cbs1">{{cite news|title=Under The Microscope|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/05/08/60II/main290046.shtml|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=July 24, 2002|accessdate=May 9, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fstories%2F2001%2F05%2F08%2F60II%2Fmain290046.shtml&date=2009-05-08|archivedate=May 8, 2009}}</ref> Her attorney stated that, "The criticism of her around here is second only to that of Timothy McVeigh."<ref name="Time Magazine" />.  After her dismissal, Gilchrist filed a lawsuit seeking 20.1 million dollars, claiming that her firing was actually motivated by revenge, after she reported sexual misconduct by her supervisor.<ref name="nyt2" />
