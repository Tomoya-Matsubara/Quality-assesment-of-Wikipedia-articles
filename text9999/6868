The '''decline of Detroit''' refers to the continuing major economic and demographic decline the city of [[Detroit]] has gone through in recent decades. The [[Demographic history of Detroit|population of the city]] has fallen from a high of 1,850,000 in 1950 to 710,000 in 2010. Some of the [[United States cities by crime rate|highest crime rates]] in the United States are now occurring in Detroit, and huge areas of the city are in a state of severe [[urban decay]].

The [[deindustrialization]] of Detroit has been a major factor in the population decline of the city.<ref>{{cite web |first=Nicole |last=Hardesty |url =http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/23/detroit-decline_n_813696.html#218521 |title =Haunting Images Of Detroit's Decline (Photos) |publisher =The Huffington Post |date =March 23, 2011 |accessdate=February 10, 2013 }}</ref> It is thought by some that the decline was sparked by race-based city policies which caused more affluent whites to leave the city, reducing the tax base, and leading to fewer employment opportunities and customers in the city.<ref>{{cite web |first=Walter |last=Williams |url =http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials-perspective/121812-637538-detroit-collapse-was-due-to-race-based-politics.htm?p=full |title =Detroit's Tragic Decline Is Largely Due To Its Own Race-Based Policies |publisher =Investor's Business Daily |date =December 18, 2012 |accessdate=February 10, 2013 }}</ref>

==== 1950s job losses ====
In the postwar period, the city had lost nearly 150,000 jobs to the suburbs.  Factors were a combination of changes in technology, increased automation, consolidation of the auto industry, taxation policies, the need for different kinds of manufacturing space, and the construction of the highway system that eased transportation. Major companies like [[Packard]], [[Hudson Motor Car Company|Hudson]], and [[Studebaker]], as well as hundreds of smaller companies, went out of business. In the 1950s, the unemployment rate hovered near 10 percent.

==== 1967 Detroit riot ====
{{See|1967 Detroit riot}}

The summer of 1967 saw five days of African American riots in Detroit.<ref name="Voting With Their Feet">[[Thomas Sowell|Sowell, Thomas]] (2011-03-29) [http://www.lewrockwell.com/sowell/sowell38.1.html Voting With Their Feet], ''[[LewRockwell.com]]''</ref><ref>Young, Coleman. ''Hard Stuff: The Autobiography of Mayor Coleman Young'': p.179.</ref> Over the period of five days, forty-three people died, of whom 33 were black and ten white. There were 467 injured: 182 civilians, 167 Detroit police officers, 83 Detroit firefighters, 17 National Guard troops, 16 State Police officers, 3 U.S. Army soldiers.

2,509 stores looted or burned, 388 families rendered homeless or displaced and 412 buildings burned or damaged enough to be demolished. Dollar losses from arson and looting ranged from $40 million to $80 million.<ref name="ref1">{{cite web|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6553/ |title=Michigan State Insurance Commission estimate of December, 1967, quoted in the ''National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders'' AKA ''Kerner Report'' |date=1968-02-09 |accessdate=2011-04-24| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110605064836/http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6553/| archivedate= June 5, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==== Economic and social fallout of the 1967 riots ====
[[File:Incomemap.jpg|thumb|450px|Per capita income in Detroit and surrounding region from the 2000 census. The dotted line represents the city boundary.]]

After the riots, thousands of small businesses closed permanently or relocated to safer neighborhoods, and the affected district lay in ruins for decades.<ref>Sidney Fine, ''Violence in the Model City: The Cavanaugh Administration, Race Relations, and the Detroit Riot of 1967'' (1989)</ref>

Of the 1967 riots, [[Coleman Young]], Detroit's first black mayor, wrote in 1994:

{{quote|The heaviest casualty, however, was the city. Detroit's losses went a hell of a lot deeper than the immediate toll of lives and buildings. The riot put Detroit on the fast track to economic desolation, mugging the city and making off with incalculable value in jobs, earnings taxes, corporate taxes, retail dollars, sales taxes, mortgages, interest, property taxes, development dollars, investment dollars, tourism dollars, and plain damn money. The money was carried out in the pockets of the businesses and the white people who fled as fast as they could. The white exodus from Detroit had been prodigiously steady prior to the riot, totally twenty-two thousand in 1966, but afterwards it was frantic. In 1967, with less than half the year remaining after the summer explosion&mdash;the outward population migration reached sixty-seven thousand. In 1968 the figure hit eighty-thousand, followed by forty-six thousand in 1969.<ref>Young, Coleman. ''Hard Stuff: The Autobiography of Mayor Coleman Young'': p.179.</ref>}}

According to (African American) economist [[Thomas Sowell]]:
<blockquote>
Before the ghetto riot of 1967, Detroit's black population had the highest rate of home-ownership of any black urban population in the country, and their unemployment rate was just 3.4 percent. It was not despair that fueled the riot. It was the riot which marked the beginning of the decline of Detroit to its current state of despair. Detroit's population today is only half of what it once was, and its most productive people have been the ones who fled.<ref name="Voting With Their Feet">[[Thomas Sowell|Sowell, Thomas]] (2011-03-29) [http://www.lewrockwell.com/sowell/sowell38.1.html Voting With Their Feet], ''[[LewRockwell.com]]''</ref>
</blockquote>

====1970s and 1980s====
The departure of middle class whites left blacks in control of a city suffering from an inadequate tax base, too few jobs, and swollen welfare rolls.<ref>Heather Ann Thompson, "Rethinking the politics of white flight in the postwar city," ''Journal of Urban History'' (1999) 25#2 pp 163-98 [http://juh.sagepub.com/content/25/2/163.full.pdf+html online]</ref>  According to Chafets, "Among the nation<U+2019>s major cities, Detroit was at or near the top of unemployment, poverty per capita, and infant mortality throughout the 1980s."<ref>Z<U+2019>ev Chafets, "The Tragedy of Detroit," '' New York Times Magazine'' July 29, 1990, p 23, reprinted in Chafets, ''Devil's Night: And Other True Tales of Detroit'' (1991).</ref>

Detroit became notorious for violent crime in the 1970s and 1980s. Dozens of violent black street gangs gained control of the city's large drug trade, which began with the heroin epidemic of the 1970s and grew into the larger [[Crack epidemic|crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and early 1990s]]. There were numerous major criminal gangs that were founded in Detroit and dominated the drug trade at various times; most were short-lived. They included The [[Errol Flynns]] (east side), Nasty Flynns (later the NF Bangers) and Black Killers and the drug consortiums of the 1980s such as [[Young Boys Inc.]], Pony Down, Best Friends, [[Black Mafia Family]] and the [[Chambers Brothers (gang)|Chambers Brothers]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Carl S. Taylor|title=Girls, gangs, women, and drugs|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NlpHAAAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Michigan State University Press|page=44}}</ref>  The Young Boys were innovative, opening franchises in other cities, using youth too young to be prosecuted, promoting brand names, and unleashing extreme brutality to frighten away rivals.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ron Chepesiuk|title=The War on Drugs: An International Encyclopedia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=V1rjd3cBI84C&pg=PA269|year=1999|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=269}}</ref>

Several times during the 1970s and 1980s Detroit was named the arson capital of America, and repeatedly the murder capital of America. Often Detroit was listed by FBI crime statistics as the "most dangerous city in America" during this time. Crime rates in Detroit peaked in 1991 at more than 2,700 violent crimes per 100,000 people.<ref name="cus.wayne.edu">[http://www.cus.wayne.edu/content/publications/Detroit%20Crime%20Barometer%20October%202005.pdf Wayne University Center for Urban Studies, October 2005]</ref> Population decline left abandoned buildings that have become magnets for drugs, arson, and other crime.

Around Halloween, a traditional day for pranks in late October, Detroit youth went on a rampage called "[[Devil's Night]]" in the 1980s. A tradition of light-hearted minor vandalism, such as soaping windows, had emerged in the 1930s, but by the 1980s it had become, said Mayor Coleman, "a vision from hell."<ref>Coleman Young and Lonnie Wheeler, ''Hard Stuff: The Autobiography of Mayor Coleman Young'' (1994) p 282</ref>   

The arson primarily took place in the inner city, but surrounding suburbs were often affected as well. The crimes became increasingly more destructive. Over 800 fires were set in the peak year 1984, overwhelming the city's fire department. Hundreds of vacant homes across the city were set ablaze by arsonists. The fires continued to happen but the number was sharply reduced by razing thousands of abandoned houses that often were used to sell drugs as well--5000 in 1989-90 alone. Every year the city mobilizes " Angel's Night," with tens of thousands of volunteers patrolling areas at high risk .<ref>{{cite book|author=Nicholas Rogers|title=Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=stWZ_UDteMIC&pg=PA100|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=98<U+2013>102}}</ref><ref>Zev Chafets, ''Devil's Night and Other True Tales of Detroit'' (1990) ch 1</ref>

Long a major population center, Detroit has been going through a major reduction in population; the city has lost about 60% of its population since the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web |first=Kamelia |last=Angelova  |url =http://www.businessinsider.com/the-incredible-decline-of-detroit-photos-2012-10?op=1 |title =Bleak Photos Capture The Fall Of Detroit |publisher =Business Insider |date =October 2, 2012 |accessdate=February 10, 2013 }}</ref> Detroit reached its population peak in the 1950 census at over 1.8 million people, and decreased in population with each subsequent census; as of the 2010 census, the city has just over 700,000 residents, adding up to a total loss of 60% of the population.<ref name="NYT Census">{{cite news|last=Seelye|first=Katherine Q.|title= Detroit Census Confirms a Desertion Like No Other |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/us/23detroit.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times|date=March 22, 2011|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2211498/Detroits-amazing-transformation-captured-camera-loses-ONE-MILLION-residents-60-years.html#axzz2KX2qavQ5 |title =Derelict Detroit: Gloomy pictures chart the 25-year decline of America's Motor City |publisher =Daily Mail |date =October 1, 2012 |accessdate=February 10, 2013 }}</ref>

[[File:Vanity Ballroom Floor 2010.JPG|thumb|250px|alt=Vanity Ballroom dance floor|Dance floor of the [[Vanity Ballroom Building]] in 2010.]]
Detroit has serious problems with crime; the crime rate is one of the highest in the United States, with a rate of 62.18 per 1,000 residents for property crimes, and 16.73 per 1,000 for violent crimes (compared to national figures of 32 per 1,000 for property crimes and 5 per 1,000 for violent crime in 2008).<ref name="Detroit crime rates and statistics">{{cite web|url=http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/mi/detroit/crime/ |title=Detroit crime rates and statistics |publisher=Neighborhood Scout |accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref> Nearly two-thirds of all murders in Michigan in 2008 occurred in Detroit.<ref name=UCR>{{cite web|url=http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2008/data/table_08.html |title=Offenses Known to Law Enforcement by State by City, 2008 |publisher=Fbi.gov |year=2009 |accessdate=2013-02-06}}</ref> In 2012 Detroit was the most dangerous city in the United States for the fourth year in a row.<ref>{{cite web |first=Daniel |last=Fisher |url =http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2012/10/18/detroit-tops-the-2012-list-of-americas-most-dangerous-cities/ |title =Detroit Tops The 2012 List Of America's Most Dangerous Cities |publisher =Forbes |date =October 18, 2012 |accessdate=April 1, 2013 }}</ref>

====Urban decay====
[[File:The Film Exchange Building (Detroit).jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Film Exchange Building]] in 2012.]]

A significant percentage of housing parcels in the city are vacant, with abandoned lots making up more than half of total residential lots in many large portions of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.detroitparcelsurvey.org/pdf/Detroit_Residential_Parcel_Survey_Presentation.pdf |title =Detroit Residential Parcel Survey |publisher =Detroit Residential Parcel Survey |date =February 2010 |accessdate=April 1, 2013 |page=26}}</ref> With at least 70,000 abandoned buildings, 31,000 empty houses, and 90,000 vacant lots, Detroit has become notorious for its [[Urban decay|urban blight]].<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news|last=Binelli|first=Mark|title=How Detroit Became the World Capital of Staring at Abandoned Old Buildings|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/magazine/how-detroit-became-the-world-capital-of-staring-at-abandoned-old-buildings.html?pagewanted=all|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2012-11-09}}</ref><ref name="wired" />

To attempt to improve stability, there are hopes to concentrate Detroit's remaining population into certain areas to improve the delivery of essential city services  which the city has had significant difficulty providing (policing, fire protection, schooling, trash removal, snow removal, lighting, etc).<ref name="wired" /> 

The average price of homes sold in Detroit in 2012 was $7,500; 47 houses in Detroit were listed for $500 or less, with five properties listed for $1.<ref name="couriermail">{{cite news|last=Koremans|first=Sonja|title=Homes still selling for $1 in Detroit|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/realestate/homes-for-1/story-fnczc1bg-1226559204461|newspaper=The Courier-Mail|date=January 22, 2013|accessdate=April 1, 2013}}</ref> Despite the extremely low price of Detroit properties, most of the properties have been on the market for more than a year as buyers balk at the boarded up, abandoned houses of Detroit.<ref name="couriermail" /> Detroit<U+2019>s unpaid property taxes totaled $17.6 million in 2012.<ref name="couriermail" />
