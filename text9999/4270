'''Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd.''' ('''MLSE''') is a [[professional sports]] and [[commercial real estate]] company based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].  With assets that include franchises in three of the six [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]], it is the largest sports and entertainment company in Canada, and one of the largest in North America.

The primary holdings of the company are its major sports franchises, the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]], [[Toronto Raptors]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] and [[Toronto FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]], as well as the minor league [[Toronto Marlies]] of the [[American Hockey League]] and an [[Toronto USL Pro team|unnamed soccer team]] to be launched in the [[USL PRO]] in 2015.  In addition, it owns the [[Air Canada Centre]], the home arena of the Maple Leafs and Raptors.  MLSE also manages or has invested in several other sports facilities including [[BMO Field]], home of Toronto FC, [[Ricoh Coliseum]], home of the Marlies, [[MasterCard Centre]], the practice facility of the Maple Leafs and Marlies, [[KIA Training Ground]], practice facility for Toronto FC and home of the [[TFC Academy]], and [[Lamport Stadium]].

MLSE was founded by [[Conn Smythe]] in 1931 as Maple Leaf Gardens Limited (MLGL) to act as a [[holding company]] for the Maple Leafs and their planned new arena [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], from which the company got its name.  Smythe transferred his ownership of the Leafs to the company in exchange for shares in MLGL, and sold shares in the holding company to the public to help fund construction of the arena.  While initially primarily a hockey company, with ownership stakes in a number of [[professional ice hockey|minor]] and [[junior hockey]] clubs including the [[Toronto Marlboros]] of the [[Ontario Hockey Association]], the company later branched out to own the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] from the late 1970s to late 1980s, before merging with the Raptors, who were constructing the Air Canada Centre at the time, and adopting their current name in 1998.  Most recently the company launched Toronto FC in 2007.

Over most of its 80 plus years of existence MLSE was a [[public company]].  Following the death of majority owner [[Harold Ballard]] in 1990, [[Steve Stavro]] led a controversial bid to buy the company and take it [[Privately held company|private]].  Most recently, the  [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]] sold their 79.53% share of the company for $1.32 billion to a joint venture between [[Rogers Communications]] and [[Bell Canada]], two of Canada's largest media companies, giving the company an equity value of $1.66 billion and an enterprise value of $2 billion.  (All figures are in [[Canadian dollars]] (CAD) unless otherwise specified.)  Although the company has proven to be very profitable, they have had much less success at producing winning teams.  Of the three major franchises they currently own (Maple Leafs, Raptors and Toronto FC), only the Maple Leafs have ever won a championship, but not since their [[1967 Stanley Cup Finals|1967 Stanley Cup]].  The only other major championship the company has won was the [[74th Grey Cup]] in 1986 by the Tiger-Cats.

==Corporate history==

===Founding===
[[File:Pride at Maple Leaf Gardens.jpg|thumb|left|Maple Leaf Gardens, the former home of the Toronto Maple Leafs, after which MLGL was named]]
The corporation's roots can be traced back to 1927, when [[Conn Smythe]] organized a group of investors to purchase Toronto's premier hockey franchise, the [[Toronto St. Patricks]] of the [[National Hockey League]], which had earned [[Stanley Cup]] championships in [[1917<U+2013>18 NHL season|1918]] (as the [[Toronto Arenas]]) and [[1921<U+2013>22 NHL season|1922]], from a group headed by [[Charles Querrie]].  The club was playing poorly and minority partner [[Jack Bickell]] contacted Smythe about becoming coach of the team.  However, Smythe told Bickell that he was more interested in buying a stake in the team.  Not long after, with the team in trouble financially due to majority owner Querrie having lost a lawsuit to former [[Toronto Blueshirts]] owner [[Eddie Livingstone]], Querrie put the St. Pats up for sale and agreed in principle to sell them for $200,000 to a group that would move the team to [[Philadelphia]].<ref name=thoughages>{{cite web|url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2010/12/01/maple-leafs-owners-through-the-ages/|title=Maple Leafs' owners through the ages|last=Sandler|first=Jeremy|newspaper=[[National Post]]|date=2010-12-01|accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref>  After Bickell contacted Smythe to inform him of the sale, Smythe persuaded Querrie that civic pride was more important than money and put together a syndicate that bought the St. Pats.  Smythe himself invested $10,000 of his own money and his group contributed $75,000 up front and a further $75,000 due 30 days later, with Bickell retaining his $40,000 share in the team.<ref name=thoughages/><ref name=smythe>{{cite web|url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2011/10/21/excerpt-the-lives-of-conn-smythe/|title=The Lives of Conn Smythe: From the Battlefield to Maple Leaf Gardens: A Hockey Icon's Story|year=2011|accessdate=2014-01-11|publisher=[[National Post]]|first=Kelly|last=McParland}}</ref>  The deal was finalized on Valentine's Day,<ref name=smythe/> and the new owners quickly renamed the team the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].<ref name=smytheyoung>{{cite book |last1=Smythe |first1=Conn |author1link=Conn Smythe|last2=Young |first2=Scott |author2link=Scott Young (writer)|title=Conn Smythe: If you can't beat 'em in the alley |year=1981 |publisher=McClelland and Stewart |location=Toronto, Ontario |isbn=0-7710-9078-1}}</ref>{{rp|85<U+2013>86}}  Later that year, Smythe bought the [[junior hockey]] [[Toronto Marlboros]] of the [[Ontario Hockey Association]] to serve as a developmental team for Maple Leafs.<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://www.marlies.ca/history/marlies.asp|title=Marlies history|accessdate=2014-02-17|publisher=Toronto Marlies}}</ref><ref name=timeline>{{cite web|url=http://www.marlies.ca/history/timeline.asp|title=Marlies timeline|accessdate=2014-02-17|publisher=Toronto Marlies}}</ref>

[[File:Tor chi 94.jpg|thumb|The Toronto Maple Leafs, the primary asset of MLGL for many years, play a home game at the Gardens in 1994]]

In 1929, Smythe decided, in the midst of the [[Great Depression]], that the Maple Leafs needed a new arena. Their then home, the [[Arena Gardens]], which they shared with the Marlboros,<ref name=history/> had been built in 1912 and seated just 8,000, which the Maple Leafs were regularly filling. After considering various locations, the site at the corner of Carlton and Church was purchased from [[Eaton's|The T. Eaton Co. Ltd.]] for $350,000,<ref name=smytheyoung/>{{rp|104}} a price said to be $150,000 below market value. A new 12,473 seat (14,550 including standing room) arena was designed by the architectural firm of [[Ross and Macdonald]]. To finance construction, Smythe got backing from [[Sun Life]] for half of the expected $1 million cost<ref name=smytheyoung/>{{rp|103}} and launched Maple Leaf Gardens Limited (MLGL), a management company that would own both the Maple Leafs and the new arena, which was named [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] (MLG).<ref name=smytheyoung/>{{rp|102}} A public offering of shares in MLGL was made at $10 each (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|10|1931}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars),{{inflation-fn|CA}} with a free common share for each five preferred shares purchased.<ref>{{cite news|title=Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited - Prospectus|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail|The Globe]]|date=1931-03-05}}</ref> Ownership of the hockey team was transferred to MLGL in return for shares.

===Minor hockey expansion===
The company has owned numerous [[minor league]] hockey teams over the years, which have served as developmental [[farm team]]s for the Maple Leafs.  A group backed by Smythe and [[Frank Selke]] of the [[Montreal Canadiens]] was awarded an [[American Hockey league]] franchise for [[Rochester, New York]] in July 1956, after a local group could not come up with the $150,000 [[United States dollars|USD]] in capital required by the league.<ref name=eager>{{cite news|last=Marcotte|first=Bob|title=Eager fans embraced arrival of the Rochester Amerks|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20110307/NEWS0204/103070318/Eager-fans-embraced-arrival-Rochester-Amerks|newspaper=Democrat and Chronicle|date=2011-03-07|agency=Gannett Compant|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x795iwiX|archivedate=2011-03-11|location=Rochester, New York|pages=1B,4B}}</ref><ref name=makesit>{{cite news|title=Rochester makes it - Gains AHL franchise|date=1956-07-03|newspaper=[[Toronto Daily Star]]}}</ref><ref name=coffers>{{cite news|title=Sale of Rochester hockey team pads Maple Leaf coffers|date=1966-07-07|newspaper=[[Toronto Daily Star]]|first=Neil|last=MacCarl}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Give Rochester conditional OK on AHL franchise|date=1956-06-20|newspaper=[[Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>  The Leafs and Canadiens would each own 27.5% of the team, with the balance sold to Rochester interests.<ref name=eager /><ref>{{cite news|title=Maple Leafs Seek Farm Club in AHL|date=1959-03-18|newspaper=[[Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>  The team was named the [[Rochester Americans]].

==Ownership==

===Conn Smythe===
[[File:Conn smythe.jpg|thumb|Conn Smythe, founder of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment]]

Although Conn Smythe was the face of MLGL from its founding in 1931, he did not acquire majority ownership of the company until 1947, following a power struggle between directors who supported him as president and those who wanted him replaced with [[Frank J. Selke]]. With the help of a $300,000 loan from Toronto stockbroker and MLGL shareholder [[Percy Gardiner]], and the support of minority partner Jack Bickell, Smythe was able to buy 30,000 shares in MLGL from Gardiner<ref name=powerplay>{{cite news|title=Gardens power plays|date=1995-04-03|newspaper=[[Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> and installed himself as president on 19 November 1947, replacing  Edward Bickle.<ref>{{cite news |title=Baseball's bankroll gone |last=Dunnell|first=Milt|authorlink=Milt Dunnell|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=1965-07-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Hunter |first=Douglas |year=1997 |title=Champions: The Illustrated History of Hockey's Greatest Dynasties. |location=Chicago, Illinois |publisher=Triumph Books |isbn=1-57243-213-6 |page=50}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Smythe is elected Gardens' president|date=1947-11-20|newspaper=[[Toronto Daily Star]]}}</ref>  The loan was paid off in 1960.<ref>{{cite book |title=Centre Ice: The Smythe Family, the Gardens, and the Toronto Maple Leafs Hockey Club |last1=Smythe |first1=Thomas Stafford |last2=Shea |first2=Kevin Shea |publisher=Fenn Publishing Co. |year=2000 |location=Bolton, Ontario, Canada |isbn=1-55168-250-8 |ref=harv|pages=156<U+2013>167}}</ref>  In November 1961 Smythe sold 45,000 of his 50,000 shares to a three-person partnership formed by [[Stafford Smythe]] (Conn Smythe's son), [[Harold Ballard]] and [[John Bassett]], who at the time owned part of the [[Toronto Argonauts]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] and [[Toronto Telegram]], for $2.3 million.  When combined with their own holdings, this gave them 87,000 shares representing 60% of the company.<ref name=thoughages/><ref name=smytheyoung/>{{rp|217}}<ref name=powerplay/><ref name=death>{{cite news|title=Ballard's death laid groundwork|date=2010-12-01|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]}}</ref><ref name=bassettsells/>  Ballard fronted Stafford most of the money for the purchase though a loan he obtained.<ref name=thoughages/><ref name=shakeup>{{cite news|title=Ballard president in shakeup at Gardens|last=Beddoes|first=Dick|authorlink=Dick Beddoes|newspaper=[[Globe and Mail]]|date=1971-10-21}}</ref>  According to several sources, Conn thought the sale was only to his son,<ref name=thoughages/> and was furious when he learned that Ballard and Bassett were his partners. He had hoped that Stafford would keep MLGL for his son, Tommy.<ref name=smytheyoung/>{{rp|217<U+2013>218}}  However, it is unlikely that Stafford could have raised the millions needed for the deal on his own.  Stafford became president of MLGL and governor of the Maple Leafs, with Ballard executive vice president and Bassett chairman of the board.<ref name=powerplay/>

===Harold Ballard, John Bassett and Stafford Smythe===
In March 1966 Conn sold his remaining shares and resigned from the board of directors after a [[Muhammad Ali]] boxing match was scheduled for MLG. He found Ali's refusal to serve in the U.S. Army in the [[Vietnam War]] to be offensive,<ref name=smytheyoung/>{{rp|232}} and said that by accepting the fight, MLGL owners had "put cash ahead of class."<ref>{{cite news |title='Cash rated over class' Conn quits |author=McKee, Ken |work=Toronto Star |date=1966-03-08}}</ref>  Within three years under the new owners, profits at MLGL had tripled to just under $1 million. Ballard negotiated lucrative deals to place advertising throughout the building, and greatly increased the number of seats in the arena.<ref>''Ballard: A Portrait of Canada's Most Controversial Sports Figure'', William Houston, Summerhill Press, 1984, p. 60.</ref>

Following a [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] raid at MLG in 1968, Stafford was charged with income tax evasion, and he and Ballard were accused of illegally taking money from MLGL to pay for renovations of their houses and other personal expenses.  Just before the charges were laid, Bassett argued to the board that Stafford and Ballard should be removed from their posts. Following an 8<U+2013>7 vote of the board of directors on 26 June 1969, Stafford and Ballard were both fired, and Bassett was appointed president of MLGL. However, Bassett did not force Stafford and Ballard to sell their shares, and both men remained on the board.  This proved to be a serious strategic blunder; Stafford was the largest single shareholder in MLGL, and he and Ballard controlled almost half the company's stock between them.  They were thus able to regain control of the board in 1970 and Stafford was once again appointed president.<ref name=powerplay/>  Facing an untenable situation, Bassett sold the 196,200 shares he controlled in MLGL to Stafford and Ballard in September 1971 for $5.4 million, which he used to buy out his partners in the Argos.<ref name=death/><ref name=bassettsells>{{cite news|title=Bassett sells Gardens stock, buys control of Argos|first=Dick|last=Beddoes|authorlink=Dick Beddoes|date=1971-09-02|newspaper=[[Globe and Mail]]}}</ref><ref name=shakeup/> Combined with their 306,295 jointly controlled shares, the transaction gave the Stafford Smythe-Ballard partnership 78% of the stock.<ref name=bassettsells/><ref name=shakeup/>  Ballard would be convicted of 47 charges<ref name=howherold/> and sentenced to three years in a federal penitentiary, but Stafford died in October 1971 of a bleeding ulcer at the age of only 50 just before his trial was scheduled to begin.<ref name=powerplay/><ref name=death/><ref name=repeats/>  Under the terms of Stafford's will, of which Ballard was an [[executor]],<ref name=repeats>{{cite news|title=History repeats itself&nbsp;... almost|date=1999-03-22|last=Tedesco|first=Theresa|newspaper=[[National Post]]}}</ref> each partner was allowed to buy the other's shares upon their death.

===Harold Ballard===
In 1966 Ballard set up a family [[holding company]], named Harold E. Ballard Ltd.

After getting into financial difficulty, Harold reached an agreement with [[Molson Brewery]] in November 1980, which at the time owned the [[Montreal Canadiens]], for the company to cover his debt financing charges on a loan of $8.8 million for 10 years in exchange for an option to purchase a 19.9% block of shares in MLGL from HEBL and a right of first refusal on the rest of HEBL's shares.<ref name=powerplay/><ref name=molsonnets/><ref name=molsonpurchase/>  The NHL did not learn of the deal until the late 1980s.<ref name=molsonnets/>  In 1982 he offered to sell the company for $50 million, with the arena alone reportedly valued at $11 million, though a stockholders' report the following year placed the value of MLGL at $23.5 million.<ref name=bigmoney/><ref name=price/>  When Harold transferred ownership of his personal real estate holdings, which were valued at $2.52 million, to HEBL in January 1989, he acquired 4 newly issued common shares in the company plus a promise of a further $896,472 rather than cash.<ref name=howherold/><ref name=follies/><ref name=faceoffbrewing/>  Mary Elizabeth sold her stake in HEBL to her father for $15.5 million in January 1989,<ref name=familyaffair/><ref name=faceoffbrewing/> after originally having a deal to sell the stake to Don Giffin,<ref name=follies/> while Harold Jr. sold his back to HEBL for $21 million in June of the same year.<ref name=powerplay/><ref name=follies/><ref name=missdeadline/><ref name=faceoffbrewing/>  Harold secured a loan from Molson for the full amount of his buyout of Mary Elizabeth, using the 34 acquired shares in HEBL as security.<ref name=missdeadline>{{cite news|title=Harold E.

As part of the sale, two [[numbered companies]] were created to jointly hold stock.  Following the restructuring, the ownership hierarchy of MLSE was:<ref name="crtc-mlse" />
* 8047286 Canada Inc. (Rogers/Bell [[joint venture|joint]] holding company) <U+2013> 75%
** [[Rogers Communications]] &ndash; 50% (net ownership 37.5%)
** 7680147 Canada Inc. (Bell holding company) &ndash; 50%
*** [[Bell Canada|Bell Canada Enterprises]] &ndash; 74.67% (net ownership 28%)
*** BCE Master Trust Fund (investment fund of Bell's pension plan) &ndash; 25.33% (net ownership 9.5%)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/892971/bell-acquires-ownership-position-in-maple-leaf-sports-and-entertainment-mlse|title=Bell acquires ownership position in Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment - MLSE|author=[[BCE Inc.]]|date=2011-12-09|accessdate=2011-12-09}}</ref>
* Kilmer Sports (holding company of [[Larry Tanenbaum]]) &ndash; 25%

This ownership structure ensures that, at the shareholder level, Rogers and Bell vote their overall 75% interest in the company together and thus decisions on the management of the company must be made by consensus of the two. (If Rogers and Bell owned their interests directly, either Rogers or Bell could be overruled by its competitor in combination with Tanenbaum.) As such, Rogers and Bell have agreed that their previously four of six (now six of eight) directors on the MLSE board will always vote together, and thus that any disagreements between the two companies will be settled privately without the involvement of Tanenbaum.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/leafs-beat/mlse-board-expected-to-undergo-major-change-after-sale-is-finalized/article4426208/|title=MLSE board expected to undergo major change after sale is finalized|first=David|last=Shoalts|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=2012-07-18|accessdate=2013-03-06|location=Toronto}}</ref><ref name=board />  Bell has indicated that the involvement of Bell's pension fund is, at least in part, intended to ensure Bell can retain its existing 18% interest in the [[Montreal Canadiens]], as NHL rules prevent any shareholder that owns more than 30% of a team from holding an ownership position in any other team.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/bell-to-keep-canadiens-stake-1.997652|title=Bell to keep Canadiens stake|author=[[The Canadian Press]]|work=[[CBC.ca]]|date=2011-12-09|accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref>
