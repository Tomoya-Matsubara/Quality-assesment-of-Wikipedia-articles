Since the [[East<U+2013>West Schism]] of 1054, the Eastern Church has taken the adjective "Orthodox" as its distinctive epithet, and the Western Church in communion with the [[Holy See]] has similarly taken "Catholic", keeping that description also after the 16th-century [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], when those that ceased to be in communion became known as Protestants.<ref>"catholic, adj. and n." [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Online. Oxford University Press, June 2014. Web. 7 August 2014. Excerpt: "After the separation of East and West 'Catholic' was assumed as its descriptive epithet by the Western or Latin Church, as 'Orthodox' was by the Eastern or Greek. At the Reformation the term 'Catholic' was claimed as its exclusive right by the body remaining under the Roman obedience, in opposition to the 'Protestant' or 'Reformed' National Churches. These, however, also retained the term, giving it, for the most part, a wider and more ideal or absolute sense, as the attribute of no single community, but only of the whole communion of the saved and saintly in all churches and ages. In England, it was claimed that the Church, even as Reformed, was the national branch of the 'Catholic Church' in its proper historical sense."

The Catholic Church is led by clergy who have received the sacrament of [[Catholic Church#Sacraments at the service of communion|Holy Orders]]. There are three levels of clergy, the episcopate (bishops), whose members are usually given a geographical area to lead called a diocese or eparchy; the presbyterate (priests), who usually serve the bishops by leading local parishes; and the diaconate (deacons), who serve the bishops and priests in a variety of ministerial roles. Ultimately leading the entire Catholic Church is the Bishop of Rome, called the Pope. In parallel to the diocesan structure are a variety of religious orders and institutions that function autonomously, often subject only to the authority of the Pope, though sometimes subject to the local bishop. Most religious orders only have male or female members but some have both. Additionally, lay members aid many liturgical functions during worship services.

==Doctrine==
{{Main|Catholic doctrine|Catholic theology|Biblical canon}}

Catholic doctrine has developed over the centuries, reflecting direct teachings of early Christians, formal definitions of [[Heresy in Christianity|heretical]] and orthodox beliefs by [[ecumenical councils]] and in [[papal bull]]s, and theological debate by scholars. The Church believes that it is continually guided by the Holy Spirit as it discerns new theological issues and is protected [[Infallibility of the Church|infallibly]] from falling into doctrinal error when a firm decision on an issue is reached.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2A.HTM|work=Catechism of the Catholic Church|publisher=Vatican|accessdate=28 April 2011|title=The teaching office|quote=889 in order to preserve the Church in the purity of the faith handed on by the apostles, Christ who is the Truth willed to confer on her a share in his own infallibility.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Second Vatican Council|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html|work=Lumen Gentium|publisher=Vatican|accessdate=24 July 2010|title=Chapter III, paragraph 25|quote=by the light of the Holy Spirit&nbsp;... vigilantly warding off any errors that threaten their flock.}}</ref>

===Nature of God===
[[File:Fridolin Leiber - Holy Trinity.jpg|thumb|right|A symbolic image illustrating the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, by Fridolin Leiber.]]
The Catholic Church holds that there is one eternal God, who exists as a [[perichoresis|mutual indwelling]] of three [[Hypostasis|Hypostases]], or Persons: [[God the Father#Christianity|God the Father]]; [[God the Son]]; and [[Holy Spirit|God the Holy Spirit]], which together are called the "[[Holy Trinity]]".<ref name=232_252>{{CCC|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p2.htm|pp=232|end=237; 252|accessdate=21 March 2015}}</ref>

Catholics believe that Jesus Christ is the Second Person of the Trinity, God the Son. In an event known as the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], through the power of the Holy Spirit, God became united with human nature through the conception of Christ in the womb of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]. Christ therefore is both fully divine and fully human, including possessing a human [[soul]]. It is taught that Christ's mission on earth included giving people his teachings and providing his example for them to follow as recorded in the four Gospels.<ref name="McGrath">McGrath, pp. 4<U+2013>6.</ref> Jesus is believed to have remained sinless while on earth, and to have been allowed himself to be unjustly executed by [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], as sacrifice of himself to reconcile God to humanity; this reconciliation is known as the [[Paschal Mystery]].<ref>{{CCC|595|pp_range="JESUS CHRIST SUFFERED UNDER PONTIUS PILATE, WAS CRUCIFIED, DIED, AND WAS BURIED"|December 30, 2014}}</ref> The Greek term "Christ" and the Hebrew "Messiah" both mean "anointed one", referring to the Christian belief that Jesus' death and resurrection are the fulfilment of the Old Testament's [[Jesus and messianic prophecy|messianic prophecies]].<ref name="Kreeft71">Kreeft, pp. 71<U+2013>72</ref>

The liturgy of the sacrament of the [[Eucharist]], called the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in the West and [[Divine Liturgy]] or other names in the East, is the principal liturgy of the Catholic Church.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P41.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1362<U+2013>1364]</ref> This is because it is considered the propitiatory sacrifice of Christ himself.<ref name="scborromeo.org">{{CCC|pp=1367|base_url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/|publisher=scborromeo.org|url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/1367.htm|}}</ref> The most widely used is the [[Roman Rite]], usually in its [[Mass of Paul VI|ordinary form]] promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]] in 1969, but also in its authorised [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite|extraordinary form]], the [[Tridentine Mass]] as in the 1962 edition of the [[Roman Missal]].

The Roman Rite is the most common [[Catholic liturgical rites|rite of worship]] used by the Catholic Church. Its use is found worldwide, originating in Rome and spreading throughout Europe, influencing and eventually supplanting local rites.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FYpD7C7__TYC&pg=PA3&dq=roman+rite&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Z60VVbuWF8LZsATKxYKQCw&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=roman%20rite&f=false|title=The Restoration and Organic Development of the Roman Rite|first=Laszlo|last=Dobszay|chapter=3|pp=3<U+2013>5|date=2010|publisher=T&T Clark International|city=New York|isbn=9780567033857}}</ref> The present ordinary form of Mass in the Roman Rite, found in the post-1969 editions of the [[Roman Missal]], is usually celebrated in the local [[vernacular]] language, using an officially approved translation from the original text in [[Latin]]. An outline of its major liturgical elements can be found in the side bar.

In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI affirmed the continued use of the [[1962 Roman Missal]] as an [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]] ("a ''Forma extraordinaria''"), speaking of it also as an ''usus antiquior'' (older use), and issued new permissive norms for its employment.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html Letter of Pope Benedict XVI to bishops on 7 July 2007] "The last version of the Missale Romanum prior to the Council, which was published with the authority of Pope John XXIII in 1962 and used during the Council, will now be able to be used as a Forma extraordinaria of the liturgical celebration.  ... As for the use of the 1962 Missal as a Forma extraordinaria of the liturgy of the Mass, I would like to draw attention to the fact that this Missal was never juridically abrogated and, consequently, in principle, was always permitted." <U+2014> Pope Benedict XVI</ref> An instruction issued four years later spoke of the two forms or usages of the Roman Rite approved by the pope as the ordinary form and the extraordinary form ("the ''forma ordinaria''" and "the ''forma extraordinaria''").<ref name="Universae Ecclesiae">{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_commissions/ecclsdei/documents/rc_com_ecclsdei_doc_20110430_istr-universae-ecclesiae_en.html|title=Instruction on the application of the Apostolic Letter Summorum Pontificum of His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI given Motu Proprio|work=vatican.va}}</ref>

The 1962 edition of the Roman Missal, published a few months before the [[Second Vatican Council]] opened, was the last that presented the Mass as standardised in 1570 by [[Pope Pius V]] at the request of the [[Council of Trent]] and that is therefore known as the Tridentine Mass.<ref name=Kreeft326 /> Pope Pius V's Roman Missal was subjected to minor revisions by [[Pope Clement VIII]] in 1604, [[Pope Urban VIII]] in 1634, [[Pope Pius X]] in 1911, [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1955, and [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1962. Each successive edition was the ordinary form of the Roman Rite Mass until superseded by a later edition. When the 1962 edition was superseded by that of Paul VI, promulgated in 1969, its continued use at first required permission from bishops;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/ritesrituals/tridentinemass_1.shtml|title=BBC Religions: What is the Tridentine Mass?|date=23 June 2009|accessdate=27 March 2015}}</ref> but [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s 2007 [[motu proprio]] ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'' allowed free use of it for Mass celebrated without a congregation and authorised parish priests to permit, under certain conditions, its use even at public Masses.

The [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] share common patrimony and liturgical rites as there counterparts including [[Eastern Orthodox]] and other [[Eastern Christian]] who are no longer in communion with the Holy See; these include churches that historically developed in Russia, Caucasus, the Balkans, North Eastern Africa, India and the Middle East.

{{Main|Sacraments of the Catholic Church}}

The Catholic Church teaches that it was entrusted with [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|seven sacraments]] that were instituted by Christ.  The number and nature of the sacraments were defined by several [[ecumenical council]]s, most recently the Council of Trent.<ref name=1113_14>{{CCC|pp=1113|pp_range=1113<U+2013>1114, 1117|accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|Other councils that addressed the sacraments include the [[Second Council of Lyon]] (1274); [[Council of Florence]] (1439); as well as the [[Council of Trent]] (1547)<ref name=1113_14 />|}} These are [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation]], the [[Eucharist]], [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Penance]], [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Anointing of the Sick]] (formerly called Extreme Unction, one of the "[[Last Rites]]"), [[Holy Orders]] and [[Catholic marriage|Holy Matrimony]]. Sacraments are visible rituals that Catholics see as signs of God's presence and effective channels of God's [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] to all those who receive them with the proper disposition (''[[ex opere operato]]'').<ref>Kreeft, pp. 298<U+2013>299</ref> The Catechism of the Catholic Church categorises the sacraments into three groups, the "sacraments of Christian initiation", "sacraments of healing" and "sacraments at the service of communion and the mission of the faithful". These groups broadly reflect the stages of people's natural and spiritual lives which each sacrament is intended to serve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3E.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1210<U+2013>1211 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref>

The liturgies of the sacraments are central to the church's mission.  According to the catechism:

{{blockquote|In the liturgy of the New Covenant every liturgical action, especially the celebration of the Eucharist and the sacraments, is an encounter between Christ and the Church. The liturgical assembly derives its unity from the "communion of the Holy Spirit" who gathers the children of God into the one Body of Christ. This assembly transcends racial, cultural, social - indeed, all human affinities.<ref>{{CCC|1097|21 November 2014}}</ref>|}}

According to church doctrine, the sacraments of the church require the proper form, matter, and intent to be validly celebrated.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Sacraments}}</ref>  In addition, the [[Canon Law]]s for both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Church govern who may licitly celebrate certain sacraments, as well as strict rules about who may receive the sacraments.<ref name=CoCC291>{{cite web|title=''CoCC'' 291|publisher=Vatican.va|accessdate=27 March 2015|quote=To receive Holy Communion one must be fully incorporated into the Catholic Church and be in the state of grace, that is, not conscious of being in mortal sin. Anyone who is conscious of having committed a grave sin must first receive the sacrament of Reconciliation before going to Communion. Also important for those receiving Holy Communion are a spirit of recollection and prayer, observance of the fast prescribed by the Church, and an appropriate disposition of the body (gestures and dress) as a sign of respect for Christ.}}</ref><!--<ref name="CCC, 1399" />-->  Notably, because the Church teaches that Christ is [[real presence#Catholic and Orthodox|present]] in the Eucharist,<ref name="Kreeft326">Kreeft, p. 326</ref> those who are conscious of being in a state of mortal sin are forbidden to receive the sacrament until they have received absolution through the [[sacrament of Reconciliation]] (Penance).<ref name="Kreeft331"/> Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating for at least an hour before receiving the sacrament.<ref name="Kreeft331">Kreeft, p. 331</ref> Non-Catholics such are ordinarily prohibitted from receiving the Eucharist as well.<ref name=CoCC291 /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P42.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1400-1401 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref>

Catholics, even if they were in danger of death and unable to approach a Catholic minister, may not ask for the sacraments of the Eucharist, penance or anointing of the sick from someone, such as a Protestant minister, who is not known to be validly ordained in line with Catholic teaching on ordination.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/general-docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_19930325_directory_en.html Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms of Ecumenism, 132]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P42.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1400 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> Likewise, even in grave and pressing need, Catholic ministers may not administer these sacraments to those who do not manifest Catholic faith in the sacrament. In relation to the churches of Eastern Christianity not in communion with the Holy See, the Catholic Church is less restrictive, declaring that "a certain ''communion in sacris'', and so in the Eucharist, given suitable circumstances and the approval of Church authority, is not merely possible but is encouraged."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P42.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1399 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref>

=====Eucharist=====
For Catholics, the Eucharist is the sacrament which completes Christian initiation.  It is described as "the source and summit of the Christian life".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3W.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1322<U+2014>24 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> The ceremony in which a Catholic first receives the Eucharist is known as [[First Communion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/activities/view.cfm?id=601 |title=Catholic Activity: Preparing for First Holy Communion |publisher=Catholicculture.org |accessdate=25 March 2015}}</ref>

The Eucharistic celebration, also called the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or [[Divine liturgy]], includes prayers and scriptural readings, as well as an offering of bread and wine, which are brought to the [[altar]] and [[consecration#Eucharist|consecrated]] by the priest to become the body and the blood of Jesus Christ, a change called [[transubstantiation]].<ref>{{Cite CE1913 | wstitle = The Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist | first = Joseph | last = Pohle }}</ref><ref group=note>For an outline of the Eucharistic liturgy in the Roman Rite, see the [[Catholic Church#Roman Rite of Mass|side bar]] in the "Worship and liturgy".</ref> The [[words of consecration]] reflect the words spoken by Jesus during the [[Last Supper]], where Christ offered his body and blood to his Apostles the night before his crucifixion. The sacrament re-presents (makes present) the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P41.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1365<U+2013>1372 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=30 June 2011|quote='''1365''' Because it is the memorial of Christ's Passover, the Eucharist is also a sacrifice, thus, in the ritual text of the Mass, the priest asks of the congregation present, "Pray, brothers and sisters, that this my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty Father." the sacrificial character of the Eucharist is manifested in the very words of institution: "This is my body which is given for you" and "This cup which is poured out for you is the New Covenant in my blood." [Lk 22:19-20.] In the Eucharist Christ gives us the very body which he gave up for us on the cross, the very blood which he "poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." [Mt 26:28.]}}</ref> and perpetuates it.  Christ's death and resurrection gives grace through the sacrament that unites the faithful with Christ and one another, remits venial sin, and aids against committing moral sin (though mortal sin itself is forgiven through the sacrament of penance).<ref name=ccc1392>{{CCC|pp=1392|end=95|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>

====Sacraments of healing====
The two sacraments of healing are the [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Sacrament of Penance]] and [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Anointing of the Sick]].

The Sacrament of Penance (also called Reconciliation, Forgiveness, Confession, and Conversion<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Sacraments%20of%20Healing |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 296 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref>) exists for the conversion of those who, after baptism, separate themselves from Christ by sin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Sacraments%20of%20Healing |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 297 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> Essential to this sacrament are acts both by the sinner (examination of conscience, contrition with a determination not to sin again, confession to a priest, and performance of some act to repair the damage caused by sin) and by the priest (determination of the act of reparation to be performed and [[absolution]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Sacraments%20of%20Healing |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 302<U+2013>303 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> Serious sins ([[mortal sin]]s) must be confessed within at most a year and always before receiving Holy Communion, while confession of [[venial sin]]s also is recommended.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Sacraments%20of%20Healing |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 304<U+2013>306 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> The priest is bound under the severest penalties to maintain the "[[seal of confession]]", absolute secrecy about any sins revealed to him in confession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Sacraments%20of%20Healing |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 309 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref>

=====Anointing of the Sick=====
[[File:Extreme Unction Rogier Van der Weyden.jpg|right|upright|thumb|A painting of the Anointing of the Sick being administered by a priest during the last rites.]]
While chrism is used only for the three sacraments that cannot be repeated, a different oil is used by a priest or bishop to bless a Catholic who, because of illness or old age, has begun to be in danger of death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Sacraments%20of%20Healing |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 316 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> This sacrament, known as Anointing of the Sick, is believed to give comfort, peace, courage and, if the sick person is unable to make a confession, even forgiveness of sins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Sacraments%20of%20Healing |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 319 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref>

The sacrament is also referred to as ''Unction'', and in the past as ''Extreme Unction'', and it is one of the three sacraments that constitute the [[last rites]], together with Penance and [[Viaticum]] (Eucharist).<ref>{{Cite CE1913| wstitle = Extreme Unction | first = Patrick | last = Toner | accessdate = 29 March 2015}}</ref>

====Sacraments at the service of communion====
According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church there are two sacraments of [[Koinonia|communion]] directed towards the salvation of others: priesthood and marriage.<ref name=1534_>{{CCC|1534|30 July 2014|set_page=p2s2c3.htm}}</ref><!--experiment with template:CCC, original ref here:<ref>CCC 1534</ref>--> Within the general vocation to be a Christian, these two sacraments ''consecrate'' to specific mission or [[vocation]] among the people of God.

=====Matrimony=====
{{Anchor|Sacrament of marriage}}
{{main|Sacrament of marriage}}
{{See also|Catholic Church#Sexual morality}}

The Catholic Church teaches that marriage is a social and spiritual bond between a man and a woman, ordered towards the good of the spouses and procreation of children; according to [[Catholic teachings on sexual morality]], it is the only appropriate context for sexual activity. A Catholic marriage, or any marriage between baptised individuals of any Christian denomination, is viewed as a sacrament. A sacramental marriage, once consummated, cannot be dissolved except by death.<ref>{{CCC|1601|15 November 2014|pp_range=1601,1614|quote=The matrimonial covenant, by which a man and a woman establish between themselves a partnership of the whole of life, is by its nature ordered toward the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of offspring; this covenant between baptised persons has been raised by Christ the Lord to the dignity of a sacrament.}}</ref>{{refn|Marriages involving unbaptised individuals are considered valid, but not sacramental.

The church does not recognise divorce as ending a valid marriage and allows state recognised divorce only as a means of protecting the property and well being of the spouses and any children.  However, failure to observe the Church's regulations, as well as defects applicable to all marriages, may be grounds for a church declaration of the invalidity of a marriage, a declaration usually referred to as an [[annulment (Catholic Church)|annulment]].<ref name="annulment">{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P53.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1629 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref>  Remarriage following a divorce is not permitted unless the prior marriage was declared invalid.<ref name="annulment"/>

==Social and cultural issues==
{{Main|Catholic social teaching|Catholicism and sexuality|Criticism of the Catholic Church}}
Catholic teaching regarding most social issues involves maintaining bodily integrity. [[Catholic social teaching]], reflecting the concern Jesus showed for the impoverished, places a heavy emphasis on the [[corporal works of mercy]] and the [[spiritual works of mercy]], namely the support and concern for the sick, the poor and the afflicted.<ref>{{Cite CE1913| wstitle = Corporal and Spiritual Works of Mercy | first = Joseph | last = Delany | accessdate = 3 March 2015}}</ref><ref name="Compendium of the CCC, 388">{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#Mans%20Vocation:%20Life%20in%20the%20Spirit |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 388 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> Church teaching calls for a preferential [[option for the poor]] while canon law prescribes that "The Christian faithful are also obliged to promote [[social justice]] and, mindful of the precept of the Lord, to assist the poor."<ref name=Cann22>

Catholic teaching regarding sexuality calls for a practice of [[chastity]], with a focus on maintaining the spiritual and bodily integrity of the human person.  Marriage is considered the only appropriate context for sexual activity.<ref name=2337_>{{CCC|2337|17 November 2014|pp_range=2337,2349|quote= "People should cultivate [chastity] in the way that is suited to their state of life. Some profess virginity or consecrated celibacy which enables them to give themselves to God alone with an undivided heart in a remarkable manner. Others live in the way prescribed for all by the moral law, whether they are married or single." (CDF, ''[[Persona humana]]'' 11.) Married people are called to live conjugal chastity; others practice chastity in continence: "There are three forms of the virtue of chastity: the first is that of spouses, the second that of widows, and the third that of virgins. We do not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others. . . . This is what makes for the richness of the discipline of the Church." (St. Ambrose, De viduis 4,23:PL 16,255A.)|}}</ref> Church teachings about sexuality have become an issue of increasing controversy, especially after the close of the Second Vatican Council, due to changing cultural attitudes in the Western world described as the [[sexual revolution]].

===Sexual morality===
{{Anchor|chastity and marriage}}
{{See also|Catholic Church#Sacrament of marriage}}
{{main|Catholic teachings on sexual morality|Marriage (Catholic Church)|}}
Sexuality is considered integral to a person's identity and ability to form lasting relationships. The Catholic Church calls all members to live chastely according to their state in life.  Chastity includes temperance, self-mastery, personal and cultural growth, and grace. It requires refraining from lust, masturbation, fornication, pornography, prostitution and, especially, rape.  Chastity for those who are not married requires living in continence, abstaining from sexual activity; those who are married are called to conjugal chastity.<ref>{{CCC|2332|17 November 2014|pp_range=Part 3,Section 2,Chapter 2, Article: THE SIXTH COMMANDMENT|quote='''2332:''' Sexuality affects all aspects of the human person in the unity of his body and soul. It especially concerns affectivity, the capacity to love and to procreate, and in a more general way the aptitude for forming bonds of communion with others.}}</ref> In the church's teaching, sexual activity is reserved to married couples, whether in a sacramental marriage among Christians, or in a [[natural marriage]] among those who are unbaptized. Even in romantic relationships, particularly [[engagement to marriage]], partners are called to practice continence, in order to test mutual respect and fidelity.<ref>{{CCC|2348|20 December 2014|end=50}}</ref>

Chastity in marriage requires in particular conjugal fidelity and protecting the fecundity of marriage.  The couple must foster trust and honesty as well as spiritual and physical intimacy.  Sexual activity must always be open to the possibility of life;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diocesehelena.org/offices-and-ministries/pastoral-renewal-services/fertility-awareness/church-teaching-about-contraception/ |title=Church teaching about contraception |publisher=[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Helena]] |accessdate=19 December 2014}}</ref> the church calls this the procreative significance.

====Divorce and declarations of nullity====
{{main|Annulment (Catholic Church)|}}
{{further|Divorce law by country}}
Canon law makes no provision for divorce among baptised individuals, as a valid sacramental marriage is considered to be a lifelong bond.<ref>{{CCC|1640|15 November 2014|quote=Thus the marriage bond has been established by God himself in such a way that a marriage concluded and consummated between baptized persons can never be dissolved. This bond, which results from the free human act of the spouses and their consummation of the marriage, is a reality, henceforth irrevocable, and gives rise to a covenant guaranteed by God's fidelity. The Church does not have the power to contravene this disposition of divine wisdom. (Cf. [[Code of Canon Law]] 1983, can. [http://www.catholicdoors.com/misc/marriage/canonlaw.htm 1141])|}}</ref>  However, a declaration of nullity may be granted when proof is produced that essential conditions for contracting a valid marriage were absent from the beginning <U+2014> in other words, that the marriage was not valid due to some impediment. A declaration of nullity, commonly called an annulment, is a judgement on the part of an [[ecclesiastical tribunal]] determining that a marriage was invalidly attempted.<ref>{{CCC|pp=1625|end=32|accessdate=15 November 2014|quote=For this reason (or for other reasons that render the marriage null and void) the Church, after an examination of the situation by the competent ecclesiastical tribunal, can declare the nullity of a marriage, i.e., that the marriage never existed.

{{Main|Christian views on contraception#Catholicism}}
{{Seealso2|[[Catholic Church and HIV/AIDS]]|[[Religious response to assisted reproductive technology#Catholicism|Catholic response to assisted reproductive technology]]}}

The church teaches that [[sexual intercourse]] should only take place between a married man and woman, and should be without the use of [[birth control]] or [[contraception]].  In his encyclical ''[[Humanae vitae]]''<ref name="humanae">{{cite web|last=Paul VI|first=Pope|title=Humanae vitae|publisher=Vatican|year=1968|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html|accessdate=2 February 2008}}</ref> (1968), [[Pope Paul VI]] firmly rejected all contraception, thus contradicting dissenters in the Church that saw the [[birth control pill]] as an ethically justifiable method of contraception, though he permitted the regulation of births by means of [[natural family planning]]. This teaching was continued especially by [[John Paul II]] in his encyclical ''[[Evangelium Vitae]]'', where he clarified the Church's position on contraception, [[Catholic Church and abortion|abortion]] and [[euthanasia]] by condemning them as part of a "culture of death" and calling instead for a "[[culture of life]]".<ref name="Bokenkotter493">Bokenkotter, p. 27, p. 154, pp. 493<U+2013>494</ref>

====Homosexuality====
{{Main|Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism}}

The Catholic Church also teaches that "homosexual acts" are "contrary to the natural law", and thus sinful, but that persons experiencing homosexual tendencies must be accorded respect and dignity.<ref name=2357_2359>{{CCC|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm|pp=2357|end=2359 |accessdate=5 February 2014}}</ref> According to the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'',

{{quote|text=The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided<U+2026>.

Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.<ref name=2358_59>{{CCC|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm |pp=2358|end=59 |accessdate=5 February 2014}}</ref>}}

This part of the ''Catechism'' was quoted by [[Pope Francis]] in a 2013 press interview in which he remarked, when asked about an individual:

{{quote|text=I think that when you encounter a person like this [the individual he was asked about], you must make a distinction between the fact of a person being gay from the fact of being a lobby, because lobbies, all are not good.

In the 1990s and 2000s, the issue of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy and other church members became the subject of civil litigation, criminal prosecution, media coverage and public debate in [[Roman Catholic sex abuse cases by country|countries around the world]]. The Catholic Church was criticised for its handling of abuse complaints when it became known that some bishops had shielded accused priests, transferring them to other pastoral assignments where some continued to commit sexual offences. In response to the scandal, formal procedures have been established to help prevent abuse, encourage the reporting of any abuse that occurs and to handle such reports promptly, although groups representing victims have disputed their effectiveness.<ref>{{cite news|author=David Willey |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-10645748 |title=Vatican 'speeds up' abuse cases |work=BBC News |date=15 July 2010 |accessdate=28 October 2010}}</ref>

<!--See corresponding sections in the body of the history section for sources-->
The Christian religion is based on the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]], who lived and preached in the 1st century AD in the province of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Catholic theology|Catholic doctrine]] teaches that the contemporary Catholic Church is the continuation of this early [[Christian Church|Christian community]] established by Jesus.<ref name="Catholic News Service" /> Christianity spread throughout the early Roman Empire, despite persecutions due to conflicts with the pagan state religion. [[Emperor Constantine]] legalised the practice of Christianity in 313, and it became the state religion in 380. Germanic invaders of Roman territory in the 5th and 6th centuries, many of whom had previously adopted [[Arian Christianity]], eventually adopted Catholicism to ally themselves with the papacy and the monasteries.

In the 7th and 8th centuries, expanding [[Muslim conquests]] following the advent of [[Islam]] led to an Arab domination of the Mediterranean that severed political connections between that area and northern Europe, and weakened cultural connections between Rome and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Conflicts involving authority in the church, particularly the authority of the Bishop of Rome finally culminated in the [[East<U+2013>West Schism]] in the 11th century, splitting the Church into the Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Churches. Earlier splits within the Church occurred after the [[Council of Ephesus]] (431) and the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451). However, a few Eastern Churches remained in [[communion (Christian)|communion]] with Rome, and portions of some others established communion in the 1400s and later, forming what are called the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]].

Early monasteries throughout Europe helped preserve Greek and Roman [[classical civilisation]]. The Church eventually became the dominant influence in Western civilisation into the modern age. Many [[Renaissance]] figures were sponsored by the church. The 16th century, however, began to see challenges to the Church, in particular to its religious authority, by figures in the [[Protestant Reformation]], as well as in the 17th century by secular intellectuals in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Concurrently, Spanish and Portuguese explorers and missionaries spread the Church's influence through Africa, Asia, and the New World.

In 1870, the [[First Vatican Council]] declared the dogma of [[papal infallibility]]. Also in 1870, the [[Kingdom of Italy]] annexed the city of Rome, the last portion of the [[Papal States]] to be incorporated in the new nation. In the 20th century, the church endured a massive backlash at the hands of anti-clerical governments around the world, including Mexico and Spain, where thousands of clerics and laypersons were persecuted or executed. During the Second World War, the Church condemned Nazism, and protected hundreds of thousands of Jews from the [[Holocaust]]; its efforts, however, have been criticised as potentially inadequate. After the war, freedom of religion was severely restricted in the [[Communist]] countries newly aligned with the [[Soviet Union]], several of which had large Catholic populations.

In the 1960s, the [[Second Vatican Council]] led to several controversial reforms of the church liturgy and practices, an effort descried as "opening the windows" by defenders, but leading to harsh criticism in several conservative circles. In the face of increased criticism from both within and without, the Church has upheld or reaffirmed at various times controversial doctrinal positions regarding sexuality and gender, including limiting clergy to males, and moral exhortations against [[abortion]], [[contraception]], [[Human sexual activity#Sex outside of marriage|sexual activity]] outside of marriage, remarriage following [[divorce]] without [[annulment]], and against [[homosexual marriage]].

In considering this point, it will be well to begin with the third century, when references to it become frequent, and work backwards from this point. In the middle of the third century St. Cyprian expressly terms the Roman See the Chair of St. Peter, saying that Cornelius has succeeded to "the place of Fabian which is the place of Peter" (Ep 55:8; cf. 59:14). Firmilian of Caesarea notices that Stephen claimed to decide the controversy regarding rebaptism on the ground that he held the succession from Peter (Cyprian, Ep. 75:17). He does not deny the claim: yet certainly, had he been able, he would have done so. Thus in 250 the Roman episcopate of Peter was admitted by those best able to know the truth, not merely at Rome but in the churches of Africa and of Asia Minor. In the first quarter of the century (about 220) Tertullian (De Pud. 21) mentions Callistus's claim that Peter's power to forgive sins had descended in a special manner to him. Had the Roman Church been merely founded by Peter and not reckoned him as its first bishop, there could have been no ground for such a contention. Tertullian, like Firmilian, had every motive to deny the claim. Moreover, he had himself resided at Rome, and would have been well aware if the idea of a Roman episcopate of Peter had been, as is contended by its opponents, a novelty dating from the first years of the third century, supplanting the older tradition according to which Peter and Paul were co-founders, and Linus first bishop. About the same period, Hippolytus (for Lightfoot is surely right in holding him to be the author of the first part of the "Liberian Catalogue" <U+2014> "Clement of Rome", 1:259) reckons Peter in the list of Roman bishops...."<ref name=JoyceCE1913 />|}} Others say that the institution of the papacy is not dependent on the idea that Peter was Bishop of Rome or even on his ever having been in Rome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.com/tracts/was-peter-in-rome|title=Was Peter in Rome?|publisher=Catholic Answers|date=10 August 2004|quote=if Peter never made it to the capital, he still could have been the first pope, since one of his successors could have been the first holder of that office to settle in Rome.

===Antiquity and Roman Empire===
{{Main|Early centers of Christianity|List of Christian heresies}}
Conditions in the Roman Empire facilitated the spread of new ideas. The empire's well-defined network of roads and waterways facilitated travel, and the ''[[Pax Romana]]'' made travelling safe. The empire encouraged the spread of a common culture with Greek roots, which allowed ideas to be more easily expressed and understood.<ref name=bokenkotter24>Bokenkotter, p. 24.</ref>

Unlike most religions in the Roman Empire, however, Christianity required its adherents to renounce all other gods, a practice adopted from Judaism (see [[Idolatry]]). The Christians' refusal to join pagan celebrations meant they were unable to participate in much of public life, which caused non-Christians<U+2014>including government authorities<U+2014>to fear that the Christians were angering the gods and thereby threatening the peace and prosperity of the Empire. The [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|resulting persecutions]] were a defining feature of Christian self-understanding until Christianity was legalised in the 4th century.<ref name=macculloch155and164>MacCulloch, ''Christianity'', pp. 155<U+2013>159, 164.</ref>

[[File:Basilica di San Pietro 1450.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Nineteenth-century drawing of [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]], originally built in 318 by Constantine]]In 313, [[Constantine I and Christianity|Emperor Constantine I]]'s [[Edict of Milan]] legalised Christianity, and in 330 Constantine moved the imperial capital to [[Constantinople]], modern [[Istanbul, Turkey]]. In 380 the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] made Catholic Christianity the [[state church of the Roman Empire]], a position that within the diminishing territory of the [[Byzantine Empire]] would persist until the empire itself ended in the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, while elsewhere the church was independent of the empire, as became particularly clear with the [[East<U+2013>West Schism]]. During the period of the [[Seven Ecumenical Councils]], five primary sees emerged, an arrangement formalised in the mid-6th century by Emperor [[Justinian I]] as the [[pentarchy]] of Rome, [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]], [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] and [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]].<ref name=Valliere2012>Paul Valliere, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Qrt3Z7fyzlUC&pg=PA92&dq=Justinian+pentarchy&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QYexUuLQDsiS7Qa26oC4BA&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Justinian%20pentarchy&f=false ''Conciliarism''] (Cambridge University Press 2012 ISBN 978-1-10701574-6), p. 92</ref><ref name=Bartholomew2008>Patriarch Bartholomew, [http://books.google.com/books?id=4_UB3_UpIcQC&pg=PA3&dq=Justinian+pentarchy&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iouxUuumMZCBhAf84oCAAg&ved=0CDUQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=Justinian%20pentarchy&f=false ''Encountering the Mystery''] (Random House 2008 ISBN 978-0-38552561-9), p. 3</ref> In 451 the [[Council of Chalcedon]], in a canon of disputed validity,<ref name=Michalopulos>George C.

Most of the Germanic tribes who in the following centuries invaded the Roman Empire had adopted Christianity in its [[Arianism|Arian]] form, which the Catholic Church declared [[Christian heresy|heretical]].<ref>Le Goff, p. 14:"The face of the barbarian invaders had been transformed by another crucial fact.

[[Western Christianity]], particularly through its [[Western monasticism|monasteries]], was a major factor in preserving [[Classical antiquity|classical civilisation]], with its art (see [[Illuminated manuscript]]) and literacy.<ref>''How The Irish Saved Civilization: The Untold Story of Ireland's Heroic Role from the Fall of Rome to the Rise of Medieval Europe'' by Thomas Cahill, 1995.</ref><ref name=Cahill_Thomas>Cahill, Thomas.

During this period, monastic Ireland became a centre of learning and early Irish missionaries such as [[Columbanus|St Columbanus]] and [[St Columba]] spread Christianity and established monasteries across continental Europe.{{ref|name=Cahill_Thomas}}

The massive [[Islam]]ic invasions of the [[Christianity in the 7th century|mid-7th century]] began a long struggle between [[Christianity and Islam]] throughout the Mediterranean Basin. The [[Byzantine Empire]] soon lost the lands of the eastern [[patriarchate]]s of [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]] and [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]] and was reduced to that of [[Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]], the empire's capital. As a result of [[Muslim conquests|Islamic domination of the Mediterranean]], the Frankish state, centred away from that sea, was able to evolve as the dominant power that shaped the Western Europe of the Middle Ages.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=TKUN4UdfVaQC&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=pirenne+without+islam+the+frankish+empire+would+probably+&source=web&ots=2S2LIB7LzP&sig=fr-z8mIrUy_xWKNacev914m7_y0&hl=en ''Medieval Cities'' pp.27<U+2013>32]</ref> The battles of [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Toulouse]] and [[Battle of Poitiers (732)|Poitiers]] halted the Islamic advance in the West. Two or three decades later, in 751, the Byzantine Empire lost to the Lombards the city of Ravenna from which it [[Exarchate of Ravenna|governed]] the small fragments of Italy, including Rome, that acknowledged its sovereignty. The fall of Ravenna meant that confirmation by a no longer existent exarch was not asked for the election in 752 of [[Pope Stephen II]] and that the papacy was forced to look elsewhere for a civil power to protect it.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=Zod9AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA230&dq=%22compelled+to+look+elsewhere+for+a+secular+protector%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZE4_VMTyDubY7AaW-oDQAQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22compelled%20to%20look%20elsewhere%20for%20a%20secular%20protector%22&f=false Jeffrey Richards, ''The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages'' (Routledge 2014 ISBN 978-1-31767817-5), p. 230]</ref> In 754, at the urgent request of Pope Stephen, the Frankish king [[Pepin the Short]] conquered the Lombards.

Though the schism was reconciled, unresolved issues would lead to further division.<ref>{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Willston|title=History of the Christian Church|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1985|pages=250<U+2013>1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFw8PtQhpVoC&pg=PA251&dq=Photian+schism&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vWMYVeKGGsSyggSt24LIAg&ved=0CDEQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&q=Photian%20schism&f=false|isbn=9780684184173}}</ref>

===Medieval and Renaissance periods===
The Catholic Church was the [[Role of the Catholic Church in Western civilization|dominant influence on Western civilisation]] from late antiquity to the dawn of the modern age.<ref name="O'CollinsPref">[[Gerald O'Collins|O'Collins]], p. v (preface).</ref> It was the primary sponsor of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Mannerist and Baroque styles in art, architecture and music.<ref>Woods, pp. 115<U+2013>27</ref> Renaissance figures such as [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Botticelli]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Titian]], [[Bernini]] and [[Caravaggio]] are examples of the numerous visual artists sponsored by the Church.<ref>Duffy, p. 133.</ref>

In the eleventh century, the efforts of [[Hildebrand of Sovana]] led to the creation of the [[College of Cardinals]] to elect new Popes, starting with [[Pope Alexander II]] in the [[Papal election, 1061|papal election of 1061]]. When Alexander II died, Hildebrand was elected to succeed him, as [[Pope Gregory VII]]. The basic election system of the College of Cardinals which Gregory VII helped establish has continued to function into the twenty-first century. Pope Gregory VII further initiated the [[Gregorian Reforms]] regarding the independence of the clergy from secular authority. This led to the [[Investiture Controversy]] between the church and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s, over which had the authority to appoint bishops and Popes.<ref name="Vidmar107">Vidmar, ''The Catholic Church Through the Ages'' (2005), pp. 107&ndash;11</ref><ref name="Duffy78">Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'' (1997), p. 78, quote: "By contrast, Paschal's successor [[Pope Eugene II|Eugenius II]] (824&ndash;7), elected with imperial influence, gave away most of these papal gains. He acknowledged the Emperor's sovereignty in the papal state, and he accepted a constitution imposed by Lothair which established imperial supervision of the administration of Rome, imposed an oath to the Emperor on all citizens, and required the Pope&ndash;elect to swear fealty before he could be consecrated. Under [[Pope Sergius II|Sergius II]] (844&ndash;7) it was even agreed that the Pope could not be consecrated without an imperial mandate, and that the ceremony must be in the presence of his representative, a revival of some of the more galling restrictions of Byzantine rule."</ref>

In 1095, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexius I]] appealed to [[Pope Urban II]] for help against renewed Muslim invasions in the [[Byzantine<U+2013>Seljuk Wars]],<ref name="rileysmith">Riley-Smith, p. 8</ref> which caused Urban to launch the [[First Crusade]] aimed at aiding the Byzantine Empire and returning the [[Holy Land]] to Christian control.<ref name="Bokenkotter140">Bokenkotter, pp. 140<U+2013>141</ref> In the [[Christianity in the 11th century|11th century]], strained relations between the primarily Greek church and the [[Latin Church]] separated them in the [[East<U+2013>West Schism]], partially due to conflicts over [[papal authority]].

In the early 13th century [[mendicant orders]] were founded by [[Francis of Assisi]] and [[Saint Dominic|Dominic de Guzm<U+00E1>n]]. The ''studia conventualia'' and ''[[studium generale|studia generalia]]'' of the mendicant orders played a large role in the transformation of Church sponsored [[cathedral school]]s and palace schools, such as that of [[Charlemagne]] at [[Aachen]], into the prominent universities of Europe.<ref>Woods, pp. 44<U+2013>48</ref> [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] theologians and philosophers such as the Dominican priest [[Thomas Aquinas]] studied and taught at these studia. Aquinas' ''Summa Theologica'' was an intellectual milestone in its synthesis of the legacy of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek philosophers]] such as Plato and Aristotle with the content of Christian revelation.<ref>Bokenkotter, pp. 158<U+2013>159</ref>

A growing sense of church-state conflicts marked the 14th century. To escape instability in Rome, [[Pope Clement V|Clement V]] in 1309 became the first of seven popes to reside in the fortified city of [[Avignon]] in southern France<ref name="Duffy122">Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'' (1997), p.&nbsp;122</ref> during a period known as the [[Avignon Papacy]]. The Avignon Papacy ended in 1376 when the Pope returned to Rome,<ref name="McManners232">Morris, p. 232</ref> but was followed in 1378 by the 38-year-long [[Western Schism|Western schism]] with claimants to the papacy in Rome, Avignon and (after 1409) Pisa.<ref name="McManners232"/> The matter was finally resolved in 1417 at the [[Council of Constance]] where the cardinals called upon all three claimants to the papal throne to resign, and held a new election naming [[Pope Martin V|Martin V]] pope.<ref name="McManners240">Collinson, p. 240</ref>

In 1438, the [[Council of Florence]] convened, which featured a strong dialogue focussed on understanding the theological differences between the East and West, with the hope of reuniting the Catholic and Orthodox churches.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Constantinople and the West|last=Geanakoplos|first=Deno John|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, WI|ISBN=0299118800 }}</ref>  Several eastern churches reunited, forming the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Colinge|first=William J.|title=Historical Dictionary of Catholicism|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2012|page=169|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LR0Nyt3bi_MC&pg=PA169&dq=Council+of+Florence+Eastern+Catholic+Churches&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cdEZVf_uIua1sQTZqoHYBg&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Council%20of%20Florence%20Eastern%20Catholic%20Churches&f=false|isbn=978-0810857551}}</ref>

===Age of discovery===
{{main|Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery}}

The [[Age of Discovery]] beginning in the 15th century saw the expansion of Western Europe's political and cultural influence worldwide. Because of the prominent role the strongly Catholic nations of Spain and Portugal played in Western Colonialism, Catholicism was spread to the Americas, Asia and Oceania by explorers, conquistadors, and missionaries, as well as by the transformation of societies through the socio-political mechanisms of colonial rule. [[Pope Alexander VI]] had awarded colonial rights over most of the newly discovered lands to Spain and Portugal<ref name="Koschorke13">Koschorke, p. 13, p. 283</ref> and the ensuing ''patronato'' system allowed state authorities, not the Vatican, to control all clerical appointments in the new colonies.<ref>Hastings (1994), p. 72</ref> In 1521 the Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]] made the first Catholic converts in the Philippines.<ref name="Koschorke21">Koschorke, p. 21</ref> Elsewhere, Portuguese missionaries under the Spanish Jesuit [[Francis Xavier]] evangelised in India, China, and Japan.<ref name="Koschorke3">Koschorke, p. 3, p. 17</ref>

===Reformation===
{{Main|Protestant Reformation}}
[[File:Lucas Cranach (I) workshop - Martin Luther (Uffizi).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Martin Luther]] initiated the [[Protestant Reformation]] against the Catholic Church in 1517]]
In 1517, [[Martin Luther]], an [[Order of Saint Augustine|Augustinian]] friar in Germany, sent his ''[[Ninety-Five Theses]]'' to several bishops.<ref name="Bokenkotter215">Bokenkotter, p. 215</ref> His theses protested key points of Catholic [[doctrine]] as well as the sale of [[indulgence]]s.<ref name="Bokenkotter215"/><ref name="Vidmar184">Vidmar, p. 184.</ref> In [[Switzerland]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]], [[John Calvin]], and other [[Protestant Reformers]] further criticised Catholic teachings. These challenges developed into the European movement called the [[Protestant Reformation]], which gave birth to a variety of [[list of Christian denominations|Christian denominations]] known today collectively as [[Protestantism]].<ref name="Bokenkotter223">Bokenkotter, pp. 223<U+2013>224</ref> The [[English Reformation]] during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] began as a political dispute. When the pope denied Henry's petition for a [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|declaration of nullity]] of his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]], he had the [[Acts of Supremacy]] passed, making him head of [[Church of England|the English Church]].<ref name="Bokenkotter235">Bokenkotter, pp. 235<U+2013>237</ref>

The Reformation led to clashes between the Protestant [[Schmalkaldic League]] and the Catholic Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and his allies. The first nine-year war ended in 1555 with the [[Peace of Augsburg]] but continued tensions produced a far graver conflict<U+2014>the [[Thirty Years' War]]<U+2014>which broke out in 1618.<ref name="Vidmar233"/> In France, a series of conflicts termed the [[French Wars of Religion]] was fought from 1562 to 1598 between the [[Huguenot]]s (French [[Calvinists]]) and the forces of the [[Catholic League (French)|French Catholic League]]. A series of popes sided with and became financial supporters of the Catholic League.<ref name="Duffy177">Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'' (1997), pp. 177<U+2013>8</ref> This ended under [[Pope Clement VIII]], who hesitantly accepted King [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV's]] 1598 [[Edict of Nantes]], which granted civil and [[religious toleration]] to French Protestants.<ref name="Vidmar233">Vidmar, ''The Catholic Church Through the Ages'' (2005), p. 233</ref><ref name="Duffy177"/>

The [[Council of Trent]] (1545<U+2013>1563) became the driving force behind the [[Counter-Reformation]] in response to the Protestant movement. Doctrinally, it reaffirmed central Catholic teachings such as [[transubstantiation]] and the requirement for love and hope as well as faith to attain salvation.<ref name="Bokenkotter242">Bokenkotter, pp. 242<U+2013>244</ref> In subsequent centuries, Catholicism spread widely across the world despite experiencing a reduction in its hold on European populations due to the growth of [[religious scepticism]] during and after the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].<ref>Maxwell, Melvin Bible Truth or Church Tradition page 70</ref>

The [[French Revolution]] of 1789 brought about a shifting of powers from the Church to the State, destruction of churches and the establishment of a [[Cult of Reason]].<ref name="Bokenkotter285">Bokenkotter, pp. 283<U+2013>285</ref> In 1798, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s General Louis Alexandre Berthier invaded Italy, imprisoning [[Pope Pius VI]], who died in captivity.

====Second Vatican Council====
{{Main|Post Vatican II history of the Catholic Church|Spirit of Vatican II}}
{{See also|Catholic Church#contraception}}
The [[Second Vatican Council]] in the 1960s introduced the most significant changes to Catholic practices since the [[Council of Trent]] four centuries before.<ref>The Second Vatican Council Celebrating Its Achievements and the Future page 86</ref> Initiated by [[Pope John XXIII]], this ecumenical council modernised the practices of the Catholic Church, allowing the Mass to be said in the [[vernacular]] (local language) and encouraging "fully conscious, and active participation in liturgical celebrations".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html |title=CONSTITUTION ON THE SACRED LITURGY SACROSANCTUM CONCILIUM |publisher=Vatican.va |date=4 December 1963 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref> It intended to engage the Church more closely with the present world (''[[aggiornamento]]''), which was described by its advocates as an "opening of the windows".<ref name="Duffy272">Duffy, pp. 270<U+2013>276</ref> In addition to changes in the liturgy, it led to changes to the Church's approach to [[Catholic Church and ecumenism|ecumenism]],<ref>Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'' (1997), p. 272, p. 274</ref> and a call to improved relations with non-Christian religions, especially [[Judaism]], in its document ''[[Nostra aetate]]''.<ref name="NOSTRA AETATE">Pope Paul VI. [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651028_nostra-aetate_en.html ''Nostra aetate'': Declaration on the Relation of the Church to Non-Christian Religions]. 28 October 1965. Retrieved 16 June 2011. According to Section 4: "True, the Jewish authorities and those who followed their lead pressed for the death of Christ; still, what happened in His passion cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today. Although the Church is the new people of God, the Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God, as if this followed from the Holy Scriptures."</ref>

The council, however, generated significant controversy in implementing its reforms: proponents of the "[[Spirit of Vatican II]]" such as Swiss theologian [[Hans K<U+00FC>ng]] said that Vatican II had "not gone far enough" to change church policies.<ref>Bauckham, p. 373</ref> [[Traditionalist Catholics]], such as [[Archbishop]] [[Marcel Lefebvre]], however, strongly criticised the council, arguing that its liturgical reforms led "to the destruction of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the sacraments", among other issues.<ref>O'Neel, Brian.

San Diego: Catholic Answers, April 2003.</ref>  Several teachings of the Catholic Church came under increased scrutiny both concurrent with and following the council; among those teachings was the church's teaching regarding the immorality of contraception. The recent introduction of [[hormonal contraception]] (including "the pill"), which were believed by some to be morally different than previous methods, prompted John XXIII to form a committee to advise him of the moral and theological issues with the new method.<ref>{{cite book|last=May|first=John F.|title=World Population Policies: Their Origin, Evolution, and Impact|publisher=Springer|year=2012|pages=202-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UCQRxtm3Z34C&pg=PA203&dq=contraceptives+pill+John+XXIII+1963&hl=en&sa=X&ei=AakeVcuQJ8uqNuy4gLgK&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=contraceptives%20pill%20John%20XXIII%201963&f=false|isbn=978-94-007-2837-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Kinkel|first=R.

Paul did not agree with the arguments presented, and eventually issued ''[[Humanae vitae]]'', saying it upheld the constant teaching of the church against contraception, expressly including hormonal methods as prohibited.<ref group=note>While ruling contraception to be prohibited, Pope Paul VI did, however, consider [[Natural Family Planning]] methods to be morally permissible if used with just cause.</ref>  A large negative response to this document followed its release.<ref name=HV_then_now>{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/germain-grisez-on-humanae-vitae-then-and-now|title=Germain Grisez on "Humanae Vitae," Then and Now: The Dust Still Hasn't Settled, But There Are Signs of Hope|publisher=Zenit: The World Seen from Rome|date=14 July 2003|accessdate=16 November 2014}}</ref>

[[File:President and Mrs. Reagan meet Pope John Paul II 1982.jpg|thumb|[[Pope John Paul II]] with U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife, [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]], in 1982.]]
In 1978, [[Pope John Paul II]], formerly archbishop of [[Krak<U+00F3>w]] in then-[[Communism|Communist]] Poland, became the first non-Italian Pope in 455 years. His 27-year [[pontificate]] was one of the longest in history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.co.uk/this-day-in-history/April-02.html;jsessionid=08931E713115A304B13BB1A6FA315A63.public1 |title=2&nbsp;April <U+2013> This Day in History |publisher=History.co.uk |accessdate=28 October 2010}}</ref> [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], the president of the [[Soviet Union]], credited the Polish Pope with hastening the fall of Communism in Europe.<ref>{{cite news|author=Peter and Margaret Hebblethwaite and Peter Stanford |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/apr/02/guardianobituaries.catholicism |title=Obituary: Pope John Paul II |work=The Guardian |date=2 April 2005|accessdate=28 October 2010 |location=London}}</ref>

John Paul sought to evangelise an increasingly secular world.

ISBN 978-0-500-28608-1.</ref> and used television and radio as means of spreading the Church's teachings.  He also emphasised the dignity of work and natural rights of labors to have fair wages and safe conditions in ''[[Laborem exercens]]'',<ref>{{cite web|author=John Paul II|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25031995_evangelium-vitae_en.html|title=Laborem exercens|publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|date=15 May 1981|accessdate=16 November 2014}}</ref> and also emphasised several church teachings, including moral exhortations against [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]], and against widespread use of the [[death penalty]], in ''[[Evangelium Vitae]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Paul II|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25031995_evangelium-vitae_en.html|title=Evangelium Vitae|publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|date=25 March 1995|accessdate=16 November 2014}}</ref>

===Twenty-first century===
In 2005, following the death of John Paul II, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] was elected.  Originally from Germany, he served as head of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] under John Paul.  He was known for upholding traditional Christian values as a means to ward off secularisation,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,635185276,00.html |title=Benedict's encyclical offers hope for world |work=[[Deseret News]]| first=Jerry Earl | last=Johnston|date=18 February 2006 |accessdate=12 September 2010}} [http://www.webcitation.org/62DpkqLxB WebCitation archive]</ref> and for liberalising use of the [[Tridentine Mass]] as found in the [[Roman Missal]] of 1962.<ref>Gledhill, Ruth [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article667813.ece "Pope set to bring back Latin Mass that divided the Church"] ''The Times'' 11 October 2006.

[[Pope Francis]] succeeded Benedict in 2013.  He was warmly received by many, although he drew concerns from some conservatives. In 2014, the first of two assemblies of the Synod of Bishops addressed the church's ministry towards families and marriages.  Particular media attention focussed on the proposed wording of an interim document addressing Catholics in "irregular" relationships, such as Catholics who divorced and remarried outside of the church without a declaration of nullity.  The first of the two, the [[Third Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops]], ran from 5 to 19 October 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://world.time.com/2013/10/08/pope-francis-calls-extraordinary-synod-on-family-and-marriage/|last=Dias|first=Elizabeth|title=Pope Francis Calls Extraordinary Synod on Family and Marriage|work=Time Magazine|date=8 October 2013|accessdate=17 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2014/10/24/the-media-synod-has-eclipsed-the-real-one/|first=Fr.
