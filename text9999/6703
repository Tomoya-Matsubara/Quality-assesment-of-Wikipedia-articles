==History==
Velma Barfield was born in rural [[South Carolina]],{{cn|date=November 2012}} but grew up near [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]]. Her father reportedly was abusive and she resented her mother who did not stop the beatings.<ref name="news">{{cite web |title=Death Sentence, a new book by Jerry Bledsoe |work=Correction News |month=November |year=1998 |url=http://www.doc.state.nc.us/NEWS/1998/9811news/bledsoe.htm |publisher=North Carolina Department of Correction |accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref> She escaped by marrying Thomas Burke in 1949.<ref name="obit">{{cite news |title= Burial Service Is Held For Executed Woman |work=New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E3D61339F937A35752C1A962948260 |date=1984-11-04 |accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref> The couple had two children and were reportedly happy until Barfield had a [[hysterectomy]] and developed back pain.<ref name="news"/> These events led to a behavioral change in Barfield and an eventual drug addiction.<ref name="news"/>

Thomas Burke began to drink and Barfield's complaints turned into bitter arguments.<ref name="news"/> On April 4, 1969, after Burke had passed out, Barfield and the children left the house, returning to find the home burned and Burke dead.<ref name="news"/><ref>Vronsky, Peter. ''Female Serial Killers: How and Why Women Become Monsters'', p.197-98. Berkley Books, 2007, ISBN 0-425-21390-0</ref> Only a few months later, her home burned once again, this time with a reward of [[insurance]] money.

In 1970, Barfield married a widower, Jennings Barfield. Less than a year after their marriage, Jennings died on March 22 1971 from [[heart]] complications, leaving Velma a [[widow]] once again.

In 1974, Barfield's mother, Lillian Bullard, showed symptoms of intense [[diarrhea]], [[vomiting]] and [[nausea]], only to fully recover a few days later. During the Christmas season of the same year, Lillian experienced the same illness as earlier that year, resulting in her death only hours after arriving at the hospital on December 30, 1974.<ref name="clark"/>

In 1976, Barfield began caring for the elderly, working for Montgomery and Dollie Edwards. Montgomery fell ill and died on January 29, 1977. A little over a month after the death of her husband, Dollie experienced identical symptoms to that of Velma's mother and she too died (March 1, 1977), a death to which Barfield later confessed.<ref name="clark"/>

The following year, 1977, Barfield took another caretaking job, this time for 76-year old Record Lee, who had broken her leg. On June 4, 1977, Lee's husband, John Henry, began experiencing racking pains in his stomach and chest along with vomiting and diarrhea. He died soon afterward and Barfield later confessed to his murder.<ref name="clark"/>

Another victim was Rowland Stuart Taylor, Barfield's boyfriend and a relative of Dollie Edwards.<ref name="clark"/> Fearing he had discovered she had been forging checks on his account, she mixed an [[arsenic]]-based rat poison into his beer and tea.<ref name="clark"/> He died on February 3, 1978, while she was trying to "nurse" him back to health; an autopsy found arsenic in Taylor's system.<ref name="clark"/> After her arrest, the body of Jennings Barfield was exhumed and found to have traces of arsenic, a murder that Barfield denied having committed.<ref name="clark">{{cite web |title=Velma Margie Barfield #29 |publisher=Office of the Clark County Prosecuting Attorney |url=http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/barfield029.htm |accessdate=2008-01-16}}</ref>  Although she subsequently confessed to the murders of Lillian Bullard, Dollie Edwards, and John Henry Lee,she was tried and convicted only for the murder of Taylor.<ref name="clark"/>  Singer-songwriter [[Jonathan Byrd (musician)|Jonathan Byrd]] is the grandson of Jennings Barfield and his first wife.

==Prison and execution==
During her stay on death row, Barfield became a devout born again Christian.<ref name="born">{{cite web |url=http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/barfield029.htm |title=Death Penalty News |work=Death Penalty Information |publisher=Office of the Clark County Prosecuting Attorney |date=1997-12-15 |accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref>  While she had been a devout churchgoer all of her life and had often attended revivals held by [[Rex Humbard]] and other evangelists, she later said she'd only been playing at being a Christian.

Her last few years were spent ministering to prisoners, for which she received praise from [[Billy Graham]].<ref name="graham">{{cite news |title=Graham Praises Woman Executed for Murder |work=New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E5D81538F93BA35751C1A962948260 |date=1984-12-08 |accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref> Barfield's involvement in Christian ministry was extensive to the point that an effort was made to obtain a commutation to life imprisonment.<ref name="news"/> After a Federal court appeal was denied, Barfield instructed her attorneys to abandon plans to appeal to the Supreme Court.<ref name="first"/> Barfield was executed on November 2, 1984<ref>1984 Year in Review: Velma Barfield Put to Death-http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1984/Velma-Barfield-Put-to-Death/12311825972512-13/</ref> at Central Prison in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], [[North Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://webapps6.doc.state.nc.us/apps/offender/offend1?DOCNUM=0019092&SENTENCEINFO=yes |work=North Carolina Department of Correction Public Access Information System |title=Barfield, Velma B. |accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref> She released a statement before the execution, stating "I know that everybody has gone through a lot of pain, all the families connected, and I am sorry, and I want to thank everybody who have been supporting me all these six years."<ref name="first"/> Barfield declined a [[last meal]], having instead a bag of [[Cheez Doodles]] and a 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola.<ref>{{cite news|title=First Woman Is Executed in U.S. Since 1962|work=The New York Times|author=William E.

Barfield's execution raised some political controversies when [[Governor of North Carolina|Governor]] [[Jim Hunt]], who faced a bout with incumbent [[Jesse Helms]] for his [[US Senate|Senate]] seat (which Hunt lost), rejected Barfield's request for clemency.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956964-2,00.html http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956964-2,00.html (TIME)]</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955309,00.html | work=Time | title=Justice: Handling a Deadly Issue | date=1984-10-08 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}</ref>

Barfield was buried in a small rural North Carolina cemetery, near her first husband, Thomas Burke.<ref name="obit"/>
