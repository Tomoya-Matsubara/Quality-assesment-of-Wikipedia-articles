The '''King Philip shipwreck''' is the [[Shipwreck|wreck]] of the ''King Philip'', a 19th century [[clipper]] ship<U+2014>a fast commercial three-masted sailing ship<U+2014>which was named after an Indian chief. The wreck of this ship is only rarely visible; very infrequently the timbers can be seen protruding from the sands of [[Ocean Beach, San Francisco, California|Ocean Beach]], on the Pacific Ocean coast of [[San Francisco]], California.

== Clipper<U+2019>s history==
[[File:King Philip the ship.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement poster for ''King Philip'']]
''King Philip'' was built in [[Alna, Maine]] in 1856. Seven years later she was being advertised as "a strictly first-class clipper ship with quick dispatch" and "well-known to shippers as one of the best and most reliable vessels in the California trade. Stands A-1 for seven years". With a wooden [[Hull  (watercraft)|hull]]  and three [[Mast (sailing) |masts]], she was a medium-sized clipper displacing 1,100 tons.<ref>[http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cdnc/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&cl=search&d=DAC18570119.2.15&srpos=24&e=-------en-Logical-20-DAC-21-byDA---%22king+philip%22-all--- Launched] ''Daily Alta California'', Volume 9, Number 18, 19 January 1857.</ref> She was named for [[Metacomet]] (who was known to the English as "King Philip"), a war chief or ''[[sachem]]'' of the [[Wampanoag]] Indians. Metacomet was the Wampanoag's leader in [[King Philip's War]].<ref name=sfgate/><ref name=nps/>

The ship carried cargo (including [[guano]]) from the Eastern United States to San Francisco.  The route required going around [[Cape Horn]], which is famous for its enormous storms.<ref name=sfgate/> The historian [[Samuel Eliot Morison]] has called this kind of ship "the noblest of all sailing vessels." The fastest-ever clipper ship, [[Flying Cloud (clipper)|''Flying Cloud'']], once sailed from New York City to San Francisco in only 89 days; the ''King Philip'', although fast, was not as fast.<ref name=sfgate/>

''King Philip'' had a turbulent history, including at least two [[mutiny|mutinies]] or sailors' rebellions, with the ship surviving being set on fire on both of those occasions.<ref name=sfgate/> Finally, on January 25, 1878, 22 years after she was built, the ''King Philip'' left San Francisco Bay, carrying no cargo. A steam-powered [[tugboat]] had towed her out of the Bay, in order to help her maneuver in the dangerous waters. At that exact moment, an accident caused the death of the captain of a ship that was nearby, and the tugboat crew was called upon to help out with that emergency. Left on her own without the tugboat to steer her, the ''King Philip'' dropped an anchor, but the anchor did not hold fast, and the clipper drifted with the current towards the breakers of the beach and ran aground in heavy surf, which caused the ship to break apart. <ref name=sfgate/>

In its news article, the ''Daily Alta California'' described the scene:
{{cquote|Left helpless, anchors gone, sails clewed up, no friendly breeze, no hope, the gallant craft strikes and strikes the sand as if in anger, but powerless, as the hard, cold beach starts her timbers, tears her rudder out, crushes her keel and mashes her stout timbers in matchwood<U+2026><ref name=Philip/>}}
All the members of the crew survived the shipwreck, it being so close to the sandy beach and dry land, but the clipper herself was a total loss.<ref name=sfgate/> Right after the incident, what was left of the wrecked clipper was offered up for auction. <ref name=auction/> The remnants were bought for $1,050 by a San Francisco businessman named John Molloy, who was able to salvage metal fittings and sails from the destroyed clipper.<ref name=sfgate/> The rest of the wreck was blown up and abandoned.<ref name=sfgate/>

==Reappearing wreck ==
[[File:Shipwreck at Ocean Beach.jpg| The wreck of the ''King Philip'' as it was seen in May of 2007|thumb]]
Left in place at extreme low tide level in 1878, what is left of the wreck of the ''King Philip'' is usually completely covered in sand. Sometimes, as the profile of the sand on the beach shifts and changes, the timbers reemerge and are visible during low tides. This is considered to happen about every 20 years. After appearing in 1985, the next time the wreck was visible was almost 22 years later, in May of 2007.<ref name=sfgate/> Stephen Haller, who is a historian for the [[National Park Service]], says that the ''King Philip'' is the best-preserved wreck of a wooden ship in the San Francisco Bay area, which has a total of approximately 200 old shipwrecks.<ref name=sfgate/>

In November 2010, only 3 years after its previous appearance, the wreck was visible once again protruding from the sand.<ref name=now/> Because Ocean Beach belongs to the National Park Service and is federal property, the wreck of the old ship is federal property.<ref name=sfgate/>
