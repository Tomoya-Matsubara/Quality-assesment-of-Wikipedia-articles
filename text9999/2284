'''James George Janos'''<ref name=OWOW>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/j/jesse-ventura.html|title=OWOW profile}}</ref> (born July 15, 1951), best known as '''Jesse "The Body" Ventura''', is an American [[politician]], retired [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and [[color commentator]], [[Underwater Demolition Team|Navy UDT]] [[veteran]], [[actor]], and former [[radio]] and [[television]] [[talk show]] host. As a professional wrestler, he is best known for his tenure in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] as a wrestler and color commentator. In 2004, he was inducted into the company's [[WWE Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]].<ref name=OWOW/>

In the [[Minnesota gubernatorial election, 1998|Minnesota gubernatorial election of 1998]], running as an [[Independence Party of Minnesota|Independent]] and member of the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]], he was elected the [[List of Governors of Minnesota|38th]] [[Governor of Minnesota]] and served from January 4, 1999 to January 6, 2003 without seeking a second term. 
==Early life==
Ventura was born James George Janos in [[Minneapolis]], the son of Bernice Martha ([[married and maiden names|n<U+00E9>e]] Lenz) and George William Janos. His father's parents were from what is today [[Slovakia]], and his mother was of German descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/political/ventura.html |title=Ancestry of Jesse Ventura |publisher=Wargs.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref> Ventura has described himself as [[Slovak American|Slovak]].<ref>April 1, 2008, in Larry King interview with Ventura on NBC<!--Bot-generated title--></ref> Ventura (then still using his legal name of Janos) attended the now-closed Cooper Elementary School, and graduated from Minneapolis' [[Roosevelt High School (Minneapolis)|Roosevelt High School]] in 1969.

From September 11, 1969 to September 10, 1975, during the [[Vietnam War]] era, he served in the [[United States Navy]].<ref name=OWOW/> While on active duty, Ventura was part of [[Underwater Demolition Team|Underwater Demolition Team 12]] (UDT).<ref name=slambio/> The UDT was merged with the [[United States Navy SEALs|US Navy SEALs]] in 1983, 8 years after Ventura was no longer in the Navy. He was awarded the [[National Defense Service Medal]] and the [[Vietnam Service Medal]] but was not in combat thus did not qualify for the [[Combat Action Ribbon]].

In 1973, Ventura was a full-patch member of the [[San Diego]] chapter of the [[Mongols (motorcycle club)|Mongols]], an [[Outlaw motorcycle club#One Percenters|outlaw]] motorcycle gang and [[organized crime syndicate]] for nine months, and rose to the rank of Sergeant-at-Arms. His [[nickname]] by Mongol members was "[[Superman]]". Ventura has said on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' in 2009 that "once you're a Mongol, you're always a Mongol."<ref>[http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=6DC12C2B-3048-52EA-1E11892F489953D7 One on One with Jesse Ventura]</ref><ref>[http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2002/May-12-Sun-2002/news/18724079.html OUTLAW GANGS: Northern Nevada eyes biker enmity]</ref>

He returned to [[Minnesota]], and attended [[North Hennepin Community College]] in the mid-1970s, at the same time he began [[Powerlifting|weightlifting]] and [[professional wrestling|wrestling]]. He was a bodyguard for [[The Rolling Stones]] for a short time before he ventured into professional wrestling and changed his name.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/on2/elections/ventura.html Jesse Ventura] PBS</ref>

===Early career===
He created the stage name Jesse "The Body" Ventura to go with the persona of a bully-ish beach bodybuilder, picking the name "[[Ventura, California|Ventura]]" from a map as part of his "bleach [[blond]] from [[California]]" [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|character]].<ref name=OWOW/> As a wrestler, Ventura performed as a [[heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] and often used the motto "Win if you can, lose if you must, but always cheat!" Much of his flamboyant persona was copied from [[Billy Graham (wrestler)|"Superstar" Billy Graham]], a charismatic and popular performer during the 1970s and '80s.<ref name=OWOW/><ref name=mol>John Molinaro, ''The Top 100 Pro Wrestlers of All Time'', (Winding Stair Press: 2002), page 199</ref> Years later, as a broadcaster, Ventura made a running joke out of claiming that Graham stole all of his ring attire ideas from him.

===Singles and tag team success===
In 1975, Ventura made his debut in the Central States territory, before moving to the Pacific Northwest, where he wrestled for promoter [[Don Owen (wrestling promoter)|Don Owen]] as Jesse "The Great" Ventura.<ref name=OWOW/><ref name=mol/> Sometime later, he adopted the more permanent nickname, "The Body". During his stay in [[Portland, Oregon]], he had notable feuds with [[Dutch Savage]] and [[Jimmy Snuka]] and won the Pacific Northwest Wrestling title twice (once from each wrestler), and the tag team title five times (twice each with [[Apache Bull Ramos|Bull Ramos]] and [[Buddy Rose|"Playboy" Buddy Rose]], and once with Jerry Oates). He later moved to his hometown promotion, the [[American Wrestling Association]] in Minnesota, and began teaming with [[Adrian Adonis]] as the "East-West Connection" in 1979.<ref name=WWEProfile/><ref name=mol/> The duo won the promotion's [[AWA World Tag Team Championship|World Tag Team Championship]] on July 20, 1980 on a forfeit when [[Verne Gagne]], one-half of the tag team champions along with [[Maurice Vachon|Mad Dog Vachon]], failed to show up for a title defense in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]].<ref name=OWOW/> The duo held the belts for nearly a year, losing to "The High Flyers" ([[Greg Gagne (wrestler)|Greg Gagne]] and [[Jim Brunzell]]).<ref name=OWOW/>

===Retirement and commentary===
Shortly after losing the belts, the duo moved on to the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]], where they were managed by [[Freddie Blassie|"Classy" Freddie Blassie]].<ref name=OWOW/> Although the duo was unable to capture the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]], both Adonis and Ventura became singles title contenders, each earning several title shots at [[WWE Championship|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Bob Backlund]].<ref name=OWOW/>

Ventura continued to wrestle until September 1984, when blood clots in his lungs ended his in-ring career; it forced him to miss a title match against WWF Champion [[Hulk Hogan]].<ref name=OWOW/> Ventura claimed the blood clots were a result of his exposure to [[Agent Orange]] during his time in Vietnam.<ref name=OWOW/><ref name=slambio>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/ventura_jesse.html|title=Jesse Ventura's bio|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2009-06-26|date=January 21, 2006|author=Milner, John M.}}</ref>  Ventura did return to the ring to participate in a six-man tag team match in December 1985 as he, [[Roddy Piper]], and "Cowboy" [[Bob Orton]] defeated [[Hillbilly Jim]], [[Stan Frazier|Uncle Elmer]], and [[Gene Petit|Cousin Luke]] in a match which was broadcast on ''Saturday Night's Main Event''.<ref name=OWOW/>  After a failed comeback bid, he began to do [[color commentator#wrestling|color commentary]] on television for ''[[List of former World Wrestling Entertainment programming#All-Star Wrestling (1970<U+2013>1986)|All-Star Wrestling]]'' (replacing [[Angelo Mosca]]) and later ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars of Wrestling]]'' (initially alongside [[Vince McMahon]] and [[Bruno Sammartino]], and with McMahon after Sammartino's departure from the WWF in 1988), hosted his own talk segment on the WWF's ''Superstars of Wrestling'' called "The Body Shop", and did color commentary on radio for a few [[National Football League]] teams (among them, the [[Minnesota Vikings]] and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]).<ref name=OWOW/> Ventura most notably co-hosted ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' with Vince McMahon and the first six [[WrestleMania]]s (1985<U+2013>1990) and most of the WWF's pay-per-views at the time with [[Gorilla Monsoon]] (the lone exception for Ventura being the [[SummerSlam (1988)|first SummerSlam]], in which Ventura served as the guest referee during the main event).  Following a dispute with WWF Chairman Vince McMahon over him using his image for the video game company [[Sega]], McMahon<U+2014>who had a contract with rival company [[Nintendo]] at the time<U+2014>released Ventura from the company in August 1990.<ref name="VBodt">Jake Tapper, "Body Slam: The Jesse Ventura Story," pg. 104-105</ref>

In February 1992 at [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] [[SuperBrawl#SuperBrawl II|SuperBrawl II]], Ventura joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] as a commentator. His professional wrestling commentary style was an extension of his wrestling persona, as he was partial to the villains, which was something new and different at the time,<ref name=OWOW/> but would still occasionally give credit where it was due, praising the athleticism of [[Dynamite Kid]] and [[Randy Savage]] (who was championed by Ventura for years, even when he was a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]]). The lone exception to this rule was the [[WrestleMania VI]] match between Hulk Hogan and the [[Warrior (wrestler)|Ultimate Warrior]]. Since they were both crowd favorites, Ventura took a neutral position in his commentary; even praising Hogan's display of sportsmanship at the end of the match when he handed over the WWF Championship to the Warrior after he lost the title. The praise of Hogan's action was unusual for Ventura because he regularly rooted against Hogan during his matches. Hogan and Ventura were, at one point, close friends.<ref name="VBot1">Jesse Ventura, "I Ain't Got Time To Bleed pg. 108</ref> Ventura, however, abruptly ended the friendship after he discovered, during his lawsuit against Vince McMahon, that Hogan was the one who had told Vince about Ventura's attempt to form a labor union in 1984.<ref name="VBot1" /> Ventura was released by WCW President [[Eric Bishoff]] for falling asleep during a ''WCW Worldwide'' TV taping at Disney MGM Studios in July 1994, though its been speculated the move may have had more to do with Hulk Hogan's arrival shortly before.<ref name=OWOW/>

===Litigation===
In 1987, while negotiating his contract as a [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]] commentator, Ventura waived his rights to royalties on videotape sales when he was falsely told that only feature performers received such royalties. In 1991, having discovered that other non-feature performers received [[royalties]], Ventura brought an action for [[fraud]], misappropriation of [[publicity]] rights, and [[quantum meruit]] in [[Minnesota]] [[state court]] against Titan Sports. Titan removed the case to [[United States district court|federal court]], and Ventura won an $801,333 [[jury]] [[verdict]] on the last claim. The judgment was affirmed on [[appeal]], and the case,''<ref>[http://www.jollylager.com/pub/caselaw/ventura.html Ventura v. Titan Sports, Inc.]</ref> '' 65 F.3d 725 (8th Cir.1995), is an important result in the law of [[restitution]].

As a result of Ventura's [[lawsuit]], whenever WWE uses his commentary for mass marketed [[VHS]]/[[DVD]], Ventura gets a percentage of the sales.

===Return to the World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment===
In mid-1999, Ventura reappeared on WWF television during his term as Governor of Minnesota, acting as the special guest referee for main event of [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]] held in Minneapolis.<ref name=OWOW/> Ventura would continue his relationship with the WWF by performing commentary for Vince McMahon's short-lived [[XFL]].<ref name=OWOW/> On the March 20, 2003 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', Ventura appeared in a [[List of professional wrestling terms#V|taped interview]] to talk about the match between McMahon and [[Hulk Hogan]] at [[WrestleMania XIX]].<ref name=OWOW/> Less than a year later, he would be inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] on March 13, 2004 and the following night at [[WrestleMania XX]], he approached the ring to interview [[Donald Trump]], who had a front row seat at the event.<ref name=OWOW/> Trump affirmed that Ventura would receive his moral and financial support were he to ever reenter the world of politics. Alluding to the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 election]], Ventura boldly announced that "In 2008, maybe we oughta put a wrestler in the [[White House]]". On the June 11, 2007 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', Ventura appeared to give comments about Vince McMahon.<ref name=OWOW/>

Ventura was guest host on the November 23, 2009 episode of ''Raw'' during which he retained his [[heel (professional wrestling)|villainous]] persona by siding with the number one contender, [[Sheamus O'Shaunessy|Sheamus]] over WWE Champion [[John Cena]]. This happened while he confronted Cena about how it was unfair that Cena always got a title shot in the WWE while Ventura didn't during his WWE career. After that Sheamus attacked Cena and put him through a table. Ventura then made the match a Title match at [[WWE TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs|TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs]]. During the show, for the first time in nearly 20 years, Vince McMahon joined Ventura at ringside to provide match commentary together.

==Acting career==
Ventura acted in the 1987 movie ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', whose cast included future [[California]] [[List of Governors of California|Governor]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and future [[Kentucky]] [[Governor of Kentucky|Gubernatorial]] candidate [[Sonny Landham]].<ref name=OWOW/> He appeared in two episodes of ''[[Zorro (1990 TV series)|Zorro]]'' filmed in Madrid, Spain in 1991. He had a starring role in the 1990 sci-fi movie ''[[Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe]]'', and supporting roles in ''[[The Running Man (film)|The Running Man]]'', ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'', ''[[Repossessed]]'', ''[[Ricochet (film)|Ricochet]]'', ''[[The Master of Disguise]]'' (in which he steals the [[Liberty Bell]]), and ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' - the first and last of these also starring Schwarzenegger. Ventura also made a cameo appearance in ''[[Major League II]]'', as "White Lightning". He also appeared as a self help guru (voice only) in ''[[The Ringer (film)|The Ringer]]'' trying to turn [[Johnny Knoxville]] into a more confident worker. Ventura also had a cameo in ''[[The X-Files]]'' episode "[[Jose Chung's From Outer Space|Jose Chung's ''From Outer Space'']]" as a [[Men in Black|Man in Black]] alongside fellow 'MiB' [[Alex Trebek]]. In 2008, Ventura filmed the independent comedy ''Woodshop'', starring as a high school shop teacher named Mr. Madson. The film was scheduled for a 2009 release.

==Political career==
===Mayor of Brooklyn Park===
Following his departure from the WWF, Ventura took advice from a former high school teacher and ran for [[mayor]] of [[Brooklyn Park, Minnesota]] in 1990.<ref name="VBot2">Jake Tapper, "Body Slam: The Jesse Ventura Story," pg. 105-108</ref> Ventura defeated the city's 18-year incumbent mayor and served from 1991 to 1995.<ref name="VElec">{{cite web|url=http://www.morris.umn.edu/register/article.php?volume=11&issue=5&section=feature&index=2 |title=Mayor of Brooklyn Park, Jesse Ventura: Reform endorsed candidate |publisher=Morris.umn.edu |author=Carly Skorczewski |date=October 29, 1998 - Volume 11, Issue 5 |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>

===Governor of Minnesota===
{{See also|Minnesota gubernatorial election, 1998}}
Ventura ran for Governor of Minnesota in 1998 as the nominee for the Reform Party of Minnesota (he later joined the [[Independence Party of Minnesota]] when the Reform Party broke from its association with the [[Reform Party of the United States of America]]). His campaign consisted of a combination of aggressive [[grassroots]] events and original television spots, designed by quirky adman [[Bill Hillsman]], using the phrase "Don't vote for politics as usual." He spent considerably less than his opponents (about $300,000) and was a pioneer in his using the [[Internet]] as a medium of reaching out to voters in a political campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howeypolitics.com/2009/06/18/brian-howey-time-to-take-over-the-indiana-libertarian-party/|title=Time to Take Over the Indiana Libertarian Party|author=Howey, Brian|accessdate=2009-06-26|date=June 18, 2009}}</ref>

He won the election in November 1998, narrowly (and unexpectedly) defeating the major-party candidates, [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] mayor [[Norm Coleman]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) and Minnesota [[State Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Skip Humphrey|Hubert H. "Skip" Humphrey III]] ([[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party|Democratic-Farmer-Labor]]). After his victory, bumper stickers and T-shirts bearing the slogan "My governor can beat up your governor" appeared in Minnesota. The nickname "Jesse 'The Mind'" (from a last-minute Hillsman ad featuring Ventura posing as Rodin's ''Thinker'') began to resurface sarcastically in reference to his frequently controversial remarks. Ventura's old stage name "Jesse 'The Body'" (sometimes adapted to "Jesse 'The Governing Body'") also continued to appear with some regularity.

After the legislature refused to increase spending for security, Ventura attracted criticism when he decided not to live in the governor's mansion during his tenure, choosing instead to shut it down and stay at his home in [[Maple Grove, Minnesota|Maple Grove]]. Critics pointed to the loss of jobs for several working-class people at the mansion and the extra cost of reopening the mansion later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E6D71431F932A35756C0A9649C8B63 |title=National Briefing &#124; Midwest: Minnesota: Governor Shuts Mansion - New York Times |publisher=Query.nytimes.com |author=Published: May 1, 2002 |date=Published: May 1, 2002 |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>

In 1999, a group of disgruntled citizens petitioned to recall Governor Ventura, alleging, among other things, that "the use of state security personnel to protect the governor on a book promotion tour constituted illegal use of state property for personal gain." The petition was denied. <ref>In Re Proposed Petition to Recall Governor Jesse Ventura http://wrestlingperspective.com/legal/ventura.html</ref>

During his tenure as Governor, Ventura drew frequent fire from the press in the Twin Cities. He referred to reporters as "media jackals," a term that even appeared on the press passes required to enter the governor's press area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stateline.org/live/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=136&languageId=1&contentId=14279 |title=Provocative Press Pass Miffs Minnesota Media |publisher=Stateline.org |author=Lynda McConnell, Special to Stateline.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref> Shortly after Ventura's election as governor, author and [[List of humorists|humorist]] [[Garrison Keillor]] wrote a [[satire|satirical]] book about the event, spoofing Ventura as "Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente," a self-aggrandizing former "Navy W.A.L.R.U.S. (Water Air Land Rising Up Suddenly)" turned professional wrestler turned politician. Initially, Ventura responded angrily to the satire, but later, in a conciliatory vein, said that Keillor "makes Minnesota proud".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.current.org/people/peop908g.html |title=Current.org &#124; Keillor v. Ventura |publisher=Current.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref> During his term, Ventura appeared on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|The Late Show with]] [[David Letterman]]'', in which he responded controversially to the following question: "So which is the better city of the Twin Cities, Minneapolis or St. Paul?". Ventura responded, "Minneapolis. Those streets in St. Paul must have been designed by drunken Irishmen". He later apologized for the remark, adding that it was not intended to be taken seriously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E3DD173CF935A15751C0A96F958260&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/V/Ventura,%20Jesse |title=Gov. Ventura Stumbles - New York Times |publisher=Query.nytimes.com |author=Published: February 26, 1999 |date=Published: February 26, 1999 |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>

After a [[trade]] mission to [[China]] in 2002, he announced that he would not run for a second term.<ref name=cuba/> He accused the media of hounding him and his family for personal behavior and belief while neglecting coverage of important policy issues. Ventura later told a reporter for ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' that he would have run for a second term if he had been single, citing the media's effect on his family life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/02/25/the_body_politic/ |title=The Body politic - The Boston Globe |publisher=Boston.com |author=Joseph P.

Governor Ventura sparked media criticism when, nearing the end of his term, he suggested that he might resign from office early to allow his lieutenant governor, [[Mae Schunk]], an opportunity to serve as governor. He further stated that he wanted her to be the state's first female governor and have her portrait painted and hung in the Capitol along with the other governors. Ventura quickly retreated from the comments, saying he was just floating an idea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicalwire.com/archives/2002/10/21/ventura_may_leave_office_early.html |title=Ventura May Leave Office Early - Political Wire |publisher=Politicalwire.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>

====Political positions====
{{Refimprove|section|date=August 2007}}
Ventura's main campaign promise was a [[tax refund]]. The state was running a [[budget]] surplus at the time, and Ventura believed that the money should be given back to the public. In [[Leaders debate|political debate]]s, he often admitted that he had not formed an opinion on certain [[policy]] questions. Ventura frequently described himself as "fiscally [[Conservatism|conservative]] and socially [[liberalism|liberal]]."{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} He selected teacher [[Mae Schunk]] as his running mate. His participation in the 1998 Minnesota Governor debates boosted his popularity as a candidate.

Later as governor, he came to support a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] (one-house) [[legislature]], [[light rail]] public transport, [[property tax]] reform, [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]], and [[abortion]] rights. In an interview on ''The Howard Stern Show'', he affirmed his support of gay rights, including gay marriage and gays in the military, stating he would've gladly served alongside homosexuals when he was in the Navy as they would've provided less competition for women.<ref>http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1242705600#14047</ref> While funding [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] education generously, he opposed the teachers' union, and did not have a high regard for the public funding of [[higher education]] institutions. Additionally, Ventura supported the use of [[medicine|medicinal]] [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], advocated a higher role for [[third party (United States)|third parties]] in national politics, and favored the concept of [[instant-runoff voting]].

Lacking a [[political party|party]] base in the [[Minnesota House of Representatives|Minnesota House]] and [[Minnesota Senate|Senate]], Governor Ventura's policy ambitions had little chance of being introduced as bills.  Initially, the residents of Minnesota feared Governor Ventura's [[veto]]es would be overturned.  Ventura vetoed 45 bills in his first year, and only 3 of those vetoes were overridden.  The reputation for having his vetoes overridden comes from his fourth and final year, where 6 of his 9 vetoes were overturned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.mn.us/LRL/Vetoes/Vetohist.asp |title=Minnesota Legislative Reference Library: Bills Vetoed by Governors and Override Attempts, 1939-Present |publisher=Minnesota Legislative Reference Library www.leg.state.mn.us/LRL |date= |accessdate=2009-05-09}}</ref>

Ventura was elected on a Reform party ticket, but he never received support from [[Ross Perot]]'s Texas faction. When the Reform party was taken over by [[Pat Buchanan]] supporters before the [[United States presidential election, 2000|presidential elections of 2000]], Ventura left the party in February 2000, referring to it as 'hopelessly dysfunctional'. However, he maintained close ties to the [[Independence Party of Minnesota]], which also broke from the Reform party around the same time.

During the first part of his administration, Ventura strongly advocated for land-use reform and substantial [[public transport|mass transit]] improvements, such as [[light rail]]. In his March 1999 State address, he proclaimed, "I want to ride a train by 2002," referring to a [[light rail]] line running between downtown [[Minneapolis]] and the [[Mall of America]]. He made the light rail project a priority, obtaining additional funding from the Minnesota state legislature to keep the project moving. The [[Hiawatha Line]] was completed in 2004.

Ventura vetoed a bill to require [[recitation]] of the [[Pledge of Allegiance]] in [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]], saying:
:''' {{quotation|I believe [[patriotism]] comes from the heart. Patriotism is voluntary. It is a feeling of loyalty and [[allegiance]] that is the result of knowledge and belief. A patriot shows their patriotism through their actions, by their choice. No [[law]] will make a [[citizenship|citizen]] a patriot.<ref>{{cite''' web|url=http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=16297 |title=freedomforum.org: Minnesota governor vetoes Pledge of Allegiance requirement |publisher=Freedomforum.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>}}

During another trade mission to [[Cuba]] in the summer of 2002, he denounced the [[economic sanctions]] of the US against that [[country]].<ref name=cuba>{{cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200209/25_khoom_cuba1/ |title=MPR: Ventura begins final foreign journey as governor |publisher=News.minnesota.publicradio.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>

====Wellstone memorial====<!-- This section is linked from [[Walter Mondale]] -->
Ventura greatly disapproved of some of the actions that took place at the 2002 memorial for [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Paul Wellstone]], his family, and others who died in a plane crash on October 25, 2002. Ventura said, "I feel used. I feel violated and duped over the fact that [the memorial ceremony] turned into a [[Demonstration (people)|political rally]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,67075,00.html |title=FOXNews.com - Ventura May Tap Independent to Wellstone's Seat; Mondale Officially in for Dems - Politics &#124; Republican Party &#124; Democratic Party &#124; Political Spectrum |publisher=Foxnews.com |author=E-Mail Respond Print Share: ST.

Jesse Ventura was so offended by the political rally that evolved out of a memorial service to honor Wellstone that he said he will try to appoint an independent instead of a Democrat to fill out Wellstone's term until a replacement is certified. "I feel used. I feel violated and duped over the fact that that turned into nothing more than a political rally ... I think the Democrats should hang their heads in shame," Ventura told Fox News on Wednesday. More than 800 party representatives, in a special meeting, approved Mondale's candidacy with a boisterous "YEA!" There were no dissenters. Mondale was mobbed as he made his way to the podium to speak. "Tonight, our campaign begins," Mondale said. "I start it with a pledge to you. I will be your voice, and I will be Paul Wellstone's voice for decency and better lives." Related Stories Mondale to Replace Wellstone as Senate Candidate Coleman Ready to Win Wellstone Seat Minn.

====Statements====
=====Religion=====
In a ''[[Playboy]]'' interview, he said, "Organized [[religion]] is [[Criticism of religion|a sham]] and a crutch for weak-minded people who need strength in numbers. It tells people to go out and stick their noses in other people's business." In his 1999 best-selling [[memoir]] ''I Ain't Got Time to Bleed'', Ventura responded to the controversy sparked by these remarks by elaborating on his views concerning religion: "I<U+2019>d like to clarify [my comments published in ''Playboy''] about religious people being weak-minded. I didn<U+2019>t mean all religious people. I don<U+2019>t have any problem with the vast majority of religious folks. I count myself among them, more or less. But I believe because it makes sense to me, not because I think it can be proven. There are lots of people out there who think they know the truth about [[God]] and religion, but does anybody really know for sure? That<U+2019>s why the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding fathers]] built [[Freedom of religion|freedom of religious belief]] into the structure of this nation, so that everybody could make up their minds for themselves. But I do have a problem with the people who think they have some right to try to impose their beliefs on others. I hate what the [[fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] [[Fanaticism|fanatics]] are doing to our country. It seems as though, if everybody doesn<U+2019>t accept their version of reality, that somehow invalidates it for them. Everybody must believe the same things they do. That<U+2019>s what I find weak and destructive."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Jesse_Ventura_Principles_+_Values.htm |title=Jesse Ventura on Principles & Values |publisher=Ontheissues.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>

Ventura endorsed [[social equality|equal rights]] for [[minority religion|religious minorities]], as well as people who [[Nontheism|don't believe in God]], by declaring July 4, 2002, "Indivisible Day" through this proclamation:

'''{{quotation|WHEREAS: The unique feature of this nation at its founding was its establishment of a [[secularity|secular]] Constitution that separated government from religion - something never done before; and WHEREAS: Our secular Constitution has enabled people of all worldviews to coexist in harmony, undivided by sectarian strife; and WHEREAS: President [[James Madison]] made clear the importance of maintaining this harmony when he said, "The purpose of [[separation of church and state]] is to keep forever from these shores the endless strife that has soaked the soil of Europe in blood for centuries"; and WHEREAS: The diversity of our people requires mutual respect and equal protection for all our citizens, including minority groups, if we are to remain "One nation, indivisible"; and WHEREAS: It is the unfettered diversity of ideas and worldviews that have made our nation the strongest and most productive in the world; and WHEREAS: Eternal vigilance must be maintained to guard against those who seek to stifle ideas, establish a narrow orthodoxy, and divide our nation along arbitrary lines of race, ethnicity, and religious belief or non-belief. NOW, THEREFORE, I, JESSE VENTURA, Governor of Minnesota, do hereby proclaim that Thursday, July 4, 2002 shall be observed as: INDIVISIBLE DAY In the State Of Minnesota. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}}}'''
Governor Ventura proclaimed October 13<U+2013>19, 2002 as "Christian Heritage Week" in Minnesota.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pewforum.org/news/display.php?ewsID=1402 |title=Religion News |publisher=Pewforum.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E7DF1F3BF931A3575BC0A9649C8B63 |title=National Briefing &#124; Midwest: Minnesota: Christians One Up On Ventura - New York Times |publisher=Query.nytimes.com |author=Jo Napolitano (Nyt) |date=Published: August 2, 2002 |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>

=====Prostitution=====
Ventura has publicly stated that [[prostitution]] should be legal, since it will exist in any case, and legal controls protecting the health of clients and workers are needed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notable-quotes.com/v/ventura_jesse.html |title=Jesse Ventura Quotes |publisher=Notable-quotes.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref> He said "I voted in hopes to make prostitution legal once, and I'd do it again in a second."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mplsmirror.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=218&Itemid=1 |title=mplsmirror.com - Place Pigapolis: Mayor Rybak, Who Needs LGA? |publisher=Mplsmirror.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>

==Other media==
Between 1995 and his run for governor in 1998, Ventura had [[Talk radio|radio call-in shows]] on ([[KFAN (AM)|KFAN]] 1130) and ([[KSTP (AM)|KSTP]] 1500) in [[Minneapolis <U+2013> Saint Paul]]. Jesse had a brief role on the television soap opera ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' in 1999.

Ventura has been criticized for privately profiting from his heightened popularity. He was hired as a television analyst for the failed [[XFL]] [[American football|football]] enterprise, [[SummerSlam (1999)|served as a referee at a World Wrestling Federation match]], and published several books during his tenure as governor. On his weekly radio show, he often criticized the media for focusing on these deals rather than on his [[policy]] proposals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200201/28_khoom_jessereview/ |title=MPR: Ventura - the year in review |publisher=News.minnesota.publicradio.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>

Ventura was succeeded in his office by Republican [[Tim Pawlenty]]. He began a cable television show in October 2003, on [[MSNBC]] called ''Jesse Ventura's America''. The show was broadcast once a week, on Saturdays, unlike many MSNBC shows which are on five nights a week (this show was originally planned for five nights a week as well, but MSNBC executives changed their minds). At the time of its airing, ''Jesse Ventura's America'' was the only national [[television]] show filmed in [[Minnesota]]. Among his guests were [[Charles Barkley]], [[Gray Davis]], [[Arianna Huffington]], [[Rob Kampia]], and Kathy McKee.

In 2004, fellow Navy veteran and [[Harvard University|Harvard]] graduate student Christopher Mora promoted the idea that the academic establishment had failed to reach out to citizens experienced in public service, but who did not fit the traditional idea of a politician. He successfully lobbied for the selection of Ventura, who started teaching a study group at Harvard University for the Spring 2004 semester as a visiting [[fellow]] at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Kennedy School of Government]]'s Institute of Politics (IOP). His 90-minute study group focused on third party politics, campaign finance, the war on drugs, and other relevant political issues. Ventura scheduled multiple famous friends to appear for his seminars including [[Dean Barkley]] and [[Richard Marcinko]].

On October 22, 2004, with Ventura by his side, former [[Maine]] Governor [[Angus King]] endorsed [[John Kerry]] for President at the Minnesota state capitol building. Ventura did not speak at the press conference.  When prodded for a statement, Governor King responded, "He plans to vote for [[John Kerry]], but he doesn't want to make a statement and subject himself to the tender mercies of the Minnesota press".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2004/10/28_mccalluml_venturakerry/ |title=MPR: Speechless no more, Ventura stumps for Kerry at colleges |publisher=News.minnesota.publicradio.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>

In November 2004, an advertisement began airing in [[California]] featuring Ventura. In it, Ventura voices his opposition to Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s policies regarding [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[casino]]s. Like Hogan, Schwarzenegger at one point was also a close friend of Ventura as well, but since Schwarzenegger's victory in California, Ventura has not reportedly given him any praise; Schwarzenegger didn't even mention Ventura's name in an interview with [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] in 2005, where reporter [[Chris Wallace (journalist)|Chris Wallace]] asked him if he was "the next Jesse Ventura".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newshounds.us/2005/05/09/arnold_schwarzenegger_politics_as_movie_script.php |title=News Hounds: Arnold Schwarzenegger: Politics as Movie Script |publisher=Newshounds.us |date= May 9, 2005 |accessdate=2008-10-20 | last= Therese| first=Marie}}</ref> Ventura is serving as an advisory board member for a new group called [[Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America|Operation Truth]], a [[non-profit organization]] set up "to give voice to troops who served in Iraq." <U+201C>The current use of the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] is wrong....These are men who did not sign up to go occupy foreign nations<U+201D>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armytimes.com/story.php?f=1-ARMYPAPER-323322.php |title=Army News, benefits, careers, entertainment, photos, promotions - Army Times HOME |publisher=Armytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>

In August 2005, Ventura became the spokesperson for [[BetUS]], an online [[Sportsbook]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20071015075304/http://www.betus.com/site-siteJesseVideo.asp BetUs Events]</ref> In 2005, Ventura repeatedly discussed leaving the United States. In September 2005, Ventura announced on ''[[The Mike Malloy Show]]'' that he was leaving the U.S. and planned to "have an adventure".  In late October 2005, he went on the ''[[The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch|The Big Idea with]] [[Donny Deutsch]]'' and reiterated that he was leaving the U.S. due to, among other things, [[censorship]]. He has since moved to [[Baja California|Baja California, Mexico]].

In September 2006, Ventura endorsed and campaigned with independent Texas gubernatorial candidate [[Kinky Friedman]], and Independence Party of Minnesota 's gubernatorial candidate [[Peter Hutchinson]] and Team Minnesota. He revealed he now spends much of his time [[surfing]] near his home in [[Mexico]].

In April 2008, a book authored by Ventura, titled ''Don't Start the Revolution Without Me'' was released. In it, Ventura describes a hypothetical campaign in which he is a candidate for [[President of the United States]] in [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]], running as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]]. In an interview with the [[Associated Press]] at the time of the book's release, however, Ventura denied any plans for a presidential bid, stating that the scenario is only imaginary and not indicative of a "secret plan to run".<ref>Freed, Joshua.[http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-03-31-415832547_x.htm "Ventura:No Plans to Run Again, but..."], Associated Press. Accessed on April 1, 2008</ref> On [[MinnPost.com]], Ventura's agent, Steve Schwartz, describes the book thus:
"[Ventura is revealing] why he left politics and discussing the disastrous war in Iraq, why he sees our two-party system as corrupt, and what [[Fidel Castro]] told him about who was really behind the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]]."<ref>[http://www.minnpost.com/joekimball/2007/11/14/96/jesses_back_new_ventura_book_revolution_will_cover_political_waterfront Jesse's back! New Ventura book 'Revolution' will cover political waterfront], [[MinnPost.com]]</ref>

However, in an interview on [[CNN]]'s ''[[The Situation Room]]'' on April 7, Ventura hinted that he was considering entering the [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2008|race for]] the [[United States Senate]] seat then held by Norm Coleman, his Republican opponent in the 1998 Gubernatorial race.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74stuTmkjYc Jesse Ventura Running For The Senate?!], [[YouTube]]</ref> A poll commissioned by [[Minneapolis <U+2013> Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] station [[KMSP-TV|Fox 9]] put him at 24 percent, behind [[Al Franken]] at 32 percent and [[Norm Coleman]] at 39 percent in a hypothetical three-way race. However, Ventura announced on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' on July 14, 2008 that he would not run.<ref>{{cite web |last=Falcone |first=Michael |title=Ventura Decides Against Senate Run |work=The Caucus |publisher=New York Times |date=2008-07-14 |url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/14/ventura-decides-against-senate-run/ |accessdate=2008-07-14 }}</ref>

He spoke at former Republican presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]]'s "[[Campaign for Liberty#Rally for the Republic|Rally for the Republic]]", organized by the [[Campaign for Liberty]], on September 2, 2008. At the event, Ventura implied a possible future run at the U.S. Presidency. Ventura stated before a live audience that "If America proves itself worthy, in [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012]] we'll give them a race they'll never forget!"

[[TV Week]] is reporting that Ventura is in negotiations with [[20th Television]] to host a half-hour [[court]] show that would debut in the fall of 2009.<ref>[http://wcco.com/entertainment/jesse.ventura.television.2.797838.html Ventura In Talks To Host Court Show], [[WCCO-TV|WCCO]].com</ref>

On December 2, 2009, Ventura appeared on the [[Opie and Anthony]] show, where he expressed doubt about the U.S. government's account of the [[September 11 attacks]]. The conversation with Jim Norton grew heated and Ventura walked out of the show.<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/02/jesse-ventura-storms-out_n_377780.html</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Huff|first=Richard|title=Jesse Ventura walks off 'Opie & Anthony' show after verbal mud fest with Jim Norton|journal=New York Daily News|date=December 3, 2009|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/12/03/2009-12-03_jesse_ventura_walks_off.html|accessdate=December 13, 2009}}</ref>

===Bush/Cheney administration and torture===
In a May 11, 2009 interview with [[Larry King]], Ventura twice stated that [[George W. Bush]] was the worst president of his lifetime, adding "[[Barack Obama|President Obama]] inherited something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. You know? Two wars, an economy that's borderline depression."<ref>[http://videocafe.crooksandliars.com/heather/jesse-ventura-you-give-me-water-board-dick Jesse Ventura: You Give Me a Water Board, [[Dick Cheney]] and One Hour, and I'll Have Him Confess to the Sharon Tate Murders], [[Crooks and Liars|CrooksAndLiars.com]]</ref>  On the issue of waterboarding, Ventura added'''''':{{quotation|[I]t's a good thing I'm not president because I would prosecute every person that was involved in that torture. I would prosecute the people that did it. I would prosecute the people that ordered it. Because torture is against the law. ... [Waterboarding] is drowning.

It is no good, because you{{mdash}}I'll put it to you this way, you give me a water board, [[Dick Cheney]] and one hour, and I'll have him confess to the [[Sharon Tate]] murders. ...

Ventura then stated that he had no respect for Dick Cheney because he is "a guy who got five deferments from the [[Vietnam War]]. Clearly, he's a coward. He wouldn't go when it was his time to go. And now he is a [[Chickenhawk (politics)|chickenhawk]]. Now he is this big tough guy who wants this hardcore policy. And he's the guy that sanctioned all this torture by calling it 'enhanced interrogation'."<ref name="videocafe.crooksandliars.com"/> Ventura also expressed interest in being appointed ambassador to Cuba should U.S. relations with Cuba continue to improve.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ujv-x6wGoGA</ref>
On a May 18, 2009 appearance on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', Ventura asked [[Elisabeth Hasselbeck]] if waterboarding is acceptable, why were not [[Oklahoma City bombing|Oklahoma City bombers]], [[Timothy McVeigh]] and [[Terry Nichols]] waterboarded.  "We only seem to waterboard Muslims."<ref name="huffingtonpost.com">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/18/ventura-and-hasselbeck-de_n_204774.html ''Ventura And Hasselbeck Rumble Over Waterboarding On The View'']</ref>  Comparing the waterboarding of detainees to the [[North Vietnam]]ese torture of American [[prisoner of war|P.O.W.s]], Ventura asserted, "We created our own [[Hanoi Hilton]] in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guant<U+00E1>namo]]. That's our Hanoi Hilton."<ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/> "'Enhanced interrogation' is Dick Cheney changing a word. Dick Cheney changed a word to cover his ass."<ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/>
On May 20, 2009, Ventura appeared on ''[[Fox & Friends]]''.  When [[Brian Kilmeade]] told Ventura that he would stop supporting waterboarding when "they're dead."  Ventura responded, "Really? Have you enlisted? Have you enlisted or are you just talking?... Go walk the walk, don't talk the talk."<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/20/jesse-ventura-lays-waste_n_205962.html Jesse Ventura Lays Waste To Fox And Friends]</ref> After Ventura quoted [[Thomas Jefferson]] in saying that dissent is the highest form of patriotism, Kilmeade walked off the set.

===Questions regarding 9/11===
In April and May 2008, Jesse Ventura, in several radio interviews for his new book, ''Don't Start the Revolution Without Me'', expressed concerns about what he described as some of the unanswered questions of the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref>[http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1211342400#11961 Jesse The Body Sounds Off], howardstern.com, May21, 2008</ref>  His remarks about the possibility that the [[World Trade Center controlled demolition conspiracy theories<U+200E>|World Trade Center was demolished with explosives]] were also repeated in newspaper and television stories following some of the interviews.<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.kxmc.com/News/225221.asp Ventura says he regrets initial acceptance of 9/11 explanations], Associated Press, April 3, 2008</ref>

Ventura was interviewed on the [[Alex Jones (radio)|Alex Jones]] radio show on April 2, 2008, on [[Opie and Anthony]] on April 8, 2008, and on the ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' on May 21, 2008, discussing his views on 9/11 with the shows' hosts.<ref>Watson, Paul Joseph.

He also states the Twin Towers appeared to be pulverized to dust, that they fell at virtually free-fall speed, and that  no other massive steel-framed buildings had ever collapsed in this manner due to fire before.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

''''''On May 18, 2009, when asked by [[Sean Hannity]] of Fox News, how George W. Bush could have avoided the attacks of September 11, 2001, Ventura answered, "Well, you pay attention to [[Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US|memos on August 6th]] that tell you exactly what [[Osama bin Laden|bin Laden]]'s gonna do."<''''''Bold''' text'''ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/19/jesse-ventura-gets-in-the_n_205146.html Jesse Ventura, Hannity Go Head-To-Head]</ref>

===''Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura''===
In August 2009, it was announced that Ventura would host [[TruTV]]'s new show ''[[Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura]]''.<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/30/jesse-ventura-working-on_n_130477.html</ref> "Ventura will hunt down answers, plunging viewers into a world of secret meetings, midnight surveillance, shifty characters and dark forces," truTV said in a statement. On the program, which debuted on December 2, 2009, Ventura travels the country, investigating cases and getting input from believers and skeptics before passing judgment on a theory's validity.<ref>[http://news.turner.com/press_kits.cfm?presskit_id=163 "TruTv:Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura"], www.turner.com. Retrieved on November 4, 2009.</ref> According to TruTV, the first episode drew 1.6 million viewers, a record for a new series on the network.

On the show which aired the evening of 23 Dec 2009, host Jesse Ventura said:

{{quotation|About a month after I was elected governor, I was requested into the basement of the capitol to be interviewed by twenty-three members of the Central Intelligence Agency, the CIA. They were very formal, it was 'governor,' 'sir,' and all that. But they put me in a chair and they were in a big half-moon around me. And I said to them, "Look before I answer any of your questions, I want to know what you're doing here." Because in the CIA mission statement it says that they're not to be operational inside the United States of America. Well, they wouldn't really give me an answer on that. And then I said, "I want to go around the room, and I want each one of you to tell me your name and what you do." Half of them wouldn't. Now isn't that bizarre? I'm the governor, and these guys won't even answer questions from me. Then they started questioning me, and it was all about how I got elected; And you know what the most bizarre thing about it was? There was every array of person you could imagine: Young people, old people, all nationalities -- And that's what really got to me: These were people that you would see every day. They look like your neighbors.}}

==Personal life==
In 1975, Ventura married his wife Terry. The couple have two grown children: a son, Tyrel (b. 1980), who is a movie and television director and producer,<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1016961/ Imbd:Tyrel Ventura], www.imdb.com.</ref> and a daughter, Jade (b. 1983).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001818/bio |title=Jesse Ventura - Biography |publisher=Imdb.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>

During his wrestling days, Ventura used [[anabolic steroid]]s. He admitted this after retiring from competition, and went on to make public service announcements and appear in printed ads and on posters warning young people about the potential dangers and potential health risks of abusing steroids.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ThisWeek/ucm117728.htm |title=This Week In FDA History |publisher=Fda.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-07-06}}</ref>

In 2002, Ventura was hospitalized for a severe blood clot in his lungs, the same kind of injury that ended his wrestling career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/07/09/ventura/index.html |title=CNN.com - Ventura hospitalized with blood clot in lung - July 9, 2002 |publisher=Archives.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>
