The following is a '''comparison of e-book formats''' used to create and publish [[e-book]]s. 

A writer or publisher has many options when it comes to choosing a [[document file format|format]] for production. While the average end-user might arguably simply want to read books, every format has its proponents and champions, and debates over "which format is best" can become intense. The myriad of e-book formats is sometimes referred to as the "Tower of eBabel". For the average end user to read a book, every format has its advantages and disadvantages. 

==Formats==
Formats available include, but are by no means limited to:

===Plain text files ===
{| style="text-align:left;"
|-
| style="background:#dddddd; width:100px;" | ''Format'':
| text 
|-
| style="background:#dddddd;" | ''Published as'':
| .txt
|-
|}
E-books in [[text file|plain text]] exist and are very small in size. For example, the [[Bible]] is about 4 MB. The ASCII standard allows ASCII-only text files (unlike most other file types) to be  interchanged and readable on Unix, Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, DOS, and other systems. These differ in their preferred line ending convention and their interpretation of values outside the ASCII range (their character encoding).

===Hypertext Markup Language ===
{| style="text-align:left;"
|-
| style="background:#dddddd; width:100px;" | ''Format'':
| Hypertext
|-
| style="background:#dddddd;" | ''Published as'':
| .htm; .html
|-
|}
[[HTML]] is the [[markup language]] used for most [[World Wide Web|web]] pages. E-books using HTML can be read using a [[Web browser]]. The specifications to the format are  available without charge from the [[W3C]].

As markup language, HTML adds especially marked meta elements to otherwise plain text encoded using [[character set]]s like [[ASCII]] or [[UTF-8]]. As such suitably formatted files can be, and sometimes are, generated ''by hand'' using a ''plain text editor'' or ''programmer's editor''. Many ''HTML generator'' applications exist to ease this process and often require less intricate knowledge of the format details involved.

HTML on its own is not a particularly efficient format to store information, requiring more storage space for a given work than many other formats. However, several e-Book formats including the Amazon Kindle, Open eBook, Compressed HM,  Mobipocket and IDPF/EPUB use one HTML file for each book chapter and then Zip compress the files, along with images, metadata and style sheets into one file.

===Amazon Kindle ===
{| style="text-align:left;"
|-
| style="background:#dddddd; width:100px;" | ''Format'':
| Kindle
|-
| style="background:#dddddd;" | ''Published as'':
| .azw
|-
|}
With the launch of the [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] eBook reader, [[Amazon.com]] created the AZW format.  It is based on the [[Mobipocket]] standard, with a slightly different serial number scheme (it uses an [[asterisk]] instead of a [[Dollar sign]]) and its own [[DRM]] formatting.  Because the eBooks bought on the Kindle are delivered wirelessly over EvDO (the system is called Whispernet by Amazon), the user does not see the AZW files during the download process.

===Open Electronic Package===
{| style="text-align:left;"
|-
| style="background:#dddddd; width:100px;" | ''Format'':
| Open eBook
|-
| style="background:#dddddd;" | ''Published as'':

|-
|}

[[Open eBook|OPF]] is an [[XML]]-based e-book format created by E-Book Systems.

===TomeRaider ===
{| style="text-align:left;"
|-
| style="background:#dddddd; width:100px;" | ''Format'':
| TomeRaider
|-
| style="background:#dddddd;" | ''Published as'':
| .tr2; .tr3
|-
|}

The [[TomeRaider]] e-book format is a proprietary format. There are versions of [[TomeRaider]] for Windows, Windows Mobile (aka Pocket PC), Palm, Symbian, iPhone and more{{specify}}. Several Wikipedias are available as [[Wikipedia:TomeRaider database|TomeRaider files]] with all articles unabridged, some even with nearly all images. Capabilities of the TomeRaider3 ebook reader vary considerably per platform: the Windows and Windows Mobile editions support full [[HTML]] and [[CSS]]. The Palm edition supports limited HTML (e.g., no tables, no fonts), and CSS support is missing. For Symbian there is only the older TomeRaider2  format, which does not render images or offer category search facilities. Despite these differences any TomeRaider ebook can be browsed on all supported platforms.  The Tomeraider website<ref>http://www.tomeraider.com/</ref> claims to have over 4000 ebooks available, including free versions of the [[Internet Movie Database]] and [[Wikipedia]].

===Arghos Diffusion ===
{| style="text-align:left;"
|-
| style="background:#dddddd; width:100px;" | ''Format'':
| Arghos Diffusion
|-
| style="background:#dddddd;" | ''Published as'':
| .arg
|-
|}

The ARG format is an XML-based proprietary format developed by the French firm [[Arghos Diffusion]]. ARG files use a proprietary DRM and encryption method and are readable only in the ''Arghos Player''. It supports various input formats for text, audio or video, such as PDF, WMA, MP3, WMV, and allows multiple interactive functions such as bookmarking, advanced plain-text searching, dynamic text highlighting, etc.

===Flip Books ===
{| style="text-align:left;"
|-
| style="background:#dddddd; width:100px;" | ''Format'':
| Interaxive media
|-
| style="background:#dddddd;" | ''Published as'':

|-
|}
A "Flip Book" is a type of E-Book distinguished by virtual pages that actually "flip", much like turning pages of paper in a real book or magazine. The first dynamic Flip Book Reader was developed in 2003/2004 by Interaxive Media for Nishe Media (Canada) and was therefore called "Nishe Pages".  The first version was produced in part by Cybaris (Canada) and was first publicly showcased in August 2004.  Soon thereafter, many copycat "flip books" started appearing thanks to technological advances in Macromedia Flash, mostly hardcoded using Flash components. 

The original software remains unique in that it is powered by a complete server-based CMS system that allows the books to be created, published, and viewed remotely from a web server without requiring any custom software to be installed.  Nishe Media went defunct in 2004, leaving the unfinished software to Interaxive Media who continued its development in Hong Kong.  Though not widely used outside of Asia, it is now at version 3.0 and can be a server-based E-Book platform. It remains privately held by the original developer, Ryan Sutherland, owner and founder of Interaxive Media.

CHM format is a proprietary format based on HTML. Multiple pages and embedded graphics are distributed along with proprietary [[metadata]] as a single compressed file.  In contrast, in HTML, a site consists of multiple HTML files and associated image files in standardized formats.

===Portable Document===
{| style="text-align:left;"
|-
| style="background:#dddddd; width:100px;" | ''Format'':
| Adobe Portable Document
|-
| style="background:#dddddd;" | ''Published as'':
| .[[Portable Document Format|pdf]]
|-
|}
A file format created by [[Adobe Systems]], initially to provide a standard form for storing and editing printed publishable documents. The format derives from [[PostScript]], but without language features like loops, and with added support for features like compression and passwords. Because PDF documents can easily be viewed and printed by users on a variety of computer [[Platform (computing)|platforms]], they are very common on the [[World Wide Web]]. The specification of the format is available without charge from Adobe.

PDF files typically contain brochures, product manuals, magazine articles <U+2014> up to entire books, as they can embed fonts, images, and other documents. A PDF file contains one or more zoomable page images.

Since the format is designed to reproduce page images, the text traditionally could not be re-flowed to fit the screen width or size. As a result PDF files designed for printing on standard paper sizes are less easily viewed on screens with limited size or resolution, such as those found on mobile phones and [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDAs]]. Adobe has addressed this by adding a re-flow facility to its Acrobat Reader software, but for this to work the document must be marked for re-flowing at creation <ref>http://www.adobe.com/ap/epaper/tips/acr5reflow/index.html Reflow the contents of Adobe PDF documents: Tutorial</ref>, which means existing PDF documents will not benefit unless they are tagged and resaved. The Windows Mobile (aka Pocket PC) version of Adobe Acrobat will automatically attempt to tag a PDF for reflow during the synchronization process using an installed plugin to Active Sync. However, this tagging process will not work on most locked or password protected PDF documents. It also doesn't work at present (2009-10) on the Windows Mobile Device Center (Active Syncs Successor) as found in Windows Vista and Windows 7. This limits automatic tagging support during synchronization to Windows XP/2000. 

Multiple products support creating and tagging PDF files, such as Adobe Acrobat, [[PDFCreator]], [[OpenOffice.org]], and [[Formatting Objects Processor|FOP]], and several programming libraries<!-- somebody add an appropriate link to this concept -->. [[Adobe Acrobat|Acrobat Reader]] (now simply called ''Adobe Reader'') is Adobe's product used to view PDF files, with third party viewers such as [[xpdf]] also available. Mac OS X has built-in PDF support, both for creation as part of the printing system and for display using the built-in Preview application.

Later versions of the specification add support for forms, comments, [[Hyperlink|hypertext links]], and even interactive elements such as buttons for forms entry and for triggering sound and video. Such features may not be supported by older or third-party viewers and some are not transferrable to print.

PDF files are supported on the following e-book readers: iRex iLiad, iRex DR1000, Sony Reader, Bookeen Cybook, [[Foxit Reader|Foxit]] eSlick, Amazon Kindle DX and Barnes & Noble nook.

===PostScript ===
{| style="text-align:left;"

| PostScript 
|-
| style="background:#dddddd;" | ''Published as'':

|-
|}
[[PostScript]] is a [[page description language]] used in the electronic and [[desktop publishing]] areas for defining the contents and layout of a printed page, which can be used by a rendering program to assemble and create the actual output [[Raster graphics|bitmap]]. Many office printers directly support interpreting PostScript and printing the result. As a result, the format also sees wide use in the [[Unix]] world.<!-- IE if you don't want to fool around with output filters, ghostscript, and whatnot, get a postscript printer. Most unix programs with specialised ``print'' functions output ps anyway (pity the firefox print renderer sucks so much). Don't see a way to comment on that here so left in a comment. Would be nice if (the higher end) ebook readers would add a ps interpreter, though -->

===DjVu ===

| style="background:#dddddd; width:100px;" | ''Format'':
| DjVu 
|-
| style="background:#dddddd;" | ''Published as'':
| .[[DjVu|djvu]]
|-
|}
DjVu is a format that specialises in and particularly excels at storing scanned images. It includes advanced compressors optimized for low-color images, such as text documents. Individual files may contain one or more pages.

The format has long remained in obscurity, but now that free tools to manipulate the format are available, that is starting to change.

The contained page images are divided in separate layers (such as multi-color, low-resolution, lossily-compressed background layer, and few-colors, high-resolution, tightly-compressed foreground layer), each compressed in the best available method. The format is designed to decompress very quickly, even faster than vector-based formats.

The advantage of DjVu is that it is possible to take a high-resolution scan (300-400 DPI), good enough for both on-[[screen reading]] and printing, and store it very efficiently. Several dozens of 300 DPI black-and-white scans can be stored in less than a megabyte.

===Microsoft LIT ===

| style="background:#dddddd; width:100px;" | ''Format'':
| Microsoft Reader
|-
| style="background:#dddddd;" | ''Published as'':

|-
|}
DRM-protected LIT files are only readable in the proprietary [[Microsoft Reader]] program, as the .LIT format, otherwise similar to Microsoft's [[Microsoft Compiled HTML Help|CHM]] format, includes [[Digital Rights Management]] features. Other third party readers, such as [[Lexcycle Stanza]], can read unprotected LIT files. There are also tools such as [http://www.convertlit.com Convert Lit], which can convert [[LIT (file format)|.lit]] files to HTML files or [[OEBPS]] files.

The Microsoft Reader uses patented [[ClearType]] display technology. In Reader navigation works with a keyboard, mouse, stylus, or through electronic bookmarks. The Catalogue Library records reader books in a personalized "home page", and books are displayed with ClearType to improve readability.  A user can add annotations and notes to any page, create large-print e-books with a single command, or create free-form drawings on the reader pages.  A built-in dictionary allows the user to look up words.

eReader is a [[freeware]] program for viewing Palm Digital Media electronic books. Versions are available for [[iPhone]], [[PalmOS]], [[Symbian]], [[BlackBerry]], [[Windows Mobile]] Pocket PC/Smartphone, desktop [[Windows]], and [[Macintosh]]. The reader shows text one page at a time, as paper books do. eReader supports embedded hyperlinks and images. Additionally, the [[Lexcycle Stanza|Stanza]] application for the [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]] can read both [[encryption|encrypted]] and unencrypted eReader files.

The [http://www.ereader.com/ company's web site - ereader.com] maintains a wide selection of eReader-formatted ebooks, available for purchase and download, with a small number of titles for free. ([[Public domain]]) The paid-for books are  [[encryption|encrypted]], with the [[key (cryptography)|key]] being the purchaser's full name and credit card number. This information is not preserved in the ebook. A [[Cryptographic hash function|one-way hash]] is used, so there no risk of the user's information being extracted.

The program supports features like bookmarks and footnotes, enabling the user to mark any page with a bookmark, and any part of the text with a footnote-like commentary. Footnotes can later be exported as a Memo document.

The company also offers two Windows/MacOS programs for producing ebooks: the free [http://secure.ereader.com/ereader/software/product/15099_dropbook_win.htm Dropbook], and the paid-for [http://secure.ereader.com/ereader/software/product/15001_eBookstudio_win.htm eBook Studio]. Dropbook is simply a file-oriented PML-to-[[PDB (Palm OS)|PDB]] converter, and eBook Studio incorporates a [[WYSIWYG]] editor. PML (Palm Markup Language) is  basically text with embedded formatting tags, so feeding a pure text file into eBook Studio or Dropbook also works.

There is also support for an integrated reference dictionary (with many options up to and including a 476,000-word Merriam-Webster Dictionary, including pronunciation keys) so that any word in the text can be highlighted and looked up on the dictionary instantly. Commercial fonts can also be individually purchased and downloaded at the [http://www.ereader.com/ company's web site, ereader.com].

On [[July 20]], [[2009]], [[Barnes & Noble]] announced<ref>[http://www.barnesandnobleinc.com/press_releases/2009_july_20_ebookstore.html Barnes & Noble Launches World's Largest eBookstore]</ref> that the eReader format would be the method they use to deliver eBooks.  Updated versions of the Palm Digital programs for Apple iPhone/Touch, Blackberry,   Mac OS X, and Windows platforms were made available on the [http://www.barnesandnoble.com/ebooks/ Barnes & Noble eBooks website].

On [[October 20]], [[2009]], [[Barnes & Noble]] announced<ref>[http://www.barnesandnoble.com/nook/compare/ Nook Help and FAQs, eBook Reader, eBook Device - Barnes & Noble]</ref> their Nook Reader will support the eReader format.

Desktop Author is an electronic publishing suite that allows creation of digital web books with virtual turning pages. Digital web books of any publication type can be written in this format, including brochures, e-books, digital photo albums, e-cards, digital diaries, online resumes, quizzes, exams, tests, forms and surveys. DesktopAuthor packages the e-book into a ".dnl" or ".exe" book. Each can be a single, plain [[stand-alone]] executable file which does not require any other programs to view it. DNL files can be viewed inside a web browser or stand-alone via the ''DNL Reader''.

DNL format is an e-Book format, one which replicates the real life alternative, namely page turning Books. The DNL e-Book is developed by [[DNAML Pty Limited]] an Australian company established in 1999. A DNL e-Book can be produced using DeskTop Author or DeskTop Communicator.

Commonly known as an [[Apple Newton]] book; a single Newton package file can contain multiple books (for example, the three books of a trilogy might be packaged together). All systems running the Newton operating system (the most common include the Newton MessagePads, eMates, Siemens Secretary Stations, Motorola Marcos, Digital Ocean Seahorses and Tarpons) have built-in support for viewing Newton books. The Newton package format was released to the public by Newton, Inc. prior to that company's absorption into Apple Computer. The format is thus arguably open and various people have written readers for it (writing a Newton book converter has even been assigned as a university-level class project<ref>[http://metcs.bu.edu/~feneric/cs331/Archives/Project2002/]</ref>).

Newton books have no support for DRM or encryption. They do support internal links, potentially multiple tables of contents and indexes, embedded grayscale images, and even some scripting capability (for example, it's possible to make a book in which the reader can influence the outcome)<ref>http://tools.unna.org/wikiwikinewt/index.php/MakeNewtonEbooksIndex</ref>. Newton books utilize [[Unicode]] and are thus available in numerous languages. An individual [[Newton book]] may actually contain multiple views representing the same content in different ways (such as for different screen resolutions).

The [[Mobipocket]]  Reader has a home page library. Readers can add blank pages in any part of a book and add free-hand drawings. Annotations &mdash; highlights, bookmarks, corrections, notes, and drawings &mdash; can be applied, organized, and recalled from a single location. [[Mobipocket]] Reader has electronic bookmarks,  and a built-in dictionary

The reader has a full screen mode for reading and support for many [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], [[Communicator]]s, and [[Smartphone]]s. [[Mobipocket]] products support most Windows, Symbian, BlackBerry and Palm operating systems. On Linux and Macintosh applications like [[Okular]] and [[FBReader]] can be used to read non-encrypted files.

The Amazon Kindle's AZW format is basically just the Mobipocket format with a slightly different serial number scheme (it uses an asterisk instead of a [[Dollar sign]]).

The .epub or [[OEBPS]] format is an open standard for eBooks created by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). It combines three IDPF open standards:
* Open Publication Structure (OPS) 2.0, which describes the content markup (either XHTML or Daisy DTBook)
* Open Packaging Format (OPF) 2.0, which describes the structure of an .epub in XML
* OEBPS Container Format (OCF) 1.0, which bundles files together (as a renamed ZIP file)

Currently, the format can be read by the Sony Reader, BeBook, [[Adobe Digital Editions]], [[Lexcycle Stanza]], BookGlutton, AZARDI, [[Aldiko]] and [[WordPlayer]] on Android and the [[Mozilla Firefox]] [[Add-on (Mozilla)|add-on]] [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5275 OpenBerg Lector].

A Multimedia EBook is [[media (communication)|media]] and [[book]] [[content (media and publishing)|content]] that utilizes a combination of different book [[content format|content forms]]. The term can be used as a noun (a medium with multiple content forms) or as an adjective describing a medium as having multiple content forms. Currently, configuration of several forms of media is possible only on the basis of technology [[Adobe Flash]]. The technique of a [[Flip Book]] is applied to preservation sequences statements of the traditional book.<ref>One such type is published by eveda.org.</ref>

The 'multimedia eBook' term is used in contrast to media which only utilize traditional forms of printed or text book. Multimedia EBook includes a combination of [[Writing|text]], [[Sound|audio]], [[image|still images]], [[animation]], [[Footage|video]], and [[interactivity]] content forms. The formats used to create a [[literary]] [[fiction]] book somteimes have an addition of an audio-visual element and interactive contents allowing new form of creativity. The user (eg., reader) has an opportunity to participate in events occurring to characters, to feel influence of a musical part of a narration and graphic part. The perception of several media forms of contents considerably expands depth of transfer power of [[art]] and [[creativity]].
