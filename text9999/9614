The steamboat '''Elfin''' operated on [[Lake Washington]] and [[Puget Sound]] from 1891 to 1900.  The vessel served as an important transportation link in the area when roads and railways were poor or non-existent, and there were no bridges across the lake.

==Construction and launching==
''Elfin'' was built at Pontiac, on the north side of [[Sand Point]], on Lake Washington in 1891.  The vessel was {{convert|54.5|ft|m|2|lk=on}}<ref name = McCurdy/> ( or {{convert|60|ft|m|2|lk=on}})<ref name = Lange/>) long, with a beam of {{convert|13.5|ft|m|2|lk=on}}.  Power was provided by a two cylinder compound [[steam engine]].  The builder was Edward.F. Lee.  The first owner was Capt. Frank Curtis, whose prior vessel, the [[Squak (steamboat)|''Squak'']], had been sunk in a storm during Christmas, 1890.<ref name = Lange/>   The vessel was launched in April 1891.  Other steamers on the lake, [[Kirkland (sidewheeler)|''Kirkland'']], and [[Mary Kraft|''Mary Kraft'']] brought spectators to the launching.<ref name = Lange/> 

== Operations ==

''Elfin'' first carried passengers on July 4, 1891.<ref name = Lange/>  Frank Curtis was in charge, with his sons Al and Walter as mate and deckhand.  Irving Leake was the engineer.<ref name = Lange/>  ''Elfin'' made six round trips per day, starting at 7:10 a.m from Yarrow Bay (then called Northup<U+2019>s Landing}, to [[Kirkland, Washington|Kirkland]] then Houghton,  and then west across the lake to to the foot of Seattle<U+2019>s Madison street.  Fares were 10 cents each way.  In the first two years, the most passengers transported in a single day were 180. Average monthly passengers in the first half of 1892 were 1,070 a month.<ref name = Lange/>

In 1896 the vessel' s capacity was expanded, and the [[pilot house]] was moved to the [[boat deck]].<ref name = McCurdy/>

==Destruction and partial salvage ==
Early in the morning on December 2, 1900, while moored at a dock, ''Elfin'' was destroyed in a fire.  The machinery was salvaged, to be installed in a new vessel, [[Peerless (steamboat)|''Peerless'']].<ref name = McCurdy/>
