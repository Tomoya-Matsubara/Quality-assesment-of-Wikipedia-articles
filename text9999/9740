'''USCGC ''Point Marone'' (WPB-82331)''' was an 82 foot [[United States Coast Guard|USCG]] {{sclass|Point|cutter||boat}} constructed at the [[United States Coast Guard Yard|Coast Guard Yard]] at [[Curtis Bay, Maryland]] in 1962 for use as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. Since the Coast Guard policy in 1962 was not to name cutters under 100 feet in length it was designated as ''WPB-82331'' when commissioned and acquired the name ''Point Marone'' in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than 65 feet.<ref name="USCG">[http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Point_Class_WPB_Index.asp Coast Guard Historian website] </ref><ref name="Scheina"> Robert L. Scheina, U.S. Coast Guard Cutters & Craft, 1946-1990, Naval Institute Press, 1990 ISBN 0-87021-719-4</ref>

==Construction details==

''Point Marone'' was built with a mild steel hull and an aluminum superstructure that could accommodate an 8 man crew. She was powered by two 600 horsepower VT600 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had twin propellers. Longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Fuel tank capacity was 1840 gallons at 95% full.<ref name="USCG" /><ref name="Scheina" />

==History==

After delivery in 1962, ''Point Marone'' was assigned a homeport of [[San Pedro, California]], where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. <ref name="USCG" />

At the request of the [[United States Navy]], in April 1965, she was alerted for service in [[Vietnam]] and assigned to [[Coast Guard Squadron One]] in support of [[Operation Market Time]] along with 16 other Point class cutters.<ref name="Larzelere"> Alex Larzelere, The Coast Guard at War, Vietnam, 1965-1975, Naval Institute Press, 1997 ISBN 1-55750-529-2 </ref> <ref name="Cutler"> Thomas J. Cutler, Brown Water, Black Berets Naval Institute Press, 1988 0-87021-011-4 </ref> While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at [[Coast Guard Island]] and [[Parks Reserve Forces Training Area|Camp Parks, California]], ''Point Marone'' was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to [[Subic Bay]], [[Philippines]] in May 1965 where she was refit for combat service.<ref name="USCG2">[http://www.uscg.mil/history/uscghist/VietnamPhotoIndex_A.asp Coast Guard Historian photos website] </ref> Shipyard modifications included installation of new single-sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, bunks, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of four [[M2 Browning machine gun|M-2 machine guns]]. The original bow mounted machine gun was replaced with a combination over-under .50 caliber machine gun/81 mm trigger fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in Vietnam.<ref name="USCG2" /><ref name="Larzelere" /><ref name="Cutler" />  For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the crew complement to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea. 

''Point Marone'' was assigned to Division 11 of Squadron One to be based at An Thoi, a small fishing village on the southern tip of [[Ph<U+00FA> Qu<U+1ED1>c]] Island along with {{Ship|USCGC|Point Banks|WPB-82327|2}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Point Clear|WPB-82315|2}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Point Comfort|WPB-82317|2}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Point Garnet|WPB-82310|2}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Point Glover|WPB-82307|2}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Point Grey|WPB-82324|2}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Point Mast|WPB-82316|2}} and {{Ship|USCGC|Point Young|WPB-82303|2}}. After sea trials, the Division left Subic Bay for Phu Quoc on 17 July 1965 in the company of {{USS|Floyd County|LST-762}}, their temporary support ship. After almost two weeks at sea, they arrived at their new duty station  on 1 August and began patrolling the waters in the [[Gulf of Thailand]] near the [[C<U+00E0> Mau Peninsula]].<ref name="Larzelere" /> Duty consisted of boarding Vietnamese junks to search for contraband weapons and ammunition and check the identification papers of persons on board. During September 1965, {{USS|Krishna|ARL-38}}, a repair ship outfitted for the repair of WPB's  relieved the USS ''Floyd County''. Also during this time, the WPB's were directed to paint the hulls and superstructures formula 20 deck gray to cover the stateside white paint. This increased the effectiveness of night patrols.<ref name="Larzelere" />

While on patrol in the Gulf of Thailand near the Cambodian border on the night of 19 September 1965 ''Point Marone'' intercepted a suspicious junk operating near [[Ha Tien]] and warned it to stop for boarding. After receiving fire from the junk she returned fire, and with assistance from ''Point Glover'' they sank the junk in fifteen feet of water. After the junk was recovered the following day, rifles, grenades, ammunition and documents were discovered. The only survivor of the crew of the junk provided intelligence which led to a raid on [[Hon Mot]] that was conducted on 26 September. ''Point Marone'' participated in the raid along with cutters ''Point Comfort'' and ''Point Grey'' by transporting civilian irregular defense group ([[CIDG]]) mercenaries and their [[U.S. Army Special Forces|Special Forces]] advisors to the raid and providing fire support with the 81 mm mortar.<ref name="Larzelere" /><ref name="Cutler" />

On 4 August 1970, ''Point Marone'' and {{Ship|USCGC|Point Cypress|WPB-82326|2}}, conducted the last mission for Squadron One on the [[Co Chien River]]. The cutters each carried fifty [[Kit Carson Scouts]] and their [[ARVN]] advisors along with the full 13 man [[South Vietnamese Navy]] replacement crew aboard for their final check ride for the [[Vietnamization]] program In one of the canals that intersected with the river ''Point Marone'' hit a command detonated mine wounding several on board and causing several holes below the waterline. The mission was cancelled and ''Point Cypress'' escorted her back to the base at [[Cat Lo]].<ref name="Larzelere" />

On 15 August 1970, ''Point Marone'' along with ''Point Cypress'' were turned over to the South Vietnamese Navy as part of the "[[Vietnamization]]" of the war effort; the last two of the 26 Point class cutters assigned to Squadron One. ''Point Marone'' was  recommissioned as ''HQ-724''.<ref name="USCG" /><ref name="Cutler" />
