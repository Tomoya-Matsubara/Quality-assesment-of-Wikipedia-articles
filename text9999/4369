Disposiciones generales: [http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2006/10/31/pdfs/A37742-37743.pdf 18869 Ley 33/2006], Articulo 1, Articulo 2, Disposici<U+00F3>n transitoria unica'' <U+00A7>3</ref>

==Birth and youth==
She was born in the [[Palacio Real de El Pardo]] in Madrid and is the daughter of [[Crist<U+00F3>bal Mart<U+00ED>nez-Bordi<U+00FA>|Crist<U+00F3>bal Mart<U+00ED>nez-Bordi<U+00FA>, 10th Marquess of Villaverde]], and [[Carmen Franco, 1st Duchess of Franco|Carmen Franco y Polo]], 1st [[Duke of Franco|Duchess of Franco]] Grandee of Spain. Her maternal grandparents were Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]], the [[List of Spanish monarchs|Spanish Head of State]] and [[Carmen Polo]] y Mart<U+00ED>nez-Vald<U+00E9>s, 1st Lady of Meir<U+00E1>s Grandee of Spain. Her paternal grandparents were Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Mart<U+00ED>nez y Ortega (1890<U+2013>1970) and Mar<U+00ED>a de la O Bordi<U+00FA> y Bascar<U+00E1>n, 7th Countess of Argillo (1896<U+2013>1980). When Carmen was born in the Palacio del Pardo, the ancient palace of the [[Spanish Royal Family]], she was the first grandchild of General Franco. The palace was their family residence from 1940 when the [[Spanish Civil War]] ended and Gen. Franco became the Spanish Head of State. She was the favorite grandchild, even though she had 6 other siblings: Mar<U+00ED>a de la O (Mariola), Francisco (Francis), Mar<U+00ED>a del Mar (Merry), Jos<U+00E9> Crist<U+00F3>bal (Crist<U+00F3>bal), Mar<U+00ED>a de Ar<U+00E1>nzazu (Arantxa) and Jaime Felipe (Jaime).

==First marriage==
Carmen was married on 8 March 1972 in the Chapel of the Palace of [[El Pardo]] in [[Madrid]] when she was 21 years old with [[Alfonso, Duke of Anjou and C<U+00E1>diz]], son of [[Infante Jaime of Spain, Duke of Segovia]] and grandson of King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]]. General Franco named Alfonso Duke of Cadiz and made him a Royal Highness, making Carmen a princess.

Alfonso and Carmen had two sons:
*Francisco de As<U+00ED>s, Duke of Bourbon (Madrid, 22 November 1972 - Pamplona, 7 February 1984)
*[[Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou|Luis Alfonso, Duke of Anjou]] (born 1974).

Gen. Franco died on 20 November 1975 and the family lost their political power. Alfonso and Carmen separated in 1979, received a civil divorce 1982 and an annulment in 1986. Alfonso was given custody of their sons.

==Second marriage and family tragedies==
After separating from Alfonso, Carmen lived with a [[French people|Frenchman]] of [[Italians|Italian]] descent, Jean-Marie Rossi (b. [[Paris]], 18 November 1930, 20 years her senior), divorced from Barbara Hottinger, by whom he had twin daughters Mathilda and Marella in 1971 and a son Frederick, and in [[Rueil-Malmaison]] on 11 December 1984 she married him civilly. That year was terrible for the pair.  In February, Carmen's son, Francisco de As<U+00ED>s, died in car accident; a little later Rossi's daughter, Mathilda, died in a boating accident. Carmen then had her last child, Mar<U+00ED>a ''Cynthia'' Francisca [[Rossi]], in [[Paris]] on 28 April 1985.

In January 1989, her first husband died in a skiing accident in [[Colorado]] and Carmen became involved in another losing child custody fight over her son, Luis Alfonso, with her former mother-in-law. She and second husband Rossi separated in 1994 and divorced in 1995. She then lived with an [[Italians|Italian]], Robert Federici, but the relationship ended in 2004. Rossi married a third time to Marie Grimaux, without issue.

==Third marriage and first grandchild==
On 18 June 2006 in [[Cazalla de la Sierra]], [[Seville]], she married a third time to a [[Spanish people|Spaniard]], Jos<U+00E9> Campos Garc<U+00ED>a (born in [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]], 13 years her junior). She became a grandmother on 6 March 2007 with the birth of granddaughter Eugenia. In 2006, she was a contestant on  "''Mira qui<U+00E9>n baila!"'' the Spanish version of "[[Strictly Come Dancing]]".

On 28 May 2010, Carmen had twin grandsons, [[Louis, Duke of Burgundy (b. 2010)|Luis]] and Alfonso.
