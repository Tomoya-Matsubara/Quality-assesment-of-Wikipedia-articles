'''''Good Eats''''' is a [[television]] [[cooking show]] created and hosted by [[Alton Brown]] that airs in [[North America]] on [[Food Network]]. Likened to television science educators [[Mr. Wizard]] and [[Bill Nye]], Brown explores the science and technique behind the cooking, the history of different foods, and the advantages of different kinds of cooking equipment. The show tends to focus on familiar dishes that can easily be made at home, and also features segments on choosing the right appliances, and getting the most out of inexpensive, multi-purpose tools. Each episode of ''Good Eats'' has a distinct theme, which is typically an ingredient or a certain cooking technique, but may also be a more generic theme such as [[Thanksgiving]], or "man food." Good Eats received a [[2006]] [[Peabody Award]].
 
==Format==
The show has a distinctive visual style involving [[Dutch angle]]s and shots from cameras placed inside and on various items in the kitchen, including the [[oven]]s, [[refrigerator]], and [[microwave oven]]. In some episodes, Brown and other actors play various characters to tell the story of the food. For example, in the episode "The Big Chili," Brown played a [[cowboy]] trying to rustle up the ideal pot of [[chili con carne|chili]]. In the episode "Give Peas A Chance" (a parody of ''[[The Exorcist]]''), Brown plays a Father Merrin-like character who tries to convince a "possessed" child to eat (and like) peas. In other episodes Brown is simply himself, but is surrounded by fictional characters such as his eggplant and tomato wielding neighbor Mr. McGregor, or a [[city council]]man who refuses to eat fudge. He also uses various makeshift teaching aids to demonstrate scientific concepts.

Episodes of ''Good Eats'' typically begin with an introductory [[monologue]] that always either ends with or leads into the phrase "good eats." The show often closes with the phrase as well. For the first several seasons, Brown himself would say the words "good eats." More recently, however, Brown avoids saying "good eats" at the end of the intro or outro, stopping just short and letting the theme music fill in the phrase.

Episodes usually take place primarily in the (fictional) kitchen of Brown's house.  In Seasons 1<U+2013>4, the episodes were shot in the actual home kitchen of Brown's mother-in-law in the [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] area. In Season 5, taping moved to the new home of the show's Line Producer (Dana Popoff) and Director of Photography (Marion Laney), in which they built a much larger and more versatile kitchen for taping. A 7 ft (2.1 m) section of the island was built for the show and placed on wheels, so it can be moved (or removed) for various shots, and a 12 sq ft (1.1 sq m) grid of pipe was hung from the ceiling, for easier placement of cameras and microphones. The house was featured in a [http://www.homemag.com/article.asp?section_id=25&article_id=50&page_number=1 ''Home Magazine article''] in February 2003. Starting with Season 7, the show moved yet again, this time to an exact replica of the previous kitchen and surrounding areas of the home, built on a sound stage. In the "Behind the Scenes" special, Brown said that complaints by Popoff's neighbors prompted the move.  The stove top and the sink are the only functioning pieces in this kitchen. Many of the other appliances have even had part of their backs removed, so shots of Brown can be taken from inside cabinets, ovens, and refrigerators. This change was generally not known until after Season 7 started airing when the house used in Season 5<U+2013>6 was put on [[eBay]] for sale. It was then revealed that they had moved. It is generally thought that in the "Q" episode on barbecue that was taped in Brown's [[Airstream]] trailer, when Brown says that they are "building the set for Good Eats: The Motion Picture" this is in reality a reference to the new house set. The set was not officially unveiled on the show as a set until the Avocado Experiment show, though the appearance of a trap door in the hardwood floor several episodes previous ("Good Wine Gone Bad") was highly suggestive of a TV set.  

[[Incidental music]] during the show is typically a [[Variation (music)|variation]] of the show's theme, which in turn was based on the theme music from the film ''[[Get Shorty (film)|Get Shorty]]''.{{fact|date=June 2007}} There are dozens of variations of the theme played throughout, crossing all genres of music, including the keypad tones in "Mission:Poachable" and nearly every incidence where a countdown of ten seconds is used. New music is composed for each episode by Patrick Belden of Belden Music and Sound.

Each episode also features text pieces containing [[trivia]] related to the food or cooking technique featured in the episode.  These are always shown just before [[advertising|ad breaks]], and are often shown between major transitions in location or cooking action.  The information presented is usually notes about the history of the food or technique, helpful cooking hints, or technical or scientific information which would be too detailed or dry to include as part of the show's live content.

During the show's first seasons, at the end of each episode Brown would give a summary of the important points covered during the episode; these points would be shown on the screen as he talked.  Brown also traveled to food manufacturing facilities frequently in the first few seasons to talk with experts about the foods being featured.

==Cast and crew==
A staple feature of ''Good Eats'' is the presence of several recurring characters who play important roles on the show, from Brown's relatives and neighbors to various [[Wiktionary:nemesis|nemeses]]. There is an unofficial rule on the ''Good Eats'' set that every crew member must appear in an episode in some fashion, at some point in their time working on the series.  Steve Rooney, who was the show's Executive Chef in the first seasons, has had the most varied characters. 

A few members of Brown's real-life family have appeared on the show. His mother had a walk-on part; his daughter, Zoey, has appeared in several episodes; and his late<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goodeatsfanpage.com/ABFP/ABTimeline/MaMae.htm|title=http://www.goodeatsfanpage.com/ABFP/ABTimeline/MaMae.htm}}</ref> grandmother, "Ma" Mae Skelton, co-hosted the [[biscuit]] episode, "The Dough Also Rises." Even his [[bassett hound]] and [[iguana]] have shown up in a couple of episodes.  However, his wife DeAnna (who is also the [[executive producer]] of ''Good Eats'') has never been documented as having appeared on an episode. 

Specialists who hold real-life positions commonly appear as themselves to provide Brown with useful information on the topic at hand. 

===Recurring characters===
====Fictional====
{| class="wikitable" style="width:100%;"
|-
! width="15%"|'''Character''' !! width="10%"| '''Played by:''' !! width="65%"| '''Role on the show'''
|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''"W" (Vicki Wong)'''|| Vickie Eng || A parody of  [[James Bond]] stories' [[Q (James Bond character)|Q]], "W" is a manager at [[Bed Bath and Beyond]] (or any other store where Brown goes to find kitchen gear). "W" is antisocial, curt, and has a very sardonic sense of humor, and finds Brown particularly annoying. Brown realizes this, and intentionally fools with gadgets and acts silly to get a rise out of her. He also likes to sabotage her attempts to make sales.  Even so, she is the most reliable source of equipment for Brown, as she knows everything about kitchen tools and [[appliances]]. Her appearances are accompanied by a theme that sounds similar to those heard in the James Bond movies. "W"'s full name is revealed in the episode "Salad Daze II: The Long Arm Of the Slaw." In later episodes, "W" began working in the "Good Eats Testing Lab". In real life, Vickie Eng is Brown's [[Chiropractic|chiropractor]]. 
|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''Marsha Brown-Brady'''|| Merrilyn Crouch ||Brown's older sister. Marsha is a constant source of annoyance to Brown (and, as revealed in some episodes, to members of the ''Good Eats'' production staff also).  She often tricks Brown into cooking for her, which usually initiates the topic of that episode. For instance, in "Circle of Life," Marsha manages to talk Brown into making dozens of doughnuts for her bunny scout troop's [[bake sale]], and then tricks him into buying them all back. She has been divorced more than once, as Brown referred to her ink not having dried on her LAST divorce "yet" in "Behind the Bird." 
|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''Elton Brown'''|| John Herina || Marsha's son, hence Brown's nephew. Elton is often featured as Brown's assistant, learning the ways of cooking in the process. Brown treats Elton almost like his own son, despite his and Marsha's constant feuding. Herina, who looks strikingly similar to Brown, also plays a young Brown when necessary, as in the introduction to the roulade-centered episode "Fit to be Tied", and also appeared in the 1996 movie ''[[Nightjohn]]'' as the character Homer Waller.
|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''B.A. Brown'''<br> AKA "Anti-Alton"|| Alton Brown || Brown's [[evil twin]] of sorts. Brown uses camera tricks to appear as himself on one side of the screen and as his "brother" on the other. B.A. Brown is often used in a manner similar to [[Goofus and Gallant]] to compare Brown's cooking techniques to B.A.'s techniques, which often fail or are inferior to Brown's. In "American Pickle," for example, B.A. compares Brown's sweet pickled fruit to a recipe for extremely hot "Firecracker" carrots. B.A. could either stand for "Bad Alton" or be Brown's initials, reversed, or it could be a reference to [[Mr. T]]'s character on the television series ''[[A-Team]]'' who also had a "Bad Attitude." 
|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''Colonel Bob Boatwright'''|| Alton Brown || A white-clad Southern gentleman based on Colonel [[Harlan Sanders]], Colonel Boatwright demonstrates traditional Southern recipes such as [[mint julep]] and [[upside-down cake]].
|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''Cousin Ray''' || Steve Rooney || Brown's cousin, who seems to be a bit of a [[redneck]]. Ray also appears to be either a con man or simply uneducated when it comes to food. In "Crustacean Nation," Ray claims that the shrimp he is selling are turning pink because they are happy to see Brown when actually, as Brown explains, they are cooking in their shells due to the heat. Steve Rooney also plays Brown's "Aunt Verna" who is seen at Brown's [[Thanksgiving]] dinner.
|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''The Mad French Chef''' || Steve Rooney || Brown's arch-nemesis, who is stereotypically snobbish toward all forms of cooking not following the [[French cuisine|French]] ways, and often berates Brown for not using French techniques.  Over the course of the series, the Chef seems to become more angry, as his title in different episodes changes to "Really Mad French Chef" and beyond.  The Chef is currently voiced by Brown, as he is no longer seen on-screen except for one "appearance" as an oven mitt/puppet in the episode "Crepe Expectations."
|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''Thing''' || unknown || Named after Thing from ''[[The Addams Family]]'', Thing is a hand that appears in random locations to hand Brown ingredients and tools. Brown then replies, "Thank you, Thing."  In "Behind the Eats," it was "revealed" that Brown's Thing is the son of the ''Addams Family'' Thing.
|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''Paul'''|| Paul Merchant || Paul is Brown's [[apprentice]] and [[intern]]. Paul is generally incompetent and quite often seems to [[stress out]] regarding food-related issues. Brown calls on him frequently for assistance, often because he is the only one available.  
|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''[[Lactose]] Man''' || Paul Merchant || While appearing to be a superhero, he is in fact a nemesis to Brown, who is [[lactose intolerant]]. Lactose Man usually appears in [[dairy]] product-based episodes. A variation of the Lactose Man character, Lever Man (albeit in the same costume) appeared in the episode "Shell Game," which is dedicated to [[oyster]]s. Brown may or may not know the true identity of Lactose Man, as he identified Lever Man as being his apprentice, Paul. 
|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''Chuck'''|| Daniel Pettrow || Chuck is Brown's "Butcher Neighbor." He has appeared in several episodes, including the episode "A Chuck for Chuck" where Brown spends the entire episode making a [[pot roast]] for Chuck, whose mother has left town on pot roast night. Chuck also appears in the episode "Romancing the Bird: A Good Eats Thanksgiving," where he drives a "Turkey Truck" and explains the difference between fresh, frozen, and refrigerated turkeys. In "Chops Ahoy", Chuck abducted Brown's charcoal grill 'Fireball' in order to convince Brown to buy a new propane grill.
|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''Frances Andersen'''|| Widdi Turner || Frances (a parody of [[Annie Wilkes]] from ''[[Misery (novel)|Misery]]'') is Brown's self-proclaimed biggest fan. She has a collection of many of the show's [[Theatrical property|props]] that she purchased from the internet.  Brown first encountered Frances in "This Spud's For You Too" after his truck broke down, and she held Brown hostage in "Ill Gotten Grains" after he lost his memory in a fender-bender. 
|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''Farmer McGregor'''|| unknown || An elderly man who has a farm near Brown's home, he prides himself on his home-grown [[produce]] and enters them regularly in county fair food contests. Brown used to pilfer from McGregor's prized [[tomato]] patch, but soon stopped when McGregor realized the tomato dishes Brown gave him were made with his own tomatoes. McGregor also has the skills to produce larger-than-average produce, making a potato that weighed 29 lb (13 kg), although it lost in the "Big Food" contest to Brown's modest [[olive]]. McGregor also appears in the [[eggplant]] episode and brings Brown too many eggplants to use, often using [[wheelbarrow]]s and cardboard boxes as delivery methods. He is an obvious reference to farmer McGregor of ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]''.
|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''Koko Karl''' || Bart Hansard || Another of Brown's nemeses, Karl is the symbol of conglomerate [[chocolate]] manufacturers like [[Hershey]]. He is often seen peddling his products to people on the streets and does his best to force them down people's throats. Brown eventually walks by and becomes fed up with Carl's inferior products and then sets out to produce homemade versions of his own. Usually by the end of the episode, Carl ends up in jail for his "crimes," which Brown reads from a newspaper or sees on television. In "Power Trip," Brown visits Koko Karl in a [[solitary confinement]] cell in a scene that mirrors ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''.  In "Puddin' Head Blues," Karl is disguised as "Auntie Puddin'."
|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''Sid Maxburg'''|| Bart Hansard || Sid is a bombastic entertainment agent who is usually seen trying to revamp allegedly forgotten foods like vanilla ("My Pod"), sweet potatoes ("Potato, My Sweet"), and okra ("Okraphobia").
|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''"Government Agents"'''|| Brown, others || Stereotypical "[[Men in Black]]", mostly from the [[FDA]] or [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], who usually give information about government standards for certain foods, speaking in a stereotypical overly-serious tone.  At times, they also claim that Brown's food does not meet government regulations, and as a consequence confiscate what he's cooked. Sometimes, Brown's aforementioned evil twin acts as a single "agent"{{Fact|date=February 2007}}; at other times, they show up as a group of three "agents," two men and one woman, and are generally played by members of the production crew. Brown always appears as one of the "Feds." In "School of Hard Nogs" they called themselves the "Food Police." In one episode ("Churn Baby Churn 2"), [[Nic Sims]] of [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], a fan who got her kitchen made over by AB in a [[Food Network]] special, played one of the "Agents," dressed as [[soda jerk]]s.
|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''The Dungeon Master'''|| Lucky Yates || Brown's personal dungeon master (a parody of [[Igor (fictional character)|Igor]]), who appears in "Cubing A Round" and "Tort(illa) Reform." Brown usually disapproves of his loose grip on reality; for example, in "Cubing A Round" he spends $1,500 on a Swiss mechanical steak cuber using "the little plastic thing with the numbers on it" (a [[credit card]]).  (Lucky Yates has appeared in numerous "Good Eats" episodes.)

|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''[[Shirley Corriher]]'''|| Author, chef, self-labeled "[[mad scientist|mad]]" food scientist || Shirley appears on the show to help explain the scientific processes behind cooking. She is the author of ''CookWise, the Hows and Whys of Successful Cooking'', which won the 1998 [[James Beard Foundation|James Beard Award]] for Food Reference and Technique. Whereas Brown tends to use comedy around the other experts, particularly Deborah Duchon, he generally plays straight with Corriher.
|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''Deborah Duchon'''|| Nutritional [[anthropologist]] || Duchon is from the Department of Anthropology and Geography at [[Georgia State University]], and often appears on the show when Brown is exploring the [[history]] of a topic. She tends to appear out of nowhere, leading Brown to almost predict her presence as soon as he mentions "nutritional anthropologist." She is probably the most featured expert on ''Good Eats'', appearing in many episodes since part of the show is normally dedicated to exploring the history of a food. Generally, Brown ends his scenes with Duchon by asking her, "how do you like your ''(food of the day)''?" One fourth season episode ("Chile's Angels") featured a character called "Debbie Duchon" who was supposed to be Duchon's daughter. She was, in fact, a fictional creation of Brown's when Duchon was not available for filming, leading to a bemused reaction from Duchon when fans of the show asked her about her "daughter."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goodeatsfanpage.com/References/TheInterviews/DebDuchon1.htm|title=http://www.goodeatsfanpage.com/References/TheInterviews/DebDuchon1.htm}}</ref>
|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''Caroline Connell'''||  [[Nutritionist]], [[dietitian]] || Connell (and other similar experts) tend to appear on episodes where Brown features a food that has positive health effects, and uses nutritionist's data as evidence. She appears many times in the first seasons, but now it seems that Brown retrieves his information from many specialists that only come on the show once or twice.
|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''Carolyn O'Neil''' <br> ''The Lady of the Refrigerator''  || [[Dietitian]] || O'Neil is a dietitian who occasionally shows up to discuss nutritional value of foods with Brown.  She also plays The Lady of the Refrigerator (a parody of [[The Lady of the Lake]]), who occasionally appears in Brown's refrigerator to impart information about the food or cooking technique covered in the episode, and to tease and needle Brown.
|-
| nowrap="nowrap" |'''"Ma" Mae Skelton'''|| Brown's grandmother || In addition to being referenced by Brown in several episodes, she appeared in "The Dough Also Rises," and baked biscuits alongside Brown.  She passed away in 2001.
|}

Brown also plays other roles from time to time, which usually consist of him explaining something close to the camera while another Brown performs the information that is being presented behind him (similar to the technique used to present B.A. Brown). At the same time, he also acts out alone or with others on camera while providing a narrative quite often (to re-enact such topics as cavemen discovering cooking techniques). There are also scenes where Brown talks to a character played by himself, cutting away to the other after each one has said their line. This is mostly used when the "USDA agents" appear to give grades and regulations placed on meats and dairy products.

==History==
The [[television pilot|pilot]] for ''Good Eats'' first aired on the [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]] [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] affiliate [[WTTW-TV|WTTW]] in July [[1998]].

==Awards==
Good Eats earned a [[Peabody Award]] in 2006. "Rarely has science been taught on TV in such an entertaining <U+2013> and appetizing <U+2013> manner as it is in Alton Brown's goofy, tirelessly inventive series."<ref>http://www.peabody.uga.edu/news/pressrelease.asp?ID=142=List of 2006 Peabody Award Winners</ref>

{{main|List of Good Eats episodes}}

==Trivia==
*Rather than use [[cue cards]] or a [[teleprompter]], Brown prerecords his monologue and then uses tiny [[earpiece]]s to listen to it as he is on camera. <ref name="Parker">Parker, Virginia. ''Atlanta'' Magazine. Alton Brown Steaks His Claim. April 2007.</ref>  This allows him to keep the complicated facts and statistics in his script straight, and partially accounts for his halting speaking style on the show.
*In the episode "Churn Baby Churn 2", the role of one of the USDA agents was awarded to the winner of Food Network's "[[All Star Kitchen Makeover]]" in addition to a kitchen designed by Alton Brown.
*The clock seen in ''Good Eats'' is often set by the crew to a significant date such as a crew member's birthday, anniversary, etc.
*In Season 9, the episode "Behind the Eats" was produced, which offered a backstage look at the show's production.
*Whenever Brown mentions [[stuffing]], someone holds up a sign that says "STUFFING IS EVIL." This is in reference to the Thanksgiving special, wherein Brown denigrated stuffing as increasing cooking time, being a harbinger of [[food poisoning]], and not being good eats. However, he does make exceptions for when stuffing would be appropriate (particularly for stuffed pork), and he later recanted in Season 8 and agreed that stuffing, when done properly, is good eats (dedicating a whole show to the subject).
*In episodes with [[Bigfoot]], the sounds Bigfoot makes are the same noises demons make when dying in the computer game ''[[Doom]]''.
*According to urban legend, an episode devoted entirely to eating [[Cap'n Crunch]] was filmed as part of an [[April Fools' Day]] joke but never aired.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
*The access codes for the Good Eats [[laboratory]] are:
:*0851390555 in ''Mission: Poachable'' (EA1C13 - Season 3 Episode 11) 
:*180*745666 in ''Chile's Angles'' (EA1D01 - Season 4 Episode 13)
*Most Food Network shows do not display name brand names of products used during cooking, and care is taken to create false labels for products in these shows. However, in early seasons of ''Good Eats'', Brown occasionally displayed brand name products on the show (e.g., a bottle of Karo [[corn syrup]] during the episode on cooking with sugar). Currently, brand name product labels are altered, although the alterations generally consist of false names added to labels rather than entirely new labels. (i.e. "Kerry" brand Worcestershire sauce) Also, when using crushed crackers in a recipe, Brown will usually say, "What kind? Well, I'm not going to tell you, but they look like this," and then hold up a [[Ritz cracker]]. However, on occasional shots taken from inside the freezer, frozen [[Publix]] brand vegetables can be seen. [[Kroger]] stores and products can also be spotted.
*In the episode "Pop Art", the marquee at the Majestic Movie theater advertises "Feasting on Asphalt IV", one of Alton Brown's other series.
*Although it is his most prominent production, Brown says he makes no money from the broadcast of ''Good Eats''.  He spends the entire budget allocated by [[Food Network]] on producing the show and receives no [[residual (entertainment industry)|residual]]s.  Instead, all of his personal income comes from DVD sales, book royalties, speaking engagements, and corporate consulting. <ref name="Parker"/>
*Brown's real life home kitchen has only been on the show once.
