'''Kirklee railway station''' was a [[railway station]] serving the [[Kelvinside]] area in the West End of [[Glasgow]]. 

==History==
The station was opened on [[10 August]] [[1896]] by the [[Glasgow Central Railway]].<ref name="butt136">Butt, page 136</ref> Also known as '''Kirklee for North Kelvinside''', it was closed between [[1 January]] [[1917]] and [[2 March]] [[1919]] due to [[First World War|wartime economy]],<ref name="butt136"/> and closed permanently to passengers on [[1 May]] [[1939]],<ref name="butt136"/> with the line being closed on [[5 October]] [[1964]].

The station building was designed by famous architect [[Sir J.J. Burnet]] who earned his knighthood on the basis of his design for the extension of the [[British Museum]].<ref>Urquhart, Chapter on West End Railways</ref> The construction of the station was controversial in the 1890s as it destroyed a local beauty spot known as the <i>Peatree Well</i>.<ref>Morton,</ref>. Little is known of the station's use after closure but a photo taken in 1959 appears to show it in use a private house.<ref>Anderson and Smith,</ref> The station buildings were demolished in 1971 having fallen into disrepair.

The bulk of the station site is now occupied by blocks of apartments, however the platforms partially remain in place to the south, beyond the supports for a bridge which has since been removed, and just before a long tunnel leading to [[Botanic Gardens railway station]]. A telegraph pole dating from the line's operation is still present just before the mouth of the tunnel.
