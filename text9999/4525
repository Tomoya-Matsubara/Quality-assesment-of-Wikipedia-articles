'''Homer Jay Simpson''' is a fictional main character in the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and father of the [[Simpson family|eponymous family]]. He is voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]] and first appeared on television in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] "[[Good Night (The Simpsons short)|Good Night]]" on April 19, 1987. Homer was created and designed by cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] while he was waiting in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on ''[[Life in Hell]]'' but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his father Homer Groening. After appearing on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' for three years, the Simpson family got their own series on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which debuted December 17, 1989.

Homer is the boorish father of the Simpson family. With his wife, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], he has three children: [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. As the family's provider, he works at the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]]. Homer embodies several American [[working class]] stereotypes: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, clumsy, and lazy; however, he is also fiercely devoted to his family. Despite the suburban [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences.

In the shorts and earlier episodes, Castellaneta voiced Homer with a loose impression of [[Walter Matthau]]; however, during the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, Homer's voice evolved to become more robust, to allow the expression of a fuller range of emotions. He has appeared in other media relating to ''The Simpsons''&nbsp;<U+2013> including video games, ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', [[The Simpsons Ride]], commercials and comic books&nbsp;<U+2013> and inspired an entire line of merchandise. His catchphrase, the annoyed grunt "[[d'oh!]]", has been included in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English|The New Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' since 1998 and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' since 2001.

Homer is one of the most influential fictional characters on television, having been described by the British newspaper ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' as "the greatest comic creation of [modern] time". He was ranked the second greatest cartoon character by ''[[TV Guide]]'' and was voted the greatest television character of all-time by [[Channel 4]] viewers. Castellaneta has earned three [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] and a special achievement [[Annie Award]] for voicing Homer. In 2000, Homer, along with the rest of his family, was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
''The Simpsons'' uses a [[floating timeline]] in which the characters [[Ageless|do not physically age]], and as such the show is generally assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific time periods, although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes.<ref name=p78/> Homer Simpson is the bumbling husband of Marge and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.<ref name=p78/> He was raised by his parents, [[Mona Simpson (The Simpsons)|Mona]] and [[Abraham Simpson]]; in the episode "[[Mother Simpson]]", ([[The Simpsons (season 7)|season seven]], 1995) it is revealed that Mona went into hiding in the mid-1960s following a run-in with the law.<ref name=MotherSimpson>{{cite episode |title=Mother Simpson|episodelink=Mother Simpson |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=[[Rich Appel|Appel, Rich]]; [[David Silverman|Silverman, David]]|network=Fox |airdate=1995-11-19 |season=07 |number=08}}</ref> Homer attended Springfield High School, and in his final year fell in love with [[Marge Simpson|Marge Bouvier]].<ref name=WayWeWas>{{cite episode |title=The Way We Was|episodelink=The Way We Was |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=[[Al Jean|Jean, Al]]; [[Mike Reiss|Reiss, Mike]]; [[Sam Simon|Simon, Sam]]; Silverman, David|network=Fox |airdate=1991-01-31 |season=02 |number=12}}</ref> Marge later discovered she was pregnant with Bart, and the two were married in a small wedding chapel across the state line.

The episode "[[That 90's Show]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 19)|season 19]], 2007) contradicted much of the established backstory; for example, it was revealed that Homer and Marge were childless in the early 1990s although past episodes had suggested Bart and Lisa were born in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite episode |title=That 90's Show|episodelink=That 90's Show|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=[[Matt Selman|Selman, Matt]]; [[Mark Kirkland|Kirkland, Mark]]|network=Fox |airdate=2008-01-27 |season=19|number=11}}</ref>

==Character==
===Creation===
[[Image:Groening at comiccon.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Matt Groening created Homer while waiting in James L. Brooks' office]]
[[Matt Groening]] first conceived Homer and the rest of the Simpson family in 1986 in the lobby of producer [[James L. Brooks]]' office. Groening had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts for ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', and had intended to present an adaptation of his ''[[Life in Hell]]'' comic strip. When he realized that animating ''Life in Hell'' would require him to rescind publication rights, Groening decided to go in another direction,<ref name="americasfirstfamily">{{cite video|people=BBC|year=2000|title='The Simpsons': America's First Family (6 minute edit for the season 1 DVD)|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250735/|format=DVD|location=UK|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family, naming the characters after members of his own family.

Homer made his debut with the rest of the Simpson family on April 19, 1987 in ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] "[[Good Night (The Simpsons short)|Good Night]]".<ref>[[#Richmond|Richmond]], p. 14</ref> In 1989, the shorts were adapted into ''The Simpsons'', a half-hour series airing on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]].

The entire Simpson family was designed so that they would be recognizable in silhouette.<ref>Groening, Matt; Al Jean, Mike Reiss. (2001). Commentary for "[[There's No Disgrace Like Home]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings.<ref name="americasfirstfamily"/> Homer's physical features are generally not used in other characters; for example, in the later seasons, no characters other than Homer and [[Lenny Leonard|Lenny]] have a similar beard line.<ref>Groening, Matt; Reiss, Mike; Kirkland, Mark. (2002). Commentary for "[[Principal Charming]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> When Groening originally designed Homer, he put his initials into the character's hairline and ear: the hairline resembled an 'M', and the right ear resembled a 'G'. Groening decided that this would be too distracting though, and redesigned the ear to look normal. He still draws the ear as a 'G' when he draws pictures of Homer for fans.<ref>{{cite book | author = [[Matt Groening]] | title = Simpsons Comics Royale | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2001 | pages = 90 | isbn = 0-00-711854-6}}</ref> The basic shape of Homer's head is described by director [[Mark Kirkland]] as a tube-shaped coffee can with a salad bowl on top.

Illustrated commentary for "[[Treehouse of Horror IV]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> In some early episodes, Homer's hair was rounded rather than sharply pointed because animation director [[Wes Archer]] felt it should look disheveled.

In the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|season seven]] (1995) episode "[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]", Homer was computer animated into a [[3D computer graphics|three dimensional]] character for the first time for the "Homer<sup>3</sup>" segment of the episode. The computer animation directors at [[Pacific Data Images]] worked hard not to "reinvent the character".<ref name=3D/> In the final minute of the segment, the 3D Homer ends up in a real world, live-action [[Los Angeles]].

Homer's voice is performed by [[Dan Castellaneta]], who voices numerous other characters, including Abraham Simpson, [[Krusty the Clown]], [[Barney Gumble]], [[Groundskeeper Willie]], [[Mayor Quimby]] and [[Hans Moleman]]. Castellaneta had been part of the regular cast of ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' and had previously done some voice-over work in [[Chicago]] alongside his wife [[Deb Lacusta]].

"[[Homer's Barbershop Quartet]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 5)|season five]], 1993) is the only episode where Homer's voice was provided by someone other than Castellaneta.

===Personality===
Homer's personality and comic efficacy lies in his frequent bouts of stupidity, laziness and explosive anger. He has a low intelligence level, described by director [[David Silverman]] as "creatively brilliant in his stupidity".<ref name=sundvd/> Homer also shows immense apathy towards work, is overweight, and "is devoted to his stomach".<ref name=sundvd/> His short attention span is evidenced by his impulsive decisions to engage in various hobbies and enterprises, only to "change ... his mind when things go badly".<ref name=sundvd>{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt; [[Mike Scully|Scully, Mike]]; Jean, Al; Brooks, James L.; Silverman, David|year=2007|title=The Simpsons Movie: A Look Behind the Scenes| medium=DVD||publisher=distributed by ''[[The Sun]]''}}</ref> Homer often spends his evenings drinking [[Duff Beer]] at [[Moe's Tavern]] and, as shown in the episode "[[Duffless]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 4)|season four]], 1993), is a borderline [[alcoholic]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=Duffless|episodelink=Duffless|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=[[David M. Stern|Stern, David M.]]; [[Jim Reardon|Reardon, Jim]]|network=Fox |airdate=1993-02-18 |season=04|number=16}}</ref> He is very envious of his neighbors, the [[Flanders family]], and is easily enraged by [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]: Homer will often strangle Bart on impulse in a cartoonish manner. The first instance of Homer strangling Bart was in the short "Family Portrait". Matt Groening's rule was that Homer could only strangle Bart impulsively, never with pre-meditation, and that it would always be over quickly.<ref>Groening, Matt. (2002). Commentary for "[[Simpson and Delilah]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Another of the original ideas entertained by Groening was that Homer would "always get his comeuppance or Bart had to strangle him back", but this was dropped.<ref>Groening, Matt. (2001). Commentary for "[[Bart the Genius]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> He shows no compunction about expressing his rage, and does not attempt to hide his actions from people outside the family.<ref name=sundvd/> While Homer has repeatedly upset people and caused all sorts of mayhem in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], these events are usually the result of either his intense temper or a lack of foresight rather than any malice. Except for expressing annoyance at [[Ned Flanders]], Homer's destructive actions are usually unintentional.

Homer has complex relationships with all three of his children. He often berates Bart, but the two commonly share adventures and are sometimes allies. Homer and Lisa have opposite personalities and he usually overlooks Lisa's talents, but when made aware of his neglect does everything he can to help her. He sometimes forgets that Maggie even exists, although Homer has often tried to bond with her; "daddy" was her first word. While Homer's thoughtless antics often upset his family, he has also revealed himself to be a surprisingly caring father and husband: in "[[Lisa the Beauty Queen]]", ([[The Simpsons (season 4)|season four]], 1992) he sold his cherished ride on the Duff blimp and used the money to enter Lisa in a beauty pageant so she could feel better about herself;<ref name="Beauty"/> in "[[Rosebud (The Simpsons)|Rosebud]]", ([[The Simpsons (season 5)|season five]], 1993) he gave up his chance at wealth to allow Maggie to keep a cherished teddy bear;<ref>{{cite episode |title=Rosebud|episodelink=Rosebud (The Simpsons)|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=[[John Swartzwelder|Swartzwelder, John]]; [[Wes Archer|Archer, Wes]]|network=Fox |airdate=1993-10-21 |season=05|number=04}}</ref> in "[[Radio Bart]]", ([[The Simpsons (season 3)|season three]], 1992) he spearheaded an attempt to dig Bart out after he had fallen down a well;<ref>{{cite episode |title=Radio Bart|episodelink=Radio Bart|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=[[Jon Vitti|Vitti, Jon]]; [[Carlos Baeza|Baeza, Carlos]]|network=Fox |airdate=1992-01-09|season=03|number=13}}</ref> and in "[[A Milhouse Divided]]", ([[The Simpsons (season 8)|season eight]], 1996) he arranged a surprise second wedding with Marge to make up for their unsatisfactory first ceremony.<ref>{{cite episode |title=A Milhouse Divided|episodelink=A Milhouse Divided|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=[[Steve Tompkins|Tompkins, Steve]]; [[Steven Dean Moore|Moore, Steven Dean]]|network=Fox |airdate=1996-12-01 |season=08|number=06}}</ref> Homer however has a poor relationship with his father [[Abraham Simpson|Abraham "Grampa" Simpson]], whom he placed in a [[nursing home]] as soon as he could.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lisa's First Word|episodelink=Lisa's First Word|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff; Kirkland, Mark|network=Fox |airdate=1992-12-03 |season=04|number=10}}</ref> The Simpson family will often do their best to avoid unnecessary contact with Grampa, but Homer has shown feelings of love for his father from time to time.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Old Money|episodelink=Old Money (The Simpsons)|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=[[Jay Kogen|Kogen, Jay]]; [[Wallace Wolodarsky|Wolodarsky, Wallace]]; Silverman, David|network=Fox |airdate=1991-03-28 |season=02|number=17}}</ref>

===D'oh!===
{{Main|D'oh!}}
Homer's catchphrase is the annoyed grunt "d'oh" that is typically uttered when he injures himself, realizes that he has done something stupid, or when something bad has happened or is about to happen to him. During the voice recording session for a ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show|Tracey Ullman Show]]'' short, Homer was required to utter what was written in the script as an "annoyed grunt". Dan Castellaneta rendered it as a drawn out "d'ooooooh". This was inspired by [[Jimmy Finlayson]], the mustachioed Scottish actor who appeared in 33 [[Laurel and Hardy]] films. Finlayson had used the term as a [[minced oath]] to stand in for the word "[[damnation|Damn]]!" [[Matt Groening]] felt that it would better suit the timing of animation if it were spoken faster. Castellaneta then shortened it to a quickly uttered "d'oh!"<ref name=herald>{{Cite news| title =What<U+2019>s the story with . . .
