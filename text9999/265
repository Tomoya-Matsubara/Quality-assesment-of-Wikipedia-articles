The '''Hawker Sea Hawk''' was a British single-seat jet fighter of the [[Fleet Air Arm]] (FAA), the air branch of the [[Royal Navy]] (RN), built by [[Hawker Aircraft]] and its sister company, [[Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft]]. Although its origins stemmed from earlier Hawker piston-engined fighters, the Sea Hawk became the company's first jet aircraft. After successful acceptance in the RN, the type proved to be a reliable and sturdy workhorse and went on to export success abroad.

==Design and development==
In the final years of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Hawker's design team explored jet engine technology, initially looking at "stretching" and modifying the existing [[Hawker Sea Fury|Hawker Fury/Sea Fury]] [[planform]] fitting a mid-engine [[Rolls-Royce Nene]] jet engine and moving the cockpit to the extreme front of the fuselage, creating the '''P.1035'''. With encouragement from the [[Air Ministry]], the design was altered substantially, with the wing losing the elliptical shape of the Fury and featuring wing-root air intakes and short [[wikt:bifurcation|bifurcated]] jet exhausts (which gained the name "trouser legs"). This redesign culminated in building the private venture '''P.1040'''.<ref name="Badrocke p. 60" /> The  unusual bifurcated jet pipe reduced jet pipe power loss and freed up space in the rear fuselage for fuel tanks, allowing the aircraft to have a longer range than many other early jets.<ref name="Badrocke p. 60" >Badrocke 2002. p. 60.</ref> The aircraft's fuselage fuel tanks were fore and aft of the engine giving a stable centre of gravity in flight. Initially, the P.1040 was intended for the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) as an interceptor, even though a top speed of only 600 mph was forecast. When in 1945 the RAF showed little interest in the project<ref >Mason 1991, p. 316.</ref> because it offered insufficient advance over jet fighters already in service such as the [[Gloster Meteor]] and [[de Havilland Vampire]], the P.1040 was offered to the [[Admiralty]] as a fleet support fighter, the '''P.1046'''.<ref name="James p. 48" />

<!--  Commented out: [[Image:Hawker P1040 - VP401 - Sea Hawk Prototype.jpg|thumb|left|The Hawker P.1040 prototype ''VP401'']] -->
The P.1040 prototype ([[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|''VP401'']]), sometimes called the '''Hawker N.7/46''' after the [[List of Air Ministry specifications|naval specification]] flew on 2 September 1947, piloted by [[Bill Humble]].<ref name="James p. 48" >James 2002, p. 48.</ref>Teething problems including airframe vibrations and tail buffeting led to a redesign of the rear jetpipe fairings and the addition of a bullet fairing on the tail. Other minor issues including high stick forces and windshield distortion were addressed while a long takeoff run was attributed to the low powered Nene 1 that had been not rated for its full power settings.<ref >James 2002, pp. 48, 50.</ref>

A fully navalised prototype, ''VP413'' equipped with folding wings, catapult spools and full armament did not fly until 31 August 1948. A third prototype which flew in 1949 incorporated a number of modifications from the second prototype, including the fitting of a longer arrester hook when a number of "[[Bolter (aviation)|bolters]]" were experienced in the dummy deck trials. After the longer hook was incorporated, the modification was carried though the remaining production runs.<ref>James 2002, p. 50.</ref> The first carrier trials occurred aboard the fleet aircraft carrier {{HMS|Illustrious|R87|6}} that same year. ''VP401'', the first prototype continued in the flight test programme and before being retired, was involved in two significant events. On 1 August 1949, the Royal Navy entered ''VP401'' in the National Air Races, winning the [[Society of British Aircraft Constructors|SBAC]] Challenge Cup Race, beating a Vampire 3 and [[de Havilland DH.108|DH 108]]. The prototype was later converted into the '''[[Hawker P.1072]]''' with the addition of an auxiliary rocket engine, becoming the first British rocket-powered aircraft. After a few flights were made in 1950, the rocket engine blew up during a test and although repaired, the airframe was scrapped.<ref name="James p. 55">James 2002, p. 55.</ref>

The third prototype joined a specially-prepared Vampire Mk 21 in testing the feasibility of operating without an undercarriage utilizing a [[Rubber deck|flexible deck]]. Flying from [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]], ''VP413'' successfully completed both catapult launches and "rubber sheet" deck landings, with the undercarriage remaining retracted throughout the flights. Although the system was proved, the project was abandoned in 1950 when more powerful engines precluded the need to radically adapt the design to the concept of combat aircraft without undercarriages.<ref name="James p. 55"/>

Over 100 of the aircraft, named '''Sea Hawk,''' were subsequently ordered by the Royal Navy. The first production Sea Hawk F1 was ''WF143'', which flew on 14 November 1951 with 39&nbsp;ft (12&nbsp;m) wingspan and a tailplane of increased area.

Unlike its rival, the [[Supermarine Attacker]] (the first jet to enter service with the FAA), the Sea Hawk had a [[tricycle undercarriage]] rather than a tail-wheel, making it easier to land on carriers. It was a fairly conventional design however, while other contemporary aircraft, e.g. the [[F-86 Sabre]], had adopted swept wings, the Sea Hawk had straight wings. Swept wing versions '''([[Hawker P.1052|P.1052]]''' and '''[[Hawker P.1081|P.1081]]''') were built and experience gained with the latter was instrumental in developing the [[Hawker Hunter]] design. The Sea Hawk was still a reliable and elegant aeroplane though its cautious design meant it would only have a brief career before being superseded by more advanced aircraft.

==Operational history==
<!--  Commented out: [[Image:Hawker Sea Hawk - VP422.jpg|thumb|right|The Hawker Sea Hawk ''VP422'']] -->
[[Image:Armstrong Whitworth Sea Hawk FGA.6 WV797 9m07.JPG|thumb|right|Armstrong Whitworth Sea Hawk FGA.6 (serial number WV797) at the [[Midland Air Museum]], England]]
[[Image:sea hawk wv908 frontview arp.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal Navy]] Historic Flight Sea Hawk FGA 6 on static display at [[Kemble Airport|Kemble Air Day]] 2008, UK.]] 

The first production Sea Hawk was the '''F 1''', which first flew in 1951, entered service two years later with 806 Squadron, first based at Brawdy, then transferred to the {{HMS|Eagle|R05|6}}. Just over 30 were actually built by Hawker. At that time, Hawker was also producing the [[Hawker Hunter]] for the RAF and so production and further development of the Sea Hawk was switched to [[Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft]], part of the Hawker group.<ref>Brown 1982, p. 287.</ref> The F 1 was armed with four 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|Hispano Mk V]] cannons. It was powered by a single 5,000&nbsp;lbf (22&nbsp;kN) thrust [[Rolls-Royce Nene]] 101 turbojet. The F 1 had a maximum speed of 599&nbsp;mph (964&nbsp;km/h) at sea level and a range of 800&nbsp;mi (1,287&nbsp;km) on internal fuel. The second fighter variant was the '''F 2''' which introduced power-boosted aileron controls as well as other modifications, including to its structure. <ref>Brown 1982, p. 289.</ref>

The next variant of the Sea Hawk was developed into a fighter-bomber, the '''FB 3''' - Fighter-Bomber Mark 3 -(over 100 built) and differed only slightly from its predecessors. Its structure was strengthened to allow it to carry a wide array of equipment and weaponry. Its new armament consisted of two 500&nbsp;lb (227&nbsp;kg) bombs and 16 unguided rockets. The fourth Sea Hawk was a fighter ground-attack variant, the '''FGA 4''', with increased weapons capability. The fifth Sea Hawk was a fighter-bomber variant, the '''FB 5''', basically FB 3 and FGA 4s re-engined with the new Rolls-Royce Nene 103. The final Sea Hawk was a fighter ground-attack variant, '''FGA 6''', and was exactly the same as its immediate predecessor, though they were new builds rather than re-engined, with just under 90 built. All Sea Hawks were in service by the mid-1950s and eventually over 500 were built. <ref name="Green p. 49">Green 1982, p. 49.</ref>

Although Australia and Canada both initially expressed interest in the Sea Hawk, to the extent that examples were tested by each country's naval forces, the first export version was the '''Sea Hawk Mk 50''', a ground-attack variant for the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]]; 22 aircraft were in service between 1957 to 1964. <ref name="James p. 66">James 1982, p. 66.</ref>The next export variant was the '''Sea Hawk Mk 100''', a strike fighter variant for the German ''[[Bundesmarine]]'', the Navy of West Germany. The final German export version was the '''Sea Hawk Mk 101''', a night fighter, reconnaissance variant for the ''Bundesmarine''. The Sea Hawk served into the mid-1960s, unil its replacement by the [[F-104 Starfighter]]. <ref name="Green p. 49"/>The last export customer was India who ordered a mix of 24 new-build Sea Hawks and 12 refurbished ex-FAA Mk 6s in 1959, following up with 30 additional  airframes reconstructed from West German stocks, among others. <ref name="James p. 66"/>

===Combat record===
The Sea Hawk, as part of the Fleet Air Arm, saw extensive service during the [[Suez Crisis]], initiated by [[Egypt]]'s nationalisation of the [[Suez Canal]]. The United Kingdom, France and [[Israel]] took part in the campaign, with the Anglo-French invasion being known as [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Operation Musketeer]], beginning on 31 October 1956. Six Sea Hawk squadrons took part: two were aboard the fleet carrier HMS ''Eagle'', and two each aboard the light fleet carriers {{HMS|Albion|R07|6}} and {{HMS|Bulwark|R08|6}}. The Sea Hawks were used for ground-attack, in which they excelled, causing immense damage to a variety of Egyptian targets. The military aspect of the Suez Campaign was a success, unlike the political disaster. All Allied forces were eventually withdrawn by 1957. 

[[File:INS Vikrant circa 1984 carrying a unique complement of Sea Harriers, Sea Hawks, Allouette & Sea King helicopters and Alize ASW.jpg|thumb|left|The Indian aircraft carrier [[INS Vikrant]] in the early 1980s, carrying Sea Hawks, [[Sea Harrier]]s, [[A<U+00E9>rospatiale Alouette III|Allouette]] and [[Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King|Sea King]] helicopters, and [[Breguet Aliz<U+00E9>|Alize]] ASW aircraft]]
The Sea Hawk was a successful export aircraft. In the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]], it served aboard the Dutch aircraft carrier [[HNLMS Karel Doorman (R81)|HNLMS ''Karel Doorman'']], ex-{{HMS|Venerable|R63|6}}, including decolonization operations guarding against Indonesian threats in the area.  From 1959 on they were equipped with [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|Sidewinder missiles]] significantly enhancing and extending their air to air combat capabilities.<ref>Rickard, J (6 June 2010), Hawker Sea Hawk Mark 50 , http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_hawker_sea_hawk_50.html</ref> In 1964, the Sea Hawks that served on her were moved ashore when the NATO mission profile was changed to all ASW aircraft. When ''Karel Doorman'' was sold to [[Argentina]] they were quickly taken out of service.  

In Indian Navy service (beginning in 1960), Sea Hawks were used aboard the aircraft carrier [[INS Vikrant|INS ''Vikrant'']], ex-HMS ''Hercules'' and saw service during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]] and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. The latter war saw Sea Hawks being used by the [[Indian Navy]]; these aircraft scored nearly a dozen "kills", mainly of [[Pakistan Navy]] [[gunboat]]s and [[Merchant navy]] ships and [[cargo ship]]s in [[East Pakistan]] (present day [[Bangladesh]]) without losing an aircraft in the war.  <ref>Harry, B. [http://orbat.com/site/cimh/navy/kills(1971)-2.pdf "Damage Assessment - 1971 Indo-Pak Naval War v.2.0."] ''orbat.com'', 1 February 2005.  Retrieved: 22 July 2009.</ref> Aided by [[Breguet Alize]] aircraft, the Sea Hawks emerged unscathed, achieving the highest [[kill ratio]] for any aircraft in the entire war. The Sea Hawk was withdrawn from Indian Navy service in 1983, being replaced by the far more capable [[BAE Sea Harrier]].

==Retirement==
The Sea Hawks in Fleet Air Arm service began phasing out from first line service in 1958, the year the [[Supermarine Scimitar]] and [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]] entered service, both of which would eventually replace the Sea Hawk. The last first line Sea Hawk squadron disbanded at [[RNAS Brawdy]] in December 1960, ending a very brief career for the Sea Hawk. Most Sea Hawks in second line service were  withdrawn by the mid-1960s. The last operational Royal Navy Sea Hawks were the "black" Fleet Requirements Unit at Hurn that retired the type in 1969. <ref>James 1982, p. 62.</ref>
