This period of Greek literature stretches from Homer until the 4th century BC and the rise of [[Alexander the Great]]. [[Alfred North Whitehead]] once claimed that all of philosophy is but a footnote to [[Plato]]. To suggest that all of [[Western literature]] is no more than a footnote to the writings of ancient Greece is an exaggeration, but it is nevertheless true that the [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] world of thought was so far-ranging that there is scarcely an idea discussed today not already debated by the ancient writers.

The earliest known Greek writings are [[Mycenaean language|Mycenaean]], written in the [[Linear B]] syllabary on clay tablets. These documents contain prosaic records largely concerned with trade (lists, inventories, receipts, etc.); no real literature has been discovered. Several theories have been advanced to explain this curious absence. One is that Mycenaean literature, like the works of Homer and other [[epic poetry|epic poems]], was passed on orally, since the Linear B syllabary is not well-suited to recording the sounds of Greek (see [[phonemic principle]]). Another is that literary works, being the preserve of an elite, were written on finer materials such as [[parchment]], which have not survived. 

=== Epic poetry ===

At the beginning of Greek literature stand the two monumental works of [[Homer]], the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. The figure of Homer is shrouded in mystery. Although the works as they now stand are credited to him, it is certain that their roots reach far back before his time (see [[Homeric Question]]). The ''Iliad'' is the famous story about the Trojan War. It centers on the person of Achilles, who embodied the Greek heroic ideal. 

While the ''Iliad'' is pure [[tragedy]], the ''Odyssey'' is a mixture of [[tragedy]] and [[comedy]]. It is the story of Odysseus, one of the warriors at [[Troy]]. After ten years fighting the war, he spends another ten years sailing back home to his wife and family. During his ten-year voyage, he loses all of his comrades and ships and makes his way home to [[Ithaca]] disguised as a beggar. Both of these works were based on ancient legends. The stories are told in language that is simple, direct, and eloquent. Both are as fascinatingly readable today as they were in [[ancient Greece]]. 

The other great poet of the preclassical period was [[Hesiod]]. Unlike Homer, Hesiod speaks of himself in his poetry; it remains true that nothing is known about him from any external source. He was a native of [[Boeotia]] in [[central Greece]], and is thought to have lived and worked around [[700 BC]]. His two works were ''[[Works and Days]]'' and ''[[Theogony]]''. The first is a faithful depiction of the poverty-stricken country life he knew so well, and it sets forth principles and rules for farmers. ''Theogony'' is a systematic account of creation and of the gods. It vividly describes the ages of mankind, beginning with a long-past [[Golden Age]]. Together the works of Homer and Hesiod made a kind of bible for the [[Greeks]]. Homer told the story of a [[heroic]] past, and Hesiod dealt with the practical realities of daily life.

=== Lyric poetry ===

The type of poetry called lyric got its name from the fact that it was originally sung by individuals or a chorus accompanied by the instrument called the [[lyre]]. The first of the lyric poets was probably [[Archilochus of Paros]], circa [[700 BC]]. Only fragments remain of his work, as is the case with most of the poets. The few remnants suggest that he was an embittered adventurer who led a very turbulent life. 

The two major poets were [[Sappho]] and [[Pindar]]. Sappho, who lived in the period from [[610 BC]] to [[580 BC]], has always been admired for the beauty of her writing. Her themes were personal. They dealt with her friendships with and dislikes of other women, though her brother Charaxus was the subject of several poems. Unfortunately, only fragments of her poems remain. With [[Pindar]] the transition has been made from the preclassical to the classical age. He was born about [[518 BC]] and is considered the greatest of the Greek lyricists. His masterpieces were the poems that celebrated athletic victories in the games at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], [[Delphi]], [[Nemea]], and the [[Isthmus of Corinth]].

=== Tragedy ===

The Greeks invented the [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] forms and used them skillfully. They also invented [[drama]] and produced masterpieces that are still reckoned as drama's crowning achievement. In the age that followed the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], the awakened national spirit of [[Athens]] was expressed in hundreds of superb tragedies based on heroic and legendary themes of the past. The tragic plays grew out of simple choral songs and dialogues performed at festivals of the god [[Dionysus]]. Wealthy citizens were chosen to bear the expense of costuming and training the chorus as a public and religious duty. Attendance at the festival performances was regarded as an act of worship. Performances were held in the great open-air theater of Dionysus in Athens. All of the greatest poets competed for the prizes offered for the best plays. 

Of the hundreds of dramas written and performed during the classical age, only a limited number of plays by three authors have survived: [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]]. The earliest of the three was Aeschylus, who was born in [[525 BC]]. He wrote between 70 and 90 plays, of which only seven remain. Many of his dramas were arranged as trilogies, groups of three plays on a single theme. The [[Oresteia]] consisting of [[Agamemnon]], [[Choephoroi]] ([[The Libation Bearers]]), and [[Eumenides]] is the only surviving trilogy. The [[Persai]] ([[The Persians]]) is a song of triumph for the defeat of the [[Persians]]. [[Prometheus Bound]] is a retelling of the legend of the Titan Prometheus, a superhuman who stole fire from heaven and gave it to mankind. 

For about 16 years, between [[484]] and [[468 BC]], Aeschylus carried off prize after prize. But in 468 his place was taken by a new favorite, [[Sophocles]]. Sophocles' life covered nearly the whole period of Athens' "golden age." He won more than 20 victories at the [[Dionysian festivals]] and produced more than 100 plays, only seven of which remain. His drama ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'' is typical of his work: its heroine is a model of womanly self-sacrifice. He is probably better known, though, for ''[[Oedipus the King]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]''. 

The third of the great tragic writers was [[Euripides]]. He wrote at least 92 plays. Sixty-seven of these are known in the 20th century some just in part or by name only. Only 19 still exist in full. One of these is ''Rhesus'', which is believed by some scholars not to have been written by Euripides. His tragedies are about real men and women instead of idealized figures. The philosopher [[Aristotle]] called Euripides the most tragic of the poets because his plays were the most moving. His dramas are performed on the modern stage more often than those of any other ancient poet. His best-known work is probably the powerful ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', but his ''Alcestis'', ''Hippolytus'', ''Trojan Women'', ''Orestes'', and ''Electra'' are no less brilliant.

=== Comedy ===

Like tragedy, comedy arose from a ritual in honor of [[Dionysus]], but in this case the plays were full of frank obscenity, abuse, and insult. At [[Athens]] the comedies became an official part of the festival celebration in [[486 BC]], and prizes were offered for the best productions. As with the tragedians, few works still remain of the great comedic writers. Of the works of earlier writers, only some plays by [[Aristophanes]] exist. These are a treasure trove of comic presentation. He poked fun at everyone and every institution. For boldness of fantasy, for merciless insult, for unqualified indecency, and for outrageous and free political criticism, there is nothing to compare to the comedies of [[Aristophanes]]. In ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'' he held up Athenian democracy to ridicule. In ''[[The Clouds]]'' he attacked the philosopher [[Socrates]]. In ''[[Lysistrata]]'' he denounced war. Only 11 of his plays have survived. 

During the 4th century BC, there developed what was called the [[New Comedy]]. [[Menander]] is considered the best of its writers. Nothing remains from his competitors, however, so it is difficult to make comparisons. The plays of [[Menander]], of which only the Dyscolus ([[Misanthrope]]) now exists, did not deal with the great public themes about which [[Aristophanes]] wrote. He concentrated instead on fictitious characters from everyday life: stern fathers, young lovers, intriguing slaves, and others. In spite of his narrower focus, the plays of [[Menander]] influenced later generations. They were freely adapted by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poets [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]] in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC. The comedies of the [[France|French]] playwright [[Moli<U+00E8>re]] are reminiscent of those by [[Menander]].

=== Historiography === 

Two of the most excellent historians who have ever written flourished during Greece's classical age: [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]]. Herodotus is commonly called the father of history, and his "History" contains the first truly literary use of prose in [[Western literature]]. Of the two, Thucydides was the better historian. His critical use of sources, inclusion of documents, and laborious research made his [[History of the Peloponnesian War]] a significant influence on later generations of historians. 

A third historian of ancient Greece, [[Xenophon]], began his 'Hellenica' where Thucydides ended his work about 411 BC and carried his history to 362 BC. His writings were superficial in comparison to those of Thucydides, but he wrote with authority on military matters. He therefore is at his best in the [[Anabasis]], an account of his participation in a Greek [[mercenary]] army that tried to help the Persian [[Cyrus]] expel his brother from the throne. Xenophon also wrote three works in praise of the philosopher [[Socrates]], [[Socrates Apology]], [[Symposium]], and Memorabilia (Recollections of Socrates). Although both [[Xenophon]] and [[Plato]] knew Socrates, their accounts are very different, and it is interesting to compare the view of the military historian to that of the poet-philosopher.

=== Philosophy === 

The greatest achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy. There were many [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]], but three names tower above the rest: [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]]. It is impossible to calculate the enormous influence these thinkers have had on Western society . Socrates himself wrote nothing, but his thought (or a reasonable presentation of it) is believed to be given by Plato's early [[socratic dialogues]].  [[Aristotle]] is virtually without rivals among scientists and philosophers. The first sentence of his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' reads: "All men by nature desire to know." He has, therefore, been called the "Father of those who know." His medieval disciple [[Thomas Aquinas]] referred to him simply as "the Philosopher." Aristotle was a student at Plato's [[Academy]], and it is known that like his teacher he wrote dialogues, or conversations. None of these exists today. The body of writings that has come down to the present probably represents lectures that he delivered at his own school in Athens, the [[Lyceum]]. Even from these books the enormous range of his interests is evident. He explored matters other than those that are today considered philosophical. The treatises that exist cover logic, the physical and biological sciences, ethics, politics, and constitutional government. There are also treatises on ''[[On the Soul|The Soul]]'' and ''Rhetoric''. His ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' has had an enormous influence on literary theory and served as an interpretation of tragedy for more than 2,000 years. With his death in [[322 BC]], the classical era of Greek literature drew to a close. In the successive centuries of [[Greek literature|Greek]] writing there was never again such a brilliant flowering of genius as appeared in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. For today's readers there are excellent modern translations of classical Greek literature. Most are available in paperback editions.

== Hellenistic Age ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Plutarch]] -->

By [[338 BC]] all of the Greek [[city-states]] except [[Sparta]] had been conquered by [[Philip II of Macedon]]. Philip's son [[Alexander the Great]] extended his father's conquests greatly. In so doing he inaugurated what is called the [[Hellenistic Age]]s. Alexander's conquests were in the East, and Greek culture shifted first in that direction. Athens lost its preeminent status as the leader of Greek culture, and it was replaced temporarily by [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]]. After the rise of Rome, all the [[Mediterranean]] area was brought within one far-flung empire. Greek civilization then spread westward as well. Educated Romans learned to speak and write Greek, and they looked to Greece's golden age for inspiration in philosophy, poetry, and drama. So dependent did Roman writers become, in fact, that they produced very little that was not based upon Greek works, especially in drama and philosophy. 

The city of Alexandria in northern Egypt became, from the 3rd century BC, the outstanding center of Greek culture. It also soon attracted a large Jewish population, making it the largest center for Jewish scholarship in the ancient world. In addition, it later became a major focal point for the development of [[Christian]] thought. The [[Museum]], or Shrine to the Muses, which included the library and school, was founded by [[Ptolemy I]]. The institution was from the beginning intended as a great international school and library. The library, eventually containing more than a half million volumes, was mostly in Greek. It served as a repository for every Greek work of the classical period that could be found. Had the library lasted, it would have presented to modern scholars nearly every ancient book for study. The library lasted for several centuries but was destroyed during the reign of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Aurelian]] late in the 3rd century AD. A smaller library was destroyed by the Christians in 391 because it harbored so many non-Christian works.

One of the most valuable contributions of the Hellenistic period was the translation of the [[Old Testament]] into Greek. The work was done at Alexandria and completed by the end of the 2nd century BC. The name [[Septuagint]] means "seventy," from the tradition that there were 72 scholars who did the work. Since the language of the early [[Christian]] community was Greek, the Septuagint became its [[Bible]]. Other books not in the Hebrew Bible were also written in Greek and included what is called the [[Apocrypha]].

=== Hellenistic poetry === 

Later Greek poetry flourished primarily in the 3rd century BC. The chief poets were [[Theocritus]], [[Callimachus]], and [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]. Theocritus, who lived from about 310 to 250 BC, was the creator of pastoral poetry, a type that the Roman [[Virgil]] mastered in his [[Eclogues]]. Of his rural-farm poetry, [[Harvest Home]] is considered the best work. He also wrote mimes, poetic plays set in the country as well as minor epics and lyric poetry. 

Callimachus, who lived at the same time as Theocritus, worked his entire adult life at Alexandria, where he was cataloger of the library. Only fragments of his poetry survive. The most famous work was [[Aetia]] (Causes). It is a kind of poem called an elegy and in four books explains the legendary origin of obscure customs, festivals, and names. Its structure became a model for the work of the Roman poet [[Ovid]]. Of his elegies for special occasions, the best known is the 'Lock of Berenice', a piece of court poetry that was later adapted by the Roman Catullus. Callimachus also wrote short poems for special occasions and at least one short epic, the 'Ibis', which was directed against his former pupil Apollonius. 

Apollonius of Rhodes was born about 295 BC. He is best remembered for his epic the 'Argonautica', about Jason and his shipmates in search of the golden fleece. Apollonius studied under Callimachus, with whom he later quarreled. He also served as librarian at Alexandria for about 13 years. Apart from the 'Argonautica', he wrote poems on the foundation of cities as well as a number of epigrams. The Roman poet Virgil was strongly influenced by the 'Argonautica' in writing his [[Aeneid]]. Lesser 3rd-century poets include [[Aratus]] of Soli and [[Herodas]]. Aratus wrote the 'Phaenomena', a poetic version of a treatise on the stars by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], who had lived in the 4th century. Herodas wrote mimes reminiscent of those of Theocritus. His works give a hint of the popular entertainment of the times. Mime and pantomime were a major form of entertainment during the early Roman Empire

== The rise of Rome ==

While the transition from city-state to empire affected philosophy a great deal, shifing the emphasis from political theory to personal ethics, Greek letters continued to flourish both under the Successors (especially the Ptolemies) and under Roman rule.  Romans of literary or rhetorical inclination looked to Greek models, and Greek literature of all types continued to be read and produced both by native speakers of Greek and later by Roman authors as well.  A notable characteristic of this period was the expansion of literary criticism as a genre, particularly as exemplified by Demetrius, Pseudo-Longinus and Dionysius of Halicarnassus.  The Greek novel, typified by Chariton's ''Callirhoe'' and the ''Hero and Leander'' of Pseudo-Musaeus, also emerged.

=== Historiography === 

The significant historians in the period after Alexander were [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]], [[Polybius]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], [[Appian of Alexandria]], [[Arrian]], and [[Plutarch]]. The period of time they cover extended from late in the 4th century BC to the 2nd century AD. 

Timaeus was born in Sicily but spent most of his life in Athens. His 'History', though lost, is significant because of its influence on Polybius. In 38 books it covered the history of Sicily and Italy to the year 264 BC, which is where Polybius began his work. Timaeus also wrote the 'Olympionikai', a valuable chronological study of the Olympic Games. Polybius was born about 200 BC. He was brought to Rome as a hostage in 168. At Rome he became a friend of the general Scipio Aemilianus. He probably accompanied the general to Spain and North Africa in the wars against Carthage. He was with Scipio at the destruction of Carthage in 146. The history on which his reputation rests consisted of 40 books, five of which have been preserved along with various excerpts. They are a vivid recreation of Rome's rise to world power. A lost book, 'Tactics', was on military matters. 

Diodorus Siculus lived in the 1st century BC, the time of Julius Caesar and Augustus. He wrote a [[universal history]], 'Bibliotheca historica', in 40 books. Of these, the first five and the 11th through the 20th remain. The first two parts covered history through the early Hellenistic era. The third part takes the story to the beginning of Caesar's wars in Gaul, now France. Dionysius of Halicarnassus lived late in the 1st century BC. His history of Rome from its origins to the First Punic War (264 to 241 BC) is written from a Roman point of view, but it is carefully researched. He also wrote a number of other treatises, including 'On Imitation', 'Commentaries on the Ancient Orators', and 'On the Arrangement of Words'. 

Appian and Arrian both lived in the 2nd century AD. Appian wrote on Rome and its conquests, while Arrian is remembered for his work on the campaigns of Alexander the Great. Arrian served in the Roman army. His book therefore concentrates heavily on the military aspects of Alexander's life. Arrian also wrote a philosophical treatise, the 'Diatribai', based on the teachings of his mentor Epictetus . Best known of the late Greek historians to modern readers is Plutarch, who died about AD 119. His 'Parallel Lives' of great Greek and Roman leaders has been read by every generation since the work was first published. His other surviving work is the 'Moralia', a collection of essays on ethical, religious, political, physical, and literary topics. 

==== Science and mathematics ==== 
''See also: [[Greek mathematics]], [[Greek astronomy]], [[Medicine in ancient Greece]]''

[[Eratosthenes of Alexandria]], who died about [[194 BC]], wrote on astronomy and geography, but his work is known mainly from later summaries. He is credited with being the first person to measure the Earth's circumference. Much that was written by the mathematicians [[Euclid]] and [[Archimedes]] has been preserved. Euclid is known for his ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', much of which was drawn from his predecessor [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]]. The ''Elements'' is a treatise on geometry, and it has exerted a continuing influence on mathematics. From Archimedes several treatises have come down to the present. Among them are ''Measurement of the Circle'', in which he worked out the value of pi; ''Method Concerning Mechanical Theorems'', on his work in mechanics; ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]''; and ''On Floating Bodies''. A [[Archimedes Palimpsest|manuscript of his works]] is currently being studied.

The physician [[Galen]], in the history of ancient science, is the most significant person in medicine after [[Hippocrates]], who laid the foundation of medicine in the 5th century BC. Galen lived during the 2nd century AD. He was a careful student of anatomy, and his works exerted a powerful influence on medicine for the next 1,400 years . [[Strabo]], who died about AD 23, was a geographer and historian. His 'Historical Sketches' in 47 volumes has nearly all been lost. His ''[[Geographica (Strabo)|Geographical Sketches]]'' remain as the only existing ancient book covering the whole range of people and countries known to the Greeks and Romans through the time of [[Augustus]]. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], who lived in the 2nd century AD, was also a geographer. His ''Description of Greece'' is an invaluable guide to what are now ancient ruins. His book takes the form of a tour of Greece, starting in [[Athens]]. The accuracy of his descriptions has been proved by archaeological excavations. The scientist of the Roman period who had the greatest influence on later generations was undoubtedly the astronomer [[Ptolemy]]. He lived during the 2nd century AD, though little is known of his life. His masterpiece, originally entitled ''The Mathematical Collection'', has come to the present under the title ''[[Almagest]]'', as it was translated by Arab astronomers with that title. It was Ptolemy who devised a detailed description of an [[Geocentric model|Earth-centered universe]], a notion that dominated astronomical thinking for more than 1,300 years. The Ptolemaic view of the universe endured until [[Copernicus]], [[Galileo]], [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]], and other early modern astronomers replaced it with [[heliocentrism]].

=== Philosophy ===

Later philosophical works were no match for Plato and Aristotle. [[Epictetus]], who died about AD 135, was associated with the moral philosophy of the [[Stoics]]. His teachings were collected by his pupil Arrian in the 'Discourses' and the 'Encheiridion' (Manual of Study). [[Diogenes Laertius]], who lived in the 3rd century, wrote 'Lives, Teachings, and Sayings of Famous Philosophers', a useful sourcebook. Another major philosopher of his period was [[Plotinus]].  He transformed Plato's philosophy into a school called [[Neoplatonism]]. His 'Enneads' had a wide-ranging influence on European thought until at least the 17th century.
