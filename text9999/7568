'''Zaharije Ostoji<U+0107>''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|<U+0417><U+0430><U+0445><U+0430><U+0440><U+0438><U+0458><U+0435> <U+041E><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0458><U+0438><U+045B>}}; 1907 <U+2013> April 1945) was the chief of the operational, organisational and intelligence branches of the [[Chetnik]] Supreme Command led by [[Dra<U+017E>a Mihailovi<U+0107>]] in [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] during [[World War II]]. [[Montenegrins|Montenegrin]] by birth, Ostoji<U+0107> was a [[major]] in the [[Yugoslav Royal Air Force]] prior to the [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]], and was involved in the coup that deposed [[Prince Paul]] of Yugoslavia on 27 March 1941. After the coup, he escorted Prince Paul to exile in Greece, and was in Cairo at the time of the invasion in April. In September 1941, he was landed on the Italian-occupied [[Kingdom of Montenegro (1941<U+2013>1944)|Montenegrin coast]] along with a British [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) liaison officer and two companions. He escorted the SOE officer to the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia]] and introduced him to the [[Yugoslav Partisan]] leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] then Mihailovi<U+0107>. Ostoji<U+0107> soon became Mihailovi<U+0107>'s [[Chief of Staff]], and after the German attempt to capture the Chetnik leader during [[Operation Mihailovi<U+0107>]] in December 1941, brought the Chetnik Supreme staff to Montenegro where they were re-united with Mihailovi<U+0107> in June 1942. During the remainder of 1942, Ostoji<U+0107> launched a counter-attack against [[Usta<U+0161>e]] troops of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] returning to the eastern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnian]] town of [[Fo<U+010D>a]] where they were expected to continue their genocidal anti-[[Serb]] policies. He then oversaw large-scale massacres of civilians and burning of [[Bosniaks|Muslim]] villages in the border region between Montenegro and the [[Sand<U+017E>ak]].

While the Chetniks were an anti-Axis movement in their long-range goals and did engage in marginal resistance activities for limited periods, they also carried out almost throughout the war a tactical or selective [[Collaborationism|collaboration]] with the occupation authorities against the Partisans. The Chetnik movement adopted a policy of collaboration with the Axis powers, and engaged in cooperation to one degree or another by establishing ''modus vivendi'' or operating as auxiliary forces under Axis control. This was demonstrated in late 1942 and early 1943, when Ostoji<U+0107> planned and oversaw the Chetnik involvement in the large Axis anti-Partisan offensive [[Case White]] alongside [[Royal Italian Army (1940<U+2013>1946)|Italian troops]]. In 1944, he became a leader of the Chetnik forces in [[Herzegovina]], and along with [[Dobroslav Jev<U+0111>evi<U+0107>]] was involved in attempts to come to terms with the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]]. In late 1944, as the Partisans tightened their grip on the country and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] captured [[Belgrade]], he re-joined Mihailovi<U+0107> in northeastern Bosnia but they could not agree on what course of action to take. Ostoji<U+0107>, along with with Chetnik leaders [[Pavle <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>]] and [[Petar Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107>]] and Chetnik ideologue [[Dragi<U+0161>a Vasi<U+0107>]] decided to move west to the area of the [[Ljubljana Gap]] in modern-day [[Slovenia]] where other friendly forces were concentrating. In early April 1945, faced with attacks by the Partisans and the [[Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia]] (HOS) along their route, the combined Chetnik force was defeated by HOS forces in the [[Battle of Lijev<U+010D>e Field]], after which Ostoji<U+0107> was captured and killed.

==Early life==
Zaharije Ostoji<U+0107> was born in 1907 in the village of [[Gluhi Do]], near the [[Adriatic]] seaport of [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] in the [[Principality of Montenegro]].{{sfn|''Hrvatski List''|17 September 2012}} He joined the [[Yugoslav Royal Air Force]] and prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]] had risen to the rank of major. His sister was married to [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] [[Brigadier general|Brigadier General]] [[Ljubo Novakovi<U+0107>]].<ref>[[#Kurapovna_2009|Kurapovna (2009)]], p. 91</ref>

==To Cairo and back==
{{see also|Yugoslav coup of 1941}}
After the outbreak of World War II, the government of [[Regency (government)|Regent]] [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia]] declared its [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].<ref>[[#Pavlowitch_2008|Pavlowitch (2008)]], p. 8</ref> Despite this, and with the aim of securing his southern flank for the pending attack on the [[Soviet Union]], [[Adolf Hitler]] began placing heavy pressure on the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] to sign the [[Tripartite Pact]] and join the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. After some delay, the Yugoslav government conditionally signed the Pact on 25 March 1941. Two days later a bloodless [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] deposed Prince Paul and declared 17 year old Prince [[Peter II of Yugoslavia]] of age.<ref>[[#Pavlowitch_2008|Pavlowitch (2008)]], p. 10<U+2013>12</ref> Ostoji<U+0107> was involved in the coup through his close relationship with one of the main instigators, the commander of the Yugoslav Royal Air Force Brigadier General [[Borivoje Mirkovi<U+0107>]].<ref name="Kurapovna84">[[#Kurapovna_2009|Kurapovna (2009)]], p. 84</ref> Ostoji<U+0107> escorted Prince Paul to exile in [[Greece]] and then travelled on to [[Cairo]]. Following the subsequent German-led [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and the Yugoslav capitulation 11 days later, Ostoji<U+0107> remained in Cairo until he was selected to join a combined British-Yugoslavian [[Special Operations Executive]] team which was to infiltrate into occupied Yugoslavia and make contact with [[Resistance during World War II|resistance groups]]. The other members of the team were [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] [[Duane Hudson|Duane 'Bill' Hudson]], a fellow Yugoslav Air Force officer, [[Major]] Mirko Lalatovi<U+0107>, and a radio operator. They flew from Cairo to [[Malta]] on 13 September 1941, before being landed from the British submarine [[HMS Triumph (N18)|HMS ''Triumph'']] on the Montenegrin coast near [[Petrovac, Montenegro|Petrovac]] between 20 and 22 September 1941.<ref name="Kurapovna84"/> They quickly came into contact with Montenegrin [[Yugoslav Partisan|Partisans]], including [[Milovan <U+0110>ilas]] and [[Arso Jovanovi<U+0107>]], who escorted Hudson and Ostoji<U+0107> to Partisan-held [[U<U+017E>ice]] in the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia]].{{#tag:ref|Official name of the occupied territory<ref>[[#Hehn_1971|Hehn (1971)]], p. 350</ref>|group="Note"}} While Hudson familiarised himself with the Partisans, Ostoji<U+0107> went on to Mihailovi<U+0107>'s headquarters at [[Ravna Gora (Suvobor)|Ravna Gora]], but after briefing Mihailovi<U+0107> went back to escort Hudson to Ravna Gora, arriving there on 25 October. When he first arrived at Ravna Gora, Ostoji<U+0107> had delivered a message to Mihailovi<U+0107> from the War Minister of the Yugoslav government-in-exile, Bogoljub Ili<U+0107>, assuring him of the official support of the government-in-exile, but stating that "a rebellion would not be tolerated".<ref>[[#Roberts_1973|Roberts (1973)]], pp. 27<U+2013>29</ref><ref>[[#Milazzo_1975|Milazzo (1975)]], pp. 33<U+2013>34</ref><ref>[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], p. 143</ref> Ostoji<U+0107> also told Mihailovi<U+0107> that the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|communists]] had taken control of Montenegro.<ref>[[#Pavlowitch_2008|Pavlowitch (2008)]], p. 79</ref> Ostoji<U+0107> and Lalatovi<U+0107> then assumed senior staff positions in Mihailovi<U+0107>'s supreme command headquarters.<ref>[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], p. 125</ref>

==Move to Montenegro==
After Mihailovi<U+0107> went on the run in early December 1941 in the wake of [[Operation Uzice]], [[Operation Mihailovic]] and the split with the Partisans, Ostoji<U+0107> maintained a small headquarters consisting mainly of the intelligence branch, which remained close to Mihailovi<U+0107> and his small personal staff as he moved around the [[Rudnik mountain]] area during the remaining winter months of 1941<U+2013>1942. Mihailovi<U+0107> eventually made his way to Montenegro, where he arrived in June 1942. Ostoji<U+0107>, Hudson and other officers joined him soon after, travelling through Italian-held towns by truck disguised as troops of the [[Government of National Salvation|Nedi<U+0107> regime]].<ref>[[#Roberts_1973|Roberts (1973)]], p. 38 & p. 57</ref><ref>[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], p. 200</ref> In August 1942, Ostoji<U+0107> launched a counterattack against Usta<U+0161>e troops returning to Fo<U+010D>a as the Italians withdrew their garrisons from the hinterland. The Chetniks feared the Usta<U+0161>e were about to unleash another round of genocidal violence on the Serb population in the area.<ref>[[#Milazzo_1975|Milazzo (1975)]], p. 96</ref>

In November 1942, Ostoji<U+0107> was encouraged by Mihailovi<U+0107> to wage a campaign of terror against the [[Bosniak|Muslim population]] living along the borders of Montenegro and the [[Sand<U+017E>ak]], and subsequently reported that Chetniks had destroyed 21 villages and killed about 1,300 people.<ref>[[#Milazzo_1975|Milazzo (1975)]], p. 109</ref> Between 30 November and 2 December 1942, Ostoji<U+0107> represented Mihailovi<U+0107> at the Conference of Young Chetnik Intellectuals of Montenegro at the village of <U+0160>ahovi<U+0107>i near [[Bijelo Polje]] in the Sand<U+017E>ak, which was also attended by <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>.<ref name="Tomasevich 1975 p. 171">[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], p. 171</ref> The conference was dominated by <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> and its resolutions "expressed extremism and intolerance",<ref name="Pavlowitch112">[[#Pavlowitch_2008|Pavlowitch (2008)]], p. 112</ref> as well as an agenda which was focused on restoring the pre-war status quo in Yugoslavia implemented in its initial stages by a Chetnik dictatorship. It also laid claim to parts of the territory of Yugoslavia's neighbors.<ref name="Tomasevich 1975 p. 171"/><ref name="Pavlowitch112"/>

==Operation Weiss==
A few weeks after the conference, Mihailovi<U+0107> sent Ostoji<U+0107> to establish a forward headquarters in [[Kalinovik]] in south-eastern Bosnia. Ostoji<U+0107> was to command an operation aimed at encircling and destroying Partisan forces in Bosnia, which was to utilise Chetnik units serving as Italian auxiliaries in Herzegovina and Montenegro, as well as other Chetnik units in the [[Lika]] region, northern Bosnia and northern [[Dalmatia]].<ref>[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], pp. 233<U+2013>234</ref> The plan was predicated on an Allied landing on the Dalmatian coast, which Mihailovi<U+0107> believed was imminent. The outline concept was that the Chetniks would set up a corridor through the Italian occupied zone of the NDH as far as the Partisan liberated area in western Bosnia and Lika, neutralising the Italians through a combination of vague promises, encouraging them to surrender, and disarming them if necessary. The plan was finalised by early December 1942 at Mihailovi<U+0107>'s headquarters in Montenegro, and operations were planned to commence on 5 January 1943. However, the plan assumed that Mihailovi<U+0107>'s forces were unified, which they were not, and also that his authority extended to many more Chetniks than it did in reality.<ref>[[#Pavlowitch_2008|Pavlowitch (2008)]], pp. 156<U+2013>157</ref>

However, what transpired instead was that the Chetniks that were preparing for the "march on Bosnia" were drawn into closer collaboration with the Axis during the second phase of [[Case White]] that took place in the [[Neretva]] and Rama river valleys in late February 1943. During this offensive, between 12,000<U+2013>15,000 Chetniks fought alongside Italian forces, and in one case alongside German and Croatian troops against the Partisans.<ref name="Tomasevich231-43">[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], pp. 231<U+2013>243</ref> Despite the fact that the Chetniks were an anti-Axis movement in their long-range goals and did engage in marginal resistance activities for limited periods,<ref>[[#Milazzo_1975|Milazzo (1975)]], pp. 103<U+2013>105</ref> their involvement in Case White is one of the most significant examples of their tactical or selective [[Collaborationism|collaboration]] with the Axis occupation forces.<ref name="Milazzo p182">[[#Milazzo 1975|Milazzo (1975)]], p.182</ref> In this instance, the participating Chetniks operated as legalised auxiliary forces under Italian control.<ref>[[#Tomasevich 1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], pp. 224<U+2013>225</ref><ref>[[#Pavlowitch_2008|Pavlowitch (2008)]], pp. 65<U+2013>67</ref>

The plan that Ostoji<U+0107> drew up called for the Chetniks to remain south of the Neretva to avoid being outflanked by the Partisans. However, this essentially defensive strategy was rejected by Herzegovinian Chetnik commanders such as [[Dobroslav Jev<U+0111>evi<U+0107>]] and [[Bajo Stani<U+0161>i<U+0107>]], who wished to follow the Axis-led offensive strategy. This placed Ostoji<U+0107> in a very difficult position, with some of his key detachment commanders following the orders of the Italians rather than his, while the Chetniks were reliant on Italian [[Close air support|air]] and [[artillery]] support, particularly around [[Jablanica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Jablanica]].<ref>[[#Milazzo_1975|Milazzo (1975)]], pp. 122<U+2013>123</ref> Ostoji<U+0107> subsequently changed his mind and supported the Italian offensive plans, launching an attack against the Partisans retreating from Jablanica to [[Prozor-Rama|Prozor]] on 27 February 1943. The attack was indecisive and Ostoji<U+0107> reprimanded the detachment commanders responsible, particularly Stani<U+0161>i<U+0107>.<ref>[[#Milazzo_1975|Milazzo (1975)]], p. 124</ref>

During this phase Ostoji<U+0107> first asked Jev<U+0111>evi<U+0107> to obtain more supplies from the Italians, and then when they refused, threatened to declare war on them.<ref>[[#Pavlowitch_2008|Pavlowitch (2008)]], p. 159</ref> By early March, just as the Partisans were forcing a crossing of the Neretva at Jablanica, Mihailovi<U+0107> joined Ostoji<U+0107>. In a letter to one of his other Montenegrin Chetnik commanders, Mihailovi<U+0107> stated that he was managing the whole operation through Ostoji<U+0107>, although Mihailovi<U+0107> later denied that he was in charge of the operation when questioned during his trial by a Partisan court after the war.<ref name="Tomasevich231-43"/> Mihailovi<U+0107> and Ostoji<U+0107> realised that the large concentrations of Chetnik troops in and around [[Mostar]] and the nearby [[bauxite]] mines were likely to draw German attention, and while they were focused on this issue, the Partisans forced a crossing of the Neretva.<ref>[[#Milazzo_1975|Milazzo (1975)]], p. 128</ref> 

Within a week of Mihailovi<U+0107>'s arrival the Partisans had successfully crossed the Neretva, and within another week they had forced the Chetniks to withdraw, losing [[Nevesinje]] then Kalinovik to the Partisans before the end of March. During the fighting, Chetnik commanders had been ill-disciplined and had failed to cooperate, causing Ostoji<U+0107> to threaten them with [[Court-martial|courts martial]] and [[summary execution]].  Mihailovi<U+0107> ordered Ostoji<U+0107> to pull the Chetniks back towards positions on the line of the [[Drina]]-[[Piva (river)|Piva]] rivers, some {{convert|80|<U+2013>|90|km|mi}} kilometres southwest of Jablanica. By this point the Chetniks had suffered heavy losses, and the Partisans broke through the combined Italian-Chetnik defence line in early April. In a report dated November 1944, Colonel [[Bill Bailey (officer)|S.W. "Bill" Bailey]], the senior British liaison officer with the Chetniks during the war, stated that both Ostoji<U+0107> and Major [[Vojislav Luka<U+010D>evi<U+0107>]] had been very critical of Mihailovi<U+0107>'s "foolhardy, though brave, tactical handling" of Chetnik forces during Case White, which had "contributed largely to the failure of operations".<ref>[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], pp. 248<U+2013>250</ref> However, Ostoji<U+0107> himself did not possess the necessary authority with his subordinate commanders, had been unable to cope with the rapidly changing situation, had adopted an unpopular and ineffective defensive strategy, and had then blamed the detachment commanders for the Chetnik failures.<ref>[[#Milazzo_1975|Milazzo (1975)]], p. 141</ref>

==1943<U+2013>1944==
In July 1943, the Montenegrin Partisan leader <U+0110>ilas contacted both Ostoji<U+0107> and Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> to establish their willingness to work jointly against the Axis occupiers, given that a new government-in-exile was about to be established without Mihailovi<U+0107>. They reported this contact to Mihailovi<U+0107> who threatened to exclude them from his Chetnik organisation if they maintained contact with the Partisans.<ref>[[#Pavlowitch_2008|Pavlowitch (2008)]], pp. 169<U+2013>170</ref>

By September 1944, Ostoji<U+0107> had been promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]], and was the Chetnik area commander in eastern Bosnia. In early September 1944, as Mihailovi<U+0107> had been removed as Minister of the Army, Navy and Air Force with the demise of the [[Bo<U+017E>idar Puri<U+0107>|Puri<U+0107>]] government-in-exile, Ostoji<U+0107> tried to make contact with [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] in Italy, and agreed with Luka<U+010D>evi<U+0107> to issue a proclamation to the people explaining that they were going to attack the Germans. After 12 September 1943, when King Peter called for all in Yugoslavia to rally around Tito, he and Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> warned Mihailovi<U+0107> that their men were losing their will to fight the Partisans. Concerned that the Russians would hand the Chetniks over to the Partisans, he then contacted the [[United States]] [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) liaison officer with the Chetniks, [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Robert H. McDowell]], but was unable to arrange for the Chetniks to be placed under American command.<ref>[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], p. 395</ref><ref>[[#Pavlowitch_2008|Pavlowitch (2008)]], p. 232</ref><ref>[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], pp. 425<U+2013>426</ref>

==Retreat and death==
After the fall of Belgrade on 20 October 1944, Mihailovi<U+0107> and a force of a few hundred of his Chetniks withdrew from Serbian territory, crossed the Drina and based themselves in the [[Majevica]] mountain area north of [[Tuzla]] in north-eastern Bosnia.<ref>[[#Pavlowitch_2008|Pavlowitch (2008)]], p. 237</ref> Ostoji<U+0107>, who was commanding Herzegovinian Chetniks, was joined by <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> and his Montenegrin Chetniks and together they withdrew towards Mihailovi<U+0107>.<ref>[[#Pavlowitch_2008|Pavlowitch (2008)]], p. 255</ref>

From the time he joined Mihailovi<U+0107> in northeastern Bosnia, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> was very critical of Mihailovi<U+0107>'s leadership, and argued strongly for all the remaining Chetnik troops to move to the area of the [[Ljubljana Gap]] in modern-day [[Slovenia]]. At this point Ostoji<U+0107> and Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> were also questioning Mihailovi<U+0107>'s plans.<ref>[[#Pavlowitch_2008|Pavlowitch (2008)]], p. 241</ref> When Mihailovi<U+0107> remained unconvinced, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> decided to move to the Ljubljana Gap independent of Mihailovi<U+0107>, and arranged for [[Dimitrije Ljoti<U+0107>]]'s forces already in the Ljubljana Gap to meet him near [[Biha<U+0107>]] in western Bosnia to assist his movement. When he left Mihailovi<U+0107>, he was joined by Chetnik ideologue [[Dragi<U+0161>a Vasi<U+0107>]] and the Chetnik detachments commanded by Ostoji<U+0107> and Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> as well as a large number of refugees.<ref name="Tomasevich447-448">[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], pp. 447<U+2013>448</ref>

In order to get to Biha<U+0107>, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> made a safe-conduct agreement with elements of the [[Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia]] (HOS) and with the Montenegrin separatist [[Sekula Drljevi<U+0107>]]. The details of the agreement are not known, but it appears <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>, Ostoji<U+0107> and Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> and their troops were meant to cross the [[Sava]] river into [[Slavonia]] where they would be aligned with Drljevi<U+0107> as the "Montenegrin National Army" with <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> retaining operational command.<ref name="Tomasevich447<U+2013>448">[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], pp. 446<U+2013>448</ref> The Chetniks however, appear to have tried to outsmart the HOS forces and Drljevi<U+0107> by sending their sick and wounded across the river, but retaining their fit troops south of the river, after which they began moving them westwards. Harassed by both the HOS troops and Partisans, they reached the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] river, which they began to cross. In the [[Battle of Lijev<U+010D>e Field]], north of [[Banja Luka]], the combined Chetnik force was badly beaten by a strong HOS force which possessed German-supplied tanks.<ref name="Tomasevich447<U+2013>448"/>

Following this defeat and the defection of one of their sub-units to Drljevi<U+0107>, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> was induced to negotiate directly with the leaders of the HOS forces about the further movement of the Chetniks towards the Ljubljana Gap. However, this appears to have been a trap, as he was attacked and captured by them on his way to the meeting. Following this, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>, Vasi<U+0107>, Ostoji<U+0107> and Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> were killed, along with some [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] priests and others.<ref name="Tomasevich447<U+2013>448"/>
