On March 26, 2007, Tequila announced in her MySpace blog that she would be filming a [[reality show]] for [[VH1]].<ref>[http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=41736&blogID=246071836 Tila Tequila's MySpace Blog]</ref>  Filming started in May 2007, but the show was moved to VH1's sister network [[MTV]] that summer. On October 9, 2007, ''A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila'' aired on MTV. The program is a [[bisexual]]-themed reality dating show where sixteen [[heterosexuality|straight]] men and sixteen [[lesbian]] women compete for Tequila's affections, the twist being that the contestants were not aware of her bisexuality<ref name="mtv" /> until the end of the first episode.

===Music career===   
Tila used modeling as a stepping stone for other ventures. At age 20, she acted on her interest in rock music and started looking for bands willing to have her join. She eventually assembled a band called Beyond Betty Jean, for which she was singer and songwriter. Following the breakup of Beyond Betty Jean, Tila started working in recording studios to sharpen her vocal skills and wrote music.<ref name="TilasHotSpotQuickBio"/> Tila Tequila became the lead singer of a band called Jealousy, which has released songs over the Internet. Jealousy has appeared on [[MySpace Records]]' inaugural compilation album, released through MySpace Records and [[Interscope Records|Interscope]].{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

A major turn in Tequila's music career occurred during the April 24, 2006 taping of [[MTV]]'s ''[[Total Request Live]]''. In an interview with the ''TRL'' VJs, [[will.i.am]] announced that Tequila was signed to the Will.I.Am music group, a record label under [[A&M Records]]. Despite her major-label signing, Tequila independently released her first single "[[I Love U (Tila Tequila song)|I Love U]]" through [[iTunes]] on February 27, 2007, justifying the independent release through her desire to become famous by herself.<ref name="Brown" /> She shot a music video for the song, which is available for free after the song is downloaded. A preview for the video debuted on February 14, 2007 on her MySpace page. The video was also released via mobile phones.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

In March 2007, Washington-based record label The Saturday Team released an EP called ''[[Sex (Tila Tequila EP)|Sex]]'', by Tila Tequila.<ref name="Brown"/> On July 27, 2007, Italian website MusicBlob reported that The Saturday Team and distributor Icon Music Entertainment Services sued Nguyen over breaching her contract related to the album.<ref name="MusicBlob">MusicBlob (July 27, 2007). [http://www.musicblob.it/what-happened-to-tila-tequila-a-musicblob-exclusive.html "What happened to Tila Tequila?"]. MusicBlob. Retrieved July 27, 2007.</ref> However, Tila, through a MySpace bulletin,<ref name="MusicBlob" />, claimed the EP was not authorized for release by her, and was removed from most retailers. 

On October 9, 2007, the same day her reality show ''[[A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila]]'' premiered, Tila released her second official single, "[[Stripper Friends]]"<ref>[http://music.aol.com/popeater/2007/10/10/tila-tequila-gets-a-little-help-from-her-stripper-friends/  "Tila Tequila Gets a Little Help From Her 'Stripper Friends'"], ''Popeater''. Retrieved November 14, 2008.</ref>. In mid-November Tila shot the video for her third single "[[Paralyze (song)|Paralyze]]". The video was shot at an upscale [[Los Angeles]] condo. Scenes were shot featuring Tila with a long dark brown wig on (at the time, she had a short blond bob) as well as without the wig. However, the scenes were originally cut from the video.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

She shot the music video for "Stripper Friends" in early December 2007 at a [[Los Angeles]] strip club. The video premiered via [[Yahoo! Music]] on February 26, 2008 and was released to [[iTunes]] on March 4, 2008. The single failed to chart. On April 2, 2008 the music video for "Paralyze" was released, again via [[Yahoo! Music]] and the single was released to [[iTunes]] on April 8, 2008.<ref>[http://www.tilashotspot.buzznet.com/web/tila/journals/tilatequila/entry/2158921/paralyze-teaser-clip Tila's Hot Spot News]</ref>

In July 2008 the song "Hideaway" was released through Tila's MySpace and received good response from fans. The song was taken down later that same day, although Tila did announce<ref>[http://www.tilashotspot.buzznet.com/web/tila/ce/news/2630361/ Tila's Hot Spot News]</ref> that she would be releasing her first full-length debut album in the winter. She also stated that because of the fan response, the new song "Hideaway" would appear on the album.

On August 7, 2008, Tila stated in a blog that she has been "in the studio 24/7 cooking up a writing dance storm for [her] new album" and that the album would be titled ''Tila Tequila: I Have Tourettes''. <ref>[http://www.tilashotspot.buzznet.com/web/tila/ce/news/2819431 Tila's Hot Spot News]</ref>

===''Hooking Up with Tila Tequila''===
On December 2, 2008, Tila released a [[self-help book]], ''Hooking Up with Tila Tequila: A Guide to Love, Fame, Happiness, Success, and Being the Life of the Party'' (ISBN 9781439101537). She herself has said of the book, "After all these years, there are so many fan questions, and I always have given little spurts of advice, but I always sensed that everyone wanted more. I can't just write a blog on it, because it would be the size of a book... So I decided, 'Why don't I put it all together?' That way they can keep it as memorabilia and go back to it whenever they need help and hopefully inspire them."<ref>[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6560000.html "Scribner Signs Internet Celeb Tila Tequila"], ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''.
