{{SpanishMissions}}

The '''Spanish missions in the Sonoran Desert''' are a series of [[Jesuit]] [[Catholic]] [[religious]] outposts established by the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] and other orders for [[religious conversion]]s of the [[Pima people|Pima]] and [[Tohono O'odham]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] residing in the Sonoran Desert. An added goal was giving Spain a [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonial presence]] in their frontier territory of the [[Sonora y Sinaloa|Sonora y Sinaloa Province]] in the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], and relocating  by [[Indian Reductions]] (''Reducciones de Indios'') settlements and [[encomienda]]s for agricultural, ranching, and mining labor. 

==Geography==
The missions are in an area of the [[Sonoran Desert]], then called "[[Pimer<U+00ED>a Alta]] de Sonora y Sinaloa" (Upper Pima  of Sonora and Sinaloa), now divided between the [[Mexican state]] of [[Sonora]] and the [[U.S. state]] of [[Arizona]]. 

==Father Kino==
From around 1520, [[Kingdom of Castile|Spain]] had maintained a number of missions throughout ''[[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Virreinato de Nueva Espa<U+00F1>a]]'' (the Viceroyalty of New Spain) consisting of [[Mexico]] and portions of what today are the [[Southwestern United States]], in order to establish colonization and control of the territory and resources.

In the Spring of 1687, a Jesuit missionary named [[Father Kino|Father Eusebio Francisco Kino]] lived and worked with the Native Americans (including the [[Sobaipuri]]) in the area called the "[[Pimer<U+00ED>a Alta]]," or "Upper Pima Country,"  which presently is located in northern [[Sonora]] and southern [[Arizona]]. During Father Eusebio Kino's stay in the Pimer<U+00ED>a Alta, he founded over twenty missions in eight mission districts.  

It was rumored that the Jesuit priests had amassed fortunes <!---on the peninsula":  what's that refer to? Peninsular Spain or Baja Calif. ?---> and were becoming very powerful.  On February 3, 1768, [[Charles III of Spain|King Carlos III]] ordered the Jesuits forcibly expelled from [[New Spain]] and returned to the home country. Despite the order, many Jesuits remained in and around the present day [[Tucson, Arizona]] as late as the 1780s.
