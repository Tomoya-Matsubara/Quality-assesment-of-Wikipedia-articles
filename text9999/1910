The '''Black-necked Stork''' (''Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus'') is a tall long-necked wading [[Aves|bird]] in the [[stork]] family. It is a resident species across [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] with a disjunct population in [[Australia]]. It lives in wetland habitats to forage for a wide range of animal prey. Adult birds of both sexes have a heavy bill and are patterned in white and glossy blacks, but the sexes differ in the colour of the iris. In Australia, it is sometimes called a [[Jabiru]] although that name refers to a stork species found in the Americas. It is one of the few storks that is strongly territorial when feeding.

==Description==
[[File:JabiruMcArthurRiver.jpg|left|thumb|Adult female in flight at the [[McArthur River]] in the [[Northern Territory]] of [[Australia]] ]]
The Black-necked Stork is a large bird, 130<U+2013>150&nbsp;cm (51<U+2013>60&nbsp;inches) tall having a 230-cm (91-inch) wingspan. The average weight is around 4100&nbsp;grams.<ref name=delHoyo/><ref name=Hancock>{{cite book|author=Hancock, J & JA Kushlan & MP Kahl|year=1992|title=Storks, Ibises and Spoonbills of the World|publisher=Academic Press}}</ref> The [[plumage]] patterns are conspicuous with younger birds differing from adults. Adults have a glossy bluish-black iridescent head, neck, secondary flight feathers and tail; a coppery-brown crown; a bright white back and belly; bill black with a slightly concave upper edge; and bright red legs. The sexes are identical but the adult female has a yellow iris while the adult male has it brown. Juveniles younger than 6 months have a brownish iris; a distinctly smaller and straighter beak; a fluffy appearance; brown head, neck, upper back, wings and tail; a white belly; and dark legs. Juveniles older than 6 months have a mottled appearance especially on the head and neck where the iridescence is partly developed; dark-brown outer primaries; white inner primaries that forms a shoulder patch when the wings are closed; a heavy beak identical in size to adults but still straighter; and dark to pale-pink legs.<ref name=flocks>{{cite journal|title=Factors affecting formation of flocks of unusual size and composition in Black-necked Storks (''Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus'') in Australia and India|author=Sundar KSG & GP Clancy & N Shah|year=2006|journal=Emu|volume=106|pages=253<U+2013>258}}</ref> Like most storks, the Black-necked Stork flies with the neck outstretched, not retracted like a [[heron]].

First described by [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]] as ''Mycteria asiatica'', this species was later placed in the genus ''Xenorhynchus'' based on morphology.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peters, J.L. |year=1931|title=Check-list of birds of the world|pages=1<U+2013>345|publisher=Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts}}</ref> Based on behavioural similarities, Kahl<ref name=kahl/> suggested the placement of the species in the genus ''Ephippiorhynchus'', which then included a single species, the [[Saddle-billed Stork]]. This placement of both the Black-necked Stork and Saddle-billed Stork under the same genera was later supported by osteological and behavioural data,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Concordance between classifications of the Ciconiidae based on behavioral and morphological data|journal=Journal of Ornithology|volume=125| issue=1|year=1984|doi=10.1007/BF01652936|pages=25<U+2013>37|author=Wood, DS}}</ref> and DNA-DNA hybridisation and Cytochrome - ''b'' data.<ref name=Slikas1997>{{cite journal|title=Phylogeny of the avian family Ciconiidae (Storks) based on cytochrome ''b'' sequences and DNA - DNA hybridisation distances|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=8|issue=3|year=1997|pages=275<U+2013>300|author=Slikas, B.}}</ref> The genera ''Xenorhynchus'' and ''Ephippiorhynchus'' were both erected at the same time, and as first revisor, Kahl<ref name=kahl/> selected the latter as the valid genus for the two species.

This recommendation was based on the disjunct distributions and differences in the iridescent coloration of the neck which the authors suggested might reflect different behavioral displays. This recommendation has not been followed and a subsequent study did not find consistent differences in the colours.<ref name=Hancock/> Analysis of the [[cytochrome b]] mitochondrial sequences however showed significant genetic divergence.<ref name=Slikas1997/> The genetic distance of a stork presumed to be ''Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus asiaticus'' from a confirmed individual of ''E. a. australis'' was 2.1%, much greater than the distances between other conspecific storks.

The largest population of this species occurs in Australia, where it is found from the Ashburton River, near Onslow, Western Australia across northern Australia to north-east New South Wales. It extends inland in the Kimberley area to south of Halls Creek; in the Northern Territory to Hooker Creek and Daly Waters; and in Queensland inland to the Boulia area and the New South Wales border, with some records as far south as the north-west plains of New South Wales, along the coast of Sydney and formerly bred near the Shoalvahen River.<ref name=Marchant>{{cite book|editor=Marchant, S. & Higgins, P.

Black-necked Storks forage in a variety of natural and artificial wetland habitats. They frequently use freshwater, natural wetland habitats such as lakes, ponds, marshes, flooded grasslands, oxbow lakes, swamps, rivers and water meadows.<ref name=delHoyo/><ref name=Hancock/> Freshwater, artificial wetland habitats used by these storks include flooded fallow and paddy fields, wet wheat fields, irrigation storage ponds and canals, sewage ponds, and dry floodplains.<ref name=delHoyo/><ref name=Hancock/><ref name=Gopi2004>{{cite journal|author=Sundar, K.

==Behaviour and ecology==
This large stork has a dance-like display. A pair stalk up to each other face to face, extending their wings and fluttering the wing tips rapidly and advancing their heads until the meet. They then clatter their bills and walk away. The display lasts for a minute and may be repeated several times.<ref name=Hume>{{cite book|pages=265<U+2013>268| title= The nests and eggs of Indian birds|author=Hume, AO|edition=2|volume=2|year=1890|publisher= R H Porter, London|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/nestseggsofindia03humerich#page/265/mode/1up/search/Xenorhynchus}}</ref>

Nest building commences during the peak of the monsoon with most of the nests initiated during September - November, with few new nests built afterward until January. They nest in large and isolated trees on which they build a platform. The nest is large, as much as 3 to 6 feet across and made up of sticks, branches and lined with rushes, water-plants and sometimes with a mud plaster on the edges. Nests may be reused year after year. The usual clutch is four eggs which are dull white in colour and broad oval in shape, but varies from 1-5 eggs.<ref name=whistler>{{cite book|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/popularhandbooko033226mbp#page/n550/mode/1up |author=Whistler, Hugh|year=1949|title=Popular handbook of Indian birds|pages=502<U+2013>503|edition=4| publisher=Gurney and Jackson, London}}</ref><ref name=Hume/> The exact incubation period is not known but is expected to be about 30 days. Adult birds take turns at the nest and when one returns to relieve the other, they perform a greeting display with open wings and an up and down movement of the head.<ref name=kahl/> Food is brought for the young chicks by the adults and regurgitated onto the nest platform.<ref name=hbk/> Adults stop feeding the young at the nest after they are about 3 or 4 months old after which the adults tend to be aggressive. The young birds stay on nearby for about a year but disperse soon. Typically 1-3 chicks fledge from successful nests, but up to four chicks are fledged in years with unusually high rainfall.<ref name=Gopi2003/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Sundar, K.S.G. & Deomurari, A. & Bhatia, Y. & Narayanan, S.P.|year=2007|title=Records of Black-necked Stork ''Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus'' breeding pairs fledging four chicks|url=http://www.orientalbirdclub.org/publications/forktail/23pdfs/Sundar-Black-neckedStork.pdf|journal=Forktail|volume=23|pages=161<U+2013>163}}</ref>

==Status and conservation==
The Black-necked Stork is widely scattered and nowhere found in high densities, making it difficult for populations to be reliably estimated. The Sri Lankan population has been estimated to be about 50 birds while the species has become very rare in Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia. The may have become extinct in the Sundaic region. The combined South and Southeast Asian population is placed at about 1000 birds. The Australian population has been optimistically estimated at about 20,000 birds while a more conservative estimate suggests about 10,000 birds. They are threatened by habitat destruction, the draining of shallow wetlands, overfishing, pollution, collision with electricity wires and hunting.<ref name=Gopi2005/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Clancy, G.P.|year=2010| title=Causes of mortality in the Black-necked Stork ''Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus australis'' in New South Wales|journal=Australian Field Ornithology| volume=27|pages=65<U+2013>75}}</ref> Exceedingly few breeding populations with high breeding success are known.<ref name=Gopi2003/> It is evaluated as "Near Threatened" on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=iucn/>

The Mir Shikars, traditional bird hunters of Bihar in India had a ritual practice that required a young man to capture a Black-necked Stork "Loha Sarang" alive before he could marry. A procession would locate a bird and the bridegroom-to-be would try to catch the bird with a [[birdlime|limed]] stick. The cornered bird was a ferocious adversary. The ritual was stopped in the 1920s after a young man was killed in the process.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Grubh BR & PB Shekar|year=1968| title=Blacknecked Stork (''Xenorhynchus asiaticus'') and the marriage of Mirshikars|journal=Newsletter for Birdwatchers| volume=8| issue=3|pages=1<U+2013>2|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/NLBW9#page/n2/mode/1up}}</ref> Young birds have been known to be taken from the nest for meat in Assam.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Barman,R; Talukdar,BK |year=1996| title= Nesting of Blacknecked Stork ''Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus'' in Panidihing, Assam| journal= Newsletter for Birdwatchers|volume=36| issue=5|page=95.|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/NLBW36_5#page/n12/mode/1up/}}</ref>

In Australia, an aboriginal [[creation myth]] describes the origin of the bill of the "jabiru" from a spear that went through the head of a bird.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/movie/Emu-and-the-Jabiru/|title=Emu and the Jabiru|publisher=Australian Museum|accessdate = 11 June 2010}}</ref> The Binbinga people often consider the meat of the bird as taboo and eating its meat would cause an unborn child to cause the death of its mother. The Jabiru is known as "Karinji" and is the [[totem]] of a group known as the Karinji people.<ref>{{cite book|title=The northern tribes of central Australia|author=Spencer, Baldwin & F J Gillen|year=1904|publisher=Macmillan and co, London|pages=197, 614|url=http://www.archive.org/details/northerntribesc01gillgoog}}</ref>

The difference in iris colour among the sexes was noted in 1865 by [[Abraham Dee Bartlett|A D Bartlett]], the superintendent in charge of the collection at the Zoological Society of London. The similarity in this aspect with the African Saddle-billed Stork was noted by Bartlett and commented on by J. H. Gurney.<ref>{{cite journal|pages=263<U+2013>276|title=A seventh additional list of birds from Natal|author=Gurney, J H|journal=The Ibis|volume=7|year=1865|issue=3}}</ref> Charles Darwin who corresponded with Bartlett was well aware of this and used it as one of the examples of sexual dimorphism among birds.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/descentofmansele02darw#page/128/mode/1up|page=129|author=Darwin, C|year= 1871|title=The descent of man and selection in relation to sex|volume=2|publisher=John Murray, London}}</ref> John Gould in his handbook to the birds of Australia noted that the meat of the bird "... has a fishy flavour, too over-powerful to admit of its being eaten by any one but a hungry explorer."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/handbooktobirds01goulgoog#page/n308/mode/1up|page=293|title=Handbook to the birds of Australia|author=Gould, J|volume=2|year=1865|publisher=Published by the author}}</ref>
