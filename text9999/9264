The '''Toronto Raptors 2006<U+2013>07 season''' is the twelfth [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) season for the [[Toronto Raptors]] basketball [[professional sports league organization|franchise]]. Following a poor [[2005-06 NBA season|2005<U+2013>06 season]], [[General Manager]] [[Bryan Colangelo]] greatly revamped the team roster during the pre-season but continued to build the team around [[All-Star]] [[Chris Bosh]]. Despite a sluggish start, the [[2006-07 NBA season|2006<U+2013>07 season]] transformed into a [[Wiktionary:watershed|watershed]] year for Toronto. The Raptors captured their first [[Atlantic Division (NBA)|division]] title, finished third in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], made the [[NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] for the first time in five years, equalled their best ever regular season record, and secured home court advantage for the first time in franchise history. However, the Raptors met the [[New Jersey Nets]] in the first round of [[2007 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] and were defeated four games to two. At the end of the regular season, head coach [[Sam Mitchell (basketball)|Sam Mitchell]] and Colangelo were named [[NBA Coach of the Year]] and [[NBA Executive of the Year Award|NBA Executive of the Year]] respectively.

===Pre-season trades===
Before the season, Toronto won the [[NBA Draft Lottery]] and were awarded the [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|1st overall pick]] in the [[2006 NBA Draft]]. To prepare for their draft choice, the Raptors traded [[Rafael Paulo de Lara Ara<U+00FA>jo|Rafael Araujo]] for [[Kris Humphries]] and [[Robert Whaley]],<ref>[http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/pressrelease_trade_060806.html "Raptors Acquire Kris Humphries & Robert Whaley for Araujo"], nba.com/raptors, 8 June 2006, accessed 9 August 2007.</ref> and traded [[Matt Bonner]], [[Eric Williams (basketball, born 1972)|Eric Williams]] and a second round pick for [[Rasho Nesterovi<U+010D>]] and cash considerations.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/pressrelease_062106.html "Raptors Acquire Rasho Nesterovi<U+010D> In Exchange for Matt Bonner, Eric Williams & a Future Second Round Pick"], nba.com/raptors, 21 June 2006, accessed 12 April 2007.</ref> The 1st overall pick was used to select Italian [[Andrea Bargnani]], making him the first European drafted number one overall.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/andrea_bargnani/bio.html Andrea Bargnani Info Page], nba.com, accessed 9 August 2007.</ref> [[Maurizio Gherardini]] was hired as the club<U+2019>s vice-president and assistant general manager, making him the first European elevated to an NBA executive job.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/pressrelease_062206.html "Raptors Name Gherardini To Basketball Staff"], nba.com/raptors, 22 June 2006, accessed 21 April 2007.</ref> Promising small forward [[Charlie Villanueva]] was traded for point guard [[T. J. Ford]] and cash considerations,<ref>[http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/ford_charlie_060701.html "Raptors Pick Up Ford for Villanueva"], nba.com/raptors, 1 July 2006, accessed 9 August 2007.</ref> while [[Chris Bosh]] was rewarded with a three-year extension.<ref>Ewing, Lori, [http://www.cbc.ca/cp/sports/060714/s0714102.html "Toronto Raptors re-sign star forward Chris Bosh to contract extension"], cbc.ca, 14 July 2006, accessed 21 April 2007.</ref>

==Regular season==
[[General Manager]] [[Bryan Colangelo]] continued to surround Bosh with complementary players, and signed two-time [[Euroleague]] [[Most Valuable Player]] [[Anthony Parker]].<ref>[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/anthony_parker/bio.html Anthony Parker Info Page], nba.com, accessed 25 April 2007.</ref> [[Spain national basketball team|Spanish international]] [[Jorge Garbajosa]] and former [[Slam Dunk Contest|slam dunk]] champion [[Fred Jones (basketball)|Fred Jones]] were also signed from [[free agent|free agency]]. The Raptors concluded pre-season transactions by re-signing veteran [[Darrick Martin]]. With this new lineup, Toronto looked to maintain a team who could both pass and shoot the ball, but was also stronger defensively than the [[2005-06 NBA season|2005<U+2013>06]] roster.<ref name="rebirth">Smalls, Anthony, [http://www.nba.com/aroundtheassociation/raptors_revival.html "The Rebirth of the Raptors"], nba.com, 12 April 2007, accessed 25 April 2007.</ref> As a showcase of their new roster, on 15 October 2006, the 119 [[point (basketball)|points]] by Toronto marked the third highest total in a pre-season game in franchise history.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/notes_101506.html Post-Game Notes], nba.com/raptors, 15 October 2006, accessed 9 August 2007.</ref> The Raptors finished the pre-season with a 7<U+2013>1 win-loss record, which was the best record in the league and a franchise record.<ref>[http://www.vividseats.com/nba/toronto-raptors-tickets.html Toronto Raptors Season Update], vividseats.com, accessed 25 April 2007.</ref>

===Push for playoffs===
The first half of the season produced mixed results as Toronto struggled towards the .500 mark after a dismal 2<U+2013>8 start.<ref name="rebirth" /> Bosh's consistent performances however ensured he was named an [[All-Star]] starter in the [[2007 NBA All-Star Game]] on 25 January 2007.

After the break, Colangelo traded Jones for [[Juan Dixon]], a versatile guard.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/PR__dixon_022107.html "Raptors Acquire Juan Dixon in Exchange for Fred Jones"], nba.com/raptors, 21 February 2007, accessed 21 April 2007.</ref> [[Luke Jackson (basketball)|Luke Jackson]] was also signed to provide depth to Toronto's bench.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/jacksoncp_041407.html Raptors Sign Jackson], nba.com/raptors, 14 April 2007, accessed 6 June 2007.</ref> Following a win against the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] on 1 April 2007, Toronto clinched a playoff berth for the first time in five years.<ref>Ulmer, Mike, [http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/ulmer_040107.html "Raptors Clinch Playoff Spot"], nba.com/raptors, 5 April 2007, accessed 21 April 2007.</ref> They then claimed their first division title when they defeated the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] five days later, winning the [[Atlantic Division (NBA)|Atlantic Division]] crown.<ref>Grange, Michael, [http://www.globesports.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070406.wspt-raps-early 06/GSStory/GlobeSportsBasketball/home "Raptors claim first division crown"], globesports.com, 6 April 2007, accessed 25 April 2007.</ref> Another franchise record was set when Toronto won the next game against the Bulls, this time for most home wins.<ref>Christie, James, [http://www.globesports.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070408.wspt-raptors-bulls08/GSStory/GlobeSportsBasketball/home "Raptors keep charging along"], globesports.com, 8 April 2007, accessed 25 April 2007.</ref>

==Playoffs==
As third seed, the Raptors played sixth seed [[New Jersey Nets]] in the first round of the [[2007 NBA Playoffs]]. The series drew much media attention as [[Vince Carter]], a former Raptor who left Toronto under acrimonious circumstances two seasons ago, was now back at the ACC as a Net.<ref name=gameone>[http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/postup_042107.html Raptors Post Up], nba.com/raptors, 21 April 2007, accessed 26 April 2007.</ref> In the opening game, while Carter was constantly booed by the home crowd and was not an offensive threat, Toronto's inexperience was evident as they too struggled offensively and were down 65<U+2013>78 going into the fourth quarter.<ref name=gameone/> A late rally by Toronto in the fourth quarter was not enough as they eventually lost 91<U+2013>96. The Raptors won game 2 89<U+2013>83 at the ACC to tie the series 1<U+2013>1, as Bosh recorded 25 points and a game-high 13 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]].<ref>Grange, Michael, [http://www.globesports.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070424.wsptraptors24/GSStory/GlobeSportsBasketball/home "Back to square one as Raptors even the series"], globesports.com, 24 April 2007, accessed 25 April 2007.</ref> The Nets won games 3 and 4 to lead 3<U+2013>1, but Toronto forced a game 6 when they narrowly won 98<U+2013>96 in game 5.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/postup_050107.html Raptors Post Up], nba.com/raptors, 1 May 2007, accessed 2 May 2007.</ref> In that game, the Raptors set two post-season franchise records: most number of points going into halftime and biggest lead for a half.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/notes_050107.html Post-Game Notes], nba.com/raptors, 1 May 2007, accessed 2 May 2007.</ref> The attendance for the game was also a franchise record for a playoff game.<ref>Blair, Jeff, "Raptors stave off elimination", ''The Globe and Mail'', 1 May 2007.</ref> In game 6, however, New Jersey won 98<U+2013>97, sealing the series 4<U+2013>2 and sending Toronto out of the first round.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/postup_050407.html Raptors Post Up], nba.com/raptors, 4 May 2007, accessed 21 June 2007.</ref>
