'''New York State Route&nbsp;28B''' ('''NY&nbsp;28B''') was a [[state highway]] in [[Oneida County, New York]], in the United States. The route served as a connector between [[New York State Route 287 (1930<U+2013>1970)|NY&nbsp;287]] (now [[New York State Route 365|NY&nbsp;365]]) in the village of [[Prospect, New York|Prospect]] and [[New York State Route 12|NY&nbsp;12]] and [[New York State Route 28|NY&nbsp;28]] in the [[Remsen (village), New York|village of Remsen]]. It was assigned in the mid-1930s and removed in the mid-1960s, at which time most of the route became '''New York State Route&nbsp;920V''', an unsigned [[reference route (New York)|reference route]]. The alignment of NY&nbsp;28B was originally part of [[legislative route|legislative]] Route&nbsp;26 and later Route&nbsp;25 in the early 20th century.

==Route description==
NY&nbsp;28B began at an intersection with [[New York State Route 287 (1930<U+2013>1970)|NY&nbsp;287]] (now mostly part of [[New York State Route 365|NY&nbsp;365]]) at Church Street in the village of [[Prospect, New York|Prospect]]. The route headed to the northwest, following State Street through the northern portion of the village. At the northern village line, the amount of development along the route decreased substantially as it proceeded through the town of [[Trenton, New York|Trenton]] as Prospect Road. NY&nbsp;28B continued northwest for {{convert|1|mi|1}} on a linear northwesterly routing through a rural section of Trenton to the northern town line, where it crossed into the [[Remsen (town), New York|town of Remsen]]. The route continued on this path for another {{convert|0.25|mi|2}} before turning towards the west and paralleling the town line into the [[Remsen (village), New York|village of Remsen]].<ref name="1965map" /><ref name="yahoo">{{yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=43.315595&lon=-75.172215&zoom=15&q1=43.304487%2C-75.152278&q2=43.323987%2C-75.16496&q3=43.324174%2C-75.192168 |title=overview map of former NY 28B |accessdate=June 4, 2010}}</ref>

Within Remsen, NY&nbsp;28B became known as Prospect Street as it headed westward for three blocks through the residential southeastern part of the village. In the last of the three, the route crossed over Cincinnati Creek just before intersecting Main Street. While Prospect Street ended here, NY&nbsp;28B turned south onto Main Street, following it for two blocks to a junction with Steuben Street. Here, NY&nbsp;28B turned west, passing through a slightly more rural area as it approached the [[divided highway]] carrying [[New York State Route 12|NY&nbsp;12]] and [[New York State Route 28|NY&nbsp;28]] around the western edge of the village. NY&nbsp;28B ended upon meeting the arterial at the western village line.<ref name="1965map" /><ref name="yahoo" />

In 1908, the [[New York State Legislature]] created Route&nbsp;26, an unsigned [[legislative route]] extending from [[Little Falls (city), New York|Little Falls]] to [[Remsen (village), New York|Remsen]] via [[Dolgeville, New York|Dolgeville]], [[Salisbury, Herkimer County, New York|Salisbury]], and [[Prospect, New York|Prospect]]. In Remsen, Route&nbsp;26 ended at Route&nbsp;25, which followed the modern [[New York State Route 12|NY&nbsp;12]] corridor between [[Barneveld, New York|Barneveld]] and Remsen.<ref name="1909book">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jZ0AAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA62 |author=State of New York Department of Highways |title=The Highway Law  |year=1909 |publisher=J.

The section of legislative Route&nbsp;25 from Prospect to Remsen was finally assigned a posted designation ca. 1936 when it became part of NY&nbsp;28B, an alternate route of [[New York State Route 28|NY&nbsp;28]] that extended west along NY&nbsp;287 to Barneveld. At the time, NY&nbsp;12 and NY&nbsp;28 followed Mappa Avenue, Old State Road, and Main Street between Barneveld and Remsen while NY&nbsp;287 and NY&nbsp;28B were routed on Boon Street, Parker Hollow Road, and Church Street from Barneveld to Prospect.<ref name="1935map">{{cite map |title=Road Map & Historical Guide <U+2013> New York |publisher=[[Sun Oil Company]] |year=1935 |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]]}}</ref><ref name="1936map">{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Standard Oil Company]] |year=1936 |cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref> The overlap with NY&nbsp;287 was eliminated in the early 1950s after NY&nbsp;28B was truncated to begin in Prospect.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Socony-Vacuum Oil Company]] |cartography=Rand McNally and Company |year=1950}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Sunoco]] |cartography=Rand McNally and Company |year=1952}}</ref>

By 1954, NY&nbsp;12 and NY&nbsp;28 were shifted westward onto a new bypass around the village of Remsen. NY&nbsp;28B was extended southward along NY&nbsp;12 and NY&nbsp;28's former alignment on Main Street and westward on Steuben Street to meet the new highway.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York with Special Maps of Putnam<U+2013>Rockland<U+2013>Westchester Counties and Finger Lakes Region |publisher=Esso |cartography=General Drafting |edition=1955<U+2013>56 |year=1954}}</ref> The NY&nbsp;28B designation was eliminated in the mid-1960s<ref name="1965map">{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Mobil]] |cartography=Rand McNally and Company |year=1965}}</ref><ref name="1968map">{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Esso]] |year=1968 |edition=1969<U+2013>70 |cartography=General Drafting}}</ref> and replaced with NY&nbsp;920V, an unsigned [[reference route (New York)|reference route]].<ref name="2009log">{{cite book |url=https://www.nysdot.gov/divisions/operating/oom/transportation-systems/repository/2009%20tour-bk.pdf |format=PDF |title=Official Description of Highway Touring Routes, Bicycling Touring Routes, Scenic Byways, & Commemorative/Memorial Designations in New York State |author=New York State Department of Transportation |month=January |year=2009 |accessdate=July 16, 2009}}</ref> Around the same time, NY&nbsp;287 was realigned onto the bypass that now carries [[New York State Route 365|NY&nbsp;365]] around the northern fringe of the village of Prospect, truncating NY&nbsp;920V to its current length.<ref name="1965map" /><ref name="1968map" />
