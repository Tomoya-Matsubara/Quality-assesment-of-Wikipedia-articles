'''''Fa<U+00E7>ade''''' is a series of poems by [[Edith Sitwell]], best known as part of ''Fa<U+00E7>ade <U+2013> An Entertainment'' in which the poems are recited over an instrumental accompaniment by [[William Walton]]. The poems and the music exist in several versions.

Sitwell began to publish some of the ''Fa<U+00E7>ade'' poems in 1918, in the literary magazine ''Wheels''. In 1922 many of them were given an orchestral accompaniment by Walton, Sitwell's prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>. The "entertainment" was first performed in public in 1923, and achieved both fame and notoriety for its unconventional form. Walton arranged two suites of his music for full orchestra. When [[Frederick Ashton]] made a ballet of ''Fa<U+00E7>ade'' in 1931, Sitwell did not wish her poems to be part of it, and the orchestral suites were used.

After Sitwell's death, Walton published supplementary versions of ''Fa<U+00E7>ade'' for speaker and small ensemble using numbers dropped between the premiere and the publication of the full score in 1951.

==Versions==
''Fa<U+00E7>ade'' exists in several strongly contrasted versions, principally:
*Edith Sitwell's ''Fa<U+00E7>ade and Other Poems, 1920<U+2013>1935'' <U+2013> the published versions of those of the poems chosen by the author for her 1950 volume of collected verse.
*The Sitwell-Walton ''Fa<U+00E7>ade'' (1951) <U+2013> the first, and definitive published version of the full score of the entertainment
*''Fa<U+00E7>ade Revived'' (1977) <U+2013> a set of eight poems and settings not included in the 1951 version, published by Walton to mark his 75th birthday
*''Fa<U+00E7>ade II'' (1979) <U+2013> a revised version of ''Fa<U+00E7>ade Revived'', with some numbers dropped and others added
*''Fa<U+00E7>ade <U+2013> the complete version, 1922<U+2013>1928'' <U+2013> a  42-number CD set compiled and performed by Pamela Hunter (1993) restoring all the poems that Walton set, and nine that he did not set.
*Walton's orchestral ''Fa<U+00E7>ade Suites'' (1926 and 1938)

==Sitwell's published ''Fa<U+00E7>ade'' poems==
It is sometimes said that the ''Fa<U+00E7>ade'' verses are nonsense poetry, in the tradition of [[Edward Lear]]. This, however, is incorrect; despite the experiments with sound and rhythm, there is meaning in Sitwell's poems. The literary scholar [[Jack Lindsay]] wrote, "The associations are often glancing and rapid in the extreme, but the total effect comes from a highly organized basis of sense."<ref>Sitwell, introduction, p. 18</ref> Other writers have detected personal references in the ''Fa<U+00E7>ade'' poems. Christopher Palmer lists many references to Sitwell's unhappy childhood, from the kind Mariner Man (her father's valet who entertained her with sea-faring stories) to the implacable Mrs Behemoth (her mother).<ref name=chan>Palmer, Christopher (1990). Liner notes to Chandos CD CHAN 6689</ref>

The ''Fa<U+00E7>ade'' poems published by Sitwell in her 1950 collection, ''Fa<U+00E7>ade and other Poems, 1920<U+2013>1935'' are:

==The Sitwell-Walton ''Fa<U+00E7>ade <U+2013> An Entertainment''==
The "entertainment" ''Fa<U+00E7>ade'', in which Sitwell's poems are recited over an instrumental accompaniment by Walton, was first given privately in the Sitwell family's London house on 24 January 1922. The first public performance was given at the Aeolian Hall, London, on 12 June 1923. On both occasions, the author recited the verse and the composer conducted the ensemble.<ref name=k304>Kennedy, p. 304</ref>

Walton made changes to the instrumentation for the entertainment between its premiere and the publication of the first printed score nearly thirty years later,<ref name=k304/> but in both 1922-23 and 1951 he scored for six players, some doubling on different instruments. The published score specifies [[flute]], [[piccolo]], [[clarinet]], bass clarinet, [[trumpet]], percussion, and [[cello]].<ref name=score>Walton, ''passim''</ref> Walton quotes a range of earlier composers in his score, from [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] (the ''[[William Tell (opera)|William Tell]]'' overture appears in the Swiss Jodelling Song) to [[George Grossmith]] (whose comic song, "See me dance the polka", is present throughout Walton's Polka).<ref>See Kennedy, p. 112: Rossini was Walton's favourite composer, and is quoted in later Walton pieces also.</ref> 

In the Sitwell-Walton ''Fa<U+00E7>ade'' there are three poems, "Through Gilded Trellises," "A Man from a far Country" (from Sitwell's ''The Sleeping Beauty),'' and "Tarantella" (never formally published by Sitwell), that do not feature in her published edition of ''Fa<U+00E7>ade''. As the performing version frequently recited in public and recorded for the gramophone by Sitwell included the Tarantella, it may be assumed that she did not require the musical version to adhere strictly to the text of the published poems.

The public premiere of the entertainment was a ''succ<U+00E8>s de scandale''.<ref name=k33>Kennedy, p. 33</ref> The work consisted of Sitwell's verses, which she recited through a megaphone protruding through a decorated screen, while Walton conducted an ensemble of six players in his accompanying music.<ref name=k33/> The press was generally condemnatory. One contemporary headline read: "Drivel That They Paid to Hear".<ref name=chan/> ''[[The Daily Express]]'' loathed the work, but admitted that it was naggingly memorable.<ref>"Poetry Through a Megaphone", ''The Daily Express'', 13 June 1923, p. 7</ref> ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'' wrote of "relentless cacophony".<ref>"Futuristic Music and Poetry", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 13 June 1923, p. 3</ref> ''[[The Observer]]'' condemned the verses and dismissed Walton's music as "harmless".<ref>"Music of the Week", ''The Observer'', 17 June 1923, p. 10</ref> In ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', Dent was much more appreciative: "The audience was at first inclined to treat the whole thing as an absurd joke, but there is always a surprisingly serious element in Miss Sitwell's poetry and Mr Walton's music <U+2026> which soon induced the audience to listen with breathless attention."<ref>"The World of Music", ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 23 June 1923, p. 1122</ref> In ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', [[Ernest Newman]] said of Walton, "as a musical joker he is a jewel of the first water".<ref>Kennedy, p. 31</ref> Among the audience were [[Evelyn Waugh]], [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[No<U+00EB>l Coward]]. The last was so outraged by the avant-garde nature of Sitwell's verses and the staging, that he marched out ostentatiously during the performance.<ref>Hoare, p. 120. Soon afterwards Coward wrote a revue sketch lampooning the Sitwells, which caused a feud between him and them that lasted for decades.</ref> The players did not like the work: the clarinettist asked the composer, "Mr Walton, has a clarinet player ever done you an injury?"<ref>Kennedy, p. 33</ref> Nevertheless, the work soon became accepted, and within a decade Walton's music was used for the popular ''Fa<U+00E7>ade'' ballet, choreographed by [[Frederick Ashton]].<ref>Kennedy, p. 62</ref>

Walton revised the music continually between its first performance and the first publication of the full score in 1951. That definitive version of the Sitwell-Walton ''Fa<U+00E7>ade'' consists of:
{{col-begin}}

==Walton's later additions==
In the 1970s, Walton released some further numbers, under the title ''Fa<U+00E7>ade Revived'', later revising, dropping and adding numbers, as ''Fa<U+00E7>ade'' II''. 

''Fa<U+00E7>ade Revived'' comprises:
*Daphne
*Came the Great Popinjay
*The Last Gallop
*The Octogenarian
*March (Ratatatan)
*The White Owl
*Aubade <U+2013> Jane, Jane
*Said King Pompey
The work was premiered at the [[Worshipful Company of Plaisterers|Plaisterers' Hall]], London on 25 March 1977, with [[Richard Baker]] as reciter and the English Bach Festival Ensemble conducted by [[Charles Mackerras]].<ref>"''Fa<U+00E7>ade Revived''", ''[[The Times]]'', 19 March 1977, p. 9</ref>

''Fa<U+00E7>ade II'' comprises:
*Came the Great Popinjay
*Aubade <U+2013> Jane, Jane
*March (Ratatatan)
*Madam Mouse Trots

*Said King Pompey
This version was premiered at the [[Aldeburgh Festival]] on 19 June 1979, with [[Peter Pears]] as reciter and an ensemble conducted by [[Steuart Bedford]].<ref> Kennedy, p. 305</ref>

==Complete 1922<U+2013>1928 version==
When the most comprehensive edition of the Sitwell-Walton versions was released in 1993 (on a CD featuring the voice of the ''Fa<U+00E7>ade'' specialist Pamela Hunter with the Melologos ensemble) the number of poems had risen to 42. Pamela Hunter recites all these poems on the 1993 CD, including the nine for which there are no extant musical accompaniments.

==Three Songs==
Walton set three selections from ''Fa<U+00E7>ade'' as art-songs for soprano and piano, to be sung at full voice rather than spoken rhythmically. These are:
* Daphne
* Through Gilded Trellises
* Old Sir Faulk

==''Fa<U+00E7>ade'' Suites==
The first of Walton's two ''Fa<U+00E7>ade'' suites for full orchestra was published in 1926. Walton conducted the first performance. The suite consists of:
*Polka
*Waltz
*Swiss Jodelling Song
*Tango-Pasodoble
*Tarantella Sevillana<ref name=k300>Kennedy, p. 300</ref>

The second suite was premiered in 1938, with [[John Barbirolli]] conducting the [[New York Philharmonic]]. It consists of: 
*Fanfare
*Scotch Rhapsody
*Country Dance
*Noche Espagnole
*Popular Song
*Old Sir Faulk <U+2013> Foxtrot<ref name=k300/>

The orchestra for both comprises 2 flutes, piccolo, 2 [[oboes]], [[cor anglais]], 2 clarinets, 2 [[bassoons]], 4 [[horns]], 2 trumpets, [[trombone]], [[tuba]], [[timpani]], 3 percussionists ([[side drum]], [[cymbals]], [[xylophone]], [[tambourine]], [[bass drum]], [[triangle (instrument)|triangle]], [[glockenspiel]], [[castanets]], [[rattle (percussion)|rattle]]), and strings.

==''Fa<U+00E7>ade'' ballets==
''Fa<U+00E7>ade'' was first made into a ballet by G<U+00FC>nter Hess for the German Chamber Dance Theatre in 1929. In 1931 [[Frederick Ashton]] created another ballet version. Both used the First ''Fa<U+00E7>ade'' Suite. For Ashton's version the Scotch Rhapsody and Popular Song were added to the First Suite. Ashton later expanded the ballet to include the Country Dance, Noche Espagnole and the Foxtrot, Old Sir Faulk.<ref name=k291>Kennedy, p. 291</ref>

In 1972, to mark Walton's seventieth birthday, Ashton created a new ballet using the score of the "entertainment". It was premiered at the Aldeburgh Festival, with Peter Pears as the reciter.<ref name=k291/>
