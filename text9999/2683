'''<nowiki>Wesley</nowiki> Branch Rickey, Jr.''' (January 31, 1914 &ndash; April 10, 1961) was an [[United States|American]] front office executive in [[Major League Baseball]]. The son of [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] club executive [[Branch Rickey]], who among his many achievements invented the [[farm system]] and led the movement within baseball to break the [[baseball color line|color line]], Branch Jr. <U+2014> called "The Twig" by many <U+2014> was a highly respected farm system director, but never led his own organization. He was the father of [[Branch Rickey III|Branch Barrett Rickey]], widely known as "Branch Rickey III," a longtime baseball executive and the current president of the [[Pacific Coast League]].

After graduating from [[Ohio Wesleyan University]], Branch Rickey Jr. entered baseball in [[1935 in baseball|1935]] as business manager of the [[Albany, Georgia]] ''Travelers'' of the Class D [[Georgia-Florida League]], one of the many farm clubs in his father's [[St. Louis Cardinals]] organization. In [[1939 in baseball|1939]], he joined the archrival [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] as farm director, recruited by the then-Brooklyn president, [[Larry MacPhail]]. However, in a strange turn of events, when MacPhail resigned at the end of the [[1942 in baseball|1942]] season to rejoin the armed forces, he was replaced by Branch Sr., who eventually became a co-owner of the Brooklyn club.

The younger Rickey then worked with his father as the Dodgers'  farm director, and, after [[1947 in baseball|1947]], assistant [[general manager]] until the end of the [[1950 in baseball|1950 season]], when [[Walter O'Malley]] acquired controlling interest in the team and forced Rickey Sr., his former partner, out of the Brooklyn organization.

Rickey Sr. then moved to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] as executive vice president and general manager, with Branch Jr. as the Pirates' vice president and farm system director. The younger Rickey held that post until his premature death in Pittsburgh at age 47 on April 10, 1961. He had long been troubled by [[diabetes]], and [[hepatitis]] and [[pneumonia]] were also factors in his passing.

Although the 1951-55 reign of Branch Sr. as GM of the Pirates has been widely viewed as a failure, he and Branch Jr. put into place the successful Pittsburgh organization of the 1960s and 1970s. Led by the great [[Roberto Clemente]], drafted by the Rickeys from the Dodgers, the Bucs won the [[1960 World Series]] and the [[1971 World Series]]. Pittsburgh contended through the rest of that decade, winning its last Series in [[1979 World Series|1979]].
