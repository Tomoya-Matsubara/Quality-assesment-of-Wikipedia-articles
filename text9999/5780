'''NSB Class 72''' ({{lang-no|NSB type 72}}) is a class of 36 [[electric multiple unit]]s built by [[AnsaldoBreda]] for the [[Norwegian State Railways]]. Delivered between 2002 and 2005, the four-car units operate on the [[Oslo Commuter Rail]] and the [[J<U+00E6>ren Commuter Rail]]. The trains have a capacity of 310 passengers and the {{convert|2250|kW}} motors allow a maximum speed of {{convert|160|km/h}}. The trians were ordered in 1997, with original delivery dates in 2001 and 2002. NSB also had an option to buy 40 additional units. The first units were not delivered until 2002, and by 2004, still half the trains were not in use. Faults included rust, too heavy train weight, and signaling problems.

==History==
By the mid-1990s, NSB was in need of new electric multiple units to supplement and replace the company's aging fleet of [[NSB Class 69|Class 69]] units.  At the time, NSB had 60 Class 69 units operating in the Oslo area, of which at any time four to eight were out of service.<ref>{{cite news |title=Departementet positiv til NSBs planer: Gr<U+00F8>nt lys for nye togsett |last=Width |first=Henrik |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=15 January 1997 |page=5 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In 1997, NSB stated that they intended to oder 36 new units, of which 18 would replace aging units and 18 would be used to increase services. This was seen as the first step in an order of 100 new EMUs that would be needed in the coming 20 years. The oder was part of a holistic ordering program through which NSB in the late 1990s ordered the [[NSB El 18|El 18]], [[NSB Di 6|Di 6]], the [[GMB Class 71|Class 71]], [[NSB Class 73|Class 73]] and [[NSB Class 93|Class 93]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Vil kj<U+00F8>pe 100 nye lokaltog |last=Thompson |first=Svein |work=[[Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv]] |date=15 January 1997 |page=5 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In August, NSB stated that there were three bidders for the local train class, which would consist of a firm order for 36 units with an option for another 20 units. The bidders were Ansaldo, [[Alstom|GEC Alstom]] and [[Adtranz]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Milliard-kamp om nye lokaltog |last=Holm |first=Per Annar |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=19 September 1997 |page=5 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> where Adtranz had the only bid which would involve construction in Norway.<ref name=fraitalia>{{cite news |title=Trikker og tog fra Italia |last=Bentzr<U+00F8>d |first=Sveinung Berg |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=27 September 1997 |page=2 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

On 26 September 1997, NSB announced that they would order 36 new trains from Ansaldo, with an option for an additional 40 units. Each train would cost 50&nbsp;million [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK), and NSB had 28 months to use their option. NSB's CEO, [[Osmund Ueland]], stated that Ansaldo had been chosen because they had the best technical offer and had by far the lowest price. The new trains would have 35% lower maintenance costs and use 33% less electricity than the Class 69. The new trains would also have a higher maximum speed, have wider doors and make less noise.<ref name=kjop>{{cite news |title=NSB kj<U+00F8>per 36 nye lokaltogsett i Italia |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=26 September 1997 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The electronics would be delivered by Ansaldo, the superstructure by [[Breda]] and the [[bogie]]s by [[Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works]] (SLM).<ref name=nekter>{{cite news |title=NSB nekter <U+00E5> ta imot nye togsett |last=Holm |first=Per Annar |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=5 February 2004 |page=2 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The estimated date of delivery for the trains was from 1 July 2000 to 1 July 2001.<ref name=fraitalia /> The exterior and interior design was made by [[Pininfarina]], with assistance from NSB's own designers. The latter were used to tailor the design to the Norwegian public's preferences, which among other things involved use of wood in the interior.<ref>{{cite news |title=NSBs nye supertog |last=Pedersen |first=Hugo |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=12 September 1998 |page=19 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>  At the time, Ansaldo also had an order for the [[Oslo Tramway]]'s [[SL95]].<ref name=kjop />

In 1999, NSB announced that they would be rebranding their services, and that commuter trains would be branded at [[NSB Puls]]. They would loose their traditional red color and instead be colored green and silver, with the Class 72 being the first trains to receive the new design.<ref>{{cite news |title=NSB fornyer seg med tre nye togtyper |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=22 April 1999 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In February 2001, the first train arrived to Norway for testing.<ref>{{cite news |title=Italiener p<U+00E5> sporet  |work=[[Teknisk Ukeblad]] |date=6 February 2001 |page=99 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The delay was caused by errors in the drawings and the bankruptcy of a supplier. In April it was announced that the trains were too heavy to allow standing passengers, since the trains could then exceed the permitted axle weight. To reduce the weight, the trains needed to have some steel parts replaced with aluminum. NSB stated that the situation was problematic both because they had calculated the need for standing places to handle rush-hour traffic, and because it was impossible for them to control if more people that there were seats for would board a train. NSB stated that part of the problem was that they could not order shelf ware, in part because the Norwegian [[loading gauge]] is wider than in [[Continental Europe]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Nye lokaltog sendes rett p<U+00E5> slankekur |last=Enghaug |first=P<U+00E5>l |last2=Hultgren |first2=John |last3=Tve<U+00F8>y |first3=Tone |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=22 April 2001 |page=3 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> By September, a solution had been found whereby the weight had been reduced sufficiently that 350 standing passengers could be taken on each train.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nye lokaltog snart ett <U+00E5>r forsinket: NSB har vektproblem |last=Holm |first=Annar |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=23 September 2001 |page=4 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The trains were delivered with train radio system [[Scanet]], but the technology was so out of date there was only a five-year warranty. At the time, it was uncertain when [[GSM-R|Global System for Mobile Communications <U+2013> Railway]] (GSM-R) would be built for the [[rail transport in Norway|Norwegian rail network]], and NSB feared there could arise a situation were the trains could not be used, if the construction was not accelerated.<ref>{{cite news |title=NSBs nye togradio holder bare fem <U+00E5>r |last=Enghaug |first=Paul |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=11 February 2002 |page=11 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

The first scheduled service with a Class 72 train occurred on 8 August 2002 on the J<U+00E6>ren Commuter Rail. NSB stated that they had never previously spent so much time testing equipment before putting it into service, and that the J<U+00E6>ren had been chosen for the introduction because the single-line system was easier to operate than the services around Oslo. The company also stated that they hoped all the trains would be in service by the end of 2003.<ref>{{cite news |title=To <U+00E5>rs ventetid over <U+2013> nye pendlertog p<U+00E5> vei til Oslo |last=B<U+00F8> |first=Trond |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=9 August 2002 |page=3|language=Norwegian}}</ref> By January 2003, half the trains had been delivered, and were gradually being put into service on the Oslo Commuter Rail. However, on the [[Gardermoen Line]] the electronics from the train were interfering with the signaling systems, so the lights would switch from green to red before the train passed, instead of afterwards. This made it impossible for the NSB to put the train into service on Norway's only high-speed line.<ref>{{cite news |title=R<U+00F8>dt lys for nye lokaltog |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=8 January 2003 |page=3 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Another problem was that the trains would not close the doors if they were at a station without level tracks, although this was quickly solved.<ref name=avporing>{{cite news |title=Italiensk avsporing |last=Ergo |first=Thomas |work=[[Dagbladet]] |date=15 February 2003 |page=28 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In 2003, NSB decided to abandon the Puls concept, and revert to the former single-profile strategy.<ref>{{cite news |title=NSB arbeider med en helt ny produktstrategi |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=26 March 2003 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

By February 2003, only five of the trains were in operation. Four were being used on the J<U+00E6>ren Commuter Rail, while one was being used on the line between [[Moss, Norway|Moss]] and [[Spikkestad]]. A few were still in Italy, a few at the docks in Drammen, while most of the trains were stored at Sundland in Drammen where AnsaldoBreda had 40 Italian engineers working 60-hour shifts to make the trains work. At the time they were finishing one train per month.<ref name=avporing /> By June, all seven trains had been taken into use in J<U+00E6>ren, and the first four trains could be put into service on the route from [[Kongsberg]] via the Gardermoen Line to [[Eidsvoll]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Nye lokaltog kommer to <U+00E5>r etter planen |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=13 June 2003 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In January 2004, rust was found on the axles of the trains. NSB would not accept to take delivery of the last 18 units before this problem had been fixed, and stated that no more money would be payed to the manufacturer until all 36 trains were delivered and without defects. By 2004, Ansaldo and Breda had merged to AnsaldoBreda, while SLM had been bought by [[Bombardier Transportation]]. The latter would not the deliver the axles to AnsaldoBreda because of a disagreement bewteen Bombardier and SLM's previous owner, [[Sultzer]], regarding who was to pay for the axles. This caused Bombardier to cease all work with the delivery from mid-2003.<ref name=nekter /> In October 2004, the trains were put into service on the route bewteen Moss and Spikkestad.<ref>{{cite news |title=Godt nytt for lokaltoget  |work=[[Dagbladet]] |date=14 October 2004 |page=7 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>
