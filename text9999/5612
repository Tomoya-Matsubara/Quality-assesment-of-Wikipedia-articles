Austin held nineteen championships throughout his professional wrestling career, and is recognized by WWE as a six-time [[World Heavyweight Championship (professional wrestling)|world champion]], having held the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] on [[List of WWE Champions|six]] occasions, and the fifth [[Triple Crown Championship|Triple Crown Champion]]. He was also the winner of the [[King of the Ring#1996|1996]] [[King of the Ring]] tournament, as well as the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|1997]], [[Royal Rumble (1998)|1998]] and [[Royal Rumble (2001)|2001]] [[Royal Rumble]]s. He was forced to retire from in ring competition in early 2003 due to a series of knee and neck injuries sustained throughout his career. Throughout the rest of 2003 and 2004, he was featured as the [[Professional wrestling authority figures#Raw brand authorities|Co-General Manager]] and "Sheriff" of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''. Since 2005, he has continued to make part-time appearances.

==Early Life==
Austin was born '''Steven James Anderson''' in [[Victoria, Texas]]. After his father left the family, his mother, Beverly, re-married to Ken Williams, and Austin adopted his stepfather's surname.<ref name="truth10"/> After attending [[Schaumburg High School]], Austin got a football scholarship at Wharton County Junior College, followed by a full scholarship at [[University of North Texas|North Texas State University]]. Austin played four full years of football, but dropped out of NTSU after his football eligibility ended because he was short of graduating and no longer desired to be in school.                                                                                                         

==Professional wrestling career==
===World Championship Wrestling (1991<U+2013>1995)===
{{Main|Dangerous Alliance|The Hollywood Blonds#Steve Austin and Brian Pillman|l2=Hollywood Blonds|Stud Stable}}
After some time, Austin decided to become a professional wrestler and enrolled at the wrestling school run by [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|Chris Adams]], whose school was run out of the [[Dallas Sportatorium]] where he was wrestling for [[World Class Championship Wrestling]]. Austin made his debut in World Class in 1989 under his real name, but was later given the name "Steve Austin" by Memphis-area booker [[Dutch Mantel]]. Austin's run in Memphis was part of the merger between World Class and the [[Continental Wrestling Association]] out of Memphis, with the combined company known as the [[United States Wrestling Association]]. Austin would eventually return to Dallas and feud with Adams, with [[William Moody|Percy Pringle]] and [[Jeannie Clark|Jeannie Adams]] (Adams' real-life former wife and Austin's girlfriend at the time) as his valets. It was during this time Austin adopted the "Stunning" nickname that followed him to WCW.

Austin left WCCW after its final folding in 1990 and signed with WCW the next year. He was originally paired with a valet named Vivacious Veronica,<ref name=truth86>[[#AustinRoss2003|Steve Austin. ''The Stone Cold Truth'']] (p.85-86)</ref> but was later joined by Jeannie Adams as "Lady Blossom". <ref name=slam>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/austin.html|title=Steve Austin Bio|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer|CANOE]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}</ref><ref name=truth86/> Austin defeated [[Bobby Eaton]] for the WCW World Television Championship on June 3, 1991, just weeks after his debut. In late 1991, Austin joined [[Paul Heyman|Paul E. Dangerously's]] [[Dangerous Alliance]].<ref name=slam/><ref>[[#AustinRoss2003|Steve Austin. ''The Stone Cold Truth'']] (p.89)</ref> Austin lost the WCW Television Championship to [[Barry Windham]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Series variations|two out of three falls match]] on April 27, 1992. He regained the title from Windham on May 23, 1992. Austin enjoyed a second lengthy reign before losing to [[Ricky Steamboat]] on September 2, 1992. The Dangerous Alliance disbanded shortly thereafter.<ref name=truth91>[[#AustinRoss2003|Steve Austin. ''The Stone Cold Truth'']] (p.91-93)</ref> At [[Halloween Havoc#1992|Halloween Havoc]], he replaced [[Terry Gordy]], teaming with "Dr. Death" Steve Williams to wrestle [[Dustin Rhodes]] and [[Barry Windham]] for the unified WCW and NWA World Tag Team title.<ref name=truth91/> The teams wrestled to a thirty minute time limit draw.<ref name=truth91/>

In January 1993, Austin formed a [[tag team]] with [[Brian Pillman]] known as [[The Hollywood Blonds]].<ref name=slam/> The Blonds won the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]] on March 3, 1993, defeating Ricky Steamboat and [[Shane Douglas]]. The Hollywood Blonds held the title for five months.<ref name=slam/> At ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XXIII|Clash of the Champions XXIII]]'' the Blonds faced [[Ric Flair]] and [[Arn Anderson]] in a two out of three falls tag Team title match. Flair and Anderson defeated the Blonds, but were not awarded the title as one fall had been determined by a disqualification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html#XXIII|title=Clash of the Champions XXIII results|accessdate=2008-07-15|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> At ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XXIV|Clash of the Champions XXIV]]'', Austin and Pillman were scheduled to defend the title against Anderson and [[Paul Roma]].

At [[Starrcade (1993)|Starrcade]], in a two out of 3 falls match, Austin defeated Dustin Rhodes in two straight falls to win the [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Championship]].<ref name=slam/> Austin lost the title to Ricky Steamboat on August 24, 1994. Austin was scheduled to face Steamboat in a rematch for the title at [[Fall Brawl#1994|Fall Brawl]], but Steamboat was unable to wrestle due to a back injury, and Austin was awarded the title by forfeit. His second reign ended just minutes later when he lost to Steamboat's replacement, [[Jim Duggan]] in a match that lasted thirty-five seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/fall.html#94|title=WCW Fall Brawl 1994 results|accessdate=2008-07-15|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> Austin unsuccessfully challenged Duggan for the United States Championship at [[Halloween Havoc#1994|Halloween Havoc 1994]] and ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XXIX|Clash of the Champions XXIX]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/havoc.html#94|title=WCW Halloween Havoc 1994 results|accessdate=2008-07-15|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html#XXIX|title=Clash of the Champions XXIX results|accessdate=2008-07-15|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> After returning from a knee injury in early 1995, Austin took part in a tournament for the vacant WCW United States Heavyweight title, where he defeated Duggan via count out in the first round, but lost to [[Randy Savage]] in the quarterfinals.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995)===
In 1995, Austin was fired by WCW Vice President [[Eric Bischoff]], after suffering a triceps injury, while wrestling on a Japanese tour; Bischoff and WCW did not see Austin as a 'marketable' wrestler.<ref name=slam/><ref>Stone Cold Steve Austin. ''The Stone Cold Truth'' (p.117<U+2013>118)</ref> Austin described his opinion on being fired over the phone as Eric Bishoff taking the [[coward]]'s way out.  Eventually, Austin was contacted by Paul Heyman of [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW), who had managed him in WCW.<ref name=slam/> Heyman hired Austin to do in-ring interviews, as he still had not recovered from his injury enough to wrestle.<ref name=cold120>Stone Cold Steve Austin. ''The Stone Cold Truth'' (p.120)</ref> While in ECW, Austin used the platform to develop his future "Stone Cold" persona as well as a series of vignettes running down WCW in general and Bischoff in particular.<ref name=slam/><ref name=cold120/>

While with ECW, Austin was known as "Superstar" Steve Austin.<ref name=cold123>Stone Cold Steve Austin. ''The Stone Cold Truth'' (p.123<U+2013>125)</ref> He had a match with [[Jim Fullington|The Sandman]] and feuded with [[Mikey Whipwreck]].<ref name=cold123/> Whipwreck, who was the [[ECW Championship|ECW World Heavyweight Champion]] at the time, defeated Austin at [[November to Remember#1995|November to Remember]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1995d.html#111895|title=ECW November to Remember 1995 results|accessdate=2008-07-15|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> The Sandman defeated Steve Austin and Whipwreck in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]] at [[December to Dismember (1995)|December to Dismember]] in 1995 for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1995d.html#120995|title=ECW December to Dismember 1995 results|accessdate=2008-07-15|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref>

===World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment (1995<U+2013>2010)===
====The Ringmaster (1995<U+2013>1996)====
{{Main|Million Dollar Corporation}}
In late 1995, Austin joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) after [[Kevin Nash]] and [[Jim Ross]] helped convince WWF's owner [[Vince McMahon]] to hire him.<ref name=slam/><ref name=cold123/> Initially, Austin wrestled as "The Ringmaster" and was managed by [[Ted DiBiase]],<ref name=slam/> who awarded him with the [[Million Dollar Championship]].<ref>Ted DiBiase: The Million Dollar Man, p.193, Ted DiBiase with Tom Caiazzo, Pocket Books, New York, NY, 2008, ISBN 978-1-4165-5890-3</ref> Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated [[Savio Vega]] at [[WrestleMania XII]].<ref>{{cite news|author=PWI Staff|title=Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts|work="Wrestling<U+2019>s historical cards"|pages=88}}</ref> During this time, Austin shaved his head bald. At [[In Your House 8: Beware of Dog|In Your House: Beware of Dog]], Austin lost a "Caribbean Strap match" to Vega. In accordance to the pre-match stipulations, DiBiase was forced to leave the WWF, giving Austin the opportunity to forge his own path.<ref name=almanac9598>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling<U+2019>s Historical Cards|pages=95<U+2013>98}}</ref> Austin later told announcer [[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Dok Hendrix]] (Michael P.S. Hayes) that he had purposely lost the match in order to rid himself of his manager.

====Austin 3:16 and rise to superstardom (1996<U+2013>1997)====
Austin's genuine rise to superstardom began at the [[King of the Ring#1996|1996 King of the Ring]]. Austin began using his trademark finishing maneuver, the Stone Cold Stunner; with this new technique, he won the King of the Ring tournament,<ref name=slam/> receiving a [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] originally intended for [[Triple H]], but taken away from him after an [[The Kliq#Curtain Call: The MSG Incident|incident the month before]]. After defeating [[Marc Mero]] in the semi-finals, Austin defeated [[Jake Roberts|Jake "The Snake" Roberts]] in the finals.<ref name=slam/><ref name=almanac9598/> At the time, Roberts was portraying a born-again Christian, so after the match, Austin cut a now famous [[List of professional wrestling terms#P|promo]] during his coronation, telling Roberts,<ref>Foley, Mick. ''Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks'' (p.229)</ref> ''"You sit there and you thump your Bible, and you say your prayers, and it didn't get you anywhere! Talk about your psalms, talk about [[John 3:16]]... Austin 3:16 says I just whooped your ass!"''. "Austin 3:16" ultimately became one of the most popular catch phrases in wrestling history.<ref name=slam/>
[[Image:Stone Cold Steve Austin in 1996.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Austin in 1996.]]
Austin spoke about [[Bret Hart]] constantly and taunted him relentlessly. Hart finally accepted Austin's challenge and returned to the WWF in October 1996. At [[Survivor Series (1996)|Survivor Series]], Hart pinned Austin in a match which helped create the foundations for the eventual intense year-long feud between the two.<ref name=almanac9598/> The match came hot on the heels of an incident broadcast live on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', which saw Austin "[[Brian Pillman#"Pillman's Got a Gun"|break into]]" Brian Pillman's house, with Pillman holding a gun. During the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|1997 Royal Rumble]] match, Austin was originally eliminated by Bret Hart, but the officials did not see it, and he snuck back into the ring and eliminated Hart by throwing him over the ropes, thus winning the match.<ref name="PS32">{{cite news|author=Martin, Finn|title=Power Slam Magazine, issue 32|work="Back on Top" (Royal Rumble 1997)|publisher=SW Publishing|date=1997-02-25|pages=12<U+2013>15}}</ref> This led to the first-ever [[pay-per-view]] main event of Austin's WWF career at [[In Your House 13: Final Four]], which due to real-life events largely revolving around [[Shawn Michaels]], the match was for the suddenly vacant [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]]. Austin was eliminated from the four-way match early after injuring his knee, but was involved in the finish which saw Hart win his fourth WWF Championship,<ref name=almanac9598/> which he lost the next night on ''Raw'' to [[Sid Eudy|Sycho Sid]] due to Austin's interference, leading to the continuation of their feud. At [[WrestleMania 13]], Hart defeated Austin in a 'Submission' match with [[Ken Shamrock]] as a special referee. During the match, Austin was cut so that he bled, and Hart refused to release his Sharpshooter since Austin had refused to give up. The match ended in Austin passing out due to blood loss. Despite his wounds he refused any assistance back to the locker room, thus turning Hart  [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] and Austin  [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] in a rare [[List of professional wrestling terms#T|double-turn]].<ref name=almanac9598/> Austin eventually got his revenge on Hart when he injured Hart's leg in a no disqualification match on ''Raw'', which featured Austin refusing to let go of his own Sharpshooter and beating Hart while on a stretcher in the back of an ambulance. Austin would face Hart once again in the main event of [[In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker]], which Austin won when Hart was disqualified due to assistance from [[Davey Boy Smith|The British Bulldog]]. After his feud with Hart, he faced [[The Undertaker]] for the WWF Championship at [[In Your House 15: A Cold Day in Hell|In Your House 15: A Cold Day In Hell]]. Austin had the Undertaker down with the Stunner, but due to a distraction from Brian Pillman, Undertaker nailed Austin with a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Tombstone piledriver|Tombstone Piledriver]] and achieved the victory.<ref name=almanac9598/>

During this time, Austin found a way to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] on two separate occasions. On May 25, 1997, Austin and [[Shawn Michaels]] defeated Owen Hart and The British Bulldog for the title. They held the title until July 14, before Michaels was forced to vacate due to an injury.<ref>http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/304454132122112</ref> That same night a tournament was held to determine who would face Austin and a partner of his choosing for the vacant championship. Hart and Bulldog won the tournament, with Austin refusing to pick a partner and choosing to wrestle the former tag team champions by himself.<ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com">http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/97.htm</ref> Late in the match, a debuting [[Mick Foley|Dude Love]] came out to offer assistance and Austin became a two-time tag team champion.<ref>http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/30445413212312</ref> Austin continued his feud with the Hart family, becoming embroiled in a heated rivalry with Bret Hart's brother, [[Owen Hart]].

At [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]], Austin and Hart faced each other with Hart's [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] on the line and an added stipulation that Austin would have to kiss Hart's [[buttocks]] if he lost.<ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"/> During the match Hart botched a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Texas piledriver|piledriver]] and dropped Austin on his head, resulting in a legitimate broken neck for Austin and temporary paralysis. As Hart stalled by baiting the audience, Austin managed to crawl and pin Hart using a [[Pin (professional wrestling)#Roll-up|roll-up]] to win the Intercontinental Championship. A visibly injured and dazed Austin was helped to his feet by a number of referees and led to the back. Due to the severity of his neck injury, Austin was forced to relinquish the Intercontinental title and the Tag Team titles. Austin was sidelined until [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]]. However, in the interim he made several appearances, one being at [[WWE Bad Blood|Bad Blood]] where he was involved in the finish of a match between Hart and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]], which was the final match in an Intercontinental Championship tournament. Austin hit Faarooq with the Intercontinental Championship belt while the referee's back was turned, causing Hart to win the match.<ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"/> Austin's motives were to keep the Intercontinental Championship around Hart's waist, and were proven when he interfered in Hart's matches on the October 20 and 27 editions of ''Raw''.<ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"/> Austin would regain the Intercontinental Championship from Hart at [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]].

With Hart out of the way, Austin set his sights on [[Dwayne Johnson|Rocky Maivia]], who stole Austin's belt on the November 17 edition of ''Raw'' after a beating by his [[Nation of Domination]] stablemates.<ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"/> In the weeks to come, Maivia began referring to himself as "The Rock" and declaring himself to be "the best damn Intercontinental Champion" ever.<ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"/> The Rock kept possession of the belt until [[D-Generation X: In Your House]], when Austin defeated him to retain the title and get his belt back. As Austin had used his pickup truck to aid in his victory, McMahon ordered him to defend the title against The Rock the next night on ''Raw''.<ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"/> In an act of defiance, Austin tossed the belt into a [[New Hampshire]] river, and McMahon subsequently stripped Austin of the title and awarded it to The Rock.<ref name="wwebio">{{cite web| url = http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/stonecoldsteveaustin/bio/|title = WWE Hall of Fame Inductees "Stone Cold" Steve Austin Biography| publisher =[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]| accessdate = 2009-05-26}}</ref>

====Feuding with Mr. McMahon (1997<U+2013>1999)====
On September 22, 1997, on the first ever ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' to be broadcast from [[Madison Square Garden]], Owen Hart was giving a speech to the fans in attendance. During his speech, Austin entered the ring with five NYPD officers following, and assaulted Hart. As if it looked Austin was going to fight the officers, Vince McMahon ran into the ring to lecture Austin about why he couldn't be "physically" able to compete. After telling McMahon that he respects the fact that he and the WWF cared, Austin attacked McMahon with a Stone Cold Stunner, leaving McMahon in shock. Austin was then arrested on charges of trespassing, assault, and assaulting a police officer. This marked the beginning of the Austin-McMahon rivalry.

With Bret Hart's departure, Austin and Shawn Michaels were the top superstars in the company. Austin won the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|1998 Royal Rumble]], lastly eliminating The Rock.<ref name=pwi100>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling<U+2019>s Historical Cards|pages=100}}</ref> The next night on ''Raw'', Austin interrupted Vince McMahon in his presentation of [[Mike Tyson]], who was making a special appearance, over the objection of McMahon referring to Tyson as "the baddest man on the planet." Austin flipped off Tyson, which led to Tyson shoving Austin much to McMahon's embarrassment, who began to publicly disapprove of the prospect of Austin as his champion. Tyson was later announced as "the special enforcer" for the main event at [[WrestleMania XIV]], although he appeared to be aligning himself with WWF Champion Shawn Michaels' stable [[D-Generation X]].<ref name=slam/><ref name="wmtyson">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Torch_Flashbacks_19/article_38025.shtml|title=Austin confronts Tyson, brawl breaks out|last=Keller|first=Wade|date=1998-01-24|publisher=PWTorch|accessdate=2010-01-11}}</ref> This led to Austin's WWF Championship match against Michaels at WrestleMania XIV, which he won with help from Tyson, who turned on DX by making the deciding three-count against Michaels, and later hit HBK with his knock-out punch. In fact Shawn Michaels had suffered two herniated discs and another completely crushed at the hands of the Undertaker in a 'casket match' in the previous PPV, many have cited this nearly fatal injury of Michaels to be an other reason to why he lost the championship to Austin at WrestleMania XIV.<ref name=slam/> This victory ushered in the Austin Era,<ref name=slam/> and with it, [[The Attitude Era]].<ref name=pwi100/>
[[Image:Austinentrance.jpg|right|thumb|"Stone Cold" Steve Austin's signature ring entrance.]]
On the ''Raw'' after Austin won the WWF Title, Vince McMahon presented him with a new title belt and warned Austin that he did not approve of his rebellious nature and that things could be done "the easy way or the hard way." Austin gave his answer in the form of another Stunner. This led to a segment a week later where Austin had pledged a few days prior in a meeting to "play ball" with McMahon, appearing in a suit and tie, with a beaming McMahon taking a picture of himself and his new corporate champion. The entire thing was a ruse by Austin who in the course of the segment proceeded to tear off the suit, tell McMahon it was the last time he would see Austin dressed like this, punch his boss in the "corporate grapefruits," and take another picture of the two of them while McMahon was doubled over in pain. In April 1998, it appeared Austin and McMahon were going to battle out their differences in an actual match, but the match was declared a [[Professional wrestling#No contest|no contest]] when [[Mick Foley|Dude Love]] made an appearance. This led to a match between Love and Austin at Unforgiven: In Your House, where Austin hit McMahon with a steel chair then the following month they had a rematch at [[Over the Edge: In Your House]] for the WWF Championship. Austin managed to retain the title despite McMahon acting as the referee and his "Corporate Stooges" ([[Gerald Brisco]] and [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]]) as timekeeper and ring announcer, respectively.

McMahon continued to do everything he could to ruin Austin, and he finally scored a big victory for his side at the [[King of the Ring (1998)|1998 King of the Ring tournament]].<ref name=slam/> There, Austin lost the WWF Championship to [[Glenn Jacobs|Kane]] in a First Blood match.<ref name=slam/> Austin further infuriated McMahon by winning back the championship the next night on ''Raw''.<ref name=slam/> Austin also emerged victorious against The Undertaker at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]]. In response, McMahon set up a Triple Threat match at [[Breakdown: In Your House]], where The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin at the same time. McMahon decided to vacate the WWF Championship<ref name=slam/> and award it based on a match between the Undertaker and Kane, in which Austin was the guest referee. Austin refused to count for either man and attacked both towards the end of the match. McMahon later fired him, although Austin got revenge by kidnapping McMahon and dragging him to the middle of the ring at "gunpoint," which ended up being a toy gun with a scroll that read "Bang! 3:16." Also the segment was very "embarrassing" to McMahon as it showed he was so scared that he urinated his pants. Stone Cold was later re-signed by [[Shane McMahon]]. In the semifinals of a tournament to award the vacant championship, Austin lost to Mankind, after Shane double-crossed Austin. The next night on ''Raw'', [[Mills Lane|Judge Mills Lane]] ruled that The Rock had to defend his newly won WWF Championship against Austin that night. The Undertaker interfered and hit Austin with a shovel, earning Austin a disqualification victory. At [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]], Steve Austin defeated The Undertaker in a Buried Alive match after Kane Tombstoned The Undertaker into the grave. With this victory, Austin qualified for the [[Royal Rumble (1999)|1999 Royal Rumble]].

Austin's next definitive chance to exact revenge on Mr. McMahon came during the 1999 Royal Rumble match. On ''Raw'', McMahon drew Austin's entry number with the obvious intention of screwing him over. Austin drew entry number one, while McMahon drew number two thanks to WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels. During the Rumble match, McMahon slipped out of the ring and into the crowd as Austin chased him down. It turned out to be a trap as McMahon led Austin into the lobby restroom where he was ambushed by members of [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]]. Austin was injured and taken away in an ambulance. With Austin gone and not in the Rumble match, McMahon joined the announce table in calling the match. Later on, however, Austin returned in an ambulance and re-entered the Royal Rumble,  delivering a Stunner to the [[Ray Traylor|Big Boss Man]] and eliminating him. With the assistance of the Corporation and a last minute interference from The Rock, Austin was eliminated by McMahon himself, and McMahon won the 1999 Royal Rumble.<ref name=slam/> With McMahon turning down his number-one contender spot against The Rock, WWF Commissioner Michaels awarded Austin the title shot during ''Raw'' the next night. At [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House|St. Valentine's Day Massacre]], Stone Cold got a one-on-one match against McMahon in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|Steel Cage match]], with the WWF Championship opportunity at [[WrestleMania XV]] at stake.<ref name=slam/> During the match, [[Paul Wight]] made his debut, breaking through from under the ring and attacking Austin. Wight's attack propelled Austin into the side of the cage forcing the cage to give way and dropping Austin to the floor first, making him the victor.<ref name=slam/> Austin defeated The Rock at [[WrestleMania XV]] for his third WWF Championship.<ref name=slam/>

Austin faced The Rock in a rematch at [[WWE Backlash#1999|Backlash]], in which Shane McMahon was the referee. During the match, McMahon approached the ring, only to hand Austin back his Smoking Skull belt and take Shane out of the proceedings. Austin won the match when another referee made the count. The Undertaker, however, won the WWF Championship from Austin at [[Over the Edge (1999)|Over the Edge]]. Due to events revolving around Vince McMahon, [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie]] and [[Linda McMahon]] made Stone Cold the Chief Executive Officer of the company. Vince and Shane McMahon challenged Austin to a Handicap [[Ladder match]] at [[King of the Ring#1999|King of the Ring]] with the CEO title on the line, which the duo of father and son won. The next night on ''Raw'', however, Austin made it clear that while he was the CEO of the company, he could have a title shot at any time and place to be determined by himself. Austin made the WWF Championship match that night on ''Raw'' and defeated The Undertaker to win his fourth WWF Championship. However, after he won it, the Undertaker came and hit him with the Championship belt, leading to a first blood match at [[WWF_Fully_Loaded#1999|Fully Loaded]] where Mr McMahon made the rule if Austin lost he would never be able to wrestle for the WWF Championship again, and if Austin won, he would never see McMahon again. Austin won after hitting the Undertaker (with the help of x pac distracting undertaker) with a TV camera and gave McMahon a goodbye Stone Cold stunner. Austin held on to the Championship belt until [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]] when he lost it to Mankind in a Triple Threat match also featuring [[Triple H]].<ref name=slam/> Austin would get his rematch at [[No Mercy (1999)|No Mercy]] against Triple H but lost after [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] accidentally struck him with a sledgehammer that was meant for Triple H. By [[Survivor Series (1999)|Survivor Series]], Triple H was still champion. Austin was booked into a triple threat match for the WWF Championship that also included Triple H and The Rock. Instead, however, Austin was run down by a car in the parking lot.<ref name=slam/> [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]] would replace Austin in the match and would win the WWF Championship. What followed was neck surgery by Dr. [[Lloyd Youngblood]] and a nine-month rehabilitation with the car angle as his reason for leaving.<ref name=slam/> In reality, Austin had needed neck surgery since the Owen Hart incident in 1997.<ref name=slam/>

==== Return and Heel Turn (2000<U+2013>2001)====
{{Main|The Power Trip}}
At [[WWE Backlash#2000|Backlash]], Austin attacked Triple H and Vince McMahon, helping The Rock reclaim the WWF Championship. At [[WWE Unforgiven#2000|Unforgiven]], Austin made his official return and tried to find out who ran him down at Survivor Series the previous year.<ref name=slam/> [[Solofa Fatu|Rikishi]] finally admitted to being the driver because "he did it for the people."<ref name=slam/> At [[WWE No Mercy#2000|No Mercy]], Austin was back to face Rikishi in a No Holds Barred Match. During the match, Austin motioned he was going to drive his truck into Rikishi, who by that time was a bloody mess. Before he could, he was stopped by officials and the match was deemed a no contest and Austin was (kayfabe) arrested and later bailed by Commissioner [[Mick Foley]]. During a handicap match against Rikishi and [[Kurt Angle]], Triple H came down with the apparent intention of teaming with Austin. After clearing the ring, Triple H smashed his sledgehammer over Austin's head, and revealed it was actually him behind the whole scheme, devised to shield the WWF Championship from Austin and end his career. At [[Survivor Series (2000)|Survivor Series]], Triple H had plotted to run Austin down again during their match (thus repeating the events of the previous year's Survivor Series) but his plot failed when Austin lifted Triple H's automobile with a forklift, then let it drop 20 feet.

Austin won his third [[Royal Rumble (2001)|Royal Rumble]] in January 2001,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010128/ai_n9605892|title=Stone Cold rumbles to Houston aiming to sell out Astrodome|author=Blackjack Brown|publisher=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=2007-12-06|date=2001-01-28}}</ref> last eliminating Kane. His rivalry against Triple H ended at [[No Way Out (2001)|No Way Out]] in a Three Stages of Hell match, with Triple H beating Austin two falls to one. Then, at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]], Austin turned  [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] by hitting The Rock with a steel chair several times to win the WWF Championship.<ref name=slam/> After the match, Austin shook hands and shared a beer with Vince McMahon. With the victory, Austin became a five-time WWF Champion. The next night on ''Raw'', after teasing a quick face turn, the heel turn continued. He also altered his character considerably over the next few months, in a deliberate turn from the rebellious and anti-establishment character beloved by the fans, Austin became a whiny, temperamental prima donna who would complain incessantly when he felt he was not getting the respect from the fans and wrestlers that he deserved. He also developed an infatuation with McMahon, going to great lengths to impress him and even going so far as to hugging him and bringing him presents. McMahon, though visibly uncomfortable and wary by the attention, was still grateful to have Austin with him instead of against him. During a cage match with The Rock in a rematch for the title, Triple H came down to the ring with a sledgehammer and together with Austin viciously attacked The Rock and put him out of action. Austin further cemented his heel turn the following Thursday on Smackdown! when, during an interview with [[Jim Ross]] about his actions at WrestleMania, thought Ross was denouncing their friendship and then proceeded to attack and brutally assault Ross. Austin and Triple H became a team and called themselves [[The Power Trip|The Two-Man Power Trip]].<ref name=slam/>

Austin and Triple H were the top heels in the company feuding with The Undertaker and Kane. After defeating Kane and The Undertaker for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] at [[WWE Backlash#2001|Backlash]], they held the Tag Team Titles, the WWF Championship (Austin), and the WWF Intercontinental Championship (Triple H) all at once. At [[Judgment Day (2001)|Judgment Day]], Triple H lost his Intercontinental Title against Kane. Then, the following night on ''Raw'', Austin and Triple H wrestled against [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Chris Benoit]] with the Tag Team Titles on the line. Midway through the match, Triple H tore his quadriceps muscle.<ref name=slam/> As planned, the team lost the Tag Team Title at the end of the match when Triple H accidentally hit Austin in the stomach with a sledgehammer, but the injury to Triple H, which kept him out for the remainder of the year, forced the WWF to go in another direction. Austin had a minor injury for a month.

====The Invasion (2001)====
{{See also|The Invasion (professional wrestling)|l1=The Invasion}}
Austin was paired with Kurt Angle and feuded against Jericho and Benoit. This culminated with a Triple Threat match at [[King of the Ring#2001|King of the Ring]], in which Austin faced the former tag team champions. Although WCW's [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]] interfered, Austin scored the victory and retained his championship. The feud ended at that point, as Benoit had neck surgery after the match, sidelining him for the following year.

In July 2001, with Benoit out for surgery, the Austin/Jericho feud was dropped without a mention. With the Rock still away making movies, the WWF desperately rushed out the plans for [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]]. As The Invasion storyline began and progressed, McMahon was watching helplessly as his empire was crumbling around him due to [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]] luring more and more talent away from the WWF, and his biggest allies, Austin and Angle, too busy sucking up to him and bickering amongst themselves to successfully counter the Alliance. Austin made it known that he was against teaming with Angle, whom Austin saw as both a threat to his title, as well as an annoying tag along. A frustrated McMahon appealed to Austin to return to his old Texas Rattlesnake persona, even imploring him to give him a Stone Cold Stunner. Though intending to fire up Austin, it backfired and only seemed to hurt his feelings, as he promptly left the arena, dejected. But the week before [[WWF Invasion|InVasion]], the old Stone Cold Steve Austin "returned," delivering stunners to the Alliance members. This was all part of the setup for a swerve at the event, where Austin betrayed the WWF team and partner Angle to help the Alliance win, as Austin assumed leadership of the group.<ref name=slam/> The reason why Austin did this was because he felt that McMahon was grooming Angle to take over his spot, and that he was "unappreciated" when McMahon insisted he return to the old Austin.

Austin lost and regained his title in a feud with Angle, who was put over by Austin as a threat. Austin lost the title to Angle at [[WWE Unforgiven#2001|Unforgiven]] before regaining it on the October 8, 2001 episode of ''Raw''.<ref name=slam/> In a swerve, Angle joined the Alliance just before [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]].<ref name=slam/> As the Invasion angle dragged on, it was ultimately decided to bring the plot line to an end with Austin and a group of ECW and WCW wrestlers facing The Rock and a group of WWF wrestlers at the Survivor Series.  Austin and his team lost after Angle betrayed him, thus ending the Invasion angle. The next night on Raw, as McMahon was about to award Angle with the WWF Championship for actions at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]], Ric Flair came out and announced that he owned half of the WWF. Austin came out and attacked Angle and McMahon, thus regaining the WWF Championship. Austin then had a beer bash with Flair, turning Austin face once again. Austin would hold the WWF Championship for another month before losing it to Chris Jericho at [[Vengeance (2001)|Vengeance]] due to interference from Booker T. Jericho defeated both The Rock and Austin consecutively that night, winning the WCW World Title and later the WWF Title and combining them to create the [[WWE Championship|WWF Undisputed Championship]]. After that, Austin continued another feud with Booker T. In one angle, Austin defeated Booker T in an unofficial grocery store fight.

====Backstage issues and departure (2002<U+2013>2004)====
By 2002, Austin's spot as top face in the WWF was not secure as it had been. In the 2002 Royal  Rumble, Triple H was set to make his long awaited return from injury, with he and Austin 2 of the last 4 participants in the ring along with Kurt Angle and [[Mr Perfect]]. Austin was eliminated by Kurt Angle, however he shortly went back in the ring and hit all the last 3 with a steel chair. A few days later on ''Raw'' he defeated Kurt Angle to earn a WWF Undisputed title shot against Chris Jericho at ''[[No Way Out 2002]]'', where the re-signed [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] started a feud with him after Austin refused a beer gift. At ''[[WrestleMania X8]]'', Austin defeated [[Scott Hall]] instead. In a surprise altercation the next night on ''Raw'', Austin refused to show up and took a week long break without the companies consent, claiming exhaustion.

Austin returned on the April 1, 2002 episode of ''Raw'', the first of the new "[[WWE Brand Extension|brand extension]]" era. The show was centered on which show he would sign with, and he ultimately chose Raw. Austin entered a feud with the Undertaker that resulted in a number one contenders match for the WWF Undisputed Championship at [[Backlash (2002)|Backlash]], which Austin lost despite having his foot on the rope. He would later be betrayed by Big Show, who went on to rejoin the nWo, and Ric Flair. Austin then defeated Big Show and Flair in a handicap match at [[WWE Judgment Day#2002|Judgment Day]]. Bored and run down, Austin began to create problems backstage. In an interview on WWE television by telephone, Austin criticised the direction the company was heading in and slated the creative team for not using him the way he felt they should have. McMahon responded a week later on the same show claiming that Austin was the type of wrestler who was occasionally difficult to work with. The WWF rehired [[Eddie Guerrero]] for Austin to feud with, whilst also prepping Austin for a feud with [[Brock Lesnar]]. Austin, however, vetoed any matches that would result in him losing and ultimately walked out of the company when the writing staff wanted Austin to lose to Lesnar.<ref name=trip/> Austin later explained that he thought hot-shotting a victory did no favors to either side, as it made Austin look weak losing to a rookie and did not give Lesnar a proper stage for such a big win over a star of the magnitude that Austin held. Further fanning the flames amongst Austin's growing number of detractors was a well-publicized domestic dispute incident between Austin and his wife Debra.<ref name=trip/> Austin's last appearance was on June 3, when he defeated Flair in a match where Flair became Austin's servant. After Austin [[List of professional wrestling terms#N|no-showed]] an episode of ''Raw'', the angle was dropped.<ref name=trip>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCO/is_3_4/ai_91561860|title=Austin's power trip|author=Alex Gordon|publisher=Wrestling Digest|accessdate=2007-12-06|date=October 2002}}</ref> Austin had decided to walk out again because of bad storylines that were presented to him by the creative team.<ref name=trip/>  The commentators, including long time Austin supporter Jim Ross, buried Austin on WWE programming, referring to the situation as Austin "taking his ball and going home" because he wasn't getting his way.  This period was also documented in an episode of [[WWE Confidential]].  

[[Image:Rockaustinxix.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Austin faces off against [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] at [[WrestleMania XIX]] in Austin's last match.]]
In February 2003, Austin returned to WWE at [[No Way Out (2003)|No Way Out]] in a short match against Eric Bischoff. Austin would wrestle only one match between then and WrestleMania in another short match against Bischoff on ''Raw'', but was then defeated by The Rock at [[WrestleMania XIX]], who returned about the same time as a smug, "sell out" villain, which, ultimately, became Austin's last official match in WWE. The night after on ''Raw'', Bischoff "fired" Austin on medical grounds. Austin then gave an interview with wwe.com the next morning confessing that the medical problems read out on ''Raw'' were real and had been seriously plaguing him since late 2001, and was wrestling against the advice of his doctors up to his departure in 2002 which forced him to quit wrestling. He announced deep regret over the situation that led to his departure and the way in which he'd left, and deeper regret over inaccurate speculation regarding his alleged grudges held against other WWE wrestlers, claiming he had no problems with Kevin Nash or Scott Hall rejoining the company, but did confess he had problems with HHH's role in the company upon his return, but insisted as of 2003 they resolved, and that none of his disputes with the wrestlers continued or played the major part in his departure.

He was brought back by Linda McMahon as the Co-General Manager of Raw. The move to the role of Co-General Manager was a way to keep Austin on-camera while limiting Austin's in-ring performance due to the long running injuries wearing him down throughout his career. On the November 17, 2003 edition of ''Raw'', Austin was "fired" from Raw as the result of a stipulation in a match at [[Survivor Series (2003)|Survivor Series]] where Austin's hand-picked team of wrestlers failed to beat Bischoff's team of wrestlers. Austin quickly returned to WWE television before the end of 2003 when he was part of the [[WWE Tribute to the Troops#2003|WWE Tribute to the Troops]] taped live in front of U.S. troops in [[Iraq]], posing and stunning Mr. McMahon. He finally came back on ''Raw'' on December 29 as its "Sheriff", giving a Stone Cold Stunner to Eric Bischoff and rehiring Shawn Michaels, who had just been "fired" by Bischoff.

Austin appeared on and off as 2004 began, culminating in him being the special guest referee for the infamous match between Brock Lesnar and [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] at [[WrestleMania XX]]. Then, on April 17, WWE put out a press release on their website claiming that Steve Austin and WWE were unable to settle long-running contract disputes and had again parted ways.

====Part-time appearances (2005-present)====
Austin made his first appearance on WWE programming in a year at [[WrestleMania 21]] where he was confronted by "Rowdy" [[Roddy Piper]] in ''[[Piper's Pit]]'' until [[Carly Col<U+00F3>n|Carlito]] interrupted to insult both. This resulted in Carlito receiving a [[Stunner (professional wrestling)|Stone Cold Stunner]] from Austin and Piper throwing him out of the ring. The segment ended with Austin and Piper celebrating with beer until Austin gave Piper a Stone Cold Stunner as well. He then appeared on the following nights Raw.

At [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]] Austin came to the ring following the show's main event.  Wearing a [[Las Vegas Outlaws]] (of the failed [[XFL]]) jersey, Austin came to the ring to give [[Jim Fullington|The Sandman]] a beer which he had asked for.  However, Austin invited the whole locker room to the ring for a Beer Bash.  However, before the bash he demanded the WWE Crusaders come to the ring for a fight. [[Tazz]] came to the ring, which started the brawl. After Taz applied the [[Kata ha jime|Tazmission]] to [[Kurt Angle]] the brawl ended.  ECW stood alone in the ring after throwing all of the Crusaders out of the ring. [[Mick Foley]] (as Cactus Jack) then dragged [[Eric Bischoff]] to the ring.  The [[Dudley Boyz]] gave him a [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Death Drop|Dudley Death Drop]], followed by [[Chris Benoit]] giving him a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques|Diving Headbutt]], [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.|Rey Mysterio]] followed that with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Tiger feint kick|619]].  When Austin then asked Bischoff about his feelings on the night, he responded with "Fuck ECW", which promoted Austin to give Bischoff a stunner.  As the Dudley Boyz took Bischoff outside, and loaded him onto a WWE production truck, the remaining ECW Originals took place in a "beer bash" as the show went off the air. He was on Raw the following night.

Then, at ''[[WWE Raw#Special episodes|WWE Homecoming]]'', Austin again returned to ''Raw'', delivering Stunners to all four members of the McMahon family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/051003.html|title=Raw results - October 3, 2005|accessdate=2007-05-25|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> An angle including [[Jim Ross]] being fired led to a match in which Austin agreed to face Ross's replacement, [[Jonathan Coachman]], at [[Taboo Tuesday (2005)|Taboo Tuesday]], with the stipulation of Ross regaining his announcing job if Austin were to win and Austin losing his own job if he lost the match. Austin balked at the decision for Coachman to win, however, and once again walked out on the company after storyline disagreements. To explain away his failure to appear at Taboo Tuesday, Vince McMahon said on ''Raw'' that Austin had been involved in an accident, thus preventing him from competing. [[Dave Batista|Batista]] substituted for Austin defeating the Coach along with [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] and [[Dustin Rhodes|Goldust]]. The stipulation was dropped due to Austin not competing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/november/taboo2005.htm|title=Taboo Tuesday 2005 Results|accessdate=2007-09-17|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref>

Austin returned to WWE briefly to face [[John Layfield|John "Bradshaw" Layfield]] in a beer drinking contest at the March 5, 2006 edition of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]''. Austin won by disqualification as he saw JBL cheating by pouring the beer down his clothes. Austin gave a stunner to JBL and then celebrated with the Stone Cold beer salute. Austin then inducted Bret Hart into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] on April 1, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/austin.html|title="Stone Cold" Steve Austin|accessdate=2008-10-25|publisher=slam.canoe.ca}}</ref>

Austin returned to WWE programming (appearing on ''Raw'', ''[[ECW (WWE)|ECW]]'', and ''SmackDown!'') in March 2007, partially to promote his starring role in the release of WWE Films' production, ''[[The Condemned]]''. On March 31, 2007, Austin inducted his friend Jim Ross into the WWE Hall of Fame. At [[WrestleMania 23]], Austin, as a [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|special guest referee]], officiated the match between [[Bobby Lashley]] and [[Eddie Fatu|Umaga]]. The stipulation for the match was that if Lashley lost, Donald Trump's head would be shaved, and if Umaga lost, Mr. McMahon's head would suffer the same fate. In the course of the event, Austin delivered stunners to Umaga, Vince McMahon, Shane McMahon, and [[Donald Trump]] Lashley eventually won the match, and Trump, Austin and Lashley then shaved Mr.McMahon's head on live TV. Stone Cold ended by stunning McMahon as well as Donald Trump and toasting beers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/march/xxiii.htm|title=WrestleMania 23 Results|accessdate=2007-09-17|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> He then appeared in a video on the June 11 edition of ''Raw'' as part of "Mr. McMahon's Appreciation Night", where he shared his thoughts on his past feuds with McMahon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/070611.html|title=Raw results - June 11, 2007|accessdate=2007-10-22|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>

[[File:Austin at Cyber Sunday 2008 crop.jpg|thumb|right|Austin would often referee matches after retiring from wrestling]]
Austin appeared on the August 18, 2007 edition of ''Saturday Night's Main Event'', as a possible illegitimate child of Mr. McMahon and stunned McMahon and Jonathan Coachman. Austin appeared at [[SummerSlam (2007)|SummerSlam]] where he was the replacement for [[Matt Hardy]] to battle [[Montel Vontavious Porter]] in a Beer Drinking Contest. The match ended in a no contest after Austin handed a beer to MVP and gave him the Stone Cold Stunner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/august/2007.htm|title=SummerSlam 2007 Results|accessdate=2007-10-22|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> Austin made another appearance at Cyber Sunday (2007), where he guest refereed a World Heavyweight Championship match between the champion Batista, and the challenger The Undertaker. Batista walked out the champion after delivering a Batista Bomb to The Undertaker.On the November 5, 2007 edition of ''Raw'', Austin made an appearance to confront [[Santino Marella]] for criticizing ''[[The Condemned]]''.<ref name="beer bath">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/11052007/articles/stonecoldsantino|title=<U+2018>Stone Cold<U+2019> drops a box-office bomb on Santino|date=2007-11-05|author=Corey Clayton|accessdate=2007-12-31|publisher=WWE}}</ref> The argument ended as Marella received a Stone Cold Stunner from Austin, who then walked backstage only to return with a [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] beer truck to hose down Marella and his valet [[Maria Kanellis|Maria]] with beer.<ref name="beer bath"/> On December 10, 2007 during the ''[[WWE Raw#Special episodes|Raw 15th Anniversary Spectacular]]'', Austin returned after Vince McMahon received the [[mandible claw]] from [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] and a [[chokeslam]] from The Undertaker for proclaiming himself "the greatest Raw superstar of all time." Shortly after, McMahon received a Stone Cold Stunner as Austin called out all WWE stars in attendance to the ring to celebrate the 15th anniversary of Raw. The show closed as Austin, Triple H and [[Hornswoggle]] poured beer on McMahon, who was knocked out outside the ring.

On October 26, 2008, at [[Cyber Sunday (2008)|Cyber Sunday]], Austin was the special guest referee during a match between Batista and Chris Jericho for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]. In between the match Stone Cold told a fleeing Jericho that if he was counted out or disqualified, Batista would win the title. During the course of the match, Batista accidentally knocked Austin down. When Austin recovered, Randy Orton, who had come out as the third referee, knocked Austin back down, only to receive a Stone Cold Stunner when Austin recovered. Eventually Batista won the match by hitting his signature Batista Bomb on Chris Jericho, leading Austin to give the three count, making Batista the new World Heavyweight Champion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/cybersunday/matches/7880726/results/|title=Stunnin' New Champion|accessdate=2008-10-26|publisher=WWE}}</ref>

On January 12, 2009, edition of ''Raw'', Austin was announced to be the first member of the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/articles/9109986|title=One and only "Hall-Raiser"|accessdate=2009-02-15|publisher=WWE}}</ref> He was inducted by his long-term on-screen rival Vince McMahon, who referred to Austin as "The Greatest WWE Superstar of all time." During the induction, there were "''one more match''" chants, to which Austin said he was officially closing the door on his wrestling career and starting a new chapter in his life. At [[WrestleMania XXV]], Austin was introduced alongside the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2009. After the introductions, Austin's theme music hit, and he re-entered the ringside area wearing a vintage "Austin 3:16" shirt driving an ATV. He then enjoyed his trademark beer bash with the fans.

Austin returned to the company on the March 15, 2010 episode of [[WWE Raw|Raw]] as its [[List of WWE Raw guest hosts|guest host]]. On that episode of ''Raw'' he moderated a contract signing between [[Vince McMahon]] and [[Bret Hart]] for their match at [[WrestleMania XXVI]]. In the same episode Austin met up backstage with his long time rival [[Shawn Michaels]], who asked Austin whether he believed that Michaels could end the Undertaker's undefeated Wrestlemania streak in their upcoming match. Austin replied that he believed Michaels could beat the Undertaker, but that he wouldn't be able to do so at Wrestlemania. Michaels lost the match extending the Undertaker's streak to 18-0 and forcing Michaels to retire.

On the 900th episode of "Raw" which took place on August 30th of 2010 the intro and theme for Stone Cold Steve Austin were shown. However, this was only a trick by fellow wrestler CM Punk who was attempting to prove a point about what the Straight Edge Society believed was a disturbing history of the WWE. Steve Austin did not actually make an appearance on this night.

==Television and film career==
Austin filmed guest roles on ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]'' and ''[[Nash Bridges]]'', where he played Detective Jake Cage. His motion picture debut was in a supporting role as Guard Dunham in the 2005 remake of ''[[The Longest Yard (2005 film)|The Longest Yard]]''. Austin had his first starring film role, as Jack Conrad, a dangerous convict awaiting execution in a [[El Salvador|Salvadoran]] prison, who takes part in a illegal [[deathmatch]] game that is being broadcast to the public in the 2007 [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] ''[[The Condemned]]''. In 2010, Austin appeared in the film ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'' as Dan Paine, the bodyguard and right hand man for the primary antagonist of the film. This role featured Austin working alongside other action stars such as [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Jason Statham]], [[Jet Li]], and [[Randy Couture]].
