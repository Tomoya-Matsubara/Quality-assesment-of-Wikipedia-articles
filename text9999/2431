The '''J<U+00E6>ren Commuter Rail''' ({{lang-no|NSB Lokaltog J<U+00E6>ren}}, previously {{lang|no|''J<U+00E6>rbanen''}}) is a [[commuter train]] service operated along the western-most part of the [[S<U+00F8>rland Line]] in [[J<U+00E6>ren]], [[Norway]]. It is operated by [[Norwegian State Railways]] (NSB) with [[NSB Class 72|Class 72]] [[electric multiple unit]]s. The service acts as a commuter rail connecting [[Stavanger]] to its suburbs and to towns further south. Although passenger services have operated along the lines since 1878, the commuter train was created with an increase of service with existing rolling stock in 1992. The system has an annual ridership of 2.5 million passengers.

The services from [[Stavanger Station]] to [[Egersund Station]], a distance of {{convert|75|km|sp=us}}. The service has four hourly services from Stavanger to [[Sandnes Station]], of which two continue to [[N<U+00E6>rb<U+00F8> Station]] and one to Egersund. The section from Stavanger to Sandnes is [[double track]], while the rest is [[single track (rail)|single track]]. The infrastructure is owned by the [[Norwegian National Rail Administration]] and the line is also used by intercity and freight trains. The system is proposed upgraded with a branch along the [[<U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Line]], a branch to [[Stavanger Airport, Sola]] and double track from Sandnes to Egersund.

Class 69 is a series of 88 two and three-car electric multiple units built by [[Str<U+00F8>mmens V<U+00E6>rksted]] between 1970 and 1993. A motor car has a power output of {{convert|1188|kW}}, allowing a speed of {{convert|130|km/h|sp=us}}. Each car is {{convert|24.85|m|sp=us}} long, with motor cars weighing {{convert|64.0|to|53.9|t|lk=on}} and end cars weighing down to {{convert|28.8|t}}. Typical seating capacity is 96 passengers in the motor cars and 112 passengers in the end cars.<ref name="Aspenberg 2001: 170">Aspenberg (2001): 170</ref> The class was delivered in four versions, named A through D. After the initial delivery of fifteen 69As in 1970 and 1971, twenty 69Bs were delivered in 1974 and 1975. These were designed to operate on longer sections and were equipped with only one door per car. This turned out to extend stopping time too much, and the C and D versions were delivered with two doors per car. From 1975 to 1977, NSB took delivery of fourteen 69Cs and from 1983 to 1993 thirty-nine 69Ds. The latter is distinguishable because of its different front. NSB operates both two- and three-car sets, and up to three units can be run in multiple, allowing NSB to operate any train length from two to nine cars.<ref>Aspenberg (2001): 170<U+2013>177</ref> Eighty-two units remain in service, although some of those are used on the [[Bergen Commuter Rail]] and the [[Arendal Line]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nsb.no/fakta-om-vaare-tog/type-69-arbeidshesten-article24523-2714.html |title=Type 69 - "Arbeidshesten" |publisher=[[Norwegian State Railways]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=7 May 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5pYDMW0b3 |archivedate=7 May 2010}}</ref>

The J<U+00E6>ren Line opened as a narrow gauge railway between Stavanger and Egersund on 1 March 1878. The railway was extended from Egersund to Flekkefjord on 1 November 1904 as the [[Flekkefjord Line]]. On 21 December 1924, the J<U+00E6>ren Line's only branch opened, the <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Line from Ganddal to <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd.<ref>Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009b): 44</ref> On 1 March 1944, the J<U+00E6>ren Line became part of the S<U+00F8>rland Line, when the line opened between [[Sira]] and [[Kristiansand]].<ref>Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009b): 45</ref> The S<U+00F8>rland Line from Egersund to Stavanger was opened as electric on 3 June 1956.<ref>Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009b): 34</ref> This resulted in [[NSB Class 65|Class 65]] and [[NSB Class 68|Class 67]] electric multiple units being used on local trains on the line.<ref>Aspenberg (2001): 139</ref> In 1960, the services were replaced by [[NSB Class 68|Class 68]] units.<ref>Aspenberg (2001): 157</ref> The section from Stavanger to Sandnes became the first part of the [[rail transport in Norway|Norwegian railway network]], after the [[Ofoten Line]], to centrally controlled. The [[centralized traffic control]] opened from Stavanger to Sandnes on 20 March 1964, and from Sandnes to Egersund on 7 July.<ref>Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009b): 37</ref> The whole line received partial [[automatic train control]] on 31 December 1986.<ref>Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009b): 40</ref>

The commuter rail system was introduced from 1 January 1992, after an agreement between NSB, [[Rogaland County Municipality]] and the six municipalities along the line. NSB introduced new Class 69 multiple units, while the county municipality introduced a fare coordination with the corresponding bus services.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bedre togtilbud i Rogaland |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=31 August 1990 |page=11 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The increase in service involved 15 departures per direction per day, and the travel time from Stavanger to Egersund was reduced from 80 to 55 minutes.<ref name=nye>{{cite news |title=Nye J<U+00E6>rbanen |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=27 January 1992 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In addition, NSB started with a half-hour [[headway]] between Stavanger and Sandnes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nytt opplegg for NSBs lokaltrafikk p<U+00E5> J<U+00E6>ren |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=2 January 1992 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> A new station, Sandnes Sentrum, was opened in the city center of Sandnes at the time the new service started.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forsk.njk.no/stdb/index.php?mod=st&aut=&detaljert=1&baneID=166&Stnr=5108,02&sid=1897 |title=Sandnes sentrum |publisher=[[Norwegian Railway Club]] |accessdate=7 November 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> NSB stated that the goal was to increase the daily ridership from 2,900 to 5,000 passengers by 1994.<ref name=nye /> The stations were also upgraded, including new sheds.<ref name=byggpris>{{cite news |title=Byggeskikkprisen til NSB: Reise i god form |last=Stafne |first=Anne Lise |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=17 November 1993 |page=11 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The [[Scanet]] train radio system was installed between 1993 and 1996.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Train radio system for Norwegian State Railways |last=Solberg |first=Bj<U+00F8>rn Olav |issue=4 |year=1994 |work=Telektronikk |publisher=[[Telenor]] |pages=73<U+2013>81 |url=http://www.telenor.com/telektronikk/volumes/pdf/4.1995/Page_073-081.pdf |accessdate=24 October 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5tiypSO3C |archivedate=24 October 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Klepp stasjon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Klepp Station]]]]
The service was a success, and NSB received a 112% increase in ridership the first year. This resulted in the company introducing a similar service between [[Trondheim]] and [[Innherred]], the [[Tr<U+00F8>ndelag Commuter Rail]], in 1993.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tr<U+00F8>nderbanen skal gi NSB stor trafikk<U+00F8>kning  |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=1 September 1993 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In 1993, NSB won [[Statens Byggeskikkpris]], among other things for the new sheds on the J<U+00E6>ren Line.<ref name=byggpris /> By 1995, ridership was up 150% from before the service started.<ref>{{cite news |title=Toget g<U+00E5>r fra statsbanene |last=Width |first=Henrik |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=6 October 1995 |page=23 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In 1997, NSB announced that they would order 36 new electric multiple units, which would among other things replace the aging trains on the J<U+00E6>ren Commuter Rail.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bortkasted opprusting  |last=Thompson |first=Svein |work=[[Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv]] |date=9 January 1997 |page=8 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The new Class 72 trains were put into service on 8 August 2002, several years after schedule.<ref>{{cite news |title=To <U+00E5>rs ventetid over <U+2013> nye pendlertog p<U+00E5> vei til Oslo |last=B<U+00F8> |first=Trond |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=9 August 2002 |page=3 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In April 2004, the rail administration opened [[J<U+00E5>tt<U+00E5> Station]], which was located close to [[Viking Stadion]], the new home ground of [[Tippeligaen]] side [[Viking FK]].<ref>{{cite news |title=14 dager igjen: Her stopper Viking-toget |last=Andersen |first=Atle |work=[[Stavanger Aftenblad]] |date=17 April 2004 |page=30 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

By 2005, ridership had increased to 2.5 million per year, up 278% from 1991, giving a 7% market share in the corridor. To further increase capacity and regularity, the Norwegian National Rail Administration decided to rebuild the section from Stavanger to Sandnes to double track. At the same time, a new freight terminal was to be built at Ganddal, meaning that the section would only have to be shared with intercity trains. The upgrade involved closing Hillev<U+00E5>g Station, and building three new stations: Paradis, J<U+00E5>tt<U+00E5>v<U+00E5>gen and Gausel. Construction was started in 2006 and was estimated to be completed by 2009. It was estimated to cost 2.2 billion [[Norwegian krone]].<ref name=tospor />From April to November 2009, the section from Ganddal to Stavanger was closed while the last part of the upgrade was completed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jernbaneverket.no/PageFiles/1679/To_spor_Sandnes_-__1619932a.pdf |title=Offisiell <U+00E5>pning Sandnes-Stavanger 14. desember |publisher=[[Norwegian National Rail Administration]] |date=October 2006 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=7 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5u4FiUBIt |archivedate=7 November 2010}}</ref> The new line was opened on 16 November 2009 and from 14 December, the 15-minute headway was introduced between Stavanger and Sandnes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jernbaneverket.no/PageFiles/1679/To_spor_Sandnes_-__1619932a.pdf |title=F<U+00F8>rste heilskaplege bane sidan Gardermobanen |publisher=[[Norwegian National Rail Administration]] |date=17 November 2009 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=7 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5u4FX16tx |archivedate=7 November 2010}}</ref>

==Future==
[[File:Foss-Eikeland station.jpg|thumb|The <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Line, here at Foss-Eikeland, has been closed for passenger traffic since 1955, but is proposed as a new service on the J<U+00E6>ren Commuter Rail]]

The National Rail Administration has developed a plan for possible expansion of the commuter rail. The main possibilities have been discussed: rebuilding the section from Sandnes to Egersund to double track, taking back into use the <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Line, which branches off at Ganddal, and building a new branch from south of Gausel to Stavanger Airport, Sola. An alternative to several of the options is a light rail, which may or may not be built as a [[tram-train]], which would use parts of the existing double track between Stavanger and Sandnes.

The <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Line is a {{convert|12.24|km|adj=on|sp=us}} long railway which branches from the S<U+00F8>rland Line at Ganddal. It runs via [[Foss-Eikeland]] and [[Figgjo]] to [[<U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd]],<ref>Aspenberg (1994): 227</ref> and was opened on 20 December 1924.<ref>Thime (1999): 13</ref> Passenger services were terminated on on 1 November 1955, making it the line with the most frequent passenger traffic in Norway to be closed. Feight trains operated until the 1988.<ref>Aspenberg (1994): 230</ref> The first {{convert|3|km}} are used for freight trains to access a cement factory. The line has officially been closed, but has not been abandoned. The National Rail Administration retains ownership and can in the future renovate the line for operation.<ref name=onhold>{{cite web |title=Jernbaneverket vil beholde <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rdbanen |work=[[Stavanger Aftenblad]] |last=<U+00C5>dn<U+00F8>y |first=<U+00C5>smund |date=30 July 2008 |page=3 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The annual traffic potential for the <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Line is 600,000 passengers. Plans call for stations at [[Vagle]], Figgjo, [[Kongeparken]] and <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd. It is possible to operate the trains that currently terminate at Sandnes to <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd without new infrastructure investments to the S<U+00F8>rland Line. However, the line would need a full upgrade, including new tracks, electric system and signaling. <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd is also a good location for a [[park and ride]] for [[European route E39|European Route E39]].<ref>Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009a): 52<U+2013>56</ref>

A branch to Sola has been considered to allow the trains to operate to [[Sola]] and the airport. The line would branch from the S<U+00F8>rland Line south of Gausel, and be built so trains from the branch could run both northwards and southwards. Proposed stations include the airport, [[Solakrossen]], [[Forus]] West, [[Statoil]]'s head office and possibly the shopping center [[Kvadrat (shopping centre)|Kvadrat]]. This would give a travel time of 17 minutes from the airport to the city center, and 10 minutes from the airport to Sandnes. This route has, however, also been proposed as part of the light rail system. This will give about 2.5 million annual passengers.<ref>Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009a): 57<U+2013>58</ref>

Plans have been made that would either double or triple the frequency on all the services on the existing commuter rail network. However, increased frequency south of Sandnes will require double track. Should the frequency be doubled, double track would have to be built to where the current service to N<U+00E6>rbo terminates. Plans call for these trains to possibly be extended to either Varhaug or Vigrestad. Should the frequency be tripled, double track would be needed all the way to Egersund. Parts of the J<U+00E6>ren Line is straight enough to permit speeds between {{convert|200|and|250|km/h|sp=us}}. However, several shorter parts need to be rebuilt to allow this, particularly between Egersund and Ogna, and from Bryne to Ganddal. In particular, the section from Ogna to Egersund would probably have to follow an all-new route, should it be rebuilt to double track. The effect of higher maximum speeds is greatest for intercity trains, as the commuter trains have so frequent stops they have little to gain from the increased speeds.<ref>Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009a): 31<U+2013>35</ref>

When the J<U+00E6>ren Line was built, the station in Egersund was located in the city center. With the opening of the S<U+00F8>rland Line, the station was moved {{convert|1|km}} north of the city center. [[Egersund Station]] has been proposed moved back to its old location for the commuter rail, giving Egersund two stations: one for commuter trains and one for regional trains. The right-of-way still exists for this route, making construction easy. A new S<U+00F8>rland Line has also been proposed, which would run south instead of north from Egersund. This would mean that a city center location for Egersund Station would be better for intercity trains as well.<ref>Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009a): 61</ref>

Rogaland County Municipality is in the planning process of building a light rail in Greater Stavanger. The initial plans call for a Y-shaped service which could be operational by 2018, with possibilities for further expansion. As of 2010, the plans call for a {{convert|16.2|km}} line from Stavanger to Sandnes, and a {{convert|7.7|or|8.8|km}} branch to the airport. The travel time from Sandnes to Stavanger would be 29 minutes, and is therefore a supplement to the commuter rail. The light rail would have interchange with the light rail at Stavanger, Paradis, J<U+00E5>tt<U+00E5>v<U+00E5>gen, Gausel and Sandnes Sentrum. Several new branches of the light rail have been proposed for later construction.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tu.no/bygg/article238998.ece |title=Milliardbanen Kleppa kan stoppe |last=Tunmo |first=Truls |work=[[Teknisk Ukeblad]]|date=15 March 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=8 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5u5TecZqT |archivedate=8 November 2010}}</ref>
