The '''Bluewater Michigan Chapter of the [[National Railroad Historical Society]]'''<ref>NRHS webpage on Bluewater at http://www.nrhs.com/chapters/bluewater_michigan.htm</ref> (or simply, Bluewater) is a 501(c)(3) [[non-profit organization]] which owns a large fleet of historic railway passenger coaches and operates railway excursions.

Bluewater has been uniquely successful for two reasons:  First, an unusually large fraction of Michigan's railroads are in the hands of [[short-line railroad]]s, which are relatively welcoming to passenger excursions.  Second, they are the only non-profit organization in America to preserve a large fleet of mainline-capable coaches, and as such, their fleet is in demand by the numerous organizations which have preserved and restored operational locomotives - notably nearby [[Pere Marquette 1225]]. 

== History == 
=== Early years === 
Bluewater Michigan Chapter originally intended to exist in the [[Port Huron, Michigan]] area; thus the "Bluewater" name.  However they soon leased the former [[SEMTA]] Rail commuter rail maintenance facility in Pontiac, Michigan, adjacent to the large [[Grand Trunk Western]] yards there.

Bluewater focused on railway [[excursions]] around and beyond the state of Michigan, usually hauled by the host railroad's locomotives.  They also loaned their coach fleet out to other excursion operators. 

Many Bluewater members stored and maintained their privately owned coaches at Bluewater's yard locations.  This proved to be a symbiotic relationship, as Bluewater was able to use these coaches in their excursions, allowing passenger trains longer than 20 cars. 

In Owosso, Michigan, [[Michigan State Trust for Railway Preservation|Project 1225]] had restored the steam locomotive [[Pere Marquette 1225]] and allied with Bluewater to run excursion trains in 1989. <ref>Project 1225 Newsletter, Number 75, September 1989.</ref>

=== Saginaw relocation === 

Bluewater lost the lease to the SEMTA rail facility, and a search for a new location led them to the former [[Pere Marquette]] shops in [[Saginaw, Michigan]] which they lease from the [[Lake State Railway]].

=== Modern day ===

Bluewater operates occasional excursions around Michigan.  They also hold a monthly meeting in [[Royal Oak, Michigan]]. <ref>http://www.bluewaternrhs.com/MemberServices.html</ref>
