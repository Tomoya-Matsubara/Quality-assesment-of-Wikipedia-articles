'''Leif Johan Sverdrup''' (11 January 1898 <U+2013> 2 January 1976) was a [[Norwegian American]] [[civil engineer]] and [[General officer|general]] with the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] in the first half of the 20th century. He is best known for his service in the [[Southwest Pacific Area]] during [[World War II]] where he as Chief Engineer under [[General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]]. 

The son of a distinguished [[Norwegian]] family, Sverdrup emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1914. After serving with the [[US Army]] in [[World War I]] he earned a degree in [[civil engineering]] course at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1921. He worked for a time for the [[Missouri Department of Transportation|Missouri State Highway Department]] before founding [[Sverdrup & Parcel]], a civil engineering firm specializing in bridge construction, with John Ira Parcel, his former University of Minnesota engineering professor. His firm was involved in the construction of a number of important bridges, including the [[Washington Bridge (Washington, Missouri)|Washington Bridge]] and [[Amelia Earhart Bridge]] over the [[Missouri River]] and the [[Hurricane Deck Bridge]] over the [[Lake of the Ozarks]].

In 1941 he became involved with the construction of a chain of airstrips across the [[Pacific Ocean]] to enable heavy bombers to be delivered to the [[Philippines]]. He was re-commissioned in the US Army as a [[colonel (United States)|colonel]] in 1942 and became Chief of the Construction Section in General MacArthur's Southwest Pacific Area. In 1942 he made three treks across the [[Owen Stanley Range]] in [[Papua]] and [[New Guinea]] on engineer reconnaissance missions into enemy-occupied territory, for which he was decorated with the [[Silver Star]] and the [[Distinguished Service Medal (United States)|Distinguished Service Medal]]. In 1944 he became theater Chief Engineer.

After the war he commanded the [[102nd Infantry Division (United States)|102nd Infantry Division]] of the [[US Army Reserve]] from 1947 to 1958. Sverdrup & Parcel went on to designed and oversee the construction of many major projects, including the [[Arnold Engineering Development Center]] and the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel]], which was names as one of the Seven Engineering Wonders of the Modern World after its completion in 1964. The firm's reputation was later tarnished by the collapse of the [[I-35W Mississippi River bridge]] on 1 August 2007.

==Early life==
Leif Johan Sverdrup, was born in [[Solund|Ytre Sula]], [[Norway]], on 11 January 1898, the son of [[Edvard Sverdrup|Johan Edvard Sverdrup]], a high school teacher and [[Lutheran]] minister, and his second wife Agnes n<U+00E9>e Vollan. The family was a distinguished one in Norway. Leif was the great-nephew of [[Johan Sverdrup]], the former [[Prime Minister of Norway]]; the grandson of [[Harald Ulrik Sverdrup (politician)|Harald Ulrik Sverdrup]], the politician; the cousin of [[Otto Sverdrup]], the [[Artic]] explorer; the half-brother of the [[oceanography|oceanographer]] and [[meteorology|meteorologist]] [[Harald Sverdrup]]; and the brother of the mining engineer and businessman [[Einar Sverdrup]] and women's rights activist [[Mimi Sverdrup Lunden]].<ref>{{harvnb|Franzwa|Ely|1980|pp=1<U+2013>3}}</ref> 

Leif was educated at Nordstrand Middle School and Aars and Voss School in Oslo. Following a quarrel with his father, Leif left Norway for America to stay with his relatives in [[Minnesota]], the family of his cousin [[George Sverdrup]], the son of the theologian [[Georg Sverdrup (theologian)|Georg Sverdrup]],<ref>{{harvnb|Franzwa|Ely|1980|pp=8<U+2013>9}}</ref> who had settled in Minneapolis in 1874.<ref>{{harvnb|Franzwa|Ely|1980|p=3}}</ref> He arrived in [[New York City]] on 7 December 1914. He entered [[Augsburg College]], Minneapolis, in September 1916, graduating with his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in May 1918.<ref>{{harvnb|Franzwa|Ely|1980|pp=10<U+2013>13}}</ref>

==World War I==
Sverdrup enlisted in the [[US Army]] at [[Fort Snelling, Minnesota]] on 26 July 1918. He was posted to [[Fort Devens|Camp Devens, Massachusetts]] for training with the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Division]]. While there he took advantage of a regulation waiving the normal five-year residency requirement for members of the armed services seeking to take out [[Citizenship in the United States|US citizenship]]. Sverdrup formally took the oath as a citizen in [[Boston]] on 30 September 1918. The US Army then sent him to the [[Field Artillery Branch (United States)|Field Artillery]]'s Officer Training Center at [[Camp Zachary Taylor]], near [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where he was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] on 18 January 1919. The war having ended, Sverdrup was immediately placed in the [[Individual Ready Reserve|inactive reserves]]. He was [[Military discharge#Honorable|honorably discharged]] after nominally serving two five-year terms on 17 January 1929.<ref>{{harvnb|Franzwa|Ely|1980|pp=14<U+2013>15}}</ref>   

==Between the wars==
Sverdrup decided to become an engineer and enrolled in a [[civil engineering]] course at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1919. During the 1921 [[Spring break]] he returned to Norway, where he was reconciled with his father, accompanying his parents on a short holiday in [[Germany]]. He graduated with his Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering degree in June 1921. While at the University of Minnesota he met Helen Laura (Molly) Egilsrud, a recent immigrant from Norway like himself. She agreed to marry him, but only after she had graduated, worked for a year, and taken a trip to [[Europe]].<ref>{{harvnb|Franzwa|Ely|1980|pp=15<U+2013>20}}</ref> They were finally married on 26 November 1924. Their union produced two sons, Johan Norman (Jack) Sverdrup, born in 1926, and Ralph Lee Sverdrup, born in 1928, who died of [[encephalitis]] in 1932.<ref>{{harvnb|Franzwa|Ely|1980|pp=28<U+2013>29,42,52}}</ref> In the meantime, Sverdrup took a job with the [[Missouri Department of Transportation|Missouri State Highway Department]]. His first major project involved supervising the construction of a bridge for [[U.S. Route 50 in Missouri]] over the [[Gasconade River]].<ref>{{harvnb|Franzwa|Ely|1980|pp=21<U+2013>24}}</ref> Around this time, frustrated by Americans who pronounced his name "leaf" instead of "lafe", he started calling himself "Jack".<ref>{{harvnb|Franzwa|Ely|1980|p=30}}</ref> 

[[File:Platte-purchase-fairfax-bridges-from-south.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Platte Purchase and Fairfax Bridges, seen from the south bank.|alt=A pair of bridges, with of lot of steel trusses.]]
In 1928, Sverdrup joined with his former University of Minnesota engineering professor John Ira Parcel in the formation of [[Sverdrup & Parcel]], a civil engineering firm with a speciality field of bridges. Parcel had [[tenure]] at Minnesota for a long time and was reluctant to sever his ties completely, but eventually he decided to join the new company, taking an unpaid [[Sabbatical]] from the university for one year. Sverdrup owned 60% and Parcel 40%of the new firm, which opened its doors on 1 April 1928. Most of the company's projects were initially located in the [[St. Louis, Missouri]] area near the company's headquarters. Sverdrup & Parcel's first contract was for the design of a bridge over the [[Missouri River]] at [[Hermann, Missouri]], for which it received a fee of $33,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Franzwa|Ely|1980|pp=34<U+2013>39}}</ref> While at the Missouri State Highway Department Sverdrup met D. C. Wolfe and E. R. Grant, and he asked them if they would join the company. Sverdrup subsequently hired design engineer Brice R. Smith from Missouri's leading supplier of bridge components. By 1936, all three would become partners in the firm.<ref name="Sverdrup & Parcel">{{citation |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Sverdrup-Corporation-Company-History.html |title=Sverdrup Corporation - Company History |accessdate=21 February 2010 }}</ref> 

[[Image:Washington-bridge.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Washington Bridge from the southwest bank.|alt=A graceful truss bridge over a broad river.]]
Initially the young firm struggled, with no contracts for major jobs lined up after the Hermann bridge, and by early 1929 it faced insolvency. However neither Sverdrup nor Parcel wished to let well-trained employees go, something which became an informal company policy over the years. A $17,000 fee for the design and supervision of the construction of the [[7th Street Trafficway Bridge]] in Kansas City, Kansas, and then a  $32,000 one for the [[Fairfax Bridge (Missouri River)|Fairfax Bridge]] over the Missouri River helped Sverdrup & Parcel weather the worst of the [[Great Depression]]. The subsequent [[New Deal]] involved a major program of public works. Sverdrup & Parcel applied to the [[Public Works Administration]] for the design commissions for the [[Washington Bridge (Washington, Missouri)|Washington Bridge]] over the Missouri River at [[Washington, Missouri]] and the [[Hurricane Deck Bridge]] over the [[Lake of the Ozarks]] in [[Camden County, Missouri]]. Sverdrup & Parcel was awarded both contracts, valued at $42,00 and $43,000 respectively. During 1934, it was awarded the contract for what is now known as the [[Amelia Earhart Bridge]] over the over the Missouri River between [[Atchison, Kansas]] and [[Buchanan County, Missouri]].<ref>{{harvnb|Franzwa|Ely|1980|pp=54<U+2013>61}}</ref> Sverdrup & Parcel was now becoming involved in projects further afield. A project to generate electricity from [[tidal power]] at [[Passamaquoddy Bay]] brought Sverdrup into contact with [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] [[Hugh John Casey|Hugh J. (Pat) Casey]] of the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]], the chief engineer on the project. The project folded when federal funding was withdrawn in 1936, but Sverdrup and Casey became friends.<ref>{{harvnb|Franzwa|Ely|1980|p=62}}</ref> In 1940, Sverdrup was appointed to the board of inquiry that investigated the collapse of the [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge]].<ref>{{harvnb|Franzwa|Ely|1980|pp=78<U+2013>81}}</ref>

==World War II==
===Airbase construction===
In October 1941, the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] ordered work to commence on a chain of airstrips to enable heavy bombers to be flown from the United States to the [[Philippines]]. The existing route, via [[Midway Atoll]], [[Wake Island]] and [[Guam]] was considered to vulnerable to disruption by Japanese forces located on nearby islands. A more secure route via [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]], [[Canton Island]], [[Fiji]], [[Noumea]], [[Rockhampton]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] and [[Fort Stotsenburg]] was urgently required. An initial sum of $5 million was allotted to construct three {{convert|7000|ft|m|adj=on}} runways at each site, along with appropriate fuel and maintenance buildings. The project was given the highest possible priority rating. On 16 November, Sverdrup arrived in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] and signed a [[Cost-plus contract|cost-plus-fixed-fee contract]] for architectural and engineering services in connection with the construction of the airstrips on the route that lay in British, French and Australian territory. The contract was soon expanded to include the supervision of the construction. Sverdrup flew to Fiji, and was able to report that work had started at [[Nadi, Fiji]] on 21 November. On Noumea he found that hills obstructed the approaches to [[La Tontouta International Airport|Tontouta]]. Accordingly, he arranged for the Australian workmen there to complete it as an emergency field only and for development of the major airbase to be carried out at [[Plaine Des Gaiacs Airfield]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=45<U+2013>48}}</ref> Sverdrup was working in [[Suva]] when he heard the news of the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].<ref>{{harvnb|Franzwa|Ely|1980|pp=91<U+2013>92}}</ref> He arrived in [[Sydney]] on 30 December.<ref>{{harvnb|Franzwa|Ely|1980|p=95}}</ref> In January 1942 Sverdrup signed a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract to provide architectural and engineering services to US Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA). The contract remained in force until 15 may, when it was terminated by mutual agreement and Sverdrup & Parcel employees in Australia became civilian employees of the US Army.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1953|p=22}}</ref> On 16 April, Sverdrup boarded a the first of a series of aircraft that would return him to the United States.<ref name="Franzwa, pp. 107-108">{{harvnb|Franzwa|Ely|1980|pp=107<U+2013>108}}</ref>   

===New Guinea Campaign===
Meanwhile, back in Australia, [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] Pat Casey, now the Chief Engineer at [[General (United States)|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s General Headquarters (GHQ) [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area]] (SWPA), obtained MacArthur's permission to appoint Sverdrup as the chief of his Construction Section, with the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]].<ref name="Franzwa, pp. 107-108"/><ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=130<U+2013>131}}</ref> On 8 May 1942, in [[Washington, DC]], Sverdrup was directly commissioned as a colonel in the US Army. He was soon on his way back to Australia.<ref>{{harvnb|Franzwa|Ely|1980|p=110}}</ref> Initially, the construction effort focused on bases in northern Australia but after the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]], MacArthur was convinced that the Japanese would make another attempt to capture [[Port Moresby]] and ordered improvements to the airfields there and the construction of new bases at [[Merauke]] and [[Milne Bay]] in order to cover the approaches to Port Moresby. The July 1942 decision to attack the Japanese base at [[Rabaul]] altered priorities and added a requirement for the development of bases on the northern coast of [[Papua]] around Buna. The commander of Allied Air Forces, [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[George Brett (general)|George Brett]] called for 12 additional airstrips: four each at Port Moresby, Milne Bay and Buna. Sverdrup estimated that this would take a year, and suggested that either Brett lower his requirements or Casey obtain more engineer units. Casey ordered every available engineer unit to Papua and attempted to reduce the workload by cutting back on airbase facilities, shortening runways from {{convert|6000|ft|m}} to {{convert|4000|ft|m}}, and substituting [[Marsden Matting|Marsden mat]] for pavement.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=149<U+2013>153}}</ref>

[[Image:Allied Advance Across Owen Stanley Range 1942.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Allied advance across Owen Stanley Range 26 September - 15 November 1942.|alt=A map of Papua, indicating the various routes taken across the Owen Stanley Range.]] 
In September 1942, MacArthur decided to outflank Japanese troops on the [[Kokoda Trail]] by sending an American [[regimental combat team]] over the [[Owen Stanley Range]]. Two alternate means of crossing the mountains seemed possible. One, the [[Kapa Kapa Trail]] was known to climb to elevations above {{convert|9000|ft|m}} and present formidable obstacles. The other, known as the Abau Trail held the possibility. Casey and Sverdrup took charge of investigating the Abau Trail. They reached Abau on 18 September. Casey explored the harbor, taking depth soundings from a native canoe. Sverdrup set out for Jaure with a party of one American, two Australians from the [[Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit]], ten native police from the [[Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary|Royal Papuan Constabulary]] and 26 native carriers. After eight days on the trail, scaling heights of {{convert|5000|ft|m}}, Sverdrup concluded that it would not be practical for troops to traverse the route and turned back, reaching Abau on 3 October. Meanwhile Casey had concluded that the harbor was too shallow even for [[Lighter (barge)|lighters]]. However, the trip was not a total loss, for Sverdrup had sighted a plateau north of the Owen Stanley Range that he believed could be suitable for airstrips, allowing troops to be flown across the Owen Stanley Range. His opinion was supported by Cecil Abel, a missionary who knew the area well, who recommended establishing an airstrip at Fasari in the Musa River valley. Abel was flown to Fasari to make a start on an airstrip on 11 October, while Sverdrup set out from Abau with 190 men, including [[Flight Lieutenant]] M. J. Leahy, an expert on Papua, who knew many of the tribal chiefs personally. They reached Fasari on 18 October. Abel had cleared the site by burning and all that remained was some stumping and grubbing. A [[DC-3]] was able to land the next day on the strip, which became known as Abel's Landing. Sverdrup and Leahy set out on 20 October to explore further north and found another suitable airstrip site near the village of Embessa and Kinjaki, which Sverdrup had cleared. A message dropped by air instructed him to go to [[Pongani, Papua New Guinea|Pongani]], where he found troops of the Company C, 114th Engineer Battalion that had flown to [[Wanigela Airport|Wanigela airstrip]] and had made their way to Pongani by travelling along the coast by boat. Sverdrup supervised the construction of [[Pongani Airfield|Pongani airstrip]]. All three airstrips were soon in use.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=178<U+2013>180}}</ref> In December 1942, Sverdrup made a trhird trip, from the Australian base at [[Bena Bena]] through the [[Markham Valley]] to the vicinity of the Japanese base at [[Lae]]. On each expedition he submitted detailed reports on the possibility of construction in the area.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1948|pp=43<U+2013>44}}</ref> Sverdrup was awarded the [[Silver Star]]. His citation read:{{quote|For gallantry in action  near Abau, New Guinea [sic] from 18 September 1942 to 6 October 1942.

Sverdrup was subsequently awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]]. His citation read:{{quote|For exceptionally meritorious service to the Government in a position of great responsibility in Papua, New Guinea, during the period 23 July 1942 to 23 January 1943. During the Papuan campaign, Colonel Sverdrup personally executed numerous
reconnaissance missions in New Guinea, over difficult mountains and through swamp and jungle, far forward of the areas occupied by our troops, in order to secure vital information needed for engineering operations. Utilizing native labor, which he recruited and trained, equipped only with hand tools, he constructed with great rapidity a series of air fields urgently needed for the transport by air of troops and supplies to distant and otherwise inaccessible areas. His success in completion of these essential advance airfields, accomplished under severe physical hardship and at great personal risk, made possible the effective coordination of land and air forces and contributed materially to the success of the Papuan campaign.<ref>{{harvnb|Franzwa|Ely|1980|p=149}}</ref>}} 

===Philippines Campaign===
Sverdrup was promoted to brigadier general in May 1944.<ref name="Ancell and Miller">{{harvnb|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=313}}</ref> In July, Casey was appointed to head the Army Service Command (ASCOM), a special force designed to provide logistical support, establish bases, and run them until the [[Services of Supply|US Army Services of Supply]] (USASOS) was ready to take over. Sverdrup became acting Chief Engineer, GHQ SWPA in Casey's absence.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1947|p=205}}</ref> On 12 January 1945, MacArthur personally decorated Sverdrup with the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]]. His citation read:{{quote|For extraordinary heroism in action against the enemy at Lingayen, Luzon, Philippine Islands, on 9 January 1945. Landing with the first wave of assault troops and with complete disregard for his own safety, he proceeded immediately to render invaluable assistance in the seizure of the vital Lingayen airfield. General Sverdrup's exceptional courage, initiative determination contributed immeasurably to the success accomplishment of the mission.<ref name="Franwa, p. 210">{{harvnb|Franzwa|Ely|1980|p=210}}</ref>}} 
Sverdrup became the first American to be decorated for the [[Battle of Luzon|Luzon campaign]]. MacArthur, in making the presentation, said: "This is the engineer soldier at his best."<ref name="Franwa, p. 210"/> 
Sverdrup was promoted to major general in March 1945.<ref name="Ancell and Miller"/> On 6 March 1945, the Engineer Construction Command (ENCOM) was formed under USASOS to handle all military and civilian construction in the Philippines and Sverdrup was appointed to command it.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1947|p=307}}</ref> Later in 1945 MacArthur made a more personal gesture. He presented Sverdrup with his personal [[Gold Castles]] insignia, a gift from his father, [[Arthur MacArthur, Jr.]], on his graduation from the [[U.S. Military Academy]]. MacArthur had not worn them since he had transferred to the infantry. He told Sverdrup that "they deserved to be worn by a real engineer" and made him promise that they would not end up in a museum.<ref name="Franzwa, pp. 361-362">{{harvnb|Franzwa|Ely|1980|pp=361<U+2013>362}}</ref>

===Occupation of Japan===
In August 1945, Sverdrup flew home on MacArthur's private aircraft, the ''Bataan'', accompanying Lieutenant General [[Richard K. Sutherland]] to Washington, DC for a series of meetings at [[The Pentagon]] before going on leave. The [[Surrender of Japan]] caused Sverdrup to cut short his leave and return to GHQ in [[Manila]]. On 29 August 1945, Sverdrup landed in Japan. He entered [[Tokyo]] the next day with Casey to find a site for GHQ, which they decided to locate in the [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo]]. On 2 September, Sverdrup attended the formal surrender aboard the {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}}. He received the [[Legion of Merit]] on 21 September before departing for home again the next day.<ref>{{harvnb|Franzwa|Ely|1980|pp=230<U+2013>240}}</ref>

Sverdrup returned to Sverdrup & Parcel, but with much less personal involvement than before, as Grant was now running the company, which was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in 1946.

==Legacy==
Leif J. Sverdrup died on 2 January 1976 and was interred in Valhalla Cemetery in [[Hanley Hills, Missouri|Hanley Hills]], a suburb of St Louis, with full military honors. Years after his death, many of Sverdrup's accomplishments continue to serve their missions, a silent testimony to his engineering skills. A number of professional organizations also began annual award programs in his honor and memory. The John I. Parcel - Leif J.
