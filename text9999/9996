==Hartlepool United==
===Hartlepool Breakthrough===
While at Hartlepool<U+2019>s youth team he quickly impressed the coaching staff of Mick Smith and Billy Horner. Despite having been in the [[Youth system|youth team]] only for a short amount of time, he was given a surprising last minute call up to the [[first team]] at only 16 years of age. Boyd eventually made his debut against [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] and was an immediate success after coming on a [[Substitute (football)|substitute]] and scoring a dramatic last minute [[Goal (sport)|goal]] from a tight angle in his debut game.<ref name="echoboyd">{{cite news

===Under Neale Cooper and Onwards===
Boyd<U+2019>s lack of first team appearances prompted the newly appointed Hartlepool manager [[Neale Cooper]] to [[Loan (football)|loan]] him to [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]] in order to gain match practice. During his time at Boston, Boyd won critical acclaim from Boston manager [[Neil Thompson]] and played a total of 14 matches scoring 4 goals before returning to Hartlepool.<ref name=" bbcbostonboyd">{{cite news
