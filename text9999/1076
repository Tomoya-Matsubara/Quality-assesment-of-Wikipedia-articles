[[Air Commodore]] '''Raymond James Brownell''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Military Medal|MM]] (17 May 1894 &ndash; 12 April 1974) was a senior officer in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) and a [[First World War]] [[flying ace]]. Born in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]], Brownell was working as a clerk with a firm of accountants when he enlisted in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] on the outbreak of the First World War. He served during the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] before transferring to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Awarded the [[Military Medal]] for his actions during the [[Battle of Pozi<U+00E8>res]], he was accepted for a transfer to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] in 1917. Brownell undertook flight training in the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Officer (armed forces)|Commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]], he was posted for operational service over the Western Front in September 1917. Moving with his squadron to [[Italy]], he was awarded the [[Military Cross]] and credited with shooting down 12 aircraft by war's end. Taking his discharge in 1919, Brownell returned to Australia.

Commissioned in the Royal Australian Air Force during 1921, Brownell had risen to the rank of [[group captain]] by the beginning of the [[Second World War]]. Establishing the Royal Australian Air Force base in [[Singapore]], he returned to Australia in 1941 as an air commodore and was appointed to lead No. 1 Training Group. He was [[Air Officer Commanding]] Western Area from January 1943 until July 1945, when he took charge of the recently formed [[No. 11 Group RAAF|No.&nbsp;11 Group]] on [[Morotai]]. Retiring from the Air Force in 1947, Brownell assumed a partnership in a stockbroking firm. He died in 1974 at the age of 79; his autobiography, ''From Khaki to Blue'', was published posthumously.

==Early life==
Brownell was born in the Hobart suburb of [[New Town, Tasmania|New Town]], Tasmania, on 17 May 1894 to William Percival Brownell, a [[draper]], and his wife Julie Ann James (n<U+00E9>e Scott). Initially educated at Leslie House School, Brownell later attended [[Scotch College, Melbourne]] where he was an active sportsman. On graduation, he was apprenticed to a firm of public accountants and auditors in Hobart.<ref name="ADB">{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Edmonds|first=Leigh|year=1993|id=A130318b|title=Brownell, Raymond James (1894 &ndash; 1974)|accessdate=24 March 2009}}</ref> During 1912, Brownell enlisted in the [[Citizens Military Force]] and was posted to the 41st Battery, [[Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery|Australian Field Artillery]].<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="ServRec">{{cite web|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/imagine.asp?B=3131872&I=1&SE=1|title=Brownell, Raymond James : SERN 2058|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=24 March 2009|work=Records Search|publisher=National Archives of Australia}}</ref>

With reference to the awards conferred as announced in the London Gazette dated 4th March, 1918, the following are the statements of service for which the decorations were conferred:<U+2014>

Awarded the Military Cross.

2nd Lt. Raymond James Brownell, M.M., R.F.C., Spec. Res.

For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. Within the last three months he has brought down six enemy aeroplanes, four of which were seen to come down in flames, the other two falling completely out of control. The dash, gallantry and offensive spirit displayed on all occasions by this officer are worthy of the highest praise.}}

During April 1918, Brownell was granted compassionate leave to visit his seriously ill mother. Leaving No.&nbsp;45 Squadron, he travelled to Tasmania. At the end of his leave in September, he commenced his return journey to the United Kingdom. During the voyage, he became grievously ill with [[Pneumonia|pneumonic]] [[influenza]]. On arrival, Brownell accepted a commission in the newly formed [[Royal Air Force]]. However, Brownell's mother again suffered a deterioration in health,<ref name="ADB"/> so he sought to resign from the Royal Air Force and was placed on the unemployed list on 14 August 1919.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=31522|date=26 August 1919|startpage=10760|accessdaymonth=24 March|accessyear=2009}}</ref> Embarking for Tasmania, he arrived during September.<ref name="ADB"/>

On his return to Australia, Brownell was employed as a sub-accountant for a firm of merchants in [[Melbourne]], and later with the Hobart City Council as a clerk.<ref name="ADB"/> Seeking a position in the newly formed Royal Australian Air Force, Brownell was commissioned as a [[flying officer]] on 12 September 1921 and posted to [[RAAF Williams|RAAF Point Cook]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]],<ref name="ADB"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&VeteranID=1204617|title=Brownell, Raymond James|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=24 March 2009|work=World War II Nominal Roll|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia}}</ref> training Air Force cadets.<ref name="No.25"/> In a ceremony at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Hobart, on 26 August 1925, Brownell married Rhyllis Jean Birchall; the couple would later have two daughters.<ref name="ADB"/> The following year, Brownell assumed command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 Squadron]]. He led the squadron until 1928, when he was appointed to the Royal Australian Air Force Headquarters in [[Melbourne]] as Director of Personnel Services.<ref name="Oxford"/>

During 1934, Brownell was posted to England for exchange service with the Royal Air Force. Made second-in-command of No.&nbsp;3 Flying Training School at [[Grantham, England|Grantham]], he was promoted to [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] on 1 April 1936. While still serving in the United Kingdom, Brownell was appointed commanding officer of [[No. 25 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;23 (City of Perth) Squadron]] (later No.&nbsp;25 Squadron), which had been formed earlier in 1937. The squadron moved to [[RAAF Base Pearce]] in [[Western Australia]] during March 1938, at which time Brownell returned to Australia and assumed command of the unit along with the base.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="No.25"/> Brownell was the first Commanding Officer of Pearce, which was the first RAAF establishment to be located in Western Australia.<ref name="Oxford"/>

==Second World War==
[[File:Raymond Brownell Malaya 007599.JPG|thumb|upright|right|Group Captain Brownell in Malaya. c.1941]]

On the outbreak of the Second World War, additional units were placed under Brownell's purview at RAAF Base Pearce and he was consequently promoted to temporary group captain in December 1939.<ref name="ADB"/> With the introduction of [[Lockheed Hudson]] aircraft to the Royal Australian Air Force in February 1940, several units were re-equipped, including [[No. 14 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;14 Squadron]] at RAAF Base Pearce. The Hudsons replaced the squadron's [[Avro Anson]]s, which were to be ferried back to the eastern coast of Australia in order to be used as training aircraft. On one occasion, Brownell took part in ferrying an Anson to RAAF Point Cook with No.&nbsp;14 Squadron pilot [[Charles Learmonth]]. Arriving with the aircraft, the pair piloted a [[de Havilland Moth Minor]]&mdash;a two-seated, open-cockpit, monoplane&mdash;back to Pearce. The return journey took Brownell and Learmonth seven days to complete, and involved a total of twenty-one refuelling stops along the way.<ref>{{Harvnb|Page|2008|pp=79&ndash;80}}</ref>

During August 1940, Brownell was ordered to Singapore in order to establish and command an RAAF station on the island, as well as administer the RAAF squadrons located in [[Malaysia|Malaya]].<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="Gillison">{{Harvnb|Gillison|1962|p=142}}</ref> Embarking aboard the SS ''Strathallan'' in mid-August, Brownell and his staff formed the RAAF station within two weeks of arrival at [[Sembawang]]. Under the control of [[Far East Air Force (Royal Air Force)|RAF Far East Command]], the station was established as [[Sembawang Air Base|RAF Sembawang]].<ref name="Gillison"/> During this time, Brownell frequently visited the Malaya peninsula.<ref name="ADB"/>

Promoted to acting air commodore, Brownell returned to Australia during August 1941 and was appointed Air Officer Commanding No.&nbsp;1 Training Group in Melbourne. With this position, Brownell was in command of approximately thirty establishments located in southern Australia. On 1 January 1943, he was posted as Air Officer Commanding Western Area. Based at RAAF Base Pearce, Brownell's responsibilities involved coordinating training and directing long-range bombing operations.<ref name="ADB"/> Following intelligence reports that a Japanese force was en-route to raid Western Australia, the [[Australian Government]] ordered a build-up to defences in the area. In response to this, Brownell organised air defences around [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and the [[Exmouth Gulf]] during March 1944. With the use of Army transports, he also reinforced [[Cunderdin, Western Australia|Cunderdin]] with supplies and bombs for the use of the heavy bombers in the area. The attack from the Japanese, however, did not occur.<ref>{{Harvnb|Odgers|1968|p=136}}</ref> For his service as Air Officer Commanding Western Area, Brownell was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the 1945 New Years Honours.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=36866|date=1 January 1945|startpage=18|supp=yes|accessdaymonth=24 March|accessyear=2009}}</ref>

Relinquishing command of Western Area in July 1945, Brownell was appointed commander of the recently formed [[No. 11 Group RAAF|No.&nbsp;11 Group]].<ref name="ADB"/> No.&nbsp;11 Group was established as a static organisation that was to take administrative control of all RAAF units based on [[Morotai]]. The group assumed its role on 30 July, and had the initial jurisdiction of all Dutch territory in the area, along with [[British North Borneo]] and [[Sarawak]]. In addition to this, the unit held the three main responsibilities of local air defence and sea lane protection, support of adjacent formations and offensive operations against Japanese targets within range, as well as line-of-communication duties. The unit, however, was formed too late in the war to assume all of its responsibilities before the Second World War drew to an end.<ref>{{Harvnb|Odgers|1968|p=478}}</ref> Brownell was present at the Japanese surrenders in [[Manila]], [[Tokyo]], and on Morotai.<ref name="ADB"/> He was selected by the Australian government to attend the ceremony aboard the [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] on 2 September 1945, but was replaced by the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], when Jones became available to make the trip to Japan.<ref>{{Harvnb|Helson|2006|pp=220&ndash;221}}</ref>

==Later life==
Returning to Western Australia after the war,<ref name="ADB"/> Brownell attended an investiture ceremony at [[Government House, Perth]] on 3 January 1947, where he was presented with his Commander of the Order of the British Empire by the Lieutenant-[[Governor of Western Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00306/003060347.pdf|title=Recommendation for Raymond James Brownell to be awarded a Commander of the Order of the British Empire|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=24 March 2009|format=PDF|work=Index to Recommendations: Second World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}</ref> On 24 March that year, Brownell retired from the Royal Australian Air Force on medical grounds.<ref name="ADB"/> He had in any case been slated for early retirement, along with a number of other senior officers and veterans of the First World War, to make way for the advancement of younger and equally capable officers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Helson|2006|p=234}}</ref>

Following his retirement from the Air Force, Brownell was made a partner of S. G. Brearley & Co., a stockbroking firm located in Perth. In 1951, he was made chairman of the associated sporting committee of the National Fitness Council of Western Australia; he served in this role until 1967. Aged 79, Brownell died at [[Subiaco, Western Australia]], on 12 April 1974 and was accorded a funeral with full Air Force honours. Brownell's autobiography, ''From Khaki to Blue'', was posthumously published in 1978.<ref name="ADB"/>
