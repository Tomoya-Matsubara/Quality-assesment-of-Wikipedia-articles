'''''Boletus edulis''''' is the [[Latin]] name for a highly regarded edible [[mushroom]]. It has a number of English names, including '''cep''' (from its [[Catalan language|Catalan]] name ''cep'' or its [[French language|French]] name '''c<U+00E8>pe'''), '''king bolete''' and '''penny bun'''. A common term in current use is [[porcini]] (from the plural of its [[Italian language|Italian]] name '''porcino''').

The scientific name, ''[[Boletus]]'', from the [[Latin]] stem ''bolet-'', meaning "superior mushroom" and ''edulis'', meaning edible, explains the species' culinary qualities. This mushroom has a distinct aroma reminiscent of fermented dough. It has a higher water content than other edible mushrooms.

==Other names==
The mushroom is known as ''Ontto txuri''  or "the blond" in [[Basque language|Basque]], ''h<U+0159>ib prav<U+00FD>'' ([[Czech language|Czech]]), ''cep'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]) ''varg<U+00E1>nya'' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]), ''borowik szlachetny'' ([[Polish language|Polish]]), ''baravykas'' ([[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]), ''belyj grib'' "white mushroom" or ''borovik'' ([[Russian language|Russian]]), ''dub<U+00E1>k'' or ''hr<U+00ED>b smrekov<U+00FD>'' ([[Slovakian language|Slovakian]]), ''jur<U+010D>ek'' or ''jesenski goban'' ([[Slovenian language|Slovenian]]), ''hrib'' or ''m<U+00E2>n<U+0103>tarc<U+0103>'' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]), ''manatarka'' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]), ''herkkutatti'' or "delicious bolete" ([[Finnish language|Finnish]]), ''harilik kivipuravik'' or "common bolete" ([[Estonian language|Estonian]]), ''Karljohan'' after King [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Charles XIV John]]) or ''stensopp'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]), ''steinsopp'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), ''Karl Johan'' or ''spiselig r<U+00F8>rhat'' ([[Danish language|Danish]]), ''eekhoorntjesbrood'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]), ''vrganj'' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]) and ''Steinpilz'' ([[German language|German]]).

The cap of this mushroom is 7<U+2013>30&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]] broad at maturity, and mostly reddish-brown fading to white in areas near the margin; the color continues to darken as it matures. The stalk is 8<U+2013>25&nbsp;cm in height, and up to 7 &nbsp;cm thick<U+2014>rather large in comparison to the cap.  The pores, which do not stain when bruised, are white in youth, fading to yellow and then to brown with age.  Fully mature specimens can weigh about 2&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|pounds]] (1&nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]]). However, the most appreciated by gourmands are the young small porcini, as the large ones often harbor [[maggot]]s (insect larvae), and they become slimy and less tasty with age.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:Fungo-Borgotaro-IGP.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Logo of the PGI Fungo di Borgotaro]]
''Boletus edulis'' can be found most commonly in [[Europe]] and western [[North America]]. The mushroom can grow singly or in clusters. Its habitat consists of areas dominated by [[oak]], [[pine]], [[spruce]], and [[fir]] trees. Not limited to these locations, the King Bolete is also found in hardwood forests containing oaks. It fruits from summer to autumn, following sustained rainfall. This mushroom can be found during the Fall in Syria and Lebanon where it grows in large clusters on decaying oak tree stumps.

It is well known to grow in the [[Borgotaro]] area of [[Parma]], [[Italy]], and has [[Protected designation of origin|PGI]] status there.

''Boletus edulis'' has been reported from the vicinity of [[Christchurch]] in [[New Zealand]], where it is likely to have been somehow introduced<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no |author = Stringer A ''et. al.''| year = 2004 | title = ''Boletus edulis'' Bull. Ex Fries in New Zealand.| journal = Australasian Mycological Society Newsletter| volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 6}}</ref>.

==Culinary uses==
[[Image:Steinpilz 2006 08 3.jpg|thumb|A collection of ceps of varying ages]]
As the name implies, ''Boletus edulis'' is edible, and most people consider it superior in flavor and in texture. It is described as nutty and slightly meaty, with a smooth, creamy texture.  Porcini are eaten and enjoyed raw, saut<U+00E9>ed with [[butter]], ground into [[pasta]], in [[risotto]], in soups, and in many other dishes.

They are widely exported and sold in dried form, reaching countries where they do not occur naturally, such as Australia.

''Boletus edulis'', along with ''Boletus badius'' and other boletes can be dried by stringing them separately on twine and hanging close to the ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively they can be cleaned, but DO NOT wash, and then place in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer on top of a boiler or hot water tank. Once dry keep in an airtight jar. Drying them in the oven is inadvisable as it can result in them being cooked and spoiling. Considering that in the UK, boletes cost [[Pound Sterling|GB<U+00A3>]]2.50 for 25&nbsp;[[gram]]s dried, it is important to preserve them without damage.

==Related species==
There are many fungi belonging to the genus, some edible, and some poisonous. In France, in addition to ''Boletus edulis''  (or ''c<U+00E8>pe de Bordeaux''), the most popular are
*''T<U+00EA>te de n<U+00E8>gre'' (negro<U+2019>s head; ''[[Boletus aereus]]''), much rarer than the ''Boletus edulis'', is by far the most appreciated by gourmets, as well as the most expensive. Usually smaller than the ''Boletus edulis'', it is also distinctively darker in colour.
*''C<U+00E8>pe des pins'' (pine tree cep; ''[[Boletus pinophilus]]'' or ''[[Boletus pinicola]]'') grows among pine trees. Its pores are characteristically bright yellow. It is less appreciated by gourmets than the two other kinds of porcini, but remains a mushroom ranking above most others.
*''C<U+00E8>pe d'<U+00E9>t<U+00E9>'' (summer cep; ''[[Boletus aestivalis]]'')

In parts of Colorado and New Mexico (and possibly elsewhere) there is a species ''[[Boletus barrowsii]]'', named after its discoverer Chuck Barrows. [http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/Toms_fungi/aug2004.html] It is mycorrhizal with Ponderosa pine and hence tends to grow in areas where there is less rainfall. Some find it as good as if not better than ''Boletus edulis''.
