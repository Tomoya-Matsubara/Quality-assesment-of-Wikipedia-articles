'''Thurman Lowell Tucker''' (September 26, 1917{{ndash}} May 7, 1993) was an [[United States|American]] [[center fielder]] in [[Major League Baseball]] who played for nine seasons in the [[American League]] with the [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[Cleveland Indians]]. In 701 career games, Tucker posted a [[batting average]] of .255 and had 24 [[triple (baseball)|triples]], 9 [[home run]]s, and 179 [[runs batted in]] (RBI). He was nicknamed "Joe E." Tucker because of his resemblance to comedian [[Joe E. Brown]].<ref name=digest>{{cite news|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pTIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA81#v=onepage&q&f=false|first=Bob|last=DuVall|title=Whatever Became Of....|work=[[Baseball Digest]]|date=July 1971|page=81|accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref>

Born and raised in Texas, Tucker first played professionally with the [[Siloam Springs Travelers]]. He gradually moved up the levels of minor league baseball and was signed by the [[Chicago White Sox]] before the 1941 season. He made his major league debut a year later. Tucker spent two seasons as the starting center fielder for the White Sox before enlisting in the armed forces for [[World War II]]. He played two more seasons for the White Sox after returning, then he was traded to the [[Cleveland Indians]]. Tucker played four seasons for the Indians, and continued to play minor league baseball throughout the 1950s. After retirement, he worked as a major league scout and insurance agent until his death in 1993.

==Early life==
Thurman Tucker was born and raised in [[Gordon, Texas]]. While attending high school, he was a three-sport athlete, playing baseball (where he was a [[second baseman]]), [[basketball]], and [[track and field]]. After graduating from high school in 1935, he played some semi-professional baseball, and later enrolled in a baseball school located in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]]. Tucker began his professional career at the age of 18 in 1936 when he signed with the [[Fayetteville Bears]] of the [[Arkansas-Missouri League]]. He lasted two weeks with the team, not playing in a game for them. However, he was signed soon after by the [[Siloam Springs Travelers]] in the same league, where he began his professional career.<ref name=vaughan>{{cite news|first=Irving|last=Vaughan|title=They Laugh When Tucker Makes Joe Brown Faces, But He's No Joke to Rivals When He Runs the Bases|work=[[The Sporting News]]|date=June 17, 1943|page=3}}</ref>

==Minor league career==
Tucker spent his first season with the Travelers, where he changed positions and became an outfielder.<ref name=vaughan/> He played in 117 games for the Travelers, finishing the season with a .319 [[batting average]] and 25 [[double (baseball)|doubles]].<ref name=brm>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=tucker001thu|title=Thurman Tucker Minor League Statistics & History|work=[[Baseball-Reference]]|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref> In 1937, he was to play for the [[El Dorado Lions]] of the [[Cotton States League]], but a back injury caused him to miss nearly the entire season.<ref name=vaughan/> Tucker spent the 1938 season with two separate minor league clubs. He played 55 games for the [[Abbeville A's]] of the [[Evangeline Baseball League]] and 50 games for the [[Greenville Bucks]] of the Cotton States League.<ref name=brm/> In 1939, he remained in the Cotton States League and played for the [[Clarksdale Red Sox]], who were a minor league affiliate of the [[Boston Red Sox]] at the time. In 136 games for Clarksdale, Tucker had a .298 batting average and 10 [[triple (baseball)|triples]].<ref name=brm/>

Tucker had a breakthrough minor league season in 1940 when he continued to play for Clarksdale. By the end of June, he was leading the Cotton State League with a batting average of .374.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cotton States League|work=The Sporting News|date=June 27, 1940|page=11}}</ref> After playing in 97 games, finishing with an average of .390, Tucker played in 40 games for the [[Oklahoma City Indians]].<ref name=brm/> After the season ended, Chicago White Sox farm manager Billy Webb was impressed enough with Tucker's play that he purchased Tucker's contract from Oklahoma City.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dykes Checks Off For Untouchables|work=The Sporting News|date=November 14, 1940|page=5}}</ref> The 1941 season began with Tucker competing with [[Dave Short]] for the final outfield spot on the White Sox roster.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CXtGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_ucMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1132,1624782|title=White Sox May Worry Other Clubs if New Talent Produces|work=[[Schenectady Gazette]]|page=31|date=March 14, 1941}}</ref> Tucker lost the battle and spent the 1941 season at Oklahoma City, where he was coached by [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] [[Rogers Hornsby]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Tucker, Back From White Sox, Delights Oklahoma City Fans|work=The Sporting News|first=John|last=Cronley|page=8|date=April 10, 1941}}</ref> In 141 games for the Indians, Tucker had a batting average of .246 and 12 triples.<ref name=brm/>

==Chicago White Sox==
The Chicago White Sox had several question marks in the outfield to begin the 1943 season, with only [[Wally Moses]] being assured of a job. After spring training began, manager [[Jimmy Dykes]] liked what he saw out of Tucker while competing for the starting center fielder position alongside [[Moose Solters]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Rookies Hold Key to ChiSox Fortunes|work=[[The Palm Beach Post]]|date=March 28, 1943|page=14}}</ref> As a result, after spring training ended Tucker not only became the starting center fielder during the 1943 season, but was the team's leadoff hitter as well.<ref>{{cite news|title=Speedy Tucker ChiSox Fielder|work=[[Prescott Evening Courier]]|date=April 16, 1943|page=5}}</ref> Partway through the season, Tucker's performance caught the eye of American League President [[Will Harridge]], who noted him as someone the public was coming out to watch with the absence of stars who were serving in [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Hugh|last=Fullerton, Jr.|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=APouAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8tsFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3115,306619|title=Absence of Stars Means Close Race|work=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=June 2, 1943|page=14}}</ref> His performance during the season included a [[walk-off home run]] to win a game against the [[New York Yankees]] on July 26, 2&ndash;1.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cardinals Continue Pennant March|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tSRdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=v1oNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2413,2350213|work=[[Lawrence Journal-World]]|date=July 26, 1943|page=6}}</ref> Tucker finished the season with a .235 batting average, six triples, and 79 [[base on balls|walks]] in 135 games.

Tucker passed a physical examination for the [[United States Navy]] before the 1944 season began, and was projected to be called up to serve in [[World War II]] that year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o4dHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qHwMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5355,4632610|title=Briefs From Training Camps|work=[[Warsaw Daily Times]]|date=March 23, 1944|page=5}}</ref> He was not called in, and ended up playing the entire season for the White Sox.

Tucker's hitting began to slow down after being named to the All-Star Game. In early July, he had a hitless streak of 28 at-bats, causing his batting average to shrink from .375 to .327, losing his status as league leader in batting average in the process.<ref>{{cite news|title=Babe O'Rourke in Hospital|work=The Sporting News|date=July 13, 1944|page=14}}</ref> After his batting average fell to .320 after hitting once in 35 at-bats, he was benched for a weekend matchup against the [[Detroit Tigers]] in an attempt to stop his sudden cold streak.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sJggAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kGgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3822,1087541|title=3 Red Sox Holding Spots In League's Top 4 In Batting|work=[[Lewiston Daily Sun]]|date=July 18, 1944|page=8}}</ref> At the end of July, both Tucker and [[George Case]] participated in a 75&ndash;yard dash at part of the White Sox's annual benefit for the war; Tucker lost the race to Case by a yard.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=v-0ZAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ESMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4404,4312089|title=Case, Nat Speeder, Is First In Dash|work=[[The Milwaukee Journal]]|date=July 27, 1944|page=11}}</ref> Tucker finished the season with a batting average of .287 and six triples.<ref name=br/> After the season ended, Tucker formally joined the Navy, and he spent the 1945 season serving in World War II.<ref>{{cite news|title=Thurman Tucker, Sox Outfielder, Joins Navy|work=Chicago Daily Tribune|page=A2|date=November 19, 1944}}</ref>

Upon everyone returning to their teams at the end of the war, Tucker was slated to be the starting center fielder as the 1946 season began, working alongside Wally Moses and [[Taffy Wright]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TYsiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SK8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=923,4650923|title=White Sox Outlook is Dull Despite Return of Lyons|work=[[Beaver County Times]]|date=March 23, 1946|page=23}}</ref> Unlike the previous season, he originally struggled with the bat, and was relegated to his original status as a good fielder but a poor hitter.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5UdjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SXUNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3061,6447671|title=Dykes May Be On Way Out As Sox Sink Lower|first=Charles|last=Einstein|work=[[The Telegraph-Herald]]|date=May 21, 1946|page=10}}</ref> At the end of June, Tucker had a batting average of .229, nearly 150 points lower than his average at the same point in 1944.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=tucketh01&t=b&year=1946|title=Thurman Tucker 1946 Batting Gamelogs|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=August 16, 2011}}</ref> He rebounded in the second half of the season though, finishing the year with a batting average of .288 and 20 doubles, both career highs.<ref name=br/> As the [[1947 Chicago White Sox season]] began, Tucker remained in his center field position after hitting .400 in the last month of the 1946 season, while rookie Dave Philley was in left field and Taffy Wright and [[Bob Kennedy]] [[platoon system|platooned]] in right field.<ref>{{cite news|first=Milt|last=Woodard|authorlink=Milt Woodard|title=Balky Philley Reined By Sox|work=The Sporting News|date=March 12, 1947|page=10}}</ref> He started off the year, however, by missing some playing time due to a stomach ailment, and did not start playing for the White Sox full time until the middle of May.<ref>{{cite news|first=Milt|last=Woodard|title=ChiSox Flag Pulse, Gate Beat in Unison|work=The Sporting News|date=May 14, 1947|page=8}}</ref> Tucker ended up splitting time with Philley due to his light hitting, and he finished the season with a .236 batting average in 89 games.<ref name=br/>

==Cleveland Indians==
On January 27, 1948, Tucker was traded to the [[Cleveland Indians]] for [[Ralph Weigel]]; the Indians made the move because they regarded Tucker as "the finest defensive player in baseball."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EkdjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zXQNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3676,4701484|title=Tribe Trades Weigel for Thurman Tucker|work=The Telegraph-Herald|date=January 28, 1948|page=11}}</ref> He started off the year as the starting center fielder for the Indians, and in one early matchup against the Detroit Tigers, he was the only player not to record a hit in an 8&ndash;2 victory.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JMJQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RtAMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5274,1222276|title=Indians Lead in American Loop|work=[[The Portsmouth Times]]|date=April 24, 1948|page=15}}</ref> He missed a couple weeks of playing time in June due to being hit by a pitch, resulting in a broken finger.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ed|last=McAuley|title=Tribe Finally Sours on Seerey, Welcomes Addition of Kennedy|work=The Sporting News|date=June 9, 1948|page=4}}</ref> After returning to the lineup, Tucker spent most of the second half of the season as a [[fourth outfielder]], splitting time with [[Allie Clark]] and playing int he outfield alongside [[Larry Doby]] and [[Dale Mitchell]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Muncrief Hit By Line Drive|work=The Sporting News|page=10|date=June 30, 1948}}</ref> He finished the season with a .260 batting average and 52 runs in 83 games, and also ended the season with a perfect [[fielding percentage]] of 1.000.<ref name=br/> Tucker also participated in game six of the [[1948 World Series]], scoring a run in the sixth inning on a walk en route to a 4&ndash;3 win for the Indians.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sixth Game|work=The Sporting News|date=October 20, 1948|page=17}}</ref>

The Indians planned to use Tucker as their fourth outfielder for the 1949 season; he served mostly as the backup to Doby for that season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Lhw1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=0_ADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6755,1027406|title=Cleveland Strong But Lacks Support|work=[[Eugene Register-Guard]]|page=6|date=April 5, 1949}}</ref> He was also relegated mostly to [[pinch hitting]] duties, and he finished the season with a .244 batting average in 20 games and under 200 at-bats.<ref name=br/> Due to his hitting struggles, Indians manager [[Lou Boudreau]] tried converting Tucker to a [[switch hitter]] to start off the 1950 season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Boudreau Joins Hank In Picking Redskins|first=Ed|last=McAuley|work=The Sporting News|date=March 15, 1950|page=7}}</ref> Tucker was again set to be a backup outfielder in 1950.

Tucker and Allie Clark were both looking to crack the Indians roster to begin the 1951 season, as the additions of [[Harry Simpson]] and [[Minnie Mi<U+00F1>oso]] made it likely that one or both of them would be traded or released.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=u39gAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9HINAAAAIBAJ&pg=1794,938400|title=Cleveland's Pennant Hopes Dim for '51|first=Milton|last=Hichman|work=[[Greensburg Daily Tribune]]|date=April 10, 1951|page=25}}</ref> Tucker ended up playing only one game for the Indians on April 29, recording a strikeout in his lone at-bat.<ref name=br/> In early May, the Indians sent him to their [[Minor_league_baseball#Triple-A|Triple-A minor league affiliate]], the [[San Diego Padres (PCL)|San Diego Padres]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]], a move that ended his major league career.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AEJQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wQsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4656,6048662|title=Padres Get Tucker|work=Eugene Register-Guard|page=8|date=May 8, 1951}}</ref>

==Later life==
After being sent to the Padres, Tucker completed the 1951 season with them. In 88 games, Tucker had two triples and a .222 batting average.<ref name=brm/> In the offseason, Tucker began to operate a taxicab in Texas, and he contemplated retirement from baseball during a contract in February 1952.<ref>{{cite news|title=Padre Thurman Tucker May Quit Baseball|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 27, 1952|page=C2}}</ref> He did end up playing 47 games for the now-unaffiliated Padres, hitting .225 in the process.<ref name=brm/> In mid-June, the Padres sold his contract to the [[Oklahoma City Indians]] of the [[Texas League]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sedgman, Rose in Tennis Finals|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 21, 1952|page=B2}}</ref> Tucker played in 72 games for the Indians that season, hitting .263.<ref name=brm/> He retired from baseball during the 1953 season, and did not play with any professional team during that time.

Tucker returned to baseball in 1954 to play for the [[Lubbock Hubbers]] of the [[West Texas-New Mexico League]].
