==Background==
[[The Boat Race]] is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] competition between the [[University of Oxford]] (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues")<ref name=blues>{{Cite web | url = http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/06/theobserver | work = [[The Observer]] | title = Dark Blues aim to punch above their weight | date = 6 April 2003 | accessdate = 24 August 2014 }}</ref> and the [[University of Cambridge]] (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues").<ref name=blues/>  The race was first held in 1829, and since 1845 has taken place on the {{convert|4.2|mi|km|adj=on}} [[The Championship Course|Championship Course]] on the [[River Thames]] in southwest London.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/10719622/University-Boat-Race-2014-spectators-guide.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 24 August 2014 | date = 25 March 2014 |title = University Boat Race 2014: spectators' guide | first = Oliver |last =Smith}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/the-course | title = The Course| accessdate = 20 August 2014 | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited}}</ref>  The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities, followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news|title=Former Winnipegger in winning Oxford&ndash;Cambridge Boat Race crew|date=6 April 2014|publisher=[[CBC News]]|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/former-winnipegger-in-winning-oxford-cambridge-boat-race-crew-1.2600176|accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/tv-and-radio | title = TV and radio | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | accessdate = 24 August 2014}}</ref>  Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions, having won the [[The Boat Race 1962|previous year's race]] by five lengths, and led overall in the event with 60 victories to Oxford's 47 (excluding the "dead heat" of 1877).<ref>{{Cite web | url= http://theboatraces.org/classic-moments-the-1877-dead-heat | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Classic moments <U+2013> the 1877 dead heat | accessdate = 12 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=results>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/results| publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Boat Race <U+2013> Results| accessdate = 10 October 2014}}</ref>

Cambridge's coaches were Harry Almond (who rowed for Cambridge in the [[The Boat Race 1950|1950]] and [[The Boat Race 1951|1951 races]]), [[Tony Butcher]] (who rowed in the [[The Boat Race 1947|1947 race]] for Cambridge), [[David Jennens]] (who rowed three times between 1949 and 1951) and [[Charles Lloyd (rower)|Charles Lloyd]] (who also rowed three times from 1949 to 1951). Oxford were coached by R. M. A. Bourne (who represented Oxford in the [[The Boat Race 1946|1946]] and 1947 races), Ronnie Howard (who rowed twice, in the [[The Boat Race 1957|1957]] and [[The Boat Race 1959|1959 races]]), Mike Nicholson (the non-rowing boat club president of Cambridge in 1947), [[Antony Rowe]] (who had rowed in the [[The Boat Race 1948|1948]] and [[The Boat Race 1949|1949 races]]) and E. R. Spencer.<ref>Burnell, pp. 110&ndash;111</ref>  During practice rows at Putney, Cambridge experienced a number of "[[catch a crab|crabs]]" and while the crew demonstrated a "nervous disability to cope with rough water", they had the quicker start.<ref name=boil/>

The race was umpired by [[Gerald Ellison]], [[Bishop of Chester]], who had rowed for Oxford in the [[The Boat Race 1932|1932]] and [[The Boat Race 1933|1933 races]].<ref>Burnell, pp. 49, 74</ref>

==Crews==
The Oxford crew weighed an average of 13&nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 0.125&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (82.4&nbsp;kg), over {{convert|5.5|lb|kg|1}} per rower more than their opponents.  Cambridge's crew contained just a single rower with Boat Race experience in the boat club president and [[Stroke (rowing)|stroke]] [[James Waldegrave, 13th Earl Waldegrave|Lord Chewton]], while Oxford saw Richard Morton, David Skailes and [[Coxswain (rowing)|cox]] Christopher Strong return.<ref name=dodd340>Dodd, p. 340</ref>  Four rowers, two from each university, were registered as overseas participants in the race: Oxford's Philip Roff was Australian while D. Spencer was American, and Cambridge's B. Jackson was South African while John Haasland hailed from New Zealand.<ref>Burnell, p. 39</ref>  Oxford's [[Oxford University Boat Club|boat club]] president Toby Tennant had removed himself from the crew two weeks prior to the race as a result of a lack of form.<ref>{{Cite book | title = True Blue: The Oxford Boat Race Mutiny | first = Daniel | last = Topolski | authorlink=Daniel Topolski | first2=Patrick | last2=Robinson| page = | date = |isbn= |publisher = }}</ref>

A correspondant for ''The Times'' noted that although there "has never been the slightest possibility" that the Cambridge crew would be of "really first rate", the hard work had produced a "presentable University crew".<ref name=boil>{{Cite news | work = [[The Times]] | title = Cambridge "coming to the boil" | date = 23 March 1963 | issue = 55657 |}}</ref>  Meanwhile, although Oxford had "no stars" and had arrived at Putney as an "unusually backward crew", progress during practice made for definite improvement.<ref name=boil/>

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]] along which the Boat Race is contested]]
Oxford won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to Cambridge.<ref name=burn80>Burnell, p. 80</ref>  The race commenced at 11.30am in a "fresh north-north-westerly wind".<ref name=down>{{Cite news | title = Cambridge rowed down from behind | date = 25 March 1963 | work = [[The Times]] | issue = 55658}}</ref><ref name=burn80/>  As had been anticipated,<ref name=boil/> Cambridge took an early lead and were three-quarters of a length ahead after the first minute of the race.  Continuing at a higher [[stroke rate]] than Oxford in the second minute, the Light Blues were almost clear by the end of the Fulham Wall.  Still nearly a length behind by the Mile Post, Oxford cox Strong began to steer towards Cambridge, forcing them towards the centre of the river, narrowly avoiding a warning from the umpire.<ref name=handsome>{{Cite news | title = Oxford win handsomely and comfortably | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 25 March 1963 | page = 13}}</ref>  

Level by [[Harrods Furniture Depository]], Oxford were half a length up by [[Hammersmith Bridge]], increasing to over a length by The Doves [[pub]], despite an "almost despairing spurt" from Cambridge.<ref name=down/>  The lead was three and a half lengths by Chiswick Steps and four and a half by [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]].<ref name=handsome/>  Oxford won by five lengths in a time of 20 minutes 47 seconds, the slowest time since the [[The Boat Race 1951|1951 race]].  It was the Dark Blues' first victory in three years and took the overall record to 60&ndash;48 in Cambridge's favour.<ref name=results/>
