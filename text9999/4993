'''''Pseudaelurus''''' is a prehistoric [[Felidae|cat]] that lived in [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North America]] in the [[Miocene]] approximately 20-8 million years ago. It is an ancestor of today's [[Felinae|felines]] and [[Pantherinae|pantherines]] as well as the extinct [[Machairodontinae|machairodont saber-tooths]], and is a successor to ''[[Proailurus]]''. It originated from Eurasia and was the first [[felid]] to reach North America, when it entered the continent at about 18.5 m.y ending a '[[cat-gap]]' of 7 million years<ref>[[#Ted87|Tedford et al. 1987]]</ref><ref name="#Roth03|Rothwell 2003">[[#Roth03|Rothwell 2003]]</ref>. The slender proportions of the animal, together with its short, [[viverridae|viverrid]]-like legs, suggest that it may have been an agile climber of trees<ref>[[#Turn97|Turner 1997]]</ref>.

==Species and distribution==
===Europe===
The first and most primitive species ''Pseudaelurus turnauensis'' (=''Pseudaelurus transitorius'') from the early Miocene was about the size of a domestic cat and probably evolved directly from the Oligocene ''[[Proailurus]]''. The European ''Pseudaelurus turnauensis'' gave rise to additional species. ''Pseudaelurus lorteti'' was lynx-sized and the even larger ''Pseudaelurus quadridentatus'' weighed about 30&nbsp;kg and was approximately the size of a [[cougar]]. The latter showed a trend towards slightly enlarged upper canines, indicating that it gave rise to the later saber-toothed [[Machairodontinae|machairodontine]]s. Unexpectedly, the early ''Pseudaelurus turnauensis'' survived until 8 million years ago, at which time it is recorded in Germany, whereas the more derived ''Pseudaelurus lorteti'' and ''Pseudaelurus quadridentatus'' died out 2 million years earlier<ref>[[#Aug02|Augusti 2002]]</ref>. A fourth European species is described as ''Pseudaelurus romieviensis'', smaller than ''P. quadridentatus'' but larger than ''P. lorteti''<ref name="#Roth03|Rothwell 2003"/>.

===Africa and Asia===
''P. turnauensis'' is also recorded from the early Miocene Africa ([[Saudi Arabia]]). ''P. lorteti'' is also recognized from the middle Miocene of Asia ([[Jiangsu]], China), where two additional species, ''Pseudaelurus guangheensis'' from the middle Miocene of [[Gansu]] (China) and ''Pseudaelurus cuspidatus'' from the middle Miocene of [[Xinjiang]] (China) are reported<ref name="#Roth03|Rothwell 2003"/>.
===North America===
''Pseudaelurus intrepidus'' from the Early to Late [[Miocene|Barstovian]] of North America was a relatively large species, overlapping in size with the European ''P. quadridentatus''. A second large North American species from the Early and Late Barstovian was ''Pseudaelurus marshi''. ''Pseudaelurus stouti'' (originally described as ''[[Lynx]] stouti'') also from the Early and Late Barstovian  was a very small and slender from of the genus. ''Pseudaelurus aeluroides'' with only a type specimen from Early Barstovian from Nebraska is not well studied, but may be conspecific with ''P. marshi''. A species ''Pseudaelurus validus'', from the late [[Miocene|Hemingfordian]] of New Mexico was described in 2001. This species overlaps in size with ''P. intrepidus'', ''P. marshi'' and ''P. quadridentatus''<ref>[[#Roth01|Rothwell 2001]]</ref>. Recently (2003) an additional North American species ''Pseudaelurus skinneri'' from the Late Hemingfordian of Nebraska was described. This species is smaller than ''P. validus'' and overlaps in size with the Eurasian species ''P. lorteti'', ''P. cuspidatus'' and ''p. guangheensis''<ref name="#Roth03|Rothwell 2003"/>.
