'''''The Bellingham Herald''''' is the only daily newspaper published in [[Bellingham, Washington]], in the [[United States]].  It is currently owned by [[The McClatchy Company]].

==History==
''The Bellingham Herald'' began publication on March 10, 1890 as the tri-weekly ''Fairhaven Herald''. ''The Herald'' went through many changes in its early years, including temporary suspension and a merger with a competing weekly. In 1900, the newspaper purchased the first linotype on the West Coast.  When neighboring communities of [[Sehome]], [[Whatcom County|Whatcom]] and [[Fairhaven, Washington|Fairhaven]] consolidated into the city of Bellingham in 1903, the paper was first printed as ''The Bellingham Herald''. 

There were many who filled the roles of publisher and editor over the years but perhaps the most notable was the Sefrit-Carver team under the ownership of Sidney Albert "Sam" Perkins, which began in 1911 and lasted into the 1950s.  [[Federated Publications]] bought ''The Herald'' in 1967. In 1971 Federated Publications merged with [[Gannett Corporation]].  ''The Herald'' switched to morning delivery in May 1997. [[Knight Ridder]] acquired ''The Bellingham Herald'' in 2005.  Knight Ridder was purchased by McClatchy in 2006. On September 23, 2010 Mark Owings was named the new Publisher of the Herald. Owings had been Finance Director since 2004 and a Herald employee for 12 years before being named to his new position.

==The Herald Building==

The Herald Building is centrally located in downtown Bellingham on the corner of State and Chestnut Street. The building, built in 1926 as an eight-story office building, houses ''The Bellingham Herald'''s main offices on the first and second floors. Tenant businesses occupy the upper floors.  The lit sign on top of the Herald was used as a navigation aid for many years for sailors.  Morse Hardware had a similar sign saying "MORSE" on top of it for decades - and boaters would use the two signs at night for navigation.
