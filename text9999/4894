Contested by twelve national teams, the tournament had [[Zambia national football team|Zambia]] invited as a guest nation to fill in for [[Djibouti national football team|Djibouti]], who failed to participate for a second consecutive year. This followed the tournament's recent tradition of inviting other African nations to take part once a CECAFA nation pulled out; [[Malawi national football team|Malawi]] were invited to take part in the [[2012 CECAFA Cup|previous edition]] held in [[Uganda]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nyasatimes.com/malawi/2012/11/06/malawi-officially-invited-to-cecafa-cup-in-uganda/ |title=Malawi official invited to CECAFA Cup in Uganda |work=[[Nyasa Times]] |author=Elijah Phimbi |date=6 November 2012 |accessdate=6 November 2012 }}</ref> while they and [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]] took part in [[2011 CECAFA Cup|2011]] after [[Eritrea national football team|Eritrea]] withdrew from the competition.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.herald.co.zw/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=26733:warriors-get-cecafa-invitation&catid=50:sport&Itemid=142 |title=Warriors get Cecafa invitation |author=Grace Chingoma |work=The Herald |location=Zimbabwe |date=16 November 2011 |accessdate=20 November 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.starafrica.com/en/football/news/article/view/zimbabwe-replaces-namibia-for-cecafa-cup-204789.html |title=Zimbabwe replaces Namibia for CECAFA Cup |publisher=Star Africa |date=25 November 2011 |accessdate=25 November 2011 }}</ref>
