R. Ross Holloway (born August 15, 1934) is an American archaeologist, founder of the independent center for Mediterranean archaeology at Brown University, and the Elisha Benjamin Andrews Professor Emeritus of Brown University, where he taught from 1964 to his retirement in 2006.

== Biography and education ==

Holloway graduated from the [[Roxbury Latin School]] and [[Amherst College]] (summa cum laude).  He took his Ph.D. at Princeton University.

== Academic Career ==

Holloway joined  Brown Unviersity in 1964, and rose to become the Elisha Benjamin Andrews Professor Emeritus at his retirement. 
His research interests include Greek and Roman numismatics, Greek art and architecture, the archaeology of ancient Rome and the history of the Early Roman Republic.  

Throughout his career, Holloway has rejected the belief that archaeology is primarily to be used to support early published histories.  It is to be used, instead, to develop and write history, history that may or may not accord with the literary history.  As one reviewer of his work on early Rome and Latium, writes
:[t]he reader will find out that this "archaeological history" of the ''primordia'' has scarcely any links with the records of Livy and of Dionysius of Halicarnassus. The "traditionalists", i.e. the ones who systematically and excessively interpret archaeological discoveries in full confidence of the global historicity of ancient records, might be somewhat upset, but in the field of history too, a face to face confrontation with the truth is much more advisable.<ref>Poucet, Jacques, Bryn Mawr Classical Review 95.03.08, http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/1995/95.03.08.html, </ref> 
Another reviewer of his work on Constantine similarly indicated that this study of Constantine was based on a body of evidence different from the traditional studies based on textual research.
:Who was Constantine? A religious opportunist? A benevolent but autocratic patron of Christianity? An intolerant despot? All these characterizations have been cogently proposed on the basis of scholarly analysis of documentary evidence and the sifting of historical data derived from textual research. This new book looks at a different body of evidence and captures the character of the man and his era from another angle<U+2014>the buildings and monuments he erected in the city of Rome. <ref> Jensen, Robin Margaret, ''Journal of Early Christian Studies,'' vol. 13, no. 3, Fall 2005: 403-405. </ref> 

His field work has centered on sites in Italy and Sicily, particularly of the Early and Middle Bronze Age.  The radiocarbon dates obtained from these excavations led to a shift of almost half a millennium in Early Bronze Age chronology in this area, while the study of the Early Bronze Age blades from Buccino (Salerno) was one of the first to document the use of arsenic as a hardening agent in the early phases of bronze metallurgy.<ref>Buccino, The Eneolithic Necropolis of San Antonio and Other Prehistoric Discoveries made by Brown University in 1968 and 1969, De Luca (Rome) 1973.</ref>   On the island of Ustica (40 nautical miles north of Palermo) his excavation of the citadel boasting the most perfectly preserved fortifications of the Bronze Age in Italy or Sicily discovered the first evidence of native stone sculpture in the same area.<ref>Ustica II, The Results of the Excavations of the Regione Siciliana, Soprintendenza ai Beni Culturali ed Ambientali Provincia di Palermo in collaboration with Brown University in 1994 and 1999, with Susan S. Lukesh.  Archaeologia Transatlantica XIX (Providence) 2001.</ref>  And at site of La Muculufa, Butera (slightly inland from the south coast of Sicily) he discovered a federal sanctuary of the Early Bronze Age, the first such to be documented.<ref>La Muculufa, The Early Bronze Age Sanctuary: The Early Bronze Age Village (Excavations of 1982 and 1983), with M. S. Joukowsky, J. L<U+00E9>on and S. S. Lukesh (Providence and Louvain) 1990.</ref>  

A Festschrift was published in his honor in 2009.  The editor's preface summarizes his career: :
:Holloway's recognition of the significance of traditionally underappreciated indigenous cultures within the wider milieu of trans-Italian and trans-Mediterranean contact has provided a framework within which many later studies have been situated (e.g., the contributions by Hussein, Tsakirgis, and McConnell in this volume). Today, such thinking is central to innumerable discussions of economic, demographic and social complexity of the Mediterranean. And yet, the very ubiquity of this approach today underscores its profound and revolutionary impact at a time when the idea of the classical world was far more narrowly defined than it is now. <ref> Count, Derek and Anthony Tuck, <U+201C>Excavating the Labyrinth: An Archaeology of a Career," in Derek B. Counts and Anthony S. Tuck, eds., ''Koine, Mediterranean Studies in Honor of R. Ross Holloway,'' (Joukowsky Institute Publication 1), Oxford and Oakville, 2009: xxii. </ref> The introduction went on to say that his study of numismatics 
:has stressed [as well] both the skill of numismatic craft and the achievement of the craftsman for objects cast aside as mass produced and thus unable to speak to the individual. <ref> Count, Derek and Anthony Tuck, <U+201C>Excavating the Labyrinth: An Archaeology of a Career, <U+201C> in Derek B. Counts and Anthony S. Tuck, eds., Koine, Mediterranean Studies in Honor of R. Ross Holloway, (Joukowsky Institute Publication 1), Oxford and Oakville, 2009: xxiii. </ref>

In his academic career at Brown Holloway was instrumental in creating an independent home for the archaeology of the classical lands of the Mediterranean in the Center for Old World Archaeology and Art (COWA), now succeeded by the [[Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World]]. In 1981, together with Prof. Tony Hackens of the Catholic University of Louvain (Belgium), he founded the series Archaeologia Transatlantica which reached 22 volumes.  This was replaced in 2009, at Brown by, the Joukowsky Institute Publications.

Holloway received the Gold Medal of the [[Archaeological Institute of America]] in 1995, <ref>http://www.archaeological.org/rrossholloway%E2%80%941995goldmedalawarddistinguishedarchaeologicalachievement</ref>

He  holds honorary doctorates from Amherst and the [[Catholic University of Louvain]] and is a Corresponding Member of the [[German Archaeological Institute]],an  Honorary Member of the Royal Belgian Numismatic Society, Fellow of the [[Royal Numismatic Society]] (London), Fellow of the [[American Academy in Rome]], Foreign Member of the Italian Institute of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Studies (Florence), Foreign Member of the National Institute of Italic and Etruscan Studies (Florence).
