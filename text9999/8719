'''''As the Eternal Cowboy''''' is the second full length release from the [[punk rock]] band [[Against Me!]]. It is their debut release for [[Fat Wreck|Fat Wreck Chords]]. The decision make to jump from [[No Idea Records]] to Fat Wreck caused the band to alienate some fans, many of whom accused the band of losing their [[DIY]] ethics. This release was also characterized by controversy due to its production; some regarded it as sterile, polished, and uncomplimentary to otherwise good songs, despite the fact that the band kept the same producer that they used during the recording of 2002's [[Reinventing Axl Rose]]. In terms of songwriting, Gabel himself (the key songwriter on this record) has described it as being "more punk" than previous efforts. The song structure shows a move away from the large, anthemic choruses that drove much of the previous LP.

On this recording, and every recording since, Against Me! is Tom Gabel, Warren Oakes, James Bowman, and Andrew Seward.
