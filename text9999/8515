'''''A Different Kind of Truth''''' is the twelfth studio album by American [[hard rock]] band [[Van Halen]]. Released on February 7, 2012, ''A Different Kind of Truth'' is Van Halen's first full-length, studio album to feature original lead vocalist [[David Lee Roth]] since 1984, and also it is the band's first LP release since 1998. It is also the band's first album outside [[Warner Bros. Records]], being released by  [[Interscope Records]], and their first studio album not to include original bassist [[Michael Anthony (musician)|Michael Anthony]], with the bass guitar being handled by  [[Wolfgang Van Halen]], the son of guitarist [[Eddie Van Halen]] and actress [[Valerie Bertinelli]]. Produced by [[John Shanks]] (notable for producing [[Fleetwood Mac]], among other artists) and Van Halen, ''A Different Kind of Truth'' debuted at #2 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s U.S. Album Charts.

==Background==
In 2007, [[Van Halen]] reunited with original singer [[David Lee Roth]], who had left the band in 1985, for a [[Van Halen 2007<U+2013>2008 North American Tour|tour in North America]], which would also add as the bassist [[Wolfgang Van Halen]], son of guitarist [[Eddie Van Halen]]. The tour, which lasted for 74 shows between September 2007 and June 2008, was critically and commercially successful, earning over $93 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/06/06/music-vanhalen-dc-idUSN0540815520080606|title=Van Halen reunion grosses more than $93 million|author=Dean Goodman|date=2008-06-05|accessdate=2013-02-22}}</ref> While in 2009 Eddie declared in an interview that "we might not record something new" due to the new songs recorded for the 2004 compilation ''[[The Best of Both Worlds (Van Halen album)|Best of Both Worlds]]'' being ignored by fans and critics alike, and the possible frustration of "record[ing] a new album when people are only going to complain about it or ignore it or somebody is going to download it from the internet for free",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/tony-iommi-and-eddie-van-halen-cast-giant-shadow?page=0,4|title=Tony Iommi and Eddie Van Halen: Cast a Giant Shadow
|date=03/03/2010|wokr=Guitar World|author=Chris Gill|accessdate=2013-02-22}}</ref> the guitarist eventually decided that "we<U+2019>re doing this for us, too", particularly as Wolfgang was enthusiastic about creating a Van Halen record. In 2010, Eddie, Wolfgang and [[Alex Van Halen]] started [[jam session]]s at Eddie's own [[5150 Studios]], and later went through the band's archives, where Wolfgang picked out demos and unused tunes. Three songs, "She's the Woman", <U+201C>Bullethead<U+201D> and <U+201C>Let<U+2019>s Get Rockin<U+2019><U+201D> - later renamed <U+201C>Outta Space<U+201D> - were reworked, recorded and sent to Roth, who enjoyed the songs and decided to join the project.<ref name=evh>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/interview-eddie-van-halen-talks-different-kind-truth|title=Interview: Eddie Van Halen Talks 'A Different Kind of Truth'|work=[[Guitar World]]|date=2012-08-30|accessdate=2013-02-13 |author=Gill, Chris}}</ref>

Wolfgang<U+2019>s original idea for the album was to be a collection of B-sides along with three reworked songs, showcasing hardcore songs such as <U+201C>Drop Dead Legs<U+201D> and <U+201C>Girl Gone Bad<U+201D>. Eventually the band found more songs to work on at the archive, and Eddie begun composing new tracks, with the band ending up recording demos for 35 songs. After much deliberation on a self-production or picking an outside producer out of a list that included [[Rick Rubin]] and [[Patrick Leonard|Pat Leonard]], Roth suggested [[John Shanks]], whom he met at [[Henson Recording Studios]]. Shanks liked the first three songs, and then agreed to work on the album, working along with Wolfgang to pick the demos that would be developed into the album's tracks.<ref name=evh/> While all of Van Halen's albums since ''[[1984 (Van Halen album)|1984]]'' were produced inside 5150, [[David Lee Roth]] convinced the band to work in Henson Recording Studios, where he had been recording for over a decade.<ref name=sos/>

==Production==
In mid-January 2011, the band moved into Henson studios with Shanks, staff engineer Martin Cooke, and engineer Paul David Hager.<ref name=sos/> The band would work twelve hours a day, five days a week, working on the music during the afternoon and Roth coming in to sing at night.<ref name=shanks>http://www.guitarworld.com/interview-john-shanks-discusses-producing-van-halens-new-album-different-kind-truth</ref> The instrumental tracks were done in three weeks, with the band playing live as they had had much rehearsal, with Eddie declaring that "we made a few nips and tucks here and there, but everything was pretty much there." Wolfgang was a instrumental part of production, with his father consulting him as much as Shanks, and the bassist creating a new [[break (music)|breakdown]] on "She's the Woman" - as the original ended up used on ''[[Fair Warning (Van Halen album)|Fair Warning]]''{{'}}s (1981) "Mean Street" - and an arrangement for "Stay Frosty" outside the acoustic introduction.<ref name=evh/> By the end of March 2011, the band had returned to finish the record at 5150 with engineer Ross Hogarth.<ref name=sos/> Most of the work at 5150 was for guitars and bass, as Eddie "couldn<U+2019>t hear them at Henson the way I<U+2019>m used to" and both him and Hogarth felt the attempts at mixing were not progressing due to sound quality. Eddie attributed this to the tape machines at Henson, stating that on that studio "everything ended up sounding like it had a sock over it", a problem that did not repeat when playing the tapes at Eddie's facility.<ref name=evh/>

The final mix took place over a period of six weeks in the summer of 2011. Each song would be mixed for an entire day, and in the next day it would be tweaked. Hogarth declared that because the process was done at a [[mixing console]], "we couldn<U+2019>t move on to the next song until a mix had been approved by everyone and could go off the desk." Hogarth started with the drums as he considered it the most important about a rock band, and then moved forward with the bass and guitar to finish a [[backing track]], which would be complemented with multing (hiving off different sections of a given part to different tracks) and [[parallel compression]]. Then it was finished bringing in Roth<U+2019>s vocals, backing vocals, and details like ad libs, screams and solos.<ref name=sos/>

Hogarth aimed "to bring Ed<U+2019>s guitar sound into the modern era, but maintaining all the DNA of the past." He suggested to Eddie that instead of doing again the guitar to the left speaker and the effects [[Panning (audio)|panned]] to the right, the guitar sound was split naturally instead of electronically using two [[guitar amplifier]]s place far apart. The idea was to have a guitar sound "that was wide and mono, and not digital [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]]-driven, and it<U+2019>s what you hear on the record, with only a few overdubs <U+2014> the classic Van Halen sound is not to have a rhythm guitar when he solos". A more complex structure was made for [[Wolfgang Van Halen]]'s bass, as the band wanted "a bass sound that covered the whole spectrum, from high to low and clean to dirty", and up to eight microphones recorded his instrument. A multi-mic set-up was also employed for [[Alex Van Halen]]'s drums, with most of the final drumming coming from overhead microphones Hogarth dubbed "[[press conference]]". Roth's vocals were all recorded at Henson, without compression.<ref name=sos/>

The songs on ''A Different Kind of Truth'' were described by Roth as "a sort of collaboration with [Van Halen's] past."<ref name=latimesinterview>{{cite web |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/29/entertainment/la-ca-vanhalen-20120129/2 |title=When David Lee Roth talks, it's 'A Different Kind of Truth' &#124; Los Angeles Times |first=Geoff |last=Boucher |work=latimes.com |accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref> Seven tracks that appear on the album are based on material which Roth notes, "Eddie and I generated, literally, in 1975, 1976, and 1977",<ref name=latimesinterview/> and Eddie added that "I wrote some of those songs when I was still in high school and even junior high."<ref name=evh/> 1970's recordings exist of what became "She's the Woman", "Outta Space", "Big River", "Beats Workin'", "Tattoo", and "Bullethead".<ref name="vhnd.com">http://www.vhnd.com/2012/02/07/van-halen-a-different-kind-of-truth-the-vhnd-review/</ref> 

With the exception of "She<U+2019>s The Woman" and "Bullethead", Roth rewrote the lyrics for the other tracks, putting a point of view coming from his present personal life.<ref name=sos>http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may12/articles/it-0512.htm</ref> Roth declared that "All music is autobiographic. Particularly when it<U+2019>s not meant to be.<U+201D>, adding that by retooling the songs "there is a body of new that meets halfway there, that I think makes very colourful sense."<ref>http://www.torontosun.com/2012/02/02/unchained-the-david-lee-roth-interview</ref>

Lyrical themes on the album are diverse; however, a majority of songs deal with cyclical successes, failures, and fate, in an intricate but generally tongue-in-cheek style.<ref>http://www.vhnd.com/2012/03/22/help-ive-fallen-for-van-halen-and-cant-get-up/</ref> Such lyrical themes are present on "She's the Woman", "China Town", "Blood and Fire", "Bullethead", "As Is", "The Trouble with Never", "Stay Frosty", and "Beats Workin'".

Only lead single "Tattoo" contains a [[synthesizer]], played by Roth. Two songs, "You And Your Blues" and "As Is", have a processed guitar that sounds  like a synth.<ref name=sos/> Roth also performs the acoustic guitar on the intro for "Stay Frosty".<ref name=evh/>

Portions of the song "Blood and Fire" date back to 1984 when it was an instrumental known as "Ripley", which was featured in the 1984 film ''The Wild Life''.<ref name="vhnd.com"/>
Five songs on ''A Different Kind of Truth'' are brand new Van Halen compositions though the main riff for As Is was jammed by Eddie Van Halen at the 2003 Namm trade show. "Stay Frosty" and "You and Your Blues" feature both musical and lyrical nods to the blues.

This release is the first Roth-fronted Van Halen studio album not to include an instrumental as a stand-alone track.

==Release and packaging==
Van Halen had left label [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 2002,<ref> http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/77007/van-halen-splits-with-warner-bros</ref> though the band signed a one-record deal with them afterwards in 2004 to release ''The Best of Both Worlds''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Everybody Wants Some: The Van Halen Saga|author=Christe, Ian |page=271|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2009|ISBN=0470536187}}</ref> For ''A Different Kind of Truth'', [[Columbia Records]] negotiated with the band but the deal stalled as Roth did not want to sign with the label. [[Interscope Records]] chairman [[Jimmy Iovine]] intervened, and managed to sign Van Halen into his company.<ref>http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/van-halen-sign-to-interscope-reports-20111114</ref> 

''A Different Kind of Truth'' was released on February 7, 2012, in both a regular CD and a deluxe version containing a bonus Acoustic DVD called ''The Downtown Sessions'', which contains acoustic versions of "Panama", "You and Your Blues" and "Beautiful Girls".<ref>http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=168011</ref> [[Walmart]] also had a special version bundling a T-shirt along with the CD,<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=242850&l=de6e51ffc5&id=128624973906287 Exclusive Van Halen CD + T-Shirt Bundle (Limited Edition) at your local Walmart - while supplies last.]</ref> and [[Live Nation Entertainment]] sold online a double gatefold vinyl album that came along wih the deluxe MP3 edition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.store.livenation.com/Product.aspx?cp=13281_16771_54521&pc=XM03COMBO |title=A Different Kind of Truth: Vinyl Tour Collector's Edition|publisher=[[Live Nation]] Store |accessdate=2012-01-16}}</ref>

The [[cover artwork]] was designed by Los Angeles-based Smog Design, following a concept sent by Roth. The steam locomotive featured is a [[New York Central Railroad]] [[NYC Hudson|J-3A Dreyfuss Hudson]], photographed by 
Robert Yarnall Richie.
