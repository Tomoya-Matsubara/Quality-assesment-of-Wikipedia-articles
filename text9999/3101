The '''2015 Football League Cup Final''' was a [[association football|football]] match that took place on 1 March 2015<ref>{{cite web|title=Competition Round and Draw Dates|url=http://www.capitalonecup.co.uk/fixtures-results/competition-round-dates/|publisher=Capital One Cup|accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref> at [[Wembley Stadium]], London.

It was contested by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in a repeat of the [[2008 Football League Cup Final]], which the latter team won.<ref name=live>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/football/30765878 |title=Sheffield Utd v Tottenham & Atletico v Barcelona |publisher=BBC Sport |date= |accessdate=2015-01-28}}</ref> Chelsea won 2<U+2013>0 in the 2015 final, with a goal from captain [[John Terry]] at the end of the first half, and a second from an [[own goal]] by [[Kyle Walker]], who deflected in a [[Diego Costa]] shot in the 56th minute. It was Chelsea's fifth League Cup win, and their first silverware in the second managerial spell of [[Jos<U+00E9> Mourinho]] at the club.

Mourinho expressed delight in winning another trophy in his career, while Terry spoke of optimism for Chelsea's future prospects. Tottenham manager [[Mauricio Pochettino]] declared pride in his side despite their defeat.

Chelsea, of the [[Premier League]], began their League Cup campaign in the third round, where they were drawn at home against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] of the [[Football League Championship|Championship]]. Defender [[Kurt Zouma]], making his debut, opened the scoring, but Bolton equalised six minutes later through a [[Matt Mills]] header. Ten minutes after the start of the second half, Oscar put Chelsea back into the lead and they won 2<U+2013>1, dominating the match with 28 shots to Bolton's 3.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chelsea 2<U+2013>1 Bolton|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29233095|accessdate=27 December 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=24 September 2014}}</ref>

In the fourth round, Chelsea travelled to the [[New Meadow]] to face [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] of [[Football League Two|League Two]]. Three minutes after play resumed from a goalless first half, [[Didier Drogba]]'s half-volley gave Chelsea the lead, but Shrewsbury gained an equaliser from substitute [[Andy Mangan]]. With nine minutes to play, Chelsea regained the advantage when Shrewsbury defender [[Jermaine Grandison]] deflected a shot from [[Willian (footballer)|Willian]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chowdhury|first1=Saj|title=Shrewsbury 1<U+2013>2 Chelsea|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29699744|accessdate=27 December 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=28 October 2014}}</ref>

Chelsea again were the away team to a lower opponent in the quarter-finals, facing [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] of the [[Football League Championship|Championship]]. In the first half, [[Eden Hazard]] gave Chelsea the lead, later doubled by a [[Filipe Lu<U+00ED>s]] free kick, the full-back's first for Chelsea. [[Craig Bryson]] halved the deficit for Derby, but soon afterwards defender [[Jake Buxton]] was sent off for a foul on [[Lo<U+00EF>c R<U+00E9>my]] and [[Andr<U+00E9> Sch<U+00FC>rrle]] scored the final goal of a 3<U+2013>1 Chelsea win.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Whalley|first1=Mike|title=Derby 1<U+2013>3 Chelsea|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30390347|accessdate=27 December 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=16 December 2014}}</ref> In the semi-final, Chelsea beat [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] 2<U+2013>1 on aggregate after [[Branislav Ivanovi<U+0107>]] scored the winning goal in the first half of extra time in the second leg, heading in Willian's free kick.<ref>{{cite news |first=Henry |last=Winter |title=Branislav Ivanovi<U+0107> scores extra-time winner to seal feisty semi-final win |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/league-cup/11373050/Chelsea-1-Liverpool-0-2-1-on-agg-Branislav-Ivanovic-scores-extra-time-winner-to-seal-feisty-semi-final-win.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=27 January 2015 |accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref>

===Tottenham Hotspur===

Tottenham, also of the Premier League, began by facing [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] at [[White Hart Lane]]. After a goalless first half, [[Jorge Grant]] gave the visitors from the Championship the lead in the 65th minute. Substitute [[Ryan Mason]] equalised six minutes later, and Spurs eventually won 3<U+2013>1 after two late goals from [[Roberto Soldado]] and another substitute, [[Harry Kane]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Tottenham 3-1 Nottm Forest|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29233056|accessdate=27 December 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=24 September 2014}}</ref>

Tottenham hosted another second-tier opponent in the fourth round, [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], and went into the lead through [[<U+00C9>rik Lamela]], a half-time replacement for [[Aaron Lennon]]. Kane later confirmed a 2<U+2013>0 victory.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tottenham 2-0 Brighton|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29718447|accessdate=27 December 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=29 October 2014}}</ref>

In the quarter-finals, Tottenham again played at home, against top-flight [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. Away goalkeeper [[Jak Alnwick]] made a mistake which allowed [[Nabil Bentaleb]] to give Spurs a half-time lead. [[Nacer Chadli]] doubled it 36 seconds into the second half.

Tottenham were eliminated from the last 32 of the [[UEFA Europa League]] by [[Fiorentina]] three days before the final, leading manager [[Mauricio Pochettino]] to say that the team needed to recover quickly.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mauricio Pochettino: Tottenham must recover for League Cup final|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31653527|accessdate=27 February 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=26 February 2015}}</ref>

Chelsea manager [[Jos<U+00E9> Mourinho]] used his pre-match interview to state that his previous wins in the tournament had changed the way that clubs approach the League Cup: "Lots of teams have followed us since then when we took the League Cup as a real competition, as a real challenge. It is a big competition".<ref name=mourinho/> He separated the final from the league season, saying "I don't think if we win the cup final we will win the league, or if we lose it we will lose the league".<ref name=mourinho/> He refused to discuss the suspension of Mati<U+0107>, dismissing it with "If I speak to you about that, I promise you I will be in big trouble".<ref name=mourinho/> Despite opining that the two teams and the match officials would act fairly, he criticised players who dive, despite not naming any names.<ref name=mourinho>{{cite news|title=Jose Mourinho: Chelsea manager values importance of League Cup|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31658657|accessdate=1 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=1 March 2015}}</ref> Mourinho also claimed that in after leaving Chelsea for the first time in September 2007, he was approached to manage Tottenham by chairman [[Daniel Levy (businessman)|Daniel Levy]], and again in 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chelsea v Tottenham: Spurs wanted me as boss - Mourinho|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31677132|accessdate=2 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=1 March 2015}}</ref>

===Summary===
[[File:Chelsea 2 Spurs 0 Capital One Cup winners 2015 (16693380295).jpg|thumb|left|[[C<U+00E9>sar Azpilicueta]] returning to the pitch after treatment for a head injury]]
In the 10th minute, [[Christian Eriksen]] had the first meaningful shot, hitting the crossbar with a 25-yard free kick for Tottenham. Twenty minutes later, [[Eric Dier]] was given the game's first [[Penalty card#yellow card|yellow card]] for a foul on [[Diego Costa]]. At the end of the first half, Chelsea won a free kick on their right side when [[Branislav Ivanovi<U+0107>]] was pulled down by [[Nacer Chadli]]. [[Willian (footballer)|Willian]] took the free kick, which arrived at [[Kurt Zouma]], played it down to captain [[John Terry]]. Terry's shot <U+2013> Chelsea's first on target <U+2013> went past [[Hugo Lloris]] due to a deflection by Dier. In added time at the end of the first half, [[Gary Cahill]] had a header from a corner, which was caught by Lloris.<ref name=guard>{{cite news |first=Jacob |last=Steinberg |title=Chelsea 2 Spurs 0 |url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/mar/01/chelsea-v-tottenham-hotspur-capital-one-cup-final-live |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=1 March 2015 |accessdate=2 March 2015 }}</ref>

Neither side made a substitution at half time. In the 56th minute, [[Cesc F<U+00E0>bregas]] <U+2013> who had a [[bicycle kick]] saved by Lloris <U+2013> set up [[Diego Costa]], whose shot from the left of the area deflected off Tottenham right-back [[Kyle Walker]] and into the net to double Chelsea's advantage.<ref name=report>{{cite news |title=Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31572594 |work=BBC Sport |date=1 March 2015 |accessdate=1 March 2015 }}</ref> After conceding their second goal, Tottenham made a series of attacking substitutions <U+2013> [[Andros Townsend]], [[Ryan Mason]] and Chadli made way for [[Mousa Demb<U+00E9>l<U+00E9> (footballer, born 1987)|Mousa Demb<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>]], [[Erik Lamela]] and [[Roberto Soldado]] respectively <U+2013> but could not change the score. In the 74th minute, Dier's knee caught [[C<U+00E9>sar Azpilicueta]], drawing blood; the Chelsea left-back left the pitch to be bandaged and returned two minutes later. There were four minutes of added time, in which Chelsea substituted Costa for [[Didier Drogba]].<ref name=guard/>
