The '''Lebanon hostage crisis''' refers to the systematic kidnapping in [[Lebanon]] of 96 foreign hostages of 21 national origins  between 1982 and 1992. The victims were mostly from Western countries, and mostly journalists, diplomats, or teachers.   25 of them were Americans, 16 were Frenchmen, 12 Britons, 7 Swiss and 7 West Germans. <ref>source: Maskit Burgin, `Foreign Hostages in Lebanon` in Ariel Merai and Anat Kurz, International Terrorism in 1987 (Boulder, CO, Westview Press, 1988), p.70</ref> <REF>Hala Jaber, a journalist for British newspapers estimates at least 87 foreigners were kidnapped, including 17 Americans, 14 Britons, 15 French, 7 Swiss and 7 West Germans. (Jaber, Hala.  ''Hezbollah : born with a vengeance'', New York : Columbia University Press, c1997, p.113)</ref>  At least 10 hostages perished in captivity: some murdered and others died from lack of adequate medical attention to illnesses. <ref>Jaber, Hala.  ''Hezbollah : born with a vengeance'', New York : Columbia University Press, c1997, p.113</ref>

Those taking credit for the kidnapping used different names -- [[Islamic Jihad]], [[Organization for the Defense of Free People]], [[Organization for the Oppressed of the Earth]], [[Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine]], etc. -- but the testimony of former hostages indicates almost all the "groups" were actually one group of "a dozen men" came "from various ... clans" within the [[Hezbollah]] organization, "most notably the Mughniyya and Hamadi clans." <ref>''Los Angeles Times'', 26 November 1989; ''Independent'', 9 October 1991; and ''Le Figaro'', 4 December 1989</ref> Particularly important in the organization was "master terrorist" [[Imad Mughniyah]].<ref>Wright, Robin, ''Sacred Rage,'' 2001, p.270</ref>  Hezbollah has publicly denied involvement.<ref>"Talks in Iran Seek to Free Hostages," ''New York Times,'' March 17, 1991, p.18</ref>[[Image:mugniyah.PNG|thumb|right|100px|Imad Mughniyah]]   It is also widely believed that the Islamic Republic of [[Iran]] and to a lesser extent [[Syria]] played a major role in the kidnappings. <ref>Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon'', (1997)p.108</ref>

The original reason for the hostage-taking seems to have been "as insurance against retaliation by the U.S., Syria or any other force" against Hezbollah, which is thought responsible for the killing of 230 Americans<ref>Rise to Globalism by Stephen Ambrose (page 312)p</ref> in the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|Marine barracks]] and [[April 1983 United States Embassy bombing|embassy bombing]]s in [[Beirut]]. <ref>Explained by PLO's Salah Khalef, in ''Washington Post'', 21 February 1987</ref> Other reasons for the kidnappings or the prolonged holding of hostages are thought to be "primarily based on Iranian foreign policy calculations and interests" particularly the extraction of "political, military and financial concessions from the Western world," <ref>Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah'' (1997), p.54</ref> the hostage takers being strong allies of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]].

The tight security measures taken by the hostage-keepers succeeded in preventing not only Western sources but even Syrian intelligence (which helped the Western countries at times) from locating and rescuing all but a handful of hostages. <ref>Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah'' (1997) p.147</ref> Frustration with the situation, along with public pressure from the media and families of the hostages led to a breakdown of the anti-terrorism principle of "no negotiations, no concessions" by American and French officials. In particular the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration in the United States negotiated a secret and illegal arms for hostage swap with Iran known as the [[Iran-Contra Affair]]. 

The hostage crisis ended with the need for Western aid and investment by Syria and Iran following the end of the [[Iran-Iraq war]] and collapse of the Soviet Union, and with the promises to Hezbollah that would could remain armed following the end of the Lebanese Civil War and that France and America would not seek revenge against it.  <ref>Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon'', (1997), p.125</ref> 

==Events==
*[[TWA Flight 847]].  One of the most dramatic hostage-takings in Lebanon occurred on June 14, 1985, when TWA Flight 847 from Athens to Rome was hijacked by "Organization for the Oppressed of the Earth."  Passengers underwent a three-day, {{convert|8300|mi|km|sing=on}} ordeal shuttling back and forth between Beirut and Algiers.  Groups of passengers were freed over the course of event. One passenger, a U.S. Navy diver, [[Robert Dean Stethem]], was beaten, shot and his body dumped on the runway. Another 39 passengers were held hostage in the South Beirut for two weeks, as Lebanese army troops withdrew from the Beirut airport on June 16th leaving Hezbollah and Amal militias to control the area and hold the hostages. On June 30, they were driven to Syria and released.  The liberation of the hostages was followed over the next several weeks by the release of 735 Lebanese Shiite militants by Israel. Although this was one of the key demands of the hijackers, Israel maintaining the release was unconnected to the hijacking. <ref name="country-data">[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-8105.html Lebanon, the hostage crisis]</ref>

==Victims==
With the exception of a few hostages such as CIA Bureau Chief William Francis Buckley and Marine Colonel William Higgins, (who were both killed) most of the hostages were chosen not for any political activity or alleged misdeeds they had committed, but because of the country they came from and the ease of kidnapping them. Despite this, they were often treated quite cruelly, with repeated beatings and mock executions.<ref>"Terry Anderson Looks Back, Blindfold and Chains" ''New York Times'', March 15, 1992, p.10</ref>

Some of the more famous victims include:
*[[David S. Dodge]]. Perhaps the first victim whose case was widely publicized was [[American University of Beirut]] president David Dodge, abducted 19 July 1982 and freed in July 21, 1983. According to Lebanese journalist Hala Jaber, "Dodge was abducted initially by pro-Palestinian Lebanese" in hopes of pressuring the Americans to pressure Israel which had invaded Lebanon to stop Lebanon-based [[PLO]] attacks. After the PLO evacuated Lebanon, "the Iranians had taken charge of" Dodge and moved him from Beqaa valley to Tehran.  The Iranians hoped to use Dodge to gain the release of three Iranian officials who had been kidnapped by Christian militia Lebanese Forces in July 1982.<ref>Jaber, Hala.  ''Hezbollah : born with a vengeance'',  New York : Columbia University Press, c1997, p.100</ref>   

:Dodge "spent the next three months in the infamous Evin jail, where the [[Iranian Revolutionary Guard]] had executed hundreds of the Shah's followers in the wake of Khomeini's Islamic Revolution. Whenever he was interrogated, he was asked for information about the missing Iranians."<ref>Jaber, Hala.  ''Hezbollah : born with a vengeance'',  New York : Columbia University Press, c1997, p.100</ref>  

:Dodge was released on the first anniversary of his abduction, reportedly because Syrian President Assad was "enraged by Iran's role in the abduction". Dodge "was taken out of his cell, given back the clothes he had worn on the day of his abduction, and driven back to the airport by an official of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. From there he flew first class to Syria. ... At Damascus airport his escort handed him over to a waiting car ... the following morning he was handed over to the American embassy." <ref>''Hostage: Complete Story of the Lebanon Captives '' by Con Coughlin, Time Warner, pp.36</ref>

*[[Benjamin Weir]]. The Presbyterian minister was kidnapped in May 1984 by three armed men while strolling with his wife.  Weir may have thought he was safe from harm from Muslims because he lived in Shiite West Beirut working "closely with various Muslim-oriented charity and relief groups," and had lived in Lebanon since 1958.  Two days after his abduction, a telephone message claimed: "Islamic Jihad organization claims it is responsible for the abduction  ... in order to renew our acceptance of Reagan's challenge [to fight "state terrorism"] and to confirm our commitment of the statement ... that we will not leave any American on Lebanese soil." <ref>Wright, Robin, ''Sacred Rage'', Simon and Schuster, 2001, p.101,2,4</ref> He was released mid-September 1985.

*[[Terry A. Anderson]], chief Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press, was the best known, and longest held, hostage believed to be captured by Shiite Hezbollah or Islamic Jihad Organization Anderson, was seized on March 16, 1985, finally being released December 4, 1991 <ref name="country-data"/>

*[[Rudolph Cordes]] and [[Alfred Schmidt]], two citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) abducted in January 1987 by an organization calling itself "Strugglers for Freedom." The West Germans were seized shortly after the West German government arrested [[Muhammad Ali Hamadi]], a Shia terrorist leader who allegedly masterminded the 1985 [[TWA Flight 847]] hijacking and killed diver [[Robert Dean Stethem]].  Muhammad Ali Hammadi was not released at that time but was in 2006, "in an apparent exchange for a German hostage in Iraq."<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/09/opinion/main1190219.shtml Justice Will Be Done]</ref> 

[[Image:Terry Waite April 1993.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Terry Waite]] 
*[[Terry Waite]]. Anglican Church envoy [[Terry Waite]], who disappeared January 20, 1987, while on a negotiating mission to free the other kidnap victims, spent almost five years in captivity, nearly four years of it in solitary confinement, after he was seized by Islamic Jihad from a go-between's house in Lebanon on January 20, 1987. Before his release in November 1991 he was frequently blindfolded, beaten, and subjected to mock executions. He lived much of the time chained to a radiator, suffered desperately from asthma, and was transported in a giant refrigerator as his captors moved him about. <ref>Galenet Biography Resource Center</ref>

===Killed=== 
*[[William Francis Buckley]]. Former CIA Bureau Chief, Beirut, taken hostage by Islamic Jihad, Mar 16, 1984.<ref>Galenet Biography Resource Center</ref> and held at the village of Ras al-Ein.<ref>[http://www.jeffreygoldberg.net/articles/tny/a_reporter_at_large_in_the_par.php In The Party Of God (Part I)]</ref> On October 3, 1985, the Islamic Jihad Organization claimed to have killed him. The Islamic Jihad Organization later released to a Beirut newspaper a photograph purporting to depict his corpse. Press reports stated that Buckley had been transferred to Iran, where he was tortured and killed.  The National Security Council, however, believes Buckley died of poor treatment and from a pneumonia-like illness, probably on June 3, 1985.<ref>US Security Council, "U.S./Iranian Contacts and the American Hostages" -"Maximum Version" of NSC Chronology of Events, dated November 17, 1986, 2000 Hours - Top Secret, Chronology, November 17, 1986, 12 pp. (UNCLASSIFIED)

*Four [[Soviet]] diplomats were kidnapped on September 30, 1985. [[Arkady Katkov]], a consular attach<U+00E9>, was killed by his captors; the other three (Oleg Spirin, Valery Mirikov, and Nikolai Svirsky) were released a month later. <ref name="country-data"/>

*[[Michel Seurat]]. On February 10, 1986, the Islamic Jihad Organization released a photograph that claimed to show the body of French sociologist Michel Seurat, who had been kidnapped earlier.  On 5 March 1986 Islamic Jihad claimed it had executed the French hostage Michel Seurat. His fellow hostages revealed on their release that Seurat had died of hepatitis. <ref>Jaber, Hala.  ''Hezbollah : born with a vengeance'', New York : Columbia University Press, c1997, p.126</ref>

*[[Peter Kilburn]], [[John Douglas]] and [[Philip Padfield]]. On April 17, 1986, the bodies of these three American University of Beirut employees, American citizen Peter Kilburn and Britons John Douglas and Philip Padfield, were discovered near Beirut.  The Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Muslims claimed to have "executed" the three men in retaliation for the United States air raid on Libya on April 15, 1986.<ref name="country-data"/>

[[Image:HigginsWilliamR USMC.jpg|right|thumb|100px|William R. Higgins, USMC]]
*Another American military man killed by Hezbollah abductors was [[William R. Higgins]]. He was captured and taken hostage while serving on a United Nations (UN) peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon. A year and a half after his capture, a videotape was released by his captors showing his body hanging by the neck.  on December 23, 1991, his body was recovered from a Beirut street where it had been dumped.  

===Escaped or rescued===
*[[Frank Regier]]. American citizen Frank Regier, engineering professor at the American University of Beirut, was kidnapped in Feb. 1984 when he walked off the campus grounds. He was freed after several months in captivity by [[Amal]] militiamen, who raided the Beirut hideout of his extremist captors on April 15, 1984. Islamic Jihad responded by threatening Amal. <ref>Wright, Robin, ''Sacred Rage'', Simon and Schuster, 2001, p.102, 4</ref> 

*[[Jeremy Levin]]. On February 14, 1985, American journalist Jeremy Levin escaped from his captors in the [[Beqaa Valley]]. Shia militants claimed they had allowed him to escape and the U.S. publicly thanked Syria for intervening on his behalf. <ref>Wright, Robin, ''Sacred Rage'', Simon and Schuster, 2001, p.102</ref> 

*[[Michel Brillant]]. On April 11, 1986, French captive Michel Brillant escaped several days after his abduction when his captors were surprised by a party of hunters in the Beqaa Valley.<ref name="country-data"/>

*[[Jean-Marc Sroussi]]  several days later (from September 26, 1986) French television correspondent Jean-Marc Sroussi escaped from a locked shed days after his capture. <ref name="country-data"/>

==Perpetrators==
Many other "groups" claimed responsibility for the kidnappings while [[Hezbollah]] denied it, indignantly proclaiming in 1987: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>We look with ridicule at the accusations of Hezbollah in connection with the abductions of foreign hostages. We consider that is a provocation and hold America responsible for the results. <Ref>''New York Times, `Militia leaders report the arrest of Waite`, February 3, 1987, p. A3</ref></BLOCKQUOTE> 

Nonetheless Hezbollah, sometimes described as the "umbrella group" of Shia radicalism in Lebanon, is considered by most observers to be the instigator of the crisis. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Analysis of the hostage-crisis in Lebanon yields that Hezbollah was undisputably responsible for the aforementioned abductions of Westerners despite attempts to shield its complicity through the employment of cover-names. Its organisational framework was not only sophisticated an assimilated according to Iranian clerical designs but also closely integrated with several key Iranian institutions which provided it with both necessary weaponry and training to successfully confront self-proclaimed Islamic enemies and invaluable financial support ... <ref>Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon'', (1997)p.108</ref></BLOCKQUOTE> 

Another source claims that with the exceptions of six Iranians, all the hostages appear to have been seized by "groups allied with Iran."<ref>source: Maskit Burgin, `Foreign Hostages in Lebanon` in Anat Kurz, Ariel Merari, ''International Terrorism in 1987''(Boulder, CO, Westview Press, 1988), p.70</ref>   

The two main operatives of the hostage taking are reported to be: 

*[[Imad Mughniyah]], a senior member of the Hezbollah organization, has been described by journalist Robin Wright as the "master terrorist" who organized the campaign.<ref>Wright, Robin, ''Sacred Rage,'' 2001, p.270</ref>

*[[Husayn Al-Musawi]] (also spelled Hussayn al-Mussawi) is described by journalist Jeffrey Goldberg of [[The New Yorker]] magazine as involved in the kidnappings, and the village of Ras al-Ein, in the Beqaa Valley of East Lebanon as a place were the victims were held.<ref>[http://www.jeffreygoldberg.net/articles/tny/a_reporter_at_large_in_the_par.php In The Party Of God (Part I)]</ref>

==Motivations==
According to scholar Gilles Kepel "a few of the kidnappings were money-driven or linked to local concerns, but most obeyed a logic whereby Hezbollah itself was no more than a subcontractor for Iranian intiatives." <ref>Kepel, ''Jihad'' (2002), p.129</ref>
Motivation for the hostage-taking includes:
*[I]nsurance "against retaliation by the U.S., Syria or any other force" against Hezbollah,  for the killing of over 300 Americans in the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|Marine barracks]] and [[April 1983 United States Embassy bombing|embassy bombing]]s in [[Beirut]]. <ref>Explained by PLO's Salah Khalef, in ''Washington Post'', 21 February 1987</ref> 
*The release of three (or four) Iranian officials who had been kidnapped in July 5, 1982 by Christian militia [[Lebanese Forces]] (aka Phalangists) 25 miles north of Beirut. In December 1988, [[Hashemi Rafsanjani]] publicly addressed the Americans just before he was elected president of Iran: 
:<BLOCKQUOTE>If you are interested in having your people [who are] held hostage in Lebanon released, then tell the Phalangists [Christian militia] to release our people who have been in their hands for years. <ref>Jaber, Hala.  ''Hezbollah : born with a vengeance'', New York : Columbia University Press, c1997, p.100</ref></BLOCKQUOTE>

:The Iranians included Ahmad Motevaselian, the Ba'albek commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard contingent, and Mohsen Musavi, the Iranian charge d'affairs to Lebanon. <ref>''Middle East Reporter'', 22 July 1983, 14 November 1990</ref> (The other two Iranians were Akhaven Kazem and Taqi Rastegar Moqaddam.) 

*Pro-Palestinian Lebanese believed they could use the first American hostage, [[David Dodge]], "as a means of pressuring the American to do something about the [[1982 Lebanon War|Israeli invasion of Lebanon]] ..." <ref>Jaber, Hala.  ''Hezbollah : born with a vengeance'', New York : Columbia University Press, c1997, p.101</ref></BLOCKQUOTE> 

*Legendary Lebanese [[Hezbollah]] terrorist [[Imad Mughniyah]] wanted to free his cousin, brother-in-law Mustafa Badreddin, one of the "Kuwait 17" (the 17 imprisoned perpetrators of the [[1983 Kuwait Bombing]]).<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r101:S25JY0-B485: Bombs, Hostages: A Family Link], Washington Post, July 24, 1990.</ref>  
:The hostage in captivity the longest, Terry Anderson, was told that he and the other hostages had been abducted to gain the freedom of their seventeen comrades in Kuwait convicted of perpetrating the [[1983 Kuwait Bombing]] of six key foreign and Kuwaiti installations,  "what might have been the worst terrorist attack of the century had the bombs' rigging not been faulty." <ref>Jaber, Hala.  ''Hezbollah : born with a vengeance'', New York : Columbia University Press, c1997, p.127-9</ref>

*Another of the Kuwait 17, Hussein al-Sayed Yousef al-Musawi, was the first-cousin to [[Husayn Al-Musawi]], leader of Islamic Amal, a sister militia to [[Hezbollah]] that was later merged with Hezbollah.<ref>Ranstorp, , ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon'', (1997), p.91</ref> 

*Islamist Shia wanted to use French hostages to free [[Annis Naccache]], who was the leader of the Iranian backed assassination team attempting to kill former Iranian Premier [[Shapour Bakhtiar]].   Naccache was a Christian Lebanese who had converted to Islam and pledged allegiance to Khomeini following the success of the revolution. He was a "close personal friend" of "Ahmad Khomeini, son of the Iranian revolutionary" leader, "Mohasen Rafiqust, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp commander in Lebanon," and of the aforementioned Hezbollah operative Imad Mughniya.<ref>Ranstorp, , ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon'', (1997), p.95</ref>   They appear to have been completely successful in their efforts. 

:<BLOCKQUOTE>On 18 July 1980, Naccache was arrested for the attempted to kill Bakhtiar.   A gendarme and a bystander were killed in the subsequent battle with the police. Naccache and three others were given life sentences ... Naccache's release later became a condition for freeing the Western hostages in Lebanon.<ref>Jaber, Hala.  ''Hezbollah : born with a vengeance'', New York : Columbia University Press, c1997, p.127</ref></BLOCKQUOTE>  Naccache was freed "on 27 July 1990, together with four accomplices, after being pardoned by President [[Francois Mitterand]]. All five men were put on a plane bound for [[Tehran]]. The deal also brought political, military and financial benefits to Iran itself: the release of its frozen assets and desperately needed spare parts for their armaments. The French also kicked out most of the Iranian opposition leaders who had taken sanctuary in their country following the revolution." 

:French hostages were released by kidnappers at the same time. France denied reports that they had made a deal. <ref>Jaber, Hala.  ''Hezbollah : born with a vengeance'', New York : Columbia University Press, c1997, p.127</ref></BLOCKQUOTE>

==Resolution==
By 1991 radical Shia operatives imprisoned in Europe had been freed.  Islamic Dawa party members convicted of terrorism in Kuwait had been freed by Iraqi Invasion. There was no need to pressure Western supporters of the Iraq because Iran-Iraq War was over. It was pretty well established that the four missing Iranians were no longer alive. <ref>"Hostages Fate Linked to Four Missing Iranians," ''New York Times'', November 23, 1990, p. A11</ref> 

More importantly Iran was in need of foreign investment "to repair its economy and infrastructure after the destruction of the Iran-Iraq War, and Syria needed to "consolidation of its hegemony over Lebanon" and obtain to Western aid to compensate for the loss of Soviet support following the collapse of the Soviet Union.<ref>Ranstorp, , ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon'', (1997), p.125</ref> Syria was actively pressuring Hezbollah to stop the abductions and a February 1987 attack by Syrian troops in Beirut that killed 23 members of Hezbollah was in part an expression of Syrian irritation with the continued hostage-taking. <ref>Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon'', (1997) p.100</ref>  Hezbollah had guarantees from Syria that despite the end of the [[Lebanese Civil War]], it would be allowed to remain armed, while all other Lebanese militias would be disarmed, on the grounds that Hezbollah needed its weapons to fight Israeli occupation in the South.  <ref>Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon'', (1997), p.191</ref>  

This combination of factors created a setting whereby UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar and his personal envoy, Giandomenico Picco (served on the Board of Governmental Relations for the [[American Iranian Council]]), could negotiate "a comprehensive resolution to the hostage-crisis." Hezbollah by December 1991, Hezbollah had released the last hostage in return for Israel's release of imprisoned Shi'ites.<ref>Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon'', (1997), p.167</ref>
