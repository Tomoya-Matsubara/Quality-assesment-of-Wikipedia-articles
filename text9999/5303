The '''Drengots''' were a [[Normans|Norman]] family of mercenaries, one of the first to head to the [[Mezzogiorno]] of [[Italy]] to fight in the service of the [[Lombards]]. They became the most prominent family after the [[Hauteville family|Hautevilles]]. 

==Origins==
The family came from in [[Carreaux]], near [[Avesnes-en-Bray]], east of [[Rouen]]. From ''Quarrelis'' or ''Quadrellis'', the Latin for Carreaux, the family gets its alternate name of "de Quarrel." Some sources, however, place the family's origins in [[Alen<U+00E7>on]]. 

The first members of the family known are five brothers. Four of these accompanied their one exiled brother, [[Osmond Drengot|Osmond]], who had murdered one of Duke [[Richard I of Normandy]]'s hunting companions. Sources diverge as to just who among the brothers was leader on the trip to the south. [[Orderic Vitalis]] and [[William of Jumi<U+00E8>ges]] name Osmond. [[Ralph Glaber]] names [[Ralph Drengot|Rudolph]]. [[Leo of Ostia]], [[Amatus of Montecassino]], and [[Adhemar of Chabannes]] name [[Gilbert Buat<U+00E8>re]]. According to most south Italian sources, this last was designated leader for the [[Battle of Cannae (1018)|Battle of Cannae]] in 1018.<ref>Chalandon, p 52.</ref> The remaining brothers were [[Asclettin of Acerenza|Asclettin]] and [[Rainulf Drengot|Ranulf]], probably the younger sons. Some sources, like Glaber, claim that the band of 250 Norman warriors stopped in [[Rome]] to meet [[Pope Benedict VIII]]. They then moved on to one of the Lombard capitals: [[Salerno]] or [[Capua]]. From there they joined with [[Melus of Bari]], the leader of the Lombard rebels in [[Apulia]].

==Rise==
The Drengot Normans were successful with Melus until their defeat at Cannae in 1018. After that the [[Emperor Henry II]] came down in 1022 and pacified the region, maintaining the ''status quo ante'' between Greek and Lombard, he donated to a nephew of Melus some land in the county of [[Comino]], in the valley of the [[Garigliano]]. This nephew of Melus brought with him many of the Norman mercenaries, including the Drengots, excepting Rudolph, who returned with some men to Normandy. 

The Drengots did not rise to great heights under the elder sons, Gilbert dying at Cannae and Rudolph returning to France. It was the young, but ruthless, Ranulf who brought them to great heights. He happily employed his men in support of the ousted [[duke of Naples]], [[Sergius IV of Naples|Sergius IV]], in 1029. When Sergius returned to power, he gave Ranulf not only his sister in marriage,<ref>Norwich. Chalandon, p 77. This sister is identified as the recent widow of the [[List of Hypati and Dukes of Gaeta|count of Gaeta]] by Amatus, but which "count" of Gaeta is unclear. The then-reigning Duke [[John V of Gaeta]] was the son of Sergius' other sister.</ref> but also the town and environs of [[Aversa]]. Ranulf immediately took to fortifying the hilltop town and the first Norman state in Italy was born. 

In 1042, Asclettin, who had thrown his lot in with the Hautevilles, was granted [[Acerenza]] in a twelvefold division of the conquest in Apulia. 

==Rule in Capua==
By far the most significant event in the familial history of the Drengot clan was the conquest of the principality of Capua in 1058. In 1057, [[Pandulf VI of Capua|Pandulf VI]] died and [[Richard I of Capua|Richard]], the son of Asclettin, immediately besieged the city of Capua. It surrendered the next year, but Richard, though he took the princely title, left the city in the hands of its rightful prince, [[Landulf VIII of Capua|Landulf VIII]], until 1062. 

Richard also established his suzerainty over [[Gaeta]] in 1058 and sent his son, [[Jordan I of Capua|Jordan]], to take possession of the city in 1062, though this wasn't accomplished until 1064. Richard and Jordan worked to expand Drengot power to the north, in [[Latium]] and the [[Abruzzi]]. They formed the only counter to the power of the Hauteville, then conquereing [[Calabria]] and [[Sicily]]. The papacy thus turned to the princes of Capua to defend them and Richard and Jordan became popemakers: they imposed, by military force, the papal candidates of [[Pope Gregory VII|Hildebrand]] and the [[Gregorian Reforms|Reformers]]. In 1077, Richard, then the equal of [[Robert Guiscard]], began to besiege [[Naples]], but died in 1078. Jordan did not continue the siege, but during his reign, the Drengot influence declined in proportion to that of the Hautevilles, who finished their conquests in Sicily and the expulsion of the Greeks from the peninsula. 

From 1092 to 1098, the Drengots were expelled from Capua by the Lombard citizenry. After their reinstallation, the dynasty declined more and more in relative power. They still attempted to defend the papacy, but to little success. They were forced to make submission to the [[duke of Apulia]] and then the [[king of Sicily]]. [[Robert II of Capua]] revolted against the latter and spent his life trying, with the aid of Emperor and Pope, to retake his principality, but to no avail. He died in 1156 and the Drengot power was completely broken.
