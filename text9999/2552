In his first critically successful film role, Nichols starred as a stereotypical, basketball-playing [[Fraternities and sororities|"frat boy"]] in  ''[[The Utopian Society]]'', a 2003 independent film directed by John P.

===Box office and critical success===
In 2004, Nichols was cast as J.D., an intelligent rich kid and romantic rival to [[Jake Gyllenhaal]]'s main character in the environmental blockbuster, ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]''. The science and script were generally panned by critics, and cast performances criticized.<ref>[http://www.oneguysopinion.com/Guys/fswietek.htm Swietek, Frank.] [http://www.oneguysopinion.com/Review.php?ID=1291 Day After Tomorrow, The.] oneguysopinion.com.

After this success, Nichols co-starred in a pilot for ''1/4 life'', a TV series about [[Twentysomething (term)|20 somethings]] living in New York which was not developed by a television network.
