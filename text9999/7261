The '''Peru national football team''' has represented [[Peru]] in international [[Association football|football]] since 1927. Organised by the [[Peruvian Football Federation]] (FPF),{{efn-ua|The acronym FPF comes from the organisation's Spanish name, ''Federaci<U+00F3>n Peruana de Futbol''.}} it is one of the 10 members of [[FIFA]]'s South American Football Confederation ([[CONMEBOL]]). The Peruvian team's performance has been inconsistent; it enjoyed its most successful periods in the 1930s and the 1970s.{{sfn|Witzig|2006|p=349}} Managed by [[Pablo Bengoechea]], it plays most of its home matches at the [[Estadio Nacional (Lima)|Estadio Nacional]] in [[Lima]], the country's capital.

The Peru national team has won the [[Copa Am<U+00E9>rica]] [[Peru at the Copa Am<U+00E9>rica|twice]] and qualified for [[FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup finals]] [[Peru at the FIFA World Cup|four times]]; it also [[Peru at the Olympics|participated]] in the [[Football at the 1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympic football competition]].

The white and red colours, the country's national colours, give rise to the side's common Spanish nickname, ''la Blanquirroja'' ("the white-and-red").<ref name="Arkivperu.com, ''La Blanquiroja''"/>

Peru took part in the inaugural FIFA World Cup in 1930 and enjoyed victories in the [[1938 Bolivarian Games]] and the [[1939 South American Championship|1939 Copa Am<U+00E9>rica]], with goalkeeper [[Juan Valdivieso]] and forwards [[Teodoro Fern<U+00E1>ndez]] and [[Alejandro Villanueva]] playing important roles. Peruvian football's successful period in the 1970s brought it worldwide recognition; the team then included the formidable forward partnership of [[Hugo Sotil]] and [[Te<U+00F3>filo Cubillas]], often regarded as Peru's greatest player, and defender [[H<U+00E9>ctor Chumpitaz]].<ref name="FIFA Peru">{{cite web|title=Peru|publisher=FIFA | url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminaries/southamerica/teams/team=43929/profile.html | accessdate=28 June 2013}}</ref> This team qualified for three World Cups and won the [[1975 Copa Am<U+00E9>rica|Copa Am<U+00E9>rica in 1975]].

The Peruvian team last reached the World Cup finals [[1982 FIFA World Cup|in 1982]]; it has since failed to qualify, and has not won any major tournament. FIFA temporarily suspended the country from international competition in late 2008 during the Peruvian government's investigations into alleged corruption within the FPF. Peru came third at the [[2011 Copa Am<U+00E9>rica]], but failed to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] in Brazil.

The sport became a popular daily activity in Lima [[barrio]]s, encouraged by bosses who hoped that it would breed solidarity and improved productivity among their workers.{{sfn|Jacobsen|2008|p=378}} In the adjacent port of [[Callao]] and other commercial areas, British civilian workers and sailors played the sport among themselves and with locals.{{sfn|Henshaw|1979|p=571}}{{efn-ua|During these games in Callao, the Peruvians possibly invented the [[bicycle kick]], which is known in Peru as the ''chalaca'' (meaning "from Callao").{{sfn|DK Publishing|2011|p=100}}}} Sports rivalries between locals and foreigners arose in Callao, and between elites and workers in Lima.

The team then qualified for two consecutive World Cup tournaments: it reached the second round in [[1978 FIFA World Cup|Argentina 1978]], and was knocked out in the first group stage at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 tournament]] in Spain. Peru's early elimination in 1982 ended a period when the side's "flowing football was admired across the globe".{{sfn|DK Publishing|2010|p=75}}

Following the team's [[1986 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|failure to qualify]] for the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] in Mexico, renewed expectations for Peru were centred on a young generation of Alianza Lima players known colloquially as ''Los Potrillos'' ("The Colts").{{efn-ua|According to sociologists Aldo Panfichi and Victor Vich, ''Los Potrillos'' "became the hope of the entire country"<U+2014>Peru fans expected them to lead the country to qualification for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] in Italy.{{sfn|Panfichi|Vich|2005|pp=161, 173}} }} The team entered a hiatus after the [[1987 Alianza Lima air disaster|Alianza Lima air disaster]] of 8 December 1987, when a plane carrying most of Alianza's players and staff crashed into the Pacific Ocean.

Football has been the most popular sport in Peru since the early 20th century.{{sfn|Bravo|2012|p=42}} The sport was originally largely exclusive to Lima's [[Anglophile]] elite and expatriates, and secluded from the rest of the city,{{sfn|Wood|2007|p=128}} but it became an integral part of wider popular culture during the 1900s and 1910s. Augusto B. Legu<U+00ED>a's government institutionalised the sport into a national pastime over the following decades by promoting and organising its development.{{sfn|Wood|2007|pp=128<U+2013>129}}

Peruvian football fans are known for their distinctive chant ''<U+00A1>Arriba Per<U+00FA>!'' ("Come on Peru!"),{{sfn|Foley Gambetta|1983|p=12}} as well as for their use of traditional Peruvian ''[[m<U+00FA>sica criolla]]'' to express support, both at national team games and at club matches. ''M<U+00FA>sica criolla'' attained national and international recognition with the advent of [[mass media]] during the 1930s, becoming a widely recognised symbol of Peru and its culture.{{sfn|Wood|2007|p=130}} The national team's most popular anthem is ''[[Peru Campe<U+00F3>n]]'', a ''[[polca criolla]]'' (Peruvian polka) glorifying Peru's qualification for the Mexico 1970 World Cup.{{sfn|Wood|2007|p=130}}

The [[Estadio Nacional disaster]] of 24 May 1964, involving Peruvian supporters, is often cited as one of the worst tragedies in football history.<ref>See:
* {{harvnb|Snyder|2001|p=78}},
* {{harvnb|Goldblatt|2008|p=642}}.</ref> During a qualifying match for the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympics]] between Peru's under-20 team and its counterpart from Argentina, the Uruguayan referee Angel Payos disallowed a would-be Peruvian equaliser, alleging rough play. Spectators threw missiles from the stands while two fans invaded the pitch and attacked the referee. Police threw [[tear gas]] into the crowd, which caused a stampede; trying to escape, fans were crushed against the stadium's locked gates. A total of 315 people were killed in the chaos, with more than 500 others injured.<ref>See:

The rivalry between the Ecuador and Peru football teams is rooted in the historical [[History of the Ecuadorian<U+2013>Peruvian territorial dispute|border conflict]] between the countries dating back to the 19th century. In 1995, after the brief [[Cenepa War]], CONMEBOL contemplated altering [[1995 Copa Am<U+00E9>rica|that year's Copa Am<U+00E9>rica]] group stage to prevent a match between the two sides, but ultimately did not.{{sfn|Llopis|2009|p=171}} According to Michael Handelsman, Ecuadorian fans consider losses to Colombia or Peru "an excuse to lament Ecuador's inability to establish itself as an international soccer power".{{sfn|Handelsman|2000|p=49}} During the Brazil 2014 World Cup qualifiers, Ecuador's captain [[Walter Ayov<U+00ED>]] declared that "these matches have always had something additional, a thorough rivalry.

Cubillas, an attacking midfielder and forward popularly known as ''El Nene'' ("The Kid"), is widely regarded as Peru's greatest ever player.<ref>See:

Teodoro Fern<U+00E1>ndez, Alejandro Villanueva, and Juan Valdivieso are often regarded as the key members of the ''Rodillo Negro'' team of the 1930s.{{sfn|Witzig|2006|pp=131, 350, 486}} Fern<U+00E1>ndez was the team's forward and primary goalscorer; his partner in attack, Villanueva, was a gifted playmaker. Valdivieso was a goalkeeper with a reputation for exceptional athleticism who often saved [[penalty kick|penalties]].{{sfn|Witzig|2006|p=350}}

A commemorative match between teams representing [[Europe XI|Europe]] and [[South America XI|South America]] was organised in Basel, Switzerland for the benefit of homeless children in 1972. Cubillas, Chumpitaz, Sotil, and [[Julio Bayl<U+00F3>n]] played in the South American team, which won the game 2<U+2013>0; Cubillas scored the first goal.{{sfn|Henshaw|1979|p=143}} A similar match was held the next year at Barcelona's [[Camp Nou|Nou Camp]] with the declared intent of fighting global poverty; Cubillas, Chumpitaz and Sotil once again played, with Chumpitaz named South America's captain.
