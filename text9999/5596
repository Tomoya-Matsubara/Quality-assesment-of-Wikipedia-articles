'''King Alfred's Tower''', also known as '''The Folly of King Alfred the Great''' or '''Stourton Tower''', is a [[folly]] tower. It is in the parish of [[Brewham]] in the English county of [[Somerset]], and was built as part of the [[Stourhead]] estate and landscape. The tower stands on Kingsettle Hill and belongs to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. It is designated as a grade I [[Listed building (United Kingdom)|listed building]].

[[Henry Hoare]] II planned in the 1760s the tower to commemorate the end of the [[Seven Years' War]] against France and the accession of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] near the location of 'Egbert's stone' where it is believed that [[Alfred the Great]], [[List of monarchs of Wessex|King of Wessex]], rallied the [[Saxons]] in May 878 before the important [[Battle of Edington|Battle of Ethandun]]. It was damaged by a plane in 1944 and restored in the 1980s.

The {{convert|49|m|ft|0|adj=on}} high triangular tower has a hollow centre and is climbed by mean of a spiral staircase in one of the corner projections. It includes a statue of King Alfred and dedication inscription.

:''Alfred's Tower is a monument to the genius of English landscape, many of whose loveliest haunts it commands, and to a man who certainly deserves to be remembered as among the great benefactors of the English scene.'' - [[Christopher Hussey]], ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'', 11 June 1938.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hussey|first=Christopher|journal=Country Life|date=11 June 1938}}</ref>

In 1765 [[Henry Flitcroft]], a [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] architect, designed the tower.<ref name=towerinfo/> Building began in 1769 or early 1770, and was completed in 1772 at an estimated cost between <U+00A3>5,000 and <U+00A3>6,000.<ref name="holt"/> There may have been some delay due to difficulty in obtaining the bricks.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Woodbridge|first=Kenneth|title=Henry Hoare's Paradise|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=March 1965|volume=47|issue=1|page=109| jstor=3048235}}</ref> In addition to the commemorative function, the tower was also intended to serve as an eye-catching focus for those touring the parkland of the Stourhead Estate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stourhead park (part), Alfred's Tower, Brewham|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/HER/details.asp?prn=28626|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=15 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Kelsall|first=Malcolm|title=The Iconography of Stourhead|journal=Journal of the Warburg and Courthold Institutes|date=1983|volume=46|pages=133<U+2013>143|jstor=751117}}</ref> In April 1770, when the tower was just {{convert|4.7|m|ft|0}} high, Hoare is quoted as saying: 'I hope it will be finished in as happy Times to this Isle as Alfred finished his Life of Glory in then I shall depart in peace.'<ref>{{cite book|last=Lapidge|first=Michael|title=Anglo-Saxon England|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|pages=322|isbn=978-0-521-65203-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=wCPVQe8J5_MC&pg=PA322&lpg=PA322&dq='I+hope+it+will+be+finished+in+as+happy+Times+to+this+Isle+as+Alfred+finished+his+Life+of+Glory+in+then+I+shall+depart+in+peace}}</ref>

==Architecture==

The triangular tower is over {{convert|40|m|ft|0}} high with a girth of {{convert|51|m|ft|0}}. Each of the three corners of the triangular structure has a round projection.<ref name=nhle/> The centre of the tower is hollow and to stop birds from entering the space a mesh has been added at roof level. The viewing platform, which has a [[crenellation|crenellated]] [[parapet]] and offers a view over the surrounding countryside, is reached by a 205-step spiral staircase at the corner furthest from the entrance.<ref name=towerinfo/>  The brick tower has [[Chicksgrove Quarry|Chilmark stone]] dressings and is surmounted by an embattled parapet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alfred's Tower, Kingsettle Hill (South side), Brewham|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/HER/details.asp?prn=50734|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=15 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Alfred's Tower, Brewham|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/HER/details.asp?prn=55478|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=15 May 2014}}</ref>

The 'front' (south-east) face of the tower has a [[Ogive#Architecture|Gothic-arched]] entrance door, a statue of King Alfred, and a stone panel bearing an inscription (see below). This is the face that most visitors see first when walking from [[Stourhead]] garden or from the nearby car park.

Around the Stourhead estate are several inscriptions. The one on the tower was drafted in 1762 and installed in 1772.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=James|journal=The Art Bulletin|date= March 1979|volume=61|issue=1|pages=68<U+2013>77 | title=The Structure of Henry Hoare's Stourhead|jstor=3049865|doi=10.2307/3049865}}</ref> The stone tablet above the door on the east face of the tower reads:
