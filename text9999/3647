'''Millennium '73''' was a three-day festival held on November 8<U+2013>10, 1973 at the [[Astrodome]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], United States, by the [[Divine Light Mission]] (DLM). It featured [[Prem Rawat]], then known as Guru Maharaj Ji, a 15-year-old [[guru]] and the leader of a fast-growing [[new religious movement]].<ref>{{harvnb|Larson|1982| p=205}}</ref> Organizers billed the festival as the most significant event in [[human history]] which would usher in a thousand years of [[peace]].<ref name="Galanter1989p24">{{Harvnb|Galanter|1989|p=24}}</ref><ref name="Levine 1974">{{Harvnb|Levine|1974}}</ref>

The festival's official schedule described the three evening addresses by Guru Maharaj Ji as the highlights of the event.<ref name="And It Is Divine 1973"/> [[Big-band]] music, [[rock bands]], religious songs, [[choral]] works, a dance performance and speeches by other DLM leaders filled the program from noon to 10 pm. Media events included press conferences and an impromptu debate.

Millennium '73 received wide publicity. [[Rennie Davis]], a prominent [[anti-war movement|anti-war activist]] and member of the [[Chicago Seven]], helped draw attention to the event as a spokesman for the DLM. Notable journalists attended, some of them acquaintances of Davis from the [[New Left]]. It was later described by some scholars and journalists as among the major events of 1973 and the 1970s, the high point of Guru Maharaj Ji's popularity, and the most important development in the American DLM's history.

Attendance was estimated from 10,000 to 35,000, compared to the projected 100,000. Many scholars and journalists generally depicted the event as a disappointment. That, along with other factors including a large debt, led to changes in the DLM's structure, management and message. The following year the movement split into branches headed by Maharaj Ji in the West, and his mother and brother [[Satpal Maharaj|Bal Bhagwan Ji]] in India.

[[Hans Ji Maharaj]], who taught secret meditation techniques called "Knowledge",<ref>{{harvnb|Melton|1992|p=143}}</ref><ref name=Rawson>{{Harvnb|Rawson|1973}}</ref> founded the [[Divine Light Mission]] (DLM) in India in 1960. Hans Ji, called "Guru Maharaj Ji", died six years later and was succeeded as spiritual leader and Perfect Master by his eight-year old youngest son, who adopted his father's title. As the young Guru Maharaj Ji was a minor, his mother, Mata Ji, and the eldest son, Bal Bhagwan Ji, managed the DLM's affairs.<ref name="Downton1979ch12">{{harvnb|Downton|1979}}, ch. 12</ref><ref name="Geaves2006">{{harvnb|Geaves|2006}}</ref> By 1971, when the 13-year-old Guru Maharaj Ji made his first tours of the United Kingdom and United States, the Indian DLM claimed over five million members (known as "premies"). Within two years the DLM had as many as 50,000 members in the US, with thousands more in the UK and other countries and as many as six million in India.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rudin|Rudin|1980|p=63}}</ref> Most of the Western followers were young people from the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]].<ref>{{harvnb|Downton|1979|p=3}}</ref><ref name="Melton 1992">{{harvnb|Melton|1992|p=217}}</ref>

The DLM celebrated three annual festivals, the largest of which, "Hans Jayanti", commemorated Hans Ji Maharaj's birthday on November 9.<ref name="Melton 1986">{{Harvnb|Melton|1986|pp=141<U+2013>145}}</ref> The Hans Jayanti festivals held in India in the early 1970s were well-attended, attracting audiences of up to a million people, including Westerners.<ref name="Jeremy 1974">{{Harvnb|Jeremy|1974}}</ref><ref name=Mangalwadi219>{{Harvnb|Mangalwadi|1977|p=219}}</ref><ref name="Moritz 1974">{{Harvnb|Moritz|1974|pp=254<U+2013>258}}</ref> Mata Ji and the 22-year-old Bal Bhagwan Ji decided that the 1973 Hans Jayanti should be held in the United States; it was the first to be held outside India.<ref>{{Harvnb|Downton|1979|p=191}}</ref>

The movement invested all of its resources in the event,<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|1998|p=84}}</ref> with an overall budget of close to [[United States dollar|US$]]1,000,000,<ref name="Snell 1974">{{Harvnb|Snell|1974}}</ref> including $75,000 to rent the [[Astrodome]] and $100,000 for publicity.<ref name="Kilday 11/13/73">{{Harvnb|Kilday|1973b}}</ref> The DLM paid for many of the international charter flights that brought followers to Houston.<ref>{{Harvnb|Messer|1976|p=67}}</ref> DLM members were under pressure to contribute money to support the event.<ref name="MacKaye 1973">{{Harvnb|MacKaye|1973}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Collier|1978|p=133}}</ref> Organizers invited hundreds of reporters from all over the country, hoping to achieve positive media exposure for Maharaj Ji.<ref name ="Goldsmith 1974">{{Harvnb|Goldsmith|1974}}</ref><ref name="Downton">{{Harvnb|Downton|1979|p=5}}</ref><ref name="Winder & Horowitz 1973">{{Harvnb|Winder|Horowitz|1973}}</ref>

===Millenarian appeal===
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, many people in the US, especially [[hippie]]s, believed that the world was on the verge of a new era, the [[Age of Aquarius]]. This new age was expected to be characterized by peace and love, harmony and understanding.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tacey|2004|p=256}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rado|Ragni|1967}}</ref> By the late autumn of 1973 there was an "apocalyptic chill in the air", as headlines dealt with the [[Vietnam war]], the [[Watergate scandal]], the [[Spiro Agnew|Agnew]] resignation, [[Yom Kippur War|a war in the Middle East]], [[1973 oil crisis|an energy crisis]], mass murders in Houston and California, and [[UFO sightings]] across the South.<ref name="Levine 1974" />

Sociologist [[James V. Downton]] wrote that the [[millenarianism|millenarian]] appeal of the DLM prior to the festival sprang from a belief that Guru Maharaj Ji was the Lord, and that a new age of peace would begin under his leadership. These hopes appealed to the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture youth]] of the time, who were disillusioned with earlier attempts at political and cultural revolution and who were turning their aspirations in a spiritual direction. Downton describes these aspirations as encouraging millennial beliefs within the DLM, including the "psychological trappings of surrender and idealization." He states the guru's mother, whose ''[[satsang]]'' was "full of references to his divine nature", aided these beliefs, as did the guru himself, "for letting others cast him in the role of the Lord." Maharaj Ji's appeal to followers to give up beliefs and concepts did not prevent them "from adopting a fairly rigid set of ideas about his divinity and the coming of a new age."<ref name="Downton1979p199-200">{{Harvnb|Downton|1979|pp=199<U+2013>200}}</ref>

In a meeting with members, DLM President Bob Mishler denied that the event would start the millennium and said they called it "Millennium '73" because the word "[[millennium]]" evoked the "vision of one peaceful world based on spiritual values".<ref>{{Harvnb|Collier|1978|p=152}}</ref>

===Promotion===
The Mission's most prominent member was anti-war activist and [[Chicago Seven]] defendant [[Rennie Davis]], who had first met Guru Maharaj Ji in February 1973.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greenfield|1975|p=40}}</ref> Davis was appointed vice president of the organization a short time later and served as general coordinator for the Millennium festival.<ref name=Rawson/> His conversion was the topic of numerous newspaper articles, as it reportedly shook the [[New Left]] from coast to coast.<ref name="Kent 2001">{{Harvnb|Kent|2001|pp=48<U+2013>54}}</ref><ref name="Gray 1973">{{Harvnb|du Plessix Gray|1973}}</ref> An energetic promoter of his new guru and of Millennium '73, Davis traveled across the United States on a 21-city tour,<ref name="Greenfield 1975 p=41">{{Harvnb|Greenfield|1975|p=41}}</ref> speaking to what he said were about a million people a day through radio and television interviews.<ref name="Levine 1974"/> He told people that Guru Maharaj Ji was the solution to civilization's problems.<ref name="Levine 1974"/> Davis was not always well-received, particularly by his former comrades in the peace movement (one Berkeley newspaper had the headline "Rennie Unites Left&nbsp;<U+2013> Against Him"), and was heckled at some of his appearances.<ref name="Greenfield 1975 p=41"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Rose|1973}}, {{Harvnb|Strand|1973}}</ref> The Chicago Seven retrial was underway in the fall of 1973, and the judge gave Davis a dispensation to attend the festival.<ref name="Levine 1974"/> Several associates of Davis from the left also attended, some as journalists.<ref name="Webb 1973">{{Harvnb|Webb|1973}}</ref>

A two-week, eight-city, 500-person tour, called "Soul Rush", was organized to promote Millennium '73.<ref>{{Harvnb|Vidville Messenger staff|1973}}</ref> At a stop in [[Washington, D.C.]] premies (DLM members) gathered in front of the [[White House]] and invited President [[Richard Nixon]] to attend the festival and receive Knowledge.<ref name="Levine 1974"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Collier|1978|p=171}}</ref> One reporter for the ''[[Village Voice]]'' who traveled in the tour wrote that they had little press coverage and poor attendance but showed obvious energy, and that the tour itself went remarkably smoothly with expressions of love among the members.<ref name="Webb 1973"/> At each city, the touring group and local premies paraded in the morning, and a drama troupe performed in the afternoon.<ref>{{Harvnb|Collier|1978|pp=162, 170}}</ref> The main event was the free evening performance by "Blue Aquarius", a 50 to 60-piece band led by Bhole Ji, Maharaj Ji's 20-year-old brother, referred to as the "Lord of Music" by Davis and others.<ref>{{Harvnb|Top Value Television|1974}}, {{Harvnb|Greenfield|1975|p=69}}</ref> The band was composed of professional and amateur musicians who donated their efforts, and its leading member was drummer Geoff Bridgeford, formerly of the [[BeeGees]].<ref name="Levine 1974"/><ref name="Elman 1974"/> It went on to anchor the Houston festival.

Press releases and a festival poster announced that the event would mark the beginning of "a thousand years of peace for people who want peace",<ref name="Levine 1974"/><ref name="Moritz 1974"/> the idea being that peace could come to the world as individuals experienced inner peace.<ref name="Blau 1973"/> A flyer said, "Now the turning point in human civilization is here. ...

===Expectations and rumors===
Official DLM literature predicted the dawn of a new age of peace, the [[Age of Aquarius]], and some followers expected dramatic change or even the [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Jesus]].<ref name="Downton1979p6">{{Harvnb|Downton|1979|p=6}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Bromley|Shupe|1981|p=45}}</ref> In a letter to premies inviting them to attend the festival, Guru Maharaj Ji said, "This is a festival not for you or me.

Sociologist Thomas Pilarzyk wrote that devotees made "bizarre, 'cultic'" predictions, and suggested that their excitement validated the significance of the event.<ref name="Pilarzyk 1978"/> A member remarked that even normally realistic followers were swayed by the collective fantasies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Downton|1979|p=188}}</ref> [[Sophia Collier]], a teenaged member who later left the movement and published a memoir, said that a minority of members, mostly limited to Houston, became victims of a "Millennium Fever" promoted chiefly by Bal Bhagwan Ji.<ref>{{Harvnb|Collier| 1978| p=154}}</ref> The majority of the premies repeated Bal Bhagwan Ji's ideas out of astonishment, but some actually believed him.<ref name=Miller>{{Harvnb|Miller| 1995|pp=363<U+2013>364}}</ref> Journalists noted that some followers perceived the predicted appearance of [[Comet Kohoutek]] as an omen, as a spaceship on its way to Houston, or as the return of the [[Star of Bethlehem]].<ref name="Levine 1974"/><ref name="Morgan 1973">{{Harvnb|Morgan|1973}}</ref><ref name="Kelley February 1974"/>

A frequently repeated prediction, attributed to Maharaj Ji, was that the Astrodome would levitate.<ref name="Levine 1974"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Boyle| 1985| p=230}}, {{Harvnb|Greenfield |1975| p=11}}</ref> Davis and others made often-reported predictions, repeated in half-jest, that [[extraterrestrials]] would attend the festival.<ref name="Downton1979p6" /><ref name="Kelley February 1974">{{Harvnb|Kelley|1974a}}</ref><ref name="McCarthy">{{Harvnb|McCarthy|1974}}</ref> Bal Bhagwan Ji is said to have predicted the festival would be preceded by earthquakes in New York and Denver, along with a dive in the stock markets.<ref name="Levine 1974"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Collier|1978| pp=154, 162}}</ref> Sociologist Downton wrote that there were runaway expectations about attendance.<ref name="Downton" /> Public predictions of attendance grew larger: from 100,000 to 144,000 (the number foretold in the [[Book of Revelation]] for the [[Second Coming]]),<ref name="Kelley February 1974"/> to 200,000 and even 400,000.<ref>{{Harvnb|Collier| 1978| p=159}}</ref> (The capacity of the Astrodome was 66,000.)<ref name="Blau 1973"/><ref>{{Harvnb|National Park Service|2008}}</ref> Davis told one audience that millions would attend.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pope |1974| p=6}}</ref>

Bob Mishler, the founding president of the DLM in the United States, later said he had tried to slow the growing expectations. He said he had only expected 20,000<U+2013>25,000 and that he toured the country explaining to members that the festival would be significant because of what happened there, not because of the number of attendees. He said he tried to remind them that the aim was to establish peace on Earth, not to travel to another planet.<ref>{{harvnb|Mishler|Donner|1974}}</ref>

==Festival==
===Rainbow Brigade===
During the summer prior to the festival, 380 followers worked full-time in Houston preparing for the event.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greenfield|1975|p=14}}</ref> Known as the "Rainbow Brigade", their motto was "Work Is Worship".<ref name="Levine 1974"/> The total staff for the festival eventually numbered 4,000.<ref name="Webb 1973"/> Fifteen hundred festival volunteers stayed at a former Coca Cola plant, renamed the "Peace Plant" for the occasion, where they slept on folded blankets over the concrete floor.<ref name="Levine 1974"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Greenfield|1975|p=63}}</ref> Another thousand stayed at the Rainbow Inn motel.<ref name="Webb 1973"/> Reporters wrote that the volunteers maintained a tight and professional operation,<ref name="Dreyer 1974"/> and showed the egalitarian obedience of the [[Israeli Army]] or a [[monastery]].<ref name="Morgan 1973"/> One reporter wrote that he never saw a premie lose his temper.<ref name="Morgan 1973"/> Another noted that the workers seemed to be "model human beings, perhaps even on their way to becoming the 'new evolutionary species' that they claim will establish heaven on earth".<ref name="Levine 1974"/>

===World Peace Corps===
The World Peace Corps (WPC), headed by Maharaj Ji's 19-year-old youngest brother, Raja Ji, was the DLM's security force at the event. Raja Ji said its job was "to make sure that whatever is happening, happens correctly".<ref name="And It Is Divine 1973"/>  One of the security group's main tasks was keeping followers away from the guru.<ref name="Levine 1974"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Rudin|Rudin|1980|p=67}}</ref> Journalists reported being pushed around and threatened by the mostly English guards.<ref name ="Goldsmith 1974"/><ref name ="Dreyer 1974"/><ref name="Kelley February 1974"/> The guards were seen by one reporter as exemplifying "the inevitable violence of any millennial sect hell-bent on abstract purity and infinite happiness".<ref name="Gray 1973"/> The World Peace Corps' name was called [[doublespeak]] and compared to the [[Big Lie]].<ref name ="Goldsmith 1974"/><ref name="Scheer 1974"/> An observer was quoted as saying, "These people were mad with a sense of divinity-authorized power. It was like descending into the ninth ring of hell."<ref>{{Harvnb|Kelley|1974b|p=150}}</ref>

===''And It Is Divine'' special issue===

The DLM's magazine ''And It Is Divine'' published a special edition for the event. The 78-page magazine, with Maharaj Ji listed as the [[Editor-in-Chief]], included an invitation to the event, the festival program, and a history of the festival. One article profiled the "Holy Family" (Guru Maharaj Ji, his mother, and three older brothers), illustrated with individual portraits and a group photograph. The festival invitation said, "Three years ago, at the 1970 Hans Jayanti, the present Guru Maharaj Ji proclaimed he would establish world peace. This year at Millennium '73 he will set in motion his plan to bring peace on earth ... for a thousand years." An article compared the nations of the world to the coyote in the ''[[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner|Roadrunner]]'' cartoons who, blinded by the prize he is chasing, runs off the end of the cliff and falls.<ref name="And It Is Divine 1973"/>

An unsigned article, titled "Prophets of the Millennium", referred to prophecies from the [[Book of Isaiah]], [[Hindu]] scripture, [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], [[Edgar Cayce]], [[Jeanne Dixon]], and others. The article noted that prophecies tend to come true, that there are many predictions that the savior will be a child or will come from the East. It concluded by asking whether Guru Maharaj Ji might be that prophesied "Great Savior".<ref name="And It Is Divine 1973"/>

===Hobby Airport arrival===
The arrival of Guru Maharaj Ji and his family on Wednesday, November 7, 1973 was the first big event of the festival.<ref name="Gray 1973"/> A crowd of 3,000 young, clean-cut followers waited for two or three hours at [[Hobby Airport]], a delay that annoyed impatient reporters.<ref name="Levine 1974"/><ref name="Kilday 11/13/73"/><ref name="Webb 1973"/> While they waited, premies covered Maharaj Ji's emerald-green [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls-Royce]] with flowers. A follower told a reporter they wanted him to have the best because he is like a king, as opposed to Christ who was like a beggar.<ref name="Morgan 1973"/> After his late arrival, Maharaj Ji spoke for a few minutes, saying to the assembled,
<blockquote>
It's really fantastic and really beautiful to see you here, the Millennium program will start tomorrow and it'll really be fantastic, it'll be incredible ... and soon people will get together and finally understand who is God. ... There's so much trouble in the world, Watergate is not only in America, it exists everywhere.<ref name="Gray 1973"/><ref name="Kelley February 1974" /> </blockquote>
The premies were smiling and radiant, a state they called "blissed out".<ref name=Rose>{{harvnb|Rose|1973}}</ref> One reporter said that to "look at a blissed-out premie is to peer into an empty house through spotless windows".<ref name="Levine 1974"/> The phrase "blissed out" was used in many reports of the festival, even in their titles, which are cited by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' for the phrase's first uses.<ref>{{harvnb|Simpson|1989}}</ref>

===Stage, signs and effects===
[[Image:Astrodome interior 2 2004.jpg|thumb|alt=The interior of a football stadium. The stadium is empty and covered by a large, dome-like roof; the ends of the playing field have large letters spelling "Houston".|The interior of the Astrodome (picture from 2004, after the removal of the Astrolite sign)]]
Architect and follower Larry Bernstein said he designed the stage not for the audience in the Astrodome, but for the TV cameras.<ref name="Dreyer 1974"/> The {{convert|35|ft|m}}-high  multilevel set fit easily at one end of the field under the dome's {{convert|300|ft|m}} roof. The set, made of glowing white [[Plexiglas]], was described as striking in appearance,<ref name="Kelley February 1974"/> yet, it was reportedly dwarfed by the vast size of the Astrodome.<ref name="Dreyer 1974"/><ref name="Morgan 1973"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Cartwright|1974}}</ref> At the highest level was the guru's throne. Lower levels held the "Holy Family", the mahatmas (sometimes described as the priests or apostles of the DLM),<ref>{{Harvnb|Mangalwadi|1977|p=218}}</ref> and the Blue Aquarius band led by Bhole Ji Rawat, who wore a silver-sequined suit while conducting.<ref name="Blau 1973">{{Harvnb|Blau|1973}}</ref> Red carpeting covered the [[AstroTurf]].

===Program===
Each day's program opened and closed with the singing of [[Aarti]], called an "ancient devotional song of praise to the Perfect Master".<ref name="And It Is Divine 1973"/> According to reports before the festival, its three themes were to be "Who is Guru Maharaj Ji", "Guru Maharaj Ji is Here", and "The Messiah Has Come", though the official schedule in November had a different list.<ref name="Winder & Horowitz 1973"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Wallace|1973}}</ref>

Maharaj Ji watched the proceedings on closed-circuit television in his suite,<ref name="MacKaye 1973"/> and sent his bodyguard down with a can of pink foam confetti to spray the crowd on his behalf, reported as an example of [[lila (divine play)|''lila'', or divine play]].<ref name="Levine 1974"/> In addition to the main program, mahatmas were conducting initiations into Knowledge at local ashrams, and the guru and his family were offering ''[[darshan]]'', or holy presence, to initiates.<ref>{{Harvnb|McDonald|1999|p=86}}</ref>

;'''Day 1 <U+2013> "What is a Perfect Master?"'''
The first day of the festival was Thursday, November 8, 1973. The program listed the topic of the day as "What is a Perfect Master?"<ref name="And It Is Divine 1973"/> It started at noon with an [[oratorio]] composed for the occasion by Erika Anderson.<ref name="And It Is Divine 1973"/> Rennie Davis opened the program by telling the audience that, "All I can say is, honestly, very soon now, every single human being will know the one who was waited for by every religion of all times has actually come"<ref name="Blau 1973"/> The masters of ceremony were Joan Apter, an early US convert and one of Maharaj Ji's secretaries, and Charles Cameron, one of the guru's earliest converts in the UK and editor of ''[[Who Is Guru Maharaj Ji? (book)|Who Is Guru Maharaj Ji?]]''<ref name="Gray 1973"/> Cameron told stories of previous Perfect Masters. After that came a pageant reenacting scenes from the life of Jesus Christ.<ref name="And It Is Divine 1973"/><ref name="Gray 1973"/> In the afternoon Bal Bhagwan Ji delivered a spiritual discourse, or ''[[satsang]]''.

[[Rhythm and blues]] musician [[Eric Mercury]] performed during the dinner interval. [[Stax Records]] had negotiated an agreement with the DLM to make a recording of the event in exchange for showcasing Mercury, one of their new acts. They had already released an album titled "Blue Aquarius" in 1973 that was on sale at the event. Mercury, a Canadian of African ancestry and the only non-member who performed, played before an audience of 5,000 or fewer.<ref name="Gortner 1974">{{Harvnb|Gortner|1974}}</ref> Stax recorded the performance and Mercury said at a press conference that he would give 50 percent of his royalties from the album to the DLM.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greenfield|1975| p=70}}</ref> He later told a reporter that while he was interested in the message initially, he was put off by the pressure to join for what he perceived as an effort to gain ethnic diversity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Van Ness|1973b}}</ref>

Following Mercury was a speech by Bob Mishler and then an hour-long set by the Blue Aquarius orchestra.<ref name="And It Is Divine 1973"/> The highlight of the evening was a ''satsang'' by Maharaj Ji:<ref>{{Harvnb|Greenfield|1975| p=79}}</ref>

But if you think I'm a smuggler then Jesus Christ was a smuggler and so was Lord Krishna and Mohammed.<ref name="Webb 1973"/><ref name="Blau 1973"/></blockquote>

Maharaj Ji said to the crowd, "Try it, you'll like it."<ref name="Moritz 1974"/><ref name="Blau 1973"/><ref name="Gortner 1974"/> (This was the catchphrase from a [[Mary Wells Lawrence|popular 1971 ad]] campaign for [[Alka Seltzer]].)

;'''Day 2 <U+2013> "The Perfect Master is Here"'''
The second day of the festival, Friday, November 9, had the theme of "The Perfect Master is Here". It featured speeches by mahatmas and by Maharaj Ji's mother, Mata Ji. The Divine Light Dance Ensemble performed a dance piece, ''Krishna Lila'', noted for being well-choreographed.<ref name="Dreyer 1974"/> Music included another choral composition by Erika Anderson, another long set by Blue Aquarius, and a performance by the Apostles, a devotional rock band. Maharaj Ji wore a red [[Krishna]] robe and later put on a jeweled crown of Krishna,<ref name="Levine 1974"/><ref name="Webb 1973"/> the "Crown of Crowns for the King of Kings".<ref name="Kilday 11/13/73"/><ref name="Kelley February 1974"/> His ''satsang'' that night included this story:<ref name="Snell 1974"/><ref name="Dreyer 1974"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Levy}}</ref>
<blockquote>Imagine if you wanted a Superman comic real bad. And you go all over asking people if they've got one. You go to all the bookstores and to all the kids in the colleges, and all the people on the streets and no one has one anywhere. And you're real depressed and you're sitting there in the park and this little kid comes up and says "Hey man, how'd you like a Superman comic." And you say, "G'wan. You don't have one." And this kid pulls it from out of his shirt and it is a genuine; a gen-u-ine Superman comic: and you look at it and say, "Hey man; this must be very expensive", and he says, "No, take it, it's yours. It's free." And you don't believe him but then you take it. He just gives it to you. Well if you can imagine that, you can imagine what Knowledge would mean to you.<ref name="Webb 1973"/></blockquote>

;'''Day 3 <U+2013> "World Assemblage to Save Humanity"'''
The third and last day of the festival, Saturday, November 10, was called a "World Assemblage to Save Humanity". A talk by another brother, Raja Ji, and more performances by Blue Aquarius and the Apostles filled the schedule. Plans for the Divine United Organization and the Divine City were announced. Rennie Davis gave a speech that one reporter called the oratorical high point of the festival.  "I tell you now that it is springtime on this earth!"<ref name="Snell 1974"/> [[Jerry Rubin]], a co-defendant in the [[Chicago Seven]] trial, said he had never heard Davis sound more dangerous.<ref name="Webb 1973"/>

The climax of the event was the final ''satsang'' by Maharaj Ji, in which he laid out his plan for peace. According to one reporter his basic message was, "You want peace? Give me a try. Let me have a try. I'll establish peace. It's a simple deal."<ref name="Snell 1974"/> One analogy by Maharaj Ji that several reporters noted compared the techniques of Knowledge to a [[fuel filter]]:<ref name="Gray 1973"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Maharaj Ji|1973b}}</ref>
<blockquote>The thing is that this life is a big car, and inside the car there is a big engine. And in the engine there is a carburetor, which is hooked up to a fuel line. In some cars, before the fuel line hits the carburetor, there is a thing called a filter that makes sure the fuel going into the carburetor is pure. So in this life, the filter for our minds is the Knowledge, and if we are not being filtered properly, many dirty particles enter our minds and eventually the whole engine is destroyed.<ref name="Levine 1974"/></blockquote>

After the ''satsang'' he was presented by grateful premies with a golden sculpture of a swan and a marble plaque depicting a lion and a lamb lying down together.<ref name="Blau 1973"/> The event concluded after a short performance by the Blue Aquarius orchestra. After the program, volunteers hurried to clear the field of the stage and carpeting in time for a football game the next afternoon.<ref name="Gray 1973"/>

[[Top Value Television]] (TVTV) chose the Millennium '73 festival as a topic for a documentary, titled ''[[Lord of the Universe]]''. TVTV was a documentary production company that had just received acclaim for its groundbreaking piece on the 1972 Republican National Convention. They used [[Portapak]] cameras and newly developed recording technology that allowed them to shoot handheld video of broadcast quality. Two teams followed a member and the Soul Rush tour prior to the event. Led by producer [[Michael Shamberg]], five camera teams recorded 80 hours of video at the festival itself. Chicago Seven codefendant [[Abbie Hoffman]], who did not attend, provided commentary. Premie Sophia Collier wrote that the TVTV crew seemed to start filming whenever someone said anything fanatical or ill-conceived.<ref>{{harvnb|Collier|1978| p=174}}</ref> [[PBS]] television stations across the US broadcast the documentary in the spring of 1974 and again in the summer. The documentary went on to win a [[DuPont-Columbia Award]] in 1974 for excellence in broadcast journalism.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyle|1997|p=72}}, {{harvnb|Adler|1974}}, {{harvnb|O'Connor|1974}}</ref>

The national press was more concerned with finances and organization than with "feeling the Knowledge", by one account.<ref name="Kilday 11/13/73"/> Collier complained about the coverage in general and especially about an article by the ''[[Village Voice]]'''s Marilyn Webb that featured her, saying that the article was inaccurate and misrepresented her beliefs.<ref name="Collier 1978 p=178">{{harvnb|Collier|1978| p=178}}</ref> Davis told reporters that he was aware of the perceptions of the event by outsiders, and admitted that the huge stage, flashing lights, and a kid giving parables about cars did not make for a good show.<ref name="Blau 1973"/>

In June 1974, the DLM's ''Divine Times'' newspaper printed an analysis of the press coverage. It criticized articles written about the festival, saying they portrayed Maharaj Ji as materialistic whose followers were misguided. The only article it approved of was in a children's magazine. The review also admitted that the DLM had made a number of mistakes and that the press relations were improper and inept. Carole Greenberg, head of DLM Information Services, said, "We took something subtle and sacred and tried to market it to the public." She said the press had done the movement a favor by holding up a mirror that showed "the garbage we gave them". The article went on to say that the greatest botch was Guru Maharaj Ji's press conference.<ref name="Bass 1974"/>

===Press conference===
Maharaj Ji's press conference, hastily arranged for the morning of Friday, November 9,<ref name="Kelley February 1974"/> was noted for leaving the reporters frustrated and hostile because of what they described as flippant, manipulative, and arrogant answers, and because of an effort to pack the room with supporters.<ref name ="Goldsmith 1974"/><ref name="Bass 1974"/><ref name="Downton 1979 p=189"/> Several dozen followers, mostly foreign, jostled reporters, asked long and complimentary questions, and shouted "Boli Shri" or "Jai Satchitanand" following the answers.<ref name ="Goldsmith 1974"/><ref name="Kelley February 1974"/><ref name="Bass 1974"/> According to the ''Divine Times'' some of the reporters acted like "district attorneys interrogating a hostile witness".<ref name="Bass 1974"/> A reporter from ''[[Newsweek]]'' complained that the evasive responses reminded him of a recent [[Watergate]] press conference with [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Ron Ziegler]], while another observer called it "Nixonian".<ref name ="Goldsmith 1974"/><ref name="Kelley February 1974"/>

:''Q: It's hard for some people to understand how you personally can live so luxuriously in your several homes and your Rolls-Royces''
:A: That life that you call luxurious ain't luxurious at all, because if any other person gets the same life I get, he's gonna blow apart in a million pieces in a split of a second. ... People have made Rolls-Royce a heck of a car, only it's a piece of tin with a V8 engine which probably a [[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevelle Concourse]] has.<ref name="Levine 1974"/><ref name="Moritz 1974"/><ref name="Gray 1973"/><ref name="greenfieldp76"/>
:''Q: Why don't you sell it and give food to people?''
:A: What good would it do. All that's gonna happen is they will need more and I don't have other Rolls-Royces.

:''Q: Guru, what happened to the reporter in Detroit who was badly beaten by your followers?

The conference, which lasted nearly an hour,<ref>{{harvnb|Greenfield|1975| p=77}}</ref> ended shortly after descending into a shambles when reporters pressed for information about the [[Divine Light Mission#Detroit incident|Detroit incident]], in which a reporter who had thrown a pie at Maharaj Ji a few months prior was subsequently beaten by two DLM members.<ref name ="Goldsmith 1974"/><ref name="Gray 1973"/> As of 1976, it was Maharaj Ji's last press conference.<ref name=UPI1976>{{harvnb|United Press International|1976}}</ref>

===Krassner<U+2013>Davis debate===
[[Paul Krassner]] repeatedly challenged Rennie Davis to a debate and Davis finally agreed. It was held in the adjoining Astrohall convention center on the third day, Saturday, November 10, and attended by 30 reporters.<ref>{{harvnb|Greenfield|1975| p=86}}</ref> The question was, "Resolved: That Davis has copped out to turn kids away from social responsibility to personal escape". Ken Kelley was the moderator and KPFT-FM broadcast it live.<ref name="Dreyer 1974"/><ref name=Greenfield87>{{harvnb|Greenfield|1975| p=87}}</ref> Repeating accusations he had been making through the summer, Krassner said that the movement was part of a [[CIA]]-directed conspiracy.<ref name="Levine 1974"/><ref name="Morgan 1973"/><ref name=Rose/><ref>{{harvnb|Kent|2001|pp=178<U+2013>179}}</ref> He called it a neo-Fascist discipline, said Maharaj Ji was a mystic hired to seduce the youth movement into oblivion,<ref name="Kilday73c" /> and called him the spiritual equivalent of [[Mark Spitz]].<ref name=Greenfield87/> He asked, "Did the Maharaj Ji give Richard Nixon a secret contribution?", to which Davis replied, "Yes&nbsp;<U+2013> he gave Richard Nixon his life."<ref name="Gray 1973"/>

Davis said the most important point was that "the Lord is on the planet and he has the secret of life", and that Maharaj Ji would lead "the most serious revolution ever to take place in the history of the world". He said the main battleground now is "the struggle between the mind and the soul" in each person.<ref name="Levine 1974"/> Reporters said that Davis stayed poised while Krassner heckled.<ref name="Dreyer 1974"/><ref name="Scheer 1974"/><ref name="Kilday73c">{{harvnb|Kilday|1973c}}</ref>

Richardson]], the event left the movement "in dire financial straits and bereft of credibility".<ref>James T. Richardson in {{harvnb|Kivisto|Swatos|1998|p=141}}</ref> Religious scholar Robert S. Ellwood wrote that Maharaj Ji's "meteoric career collapsed into scandal and debt" after the event.<ref>{{harvnb| Elwood|1993|p=236}}</ref>

Maharaj Ji gave no public indication that he was disappointed,<ref name="Moritz 1974"/> although one reporter said he appeared to be nonplussed by the turnout.<ref name="Gray 1973"/> He remarked privately on how perfect it was and called the event fantastic.<ref name="Mishler & Donner" /> Three months after the event Davis said that it was significant despite the low attendance, noting that only a small number of people were at the [[Sermon on the Mount]] or the [[Last Supper]].<ref name=Greenfield275>{{harvnb|Greenfield|1975| p=275}}</ref> In a June 1974 interview, Mishler said that the love which filled the Astrodome was the beginning of the human race, and that only those who came to it with expectations were disappointed.<ref name="Mishler & Donner" />

She left the movement soon after.<ref name=McDonald85/> Sophia Collier said that she woke up on the bottling plant floor the next morning wondering why she was there, though she decided to try to repair the movement's public image.<ref name="Collier 1978 p=178"/>

===Debt===
The DLM leadership had expected that a huge attendance would be followed by generous donations.<ref name="Downton1979p6" />  Millennium '73 was free,<ref name="Morgan 1973"/> unlike other DLM festivals that charged sizable fees.<ref>{{harvnb|Richardson|1982}}</ref>  Despite fundraising before the event, lower than expected attendance and mismanagement left the DLM in serious debt, estimated at $682,000.<ref name="Pilarzyk 1978"/><ref>{{harvnb|Frazier|1975}}</ref> Individual members also carried debts incurred for traveling expenses.<ref name="Galanter1989p24"/><ref>{{harvnb|Greenfield|1975|p=274}}</ref>

===Impact===
Thomas Pilarzyk described the festival as the "most important development" in the American movement's history.<ref name="Pilarzyk 1978">{{Harvnb|Pilarzyk|1978}}</ref> [[James V. Downton]] opined that the movement ultimately failed in achieving its millennial dream of world peace.<ref>{{harvnb|Downton|1979| p=188}}</ref> The failure to meet expectations, along with the debt and bad press, led to significant changes in the movement.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rudin|Rudin|1980|p=65}}</ref>

Scholars describe 1973 as the peak year of the movement,<ref>{{Harvnb|Price|1979}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Aagaard|1980}}</ref> or mention a significant drop in new followers.<ref name=Khalsa>{{harvnb|Khalsa|1986|p=235}}</ref> However, Roger E.
