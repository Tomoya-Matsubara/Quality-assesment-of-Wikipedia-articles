=== Cost ===
Israel's Minister of Finance estimated that the operation would cost NIS 8.5 billion (approximately 2.5 billion USD), which is similar to [[Operation Cast Lead]] in 2009 and higher than [[Operation Pillar of Defense]] in 2012. The forecast included military and non-military costs, including military expenditure and property damage. The calculation indicates that if the operation lasts 20 days, the loss in GDP will be 0.4%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-Operation-Protective-Edge-to-cost-NIS-85b-1000953306 |title=Operation Protective Edge to cost NIS 8.5b |accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref>

== Media coverage ==
{{Further|Media coverage of the Arab<U+2013>Israeli conflict}}
Portrayals of the conflict have varied in different media outlets. In the English-speaking world, U.S. news sources were often more sympathetic to Israel,<ref name="Zion" /> though commentators on both sides have stated that U.S. coverage of the conflict has failed to adequately provide context and background for the public to understand the issues involved. Commentators on both sides have also claimed that the media is biased either for or against Israel.<ref>{{cite news |title=US media coverage of Gaza is deeply flawed, both sides in conflict say |newspaper=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |last=Goodale |first=Gloria |date=15 July 2014 |accessdate=15 July 2014 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2014/0715/US-media-coverage-of-Gaza-is-deeply-flawed-both-sides-in-conflict-say}}</ref> British sources were more often critical of Israel.<ref name="Zion">{{cite news |title=Gaza war seen rather differently in US, UK newspapers |newspaper=[[The Times of Israel]] |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-war-seen-rather-differently-in-us-uk-newspapers/ |date=11 July 2014 |accessdate=13 July 2014 |last=Zion |first=Ilan Ben}}</ref> As the conflict progressed and Palestinian deaths increased, media became somewhat more critical of Israel.<ref>{{cite news |title=As Gaza deaths mount, press grows critical of Israel |newspaper=[[The Times of Israel]] |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/as-gaza-death-tolls-climbs-press-increasingly-critical-of-israel/ |date=13 July 2014 |accessdate=13 July 2014 |last=Ahren |first=Raphael}}</ref>

The progressive<ref>[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=100 What's FAIR?], FAIR Website</ref> media criticism organization [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting|FAIR]] said that the mistake reflected a worldview in American media and a "false balance" between the two sides of the conflict, when in fact many more Palestinians have suffered than Israelis.<ref>{{cite web |title=ABC News Apologizes: Diane Sawyer Mixes Up Palestinians, Israelis |website=Newsmax.com |url=http://www.newsmax.com/TheWire/abc-news-apologizes-diane-sawyer/2014/07/11/id/582038 |date=11 July 2014 |last=Sanchez |first=Nick}}</ref> Sawyer later apologized on-air for the error.<ref>http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/diane-sawyer-apologizes-world-news-error-24513856</ref>

Investigative reporter [[Judith Miller]] criticized US media, and her former employer ''The New York Times'' in particular, for being unsympathetic to Israel and downplaying the context of the kidnapping and murder of Israeli teenagers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Judy Miller: The Israelis Believe Obama Has Not Been Sympathetic To Them |website=[[Real Clear Politics]] |date=12 July 2014 |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/07/12/judy_miller_the_israelis_believe_obama_has_not_been_sympathetic_to_them.html}}</ref>

British MP [[George Galloway]] said: "The 300 Palestinians are completely ignored by the same newspapers, by the same television stations and by the same political leaders who are threatening sanctions and war against Russia. ...

Within Israel, the newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' issued an editorial stating that the "soft Gaza sand... could turn into quicksand" for the Israeli military and warning about the "wholesale killing" of Palestinian civilians. The article declared, "There can be no victory here."<ref>{{cite news|date=21 July 2014|title=Israeli Mood Turns Dark With Mounting Casualties|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/israeli-mood-turns-dark-mounting-casualties-24652707|accessdate=22 July 2014|publisher=ABC News}}</ref> The campaign in the Palestinian territories has received much coverage in the nation.

=== Criticism of the BBC's coverage ===
In ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]] called the [[BBC]]'s headline "Israel under renewed Hamas attack", "perverse as [[Mike Tyson]] punching a toddler, followed by a headline claiming that the child spat at him", and that "the macabre truth is that Israeli life is deemed by the Western media to be worth more than a Palestinian life".<ref>{{cite web |title='Israel under renewed Hamas attack', says the BBC.

In London, Newcastle, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow, hundreds protested outside the BBC's offices accusing the corporation of "pro-Israeli bias" in its coverage of the ongoing conflict. It claimed that news coverage was "entirely devoid of context or background". An open letter to BBC director signed by 45,000 people including [[Noam Chomsky]], [[John Pilger]], [[Ken Loach]], [[Brian Eno]] and [[Jeremy Hardy]] said it would "like to remind the BBC that Gaza is under Israeli occupation and siege [and] that Israel is bombing a refugee population".

Building on research by the [[Glasgow University Media Group]] that examined the media coverage of recent Israeli attacks on Lebanon and Gaza, Greg Philo, research director of the university's media unit, described how senior BBC journalists have spoken to him about being unable to get the Palestinian viewpoint across.<ref name="guardianOnBBC" />

=== Social media ===
In the 8 days leading up to Operation Protective Edge, the social media site Twitter [[hashtag]] #GazaUnderAttack was used over 375,000 times. Often the hashtag was used on tweets using photos that claimed to show how the people are suffering due to Israeli attacks. A [[BBC]] study showed that in some cases these photos were from previous Israeli attacks, or from wars in Syria and Iraq.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4539651,00.html |title=As Israel strikes back, fake Gaza images dominate social media |accessdate=8 July 2014 |newspaper=YnetNews}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-28198622|title=#BBCtrending: Are #GazaUnderAttack images accurate? |publisher=[[BBC Online]] |accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref>

A false report circulated on social media and via [[SMS]] that a rocket from Gaza had hit a petrochemical plant in Haifa. These reports cited ''[[Haaretz]]'' as their source but turned out to be false. ''Haaretz'' denies having issued such warnings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2014/07/09/fake-hamas-message-claims-haifa-chem-plant-hit-by-gaza-rocket/ |title=Fake Hamas Message Claims Haifa Chemical Plant Hit by Gaza Rocket |newspaper=Algemeiner |date=9 July 2014 |accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref>

A photograph published by Danish journalist Allan S<U+00F8>rensen on [[Twitter]] caused uproar online, gathering more than 8,500 retweets.
