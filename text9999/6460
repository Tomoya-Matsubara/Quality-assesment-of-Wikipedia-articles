'''Kremvax''' was originally a fictitious [[Usenet]] site at the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]], named like the then large number of Usenet [[VAX]]en with names of the form [[foo]]vax. Kremvax was announced on April 1, 1984 in a posting ostensibly originated there by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Konstantin Chernenko]]. The posting was actually forged by Piet Beertema of [[Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica|CWI]] as an [[April Fool's Day|April Fool]]'s joke.<ref name="beert1">{{cite web|url=http://www.godfatherof.nl/kremvax.html|title=The kremvax hoax|last=Beertema|first=Piet|publisher=godfatherof.nl|accessdate=2009-04-11}}</ref> Other fictitious sites mentioned in the [[hoax]] were moskvax and kgbvax.  The actual origin of the email was mcvax, one of the first European sites on the internet.<ref name="wired1">{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/magazine/16-04/st_best|title=10 Best: April Fools' Gags (the Web Is Closing for Spring Cleaning!)|last=Novak|first=Asami|date=24 March 2008|publisher=Wired|accessdate=2009-04-11}}</ref>

In fact, it was only six years later that the first genuine site in [[Moscow]], [[demos.su]], joined Usenet. Some readers needed convincing that the postings from it weren't just another prank. Vadim Antonov, the senior programmer at Demos and the major poster from there until mid-[[1991]], was quite aware of all this, and referred to it frequently in his own postings.

Eventually, he even arranged to have the domain's gateway site named kremvax.demos.su, thus turning fiction into truth and, according to one account, ''"demonstrating that the hackerish sense of humor transcends cultural barriers"''.<ref>[[Eric S. Raymond|Raymond, E. S.]]: "The [[Jargon File]]", [http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/K/kremvax.html Kremvax entry], 2006</ref> Antonov also contributed some [[Russian language]] material for the [[Jargon File]].
