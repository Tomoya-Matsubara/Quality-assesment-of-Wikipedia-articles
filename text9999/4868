'''Douglas Heye Dieken''' (born February 12, 1949 in [[Streator, Illinois]]) is a radio [[color analyst]] for gameday broadcasts of the [[National Football League]]'s [[Cleveland Browns]].  He formerly was an [[offensive tackle]] who played 14  seasons with the Browns.

==Playing Career==
In college, Doug was a [[tight end]] on an [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]] team that hardly passed at all, and so he was not taken until the sixth round of the [[1971 NFL Draft|1971 draft]].<ref name="Dieken Stats">http://www.databasefootball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=DIEKEDOU01#Bio</ref> His first game in a Browns uniform was an [[exhibition game]] against the [[Chicago Bears]] that happened to be the game used as a backdrop for the movie ''[[Brian's Song]]'' which was released in November 1971. After improving rapidly during his first year with the Browns, the coaches seemed to think he could take over for left tackle [[Dick Schafrath]].  He did, and became only the third left tackle in the team's history. Excellent at both run and pass blocking, Dieken proved to be an outstanding player and an iron man.  He not only went to the [[Pro Bowl]], but he set team records with [[Most consecutive starts (NFL)#Offensive linemen|194 straight starts]] and 203 consecutive games played.<ref name="Dieken Browns Bio">http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/news/article-1/Doug-Dieken-a-career-Brown/27673e2c-eee1-4ae9-b200-4b6a7f82b9d8</ref> Doug also proved to be a fine citizen, winning the NFL Man of the Year Award following the 1982 season, and adding his name and efforts to a number of worthy Cleveland area charities.<ref name="Dieken Browns Bio" />

==Broadcasting Career==
Following his retirement after the 1984 season, Dieken became a [[color commentator]] on Browns radio broadcasts, a job he holds to this day.  He also appears on Browns themed programming on [[WKYC]] channel 3 in Cleveland ([[NBC]]) and [[SportsTime Ohio]] as an analyst. 

Combining his playing and broadcasting career, he has drawn a paycheck from the Browns for over 40 years (having played from 1971 to 1984, serving as a radio/TV broadcaster from 1984 to 1995 and 1999 to present, and served as an ambassador for the Cleveland Browns Trust during the team's "inactive" period from 1996 to 1998).

For his service to the team as an outstanding offensive tackle, Doug was inducted into the prestigious Cleveland Browns Legends in 2006.
