'''William Hickling Prescott''' (May 4, 1796&nbsp;<U+2013> January 29, 1859) was an American historian and [[hispanist]]. He is widely recognized by [[historiography|historiographers]] to have been the first American scientific historian. Despite serious visual impairment, which at times prevented him from reading normally, Prescott became one of the most eminent historians of the 19th century. He is also noted for his [[eidetic memory]].

A direct descendent of the [[American Revolutionary War|revolutionary]] American officer [[William Prescott]], after growing up in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]] Prescott attended [[Harvard University]]. His poor health prevented him from working professionally, and he therefore dedicated himself to a life of writing. After a few years as a freelance writer, he specialised in the study of late [[Renaissance]] Spain and the early [[Spanish Empire]]. His works on the subject, ''The History of the Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella the Catholic'' (1837), ''The History of the Conquest of Mexico'' (1843), ''A History of the Conquest of Peru'' (1847) and the unfinished ''History of the Reign of Phillip II'' (1856<U+2013>8) have become classic works in the field, and have had a great impact on the study of both Spain and [[Mesoamerica]]. He has become the most widely translated American historian, and was the first writer to use [[citations|bibliographical citations]].<ref>Gardiner, p. ix</ref><ref>Gardiner, p. 143</ref>

== Early life ==
William H. Prescott was  born in [[Salem, Massachusetts]] on May 4, 1796, the first of seven children, although four of his siblings died in infancy.<ref>Sullivan, p. 154</ref> His parents were [[William Prescott, Jr.]], who was a lawyer, and his wife, n<U+00E9>e Catherine Greene Hickling. His grandfather [[William Prescott]] served as a Colonel during the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>Peck, p. 13</ref> [[Image:Statue of william prescott in charlestown massachusetts.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A statue of Prescott's grandfather [[William Prescott]] in [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]], [[Massachusetts]]]] Young William Prescott began formal schooling at the age of seven, under a Mr. Jacob Knapp.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 3, Peck p. 16</ref> The family moved to [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]] in 1808, where his father's earnings were substantially increased.<ref>Peck, 2009, p. 18</ref> His studies continued under Dr. John Gardiner, rector of [[Trinity Church, Boston|Trinity Episcopal Church]].<ref>Sullivan, pp. 155<U+2013>156, Peck p. 18, Gardiner p. 7</ref> As a young man, Prescott frequented the [[Boston Athen<U+00E6>um]], which at the time held the 10,000-volume [[private library]] of [[John Quincy Adams]].<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 9</ref><ref>Peck, p. 20</ref> Later, in 1832, Prescott became a trustee of the library, a position he held for 15&nbsp;years.<ref>Gardiner, p. 324</ref>

Prescott enrolled at [[Harvard College]] as a sophomore in August 1811, living in the same room where both his father stayed and his future son would stay.<ref>Sullivan, p. 156, Peck p. 22</ref> He was not particularly distinguished academically, and although he excelled at [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], he found mathematics extremely difficult.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 16, Peck p. 27</ref><ref>Gardiner, p. 20</ref> Although unable to understand mathematical demonstrations, he was able to memorize them word-for-word with ease, which allowed him to hide his ignorance.<ref>Peck, p. 33</ref> Prescott suffered from significant problems with his eyesight as a result of being hit in the eye with a crust of bread as a student.<ref>Peck, p. 31</ref> He relied on his wife, friends and paid assistants to read for him. He resorted to using a [[noctograph]] to write. He was admitted to the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]] as a senior, which he considered a great personal honour.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 26, Peck p. 34</ref> He graduated from Harvard in 1814. After a short period of illness (suspected to have been [[rheumatism]]), he made an extended tour of Europe. However, he first travelled to the island of [[S<U+00E3>o Miguel]] in the [[Azores]], where his grandfather, who was married to a Portuguese woman, lived.<ref>Peck, p. 36</ref> After two weeks, he left for London, where he stayed with the distinguished surgeon [[Astley Cooper]] and the oculist [[William Adams (oculist)|William Adams]].<ref>Peck, p. 37</ref> He visited [[Hampton Court Palace]] (where he saw the [[Raphael Cartoons]]) with the future American president [[John Quincy Adams]], who was at the time a diplomat in London.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 44</ref> Prescott also saw the [[Elgin marbles]] in the [[British Museum]]. In August 1816, he travelled to Paris, and spent the winter in Italy. He returned to Paris in 1817, where he chanced to meet [[George Ticknor]], and made another visit to England, spending some time in [[Cambridge]], where he saw the manuscripts of Isaac Newton's works.  He returned to the United States in 1817.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 49</ref> His first work, an anonymous essay, was rejected by the [[North American Review]] in late 1817.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 51</ref> After a short period of courtship, he married Susan Amory, the daughter of Thomas Coffin Amory and Hannah Rowe Linzee, on May 4, 1820.<ref>Peck, p. 43</ref> Ticknor notes that the couple's ancestors fought on opposite sides of the [[American Revolutionary War]]<U+2014>Captain Linzee having fought for the British at the [[Battle of Gloucester (1775)|Battle of Gloucester]], whereas Colonel [[William Prescott]] fought for the United States at the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]].<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 54</ref>

== Career ==
=== Early career<U+2014>The ''History of Ferdinand and Isabella'' ===
In 1821, Prescott abandoned the idea of a legal career because of his poor health and resolved to devote himself to literature.<ref>Peck, p. 44</ref> Although he initially studied a very wide range of subjects, including Italian, French, English and Spanish literature, [[History of North America|American history]], [[classics]] and [[political philosophy]], Prescott came to focus on [[Italian poetry]].<ref>Gardiner, p. 71</ref> Among the works he studied during this period were such classics as Dante's ''[[La Divina Commedia]]'' and Boccacio's ''[[Decameron]]''. His first published works were two essays in the North American Review<U+2014>both on the subject. The first of these, published in 1824,<ref>Peck, p. 46</ref> was titled ''Italian Narrative Poetry'', and became somewhat controversial after it was heavily criticized in an Italian review by [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], the librettist of [[Mozart]]'s [[Don Giovanni]].<ref>Rossi, Joseph ''The Italian Poems of Thomas James Mathias'', 1943, printed in ''Modern Language Quarterly'', p. 331</ref> Prescott wrote a succinct reply to Da Ponte's fifty-page argument in the ''North American Review'' of July 1825. Da Ponte published the criticisms as an appendix to his translation of Dodley's ''Economy of Human life'', which resulted in it being noticed rather late by Prescott.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 249</ref> Prescott's friend, the Harvard academic [[George Ticknor]], gave him copies of his lectures on Spanish literature, resulting in Prescott's lifelong interest in the history of Spain.<ref>Peck, p. 48</ref> His acquaintance [[Pascual de Gayangos y Arce]] helped him construct a sizable personal library of historical books and manuscripts concerning the subject. [[Alexander Hill Everett]], an American diplomat in Spain, also provided him with material which was unavailable to Prescott in Boston.<ref>Herring, p. 3</ref> Prescott's studies initially remained broad, but he started preparing material on [[Catholic Monarchs|Ferdinand and Isabella]] in January 1826.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 76</ref> However, progress was stalled almost immediately, when Prescott's eyesight suddenly deteriorated. Unable to find a reader fluent in Spanish, Prescott was forced to work through Spanish texts with an assistant who did not understand the language.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 81</ref> When Alexander Everett heard of this situation, he provided Prescott with the services of [[George Lunt]], who had adequate knowledge of Spanish for the task. However, this could only be a temporary arrangement, and he was replaced by a man named Hamilton Parker, who held the position for a year.<ref>Gardiner, p. 87</ref> Eventually George Ticknor, who was by then in charge of the department of modern literature at Harvard University, found James L. English, who worked with Prescott until 1831.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 82</ref> Among the books studied by Prescott in this period, Ticknor lists [[Juan Antonio Llorente]]'s ''Historia cr<U+00ED>tica de la Inquisici<U+00F3>n de Espa<U+00F1>a'', Andr<U+00E9>s Bernadez's ''Historia de los Reyes Cat<U+00F3>licos don Fernando y do<U+00F1>a Isabel'', [[Voltaire]]'s ''Charles XII'' and [[William Roscoe]]'s ''Life of Lorenzo de Medici'', which were to be the sources on which the ''History of Ferdinand and Isabella'' was to be based.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 89</ref> In spring 1828, Prescott visited Washington, where he and Ticknor dined with [[John Quincy Adams]] at the [[White House]], and saw Congress in session.<ref>Gardiner, p. 93</ref>

Prescott had a deep interest in aiding the blind and partially sighted. The [[Perkins School for the Blind]], then known as the New England Asylum,  had been founded in [[Watertown, Massachusetts]] by [[Samuel Gridley Howe]], [[Thomas Handasyd Perkins]] and [[John Dix Fisher]] and 28 others in 1829.<ref>Gardiner, p. 108</ref> Prescott involved himself from the very start of the project, becoming a [[trustee]] in 1830. He published an article in support of education for the blind in the ''North American Review'' of July 1830, and helped to raise $50,000 for the organisation in May 1833.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 253</ref><ref>Gardiner, p. 119</ref>

[[File:History of Ferdinand and Isabella 1838 title pages.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Title pages of 1838 edition]]
His work was disturbed in February 1829 by the unexpected death of his eldest daughter Catherine, who was only four years old. This led him to reconsider his position on religion<U+2014>previously an agnostic, his interest in Christianity was renewed, and having read the Bible, the works of the theologian [[William Paley]] as well as more sceptical works such as [[David Hume|Hume's]] ''On Miracles'', he came to acknowledge the "moral truth" of the gospels, while remaining opposed to the doctrines of orthodox Christianity.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, pp. 91, 152.</ref> Despite this, and continued ill health, Prescott had gathered sufficient material to start drafting the ''History'' in October 1829.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 94</ref> At around this time, Prescott read the works of [[Gabriel Bonnot de Mably]], including his historiographical piece ''De l<U+2019><U+00E9>tude de l<U+2019>histoire''. He henceforth aimed to write history to de Mably's romantic ideal, and on more than one occasion expressed his indebtedness to him.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p.95</ref> He also encountered ''Elogia de la R<U+00E9>ina Do<U+00F1>a Isabel'', by his Spanish contemporary [[Diego Clemenc<U+00ED>n]], which helped shape his views concerning the monarchs' political roles. Due to further problems with his eyesight, it took him sixteen months to write the first three hundred pages of the ''History''. It was largely finished by 1834, but Prescott dedicated two years to [[abridgement|abridging]] and redrafting it. He was also briefly engaged in writing a biography of [[Charles Brockden Brown]] for [[Jared Sparks]]' ''Library of American Biography''.<ref>Gardiner, p. 121</ref> This work was largely based on other contemporary biographies of Brown, and did not become an authoritative work on the subject. He took residence in the rural town of [[Nahant, Massachusetts]] in 1835, due to concerns about his health.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 99</ref> He was here accustomed to riding his horses for the purpose of exercise, and he persevered even in sub-zero temperatures.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 127</ref> Prescott finished the concluding chapter of the work in July 1836. Despite the amount of time and effort which he had spent on the work, he was at first unsure about publishing it. However, his father argued that refusing to publish it would amount to cowardice, and this swayed him.<ref>Griswold, 1847, p. 372</ref> Prescott had previously considered publishing the work in London first, and therefore a printed draft copy of the work was sent to a Colonel Aspinwall for consideration.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 109</ref> However, both [[Longman]] and Murray, which were at the time the leading British publishers, refused the work, and Prescott decided to postpone.

The ''History of Ferdinand and Isabella'' was published on Christmas Day, 1837 by the ''American Stationary Company'', [[Boston]], with a print run of 500&nbsp;copies.<ref>Gardiner, p. 138</ref> It was dedicated to his father. To the surprise of Prescott and the publisher, the book sold very well<U+2014>the original print run was insufficient to supply Boston's bookshops, let alone the whole nation's.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 106</ref><ref>Gardiner, p. 141</ref> It was first published in London by [[Richard Bentley (publisher)|Richard Bentley]] in early 1838. The work received excellent critical reviews, both in America and in Britain, where [[Henry Vassall-Fox]] and [[Robert Southey]] expressed their admiration of the work.<ref name="Gardiner, p. 142">Gardiner, p. 142</ref> It was also noticed in France, despite the fact that a French translation was not available at the time.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 112</ref> Prescott was adamant that his work should not be altered by anyone other than himself, and when he heard that his publishers were considering an abridgement of the ''History of Ferdinand and Isabella'' in June 1839, he produced an abridgement of the work himself, which resulted in the project's cancellation.<ref name="Ticknor, 1864, p. 197">Ticknor, 1864, p. 197</ref>

=== The ''Conquest of Mexico'' ===
Prescott expressed interest in his correspondence in writing a biography of [[Moli<U+00E8>re]], and Ticknor records that he sent Prescott "a collection of about 50 volumes" of relevant material.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p.162</ref> After writing to [[<U+00C1>ngel Calder<U+00F3>n de la Barca y Belgrano|<U+00C1>ngel Calder<U+00F3>n de la Barca]], a Spanish minister living in Mexico, who was able to provide source material, Prescott started research on what was to become the ''History of the Conquest of Mexico''.<ref>Gardiner, p. 148</ref> He extensively read the works of [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], who had written on [[Mesoamerica]], and started corresponding with the historian [[Washington Irving]], the Swiss writer [[Sismondi]] and the French historian [[Jacques Nicolas Augustin Thierry]].<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 176-8</ref><ref>Gardiner, p. 149</ref>  He also received assistance in collecting sources from a college friend, Middleton, and a Dr. Lembke. In contrast to the lengthy time spent researching the ''History of Ferdinand and Isabella'', Prescott started drafting the ''History of the Conquest of Mexico'' in October 1839. However, Prescott faced difficulties in writing the work which he had not encountered previously. There was relatively little scholarship on [[Aztec]] civilisation, and Prescott dismissed much of it as "speculation", which meant he had to rely almost exclusively on primary sources (with the exception of [[Humboldt]]). In particular, he considered [[Edward King, Viscount Kingsborough|Edward King]]'s theory that the pre-Columbian civilizations were non-indigenous to be fallacious, although he was greatly indebted to him for his anthology of [[Aztec codices]] in King's work [[Antiquities of Mexico]].<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 195</ref> Prescott studied Spanish writers contemporary to the conquest, most significantly [[Torquemada]] and [[Toribio de Benavente]].<ref>Gardiner, p. 150</ref> 
[[Image:Harper's monthly magazine. Image of William H. Prescott.png|thumb|right|Depiction of Greenough's bust of Prescott in the June 1850 edition of ''Harper's new monthly magazine''.]] Prescott received three honorary degrees in this period<U+2014>an [[honorary doctorate]] in laws from [[Columbia University]] in autumn 1840, the [[College of William and Mary]] in July 1841 and [[South Carolina College]] in December 1841.<ref>Gardiner, p. 181</ref> He also helped [[Frances Erskine Inglis, 1st Marquise of Calder<U+00F3>n de la Barca|Frances Inglis]] find a publisher for her autobiographical work ''Life in Mexico''.<ref>Gardiner, p. 192</ref>
Prescott found it difficult to evaluate Mesoamerican scientific and mathematical achievements, because of his relative ignorance of those subjects.<ref name="Ticknor, 1864, p. 197"/><ref>Gardiner, p. 162</ref> While working in Boston in 1841, he met [[George Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle|George Howard]], who was to stay a close friend for the remainder of his life. Prescott worked industriously throughout 1840<U+2013>42, and as a result, the work was finished by August 1843. It was published by [[Harper & Brothers]], New York in December, Bentley issuing the British edition.<ref>Gardiner, p. 197</ref> His elderly father had suffered a stroke in October, which resulted in temporary paralysis, so Prescott spent most of the winter attending him in [[Pepperell, Massachusetts|Pepperell]]. The ''History of the Conquest of Mexico'' was received extremely well, both critically and by the general public, despite Prescott's fears to the contrary.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 205</ref> Those praising the work included [[George Hillard]] in the [[North American Review]], [[George Ticknor Curtis]] in the [[Christian Examiner]], [[Joseph Cogswell]] in the ''Methodist Quarterly'', as well as the [[Dean of St. Paul's]], [[Henry Hart Milman]].<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 206</ref>

=== The ''Conquest of Peru'' ===
In 1844, Prescott was painted by [[Joseph Alexander Ames]], and also commissioned a bust from [[Richard Saltonstall Greenough]].<ref>Gardiner, p. 213</ref> He was not active in researching for the ''Conquest of Peru'' until spring 1844, although he had already decided to write a work concerning [[Inca]] civilisation while researching pre-Columbian Mexico, and listened to [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]]'s ''Comentarios Reales de los Incas''.<ref name="Ticknor, 1864, p. 233">Ticknor, 1864, p. 233</ref> He further studied [[Pedro Cieza de Le<U+00F3>n]]'s ''Cr<U+00F3>nicas del Per<U+00FA>'', the works of [[Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa]] and [[Diego Fern<U+00E1>ndez]]'s ''Primera y segunda parte de la Historia del Piru''.<ref name="Ticknor, 1864, p. 233"/> Prescott's progress was stalled by the unexpected death of his brother Edward at sea. His daughter Elizabeth was seriously ill, so Prescott and his family travelled to [[Niagara, New York|Niagara]], which he considered a more healthy environment for her.<ref>Gardiner, p. 218</ref> After her recovery, they returned to Nahant in the summer, where Prescott started drafting the ''Conquest'', and, as was his custom, spent the autumn in Peperell.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 234</ref> Prescott's father died at the age of 82 on December&nbsp;8, which deeply upset him.<ref>Gardiner, p. 223</ref> He took a two-month break from writing to support his widowed mother and settle matters concerning his father's estate.<ref name="Ticknor, 1864, p. 238">Ticknor, 1864, p. 238</ref> His father left numerous stocks, shares and property that amounted to $343,736.86, almost all of which was shared between Prescott and his sister.<ref>Gardiner, 225</ref> Prescott was elected to the [[Institut de France]] in February 1845, in recognition of his accomplishments as a historian.<ref name="Ticknor, 1864, p. 238"/><ref>Bibliographie de la France, Beuchot, 1846, p. 171</ref> He took the place of [[Mart<U+00ED>n Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Navarrete]], who had died the previous year, after a vote was cast. He was also admitted to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Berlin]].<ref name="Ticknor, 1864, p. 238"/> In the summer of 1845, a collection of articles Prescott had published in the ''North American Review'' were published as ''Biographical and Critical Miscellanies'' by Bentley in [[octavo]], and an edition was also prepared simultaneously by Harper & Brothers in New York.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 249</ref><ref>Gardiner, p. 241</ref> Prescott was writing 12&nbsp;pages of the work per day in the summer of 1845, and completed the first two chapters of the ''Conquest''.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 259</ref> He used the inheritance from his father to buy [[Headquarters House (Boston, Massachusetts)|a house]] on [[Beacon Street]] in Boston.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 262</ref> The building is now a [[National Historic Landmark]].<ref name=dames>{{cite web|url=http://www.nscda.org/ma/william_hickling_prescott_house.htm|title=William Hickling Prescott House|publisher=The National Society of The Colonial Dames of America|accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref> Prescott moved into the house during December 1845, and set himself a year to finish the ''Conquest of Peru''. In March, his eyesight, which had recovered significantly, suddenly deteriorated. Prescott was also suffering from acute [[dyspepsia]] and [[rheumatism]], and he travelled to Nahant to "benefit from the sea-air".<ref name="Ticknor, 1864, p. 265">Ticknor, 1864, p. 265</ref> This did not prevent him travelling to Washington, where he dined at the White House with President [[James K. Polk]]. He was also entertained by [[John Y. Mason]], the former [[United States Secretary of the Navy]], who informed him that a copy of Prescott's ''Conquest of Mexico'' had been placed in the library of every fighting ship.<ref>Gardiner, p. 249</ref>  The ''Conquest of Peru'' was completed in March 1847. As with previous works, it was published by Harper & Brothers in the United States and Bentley in Britain. The original US print run was 7,500&nbsp;copies, and the books were sold for $1 each.<ref name="Ticknor, 1864, p. 265"/><ref>Gardiner, p. 262</ref> It was translated into Spanish, French, German and Dutch, and sold excellently. As with his previous works, it was also well-received critically.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 266</ref>

=== Research on Philip II ===
Shortly after the publication of the ''Conquest of Peru'', Prescott turned his mind to writing a history of [[Philip II of Spain]], which he had been contemplating for several years.<ref>Gardiner, p. 279</ref> [[John Lothrop Motley]], who planned to write an independent work on the subject, was aided by Prescott, who gave him access to his library.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 280</ref> Although the two corresponded, there seems to have been little collaboration on their respective works. Prescott had started searching for sources as early as 1842, but a number of difficulties confronted him in his study of Philip II.  The principal archives of historical material were held in [[Simancas]], but neither Lembke (who had collected materials for the ''Conquest of Mexico'') nor Middleton were able to gain access to them.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 285</ref> They had been informed that the library was so disordered as to make productive research impossible, even if access had been gained. However, Lembke, who as a diplomat had been expelled from Spain, made the acquaintance of two wealthy Parisian scholars, [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Mignet|Mignet]] and Ternaux-Compans, who offered him access to their manuscript collections.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 286</ref> Furthermore, de Gayangos assisted greatly by locating important documents in the British Museum and in the collection of the [[bibliomaniac]] [[Thomas Phillipps]], who owned around 60,000&nbsp;manuscripts. He also borrowed several manuscripts from the archives in Brussels, having received letters from the respected Belgian diplomat [[Sylvain Van de Weyer]] in London. de Gayangos became Professor of [[Arabic literature]] at the [[Complutense University of Madrid]] in late 1842, and subsequently lent Prescott rare books and manuscripts from the university library.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 288</ref> By the summer of 1848, Prescott had over 300 works on the subject at his disposal, but he continued to have serious problems with his eyesight; an examination by an oculist confirmed that there was untreatable damage to his retina.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 281</ref> Prescott had been commissioned by the [[Massachusetts Historical Society]] to write a biography of the scholar John Pickering in 1848, which he wrote for publication later in that year.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 283</ref> Prescott was invited to write a history of the [[Mexican<U+2013>American War]], but declined, as he was uninterested in writing on contemporary events.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 291</ref>

Prescott's main secondary source for the history was [[Leopold von Ranke]]'s ''F<U+00FC>rsten und V<U+00F6>lker von S<U+00FC>d-Europa im sechzehnten und siebzehnten Jahrhundert'', a comprehensive work which included a detailed history of the [[papacy]]. Prescott admired Ranke's empirical historical method, and considered his work to be the best of his predecessors on the subject.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 289</ref> He had four copies of the relevant sections of the work reprinted in a large typeface so he could read it without assistance.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 290</ref> He had made a broad plan of the work by February 1849. Prescott started writing the draft on July 26.<ref>Gardiner, p. 283</ref> At this time, Prescott was a creditor of [[John White Webster]], the chemist and murderer, and he was subsequently involved in his trial.<ref>Gardiner, p. 293-4</ref>

=== Visits to Washington and Europe ===
Prescott visited [[Washington D.C.]] in spring 1850, where he met [[Zachary Taylor]], then President of the United States, as well as numerous other prominent figures, including [[Henry Bulwer]], the British ambassador, and [[Daniel Webster]], the former [[Secretary of State]], who had been a friend of Prescott's father.<ref>Gardiner, p. 298</ref> Soon afterwards, he decided to visit England. He embarked from New York on May 22, and arrived at Liverpool on June 3.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 300</ref> There he stayed with an old friend, Alexander Smith, and became reacquainted with Mary Lyell, the wife of the geologist [[Charles Lyell]].<ref name="Gardiner, p. 305">Gardiner, p. 305</ref>  He travelled with the Lyells to London, where they stayed in [[Mivart's Hotel]]. Prescott was greeted in London, as in Washington, by the most important members of society<U+2014>he dined with the [[Foreign Secretary]] and future [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Henry Temple]], the former Prime Minister [[Robert Peel]], as well as the elderly [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]].<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 303</ref> He went to the races at [[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]], and was presented at court to [[Queen Victoria]].<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 309</ref> On June 22, he travelled to Oxford to receive an honorary doctorate in law. In Oxford, he stayed at [[Cuddesdon Palace]], the home of the [[Bishop of Oxford]], [[Samuel Wilberforce]], who was absent because of the christening of the infant [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Prince Arthur]].<ref name="Gardiner, p. 305"/><ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 310</ref> Prescott met [[Spencer Compton]], the president of the [[Royal Society]], who was also receiving an honorary degree.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 312</ref> He left London for Paris, where he arrived on July 20. Two days later, he travelled to Brussels, where he stayed in [[Coudenberg]], the site of a residence of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], returning to London on July 29.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 323</ref> Travelling north, Prescott visited [[Alnwick Castle]] and the ruins of Hulm Abbey in [[Northumbria]]. On his arrival in Edinburgh, he met the geologists [[Adam Sedgwick]] and [[Roderick Murchison]], whom he accompanied to [[Inveraray]], where he visited [[Inveraray Castle]].<ref>Gardiner, p. 311</ref> Prescott then travelled south, through [[Staffordshire]], where he was entertained by [[George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland|George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower]]. He embarked for New York on September 14, arriving on September 27.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 338</ref>

=== Final works ===
Prescott spent the winter in Boston, and returned to the composition of his work. He gradually changed the focus of the ''History'', deciding that he was a better writer of history than biography.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 347</ref> He worked solidly for the next two years, alternating between Boston and Nahant<U+2014>interrupted only by the marriage of his daughter Elizabeth in early 1852.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 400</ref> Her husband was James Alexander; they settled in a house near the family home in Pepperell. Prescott's mother fell ill on May 17 and died soon after, which caused Prescott to fall into a bout of depression that lasted until the winter.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 384</ref> He returned to his work, and continued at the pace that he was able through the remainder of 1852 and 1853, which passed uneventfully. Prescott started to suffer seriously from rheumatism during 1852, which persuaded him to abandon his residence at Nahant.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 390</ref> He bought a house in the then rural town of [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], where he was visited by Charles Lyell and his family in June 1853.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 402</ref> On August 22, he finished the second volume of the ''History''.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 403</ref> The first two volumes were finished by May 1855, but not immediately published.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 404</ref> Changes in [[British copyright law]] and a change of publishers, caused Prescott to delay publication until November. Compared to his previous works, the ''History'' received little coverage in the press or in academic journals. It was suggested to him that he should write a biography of Charles V, but he declined, as he regarded the work of [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]] on the subject to be definitive.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 406</ref> However, he wrote an appendix to Robertson's ''The History of the reign of Charles V'' in May 1855; it was published in December 1856. Previously uninterested in politics (although he had predicted the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] victory in [[United States presidential election, 1840|1840]],<ref>Gardiner, p. 166</ref>) Prescott supported and voted for [[John C. Fr<U+00E9>mont]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1856|1856 Presidential election]].<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 359</ref> He continued to work on the third volume of the ''History'' until he suffered a [[stroke]] on 3 February 1858.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 424</ref> Prescott recovered, but his health was permanently affected, and he decided to temporarily retire from writing. The third volume was therefore published in April, and its scope was more limited than Prescott had originally planned.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 428</ref> He worked on the Spanish translation of the ''Conquest of Mexico'', which had been prepared by [[Jos<U+00E9> Fernando Ram<U+00ED>rez]] and [[Lucas Alam<U+00E1>n]].<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 429</ref>

=== Death ===
In January 1859, Prescott decided to resume his work on Philip II, with the goal of writing a final fourth volume. On January 29, he suffered a second stroke, which resulted in his immediate death.<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 443</ref> He was buried with his parents in St. Paul's Church, and his funeral was attended by representatives, among others, of [[Harvard University]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the [[Essex institute]].<ref>Ticknor, 1864, p. 446</ref>

Prescott's work has remained popular and influential to the present day. Prescott himself was the origin of several now common elements of academic writing, including the use of [[citations|bibliographical citations]] and critical notes.<ref name="Gardiner, p. 142"/> As the work of an amateur historian, the ''History of Ferdinand and Isabella'' was an outstanding achievement, and it arguably was the best English-language work on the subject published until then.<ref>Gardiner, p. 144</ref> The major problems with the work to the modern day historian are not related to the quality of the research or Prescott's understanding of the period, but rather that his focus is on the major political and military events as opposed to social and economic conditions. It has also been argued that Prescott partially subscribed to the [[Great Man theory]].<ref>Commager, p. 324</ref> The ''Conquest of Mexico'' has endured more than any other of Prescott's work: it is regarded as his greatest literary accomplishment.<ref>Gardiner, p. 208</ref><ref>Peck, p. 133-6</ref> However, modern scholarship agrees that there are problems with Prescott's characterisation of the conquest. David Levin has argued that the Conquest shows "inadequate attention to detail" and remains a broad and general account of events.<ref>Levin, David, "History as Romantic Art: Structure, Characterization and Style in ''The Conquest of Mexico''", ''Hispanic American Historical Review'', 39 (February 1959), p. 20-40.</ref> In contrast to the ''Conquest of Mexico'', the ''Conquest of Peru'' has received relatively little modern scholarly attention, perhaps due to some key similarities in style and structure.<ref>Gardiner, p. 265</ref> However, it is generally thought that the work was the authoritative account until the 20th century, and that Prescott used a broader range of source material than any previous writer on the subject.<ref>Gardiner, p. 267</ref> However, the [[archeological]] and [[anthropology|anthropological]] aspects of both works have been heavily criticised by historians since the end of the 19th century. Prescott had never visited archeological sites in Mesoamerica and his understanding of [[Inca]] and [[Aztec]] culture was weak.<ref>Gardiner, p. 268</ref> In defence of Prescott, it has been argued that despite advances in archeological understanding, and a reconceptualization of the nature of pre-Columbian society, the works remain broadly historically accurate, and Prescott's elaborations on fact were due to a fundamental lack of source material.<ref>Gardiner, p. 269</ref><ref>Commager, p. 325</ref> In contrast, ''Phillip the Second'' is considered essentially an inferior piece<U+2014>it lacks the epic structure and literary merits of Prescott's other work, and the work has not received more critical attention than other contemporary accounts of the monarch's life.<ref>Gardiner, p. 332</ref>

There is a popular misconception that Prescott was completely blind, which seems to have stemmed from a misunderstanding of his comment in the preface to ''The Conquest of Mexico'', in which he stated "Nor have I ever corrected, or even read, my own original draft".<ref>Gardiner, p. 211.</ref> The myth was further propagated by a contemporary New York review of the ''Conquest'', and has been a common theme in popular accounts of his work. Other related embellishments of Prescott's disability have also occurred<U+2014>Samuel Moreson, writing in a 1959 article for [[The Atlantic Monthly]], claimed that Prescott had an artificial eye, although there is no evidence to suggest this. It has been argued that Prescott's biographers have naturally been drawn to romanticise his life due to Prescott's own romantic style of history.<ref>Eipper, p. 417</ref>

Four biographies of Prescott have been written.  In 1864, [[George Ticknor]] published a long personal memoir to his friend, which has become invaluable to later historians. Rollo Ogden wrote a biography in 1904, which essentially supplements Ticknor. [[Harry Thurston Peck]]'s 1905 account is considered useful, but academically inferior.<ref>Gardiner, p. xi</ref> C. G. Gardiner's 1969 work is the definitive critical biography of Prescott, taking into account a wide range of unpublished documents that were unavailable to earlier biographers.

The town of [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]] in Arizona was named in his honour, as was [[Headquarters House (Boston, Massachusetts)|Headquarters House]]. A school in Arequipa, Peru, the [[Colegio Anglo Americano Prescott]] also bears his name.
