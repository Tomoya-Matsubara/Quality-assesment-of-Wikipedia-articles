==Name==
The name ''Baidu'' is a quote from the last line of [[Xin Qiji]]'s classical poem "Green Jade Table in The Lantern Festival" saying: "Having searched thousands of times in the crowd, suddenly turning back, She is there in the dimmest candlelight."

The context of the poem is that in ancient China, girls had to stay indoors, and the Lantern Festival was one of the few times they could go outside. In the chaotic sea of lantern lights, they would sneak away to meet their lovers and exchange promises to meet again next year.

A summary of the entire poem: Flowers bursting into bloom in the sky, stars falling like rain (fireworks/meteor shower), Whole streets filled with perfume, jeweled horses pulling ornate carriages, fish and dragon lanterns dancing throughout the entire night. A body decorated with golden thread and butterfly trinket, laughter that has a subtle fragrance. Having searched for this person until exhaustion, when suddenly turning back by chance, I find her standing lonely in the far end of the street in the waning light.

{{cquote|Many people have asked about the meaning of our name. 'Baidu' was inspired by a [[Chinese poetry|poem]] written more than 800 years ago during the [[Song Dynasty]]. The poem compares the search for a retreating beauty amid chaotic glamour with the search for one's dream while confronted by life's many obstacles. '...hundreds and thousands of times, for her I searched in chaos, suddenly, I turned by chance, to where the lights were waning, and there she stood.' Baidu, whose literal meaning is hundreds of times, represents persistent search for the ideal.|30px||[[Robin Li]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ir.baidu.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=188488&p=irol-homeprofile|title=The Baidu Story|publisher=Baidu}}</ref>}}

Baidu News uses an automated process to display links to related headlines, which enables people to see many different viewpoints on the same story. [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] and [[Chinese industry]] sources stated that Baidu received a license from Beijing, which allows the search engine to become a full-fledged news website. Thus Baidu will be able to provide its own reports, besides showing certain results as a search engine. The company is already getting its news department ready. Baidu is the first Chinese search engine to receive such a license.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gadget4boys.com/index.php?page=articles&catid=3&id=20|title=Google's Lookalike is Expanding in China|publisher=Gadget4boys.com|date=January 23, 2007}}</ref>

*''[[Baidu MP3 Search]]'' provides algorithm-generated links to songs and other multimedia files provided by Internet content providers. Baidu started with a popular music search feature called "MP3 Search" and its comprehensive lists of popular Chinese music, ''[[Baidu 500]]'', based on download numbers. Baidu locates file formats such as MP3, [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]] and [[Macromedia Flash|SWF]]. The multimedia search feature is mainly used in searches for [[Chinese pop music]]. While such works are [[copyright]]ed under [[Chinese law]], Baidu claims on its legal disclaimer that linking to these files does not break Chinese law. This has led other local search engines to follow the practice, including Google China(Hong Kong), which uses an intermediate company called Top100 to offer a similar MP3 Search service.
*''[[Baidu Image Search]]'' enables users to search millions of images on the Internet. Baidu Image Search offers features such as search by image size and by image file type. Image listings are organized by various categories, which are updated automatically through [[algorithm]]s.

*''[[Baidu Encyclopedia]]'', is China's largest encyclopedia by users and [[page view]]s/[[web traffic]]; second largest encyclopedia by article count (after [[Hudong]]).
**''[[China Digital Village Encyclopedia]]'' ({{lang|zh|<U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+6570><U+5B57><U+4E61><U+6751><U+5927><U+767E><U+79D1><U+5168><U+4E66>}}), in June 2009, Baidu announced it would compile the largest digital rural encyclopedia in China, according to [[China Securities Journal]]. It is expected to include [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#Village level|500,000 administrative villages in China]], covering 80% of the total 600,000 [[Village (China)|villages in China]]. Baidu is creating the content of this encyclopedia largely from participants of its "rural information competition" ({{lang|zh|<U+4E61><U+6751><U+4FE1><U+606F><U+5316><U+5927><U+8D5B>}}),<ref>[http://xiangcun.baidu.com/ xiangcun.baidu.com]</ref> on which it has spent roughly five million yuan on incentives. Baidu sees China's rural areas as great potential for electronic business ([[e-business]]), evidenced by the fact that revenue grew the fastest from agriculture, forestry, animals, and fishery in the company's keyword promotion project, a crucial source of Baidu's total revenue. In addition to Baidu Encyclopedia, the company will scale up keyword promotion and take advantage of other products, such as Baidu Zhidao and Baidu Youa, to provide consultation, brand ad exhibitions and online network marketing/sales platform support, marketing information for rural tourism and promoting local products.<ref>[http://www.business-internet-china.com/search-engine/china-news/baidu-will-compile-the-rural-digital--encyclopedia.php Baidu will compile the rural digital Encyclopedia]</ref>

As of May 2011, there were 230 thousand partner websites that displayed Baidu Union ads on their websites.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lin|first=Susan|title=Baidu's Content Network - Baidu Union|url=http://www.east-west-connect.com/baidu/baidus-content-network-baidu-union|work=East-West-Connect.com|publisher=East-West-Connect.com}}</ref>

==Competition==
Baidu<ref>[http://www.statista.com/statistics/160829/annual-revenue-of-baidu-since-2007/ Statistics on Baidu's Annual Revenue], Baidu. March 2013.</ref> competes with [[Google Hong Kong]], [[Yahoo! China]], [[Microsoft]]'s [[Bing]] and [[MSN Messenger]], [[Sina.com|Sina]], [[Sohu]]'s [[Sogou]], Wikipedia, [[NetEase]]'s [[Youdao]], [[Tencent]]'s [[Soso.com]] and [[PaiPai]], [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]]<U+2019>s [[Taobao]], [[TOM Online]], [[Xunlei]]'s [[Gougou]](then [[Sogou]]) and [[EachNet]].

Baidu is the No. 1 search engine in China, controlling 63 percent of China's market share as of January 2010, according to iResearch.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/technology/companies/14baidu.html |title=Baidu's Gain from Departure Could Be China<U+2019>s Loss |last=Barboza |first=David |date=January 13, 2010 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> The [[List of countries by number of Internet users|number of Internet users]] in China had reached 513 million by the end of December 2011, according to a report by the [[China Internet Network Information Center]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Lawton|first=Tait|title=Pretty Graphs on Chinese Internet User Demographics, January, 2012|url=http://www.east-west-connect.com/chinese-internet-user-demographics-jan-2012}}</ref>

In an August 2010 ''Wall Street Journal'' article,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703999304575399162122796630.html?KEYWORDS=baidu | work=Wall Street Journal | title=Baidu's CEO Pursues Long-Term Growth | first=Owen | last=Fletcher | date=August 3, 2010}}</ref>  Baidu played down its benefit from [[Google]]'s having moved its China search service to [[Hong Kong]], but Baidu's share of revenue in China's search-advertising market grew six percentage points in the second quarter to 70%, according to Beijing-based research firm Analysys International.

It is also evident that Baidu is attempting to enter the internet social network market. {{As of|2011}}, it is discussing the possibility of working with Facebook, which would lead to a Chinese version of the international social network, managed by Baidu.<ref>[http://www.thinkingchinese.com/index.php?page_id=255 <U+4F20><U+767E><U+5EA6><U+4E0E>Facebook<U+7B7E><U+5408><U+4F5C><U+534F><U+8BAE> <U+2013> Baidu signed a cooperation agreement with Facebook], [http://www.thinkingchinese.com/ ThinkingChinese], April 14, 2011</ref> This plan, if executed, would face off Baidu with competition from the three popular Chinese social networks pengyou.com, [[Renren]]<ref>[renren.com Renren</ref> and [[Kaixin001]]<ref>[kaixin001.com Kaixin001]</ref> as well as induce rivalry with instant-messaging giant, [[Tencent QQ]].<ref>[http://www.thinkingchinese.com/index.php?page_id=270 Baidu and QQ aren't willing to remain outside the Chinese Social Network market], [http://www.thinkingchinese.com/ ThinkingChinese], April 2011</ref>

On February 22, 2012, [[Hudong]] submitted a complaint to the [[State Administration for Industry and Commerce]] asking for a review of the behavior of Baidu, accusing it of being monopolistic.<ref>Yang, Yang (<U+6768><U+9633> ''Y<U+00E1>ng Y<U+00E1>ng'').

On January 9, 2013, Baidu is still number one in the market, with 64.5% of the users, the second one, 360, who launched its own searching engine in August, has already taken hold of 10.2% users. Following is Google and Sogou.<ref>[http://marketingtochina.com/china-seo/ Searching engines in China]</ref>

==Censorship==
According to the ''[[China Digital Times]]'', Baidu has a long history of being the most proactive and restrictive online censor in the search arena. Documents leaked in April 2009 from an employee in Baidu's internal monitoring and censorship department show a long list of blocked websites and censored topics on Baidu search.<ref>[http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2009/04/baidus-internal-monitoring-and-censorship-document-leaked/ Baidu<U+2019>s Internal Monitoring and Censorship Document Leaked (1)], Xiao Qiang, ''China Digital Times'', April 30, 2009<br />[http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2009/04/baidus-internal-monitoring-and-censorship-document-leaked-2/ Baidu<U+2019>s Internal Monitoring and Censorship Document Leaked (2)]<br />[http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2009/04/baidus-internal-monitoring-and-censorship-document-leaked-3/ Baidu<U+2019>s Internal Monitoring and Censorship Document Leaked (3)]</ref> In May 2011, pro-democracy activists sued Baidu for violating the U.S. constitution by the censorship it conducts in accord with the demand of the Chinese government.<ref>Jonathan Stempel, "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/19/china-baidu-sued-internet-censorship_n_864006.html China, Baidu Sued In U.S. For Internet Censorship]", ''Reuters'', May 19, 2011.</ref>

==Domain name hacked==
On January 12, 2010, Baidu.com's DNS records in the United States were altered such that browsers to baidu.com were redirected to a website purporting to be the [[Iranian Cyber Army]], thought to be behind the attack on [[Twitter]] during the [[2009 Iranian election protests]], making the actual site unusable for four hours.<ref>{{cite news |title=Baidu hacked by 'Iranian cyber army' |publisher=BBC News  |date=2010-01-12 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8453718.stm |accessdate=2010-01-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100113052111/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8453718.stm| archivedate= January 13, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Internet users were met with a page saying "This site has been attacked by [[Iranian Cyber Army]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90778/90860/6866089.html|title=China's top search engine Baidu hacked|date=January 12, 2010|work=People's Daily}}</ref> Chinese hackers later responded by attacking Iranian websites and leaving messages.<ref name=guard>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jan/12/iranian-hackers-chinese-search-engine|title='Iranian' hackers paralyse Chinese search engine Baidu|last=Branigan|first=Tania|date=January 12, 2010|work=The Guardian |location=London }}</ref>
Baidu later launched legal action against [[Register.com]] for gross negligence after it was revealed that Register.com's technical support staff changed the email address for Baidu.com on the request of an unnamed individual, despite their failing security verification procedures. Once the address had been changed, the individual was able to use the forgotten password feature to have Baidu's domain passwords sent directly to them, allowing them to pull off the [[domain hijacking]].<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703837004575013742840069602.html?mod=googlenews_wsj Baidu Sues Register.com, Alleges Negligence in Hacking Attack]</ref><ref>[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9162118/Baidu_Registrar_incredibly_changed_our_e_mail_for_hacker "Baidu: Registrar 'incredibly' changed our e-mail for hacker," ''Computer World'', February 24, 2010.] Accessed December 13, 2010.</ref>

==Baidu advertising==
Baidu's primary advertising product is called Baidu Tuiguang and is similar to [[Google Adwords]] and [[Adsense]]. It is a [[pay per click]] advertising platform that allows advertisers to have their ads shown in Baidu search results pages and on other websites that are part of Baidu Union.

Baidu sells its advertising products via a network of resellers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lawton|first=Tait|title=Baidu Pay Per Click: 7 Tips for a Successful Campaign|url=http://www.searchenginejournal.com/baidu-pay-per-click-7-tips-for-a-successful-campaign/51002/|publisher=SearchEngineJournal.com}}</ref>

Baidu's web administrative tools are all in Chinese, which makes it tough for non-Chinese speakers to use. Recently, a third-party company began to develop a tool with an English-language interface for Baidu advertising programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/06/glogou/ |title=Glogou Launches New Tools To Help Businesses Build Their Online Presence (And Ad Campaigns) In China |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2012-11-06 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=<U+4F5C><U+8005><U+FF1A><U+6E05><U+8FB0> |url=http://tech.sina.com.cn/i/csj/2012-11-07/14387777422.shtml |title=<U+4E0D><U+61C2><U+4E2D><U+6587><U+6CA1><U+5173><U+7CFB> Glogou<U+5E2E><U+52A9><U+5916><U+4F01><U+8FDB><U+519B><U+4E2D><U+56FD>_<U+4E92><U+8054><U+7F51>_<U+79D1><U+6280><U+65F6><U+4EE3>_<U+65B0><U+6D6A><U+7F51> |publisher=Tech.sina.com.cn |date=2012-11-07 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>

Moreover, the service may only be used by advertisers with a registered business address in China or in several other East Asian countries.<ref>"How to manage a PPC campaign on Baidu", presentation on Slide Share http://fr.slideshare.net/Open_Link/manage-baidu-ppc-registration?from=ss_embed</ref>

==DNA copyright technology==
In April 2012 Baidu applied for a patent for its DNA copyright recognition technology. This technology will automatically scan files that are uploaded by internet users, and recognize and filter out content that may violate copyright law. This will allow Baidu to offer an infringement-free platform.<ref>[http://www.brightwire.com/company/9092-baidu-inc ]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Baidu Applies for DNA Copyright Recognition Technology Patent |url=http://www.brightwire.com/news/203281-baidu-applies-for-dna-copyright-recognition-technology-patent |publisher=BrightWire}}</ref>

==Site-wise search patented technology==
Baidu has applied for a utility patent in the UK, for its proprietary site-wise search technology which is currently available in China.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

== Baidu workers arrested ==
On August 6, 2012, the [[BBC]] reported that three employees of Baidu were arrested on suspicion that they accepted bribes. The bribes were allegedly paid for deleting posts from the forum service. Four people were fired in connection with these arrests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19149185 |title=BBC News - Baidu workers arrested for 'deleting posts for money' |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-08-06 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>

== R&D and Innovation ==
In the last years, Baidu started to increase its R&D expenditure steadily. In 2009, the they accounted for USD 68 mn and only three years later, in 2012, Baidu spent more than USD 370 mn for R&D. In the year 2010, the company filed more than 120 patent and utility model applications.<ref>http://www.chinese-champions.com/baidu/</ref>

Baidu has started to invest in deep-learning research and is integrating new deep-learning technology into some of its apps and products, including Phoenix Nest. Phoenix Nest is Baidu's ad-bidding platform.<ref>{{cite web |work=BrightWire News |url=http://bw-original-reporting.tumblr.com/post/55521356692/baidu-using-deep-learning-technology-to-boost-phoenix |title=Baidu Using Deep-Learning Technology to Boost Phoenix Nest Revenue | last=Hsu | first=Alex | date=15 July 2013}}</ref>

==Sogou acquisition rumors==

[[Sohu]]'s search engine [[Sogou.com]] is believed to be for sale, and, according to sources, Baidu is a likely acquirer.<ref>{{cite web |work=BrightWire News |url=http://bw-original-reporting.tumblr.com/post/54340198852/baidu-in-the-lead-to-acquire-sogou-any-merger |title=Baidu In The Lead to Acquire Sogou; Any Merger Involving Sogou Will Face Scrutiny From China<U+2019>s Ministry of Commerce | last=Hsu | first=Alex | date=1 Jul 2013}}</ref>

==91 Wireless==

On July 16, 2013, Baidu announced its intention to purchase [[91 Wireless]] from [[NetDragon]]. 91 Wireless is best known for its app store, but it has been reported that the app store faces piracy and other legal issues.<ref>{{cite web |work=BrightWire News |url=http://bw-original-reporting.tumblr.com/post/55606959057/91-wireless-app-store-has-piracy-and-other-legal |title=91 Wireless<U+2019> App Store Has Piracy and Other Legal Issues | last=Hsu | first=Alex | date=16 Jul 2013}}</ref> In August 2013, Baidu announced it had agreed to buy 91 Wireless from [[Netdragon]] for $1.85 billion in what was hailed as the biggest deal ever in China<U+2019>s IT sector.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/14/us-baidu-91wireless-idUSBRE97D0AR20130814| title=Baidu says agrees to buy Netdragon's 91 Wireless for $1.85 billion | author=Paul Carsten | publisher=Reuters | date=14 August 2013}}</ref>
