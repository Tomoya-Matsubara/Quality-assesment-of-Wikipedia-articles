The '''1991 Perfect Storm''', also known as the '''Halloween Nor'easter of 1991''', was a [[nor'easter]] that absorbed [[Hurricane Grace (1991)|Hurricane Grace]] and ultimately evolved into a small hurricane late in its life cycle. The initial [[low pressure area|area of low pressure]] developed off [[Atlantic Canada]] on October&nbsp;28. Forced southward by a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to its north, it reached its peak intensity as a large and powerful cyclone. The storm lashed the [[East Coast of the United States]] with high waves and coastal flooding, before turning to the southwest and weakening. Moving over warmer waters, the system transitioned into a [[subtropical cyclone]] before becoming a tropical storm. It executed a loop off the [[Mid-Atlantic states]] and turned toward the northeast. On November&nbsp;1 the system evolved into a full-fledged hurricane with peak winds of 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h), although the [[National Hurricane Center]] left it unnamed to avoid confusion amid media interest in the predecessor extratropical storm. It later received the name "the Perfect Storm" after a conversation between Boston [[National Weather Service]] forecaster [[Robert Case]] and author [[Sebastian Junger]]. The system was the fourth hurricane and final tropical cyclone in the [[1991 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The tropical system weakened, striking Nova Scotia as a tropical storm before dissipating.

Damage from the Perfect Storm totaled over $200&nbsp;million (1991&nbsp;USD)<ref name="ncdc">{{cite web|last=McCown|first=Sam|work=National Climatic Data Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2008-08-20|title="Perfect Storm" Damage Summary

Most of the damage occurred while the storm was extratropical, after waves up to {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} struck the coastline from Canada to Florida and southeastward to Puerto Rico. In Massachusetts, where damage was heaviest, over 100&nbsp;homes were destroyed or severely damaged. To the north, more than 100&nbsp;homes were affected in Maine, including the vacation home of then-[[President of the United States|President]] [[George H.W. Bush]]. More than 38,000&nbsp;people were left without power, and along the coast high waves inundated roads and buildings. In portions of New England, damage was worse than [[Hurricane Bob]] had caused two months prior.

Aside from tidal flooding along rivers, the storm's effects were primarily concentrated along the coast. A buoy off the coast of Nova Scotia reported a wave height of 100.7&nbsp;ft (30.7&nbsp;m), the highest ever recorded in the province's offshore waters. In the middle of the storm, the [[Andrea Gail]] sank, killing its crew of six and inspiring the [[The Perfect Storm (book)|book]], and later [[The Perfect Storm (film)|movie]], ''The Perfect Storm''. Off the shore of New York's [[Long Island]], an Air National Guard helicopter lost fuel and crashed; four members of its crew were rescued, and one was killed. Two people died after their boat sank off [[Staten Island]]. High waves swept people to their deaths in Rhode Island and Puerto Rico, and another person was blown off a bridge to his death. The tropical cyclone that formed late in the storm's duration caused little impact, limited to power outages and slick roads; one person was killed in Newfoundland from a traffic accident related to the storm.

==Meteorological history==
[[File:1991 Atlantic hurricane 8 track.png|left|thumb|Storm track beginning southeast of Canada as an extratropical storm, moving westward toward New England, becoming tropical as it looped to the northeast, and later dissipating over Nova Scotia]]
The Perfect Storm originated from a [[cold front]] that exited the east coast of the United States. On October&nbsp;28, the front spawned an extratropical low to the east of Nova Scotia. Around that time, a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] extended from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] northeastward to Greenland, with a strong high pressure center over eastern Canada. The blocking ridge forced the extratropical low to track toward the southeast and later to the west. Hurricane Grace was swept aloft by its cold front into the warm conveyor belt circulation of the deep cyclone on October&nbsp;29. The cyclone significantly strengthened as a result of the temperature contrast between the cold air to the northwest and the warmth and humidity from the remnants of Hurricane Grace. The low pressure system continued deepening as it drifted toward the United States.<ref name="history2"/> It had an unusual retrograde motion for a [[nor'easter]], beginning a set of meteorological circumstances that occur only once every 50 to 100&nbsp;years.<ref name="case">{{cite web|publisher=National Oceanographic & Atmospheric Administration News|date=2000-06-16|title=NOAA Meteorologist Bob Case, the Man Who Named the Perfect Storm|accessdate=2011-07-01|url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/s444.htm}}</ref> Most nor'easters affect New England from the southwest.<ref name="pp">{{cite news|author=Staff writer|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=1991-10-31|title=East battered by storm born off Canada; 4 lost|accessdate=2011-07-03|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Md8cAAAAIBAJ&sjid=GGQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6189,8218796&dq=storm+new+england&hl=en}}</ref>

Beginning in 1950, the [[National Hurricane Center]] named officially recognized tropical storms and hurricanes. The unnamed hurricane was reported to have met all the criteria for a tropical cyclone, but it was purposefully left unnamed. This was done to avoid confusion among the media and the public, who were focusing on the damage from the initial nor'easter, as the hurricane itself was not expected to pose a major threat to land.

Across the area, tide heights reached their highest since the 1944 hurricane, leaving severe coastal and back bay flooding and closing many roads. The storm also caused significant beach erosion,<ref name="ncdc"/> with 500,000&nbsp;[[cubic yard]]s (382,000&nbsp;cubic meters) lost in [[Avalon, New Jersey|Avalon]], as well as $10&nbsp;million damage to the beach in [[Cape May, New Jersey|Cape May]].

===Further south===
In North Carolina along the [[Outer Banks]], high waves were initially caused by Hurricane Grace and later its interaction with a high pressure system. This produced gale-force winds and {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} waves in the town of [[Duck, North Carolina|Duck]]. Later, the extratropical predecessor to the unnamed hurricane produced additional high waves, causing oceanfront flooding from [[Cape Hatteras]] through the northern portions of [[Currituck County, North Carolina|Currituck County]]. Flooding was first reported on October&nbsp;28, when the ocean covered a portion of [[North Carolina Highway 12]] north of [[Rodanthe, North Carolina|Rodanthe]];<ref name="nc"/> the route is the primary thoroughfare in the Outer Banks.<ref name="star"/> [[Nags Head, North Carolina|Nags Head]], [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina|Kitty Hawk]], and [[Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina|Kill Devil Hills]] had large portions covered with water for several blocks away from the beach.
