More than a dozen candidates ran in the Portland race, but news outlets called Dozono the only candidate to provide a serious challenge to front-runner Sam Adams.<ref>{{cite news | title=Editorial | publisher=[[Willamette Week]] | url=http://wweek.com/editorial/3421/10748/ | date=2008-04-02 | accessdate=2008-04-06}}</ref> <ref name="Griffin 13th"/> An automated telephone [[poll]] of approximately 600 Portland residents in early April suggested that Dozono was within a [[percentage]] point of Adams in supporters.<ref>{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Dunn |title=Exclusive KATU poll shows close mayoral race |url=http://www.katu.com/news/local/17507714.html |work=KATU |date=Thursday April 10, 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-15 }}</ref> <ref>{{cite news |first=Anna |last=Griffin |title=Poll shows Adams and Dozono close in Portland mayor's race |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2008/04/poll_shows_adams_and_dozono_cl.html |work=oregonlive.com |publisher=The Oregonian |date=Thursday April 10, 2008, |accessdate=2008-04-15 }}</ref> In the official results of the vote, Dozono garnered the second most votes of any candidate, around 34%, while Adams won with over 50%. Winning over 50% ensures that no [[Runoff voting|run off vote]] is required in November to confirm the result. According to Dozono's campaign manager, it is not expected that he will run for office again.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2008/05/19/daily21.html |work=The Portland Business Journal |date=Wednesday, May 21, 2008 |title=Adams wins mayoral race |accessdate=2008-05-21}}</ref>

===Campaign financing===
Following a lawsuit, a judge reversed the Portland [[Audit|City Auditor]]'s decision to award Dozono [[Clean Elections|public financing]], and found Dozono in violation of the city's campaign finance law. At issue was a [[poll]] testing Dozono's electability, which a [[lobbyist]] had conducted on Dozono's behalf in [[December 2007]], the month before he officially announced his candidacy.<ref name="still on"/> Dozono was subsequently denied $161,171 in public funds as a result of the judge's ruling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portlandonline.com/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=189542 |work=Final Order in the Matter of the Public Financing of Sho Dozono |accessdate=2008-04-16 |publisher=Office of Administrative Hearings, State of Oregon |title=portlandonline.com }}</ref> Dozono continued in the race despite the lack of public financing, and stated that he would cap individual contributions to his campaign at $500, similar to a limit set by Adams.<ref name="still on">{{cite news |first=Cory |last=Pein |title=Dozono's In: Mayoral Race Still On |url=http://wweek.com/wwire/?p=11307 |work=[[Willamette Week]] |date=March 24th 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-29 }}</ref>

===Financial history===
Although fiscal responsibility was a central theme of Dozono's campaign, a March 2008 story by ''The Oregonian'' noted issues that had been raised about Dozono's business dealings during his 20-year career.<ref name="Grif28"/> The report stated that Dozono had occasionally mixed friendship with business, by accepting loans from personal connections for his travel agency, and raised ethical questions about Dozono's involvement in several business dealings, one of which resulted in a lawsuit and an $800,000 [[legal settlement|settlement]].<ref name="Grif28"/> These questions had previously been raised in an investigative report by [[Nigel Jaquiss]] in the ''Willamette Week'' six years earlier, which also alleged that Dozono had borrowed $1.25 million against the [[trust fund]] of a child to companies he controlled, an amount that was subsequently repaid with interest.<ref name=jaquiss/> 

In April, it became public that Dozono owed the City of Portland more than $18,000 in back rent on a downtown restaurant which he owns.<ref name="Dworkin May 1">{{cite news |first=Andy |last=Dworkin |title=Portland mayoral candidate says restaurant ready to pay city tab |work=oregonlive.com |publisher=The Oregonian |date=Thursday, May 01 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-01 |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/news/1209614116304370.xml&coll=7 }}</ref> Several sources cited the incident as a contradiction to his claim to fiscal responsibility.<ref name="Neves May 1">{{cite news |first=Randy |last=Neves |title=Mayoral candidate Dozono says owed back rent a 'business move' |work=kgw.com |publisher=[[KGW]] |date=Tuesday, April 29, 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-01 |url=http://www.kgw.com/news-local/stories/kgw_042808_news_dozono_rent_business.acba8676.html }}</ref> In a [[press conference]] on the first of May, Dozono displayed [[Cheque|check]]s intended to pay the amount owed<ref name="Dworkin May 1"/> and stated that the withheld rent was an intentional act meant to be used as leverage in negotiations with the city over nearby construction and lack of parking.<ref name="Neves May 1"/> The amount was later paid in full.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/news/1210037120137880.xml&coll=7 |first=Andy |last=Dworkin |title=Dozono's restaurant fully pays debts to city |date=May 06, 2008 |work=oregonlive.com |publisher=The Oregonian }}</ref>
