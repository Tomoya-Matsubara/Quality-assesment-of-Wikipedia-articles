"'''You Have 0 Friends'''" is the fourth episode of the [[South Park (season 14)|fourteenth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', and the 199th episode of the series overall. It first aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the [[United States]] on April 7, 2010. In the episode, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] make [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] a [[Facebook]] profile against his will and he becomes extremely frustrated with everyone asking him for friend requests. After he gets fed up with Facebook, Stan tries to delete his profile but is sucked into a virtual Facebook world. Meanwhile, Kyle starts trying to find ways to get more friends on Facebook after he drastically starts losing them due to his befriending of a third-grade friendless Facebook user, whom everyone considers a loser.

The episode was written and directed by co-creator [[Trey Parker]] and was rated [[TV-MA]] L in the United States.<ref name="episodeguide">{{cite web |author= |title=South Park episode guide |url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/guide/1404/ |work= |publisher=South Park Studios |date=2010-04-04 |accessdate=2010-04-04}}</ref> "You Have 0 Friends" features several references to the popular social networking service [[Facebook]], and [[Stan Marsh|Stan's]] plotline parodies the 1982 [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[Tron]]'' with Stan in the role of Kevin Flynn. The episode also parodies the [[CNBC]] series ''[[Mad Money]]'', as well as the online chat website [[Chatroulette]], and the social network game ''[[FarmVille]]''.

"You Have 0 Friends" has received positive reviews from critics, and according to [[Nielsen Media Research]], the episode was viewed by 3.071 million viewers and became the cable lead in the 18<U+2013>49 Wednesday night.

== Plot ==
[[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] surprise [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] by creating a [[Facebook]] account for him. Stan protests, but is quickly pressured by family and friends to add them as [[Social network service#Basics|friends]]. To his annoyance and frustration, Stan finds people such as [[List of South Park families#Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy]], [[List of South Park families#Grandpa Marvin Marsh|his grandmother]] and even [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] confronting him over his supposed disregard for them and judging his real-world friendship solely by his Facebook configuration. Meanwhile, Kyle adds shy nerdy student Kip Drordy to his thriving friends list out of pity. Kyle's number of Facebook friends rapidly declines when he does this, in part due to a ''Mad Friends'' [[podcast]] he finds Cartman has set up in which he berates Kyle for choosing a loser as a friend and [[self-fulfilling prophecy|asserts]] nobody will want to hang out with Kyle. Kyle understands this, but, on principle and out of pity, cannot bring himself to delete Kip to please others. Desperate to stem the loss of friends, he asks Cartman for advice. Cartman introduces Kyle to ''[[Chatroulette]]'' as a way to make new friends. Cartman finally finds another Jewish kid named Isiah, who agrees to be Kyle's friend, much to Kyle's delight.

Meanwhile, Stan now has 845,323 friends (almost all of whom he hardly knows or does not know) on his account and has finally decided to delete it, only to find that [[Criticism of Facebook#Inability to voluntarily terminate accounts|Facebook refuses to allow him to]]. Instead of deleting his account, Stan is forcibly transported by the software into the [[virtual world]] of Facebook, where he meets "profiles" of everyone he knows who communicate in Facebook lingo, and is forced to engage in Facebook activities such as [[Yahtzee]]. Unexpectedly winning on the first roll, Stan escapes and finds his way to Kyle's ''[[Farm Town]]'' farm, blaming Kyle for getting him "sucked into Facebook" in the first place. Stan orders Kyle to check out his profile status and Kyle finds out that Stan is supposedly hosting a party elsewhere in Facebook at ''[[Caf<U+00E9> World]]''. Kyle makes it to Stan's party, only to find that Isiah has refused to be his friend because of Kip. Desperate to retain some friends, Kyle finally deletes Kip, leaving him with no friends. Kip, too, is disheartened to find his friend has abandoned him.

At the party, Stan encounters his online profile, which has the form of a huge monstrous version of himself. It challenges him to a game of Yahtzee and Stan wins, again on the first roll, causing the profile to be finally deleted. The victory returns Stan to the real world once more. He now has no Facebook friends, and Randy, upon realizing that Stan is no longer his friend, asks Stan why he deleted him. Stan explains what just happened to him and that he has "sent all his friends somewhere else". Back at Kip's house, Kip is still depressed about Kyle deleting him as a friend, but is then overjoyed when all 845,323 friends Stan had prior to deletion are suddenly transferred to his account as friends.

"You Have 0 Friends" was written and directed by co-series creator Trey Parker.

He came up with the idea of doing something similar to ''Tron''.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3g6VNrk_Og  South Park Season 14 You Have 0 Friends Commentary] on [[Youtube]].

There have been less favorable reviews of "You Have 0 Friends" that criticize the use of its cultural Facebook jokes. TV Fanatic, who gave the episode 3/5, said there was "too much Facebook" in the episode and that "it was a great parody, but just a decent episode that could have had more [[LOL]] moments".<ref name="tvfanatic">{{cite web |author= |title=South Park Review: 'You Have 0 Friends' |url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2010/04/south-park-review-you-have-0-friends/ |work= |publisher=TV Fanatic |date=2010-04-08 |accessdate=2010-04-08}}</ref> Grading it a D+, [[The A.V.
