'''State Route 242''' ('''SR 242, OH 242''') is an east<U+2013>west [[state highway]] in the west-central portion of [[Ohio]].  The western terminus of the state highway is at [[U.S. Route 127 (Ohio)|U.S. Route 127]] approximately {{convert|5|mi|km}} north of [[Greenville, Ohio|Greenville]].  Its eastern terminus is at a T-intersection with [[Ohio State Route 121|State Route 121]] adjacent to [[Darke County Airport]] about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} southwest of [[Versailles, Ohio|Versailles]].

Created in the middle of the 1920s, State Route 242 runs through very flat farm country in the northeastern portion of [[Darke County, Ohio|Darke County]].  The highway abuts the western and northern edges of Darke County Airport along the way.

==Route description==
State Route 242 is nestled entirely within the northeastern quadrant of [[Darke County, Ohio|Darke County]].

State Route 242 begins at the rural [[Richland Township, Darke County, Ohio|Richland Township]] intersection of [[U.S. Route 127 (Ohio)|U.S. Route 127]] and Reed Road.  The vast majority of the state highway passes through farmland, with the occasional home appearing along the way.  Heading due east from the U.S. Route 127 intersection, State Route 242 immediately intersects Greenville-St. Marys Road, then proceeds among the vastness of crops, meeting Schroder Road and Younker Road en route arriving at the Horner Road intersection.  Here, State Route 242 turns north onto the alignment of Horner Road, with the road continuing east from the intersection being Chase Road.  As it heads northward, State Route 242 now passes by the western edge of [[Darke County Airport]].  The state route next arrives at its intersection with Plessinger Road.  At this point, State Route 242 turns east again, with the road heading north from this intersection becoming known as Shaffer Road.  Running due east along the north side of the county airport, State Route 242 passes into [[Wayne Township, Darke County, Ohio|Wayne Township]] prior to arriving at its endpoint at its junction with [[Ohio State Route 121|State Route 121]], where the intersecting state highway forms the southern and eastern legs of the T-interesction.<ref name="YahooMap">{{yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=40.210979&lon=-84.547082&zoom=13&q1=40.20167%2C-84.581887&q2=40.209799%2C-84.522578|title=Overview Map of State Route 242 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}</ref>
