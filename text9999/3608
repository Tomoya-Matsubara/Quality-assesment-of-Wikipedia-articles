==Route details==
The ''Piedmont'' and ''Carolinian'' operate over Amtrak, [[CSX Transportation]], and [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] trackage:
*Amtrak [[Northeast Corridor]], New York to [[Washington, DC|Washington]]
*CSX [[Landover Subdivision]], [[RF&P Subdivision]], [[Richmond Terminal Subdivision]], [[North End Subdivision]], and [[South End Subdivision]], Washington to [[Selma, NC|Selma]]
*NS<!--what district(s)?-->, Selma to Charlotte

The Carolinian and Piedmont are financed by and operated in partnership with the State of North Carolina (through the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT)).

==Rolling stock==
The motive power for the ''Piedmont'' is provided by 3 state-owned locomotives, of which two are [[EMD F59PHI]]s numbered 1755 (City of Salisbury) and 1797 (City of Asheville), and one (City of Raleigh) is a rebuilt [[GP40PH-2]] numbered 1792<ref name=rolling_stock>[http://www.bytrain.org/passenger/pdf/dotrailequipment.pdf  List of Piedmont equipment owned by NCDOT (PDF format)]</ref> and originally used in the 1960s by the [[L&N]]. Locomotives from Amtrak's national system, such as [[GE P42]]s, can be spotted working on the ''Carolinian''.

State owned passenger cars on the Piedmont are refurbished coach cars originally built by [[Pullman-Standard]] and the [[St. Louis Car Company]] in the 1960s for the [[Kansas City Southern]] and [[Union Pacific]]. There are two lounge cars and one combination car originally built by the St. Louis Car Company in the 1950s and used by the [[United States Army]]. 

All rolling stock is painted in special North Carolina livery (different from the national Amtrak livery), in a blue and silver color scheme with red accents.
