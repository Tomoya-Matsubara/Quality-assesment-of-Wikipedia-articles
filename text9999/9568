The '''2007 strikes in France''' are a series of [[general strike]]s in [[France]], mostly in the [[public sector]], which started on [[November 13]], [[2007]].<ref name="IHT">{{cite web| author = John Vinocur | title= In November strikes, a direct test of the Sarkozy mettle | publisher=International Herald Tribune | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/11/05/europe/politicus.php | date=[[2007-11-05]]| accessdate=2007-11-06 }}</ref><ref name="Reuters">{{cite web| author = Francois Murphy | title= France braces for crippling transport strike | publisher=Reuters | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL1351805320071113?sp=true | date=[[2007-11-13]]| accessdate=2007-11-13 }}</ref> The strike was over [[President of the French Republic|President]] [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]'s and Prime Minister [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Fillon]]'s attempt to reduce early retirement benefits for 500,000 public employees.

==Cause of the strikes==
France's national labour law permits workers in certain hazardous or difficult professions to retire with full pension benefits after 37.5 years rather than 40 years. The Sarkozy administration claims the current pension system allows some public sector workers to retire as early as age 50.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web | title= French unions strike over reforms | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7093373.stm | date=[[2007-11-13]]| accessdate=2007-11-13 }}</ref> The government calculated the cost of these early-retirement benefits at $7 billion a year.<ref name="Moore">{{cite web | author = Molly Moore | title= Transit Strike Immobilizes France | publisher=Washington Post | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/14/AR2007111400264.html | date=[[2007-11-14]]| accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref>

President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] feels that his victory in the [[French presidential election, 2007|2007 presidential election ]] gave him a mandate to carry out labour reforms, stating "I said before I was elected what I would do," and "We will do these reforms because they have to be done."<ref name="IHT2"/> He declared the strikes a test of political will. "I will pursue these reforms to the end," he said in a speech to the [[European Parliament]]. "Nothing will blow me off course."<ref name="Moore"/>

[[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Fillon]] attacked the unions for depriving millions of French people "of their fundamental freedom<U+2014>the freedom of movement and even perhaps to work."<ref name="Moore"/>

==Beginning of the strikes==
[[Image:Paris Metro 2007 strike - La Defense.png|thumb|300px|Passengers waiting for the next train at the [[La D<U+00E9>fense]] [[Paris M<U+00E9>tro Line 1|M<U+00E9>tro station]]. Access to the station had to be restricted due to overcrowding]]
On [[November 13]], [[2007]], [[SNCF]] rail workers and [[Paris M<U+00E9>tro]] personnel became the first group of workers to commence their strike.<ref name="Reuters"/> Labour Minister [[Xavier Bertrand]] met with union leaders on [[November 14]], [[2007]] to try to find a resolution.<ref name="BBC rail chaos">{{cite web | title= French strike brings travel chaos | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7093373.stm | date=[[2007-11-14]]| accessdate=2007-11-14 }}</ref> On the first day of the strike, only 90 out of 700 [[TGV]] trains were running, and other rail services have also been reduced sharply.<ref name="BBC rail chaos"/> In [[Paris]], the M<U+00E9>tro was only running at 20% capacity and bus services only at 15%.<ref name="BBC rail chaos"/> But some M<U+00E9>tro lines experienced fewer disruptions than expected, leading some observers to conclude that support for the strike was not as strong as unions claimed.<ref name="Bennhold" />  Line 14 of the Paris m<U+00E9>tro, is piloted automatically, and is unaffected by the drivers' strike, thus bringing the percentage up.

30% of the workers of the 70% state owned [[Gaz de France]] and [[<U+00C9>lectricit<U+00E9> de France]], who are also affected by the reform are on strike since [[November 13]], reducing the national electricity production by  8000 [[Watt#Megawatt|MW]] (roughly 10%), however for the moment there are no fears of power cuts.<ref name="BBC" />  The [[Op<U+00E9>ra National de Paris]], which is subject to the special retirement plan (''r<U+00E9>gimes sp<U+00E9>ciaux de retraite'') since [[Louis XIV]] gave them this right, also cancelled performances.  However in a short interview granted to the BBC the director claimed these cancellations were due to insufficient customers, because of travel difficulties incurred by the strikes.  Some university students demonstrated and blocked the entrances to their campuses in opposition to plans to allow private funding of Universities.<ref name="Bennhold" /><ref name="Moore" />  In the University of Nanterre students were forcefully removed by riot police, however this was censored on the national news.  A survey by the pro-Sarkozy newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' and the cable news channel [[La Cha<U+00EE>ne Info|LCI]] released on [[November 13]] found that about 7 out of 10 people said the strikes were unjustified.<ref name="Moore" />

[[Minister of Social Affairs (France)|Minister of Employment, Social Cohesion and Housing]] [[Xavier Bertrand]], whose portfolio includes labor relations, held several negotiating sessions with the unions throughout the day on November 13 and 14.<ref name="Moore" /><ref name="Bennhold2">{{cite web| author = Katrin Bennhold | title= French Strike Continues a Second Day | publisher=New York Times | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/15/world/africa/15cnd-france.html | date=[[2007-11-15]]| accessdate=2007-11-15}}</ref> Bertrand told the unions that pension reform was non-negotiable, but proposed a month-long period of negotiations between the unions and each state-controlled agency to discuss ways to minimize the effects on existing workers.<ref name="Bennhold2" />

Some improvements in mass transit also occurred on [[November 14]]. The main M<U+00E9>tro commuter lines remained shut, while other lines ran between 20 and 50 percent at normal capacity. However, only a third of Paris buses were running. The [[Associated Press]] reported that 150 of the 700 high-speed [[TGV]] trains were running, an increase of 60 over the day before.<ref name="Bennhold2" />

On [[November 18]], a demonstration was held by pro-reform and anti-strikes organizations in Paris. They gathered between 8,000 and 20,000 protesters against public transportation strikers, described as "hostage takers"<ref>''[http://www.latribune.fr/info/Plusieurs-milliers-de-personnes-manifestent-a-Paris-contre-les-greves-dans-les-transports-521-~-AP-PARIS-MANIFESTATION-ANTI-GREVES-$Db=News/News.nsf-$Channel=Economie-$SubChannel=France Plusieurs milliers de personnes manifestent <U+00E0> Paris contre les gr<U+00E8>ves dans les transports]'', [[La Tribune]], 18/11/07</ref>.

[[November 20]] marked the 7th day of striking and strikers were joined by other civil servants including teachers, [[La Poste (France)|postal workers]] and newspaper printers.  The printers were also protesting against reorganisations within the printing industry. <ref name="BBC newspapers">

During the night from [[November 20]] to [[November 21]], the [[TGV]] network was sabotaged by fires, further adding to the delays caused by the 8th day of striking on the 21st.  Approximately 30 kilometres of track were damaged, both the unions and the President have condemned these acts. <ref name"BBC sabotage">

On [[November 21]], the CGT called for the strikes to stop as the government has allegedly agreed to negotiate.  An opinion poll published in the Figaro estimates 2/3rds of the French are against the strike, and the Ministry of Economy has declared the strike is costing the French economy <U+20AC>400 million a day and SNCF <U+20AC>100 million a day.  According to the [[SNCF]], the operator of the national train lines 23% of their staff are still on strike, while the [[RATP]] operating the Paris M<U+00E9>tro, and some suburban trains claims 16% of their staff are on strike.  However the service on the Parisian trains and M<U+00E9>tro is still below 25%, due to the fact that most of the strikers are train drivers.  <ref name="Bloomberg">{{cite web

On [[November 21]] the number of strikers continued to diminish, and talks were engaged in-between the government and the unions.

Strikes continued on [[November 22]] with the numbers of strikers still diminishing, public transport was still heavily affected however.  Following a day of ongoing talks with the government, 42 of the 45 union committees voted to stop the strike, and the [[RATP]] and [[SNCF]] are announcing almost normal service for [[November 23]], with in-between 70 and 100% of public transport services running.  It is said talks could last for a month. <ref name="BBC end of strike">
