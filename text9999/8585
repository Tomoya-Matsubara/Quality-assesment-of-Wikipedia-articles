He helped the [[Brazil national football team|Brazil national team]] win the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] and was one of the most prolific strikers in the world.

He was selected the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] and won the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|World Cup Golden Ball]] in [[1994 in football (soccer)|1994]] and named as one of the [[FIFA 100|Top 125 greatest living footballers]] as part of [[FIFA|FIFA's]] 100th anniversary celebration. He is also known as one of the very few strikers to surpass the mark of 1.000 goals.<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=128880.html Rom<U+00E1>rio completes a famous 1,000] FIFA.com, 21 May 2007</ref>

==Club career==
===Overview===
From very humble origins, Rom<U+00E1>rio was spotted in childhood when playing for [[Olaria Atl<U+00E9>tico Clube|Olaria AC]], a small club from the Rio de Janeiro suburb. He was taken to the junior team of [[Club de Regatas Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]] where he won two state leagues (1987/88) and earned his first call-ups to the national team. Rom<U+00E1>rio came to international attention when he became the top scorer at the [[Football at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympic football tournament]]. 

Shortly after he moved to [[PSV Eindhoven]], where he won the [[Eredivisie|Dutch League]] in 1989, 1991 and 1992. Rom<U+00E1>rio moved to [[Spain]]'s [[FC Barcelona]] for the 1993-1994 season, in which, along with players like [[Hristo Stoichkov]], [[Jos<U+00E9> Mari Bakero]], [[Josep Guardiola]], [[Michael Laudrup]] and [[Ronald Koeman]], he helped the club win the [[Spanish League|League]], while becoming the season's [[Pichichi Trophy|top goalscorer]] with 30 goals in 33 matches.

Rom<U+00E1>rio was named [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] in 1994, after being the runner-up in 1993. In 1995 he returned to Brazil to play for [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]]. He spent the next year in [[Valencia CF|Valencia]]. In 1998, he missed the [[Football World Cup 1998|World Cup]] and then returned to Flamengo until 1999.

He played  for Vasco da Gama again in 2000, winning the [[Copa Mercosur|Mercosur Cup]], the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S<U+00E9>rie A|Brazilian League]], the [[South American Footballer of the Year|South American]] and [[Bola de Ouro|Brazilian Footballer of the Year]] award. From 2002 until 2004 he played for [[Fluminense Football Club|Fluminense]]. On October 21, 2004 he was fired from the club after a conflict with the coach. He then went back to play for the team he started at, Vasco da Gama. In 2005, at nearly 40 years of age, Rom<U+00E1>rio scored 22 goals in the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S<U+00E9>rie A|Brazilian Championship]], making him the league's top goalscorer.

In the beginning of 2006, he joined [[Miami FC]] along with former [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] teammate [[Crizam Cesar de Oliveira Filho|Zinho]]. He helped Miami FC reach their first ever USL First Division Playoffs, scoring 19 league goals in 25 appearances for the team. In the biggest coup of the A-League's short history, Rom<U+00E1>rio was signed by AUFC Board member Mel Patzwald to the Australian [[A-League]] club [[Adelaide United FC]]. He played his first match for [[Adelaide United FC]] on November 25, 2006 against the [[Central Coast Mariners FC]]. After his final game during his short stint on December 15, 2006 he finally scored a goal for Adelaide to end what many considered to be a disappointing spell with the club. In January 2007 he signed a new deal with Vasco da Gama.<ref>[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/060131/1/5ysz.html "Romario still going strong at 40"] - fifaworldcup.yahoo.com, February 2006.</ref>

===One thousandth goal===
On May 20, 2007, Rom<U+00E1>rio scored his 1000th goal, a [[penalty kick]] against [[Sport Recife]], playing for [[Clube de Regatas Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]]. The Brazilian press claimed him as the third player in professional football history to achieve this, after [[Pel<U+00E9>]] and [[Ferenc Pusk<U+00E1>s|Pusk<U+00E1>s]]<ref>[http://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/article.jsp?content=20070520_214652_4128 Romario notches 1,000 goal] Sportnsnet.ca, May 20, 2007</ref> The 1000th goal drew much attention from both Brazilian and international press, with the game being stopped for over 20 minutes to allow for celebrations from his fans.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/SPORT/football/05/21/brazil.romario.reut/index.html Romario nets 1000th goal of career] CNN.com, May 20, 2007</ref><ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/soccer/wires/05/20/2080.ap.la.spt.soc.romario.1000th.goal.2nd.ld.writethru.0522/index.html Rom<U+00E1>rio converts penalty for 1,000th goal] Sports Illustrated, May 20, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/esporte/ult92u115837.shtml Imprensa internacional destaca mil<U+00E9>simo gol de Rom<U+00E1>rio] - Folha Online, May 20, 2007</ref><ref>[http://globoesporte.globo.com/ESP/Home/0,,8168,00.html Rom<U+00E1>rio 1.000 goals] - Globo.com May 20, 2007</ref> There is some controversy over the validity of the 1000 goals as it claim is somewhat inaccurate, because Rom<U+00E1>rio's research team counted his goals in junior, friendly and non-official games.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6472327.stm Controversy on the road to 1,000], BBC News, May 21, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/football.html?in_article_id=456552&in_page_id=1779 Romario writes his own history] - Daily Mail, May 21, 2007</ref>

=== Player/Manager of Vasco da Gama ===
On October 24, 2007, it was announced that Rom<U+00E1>rio would take charge of his first match as the interim manager of [[Club de Regatas Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]] against [[Club Am<U+00E9>rica]] of Mexico in the return leg of their [[Copa Sudamericana]] quarter final and he would also participate on the field as a player. Rom<U+00E1>rio, then 41 years of age, replaced Celso Roth as the manager of Vasco da Gama, and also played the match against [[Club Am<U+00E9>rica]] at the same time. The Vasco da Gama president [[Eurico Miranda]] declared to Globo Online that Rom<U+00E1>rio would be in charge of the team for the match, but it is likely to only be temporarily. On February 6, Romario objected to Miranda's intervention in team selection, so was dismissed, but remained contracted to Vasco as a player. 

On December 4, 2007, Rom<U+00E1>rio announced he had tested positive for [[finasteride]] (aka Propecia) after a match against [[Palmeiras]] on October 28.  He claims it was in an anti-[[baldness]] treatment; however, the drug is banned as it is a [[masking agent]] for [[anabolic steroid]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Romario admits failing drugs test |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=487809&cc=5739&campaign=rss&source=soccernet |publisher=[[ESPNsoccernet]] |date=2007-12-05 |accessdate=2007-12-05 }}</ref>

===Retirement and Comeback===
On February 5, 2008 Rom<U+00E1>rio announced his retirement both from playing and coaching, effective at the end of March. This move came somewhat unexpectedly, as fans anticipated that he would retire from playing, but not coaching. He made it clear that he will only concentrate on the [[Confederations Cup]] and helping with the [[2014 World Cup]]. However, on March 27, Romario denied that he had retired. His contract with Vasco had finished so he is now waiting for proposals from other clubs. It is likely that he will return to play a farewell match, perhaps with [[Club de Regatas Vasco da Gama|Vasco]], [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]] or [[Am<U+00E9>rica Football Club|Am<U+00E9>rica]] (Am<U+00E9>rica is a smaller club from Rio, who Romario's father, Edevair Faria, always supports).

Rom<U+00E1>rio announced on April 15, 2008 at his DVD launch that he would retire from the game of football.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fourfourtwo.com/news/southamerica/7456/default.aspx|title= Brazil legend Romario calls time on career|accessdate=2008-04-15|date=2008-04-15|publisher=FourFourTwo}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7347993.stm|title=Brazil legend Romario ends career|accessdate=2008-04-15|date=2008-04-15|publisher=BBC}}</ref> He cited his weight as a major factor in his decision to retire from the game. Rom<U+00E1>rio played for many clubs that spanned across five continents for over two decades. He scored 71 goals in 85 appearances for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] (including appearances and goals in the Olympics) and claimed to have scored over 1,000 club goals. Rom<U+00E1>rio officially announced his retirement from playing, saying:

<blockquote>"Officially I'm not playing any more. I've stopped," he said. "My time is up. Everything has been a lot of fun." <ref>http://english.aljazeera.net/sport/2008/04/2008615172035382296.html</ref></blockquote>

In August of 2009, Rom<U+00E1>rio announced that he would come out of retirement to play for [[Am<U+00E9>rica Football Club]] from [[Rio de Janeiro]]. He stated that he would play for the club to fulfill his father's wishes.<ref>http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=667380&sec=global&cc=3888</ref>

On November 25th, 2009, Rom<U+00E1>rio made his comeback. Fulfilling his father's wishes, he came on during the 68th minute of the match between Am<U+00E9>rica and Artsul, replacing Adriano. Although he didn't score, Am<U+00E9>rica was able to come forth with a 2-0 win, which led the club to the title of the Second Division of the Carioca Championship.

==National team==
As a member of the [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian national team]], Rom<U+00E1>rio won the silver [[1988 Summer Olympics|Olympic medal in Seoul]] in 1988, scoring seven goals. He was part of the Brazilian squad in the World Cups of [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]. He scored 71 goals in 85 international matches (includes Olympic matches), being the second highest goalscorer in the history of the Brazilian team; only bettered by Pel<U+00E9>. He was a reserve in the 1990 World Cup, playing only 66 minutes in one match, against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. Brazil was eliminated in second round by Argentina.

===1994 World Cup===
In 1992, during Rom<U+00E1>rio's successful season at PSV Eindhoven, he was called to the national team for a friendly match against Germany at 12/16/1992 in Porto Alegre - Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Coach [[Carlos Alberto Parreira]] left Rom<U+00E1>rio as a reserve, after which he expressed his dissatisfaction, saying he would not have come over from Netherlands if he had known he was not going to play. These declarations caused Parreira to ban Rom<U+00E1>rio from the Brazilian team.<ref>[http://www.v-brazil.com/culture/sports/world-cup/1994-United-States.html "Brazil in the 1994 World Cup"] - Virtual-Brazil.com</ref>

Brazil played the first seven matches of the [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification|1994 World Cup qualification]] without Rom<U+00E1>rio, and suffered their first loss ever in World Cup qualifying against [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]]. Journalists and fans called for his return to the team. Brazil had to beat [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] at the [[Est<U+00E1>dio do Maracan<U+00E3>|Maracan<U+00E3> Stadium]] to finish first of their group. Before the match against Uruguay, Parreira gave up and called Rom<U+00E1>rio. Brazil won 2-0, with Rom<U+00E1>rio scoring both goals, and qualified to the World Cup.

At the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|World Cup finals]], he partnered with [[Bebeto]] in the attack to lead his country to a record fourth World Cup title. He scored five goals in the tournament: one in each of the three first round matches, against [[Russia national football team|Russia]], [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]], and [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]; one against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in quarterfinals; and the game-winning header against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] in the semifinals. He also assisted Bebeto in the only goal of the match against the [[USMNT|United States]] in the round of 16. He was voted the most outstanding player of the tournament.

===The ''Ro-Ro'' attack===
In the subsequent years, Rom<U+00E1>rio formed, along with fellow Brazilian forward [[Ronaldo]], a feared attacking combo, which was colloquially referred to as the ''Ro-Ro'' duo. They each scored a [[hat-trick]] in a 6-0 win against [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] in the [[1997 FIFA Confederations Cup]] final.

===1998 and 2002 World Cup absence===
Rom<U+00E1>rio was left out of the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] squad. Medical exams had revealed that he had a muscular injury, and he received intensive treatment leading up to the tournament, but he did not recover completely and was dismissed the day of the deadline for the World Cup squad submissions.<ref name=v-Brazil>[http://www.v-brazil.com/culture/sports/world-cup/1998-France.html "Brazil in the 1998 World Cup" - v-brazil.com]</ref> Brazil lost the World Cup final against hosts [[France national football team|France]].

Prior to the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], Rom<U+00E1>rio, aged 36, was in considerably good form while playing for Fluminense, but once again he was left out of the national squad by coach [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]] due to indiscipline. Brazil went on to win the tournament, beating [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the final.

=== Last game for Brazil ===
On April 28, 2005, Rom<U+00E1>rio played his last game with the Brazilian national team in a friendly and celebratory match. He wore the captain armband and scored the second goal in Brazil's 3-0 win against [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]] and finished off with a yellow card.

== Recognition ==
* [[Johan Cruyff]] defined him as "genius of the goal area".<ref>[http://www.huliq.com/17544/Romario-falls-short-in-quest-of-1-000th-goal Romario falls short in quest of 1,000th goal] HULIQ.com</ref>
* Former [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] international player [[Diego Maradona]], in his autobiography ''Yo soy El Diego'', described Rom<U+00E1>rio as an "incredible finisher" adding that he had not seen a striker like him, and mentioning that Rom<U+00E1>rio would be in his all-time "[[dream team]]" without any hesitation.
* [[Roberto Baggio]] said: "Rom<U+00E1>rio is one of the greatest players of all time. He has good technique and personality. He is a master of art in the penalty area."<ref>[http://www.pro-paul.net/baggio/english/prevupdates/200107.html ROBERTO BAGGIO'S WORLD] Pro-Paul.net, 2001</ref>
* [[Michael Laudrup]] has stated that Romario was his favorite striking partner throughout his career. "No one else could utilize my passes the way he did."

== Footvolley and Beach soccer ==
Since the 1990s Rom<U+00E1>rio has been a [[Footvolley]] enthusiast, playing with friends in various tournaments. In 2006 he won the VIP Footvolley.net Open in [[Miami Beach]], USA. He also plays [[Beach soccer]] and represented Brazil at the [[2005 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup]].

==Personal life==
{{wikiquote}}
Rom<U+00E1>rio is known for his polemic declarations and explosive humour. He is self declared against team concentration during championships, which has led him to disagree with several coaches, including [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]], who rejected him for [[FIFA World Cup 2002]]. He has also been known for missing training.
