It was discovered in 2005 by [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]] and the laser guide star adaptive optics team at the [[W. M. Keck Observatory]], and carried the provisional designation of '''{{mpm-|S/2005 (2003 UB|313|) 1}}''' until officially named  ''Dysnomia''<ref name="IAUC8747">[http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/special/08747.pdf IAU Circular 8747] - Official publication of the [[IAU]] reporting the naming of Eris and Dysnomia (PDF file)</ref> (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word <U+0394><U+03C5><U+03C3><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03BC><U+03AF><U+03B1> meaning "lawlessness") after the [[Dysnomia (mythology)|daughter]] of the Greek goddess [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]].

==Discovery==
During [[2005]], the [[adaptive optics]] team at the [[Keck telescopes]] in [[Hawaii]] carried out observations of the four brightest [[Kuiper belt]] objects ([[Pluto]], {{mpl-|136472|2005 FY|9}}, {{mpl-|136108|2003 EL|61}}, and [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]]), using the newly commissioned [[laser guide star]] adaptive optics system. Observations taken on [[10 September]] revealed a [[natural satellite|moon]] in orbit around Eris, provisionally designated {{mpm-|S/2005 (2003 UB|313|) 1}}. In keeping with the ''[[Xena]]'' nickname that was already in use for Eris, the moon was nicknamed "[[Gabrielle (Xena)|Gabrielle]]" by its discoverers, after the television warrior princess' sidekick.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s1473136.htm|title=Planet Xena has moon called Gabrielle|author=Deborah Zabarenko|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=2005-10-03|accessdate=2008-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s1560563.htm|title='Tenth planet' Xena bigger than Pluto|author=Richard Ingham|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=2006-02-02|accessdate=2008-03-09}}</ref>

==Properties==
The satellite is about 60 times fainter than Eris, and its diameter is estimated to be less than 150 km.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dwarf Planet Outweighs Pluto|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/070614_eris_mass.html |work=space.com|year=2007|accessdate=2007-06-14}}</ref> Combining Keck and Hubble observations, the satellite was used to constrain the mass of Eris, and orbital parameters were estimated. Its orbital period is calculated to be 15.774<U+00B1>0.002 [[day|d]].<ref name=BrownandSchaller2007>{{cite journal | last=Brown |first=M. E. |coauthors=Schaller, E.

==Formation==
Astronomers now know that three of the four brightest [[Kuiper belt objects]] (KBOs) have satellites, while among the fainter members of the belt only about 10% are known to have satellites. This is believed to imply that collisions between large KBOs have been frequent in the past. Impacts between bodies of the order of 1000&nbsp;km across would throw off large amounts of material which would coalesce into a moon. A similar mechanism is believed to have led to the formation of Earth's own [[Moon]] when the [[Earth]] was struck by a [[giant impact hypothesis|giant impactor]] early in the history of the [[solar system]].

==Name==
Mike Brown, the moon's discoverer, chose the name  ''Dysnomia'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] <U+0394><U+03C5><U+03C3><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03BC><U+03AF><U+03B1>) due to a number of resonances it possessed for him. Dysnomia, the daughter of Eris, fits the general historically established pattern of naming moons after lesser gods associated with the primary (hence, Jupiter's largest moons are named after lovers or servants of Jupiter, while Saturn's are named after his fellow Titans). Also, the English translation of "Dysnomia", "lawlessness," echoes [[Lucy Lawless]], the actress famous for starring in ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' on television. Before receiving their official names, Eris and Dysnomia were known informally as "Xena" and "Gabrielle" respectively (Gabrielle being Xena's sidekick), and Brown decided to retain that honour. 

Brown also notes that Pluto owes its name in part to its first two letters, which form the initials of [[Percival Lowell]], the founder of the observatory where its discoverer, [[Clyde Tombaugh]], was working, and the person who inspired the search for "[[Planet X]]." [[James Christy]], who discovered [[Charon (moon)|Charon]], followed the principle established with [[Pluto]] by choosing a name which shared its first four letters with his wife's name, Charlene. "Dysnomia", similarly, has the same first letter as Brown's wife, Diane.<ref name="SkyTel">{{cite news | last = Tytell | first = David | title = All Hail Eris and Dysnomia | publisher = Sky & Telescope | date = 2006-09-14 | url = http://skytonight.com/news/home/3916126.html | accessdate = 2006-12-30 }}</ref> Brown pronounces the name "d<U+0430><U+026A>s<U+02C8>no<U+028A>mi<U+0259>", with a long "i".<ref>{{cite web|title= Julia Sweeney and Michael E.

In addition, both Eris and Dysnomia, representing conflict, reflect the effect their existence had in the disputation on the definition of a planet, and specifically on Pluto's status as such.
