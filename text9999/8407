'''Peru''' ({{lang-es|Per<U+00FA>}}, {{lang-qu|Piruw}}, {{lang-ay|Piruw}}), officially the '''Republic of Peru''' ({{Audio-es|Rep<U+00FA>blica del Per<U+00FA>|Es - Rep<U+00FA>blica del Per<U+00FA>.ogg}}, {{IPA2|re'pu.<U+03B2>li.ka del pe'<U+027E>u}}), is a [[country]] in western [[South America]]. It is bordered on the north by [[Ecuador]] and [[Colombia]], on the east by [[Brazil]], on the southeast by [[Bolivia]], on the south by [[Chile]], and on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]].

Peruvian territory was home to the [[Norte Chico civilization]], one of the oldest in the world, and to the [[Inca Empire]], the largest state in [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Americas|America]]. It was conquered by the [[Spanish Empire]] in the [[16th-century]], which established a [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Viceroyalty]] with jurisdiction over most of its South American domains. [[Independence of Peru|Independence]] was declared on 1821 but consolidated only after the [[Battle of Ayacucho]], three years later.

Peru is a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] divided into [[Administrative divisions of Peru|25 regions]]. Its geography varies from the arid plains of the coast of the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the high mountain peaks of the [[Andes]] mountain range and the tropical forests of the [[Amazon Basin]]. It is a [[developing country]] with a moderate [[Human Development Index]] score and a level of [[poverty]] of around 50%. Main economic activities include [[agriculture]], [[fishing]], [[mining]] and [[manufacturing]] of products such as [[textile]]s. 

Peru is a [[multiethnic society|multiethnic nation]] formed by the combination of different [[ethnic groups]] over five centuries. This mixture has resulted in a wide diversity of cultural expressions in fields such as art, cuisine, literature and music. The country has also a rich [[cultural heritage]], which includes the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] of [[Machu Picchu]].

==History==
{{main|History of Peru}}

Andean Peru is recognized as one of only six areas of [[Civilization#Development of early civilizations|indigenous development of civilization]] in the world and one of only two in the [[Western Hemisphere]], along with [[Mesoamerica]]. The earliest such developments are associated with the [[Norte Chico civilization|Caral]] [[archaeological site]], dated to around 3,200 years BC.<ref>Jonathan Haas et al, "Dating the Late Archaic occupation of the Norte Chico region in Peru".</ref> They were followed by [[archaeological culture|cultures]] such as [[Chav<U+00ED>n culture|Chavin]], [[Paracas culture|Paracas]], [[Mochica Culture|Mochica]], [[Ica-Nazca culture|Nazca]], [[Huari Culture|Wari]] and [[Chim<U+00FA> Culture|Chimu]]. In the [[15th-century]], the [[Incas]] emerged as a powerful state, which formed the largest [[empire]] in [[Pre-Columbian America]] in the span of a century.<ref>Franklin Pease, ''Los Incas: una introducci<U+00F3>n'', p. 49.</ref> Andean societies were based on [[agriculture]], developed through the use of [[irrigation]] and [[Terrace (agriculture)|terracing]] among other techniques. [[Animal husbandry|Husbandry]] of [[camelid]]s and [[fishing]] were also important economic activities. Social organization relied on [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] and [[redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistribution]], as there was no notion of [[market]] or [[money]].<ref>Franklin Pease, ''Los Incas: una introducci<U+00F3>n'', pp. 57-58.</ref>

[[Image:Francisco de Toledo.JPG|thumb|left|Francisco de Toledo, ninth Viceroy of Peru.]]
In 1532, a group of ''[[conquistador]]s'' led by [[Francisco Pizarro]] [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|defeated Inca Emperor]] [[Atahualpa]] and imposed [[Spain|Spanish]] domination. In 1542 the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]] established the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] with jurisdiction over most of its [[dependent territory|dependencies]] in [[South America]]. The country was reorganized in the 1570s under the leadership of [[Viceroy]] [[Francisco de Toledo]] with [[silver mining]] as the basic economic activity and [[Amerindian|Indian]] [[Mita (Inca)|forced labor]] as the primary [[workforce]]. [[Precious metal|Bullion]] produced this way provided considerable revenues for the Spanish Crown and fueled a complex trade network controlled by [[merchant]]s from Lima which extended to Europe and other parts of the world.<ref>Margarita Su<U+00E1>rez, ''Desaf<U+00ED>os transatl<U+00E1>nticos'', pp. 252-253.</ref>

[[Image:San martin independence.jpg|thumb|right|Independence was proclaimed by Jos<U+00E9> de San Mart<U+00ED>n in 1821.]]
By the [[18th-century]], Royal income from silver production had diminished considerably due to widespread [[smuggling]] and [[tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax evasion]].<ref>Margarita Su<U+00E1>rez, ''Comercio y fraude en el Per<U+00FA> colonial'', pp. 23-28.</ref> In reaction to such developments, common throughout the Americas, and to the growing concern over the vulnerability of its colonies, the Crown enacted a series of [[edict]]s collectively known as the [[Bourbon Reforms]].<ref>John Fisher, ''El Per<U+00FA> Borb<U+00F3>nico, 1750-1824'', p. 62.</ref> Taxes were increased and the viceroyalty was [[partition]]ed in order to create the viceroyalties of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|Nueva Granada]] and [[Viceroyalty of the R<U+00ED>o de la Plata|R<U+00ED>o de la Plata]]. The new laws alienated various social groups and provoked [[rebellion|revolts]] including the rebellion of [[T<U+00FA>pac Amaru II]] in 1780,<ref>John Fisher, ''El Per<U+00FA> Borb<U+00F3>nico, 1750-1824'', p. 175.</ref> but all of them were defeated. In the early [[19th-century]], while most of South America was swept by [[South American wars of independence|wars of independence]] Peru remained a [[royalist]] stronghold. The [[elite]] hesitated between emancipation and loyalty to the Spanish Monarch thus, [[independence of Peru|independence]] was only achieved after the military campaigns of [[Jos<U+00E9> de San Mart<U+00ED>n]] and [[Sim<U+00F3>n Bol<U+00ED>var]].<ref>Timothy Anna, ''La ca<U+00ED>da del gobierno espa<U+00F1>ol en el Per<U+00FA>'', pp. 310-311.</ref>

[[Image:Angamos.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Angamos|Angamos]], a decisive battle during the War of the Pacific.]]
The early years of the Republic were marked by endemic struggles between military ''[[caudillo]]s''.<ref>Crist<U+00F3>bal Aljov<U+00ED>n, ''Caudillos y constituciones'', pp. 40-45.</ref> They were also a period of [[nation|national identity]] definition as [[Sim<U+00F3>n Bol<U+00ED>var|Bolivarian]] projects for a [[Congress of Panama|Latin American Confederation]] foundered and a [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation|union with Bolivia]] proved ephemeral.<ref>Jorge Basadre, ''Historia de la Rep<U+00FA>blica del Per<U+00FA>'', vol. II, p. 119.</ref> During the mid-19th century, Peru enjoyed several years of stability under the leadership of [[Ram<U+00F3>n Castilla]] thanks to a fiscal bonanza sustained on [[guano]] exports.<ref>Carmen Mc Evoy, ''La utop<U+00ED>a republicana'', pp. 24-25.</ref> However, by the 1870s, these resources had been dilapidated, the country was heavily indebted and political infighting was again on the rise.<ref>Jorge Basadre, ''Historia de la Rep<U+00FA>blica del Per<U+00FA>'', vol. VI, pp. 44-46.</ref> Under these conditions, Per<U+00FA> was defeated by [[Chile]] in the [[War of the Pacific]] and lost [[Arica Province|Arica]] and [[Tarapac<U+00E1> Region|Tarapac<U+00E1>]]. Internal struggles after the war were followed by a period of stability associated to the predominance of the [[Civilista Party]],<ref>Manuel Burga and Alberto Flores Galindo, ''Apogeo y crisis de la Rep<U+00FA>blica Aristocr<U+00E1>tica'', p. 84.</ref> which lasted until the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[regime]] of [[Augusto B. Legu<U+00ED>a]] and the irruption into politics of the [[middle class]]es.<ref>Jorge Basadre, ''Historia de la Rep<U+00FA>blica del Per<U+00FA>'', vol. X, p. 35.</ref> 

The [[Great Depression]] caused the downfall of Legu<U+00ED>a, followed by renewed political turmoil and the emergence of the [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]] (APRA).<ref>Julio Cotler, ''Clases, estado y naci<U+00F3>n en el Per<U+00FA>'', pp. 227-231.</ref> The rivalry between this organization and a coalition of the elite and the [[Military of Peru|military]] was the main feature of Peruvian politics for the following three decades. In 1968, after the failure of the reformist government of [[Fernando Bela<U+00FA>nde Terry|Fernando Belaunde]], the Armed Forces staged a coup led by [[General]] [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]].<ref>Henry Pease, ''El ocaso de la oligarqu<U+00ED>a'', pp. 34-45.</ref> The new regime undertook radical reforms aimed at fostering development but, despite its [[populism|populist rhetoric]], failed to gain widespread support.<ref>George Philip, ''The rise and fall of the Peruvian military radicals'', pp. 163-165.</ref> In 1975, Velasco was forcefully replaced as president by General [[Francisco Morales Berm<U+00FA>dez]], who paralyzed reforms and oversaw a return to [[democracy|democratic practices]].<ref>Daniel Masterson, ''Fuerza armada y sociedad en el Per<U+00FA> moderno'', pp. 366-372.</ref> 

During the 1980s, Peru faced a huge [[external debt]], an ever-growing [[inflation]], a surge in [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]] and [[Internal conflict in Peru|massive political violence]] derived from the actions of [[insurgent]] groups [[Shining Path]] and [[T<U+00FA>pac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]].<ref>Carlos Contreras and Marcos Cueto, ''Historia del Per<U+00FA> contempor<U+00E1>neo'', pp. 347-361.</ref> [[Alberto Fujimori]] was elected president in 1990; two years later he [[Peruvian Constitutional Crisis of 1992|dissolved Parliament]] and convened a [[Democratic Constitutional Congress]], which drafted a new [[Constitution of Peru|Constitution]]. Under his presidency, the economy started to recover, however, accusations of [[authoritarianism]], [[corruption]] and [[Human rights violation#Violations of human rights|human rights violations]] forced his resignation after the controversial [[Peruvian general election, 2000|2000 elections]].<ref>Carlos Contreras and Marcos Cueto, ''Historia del Per<U+00FA> contempor<U+00E1>neo'', pp. 397-398.</ref>

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Peru}}

[[Image:Map of Peru Demis.png|thumb|left|Topographic map of Peru.]]
The territory of Peru covers 1,285,220&nbsp;[[square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]] (496,193&nbsp;[[square miles|mi<U+00B2>]]), which makes it the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|20th-largest country]] in the world, comparable to [[Chad]] and double the size of the state of [[Texas]]. It neighbors [[Ecuador]] and [[Colombia]] to the north, [[Brazil]] to the east, [[Bolivia]] to the southeast, [[Chile]] to the south, and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west. 

The [[Andes]] [[mountain range]] runs parallel to the Pacific Ocean, dividing the country in three geographic regions. The ''costa'' (coast), to the west, is a narrow [[coastal plain|plain]] most of which is [[arid]] except for a number of [[valley]]s created by seasonal [[river]]s. The ''sierra'' (highlands) comprises the Andes themselves, its territory combines [[massif]]s, [[canyon]]s and [[plateau]]s. It includes the highest point of the country, [[Huascar<U+00E1>n]] mountain at 6,768 [[meters above sea level]],<ref>AndesHandbook, [http://www.andeshandbook.cl/default.asp?main=cerro.asp?codigo=54 ''Huascar<U+00E1>n'']. Retrieved on [[May 15]], [[2007]].</ref> as well as the ''[[Altiplano]]'' plateau. The ''selva'' (jungle), to the east, is a wide expanse of flat terrain covered by the [[Amazon rainforest]] extending up to the border with Brazil. Nearly 60% of national territory is in this region.<ref>Instituto de Estudios Hist<U+00F3>rico-Mar<U+00ED>timos del Per<U+00FA>, ''El Per<U+00FA> y sus recursos: Atlas geogr<U+00E1>fico y econ<U+00F3>mico'', p. 16.</ref>

[[Image:Huallaga River.jpg|thumb|right|The Huallaga river forms part of the Amazon basin.]]
Rivers that run through Peruvian territory are divided into three [[drainage basin|basins]]. Those that drain towards the Pacific Ocean are characterized by their short length, steep gradient and intermittent flow. [[Tributary|Tributaries]] of the [[Amazon River]] are longer, have a much larger flow and low gradient once they exit the Andes. Finally, rivers that drain in [[Lake Titicaca]] are characterized by their short length and large flow.<ref>Instituto de Estudios Hist<U+00F3>rico-Mar<U+00ED>timos del Per<U+00FA>, ''El Per<U+00FA> y sus recursos: Atlas geogr<U+00E1>fico y econ<U+00F3>mico'', p. 31.</ref> They form part of an [[endorheic basin]], as it has no outlet to the sea. The largest rivers of the country are, in descending order, [[Ucayali]], [[Mara<U+00F1><U+00F3>n River (Peru)|Mara<U+00F1><U+00F3>n]], [[I<U+00E7><U+00E1>|Putumayo]], [[Yavar<U+00ED> River|Yavar<U+00ED>]], [[Huallaga River|Huallaga]], [[Urubamba River|Urubamba]], [[Mantaro River|Mantaro]] and [[Amazon River|Amazon]], all of them part of the [[Amazon Basin]].<ref>Instituto Nacional de Estad<U+00ED>stica e Inform<U+00E1>tica, ''Per<U+00FA>: Compendio Estad<U+00ED>stico 2005'', p. 13.</ref> 

[[Image:Condor flying over the Colca canyon in Peru.jpg|thumb|A [[condor]] flying over the [[Colca Canyon]] in the Arequipa Region.]]
[[Climate]] is influenced by proximity to the [[Equator]], the presence of the Andes and the cold waters of the [[Humboldt Current]]. The combination of this factors make for a wide climate diversity ranging from the dryness of the coast to the extreme cold of mountain peaks to the heavy rainfall of the Amazon Basin. The varied geography and climate of Peru account for its high [[biodiversity]] with 21,462 [[species]] of plants and animals reported as of 2003, 5,855 of them [[endemism|endemic]].<ref>Instituto Nacional de Estad<U+00ED>stica e Inform<U+00E1>tica, ''Per<U+00FA>: Compendio Estad<U+00ED>stico 2005'', p. 50.</ref> For their preservation, the Government has established several [[list of national parks in Peru|protected area]]s.

[[Economic policy]] has varied widely over the last decades, the government of [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]] introduced radical reforms, which included an [[agrarian reform]], the [[nationalization|expropriation]] of foreign companies, the introduction of a [[economic interventionism|planning system]] and the creation of a large [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned sector]].

In 2006, the GDP grew 7.7%, and it is expected to grow 6.5% in 2007 and 6% for five years after 2008.

Peru is a [[multiethnic society|multiethnic nation]] formed by the combination of different [[ethnic groups]] over five centuries. [[Indigenous Peoples in Peru|Amerindians]] inhabited Peruvian territory for several millennia before the Spanish Conquest in the 16th-century. [[Infectious disease]]s, [[famine]], [[war]] and [[exploitation]] brought their number down from an estimated 9 million in the 1520s to around 600,000 in 1620.<ref>Noble David Cook, ''Demographic collapse: Indian Peru, 1520-1620'', p. 114.</ref> [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] and [[Black people|Africans]] arrived in large number under colonial rule, these three groups have mixed widely over the years.

The main language of the Peruvian population is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] which, according to the 1993 census, was the [[First language|mother tongue]] of 80.3% Peruvians age 5 and older. It coexists with several indigenous languages, the most important of which is [[Quechua]], spoken by 16.5%.

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Peru}}

[[Image:Peru Machu Picchu Sunrise 2.jpg|thumb|left|Machu Picchu, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].]]
Peruvian culture is a fusion of the different traditions that have converged in its territory over several centuries. Main imputs have been provided by Amerindian inhabitants as well as Spanish colonizers that arrived after Conquest. Other important influences have been made by various ethnic groups from Africa, Asia and Europe. [[Arts and entertainment in Peru|Artistic traditions]] span several millennia, starting with the elaborate examples of [[pottery]], [[textile]]s, [[jewelry]], and [[sculpture]] of [[Pre-Inca cultures]]. The Incas maintained these crafts and made impressive achievements in architecture, for example, [[Machu Picchu]].

[[Image:Catedrallima.jpg|thumb|The [[Lima Cathedral|Cathedral of Lima]], an example of colonial religious art.]] 
After the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish Conquest]], [[Baroque]], influenced by native traditions, became the dominant art style. Most artistic creations were devoted towards religious subjects as can be seen in the paintings of the ''Escuela Cusque<U+00F1>a'' and in the numerous churches built during this time. Colonial traditions were replaced after Independence by modern European styles such as [[Neoclassicism]] until the emergence of ''Indigenismo'' in the early 20th century. In more recent times, Peruvian art has been characterised by its [[eclecticism]] with foreign art currents intermingling with local developments.

[[Peruvian literature]] can be traced back to the [[oral tradition]]s of [[Pre-Columbian]] civilizations; [[writing]] was introduced with the arrival of Spaniards in the [[16th century]]. Colonial forms of literary expression included [[chronicle]]s and [[Christian literature|religious literature]]. After independence it developed along the lines of European currents such as Neoclassicism and [[Romanticism]]. By the early 20th century new developments had arisen as part of the ''Indigenismo'' movement. During the second half of that century, Peruvian literature became more widely known thanks to authors such as [[Mario Vargas Llosa]].

[[Image:Ceviche from Peru.jpg|thumb|right|''Ceviche'' is made out of seafood marinated in lemon juice.]]
In recent years, [[Peruvian cuisine]] has received widespread acclaim by the international media thanks to its diversity of ingredients and techniques.<ref>Embassy of Peru in the United States, [http://www.peruvianembassy.us/all-about-peru-the-culture-peruvian-gastronomy.php ''The Peruvian Gastronomy'']. Retrieved on [[May 15]], [[2007]]</ref> It is a blend of [[Native American cuisine#Native American cuisine of South America|Amerindian]] and [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish food]] with strong influences from other groups such as Africans, Arabs, Italians, Chinese and Japanese, all of which have added their own traditions to the mix. Climate diversity allows the production of a wide variety of plants and animals, both [[indigenous (ecology)|native]] and [[introduced species|introduced]]. Common dishes include ''[[anticuchos]]'', ''[[ceviche]]'', ''[[humita]]s'', and ''[[pachamanca]]'' to name just a few.

[[Music of Peru|Peruvian music]] is very diverse, with Andean, Spanish and African roots. In Prehispanic times, musical expressions varied widely from region to region, [[Musical instrument|instruments]] employed included the ''[[quena]]'' and the ''[[tinya]]''. New instruments were introduced after the Spanish conquest, such as [[guitar]]s and [[harp]]s. This also prompted the appearance of crossbred instruments like the ''[[charango]]''. There is an African contribution in [[rhythm]]s and in ''[[Cajon|caj<U+00F3>n]]'', a [[percussion instrument]]. As for [[folk dance]]s, most renowned examples include ''[[Marinera Norte<U+00F1>a]]'', ''[[Tondero]]'' and ''[[Huayno]]''. In recent decades, [[urbanization]] has influenced traditional Andean expressions, further adding to Peruvian musical diversity.<ref>Ra<U+00FA>l Romero, ''La m<U+00FA>sica tradicional y popular'', p. 217.</ref>
