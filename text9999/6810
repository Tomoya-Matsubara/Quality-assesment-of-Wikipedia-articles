A '''BLT cocktail''' is a cocktail made out of the contents of a [[BLT]] sandwich, ([[bacon]], [[lettuce]] and [[tomato]]), blended together with [[vodka]]. Variants on the drink include utilizing [[bacon vodka]] instead of traditional vodka, substituting [[liquor]] for lettuce, incorporating [[bacon salt]], or including [[cucumber]] flavored vodka.

The drink gained popularity in the [[United States]] in 2009. Varieties of the beverage were served in regions including [[Colorado]], [[Florida]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Missouri]], [[Oregon]], and [[Virginia]]. It has also achieved notice in [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

[[Frank Bruni]], the chief restaurant critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', gave a favorable review in 2007 to a BLT cocktail made by chef [[Gordon Ramsay]]. An [[Associated Press]] review in 2009 of the BLT cocktail made by [[mixologist]] Todd Thrasher of [[Alexandria, Virginia]] described it as "a drink full of mind-bending, taste bud-tingling turns".<ref name="meatydrink" /> Food critics have given the beverage favorable reviews in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[The Times]]'' of [[London]], and the [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]-based newspaper ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.
