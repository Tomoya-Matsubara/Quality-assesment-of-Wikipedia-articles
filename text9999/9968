==First African-American All-American football player at Michigan==

Franks, who was born in [[Macon, Georgia]] and raised in {{city-state|Hamtramck|Michigan}},<ref name=WMU/> was named to the {{city-state|Detroit|Michigan}}, all-city team after the 1939 high school football season.<ref name=MWHYG/>  He is the son of Julius Franks, Sr. and Nellie Mae Solomon and father of Daryl, Cheryl, Bobby, Beverly A Grant, Fredrick.<ref name=WWAAA/> After graduating from high school, he attended the University of Michigan, where he became the third African-American to play for the Michigan Wolverines football team.  In 1942, he became the first African-American at Michigan to earn All-American honors.<ref name=MWHYG/>  He is described as the second to be All-American by some accounts.<ref name=WMU/><ref name=JFBentley/>  Head coach [[Fritz Crisler]] said Franks was one of the hardest-working players he ever coached.<ref name=MWHYG/>  The 1942 Wolverines' offensive line, which included Franks, [[Al Wistert]], Robert Kolesar, [[Merv Pregulman]], and [[Elmer Madar]], was known as the "Seven Oak Posts".<ref name=JFBentley>{{cite web|url=http://www.bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fballam/aafranks.htm|title=University of Michigan Football All-American: Julius Franks|publisher=The Regents of the University of Michigan|date=2007-01-10|accessdate=2007-11-26}}</ref>  Franks credited the group's success to [[Exhibition game|scrimmaging]] as rookies against the 1940 offense that included [[Tom Harmon]], [[Forest Evashevski]], and [[Bob Westfall]].  Franks was played all 60 minute in his games as a junior in 1942 and was named a first-team All American.<ref name=JFBentley/>  

In 1943, Franks and teammate Tom Kuzma came down with [[tuberculosis]] and were hospitalized at [[University of Michigan Health System|University Hospital]] for 25 months as they recuperated.  Franks recalled that [[head coach]] [[Fritz Crisler]] was a regular visitor to his hospital room, and team star [[Tom Harmon]] also stopped to visit while on leave from military service.  As a result of the hospitalization, Franks missed his senior year as a football player.<ref name=MWHYG/>  He obtained his [[bachelor of science]] degree in 1947.<ref name=WWAAA/>

In 1982, Franks was named to the University of Michigan Hall of Honor in the fifth class of inductees that was inducted in 1983.  He was the twelfth Michigan football player to earn this honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.letterwinnersmclub.com/hallofhonor.html|title=Hall of Honor|publisher=M Club|accessdate=2007-11-26}}</ref>

==Professional career and community service==

In 1951,<ref name=WWAAA/> Franks earned his [[D.D.S.]] from the University of Michigan Dental School, and practiced [[dentistry]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] for more than 40 years.  Franks was a leader in the [[Urban League]], [[United Way of America|United Way]], [[American Red Cross]], [[Boy Scouts of America]], and [[Rotary Club]].  In 1964, [[Michigan Governor]] [[George Romney]] appointed Franks to [[Western Michigan University]]'s first Board of Trustees, where he served as a trustee until 1983.<ref name=WMU/> Franks served on several boards: Executive Comunication, Vice President, President, 1951&ndash;87; [[Kent County, Michigan|Kent County]] Dental Society, 1951&ndash;92; Michigan & American Dental Association, 1951&ndash;96; trustee, Western Michigan University, 1964&ndash;82 (trustee emeritus, 1983); Director, Boulevard Memorial Medical Center, 1974&ndash;84; Director, United Way Kent County, 1987&ndash;92.<ref name=WWAAA/> In 1992, Franks contracted [[Guillain-Barr<U+00E9> syndrome]], which forced him into retirement.<ref name=MWHYG/>

In the 1960s, Franks helped to [[integration|integrate]] Grand Rapids.  In the early 1960s, African Americans were not welcome in Grand Rapids' "white" [[middle-class]] neighborhoods, and [[real estate broker|real estate agent]]s would not show them houses.   In 1962, Franks' friend, J.E. Adams, found vacant land designated as a potential park site.  Adams, Franks, and friends Joesph Lee and Samuel Triplett created a plan to purchase the {{convert|20|acre|m2|0|lk=on}} site and build a middle-class neighborhood for African-Americans.  The announcement "caused an uproar that resulted in protests, lawsuits and threats."  When banks refused to finance the project, the four men purchased the land on their own for [[U.S. Dollar|$]]60,000 and started building. The first of 51 houses was completed in 1965. Today, the neighborhood, known as Auburn Hills (not to be confused with {{city-state|Auburn Hills|Michigan}}), has a population of 542 and the lowest crime rate in Grand Rapids.<ref name=WMU/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grmag.com/features/08-07/08-07.htm|title=A City of Neighbors|accessdate=2007-11-27|publisher=Gemini Publications|author=Brown, Josh, Sara Cosgrove, Emily Rattray
