'''Keith Hector Elias''' (born February 3, 1972 in [[Lacey Township, New Jersey]]) is a former [[American football]] [[running back]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and [[Xtreme Football League]] (XFL).  He was an All-American in high school and college where he established school, conference and national records while playing for the [[Princeton Tigers football]] team.

In high school, he earned All-American honors for Lacey Township.  In college, he did so again for [[Princeton University]], where he established 21 school records in football from 1991 through 1993. His college career coincided in the [[Ivy League]] with [[Jay Fiedler]] who led [[Dartmouth Big Green football|Dartmouth]] to three championships in that era, but Elias was able to lead Princeton to one co-championship.  Elias and Fiedler split the League Player of the Year Awards during that era.   He is the former [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS, called I-AA at the time) recordholder for career rushing yards per game and [[point (American football)|points]] per game.  He also established the FCS record for back-to-back games total rushing yards.  He continues to hold numerous [[Ivy League]] and Princeton Tiger's rushing and scoring records.

Elias was signed as a [[free agent]] out of college by the [[New York Giants]] where he played from [[1994 NFL season|1994]] throught [[1996 NFL season|1996]].  He served mostly on [[special teams]].  He last played in the NFL two seasons with the [[Indianapolis Colts]] in [[1998 NFL season|1998]] and [[1999 NFL season|1999]].   Elias also played for the [[New York/New Jersey Hitmen]] of the now defunct [[XFL]].
