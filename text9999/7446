'''SM ''U-40''''' or '''''U-XL''''' was a [[U-27 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-27'' class]] [[U-boat]] or [[submarine]] for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]]. ''U-40'', built by the Austrian firm of [[Cantiere Navale Triestino]] (CNT) at the [[Pola Navy Yard]], was [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed in April 1917 and [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed in August.

She had a single [[submarine hull|hull]] and was just over {{convert|121|ft|m}} in length. She [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] nearly {{convert|265|MT|LT|0}} when surfaced and over {{convert|300|MT|LT|0}} when submerged. Her two [[diesel engine]]s moved her at up to {{convert|9|knots|km/h}} on the surface, while her twin [[electric motor]]s propelled her at up to {{convert|7.5|knots|km/h}} while underwater. She was armed with two bow [[torpedo tube]]s and could carry a load of up to four torpedoes. She was also equipped with a {{convert|75|mm|in|1|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[deck gun]] and a [[machine gun]].

During her service career, ''U-40'' sank three ships and damaged two others, sending a combined tonnage of {{GRT|9,838|first=short}} to the bottom. ''U-40'' was at [[Fiume]] at war's end and was surrendered at [[Venice]] in March 1919. She was granted to Italy as a [[war reparation]] and broken up the following year. 

== Design and construction ==
[[Austria-Hungary]]'s U-boat fleet was largely obsolete at the outbreak of [[World War I]].<ref name=Con-341>Gardiner, p. 341.</ref> The [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] satisfied its most urgent needs by purchasing five [[German Type UB I submarine|Type UB I]] submarines that comprised the {{sclass|U-10|submarine|4}} from Germany,<ref name=Con-343>Gardiner, p. 343.</ref> by raising and recommissioning the sunken French submarine [[French submarine Curie (Q 87)|''Curie'']] as {{SMS|U-14|Austria-Hungary|2|sub=y}},<ref name=Con-341 /><ref group=Note>[[French submarine Curie (Q 87)|''Curie'']] had been caught in an [[anti-submarine net]] while trying to enter the harbor at [[Pula|Pola]] on 20 December 1914. See: Gardiner, p. 343.</ref> and by building four submarines of the {{sclass|U-20|submarine|4}} that were based on the 1911 Danish [[Havmanden class submarine (1911)|''Havmanden'' class]].<ref name=Con-344>Gardiner, p. 344.</ref><ref group=Note>The plans for the Danish [[Havmanden class submarine (1911)|''Havmanden'' class submarines]], three of which were built in Austria-Hungary, were seized from [[Whitehead & Co.]] in [[Fiume]]. See: Gardiner, pp. 344, 354.</ref>

After these steps alleviated their most urgent needs,<ref name=Con-341 /> the Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the [[German Type UB II submarine|German Type UB II]] design for its newest submarines in mid 1915.<ref name=Hal-383>Halpern, p. 383.</ref> The Germans were reluctant to allocate any of their wartime resources to Austro-Hungarian construction, but were willing to sell plans for up to six of the UB II boats to be constructed under license in Austria-Hungary.<ref name=Hal-383 /> The Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from [[AG Weser]] of [[Bremen]].<ref name=BS>Baumgartner and Sieche, as excerpted [http://www.gwpda.org/naval/ahsubs.htm here] (reprinted and translated into English by Sieche).

''U-40'' displaced {{convert|264|MT|LT}} surfaced and {{convert|301|MT|LT}} submerged.<ref name=Con-344 /> She had a single [[submarine hull|hull]] with [[saddle tank]]s,<ref name=Con-181>Gardiner, p. 181.</ref> and was {{convert|121|ft|1|in|m}} long with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|14|ft|4|in|m}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|12|ft|2|in|m}}.<ref name=Con-344 /> For propulsion, she had two shafts, twin [[diesel engine]]s of {{convert|270|bhp|abbr=on}} for surface running, and twin [[electric motor]]s of {{convert|280|shp|abbr=on}} for submerged travel. She was capable of {{convert|9|knots|km/h|1}} while surfaced and {{convert|7.5|knots|km/h}} while submerged.<ref name=Con-344 /> Although there is no specific notation of a range for ''U-40'' in ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906<U+2013>1921'', the German UB II boats, upon which the ''U-27'' class was based, had a range of over {{convert|6000|nmi|km}} at {{convert|5|knots|km/h}} surfaced, and {{convert|45|nmi|km}} at {{convert|4|knots|km/h}} submerged.<ref name=Con-181 /> ''U-27''-class boats were designed for a crew of 23<U+2013>24.<ref name=Con-344 />

''U-40'' was armed with two {{convert|45|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} bow [[torpedo tube]]s and could carry a complement of four torpedoes. She was also equipped with a 75<U+00A0>mm/26 (3.0<U+00A0>in) [[deck gun]] and an {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]].<ref name=Con-344 />

''U-40'' was ordered from [[Cantiere Navale Triestino]] (CNT) after funds for her purchase were raised and donated to the Austro-Hungarian Navy by the ''<U+00D6>stereichischen Flottenverein''.<ref name=Con-344 /> She was [[keel laying|laid down]] on 8 August 1916 at the [[Pola Navy Yard]],<ref name=Tengeral /><ref group=Note>By this time, the [[Cantiere Navale Triestino|CNT]] shipyards at [[Monfalcone]] had been overrun by the [[Italian Army]].

== Service career ==
''U-40'' underwent diving trials on 3 July 1917, successfully reaching a depth of {{convert|50|m|ft}}.<ref name=Tengeral /> One mont later, on 4 August, the SM ''U-40'' was [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed into the Austro-Hungarian Navy under the command of ''Linenschiffleutnant'' Johann Krsnjavi.<ref name=KUK-U-40 /> Previously in command of {{SMS|U-11|Austria-Hungary|2|sub=y}}, Krsnjavi was a 30-year-old native of [[Djakovo]] (the present-day <U+0110>akovo in [[Croatia]]).<ref name=Krsnjavi>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = WWI U-boat commanders: Johann Krsnjavi | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/men/commanders/518.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | date =  | accessdaymonth = 20 January | accessyear = 2009 }}</ref>

''U-40'' departed on her first patrol on 5 August, sailing through the [[Brijuni|Brioni]] islands. Two days out, the submarine came under attack by two airplanes. Bombs from the two aircraft damaged one of ''U-40''{{'}}s fuel tanks but the U-boat was able to continue to her Mediterranean patrol area. There, east of [[Malta]], she unsuccessfully attacked a steamer on the 15th. Four days later<U+2014>a little more than two weeks after the U-boat's commissioning<U+2014>Krsnjavi and ''U-40'' achieved their first kills. ''Gartness'', a British steamer of {{GRT|2,422|first=yes}}, was transporting manganese ore, lean, and arsenic from [[Ergasteria]] for [[Middlesbrough]] when torpedoed by ''U-40'' some {{convert|140|nmi|km}} southeast of Malta.<ref name=gart>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Gartness | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/2382.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | date =  | accessdaymonth = 21 January | accessyear = 2009 }}</ref> The ship's [[captain (nautical)|master]] and twelve other crewmen were killed in the attack.<ref name=Tenn-229>Tennent, p. 229.</ref>

Ten days later, after a rendezvous with [[sister boat]] {{SMS|U-32|Austria-Hungary|2|sub=y}} in the [[Ionian Sea]],<ref name=Tengeral /> ''U-40'' damaged the [[collier (ship)|collier]] ''Clifftower'' in an torpedo attack. ''Clifftower'', carrying a load of coal from [[Newcastle]], suffered no casualties in the attack.<ref name=cliff>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Clifftower | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/1357.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | date =  | accessdaymonth = 21 January | accessyear = 2009 }}</ref> After successfully passing through the [[Otranto Barrage]] on 31 August, ''U-40'' concluded her first patrol when she docked at [[Cattaro]] on 3 September.<ref name=Tengeral />

On 15 October, ''U-40'' set out from Cattaro on her next patrol. She spent two days, 16 to 18 October, patrolling off [[Durazzo]]. Departing there, she headed for her assigned patrol area off [[Port Said]]. On 20 October, two airplanes from [[Corfu]] forced Krsnjavi to make an emergency dive, but the U-boat escaped damage. On 25 October, ''U-40''  encountered a severe storm that damager one of her fuel tanks. Three days later, Krsnjavi ordered the boat back to port when the [[gyrocompass]] broke. The boat made Cattaro on 1 November and underwent repairs there over the five weeks.<ref name=Tengeral />

Departing from Cattaro on her third patrol on 10 December, Krsnjavi steered the boat to her patrol area: cruising the Mediterranean between [[Alexandria]] and Malta.<ref name=Tengeral /> The first day of the new year brought ''U-40''{{'}}s next success. On 1 January 1918, the {{GRT|5,134}} ''Sandon Hall'', a British steamer headed from [[Basra]] to London with a cargo [[linseed oil] and [[date (fruit)|date]]s, was sent to the bottom {{convert|22|nmi|km}} [[north-northeast]] of [[Linosa]].<ref name=sandon>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Sandon Hall | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/5422.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | date =  | accessdaymonth = 21 January | accessyear = 2009 }}</ref> A torpedo attack two days later on another steamer produced no result. Having exhausted her supply of torpedoes, ''U-40'' headed back to port. On 6 January, the U-boats deck gun was used to destroy a floating [[mine (naval)|mine]]. The following day the boat was fired upon by three [[drifter (fishing boat)|drifter]]s of the Otranto Barrage but safely returned to Cattaro on 8 January.<ref name=Tengeral />

After two month at Cattaro, Krsnjavi lead ''U-40'' out on her fourth patrol on 5 March. The U-boat came under attack on consecutive days while headed into the Mediterranean. On 9 March, two [[destroyer]]s forced her to [[crash dive]], while the following day a pair of airplanes did the same. Nine days later, ''U-40'' torpedoed the Canadian steamer ''Lord Ormonde'', but only damaged the 3,914-ton ship.<ref name=lord>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Lord Ormonde (d.) | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/3695.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | date =  | accessdaymonth = 21 January | accessyear = 2009 }}</ref> On 20 March, ''U-40'' sent the Greek cargo ship ''Antonios M. Theophilatos'' and her load of ammunition to the bottom.<ref name=Tengeral /><ref name=antonios group=Note>Uboat.net attributes the sinking of ''Antonios M. Theophilatos'' to the German U-boat {{SMS|U-33||2|sub=y}}, which was operating in the same area.

As Gibson and Prendergast note, ''U-40'' did not sink that day, discrediting the report.<ref name=Gib-268>Gibson and Prendergast, p. 268.</ref> ''U-40'' did depart from Cattaro for Pola at the end of May to undergo repairs for the next two months.<ref name=Tengeral />

''U-40'' departed from Pola on 5 August, but developed a leak a few days out and put in at Cattaro on 10 August. The U-boat returned to Pola about two weeks later and remained there until October.<ref name=Tengeral /> While at Pola, command of ''U-40'' passed to ''Linenschiffleutnant'' Wladimir Pfeifer on 19 September. The 27-year-old native of [[Leskovec]] (in present-day [[Slovenia]]), was previously in command of {{SMS|U-17|Austria-Hungary|2|sub=y}} and had, like Krsnjavi, also served a stint as commander of ''U-11''.<ref name=Pfeifer>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = WWI U-boat commanders: Wladimir Pfeifer | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/men/commanders/527.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | date =  | accessdaymonth = 20 January | accessyear = 2009 }}</ref>

On 19 October, ''U-40'' departed Pola and eventually arrived at [[Fiume]], where she remained through the end of the war.<ref name=Tengeral /> The U-boat was taken to [[Venice]] on 23 March 1919,<ref name=Tengeral /> where she was surrendered to the Italians as a [[war reparation]].<ref name=Con-344 /> She was scrapped at Venice the following year.<ref name=Con-344 /> In her 15-month service career, ''U-40'' sank three ships with a combined tonnage of 9,838, and damaged two others.
