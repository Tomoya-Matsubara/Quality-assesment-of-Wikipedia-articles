The naval '''Battle of Navarino''' was fought on [[20 October]] [[1827]], during the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821&ndash;29) in [[Pylos|Navarino Bay]], western Greece, on the [[Ionian Sea]]. A combined [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Egypt]]ian armada was destroyed by a combined [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]] and [[Russia]]n [[Navy|naval]] force, at the port of [[Pylos|Navarino]]. It is notable for being the final large-scale fleet action in history between sailing ships.

The Allied ships <!--- why say "even" Russian ships"? Russia had perfectly decent battleships by this time, many of 120 guns or more, equal to almost any other nation.--->were better armed than their Egyptian and Ottoman opponents and their crews were better trained, contributing to a quick victory.

==Background==
The various Greek forces had achieved significant results against the Ottoman fleet in 1821&ndash;24, but despite this an Ottoman-Egyptian army under the command of Egyptian [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] had reconquered Crete and part of the [[Morea]] by mid-1825.

Ibrahim was sent to [[Peloponnesos]] with a squadron and a [[Western world|Western]] trained army of 17,000 men in the service of Ottoman sultan [[Mahmud II]]. The expedition sailed on [[July 4]] [[1824]], but was for some months unable to do more than come and go between [[Rhodes]] and [[Crete]]. The fear of the Greek [[fireships]] stopped his way to the Morea. When the Greek sailors mutinied from want of pay, Ibrahim was able to land at [[Modon]] on [[February 26]] [[1825]]. He remained in the Morea until the capitulation of [[October 1]] [[1828]] was forced on him by the intervention of the [[Western powers]].

Ibrahim's operations in the Morea were energetic and ferocious. He easily defeated the Greeks in the open field, and though the siege of Messolonghi proved costly to his own troops and to the Ottoman forces who operated with him, he brought it to a successful termination on [[April 24]] [[1826]]. The Greek [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] bands harassed his army, and in revenge he desolated the country, burning crops,<!---"total war" means the gearing of the full economy to war production. "scorched earth" might be a better term, although that was usually done by the defenders.---> and sent thousands of the inhabitants into [[slavery]] in [[Egypt]].

The Ottoman fleet was then able to return and base itself at places like Navarino and Missolonghi to assist the land army. After several more skirmishes between Greece and the Ottoman Empire, other countries decided to step in to help the Greeks and to protect Allied shipping, which was being raided by Greek pirates. The [[Treaty of London, 1827|Treaty of London]] ([[6 July]] [[1827]]), a secret agreement between Britain, France and Russia to obtain autonomy for Greece, stipulated that if the treaty were rejected, the allied forces would sail against the Ottoman forces to enforce a peace. The Ottoman-Egyptian fleet, which had been warned by the British and French to stay away, left Alexandria on [[5 August]] [[1827]] and arrived at Navarino on [[8 September]]. Codrington arrived on [[12 September]] and instituted a blockade. The Ottomans made several attempts to leave the bay and sail north, but they were repelled each time by Codrington's presence and by adverse weather, and by the arrival of a French squadron under de Rigny on [[13 October]] which caused the Ottomans to return to port. A Russian squadron under [[Login Petrovich Geiden|Geiden]] arrived on the 13th also. More Allied ships were already at Navarino, and others arrived over the following week.

==The battle==
[[Image:Plan de la Bataille de Navarin.png|thumb|320px|right|Plan of the battle]]<!--this plan is rather innaccurate since it shows the ships all on the east side. better ones are available-->

On [[16 August]] Codrington, de Rigny and [[Login Petrovich Geiden|Geiden]] tried to arrange an armistice but the Turks declined the terms of the armistice. Showing defiance to the Allies, the Ottoman officers pretended not to know Ibrahim Pasha's whereabouts. The Greeks quickly agreed when it was shown to them on [[2 September]].

The Allied commanders decided to anchor their ships in Navarino Bay, amid the Ottoman-Egyptian fleet. The Allied fleet entered in two lines, one formed by the English and French ships, the other by the Russian ships. The Ottoman-Egyptian fleet was anchored in a [[horseshoe]] formation, and the Allied fleet anchored in the empty area in the centre of this horseshoe &mdash; the British facing the Ottoman-Egyptian battleships and frigates on the east, the French north of these, and the Russians on the western side. French frigates took up position south of the British battleships facing the Egyptian frigates since it was thought that the French sailors in the Egyptian fleet might hesitate to fire on their countrymen, and the smaller British ships dealt with the fireships and corvettes near the entrance. While the fleet was still anchoring, the captain of the British frigate ''Dartmouth'' sent a boat to an Ottoman ship anchored close by in order to demand that a fireship which was close to one of the British ships and appeared to be being set alight be removed. For reasons not quite clear, the Ottomans fired on the boat, killing the officer in command and several crew members. The frigate ''Dartmouth'' opened fire, then an Ottoman corvette in the 2nd line fired on the French flagship, ''Sir<U+00E8>ne'', and within a short time, the entire Allied fleet became engaged, as well as the Russian ships which were still entering the harbour. Heavier Allied broadsides and better gunnery quickly told, and in a few hours, three quarters of the Ottoman-Egyptian fleet was either sunk or set on fire by their own crews. On [[17 November]] it was reported that the Ottoman-Egyptian ships remaining afloat in Navarino Bay were 1 battleship and 4 frigates damaged, and 1 ras<U+00E9>e battleship, 2 frigates, 5 corvettes, 11 brigs and 5 schooners ready for sea, although this included some ships from Modon which had arrived after the battle (see [http://www.pbenyon.plus.com/Naval_History/Vol_VI/P_485.html this page] for figures). Allied casualties were about 181 men killed and about 480 men wounded; Ottoman and Egyptian casualties were given as 4109 (3000 killed and 1109 wounded, although those figures might be reversed).

After the battle the Allied fleet remained in Navarino Bay until [[26 October]]. Several Allied ships were badly damaged &mdash; ''Azov'' had been hit 153 times, 7 of them below the waterline, and was not fully repaired until March 1828. ''Gangut'' and ''Iezekiil'' were damaged too. The British arrived at Malta on [[3 November]], and the Russians on [[8 November]]. ''Albion'', ''Asia'' and ''Genoa'' were sent to England for repairs, while the French ships went to Toulon.

An Egyptian corvette left Navarino Bay on [[27 October]] and arrived in Alexandria on [[2 November]] with news of the battle. Other survivors made their way to Alexandria around the end of the year.

The most important result of this battle was that it crippled the Ottomans and Egyptians at sea. Their land forces in the Morea were unaffected, however. After tense negotiations the main Egyptian army returned to Egypt in September and October 1828, leaving the Ottomans no more than 1200 men in control of 5 forts. The French immediately sent troops in defiance of the agreement to remove these, and with the help of some British sailors, the Morea was cleared of Ottoman forces. The last holdout was [http://members.tripod.com/romeartlover/Rio.html Morea Castle], near [[Patrai]], which fell [[1 November]] [[1828]]. After this, Greece (consisting of the Morea and surrounding islands) was independent. The capital was [[Nauplion]]. In March 1829 this territory had been expanded through offensive action by Greek forces north to a line from the Gulf of [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] to the Gulf of [[Volos]].

The Tunisian ships were north of the main Ottoman line, near the small Khelon<U+00ED>si Island. The other ships were east of the main line.

'''Approximate total:''' 1 84-gun Ottoman battleship, 2 74-gun Ottoman battleships, 4 2-decker 64-gun Egyptian frigates, 2 2-decker Ottoman frigates, 3 48-gun Ottoman frigates, 8 or 10 42-gun Ottoman frigates, 2 or 3 48-gun Tunisian frigates, 8 Egyptian corvettes, 14-18 Ottoman 22-gun corvettes, 5 10-gun Ottoman brigs, 7 Egyptian brigs, 1 Tunisian brig, 5 (or 6?) fireships, perhaps 41 transports. Other ships in the harbour included 3 Tunisian, 3 Tripolitan and 4 Algerian warships and 5 European transports. The Ottomans and Egyptians used many hired European transports, mainly Austrian.

Note: It is hard to get an accurate list of Muslim ships for this battle. Some of the confusion stems from the smaller ships being counted as transports on leaving Alexandria and warships on their return. There is some uncertainty in the number of guns carried by several ships also.
