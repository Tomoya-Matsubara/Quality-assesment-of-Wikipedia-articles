'''Throwball''' is a non-contact ball sport played across a net between two teams of seven players on a rectangular court. Throwball is popular in Asia, moreover on the [[Indian subcontinent]] and was played as a women's sport in [[Chennai]] during the 1940s. The game's roots are closely linked with the [[YMCA]]. Rules were drafted in 1955 and India's first national level throwball championship was played in 1980.

==History==
Throwball is believed to have been taken from a recreational sport popular among women during the 1930s in [[England]] and [[Australia]]. The [[YMCA]] is believed to have brought throwball to India in the 1940s. The game first caught on in [[Chennai]] as a women's sport and in the 1950s became popular in [[Bangalore]]. HC Buck of the [[YMCA College of Physical Education]] in [[Chennai]] drafted guidelines for throwball rules and regulations in 1955.<ref name=TFIHist>{{cite web

==Rules and play==
The playing court is {{convert|12.20|x|18.30|m|ft|2}} with a neutral box {{convert|1.5|m|2}} on either side of the centre. The height of the net is {{convert|2.2|m|ft|2}}.

An official game is played between two teams of seven players. A maximum of five substitute players is allowed for each team, which can make a maximum of five substitutions during a set. A team can take two time-outs of 30 seconds each during a set. The first team to score 25 points wins a set. A match is three sets.

Service is within five seconds after the referee whistles and is done from the ''service zone'', without crossing the ''end line''. A player can jump while serving the ball. The ''service ball'' must not touch the net. Double touch is not allowed for receiving the service ball and players stay in 2-3-2 position during the serve. 

During a rally, the ball must be caught at once with both hands, without any sound or movement of the ball within the hands (''dubs'') and the player should have contact with the ground. Two players are not allowed to catch the ball simultaneously. The ball is thrown within three seconds after being caught, only from above the shoulder-line and only with one hand. A player can jump when throwing the ball, which can touch the net (but not the antenna). The player should have contact with the ground when catching the ball and can jump when throwing. However, the ball is not touched with any part of the body other than the palm when catching or throwing (''body touch''). The ball can neither be shifted (passed) to the left or right, nor deliberately pushed.

In official play, teams wear a shorts and jersey uniform with numbers only in the range of 1-12 printed front and  back.<ref>{{cite web
