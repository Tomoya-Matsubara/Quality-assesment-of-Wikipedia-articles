Of Hurston's four novels and more than 50 published short stories, plays, and essays, she is best known for her 1937 novel ''[[Their Eyes Were Watching God]]''.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Hurston was the fifth of eight children of John Hurston and Lucy Ann Hurston (n<U+00E9>e Potts). Her father was a [[Baptist]] [[preacher]], [[tenant farmer]], and [[Carpentry|carpenter]], and her mother was a school teacher. She was born in [[Notasulga, Alabama]], on January 7, 1891, where her father grew up and her grandfather was the preacher of a Baptist church.<ref>{{cite book |last=Boyd |first=Valerie |title=Wrapped in Rainbows: The Life of Zora Neale Hurston |year=2003 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |isbn=978-0-684-84230-1 |pages=14<U+2013>17, 439<U+2013>440 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Hurston |first=Lucy Anne |title=Speak, So You Can Speak Again: The Life of Zora Neale Hurston |year=2004 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |isbn=978-0-385-49375-8 |page=8 }}</ref> Her family moved to [[Eatonville, Florida]], one of the first all-[[African American|Black]] towns to be incorporated in the United States, when she was three.  Hurston said she always felt that Eatonville was "home" to her and sometimes claimed it as her birthplace<ref>Boyd, ''Rainbows'', p. 25.</ref>  Her father later became mayor of the town, which Hurston would glorify in her stories as a place where African Americans could live as they desired, independent of white society. In 1901, some northern schoolteachers visited Eatonville and gave Hurston a number of books that opened her mind to literature, and this may be why she sometimes describes her "birth" as taking place in that year.<ref>Sharon L. Jones, ''A Crticial Companion to Zora Neale Hurston: A Literary Reference to her Life and Work'' (New York:  Facts on File,  2009), pp. 3<U+2013>4</ref>  Hurston spent the remainder of her childhood in Eatonville, and describes the experience of growing up in Eatonville in her 1928 essay "How It Feels to Be Colored Me".

In 1904, Hurston's mother died and her father remarried, to Matte Moge, almost immediately, considered something of a minor scandal as it was rumored he had relations with Moge before Lucy died.<ref>Boyd, ''Rainbows'', p. 52.</ref> Hurston's father and new stepmother sent her away to a boarding school in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], but they eventually stopped paying her tuition and the school expelled her. She later worked as a maid to the lead singer in a traveling Gilbert & Sullivan theatrical company.<ref name="Zora Neale Hurston">[http://www.zoranealehurston.com/biography.html Zora Neale Hurston], Zora Neale Hurston official website, maintained by the Zora Neale Hurston Estate and Harper Collins.</ref> In 1917, Hurston began attending Morgan Academy, the high school division of the historically African American [[Morgan State University|Morgan College]] in [[Baltimore]], Maryland. It was at this time, and apparently to qualify for a free high-school education (as well, perhaps to reflect her literary birth), that the 26-year-old Hurston began claiming 1901 as her date of birth.<ref name="Zora Neale Hurston" /> She graduated from Morgan Academy in 1918.<ref>[http://www.lkwdpl.org/wihohio/hurs-zor.htm Zora Neale Hurston], Women in History.</ref>

===College===
In 1918, Hurston began undergraduate studies at [[Howard University]], where she became one of the earliest initiates of [[Zeta Phi Beta]] Sorority and co-founded ''[[The Hilltop (newspaper)|The Hilltop]]'', the University's student newspaper.<ref>Shivonne Foster, [http://media.www.thehilltoponline.com/media/storage/paper590/news/2007/11/20/Campus/Following.Footsteps.Zora.Neale.Hurston-3112139.shtml Following Footsteps: Zora Neale Hurston], ''[[The Hilltop (newspaper)|The Hilltop]]'', November 20, 2007.</ref> While there, she took courses in Spanish, English, Greek and public speaking and earned an Associate's Degree in 1920.<ref>Jones, ''Critical Companion'', p. 4.</ref>  In 1921, she wrote a short story, ''John Redding Goes to Sea'', which qualified her to become a member of [[Alain Locke|Alaine Locke's]] literary club, ''The Stylus''.  Hurston left Howard in 1924 and in 1925 was offered a scholarship to [[Barnard College]] where she was the college's sole black student.<ref name="oxfordreference.com">Cheryl A.

Oxford University Press.</ref> Hurston received her B.A. in [[anthropology]] in 1927, when she was 36. While she was at Barnard, she conducted [[ethnography|ethnographic]] research with noted anthropologist [[Franz Boas]] of [[Columbia University]]. She also worked with [[Ruth Benedict]] as well as fellow anthropology student [[Margaret Mead]].<ref>[http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/rothschild/cent_anth/early.html A Century of Barnard Anthropology, The Early Period]</ref> After graduating from Barnard, Hurston spent two years as a graduate student in anthropology at Columbia University.<ref name="Hurston, Zora Neale">Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online, [http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9041614 Hurston, Zora Neale], February 18, 2009.</ref>

===Adulthood===
In 1927, Hurston married [[Herbert Sheen]], a jazz musician and former classmate at Howard who would later become a physician, but the marriage ended in 1931.  In 1939, while Hurston was working for the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]], she married Albert Price, a 23-year-old fellow WPA employee, and 25 years her junior, but this marriage ended after only seven months.<ref name="oxfordreference.com" />

She lived in a cottage in [[Eau Gallie, Florida]], twice, once in 1929 and again in 1951.<ref name="ft110306">{{Cite news | first=Megan K. | last=Scott | title=Hurston's real home | url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20110309/LIFE/303090002/Zora-Neale-Hurston-s-real-home-Brevard-County| newspaper=[[Florida Today]] | location=Melbourne, Florida | pages= 1D | date=March 6, 2011  }}</ref>

During the 1930s, Hurston was a resident of [[Westfield, New Jersey]], where [[Langston Hughes]] was among her neighbors.<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-74410616.html Mule Bone: Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston's Dream Deferred of an African-American Theatre of the Black Word.], ''[[African American Review]]'', March 22, 2001. Accessed March 5, 2011. "In February 1930, Hurston headed north, settling in Westfield, New Jersey. Godmother Mason (Mrs. Rufus Osgood Mason, their white protector) had selected Westfield, safely removed from the distractions of New York City, as a suitable place for both Hurston and Hughes to work."</ref><ref>Horner, Shirley. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE5DE123CF935A25751C0A960948260 "About Books"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 16, 1986. Accessed March 5, 2011. "Dr. Lewis said that his research ''points out that, thanks to Mrs. Mason's generosity, Hughes lived in the early 1930s in a one-family house in Westfield, where his neighbor was another of Harlem's luminaries, Zora Neale Hurston.''"</ref>

In later life, in addition to continuing her literary career, Hurston served on the faculty of North Carolina College for Negroes (now [[North Carolina Central University]]) in Durham, North Carolina.<ref name="Hurston, Zora Neale"/>

She also established, in 1934, a school of dramatic arts "based on pure Negro expression" at [[Bethune-Cookman University]] (at the time, Bethune-Cookman College) in Daytona Beach, FL.<ref name="Porter">Porter ''Jump at de Sun: The Story of Zora Neale Hurston'' p. 66</ref>
In 1956 Hurston was bestowed the Bethune-Cookman College Award for Education and Human Relations in recognition of her vast achievements, and the English Department at Bethune-Cookman College remains dedicated to preserving her cultural legacy.<ref name="Chronology">zoranealehurston.com/chronology.html</ref>

===Anthropological and folkloric fieldwork===
 
Hurston traveled extensively in the Caribbean and the American South and immersed herself in local cultural practices to conduct her anthropological research. Her work in the South, sponsored from 1928 to 1932 by [[Charlotte Osgood Mason]],<ref>Boyd, ''Rainbows'', p. 157.</ref> a wealthy philanthropist, produced ''Mules and Men'' in 1935, often regarded as a folklore classic, as well as the base material for novels like ''Jonah's Gourd Vine'' published in 1934.<ref>Boyd, ''Rainbows'', pp. 246<U+2013>247.</ref>

In 1936 and 1937, she traveled to Jamaica and to Haiti with support from the [[Guggenheim Foundation]] from which her anthropological work ''Tell My Horse'' published in 1938 emerged.

She also lived in Honduras, at the north coastal town of [[Puerto Cort<U+00E9>s]] from October 1947 to February 1948.  Her trip to Central America was apparently occasioned by the idea of locating either Mayan ruins or vestiges of some other as yet undiscovered civilization.<ref>Boyd, ''Rainbows'', pp. 375<U+2013>87.</ref>  While in Puerto Cort<U+00E9>s, she wrote much of ''Seraph on the Suwanee'', a book which had nothing to do with Honduras.  Hurston expressed interest in the polyethnic nature of the population in the region (many of whom, such as the [[Miskito Sambu|Miskito Zambu]] and [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] were in fact of partial African ancestry).

===Later years===

In 1948, Hurston was falsely accused of molesting a ten-year-old boy, and although the case was dismissed after Hurston presented evidence that she was in Honduras when the crime supposedly occurred in the U.S., her personal life was seriously disrupted by the scandal.<ref name="oxfordreference.com" />

Hurston spent her last decade as a [[Freelancer|freelance]] writer for magazines and newspapers. Her autobiography reported that she worked in a library in [[Cape Canaveral, Florida]]; although new evidence indicates she worked at the Pan Am Technical Library at Patrick Air Force Base in 1957, just prior to moving to [[Fort Pierce, Florida|Fort Pierce]]. Here she took jobs where she could find them, including being a substitute teacher and a maid.

===Death===
During a period of financial and medical difficulties, Hurston was forced to enter St. Lucie County Welfare Home, where she suffered a stroke; she died of [[hypertensive heart disease]] on January 28, 1960, and was buried at the Garden of Heavenly Rest in Fort Pierce, Florida. Her remains were in an unmarked grave until 1973, when novelist [[Alice Walker]] and literary scholar [[Charlotte Hunt]] found an unmarked grave in the general area where Hurston had been buried, and decided to mark it as hers.

==Literary career==
===1920s===
When Hurston arrived in New York City in 1925, the [[Harlem Renaissance]] was at its peak, and she soon became one of the writers at its center. Shortly before she entered Barnard, Hurston's short story <U+201C>Spunk<U+201D> was selected for ''[[The New Negro]]'', a landmark anthology of fiction, poetry, and essays focusing on African and African American art and literature.<ref>Richard A. Long, "New Negro, The", ''The Concise Oxford Companion to African American Literature''. Ed. William L. Andrews, Frances Smith Foster, and Trudier Harris. Oxford University Press, 2001. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t52.e433]</ref> In 1926, a group of young black writers including Hurston, [[Langston Hughes]], and [[Wallace Thurman]], calling themselves the [[Niggerati]], produced a literary magazine called ''[[Fire!!]]'' that featured many of the young artists and writers of the [[Harlem Renaissance]].
In 1929, Hurston moved to Eau Gallie in Florida where she wrote, "Mules and Men" which was later published in 1935.<ref name="Indian River Journal ">{{cite book|title=Indian River Journal|series=Brevard Historical Commission |first=Ben |last=Brotemarkle |Fall/Winter 2011}}</ref>

===1930s===
By the mid-1930s, Hurston had published several short stories and the critically acclaimed ''Mules and Men'' (1935), a groundbreaking work of "literary anthropology" documenting African American [[folklore]]. In 1930, she also collaborated with Langston Hughes on ''[[Mule Bone|Mule Bone: A Comedy of Negro Life in Three Acts]]'', a play that was never finished, although it was published posthumously in 1991.
<ref name="Hurston, Zora Neale"/>

In 1937, Hurston was awarded a prestigious [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] to conduct ethnographic research in [[Jamaica]] and [[Haiti]]. ''Tell My Horse'' (1938) documents her account of her fieldwork studying African rituals in Jamaica and [[Haitian Vodou|voudon]] rituals in Haiti. Hurston also translated her anthropological work into the performing arts, and her folk revue, The Great Day premiered at the John Golden Theatre in New York in 1932.

Hurston's first three novels were also published in the 1930s: ''Jonah's Gourd Vine'' (1934); ''[[Their Eyes Were Watching God]]'' (1937), written during her fieldwork in Haiti and considered her masterwork; and ''[[Moses, Man of the Mountain]]'' (1939).

===1940s/1950s===
In the 1940s, Hurston's work was published in such periodicals as ''[[The American Mercury]]'' and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Her last published novel, ''[[Seraph on the Suwanee]]'', notable principally for its focus on white characters, was published in 1948.  It explores images of 'white trash' women. Jackson (2000) argues that Hurston's meditation on abjection, waste, and the construction of class and gender identities among poor whites reflects the [[eugenics]] discourses of the 1920s.<ref>Chuck Jackson, "Waste and Whiteness: Zora Neale Hurston and the Politics of Eugenics," ''African American Review'' 2000 34(4): 639<U+2013>660</ref>
 
In 1954, Hurston was assigned by the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]'' to cover the small-town murder trial of [[Ruby McCollum]], the prosperous black wife of the local [[bolita]] racketeer, who had killed a racist white doctor. She also contributed to ''Woman in the Suwannee County Jail'', a book by journalist and [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|civil rights]] advocate [[William Bradford Huie]]. In 2008, [[The Library of America]] selected excerpts from this work for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime writing.

===Public obscurity===
Hurston's work slid into obscurity for decades, for a number of cultural and political reasons.

Many readers objected to the representation of [[African American Vernacular English|African American dialect]] in Hurston's novels, given the racially charged history of [[Eye_dialect#Use|dialect fiction]] in American literature. Her stylistic choices in terms of dialogue were influenced by her academic experiences. Thinking like a folklorist, Hurston strove to represent speech patterns of the period which she documented through ethnographic research. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} For example, a character in ''Jonah's Gourd Vine'' expresses herself in this manner:

:''"Dat's a big ole resurrection lie, Ned. Uh slew-foot, drag-leg lie at dat, and Ah dare yuh tuh hit me too. You know Ahm uh fightin' dawg and mah hide is worth money. Hit me if you dare!  Ah'll wash yo' tub uh 'gator guts and dat quick."''

Several of Hurston's literary contemporaries criticized Hurston's use of dialect as a caricature of African American culture rooted in a racist tradition. More recently, many critics have praised Hurston's skillful use of idiomatic speech. In particular, a number of writers associated with the Harlem Renaissance were critical of Hurston's later writings, on the basis that they did not agree with or further the position of the overall movement. One particular criticism came from [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] in his review of ''Their Eyes Were Watching God'':

:... The sensory sweep of her novel carries no theme, no message, no thought. In the main, her novel is not addressed to the Negro, but to a white audience whose chauvinistic tastes she knows how to satisfy. She exploits that phase of Negro life which is "quaint," the phase which evokes a piteous smile on the lips of the "superior" race.<ref>[[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], "Between Laughter and Tears", ''[[The New Masses]]'', October 5, 1937.</ref>

During the 1930s and 1940s when her work was published, the pre-eminent African American author was Richard Wright.<ref>http://www.findingdulcinea.com/features/profiles/w/richard-wright.html</ref> Unlike Hurston, Wright wrote in explicitly political terms, as someone who had become disenchanted with communism, using the struggle of African Americans for respect and economic advancement as both the setting and the motivation for his work. Other popular African American authors of the time, such as [[Ralph Ellison]], dealt with the same concerns as Wright.
Hurston's work, which did not engage these political issues, did not fit in with this struggle.<ref>Ward, Jerry Washington Ward and Robert Butler, eds. "Zora Neale Hurston." ''The Richard Wright encyclopedia.'' Greenwood Press. 2008.</ref> In 1951, for example, Hurston argued that New Deal economic support created a harmful dependency by African Americans on the government, and that this dependency ceded too much power to politicians.<ref>Olasky, Marvin. "History turned right side up". ''WORLD magazine''. February 13, 2010. p. 22. http://www.worldmag.com/articles/16346</ref>

===Posthumous recognition===
An article, "In Search of Zora Neale Hurston", by [[Alice Walker]], published in the March 1975 issue of ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine, revived interest in Hurston's work. The reemergence of her work coincided with the emergence of authors such as [[Toni Morrison]], [[Maya Angelou]], and Walker herself, whose works are centered on African American experiences and include, but do not necessarily focus upon, racial struggle. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Biographies of Hurston include ''Zora Neale Hurston: A Literary Biography'' by [[Robert Hemenway]]; ''Wrapped in Rainbows'' by [[Valerie Boyd]]; ''Zora Neale Hurston: A Biography of the Spirit'' by [[Deborah G. Plant]]; "Zora Neale Hurston's Final Decade" by Virginia Lynn Moylan; and ''Speak So You Can Speak Again'' by Hurston's niece, [[Lucy Anne Hurston]]. Her hometown of [[Eatonville, Florida]], celebrates her life in an annual festival.

In 2001, "Every Tongue Got to Confess" was published posthumously. The book was a collection of field materials Hurston had gathered in the late 1920s to create her book "Mules and Men".  Originally titled [http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/19990522friday.html "Folktales from the Gulf States"], filmmaker Kristy Andersen had discovered the previously unknown collection of folk tales while researching the Smithsonian archives when they were placed in computer catalogs in 1997.

==Politics==
[[John McWhorter]] has called Hurston "America's favorite [[black conservative]]"<ref name=McWhoter>[[John McWhorter|McWhorter, John]], [http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_3_urb-zora-neale-hurston.html <U+201C>Thus Spake Zora"] City Journal, Summer 2009.</ref><ref name=Root>[[John McWhorter|McWhorter, John]] (2011-01-04) [http://www.theroot.com/views/why-zora-neale-hurston-was-conservative Why Zora Neale Hurston Was a Conservative], ''[[The Root (magazine)|The Root]]''</ref> while [[David T. Beito]] and [[Linda Royster Beito]] have argued that she can better be characterized as a "libertarian."  She was a Republican who was generally sympathetic to the foreign policy non-interventionism of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] and a fan of [[Booker T. Washington]]'s self-help politics. She disagreed with the philosophies (including Communism and the [[New Deal]]) supported by many of her colleagues in the Harlem Renaissance, such as [[Langston Hughes]], who was in the 1930s a supporter of the [[Soviet Union]] and praised it in several of his poems. Despite much common ground with the Old Right in domestic and foreign policy, Hurston was not a [[social conservative]]. Her writings show skepticism toward traditional religion and affinity for feminist individualism. In this respect, her views were similar to two [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] novelists who were her contemporaries: [[Rose Wilder Lane]] and [[Isabel Paterson]].<ref name=Beito>[[David T. Beito]] and Linda Royster Beito, [http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_12_04_4_beito.pdf <U+201C>Isabel Paterson, Rose Wilder Lane, and Zora Neale Hurston on War, Race, the State, and Liberty] Independent Review 12, Spring 2008).</ref>

In 1952, Hurston supported the presidential campaign of Senator [[Robert A. Taft]]. Like Taft, Hurston was against [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s New Deal policies. She also shared his opposition to Roosevelt and [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]]'s interventionist foreign policy. In the original draft of her autobiography, ''Dust Tracks on a Road'', Hurston compared the United States government to a "fence" in stolen goods and to a [[Mafia]]-like protection racket. Hurston thought it ironic that the same <U+201C>people who claim that it is a noble thing to die for freedom and democracy ... wax frothy if anyone points out the inconsistency of their morals. ... We, too, consider machine gun bullets good laxatives for heathens who get constipated with toxic ideas about a country of their own.<U+201D>  She was scathing about those who sought "freedoms" for those abroad, but denied it to people in their home countries:  Roosevelt "can call names across an ocean" for his [[Four Freedoms]], but he did not have <U+201C>the courage to speak even softly at home.<U+201D><ref name=Seeing>"Seeing the World As It Is," a chapter deleted at the insistence of the original publishers of Hurston's memoir ''Dust Tracks on a Road'', but later included in the Library of America edition edited by Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</ref>  When Truman [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped the atomic bombs on Japan]], she called him <U+201C>the Butcher of Asia.<U+201D><ref name=Beito/>

Hurston opposed the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling in the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' case of 1954. She felt that if separate schools were truly equal (and she believed that they were rapidly becoming so), educating black students in physical proximity to white students would not result in better education. In addition, she worried about the demise of black schools and black teachers as a way to pass on cultural tradition to future generations of African-Americans. She voiced this opposition in a letter, "Court Order Can't Make the Races Mix", that was published in the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' in August 1955. Hurston had not reversed her long-time opposition to segregation. Rather, she feared that the Court's ruling could become a precedent for an all-powerful federal government to undermine individual liberty on a broad range of issues in the future.<ref>Zora Neale Hurston, "Court Order Can't Make the Races Mix", ''Orlando Sentinel'', August 11, 1955.</ref><ref>[http://www.lewrockwell.com/epstein/epstein15.html  Reproduction of Hurston's Letter]</ref> Hurston also opposed preferential treatment for African-Americans, saying: 

<blockquote>
If I say a whole system must be upset for me to win, I am saying that I cannot sit in the game, and that safer rules must be made to give me a chance. I repudiate that. If others are in there, deal me a hand and let me see what I can make of it, even though I know some in there are dealing from the bottom and cheating like hell in other ways.<ref name=Root/>
