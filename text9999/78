'''William Alexander "Bill" Lange''' ({{pron-en|<U+02C8>l<U+00E6><U+014B>}})<ref name="dictionary">{{cite web| title = Lange entry from Dictionary.com | publisher = dictionary.com | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Lange | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}</ref> (June 6, 1871&nbsp;<U+2013> July 23, 1950), also known as "Little Eva",<ref name="robbins194">Robbins, p. 194</ref> was an American [[Major League Baseball]] [[center fielder]], who played his entire seven year career for the [[Chicago Cubs|Chicago Colts and Orphans]] from {{by|1893}} to {{by|1899}}.  During his time in the Majors, he once led the [[National League]] in [[stolen base]]s, and was among the seasonal leaders in several other offensive categories including [[home run]]s, and [[batting average]].

Lange was noted for having a combination of great speed and power, especially for his size. His {{convert|6|ft|1|in|m|adj=on}}, {{convert|190|lb|kg|adj=on}} frame was considered large for his era.<ref name="snyder101">Snyder, p. 101</ref>  He is best known for retiring from baseball during the prime of his career to get married, as his future father-in-law forbade his daughter to marry a baseball player.  Despite the short-lived marriage, he refused all offers to return as a player.

He became a successful [[Businessperson|businessman]] after his retirement from baseball.  In addition to his success in [[real estate]] and [[insurance]], he became a leading figure in Major League Baseball's efforts to generate interest in the game worldwide.  He was enlisted by the leading baseball figures of the day to assist in establishing leagues in several European countries, that could eventually compete against American teams, while also [[Scout (sport)|scouting]] for undiscovered talent.

==Early life==
Born in the [[Presidio of San Francisco|Presidio District]]<ref name="nelson51">Nelson, p. 51</ref> of [[San Francisco, California]],<ref name="retrosheet">{{cite web| title = Bill Lange's career stats | publisher = retrosheet.org | url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/L/Plangb102.htm | accessdate = 2008-07-28}}</ref>, he ran away from home while still in [[grammar school]] to live with his brother in [[Port Townsend, Washington]].<ref name=nelson51/>  It was from there that he moved up to play [[Minor League Baseball]] for the Seattle Reds of the Northwestern Baseball League in the early 1890s.<ref name="seattle">{{cite web|last=Raley|first=Dan|title = From Reds to Ruth to Rainiers: City's history has its hits, misses | publisher= ''[[Seattle Post]]''|date= 1999-07-04| url=http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/safeco/game/oldbp.shtml | accessdate = 2008-07-28}}</ref>  When the Northwestern League folded, Lange return the Bay area to play for the Oakland Colonels of the California League.<ref name="nelson52">Nelson, p. 52</ref>  He played one season for the Colonels, then was signed by the [[Chicago Cubs|Chicago Colts]] of the [[National League]].<ref name=nelson52/>

==Major League career==
Lange made his Major League debut on April 27, {{by|1893}} for the Colts, and enjoyed a successful inaugural Major League season.  He scored 92&nbsp;[[run scored|times]], hit eight [[home run]]s, had 88 [[run batted in|runs batted in]] (RBIs), while also finishing seventh in [[stolen base]]s with 47, and [[Batting average#Baseball|batted .281]].  This was the only time he batted under .300 during his Major League career.<ref name="reference">{{cite web| title = Bill Lange's career stats | work = [[baseball-reference.com]] | url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/l/langebi01.shtml | accessdate = 2008-08-05}}</ref>  In the field that season, he played at [[second baseman|second base]], in [[right fielder|right field]] and [[center field]].  He did not start playing center field exclusively until the following season.<ref name=retrosheet/>  Lange continued his success in {{by|1894}} by raising his batting average to .328 and finishing fifth in the league with 65&nbsp;stolen bases.<ref name=reference/>

Lange achieved his highest league rankings in {{by|1895}}. His .389&nbsp;batting average was fifth in the league<ref name=reference/> and is still the top individual season average in Chicago Cubs's history.<ref name="snyder86">Snyder, p. 86</ref>  He also finished second in the league in stolen bases with 67, fifth in home runs with 10, fifth in [[on-base percentage]] with .456, hit 16&nbsp;[[triple (baseball)|triples]], scored 120&nbsp;runs, and batted in 98&nbsp;RBIs.<ref name=reference/>

Lange had several notable moments during the {{by|1896}} season.  On July 4, he stole five bases in one game against the [[Louisville Colonels]]<ref name="snyder89">Snyder, p. 89</ref>, although it was two stolen bases short of the record of seven set by [[George Gore]] and [[Billy Hamilton (baseball)|Billy Hamilton]].<ref name="stolenbases">{{cite web| title = Stolen Bases Records | work = baseball-almanac.com | url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_stba.shtml | accessdate = 2008-08-19}}</ref>  During a game on August 31, he entered baseball lore with a feat that he never actually performed.  The game was scoreless in the bottom of the 10th [[innings|inning]] when Lange made a diving catch in center field to keep the game scoreless.  Later in the inning, Chicago's [[first baseman]], [[George Decker (baseball)|George Decker]] attempted to field a thrown ball from third baseman [[Barry McCormick]], but it bounced off and broke his wrist instead.  In an effort to get Decker to the [[hospital]] adjacent the [[Baseball park|ballpark]], his teammates knocked down several wooden slats of the outfield [[fence]] to expedite his journey.  However, the two events were confused and it became legend that Lange had crashed through the fence making that acrobatic catch in tenth.<ref name="snyder90">Snyder, p. 90</ref>  Lange finished the season with a .326&nbsp;batting average, while also stealing 84&nbsp;bases, second in the league, and finished eighth in league with 16&nbsp;triples.<ref name=reference/>

His success continued into the {{by|1897}} season, as he batted .340, scored 119&nbsp;runs, and led the league in stolen bases for the only time in his career.<ref name=reference/>  His production dropped his last two seasons in the Majors as his runs scored fell to 79 in {{by|1898}} and 81 in {{by|1899}}, although he still kept his batting averages of .319 and .325 respectively.<ref name=retrosheet/>

While he was very popular, his career as a baseball player was not without controversy.  He was ejected from a game on at least two occasions,<ref name=retrosheet/> one of which occurred on May 23, {{by|1897}} when he had an on-field fight with [[Washington Senators (1891-1899)|Washington Senators]] second baseman [[John O'Brien (second baseman)|John O'Brien]].<ref name="snyder91">Snyder, p. 91</ref>  On September 16, 1899, in a game against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Superbas]], [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] [[Ed Swartwood]] called the game because of darkness with Brooklyn up by two runs.  Lange, and other Chicago player surrounded Swartwood and proceeded to "knock him around", with Lange notably "tweaking" the umpire's ear.<ref name="seymour198">Snyder, p. 198</ref>

==Retirement==
Lange finished his career on October 15, 1899, having announced a few days earlier his intention to retire after the season. His team played a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] that day, winning 7&ndash;0 against the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Perfectos]], then losing to the Louisville Colonels later that day in a game shortened by darkness.<ref name=snyder101/>

He retired from the game at age 28, during the prime of his career, so he could marry a woman whose father forbade her to marry a baseball player.<ref name=snyder101/> In the eyes of the 19th century public, baseball players were popular, but were often looked upon as low class. Lange's future wife was from his hometown of San Francisco, and her family was very well-to-do. Also, with the prospect of entering into the world of real estate and insurance, he could make much more money than he did as a ball player.<ref name="nelson56">Nelson, p. 56</ref> Though the marriage ended in a divorce a short time later,<ref name=snyder101/> he would not take any offers to return to Major League Baseball, despite Chicago's salary offer of $3,500 that would have made him the highest paid player in the league.<ref name=nelson56/>  Although his career lasted only seven years, he finished as the decade leader among 1890s Chicago players in batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and stolen bases.<ref name="snyder64">Snyder, p. 64</ref>

==Post-career==
Lange became successful in both [[real estate]] and [[insurance]] in his hometown of San Francisco after he retired from baseball.<ref name="europe">{{cite web|title = Plan World-Wide League |publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]''|date=1919-01-19| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=950DE6D61339E13ABC4152DFB7668382609EDE | accessdate = 2008-07-28}}</ref>  Lange is also credited in several sources, as being the person who discovered future Chicago Cubs [[first baseman]], [[manager (baseball)|manager]], and [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]], [[Frank Chance]], after having watched him play for the local [[Fresno, California]] team during the off-season of 1897.<ref name="bioprojectchance">{{cite web| title = The Biography Project: Frank Chance | publisher= by Gregory Ryhal, bioproj.sabr.org | url=http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&pid=2327&bid=904 | accessdate = 2008-07-29}}</ref>  Lange had recommended Chance to the team owner, [[Jim Hart (baseball)|Jim Hart]], but Hart disputed this claim, saying that Henry Harris had recommended Chance to him while Harris was an owner of a San Francisco team in the fall of 1897.<ref name="simon91">Simon, p. 91</ref>

In {{by|1907}}, the California State League, a minor league, was declared by organized baseball to be an "outlaw" league.  Organized baseball accused the league of harboring players from the Majors Leagues who had violated the [[reserve clause]] to join a number of their teams.<ref name=seymour198/>  The league had become a rival to the already established [[Pacific Coast League]] (PCL), who, after being an "outlaw" league themselves, had signed the National Agreement with organized baseball, agreeing that they would not harbor blacklisted or banned players from the Major Leagues.<ref name=seymour198/> A national commission decided that the best way to deal with this situation was to dissolve this outlaw league.  They did this by lifting the blacklist on any player already in the State League, which would create competition among all known leagues, for these players.  This commission enlisted Lange, who used his influence with the sports editors in the local area to speed up the process.  The attempt worked as the PCL successfully lured the [[Sacramento, California]] team into joining their league, with many of the players soon to follow.<ref name=seymour198/>

Later, [[John McGraw]] of the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] enlisted Lange as his chief European baseball [[Scout (sport)|scout]], hoping to discover any hidden talent in that untapped market.  In {{by|1919}}, [[Ban Johnson]], the [[American League]] president enlisted Lange as his chief organizer of baseball teams in Europe, mainly in England, France, [[Belgium]], and Italy.<ref name=europe/>  Johnson's plan was for Lange to evaluate talent and establish an International Baseball League that could compete against the [[American League]] [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]] winning team in an effort to generate greater interest in the game.<ref name=europe/>  Lange became part of the board of directors at the [[YMCA]], which helped fund the expedition.  Additionally, [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]] owner [[Clark Griffith]] donated $40,000 worth of equipment to assist in supplying the new league.

Lange died at the age of 79 in his hometown of San Francisco, and is interred at the [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Colma|Holy Cross Cemetery]] in [[Colma, California]].<ref name=retrosheet/>  Two of his nephews played Major League ball as well, [[Ren Kelly|Ren]], and [[George Kelly (baseball)|George "Highpockets" Kelly]].<ref name=retrosheet/><ref name="praise">{{cite web| title = Bill Lange Praises Hoyt |publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]''|date=1921-10-13| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0CE5DB1431EF33A25750C1A9669D946095D6CF | accessdate = 2008-07-29}}</ref>  George later gained induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame in {{by|1973}}.<ref name="georgekelly">{{cite web| title = Highpockets Kelly's stats | publisher= retrosheet.org | url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/K/Pkellg101.htm | accessdate = 2008-07-29}}</ref>
