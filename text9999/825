Production of ''Skyfall'' was suspended throughout 2010 because of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer#Attempted sale and bankruptcy protection|MGM's financial troubles]]. They resumed pre-production following MGM's exit from bankruptcy on 21 December 2010, and in January 2011 the film was officially given a release date of 9 November 2012 by MGM and the Broccoli family, with production scheduled to start in late 2011.

=== Title ===
In August 2011, several news websites reposted a rumour that originally appeared in Serbian newspaper ''[[Blic]]'' stating that ''Bond 23'' would be entitled ''Carte Blanche'' and would be an adaptation of the [[Carte Blanche (novel)|recent continuation novel]] by [[Jeffery Deaver]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Serbian to play cello in Bond movie|url=http://english.blic.rs/Culture-Showbiz/7958/Serbian-to-play-cello-in-Bond-movie|publisher=Blic Online|accessdate=31 August 2011}}</ref> On 30 August, Eon Productions officially denied any link between ''Bond 23'' and ''Carte Blanche'', stating that "the new film is not going to be called ''Carte Blanche'' and will have nothing to do with the Jeffery Deaver book."<ref>{{cite web|title=Eon Productions officially deny bogus 'Carte Blanche' title rumours|url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/news/index.php?itemid=9658|publisher=MI6-HQ.com|accessdate=31 August 2011}}</ref>

On 3 October 2011, fifteen domain names including 'jamesbond-skyfall.com' and 'skyfallthefilm.com' were reported to have been registered on behalf of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony Pictures]] by internet brand-protection service [[MarkMonitor]]. This led to supposition in media that the film had been given the name "Skyfall". These reports were not confirmed at the time by Eon Productions, Sony or MGM.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Paul|title=007 now has a name!

''Skyfall'' was later confirmed as the title at the November press conference, during which co-producer [[Barbara Broccoli]] said that the title "has some emotional context which will be revealed in the film".<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a348799/james-bond-23-press-conference-daniel-craig-on-skyfall.html James Bond 23 press conference: Daniel Craig on 'Skyfall'] at DigitalSpy, retrieved 3 November 2011</ref>

=== Crew ===
''Skyfall'' is directed by [[Sam Mendes]], who first signed on to the project shortly after ''Quantum of Solace'' was released, and remained on-board as a "consultant" during the period of uncertainty surrounding MGM's financial situation.
