'''Wressle Castle''' is a [[Grade I listed]] [[quadrangular castle]] located in [[Wressle]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], [[England]].   The castle was built c.1380-1390 by [[Thomas Percy, 1st Earl of Worcester|Sir Thomas Percy]]. The castle was garrisoned by Parliament during the [[English Civil War]], and was largely demolished by an act of Parliament in 1650 as a precaution. A fire gutted the remaining south range of the castle in 1796, the only part still inhabited. Today, the form of a moat is visible as earthworks, and ruined buildings still remain; the castle is privately owned, and serves as farm buildings.
