'''State Route 369''' ('''SR&nbsp;369, OH&nbsp;369''') is a short, two-lane north&ndash;south [[state highway]] in the western portion of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]].  The southern terminus of SR&nbsp;369 is at an interchange with [[Ohio State Route 4|SR&nbsp;4]] approximately {{convert|2.50|mi|km}} northeast of [[Enon, Ohio|Enon]].  Its northern terminus is at [[U.S. Route 40 (Ohio)|U.S. Route 40]] (US&nbsp;40) nearly {{convert|1.50|mi|km}} east of [[Donnelsville, Ohio|Donnelsville]]. SR&nbsp;369 was created in the mid 1930s.  In addition to serving as a connector between SR&nbsp;4 and US&nbsp;40 southwest of [[Springfield, Ohio|Springfield]], it provides access to a county park named in honor of [[George Rogers Clark]].

==Route description==
All of SR&nbsp;369 is situated within [[Bethel Township, Clark County, Ohio|Bethel Township]] in the southwestern quadrant of [[Clark County, Ohio|Clark County]].  The route starts at an interchange with SR&nbsp;4 approximately {{convert|2.50|mi|km}} northeast of [[Enon, Ohio|Enon]].  SR&nbsp;369 serves as a continuation of Lower Valley Pike, which enters the interchange from the   North of SR&nbsp;4, the west side of SR&nbsp;369 abuts a residential subdivision, while the east side of the route straddles the western portion of the county&ndash;maintained George Rogers Clark Park.  As the highway proceeds north of the park boundary, both sides of the highway are lined with houses, leading up to the point where it comes to an end at US&nbsp;40 nearly {{convert|1.50|mi|km}} east of [[Donnelsville, Ohio|Donnelsville]].  Continuing to the north of the U.S. route following the terminus of SR&nbsp;369 is Tecumseh Road.<ref name="YahooMap">{{yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&lat=39.914055&lon=-83.922538&zoom=15&q1=39.907603%2C-83.90549&q2=39.921427%2C-83.913398 |title=Overview map of State Route 369 |accessdate=2009-01-15}}</ref>

SR&nbsp;369 is maintained by the [[Ohio Department of Transportation]] (ODOT).  As a part of its duties in maintaining this highway, ODOT tracks the volume of traffic using it by a metric called the [[average annual daily traffic]] (AADT).  This measurement determines the amount of traffic utilizing a particular stretch of the roadway on a typical day of the year.  A 2008 AADT report shows that the busiest stretch of SR&nbsp;369 is the portion in the vicinity of the SR&nbsp;4 interchange, at the Lower Valley Pike transition, where typically 2,900 passenger vehicles and 220 commercial vehicles use the highway on a daily basis.<ref name="ODOT_AADT">{{cite web|url=http://www.odotonline.org/techservapps/traffmonit/TMReports/TSR_Report/County_Reports/2008_Reports/cla08.pdf|title=Traffic Survey Report - Clark County|year=2008|publisher=Ohio Department of Transportation|page=5|accessdate=2011-03-12|format=PDF}}</ref>  The AADT along the portion of SR&nbsp;369 between SR&nbsp;4 and US&nbsp;40 was determined to be 1,580 passenger vehicles and 120 commercial vehicles.<ref name="ODOT_AADT"/> SR&nbsp;369 is not included within the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] (NHS).  The NHS is a system of routes that are deemed to be most important for the country's economy, mobility and defense.<ref name="NHS-SpringfieldOH">{{cite map | title=National Highway System: Springfield, Ohio | date=December 2003 | publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] | url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/nhs/maps/oh/springfield_oh.pdf | format=PDF|accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref>

==History==
The SR&nbsp;369 designation made its debut in 1934.  Originally, the route was a [[spur route]] off of US&nbsp;40 that served George Rogers Clark Park.<ref name=ODOT1933_map>{{cite map |title=Map of Ohio Showing State Highway System |url=http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/TransSysDev/Innovation/prod_services/Documents/StateMaps/otm1933a.sid |format=MrSID |publisher=Ohio Department of Highways |date=1933 |cartography=ODOH |accessdate=2009-01-15}}</ref><ref name=ODOT1934_map>{{cite map |title=Map of Ohio Showing State Highway System |url=http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/TransSysDev/Innovation/prod_services/Documents/StateMaps/otm1934a.sid |format=MrSID |publisher=Ohio Department of Highways |date=1934 |cartography=ODOH |accessdate=2009-01-15}}</ref>  In 1959, with the relocation of SR&nbsp;4 onto a new freeway alignment along the north side of the [[Mad River (Ohio)|Mad River]] through this vicinity, the southern terminus of SR&nbsp;369 was reconfigured such that the highway met the new freeway at an interchange at the south end of the park.<ref name=ODOT1958_map>{{cite map |title=Ohio Highway Map |url=http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/TransSysDev/Innovation/prod_services/Documents/StateMaps/otm1958a.sid |format=MrSID |publisher=Ohio Department of Highways |date=1958 |cartography=ODOH |accessdate=2009-01-15}}</ref><ref name=ODOT1959_map>{{cite map |title=Ohio Highway Map |url=http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/TransSysDev/Innovation/prod_services/Documents/StateMaps/otm1959a.sid |format=MrSID |publisher=Ohio Department of Highways |date=1959 |cartography=ODOH |accessdate=2009-01-15}}</ref>
