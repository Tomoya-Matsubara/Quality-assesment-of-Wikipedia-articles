'''''Erythrina crista-galli''''' is a flowering tree in the family [[Fabaceae]], native to [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Brazil]] and [[Paraguay]].  It is widely planted as a street or garden tree in other countries, most notably in [[California]] (in the [[United States]]).  It is known by several common names within South America: ''ceibo'', ''se<U+00ED>bo'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), ''corticeira'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) and the more ambiguous ''[[Erythrina|bucar<U+00E9>]]'', to name a few. In English it is often known as the '''Cockspur Coral Tree'''.

The tree's [[flower]] is the [[Floral emblem|national flower]] of [[Argentina]] (since 23 December 1942) and [[Uruguay]].

This species characteristically grows wild in [[gallery forest]] ecosystems along watercourses, as well as in [[swamp]]s and [[wetland]]s. In urban settings, it is often planted in parks for its bright red flowers.

==Description==
[[File:Erythrina crista-galli 2-3.jpg|thumb|left|A ''ceibo'' tree in an urban park in [[Rosario]], [[Argentina]].]]
''Erythrina crista-galli'' is a small [[tree]], the girth of its trunk measuring {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Normally it grows {{convert|5|-|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, although some individuals, such as in the Argentine provinces of [[Salta Province|Salta]], [[Jujuy Province|Jujuy]] and [[Tucum<U+00E1>n Province|Tucum<U+00E1>n]], can grow up to {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

The [[root]] is a [[taproot]] with [[root nodule|nodules]] produced by [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen fixing]] bacteria. The bacteria live in [[symbiosis]] with the tree, facilitating the tree's absorption of nitrogen in return for organic substances which the bacteria need. The tree's trunk is woody with irregular, spiny branches. These branches form a layer without definite form{{Verify source|date=January 2008}} and die after flowering. 

The tree flowers in the summer, from October to April in their native South America and from April to October in the northern hemisphere. It Usually blooms from November to February  The red [[flower]], arranged in [[inflorescence]]s of the [[raceme]] type, is pentameric, complete, and of bilateral symmetry.  Its [[sepal|calyx]] is gamosepalous, like a little red thimble. The corolla, like that of other [[legume]]s like [[Phaseolus vulgaris|common bean]]s, is butterfly-shaped; however, the largest petal, called the "standard", is arranged in the lower part. The two of the petals called "wings" are so small that they are practically hidden within the calyx. The remaining two petals partially fuse together on occasion and form the flower's keel or "carina"; this protects its reproductive organs. The [[androecium]] consists of ten [[stamen]]s, one free and nine united by their filaments (gynostemial androecium). The unicarpel gynoecium is welded between the stamens like a knife in its sheath. 

The flowers are rich in [[nectar]] and get visited by [[insect]]s, which usually have to crawl underneath the carina and thus [[pollination|pollinate]] the flowers.

They are also popular with many [[hummingbird]]s - in Brazil for example, the [[Glittering-bellied Emerald]] (''Chlorostilbon lucidus''), [[Gilded Hummingbird]] (''Hylocharis chrysura''), [[Black Jacobin]] (''Florisuga fusca''), [[White-throated Hummingbird]] (''Leucochloris albicollis'') and [[Planalto Hermit]] (''Phaethornis pretrei'') consider the Cockspur Coral Tree among their favorite foodplants.<ref>Baza Mendon<U+00E7>a & dos Anjos (2005)</ref> Several hummingbird species are able to drink the nectar without pollinating the flowers however.

This refers to the E. speciosa of Andrews, a different species

The tree's fruit is monocarpic and dry, of the [[legume]] type, and no more than a few centimeters in length. The chestnut-brown seeds are cylindrical in form and are arranged sparsely throughout the seedpod's interior. The seed germ contains hypogeous cotyledons - the seeds stay underground upon germination.
