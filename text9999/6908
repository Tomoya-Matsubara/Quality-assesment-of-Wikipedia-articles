"'''Katie and Emily'''" is the ninth and penultimate episode of the [[List of Skins episodes#Series 3|third series]] of the English [[teen drama]] ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]'', which first aired on 19 March 2009 on [[E4 (channel)|E4]] in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. The episode was written by Malcolm Campbell and [[Bryan Elsley]], and was directed by [[Charles Martin (director)|Charles Martin]]. The episode focuses on the characters of twins Katie and Emily Fitch ([[Megan Prescott|Megan]] and [[Kathryn Prescott]], respectively) as they prepare for their college's annual ball. Katie refuses to leave home, recovering from being hit in the head with a rock, and faces her weakening control over her sister. Emily, meanwhile, is heartbroken when her girlfriend, Naomi Campbell ([[Lily Loveless]]), turns down Emily's invitation to the ball, and [[coming out|comes out]] to her family about her sexuality.

"Katie and Emily" featured numerous [[cameo appearance]]s by the series' crew members and the winners of various ''Skins''-related competitions. While filming one of the episode's fight scenes, according to Kathryn Prescott, the actors "did it a bit too properly",<ref name=bts>{{cite video | title=Skins: The Complete Third Series <U+2013> "Making of episode 9" | medium=DVD | publisher = [[Channel 4|Channel 4 DVD]]}}</ref> with injuries sustained to both Megan Prescott and Giles Thomas. The episode drew just under one million viewers on its first broadcast and was E4's highest-rated programme of the week. It was received generally well by critics.

==Plot==
Emily, disguised as Katie, arrives at college to pretend that her twin sister is returning to school with nine stitches to the head after being hit with a rock by their friend Effy Stonem, who has disappeared. In actual fact, Katie is at home, miserable over the loss of her boyfriend Freddie Mclair ([[Luke Pasqualino]]), who only dated her to spite Effy, his real love interest. She begins to take notice of all the hints in front of her, and realises that Emily is gay. At college, Naomi uncovers Emily's disguise and tells her that she plans to spend the summer alone in [[Cyprus]]. When Emily tells Naomi that she will miss her, they kiss in an empty corridor and later find themselves at Naomi's house where they have sex. Afterward, Emily asks Naomi to the college ball, but Naomi, still crippled by insecurity over her sexuality, refuses, leaving Emily heartbroken. Emily leaves and at the bus stop meets Thomas Tomone ([[Merveille Lukeba]]), who offers her his shoes and jacket and is unconcerned when she tells him that she is gay. He tries to comfort her but admits that he believes it impossible to stop loving somebody, referring to his ex-girlfriend Pandora Moon ([[Lisa Backwell]]). Emily returns home and comes out to her family, telling them that she has been having sex with a girl named Naomi. Her father, Rob ([[John Bishop]]), dismisses it as a joke and her mother, Jenna ([[Ronni Ancona]]), is speechless, while Katie tries to deny it. She and Emily have a heated argument, leaving Katie crying.

The following morning, Naomi visits the Fitches' house, but Jenna answers the door. She confronts Naomi, convincing her that Emily is not gay and warning Naomi to stay away from her. Naomi too denies her own sexuality and leaves hastily. After waking up, Katie and Emily reconcile in their own secret language, and Emily reluctantly agrees to go to the ball with Katie. While shopping for ball gowns, they meet Pandora, who is returning a dress since Thomas has not forgiven her for her infidelity with their friend James Cook. The twins run into Freddie and JJ Jones ([[Ollie Barbieri]]) while trying on dresses. JJ reveals to Emily that he told Freddie that he had sex with her, and Freddie inadvertently tells Katie, who was unaware of this. She guilts Freddie into accompanying her to the ball and volunteers Emily to go with JJ. Later, she is furious with Emily for having sex with JJ without her permission, still insisting that Emily is "not gay, [just] stupid". Katie intercepts one of Naomi's phone calls to Emily and tricks Naomi into meeting with her, where she reveals Emily's affair with JJ and warns Naomi not to come to the ball.

As Katie, Emily, Freddie and JJ prepare to enter the ball, Naomi arrives, announcing that she knows about Emily and JJ's fling before she walks in. An upset Emily leaves, while Katie starts a fight with Naomi, where she reveals her deceit against her sister. After overhearing everything, Emily attacks Katie, wreaking havoc through the entire ball. Emily finally overpowers her sister and prepares to punch her, but reconsiders and instead helps Katie to stand up. In front of everybody, Emily tells Katie that she is her own person and that she is in love with Naomi. Katie accepts Emily's individuality and sexuality, and Naomi, no longer ashamed of their relationship, extends her hand to Emily. The couple leaves the ball hand-in-hand and Naomi tells Emily that she loves her too. Meanwhile, Pandora apologises again to Thomas and he forgives her, re-introducing himself.

"Katie and Emily" featured a number of [[cameo appearance]]s. Phil Goldie, who won the "''Skins'' Needs You" competition for young directors, appears as a man in the caf<U+00E9> where Naomi meets Katie.<ref name=extras>{{cite web| url = http://www.e4.com/skins/series3/online-extras-ep9.html| title = Online extras - episode 9| accessdate = 2009-07-09| publisher = [[E4 (channel)|E4.com]]}}</ref> Clara Nicholls and Antonio Khela, the winners of a competition to win a speaking role in ''Skins'', played the shop assistant and security guard respectively at the boutique where Katie and Emily shop for ball gowns, while another finalist from the competition, Allana Taylor, starred as a girl dancing with the students' Head of Form, Doug (Giles Thomas), at the ball.<ref name=extras/> One of the series' [[television crew#Runner|runners]], Laurence Wigfield, played a bystander at the ball and the crew's "[[wikt:jack of all trades|jack of all trades]]", Tyrone Hyman, appeared on a poster in Katie and Emily's bedroom.<ref name=extras/>

Lisa Backwell described the filming of the ball as her "most favourite, most mental day of filming".<ref name=Lisa>{{cite web| url = http://www.e4.com/blog/skins-news/post/2o1ol5asjpexxpxvxlevjm/view.e4| title = Lisa Backwell's second blog| accessdate = 2009-07-09| date = 19 March 2009| publisher = [[E4 (channel)|E4.com]]| author = [[Lisa Backwell|Backwell, Lisa]]}}</ref> At the end of the final take of Pandora's dancing with Doug, the students' head of year, the entire crew danced into shot.<ref name=Lisa/> Director [[Charles Martin]] was initially dubious of whether Megan and Kathryn Prescott would be able to film Katie and Emily's fight well enough, but Kathryn said that on their first rehearsal they "did it a bit too properly", ripping out parts of Megan's [[hair extensions]].<ref name=bts/> Emily's accidental punching of Doug during the fight was choreographed so that when Kathryn Prescott punched the air in front of Giles Thomas's face, the camera angle would make it appear that she was actually hitting him. While they were filming, however, Prescott genuinely punched Thomas by accident, causing him to stumble back and step on Megan Prescott's bare foot, which she injured.<ref name=bts/>

Sarah Warn, editor-in chief of lesbian-based website [[AfterEllen.com]], thought that the portrayal of Emily and Naomi's relationship in the episode was "a good example of a well-plotted, well-executed, and well-acted storyline coming to a satisfying conclusion", which she regarded as "a noteworthy event given how few TV shows you can say that about". She felt that Emily's changing relationship with Katie as a significant part of her character development made her "sympathetic and relatable to those who might have otherwise have difficulty relating to a lesbian character".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.afterellen.com/TV/2009/1/skins-finale| title = "Skins" Gives Emily and Naomi (and Viewers) a Happy Ending| accessdate = 2009-07-09| date = 23 March 2009| publisher = [[AfterEllen.com]]| author = Warn, Sarah}}</ref> One critic for [[PopSugar|PopSugar.com]] wrote that in this episode the "drama was still in full flow" despite the absence of principal characters Effy and Cook, and was impressed with the episode's "uplifting ending".
