'''Nicholas Anthony "Nick" Robinson''' (born 5 October 1963) is a British [[journalist]] and [[political editor]] for the [[BBC]].<ref name=saturdayprofile>{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/the-saturday-profile-nick-robinson-news-hound-460173.html | title=The Saturday Profile: Nick Robinson, news hound |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Independent Print Limited | first=Sophie |last=Morris | accessdate=24 April 2010 | location=London | date=4 August 2007}}</ref> Robinson was interested in politics from a young age, and went on to study a [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics]] degree at Oxford University, where he was also President of the [[Oxford University Conservative Association]]. Starting out in broadcasting at [[Piccadilly Radio]], he worked his way up as a producer eventually becoming deputy editor of [[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]], the world's longest-running current affairs programme, before becoming a political correspondent in 1996. He became the BBC's chief political correspondent in 1999, and between 2002 and 2005 he worked for [[ITV News]] as political editor, but then returned to the BBC assuming the same role, which he has held since.

Noted for his confrontational and provocative approach, Robinson has on several occasions caused a stir with his style of questioning, particularly of world leaders such as [[George W. Bush]]. His history of Conservative affiliation has been controversial, particularly when allegations of bias were made during his coverage of the [[2010 United Kingdom general election]]. He has presented a variety of programmes, including ''[[Westminster Live]]'', ''Weekend Breakfast'' and ''Late Night Live'' on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], and ''[[Newsnight]]''. 

==Early life==
Born in [[Macclesfield]], [[Cheshire]], in 1963, Robinson was interested in political journalism from the age of eight.<ref name="indy">{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/nick-robinson-northern-arsey-confrontational-416446.html |work=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print Limited |title=Nick Robinson: Northern, arsey, confrontational | date=19 September 2006 | last=McSmith |first=Andy|accessdate=24 April 2010 | location=London}}</ref> He attended the independent [[Cheadle Hulme School]] before reading [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics]] at [[University College, Oxford]].<ref name=saturdayprofile /> At university he was President of the [[Oxford University Conservative Association]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordconservatives.com/associations/ouca.php |title=Oxford University Conservative Association |work=[[Oxford University Conservative Association]] |publisher=[[Oxford Conservative Association]] |accessdate=24 April 2010}}</ref>

In 1982, while travelling in Europe, he survived a car crash in [[Lille]], [[France]], in which the car, a two-door [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]], exploded and his friends James Nelson and Will Redhead (son of [[Brian Redhead]], a journalist and co-presenter of ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' on [[BBC Radio 4]]) were killed.<ref name=mirror>{{cite news |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BBC%27s+new+hardman..+haunted+by+teenage+tragedy%3B+NICK+ROBINSON...-a0135829282 |title=BBC's new hardman haunted by teenage tragedy |first=Fiona |last=Cummins |date=6 September 2005 |work=[[The Daily Mirror]] |publisher=The Free Library |accessdate=14 August 2010}}</ref> Robinson was "severely burned",<ref name="indy" /> spent five weeks in hospital and had to defer his university place.<ref name=mirror /> Brian Redhead became Robinson's mentor, and later encouraged his career in political journalism, giving him a copy of [[Tony Benn]]'s ''Arguments for Socialism'' for his birthday. However, his early political affiliations were to the right.<ref name="indy" /> In 1986, Robinson spent a year as national chairman of the [[Young Conservatives (UK)|Young Conservatives]],<ref name="indy" /> and earned the nickname "Blue Robbo", in reference to [[Derek Robinson (spokesman)|Derek Robinson]], a [[trade union]] spokesman who was known as "Red Robbo".<ref name=saturdayprofile />

==Career==

=== Early career: 1986<U+2013>1996 ===
Robinson's first position in broadcasting was at [[Piccadilly Radio]] in Manchester, which he took up while recovering from his injuries.<ref name=mirror /> He joined the BBC in 1986 as a production trainee, and later worked extensively as a [[television producer|television]] and [[radio producer]] for a variety of shows including ''[[Newsround]]'' and ''[[Crimewatch]]''. He then became an assistant producer for ''[[On The Record (BBC TV series)|On the Record]]'', and in 1993 was promoted to deputy editor on ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'', the world's longest-running current affairs programme, a position he held for three years.<ref name=saturdayprofile /> In 1995, while Robinson was at ''Panorama'' he wrote an internal BBC memorandum questioning how an interview with Prime Minister [[John Major]] could be defended in the run-up to the Scottish local elections. When leaked it gained attention from the Labour Party, who perceived it as the legitimised denial of equal time in the run up to local elections.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/labour-says-other-leaders-should-join-major-interview-1613487.html |first=Patricia |last=Wynn Davies |title=Labour says other leaders should join Major interview |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Independent Print Limited |date=31 March 1995 |accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref>

In 1996 he became a political correspondent, presenting ''Weekend Breakfast'' and ''Late Night Live'' on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], and in 1997 he covered the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|general election]] for BBC Radio. In October 1999 he became [[BBC News 24]]'s chief political correspondent, and also presented ''[[Westminster Live]]''. In the run-up to the 2001 general election, Robinson started keeping a daily diary of the campaign. Entitled "The Campaign Today", it later became Newslog,<ref name=saturdayprofile /> and continued to be updated until Robinson left the BBC. When he returned in 2005 he began a new blog with the same name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/2005/11/about_nick_robi.html |title=About Nick Robinson |date=29 November 2005 |work=BBC Blogs |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref>

=== ITN political editor: 2002<U+2013>2005 ===
In 2002, Robinson left the BBC for [[Independent Television News]] (ITN) as ITV News' [[political editor]]. [[Tom Bradby]], who later succeeded him, described the appointment as "bold, imaginative and instantly successful".<ref name=saturdayprofile /> Robinson stayed with ITN for three years, and caused a major stir early in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 election]] campaign at the unveiling of a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] poster. The poster claimed the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] would initiate cuts of [[GBP|<U+00A3>]]35 billion to public services if elected; Robinson challenged [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]], claiming the poster was misleading,<ref name=davidrowan /> which forced Blair to admit the <U+00A3>35 billion figure was "disingenuous".<ref name=saturdayprofile /> Later on in the election campaign, Labour announced that Tony Blair would be making "the most important speech of the campaign" on immigration, with a specially invited audience. Robinson asked Blair why there were only white people in the audience, and Blair pointed out a single Asian man to disprove Robinson. Later, Robinson stated "We know that the big two parties carefully select audiences to give a particular appearance. Is it a great controversy to point this out? That's informing the audience." On election night, Robinson joined presenters [[Jonathan Dimbleby]] and [[Alastair Stewart]] to reveal the results with political analysis.<ref name=davidrowan />

===Return to the BBC: 2005<U+2013>present===
Robinson left ITN and was appointed as the BBC political editor in preference to fellow journalist [[Martha Kearney]] in August 2005, replacing [[Andrew Marr]].<ref name=saturdayprofile /> Robinson continued his provocative approach to journalism, and on more than one occasion had run-ins with powerful politicians. During Tony Blair's visit to Israel in 2006 to discuss the [[Lebanon]] war, journalists were asked not to bring up the ongoing rift with Gordon Brown. Tom Bradby, the ITV political editor, asked a question on the subject but was told it was "disrespectful". Robinson then followed on the same topic, asking a difficult question on the feud between the Chancellor and Prime Minister. He was criticised for distracting from the main issue of the conference, but he argued that "I'm paid to ask questions... particularly at a time when there are incredibly serious allegations... I react very badly to organised attempts to stop journalists asking questions." Robinson later criticised Blair's announcement of his intention to stand down. He explained how he considered the setup "stage management", and how no journalists were allowed to ask questions.<ref name="indy" /> In December 2006 he got a very hard stare from [[George W. Bush]] when he asked him if he was in denial about the situation in Iraq (since the most Bush had said about the situation was that the increase in attacks was "unsettling"). Bush replied coldly "It's bad in Iraq. Does that help?".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/men/article2180853.ece | work=[[Times Online]] |publisher=[[News Corporation]] | title=Nick Robinson: Leader of the awkward squad |date=2 August 2007 | accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref> He had another run in with Bush at a press conference at [[Camp David]], when Bush asked him "you still hanging around?". He then suggested to Robinson, with reference to the heat, that "next time you should cover your bald head". As Bush walked away Robinson replied "I didn't know you cared", to which Bush responded "I don't". Robinson described his quip as a "fatal error" on his blog.<ref name=saturdayprofile /> In a final encounter in 2008, Bush joked with Robinson about still not wearing his hat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/andrewporter/4041751/George_Bush_and_Nick_Robinson_the_real_special_relationship |title=George Bush and Nick Robinson: the real special relationship |first=Andrew |last=Porter |date=18 April 2008 |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref>

Robinson continues to keep a [[blog]] on the BBC website, which discusses politics. His posts have occasionally caused controversy: on 5 May 2006 he raised eyebrows with the revelation that when hearing of [[Charles Clarke]]'s sacking in the 2006 Cabinet reshuffle, he was "naked in bed."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/2006/05/in_and_out_1.html | publisher=BBC | title=In and out |first=Nick |last=Robinson |date=5 May 2006 |accessdate=14 August 2010}}</ref> He later apologised, saying he was "merely trying to add authenticity. That's the naked truth."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/2006/05/naked_truth.html | title=Naked truth |first=Nick |last=Robinson |publisher=BBC |date=6 May 2006 |accessdate=14 August 2010}}</ref> This incident briefly earnt him the nickname "Naked Nick".<ref name=saturdayprofile /> Another post dated 25 February 2008 criticised MPs defending [[Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn|Michael Martin]] against allegations of expenses misuse,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/2008/02/theories_on_the.html |title=Theories on the Speaker |first=Nick |last=Robinson |date=25 February 2008 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=14 August 2010}}</ref> which caused controversy in parliament.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/news/a90270/mps-attack-robinson-blog-on-speaker-row.html |title=MPs attack Robinson blog on Speaker row |first=Dave |last=West |date=26 February 2008 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=Digital Spy Limited |accessdate=14 August 2010}}</ref>

Outside of his work as political editor, Robinson has also worked on politics-related programmes, such as ''[[The Daily Politics]]'', ''[[Newsnight]]'' and ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' on [[BBC Radio 4]]. He joined [[David Dimbleby]], [[Jeremy Paxman]], [[Jeremy Vine]] and [[Emily Maitlis]] to report and provide analysis on the [[2010 United Kingdom general election]] night.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8662141.stm | title=BBC election coverage: Log on and tune in |publisher=BBC |date=6 May 2010 | accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref> He has also appeared as guests in other television programmes, including ''[[Children in Need]]'', ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'',<ref name=saturdayprofile /> and ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/253723/reasonablypriced_kia_is_new_top_gear_star.html |title=Reasonably-priced Kia is new Top Gear star |date=28 June 2010 |work=[[Auto Express]] |publisher=Dennis Publishing Limited |accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref>

===Criticism===
Robinson has been criticised for allegedly reporting with a pro-[[Tory]] bias, and [[Alastair Campbell]] brought up his history of conservative affiliations when confronted with a difficult question.<ref name=davidrowan /> Bias was claimed particularly in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election]] coverage; a [[Facebook]] group entitled "Nick Robinson should not be the BBC's political editor" was set up and as of August 2010 has over 2000 members.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2010/may/14/nickrobinson-bbc |title=Facebook campaign urges BBC to fire Nick Robinson for pro-Tory bias |first=Roy |last=Greenslade |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |date=14 May 2010 |accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref> In a 2005 interview with David Rowan, the UK editor of [[Wired News]], he insisted "that his involvement [with the Conservatives] ceased 20 years ago".<ref name=davidrowan>{{cite web | url=http://www.davidrowan.com/2005/05/interview-nick-robinson-itv-news.html |title=Interview: Nick Robinson |first=David |last=Rowan |publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]] |work=Evening Standard |date=4 May 2005 |accessdate=24 April 2010}}</ref>

He has also reported receiving [[hate mail]] about his distinctive [[Gucci]] glasses, including one advising him to "go to [[Specsavers]]". Advised by a fashion expert to get a distinctive pair, "or risk fading into the background",<ref name=mirror /> they have become his trademark, along with his bald head and provocative approach to journalism and politics. When he joined BBC News in 1999, he was almost made to wear [[contact lenses]] instead but he refused,<ref name=indy /> stating they were "like large pieces of grit in [his] eye".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2010/apr/11/nick-robinson-agenda-upcoming-election |title=Nick Robinson on the election |first=Elizabeth |last=Day |work=[[The Observer]] |publisher=Guardian Media Group |date=11 April 2010 |accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Robinson met his wife Pippa, a relationship counsellor, at university and they married in 1991. He has three children: Alice, Will (named in memory of Will Redhead) and Harry.<ref name=mirror /> He lives in North London, close to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s [[Emirates Stadium]]. He is a lifelong [[Manchester United F.C|Manchester United]] fan, and enjoys sailing and the theatre.<ref name=saturdayprofile />
