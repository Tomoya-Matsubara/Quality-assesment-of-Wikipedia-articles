== Swimming career ==

Wagner won the gold medal in the 200-meter individual medley and the silver medal in the 400-meter individual medley at the [[1993 FINA Short Course World Championships]] in [[Palma de Mallorca, Spain]].  Her winning time in the 200-meter medley (2:07.79) stood as the world record in the event for over fourteen years until Zimbabwe's [[Kirsty Coventry]] broke it at the World Short Course Championships in April 2008 in [[Manchester, England]], when Coventry clocked 2:06.13.

''[[Swimming World magazine|Swimming World]]'' magazine named Wagner as its [[Swimming World Swimmers of the Year|American Swimmer of the Year]] in January 1994&mdash;when she was only 16 years old.<ref>"[http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/SwimmersOfTheYear.asp  ''Swimming World's'' American Swimmers of the Year]," ''Swimming World'' (undated).  Retrieved July 29, 2011.</ref>  At the 1994 U.S. long-course championships held in August 1994, she won the national titles in the 200-meter and 400-meter individual medley events, as well as the 200-meter breaststroke.<ref>Associated Press, "[http://articles.latimes.com/1994-08-19/sports/sp-29000_1_world-record-holders  Swimming: It's Business as Usual for Evans and Jager]," ''Los Angeles Times'' (August 19, 1994).  Retrieved July 30, 2011.</ref>

Wagner graduated early from high school to accept an athletic scholarship to attend the [[University of Florida]] in Gainesville,<ref name=pleasants2101997/> where she swam for coach Chris Martin and coach Kevin Thornton's [[Florida Gators swimming and diving]] teams in [[National Collegiate Athletics Association]] (NCAA) competition from 1995 to 1998.<ref name=ufmediasupp>''[http://web.gatorzone.com/swimmingdiving/media/2011/supplement.pdf  Florida Swimming & Diving 2011&ndash;12 Media Supplement]'', University Athletic Association, Gainesville, Florida, pp. 61, 62, 67, 69, 75&ndash;76, 79 (2011).  Retrieved April 10, 2012.</ref>  As a Gator swimmer, she won seven [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) titles and the 1995 NCAA title in the 400-yard individual medley.<ref name=ufmediasupp/>  Wagner was named the SEC Female Swimmer of the Year in 1995 and 1996 and the Gators' Most Valuable Swimmer in 1996, and received eleven [[All-American]] honors.<ref name=ufmediasupp/>

At the [[Swimming at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], Wagner won the silver medal in the [[Swimming at the 1996 Summer Olympics <U+2013> Women's 400 metre individual medley|400-meter individual medley]], finishing second behind Ireland's [[Michelle Smith]].<ref name=sroprofile>Sports-Reference.com, Olympic Sports, Athletes, [http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/wa/allison-wagner-1.html  Allison Wagner].  Retrieved July 29, 2011.</ref>  Four days later, she swam in the [[Swimming at the 1996 Summer Olympics <U+2013> Women's 200 metre individual medley|200-meter individual medley]] and finished sixth.<ref name=sroprofile/>

On several occasions during Wagner's career, she was beaten in major championships by swimmers who were highly suspected or later proven to be users of banned performance-enhancing substances.  Besides Michelle Smith in the 1996 Olympics, Wagner finished second behind China's Dai Guohong in the 1993 Short Course World Championships (200-meter individual medley) and China's [[L<U+00FC> Bin (swimmer)|L<U+00FC> Bin]] at the 1994 Worlds (both 200-meter and 400-meter individual medley).  Dai never failed a drug test, but Lu tested positive a few weeks after beating Wagner.  Nevertheless, Lu was allowed to keep her 200-meter individual medley gold medal.

Wagner retired from competition swimming in 2000, but attempted a comeback in 2006&ndash;07.<ref>Karen Crouse, "[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/sports/othersports/01swim.html  Near 30, Swimmer Resumes Sport for the Young]," ''The New York Times'' (July 1, 2011).  Retrieved July 30, 2011.</ref>
