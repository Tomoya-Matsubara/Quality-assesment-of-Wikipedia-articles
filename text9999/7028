'''Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia''' ('''CPVT''') is a rhythm disorder of the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]] of the [[heart]] that occurs in [[genetic predisposition|genetically predisposed]] individuals. Synonyms: Familial Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (FPVT), Catecholamine-Induced Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia. Thought to affect as many as one in ten thousand people, it is estimated to cause 15% of all unexplained [[sudden cardiac death]]s in young people.

First recognized in 1975, this condition is due to [[mutation|mutations]] in [[gene|genes]]<U+00A0>encoding a [[voltage gated calcium channel]] or proteins related to this channel. All mutated proteins participate in the regulation of calcium ion flow in and out of the [[sarcoplasmatic reticulum]]<U+00A0>of cardiac cells. Therefore reduced electrical stability of cardiomyocytes may cause the heart to enter a [[medical emergency|life-threatening]] state of [[ventricular arrhythmia]] as response to the natural release of [[catecholamines]] from nerve endings on the heart muscle and from the [[adrenal glands]] into the circulation. This rhythm disturbance prevents the heart from pumping blood appropriately. Ventricular tachycardia may self-terminate or degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, causing sudden death unless immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation is applied. 

==Signs and symptoms==
The most common symptom is dizziness or [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] which often occurs during exercise or as a response to emotional stress. 

===Age at onset===
CPVT typically start manifesting during the first or second decade of life. The majority of events occur during childhood with more than 60% of affected individuals having their first episode of syncope or cardiac arrest by age 20.

===Triggers===
Symptoms are typically precipitated ("triggered") by exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias during periods of physical activity or acute emotional stress. 

==Diagnosis==
Affected patients demonstrate no structural problems of the heart upon echocardiographic, CT or MRI imaging. 

CPVT diagnosis is based on reproducing irregularly shaped [[polymorphic ventricular tachycardia|ventricular arrhythmias]]  during [[cardiac stress test|ECG exercise stress testing]], syncope occurring during physical activity and acute emotion, and a history of exercise or emotion-related palpitations and dizziness with an absence of structural cardiac abnormalities.<ref name='IRCCS'>{{cite journal|title=Diagnosis and treatment of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia|journal=Heart Rhythm|date=May 2007|first=Carlo|last=Napolitano|author2=Silvia G.

==Molecular Genetics==
CPVT can be caused by mutations in either one of at least five genes, four of which are currently known. Mutations in two genes cause CPVT inherited by an [[autosomal dominant]] (AD) inheritance pattern while the other ones follow [[autosomal recessive]] (AR) inheritance

RYR2 mutations have been well characterized and been found to occur primarily in 4 major domains.<ref name="Priori 2011 871<U+2013>883"/> Mutations in domains III and IV of the protein (amino acid range from 3778 to 4201 and 4497 to 4959 respectively) occur in 46% of reported mutations.<ref name="Priori 2011 871<U+2013>883"/> Mutations occur less frequently in domains I and II (amino acid 77-466 and 2246-2534 respectively).<ref name="Priori 2011 871<U+2013>883"/> Causative RYR2 mutations outside these four domains are very rare, occurring in as little as 10% of reported cases.<ref name="Medeiros-Domingo 2009 2065<U+2013>2074">{{cite journal|last=Medeiros-Domingo|first=A|author2=Bhuiyan ZA|author3=Tester DJ|author4=Hofman N|author5=Bikker H|author6=van Tintelen JP|author7=Mannens MM|author8=Wilde AA|author9=Ackerman MJ|displayauthors=9|title=The RYR2-encoded ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel in patients diagnosed previously with either catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or genotype negative, exercise-induced long QT syndrome: a comprehensive open reading frame mutational analysis|journal=J Am Coll Cardiol |year=2009|volume=54|pages=2065<U+2013>2074}}</ref> Ryr2 mutations are most often single nucleotide substitutions resulting in a different amino acid substitution, however some in-frame substitutions and duplications have been documented <ref name="Medeiros-Domingo 2009 2065<U+2013>2074"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Tester|first=DJ|coauthors=, Kopplin LJ, Will ML, Ackerman MJ|title=Spectrum and prevalence of cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) mutations in a cohort of unrelated patients referred explicitly for long QT syndrome genetic testing|journal=Heart Rhythm|year=2005|volume=2|issue=1099-1105}}</ref>
. It is commonly accepted that more severe mutations have not been linked to CPTV as they are more likely to underlie different cardiac pathologies.<ref name="Priori 2011 871<U+2013>883"/> 
  
Recent findings have characterized the pathology of RYR2 mutations and how they relate to SOICR as a matter of the intrinsic properties of the ryanodine channel. Two theories propose the underlying mechanism, domain unzipping and FKBP12.6 unbinding.<ref name="Priori 2011 871<U+2013>883"/> Firstly, domain unzipping refers to the separation of the N-terminal domain's interaction with the central domain; destabilizing the receptor.<ref name="Ikemoto 2000 310<U+2013>316">{{cite journal|last=Ikemoto|first=N|author2=Yamamoto T |title=Postulated role of inter-domain interaction within the ryanodine receptor in Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel regulation|journal=Trends Cardiovasc Med |year=2000|volume=10|pages=310<U+2013>316}}</ref><ref name="Tateishi 2009 536<U+2013>545">{{cite journal|last=Tateishi|first=H|coauthors=Yano M, Mochizuki M, Suetomi T, Ono M, Xu X, Uchinoumi H, Okuda S, Oda T, Kobayashi S, Yamamoto T, Ikeda Y, Ohkusa T, Ikemoto N, Matsuzaki M|title=Defective domain-domain interactions within the ryanodine receptor as a critical cause of diastolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak in failing hearts |journal=Cardiovasc Res |year=2009|volume=81|pages=536<U+2013>545}}</ref> The mutation would compromise the stability of the Ryr2's closed state and increase its sensitivity to stimuli like luminal and cytosolic calcium.<ref name="Priori 2011 871<U+2013>883"/><ref name="Ikemoto 2000 310<U+2013>316"/><ref name="Tateishi 2009 536<U+2013>545"/> Domain unzipping coincides with the specific Ryr2 domain mutations associated with CPTV <ref name="Wehrens 2003 829<U+2013>840">{{cite journal|last=Wehrens|first=XH|coauthors=Lehnart SE, Huang F, Vest JA, Reiken SR, Mohler PJ, Sun J, Guatimosim S, Song LS, Rosemblit N, D'Armiento JM, Napolitano C, Memmi M, Priori SG, Lederer WJ, Marks AR |title=FKBP12.6 deficiency and defective calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor) function linked to exercise-induced sudden cardiac death |journal=Cell |year=2003|volume=113|pages=829<U+2013>840}}</ref> 
. The second theory of FKBP12.6 is more controversial <ref name="Wehrens 2003 829<U+2013>840"/> 
. FKBP12.6 is a RYR2 binding protein that stabilizes the receptor. FKBP12.6 binding to RYR2 is regulated by RYR2 phosphorylation  via PKA that results in the dissociation of FKBP12.6, rendering Ryr2 more sensitive to cytosolic calcium activation <ref>{{cite journal|last=Marx|first=SO|author2=Reiken S|author3=Hisamatsu Y|author4=Jayaraman T|author5=Burkhoff D|author6=Rosemblit N|author7=Marks AR|title=PKA phosphorylation dissociates FKBP12.6 from the calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor): defective regulation in failing hearts |journal=Cell|year=2000|volume=101|pages=365<U+2013>376}}</ref> 
. However, as mentioned above, evidence has been conflicted in determining FKBP12.6's role in CPTV.<ref name="Priori 2011 871<U+2013>883"/> So far the literature concludes that FKBP12.6 may play a role in certain CPTV mutations but not others, further research needs to clarify this protein's role.<ref name="Priori 2011 871<U+2013>883"/>

Mutations in the CASQ2 gene have been classified into 12 CPVT associated mutations: 4 are nonsense mutations causing shortening of proteins, and 8 are missense mutations. R33Q and D307H reduce CASQ2 protein to 5% and 45% of normal levels respectively, which reduces SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering and binding capacity.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="Song 2007 1814<U+2013>1823"/><ref name="Viatchenko-Karpinski 2004 471<U+2013>477"/><ref name="Lahat 2001 1378<U+2013>1384"/> The most severe missense mutation, D307H, converts aspartic acid (negatively charged) to a histidine within a Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelating region. This disrupts Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to CASQ2, but the specific mechanism behind this mutation is still undetermined.<ref name="Viatchenko-Karpinski 2004 471<U+2013>477"/><ref name="Lahat 2001 1378<U+2013>1384"/> The missense mutation R33Q causes a substitution of glutamine for arginine, decreasing the total amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stored in the SR, thus increasing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering system causing Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak through RYR2, where the mechanism behind this mutation is proposed to interact with triadin and/or junction forming "polar zippers".<ref name="Terentyev 2006 1151<U+2013>1158"/><ref name="Viatchenko-Karpinski 2004 471<U+2013>477"/>

There are two major theories as to what is occurring when CASQ2 is deficient.  It was found that decreased CASQ2 is associated with high levels of calreticulin (CRT).<ref name="Song 2007 1814<U+2013>1823"/> In the absence of CASQ2 signal, CRT levels increase and provide some compensatory SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding activity. CRT levels decrease significantly after birth and high levels are only present in the developing heart, leading to the theory of caused bradycardia and sinus node dysfunction which is found in CPTV patients.<ref name="Song 2007 1814<U+2013>1823"/> With the absence of CASQ2, it was also found that RYR2 activity remained high in diastole since CASQ2 could not provide the inhibitory response, causing a prolonged Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak which triggers early action potentials.<ref name="Faggioni 2012 959<U+2013>967"/><ref name="Song 2007 1814<U+2013>1823"/><ref name="Priori 2008 293<U+2013>301"/>  With reduced SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering capacity, is a faster recovery of SR free Ca<sup>2+</sup> after each Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, resulting in higher levels of SR free Ca<sup>2+</sup> and SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> loading, both increasing trigger activity and SOICR recurrence <ref name="ReferenceA"/>
.<ref name="Song 2007 1814<U+2013>1823"/> The exact mechanisms by which the mutations occur in the CASQ2 gene are still under investigation. Research underway is analyzing strategies to target RYR2 inhibition and approaches to increasing SR Ca<sup>2+</sup>.<ref name="Song 2007 1814<U+2013>1823"/>
