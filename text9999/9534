'''Ranchhodji Diwan''' (1768<U+2014>1841) was an [[author]] and the chief minister of [[Junagadh state]].

==Life==
Ranchhodji was a son of Amarji Diwan, the chief minister of Junagadh state. Upon death of his father, he was appointed as the chief minister. Although a [[Nagar Brahmin]] by caste, he had mastered the profession of arms. He had fought battles with states of [[Nawanagar State|Jamnagar]] and [[Cutch State|Cutch]]. In 1805, British agent Colonel Walker met Nawab of Junagadh state and it became British protectorate under [[East India Company]] in 1807. Thus Ranchhodji retired from battlefields and started writing [[poetry]]. He assisted the state in abolishing the practices of [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] and [[female infanticide]]. He was a follower of [[Shakti]].<ref name="Farquhar1984">{{cite book|author=J. N.

Many allusions have been made to him by English writers like [[John Malcolm]] and Mariana Postans. In [[Blackwood's Magazine]], the mention is made of his qualities. Postans, who saw him reposing under a vine-clad bower surrounded by a number of amanuenses, sitting on Persian carpets, says that, {{quote|text=...his large black eyes lustrous as burning lamps, were illumined by the fire of intellect within, and he was an acknowledged patron of poets, men of science and literary genius.|sign=Mariana Poshtans|source=''Western India in 1838'', Volume II, p. 126<ref name="Malabari1882"/>}}

==Works==
Ranchhodji knew Gujarati, Sanskrit and Persian languages. In Persian he has written the ''Tarikh-i-Sorath va Halar'', a history of [[Sorath]] and also the ''Rukat-i-Gunagun'' (various letters). He has translated into [[Braj Bhasha]], a work called the ''[[Shivarahasya Purana|Sivarahasya]]'', besides a number of other works. In Gujarati, he has also written about a dozen works, chief among them being the ''Ramayana Ramvalla'', ''Shivagita'' and ''Chandipath'' or ''Chandipath na Garba''.  ''Chandipath'' is Gujarati version of a [[Epic poetry|rhapsody]], ''[[Devi Mahatmya|Durga Saptashati]]'', narrating the forms and adventures of the goddess [[Shakti]].<ref name="Datta1988"/><ref name="Malabari1882"/><ref name=smg/><ref name="JhaveriAkademi1978">{{cite book|author1=Mansukhlal Maganlal Jhaveri|author2=Sahitya Akademi|title=History of Gujarati Literature|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DA0RAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=55}}</ref>
