The '''Rugby World Cup''' is a men's [[rugby union]] tournament contested every four years between the top international teams. The tournament was first held in 1987, when the tournament was co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia. The most recent tournament was held in [[2011 Rugby World Cup|2011]] in New Zealand, whose [[New Zealand national rugby union team|national team]] won the tournament by defeating [[France national rugby union team|France]] in the final.

The winners are awarded the [[William Webb Ellis Cup]], named after [[William Webb Ellis]], the [[Rugby School]] pupil who <U+2014> according to a popular myth <U+2014> invented rugby by picking up the ball during a football game.<!-- Not association football, which came after this alleged event --> Three teams have won the trophy twice, [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], New Zealand, and [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]]; while [[England national rugby union team|England]] have won the tournament once.

The tournament is administered by [[World Rugby]], the sport's international governing body. Sixteen teams were invited to participate in the inaugural tournament in 1987, however since 1999 twenty teams have taken part. England will host the [[2015 Rugby World Cup|2015 World Cup]], while Japan will host the event in 2019.

== Format ==

=== Qualification ===
{{Main|Rugby World Cup qualification}}
Qualifying tournaments were introduced for the [[1991 Rugby World Cup|second tournament]], where eight of the sixteen places were contested in a twenty-four-nation tournament.<ref name=Peatey59>Peatey (2011) p. 59.</ref> The [[1987 Rugby World Cup|inaugural World Cup]] in 1987, did not involve any qualifying process; instead, the 16 places were automatically filled by seven eligible [[World Rugby|International Rugby Football Board]] (IRFB, now World Rugby) member nations, and the rest by invitation.<ref name=Peatey34>Peatey (2011) p. 34.</ref>

The current format allows for twelve of the twenty available positions to be filled by automatic qualification, as the teams who finish third or better in the group (pool) stages of the previous tournament enter its successor (where they will be [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seeded]]).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/7258823.stm | work=BBC News | title=Rankings to determine RWC pools | date=22 February 2008 |accessdate=13 February 2013}}</ref><ref name=2008Seedings>{{cite news|title=AB boost as World Cup seedings confirmed|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/news/281939|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=stuff.co.nz|date=22 February 2008|agency=NZPA}}</ref> The qualification system for the remaining eight places is region-based, with Europe and the Americas allocated two qualifying places each, Africa, Asia and Oceania one place each, with the last place determined by a play-off.<ref name=Qualifying>{{cite news| url=http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/home/news/newsid=2022896.html#caribbean+kick+rwc+2011+qualifying |title=Caribbean kick off for RWC 2011 qualifying |publisher=irb.com |date=3 April 2008 |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>

The previous format, used in 2003 and 2007, allowed for eight of the twenty available positions to be filled by automatic qualification, as the eight quarter finalists of the previous tournament enter its successor. The remaining twelve positions were filled by [[continent]]al qualifying tournaments.<ref name="RNV38I9PG26">{{Cite news| title=Doin' it the Hard Way |magazine=Rugby News |volume=38 |issue=9 |year=2007 |page=26| postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Positions were filled by three teams from the Americas, one from Asia, one from Africa, three from Europe and two from Oceania.<ref name="RNV38I9PG26"/> Another two places were allocated for [[repechage]].

=== Tournament ===
The 2015 tournament will involve twenty nations competing over six weeks.<ref name=2008Seedings /><ref name="2015Fixtures">{{cite web| url=http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/home/fixturesresults/index.html |title=Fixtures and Results |accessdate=13 April 2014 |publisher=International Rugby Board}}</ref> There are two stages, a group and a knock-out.

The remaining positions in each pool are filled by the qualifiers.<ref name=2008Seedings /><ref name=2015Seedings>{{cite news | url = http://tvnz.co.nz/rugby-news/2015-world-cup-seedings-take-shape-5226586 | title = 2015 Rugby World Cup seedings take shape |publisher = tvnz.co.nz | accessdate = 13 April 2014 | date = 20 November 2012 | agency = AAP}}</ref>

Nations play four pool games, playing their respective pool members once each.<ref name="TournamentRules"/> A [[Rugby union bonus points system|bonus points system]] is used during pool play. If two or more teams are level on points, a system of criteria is used to determine the higher ranked; the sixth and final criterion decides the higher rank through the official World Rankings.<ref name="TournamentRules"/>

The winner and runner-up of each pool enter the knock-out stage. The knock-out stage consists of quarter- and semi-finals, and then the final. The winner of each pool is placed against a runner-up of a different pool in a quarter-final. The winner of each quarter-final goes on to the semi-finals, and the respective winners proceed to the final. Losers of the semi-finals contest for third place, called the 'Bronze Final'. If a match in the knock-out stages ends in a draw, the winner is determined through [[extra time]]. If that fails, the match goes into [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] and the next team to score any points is the winner. As a last resort, a kicking competition is used.<ref name="TournamentRules"/>

{{Main|History of the Rugby World Cup}}
[[File:2011 Rugby World Cup Wales vs Samoa (6168183024).jpg|right|300px|thumb|alt=A player holds a ball in front of two opposing groups of eight players. Each group is crouched and working together to push against the other team.|A scrum between [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]] (in blue) and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] (in red) during the 2011 World Cup]]
Prior to the Rugby World Cup, there were only regional international rugby union competitions. One of the largest and oldest is the [[Six Nations Championship]], which started in 1883 as the "[[Home Nations]]" championship, a tournament between [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]]. It became the Five Nations in 1910, when [[France national rugby union team|France]] joined the tournament. France did not participate from 1931 to 1939, during which period it reverted to  a Home Nations championship. In 2000, [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]] joined the competition, which became the Six Nations.<ref name="history">{{cite web | url=http://www.6-nations-rugby.com/six-nations-history | title=A brief history of the Six Nations rugby tournament | publisher=6 Nations Rugby | accessdate=31 October 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071108180856/http://www.6-nations-rugby.com/six-nations-history |archivedate = 8 November 2007}}</ref>

In the southern hemisphere, the equivalent competition is [[The Rugby Championship]], involving [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]], [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]], and [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]]. It began in 1996 as the Tri Nations with the latter three countries participating; Argentina debuted in the renamed competition in 2012.

Rugby union was also played at the [[Summer Olympics]], first appearing at the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Paris games]] and subsequently at [[1908 Summer Olympics|London in 1908]], [[1920 Summer Olympics|Antwerp in 1920]], and [[1924 Summer Olympics|Paris again in 1924]]. France won the first gold medal, then Australasia, with the last two being won by the United States. However rugby union was soon removed from the Summer Olympic program.<ref name="olympics1">{{cite web | url=http://www.irb.com/rugbyandtheolympics/history.html | title=Rugby in the Olympics: History | publisher= International Rugby Board | accessdate= 13 April 2014}}</ref><ref name="olympics2">{{cite web | url = http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/167592.html | title = Rugby and the Olympics | last = Richards | first = Huw | date = 26 July 2012 | accessdate = 13 April 2012 | publisher = ESPN}}</ref>

The idea of a Rugby World Cup had been suggested on numerous occasions going back to the 1950s, but met with opposition from most unions in the IRFB.  The idea resurfaced several times in the early 1980s, with the [[Australian Rugby Union]] (ARU) and the [[New Zealand Rugby Union]] (NZRU) independently writing to the IRFB seeking to conduct a World Cup tournament.<ref name="wcweb"/> In 1985, Australia, New Zealand and France were in favour of a world cup and, despite knowing that [[Sporting boycott of South Africa|the international sports boycott of the apartheid regime]] would prevent their participation, the South African delegates also voted in favour, which was vital in tying the vote 8<U+2013>8. When one English delegate followed by a Welsh delegate switched sides, the IRFB finally approved the inaugural cup, by 10 votes to 6.<ref name="wcweb">{{cite web | publisher=worldcupweb.com | title=The History of RWC |url=http://www.worldcupweb.com/WCrugby/history.asp|accessdate=25 April 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060414193531/http://www.worldcupweb.com/WCrugby/history.asp |archivedate = 14 April 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

The inaugural tournament, jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand, was held in May and June 1987, with sixteen nations taking part. [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] became the first ever champions, defeating [[France national rugby union team|France]] 29<U+2013>9 in the final. The subsequent [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991 tournament]] was hosted by [[England]], with matches being played throughout [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Ireland]] and [[France]]. This tournament also saw the abolition of invitation qualification, with a qualifying tournament being introduced which involved thirty-five nations. [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] won the second tournament, defeating [[England national rugby union team|England]] 12<U+2013>6 in the final.

The [[1995 Rugby World Cup|1995 tournament]] was hosted by [[South Africa]] and was the first in which South Africa participated, following the end of the international sports boycott. The tournament had a fairytale ending, as South Africa were crowned champions over New Zealand, with then President [[Nelson Mandela]], wearing a [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springbok]] [[Rugby shirt|jersey]] and matching baseball cap, presenting the trophy to South Africa's captain, [[Francois Pienaar]]. The tournament in [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999]] was hosted by Wales with matches also being held throughout the rest of the United Kingdom, Ireland and France. The tournament included a [[repechage]] system, alongside specific regional qualifying places, and an increase from sixteen to twenty participating nations. Australia claimed their second title, defeating France in the final.

The [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003 event]] was hosted by Australia, although it was originally intended to be held jointly with New Zealand. England emerged as champions defeating Australia in extra time. England's win was unique in that it broke the [[SANZAR|southern hemisphere]]'s dominance in the event. Such was the celebration of England's victory, that an estimated 750,000 people gathered in central [[London]] to greet the team, making the day the largest sporting celebration of its kind ever in the United Kingdom.<ref name="bbcrwc">{{cite news | publisher=bbc.co.uk | title=England honours World Cup stars |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/rugby_world_cup/3300061.stm|accessdate=2006-05-03 | date=2003-12-09}}</ref>

The [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007 competition]] was hosted by France, with matches also being held in Wales and Scotland. South Africa claimed their second title by defeating defending champions England 15<U+2013>6.  The [[2011 Rugby World Cup|2011 tournament]] was awarded to New Zealand in November 2005, ahead of bids from [[Japan]] and South Africa. The All Blacks reclaimed their place atop the rugby world with a narrow 8<U+2013>7 win over France in the 2011 final.

Rugby World Cup Limited recommended to the IRB that the [[2015 Rugby World Cup|2015]] and [[2019 Rugby World Cup|2019]] World Cups be held in England and Japan, respectively, and in July 2009 it was announced that this proposal was adopted.<ref>[http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2032580.html#rwcl+recommends+england+japan International Rugby Board - RWCL recommends England and Japan<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Trophy ==
{{Main|Webb Ellis Cup}}
The Webb Ellis Cup is the prize presented to winners of the Rugby World Cup, named after [[William Webb Ellis]]. The trophy is also referred to simply as the ''Rugby World Cup''. The trophy was chosen in 1987 as an appropriate cup for use in the competition, and was created in 1906 by Garrard's Crown Jewellers.<ref name=RWCTrophy>{{cite news|title=Second World Cup exists, Snedden confirms|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10745840|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|date=18 August 2011}}</ref><ref name=QuinnPt3>{{cite news|last=Quinn|first=Keith|title=Keith Quinn: Back-history of RWC - part three|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/rugby-world-cup/keith-quinn-back-history-rwc-part-three-4374234|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=TVNZ|date=30 August 2011}}</ref> The words 'The International Rugby Football Board' and 'The Webb Ellis Cup' are engraved on the face of the cup.

== Selection of hosts ==
{{Main|Rugby World Cup hosts}}
Tournaments are organised by Rugby World Cup Ltd (RWCL), which is itself owned by World Rugby. The selection of host is decided by a vote of World Rugby Council members.<ref>{{cite web | title=Official Website of the Rugby World Cup | url=http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/en/home/Disclaimer | work=rugbyworldcup.com | accessdate=14 April 2007| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070202143044/http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/en/home/Disclaimer| archivedate = 2 February 2007}}</ref><ref name=JapEng2019>{{cite news|title=England awarded 2015 Rugby World Cup|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-07-29/england-awarded-2015-rugby-world-cup/1371384|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=ABC News Australia|date=29 July 2009|agency=AFP}}</ref>  The voting procedure is managed by a team of independent auditors, and the voting kept secret. The allocation of a tournament to a host nation is now made five or six years prior to the commencement of the event, for example New Zealand were awarded the 2011 event in late 2005.

The tournament has been hosted by multiple nations. For example the 1987 tournament was co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand. World Rugby requires that the hosts must have a venue with a capacity of at least 60,000 spectators for the final.<ref name=RWCStadium>{{cite news|title=New Zealand came close to losing Rugby World Cup 2011|url=http://www.rugbyweek.com/news/article.asp?id=17256|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=Rugby Week|date=12 December 2008}}</ref> Host nations sometimes construct or upgrade stadia in preparation for the World Cup, such as [[Millennium Stadium]] <U+2013> purpose built for the 1999 tournament <U+2013> and [[Eden Park]], upgraded for 2011.<ref name=RWCStadium/><ref name="millen">{{cite web | title=Millennium Stadium, Cardiff  | work=Virtual Tourist | url=http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Europe/United_Kingdom/Wales/South_Glamorgan/Cardiff-315777/Things_To_Do-Cardiff-Millennium_Stadium-BR-1.html |accessdate=23 February 2007}}</ref> The first country outside of the traditional rugby nations of [[SANZAR]] or the Six Nations to be awarded the hosting rights was Japan, who will host the [[2019 Rugby World Cup|2019 tournament]].

==Tournament growth==

=== Media coverage ===
Organizers of the 2015 tournament in England call the Rugby World Cup the third largest sporting event in the World, behind only the [[FIFA World Cup]] and the [[Olympics]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hospitality.rugbyworldcup.com/rugby_world_cup_2015_official_hospitality_in_numbers.aspx |title=Rugby World Cup 2015 Official Hospitality |author= |publisher=RWC Ltd |date= |accessdate=2014-12-04}}</ref>

Reports emanating from World Rugby and its business partners have frequently touted the tournament's media growth, with cumulative worldwide television audiences of 300 million for the inaugural 1987 tournament, 1.75 billion in 1991, 2.67 billion in 1995, 3 billion in 1999,<ref name="seven">{{cite web | title=Rugby World Cup 2003 | work=sevencorporate.com.au | url=http://www.sevencorporate.com.au/page.asp?partid=225 |accessdate=2006-04-25|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060415041733/http://www.sevencorporate.com.au/page.asp?partid=225 |archivedate = April 15, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref> 3.5 billion in 2003,<ref name="visa">{{cite web | title=Visa International Renews Rugby World Cup Partnership | work=corporate.visa.com | url=http://www.corporate.visa.com/md/nr/press269.jsp | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060427071525/http://www.corporate.visa.com/md/nr/press269.jsp | archivedate=2006-04-27 |accessdate=2006-04-25}}</ref> and 4 billion in 2007.<ref name=Deloitte2008>{{cite web | url = http://www.deloitte.com/assets/dcom-unitedkingdom/Local%20assets/documents/uk_SBG_IrB2008.pdf |title = Potential Impact of the Rugby World Cup on a Host Nation | year = 2008 | accessdate = 12 April 2014 | publisher = Deloitte & Touche | page = 5}}</ref><br />
However, independent reviews have called into question the methodology of those growth estimates, pointing to factual inconsistencies.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10642274 |title=Filling the Cup - cost $500m and climbing |author=Nippert, Matt |work = New Zealand Herald |publisher=APN New Zealand |date=2010-05-02 |accessdate=2014-12-02}}</ref> The event's supposed drawing power outside of a handful of rugby strongholds was also downplayed significantly, with an estimated 97 percent of the 33 million average audience produced by the 2007 final coming from [[Australasia]], South Africa, the [[British Isles]] and France.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=10761073 |title=Logic debunks outrageous numbers game |author=Burgess, Michael|work = New Zealand Herald |publisher=APN New Zealand |date=2011-10-23 |accessdate=2014-12-02}}</ref> Other sports have been accused of exaggerating their television reach over the years; such claims are not exclusive to the Rugby World Cup.

While the event's global popularity remains a matter of dispute, high interest in traditional rugby nations is well documented. The 2003 final, between Australia and England, became the most watched [[rugby union]] match in the history of Australian television.<ref name="tv">{{cite news | last=Derriman | first=Phillip | date = 2006-07-01 | title=Rivals must assess impact of Cup fever | work = Sydney Morning Herald | publisher = Fairfax | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/sport/rivals-must-assess-impact-of-cup-fever/2006/06/30/1151174394285.html?page=2 |accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref>

=== Performance of nations ===
[[Image:Rugby world cup countries best results and hosts rev1.png|thumb|right|Map of nations' best results (excluding qualifying tournaments).]]
{{See also|National team appearances in the Rugby World Cup}}
Twenty-five nations have participated at the Rugby World Cup (excluding qualifying tournaments). Of the seven tournaments that have been held, all but one have been won by a national team from the [[southern hemisphere]].<ref name="RNV38I9PG32-33">{{Cite news |magazine=Rugby News |title=Only the Strong Survive |volume=38 |issue=9 |pages=32<U+2013>33 |year=2007 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> The southern hemisphere's dominance has been broken only in 2003, when England beat Australia in the final.<ref name="RNV38I9PG32-33"/>

Thus far the only nations to host and win a tournament are New Zealand (1987 and 2011) and South Africa (1995). The performance of other host nations includes England (1991 final hosts) and Australia (2003 hosts) finishing runners-up. France (2007 hosts) finished fourth, while Wales (1999 hosts) failed to reach the semi-finals. Of the twenty-five nations that have ever participated in at least one tournament, twelve of them have never missed a tournament.<ref>Argentina, Australia, Canada, England, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Romania, Scotland and Wales are the nations that have never missed a tournament, playing in all seven thus far. South Africa has played in all five in the post-apartheid era.</ref>
