'''''The Knight of the Sacred Lake''''' is a 2001 historical fantasy novel by [[Rosalind Miles]].

==Plot introduction==
'''''The Knight of the Sacred Lake''''' is a variant of an [[Arthurian legend]]. It follows the lives of [[Guinevere|Queen Guinevere]], or Guenevere, and her strife with [[Agravain]] and [[Gawain]], as well as that of her lover's, [[Lancelot]], as they both enter different paths in their lives, away from each other.

==Plot summary==
{{spoiler}}
As High King and Queen, [[Arthur]] and Guenevere reign supreme across the many kingdoms of [[Great Britain]]. Still, Guenevere secretly mourns the loss of her beloved Lancelot, who has returned to the Sacred Lake of his boyhood, hoping to restore his faith in chivalry in the place where he learned to be a knight. In a glittering Pentecost ceremony, new knights are sworn to the Round Table, including Arthur's nephews, Agravain and Gawain. After many years of strife, peace is restored to Guenevere's realm.

But betrayal, jealousy, and ancient blood feuds fester unseen. [[Morgan le Fay]], now the mother of Arthur's only son, [[Mordred]], has become the focus of [[Merlin|Merlin's]] age-old quest to ensure the survival of the house of [[Pendragon]]. From the east comes the shattering news that Guenevere may have a rival for Lancelot's love. A bleak shadow falls again across [[Camelot]]--and across the sacred isle of [[Avalon]], where [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman]] priests threaten the life of the Lady herself. At the center of the storm is Guenevere, torn between her love for her husband, her people, and Sir Lancelot of the Lake.

==Literary significance & criticism==
*"The popular and prolific Miles injects the tale with poesy... an engrossing if unorthodox read. No doubt Miles's fans will be pleased with this lush, feminist take on the English epic."
