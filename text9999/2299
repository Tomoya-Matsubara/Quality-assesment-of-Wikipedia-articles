==Playing career==
===Minor leagues===
Burrows played two seasons of [[junior hockey#Major-Junior|major junior]] in the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] (QMJHL) with the [[Shawinigan Cataractes]].  Undrafted by an [[National Hockey League|NHL]] club, Burrows joined the [[ECHL]] with the [[Greenville Grrrowl]] in [[2002<U+2013>03 ECHL season|2002<U+2013>03]].  Late in his professional rookie season, he transferred to the [[Baton Rouge Kingfish]] and finished with a combined 32 points in 66 games between the two teams.  

The following season, in [[2003<U+2013>04 ECHL season|2003<U+2013>04]], he returned to the South Division, signed by the [[Vancouver Canucks]]' ECHL affiliate, the [[Columbia Inferno]].  He was suspended for three games and fined an undisclosed amount on November 3, 2003, for abusing officials during a game on October 24 against [[Greensboro Generals]].<ref>{{citenews|title=title=Transactions|url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=a5Y1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=8igMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3791,1563698&dq=alexandre-burrows&hl=en|accessdate=2010-04-02|date=2003-11-04|publisher=''[[Observer-Reporter]]''}}</ref>  He finished the season improving to 29 goals and 73 points, second in team scoring to league scoring champion [[Tim Smith (ice hockey)|Tim Smith]].<ref>{{Citeweb|title=2003-04 Columbia Inferno [ECHL]|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/teams/0026962004.html|accessdate=2009-03-31|publisher=HockeyDb.com}}</ref>  During the season, he was named to the 2004 [[ECHL All-Star Game]] for the Eastern Conference and recorded one assist.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Walby Shows Skills Among ECHL All-Stars|url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=2995465|accessdate=2009-03-31|date=2004-01-20|publisher=OurSports Central}}</ref><ref name=moosecontract/>  Following the competition, the ''[[Peoria Journal-Star]]'', a local newspaper of the All-Star Game host city, conducted a survey of the NHL scouts in attendance and listed Burrows as one of the top four prospects at the game.<ref>{{Citeweb|title=ECHL notebook 01/25/04|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/012504/lyn_041-2061.000.shtml|accessdate=2009-03-31|date=2004-01-25|publisher=''[[Augusta Chronicle]]''}}</ref>  Early in Burrows' All-Star season with Columbia, he was also signed by their [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) affiliate, the [[Manitoba Moose]] on October 21, 2003,<ref name=moosecontract>{{citeweb|title=Moose Sign Eastman and Burrows|url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3069970&l_id=&t_id=|accessdate=2009-03-31|date=2003-10-21|publisher=OurSports Central}}</ref> having been scouted by general manager [[Craig Heisinger]].<ref>{{citenews|title=Bird dog bolsters Canucks|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/AHL/2005/11/11/1302515-sun.html|accessdate=2010-04-02|date=2005-11-11|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|author=Adam Wazny}}</ref>  He debuted in 2 AHL games for them before being sent back down to the ECHL.

In [[2007<U+2013>08 NHL season|2007<U+2013>08]], Burrows formed an effective two-way shutdown duo with center [[Ryan Kesler]], countering opposing teams' top lines while contributing offensively, as well.<ref>{{citeweb|title=It takes two|url=http://canucks.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=355420|accessdate=2009-02-05|date=2008-03-01|publisher=[[Vancouver Canucks]]}}</ref><ref>{{Citeweb|title=Kesler, Burrows score A in chemistry|url=http://www2.canada.com/theprovince/news/sports/story.html?id=b8491154-a15f-48ff-8c2b-266fe7060216|accessdate=2009-03-31|date=2008-03-12|publisher=''[[The Province]]''}}</ref>  He completed the season with a career high 12 goals, 31 points and a team high [[plus/minus]] of +11, resulting in his first of two consecutive team [[Most Exciting Player Award]]s.  

After remaining on the third line with Kesler at the start of the following season, head coach [[Alain Vigneault]] separated the two after the [[NHL All-Star Game|All-Star]] break, placing Burrows on the first line with [[Daniel Sedin|Daniel]] and [[Henrik Sedin]], beginning on February 12, 2009, during a game against the [[Phoenix Coyotes]].<ref>{{Citeweb|title=Burrows, Kesler better off separate|url=http://www.theprovince.com/sports/Burrows+Kesler+better+separate/1309235/story.html|accessdate=2009-03-31|date=2009-02-20|publisher=''[[The Province]]''}}</ref><ref name=promotion>{{citenews|title=Burrows earns promotion|url=http://www.faceoff.com/hockey/teams/vancouver-canucks/story.html?id=1287412&add_feed_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.faceoff.com%2Fscripts%2FSP6Atom.aspx%3Fid%3D830270|accessdate=2010-03-15|date=2009-02-13|publisher=''[[Vancouver Sun]]''|author=Brad Ziemer}}</ref>  Burrows' crash-the-net style combined well with the Sedin's cycling.<ref>{{citenews|title=Canucks' Alex Burrows is modest about his legend label|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nhl/article/2009-04-22/canucks-alex-burrows-modest-about-his-legend-label|accessdate=2010-04-02|date=2009-04-22|publisher=''[[Sporting News]]''|author=[[Canadian Press]]}}</ref>  Vigneault's line juggling was precipitated by a losing skid in January.

====NHL officials controversy====
The night of his first star of the week selection, Burrows and the Canucks played a controversial game against the [[Nashville Predators]].  With the game tied 2<U+2013>2 in the third period, Burrows was penalized twice by referee [[St<U+00E9>phane Auger]] <U+2013> once for diving and the other for interference.<ref name=auger/>  The latter call was deemed questionable by media sources, including [[The Sports Network|TSN]] and the ''[[National Post]]''.<ref name=NP>{{Citation| last=Arthur| first=Bruce| title=Whither The Truth?| newspaper=National Post| date=14 January 2010| url=http://www.nationalpost.com/opinion/columnists/story.html?id=e38aa480-837e-4bdd-966c-2f32237ce534| accessdate=14 January 2010}}</ref> The interference penalty along with a tripping penalty committed by Henrik Sedin resulted in Nashville's game-winning, 5-on-3 powerplay goal late in the game.<ref name=auger/>  With three seconds to go in regulation, Burrows skated by Auger and protested the interference penalty, resulting in an unsportsmanlike minor and a ten-minute misconduct.<ref name=auger/>  Following the game, Burrows accused Auger of having a personal vendetta against him for a play against the Predators the previous month in December.  After Burrows had been hit into the boards by Nashville forward [[Jerred Smithson]], Auger assessed Smithson with a five-minute major and a match penalty that the league later rescinded because it was believed Burrows had dived.<ref name=fine>{{Citeweb|title=NHL officially fines Canucks' Burrows for outburst|url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/teams/story/?id=305967&hubname=nhl-canucks|accessdate=2010-01-14|date=2010-01-13|publisher=[[The Sports Network]]}}</ref>  Burrows claimed that Auger told him before the January 11 game: "you made me look bad so I'm going to get you back tonight."
