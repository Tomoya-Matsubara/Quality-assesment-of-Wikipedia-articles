|}The '''1999 South Dakota Learjet crash''' involved a chartered [[Learjet 35/36|Learjet 35]] flying between [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]] and [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]]. Early in the flight, the aircraft was cruising at altitude on autopilot and gradually lost cabin pressure. As a result, all on board died of [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], a lack of oxygen. The aircraft continued its flight over the southern and midwestern United States for almost four hours and 1,500 miles, until it ran out of fuel and crashed into a field near [[Aberdeen, South Dakota]] after an uncontrolled descent.<ref name="ntsb1">[http://www.ntsb.gov/Publictn/2000/aab0001.htm Aircraft Accident Brief, N47BA]</ref> Among the six people on board were [[golf]] star [[Payne Stewart]] and [[Bruce Borland]], a highly-regarded golf architect with the [[Jack Nicklaus]] golf course design company.

==Flight chronology==
:''Note: all times are presented in 24-hour, military format. Because the flight took place in both the [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time zone]] and the [[Central Time zone]], all times are given in this article in [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (which is indicated by the time followed by the letter Z)''
===Departure===
[[Image:NTSB-N47BA-slide0046 image002.jpg|thumb|right|Ground track of N47BA from departure to crash site]]On [[October 25]], [[1999 in aviation|1999]] Learjet 35, registration N47BA, operated by [[Sunjet Aviation, Inc.]], of Sanford, Florida, departed Orlando {{Airport codes|MCO|KMCO}} at 1319Z (0919 EDT) on a two-day, five-flight trip. Prior to departure, the aircraft had been fueled with 5,300 lbs of [[Jet fuel|Jet A]], enough for 4 hours and 45 minutes of flight. On board were two pilots and four passengers.<ref name="ntsb1"/>

At 1327:13Z, the [[Air traffic controller|controller]] from the [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] [[Area Control Center|ARTCC]] instructed the pilot to climb and maintain [[flight level]] (FL) 390 (39,000 feet above sea level). At 1327:18 EDT, the pilot acknowledged the clearance by stating, "three nine zero bravo alpha." This was the last known radio transmission from the airplane, and occurred while the aircraft was passing through 23,000 feet. The next attempt to contact the aircraft occurred six minutes, 20 seconds later (14 minutes after departure), with the aircraft at 36,500 feet, and the controller's message went unacknowledged. The controller attempted to contact N47BA five more times in the next 4<U+00BD> minutes, again with no answer.<ref name="ntsb1"/>

===First interception===
About 1454Z (now 0952 CDT due to the flight's crossing into the Central Time zone), a [[U.S. Air Force]] [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] [[test pilot]] from the [[40th Flight Test Squadron]] at [[Eglin Air Force Base]], Florida, who happened to be in the air nearby, was directed by controllers to intercept N47BA. When the fighter was about 2,000 feet from the Learjet, at an altitude of about 46,400 feet, the test pilot made two radio calls to N47BA but did not receive a response. The F-16 pilot made a visual inspection of the Lear, finding no visible damage to the airplane. Both engines were running, and the plane's red rotating Anti-collision beacon was on (standard operation for aircraft in flight). The fighter pilot could not see inside the passenger section of the airplane because the windows seemed to be dark. Further, he stated that the entire right cockpit windshield was opaque, as if condensation or ice covered the inside. He also indicated that the left cockpit windshield was opaque, although several sections of the center of the windshield seemed to be only thinly covered by condensation or ice; a small rectangular section of the windshield was clear, with only a small section of the glare shield visible through this area. He did not see any flight control movement. About 1512Z, the F-16 pilot concluded his inspection of N47BA and broke formation, proceeding to [[Scott AFB]], [[Illinois]].<ref name="ntsb1"/>

===Second interception===
At 1613Z, almost three hours into the flight of the unresponsive Learjet, two F-16s from the [[Oklahoma]] [[Air National Guard]] (ANG), flying under the call-sign "TULSA 13 flight", were directed by the [[Minneapolis]] ARTCC to intercept. The TULSA 13 lead pilot reported that he could not see any movement in the cockpit, that the windshield was dark and that he could not tell if the windshield was iced. A few minutes later, a TULSA 13 pilot reported, "We're not seeing anything inside, could be just a dark cockpit though...he is not reacting, moving or anything like that he should be able to have seen us by now." At 1639Z, TULSA 13 left to rendezvous with a tanker for [[Aerial refueling|refueling]].<ref name="ntsb1"/>

The aircraft's altitude varied from 22,000 feet to 51,000 feet.<ref name="post">{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/oct99/crash26.htm|title= Golfer Payne Stewart Dies in Jet Crash|author=Edward Walsh and William Claiborne|publisher=Washington Post|date=26 October 1999|accessdate=19 April 2007}} Appeared on page A1.</ref>

===Third interception and escort===
About 1650Z, two [[North Dakota]] ANG F-16s with the identification "NODAK 32 flight" were directed to intercept N47BA. TULSA 13 flight also returned from refueling, and all four fighters maneuvered close to the Lear. The TULSA 13 lead pilot reported, "We've got two visuals on it. It's looking like the cockpit window is iced over and there's no displacement in any of the control surfaces as far as the [[aileron]]s or trims." About 1701Z, TULSA 13 flight returned to the tanker again, while NODAK 32 remained with N47BA.<ref name="ntsb1"/>

===Crash===
[[Image:Ntsb-N47BA-scene-1.jpg|thumb|right|Crash crater, from NTSB presentation]][[Image:NTSB-N47BA-slide0026 background.jpg|thumb|right|Crash scene]]The Learjet's [[cockpit voice recorder]] (CVR), which was recovered from the wreckage, contained an audio recording of the last 30 minutes of the flight (it was an older model which only recorded 30 minutes of data; the aircraft was not equipped with a [[flight data recorder]]). At 1710:41Z, the Learjet's engines can be heard winding down, indicating that the plane's fuel had been exhausted. In additions, sounds of the [[stick shaker]] and [[autopilot]] disconnect can be heard (with the engines powered down, the autopilot would have attempted to maintain altitude, causing the plane's [[airspeed]] to bleed off until it approached [[Stall (flight)|stall]] speed, at which point the stick shaker would have automatically engaged to warn the pilot and the autopilot would have switched itself off).<ref name="ntsb1"/>

At 1711:01Z, the Lear began a right turn and descent. One NODAK 32 airplane remained to the west, while one TULSA 13 airplane broke away from the tanker and followed N47BA down. At 1211:26 CDT, the NODAK 32 lead pilot reported, "The target is descending and he is doing multiple aileron rolls, looks like he's out of control...in a severe descent, request an emergency descent to follow target." The TULSA 13 pilot reported, "It's soon to impact the ground he is in a descending spiral."<ref name="ntsb1"/>

Impact occurred approximately 1713Z, or 1213 local, after a total flight time of 3 hours, 54 minutes, with the aircraft hitting the ground at a nearly supersonic speed and an extreme angle.<ref name="ntsb3">[http://www.ntsb.gov/Speeches/former/hall/jhc001128.htm NTSB Board presention]</ref> The Learjet crashed just outside of Mina, South Dakota, in [[Edmunds County, South Dakota|Edmunds County]] on relatively flat ground, and left a crater 42 feet long, 21 feet wide and 8 feet deep. None of its components remained intact.<ref name="ntsb1"/>

==Crew information==
The 42-year-old captain, Michael Kling, held an [[Pilot certification in the United States#Airline transport pilot|airline transport pilot certificate]] and [[Pilot certification in the United States|type ratings]] for [[Boeing 707]], [[Boeing 707|Boeing 720]], and [[Learjet 35]]. He also had Air Force experience flying the [[KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135]] and [[E-3 Sentry]]. He was also an instructor pilot on a [[Maine]] ANG KC-135E. According to Sunjet Aviation records, the captain had accumulated a total of 4,280 hours of flight time (including his military flight time), had  flown  a  total  of 60  hours  with  Sunjet  Aviation,  38  hours  as  a   Learjet pilot-in-command and 22 hours as a Learjet second-in-command.<ref name="ntsb1"/> 

The first officer, Stephanie Bellegarrigue, age 27 at the time of the accident, held a [[Pilot certification in the United States#Commercial|commercial pilot certificate]] and type ratings for Learjet and Cessna Citation 500. She was also a certified flight instructor. She had accumulated a total of 1,751 hours of flight time, 251 hours with Sunjet Aviation as a second-in-command, 99 hours of which were as a Learjet second-in-command.<ref name="ntsb1"/>

==Investigation==
The [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) has several levels of investigation, the highest of which is a "major" investigation. In the last 10 years, the NTSB has conducted 35 major investigations of aircraft crashes. Because of the extraordinary circumstances in this crash, a major investigation was performed.<ref name="ntsb2">[http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/major.asp NTSB Major Investigations summary web page]</ref>

The NTSB determined that:

{{cquote|The probable cause of this accident was incapacitation of the flight crewmembers as a result of their failure to receive supplemental oxygen following a loss of cabin pressurization, for undetermined reasons.}}

In addition, the Board concluded:

{{cquote|Following the depressurization, the pilots did not receive supplemental oxygen in sufficient time and/or adequate concentration to avoid hypoxia and incapacitation. The wreckage indicated that the oxygen bottle pressure regulator/shutoff valve was open on the accident flight. Further, although one flight crew mask hose connector was found in the wreckage disconnected from its valve receptacle (the other connector was not recovered), damage to the recovered connector and both receptacles was consistent with both flight crew masks having been connected to the airplane's oxygen supply lines at the time of impact. In addition, both flight crew mask microphones were found plugged in to their respective crew microphone jacks. Therefore, assuming the oxygen bottle contained an adequate supply of oxygen, supplemental oxygen should have been available to both pilots' oxygen masks. 

[A] possible explanation for the failure of the pilots to receive emergency oxygen is that their ability to think and act decisively was impaired because of hypoxia before they could don their oxygen masks. No definitive evidence exists that indicates the rate at which the accident flight lost its cabin pressure; therefore, the Safety Board evaluated conditions of both rapid and gradual depressurization.

If there had been a breach in the fuselage (even a small one that could not be visually detected by the in-flight observers) or a seal failure, the cabin could have depressurized gradually, rapidly, or even explosively. Research has shown that a period of as little as 8 seconds without supplemental oxygen following rapid depressurization to about 30,000 feet may cause a drop in oxygen saturation that can significantly impair cognitive functioning and increase the amount of time required to complete complex tasks.

A more gradual decompression could have resulted from other possible causes, such as a smaller leak in the pressure vessel or a closed flow control valve. Safety Board testing determined that a closed flow control valve would cause complete depressurization to the airplane's flight altitude over a period of several minutes. However, without supplemental oxygen, substantial adverse effects on cognitive and motor skills would have been expected soon after the first clear indication of decompression (the cabin altitude warning), when the cabin altitude reached 10,000 feet (which could have occurred in about 30 seconds).

Investigations of other accidents in which flight crews attempted to diagnose a pressurization problem or initiate emergency pressurization instead of immediately donning oxygen masks following a cabin altitude alert have revealed that, even with a relatively gradual rate of depressurization, pilots have rapidly lost cognitive or motor abilities to effectively troubleshoot the problem or don their masks shortly thereafter. In this accident, the flight crew's failure to obtain supplemental oxygen in time to avoid incapacitation could be explained by a delay in donning oxygen masks of only a few seconds in the case of an explosive or rapid decompression or a slightly longer delay in the case of a gradual decompression.

In summary, the Safety Board was unable to determine why the flight crew could not, or did not, receive supplemental oxygen in sufficient time and/or adequate concentration to avoid hypoxia and incapacitation.<ref name="ntsb1"/>}}

==Shoot-down speculation==
There was some speculation in the media that military jets were prepared to shoot down the Lear if it threatened to crash in a heavily populated area. Officials at the Pentagon strongly denied that possibility. Shooting down the plane "was never an option," Air Force spokesman Captain Joe Della Vedova said. "I don't know where that came from."<ref name="cnn1">[http://www.cnn.com/US/9910/25/wayward.jet.07/ CNN news report]</ref>

==Aftermath==
The 2000 [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], held at [[Pebble Beach Golf Links]], began with 21 of Stewart's fellow players simultaneously hitting balls into the Pacific Ocean in a golf version of the [[21-gun salute]].

In 2001, Stewart was posthumously inducted into the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]].

On [[June 8]] [[2005]], a Florida state court jury in Orlando found that Learjet was not liable for the deaths of Stewart and his agent Robert Fraley, who had also been aboard the plane.

==Similar incidents==
While this type of crew incapacitation is extremely rare, it is not unheard of. Several similar accidents have occurred in the last 30 years.
===The 1980 Bo Rein crash===
[[Bo Rein|Robert Edward "Bo" Rein]], a noted [[football]] coach for [[North Carolina State University|North Carolina State]] and [[Louisiana State University]] was flying with a pilot from [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] to [[Baton Rouge]] on [[January 10]], [[1980]] in his [[Cessna 441]] Conquest twin-turboprop, registered N442NC. The flight was supposed to be a 40-minute trip, but after flying east and climbing to avoid a thunderstorm, air traffic control lost contact with the plane, which was seen on radar to climb to 40,000 feet. 

The Conquest was eventually intercepted by two [[Michigan Air National Guard]] [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4C Phantoms]] from [[Seymour Johnson Air Force Base|Seymour-Johnson AFB]] and a pair of [[F-106 Delta Dart]] interceptors from the 48th Fighter Interceptor Squadron at [[Langley Air Force Base|Langley AFB]] aircraft over [[North Carolina]], a thousand miles off course.<ref name="uav">[http://forums.jetcareers.com/showthread.php?t=19065 "Flight of the Unintentional UAV", JetCareers.com]</ref> When intercepted, the Cessna was at 41,600 feet, 5,000 feet higher than its maximum certified ceiling. The fighter pilots could not see anyone in the cockpit. The plane continued out over the [[Atlantic Ocean]], where it ran out of fuel, descended to 25,000 feet and then entered a spin, crashing into the water.<ref>[http://www.planecrashinfo.com/1980/1980-2.htm Crash synopsis at PlaneCrashInfo]</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952543,00.html ''Time'' magazine online synopsis]</ref> The military pilots spotted some debris, but no wreckage was ever recovered. The bodies of Rein and pilot Lou Benscotter were never found. The most likely reason given was that the two men apparently lost consciousness due to slow depressurization of the cabin. Cessna later settled out of court with his widow for an undisclosed amount.<ref>[http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/brief.asp?ev_id=32586&key=0 NTSB summary]</ref>

===The 1983 Scotland Learjet 25 crash===
On [[May 18]], [[1983 in aviation|1983]], a [[Learjet 25|Learjet 25B]] flying from [[Vienna International Airport|Wien-Schwechat International Airport]], [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] to [[Hamburg Airport|Hamburg-Fuhlsb<U+00FC>ttel Airport]], [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]], did not respond to controllers' requests 40 minutes after takeoff. The aircraft, registered D-CDPD and operated by Air Traffic Executive Jet, was carrying two crew and one passenger. It continued in flight at 39,000 feet until its fuel was exhausted. It crashed into the [[Atlantic]] 350 miles (560 km) northwest of [[Scotland]].<ref>[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19830518-0&lang=en Information page from Aviation Safety Network]</ref>

===The 1988 Mexico Learjet 24 crash===
A [[Learjet 24|Lear 24B]], N234CM, departed [[Memphis International Airport]] on [[December 16]], [[1988 in aviation|1988]], heading for [[Addison, Texas]] with two crew aboard, including NASA astronaut-candidate Susan Reynolds. After it flew past its destination, the aircraft was intercepted by an Air Force [[T-38 Talon]] from the 560th Flying Training Squadron at [[Randolph Air Force Base|Randolph AFB]], but the pilot was unable to contact the crew. He reported that the cockpit windows appeared to have frost on the inside of them. The Lear entered [[Mexico|Mexican]] airspace. After exhausting its fuel supply, it entered a spin and crashed near [[Cuatro Ci<U+00E9>negas]] in the northern state of [[Coahuila]]. The two pilots were killed.<ref name="uav"/><ref>[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19881216-0&lang=en Brief from Air Safety Network]</ref>

===The 2000 Queensland King Air crash===
On [[September 4]], [[2000 in aviation|2000]] a chartered [[Beechcraft King Air]] 200 operated by Central Air departed from [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Australia]], destined for [[Leonora]], a mining town 370 miles (600 km) away, carrying seven passengers plus the pilot.<ref name="atsb">{{ATSBLink | type =A | year =2000 | occno =200003771 | title = Beech Aircraft Corp 200, VH-SKC | accessdate = 2007-06-09}}</ref><ref name="abc-aus2">[http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2003/s860702.htm Nick McKenzie, "Family of Ghost Flight plane crash victims angry with aviation regulator, CASA", ''ABC-PM'' [[2003-05-21]]]</ref> After 22 minutes of flight, the aircraft had passed through its assigned altitude, when it was at this point that [[Air Traffic Control|ATC]] noticed that the pilots speech had become significantly impaired and he was unable to respond to instructions.<ref name="atsb"/> Communications continued with the pilot for a further eight minutes, before he lapsed into unconsciousness and no sounds of life on board could be heard.<ref name="atsb"/> Two other general aviation aircraft, one belonging to the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service]], had shadowed the King Air and attempted unsuccessfully to make radio contact. They reported that everyone onboard appeared to be unconscious.<ref name="peoples"/>

The plane continued uncontrolled flight for five hours, covering 1,760 miles (2,840 km), before running out of fuel and crashing 65 km ESE Burketown, in northwest Queensland, at 0210 local time.<ref name="peoples">[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/english/200009/05/eng20000905_49748.html "Plane Crashes in Australia, All Eight Aboard Dead", ''Peoples Daily'', [[2000-09-05]]]</ref>

The aircraft was completely destroyed in the impact and the post-crash fire, making the investigation difficult. The [[Australian Transport Safety Bureau]] (ATSB) and [[coroner]] investigating the crash concluded that depressurization was likely the cause of incapacitation, but were unable to conclusively rule out the presence of toxic fumes, possibly from the air conditioning system.<ref name="atsb"/><ref name="abc-aus1">[http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s674866.htm Ian Townsend, "Coroner critises NTSB following plane crash", ''ABC-PM'',[[2002-09-12]]]</ref><ref name="abc-aus2"/><ref>[http://www.ferret.com.au/articles/1c/0c00571c.asp "New theory on mining aircraft crash", ''Ferret.com.au'', [[2001-07-04]]]</ref> The ATSB recommended that a depressurization warning system be installed in other aircraft, but the [[Civil Aviation Safety Authority]] (CASA) declined to make such a change mandatory, evoking criticism in the media. The incident became known in the media as the "Ghost Flight".<ref name="abc-aus2"/>
