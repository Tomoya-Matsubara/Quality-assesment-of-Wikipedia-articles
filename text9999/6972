'''Ulum<U+0101>heihei Hoapili''' (c. 1776<U+2013>1840) was a member of the nobility during the formation of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. He was a trusted military and political advisor to King [[Kamehameha I]], known as "Kamehameha the Great". Although trusted with one of the last symbolic rites of the [[Hawaiian religion]], he later became a supporter of [[Christian]] missionaries.

==Life==
Ulum<U+0101>heihei (his original name) was born around 1776. His father was [[Kameeiamoku|High Chief Kame{{okina}}eiamoku]], known as one of the "royal twins" who helped [[Kamehameha I]] come to power.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.royalark.net/Hawaii/kauai.htm |title= Kauai Genealogy |author=Christopher Buyers |accessdate=2009-12-03 |work= Royal Ark web site }}</ref>
In his youth he was athletic, standing about {{convert|6.5|ft}} tall. A story was told of how he once wrestled down an attacking bull by its horns.<ref name="kamakau"/>{{rp|352}}
A few years after the 1795 [[battle of Nuuanu|battle of Nu{{okina}}uanu]] when Kamehameha conquered O{{okina}}ahu and Maui, Hoapili was left in charge of the island of [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]] and the royal court settled at [[Kamakahonu]] in present-day [[Kailua-Kona]]. 
His first marriage was to Chiefess Kalilikauoha (daughter of [[Kahekili II|King Kahekili]] of [[Maui]]). From her his daughter [[Kuini Liliha]] was born around 1802, about the same time his father Kame{{okina}}eiamoku died.<ref>{{cite web | title= Ulumaheihei Hoapili, (k) |work= Our Family History and Ancestry |publisher= Families of Old Hawaii |url= http://anonui.net/getperson.php?personID=I3886&tree=Ano |accessdate=2009-12-03 }}</ref>
In 1810 the King of the island of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] agreed to become a [[vassal]], and Kamehameha had united all the [[Hawaiian islands]].

By 1815, Kamehameha had established succession with two sons, and entrusted Ulum<U+0101>heihei with the care of their mother [[Keopuolani|Queen Ke<U+014D>p<U+016B>olani]], Kamehameha's wife with the best royal family background. This made Hoapili step-father to [[Nahienaena|Princess N<U+0101>hi{{okina}}ena{{okina}}ena]].<ref name=malo2008>{{cite web |url= http://hdl.handle.net/10524/588 |title= Davida Malo's Unpublished Account of Ke<U+014D>p<U+016B>olani |work= Hawaiian Journal of History |publisher=Hawaii Historical Society |volume=42  |author= Charles Langlas and Jeffrey Lyon |date= 2008 |pages=27<U+2013>48 |accessdate=2009-12-04 }}</ref>
He became known as ''hoa pili'' which means "close personal friend" in the [[Hawaiian language]] because of his trusted relationship with Kamehameha.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://wehewehe.org/gsdl2.5/cgi-bin/hdict?e=q&a=q&l=en&q=hoa%20pili |title=lookup of hoa pili |work= on Hawaiian dictionary |author= Pukui and Elbert |year=2003 |publisher= Ulukau, the Hawaiian Electronic Library, University of Hawaii |accessdate=2009-11-30 }}</ref>
A saying of the time was ''O Ulu-maheihei wale no, ia ia oloko, ia ia owaho'', meaning roughly "Ulum<U+0101>heihei knows everything inside and out."<ref name="kamakau">{{cite book |url= http://www.ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?c=chiefs&l=en |title= Ruling chiefs of Hawaii |author= [[Samuel Kamakau]] |year= 1991 |edition=Revised |publisher= [[Kamehameha Schools]] Press |location= Honolulu |isbn= 0-87336-014-1 }}</ref>{{rp|353}}

Hoapili was with Kamehameha when he died on May 8, 1819 at Kamakahonu. The dying king whispered his last wishes into Hoapili's ear.<ref name="bingham"/>{{rp|71}}
He and his half-brother [[Hoolulu|Ho{{okina}}olulu]] were selected to hide the bones of Kamehameha in a secret place, according to ancient rituals.<ref>{{cite book |title= Kamehameha and his warrior Kek<U+016B>haupi{{okina}}o |url=http://ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?e=q-0elibrary-000Sec--11en-50-20&a=d&d=D0.23.11&toc=0 |publisher= Ulukau, the Hawaiian Electronic Library, University of Hawaii.

To add to the secrecy, they waited for a night of a new moon. Theories are a cave was found along the shore that was covered at high tides, in the area known as [[Honokohau Settlement and Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park|Kaloko]].<ref name="worlds">{{cite web |author= William John Kaihe{{okina}}ekai Mai{{okina}}oho |url= http://www.pacificworlds.com/nuuanu/memories/memory1.cfm |title=Nu{{okina}}uanu, O{{okina}}ahu - Memories: Mauna {{okina}}Ala |year=2003 |publisher=Pacific Worlds & Associates |accessdate=2009-12-08 }}</ref>
This would be the last [[monarch]] of Hawaii to have all the traditional funeral rites of the [[Hawaiian religion]].

When his nephew [[Keaoua Kekuaokalani]] organized an uprising, Hoapili was sent with chief orator [[Naihe]] to negotiate a peaceful settlement. Kekuaokalani refused, so Hoapii and military leader [[Kalanimoku]] led Kingdom troops to the [[Kuamoo Burials|battle of Kuamo{{okina}}o]] where the rebels were routed.<ref name="bingham">{{cite book |author=[[Hiram Bingham I]] |title=A Residence of Twenty-one Years in the Sandwich Islands |publisher=H.D.

Another brief uprising in the northern part of the island near [[Waimea, Hawaii County, Hawaii|Waimea]] also had to be suppressed with troops lead by Hoapili.<ref name="bingham"/>{{rp|77}}

In 1820 the first company of Christian missionaries arrived. Although [[Kamehameha II]] was officially King, real power was held by his half-cousin [[Kaahumanu|Queen Ka{{okina}}ahumanu]] who welcomed them.
On April 11, 1822, some translators from [[Tahiti]] arrived with English missionary [[William Ellis (missionary)|William Ellis]]. The Hawaiian language was close enough to Tahitian that the pace of education improved.
In February 1823, Ke<U+014D>p<U+016B>olani renounced the practice of multiple spouses for royalty, and made Hoapili her only husband. Previously she had been "shared" with another former Kamehameha military leader, [[Kalanimoku|Kalanim<U+014D>k<U+016B>]]. 
On April 23, 1823, William Richards and Charles Stewart would arrive in the second company of missionaries and teach reading and writing.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://hdl.handle.net/10524/371 |title= The Sacred Wife of Kamehameha I: Ke<U+014D>p<U+016B>olani |work= Hawaiian Journal of History |publisher=Hawaii Historical Society |volume=5 |author= Marjorie Sinclair |date= 1971 |pages= 3-23 |accessdate=2009-12-04 }}</ref>

Hoapili served as Royal [[Governor of Maui]] from May 1823 until his death. In March he and Ke<U+014D>p<U+016B>olani moved to [[Lahaina]], and asked for books and a chaplain so they could continue their studies.<ref name=esther>{{cite journal |url= http://hdl.handle.net/10524/569  |title= Ke<U+014D>p<U+016B>olani: Sacred Wife, Queen Mother, 1778-1823 |work= Hawaiian Journal of History |publisher=Hawaii Historical Society |volume=32  |author= Esther Mookini |date= 1998 |pages=1-24 |accessdate=2009-12-04 }}</ref>
Ke<U+014D>p<U+016B>olani died September 16, 1823 after being a [[baptism]] by Ellis.

On October 19, 1823 Hoapili married [[Kalakua Kaheiheimaile|Kal<U+0101>kua Kaheiheim<U+0101>lie]] (c. 1780<U+2013>1842) who became known as "Hoapili-wahine", roughly meaning "Mrs. Hoapili". It was the first Christian weding ceremony for Hawaiian nobility.<ref name="marry"/> Hoapili would then often be known as "Hoapili-kane" ("Mr. Hoapili") to distinguish the two. This made him step-father to [[Kaahumanu III|Miriam Auhea Kek<U+0101>uluohi]], who was Queen Consort of two kings and mother of another.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalark.net/Hawaii/maui.htm |title=Maui Genealogy |author=Christopher Buyers |accessdate=2009-11-02 |work= The Royal Ark web site }}</ref>
They adopted and helped raise [[Kamehameha V|Prince Lot Kapu<U+0101>iwa]] (Kal<U+0101>kua's grandson, who would later be known as King Kamehameha V) in the Hawaiian tradition known as ''hanai''.<ref name="dibble">{{cite book |author= [[Sheldon Dibble]] |title = History of the Sandwich Isles |publisher = Press of the Mission Seminary |date = 1843 |location = Lahainaluna |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=EwqpkYKuXSMC }}</ref>{{rp|292}}

In August 1824, he led troops from Maui to supress an uprising by [[Humehume|"George Prince" Kaumuali{{okina}}i]] on [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]].<ref name="bingham"/>{{rp|238}}
During the 1820s, Lahaina became a popular port for [[whaling]] ships. This led to conflicts between the sailors who liked to enjoy their time ashore with grog and women, and the conservative missionaries. Hoapili ordered cannon to defend the town after an irate captain of the English whaler ''John Palmer'' had opened fire on the mission station.<ref name="rufus"/>{{rp|74}}

By 1826, he ruled that all marriages on Maui should follow the Christian tradition.<ref name="marry">{{cite web |url= http://hdl.handle.net/10524/375 |title= To Marry Again  |work= Hawaiian Journal of History |publisher=Hawaii Historical Society |volume=17 |author= Jane L.

After the thatched house used as a church blew down, in 1828 he ordered the first stone church to be built adjacent to [[Mokuula|Moku{{okina}}ula]] which was a royal residence and burial site on a small island within a sacred pond.<ref name="dr">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RZQcAAAAMAAJ |title=Dr. Baldwin of Lahaina |author=Mary Charlotte Alexander |publisher=M.C.

His daughter [[Kuini Liliha]] married [[Boki (Hawaiian chief)|High Chief Boki]], and inherited Boki's position of [[Governor of Oahu|Royal Governor of O{{okina}}ahu]] after Boki's disappearance at sea in 1829. Liliha was suspected of organizing a rebellion in 1830, and Hoapili was sent to peacefully relieve her of her duties.
In 1831 he donated land to be used for the Lanhainaluna seminary founded by [[Lorrin Andrews]]. This school would produce some of the important historians of the time, such as [[Samuel Kamakau]] and [[David Malo]]. Hoapili was consulted as an expert in astronomy and ancient [[Hawaiian mythology]] for the first book published on Hawaiian history. 
Hoapili selected a promising assistant to become educated as a teacher for [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i island]].<ref name="dibble"/>{{rp|246}}

As more companies of missionaries arrived, Hoapili awarded additional grants of land, sometimes to the consternation of the people who lived there.
[[Dwight Baldwin (missionary)|Dwight Baldwin]] arrived in 1836, and would help Hoapili deal with the health problems of [[alcoholism]] and epidemic diseases carried on the whaling ships.<ref name="dr"/>
Hoapili died January 3, 1840, and was buried at [[Waiola Church]] cemetery, then known as "Waine{{okina}}e Church".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=8137164 |title=Ulumaheihei Hoapili |work=Find A Grave web site |accessdate=2009-10-27 }}</ref>

==Legacy==
The Girls' dormitory at [[Lahainaluna High School]] (at the site of the Lanhainaluna seminary) was named for him.<ref>{{cite news |title= Traditions endure at Lahainaluna: David Malo Day, the Boarding Department and graduation are treasured institutions |date= April 29, 2002 |newspaper= [[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |url= http://archives.starbulletin.com/2002/04/29/features/story3.html |accessdate=2009-12-02 |author= Joruel Espiritu }}</ref>
The area where he lived on O{{okina}}ahu was given to his daughter Liliha and son-in-law Boki.
