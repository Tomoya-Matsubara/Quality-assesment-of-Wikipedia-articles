[[knighthood|Sir]] '''John Vanbrugh''' ([[January 24]] [[1664]]?&ndash;[[March 26]] [[1726]]) was an [[England|English]] [[architect]] and [[dramatist]], perhaps best known as the designer of [[Blenheim Palace]]. He wrote two argumentative and outspoken [[Restoration comedy|Restoration comedies]], ''[[The Relapse]]'' (1696) and ''[[The Provoked Wife]]'' (1697), which have become enduring stage favourites but  originally occasioned much controversy.

Vanbrugh was in many senses a radical throughout his life. As a young man and a committed [[British Whig Party|Whig]], he was part of the scheme to overthrow [[James II of England|James II]], put [[William III of England|William III]] on the throne and protect English [[parliamentary democracy]], dangerous undertakings which landed him in the dreaded [[Bastille]] of [[Paris]] as a [[political prisoner]]. In his career as a [[playwright]], he offended many sections of [[English Restoration|Restoration]] and 18th-century society, not only by the sexual explicitness of his plays, but also by their messages in defence of [[feminism|women's rights]] in marriage. He was attacked on both counts, and was one of the prime targets of [[Jeremy Collier]]'s ''[[Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage]]''. In his [[architecture|architectural]] career, he created what came to be known as [[English Baroque]]. His architectural work was as bold and daring as his early political activism and marriage-themed plays, and jarred [[conservatism|conservative]] opinions on the subject.

==Early life==

Vanbrugh was born in [[London]], and grew up in [[Chester]], where the family had been driven by the major outbreak of the [[Great Plague of London|plague]] in London in 1665.<ref>1. Vanbrugh's family background and youth, before he became a public figure, have been relayed down the centuries as hearsay and anecdote. Kerry Downes has shown in his well-researched modern biography (1987) that even the ''[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]'' and the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' repeat 18th- and 19th century traditions which were originally offered as guesses but have hardened into "fact" in the process of being passed on. This accounts for several discrepancies between the entries in these encyclop<U+00E6>dias and the following narrative, which is based on the findings of Downes (1987) and McCormick (1991).</ref> Downes is sceptical of earlier historians' claims of a lower [[middle class|middle-class]] background, and shows that an 18th-century suggestion that his father Giles Vanbrugh "may have been a sugar-baker" has been misunderstood. "[[Sugar-baker]]" implies wealth, as the term refers not to a [[confectionery|maker of sweets]] but to an owner of a sugar house, a factory for the refining of raw [[sugar]] from the [[Barbados]]. Sugar refining would normally be combined with sugar trading, which was a lucrative business. Downes' example of one sugar baker's house in [[Liverpool]] being estimated to bring in [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]40,000 a year in trade from the Barbados throws a different light on Vanbrugh's social background than the picture of a backstreet Chester sweetshop which is painted by [[Leigh Hunt]] in 1840 and reflected in many later accounts.

How Vanbrugh spent the years from age 18 to 22 (after leaving school) is something of a mystery. There are no records of him between 1682 and 1686, or any shred of evidence for the persistent story that he was studying (sometimes specifically architecture) in [[France]] (stated as fact in the ''Dictionary of National Biography''). As Laurence Whistler pointed out more than 60 years ago<!--- better to have a year here, I think <U+2014> agreed, I just don't know it, I'll try to find out [Bishonen]--->, there would have been no need for a young man of talent to go to France from England to study architecture. Moreover, the early drawings for [[Castle Howard]] show that he still drew like a novice in 1700, while the first thing he would have learned in a French architect's office would have been to set out a drawing properly.

The picture of a well-connected youth is reinforced by the fact that Vanbrugh in 1686 took up an officer's commission in his distant relative the [[Theophilus Hastings, 7th Earl of Huntingdon|Earl of Huntingdon]]'s regiment. Since commissions were in the gift of the commanding officer, Vanbrugh's entry as an officer shows that he did have the kind of upscale family network that was then essential to a young man starting out in life. 

It is worth noting, however, that in spite of the distant noble relatives and the sugar trade, Vanbrugh never in later life possessed any capital for business ventures such as the [[Haymarket Theatre]], but always had to rely on loans and backers. The fact that Giles Vanbrugh had twelve children to support and set up in life may go some way towards explaining the debts that were to plague John all his life.

==Political activism and the Bastille==
[[Image:Bastille2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The infamous French state prison the [[Bastille]], where Vanbrugh was incarcerated.]] From 1686, Vanbrugh was working undercover, playing a role in bringing about the armed invasion by [[William III of England|William of Orange]], the deposition of [[James II of England|James II]], and the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1689. He thus demonstrates an intense early identification with the Whig cause of [[parliamentary democracy]], with which he was to remain affiliated all his life. Returning from bringing William messages at [[The Hague]], Vanbrugh was arrested at [[Calais]] on a charge of [[espionage]] (which Downes concludes was trumped-up) in September 1688, two months before William invaded England. Vanbrugh remained in prison in France for four and a half years, part of the time in the Bastille, before being released in exchange for a French political prisoner. His life is sharply bisected by this prison experience, which he entered at age 24 and emerged from at 29, after having spent, as Downes puts it, half his adult life in captivity. It seems to have left him with a lasting distaste for the French political system but also with a taste for the comic dramatists and the architecture of France. 

The often-repeated claim that Vanbrugh wrote part of his comedy ''The Provoked Wife'' in the Bastille is based on allusions in a couple of much later memoirs and is regarded with some doubt by modern scholars (see McCormick). After being released from the Bastille, he had to spend three months in Paris, free to move around but unable to leave the country, and with every opportunity to see an architecture "unparalleled in England for scale, ostentation, richness, taste and sophistication" (Downes 75). He was allowed to return to England in 1693, and took part in a naval battle against the French in [[Camaret Bay]] in 1694. At some point in the mid-1690s, it is not known exactly when, he exchanged army life for London and the London stage.

==Public life==
===London===
Vanbrugh's London career was diverse and varied, comprising playwriting, architectural design, and attempts to combine these two overarching interests. For a chronological overview of his overlapping achievements and business ventures, which were sometimes confusing even to Vanbrugh himself. 

====The Kit-Cat Club====
Vanbrugh was a committed Whig and member of the Whig [[Kit-Cat Club]] &mdash; indeed being regarded as its most popular and beloved member &mdash; in line with the charm of personality and talent for friendship which his contemporaries mention over and over again. The Club is best known today as an early 18th-century social gathering point for culturally and politically prominent Whigs, including many artists and writers ([[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]], [[Joseph Addison]], [[Godfrey Kneller]]) and [[Politics of the United Kingdom|politicians]] (the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]], [[Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset|Charles Seymour]], the [[Charles Boyle, 2nd Earl of Burlington|Earl of Burlington]], [[Thomas Pelham-Holles]], [[Robert Walpole|Sir Robert Walpole]]). 

Politically, the Club promoted the Whig objectives of a strong [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], a limited [[monarchy]], resistance to France, and the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] succession to the throne. Yet the Kit-Cats always presented their club as more a matter of dining and conviviality, and this reputation has been successfully relayed to posterity. Downes suggests, however, that the Club's origins go back to before the Glorious Revolution of 1689 and that its political importance was much greater before it went public in 1700, in calmer and more Whiggish times. Downes proposes a role for an early Kit-Cat grouping in the armed invasion by William of Orange and the Glorious Revolution. [[Horace Walpole]], son of Kit-Cat Sir Robert Walpole, claims that the respectable middle-aged Club members generally mentioned as "a set of wits" were originally "in reality the patriots that saved Britain", in other words were the active force behind the Glorious Revolution itself. Secret groups tend to be poorly documented, and this sketch of the pre-history of the Club cannot be proved. But as we have seen, young Vanbrugh was indeed back in 1688 part of a secret network working for William's invasion. If the roots of the Club go back that far, it is tempting to speculate that Vanbrugh in joining the club was not merely becoming one of a convivial London "set of wits" but was also linking up with old friends and co-conspirators. A hero of the cause who had done time in French prison for it could have been confident of a warm welcome.

====The Haymarket theatre====
[[Image:London Kings Theatre Haymarket.jpg|thumb|The Queen's Theatre]]
In 1703, Vanbrugh started buying land and signing backers for the construction of a new theatre in [[the Haymarket]], designed by himself and intended for the use of an actors' cooperative (see [[John Vanbrugh#The Provoked Wife|''The Provoked Wife'']] below) led by [[Thomas Betterton]]. Vanbrugh and his associate William Congreve hoped by this enterprise to improve the chances of legitimate theatre in London, which was under threat from more colourful types of entertainment such as [[opera]], [[juggling]], [[Pantomime (theatre)|pantomime]] (introduced by [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]]), animal acts, travelling dance troupes, and famous visiting [[Italy|Italian]] singers. They also hoped to make a profit, and Vanbrugh optimistically bought up the actors' company, making himself sole owner. He was now bound to pay salaries to the actors and, as it turned out, to manage the theatre, a notorious tightrope act for which he had no experience. The often repeated rumour that the acoustics of the building Vanbrugh had designed were bad is exaggerated (see Milhous), but the more practical Congreve had become anxious to extricate himself from the project, and Vanbrugh was left spreading himself extremely thin, running a theatre and simultaneously overseeing the building of Blenheim, a project which after June 1705 often took him out of town. 

Unsurprisingly under these circumstances, Vanbrugh's management of the Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket showed "numerous signs of confusion, inefficiency, missed opportunities, and bad judgment" (Milhous). Having burned his fingers on theatre management, Vanbrugh too extricated himself, expensively, by selling the business in 1708, though without ever collecting much of the putative price. He had put a lot of money, his own and borrowed, into the theatre company, which he was never to recover. It was noted as remarkable by contemporaries that he continued to pay the actors' salaries fully and promptly while they were working for him, just as he always paid the workmen he had hired for construction work; shirking such responsibilities was close to being standard practice in early 18th-century England. Vanbrugh himself never seems to have pursued those who owed him money, and throughout his life his finances can at best be described as precarious.

====Marriage and death====
In 1719, at [[Medieval churches of York#St Lawrence, Lawrence Street|St Lawrence Church, York]], Vanbrugh married Henrietta Maria Yarborough of [[Heslington Hall]], aged 26 to his 55. In spite of the age difference, this was by all accounts a happy marriage, which produced two sons. Unlike that of the [[rake]] heroes and [[fop]]s of his plays, Vanbrugh's personal life was without scandal.

Vanbrugh died "of an [[asthma]]" in 1726 in the modest town house designed by him in 1703 out of the ruins of [[Whitehall Palace]] and satirised by [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]] as "the goose pie". His married life, however, was mostly spent at [[Greenwich, London|Greenwich]] (then not considered part of London at all) in the house on Maze Hill now known as [[Vanbrugh Castle]], a miniature [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[tower house]] designed by Vanbrugh in the earliest stages of his career.

Vanbrugh arrived in London at a time of scandal and internal drama at London's only theatre company, as a long-running conflict between pinchpenny management and disgruntled actors came to a head and the actors walked out. A new comedy staged with the makeshift remainder of the company in January 1696, [[Colley Cibber]]'s ''Love's Last Shift'', had a final scene that to Vanbrugh's critical mind demanded a sequel, and he threw himself into the fray by providing it.

====''The Relapse''====
'''Cibber's ''Love's Last Shift''''' 

Colley Cibber's notorious tear-jerker ''Love's Last Shift, Or, Virtue Rewarded'' was written and staged in the eye of a theatrical storm. London's only and mismanaged theatre company, known as the United Company, had split in two in March 1695 when the senior actors began operating their own acting cooperative, and the next season was one of cutthroat rivalry between the two companies. 

Cibber, an inconspicuous young actor still employed by the parent company, seized this moment of unique demand for new plays and launched his career on two fronts by writing a play with a big, flamboyant part for himself: the Frenchified fop Sir Novelty Fashion. Backed up by Cibber's own uninhibited performance, Sir Novelty delighted the audiences. In the serious part of ''Love's Last Shift'', wifely patience is tried by an out-of-control [[rake|Restoration rake]] husband, and the perfect wife is celebrated and rewarded in a climactic finale where the cheating husband kneels to her and expresses the depth of his repentance. 

''Love's Last Shift'' has not been staged again since the early 18th century and is read only by the most dedicated scholars, who sometimes express distaste for its businesslike combination of four explicit acts of sex and rakishness with one of sententious reform (see Hume). If Cibber indeed was deliberately attempting to appeal simultaneously to rakish and respectable Londoners, it worked: the play was a great box-office hit.

'''Sequel: ''The Relapse'''''

Vanbrugh's witty sequel ''The Relapse, Or, Virtue in Danger'', offered to the United Company six weeks later, questions the justice of women's position in [[marriage]] at this time. He sends new sexual temptations in the way of not only the reformed husband but also the patient wife, and allows them to react in more credible and less predictable ways than in their original context, lending the flat characters from ''Love's Last Shift'' a dimension that at least some critics are willing to consider [[psychology|psychological]] (see Hume). 

In a [[trickster]] subplot, Vanbrugh provides the more traditional Restoration attraction of an overly well-dressed and exquisite fop, Lord Foppington, a brilliant re-creation of Cibber's Sir Novelty Fashion in ''Love's Last Shift'' (Sir Novelty has simply in ''The Relapse'' bought himself the title of "Lord Foppington" through the corrupt system of Royal title sales). Critics of Restoration comedy are unanimous in declaring Lord Foppington "the greatest of all Restoration fops" (Dobr<U+00E9>e), by virtue of being not merely laughably affected, but also "brutal, evil, and smart" (Hume).

''The Relapse'', however, came very close to not being performed at all. The United Company had lost all its senior performers, and had great difficulty in finding and keeping actors of sufficient skills for the large cast required by ''The Relapse''. Members of that cast had to be kept from defecting to the rival actors' cooperative, had to be "seduced" (as the legal term was) back when they did defect, and had to be blandished into attending rehearsals which dragged out into ten months and brought the company to the threshold of bankruptcy. "They have no company at all", reports a contemporary letter in November, "and unless a new play comes out on Saturday revives their reputation, they must break". That new play, ''The Relapse'', did turn out a tremendous success that saved the company, not least by virtue of Colley Cibber again bringing down the house with his second impersonation of Lord Foppington. "This play (the ''Relapse'')", writes Cibber in his autobiography forty years later, "from its new and easy Turn of Wit, had great Success".

====''The Provoked Wife''====
Vanbrugh's second original comedy, ''The Provoked Wife'', followed soon after, performed by the rebel actors' company. This play is different in tone from the largely farcical ''The Relapse'', and adapted to the greater acting skills of the rebels. Vanbrugh had good reason to offer his second play to the new company, which had got off to a brilliant start by premi<U+00E8>ring Congreve's ''[[Love For Love]]'', the greatest London box-office success for years. The actors' cooperative boasted the established star performers of the age, and Vanbrugh tailored ''The Provoked Wife'' to their specialties. While ''The Relapse'' had been robustly phrased to be suitable for amateurs and minor acting talents, he could count on versatile professionals like Thomas Betterton, [[Elizabeth Barry]], and the rising young star [[Anne Bracegirdle]] to do justice to characters of depth and nuance. 

''The Provoked Wife'' is a comedy, but Elizabeth Barry who played the abused wife was especially famous as a tragic actress, and for her power of "moving the passions", i.e., moving an audience to pity and tears. Barry and the younger Bracegirdle had often worked together as a tragic/comic heroine pair to bring audiences the typically tragic/comic rollercoaster experience of Restoration plays. Vanbrugh takes advantage of this schema and these actresses to deepen audience sympathy for the unhappily married Lady Brute, even as she fires off her witty ripostes. In the intimate conversational dialogue between Lady Brute and her niece Bellinda (Bracegirdle), and especially in the star part of Sir John Brute the brutish husband (Betterton), which was hailed as one of the peaks of Thomas Betterton's remarkable career, ''The Provoked Wife'' is something as unusual as a Restoration [[problem play]]. The premise of the plot, that a wife trapped in an abusive marriage might consider either leaving it or taking a lover, outraged some sections of Restoration society.

====Changing audience taste====
In 1698, Vanbrugh's argumentative and sexually frank plays were singled out for special attention by [[Jeremy Collier]] in his ''[[Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage]]'', particularly for their failure to impose exemplary morality by appropriate rewards and punishments in the fifth act. Vanbrugh laughed at these charges and published a joking reply, where he accused the clergyman Collier of being more sensitive to unflattering portrayals of the clergy than to real irreligion. However, rising public opinion was already on Collier's side. The intellectual and sexually explicit [[Restoration comedy]] style was becoming less and less acceptable to audiences and was soon to be replaced by a drama of sententious morality. Colley Cibber's ''Love's Last Shift'', with its reformed rake and sentimental reconciliation scene, can be seen as a forerunner of this drama. 

Although Vanbrugh continued to work for the stage in many ways, he produced no more original plays. With the change in audience taste away from Restoration comedy, he turned his creative energies from original composition to dramatic adaptation/translation, theatre management, and architecture.

===Architect===
As an architect (or surveyor, as the term then was) Vanbrugh is thought to have had no formal training (compare [[John Vanbrugh#Early life|Early life]] above). His inexperience was compensated by his unerring eye for [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] and detail and his close working relationship with [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]]. Hawksmoor, a former clerk of Sir [[Christopher Wren]], was to be Vanbrugh's collaborator in many of his most ambitious projects, including Castle Howard and Blenheim. During his almost thirty years as a practising architect Vanbrugh designed and worked on numerous buildings. More often than not his work was a rebuild or remodel, such as that at [[Kimbolton Castle]], where Vanbrugh had to follow the instructions of his patron. Consequently these houses, which often claim Vanbrugh as their architect, do not typify Vanbrugh's own architectural concepts and ideas.

Though Vanbrugh is best known in connection with stately houses, the parlous state of London's 18th-century streets did not escape his attention. In the ''[[London Journal]]'' of [[March 16]], [[1722]]&ndash;23, [[James Boswell]] comments:

:"We are informed that Sir John Vanbrugh, in his scheme for new paving the cities of London and Westminster, among other things, proposes a tax on all gentlemen's coaches, to stop all channels in the s"eet, and to carry all the water off by drains and common sewers under ground.''

Vanbrugh's chosen style was [[Baroque architecture|baroque]], which had been spreading across Europe during the 17th century promoted by, among others, [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] and [[Louis Le Vau|Le Vau]]. The first baroque country house built in England was [[Chatsworth House]] designed by [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]] three years before Castle Howard. In the race for the commission of Castle Howard, the untrained and untried Vanbrugh astonishingly managed to out-charm and out-clubman the professional but less socially adept Talman and to persuade the [[Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle|Earl of Carlisle]] to give the great opportunity to him instead (see Downes, 193&ndash;204). Seizing it, Vanbrugh instigated European baroque's metamorphosis into a subtle, almost understated version that became known as English baroque. Three of Vanbrugh's designs act as milestones for evaluating this process:-
# [[Castle Howard]], commissioned in 1699;
# [[Blenheim Palace]], commissioned in 1704; 
# [[Seaton Delaval Hall]], begun in 1718.

Work in progress on each of these projects overlapped into the next, providing a natural progression of thoughts and style.

====Castle Howard====
{{main|Castle Howard}}
[[Image:Castle_Howard.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Vanbrugh's south [[facade]] of [[Castle Howard]].]]
[[Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle]], a fellow member of the Kit-Cat Club, commissioned Vanbrugh in 1699 to design his [[mansion]], often described as England's first truly baroque building. The baroque style at Castle Howard is the most European that Vanbrugh ever used. 

Castle Howard, with its immense corridors in segmental [[colonnade]]s leading from the main entrance block to the flanking wings, its centre crowned by a great domed tower complete with [[cupola]], is very much in the school of classic European baroque. It combined aspects of design that had only appeared occasionally, if at all, in English architecture: [[John Webb]]'s Greenwich Palace, Wren's unexecuted design for Greenwich, which like Castle Howard was dominated by a domed centre block, and of course Talman's Chatsworth. A possible inspiration for Castle Howard was also [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]] in [[France]].

The interiors are extremely dramatic, the Great Hall rising 80&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (24&nbsp;[[metre|m]]) into the cupola. [[Scagliola]], and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian columns]] abound, and galleries linked by soaring arches give the impression of an opera stage-set &mdash; doubtless the intention of the architect.

Castle Howard was acclaimed a success. This fantastical building, unparalleled in England, with its facades and roofs decorated by pilasters, statuary, and flowing ornamental carving, ensured that baroque became an overnight success. While the greater part of Castle Howard was inhabited and completed by 1709, the finishing touches were to continue for much of Vanbrugh's lifetime. The west wing was finally completed after Vanbrugh's death.

The acclaim of the work at Castle Howard led to Vanbrugh's most famous commission, architect for Blenheim Palace.

====Blenheim Palace====
{{main|Blenheim Palace}}
[[Image:Blenheim Palace Terrace.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The West facade of [[Blenheim Palace]] (''"Vanbrugh's castle air"'') shows the unique severe towering stone [[belvedere (structure)|belvedere]]s ornamenting the skyline.]]

The [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]]'s forces defeated King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s army at [[Blenheim]], a village on the [[Danube]] in 1704. Marlborough's reward, from a grateful nation, was to be a splendid country seat, and the Duke himself chose fellow Kit-Cat John Vanbrugh to be the architect. Work began on the palace in 1705. 

Blenheim Palace was conceived to be not only a grand [[country house]], but a national monument. Consequently, the light baroque style used at Castle Howard would have been unsuitable for what is in effect a [[war memorial]]. The house had to display strength and military glory. It is in truth more of a [[castle]], or [[citadel]], than a [[palace]]. The qualities of the building are best illustrated by the massive East Gate (''illustration, below, left''), set in the [[curtain wall]] of the service block, which resembles an impregnable entrance to a walled city. Few realise it also serves as [[water tower]] for the palace, thus confounding those of Vanbrugh's critics who accused him of impracticability.

[[Image:Blenheim East Gate.gif|thumb|left|150px|Vanbrugh's monumental East Gate at [[Blenheim Palace]] is more the entrance to a [[citadel]] than to a [[palace]]. Vanbrugh cunningly slightly tapered the sides to create an illusion of even greater height and drama.]]

Blenheim, the largest non-royal domestic building in England, consists of three blocks, the centre containing the living and [[state room]]s, and two flanking rectangular wings both built around a central [[courtyard]]: one contains the [[stable]]s, and the other the [[kitchen]]s, [[laundry|laundries]], and storehouses. If Castle Howard was the first truly baroque building in England, then Blenheim Palace is the most definitive. While Castle Howard is a dramatic assembly of restless masses, Blenheim is altogether of a more solid construction, relying on tall slender windows and monumental statuary on the roofs to lighten the mass of yellow stone. 

The suite of state rooms placed on the ''[[piano nobile]]'' were designed to be overpowering and magnificent displays, rather than warm, or comfortable. Cosy, [[middle class]] comfort was not the intention at [[Versailles]], the great palace of Marlborough's foe, and it was certainly not deemed a consideration in the palace built to house the conqueror of Versailles' master. 
 
[[Image:South portico.gif|thumb|right|200px|The pediment over the south portico is a complete break from the convention.  The flat top is decorated by a trophy bearing the marble bust of Louis XIV looted by [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Marlborough]] from [[Tournai]] in 1709, weighing 30 tons.  The positioning of the bust was an innovative new design in the decoration of a pediment.]]

As was common in the 18th century, personal comfort was sacrificed to perspective. Windows were to adorn the facades, as well as light the interior. Blenheim was designed as a theatre piece from the 67&nbsp;foot (20&nbsp;m) high great hall, leading to the huge [[fresco]]ed [[saloon]], all designed on an axis with the 134&nbsp;foot (41&nbsp;m) high column of victory in the grounds, with the trees planted in the battle positions of Marlborough's soldiers.  Over the south portico (''illustrated right''), itself a massive and dense construction of piers and columns, definitely not designed in the Palladian manner for elegant protection from the sun, a huge bust of Louis XIV is forced to look down on the splendours and rewards of his conqueror.  If this placement and design was an ornamental feature created by Vanbrugh, or an ironic joke by Marlborough, is not known.  However, as an architectural composition it is a unique example of baroque ornament.

At Blenheim, Vanbrugh developed baroque from the mere ornamental to a denser, more solid, form, where the massed stone became the ornament. The great arched gates and the huge solid portico were ornament in themselves, and the whole mass was considered rather than each facade.

====Seaton Delaval Hall====
{{main|Seaton Delaval Hall}}
[[Image:Seaton_Delaval_Hall_-_main_block_from_N.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Seaton Delaval Hall]] &ndash; [[corps de logis]] viewed from the north]]

[[Seaton Delaval Hall]] was Vanbrugh's final work, this northern, seemingly rather bleak country house is considered his finest architectural masterpiece (see all architectural references below). The reasons for this are not immediately apparent to the viewer; by this stage in his architectural career Vanbrugh was a master of baroque, he had taken this form of architecture way beyond the almost flamboyant continental baroque of Castle Howard, past the more severe but still decorated Blenheim, to a point of pure sophistication. Vulgar [[ornament]] was almost disguised: a recess or a pillar was not placed for support, but to create a play of light or shadow. The [[silhouette]] of the building was of equal, if not greater, importance with the plan of rooms. In every aspect of the house, subtlety was the keyword; this is the secret of Seaton Delaval. 

Built between 1718 and 1728 for Admiral George Delaval, it replaced the existing house on the site. It is possible that the design of Seaton Delaval was influenced by [[Palladio]]'s [[Villa Foscari]] (sometimes known as "La Malcontenta"), built circa 1555. Both have [[rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] facades and similar [[demilune]] windows over a non-porticoed entrance. Even the large [[attic]] [[gable]] at Villa Foscari hints at the [[clerestory]] of Seaton's great hall. 

The design concept Vanbrugh drew up was similar to that employed at Castle Howard and Blenheim: a centre block between two arcaded and pedimented wings. However, Seaton Delaval was to be on a much smaller scale. Work began in 1718 and continued for ten years. The building is an advancement on the style of Blenheim, rather than the earlier castle Howard. The principal block, or [[corps de logis]],  containing, as at Blenheim and Castle Howard, the principal state and living room, forms the centre of a three-sided court. Towers crowned by [[balustrade]]s and [[pinnacle]]s give the house something of what Vanbrugh called his castle air. 

Seaton Delaval is one of the few houses Vanbrugh designed alone without the aid of Nicholas Hawksmoor. The sobriety of their joint work has sometimes been attributed to Hawksmoor, and yet Seaton Delaval is a very sombre house indeed. Whereas Castle Howard could successfully be set down in [[Dresden]] or [[W<U+00FC>rzburg]], Seaton Delaval firmly belongs in [[Northumberland]] and in that landscape. Vanbrugh, in the final stage in his career, was fully liberated from the rules of the architects of a generation earlier. The rustic stonework is used for the entire facade, including on the entrance facade, the pairs of twin columns supporting little more than a stone [[cornice (architecture)|cornice]]. The twin columns are severe and utilitarian, and yet ornament, as they provide no structural use. This is part of the furtive quality of the baroque of Seaton Delaval: the ornamental appears as a display of strength and mass. 

The likewise severe, but perfectly proportioned, garden facade has at its centre a four columned, [[balcony]]-roofed portico. Here the slight fluting of the stone columns seems almost excessive ornament. As at Blenheim, the central block is dominated by the raised clerestory of the great hall, adding to the drama of the building's silhouette, but unlike Vanbrugh's other great houses, no statuary decorates the roof-scape here. The decoration is provided solely by a simple balustrade hiding the roof line, and chimneys disguised as [[finial]]s to the balustrading of the low towers. Vanbrugh was now truly a master of the baroque. The massing of the stone, the [[colonnade]]s of the flanking wings, the heavy stonework and intricate recesses all create light and shade which is ornament in itself.

Only Vanbrugh could have taken for his inspiration one of Palladio's masterpieces, and while retaining the humanist values of the building, alter and adapt it, into an unrivalled form of subtle, sophisticated baroque unseen elsewhere in Europe. English baroque had arrived.

====Architectural reputation====
Vanbrugh's prompt success as an architect can be attributed to his friendships with the influential of the day. No less than five of his architectural patrons were fellow members of the Kit-cat club. In 1702, through the influence of Charles Howard, Earl of Carlisle, Vanbrugh was appointed [[comptroller]] of the [[Royal Works]] (now the Board of Works, where several of his designs may still be seen). In 1703, he was appointed commissioner of [[Greenwich Hospital]], which was under construction at this time, and succeeded Wren as the official architect (or Surveyor), while Hawksmoor was appointed Site Architect. Vanbrugh's small but conspicuous final changes to the nearly completed building were considered a fine interpretation of Wren's original plans and intentions. Thus what was intended as an infirmary and hostel for destitute retired sailors was transformed into a magnificent national monument. His work here is said to have impressed both [[Queen Anne of England|Queen Anne]] and her government, and is directly responsible for his subsequent success.

Vanbrugh's reputation still suffers from accusations of extravagance, impracticability and a bombastic imposition of his own will on his clients. Ironically, all of these unfounded charges derive from Blenheim &mdash; Vanbrugh's selection as architect of Blenheim was never completely popular. The Duchess, the formidable [[Sarah Churchill]], particularly wanted Sir [[Christopher Wren]]. However, eventually a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] signed by the [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Earl of Godolphin]], the parliamentary treasurer, appointed Vanbrugh, and outlined his remit. Sadly, nowhere did this warrant mention Queen, or Crown. This error provided the [[get-out clause]] for the state when the costs and political infighting escalated.

[[Image:Blenheim Palace. Great Court.gif|thumb|right|300px|[[Blenheim Palace]] The great court, and state entrance to the palace. The Duchess of Marlborough felt the building was extravagant.]] 

Though Parliament had voted funds for the building of Blenheim, no exact sum had ever been fixed upon, and certainly no provision had been made for inflation. Almost from the outset, funds had been intermittent. Queen Anne paid some of them, but with growing reluctance and lapses, following her frequent altercations with her one time best friend, Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough. After the Duchess's final argument with the Queen in 1712, all state money ceased and work came to a halt. <U+00A3>220,000 had already been spent and <U+00A3>45,000 was owing to workmen. The Marlboroughs went into exile on the continent, and did not return until after Queen Anne's death in 1714.

The day after the Queen's death the Marlboroughs returned, and were reinstated in favour at the court of the new King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]]. The 64-year-old Duke now decided to complete the project at his own expense; in 1716 work re-started and Vanbrugh was left to rely entirely upon the means of the Duke of Marlborough himself. Already discouraged and upset by the reception the palace was receiving from the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] factions, the final blow for Vanbrugh came when the Duke was incapacitated in 1717 by a severe stroke, and the thrifty (and hostile) Duchess took control. The Duchess blamed Vanbrugh entirely for the growing extravagance of the palace, and its general design: that her husband and government had approved them, she discounted. (In fairness to her, it must be mentioned that the Duke of Marlborough had contributed <U+00A3>60,000 to the initial cost, which, supplemented by Parliament, should have built a monumental house.) Following a meeting with the Duchess, Vanbrugh left the building site in a rage, insisting that the new masons, carpenters and craftsmen were inferior to those he had employed. The master craftsmen he had patronised, however, such as [[Grinling Gibbons]], refused to work for the lower rates paid by the Marlboroughs. The craftsmen brought in by the Duchess, under the guidance of furniture designer [[James Moore]], completed the work in perfect imitation of the greater masters, so perhaps there was fault and intransigence on both sides in this famed argument.

Vanbrugh was deeply distressed by the turn of events. The rows and resulting rumours had damaged his reputation, and the palace he had nurtured like a child was forbidden to him. In 1719, while the duchess was "not at home", Vanbrugh was able to view the palace in secret; but when he and his wife, with the Earl of Carlisle, visited the completed Blenheim as members of the viewing public in 1725, they were refused admission to even enter the park. The palace had been completed by [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]]. 

That Vanbrugh's work at Blenheim has been the subject of criticism can largely be blamed on those, including the Duchess, who failed to understand the chief reason for its construction: to celebrate a martial triumph. In the achievement of this remit, Vanbrugh was as triumphant as was Marlborough on the field of battle.

== Legacy ==
Vanbrugh is remembered today for his vast contribution to British culture, theatre, and architecture. An immediate dramatic legacy was found among his papers after his sudden death, the three-act comedy fragment ''A Journey to London''. Vanbrugh had told his old friend Colley Cibber that he intended in this play to question traditional marriage roles even more radically than in the plays of his youth, and end it with a marriage falling irreconcilably apart. The unfinished manuscript, today available in Vanbrugh's ''Collected Works'', depicts a country family travelling to London and falling prey to its [[sharper]]s and temptations, while a London wife drives her patient husband to despair with her [[gambling]] and her consorting with the demi-monde of [[confidence trick|con men]] and half-pay officers. As with ''The Relapse'' at the outset of Vanbrugh's dramatic career, Colley Cibber again became involved, and this time he had last word. Cibber, now [[poet laureate]] and successful actor-manager, completed Vanbrugh's manuscript under the title of ''The Provoked Husband'' (1728) and gave it a happy and sententious ending in which the provocative wife repents and is reconciled: a [[eulogy]] of marriage which was the opposite of Vanbrugh's declared intention to end his last and belated "Restoration comedy" with marital break-up. Cibber considered this projected outcome to be "too severe for Comedy", and such severity was in fact rarely to be seen on the English stage before [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]].

Sir John Brute in ''The Provoked Wife'' became one of [[David Garrick]]'s most famous roles.]]

On the 18th-century stage, Vanbrugh's ''Relapse'' and ''Provoked Wife'' were only considered possible to perform in bowdlerised versions, but as such, they remained popular. Throughout Colley Cibber's long and successful acting career, audiences continued to demand to see him as Lord Foppington in ''The Relapse'', while Sir John Brute in ''The Provoked Wife'' became, after being an iconic role for Thomas Betterton, one of [[David Garrick]]'s most famous roles. In the present day, ''The Relapse'', now again to be seen uncut, remains a favourite play.

With the completion of Castle Howard English baroque came into fashion overnight. It had brought together the isolated and varied instances of monumental design, by, among others, Inigo Jones and Christopher Wren. Vanbrugh thought of masses, volume and perspective in a way that his predecessors had not.

He also had the unusual skill, for an architect, of delivering the goods that his clients required. His reputation has suffered because of his famed disagreements with the Duchess of Marlborough, yet, one must remember his original client was the British Nation, not the Duchess, and the nation wanted a monument and celebration of victory, and that is what Vanbrugh gave the nation.

His influence on successive architects is incalculable. Nicholas Hawksmoor, Vanbrugh's friend and collaborator on so many projects continued to design many London churches for ten years after Vanbrugh's death. Vanbrugh's pupil and cousin the architect [[Edward Lovett Pearce]] rose to become one of [[Ireland]]'s greatest architects.

Vanbrugh is remembered throughout Britain, by inns, street names, a university college ([[Vanbrugh College (University of York)|York]]) and schools named in his honour, but one only has to wander through London, or the English country-side dotted with their innumerable country houses, to see the ever present influence of his architecture.
