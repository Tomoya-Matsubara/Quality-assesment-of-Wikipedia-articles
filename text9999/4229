'''''Rostislav''''' was a [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] built by the [[Black Sea Shipyard|Nikolaev Admiralty]] in the 1890s for the [[Black Sea Fleet]] of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]]. She was conceived as a small, inexpensive [[coastal defence ship]], but the Navy abandoned the concept in favour of a compact seagoing battleship with a displacement of {{Convert|8880|LT|t|lk=on}}. Overloading caused by poor design and construction practices increased her actual displacement by more than {{Convert|10000|LT|t|lk=on|abbr=on}}. ''Rostislav'' became the world's first capital ship to burn [[fuel oil]], rather than coal.<ref name=W57>Willmott, p. 57.</ref> Her combat ability was compromised by the use of {{convert|10|in|adj=on|0}} main guns instead of the [[de facto]] Russian standard of {{convert|12|in|0}}.

Her hull was launched in September 1896, but non-delivery of the ship's main guns delayed her [[maiden voyage]] until 1899 and her completion until 1900. In May 1899 ''Rostislav'' became the first ship of the Imperial Navy to be commanded by a member of the [[House of Romanov]], Captain [[Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia|Alexander Mikhailovich]].<ref name=R12>Melnikov, p. 12.</ref> From 1903 to 1912 ''Rostislav'' was the [[flagship|junior flagship]] of the Black Sea Fleet. During the [[1905 Russian Revolution]] her crew was on the verge of mutiny but remained loyal to the regime and actively suppressed the [[mutiny]] of the cruiser {{ship|Russian cruiser|Ochakov||2}}.

''Rostislav'' was actively engaged in [[World War I]] until the collapse of the Black Sea Fleet in the beginning of 1918. She was the first Russian ship to open fire against enemy targets on land during World War I, the first Russian ship to be hit by a German [[airstrike]], and the first one to destroy a submarine, albeit [[Karp class submarine|a Russian one]]. In April 1918 the fleeing [[Bolshevik]]s abandoned ''Rostislav'' in [[Sevastopol]]. One year later the British occupation forces permanently disabled her engines. The [[White movement|White forces]] reused the ship as a towed floating battery and scuttled her in the [[Strait of Kerch]] in November 1920.

==Design and description==

''Rostislav'' was conceived in 1892 as a cheap and compact platform for 12-inch guns, similar in size to earlier [[coastal defence ship]]s, but possessing proper seagoing capabilities for operations in the Black Sea. Admiral [[Nikolay Chikhachov]], Chief of the Ministry of the Navy, envisioned that a squadron of such ships, each displacing four to five thousand tonnes, that would fit into his total desired displacement target of {{convert|24000|LT|t|lk=on}}. Chief designer of the [[Black Sea Shipyard|Nikolaev Admiralty Shipyard]], [[Sergey Ratnik]],<ref>In the very beginning of 1893 Ratnik moved from Nikolaev to Saint Petersburg and became chief executive of privately-owned [[Baltic Shipyard]]. - Melnikov, p. 4.</ref> evaluated Chikhachov's request for proposals, and advised against the idea in general. The Naval Technical Committee (NTC) concurred: any meaningful combination of fire power, armour, speed and stability required at least {{convert|6000|LT|t}}. The NTC discarded Ratnik's advice to build an improved copy of the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Sissoi Veliky||2}} of {{convert|8880|LT|t}}, but did not present a definite alternative. The NTC declined to discuss tactical matters, leaving the choice of armament to Chikhachov.<ref name=R4>Melnikov, p. 4.</ref>

Chikhachov, appalled by the bureaucratic games of his staff, instructed [[Andrey Toropov]] of Nikolaev Admiralty to draft two proposals, one armed with 10-inch and the other with 12-inch guns.<ref name=R5>Melnikov, p. 5.</ref> Toropov estimated that the ship should have displaced at least {{convert|8880|LT|t}}.<ref name=R5/> Chikhachov admitted the fact and presented the two options to the NTC. The admiral himself and the active fleet commanders voted for the 12-inch calibre, which had already become a worldwide battleship standard, but the NTC strongly advised against it.<ref name=R5/> The Navy [[Official|brass]] spent April and May 1893 in lengthy debates. They agreed to increase displacement to 8,880 tons and were leaning towards accepting 12-inch guns when [[General Admiral]] [[Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Alexey]] resolved the discussion in favor of the smaller calibre.<ref name=R8>Melnikov, p. 8.</ref>

''Rostislav''{{'}}s hull was a carbon copy of ''Sissoi Veliky'', protected with newly developed [[Harvey armour]]. She was also the first Russian battleship to use electric power to [[wikt:train|train]] her guns, instead of older hydraulic systems.<ref name=R9/>

===General characteristics===
''Rostislav'' was {{convert|345|ft|6|in|1}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|351|ft|10|in|1}} long [[length overall|overall]]. She had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|68|ft|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|25|ft|2|in|1}}. She displaced  {{convert|10520|LT|t|lk=on}}, over {{convert|1500|LT|t|abbr=on}} more than her designed displacement of {{convert|8880|LT|t|abbr=on}}.<ref name=m72>McLaughlin, p. 93.</ref> This weight gain increased her draft by about {{convert|3|ft|1}}, which submerged most, if not all, of her [[waterline]] armored belt.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 96.</ref>

===Propulsion===
''Rostislav'' had two [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple expansion steam engines]], identical to those of ''Sissoi Veliky'', that had a total designed output of {{convert|8500|ihp|lk=on}}. Eight cylindrical [[fire-tube boiler]]s, four singled-ended and four double-ended, provided steam to the engines, each of which drove one [[propeller]]. Half of the boilers were coal-fired and the other half were oil-fired,<ref name=m97/> making ''Rostislav'' the first major warship in the world to use fuel oil.<ref>Silverstone, p. 366.</ref> On [[sea trial]]s, the power plant produced a total of {{convert|8816|ihp|lk=on}} and a top speed of {{convert|15.8|kn|lk=on}}. She carried a maximum of {{convert|820|LT|MT}} of fuel oil and coal at full load that provided a range of {{convert|3100|nmi|lk=on}} at a speed of {{convert|8|kn}}.<ref name=m97>McLaughlin, pp. 93, 97.</ref>

===Armament===
The main armament consisted of two pairs of {{convert|10|in|mm|0|adj=on}} 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] Model 1891 guns mounted in French-style centre-pivot twin [[gun turret]]s fore and aft. Each turret had an arc of fire of 240<U+00B0>.<ref name=m57>McLaughlin, p. 95.</ref> These guns had a maximum elevation of 15<U+00B0> and could depress to <U+2212>5<U+00B0>. 80 rounds per gun were carried. They fired a {{convert|496.5|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2273|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Maximum range was {{convert|18412|yd|m}} at an elevation of 35<U+00B0>, although ''Rostislav'''s guns had a maximum elevation of less than half that.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNRussian_10-45_m1891.htm|title=Russian 10"/45 (25.4 cm) Pattern 1891|date=5 December 2006|publisher=Navweps.com |accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref>

All eight of the 6-inch [[Canet guns|Canet Pattern]] Pattern 1892 45-calibre guns were mounted in [[turret]]s on the main deck. Each turret was positioned at a corner of the superstructure and had an arc of fire of 110<U+00B0>.<ref name=m57/> The guns could elevate to a maximum of 20<U+00B0> and depress to <U+2212>6<U+00B0>. Each gun was provided with 180 rounds. They fired shells that weighed {{convert|91.27|lb|kg|abbr=on}} with a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2600|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. They had a maximum range of {{convert|12600|yd|m}} when fired at maximum elevation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNRussian_6-45_m1892.htm|title=Russian 6"/45 (15.2 cm) Pattern 1892 152 mm/45 (6") Pattern 1892|date=12 January 2009|publisher=Navweaps.com |accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref>

The anti-[[torpedo boat]] armament consisted of twelve {{convert|47|mm|in|adj=on}} [[Hotchkiss gun]]s. Eight of these were mounted in the superstructure and the locations of the remaining four are unclear.<ref name=m57/> They fired a {{convert|3.3|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1476|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of 20 rounds per minute to a range of {{convert|2020|yd|m}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNRussian_47mm_Hotchkiss.htm|title=Russia 47 mm/5 (1.85") Hotchkiss gun 47 mm/1 (1.85") Hotchkiss gun [3-pdr (1.4 kg) Hotchkiss guns] |date=1 December 2006|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref> The ship also mounted sixteen {{convert|37|mm|in|adj=on}} Hotchkiss guns, eight of which were carried in the [[Top (sailing ship)|fighting top]]. The locations of the other eight are unknown.<ref name=m57/> They fired a {{convert|1.1|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1450|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of 20 rounds per minute. Their maximum range was {{convert|3038|yd|m}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNRussian_37mm_Hotchkiss.htm|title=Russia 37 mm/5 (1.5") Hotchkiss Gun 37 mm/1 (1.5") Hotchkiss Gun [1-pdr (0.45 kg) Hotchkiss Guns] |date=1 December 2006|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

''Rostislav'' carried six {{convert|15|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s. Four were above water, one each in the bow and stern and the aft pair of [[broadside]] tubes. The forward broadside tubes were underwater. The ship carried 50 [[Naval mine|mines]] to be used to protect her anchorage.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 95<U+2013>96.</ref>

===Protection===
''Rostislav'' used [[Harvey armour]]. The maximum thickness of the [[Belt armor|waterline belt]] was {{convert|14.5|in|mm|0}} which reduced to {{convert|10|in|mm|0}} abreast the [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s. It covered {{convert|227|ft|m|1}} of the ship's length and was {{convert|7|ft|1}} high. While the exact height of the belt above the designed waterline is unknown, much of it, if not not all, would have been below the waterline as the ship's draught was over {{convert|3|ft|1}} deeper than designed. The belt terminated forward in a {{convert|9|in|mm|0|adj=on}} transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] and aft in a {{convert|5|in|mm|0|adj=on}} bulkhead. The upper belt was 5&nbsp;inches thick, {{convert|7|ft|6|in|m|1}} high and covered {{convert|160|ft|m|1}} of the ship's side. The sides of the main gun turrets were 10&nbsp;inches thick and they had {{convert|2.5|in|mm|0|adj=on}} roofs. The sides of the 6-inch turrets were 6&nbsp;inches thick as were the side of the [[conning tower]]. The armour [[deck (ship)|deck]] was flat and located at the upper edge of the main belt. It was {{convert|2|in|0}} thick. Below the waterline, forward and aft of the [[armoured citadel]] were {{convert|3|in|mm|0|adj=on}} decks.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 96<U+2013>97.</ref>

==Construction==

The law obliged the U.S. Navy to purchase only U.S.-made steel, thus eliminating competitive choices open to other navies. As a result, the U.S. Navy paid $660 a ton when foreign governments paid only $300. - ''[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C04E1D6143BEE33A2575BC2A9629C94679ED7CF Serving Two Masters: Naval Officers Employed by Armor Plate Makers]''. The New York Times, April 28, 1896.</ref>

''Rostislav''{{'}}s hull was launched on {{OldStyleDateNY|September 2|August 20}}, 1896. Lack of proper cranes in [[Mykolaiv|Nikolaev]] turned the installation of its engines into an engineering nightmare, and the Navy even considered towing the hull to [[Sevastopol]] for completion. The Nikolaev engineers eventually resolved the problem and the ship was ready to sail in July 1897. ''Rostislav'' conducted her [[sea trial|speed trials]] held on {{OldStyleDateNY|October 21|October 8}}, 1898, still missing her main guns. Her power plant performed flawlessly, but also became a statement of the designers' incompetence as its weight exceeded the design target by more than {{convert|300|t|LT}}.<ref name=R10>Melnikov, p. 10.</ref>

Non-delivery of the new 10-inch Model 1897 guns, made by the [[Obukhov State Plant|Obukhov Factory]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] for ''Rostislav'', {{sclass|Admiral Ushakov|coast defense ship}}s and {{sclass|Peresvet|battleship}}s, delayed the completion of ''Rostislav'' by two years.<ref name=R10/> One of these guns, earmarked for ''Admiral Ushakov'', burst at the proving ground and the whole batch was subjected to exhaustive tests and, when possible, repairs. Guns number 16 to 19 passed the tests and were delivered to Sevastopol in July<U+2013>August 1899. ''Rostislav'' was able to sail for her first gunnery trial on {{OldStyleDateNY|April 12|March 30}}, 1900.<ref name=R11>Melnikov, p. 11.</ref> On the second day of shooting practice the [[shock absorber|recoil mechanism]]s of her forward turret failed and more defects were discovered back at the base. ''Rostislav'' spent the rest of the spring having her gun mounts repaired,<ref name=R12>Melnikov, p. 12.</ref> but the problem persisted and the Navy "solved" it by prohibiting them from being used.<ref name=R13/> The gun mounts were rebuilt along the pattern of those used by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{ship|Russian armoured cruiser|Admiral Nakhimov||2}} in 1901<U+2013>1902; ''Rostislav'' successfully passed the gunnery tests in June 1902.<ref name=R13/> The commission noted that her electrical turret controls were unnecessarily complex. Their 332 [[Electrical connector|contact pairs]] required tedious maintenance and they were too complex for most of the enlisted men.<ref name=R14>Melnikov, p. 14.</ref>

==Service==
===Junior flagship===
On {{OldStyleDateNY|May 1|May 14}}, 1899 [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia|Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich]] assumed command of ''Rostislav'', becoming the first [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] since [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] to actually command a combat ship.<ref name=R12/> Another Romanov, [[Cyril Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia|Grand Duke Kirill]], spent a few uneventful months on board of ''Rostislav'' in 1900.<ref name=R13>Melnikov, p. 13.</ref> Alexander's guests, parties and diplomatic visits to [[Istanbul]] regularly interfered into daily service of the crew.<ref name=R12/> On the other hand, Alexander wisely limited such occasions to a reasonable minimum, and personally managed the repairs and alterations of ''Rostislav''<U+2032>s equipment.<ref name=R12/> Shipyards and contractors treated ''Rostislav'' as a priority customer. Alexander, based on his experience with [[Russian battleship Sissoi Veliky|''Sisoy Veliky'']], persuaded the NTC to reinforce ''Rostislav''<U+2032>s rudder frame and supervised installation of a backup control post deep under the [[conning tower]].<ref name=R12/> In 1903 Alexander was promoted to [[rear admiral]] and returned to his ship as a squadron commander.<ref name=R17>Melnikov, p. 17.</ref> ''Rostislav'' served as the junior flagship of the Black Sea Fleet until September 1912.<ref name=R28>Melnikov, p. 28.</ref>

The 1900 season revealed grave problems with ''Rostislav''<U+2032>s boilers. Black smoke from burning oil turned out more conspicuous than ordinary coal smoke.<ref name=R14/> Uneven distribution of heat inside the boilers caused severe local overheating, buckling of [[Firebox (steam engine)|fireboxes]] and sudden [[backdraft]]s.<ref name=R14/> In three and a half months the boilers failed one by one, starting with small auxiliary power units and ending with the main boilers.<ref name=R14/> Oil delivered by the [[Rothschild family|Rothschild-controlled]] Russian Standard Oil was not at fault; similar problems were experienced by oil-fired ships of the [[Baltic Fleet]].<ref>Melnikov, pp. 17<U+2013>18.</ref>
Repairs and alterations of the power plant continued until 1904, when the continuing boiler failures compelled the Navy to dispense with oil fuel and ''Rostislav'' was converted to coal in 1904<U+2013>1905.<ref name=R21>Melnikov, p. 21.</ref> Each round of repairs and alterations added more weight to the already overloaded ship, and by 1907 the ship's [[belt armor]] was completely below the waterline.<ref name=R22/>

On {{OldStyleDate|June 27|1905|June 14}}, the day of the [[Russian battleship Potemkin|battleship ''Potemkin'' mutiny]] ''Rostislav'' was sailing under the ensign of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Alexander Krieger]].<ref name=R21/> [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] ordered Krieger and his superior, fleet commander [[Grigory Chukhnin]], to destroy the rebels by force, but the admirals wisely refrained from a shooting battle. They let the rebels flee to [[Odessa]] and later to [[Romania]]. Krieger's own crew was on the verge of open mutiny.<ref name=R22>Melnikov, p. 22.</ref> On July 2, 1905 a military council held on board ''Rostislav'' decided to moor the ships in Odessa, disconnect the engines from the propellers and let the enlisted men walk ashore at will.<ref>''[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D0CE1DA173DE733A25750C0A9619C946497D6CF Black Sea Fleet to be Disbanded]''. The New York Times, July 3, 1905.</ref> By the time of the [[Russian cruiser Ochakov|''Ochakov'' mutiny]] in November 1905, fleet morale had improved and Krieger did not hesitate to fire two 10-inch and fourteen 6-inch shells against the rebels.<ref name=R22/>

===Exercises and casualties===
After the [[Battle of Tsushima]] the Imperial Navy concentrated on improving their gunnery skills and fire-control practices.<ref name=R234>Melnikov, pp. 23<U+2013>24.</ref> In 1908 [[Alexei Krylov]] and [[Yevgeny Berkalov]] led ''Rostislav'' on an unprecedented long-range gunnery shoot: ''Rostislav'' fired 330 10-inch shells at a distance of eight to ten miles in a few days.<ref name=R234/> The experiment proved that the older [[Range of a projectile|ballistic tables]] used by the Navy were highly inaccurate. Berkalov compiled the data from the 1908 exercise into the new tables adopted by the Navy.<ref name=R234/> Another of Krylov's initiatives, rapid [[Glossary_of_nautical_terms#C|counter-flooding]], was standardised in 1909.<ref name=R28>Melnikov, p. 28.</ref>

Two plans for modernizing the ship were put forward before World War I. In 1907 the [[Naval General Staff]] proposed a major reconstruction aimed at reducing her displacement and raising her armour belt higher out of the water. Her above-water torpedo tubes, [[torpedo net]]s auxiliary boilers and 47-millimetre guns would be removed, her superstructure cut down and her rigging reduced to a single pole mast. These changes would reduce her displacement by {{convert|250|LT|t}}, but the plan was rejected due to a shortage of money.<ref name=M88>McLaughlin, p. 288.</ref> Her above-water torpedo tubes, however, were removed about the same time.<ref name=m94>McLaughlin, p. 294.</ref> In 1912 the staff of the Black Sea Fleet proposed to replace all of her 47&nbsp;mm guns with four {{convert|75|mm|0|adj=on}} guns and to removed the auxiliary boilers and the submerged torpedo tubes to offset the additional weight. The Naval General Staff did not think that this was worth the cost and rejected the plan.<ref name=M88/> Even though these plans did not come to fruition, other alterations were made to ''Rostislav'' before the war. A dozen of her 37&nbsp;mm guns were removed in 1906 and she was fitted with {{convert|15|ft|1|adj=on}} [[rangefinder]]s, probably from [[Barr and Stroud]], in 1907<U+2013>08.<ref name=m94/>

In 1909<U+2013>10 ''Rostislav'' and the rest of Black Sea Fleet was prepared for joint operations with [[submarine]]s. She was scheduled to equipped with the first Russian [[underwater acoustic communication]] system; the installation was interrupted and her hardware was installed on the battleship [[Russian battleship Potemkin|''Panteleimon'']] (the former ''Potemkin'') instead.<ref>Godin and Palmer, p. 33.</ref> During the anti-submarine exercise held on the night of June 11<U+2013>12 <small>(O.S.

===Diplomatic incidents===

Before the outbreak of World War I ''Rostislav'' was involved in two minor international incidents. On {{OldStyleDate|August 11|1911|July 29}} two of the Black Sea Fleet battleships paying a state visit to [[Romania]] ran aground on a [[shoal]] just off the port of [[Constan<U+0163>a]]. ''Rostislav''{{'}}s officers detected the hazard and steered her to safety, but did nothing to alert {{ship|Russian battleship|Evstafi||2}} and ''Panteleimon''.<ref name=R28>Melnikov, p. 28.</ref> The international embarrassment led to the resignation of fleet commander Admiral [[Ivan Bostrem]].<ref name=R28/> During the [[First Balkan War]] ''Rostislav'' sailed into the [[Sea of Marmara]] to protect the Russian Embassy from the mob of [[Istanbul]].<ref name=R29>The international "observation fleet" comprised 21 ship, including ''Rostislav'', ''[[SMS Goeben|Goeben]]'' and ''[[French armoured cruiser L<U+00E9>on Gambetta|L<U+00E9>on Gambetta]]''. - Melnikov, p. 29.</ref> Here she created another diplomatic incident by accidentally firing a live shell into the Turkish defenses. No one was injured and the captain defused the conflict with a personal apology to the Ottoman government.<ref name=R293>Melnikov, p. 29<U+2013>30.</ref>

===World War I===
{{further|[[SMS Goeben]], [[Caucasus Campaign]], [[Romania during World War I]]}}

''Rostislav'' spent the winter of 1913<U+2013>14 refitting, in April 1914 she returned to the active fleet with newly overhauled machinery, new rangefinders and gun sights.<ref name=R31>Melnikov, p. 31.</ref> The ship made {{convert|15.37|kn}} on her post-refit trials.<ref name=m94/>

On {{OldStyleDateNY|November 4|October 22}}, 1914 the Black Sea Fleet sailed out on its first combat operation of the war<U+2013>the bombardment of [[Zonguldak]]. The operation was conceived as a retaliation against the [[SMS_Goeben#1914|Turkish-German attack on Sevastopol]]. ''Rostislav'', captained by [[Kazimierz Por<U+0119>bski]], was the "designated [[gunboat]]" while other Russian battleships formed a defensive screen around her. On {{OldStyleDateNY|November 6|October 24}} ''Rostislav'' fired 251 shells at the port of Zonguldak reducing it to rubble.<ref name=R32>Melnikov, p. 32.</ref> On {{OldStyleDateNY|November 18|November 5}} ''Rostislav'' faced ''Goeben'' during the [[Battle of Cape Sarych]], but the German ship broke contact before ''Rostislav'', trailing behind the Russian formation, even spotted her.<ref name=R34>Melnikov, p. 34.</ref> ''Rostislav'' had other encounters with ''Goeben'' in 1915 and 1916, but did not engage her directly.<ref>Admiral [[Andrei Eberhardt]] deliberately kept ''Rostislav'' out of action to protect the old ship from a vastly superior enemy. He reasoned that a ship with 10-inch guns had no place in a fight of 12-inch guns (as had already been proven by the loss of [[SMS Bl<U+00FC>cher]] in the Battle of Dogger Bank in 1915). - Melnikov, pp. 35<U+2013>36.</ref> In 1915 the ship received four 75&nbsp;mm [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] guns.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 310.</ref>

After the commissioning of the {{sclass|Imperatritsa Mariya|battleship|0}} dreadnoughts, the old battleships were split into independent combat groups. ''Rostislav'' became the flagship of the [[Batumi]] Group tasked with supporting the ground operations of the [[Russian Caucasus Army|Caucasus Army]].<ref name="R37">Melnikov, p. 36.</ref> Their first joint action began February 5, 1916 near [[Arhavi]].<ref name=W305/> On the first day alone ''Rostislav'' fired four hundred shells against the Turks.<ref name=R37>Melnikov, p. 36.</ref> On March 4 ''Rostislav'', and the gunboats ''Kubanetz'' and ''Donetz'' supported the amphibious landing at [[Pazar|Atina]].<ref name=W305>Willmott, p. 305.</ref> Three days later ''Rostislav'' supported the landing of marines that ended in the capture of [[Rize]]. At the end of March ''Rostislav'' and ''Panteleimon'' forced the Turks to evacuate [[Trabzon]].<ref name=R37/>

In the summer of 1916 the Navy seriously considered an all-out amphibious assault of the [[Bosphorus]].<ref name=R39>Melnikov, p. 39.</ref> Fleet commander [[Andrei Eberhardt]] anticipated high risk of naval mine and torpedo hits in the coastal waters and suggested equipping all pre-dreadnought battleships with [[anti-torpedo bulge]]s. {{ship|Russian battleship|Sinop||2}} had her bulges fitted in Nikolaev in July 1916, ''Rostislav'' was next in line, but the work was cancelled in August.<ref name=R40>Melnikov, p. 40.</ref> Instead of a proper refit ''Rostislav'' was transferred to the Romanian coast as flagship of the Constanta Group. [[Constan<U+0163>a]] temporarily became an important logistical hub for the Russian troops heading to the Romanian Front, and the base for minelayers, submarines and destroyers harassing the enemy in the Bosphorus area. The Germans responded with air raids; their first aerial success against a Russian naval target was scored against ''Rostislav''. The bomb hit the edge of the aft 10-inch turret and injured sixteen sailors. The turret itself remained fully operational. The [[Romania_during_World_War_I#The_counteroffensive_of_the_Central_Powers_.28September-December_1916.29|collapse of the Romanian Front]] in October 1916 forced the Navy to evacuate Constan<U+0163>a. ''Rostislav'' returned to [[Sevastopol]] for a much-needed overhaul.<ref name=R38>Melnikov, p. 38.</ref>

===Revolution===
{{further|[[Russian Revolution (1917)]], [[Russian Civil War]], [[Entente intervention in the Russian Civil War]]}}

The [[February Revolution]] of 1917 did not demoralize the Black Sea Fleet as quickly as the Baltic Fleet. Captain Fyodor Stark (1876<U+2013>1939), a former destroyer commander, maintained ''Rostislav'' in combat-ready condition until the end of the year.<ref name=R41>Melnikov, p. 41.</ref> The battleship sailed out for her last voyage to Batumi in September-October. Stark managed to contain radical politics, [[anti-German sentiment]] and [[Ukrainization]] of the crew, but nevertheless raised the [[flag of Ukraine]] on his return to Sevastopol on {{OldStyleDateNY|October 25|October 12}}.<ref>Melnikov, pp. 41 and 42.</ref> From this moment desertion and "volunteering" into the [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guards]] intensified and by {{OldStyleDateNY|December 21|December 8}} the crew was reduced to 460 enlisted men and 28 officers.<ref name=R42>Melnikov, p. 42.</ref> In January 1918 the fleet disintegrated completely: the officers fled from the enraged enlisted men, while the enlisted men abandoned the ships and fled from the advancing German Army.<ref name=R44>Melnikov, p. 44.</ref> On April 29, 1918 the [[Bolshevik]]s managed to extricate two battleships and sixteen destroyers from Sevastopol to [[Novorossiysk]], but ''Rostislav'' and the rest of the fleet remained in Sevastopol.

German occupation of [[Crimea]] in May<U+2013>November 1918 did not affect the abandoned ship. The Anglo-French forces that replaced the Germans stayed in Sevastopol until April 1919.<ref name=R46>Melnikov, p. 46.</ref> Before leaving the British blew up ''Rostislav''{{'}}s engines on April 25. The [[White movement|White forces]] of [[Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel|Baron Wrangel]] used the disabled ''Rostislav'' as a [[floating battery]] in the [[Sea of Azov]].<ref>McLaughlin, p. 99.</ref> The ship, manned by a ragtag volunteer crew, was stationed in the shallow waters of the [[Strait of Kerch]] to harass the Reds in [[Taman, Russia|Taman]] and prevent a landing in the Crimea.<ref name=R47/> After the defeat of Wrangel's land forces, the crew [[Scuttling|scuttled]] ''Rostislav'' in the Strait of Kerch to prevent the Reds from breaking out into the Black Sea.<ref name=R47>Melnikov, p. 47.</ref>

''Rostislav'' sank to the shallow bottom, her superstructure remaining above water. In 1930 the [[EPRON]] salvaged ''Rostislav''<U+2032>s guns and partially dismantled the hull. According to diver Alexander Yolkin, the remains of the hull are still lying in the strait, around {{convert|1200|m|yd}} from the Ukrainian coast, and gradually sinking into the [[silt]].<ref>Yolkin, A.
