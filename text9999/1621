The '''Declaration of Independence''' was a statement adopted by the [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] on July 4, 1776, which announced that the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen American colonies]] then at war with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] regarded themselves as independent states, and no longer a part of the [[British Empire]]. Written primarily by [[Thomas Jefferson]], the Declaration was a formal explanation of why Congress had voted on July 2 to [[Lee Resolution|declare independence]] from Great Britain, more than a year after the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The birthday of the [[United States|United States of America]]<U+2014>[[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]]<U+2014>is celebrated on July 4, the day the wording of the Declaration was approved by Congress.

After finalizing the text on July 4, Congress issued the Declaration of Independence in several forms. It was initially published as a printed [[Dunlap broadside|broadside]] that was widely distributed and read to the public. The most famous version of the Declaration, a signed copy that is usually regarded as ''the'' Declaration of Independence, is on display at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Although the wording of the Declaration was approved on July 4, the date of its signing has been disputed. Most historians have concluded that it was signed nearly a month after its adoption, on August 2, 1776, and not on July 4 as is commonly believed.

The sources and interpretation of the Declaration have been the subject of much scholarly inquiry. The Declaration justified the independence of the United States by listing colonial grievances against [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], and by asserting certain [[natural and legal rights]], including a [[right of revolution]]. Having served its original purpose in announcing independence, the text of the Declaration was initially ignored after the [[American Revolution]]. Its stature grew over the years, particularly the second sentence, a sweeping statement of [[human rights]]:

<blockquote>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that [[all men are created equal]], that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are [[Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness|Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness]].</blockquote>

This sentence has been called "one of the best-known sentences in the English language"<ref>Lucas, "Justifying America", 85.</ref> and "the most potent and consequential words in American history".<ref>Ellis, ''American Creation'', 55<U+2013>56.</ref> The passage has often been used to promote the rights of marginalized people throughout the world, and came to represent a moral standard for which the United States should strive. This view was notably promoted by [[Abraham Lincoln]], who considered the Declaration to be the foundation of his political philosophy, and argued that the Declaration is a statement of principles through which the [[United States Constitution]] should be interpreted.<ref name="McPherson126">McPherson, ''Second American Revolution'', 126.</ref>

==Background==
[[Image:Thomas Jefferson rev.jpg|thumb|upright|Thomas Jefferson, the principal author of the Declaration]]

{{epigraph|quote=''Believe me, dear Sir: there is not in the British empire a man who more cordially loves a union with Great Britain than I do. But, by the God that made me, I will cease to exist before I yield to a connection on such terms as the British Parliament propose; and in this, I think I speak the sentiments of America.''|cite=Thomas Jefferson, November 29, 1775<ref>Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 19.</ref>}}

By the time the Declaration of Independence was adopted in July 1776, the Thirteen Colonies and Great Britain had been at war for more than a year. Relations between the colonies and the [[Motherland|mother country]] had been deteriorating since the end of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763. The war had plunged the British government deep into debt, and so [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] enacted a series of measures to increase tax revenue from the colonies. Parliament believed that these acts, such as the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] of 1765 and the [[Townshend Acts]] of 1767, were a legitimate means of having the colonies pay their fair share of the costs to keep the colonies in the [[British Empire]].<ref>Christie and Labaree, ''Empire or Independence'', 31.</ref>

Many colonists, however, had developed a different conception of the empire. Because the colonies were not directly represented in Parliament, colonists argued that Parliament had [[No taxation without representation|no right to levy taxes]] upon them. This tax dispute was part of a larger divergence between British and American interpretations of the [[British Constitution]] and the extent of Parliament's [[authority]] in the colonies.<ref>Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 162.</ref> The orthodox British view, dating from the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, was that Parliament was the [[Parliamentary sovereignty|supreme authority]] throughout the empire, and so by definition anything Parliament did was constitutional.<ref>Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 200<U+2013>02.</ref> In the colonies, however, the idea had developed that the British Constitution recognized certain [[natural and legal rights|fundamental rights]] that no government<U+2014>not even Parliament<U+2014>could violate.<ref>Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 180<U+2013>82.</ref> After the Townshend Acts, some essayists even began to question whether Parliament had any [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] jurisdiction in the colonies at all.<ref>Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 241.</ref> Anticipating the arrangement of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]],<ref>Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 224<U+2013>25.</ref> by 1774 American writers such as [[Samuel Adams]], [[James Wilson]], and Thomas Jefferson were arguing that Parliament was the legislature of Great Britain only, and that the colonies, which had their own legislatures, were connected to the rest of the empire only through their [[allegiance]] to [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|the Crown]].<ref>Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 241<U+2013>42. The writings in question include Wilson's ''Considerations on the Authority of Parliament'' and Jefferson's ''[[A Summary View of the Rights of British America]]'' (both 1774), as well as Samuel Adams's 1768 [[Massachusetts Circular Letter|Circular Letter]].</ref>

===Congress convenes===
The issue of Parliament's authority in the colonies became a crisis after Parliament passed the [[Coercive Acts]] in 1774 to punish the [[Province of Massachusetts]] for the [[Boston Tea Party]] of 1773. Many colonists saw the Coercive Acts as a violation of the British Constitution and thus a threat to the liberties of all of [[British America]]. In September 1774, the [[First Continental Congress]] convened in [[Philadelphia]] to coordinate a response. Congress organized a [[Continental Association|boycott of British goods]] and [[Petition to the King (1774)|petitioned the king]] for repeal of the acts. These measures were unsuccessful because [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and the [[Ministry (collective executive)|ministry]] of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] were determined not to retreat on the question of parliamentary supremacy. As the king wrote to North in November 1774, "blows must decide whether they are to be subject to this country or independent".<ref>Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 168; Ferling, ''Leap in the Dark'', 123<U+2013>24.</ref>

Even after fighting in the [[American Revolutionary War]] began at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]] in April 1775, most colonists still hoped for reconciliation with Great Britain.<ref>Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 13; Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 318.</ref> When the [[Second Continental Congress]] convened at the [[Independence Hall (United States)|Pennsylvania State House]] in Philadelphia in May 1775, some delegates hoped for eventual independence, but no one yet advocated declaring it.<ref>Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 318.</ref> Although many colonists no longer believed that Parliament had any sovereignty over them, they still professed loyalty to King George, who they hoped would intercede on their behalf. They were to be disappointed: in late 1775, the king rejected Congress's [[Olive Branch Petition|second petition]], issued a [[Proclamation of Rebellion]], and announced before Parliament on October 26 that he was even considering "friendly offers of foreign assistance" to suppress the rebellion.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 25. The text of the 1775 [[Speech from the Throne|king's speech]] is [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/rbpe:@field(DOCID+@lit(rbpe1440150a)) online], published by the [[American Memory]] project.</ref> A pro-American minority in Parliament warned that the government was driving the colonists toward independence.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 25.</ref>

==Toward independence==
In January 1776, just as it became clear in the colonies that the king was not inclined to act as a conciliator, [[Thomas Paine]]'s pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' was published.<ref>Rakove, ''Beginnings of National Politics'', 88<U+2013>90.</ref> Paine, who had only recently arrived in the colonies from England, argued in favor of colonial independence, advocating [[republicanism]] as an alternative to monarchy and hereditary rule.<ref>Christie and Labaree, ''Empire or Independence'', 270; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 31<U+2013>32.</ref> ''Common Sense'' introduced no new ideas,<ref>Jensen, ''Founding'', 667.</ref> and probably had little direct effect on [[Second Continental Congress|Congress]]'s thinking about independence; its importance was in stimulating public debate on a topic that few had previously dared to openly discuss.<ref>Rakove, ''Beginnings of National Politics'', 89; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 33.</ref> Public support for separation from Great Britain steadily increased after the publication of Paine's enormously popular pamphlet.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 33<U+2013>34.</ref>

[[Image:Independence Hall Assembly Room.jpg|thumb|left|The Assembly Room in Philadelphia's [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]], where the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence]]

Although some colonists still held out hope for reconciliation, developments in early 1776 further strengthened public support for independence. In February 1776, colonists learned of Parliament's passage of the [[Prohibitory Act]], which established a blockade of American ports and declared American ships to be enemy vessels. [[John Adams]], a strong supporter of independence, believed that Parliament had effectively declared American independence before Congress had been able to. Adams labeled the Prohibitory Act the "Act of Independency", calling it "a compleat <!-- sic --> Dismemberment of the British Empire".<ref>Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 209; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 25<U+2013>27.</ref> Support for declaring independence grew even more when it was confirmed that King George had hired German mercenaries to use against his American subjects.<ref>Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 67.</ref>

Despite this growing popular support for independence, Congress lacked the clear authority to declare it. Delegates had been elected to Congress by thirteen different governments<U+2014>which included extralegal conventions, ad hoc committees, and elected assemblies<U+2014>and were bound by the instructions given to them. Regardless of their personal opinions, delegates could not vote to declare independence unless their instructions permitted such an action.<ref>Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 77.</ref> Several colonies, in fact, expressly prohibited their delegates from taking any steps towards separation from Great Britain, while other delegations had instructions that were ambiguous on the issue.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 30.</ref> As public sentiment for separation from Great Britain grew, advocates of independence sought to have the Congressional instructions revised. For Congress to declare independence, a majority of delegations would need authorization to vote for independence, and at least one colonial government would need to specifically instruct (or grant permission for) its delegation to propose a declaration of independence in Congress. Between April and July 1776, a "complex political war"<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 59.</ref> was waged to bring this about.<ref>Jensen, ''Founding'', 671; Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 78.</ref>

===Revising instructions===
In the campaign to revise Congressional instructions, many Americans formally expressed their support for separation from Great Britain in what were effectively state and local declarations of independence. Historian [[Pauline Maier]] identified more than ninety such declarations that were issued throughout the Thirteen Colonies from April to July 1776.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 48, and Appendix A, which lists the state and local declarations.</ref> These "declarations" took a variety of forms. Some were formal, written instructions for Congressional delegations, such as the [[Halifax Resolves]] of April 12, with which North Carolina became the first colony to explicitly authorize its delegates to vote for independence.<ref>Jensen, ''Founding'', 678<U+2013>79.</ref> Others were legislative acts that officially ended British rule in individual colonies, such as on May 4, when the Rhode Island legislature became the first to declare its independence from Great Britain.<ref>Jensen, ''Founding'', 679; Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 92<U+2013>93.</ref> Many "declarations" were resolutions adopted at town or county meetings that offered support for independence. A few came in the form of jury instructions, such as the statement issued on April 23, 1776, by Chief Justice [[William Henry Drayton]] of South Carolina: "the law of the land authorizes me to declare...that ''George'' the Third, King of ''Great Britain''...has no authority over us, and we owe no obedience to him."<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 69<U+2013>72, quote on 72.</ref> Most of these declarations are now obscure, having been overshadowed by the declaration approved by Congress on July 4.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 48. The modern scholarly consensus is that the best-known and earliest of the local declarations, the [[Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence]], allegedly adopted in May 1775 (a full year before other local declarations), is most likely inauthentic; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 174.</ref>

Some colonies held back from endorsing independence. Resistance was centered in the [[middle colonies]] of New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Delaware.<ref name="Jensen, Founding, 682">Jensen, ''Founding'', 682.</ref> Advocates of independence saw Pennsylvania as the key: if that colony could be converted to the pro-independence cause, it was believed that the others would follow.<ref name="Jensen, Founding, 682"/> On May 1, however, opponents of independence retained control of the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly|Pennsylvania Assembly]] in a special election that had focused on the question of independence.<ref>Jensen, ''Founding'', 683.</ref> In response, on May 10 Congress passed a resolution, which had been promoted by John Adams and [[Richard Henry Lee]], calling on colonies without a "government sufficient to the [[wikt:exigency|exigencies]] of their affairs" to adopt new governments.<ref>Jensen, ''Founding'', 684; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 37. For the full text of the May 10 resolve see the [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc004109)): ''Journals of the Continental Congress''].</ref> The resolution passed unanimously, and was even supported by Pennsylvania's [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]], the leader of the anti-independence faction in Congress, who believed that it did not apply to his colony.<ref>Jensen, ''Founding'', 684.</ref>

===May 15 preamble===
{{quote box|align=right|width=33%|quote=''This Day the Congress has passed the most important Resolution, that ever was taken in America.''|source=John Adams, May 15, 1776<ref>Burnett, ''Continental Congress'', 159. The text of Adams's letter is [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(dg003624)):: online].</ref>}}

As was the custom, Congress appointed a committee to draft a [[preamble]] that would explain the purpose of the resolution. John Adams wrote the preamble, which stated that because King George had rejected reconciliation and was even hiring foreign mercenaries to use against the colonies, "it is necessary that the exercise of every kind of authority under the said crown should be totally suppressed".<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 37; Jensen, ''Founding'', 684. For the full text of the May 15 preamble see the [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc004113)) ''Journals of the Continental Congress''].</ref> Everyone understood that Adams's preamble was meant to encourage the overthrow of the governments of Pennsylvania and Maryland, which were still under [[proprietary colony|proprietary]] governance.<ref>Rakove, ''National Politics'', 96; Jensen, ''Founding'', 684; Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 94.</ref> Congress passed the preamble on May 15 after several days of debate, but four of the middle colonies voted against it, and the Maryland delegation walked out in protest.<ref>Rakove, ''National Politics'', 97; Jensen, ''Founding'', 685.</ref> Adams regarded his May 15 preamble as effectively an American declaration of independence, although he knew that a formal declaration would still have to be made.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 38.</ref>

===Lee's resolution and the final push===
On the same day that Congress passed Adams's radical preamble, the [[Virginia Conventions|Virginia Convention]] set the stage for a formal Congressional declaration of independence. On May 15, the Convention instructed Virginia's congressional delegation "to propose to that respectable body to declare the United Colonies free and independent States, absolved from all allegiance to, or dependence upon, the Crown or Parliament of Great Britain".<ref>Boyd, ''Evolution'', 18; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 63. The text of the May 15 Virginia resolution is [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/const/const02.htm online] at Yale Law School's Avalon Project.</ref> In accordance with those instructions, Richard Henry Lee of Virginia presented a [[Lee Resolution|three-part resolution]] to Congress on June 7. The motion, which was seconded by John Adams, called on Congress to declare independence, form foreign alliances, and prepare a plan of colonial confederation. The part of the resolution relating to declaring independence read:

<blockquote>Resolved, that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 41; Boyd, ''Evolution'', 19.</ref></blockquote>

Lee's resolution met with resistance in the ensuing debate. Opponents of the resolution, while conceding that reconciliation with Great Britain was unlikely, argued that declaring independence was premature, and that securing foreign aid should take priority.<ref>Jensen, ''Founding'', 689<U+2013>90; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 42.</ref> Advocates of the resolution countered that foreign governments would not intervene in an internal British struggle, and so a formal declaration of independence was needed before foreign aid was possible. All Congress needed to do, they insisted, was to "declare a fact which already exists".<ref>Jensen, ''Founding'', 689; Armitage, ''Global History'', 33<U+2013>34. The quote is from Jefferson's notes; Boyd, ''Papers of Jefferson'', 1:311.</ref> Delegates from Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and New York were still not yet authorized to vote for independence, however, and some of them threatened to leave Congress if the resolution were adopted. Congress therefore voted on June 10 to postpone further discussion of Lee's resolution for three weeks.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 42<U+2013>43; Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 106.</ref> Until then, Congress decided that a committee should prepare a document announcing and explaining independence in the event that Lee's resolution was approved when it was brought up again in July.

Support for a Congressional declaration of independence was consolidated in the final weeks of June 1776. On June 14, the Connecticut Assembly instructed its delegates to propose independence, and the following day the legislatures of New Hampshire and Delaware authorized their delegates to declare independence.<ref>Jensen, ''Founding'', 691<U+2013>92.</ref> In Pennsylvania, political struggles ended with the dissolution of the colonial assembly, and on June 18 a new Conference of Committees under [[Thomas McKean]] authorized Pennsylvania's delegates to declare independence.<ref>Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 106<U+2013>07; Jensen, ''Founding'', 691.</ref> On June 15, the [[Provincial Congress of New Jersey]], which had been governing the province since January 1776, resolved that [[Royal Governor]] [[William Franklin]] was "an enemy to the liberties of this country" and had him arrested.<ref>Jensen, ''Founding'', 692.</ref> On June 21, they chose new delegates to Congress and empowered them to join in a declaration of independence.<ref>Jensen, ''Founding'', 693.</ref>

Only Maryland and New York had yet to authorize independence. When the Continental Congress had adopted Adams's radical May 15 preamble, Maryland's delegates walked out and sent to the [[Maryland Convention]] for instructions.<ref>Jensen, ''Founding'', 694.</ref> On May 20, the Maryland Convention rejected Adams's preamble, instructing its delegates to remain against independence, but [[Samuel Chase]] went to Maryland and, thanks to local resolutions in favor of independence, was able to get the Maryland Convention to change its mind on June 28.<ref>Jensen, ''Founding'', 694<U+2013>96; Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 96; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 68.</ref> Only the New York delegates were unable to get revised instructions. When Congress had been considering the resolution of independence on June 8, the [[New York Provincial Congress]] told the delegates to wait.<ref>Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 118; Jensen, ''Founding'', 698.</ref> But on June 30, the Provincial Congress evacuated New York as British forces approached, and would not convene again until July 10. This meant that New York's delegates would not be authorized to declare independence until after Congress had made its decision.<ref>Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 119<U+2013>20.</ref>

==Draft and adoption==
[[File:Writing the Declaration of Independence 1776 cph.3g09904.jpg|thumb|This idealized depiction of (left to right) Franklin, Adams, and Jefferson working on the Declaration ([[Jean Leon Gerome Ferris]], 1900) was widely reprinted.<ref>Dupont and Onuf, 3.</ref>]]

While political maneuvering was setting the stage for an official declaration of independence, a document explaining the decision was being written. On June 11, 1776, Congress appointed a "[[Committee of Five]]", consisting of [[John Adams]] of Massachusetts, [[Benjamin Franklin]] of Pennsylvania, [[Thomas Jefferson]] of Virginia, [[Robert Livingston (1746-1813)|Robert R. Livingston]] of New York, and [[Roger Sherman]] of Connecticut, to draft a declaration. Because the committee left no minutes, there is some uncertainty about how the drafting process proceeded<U+2014>accounts written many years later by Jefferson and Adams, although frequently cited, are contradictory and not entirely reliable.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 97<U+2013>105; Boyd, ''Evolution'', 21.</ref> What is certain is that the committee, after discussing the general outline that the document should follow, decided that Jefferson would write the first draft.<ref>Boyd, ''Evolution'', 22.</ref> Considering Congress's busy schedule, Jefferson probably had limited time for writing over the next seventeen days, and likely wrote the draft quickly.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 104.</ref> He then consulted the others, made some changes, and then produced another copy incorporating these alterations. The committee presented this copy to the Congress on June 28, 1776. The title of the document was "A Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress assembled."<ref>Becker, ''Declaration of Independence'', 4.</ref> Congress ordered that the draft "[[Table (parliamentary)|lie on the table]]".<ref>Jensen, ''Founding'', 701.</ref>

On Monday, July 1, having tabled the draft of the declaration, Congress resolved itself into a [[Committee of the Whole|committee of the whole]], with Benjamin Harrison of Virginia presiding, and resumed debate on Lee's resolution of independence.<ref>Burnett, ''Continental Congress'', 181.</ref> [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] made one last effort to delay the decision, arguing that Congress should not declare independence without first securing a foreign alliance and finalizing the [[Articles of Confederation]].<ref>Jensen, ''Founding'', 699.</ref> John Adams gave a speech in reply to Dickinson, restating the case for an immediate declaration.

After a long day of speeches, a vote was taken. As always, each colony cast a single vote; the delegation for each colony<U+2014>numbering two to seven members<U+2014>voted amongst themselves to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York delegation, lacking permission to vote for independence, abstained. Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between [[Thomas McKean]] (who voted yes) and [[George Read (signer)|George Read]] (who voted no). The remaining nine delegations voted in favor of independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole. The next step was for the resolution to be voted upon by the Congress itself. [[Edward Rutledge]] of South Carolina, who was opposed to Lee's resolution but desirous of unanimity, moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.<ref>Burnett, ''Continental Congress'', 182; Jensen, ''Founding'', 700.</ref>

[[Image:Jefferson's+desk.jpg|left|thumb|Jefferson drafted the Declaration on this portable lap desk of his own design.]]

On July 2, South Carolina reversed its position and voted for independence. In the Pennsylvania delegation, Dickinson and [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] abstained, allowing the delegation to vote three-to-two in favor of independence. The tie in the Delaware delegation was broken by the timely arrival of [[Caesar Rodney]], who voted for independence. The New York delegation abstained once again, since they were still not authorized to vote for independence, although they would be allowed to do so by the [[New York Provincial Congress]] a week later.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 45.</ref> The resolution of independence had been adopted with twelve affirmative votes and one abstention. With this, the colonies had officially severed political ties with Great Britain.<ref>Boyd, ''Evolution'', 19.</ref> In a now-famous letter written to his wife on the following day, John Adams predicted that July 2 would become a great American holiday.<ref>Jensen, ''Founding'', 703<U+2013>04.</ref> Adams thought that the vote for independence would be commemorated; he did not foresee that Americans<U+2014>including himself<U+2014>would instead celebrate [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] on the date that the announcement of that act was finalized.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 160<U+2013>61.</ref>

After voting in favor of the resolution of independence, Congress turned its attention to the committee's draft of the declaration. Over several days of debate, Congress made a few changes in wording and deleted nearly a fourth of the text, most notably a passage critical of the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]], changes that Jefferson resented.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 146<U+2013>50.</ref> On July 4, 1776, the wording of the Declaration of Independence was approved and sent to the printer for publication.

==Text==
{{Wikisource|United States Declaration of Independence}}
[[Image:Yale Dunlap Broadside.jpg|thumb|The [[Dunlap broadside]] was the first published version of the Declaration.]]
The first sentence of the Declaration asserts as a matter of [[Natural law]] the ability of a people to assume political independence, and acknowledges that the grounds for such independence must be reasonable.<ref>Becker, ''Declaration of Independence'', 277-279.</ref>

<blockquote>When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the [[Natural law|Laws of Nature]] and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</blockquote>

The next section, the famous preamble, includes the ideas and ideals that were principles of the Declaration. It is also an assertion of what is known as the "[[right of revolution]]": that is, people have certain rights, and when a government violates these rights, the people have the right to "alter or abolish" that government.<ref>Becker, ''Declaration of Independence'', 9.</ref>

<blockquote>We hold these truths to be [[self-evidence|self-evident]], that [[all men are created equal]], that they are endowed by their [[Creator deity|Creator]] with certain [[Inalienable rights|unalienable Rights]],<ref>The published Declaration uses "[[wikt:unalienable|''un''alienable]]", rather than the now more common "[[wikt:inalienable|''in''alienable]]". This appears to simply be a stylistic issue, and some drafts, notably that by [[Thomas Jefferson]], used ''in''alienable. See: [http://www.ushistory.org/DECLARATION/unalienable.htm Unalienable / Inalienable]</ref> that among these are [[Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness|Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness]].

That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]], That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the [[Right of revolution|Right of the People to alter or to abolish it]], and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute [[Despotism]], it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.</blockquote>

The next section is a list of charges against King George III, which aim to demonstrate that he has violated the colonists' rights and is therefore unfit to be their ruler:<ref name=Becker214>Becker, ''Declaration of Independence'', 214-215.</ref>

<blockquote>Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and [[wikt:usurpation|usurpations]], all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

:He has refused his [[Royal Assent|Assent to Laws]], the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
:He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
:He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right [[wikt:inestimable|inestimable]] to them and formidable to tyrants only.
:He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
:He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
:He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
:He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

:He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
:He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
:He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
:He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
:He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
:He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
::For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
::For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
::For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
::For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
::For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of [[Jury trial|Trial by Jury]]:
::For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
::For [[Quebec Act|abolishing the free System of English Laws]] in a [[Province of Quebec (1763<U+2013>1791)|neighbouring Province]], establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
::For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
::For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
:He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
:He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
:He is at this time transporting [[Hessian (soldiers)|large Armies of foreign Mercenaries]] to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & [[perfidy]] scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
:He has constrained our fellow Citizens [[Impressment|taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms]] against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
:He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</blockquote>

Many Americans still felt a kinship with the people of Great Britain, and had appealed in vain to the prominent among them, as well as to [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]], to convince the King to relax his more objectionable policies toward the colonies. The next section represents disappointment that these attempts had been unsuccessful.<ref name=Becker214 />

<blockquote>Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of [[wikt:consanguinity|consanguinity]]. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.</blockquote>

In the final section, the signers assert that there exist conditions under which people must change their government, that the British have produced such conditions, and by necessity the colonies must throw off political ties with the British Crown and become independent states. The conclusion incorporates language from Lee's resolution of independence that had been passed on July 2.<ref>Becker, ''Declaration of Independence'', 210-211.</ref>

<blockquote>We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the [[The Crown|British Crown]], and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.</blockquote>

==Influences==
[[Image:John Locke.jpg|thumb|English political philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632<U+2013>1704)]]

Historians have often sought to identify the sources that most influenced the words and [[political philosophy]] of the Declaration of Independence. By Jefferson's own admission, the Declaration contained no original ideas, but was instead a statement of sentiments widely shared by supporters of the American Revolution. As he explained in 1825:

<blockquote>Neither aiming at originality of principle or sentiment, nor yet copied from any particular and previous writing, it was intended to be an expression of the American mind, and to give to that expression the proper tone and spirit called for by the occasion.<ref>{{cite web

Jefferson's most immediate sources were two documents written in June 1776: his own draft of the preamble of the [[Constitution of Virginia]], and [[George Mason]]'s draft of the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]]. Ideas and phrases from both of these documents appear in the Declaration of Independence.<ref>Malone, ''Jefferson the Virginian'', 221; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 125<U+2013>26.</ref> They were, in turn, directly influenced by the 1689 [[Bill of Rights 1689|English Declaration of Rights]], which formally ended the reign of [[James II of England|King James&nbsp;II]].<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 126<U+2013>28.</ref> During the American Revolution, Jefferson and other Americans looked to the English Declaration of Rights as a model of how to end the reign of an unjust king.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 53<U+2013>57.</ref> The Scottish [[Declaration of Arbroath]] (1320) and the Dutch [[Act of Abjuration]] (1581) have also been offered as models for Jefferson's Declaration, but these arguments have been disputed.<ref>Maier found no evidence that the Dutch Act of Abjuration served as a model for the Declaration and considers the argument "unpersuasive" (''American Scripture'', 264). Armitage discounts the influence of the Scottish and Dutch acts, and writes that neither was called "declarations of independence" until fairly recently (''Global History'', 42<U+2013>44). For the argument in favor of the influence of the Dutch act, see Stephen E. Lucas, "The 'Plakkaat van Verlatinge': A Neglected Model for the American Declaration of Independence", in Rosemarijn Hofte and Johanna C. Kardux, eds., ''Connecting Cultures: The Netherlands in Five Centuries of Transatlantic Exchange'' (Amsterdam, 1994), 189<U+2013>207.</ref>

Jefferson wrote that a number of authors exerted a general influence on the words of the Declaration.<ref>Boyd, ''Evolution'', 16<U+2013>17.</ref> The English political theorist [[John Locke]], whom Jefferson called one of "the three greatest men that have ever lived",<ref>{{cite web

Becker]] wrote that "Most Americans had absorbed Locke's works as a kind of political gospel; and the Declaration, in its form, in its phraseology, follows closely certain sentences in Locke's [[Two Treatises of Government|second treatise on government]]."<ref>Becker, ''Declaration of Independence'', 27.</ref> The extent of Locke's influence on the American Revolution has been questioned by some subsequent scholars, however. Historian Ray Forrest Harvey declared in 1937, as he argued for the dominant influence of the Swiss jurist [[Jean Jacques Burlamaqui]], that Jefferson and Locke were at "two opposite poles" in their political philosophy, as evidenced by Jefferson's use in the Declaration of Independence of the phrase "pursuit of happiness" instead of "property."<ref>Ray Forrest Harvey, ''Jean Jacques Burlamaqui: A Liberal Tradition in American Constitutionalism'' (Chapel Hill, North Carolina, 1937), 120.</ref> Other scholars emphasized the influence of [[republicanism]] rather than Locke's [[classical liberalism]].<ref>A brief, online overview of the classical liberalism vs. republicanism debate is Alec Ewald, [http://www.flowofhistory.org/themes/american_republic/overview.php "The American Republic: 1760-1870" (2004)].</ref> Historian [[Garry Wills]] argued that Jefferson was influenced by the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], particularly [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], rather than Locke,<ref>Wills, ''Inventing America'', especially chs. 11<U+2013>13. Wills concludes (p. 315) that "the air of enlightened America was full of Hutcheson's politics, not Locke's."</ref> an interpretation that has been strongly criticized.<ref>Hamowy, "Jefferson and the Scottish Enlightenment", argues that Wills gets much wrong (p. 523), that the Declaration seems to be influenced by Hutcheson because Hutcheson was, like Jefferson, influenced by Locke (pp. 508<U+2013>09), and that Jefferson often wrote of Locke's influence, but never mentioned Hutcheson in any of his writings (p. 514). See also Kenneth S. Lynn, "Falsifying Jefferson," ''Commentary'' 66 (Oct. 1978), 66<U+2013>71. [[Ralph Luker]], in [http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1980/spring/luker-garry-wills/ "Garry Wills and the New Debate Over the Declaration of Independence"] (''The Virginia Quarterly Review'', Spring 1980, 244<U+2013>61) agreed that Wills overstated Hutcheson's influence to provide a [[communitarian]] reading of the Declaration, but he also argued that Wills's critics similarly read their own views into the document.</ref>

Legal historian John Phillip Reid has written that the emphasis on the political philosophy of the Declaration has been misplaced. The Declaration is not a philosophical tract about natural rights, argues Reid, but is instead a legal document<U+2014>an [[indictment]] against King George for violating the constitutional rights of the colonists.<ref>John Phillip Reid, "The Irrelevance of the Declaration", in Hendrik Hartog, ed., ''Law in the American Revolution and the Revolution in the Law'' (New York University Press, 1981), 46<U+2013>89.</ref> In contrast, historian Dennis J. Mahoney argues that the constitution is not a legal document at all, but a philosophical document influenced by [[Emerich de Vattel]], [[Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui]], and [[Samuel Pufendorf]].<ref>Mahoney, ''Declaration  of Independence''.</ref> Historian [[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]] has argued that the Declaration is a document of [[international law]]. According to Armitage, the Declaration was strongly influenced by de Vattel's ''The Law of Nations'', a book that Benjamin Franklin said was "continually in the hands of the members of our Congress".<ref>Benjamin Franklin to Charles F.W. Dumas, December 19, 1775, in ''The Writings of Benjamin Franklin'', ed. Albert Henry Smyth (New York: 1970), 6:432.</ref> Armitage writes that because "Vattel made independence fundamental to his definition of statehood", the primary purpose of the Declaration was "to express the international legal sovereignty of the United States". If the United States were to have any hope of being recognized by the European powers, the American revolutionaries had to first make it clear that they were no longer dependent on Great Britain.<ref>Armitage, ''Global History'', 21, 38<U+2013>40.</ref>

==Signing==
{{Main|Signing the United States Declaration of Independence}}

[[Image:USA declaration independence.jpg|thumb|The signed copy of the Declaration, now badly faded, is on display at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in [[Washington, DC]].]]

The handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence that was signed by Congress is dated July 4, 1776. The signatures of fifty-six delegates are affixed; however, whether or not Congress actually signed the document on this date has long been the subject of debate. Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and John Adams all wrote that the Declaration had been signed by Congress on July 4.<ref>Warren, "Fourth of July Myths", 242<U+2013>43.</ref> But in 1796, signer [[Thomas McKean]] disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not then present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date.<ref>Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 299<U+2013>302; Burnett, ''Continental Congress'', 192.</ref> 

According to the 1911 record of events by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], under Sec. [[Philander C. Knox]], the Declaration was transposed on paper, adopted by the Continental Congress, and signed by [[John Hancock]], President of the Congress, on July 4, 1776.  <ref name="U.S. State Department"> The U.S. State Department (1911), ''The Declaration of Independence, 1776'', pp. 10, 11.</ref> On August 2, 1776 a parchment paper copy of the Declaration was signed by 56 persons. <ref name="U.S. State Department"/> Many of these signers were not present when the original Declaration was adopted on July 4. <ref name="U.S. State Department"/>  One signer, [[Matthew Thornton]], from [[New Hampshire]], who agreed to the Declaration and having joined the Continental Congress, signed on November 4, 1776. <ref name="U.S. State Department"/>   

Historians have generally accepted McKean's version of events, arguing that the famous signed version of the Declaration was created after July 19 and was not signed by Congress until August 2.<ref>Warren, "Fourth of July Myths", 245<U+2013>46; Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 208<U+2013>19; Wills, ''Inventing America'', 341.</ref> In 1986, legal historian Wilfred Ritz argued that historians had misunderstood the primary documents and given too much credence to McKean, who had not been present in Congress on July 4.<ref>Ritz, "Authentication", 179<U+2013>200.</ref> According to Ritz, about thirty-four delegates signed the Declaration on July 4, and the others signed on or after August 2.<ref>Ritz, "Authentication", 194.</ref> Historians who reject a July 4 signing maintain that most delegates signed on August 2, and that those eventual signers who were not present added their names later.<ref>Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 208<U+2013>19.</ref>

[[image:JohnHancocksSignature.svg |250px |thumb |right |On July 4, 1776, Continental Congress President [[John Hancock]] signed the United States Declaration of Independence.]]

The most famous signature on the engrossed copy is that of [[John Hancock]], who, as [[President of the Continental Congress|President of Congress]], presumably signed first.<ref>Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 209.</ref> Hancock's large, flamboyant signature became iconic, and ''John Hancock'' emerged in the United States as an informal synonym for "signature".<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/John%20Hancock Merriam-Webster online]; [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/john%20hancock Dictionary.com].</ref> Two future U.S. presidents, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, were among the signatories.

Various legends about the signing of the Declaration emerged years later, when the document had become an important national symbol. In one famous story, John Hancock supposedly said that Congress, having signed the Declaration, must now "all hang together", and Benjamin Franklin replied: "Yes, we must indeed all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately." The quote did not appear in print until more than fifty years after Franklin's death.<ref>Malone, ''Story of the Declaration'', 91.</ref>

==Publication and reaction==

[[Image:Johannes Adam Simon Oertel Pulling Down the Statue of King George III, N.Y.C. ca. 1859.jpg|thumb|Johannes Adam Simon Oertel's painting ''Pulling Down the Statue of King George III, N.Y.C.'', ca. 1859, depicts citizens destroying a statue of King George after the Declaration was read in New York City on July 9, 1776.]]

After Congress approved the final wording of the Declaration on July 4, a handwritten copy was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of [[John Dunlap]]. Through the night Dunlap printed about 200 [[Broadside (printing)|broadsides]] for distribution. Before long, the Declaration was read to audiences and reprinted in newspapers across the thirteen states. The first official public reading of the document was by [[John Nixon (financier)|John Nixon]] in the yard of [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]] on July 8; public readings also took place on that day in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], and [[Easton, Pennsylvania]].<ref name="Maier156">Maier, ''American Scripture'', 156.</ref> A German translation of the Declaration was published in Philadelphia by July 9.<ref>Armitage, ''Global History'', 72.</ref>

President of Congress John Hancock sent a broadside to General [[George Washington]], instructing him to have it proclaimed "at the Head of the Army in the way you shall think it most proper".<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 155.</ref> Washington had the Declaration read to his troops in [[New York City]] on July 9, with the British forces not far away. Washington and Congress hoped the Declaration would inspire the soldiers, and encourage others to join the army.<ref name="Maier156"/> After hearing the Declaration, crowds in many cities tore down and destroyed signs or statues representing royalty. An equestrian statue of King George in New York City was pulled down and the lead used to make musket balls.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 156<U+2013>57.</ref>

British officials in North America sent copies of the Declaration to Great Britain.<ref>Armitage, ''Global History'', 73.</ref> It was published in British newspapers beginning in mid-August; translations appeared in European newspapers soon after.<ref>Armitage, ''Global History'', 70.</ref> The [[North Ministry]] did not give an official answer to the Declaration, but instead secretly commissioned pamphleteer [[John Lind (barrister)|John Lind]] to publish a response, which was entitled ''Answer to the Declaration of the American Congress''.<ref>Armitage, ''Global History'', 75.</ref> [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]], the former royal governor of Massachusetts, also published a rebuttal.<ref>Armitage, ''Global History'', 74.</ref> These pamphlets challenged various aspects of the Declaration. Hutchinson argued that the American Revolution was the work of a few conspirators who wanted independence from the outset, and who had finally achieved it by inducing otherwise loyal colonists to rebel.<ref>Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 155<U+2013>56.</ref> Lind's pamphlet included an anonymous attack on the concept of [[natural rights]] written by [[Jeremy Bentham]], an argument he would repeat during the [[French Revolution]].<ref>Armitage, ''Global History'', 79<U+2013>80.</ref> Both pamphlets asked how slave owners in Congress could proclaim that "all men are created equal" without then freeing their own slaves.<ref>Armitage, ''Global History'', 76<U+2013>77.</ref>

==History of the documents==
{{main|Physical history of the United States Declaration of Independence}}

The copy of the Declaration that was signed by Congress is known as the engrossed or [[parchment]] copy. It was probably engrossed (that is, carefully handwritten) by clerk [[Timothy Matlack]].<ref name=archives>{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_history.html |title=The Declaration of Independence: A History |author= |date= |work=Charters of Freedom |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref> Because of poor conservation of the engrossed copy through the 19th century, a facsimile made in 1823, rather than the original, has become the basis of most modern reproductions.<ref name=archives /> In 1921, custody of the engrossed copy of the Declaration, along with the [[United States Constitution]], was transferred from the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] to the [[Library of Congress]]. After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, the documents were moved for safekeeping to the [[United States Bullion Depository]] at [[Fort Knox]] in Kentucky, where they were kept until 1944.<ref>Malone, ''Story of the Declaration'', 263.</ref> In 1952, the engrossed Declaration was transferred to the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]], and is now on permanent display at the National Archives in the "Rotunda for the [[Charters of Freedom]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/press/press-kits/charters.html#pressrelaese1 |title=Charters of Freedom Re-encasement Project|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] |date= |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:ArchivesRotunda.jpg|thumb|The Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom in the National Archives building]]

Although the document signed by Congress and enshrined in the National Archives is usually regarded as ''the'' Declaration of Independence, historian [[Julian P. Boyd]] argued that the Declaration, like [[Magna Carta]], is not a single document. Boyd considered the printed broadsides ordered by Congress to be official texts as well. The Declaration was first published as a broadside that was printed the night of July 4 by [[John Dunlap]] of Philadelphia. Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides, of which 26 are known to survive. The 26th copy was discovered in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] in England in 2009.<ref>{{cite news |title= Rare copy of United States Declaration of Independence found in Kew |first= |last= |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/5727812/Rare-copy-of-United-States-Declaration-of-Independence-found-in-Kew.html |newspaper= The Daily Telegraph |date=July 3, 2009 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref> In 1777, Congress commissioned [[Mary Katherine Goddard]] to print a new broadside that, unlike the Dunlap broadside, listed the signers of the Declaration.<ref name=archives /><ref name=Dube /> Nine copies of the Goddard broadside are known to still exist.<ref name=Dube>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/dube/inde2.htm |title=The Declaration of Independence |author=Ann Marie Dube |date=May 1996 |work=A Multitude of Amendments, Alterations and Additions: The Writing and Publicizing of the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the Constitution of the United States |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref> A variety of broadsides printed by the states are also extant.<ref name=Dube />

Several early handwritten copies and drafts of the Declaration have also been preserved. Jefferson kept a four-page draft that late in life he called the "original Rough draught".<ref name="Boyd, Lost Original, 446">Boyd, "Lost Original", 446.</ref> How many drafts Jefferson wrote prior to this one, and how much of the text was contributed by other committee members, is unknown. In 1947, Boyd discovered a fragment of an earlier draft in Jefferson's handwriting.<ref>Boyd, ''Papers of Jefferson'', 1:421.</ref> Jefferson and Adams sent copies of the rough draft, with slight variations, to friends.

During the writing process, Jefferson showed the rough draft to Adams and Franklin, and perhaps other members of the drafting committee,<ref name="Boyd, Lost Original, 446"/> who made a few more changes. Franklin, for example, may have been responsible for changing Jefferson's original phrase "We hold these truths to be sacred and undeniable" to "We hold these truths to be self-evident".<ref>Becker, ''Declaration of Independence'', 142 note 1. Boyd (''Papers of Jefferson'', 1:427<U+2013>28) casts doubt on Becker's belief that the change was made by Franklin.</ref> Jefferson incorporated these changes into a copy that was submitted to Congress in the name of the committee.<ref name="Boyd, Lost Original, 446"/> The copy that was submitted to Congress on June 28 has been lost, and was perhaps destroyed in the printing process,<ref>Boyd, "Lost Original", 448<U+2013>50. Boyd argued that if a document was signed on July 4--which he thought unlikely--it would have been the Fair Copy, and probably would have been signed only by Hancock and Thomson.</ref> or destroyed during the debates in accordance with [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Record of proceedings|Congress's secrecy rule]].<ref>Ritz, "From the ''Here''", speculates that the Fair Copy was immediately sent to the printer so that copies could be made for each member of Congress to consult during the debate. All of these copies were then destroyed, theorizes Ritz, to preserve secrecy.</ref>

==Legacy==
Having served its original purpose in announcing the independence of the United States, the Declaration was initially neglected in the years immediately following the American Revolution.<ref>Armitage, ''Global History'', 87<U+2013>88; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 162, 168<U+2013>69.</ref> Early celebrations of [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], like early histories of the Revolution, largely ignored the Declaration. Although the ''act'' of declaring independence was considered important, the ''text'' announcing that act attracted little attention.<ref>McDonald, "Jefferson's Reputation", 178<U+2013>79; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 160.</ref> The Declaration was rarely mentioned during the debates about the [[United States Constitution]], and its language was not incorporated into that document.<ref>Armitage, ''Global History'', 92.</ref> George Mason's draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights was more influential, and its language was echoed in state constitutions and state bills of rights more often than Jefferson's words.<ref>Armitage, ''Global History'', 90; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 165<U+2013>67.</ref> "In none of these documents", wrote Pauline Maier, "is there any evidence whatsoever that the Declaration of Independence lived in men's minds as a classic statement of American political principles."<ref name="Maier167">Maier, ''American Scripture'', 167.</ref>

===Influence in other countries===
Some leaders of the [[French Revolution]] admired the Declaration of Independence<ref name="Maier167"/> but were more interested in the new American state constitutions.<ref>Armitage, ''Global History'', 82.</ref> The French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen]] (1789) borrowed language from George Mason's Virginia Declaration of Rights and not Jefferson's Declaration, although Jefferson was in Paris at the time and was consulted during the drafting process.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 166<U+2013>68.</ref> According to historian [[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]], the United States Declaration of Independence did prove to be internationally influential, but not as a statement of human rights. Armitage argued that the Declaration was the first in a new genre of [[Declaration of independence|declarations of independence]] that announced the creation of new states. 

Other French leaders were directly influenced by the text of the Declaration of Independence itself. The ''Manifesto of the Province of Flanders'' (1790) was the first foreign derivation of the Declaration;<ref>Armitage, ''Global History'', 113.</ref> others include the [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence]] (1811), the [[Liberian Declaration of Independence]] (1847), the declarations of secession by the [[Confederate States of America]] (1860<U+2013>61), and the Vietnam Declaration of Independence (1945).<ref>Armitage, ''Global History'', 120<U+2013>35.</ref> These declarations echoed the United States Declaration of Independence in announcing the independence of a new state, without necessarily endorsing the political philosophy of the original.<ref>Armitage, ''Global History'', 104, 113.</ref>

===Revival of interest===
In the United States, interest in the Declaration was revived in the 1790s with the emergence of America's [[First Party System|first political parties]].<ref>McDonald, "Jefferson's Reputation", 172.</ref> Throughout the 1780s, few Americans knew, or cared, who wrote the Declaration.<ref>McDonald, "Jefferson's Reputation", 172, 179.</ref> But in the next decade, [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republicans]] sought political advantage over their rival [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] by promoting both the importance of the Declaration and Jefferson as its author.<ref>McDonald, "Jefferson's Reputation", 179; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 168<U+2013>71.</ref> Federalists responded by casting doubt on Jefferson's authorship or originality, and by emphasizing that independence was declared by the whole Congress, with Jefferson as just one member of the drafting committee. Federalists insisted that Congress's act of declaring independence, in which Federalist John Adams had played a major role, was more important than the document announcing that act.<ref>McDonald, "Jefferson's Reputation", 180<U+2013>84; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 171.</ref> But this view, like the Federalist Party, would fade away, and before long the act of declaring independence would become synonymous with the document.

A less partisan appreciation for the Declaration emerged in the years following the War of 1812, thanks to a growing American nationalism and a renewed interest in the history of the Revolution.<ref>Detweiler, "Changing Reputation", 571<U+2013>72; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 175<U+2013>78.</ref> In 1817, Congress commissioned [[John Trumbull]]'s [[Trumbull's Declaration of Independence|famous painting]] of the signers, which was exhibited to large crowds before being installed in the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]].<ref>Detweiler, "Changing Reputation", 572; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 175.</ref> The earliest commemorative printings of the Declaration also appeared at this time, offering many Americans their first view of the signed document.<ref>Detweiler, "Changing Reputation", 572; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 175<U+2013>76; Wills, ''Inventing America'', 324. See also John C. Fitzpatrick, ''Spirit of the Revolution'' (Boston 1924).</ref> Collective biographies of the signers were first published in the 1820s,<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 176.</ref> giving birth to what Garry Wills called the "cult of the signers".<ref>Wills, ''Inventing America'', 90.</ref> In the years that followed, many stories about the writing and signing of the document would be published for the first time.

When interest in the Declaration was revived, the sections that were most important in 1776<U+2014>the announcement of the independence of the United States and the grievances against King George<U+2014>were no longer relevant. But the second paragraph, with its talk of self-evident truths and unalienable rights, were applicable long after the war had ended.<ref>Armitage, "Global History," 93.</ref> Because the Constitution and the Bill of Rights lacked sweeping statements about rights and equality, advocates of marginalized groups turned to the Declaration for support.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 196<U+2013>97.</ref> Starting in the 1820s, variations of the Declaration were issued to proclaim the rights of workers, farmers, women, and others.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 197. See also Philip S. Foner, ed., ''We, the Other People: Alternative Declarations of Independence by Labor Groups, Farmers, Woman's Rights Advocates, Socialists, and Blacks, 1829<U+2013>1975'' (Urbana 1976).</ref> In 1848, for example, the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], a meeting of women's rights advocates, [[Declaration of Sentiments|declared]] that "all men and women are created equal".<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 197; Armitage, ''Global History'', 95.</ref> 

===Slavery and the Declaration===
{{see |Slavery in the colonial United States}}
The Declaration would have its most prominent influence on the debate over slavery.<ref name=WB287>Wyatt-Brown, ''Lewis Tappan'', 287.</ref> The contradiction between the claim that "all men are created equal" and the existence of [[Slavery in the United States|American slavery]] attracted comment when the Declaration was first published. As mentioned above, although Jefferson had included a paragraph in his initial draft that strongly indicted Britain's role in the slave trade, this was deleted from the final version.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 146<U+2013>50.</ref>   Jefferson himself was a prominent [[Virginia]] slave holder having owned hundreds of slaves.<ref>Cohen (1969), ''Thomas Jefferson and the Problem of Slavery''</ref> Referring to this seeming contradiction, English abolitionist [[Thomas Day]] wrote in a 1776 letter, "If there be an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, signing resolutions of independency with the one hand, and with the other brandishing a whip over his affrighted slaves."<ref>Armitage, ''Global History'', 77.</ref> In the 19th century, the Declaration took on a special significance for the abolitionist movement. Historian Bertram Wyatt-Brown wrote that "abolitionists tended to interpret the Declaration of Independence as a theological as well as a political document".<ref name=WB287 /> Abolitionist leaders [[Benjamin Lundy]] and [[William Lloyd Garrison]] adopted the "twin rocks" of "the Bible and the Declaration of Independence" as the basis for their philosophies. "As long as there remains a single copy of the Declaration of Independence, or of the Bible, in our land," wrote Garrison, "we will not despair."<ref>Mayer, ''All on Fire'', 53, 115.</ref> For radical abolitionists like Garrison, the most important part of the Declaration was its assertion of the [[right of revolution]]: Garrison called for the destruction of the government under the Constitution, and the creation of a new state dedicated to the principles of the Declaration.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 198<U+2013>99.</ref>

The controversial question of whether to add additional [[slave state]]s to the United States coincided with the growing stature of the Declaration. The first major public debate about slavery and the Declaration took place during the [[Missouri Compromise|Missouri controversy]] of 1819 to 1821.<ref>Detweiler, "Congressional Debate", 598.</ref> Antislavery Congressmen argued that the language of the Declaration indicated that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] had been opposed to slavery in principle, and so new slave states should not be added to the country.<ref>Detweiler, "Congressional Debate", 604.</ref> Proslavery Congressmen, led by Senator [[Nathaniel Macon]] of North Carolina, argued that since the Declaration was not a part of the Constitution, it had no relevance to the question.<ref>Detweiler, "Congressional Debate", 605.</ref>

With the antislavery movement gaining momentum, defenders of slavery such as [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]] and [[John C. Calhoun]] found it necessary to argue that the Declaration's assertion that "all men are created equal" was false, or at least that it did not apply to black people.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 199; Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 246.</ref> During the debate over the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] in 1853, for example, Senator [[John Pettit]] of Indiana argued that "all men are created equal", rather than a "self-evident truth", was a "self-evident lie".<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 200.</ref> Opponents of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, including [[Salmon P. Chase]] and [[Benjamin Wade]], defended the Declaration and what they saw as its antislavery principles.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 200<U+2013>01.</ref>

===Lincoln and the Declaration===
The Declaration's relationship to slavery was taken up in 1854 by [[Abraham Lincoln]], a little-known former Congressman who idolized the Founding Fathers.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 201<U+2013>02.</ref> Lincoln thought that the Declaration of Independence expressed the highest principles of the American Revolution, and that the Founding Fathers had tolerated slavery with the expectation that it would ultimately wither away.<ref name="McPherson126"/> For the United States to legitimize the expansion of slavery in the Kansas-Nebraska Act, thought Lincoln, was to repudiate the principles of the Revolution. In his October 1854 [[Abraham Lincoln Peoria speech|Peoria speech]], Lincoln said:

{{quote|Nearly eighty years ago we began by declaring that all men are created equal; but now from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration, that for some men to enslave others is a "sacred right of self-government." ... Our republican robe is soiled and trailed in the dust.  Let us repurify it. ... Let us re-adopt the Declaration of Independence, and with it, the practices, and policy, which harmonize with it. ... If we do this, we shall not only have saved the Union: but we shall have saved it, as to make, and keep it, forever worthy of the saving.<ref>McPherson, ''Second American Revolution'', 126<U+2013>27.</ref>}}

The meaning of the Declaration was a recurring topic in the [[Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858|famed debates]] between Lincoln and [[Stephen Douglas]] in 1858. Douglas argued that "all men are created equal" in the Declaration referred to white men only. The purpose of the Declaration, he said, had simply been to justify the independence of the United States, and not to proclaim the equality of any "inferior or degraded race".<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 204.</ref> Lincoln, however, thought that the language of the Declaration was deliberately universal, setting a high moral standard for which the American republic should aspire. "I had thought the Declaration contemplated the progressive improvement in the condition of all men everywhere", he said.<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 204<U+2013>05.</ref> According to Pauline Maier, Douglas's interpretation was more historically accurate, but Lincoln's view ultimately prevailed. "In Lincoln's hands", wrote Maier, "the Declaration of Independence became first and foremost a living document" with "a set of goals to be realized over time".<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'', 207.</ref>

{{quote box|align=right|width=33%|quote=''[T]here is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man.''|source=Abraham Lincoln, 1858<ref>Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'', 100.</ref>}}

Like [[Daniel Webster]], [[James Wilson]], and [[Joseph Story]] before him, Lincoln argued that the Declaration of Independence was a founding document of the United States, and that this had important implications for interpreting the Constitution, which had been ratified more than a decade after the Declaration.<ref>Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'', 129<U+2013>31.</ref> Although the Constitution did not use the word "equality", Lincoln believed that "all men are created equal" remained a part of the nation's founding principles.<ref>Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'', 145.</ref> He famously expressed this belief in the opening sentence of his 1863 [[Gettysburg Address]]: "Four score and seven years ago [i.e. in 1776] our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."

Lincoln's [[Declarationism|view of the Declaration]] as a moral guide to interpreting the Constitution became influential. "For most people now," wrote Garry Wills in 1992, "the Declaration means what Lincoln told us it means, as a way of correcting the Constitution itself without overthrowing it."<ref>Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'', 147.</ref> Admirers of Lincoln, such as [[Harry V. Jaffa]], praised this development. Critics of Lincoln, notably [[Willmoore Kendall]] and [[Mel Bradford]], argued that Lincoln dangerously expanded the scope of the national government, and violated [[states' rights]], by reading the Declaration into the Constitution.<ref>Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'', 39, 145<U+2013>46. See also Harry V. Jaffa, ''Crisis of the House Divided'' (1959) and ''A New Birth of Freedom: Abraham Lincoln and the Coming of the Civil War'' (2000); Willmoore Kendall and George W. Carey, ''The Basic Symbols of the American Political Tradition'' (1970); and M.E. Bradford, "The Heresy of Equality: A Reply to Harry Jaffa" (1976), reprinted in ''A Better Guide than Reason'' (1979) and ''Modern Age, the First Twenty-five Years'' (1988).</ref>

===In popular culture===
[[File:Signing_of_Declaration_1869_Issue-24c.jpg|thumb|Presentation of the Declaration depicted on a [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States#History of The United States on U.S. Postage Stamps|United States postal issue]] of 1869]]

The adoption of the Declaration of Independence was dramatized in the 1969 [[Tony Award]]-winning musical play ''[[1776 (musical)|1776]]'', and the 1972 movie of the [[1776 (film)|same name]], as well as in the 2008 television miniseries ''[[John Adams (miniseries)|John Adams]]''. The engrossed copy of the Declaration is central to the 2004 Hollywood film ''[[National Treasure (film)|National Treasure]]'', in which the main character steals the document because he believes it has secret clues to a treasure hidden by some of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. The Declaration figures prominently in ''[[The Probability Broach]]'', wherein the point of divergence rests in the addition of a single word to the document, causing it to state that governments "derive their just power from the ''unanimous'' consent of the governed". The Declaration also plays a major part in ''[[Honour Among Thieves]]'', a novel by [[Jeffrey Archer]] where [[Saddam Hussein]] tries to steal the Declaration and publicly burn it on July 4.
