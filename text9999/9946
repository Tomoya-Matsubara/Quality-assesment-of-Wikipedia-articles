A '''[[conurbation]]''' is formed when towns expand sufficiently that their urban areas join up with each other.  This process has happened many times in the [[United Kingdom]].  In many cases, there are differences of interpretation as to the limits of a conurbation - where it begins and ends.  For the purposes of consistency, the list on this page sets out '''urban areas as defined by the [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS)'''.

The ONS definition of an [[urban area]] is based on the continuously built-up area, and is as follows:- <blockquote>''"The definition of an urban area is an extent of at least 20 hectares and at least 1,500 residents at the time of the 2001 Census. The starting point is the identification by OS (Ordnance Survey) of areas with land use which is irreversibly urban in character. This comprises  permanent structures and the land on which they are situated, including land enclosed by or closely associated with such structures; transportation corridors such as roads, railways and canals which have built up land on one or both sides, or which link built-up sites which are less than 200 metres apart; transportation features such as airports and operational airfields, railway yards, motorway service areas and car parks;  mine buildings, excluding mineral workings and quarries; and any area completely surrounded by builtup sites. Areas such as playing fields and golf courses are excluded unless completely surrounded by builtup sites. The prerequisite for the recognition of an urban area is that the area of urban land should extend for 20 hectares or more. Separate areas of urban land are linked if less than 200 metres apart. Land between built-up areas is not regarded as urban unless it satisfies one of the conditions listed above."''<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/census2001/ks_urban_north_part_1.pdf ONS definition of urban areas]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

==List of most populous urban areas==
The list below shows the most populous urban areas in the UK as defined by the [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS), showing all those with a population in excess of 100,000 at the 2001 census.

==Commentary==
There is a spectrum that can be drawn between the conurbations that have a clear 'head' (such as Bristol and Leicester) to those that do not, known as multi-centred conurbations (such as Bournemouth/Poole and Teesside), via ones that are more borderline (West Midlands).  In the case of the West Midlands, for example, the largest city, Birmingham did expand massively and is now considered to include areas that were formerly independent towns, such as [[Sutton Coldfield]] and [[Aston, West Midlands|Aston]].  However, here it stopped, with the Black Country and Wolverhampton retaining strong identities.

There are also various places where whilst not actually running into each other, the amount of development in a large area is substantial.  Heavily built up areas of this type include :

*[[South Hampshire]], consisting of the Portsmouth and Southampton areas mentioned above, was considered for [[metropolitan county]] status in the 1970s
*[[West Yorkshire]] and [[South Yorkshire]], which are both heavily built up but not entirely devoid of countryside (both are metropolitan counties)
*[[Cardiff]]/[[Newport]], consisting of the cities of [[Cardiff]] and [[Newport]], [[Cwmbran]], much of the eastern South Wales Valleys with towns such as [[Risca]], [[Ebbw Vale]], [[Pontypool]] and [[Caerphilly]] and part of the [[Vale of Glamorgan]] including [[Penarth]] and [[Barry, Wales|Barry]].

Smaller examples of conurbations also exist on a more local level.  For example, [[Harrogate]] runs into [[Knaresborough]], [[Warwick]] runs into [[Leamington Spa]] and [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] runs into [[Morecambe]], which in turn runs into [[Heysham]].

In [[Merseyside]] there is a split between [[Liverpool Urban Area]] and the [[Birkenhead#Geography|Birkenhead Urban Area]]. These two localities are [[Greater Merseyside|often thought to be a single region, Greater Merseyside]], as only the distance of the [[River Mersey]] separates them. Together, they have a population of 1,135,891.
