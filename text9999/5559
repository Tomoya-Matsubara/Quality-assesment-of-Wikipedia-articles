The '''Institute of Pacific Relations''' (IPR) was an international organization established in 1925 to provide a forum for discussion of problems and relations between nations of the Pacific Rim. IPR was governed by the "Pacific Council," with National Councils in the U. S., Russia, China, Japan, Australia, and 10 other countries.<ref>

</ref> IPR was founded in the spirit of "Wilsonian internationalism," an awareness of the United States' new role as a world power after [[World War I]], and a belief that liberal democracy should be promoted throughout the world. To promote greater knowledge of issues, the IPR supported conferences, research projects and publications, and after 1932 published a quarterly journal ''Pacific Affairs''.

IPR was financed by important grants from [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], the [[Carnegie Corporation]], and other major corporations.  According to IPR American Council Executive Secretary (and self-proclaimed [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] member)<ref>Kai Bird and Svetlana Chervonnaya, <U+201C>[http://www.theamericanscholar.org/su07/ales-bird.html The Mystery of Ales],<U+201D> ''The American Scholar'', Summer 2007</ref> [[Frederick Vanderbilt Field]], these organizations subsidized his publication of proposals "as anticapitalistic as the articles he wrote in later decades for ''[[The New Masses]]'' and ''[[The Daily Worker]]''."<ref>''Robert Sherrill, "[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E0DB173BF935A25753C1A965948260 A Life Devoted to a Lost Cause]," ''New York Times'', October 16, 1983</ref>

Field had been hired in 1928 by IPR Secretary General [[Edward Clark Carter|Edward C. Carter]], a self-described "[[fellow traveler]]".<ref>[http://Ultra-Secret.info/PDFs/IPR02.pdf FBI file: Institute of Pacific Relations, Section 2], PDF p. 3</ref> Carter also hired Field's Harvard classmate [[Joseph Barnes]] (who was later identified as a Communist by four different witnesses under oath),<ref>"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,821608-1,00.html The Case Against I.P.R.]," ''Time'', September 3, 1951</ref> as well as [[Owen Lattimore]], who became editor of ''Pacific Affairs''.

Among other IPR staffers identified later as Communists or collaborators with Soviet intelligence agents were Kathleen Barnes, Hilda Austern, Elsie Fairfax-Cholmely, Chi Chao-ting, Guenter Stein, Harriet Levine, Talitha Gerlach, [[Chen Han-seng]] (a member of the [[Richard Sorge|Sorge]] spy ring)<ref>Maochen Yu, "[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/topics/pubs/ACF1AE.pdf Chen Hansheng's Memoirs and Chinese Communist Espionage]," ''Cold War International History Project Bulletin'', 6-7 (Winter 1995/1996), p. 274</ref>, [[Michael Greenberg]] (named as a source in 1945 by defecting Soviet courier [[Elizabeth Bentley]]), and T.A. Bisson (Venona's "Arthur")<ref>Robert L. Benson, [http://www.nsa.gov/publications/publi00039.cfm#N7 The Venona Story].

IPR was closely allied with ''[[Amerasia]]''. The two organizations shared the same building, and many members of the Editorial Board of ''Amerasia'' were officers or employees of IPR. <ref>Office memorandum: Rosen to Ladd, Re European Recovery Program, November 22, 1949, p. 3 ([http://www.education-research.org/PDFs/IPR04.pdf FBI file: Institute of Pacific Relations, Section 47], PDF p. 44)</ref> An FBI review of ''Amerasia'' and IPR publications found that approximately 115 people contributed articles to both.<ref>FBI Report: Institute of Pacific Relations, January 18, 1951 ([http://education-research.org/PDFs/IPR47.pdf FBI file: Institute of Pacific Relations, Section 47]), PDF p. 9</ref>

Soviet defector Gen. Alexander Barmine told FBI investigators that then-chief of Soviet Army intelligence Gen. Berzin told him in 1935 that IPR in China was cover for Soviet military intelligence.<ref>Teletype, April 1950 ([http://education-research.org/PDFs/IPR04.pdf FBI file: Institute of Pacific Relations, Section 4], PDF p. 134)</ref>

Many of the members of IPR were also among those referred to as the [[China Hands]]--a group of American diplomats known for their expertise on [[China]] and the Far East. As the [[Chinese Civil War]] began to go in the favor of the [[Communism|Communists]], some among the China Hands recommended that a Communist China should be accepted as inevitable, and that the U.S. should open relations with [[Mao Zedong]] to prevent China from allying itself too closely with the [[Soviet Union]]. This led to accusations by the [[China Lobby]] that policies drafted by the China Hands had "lost" China to Communism, and to charges that a Communist conspiracy was at work among the China Hands and within the Institute of Pacific Relations.

In the early fifties, the IPR came under what one author called "a relentless attack from the American right",<ref>

</ref> which included a lengthy investigation by the [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Senate Internal Security Subcommittee]]. This controversy resulted in legal battles and reduced funding for IPR.  The Institute ceased operations in 1960.  The attacks on the Institute began with a study by dissident IPR member [[Alfred Kohlberg]], an American businessman who had owned a textile firm in prewar China. After finding what he believed were Communist sympathies in IPR, Kohlberg first published an 80-page report, then launched a publicity campaign against the Institute. This eventually led to Congressional investigations of IPR.<ref>

Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] of Wisconsin repeatedly criticized IPR and its former chairman [[Philip Jessup]]. McCarthy observed that [[Frederick V. Field]], [[T.A. Bisson]], and [[Owen Lattimore]] were  active in IPR and claimed that they had worked to turn American China policy in favor of the [[Communist Party of China]].

In 1952, the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee (SISS), chaired by Senator [[Pat McCarran]], spent over a year reviewing some 20,000 documents from the files of IPR and questioning IPR personnel. It was revealed that [[Marxism|Marxists]] had published articles in the IPR journal and that Communists had attended an IPR conference in 1942. In its final report the SISS stated:

{{cquote|The IPR itself was like a specialized political flypaper in its attractive power for Communists ... British Communists like [[Michael Greenberg]], Elsie Fairfax-Cholmeley, and Anthony Jenkinson; Chinese Communists like Chi Chao-ting, [[Chen Han-seng|Chen Han-Seng]], Chu Tong, or Y.Y. Hsu; German Communists like Hans Moeller (Asiaticus) or Guenter Stein; Japanese Communists (and espionage agents) like Saionji and Ozaki; United States Communists like James S. Allen, [[Frederick Vanderbilt Field|Frederick Field]], [[William Mandel]], Lawrence Rosinger, and [[Alger Hiss]].<ref>''Institute of Pacific Relations'', report of the Senate Internal Security subcommittee, 1952, p. 97</ref>}}

The unanimous report concluded:

{{cquote|The IPR has been considered by the American Communist Party and by Soviet officials as an instrument of Communist policy, propaganda and [[military intelligence]]. The IPR disseminated and sought to popularize false information including information originating from Soviet and Communist sources.[<U+2026>] The IPR was a vehicle used by the Communists to orient American far eastern policies toward Communist objectives.<ref>''Institute of Pacific Relations'', report of the Senate Internal Security subcommittee, 1952, p. 223-225</ref>}}

[[Elizabeth Bentley]] testified that [[NKVD]] spy chief [[Jacob Golos]] warned her to stay away from the IPR because it was "as red as a rose, and you shouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole."<ref>Senate Internal Security Committee, Hearings on the Institute of Pacific Relations, p. 437</ref>. Likewise, [[Louis Budenz]], former editor  of the ''[[Daily Worker]]'', testified that Alexander Trachtenberg of the Communist Party-affiliated International Publishers told him that party leaders thought the IPR was "too much a concentration point for Communist; the control could be maintained without such a galaxy of Communists in it."<ref>''Institute of Pacific Relations'', report of the Senate Internal Security subcommittee, 1952, p. 97</ref>

The accusations of a subversive conspiracy were never substantiated.  Critics charged that IPR scholars had at times been na<U+00EF>ve in their statements regarding Communism and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalinist]] Russia. Owen Lattimore was charged with perjury in testimony before the SISS in 1952. After many of the counts were rejected by a Federal judge and one of the witnesses confessed to perjury, the case was dropped in 1955. 

The IPR lost its tax-exempt status as an educational body in 1955, when the [[Internal Revenue Service]] alleged that the Institute had engaged in the dissemination of controversial and partisan propaganda, and had attempted to influence the policies or opinions of the government. The IPR's legal actions to regain tax-exempt status lasted until 1959.  The final court judgment rejected all allegations by the Internal Revenue Service.<ref>

Despite the outcome, the IPR's finances were exhausted by the protracted litigation, and the institute dissolved in 1960.
