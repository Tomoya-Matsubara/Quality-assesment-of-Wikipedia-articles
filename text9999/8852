'''Extratropical cyclones''', sometimes called '''mid-latitude cyclones''', are a group of [[cyclone]]s defined as [[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic scale]] [[Low pressure area|low pressure]] weather systems that occur in the middle latitudes of the Earth having neither [[tropical cyclone|tropical]] nor [[polar cyclone|polar]] characteristics, and are connected with [[Surface weather analysis|fronts]] and horizontal [[gradient]]s in [[temperature]] and [[dew point]] otherwise known as "baroclinic zones".<ref name="ExtraLessonMillUni"> {{cite web| title = ESCI 241 <U+2013> Meteorology; Lesson 16 <U+2013> Extratropical Cyclones| author = Dr. DeCaria| publisher = [http://muweb.millersville.edu/~esci/ Department of Earth Sciences, Millersville University, Millersville, Pennsylvania]| date = [[2005-12-07]]| url = http://www.atmos.millersville.edu/~adecaria/ESCI241/esci241_lesson16_cyclones.html| accessdate = 2006-10-21  }} </ref> Extratropical cyclones are the everyday phenomena which, along with [[anticyclone]]s, drive the weather over much of the Earth, producing anything from cloudiness and mild [[rain|shower]]s to heavy gales and [[thunderstorm]]s.

==Terminology==
Extratropical cyclones encompass a class of storms with many names.  Although they are sometimes referred to as "[[cyclone]]s", this is imprecise; ''cyclone'' applies to numerous types of low pressure areas. The descriptor ''extratropical'' signifies that this type of cyclone generally occurs outside the tropics in the middle [[latitude]]s of Earth. The term ''mid-latitude cyclones'' may be used because of where they form; "post-tropical cyclones" if [[#Extratropical transition|extratropical transition]] has occurred.<ref name="ExtraLessonMillUni">ExtraLessonMillUni</ref><ref name="ExtratropicalPhases">{{cite web| title = Synoptic Composites of the Extratropical Transition Lifecycle of North Atlantic TCs as Defined Within Cyclone Phase Space| author = Robert Hart and Jenni Evans| publisher = [http://ams.confex.com/ American Meteorological Society]| date = 2003 | url = http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/70524.pdf| accessdate = 2006-10-03 }}</ref> Weather forecasters and the general public often describe them as "depressions" or "lows".

Extratropical cyclones are classified mainly as [[baroclinity|baroclinic]], because they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint [[gradient]] known as [[weather fronts|frontal zones]]. They can become [[barotropic]] late in their life cycle, when the distribution of heat around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with its radius.

Extratropical cyclones form anywhere within the extratropical regions of the Earth (usually between 30<U+00B0> and 60<U+00B0> [[latitude]] from the [[equator]]), either through cyclogenesis or extratropical transition. A study of extratropical cyclones in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] shows that between the 30th and 70th parallels, there are an average of 37 cyclones in existence during any 6-hour period.<ref name="VarSouthCyc"> {{cite web

===Cyclogenesis===
{{main|Cyclogenesis}}

Extratropical cyclones form along linear bands of temperature/dewpoint gradient with significant vertical [[wind shear]], and are thus classified as [[baroclinic cyclone]]s. Initially, [[cyclogenesis]], or low pressure formation, occurs along [[Surface weather analysis|frontal zones]] near a favorable quadrant of a maximum in the [[Jetstream|upper level jetstream]] known as a jet streak, usually being the right rear and left front quadrants, where [[divergence]] ensues. This causes air to rush out from the top of the air column which in turn forces [[convergence]] in the low-level wind field and increased upward motion within the column. The increased upward motion causes surface pressures to lower as the upward air motion counteracts gravity, lessening the weight of the atmosphere ([[atmospheric pressure|surface pressure]]) in that location, and thus strengthening the [[cyclone]]. As the cyclone strengthens, the cold front sweeps towards the [[equator]] and moves around the back of the cyclone. Meanwhile, its associated [[warm front]] progresses more slowly, as the cooler air ahead of the system is [[density|denser]], and therefore more difficult to dislodge.  Later, the cyclones [[occlusion|occlude]] as the poleward portion of the cold front overtakes a section of the warm front, forcing a tongue, or trowal, of warm air aloft. Eventually, the cyclone will become barotropically cold and begin to weaken.

A rapidly-falling [[atmospheric pressure]] is possible due to strong upper level forces on the system, and when pressures fall more than 1&nbsp;millibar (0.029&nbsp;inHg) per hour, such a cyclone is sometimes referred to as a bomb.<ref name="BombNWAtlantic">{{cite web

===Extratropical transition===
[[Image:ETS Florence 2006.jpg|thumb|Cyclone Florence in the north Atlantic after completing its transition to an extratropical cyclone from a hurricane]]
[[Tropical cyclone]]s often transform into extratropical cyclones at the end of their tropical existence, usually between 30<U+00B0> and 40<U+00B0> latitude, where there is sufficient [[Earth's atmosphere (Meteorology)|forcing]] from upper-level troughs or shortwaves riding the [[Westerlies]] for the process of extratropical transition to begin.  During extratropical transition, the cyclone begins to tilt back into the colder airmass with height, and the cyclone's primary energy source converts from the release of latent [[heat of condensation|heat from condensation]] (from thunderstorms near the center) to baroclinic processes. The low pressure system eventually loses its warm core and becomes a cold-core system. During this process, a cyclone in extratropical transition (known in [[Canada]] as the post-tropical stage)<ref name="CanHurrCenterGlossary">{{cite web

Due to this, the size of the system will usually appear to increase, while the core weakens. However, after transition is complete, the storm may re-strengthen due to baroclinic energy, depending on the environmental conditions surrounding the system. The cyclone will also distort in shape, becoming less symmetric with time.

On rare occasions, an extratropical cyclone can transit into a tropical cyclone if it reaches an area of ocean with warmer waters and an environment with less vertical wind shear. The peak time of [[Subtropical cyclone|subtropical]] cyclogenesis (the midpoint of this transition) is in the months of September and October, when the difference between the temperature of the air aloft and the [[sea surface temperature]] is the greatest, leading to the greatest potential for instability.<ref name="HistSubTropCyclones">{{cite web

=== Surface pressure/Wind distribution ===
[[Image:Quikscatcyclone.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|[[QuikSCAT]] image of typical extratropical cyclones over the ocean. Note the maximum winds are on the outside of the occlusion.]]
The windfield of an extratropical cyclone constricts with distance in relation to surface level pressure, with the lowest pressure being found near the center, and the highest winds typically just on the cold/poleward side of warm fronts, occlusions, and [[cold front]]s, where the [[pressure gradient force]] is highest.<ref name="ww2010PGF">{{cite web

The wind flow around a large cyclone is [[clockwise and counterclockwise|counterclockwise]] in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern hemisphere, due to the [[Coriolis effect]] (this manner of rotation is generally referred to as ''cyclonic''). Near this center, the pressure gradient force (from the pressure at the center of the cyclone compared to the pressure outside the cyclone) and the Coriolis force must be in an approximate balance for the cyclone to avoid collapsing in on itself as a result of the difference in pressure. The central pressure of the cyclone will lower with increasing  maturity, while outside of the cyclone, the [[sea-level pressure]] is not very low; its typical value is around 1,013&nbsp;millibars (29.92&nbsp;inHg), which is the average sea level pressure for Earth. In most extratropical cyclones, the part of the cold front ahead of the cyclone will develop into a warm front, giving the frontal zone (as drawn on [[Surface weather analysis|surface weather maps]]) a wave-like shape. Due to their appearance on satellite images, extratropical cyclones can also be referred to as frontal waves early in their life cycle. In the [[United States]], an old name for such a system is "warm wave".<ref name="GlobalAverageSLP">{{cite web

Once a cyclone occludes, a '''tr'''ough '''o'''f '''w'''arm air '''al'''oft, or "trowal" for short, will be caused by strong southerly winds on its eastern periphery rotating aloft around its northeast, and ultimately northwestern, periphery (also known as the warm conveyor belt), forcing a surface trough to continue into the cold sector on a similar curve to the occluded front. The trowal creates the portion of an occluded cyclone known as its '''comma head''', due to the [[comma (punctuation)|comma]]-like shape of the mid-tropospheric cloudiness that accompanies the feature. It can also be the focus of locally heavy precipitation, with thunderstorms possible if the atmosphere along the trowal is unstable enough for convection.<ref name="TROW">{{cite web

===Norwegian cyclone model===
Of the two theories on extratropical cyclone structure and life cycle, the oldest is the Norwegian Cyclone Model, developed during [[World War I]].

This model was based on oceanic cyclones and their frontal structure, as seen in surface observations and in previous projects which used [[Fixed-wing aircraft|planes]] to determine the vertical structure of fronts across the northwest Atlantic.

====Warm seclusion====
A warm seclusion is the mature phase of the extratropical cyclone lifecycle. This was conceptualized after the [[ERICA (Meteorology)|ERICA]] field experiment of the late 1980s, which produced observations of intense marine cyclones that indicated an anomalously warm low-level thermal structure, secluded (or surrounded) by a bent-back warm front and a coincident chevron-shaped band of intense surface winds.<ref name="WarmSeclusionCycMet"> {{cite web

Where an extratropical cyclone encounters another extratropical cyclone (or almost any other kind of cyclonic [[vortex]] in the atmosphere), the two may combine to become a "Binary cyclone", where the vorticies of the two cyclones rotate around each other (known as the "[[Fujiwhara effect]]"). This most often results in a merging of the two low pressure systems into a single extratropical cyclone, or can less commonly result in a mere change of direction of either one or both of the cyclones.<ref name="ExtraFujiwhara"> {{cite web

==Effects==
===General===
[[Image:Snowcsi.gif|thumb|right|250 px|Preferred region of snowfall in an extratropical cyclone]]
Extratropical cyclones can bring mild weather with a little rain and surface [[wind]]s of 15<U+2013>30&nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]] (10<U+2013>20&nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]]), or they can be cold and dangerous with torrential rain and winds exceeding 119&nbsp;km/h (74&nbsp;mph),<ref name="MarinersWeatherLog">{{cite web

The band of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] that is associated with the [[warm front]] is often extensive. In mature extratropical cyclones, an area known as the '''comma head''' on the northwest periphery of the surface low can be a region of heavy precipitation, frequent [[thunderstorm]]s, and [[thundersnow]]s. Cyclones tend to move along a predictable path at a moderate rate of progress. During [[autumn|fall]], winter, and spring, the atmosphere over continents can be cold enough through the depth of the [[troposphere]] to cause snowfall.

===Severe weather===
Squall lines, or solid bands of strong thunderstorms, can form ahead of cold fronts and [[Trough (meteorology)#Lee trough|lee trough]]s due to the presence of significant atmospheric moisture and strong upper level divergence, leading to [[hail]] and high winds.<ref name="SquallLines"> {{cite web

Explosive development of extratropical cyclones can be sudden. The storm known in the UK as the "[[Great Storm of 1987]]" deepened to 953&nbsp;millibars (28.14&nbsp;inHg) with a highest recorded wind of 220&nbsp;km/h (137&nbsp;mph), resulting in the loss of 19 lives, 15 million trees, widespread damage to homes and an estimated economic cost of [[pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]1.2&nbsp;billion ([[United States dollar|US$]]2.3&nbsp;billion).<ref name="MetoGreatStorm87"> {{cite web

Although most tropical cyclones that become extratropical quickly dissipate or are absorbed by another weather system, they can still retain winds of hurricane or gale force. In 1954, [[Hurricane Hazel]] became extratropical over [[North Carolina]] as a strong Category 3 storm. The [[Columbus Day Storm of 1962]], which evolved from the remains of Typhoon Freda, caused heavy damage in [[Oregon]] and [[Washington]], with widespread damage equivalent to at least a Category 3. In 2005, [[Hurricane Wilma]] began to lose tropical characteristics while still sporting Category 3-force winds (and became fully extratropical as a Category 1 storm).

==Historic storms==
A violent storm during the [[Crimean War]] on [[November 14]] [[1854]] wrecked 30 vessels, and sparked initial investigations into meteorology and forecasting in Europe. In the United States, the [[Columbus Day Storm of 1962]] led to [[Oregon]]'s lowest measured pressure of 965.5&nbsp;[[pascal (unit)|hPa]] (28.51&nbsp;inHg), violent winds, and US$170 million in damage (1964 dollars).<!-- following needs moving to cite system per rest of page --><ref>George Taylor and Raymond R.
