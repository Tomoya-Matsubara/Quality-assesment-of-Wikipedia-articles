The '''''Amagi'' class''' were [[battlecruiser]]s planned for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] as part of the so-called "[[Eight-eight fleet]]". The class was to have been composed of four ships: {{Ship|Japanese battlecruiser|Amagi||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}}, ''Atago'', and ''Takao''. The first three were named for mountains ([[Mount Amagi]], [[Mount Akagi]] and [[Mount Atago]]), while the fourth was named for the town [[Kaohsiung|Takao]],  [[Taiwan|Formosa]] (present-day Kaohsiung, Taiwan).<!-- This is also sourced to Conway's p. 235, add an additional citation here if desired --> The ''Amagi'' design was essentially an enlarged version of the {{sclass|Tosa|battleship|0}}<!--changed this from ''Kaga''-class--> battleship, but with a thinner armored belt and deck and a modified secondary [[Artillery battery|battery]] arrangement.<ref name="Conways235">Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 235</ref> 

Limitations imposed by the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]] prevented the class from being completed as designed. However, the treaty had a limited allowance for hulls already under construction to be converted into [[aircraft carrier]]s. ''Amagi'' and ''Akagi'' were both intended for conversion, but an earthquake damaged the hull of ''Amagi'' so extensively that the ship was scrapped. ''Akagi'' was refitted as an aircraft carrier and served with distinction during [[World War II]] as part of the ''[[Kido Butai]]'' before being sunk at the [[Battle of Midway]].

==Design==
===Dimensions and machinery===
The ships had a planned displacement of {{convert|41217|t|LT ST|lk=on}} and {{convert|47000|t|LT ST|abbr=on}} at a full load. The class design was 820&nbsp;ft 3&nbsp;in (250&nbsp;m) long at the [[Length at the waterline|waterline]], and 826&nbsp;ft 1&nbsp;in (251.8&nbsp;m) [[Length overall|overall]]. The ships would have had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of 101&nbsp;ft (30.8&nbsp;m) and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of 31&nbsp;ft (9.5&nbsp;m)<ref name="Conways235" /> and would have used 4 propeller shafts, powered by Gihon [[Steam turbine|turbines]]. The design staff intended to use turbine engines, which were to be powered by 19 Kampon [[water-tube boiler]]s, eleven of which were oil-fired, while the other eight were to have mixed oil and coal for fuel. This system was designed to provide {{convert|131200|shp|lk=in}} for a top speed of {{convert|30|knots|km/h mph|lk=in}}. The planned fuel stores amounted to 3,900&nbsp;tons of oil and 2,500&nbsp;tons of coal. The ships had a planned cruising speed of {{convert|14|knots|km/h mph}}, and with full fuel stores, the ships would have had a maximum range of {{convert|8000|nmi|km mi|lk=in}}.<ref name="Conways235" />

===Armament===
The ships were to be equipped with a main battery of ten 16&nbsp;in (406&nbsp;mm) L/45<ref group=A>L/45 denotes the length of the gun barrels; in this case, the gun is 45 [[Calibers#Caliber_as_measurement_of_length|calibers]], meaning that the gun is 45 times long as it is in diameter.</ref> guns in five twin [[Gun turret|turrets]], although an L/50 gun tested in 1920 might have been implemented instead. The guns fired 2,205 lb (1,000&nbsp;kg) [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing projectiles]] with a 494 lb (224&nbsp;kg) [[propellant]] charge at 2,592&nbsp;ft/s (790&nbsp;m/s), at a [[rate of fire]] between 1.5 to 2.5&nbsp;rounds per minute. Each gun had 90 rounds and an approximate barrel life of 250<U+2013>300 shots. The turrets would have been arranged along the centerline: two superfiring turrets fore, and three in line aft of the [[superstructure]]. The gun turrets weighed 1,004&nbsp;tons (1,020&nbsp;mt), and allowed for depression of <U+2212>5&nbsp;degrees and [[Elevation (ballistics)|elevation]] of 30&nbsp;degrees.<ref>{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | title = Japanese 41 cm/45 (16.1") 3rd Year Type, 40 cm/45 (16.1") 3rd Year Type | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNJAP_161-45_3ns.htm | publisher = Navweaps.com | date = 19 April 2007 | accessdate = 18 January 2009 }}</ref>

The secondary battery was to have consisted of sixteen 5.5&nbsp;in (140&nbsp;mm) L/50 guns mounted in [[casemate]]s along the center of the ship. These guns fired 83.8&nbsp;lb (38.0&nbsp;kg) projectiles and used 22.8&ndash;24.2&nbsp;lb (10.33&ndash;10.97&nbsp;kg) of propellant at a [[muzzle velocity]] of 2,789&ndash;2,805&nbsp;ft/s (850&ndash;855&nbsp;m/s). The guns had a maximum elevation of 25&nbsp;degrees, which enabled a maximum range of {{convert|19140|yards|mi km}}.<ref>{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | title = Japanese 5.5"/50 (14 cm) 3rd Year Type  | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNJAP_55-50_3ns.htm | publisher = Navweaps.com | date = 23 August 2007 | accessdate = 18 January 2009 }}</ref> Four, later increased to six, 4.7&nbsp;in (120&nbsp;mm) L/45 anti-aircraft guns were to have been mounted amidships, along with eight 24&nbsp;in (610&nbsp;mm) above-water torpedo tubes.<ref name="Conways235" />

===Armor===
It was planned that the ''Amagi'' class would be protected by a [[Belt armor|main belt]] 10&nbsp;in (254&nbsp;mm) thick, sloped at 12&nbsp;degrees, and a [[torpedo bulkhead]] 2.875&nbsp;in (73&nbsp;mm) thick. The main battery [[barbette]]s were designed to have between 9 and 11&nbsp;in (229&ndash;280&nbsp;mm) of armor plating, and the [[conning tower]] would have had armor ranging in thickness from 3&nbsp;in (76&nbsp;mm) to a maximum of 14&nbsp;in (356&nbsp;mm). Deck armor was to have been 3.875&nbsp;in (98&nbsp;mm) thick.<ref name="Conways235" />

== Background ==
Experiences in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] convinced naval war planners that more fast capital ships were needed, so on 4 April 1907, the [[Imperial Defence Council]] approved an [[Eight-eight fleet|"Eight-eight"]] policy. This plan originally called for a fleet of eight [[battleship]]s and eight [[armored cruiser]]s that would all be under ten years old (later changed to eight [[battlecruiser]]s and reduced to eight years old). However, the advent of the [[dreadnought]] battleship crippled this plan at the beginning; given Japan's weak and underdeveloped economy and the enormous strain that had been put on it during the Russo-Japanese War (Japan emerged from the war victorious, but bankrupt),<ref name="Conway's222">Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 222</ref> the launch of [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']] was a "disaster" for Japan.<ref name="Conway's223">Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 223</ref>

In 1907, Japan was halfway to the eight-eight, with two newly delivered battleships (the {{Sclass|Katori|battleship|4}}) in the fleet and two more (the {{Sclass|Satsuma|battleship|4}}) and four armored cruisers authorized or under construction. In addition, three more battleships and four armored cruisers had been authorized, though not funded. However, naval technology was changing; older battleships, including all of Japan's battleships in commission or under construction,<ref group=A>While the {{Sclass|Satsuma|battleship|2}}s were technically "semi-dreadnoughts" due to their heavy secondary battery, they were still made obsolete by ''Dreadnought''.</ref> were quickly rendered obsolete with the commissioning of HMS ''Dreadnought'' (hence the terms dreadnought and [[pre-dreadnought]]), and armored cruisers were seemingly useless in the face of the new battlecruisers being laid down by Great Britain and Germany. The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) recognized this, and proposed in 1909 that two battlecruisers be ordered from British plans, with one to be built in Great Britain and one to be built at home. These two ships became the {{Sclass|Kong<U+014D>|battlecruiser|4}}.<ref name="Conway's223"/>

In 1910, there was still authorization for one battleship and four armored cruisers. This battleship, a more heavily armored version of the ''Kongo''-class battlecruisers, became Japan's first [[super-dreadnought]], [[Japanese battleship Fus<U+014D>|''Fus<U+014D>'']]. With these ships, Japan appeared to be getting closer to the eight-eight goal; however, these new ships represented a "new level of naval strength" for the IJN, and they made all previous Japanese capital ships obsolete. This meant that any naval planner aiming for an eight-eight fleet would have to call for seven more battleships and four more battlecruisers<ref name="Conway's223"/> at a time when Japan was trying to weather a worldwide economic depression.<ref name="Conway's222"/>

After proposals from the IJN in 1911 and 1912 for massive shipbuilding programs, the Cabinet compromised down to a "four-four" plan; under this, three new battleships and no new battlecruisers were authorized.<ref>Gardiner and Gray (1984), pp. 222&ndash;223</ref> The Navy did not agree, and instead called for an "eight-four" fleet, while the Imperial Defence Council called for the original eight-eight. The Cabinet relented, and by July 1914, it was decided to aim first for an eight-four fleet, followed by the eight-eight fleet. The eight-four plan was presented to the [[Diet of Japan]] in 1915; it aimed to have the eight battleships and four battlecruisers by 1923 with the building of two {{Sclass|Nagato|battleship|0}} and two {{Sclass|Tosa|battleship|2}}s. The problem with this was that the old plan intended all of the ships of the eight-eight fleet to be under eight years old; by the time these new ships were completed, ''Fus<U+014D>'' and the first two ''Kongo'' ships would be past their replacement age.<ref name="Conway's224">Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 224</ref>

The plan was ultimately approved in 1917, along with funding for two battlecruisers which became the ''Amagi'' class. In late 1917, the Navy proposed to expand the eight-four plan by adding two more battlecruisers; this was approved, and two more ''Amagi''-class ships were ordered. However, having eight 16&nbsp;in (406&nbsp;mm) gun ships (four battleships and four battlecruisers) on order put an enormous financial strain on Japan, which was spending about a third of its national budget on the Navy. The massive size and scale of its building program was rapidly driving up the cost of naval construction and armament.<ref name="Conway's224"/>

==Construction, cancellation, and conversion==
[[File:Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi 1925.jpg|thumb|left|240px|''Akagi'' after her launch in April 1925; she had already been converted to an aircraft carrier|alt=A large ship, covered with scaffolding, sits in harbor under a large gantry.]]

{{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}} was the first ship of the class to be laid down; construction began on 6 December 1920 at the naval yard in [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]]. ''Amagi'' followed ten days later at the [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]] naval yard. The projected completion dates for the first pair of ships were December and November 1923, respectively. ''Atago'' was laid down in [[Kobe]] at the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] shipyard on 22 November 1921, and was projected to be finished in December 1924. ''Takao'', the fourth and final ship of the class, was laid down at the [[Mitsubishi]] shipyard in [[Nagasaki]] on 19 December 1921, and was also projected to be completed in December 1924.<ref name="Conways235" />

The [[Washington Naval Treaty]], signed in February 1922, greatly reduced the tonnage allowed for capital ships in the signatory nations. The treaty also instituted a moratorium on new warship construction; battlecruisers canceled under this included one class each from Japan, the United States, and Great Britain: the ''Amagi'' class, the {{Sclass|Lexington|battlecruiser|4}} and the {{Sclass2|G3|battlecruiser|4}}, respectively.<ref>See: [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Washington_Naval_Treaty,_1922#SECTION_II_REPLACEMENT_AND_SCRAPPING_OF_CAPITAL_SHIPS Washington Naval Treaty, Chapter II, Part III, Section II]</ref> The treaty did allow for battleship and battlecruiser hulls currently under construction to be converted into aircraft carriers, but only if these new carriers were kept under a 27,000-ton limit. Considering that the ''Amagi'' class were designed to displace {{convert|47000|t|LT ST|abbr=on}} at full load in their battlecruiser configuration,<ref name=Conways235/> this would have been a rather difficult displacement to obtain. However, the Americans also had the same problem when designing a conversion of their ''Lexington'' class, so an exception, spearheaded by US [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.]], was added to the treaty that gave the five signatories the option of converting up to two capital ships that were under construction to 33,000-ton aircraft carriers.<ref>Friedman (1983), p. 43</ref><ref>See: [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Washington_Naval_Treaty,_1922#Article_IX Washington Naval Treaty, Chapter I, Article IX]</ref> This resulted in the United States and Japan quickly reordering two ships each; Japan chose ''Amagi'' and ''Akagi'', the two most complete ships of the class, for conversion. ''Atago'' and ''Takao'' were canceled on 31 July 1924, and broken up for scrap that year.<ref name="Conways235" />

In 1923 the [[1923 Great Kant<U+014D> earthquake|Great Kant<U+014D> earthquake]] in Tokyo caused significant stress damage to the hull of ''Amagi''. The structure was too heavily damaged to be usable, and conversion work was abandoned. ''Amagi'' was stricken from the navy list and sold for scrapping, which began on 14 April 1924.<ref name="Conways235" /> The incomplete {{sclass|Tosa|battleship|2}} [[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|''Kaga'']], on which work had stopped on 5 February 1922, was reordered as a carrier to replace ''Amagi''.<ref>Gardiner and Gray eds. (1984), p. 232</ref>

===''Akagi''{{'}}s career as an aircraft carrier===

The conversion of ''Akagi'' began on 19 November 1923, and was completed in March 1927. However, the strange assortment of flight decks fitted on ''Akagi''<U+2014>a main landing deck superimposed over two short take-off decks<U+2014>proved unsatisfactory, and the ship was withdrawn from active service in 1935 for modernization. The lower two flight decks were removed, the main deck was lengthened to 817&nbsp;ft (249&nbsp;m), and a third elevator was added.<ref name="Stille12">Stille, p. 12</ref> Refitting was completed in 1938.<ref name="Kotani32-33">Kotani, Ken.

On 19 February 1942, aircraft from ''Akagi'', ''Hiry<U+016B>'', ''S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>'', and ''Kaga'' participated in the [[Bombing of Darwin|bombing of Darwin, Australia]].<ref name="Ireland190"/><ref>Hoyt (2001), p. 260</ref> On 27 February, their bombers severely damaged the old American carrier {{USS|Langley|CV-1|6}}, which was subsequently scuttled by her escort.<ref>{{cite DANFS|title=Langley|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/l3/langley-i.htm|accessdate=6 October 2009|dateformat=dmy}}</ref>

''Akagi'' and the carriers ''Hiry<U+016B>'' and ''S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>'' were sent in March 1942 with a mixed force of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers to the Indian Ocean to engage the British fleet there and to support planned attacks on [[Ceylon]]. In the [[Easter Sunday Raid]] on 5 April, aircraft from the carriers struck the British base at [[Colombo]], destroying a number of aircraft and sinking an armed merchant cruiser and the old destroyer [[HMS Tenedos (H04)|HMS ''Tenedos'']]  in the harbor.<ref name="Ireland190"/><ref>Hoyt (2001), p. 268</ref> The Japanese fleet also spotted the heavy cruisers {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|6}} and {{HMS|Cornwall|56|6}} at sea; both ships were sunk in an overwhelming air attack.<ref name="Ireland190"/> On 9 April the carriers attacked British installations at [[Trincomalee]], destroying aircraft and sinking the carrier {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}}, the destroyer {{HMAS|Vampire|D68|6}}, and the corvette {{HMS|Hollyhock|K64|6}}.<ref>Ireland (1998), p. 191</ref>

In late May 1942, in an effort to draw out and destroy the elusive American carriers, Japanese forces organized for attacks on the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|Aleutian Islands]] in Alaska  and [[Battle of Midway|Midway Atoll]] in the Western Pacific.<ref name="Ireland197">Ireland (1998), p. 197</ref> Nagumo, aboard ''Akagi'', led ''Kaga'', ''S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>'', and ''Hiry<U+016B>'' and the support ships of the First Carrier Striking Force to Midway.<ref>Love, Robert.
