"'''The Unforgettable Fire'''" is a song by rock band [[U2]]. The fourth song on their 1984 album ''[[The Unforgettable Fire]]'', it was released as the album's second single in April 1985. The band cite an art exhibition by victims of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] that was held at the Peace Museum in Chicago as inspiration for the song. It became the band's third Top 10 hit in the [[UK]], reaching #6 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and #8 on the Dutch singles chart, but it was yet to break them into the [[U.S.]] 

The song, like many tracks from ''The Unforgettable Fire'', is an atmospheric composition, with [[ambient music|ambient]] use of guitar and a string arrangement by Irish jazz musician [[Noel Kelehan]].

==History==
[[Image:UnforgettableFire23Sep2009.jpg|thumb|left|Lighting and video effects for the performance of "The Unforgettable Fire" on the [[U2 360<U+00B0> Tour]].]]
"The Unforgettable Fire" was composed at a time when [[Bono]] had been reading the work of poet [[Paul Celan]], whose line "poetry is a sort of homecoming." Celan's profound spiritual doubt contrasts with U2 members' previous religious certainties, and the song's line "on borderlands we run...and don't look back" suggests the band is more comfortable with the contradictions between rock and his religious beliefs.<ref>* {{cite book| last = Graham| first = Bill| coauthors = can Oosten de Beer, Caroline| title = U2: The Complete Guide to their Music| publisher = Omnibus Press| year = 2004| location = London| isbn =  0-7119-9886-8| pages =23-24}}</ref>
