==Reception==
The [[Allmusic]] review by [[ Scott Yanow]] awarded the album 4<U+00BD> stars stating "It is only fitting that Hank Mobley would record one of the last worthwhile Blue Note albums before its artistic collapse (it would not be revived until the 1980s) for his consistent output helped define the label's sound in the 1960s".<ref name="Allmusic">Yanow, S.
