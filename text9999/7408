'''''Rhythm Killers''''' is the second [[studio album]] by Jamaican musical duo [[Sly and Robbie]], released in May 1987 on [[Island Records]]. After their prolific output in [[reggae]], the duo experimented with [[electronic music|electronic]] sounds and contemporary recording technology, while branching out into international, [[fusion (music)|cross-genre]] endeavors during the 1980s. For the album, they enlisted record producer and mentor [[Bill Laswell]] and recorded with an ensemble of musicians at Quad Recording in New York City. Along with their live instruments, Sly and Robbie used electronic recording equipment such as the [[Fairlight CMI]] synthesizer and [[electronic drum]]s.

A [[funk]] and [[electronic dance music|dance]] album, ''Rhythm Killers'' has a dense sound that incorporates [[contrast (music)|contrasting]] musical elements and disparate styles, including reggae, [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[hard rock]], [[worldbeat]], and [[downtown music]]. Arranged in two side-long gapless [[suite (music)|suites]], the album's songs are characterized by electronic [[groove (music)|grooves]], striking beats, improvisational rhythms, string synthesizers, and [[Cross-beat|cross-rhythms]] produced by turntable [[scratching|scratches]], African and Latin-influenced percussion, and percussive [[rapping|raps]]. The album has been noted by music writers for its electronic rhythms, treatment of [[African-American music]] elements, and Laswell's densely [[multitrack recording|layered]] production.

The album [[record chart|charted]] in four countries, including the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number 35 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It was promoted with two [[single (music)|singles]], including the UK hit "Boops (Here to Go)". Upon its release, ''Rhythm Killers'' received positive reviews from music critics, who found its music interesting and praised the duo's take on funk and dance styles. It was ranked in year-end albums lists by critics such as ''[[NME]]'' and [[Robert Christgau]], who named it the seventh best album of 1987. Encouraged by its success, Sly and Robbie continued their digital direction on subsequent albums. The album is currently [[out of print]].

In an effort to [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] with music listeners outside of reggae's market, Sly and Robbie heightened their experimentation with other musical sounds, particularly funk and occasional [[hip hop music]].<ref name="CM"/> Despite his eclectic output, Laswell himself had started out as a bass player in funk groups, an experience that inspired him to compose his musical arrangements with a rhythmic foundation.<ref name="Palmer">{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Palmer (writer)|date=2 August 1987|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/02/arts/recordings-arriving-at-funk-from-two-directions.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|title=Recordings; Arriving at Funk from Two Directions|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2012-08-13|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AhMxxhYm|archivedate=2012-09-15|deadurl=no}}</ref> Dunbar explained their approach for the album in an interview for ''[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]'' at the time, saying that "We're trying to get new fans.

So we cut two tracks and extended them, each [[A-side and B-side|side]] consisting of three songs. Non-stop dancing, that's the idea."<ref name="Taylor"/> 

In the early stage of recording, Sly and Robbie focused primarily on constructing difficult [[groove (music)|grooves]] for songs.<ref name="Perna"/> To record their rhythm tracks, Dunbar worked in the studio alone and [[Cut (music)|cut]] a drum part without having a melody in mind.<ref name="Perna"/> He recounted his approach for the album to ''Musician'', saying that "I just played what I felt, working from a sense of 'now I'll do 103 beats per minute.'

Sometimes I'll change the [[drum beat|drum pattern]] to a bass line and Sly will play the [[bassline|bass line]] on the drums."<ref name="Perna"/> Along with live percussion, Dunbar played [[Simmons (electronic drum company)|Simmons drums]], and the duo integrated contemporary electronic music technology such as the Fairlight CMI synthesizer in the album's recording.<ref name="Taylor"/><ref name="liner"/> Dunbar used his recorded live drums to trigger the synthesizer's sampled drum sounds.<ref name="Perna"/>

''Rhythm Killers'' was well received by contemporary music critics.<ref name="CM"/> Gavin Edwards of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described it as "a thirty-five-minute dance party full of surprises and strange noises", and commented that it "sounds like the Great Missing [[disc jockey|DJ]] Set <U+2014> albeit one played by live musicians with perfect telepathy."<ref name="Edwards">{{cite journal|title=Review: Rhythm Killers|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|location=New York|page=114|year=1987|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20081121002029/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/slyandrobbie/albums/album/104221/review/6185297/rhythm_killers|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Ahyu01nF|archivedate=2012-09-15|deadurl=no}}</ref> Simon Witter of ''[[i-D]]'' dubbed it "the year's most enjoyable, perfectly formed dance album."<ref name="Witter">{{cite journal|last=Witter|first=Simon|month=May|year=1987|title=Sly & Robbie: Musclefunk Throwdown|journal=[[i-D]]|location=London}}</ref> ''[[Stereo Review]]'' praised the duo's take on "contemporary urban dance music", calling it "one of the best dance records I've heard in a very long time", and wrote that they "demonstrate how the best of the past can be combined with current modes to produce music that is both imaginative and readily accessible."<ref name="Stereo">{{cite journal|author=P.G.|month=September|year=1987|title=Sly and Robbie: Rhythm Killers|journal=[[Stereo Review]]|volume=52|issue=7<U+2013>12|pages=102<U+2013>104}}</ref> Steve Hochman of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' preferred the album to the "serious" tone of ''Language Barrier'' and commented that "this time the fun is as whoppingly big as the beat".<ref name="Hochman">{{cite news|last=Hochman|first=Steve|date=12 July 1987|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-12/entertainment/ca-3331_1_big-fun|title=Big Funk, Big Fun|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2012-08-13|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AhNQWP21|archivedate=2012-09-15|deadurl=no}}</ref> Hochman cited it as "one of the most stunning albums of funk<U+2014>or just about any style<U+2014>this year" and stated, "Sly and Robbie have squeezed onto one slab of vinyl the best of the past 20 years of funk, from [[Sly and the Family Stone|Sly & the Family Stone]] through [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], along the way throwing in reggae, rap and even a bit of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]."<ref name="Hochman"/>

Mat Smith of ''[[Melody Maker]]'' gave the album a rave review and found it to be "enthused and fused with a ... schizophrenic art of noise attack all lashed around a nonstop rhythm that bumps each track nose to tail tight."<ref name="Smith">{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Mat|date=30 May 1987|title=Review: Rhythm Killer|journal=[[Melody Maker]]|location=London}}</ref> ''[[The Washingtonian (magazine)|The Washingtonian]]'' called it a "minor masterpiece" and wrote that its disparate styles are "distilled and mixed to pulsing perfection."<ref name="Washingtonian"/> [[Ken Tucker]] of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' commented that Sly and Robbie "long ago proved their mastery in the reggae genre, but here they tackle funk music and perform it well."<ref>{{cite news|last=Tucker|first=Ken|authorlink=Ken Tucker|date=3 May 1987|url=http://articles.philly.com/1987-05-03/entertainment/26161828_1_ultimate-collection-songs-cult-jam|title=Tom Petty, With Rougher Edges|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|accessdate=2012-08-14|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AhNSTl4B|archivedate=2012-09-15|deadurl=no}}</ref> ''[[The Nation]]'' commended them for assembling "top-notch players to thread through long, driving meditations a riot of sounds from [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]]."<ref>{{cite journal|month=December|year=1987|title=Our Holiday Lists|journal=[[The Nation]]|location=New York|volume=245}}</ref> In his consumer guide for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', Robert Christgau gave it an A rating,<ref name="Christgau">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|date=2 June 1987|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv6-87.php|title=Consumer Guide|newspaper=The Village Voice|location=New York|accessdate=2012-08-11|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AhNVIwpn|archivedate=2012-09-15|deadurl=no}}</ref> indicating "a great record both of whose sides offer enduring pleasure and surprise.

In a negative review, Greg Taylor of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' criticized the album's music as "wallpaper" and "a mind-numbing waste of talent", writing that "the fabled balance of the two players is buried under the flashy hip-hop mix".<ref name="Taylor"/> John Leland of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' called it "an ambitious and impressively successful dialogue on the crosscultural elasticity of the funk", but was ambivalent towards its "genre music", which he viewed lacked "gusto", and commented that the album "looks beyond funk to a rad thesis; by my ears it never gets beyond its thesis and into the funk."<ref name="Leland"/> Robert Palmer of ''[[The New York Times]]'' critiqued that "the insight that funk is the [[wikt:Rosetta Stone|Rosetta Stone]] of contemporary dance music is a worthy one, but it doesn't necessarily follow that everything deriving from funk needs to be crammed into every tune."<ref name="Palmer"/> Although he perceived an excess of effects "clutter[ing] what undoubtedly began as eloquent, unadorned Sly and Robbie rhythm tracks", Palmer praised the album's "simplest" moments as "ingenious" and wrote in conclusion, "despite its tendency toward overkill, [the album] contains enough fresh ideas, and captivating grooves, to repay repeated listening."<ref name="Palmer"/>
