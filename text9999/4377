===Election adverts===
As of [[April]] [[2008]], Channel S (including other Bengali channels) was under investigation by [[Ofcom]] for a breach of the [[Communications Act 2003]], after airing election adverts for the [[Liberal Democrats]] just days before the [[London mayoral election, 2008]]. The adverts were running on the channel from [[18 April]] [[2008]]. The channel was persuaded by the Lib Dem candidate, Jalal Rajonuddin who is a well respected leader in the community, to broadcast adverts for his candidacy. Under the act you cannot air election adverts as opposed to election broadcasts. The Liberal Democrats took full responsibility and said it will pay the necessary fines, and has given an apology.<ref>[http://www.respectrenewal.org/content/view/274/72/ Respect Renewal]</ref>
