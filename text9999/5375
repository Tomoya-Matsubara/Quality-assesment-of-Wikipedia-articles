al-Kharrat has been described as "one of Egypt's most influential fiction writers"<ref>[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/886/cu4.htm "Edwar Al-Kharrat: poet of the Arabic novel", ''Al-Ahram Weekly'', 28 Feb-5 Mar 2008]</ref> and "one of the most important writers in the Arab world".<ref>[http://www.aljadid.com/content/edwar-al-kharrat-and-modernist-revolution-egyptian-novel "Edwar al-Kharrat and the Modernist Revolution in the Egyptian Novel", ''Al-Jadid'' magazine (Vol. 2, no. 9, July 1996)]</ref> He was a leading figure among the group of Egyptian writers known as the [[Sixties Generation]], and founded and edited the literary journal ''[[Gallery 68]]'', considered to be the mouthpiece of that generation.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pewdETYrR6IC ''The Arabic Novel'' by Hamdi Sakkut, translated by Roger Monroe, AUC Press, Cairo, Egypt, 2000, p.45]</ref> In this role, al-Kharrat promoted and disseminated the works of such writers as [[Sonallah Ibrahim]], [[Bahaa Taher]], [[Ibrahim Aslan]], [[Yahya Taher Abdullah]], and [[Gamal al-Ghitani]].

Also in 1979, his first novel ''[[Rama and the Dragon]]'' was published to widespread critical acclaim. A "daringly experimental" work, ''Rama'' has been called "a breakthrough for the Arab novel".<ref>[http://www.aljadid.com/content/edwar-al-kharrat-and-modernist-revolution-egyptian-novel ''Al-Jadid'', 1996]</ref> al-Kharrat himself described the novel as "untranslatable", although an English translation was completed by [[Ferial Ghazoul]] and [[John Verlenden]] and published by the [[AUC Press]] in 2002<ref>[http://www.aucpress.com/p-2732-rama-and-the-dragon.aspx ''Rama and the Dragon'', English translation by AUC Press, 2002]</ref> after winning the 1999 [[Naguib Mahfouz Medal for Literature]].
