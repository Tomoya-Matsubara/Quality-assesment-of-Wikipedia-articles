'''George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron''', later '''George Gordon Noel, 6th Baron Byron''', [[Royal Society|FRS]] (22 January 1788 <U+2013> 19 April 1824), commonly known simply as '''Lord Byron''', was an [[England|English]] poet and a leading figure in [[Romanticism]]. Amongst Byron's best-known works are the brief poems ''[[She Walks in Beauty]]'', ''When We Two Parted'', and ''[[So, we'll go no more a roving]]'', in addition to the [[narrative]] poems ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'' and ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]''. He is regarded as one of the greatest British poets and remains widely read and influential.

Byron's notability rests not only on his writings but also on his life, which featured aristocratic excesses, huge debts, numerous love affairs, and self-imposed exile. He was famously described by [[Lady Caroline Lamb]] as "mad, bad and dangerous to know".<ref>

Vice Admiral John Byron had circumnavigated the globe, and was the younger brother of the [[William Byron, 5th Baron Byron|5th Baron Byron]], known as "the Wicked Lord".

He was christened George Gordon Byron at [[St Marylebone Parish Church]] after his maternal grandfather, [[George Gordon of Gight]], a descendant of [[James I of Scotland|King James I]]. This grandfather committed [[suicide]]<ref name="nytimes 1898">

Catherine moved back to Scotland shortly afterwards, where she raised her son in [[Aberdeen]].<ref name="nytimes 1898" /> On 21 May 1798, the death of Byron's great-uncle, the "wicked" Lord Byron, made the 10-year-old the 6th Baron Byron, and the young man then inherited both title and estate, [[Newstead Abbey]], in Nottinghamshire, England. His mother proudly took him to England. Byron lived at his estate infrequently, as the Abbey was rented to [[Henry Yelverton, 19th Baron Grey de Ruthyn|Lord Grey de Ruthyn]], among others, during Byron's adolescence.

In August 1799, Byron entered the school of [[William Glennie]], an [[Aberdonian]] in [[Dulwich]].<ref>

===Name===

[[File:Lochnagar.jpg|thumb|The mountain [[Lochnagar]] is the subject of one of Byron's poems, in which he reminisces about his childhood]]

Byron's names changed throughout his life. He was christened "George Gordon Byron" in London. "Gordon" was a baptismal name, not a surname, after his maternal grandfather. In order to claim his wife's estate in Scotland, Byron's father took the additional surname "Gordon", becoming "John Byron Gordon", and he was occasionally styled "John Byron Gordon of Gight". Byron himself used this surname for a time and was registered at school in Aberdeen as "George Byron Gordon". At the age of 10, he inherited the English [[Baron Byron|Barony of Byron]], becoming "Lord Byron", and eventually dropped the double surname (though after this point his surname was hidden by his [[peerage]] in any event).

When Byron's mother-in-law died, her will required that he change his surname to "Noel" in order to inherit half her estate, and so he obtained a [[Royal Warrant]] allowing him to "take and use the surname of Noel only". The Royal Warrant also allowed him to "subscribe the said surname of Noel before all titles of honour", and from that point he signed himself "Noel Byron" (the usual signature of a peer being merely the peerage, in this case simply "Byron"). This was, it was said, so that his signature would become "N.B." which were the initials of one of his heroes, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. He was also sometimes referred to as "Lord Noel Byron", as if "Noel" were part of his title, and likewise his wife was sometimes called "Lady Noel Byron". Lady Byron eventually succeeded to the [[Baron Wentworth|Barony of Wentworth]], becoming "Lady Wentworth"; her surname before marriage had been "Milbanke".

==Early career==

While not at school or college, Byron lived with his mother at Burgage Manor in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, in some antagonism.<ref name="nytimes 1898" /> While there, he cultivated friendships with Elizabeth Pigot and her brother, John, with whom he staged two plays for the entertainment of the community.

[[File:Byronshouse266.JPG|thumb|Byron's house in [[Southwell, Nottinghamshire]]]]

During this time, with the help of Elizabeth Pigot, who copied many of his rough drafts, he was encouraged to write his first volumes of poetry. ''Fugitive Pieces'' was printed by Ridge of Newark, which contained poems written when Byron was only 14. However, it was promptly recalled and burned on the advice of his friend, the Reverend Thomas Beecher, on account of its more amorous verses, particularly the poem ''To Mary''.<ref>

''Pieces on Various Occasions'', a "miraculously chaste" revision according to Byron, was published after this.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

''Hours of Idleness'', which collected many of the previous poems, along with more recent compositions, was the culminating book. The savage, anonymous criticism this received (now known to be the work of [[Henry Peter Brougham]]) in the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' prompted his first major satire,<ref name="akstate" /> ''English Bards and Scotch Reviewers'' (1809). The work so upset some of these critics they challenged Byron to a duel; over time, in subsequent editions, it became a mark of prestige to be the target of Byron's pen.<ref name="akstate" />

After his return from his travels, the first two cantos of ''Childe Harold's Pilgrimage'' were published in 1812, and were received with acclaim.<ref name="companion">

==Personal life==
===Early love life===
[[File:2ndEarlOfClare.jpeg|thumb|[[John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare]]]]

Byron's first loves included Mary Duff and Margaret Parker, his distant cousins,<ref name="akstate" /> and Mary Chaworth, whom he met while at Harrow.<ref name="nytimes 1898" /> Byron later wrote that his passion for Duff began when he was "not [yet] eight years old," and was still remembered in 1813.<ref name="akstate" /> Byron refused to return to Harrow in September 1803 because of his love for Chaworth; his mother wrote, "He has no indisposition that I know of but love, desperate love, the worst of all maladies in my opinion. In short, the boy is distractedly in love with Miss Chaworth."<ref name="nytimes 1898" /> In Byron's later memoirs, "Mary Chaworth is portrayed as the first object of his adult sexual feelings."<ref name="McC2002">{{cite book|title=Byron: Life and Legend|last=MacCarthy|first=Fiona|page=33|isbn=978-0719556210|publisher=John Murray Publishers Ltd|date=7 Nov 2002}}</ref>

Byron returned to Harrow in January 1804,<ref name="nytimes 1898" /> to a more settled period which saw the formation of a circle of emotional involvements with other Harrow boys, which he recalled with great vividness: 'My School friendships were with ''me passions'' (for I was always violent).'<ref>MacCarthy, p.37</ref> The most enduring of those was with the [[John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare]]&nbsp;<U+2014> four years Byron's junior&nbsp;<U+2014> whom he was to meet unexpectedly many years later in Italy (1821).<ref>MacCarthy, p. 404</ref> His nostalgic poems about his Harrow friendships, ''Childish Recollections'' (1806), express a prescient "consciousness of sexual differences that may in the end make England untenable to him".<ref>MacCarthy, p. 40</ref>

<poem style="margin-left: 4em; font-style: italic;">
"Ah! Sure some stronger impulse vibrates here,
Which whispers friendship will be doubly dear
To one, who thus for kindred hearts must roam,
And seek abroad, the love denied at home."
</poem>

While at Trinity, Byron met and formed a close friendship with the younger John Edleston. About his "prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>" he wrote, "He has been my almost constant associate since October, 1805, when I entered Trinity College. His voice first attracted my attention, his countenance fixed it, and his manners attached me to him for ever." In his memory Byron composed ''Thyrza'', a series of elegies.<ref name="hudsonreview">{{cite journal|title=Bryon(sic): Revolutionary, libertine and friend|last=Allen|first=Brooke|month=Summer|year=2003|journal=The Hudson Review|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4021/is_200307/ai_n9278558|accessdate=2008-07-11}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Byron wore a ring of Edleston's for the 13 years until he died.<ref name="hudsonreview" /> In later years he described the affair as 'a violent, though ''pure'' love and passion'. This however has to be read in the context of hardening public attitudes to homosexuality in England, and the severe sanctions (including public hanging) against convicted or even suspected offenders.<ref>MacCarthy, p.61</ref> The liaison, on the other hand, may well have been 'pure' out of respect for Edleston's innocence, in contrast to the (probably) more sexually overt relations experienced at Harrow School.<ref>MacCarthy, p. 39</ref> Also while at Cambridge he formed lifelong friendships with men such as [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton|John Cam Hobhouse]] and [[Francis Hodgson]], a Fellow at King's College, with whom he corresponded on literary and other matters until the end of his life (including one of the frankest admissions of his earlier feelings for John Edleston, upon Edleston's death in 1811). {{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Although Byron had numerous relations with women, it is now known that John Murray, Byron's original publishers, had withheld compromising letters and instructed at least one major biographer (Leslie A. Marchand, 1957) to censor details of his [[bisexuality]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Another biographer, Fiona MacCarthy, has posited that Byron's true sexual yearnings were for boys.<ref name="real byron">{{cite journal|last=Bostridge|first=Mark|date=3 November 2002|title=On the trail of the real Lord Byron|journal=The Independent on Sunday|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/on-the-trail-of-the-real-lord-byron-603280.html|accessdate=2008-07-22}}</ref>

Byron racked up numerous debts as a young man, due to what his mother termed a "reckless disregard for money".<ref name="nytimes 1898" /> She lived at Newstead during this time, in fear of her son's creditors.<ref name="nytimes 1898" />

He had planned to spend early 1808 cruising with his cousin [[George Edmund Byron Bettesworth|George Bettesworth]], who was captain of the 32-gun frigate [[HMS Tartar (1801)|HMS ''Tartar'']]. Bettesworth's unfortunate death at the [[Battle of Alv<U+00F8>en]] in May 1808 made that impossible.

From 1809 to 1811, Byron went on the [[Grand Tour]], then customary for a young nobleman. The [[Napoleonic Wars]] forced him to avoid most of Europe, and he instead turned to the [[Mediterranean]]. Correspondence among his circle of Cambridge friends also suggests that a key motive was the hope of [[homosexual]] experience,<ref>

and other theories saying that he was worried about a possible dalliance with the married Mary Chatsworth, his former love (the subject of his poem from this time, "To a Lady: On Being Asked My Reason for Quitting England in the Spring").<ref name="akstate" /> Attraction to the Levant was probably a motive in itself; he had read about the Ottoman and Persian lands as a child, was attracted to Islam (especially Sufi mysticism), and later wrote, <U+201C>With these countries, and events connected with them, all my really poetical feelings begin and end."<ref>Byron Blackstone (Dec. 1974), <U+201C>Byron and Islam: the triple Eros<U+201D> (Journal of European Studies vol. 4 no. 4, pp. 325-63); Byron to Moore, 8 March 1816, in Marchand vol. 5, p. 45</ref> He travelled from England over Spain to [[Albania]] and spent time at the court of [[Ali Pasha]] of Ioannina,<ref>

}}</ref>
and in [[Athens]]. For most of the trip, he had a traveling companion in his friend [[John Cam Hobhouse]].

Byron began his trip in [[Portugal]] from where he wrote a letter to his friend Mr. Hodgson in which he describes his mastery of the Portuguese language, consisting mainly of swearing and insults. Byron particularly enjoyed his stay in [[Sintra]] that is described in [[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]] as "glorious Eden".

While in Athens, Byron met [[Nicol<U+00F2> Giraud]], who became quite close and taught him Italian. It was also presumed that the two had an intimate relationship involving a sexual affair.<ref>Christensen, Jerome (1993), Lord Byron's Strength, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press.</ref> Byron sent Giraud to school at a monastery in [[Malta]] and bequeathed him a sizeable sum of seven thousand pounds sterling. The will, however, was later cancelled.<ref>MacCarthy, p.135</ref> In 1810 in Athens Byron wrote [[Maid of Athens, ere we part (George Byron)|Maid of Athens, ere we part]] for a 12-year-old girl, Teresa Makri [1798-1875], and reportedly offered <U+00A3> 500 for her. The offer was not accepted.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Byron made his way to [[Izmir|Smyrna]] where he and Hobhhouse cadged a ride to Constantinople on [[HMS Salsette (1805)|HMS ''Salsette'']]. While ''Salsette'' was anchored  awaiting Ottoman permission to dock at the city, on 3 May 1810 Byron and Lieutenant Ekenhead, of ''Salsette''{{'}}s marines, swam the [[Hellespont]]. Byron commemorated this feat in the second canto of [[Don Juan (Byron)|''Don Juan'']].

Byron eventually broke off the relationship and moved swiftly on to others (such as that with [[Jane Elizabeth Scott|Lady Oxford]]), but Lamb never entirely recovered, pursuing him even after he tired of her. She was emotionally disturbed, and lost so much weight that Byron cruelly commented to her mother-in-law, his friend Lady Melbourne, that he was "haunted by a skeleton".<ref name="ehist net">

She began to call on him at home, sometimes dressed in disguise as a page boy,<ref name="spartandaily" /> at a time when such an act could ruin both of them socially. One day, during such a visit, she wrote on a book at his desk, "Remember me!" As a retort, Byron wrote a poem entitled ''Remember Thee! Remember Thee!'' which concludes with the line "Thou false to him, thou fiend to me".

As a child, Byron had seen little of his half-sister [[Augusta Leigh]]; in adulthood, he formed a close relationship with her that has been interpreted by some as incestuous,<ref name="ehist net" /> and by others as innocent.<ref name=akstate /> Augusta (who was married) gave birth on 15 April 1814 to her third daughter, [[Elizabeth Medora Leigh]].

Eventually Byron began to court Lady Caroline's cousin [[Anne Isabella Milbanke]] ("Annabella"), who refused his first proposal of marriage but later accepted him. Milbanke was a highly moral woman, intelligent and mathematically gifted; she was also an heiress.  They married at [[Seaham]] Hall, [[County Durham]], on 2 January 1815. The marriage proved unhappy. He treated her poorly and showed disappointment at the birth of a daughter ([[Ada Lovelace|Augusta Ada]]) rather than a son.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} On 16 January 1816, Lady Byron left him, taking Ada with her. On 21 April, Byron signed the Deed of Separation. Rumours of marital violence, adultery with actresses, incest with Augusta Leigh, and sodomy were circulated, assisted by a jealous Lady Caroline.<ref name="ehist net" /> In a letter, Augusta quoted him as saying: "Even to have such a thing said is utter destruction and ruin to a man from which he can never recover."

After this break-up of his domestic life, Byron again left England, and, as it turned out, it was forever. He passed through Belgium and continued up the [[Rhine River]]. In the summer of 1816 he settled at the [[Villa Diodati]] by [[Lake Geneva]], Switzerland, with his personal physician, the young, brilliant, and handsome [[John William Polidori]]. There Byron befriended the poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and Shelley's future wife [[Mary Shelley|Mary Godwin]]. He was also joined by Mary's stepsister, [[Claire Clairmont]], with whom he had had an affair in London. Byron initially refused to have anything to do with Claire, and would only agree to remain in her presence with the Shelleys, who eventually persuaded Byron to accept and provide for [[Allegra Byron|Allegra]], the child she bore him in January 1817.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Byron wintered in Venice, pausing his travels when he fell in love with Marianna Segati, in whose Venice house he was lodging, and who was soon replaced by 22-year-old Margarita Cogni; both women were married.<ref name="byronbook" /> Cogni could not read or write, and she left her husband to move into Byron's Venice house.<ref name="byronbook" /> Their fighting often caused Byron to spend the night in his [[gondola]]; when he asked her to leave the house, she threw herself into the Venetian canal.<ref name="byronbook" />

In 1817, he journeyed to Rome. On returning to Venice, he wrote the fourth canto of ''Childe Harold''. About the same time, he sold Newstead and published ''[[Manfred]]'', ''[[Cain (play)|Cain]]'' and ''The Deformed Transformed''. The first five cantos of ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' were written between 1818 and 1820, during which period he made the acquaintance of the young [[Teresa, Contessa Guiccioli|Countess Guiccioli]], who found her first love in Byron, who in turn asked her to elope with him.<ref name="byronbook" /> It was about this time that he received a visit from [[Thomas Moore]], to whom he confided his [[autobiography]] or "life and adventures", which Moore, Hobhouse, and Byron's publisher, John Murray,<ref name="byronbook" /> burned in 1824, a month after Byron's death.<ref name="real byron">

Byron had a child, [[Ada Lovelace|The Hon. Augusta Ada Byron]] ("Ada", later Countess of Lovelace), in 1815 with Annabella Byron, Lady Byron (''n<U+00E9>e'' Anne Isabella Milbanke, or "Annabella"), later Lady Wentworth. Ada Lovelace, notable in her own right, collaborated with [[Charles Babbage]] on the [[analytical engine]], a predecessor to modern computers.  She is recognized<ref>{{cite web | url = http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/tap/Files/ada-bio.html | accessdate = 2010-07-11 |title=Ada Byron, Lady Lovelace}}</ref> as the world's first programmer.

He also had an [[Legitimacy (law)|illegitimate]] child in 1817, [[Allegra Byron|Clara Allegra Byron]], with [[Claire Clairmont]], stepsister of [[Mary Shelley]] and stepdaughter of ''Political Justice'' and ''Caleb Williams'' writer, [[William Godwin]].

Allegra is not entitled to the style "The Hon." as is usually given to the daughter of barons, since she was illegitimate. Born in Bath in 1817, Allegra lived with Byron for a few months in Venice; he refused to allow an Englishwoman caring for the girl to adopt her, and objected to  her being raised in the Shelleys' household.<ref name="byronbook" /> He wished for her to be brought up Catholic and not marry an Englishman.<ref name="byronbook" /> He made arrangements for her to inherit 5,000 lira upon marriage, or when she reached the age of 21, provided she did not marry a native of Britain.<ref name="byronbook">

However, the girl died aged five of a fever in [[Bagna Cavallo]], Italy while Byron was in Pisa; he was deeply upset by the news.<ref name="byronbook" /> He had Allegra's body sent back to England to be buried at his old school, Harrow, because Protestants could not be buried in consecrated ground in Catholic countries.<ref name="byronbook" /> At one time he himself had wanted to be buried at Harrow. Byron was indifferent towards Allegra's mother, Claire Clairmont.<ref name="byronbook" />

Although it cannot be proved, some{{who|date=July 2010}} attest that [[Augusta Leigh]]'s child, [[Elizabeth Medora Leigh]], was fathered by Byron.

It is thought{{by whom|date=July 2010}} that Lord Byron had a son by a maid he employed at Newstead named Lucy. A letter of his to John Hanson from Newstead Abbey, dated January 17, 1809, refers to the situation: "You will discharge my Cook, & Laundry Maid, the other two I shall retain to take care of the house, more especially as the youngest is pregnant (I need not tell you by whom) and I cannot have the girl on the parish." The letter may be found in many editions of Byron's letters, such as Marchand's 1982 Byron's Letters and Journals. The poem "To My Son" may be about this child; however, the dating gives difficulties; some editors{{specify|date=July 2010}} attribute the poem to a date two years earlier than the letter.

==Political career==

Byron eventually took his seat in the [[House of Lords]] in 1811, shortly after his return from the Levant, and made his maiden speech there on 27 February 1812. A strong advocate of social reform, he received particular praise as one of the few [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliamentary]] defenders of the [[Luddites]]: specifically, he was against a [[death penalty]] for Luddite "frame breakers" in [[Nottinghamshire]], who destroyed textile machines that were putting them out of work. His first speech before the Lords was loaded with sarcastic references to the "benefits" of automation, which he saw as producing inferior material as well as putting people out of work. He said later that he "spoke very violent sentences with a sort of modest impudence", and thought he came across as "a bit theatrical".<ref name="moore life">

In another Parliamentary speech he expressed opposition to the established religion because it was unfair to people of other faiths.<ref>''Ibid'', p. 679.</ref> These experiences inspired Byron to write political poems such as ''Song for the Luddites'' (1816) and ''The Landlords' Interest'', Canto XIV of ''The Age of Bronze''.<ref>

==Life abroad==
===Reasons for his departure===

Ultimately, Byron resolved to escape the censure of British society (due to allegations of [[sodomy]] and [[incest]]) by living abroad,<ref name="real byron" /> thereby freeing himself of the need to conceal his sexual interests (MacCarthy pp.&nbsp;86, 314).<ref name="McC2002" /> Byron left England in 1816 and did not return for the last eight years of his life, even to bury his daughter.<ref name="real byron" /><ref name="byronbook" />

===The Armenians in Venice===

In 1816, Byron visited [[S. Lazzaro degli Armeni Island|Saint Lazarus Island]] in [[Venice]] where he acquainted himself with [[Armenian culture]] with the help of the abbots belonging to the [[Mekhitarist Order]]. With the help of Father H. Avgerian, he learned the [[Armenian language]],<ref name="byronbook" /> and attended many seminars about language and history. He wrote ''English Grammar and Armenian'' (''Qerakanutyun angghiakan yev hayeren'') in 1817, and ''Armenian Grammar and English'' (''Qerakanutyun hayeren yev angghiakan'') in 1819, where he included quotations from [[Classical Armenian|classical]] and [[Armenian language|modern Armenian]]. Byron also participated in the compilation of the ''English Armenian dictionary'' (''Barraran angghieren yev hayeren'', 1821) and wrote the preface in which he explained the relationship of the Armenians with and the oppression of the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] "[[pasha]]s" and the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[satrap]]s, and their struggle of liberation. His two main translations are the ''Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians'', two chapters of [[Movses Khorenatsi]]'s ''[[History of Armenia (Moses of Chorene)|History of Armenia]]'' and sections of [[Nerses of Lambron]]'s ''Orations''.<ref name="SAE">{{hy icon}} Soghomonyan, Soghomon A. <U+00AB>''<U+0532><U+0561><U+0575><U+0580><U+0578><U+0576>, <U+054B><U+0578><U+0580><U+057B> <U+0546><U+0578><U+0565><U+056C> <U+0533><U+0578><U+0580><U+0564><U+0578><U+0576>''<U+00BB> (Byron, George Noel Gordon).

===In Italy and Greece===

{{See|Greek War of Independence}}

[[File:Lord Byron in Albanian dress.jpg|thumb|Lord Byron in Albanian dress painted by [[Thomas Phillips]] in 1813. This painting can be viewed at the Venizelos Mansion, which is the British Ambassador's residence in Athens.]]

From 1821 to 1822, he finished Cantos 6<U+2013>12 of ''Don Juan'' at Pisa, and in the same year he joined with [[Leigh Hunt]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] in starting a short-lived newspaper, ''The Liberal'', in the first number of which appeared ''[[The Vision of Judgment]]''. His last Italian home was [[Genoa]], where he was still accompanied by the Countess Guiccioli, and where he met [[Charles John Gardiner, 1st Earl of Blessington]], and [[Marguerite, Countess of Blessington]] and provided the material for her work ''Conversations with Lord Byron'', an important text in the reception of Byron in the period immediately after his death.

Byron lived in Genoa until 1823, when, growing bored with his life there he accepted overtures for his support from representatives of the movement for Greek independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}On 16 July, Byron left Genoa on the ''Hercules'', arriving at [[Kefalonia]] in the [[Ionian Islands]] on 4 August. He spent <U+00A3>4000 of his own money to refit the Greek fleet, then sailed for [[Messolonghi]] in western Greece, arriving on 29 December to join [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]], a Greek politician with military power.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}During this time, Byron pursued his Greek page, Lukas Chalandritsanos, but the affections went unrequited.<ref name="real byron" /> When the famous Danish sculptor [[Thorvaldsen]] heard about Byron's heroics in Greece, he voluntarily resculpted his earlier bust of Byron in Greek marble.<ref name="byronbook" />

===Death===

Mavrokordato and Byron planned to attack the Turkish-held fortress of [[Naupactus|Lepanto]], at the mouth of the [[Gulf of Corinth]]. Byron employed a fire-master to prepare artillery and took part of the rebel army under his own command, despite his lack of [[Military history of Greece|military]] experience, but before the expedition could sail, on 15 February 1824, he fell ill, and the usual remedy of [[Bloodletting|bleeding]] weakened him further.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} He made a partial recovery, but in early April he caught a violent cold which therapeutic bleeding, insisted on by his doctors, aggravated. It is suspected this treatment, carried out with unsterilised medical instrumentation, may have caused him to develop [[sepsis]]. He developed a violent fever, and died on 19 April.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} It has been said that had Byron lived and gone on to defeat the Ottomans, he might have been declared King of Greece. However, this is unlikely<ref name="real byron" />

Byron's body was embalmed, but the Greeks wanted some part of their hero to stay with them. According to some sources, his heart remained at [[Messolonghi]].<ref>

According to others,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} it was his lungs, which were placed in an urn that was later lost when the city was sacked.

Huge crowds viewed his body as he lay in state for two days in London.<ref name="real byron" /> He is buried at the [[Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Hucknall|Church of St. Mary Magdalene]] in [[Hucknall]], [[Nottingham]].

At her request, [[Ada Lovelace]], the child he never knew, was buried next to him. In later years, the Abbey allowed a duplicate of a marble slab given by the [[List of Kings of Greece|King of Greece]], which is laid directly above Byron's grave. Byron's friends raised the sum of 1,000&nbsp;pounds to commission a statue of the writer; Thorvaldsen offered to sculpt it for that amount.<ref name="byronbook" /> However, for ten years after the statue was completed in 1834, most British institutions turned it down, and it remained in storage.

In 1969, 145 years after Byron's death, a memorial to him was finally placed in Westminster Abbey.<ref name="abbey">

[[Robert Ripley]] had drawn a picture of [[Epitaph to a Dog|Boatswain's grave]] with the caption "Lord Byron's dog has a magnificent tomb while Lord Byron himself has none". This came as a shock to the English, particularly schoolchildren, who, Ripley said, raised funds of their own accord to provide the poet with a suitable memorial. (Source: ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'', 3rd Series, 1950; p. xvi.)

On a very central area of Athens, Greece, outside the National Garden, is a statue depicting Greece in the form of a woman crowning Byron. The statue was made by the French Henri-Michel Chapu and Alexandre Laguiere. An Athenian suburb, Vyronas, was also named after him. 

Upon his death, the barony passed to Byron's cousin [[George Byron, 7th Baron Byron|George Anson Byron]], a career military officer and his polar opposite in temperament and lifestyle.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==Poetic works==

Byron wrote prolifically.<ref>
{{cite web

| accessdate = 2008-11-20
}}</ref>
In 1832 his publisher, [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]], released the complete works in 14 duodecimo volumes, including a life<ref name="moore life" /> by [[Thomas Moore]]. Subsequent editions were released in 17 volumes, first published a year later, in 1833.

Although Byron falls chronologically into the period most commonly associated with Romantic poetry, much of his work looks back to the satiric tradition of [[Alexander Pope]] and [[John Dryden]].

=== ''Don Juan'' ===

{{Main|Don Juan (Byron)}}

Byron's [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''Don Juan'', a poem spanning 17 cantos, ranks as one of the most important long poems published in England since [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} The masterpiece, often called the [[Epic poetry|epic]] of its time, has roots deep in literary tradition and, although regarded by early [[Victorians]] as somewhat shocking, equally involves itself with its own contemporary world at all levels&nbsp;<U+2014> social, political, literary and ideological.

Byron published the first two cantos anonymously in 1819 after disputes with his regular publisher over the shocking nature of the poetry; by this time, he had been a famous poet for seven years, and when he self-published the beginning cantos, they were well received in some quarters.<ref name="companion" /> It was then released volume by volume through his regular publishing house.<ref name="companion" /> By 1822, cautious acceptance by the public had turned to outrage, and Byron's publisher refused to continue to publish the works.<ref name="companion" /> In Canto III of ''[[Don Juan]]'', Byron expresses his detestation for poets such as [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].<ref name="companion" /><ref>

===Byronic hero===

The figure of the [[Byronic hero]] pervades much of his work, and Byron himself is considered to epitomise many of the characteristics of this literary figure.<ref name="real byron" /> Scholars have traced the literary history of the Byronic hero from [[John Milton]], and many authors and artists of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] show Byron's influence during the 19th century and beyond, including [[Charlotte Bront<U+00EB>|Charlotte]] and [[Emily Bront<U+00EB>]].<ref name="real byron" /> The Byronic hero presents an idealised, but flawed character whose attributes include{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}: great talent; great passion; a distaste for society and social institutions; a lack of respect for rank and privilege (although they possess both); being thwarted in love by social constraint or death; rebellion; exile; an unsavory secret past; arrogance; overconfidence or lack of foresight; and, ultimately, a self-destructive manner.

===Parthenon marbles===

{{Main|Elgin Marbles}}

Byron was a bitter opponent of [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]]'s removal of the [[Parthenon marbles]] from Greece, and "reacted with fury" when Elgin's agent gave him a tour of the Parthenon, during which he saw the missing friezes and metopes. He penned a poem, ''The Curse of Minerva'', to denounce Elgin's actions.<ref>

==Character and description==

Lord Byron obtained a reputation as being extravagant, melancholic, courageous,<ref name="nytimes 1898" /> unconventional, eccentric, flamboyant<ref name="real byron" /> and controversial.<ref name="hudsonreview" /> He was independent and given to extremes of temper; on at least one trip, his traveling companions were so puzzled by his mood swings they thought he was mentally ill.<ref name="nytimes 1898" /><ref name="hudsonreview" /> He enjoyed adventure, especially relating to the sea.<ref name="nytimes 1898" />

He believed his depression was inherited, and he wrote in 1821, "I am not sure that long life is desirable for one of my temper & constitutional depression of Spirits."<ref name="hudsonreview" />

Byron was noted even during his time for the extreme loyalty he inspired in his friends.<ref name="hudsonreview" /> Hobhouse said, "No man lived who had such devoted friends."<ref name="hudsonreview" />

The first recorded notable example of open water swimming took place on May 3, 1810 when [[Lord Byron]] swam from [[Europe]] To [[Asia]] across the [[Hellespont]] Strait.<ref>[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=3958 History.com]</ref> This is often seen as the birth of the sport and pastime and to commemorate it, the event is recreated every year as an open water swimming event.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2007/sep/30/escape.turkey Guardian.co.uk]</ref> 

===Physical description===

Byron's adult height was about {{Convert|5|ft|10|in|m|2}}, his weight fluctuating between {{Convert|9.5|stone|lb kg}} and {{Convert|14|stone|lb kg}}. He was renowned for his personal beauty, which he enhanced by wearing curl-papers in his hair at night.<ref name="JHB" /> He was athletic, being a competent boxer and horse-rider and an excellent swimmer. At Harrow, he played cricket, although he was unskillful.

From birth, Byron suffered from an unknown deformity of his right foot (generally referred to as a "[[clubfoot]]" at the time, though some modern medical experts maintain that it was a consequence of infantile paralysis ([[poliomyelitis]]), and others that it was a [[dysplasia]], a failure of the region to form properly),<ref>MacCarthy, pp. 3-4</ref> causing a limp that resulted in lifelong misery for him, aggravated by painful and pointless "medical treatment" in his childhood and the suspicion that with proper care it might have been cured.<ref name="byron shelley" /> He was extremely self-conscious about this from a young age, nicknaming himself ''{{lang|fr|le diable boiteux}}''<ref>Eisler, Benita (1999). ''Byron: Child of Passion, Fool of Fame''. Alfred A. Knopf, ISBN 0-679-41299-9, chapter one ([http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/e/eisler-byron.html online] at ''[[The New York Times]]''), p. 13: "For Byron, his deformed foot became the crucial catastrophe of his life. He saw it as the mark of satanic connection, referring to himself as ''le diable boiteux'', the lame devil."</ref> ([[French language|French]] for "the lame devil", after the nickname given to [[Asmodeus]] by [[Alain-Ren<U+00E9> Lesage]] in his 1707 novel of the same name). However, he refused to wear any type of mechanical device that could improve the limp,<ref name="nytimes 1898" /> although he often wore specially made shoes that would hide the deformed foot.<ref name="real byron" />

Byron and other writers such as his friend John Cam Hobhouse left detailed descriptions of his eating habits. At the time he entered Cambridge, he went on a strict diet to control his weight. He also exercised a great deal, and at that time wore a great number of clothes to cause himself to perspire. For most of his life he was a vegetarian, and often lived for days on dry biscuits and white wine. Occasionally he would eat large helpings of meat and desserts, after which he would [[bulemia|purge himself]]. His friend Hobhouse claimed that his weight problem was caused by the pain of his deformed foot which made it difficult for him to exercise.<ref name="JHB">

===Celebrity===

Byron is considered to be the first modern-style celebrity. His image as the personification of the Byronic hero fascinated the public,<ref name="real byron" /> and his wife Annabella coined the term "Byromania" to refer to the commotion surrounding him.<ref name="real byron" /> His self-awareness and personal promotion are seen as a beginning to what would become the modern rock star; he would instruct artists painting portraits of him not to paint him with pen or book in hand, but as a "man of action."<ref name="real byron" /> While Byron first welcomed fame, he later turned from it by going into voluntary exile from Britain.<ref name="hudsonreview" />

===Fondness for animals===

Byron had a great fondness for animals, most notably for a [[Newfoundland dog]] named Boatswain; when Boatswain contracted [[rabies]], Byron reportedly nursed him without any fear of becoming bitten and infected.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Boatswain lies buried at Newstead Abbey, and has a monument larger than his master's. Byron at one point expressed interest in being buried next to Boatswain.<ref name="byronbook" /> The inscription, Byron's ''[[Epitaph to a Dog]]'', has become one of his best-known works, reading in part:<ref>

<!-- Spelling & capitalisation are as they occur on Boatswain's monument; 'ferosity' was a legitimate variant at the time. -->
<poem style="margin-left: 2em;">
Near this Spot
are deposited the Remains of one
who possessed Beauty without Vanity,
Strength without Insolence,
Courage without Ferocity,
and all the Virtues of Man without his Vices.
This praise, which would be unmeaning Flattery
if inscribed over human Ashes,
is but a just tribute to the Memory of
BOATSWAIN, a DOG,
who was born in Newfoundland May 1803,
and died at Newstead Nov.<sup>r</sup> 18<sup>th</sup>, 1808.
</poem>

Byron also kept a bear while he was a student at Trinity College, Cambridge (reputedly out of resentment of Trinity rules forbidding pet dogs&nbsp;<U+2014> he later suggested that the bear apply for a college fellowship).{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} At other times in his life, Byron kept a [[fox]], monkeys, a [[parrot]], [[cat]]s, an [[eagle]], a [[crow]], a [[crocodile]], a [[falcon]], peacocks, guinea hens, an Egyptian [[crane (bird)|crane]], a [[badger]], [[goose|geese]], and a [[heron]].

==Lasting influence==

The re-founding of the [[Byron Society]] in 1971 reflects the fascination that many people have for Byron and his work.<ref>

This society has become very active, publishing an annual journal. Today 36 Byron Societies function throughout the world, and an International Conference takes place annually.

Byron exercised a marked influence on Continental literature and art, and his reputation as a poet is higher in many European countries than in Britain or America, although not as high as in his time, when he was widely thought to be the greatest poet in the world.<ref name="hudsonreview" /> Byron has inspired the works of [[Franz Liszt]], [[Hector Berlioz]], and [[Giuseppe Verdi]].<ref name="hudsonreview" />

===Fictional depictions===
Byron first appeared as a thinly disguised fictional character in his ex-love Lady Caroline Lamb's book ''Glenarvon'', published in 1816.<ref name="real byron" />

Byron is the main character of the film ''Byron'' by the Greek film maker [[Nikos Koundouros]].

Byron's spirit is one of the title characters of the ''[[Ghosts of Albion]]'' books by [[Amber Benson]] and [[Christopher Golden]]. [[John Crowley]]'s book ''Lord Byron's Novel: The Evening Land At Night'' (2005) involves the rediscovery of a lost manuscript by Lord Byron, as does [[Frederic Prokosch]]'s ''The Missolonghi Manuscript'' (1968). Byron appears as a character in [[Tim Powers]]'s ''[[The Stress of Her Regard]]'' (1989) and ''[[The Anubis Gates]]'' (1983), and [[Walter Jon Williams]]'s novella ''Wall, Stone Craft'' (1994), and also in [[Susanna Clarke]]'s ''[[Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell]]'' (2004).

Byron is an immortal still alive in modern times, in the television show ''[[Highlander: The Series]]'' in the fifth season episode ''The Modern Prometheus'', living as a decadent rock star.

[[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]], in his 1995 novel ''The Vampyre: Being the True Pilgrimage of George Gordon, Sixth Lord Byron'', romantically describes how Lord Byron became a vampire during his first visit to Greece&nbsp;<U+2014> a fictional transformation that explains much of his subsequent behaviour towards family and friends, and finds support in quotes from Byron poems and the diaries of John Cam Hobhouse. It is written as though Byron is retelling part of his life to his great great-great-great-granddaughter. He describes traveling in Greece, Italy, Switzerland, meeting [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], Shelley's death, and many other events in life around that time. The Byron as vampire character returns in the 1996 sequel ''Supping with Panthers''.

Byron and [[Percy Shelley|Percy]] and [[Mary Shelley]] are portrayed in [[Roger Corman]]'s final film ''[[Frankenstein Unbound]]'', where the time traveler Dr. Buchanan (played by [[John Hurt]]) meets them as well as [[Victor von Frankenstein]] (played by [[Ra<U+00FA>l Juli<U+00E1>]]).

originally published in [[Weird Tales]], involves the rediscovery and production of a lost play by Byron (from which Polidori's ''The Vampyre'' was plagiarised) by a man who purports to be a descendant of the poet.

[[Tom Stoppard]]'s play ''[[Arcadia (play)|Arcadia]]'' revolves around a modern researcher's attempts to find out what made Byron leave the country, while [[Howard Brenton]]'s play ''[[Bloody Poetry]]'' features Byron alongside Polidori, the Shelleys and Claire Clairmont.

Television portrayals include a major 2003 BBC drama on Byron's life, and minor appearances in ''[[Highlander: The Series]]'' (as well as the Shelleys), ''[[Blackadder the Third]]'', ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy]]'', episode 60 ([[Darkling (Voyager episode)|Darkling]]) of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', and was also parodied in the animated sketch series, [[Monkey Dust]].

He makes an appearance in the [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternative history]] novel ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' by [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling]]. In a Britain powered by the massive, steam-driven, mechanical computers invented by [[Charles Babbage]], he is leader of the ''Industrial Radical Party'', eventually becoming [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].

The events featuring the Shelleys' and Byron's relationship at the house beside Lake Geneva in 1816 have been fictionalised in film at least three times.

# A 1986 British production, ''[[Gothic (movie)|Gothic]]'', directed by [[Ken Russell]], and starring [[Gabriel Byrne]] as Byron.
# A 1988 Spanish production,  ''[[Rowing with the wind]]'' aka (''Remando al viento''), starring [[Hugh Grant]] as Byron.
# A 1988 U.S.A. production ''Haunted Summer''. Adapted by Lewis John Carlino from the speculative novel by [[Anne Edwards]], starring Philip Anglim as Lord Byron.

The brief prologue to ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' includes Gavin Gordon as Byron, begging Mary Shelley to tell the rest of her Frankenstein story.

The writer and novelist, Benjamin Markovits, is in the process of producing a fictional trilogy about the life of Byron. ''Imposture'' (2007) looked at the poet from the point of view of his friend and doctor, John Polidori. ''A Quiet Adjustment'', which came out in January 2008, is an account of Byron's marriage more sympathetic to his wife, Annabella, than many of its predecessors. He is currently writing the third installment.

Byron is portrayed as an immortal in the book, ''Divine Fire'', by Melanie Jackson. Byron is depicted in the book ''Edward Trencom's Nose'' by [[Giles Milton]].

In ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy]]'' episode "Ecto Cooler", Byron's ghost appears from Billy's mouth, teaching him to be cool.

In the novel ''The History of Lucy's Love Life in Ten and a Half Chapters'', Lucy Lyons uses a time machine to visit 1813 and meet Byron, who is her idol.

Byron is depicted in Tennessee William's play ''[[Camino Real (play)|Camino Real]]''.

Byron's life is the subject of the 2003 made for television movie ''Byron'' starring Jonny Lee Miller.

Byron is depicted as the villain/antagonist in the novel ''Jane Bites Back ''<ref>[http://www.janebitesback.com JaneBitesBack.com]</ref> written by [[Michael Thomas Ford]], published by Ballantine Books, 2010. A novel based on the premise that Jane Austen (and Lord Byron) are Vampires living in the modern day literary world.

The play "A Year Without A Summer" by Brad C. Hodson is about Byron, Polidori, the Shelleys, and Claire Clairmont as they spend that famous summer of 1816 at the Villa Diodati. As opposed to other works dealing with the same period, the play is more a biopic of Byron as he was following his divorce and exile from England than the Shelleys.
