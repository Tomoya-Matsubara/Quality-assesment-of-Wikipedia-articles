The '''Kossuth Colony Historic District''', named for [[Lajos Kossuth]], is a nationally recognized [[historic districts in the United States|historic district]] bounded by Baltimore Street, Mack Avenue and Notre Dame Avenue in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Ohio]]. The Kossuth Colony was built in 1906 to house [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] immigrant workers for the [[Barney and Smith Car Company]], a rail car manufacturer that ranked among Dayton's largest and most venerable firms.  Comparatively few changes have been made to the forty houses in the colony, although the houses' white [[picket fence]]s have been removed.<ref name=dohp>Owen, Lorrie K., ed.

[[St. Clair Shores, Michigan|St. Clair Shores]]: Somerset, 1999, 1047.</ref>  Many houses in the district are simple [[gable]]-front residences with minimal [[Setback (land use)|setbacks]], and [[asbestos]] siding covers many exterior walls in the district.<ref>[http://ohsweb.ohiohistory.org/ohpo/nr/details.aspx?refnum=79001900 Kossuth Colony Historic District], [[Ohio Historical Society]], 2007.

On December 21, 1979, Kossuth Colony was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]; it qualified both as an important example of architecture and because of its connection to Jacob Doffee Moskowitz,<ref name=nris /> the labor contractor who was responsible for bringing the Hungarians and constructing the complex.<ref name=dohp />  The colony has also been named a historic district by the city of Dayton; one of eighteen districts citywide, it is the only one located northeast of [[downtown Dayton]].<ref name="City">{{cite web|title=''City of Dayton - Historic District Map''|accessdate=5 October 2013|url=http://www.cityofdayton.org/departments/pcd/Planning%20Docs/Historic%20Districts%20Map.pdf |format=pdf}}</ref>
