It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on November 29, 2009.

==Plot==
After much anticipation, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] receives an invitation to an award ceremony celebrating his novel, ''Faster Than the Speed of Love'', by the Rhode Island Society for Special Literary Excellence. Convinced he is a great writer, Brian attempts to gain the family's interest but fails to do so. Once he arrives at the "award ceremony" however, he discovers that he has misunderstood the meaning of the word "[[mental retardation|special]]," and all of the club's members are mentally challenged, prompting him to drown his sorrows at the local bar and realize that he's not a writer at all, but a big fat joke. He drives home drunk that night and accidentally runs over and kills a dog. He secretly buries the dead dog's body outside the Griffin's home and tries to keep quiet about it. [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], having witnessed his deed, begins to toy with Brian's guilt, eventually driving him to a state where he decides to confess to the murder. However, when he confesses to [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] and the Griffin family, they all laugh, saying that no one cares if a dog or any other animal is killed, especially by another animal.<ref name="ignpreview">{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/104/1049353p1.html |title=Family Guy Preview: "Dog Gone" |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-11-29}}</ref><ref name="msnplot">{{cite web |url=http://tv.msn.com/tv/episode/family-guy/dog-gone/?silentchk=1 |title=Family Guy - 'Dog Gone' Episode Info |publisher=[[MSN]] |accessdate=2009-12-03}}</ref>

Outraged, Brian starts a support group, and decides to call it "The Quahog Animal Equal Rights League," to convince the town that the life of animals should be of equal value to humans. As the town citizens learn more about it, however, none of them are keen on changing their lifestyles if it means no processed meats and medical research on animals. Refusing to listen any further, they chase after Brian in an attempt to eat him, after he mentions how dogs are eaten in some cultures, which unintentionally sparks their interest in how they taste.

Brian realizes that if no one cares about the lives of animals, then he is worthless to the Griffin family and everyone else. Stewie finds Brian weeping to himself in the bathroom and is unable to break him out of his depression. Realizing how upset Brian is, Stewie takes his collar and successfully fakes his death by placing the collar on a stray and killing it in a [[liquor store]] fire. The Griffins are devastated upon learning about Brian's supposed death, and realize how close a friend he was to them. Seeing this, Stewie rushes upstairs to show Brian how much the Griffins still care about him, regardless of his species. Brian then realizes his life does have a purpose and thanks Stewie for helping him, and decides to remain hidden to let the Griffins grieve a little longer.

Meanwhile, [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] accidentally knocks over a carton of [[Kool-Aid]] mix on the kitchen floor of the Griffin's house and leaves [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] to take the blame. Frustrated with having to clean Peter's messes, [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] hires a Hispanic maid named Consuela to clean their house. But Consuela quickly proves to be very stubborn, refusing to leave after her work hours and sleeping at the Griffins' house overnight, much to Peter and Lois's annoyance. They try to fire her and even bribe her to leave, but she still refuses. In a last-ditch attempt, Peter finally gets rid of her by tricking her into inhaling [[chloroform]] on a handkerchief, and leaves her in a basket on Joe's front porch.

At the end, Peter lets us know that everyone at ''Family Guy'' respects all living beings and assures us that no animals were harmed in the making of the episode, but they do hurt the feelings of an Italian opera singer by prematurely dropping the curtain on his performance.

After going to the bar to drink, Brian talks to Bill, the father from ''[[The Family Circus]]'' [[print syndication|syndicated]] comic strip. After Bill tells him he should have tried harder on writing his book, Brian responds by yelling that all Bill does is "judge" other people, and demands for him to go home and "[[fuck]] his wife in the face", to which Bill agrees. This is also later recognized by Peter the next day, when he is seen reading [[comic strip|the funnies]], and murmurs to himself, "this is a very shocking ''Family Circus''."<ref name="ignreview"/><ref name="tvcritic">{{cite web |url=http://www.thetvcritic.org/dog-gone/ |title=The TV Critic.org&nbsp;<U+2014> Episode 8 - Dog Gone Review |publisher=The TV Critic.org |accessdate=2009-12-02}}</ref>

In an attempt to try to prove that an animal has the same rights as humans, Brian starts an advocacy group, and is suggested by Lois to join [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]], but she is unable to enunciate the word differently from how she pronounces "Peter," leading her husband to become confused.<ref name="ignreview"/><ref name="peta">{{cite web |url=http://blog.peta.org/archives/2009/11/family_guy.php |title=How Cutting-Edge, 'Family Guy' |publisher=PETA |author=Schinke, Amanda |accessdate=2009-12-03}}</ref> Brian goes on to create a public service announcement regarding animal rights, one of which involves a dog being "tortured" by having to listen to the radio show ''[[All Things Considered]]'' on [[National Public Radio]], which the dog's owner leaves on for him before leaving the house.<ref name="peta"/><ref name="slingrefs"/>

==Reception==
In an improvement over the previous four episodes, the episode was viewed in 8.48 million homes in its original airing, according to [[Nielsen ratings]], despite airing simultaneously with ''[[Sunday Night Football]]'', the television movie ''[[A Dog Named Christmas]]'' on [[CBS]] and ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The episode also acquired a 4.4 rating in the 18-49 demographic, beating ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' and ''[[American Dad!]]'', but was ultimately edged out slightly by ''The Simpsons'' in total viewership.<ref name="ratings"/>

Reviews of the episode were highly positive, citing the Brian and Stewie storyline as a "solid attempt to tell a good story," and the Consuela scenes as "terrific." Ahsan Haque of [[IGN]] also noted that "the writers deserved some credit" for the episode, saying that, in comparison to past episodes the episode did not "come across as a haphazardly assembled string of {{interp|random}} jokes."<ref name="ignreview"/> Jason Hughes of [[Weblogs, Inc.#TV Squad|TV Squad]] also found the Consuela scenes to be "hilarious," but found the final scene to be "strangely {{interp|...}} uncomfortable," expecting Meg to be pushed out of the family hug.<ref name="tvsquad"/> Todd VanDerWerff of the [[The A.V. Club]] praised the handling of Brian's character in the episode, and called the Peter and PETA gag "pretty cheap, but quite funny," giving the episode a B rating overall.<ref>{{cite web|http://www.avclub.com/articles/rednecks-and-broomsticksfrom-bed-to-worsedog-goneg,35810/|title=[http://www.avclub.com/articles/rednecks-and-broomsticksfrom-bed-to-worsedog-goneg,35810/  "Rednecks and Broomsticks"/"From Bed to Worse"/"Dog Gone"/"G-String Circus"]|publisher=[[The A.V.

In a post on PETA's official blog, Amanda Schinke, however, was highly critical of the episode for its "myriad of violent deaths of cartoon dogs." In addition, she called for the show to "hire {{interp|writers}} who can generate material that doesn't make us roll our eyes."<ref name="peta"/> In February 2010, "Dog Gone" won a [[Genesis Awards|Genesis Award]] in the television comedy.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:EMxmWoBWwBAJ:www.humanesociety.org/about/events/genesis_awards/nominees.html+genesis+awards+2010+nominees&hl=en&client=firefox-a&gl=us&strip=1|archivedate=March 26, 2010|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/about/events/genesis_awards/nominees.html|publisher=[[The Humane Society of the United States]]|title=Nominees for the Genesis Awards|publisher=[[Humane Society]]|accessdate=March 26, 2010}}</ref>
