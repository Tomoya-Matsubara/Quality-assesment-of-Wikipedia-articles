'''Cable''' was a British [[Alternative (music)|alternative]] rock band formed in the early 1990s by Matt Bagguley (guitar, vocals), Darius Hinks (guitar), Pete Darrington (bass) and Neil Cooper (drums). Cooper left in 1995, and was replaced by Richie Mills. Influenced by [[The Pixies]] and [[Steve Albini]], they recorded their first session for the BBC's ''[[John Peel]] Show'' in October 1994.

During recording, the band ran into [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] at Rockfield Recording Studios and sparked a fight between the Gallagher brothers when a drunk Darius was asked for his opinion of the new Oasis album. Typically honest, he replied: "sounds like the Beatles... a total fucking rip-off and the worst kind of lowest common denominator trash." {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

In 1997 the single "Freeze the Atlantic" was used in a Sprite TV advert. Despite this and heavy promotion by Infectious Records, as well as critical acclaim from both the [[indie (music)|indie]] and [[heavy metal|metal]] press, topped with near-constant touring, the band failed cross over to commercial success.

The band was forced to split in 1999 due to a lawsuit filed by their former manager Brian Hallin;{{Fact|date=February 2007}} and ''Sub-Lingual'' was to be their final album.

Splinter groups formed from Cable are Hudson Super Six featuring bassist Pete Darrington,  and The Lucky Nine featuring drummer Richie Mills.  Richie also now fronts a band tentatively titled [http://www.millsrocks.com/ MiLLS] in which he is vocalist/guitarist. Neil Cooper now drums for alternative metal band [[Therapy?]].
