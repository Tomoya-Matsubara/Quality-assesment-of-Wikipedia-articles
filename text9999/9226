'''Third-person shooter''' ('''TPS''') is a [[video game genre|genre]] of [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[action game|action]] [[Video game|games]] in which the [[player character]] is visible on-screen, and the [[gameplay]] consists primarily of shooting. 

==Definition==

A "third person shooter" is a game structured around shooting,<ref name="garrelts">Nate Garrelts, ''The meaning and culture of Grand theft auto: critical essays'' (McFarland, 2006), [http://books.google.com/books?id=Woct9TuzNNoC&pg=PA159&dq=%22Third-person+shooter%22+film&lr=&as_brr=3&ei=5rLXSYvHHoPIyASjuMDbAg 159].</ref> and in which the player can see the avatar on-screen ("third person").<ref name="garrelts"/><ref name="schleiner">Anne-Marie Schleiner, "Does Lara Croft Wear Fake Polygons?

==Design==

Third-person shooters are a type of [[3D graphics|3D]] [[shooter game]], which is a subgenre of [[action game]] that emphasizes the challenge of aiming and shooting. These games are distinguished from other shooter games because the [[graphical perspective]] is rendered from a fixed distance behind the player's avatar, and slightly above them. They tend to be more realistic than 2D shooters, not just graphically but in terms of gameplay. For example, games often limit the amount of ammunition that the [[avatar]] can carry, and damage is usually assessed based on what part of the body is hit by a gunshot. The 3D nature of these games also allows enemies to hide around corners or behind doors in a way that is not possible in a 2D game.<ref name="fundamentals">{{cite book|last=Rollings|first=Andrew|authorlink=|coauthors=Ernest Adams|title=Fundamentals of Game Design|publisher=Prentice Hall|date=2006|location=|url=http://wps.prenhall.com/bp_gamedev_1/54/14053/3597646.cw/index.html}}</ref>

=== Relationship to first-person shooters ===

These games are closely related to [[first-person shooter]]s,<ref name="harbour"/> which also tie to perspective of the player to an avatar,<ref name="fundamentals"/> but the two genres are distinct.<ref>Geddes, Ryan, [http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/914/914918p1.html Beyond Gears of War 2], ''IGN'', Sept 30, 2008, Accessed Apr 2, 2009</ref> While the first-person perspective allows players to aim and shoot without their avatar blocking their view,<ref name="fundamentals"/> the third-person shooter shows the protagonist from an "over the shoulder" or "behind the back" perspective.<ref name="harbour"/><ref name="tombraiderhistory">Blache, Fabian & Fielder, Lauren, [http://uk.gamespot.com/features/tombraider_hist/p4_01.html History of Tomb Raider], GameSpot, Accessed Apr 1, 2009</ref> Thus, the third-person perspective allows the game designer to create a more strongly characterized avatar,<ref name="fundamentals"/> and directs the player's attention as if watching a film. In contrast, a first-person perspective provides the player with greater immersion into the game universe.<ref>Hutcheon, Linda, ''A Theory of Adaptation'' (CRC Press, 2006), pp. 55-56</ref> 

This difference in perspective also has an impact on gameplay. Third-person shooters allow players to see the area surrounding the avatar more clearly.<ref name="fundamentals"/> This viewpoint facilitates more interaction between the character and their surrounding environment, such as the use of tactical [[cover (military)|cover]] in ''[[Gears of War]]'',<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15644342/ | author = Levi Buchanan | title ='Gears of War' is next-gen at its best | publisher = MSNBC | date = 2006-11-10 | accessdate = 2009-03-02 }}</ref> or navigating tight quarters.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://reviews.cnet.com/playstation-2-games/socom-us-navy-seals/4505-9581_7-20697786.html | title = SOCOM: US Navy Seals (PlayStation 2) | author = Ryan Donald | date = 2002-08-27 | accessdate = 2009-04-02 | publisher = CNET }}</ref> As such, the third-person perspective is more optimal for interacting with objects in the game world, such as jumping on platforms, engaging in close combat, or driving a vehicle. However, the third-person perspective can interfere with tasks that require fine aiming.<ref>{{ cite book | publisher = Charles River Media | date = 2002 | title = Game Design Perspectives | author = Fran<U+00E7>ois Dominic Laram<U+00E9>e | ISBN = 1584500905 9781584500902 }}</ref> 

Third person shooters sometimes compensate for their distinct perspective by designing larger, more spacious environments than first-person shooters.<ref>M<U+00E4><U+00E4>tt<U+00E4>, Aki, [http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2992/gdc_2002_realistic_level_design_.php?page=2 GDC 2002: Realistic Level Design in Max Payne], ''GamaSutra'', May 8, 2002, Accessed Apr 6, 2009</ref>

The boundaries between third-person and first-person shooters is not always clear. For example, many third-person shooters allow the player to use a first-person viewpoint for challenges that require precise aiming.<ref name="fundamentals"/> The [[first-person shooter]] ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' was actually designed as a third-person shooter, but added a first-person perspective to improve the interface for aiming and shooting.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.insidemacgames.com/news/story.php?ArticleID=2336 | publisher = Inside Mac Games | title =

==Influence on popular culture==
Alexander R. Galloway writes that the "real-time, over-the-shoulder tracking shots of Gus Van Sant's ''Elephant'' evoke third-person shooter games like ''Max Payne'', a close cousin of the FPS."<ref>Alexander R.
