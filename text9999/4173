'''Brill railway station''' was the terminus of a small railway line in [[Buckinghamshire]], England, known as the [[Brill Tramway]]. Built and owned by the [[Richard Temple-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos|Duke of Buckingham]], it was later operated by [[London]]'s [[Metropolitan Railway]] and in 1933 briefly became one of the two north-western termini of the [[London Underground]], despite being {{convert|45|mi|km}} and over two hours travel from the [[City of London]].

Approximately {{frac|3|4}} of a mile (1.2&nbsp;km) north of [[Brill]], the station was opened in March 1872 as the result of lobbying from local residents and businesses. Cheaply built and [[Land grading|ungraded]] and using poor quality [[locomotive]]s, services on the line were very slow, taking 1&nbsp;hour 45&nbsp;minutes to travel the six miles (10 km) from Brill to the [[junction station]] with mainline services at [[Quainton Road railway station|Quainton Road]]. Although serving a lightly populated area and little used by passengers, the station was a significant point for freight traffic, particularly as a supplier of milk from the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire to [[Aylesbury]] and London. A [[brickworks]] was also attached to the station, but proved unable to compete with nearby rivals and closed within a few years of opening.

In the 1890s it was planned to extend the tramway to [[Oxford]], but the scheme was abandoned. Instead, the operation of the line was taken over by the Metropolitan Railway in 1899 to become one of the railway's two north-western termini. The line was upgraded and better quality locomotives were introduced, reducing the journey time to Quainton Road by almost two-thirds.

In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway was taken into public ownership and became the [[Metropolitan Line]] of [[London Passenger Transport Board|London Transport]]. London Transport aimed to reduce goods services, and it was felt that there was little chance of the more distant parts of the former Metropolitan Railway ever becoming viable passenger routes. The line was closed on 30 November 1935, and all buildings and infrastructure at Brill associated with the line were sold at auction and subsequently demolished. The site of the station is now a light industrial development known as "Tramway Business Park".

==Wotton Tramway==
On 23 September 1868 the small [[Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway]] (A&BR) opened, linking the [[Great Western Railway]]'s station at [[Aylesbury railway station|Aylesbury]] to the [[London and North Western Railway]]'s [[Varsity Line|Oxford to Bletchley line]] at [[Verney Junction railway station|Verney Junction]].<ref name="Connor00-47">Connor (2000), p.47</ref> On 1 September 1894 London's [[Metropolitan Railway]] (MR) reached Aylesbury,<ref name="Connor00-47" /> and shortly afterwards connected to the A&BR line, with local MR services running to Verney Junction from 1 April 1894.<ref name="Connor00-47" /> Through trains from the MR's London terminus at [[Baker Street tube station|Baker Street]] commenced on 1 January 1897.<ref name="Connor00-47" />

[[Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos]], had long had an interest in railways, and had served as Chairman of the London and North Western Railway from 1852 to 1861. In the early 1870s he decided to build a [[light railway]] to transport freight from his estates in Buckinghamshire to the A&BR's line at [[Quainton Road railway station|Quainton Road]].<ref name="Oppitz73">Oppitz (2000), p.73</ref>{{#tag:ref|Because the proposed line ran on land owned by the Duke of Buckingham and by the Winwood Charity Trust, who consented to its construction,<ref name="Simpson69">Simpson (2005), p.69</ref> the line did not need Parliamentary approval and construction could begin immediately.<ref name="Oppitz73" /><ref name="Mitchelliii">Mitchell & Smith (2006), <U+00A7>iii</ref>|group=note}}
The first stage of the line, known as the [[Brill Tramway|Wotton Tramway]], was a {{convert|4|mi|km|adj=on}} line from Quainton Road via [[Wotton railway station|Wotton]] to a coal siding at [[Kingswood, Buckinghamshire|Kingswood]],<ref name="Horne18">Horne (2003), p.18</ref> opened on 1 April 1871.<ref name="Oppitz73" /><ref name="Demuth6">Demuth (2003), p.6</ref> Intended for use by [[Horsecar|horse trams]], the line was built with [[Baulk road|longitudinal sleepers]] to avoid horses tripping on the sleepers.<ref name="Horne18" /><ref name="Oppitz74">Oppitz (2000), p.74</ref>

===Extension to Brill===

Lobbying from the nearby town of [[Brill]] for the introduction of passenger services on the line led to an extension from Wotton to a new terminus at the foot of [[Brill Hill]] {{frac|3|4}} of a mile (1.2&nbsp;km) north of the hilltop town of Brill itself,<ref name="Horne18" /> in March 1872 and the introduction of two [[mixed train]]s each day in each direction,<ref name="Demuth6" /><ref name="Oppitz75">Oppitz (2000), p.75</ref><ref name="Foxell155">Foxell (2010), p.155</ref> at which time the line was renamed the Brill Tramway. The Duke bought two [[Aveling and Porter]] [[traction engine]]s modified to work as locomotives for the line, each with a top speed of {{convert|8|mph|sigfig=2}},<ref name="Oppitz75" /><ref name="Simpson70">Simpson (2005), p.70</ref> although a speed limit of {{convert|5|mph|sigfig=1}} was enforced.<ref name="Simpson69" />

The Duke died in 1889, and in 1894 the [[trustee]]s of his [[estate (law)|estate]] set up the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company (O&ATC) with the intention of extending the line from Brill to [[Oxford]], although the extension beyond Brill was never built.<ref name="Simpson72">Simpson (2005), p.72</ref>{{#tag:ref|Rail services from London to Oxford were very poor at this time; despite being an extremely roundabout route, had the connection from Quainton Road to Oxford been built it would have been the shortest route between Oxford and the City of London.<ref name="Horne18" />|group=note}} The MR leased the Brill Tramway from 1 December 1899,<ref name="Connor00-47" /> although the line continued to be owned by the O&ATC.<ref name="Demuth18">Demuth (2003), p.18</ref>{{#tag:ref|Although from 1899 services were operated by the Metropolitan Railway (the Metropolitan Line of the London Underground from July 1933), the track and stations remained owned by the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company and controlled by the Trustees of the late Earl Temple's Estate.<ref name="Demuth18" /> The MR had an option to purchase the line outright, but it was never taken up.<ref name="Oppitz77">Oppitz (2000), p.77</ref>|group=note}}

==Services and facilities==
Brill was a small town of 1,400 people when the line opened,<ref name="Mitchell44">Mitchell & Smith (2006), <U+00A7>44</ref> and owing to the town's hilltop setting the station was {{frac|3|4}} of a mile (1.2&nbsp;km) from the town itself.<ref name="Horne18" /> Brill railway station was a small station with a single low platform.<ref name="MitchellXII">Mitchell & Smith (2006), <U+00A7>XII</ref> At the time of opening, there was a single station building which served as the freight depot, passenger terminal and ticket office;<ref name="Mitchell45">Mitchell & Smith (2006), <U+00A7>45</ref> adjacent to the building was a siding leading to a [[cattle pen]].<ref name="MitchellXII" /> After the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the MR introduced a single [[Brown, Marshalls and Co. Ltd.|Brown Marshall]] passenger carriage on the line;<ref name="Simpson72" /> at this time, a small wooden hut was added to the station to serve as a ticket office and waiting room and a short section of platform was raised to conventional height to allow access to the higher doors on the new carriage.<ref name="Simpson72" />

===Passenger services===
From 1872 to 1894 the station was served by two passenger trains per day, and from 1895 to 1899 the number was increased to three per day.<ref name="Mitchelliv">Mitchell & Smith (2006), <U+00A7>iv</ref> Following the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the station was served by four trains per day until closure in 1935.<ref name="Mitchelliv" /> Limited by poor quality locomotives and [[Land grading|ungraded]], cheaply laid track which followed the contours of the hills, and with five intermediate stops to pick up and set down goods, passengers and livestock, trains ran very slowly; in 1887 trains 1&nbsp;hour&nbsp;45&nbsp;minutes to travel the six miles from Brill to the [[junction station]] at Quainton Road.<ref name="Mitchellv">Mitchell & Smith (2006), <U+00A7>v</ref> Improvements to the line carried out at the time of the transfer to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad, and the use of the MR's better quality rolling stock, reduced the journey time from Brill to Quainton Road to between 32 and 36 minutes.<ref name="Mitchellv" />

Serving a lightly populated area and with trains travelling only marginally quicker than walking pace, Brill station saw relatively little passenger use; in 1932, the last year of private operation, Brill station (and the nearby halt at [[Wood Siding railway station|Wood Siding]]) saw only 3,272 passenger journeys and raised only <U+00A3>191 (about <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|191|1932|r=-2}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) in passenger receipts.<ref name="Jackson134">Jackson (2006), p.134</ref>{{Inflation-fn|UK}}

===Goods facilities===
Although little used by passengers, Brill station was valuable as a relatively rapid link between the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire and the markets of Aylesbury and London; around 30 carts per day would deliver milk to Brill station for the first train each morning.<ref name="Mitchell44" /> There was also a small amount of coal traffic to the station; Brill coal dealer George Green received three coal wagons per month.<ref name="Mitchell46">Mitchell & Smith (2006), <U+00A7>46</ref> In addition, a storehouse at the station held beer supplied by the breweries of [[Brackley]] and Aylesbury, while bricks and tiles from the brick and tile factories of Brill were used in the construction of [[Waddesdon Manor]], near the eastern end of the Brill Tramway, between 1874 and 1889.<ref name="Simpson111">Simpson (2005), p.111</ref>

In 1885 the Duke of Buckingham opened a modern brickworks near Brill station, with a dedicated siding, and in 1895 his heir [[William Temple-Gore-Langton, 4th Earl Temple of Stowe]] expanded the brickworks into the Brill Brick & Tile Works, using the Brill Tramway to deliver bricks to the mainline at Quainton Road.<ref name="Simpson111" /> With the connection to Oxford and the upgrading of the rail line abandoned, Brill Brick & Tile Works proved unable to compete with the nearby brickworks at [[Calvert, Buckinghamshire|Calvert]], and the brickworks soon closed.<ref name="Simpson111" />{{#tag:ref|In 1899 the [[Great Central Railway]] mainline from London to Manchester was built, running directly past the brickworks at Calvert. As a consequence, it was far cheaper and faster for the industries of Lancashire and London to buy bricks from Calvert instead of Brill, despite the towns being less than seven&nbsp;miles (11km) apart.<ref name="Simpson111" />|group=note}} The building was taken over by the Fenemore workshop, making [[Loader (equipment)|hay loaders]], before being converted into a [[Lumber yard|timber yard]] in the 1920s.<ref name="Simpson111" />

==Closure==
On 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan Railway, along with London's other underground railways aside from the small [[Waterloo & City Railway]], was taken into public ownership as part of the newly formed [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (LPTB).<ref name="Demuth18" /> Thus, despite it being {{convert|45|mi|km}} and over two hours travel from the [[City of London]], Brill station became a terminus of the [[London Underground]] network.<ref name="Foxell66">Foxell (2010), p.66</ref>{{#tag:ref|Despite being a part of the London Underground network, Brill<U+2014>in common with all Metropolitan Line stations north of Aylesbury<U+2014>was never shown on the [[tube map]].<ref name="Horne53">Horne (2003), p.53</ref>|group=note}} [[Frank Pick]], Managing Director of the [[Underground Electric Railways Company|Underground Group]] from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, aimed to move the network away from freight services and saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes,<ref name="Foxell72">Foxell (2010), p.72</ref> concluding that over <U+00A3>2000 (about <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|2000|1935|r=-4}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) would be saved by closing the Brill Tramway.{{Inflation-fn|UK}}<ref name="Horne55">Horne (2003), p.55</ref> As a consequence, the LPTB decided to abandon all passenger services beyond Aylesbury.<ref name="Connor00-47" /><ref name="Foxell72" />{{#tag:ref|While the Brill Tramway was closed completely following transfer to public ownership, the LPTB considered the Verney Junction branch as having a use as a freight line and as a [[Detour|diversionary route]], and continued to maintain the line and to operate freight services until 6 September 1947.<ref name="Foxell155" />|group=note}} The Brill Tramway was closed on 1 December 1935,<ref name="Connor00-47" /><ref name="Foxell73">Foxell (2010), p.73</ref> with the last services running on 30 November.<ref name="Demuth18" /><ref name="Times closure">{{Cite newspaper The Times|articlename=Bucks railway to be scrapped||section=News|day_of_week=Monday|date=1935-12-02|page_number=8|issue=47236|column=E}}</ref>
