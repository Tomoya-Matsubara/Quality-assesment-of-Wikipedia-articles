The '''447th Air Expeditionary Group''' was a provisional [[United States Air Force]] unit assigned to the [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC) and [[United States Air Forces Central]] (USAFCENT).  The unit was last stationed at [[Sather Air Base]] on [[Baghdad International Airport]] in Iraq in support of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and [[Iraq War#2010: U.S. drawdown and Operation New Dawn|Operation New Dawn]].

The group was first active during [[World War II]] as the '''447th Bombardment Group''' It participated in combat in the [[European Theater of Operations]] with [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] at [[RAF Rattlesden]] as part of [[Eighth Air Force]]. During [[Big Week]], 20<U+2013>25 February 1944, the 447th took part in the intensive campaign of heavy bombers against the German aircraft industry.

[[Robert Edward Femoyer|2d Lieutenant Robert E. Femoyer]], of the 711th Bombardment Squadron, was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his heroic actions during a mission over [[Merseburg, Germany]], on 2 November 1944.  The group returned to the United States following the war and was inactivated.

The group was activated again in 1947 in the [[Air Force Reserve]].  It moved to [[Castle Air Force Base]], California in 1949, where it became a corollary unit of the active duty [[93d Bombardment Group]].  It was called to active service in 1951 and was inactivated shortly thereafter while its members were used as fillers for other units.

In 2003, as the '''447th Air Expeditionary Group''', the unit was converted to provisional status and assigned to [[Air Combat Command]] to activate as needed.  From April 2003 to December 2011, the group served at [[Sather Air Base]], Iraq.

====Training in the United States====
The group was first activated on 1 May 1943 at [[Ephrata Army Air Base]], Washington as the '''447th Bombardment Group'''.<ref name=Maurer447BG/> The group's original squadrons were the [[708th Bombardment Squadron|708th]],<ref name=Maurer708BS>{{cite book|editor=Maurer, Maurer|title=Combat Squadrons of the Air Force, World War II|origyear=1969|url= http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/Publications/fulltext/combat_sq_of_the_af_wwii.pdf |edition= reprint|year=1982|publisher=Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-405-12194-6|oclc=72556|lccn=70605402|page=711}}</ref> [[709th Bombardment Squadron|709th]],<ref name=Maurer709BS>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 711-712</ref> [[710th Bombardment Squadron|710th]]<ref name=Maurer710BS>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', p. 712</ref> and [[711th Bombardment Squadron]]s.<ref name=Maurer447BG/><ref name=Maurer711BS>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 712-713</ref>

The original mission of the 447th was to be an operational training unit.<ref>{{cite book|Editor=Surridge, & Dooley, Edward C.|title=Pictorial History of the 447th Bombardment Group (H)|url= http://digicom.bpl.lib.me.us/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1108&context=ww_reg_his  |accessdate=January 16, 2014|series=

The [[en cadre|cadre]] trained at [[Brooksville Army Air Field]] with the [[1st Bombardment Squadron]], engaging in simulated attacks against Mobile, Charleston and New Orleans.  The squadron then trained at [[Rapid City Army Air Base]], South Dakota with the [[17th Bombardment Training Wing]].  In June 1943 the group moved to [[Harvard Army Air Field]], Nebraska for Phase I training. The group lost three planes during training, two due to a mid-air collision in August 1943, and one to adverse weather in October.<ref name=SD19>Surridge & Dooley, pp. 19-21</ref>

The first 42 of the group's B-17s began to move from the United States to the European theater of operations in November 1943.  The unit sailed on the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth]] on 23 November 1943 and arrived at the [[Firth of Clyde]] on 29 November 1943.<ref name=Freeman>{{cite book|last=Freeman|first = Roger A.|title=The Mighty Eighth: Units, Men and Machines (A History of the US 8th Army Air Force)|year=1970 |publisher=Macdonald and Company|location=London, England, UK |isbn= 978-0-87938-638-2|page=257}}</ref> The air echelon moved overseas via southern ferry route in early November 1943.

====Combat in the European Theater====
The group was stationed at [[RAF Rattlesden]], England from 25 November 1943 to 1 August 1945. The group flew its first combat mission on 24 December 1943 against a V-1 missile site near [[Saint-Omer]] in northern France.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/092/571.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 447 Bombardment Group May 1943-Apr 1944|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref>    Until May 1944 the 447th helped prepare for the invasion of the European continent by attacking submarine pens, naval installations, and cities in Germany; missile sites and ports in France; and airfields and marshaling yards in France, Belgium and Germany.<ref name=447globalsecurity/> The group conducted heavy bombardment missions against German aircraft industry during [[Big Week]], 20 to 25 February 1944.<ref name=Maurer447BG/>  The group lost 21 B-17s during April 1944.  Only the [[100th Bombardment Group]] lost move [[bombers]] in a single month.<ref>Freeman, p. 139</ref>  Heavy losses continued the following month.  In an attack on [[Zwickau]] the composite wing in which the group was flying was attacked by over 200 [[Luftwaffe]] fighters, and the 447th lost seven Forts.<ref>Freeman, p. 142</ref>

The group supported the invasion of Normandy in June 1944 by bombing airfields and other targets.<ref name=Maurer447BG/>  On [[D-Day]] the group bombed the beachhead area using [[pathfinder]] aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/092/574.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 447 Bombardment Group Mar-Jun 1944|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref>

The group aided in the breakthrough at St. Lo, France, and the effort to take Brest, France, from July to September 1944.<ref name=Maurer447BG/> It bombed strategic targets from October to December 1944, concentrating on [[oil refinery|sources of oil production]].<ref name=Maurer447BG/>   It assaulted marshalling yards, railroad bridges and communication centers during the Battle of the Bulge from December 1944 to January 1945.<ref name=Maurer447BG/> In March 1945 the group bombed an airfield in support of airborne assault across the Rhine.

On 2 November 1944, [[Robert Edward Femoyer|2d Lieutenant Robert E. Femoyer]], a navigator with the group, was flying a mission to [[Merseburg]], Germany.  His B-17 was damaged by [[flak]] and Lt. Femoyer was severely injured in his back and side.  He refused morphine to relieve the pain of his injuries in order to keep his mind alert to navigate the plane out of the danger from heavily defended flak areas and then to a place of safety for his crew.  Because he was too weak to climb back in his seat, he asked other crew members to prop him up so he could read his charts and instruments.  For more than two hours he directed the navigation of his plane back to its home station with no further damage.  Shortly after being removed from his plane, Lt. Femoyer died of his injuries.<ref name=Maurer447BG/><ref>Freeman, p. 180</ref>

The group flew its last combat mission on 21 April 1945 against a marshalling yard at [[Ingolstadt]], Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/092/584.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 447 Bombardment Group Apr 1945|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref>  Two days earlier, it lost a B-17 to an attack by a [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] jet fighter.  The six bombers lost by [[Eighth Air Force]] that day were its last losses of the war.<ref>Freeman, p. 228</ref>

The group redeployed to the United States during the summer 1945. The air echelon ferried their aircraft and personnel back to the United States, leaving on 29 and 30 June 1945. The group ground echelon, along with the 708th and 710th squadrons sailed on the [[List of Liberty ships (Je<U+2013>L)|SS Joseph T. Robinson]] on 1 August 1945, while the 709th and 711th squadrons departed on 3 August 1945 on the [[List of Liberty ships (A<U+2013>F)|SS Benjamin R. Milam]] from Liverpool.  Most personnel were discharged at [[Camp Myles Standish]] after arrival at the port of [[Boston]].  A small cadre proceded to [[Drew Field]], Florida<ref>Surridge & Dooley, pp. 214-215</ref> and the group inactivated on 7 November 1945.<ref name=Maurer447BG/>

The group had flown 247 combat missions, dropping slightly over 17,000 tons of bombs and just under 400 tons of supplies.  One of the group's planes, named "Milk Wagon" flew 129 missions without turning back,<ref>The crew of "Milk Wagon" marked missions by painting milk bottles on the aircraft nose, rather than the traditional bombs.  Freeman, p. 232</ref> a record for the [[3d Air Division]].<ref name=Freeman/>

===Reserves and Korean War===
Two years later, on 25 July 1947, the 447th was redesignated the '''447th Bombardment Group''', Very Heavy. It was activated in the [[Air Force Reserve]] on 12 August 1947, at [[Bergstrom Field]] Texas, and equipped with [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]es. The group was redesignated as the '''447th Bombardment Group''', Medium when the B-29 was classified as a medium bomber and reassigned to [[Castle Air Force Base]], California,<ref name=Maurer447BG/> where it became a corollary unit of the active duty [[93d Bombardment Group]]. The 447th was ordered to active service in May 1951 as a result of the [[Korean War]], with personnel and equipment reassigned to other units. It was inactivated as a "paper unit" on 16 June 1951.<ref name=Maurer447BG/>

===Expeditionary service in Iraq===
[[File:447thaegroup-c130-1.jpg|thumb|Lockheed C-130H Hercules 74-1667 of the 317th Airlift Group being unloaded despite a dust storm at Sather Air Base]]
The group was redesignated the '''447th Air Expeditionary Group''' and converted to provisional status on 28 January 2003.<ref name=447globalsecurity/> The 447th was activated at [[Baghdad International Airport]] in April 2003, after elements of the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] captured the airport 4 April of the same year. The base was named [[Sather Air Base]] on 8 April 2005 in honor of Air Force [[Staff Sergeant]] [[Scott D. Sather]], who was killed two years prior in combat during [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. SSgt Sather was an Air Force [[Special Operations]] combat controller serving with the [[24th Special Tactics Squadron]] at [[Pope Air Force Base]], North Carolina.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.albawaba.com/news/447th-air-expeditionary-group-public-affairs |last1=|first1=|title=447th Air Expeditionary Group Public Affairs|date=March 18, 2008|publisher=Al Bawaba News|deadurl=no |accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref>  As of 2008, Sather was one of the busiest airports in Iraq, leading in number of passengers handled, and placing second in the amount of cargo.<ref name=447globalsecurity/>

The 447th Air Expeditionary Group provided aerial port, control of the military runway, aerial control, base operating support, combat airmen and combat medical support. The group also supported United States and Coalition forces with [[airlift]], supplies and delivery of forces and materials within the [[Baghdad]] area. The 447th operated a joint environment, with Air Force aerial port airmen working next to [[United States Army]] soldiers. The airfield was a joint civilian-military airport, with a military ramp on the west side and a civilian runway and terminal on the other used for international civilian flight operations.<ref name=447globalsecurity>{{cite web |url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/usaf/447aeg.htm |last1=|first1=|title=447th Air Expeditionary Group|date=|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|deadurl=no |accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref>
