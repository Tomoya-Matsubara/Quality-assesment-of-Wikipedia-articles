An '''anapaest''' or '''anapest''', also called '''antidactylus''', is a [[metrical foot]] used in formal [[poetry]]. In classical quantitative meters it consists of two [[short syllable]]s followed by a [[long syllable|long]] one (as in a-na-paest); in accentual stress meters it consists of two unstressed syllables followed by one stressed syllable. It may be seen as a reversed [[dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]].

Here is an example from [[William Cowper]]'s "Verses Supposed to be Written by Alexander Selkirk" (1782), composed in anapaestic [[trimeter]]:

:''I am '''out''' of hu'''ma'''nity's '''reach'''''
:''I must finish my journey alone''

Because of its length and the fact that it ends with a stressed syllable and so allows for strong rhymes, anapaest can produce a very rolling, galloping feeling verse, and allows for long lines with a great deal of internal complexity. The following is from [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]]'s [[The Destruction of Sennacherib]]:

:''The As'''syr'''ian came '''down''' like a '''wolf''' on the '''fold'''''
:''And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold''
:''And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea''
:''When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.''

An even more complex example comes from [[William Butler Yeats|Yeats]] (''The Wanderings of Oisin''). He intersperses anapests and [[iamb]]s, using six-foot lines (rather than four feet as above). Since the anapaest is already a long foot, this makes for very long lines.

:''Fled foam underneath us and 'round us, a wandering and milky smoke''
:''As high as the saddle-girth, covering away from our glances the tide''
:''And those that fled and that followed from the foam-pale distance broke.''
:''The im'''mor'''tal de'''sire''' of im'''mor'''tals we '''saw''' in their '''fac'''es and '''sighed'''.''

The mixture of anapaests and iambs in this manner is most characteristic of late 19th century verse, particularly that of [[Algernon Swinburne]] in poems such as ''The Triumph of Time'' and the choruses from ''[[Atalanta in Calydon]]''. Swinburne also wrote several poems in more or less straight anapaests, with line-lengths varying from three feet ("Dolores") to eight feet ("March: An Ode"). However, the anapaest's most common role in English verse is as a comic metre, the foot of the [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]], of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s poem ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'', [[Edward Lear]]'s nonsense poems, [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''Book of Practical Cats'', a number of [[Dr. Seuss]] stories, and innumerable other examples. 

Apart from their independent role, anapaests are sometimes used as substitutions in iambic verse. In strict [[iambic pentameter]], anapaests are rare, but they are found with some frequency in freer versions of the iambic line, such as the verse of Shakespeare's last plays, or the lyric poetry of the 19th century.
