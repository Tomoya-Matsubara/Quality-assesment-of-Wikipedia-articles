The '''Technology Center''', formerly known as '''Vilar Technology Center'''<ref>{{Cite web| title = Washington & Jefferson College Style Guide| work = | publisher = Washington & Jefferson College| date =2005-11-07| url = http://www.washjeff.edu/uploadedFiles/Academic_Affairs/Technology/a._ITS_Department/Academic_Technology/Teaching_with_Technology/Office%20of%20Communication%20Style%20Guide.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = 2010-05-07}}</ref> is an academic building on the campus of [[Washington & Jefferson College]] housing the Information Technology Leadership program.  It houses over 200 instructional computers for use by the Information Technology Leadership and related classes.  A statue of a [[coal miner]], representing the work ethic and spirit of [[Western Pennsylvania]], sits in the green space in front of the building.

The building was formerly known as the Vilar Technology Center, in honor of [[List of Washington & Jefferson College alumni|alum]] [[Alberto Vilar]], who had pledged $18.1 million to construct the building.  After he reneged on that pledge in 2003, the building was renamed the Technology Center and plans for it were scaled back.  It is the sister building to [[The Burnett Center]], sharing the same architect and general contractor.

==Facilities==
The Technology Center is a four floor Gothic granite building with {{convert|74000|sqft}} of floor space, including a "Global Learning Unit," classrooms, seminar rooms, and faculty and administrative offices."<ref name=scandal /><ref name=catalog>{{Cite web| title = Washington & Jefferson College 2008-2010 Catalog| work = Course Catalog| publisher = Washington & Jefferson College| year = 2008| url = http://www.washjeff.edu/uploadedFiles/Academic_Affairs/Academics/Deans_Office/w&j%20college%20catalog%202006-2008%20pgs%201-219%282%29.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = 2010-05-09}}</ref>  The building had over 200 instructional computers for use by the Information Technology Leadership and related classes<ref>{{Cite web| title = W&J: Photo Gallery | work = | publisher = Washington & Jefferson College| date = | url = http://www.washjeff.edu/content.aspx?section=1361&menu_id=384&crumb=627&id=103| accessdate = 2010-05-09}}</ref>  The ground floor has an "Open Lab" of 39 computers for use by the campus community.<ref>{{Cite web| title = W&J: Computer Labs | work = | publisher = Washington & Jefferson College| date = | url = http://www.washjeff.edu/content.aspx?section=1864&menu_id=526&crumb=343&id=1689| accessdate =2010-05-09}}</ref>  

In 2007, a statue of a [[coal miner]] sculpted by local artist Alan Cottrill was erected outside the Technology Center.<ref name=coal>{{Cite web| title = New Statues to be Unveiled at W&J | work =  | publisher = Washington & Jefferson College| date = 2007-05-15| url = http://www.washjeff.edu/content.aspx?section=2210&menu_id=517&crumb=518&page_title=Current%20Press%20Releases&id=9256 | accessdate = 2010-05-09}}</ref>  It is intended to represent the work ethic and spirit of [[Western Pennsylvania]], as well as the dream that an education can allow people a chance to escape the coal mines.<ref name=coal />

==Information Technology Leadership==
The building was designed for, and is primarily used by, the Information Technology Leadership program.<ref name=crompton />  This academic discipline studies the traditional Information Technology field as a [[liberal art]], where the core principles and [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] connections of the field are examined.<ref>{{Cite web | title = W&J: Information Technology Leadership versus IT | work = | publisher = Washington & Jefferson College| date = | url = http://www.washjeff.edu/content.aspx?section=668&menu_id=182&crumb=471&id=6062 | accessdate = 2010-05-10}}</ref>  Students in this program take a standard curriculum, augmented with focused study in one of 4 possible fields: [[computer science]], data discovery, [[information systems]], and [[new media|new media technologies]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = W&J: Information Technology Leadership  | work = | publisher = Washington & Jefferson College| date = | url = http://www.washjeff.edu/content.aspx?section=926&menu_id=254&crumb=229&id=616| accessdate = 2010-05-10}}</ref>

In 2002, [[Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district|Pennsylvania Congressman]] and former student [[John Murtha]], who was a long-time chair of the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense|House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee]], procured a $2.7 million defense appropriation for the Information Technology Leadership program to develop an remote educational program to would train members of the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] in technology skills, ranging from basic computer literacy to advanced applications.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Congressman Murtha Tours Technology Center | work = W&J Magazine| publisher = Washington & Jefferson College| date = Winter 2002| url = http://www.washjeff.edu/uploadedFiles/External_Relations/For_the_Media/W2002CampusNews.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate =2010-05-09 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | last = Smydo| first =Joe| title =W&J training will keep National Guardsmen wired around the world | newspaper = [[Pittsburgh Post Gazette]]| date = 2003-07-27| url =http://www.post-gazette.com/neigh_washington/20030727wacover2.asp| accessdate = 2010-05-10}}</ref>

==Funding==
In 1999, the college announced that it would build a new building, to be called the Vilar Technology Center, named after billionaire [[List of Washington & Jefferson College alumni|alum]] and well-known opera philanthropist [[Alberto Vilar]], who had pledged $15 million to the project, a pledge that would have been the largest in the college's history.<ref name=flee>{{Cite news | last = Crompton| first = Janice| title = Prosecutors fear W&J alumnus will flee| newspaper = [[Pittsburgh Post Gazette]]| date = 2008-12-14| url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08349/934573-58.stm| accessdate = 2010-05-10}}</ref>  His pledges for the building eventually reached $18.1 million dollars.<ref name=scandal />  Amid Vilar's falling fortunes during the [[dot-com bubble|stock market decreases in 2001 and 2002]], Vilar had reneged on a pledges to a number of organizations, including his pledge to the college.<ref name=scandal /><ref>{{Cite news | last = Wakin| first = Daniel J.| title = Music Patron Is Convicted of Fraud | newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| date = 2008-11-19| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/arts/music/20vila.html| accessdate = 2010-05-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | last = Blumenthal| first = Ralph| title = A Promise Unkept, A Donor Unsung| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| date = 2003-06-07| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/07/arts/a-promise-unkept-a-donor-unsung.html| accessdate = 2010-05-11}}</ref>  By 2003, plans for the building were scaled back and the building had been opened as the Technology Center, without reference to Vilar.<ref name=scandal /><ref name=flee />  In 2005, Vilar was charged with fraud and theft of money from his financial company.<ref name=scandal>{{Cite news | last = Schackner| first =Bill| title =Philanthropy carries a whiff of scandal| newspaper = [[Pittsburgh Post Gazette]]| date = 2005-06-05| url =http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05156/516074-85.stm| accessdate = 2010-05-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | title =Business news briefs: Vilar, W&J trustee, found guilty of fraud| newspaper = [[Pittsburgh Post Gazette]]| date = 2008-11-20| url =http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08325/929284-28.stm| accessdate = 2010-05-10}}</ref>  In a statement in 2005, the college declined to release how much of Vilar's pledge had been fulfilled.<ref name=scandal />

Other, more successful, fundraising vehicles for the construction cost include donations through the "''Revolutionary!

==Planning, design, and construction==
The plans for the four-story Gothic granite building took place during the tenure of [[List of Presidents of Washington & Jefferson College|President]] [[Brian C. Mitchell]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Mitchell Leaves Visible Legacy at W&J| work = W&J Magazine| publisher = Washington & Jefferson College| date = Summer 2004| url = http://www.washjeff.edu/uploadedFiles/External_Relations/For_the_Media/mag_s04_campusnews.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate =2010-05-09 }}</ref>  Like its sister building, [[The Burnett Center]], the architectural plans for the Technology Center were designed by MacLachlan Cornelius & Filoni and the general contracting services were performed by The Landau Building Company.<ref name=sum2003 />  

In 2003, the building was awarded the IMI Golen Award and was a finalist for the Master Builders<U+2019> Association's Excellence in Craftsmanship Award.<ref name=ml>{{Cite web| title = Washington & Jefferson Technology Center| work = | publisher = Marks Landau Construction| year = 2008| url = http://www.markslandau.com/w&j_vilar.html| accessdate = 2010-05-09}}</ref>  Construction on the building was completed in fall 2003.<ref name=sum2003>{{Cite web| title = Vilar Technology Center to Open for Fall Term| work = W&J Magazine| publisher = Washington & Jefferson College| date = Summer 2003| url = http://www.washjeff.edu/uploadedFiles/External_Relations/For_the_Media/sum2003campusnews.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = 2010-05-09}}</ref>
