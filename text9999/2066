The '''Blohm & Voss P.194''' was a design for a mixed-power [[ground-attack aircraft]] and [[tactical bomber]] developed in Germany during World War II.<ref name="Nowarra">{{cite book |last=Nowarra |first=Heinz J. |title=Die Deutsche Luftruestung 1933-1945 Vol.3 - Flugzeugtypen Henschel-Messerschmitt |year=1993 |publisher=Bernard & Graefe Verlag |location=Koblenz |isbn=3-7637-5467-9}}</ref> Like some of [[Richard Vogt (aircraft designer)|Richard Vogt]]'s other designs for [[Blohm & Voss]], the P.194 featured an asymmetric layout. 

Along with the [[Blohm & Voss P.192|P.192]], [[Blohm & Voss P.193|P.193]], and [[Blohm & Voss P.196|P.196]], the P.194 was one of four designs Blohm & Voss submitted in response to a requirement issued by the [[Reich Air Ministry|RLM]] in February 1944 for a replacement for the venerable [[Junkers Ju 87]].<ref name="Myhra 67">Myhra 1998, 67</ref> The basic design of the aircraft echoed that of the [[Blohm & Voss BV 141|BV 141]]: the crew and weapons carried in a nacelle separate from the main [[fuselage]] structure that carried a [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]-driven engine at one end and the [[empennage]] at the other, joined together by a common wing. In the P.194, however, a [[turbojet]] was to be added at the rear of the [[cockpit]] pod and the design intended that the thrust from this engine would help balance the thrust from the propeller. A powerful cluster of guns was to be located in the nose, and a bombload of up to 500&nbsp;kg (1,100&nbsp;lb) was to be carried in an internal [[bomb bay]] in the fuselage.<ref name="Nowarra"/><ref name="Myhra 68">Myhra 1998, 68</ref>
 
All four Blohm & Voss designs were rejected by the RLM, which instead selected the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] to fill the tactical bomber role.<ref name="Myhra 67">Myhra 1998, 67</ref>
