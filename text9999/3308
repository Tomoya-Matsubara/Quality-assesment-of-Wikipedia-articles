'''''United States v. Idaho''''', [[Case citation|533 U.S. 262]] ([[2001]]), was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that the United States, not the state of Idaho, held title to lands submerged under Lake Coeur d'Alene, and that the land was held in trust for the Coeur d'Alene Tribe.<ref>United States v. Idaho, 533 U.S. 262 (2001).</ref>

==Background==
===History===
The [[Coeur d'Alene people|Coeur d'Alene Tribe]] is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] tribe in northern [[Idaho]].  The tribe once inhabited {{convert|3500000|acre|ha}} in northern Idaho and [[Washington (state)|Washington]],<ref>Emmi Blades, ''Using the Legal System to Gain Control of Natural Resources on Tribal Lands: Lessons from the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes and the Coeur D'alene Tribe'', 47 {{smallcaps|Idaho L. Rev.}} 175, 180 (2010).</ref><ref>{{smallcaps|John E. Thorson, Sarah Britton, & Bonnie G. Colby}}, {{smallcaps|Tribal Water Rights: Essays in Contemporary Law, Policy, and Economics}} 27 (2006).</ref> but now resides at the [[Coeur d'Alene Reservation]] in [[Benewah County, Idaho|Benewah]] and [[Kootenai County, Idaho|Kootenai]] counties, Idaho.<ref>United States v. Idaho (In re Coeur d'Alene Lake), 95 F. Supp. 2d 1094 (D. Idaho 1998).</ref>

In 1867, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] established a reservation for the tribe,<ref>Angelique Eaglewoman, ''Tribal Hunting And Fishing Lifeways & Tribal-State Relations In Idaho'' 46 {{smallcaps|Idaho L. Rev.}} 81, 84 (2009).</ref> but the tribe never accepted the reservation due to the main waterways not being included.<ref>United States v. Idaho, 210 F.3d 1067, 1070 (9th Cir. 2000).</ref>  This was due, in a major part, to the fact that the tribe depended on the rivers and the lake for food and other needs.<ref>Blades,  at 180.</ref>  In 1873, the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Commissioner of Indian Affairs]] sent a commission to induce the Coeur d'Alenes to accept a reservation.  Following negotiations, a reservation of approximately {{convert|598000|acres|ha}} was established.<ref>Blades,  at 180.</ref><ref>{{smallcaps|John Arthur Brown}}, {{smallcaps|A Guide to the Indian Tribes of the Pacific Northwest}} 33 (1992).</ref> The reservation boundaries included the Hangman Valley, the [[Coeur d'Alene River]], the [[St. Joe River]], and all but a small portion of [[Lake Coeur d'Alene]].<ref>Idaho, 210 F.3d at 1070.</ref><ref>In re Coeur d'Alene Lake, 95 F. Supp. 2d at 1095.</ref>

The agreement was implemented with an [[executive order]], which was intended to be temporary until [[United States Congress|Congress]] approved it.  Congress never approved the action, and in 1883 the United States conducted a survey of the reservation.  Congress then, in 1886, authorized the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] to negotiate the tribe ceding all of their land outside the reservation.  In 1887 the tribe and the federal government came to an agreement under those terms.<ref>{{smallcaps|Vine Deloria & Raymond J. DeMallie}}, 1 {{smallcaps|Documents of American Indian Diplomacy: Treaties, Agreements, and Conventions, 1775-1979}} 300 (1999).</ref>  In 1889, the tribe ceded the northern third of the reservation back to the federal government, including part of Lake Coeur d'Alene.<ref>{{smallcaps|Brown}},  34.</ref>  The agreement stated that it was not binding until ratified by Congress.<ref>Idaho, 210 F.3d at 1071.</ref><ref>In re Coeur d'Alene Lake, 95 F. Supp. 2d at 1096.</ref>

Prior to ratification of both agreements, Idaho became a state.  Congress passed the Idaho Statehood Act that ratified the state constitution which contained a section disclaiming the state's rights to unappropriated public lands and lands owned by tribes.  In 1891, Congress ratified the earlier agreements with the tribe.  In 1894, the tribe ceded a one-mile wide strip (the "Harrison cession") for use by the [[Washington and Idaho Railway]] to extend its tracks.<ref>Idaho, 533 U.S. at 268.</ref><ref>{{smallcaps|Deloria}},  at 378.</ref> In 1908 Congress gave Idaho an area now known as [[Heyburn State Park]].<ref>Idaho, 210 F.3d at 1072.</ref><ref>In re Coeur d'Alene Lake, 95 F. Supp. 2d at 1097.</ref>

This area of Idaho was known for mining and has long held the nickname of "Silver Valley."<ref>Blades,  at 181.</ref>  From 1880-1980 the Coeur d'Alene basin was one of the most productive [[silver]], [[lead]], and [[zinc]] mining regions in the country.<ref>Blades,  at 182.</ref>  The waste, estimated at 72 million tons,<ref>{{smallcaps|Daniel Scott Murphree}}, {{smallcaps|Native America}} 291 (2012).</ref><ref>{{smallcaps|Thorson}},  at 27.</ref> from the mining contaminated downstream waters, including the Coeur d'Alene River and Lake Coeur d'Alene.  As of 2012, the Silver Valley was the second largest [[Superfund]] cleanup site in the nation.

===Prior court action===
{{seealso|Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho}}
In 1991, after failing to reach an agreement with Idaho on a greater role in the management of the lake, the tribe notified the state of its intent to sue for title.<ref>Blades,  at 184.</ref><ref>Sarah Krakoff, ''Undoing Indian Law One Case at a Time: Judicial Minimalism and Tribal Sovereignty'' 50 {{smallcaps|Am. U.L. Rev.}} 1177, 1246 (2001).</ref><ref>{{smallcaps|Brown}},  35.</ref>  The case was brought in the [[United States District Court for the District of Idaho|U.S. District Court]] which initially held that a suit by the tribe against the state was barred by the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]].<ref>Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho v. Idaho, 798 F. Supp. 1443 (D. Idaho 1992).</ref>  The tribe then appealed the decision to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court]].  The Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part<ref>Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho v. Idaho, 42 F.3d 1244 (9th Cir. 1994).</ref> and the state appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In the Supreme Court, [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Anthony Kennedy]] delivered the majority opinion which held that the Eleventh Amendment barred direct lawsuits by tribes against a state.<ref>Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S. 261 (1997).</ref><ref>Krakoff,  at 1246.</ref>  The decision was 5-4, with [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]] and Justices [[Sandra Day O'Connor|O'Connor]], [[Antonin Scalia|Scalia]], and [[Clarence Thomas|Thomas]] joining Kennedy.  Justice [[David Souter]] dissented, joined by Justices [[John P. Stevens|Stevens]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]], and [[Stephen Breyer|Breyer]].<ref>Krakoff,  at 1247.</ref>

The tribe then requested that the United States sue to [[quiet title]] to the submerged land on the reservation.<ref>Blades,  at 184-185.</ref>  The tribe moved to intervene on the side of the United States and the court granted the request.  The court found that the earlier agreements had reserved the submerged land for the use of the tribe, and ruled for the United States.<ref>Idaho, 210 F.3d at 1072.</ref><ref>In re Coeur d'Alene Lake, 95 F. Supp. 2d at 1116.</ref>

The state then appealed the ruling to the Ninth Circuit Court.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed the decision of the trial court, pointing out additional information that supported the lower court's ruling that was not in the District Court's memorandum opinion.<ref>Idaho, 210 F.3d at 1081.</ref> 

The state again appealed and the Supreme Court granted ''[[certiorari]]''.

==Opinion of the court==
[[File:DavidSouter.jpg|thumb|left|200px|alt=photograph of Justice David Souter|Justice David Souter, author of the majority opinion]]
===Arguments===
Steven W. Strack argued the cause for the state of Idaho.  David C. Frederick argued the cause for the United States, and Raymond C. Givens argued the cause for the Couer d'Alene tribe.

===Opinion of the court===
[[File:William Rehnquist.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=photograph of Chief Justice William Rehnquist|Chief Justice William Rehnquist, author of the dissent]]
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the court.  This decision was the opposite of the earlier decision in [[Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho]], with Justice O'Connor now voting with the dissenters in that case.  Basically repeating his earlier dissent, Souter noted that the presumption was that the state had ownership of all submerged lands, unless it was clear that the United States had reserved those lands for itself.<ref>Blades,  at 183.</ref>  Souter observed that the 1873 executive order implicitly included the submerged lands and also noted that the 1888 report to Congress indicated that all of the submerged lands were retained in trust for the tribe, and that Congress knew this when they passed the Idaho statehood act.<ref>Blades,  at 186.</ref>  He also noted the trial court's finding that the federal government had consistently treated with the tribe over the submerged lands, including compensating the tribe for the railroad right of way.  In this case it was clear that the United States had retained the rights of title to the submerged land, overcoming the presumption of state ownership.  The decision of the Court of Appeals was affirmed, that the United States held title to the land.<ref>Idaho, 533 U.S. at 281-288.</ref><ref>{{smallcaps|Thorson}},  at 28.</ref>

===Dissent===

Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented from the majority opinion.  He stated that once the Idaho statehood act was passed, the title to the submerged lands transferred to the state.  Any subsequent look at actions of the Congress, even in ratifying agreements that antedated statehood were of no consequence, and should not have been considered by the majority.  The only action that would have retained tribal and federal ownership of the submerged lands would have been an action prior to Idaho becoming a state.  He would have reversed and remanded the case.<ref>Idaho, 533 U.S. at 275-281.</ref><ref>{{smallcaps|Thorson}},  at 29.</ref>

===Subsequent developments===
A year after the decision, the tribe applied to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) for authority to enforce water standards under the [[Clean Water Act]].<ref>Blades,  at 189.</ref>  Negotiations with the state, the tribe and the EPA began but broke down when both the state and the EPA could not match the $5,000,000 budget provided by the tribe.<ref>{{smallcaps|Thorson}},  at 29.</ref>  In 2005, the EPA granted this authority, allowing the tribe to regulate non-menbers as necessary for the health and welfare of the tribe.  The three parties came together again, and after arbitration, agreed on a management plan in 2009.<ref>Blades,  at 199.</ref>

In addition, the tribe has been in the forefront in filing cleanup lawsuits against mining companies, while state and federal politicians have moved to limit the damages that could be collected.<ref>{{smallcaps|Tim Palmer}}, {{smallcaps|The Heart of America: Our Landscape, Our Future}} 217 (1999).</ref>
