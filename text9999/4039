'''The Baltimore City College''' ('''BCC'''), also referred to as '''The Castle on the Hill''',  historically '''The College''', and most commonly '''City''', is a public [[college-preparatory]] [[magnet school]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], [[United States|U.S.]] Despite its name, the school is not a college as it lacks the authority to confer baccalaureate degrees. The City College curriculum includes the [[International Baccalaureate Programme]] and emphasizes study in the [[classics]] and [[liberal arts]]. Admission to City College is competitive. Applicants from Baltimore and the surrounding area are evaluated using a combination of grades and standardized test scores. 

Established in 1839 as an all-male institution, City College is the third oldest public [[high school]] in the United States, predated by the [[English High School of Boston]] (1829) and the [[Central High School of Philadelphia]] (1836).<ref name="wjz">{{cite web |url=http://wjz.com/local/local_story_115213044.html |title=City College Designated A Baltimore Landmark |accessdate=2007-07-29 |last=Kartalija |first=Jessica |date=[[2007-04-25]] |publisher=CBS Broadcasting Inc}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/community/guide/bal-rg-learnoverview,0,5643451.story?coll=bal-relocation-features |title=Contrasting studies |accessdate=2007-07-29 |last=Anft |first=Michael |date= |publisher=The Baltimore Sun}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://baltimore.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/2000/01/31/focus2.html |title=School boundaries |accessdate=2007-07-29 |last=Katz-Stone |first=Adam |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=[[2007-01-28]] |publisher=Baltimore Business Journal}}</ref> The school was located in three different buildings in [[downtown Baltimore]] before relocating in 1928 to its current 38-[[acre]] (153,781&nbsp;[[square metre|m<U+00B2>]]) campus at 33rd Street and The Alameda in the [[Waverly, Baltimore|Waverly]] neighborhood of north Baltimore.

== History ==
{{main|History of Baltimore City College}}

[[Image:City College2.jpg|right|thumb|Rendering of school on Holliday and Fayette Streets circa 1869]]

The creation of a male high school "in which the higher branches of English and classical literature only should be taught", was authorized unanimously by the [[City Council]] of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] on [[March 7]], [[1839]].<ref>Steiner (1894), p. 207.</ref>  Accordingly, a building on what was then Courtland Street (now Preston Gardens at St. Paul Place) was acquired to serve as the new high school. The school opened it doors on [[October 20]], [[1839]] with 46&nbsp;students and 1&nbsp;teacher, [[Nathan C. Brooks]].  The school was housed in three different locations in its first three&nbsp;years of existence before returning to the original building on Courtland Street.  Finally, in 1843 the city council allocated $23,000 to acquire the Assembly Rooms at the northwestern corner of Fayette and Holliday Streets for the school.<ref>Steiner (1894), p. 208.</ref>  In 1850, the city council granted the board of school commissioners the right to confer graduates of the school with certificates, and the following year the school held its first [[commencement]] ceremony in 1851.<ref>Steiner (1894), p. 209.</ref>   

In 1865, in accordance with a recommendation from the Board of Commissioners of the Baltimore City public schools, the school began offering a five-year track,<ref name="37th Report">{{cite book | last = Board of Commissioners of Public Schools | title =37th Annual Report of the Board of Commissioners of Public Schools to the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore | publisher = James Young | date = 1866 | location = Baltimore | pages = pp. 105-106 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=BSwTAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA29&dq=%22Central+High+School%22+report+1866#PPA1,M1 | accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> as part of a process aimed at elevating the school to the status of a college so that it could grant its graduates baccalaureate degrees.  The following year on [[October 9]], [[1866]], as another part of this process, the school was renamed "The Baltimore City College" (BCC) by act of the city council.  The city council failed to take any further action, and although the school changed nominally, it was never granted the power to confer [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees.<ref>Steiner (1894), p. 218.</ref> 

The building on Fayette and Holliday Streets had been in a state of decline for two&nbsp;decades. It was not until 1873, when a fire spread from the Holliday Street Theater to the "Assembly Rooms", that the city council finally decided to expend the resources to erect a building for City College.  A lot was acquired on Howard Street opposite Centre Street and the city council allocated $150,000 for the construction of the new building.<ref>Steiner (1894), p. 220.</ref>  The new English [[Gothic revival]]-styled building was dedicated on [[February 1]], [[1875]] and the school moved in the following week.<ref>Steiner (1894), p. 221.</ref>  

[[Image:BCC2007.JPG|thumb|left|Baltimore City College, 2007]]

The Tudor Gothic building which housed the school lasted until 1892, when it was undermined by the construction of the [[Baltimore & Ohio Railroad]] tunnel from Camden Station to Mount Royal Station and collapsed.<ref>{{cite journal | title = A nintey-six ton electric locomotive | journal = Scientific American | volume = | issue = | date =[[1895-08-10]] | url = http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/stbando.Html | accessdate = 2007-07-13 }}</ref>  In 1895, a new structure, designed by the architects Baldwin and Pennington, was erected on the site.  This new building quickly became overcrowded and an annex was established on 26th Street.  The addition did not help with the increase in school-aged youth beginning to attend City College by [[World War I]].  During the 1920s, alumni began a campaign to provide the school with a more suitable building, and in 1926 ground was broken for a massive Collegiate [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] stone castle at 33rd Street and The Alameda.  This new structure cost almost $3&nbsp;million.<ref>Leonhart (1939), p. 20.</ref> 

The school began admitting [[African-American]] students following the landmark ruling ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''.  In September 1954, {{nowrap|10 African-American students}} entered City College.<ref>{{Citation | author = Hlubb, Julius G. | title = An Analysis of Student Enrollment at the Baltimore City College | publisher = Diss. George Washington University| page=10 | date = 1965}}</ref> The administration also sent two African-American men, Eugene Parker and Pierre Davis, to teach at school in 1956.  Parker taught at City College for 30&nbsp;years and Davis, after teaching for one&nbsp;year, returned as the school's first black principal in 1971.<ref name="Daneker 38">Daneker (1988), p. 38.</ref>

In 1978, after having undergone its first major capital renovations, the high school welcomed women for the first time.  The all-male tradition did not end easily; alumni had argued for the uniqueness of a single-sex educational system and convinced the task force studying the issue to vote 11<U+2013>6 in favor of keeping the all-male tradition.  The Board of School Commissioners, in a reversal, voted to admit women citing [[U.S. Constitution|constitutional]] concerns.<ref>Daneker (1988), p. 58.</ref>

==Campus==
[[Image:City aerial.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial Photograph of Baltimore City College]]

City College stands on a 38-[[acre]] (153,781&nbsp;[[square metre|m<U+00B2>]]) campus in northeast Baltimore at the intersection of 33rd street and the Alameda.<ref>Leonhart (1939), p. 120.</ref>  The campus consists of two&nbsp;buildings, the Gothic-style edifice known locally as the "Castle on the Hill" that sits in the center of the campus, and the power plant building east of the castle.  In addition to providing the building's utilities, the power plant originally housed five work shops: an electrical shop, a mechanical shop, a metal shop,  a printing shop, and a wood shop.<ref>Leonhart (1939), p. 124.</ref>  Only the main building is in academic use by the school.  Both buildings were designed by the architecture firm of Buckler and Fenhagen.  Just south of the main building is Alumni Field, the school's stadium, which serves as home to the [[American football|football]], boy's and girl's lacrosse and track teams. During a major building renovation in 1978 a modern gymnasium was added to the southwest corner of the main building.

On [[June 30]], [[2003]], the current building was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 6/30/03 through 7/05/03 | publisher = [[National Park Service]] | date = [[2003-07-11]] | url = http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20030711.htm | accessdate = 2007-07-23 }}</ref>  The listing of the building coincided with its 75th anniversary.  The previous location of the school on Howard Street is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<ref>{{cite web | title = National Register of Historic Places | url = http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/MD/Baltimore/state.html | accessdate = 2007-07-23}}</ref>  On [[April 24]], [[2007]] the Castle on the Hill earned the additional distinction of being a Baltimore City Landmark.  This new status means that the building<U+2019>s exterior cannot be altered without approval of the city Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation.<ref>{{cite news | last=Janis | first=Stephen | title=Baltimore City College honored as official landmark | publisher=The Examiner | date=[[2007-04-24]] | accessdate=2007-05-22 | url=http://www.examiner.com/a-690996~Baltimore_City_College_honored_as_official_landmark.html}}</ref>

==Academics==
[[Image:1bccinfotech07.jpg|thumb|left|City College students at their Information Technology class]]

Throughout most of the 20th century the [[college preparatory]] curriculum at City College was divided into two tracks: the "A" course and the "B" course.  Though both tracks were intended to provide students with the skills necessary for college, the "A" course was intended to be more rigorous.  In the early 1990s, Principal Joseph Antenson removed the two tier system because he believed it to be racially discriminatory.<ref name="End_IB">{{cite web | title = A Request to End International Baccalaureate at the Baltimore City College | publisher = Baltimore City College Alumni Association | date = May 2007 | url = http://www.cityforever.org/BCCAA_Spring_2_Newsletter2007.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-07-16}}</ref>  In 1998, the academic program took on the general form in which it exists today, when Principal Joseph M. Wilson introduced the [[IB Diploma Program|International Baccalaureate Diploma Program]] (IB Program) into the 11th and 12th grade curricula.<ref name="IBO">{{cite web | title =Baltimore City College IB Profile | publisher =[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] | url = http://www.ibo.org/school/001014/ | accessdate = 2007-07-13 }}</ref>   The IB Program is a comprehensive, liberal arts program that must be completed in students<U+2019> junior and senior years.  Students now have the option to pursue a standard college preparatory curriculum, the IB Program, or a combination of the two.   

In 2007, opposition to the continuation of the IB Program arose.  Members of the Baltimore City College Alumni Association argued that the IB Program was diverting a significant amount of the school's resources, in order to benefit a fraction of the student population.<ref name="Elite_Program">{{cite news| last=Neufeld| first=Sara| title=Elite Program in Dispute| publisher=The Baltimore Sun| date=[[2007-02-10]] |  page=Final Edition,1A| url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/education/837382/elite_program_in_dispute/index.html | accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>  Only approximately 30&nbsp;students are in the full IB Diploma Program at City College.   Some members also argued that the rigidity of the program did not give students enough flexibility.  Citing these concerns, the alumni association encouraged the school to replace the IB Program with the "A course" and expand the number of [[Advanced Placement Program| Advanced Placement]] courses offered.<ref name="Elite_Program"/>  The alumni association's recommendation, though non-binding, was intended to persuade the school to terminate the IB program and replace it with a more equitable and flexible curriculum.  Nevertheless, the school administration is moving ahead with plans to expand the IB Program by incorporating the [[IB Middle Years Program]] into the 9th and 10th grade curricula.<ref name="End_IB"/>    

In addition to the 23&nbsp;IB courses,<ref name="IBO"/> the school offers {{nowrap|six Advanced Placement courses}}.  Both programs have contributed to the academic ranking of the school.  In the 1999<U+2013>2000 academic year, City College was recognized by the [[U.S. Department of Education]] as a National Blue Ribbon School.<ref name="2000 report">{{cite web | title = The Baltimore City Public School System 2000 Annual Report | publisher =[[Baltimore City Public School System]] | date = 2000 | format=PDF | url = http://www.bcps.k12.md.us/About/PDF/2000_AR_p1.pdf | accessdate = 2007-07-16}}</ref>  In June 2005, the ''Johns Hopkins Magazine'' reported that the [[Johns Hopkins University]] had awarded full time, four-year scholarships to ten&nbsp;seniors. <ref>{{cite web | last=Blackburn| first=Maria| title = Locally Grown| publisher =''Johns Hopkins Magazine'' | date = 2005| format=PDF  | url = http://nasc.jhu.edu/pdf/jhu_magazine.pdf| accessdate = 2007-08-11}}</ref> In the May 2007, ''[[Newsweek]]'' report of the nation's top 1200&nbsp;schools, City College was ranked 258<ref name="Newsweek1"/> and in the 2006 report the school was ranked 206.<ref name="Newsweek2"/>  The expansion of the number of  AP and IB courses offered allowed City to perform well in the ''Newsweek'' rankings, which are based heavily on the number of AP and IB courses offered.

Students wishing to enroll in City College must apply in the 8th grade.  Enrollment is open to both residents and non-residents of Baltimore City, though non-residents must pay tuition.  Eligibility is based on a composite score that is determined by the Baltimore City Public School System. The school system generates the composite score based on a student's grades in the 7th grade and first quarter of the 8th grade, and a student's performance on a national standardized test, with the student's grades receiving double the weight as the test scores.<ref>{{cite web | title = Choosing the High School that is right for you | publisher = Baltimore City Public School System | date = 2007 | url = http://www.bcps.k12.md.us/Students/pdf/Highschool_guide_0809.pdf| format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-12-11}}</ref>  

The enrollment at City College in 2007 was 1353&nbsp;students.  Of those students, 504 were males representing approximately 37.25% of the student populations, and the remaining 849&nbsp;students were females, representing approximately 62.75% of the student population.  The 1229&nbsp;students who identified themselves as African-American comprised 90.84% of the student population.  An additional 105&nbsp;students identified themselves as white, comprising 7.76% of the student population.  The remaining 1.4% of the population identified themselves as Hispanic, Asian, or American Indian.<ref>{{cite web | title = 2007 Maryland Report Card | publisher = Maryland State Board of Education | date = [[2007-07-11]] | url = http://www.mdreportcard.org/Demographics.aspx?K=300480&WDATA=school%7c2005#enrollment | accessdate = 2007-07-25}}</ref>

==Extracurricular activities==

City College offers over 20&nbsp;student clubs and organizations. These activities include chapters of national organizations such as [[National Honor Society]] (established at City in 1927) and [[Quill and Scroll]]. City College offers service clubs such as the [[Red Cross]] Club and Campus Improvement Association.<ref name="2007Greenbag">{{cite book | last = Baltimore City College | first = editor | title = The 2007 Green Bag | date = 2007 | pages =pp. 16-19}}</ref>   In addition, City offers clubs and activities including Drama which holds the annual play, Art, [[Model UN]], Band, and Dance. Other unique clubs and activities include One City One Book, an organization that invites the entire school community to read one book selected by faculty and invites the author of the book for a reading, discussion, and question and answer period.<ref name="2007Greenbag"/>  In 2007, [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner, [[MacArthur Fellow]], and [[novelist]] [[Edward P. Jones]] discussed his book ''Lost in the City''. Moreover, the campus school store is completely student run and managed by the [[Student Government]]. One of City College's most notable academic teams is the [[It's Academic]] team which participates on the It's Academic TV Show.<ref name="2007Greenbag"/>

===Bancroft and Carrollton-Wight Literary Societies===
{{main|Bancroft Literary Association and Carrollton-Wight Literary Society}}

The origins of the speech and debate program at City College lie in the Bancroft Literary Association, which was established in 1876.<ref name="Leonhart_233">Leonhart (1939), p. 233.</ref>  In 1878, a second competing society, the Carrollton Literary Society, was established.<ref name="Leonhart_233"/>  That society was later renamed the Carrollton-Wight Literary Society, after its first faculty adviser, Professor Charles Wight.  The two&nbsp;societies competed through the 1960s but became dormant in the late 1970s.<ref>Daneker (1988), p. 66.</ref>  

In 1997, the two societies were resurrected as the Baltimore City College speech and debate team.<ref name="Abell">{{cite web | publisher=The Abell Foundation | title=Speech & Debate Program | url=http://www.abell.org/abellprograms/speech.html | accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref>  The speech team has retained the name of the Bancroft Society and the debate team has retained the name of the Carrollton-Wight Society.

[[Mock trial]] was not a traditional part of the literary societies, but it has been incorporated into the speech and debate program.<ref name="Abell"/>  In 2006, City College defeated the 2005 State Champion Squad from [[Richard Montgomery High School]] to advance to the semifinals of state championship,<ref>{{cite web| title=Educational Briefs| publisher=Owings Mills Times | date=[[2007]]-[[04-26]] | url=http://news.mywebpal.com/news_tool_v2.cfm?pnpid=809&show=archivedetails&ArchiveID=1181413&om=1 |accessdate=2007-12-29}}</ref> but was later defeated by local rival the [[Park School of Baltimore]], which advanced to the final trial.

===Band===

[[Image:CityPolyhalftime.jpg|thumb|right|Baltimore City College Marching Knights' halftime show at M&T Bank Stadium, November 10. 2007]]
The marching band at City College was created in the late 1950s. At the time, the instrumental music program consisted of the [[orchestra]], [[concert band]] and [[marching band]]. In 1954, Professor Charles M. Stengstacke directed a 65&nbsp;member concert band that doubled as a marching band in the fall. During halftime performances at home the band would form the shape of a heart or a car, but always ending the performance by forming the letters C-I-T-Y.<ref>Sirota (1954), p. 63.</ref> In 1994, Alvin T. Wallace became Band Director.  During his tenure, a wind ensemble was added and the marching band grew to include over 150&nbsp;members. In 1999, the band swept the top categories in the [[Disney World]] high school band competition.<ref name="2000 report"/>  In 2006, the wind ensemble received a grade of superior at the district adjudication festival and marched in the Baltimore Mayor's Christmas Day Parade.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mayorschristmasparade.com/baltimore/christmas_parade_floats.html|title= The Mayor's Annual Christmas Day Parade|accessdate=2007-08-11 |Mayor's Christmas Parade Committee, Baltimore}}</ref> 

[[Image:Bccchoir.JPG|thumb|left|The choir performing the "[[Battle Hymn of the Republic]]" at the school's 2006 Hall of Fame Assembly]]

===Choir===
The City College [[choir]] was founded in 1950 by Professor Donald Regier.  Originally a co-curricular subject with only 18&nbsp;members, by 1954 it had developed into a major subject of study with 74&nbsp;students enrolled.<ref>Sirota (1954), p. 62.</ref>
Under the direction of Linda Hall, today's choir consists of four&nbsp;groups: the Mixed Chorus, the Concert Choir, the Singin'/Swingin' Knights, and the Knights and Daze Show Choir.<ref name="choir">{{cite web | last =Fahey | first =Richard | title =Mellifluous Melodies:City College High Choir continues to make sweet music | publisher = Baltimore City Public School System | date =2007 | url = http://www.bcps.k12.md.us/news/pdf/bced_Spr_2007_FINAL.pdf | format =PDF | accessdate = 2007-07-26 }}</ref> The Mixed Choir is opened to all students at City College and currently has a membership of approximately 135&nbsp;students.  The Concert Choir is a more selective group consisting of about 50&nbsp;students, who must audition for their places in the choir.  The Singin'/Swingin' Knights is an even more selective group composed of 25&nbsp;students.  The Knights and Daze Show Choir is a group of students, who perform a [[choreography|choreographed]] dance routine while they sing.  With the exception of the Knights and Daze Show Choir, which performs [[jazz]] and [[pop music]], the choir's repertoire consists of [[gospel music]], [[spiritual (music)|spirituals]],<ref name="choir"/> and the classics of composers like [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] and Practorious.

The choir has traveled to [[Europe]] on several occasions; its first trip was in 1999, after receiving an invitation to perform at the Choralfest in [[Arezzo]], [[Italy]].<ref name="italy"> {{cite web | title = A public school victory | publisher = Baltimore Business Journal | date =[[1999-05-07]] | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/1999/05/10/editorial2.html | accessdate = 2007-07-26 }}</ref>  In 2003, the choir returned to Italy to perform at the annual Conference of the Parties of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]].<ref name="choir"/>  The choir has also performed in France and Spain.<ref name="choir"/> 

On [[October 2]], [[2007]], the Weill Institute of Music at [[Carnegie Hall]] announced that the City College choir was one of four high school choirs selected to participate in the National High School Choral Festival on [[March 10]], [[2008]].  The four&nbsp;choirs will perform [[Johannes Brahms]]' ''[[A German Requiem]]'' under the direction of [[Craig Jessop]], [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]] Director.

===Athletics===

[[Image:Girls lacrosse 010.jpg|thumb|right|Women's lacrosse in match against [[Digital Harbor High School]] Spring, 2007]]
During the late 1880s, inter-scholastic sports became a feature of school life and a number of teams were begun in various sports.  The formal organization of an athletic program did not occur until 1895.<ref>Leonhart (1939), p. 198</ref>  During the early years of the athletic program, City College played mainly against college teams because few other secondary schools existed in Maryland.  The 1895 football schedule included [[St. John's College]], [[Swarthmore College]], the [[United States Naval Academy]], [[University of Maryland]], and [[Washington College]].<ref name="leonhart200">Leonhart (1939), p. 200.</ref>  
The current City College athletic program  consists of six men's varsity teams, seven women's varsity teams, and five [[coeducational]] teams.  The men's sports played are [[baseball]], [[basketball]], [[american football|football]], [[lacrosse]], [[soccer]], and [[scholastic wrestling|wrestling]].  The women's teams are [[badminton]], [[basketball]], [[lacrosse]], [[soccer]], [[softball]], [[volleyball]].  The five [[co-ed]] teams are [[cross country running]], indoor [[track and field]], [[swimming]], [[track and field]], and [[tennis]]. 

====Football====
{{main|Baltimore City College football}}

The football program began in the 1880s, yet at the time the school faced mainly collegiate opponents, since few other schools in the area fielded teams.<ref name="leonhart200"/>  By the early 1900s this trend shifted, and the team began competing with other high schools.  Between 1936 and 1940, under coach Harry Lawrence, City College remained undefeated for 38&nbsp;consecutive games, which included 35&nbsp;wins, three&nbsp;ties, and four state championships.<ref>{{cite book | last = Harris | first =Murray, editor | title = The 1940 Green Bag | publisher = The 1940 Senior Class | date = 1940| location =Baltimore}}</ref>  In 1959, [[George Young (football executive)|George Young]], who would later become the [[general manager]] of the [[New York Giants]], became head coach of the team.  Young coached City College to a total of six Maryland state championships.  He left after the 1967 season to become an offensive line coach for the [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]].<ref name="Marudas">{{cite book | last = Marudas | first = Kyriakos| title = The City-Poly Game | publisher= Gateway Press | date = 1988 | location = Baltimore | pages = 66}}</ref>       

In 1975, George Petrides, a City College alumnus, became head coach of the football team and has remained in this position for 32&nbsp;years.<ref name="NFL">{{cite web | publisher=[[National Football League]] | title=George Petrides of Baltimore City College Honored as Ravens HS Coach of the Week - September 11, 2006 | accessdate=2006-09-19 | url=http://www.nflhs.com/nflprograms/coachofweek/ravenscow_09112006_jjc.asp}}</ref>  During his tenure, Petrides led the team through a 29&nbsp;game winning streak&mdash;the longest consecutive winning streak in the history of Maryland football&mdash;and to two consecutive Maryland Scholastic Association A Conference championships in 1991 and 1992.<ref name="Kane">{{cite paper | first = Gregory | last = Kane | title = Speaking of streaks, this one's even longer | publisher = The Baltimore Sun | date = [[2001-02-10]] | url = http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/bal-md.kane10feb10,0,6628231.column?coll=bal-local-columnists | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref>  On [[September 11]], [[2006]], Petrides was honored as the [[Baltimore Ravens]] ''High School Coach of the Week'' for the third time.<ref name="NFL"/>

====City<U+2013>Poly football rivalry====
{{main|City<U+2013>Poly football rivalry}}

The City<U+2013>Poly football rivalry is the oldest [[American football]] rivalry in Maryland, and one of the [[List of high school football rivalries|oldest public school football rivalries]] in the U.S.<ref name="Patterson">{{cite book | last = Patterson | first = Ted | title = Football in Baltimore: History and Memorabilia | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | date = 2000 | location =Baltimore | pages =p. 7}}</ref>  The rivalry began in 1889, when City College met the [[Baltimore Polytechnic Institute]] (Poly) at Clifton park for a football scrimmage.<ref>Leonhart (1939), p. 219.</ref>  Little is known about the first game, except that it was played between the City JV team and Poly with City emerging as the victor.<ref name="Patterson"/>  City remained undefeated in the series until 1908.<ref>Leonhart (1939), p. 221.</ref>  In November 2006, City and Poly clashed in the 118th City<U+2013>Poly football game.<ref name="DiBlasi">{{cite web | last=DiBlasi | first=Joe | publisher= Word Smith Media Ventures | title=City-Poly | date=[[2006-11-09]] | accessdate=2007-07-26 | url=http://www.pressboxonline.com/story.cfm?id=1117}}</ref> 

One of the most memorable City<U+2013>Poly games occurred on [[Thanksgiving Day]] 1965, at Baltimore's [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]], with some 25,000&nbsp;fans in attendance. City beat Poly 52&ndash;6, and completed a 10&ndash;0 season with the team being ranked eighth in the nation by a national sports poll.<ref>{{cite book | last = Strasburger | first =Victor, editor | title = The 1967 Green Bag | date = 1967 | pages =p. 19}}</ref>  City's 52&ndash;6 victory over Poly in that game is the largest margin of victory in the history of the series.<ref name="DiBlasi"/>  Former Baltimore Mayor [[Kurt Schmoke]] was the [[quarterback]] and Maryland Delegate [[Curt Anderson]] was the captain of that team. The game is no longer played on Thanksgiving or at Memorial Stadium, but is now located at the home of the [[Baltimore Ravens]], [[M&T Bank Stadium]], in downtown Baltimore. With 2007's 26&ndash;20 win by City, Poly leads the series 58&ndash;54&ndash;6 (counting the first 15&nbsp;scrimmages won by City).

====Lacrosse====

The lacrosse program at City College is the oldest high school lacrosse program in the state of Maryland.<ref>{{cite web | title = Lacrosse in Maryland | publisher = Maryland Online Encyclopedia | url = http://www.mdoe.org/lacrosse.html | accessdate = 2007-07-16}}</ref>  The informal playing of lacrosse began at the school in 1879, when a group of students decided to field a team; this continued annually until 1891.<ref name="lacrosse">{{cite book | last = Fisher | first = Donald M. | title = Lacrosse: A History of the Game | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | date = 2002 | location = Baltimore | pages =p. 83| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=N8dQ11uQxrQC&pg=PA83&ots=i7u8rXW_VW&dq=%22city+college%22+lacrosse&sig=AGg_qVjRSndjbwcvFLzd-hpl_zQ | accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> In 1902, lacrosse became a permanent part of the school's athletic program.  During the program's inception, City College played against collegiate lacrosse teams, including Johns Hopkins University.  It was not until City's rival Poly fielded a team in 1912 that the school had high school opponents.<ref name="lacrosse"/>  At least 10&nbsp;former members of the mens lacrosse team are in the [[National Lacrosse Hall of Fame]]. Currently, both men's and women's lacrosse are played at City.

==Student publications==
[[Image:Green Bag.jpg|thumb|right|''The 2006 Green Bag'']]
===''The Green Bag''===
''The Green Bag'' is the senior class annual at City College.  Published continuously since 1896, ''The Green Bag'' is the oldest publication still in existence at the school.<ref>Leonhart (1939), p. 237.</ref>  G. Warfield Hobbs Jr., president of the 1896 senior class and first editor-in-chief of the ''Green Bag'', gave the publication its name in recognition of the role of City College graduates in political leadership.  Historically, the political appointees of the [[Governor of Maryland]] have been known as the "green bag", though the derivation of the term is unknown.<ref>{{cite web | title= The History of Maryland's Green Bag | publisher=Maryland State Archives | date=2003 | url=http://speccol.mdarchives.state.md.us/msa/speccol/catalog/topics/html/green_bag.html |accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>  The first yearbooks contained sketches of faculty and seniors, and included recollections, anecdotes, stories, and quotes significant to the student body. Underclassmen were included for the first time in 1948.  In 2007, ''The Green Bag'' released its first full-color edition.<ref>{{cite book | last = Baltimore City College | title = The 2007 Green Bag v. 111 | date = 2006 | location = | pages = p. 3}}</ref> 

The most controversial issue of the ''Green Bag'' was published in 1900 when Members of the senior class used the annual to make fun of their professors.  The school board attempted to censor the edition by requiring the ''Green Bag'' to be reviewed by Principal Francis Soper.  The yearbook had already been printed, and in defiance of the school board, the editors refused to have the edition censored and reprinted.  The school board responded by withholding the diplomas of six of the editors and the business manager and by preventing the school from holding a public commencement ceremony.  One of the boys expelled, Clarence Keating Bowie, became a member of the school board in 1926.<ref>Leonhart (1939), p. 77.</ref>

[[Image:Collegian.jpg|thumb|left|''The Collegian'', Vol. 77.1]]

===''The Collegian''===

''The Collegian'' has been the school newspaper of City College since its first publication as a bi-weekly [[newspaper]] in 1929.<ref name="leonhart126">Leonhart (1939), p. 126.</ref>   Though several other publications existed in 1929, ''The Collegian'' is the only publication other than the ''Green Bag'' still printed.  Originally, the paper was both managed and printed by students.  During the 1930s, ''The Collegian'' won numerous awards including second place in the [[Columbia Scholastic Press Association]]'s annual contest for five&nbsp;years in a row.<ref name="leonhart126"/>  In recent years, the publication has waned.  Budget cuts have reduced the number of issues printed, and students no longer write for the paper as an extracurricular activity.  Instead the paper is produced by students enrolled in the [[journalism]] course.  Citing the decline of ''The Collegian'' and increasing disorder in the school, several students started an underground publication entitled ''Omnibus'' in May 2007.<ref>{{cite web | last = Goldman | first =Leah | coauthors =Maia Gottlieb | title = Uni nationi non dividendae, cum libertate iustitiaque omnibus | date =[[2007-05-22]] | url =http://www.bccomnibus.com/MayIssue.pdf | format =PDF | accessdate =2007-08-01}}</ref>

==Alumni association==
[[Image:1bcchof.jpg|thumb|right|2007 Hall of Fame ceremony]]
The Baltimore City College Alumni Association (BCCAA) was established in 1866 as a support network for City College.  The BCCAA holds an annual meeting at the school every November and its Board of Governors meets the first Monday of each month at the school.<br />
The BCCAA publishes the class reunion guide, established and maintains an endowment fund, awards alumni scholarships, conducts the Hall of Fame selection and induction, publishes a quarterly newsletter, maintains an alumni data base and assists with numerous projects designed to enrich student life and improve the facility.  The endowment assets remain at more than $1&nbsp;million with more than 30&nbsp;college scholarships awarded every year to graduating seniors.<ref>{{Citation| first =Jacob| last =Howard| title =Serving the BCC Community since 1866| year =2007| page=4| place =Baltimore, Md.| publisher =Baltimore City College Alumni Association}}</ref>

The Baltimore City College Hall of Fame induction ceremony is held every October.  Alumni who have demonstrated extraordinary service to the school, the city, state, country or the world are selected to become members with former inductees, alumni and students attending the two-hour ceremony.  One of the 2007 inductees was Robert Hormats, a Vice-President at [[Goldman Sachs]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/business/hancock/blog/2007/09/the.html|title=Baltimore City College's all-star alumni |accessdate=2007-11-29 |last=Hancock |first=Jay |date= |publisher=The Baltimore Sun}}</ref>
