Located at the southern tip of [[Ellesmere Island]], Grise Fiord is one of three permanent settlements on the island. Grise Fiord lies {{convert|1160|km|abbr=on}} north of the [[Arctic Circle]].

Grise Fiord lies in the [[Arctic Cordillera]] [[mountain range]] which is the only major mountain system east of the [[Canadian Rockies]].

===Crime and safety===
A [[Simon Fraser University]] study of [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) activity in the Baffin Region states that Grise Fiord had the lowest rate of criminal offences of all communities looked at in 1992,<ref>Curt Taylor Griffiths, Gregory Saville, Darryl S. Wood, and Evelyn Zellerer. ''POLICING THE BAFFIN REGION, N.W.T.: Findings From the Eastern Arctic Crime and Justice Study'', 1995 [http://www.justiceexpert.com/pdfs/Policing%20in%20the%20Arctic.pdf]</ref> and cites a 1994 [[Statistics Canada]] survey that gives the highest perception of personal safety.<ref>"Aboriginal

==History==
===Settlement===
[[File:Grise Fiord harbour.jpg|thumb|Grise Fiord Harbour]]
{{Main|High Arctic relocation}}
The settlement (and [[Resolute, Nunavut|Resolute]]) was created by the Canadian government in 1953, partly to assert sovereignty in the High Arctic during the [[Cold War]]. Eight Inuit families from [[Inukjuak, Quebec]] (on the [[Ungava Peninsula]]) were relocated after being promised homes and game to hunt, but the relocated people discovered no buildings and very little familiar wildlife.<ref>[http://www.grisefiord.ca/eng/history.html Grise Fiord: History]</ref>  They were told that they would be returned home after a year if they wished, but this offer was later withdrawn as it would damage Canada's claims to sovereignty in the area and the Inuit were [[forced population transfer|forced to stay]]. Eventually, the Inuit learned the local [[beluga whale]] migration routes and were able to survive in the area, hunting over a range of 18,000&nbsp;square kilometres (6,950&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) each year.<ref>McGrath, Melanie. ''The Long Exile: A Tale of Inuit Betrayal and Survival in the High Arctic''. Alfred A. Knopf, 2006 (268 pages) Hardcover: ISBN 0007157967 Paperback: ISBN 0007157975</ref>

In 1993, the Canadian government held hearings to investigate the relocation program. The [[Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples]] issued a report entitled ''The High Arctic Relocation: A Report on the 1953-55 Relocation'', recommending a settlement.<ref>''The High Arctic Relocation: A Report on the 1953-55 Relocation'' by Ren<U+00E9> Dussault and George Erasmus, produced by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, published by Canadian Government Publishing, 1994 (190 pages)[http://www.fedpubs.com/subject/aborig/arctic_reloc.htm]</ref> The government paid $10 million CAD to the survivors and their families, and gave a formal apology in 2008.<ref>{{cite news

In 2009, [[Looty Pijamini]] was commissioned by the Canadian Government to design a monument in memory of the relocation.<ref>[http://www.nnsl.com/northern-news-services/stories/papers/may11_09cr.html "Carvers chosen for Arctic monuments"], ''Northern News Services''.

===Telephone network===
[[File:Grise Fiord Church.jpg|thumb|Church in Grise Fiord]]
In 1970, [[Bell Canada]] established what was then the world's most northerly [[telephone]] exchange (operated since 1992 by [[Northwestel]]).

===Naming===
Grise Fiord means "pig inlet" in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and was named by [[Otto Sverdrup]] from [[Norway]] during an expedition around 1900. He thought the [[walrus]] in the area sounded like pigs. Grise Fiord's [[Inuktitut]] name is ''Aujuittuq'' which means "place that never thaws."
