'''Women in Chile''' face many economic and political challenges, including [[economic inequality|income disparity]], high rates of [[domestic violence]], and a [[patriarchy|patriarchal culture]] emphasizing traditional [[gender role]]s.<ref name=Menkedick2010>{{cite web|last=Menkedick|first=Sarah|title=Machismo in Chile: Serious Barrier to Gender Equality|url=http://news.change.org/stories/machismo-in-chile-serious-barrier-to-gender-equality|work=Change.org|accessdate=24 February 2012|date=23 May 2010}}</ref>

==Post-Pinochet Chile==
[[Chile]] became a [[democracy]], again, in 1990, leading to changes in women's lives and roles within society. From 2006-2010, [[Michelle Bachelet]] served as the first female [[President of Chile]]. Her administration had an active role in furthering opportunities and policies for and about women, creating or improving on childcare, [[pension]] reform and [[breastfeeding]] laws. The [[Cabinet of Chile]], during Bachelet's presidency, had an equal number of men and women ministers. Unlike neighboring [[Argentina]], where 41.6% of the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]] is made up of women, Chile's lower house only has 15% women representatives.<ref name="StangeOyster2011"/><ref name=Econ1>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Women in Chile: Left behind|url=http://www.economist.com/node/7281220|work=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=24 February 2012|date=10 August 2006}}</ref><ref name=Santiago1>{{cite web|last=Shea|first=Steve|title=Setting quotas in Chile for women in politics|url=http://www.santiagotimes.cl/chile/politics/23074-setting-quotas-in-chile-for-women-in-politics|work=[[Santiago Times]]|accessdate=24 February 2012|date=13 December 2011}}</ref> Argentina has a government mandate requiring that women must make up 30 percent of political party candidates, while Chile has no equivalent law, though certain political parties have their own quotas.<ref name="StangeOyster2011"/> As of 2006, Chile was lower than eight other Latin American countries in regards to women's roles in politics.<ref name=Econ1/>

A 2010 study by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reported that 62 percent of Chileans are opposed to full gender equality. Many of those surveyed expressed the belief that women should limit themselves to the traditional roles of mother and wife.<ref name=Menkedick2010/><ref name=Estrada2010>{{cite news|last=Estrada|first=Daniela|title=Gender Equity Progress Blocked by Hard-Core 'Machismo'|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=51446|accessdate=24 February 2012|date=May 14, 2010|agency=Inter Press Service News Agency}}</ref>

==Education and economic development==

===Education===

Women almost match male [[literacy]] rates, with 95.6 percent of women being able to read, versus 95.8 percent of men. 47.5 percent of of Chilean women attend college.<ref name="StangeOyster2011"/> The enrollment of girls in primary and secondary school has increased as of 2006, and women's education in Chile is generally higher than neighboring countries.<ref name=WB/> In higher education, as of 2002, women had similar attendance rates as men, with women at 47.5 percent attendance, versus men at 52.5 percent.<ref name="Punnett2006B">{{cite book|author=Betty Jane Punnett|title=Successful professional women of the Americas: from polar winds to tropical breezes|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kFJwEOd8Q70C&pg=PA214|accessdate=24 February 2012|year=2006|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84542-437-4|page=212}}</ref>

===Workforce participation===

Chile has the lowest rate of female participation in the work force in all of [[Latin America]].<ref name=Menkedick2010/> Approximately 42 percent of Chilean women work, versus an average of 53 percent across Latin America. Women between the ages of 25 and 34 tend to have jobs, whereas older women do not. Despite the fact that 47.5 percent of students in college are women, many still choose to be [[homemakers]] rather than joining the workforce.<ref name="StangeOyster2011"/> This causes Chile to rank low amongst upper-middle class countries regarding women in the work force despite higher educational training. Internationally, poorer women tend to work more, however, in Chile, poorer women make up a small share of the workforce. 26 percent of poorer women in Chile work, unlike 57 percent of women in higher economic levels.<ref name=WB/> 

In 2009, activists demanded that presidential candidates develop reforms that would improve work conditions for women. Reforms included [[maternity leave]], flexible work schedules and job training.<ref name="StangeOyster2011"/> Aimed at improving women's work opportunities, former president Michelle Bachelet made it illegal to ask for a job applicants gender on applications and for employers to demand [[pregnancy tests]] be taken by employees.<ref name=Econ1/> Despite efforts, it is believed that the practice of forced pregnancy testing is still taking place in some companies, according to reports filed with [[NGO]] La Morada.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Women's low roles in the workforce stem from various factors, including the country's dependance on [[natural resources]], and male dominated industries where women are still slowly finding opportunities for work. In the highly active [[Chilean wine]] industry, one in three [[winemakers]] are women, and in 2010, an estimated one-third of [[enology]] students were women.<ref name=Wine>{{cite web|last=Schachner|first=Michael|title=Chile<U+2019>s Women Winemakers Take Charge|url=http://www.winemag.com/Wine-Enthusiast-Magazine/Web-2010/Women-Winemakers/|work=[[Wine Enthusiast]]|accessdate=24 February 2012|date=10 August 2006}}</ref> A 2004 study shows that 81.4 percent of women work in the [[tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]].<ref name="Punnett2006B"/>

For jobs that do not require higher education, women make 20 percent less money on average than men. For jobs requiring a university degree, the gap in pay increases to 40 percent.<ref name=Menkedick2010/> Women without a university degree make 83 percent of the income men make without a university degree.<ref name="Punnett2006B"/> The quadrennial 2004 National Socio-Economic Survey suggested that the overall gender income gap stood at 33 percent. The minimum wage for [[domestic worker]]s, probably the largest single category of working women, was 75 percent of the standard minimum wage.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

== Legal rights ==

Women enjoy the same legal rights as men, including rights under family law and property law.<ref name=report/>  The [[National Women's Service]] (SERNAM) is charged with protecting women's legal rights in the public sector.<ref name=report/><ref name=WB>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Chile: Reconciling the Gender Paradox|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTENBREVE/Newsletters/21455235/Apr07_105_GenderChile_EN.pdf|work=World Bank|accessdate=24 February 2012|date=April 2007}}</ref>

==Crimes against women==

=== Domestic violence ===

{{Main|Domestic violence in Chile}}
[[Domestic violence]] in Chile is a serious issue affecting a large percentage of the population, especially among lower income demographics. A 2004 [[National Women's Service]] (SERNAM) study reported that 50 percent of married women in Chile had suffered spousal abuse, 34 percent reported having suffered physical violence, and 16 percent reported psychological abuse.<ref name="report">[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78884.htm Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Chile]. [[United States]] [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (March 6, 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''</ref> According to another study from 2004, ninety percent of low income women in Chile experience some type of domestic violence.<ref name="Cianelli2004">{{cite journal|last=Cianelli|first=R.|coauthors=Ferrer, L.; Peragallo, N.|title=Low income Chilean women confronting HIV/AIDS and domestic violence|journal=The XV International AIDS Conference|year=2004|url=http://www.iasociety.org/Default.aspx?pageId=11&abstractId=2169470|accessdate=24 February 2012|location=Bangkok, Thailand}}</ref> Due to the high prevalence of domestic violence, many Chilean women accept it as normal.<ref name="Cianelli2004"/> However, in 2004 [[divorce]] was legalized<ref name="StangeOyster2011"/><ref name=HIV1/>, much to the disapproval of the [[Catholic church]], but to the approval of women throughout the country, especially those concerned about [[domestic violence]], as women were previously unable to escape abusive relationships due to the divorce laws.<ref name="StangeOyster2011"/>

From January to November 2005, 76,000 cases of family violence were reported to the ''[[Carabineros]]''; 67,913 were reported by women, 6,404 by men, and approximately 1,000 by children.<ref name="report"/>

=== Rape ===

Rape, including spousal rape, is a criminal offense. Penalties for rape range from five to 15 years' imprisonment, and the government generally enforced the law. The age for statutory rape is 14. The law protects the privacy and safety of the person making the charge. From January to November, police received reports of 1,926 cases of rape, compared with 2,451 cases in all of 2005. Experts believed that most rape cases went unreported. The Ministry of Justice and the PICH had several offices specifically to provide counseling and assistance in rape cases. A number of NGOs, such as La Morada Corporation for Women, provided counseling for rape victims.<ref name=report/>

=== Sexual harassment ===

Sexual harassment generally was recognized as a problem. A 2005 law against sexual harassment provides protection and financial compensation to victims and penalizes harassment by employers or co-workers. From January through September, the Labor Directorate had received 244 complaints of sexual harassment; 205 of these cases involved harassment by a supervisor or employer. During 2005 there were 264 such complaints--254 made by women and 10 by men; 238 of these cases involved a supervisor or employer. Most of the complaints were resolved quickly, resulting in action against the harasser in 33 percent of cases.<ref name=report/>

=== Discrimination ===

A 2005 study by ''Corporacion Humana'' and the [[University of Chile]]'s Institute of Public Affairs revealed that 87 percent of women surveyed felt that women suffered discrimination. According to the survey, 95 percent believed women faced discrimination in the labor market, 67 percent believed they faced discrimination in politics, 61 percent felt that women were discriminated against by the media, and 54 percent within the family.<ref name=report/>

==Other concerns==

===Family===

Today, younger women are opting out of marriage and having less children than their predecessors.<ref name="StangeOyster2011"/>  A 2002 study reported that urban women average 2.1 children per woman with women living in rural areas having more children, at 2.9. As of the 1990s, both urban and rural women were averaging less children than previously. For those women who do have children, after former president Michelle Bachelet's childcare mandates, childcare centers that provide free services are four times more numerous. Nursing mothers also have the legal right to breastfeed during the workday. In 2004, [[divorce]] was legalized in the country,<ref name="StangeOyster2011"/> but women are less likely to seek divorces and marriage annulments.<ref name="Punnett2006D"/>

===Health & sexuality===

Women in Chile have long [[life expectancy]], living an average of 80.8 years, about 6 years longer than men.<ref name="Punnett2006D">{{cite book|author=Betty Jane Punnett|title=Successful professional women of the Americas: from polar winds to tropical breezes|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kFJwEOd8Q70C&pg=PA214|accessdate=24 February 2012|year=2006|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84542-437-4|page=214}}</ref><ref name="StangeOyster2011">{{cite book|author1=Mary Zeiss Stange|author2=Carol K.

Friends and family usually are the main source of sex education.<ref name=HIV1/> 

====HIV/AIDS====

While cases of [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] in women have stabilized internationally, Chile has seen a rise in HIV/AIDS infection. Social and cultural factors have increased women's chances of getting HIV/AIDS, including the lack of access to reproductive healthcare. Societal beliefs about traditional women's roles as mothers leads to women being less likely to use contraceptives, increasing the opportunity for disease. Chilean women also often feel subordinate to men due to these traditional belief systems, making women less likely to negotiate for the use of [[condoms]]. In 2007, 28 percent of people with HIV/AIDS in Chile were women. Numbers of women living with HIV is lower than those with AIDS. A study by Vivo Positivo showed that 85 percent of women living with HIV/AIDS reported that they had little to no education or information about HIV/AIDS until diagnosis.<ref name=HIV1/>  

A 2004 study found that Chilean women with HIV/AIDS were susceptible  to coerced [[sterilization]]. 56 percent of HIV-positive Chilean women reported being pressured by healthcare workers to prevent pregnancy by being sterilized. Of the women who chose to be sterilized, half were forced or persuaded to do so. Women victims of [[domestic abuse]] face a higher risk of getting HIV. 56 percent of women who have HIV had been victims of domestic abuse before their diagnosis and 77 percent of women with HIV/AIDS, in 2004, reported experiencing some form of violence in the form of domestic abuse, sexual abuse and rape.<ref name=HIV1>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Dignity Denied: Violations of the Rights of HIV-Positive Women in Chilean Health Facilities|url=Dignity Denied: Violations of the Rights of HIV-Positive Women in Chilean Health Facilities|work=[[Center for Reproductive Rights]]|accessdate=24 February 2012|date=}}</ref> 

====Family planning====

Chile has some of the strictest [[abortion]] laws in the world. [[Therapeutic abortion]] is illegal under all circumstances. Estimates range between 120,000 and 160,000 in the numbers of Chilean women who have illegal abortions each year.<ref name="StangeOyster2011"/> Every year, nearly 40,000 teenage girls become pregnant. [[Emergency contraception]] was banned in 2008, making the distribution of EC illegal under all circumstances.<ref name=NYTSlow>{{cite web|last=Barroso|first=Carmen|title=The slow life; The rights of Chile's women|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/01/opinion/01iht-edlet.4.12490848.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=24 February 2012|date=01 May 2008}}</ref> In 2002, over half of Chileans were in favor of legalized abortion, specifically regarding pregnancy from rape and situations when the mother's life is in danger due to pregnancy.<ref name="StangeOyster2011"/> 

Traditional gender role beliefs are prevalent in Chilean society, specifically the ideas of women's role as mothers and as being submissive to men. Submissive roles are believed to make women vulnerable to per-martial and marital [[non-consensual sex]], and makes women less likely to push for the use of condoms. The ''Puertas Adentro'' study, produced by FLACSO-Chile, found that many women believed that condoms made sex less pleasurable for their partners and that condoms can possibly cause men to suffer from [[erectile dysfunction]] (which is untrue). Women also believed that not using condoms was an act of "trust, surrender and love of one's partner," and believed that introducing condoms into a relationship would cause mistrust and suspicion of infidelity.<ref name=HIV1/>
