'''Harvey The Wonder Hamster''' is a song by [["Weird Al" Yankovic]].  It originally appeared on Yankovic's ''[[Al TV]]'' and ''[[Al Music]]'' specials on [[MTV]] and [[MuchMusic]].  It was released on the album ''[[Alapalooza]]'' in 1993.  

Yankovic would introduce his pet [[hamster]], Harvey, sing Harvey's theme song, and after the camera angle changed so a fake non-live hamster could be substitured, Yankovic would dispose of Harvey, often in a violent manner.   Harvey continues to make appearances on ''Al TV'' and ''Al Music'' specials, and appeared on ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' as Yankovic's best friend and stunt-performing hamster.
