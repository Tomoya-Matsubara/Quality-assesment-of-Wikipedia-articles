'''Launceston Airport''' {{airport codes|LST|YMLT}} is a regional airport on the outskirts of [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], [[Tasmania]]. Situated in the rural area of Western Junction, the airport is located {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Launceston City Centre. [[Hobart International Airport]] and Launceston Airport are the only two airports in Tasmania to reach one million passenger movements per year. And like its Hobart counterpart Launceston is a curfew free [[airport]]. In the 2007/2008 Financial Year, Launceston Airport recorded a record 1.1 million passengers. Up 10% on the previous year. During the first three months of 2008, 309,000 passengers passed through Launceston Airport, the most in any previous yearly quarter. Up 11% on the previous year. <ref>[http://www.launcestonairport.com.au/asp/content.asp?articleID=529&id=154 Launceston Airport, Tasmania, Australia - Media Releases<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==History==
[[Image:Virgin Blue Launceston.jpg|thumb|left|[[Virgin Blue]] passengers disembarking at Launceston Airport]]
After the formation of the Tasmanian Aero Club in 1927, the building of the first air travel facility in Tasmania on the site, the ''Western Junction Aerodrome'', began and was first used in 1930, with the [[aerodrome]] being officially opened in 1929.<ref>[http://www.elaunceston.com/launcestonhistory/jun07news.htm Launceston Historical Society Inc]</ref> In 1962 a plan for major redevelopment of the airport was approved. This included strengthening of all pavements, a [[runway]] extension, and soon after a new [[airport terminal|terminal]] building.<ref>[http://www.launcestonairport.com.au/subsector.php?id=107997 A Brief History of Aviation in Tasmania and the Launceston Airport]</ref> The site was officially reopened that same year as ''Launceston Airport''. In October 1982 the runway was further upgraded to [[Boeing 767]] standard. In 1998, the airport was privatized, now being owned by a group known as [[Australia Pacific Airports Corporation Limited]], who is also the owner of [[Melbourne Airport]], in conjunction with [[Launceston City Council]]. The collapse of [[Ansett Australia]] in 2001, the introduction of [[Virgin Blue]] and the [[Qantas]] subsidiary [[Jetstar Airways]] in 2001 & 2004, and the creation of the Australian Low Cost Airline market have all contributed to a dramatic increase in aircraft movements at Launceston Airport. In 2007 Launceston Airport celebrated the milestone of reaching one million passenger movements per year as well as the introduction of [[Tiger Airways Australia]].<ref>[http://www.jetstar.com/pdf/news/20071009.pdf Jetstar congratulates Launceston Airport on one million passenger milestone]</ref>


==Terminal building==
The terminal building services the four interstate airlines: [[QantasLink]], Jetstar, Virgin Blue and Tiger Airways Australia.

Presently the small terminal is inadequate for the amount of passengers that pass through each day. At times where there are 3-4 planes on the tarmac the terminal can become extremely congested. {{Fact|date=September 2008}}

===Terminal Upgrade===
A much needed $20 million dollar upgraded has just been started in June and is expected to be finished in mid 2009. <ref>[http://www.launcestonairport.com.au/asp/content.asp?articleID=529&id=157 Launceston Airport, Tasmania, Australia - Media Releases<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The project will consist of three main parts that will provide Checked Bag Screening and new check in counter areas, new baggage reclaim procedure, with the use of two baggage carousels and new passenger lounges and screening facilities.  This will approximately double the floor area of the terminal allowing for greater space passenger movement and associated activities.  

The first of the three parts of the project, the check bag screening and check in counters will be operational by December 2008, as required by Federal legislation for passenger security.  The other two areas will come on stream in stages over the remaining construction period.

The refurbishment of the departures area will allow a single location for all airlines to provide check in facilities at the 12 new counters.  These counters are linked to a new baggage handling system to a new check bag screening process for all baggage travelling on aircraft.

A revised passenger screening point will increase the level of space provided to passengers during the screening process.

For departing passengers new apron level gate lounges of approximately 1200m2 provide space and security for passengers waiting to board aircrafts.  For arriving passengers, a new baggage handling building of 500m2 incorporating two new baggage carousels will improve baggage reclaim activities for passengers.

For attending public, an expansion of an additional 1000m2 of the main passenger public lounge area and refurbished retail areas, will provide additional space and seating areas with a view of the apron and runway.

==Ground transport==
Launceston Airport has a Short Term and a Long Term Car Park, as well as an Overflow Carpark that can accommodate 150 Cars. 

Airport Shuttle Buses operate mainly from the City Centre to the airport.

==Launceston Airport Business Park==
In a separate development adjacent to the airport site there is a A$200m business park under construction which will include a Caltex service station, an Airport Motor Inn, retail showrooms and also plans for a A$36m Big Box retail development.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}


==Passenger statistics==
Launceston Airport's passenger numbers have increased dramatically in recent years, significantly exceeding the airports forecasts in the ''Airport Master Plan 2005''. The passenger numbers achieved in the 2007-08 [[fiscal year]] were not anticipated until at least fiscal year 2019-20. <ref>http://www.launcestonairport.com.au/bloogoocms/uploads/files/Master%20Plan/2005%20Master%20Plan.pdf</ref>
