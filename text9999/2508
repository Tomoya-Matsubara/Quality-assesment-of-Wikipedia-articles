'''Israel Moiseevich Gelfand''', also written '''Isra<U+00EF>l Moyseyovich Gel'fand''', or '''Izrail M. Gelfand''' ({{lang-yi|<U+05D9><U+05E9><U+05E8><U+05D0><U+05DC> <U+05D2><U+05E2><U+05DC><U+05E4><U+05BF><U+05D0><U+05B7><U+05E0><U+05D3>}}, {{lang-ru|<U+0418><U+0437><U+0440><U+0430><U+0301><U+0438><U+043B><U+044C> <U+041C><U+043E><U+0438><U+0441><U+0435><U+0301><U+0435><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+0413><U+0435><U+043B><U+044C><U+0444><U+0430><U+0301><U+043D><U+0434>}}; {{OldStyleDate|2 September|1913|20 August}} <U+2013> 5 October 2009) was a [[USSR|Soviet]] [[mathematician]] who made major contributions to many branches of mathematics, including [[group theory]], [[representation theory]] and [[functional analysis]].  The recipient of numerous awards and honors, including the [[Order of Lenin]] and the [[Wolf Prize]], he was a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] and a lifelong academic, serving decades as a professor at [[Moscow State University]] and, after immigrating to the United States shortly before his 76th birthday, at the [[Busch Campus (Rutgers University)|Busch Campus]] of [[New Jersey]]'s [[Rutgers University]].

He is known for having educated and inspired generations of students through his legendary seminar at Moscow State University. His legacy continues in the mathematicians who were his students, such as [[Endre Szemer<U+00E9>di]], [[Alexandre Kirillov]], [[Joseph Bernstein]], [[Dmitry Fuchs]] as well as his own son, Sergei Gelfand.

==Early years==
A native of [[Kherson Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]], Gelfand was born into a [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Jewish]] family in the small southern  [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] town of Okny (subsequently, [[Krasni Okny]]).  According to his own account, Gelfand was expelled from high school because his father had been a mill owner. Bypassing both high school and college, he proceeded to postgraduate study at Moscow State University, where his advisor was the preeminent mathematician [[Andrei Kolmogorov]]. He nevertheless managed to attend lectures at the University and began postgraduate study at the age of 19.<ref name="Telegraph">{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/science-obituaries/6440484/Israel-Gelfand.html|title=Science Obituaries: Israel Gelfand|date=26 Oct 2009|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref>

==Work==

Gelfand is known for many developments including:
* the book ''Calculus of Variations'' (1963), which he co-authored with [[Sergei Fomin]]
* the [[Gelfand representation]] in [[Banach algebra]] theory;
* the [[Gelfand<U+2013>Mazur theorem]] in [[Banach algebra]] theory;
* the [[Gelfand<U+2013>Naimark theorem]];
* the [[Gelfand<U+2013>Naimark<U+2013>Segal construction]];
* [[Gelfand<U+2013>Shilov space]]s
* the [[Pettis integral|Gelfand<U+2013>Pettis integral]];
* the [[representation theory]] of the complex classical [[Lie group]]s;
* contributions to the theory of [[Verma module]]s in the [[representation theory]] of [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s (with I.N. Bernstein and S.I. Gelfand);
* contributions to [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] theory and measures on infinite-dimensional spaces;<ref>{{Citation|title=[[Generalized function|Generalized Functions]]|first=I.M.|last=Gel'fand|coauthors=n.Ya.Vilenkin|isbn=0-12-279504-0|publisher=Academic Press|pages=375|year=1964}}</ref>
* the first observation of the connection of [[automorphic form]]s with representations (with [[Sergei Fomin]]);
* conjectures about the [[Atiyah<U+2013>Singer index theorem]];
* [[Ordinary differential equation]]s (Gelfand<U+2013>[[Boris Levitan|Levitan]] theory);
* work on [[calculus of variations]] and [[soliton]] theory (Gelfand<U+2013>Dikii equations);
* contributions to the ''[[philosophy of cusp forms]]'';
* Gelfand<U+2013>Fuks cohomology of [[foliation]]s;
* Gelfand<U+2013>Kirillov dimension;
* [[integral geometry]];
* combinatorial definition of the [[Pontryagin class]];
* [[Coxeter functor]]s;
* [[general hypergeometric function]]s;
* Gelfand - Tsetlin patterns;
* and many other results, particularly in the representation theory for the classical groups.

==Influence outside of mathematics==
The ''Gelfand<U+2013>Tsetlin basis'' (also in the common spelling ''Zetlin'') is a widely used tool in [[theoretical physics]] and the result of Gelfand's work on the representation theory of the unitary group and Lie groups in general.

Gelfand also published works on biology and medicine.<ref>[[:ru:<U+0413><U+0435><U+043B><U+044C><U+0444><U+0430><U+043D><U+0434>, <U+0418><U+0437><U+0440><U+0430><U+0438><U+043B><U+044C> <U+041C><U+043E><U+0438><U+0441><U+0435><U+0435><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447>]]</ref> For a long time he took an interest in [[cell biology]] and organized a research seminar on the subject.<ref>V.I. Agol, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/p7138232265768r3/ Notes about I.M. Gelfand<U+2019>s Seminar], ''Russian Journal Developmental Biology, Volume 39, Number 6, 367-368.</ref><ref>L.V.

He worked extensively in mathematics education, particularly with correspondence education. In 1994, he was awarded a [[MacArthur fellowship]] for this work.

==Family==
Gelfand was married to Zorya Shapiro, and their two sons, Sergei and Vladimir both live in the United States.  A third son, Aleksandr, died of [[leukemia]].  Following the divorce from his first wife, Gelfand married his second wife, Tatiana.  Gelfand and Tatiana became the parents of a daughter, Tatiana. The family also includes four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/08/science/08gelfand.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=Israel%20Gelfand&st=cse Chang, Kenneth.

The memories about I.Gelfand are collected at the special site<ref>http://israelmgelfand.com/ site dedicated to Israel M. Gelfand</ref> handled by his family.

==Honors and awards==
Gelfand held several honorary degrees and was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]] three times for his research.  In 1977 he was elected a [[Foreign Member of the Royal Society]]. He won the [[Wolf Prize]] in 1978, [[Kyoto Prize]] in 1989 and MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1994. He held the presidency of the [[Moscow Mathematical Society]] between 1968 and 1970, and was elected a foreign member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|U.S. National Academy of Science]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[Royal Irish Academy]], the [[American Mathematical Society]] and the [[London Mathematical Society]].

In an October 2003 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', written on the occasion of his 90th birthday, Gelfand is described as a scholar who is considered "among the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century",<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/05/nyregion/in-person-an-equation-for-success.html Kochman, Marilyn. "In Person: An Equation for Success", ''The New York Times'' (October 5, 2003)]</ref> having exerted a tremendous influence on the field both through his own works and those of his students.

==Death==
Israel Gelfand died at the [[Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital]] near his home in [[Highland Park, New Jersey]].  He was less than five weeks past his 96th birthday.  His death was first reported on the blog of his former collaborator Andrei Zelevinsky<ref>{{ru icon}} [http://avzel.blogspot.com/2009/10/blog-post_05.html "<U+0421><U+043A><U+043E><U+043D><U+0447><U+0430><U+043B><U+0441><U+044F> <U+0418>.<U+041C>. <U+0413><U+0435><U+043B><U+044C><U+0444><U+0430><U+043D><U+0434>"] ("I.M.
