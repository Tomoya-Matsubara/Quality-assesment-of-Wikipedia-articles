The '''Chicago metropolitan area''', or '''Chicagoland''' as it is commonly called within the area,{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} is the [[metropolitan area]] associated with the city of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and its suburbs. It is the area that is closely linked to the city through social, economic, and cultural ties. 

There are several definitions of the area, including the area defined by the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) as the [[Chicago]]-[[Joliet]]-[[Naperville]], IL-IN-WI [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA), and the area under the jurisdiction of the [[Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning]] (a [[metropolitan planning organization]]). The population of the Chicago CSA ([[Combined Statistical Area]]) is over 9.8 million people.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Definitions==
===Metropolitan statistical area===
The Chicago [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA) was originally designated by the [[United States Census Bureau]] in 1950. It consisted of the [[Illinois]] counties of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake and Will, along with Lake County in [[Indiana]]. As surrounding counties saw an increase in their population densities and the number of their residents employed within Cook County, they met Census criteria to be added to the MSA. The Chicago MSA, now defined as the ''Chicago-Naperville-Joliet, IL-IN-WI MSA'', is the third largest MSA by population in the United States with a population of 10,055,638 (2009 estimate).<ref name=csa_pop>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/metro/files/2009/CSA-EST2009-alldata.csv|title=CSA-EST2009-alldata|date=July 1, 2009|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=February 15, 2011|format=csv|quote=The MSA covers 7,214 sq. mi. of land area and 2,367 sq. mi. of water area. The total area of the MSA is 9,581 sq. mi.}}</ref> The Chicago metro area is the largest in an emerging [[Great Lakes Megalopolis]].

The Chicago MSA is further subdivided into the ''Chicago-Naperville-Joliet, IL Metropolitan Division'', corresponding roughly to the CMAP region; the ''Gary, IN Metropolitan Division'' consisting of the Indiana counties of Lake and Porter, as well as two surrounding counties; and the ''Lake County-Kenosha County, IL-WI Metropolitan Division''.

The 2009 estimated populations of the three Metropolitan Divisions are as follows:<ref name=csa_pop/>

===Combined statistical area===
The OMB also defines a slightly larger region as a [[Combined Statistical Area]] (CSA). The ''Chicago-Naperville-Michigan City, IL-IN-WI CSA'' combines the metropolitan areas of Chicago, [[Michigan City, Indiana|Michigan City]] (in [[Indiana]]), and [[Kankakee, Illinois|Kankakee]] (in [[Illinois]]). This area represents the extent of the labor market pool for the entire region. The CSA has a population of 9,804,845 (2009 estimate).<ref name=csa_pop/>

===Chicagoland===
[[File:Chicagoland Counties.JPG|thumb|350px|Chicagoland (as defined by Construction Data Company) by county and state.]]
[[File:Chicagoland Map.svg|thumb|200px|A map of Chicagoland in relation to the states of Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana.]]
Chicagoland is an informal name for the Chicago metropolitan area. There is no official definition for Chicagoland, which may be larger than the MSA and include portions of the greater CSA.

However, there are differing viewpoints, which are usually the point of view of whomever one speaks with.

==Geography of Chicago==
{{Main|Geography of Chicago}}

The city of Chicago lies in the Chicago Plain, a flat and broad area characterized by little topographical relief. The few low hills here and there are sand ridges. North of the Chicago Plain, steep bluffs and ravines run alongside Lake Michigan. 

Along the southern shore of the Chicago Plain, sand dunes run alongside the lake. The tallest dunes reach up to near {{convert|200|ft|m}} and are found in the [[Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore]]. Surrounding the low plain are bands of [[moraine]]s in the south and west suburbs. These areas are higher and hillier than the Chicago Plain. A [[continental divide]], separating the [[Mississippi River]] watershed from that of the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Saint Lawrence River]], runs through the Chicago area.

==Demographics==
[[Image:Chicagoland air.jpg|thumb|250px|Airborne view of the dense southern part of Chicago, running alongside Lake Michigan. Downtown Chicago is at the far left by the lake in the photo.]]

The suburbs, surrounded by easily annexed flat ground, have been expanding at a tremendous rate since the early 1960s. Aurora, Elgin, Joliet, and Naperville are noteworthy for being four of the few [[boomburb]]s outside the [[Sun Belt]], [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and [[Mountain States]] regions, and [[Commuter town|exurban]] [[Kendall County, Illinois|Kendall County]] ranked as the fastest-growing county (among counties with a population greater than 10,000) in the United States between the years 2000 and 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=157223 |title=Kendall County is fastest growing in the nation |publisher=Daily Herald |date= |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}</ref>

Settlement patterns in the Chicago metropolitan area tend to follow those in the city proper: the northern suburbs along the shore of [[Lake Michigan]] are comparatively affluent, while the southern suburbs (sometimes known as [[Chicago Southland]]) are less so, with lower median incomes and a lower cost of living. However, there is a major exception to this. While Chicago's West Side is the poorest section of the city, the western and northwestern suburbs contain many affluent areas. According to the 2000 Census, [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]] had the highest median household income of any county in the [[Midwestern United States]].

According to the 2000 U.S. Census, poverty rates of the largest counties from least poverty to most are as follows: McHenry 3.70%, Dupage 5.9%, Will 6.7%, Lake 6.9%, Kane 7.4%, Cook 14.5%.

In an in-depth historical analysis, Keating (2004, 2005) examined the origins of 233 settlements that by 1900 had become suburbs or city neighborhoods of the Chicago metropolitan area. The settlements began as farm centers (41%), industrial towns (30%), residential railroad suburbs (15%), and recreational/institutional centers (13%). Although relations between the different settlement types were at times contentious, there also was cooperation in such undertakings as the construction of high schools.

==Population==
As the Chicago metropolitan area has grown, more counties have been partly or totally assimilated with the taking of each decennial census.

[[Image:Vecerne Chicago.jpg|thumb|250px|Westward view from the [[Willis Tower]] in [[Chicago]].]]

The [[Chicago]] metropolitan area is home to the corporate headquarters of 57 [[Fortune 1000]] companies, which includes [[Boeing]], [[McDonald's]], [[Motorola]], [[Discover Financial]] Services, [[United Continental Holdings]], [[Walgreens]], and [[Aon plc|Aon]] among others, representing a diverse group of industries.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2008/states/IL.html | work=CNN | title=Fortune 500 2008: States - Illinois}}</ref> The area is a major global financial center, and Chicago is home to the largest [[futures exchange]] in the world, the [[CME Group]] (Chicago Mercantile Exchange). In March 2008, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced its acquisition of NYMEX Holdings Inc, the parent company of the New York Mercantile Exchange and Commodity Exchange. CME'S acquisition of NYMEX was completed in August 2008.

A key piece of infrastructure for several generations was the [[Union Stock Yards]] of Chicago, which from 1865 until 1971 penned and slaughtered millions of cattle and hogs into standardized cuts of [[beef]] and [[pork]].

The Chicago area, meanwhile, began to produce significant quantities of telecommunications gear, electronics, steel, crude oil derivatives, automobiles, and industrial capital goods.

By the early 2000s, Illinois' economy had moved toward a dependence on high-value-added services, such as financial trading, [[higher education]], [[logistics]], and health care.  In some cases, these services clustered around institutions that hearkened back to Illinois's earlier economies.  For example, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a trading exchange for global [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]], had begun its life as an agricultural [[futures exchange|futures market]].

In 2007, the area ranked first among U.S. metro areas in the number of new and expanded corporate facilities.<ref>{{cite web|author=RON STARNER|url=http://www.siteselection.com/issues/2008/mar/topMetros/ |title=TOP METROS OF 2007 - Site Selection magazine, March 2008 |publisher=Siteselection.com |date= |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}</ref> It ranked third in 2008, behind the [[Greater Houston|Houston<U+2013>Sugar Land<U+2013>Baytown]] and [[Dallas<U+2013>Fort Worth metropolitan area]]s,<ref>{{cite web|author=RON STARNER|url=http://www.siteselection.com/issues/2009/mar/top-metros/ |title=TOP METROS OF 2008 - Site Selection magazine, March 2009 |publisher=Siteselection.com |date=March 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}</ref> and ranked second behind the [[New York metropolitan area]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siteselection.com/issues/2010/mar/Top-Metros/ |title=TOP METROS OF 2009 - Site Selection Magazine, March 2010 |publisher=Siteselection.com |date= |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}</ref>

==Area codes==
{{Main|List of Illinois area codes}}

From 1947 until 1988, the Illinois portion of the Chicago metro area was served by a single [[North American Numbering Plan|area code]], 312, which abutted the 815 area code.  In 1988 the 708 area code was introduced and the 312 area code became exclusive to the city of Chicago.

It became common to call suburbanites "708'ers", in reference to their area code.

The 708 area code was partitioned in 1996 into three area codes, serving different portions of the metro area: 630, 708, and 847.

At the same time that the 708 area code was running out of phone numbers, the 312 area code in Chicago was also exhausting its supply of available numbers. As a result, the city of Chicago was divided into two area codes, 312 and 773.  Rather than divide the city by a north/south area code, the central business district retained the 312 area code, while the remainder of the city took the new 773 code.

In 2002, the 847 area code was supplemented with the overlay area code 224.  In February 2007, the 815 area code (serving outlying portions of the metro area) was supplemented with the overlay area code 779.  In October 2007, the overlay area code 331 was implemented to supplement the 630 area with additional numbers.

Plans are in place for overlay codes in the 708, 773, and 312 regions as those area codes become exhausted in the future.
*[[Area code 312|312]] Chicago - City (The [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] and central neighborhoods, e.g. the Near North Side)
*[[Area code 773|773]] Chicago - City (Everywhere else within the city limits, excluding central area)
*[[Area code 872|872]] Chicago - City (overlay for 312 & 773, effective November 7, 2009)
*[[Area codes 847 and 224|847/224]] (North and Northwest Suburbs)
*[[Area codes 630 and 331|630/331]] (Outer Western Suburbs)
*[[Area code 708|708]] (South and Near West Suburbs)
*[[Area codes 815 and 779|815/779]] ([[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]] & [[Joliet, Illinois|Joliet]]: Far Northwest/Southwest Suburbs)
*[[Area code 219|219]] (Northwest Indiana)
*[[Area code 574|574]] (North-central Indiana)
*[[Area code 262|262]] (Southeast Wisconsin surrounding [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]])
