The '''Oklahoma State University Cowgirls basketball team plane crash''' occurred on November 17, 2011, and killed four including head coach [[Kurt Budke]] and Assistant Coach Miranda Serna, of the [[Oklahoma State Cowgirls basketball|OSU Women's Basketball]] team, as well as former [[Oklahoma State Senate|State Senator]] [[Olin Branstetter]] and his wife.

== Incident ==
The plane involved was a [[Piper PA-28 Cherokee|Piper PA-28-180]] built in 1964. No flight data or voice recorders were installed aboard the aircraft. The pilot and registered owner, former [[Oklahoma State Senate|Oklahoma State Senator]] [[Olin Branstetter]] was a certified commercial pilot and was flight-instrument rated.<ref name="ESPN, NTSB">{{cite news|author1=Associated Press|title=No mechanical failure in OSU crash|url=http://espn.go.com/womens-college-basketball/story/_/id/8998198/ntsb-finds-no-evidence-mechanical-failure-oklahoma-state-cowgirls-plane-crash|accessdate=19 July 2014|agency=Associated Press|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=28 February 2013}}</ref><ref name="ESPN, first">{{cite news|author1=Associated Press|title=Kurt Budke, Miranda Serna die in crash|url=http://espn.go.com/womens-college-basketball/story/_/id/7250025/oklahoma-state-cowboys-coach-kurt-budke-assistant-miranda-serna-killed-plane-crash|accessdate=19 July 2014|agency=Associated Press|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=11 November 2011}}</ref>

The aircraft was piloted by Branstetter on a donor flight on November 17, 2011 with passengers: head coach [[Kurt Budke]] and assistant coach Miranda Serna, of the [[Oklahoma State Cowgirls basketball|OSU Women's Basketball]] team and Branstetter's wife Paula. The flight originated in Stillwater, Oklahoma, where the team had just won their first game of the season versus Rice and was to arrive in North Little Rock, Arkansas, as part of a trip to scout prospective high school players.<ref name="ESPN, first" /><ref name="ESPN, NTSB" />

The aircraft was flying at 7,000 feet over Arkansas when it turned right and started to descend. The pilot did not raise any alert prior to crashing nose-first into a ridge near Perryville at 4:10 p.m. Hunters near the scene called emergency services when they noticed the aircraft in distress.<ref name="ESPN, first" /><ref name="ESPN, NTSB" />

== After-incident report ==

The NTSB's investigation released in February 2013 concluded that Branstetter lost control of the aircraft, although the reason for the loss of control could not be determined. The report ruled out weather as a factor and said that there was no evidence to support that an existing medical condition in the pilot had been a cause. The NTSB found no issues with the aircraft's instruments, engine and airframe.<ref name="ESPN, first" />

== Impact ==
The crash came the day before the 2011 [[Oklahoma State Cowboys]] football team lost its only game of the season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/big12/story/2011-11-19/iowa-state-upsets-oklahoma-state/51303048/1|title=Iowa State stuns No. 2 Oklahoma State in 2OT|publisher=USA Today|date=19 November 2011|accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref> Students, players and staff wore ribbons with the number 4, and the coaches' initials in remembrance. Additionally, a memorial was set up inside [[Gallagher-Iba Arena]] bearing semblance to these ribbons in honor of Coach Budke and Coach Serna.<ref>http://www.okstate.com/ot/the-four.html</ref> Assistant coach Jim Littell was named interim head coach and team's following two games were canceled. Since the accident, the university expanded its rules prohibiting single-engine aircraft travel to include coaches, staff and pilots, while rules were put in place to ensure all flight aircraft would be reviewed by a consultant.<ref name="ESPN, first" /><ref name="ESPN, NTSB" />

The family of Budke received [[workers<U+2019> compensation]] from the university, while the families of both coaches reached a settlement with the estate of the pilot and his wife in July 2014.<ref name=Settlement>{{cite news|last1=Ellis|first1=Randy|title=Settlement reached in lawsuit over plane crash that killed Oklahoma State University coaches|url=http://newsok.com/settlement-reached-in-lawsuit-over-plane-crash-that-killed-oklahoma-state-university-coaches/article/5004587|accessdate=20 July 2014|work=The Oklahoman|publisher=NewsOK.com|date=15 July 2014}}</ref>
