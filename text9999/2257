The [[Australia national cricket team|Australian cricket team]] toured the West Indies in the 1977-78 season to play a five-match [[Test cricket|Test]] series against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]]. The tour also encompassed a pair of One Day Internationals, plus six tour matches against the [[Cricket in the West Indies|West Indies']] [[first class cricket|first class]] sides.

The West Indies won the test series 3-1 with one match drawn. The West Indies therefore regained the Sir [[Frank Worrell Trophy]] which had been lost [[West Indian cricket team in Australia in 1968<U+2013>69|in 1968]]. They would hold this trophy against Australia until [[Australian cricket team in West Indies in 1994<U+2013>95#Australia 1994-95|1995]].

==Australian squad==
Australia had just [[Indian cricket team in Australia in 1977<U+2013>78|defeated India]] 3-2 at home during the 1977-78 season; however, the team was rebuilding in the wake of defections of players to [[World Series Cricket]]. Most of these players were available for selection but the furore had led the [[Australian Cricket Board]] refusing to consider those players that had signed up to play in WSC for selection to the national side.

The original squad selected were as follows:
*Batsmen - [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]] (captain), [[Graham Yallop]], [[Peter Toohey]], [[Rick Darling]], [[Graeme Wood]], [[Craig Serjeant]], [[Kim Hughes]], [[Gary Cosier]]
*Fastbowlers - [[Jeff Thomson]] (vice captain), [[Wayne Clark (cricketer)|Wayne Clark]], [[Ian Callen]] 
*Spinners - [[Bruce Yardley]], [[Jim Higgs]]
*All rounder - [[Trevor Laughlin]]
*Wicketkeeper - [[Steve Rixon]]

===Replacements===
Kim Hughes fell ill during the tour and [[David Ogilvie (cricketer)|David Ogilvie]] was flown out as a replacement.

==Test series==
The furore over [[World Series Cricket]] had led the [[Australian Cricket Board|ACB]] to refuse to consider for selection to the national team any Australian player that had signed up to WSC. The [[West Indies Cricket Board]] took a different view, and chose a number of their players from those signed to the [[Kerry Packer]] organisation for the first two games. This led to the West Indies easily beating the tourists to take a 2-0 lead in the series. However, in the lead up to the 3rd Test in [[Guyana]], the WICB made a decision to leave out three of their WSC contracted players, ostensibly to allow others a chance to play in test matches prior to the West Indies' tour to [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] later in the year, which would be at a time that World Series Cricket could not guarantee the availability of their West Indian players. The non-selection of these three players led to the resignation of [[Clive Lloyd]] as captain, and all of the WSC contracted West Indian players to declare themselves unavailable for the rest of the series.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152167.html West Indies v Australia] - Wisden</ref> Australia won the 3rd test, but lost the 4th.
