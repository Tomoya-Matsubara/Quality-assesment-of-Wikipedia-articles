'''Chr<U+00E9>tien de Troyes''' ({{IPA-fr|k<U+0281>e.tj<U+025B><U+0303> d<U+0259>.t<U+0281>wa}}) (''[[wikt:Christian#Old French|Christian]]'') was a late [[12th century in poetry|12th century]] [[France|French]] poet and [[trouv<U+00E8>re]] known for his work on [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] subjects, and for originating the character [[Lancelot]]. This work represents some of the best-regarded of [[medieval literature]]. His use of structure, particularly in ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]'', has been seen as a step towards the modern [[novel]]. Chr<U+00E9>tien may have become known as Christian of Troyes in contrast to the Jewish [[Rashi]], also of Troyes{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}.  Little is known of his life, but he seems to have been from [[Troyes]], or at least intimately connected with it, and between 1160 and 1172 he served at the court of his patroness [[Marie of France, Countess of Champagne]], daughter of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], perhaps as [[herald-at-arms]] (as [[Gaston Paris]] speculated).<ref>From [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext97/dtroy10.txt "Four Arthurian Romances"] gutenberg.org. Retrieved March 29, 2007.</ref>  One source of information on Chr<U+00E9>tien de Troyes' novels is the book by M. Altieri entitled,  Les Romans de Chr<U+00E9>tien de Troyes:  Leur perspective proverbiale et gnomique (1976, A G Nizet, Paris).

==Works==
Chr<U+00E9>tien's works include seven major poems in rhyming eight-syllable couplets. Four of these are complete; ''[[Erec and Enide]]'' (c. 1170); ''[[Clig<U+00E8>s]]'' (c. 1176), and ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]'' and ''[[Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart]]'', both written simultaneously between 1177 and 1181. Chr<U+00E9>tien's final romance was ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]'', written between 1181 and 1190, but left unfinished, though some scholars have disputed this. It is dedicated to [[Philip, Count of Flanders]], to whom Chr<U+00E9>tien may have been attached in his last years.  He finished only 9,000 lines of the work, but four successors of varying talents added 54,000 additional lines in what are known as the [[Perceval, the Story of the Grail#The Continuations|Four Continuations]]. Similarly, the last thousand lines of ''Lancelot'' were written by [[Godefroi de Leigni]], apparently by arrangement with Chr<U+00E9>tien. In the case of ''Perceval'', one continuer says the poet's death prevented him from completing the work, in the case of ''Lancelot'', no reason is given. This has not stopped speculation that Chr<U+00E9>tien did not approve of ''Lancelot'''s adulterous subject.

To him are also attributed two lesser works: the pious romance ''Guillaume d'Angleterre'' (an attribution that is now widely doubted), and ''[[Philomela|Philomena]]'', the only one of his four poems based on [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' that has survived.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Frappier |first1=Jean |year=1974 |origyear=1959 |chapter=Chr<U+00E9>tien de Troyes |editor1-last=Loomis |editor1-first=Roger Sherman |editor1-link=Roger Sherman Loomis |title=Arthurian Literature in the Middle Ages: A Collaborative History |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |page=159 |isbn=0198115881 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Owen |first1=D. D. R. (trans.) |year=1987 |title=Chr<U+00E9>tien de Troyes Arthurian Romances |location=London |publisher=Dent |page=x |isbn=0460116983 }}</ref> Chr<U+00E9>tien names his treatments of Ovid in the introduction to ''Clig<U+00E8>s'', where he also mentions his work about [[King Mark]] and [[Iseult]]. The latter is presumably related to the [[Tristan and Iseult]] legend, though it is interesting that [[Tristan]] is not named.  Chr<U+00E9>tien's Tristan has not survived, though in the introduction of Clig<U+00E8>s, Chr<U+00E9>tien himself says that his treatment of Tristan was not well received, possibly explaining why it does not survive.

Chr<U+00E9>tien's works are written in vernacular [[Old French]], although it is marked by traits of the regional [[Champenois language|Champenois dialect]] (which is still fairly similar to the "standard" French of Paris).

==Sources==
The immediate and specific source for his romances is of deep interest to the student; unfortunately, he has left us in the dark as to what these were. He speaks in the vaguest way of the materials he used, and though [[Celt]]ic influence is easily detectable in the stories, there is no direct evidence that he had [[Celt]]ic written sources. [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] or [[Wace]] might have supplied some of the names, but neither author mentioned [[Erec]], [[Lancelot]], [[Gornemant]] and many others who play an important role in Chr<U+00E9>tien's narratives. One is forced to guess about Latin or French literary originals which are now lost, or upon continental lore that goes back to a Celtic source. It is the same problem that faces the student in the case of [[B<U+00E9>roul]], an [[Anglo-Norman]] who wrote around 1150. However, Chr<U+00E9>tien found his sources immediately at hand, without much understanding of its primitive spirit, but appreciating it as a setting for the ideal society dreamed of, although not realized, in his own day. And Chr<U+00E9>tien's five romances together form the most complete expression from a single author of the ideals of French [[chivalry]].
Though so far there has been little critical attention paid to the subject, it is not inaccurate to say that Chr<U+00E9>tien was influenced by the changing face of secular and canonical law in the twelfth century. This is particularly relevant for his ''[[Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart]]'' which makes repeated use of the customary law prevalent in Chr<U+00E9>tien<U+2019>s day.

==Influence==
Chr<U+00E9>tien's writing was very popular, as evidenced by the high number of surviving copies of his romances and their many adaptations into other languages. Three of [[Middle High German]] literature's finest examples, [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s ''[[Parzival]]'' and [[Hartmann von Aue]]'s ''[[Erec (poem)|Erec]]'' and ''[[Iwein (poem)|Iwein]]'', were based on ''Perceval'', ''Erec'', and ''Yvain''; the Three [[Welsh Romances]] associated with the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', ''[[Peredur, son of Efrawg]]'', ''[[Geraint and Enid]]'', and ''[[Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain]]'' are derived from the same trio. Especially in the case of ''Peredur'', however, the connection between the Welsh romances and their source is probably not direct, and has never been satisfactorily delineated. Chr<U+00E9>tien also has the distinction of being the first writer to mention the [[Holy Grail]] (''Perceval'') and the love affair between Queen [[Guinevere]] and [[Lancelot]] (''Lancelot''), subjects of household recognition even today.

There is a specific Latin influence in Chr<U+00E9>tien<U+2019>s romances the likes of which (The ''[[Iliad]]'', The ''[[Aeneid]]'', ''[[Metamorphoses]]'') were <U+201C>translated into the Old French vernacular during the 1150s<U+201D>.<ref name="Uitti">Uitti, ''Chr<U+00E9>tien de Troyes Revisited''</ref> Foster Guyer argues that specifically ''Yvain, the Knight of the Lion'' contains definite [[Ovid]]ian influence:
:Yvain was filled with grief and showed the Ovidian love symptoms of weeping and sighing so bitterly that he could scarcely speak. He declared that he would never stay away a full year.  Using words like those of Leander in the seventeenth of Ovid<U+2019>s Epistles he said: 'If only I had the wings of a dove/to fly back to you at will/Many and many a time I would come'.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Guyer |first1=Foster Erwin |year=1960 |title=Chr<U+00E9>tien de Troyes: Inventor of the Modern Novel |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VZfwAAAAMAAJ&q=%22showed+the+Ovidian%22&dq=%22showed+the+Ovidian%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3QiLU8SACeqL0AXhi4D4DQ&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA |location=London |publisher=Vision Press |page=101 |accessdate=1 June 2014 }}</ref>

===Anticipating the modern novel===
Chr<U+00E9>tien has been termed <U+201C>the inventor of the modern novel<U+201D> and Karl Uitti argues:
:With [Chr<U+00E9>tien<U+2019>s work] a new era opens in the history of European story telling<U+2026>this poem reinvents the genre we call narrative romance; in some important respects it also initiates the vernacular novel.<ref name="Uitti"/>

The main quality of the above-mentioned Celtic influences was that of a sort of incompleteness. A <U+201C>story<U+201D> could be anything from a single battle scene, to a prologue, to a minimally cohesive tale with little to no chronological layout. Uitti argues that ''Yvain'' is Chr<U+00E9>tien<U+2019>s <U+201C>most carefully contrived romance<U+2026> It has a beginning, a middle, and an end: we are in no doubt that Yvain<U+2019>s story is over<U+201D>.<ref name="Uitti"/> This very method of having a three definite parts including the build in the middle leading to the climax of the story is in large part why Chr<U+00E9>tien is seen to be a writer of novels five centuries before novels, as we know them, existed.
