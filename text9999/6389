'''Ray Clark Washburn''' (born [[May 31]], [[1938]] in [[Pasco, Washington]]) is a former [[Major League Baseball]] [[pitcher]]. Washburn, a right-hander, pitched for the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] from {{by|1961}} to {{by|1969}} and the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in {{by|1970}}.

A graduate of [[Whitworth College]], Washburn, a $50,000 "[[bonus baby]],"  went 12-9 with the Cardinals as a rookie in {{by|1962}}. A shoulder muscle tear midway into the {{by|1963}} season sidelined him for the remainder of the year and limited his effectiveness for the next two years afterwards. Washburn regained this effectiveness in {{by|1966}}, winning 11 games against 9 losses; in {{by|1967}}, he won 10 games against 7 losses on a Cardinal team that won the [[1967 World Series|World Series]], defeating the [[Boston Red Sox]] in seven games. He had missed nearly a month of action that season after his thumb was broken by a [[Johnny Roseboro]] line drive on June 21.

{{by|1968}} was Washburn<U+2019>s best season; he posted a 14-8 record with a 2.26 [[earned run average]] on a Cardinals team that repeated as [[National League]] champions. The wins and ERA were a career best, as was his [[strikeout]] total (124). Washburn also [[no-hitter|no-hit]] the [[San Francisco Giants]] 2-0 at [[Monster Park|Candlestick Park]] on [[September 18]] of that year; the no-hitter was the first by a Cardinal since [[Lon Warneke]] in {{by|1941}} and came one day after the Giants<U+2019> [[Gaylord Perry]] had pitched a no-hitter of his own, defeating the Cardinals and [[Bob Gibson]]<U+2014>the first time in Major League history that back-to-back no-hitters had been pitched in the same series. In Game Three of the [[1968 World Series|World Series]] against the [[Detroit Tigers]], Washburn allowed home runs to [[Al Kaline]] and [[Dick McAuliffe]] but only two hits otherwise, and defeated the Tigers 7-3. However, he was shelled in Game Six, giving up five runs in two innings, the last three coming in a record-tying 10-run third inning for the Tigers, who won the game 13-1. St. Louis then lost Game Seven the very next day, and the Series with it<U+2014>after leading three games to one.

Washburn slumped to 3-8 as a spot starter during the {{by|1969}} season, after which the Cardinals traded him to the Cincinnati Reds for another 1968 no-hit pitcher, [[George Culver]]. Washburn pitched mostly in [[relief pitcher|relief]] on a Reds team that won the {{by|1970}} National League pennant, its first in nine years. His final Major League appearance was in the final game of [[1970 World Series|that year's World Series]], in which the [[Baltimore Orioles]] defeated the Reds in five games.

In his career, Washburn won 72 games and lost 64 with a 3.53 earned run average and struck out 700 batters in 1209 2/3 [[innings pitched]].

On May 12, {{by|1966}}, Washburn threw the first pitch in the history of [[Busch Stadium II]]; the Cardinals defeated the [[Atlanta Braves]] in 12 innings. He also pitched, as a Red, in the first ever game at [[Riverfront Stadium]] on June 30, {{by|1970}}, also against the Braves.
