'''''Mickey's Trailer''''' is a ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'' animated [[short film]], produced by [[Walt Disney Productions]] and released on [[May 6]], [[1938]] by [[RKO Radio Pictures]]. It stars Mickey Mouse, [[Donald Duck]] and [[Goofy]] on a trailer vacation. 

==Story==

We start at what seems like a small house. Mickey walks out the door and says, "Oh boy! What a day!". Then, he pulls a lever and walks inside. The house is converted into a trailer and Goofy's car is released from the side. Then, Goofy starts driving through the countryside while Mickey makes breakfast (corn on the cob, baked potatoes, watermelon, coffee, and milk). Meanwhile, Donald can't wake up. Thanks to a secret controlboard, Mickey manages to wake him up and gives Donald a bath. Later, the bath area is converted into the kitchen. After Mickey rings the dinner bell, Goofy foolishly leaves the driver's seat for breakfast. After several mishaps at breakfast and almost causing the trailer to fall off the road, Goofy accidentally unhitches the trailer in panic and goes on his way. The trailer crashes in several places and is a wreck by the time it's rehitched. Goofy says in the end, "Well, I brought you down safe and sound."

==Voice Cast==

*[[Mickey Mouse]] - [[Walt Disney]]

==Trivia==
*[[Pete (Disney character)|Pete]] makes a cameo in this cartoon where he is seen driving a truck during the "Runaway Trailer" sequence featuring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.

==Censorship==
*Sometimes, this cartoon cuts out the part where Goofy struggles with the corncob, during the part in which he sticks his fork in a light socket and then, the resulting electric shock pops the corn.

==Other References== 

This cartoon was later adapted into a [[comic strip]] story titled ''The Unhappy Campers'' in which they replaced Donald with [[Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse]] and [[Pluto]]. This was because Donald was not a character in the ''Mickey Mouse'' Comic Strip at the time.

The film is also part of the Christmas show ''[[From All of Us to All of You]]''.

The film was also incorporated into the [[1983]] film ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]].''
