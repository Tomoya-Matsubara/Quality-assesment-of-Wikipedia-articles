==History==
The descriptive [[Inuit]] name of the place, "Tikarakh" or "[[Tikigaq]]" commonly spelled "Tiagara," means "forefinger". It was recorded as "Tiekagagmiut" in 1861 by P. Tikhmeniev Wich of the [[Imperial Russian Navy|Russian Hydrographic Department]] and on Russian Chart 1495 it became "Tiekaga". This ancient village site was advantageous, because the protrusion of Point Hope into the sea brought the whales close to the shore.

The first recorded Europeans to sight this cape were [[Russians|Russian]] explorers [[Ensign Mikhail Vasiliev|Mikhail Vasiliev]] and [[Gleb Shishmaryov]] of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] on ships ''Otkrietie'' and ''Blagonamierennie''. Vasiliev and Shishmaryov named this landhead '''Mys Golovnina''', after Vice Admiral [[Vasily Golovnin]] (1776-1831).

The cape at Point Hope was renamed by Captain [[Frederick William Beechey]] of the [[Royal Navy]], who wrote in August 2, 1826: ''"I named it Point Hope in compliment to Sir [[William Johnstone Hope]]".'' According to Archdeacon Stuck (1920, p. 96) Hope was from a "well-known house long connected with the sea".<ref>[http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=108:3:7904351601948579158::NO::P3_FID:1408109 USGS]</ref>
