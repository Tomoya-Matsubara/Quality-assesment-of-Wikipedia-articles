The '''Russian ironclad ''Sevastopol''''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0421><U+0435><U+0432><U+0430><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+043F><U+043E><U+043B><U+044C>}}) was ordered as a 58-gun wooden [[frigate]] by the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] in the early 1860s, but was converted while under construction into a 32-gun [[armored frigate]]. She served in the [[Baltic Fleet]] and was reclassified as a [[training ship]] in 1880. ''Sevastopol'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] five years later, but was not sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] until 1897.

==Description==
''Sevastopol'' was {{convert|300|ft|m|1}} long [[length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]], with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert |50|ft|4|in|m|1}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|22|ft|2|in|m|1}} (forward) and {{convert|24|ft|m|1}} (aft). She displaced {{convert|6135|LT|t}} and she was fitted with a blunt iron [[naval ram|ram]] at her [[bow (ship)|bow]].<ref name=m7>Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 173</ref> ''Sevastopol'' was considered to be a good sea boat and her total crew numbered 607 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=r5>''Russian Ironclad Frigates Sevastopol and Petropavlovsk'', p. 415</ref>

The ship was fitted with a [[Marine steam engine#Back acting|horizontal return-connecting-rod steam engine]]<ref name=m7/> built by the [[Izhorskiye Zavody|Izhora Works]] of [[Saint Petersburg]].<ref name=ts4/> It drove a single two-bladed propeller using steam that was provided by an unknown number of rectangular [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s.<ref name=m7/> During the ship's [[sea trial]]s, the engine produced a total of {{convert|3088|ihp|lk=in}} and gave the ship a maximum speed of {{convert|13.95|kn|lk=in}}. The ship carried a maximum of {{convert|400|LT|t}} of coal, but her endurance is unknown.<ref name=ts4>Tredea & Sozea, p. 414</ref> She was [[schooner]]-rigged with three [[mast (sailing)| mast]]s.<ref name=m7/>

As a heavy frigate, ''Sevastopol'' was intended to be armed with 54 of the most powerful guns available to the Russians, the {{convert|7.72|in|adj=on|0}} 60-pounder [[smoothbore]] gun, and four long 36-pounder smoothbores. Her armament was revised when she was converted to an [[ironclad]] and she was completed with an armament of thirty-two 60-pounder guns, four on the upper deck as [[chase gun]]s and 28 on the lower deck. In 1868, one chase gun and two guns on the lower deck were replaced by {{convert|8|in|0|adj=on}} [[Rifling|rifled]] guns and 11 more of the 60-pounders were replaced by seven 8-inch guns two years later. In 1877, her armament was changed again to 14 eight-inch guns on the lower deck and two more on the upper deck. Also mounted on the upper deck were one {{convert|6|in|0|adj=on}} and ten {{convert|3.4|in|0|adj=on}} rifled guns.<ref name=ts4/>

The entire ship's side was protected with wrought-iron armor<ref name=r5/> that extended {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m|1}} below the [[waterline]].<ref>Watts, p. 67</ref> It was {{convert|4.5|in|0}} thick amidships, backed by {{convert|10|in|0}} of [[teak]], that thinned to {{convert|3|in|0}}, backed by six inches of teak, in steps beginning {{convert|50|ft|m|1}} from the ship's ends.<ref name=r5/>

==Construction and service==
''Sevastopol'', named for the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854<U+2013>1855)|Siege of Sevastopol]] during the [[Crimean War]],<ref>Silverstone, p. 384</ref> was [[Keel|laid down]] on 7 September 1860 as a 58-gun heavy frigate at [[Kronstadt]]. She was reordered as (converted into) a 32-gun armored frigate on 26 July 1862 while still under construction.<ref name=ts4/> The ship was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 12 August 1864 and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 8 July 1865. She served with the Baltic Fleet for her entire career and was reclassified as a training ship on 23 March 1880. ''Sevastopol'' was decommissioned on 15 June 1885 and sold for breaking up in May 1897.<ref name=ts4/>
