'''Mileena'''{{ref|a|[Note 1]}} is a [[player character|player]] and a one-time [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] character from the ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' series of [[fighting game|fighting video games]]. Mileena was originally known as an [[assassination|assassin]] in service of the Outworld's evil emperor [[Shao Kahn]] and an [[evil twin]] sister of his stepdaughter [[Kitana (Mortal Kombat)|Princess Kitana]] but is later revealed to be a deformed [[cloning|clone]] of her, created by the sorcerer [[Shang Tsung]].

Mileena's personality is usually defined by her fierce rivalry with Kitana and lust for power. Since her introduction as Kitana's [[palette swap]] character in ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' in 1993, Mileena gained significant popularity, becoming one of ''Mortal Kombat''{{'}}s most iconic characters, used in the promotion of later games as a designated [[sex symbol]] and was a central character of ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]]''. However, her appearances in the various other media in the franchise have been relatively rare and minor as compared to these of Kitana.

The character received a mixed<U+2014>mostly due to the remarkable dualism of her character design<U+2014>but generally favorable critical reception.

== In video games ==
After the ruler of the other dimensional realm Outworld, [[Shao Kahn]], conquered the realm of Edenia and merged it with his own, he decided he would keep the former king's daughter [[Kitana (Mortal Kombat)|Kitana]] alive and raise her as his own. Though she grew up knowing nothing of her origin, the emperor nonetheless feared that one day Kitana would discover her true parentage and turn against him, and so he ordered [[Shang Tsung]] to bring to life a more vicious and loyal version of Kitana that could take her place if necessary. This was done by fusing her essence with a Tarkatan warrior from [[Baraka (Mortal Kombat)|Baraka]]'s race. The process was not a complete success, however, as the hybrid clone was disfigured with the hideous mouth of the Tarkata. Instead of replacing Kitana, as originally planned, Mileena would be used to spy on her and to ensure her allegiance to him, and so Shao Kahn introduced Mileena to Kitana as her supposedly lost twin sister. The two thus grew up together as his daughters and personal assassins, though Mileena (who has became a companion of Baraka) privately grew to harbor a great bitterness and jealousy towards Kitana, whom Kahn favored over her.<ref>[http://www.mksecrets.net/mkd/eng/mkd-bios.php#Mileena Mortal Kombat: Deception - Bios], Mortal Kombat Secrets</ref>

As Kahn feared, Kitana did finally find the truth about her past and so Mileena was ordered to keep close watch over her rival when Kitana secretly allied with Earthrealm warriors during the events of ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' (1993).<ref name=prima101>Bryan Dawson, ''Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (Prima Official Game Guide)'', Prima Games 2006, p.101</ref> Mileena, determined to stop her twin at any cost,<ref>''Mortal Kombat II'' Game Gear manual, p.20</ref> is then murdered<ref>''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'' SNES manual, p.25</ref><ref name=mkt/> by Kitana, her soul descending into the Netherrealm. In ''[[Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks]]'' (2005), the [[beat'em up]] retelling of ''Mortal Kombat II'', Mileena (voiced by Lita Lopez) fights against [[Liu Kang]] and [[Kung Lao]] alongside [[Jade (Mortal Kombat)|Jade]] and Kitana, but is defeated by the two Shaolin warriors and flees to the Wasteland to seek help from [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]].{{ref|b|[Note 2]}} Damned to the Netherrealm after her death, Mileena swears fealty to its ruler [[List of Mortal Kombat characters#Shinnok|Shinnok]]. During the events of ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]'' (1996), Shao Kahn decides to resurrect Mileena so her skills as a vicious fighter would help him defeat Earth's chosen warriors, also magically granting her the ability to read Kitana's thoughts.<ref name=mkt>''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' PlayStation manual, p.19</ref> Shinnok sees this as an opportunity to covertly monitor the events unfolding in Earthrealm and so he allows her to return to life.<ref>[http://www.mksecrets.net/umk3/eng/umk3-bios.php#Mileena Mortal Kombat Secrets: Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 - Bios]</ref> After Kahn is defeated, Mileena is summoned back to the Netherrealm. In ''[[Mortal Kombat 4#Mortal Kombat Gold|Mortal Kombat Gold]]'' (1999), she assists in Shinnok's invasion of Edenia, but allows her sister to escape from a dungeon. Following Shinnok's defeat, Mileena comes to Kitana' palace and demands the power over Edenia to be shared with her but Kitana refuses and, when attacked, traps Mileena, locking her away in a dungeon.

Mileena remains imprisoned for years, until [[List of Mortal Kombat characters#Onaga|Onaga]] the Dragon King began his own invasion of Edenia, during which she is freed from her imprisonment by her ally Baraka. During the events of ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]]'' (2004), Mileena (voiced by Johanna A<U+00F1>onuevo) is ordered by Onaga to pose as Kitana in order to confuse and misdirect his enemies.<ref>Bryan Dawson, ''Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (Prima Official Game Guide)'', Prima Games 2006, p.118</ref> However, as Mileena begins the game's titular deception, she develops a hidden agenda and decides to take control of both the forces of Edenia and Onaga's own undead army for herself. In the game's story mode (Konquest), Mileena also trains the young [[List of Mortal Kombat characters#Shujinko|Shujinko]] in the Outworld and fights against Jade.<ref>[http://uk.xbox.gamespy.com/xbox/mortal-kombat-deception/guide/page_25.html Mortal Kombat: Deception - xbox - Walkthrough and Guide  - Page 25], GameSpy</ref> In ''[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]]'' (2006), Mileena seizes Shao Kahn's fortress, still under the guise of Kitana, and decides to continue her charade until the Edenian forces were corrupted enough to follow her under the true identity. Though at first confident that Outworld is hers to rule, Mileena is forced to reveal herself and surrender to the returning Shao Kahn when he mounts an offensive against the fortress to re-instate his rule over Outworld. The emperor then commands her to capture Shujinko, who would be used as a bargaining chip in gaining Onaga as an ally. Mileena, pretending to be Kitana, succeeds in capturing Shujinko, taking him to Shao Kahn's palace. But having tasted power for herself, she is no longer content with being his minion and still plans to get the throne of Edenia back for herself. She is later killed by Shang Tsung during the final all-out battle at the Soulnado.{{ref|c|[Note 3]}}

Mileena returns in [[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|''Mortal Kombat'' (2011)]], an alternative-timeline retelling of the original ''Mortal Kombat'' trilogy that brought some major changes to her character. In this game, Mileena (voiced by [[Karen Strassman]], who was also hired for the next sequel<ref>[http://www.karenstrassman.com/karen_credits.pdf Credits], karenstrassman.com</ref>) was created by Shang Tsung in the "Flesh Pit" and introduced during the second tournament, instead of many years earlier. Meant to be a loyal replacement for Kitana, she is physically and mentally damaged, her animalistic rage controlled only by Shao Kahn as she uses her lascivious behavior to lure victims and then slaughter and devour them.<ref name=stabby>[http://www.joystiq.com/2011/01/15/video-mileena-gets-stab-happy-in-mortal-kombat Video: Mileena gets stab-happy in Mortal Kombat], Joystiq, Jan 15th 2011</ref> In the game's story mode, she serves as an opponent for Kitana, Jade, [[Kurtis Stryker]] and [[List of Mortal Kombat characters#Kabal|Kabal]], and is referred to by Shao Kahn as his "true daughter"; when Kahn appaers to be killed, his minions even discuss making her a new ruler of Outworld. Her new personality is much more immature (even [[Infantilism (physiological disorder)|infantile]]<ref name=Tara>{{cite web|author=Tara Babcock |url=http://www.impulsegamer.com/tara20hottestvideogamebabesbytarababcock.html |title=Tara's G-Spot - Games that hit the spot, according to Tara Babcock - 20 HOTTEST VIDEO GAME BABES BY TARA BABCOCK |publisher=www.impulsegamer.com |date=2008-08-02 |accessdate=2011-12-15}}</ref>) than in the previous games, and even Kitana (in her uncanonical ending) is shown to be an unusually sympathic towards her.<ref>[http://www.g4tv.com/videos/52620/mortal-kombat-kitanas-ending/ Mortal Kombat Kitana's Ending in High Definition], G4tv.com, April 25, 2011</ref>

[[File:Milkitana.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mortal Kombat (comics)|''Mortal Kombat'' series]] comic book depicting the ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' era original versions of [[Kitana (Mortal Kombat)|Kitana]] and Mileena created by [[John Tobias]] in 1993, as drawn by [[Greg Horn]]. In her initial appearances, Mileena was clad in a [[Palette swap|palette-swapped]] versions of her sister's costumes. In 2012, an ''MKII'' style costume for Mileena was added exclusively for the [[PlayStation Vita|Vita]] version of ''Mortal Kombat''<ref>Jordan Mallory, [http://www.joystiq.com/2012/04/27/mortal-kombat-vita-also-includes-exclusive-klassic-kostumes-for/ Mortal Kombat Vita also includes exclusive klassic kostumes for female ninjas], Joystiq, Apr 27th 2012</ref>]]

Mileena was the first evil [[Portrayal of women in video games|female character]] to appear in the series, created and initially developed by [[John Tobias]]. Tobias said that she was created just to accommodate another palette swapped character, adding: "I took advantage of Kitana and Mileena being masked sisters to make a play on the [[veil]] myth<U+2026> One sister is beautiful. One is ugly. One is good. One is evil. Choose wisely before asking one on a date."<ref>[http://classicmk.com/index.php?topic=2282.0 Kitsune, Kitana's Origin - ClassicMK] (based on a series posts by [http://twitter.com/#!/therealsaibot John Tobias (therealsaibot) on Twitter])</ref> According to [[Acclaim Entertainment]]'s producer Robert O'Farrel, the game was given two female fighters so it would better compete against [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Street Fighter II]]'',<ref>"Immortal Kombat", ''The One Amiga'' 75 (December 1994), p.31-33</ref> which had [[Chun-Li|only one]].

Only in ''Mortal Kombat Gold'' she uses also a European style [[longsword]] (Scorpion's weapon in the both versions of ''Mortal Kombat 4'').  Mileena's [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)#Animality|Animality]] in ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'' has her transforming into a small [[skunk]].

Physically, Mileena is largely identical to Kitana, the most glaring exception being her half-Tarkata face with large and exposed fang-like teeth (they got noticeably downsized for ''Deception'' and ''Armageddon''). Boon described Mileena as "Anti-Kitana" and said that her large "sharp, nasty teeth" have been not originally planned and were only drawn for her infamous [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatality]] "[[man-eater|Man-Eater]]"<ref name=evolution /> (featured in ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'', too),<ref>Mileena's Kombat Kard video for ''Mortal Kombat: Deception''</ref> in which she sucks up the entire body of their victims and then spits out their clean bones.<ref>"Get Your Kicks With These", ''Albany Times Union'', October 4, 1995</ref> After ''Mortal Kombat II'', her teeth were almost never used again during gameplay until ''Mortal Kombat 2011'' (in a leap attack to bite an opponent in the neck and in one Fatality to gnaw on the killed enemy's severed head),<ref>[http://screwattack.com/videos/Mortal-Kombat-Mileena-Examined Mortal Kombat Mileena Examined], GameTrailers, January 20, 2011{{deadlink|date=August 2012}}</ref> with a sole exception of one Fatality in ''Deception'' in which she tears off the opponent's head with them. Mileena's skin color appears to be at times mildly darker than Kitana's, but is always lighter than Jade's. After the two were given more varying appearances in ''Mortal Kombat Gold'' (hairstyle for Kitana-derived characters is loose in ''Mortal Kombat II'' and pinned back in ''Ultimate MK3''), Mileena's always-black hair is usually much shorter than Kitana's and is most often worn gathered in a [[ponytail]]. One element of Mileena's anatomy that has often changed is her eyes. As a supposed twin sister, she shared Kitana's eyes in ''Mortal Kombat II''; her eyes then became "undead" all-white (similar to the eyes of Scorpion) in ''Ultimate MK3''. In ''Deception'', ''Armageddon'' and ''Shaolin Monks'', Mileena's eyes return to normal, but with yellow pupils (Kitana's eyes are brown). In ''Mortal Kombat 2011'', however, she has Baraka-like yellow eyes with slit pupils (her eyes are also sometimes seen as glowing whole), except of her alternate ''Ultimate MK3'' style costume (available through pre-order bonuses and later  in a [[downloadable content]] package<ref>[http://kotaku.com/5806097/mortal-kombat-adds-klassic-costumes-klassic-fatalities-and-skarlet-with-its-first-dlk Mortal Kombat Adds Klassic Costumes, Klassic Fatalities and Skarlet With Its First DLK], Kotaku, May 26, 2011</ref>) in which she has human eyes once again.<ref>[http://shoryuken.com/content/gamestop-advertisement-shows-classic-scorpion-mileena-outfits-3974/ GameStop Advertisement Shows Classic Scorpion and Mileena Outfits], Shoryuken{{deadlink|date=August 2012}}</ref>

Just like Kitana and Jade, Mileena was originally portrayed by [[Katalin Zamiar]] in ''Mortal Kombat II'', Becky Gable taking over the role in ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3''. Mileena's main color has been either a shade of [[purple]] or [[magenta]] in various installments (including when masquerading as Kitana in ''Deception'') and their outfits did not differ in a significant way (more than just having different color patterns) until ''Mortal Kombat Gold''. Since then, her costumes have been generally getting more skimpy with every new game,<ref name=evolution>[http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/115/1159114p1.html The Evolution of Mortal Kombat Fatalities], IGN, April 7, 2011 {{deadlink|date=September 2012}}</ref> including always having an exposed midriff since ''Deception'' (Steve Beran, character designer for this game, said: "I wanted to give Mileena an [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabic]] feel to her costume and the final version showed a lot more skin and her mask developed into more of a veil."<ref name="krypt">[http://home.comcast.net/~johnt3/mkdkrypt.htm Mortal Kombat: Deception Krypt Koffins]</ref>{{ref|e|[Note 5]}}). Mileena's main costume in ''Deception'' and ''Armageddon'' is actually mostly black and features long flowing arm sleeves, a back-only [[loincloth]] and a partially transparent veil. In ''Shaolin Monks'', Mileena appears half-naked (her costume made largely of just belts of leather and scraps of fabric), barefoot (with a bandaged midfoot) and again wearing a veil in place of a mask (the veil also returns as part of her formal outfit in ''Mortal Kombat 2011''). In the 2011 reboot game, her prime costume is based on her famous provocative alternate from ''Deception'', but more detailed and again featuring a mask. In all, in this game she has the largest number of costumes out of all characters in the entire series. Her "Flesh Pit" alternate costume in 2011 game is made of just some loose bandages put around her otherwise completely naked body,<ref name=destructoid>Hamza CTZ Aziz, [http://www.destructoid.com/the-new-winner-for-skimpiest-outfit-in-a-videogame-ever-199370.phtml The new winner for skimpiest 'outfit' in a videogame ever], Destructoid, 4.22.2011</ref>{{ref|f|[Note 6]}} marking the first time that she has appeared unmasked by default. {{-}}

=== Gameplay ===
Mileena is a hidden playable character in ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'', in which she needs to be unlocked using a special "Kombat Kode",<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/ds/action/ultimatemortalkombat/cheats.html Ultimate Mortal Kombat Cheats, Ultimate Mortal Kombat Walkthrough], GameSpot.com</ref> but is available from the start in the compilation game ''[[Mortal Kombat Trilogy]]'' (appearing as seen in ''Ultimate MK3''). She is not playable in ''Shaolin Monks'', but she appears as a sub-[[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] character alongside Kitana and Jade (as well as an optional boss in a secret stage encounter). Mileena also appears in the [[super deformed]]-style "cute" form in every [[minigame]] through the series ("Chess Kombat", "Puzzle Kombat" and "Motor Kombat"{{ref|g|[Note 7]}}). She utilises sai in most of her Fatalities, including to immobilize her opponents during the killing sequence, and in some of them she pretends to kiss her victims.<ref name=evolution /> There was a popular but completely false urban legend regarding a supposed "Nudality" finishing move in ''Mortal Kombat II''.<ref>{{cite web|first=John|last=Scalza|title=April Fool's Day Scams|date=2003-04-01|url=http://www.gamingtarget.com/article.php?artid=5593|publisher=Gaming Target|accessdate=2010-10-23}}</ref><ref>Jason Wilson, Adam Hernandez, ''Mortal Kombat: Prima Official Game Guide'', Prima Games 2011, p.7</ref>

Mileena was sometimes seen as the best character of ''Mortal Kombat II''. According to ''[[GamePro]]'''s official strategy guide, while [[Jax (Mortal Kombat)|Jax]] is the best overall fighter in ''Mortal Kombat II'', Mileena's "massive advantage" over him made her an ultimate "queen of the hill" ("with her rapid sai-throwing ability, [[Teleportation|teleport]] attacks, and deadly [[Combo (video gaming)|combos]], this beautiful assassin lands atop our ratings"); in their test, Mileena was especially effective against Jax, [[Reptile (Mortal Kombat)|Reptile]] and Shang Tsung (''[[Amiga Format]]'' similarily noted that she and Kitana were always "so much faster" that "poor Jax [...] ended getting his head kicked in every time"<ref>[http://amr.abime.net/issue_223 ''Amiga Format'' 67] (January 1995), p.92</ref>).<ref>''Mortal Kombat II Pro--Strategy Guide'', ''GamePro'' 59 (June 1994), p.82-83</ref> She was also ranked as the game's best overall fighter by ''[[Sega Visions]]'' for her high speed and reach, and her teleport kick that can dodge projectiles.<ref>"Sega Saturn Features: Mortal Kombat II". ''Sega Visions'' 21 (October/November 1994), p.25</ref> According to ''[[CU Amiga]]'', Mileena was "third only to Jax and Liu Kang for sheer brilliance," being a "somewhat misleading character" whose moves need to be "learnt the right way to put them all together to be devastating."<ref>"Player's Guide: Mortal Kombat II". ''[http://amr.abime.net/issue_624 CU Amiga Magazine]'', February 1995, p.62</ref> According to ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'', this "deadly woman [...] can hold her own against any man in the game" and her players can use her "lightning speed" and the sai blasts to overcome other players.<ref>''EGM's Complete Guide to Mortal Kombat II'' (supplement to ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'')</ref> ''[[Computer and Video Games|C+VG]]'' wrote that all of ''Mortal Kombat II'' characters are "well-balanced" and "potentially excellent", but still the teleport kick of the "very fast" Mileena was singled out as "the best surprising move in the game."<ref>"Tougher than the best: Mortal Kombat II", ''Computer + Video Games'' 154 (September 1994), p.48-51</ref> However, according to ''[[Nintendo Power]]'', Mileena's original powers "may prove insufficient" for using her with same effectiveness in ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'', where most of the other characters got some additional special moves.<ref>"Full Coverage: Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3". ''Nintendo Power'' 91 (December 1996), p.71</ref> ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' wrote that "she's pretty much identical to the last time."<ref name=ss>"Showcases: Mortal Kombat 3". ''Official Sega Saturn Magazine'' 6 (April 1996), p.48</ref> On the other hand, ''Total 64'' wrote that in ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' Mileena is "a damn good fighter, has got plenty of powerful moves" and is "an all round classy fighting star!"<ref>''Total 64'' 2/97, page 59</ref>

According to [[GameSpy]]'s guide to ''Deception'', in this game Mileena "has some solid offensive tools" and "a few solid combos up her sleeve, as well as a few pop-up attacks that are extremely quick and open up brief juggle opportunities," her weaknesses being a very short range of her sai and having relatively very few ranged attacks in general.<ref name=gs/> According to [[Prima Games]]' official guide for ''Armageddon'', Mileena (rated overall 6/10) is a "punisher" type character and a better fighter than Kitana ("seems to have the upper hand between the two"), but while she "is able to punish from any range and even interrupt high attacks and projectiles, the damage she inflicts is minor."<ref name=prima>Bryan Dawson, ''Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (Prima Official Game Guide)'', Prima Games 2006, p.221-224</ref> According to Prima's official guide for the 2011's ''Mortal Kombat'', Mileena is well-balanced and universal, displaying neither particular weaknesses nor adventages that would result in a one-sided battle against anyone else, and always winning around half of fights against different characters (40-60%, depending on a character).<ref>Jason Wilson, Adam Hernandez, ''Mortal Kombat: Prima Official Game Guide'', Prima Games 2011, p.157</ref>

== In other media ==
Mileena was one of the minor characters featured in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Live Tour]]'' stage show in 1995, played by Jennifer DeCosta. She also appeared as a minor recurring character in [[Mortal Kombat (comics)|Malibu's ''Mortal Kombat'' comic books]] published in 1994-1995. In the comics, Mileena first appeared in the comic  miniseries ''Goro: Prince of Pain'' as part of a team led by Kitana with orders to find the missing Goro in Outworld. She is shown having reservations about Kitana's true loyalty (though she never speaks about it to anyone) and considers herself to be "Shao Kahn's true daughter". Mileena duels [[Sonya Blade]] twice, losing both times. She was also featured in a one-shot special entitled ''Kitana and Mileena: Sister Act'', which explained their past: Mileena is shown in this comic as a creation ordered by Shao Kahn, though he would never let her replace Kitana.

[[File:Mileena movie2 2.jpg|thumb|left|Dana Hee as Mileena in the film ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]''. In 2011, [[UGO Networks|UGO]] listed Mileena among "hot women ninjas" for how she "plays dirty in a [[mud wrestling]] battle against [[Sonya Blade]] that ends with one girl down, one girl out of breath and the few audience members who made it that long into the movie pleasantly surprised."<ref>[http://www.ugo.com/girls/hot-ninja-girls?page=2 Ninja Chicks are So Freakin' Hot], UGO.com, January 5, 2011</ref>|alt=This image shows a masked woman with braided black hair, in a martial arts pose, wearing an a pink-and-black outfit.]]

Mileena appeared briefly in the film ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'' in 1997 in a [[cameo appearance|cameo]]-like role,<ref>[http://www.ugo.com/movies/dana-hee-in-mortal-kombat-annihilation Dana Hee in Mortal Kombat: Annhilation - UGO.com]</ref> where she was played by a kickboxer Dana Lynn Hee (Dana Hee), and was only featured in one scene in which she ambushes Sonya a desert. The two duel before Sonya traps Mileena on the ground and kicks her in the head, snapping her neck. After this, Mileena's tattoo comes to life and flies away. Dana Hee described her role as "an evil, mysterious figure that leaves you wondering, 'Who is she?'"<ref name=bb/> Despite being a trainer and stunt double for Kitana's actress [[Talisa Soto]] in both of ''Mortal Kombat'' films,<ref name=cby>''Current Biography Yearbook 2008'', H.

Her pink-and-black costume is a palette swap of Kitana's main film attire (a sleeveless corset-like shirt and pants) with an added mouth mask and has blue eyes. Mileena has only one spoken line in the film ("You wish" in response to the question of "Kitana?") and it was the only time she has ever been shown with a [[braid]]ed hair, similar to Kitana's film hairstyle. In ''Mortal Kombat II: Annihilation'', the film's novelization penned by Jerome Preisler, Mileena's scene was changed and her looks are different, but she is also killed in a fight when attacking Sonya.{{ref|m|[Note 12]}}

Mileena appeared in the 1999 episode "Shadow of a Doubt" of the television series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Konquest]]'', in which she had no direct relation to Kitana and was here depicted as an initially very repulsive and aggressive Outworld warrior sent by Shao Kahn to assassinate the weakened Kung Lao, with a magic spell placed over her to give her Kitana's look (for a while, he even called her his "new daughter"). Mileena, wearing a green costume, succeeded in seducing Kung Lao, but could not bring herself to kill him during their night of passion and was also explicitly warned by Shang Tsung to not do it. She makes excuses for Kahn and later fights an inconclusive duel against Kitana, broken by Shao Kahn.

In ''Legacy'', the adolescent Mileena is clad in violet, does not appear to be Kitana's twin and is seen wearing a mask only in some of the animated sections (in which both of them are wearing outfits similar to these worn by them in ''Mortal Kombat II''). She is shown spar-dueling against Kitana and losing to her, and killing and devouring a palace guard in a fit of insanity, as well as killing impostors of King Jerrod, Kitana's biological father, in a team together with Kitana. When the two are eventually sent by Shao Kahn on a mission to assassinate a man who is really King Jerrod, she kills hims with a double sai throw to the chest when he was talking to Kitana.

=== Reception ===
Mileena's addition to the series was well received and she quickly became one of the most popular and recognizable ''Mortal Kombat'' characters. Her debut appearance in ''Mortal Kombat II'' was met with a favorable critical reception: ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' called Kitana and Mileena, "leggy ladies who wear masks", to be "an interesting step toward [[political correctness]]" as "a far cry from [[Little Miss Muffet]],"<ref>''The Miami Herald'', August 26, 1994</ref> ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]'' said they are "far nastier than [[Sonya Blade|that martial-artless aerobics instructor]] from the [[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|first game]],"<ref>''Austin American-Statesman'', September 8, 1994</ref> while ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' called her "beautiful, graceful, beguiling and strong, but most of all, deadly"<ref>"Game Reviews: Mortal Kombat II" (SNES). ''Nintendo Power'' 64 (September 1994), p.15</ref> and "a dangerous enemy: cruel, cold and calculating."<ref>"Game Reviews: Mortal Kombat II" (Game Boy). ''Nintendo Power'' 65 (October 1994), p.92</ref> In 2009, [[UGO Networks|UGO]] ranked Mileena as fifth on their top list of ''Mortal Kombat'' characters, citing her at that time rare presence as an evil female player character (a [[taboo]]-breaking novelty in video games in 1993) and adding that her brutal attacks, revealing outfits and [[slut]]ty attitude made her a fan favorite,<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090123012759/http://ugo.com/games/mortal-kombat-characters/?cur=mileena Top 11 Mortal Kombat Characters], UGO.com</ref> while ''[[FHM]]'' listed her among the nine sexiest "bad girls of videogame land", adding that "perhaps no one is as menacing as Mileena."<ref>Gelo Gonzales, [http://www.fhm.com.ph/entertainment/games/article/1688/page/3 The bad girls of videogame land], ''FHM'', September 11, 2009</ref> ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' made her share the eighth place with Kitana and Sonya on the list of "hottest women in video games" in 2010,<ref>[http://www.complex.com/video-games/2010/11/the-50-hottest-women-in-video-games/sonya-blade-kitana-mileena#gallery The 50 Hottest Women In Video Games], Complex.com, November 8, 2010{{deadlink|date=August 2012}}</ref>, also ranking her alone as eight in the 2011 list of the "most diabolical video game she-villains".<ref>[http://www.complex.com/video-games/2011/06/25-most-diabolical-she-villains/mileena Bad Girls Club: The 25 Most Diabolical Video Game She-Villains], Complex.com, June 30, 2011</ref> In 2011, [[IGN]] listed Mileena as one of the series' "four main characters" alongside Liu Kang, Scorpion and Sub-Zero ("at first blush she seems like your quintessential sultry video-game vixen, but the mask comes off and she's got a gaping mouth filled to the brim with dagger-like teeth"),<ref name=evolution /> [[Bright Hub]] included her among the "top ten awesome" ''Mortal Kombat'' characters as well as well as one of the sexiest ("second only to the gorgeous Kitana"),<ref>Anurag Ghosh, Bill Fulks, [http://www.brighthub.com/video-games/pc/articles/126073.aspx#secn_4 Ten Awesome Mortal Kombat Characters: Mileena], Bright Hub, Oct 27, 2011</ref> and [[CraveOnline]] stated she is "without question" one of the "most beloved" characters in the ''Mortal Kombat'' universe.<ref>[http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/41919/mortal-kombat-toothy-look-mileena Mortal Kombat - A Toothy Look at Mileena], Dread Central, January 16th, 2011</ref> That same year, Polish web portal [[Wirtualna Polska]] featured Millena among the top ten villainesses in gaming, describing her as "absolutely phenomenal, simply dripping with sex" but advising to skip trying to check under her mask,<ref>[http://gry.wp.pl/galeria/10-najseksowniejszych-negatywnych-bohaterek,179679/4.html Mileena <U+2013> Mortal Kombat - 10 najseksowniejszych negatywnych bohaterek - Imperium gier], WP.PL, 2011-07-31 {{pl icon}}</ref> while an American model Tara Babcock ranked her as the 11th "hottest video game babe", adding that in the reboot game "Mileena embodies a childish character through her fighting style and behavior."<ref name=Tara /> Also in 2011, Mileena's breasts were ranked as the 31st and ninth finest in gaming by [[GameFront]] and ''Complex'', respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefront.com/the-greatest-boobs-in-video-game-history-gallery/ |title=The Greatest Boobs In Video Game History (Gallery) |publisher=GameFront |date= May 5, 2011 |author=Ross Lincoln}}</ref><ref>Drea Avellan, [http://www.complex.com/video-games/2012/06/the-20-best-pairs-of-boobies-in-video-games#13 The 20 Best Pairs Of Boobies In Video Games], Complex.com, Jun 20, 2012</ref>

On the other hand, much of the reception was mixed due to her conflicting looks and unstable personality, although these elements were often also regarded positively for a variety of reasons, including a sheer shock value. In the book ''Interacting With Video'', the sisters were held as an example of a "highly eroticized [[Dragon Lady (stereotype)|dragon lady]]" of video games, with Mileena's "Man-Eater" Fatality (''[[Commodore User|Commodore User Amiga]]'' called it "the kiss of death to end all kisses"<ref>''CU Amiga'' 12/94, p.41</ref>) described as "a high powered kiss that evokes ''[[vagina dentata]]''."<ref>Patricia Marks Greenfield, Rodney R. Cocking, ''Interacting With Video'', Greenwood Publishing Group 1996 (p.34)</ref> For this reason, Mileena shared the seventh place with Kitana on [[GamesRadar]]'s 2006 list of top seven "girls kissing girls" in 2006.<ref>Mikel Reparaz, [http://www.gamesradar.com/the-top-7-girl-on-girl-kisses/ The Top 7...

However, some reception was more negative.

== Notes ==
<small>
:1.{{note|a|Note 1}} Her name is variably pronounced as either "Ma-lee-na" (''Mortal Kombat II'' to ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'') or "Mi-lee-na" (later games) through the series. Her name appears to be a form of East European first name [[Milena (name)|Milena]], which is derived from a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] word that means "gracious" in English.
:2.{{note|b|Note 2}} Another, optional secret stage<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/mkshaolin/cheats.html Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks Hints & Cheats],  GameSpot.com</ref> encounter against Mileena ends with her tossing Kitana into a portal and then following after her, where they presumably fought to the death. In the game, Mileena shares her Fatality with Jade, while Liu Kang uncanonically kills Jade by stabbing her in the eyes with Mileena's sai.
:3.{{note|c|Note 3}} In Mileena's uncanonical ending in ''Armageddon'', she defeats [[List of Mortal Kombat characters#Blaze|Blaze]], causing herself and Kitana to fuse together momentarily. When separated, Mileena finds that she has taken Kitana's facial features, while Kitana has been cursed with Mileena's Tarkatan jaw visage. Mileena is now able to take her "rightful" place as princess of Edenia and rules in Kitana's place, locking her sister away in the Edenian palace dungeon, where she eventually goes insane.<ref name="MKAend">[http://mortalkombatwarehouse.com/mka/mileena/ Mortal Kombat: Armageddon: Mileena], Mortal Kombat Warehouse</ref>
:4.{{note|d|Note 4}} Curiously, Mileena's sai are clearly dull-pointed in much of the non-gameplay parts of ''Deception'', including the intro sequence and the VS screen picture. This is actually a more realistic depiction, as (contrary to a popular opinion and many appearances in pop culture) the traditional sai is a blunt, round-pointed melee weapon that was not designed for neither stabbing or cutting, and which thus can be used well for non-lethal combat. Another ''Mortal Kombat'' character using sai is [[List of Mortal Kombat characters#Li Mei|Li Mei]], introduced in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]]'' in place of Mileena who was the absent from the game due to being imprisoned.
:5.{{note|e|Note 5}} Two concept pictures<ref>[http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110608211318/mk/images/2/2c/Mortal_Kombat_Deception_Mileena_Concepts.jpg ''Deception'' concept arts in question], wikia.com</ref> for Mileena's design in ''Deception'' by Steve Beran were included in the game's bonus gallery "The Krypt". According to the original caption, one of them was originally supposed to be Kitana, but was developed into the primary Mileena costume, while the other one became Mileena's alternate.<ref name=krypt /> Another publicly released early concept art,<ref>[http://www.totalmortalkombat.com/mksm/art/jade_kitana_mileena_concept.jpg ''MKSM'' concept art in question], totalmortalkombat.com</ref> created for ''Shaolin Monks'', had a rather small-chested Mileena wearing the outfit that appears to be combining her old costumes from ''Mortal Kombat II'' and ''Mortal Kombat Gold''. An early concept art of Mileena for the 2011 game was also published by the character designer Vincent Proce in 2011.<ref>[http://www.fdmk.net/?mode=archive&id=4590 Vincent Proce Posts Mortal Kombat (2011) Character Design Koncepts], FDMK, 09/01/2011 (with links to Proce's blog)</ref>
:6.{{note|f|Note 6}} Players who unlock the Flesh Pit costume receive the [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievement / trophy]] called "Best...Alternate...EVER!"<ref>[http://www.xbox360achievements.org/game/mortal-kombat/achievement/51566-Best---Alternate---Ever-.html Mortal Kombat - Best...Alternate...Ever! Achievement], Xbox360Achievements.org</ref><ref>[http://www.ps3trophies.org/game/mortal-kombat/trophy/29935-Best---Alternate---Ever-.html Mortal Kombat - Best...Alternate...Ever! Trophy], PS3Trophies.org</ref> Mileena (or possibly some earlier clone) was also shown as having Tarkatan blades on her arms in Mileena's promotional trailer for the same game.<ref name=stabby />
:7.{{note|g|Note 7}} Mileena's Kombat Karting special weapon is a brief speed boost that is very useful to save her from a Fatality in a death trap or at the finish line, and makes her a "great character" to use in the arena Speedster.<ref>Bryan Dawson, ''Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (Prima Official Game Guide)'', Prima Games 2006, p.38&80</ref> When playing offline, it also allows the player to "steal first place right at the finish line before the AI gets its own miraculous speed boost".<ref>[http://uk.xbox.gamespy.com/xbox/mortal-kombat-armageddon-tba/guide/page_5.html Mortal Kombat: Armageddon - xbox - Walkthrough and Guide  - Page 5], GameSpy</ref>
:8.{{note|i|Note 8}} Zamiar, who has portrayed Mileena in ''Mortal Kombat II'', plays a black-and-purple outfit clad, sai-wielding, masked, silent character identified only as "Female Ninja" in the film's credits. Her character is appearing briefly in a few scenes, appearing to attack [[Ho-Sung Pak]]'s (Liu Kang in the original ''Mortal Kombat'' and ''Mortal Kombat II'') character Lang and then mysteriously disappear.
:9.{{note|j|Note 9}} In which Mileena-inspired character Keiko is shown defeating and killing [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]]-like Ronan in what then turns out to be a match in an [[arcade game]] called "Mortal Conflict" (a pun on ''Mortal Kombat''), as played and commented on by Roxy (Freefall) and Grunge, two of the comic's main characters. The issue was written by [[Brandon Choi]] and drawn by [[J. Scott Campbell]].
:10.{{note|k|Note 10}} In a short spoof scene parody-referencing the ''Mortal Kombat'' games, the show's character Janet is depicted to be dressed as Mileena and killed Fatality-style by the main character [[Cleveland Brown]] dressed as Scorpion. The scene appears at around the 7 minute mark.
:11.{{note|l|Note 11}} Chibi was quoted as saying: "I like the character because she's pretty insane and vicious and seems like she'd be very attractive, but then has this mouth full of heinous sharp teeth."<ref>[http://www.scribd.com/doc/56463409/INKED-Girls-of-Rock INKED Girls of Rock - Scribd]</ref>
:12.{{note|m|Note 12}} In Preisler's novel, Mileenaa appears in a scene similar to this in the film, but set in a mist-covered jungle wilderness. She attacks Sonya just as [[Smoke (Mortal Kombat)|Smoke]] attacks Jax, but looks completely different, with unmasked human face and yellow-red-black eyes,<ref>Chapter 11, page 3: "(...) an angular, exotic-looking woman with eyes like burning coals, and a body as tautly well-conditioned as her smile was vicious".</ref> laughing an insane and inhuman laughter. In the novel, it is Mileena who scissor-grips Sonya<U+2019>s neck with "her powerful thigh muscles" (the move used on her by Sonya in the film) and she actually introduces herself, adding that she does not appreciate being confused with her "virtuous half-sister." Sonya defeats her by grabbing one of Mileena's own sai and bringing its short-staff down across her windpipe to strangle her to death. Later, when they examine Mileena's corpse, Sonya wonders if Mileena was just "another cyborg" due to the griffon-like tattoo on her shoulder matching the mark that has been on [[Cyrax]].
