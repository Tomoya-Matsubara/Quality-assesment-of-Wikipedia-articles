Route 209 begins at Market Square ([[Pennsylvania Route 147|PA 147]]) in [[Millersburg, Pennsylvania|Millersburg]], a block east of the [[Susquehanna River]]. Known as Union Street, US 209 moves eastward until Union Avenue goes straight at a fork as 209 turns onto State Street. Where the highway traverses the eastern portions of the municipality, [[Pennsylvania Route 25]] intersects it. Outside of Millersburg, 209 follows an east-west alignment, although the road is signed north-south. After turning east for a little while, 209 enters the borough of [[Reservoir Heights, Pennsylvania|Reservoir Heights]]. Leaving the borough, 209 begins a more northeasterly course. In [[Elizabethville, Pennsylvania|Elizabethville]], 209 is signed as Main Street and has an intersection with [[Pennsylvania Route 225]].<ref>{{cite map|publisher=[[Google]]|url=http://www.google.com/maps?q=Millersburg,+PA,+USA&sa=X&oi=map&ct=title|title=Borough of Elizabethville|accessdate=2007-07-03}}</ref> East of the borough, 209 takes a more northernly course while traversing a mountainous region of the state. This section of 209 designates the route between [[Bear Mountain|Bear]] and [[Peters Mountain|Peters Mountains]]. The road also passes south of Spechty Kopf (elv. 1,508 ft.) and [[Weiser State Forest]] near the Dauphin-[[Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Schuylkill]] county line.<ref>{{cite map|publisher=[[Rand McNally]]|title=Motor Carriers' Road Atlas|year=2007|edition=Deluxe|page=89 |section=EM5|accessdate=2007-07-03}}</ref> Northeast of Williams, 209 intersects with State Route 4010 before entering Schuykill County.

As U.S. Route 209 continues through the borough of [[Brodheadsville, Pennsylvania|Brodheadsville]], the road is known as Hamilton West Road, first intersecting with [[Pennsylvania Route 715]].<ref name="Google">[http://maps.google.com/maps?um=1&tab=wl&hl=en&q=US%20209 GoogleMaps - US 209, PA]</ref> After passing some local roads, the Wilkes-Barre Turnpike begins to the right. US 209 then begins to paralell a couple of [[Scotia, Pennsylvania|Scotia]] township roads, TR 221 to the north and TR 216 to the south. 209 then passes its auxillary route, [[U.S. Route 209 Business (Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania)|U.S. Route 209 Business]].<ref name="Google"/> In Scotia, TRs 220 and 218 begin to parallel until the intersection with Monroe County State Route 3023. Soon after crossing 3023, the road turns northand becomes concurrent with [[Pennsylvania Route 33]]. The roads stay concurrent for several miles, intersecting with only one route, State Route 2010 in [[Branerd Center, Pennsylvania|Brandnerd Center]]. 209 then splits off to the east in [[Snydersville, Pennsylvania|Snydersville]].<ref name="Google"/> 209 at this point is now parallel to its auxillary route. Route 209 intersects State Route 2005 at a [[traffic signal]] and passes over SR 2007 before intersecting with its auxillary route once again. Soon after the interchange with US 209 Business, the main US 209 becomes concurrent with [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 80]] in [[Bartonsville, Pennsylvania|Bartonsville]], beginning at Exit 304.<ref name="Google"/>

The first intersection during the concurrency is with its auxillary route at Exit 305, due west of [[Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania|Stroudsburg]].<ref name="Google"/> The next exit going eastward is for [[Pennsylvania Route 611]] in [[East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania|East Stroudsburg]].

[[Pennsylvania Route 402|PA Route 402]] leaves to the left soon after and then leaves the hamlet. For several miles, 209 crosses local roads in several hamlets. The next major intersection on 209 is for State Route 2028, also known as River Road. A couple miles after QR 2028, 209 enters Pike County in the town of [[Bushkill Township, Pennsylvania|Bushkill]]. At this point, you now enter a controlled area of 209 by the [[National Park Service]].<ref name="Google"/> The road enters the [[Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area]] for about 20 miles. In this section of 209, commercial veichles have to pay money to drive on the road.<ref name="209 North of Bushkill">[http://www.nps.gov/dewa/planyourvisit/rt209-vehicle-fees.htm Commercial Vehicle Fees on Rt. 209 PA]</ref> The mile markers are also different in this section, with the first tollbooth being mile marker zero.

=== Bypass of Marshalls Creek ===
{{seealso|Pennsylvania Route 402}}
{{seealso|Smithfield Township, Monroe County,  Pennsylvania}}
The area where 209 intersects [[Pennsylvania Route 402]] has been plauged by traffic issues for over a decade. In [[1990]], studies began to making a bypass of the intersection, which is located in the [[Hamlet|hamlet]] of [[Marshalls Creek, Pennsylvania|Marshalls Creek]] in [[Middle Smithfield Township, Pennsylvania|Middle Smithfield Township]]. The traffic had gotten so bad, the town had considered a bypass for the area. The proposal for a bypass was passed in [[October 2004]] and was going to cost [[USD|$]]70 million.<ref name="bypassnews">[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-7132396.html  
Monroe County, Pa., bypass gets approval] - The Morning Call (Allentown)</ref> The total distance used by the bypass is 3.5 miles and is going to be made out of [[Asphalt|asphalt]]. There will be nine new signalized intersections, seven are on 209, 1 is on 402 and one is on River Road (Monroe 2028). The constructors are expecting that during the six-year project, traffic will remain the same on 209, and no detours of 402 and 209 are planned.<ref name="Bypass-Facts">[http://www.marshallscreekbypass.com/factsheet.cfm Project Fact Sheet] Marshallscreekbypass.com</ref> The first of three phases of construction was completed in the Summer of 2007 and cost $14.2 million. Phase 2, projected to start in Fall of 2007, is proposed to cost $17 million.<ref name="Bypass-Facts"/>
