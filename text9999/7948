The '''Purple line''' of the [[Namma Metro]] is part of the rapid transit rail system for the city of [[Bangalore, India]], some of which is currently being constructed. Once finished, it will consist of 36 stations from [[Whitefield, Bangalore|Whitefield]] to [[Kengeri]].  The line will measure {{convert|40.10|km}} and will be mostly elevated, with some stations underground. Currently only a 6.7&nbsp;km stretch between Baiyyappanahalli and M. G. Road is operational. The line will connect the Eastern and Western areas of Bangalore.

Construction work for Phase I, comprising the Purple and Green Lines, of the Namma Metro project was scheduled to start in 2005 but was delayed by a February 2006 change of government in [[Karnataka]] and continued debate over whether the project was financially feasible and appropriate for the city. Finally, on 25 April 2006 the [[Cabinet of India|Indian Cabinet]] approved the project, which was then budgeted at more than {{INRConvert|54|b}} (Later revised to {{INRConvert|116.09|b}} for Phase I).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1508263.cms|work=Online Edition of The Economic Times|title=Indian cabinet approves the project | date=28 April 2006}} {{Dead link|date=December 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> In 2006, Navayuga Engineering was awarded the contract to construct Reach 1 of the Purple Line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmrc.co.in/pdf/award.pdf|work=Official webpage of B.M.R.C.|title=Award of contract|accessdate=2 October 2011}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> The foundation stone for the Phase I construction was laid by Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]] on 24 June 2006,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pmindia.nic.in/speech/content.asp?id=343|work=PM office website|title=PM lays foundation stone for Metro project}}</ref> and civil construction on Reach I of the line, between [[Mahatma Gandhi Road (Namma Metro)|M.G.
