'''Hurricane Inez''' was a late-season [[tropical cyclone scales|major hurricane]]{{#tag:ref|A major hurricane is a tropical cyclone with [[maximum sustained winds]] of at least 111&nbsp;mph (179&nbsp;km/h), or a Category&nbsp;3 or higher on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir&ndash;Simpson hurricane scale]].<ref name="glo">{{cite web|author=[[National Hurricane Center]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=2010-07-11|title=Glossary of NHC Terms|accessdate=2011-07-23|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110628222802/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml| archivedate= 28 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>|group="nb"}} that affected the [[Caribbean]], [[Bahamas]], [[Florida]], and [[Mexico]], the first such storm on record to affect those areas. It originated from a [[tropical wave]] over Africa, and became a tropical depression by September&nbsp;21. It moved slowly westward, initially failing to intensify much; it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Inez on September&nbsp;24. The storm strengthened into a hurricane and was quickly intensifying when it struck the French [[overseas region]] of [[Guadeloupe]] on September&nbsp;27. Inez severely damaged the island's banana and sugar crops, and thousands of homes were damaged, leaving 10,000&nbsp;people homeless. Damage on Guadeloupe was estimated at $50&nbsp;million,{{#tag:ref|All damage totals are in 1955 [[United States dollar]]s unless otherwise noted.|group="nb"}} and there were 40&nbsp;deaths. After entering the Caribbean, Inez briefly weakened before restrengthening, attaining peak [[maximum sustained winds|sustained winds]] of {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on September&nbsp;28. That day, a [[Hurricane Hunters]] flight reported a gust of {{convert|197|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, which was the highest recorded at the time.

Continuing westward, Inez made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] as a small hurricane on the [[Barahona Province|Barahona Peninsula]] of the [[Dominican Republic]]. There, the storm flooded many rivers and destroyed over 800&nbsp;houses. Nationwide, there were about 100&nbsp;deaths and $12&nbsp;million in damage. After affecting the country, Inez struck southwestern Haiti, where it was considered the worst hurricane since the 1920s. As many as 1,000&nbsp;people were killed, and 60,000&nbsp;people were left homeless. Damage totaled $20.35&nbsp;million in Haiti, prompting the United States government to send aid for the first time in nearly ten years due to previous mishandling of funds. Inez weakened quickly over Hispaniola, although it reintensified into a major hurricane before striking southeastern Cuba on September&nbsp;30. There, 125,000&nbsp;people were forced to evacuate, and there were three deaths and $20&nbsp;million in damage.

The hurricane moved slowly over Cuba for two days before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near the Bahamas. It was expected to continue out to sea, although it stalled and resumed its previous westward path. In the Bahamas, heavy rainfall and high tides caused flooding, which killed five people and left $15.5&nbsp;million in damage. Hurricane-force winds occurred throughout the Florida Keys, where 160&nbsp;homes and 190&nbsp;trailers were damaged. [[Sea spray|Salt spray]] damaged crops in the region, and there was $5&nbsp;million in damage and four deaths. In the [[Straits of Florida]], Inez capsized a boat of [[Cuban exile|Cuban refugee]]s, killing 45&nbsp;people. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, a helicopter crashed after carrying evacuees from an oil rig, killing 11&nbsp;people. The hurricane threatened the northern [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]], and although it remained offshore, Inez produced flooding and caused some power outages. At its final landfall, Inez flooded portions of [[Tamaulipas]] and cut off roads to [[Tampico]]. 84,000&nbsp;people were left homeless, and the hurricane destroyed at least 2,500&nbsp;houses. Damage was estimated at $104&nbsp;million, and there were 74&nbsp;deaths in Mexico.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Inez 1966 track.png}}
The origins of Inez were from a [[tropical wave]] that formed over the [[Sahara]] in central Africa on September&nbsp;15 from the [[monsoon]]. It moved westward in the [[prevailing winds]], exiting the west coast of Africa on September&nbsp;18. The precursor to Inez was a disturbance along the northern portion of the wave,<ref name="nasa">{{cite report|date=May 1972|title=The Development of Hurricane Inez, 1966, as Shown by Satellite Nighttime Radiometric and Daytime Television Coverage|publisher=Goddard Space Flight Center|author=Lewis J.

Tracked by satellites, the system moved to the west-southwest,<ref name="mwr"/> and was officially classified a tropical depression on September&nbsp;21 about halfway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} The system remained weak as it turned toward the west-northwest. A [[Hurricane Hunters]] flight indicated some intensification in the system, prompting the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) to initiate advisories on Tropical Storm Inez, located about {{convert|800|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Martinique]].<ref name="mwr">{{cite journal|title=The hurricane season of 1966|journal=Monthly Weather Review|date=March 1, 1967|accessdate=December 4, 2012|volume=95|issue=3|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1967)095<0131:THSO>2.3.CO;2|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/mwreviews/1966.pdf|author=Sugg, Arnold L|page=133|publisher=United States Environmental Science Services Administration}}</ref> With warm water temperatures, the storm developed a circular area of [[convection (meteorology)|convection]] over the center.<ref name="nasa"/> Inez slowed while curving to the west due to a [[subtropical ridge|ridge]] to the north and quickly intensified,<ref name="mwr"/> reaching hurricane status on September&nbsp;26.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} 

On September&nbsp;27, Inez intensified to reach winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h), making it a Category&nbsp;3 on the [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale|Saffir-Simpson scale]].{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} Later that day, the hurricane moved directly over [[Guadeloupe]]. At the time, Inez was a small cyclone, with hurricane-force winds extending {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the center.<ref name="mwr"/> Subsequent meteorologists labeled the storm as a "micro-hurricane... because of its characteristic small, tight cloud structure and strong maximum surface wind."<ref name="nasa"/> Its structure became disrupted by the island, and the [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]] rose from {{convert|961|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} to {{convert|970|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}, indicative of weakening. However, Inez re-intensified after entering the eastern Caribbean Sea, reaching a minimum pressure of {{convert|927|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} on September&nbsp;28 while south of [[Puerto Rico]]. The Hurricane Hunters reported [[maximum sustained winds|sustained winds]] of {{convert|197|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at a height of {{convert|8000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, which was the highest recorded at the time. The same flight estimated surface winds between {{convert|150|to|175|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} near the center.<ref name="mwr"/> The peak intensity listed in the [[HURDAT|Atlantic hurricane database]] is {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, making Inez a strong [[List of Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 4]] hurricane.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

[[File:Hurricane Inez in GOM.png|right|thumb|Hurricane Inez near Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]]
While near peak intensity, Inez was located about {{convert|160|mi|km|abbr=on}} southwest of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], and the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] was tracked by radar from the island. Its increasing [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] caused [[1966 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm Judith|Tropical Storm Judith]] to the east to dissipate. On September&nbsp;29, the small but powerful hurricane made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on the [[Barahona Province|Barahona Peninsula]], and quickly weakened over land. It briefly moved offshore and struck the [[Tiburon Peninsula, Haiti|southern peninsula]] of [[Haiti]] near [[Jacmel]]. The eye emerged into the [[Windward Passage]] near [[L<U+00E9>og<U+00E2>ne]], although severely weakened; the pressure rose to {{convert|987|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}},<ref name="mwr"/> and the winds decreased to 90&nbsp;mph (150&nbsp;km/h) over land. However, Inez quickly re-intensified over water, reaching winds of 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h) on September&nbsp;30 before striking southeastern Cuba near [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay]].{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} When Inez was over Cuba, forecasters had difficulty in predicting the storm's future, and due to a weakness in the ridge to the north, it was expected that the hurricane would move to the north off the east coast of the United States. The hurricane drifted to the west-northwest due to weak steering currents, weakening over the high terrain but later moving offshore the southern coast of Cuba. While over water, the eye reorganized, and the storm maintained hurricane intensity. Inez eventually turned to a northward drift over central Cuba and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on October&nbsp;2.<ref name="mwr"/>

Shortly after exiting Cuba into the Atlantic, Inez weakened into a tropical storm, and was moving northeastward through the [[Bahamas]] about 24&nbsp;hours later than forecast.<ref name="mwr"/> At the time, the storm was expected to continue to the northeast around the [[Bermuda high]].<ref name="nasa"/> With little outflow and a large, diffuse circulation, Inez did not re-intensify much despite otherwise favorable conditions,<ref name="mwr"/> potentially due to a nearby [[trough (meteorology)|trough]].<ref name="nasa"/> The movement slowed, and the 1966 hurricane summary remarked that "Inez probably became nearly stationary closer to the United States mainland than any other storm." On October&nbsp;3, Inez turned to the west-southwest due to a strengthening ridge over the western Gulf of Mexico. Over the subsequent few days, the eye moved directly over the [[Florida Keys]] from [[Key Largo, Florida|Key Largo]] to [[Key West, Florida|Key West]] and continued through the Gulf of Mexico while slowly intensifying. On October&nbsp;7, Inez brushed the northern coast of the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]] with hurricane force winds. Subsequently, the ridge weakened, allowing the hurricane to turn more to the west-northwest.<ref name="mwr"/> On October&nbsp;8, Inez attained a secondary peak intensity of 140&nbsp;mph (220&nbsp;km/h),{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} and a pressure of {{convert|948|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}. Briefly threatening the coastline of Texas, Inez turned turned to the southwest after the ridge again strengthened. On October&nbsp;10, the hurricane made its final landfall near [[Tampico, Tamaulipas]] in northeastern Mexico. It rapidly weakened over land, dissipating on October&nbsp;11.<ref name="mwr"/>

The unusual track of Inez marked the first time on record that a tropical cyclone affected the [[Lesser Antilles|Lesser]] and [[Greater Antilles]], [[Bahamas]], [[Florida]], and [[Mexico]].<ref name="mwr"/> The [[Associated Press]] described Inez as the "first to strike the Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula in many years."<ref name="lewis"/> It was also the first to move across the Gulf of Mexico without turning to the north so late in the season, and the 65&nbsp;advisories issued by the NHC was the highest at the time. The path taken by Inez was compared to [[Hurricane Betsy]] in 1965, which also slowed and moved erratically due to a ridge.<ref name="mwr"/> Forecasters had difficulty with the hurricane due to the unusual path, as well as the inability to fly the Hurricane Hunters into Inez while it was over Cuba.<ref>{{cite news|author=Ben Funk|agency=Associated Press|date=1967-05-24|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard|title=Hurricane Pilots Await Castro's OK|accessdate=2013-02-22|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-adVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3-ADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6623,5099859&dq=hurricane+inez+1966&hl=en}}</ref>

==Impact==
[[Image:Hurricane Inez near peak.png|right|thumb|Satellite image of Inez near peak intensity in the Caribbean]]
Overall, Hurricane Inez killed about 1,000&nbsp;people, mostly on Hispaniola, and caused over $200&nbsp;million in damage. Crop damage was less than other storms of similar magnitude, due to Inez's small size and its occurrence late in the season.<ref name="mwr"/>
