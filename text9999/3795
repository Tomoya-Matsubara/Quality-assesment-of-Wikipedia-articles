'''Hamad Al Fardan''' (born June 29, 1987 in [[Manama]]) is an [[Bahrain]]i racing driver. He is the first Bahraini to drive at [[GP2 Series]] level.

==Career==
===Formula BMW===
Al Fardan is the son of [[Rallying|rally]] driver [[Ahmed Al Fardan]].<ref name="F1tip">{{cite news| title =Arabian ace tipped for F1 future| publisher =crash.net| url =http://www.crash.net/motorsport/f1/news/159396-0/arabian_ace_tipped_for_f1_future.html| date =2008-02-07| accessdate =2008-09-26}}</ref> His first experience of [[formula racing]] came in 2004, when he drove in the [[Formula BMW Asia]] series. In 2005, he undertook a full season in the championship with the [[Malaysia]]n team [[Team Meritus|Meritus]] and finished third overall.  He also raced in the [[Formula BMW World Final]], finishing in eighteenth position. For 2006, he returned to the series for two races only due to commitments in other championships, winning both of them.

===Formula Renault===
Al Fardan competed in the [[Formula V6 Asia|Formula Asia V6 Renault]] championship in [[2006 Formula V6 Asia by Renault season|2006]], finishing the championship in sixth place with one win despite missing the last four races of the season. He again raced for the Meritus team.

===Toyota Racing Series===
Al Fardan also drove in the [[New Zealand]]-based [[Toyota Racing Series]] for 2006, again employed by Meritus. Scoring one race victory, he finished thirteenth in the championship. He remained in the formula for 2007, although he switched teams to [[Mark Petch Motorsport]]. In this year he won two races and moved up to eleventh place in the championship. It was a hectic season for Al Fardan, as he also competed in [[British Formula Three Championship|British Formula Three]] on the other side of the world.

===Formula Three===
Al Fardan moved to the National Class of the [[British Formula Three Championship]] for [[2007 British Formula Three season|2007]] (in addition to his TRS commitments), where he established himself as a frontrunner in the series.<ref>{{cite news| title =Al Fardan out to end on a high| publisher =crash.net| url =http://www.crash.net/motorsport/f3/news/154997-0/al_fardan_out_to_end_on_a_high.html| date = 2007-09-27| accessdate =2008-09-26}}</ref> He finished third in the championship for the [[Performance Racing]] team, despite not winning a race.

Over the winter of 2007-08, he moved to the [[Asian Formula Three Championship]], driving for a national team sponsored by the Arabian bank [[Gulf House Finance]]. He won both rounds of the season-opener at the [[Sepang International Circuit|Sepang]] circuit in Malaysia,<ref>{{cite news| title =Al Fardan takes Asian F3 opener| publisher =crash.net| url =http://www.crash.net/motorsport/f3/news/157537-0/al_fardan_takes_asian_f3_opener.html| date = 2007-11-24| accessdate =2008-09-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title =Al Fardan doubles up in Asia| publisher =crash.net| url =http://www.crash.net/motorsport/f3/news/157627-0/al_fardan_doubles_up_in_asia.html| date =2007-11-26| accessdate =2008-09-26}}</ref> and two further races, but then accused the team of fastest man, [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Vervisch]], of cheating. He declined to make a protest preferring to walk away.<ref>http://www.asianf3.net/article/articleview/959/1/8/ Al Fardan withdraws from Asian F3</ref> He finished fourth in the championship. Following his performance in 2007, [[Toyota F1]] test driver [[Kamui Kobayashi]] tipped him to become the first [[Middle East]]ern driver to make it to [[Formula One]].<ref name="F1tip"/>

Al Fardan moved to the [[Germany|German]] [[German Formula Three Championship|ATS Formel 3 Cup]] for 2008, where he was placed eleventh in the final standings, although his season was disrupted by injury.<ref>{{cite news| title =Kart Zone now open following gripping exhibition race| publisher =bahraingp.com.bh| url =http://www.bahraingp.com.bh/news.read.aspx?id=316| date = 2008-09-08| accessdate =2008-09-26}}</ref>

===GP2 Series===
Al Fardan has signed for the [[iSport International]] team to compete in the [[2008-09 GP2 Asia Series season]], becoming the first Bahraini and [[Arab]]ian driver to race at this level. His backing from Gulf Finance House also means that the team will change its name to GFH Team iSport for the duration of the series.<ref>{{cite news| title =iSport announces Asia Series sponsor, driver| publisher =crash.net| url =http://www.crash.net/motorsport/gp2/news/167501-0/isport_announces_asia_series_sponsor_driver.html| date = 2008-08-11| accessdate =2008-09-26}}</ref> He ended up 20th in the championship, scoring two points.
