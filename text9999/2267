The '''French ironclad ''Montcalm''''' was a wooden-hulled armored [[corvette]] built for the [[French Navy]] in the mid-1860s. She was named after [[Major General]] [[Louis de Montcalm de Saint V<U+00E9>ran|Montcalm]] who lost the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] in 1759. She played a minor role in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870 where she captured one Prussian sailing ship. ''Montcalm'' spent most of her later career abroad, either in Chinese waters or the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The ship was condemned in 1891.

==Design and description==
The {{sclass|Alma|ironclad}}s were designed as a improved version of the {{ship|French ironclad|Belliqueuse}} suitable for foreign deployments. Unlike their predecessor the ''Alma''-class ships were true [[Central battery ship|central battery ironclads]] as they were fitted with armored transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s.<ref name=d26>de Balincourt and Vincent-Br<U+00E9>chignac 1976, p. 26</ref> Like most ironclads of their era they were equipped with a metal-reinforced [[Naval ram|ram]].<ref name=g1>Gardiner, p. 302</ref>

''Montcalm'' measured {{convert|68.75|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[Length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|14.13|m|ftin|sp=us}}. She had a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|6.66|m|ftin|sp=us}} and displaced {{convert|3889|t|LT|lk=on|sp=us}}.<ref name=d26/> Her crew numbered 316 officers and men.<ref name=g1/>

===Propulsion===
The ship had a single horizontal [[Marine steam engine#Back acting|return connecting-rod steam engine]] driving a single propeller. Her engine was powered by four oval [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s.<ref name=g1/> On [[sea trial]]s the engine produced {{convert|1830|ihp}} and the ship reached {{convert|11.65|kn}}.<ref name=d26/> ''Montcalm'' carried {{convert|250|MT|LT}}<ref name=g1/> of coal which allowed the ship to steam for {{convert|1460|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. She was [[barque]]-rigged and had a sail area of {{convert|1438|sqm|sqft}}.<ref name=d26/>

===Armament===
''Montcalm'' mounted her four {{convert|194|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} Mod<U+00E8>le 1864 guns in the central battery on the battery deck. The other two 194-millimeter guns were mounted in [[barbettes]] on the upper deck, [[sponson]]ed out over the sides of the ship. The four {{convert|120|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} guns were also mounted on the upper deck.<ref name=d27/>

===Armor===
''Montcalm'' had a complete {{convert|150|mm|in|sp=us|1|adj=on}} [[wrought iron]] waterline [[Belt armor|belt]], approximately {{convert|2.4|m|ft|sp=us|1}} high. The sides of the battery itself were armored with {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us|1}} of wrought iron and the ends of the battery were closed by bulkheads of the same thickness. The barbette armor was {{convert|100|mm|in|sp=us}} thick, backed by {{convert|240|mm|in|sp=us}} of wood.<ref name=d27>de Balincourt and Vincent-Br<U+00E9>chignac 1976, p. 27</ref> The unarmored portions of her sides were protected by {{convert|15|mm|in|adj=on|1|sp=us}} iron plates.<ref name=g1/>

==Service==
''Montcalm'' was laid down at [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] on 26 October 1865 and launched on 16 October 1868. The ship began her [[sea trial]]s on 16 June 1869 and was then sent to the Mediterranean until May 1870. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]], she captured the German [[barque]] ''Union'' in the Atlantic and watched the {{ship|Prussian corvette|Arcona}} in Portuguese waters.<ref name=d30/> She cruised the North and South Atlantic before being put in reserve on 1 August 1871 at [[Cherbourg]]. Recommissioned on 20 October 1873, she sailed for China on 5 January 1874 to relieve the armored corvette {{ship|French ironclad|Belliqueuse||2}} as [[flagship]] of the China Station. ''Montcalm'' arrived back in Cherbourg on 20 May 1876 and was reduced to reserve from 1878 to 1880. In 1882, she became flagship for the Pacific division under command of Rear Admiral Landolfe. Back to Cherbourg in 1884, she remained there until 2 April 1891 when she was condemned.<ref name=d30>de Balincourt and Vincent-Br<U+00E9>chignac 1976, p. 30</ref>
