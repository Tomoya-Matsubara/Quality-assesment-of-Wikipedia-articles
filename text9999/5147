{{About|the ice hockey match|the episode of [[The Penguins of Madagascar]]|Miracle On Ice (The Penguins of Madagascar episode)}}
The "'''Miracle on Ice'''" was a medal-round men's [[ice hockey]] game during the [[1980 Winter Olympics]] at [[Lake Placid, New York]], on February 22. The [[United States men's national ice hockey team|United States team]], made up of [[amateur]] and [[college sports|collegiate]] players and led by coach [[Herb Brooks]], defeated the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet team]], which was considered the best hockey team in the world.

[[United States men's national ice hockey team|Team USA]] went on to [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|win the gold medal]] by winning their final match over [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]], who finished 2nd. The Soviet Union took the bronze medal by beating [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] in their final game. As part of its 100th anniversary celebrations in 2008, the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) chose the Miracle on Ice as the number-one international hockey story of the century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/channels/iihf-world-championship/top-story-of-the-century.html|title=Top Story of the Century|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2010-04-04}}</ref> 

== History ==
===The Soviet and American teams===
The Soviet Union entered the Olympic tournament as heavy favorites, having won the ice hockey gold medal in [[Ice hockey at the 1956 Winter Olympics|1956]] and every year since [[Ice hockey at the 1964 Winter Olympics|1964]]. In the four Olympics after the Soviet squad was [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|upset by Team USA]] at Squaw Valley in [[1960 Winter Olympics|1960]], Soviet teams had gone 27-1-1 and outscored the opposition 175-44.<ref>Coffey, p. 35</ref> In head-to-head matchups against the United States the cumulative score over that period was 28-7.<ref>Coffey, p. 17</ref> The Soviet players were classed as amateurs, but soft jobs provided by the [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]] government (some were active-duty military)<ref>Coffey, p. 59</ref> allowed them to essentially play professionally in a well-developed league with world class training facilities. They were led by legendary players in world ice hockey, such as [[Boris Mikhailov (ice hockey)|Boris Mikhailov]] (a top line [[Winger (ice hockey)|right winger]] and team captain), [[Vladislav Tretiak]] (considered by many to be the best ice hockey goaltender in the world at the time), the speedy and skilled [[Valeri Kharlamov]], as well as talented, young, and dynamic players such as defenseman [[Viacheslav Fetisov]] and forwards [[Vladimir Krutov]] and [[Sergei Makarov]]. From that team, Tretiak, Kharlamov, and Fetisov would eventually be enshrined in the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]].

Herb Brooks conducted tryouts in [[Colorado Springs]] in the summer of 1979. Of the 20 players who eventually made the final Olympic roster, [[Buzz Schneider]] was the only one left over from the 1976 Olympic team.<ref>Coffey, pp. 19-20</ref> Nine players had played under Herb Brooks at the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey|University of Minnesota]]. Four more were from [[Boston Terriers men's ice hockey|Boston University]].<ref>Coffey, p. 21</ref> Assistant coach [[Craig Patrick]] had played with Brooks on the 1967 U.S. national team.<ref>Coffey, p. 25</ref> 

The Soviet and American teams were natural rivals due to the decades-old [[Cold War]]. In addition, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] was at the time considering a [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S. boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]], to be held in [[Moscow]], in protest of the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], which had begun just weeks before. On February 9, the same day that the American and Soviet teams met in an exhibition in New York City, U.S. Secretary of State [[Cyrus Vance]] denounced the impending [[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow games]] at a meeting of the IOC.<ref>Coffey, pp. 159-160</ref> President Carter eventually decided in favor of the boycott.

===Exhibitions===
In exhibitions that year, Soviet club teams had gone 5<U+2013>3<U+2013>1 against [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) teams, and a year earlier the Soviet national team had routed the NHL All-Stars 6<U+2013>0 to win the [[1979 Challenge Cup|Challenge Cup]].<ref name=espn>[http://espn.go.com/classic/s/miracle_ice_1980.html "College kids perform Olympic miracle"], ESPN.com</ref> In 1979<U+2013>80, virtually all the top North American players were Canadians, although the number of U.S.-born professional players had been on the rise throughout the 1970s. The 1980 U.S. Olympic team featured several young players who were regarded as highly promising, and some had signed contracts to play in the NHL immediately after the tournament.

In September the American team started exhibition play, playing 61 games in five months against teams from Europe and America.<ref>Coffey, p. 26</ref> The last exhibition game was against the Soviets in [[Madison Square Garden]] on February 9, 1980. The Soviets crushed the Americans 10-3.<ref>Coffey, pp. 46-48</ref> Viktor Tikhonov later said that this victory "turned out to be a very big problem" by causing the Soviets to underestimate the American team.<ref>Coffey, p. 51</ref>

===Olympic group play===
In Olympic group play, the United States surprised many observers with their physical, cohesive play. In their first game against favored [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]], Team USA earned a dramatic 2<U+2013>2 draw by scoring with 27 seconds left after pulling goalie [[Jim Craig (ice hockey)|Jim Craig]] for an extra attacker. Then came a stunning 7<U+2013>3 victory over [[Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], considered by many to be the second-best team after the Soviet Union and a favorite for the silver medal. With their two toughest games in the group phase out of the way, the U.S. team reeled off three more wins, beating [[Norway men's national ice hockey team|Norway]] 5<U+2013>1, [[Romania men's national ice hockey team|Romania]] 7<U+2013>2, and [[West Germany national ice hockey team|West Germany]] 4<U+2013>2 to go 4<U+2013>0<U+2013>1 and advance to the medal round from their group, along with the Swedes.

In the other group, the Soviets stormed through their opposition undefeated, often by grossly lopsided scores&nbsp;<U+2013> knocking off [[Japan men's national ice hockey team|Japan]] 16<U+2013>0, the [[Netherlands men's national ice hockey team|Netherlands]] 17<U+2013>4, [[Poland men's national ice hockey team|Poland]] 8<U+2013>1, [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]] 4<U+2013>2, and [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]] 6<U+2013>4; easily qualifying for the next round, although both the Finns and the Canadians gave the Soviets tough games for two periods. In the end, the Soviet Union and Finland (who overcame a disastrous start after sensationally losing to Poland in their opening game of the tournament, but then rallied to upset Canada) advanced from their group.<ref name=boxscore>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1980/orw1980v2.pdf PDF file with <U+00AB>Official results of the XIII Olympic Winter Games <U+2014> Lake Placid 1980<U+00BB>]</ref><!-- See this PDF file for all official game information, including won-loss records, game outcomes, information on qualifying and advancing, etc. -->

===Preparing for the medal round===
The U.S. and Soviet teams prepared for the medal round in different ways. Soviet coach [[Viktor Tikhonov]] rested most of his best players, preferring to let them study plays rather than actually skate. U.S. coach [[Herb Brooks]], however, continued with his tough, confrontational style, skating "hard" practices and berating his players for perceived weaknesses.

The day before the match, columnist [[Dave Anderson (sportswriter)|Dave Anderson]] wrote in the ''[[New York Times]]'', "Unless the ice melts, or unless the United States team or another team performs a [[miracle]], as did the American squad in [[1960 Winter Olympics|1960]], the Russians are expected to easily win the Olympic gold medal for the sixth time in the last seven tournaments."<ref>{{cite web |last=Kuzmiak|first=Eric|publisher=Bleacher Report|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/28926-open-mic-greatest-sports-achievements-do-you-believe-in-miracles|title=Open-Mic: Greatest Sports Achievements - Do You Believe in Miracles?|date=June 11, 2008|accessdate=2008-08-14}}</ref>

== "Do you believe in miracles?" ==
The Field House (capacity 8500) was packed.<ref>Coffey, p. 68</ref> The home crowd waved [[Flag of the United States|American flags]] and sang patriotic songs such as "[[God Bless America]]."<ref name=espn/> The rest of the United States (except those who watched the game live on Canadian television) had to wait to see the game. After the Soviets refused to consent to moving the game from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. for American television (this would have meant a 4 a.m. start in Moscow for Soviet viewers), [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]] decided to broadcast the late-afternoon game on tape delay in prime time.<ref>Coffey, p.82</ref> Before the game, Brooks read his players a statement he'd written out on a piece of paper, telling them that "You were born to be a player. You were meant to be here. This moment is yours."<ref>Coffey, p. 45</ref>

===First period===
As in several previous games, the U.S. team fell behind early. Vladimir Krutov deflected a slap shot by [[Aleksei Kasatonov]] past U.S. netminder Jim Craig to give the Soviets a 1<U+2013>0 lead, and after [[Buzz Schneider]] scored for the United States to tie the game, the Soviets struck again with a Sergei Makarov goal. Down 2<U+2013>1, Craig improved his play, turning away many Soviet shots before the U.S. team had another shot on goal (the Soviet team had 39 shots on goal in the game, the Americans 16).

In the waning seconds of the first period, [[Dave Christian]] fired a slap shot on Tretiak from 100 feet away. The Soviet goalie saved the shot but misplayed the [[Rebound (sports)|rebound]], which bounced out some 20 feet in front of him. The Soviet defensemen, Pervukhin and Bilyaletdinov, quit playing and watched the clock tick off the last few seconds. Tretiak started to move out of goal. [[Mark Johnson (hockey player)|Mark Johnson]] sliced between the two defensemen, found the loose puck and fired it past a diving Tretiak to tie the score with one second left in the period.<ref>Coffey, pp. 123-126</ref> The Soviet team played the final second of the period with just three players on the ice, as the rest of the team had retired to their dressing room for the first intermission. The first period ended with the game tied 2-2.<ref name=swift>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/the_golden_goal/ "The Golden Goal"], E.M. Swift, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', March 3, 1980. Accessed 2010-04-04</ref>

===Second period===
Tikhonov replaced Tretiak with backup goaltender [[Vladimir Myshkin]] immediately after Johnson's tying goal,<ref>Coffey, p. 150</ref> a move which shocked players on both teams.<ref name=espn/> Fetisov later identified this as the "turning point of the game."<ref>[http://proicehockey.about.com/cs/history/a/miracle_on_ice_2.htm The Miracle Unfolds]</ref> Later Tikhonov called the decision "the biggest mistake of my career".<ref>Coffey, p. 152</ref> Myshkin allowed no goals in the second period. The Soviets dominated play in the second period, outshooting the Americans 12-2, but scored only once, on a power play goal by [[Aleksandr Maltsev]]. After two periods the Soviet Union led 3-2.

===Third period===
Vladimir Krutov was sent to the penalty box at the 6:47 mark of the third period for high-sticking. The Americans, who had managed only two shots on Myshkin in 27 minutes, had a power play and a rare offensive opportunity. Myshkin stopped a Ramsey shot, then Eruzione fired a shot wide. Late in the power play, Dave Silk was advancing into the Soviet zone when Vasilev knocked him to the ice. The puck slid to Mark Johnson.<ref>Coffey, pp. 350-352</ref> Johnson fired off a shot that went under Myshkin and into the net at the 8:39 mark, as the power play was ending, tying the game 3-3.<ref>Coffey, p. 358</ref> Only a couple shifts later, [[Mark Pavelich]] passed to U.S. captain [[Mike Eruzione]], who was left undefended in the high [[Slot (ice hockey)|slot]]. Eruzione, who had just come into the game, fired a shot past Myshkin, who was [[Screen (ice hockey)|screened]] by Pervukhin.<ref>Coffey, p. 374</ref> This goal gave Team USA a 4<U+2013>3 lead, its first of the game, with exactly 10 minutes left.

The Soviets attacked furiously. Moments after Eruzione's goal, Maltzev fired off a shot which ricocheted off the right goal post.<ref>Coffey, p. 377</ref> As the minutes wound down, Brooks kept repeating "Play your game. Play your game."<ref>Coffey, p. 379</ref> Instead of going into a defensive crouch, the United States continued to play offense, even getting off a few more shots on goal.<ref>Coffey, p. 381</ref> The Soviets began to shoot wildly, and Starikov admitted that "we were panicking." As the clock ticked down below a minute the Soviets got the puck back into the American zone, and Mikhailov passed to Petrov, who shot wide.<ref>Coffey, p. 383</ref> The Soviets never pulled Myshkin for an [[extra attacker]], much to the disbelief of the Americans. Starikov later explained that "We never did six-on-five", not even in practice, because "Tikhonov just didn't believe in it."<ref name="Coffey, p. 384">Coffey, p. 384</ref> Craig kicked away a Petrov slap shot with 33 seconds left. Kharlamov fired the puck back in as the clock ticked below 20 seconds. A wild scramble for the puck ensued, ending when Johnson found it and passed to Morrow.<ref name="Coffey, p. 384"/> As the U.S. team tried to clear the zone (move the puck over the blue line, which they did with seven seconds remaining), the crowd began to count down the seconds left. Sportscaster [[Al Michaels]], who was calling the game on [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]] along with former [[Montreal Canadiens]] goalie [[Ken Dryden]], picked up on the countdown in his broadcast, and delivered his famous call:<ref>''Do You Believe in Miracles?'', HBO Films documentary, 2001</ref>

{{cquote|Eleven seconds, you've got ten seconds, the countdown going on right now! [[Ken Morrow|Morrow]], up to [[Dave Silk|Silk]]. Five seconds left in the game. Do you believe in miracles?...YES!}}

The United States did not win the gold medal upon defeating the USSR. In 1980 the medal round was a round-robin, not a single elimination format as it is today. Under Olympic rules at the time, the group game with Sweden was counted along with the medal round games versus the Soviet Union and Finland so it was mathematically possible for the United States to finish anywhere from first to fourth.<ref>{{cite news|last=Swift|first=E.M|date=March 3, 1980|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/the_golden_goal/|title=The Golden Goal|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]}}</ref>

Needing to win to secure the gold medal, Team USA came back from a 2-1 third period deficit to defeat Finland 4<U+2013>2.<ref name=boxscore/> According to Mike Eruzione, coming into the dressing room in the second intermission, Brooks turned to his players, looked at them and said, "If you lose this game, you'll take it to your graves." He then paused, took a few steps, turned again, said, "Your fucking graves," and walked out.{{Cite quote|date=March 2010}}

At the time, the players ascended a podium to receive their medals and then lined up on the ice for the playing of the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]], as the podium was only meant to accommodate one person. Only the team captains remained on the podium for the duration. After the completion of the anthem, Eruzione motioned for his teammates to join him on the podium.<ref>Coffey, pp. 412-413</ref> Today, the podiums are large enough to accommodate all of the players.

The victory bolstered many American citizens'{{Who|date=March 2010}} feelings of national pride, which had been severely strained during the turbulent 1970s. The match against the Soviets popularized the [[U-S-A! cheer|"U-S-A! U-S-A!" chant]],<ref>{{cite web |title=The Third Stage of American Empire |author=Pitt, William Rivers |authorlink=William Rivers Pitt |date=March 1, 2005 |publisher=[[truthout.org]] |url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/154/25728.html}}</ref> which has been used by American supporters at many international sports competitions since 1980.

===Later careers===
Of the 20 players of Team USA, 13 eventually played in the NHL.<ref>Coffey, p. 318</ref> Five of them went on to play over 500 NHL games, and three would play over 1,000 NHL games.

* [[Neal Broten]] appeared in 1,099 NHL games over 17 seasons, mostly with the [[Minnesota North Stars]]/[[Dallas Stars]] franchise. A two-time All-Star, he tallied 923 career points (289 goals, 634 assists), became the first American player to record 100 points in a season, and won a [[Stanley Cup]] as a member of the [[New Jersey Devils]] in [[1994<U+2013>95 NHL season|1995]].<ref>[http://www.hockey-reference.com/players/b/brotene01.html Neal Broten page] at Hockey Reference</ref> Broten had already won the [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship|NCAA championship]] in 1979 at the [[University of Minnesota]]; this, combined with the Olympic gold medal in 1980 and the 1995 Cup win (Broten scored the Cup winning goal in Game 4 as [[Viacheslav Fetisov]], an opponent on the Soviet squad but by then a teammate of Mike Ramsay, fell down), made him the only player in the history of the sport to win a championship at the collegiate, professional, and Olympic levels.
* [[Ken Morrow]] won a Stanley Cup in [[1980 Stanley Cup Finals|1980]] as a member of the [[New York Islanders]], becoming the first hockey player to win an Olympic gold medal and the Cup in the same year.<ref>Coffey, p. 200</ref> He went on to play 550 NHL games and win three more Cups, all with the Islanders.<ref>[http://www.hockey-reference.com/players/m/morroke01.html Ken Morrow page] at Hockey Reference</ref>
* [[Mike Ramsey (ice hockey)|Mike Ramsey]] played in 1,070 games over 18 years. Fourteen of those years were spent with the [[Buffalo Sabres]], for whom he was a five-time All-Star and served as team captain from 1990<U+2013>92. In 1995, he played in the [[1995 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] while with the [[Detroit Red Wings]], but got swept by the New Jersey Devils, whom Broten was a member of. Interestingly, Soviet defenseman [[Viacheslav Fetisov]] of the 1980 squad, had been one of Ramsey's teammates in Detroit. In 2000 he became an assistant coach for the [[Minnesota Wild]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php3?pid=4450|title=Mike Ramsey|publisher=Hockeydb.com|accessdate=2008-05-23}}</ref>

In 2002 Johnson became the coach of the [[University of Wisconsin<U+2013>Madison]] Women's Hockey team, leading the team to consecutive [[NCAA Women's Ice Hockey Championship|National Championships]] in the 2006 and 2007 seasons and a third in 2009. Johnson was head coach of the women's hockey team that won the silver medal at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]].

== Soviet aftermath ==
In the Soviet locker room Tikhonov singled out first-line players Tretiak, Kharlamov, Petrov, and Mikhailov, and told each of them, "This is your loss!"<ref>Coffey, p. 389</ref> Two days after the Miracle on Ice, the Soviet team crushed Sweden 9-2, winning the silver medal. The Soviet players were so upset at their loss that they did not turn in their silver medals to get their names inscribed on them, as is custom.<ref name=Coffey413>Coffey, p. 413</ref>

The result stunned the Soviet Union and its news media. The day after the loss, the [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] news offices at Lake Placid's International Broadcast Center were closed, with a handwritten note taped to the door of the office stating "Today Closed We Are." ''[[Pravda]]'' did not mention the game, either in its next daily issue or in its Lake Placid wrapup.<ref name=Coffey413/>

Despite the loss, the USSR remained the pre-eminent power in Olympic hockey until the country's 1991 break-up. The Soviets did not lose another international hockey game until 1985 and did not lose to the United States again until 1991.<ref>Coffey, p. 396-7</ref> Throughout the 1980s, NHL teams continued to draft Soviet players in hopes of enticing them to eventually play professionally in North America, but the first did not do so until the [[1988<U+2013>89 NHL season]], when veteran [[Sergei Pryakhin]] joined the [[Calgary Flames]].<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/news/2002/09/27/soviet_legacy/ "Sweeping changes: Russian hockey looked different after '72 Summit Series"], SI.com, September 27, 2002.

In the [[1989<U+2013>90 NHL season]], other 1980 Olympians joined the NHL, including [[Vyacheslav Fetisov]], [[Alexei Kasatonov]], [[Vladimir Krutov]], [[Helmut Balderis]] and [[Sergei Makarov]]. Fetisov, as noted above, was a teammate of Mike Ramsey on the [[1994<U+2013>95 Detroit Red Wings season|1995 Detroit Red Wings team]] that lost the Stanley Cup final.  Fetisov completed his career by winning Cups with the Red Wings in [[1996<U+2013>97 Detroit Red Wings season|1997]] and [[1997<U+2013>98 Detroit Red Wings season|1998]].<ref>[http://www.hockey-reference.com/players/f/fetisvi01.html Viacheslav Fetisov page at Hockey Reference]</ref>  Makarov won the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] (NHL Rookie of the Year) in 1990, becoming the oldest player to win that award.<ref>[http://www.hockey-reference.com/players/m/makarse01.html Sergei Makarov at Hockey Reference]</ref>  That same 1989-90 season, younger Soviet stars [[Alexander Mogilny]] and [[Sergei Fedorov]] defected to play for the Buffalo Sabres and the Detroit Red Wings, respectively. Soon thereafter, the collapse of the Soviet Union led to a flood of ex-Soviet stars in the NHL like Igor Larionov and Vladimir Konstantinov; since then, many of the NHL's top players have come from the former Soviet republics.

== Film and television adaptations ==
A movie, ''[[Miracle on Ice (1981 film)|Miracle on Ice]]'', starring [[Karl Malden]] as Brooks and [[Steve Guttenberg]] as Craig, aired on television in 1981.<ref>{{imdb-title|0082754}} Accessed 2008-05-03</ref> It incorporates actual game footage and original commentary from the 1980 Winter Games.

A second movie called ''[[Miracle (film)|Miracle]]'', starring [[Kurt Russell]] as Brooks, was released in 2004. [[Al Michaels]] recreated his commentary for most of the games. The final ten seconds, however, and his "Do you believe in miracles? YES!" call, were from the original broadcast and used in the film since the filmmakers felt that they could not ask him to recreate the emotion he felt at that moment.  The film was dedicated to Herb Brooks.

The documentary film ''Do You Believe in Miracles?'', narrated by [[Liev Schreiber]], appeared on [[HBO]] in 2001.<ref>{{imdb-title|0276918}} Accessed 2008-05-23</ref>
