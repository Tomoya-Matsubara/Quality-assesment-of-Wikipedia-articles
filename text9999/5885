The '''blanket sleeper''', also known as '''footed pajamas''', '''Dr. Dentons''', and many [[#Terminology|other synonyms]], is a type of especially warm [[nightwear|sleeping garment]] worn primarily during the [[winter]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].  The garment is worn especially by [[infant]]s and young [[child|children]].

Typically, but not always, the blanket sleeper consists of a loose-fitting, one-piece garment of [[blanket]]-like material, enclosing the entire body except for the head and hands. It represents an intermediate step between regular [[pajamas]], and bag-like coverings for infants such as buntings or infant [[sleeping bag (infant)|sleeping bags]]:  Like bag-like coverings, the blanket sleeper is designed to be sufficiently warm as to make regular blankets or other [[bedding|bed covers]] unnecessary, even in colder weather.  Unlike such coverings, the blanket sleeper has [[bifurcation|bifurcated]] legs to allow unhindered [[walking]] (or [[crawling]]).

While no single feature is universal (see the [[#Terminology|Terminology]] and [[#Variations|Variations]] sections below), features distinguishing a blanket sleeper from regular pajamas usually include:

* One-piece construction with long [[sleeve]]s and legs.
* Attached [[bootee]]s enclosing the wearer's [[foot|feet]].
* Composition from relatively thick, heavy [[textile|fabric]].

Although any sleeping garment with some or all of these characteristics could be called a ''blanket sleeper'', the term is most commonly applied to a range of styles that deviate relatively little from the same basic design.  (The features of this design are described in the ''[[#Features|Features]]'' section, below.)

Although widely thought of as something worn only by the very young, blanket sleepers are also sometimes worn (in decreasing order of frequency) by school-age children, teens, and even adults.  (See ''[[#Sizes, gender differences, and availability|Sizes, gender differences, and availability]]'',
below.)

Although footed, one-piece garments in a variety of fabrics and styles are used in many countries as infant sleepwear, the specific range of styles with which the term ''blanket sleeper'' is usually associated, the term itself, and the phenomenon of children older than infancy wearing footed, one-piece sleeping garments, are all largely unique to [[North America]].

== Features ==

Features of the typical blanket sleeper include:

* Composition from a [[nap|napped]] [[synthetic fiber|synthetic]] fabric, such as [[polyester]] [[polar fleece]].

* Loose fit.  On smaller sizes, the hip area may be made especially loose to accommodate a [[diaper]].  The crotch is usually cut especially low.

* [[raglan sleeve|Raglan sleeves]].

* Snug [[Ribbing (knitting)|rib-knit]] [[collar (clothing)|collar]] and wrist [[cuff]]s.

* Usually made in one or more solid, bright colors, or [[screen-printing|screen-printed]] with graphic designs.  There may be a front panel with a single, elaborate printed design, either covering the chest, or forming the entire front portion of the torso and legs.  The sleeves may be a different color from the rest of the garment.  [[Stripe]]s are sometimes seen, most commonly on the collar and cuffs.

* Soles of the feet made from a (usually white) [[vinyl]] fabric lined with (synthetic) [[felt]], for improved durability and slip-resistance.  This can be solid vinyl with a rough textured surface, or a vinyl-dotted fabric such as Jiffy Grip.

* Optional ''toe caps'', made from the same fabric as the soles of the feet, and covering the top front portion of the foot, for improved durability.

* Elastic to make the leg portions snug around the ankles.

* A [[zipper]] running vertically down the front of the garment, from the neck opening to the inside or front ankle of one of the legs (usually the left), designed to make it easy to put on and take off.  On teen and adult sizes, the zipper usually instead runs from the neck to the crotch.

* Optional ''snap tab'' where the zipper meets the neck opening.  This is a small tab of fabric sewed to the garment on one side of the zipper (usually the right), and fastening to the other side with a [[snap fastener]], designed to prevent discomfort from the zipper slider coming into contact with the wearer's chin.

* Optional decorative [[applique]] on one side of the chest (usually the left).

== Design considerations ==

The design of the blanket sleeper is intended to make it a very practical
garment, serving the particular needs of infants and young children at night,
especially in colder weather.  In particular, the heavy fabric, complete
coverage of the body except for the head and hands, and other features serve
to keep the wearer warm in the absence of blankets or other bed covers.  This
can be important for infants, for whom loose blankets may pose a safety hazard
(including increasing the risk of [[sudden infant death syndrome|SIDS]]), and
can also be of benefit for older children, who may still be too young to be
relied upon to keep their own sleepwear or bed covers adjusted so as to prevent
exposure to the air of bare skin.  This is reflected in advertisements by blanket
sleeper manufacturers, which often emphasize that their garments "can't be kicked
off", or that "no other covers are needed".

Considerations of style and [[fashion]] play little role in the design of the
blanket sleeper, due to the garment traditionally being worn only in the home, and
usually by children of an age at which such issues tend to be considered relatively
unimportant.  Accordingly, stylistic details of the typical blanket sleeper tend to
change very little from year to year.

The one-piece design of the blanket sleeper helps prevent it from being kicked
off, ensures that there are no gaps at the waist or ankles through which skin
could be exposed, and has the additional practical benefit that there are no
detachable pieces that could be individually misplaced.  The permanently attached
feet can also be a beneficial feature for children who are prone to get out of
bed in the morning before their parents are awake, and are too young to be relied
upon to put on [[slipper]]s or other footwear to keep their feet warm.  The snug
neck and wrists, and the use of a zipper closure rather than [[button]]s or
snap fasteners, further contribute to the warmth of the wearer by eliminating
drafts.

The blanket sleeper is designed so that it can be worn either by itself as a
standalone garment, or as a second layer worn over regular pajamas or other
sleepwear.  Although a blanket sleeper is usually warm enough to be used as the
only covering, children who are old enough to do so safely may sleep under a
blanket or other bed covers as well, or not, according to preference.

The range of materials used for [[mass production|mass-produced]] blanket
sleepers for children is severely limited, as a result of stringent U.S.
government-imposed [[flammability]] requirements.  Essentially the only materials
used since the 1950s are [[polyester]], [[acrylic fiber|acrylic]], and
[[modacrylic]], with polyester dominating. Unfortunately, this can have a
negative impact on comfort for many wearers, particularly children with
[[eczema]].

Adult-size sleepers, especially those sold by small Internet businesses, can be
found in a wider range of materials, including natural fabrics such as [[cotton]]
[[flannel]].  Some web businesses also offer sleepers in natural fabrics for
children, but only outside the U.S.  In particular, special ''eczema sleepsuits''
for children, made of cotton and with built-in mitts designed to prevent
scratching, are available from specialty stores in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].

The fabrics used in most blanket sleepers have a strong tendency to pill.
Although this does not adversely affect the garment's functional utility, it has
the effect that a used garment can be clearly, visually distinguished from a new
one after only a small number of wearings or washings.

Decorative features such as appliques or printed designs usually follow
juvenile themes, and are designed to make the garments more attractive to the
children who wear them.

In addition to purely pragmatic considerations related to warmth and comfort,
the minimization of skin exposure afforded by the blanket sleeper may also
appeal (or may have previously appealed) to cultural [[mores]] relating to
[[modesty|body modesty]], particularly as these apply (or have historically
applied) to children.  This can, for example, be a consideration for some
parents when siblings sleep in the same room and/or bed.

Yet another potential benefit of the blanket sleeper is that it may help
prevent infants from removing or interfering with their diapers during the
night.  This can also apply to older children with certain developmental
disabilities, such as [[Angelman Syndrome]].  (In particular, parents of
Angleman children have been known to take such additional measures as cutting
the feet off the sleeper and putting it on backwards, and/or covering the
zipper with [[duct tape]].)  Some specialty [[adaptive clothing]] purveyors
offer blanket sleepers, with or without feet, for adults with [[dementia]]
or other disabilities, for similar reasons.

== Sizes, gender differences, and availability ==

In the United States and Canada, mass-produced blanket sleepers for both boys
and girls up to size 4 (see [[US standard clothing size]]s) are quite common,
and can be found in nearly any [[department store]].  Sizes larger than 4 are
progressively less common, being found in only some stores, and usually only
seasonally (peaking around October or November).  The availability of
larger-size sleepers in department stores also varies from year to year.

Alternative sources for larger-size, mass-produced sleepers include
[[online auction business model|Internet auction sites]], such as [[eBay]], and
certain [[mail order]] clothing retailers, such as [[Lands' End]].

Individual blanket sleepers can be marketed either as a [[gender-blind|unisex]]
garment, or as a garment intended for one gender.  Even in the latter case,
however, there is often no difference stylistically between sleepers marketed
specifically for boys, and ones marketed specifically for girls.  (The size
numbers are also consistent, as, although there are slight differences in the
meanings of size numbers between boys and girls in the U.S. standard clothing size
system, these are too small to matter in the case of a garment as loose-fitting
as a blanket sleeper.)  Occasionally, however, sleepers marketed for girls may
include effeminate decorative features such as [[lace|lacy]] frills, and
sleepers with screen-printed front panels may feature images of media characters
appealing primarily to children of one gender.  Also, the ranges of colors
available may be different between the genders.  (In particular, pink sleepers
are rarely worn by boys, due to a cultural association of that color with
femininity.)

In smaller sizes, there is little or no difference in the availability of
sleepers for boys and for girls.  However, the culturally-perceived
age-appropriateness of the blanket sleeper falls off more rapidly for boys than
for girls, and sleepers for older boys and men are correspondingly less common
than those for older girls and women, with the gap in availability increasing as
the size increases.  (For older girls, much of the appeal of wearing blanket
sleepers may be based on the playful norm-flouting quality of wearing a garment
traditionally worn only by younger children; for boys of the same age, this
would tend to be considered less culturally acceptable.)  Nevertheless, sleepers
for boys, as well as for girls, continue to have a reasonable degree of
availability in department stores (and Internet auction sites) up to about size
14 or 16.

Blanket sleepers for adult women are uncommon, but in most years can be found
in at least one major department store chain.

Mass-produced blanket sleepers for adult men are extremely rare, and when they
do appear are usually two-piece, and/or have detachable feet.  However, major
[[pattern (sewing)|home sewing pattern]] publishers sometimes offer patterns
for conventionally-styled blanket sleepers in men's sizes, and in the Internet
Age a [[cottage industry]] has developed, with several websites offering
blanket sleepers manufactured on a small scale for men as well as women and
children.  (A list of these appears in the
''[[#Web businesses|Web businesses]]'' section, below.)  Also, mass-produced,
unisex-styled blanket sleepers marketed for women are sometimes purchased and
worn by men, although the difference in the size ranges between men and women
means that this option is availabile only to men of smaller stature.

The blanket sleeper can be a subject of [[sexual fetishism|fetishistic]]
interest, particularly among [[infantilism|paraphilic infantilists]]. Much
(though certainly not all) of the demand for blanket sleepers in adult
(especially men's) sizes likely derives from this source, and many of the small
businesses that sell blanket sleepers on the Internet specifically cater to it.
(See ''[[#Blanket sleepers as fetishwear|Blanket sleepers as fetishwear]]'',
below.)

== Terminology ==

The terminology relating to blanket sleepers can be confusing, and
inconsistent between different speakers.

The terms ''sleeper'' and ''blanket sleeper'' are sometimes used
interchangeably.  Alternatively, a distinction may be made between the
lighter-weight (footed, one-piece) ''sleepers'' worn by infants in warmer
weather, and the heavier ''blanket'' sleepers worn by both infants and older
children, primarily in colder weather.  (In the loosest usage, ''sleeper'' by
itself can mean any infant sleeping garment, regardless of form or features.)
Similarly, some people consider a ''blanket'' sleeper to be one-piece by
definition, whereas a ''sleeper'' could be made either in one piece, or in two
pieces meeting at the waist.

When ''blanket'' is omitted, either the singular form ''sleeper'' or the plural
form ''sleepers'' may be used to refer to a single garment.  When ''blanket'' is
included, however, a single garment is usually referred to using the singular
form.

The terms ''(blanket) sleeper'' and ''footed pajamas'' may be used
interchangeably.  (This reflects the North American practice of referring to
nearly any sleeping garment as ''[[pajamas]]'', as blanket sleepers bear little
resemblance to the jacket and trouser combination, originating in [[India]],
that the term ''pajamas'' originally referred to.)  Alternatively, ''sleeper''
may instead be used more narrowly than ''footed pajamas'', to exclude footed
sleeping garments that are lighter-weight and/or two-piece, such as footed "ski"
style pajamas.

Also, while many people consider built-in feet to be part of the definition of
''sleeper'', garments otherwise meeting the definition but lacking feet are
sometimes marketed as ''footless blanket sleepers''.

The term ''grow sleeper'' is sometimes used to refer to a two-piece footed
sleeping garment with features designed to compensate for growth in the
wearer, such as turn-back cuffs, or a double row of snap fasteners at the
waist.

Other terms that are used more-or-less interchangeably with
''blanket sleeper'' include:

* ''footed sleeper''
* ''footed pj's''
* ''feeted/feety/footy/footsie/feetsie/feet pajamas''
* ''pajamas with feet''
* ''pajamas with the feet in them''
* ''padded feet pajamas''
* ''one-piece pajamas''
* ''zip-up pajamas''
* ''sleeper suit''
* ''sleeper blanket''
* ''walking blanket''
* ''walking sleeper''
* ''sleeper walker''
* ''oversleeper'' (used in advertisements by [[J.C. Penney]])
* ''bunny suit''
* ''bunny pajamas''
* ''bunny feet pajamas''
* ''dormer'' (older girls' and women's sizes only)

Also, a number of commercial brand names have been adopted as
[[genericized trademark]]s.  The best known of these is
''[[Dr. Denton|Dr. Dentons]]'', but others used include ''Trundle Bundle''
and ''Jama-Blanket''.

Formerly used, obsolete terms include:

* ''night drawers''
* ''sleeping drawers''
* ''sleeping garment''
* ''coverlet sleeper''
* ''pajunion'' (used in advertisements by Brighton-Carlsbad)

In [[British English]], the term with a meaning closest to that of
''blanket sleeper'' is ''sleepsuit''.

Infants' garments similar to blanket sleepers, but with the bottom portion
constructed like a bag, without separate leg enclosures, are usually not
considered ''sleepers'', but rather are referred to by other terms such as
''bunting'', ''[[sleeping bag (infant)|sleeping bag]]'', ''sleepsack'', or
''grow bag''.

Infants' garments similar to blanket sleepers, but designed for use as outerwear
rather than sleepwear (and usually featuring hoods and hand covers), are
referred to by other terms such as ''[[pram suit]]'' or ''carriage suit''.

Infants' garments similar to blanket sleepers, but designed for dual use as both
sleepwear and playwear, are sometimes known as ''sleep 'n' play'' suits.

== History ==

The origins of the blanket sleeper can be traced at least as far back as the
late 19th Century, to footed, one-piece sleeping garments for children, then
known as ''night drawers''.  However, the blanket sleeper first took something
closely resembling its present form in the early 1950s, when many of the most
recognizable features were first adopted, including the use of synthetic
fabrics, slip-resistant soles, toe caps, rib-knit collar and cuffs, zipper
closure, snap tab, and applique.  The term ''blanket sleeper'' also first came
into common use at this time, although ''sleeper'' by itself appeared
considerably earlier.

Sleepers made before the 1950s were usually made from knitted natural
fabrics, either [[cotton]], [[wool]] (especially [[merino]]), or a mixure of
both.  Commonly used fabrics included outing [[flannel]] and flannelette.
(Home-made sleepers were typically made out of fabric pieces cut from actual
blankets.)  The soles of the feet were usually made from the same material as
the rest of the sleeper, though sometimes two layers were used for improved
durability.  The collar and cuffs were usually [[hem|hemmed]], and the sleeper
usually closed with [[button]]s, either in the front or in the back.

Natural fabrics were largely abandoned after the Flammable Fabrics Act of
1953, which imposed strict [[flammability]] requirements on children's
sleepwear sold in the United States, up to size 14.  Flammability requirements
were tightened further in the early 1970s, and in 1977 the flame-retarding
additive [[tris|TRIS]] was discovered to be carcinogenic, prompting a recall, and
leading to the abandonment of such additives and the materials that depended on
them for their flame-resistance.

The popularity of blanket sleepers for older children got a boost in the 1970s
and early 1980s due to the [[energy crisis|energy crises]] of
[[1973 energy crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]].  Advertisements
from this period often emphasized that thermostats could be set lower at night
when children slept in blanket sleepers.

== Variations ==

Blanket sleepers sometimes depart from the standard design by incorporating
unusual or uncommon features.  An incomplete list of these follows.

;Drop seat

One of the features most commonly associated with blanket sleepers in the public imagination, the ''drop seat'' (also known as a ''trap door'' or ''butt flap'') is an opening in the buttocks area, traditionally closing with buttons, designed to allow the user to use the toilet without removing the sleeper.  Drop seats were very common on sleepers made before the 1950s, but today they are rather rare.  (Similar drop seats were also a common feature on the traditional [[union suit]].)

Modern versions of the drop seat often replace the buttons with snap fasteners.

;Snap front/legs

Some sleepers, especially in infant sizes, replace the usual front zipper with a front opening closing with snap fasteners.  In infant sizes, this opening usually forks at the crotch, and extends down the insides of both legs to the ankles, in order to give access for diaper changes.  This design tends to be less effective at eliminating drafts than the zipper closure, and is most often seen on lighter-weight sleepers designed for warmer weather.  (Note that many people consider such lighter-weight garments to be sleepers, but not ''blanket'' sleepers.  See [[#Terminology|Terminology]].)

Some infant-size blanket sleepers made in the 1960s featured an ankle-to-ankle zipper through the crotch, serving a similar function.

;Snap waist/back

Two-piece sleepers sometimes fasten around the waist with snap fasteners.  This is most often seen on so-called ''grow sleepers'', made mainly in toddler sizes, with features designed to extend the useful life of the garment by compensating for growth in the wearer.  These are usually made in lighter material than one-piece sleepers, with an especially high waist, two rows of snaps on the top piece, a back opening on the top piece also closing with snaps, and turn-back cuffs.

Two-piece sleepers made before the 1950s often fastened similarly around the waist with buttons.

;Drawstring cuffs

A common feature on sleepers until about the 1930s was turn-back cuffs closing at the ends with drawstrings, designed to fully enclose the wearer's hands.  According to advertisements, these were intended both to keep the wearer's hands warm, and to discourage [[thumb sucking|thumb or finger sucking]].  (These were mostly found on smaller sizes, but have appeared on ''Dr. Denton'' brand sleepers in sizes for children as old as 10 years.)

;Costume sleepers

Occasionally garments are made that are designed to serve a dual function, as both blanket sleeper and fancy dress [[costume]] (similar to the ones worn by American children on [[Halloween]]).  Animal costume sleepers are the most common, often featuring hoods with costume ears, tails, and/or hand covers resembling paws.  Other motifs such as [[superhero|superheroes]] or clowns are also sometimes seen. 

The use of the terms ''bunny suit'' and ''bunny pajamas'' as synonyms for ''blanket sleeper'' references the persistent cultural [[meme]] of a blanket sleeper fashioned as a (usually pink) bunny costume, with a hood, long ears, and puffy tail.  (Several examples can be found in the ''[[#In popular culture|In popular culture]]'' section, below.)

A related phenomenon in [[Japan]], of footless, lighter-weight, hooded, one-piece animal costume pajamas, is known there as ''disguise pajama'' or ''[[kigurumi]]'' (although the latter term can also refer to costumes that are not intended as sleepwear).

;Minor variations

;;Side zipper

:A rare alternative to the center front zipper is the "side zipper", running from the neckline near one shoulder (usually the left) to the outside or front ankle.  This is most commonly found on sleepers with an elaborate printed design on the front, in which case it serves to avoid disruption of the image.

:An even rarer variation is to have zippers on both sides.

;;Back zipper

:Although back closings using buttons were common on sleepers made before the 1950s, zippers in the back are extremely rare.  A number of examples existed in the 1950s and 1960s, however.

;;Self-fabric feet

:Sleepers made in sizes for infants who are too young to walk often omit the slip-resistant soles on the feet, instead having soles made from the same fabric as the rest of the sleeper.  This is also occasionally seen on sleepers for older girls or women.

;;Bound feet

:On sleepers made since the 1980s, the soles of the feet usually attach to the upper foot pieces with an inward-facing seam.  In preceding years, it was more common for the seam to face outward, and to be covered with a narrow strip of material, forming a kind of ridge around the perimeter of the sole.  This design was referred to in advertisements as a ''bound edge'' or ''bound foot'', and was intended both to improve durability, and to improve comfort by eliminating a potential source of irritation.

;;Molded plastic feet

:Around 1970, some sleepers were made with foot bottoms made from three-dimensional molded plastic.  This feature proved unpopular, and was quickly abandoned.

;;Detachable feet

:Occasionally, rather than having permanently attached feet, sleepers will come with separate feet, similar to slippers.  This is more common on adult sizes.

;;Convertible feet

:Another variation replaces the permanently enclosed feet with "convertible" foot coverings resembling tube [[socks]], that close at the ends with [[velcro]], and can be rolled back to expose the feet when desired.

;;Hood

:Attached [[hood (headgear)|hoods]] were occasionally seen on sleepers made before the 1920s, and as late as the 1940s the company that made ''Dr. Denton'' brand sleepers offered separate "sleeping hoods", designed to be used in conjunction with their sleepers, in sizes for both children and adults.  On modern sleepers attached hoods are extremely rare, found only on a handful of sleepers for older girls and women.

;;Quilted fabric

:Sleepers are occasionally made from a [[quilting|quilted]] fabric, incorporating a thin layer of polyester fiberfill [[batting]] for increased warmth.  Quilted sleepers using polyester [[foam]] as insulation were also made in the 1950s.

;;Elastic back waist

:Sleepers in larger sizes sometimes feature an elastic band along the rear half of the waist, designed to provide a better fit by reducing bagginess around the torso.
