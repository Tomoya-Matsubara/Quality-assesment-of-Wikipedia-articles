Maya danced during the Soviet era at the same time as the great [[Galina Ulanova]], and took over from her as [[prima ballerina assoluta]] of the [[Bolshoi Theatre|Bolshoi]] in 1960. Maya Plisetskaya is a naturalized Spanish and Lithuanian citizen.

==Early life==
Maya Plisetskaya was born in Moscow into a prominent [[Jewish]] family.<ref name="Miller 1984">{{cite book

In 1938, her father, [[Michael Plisetski]] was executed during the [[Great Purge|Stalinist purges]], possibly because he had hired a friend who had been a secretary to [[Leon Trotsky]]. Her mother [[Rachel Messerer|Rachel Messerer-Plisetskaya]] (aka ''Ra Messerer''), a silent-film actress, was arrested and sent to a [[labor camp]] ([[Gulag]]) in [[Kazakhstan]],<ref name=eaton>{{cite book

Maya studied under the great ballerina of imperial school, [[Elizaveta Gerdt]]. She first performed at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] when she had just turned 11 years of age. In 1943, she graduated from the choreographic school and joined the Bolshoi Ballet,<ref name=autobiography/> where she would perform until 1990.

==Career==

From the beginning, Maya was a different kind of ballerina. She spent very short time in the [[corps de ballet]] after graduation and was quickly named a soloist. Her bright [[red hair]] and striking looks made her a glamorous figure on and off the stage. Her long arms had a fluidity that to this day remains unmatched; her interpretation of ''[[The Dying Swan]]'', a short showcase piece made famous by [[Anna Pavlova]], became Maya's calling card. Maya was known for the height of her jumps, her extremely flexible back, the technical strength of her dancing, and her charisma. She excelled both in adagio and allegro, which is very unusual in dancers.

Despite her acclaim, Maya was not treated well by the Bolshoi management. She was [[Judaism|Jewish]]<ref name="Miller 1984"/> in an [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] climate, her family had been purged during the Stalinist era and her personality was defiant, so she was not allowed to tour outside the country for six years after joining the Bolshoi.<ref name=eaton/> It wasn't until 1959 that [[Nikita Khrushchev]] permitted her to travel abroad,<ref>{{cite book

Maya's most acclaimed roles included [[Swan Lake#Odette|Odette]]-[[Swan Lake#Act 3|Odile]] in ''[[Swan Lake]]'' (1947) and Aurora in ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1961). In 1958, she was honoured with the title of the [[People's Artist of the USSR]] and married the young composer [[Rodion Shchedrin]], in whose subsequent fame she shared.

After [[Galina Ulanova]] left the stage in 1960, Maya Plisetskaya was proclaimed the ''[[prima ballerina assoluta]]'' of the [[Bolshoi Theatre]]. In the Soviet screen version of ''[[Anna Karenina]]'', she played Princess Tverskaya. In 1971, her husband the composer Rodion Shchedrin wrote a ballet on the same subject, where she would play the leading role. ''Anna Karenina'' was also her first attempt at choreography.<ref>{{cite book

In the 1980s, Plisetskaya and Shchedrin spent much time abroad, where she worked as the artistic director of the Rome Opera Ballet in 1984<U+2013>5, then the Spanish National Ballet of [[Madrid]] from 1987<U+2013>9. At the age of 65, she finally retired from the Bolshoi as a soloist. On her 70th birthday, she debuted in B<U+00E9>jart's piece choreographed for her and entitled "Ave Maya". Since 1994, she has been presiding over the annual international ballet competitions called ''Maya''. In 1996 she was named President of the Imperial Russian Ballet.<ref name=sleeman>{{cite book

She was forced to be member of the [[Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet Public]] by being threatened with having her passport revoked.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} When she traveled abroad in the 1960s, the Soviet secret police requested that she encourage the interest of [[Robert F. Kennedy]], which she declined.<ref name=eaton/>

On her 80th birthday, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' summed up current opinion about Maya in the following words: "She was, and still is, a star, ballet's ''monstre sacre'', the final statement about theatrical glamour, a flaring, flaming beacon in a world of dimly twinkling talents, a beauty in the world of prettiness."<ref>{{cite news
