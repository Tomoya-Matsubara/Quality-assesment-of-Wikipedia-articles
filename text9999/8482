Cotton farming in the United States is synonymous with the [[African-American history of agriculture in the United States|African-American history]] in the country. By the late 1920s around two-thirds of all African-American tenants and almost three-fourths of the croppers worked on cotton farms, and 2 in 3 black women from black landowning families were involved in cotton farming. Cotton farming was one of the major areas of racial tension in its history, where many whites expressed concerns about the mass employment of blacks in the industry and the dramatic growth of black landowners. Southern black cotton farmers faced discrimination from the north in particular, and often strikes by black cotton farmers often broke out. Although the industry was badly affected by falling prices and pests in the early 1920s, the main reason is undoubtedly the mechanization of agriculture in explaining why many blacks moved to northern American cities in the 1940s and 1950s during the "[[Second Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]" as mechanization of agriculture was introduced, leaving many unemployed.<ref name="Plaque">{{cite web|url=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qujGtayDb7g/UO3zEIP35SI/AAAAAAAACdM/fXHmm9GaDg4/s1600/029.JPG|title=Cotton Pickin' Blues|publisher=Mississippi Blues Commission|accessdate=3 June 2013}}</ref> The [[Hopson Planting Company]] produced the first crop of cotton to be entirely planted, harvested and baled by machinery in 1944.<ref name="Plaque"/>

===Background===
Imported from Europe, cotton has an ancient history of over 5000 years, and is also traced to [[Alexander]] carrying cotton cloth on his shoulders while returning from India.<ref name=Yafa>{{Cite book|last=Yafa|first=Stephen|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/big-cotton-stephen-yafa/1114956200?ean=9780670033676|title=Big Cotton: The Biography of a Revolutionary Fiber |work=Overview and editorial reviews|accessdate=2 June 2013|publisher= Barnesandnoble.com/}}</ref>

[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] were observed growing cotton by the Coronado expedition in the early 1540s.<ref>[http://www.cottonsjourney.com/Storyofcotton/page2.asp "History"], Cotton's Journey. Retrieved 5 June 2013.</ref> This also ushered the slave trade to meet the growing need for labour to grow cotton, a labour intensive crop and a cash crop of immense economic worth. And in the American South an entire civilization was based the "King Cotton". As the chief crop, the southern part of USA prospered thanks to the slavery centric civilization. Over the centuries cotton became a staple crop in American agriculture. The cotton farming also subsidized in the country by U.S. government, as a trade policy, specifically to the <U+201C>corporate agribusiness<U+201D> almost ruined the economy of people in many under developed countries such as [[Mali]] and many other developing countries (in view of low profits in the light of stiff competition from the US the workers could hardly make both ends meet to survive with cotton sales).<ref name=Yafa/>

Historians believe that cotton was introduced into the US by immigrants.

===20th century===
The conditions for black cotton farmers gradually improved during the 20th century. [[Ralph J. Bunche]], an expert in Negro suffrage in the United States, observed in 1940 that "many thousands of black cotton farmers each year now go to the polls, stand in line with their white neighbors, and mark their ballots independently without protest or intimidation, in order to determine government policy toward cotton production control."<ref name="Lawson1999">{{cite book|last=Lawson|first=Steven F.|title=Black Ballots: Voting Rights in the South, 1944 - 1969|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RqFOuIhndtYC&pg=PA20|accessdate=3 June 2013|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-0087-5|page=20}}</ref> However, discrimination towards blacks continued as it did in the rest of society, and isolated incidents often broke out.

The introduction of modern textile machinery such as spinning jenny, power loom, and cotton gin brought in more profits, and cotton towns, <U+201C>more benign than the British<U+201D> came to be established in the country. Following the end of slavery in the southern states, and with immigrants taking control of cotton farming, the [[boll weevil]], an imported variety from Mexico, brought in the 1920s, became popular. The fashion cloth of the [[Jeans|blue jeans]] furthered boom of cotton for 3 decades. Adoption of chemical pesticides to reduce diseases and thus increase yield of the crop further boosted production. Further innovations in the form of [[genetic engineering]] and of [[nanotechnology]] are an encouraging development for the growth of cotton.<ref name=Yafa/>

The cotton industry in the United States hit a crisis in the early 1920s. Cotton and tobacco prices collapsed in 1920 following overproduction and the boll weevil pest wiped out the sea island cotton crop in 1921.

==Cotton production by state==

===Texas===
Texas produces more cotton than any other state in the US. With eight production regions around Texas, it is the state's leading cash crop. Texas produces approximately 25% of the country's cotton crop on more than 6,000,000 acres, the equivalent of over {{convert|9000|sqmi}} of cotton fields.<ref name=tamu.edu>{{cite web|title=Texas|url=http://cotton.tamu.edu/cottoncountry.htm|publisher=Soil and Crop Sciences Department, Texas A&M University}}</ref> Texas Cotton Producers includes 9 certified cotton grower organizations; it address national and statewide cotton grower issues, such as the national farm bill and environmental legislation.<ref name=texagnet.com>{{cite web|title=Texas Cotton Producers|url=http://www.texagnet.com/tx_cotton_producers.htm|publisher=Texagnet}}</ref>

===California===
California<U+2019>s cotton is mostly grown in seven counties within the [[San Joaquin Valley]], though [[Imperial Valley]] and [[Palo Verde Valley]] also have acres planted. In the 1990s cotton was also planted in the [[Sacramento Valley]]. California is the largest producer of Pima cotton in the U.S. The California cotton industry provides more than 20,000 jobs in the state and generates revenues in excess of $3.5 billion annually.<ref name=calcot.com>{{cite web|title=California Cotton Questions & Answers|url=http://www.calcot.com/ourcotton.asp?post=cavar&flag=ourcotton|work=calcot.com|accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref>

===Arizona===
In the late 19th and early 20th century, federal agricultural engineers worked in the [[Arizona Territory]] on an experimental farm in [[Sacaton, Arizona|Sacaton]]. It was here that [[Pima people|Pima Indians]] cultivated various cotton hybrids seeking ideal traits. By the early 1900s, the botanist [[Thomas Henry Kearney]] (1874-1956) created a long staple cotton which was named Pima after the Indians who grew it. In 1910, it was released into the marketplace. While in 1987, Arizona was producing 66% of the country<U+2019>s Pima cotton, it has dropped to only 2% in recent years.<ref name=arizonaexperience.org>{{cite web|title=The Pima Cotton Boom|url=http://arizonaexperience.org/remember/pima-cotton-boom|work=arizonaexperience.org|accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref>

From 1817 when it became a state, to 1860, Mississippi was the largest cotton-producing state in the US.<ref name=Dattel>{{cite web|last=Dattel|first=Eugene R.|title=Cotton in a Global Economy: Mississippi (1800-1860)|url=http://mshistorynow.mdah.state.ms.us/articles/161/cotton-in-a-global-economy-mississippi-1800-1860|publisher=Mississippi Historical Society}}</ref> Cotton is a major crop in Mississippi with approximately 1.1 million acres planted each year. The highest acreage recorded was in 1930 (4.163 million acres); the highest production year was 1937 (2.692 million bales produced over 3.421 million acres); the highest cotton yields were in 2004 (1034 pounds of lint produced per acre).<ref name=msucares.com>{{cite web|title=Cotton Production in Mississippi|url=http://msucares.com/crops/cotton/|publisher=Mississippi State University}}</ref>
===Florida===
Cotton growing is confined to the western-most tip of the state; over 50% of the [[Santa Rosa County, Florida|Santa Rosa County]]'s harvest is of cotton.
