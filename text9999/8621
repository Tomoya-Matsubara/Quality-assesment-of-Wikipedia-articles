The '''''Loire''''' was a 44-gun [[frigate]] of the [[French Navy]].<ref>''London Gazette'', [http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/15081/pages/1100 Issue no. 15081, page 1100]</ref> She was captured following the [[Battle of Tory Island]] by a [[Royal Navy]] frigate squadron and subsequently taken into British service as HMS Loire.

==French service and capture==
She took part in the [[Exp<U+00E9>dition d'Irlande]], and in the [[Action of 12 October 1798|Battle of Tory Island]], where she battled {{HMS|Kangaroo|1795|2}}, {{HMS|Robust|1764|2}}, and {{HMS| Anson |1781|2}}. After the battle, ''Loire'' and [[French frigate S<U+00E9>millante (1792)|''S<U+00E9>millante'']] escaped into Black Cod Bay, where they hoped to hide until they had a clear passage back to France. However, late on 15 October, a British frigate squadron under [[James Newman-Newman|James Newman Newman]] rounded the southern headland of the bay, forcing the French ships to flee to the north.<ref name="WJ137">James, p. 137</ref> Pressing on sail in pursuit, Newman ordered ''R<U+00E9>volutionaire'' to focus on ''S<U+00E9>millante'' whilst he pursued ''Loire'' in {{HMS|Mermaid|1782|2}}, accompanied by the brig {{HMS|Kangaroo|1795|2}} under Commander [[Edward Brace]]. ''Loire'' and ''S<U+00E9>millante'' separated to divide their pursuers; ''Mermaid'' and ''Kangaroo'' lost track of ''Loire'' in the early evening, and ''S<U+00E9>millante'' evaded ''R<U+00E9>volutionaire'' after dark. ''Mermaid'' and ''Kangaroo'' eventually found ''Loire'' on 17 October, but after an inconclusive fight that left the British unable to pursue, ''Loire'' broke off the engagement and escaped. The next day ''Loire'' again engaged ''Kangaroo'' and ''Anson'', and was forced to [[Striking the colours|strike]] after she ran out of ammunition. Out of the 664 men, including three artillery regiments and their ''Etat-Major'',  carried on board ''Loire'', 48 were killed and 75 wounded. She was also found to be carrying a large store of clothing, weapons, ammunition and tools for her troops' intended operations.<ref>London Gazette, issue 15075, page 1026</ref> ''Anson'' had two men killed and 13 wounded, while the ''Kangaroo'' appears to have suffered no casualties.<ref>London Gazette, issue number: 15081, page number: 1100</ref>

==British service==
[[Her Majesty's Ship|HMS]] ''Loire'' was commissioned by Captain [[Frederick Lewis Maitland (Rear Admiral)|Frederick Lewis Maitland]] at Portsmouth in October 1802.

On 27 June 1803 the ''Loire'''s boats captured the French navy brig ''Venteux'' while she was anchored close to shore batteries on the [[<U+00CE>le de Batz]]. ''Venteux'' had a crew of 82 men under the command of ''lieutenant de vaisseau'' Gilles-Fran<U+00E7>ois Montfort and was armed with four 18-pounder guns and six 36-pounder brass [[carronade]]s. The ''Loire'' lost her boatswain and five men badly wounded; the French lost their second captain and two men killed, and all five remaining officers, including Montfort, wounded, as well as eight other men wounded. <ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=791 |issue=15598|date=2 July 1803}}</ref> In 1847 the Admiralty recognized the action with the clasp "27 June Boat Service 1803" to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded to all surviving claimants from the action. The Royal Navy brought ''Venteux'' into service as {{HMS|Eagle|1803|2}}, and next year renamed her HMS ''Eclipse''.<ref>Winfield (2008), p.348.</ref>

On 17 March 1804 ''Loire'' sighted a strange vessel on the Irish station and made all sail in pursuit.  She came up with and captured what proved to be the French privateer ''Braave'', of 14 guns and 110 men.

On 16 August 1804 ''Loire'' gave chase to a suspicious-looking sail. After a chase of 20 hours, including a running fight of a quarter of an hour, during which the British had one midshipman and five men wounded, and the French lost two men killed and five wounded, the latter hauled down her colours. She proved to be French privateer ''Blonde'', of Bordeaux, mounting 30 guns, eight-pounders on the main deck, with a crew of 240 men; the same ship that, about five months earlier, had captured the ''Wolverine''.<ref>James, Naval History of Great Britain - Vol III, p 276</ref> ''Loire'' took the prize in tow to Plymouth where the prisoners were disembarked on 31 August. 

On 2 June 1805 boats from ''Loire'' captured the Spanish privateer [[felucca]] ''Esperanza'' alias ''San Pedro'' in the Bay of Camarinas, east of Cape Finisterre. She was armed with three eighteen-pounders, four four-pounder brass [[swivels]] and a crew of 50 men. ''Loire'' had only three men slightly wounded. The captured Spanish crew had lost 19 of their 50 men, mostly killed, some however jumped overboard.<ref>London Gazette</ref>

On 4 June 1805 ''Loire'' made an attack on [[Muros]]. Two French privateer vessels were discovered lying in the bay, including the ''Confiance'' pierced for 26 guns, twelve- and nine-pounders, although not having them on board. A landing party of 50 men from ''Loire'' under first lieutenant [[James Lucas Yeo]] stormed the town's fort (which was firing its 12 eighteen-pounder guns on the ship), slaying the governor and many of the defenders (including some of the French crews) and forcing the remainder to surrender. Yeo hoisted the British colours, spiked the guns and rendered the carriages unserviceable. ''Loire'' had six men slightly wounded in the shore party (including Yeo), with a further nine injured on the ship, one dangerously. The ''Confiance'' was taken possession of and subsequently brought into service under Yeo's command{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. The second vessel, the ''Belier'' brig pierced for 20 eighteen-pounder [[carronades]] was deemed too unseaworthy to carry away, so Maitland burnt her. The clasp "4 June Boat Service 1805" was added to the [[Naval General Service Medal (1847)|Naval General Service Medal]] and issued to surviving claimants in respect of the action.

On 24 December 1805,<ref>''London Gazette'', 28 December 1805, Issue number: 15876, Page number: 1625</ref> along with [[French frigate Egyptienne (1799)|HMS ''Egyptienne'']], she captured the French [[French frigate Libre (1796)|''Libre'']], and took her in tow to Plymouth. ''Libre'' was not purchased into service.

On 22 April 1806, ''Loire'' captured the Spanish privateer ''Princess of Peace'', 14 guns, 23 men.

''Loire'' was paid off at Deptford in October 1806.

On 21 June 1810 ''Loire'' and {{HMS|Erebus|1807|2}} escorted 100 vessels through the [[Great Belt]] into the Baltic.

On 18 February 1814, ''Loire'' encountered the [[USS President (1800)|USS ''President'']] off New York. ''Loire'' escaped once she realized ''President'' was a 44-gun frigate.<ref name="Teddy286">Roosevelt (1883), p. 286.</ref><ref name="MaclaySmith541">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, p. 541.</ref>

==Fate==
On 14 October 1817 the Navy Commissioners gave notice in the [[London Gazette]] that the ''Loire'' (among other ships), then lying at Plymouth, would be offered for sale at their offices from the 30th.<ref>http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/17296/pages/2157</ref>  She was eventually broken up in 1818.
