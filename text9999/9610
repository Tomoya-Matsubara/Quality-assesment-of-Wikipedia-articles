{{otheruses4|virtual user representations|other uses|Avatar (disambiguation)}}
An '''avatar''' is a computer user's representation of himself/herself or alter ego, whether in the form of a three-dimensional model used in computer games,<ref>[[Lawrence Lessig|Lessig, Lawrence]]. ''Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace''. Basic Books, 2000. ISBN 0-465-03913-8</ref> a two-dimensional [[icon]] (picture) used on [[Internet forum]]s and other communities,<Ref>Fink, Jeri. ''Cyberseduction: Reality in the Age of Psychotechnology''. Prometheus Books, 1999. ISBN 1-57392-743-0</ref><ref>Blackwood, Kevin. ''Casino Gambling For Dummies''. For Dummies, 2006. p.284. ISBN 0-471-75286-X</ref> or a text construct found on early systems such as [[MUD]]s. It is an <U+201C>object<U+201D> representing the embodiment of the user. The term "avatar" can also refer to the personality connected with the [[screen name (computing)|screen name]], or handle, of an Internet user.<ref>Jordan, Tim. ''Cyberpower: The Culture and Politics of Cyberspace and the Internet''. Routledge, 1999. ISBN 0-415-17078-8</ref>

==Origin==
In English, the word has come to mean "an embodiment, a bodily manifestation of the Divine." However, the Sanskrit word Avatara means  "incarnation."  The term is used primarily in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts. For example, [[Krishna]] is the eighth avatar (incarnation) of [[Vishnu]] the Preserver, whom many '''Hindus''' worship as '''God'''. The [[Avatar|Dasavatara]] are ten particular "great" incarnations of [[Vishnu]].

===Computer games===
As used for a computer representation of a user, the term dates at least as far back as 1985, when it was used as the name for the player character in the ''[[Ultima (video game series)|Ultima]]'' series of computer games. The ''Ultima'' games started out in 1981, but it was in ''[[Ultima IV]]'' (1985), that the term "Avatar" was introduced. To become the "Avatar" was the goal of ''Ultima IV''. The later games assumed that you were the Avatar and "Avatar" was the player's visual on-screen in-game persona. The on-screen representation could be customized in appearance. Later, the term "avatar" was used by the designers of the [[pen and paper]] role-playing game ''[[Shadowrun]]'' (1989), as well as in the online role-playing game ''[[Habitat (video game)|Habitat]]'' (1987).<ref name="Morabito">Morabito, Margaret. "Enter the Online World of LucasFilm." Run Aug. 1986: 24-28</ref>

===Neal Stephenson===
The use of ''Avatar''  to mean online virtual bodies was popularised by [[Neal Stephenson]] in his [[cyberpunk]] novel ''[[Snow Crash]]'' (1992). <ref>[http://www.cwru.edu/help/webglossary.html A Beginner's Web Glossary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In ''Snow Crash,'' the term ''Avatar'' was used to describe the virtual simulation of the human form in the ''[[Metaverse]]'', a virtual-reality version of the [[Internet]]. [[Social status]] within the Metaverse was often based on the quality of a user's avatar, as a highly detailed avatar showed that the user was a skilled [[Hacker (computing)|hacker]] and [[programmer]] while the less talented would buy off-the-shelf models in the same manner a beginner would today. Stephenson wrote in the "Acknowledgments" to ''Snow Crash'':
:''The idea of a 'virtual reality' such as the Metaverse is by now widespread in the computer-graphics community and is being used in a number of different ways. The particular vision of the Metaverse as expressed in this novel originated from idle discussion between me and Jaime (Captain Bandwidth)Taffe...The words 'avatar' (in the sense used here) and 'Metaverse' are my inventions, which I came up with when I decided that existing words (such as 'virtual reality') were simply too awkward to use...after the first publication of 'Snow Crash' I learned that the term 'avatar' has actually been in use for a number of years as part of a virtual reality system called 'Habitat'...in addition to avatars, Habitat includes many of the basic features of the Metaverse as described in this book,''<ref>Stephenson, Neal. ''Snow Crash''. New York: Bantam, 2003 (reissue). pp. 469-70.</ref>

== On Internet forums ==
[[Image:Ice.av06-timewaits.jpg|frame|left|Example of an avatar as used on [[Internet forums]]. Notable features are the small (100x100px) size, text and a border.]]
Despite the widespread use of avatars, it is unknown which [[Internet forums]] were the first to use them; the earliest forums did not include avatars as a default feature, and they were included in unofficial "hacks" before eventually being made standard. Avatars on Internet forums serve the purpose of representing users and their actions, personalizing their contributions to the forum, and may represent different parts of their [[persona]], beliefs, interests or social status in the forum.

The traditional avatar system used on most Internet forums is a small (80x80 to 100x100 [[pixel]]s, for example) square-shaped area close to the user's forum post, where the avatar is placed in order for other users to easily identify who has written the post without having to read their username. Some forums allow the user to [[upload]] an avatar image that may have been designed by the user or acquired from elsewhere. Other forums allow the user to select an avatar from a preset list or use an auto-discovery algorithm to extract one from the user's homepage.

Some avatars are [[Animation|animated]], consisting of a [[sequence]] of multiple images played repeatedly (see image to the left). In such animated avatars, the number of images as well as the time in which they are replayed vary considerably.<ref name="Designing Isometric Avatars">[http://herbert.gandraxa.com/herbert/dia.asp Designing Isometric Avatars<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Other avatar systems exist, such as on [[Gaia Online]],[[WeeWorld]] or [[Meez]], where a pixelized representation of a person or creature is used, which can then be customized to the user's wishes.

Forum avatars have been tested as a means of advertising.<ref>[http://www.virtualmarketingblog.com/index.php/20070222/marketing-through-avatars/ Marketing Through Avatars<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Another avatar based system is one wherein an image is automatically generated based on the identity of the poster.   [[Identicon]]s are formed as visually distinct geometric images derived from a digest hash of the poster's IP address.  In this way, a particular anonymous user can be uniquely identified from session to session without the need for registration or authentication.  In the cases where registration has occurred, the identicon serves as a means to associate a particular user with a particular geometric representation.  If an account is compromised, a dissimilar identicon will be formed as the attacker is posting from an unfamiliar IP address.

== In Internet chat ==
Flat GIF based avatars were introduced by such programs as [[Virtual Places]] as early as 1994 along with VOIP capabilities which were later abandoned for lack of bandwidth.

In 1995, [[KeepTalking]], a product of UNET2 Corporation, was one of the first companies to implement an avatar system into their web chat software.

In 1995, Cybertown first introduced three dimensional avatars to internet chat. {{Fact|date=June 2007}}

In 1996 [[Microsoft Comic Chat]], an [[IRC]] client that used cartoon avatars for chatting, was released.

== In instant-messaging programs ==
[[AOL Instant Messenger]] (AIM) was the first popular [[instant messaging|instant-messaging]] program to use avatars, picking up on the idea from PC games. Users of AIM commonly refer to avatars as ''buddy icons''. Today, many other popular instant-messaging services support the use of avatars, including [[Windows Live Messenger]], [[Yahoo! Messenger]], and services using the [[XMPP|XMPP (Jabber)]] protocol such as [[Google Talk]], [[LiveJournal|LJ Talk]], and [[Gizmo Project]].

Instant messaging avatars are usually very small. AIM icons are 48x48 pixels, although many icons can be found online that typically measure anywhere from 50x50 pixels to 100x100 pixels in size. A wide variety of these imaged avatars can be found on web sites and popular eGroups such as [[Yahoo! Groups]].

The latest use of avatars in instant messaging is dominated by dynamic avatars. The user chooses an avatar that represents him while chatting and, through the use of text to speech technology, enables the avatar to talk the text being used at the chat window. Another form of use for this kind of avatar is for video chats/calls. Some services, such as Skype (through some external plugins) allow users to use [[Interactive online characters|talking avatars]] during video calls, replacing the image from the user's camera with an animated, talking avatar.<ref>[https://extras.skype.com/72/view Skype Extras<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://extras.skype.com/322/view Skype Extras<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

AIM buddy icons have been used as an experimental form of [[viral marketing]] by some advertising firms.<ref>[http://blogcritics.org/archives/2005/11/11/205341.php Coldplay's US Tour: The Results Are In<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== In blogs ==
Although blog comment pages can sometimes act like Internet forums, there is no single way to provide avatar support on blogs. One solution is to link to an image file controlled by the user. Another solution is to use a service like Gravatar and resolve the user avatar from his/her mail address.

== In artificial intelligence ==
Avatars are also used by organisations as a way of interacting with consumers. Some of these avatars are commonly known as "bots" and are powered by [[Natural Language Processing]]. Famous examples include [[Ikea]]'s Anna, an avatar designed to guide you around the Ikea website. 

Such Avatars can also be powered by a [[Digital conversation]] which provides a little more structure than those using NLP, offering the user options and clearly defined paths to an outcome. This kind of Avatar is known as a Structured Language Processing or SLP Avatar.

Both types of Avatar provide a cost effective and efficient way of engaging with consumers.

== In games ==
[[Image:Xbox NXE avatar.png|125px|thumb|right|Game consoles such as the [[Wii]] and [[Xbox 360]] feature universal animated avatars.]]
Avatars in [[video game]]s are essentially the player's physical representation in the game world. In most games, the player's representation is fixed, however increasingly games offer a basic character model, or template, and then allow customization of the physical features as the player sees fit. For example, [[Carl "CJ" Johnson|Carl Johnson]], the avatar from ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', can be dressed in a wide range of clothing, can be given [[tattoo]]s and [[haircut]]s, and can even [[bodybuilding|body build]] or become [[obesity|obese]] depending upon player actions.<ref>[http://ps2.ign.com/objects/611/611957.html IGN: Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Aside from an avatar's physical appearance, its dialogue, particularly in [[cut scene]]s, may also reveal something of its character. A good example is the crude, [[action movie|action hero]] [[stereotype]], [[Duke Nukem (character)|Duke Nukem]].<ref>[http://www.thecomputershow.com/computershow/reviews/dukenukem3d.htm Duke Nukem 3D<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Other avatars, such as [[Gordon Freeman]] from ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', who never speaks at all, reveal very little of themselves (the original game never showed the player what he looked like without the use of a console command for third-person view).

[[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s (MMORPGs) are the source of the most varied and sophisticated avatars. Customization levels differ between games; For example in [[EVE Online]], players construct a wholly customized portrait, using a software that allows for several changes to facial structure as well as preset hairstyles, skin tones, etc. <ref name="Designing Isometric Avatars"/>. However, these portraits appear only in in-game chats and static information view of other players. Usually, all players appear in gigantic spacecraft that give no view of their pilot, unlike in most other RPGs.

Alternatively, [[City of Heroes]] offers one of the most detailed and comprehensive in-game avatar creation processes, allowing players to construct anything from traditional [[superheroes]] to aliens, medieval knights, monsters, robots and many more.

[[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii]] console allows for the creation of avatars called "[[Mii]]s" that take the form of stylized, cartoonish people and can be used in some games as avatars for players, as in [[Wii Sports]].  In some games, the ability to use a Mii as an avatar must be unlocked, such as in [[Mario Kart Wii]].

[[Microsoft]] recently announced a new [[Xbox 360]] Dashboard update which features the introduction of [[Avatar (Xbox 360)|Avatars]]. Users will be able to personalize the look of their own set Avatar, by choosing from a range of clothing and facial features. This feature can be found in the dashboard, but will also be incorporated into games, including a video game version of the popular [[Endemol]] game show [[1 vs. 100]]. 

The upcoming [[PlayStation Home]] for [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 3]] console also features the use of avatars, but are more realistic looking than Nintendo's Miis or Microsoft's Avatars.

== In non-gaming universes ==
Avatars in non-gaming universes are used as two-[[dimension]]al or three-dimensional human or [[fantastic]] [[representations]] of a person's self. Such representations can explore the virtual universe they are in using their avatar, add to it, or conduct conversations with other users, and can be customized by the user. Usually, the purpose and appeal of such universes is to provide a large enhancement to common online conversation capabilities, and to allow the user to peacefully develop a portion of a non-gaming universe without being forced to strive towards a pre-defined goal.<ref>Damer, Bruce. ''Avatars: Exploring and Building Virtual Worlds on the Internet''. Peachpit Press, 1997. ISBN 0-201-68840-9</ref> 

In non-gaming universes, the criteria avatars have to fulfill in order to become useful can depend to a great extent on the age of potential users. Research suggests that younger users of [[virtual community|virtual communities]] put great emphasis on fun and entertainment aspects of avatars and their practical functionalities (such as whispering). They are also interested in the simple ease of use of avatars, and their ability to retain the user<U+2019>s [[anonymity]]. Meanwhile, older users pay great importance to an avatar<U+2019>s ability to reflect their own appearance, [[online identity|identity]] and personality. Most older users also want to be able to use an avatar<U+2019>s expressive functionalities (such as showing emotions), and are prepared to learn new ways of navigation to do it. Social scientists at [[Stanford]]'s Virtual Human Interaction Lab<ref>[http://vhil.stanford.edu VHIL: Virtual Human Interaction Lab - Stanford University<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>    examine the implications, possibilities and [[transformed social interaction]] that occur when people interact via avatars.

Avatar-based non-gaming universes are usually populated by age groups whose requirements concerning avatars are fulfilled. For example, most users of [[Habbo Hotel]], [[Ty Girlz]] and [[Webkinz]] are aged 10 to 15 years, while users of [[Gaia Online]] and [[WeeWorld]] are 13 to 18. The reason may well be the properties and functionalities of the avatars of these virtual communities. In contrast, [[There (internet service)|There]] and [[Kaneva Game Platform]] target users aged 22 to 49 and their avatars allow for a wide range of social interactions, including the expression of emotions: laughing, waving, blowing kisses and rude gestures. [[The Palace (computer program)|The Palace]], most of whose users seem to be older, allows users to use their own images as avatars. This turns the avatar into a direct reflection of users' real-life appearance, as desired by older users. 

Some researchers have suggested that customizable avatars in non-gaming worlds tend to be biased towards lighter skin colors and against darker skin colors, especially in those of the male gender.<ref>Nakamura, Lisa. ''Cybertypes: Race, Ethnicity, and Identity on the Internet''. Routledge, 2002. ISBN 0-415-93836-8</ref>  These observations are less true of [[Second Life]], where avatars range from lifelike humans to more fanciful robots, animals, and mythical creatures, with avatars created by players. The main Second Life grid is open only to adults, and participation is driven by social, artistic and commercial motivations.  <ref>http://www.realtimearts.net/article/80/8662 ''Dance Film: Spiritual Odyssey'', RealTime 80, August-September 2007.</ref><ref>http://www.slnn.com/article/thursdays-fictions/ ''Experience the next life at Thursday's Fictions'', Second Life News Network.</ref>
