'''Falafel''' ( {{lang-ar|<U+0641><U+0644><U+0627><U+0641><U+0644>}} {{Audio|ArFalafel.ogg|falaafil}} , {{lang-he|<U+05E4><U+05DC><U+05D0><U+05E4><U+05DC>}}) , also known in [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] as ta'meya (<U+0637><U+0639><U+0645><U+064A><U+0629>) is a fried ball or patty made from [[spice]]d [[fava bean]]s and/or [[chickpea]]s. Originally invented by Egyptian [[bedouins]],{{Fact|date=March 2007}} it has become a highly popular form of fast food in the [[Levant]] and in the [[Mashriq]] (Arab East), where it is also served as a ''[[mezze]]'' (snack). The word "falafel" is the plural of the Arabic word <U+0641><U+0644><U+0641><U+0644> (''filfil''), meaning pepper.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/61/94/F0019400.html <U+201C>Falafel.<U+201D>] The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 4th ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2000. Accessed on [[April 6]] [[2006]].</ref>
 
Falafel is usually served in a [[pita]] bread [[wrap (food)|wrap]] (i.e. [[sandwich]]), and the term "falafel" commonly refers to this sandwich by [[synecdoche]]; falafel in a pita is typical [[street food]] or [[fast food]]. Along with the falafel balls, which may be crushed onto the bread or added whole, [[#Topping variations|various toppings]] are usually included. Falafel balls may also be eaten alone as a snack or served as part of a [[mezze]]. During [[Ramadan]] they are sometimes eaten as part of an [[iftar]], the meal which breaks the daily fast after sunset.

The food is so popular in Israel, it is often referred to as the national dish of Israel. <ref>Yael Raviv, "Falafel: A National Icon", ''Gastronomica'', Summer 2003, '''3''':3:20-25.  Discusses how an Arab dish became "the national food of Israel".</ref>

Falafel is now seen as a uniting, pan-Middle-Eastern dish. In recent years, immigration from the Middle East to Western countries has brought with it a broader availability of [[Middle Eastern cuisine]], and the falafel sandwich has become a popular and iconic food within alternative fast food or [[slow food]] movements, and indeed has spread worldwide.

They are also used as a [[vegan]] alternative filler to a [[Doner kebab]] in many countries.

==Ingredients==
[[Image:Falafel_mix_box_397g.jpg|thumb|right|A box of dry Falafel mix containing both fava beans and chick peas]]
Falafel is made from [[Vicia faba|fava bean]]s or [[chickpea|chick peas]] or a combination of the two. The Egyptian variation uses exclusively fava beans, while other variations may only use chick peas. Unlike many other bean patties, in falafel the beans are not cooked prior to use. Instead they are soaked, possibly skinned, then ground with the addition of a small quantity of onion, parsley, spices, bicarbonate of soda and deep fried at a high temperature. Sesame seeds may be added to the balls before they are fried; this is particularly common when falafel is served as a dish in its own right rather than as a sandwich filling.

Recent culinary trends have seen the triumph of the chickpea falafel over the fava bean falafel.  Chickpea falafels are served across the Middle East, and popularized by expatriates of those countries living abroad.

===Topping variations===
There is more than one way to make a falafel sandwich. Outside the Middle East a Greek-style Pita bread used as a pocket and stuffed with the different ingredients; in Arab countries a round 'khubz' bread 'eish' in Egypt, is halved, and the two resulting round pieces are used to create a cigar-shaped wrap. In the Arab countries, [[hummus]] (chickpeas pureed with tahina) is virtually never an ingredient. The usual sauce is tahina (sesame seed paste) let down or thinned with water and lemon. The most common salad ingredients are tomato and parsley. In [[Lebanon]] parsley mixed with chopped mint leaves. It is also virtually mandatory in Syria and Lebanon to add pickles; the two canonical ones are pickled turnip, colored pink with beetroot, and pickled cucumber. Palestinans like to add fried aubergine (eggplant). In [[Lebanon]], and the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]], [[french fries]] are a frequent addition. Recently, there has been a new "filled" falafel, its center usually consisting of ground meat or minced onions. These fillings are wrapped by the uncooked falafel mixture, and then deep fried.

The salads or the pita itself may be seasoned with [[sumac]] or [[salt]]; alternatively, these may be applied to the top. In Syria, sumac is practically a universal accompaniment to falafel, whether in a sandwich or otherwise.

Falafel is becoming an increasingly common sandwich or snack food in the [[United States]]. It is frequently wrongly identified by Americans as a [[Greek]] food, and although it is sometimes more accurately believed to be an [[Israeli]] food, it is rarely associated by Americans as a product of [[Arab]] [[cuisine]].
