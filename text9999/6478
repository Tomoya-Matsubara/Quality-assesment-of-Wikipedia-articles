Jim Stone, son of ''Malahat''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Captain Stuart Stone, interviewed family and acquaintances to learn more about his father's activities during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition Era]] (1920<U+2013>1933). In his book, ''My Dad, The Rum Runner'', Stone determined that the ''Malahat'' could carry up to 100,000 bottles of illegal liquor, of which 40,000 were stowed on deck.<ref name = "jimstone" /> Another source cites a figure of "84,000 cases in the hold plus approximately 16,000 on deck when the ''Ryuo II'' loaded from her, summer 1933."<ref>{{Cite web

Surprisingly, ''Malahat'' managed to smuggle rum for 13 years despite the efforts of the [[U.S. Coast Guard]].<ref name = "jimstone" /> Apparently this was possible in part because Captain Stone's sister-in-law, who lived near [[Jericho Beach]], [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]], received information from "sympathetic coastal vessels" and transmitted coded radio messages to the ship regarding the Coast Guard's whereabouts.<ref name = "jimstone" /> Evasive tactics included dropping burlap bags of sand over the side as a decoy, and marking the site as a cache of liquor, in order to distract the Coast Guard's attention while the ship sailed off to another location.<ref name = "gibbs" />

One practical commentary on the ''Malahat''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s career says:
{{quote|
JG: The Malahat looks like it would have cost a lot of money to keep in operation as a rum-runner.
<p>
TH: Most of its rum-running was pretty sedate in that it steamed up from [[San Francisco]] and threw out the anchor and sat there off the [[Three-mile limit|international limits]].</p>
<p>
Sure it was an expensive boat to maintain but don't forget: A) it wasn't using up a lot of fuel, and B) rum-running was hugely profitable. Just incredible amounts of money.</p>
<p>
Although it's a small chapter in [[History of British Columbia|B.C. history]] it is important in that it kept a lot of seamen and shipyards busy when [[Great Depression in Canada|the economy was truly bust]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Harbour Publishing: Excerpt from Westcoasters |accessdate=2012-01-15 |url=http://www.harbourpublishing.com/excerpt/Westcoasters/webonly/53}}</ref></p>}}

''Malahat'' became a lumber schooner once again after [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] ended. In 1934, [[Gordon Gibson, Sr.]] and his brother were so excited to discover ''Malahat'' up for sale for only $2,500 that they bought her on the spot.<ref name = "douglas">{{Cite book

==Legacy==
The career of the ''Malahat'' has been cited as recently as October 2011, on the floor of the [[House of Commons of Canada|Canadian House of Commons]], by MP [[Randall Garrison]], as an example of potential negative consequences that could result from passing a new law to prohibit transport of wine between provinces for personal use.<ref>
