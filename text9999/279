After speculation of where the game would be played due to the [[California wildfires of October 2007|California wildfires]], it was confirmed on [[October 26]] [[2007]] that Qualcomm Stadium would be discontinued as an evacuation site for San Diego residents (with most the evacuees moved to [[Del Mar]]). Before, sites in the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] area were being considered to host the game, as well as Houston's [[Reliant Stadium]], and also the [[Dallas Cowboys]]' [[Texas Stadium]]. Before the game a special tribute was paid to at the stadium for the fire fighters, National Guard, and volunteers who assisted in fighting the fires and helping the evacuees. Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] attended the game and [[Coin flipping|flipped the coin]], which the Chargers won. With an emotional charge from both the players and fans, as well as some victims, the Chargers played one of the best games of their season. Philip Rivers threw 3 touchdown passes despite only throwing 11 passes. Two TDs went to tight end [[Antonio Gates]], and the remainder went to newly acquired wideout [[Chris Chambers]], who was just traded from the [[Miami Dolphins]] a two weeks earlier and played his first game as a Charger (due to San Diego's bye week). However, that performance was second to second-year corner [[Antonio Cromartie]], who performance included two interceptions, and two defensive touchdowns. He had a 70 yard INT return for a score, and the other was a complicated snap where the Texans snapped the ball over punter [[Matt Turk]]'s head, and the ball fell into the end zone. Quickly having to recover, Turk missed grabbing the ball and it fell into the hands of Cromartie, easily scoring. The Chargers won, 35-10 in a home blowout, which was, in the quote of [[Ladainian Tomlinson]], "one for the fans."
