"'''Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish'''" is the fourth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 2)|second season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox network]] in the United States on November 1, 1990. In the episode, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] catches a three-eyed fish in a river downstream of the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]]. This causes the plant to become inspected, and in order to prevent it from being shut down, [[Mr. Burns]] decides to run for governor. After a hard campaign which sees Burns rise from being universally despised to running neck and neck with incumbent [[List of recurring characters from The Simpsons#Mary Bailey|Mary Bailey]], it is decided that Burns will have dinner with a random employee the night before the election. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] is chosen, much to [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]'s chagrin.

The episode was written by [[Sam Simon]] and [[John Swartzwelder]], and directed by [[Wes Archer]]. It was the first episode produced for season two and was intended to air as the season premiere, but was replaced with "[[Bart Gets an F]]" due to Bart's popularity in the early 1990s. The episode features cultural references to several American films, mostly the 1941 film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', with Burns in the role of the character Charles Foster Kane. Mary Bailey shares her name with George Bailey's wife in the 1946 film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''.

Journalists have described the episode as a satire on both [[American politics]] and [[environmentalism]]. It won an [[Environmental Media Awards|Environmental Media Award]] in 1991 for being the best television episode of the year with an environmental message. Since the episode first aired, the three-eyed fish [[List of animals in The Simpsons#Blinky|Blinky]] has been mentioned several times in news articles regarding [[nuclear waste]] and [[mutation]]. The episode was positively received by television critics for its satire on American politics. It acquired a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 15.8, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.

==Plot==
[[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] go fishing downstream of the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]] and ''[[Springfield Shopper]]'' reporter [[List of recurring characters from The Simpsons#Dave Shutton|Dave Shutton]] pulls up just as Bart catches a three-eyed fish, which the media nicknames Blinky. The fish makes headlines and a [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] regulatory committee sends a team to investigate nuclear waste coming from the plant that could have caused the fish to mutate. After the inspection, the plant's owner, [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]], is presented with a list of 342 violations, which would cost US$56 million to rectify. Distraught, Burns talks to plant employee [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], who half-heartedly suggests Burns run for governor so that he could change the standards and prevent the plant from being shut down. Burns pounces on the idea, knowing that he will not have to pay to bring the plant up to code anymore.

Burns's political advisers break the news to Burns that he is greatly despised by many people and force Burns to try being friendly and even smile. Burns makes a television commercial discussing Blinky with an actor portraying [[Charles Darwin]], who claims Blinky is an [[evolution]]ary step and not a mutated fish. Combined with a promise to lower taxes and a [[smear campaign]] against current governor [[List of recurring characters from The Simpsons#Mary Bailey|Mary Bailey]], Burns ties with her in the polls. On the night before the election, Burns's advisers suggest that Burns have dinner at the home of a middle class family as an opportunity to put Burns in the lead. Burns scans his employees for the most average man he can find, and Homer is chosen.

The impending dinner with Burns divides the Simpson household. Homer supports Burns, while [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] and Lisa oppose him. Before the dinner arrives, Burns's advisers prepare the family for the event, even giving them pre-written questions to ask in lieu of conversation. Lisa becomes disillusioned by it all, but Marge tells her not to worry. To everyone's surprise, Marge serves Blinky for dinner. Burns tries to act as if it does not bother him, but is not able to keep from spitting it out. The cameras flash as the bite flies through the air, and by the time the chunk hits the floor the press is gone and his gubernatorial campaign dissolves. Bailey wins the election and, despite Burns saying that Homer's dreams will be unfulfilled for as long as he is alive, the Simpson family happily gets together again.

The episode was written by [[Sam Simon]] and [[John Swartzwelder]], and directed by [[Wes Archer]]. Blinky had previously made a brief appearance in the season one episode "[[Homer's Odyssey (The Simpsons)|Homer's Odyssey]]", in which he was seen swimming in the lake outside of the plant. The writers liked the design of the fish and decided to devote an episode to him.<ref name="Groening">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|date=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Mary Bailey and ''Springfield Shopper'' reporter Dave Shutton made their first appearance on the show in this episode.<ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|isbn=0-00-638898-1|page=43}}</ref> Dave Shutton, voiced by [[Harry Shearer]], was named after a friend of Swartzwelder.

During the first season of ''The Simpsons'', Bart quickly became one of the most popular characters on television in what was termed "[[Bartmania]]".<ref>{{cite news|title=Cartoon leads a revolt against apple-pie family&nbsp;<U+2014> Simpsons|accessdate=2009-04-15|date=1990-07-08|author=Cassidy, John|work=[[The Sunday Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22062437-5009160,00.html|title=Simpsons set for big screen|accessdate=2009-04-15|date=2007-07-15|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D71F3AF93AA15757C0A966958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=4|title=Cashing in on a Hot New Brand Name |author=Kleinfield, N.R.|accessdate=2009-04-15|date=1990-04-29|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> Due to the success of the first season, the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] decided to switch ''The Simpsons''<nowiki>'</nowiki> timeslot in hopes that it would steal ratings from [[NBC]]'s "powerhouse" line up.

==Cultural references==
Several parts of the episode are inspired by the 1941 film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', all with Mr. Burns in the role of Charles Foster Kane.<ref name="Reiss"/> The campaign rally scene where Burns speaks in front of a giant poster of himself is a reference to a scene from that film.<ref name="BBC"/> The scene where Burns trashes the Simpson family's dining room after the dinner is similar to the scene in which Kane destroys his ex-wife's room.<ref name="Jean"/> Mary Bailey shares her name with George Bailey's wife in the 1946 film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''.<ref name="Washington Post "/> Burns hires an actor to portray the nineteenth-century scientist Charles Darwin to help in his claim that the three-eyed fish was the result of evolution. Darwin was a [[natural history|naturalist]] who presented compelling evidence that all species of life have evolved over time from [[common descent|common ancestors]], through the process he called natural selection.<ref>{{cite book |title=On the origin of species by means of natural selection |last= |first= |authorlink= |editor=Carroll, Joseph |year=2003 |publisher=Broadview |location= Peterborough, Ontario|isbn= 1551113376|page=15 |pages= |url= |accessdate= }}</ref> The clip of Burns driving a military tank in his campaign montage is similar to a clip featured in [[Michael Dukakis]]'s [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 United States presidential campaign]], in which he can be seen driving a tank.<ref name="book"/> A re-run of the episode that aired on June 25, 1992, included a new [[chalkboard gag]] in the opening credits that featured Bart writing "It's potato, not potatoe" on the chalkboard. This is a reference to a spelling blunder by the then-[[Vice President of the United States]] [[Dan Quayle]], who corrected a student's correct spelling of "[[potato]]" to "potatoe" at an elementary school [[spelling bee]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], on June 15, 1992.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bart Gives Quayle Some Spelling Tips|date=June 25, 1992 |work=The Record |pages=D16|accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref>

Journalists have described "Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish" as a satire on American politics. Joanne Ostrow, a reviewer for ''[[The Denver Post]]'', said only a cartoon could get away with "such pointed satire" of American political campaigning and advertising that is featured in the episode. She compared it to the "counter-cultural posture" television shows such as ''[[Second City Television]]'' and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' took in the mid-1970s: "In those days, this sort of alternative viewpoint was kept out of prime time. [In ''The Simpsons'' case], it's still relegated to the (distant) fourth network, but at least the time is prime."<ref>{{cite news|title=Family lifestyles poles apart in `Simpsons' vs. `Cosby'|last=Ostrow|first=Joanne|date=October 10, 1990 |work=The Denver Post|pages=1F|accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref> Jeremy Kleinman of [[DVD Talk]] wrote: "The writers of ''The Simpsons'' have often come across as unabashedly liberal and this episode is no exception as political/social commentary takes a step closer to the foreground during this episode."<ref name="dvdtalk"/> [[Al Jean]], current [[show runner]] of ''The Simpsons'', has himself admitted in an interview that the show is of "liberal bent".<ref name="turner223">{{cite book | last=Turner | first=Chris | title=[[Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation]] |publisher=Random House of Canada |page=223|isbn=0-679-31318-4}}</ref> In the [[Audio commentary|DVD commentaries]], creator [[Matt Groening]] and the majority of people who work on the show state several times that they are very liberal, but some, such as [[John Swartzwelder]] (the writer of many ''The Simpsons'' episodes), are conservative. The show portrays government and large corporations as callous entities that take advantage of the common worker.<ref name="turner223"/> Thus, the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light. In ''The Simpsons'', politicians are corrupt, ministers such as [[Reverend Lovejoy]] are indifferent to churchgoers, and the local police force is incompetent.<ref>{{cite book | last=Turner | first=Chris | title=[[Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation]] |publisher=Random House of Canada |page=56|isbn=0-679-31318-4}}</ref>

The episode also features an environmentalism theme. This theme is present in the nuclear power plant's polluting of Lake Springfield, which causes the fish of the lake to become mutated. [[University of the Sciences in Philadelphia]] [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] professor Paul Halpern discuss the episode in his book ''What's Science Ever Done for Us?: What the Simpsons Can Teach Us About Physics, Robots, Life, and the Universe''. He comments: "Considering the fact that [Charles Darwin's theory of] [[natural selection]] takes generations and that successful varieties must sustain a [[Survival of the fittest|survival advantage]] over others, the only way Mr. Burns can prove his assertion [that the fish is the next step in evolution through natural selection] is by tracking Blinky over time to see if the third eye allows the mutant fish to find food more quickly or dodge predators."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/the-simpsons/the-simpsons-can-be-used-to-te-9848.aspx|title='The Simpsons' Can be Used to Teach Science|last=Claustro|first=Lisa|date=August 26, 2007 |publisher=BuddyTV|accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=3472838&page=1|title='The Simpsons'?

Japp discuss the environmental theme of the episode in their book ''Enviropop: Studies in Environmental Rhetoric and Popular Culture''. The authors think human pollution is characterized in the episode as an improvement on nature, and human progress is viewed as an "integral" part of human evolution. They add: "These references articulate specific criticism of current environmental regulations, specifically the lax enforcement of the regulations concerning the dumping, safe storage, and disposal of nuclear waste. Furthermore, this episode condemns the manipulation of political and economic power to disguise ecological accountability and to shift blame for environmental problems."<ref name="enviropop"/> The authors also say the episode comments on the lack of adherence to safety standards for the plant, and criticizes the "apathetic acceptance" of unforced environmental inspections. In addition, they comment that the episode "explicitly criticizes media [[Spin (public relations)|spin-doctor]]s who distort the impacts of ecological degradation caused by wealthy corporations such as the nuclear power plant."<ref name="enviropop">{{cite book|last=Meister |first=Mark|coauthors=Phyllis|others=Japp|title=Enviropop: Studies in Environmental Rhetoric and Popular Culture|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|date=2002|pages=72|chapter=The Simpsons|isbn=9780275969288}}</ref>

On February 13, 1991, a local group in [[Albany, New York]], fought the government's plan to create a nuclear waste dump in their neighborhood. It was staged by Citizens Against Radioactive Dumping (CARD) at the monthly meeting of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Siting Commission in Albany. Here four children dressed up as Homer, Marge, Bart, and Lisa, and presented a three-eyed fabric fish, which looked like Blinky, to the commission. In addition to that they performed a rap song, which explained the plot of the episode.<ref name="nuclear">{{cite news |first=Thomas |last=Fine|coauthors= |title=Cartoon heroes animate protest - Simpson look-alikes featured in fanzine feature|work=Syracuse Herald American (NY) |page=C1 |date=1992-01-12|accessdate=2009-03-02}}</ref>

Since the episode's initial airing, Blinky has been mentioned several times in news articles regarding nuclear waste and mutation. A reporter for the ''[[Lincoln Journal Star]]'' compared Blinky to a [[rainbow trout]] with two mouths caught in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2005/12/21/top_story/extras/doc43a8a41f9e573446927890.txt|title=A fish with two mouths?|last=Laukaitis|first=Algis|date=December 22, 2005|work=Lincoln Journal Star|accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref> The fish was mentioned in an ''[[National Review]]'' article discussing a [[legislation]] which would make it illegal to import, possess or release alive into California any live [[transgenic]] fish: "Sounds like someone watched one too many episodes of ''The Simpsons'' with Blinky, the three-eyed fish that swims by the nuclear-power plant."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-whalen060602.asp|title=California Daydreaming|last=Whalen|first=Bill|date=June 6, 2002|work=National Review|accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref> Matt Smith of ''[[SF Weekly]]'' compared Blinky to a type of fish found in [[San Francisco Bay]], which, according to a study by the [[University of California, Davis]], had a shrunken brain and misshapen body that had been caused by the dumping of toxic chemicals into the bay.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2009/01/science_is_blinky_the_simpsons.php|title=Is Blinky, The Simpsons' Three-Eyed Fish, Headed For San Francisco?|last=Smith|first=Matt|date=January 13, 2009 |work=SF Gate|accessdate=2009-05-27}}</ref> In an article about the now closed nuclear weapons production facility [[Rocky Flats Plant]], Brian Park of ''[[Rocky Mountain Collegian|The Rocky Mountain Collegian]]'' joked that after its closure, "years of clean up ensued and now the area is a wildlife refuge; no word yet if Blinky has been spotted."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://media.www.collegian.com/media/storage/paper864/news/2007/08/30/Opinion/quality.Of.Life.Is.A.Popular.Term.In.Colorado-2943357.shtml|title="Quality of life" is a popular term in Colorado|last=Park|first=Brian|date=August 30, 2007|work=The Rocky Mountain Collegian|accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref> Barbara Taormina of the ''[[North Shore Weeklies|North Shore Sunday]]'' wrote in her article about the new [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) pipeline in [[Massachusetts Bay]]: "Will Blinky, the mutant three-eyed fish from ''The Simpsons'' be showing up in Massachusetts Bay?

==Reception==
In its original broadcast, "Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish" finished nineteenth in the ratings for the week of October 29<U+2013>November 4, 1990, with a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 15.8, equivalent to approximately 14.7 million viewing households. ''The Simpsons'' was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, but was beaten by ''The Cosby Show'' which got a 20.2 rating.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nielsen Ratings /Oct. 29-Nov. 4|date=November 7, 1990  |work=Long Beach Press-Telegram|pages=C12|accessdate=2009-05-23}}</ref> The episode won an [[Environmental Media Awards|Environmental Media Award]] in the "Best Television Episodic Comedy" category,<ref name="EMAIMDB">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697/awards|title=Awards for "The Simpsons"|accessdate=2007-10-17|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref> which has been awarded every year since 1991 to the best television episode with an environmental message.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ema-online.org/awards.php#TurnerAward|title=The EMA Awards|accessdate=2007-10-17|publisher=Environmental Media Awards}}</ref> It was ''The Simpsons'' first Environmental Media Award, but the show has won six more since then.<ref name="EMAIMDB"/>

The episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics since airing. The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called the episode a "superb example" of political satire, "demonstrating the lengths people will go to to win votes. Marge, of course, sees straight through Burns and uses Blinky the three-eyed fish to demonstrate his lack of conviction."<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season2/page4.shtml|title=Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish|accessdate=2009-05-12|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |date=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref> Phil Rosenthal of the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'' called the episode a "wonderful stab" at American politics and the "media machine that drives it", and added: "The message is so subtle, the makers of ''The Simpsons'' might deny it is there at all for fear of turning off a portion of its audience.

Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' contributor, thought the episode's story was "nicely composed, so you don't have to recognize the ''Citizen Kane'' references to appreciate the effort, but it adds to the fun."<ref name="pratt"/> He also noted that it begins the exploration of Mr. Burns "in earnest, the first of many characters who will receive elaborate coverage as the series advances."<ref name="pratt">{{Cite book |last=Pratt |first=Doug |title= Doug Pratt's DVD: Movies, Television, Music, Art, Adult, and More! |year=2005 |publisher=UNET 2 Corporation |isbn= 1932916016 |page=1094}}</ref> Jeremy Kleinman of [[DVD Talk]] thought both Lisa's "tremendous intellect" and Marge's "moral compass" were "probed" in the episode, and he thought one "clear highlight" of the episode was Burns's attempts to explain away Blinky's mutation by turning to an actor portraying Charles Darwin who proceeds to give a speech suggesting that Blinky is merely advanced.<ref name="dvdtalk">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/4308/simpsons-the-complete-second-season-the/|title=The Simpsons - The Complete Second Season|last=Kleinman |first=Jeremy|date=August 1, 2002|publisher=[[DVD Talk]]|accessdate=2009-03-23}}</ref> DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: "The episode took an unusual approach for an early show, as it focused largely on a secondary character. One could argue that season one<U+2019>s '[[Krusty Gets Busted]]' did the same, but 'Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish' provided a heavier emphasis on Burns than that prior program did [[Krusty]].
