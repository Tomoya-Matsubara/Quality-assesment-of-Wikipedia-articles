The '''1996 Football League Second Division play-off Final''' was a [[association football|football]] match played at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] on 26 May 1996, at the end of the [[1995<U+2013>96 in English football|1995<U+2013>96 English league season]] to determine the final [[promotion and relegation|promoted]] side from the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] beat [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] 2<U+2013>0 to join [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] and [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] in winning promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. It was the 10th [[Football League One play-offs|Second Division play-off Final]] and the seventh to be held at Wembley.

For Bradford, it was the first time they had played at Wembley in their [[History of Bradford City A.F.C.|93-year history]]. City finished sixth during the regular league season only winning a play-off place with a victory on the final day of the season. They came from two goals down during the semi-finals to gain a place in the play-off final. Having been relegated the previous season, Notts County had the chance to win an instant promotion back to the First Division. They finished fourth during the regular season and defeated [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] in the semi-final by drawing the away tie and winning by one-goal in the second leg at home.

Bradford took an eighth minute lead in the final through 19-year-old [[Bradford]]-born [[Des Hamilton]]. Notts County only had one chance in the first half before applying more pressure during the early part of the second half. However Bradford's recent signing [[Mark Stallard]] doubled their lead to give them victory and newspaper reporters agreed that Bradford dominated the game. Their manager [[Chris Kamara]] had only been in charge for six months before the final. Three years after their victory, Bradford went on to win promotion to the [[Premier League]]; their opponents Notts County were relegated the season after their play-off final defeat and have yet to finish higher since their fourth place finish in 1996.

==Match summary==
===Pre-match===
City had only appeared in one previous major final when they won the [[1911 FA Cup Final]] before [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] had been built. Hence, the play-off final was the club's first game at Wembley in their [[History of Bradford City A.F.C.|93-year history]].<ref name="sun"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Markham |first=David |title=The legends of Bradford City |publisher=Breedon Books Sport |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-85983-572-2 |page=103}}</ref> For Notts County, it was the fifth visit to the national stadium since 1990.<ref name="independent"/> The historic occasion for Bradford was reflected in the ticket sales, with City fans outnumbering their opponents nearly three-to-one with 28,000 of the crowd of 39,972 coming from Bradford.<ref name="independent"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Going up |date=1996-05-27 |newspaper=Yorkshire Post |page=1}}</ref>

Kamara's main selection dilemma was in attack where he had to pick a strike partner for Stallard, a player who had joined from [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in January for <U+00A3>120,000 and gone on to score ten goals. Kamara opted for Shutt, who was given only a 50 per cent of playing in the run-up to the match because of a slight knock,<ref>{{cite news |title=Bradford on an upswing |publisher=''The Guardian'' |first=David |last=Hopps |date=1996-05-25}}</ref> with [[Ian Ormondroyd]], a veteran of three play-off finals with his previous club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Markham |title=The legends of Bradford City |page=147}}</ref> selected as substitute.<ref name="independent"/> Captain [[Eddie Youds]], who overcame a knee problem to return to the side in defence in place of [[David Brightwell]], was the only player not to have played in the second leg against Blackpool.<ref name="yorkshire post">{{cite news |title=Ormondroyd times arrival to perfection |date=1996-05-27 |newspaper=Yorkshire Post |page=B10}}</ref> Notts County's side featured only two of the players that had been relegated the previous season &ndash; [[Tony Agana]] and [[Shaun Murphy (footballer)|Shaun Murphy]].

===Post-match reaction===
In his match report for ''The Independent'', Tim Collings wrote that City "played with a width, verve and pace which embarrassed County" and called it "a professional job by a spirited and swift team".<ref name="independent"/> ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'''s report said that City had "cruised to victory".<ref name="sun"/> The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported that County had struggled until the second half with their best chance limited to one from 25 yards from goal.<ref name="Des-troyer">{{cite news |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DES-TROYER%3b+Home-grown+Hammy+is+toast+of+Bradford.-a061320588 |title=Des-troyer: Home-grown Hammy is toast of Bradford |publisher=''Daily Mirror'' |date=1996-05-27 |accessdate=2010-09-03}}</ref> Trevor Haylett, ''[[The Guardian]]'' match reporter, called it an uneven contest, with Bradford never looking back from their early goal. He added Hamilton and Kiwomya, City's two wingers, maintained their side's momentum. Haylett reported that County played as a "team of strangers" during the first half.<ref name="guardian"/> Bradford's daily newspaper the ''[[Telegraph & Argus]]'' reported that "apart from a 15-minute spell midway through the second half when Notts came close to equalising, City were in complete charge of the game".<ref>{{Cite news |title=Dream come true |newspaper=Telegraph & Argus |date=1996-05-27 |first=David |last=Markham |page=3a}}</ref>

City's matchwinner Hamilton and his manager Kamara shared the headlines in the national newspapers.<ref name="sun"/><ref name="special k"/><ref name="independent"/><ref name="guardian"/><ref name="Des-troyer"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Hamilton goes on home run to glory |publisher=''Daily Express'' |date=1996-05-27 |page=26}}</ref> Hamilton said after the game: "To score for my hometown team at Wembley has got to be one of the best feelings ever." Kamara added: "Now I am hungry for second helpings of success. And I am absolutely convinced I can get it here. We will not look out of place in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] because we have so much quality." County's manager [[Colin Murphy (footballer)|Colin Murphy]] told the press: "All credit to Bradford, they won it fair and square. And that does not always happen in football. Bradford are a very experienced side compared to mine. Maybe this came a year too early for my boys."<ref name="sun"/> Jacobs, the Bradford full-back who played 11 years for the club and won a subsequent promotion to the Premier League, said after his career: "I just look back on some amazing times and I was delighted to be part of them. It was a real blessing to my life. To play at Wembley was a dream fulfilled."<ref name="markham"/>

The day after the final, City held an open top bus tour and a civic reception at [[Bradford City Hall]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/1999/5/13/163164.html |title=Season to be cheerful |date=1999-05-13 |accessdate=2010-09-07 |publisher=''Telegraph & Argus''}}</ref> The following day, they hosted a friendly match against Dutch side [[Feyenoord]] to celebrate their victory.<ref name="special k"/>

==Aftermath==
The following season, City's fate once again went down to the final game of the season. A 3<U+2013>0 victory against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] ensured they avoided being relegated immediately back to the Second Division. Instead [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] went down alongside [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] and [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/league2.sd?seasonid=126&competitionid=2 |title=Final 1996/1997 Football League Championship Table |accessdate=2010-09-02 |publisher=Soccerbase}}</ref> In January 1998, Richmond sacked Kamara<ref>{{cite news

Notts County's fate went in the opposite direction. They were relegated in bottom place the season after the 1996 play-off final defeat,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/league2.sd?seasonid=126&competitionid=3 |title=Final 1996/1997 Football League One Table |accessdate=2010-09-02 |publisher=Soccerbase}}</ref> only to win the 1997<U+2013>98 Third Division title and gain instant promotion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/league2.sd?seasonid=127&competitionid=4 |title=Final 1997/1998 Football League Two Table |accessdate=2010-09-02 |publisher=Soccerbase}}</ref> However, they have spent every season since in the bottom two divisions. The two clubs did not meet again in league football until January 2008 after City's fall back down the league structure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/head2.sd?team2id=234&team1id=1871 |title=All time results between Notts County and Bradford City |accessdate=2010-09-09 |publisher=Soccerbase}}</ref>

Blackpool, whom Bradford had defeated in the play-off semi-final, were relegated to the bottom tier in 1999<U+2013>2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/league2.sd?seasonid=129&competitionid=2 |title=Final 1999/2000 Football League One Table |accessdate=2010-09-02 |publisher=Soccerbase}}</ref> They won three promotions <U+2013> all via the play-offs<ref>{{cite web |url=http://premierskills.britishcouncil.org/the-clubs/blackpool-back-at-the-top |title=Blackpool back at the top |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=2010-09-02}}</ref> <U+2013> within the following decade to reach the Premier League themselves for the first time in their history.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/football_league/article7133840.ece |title=Blackpool reach promised land |first=Andrew |last=Longmore |date=2010-05-23 |accessdate=2010-09-02 |publisher=''The Sunday Times''}}</ref>
