She later recalled her time as a student at [[Beverly Hills High School]] (later Moreno High School), and her feeling of isolation among the children of some of the area's more affluent families. Jolie's mother survived on a more modest income, and Jolie often wore second-hand clothes. She was teased by other students who also targeted her for her distinctive features, for being extremely thin, and for wearing glasses and [[dental braces|braces]].<ref name="Angelina Jolie Biography"/> Her self esteem was further diminished when her initial attempts at modeling proved unsuccessful.

Jolie has been long estranged from her father, though a reconciliation was attempted, and he appeared with her in ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]''. In July 2002, Jolie filed a request to legally change her name to "Angelina Jolie", dropping Voight as her surname; the name change was made official on [[September 12]], [[2002]].<ref name="Angelina Jolie's Name Interrupted">Grossberg, Josh.

===Early work, 1993<U+2013>1997===
Jolie began working as a [[Model (person)|fashion model]] at 14. She was signed with [[Finesse Model Management]] and modeled in both the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], working mainly in [[Los Angeles]], [[New York]] and [[London]]. At that time she also appeared in numerous [[music videos]], including those of [[Meat Loaf]] ("Rock & Roll Dreams Come Through"), [[Antonello Venditti]] ("Alta Marea"), [[Lenny Kravitz]] ("Stand by My Woman"), and [[The Lemonheads]] ("It's About Time"). At the age of 16, Jolie returned to theatre, and played her first role as a German [[dominatrix]]. She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them.  Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both "drama queens".<ref name="Angelina Jolie Biography"/>

Jolie appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]], but her professional movie career began in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the [[low budget film]] ''[[Cyborg 2]]'', as Casella "Cash" Reese, a near-human [[robot]], designed to seduce her way into a rival manufacturer's headquarters and then self-detonate. Following several undistinguished projects she starred as Kate "Acid Burn" Libby in her first [[Hollywood]] picture, ''[[Hackers (film)|Hackers]]'' (1995),  where she met her first husband [[Jonny Lee Miller]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "Kate (Angelina Jolie) stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top. Despite her sullen posturing, which is all this role requires, Ms. Jolie has the sweetly cherubic looks of her father, Jon Voight."<ref>Maslin, Janet.

She appeared as Gina Malacici in the 1996 comedy ''[[Love Is All There Is]]'', a modern-day loose adaptation of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' set among two rival Italian family restaurant owners in the Bronx, New York. In the [[road movie]] ''[[Mojave Moon]]'' she was a youngster, named Eleanor Rigby, who falls for [[Danny Aiello]], while he takes a shine to her mother, [[Anne Archer]]. In 1996, she also played Margret "Legs" Sadovsky, one of five teenage girls who form an unlikely bond in the film ''[[Foxfire (1996 film)|Foxfire]]'' after they beat up a teacher who has [[sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] them. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote about Jolie's performance, "It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst."<ref>Mathews, Jack. [http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie961028-38,0,1420921.story Movie Review - Foxfire]. ''The Los Angeles Times''. August 23, 1996. Accessed April 14, 2007.</ref>

In 1997, Jolie starred with [[David Duchovny]] in the thriller ''[[Playing God]]'', a film portraying a surgeon who is stripped of his medical license and is lured deep into the criminal world where he meets Jolie<U+2019>s character, Claire. The movie was not received well by critics and [[Roger Ebert]] noted that "Angelina Jolie finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be [a criminal's] girlfriend, and maybe she is."<ref>Ebert, Roger. [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19971017/REVIEWS/710170306/1023 Reviews: Playing God]. ''Chicago Sun-Times''. October 17, 1997. Accessed April 14, 2007.</ref>  She then appeared in the [[TV movie]] ''[[True Women]]'', a historical romantic drama set in the [[American Old West|West]], and based on the book by [[Janice Woods Windle]]. That year she also played a stripper in the [[Rolling Stones]] music video for the song "[[Anybody Seen My Baby?]]"

===Breakthrough, 1997<U+2013>2000===
Jolie's career prospects began to improve after her performance as Cornelia Wallace in the 1997 [[biopic]] ''[[George Wallace (film)|George Wallace]]'' for which she won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for an [[Emmy]]. The film was highly praised by [[critics]] and, among other awards, received the Golden Globe for Best Miniseries/Motion Picture made for TV. She played the second wife of the segregationist Governor of Alabama who was shot and paralyzed while running for President. The film starred [[Gary Sinise]] and was directed by [[John Frankenheimer]].

In 1998, Jolie starred in [[HBO]]'s ''[[Gia]]'' as [[supermodel]] [[Gia Carangi]].  The film depicted a world of sex, drugs and emotional drama, and chronicled the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her drug addiction, and her decline and death from [[AIDS]].  Vanessa Vance from ''Reel.com'' noted, "Angelina Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why.  Jolie is fierce in her portrayal &mdash; filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation &mdash; and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed."<ref>Vance, Vanessa.

In accordance with [[Lee Strasberg|Lee Strasberg's]] [[method acting]] Jolie reportedly preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting ''Gia'', she told her then-husband [[Jonny Lee Miller]] that she wouldn't be able to phone him. "I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm [[gay]]; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'"<ref name="Angelina Jolie interviews featuring Jonny Lee Miller">[http://www.jonnyleemiller.co.uk/angelinajolie.html Angelina Jolie interviews featuring Jonny Lee Miller]. ''JonnyLeeMiller.co.uk''. Accessed April 14, 2007.</ref>

Following ''Gia'', Jolie moved to [[New York]] and stopped acting for a short period of time, because she felt that she had "nothing else to give". She enrolled at [[New York University]] to study filmmaking and attended writing classes. She described it as "just good for me to collect myself" on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]''.<ref name="Inside the Actors Studio">[http://www.tv.com/inside-the-actors-studio/angelina-jolie/episode/425020/summary.html?tag=ep_list;title;15 Inside the Actors Studio, Episode 169].

Jolie returned to film as Gloria McNeary in the 1998 gangster movie ''[[Hell's Kitchen (1998 film)|Hell's Kitchen]]'',  and later that year appeared in in ''[[Playing by Heart]]'', part of an ensemble cast that included [[Sean Connery]], [[Gillian Anderson]], [[Ryan Phillippe]] and [[Jon Stewart]]. The film received predominantly positive reviews and Jolie was praised in particular. The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote, "Jolie, working through an overwritten part, is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she's willing to gamble."<ref>Stack, Peter.

In 1999, she starred in [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell's]] comedy-drama ''[[Pushing Tin]]'', co-starring [[John Cusack]], [[Billy Bob Thornton]], and [[Cate Blanchett]]. Jolie played Thornton's seductive wife. The film received a lukewarm reception from critics and Jolie's character was particularly criticized. The ''[[Washington Post]]'' wrote, "Mary (Angelina Jolie), a completely ludicrous writer's creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over [[hibiscus]] plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home."<ref>Howe, Desson.

Jolie played Amelia Donaghy, a police officer haunted by her cop father's [[suicide]], who reluctantly helps Washington track down a [[serial killer]]. The movie grossed $151 million worldwide,<ref name="Angelina Jolie Movie Box Office Results"/> but was a critical failure; the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' concluded, "Jolie, while always delicious to look at, is simply and woefully miscast."<ref>Lawson, Terry.

Jolie next took the supporting role of the [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] Lisa Rowe in ''[[Girl, Interrupted (film)|Girl, Interrupted]]'' (1999), a film that tells the story of mental patient [[Susanna Kaysen]], and which was adapted from Kaysen's original memoir ''[[Girl, Interrupted]]''. While [[Winona Ryder]] played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, the film instead became the "welcome-to-[[Hollywood]] coronation" for Jolie.<ref>[http://imdb.com/MotDArchive/2003/motd.20030307 IMDb Movie of the Day].

In 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], ''[[Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000 film)|Gone In 60 Seconds]]'', in which she played Sarah "Sway" Wayland, ex-girlfriend of car-thief [[Nicolas Cage]].  The role was small, and the ''[[Washington Post]]'' criticized that "all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth."<ref>Hunter, Stephen.

===International success, 2001<U+2013>present===
Although highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie's films to date had often not appealed to a wide audience, but ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]'' (2001) made her an international [[superstar]]. An adaptation of the popular ''[[Tomb Raider Series|Tomb Raider]] '' [[videogame]], Jolie was required to master a British accent and undergo extensive [[martial arts]] training to play the title role of [[Lara Croft]].  She was generally praised for her physical performance, but the movie generated mostly negative reviews. ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' commented, "Angelina Jolie was born to play Lara Croft but [director] [[Simon West]] makes her journey into a game of [[Frogger]]."<ref>Gonzalez, Ed.

Jolie then starred alongside [[Antonio Banderas]] as the mail-order bride Julia Russell in ''[[Original Sin (film)|Original Sin]]'', a thriller based on the novel ''Waltz into Darkness'' by [[Cornell Woolrich]]. The film was a major critical failure, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' noting, "The story plunges more precipitously than Ms. Jolie's neckline."<ref>Mitchell, Elvis.

The film was poorly received by critics, though Jolie's performance received positive reviews. [[CNN]]'s [[Paul Clinton]] wrote, "Jolie is excellent in her role.

Jolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in ''[[Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life]]'' in 2003. The [[sequel]], while not as lucrative as the original, earned $156 million at the international box-office.<ref name="Angelina Jolie Movie Box Office Results"/> Later that year Jolie starred in ''[[Beyond Borders]]'', a film about [[aid workers]] in Africa. Although reflecting Jolie's real-life interest in promoting humanitarian relief, the film was critically and financially unsuccessful. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, "Jolie, as she did in her Oscar-winning role in ''Girl, Interrupted'', can bring electricity and believability to roles that have a reality she can understand. She can also, witness the ''Lara Croft'' films, do acknowledged cartoons.

===Relationships===
On [[March 28]], [[1996]], Jolie married [[United Kingdom|British]] actor [[Jonny Lee Miller]], her co-star in the film ''[[Hackers (movie)|Hackers]]''. She attended her wedding in black leather pants and a white shirt, upon which she had written the groom's name in her blood.<ref name="News for Angelina Jolie"/> Jolie and Miller separated the following year and subsequently divorced on [[February 3]], [[1999]]. They remained on good terms and Jolie later explained, "It comes down to timing. I think he's the greatest husband a girl could ask for. I'll always love him, we were simply too young."<ref name="Angelina Jolie interviews featuring Jonny Lee Miller"/>

She then married [[United States|American]] actor [[Billy Bob Thornton]], whom she had met on the set of ''[[Pushing Tin]]'', on [[May 5]], [[2000]]. As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love (most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks), their relationship became a favorite topic of the entertainment media.<ref name="News for Angelina Jolie"/> Jolie and Thornton divorced on [[May 27]], [[2003]]. Asked in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, "It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed.

In early 2005, Jolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of being the "other woman" in the divorce of actors [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Jennifer Aniston]]. The allegation was that she and Pitt had started an [[affair]] during filming of ''[[Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. & Mrs. Smith]]''; however, she has denied this in several interviews. In an interview in 2005, she explained, "To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife."<ref name="Angelina, saint vs. sinner"/>

While Jolie and Pitt never publicly commented on the nature of their relationship, speculations continued throughout 2005. The first intimate [[paparazzi]] photos emerged in April, one month after Aniston had filed for divorce; they showed Pitt, Jolie and her son Maddox at a beach in [[Kenya]]. During the summer Jolie and Pitt were seen together with increasing frequency and most of the entertainment media considered them a couple, dubbing them "Brangelina". On [[January 11]], [[2006]] Jolie confirmed to ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' that she was pregnant with Pitt's child and thereby confirmed their relationship for the first time in public.<ref name="News for Angelina Jolie"/>

===Children===

Jolie decided to apply for adoption after she had visited Cambodia twice, while filming ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider|Tomb Raider]]'' and on a [[UNHCR]] field trip in 2001. After her divorce from her second husband, [[Billy Bob Thornton]], Jolie received sole custody of Maddox.

=== Jolie in the media ===

[[Image:Angelina jolie lugar.jpg|thumb|160px|Jolie at a photo op in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

Jolie appeared in the media from an early age due to her famous father [[Jon Voight]]. At seven she had a small part in ''[[Lookin' to Get Out]]'', a movie co-written by and starring her father, and in 1986 and 1988 she attended the [[Academy Awards]] as a teenager with him. However, when she started her acting career, Jolie decided not to use <U+201C>Voight<U+201D> as a stage name, because she wished to establish her own identity as an actress.<ref name="News for Angelina Jolie"/> Jolie was never shy about controversy and integrated her teenage "wild girl" image into her public persona in the first years of her career. During her acceptance speech at the [[72nd Academy Awards|2000 Academy Awards]], Jolie declared, "I'm so in love with my brother right now", which, combined with her affectionate behavior towards him that night, sparked speculation in the tabloid media of an incestuous relationship with her brother [[James Haven]]. She has denied those rumors vehemently, and Jolie and Haven later explained in interviews that after their parents' divorce they relied on one another and because of that they hold on to each other as a means of emotional support.<ref name="News for Angelina Jolie"/> 

Jolie is noted as "the one [[A-list]] celebrity without a [[publicist]]",<ref name="Angelina, saint vs. sinner"/> and she quickly became a tabloid's favorite, since she presented herself as very outspoken in interviews, discussing her love life and her interest in [[BDSM]] openly,<ref name="Wild at heart"/> and once claiming to be "most likely to sleep with a female fan".<ref name="Angelina, saint vs. sinner"/> As one of her most distinctive physical features, Jolie's lips have attracted notable media attention and she has been described as "the current gold standard of beauty in the West" among women seeking cosmetic surgery.<ref>AAP.

===Tattoos===
Jolie's inventory of [[tattoos]] has become the subject of much media attention and has often been addressed by interviewers. Jolie stated that, while she is not opposed to film nudity, the large number of tattoos on her body has forced filmmakers to become more creative when planning nude or love scenes.<ref>Kirkland, Bruce. [http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/J/Jolie_Angelina/2003/10/19/759420.html The new Angelina Jolie]. ''Jam! Showbiz''. October 19, 2003. Accessed April 14, 2007.</ref> Make-up has been used to cover up the tattoos in many of her productions. Jolie currently has 13 known tattoos, among them the [[Tennessee Williams]] quote "A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages", which she got together with her mother, the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] phrase "<U+0627><U+0644><U+0639><U+0632><U+064A><U+0645><U+0629>" (strength of will), the [[Latin]] proverb "quod me nutrit me destruit" (what nourishes me destroys me),<ref>Thomas, Karen.
