'''Trepanning''', also known as '''trephination''', '''trephining''' or making a '''burr hole''', is a medical intervention in which a hole is [[drill]]ed or scraped into the [[human skull]], exposing the ''[[dura mater]]'' in order to treat health problems related to intracranial diseases. It may also refer to any "burr" hole created through other body surfaces, including nail beds.  It is often used to relieve pressure beneath a surface.  A [[trephine]] is an instrument used for cutting out a round piece of skull bone.

Evidence of trepanation has been found in prehistoric human remains from [[Neolithic]] times onwards. Cave paintings indicate that people believed the practice would cure [[epileptic]] seizures, [[migraines]], and mental disorders.<ref>{{cite book |author=Brothwell, Don R. |year=1963 |title=Digging up Bones; the Excavation, Treatment and Study of Human Skeletal Remains |location=London |publisher=British Museum (Natural History) |oclc=14615536 |pages=126}}</ref> The bone that was trepanned was kept by the prehistoric people and probably worn as a charm to keep evil spirits away.  Evidence also suggests that trepanation was primitive emergency surgery after head wounds<ref name=Weber/> to remove shattered bits of bone from a fractured skull and clean out the blood that often pools under the skull after a blow to the head.  Such injuries were typical for primitive weaponry such as [[Sling (weapon)|slings]] and war clubs.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20010202194200/%68ttp://www.trepanation.com/master10.htm The Skull Doctors - www.trepanation.com]</ref> 

There is some contemporary use of the term.  In modern eye surgery a trephine instrument is used in [[Cornea transplant|corneal transplant surgery]]. The procedure of drilling a hole through a fingernail or toenail is also known as trephination. It is performed by a physician or surgeon to relieve the pain associated with a [[subungual hematoma]] (blood under the nail); a small amount of blood is expressed through the hole and the pain associated with the pressure is partially alleviated.

===Prehistoric evidence===
Trepanation is perhaps the oldest surgical procedure for which there is forensic evidence,<ref>{{Cite book |author=Capasso, Luigi |year=2002 |title=Principi di storia della patologia umana: corso di storia della medicina per gli studenti della Facolt<U+00E0> di medicina e chirurgia e della Facolt<U+00E0> di scienze infermieristiche |location=Rome |publisher=SEU |isbn=8887753652 |oclc=50485765 |language=Italian}}</ref> and in some areas may have been quite widespread. Out of 120 prehistoric skulls found at one burial site in [[France]] dated to 6500 BC, 40 had trepanation holes.<ref name="restak2000">{{cite book |author=Restak, Richard|chapter=Fixing the Brain |title=Mysteries of the Mind |publisher=National Geographic Society |location=Washington, D.C. |year=2000 |isbn=0-792-27941-7 |oclc=43662032}}</ref> Many prehistoric and premodern patients had signs of their skull structure healing; suggesting that many of those subjected to the surgery survived.

===Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica===
{{main|Trepanation in Mesoamerica}}
In [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], evidence for the practice of trepanation and an assortment of other [[Human cranium|cranial]] deformation techniques comes from a variety of sources, including physical cranial remains of pre-Columbian burials, allusions in iconographic artworks and reports from the post-colonial period. 

Among [[New World]] societies, trepanning is most commonly found in the [[Andes|Andean]] civilizations such as the pre-[[Incan Empire|Incan]] culture such as the Paracas [[Paracas|Ica]] situated in what now is Ica located South of Lima. Its prevalence among Mesoamerican civilizations is much lower, at least judging from the comparatively few trepanated crania that have been uncovered.<ref name="tiesler2003a">{{Cite paper|author=Tiesler Blos, Vera|date=2003 |title=Cranial Surgery in Ancient Mesoamerica |publisher=Mesoweb |url=http://www.mesoweb.com/features/tiesler/Cranial.pdf |format=[[PDF]]|accessdate=2006-05-23}}</ref>

The [[archaeological record]] in Mesoamerica is further complicated by the practice of skull mutilation and modification carried out ''after'' the death of the subject, to fashion "trophy skulls" and the like of captives and enemies.  This was a widespread tradition, illustrated in pre-Columbian art that occasionally depicts rulers adorned with or carrying the modified skulls of their defeated enemies, or of the ritualistic display of [[human sacrifice|sacrificial]] victims. Several Mesoamerican cultures used a skull-rack (known by its [[Classical Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] term, ''[[tzompantli]]'' ), on which skulls were impaled in rows or columns of wooden stakes. Even so, some evidence of genuine trepanation in Mesoamerica (i.e., where the subject was living) has survived.

The earliest archaeological survey published of trepanated crania was a late 19th-century study of several specimens recovered from the [[Tarahumara]] mountains by the Norwegian [[ethnographer]] [[Carl Sofus Lumholtz|Carl Lumholtz]].<ref name="tiesler2003a" /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lumholtz, Carl |authorlink=Carl Sofus Lumholtz|title=Trephining in Mexico |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=389 |year=1897 |doi=10.1525/aa.1897.10.12.02a00010}}</ref> Later studies documented cases identified from a range of sites in [[Oaxaca]] and central [[Mexico]], such as [[Tilantongo]], Oaxaca and the major [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] site of [[Monte Alb<U+00E1>n]]. Two specimens from the [[Tlatilco]] civilization's homelands (which flourished around 1400 BC) indicate the practice has a lengthy tradition.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Romero Molina, Javier|chapter=Dental Mutilation, Trephination, and Cranial Deformation |title=Handbook of Middle American Indians, Vol. 9: Physical Anthropology |editor=T. Dale Stewart (volume ed.) |others=[[Robert Wauchope (archaeologist)|Robert Wauchope]] (series ed.) |publisher= [[University of Texas Press]] |location=Austin |year=1970 |edition=2nd. edition (revised)|isbn=0-292-70014-8|oclc=277126}}</ref>

A study of ten low-status burials from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic]] period at [[Monte Alb<U+00E1>n]] concluded that the trepanation had been applied non-therapeutically, and, since multiple techniques had been used and since some people had received more than one trepanation, concluded it had been done experimentally. Inferring the events to represent experiments on people until they died, the study interpreted that use of trepanation as an indicator of the stressful sociopolitical climate that not long thereafter resulted in the abandonment of Monte Alban as the primary regional administrative center in the [[Oaxaca]]n highlands.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Specimens identified from the [[Maya civilization]] region of southern Mexico, [[Guatemala]] and the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]] show no evidence of the drilling or cutting techniques found in central and highland Mexico. Instead, the pre-Columbian Maya apparently used an abrasive technique that ground away at the back of the skull, thinning the bone and sometimes perforating it, similar to the examples from Cholula. Many skulls from the Maya region date from the Postclassic period (ca. 950&ndash;1400), and include specimens found at [[Palenque]] in [[Chiapas]], and recovered from the [[Sacred Cenote]] at the prominent Postclassic site of [[Chichen Itza]] in northern Yucat<U+00E1>n.<ref>{{cite paper|author=Tiesler Blos, Vera|date=1999 |title=Rasgos Bioculturales Entre los Antiguos Mayas: Aspectos Culturales y Sociales |publisher=Doctoral thesis in Anthropology, UNAM |language=Spanish }}</ref>

===Pre-modern Europe===
Trepanation was also practiced in the classical and [[Renaissance]] periods. [[Hippocrates]] gave specific directions on the procedure from its evolution through the Greek age, and [[Galen]] also elaborates on the procedure. During the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], trepanation was practiced as a cure for various ailments, including seizures and skull fractures. Out of eight skulls with trepanations from the 6th to 8th centuries found in southwestern [[Germany]], seven skulls show clear evidence of healing and survival after trepanation suggesting that the survival rate of the operations was high and the infection rate was low.<ref name=Weber>{{cite journal|author=Weber, J. |coauthors=and A. Czarnetzki |title=Trepanationen im fr<U+00FC>hen Mittelalter im S<U+00FC>dwesten von Deutschland - Indikationen, Komplikationen und Outcome |journal=Zentralblatt f<U+00FC>r Neurochirurgie |volume=62 |issue=1|pages=10 |year=2001 |doi=10.1055/s-2001-16333 |language=German}}</ref>

==Modern medical practices==
Trepanation is a treatment used for [[epidural hematoma|epidural]] and [[subdural hematoma]]s, and for surgical access for certain other neurosurgical procedures, such as intracranial pressure monitoring.  Modern surgeons generally use the term [[craniotomy]] for this procedure. The removed piece of skull is typically replaced as soon as possible.  If the bone is not replaced, then the procedure is considered a [[craniectomy]]. Trepanation instruments are now available with diamond coated rims ([[Diamond Bone Cutting System]]), which are less traumatic than the classical trephines with sharp teeth. They are smooth to soft tissues and cut only bone.

==Voluntary trepanation==
Although widely considered today to be [[pseudoscience]], the practice of trepanation for other purported medical benefits continues.  Moreover recent research on the increase in cranial compliance following on trepanation, with resulting increase in blood flow,<ref>http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227121.400-like-a-hole-in-the-head-the-return-of-trepanation.html?full=true</ref> may indicate some justification for the practice. Individuals may practice non-emergency trepanation for psychic purposes. A prominent proponent of the modern view is [[Peter Halvorson]], who drilled a hole in the front of his own skull to increase "brain blood volume".<ref name="restak2000" />

The most prominent folk theory for the benefits of self-trepanation is offered by [[Bart Huges]] &ndash; alternatively spelled Bart Hughes and sometimes called "Dr. Bart Hughes", although he did not complete his medical degree.  Hughes claims that trepanation increases "brain blood volume" and thereby enhances cerebral metabolism in a manner similar to cerebral [[vasodilators]] such as [[ginkgo biloba]].  No published results have supported these claims. 

In a chapter of his book, ''Eccentric Lives & Peculiar Notions'', John Michell cites Huges as pioneering the idea of trepanation in his 1962 monograph, ''Homo Sapiens Correctus'', which is most often cited by advocates of self-trepanation.  Among other arguments, Huges contends that children have a higher state of consciousness and since children's skulls are not fully closed one can return to an earlier, childlike state of consciousness by self-trepanation.  Further, by allowing the brain to freely pulsate Huges argues that a number of benefits will accrue.

Michell quotes a book called ''Bore Hole'' written by [[Joey Mellen]].  At the time the passage below was written, Joey and his partner, [[Amanda Feilding]], had made two previous attempts at trepanning Mellen.  The second attempt ended up placing Mellen in the hospital, where he was reprimanded severely and sent for psychiatric evaluation.  After he returned home, Mellen decided to try again.  He describes his third attempt at self-trepanation:

<blockquote>After some time there was an ominous sounding schlurp and the sound of bubbling.  I drew the trepan out and the gurgling continued. It sounded like air bubbles running under the skull as they were pressed out. I looked at the trepan and there was a bit of bone in it. At last!</blockquote>

Amanda Feilding also performed a self-trepanation with a drill, while her partner Joey Mellen filmed the operation, in the film titled ''Heartbeat in the Brain''.  The film has since been lost.  Portions of the film can be seen, however, in the documentary ''A Hole in the Head''.

Mitchell also describes a British group that advocates self-trepanation to allow the brain access to more space and oxygen. Other modern practitioners of trepanation claim that it holds other medical benefits, such as a treatment for depression or other psychological ailments. In 2000, two men from [[Cedar City, Utah]] were prosecuted for practicing medicine without a license after they performed a trepanation on an English woman to treat her chronic fatigue syndrome and [[Clinical depression|depression]].<ref>[http://www.rcfp.org/news/2000/1016trepan.html Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (2000) ''ABC ordered to hand over unedited head-drilling tapes'']</ref>

==In popular culture==
*In the movie ''[[Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World]]'' a trepanation is performed on a crew member by the ship's doctor, with the hole filled by using a coin.
*In the television series ''[[Dead Like Me]]'', the character [[List of Dead Like Me characters#Mason|Mason]], played by [[Callum Blue]], died in 1966 by drilling a hole in his head to achieve "the permanent high."
*In the movie ''[[Pi_(film)|<big>&pi;</big>]]'', the protagonist cures his migraines by performing a trepanation on his right temple.
