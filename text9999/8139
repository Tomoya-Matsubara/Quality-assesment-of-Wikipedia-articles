==History==
Part of the building of the Hotel Laurus al Duomo was the ancient location of the Oratory of the <U+201C>Societas Beati Bartolomei<U+201D>, whose protector was Saint Bartholomew.<ref>Anna Benvenuti, <U+201C>Il sovramondo delle arti fiorentine. Tra i santi delle corporazioni<U+201D>, in <U+201C>Arti fiorentine. La grande storia dell<U+2019>artigianato, vol I, Il Medioevo, Florence, 1998, p. 16.</ref>   
In Via de<U+2019> Cerretani, till the mid 19th century, stood the palaces of the Carnesecchi and the Cappelli houses.<ref>Piero Bargellini, Ennio Guarnieri, <U+201C>Le strade di Firenze<U+201D>, Florence, Bonechi, 1980, sub Cerretani</ref> 
When Florence became Italy<U+2019>s capital city (1864-1870), the area was reorganized one first time. A new reorganization took place in the 1930s and Via de<U+2019> Cerretani was widened. Many medieval buildings were pulled down and replaced by modern palaces<ref>Le strade di Firenze, sub Cerretani.</ref>

In the 1970s an important restoration of the building begun but the historic 1800 fa<U+00E7>ade  was maintained. During the [[1966 Flood of the Arno River]] the hotel was under construction . Only the basements, the stairs and the third floor garret had been built. Probably these structures prevented the tumbling down of the nearby edifices. 
In 1972 part of the building was turned into a first class 4 stars hotel with the name of <U+201C>Laurus<U+201D>, to keep some memory of the ancient history of the area and in particular of the laurel grove placed between Via dell<U+2019>Alloro and Via del Giglio.
In 1989 the Hotel Laurus al Duomo was acquired by the hotel company Vivahotels. In 2004 the hotel was restored once again to the shape it has today.

==Interior==
The 4 stars first class hotel offers 50 rooms of different categories, well equipped and styled with typical  1800s Florentine furniture. Most of the rooms have a view on the historic heart of the city. From the terrace at the top floor it is possible to enjoy an unusual panoramic view on the [[Brunelleschi's dome]]
