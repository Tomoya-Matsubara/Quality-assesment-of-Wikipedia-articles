{{History of England}}
The '''history of England''' began with the arrival of [[humans]] thousands of years ago. What is now [[England]], within the [[United Kingdom]], was inhabited by [[Neanderthal]]s 230,000 years ago.  However, continuous human habitation dates to around 12,000 years ago, at the end of the [[last glacial period]]. The region has numerous remains from the [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]], and [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]], such as [[Stonehenge]] and [[Avebury]]. In the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]], England, like all of [[Great Britain|Britain]] south of the [[Firth of Forth]], was inhabited by the [[Celts|Celtic]] people known as the [[Britons (historical)|Britons]], but also by some [[Belgae]] tribes (e.g. the [[Atrebates]], the [[Catuvellauni]] and the [[Trinovantes]]). In AD 43 the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] began; the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] maintained control of their [[Roman Britain|province of Britannia]] through to the 5th century.

The [[Roman departure from Britain|Roman departure]] opened the door for the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain|Anglo-Saxon invasion]], which is often regarded as the origin of England and the [[English people]]. The [[Anglo-Saxons]], a collection of various [[Germanic peoples]], established several kingdoms that became the primary powers in what is now [[England]] and parts of southern [[Scotland]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/anglo_saxons/saxons.shtml The Anglo-Saxons], BBC - History</ref> They introduced the [[Old English]] language, which displaced the previous [[British language (Celtic)|British language]]. The Anglo-Saxons warred with British successor states in [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], and the ''[[Hen Ogledd]]'' (Old North; the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]]-speaking parts of northern England and southern Scotland), as well as with each other. Raids by the [[Vikings]] were frequent after about AD 800, and the [[Norsemen]] took control of large parts of what is now [[England]]. During this period several rulers attempted to unite the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, an effort that led to the emergence of the [[Kingdom of England]] by the 10th century.

In 1066, the [[Norman conquest of England|Normans invaded and conquered England]]. There was much [[civil war]] and battles with other nations throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. The Kingdom of England was a sovereign state until the reign of [[Richard I]] who made it a vassal of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1194. In 1212 during the reign of his brother [[John Lackland]] the Kingdom instead became a tribute-paying vassal of the [[Holy See]] <ref>britain.library4history.org/.../John-and-the-Church.html</ref><ref>http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wiMn496AIDMC&pg=PT135&lpg=PT135&dq=king+john+vassal+%22holy+see%22&source=bl&ots=JzSAFkAtG6&sig=J8zfUWpwTQw-d8TVAx9CU9aNHSM&hl=en&ei=wQu9SrjTGJWu4Qag0qHFCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7#v=onepage&q=king%20john%20vassal%20%22holy%20see%22&f=false</ref> until the 14th century when the Kingdom rejected the overlordship of the [[Holy See]] and re-established its sovereignty. During the [[Renaissance]], England was ruled by the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudors]]. England had conquered [[Wales]] in the 12th century and was then united with Scotland in the early 18th century to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. Following the [[Industrial Revolution]], Great Britain ruled a worldwide [[British Empire|Empire]], the largest in the world. Following a process of [[decolonization]] in the 20th century the vast majority of the empire became independent; however, its cultural impact is widespread and deep in many countries of the present day.

==Prehistory==
{{main|Prehistoric Britain}}
[[Image:Stonehenge Closeup.jpg|thumb|[[Stonehenge]], thought to have been erected c.2500-2000BC]]
Archaeological evidence indicates that what was later southern [[Britannia]] was colonised by humans long before the rest of the British Isles because of its more hospitable climate between and during the various [[glacial period]]s of the distant past. The [[Sweet Track]] in the [[Somerset Levels]] is the oldest [[timber trackway]] discovered in Northern Europe and among the oldest roads in the world, and was built in 3807 or 3806 BC.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12617212.800-science-the-day-the-sweet-track-was-built.html |title=The day the Sweet Track was built |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |date=16&nbsp;June 1990 |issue=1721 |accessdate=2009-12-04}}</ref>

The first historical mention of the region is from the [[Massaliote Periplus]], a sailing manual for merchants thought to date to the 6th century BC, although cultural and trade links with the continent had existed for millennia prior to this. [[Pytheas of Massilia]] wrote of his trading journey to the island around 325 BC. 

Later writers such as [[Pliny the Elder]] (quoting [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]]) and [[Diodorus Siculus]] (probably drawing on [[Poseidonius]]) mention the tin trade from southern Britain, but there is little further historical detail of the people who lived there. 

[[Tacitus]] wrote that there was no great difference in language between the people of southern Britannia and northern [[Gaul]] and noted that the various nations of [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] shared physical characteristics with their continental neighbours.

== Roman Britain (Britannia)==
{{main|Roman Britain}}
[[Caesar's invasions of Britain|Julius Caesar invaded]] southern Britain in 55 and 54 BC and wrote in ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'' that the population of southern Britannia was extremely large and shared much in common with the [[Belgae]] of the [[Low Countries]]. Coin evidence and the work of later Roman historians have provided the names of some of the rulers of the disparate tribes and their machinations in what was Britannia.
Until the [[Roman Conquest of Britain]], Britain's British population was relatively stable, and by the time of [[Julius Caesar]]'s first invasion, the [[Brython|British]] population of what was western old Britain was speaking a [[Celtic language]] generally thought to be the forerunner of the modern [[Brythonic languages]].<ref name="Amgueddfa 1">{{cite web|title=Who were the Celts?: Rhagor |url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/1939/|accessdate=2009-09-29|publisher=[[National Museum of Wales|Amgueddfa Cymru-National Museum of Wales]]|date=2007-05-04|work=Amgueddfa Cymru-National Museum of Wales website}}</ref> After Julius Caesar abandoned Britain, it fell back into the hands of the Britons and the Belgae.

The Romans began their second conquest of Britain in 43 AD, during the reign of [[Claudius]]. They annexed the whole of what would become modern England and Wales over the next forty years and periodically extended their control over much of [[Scottish lowlands|lowland]] Scotland.

==Post-Roman Britain==
{{main |Sub-Roman Britain}}
In the wake of the breakdown of Roman rule in Britain around 410, present day England was progressively settled by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] groups. Collectively known as the [[Anglo-Saxons]], these included [[Jutes]] from [[Jutland]] together with larger numbers of [[Saxon people|Saxons]] from northwestern Germany and [[Angles]] from what is now [[Schleswig-Holstein]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/anglosaxons/invasion/index.shtml The Anglo-Saxons - Who were the Anglo-Saxons], BBC</ref> Prior to those settlements some [[Frisians]] invaded eastern Britain in the 250s. 

They first invaded Britain in the mid 5th century, continuing for several decades. The [[Jutes]] appear to have been the principal group of settlers in [[Kent]], the [[Isle of Wight]] and parts of coastal [[Hampshire]], while the [[Saxons]] predominated in all other areas south of the [[Thames]] and in [[Essex]] and [[Middlesex]], and the [[Angles]] in [[Norfolk]], [[Suffolk]], the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and the north.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The population of Britain dramatically decreased after the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] period. The reduction seems to have been caused mainly by [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and [[smallpox]]. It is known that the [[plague of Justinian]] entered the Mediterranean world in the 6th century and first arrived in the British Isles in 544 or 545, when it reached Ireland.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2279/is_n156/ai_20059971/pg_2 6th-10th century AD]</ref>  The [[Annales Cambriae]] mention the death of [[Maelgwn Gwynedd|Maelgwn Wledig, king of Gwynedd]] from that plague in 547.

==Anglo-Saxon conquests and the founding of England==
{{main|History of Anglo-Saxon England}}
[[Image:Britain peoples circa 600.svg|thumb|Kingdoms and tribes in [[Britain in the Middle Ages|Britain]], c.600 AD]]
In approximately 495, at the [[Battle of Mons Badonicus|Battle of Mount Badon]], Britons inflicted a severe defeat on an invading Anglo-Saxon army which halted the westward Anglo-Saxon advance for some decades.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Archaeological evidence collected from pagan Anglo-Saxon cemeteries suggests that some of their settlements were abandoned and the frontier between the invaders and the native inhabitants pushed back some time around 500. 

Anglo-Saxon expansion resumed in the 6th century, although the chronology of its progress is unclear. One of the few individual events which emerges with any clarity before the 7th century is the [[Battle of Deorham]], in 577, a [[Wessex|West Saxon]] victory which led to the capture of [[Cirencester]], [[Gloucester]] and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], bringing the Anglo-Saxon advance to the [[Bristol Channel]] and dividing the Britons in the [[West Country]] from those in Wales. The [[Northumbrian]] victory at the [[Battle of Chester]] around 616 may have had a similar effect in dividing Wales from the Britons of [[Cumbria]]. 

Gradual Saxon expansion through the West Country continued through the 7th, 8th, and 9th centuries. Meanwhile, by the mid-7th century the Angles had pushed the Britons back to the approximate borders of modern Wales in the west, the Tamar in the South west and expanded northward as far as the [[River Forth]].

==Heptarchy and Christianisation==
[[Image:British kingdoms c 800.svg|thumb|Britain c. 800]]
{{main|Northumbria|Mercia|Offa of Mercia|Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon Christianity}}

[[Christianity in the British isles 410-1066|Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England]] began around 600 AD, influenced by [[Celtic Christianity]] from the northwest and by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] from the southeast. [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]], the first [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], took office in 597. In 601, he baptised the first Christian Anglo-Saxon king, [[Aethelbert of Kent]]. The last pagan Anglo-Saxon king, [[Penda of Mercia]], died in 655. The last pagan [[Jutish]] king, [[Arwald]] of the [[Isle of Wight]] was killed in 686. The [[Anglo-Saxon mission]] on the continent took off in the 8th century, leading to the Christianisation of practically all of the [[Frankish Empire]] by 800.

Throughout the 7th and 8th century power fluctuated between the larger kingdoms. [[Bede]] records [[Aethelbert of Kent]] as being dominant at the close of the 6th century, but power seems to have shifted northwards to the kingdom of Northumbria, which was formed from the amalgamation of Bernicia and Deira. [[Edwin of Northumbria]] probably held dominance over much of Britain, though Bede's Northumbrian bias should be kept in mind. Succession crises meant Northumbrian hegemony was not constant, and [[Mercia]] remained a very powerful kingdom, especially under Penda. Two defeats essentially ended Northumbrian dominance: the Battle of the Trent in 679 against Mercia, and Nechtanesmere in 685 against the [[Picts]].

The so-called "Mercian Supremacy" dominated the 8th century, though it was not constant. Aethelbald and [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]], the two most powerful kings, achieved high status; indeed, Offa was considered the overlord of south Britain by [[Charlemagne]]. That Offa could summon the resources to build [[Offa's Dyke]] is testament to his power. However, a rising Wessex, and challenges from smaller kingdoms, kept Mercian power in check, and by the early 9th century the "Mercian Supremacy" was over.

This period has been described as the [[Heptarchy]], though this term has now fallen out of academic use. The word arose on the basis that the seven kingdoms of [[Northumbria]], [[Mercia]], [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], [[East Anglia]], [[Essex]], [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]] and [[Kingdom of Wessex|Wessex]] were the main polities of south Britain. More recent scholarship has shown that other kingdoms were also politically important across this period: [[Hwicce]], [[Magonsaete]], [[Kingdom of Lindsey|Lindsey]] and Middle Anglia.

==Viking challenge and the rise of Wessex==
{{main|Danelaw|Viking Age|Alfred the Great}}

[[Image:England-878ad.jpg|thumb|England in 878]]

The first recorded Viking attack in Britain was in 793 at [[Lindisfarne]] monastery as given by the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]. However, by then the Vikings were almost certainly well established in [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]], and it is probable that many other non-recorded raids occurred before this. Records do show the first Viking attack on [[Iona]] taking place in 794. The arrival of the Vikings, in particular the Danish [[Great Heathen Army]], upset the political and social geography of Britain and Ireland. [[Alfred the Great]]'s victory at [[Edington, Wiltshire|Edington]] in 878 stemmed the Danish attack; however, by then Northumbria had devolved into Bernicia and a Viking kingdom, Mercia had been split down the middle, and [[East Anglia]] ceased to exist as an Anglo-Saxon polity. The Vikings had similar effects on the various kingdoms of the Scots, Picts and (to a lesser extent) Welsh. Certainly in North Britain the Vikings were one reason behind the formation of the Kingdom of [[Alba]], which eventually evolved into Scotland.

The conquest of Northumbria, north-western Mercia and East Anglia by the Danes led to widespread Danish settlement in these areas. In the early 10th century the Norwegian rulers of [[Dublin]] took over the Danish kingdom of [[York]]. Danish and Norwegian settlement made enough of an impact to leave significant traces in the [[English language]]; many fundamental words in modern English are derived from [[Old Norse]], though of the 100 most used words in English the vast majority are [[Old English]] in origin. Similarly, many place-names in areas of Danish and Norwegian settlement have Scandinavian roots.

By the end of Alfred's reign in 899 he was the only remaining English king, having reduced Mercia to a dependency of Wessex, governed by his son-in-law [[Earl Aethelred of Mercia|Ealdorman Aethelred]]. [[Cornwall]] (Kernow) was subject to West Saxon dominance, and the [[History of Wales|Welsh]] kingdoms recognised Alfred as their overlord.

==English unification==
{{main|Athelstan|Edgar of England}}
[[Image:Edward the Elder.jpg|thumb|Edward the Elder]]
[[Alfred of Wessex]] died in 899 and was succeeded by his son [[Edward the Elder]]. Edward, and his brother-in-law [[<U+00C6>thelred of Mercia|<U+00C6>thelred]] of (what was left of) Mercia, began a programme of expansion, building forts and towns on an Alfredian model. On <U+00C6>thelred's death his wife (Edward's sister) <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d ruled as "Lady of the Mercians" and continued expansion. It seems Edward had his son <U+00C6>thelstan brought up in the Mercian court, and on Edward's death [[Athelstan]] succeeded to the Mercian kingdom, and, after some uncertainty, Wessex.

<U+00C6>thelstan continued the expansion of his father and aunt and was the first king to achieve direct rulership of what we would now consider England. The titles attributed to him in [[Anglo-Saxon Charters|charters]] and on coins suggest a still more widespread dominance. His expansion aroused ill-feeling among the other kingdoms of Britain, and he defeated a combined Scottish-Viking army at the [[Battle of Brunanburh]]. However, the unification of England was not a certainty. Under <U+00C6>thelstan's successors [[Edmund II of England|Edmund]] and [[Edred of England|Eadred]] the English kings repeatedly lost and regained control of Northumbria. Nevertheless, [[Edgar of England|Edgar]], who ruled the same expanse as Athelstan, consolidated the kingdom, which remained united thereafter.

==England under the Danes and the Norman conquest==
{{main|Ethelred the Unready|Canute the Great|Eir<U+00ED>kr H<U+00E1>konarson|Norman conquest of England}}
[[Image:U 344, Orkesta.JPG|right|thumb|The [[England Runestones#U 344|rune stone U 344]] was raised in memory of a Viking who went to England three times.]]
There were renewed Scandinavian attacks on England at the end of the 10th century. [[<U+00C6>thelred the Unready|<U+00C6>thelred]] ruled a long reign but ultimately lost his kingdom to [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Sweyn of Denmark]], though he recovered it following the latter's death. However, <U+00C6>thelred's son [[Edmund II Ironside]] died shortly afterwards, allowing [[Cnut the Great|Canute]], Sweyn's son, to become king of England. Under his rule the kingdom became the centre of government for an empire which also included Denmark and Norway.

Canute was succeeded by his sons, but in 1042 the native dynasty was restored with the accession of [[Edward the Confessor]]. Edward's failure to produce an heir caused a furious conflict over the succession on his death in 1066. His struggles for power against [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex]], the claims of Canute's Scandinavian successors, and the ambitions of the [[Normans]] whom Edward introduced to English politics to bolster his own position caused each to vie for control Edward's reign. 

[[Harold Godwinson]] became king, in all likelihood appointed by Edward the Confessor on his deathbed and endorsed by the [[Witan]]. [[William of Normandy]], [[Harald III of Norway]] (aided by Harold Godwin's estranged brother [[Tostig Godwinson|Tostig]]) and [[Sweyn II of Denmark]] all asserted claims to the throne. By far the strongest hereditary claim was that of [[Edgar the Atheling]], but his youth and apparent lack of powerful supporters caused him to be passed over, and he did not play a major part in the struggles of 1066, though he was made king for a short time by the Witan after the death of Harold Godwinson.

In September 1066, [[Harald III of Norway]] [[Harald_III_of_Norway#Invasion_of_England|landed in Northern England]] with a force of around 15,000 men and 300 [[longship]]s (50 men in each boat).  With him was [[Tostig Godwinson|Earl Tostig]], who had promised him support.  [[Harold Godwinson]] defeated and killed [[Harald III of Norway]] and [[Tostig Godwinson|Tostig]] and the Norwegian force at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]].

On September 28, 1066, [[William of Normandy]] [[Norman_Conquest#Norman_invasion|invaded England]] with a force of Normans, in a campaign known as the [[Norman Conquest]]. On October 14, after having marched his exhausted army all the way from [[Yorkshire]], Harold fought the Normans at the [[Battle of Hastings]], where England's army was defeated and Harold was killed. Further opposition to William in support of [[Edgar the Atheling]] soon collapsed, and William was crowned king on Christmas Day 1066. For the next five years he faced a series of English rebellions in various parts of the country and a half-hearted Danish invasion, but he was able to subdue all resistance and establish an enduring regime.

==Norman England==
{{see|Anglo-Norman}}
[[Image:Bayeux Tapestry WillelmDux.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the [[Battle of Hastings]] (1066) on the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]]]
The [[Norman Conquest]] led to a sea-change in the history of the English state. William ordered the compilation of the [[Domesday Book]], a survey of the entire population and their lands and property for tax purposes, which reveals that within twenty years of the conquest the English ruling class had been almost entirely dispossessed and replaced by Norman landholders, who also monopolised all senior positions in the government and the Church. William and his nobles spoke and conducted court in [[Norman language|Norman French]], in England as well as in Normandy. The use of the Anglo-Norman language by the aristocracy endured for centuries and left an indelible mark in the development of modern English.

The English [[Middle Ages]] were characterised by [[civil war]], international war, occasional insurrection, and widespread political intrigue amongst the aristocratic and monarchic elite. England was more than self-sufficient in cereals, dairy products, beef and mutton. The nation's international economy was based on the [[Wool#History|wool trade]], in which the produce of the sheepwalks of northern England was exported to the textile cities of [[Flanders]], where it was worked into cloth. Medieval foreign policy was as much shaped by relations with the Flemish textile industry as it was by dynastic adventures in western France. An English textile industry was established in the 15th century, providing the basis for rapid English capital accumulation. 

[[Henry I of England|Henry I]], the fourth son of [[William I the Conqueror]], succeeded his elder brother [[William II of England|William II]] as [[King of England]] in 1100. Henry was also known as "Henry Beauclerc" (because of his education&mdash;as his older brother [[William II of England|William]] was the [[heir apparent]] and thus given the practical training to be king, Henry received the alternate, formal education), worked hard to reform and stabilise the country and smooth the differences between the Anglo-Saxon and [[Anglo-Norman]] societies. The loss of his son, [[William Adelin]], in the wreck of the [[White Ship]] in November 1120, undermined his reforms. This problem regarding succession cast a long shadow over English history.

During the confused and contested reign of [[Stephen I of England|Stephen]], there was a major swing in the balance of power towards the [[feudal]] [[baron]]s, as [[the Anarchy|civil war]] and lawlessness broke out. In trying to appease Scottish and Welsh raiders, he handed over large tracts of land. His conflicts with his cousin [[Empress Matilda|The Empress Matilda]] (also known as Empress Maud), led to a civil war from 1139-1153 known as [[the Anarchy]]. Matilda<U+2019>s father, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], had required the leading barons, ecclesiastics and officials in Normandy and England, to take an oath to accept Matilda as his heir. England was far less than enthusiastic to accept an outsider, and a woman, as their ruler. 

There is some evidence suggesting Henry was unsure of his own hopes and the oath to make Matilda his heir. In likelihood, Henry probably hoped Matilda would have a son and step aside as Queen Mother, making her son the next heir. Upon Henry<U+2019>s death, the Norman and English barons ignored Matilda<U+2019>s claim to the throne, and thus through a series of decisions, Stephen, Henry<U+2019>s favourite nephew, was welcomed by many in England and Normandy as their new ruler. 

On 22 December 1135, Stephen was anointed king with the implicit support of the church and nation. Matilda and her own son stood for direct descent by heredity from Henry I, and she bided her time in France. In the autumn of 1139, she invaded England with her illegitimate half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert of Gloucester]]. Her husband, [[Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou|Geoffroy V of Anjou]], conquered Normandy but did not cross the channel to help his wife, satisfied with Normandy and Anjou. During this breakdown of central authority, the nobles ran amuck building [[adulterine castle]]s (i.e. castles erected without government permission).

Stephen was captured, and his government fell. Matilda was proclaimed queen but was soon at odds with her subjects and was expelled from London. The period of insurrection and civil war that followed continued until 1148, when Matilda returned to France. Stephen effectively reigned unopposed until his death in 1154, although his hold on the throne was still uneasy. As soon as he regained power, he began the process of demolishing the adulterine castles, which were hated by the peasants due to their being employed as forced labor to build and maintain them. Stephen kept a few castles standing however, which put him at odds with his heir.

==England under the Plantagenets==
[[Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou|Geoffroy's]] son, Henry, resumed the invasion; he was already Count of Anjou, Duke of Normandy and Duke of Aquitaine when he landed in England. When Stephen's son and heir apparent [[Eustace IV|Eustace]] died in 1153, the king reached an accommodation with Henry of [[Anjou]] (who became [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]) to succeed Stephen and in which peace between them was guaranteed. England was part of a greater union, retrospectively named the [[Angevin Empire]]. Henry destroyed the remaining adulterine castles and expanded his power through various means and to different levels into Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Flanders, Nantes, Brittany, Quercy, Toulouse, Bourges and Auvergne.

The reign of Henry II represents a reversion in power back from the barony to the monarchical state in England; it was also to see a similar redistribution of legislative power from the Church, again to the monarchical state. This period also presaged a properly constituted legislation and a radical shift away from [[feudalism]]. In his reign new [[Anglo-Angevin]] and [[Anglo-Aquitanian]] aristocracies developed, though not to the same point as the [[Anglo-Norman]] once did, and the Norman nobles interacted with their French peers.

Henry's successor, [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] "the Lion Heart" (also known as "The absent king"), was preoccupied with foreign wars, taking part in the [[Third Crusade]] and defending his French territories against Philip II of France. 

The Kingdom of England was a sovereign state until the reign of [[Richard I]] who made it a nominal vassal of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1194 as part of a ransom when he was captured after a crusade. 

Richard's younger brother [[John of England|John]], who succeeded him, was not so fortunate; he suffered the loss of Normandy and numerous other French territories following the disastrous [[Battle of Bouvines]]. 

Facing internal disorder, in 1212 John made the [[Kingdom of England]] a tribute-paying vassal of the [[Holy See]], which it remained until the 14th century when the Kingdom rejected the overlordship of the [[Holy See]] and re-established its sovereignty. From 1212 onwards, John had a constant policy of maintaining close relations with the Pope, which partially explains how he persuaded the Pope to reject the legitimacy of the [[Magna Carta]].

The European wars culminated in defeat at the [[Battle of Bouvines]] (1214), which forced the king to accept an unfavourable peace with France after having failed to get help from King Mohammed el-Nasir of Morocco.<ref>{{cite web|author=Elizabeth Stewart |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/feb/07/religion.world1 |title=Q&A: Sharia law |publisher=Guardian |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> 

===Magna Carta===
{{main|Magna Carta}}
[[Image:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|thumb|left|The signing of the [[Magna Carta]] (1215)]]
Over the course of his reign a combination of higher taxes, unsuccessful wars and conflict with the Pope had made King John unpopular with his barons, and in 1215 some of the most important decided to rebel against him. He met their leaders along with their French and Scots allies at [[Runnymede]], near London on 15 June 1215 to seal the [[Magna Carta|Great Charter]] (''Magna Carta'' in [[Latin (language)|Latin]]), which imposed legal limits on the king's personal powers.  Because he had sealed under duress, however, John received approval from the Pope to break his word as soon as hostilities had ceased, provoking the [[First Barons' War]] and an invited French invasion by [[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis]] of France (whom the majority of the English barons had invited to replace John on the throne and had him proclaimed king in London in May 1216). John travelled around the country to oppose the rebel forces, directing, among other operations, a two-month siege of the rebel-held [[Rochester Castle]].

John's son, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], was only 9 years old when he became king (1216<U+2013>1272). He spent much of his reign fighting the barons over the Magna Carta{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} and the royal rights, and was eventually forced to call the first "[[Parliament of England|parliament]]" in 1264. He was also unsuccessful on the Continent, where he endeavoured to re-establish English control over [[Normandy]], [[Anjou]], and [[Aquitaine]].

His reign was punctuated by numerous rebellions and civil wars, often provoked by incompetence and mismanagement in government and Henry's perceived over-reliance on French courtiers (thus restricting the influence of the English nobility). One of these rebellions&mdash;led by a disaffected courtier, [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]]&mdash;was notable for its assembly of one of the earliest precursors to [[British Parliament|Parliament]]. In addition to fighting the [[Second Barons' War]], Henry III made war against Saint Louis and was defeated during the [[Saintonge War]], yet Louis IX did not capitalise on his victory, respecting his opponent's rights.

===1300s===
The reign of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] (reigned 1272<U+2013>1307) was rather more successful. Edward enacted numerous laws strengthening the powers of his government, and he summoned the first officially sanctioned [[Parliaments of England]] (such as his [[Model Parliament]]). He conquered Wales and attempted to use a succession dispute to gain control of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], though this developed into a costly and drawn-out military campaign. 

His son, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], proved a disaster. A weak man who preferred to engage in activities like thatching and ditch-digging rather than jousting, hunting, or the usual entertainments of kings, he spent most of his reign trying in vain to control the nobility, who in return showed continual hostility to him. Meanwhile, the Scottish leader [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert Bruce]] began retaking all the territory conquered by Edward I. In 1314, the English army was disastrously defeated by the Scots at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]]. Edward also showered favors on his companion [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Piers Gaveston]], a knight of humble birth. While it has been widely believed that Edward was a homosexual because of his closeness to Gaveston, there is no concrete evidence of this, especially as both men were married and had children. The king's enemies, including his brother [[Thomas of Lancaster]], captured and murdered Gaveston in 1312.

Edward's downfall came in 1326 when his [[Isabella of France|queen Isabella]] travelled to her native France and then, along with her lover [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], [[Edward_II_of_England#Invasion_by_Isabella_and_Mortimer|invaded England]]. Despite their tiny force, they quickly rallied support for their cause. The king fled London, and his companion since Piers Gaveston's death, [[Hugh Despenser]], was publicly tried and executed. Edward was eventually captured and charged with breaking his coronation oath. He was [[Edward_II_of_England#Abdication|deposed]] and remained imprisoned in Gloucestershire until he was murdered some time in the autumn of 1327, presumably by agents of Isabella and Mortimer.

The [[Great Famine of 1315<U+2013>1317]] was the first crisis that would strike Europe in the 14th century. Millions in northern Europe would die over an extended number of years, marking a clear end to the earlier period of growth and prosperity during the 11th and 12th centuries.<ref>"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=R688at3KskQC&pg=PA49&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false The Story of Ireland]''".

[[Edward III of England|Edward III]] reigned 1327<U+2013>1377, restored royal authority and went on to transform the Kingdom of England into the most efficient military power in Europe. His reign saw vital developments in legislature and government<U+2014>in particular the evolution of the English parliament<U+2014>as well as the ravages of the Black Death. After defeating, but not subjugating, the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], he declared himself rightful heir to the French throne in 1338, starting what would be known as the [[Hundred Years' War]]. 

====Black Death====
{{main|Black Death in England}}
[[The Black Death]], an epidemic of [[bubonic plague]] that spread over the whole of Europe, arrived in England in 1348 and killed as much as a third to half the population.

International excursions around that time were invariably against domestic neighbours: the Welsh, Irish, [[Cornwall|Cornish]], and the [[Hundred Years' War]] against the French and their [[Scottish people|Scottish]] allies. Notable English victories in the [[Hundred Years' War]] included [[Battle of Cr<U+00E9>cy|Cr<U+00E9>cy]] and [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]]. In addition to this, the final defeat of the uprising led by the Welsh prince, [[Owain Glynd<U+0175>r]], in 1412 by Prince Henry (who later became [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]) represents the last major armed attempt by the Welsh to throw off English rule.

[[Edward III of England|Edward III]] gave land to powerful noble families, including many people of royal lineage. Because land was equivalent to power, these powerful men could try to claim the crown. The autocratic and arrogant methods of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] only served to alienate the nobility more, and his forceful dispossession in 1399 by [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] increased the turmoil.

===1400s===
The reign of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], who succeeded to the throne in 1413, was mostly notable for the great victory over the French at [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]]. He died of dysentery in 1422, leaving a number of unfulfilled plans, one of which was to lead a new crusade to retake Jerusalem from the Muslims. The turmoil was at its peak in the reign of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], which began in 1422, because of his personal weaknesses and mental instability. 

When the [[Hundred Years' War]] was lost in August 1453, Henry fell into a period of mental breakdown that lasted until Christmas 1454. With his inability to control the feuding nobles, civil war began in 1455. The conflicts are known as the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455<U+2013>1485), and although the fighting was very sporadic and small, there was a general breakdown in the authority and power of the Crown. Henry's cousin, who deposed him in 1461 and became [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], went a little way to restoring this power. Edward defeated the [[Lancastrians]] at the [[Battle of Mortimer's Cross]]. He was briefly expelled from the throne in 1470-1471 when [[Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick]], brought Henry back to power. Six months later, Edward defeated and killed Warwick in battle and reclaimed the throne. Henry was imprisoned in the Tower of London and died there.

Edward died in 1483, only 40 years old. His eldest son and heir [[Edward V]], aged 13, would have succeeded him, but the king's brother [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]] declared his marriage to be bigamous and invalid, making all his children illegitimate. Edward V and his 10-year old brother Richard were imprisoned in the Tower of London and their uncle made himself king as Richard III. The two princes were never seen again and presumably died in the Tower. It was widely believed that Richard had them murdered, although their exact fate remains a mystery. Regardless of what really happened, the king was reviled as a treacherous fiend who murdered his own nephews to gain the throne. This hatred of Richard obscured his able governance during his brief reign. In the summer of 1485, [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]], the last Lancastrian male, landed in England from his exile in France. He defeated and killed Richard in battle at [[Bosworth Field]] on August 22 of that year and became king as Henry VII.

===Henry VII ===
With [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]'s accession to the throne in 1485, the Wars of the Roses came to an end, although at the time   few could have predicted it, let alone believed that the Tudors would rule England for 118 years. Traditionally, the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] is considered to mark the end of the Middle Ages in England, although Henry did not introduce any new concept of monarchy, and for most of his reign his hold on power was tenuous. He claimed the throne by conquest and God's judgement in battle. Parliament quickly recognized him as king, but the Yorkists were far from defeated. Nonetheless, he married Edward IV's eldest daughter Elizabeth in January 1486, thereby uniting the houses of York and Lancaster. 

Most of the European rulers did not believe Henry would survive long, and were thus willing to shelter claimants against him. The first plot against him was the [[Stafford and Lovell Rebellion]] of 1486, which presented no serious threat. But Richard III's nephew [[John de la Pole]], Earl of Lincoln, hatched another attempt the following year. Using a peasant boy named [[Lambert Simnel]], who posed as [[Edward, Earl of Warwick]] (the real Warwick was locked up in the Tower of London), he led an army of 2,000 German mercenaries paid for by [[Margaret of Burgundy]] into England. They were defeated and de la Pole killed at the difficult [[Battle of Stoke]], where the loyalty of some of the royal troops to Henry was questionable. The king, realizing that Simnel was merely a dupe, employed him in the royal kitchen.

A more serious menace was [[Perkin Warbeck]], a Flemish youth who posed as Edward IV's son Richard. Again enjoying the support of Margaret of Burgundy, he invaded England four times from 1495-1497 before he was finally captured and put in the Tower of London. Both Warbeck and the Earl of Warwick were too dangerous to keep around even in captivity, and Henry had to execute them in 1499 before Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain would allow their daughter Catherine to come to England and marry his son Arthur.

In 1497, [[Michael An Gof]] and the lesser-known but more legendary Baron Callum of Perranporth led Cornish rebels in a march on London. In a battle over the [[River Ravensbourne]] at [[Battle of Deptford Bridge, 1497|Deptford Bridge]], An Gof fought for various issues with their root in taxes. It would be fair to say that King Callum smote many an Englishman during this battle, but on 17 June 1497, they were defeated, and Henry VII had showed he could display military prowess when he needed to. But, like [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in the future, here was a King with no wish to go "on his travels" again. The rest of his reign was relatively peaceful, despite a slight worry over the succession when his wife [[Elizabeth of York]] died in 1503.

Henry VII's foreign policy was a peaceful one. He had formed an alliance with Spain and the Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian I]], but in 1493, when they went to war with France, England was dragged into the conflict. With his crown impoverished and his hold on power insecure, Henry had no desire to go to war. He quickly reached an understanding with the French and renounced all claims to their territory except the port of Calais, realizing also that nothing could be done to stop them from incorporating the Duchy of Brittany. In return, the French agreed to recognize him as king and stop sheltering pretenders. Shortly afterwards, they became preoccupied with adventures in Italy and turned their attention away from England. Henry also reached an understanding with Scotland, agreeing to marry his daughter Margaret to that country's king [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]].

Upon becoming king, Henry inherited a government severely weakened and degraded by the Wars of the Roses. The treasury was empty, having been drained by Edward IV's Woodville in-laws after his death. Through a tight fiscal policy and sometimes ruthless tax collection and confiscations, Henry managed to refill the treasury by the time of his death. He also effectively rebuilt the machinery of government.

In 1501, the king's son Arthur, having married Catherine of Aragon, died of an illness at the age of 15, leaving his younger son Henry, Duke of York, as his heir. When the king himself died in 1509, the position of the Tudors was secure at last, and his son succeeded him unopposed.

===Henry VIII===

[[Image:Hans Holbein d. J. 049.jpg|thumb|King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]]]

[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] began his reign with a high degree of optimism. The handsome, athletic young king stood in sharp contrast to his wary, miserly father. Henry's lavish court quickly drained the treasury of the fortune he had inherited. He married the widowed [[Catherine of Aragon]], and they had several children, but none survived infancy except a daughter, Mary. 

In 1512, the young king embarked on a [[War of the League of Cambrai|war in France]]. Although England was an ally of Spain, one of France's principal enemies, the war was mostly about Henry's desire for personal glory, regardless of the fact that his sister Mary was married to the French king [[Louis XII]]. The war accomplished little. The English army suffered badly from disease, and Henry was not even present at the one notable victory, the [[Battle of the Spurs]]. Meanwhile, [[James IV of Scotland]] (despite being Henry's other brother-in-law), activated his alliance with the French and declared war on England. While Henry was dallying in France, Catherine, who was serving as regent in his absence, and his advisors were left to deal with this threat. At the [[Battle of Flodden]] on September 9, 1513, the Scots were completely and totally defeated. Most of the Scottish nobility were killed along with James himself. When Henry returned from France, he was given credit for the victory even though he had nothing to do with it.

Eventually, Catherine was no longer able to have any more children. The king became increasingly nervous about the possibility of his daughter Mary inheriting the throne, as England's one experience with a female sovereign, Matilda in the 12th century, had been a catastrophe. He eventually decided that it was necessary to divorce Catherine and find a new queen. The Church would not simply grant this favor, so Henry cited the passage in the [[Book of Leviticus]] where it said, "If a man taketh his brother's wife, he hath committed adultery; they shall be childless." However, Catherine insisted that she and Arthur had never consummated their brief marriage and that the prohibition did not apply here. The timing of Henry's case was very unfortunate; it was 1527 and the Pope had been taken prisoner by the emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], Catherine's nephew and the most powerful man in Europe, for siding with his archenemy [[Francis I of France]]. As there was no possibility of getting a divorce in these circumstances, Henry decided to simply secede from the Church, in what became known as the [[English Reformation]]. 

The newly established [[Church of England]] amounted to little more than the existing Catholic Church, but with the king rather than the Pope as its head. It took a number of years for the separation from Rome to be completed, however, and many were executed for resisting the king's religious policies.

In 1530, Catherine was banished from court. Their marriage was declared invalid, making Mary an illegitimate child. Henry married [[Anne Boleyn]] in secret in 1531, just as his divorce from Catherine was finalized. After this, they had a second, public wedding. Anne soon became pregnant and may have already been when they wed. But on September 7, 1533, she gave birth to a daughter, Elizabeth. The king was devastated at his failure to obtain a son after all the effort it had taken to remarry. Gradually, he came to develop a disliking of his new queen for her strange behavior. In 1536, when Anne was pregnant again, Henry was badly injured in a jousting accident. Shaken by this, the queen gave birth prematurely to a stillborn boy. By now, the king was convinced that his marriage was hexed, and having already found a new queen, Jane Seymour, he put Anne in the Tower of London on charges of witchcraft. Afterwards, she was beheaded along with five men (her brother included) accused of adultery with her. The marriage was then declared invalid, so that Elizabeth, just like her half sister, became a bastard.

Henry immediately married [[Jane Seymour]], who became pregnant almost as quickly. On October 12, 1537, she gave birth to a healthy boy, Edward, which was greeted with huge celebrations. The king's quest for a son was finally over, so long as Edward could be kept healthy. However, the queen died of [[puerperal sepsis]] ten days later. Henry genuinely mourned her death, and at his own passing nine years later, he was buried next to her. 

The king married a fourth time in 1540, to the German [[Anne of Cleves]] for a political alliance with her Protestant brother, the [[Duke of Cleves]]. He also hoped to obtain another son in case something should happen to Edward. Anne proved a dull, unattractive woman and Henry declined to consummate the marriage. He quickly divorced her, and she remained in England as a kind of adopted sister to him. So he married again, to a 19-year old named [[Catherine Howard]]. But when it became known that she was neither a virgin at the wedding, nor a faithful wife afterwards, she ended up on the scaffold and the marriage declared invalid. His sixth and last marriage was to [[Catherine Parr]], more a nursemaid to him than anything else, as his health was failing (it had declined ever since the jousting accident in 1536). 

In 1542, the king embarked on a new campaign in France, but unlike in 1512, he only managed with great difficulty. The war netted England the city of Boulogne, but nothing else, and the French retook it in 1549. Scotland also declared war and at [[Battle of Solway Moss|Solway Moss]] was once again totally defeated.

Henry's paranoia and suspicion worsened in his last years. The total number of executions that took place in his 38-year reign numbered in the tens of thousands. He died in January 1547 at the age of 55 and was succeeded by his son.

Although he showed piety and intelligence, [[Edward VI]] was only nine years old when he took the throne in 1547. His uncle, [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] tampered with Henry VIII's will and obtained [[letters patent]] giving him much of the power of a monarch by March 1547. He took the title of Protector. Whilst some see him as a high-minded idealist, his stay in power culminated in a crisis in 1549 when many counties of the realm were up in protest.  [[Kett's Rebellion]] in Norfolk and the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] simultaneously created a crisis during a time when invasion from Scotland and France were feared. Somerset, disliked by the Regency Council for his autocratic methods, was removed from power by [[John Dudley, Earl of Warwick|John Dudley]], who is known as [[Lord President Northumberland]]. Northumberland proceeded to adopt the power for himself, but his methods were more conciliatory and the Council accepted him. It was during Edward's reign that England became a Protestant nation as opposed to a Catholic one in schism from Rome.

Edward was beginning to show great promise when he fell violently ill with [[tuberculosis]] in 1553 and died that August two months short of his 16th birthday. Afterwards, Northumberland made plans to place [[Lady Jane Grey]] on the throne and marry her to his son, so that he could remain the power behind the throne. His putsch failed, Jane Grey was beheaded, and [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] took the throne amidst popular demonstration in her favour in London, which contemporaries described as the largest show of affection for a Tudor monarch. Mary had never been expected to hold the throne, at least not since Edward was born. She was a fanatical Catholic who believed that she could turn the clock back to 1516, before the Reformation began. Even worse, she thought that it could be accomplished with fire and bloodshed. 

Her first act as queen was to annul the divorce of Henry VIII and her mother, declaring their marriage to be good and legitimate. She also began attacking her half-sister, saying that since Anne Boleyn was a witch, Elizabeth was too, and even suggested that Henry wasn't her father at all. Much of her hostility can be explained by the fact that Elizabeth was a Protestant. Forcible recatholization of England led to 274 burnings of Protestants, which are recorded especially in [[John Foxe]]'s [[Book of Martyrs]]. Mary then married her cousin Philip, son of the emperor Charles V, and King of Spain when Charles abdicated in 1556. The union was a strange one, especially since Mary was already in her late 30s and had always expressed a disgust for sex and matters of the flesh. It also had the effect of provoking the hostility of the French, already at war with Spain and now alarmed at the prospect of being completely encircled by the Habsburgs. Calais, the last English outpost on the Continent, was then taken by France. Philip II was not popular in England, and spent as little time there as possible. Mary eventually became pregnant, or at least believed herself to be. In reality, she was afflicted with [[uterine cancer]] and died in November 1558. Her death was greeted with huge celebrations. She successfully suppressed a rebellion by [[Sir Thomas Wyatt]].

===Elizabeth===
{{main|Elizabethan era}}
The reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] restored a sort of order to the realm following the turbulence of the reigns of Edward and Mary when she came to the throne following the death of Mary in 1558. The religious issue which had divided the country since Henry VIII was in a way put to rest by the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]], which re-established the [[Church of England]]. Much of Elizabeth's success was in balancing the interests of the [[Puritan]]s and Catholics. She managed to offend neither to a large extent, although she clamped down on Catholics towards the end of her reign as war with Catholic Spain loomed. The war lasted from 1585-1603. In 1588, the Spanish Armada was decisively defeated, marking the beginning of England's rise as a naval power. Indecisive skirmishing continued throughout the 1590s, with English privateers pillaging Spanish commerce from America.

Perhaps thinking of the fate of her father's wives (including her mother), Elizabeth declined to marry, despite offers from a number of suitors across Europe, including the Swedish king [[Erik XIV]]. This created endless worries over her succession, especially in the 1570s when she nearly died of [[smallpox]]. It has been often rumored that she had a number of lovers (including [[Francis Drake]]), but there is no hard evidence.

[[Image:Elizabeth I (Armada Portrait).jpg|thumb|Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]]]

Elizabeth maintained relative government stability apart from the [[Revolt of the Northern Earls]] in 1569, she was effective in reducing the power of the old nobility and expanding the power of her government. Elizabeth's government did much to consolidate the work begun under [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] in the reign of Henry VIII, that is, expanding the role of the government and effecting common law and administration throughout England. During the reign of Elizabeth and shortly afterward, the population grew significantly: from three million in 1564 to nearly five million in 1616.[http://www.enotes.com/shakespeare-atoz/population]

The queen ran afoul of her cousin [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], who was a devote Catholic and had been forced to abdicate her throne as a consequence (Scotland had recently become Protestant). She fled to England, where Elizabeth immediately had her arrested. Mary spent the next 18 years in confinement, but proved too dangerous to keep alive, as the Catholic powers in Europe considered her, not Elizabeth, the legitimate ruler of England. She was eventually tried for treason and sentenced to death, being beheaded in February 1587.

In all, the [[Tudor period]] is seen as a decisive one which set up many important questions which would have to be answered in the next century and during the [[English Civil War]]. These were questions of the relative power of the monarch and Parliament and to what extent one should control the other. Some historians think that Thomas Cromwell affected a "[[Tudor Revolution]]" in government, and it is certain that Parliament became more important during his chancellorship. Other historians say the "Tudor Revolution" really extended to the end of Elizabeth's reign, when the work was all consolidated. Although the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] declined after the death of Elizabeth, while she was alive it was very effective.

==17th century==
{{main|17th century England}}

===Union of the Crowns===
Elizabeth died in 1603 at the age of 69. Her closest male Protestant relative was the [[King of Scots]], [[King James VI of Scotland|James VI]], of the [[House of Stuart]], who became [[James I of England|King James I of England]] in a [[Union of the Crowns]]. King James I & VI as he was styled became the first monarch to rule the entire island of Great Britain, although it was merely a union of the English and Scottish crowns, and both countries remained separate political entities until 1707. Several assassination attempts were made on James, notably the [[Main Plot]] and [[Bye Plot]]s of 1603, and most famously, on 5 November 1605, the [[Gunpowder Plot]], by a group of Catholic conspirators, led by [[Guy Fawkes]], which caused more antipathy in England towards the Catholic faith. Upon taking power, James immediately made peace with Spain, and for the first half of the 17th century, England remained largely inactive in European politics.

===Colonial England===
In 1607 England built an [[Jamestown Settlement|establishment at Jamestown]] This was the beginning of colonialism by England in North America. Many English settled then in North America for religious or economic reasons. About 70% of migrants from England who came between 1630-1660 were [[indentured servant]]s. By 1700, [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] planters brought in about 100,000 indentured servants,<ref>"[http://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-02-03.htm Africans, Slavery, and Race]". Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).</ref> more than 75% of all European immigrants to Virginia and Maryland.<ref>"[http://www.virtualjamestown.org/essays/horn_essay.html Leaving England: The Social Background of Indentured Servants in the Seventeenth Century]", The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation.</ref> The English merchants holding plantations in the warm southern parts of America then resorted rather quickly to the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and imported Africans in order to cultivate their plantations and sell raw material (particularly [[cotton]] and [[tobacco]]) in Europe. The English merchants involved in colonization amassed fortunes equal to those of great aristocratic landowners in England, and their money, which fuelled the rise of the middle class, permanently altered the balance of political power. The American colonies did not prove profitable to the mother country in the end. Pennsylvania and Delaware were home to a large population of self-sufficient farmers from various parts of Europe, especially Germany. New York traded with pirates and smugglers, and the colonies of New England consistently frustrated the government's attempts to utilize the area's forests for shipbuilding. Only Virginia and the Chesapeake Bay area produced a useful cash crop, tobacco, but it quickly wore the soil out. By the end of the 18th century, the tobacco industry in Virginia had been completely ruined by soil exhaustion and low prices. Indeed, the small sugar-growing islands in the Caribbean were worth more than all of the thirteen colonies put together.

The English colonies did not have an independent foreign policy, but otherwise were mostly left to manage their own affairs. This was very different from the authoritarian control France and Spain held over their colonies. It was the gradual infringement on the rights of the colonies starting in the 1760s that would lead to the American War of Independence. Nothing of the sort would have been possible in the French and Spanish colonies.

[[Image:English civil war map 1642 to 1645.JPG|thumb|Maps of territory held by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] (red) and [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] (green) during the [[English Civil War]] (1642<U+2013>1645)]]

===English Civil War===
{{see|English Civil War}}
The [[First English Civil War]] broke out in 1642, largely as a result of an ongoing series of conflicts between James' son, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], and [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]. The defeat of the Royalist army by the [[New Model Army]] of Parliament at the [[Battle of Naseby]] in June 1645 effectively destroyed the king's forces. Charles surrendered to the Scottish army at Newark. He was eventually handed over to the English Parliament in early 1647. He escaped, and the [[Second English Civil War]] began, although it was a short conflict, with the New Model Army quickly securing the country. The capture and subsequent trial of Charles led to his beheading in January 1649 at [[Whitehall]] Gate in London, making England a [[republic]]. The trial and execution of Charles by his own subjects shocked the rest of Europe (the king argued to the end that only God could judge him) and was a precursor of sorts to the beheading of [[Louis XVI]] 145 years later. 

The New Model Army, under the command of [[Oliver Cromwell]], then scored decisive victories against Royalist armies in Ireland and Scotland. Cromwell was given the title [[Lord Protector]] in 1653, making him 'king in all but name' to his critics. After he died in 1658, his son [[Richard Cromwell]] succeeded him in the office but he was forced to abdicate within a year. For a while it looked as if a new civil war would begin as the New Model Army split into factions. Troops stationed in Scotland under the command of [[George Monck]] eventually marched on London to restore order.

===Restoration of the monarchy===
The monarchy was restored in 1660, with King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] returning to London.
[[Image:Charlesx3.JPG|thumb|[[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], who was beheaded in 1649]]
In 1665, London was swept by a visitation of the [[Great Plague of London|plague]], and then, in 1666, the capital was swept by the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]], which raged for 5 days, destroying approximately 15,000 buildings. After the Restoration, there was an overall reduction in the power of the crown, and by the 18th century England rivaled the Netherlands for being one of the freest countries in Europe.

===Glorious Revolution===
In 1680, the [[Exclusion Bill|Exclusion crisis]] occurred due to widespread objections to a Catholic serving as the King of England, since James was the apparent heir to Charles, who was the king at that time. After the death of Charles II in 1685, his Catholic brother [[James II of England|King James II & VII]] was crowned. From that point, there were various factions pressing for the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Protestant [[William III of England|Prince William of Orange]] and his wife, [[Mary II of England|Mary]], to replace King James II in what became known as the [[Glorious Revolution]]. 

In November 1688, William [[William_III_of_England#Invasion_of_England|landed in England]] with an invading force, and succeeding in being crowned king. After this, James attempted to retake the throne by force in the [[Williamite War]], and was finally defeated by William at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690. 

In December 1689, one of the most important constitutional documents in English history, the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]], was passed.<ref name=vdk114>Van der Kiste, 114<U+2013>115</ref>  The Act, which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right, established restrictions on the [[royal prerogative]].  It provided, amongst other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive [[bail]] or inflict cruel and unusual punishments.<ref name="davies">[[Norman Davies|Davies, Norman]], ''The Isles: A History'' (1999) ISBN 0195134427, p.614.</ref>  William was opposed to the imposition of such constraints, but he chose not to engage in a conflict with Parliament and agreed to abide by the statute.<ref>Troost, 212<U+2013>214</ref>

In parts of Scotland and Ireland, Catholics loyal to James remained determined to see him restored to the throne, and there followed a series of bloody though unsuccessful uprisings. As a result of these, any failure to pledge loyalty to the victorious King William was severely dealt with. The most infamous example of this policy was the [[Massacre of Glencoe]] in 1692. [[Jacobite rebellions]] continued on into the mid-18th century until the son of the last Catholic claimant to the throne, ([[Old Pretender|James III & VIII]]), mounted a final campaign in 1745. The Jacobite forces of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Prince Charles Edward Stuart]], the "Bonnie Prince Charlie" of legend, were defeated at the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746.

==18th and 19th centuries==
{{Main|History of the United Kingdom}}

In the early 18th century, there were roughly 10 million people living in England, and an estimated two million were, <U+201C>vagrants, rogues, prostitutes, beggars or indigents.<U+201D><ref>"[http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/us/chapters/chapter%202.htm Early America 1650-1800]", Boise State University.</ref> In 18th century England, half the population was at least occasionally dependent on charity for subsistence.<ref>"[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=265 Why did the American Revolution take place?]". Digital History.</ref> 

===Formation of the United Kingdom===
The [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] between the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] were a pair of [[Act of Parliament|Parliamentary Acts]] passed by both parliaments in 1707, which dissolved them in order to form a [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] governed by a unified [[Parliament of Great Britain]] according to the [[Treaty of Union]]. The Acts joined the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] (previously separate [[sovereign state|state]]s, with separate legislatures but [[Personal union|with the same monarch]]) into a single [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/ Welcome] parliament.uk, accessed 7 October 2008</ref>

The two countries had shared a monarch since the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, when [[King James VI of Scotland]] inherited the English throne from his double first cousin twice removed, [[Queen Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head. There had been three attempts in 1606, 1667, and 1689 to unite the two countries by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early 18th century that the idea had the will of both political establishments behind them, albeit for rather different reasons.

The Acts took effect on 1 May 1707.  On this date, the Scots Parliament and the English Parliament united to form the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], based in the [[Palace of Westminster]] in [[London]], the home of the English Parliament.<ref>[[s:Act of Union 1707|Act of Union 1707]],  Article 3</ref> Hence, the Acts are referred to as the '''Union of the Parliaments'''. On the Union, historian [[Simon Schama]] said "What began as a hostile merger, would end in a full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world ... it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history."<ref>{{cite episode |title=Britannia Incorporated|series= A History of Britain |serieslink= Simon Schama's A History of Britain |credits= [[Simon Schama]] (presenter) |network= [[BBC One]] |airdate= 2001-05-22 |number=10 |minutes=3}}</ref>

In 1714, the reign of [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] ended. Anne was the last monarch of the [[House of Stuart]]. She was succeeded by her [[second cousin]], [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], of the [[House of Hanover]], who was a descendant of the Stuarts through his maternal grandmother, [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]], daughter of [[James I of England|James VI & I]].<ref name="Lodge78">Lodge (1832), pp. 7<U+2013>8</ref> A series of [[Jacobite rebellions]] broke out in an attempt to restore the Stuart monarchy, but all ultimately failed. Several [[Invasion of Great Britain|Planned French Invasions]] were attempted, also with the intention of placing the Stuarts on the throne.
[[Image:coaltub.png|right|160px|thumb|The first general laws against child labour, the [[Factory Acts]], were passed in Britain in the first half of the 19th century. Children younger than nine were not allowed to work and the work day of youth under the age of 18 was limited to twelve hours.<ref>[http://www.victorianweb.org/history/workers1.html The Life of the Industrial Worker in Nineteenth-Century England] Laura Del Col, West Virginia University</ref>]]
The [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] of 1800 formally assimilated Ireland within the British political process and from 1 January 1801  created a new [[Sovereign state|state]] called the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], which united the Kingdom of Great Britain with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] to form a single political entity. The English capital of London was adopted as the capital of the Union.

===Industrial Revolution===
{{main|Economic history of Britain}}
During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, there was considerable social upheaval as a largely agrarian society was transformed by technological advances and increasing mechanization, which was the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Much of the agricultural workforce was uprooted from the countryside and moved into large urban centres of production, as the steam-based production factories could undercut the traditional [[cottage industries]], because of economies of scale and the increased output per worker made possible by the new technologies. The consequent overcrowding into areas with little supporting infrastructure saw dramatic increases in the rate of infant mortality (to the extent that many Sunday schools for pre-working age children (5 or 6) had funeral clubs to pay for each others funeral arrangements), crime, and social deprivation. 

The transition to industrialization was not wholly seamless for workers, many of whom saw their livelihoods threatened by the process. Of these, some frequently sabotaged or attempted to sabotage factories. These saboteurs were known as "[[Luddism|Luddites]]".

==20th and 21st centuries==
=== Political issues===
Following years of political and military agitation for 'Home Rule' for Ireland, the Anglo-Irish treaty of 1921 established the [[Irish Free State]] (now the [[Republic of Ireland]]) as a separate state, leaving [[Northern Ireland]] as part of the United Kingdom. The official name of the UK thus became "The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]".

England, as part of the UK, joined the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973, which became the [[European Union]] in 1993.
