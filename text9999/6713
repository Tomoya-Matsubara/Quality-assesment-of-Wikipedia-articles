'''Jeffery Todd Banister''' (born January 15, 1964) is a former American [[professional baseball]] player and current manager of the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] of [[Major League Baseball]]. Before joining the Rangers, Banister spent 29 years within the organization of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] as a player and coach in both the Pirates' major and minor league system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/ron-cook/2014/09/24/Ron-Cook-A-toast-to-the-Pirates-improbable-2014-postseason-push/stories/201409240157|title=Ron Cook: A toast to the Pirates' improbable 2014 postseason push|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}</ref>

Banister played baseball at [[La Marque High School]] in [[La Marque, Texas]]. He developed [[bone cancer]] in his sophomore year, which almost necessitated the [[amputation]] of his leg. While playing [[college baseball]] for [[Lee College]], he suffered a [[home plate]] collision that broke three [[vertebrae]] in his neck, leaving him paralyzed for ten days. After rehabilitating, he was named a [[Junior College]] [[All-America]]n the next season, and received a scholarship to the [[University of Houston]], to play for the [[Houston Cougars baseball]] team. He was then [[draft (sports)|drafted]] by the Pirates in 1986. After playing in [[Minor League Baseball]], he appeared in a major league game on July 23, 1991, recording a [[hit (baseball)|hit]] in his only [[plate appearance]]. He did not appear in another major league game, and ended his playing career after the 1993 season.

Following his playing career, Banister remained with the Pirates. He served as a manager for their Minor League Baseball affiliates from 1994 through 1998, and then as a minor league and major league field coordinator until 2010. The Pirates considered him for their managerial vacancy before the 2011 season, but hired him as their [[Coach (baseball)#Bench coach|bench coach]]. He served in the role through the 2014 season. The Rangers hired Banister as their manager during the 2014<U+2013>15 offseason.

==Playing career==

===Amateur career===
Banister attended [[La Marque High School]] in [[La Marque, Texas]].<ref name=short>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&dat=19910728&id=1DxSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qTYNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2748,5323453|title=Banister's dream short-lived|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=July 28, 1991|page=2B|newspaper=[[The Victoria Advocate]]|location=[[Victoria, Texas]]|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}</ref> At La Marque, Banister played for the school's [[baseball]], [[basketball]], and [[American football]] teams. During his sophomore year of high school, Banister injured his right ankle while playing baseball. During an examination of his ankle, which was slow to heal, he was diagnosed with [[bone cancer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&dat=19910726&id=_rYiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JbUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1581,4172061|title=Bucs' Banister an amazing study in courage|first=John|last=Perrotto|date=July 26, 1991|page=C1|newspaper=[[Beaver County Times]]|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}</ref> He had developed [[cyst]]s that required [[skin grafting]] to treat. An infection in his leg led to the development of [[osteomyelitis]], which spread from his right ankle to just below his knee. Doctors recommended [[amputation]] in order to save the rest of his leg, but Banister refused, as he hoped he would be able to continue his baseball career. Doctors performed seven operations on his leg, which saved it from being amputated.<ref name=finally/><ref name=nyt>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/sports/baseball/in-dugout-a-grinder-who-never-gave-in.html?_r=1&|title=On Baseball; In Dugout, a Grinder Who Never Gave In|first=Tyler|last=Kepner|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 9, 2013|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}</ref> In his senior year, Banister suffered a knee injury playing American football, which nearly led to him being cut from the baseball team due to his decreased mobility. His father suggested he change positions and become a [[catcher]], which allowed him to remain on the baseball team.<ref name=short/>

At a tryout conducted by professional [[scout (sports)|scouts]], Banister was noticed by the coaches at [[Lee College]], a [[junior college]] in [[Baytown, Texas]]. They recruited Banister to play [[college baseball]] at Lee.<ref name=finally/> While catching in a 1983 game, he suffered a collision at [[home plate]], where the [[baserunner]] attempted to jump over him, and hit Banister in the head with his knee. The collision broke three of the [[vertebrae]] in his neck. Banister was not originally scheduled to play in that game; a scout for the [[New York Yankees]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) told Lee's coach that he hoped to see Banister catch, which resulted in Banister being added to the [[starting lineup]] in a last-minute change. As a result of the collision, Banister was [[paralysis|paralyzed]] from the neck down for ten days. Doctors initially warned him that he may never walk again. He had another three operations performed on his back and learned how to walk again during the 1984 season. Entering the hospital weighing {{convert|225|lbs}}, he weighed {{convert|139|lbs}} when he was discharged. Banister recovered and played another season for Lee in 1985, and was named a Junior College [[All-America]]n. He transferred to [[University of Houston]] after the season to play for the [[Houston Cougars baseball]] team on a scholarship in 1986.<ref name=finally/><ref name=nyt/><ref name=fire/>
