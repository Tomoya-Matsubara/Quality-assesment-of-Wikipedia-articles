'''''Roma''''', named after [[Italian battleship Roma|two previous ships]] and the city of [[Rome]],{{#tag:ref|In [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], the city's name is ''Roma''. {{IPA-it|<U+02C8>ro<U+02D0>ma}}. While nominally the battleship were named for the ships and the city, Whitley claims that the name was also motivated by symbolism; when together, the choice of "''Roma''" and "''Impero''" (English: ''Empire'') for the new battleships was meant to commemorate the [[King of Italy]]'s crowning as the Emperor of [[Ethiopia]] in 1936 after the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]].<ref name="Whitley171">Whitley, ''Battleships of World War II'', 171</ref>|group=N}} was the fourth [[Vittorio Veneto class battleship|''Vittorio Veneto'']]-[[ship class|class]] [[battleship]] of Italy's ''[[Regia Marina]]'' ({{lang-en|Royal Navy}}). The construction of both ''Roma'' and her [[sister ship]] {{Ship|Italian battleship|Impero||2}} was planned due to rising tensions around the world and the navy's fear that two ''Vittorio Veneto''s and the older pre-[[World War I|First World War]] battleships were not enough to counter the British and French Mediterranean Fleets. As ''Roma'' was laid down almost four years after the first two ships of the class, some small improvements were made to the design, including additional [[Freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] added to the bow.

''Roma'' was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the ''Regia Marina'' on 14 June 1942, but a severe fuel shortage in Italy at that time prevented her from being deployed; instead, along with her sister ships [[Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto|''Vittorio Veneto'']] and [[Italian battleship Littorio|''Littorio'']], she was used to bolster the anti-aircraft defenses of various Italian cities. In this role, she was severely damaged twice in June 1943 from [[bomber]] raids on [[La Spezia]]. After repairs in [[Genoa]] through all of July and part of August, ''Roma'' was deployed as the flagship of Admiral [[Carlo Bergamini (admiral)|Carlo Bergamini]] in a large battle group that eventually comprised the three ''Vittorio Veneto''s, eight cruisers and eight destroyers. Their stated intent was attacking the Allied ships approaching [[Salerno]] to invade Italy ([[Allied invasion of Italy|Operation "Avalanche"]]) but, in reality, the Italian fleet was sailing to [[Malta]] to surrender following Italy's [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|September 8, 1943]] armistice with the Allies.

While the force was in the [[Strait of Bonifacio]], [[Dornier Do 217]]s of the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]''&mdash;armed with [[Fritz X]] radio-controlled bombs&mdash;sighted the force. The first attack failed, but the second dealt ''Italia'' (ex-''Littorio'') and ''Roma'' much damage. The hit on ''Roma'' caused water to flood two boiler rooms and the after engine room, leaving the ship to limp along with two propellers, reduced power, and [[Electric arc|arc]]-induced fires in the stern of the ship. Shortly thereafter, another bomb slammed into the ship which detonated within the forward engine room, causing catastrophic flooding and the explosion of the #2 main turret's [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]], throwing the turret itself into the sea. Sinking by the bow and leaning to starboard, ''Roma'' [[capsize]]d and broke in two, carrying 1253 men&mdash;including Bergamini&mdash;down with her.

== Background ==
:''For additional information, see [[Vittorio Veneto class battleship|''Vittorio Veneto'' class battleship]]''
The Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]] did not authorize any large naval rearmament until 1933. Once he did, two old battleships of the {{Sclass|Conte di Cavour|battleship|4}} were sent to be modernized in the same year, and {{Ship|Italian battleship|Vittorio Veneto||2}} and {{Ship|Italian battleship|Littorio||2}} were laid down in 1934. In May 1935, the Italian Naval Ministry began preparing for a five-year naval building program that would include four battleships, three [[aircraft carrier]]s, four cruisers, fifty-four submarines, and forty smaller ships. In December 1935, Admiral [[Domenico Cavagnari]] proposed to Mussolini that, among other things, two more battleships of the ''Vittorio Veneto'' class be built to attempt to counter a possible Franco-British alliance&mdash;if the two countries combined forces, they would easily outnumber the Italian fleet. Mussolini postponed his decision, but later authorized planning for the two ships in January 1937. In December, they were approved and money was appropriated for them; they were [[ship naming and launching|named]] ''Roma'' and {{Ship|Italian battleship|Impero||2}} (English: ''Empire'').<ref name="Knox20">Knox, ''Mussolini Unleashed'', 20</ref><ref name="G&D404">Garzke and Dulin, ''Axis and Neutral Battleships'', 404</ref>

Laid down nearly four years after ''Vittorio Veneto'' and ''Littorio'', ''Roma'' was able to incorporate a few design improvements. Her bow was noticeably redesigned to give ''Roma'' additional [[Freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]]; partway into construction, it was modified on the basis of experience with ''Vittorio Veneto'' so that it had had a finer end at the waterline. She was also equipped with 32 rather than 24, {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}}/65 [[caliber#caliber as measurement of length|caliber]] [[Breda]] guns.<ref>Garzke and Dulin, ''Axis and Neutral Battleships'', 418&ndash;419, 426, 428</ref><ref name="Whitley171-172">Whitley, ''Battleships of World War II'', 171&ndash;172</ref>{{#tag:ref|Whitley states that ''Roma'' was completed with 28 20&nbsp;mm guns and the other two were originally equipped with 16, but Garzke and Dulin give 32 and 24.<ref name="Whitley171-172"/><ref>Garzke and Dulin, ''Axis and Neutral Battleships'', 418&ndash;419</ref>|group=N}}

== Construction and commissioning ==
''Roma''{{'}}s [[keel]] was laid by the Italian shipbuilder ''[[Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico]]'' on 18 September 1938 and she was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 9 June 1940. After just over two years of [[fitting-out]], the new battleship was commissioned into the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' on 14 June 1942. She arrived in the major naval base of [[Taranto]] on 21 August of the same year and was assigned to the Ninth Naval Division.<ref name="G&D404"/>

Although ''Roma'' took part in training exercises and was moved to various bases including Taranto, [[Naples]] and [[La Spezia]], in the next year, she did not go on any combat missions as the Italian Navy was desperately short of fuel. In fact, by the end of 1942, the only combat-ready battleships in the navy were the three ''Vittorio Veneto''s because the fuel shortage had caused the four modernized battleships to be removed from service. When combined with a lack of capable vessels to escort the [[capital ship]]s, the combat potential of the Italian Navy was virtually non-existent. On 6 December she was transferred with ''Vittorio Veneto'' and ''Littorio'' from Taranto to La Spezia, where she became the [[flagship]] of the ''Regia Marina''. They remained here through the first half of 1943 without going on any operations.<ref name="G&D392,404">Garzke and Dulin, ''Axis and Neutral Battleships'', 392 and 404</ref><ref name="W178">Whitley, ''Battleships of World War II'', 178</ref>

During this time, La Spezia was attacked many times by Allied [[bomber]] groups. Attacks on 14 and 19 April 1943 did not hit ''Roma'', but an American raid on 5 June severely damaged both ''Vittorio Veneto'' and ''Roma''. [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] aircraft carrying {{convert|908|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[armor-piercing]] bombs damaged the stationary battleships with two bombs each. ''Roma'' suffered from two near hits on either side of her bow. The starboard-side bomb hit the ship but passed through the side of the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] before exploding. The ship began taking on water through leaks from frames 221 to 226<U+2014>an area covering about {{convert|32|sqft|sqm|lk=on}}<U+2014>and through flooding from the bow to frame 212. The second bomb missed but exploded in the water near the hull. Leaks were discovered over a {{convert|30|sqft|sqm|abbr=on}} area ranging from frames 198 and 207. Approximately {{convert|2350|LT|ST t|lk=on}} of water entered the ship.<ref>Garzke and Dulin, ''Axis and Neutral Battleships'', 392, 403&ndash;404</ref>

''Roma'' was damaged again by two bombs in another raid on 23&ndash;24 June. One hit the ship aft and to starboard of the rear main battery turret and obliterated several staterooms, which were promptly flooded from broken piping. The second landed atop the rear turret itself, but little damage was suffered due to the heavy armor in that location. This attack did not seriously damage ''Roma'' or cause any flooding, but she nevertheless sailed to Genoa for repairs. ''Roma'' reached the city on 1 July and returned to La Spezia on 13 August once repairs were complete.<ref name="G&D404"/>

=== Loss ===
Along with many of the principal units of the Italian fleet&mdash;including ''Vittorio Veneto'' and ''Italia'' (the ex-''Littorio''){{#tag:ref|''Littorio'' had been renamed on 25 July 1943 soon after the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)#"Badoglio government"|fall of Mussolini and the Fascist Party]].<ref>Garzke and Dulin, ''Axis and Neutral Battleships'', 403</ref>|group=N}}&mdash;the cruisers {{Ship|Italian cruiser|Eugenio di Savoia||2}}, {{Ship|Italian cruiser|Raimondo Montecuccoli||2}}, and {{Ship|Italian cruiser|Emanuele Filiberto Duca d'Aosta||2}}, and eight destroyers&mdash;''Roma'' sailed from La Spezia as the flagship of Admiral [[Carlo Bergamini (admiral)|Carlo Bergamini]] on 9 September 1943, a day after the proclamation of the 1943 Italian [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|armistice]]. Joined by three additional cruisers from Genoa, {{Ship|Italian cruiser|Duca degli Abruzzi||2}}, {{Ship|Italian cruiser|Giuseppe Garibaldi||2}}, and {{Ship|Italian cruiser|Attilio Regolo||2}}, the fleet first sailed towards [[Salerno]] in a deliberate diversion to convince the Germans that they were going to attack the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] ships sailing to invade Italy as part of [[Allied invasion of Italy|Operation "Avalanche"]]. However, the Italian fleet was actually intending to break course and steam towards the British island of [[Malta]] to surrender. When Germany learned of the betrayal, the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' sent [[Dornier Do 217]]s armed with [[Fritz X]] radio-controlled bombs to attack the ships. These aircraft caught up with the force when it was in the [[Strait of Bonifacio]].<ref name="W178"/><ref name="G&D405">Garzke and Dulin, ''Axis and Neutral Battleships'', 405</ref><ref>Wade, ''A Midshipman's War'', 225</ref>
[[File:Fritz X side.jpg|thumb|alt=A grey missile sitting on a light-colored floor|A Fritz X radio-controlled bomb]]

The Do 217s trailed the fleet for some time, but the Italian fleet did not open fire upon sighting them; they were trailing the fleet at such a distance that it was impossible to identify them as Allied or Axis, and Bergamini believed that they were the air cover promised to them by the Allies. However, an attack upon ''Italia'' and ''Roma'' at 1537 spurred the fleet into action, as the anti-aircraft batteries onboard opened fire and all ships began evasive maneuvers. About fifteen minutes after this, ''Italia'' was hit on the starboard side underneath her fore main turrets, while ''Roma'' was hit on the same side somewhere between frames 100 and 108. This bomb passed through the ship and exploded beneath the ships' [[keel]], damaging the hull girder and allowing water to flood the after engine room and two boiler rooms. The flooding caused the inboard propellers to stop for want of power and started a large amount of [[Electric arc|arcing]], which itself caused many electrical fires in the aft half of the ship.<ref name="G&D407">Garzke and Dulin, ''Axis and Neutral Battleships'', 407</ref>

Losing power and speed, ''Roma'' began to fall out of the battle group. Around 16:02, another Fritz X slammed into the starboard side of the ''Roma''{{'}}s deck, between frames 123 and 136. It most likely detonated in the forward engine room, sparking flames, and causing heavy flooding in the [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]] of [[main battery]] turret number two and the fore port side secondary battery turret, and putting even more pressure upon the previously stressed hull girder. Seconds after the initial blast, the number two 15&nbsp;in turret was blown over the side by a massive explosion, this time from the detonation of that turret's magazines.<ref name="G&D407"/>

This caused additional catastrophic flooding in the bow, and the battleship began to go down by the bow while leaning more and more to starboard. The ship quickly [[capsize]]d and broke in two. The ship had a crew of 1,849 when she sailed; 596 survived with 1,253 men going down with ''Roma''. In her 15-month service life, ''Roma'' made 20 sorties, mostly in transfers between bases (none were to go into combat), covering {{convert|2492|mi|km|abbr=on}} and using {{convert|3320|t|LT ST}} of fuel oil in 133 hours of sailing.<ref name="G&D410">Garzke and Dulin, ''Axis and Neutral Battleship'', 410</ref>
