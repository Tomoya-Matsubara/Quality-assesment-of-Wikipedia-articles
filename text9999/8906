'''''Zoogoneticus tequila''''', '''Tequila Splitfin''' or simply '''Tequila fish''', is a species of goodeid fish (family [[Goodeidae]]).<ref>{{ITIS|id=646978 |taxon=''Zoogoneticus tequila''}}</ref> The specific epithet, ''[[tequila]]'', derives from the [[Tequila Volcano]], which looms near the type locality.<ref name=WebbMiller>{{cite journal |last1=Webb |first1=S.

Its current distribution is restricted to a single spring pool in [[Teuchitl<U+00E1>n]], only {{convert|4|m}} in diameter, where a population consisting of less than 50 adult fish live.<ref name=TFoW>{{cite doi |10.1023/A:1026040727808}}</ref> Even in this habitat, it is outnumbered by introduced [[guppy|guppies]] by a factor of six.<ref>{{cite doi |10.1023/A:1024155731112}}</ref> Before the discovery of the pool population in 2000/2001, ''Zoogoneticus tequila'' was generally thought to inhabit rivers; however, no fish could be found in the original habitat and the species was considered [[Extinct in the Wild|extinct in the wild]].<ref name=IUCN/> Introduced fish species have been implicated in the disappearance of ''Zoogoneticus tequila'' from its type locality.<ref name=TFoW/>

Along with other Mexican goodeids, ''Zoogoneticus tequila'' are [[viviparous]]; this lead the genus to be originally included in family [[Poeciliidae]]. Males are smaller than females, with [[standard length]] up to 41 mm in males and up to 58 mm in females. The sexes can also be distinguished by colouration.<ref name=WebbMiller/>
