'''June Lascelles''' (23 January 1924 <U+2013> 15 July 2004) was an Australian [[microbiologist]]. She is best known for pioneering work in microbial [[photosynthesis]].

==Early life==
June was born and raised in [[Sydney]], Australia. She attended the [[University of Sydney]] and received a BSc in Biochemistry in 1944. She remained there as a research scholar and teaching fellow and later, a [[Linnean Society of New South Wales|Linnaean Maceay]] fellow, receiving her MSc in 1947.<ref name="biochemist">{{cite web

==Scientific career==

Lascelles began her research in microbiology, a field in which she remained for her entire career. Her initial research was focused on the metabolism of molecular hydrogen in ''E. coli''. She excelled in her work; so much so that in 1947 she was awarded the prestigious [[1851 Research Fellowship|Royal Exhibition of 1851 Overseas Research Fellowship]]. She chose to move to the UK, joining the microbiology unit of the biochemistry lab at [[Oxford University]] under [[Donald Devereux Woods]]. Here, Lascelles made several important contributions to the field of microbiology, especially in the metabolism and synthesis of enzymes in bacteria.<ref name="biochemist" /> Lascelles and [[William R. Sistron]] were credited with applying the emerging technology of pre-molecular genetics to the biosynthesis of the pigments called [[bacteriochlorophyll]].<ref name=smith>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=edited by Margaret C.M.|title=Genetic methods for diverse prokaryotes|date=1999|publisher=Academic|location=San Diego, Calif.|isbn=0080860583|page=434|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?isbn=0080860583|coauthors=Sockett, R. Elizabeth}}</ref>  In 1979 she became a Professor Emeritus at the University of California.<ref name=mem/>

She was awarded her [[D.Phil]] in 1952, and continued her work at Oxford. In 1956, she was awarded a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] fellowship, and went to [[Stanford University]] for a year to work with [[C. B. van Niel]] at the Hopkins Marine Station.<ref>{{cite web

The work she did during this period contributed to several impressive discoveries such as dispelling the previously-thought rule that anaerobes do not have [[cytochrome]]s, and the provision of a soluble [[3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase|<U+03B2>-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase]], which allowed [[Hans Adolf Krebs|Krebs]]<U+2019> group to devise a now widely-used assay for ketone bodies.<ref name="biochemist"/>

In 1960, she was appointed University Lecturer in Microbiology at Oxford, a post she held until 1965. In 1964, while on a year<U+2019>s leave, she became a visiting Professor of Bacteriology at [[UCLA]]; a role which was made permanent in 1965. These years were some of the most productive in her career, and her work provided the basis of understanding of [[tetrapyrrole]] synthesis in photosynthetic bacteria which holds tested and true even today.<ref name="biochemist" />

==Honours and awards==

Lascelles was a member of the [[Biochemical Society]] from 1947-2002 and served on the [[Biochemical Journal]] editorial board from 1959-1966.<ref name=book/> She also served on the editorial boards of the [[Journal of Bacteriology]], the [[Journal of General Microbiology]] and the Archives of Microbiology.<ref name=book/> In 1990 she was elected a Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].<ref name=mem>[http://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/inmemoriam/junelascelles.htm In memorium], University of California, retrieved 16 March 2014</ref> Additionally, she was one of the editors in the 1973 book Microbial Photosynthesis.<ref name=book>{{cite book |last=Lascelles |first=June |year=1973 |title=Microbial Photosynthesis Vol 4 |url= |location= |publisher=Dowden,Hutchinson & Ross Inc. |isbn= 9780879330491 |accessdate= }}</ref>

==Later life and death==

Lascelles retired in 1989, but continued to work daily until two years before her death. She was a private and modest woman, but always forthright and plain speaking. She is best remembered for her generosity to young scientists, being approachable and giving wise council. Upon her passing, she was described by a colleague as <U+201C>an accomplished scholar, dedicated learner, highly respected experimentalist, unique role model and rare friend<U+201D>.<ref name="biochemist" />
