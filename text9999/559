'''''Sherlock''''' is a British television [[crime drama]] that presents a contemporary update of Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s [[Sherlock Holmes]] detective stories. It stars [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as Holmes and [[Martin Freeman]] as [[Doctor Watson|Doctor John Watson]]. [[List of Sherlock episodes|Six episodes]], broadcast since 2010, have been produced, with three more episodes scheduled to begin production in March 2013. The series has been sold to over 180 territories.

The show was conceived by [[Steven Moffat]] and [[Mark Gatiss]] during train journeys to and from the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' production base in [[Cardiff]], where they were both writers. They aspired to produce a modern-day version of Conan Doyle's stories in which Sherlock uses the technologies that are available to him today in order to find things out and solve crime. Credited as co-creators, Moffat and Gatiss each write one episode per series, with the other written by [[Stephen Thompson (writer)|Steve Thompson]]. [[Hartswood Films]] produced the series for the [[BBC]] and co-produced it with [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] Boston for its ''[[Masterpiece (TV series)|Masterpiece]]'' [[anthology series]]. The series is primarily filmed in Cardiff, although the production also uses a variety of other locations. [[North Gower Street]] in [[London]] was used for exterior shots of Holmes and Watson's [[221B Baker Street]] residence.

''Sherlock'' depicts "consulting detective" Holmes, assisting the [[Metropolitan Police Service]], primarily [[Inspector Lestrade|DI Greg Lestrade]] ([[Rupert Graves]]), in solving various crimes. Holmes is assisted by his flatmate, Dr John Watson, who has returned from military service in [[Afghanistan]]. Although the series depicts a variety of crimes and perpetrators, Holmes' conflict with his nemesis [[Professor Moriarty|Jim Moriarty]] ([[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]]) is a recurring feature. Pathologist Molly Hooper ([[Louise Brealey]]) assists Holmes in her laboratory. Other recurring roles include [[Una Stubbs]] as [[Mrs. Hudson]], Holmes and Watson's landlady; [[Vinette Robinson]] as Sgt. Sally Donovan; and Mark Gatiss as Sherlock's brother, [[Mycroft Holmes]].

After an unbroadcast pilot in 2009, the first series of three 90-minute episodes was transmitted on [[BBC One]] and [[BBC HD]] in 2010, with a second series of three episodes first broadcast in 2012. Critical reception was overwhelmingly positive, with many reviews commending the quality of the writing, performances and direction. ''Sherlock'' has been [[List of awards and nominations received by Sherlock|nominated for numerous awards]], including [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA]]s and [[Emmy Awards|Emmys]], winning several across a variety of categories. All six episodes have been released on DVD and [[Blu-ray]] Disc in the United Kingdom, alongside [[tie-in]] editions of some of Conan Doyle's original books. Soundtrack albums from each series have also been released.

Gatiss has criticised recent television adaptations of the Conan Doyle stories as "too reverential and too slow", aiming instead to be as irreverent to the [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] as the [[Sherlock Holmes (1939 film series)|1930s and 1940s films]] starring [[Basil Rathbone]].<ref name="thorpe"/>  Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock uses modern technology, such as texting, the internet, and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], to solve crimes.<ref name="thorpe"/> [[Paul McGuigan (filmmaker)|Paul McGuigan]], who directed two episodes of ''Sherlock'', says that this is in keeping with Conan Doyle's character, pointing out that "[i]n the books he would use any device possible and he was always in the lab doing experiments.

The update maintains some traditional elements of the stories, such as the [[221B Baker Street|Baker Street address]] and Holmes's archenemy [[Professor Moriarty|Moriarty]].<ref name="telegraph19122008"/> Although the events of the books are transferred to the present day, canonical elements are incorporated into the story. For example, Martin Freeman's Watson has returned from military service in [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite news|author=AP|date= 16 August 2009|url= http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/2009/08/16/life-outside-the-office-for-martin-freeman-91466-24449418/|title= Life outside The Office for Martin Freeman|work= Wales on Sunday|publisher= Western Mail and Echo}}</ref> While discussing the fact that the original Watson was invalided home after serving in the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] (1878<U+2013>1880), Gatiss realised that "[i]t is the same war now, I thought.

''Sherlock'' was announced as a single 60-minute drama production at the [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]] in August 2008,<ref name=Parker/> with broadcast set for mid to late 2009.<ref name="telegraph19122008"/> The intention was to produce a series of six 60-minute episodes should the pilot prove to be successful.<ref name="s1ep1-comm"/><ref name="telegraph19122008">{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3852882/BBC-to-make-a-modern-day-Sherlock-Holmes.html |title=BBC to make a modern-day Sherlock Holmes |date=19 December 2008 |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=20 July 2010}}</ref> However, the first version of the pilot<U+2014>reported by ''[[The Guardian]]'' to have cost <U+00A3>800,000<U+2014>led to rumours within the [[BBC]] and wider media that ''Sherlock'' was a potential disaster.<ref name="Mail-yearend"/><ref name="lawson-rebirth">{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Lawson |authorlink=Mark Lawson |title=The rebirth of Sherlock |date=2 September 2010  |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/sep/02/sherlock-mark-lawson |work=The Guardian |accessdate=7 September 2010}}</ref> The BBC decided not to transmit the pilot, requesting a reshoot and a total of three 90-minute episodes.<ref name="Mail-yearend">{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/dec/26/christmas-tv-replay-2010-downloads|title=Replay the best of 2010|last=Heritage|first=Stuart|date=24 December 2010|work=The Guardian |accessdate=18 January 2011}}</ref><ref name="lawson-rebirth"/> The original pilot was included on the DVD of the first series.

=== Cast and characters ===

Moffat and Vertue became interested in casting Cumberbatch as the title character after watching his performance in the 2007 drama/war film ''[[Atonement (film)|Atonement]]''. The actor was cast after [[audition|reading the script]] for the creative team.<ref name="unlocking">"Unlocking Sherlock", documentary included on the Series 1 DVD/Blu-Ray release</ref> "Cumberbatch", says ''[[The Guardian]]'', "has a reputation for playing odd, brilliant men very well, and his Holmes is cold, techie, slightly [[Asperger syndrome|Aspergerish]]."<ref name="Mitchison">{{cite news |first=Amanda |last=Mitchison |title=Benedict Cumberbatch on playing Sherlock Holmes |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/jul/17/benedict-cumberbatch-sherlock-holmes |work=The Guardian  |date=17 July 2010 |accessdate=18 July 2010}}</ref> Cumberbatch said, "There's a great charge you get from playing him, because of the volume of words in your head and the speed of thought<U+2014>you really have to make your connections incredibly fast. He is one step ahead of the audience, and of anyone around him with normal intellect. They can't quite fathom where his leaps are taking him."<ref name="Mitchison"/> [[Piers Wenger]], Head of Drama at [[BBC Wales]], described the series' rendering of Sherlock as "a dynamic [[superhero]] in a modern world, an arrogant, genius sleuth driven by a desire to prove himself cleverer than the perpetrator and the police<U+2014>everyone in fact."<ref name="telegraph19122008"/> Addressing changing social attitudes and broadcasting regulations, Cumberbatch's Holmes replaced the [[Pipe smoking|pipe]] with multiple [[nicotine patches]].<ref name="herald"/> The writers believed that Sherlock should not talk like "a completely modern person", says Moffat, but were initially intent that "he never sounded like he's giving a lecture." However, Moffat turned the character "more Victorian" in the second series, capitalising more on Cumberbatch's "beautiful voice" to make it sound like "he's giving a lecture".<ref name="ds-moff-trf"/>

In an interview with ''[[The Observer]]'', co-creator Mark Gatiss says that they experienced more difficulty finding the right actor to play [[Doctor Watson|Dr. John Watson]] than they had for the title character.<ref name="thorpe"/> Producer Sue Vertue said, "Benedict was the only person we actually saw for [the part of] Sherlock... Once Benedict was there it was really just making sure we got the chemistry for John [Watson]<U+2014>and I think you get it as soon as they come into the room, you can see that they work together".<ref name="guard-renew"/> Several actors auditioned for the part of Watson,<ref name="s1ep1-comm"/> and Martin Freeman eventually took the role. Steven Moffat said that [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] was the first to audition unsuccessfully. He was rejected for being too "barmy", as the producers required someone "straighter" for Watson.<ref name="mattsmith">{{cite news|last= French |first=Dan|date= 4 February 2010|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s7/doctorwho/news/a201372/matt-smith-rejected-for-bbcs-sherlock.html|title= Matt Smith rejected for BBC's 'Sherlock'|publisher= Digital Spy|accessdate=4 February 2010}}</ref> Shortly after, Moffat cast Smith as the [[Eleventh Doctor]] in ''[[Doctor Who]]''.<ref name="mattsmith"/>

The writers said that Freeman's casting developed the way in which Cumberbatch played Holmes.<ref name="s1ep1-comm"/> The theme of "friendship" appealed to both Gatiss and Moffat.<ref name="moff-study">Moffat, Steven "Introduction" In: {{cite book |title=Sherlock: A Study in Scarlet|first=Arthur |last=Conan Doyle |publisher=Random House |year=2011|pages=xi<U+2013>xii |isbn=1-84990-366-2}}</ref> Gatiss asserted the importance of achieving the correct tone for the character. "Watson is not an idiot, although it's true that Conan Doyle always took the piss out of him," said Gatiss. "But only an idiot would surround himself with idiots."<ref name="thorpe"/> Moffat said that Freeman is "the sort of opposite of Benedict in everything except the amount of talent... Martin finds a sort of poetry in the ordinary man. I love the fastidious realism of everything he does."<ref name="s1ep1-comm"/> Freeman describes his character as Sherlock's "moral compass" because the eponymous character doesn't always consider the morality and ethics of his actions.<ref name="unlocking"/>

[[Rupert Graves]] was cast as [[Inspector Lestrade|DI Greg Lestrade]]. The writers referred to the character as "Inspector Lestrade" during development until Gatiss realised that in contemporary England the character would have the title "Detective Inspector". Moffat and Gatiss pointed out that Lestrade does not appear often in the stories and is quite inconsistent in them. They decided to go with the version who appeared in "[[The Six Napoleons]]": a man who is frustrated by Holmes but admires him, and whom Holmes considers as the best person at [[Scotland Yard]].<ref name="s1ep1-comm"/> Several candidates took a comedic tack in their auditions, but the creative team preferred the gravitas that Graves brought to the role.<ref name="s1ep1-comm"/> His first name is revealed to be Greg in "The Hounds of Baskerville."<ref name="s2ep2">{{cite episode |title=The Hounds of Baskerville |series=Sherlock |credits=wr. Mark Gatiss, dir. Paul McGuigan  |network=BBC |airdate=8 January 2012 |seriesno=2 |number=2}}</ref>

[[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]] made his first appearance as [[Professor Moriarty|Jim Moriarty]] in "The Great Game". Moffat said, "We knew what we wanted to do with Moriarty from the very beginning. Moriarty is usually a rather dull, rather posh villain so we thought someone who was genuinely properly frightening. Someone who's an absolute psycho."<ref name="guard-renew"/>  Moffat and Gatiss were originally not going to put a confrontation into these three episodes between Moriarty and Sherlock but realised that they "just had to do a confrontation scene. We had to do a version of the scene in '[[The Final Problem]]' in which the two archenemies meet each other."<ref name="s1ep3-comm"/>

The remainder of the regular cast includes [[Una Stubbs]] as [[Mrs. Hudson]] and co-creator [[Mark Gatiss]] as [[Mycroft Holmes]].<ref name="bbcpressep2">{{cite web |title=Network TV BBC Week 31: Sunday 1&nbsp;August 2010 |work=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/tv/2010/wk31/sun.shtml#sun_sherlock |accessdate=18 July 2010}}</ref> [[Vinette Robinson]], [[Jonathan Aris]] and [[Louise Brealey]] play the recurring roles of Sergeant Sally Donovan, Anderson and Molly Hooper, respectively.

The writers say that they did not want to force modernity onto the story.<ref name="s1ep1-comm"/> There were some creative challenges, such as the decision to include the sign "221B" on Holmes' front door. Gatiss and Moffat reflect that in the modern world the door would only display the number of the house, and there would be doorbells for each flat. The full house number is so iconic that they felt unable to change it.<ref name="s1ep1-comm"/> The writers also decided that the lead characters would address each other by their first names, rather than the traditional Holmes and Watson.<ref name="s1ep1-comm"/> This was also reflected in the title of the series. Director Paul McGuigan came up with the idea of putting text messages on the screen instead of having cut-away shots of a hand holding the phone.<ref name="s1ep1-comm"/>

The producers found it difficult to coordinate the schedules of the principal players and Moffat and Gatiss for a second series. Cumberbatch and Freeman both worked on the 2012 film ''[[The Hobbit (2012 film)|The Hobbit]]'', and Moffat continued as ''Doctor Who''{{'}}s head writer. In response to the time pressure, ''The Guardian'' asserted, the series "features reworkings of three of Conan Doyle's most recognised tales".<ref name="guard171211"/> Gatiss says that there had been an argument for producing these tales over three years, but Moffat explained that they rejected "deferred pleasure".<ref name="guard171211"/> The relationship between Holmes and Watson developed during the second series, with Watson being less amazed by Sherlock's deductive abilities; Watson acted as the primary detective in the second episode, "[[The Hounds of Baskerville]]".<ref name="guard171211"/> The cast and production team were more confident during the production of the second series following the positive audience and critical reaction to the first series.<ref name="ds-moff-trf"/><ref name="uncovered">"Sherlock Uncovered", documentary on ''Sherlock'' series 2 DVD/Blu-ray release</ref>

===Music===
The theme and incidental music was composed by [[David Arnold]] and [[Michael Price (composer)|Michael Price]].<ref name="unlocking"/> They, Arnold explains, worked with the producers to "come up with a central theme and character" for the series, then found what was "going to be the defining sound of this show."<ref name="unlocking"/> Pieces were often constructed using [[synthesizer]]s, but the tracks used for the show were recorded using real musicians, Arnold says, to bring the music "to life".<ref name="unlocking"/> Similarly, Price comments that the musicians can adapt their performance of a [[film score|score]] by responding to footage from the show.<ref name="unlocking"/>

"[[A Scandal in Belgravia]]", written by Steven Moffat and directed by Paul McGuigan, was first broadcast on 1 January 2012.

Mark Gatiss wrote "[[The Hounds of Baskerville]]", which investigates the strange activities at a military base.

The second series concluded with "[[The Reichenbach Fall]]". Steve Thompson wrote the episode, which was directed by [[Toby Haynes]], who had previously directed many of Moffat's ''Doctor Who'' episodes. First broadcast on 15 January 2012, the episode follows Moriarty's plot to discredit and kill Sherlock Holmes, concluding with Holmes faking his suicide as Watson looked on.<ref name="missed-clues"/> It was based upon Conan Doyle's story "[[The Final Problem]]", in which Sherlock and Moriarty fall to their deaths from the [[Reichenbach Falls]] in [[Switzerland]].

Moffat and Gatiss have announced three words that allude to the content of the third series. These words were, "rat, wedding, bow".

Conan Doyle fans were generally appreciative.
