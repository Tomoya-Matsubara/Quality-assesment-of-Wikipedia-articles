'''John Cameron''' (October 19, 1834 <U+2013> March 24, 1902) was a Queensland politician, author, and public figure. A pioneering Brisbane auctioneer, realtor, and principal of Cameron Bros, John Cameron is a key early Queensland public figure and one of the builders of Brisbane. 

====Early history====
Born in Launceston, the son of actors and pioneers of the Australian stage, Samson Cameron and Cordelia Bouchier, John was the eldest of nine children. Cameron moved to Victoria, where he married Frances Spencer Hanger in 1860. Together they produced eight children (five boys, three girls) during the 1860s and 1870s.

====Brisbane Real Estate and Cameron Bros====

John Cameron arrived in [[Brisbane]] 8 March 1861, and soon began work as a livestock auctioneer with A Twyman Auctioneering.<ref>[ http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/19711451?searchTerm=cameron%20july%201861&searchLimits=l-title=16] Accessed 29 July 2014</ref>  By the end of July that year, John Cameron had formed an auctioneering partnership with Charles Trundle. This partnership was dissolved in 1864,<ref>[http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/1259215?searchTerm=trundle%20cameron%20july%201861&searchLimits=l-title=16.] Accessed 29 July 2014</ref> and Cameron began the real estate firm that would come to be known as Brisbane icon, Cameron Bros. Cameron introduced into Queensland the concept of subdividing large blocks of land into smaller allotments. He was involved in the creation of Brisbane<U+2019>s first estate, the Waverley Estate in Boggo Road. 

Cameron<U+2019>s association with infamous Brisbane butcher, [[Patrick Mayne]], began early in his career. Both were nominated as aldermen in 1865, with Mayne being elected to office.<ref>[http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/1267999?searchTerm=%22john%20cameron%22%20town%20hall&searchLimits=l-title=16|||sortby=dateAsc] Accessed 29 July 2014</ref>  Later, Mayne<U+2019>s youngest children employed Cameron Bros to manage the heritage-listed Brisbane Arcade on their behalf.<ref>Interview with Margaret Cameron and Stuart Cameron, 17 July 2014</ref>

John Cameron did become an alderman, for the South Brisbane ward, but declined further offers to stand for parliament due to the demands of his business.

====Historic Moreton Bay property====

In 1884, Cameron built the iconic Doobawah on a 10-acre parcel of Ormiston land adjacent to Moreton Bay and Raby Bay, with a view to a retirement spent fishing. Doobawah, the Aboriginal name for Raby Bay, also meant <U+201C>a vast expanse of water<U+201D>.<ref>Redlands Centenary: 100 years of progress 1850 <U+2013> 1950 Souvenir, Truth Process Department and Redlands News, Brisbane, 1950</ref> The property, a former cane plantation, was bounded by Wellington and Eckersley Streets, and fringed by Moreton Bay to the east. Large wings were added to the house, and land to the property, about a year later.<ref>[http://www.redland.qld.gov.au/SiteCollectionDocuments/_About_Redlands/History/Our_Suburbs/ormiston_updated221009.pdf] Accessed 29 July 2014</ref>

====Cameron's published work====

In 1888, John Cameron wrote <U+201C>The Fisherman: a guide to the inexperienced: how when and where to catch fish<U+201D> while living at Doobawah. This was reportedly the first book written in Australia devoted to saltwater fishing.<ref>[http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/doview/nla.aus-f7844-p.pdf] Accessed 29 July 2014</ref>

Cameron also wrote <U+201C>The fire stick: incidents in the shearers' strike: a tale of Australian bush life<U+201D> under the pseudonym Wulla Merrii (published 1893).<ref>Interview with Margaret Cameron and Stuart Cameron, 17 July 2014</ref>  He was a prolific correspondent to local publications in his later years.<ref>Interview with Margaret Cameron and Stuart Cameron, 17 July 2014</ref>

====Later years====

John Cameron died on 24 March 1902 at Doobawah, and is buried in the Toowong cemetery. The Doobawah homestead was broken up and his sons moved the two wings. One wing went to the Holyrood Hospital on Gregory Terrace (later the Country Women<U+2019>s Hostel) and the other became part of St John<U+2019>s College in Kangaroo Point.<ref>Redlands Centenary: 100 years of progress 1850 <U+2013> 1950 Souvenir, Truth Process Department and Redlands News, Brisbane, 1950</ref> Doobawah was subsequently sold to the Pike brothers, who used the property site as a poultry farm.  In 1993, the remaining section of Doobawah was moved 200 metres from its original position in Eckersley St. It is now surrounded by the Empire Point residential estate.<ref>[http://www.redland.qld.gov.au/SiteCollectionDocuments/_About_Redlands/History/Our_Suburbs/ormiston_updated221009.pdf] Accessed 29 July 2014</ref>
Cameron<U+2019>s legacy to the development of Southeast Queensland can be found in the pages of the Cameron Bros journals: a large proportion of Brisbane<U+2019>s property has passed through the family<U+2019>s hands since 1864. Perusal of the Cameron Bros ledgers, now held at the University of Queensland<U+2019>s Fryer Library, reveals a realtor<U+2019>s history of a growing state.<ref>[https://www.library.uq.edu.au/fryer/bulletin/BulletinJune2009.pdf, https://www.library.uq.edu.au/fryer/ms/uqfl450.pdf] Accessed 29 July 2014</ref>
