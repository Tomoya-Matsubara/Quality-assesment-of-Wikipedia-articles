==Description==
Because traditional Japanese garb lacked pockets, objects were often carried by hanging them from the [[obi (sash)|obi]], or sash, in containers known as ''sagemono'' (a Japanese generic term for a hanging object attached to a sash).  Most sagemono were created for specialized contents, such as tobacco, pipes, writing brush and ink, but the type known as inr<U+014D> was suitable for carrying anything small.

Consisting of a stack of tiny, nested boxes, ''inr<U+014D>'' were most commonly used to carry [[Hanko (stamp)|identity seals]] and medicine. The stack of boxes is held together by a cord that is laced through cord runners down one side, under the bottom, and up the opposite side. The ends of the cord are secured to a [[netsuke]], a kind of toggle that is passed between the sash and pants and then hooked over the top of the sash to suspend the inr<U+014D>. An [[ojime]], or bead, is provided on the cords between the inr<U+014D> and netsuke to hold the boxes together. This bead is slid down the two suspension cords to the top of the inr<U+014D> to hold the stack together while the inr<U+014D> is worn, and slid up to the netsuke when the boxes need to be unstacked to access their contents. Inr<U+014D> were made of a variety of materials, including wood, ivory, bone, and lacquer.  Lacquer was also used to decorate inro made of other materials.

Inr<U+014D>, like the [[ojime]] and [[netsuke]] they were associated with, evolved over time from strictly utilitarian articles into objects of high art and immense craftsmanship.
