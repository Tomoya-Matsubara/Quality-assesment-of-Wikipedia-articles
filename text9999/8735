'''Leo Phokas''' ({{lang-el|{{Polytonic|<U+039B><U+03AD><U+03C9><U+03BD> <U+03A6><U+03C9><U+03BA><U+1FB6><U+03C2>}}}}) was an early 10th-century [[Byzantine]] general of the noble [[Phokas]] clan. He was defeated in his campaigns against the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]], and was unsuccessful in his struggle for the throne with [[Romanos Lekapenos]]. After Lekapenos seized control of the Empire, Leo led an unsuccessful revolt, and was captured and blinded.

== Life ==
Leo was the son of [[Nikephoros Phokas the Elder]], an eminent Byzantine general who had distinguished himself in southern Italy. His brother, [[Bardas Phokas the Elder|Bardas]], was also a senior general, as were Bardas' sons [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephoros]] and [[Leo Phokas the Younger|Leo]]. Nikephoros eventually became emperor in 963<U+2013>969.<ref>Kazhdan (1991), p. 1666</ref><ref>Guilland (1976), pp. I 439<U+2013>440</ref> Little is known about Leo's early life. During the late reign of [[Leo VI the Wise]] (r. 886<U+2013>912) he married the sister of [[Constantine the Paphlagonian]], the emperor's powerful ''[[parakoimomenos]]'', and rose to the post of [[Domestic of the Schools]].<ref>Guilland (1976), pp. I 181, 205, 440</ref> Although personally brave and not without some measure of success against the [[Arabs]] in the East, his ability as a general was rather limited. [[Steven Runciman]] attributed his rise more to his aristocratic origin and his familial connection with the ''parakoimomenos'' Constantine.<ref>Runciman (1929), p. 54</ref>

During the regency of Empress [[Zoe Zaoutzaina|Zoe]] in 913<U+2013>919, he is recorded as being again Domestic of the Schools and holding the dignity of ''[[magistros]]''. In 917, he was placed in charge of a large-scale expedition against the Bulgarians. The plan involved a two-pronged assault, one from the south by the main Byzantine army under Leo Phokas, and one from the north by the [[Pechenegs]], who were to be ferried across the [[Danube]] by the [[Byzantine navy]] under [[Romanos Lekapenos]]. In the event however, the Pechenegs did nor abide by the plan and did not help the Byzantines, who suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the Tsar [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Symeon]] at the [[Battle of Acheloos]]. The imperial army was almost annihilated, and Phokas himself barely escaped. As Symeon marched south towards [[Constantinople]], he gathered a motley force and attempted to halt his advance, but was again defeated by Symeon in a surprise night attack at [[Battle of Katasyrtai|Katasyrtai]].<ref>Runciman (1929), pp. 54<U+2013>56</ref><ref>Treadgold (1997), pp. 474<U+2013>475</ref><ref>Guilland (1976), p. I 440</ref> 

These military disasters weakened the regency of Zoe, and rumours began to circulate that Phokas, whose army lay encamped across the [[Bosporus]], and his brother-in-law Constantine the Paphlagonian were planning to seize the throne from the young [[Constantine VII]] (r. 913<U+2013>959). According to Runciman, Zoe herself may have planned planned to marry the general and solidify her own position. The emperor's tutor however, a certain Theodore, turned to Romanos Lekapenos; although he carried a great share of the blame for the failure of the Bulgarian campaign, Romanos' fleet was intact and at hand.<ref>Runciman (1929), pp. 57<U+2013>58</ref><ref name="Treadgold475">Treadgold (1997), p. 475</ref> The ''parakoimomenos'' Constantine tried to neutralize this threat by disbanding the fleet, but he was arrested by Lekapenos when he arrived to supervise the payment of the crews. With this strike, Zoe lost all control of the situation. At Theodore's urging, the young emperor appointed the Patriarch [[Nicholas Mystikos]] as regent. The Patriarch's first act was to dismiss Leo Phokas from his post as Domestic and replace him with [[John Garidas]].<ref name="Treadgold475"/><ref>Runciman (1929), pp. 58<U+2013>59</ref><ref name="Guilland441">Guilland (1976), p.

After overcoming the rebellion of Leo Phokas, Lekapenos promoted himself to ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' and was eventually crowned as senior emperor in December 920]]
Leo tried to secure his position by forcing the Patriarch to appoint some of his relatives to command the ''[[Hetaireia]]'', the imperial bodyguard. The patriarch at first agreed, but almost immediately dismissed them. At this point Leo turned to Lekapenos, and offered a marriage alliance. Lekapenos agreed and swore alliance with him, but on 25 March 919 he managed to gain entrance to the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|imperial palace]], occupying it and securing his appointment as ''magistros'' and commander of the ''Hetaireia'', while a few weeks after, he married his daughter [[Helena Lekapene|Helena]] to the young emperor and assumed the title of ''[[basileopator]]''.<ref name="Treadgold475"/><ref>Runciman (1929), pp. 59<U+2013>60</ref>

Leo Phokas was sent a letter, in the emperor's name, in which he was bidden not to react to these events. Inevitably, the outmaneuvered Leo rose in revolt, but failed to secure the loyalty of his troops: they began to desert to the imperial camp, especially after a letter from the young Constantine VII, which acclaimed Lekapenos as his protector and denounced Leo's rebellion, reached the rebel camp. Eventually, Leo was forced to flee, but was captured and [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]] by the emperor's agents in [[Bithynia]]. Following the discovery of a plot by some of his friends a few months later, Phokas suffered a final humiliation, being paraded through the streets of Constantinople on a mule. His fate thereafter is unknown.<ref name="Guilland441"/><ref>Runciman (1929), pp. 60<U+2013>61</ref><ref>Treadgold (1997), p. 476</ref>
