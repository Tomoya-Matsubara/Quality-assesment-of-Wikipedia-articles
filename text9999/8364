'''Daniel Coffee Trewhitt''' (January 29, 1823 &ndash; January 4, 1891) was an American attorney, judge, and politician.  He served one term (1859&ndash;1861) in the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]], where he was one of the few state legislators to oppose secession on the eve of the Civil War.  He represented [[Hamilton County, Tennessee|Hamilton County]] at the pro-Union [[East Tennessee Convention]], and afterward fought for the Union Army.  He served as judge of the state's second chancery division from 1864 to 1870, and judge of the state's fourth circuit court from 1878 to 1891.  

==Early life==

Trewhitt was born along Daddys Creek in what was then [[Morgan County, Tennessee]], but is now part of [[Cumberland County, Tennessee|Cumberland County]].  He was one of seventeen children of Levi Trewhitt, a county clerk and attorney, and Harriet (Lavender) Trewhitt.  In 1836, he moved with his family to [[Cleveland, Tennessee]], where he attended the Oak Grove Academy from 1837 to 1840.  He afterward read law under his father, and was licensed to practice in 1847.<ref name=speer>William S. Speer, "Hon. D.C. Trewhitt," ''Sketches of Prominent Tennesseans'' (1884), pp. 505-507.</ref>

After receiving his law license, Trewhitt commenced practice in Harrison, Tennessee, which at the time was the county seat of [[Hamilton County, Tennessee|Hamilton County]].<ref name=speer />  In 1854, he ran for district attorney general, but was defeated by rising politician [[George W. Bridges]].<ref>''[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024443/1854-03-24/ed-1/seq-2/#date1=1836&sort=date&date2=1892&words=C+Trewhitt&searchType=basic&sequence=0&index=1&state=Tennessee&rows=20&proxtext=%22c.+trewhitt%22&y=16&x=11&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1 Athens (TN) Post]'', 24 March 1854, p. 2.</ref><ref>"[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85038518/1854-06-11/ed-1/seq-2/#date1=1836&sort=date&date2=1892&words=C+Trewhitt&searchType=basic&sequence=0&index=3&state=Tennessee&rows=20&proxtext=%22c.+trewhitt%22&y=16&x=11&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1 Election Returns]," ''Nashville Union and American'', 11 June 1854, p. 2.</ref>  He ran unsuccessfully for the [[Tennessee Senate]] in 1857, losing to J.C.

Though Southern Democrats had gained control of the state government, Trewhitt joined [[William H. Wisener]], [[Roderick R. Butler]], and [[Dewitt Clinton Senter]] in providing persistent opposition to secession in the state legislature during the months leading up the Civil War.<ref name=speer /> 

==Civil War==

Throughout the first half of 1861, Trewhitt canvassed the Hamilton County area, speaking out against secession.<ref name=notable>[[Oliver Perry Temple]], [[Mary Boyce Temple]] (ed.), "Daniel C. Trewhitt," ''Notable Men of Tennessee'' (Cosmopolitan Press, 1912), pp. 206-207.</ref> He was a delegate to both the [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] and [[Greeneville, Tennessee|Greeneville]] sessions of the [[East Tennessee Convention]], and represented Hamilton County on the convention's powerful business committee.<ref>[[Thomas William Humes]], ''The Loyal Mountaineers of Tennessee'' (Overmountain Press, 1998; originally published in 1888), p. 109.</ref>  The convention sought to create a new state in East Tennessee that would remain in the Union.  Trewhitt was elected to Hamilton County's seat in the Tennessee Senate in August 1861, but the state having seceded, he instead fled to Kentucky to join the Union Army.<ref name=speer /> 

During the Confederate crackdown following the [[East Tennessee bridge burnings]] in late 1861, Trewhitt's father, Levi, was arrested and jailed on suspicion of aiding the bridge-burners.<ref>[[Oliver Perry Temple]], ''East Tennessee and the Civil War'' (Overmountain Press, 1995; originally published in 1899), p. 406-407.</ref>  Despite pleas for his release, he died in a Confederate prison in [[Mobile, Alabama]], in 1862.  His death sparked considerable outrage among East Tennessee's Unionists.<ref name=notable />

Having joined the [[2nd Regiment Tennessee Volunteer Infantry|2nd Tennessee Volunteer Infantry]] with the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]], Trewhitt took part in operations in the [[Cumberland Gap]] area in early 1862, and commanded the 2nd Tennessee at the [[Battle of Mill Springs]] on January 19 of that year.<ref name=speer />  While stationed at [[Barbourville, Kentucky]], however, he fell ill, and resigned his commission.  In April 1862, having recovered, he joined the staff of General [[James G. Spears]] of the 3rd brigade with the rank of captain, and was appointed the brigade's Assistant Adjuntant General.  He was with the brigade at the [[Battle of Stones River]] in early 1863, and at the [[Battle of Chickamauga]] later that year (though his unit arrived after the battle had mostly ended).<ref name=speer />

==Postwar activities and judgeship==

When the East Tennessee Convention reconvened in April 1864, Trewhitt joined Governor [[Andrew Johnson]] and Johnson's eventual successor, [[William Gannaway Brownlow|William G. Brownlow]], in endorsing President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the [[Emancipation Proclamation]].  He afterward supported the agenda of Brownlow and the [[Radical Republicans]], including a contentious piece of legislation known as the "franchise bill," which barred ex-Confederates from voting.<ref name=notable /><ref>"[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045629/1866-08-29/ed-1/seq-2/#date1=1836&sort=date&rows=20&words=C+Trewhitt&searchType=basic&sequence=0&index=11&state=Tennessee&date2=1892&proxtext=%22c.+trewhitt%22&y=16&x=11&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=2 Proceedings of a Union Mass Convention, Assembled at the Court House in Harrison, Hamilton Co., Tenn., Aug. 20, 1866]," ''Knoxville Whig'', 29 August 1866, p. 2.</ref>  In May 1866, Trewhitt and dozens of other East Tennessee Unionists, frustrated over the state legislature's inability to pass a more restrictive franchise bill, held a convention in Knoxville that once again called for East Tennessee to break away and form a separate state.<ref>"[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045629/1866-05-09/ed-1/seq-2/#date1=1836&sort=date&rows=20&words=C+Trewhitt&searchType=basic&sequence=0&index=8&state=Tennessee&date2=1892&proxtext=%22c.+trewhitt%22&y=16&x=11&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=2 Proceedings of the East Tennessee Convention]," ''Knoxville Whig'', 9 May 1866, p. 2.</ref>

In 1864, Johnson appointed Trewhitt chancellor (judge) of the state's second chancery district, which included Chattanooga and surrounding areas of southeastern Tennessee. He held this position until 1870, when the new state constitution restored the voting rights of former Confederates, and he was defeated in his bid for reelection by [[David M. Key]].<ref name=notable />  He then returned to private practice in Chattanooga.<ref name=speer />

In 1878, Trewhitt ran for the state's 4th circuit judgeship.  On election day, he won easily, capturing 1,222 votes out of 2,017 votes (60%) in a three-way race.<ref>"[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86053402/1878-08-08/ed-1/seq-3/#date1=1836&sort=date&rows=20&words=C+Trewhitt&searchType=basic&sequence=0&index=15&state=Tennessee&date2=1892&proxtext=%22c.+trewhitt%22&y=16&x=11&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=3 Vote of Bradley County]," ''Cleveland (TN) Weekly Herald'', 8 August 1878, p. 3.</ref>  During this period, Trewhitt staunchly supported prohibition, going so far as to state, <U+00EC>the greatest battle of the age is now being fought, headed on the one side by Satan in the form of intoxicating liquor, on the other hand by Christianity, morality, sobriety, and decency.<U+00EE><ref>Tim Ezzell, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-9BDAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA109&dq=%22daniel+c.+trewhitt%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QuHTVLGaEIHkgwS9qYNQ&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&q=%22daniel%20c.%20trewhitt%22&f=false Chattanooga, 1865-1900: A City Set Down in Dixie]'' (University of Tennessee Press, 2013), p. 109.</ref>  He was the Republican nominee for the 3rd district seat in Congress in 1882, but was defeated by the Democratic incumbent, [[George Dibrell]].<ref>"[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85033437/1882-09-20/ed-1/seq-2/#date1=1836&sort=date&rows=20&words=C+TREWHITT+Trewhitt&searchType=basic&sequence=0&index=7&state=Tennessee&date2=1892&proxtext=%22c.+trewhitt%22&y=16&x=11&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=5 The Opening Gun]," ''Knoxville Chronicle'', 20 September 1882, p. 2.</ref><ref>"[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85033437/1882-11-11/ed-1/seq-4/#date1=1882&sort=date&rows=20&words=Trewhitt&searchType=basic&sequence=0&index=7&state=Tennessee&date2=1882&proxtext=trewhitt&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=3 Congressional Returns]," ''Knoxville Chronicle'', 11 November 1882, p. 4.</ref> He was, however, reelected to a second term on the 4th circuit court in 1886.<ref name=notable />  

In 1890, Trewhitt began experiencing symptoms of what was later described as "softening of the brain." He died at his home in Chattanooga on January 4, 1891.<ref>"[https://newspapers.library.in.gov/cgi-bin/indiana?a=d&d=IJ18910106.1.1&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN------# Other Deaths]," ''Indianapolis Journal'', 6 January 1891, p. 1.</ref>  He is buried in Chattanooga's Forest Hills Cemetery.<ref name=findagrave />

==Family==

Trewhitt married Mary Melissa Winnee in [[Gwinnett County, Georgia]], in 1841.  They had four children: Thomas, Mary Jane, William, and Martha (William and Martha died in childhood).  After his first wife died in 1861, he married Mary Melissa Hunter on July 4, 1865.  They also had four children: Addison, Alonzo, Paul, and Ellen.<ref name=speer />
