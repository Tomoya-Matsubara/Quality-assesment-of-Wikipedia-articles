'''Latmus''' ([[Ancient Greek]] '''<U+039B><U+03AC><U+03C4><U+03BC><U+03BF><U+03C2>''', Latmos; [[Turkish language|Turkish]] '''Be<U+015F>parmak Da<U+011F><U+0131>''') is a ridge of many spurs running in an east-west direction along the north shore of the former '''Latmian Gulf''' on the coast of [[Caria]], which became part of Hellenised [[Ionia]]. The city of Latmus, located on the south slopes of Mount Latmus {{convert|25|km|mi}} east of [[Miletus]],<ref>Turkish Milet, not to be confused with Turkish [[Milas]].</ref> was originally a port on the narrow gulf, as reported by [[Strabo]].<ref name=Strabo14.1.8>{{cite web|author=Strabo|title=Geography 14.1.8|publisher=Tufts University: Perseus Project|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0198&query=book%3D14%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D8|accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref> He also states that Latmus is the same as '''Mount Phthires''' in the [[Catalogue of Trojans]].<ref>''Iliad'' Book II line 868.</ref>

The mouth of the Gulf of Latmus began to fill with sediment from the [[Maeander]] river, which emptied into it, even in classical antiquity. By 300 CE [[Lake Bafa]] had formed behind the estuary marshes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Br<U+00FC>ckner|first=Helmut|contribution=Delta Evolution and Culture - Aspects of Geoarchaeological Research in Miletos and Priene|year=2003|title=Troia and the Troad: Scientific Approaches|editor-last=Wagner|editor-first=G<U+00FC>nther A.|editor2-last=Pernicka|editor2-first=Ernst|editor3-last=Uerpmann|editor3-first=Peter|pages=122<U+2013>125|publisher=Springer|id=ISBN 3540437118}}</ref> It gradually diminished in salinity and would now be fresh water except that canals to the Aegean introduce a saline element. The ecology remains a brackish-water one and the lake has been made a bird sanctuary. Its area of {{convert|7|km2|mi2}} with a maximum depth of {{convert|25|m|ft}} still extends from the base of the west spur of Mount Latmus, although, having lost its port, the ancient medium-sized town of '''Herakleia''' (Latmus) has declined in size and facilities to the small village of '''Kapikiri'''.

Be<U+015F>parmak looms far beyond Kapikiri to the east for a total distance of about {{convert|35|km|mi}}, {{convert|5|km|mi}} to {{convert|10|km|mi}} wide. It is deeply eroded by various streams into spurs. The spur that can be seen from Kapikiri is one Da<U+011F>, or "mountain", but the entire ridge with all the spurs is Da<U+011F>lar, "mountains", in the sense of "range." The ancient writers generally recognized the western spur over the gulf as Latmus, but Strabo reports that the ridge east was called '''Mount Grium''' and extended through [[Caria]].<ref name=Strabo14.1.8/>

==Geology==
[[Image:Aegean Sea and Anatolian Plates map-fr.png|thumb|left|300px|The Arabian plate at 15 converges into the Anatolian Plate at 21 against the purple line (East Anatolian Fault). The Anatolian Plate moves west slipping along the North Anatolian Fault (green) but there is some north-south extension along the red border, which continues into the Aegean Plate at 37. It is opening the old subduction zone and uncovering the massifs, which have arisen as the [[Cyclades]] and the Menderes Massif.]]
The [[Morphotectonics|morphotectonic]] configuration of [[Anatolia]] and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] is a result of [[Plate tectonics|continental drift movements]] associated with the [[Alpine orogeny]], a zone of mountain-building caused by the collision of the [[African Plate|African]] and [[Arabian Plate]]s with the [[Eurasian Plate]]. The former have been slipping under the latter compressing and lifting the edge and creating zones of [[metamorphic rock]] from previous layers of [[sedimentary rock]]. These zones in the Aegean are represented by a number of [[massif]]s that were originally buried by crustal [[subduction]]: the [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope]], Kazdag, Menderes, Cycladic and Crete.

For various geologic reasons, modelled differently by different geologists, the zone of compression in the Aegean became one of [[Rift|extension]]: the region widened and dome-like or ovoid massifs were uncovered, or exhumed, from the subduction zones and rose by [[isostasy]]. In the case of the Menderes Massif, which is {{convert|40000|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}}, the reasons are better known due to geologic research in central Turkey. Anatolia is a triangular block created by the intersection in central Turkey of the North and East Anatolian faults. As the northward-pressing Arabian Plate pushes against this wedge the latter slips to the west but the broad end opens along fault lines like the rays of a fan, extending the massif to the north-northeast and south. This is being called a bivergent (diverges in two places) model.

The entire massif is divided or nearly so by a [[karst topography]] into three sections: the Gordes Massif north of the Alasehir or [[Gediz river|Gediz]] [[graben]], the Cine Massif south of the [[B<U+00FC>y<U+00FC>k Menderes]] graben and the Central Massif between. The latter is split like a forked tongue by the [[K<U+00FC><U+00E7><U+00FC>k Menderes]] Graben into the Kuzey Detachment to the north and the Guney Detachment to the south. [[Mycale]] is part of the Guney Detachment, while Latmus is in the Cine Massif.

The Graben are low-key [[rift valley]]s. There have been some small intrusions of [[magma]] into the graben appearing now as granito-diorite outcrops. Dates on thin sections of [[monazite]] obtained from the earliest exhumed rocks of the graben suggest  "... that the Cenozoic extension in the Gordes Massif, and possibly the entire Menderes Massif, might have begun in the [[Late Oligocene]]."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Catlos|first=E.J.|coauthors=Ibrahim <U+00C7>emen|title=Monazite ages and the evolution of the Menderes Massif, western Turkey|journal=International Journal of Earth Science|volume=94|pages=page 204|publisher=UCLA SIMS|date=2005|url=http://sims.ess.ucla.edu/PDF/Catlos_Cemen_IJES_2005.pdf|accessdate=2008-02-25|doi=10.1007/s00531-005-0470-7 }}</ref> Despite the rare intrusions, the massif is not of volcanic origin. Most of the visible layer is light, metamorphic rock of various kinds, especially [[marble]] and [[schist]]s.

Except for [[alluvial fan]]s of impermeable [[clay]] the rock is highly porous due to a network of small faults, which dips into the warmer regions below the surface. Warm springs and vapors are common, giving the appearance of volcanic activity. The ancients cross-culturally viewed these phenomena as being caused by divinities, which rock-paintings indicate they worshipped. The north slopes of Latmus are subject to heavy and damaging mudslides, which also would have contributed to the idea that it was a god.

==Mythology==
Latmus appears in [[Greek mythology]] as the site of the cave where [[Selene]]'s consort [[Endymion]] lies forever young and beautiful in blissful sleep.

==Prehistory==
Beginning in 1994 about 170 rock paintings have been discovered in shallow caves and overhangs near springs at the foot of Mount Latmus overlooking Lake Bafa.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Author not stated|title=Unique rock paintings reveal traces of prehistoric human settlement in Anatolia|newspaper=Turkish Daily News|date=Thursday, January 18, 2007|url=http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=64157|format={{dead link|date=May 2009}}}}</ref> They came to light in a survey conducted by Anneliese Peschlow of the German Archaeology Institute.<ref>[http://www.dainst.org/index.php?id=645&sessionLanguage=en Deutsches Arch<U+00E4>ologisches Institut.]</ref> Peschlow dates the earliest to about 6000 BCE and believes from other findings that the region has been continuously occupied since then. She is currently working to get Mount Latmus reserved as a national park.

The paintings, which are done entirely in red, depict mainly social and religious scenes. Different representations of the mountain include a dragon, indicating that it was worshipped as a god; that is, Latmus was a sacred mountain at least as early as the [[Early Bronze Age]].

A 2004 [[Palynology|palynological study]] of two sediment [[Core sample|cores]] taken from [[Lake Bafa]] near Kapikiri (Baf S1) and from the western depth (Baf S6) suggests a habitation sequence of the [[B<U+00FC>y<U+00FC>k Menderes River]] valley and the shores of Latmus that appears to support the early history of the region. Baf S1, containing the oldest sediment, is layered in four subsections, the first [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon dated]] to before 4000 BCE.

From the pollen of subsection 1 a model can be constructed<ref>{{Cite web|last=M<U+00FC>llenhoff|first=Marc|last2=Handl|first2=Mathias|last3=Knipping|first3=Maria|last4=Br<U+00FC>ckner|first4=Halmut|year=2004 |contribution=The evolution of Lake Bafa (Western Turkey) - Sedimentological, microfaunal and palynological results|title=Geographie der Meere und Kusten: Coastline Reports 1|editor-last=Schernewski|editor-first=G.|editor2-last=Dolch|editor2-first=T.|pages=55<U+2013>66|place=Rostock|publisher=EUCC|id=ISSN 0928-2734|url=http://databases.eucc-d.de/files/documents/00000342_AMK2004_Artikel_Muellenhoff.pdf }}</ref> of a lightly-grazed [[Climax community|climax forest]] of [[deciduous]] oak and pine: 27.6% [[Quercus pubescens]], 14.6% [[Pinus]] and lesser concentrations of [[Isoetes histrix]]. Low levels of the pasture weed, [[Plantago lanceolata]], indicate a low level of grazing by animals belonging to [[Indigenous peoples|indigenes]] that lived somewhere else. There is no evidence that they settled or grew crops in the region.

Subsection 2, dated 1240/1126 BCE to 710/558 BCE, represents a settlement from the [[Bey<U+015F>ehir]] Occupation Phase of southern Anatolia, dated there 3500/3000 BP to 1500 BP.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Behre|first=Karl-Ernst|contribution=Some reflections on the anthropogenic indicators and the record of prehistoric occupation phases in pollen diagrams from the Near East|year=1990|title=Man's Role in the Shaping of the Eastern Mediterranean Landscape|editor-last=Bottema|editor-first=S.|editor2-last=Entjes-Nieborg|editor2-first=G.|editor3-last=Van Zeist|editor3-first=W.|pages=219 following|place=Rotterdam, Brookfield|publisher=A.A. Balkema|id=ISBN 9061911389}}</ref> It has a specific palynological profile of "secondary anthropogenic indicators;" that is, not pollen of cultivated plants but of other species growing on cultivated land: certain percentages of [[Plantago lanceolata]], [[Sanguisorba minor]], [[Pistacia]], [[Platanus]], [[Quercus calliprinos]] and [[Juniperus]].

The Lake Bafu profile shows the replacement of deciduous oak and pine with [[maquis]] species: [[Phillyrea]], [[Cistus]], [[Ericaceae]]; fruit trees: [[Olea]], [[Castanea]]; and farm weeds: Plantago lanceolata and Juniperus. Carbon in the sediment suggests the forest was cleared by [[slash and burn]]. This period corresponds to the settlement of the [[Carians]] in the area, who apparently moved in from southern Anatolia. There is a semi-legendary tradition that they subdued another Pre-Hellenic people, the [[Leleges]], but the evidence is not precise enough to say if the indigenes were all or partly Leleges. As the Carians worshipped [[Endymion]], he may have been brought in at this time.

Subsection 3 reveals an abandonment of the cleared areas, the decline of [[Olea]], and the spread of [[Pistacia]], [[Pinus brutia]] and [[Quercus coccifera]] (instead of deciduous oak) on formerly cleared land and in the maquis. As this is the time of the rise of [[Ionia]], the palynological scenario suggests a movement of population from the land to the newly settled or expanded big cities of the [[Ionian League]]. Subsection 4 and Baf S6 go on to catalogue the return of the fruit trees, re-clearing the land for pasture, planting of rye and other cereals, ultimate destabilization of the soil through over-use, denudation and acceleration of sedimentation. After the sealing off of the bay to form the lake, population and land use declined to their current low levels around Latmus, but the river valley is cultivated.

==History==
[[File:Miletus Bay silting evolution map-en.svg|thumb|right|250px|Location of Mount Latmus South of [[B<U+00FC>y<U+00FC>k Menderes River|Maeander River]]'s mouth.]]
With the expansion of Greek culture, Latmus became a member of the [[Delian League]] in the fifth century BCE. In the fourth century the Persian satrap (a Carian) [[Mausolus of Halicarnassus]] captured the city by a ruse<ref>[[Polyainos]] 7.23.2 reports the capture of Latmos by Mausolos, and 8.53.4 by Artemisia as sole ruler.</ref> and fortified it with a circuit wall;<ref>The wall, originally with sixty-five towers (''Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites'' 1976), is one of the best-preserved urban fortifications of Antiquity.</ref> under Hellenising influence the city was refounded a kilometer to the west<ref>The old city site became a [[necropolis]].</ref> on a rectilinear grid system<ref>The rectilinear grid of streets typical of Hellenistic foundations is traditionally credited to Alexander's architect [[Hippodamus of Miletus]].</ref> as Heracleia under Latmos,<ref>Whether or not '''Alexandria by Latmus''' was identical to this Heracleia is still an open question, according to Getzel M. Cohen, ''The Hellenistic Settlements in Europe, the Islands, and Asia Minor.'' (Hellenistic Culture and Society, '''17''')     (Berkeley:  University of California Press) 1995: 245f; the city was called s also called Pleistarcheia for a while (pp. 261-263).</ref> dedicated to the hero [[Heracles]].<ref>''Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites'' 1976; see also P.M. Fraser, ''Cities of Alexander the Great'' (Oxford 1996:28-29) and A.W. McNicoll, ''Hellenistic Fortifications from the Aegean to the Euphrates'' (Oxford 1997:75-81). </ref> The modern village of '''Kap<U+0131>k<U+0131>r<U+0131>''' is built among the ruins.

The ''[[temenos]]'', or sanctuary of Endymion, with pre-Greek origins, was rebuilt in [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic times]], and may still be seen on a rise to the south of the ancient city.<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] remarked "The [[Elis|Eleians]] and the Herakleians near Miletos tell different stories about Endymion's death; the Eleians show you Endymion's tomb but the Herakleians say he went away to Mount Latmos, where they honour him and have a holy place of Endymion." (v.1.5).</ref> The building faces the southwest; it has a [[cella]] with a horseshoe-shaped rear wall partly cut out of the bedrock, with an entrance hall and columned forecourt. 

A temple of Athena at Heracleia reveals its earlier foundation by not being aligned with the Hellenistic street pattern.

In the seventh century CE the many caves in this [[karst]]ic terrain attracted communities of Christian monks supported by the plentiful fish in Lake Bafa. Endymion was [[Christianization|Christianised]] as a mystic saint, whose coffin was opened annually and whose bones emitted musical tones<ref>Peter Levi, ed. ''Pausanias, Guide to Greece'' 1979:198 note 7.</ref> and the site drew pilgrims. In the ninth century, [[Joseph the Hymnographer]] was tonsured in the monastery of Latmus.
