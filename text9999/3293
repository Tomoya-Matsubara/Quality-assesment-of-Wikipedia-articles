'''William Felton "Bill" Russell''' (born [[February 12]], [[1934]]) is a retired [[United States|American]] professional [[basketball]] player who played [[center (basketball)|center]] for the [[Boston Celtics]] of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. A five-time winner of the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]] and a twelve-time [[All-Star]], the 6'9" Russell was the centerpiece of the Celtics [[dynasty (sports)|dynasty]] that won eleven league championships during Russell's thirteen-year career. Along with [[Henri Richard]] of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Montreal Canadiens]], Russell holds the record for the most championships won by an athlete in a North American sports league.  Before his professional career, Russell led the [[University of San Francisco]] to two consecutive [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|National Collegiate Athletic Association championships]] (1955, 1956).  He also won a [[gold medal]] at the [[Basketball at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Olympics]] as captain of the [[United States men's national basketball team|U.S. national basketball team]]. 

Russell is widely considered one of the best [[defense (sport)|defensive]] players in NBA history.  His [[block (basketball)|shot-blocking]] and [[man-to-man defense|man-to-man]] coverage were major reasons for the Celtics' success, and he inspired other players to elevate their own defensive play.  Russell was equally notable for his [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]] abilities.  He led the NBA in rebounds four times and tallied 21,620 total rebounds in his career.  He is one of just two NBA players (the other being prominent rival [[Wilt Chamberlain]]) to have grabbed over fifty rebounds in a single game.  Though never the focal point of the Celtics' [[offense (sports)|offense]], Russell also scored 14,522 career points and provided effective passing and [[screen (sports)|pick]]-setting skills.  

Playing in the wake of pioneers like [[Earl Lloyd]], [[Chuck Cooper]], and [[Ray Felix]], Russell was the first [[African American]] player to achieve superstar status in the NBA.  He also served a three-year (1966-69) stint as [[player-coach]] for the Celtics, thus becoming the first African American coach in the NBA.  However, Russell frequently battled with [[racism]], even while in Boston.  Many sports fans in Boston shunned the Celtics during Russell's tenure with the team, and Russell received little support from the local press.  When he retired, Russell left Boston with a bitter attitude, although in recent years his relationship with the city has improved.             

Russell is now a member of the [[Basketball Hall of Fame|Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] and the [[National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame]].  He was named one of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History]] in 1996.  He has been married twice and has three children, including lawyer and television pundit [[Karen Russell]].

==Early years==
Bill Russell was born to Charles and Katie Russell in [[Monroe, Louisiana]], where his family often struggled with racism.<ref name="Current">{{cite web | last = Thompson | first = Tim | title = Bill Russell overcame long odds, dominated basketball | url=http://www.thecurrentonline.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&uStory_id=d9770e44-d716-4359-8710-3a2be480029e| accessdate = 2007-02-08 }}</ref> In one particular instance, Russell's father was denied service at a gasoline station until the staff had taken care of all the white customers. When his father attempted to leave and find a different station, the attendant stuck a shotgun in his face, threatening to kill him unless he stayed and waited his turn.<ref name="Current"> </ref> In another instance, Russell's mother was walking down a street in a fancy dress when the local sheriff accosted her.  He told her to go home and remove the dress, which he described as "white woman<U+2019>s clothing".<ref name="Current"> </ref> Due to this racism Russell's father moved the family out of Louisiana when Russell was eight years old and settled them in [[Oakland, California]].<ref name="Current"> </ref> While there the family fell into poverty, and Russell spent his childhood in a series of [[Public housing#Canada and United States|project homes]].<ref name="Current"> </ref>

In his early years, Russell struggled to develop his skills as a basketball player.  In [[junior high school]], he was cut from his team, and as a [[Tenth grade|sophomore]] at [[McClymonds High School]] he had barely made the junior varsity team.<ref name="NNDB">{{cite web | last = nndb.com| first = | title = Bill Russell | url=http://www.nndb.com/people/783/000023714/| accessdate = 2007-02-08 }}</ref> It was not until his [[Eleventh grade|junior]] and [[Twelfth grade|senior]] years that he began to excel as a player.  However, his development as a rising sports star was overshadowed by classmate and eventual baseball Hall of Famer [[Frank Robinson]].<ref name="NNDB"> </ref>

==College career==
[[Image:Russell at USF.jpg|right|thumbnail| Russell scores a basket while at the University of San Francisco in a game versus [[Southern Methodist University|SMU]].]]
The only college to offer Russell a sports scholarship was the local [[University of San Francisco]] (USF), where Russell played under coach [[Phil Woolpert]].<ref name="NNDB"> </ref>  In 1954, Woolpert became the first coach of a major amateur basketball squad to start three [[African-American]] players: Hal Perry, [[K.C. Jones]] and Russell.<ref name="usf">{{cite web | last = Schneider | first = Bernie | title = University of San Francisco: "1953-56 NCAA Championship Seasons: The Bill Russell Years" | url=http://usfdons.cstv.com/trads/russell_years.html
 | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> Unfortunately, Russell and his African American teammates became targets of racist jeers, both at USF and on the road.<ref name="jwr">{{cite web | last = Matthews | first = Chris | title =  Bill Russell and American racism | url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/matthews042800.asp | accessdate = 2007-02-09 }}</ref>  In one notable incident, hotels in [[Oklahoma City]] refused to admit Russell and his black teammates while they were in town for the 1954 All-College Tournament. In protest, the whole team decided to camp out in a closed [[college dorm]], which they later considered an important bonding experience.<ref name="usf">{{cite web | last = Schneider | first = Bernie | title = University of San Francisco: "1953-56 NCAA Championship Seasons: The Bill Russell Years" | url=http://usfdons.cstv.com/trads/russell_years.html
 | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> Decades later, Russell explained that his experiences hardened him against abuse of all kinds. "I never permitted myself to be a victim," he said.<ref>{{cite web

On the hardwood, his experiences were far more pleasant. Russell led USF to [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA championships]] in 1955 and 1956, including an impressive string of 55 consecutive victories. He became famous for his strong defense and his [[block (basketball)|shot-blocking]] skills, once denying 13 shots in a single game. [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] coach [[John Wooden]] called Russell "the greatest defensive man I've ever seen". <ref name="usf">{{cite web | last = Schneider | first = Bernie | title = University of San Francisco: "1953-56 NCAA Championship Seasons: The Bill Russell Years" | url=http://usfdons.cstv.com/trads/russell_years.html

Another rule that emerged in response to Russell (and fellow dominant center [[Wilt Chamberlain]]) was the widening of the [[Basketball_court#Free_throw_lane|lane]].  During the 1956-57 season, the lane was widened from six to twelve feet.<ref> {{cite web | title = Rules of Basketball | url = http://www.howard-winn.k12.ia.us/projects/ind_stdy06/ac/bb_rules/lane.html | accessdate = 2007-02-08  }}</ref> This rule change forced centers to play further from the basket.

Besides basketball, Russell represented USF in [[Athletics (track and field)|track and field]] events.  Russell competed in the 440 yard (402 m) race, which he could complete in 49.6 seconds.<ref>{{cite news

That year, Russell won high jump titles at the Central California [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] meet, the Pacific AAU meet, and the West Coast Relays.  One of his best jumps occurred at the West Coast Relays, where he achieved a mark of 6 feet 9<U+00BC> inches (2.06 m).  <ref> {{cite web |last = CBS Sportsline.com|first = |title =  NCAA Basketball Tourney History | url = http://www.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/mayhem/history/multitalented | accessdate = 2007-02-23}}</ref>  

After his years at USF, the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] invited Russell to join their legendary basketball squad. However, since owner [[Abe Saperstein]] would only discuss the matter with Russell's coach, Russell declined the offer. He reasoned that if Saperstein was too smart to speak with him, then he was too smart to play for Saperstein. Instead, Russell made himself eligible for the [[1956 NBA Draft]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Green |first=Ben |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Spinning The Globe |year=2005 |publisher=Amistad |location= |id=ISBN 0-06-055549-1}}

==1956 NBA Draft==
In the [[1956 NBA Draft]], [[Boston Celtics]] coach [[Red Auerbach]] had set his sights on Russell, thinking his defensive toughness and [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]] prowess was the missing link the Celtics needed. In perspective, Auerbach<U+2019>s thoughts were unorthodox. In that period, [[center (basketball)|centers]] and [[forward (basketball)|forwards]] were defined by their offensive output, and the ability to play defense was secondary.<ref name="nbacompraise">{{cite web | last = Ryan | first = Bob | title = Timeless Excellence, essay @ nba.com | url=http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/players/bill_russell.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> However, the chances of getting Russell seemed slim. Because the Celtics had finished second in the previous season and the worst teams had the highest draft picks, the Celtics had slipped too low in the draft order to pick Russell. In addition, Auerbach had already used his territorial pick to acquire talented forward [[Tom Heinsohn]]. But Auerbach knew that the [[Rochester Royals]], who owned the first draft pick, already had a talented young rebounder in [[Maurice Stokes]] and were unwilling to pay Russell the $25,000 signing bonus he requested.<ref name="nbacomsummary">{{cite web | last = nba.com | first = | title = Bill Russell nba.com summary | url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/russell_bio.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> The [[St. Louis Hawks]], who owned the second pick, originally drafted Russell, but were vying for Celtics center [[Ed Macauley]], a six-time [[All-Star]] who had roots in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. Auerbach agreed to trade Macauley if they gave up Russell, and after the Celtics also agreed to give up rookie [[Cliff Hagan]], the Hawks made the trade. During that same draft, Boston also claimed guard [[K.C. Jones]], Russell's former USF teammate. Thus, in one night, the Celtics managed to draft three future Hall-of-Fame players (and, in time, three NBA championship winning coaches): Russell, K.C. Jones and Heinsohn.<ref name="nbacomsummary">{{cite web | last = nba.com | first = | title = Bill Russell nba.com summary | url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/russell_bio.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref>

==1956 Olympics==
Before his NBA rookie year, Russell was the captain of the [[United States men's national basketball team|U.S. national basketball team]] that competed at the [[Basketball at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Olympic tournament]]. Russell had the option to skip the tournament and play a full season for the Celtics, but he was determined to play in the Olympics.  He later commented that he would have participated in the [[high jump]] if he had been snubbed by the basketball team.<ref name="chat">{{cite web | last = Russell | first = Bill | title = Chat Transcript: Celtics Legend Bill Russell @ celtics.com | url=http://www.nba.com/celtics/chat/russell_050228.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> Under coach Gerald Tucker, Russell helped the national team win the [[gold medal]] in [[Melbourne]], defeating the [[Soviet Union]] 89-55 in the final game. The United States dominated the tournament, winning by an average of 53.5 points per game. Russell led the team in scoring, averaging 14.1 points per game for the competition.  His Celtics teammate K.C. Jones joined him on the Olympic squad and contributed 10.9 points per game.<ref>{{cite web | last = usabasketball.com | first = |title=Games of the XVIth Olympiad&ndash;1956|url=http://www.usabasketball.com/history/moly_1956.html | accessdate=2006-02-23}}</ref>

==Professional career==
===1956-59===
Russell could not join the Celtics for the [[1956-57 NBA season]] until December, due to his Olympic commitment. After rejoining the Celtics, Russell played 48 games, averaging 14.7 points per game and a league-high 19.6 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] per game.<ref name="brstats">{{cite web | last = basketball-reference.com | first = | title = Bill Russell stats |url=http://basketball-reference.com/players/r/russebi01.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> During this season, the Celtics featured five-future Hall of Famers: center Bill Russell, forwards Tom Heinsohn and [[Jim Loscutoff]], [[guard (basketball)|guards]] [[Bill Sharman]] and [[Bob Cousy]], and forward [[Frank Ramsey (basketball) | Frank Ramsey]], who came off the bench.  (K.C. Jones did not play for the Celtics until 1958 because of military service.)<ref>{{cite web | last = hoophall.com | first = | title = K.C. Jones NBA Hall of Fame summary | url=http://www.hoophall.com/halloffamers/JonesKC.htm| accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref>  

In previous years, the Celtics had been a high-scoring team, but lacked the defensive presence needed to close out tight games. However, with the added defensive presence of Russell, the Celtics had laid the foundation for one of the most impressive sports dynasties of all time. The team utilized a strong defensive approach to the game, forcing opposing teams to commit many [[turnover (basketball)|turnovers]] that would ultimately lead to easy fast break points. This approach allowed the Celtics to finish with an impressive 44-28 regular season record, their second-best record since inception in the 1946-47 [[National Basketball Association|BAA]] season, and guaranteed a post-season playoff appearance.<ref>{{cite web

In [[1957 NBA Playoffs|Game 1 of the first round]], the Celtics met the [[Syracuse Nationals]], who were led by future Hall-of-Famer [[Dolph Schayes]].  It was here that Russell completed one of the best games of his career. He finished with 16 [[point (basketball)|points]] and 31 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]], along with a reported 7 [[block (basketball)|blocks]]. (At the time, blocks were not yet an officially registered statistic.)  After the Celtics' convincing victory (108-89), Schayes quipped, <U+201C>How much does that guy make a year? It would be to our advantage if we paid him off for five years to get away from us in the rest of this series.<U+201D><ref name="nbacompraise">{{cite web | last = Ryan | first = Bob | title = Timeless Excellence, essay @ nba.com | url=http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/players/bill_russell.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> The Celtics swept the Nationals in three games and eventually earned an appearance in [[1957 NBA Finals|the NBA Finals]].<ref>{{cite web

In the NBA Finals, the Celtics met the St. Louis Hawks, who were led by superstar forward [[Bob Pettit]] and former Celtic Macauley. The teams split the first six games, leading to a deciding Game 7. It was during this game that Russell completed the famous <U+201C>Coleman Play.<U+201D>  Here, Russell ran down Hawks guard [[Jack Coleman (basketball)|Jack Coleman]], who had received an outlet pass at midcourt, and blocked his shot despite the fact that Russell had been standing at his own baseline when the ball was thrown to Coleman. The block preserved the slim 103-102 lead with 40-odd seconds left to play, saving the game for the Celtics. The game would eventually lead into double overtime, where the Celtics prevailed 125-123, earning their first NBA Championship.<ref name="nbacompraise">{{cite web | last = Ryan | first = Bob | title = Timeless Excellence, essay @ nba.com | url=http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/players/bill_russell.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> 

In the [[1957-58 NBA season]], Russell averaged 16.6 points per game and a league-record average of 22.7 rebounds per game.<ref name="brstats">{{cite web | last = basketball-reference.com | first = | title = Bill Russell stats |url=http://basketball-reference.com/players/r/russebi01.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> An interesting phenomenon began that year: Russell was voted the NBA Most Valuable Player, but, strangely, only named to the All-NBA Second Team.  This would repeatedly occur throughout his career. The NBA reasoned that other centers were better all-round players than Russell, but no player had meant more to his team.

For the second straight year, the Celtics had the NBA's best record, breezed through the Eastern Division finals, and met the Hawks in the [[1958 NBA Finals]]. After splitting the first two games, Russell injured his ankle in Game 3. Powered by a frontcourt of Macauley and Pettit, the Hawks and their coach [[Alex Hannum]] won the NBA title in six games.<ref name="nbacomsummary">{{cite web | last = nba.com | first = | title = Bill Russell nba.com summary | url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/russell_bio.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web

In the following [[1958-59 NBA season]], Russell continued his strong play, averaging 16.7 points per game and 23.0 rebounds per game.  He began one of the most impressive rebounding performances of all time, never failing to average less than 23 rebounds for the next seven years.<ref name="nbacomsummary">{{cite web | last = nba.com | first = | title = Bill Russell nba.com summary | url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/russell_bio.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref><ref name="brstats">{{cite web | last = basketball-reference.com | first = | title = Bill Russell stats |url=http://basketball-reference.com/players/r/russebi01.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> The Celtics broke the league record by winning 52 games, and Russell's strong performance once again helped lead the Celtics through the post-season, and eventually, into the NBA Finals.

===1959-66===

In the [[1959-60 NBA season]], the NBA witnessed the debut of legendary 7'1" [[Philadelphia Warriors]] center [[Wilt Chamberlain]], who still holds numerous individual single-game and full-season records, including record-setting 100-point and 55-rebound-games and an incredible 50.4 ppg regular-season scoring average (1961-62) &ndash; marks which no one has approached since.<ref name="wiltsummary">{{cite web | last = nba.com | first = | title = Wilt Chamberlain nba.com summary | url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/chamberlain_bio.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> The matchup between Russell and Chamberlain, the greatest defensive and the greatest offensive pivots in the NBA, became one of basketball's legendary rivalries.<ref name="hoopshall">{{cite web | last = hoophall.com | first = | title = Bill Russell NBA Hall of Fame summary | url=http://www.hoophall.com/halloffamers/RussellW.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> Russell's Celtics, who won a record 59 regular season games (including a then-record tying [[List_of_National_Basketball_Association_longest_winning_streaks|17 game win streak]]), met Chamberlain's Warriors [[1960 NBA Playoffs|in the Eastern Division Finals]].

The Celtics lost playmaker [[Bob Cousy]] to retirement before the [[1962-63 NBA season]], but they drafted another legendary player, future Hall-of-Famer [[John Havlicek]]. Once again, the Celtics were powered by an inspired Russell, who averaged 16.8 points and 23.6 rebounds per game, won his fourth regular-season MVP title, and earned MVP honors at the 1963 [[National Basketball Association All-Star Game|NBA All-Star Game]] following his 19 point, 24 rebound performance for the East.<ref name="brstats">{{cite web | last = basketball-reference.com | first = | title = Bill Russell stats |url=http://basketball-reference.com/players/r/russebi01.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref>  The Celtics reached the [[1963 NBA Finals]], where they faced the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].

In Russell's second to last season, the [[1967-68 NBA season]], his numbers slowly declined, but at age 34, he still tallied 12.5 points per game and an impressive 18.6 rebounds per game<ref name="brstats">{{cite web | last = basketball-reference.com | first = | title = Bill Russell stats |url=http://basketball-reference.com/players/r/russebi01.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> (the latter good for the third highest average in the league).<ref name="1968 NBA Season">{{cite web | last = basketball-reference.com | first = | title = 1968 NBA Season Summary | url= http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1968.html}}. </ref> [[1967 NBA Playoffs|In the Eastern Division Finals]], the 76ers seemed on the verge of defeating the Celtics once again.

Heading into the playoffs during Russell<U+2019>s last season in [[1968-69 NBA season|1968-69]], the chances seemed slim for another championship. Russell himself put up decent numbers of 9.9 points per game and 19.3 rebounds per game,<ref name="brstats">{{cite web | last = basketball-reference.com | first = | title = Bill Russell stats |url=http://basketball-reference.com/players/r/russebi01.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> but the aging Celtics stumbled through the regular season.

</ref> In the playoffs, however, Russell and his Celtics achieved one upset after another until meeting the Los Angeles Lakers in [[1969 NBA Finals|the NBA Finals]].  Though the Celtics faced a heavily favored Lakers team with future Hall of Famers [[Jerry West]], [[Elgin Baylor]] and newly-acquired Wilt Chamberlain, Russell's team did split the first six games and seemed to have a realistic chance of winning.  In Game 7, they were ahead by nine points with five minutes remaining; in addition, Chamberlain had left the game with an injured leg. The Celtics' fortune changed when the Lakers cut the lead to one and Chamberlain asked to return to the game. Inexplicably, however, Lakers coach [[Bill van Breda Kolff]] benched Chamberlain until the end, much to the disgust of Lakers superstar Jerry West.<ref name="wiltsummary">{{cite web | last = nba.com | first = | title = Wilt Chamberlain nba.com summary | url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/chamberlain_bio.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref>The Celtics won the NBA title, and Russell claimed his eleventh championship in 13 years.

===Post-player career===
Russell had his No. 6 jersey retired by the Celtics in 1972, and he was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 1975. Russell, who had a difficult relationship with the media (for reasons stated below), was not present at either event.<ref name="espn">{{cite web | last = Flatter | first = Ron | title = Russell was a proud, fierce warrior | url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016449.html
 | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> After retiring as a player, Russell had stints as head coach of the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] (1973 to 1977) and [[Sacramento Kings]] (1987 to 1988). His time as a coach was lackluster; although he led the struggling SuperSonics into the playoffs for the first time in franchise history, Russell<U+2019>s defensive, team-oriented Celtics mindset did not mesh well with the team. Ironically, coach [[Lenny Wilkens]] would later use a similar concept to help the SuperSonics [[1979 NBA Finals|win the title in 1979]]. Russell<U+2019>s stint with the Kings was considerably worse, his last assignment ending when the Kings went 17-41. Between coaching stints, Russell worked as a [[color commentator]], but he was never comfortable as a broadcaster.<ref name="nbacomsummary">{{cite web | last = nba.com | first = | title = Bill Russell nba.com summary | url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/russell_bio.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> Russell also wrote books, usually written as a joint project with a professional writer. <!-- One, ''Second Wind'', is rather different from the typical athlete's reminiscences, being a sort of combined autobiography and athletic history of a particularly dramatic time in American history. {{fact}} --> These included 1979's ''Second Wind'' and 2001's ''Russell's Rules''. After spending several years outside the public eye, Russell rose to prominence again in January 2006, when he convinced [[Miami Heat]] superstar center [[Shaquille O'Neal]] to bury the hatchet with fellow NBA superstar and former [[Los Angeles Lakers]] team ate [[Kobe Bryant]], with whom O'Neal had a [[Shaq-Kobe feud|bitter public feud]].<ref>{{cite web

==Awards and feats==
Russell is one of the most successful and decorated athletes in North American sports. His awards and achievements include an amazing eleven NBA championships as a player with Boston Celtics in 13 seasons (1957, 1959-66, 1968-69), among them two NBA championships as player/[[head coach]] with Boston Celtics (1968-1969). His stint as coach of the Celtics was also of historical significance, as he was appointed first black head coach in major U.S. professional sports when he succeeded [[Red Auerbach]].<ref name="hoopshall">{{cite web | last = hoophall.com | first = | title = Bill Russell NBA Hall of Fame summary | url=http://www.hoophall.com/halloffamers/RussellW.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> In addition, he won five NBA Most Valuable Player Awards (1958, 1961-63, 1965), was nominated three times for the [[All-NBA First Team]]s (1959, 1963, 1965) and eight Second Teams (1958, 1960-62, 1964, 1966-68), was elected into one [[NBA All-Defensive Team|NBA All-Defensive First Team]] (1969) and is a twelve-time NBA All-Star (1958-1969). Furthermore, Russell led the NBA in [[rebound]]s per game in first three seasons (19.6, 22.7, 23.0) and five times overall, led the NBA in minutes played (1959, 42.5 mpg) and in 1965 (44.5 mpg), and scored 14,522 points (15.1 ppg) in his career and averaged 16.2 ppg in 165 playoff games.<ref name="hoopshall">{{cite web | last = hoophall.com | first = | title = Bill Russell NBA Hall of Fame summary | url=http://www.hoophall.com/halloffamers/RussellW.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref>

Concerning individual games, Russell also obtained several rebounding records. He holds the NBA record for most rebounds in a half (32) vs. Philadelphia ([[November 16]], [[1957]]) and is the Celtics' all-time leading rebounder (21,620, 22.5 rpg) in 963 games, second best in history behind his perennial rival [[Wilt Chamberlain]]. Russell grabbed a then-record 51 rebounds vs. [[Syracuse Nationals|Syracuse]] ([[February 5]], [[1960]]), making him one of two players ever (Wilt Chamberlain is the other) to grab more than 50 boards in a game. Russell also had seven games with 40 or more rebounds.  Russell also holds the career playoff record for most rebounds (4,104, 24.9 rpg) in 165 games, the NBA Finals record for highest rebound per game average (29.5 rpg, 1959) and by a rookie (22.9 rpg, 1957). In addition, Russell also holds the [[NBA Finals]] single-game record for most free throws attempted in one half (15, [[April 11]], [[1961]]) vs. St. Louis, most rebounds (40, [[March 29]], [[1960]] vs. [[St. Louis Hawks|St. Louis]] and [[April 18]], [[1962]] vs. Los Angeles), most rebounds by a rookie (32, [[April 13]], [[1957]] vs. St. Louis), and most rebounds in a quarter (19, [[April 18]], [[1962]] vs. Los Angeles). <ref name="hoopshall">{{cite web | last = hoophall.com | first = | title = Bill Russell NBA Hall of Fame summary | url=http://www.hoophall.com/halloffamers/RussellW.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref>  

For his achievements, Russell was named "Sportsman of the Year" by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' in 1968, "Greatest Player in the History of the NBA" by the ''Professional Basketball Writers Association of America'' in 1980 and made all three NBA Anniversary Teams, the NBA 25th Anniversary All-Time Team (1970), the NBA 35th Anniversary All-Time Team (1980) and the NBA 50th Anniversary All-Time Team (1996). Finally, his number 6 jersey was retired by the Celtics in 1972.<ref name="hoopshall">{{cite web | last = hoophall.com | first = | title = Bill Russell NBA Hall of Fame summary | url=http://www.hoophall.com/halloffamers/RussellW.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref>

Russell is the NBA's most honored player of all time in terms of leading his teams to championships. He won 11 championships in the 13 years that he played in the NBA, and is credited with having raised defensive play in the NBA to a new level.<ref name="hoopshall">{{cite web | last = hoophall.com | first = | title = Bill Russell NBA Hall of Fame summary | url=http://www.hoophall.com/halloffamers/RussellW.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> Russell was known as one of the most clutch players in the NBA. He played in 11 deciding games (10x a deciding Game 7, once a deciding Game 5), and ended with a flawless 11-0 record. In these eleven games, Russell averaged 18 points and 29.45 rebounds.<ref name="nbacompraise">{{cite web | last = Ryan | first = Bob | title = Timeless Excellence, essay @ nba.com | url=http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/players/bill_russell.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> On the hardwood, he was considered the consummate defensive center, noted for his unmatched defensive intensity, his stellar basketball [[intelligence quotient|IQ]] and his sheer will to win.<ref name="nbacompraise">{{cite web | last = Ryan | first = Bob | title = Timeless Excellence, essay @ nba.com | url=http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/players/bill_russell.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> Russell excelled at playing man-to-man defense, blocking shots, and grabbing defensive and offensive rebounds.<ref name="nbacomsummary"> </ref> He also could score with putbacks and made mid-air outlet passes to point guard [[Bob Cousy]] for easy fast break points.<ref name="nbacomsummary">{{cite web | last = nba.com | first = | title = Bill Russell nba.com summary | url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/russell_bio.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> He was also known as an excellent passer and pick-setter, featuring a decent left-handed hook shot and finishing strong on [[alley oop]]s.<ref name="nbacompraise">{{cite web | last = Ryan | first = Bob | title = Timeless Excellence, essay @ nba.com | url=http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/players/bill_russell.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> However, on offense, Russell's input was limited. His NBA career personal averages describe him as a mediocre scorer (15.1 points career average), a poor [[free throw]] shooter (56.1%), and average overall shooter from the field (44%, not exceptional for a center). In his 13 years, he averaged a relatively low 13.4 field goals attempted (normally, top scorers average 20 and more), illustrating he was never the focal point of the Celtics offense, instead open to focus on his tremendous defense.<ref name="brstats">{{cite web | last = basketball-reference.com | first = | title = Bill Russell stats url=http://basketball-reference.com/players/r/russebi01.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref>

Having won an NCAA Championship his final year with the [[University of San Francisco]] in 1956 and an NBA title with the Celtics in 1957, Russell is only one of four players in basketball history to win an NCAA championship and an NBA Championship back-to-back, the others being [[Henry Bibby]] ([[UCLA]] 1972, [[New York Knicks]] 1973), [[Magic Johnson]] ([[Michigan State University]] 1979, [[Los Angeles Lakers]] 1980) and [[Billy Thompson]] ([[University of Louisville]] 1986, [[Los Angeles Lakers]] 1987). In the interim, Russell collected an Olympic gold medal in 1956. Russell continued with his strong play by establishing an impressive list of individual feats. In his first full season (1957-58), Russell became the first player in NBA history to average more than 20 rebounds per game for an entire season; a feat he accomplished 10 times in his 13 seasons. Career-wise, Russell ranks second only to [[Wilt Chamberlain]] in regular season total (21,620) and average (22.5) rebounds per game.  Russell's 51 rebounds in a single game is the second best performance ever, only trailing Chamberlain's all-time record of 55, and he still holds the NBA record for rebounds in one half with 32. Russell is the all-time playoff leader in total (4,104) and average (24.9) rebounds per game, he grabbed 40 rebounds in three separate playoff games, and he never failed to average at least 20 rebounds per game in any of his 13 post-season campaigns.  In his career, Russell won earned five regular season MVP awards (1959, 1961-63, 1965), good for second all-time behind [[Kareem Abdul Jabbar]]'s six awards and matching the career total of [[Michael Jordan]]. In 1970, the Sporting News named Russell the "Athlete of the Decade".  Russell is universally seen as one of the best NBA players ever,<ref name="hoopshall">{{cite web | last = hoophall.com | first = | title = Bill Russell NBA Hall of Fame summary | url=http://www.hoophall.com/halloffamers/RussellW.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref><ref name="nbacomsummary">{{cite web | last = nba.com | first = | title = Bill Russell nba.com summary | url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/russell_bio.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> and was declared "Greatest Player in the History of the NBA" by the Professional Basketball Writers Association of America in 1980.<ref name="hoopshall"> </ref>

However, despite his incredible success, it is remarkable how much Russell and the Celtics were shunned by the Boston public. During Russell's career, the crowd averaged a mere 8,406 fans, thousands short of a sellout. Sportswriter Dave Zirin stated a factor were the other popular local franchises, like the [[Boston Red Sox]] and the [[Boston Bruins]], but another factor was contemporary racism. Zirin recalled that Russell was a constant victim of racial abuse, and when Russell protested, the press was quick to point out his alleged "bad attitude".<ref name="zirin2">{{cite web | last = Zirin | first = Dave | title = Barry Bonds vs. Boston | url=http://www.counterpunch.org/zirin06232004.html | accessdate = 2007-02-09 }}</ref> When Russell once tried to move from his home in the Boston suburb of [[Reading, Massachusetts]] to a new home across town in 1968, [[Tom Heinsohn]] recalled his would-be neighbours filed a petition trying to block the move, and when that failed, other neighbors banded together to try to purchase the home that Russell wanted to buy.<ref name="zirin2">{{cite web | last = Zirin | first = Dave | title = Barry Bonds vs. Boston | url=http://www.counterpunch.org/zirin06232004.html | accessdate = 2007-02-09 }}</ref> Vandals broke into Russell's home and defecated on his bed.

==Personal life==
[[Image: Russell 100 030119.jpg|left|thumb|Bill Russell in 2003]]
Russell is the son of Katie and Charlie Russell, whose family also included the noted playwright [[Charlie L. Russell]], Russell's older brother. Russell himself was married to his college sweetheart Rose Swisher from 1956 <U+2013> 1973, with whom he had three children, namely daughter [[Karen Russell]], the television pundit and lawyer, and sons William Jr. and Jacob. When Rose and Russell [[divorce]]d, he married former "Miss USA" of 1968, Dorothy Anstett, in 1977 whom he also eventually divorced.<ref>{{cite web | last = nndb.com | first = | title = Bill Russell @ nndb.com |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/783/000023714/ | accessdate = 2007-01-01 }}</ref> In addition, Russell was close friends with his perennial opponent Wilt Chamberlain. It should be noted however that Russell never considered Chamberlain his rival and disliked the term, instead pointing out that they rarely talked about basketball. When Chamberlain died in 1999, Chamberlain<U+2019>s nephew stated that Russell was the second person he was ordered to break the news to.<ref name="chat">{{cite web | last = Russell | first = Bill | title = Chat Transcript: Celtics Legend Bill Russell @ celtics.com | url=http://www.nba.com/celtics/chat/russell_050228.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> Asked about his idols, Russell has stated that his childhood hero was his father, and regarding basketball, his idol was [[Minneapolis Lakers]] superstar [[George Mikan|George <U+201C>Mr. Basketball<U+201D> Mikan]], whom he met when he was in high school.<ref name="chat">{{cite web | last = Russell | first = Bill | title = Chat Transcript: Celtics Legend Bill Russell @ celtics.com | url=http://www.nba.com/celtics/chat/russell_050228.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref><!--He was exceptionally active in the [[American Civil Rights Movement]]. {{fact}} Russell was also active in the [[Black Power]] movement. He was often called "Felton X" and he even purchased land in Liberia. {{fact}}-->

Russell's life was marked of an uphill battle against [[racism]]. As a child, the young Russell witnessed how his parents were victims of racist abuse, and eventually moved into housing projects to escape the daily torrent of bigotry.<ref name="Current">{{cite web | last = Thompson | first = Tim | title = Bill Russell overcame long odds, dominated basketball | url=http://www.thecurrentonline.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&uStory_id=d9770e44-d716-4359-8710-3a2be480029e

</ref> When he later became a standout amateur basketball player at USF, Russell bitterly recalled how he and his few fellow African-American colleagues were jeered at by white students.<ref name="jwr">{{cite web | last = Matthews | first = Chris | title =  Bill Russell and American racism | url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/matthews042800.asp | accessdate = 2007-02-09 }}</ref>

Even after he became a superstar on the Boston Celtics, Russell was the victim of racial abuse. Once, he refused to play a game when he and his black teammates were refused service at a local restaurant in 1962.<ref name="espn">{{cite web | last = Flatter | first = Ron | title = Russell was a proud, fierce warrior | url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016449.html
 | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> Matters in Boston were made worse by a hostile press failing to acknowledge Russell's torment, instead citing Russell's perceived "bad attitude" as the problem.  <ref name="zirin2">{{cite web | last = Zirin | first = Dave | title = Barry Bonds vs. Boston | url=http://www.counterpunch.org/zirin06232004.html | accessdate = 2007-02-09 }}</ref> "I didn't play for Boston," he once said, "I played for the Celtics."<ref name="zirin2"> </ref> While the Celtics founded the most successful sports dynasty of all time, bringing in 11 NBA championships in 13 years, the [[Boston Garden]] was snubbed by the local sports fans. During Russell's career, the crowd averaged a mere 8,406 fans, thousands short of a sellout. By contrast, the Celtics teams of the 1980's led by white legend [[Larry Bird]] sold out the 14,890-seat Garden for 662 straight games.<ref name="zirin2">{{cite web | last = Zirin | first = Dave | title = Barry Bonds vs. Boston | url=http://www.counterpunch.org/zirin06232004.html | accessdate = 2007-02-09 }}</ref> The worst case of bigotry was recalled by Russell's white Celtics team mate [[Tom Heinsohn]]. He recalled the instance when Russell tried to move from his home in the Boston suburb of [[Reading, Massachusetts|Reading]] to a new home across town in 1968. His would-be neighbors filed a petition trying to block the move, and when that failed, other neighbors banded together to try to purchase the home that Russell wanted to buy.<ref name="zirin2">{{cite web | last = Zirin | first = Dave | title = Barry Bonds vs. Boston | url=http://www.counterpunch.org/zirin06232004.html | accessdate = 2007-02-09 }}</ref> Vandals broke into Russell's home and defecated on his bed. This event that led him to call the city of [[Boston]] a "flea market of [[racism]]".<ref>{{cite web

Russell went to the mayor's home, woke him up, and returned the key.<ref name="zirin2">{{cite web | last = Zirin | first = Dave | title = Barry Bonds vs. Boston | url=http://www.counterpunch.org/zirin06232004.html | accessdate = 2007-02-09 }}</ref>

These hostile reactions made Russell sullen and wary. Similar to fellow NBA center legend [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], who was known to be very aloof,<ref>{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2006-12-05 }}</ref> Russell was known for his deep mistrust against the media, and was also notorious for his refusal to sign [[autograph]]s. He stated: "You owe the public the same it owes you -- nothing". In addition, Russell neither was present in person when his Number 6 jersey was retired in 1972, nor when he was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1975, shunning the limelight both times.<ref name="espn">{{cite web | last = Flatter | first = Ron | title = Russell was a proud, fierce warrior | url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016449.html
 | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> Russell has stated that his experiences hardened him against abuse of all kinds and he never permitted himself to be a victim, denying the bigots their triumph. He said: "I was a man first and basketball player second. I did not want people to define me by what I did for my profession."<ref>{{cite web
