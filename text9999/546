A '''poet''' is a person who writes [[poetry]]. A poet's work can be literal, meaning that his work is derived from a specific event, or metaphorical, meaning that his work can take on many meanings and forms. Poets have existed since antiquity, in nearly all languages, and have produced works that vary greatly in different cultures and time periods.<ref name=Orban>{{cite book |last=Orban |first=Clara Elizabeth |title=The Culture of Fragments: Word and Images in Futurism and Surrealism |publisher=Rodopi |year=1997 |page=3 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KbCVyt6MWg0C |isbn=90-420-0111-9}}</ref> Throughout each civilization and language, poets have used various styles that have changed through the course of literary history, resulting in a history of poets as diverse as the literature they have produced. 

The English word "poet" is derived from the [[French language|French]] ''po<U+00E8>te'', itself descended from the [[Latin]] first-declension masculine noun ''poeta'', meaning "poet".  The word "poetry" derives from the Latin feminine noun ''poetria'', meaning not "poetry" but "poetess".

[[French people|French]] poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]] summarized the "poet" by writing:<blockquote>"A poet makes himself a visionary through a long, boundless, and systematized disorganization of all the senses. All forms of love, of suffering, of madness; he searches himself, he exhausts within himself all poisons, and preserves their quintessences. Unspeakable torment, where he will need the greatest faith, a superhuman strength, where he becomes all men: the great invalid, the great criminal, the great accursed<U+2014>and the Supreme Scientist! For he attains the unknown! Because he has cultivated his soul, already rich, more than anyone! He attains the unknown, and, if demented, he finally loses the understanding of his visions, he will at least have seen them! So what if he is destroyed in his ecstatic flight through things unheard of, unnameable: other horrible workers will come; they will begin at the horizons where the first one has fallen!"</blockquote>

Although that is only one opinion of many on a poet's definition.<ref name=Rimbaud>{{cite book |last=Rimbaud |first=Arthur |title=Illuminations, and Other Prose Poems |editor=Louise Var<U+00E8>se |publisher=New Directions Publishing |year=1957 |page=xxx |oclc=6555779 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DfbBV81bQf0C}}</ref>


[[William Wordsworth]] once described the poet's task as to: <blockquote>
"A present joy the matter of a song,

Pour forth that day my soul in measured strains

That would not be forgotten and are here

Recorded"</blockquote> ([[The Prelude]] Book 1)

[[Marianne Moore]] famously described the poet's job as creating "imaginary gardens with real toads in them".(Poetry)

Many poets such as [[Virgil]] in the [[Aeneid]] and [[John Milton]] in [[Paradise Lost]] invoke the aid of a [[Muse]] to help them in their tasks.
