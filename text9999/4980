'''Bridget "Didge" Napier''' ([[married and maiden names|n<U+00E9>e]] '''Hale''', previously '''Parker''') is a [[fictional character]] from the Australian [[soap opera]] ''[[Neighbours]]'', played by [[Eloise Mignon]]. In 2007, the show's focus returned to focus more on family dynamics and the character of Bridget and her family were created and introduced to help boost falling ratings in Australia. Bridget made her first on-screen appearance on 23 July 2007. She arrived in [[Erinsborough]] from Sydney with her father and mother, Steve and Miranda. During her time in ''Neighbours'', Bridget's storylines included being run over by [[Susan Kennedy]], falling in love with [[Declan Napier]], finding her birth mother and falling pregnant at 17. In March 2009, the decision was taken to write the Parker family out of the show after both Mignon and [[Steve Bastoni]] quit. Mignon wanted to return to her studies and she had had enough of ''Neighbours''. Bridget died on-screen on 21 July 2009 after suffering internal injuries, which she sustained in a car crash.

==Character development==
===Characterisation===
Bridget has been portrayed out of conjunction with the [[stereotype|stereotypical]] 'girly image', she is sporty and athletic.<ref name="lb"/> Mignon has described her as open, honest, outdoor kind of girl.<ref name="lb"/> Stating that like herself Bridget had grown up with keen interests for climbing trees, cycling and swimming in rivers, non typical female interests.<ref name="lb"/> She also branded Bridget as a 'sporty tomboy'.<ref name="lb"/> During an interview, Mignon said that Bridget's relationship with Declan changes her and she feels more independent from her family.<ref name="Love">{{cite video|url=http://neighbours.com.au/video.htm|people=Eloise Mignon and James Sorensen|date=2008|title=Declan and Didge Teenage Love|time=4.04|format=FLV|medium=Website production|publisher=[[Network Ten]]|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref> She also becomes more determined as a person.<ref name="Love"/>

===Disability===
One of Bridget's first high-profile storylines was coping with a disability, after [[Susan Kennedy]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]) hit Bridget with her car.<ref name="lb"/> She had been paralysed on one side of her body, the storyline saw her trying to regain the complete use of her body. Mignon explained during an interview with media reporting website Last Broadcast, the research that had been carried out and the effects on the character stating: "Bridget suffers extreme physical difficulties as a result, because she's such a sporty tomboy, to be incapacitated suddenly poses emotional problems for her. To make sure that I could understand better what Bridget's going through, I studied medical notes on paralysis and disability on the internet."<ref name="lb">{{cite news|url=http://www.lastbroadcast.co.uk/soaps/interviews/v/3152-eloise-mignon-neighbours-bridget-parker-interview.html|title=Eloise Mignon (Neighbours' Bridget Parker) Interview|publisher=Last Broadcast|author=|date=February 2008|accessdate=23 March 2010}}</ref> The storyline also explored self image issues that come with disabilities, in one episode Bridget was doing [[physiotherapy]] exercises and became in danger of drowning until [[Declan Napier]] ([[James Sorensen]]) saved her.<ref name="sun"/> He tried to kiss her but she fended off his advances, of this Mignon said: "Bridget pushes him off, she fears he'll see her differently due to her disability."<ref name="sun">{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/article727958.ece|title=Neighbours: Dec saves day|work=[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]|publisher=[[News International]]|author=Brand, Claire|date=26 January 2008|accessdate=23 March 2010}}</ref>

===Teen pregnancy===
One of the most important storylines for the character of Bridget was when she discovered that she was pregnant with Declan's child. As the storyline progressed, Bridget was seen considering abortion or adoption, before ultimately deciding to have the child with Declan's support.<ref name="News.com"/><ref name="BridgetBio"/> This caused controversy among conservative family groups in Australia who accused the ''Neighbours'' of using their chartacters to normalise teenage pregnancy.<ref name="PlotAttacked">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a149490/neighbours-attacked-for-teen-pregnancy-plot.html|title='Neighbours' attacked for teen pregnancy plot|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi (UK) Ltd]]|first=Darren|last=Rowe|date=13 March 2009|accessdate=27 February 2010}}</ref> Pro-Family Perspectives director Angela Conway said: "[Teenage pregnancy] is not something that should be considered the norm, programmes like ''Neighbours'' can make the behaviours that lead to teenage pregnancy seem normal and acceptable. A lot of kids just aren't ready to get their head around details of explicit sexuality."<ref name="PlotAttacked"/> ''Neighbours'' exectutive producer [[Susan Bower]] defended her character's storyline stating: "I am quite sure a lot of people are not happy with this storyline. We decided we would show the ramifications on the teenagers' lives."<ref name="PlotAttacked"/> Mignon said that the storyline between Declan and Bridget was not shallow, trite or vulgar, further adding she would not have liked to film the storyline if it was and branded it as showing emotional spectrum of pregnancy justice.<ref name="PlotAttacked"/> Critics also slammed the show, noting that ''Neighbours'' has a G-rating and the storyline could lead to more promiscuity and teenage pregnancies among young viewers.<ref name="PlotAttacked"/> The storyline continued despite the controversy it caused and Declan and Bridget became parents to a daughter, [[List of Neighbours characters (2009)#India Napier|India]].
