==Early life and career==
Bengough was born on 25 November 1837, and educated at [[Rugby School]] in [[Warwickshire]] from 1851.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/rugbyschool00braduoft/rugbyschool00braduoft_djvu.txt Rugby School]</ref>

He was added to the Commander-in-Chief<U+2019>s list of potential officers in February 1853, aged barely 16. He was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] [[ensign (rank)|ensign]] by [[Sale of commissions|purchase]] in the [[77th Regiment of Foot]] on 22 March 1855,<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=21682|startpage=1179|date=23 March 1855|accessdate=2008-12-08}}</ref> and promoted [[first lieutenant|lieutenant]] on 3 October of the same year.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=21812|startpage=4131|date=9 November 1855|accessdate=2008-12-08}}</ref>  He achieved his [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captaincy]] by purchase on 30 December 1864.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=22925|startpage=6806|date=30 December 1864|accessdate=2008-12-08}}</ref> He was granted a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[major (United Kingdom)|majority]] on 1 October 1877<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=24508|startpage=5462|endpage=5463|date=2 October 1877|accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref> which was made substantive on 2 February 1878.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=24561|startpage=1945|date=12 March 1878|accessdate=2008-12-08}}</ref>

Bengough was versed in languages and used that skill to produced a booklet on the [[Zulu language]] just before he left England.<ref name="Commandants">{{cite paper|first=Keith I.|last=Smith|author=|title=The Commandants: The Leadership of the Natal Native Contingent in the Anglo-Zulu War|version=Thesis|publisher=University of Western Australia|date=October 2005

==The Anglo-Zulu Wars==

Lt-Col Bengough arrived in Natal with the 77th Foot in December 1878. He was placed in command of the 2nd Battalion [[Natal Native Contingent]], which formed part of [[Anthony Durnford|Durnford]]<U+2019>s [http://www.rorkesdriftvc.com/isandhlwana/durnford.htm] [[Column (formation)|Column]], and which was left to protect the frontier at [[Kranskop|Kranz Kop]] on the departure of that force to join [[John Plumptre Carr Glyn|Glyn]]<U+2019>s Column.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=24699|startpage=2369|endpage=2370|date=21 March 1879|accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref> He crossed the Buffalo River in command of the battalion on 22 January 1879. On receipt of the news of the disaster at [[Battle of Isandlwana|Isandlwana]], he hastened towards [[Rorke's Drift]], intending to join the General<U+2019>s force. En route, he received orders to proceed to Helpmakaar near [[Dundee, KwaZulu-Natal]]. Bengough was ordered to Umsinga, where, despite the desertion of large numbers of his men, he constructed Fort Bengough. He joined the division of General Edward Newdigate in May, in command of the battalion of which the numbers had increased and the discipline improved. He and the battalion took part in the advance into Zululand. He commanded the headquarters and three companies which were present at the [[Battle of Ulundi]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bengough|first=Harcourt Mortimer|date=February 27, 2002|title=Memories of a Soldier's Life|pages=124|publisher=Adamant Media Corporation|isbn=1-4021-9252-5|accessdate=13 December 2008|url=http://books.google.com/?id=bAtmQV1U1xgC&pg=PA124&dq=Harcourt+Mortimer+Bengough+Ulundi}}</ref> Bengough was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] by General Newdigate on 6 July 1879, who reported the good service rendered by the battalion in scouting and outpost duties during the action.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=24754|startpage=5105|endpage=5106|date=21 August 1879|accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref> Bengough then served in command of the battalion in [[Baker Russell|Russell]]<U+2019>s Column until the capture of the King [[Cetshwayo kaMpande|Cetewayo]], when it was disbanded.<ref>[http://www.ecomallbiz.com/easy67/generalstaff/ The Anglo Zulu War Historical Society]</ref>

Bengough visited the [[kraal]] near where the [[Prince Imperial]] was killed and recalled that he 'brought away as a memento of the sad event a [[Knobkierrie|knobkerry stick]], which I found in the kraal, and which now hangs in the hall of my house.' In the wake of a famous battle, especially one that marked the culmination of a war such as Ulundi on 4 July 1879, every European involved in the battle appeared to want to own an object that could serve as a reminder of the event.<ref>[http://www.michaelstevenson.com/africanart/essay.htm Michael Stevenson Art: Weapons Essay]</ref>

==Interest in sport==

Whilst commanding the 1st Infantry Brigade in Aldershot in the 1890s he expressed the opinion that: "There can be no better pastime for soldiers than football, combining as it does skill, judgment, pluck. resource, activity &mdash; all soldierly qualities &mdash; and affording amusement to all, from the recruit enjoying the humble punt-about on the parade groundto the crowds of enthusiasts keenly watching a hard contested struggle for the final ties for the Army Cup."<ref>{{cite paper  | first = JD  | last =  Campbell  | author =   | authorlink =   | title = The Army Isn<U+2019>t All work.
