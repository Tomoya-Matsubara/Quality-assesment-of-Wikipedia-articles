'''Dave Van Ronk''' ([[June 30]] [[1936]] &ndash; [[February 10]] [[2002]]) was a [[folk singer]] born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]], who settled in [[Greenwich Village]], [[New York City]], and was nicknamed the "[[Mayor]] of MacDougal Street." 

He was best known as an important figure in New York City during the [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic]] [[blues]] revival of the 1960s, but his work ranged from old English [[ballads]] to [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[rock (music)|rock]], [[Dixieland|New Orleans]] [[jazz]], and [[swing (genre)|swing]]. He  became known for performing instrumental [[ragtime]] [[guitar]] music, and he was an early friend and supporter of [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Phil Ochs]] and [[Joni Mitchell]], among many others. Van Ronk was very influential on the music scene in [[New York City]] in the [[1960s]]. 

==Career==

Van Ronk moved from [[Brooklyn]] to [[Queens]] in 1951 and began attending Richmond Hill High School. He had been performing in a [[Barbershop music|barbershop quartet]] since 1949, but left before finishing high school, and spent the next few years bumming around lower Manhattan, except for shipping out twice with the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]]. 

His first professional gigs were with various trad jazz bands around the New York area, of which he later observed: "We wanted to play traditional jazz in the worst way...and we did!" The jazz revival didn't take off though, and Van Ronk turned to performing blues music he'd stumbled across and enjoyed years earlier, by artists like [[Furry Lewis]] and [[Mississippi John Hurt]]. Van Ronk was not the first white musician to perform African-American blues, but became noted for his interpretation of it in its original context. By about 1958 he was firmly committed to the folk-blues style, accompanying himself with his own acoustic guitar. He performed [[blues]], [[jazz]] and [[folk music]], occasionally writing his own songs but generally arranging the work of earlier artists and his folk revival peers. 

He became noted both for his large physical stature and his expansive charisma, which belied an intellectual, cultured gentleman of many talents. Among his many interests: cooking, [[science fiction]] (he was active for some time in [[science fiction fandom]] and contributed to [[science fiction fanzines|fanzines]]), world history, and politics. During the 1960s he supported radical left-wing political causes and was a member of the [[Libertarian League]].  Somewhat by accident, he took part in the famous [[Stonewall Riots]] during which he was arrested, abused and briefly jailed. In 1974 he appeared at a concert with his old friend [[Bob Dylan]], to aid refugees from the military coup by [[Augusto Pinochet]] in [[Chile]].

In 2000 he performed at Blind Willie's in [[Atlanta]], clothed in garish [[Hawaii]]an garb, speaking fondly of his impending return to Greenwich Village. He reminisced over tunes like ''Good Ol Wagon'', a song teasing a washed-up lover, which he ruefully remarked had seemed humorous to him back in 1962. He was married to Terri Thal in the 1960s, lived for many years with Joanne Grace, then married Andrea Vuocolo, with whom he spent the rest of his life. He continued to perform for four decades and gave his last concert just a few months before his death.  He found it amusing to be called "a legend in his own time."

Van Ronk died before completing work on his memoirs, which were finished by his collaborator, Elijah Wald, and published in 2005 as ''The Mayor Of MacDougal Street''. In 2004 a section of Sheridan Square, where Barrow Street meets Washington Place, was renamed Dave Van Ronk Street in his memory.

==Cultural impact==

He has been described as an irreverent and incomparable guitar artist and interpreter of black blues and folk, with an uncannily precise ability at improvisation. [[Joni Mitchell]] often said that his rendition of her song ''[[Both Sides Now (song)|Both Sides Now]]'' (which he called ''Clouds'') was the finest ever. 

Dave Van Ronk is perhaps underestimated as a musician and blues guitarist.  His guitar work is noteworthy for both syncopation and precision. In its simplest form, it shows similarities to [[Mississippi John Hurt]]'s, but Van Ronk's main influence was the [[Reverend Gary Davis]], who conceived the guitar as "a piano around his neck." Van Ronk took this pianistic approach, and added a harmonic sophistication adapted from the band voicings of Jelly Roll Morton and Duke Ellington. He ranks high in bringing blues style to Greenwich Village during the 1960s, as well as introducing the folk world to the complex harmonies of [[Kurt Weill]] in his many Brecht-Weill interpretations, and being one of the very few hardcore traditional revivalists to move with the times, bringing old blues and ballads together with the new sounds of Dylan, Mitchell, and Leonard Cohen. During this crucial period, he performed with the likes of [[Bob Dylan]] and spent many years teaching guitar in Greenwich Village. He influenced his protege [[Danny Kalb]] and [[The Blues Project]]. The Japanese singer [[Masato Tomobe]] and American pop-folk singer [[Geoff Thais]] learned from him as well.

Thanks to what he had learned from Davis, Van Ronk was among the first to adapt traditional jazz and ragtime to the solo acoustic guitar. His guitar arrangements of such ragtime hits as ''St. Louis Tickle,'' ''The Entertainer,'' ''The Pearls'' and ''Maple Leaf Rag'' continue to frustrate and challenge aspiring guitar players. He also did fine compositions of his own in the classic styles, such as ''Antelope Rag.''

==Personal characteristics==

Van Ronk refused for many years to fly and never learned to drive (he would use trains or buses or, when possible, recruit a girlfriend or young musician as his driver), and he declined to ever move from Greenwich Village. Van Ronk's trademark [[stoneware]] jug of [[Tullamore Dew]] was frequently seen on stage next to him in his early days.

[[Robert Shelton]] described Van Ronk as, "the musical mayor of MacDougal Street, a tall, garrulous hairy man of three quarters, or, more accurately, three fifths Irish descent. Topped by light brownish hair and a leonine beard, which he smoothed down several times a minute, he resembled an unmade bed strewn with books, record jackets, pipes, empty whiskey bottles,lines from obscure poets, finger picks, and broken guitar strings. He was Bob (Dylan's) first New York guru. Van Ronk was a walking museum of the blues. Through an early interest in jazz, he had gravitated toward black music -- its jazz pole, its jug-band and ragtime center, its blues bedrock.....his manner was rough and testy, disguising a warm, sensitive core. Van Ronk retold the blues intimately....for a time, his most dedicated follower was Dylan."

==Miscellania==
Dave is mentioned along with other deceased music artists (and [[Doris Day]], who is still alive) in [[the Who]]'s 2006 song, "Mirror Door."

The line "When the sacred ginmill closes" from the song ''Last Call''  is the title of a [[Matthew Scudder]] mystery by [[Lawrence Block]].
