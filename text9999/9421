'''William A. Donohue''' (born July 18, 1947 in [[Manhattan, New York]]), has been the president of the [[Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights]] in the [[United States]] since 1993.  It claims to be the largest [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] civil rights organization in the United States. He is known for his public statements on matters that the Catholic League believes relate to the defamation of and the civil rights of [[Catholics]] in particular and [[Christians]] in general.

== Biography == 	 
William A. Donohue began his teaching career in the 1970s working at St. Lucy's School in [[Spanish Harlem]].  In 1977, he took a position as a college professor teaching at [[La Roche College]] in [[McCandless, Pennsylvania]]. In 1980 he received a [[doctorate]] in [[Sociology]] from [[New York University]] (NYU).<ref name=bio>[http://www.catholicleague.org/about.php Official bio]</ref>

His first book was ''The Politics of the American Civil Liberties Union'' and he became associated with the conservative [[Heritage Foundation]] where he is an adjunct scholar. His books on the [[ACLU]] made him one of the group's most prominent critics and firebrands.

While Donohue was in college in New York, Virgil C. Blum, a Jesuit at [[Marquette University]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], founded the Catholic League to counter [[Anti-Catholicism]] in [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].  Blum died in 1990; in 1993, Dr. Donohue became the director of the organization.  Under his direction, the organization has become far more prominent and vocal.

Donohue publishes ''The Catalyst,'' the Catholic League journal.  He serves on the board of directors of the National Association of Scholars.  He serves on the board of advisers of the Washington Legal Foundation, the Howard Center for Family, Religion & Society, Society of Catholic Social Scientists, Catholics United for the Faith, Ave Maria Institute, the Christian Film & Television Commission and Catholic War Veterans.  He has received several awards from the Catholic community and was voted one of the top 100 Catholics of the 20th century in a survey of Catholics conducted by the internet site, Daily Catholic. He received the 2005 St. Thomas More Award for Catholic Citizenship from Catholic Citizens of Illinois.

The Catholic League is registered as a [[501(c)(3)]] not-for-profit organization.  In 2006, according to its [[Form 990]], its revenue was $16,590,333, and Donohue's salary and benefits amounted to $343,420.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2006/237/279/2006-237279981-037482be-9.pdf |title=Form 990 |publisher=Guidestar.org}}</ref>

Donohue is a staunch defender of [[Mel Gibson]]'s controversial movie ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''. On the December 8, 2004 broadcast of ''[[Scarborough Country]]'', in a discussion of the film  Donohue claimed, "Hollywood is controlled by secular [[Jew]]s who hate [[Christianity]] in general and [[Catholicism]] in particular. It's not a secret, OK? And I'm not afraid to say it. That's why they hate this movie. It's about [[Jesus Christ]], and it's about truth. It's about the [[Messiah]]." This statement was called anti-Semitic by [[Shmuley Boteach|Rabbi Shmuley Boteach]] on that same show. Donohue defended this statements as follows: "In short, I did not single out secular Jews as some have said.  Nonetheless, I do regret using the verb "controlled", and that is because it suggests that there is some kind of cabal among secular Jews.  That's nonsense.  But is there a segment of the secular Jewish community that is anti-Catholic? Absolutely."

He has criticized Christmas cards sent by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] using the term "Holidays" instead of "Christmas" on the [[White House]]"<ref>Davis, Matthew [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4512156.stm Lines drawn in battle over Christmas], [[BBC News]], December 10, 2005</ref>, as well as [[Mike Huckabee]]<U+2019>s use of what Donahue claims is Christian imagery for campaign purposes<ref>{{cite news | first=David | last=Edwards | coauthors= | title=Catholic League president slams Huckabee for 'subliminal' cross ad | date=2007-12-18 | url =http://rawstory.com/news/2007/Fox_rips_Huckabee_for_using_subliminal_1218.html | work =[[The Raw Story]] | accessdate = 2008-11-26}}</ref>

Moreover, he has protested employment discrimination against Catholics, in the case of a woman required by her supervisor to remove the Ash Wednesday ashes from her forehead<ref>[http://www.catholic-league.com/catalyst/1997_catalyst/497catalyst.htm#WORKPLACE%20DISCRIMINATION%20CHECKED%20IN%20SAN%20DIEGO Workplace Discrimination Checked in San Diego] ''The Catalyst'', Volume 24, Number 3, April 2005</ref> and he has also spoken of the crisis over sexual abuse perpetrated by Catholic priests as "a homosexual scandal, not a pedophilia scandal".<ref name=autogenerated1> Creager, Cindi [http://www.glaad.org/action/alerts_detail.php?id=3835 NBC's Today Provides Platform for Defamatory Anti-Gay Attacks], ''[[GLAAD]] Alert'', October 14, 2005</ref><ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>  Anthony, [http://www.bishop-accountability.org/news2005_01_06/2005_06_30_Farmer_NYBills.htm N.Y.

== Parody ==

On April 4, 2007, ''[[South Park]]'' parodied Donohue in the eleventh season episode "[[Fantastic Easter Special]]" as a power-hungry official of the Catholic Church who overthrows [[Pope Benedict XVI|the Pope]] and sentences [[Jesus]] ("The Jew") to death for going against him and contradicting Catholic belief. In the show, the fictional Donohue calls Stan and Kyle,  "whores". Subsequently, Jesus kills Donohue.
