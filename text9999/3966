'''Nuu-chah-nulth''' (also called '''Nootka''', and '''T'aat'aaqsapa''') is a [[Wakashan languages|Wakashan language]] spoken in the [[Pacific Northwest]] of [[North America]], on the west coast of [[Vancouver Island]] from [[Barkley Sound]] to [[Quatsino Sound]] in [[British Columbia]], by the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people]]. Nuu-chah-nulth is a [[Southern Wakashan languages|Southern Wakashan language]] related to [[Nitinaht language|Nitinaht]] and [[Makah language|Makah]]. 

Kim (2003) estimates the number of Nuu-chah-nulth speakers at approximately 150<U+2013>200, while the 2001 [[Canadian census]] puts the figure at about 505. [[Linguists]] find the language fascinating because of its [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] and [[phonology|phonological]] complexity. 

It is the first language of the [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] to have documentary written materials describing it. In the 1780s [[George Vancouver|Captains Vancouver]], [[Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra|Quadra]], and other European explorers and traders frequented [[Nootka Sound]] and the other Nuu-chah-nulth communities, making reports of their voyages. From 1803<U+2013>1805 [[John R. Jewitt]], an English [[blacksmith]], was held captive by chief ''[[Maquinna]]'' at [[Nootka Sound]]. He made an effort to learn the language, and in 1815 published a memoir with a brief [[glossary]] of its terms.

#Of the alveolar consonants, nasal and laterals are apico-alveolar while the rest are denti-alveolar.
#Glottalized resonants (nasals and approximants) are realized as resonants with pre-glottalization. They are arguably conceptually{{Vague|date=February 2010}} the same as ejective consonants.
#{{IPA|/<U+0295>/}} is an [[Approximant consonant|approximant]], not a [[Fricative consonant|fricative]] (The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] does not have a unique symbol for this sound). This [[phoneme]] is more often [[epiglottal consonant|epiglottal]] and functions phonologically as a [[Pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] stop.

The pharyngeal consonants developed from mergers of [[uvular]] sounds; {{IPA|/<U+0127>/}} derives from a merger of {{IPA|/<U+03C7>/}} and {{IPA|/<U+03C7><U+02B7>/}} (which are now comparatively rare) while {{IPA|/<U+0295>/}} came about from a merger of {{IPA|/q<U+02BC>/}} and {{IPA|/q<U+02B7><U+02BC>/}} (which are now absent from the language).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Carlson et al.|2001|p=277}}</ref>

In the environment of glottalized resonants as well as ejective and pharyngeal consonants, vowels can be "laryngealized" which often means [[creaky voice]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In general, syllable weight determines stress placement; short vowels followed by non-glottalized consonants and long vowels are heavy. In sequences where there are no heavy syllables or only heavy syllables, the first syllable is stressed.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Nuu-chah-nulth has phonemic short and long vowels. Traditionally, a third class of vowels, known as "variable length" vowels, is recognized. These are vowels that are long when they are found within the first two syllables of a word, and short elsewhere.

==Vocabulary==
The Nuu-chah-nulth language contributed many words to the vocabulary of the [[Chinook Jargon]] and it is believed that oceanic commerce and exchanges between the Nuu-chah-nulth and other Southern Wakashan speakers with the [[Chinookan]]-speaking peoples of the lower Columbia River led to the foundations of the trade jargon that became known as [[Chinook Jargon|Chinook]] in later years. Nootkan words in [[Chinook Jargon]] include ''hiyu'' - "many", from Nuu-chah-nulth for "ten", ''siah'' - "far", from the Nuu-chah-nulth for "sky".

A dictionary of the language, with some 7,500 entries, was created after 15 years of research. It is based on both work with current speakers and notes from linguist [[Edward Sapir]], taken almost a century ago. The dictionary, however, is a subject of controversy, with a number of Nuu-chah-nulth elders questioning the accuracy of the terminology, and the author's right to represent their language.

Some of the names following (Ditidaht, Makah) are not part of the Nuu-chah-nulth political organization, however; all are "Aht" (people). The term Nuu-chah-nulth-aht is also used, meaning "people all along the mountains and the sea."
