'''James Howard "Jim" Thome''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|t|o<U+028A>|m|i}};<ref>{{cite web|title=Jim Thome Stats|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/2604/jim-thome|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> born August 27, 1970) is an American [[professional baseball|baseball]] [[designated hitter]] and [[first baseman]]. He has played for the [[Cleveland Indians]], [[Philadelphia Phillies]], [[Chicago White Sox]], [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], [[Minnesota Twins]], and [[Baltimore Orioles]]. Thome is a [[free agent]]. In 1996, Thome won the [[Silver Slugger Award]] and in 2006, he won the [[Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year Award|Comeback Player of the Year Award]]. He has also received the [[Roberto Clemente Award]] (2002), [[Babe Ruth Home Run Award]] (2003), and [[Lou Gehrig Memorial Award]] (2004). In 2011, he became the eighth MLB player to hit 600 home runs (HR). He has hit the seventh-most home runs of all-time with 612 and is 24th all-time for [[runs batted in]] (RBIs) with 1,699. 

Thome was part of the Cleveland Indians core group of players who led the franchise to two [[World Series]] appearances in three years during the mid-1990s. After spending over a decade with Cleveland, Thome signed a free agent contract with the Philadelphia Phillies, where he spent the next three seasons of his career. Traded to the White Sox before the 2006 season, he played in Chicago for three more seasons and joined the [[500 home run club]]. After a brief stint with the Dodgers, Thome played with the Minnesota Twins for two seasons before returning to Cleveland and then Philadelphia. He was traded to the Baltimore Orioles in 2012; at the end of the season he filed for free agency. 

Throughout his career, Thome's strength has been power hitting. In six different seasons, he has hit more than 40 home runs; his career [[on-base plus slugging]] (OPS) of .956 is 19th all-time. Later in his career, repeated back injuries which kept him from playing the field much. He primarily was a designated hitter. Thome is known for his batting stance, in which he holds the bat out with his right hand and points it at right field before the pitcher is ready to throw, which he first saw in ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]'';<ref name="best DH"/> and his constant positive attitude.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Posnanski|first=Joe|title=Still Going Strong|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=27 September 2010|volume=113|issue=11|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1174607/4/index.htm|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Connolly|first=Dan|title=Veteran DH Jim Thome won't return to O's until September|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-08-06/sports/bs-sp-orioles-notes-0807-20120806_1_neck-spasms-orioles-manager-jim-thome|work=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=18 November 2012|date= 6 August 2012}}</ref>

==Early life==
Thome was born in [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]], [[Illinois]] on August 27, 1970, the youngest of five children. All the members of his family played sports. His grandmother was hired at a local [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] plant solely to play for the company's softball team. His father built bulldozers for Caterpillar and played slow-pitch softball.<ref name="humility grace country power"/> Thome's two older brothers, Chuck III and Randy, played baseball at [[Limestone Community High School District 310|Limestone High School]].<ref name="1998 si">{{cite journal|last=Bamberger|first=Michael|title=The Pride of Peoria|journal=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=13 July 1998|volume=89|issue=2|pages=98<U+2013>105|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1013325/index.htm|accessdate=26 April 2013}}</ref> Growing up, his favorite player was [[Dave Kingman]], and one day, while at [[Wrigley Field]] trying to get Kingman's autograph, he sneaked into the Cubs' clubhouse to try to find Kingman. Though to his dismay he ultimately did not get Kingman's autograph, he did get the autographs of several others, and, because of his childhood difficulties in getting autographs, now makes a point to sign autographs for fans.<ref name="1998 si"/>

Like his older brothers, Thome attended Limestone<ref name=IMDB>{{cite web|title=Jim Thome <U+2013> Biography|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0859761/bio|work=IMDB|accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref> where he achieved all-state honors in both baseball, playing shortstop, and basketball. Although he had hoped to be noticed by scouts, his relatively small stature ({{convert|6|ft|2|in|cm}} {{convert|175|lb|kg}}) meant that he attracted only passing interest. Thome graduated in 1988 and, after not being drafted, enrolled at [[Illinois Central College]] where he continued his baseball and basketball careers.<ref name="1998 si"/> After one season, he was drafted by the [[Cleveland Indians]] in the 13th round of the [[1989 Major League Baseball Draft]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Rogers|first=Phil|title=Jim Thome can't stop touching all the bases|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-144688355.html|accessdate=17 February 2013|newspaper=[[The Chicago Tribune]]|date=19 April 2006 | publisher=via [[HighBeam Research]] {{Subscription required}}}}</ref>

==Professional career==

===Cleveland Indians (1991<U+2013>2002)===
Thome was originally assigned to the [[GCL Indians|Gulf Coast League Indians]], where he played exclusively in 1989 posting a [[batting average]] (BA) of .237 with no home runs and 22 RBIs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jim Thome Career Profile|url=http://www.minorleagueball.com/2011/1/21/1949238/jim-thome-career-profile|work=Minor League Ball|accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref> After his rookie season, he met "hitting guru" [[Charlie Manuel]], who later was his manager and mentor. Unlike most Indians staff, Manuel saw potential in Thome and worked hard with him, particularly on how he used his hips in his swing. Thome later said, "He saw something in me I didn't." During this work, Manuel suggested to Thome that he point his bat out to center field before the pitch to relax himself like [[Roy Hobbs]] did in ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]'' when batting.<ref>{{cite web|last=Posnanski|first=Joe|title=He's 40, but Jim Thome's mind isn't on retirement - Page Three|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1174607/3/index.htm|work=SI Vault|publisher=Time|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=27 September 2010}}</ref> 

The work paid off; in 1990, Thome hit .340 and totaled 16 home runs and 50 RBIs playing at both the [[Minor League Baseball#Rookie|Rookie]] and [[Minor League Baseball#Class A|Class A]] levels. After splitting the 1991 season between [[Minor League Baseball#Double-A|Double-A]] and [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] where, in combination, he hit .319 with 7 home runs and 73 RBIs, Thome made his MLB debut on September 4, 1991, as a [[third baseman]] against the [[Minnesota Twins]]. In the game he had two hits in four at-bats (2-for-4) and recorded his first [[hit (baseball)|hit]]. He hit his first career home run on October 4. Injuries shortened Thome's 1992 campaign during which he played for both the Indians and the [[Colorado Springs Sky Sox]], the Indians' Triple-A affiliate at the time. He combined to play 52 games with 4 home runs and 26 RBIs while hitting .236.<ref name=WWIB>{{cite book|title=Who's Who in Baseball, 2007|year=2007|editor=Palmer, Pete|publisher=Who's Who in Baseball Magazine Co.|location=New York|isbn=0-910692-26-2|pages=169<U+2013>170}}</ref> Thome played mostly for the [[Charlotte Knights]], the Indians' new Triple-A affiliate, in 1993. He led the [[International League]] with a .332 batting average and 102 RBIs, complemented by 25 home runs. This performance earned him a late season call up in which he hit .266 with 7 home runs and 22 RBIs in 47 games.<ref name=WWIB />

In the 1994 offseason, Cleveland made several offseason acquisitions in an attempt to compete after six consecutive seasons with a losing record. [[Sandy Alomar Jr.]], [[Kenny Lofton]], [[Carlos Baerga]], and [[Mark Clark (baseball)|Mark Clark]] were brought in to work with Thome and 22-year-old [[Manny Ramirez]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Kazzie|first=David|title=After 40 years of futility, Tribe will dance to new drum|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mKMcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=q28EAAAAIBAJ&pg=5936,6330095&dq=cleveland+indians+1994+offseason&hl=en|accessdate=2 December 2012|newspaper=The Cavalier Daily|date=6 April 1994}}</ref> For the first time in his career, Thome spent the entire year with Cleveland, playing in 98 games while hitting .268 with 20 home runs and 52 RBIs.<ref name=BR>{{cite web|title=Jim Thome Statistics and History|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/t/thomeji01.shtml|work=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=29 October 2012}}</ref> This group led the Indians to within one game of the [[1994 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]]'s [[American League Central]] lead and a [[Major League Baseball Wild Card|wild card]] spot prior to [[1994<U+2013>95 Major League Baseball strike|the 1994 players' strike]], which forced cancellation of the season's remaining games.<ref name="The Baseball Chronicle">{{cite book|title=The Baseball Chronicle|year=2002|publisher=Publications International, Ltd.|location=Lincolnwood, Illinois|isbn=0-7853-7012-9|pages=592, 600, 616, 622, 650, 656}}</ref> During the strike-shortened season, Thome had his first career multi-home run game, hitting two solo home runs on June 22, 1994 against [[Detroit Tigers]]' pitcher [[John Doherty (pitcher)|John Doherty]].<ref name="multi hr">{{cite web|title=Box Score of game played on Wednesday, June 22, 1994 at Tiger Stadium|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/box-scores/boxscore.php?boxid=199406220DET|work=Baseball Almanac Box Scores|publisher=Baseball-Almanac|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref> Despite Thome's statistical improvement in 1994, it was not until {{mlby|1995}} that the Indians' success led to a playoff berth.

In 1997, Thome helped the Indians hit a club record 220 home runs, contributing 40 of them. Thome also totaled an American League high 120 [[base on balls|walks]] to go along with 102 RBIs. Cleveland returned to the [[1997 World Series|World Series]] that year powered by their record offense, but they lost to the Florida Marlins in seven games. Thome hit .286 with two home runs and four RBIs.<ref name=WWIB />

The next three seasons would not be as successful for either Thome or the Indians as the previous three had been.

The other two openings he was a part of were the 1994 Cleveland Indians when they opened Jacobs Field and the 2004 Philadelphia Phillies when they opened [[Citizens Bank Park]]. He hit his first home run with the Twins on April 8, during the Twins' season-opening road trip. On July 3, Thome hit his 573rd and 574th home runs.
