According to a prevailing [[Models of migration to the New World|New World migration model]], migrations of humans from [[Eurasia]] to the Americas took place via [[Beringia]], a [[land bridge]] which connected the two continents across what is now the [[Bering Strait]].

The use of the names "Indies" and "Indian" has served to imply some kind of racial or cultural unity for the aboriginal peoples of the Americas. Once created, the unified "Indian" was codified in law, religion, and politics. The unitary idea of "Indians" was not originally shared by indigenous peoples, but over the last two centuries many have embraced the identity. The term "Indian" does not include the [[Aleut people|Aleuts]], [[Inuit]], or [[Yupik peoples]], but despite this they are still part of the indigenous peoples of the Americas.

Although some indigenous peoples of the Americas were traditionally [[hunter-gatherer]]s <U+2014> and many, especially in [[Amazonia]], still are <U+2014> many groups practiced [[aquaculture]] and [[agriculture]]. The impact of their agricultural endowment to the world is a testament to their time and work in reshaping and cultivating the flora indigenous to the Americas.<ref name="mann">{{cite book |author=Mann, Charles C. |authorlink=Charles C.

In some regions the indigenous peoples created monumental architecture, large-scale organized cities, [[chiefdom]]s, [[State (polity)|states]], and [[empire]]s.

Many parts of the Americas are still populated by indigenous Americans; some countries have sizable populations, especially [[Belize]], [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Greenland]], [[Guatemala]], [[Mexico]], and [[Peru]]. At least a thousand different [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]] are spoken in the Americas. Some, such as [[Quechua languages]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], [[Guarani language|Guaran<U+00ED>]], [[Mayan languages]], and [[Nahuatl]], count their speakers in millions. Many also maintain aspects of indigenous cultural practices to varying degrees, including religion, [[Social organisation|social organization]], and subsistence practices. Some indigenous peoples still live in relative isolation from [[Western culture|Western]] society, and a few are still counted as [[uncontacted peoples]].

Others were contemporary with this period, and are also known from historical accounts of the time. A few, such as the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]], [[Olmec]], [[Mixtec people|Mixtec]], and [[Nahua peoples]], had their own written records. However, the European colonists of the time viewed such texts as [[heresy|heretical]], and much was destroyed in [[Christian]] [[pyre]]s. Only a few hidden documents remain today, leaving contemporary historians with glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge.

According to both indigenous American and European accounts and documents, American civilizations at the time of European encounter possessed many impressive accomplishments.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wright, Ronald |authorlink=Ronald Wright |year=2005 |title=Stolen Continents: 500 Years of Conquest and Resistance in the Americas |edition=1st Mariner Books |location=Boston, MA|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |isbn=0-618-49240-2 |oclc=57511483}}</ref> For instance, the Aztecs built one of the most impressive cities in the world, [[Tenochtitlan]], the ancient site of [[Mexico City]], with an estimated population of 200,000. American civilizations also displayed impressive accomplishments in astronomy and mathematics. Inuit, Alaskan Native, and American Indian [[creation myth]]s tell of a variety of originations of their respective peoples. Some were "always there" or were created by gods or animals, some migrated from a specified [[compass point]], and others came from "across the ocean."<ref>Richard Erdoes, Alfonso Ortiz, (Eds.)

So far, the only verifiable site of pre-Columbian European settlement anywhere in the Americas, outside of Greenland, is [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], located near the very northern tip of the Canadian island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. It was settled by the [[Norsemen|Norse]] around the end of the 10th century.

The [[European colonization of the Americas]] forever changed the lives and cultures of the peoples of the continents. Although the exact pre-contact population of the Americas is unknown, scholars estimate that Native American populations diminished by between 80 and 90% within the first centuries of contact with Europeans. The leading cause was disease. The continent was ravaged by epidemics of diseases such as [[smallpox]], [[measles]], and [[cholera]], which were brought from Europe by the early explorers and spread quickly into new areas even before later explorers and colonists reached them.  Native Americans suffered high mortality rates due to their lack of prior exposure to these diseases. The loss of lives was exacerbated by violence on the part of colonists who frequently perpetrated massacres on the indigenous groups and enslaved them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Stacie E|chapter=Native Americans|title=Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes against Humanity|editor=Dinah Shelton|publisher=Macmillan Library Reference|year=2004|pages=740<U+2013>746|ref= harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first= David E. |last=Stannard| title = American Holocaust:The Conquest of the New World: The Conquest of the New World| year= 1993| publisher = Oxford University Press, USA| isbn = 978-0-19-508557-0 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| first  = Russel | last=Thornton| title = American Indian Holocaust and Survival: <U+02DC>a Population History Since 1492| year = 1987| publisher = Norman : University of Oklahoma Press| isbn = 978-0-8061-2074-4 |ref=harv}}</ref> According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894), the North American Indian Wars of the 19th century cost the lives of about 19,000 whites and 30,000 Native Americans.<ref>Thornton, Russell (1990).

Various theories for the decline of the Native American populations emphasize epidemic diseases, conflicts with Europeans, and conflicts among [[endemic warfare|warring tribes]].

The [[Spanish Empire|Spaniards]] and other Europeans brought [[Columbian Exchange|horses to the Americas]]. Some of these animals escaped and began to breed and increase their numbers in the wild.<ref>''Ancient Horse (Equus cf.

By domesticating horses, some tribes had great success: horses enabled them to expand their territories, exchange more goods with neighboring tribes, and more easily capture [[game (food)|game]], especially bison.

Natives of North America began practicing farming approximately 4,000 years ago, late in the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] period of North American cultures. Technology had advanced to the point that pottery was becoming common and the small-scale felling of trees had become feasible.  Concurrently, the Archaic [[Native American use of fire|Indians began using fire]] in a controlled manner. Intentional burning of vegetation was used to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories.  It made travel easier and facilitated the growth of herbs and berry-producing plants, which were important for both food and medicines.<ref name="Owen2002">{{cite web|url=http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/sustain/report/terra2/terra2.htm|title=Chapter 2 (TERRA<U+2013>2): The History of Native Plant Communities in the South|last=Owen|first=Wayne|year=2002|work=Southern Forest Resource Assessment Final Report|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Southern Research Station|accessdate=29 July 2008}}</ref>

Many crops first domesticated by indigenous Americans are now produced and/or used globally. Chief among these is [[maize]] or "corn", arguably the most important crop in the world.<ref>[[Michael Pollan]], ''The Omnivore's Dilemma''</ref>  Other significant crops include [[cassava]], [[Salvia hispanica|chia]], [[squash (plant)|squash]] (pumpkins, zucchini, marrow, [[acorn squash]], [[butternut squash]]), the [[pinto bean]], ''[[Phaseolus]]'' beans including most [[common bean]]s, [[tepary bean]]s and [[lima bean]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[potato]]es, [[avocado]]s, [[peanut]]s, [[cocoa bean]]s (used to make [[chocolate]]), [[vanilla]], [[strawberries]], [[pineapple]]s, [[Capsicum|Peppers]] (species and varieties of ''[[Capsicum]]'', including [[bell pepper]]s, [[jalape<U+00F1>o]]s, [[paprika]] and [[chili pepper]]s) [[sunflower|sunflower seeds]], [[rubber]], [[brazilwood]], [[chicle]], [[tobacco]], [[coca]], [[manioc]] and some species of [[cotton]].

Studies of contemporary indigenous environmental management, including agro-forestry practices among [[Itza]] [[Maya peoples|Maya]] in Guatemala and hunting and fishing among the [[Menominee]] of Wisconsin, suggest that longstanding "sacred values" may represent a summary of sustainable millennial traditions.<ref>Atran, Scott: Medin, Douglas (2010) ''The Native Mind and the Cultural Construction of Nature'', MIT Press</ref>

== Culture ==
[[File:Quechuawomanandchild.jpg|thumb|[[Quechuas|Quechua]] woman and child in the [[Sacred Valley]], [[Andes]], [[Peru]]]]
Cultural practices in the Americas seem to have been shared mostly within geographical zones where unrelated peoples adopted similar technologies and social organizations. An example of such a [[cultural area]] is [[Mesoamerica]], where millennia of coexistence and shared development among the peoples of the region produced a fairly homogeneous culture with complex agricultural and social patterns. Another well-known example is the North American plains where until the 19th century several peoples shared the traits of [[nomad]]ic hunter-gatherers based primarily on buffalo hunting.

=== Writing systems ===
{{see also|Canadian Aboriginal syllabics|Cherokee syllabary|Quipu}}
[[File:Palenque glyphs-edit1.jpg|thumb|[[Maya script|Maya glyphs]] in stucco at the ''Museo de sitio'' in [[Palenque]], [[Mexico]]]]
The development of [[writing]] is counted among the many achievements and innovations of pre-Columbian American cultures. Independent from the development of writing in other areas of the world, the [[Mesoamerica]]n region produced several [[Mesoamerican writing systems|indigenous writing systems]] beginning in the 1st millennium BCE. What may be the earliest-known example in the Americas of an extensive text thought to be writing is by the [[Cascajal Block]]. The [[Olmec]] hieroglyphs tablet has been indirectly dated from ceramic shards found in the same context to approximately 900 BCE, around the time that Olmec occupation of [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitl<U+00E1>n]] began to wane.<ref>{{cite web |last=Skidmore|first=Joel|title= The Cascajal Block: The Earliest Precolumbian Writing|url=http://www.mesoweb.com/reports/Cascajal.pdf|year= 2006|pages= 1<U+2013>4|publisher= Mesoweb Reports & News|accessdate=14 September 2009}}</ref>

The Maya [[writing system]] (often called ''[[Maya script|hieroglyphs]]'' from a superficial resemblance to the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian writing) was a combination of [[phonetic]] symbols and [[logogram]]s. It is most often classified as a '''[[logogram|logographic]]''' or (more properly) a '''[[logosyllabic]]''' writing system, in which [[syllabary|syllabic]] signs play a significant role. It is the only pre-Columbian writing system  known to represent completely the [[spoken language]] of its community. In total, the script has more than one thousand different [[glyph]]s although a few are variations of the same sign or meaning and many appear only rarely or are confined to particular localities. At any one time, no more than about five hundred glyphs were in use, some two hundred of which (including variations) had a phonetic or syllabic interpretation.

[[Aztec codices]] (singular ''[[codex]]'') are [[book]]s written by pre-Columbian and colonial-era [[Aztec]]s. These codices provide some of the best [[primary sources]] for [[Aztec society|Aztec culture]]. The pre-Columbian codices differ from European codices in that they are largely pictorial; they were not meant to symbolize spoken or written narratives.<ref>Elizabeth Hill Boone, "Pictorial Documents and Visual Thinking in Postconquest Mexico". p. 158.</ref> The colonial era codices not only contain [[Aztec writing|Aztec pictograms]], but also [[Classical Nahuatl]] (in the [[Latin alphabet]]), [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and occasionally [[Latin]].

The [[Wiigwaasabak]], [[birch bark]] scrolls on which the [[Ojibwa]] ([[Anishinaabe]]) people wrote complex geometrical patterns and shapes, can also be considered a form of writing, as can [[Mi'kmaq hieroglyphic writing|Mi'kmaq hieroglyphics]].

Aboriginal syllabic writing, or simply '''syllabics''', is a family of [[abugida]]s used to write some Aboriginal [[Canada|Canadian]] languages of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]], [[Eskimo<U+2013>Aleut languages|Inuit]], and [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]] language families.

=== Music and art ===
{{Main|Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American music}}
[[File:Resolute Bay, Nunavut (2008) A Photo A Day (July 19, 2008).jpg|left|thumb|An [[Inukshuk]] ("Like a man") from Resolute Bay.]]
[[Native American music]] in North America is almost entirely [[Texture (music)|monophonic]], but there are notable exceptions. Traditional Native American music often centers around [[drum]]ming. [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|Rattle]]s, clappersticks, and rasps were also popular percussive instruments. [[Flute]]s were made of rivercane, cedar, and other woods. The tuning of these flutes is not precise and depends on the length of the wood used and the hand span of the intended player, but the finger holes are most often around a whole step apart and, at least in [[Northern California]], a flute was not used if it turned out to have an interval close to a half step.  The [[Apache fiddle]] is a single [[stringed instrument]].

The music of the indigenous peoples of Central Mexico and Central America was often [[pentatonic]]. Before the arrival of the Spaniards and other Europeans, music was inseparable from religious festivities and included a large variety of percussion and [[wind instrument]]s such as drums, flutes, sea snail shells (used as a trumpet) and "rain" tubes. No remnants of pre-Columbian stringed instruments were found until archaeologists discovered a jar in Guatemala, attributed to the Maya of the Late Classic Era (600<U+2013>900 CE), which depicts a stringed musical instrument which has since been reproduced. This instrument is astonishing in at least two respects. First, it is one of the very few stringed instruments known in the Americas prior to the introduction of European [[musical instrument]]s. Second, when played it produces a sound virtually identical to a jaguar's growl.<ref>A sample of this sound is available at the [http://mcis2.princeton.edu/jaguar/jaguar.html Princeton Art Museum website].</ref>

[[Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas]] comprise a major category in the world [[Collection (museum)|art collection]]. Contributions include [[Native American pottery|pottery]], [[painting]]s, [[jewellery]], [[weaving]]s, [[sculpture]]s, [[basketry]], [[Wikt:carving|carvings]], and [[beadwork]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.si.edu/DigitalCollections/BAE/Bulletin164/tptoc.htm |title="Hair Pipes in Plains Indian Adornment" by John C.

{{See also|Demographics of Argentina|Indigenous peoples in Argentina|List of indigenous languages in Argentina}}

In 2005, Argentina's indigenous population numbered about 600,329 (1.6% of total population); this figure includes 457,363 people who self-identified as belonging to an indigenous ethnic group and 142,966 who identified themselves as first-generation descendants of an indigenous people.<ref name="repetida_2"/> The ten most populous indigenous peoples are the [[Mapuche]] (113,680 people), the  [[Kolla people|Kolla]] (70,505), the [[Toba people|Toba]] (69,452), the [[Guaran<U+00ED> people|Guaran<U+00ED>]] (68,454), the [[Wich<U+00ED> people|Wichi]] (40,036), the [[Diaguita]]-[[Calchaqu<U+00ED>]] (31,753), the [[Mocov<U+00ED> people|Mocov<U+00ED>]] (15,837), the [[Huarpe]] (14,633), the [[Comeching<U+00F3>n]] (10,863) and the [[Tehuelche people|Tehuelche]] (10,590). Minor but important peoples are the [[Quechua people|Quechua]] (6,739), the [[Charr<U+00FA>a]] (4,511), the [[Pilag<U+00E1>]] (4,465), the Chan<U+00E9> (4,376), and the Chorote (2,613). The [[Selknam people|Selknam]] (Ona) people are now virtually extinct in its pure form. The languages of the Diaguita, Tehuelche, and Selknam nations have become extinct or virtually extinct: the Cac<U+00E1>n language (spoken by Diaguitas) in the 18th century and the Selknam language in the 20th century; one Tehuelche language (Southern Tehuelche) is still spoken by a handful of [[Old age|elderly people]].

=== Belize ===
Mestizos (European with indigenous peoples) number about 34 percent of the population; unmixed [[Maya peoples|Maya]] make up another 10.6 percent ([[Q'eqchi' people|Ketchi]], [[Mopan people|Mopan]], and Yucatec). The [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]], who came to Belize in the 19th century, originating from [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], with a [[Zambo|mixed]] African, [[Carib people|Carib]], and Arawak ancestry make up another 6% of the population.<ref name="celade"/>

Some groups, including [[CONAMAQ]] (the National Council of Ayllus and Markas of Qollasuyu) draw ethnic boundaries within the Quechua- and Aymara-speaking population, resulting in a total of fifty indigenous peoples native to Bolivia.

Large numbers of Bolivian highland peasants retained indigenous language, culture, customs, and communal organization throughout the Spanish conquest and the post-independence period. They mobilized to resist various attempts at the dissolution of communal landholdings and used legal recognition of "empowered caciques" to further communal organization. Indigenous revolts took place frequently until 1953.<ref>{{Cite book

That march successfully pressured the national government to sign the [[ILO Convention 169]] and to begin the still-ongoing process of recognizing and titling indigenous territories. The 1994 [[Law of Popular Participation]] granted "grassroots territorial organizations" that are recognized by the state certain rights to govern local areas.

Some radio and television programs in Quechua and Aymara are produced. The constitutional reform in 1997 recognized Bolivia as a multilingual, pluri-ethnic society and introduced [[education reform]]. In 2005, for the first time in the country's history, an indigenous Aymara, [[Evo Morales]], was elected as President.

Morales began work on his <U+201C>indigenous autonomy<U+201D> policy, which he launched in the eastern lowlands [[Departments of Bolivia|department]] on August 3, 2009, making Bolivia the first country in the history of [[South America]] to affirm the right of indigenous people to govern themselves.<ref name="Bolivian president Morales launches the <U+201C>indigenous autonomy<U+201D>"/> Speaking in [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz Department]], the President called it "a historic day for the peasant and indigenous movement", saying that, though he might make errors, he would "never betray the fight started by our ancestors and the fight of the Bolivian people".<ref name="Bolivian president Morales launches the <U+201C>indigenous autonomy<U+201D>"/> A vote on further autonomy will take place in referendums which are expected to be held in December 2009.<ref name="Bolivian president Morales launches the <U+201C>indigenous autonomy<U+201D>">{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2009/08/03/bolivian-president-morales-launches-the-indigenous-autonomy|title=Bolivian president Morales launches the "indigenous autonomy"|date=2009-08-03|accessdate=5 August 2009|publisher=[[MercoPress]]}}</ref> The issue has divided the country.<ref name="Bolivian Indians in historic step">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8180790.stm|title=Bolivian Indians in historic step|date=2009-08-03|accessdate=5 August 2009|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

According to the 2002 Census, 4.6% of the Chilean population, including the [[Rapanui]] of [[Easter Island]], was indigenous, although most show varying degrees of mixed heritage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medwave.cl/ciencia/11.act |title=El gradiente sociogen<U+00E9>tico chileno y sus implicaciones <U+00E9>tico-sociales |publisher=Medwave.cl |date=2000-06-15 |accessdate=23 May 2010}}</ref> Many are descendants of the [[Mapuche]], and live in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Araucan<U+00ED>a Region|Araucan<U+00ED>a]] and the [[Zona Sur|lake district]]. The Mapuche successfully fought off defeat in the first 300<U+2013>350 years of Spanish rule during the [[Arauco War]]. Relations with the new Chilean Republic were good until the Chilean state decided to occupy their lands. During the [[Occupation of Araucan<U+00ED>a]] the Mapuche surrendered to the country's army in the 1880s. Their land was opened to settlement by Chileans and Europeans. [[Mapuche conflict|Conflict over Mapuche land rights]] continues to the present.

Other groups include the [[Aymara people|Aymara]], the majority of whom live in Bolivia and Peru, with smaller numbers in the [[Arica-Parinacota Region|Arica-Parinacota]] and [[Tarapac<U+00E1> Region]]s, and the [[Alacalufe people]], who reside mainly in [[Puerto Ed<U+00E9>n]].

A minority today within [[Colombia]]'s overwhelmingly [[Mestizo]] and [[Afro-Colombian]] population, Colombia's indigenous peoples nonetheless encompass at least 85 distinct cultures and more than 1,378,884 people.<ref>DANE 2005 national census</ref><ref>[http://www.who.int/social_determinants/resources/isa_etnic_minorities_col.pdf "Health equity and ethnic minorities in emergency situations"], Pier Paolo Balladelli, Jos<U+00E9> Milton Guzm<U+00E1>n, Marcelo Korc, Paula Moreno, Gabriel Rivera, The Commission on Social Health Determinants, [[Pan American Health Organization]], [[World Health Organization]], [[Bogot<U+00E1>|Bogot<U+00E1>, Colombia]], 2007</ref> A variety of [[collective rights]] for indigenous peoples are recognized in the 1991 Constitution.

One of these is the [[Muisca]] culture, a subset of the larger [[Chibcha]] [[ethnic group]], famous for their use of [[gold]], which led to the legend of [[El Dorado]]. At the time of the [[Spanish conquest]], the Chibchas were the largest native civilization between the [[Incas]] and the [[Aztec]]s.

=== Costa Rica ===
{{Main|Indigenous peoples of Costa Rica}}
There are over 60,000 inhabitants of Native American origins, representing 1.5% of the population. Most of them live in secluded reservations, distributed among eight ethnic groups: Quitirris<U+00ED> (In the Central Valley), Matamb<U+00FA> or [[Chorotega]] (Guanacaste), [[Maleku people|Maleku]] (Northern Alajuela), [[Bribri people|Bribri]] (Southern Atlantic), Cab<U+00E9>car (Cordillera de Talamanca), [[Guaym<U+00ED>]] (Southern Costa Rica, along the Panam<U+00E1> border), [[Boruca people|Boruca]] (Southern Costa Rica) and [[T<U+00E9>rraba]] (Southern Costa Rica).

These native groups are characterized for their work in wood, like masks, drums and other artistic figures, as well as fabrics made of cotton.

Their subsistence is based on agriculture, having corn, beans and plantains as the main crops.

=== Cuba ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
In [[Cuba]] the [[population]] of Native Americans includes 0.1 of the population and 0.2 part Native which is also part of the population.  Many are from the [[Taino people]] or [[Arawak people]]. When the [[Spanish Empire]] was in control of the island they used the Natives as slaves but many died from diseases, hence decreasing the population. Presently 0.3 of the population of [[Cuba]] consists of part Native and full-blooded Native Americans.

=== Ecuador ===
{{Main|Indigenous peoples in Ecuador}}
[[File:EquateurOtavalo 0606.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Otavalo people|Otavalo]] girl from Ecuador]]
[[Ecuador]] was the site of many indigenous cultures, and civilizations of different proportions. An early sedentary culture, known as the [[Valdivia culture]], developed in the coastal region, while the [[Caras (tribe)|Caras]] and the [[Quitu]]s unified to form an elaborate civilization that ended at the birth of the Capital Quito. The [[Ca<U+00F1>ari]]s near [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]] were the most advanced, and most feared by the [[Inca]], due to their fierce resistance to the Incan expansion. Their architecture remains were later destroyed by Spaniards and the Incas.

Approximately 96.4% of Ecuador's Indigenous population are Highland Quichuas living in the valleys of the Sierra region. Primarily consisting of the descendents of Incans, they are [[Kichwa]] speakers and include the Caranqui, the [[Otavalo people|Otavalo]]s, the Cayambi, the Quitu-Caras, the [[Panzaleo]], the Chimbuelo, the Salasacan, the Tugua, the Puruh<U+00E1>, the [[Ca<U+00F1>ari]], and the Saraguro. Linguistic evidence suggests that the Salascan and the Saraguro may have been the descendants of Bolivian ethnic groups transplanted to Ecuador as ''mitimaes''.

Coastal groups, including the [[Aw<U+00E1> (kwaiker)|Aw<U+00E1>]], [[Ecuador|Chachi]], and the [[Ts<U+00E1>chila]], make up 0.24% percent of the indigenous population, while the remaining 3.35 percent live in the Oriente and consist of the Oriente Kichwa (the Canelo and the Quijos), the [[Shuar people|Shuar]], the [[Huaorani]], the Siona-Secoya, the [[Cof<U+00E1>n]], and the [[Achuar people|Achuar]].

In 1986, indigenous people formed the first "truly" national [[Political organisation|political organization]].  [[CONAIE|The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador]] ([[CONAIE]]) has been the primary political institution of the Indigenous since then and is now the second largest political party in the nation.  It has been influential in national politics, contributing to the ouster of  presidents [[Abdal<U+00E1> Bucaram]] in 1997 and [[Jamil Mahuad]] in 2000.

=== El Salvador ===

[[File:Nuestros Angeles de El Salvador.jpg|thumb|Indigenous Salvadoran [[Pipil people|Pipil]] women dancing in the traditional Procession of Palms, [[Panchimalco]] in [[El Salvador]]]]
Much of [[El Salvador]] was home to the [[Pipil people|Pipil]], the [[Lenca people|Lenca]], Xinca, and Kakawira. The Pipil lived in western [[El Salvador]], spoke [[Nahuat|Nawat]], and had many settlements there, most noticeably the [[Se<U+00F1>or<U+00ED>o of Cuzcatl<U+00E1>n]]. The Pipil had no precious mineral resources, but they did have rich and [[fertile soil|fertile land]] that was good for farming. The Spaniards were disappointed not to find gold or jewels in [[El Salvador]] as they had in other lands like [[Guatemala]] or [[Mexico]], but upon learning of the fertile land in El Salvador, they attempted to conquer it. Noted Meso-American indigenous warriors to rise militarily against the Spanish included Princes Atonal and Atlacatl of the Pipil people in central El Salvador and Princess Antu Silan Ulap of the Lenca people in eastern El Salvador, who saw the Spanish not as gods but as barbaric invaders. After fierce battles, the Pipil successfully fought off the Spanish army led by [[Pedro de Alvarado]] along with their Mexican Indian allies (the Tlaxcalas), sending them back to Guatemala. After many other attacks with an army reinforced with Guatemalan Indian allies, the Spanish were able to conquer Cuzcatl<U+00E1>n. After further attacks, the Spanish also conquered the Lenca people. Eventually, the Spaniards intermarried with Pipil and Lenca women, resulting in the Mestizo population which would become the majority of the Salvadoran people. Today many Pipil and other indigenous populations live in the many small towns of El Salvador like [[Izalco]], [[Panchimalco]], [[Sacacoyo]], and [[Nahuizalco]].

=== Guatemala ===

[[File:Guat<U+00E9>mala 78.jpg|thumb|left|Maya women from Guatemala]]
Many of the indigenous peoples of [[Guatemala]] are of [[Maya peoples|Maya]] heritage. Other groups are [[Xinca people]] and [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]].

Pure Maya account for some 40 percent of the population; although around 40 percent of the population speaks an [[indigenous language]], those tongues (of which there are more than 20) enjoy no official status. Guatemala's majority population holds a percentage of 59.4% in [[White]] or [[Mestizo]] (of mixed European and indigenous ancestry) people. The area of [[Livingston, Guatemala]] is highly influenced by the Caribbean and its population includes a combination of Mestizos and Garifuna people.

=== Honduras ===
About 5 percent of the population are of full-blooded indigenous descent, but upwards to 80 percent more or the majority of Hondurans are mestizo or part-indigenous with European admixture, and about 10 percent are of indigenous and/or African descent.<ref name=Miskitu>{{cite journal|title=The Miskitu of Nicaragua: Politicized Ethnicity|first=Philippe |last=Bourgois |jstor=3033029 |publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|date=Anthropology Today, Vol. 2, No. 2 (Apr., 1986), pp. 4-9 }}</ref> The main concentration of indigenous in [[Honduras]] are in the rural westernmost areas facing Guatemala and to [[Caribbean Sea|the Caribbean Sea]] coastline, as well on the Nicaraguan border.<ref name=Miskitu/> The majority of indigenous people are [[Lenca people|Lencas]], [[Miskito people|Miskitos]] to the east, [[Maya peoples|Mayans]], [[Pech people|Pech]], [[Sumo people|Sumos]], and [[Tolupan people|Tolupan]].<ref name=Miskitu/>

The territory of modern-day [[Mexico]] was home to numerous indigenous civilizations prior to the arrival of the Spanish ''[[conquistador]]es'': The [[Olmec]]s, who flourished from between 1200 BCE to about 400 BCE in the coastal regions of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]; the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]] and the [[Mixtec]]s, who held sway in the mountains of [[Oaxaca]] and the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]]; the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] in the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n]] (and into neighbouring areas of contemporary [[Central America]]); the [[P'urh<U+00E9>pecha]] or [[Tarascan state|Tarascan]] in present day [[Michoac<U+00E1>n]] and surrounding areas, and the [[Aztec]]s/[[Mexica]], who, from their central capital at [[Tenochtitlan]], dominated much of the centre and south of the country (and the non-Aztec inhabitants of those areas) when [[Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s]] first landed at [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]].

In contrast to what was the general rule in the rest of North America, the history of the colony of [[New Spain]] was one of racial intermingling (''mestizaje''). ''[[Mestizo]]s'' quickly came to account for a majority of the colony's population; however, significant numbers and communities of ''ind<U+00ED>genas'' (as the native peoples are now known) survive to the present day. The [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples|CDI]] identifies 62 indigenous groups in Mexico, each with a unique language.<ref>[http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/257.pdf Ley General de Derechos Ling<U+00FC><U+00ED>sticos de los Pueblos Ind<U+00ED>genas] (PDF).</ref>

In the states of [[Chiapas]] and [[Oaxaca]] and in the interior of the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n]] peninsula the majority of the population is indigenous.  Large indigenous minorities, including [[Aztecs]] or [[Nahua people|Nahua]], [[P'urh<U+00E9>pecha]]s, [[Mazahua]], [[Otomi people|Otomi]], and [[Mixtec]]s are also present in the central regions of Mexico. In Northern Mexico indigenous people are a small minority.

=== Nicaragua ===
{{Main|Miskito people}}
The '''Miskito''' are a native people in [[Central America]]. Their territory extended from [[Cape Camar<U+00F3>n]], [[Honduras]], to [[La Cruz de R<U+00ED>o Grande|Rio Grande]], [[Nicaragua]] along the [[Mosquito Coast]]. There is a native [[Miskito language]], but large groups speak [[Miskito Coast Creole]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Rama language|Rama]] and other languages. The [[English-based creole languages|Creole English]] came about through frequent contact with the British who colonized the area. Many are Christians.

Traditional Miskito [[society]] was highly structured with a defined [[politics|political]] structure. There was a [[monarch|king]], but he did not have total power. Instead, the power was split between himself, a [[Miskito Governor|governor]], a [[Miskito General|general]], and by the 1750s, an [[Miskito Admiral|admiral]]. Historical information on kings is often obscured by the fact that many of the kings were semi-[[mythology|mythical]].

Other indigenous groups in Nicaragua are located in the Central and Northern Pacific area and they are self-identified as follows: [[Chorotega]], [[Cacaopera]], Xiu-Sutiaba and Nahoa.<ref>[http://www.pueblosindigenaspcn.net/component/content/article/84.html Caracter<U+0102><U+00AD>sticas Socioculturales de los Pueblos Ind<U+0102><U+00AD>genas del Pac<U+0102><U+00AD>fico, Centro y Norte].

Indigenous peoples in what is now the [[Continental United States|contiguous United States]], including their descendants, are commonly called "Amerindian", "American Indians", or simply "Indians" domestically, but are officially referred to as "Native Americans" by the [[United States Census Bureau|USCB]]. In Alaska, indigenous peoples, which include [[Athabaskan languages|Athabascan]], [[Aleut people|Aleut]], [[Alutiiq people|Alutiiq]], [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik people|Cup'ik]], [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Inuit]], [[Inupiat people|I<U+00F1>upiat]], [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], and [[Yupik peoples|Yup'ik]], are referred to collectively as [[Alaska Natives]]. In Hawaii, indigenous [[Polynesia|Polynesian peoples]], which include [[Marshallese people|Marshallese]], [[Samoan people|Samoan]], [[Tahitian people|Tahitian]], and [[Tongan peoples|Tongan]], are referred to collectively as [[Native Hawaiians]].

Native Americans in the United States make up 2 percent of the population.

A minority of U.S. Native Americans live in land units called [[Indian reservation]]s. Some southwestern U.S. tribes, such as the [[Kumeyaay]], [[Cocopa]], [[Pascua Yaqui]] and [[Apache]] span both sides of the US<U+2013>Mexican border.

=== Venezuela ===
{{main|Indigenous peoples in Venezuela}}
Most [[Venezuela]]ns have some indigenous heritage, but the indigenous population make up only around 2% of the total population. They speak around 29 different languages and many more dialects, but some of the ethnic groups are very small and their languages are in danger of becoming extinct in the next decades. The most important indigenous groups are the [[Ye'kuana]], the [[Wayuu]], the [[Pemon]] and the [[Warao people|Warao]]. The most advanced native people to have lived in present-day Venezuela is thought to have been the [[Timoto-cuicas]], who mainly lived in the Venezuelan Andes. In total it is estimated that there were between 350 thousand and 500 thousand inhabitants, the most densely populated area being the Andean region (Timoto-cuicas), thanks to the advanced agricultural techniques used.

The 1999 [[constitution of Venezuela]] gives them [[special rights]], although the vast majority of them still live in very critical conditions of poverty. The largest groups receive some basic [[primary education]] in their languages.

=== Other parts of the Americas ===
Indigenous peoples make up the majority of the population in [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]], and are a significant element in most other former [[Spain|Spanish]] colonies. Exceptions to this include [[Uruguay]] ([[Charrua|Native Charr<U+00FA>a]]). At least four of the native American languages ([[Quechua language|Quechua]] in Peru and Bolivia; [[Aymara language|Aymara]] also in Peru and [[Bolivia]], [[Guarani language|Guaran<U+00ED>]] in [[Paraguay]], and [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] in [[Greenland]]) are recognized as official languages.

== Native American name controversy ==
{{Main|Native American name controversy}}

The '''Native American name controversy''' is an ongoing dispute over the acceptable ways to refer to the indigenous peoples of the Americas and to broad subsets thereof, such as those living in a specific country or sharing certain cultural attributes. Once-common terms like "Indian" remain in use, despite the introduction of [[Geopolitics|geopolitically]] correct terms such as "Indian American", "Native American" and "Amerindian" during the latter half of the 20th century.<ref>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language.

== Rise of indigenous movements ==
{{Indigenous rights}}
In recent years, there has been a rise of indigenous movements in the Americas (mainly South America). These are rights-driven groups that organize themselves in order to achieve some sort of [[self-determination]] and the preservation of their culture for their peoples. Organizations like the [[Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin]] and the Indian Council of South America are examples of movements that are breaking the barrier of borders in order to obtain rights for [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] indigenous populations everywhere. Similar movements for indigenous rights can also be seen in Canada and the United States, with movements like the [[International Indian Treaty Council]] and the accession of native Indian group into the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]].

There has also been a recognition of indigenous movements on an international scale, with the [[United Nations]] adopting the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]], despite dissent from the stronger countries of the Americas.

In Colombia, various indigenous groups protested the denial of their rights.  People organized a march in [[Cali]] in October 2008 to demand the government live up to promises to protect indigenous lands, defend the indigenous against violence, and reconsider the [[free trade]] pact with the United States.<ref>[http://africa.reuters.com/world/news/usnTRE49M10G.html Africa.euters.com]{{Dead link|date=May 2009}}</ref>

[[File:Evomorales-cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Evo Morales]] ([[Aymara people|Aymara]]), [[President of Bolivia]]]]

The first indigenous president to be democratically elected in Latin America was [[Benito Juarez]], a Mexican of the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] ethnic group, who was elected President of Mexico in 1858.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harten|first=Sven|title=The Rise of Evo Morales|year=2011|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-84813-523-9|url=http://www.amazon.com/The-Rise-Evo-Morales-MAS/dp/1848135238/ref=dp_return_1?ie=UTF8&n=283155&s=books}}</ref>

With the rise to power of governments in [[Hugo Chavez's foreign policy#Vatican|Venezuela]], Ecuador, Paraguay, and especially Bolivia where [[Evo Morales]] was the first indigenous descendant elected [[president of Bolivia]], the indigenous movement gained a strong foothold.

Representatives from indigenous and rural organizations from major South American countries, including Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Chile and Brazil, started a forum in support of Morales' legal process of change. The meeting condemned plans by the European "foreign [[power elite]]" to destabilize the country. The forum also expressed solidarity with the Morales and his economic and social changes in the interest of historically marginalized majorities. Furthermore, in a cathartic blow to the US-backed elite, it questioned US interference through diplomats and NGOs. The forum was suspicious of plots against Bolivia and other countries, including Cuba, Venezuela, Ecuador, Paraguay and [[Nicaragua]].<ref name="plenglish">[http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B59DF5FFB-B4C1-4E06-B315-BA3A23C1F081%7D)&language=EN Plenglish.com]{{Dead link|date=May 2009}}</ref>

The forum rejected the supposed violent method used by regional civic leaders from the called "Crescent departments" in Bolivia to impose their autonomous statutes, applauded the decision to expel the US ambassador to Bolivia, and reaffirmed the sovereignty and independence of the presidency.  Amongst others, representatives of [[CONAIE]], the [[National Indigenous Organization of Colombia]], the Chilean Council of All Lands, and the Brazilian Landless Movement participated in the forum.<ref name="plenglish"/>

The initial peopling of Berinigia (depicted in light yellow) was followed by a standstill after which the ancestors of indigenous Americans spread swiftly all over the New World while some of the Beringian maternal lineages<U+2013>C1a-spread westwards.

"Y-DNA" is passed solely along the [[patrilineal]] line, from father to son, while "mtDNA" is passed down the [[matrilineal]] line, from mother to offspring of both sexes.
