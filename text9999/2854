The first pharmaceutical amphetamine was [[Benzedrine]], a brand of inhalers used to treat a variety of conditions.  Currently, pharmaceutical amphetamine is typically prescribed as [[Adderall]],{{#tag:ref|"Adderall" is a [[brand name]] as opposed to a nonproprietary name; because the latter ("''dextroamphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine aspartate''"<ref name="NDCD">{{cite web | title = National Drug Code Amphetamine Search Results | url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ndc/results.cfm?beginrow=1&numberperpage=160&searchfield=amphetamine&searchtype=ActiveIngredient&OrderBy=ProprietaryName | work = National Drug Code Directory|publisher=United States Food and Drug Administration | accessdate = 16 December 2013 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20131216080856/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ndc/results.cfm?beginrow=1&numberperpage=160&searchfield=amphetamine&searchtype=ActiveIngredient&OrderBy=ProprietaryName | archivedate = 7 February 2014}}</ref>) is excessively long, this article exclusively refers to this amphetamine mixture by the brand name.|name="Adderall"| group="note"}} dextroamphetamine, or the inactive [[prodrug]] [[lisdexamfetamine]]. Amphetamine, through activation of a [[TAAR1|trace amine receptor]], increases [[biogenic amine]] and [[Neurotransmitter#Excitatory and inhibitory|excitatory neurotransmitter]] activity in the brain, with its most pronounced effects targeting the [[catecholamine]] neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine. At therapeutic doses, this causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in libido, increased wakefulness, and improved [[cognitive control]]. It induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength.{{#tag:ref|<ref name="Adderall IR" /><ref name="Ergogenics" /><ref name="Malenka_2009" /><ref name="Libido" /><ref name="Amph Uses" /><ref name="Benzedrine" /><ref name="Miller" /><ref name="FDA Effects" />|group="sources"}}

Much larger doses of amphetamine are likely to impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. [[Addiction|Drug addiction]] is a serious risk with large recreational doses, but rarely arises from medical use. Very high doses can result in [[Stimulant psychosis#Amphetamines|psychosis]] (e.g., delusions and paranoia) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of serious side effects.{{#tag:ref|<ref name="FDA Abuse & OD" /><ref name="Malenka_2009" /><ref name="Cochrane" /><ref name="Stimulant Misuse" /><ref name="EncycOfPsychopharm" /><ref name="Westfall" />|group="sources"}}

Amphetamine is also the parent compound of its own structural class, the [[substituted amphetamine]]s,{{#tag:ref|Due to confusion that may arise from use of the plural form, this article will only use the terms "amphetamine" and "amphetamines" to refer to racemic amphetamine, levoamphetamine, and dextroamphetamine and reserve the term "substituted amphetamines" for the class.|group="note"}} which includes prominent substances such as [[bupropion]], [[cathinone]], [[MDMA|MDMA (ecstasy)]], and [[methamphetamine]]. As a member of the phenethylamine class, amphetamine is also chemically related to the naturally occurring [[trace amine]] neuromodulators, specifically [[phenethylamine]]{{#tag:ref|Again, due to confusion that may arise from use of the plural form, this article will only use "phenethylamine" and "phenethylamines" to refer to the compound itself and reserve the term "substituted phenethylamines" for the class.|group="note"}} and {{nowrap|[[N-methylphenethylamine|''N''-methylphenethylamine]]}}, both of which are produced within the human body. Phenethylamine is the parent compound of amphetamine, while ''N''-methylphenethylamine is a [[constitutional isomer]] that differs only in the placement of the methyl group.{{#tag:ref|<ref name="EMC">{{cite web | title = Amphetamine | url = http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/amphetamine | work = European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction | accessdate = 19 October 2013}}</ref><ref name="Trace Amines" />|group="sources"}}

Over the past two decades, research has progressed from identifying <U+0394>FosB induction to investigating its subsequent action (38). It is likely that <U+0394>FosB research will now progress into a new era <U+2013> the use of <U+0394>FosB as a biomarker. If <U+0394>FosB detection is indicative of chronic drug exposure (and is at least partly responsible for dependence of the substance), then its monitoring for therapeutic efficacy in interventional studies is a suitable biomarker (Figure 2). Examples of therapeutic avenues are discussed herein.&nbsp;...<br />Conclusions<br /><U+0394>FosB is an essential transcription factor implicated in the molecular and behavioral pathways of addiction following repeated drug exposure. The formation of <U+0394>FosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for <U+0394>FosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of <U+0394>FosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of <U+0394>FosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a <U+2018><U+2018>molecular switch<U+2019><U+2019> (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of <U+0394>FosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.}}</ref> While there are currently no effective drugs for treating amphetamine addiction, regularly engaging in sustained aerobic exercise appears to reduce the risk of developing such an addiction.<ref name="Running vs addiction" /> Sustained aerobic exercise on a regular basis also appears to be an effective treatment for amphetamine addiction;<ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /><ref name="Running vs addiction" /> exercise therapy improves [[wikt:clinical|clinical]] treatment outcomes and may be used as a [[combination therapy]] with [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], which is currently the best clinical treatment available.<ref name="Running vs addiction" /><ref name="Nestler CBT"/>

Moreover, sexual experience induces neural plasticity in the NAc similar to that induced by psychostimulant exposure, including increased dendritic spine density (Meisel and Mullins, 2006; Pitchers et al., 2010a), altered glutamate receptor trafficking, and decreased synaptic strength in prefrontal cortex-responding NAc shell neurons (Pitchers et al., 2012). Finally, periods of abstinence from sexual experience were found to be critical for enhanced Amph reward, NAc spinogenesis (Pitchers et al., 2010a), and glutamate receptor trafficking (Pitchers et al., 2012).

Although few clinical studies have investigated the efficacy of exercise for preventing relapse, the few studies that have been conducted generally report a reduction in drug craving and better treatment outcomes (see Table 4).&nbsp;...

Many types of substances are known to [[drug interaction|interact]] with amphetamine, resulting in altered [[drug action]] or [[Drug metabolism|metabolism]] of amphetamine, the interacting substance, or both.<ref name="FDA Pharmacokinetics" /><ref name="FDA Interactions" />  Inhibitors of the enzymes that metabolize amphetamine (i.e., CYP2D6 and flavin-containing monooxygenase 3) will prolong its [[elimination half-life]], meaning that its effects will last longer.<ref name="FMO" /><ref name="FDA Interactions">{{cite web | title = Adderall XR Prescribing Information | url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/021303s026lbl.pdf | pages = 8<U+2013>10 | publisher = Shire US Inc | work = United States Food and Drug Administration |date=December 2013 | accessdate = 30 December 2013 }}</ref>  Amphetamine also interacts with {{abbr|MAOIs|monoamine oxidase inhibitors}}, particularly [[monoamine oxidase A]] inhibitors, since both MAOIs and amphetamine increase plasma catecholamines (i.e., norepinephrine and dopamine);<ref name="FDA Interactions" /> therefore, concurrent use of both is dangerous.<ref name="FDA Interactions" />  Amphetamine will modulate the activity of most psychoactive drugs.  In particular, amphetamine may decrease the effects of [[sedative]]s and [[depressant]]s and increase the effects of [[stimulant]]s and [[antidepressant]]s.<ref name="FDA Interactions" />  Amphetamine may also decrease the effects of [[antihypertensives]] and [[antipsychotic]]s due to its effects on blood pressure and dopamine respectively.<ref name="FDA Interactions" />  In general, there is no significant interaction when consuming amphetamine with food, but the [[pH]] of gastrointestinal content and urine affects the absorption and excretion of amphetamine, respectively.<ref name="FDA Interactions" />  Acidic substances reduce the absorption of amphetamine and increase urinary excretion, and alkaline substances do the opposite.<ref name="FDA Interactions" />  Due to the effect pH has on absorption, amphetamine also interacts with gastric acid reducers such as [[proton pump inhibitor]]s and [[H2 antagonist|H<sub>2</sub> antihistamines]], which increase gastrointestinal pH (i.e., make it less acidic).<ref name="FDA Interactions" />

Amphetamine has no direct effect on [[acetylcholine]] neurotransmission, but several studies have noted that acetylcholine release increases after its use.<ref name="Acetylcholine" /><ref name="MEDRS-Cholinergic" /> In lab animals, amphetamine increases acetylcholine levels in certain brain regions as a downstream effect.<ref name="Acetylcholine" />  In humans, a similar phenomenon occurs via the [[ghrelin]]-mediated [[cholinergic<U+2013>dopaminergic reward link]] in the [[ventral tegmental area]].<ref name="MEDRS-Cholinergic" /> This heightened [[cholinergic]] activity leads to increased [[nicotinic receptor]] activation in the {{abbr|CNS|central nervous system}}, a factor which likely contributes to the [[nootropic]] effects of amphetamine.<ref name="pmid21334367">{{cite journal | author = Levin ED, Bushnell PJ, Rezvani AH | title = Attention-modulating effects of cognitive enhancers | journal = Pharmacol.

Extracellular levels of [[glutamate]], the primary [[Neurotransmitter#Excitatory and inhibitory|excitatory neurotransmitter]] in the brain, have been shown to increase upon exposure to amphetamine.<ref name="glutamate1" /><ref name="glutamate2" />  This [[cotransmission]] effect was found in the mesolimbic pathway, an area of the brain implicated in reward, where amphetamine is known to affect dopamine neurotransmission.<ref name="glutamate1" /><ref name="glutamate2" />  Amphetamine also induces effluxion of [[histamine]] from synaptic vesicles in {{abbr|CNS|central nervous system}} [[mast cell]]s and histaminergic neurons through {{abbr|VMAT2|vesicular monoamine transporter 2}}.<ref name="E Weihe" />

===Pharmacokinetics===

The oral [[bioavailability]] of amphetamine varies with gastrointestinal pH;<ref name="FDA Interactions" /> it is well absorbed from the gut, and bioavailability is typically over&nbsp;75% for dextroamphetamine.<ref name="Drugbank-dexamph" /> Amphetamine is a weak base with a [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa]] of {{nowrap|9<U+2013>10}};<ref name="FDA Pharmacokinetics" /> consequently, when the pH is basic, more of the drug is in its [[lipid]] soluble [[free base]] form, and more is absorbed through the lipid-rich [[cell membranes]] of the gut [[epithelium]].<ref name="FDA Pharmacokinetics" /><ref name="FDA Interactions" /> Conversely, an acidic pH means the drug is predominantly in a water soluble [[cation]]ic (salt) form, and less is absorbed.<ref name="FDA Pharmacokinetics" /> Approximately {{nowrap|15<U+2013>40%}} of amphetamine circulating in the bloodstream is bound to [[plasma protein]]s.<ref name="Drugbank-amph" />

A significant number of amphetamine syntheses feature a [[Organic redox reaction#Organic reductions|reduction]] of a [[nitro group|nitro]], [[imine]], [[oxime]] or other nitrogen-containing [[functional group]].<ref name = "Allen_Cantrell_1989"/>  In one such example, a [[Knoevenagel condensation]] of [[benzaldehyde]] with [[nitroethane]] yields {{nowrap|[[phenyl-2-nitropropene]]}}.
