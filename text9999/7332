'''''Persoonia lanceolata''''', commonly known as '''lance-leaf geebung''',  is a shrub native to [[New South Wales]] in eastern Australia.  It reaches {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height and has smooth grey bark and bright green foliage. Its small yellow flowers grow on [[raceme]]s and appear in the austral summer and autumn (January to April), followed by green fleshy fruit (known as [[drupe]]s) which ripen the following spring (September to October). Within the genus ''[[Persoonia]]'', ''Persoonia lanceolata'' belongs to the lanceolata group of 58 closely related species.  It interbreeds with several other species found in its range.

The species is usually found in dry [[sclerophyll]] forest on [[sandstone]]-based nutrient-deficient soil. It has adapted to a fire-prone environment; plants lost in bushfires can regenerate through a ground-stored [[seed bank]]. Seedlings mostly germinate within two years of fires. Several species of native bee of the genus ''[[Leioproctus]]'' pollinate the flowers. [[Swamp Wallaby|Swamp wallabies]] are a main consumer of its fruit, and the seeds are spread in wallaby [[feces|scat]]. Its lifespan ranges from 25 to 60 years, though difficulties in propagation have seen low cultivation rates.

''Persoonia lanceolata'' is a shrub which ranges from {{convert|0.5|<U+2013>|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. The grey bark is smooth, and the new growth is hairy.

Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical [[Petal#Corolla|perianth]] which splits into four segments or [[tepal]]s, and contains both male and female parts.

The firm bark and lanceolate leaves of ''P.&nbsp;lanceolata'' distinguish it from ''P.&nbsp;levis'', with which it can be confused; the latter species has flaky bark and asymmetrical leaves.<ref name=Fairley/>

==Distribution and habitat==
''Persoonia lanceolata'' is found along coastal and near-coastal areas of [[New South Wales]] east of the [[Great Dividing Range]], from [[Trial Bay]] on the [[Mid North Coast (New South Wales)|Mid North Coast]] to Sassafras [[Morton National Park]] in the south. Its habitat extends to dry [[sclerophyll]] forest and heathland on [[sandstone]]-based soils low in nutrients,<ref name=FoA/> particularly on the tops of ridges and slopes.<ref name=Benson2000/> Examples in more sheltered areas are often taller than those in more exposed areas.<ref name=LCNP/> ''P.&nbsp;lanceolata'' is found from sea level to an altitude of {{convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the annual rainfall of the area it occurs in the Sydney Basin<!--wot; The annual rainfall in the Sidney Basin?--> is {{convert|900|<U+2013>|1400|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Benson2000/> The species is considered adequately protected in the Sydney region, and is found in [[Bouddi National Park|Bouddi]], [[Brisbane Water National Park|Brisbane Water]], [[Marramarra National Park|Marramarra]], Ku-ring-gai Chase, Lane Cove, [[Sydney Harbour National Park|Sydney Harbour]] and [[Botany Bay National Park]]s.<ref name=Benson2000/> In heathland habitats, ''P.&nbsp;lanceolata'' grows with such species as ''[[Banksia ericifolia]]'', ''[[Banksia oblongifolia|B.&nbsp;oblongifolia]]'' and ''[[Darwinia fascicularis]]''. In more forested areas it is an [[understory]] shrub alongside ''[[Lambertia formosa]]'', ''[[Leptospermum trinervium]]'', ''[[Daviesia corymbosa]]'', ''[[Banksia serrata]]'' and ''B.&nbsp;ericifolia'' under such trees as ''[[Eucalyptus sclerophylla]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus piperita|E.&nbsp;piperita]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus sieberi|E.&nbsp;sieberi]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus sparsifolia|E.&nbsp;sparsifolia]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus punctata|E.&nbsp;punctata]]'' and ''[[Corymbia gummifera]]''.<ref name=Benson2000/>

==Ecology==
[[File:PerslancNGH.jpg|thumb|right|developing drupes, Nannygoat Hill ([[Earlwood, New South Wales|Earlwood]])]]
The [[Swamp Wallaby|swamp wallaby]] (''Wallabia bicolor'') feeds on the fallen fruit of ''P.&nbsp;lanceolata'' and disperses the seed through its [[feces|scat]] (dung). A<!--year please. A 1400 BC study by the hoar Clypos....--> field study in [[Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park]] found that 88% of seeds in the scat were still viable although dormant.<ref name=auld>{{cite journal|title=Dispersal and recruitment dynamics in the fleshy-fruited ''Persoonia lanceolata'' (Proteaceae) |year=2007|journal=Journal of Vegetation Science| volume=18|issue=6|pages=903<U+2013>10|author=Auld, Tony D.; Denham, Andrew J.; Turner, Ken |doi=10.1111/j.1654-1103.2007.tb02606.x}}</ref> The [[Red-necked Wallaby|red-necked wallaby]] (''Macropus rufogriseus'') feeds on drupes and is a likely seed dispersal agent. Animals can convey seed for one or two kilometres from where they have fed. Rodents such as the [[Bush Rat|bush rat]] (''Rattus fuscipes'') and [[black rat]] (''Rattus rattus'') eat the drupes but chew the seed so that only fragments leave their digestive system.<ref name=Rymer06/><!-- cites previous three sentences --> [[Red Fox|Foxes]] have been reported to eat the fruit, and [[kangaroo]]s and large birds such as [[currawong]]s are thought to as well.<ref name=Benson2000/>

[[Colletidae|Colletid]] bees of the genus ''[[Leioproctus]]'' subgenus ''[[Cladocerapis]]'' forage exclusively on and pollinate flowers of many species of ''Persoonia''. Bees of the subgenus ''[[Filiglossa]]'' in the same genus also feed only on ''Persoonia'' flowers but do not appear to be effective pollinators.<ref name=weston03/> Recorded species include the longtongue bees ''[[Leioproctus carinatifrons|Leioproctus (Cladocerapis) carinatifrons]]'', ''[[Leioproctus incanescens|L.&nbsp;incanescens]]'', and ''[[Leioproctus speculiferus|L.&nbsp;speculiferus]]'', as well as ''[[Leioproctus filamentosa]]'' and ''[[Exoneura]]'' species.<ref name=Benson2000/> The [[Apis mellifera|European honeybee]] (''Apis mellifera'') is a common visitor to flowers, although its effectiveness as a pollinator is unclear. ''Persoonia lanceolata'' is an obligate outcrosser, that is, flowers need to be pollinated by pollen from other plants, and honeybees tend to forage more on different flowers of the same plant than between plants, as native bees do. Their abundance might be impacting on the pollination success of native bees in this and other ''Persoonia'' species.<ref name=Rymer05>{{cite journal|journal =Biological Conservation|title=Reproductive success and pollinator effectiveness differ in common and rare ''Persoonia'' species (Proteaceae)|volume=123|year=2005|author=Rymer, Paul D.;  Whelan, Robert J.; Ayre, David J.; Weston, Peter H.; Russell, Kenneth G. |url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/pls/portallive/docs/1/42749696.PDF |pages=521<U+2013>32}}</ref> <!-- cites previous four sentences -->

Examples destroyed by [[bushfire]] regenerate through seedlings surviving through seedbank in the soil. The Ku-ring-gai Chase study found that seedlings germinated within two years of a 1994 bushfire, although some appeared up to six years afterwards, while germination was not related to any particular season. Plants take six years to reach maturity. Thus, more frequent bushfires prevent recruitment and hence endanger populations.<ref name=auld/> However, plants in [[Lane Cove National Park]] were recorded maturing three years after an especially intense bushfire. What triggers germination is unknown, and seedlings have also arisen from areas disturbed by [[sand mining]], sometimes growing in higher concentrations than before the disturbance. The natural lifespan of a plant appears to range from 25 to 60 years.<ref name=Benson2000/><!-- cites previous three sentences -->

==Cultivation==
''Persoonia lanceolata'' is rarely seen in cultivation, mainly due to difficulties in [[Plant propagation|propagation]]; seed germination is unpredictable, and [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] have proven difficult to strike. Nevertheless, its bright green hue is considered an attractive horticultural feature. Well drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for this plant in a garden setting.<ref name = "Wrigley 1991"/> Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells, and grows fairly readily in suitable conditions. Plantsmen in England were able to germinate seed there in 1791.<ref name=EJ97/><!-- cites previous two sentences -->
