==History==

According to [[F. Curta]], the book was "certainly of Macedonian origin", written "either in Ohrid or in one of the monastic centers in the region."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.bg/books?id=YIAYMNOOe0YC&pg=PA285|title=Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500-1250|author=Florin Curta|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|ISBN=0521815398|page=285|quote=Although one of them was found in the Monastery of the Holy Mother of God on Mount Athos (hence its name, Codex Marianus), both were written in Glagolitic either in Ohrid or in one of the monastic centers in the region.}}</ref> According to [[H. G. Lunt]], "Certain deviations from the theoretical norms indicate Macedonian influences, others possibly Serbian (if not northern Macedonian)".<ref name=Lunt>{{cite book|author=Horace Gray Lunt|year=2001|title=Old Church Slavonic Grammar|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|page=7|url=http://books.google.bg/books?id=7BXJgfIo_fYC&pg=PA7|quote=The Codex Marianus (Mar) has 174 folia, containing the Gospel text from Mt 5:23 to John 21:7.

Most of the Codex (172 folios, 171 according to some sources) was discovered by [[Viktor Grigorovi<U+010D>]] at [[Mount Athos]] during a journey to the [[Balkans]] in 1844-45, in a hermitage belonging to the Monastery of the Holy Mother of God (the Blessed [[Theotokos]]), and thus the manuscript was named ''Codex Marianus'' in Latin. Grigorovi<U+010D> took the found folios to Kazan', and after his death in 1876 the Codex was transferred to [[Russian State Library]] in [[Moscow]] where it carries the catalog number <U+0433><U+0440><U+043D><U+0433> 6 (M.1689). Croatian diplomat and amateur scholar [[Antun Mihanovi<U+0107>]] acquired 2 folios (containing Matthew 5.23 - 6.16) some time before Grigorovi<U+010D> made his discovery, and sent it to renowned Slovene Slavist [[Franc Miklo<U+0161>i<U+010D>]], who had them published in 1850. After Miklo<U+0161>i<U+010D>'s death, the two-folio fragment was deposited in the [[Austrian National Library]] in [[Vienna]] under the catalog number Cod. Slav. 146.

The Codex was first published by Croatian Slavist [[Vatroslav Jagi<U+0107>]] in 1883 in [[Saint Petersburg]] as ''Quattuor Evangeliorum versionis palaeoslovenicae Codex Marianus Glagoliticus'', transcribed in Cyrllic and with extensive philological commentary in [[Latin language|Latin]]. Reprint was published in Graz in 1960.

==Linguistical analyzation==

Analysing the language of the Codex it has been ascertained that one of the scribes of the Codex came from [[<U+0160>tokavian]] area, namely the one under Eastern-rite. On the basis of substitutions ''u'' - ''<U+01EB>'', ''i'' - ''y'', ''u'' - ''v<U+044A>'', ''e'' - ''<U+0119>'' etc. Jagi<U+0107> deduced that the manuscript could have originated on Croatian area or Serbian area (cf. characteristis of [[Old_Church_Slavonic#Croatian_recension|Croatian recension]] and [[Old_Church_Slavonic#Serbian_recension|Serbian recension]]), but [[Josip Hamm]] warns that vocalization of [[yer]]s (''<U+044A>'' > ''o'', ''<U+044C>'' > ''e''), as well as the occasional disappearance of epenthetic ''l'', suggests Macedonian provenience. Text of Codex especially abounds with the usage of [[Old_Church_Slavonic_grammar#Asigmatic_aorist|asigmatic aorist]], and very frequent is the assimilation of vowels in compound adjectival declension and present forms (''-aago'', ''-uumu'' instead of ''-aego'', ''-uemu''; ''-aat<U+044A>'' instead of ''-aet<U+044A>'' etc.).

==Legacy==
