The '''Type U 66''' was a [[ship class|class]] of five [[submarine]]s or [[U-boat]]s operated by the [[German Imperial Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kaiserliche Marine}}) during [[World War I]]. The class is alternately referred to as the '''''U-66''-class''' or the '''Type UD'''. The class was built by [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]] of [[Kiel]]  to their 506d design as the '''''U-7''-class''' for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]]. The five boats were sold to the Imperial Germany Navy at the beginning of World War I when it was thought impossible for the submarines to reach the [[Mediterranean]] for delivery to Austria-Hungary.

The Austro-Hungarian Navy, after competitively evaluating six submarines of three foreign designs, selected the Germaniwerft 506d or Type UD design over a design from [[Whitehead & Co.]] for the ''U-7'' class. The boats, numbered ''U-7'' to  ''U-11'', were designed to be {{convert|228|ft|m}} long and [[displacement (ship)|displace]] between {{convert|695|&|885|t|ST}} when surfaced and submerged. They were to be armed with five torpedo tubes and a [[deck gun]]. For propulsion the design called for twin [[diesel engine]]s for surface running and twin [[electric motor]]s for subsurface movement. The Austro-Hungarian Navy ordered the boats in February 1913 and construction began on the first boats in November.

After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Austro-Hungarian Navy became convinced that delivery of the still-unfinished submarines to the Mediterranean via Gibraltar would be impossible. As a result, they sold the five boats to the Imperial German Navy in November 1914. The German Navy assigned the numbers ''U-66'' to ''U-70'' to the five submarines and had them redesigned and reconstructed to their specifications. These changes, which included a larger deck gun, increased the displacement of the U-boats by almost {{convert|100|t|ST}} surfaced and nearly {{convert|50|t|ST}} submerged.

All five boats saw active service, and four sank 18 or more ships. Only {{SMU|U-68||2}}, sunk six days into her first war patrol in March 1916, had no successes. Two other boats, {{SMU|U-66||2}} and {{SMU|U-69||2}} disappeared in 1917. The remaining two U-boats, {{SMU|U-67||2}} and {{SMU|U-70||2}}, were surrendered to the United Kingdom and were [[ship breaking|broken up]] by 1921.

== Background ==
In 1904, the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]], after allowing the navies of other countries to pioneer submarine developments,<ref name=Con-340>Gardiner, p. 340.</ref> ordered the Austrian Naval Technical Committee ({{lang-de|Marinetechnisches Komitee ''or'' MTK}}) to produce a submarine design.<ref name=Sieche-16>Sieche, p. 16.</ref> When the Navy rejected the January 1905 MTK design and other designs submitted as part of a public competition as impracticable, they instead opted to order two submarines each of designs by [[Simon Lake]], [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]], and [[John Philip Holland]] for a competitive evaluation.<ref name=Con-340 /><ref group=Note>The Lake design became the Austro-Hungarian [[U-1 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-1'' class]], the Germaniawerft design became the [[U-3 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-3'' class]], and the Holland design became the [[U-5 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-5'' class]].</ref>

Based on the trials results, the Austro-Hungarian Navy determined the characteristics that the next generation of Austro-Hungarian submarines should have. They were looking for a [[hull (submarine)|double-hulled]] submarine of about {{convert|500|t|ST}} [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] with diesel propulsion. They also wanted a surface speed of between {{convert|16|&|18|knots|km/h}}, and for the boat to be armed with between three and five {{convert|45|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes.<ref name=Con-340 /> The Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]] 506d design, also known as the Type UD, for the ''U-7'' class over the Type 48 design submitted by [[Whitehead & Co.]], primarily because of the lower cost.<ref name=Con-340 /> The Navy ordered five boats on 1 February 1913.<ref name=Con-343 />

== Design ==
The ''U-7'' class was seen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy as an improved version of its [[U-3 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-3'' class]], which was also a Germaniawerft design.<ref name=Con-343 /><ref group=Note>The [[U-3 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-3''-class]] submarines, however, were less than half the displacement and nearly {{convert|90|ft|m}} shorter than the ''U-7'' design. See: Gardiner, pp. 342<U+2013>43.</ref> As designed for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, the boats were to [[displace (ship)|displace]] {{convert|695|t|ST}} on the surface and {{convert|885|t|ST}} while submerged. The [[hull (submarine)|doubled-hulled]] boats were to be {{convert|228|ft|m}} long ([[length overall|OA]]) with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|20|ft|8|in|m}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|12|ft|5|in|m}}. The Austrian specifications called for two shafts with twin [[diesel engine]]s ({{convert|2300|bhp}} total) for surface running at up to {{convert|17|knots|km/h}}, and twin [[electric motor]]s ({{convert|1240|shp}} total) for a maximum of {{convert|11|knots|km/h}} when submerged.<ref name=Con-343 />

The boats were designed with five {{convert|45|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes; four located in the bow, one in the stern. The boats' armament was to also include a single {{convert|6.6|cm|in|abbr=on}}/26 [[deck gun]].<ref name=Con-343 />

== Construction ==
After the Austro-Hungarian Navy's 1 February 1913 order,<ref name=Con-343 /> the first two boats, ''U-7'' and ''U-8'', were [[keel laying|laid down]] at Germaniawerft on 1 November. ''U-9'' was laid down at the end of December, and the final two boats, ''U-10'' and ''U-11'' were both begun in February 1914.<ref name=allU66s>Helgason, Gu<U+00F0>mundur. [http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=66 WWI U-boats: U 66], [http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=67 WWI U-boats: U 67], [http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=68 WWI U-boats: U 68], [http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=69 WWI U-boats: U 69], [http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=70 WWI U-boats: U 70]. ''U-Boat War in World War I''. Uboat.net. Retrieved on 6 December 2008.</ref> Construction of the boats was slated to be complete within 29 to 33 months.<ref name=Con-343 />

None of the submarines were complete when World War I began in August 1914.<ref name=allU66s /> With the boats under construction at [[Kiel]], the Austrians became convinced that it would be impossible to take delivery of the boats, which would need to be towed into the Mediterranean past [[Gibraltar]], a British territory.<ref name=Con-343 /><ref group=Note>The Germaniawerft-built [[U-3 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-3'' class]] boats had been towed from [[Kiel]] to [[Pula|Pola]] via [[Gibraltar]] in 1909. See: Sieche, p. 19.</ref> As a result, the five boats of the class were transferred to the [[Imperial German Navy]] on 28 November 1914 after the advance payment of 2 million [[Austro-Hungarian krone|Kronen]] had been returned.<ref name=Groener /><ref group=Note>In April 1915, just five months later, the German {{SMU|U-21|Germany|2}} successfully entered the Mediterranean through the [[Straits of Gibraltar]], proving that delivery would have been possible after all. See: Gardiner, p. 343.</ref> Germaniawerft was then awarded ''Kriegsauftrag D'', hence the type was known as ''UD''.<ref name=Groener />

After their purchase, the boats were assigned the numbers ''U-66'' to ''U-70'', and the class became known as the U<U+00A0>66 type. The Imperial German Navy had the submarines redesigned and reconstructed to German standards, which increased the surface displacement by {{convert|96|MT|ST}} and the submerged by {{convert|48|MT|ST}}. The torpedo load was increased by a third, from 9 to 12, and the deck gun was upgraded from the {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun originally specified to an {{convert|88|mm|in|abbr=on}} one.<ref name=Con-177 />

''U-66'' was [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed on 22 April 1915, the first of the class, and was followed by the other four about one every three weeks, with the last boat, ''U-70'', hitting the water on 20 July.<ref name=allU66s /> The boats were all completed and [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed into the Imperial German Navy between July and September.<ref name=allU66s />

== Service career ==
All the boats of the ''U-66'' class saw active service, and all but one boat, {{SMU|U-68||2}}, had wartime successes; {{SMU|U-69||2}} and {{SMU|U-70||2}} both sank over 100,000 tons of Allied shipping.<ref name=allU66s /> ''U-68'' was sunk by the British [[Q-ship]] {{HMS|Farnborough}} in March 1916, and was the first boat of the class to be lost during the war.<ref name=Con-177 /> ''U-69''  and ''U-66'' were lost in July and September 1917, respectively.<ref>Messimer, pp. 85, 88.</ref> {{SMS|U-67||2|sub=y}} and ''U-70'' both survived the war and were surrendered to the United Kingdom in November 1918,<ref name=allU66s /> and both were broken up by 1921.<ref name=Con-177 />
