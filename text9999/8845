'''Lillestr<U+00F8>m idrettspark''', colloquially known as '''Lillestr<U+00F8>m stadion''', is a sports facility located at [[Lillestr<U+00F8>m]] in [[Skedsmo]], [[Norway]]. The main venue is '''Romerike friidrettsstadion''', an [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] stadium with eight [[all-weather running track]]s. It has multiple [[football pitch]]es, including one with [[artificial turf]] and one with gravel. The park features of two [[arena]]s, [[LSK-Hallen]] with a full-size artificial football pitch and [[Skedsmohallen]] for indoor sports. The venue is located adjacent to [[<U+00C5>r<U+00E5>sen Stadion]], the home ground of [[Lillestr<U+00F8>m SK]]. The main tenants for Lillestr<U+00F8>m idrettspark are [[Flisbyen BK]] and Focus FK in football, and [[Str<U+00F8>mmen IF]], L<U+00F8>renskog FIL and Minerva IS in athletics. The stadium opened on 6 June 1920 and was the main venue for Lillestr<U+00F8>m SK until 1951. The athletics stadium opened two years later. In 2004, the artificial turf pitch was laid and in 2007 a new athletics venue and LSK-Hallen opened.

==History==
The stadium opened on 6 June 1920 and was originally named Lillestr<U+00F8>m kommunale idrettsplass ("Lillestr<U+00F8>m Municipal Sports Place"). Lillestr<U+00F8>m SK was the main football tenant from the opening until 1951, when they opened <U+00C5>r<U+00E5>sen Stadion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lsk.no/no/klubben/arasen_stadion/historikk/ |title=<U+00C5>r<U+00E5>sen stadion <U+2013> Historikk |date=27 January 2011 |publisher=[[Lillestr<U+00F8>m SK]] |language=Norwegian |archivedate=26 November 2011 |accessdate=26 November 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/63UdRXZv8}}</ref> The original athletics stadium opened in 1953, located at the same place as the current athletics stadium. Minerva arranged the first tournament on 16 June 1954. Subsequently a [[velodrome]] was installed outside the running track. A municipal grant of 5,000 [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK) allowed a [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]] obstacle to be installed in 1959. A cage for [[discus throw]] and [[hammer throw]] was installed on the current artificial turf pitch in 1970.<ref name=history>{{cite web |url=http://idrett.speaker.no/Downloads/57254/docs/Bane-historie.doc |title=Romerike friidrettsstadion Lillestr<U+00F8>m idrettspark |publisher=Minerva IS |accessdate=31 May 2012 |archivedate=31 May 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/684MDTf5f |deadurl=no}}</ref>

The athletics venue suffered with drainage problems, and from the 1970s it was no longer used for competitions.<ref name=history /> This forced Minerva IS to hold many of its trainings at Stovner stadion in [[Oslo]] and [[UKI Arena|Jessheim stadion]] in [[Ullensaker]]. In 1976, Minerva IS took initiative to lay all-weather running track, but the proposal was rejected by the municipality. In 1990, Skedsmo Municipal Council initially voted to allocate NOK&nbsp;2 million for all-weather running track, but the funding was reallocated to fix a leaking roof on [[Skedsmo Church]]. No further grants were issued for the stadium.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rb.no/lokal_sport/article734914.ece |title=Friidrettsbanen ble kirketak |last=Torvik |first=Per Kristian |work=[[Romerikes Blad]] |date=29 August 2003 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=31 May 2012 |archivedate=31 May 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/684vhTRJd |deadurl=no}}</ref>

In 2004, Lillestr<U+00F8>m SK took initiative to convert one of the gravel pitches to artificial turf. The proposal also saw the installation of [[floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] and [[under-soil heating]]. The new field cost NOK&nbsp;9 million, which was covered by LSK, [[Norsk Tipping|betting grants]] and the municipality. Construction started in August 2004 and was completed in November.<ref name=artificialturf>{{cite news |url=http://www.rb.no/lokal_sport/article1223744.ece |title=Kunstgress p<U+00E5> Lillestr<U+00F8>m stadion f<U+00F8>r jul |last=Torvik |first=Per Kristian |work=[[Romerikes Blad]] |language=Norwegian |date=24 August 2004 |accessdate=31 May 2012 |archivedate=31 May 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/683aWX4B7 |deadurl=no}}</ref> The pitch located behind Skedsmohallen was converted to a throwing venue in 2005.<ref name=history />

Ahead of the [[Norwegian local elections, 2003|2003 municipal elections]], the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] mayor candidates for the municipalities of Skedsmo, [[R<U+00E6>lingen]] and [[L<U+00F8>renskog]], [[Andreas Hamnes]], [[Terje Granerud]] and [[<U+00C5>ge Tovan]], proposed that a central, inter-municipal athletics venue be built for [[Nedre Romerike]].<ref name=history /><ref name=femten>{{cite news |url=http://www.rb.no/lokal_sport/article745672.ece |title="Dette foreslo vi for 15 <U+00E5>r siden" |last=Solbakken |first=Espen |work=[[Romerikes Blad]] |date=12 September 2003 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=31 May 2012 |archivedate=31 May 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/684wF8Esc |deadurl=no}}</ref> The proposal was followed up by the three atheltics clubs in the area, Minerva IS, Str<U+00F8>mmen IF and L<U+00F8>renskog FIL, who established a committee. Several locations were considered, but the committee landed on Lillestr<U+00F8>m idrettspark because of the availability of existing [[utilities]], parking and changing rooms, which would reduce the investment costs.<ref name=history /> In the process, [[Str<U+00F8>mmen stadion]] was rejected because it was undergoing upgrades to receive [[artificial turf]] and [[Marikollen]] was deemed too remote. Also Nordlimyra in L<U+00F8>renskog was deemed unsuitable.<ref name=femten /> The choice of Lillestr<U+00F8>m idrettspark was selected by consensus among the municipalities and the sports clubs in June 2005.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rb.no/lokal_sport/article1143341.ece |title=Enige om Lillestr<U+00F8>m |last=Torvik |first=Per Kristian |work=[[Romerikes Blad]] |date=8 June 2004 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=31 May 2012 |archivedate=31 May 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/684wm2RSq |deadurl=no}}</ref>

Grants were issued from the municipalities in 2005, the size of which was determined by the population of each municipality. [[Multiconsult]] was hired to design the venue and construction started on 28 June 2006. Earthworks were completed by November and asphalting started on 16 May 2007. The all-weather surface was completed on 13 June and technical installations were completed by mid-August. The new venue was inaugurated on 1 September 2007.<ref name=history /> It cost NOK&nbsp;28.6 million, of which NOK&nbsp;15.9 million were paid for by the municipalities in ratio of their population. The rest was financed through a combination of betting grants, [[value added tax]] compensation and volunteer work.<ref name=history />

In 2006, the municipality approved Lillestr<U+00F8>m SK's plans to build an indoor football pitch.<ref name=storhall>{{cite news |url=http://www.rb.no/lokal_sport/article2150323.ece |title=Storhall vedtatt |last=Torvik |first=Per Kristian |work=[[Romerikes Blad]] |date=15 June 2006 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=31 May 2012 |archivedate=31 May 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6853wTVXu |deadurl=no}}</ref> The hall was inaugurated on 11 October 2007 and cost NOK&nbsp;62 million.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rb.no/lsk-magasinet/article3051089.ece |title=Navnet ble LSK-hallen |last=Solbakken |first=Espen |work=[[Romerikes Blad]] |date=11 October 2007|language=Norwegian |accessdate=31 May 2012 |archivedate=31 May 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68549El8i |deadurl=no}}</ref> In 2009, Lillestr<U+00F8>m launched itself as one of six candidate cities for Norway's joint bid with Sweden to host the [[UEFA Euro 2016]]. This would involve building a new venue seating between 35,000 and 44,000 in Lillestr<U+00F8>m. One of three potential locations was at Lillestr<U+00F8>m idrettspark. The stadium would be built in modules, so the upper tiers could be dismounted after the championship and installed on other venues.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rb.no/lsk-magasinet/article4420324.ece |title=Her er Lillestr<U+00F8>ms EM-stadion |last=Torvik |first=Per Kristian |work=[[Romerikes Blad]] |language=Norwegian |date=23 June 2009 |archivedate=26 November 2011 |accessdate=26 November 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/63UenJXVI}}</ref> The proposal was selected as one of four for the bid, but the bid was never sent.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rb.no/lokale_nyheter/article4751207.ece |title=EM-s<U+00F8>knaden skrinlegges |last=Gjermundshaug |first=Alexander |work=[[Romerikes Blad]] |language=Norwegian |date=9 December 2009 |archivedate=26 November 2011 |accessdate=26 November 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/63UenJXVI}}</ref>
