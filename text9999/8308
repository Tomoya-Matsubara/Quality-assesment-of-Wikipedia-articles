The '''Kentucky River''' is a tributary of the [[Ohio River]], 259 mi (417 km) long, in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Kentucky]]. The river and its tributaries drain much of the central region of the state, with its upper course passing through the [[coal]]-[[mining]] regions of the [[Cumberland Mountains]], and its lower course passing through the [[Bluegrass region]] in the north central part of the state. Its watershed encompasses about 7,000 sq. mi (18,000 km<U+00B2>). It supplies drinking water to about one-sixth of the population of the state.

The river is no longer navigable above Lock 4 at [[Frankfort, KY]]. Concrete bulkheads have been poured behind the upper lock gates of Locks 5-14 to strengthen the weakest link in the dam structures. All 14 dams are now under the management of the state-run [[Kentucky River Authority]]. The primary importance of the locks today is to maintain a pool that allows the city of [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] to draw its drinking water from the river. Despite the fact that the Lexington area receives well over 40 inches (1000 mm) of precipitation annually, the [[limestone]],  [[karst]] [[geology]] of that area means that surprisingly little natural surface water is found in the region.

Beattyville, Irvine, Richmond, Lancaster, Nicholasville, Harrodsburg, Wilmore, Versailles, Lawrenceburg, and Frankfort also draw water from the river for their municipal water supplies. It is estimated that over 700,000 people depend on the river for water.

==Description==
[[Image:KentuckyRiver watershed.png|right|thumb|300px|Map of the watershed of the Kentucky River, showing the North Fork, Middle Fork, and South Fork tributaries.]]
It is formed in eastern Kentucky at [[Beattyville, Kentucky|Beattyville]], in [[Lee County, Kentucky|Lee County]], by the confluence of the North, Middle and South Forks at about 670 feet (204 m) elevation, and flows generally northwest, in a highly [[meander]]ing course through the mountains, through the [[Daniel Boone National Forest]], then past [[Irvine, Kentucky|Irvine]] and [[Boonesborough, Kentucky|Boonesborough]], then southwest, passing south of Lexington, then north through [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]]. It joins the Ohio at [[Carrollton, Kentucky|Carrollton]].

Approximately 15 mi (25 km) southwest of Boonesborough it is joined by the [[Red River (Kentucky)|Red River]]. Approximately 20 mi (30 km) southwest of Boonesborough it is joined by [[Silver Creek (Kentucky)|Silver Creek]]. At [[High Bridge, Kentucky|High Bridge]], it is joined by the [[Dix River]]. At Frankfort, it is joined by [[Benson Creek]]. Approximately 10 mi (15 km) north of Frankfort, it is joined by [[Elkhorn Creek]].

Between [[Clays Ferry, Kentucky|Clays Ferry]] in [[Madison County, Kentucky|Madison County]] and Frankfort, the river passes through the [[Kentucky River Palisades]], a series of dramatic steep [[gorge]]s approximately 100 mi (160 km) in length.

According to Robert F. Collins of the [[United States Forest Service]], [[Thomas Walker (explorer)|Dr. Thomas Walker]] named the river, in 1750, Louisa River, after Princess Louisa, the wife of [[Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland]] (Walker had just named the [[Cumberland River]] a month or two earlier). Over time the name Louisa became Levisa and shifted to the nearby stream today called [[Levisa Fork River]].

==Forks==
===North Fork===
[[Image:NorthForkKentuckyRiver.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The North Fork near [[Combs, Kentucky|Combs]].]]The ''North Fork Kentucky River'' is approximately 125 mi (201 km) long.  It rises on the western side of [[Pine Mountain]], in the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] of extreme southeastern Kentucky, in eastern [[Letcher County, Kentucky|Letcher County]] near the [[Virginia]] state line. It flows generally northwest, in a winding course through the mountainous [[Cumberland Plateau]], past [[Hazard, Kentucky|Hazard]] and [[Jackson, Kentucky|Jackson]]. It receives [[Rockhouse Creek]] at [[Blackey, Kentucky|Blackey]] near its source. Approximately 8 mi (13 km) southeast of Hazard, it receives the [[Carr Fork]]. It receives [[Troublesome Creek]] at [[Haddix, Kentucky|Haddix]], southeast of Jackson. Three miles upstream from its confluence with the South Fork, it receives the Middle Fork.  It joins the South Fork to form the Kentucky at [[Beattyville, Kentucky|Beattyville]].

===Middle Fork===
The ''Middle Fork Kentucky River'' is a tributary of the North Fork Kentucky River, approximately 85 mi (137 km) long, in southeastern [[Kentucky]] in the [[United States]].  It rises in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] in extreme southeastern Kentucky, in northeastern [[Harlan County, Kentucky|Harlan County]], approximately 5 mi (8 km) from the [[Virginia]] state line. It flows initially southwest, in the valley on the eastern side of [[Pine Mountain]], then passes along the southeastern end of the ridge, flowing north through the [[Cumberland Plateau]] past [[Hyden, Kentucky|Hyden]]. At [[Buckhorn, Kentucky|Buckhorn]], it is impounded to form the [[Buckhorn Lake]] reservoir. North of the reservoir it flows generally northwest and joins the North Fork in [[Lee County, Kentucky|Lee County]], approximately 5 mi (8 km) east of the confluence of the North and South forks at [[Beattyville, Kentucky|Beattyville]].

===South Fork===
The ''South Fork Kentucky River'' is approximately 30 mi (48 km) long.  It formed in [[Clay County, Kentucky|Clay County]], at the town of [[Oneida, Kentucky]] in the [[Daniel Boone National Forest]], approximately 10 mi (16 km) northeast of [[Manchester, Kentucky|Manchester]], by the confluence of [[Goose Creek (Kentucky)|Goose Creek]] and the [[Red Bird River]]. It flows generally north in a highly [[meander]]ing course through the mountainous [[Cumberland Plateau]] region. It joins the North Fork to form the Kentucky at [[Beattyville, Kentucky|Beattyville]].
