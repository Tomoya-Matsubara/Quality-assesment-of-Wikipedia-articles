'''One Tree''' is a [[location]] on the [[Cobb Highway]] on the flat plain between [[Hay, New South Wales|Hay]] and [[Booligal, New South Wales|Booligal]] in the [[Riverina]] district of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].  In [[1862 in Australia|1862]] a public house was built there <U+2013> the One Tree Inn <U+2013> and the locality developed as a coach changing-stage and watering-place between the [[Murrumbidgee River|Murrumbidgee]] and [[Lachlan River|Lachlan]] rivers.    One Tree village was surveyed and proclaimed in [[1882 in Australia|1882]], though the location remained as just an amenity on the plain, centred on the hotel.  

The existing One Tree Hotel is the second building of that name to occupy the site.  The first hotel was destroyed by fire in [[1903 in Australia|1903]].  The hotel was re-built in the same manner as the original structure (by the provisions of the insurance policy).  The license of the One Tree Hotel was relinquished in [[1942 in Australia|1942]] by its last publican, Frank McQuade.  The One Tree Hotel is an important historical building, providing a tangible link to the heyday of pastoral settlement in the Riverina.<ref name="GDay">{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.gdaypubs.com.au/_FrontBar/BackBar/LastDrinks/Galleries/Gallery2.html | title = One Tree Hotel, Outside Hay NSW | work =  | publisher = Gday Pubs | accessdate = 2007-02-01}}</ref><ref name = "SMHHAY"> [http://www.smh.com.au/news/New-South-Wales/Hay/2005/02/17/1108500193747.html ''Sydney Morning Herald'' article on Hay, NSW]</ref><ref name = "AustHeritage">[http://www.deh.gov.au/cgi-bin/ahdb/search.pl?mode=place_detail;place_id=14363 Australian Heritage Database listing]</ref>

The name <U+2018>One Tree<U+2019> derives from the presence of a large gum tree on the otherwise treeless plain (called the One Tree Plain).  The landmark tree was destroyed by a storm in January [[1900 in Australia|1900]].<ref name = "AustHeritage"/>

==Structure of the hotel==
[[Image:Onetree-01.jpg|thumb|One Tree Hotel in about 1922]]
The One Tree Hotel is constructed of split cypress-pine logs, with verandahs on three sides and a hipped corrugated-iron roof. Twelve-paned windows are located between the four panel doors which open along the verandahs.  There is a detached kitchen and small weatherboard shed at the rear of the building.  The building was an accurate 1903 replication of the original 1862 hotel which had been destroyed by fire.  The insurance company, the Australian Mutual Fire Insurance Society, stipulated the hotel was to be replaced with one identical to the original. 

The One Tree Hotel was placed on the Register of the National Estate in May 1991.<ref name = "AustHeritage"/>

==Literary associations==
An alternate name for One Tree was "Hell", and the locality was referenced in [[Banjo Paterson]]'s poem ''[[Hay and Hell and Booligal]]''.<ref name = "AustHeritage"/> An alternate suggestion is that 'Hell' refers to Hells Gate, a property which lies between Hay and Balranald.<ref name = "SMHHAY"/>
