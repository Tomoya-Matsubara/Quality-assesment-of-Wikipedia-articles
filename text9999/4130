'''Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis''' (July 28, 1929&nbsp;<U+2013> May 19, 1994<ref name=FirstLadies/>) was the wife of the 35th [[President of the United States]], [[John F. Kennedy]], and served as [[First Lady]] during his presidency from 1961 until his [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination in 1963]]. She was later married to [[Greeks|Greek]] shipping magnate [[Aristotle Onassis]] from 1968 until his death in 1975. For the final two decades of her life, she had a successful career as a book editor. She is remembered for her contributions to the arts and historic preservation, her style and elegance, and her public [[stoicism]] in the wake of President Kennedy's assassination.

==Early life==
'''Jacqueline Lee Bouvier''' was born in [[Southampton (village), New York|Southampton, New York]], to Wall Street stock broker [[John Vernou Bouvier III]] and [[Janet Norton Lee]]. Jacqueline had a younger sister, [[Lee Radziwill|Caroline Lee]] (known as Lee), born in 1933. Her parents divorced in 1940 and her mother married [[Standard Oil]] heir [[Hugh D. Auchincloss, Jr.]] in 1942.  Through Janet's second marriage, Jacqueline gained a half sister and a half brother, [[Janet Auchincloss Rutherfurd|Janet]] and James Auchincloss.

[[File:Jacqueline Bouvier by David Berne, 1935.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jacqueline Bouvier in 1935.]]
Her mother's family, the Lees, were mostly of [[Irish American|Irish]] descent, and her father, John Vernou Bouvier III, was descended from [[French American|French]] and [[English American|English]] people. Michel Bouvier, Jacqueline's great-great-grandfather, was born in France and was a contemporary of [[Joseph Bonaparte]] and [[Stephen Girard]]. He was a Philadelphia-based cabinetmaker, carpenter, merchant and real estate speculator.<ref name=Pottker>{{cite book|last=Pottker|first=Jan|title=Janet and Jackie: The Story of a Mother and Her Daughter, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis |year=2003|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0312302819}}</ref> Michel's wife, Louise Vernou was the daughter of John Vernou, a French [[<U+00E9>migr<U+00E9>]] tobacconist and Elizabeth Clifford Lindsay, an American born woman. Jacqueline's grandfather, John Vernou Bouvier Jr., fashioned a more noble ancestry for his family in his vanity family history book ''Our Forebears''. Recent scholarship and the research done by Jacqueline's cousin, [[John H. Davis]], in his book ''The Bouviers: Portrait of an American Family'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=John H.|title=The Bouviers: Portrait of an American family |year=1995|publisher=National Press Books|isbn=1882605195}}</ref> have disproved most of these fantasy lineages.

She spent her early years in [[New York City]] and [[East Hampton (village), New York|East Hampton, New York]] at the Bouvier family estate, "[[Lasata]]".<ref name="queen">{{cite book|last=Bradford|first=Sarah|title=America's Queen: The life of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/books/beginnings/10/24/excerpt.queen.jackie/index.html|accessdate=2010-05-31|year=2000|publisher=Viking|location=New York, N.Y|isbn=0-670-89191-6}}</ref> Following their parents' divorce, Jacqueline and Lee divided their time between their mother's homes in [[McLean, Virginia]] and [[Newport, Rhode Island]] and their father's homes in New York City and [[Long Island]].<ref name=JFKLibrary>{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/JFK+in+History/Jacqueline+Kennedy+in+the+White+House.htm|title=Jacqueline Kennedy in the White House|accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> She attended the [[Chapin School (Manhattan)|Chapin School]] in New York City.

At a very early age she became an enthusiastic equestrienne,<ref name=JFKLibrary/> and horse-riding would remain a lifelong passion. As a child, she also enjoyed drawing, reading and lacrosse.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Education and young adulthood==
Bouvier pursued her secondary education at the [[Holton-Arms School]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]] (1942<U+2013>1944) and [[Miss Porter's School]] in [[Farmington, Connecticut]] (1944<U+2013>1947).<ref name=Pottker/>

When she made her society debut in 1947, Hearst columnist [[Igor Cassini]] dubbed her "[[Debutante#United States|debutante]] of the year."<ref name=IgorCassiniObit>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/09/arts/igor-cassini-hearst-columnist-dies-at-86.html|title=Igor Cassini, Hearst Columnist, Dies at 86 |first=Richard|last=Severo|accessdate=2002-01-09 | work=The New York Times | date=January 9, 2002}}</ref>

Bouvier spent her first two years of college at [[Vassar College]] in [[Poughkeepsie (town), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]], and spent her junior year (1949<U+2013>1950) in [[France]] at the [[University of Grenoble]] and the [[Sorbonne]] in a program through [[Smith College]].<ref name="ReferenceC">{{cite book|title=The First Ladies Fact Book: The Childhoods, Courtships, Marriages, Campaigns, Accomplishments, and Legacies of Every First Lady from Martha Washington to Michelle Obama|first=Bill|last=Harris|first2=Laura|last2=Ross|year=2009}}</ref> Upon returning home to the United States, she transferred to [[George Washington University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], graduating in 1951 with a bachelor of arts degree in French literature.<ref name=FirstLadies>{{cite web|url= http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=36 |title=First Lady Biography: Jackie Kennedy|work=First Ladies' Biographical Information|accessdate=2007-02-06}}</ref> Bouvier's college graduation coincided with her sister's high school graduation, and the two spent the summer of 1951 on a trip through Europe.<ref name=Spoto/> This trip was the subject of her only autobiographical book, ''One Special Summer,'' which is also the only one of her publications to feature her drawings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bouvier|first=Jacqueline Lee|title=One Special Summer|location=New York|publisher=Delacorte Press|year=1974}}</ref>

Following her graduation, Bouvier was hired as the Inquiring Photographer for ''[[Washington Times-Herald|The Washington Times-Herald]]''. The position required her to pose witty questions to individuals chosen at random on the street and take their pictures to be published alongside selected quotations from their responses in the newspaper. During this time, she was engaged to a young stock broker, [[John Husted]], for three months.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

==First Lady of the United States==
===Campaign for Presidency===
[[File:Jfk-appleton.jpg|thumb|right|Jacqueline Kennedy campaigning alongside her husband in Appleton, Wisconsin, in March 1960]]
On January 3, 1960, John F. Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Presidency and launched his nationwide campaign.<ref>{{cite book|first=Barbara|last=Harrison|first2=Daniel|last2=Terris|title=A Twilight Struggle: The Life of John Fitzgerald Kennedy|year=1992}}</ref> Though she had initially intended to take an active role in the campaign, Kennedy learned that she was pregnant shortly after the campaign commenced.<ref>{{cite book|first=Molly Meijer|last=Wertheime|title=Inventing a Voice: The Rhetoric of American First Ladies of the Twentieth Century|year=2004}}</ref> Due to her previous difficult pregnancies, Kennedy's doctor instructed her to stay at home.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite book|first=Carl Sferrazza|last=Anthony|title=As We Remember Her: Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in the Words of Her Family and Friends|year=2003}}</ref> From Georgetown, Kennedy participated in her husband's campaign by answering letters, taping television commercials, giving televised and printed interviews, and writing a weekly syndicated newspaper column, "Campaign Wife."<ref name="ReferenceB"/> She made rare personal appearances.

===As First Lady===

The First Lady wears a gown designed by [[Oleg Cassini]].<ref>{{cite book|title=A Thousand Days of Magic|page=153|first=Oleg|last=Cassini |authorlink=Oleg Cassini}}</ref>]]

In the general election on November 8, 1960, John F. Kennedy narrowly beat Republican [[Richard Nixon]] in the [[U.S. presidential election]].<ref>Looking Backward: A Reintroduction to American History, by Lloyd C. Gardner, William L. O'Neill</ref> A little over two weeks later, Jacqueline Kennedy gave birth to the couple's first son, [[John F. Kennedy Jr.|John, Jr.]] <ref>All the Presidents' Children: Triumph and Tragedy in the Lives of America's First Families, by Doug Wead, 2004</ref> When her husband was sworn in as president on January 20, 1961, Kennedy became, at age 31, one of the youngest First Ladies in history, behind [[Frances Folsom Cleveland]] and [[Julia Tyler]].<ref>The Presidents' First Ladies, by Rae Lindsay, 2001</ref>

Like any First Lady, Kennedy was thrust into the spotlight and while she did not mind giving interviews or being photographed, she preferred to maintain as much privacy as possible for herself and her children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/first_ladies/jacquelinekennedy |title=Jacqueline Kennedy biography |accessdate=2009-09-30 |publisher=White House}}</ref>

Kennedy is remembered for reorganizing entertainment for White House Social events, seeking to restore several White House interiors, her taste in clothing worn during Kennedy's Presidency, her popularity among foreign dignitaries, and leading the country in mourning after her husband's assassination in 1963.

Kennedy ranks among the most popular of First Ladies.<ref name="She is the First Lady who most frequently appears on Gallup's Most Admired Women list.">{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/3415/most-admired-men-women-19481998.aspx |title=Gallup Most Admired Women, 1948-1998 |accessdate=2009-08-18 |publisher=Gallup}}</ref>

===Social success===
As First Lady, Kennedy devoted much of her time to planning social events at the White House and other state properties. She often invited artists, writers, scientists, poets, and musicians to mingle with politicians, diplomats, and statesmen.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baldrige|first=Letitia|title=In the Kennedy Style: Magical evenings in the Kennedy White House|publisher=Doubleday|year=1998|isbn=0-385-48964-1|authorlink=Letitia Baldridge}}</ref>

Perhaps due to her skill at entertaining, Kennedy proved quite popular among international dignitaries. When Soviet Premier Khrushchev was asked to shake President Kennedy's hand for a photo, Khrushchev said, "I'd like to shake her hand first."<ref>{{cite book|last=Perry|first=Barbara A.|title=Jacqueline Kennedy: First Lady of the New Frontier|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2009}}</ref> Jacqueline was well received in Paris, France, when she visited with her husband, and when she traveled with Lee to India in 1962.<ref name=KennedyMistique/>

===White House restoration===
[[File:BoudinBlueRoom.jpg|thumb|[[Blue Room (White House)|The White House Blue Room]] as redecorated by St<U+00E9>phane Boudin in 1962. Boudin chose the period of the [[James Madison|Madison administration]], returning much of the original French Empire style furniture.]]

The restoration of the [[White House]] was Jacqueline Kennedy's first major project. She was dismayed during her pre-inauguration tour of the White House to find little of historic significance in the house. The rooms were furnished with undistinguished pieces that she felt lacked a sense of history. Her first efforts, begun her first day in residence (with the help of society decorator [[Sister Parish]]), were to make the family quarters attractive and suitable for family life and included the addition of a kitchen on the family floor and rooms for her children. Upon almost immediately exhausting the funds appropriated for this effort, she established a fine arts committee to oversee and fund the restoration process; she also asked early American furniture expert [[Henry Francis du Pont|Henry du Pont]] to consult.

Her skillful management of this project was hardly noted at the time, except in terms of gossipy shock at repeated repainting of a room, or the high cost of the antique Zuber wallpaper panels installed in the family dining room ($12,000 in donated funds), but later accounts have noted that she managed the conflicting agendas of Parish, du Pont, and Boudin with seamless success;<ref name=DesigningCamelot/> she initiated publication of the first White House guidebook, whose sales further funded the restoration; she initiated a Congressional bill establishing that White House furnishings would be the property of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], rather than available to departing ex-presidents to claim as their own; and she wrote personal requests to those who owned pieces of historical interest that might be, and later were, donated to the White House.

On February 14, 1962, Jacqueline Kennedy took American television viewers on a tour of the [[White House]] with [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]] of [[CBS News|CBS]]. In the tour she said, "I just feel that everything in the White House should be the best<U+2014>the entertainment that's given here. If it's an American company you can help, I like to do that. If not<U+2014>just as long as it's the best."<ref name=DesigningCamelot/>  Working with Rachel Lambert Mellon, she oversaw redesign and replanting of the [[White House Rose Garden]] and the East Garden, which was renamed the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Garden]] after her husband's assassination. Her efforts on behalf of restoration and preservation at the White House left a lasting legacy in the form of the [[White House Historical Association]], the [[Committee for the Preservation of the White House]] which was based upon her White House Furnishings Committee, a permanent [[Curator of the White House]], the [[White House Endowment Trust]], and the [[White House Acquisition Trust]].<ref name=DesigningCamelot/>

Broadcasting of the White House restoration greatly helped the Kennedy administration.<ref name=DesigningCamelot/> The United States sought international support during the Cold War, which it achieved by affecting public opinion. The First Lady's celebrity and high profile status made viewing the tour of the White house very desirable. The tour was taped and distributed to 106 countries since there was a great demand from the elite as well as people in power to see the film. In 1962 at the 14th Annual [[Emmy Awards]] (NBC, May 22), [[Bob Newhart]] emceed from the [[Hollywood Palladium]]; [[Johnny Carson]] from the New York Astor Hotel; and NBC newsman [[David Brinkley]] hosted at the Sheraton Park Hotel in Washington D.C. and took the spotlight as a special [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences|Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] Trustees Award was given to Jacqueline Kennedy for her CBS-TV tour of the White House. Lady Bird Johnson accepted for the camera-shy First Lady. The actual Emmy statuette is on display in the [[Kennedy Library]] located in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Focus and admiration for Jacqueline Kennedy took negative attention away from her husband. By attracting worldwide public attention, the First Lady gained allies for the White House and international support for the Kennedy administration and its Cold War policies.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1207/s15506878jobem4901_7 | last=Schwalbe | first=Carol B. | title=Jacqueline Kennedy and Cold War Propaganda | journal=Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media | volume=49 | issue=1 | year=2005 | pages=111<U+2013>127}}</ref>

===Foreign trips===
Before the Kennedys visited France, a television special was shot in French with the First Lady on the White House lawn. After arriving in the country, she impressed the public with her ability to speak fluent French, as well as her extensive knowledge of  its history.<ref name=KennedyMistique/> Jacqueline had been aided in her learning of the French language by the prominent [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] educator [[Mar<U+00ED>a Teresa Bab<U+00ED>n Cort<U+00E9>s]].<ref>[http://ponce.inter.edu/cai/MariaTeresaBabin/inicio.html ''Mar<U+00ED>a Teresa Bab<U+00ED>n Cort<U+00E9>s.'' InterAmerican University of Puerto Rico.]</ref>  At the conclusion of the visit, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine seemed delighted with the First Lady and noted, "There was also that fellow who came with her." Even President Kennedy joked, "I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris&nbsp;<U+2014> and I have enjoyed it!"<ref name="Time060961">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,938093,00.html|title=Nation: La Presidente|date=1961 June  09|work=Time|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Jackiesardar.JPG|thumb|right|Pakistani President [[Ayub Khan]] and Jacqueline Kennedy with Sardar.]]
At the urging of [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], President Kennedy's ambassador to India, she undertook a tour of India and Pakistan, taking her sister [[Lee Radziwill]] along with her, which was amply documented in photojournalism of the time as well as in Galbraith's journals and memoirs. At the time, Ambassador Galbraith noted a considerable disjunction between Kennedy's widely-noted concern with clothes and other frivolity and, on personal acquaintance, her considerable intellect.<ref name=KennedyMistique>{{cite book|last2=Goodman|last=Sidey|first2=Jon|first=Hugh|coauthors=Letitia Baldridge|title=The Kennedy Mystique: Creating Camelot: Essays|publisher=National Geographic Books|year=2006|authorlink=Hugh Sidey}}</ref>

While in [[Karachi]], she found some time to take a ride on a camel with her sister.<ref>[http://www.flickr.com/photos/pimu/482325327/in/set-72157594540455482/ Camel ride pic]</ref> In [[Lahore]], Pakistani President [[Ayub Khan]] presented the First Lady with a much-photographed horse, [[Sardar]] (the [[Urdu]] term meaning <U+2018>leader<U+2019>). Subsequently this gift was widely misattributed to the king of [[Saudi Arabia]], including in the various recollections of the Kennedy White House years by President Kennedy's friend, journalist and editor [[Benjamin Bradlee]].  While at a reception for herself at [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]], Kennedy told guests "all my life I've dreamed of coming to the Shalimar Gardens. It's even lovelier than I'd dreamed. I only wish my husband could be with me."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,895946,00.html?promoid=googlep | work=Time | title=Foreign Relations: Benign Competition | date=March 30, 1962 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>

===Death of youngest son===
{{Main|Patrick Bouvier Kennedy}}

Early in 1963, Kennedy became pregnant again and curtailed her official duties. She spent most of the summer at the Kennedys' rented home on Squaw Island, near the Kennedy family's [[Cape Cod]] compound at [[Hyannis Port]], where she went into premature labor on August 7, 1963. She gave birth to a boy, [[Patrick Bouvier Kennedy]], via emergency Caesarian section at [[Otis Air Force Base]], five and a half weeks prematurely. His lungs were not fully developed, and he died at [[Boston Children's Hospital]] of hyaline membrane disease (now known as respiratory distress syndrome) on August 9, 1963. The couple was devastated by the loss of their infant son, and that tragedy brought them closer together than ever before.<ref>Taraborrelli, J. Randy. ''Jackie, Ethel, Joan: Women of Camelot''.

{{Main|John F. Kennedy assassination}}
On November 21, 1963, the First Couple left the White House for a political trip to Texas, stopping in [[San Antonio]], [[Houston]], and [[Fort Worth]] that day. After a breakfast on November 22, the Kennedys flew from [[Carswell Air Force Base]] to Dallas's [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field]] on [[VC-137C SAM 26000|Air Force One]], accompanied by Texas Governor [[John Connally]] and his wife [[Nellie Connally|Nellie]].<ref name="Bugliosi">{{cite book |last=Bugliosi |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Bugliosi |title=Four Days in November: The Assassination of John F.

The First Lady was seated next to her husband in the limousine, with the Governor and his wife seated in front of them. Vice President Johnson and his wife followed in another car in the motorcade.

After the motorcade turned the corner onto Elm Street in [[Dealey Plaza]], the First Lady heard what she thought to be a motorcycle [[Back-fire|backfiring]], and did not realize that it was a gunshot until she heard [[John Connally|Governor Connally]] scream.  Within 8.4 seconds, two more shots had rung out, and she leaned toward her husband.  The final shot struck the President in the head.<ref name="Manchester">{{cite book|authorlink=William Manchester|first=William|last=Manchester|title=Death of a President|year=1967|location=New York|publisher=Harper & Row}}</ref>  Shocked, she climbed out of the back seat and crawled over the trunk of the car.

The car rushed to Dallas's [[Parkland Hospital]], and on arrival there, the president's body was rushed into a trauma room. The First Lady, for the moment, remained in a room for relatives and friends of patients just outside.

A few minutes into her husband's treatment, accompanied by the President's doctor, Admiral George Burkley, she left her folding chair outside Trauma Room One and attempted to enter the operating room. Nurse Doris Nelson stopped her and attempted to bar the door to prevent her from entering. She persisted, and the President's doctor suggested that she take a sedative, which she refused. "I want to be there when he dies," she told Burkley. He eventually persuaded Nelson to grant her access to Trauma Room One, saying "It's her right, it's her prerogative".<ref name="Manchester"/>

Later, when the casket arrived, the widow removed her wedding ring and slipped it onto the President's finger.  She told aide [[Ken O'Donnell]], "Now I have nothing left."<ref name="Bugliosi"/>

After the president's death, she refused to remove her blood-stained clothing, and regretted having washed the blood off her face and hands. She continued to wear the blood-stained pink suit as she went on board Air Force One and stood next to Johnson when he took the oath of office as President. She told [[Lady Bird Johnson]], "I want them to see what they have done to Jack."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/ladybird/epicenter/epicenter_doc_diary.html | title= Selections from Lady Bird's Diary on the assassination: November 22, 1963 | work=Lady Bird Johnson: Portrait of a First Lady | publisher=PBS.org | accessdate=2008-03-01}}</ref>

Kennedy took an active role in planning the details of the [[State funeral of John F. Kennedy|state funeral]] for her husband, which was based on Abraham Lincoln's.  The funeral service was held at [[Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle|St. Matthew's Cathedral]], Washington D.C., and the burial at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]; the widow led the procession there on foot and would light the eternal flame at the grave site, a flame that had been created at her request. [[Jeanne Campbell|Lady Jeanne Campbell]] reported back to ''[[The London Evening Standard]]'': "Jacqueline Kennedy has given the American people... one thing they have always lacked: Majesty."<ref>{{cite news|title=Magic Majesty of Mrs. Kennedy|date=November 25, 1963|first=Lady Jeanne|last=Campbell|newspaper=The London Evening Standard|page=1}}</ref>

Following the assassination and the media coverage which had focused intensely on her during and after the burial, Kennedy stepped back from official public view. She did, however, make a brief appearance in Washington to honor the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent, [[Clint Hill]], who had climbed aboard the limousine in Dallas to try to shield her and the President.

==Life following the assassination==
[[File:Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy.gif|thumb|upright|left|Jackie Kennedy's Official White House Portrait]]
A week after the assassination, Jacqueline was interviewed in [[Hyannisport]] on November 29 by [[Theodore H. White]] of ''[[Life magazine|Life]]'' magazine. In that session, she compared the Kennedy years in the White House to [[King Arthur]]'s mythical [[Camelot]], commenting that the President often played the title song of [[Lerner and Loewe]]'s musical recording before retiring to bed. She also quoted [[Guinevere|Queen Guinevere]] from the musical, trying to express how the loss felt.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=LIFE Magazine|date=December 6, 1963|volume=55|issue=23 |issn=0024-3019|title=For President Kennedy, an Epilogue|first=Theodore H.|last=White|authorlink=Theodore H. White}}</ref>

Her steadiness and courage after her husband's assassination and funeral won her admiration around the world.<ref name="Bugliosi"/>  Following his death, Kennedy and her children remained in their quarters in the White House for two weeks, preparing to vacate. They spent the winter of 1964 in [[Averell Harriman]]'s home in the [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown section of Washington, D.C.]], before purchasing her own home on another block of the same street. Later in 1964, in the hope of having more privacy for her children,<ref name=Adler/> Kennedy decided to acquire an apartment on Fifth Avenue in New York City and sold her new Georgetown house; she also sold the country home in Atoka, Virginia, where she and President Kennedy had intended to retire.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Georgetown Ladies' Social Club: Power, Passion, and Politics in the Nation's Capital|first=C. David|last=Heymann}}</ref> She spent a year in mourning,<ref name=NYTObit/> making few public appearances; during this time, Caroline told one of her teachers that her mother cried frequently.<ref>{{cite book|title=American Legacy: The Story of John & Caroline Kennedy|first=Clemens David|last=Heymann}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Sweet Caroline: Last Child of Camelot|first=Christopher P.|last=Andersen}}</ref>

Kennedy perpetuated her husband's memory by attending selected memorial dedications. These included the 1967 christening of the [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|John F. Kennedy|CV-67}} (decommissioned in 2007), in Newport News, Virginia, and a memorial in [[Hyannisport]], Massachusetts.  They also included the dedication of the United Kingdom's official memorial to President Kennedy at [[Runnymede]], England, and the dedication of a park near [[New Ross]], [[Ireland]]. She oversaw plans for the establishment of the [[John F. Kennedy Library]], which is the repository for official papers of the Kennedy Administration. Original plans to have the library situated in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], near [[Harvard University]], proved problematic for various reasons, so it is situated in Boston. The finished library, designed by [[I.M. Pei]], includes a museum and was dedicated in Boston in 1979 by President [[Jimmy Carter]].

In November 1967, during the midst of the [[Vietnam War]], [[Life Magazine]] recognized Jacqueline as "America's unofficial roving ambassador" during her visit to Cambodia when she met with Chief of State [[Norodom Sihanouk]]. During the visit, Kennedy joined Sihanouk on a visit to [[Angkor Wat]].<ref>[http://www.devata.org/2010/01/angkor-wat-dreams-jacqueline-kennedys-1967-visit-to-cambodia/ Jacqueline Kennedy Visits Angkor Wat] November 1967</ref> At that point, diplomatic relations between the US and Cambodia had been broken since May 1965.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2732.htm US Department of State]</ref>

==Onassis marriage==
{{Refimprovesect|date=November 2009}}
During her widowhood, Jacqueline was romantically linked by the press to a few men, notably [[David Ormsby-Gore]] and [[Roswell Gilpatric]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  But in June 1968 when her brother-in-law [[Robert F. Kennedy]] was assassinated, she came to fear for her life and that of her children, saying "If they're killing Kennedys, then my children are targets...I want to get out of this country."<ref name="jfkjr">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/19/us/john-f-kennedy-jr-heir-to-a-formidable-dynasty.html?pagewanted=all|title=John F. Kennedy Jr., Heir To a Formidable Dynasty|last=Seelye|first=Katherine|date=July 19, 1999|work=The New York Times| accessdate=2009-11-08}}</ref> On October 20, 1968 she married [[Aristotle Onassis]], a wealthy, Greek shipping magnate, who was able to provide the privacy and security she needed for herself and her children.<ref name="jfkjr" />

The wedding took place on [[Skorpios]], Onassis's private island in the [[Ionian Sea]], Greece. After her marriage to Onassis, Jacqueline lost her Secret Service protection and her [[Franking#Franking Privilege|Franking Privilege]], both of which are entitlements to a widow of the President of the United States. As a result of the marriage, the media gave her the nickname "Jackie O." which has remained a popular shorthand reference to her. She became the target of [[paparazzi]] who were following her.

Then tragedy struck again, as Aristotle Onassis's only son [[Alexander Onassis|Alexander]] died in a plane crash in January 1973. Onassis's health began deteriorating rapidly and he died in Paris, on March 15, 1975. Jacqueline's financial legacy was severely limited under Greek law, which dictated how much a non-Greek surviving spouse could inherit. After two years of legal battle, she eventually accepted from [[Christina Onassis]], Onassis's daughter and sole heir, a settlement of $26,000,000, waiving all other claims to the Onassis estate.

==Later years==
{{Refimprovesect|date=March 2010}}
Onassis's death in 1975 made her, then nearly 46, a widow for the second time. Now that her children were older, she decided to find work that would be fulfilling to her. Since she had always enjoyed writing and literature, in 1975 Jacqueline accepted a job offer as an editor at [[Viking Press]].  But, in 1978, the President of Viking Press, [[Thomas H. Guinzburg]], authorized the purchase of the Jeffrey Archer novel ''[[Shall We Tell the President?]]'', which was set in a fictional future presidency of [[Edward M. Kennedy]] and described an assassination plot against him. Although Guinzburg cleared the book purchase and publication with Onassis, upon the publication of a negative ''New York Times'' review which asserted that Onassis held some responsibility for its publication, she abruptly resigned from Viking Press the next day.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Time of their Lives|first=Al|last=Silverman|pages=171<U+2013>172|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2008|location=New York}}</ref> She then moved to [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] as an associate editor under an old friend, [[John Turner Sargent, Sr.|John Sargent]], living in New York City, [[Martha's Vineyard]] and the [[Kennedy Compound]] in [[Hyannis, Massachusetts]]. From the mid 1970s until her death, her companion was [[Maurice Tempelsman]], a Belgian-born industrialist and [[diamond]] merchant who was long separated from his wife.<ref>[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/jbk.htm Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis] at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] website</ref>

She also continued to be the subject of much press attention, most notoriously involving the photographer [[Ron Galella]]. He followed her around and photographed her as she went about her day-to-day activities, obtaining candid, iconic photos of her.<ref>[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A32885&page_number=3&template_id=1&sort_order=1 MoMa collection photo]</ref> She ultimately obtained a restraining order against him and the situation brought attention to [[paparazzi]]-style photography.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/02/nyregion/02folo.html?_r=1&oref=slogin&pagewanted=print&position=|work=New York Times|title=Ambush Photographer Leaves the Bushes|date=January 2, 2005|first=Joseph|last=Fried}}</ref> In 1995, John F. Kennedy Jr. allowed Galella to photograph him at public events.

Among the many books she edited was [[Larry Gonick]]'s ''[[The Cartoon History of the Universe]]''. He expressed his gratitude in the acknowledgments in Volume 2.  Onassis's continuing charisma is indicated by the delight the Canadian author [[Robertson Davies]] took in discovering that at a commencement exercise at an American university at which he was being honored, she was on hand, circulating among the honorees{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}.

[[File:Reagans with Jackie Kennedy.jpg|thumb|right|Former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in 1986 during a visit from the President and First Lady, [[Ronald Reagan|Ronald]] and [[Nancy Reagan]]. Nancy Reagan was the first First Lady since Kennedy to be regarded as generally glamorous, and thus the two were sometimes compared]]
Jacqueline Onassis also appreciated the contributions of African-American writers to the American literary canon. She encouraged [[Dorothy West]], her neighbor on [[Martha's Vineyard]] and the last surviving member of the [[Harlem Renaissance]], to complete ''The Wedding'', a multi-generational story about race, class, wealth, and power in the United States. The novel received great literary acclaim when it was published by Doubleday in 1995; in 1998 [[Oprah Winfrey]] introduced the story via a television film of the same name starring [[Halle Berry]]. [[Dorothy West]] acknowledged Jacqueline Onassis's kind encouragement in the foreword.

She also worked to preserve and protect America<U+2019>s cultural heritage. The notable results of her hard work include [[President's Park|Lafayette Square]] in Washington, D.C, and [[Grand Central Terminal]], New York's beloved historic railroad station.<ref name=DesigningCamelot/> While she was First Lady, she helped to stop the destruction of historic homes in Lafayette Square, because she felt that these buildings were an important part of the nation<U+2019>s capital and played an essential role in its history.<ref name=DesigningCamelot>{{cite book|last=Abbott|last2=Rice|first=James|first2=Elaine|title=Designing Camelot: The Kennedy White House Restoration|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=1997}}</ref> Later, in New York City, she led a historic preservation campaign to save from demolition and renovate Grand Central Terminal.<ref name=Adler/> A plaque inside the terminal acknowledges her prominent role in its preservation. In the 1980s, she was a major figure in protests against a planned skyscraper at [[Columbus Circle]] which would have cast large shadows on [[Central Park]];<ref name=Adler>{{cite book|title=The eloquent Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis: a portrait in her own words|volume=1|first=Bill|last=Adler}}</ref> the project was cancelled, but a large twin towered skyscraper would later fill in that spot in 2003, the [[Time Warner Center]].

From her apartment windows in New York City she had a splendid view of a glass enclosed wing of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] which displays the [[Temple of Dendur]]. This was a gift from [[Egypt]] to the United States in gratitude for the generosity of the [[Kennedy administration]], who had been instrumental in saving several temples and objects of Egyptian antiquity that would otherwise have been flooded after the construction of the [[Aswan Dam]].<ref name="queen"/>

==Death==
In 1993, Onassis was diagnosed with [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]], a form of [[cancer]]. Her diagnosis was announced to the public in February. The family and doctors were initially optimistic, and she stopped smoking at the insistence of her daughter. Onassis continued her work with Doubleday, but curtailed her schedule. By April, the cancer had spread, and she made her last trip home from [[New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center]] on May 18, 1994. A large crowd of well-wishers, tourists, and reporters gathered on the street outside her apartment.  Onassis died in her sleep at 10:15 p.m. on Thursday, May 19, two and a half months before her 65th birthday. In announcing her death, Jacqueline's son, John Kennedy Jr. stated, "My mother died surrounded by her friends and her family and her books, and the people and the things that she loved. She did it in her own way, and on her own terms, and we all feel lucky for that."<ref name="Nicholas A. Basbanes">{{cite book|first=Nicholas A.|last=Basbanes|title=A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books|location=New York|publisher=Owl Books|year=1999|page=32}}</ref>

Onassis' funeral was held on May 23 at [[Church of St. Ignatius Loyola (New York City)|Saint Ignatius Loyola Church]] in Manhattan&nbsp;<U+2014> the church where she was baptized in 1929, and confirmed as a teenager.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/24/us/death-of-a-first-lady-the-overview-jacqueline-kennedy-onassis-is-buried.html?pagewanted=print|page=A1|title=DEATH OF A FIRST LADY: The Overview; Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Is Buried|date=May 24, 1994|first=R.

During her husband's presidency, Jacqueline Kennedy became a symbol of fashion for women all over the world. She retained French-born American fashion designer and Kennedy family friend [[Oleg Cassini]] in the fall of 1960 to create an original wardrobe for her as First Lady. From 1961 to late 1963, Cassini dressed her in many of her most iconic ensembles, including her Inauguration Day fawn coat and Inaugural gala gown as well as many outfits for her visits to Europe, India and Pakistan. Her clean [[suit (clothing)|suit]]s, sleeveless [[A-line]] dresses and famous [[pillbox hat]]s were an overnight success around the world and became known as the "Jackie" look. Although Cassini was her primary designer, she also wore ensembles by French fashion legends such as [[Chanel]], [[Givenchy]], and [[Dior]].  More than any other First Lady her style was copied by commercial manufacturers and a large segment of young women.<ref name=FirstLadies/>

In the years after the White House, her style changed dramatically. Gone were the modest "campaign wife" clothes. Wide-leg pantsuits, large lapel jackets, silk Hermes head scarves and large, round, dark sunglasses were her new look. She often chose to wear brighter colors and patterns and even began wearing jeans in public.<ref name="LIFE">{{cite news  |title = Jackie Kennedy: Post-Camelot Style  |publisher = LIFE |url = http://www.life.com/image/first/in-gallery/31382/jackie-kennedy-postcamelot-style |accessdate = 2009-10-09 }}</ref> She also experimented with different styles, often wearing a large amount of jewelry by [[Jean Schlumberger (Jewelry designer)]] and [[Van Cleef & Arpels]], hoop earrings with her hair pulled back, and gypsy skirts.

==Legacy==
[[File:OnassisGrave.jpg||thumb|Grave of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]]]

In December 1999, Onassis was among 18 included in [[Gallup's List of Widely Admired People|Gallup's List of Widely Admired People of the 20th Century]], from a poll conducted of the American people.

===Honors and memorials===

Onassis's legacy has been memorialized in various aspects of American culture. They include:

*A high school named [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis High School|Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis High School for International Careers]], was dedicated by New York City in 1995, the first high school named in her honor.<ref name="Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis High School">[http://www.nycenet.edu/Offices/StudentEnroll/HSAdmissions/HSDirectory/Book/?boro=M&lcc=M529 Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis High School]</ref> It is located at 120 West 46th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, and was formerly the High School for the Performing Arts.

*A school and an award at the American Ballet Theatre have been named after her in honor of her childhood study of ballet.
*The companion book for a series of interviews between mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] and [[Bill Moyers]], ''[[The Power of Myth]]'', was created under the direction of Onassis, prior to her death. The book's editor, [[Betty Sue Flowers]], writes in the ''Editor's Note'' to ''The Power of Myth'': "I am grateful... to Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, the [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] editor, whose interest in the books of Joseph Campbell was the prime mover in the publication of this book." A year after her death in 1994, Moyers dedicated the companion book for his PBS series, ''[[The Language of Life]]'' to Onassis. The dedication read: "To Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. As you sail on to Ithaka." [[Ithaka]] was a reference to the [[Constantine P. Cavafy|C.P. Cavafy]] poem that [[Maurice Tempelsman]] read at her funeral.
* A white gazebo is dedicated to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis on North Madison Street in [[Middleburg, Virginia]].  Jacqueline and President Kennedy frequented the small town of Middleburg and intended to retire in the nearby town of Atoka.  She also hunted with the Middleburg Hunt numerous times.
