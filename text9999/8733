{{Ottoman-Albanian Wars}}
{{FixHTML|end}}

The '''Siege of Svetigrad''' began on May 14, 1449 when an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army, led by Sultan [[Murad II]], besieged the fortress of Svetigrad. After the many failed Ottoman expeditions into Albania against the [[League of Lezh<U+00EB>]], a confederation of [[Albanian Principalities]] created in 1444 and headed by [[Skanderbeg]], Murad II decided to march an army into Skanderbeg's dominions in order to capture the key Albanian fortress of Svetigrad, near the modern city of [[Debar]]. The fortress lay on an important route between Macedonia and Albania, and thus its occupation would give the Ottomans easy access into Albania. The force prepared by Murad was the largest force with which the Ottomans had ever attacked Skanderbeg. Murad planned to take the fortress, march into the Albanian interior, and capture the main citadel of [[Kruj<U+00EB>]], thus crushing the Albanian League.

[[Skanderbeg]], realizing the magnitude of his challenge, attempted to relieve the garrison by engaging in skirmishes with the Ottoman army. His forces succeeded in inflicting heavy casualties on the Turkish forces through guerrilla-style attacks. Efforts were made by Skanderbeg to use intelligence forces, operating as far as [[Constantinople]], to gather information on Murad's plans of action. Despite these efforts, on July 31 the garrison of Svetigrad surrendered due to a cut-off in the water-supply to Svetigrad. The garrison was spared and a force of Ottoman [[Janissaries]] was stationed inside the fortress instead. The next year, Murad would [[First Siege of Kruj<U+00EB> (1450)|march against Kruj<U+00EB>]], only to suffer a heavy defeat.

==Prelude==
In 1444 the major princes of the [[Albanian Principalities]], which up to that point had been vassals of the [[Ottoman Empire]], united and formed the [[League of Lezh<U+00EB>]], an anti-Ottoman confederacy under the lead of [[Skanderbeg]] and following the example of the [[Principality of Kastrioti]]. As a result, the Ottoman Empire sought to fight the League and to re-establish control of Albania. As of 1449 all these expeditions had failed, and [[Murad II]] decided to personally lead a force into the Albanian territories and fragment the League. The sultan decided to capture the fortress of Svetigrad. This fortress served the strategic purpose of protecting the Albanian eastern frontier, while also serving to allow the Albanians to launch assaults on Ottoman territory.<ref>Hodgkinson p. 95.</ref> 

The Albanian intelligence groups informed Skanderbeg<U+2014>the main leader of the revolt<U+2014>that a large Ottoman army was preparing to march into Albania, the number of which was reported by some intelligence gatherers as being as high as 170,000. This army, however, is likely to have contained no more than 80,000 soldiers.<ref name="Francione74" /> Nevertheless, Murad marched the army into [[Bitola]]. Skanderbeg urgently called for help from the states of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] in the form of material aid. The answer, however, was negative.<ref name="Francione74">Francione p. 74.</ref> Instead, the only aid received came from the [[Kingdom of Naples|Neapolitans]] and the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusans]]. Murad soon marched into [[Ohrid]] and marched up the valley of the [[Black Drin]], traveling near Svetigrad. In response, Skanderbeg strengthened the garrisons of Kruj<U+00EB>, Stellushi, Svetigrad, and [[Berat]] by ordering the population around these fortress to take up arms.<ref>Francione p. 76.</ref> 

Shortly before the Ottoman siege began, Skanderbeg positioned himself, and 4,000 cavalry, {{convert|7|mi|km}} from the Turkish camp.<ref name="Franco98">Franco p. 98.</ref> The force also included 8,000 other soldiers.<ref name="Francione77"/> Skanderbeg ordered that no campfires should be lit in order to keep his positions secret. [[Moisi Arianit Golemi]] and Muzaka of Angelina were ordered, with thirty horsemen, to dress as peasants to enter the fortress.<ref name="Franco98"/> The plot was discovered, however, and the company was attacked, but the attackers were driven off. When they returned to the main Ottoman camp, one of the commanding pashas saw that this was one of Skanderbeg's plots and sent 4,000 horsemen to find out where Skanderbeg was camping at, by following Moisi's band. Moisi led the Ottoman force into a valley, and Skanderbeg, who was ready for such an enterprise, surrounded the valley with his forces. When the Ottoman force was within distance, the Albanians sprung the ambush and the Ottoman force was annihilated. This happened on May 14, 1449, after which Murad ordered the siege to begin.<ref>Franco p. 99.</ref>

==Siege==
===Ottoman arrival===
Murad's force contained approximately 80,000 men and two cannons, which could fire {{convert|200|lb|kg}} balls.<ref name="Francione77"/> His army contained a fresh corps of [[Janissaries]], and 3,000 debtors and bankrupts fighting to regain their freedom. The Count of Gurrica persuaded Skanderbeg to follow a [[scorched earth]] strategy, by destroying all supplies that might be used by the Ottoman army.<ref>Francione pp. 76<U+2013>77.</ref> The Ottoman force paraded around the fortress and offered 300,000 aspras (Turkish currency) to those who would open the gate and let the Ottoman army in the fortress without a fight. The heralds proposing these offers went into the fortress at night time, and they were offered a splendid dinner, so that they would get the impression that the enemy was well prepared for a lengthy siege. After the dinner their offers were rejected and they were sent back to the Sultan.<ref>Hodgkinson p. 97.</ref> The size of the Ottoman army troubled Skanderbeg because of the effects it could have on the morale of the soldiers and of the local population, who was backing up the princes. In order to raise the spirits, Skanderbeg moved from village to village, dressed as a soldier, and encouraged the fighting spirit of the population. As a result of this activity, the local chieftains agreed to fight the Ottomans and persuaded Skanderbeg to draw up his plans in concert with theirs.<ref>Hodgkinson p. 98.</ref>

===Albanian guerrilla attacks===
To relieve the garrison of Svetigrad, Skanderbeg continually harassed the Ottoman army. Many of these attacks had been surprise ambushes of isolated Ottoman forces. Hoping to evade the Ottoman patrols, Skanderbeg moved towards the Ottoman camp. On June 22, Skanderbeg decided to lead a night attack on the Ottoman camp. When the besiegers were taking their afternoon naps, he sent Moses{{who}} with some men, again dressed as peasants, inside the Ottoman camp to reconnoiter.<ref>Hodgkinson p. 99.</ref> Skanderbeg spoke to his troops, encouraging them not to take booty from the camp as this might give the Ottoman forces time to react and launch a counterattack. That night, the Albanians launched their attack, but the noise of the armor and the neighing of the horses prevented the surprise from being complete. The periphery of the camp was thrown into confusion, but the bulk of troops gathered and organized themselves, pushing the Albanians out of the camp, but not before suffering heavy casualties. To prevent further attacks of this sort, Murad detached a contingent of troops under Firuz Pasha, but it was prone to desertion and thoroughly destroyed with its baggage train being captured.<ref>Hodgkinson p. 100.</ref> A breach in the walls was made, but the following infantry assault was repulsed. The Albanians began to hope that the sultan would now be returning to [[Edirne]].

===Stalemate===
The fighting had reached a stalemate and Murad contemplated his next move. He was advised to pillage the countryside, but the surrounding fields had been burned down by Skanderbeg. The sultan decided to stop chasing bodies of men into the forests to prevent further casualties. [[Mehmed II|Mehmed]], Murad's son, advised to leave Svetigrad and strike at [[Kruj<U+00EB>]]. Murad sternly rejected this, due to the reasoning that the supplies to do so would have been wasted, and that Kruj<U+00EB> would be more strongly defended than Svetigrad. The sultan thus decided to remain at Svetigrad in an attempt to starve the garrison into submission.<ref>Hodgkinson 101.</ref> Meanwhile, the garrison, under the leadership of Peter Perlati, made several successful [[sortie]]s against the Ottomans, in order to ease the encirclement, and to raise the morale of the soldiers.<ref name="Franco99"/>

===Surrender of the fortress===
[[Marin Barleti]] writes that the Ottomans bribed a soldier to throw a dead dog into the well of the fortress and the garrison refused to drink out of it. It is more likely, however, that the Ottomans had cut off the water supply and induced the garrison to surrender. <ref>Noli p. 199, note 95.</ref> Given that difficulty, Perlati promised to accept the surrender, if the garrison were allowed a safe passage through the Ottoman lines. Prince Mehmed suggested that the garrison should be promised safe passage and then massacred, but Murad rejected his son's proposal, in fear that the rebellion would be intensified through such an act; he decided instead that the garrisoning force be returned to Skanderbeg.<ref name="Hodgkinson102"/> On July 31 1449 the garrison of Svetigrad surrendered.<ref name="Hodgkinson102"/>

==Aftermath==
Once the fortress had been captured, Murad placed there his own garrison of [[Janissaries]] and ordered for the repair of the walls. Perlati and his men came to Skanderbeg, begging for mercy. Skanderbeg pardoned his soldiers for the surrender and even thanked them for holding out for as long as they did. Skanderbeg shadowed the Ottoman army, as it headed back home in the hopes of dealing some serious damage, but his army was not large enough to risk provoking them. The loss of Svetigrad allowed the Ottomans easy access into Albania from the northeast. They could now launch three coordinated invasions from south, southeast, and northeast into Albania. Skanderbeg tried in vain to regain Svetigrad, but he did not have the proper artillery to do so.<ref>Hodgkinson p. 102.</ref> He surrounded the fortress, but he realized that his position was hopeless and lifted the siege.<ref>Hodgkinson p. 103.</ref>

Ottoman attacks against the the League and Skanderbeg did not stop. The following year the Ottomans would take [[Berat]] through a night attack and Kruj<U+00EB> would be [[First Siege of Kruj<U+00EB> (1450)|besieged]] by Murad.<ref>Noli p. 43.</ref>
