'''Bethlehem''' ({{lang-ar|<big><U+0628><U+064A><U+062A> <U+0644><U+062D><U+0645></big>}}, {{Audio|ArBethlehem.ogg|''Bayt La<U+1E25>m''}}, lit "House of Meat"; {{Lang-el|<U+0392><U+03B7><U+03B8><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03AD><U+03BC>}} ''Bethle<U+00E9>m;'' {{lang-he|<U+05D1><U+05D9><U+05EA> <U+05DC><U+05D7><U+05DD>}}, ''Beit Lehem'', lit "House of Bread") is a [[Palestine|Palestinian]] city in the central [[West Bank]], approximately {{km to mi|10}} south of [[Jerusalem]], with a population of about 30,000 people. It is the capital of the [[Bethlehem Governorate]] of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] and a hub of [[Palestinian culture]] and tourism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/travel/16westbank.html+ |title=In the West Bank, Politics and Tourism Remain Bound Together Inextricably - New York Times |accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref><ref name="BH">{{cite web |url=http://www.bethlehemhotel.com/bethlehem.htm |title=Places to Visit In & Around Bethlehem - Bethlehem Hotel -|accessdate=2008-01-22 }}</ref> Bethlehem is believed by most Christians to be the birthplace of [[Jesus]] of [[Nazareth]]. The town is inhabited by one of the oldest Christian communities in the world, though the size of the community has shrunk in recent years due to emigration. 

The city is the birthplace of [[David]] and the location where he was crowned as the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|king of Israel]]. The city was sacked by the [[Samaritan]]s in 529 CE, during their revolt, but was rebuilt by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Justinian I]]. Bethlehem was conquered by the [[Rashidun|Arab Caliphate]] of [[Umar|'Umar ibn al-Khatt<U+0101>b]] in 637, who guaranteed safety for the city's religious shrines. In 1099, Crusaders captured and fortified Bethlehem and replaced its [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] clergy with a [[Roman Catholic Church|Latin]] one. The Latin clergy were expelled after the city was captured by [[Saladin]], the [[sultan]] of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]]. With the coming of the [[Mamluk]]s in 1250, the city's walls were demolished, and were subsequently rebuilt during the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref name="BMH">{{cite web |url=http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/City/index.php |title=History of Bethlehem |publisher=Bethlehem Municipality |accessdate=2008-01-22 }}</ref>

The British wrested control of the city from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] during [[World War I]] and it was to be included in an [[Corpus separatum|international zone]] under the 1947 [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]]. [[Jordan]] annexed the city in the [[1948 Arab<U+2013>Israeli War|1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. It was occupied by [[Israel]] in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. Since 1995, Bethlehem has been governed by the Palestinian National Authority.<ref name="BMH"/>

Bethlehem has a [[Muslim]] majority, but is also home to one of the largest [[Palestinian Christians|Palestinian Christian]] communities. The Bethlehem [[agglomeration]] includes the towns of [[Beit Jala]] and [[Beit Sahour]], as well as the [[Palestine refugee camps|refugee camps]] of [[Aida (camp)|'Aida]] and [['Azza|Azza]]. Bethlehem's chief [[Economy (activity)|economic sector]] is tourism which peaks during the [[Christmas]] season when Christian pilgrims throng to the [[Church of the Nativity]]. Bethlehem has over thirty hotels and three hundred handicraft work shops.<ref name="Patience">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7146980.stm |first=Martin |last=Patience |work=[[BBC News]] |title=Better times return to Bethlehem |publisher=BBC MMVIII |date=2007-12-22 |accessdate=2008-01-22 }}</ref> [[Rachel's Tomb]], an important Jewish holy site, is located at the entrance of Bethlehem.

==History==
The first historical reference to the town appears in the [[Amarna Letters]] (C. 1400 BC) when the King of Jerusalem appeals to his Lord, the King of Egypt, for help in retaking "''Bit-Lahmi''" in the wake of disturbances by the [[Apiru]].<ref>"''Oxford Archeological Guides: The Holy Land''", [[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]], p198-199, Oxford University Press, 1998, ISBN 019288013-6</ref> Since the Jews and Arabs had not yet arrived in the area it is thought that the similarity of this name to its modern forms inidicates that this was a settlement of Canaanites who shared a Semitic cultural and linguistic heritage with the later arrivals.<ref>"''International Dictionary of Historic Places: Vol 4, Middle East and Africa''", Trudy Ring,  K.A Berney,  Robert M. Salkin,  Sharon La Boda,  Noelle Watson,  Paul Schellinger, p. 133, Taylor & Francis, 1996ISBN 1884964036</ref>
===Biblical era===
Bethlehem, located in the "hill country" of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], may be the same as the Biblical [[Ephrath]],<ref>{{bibleverse||Gen.|35:16}}, {{bibleverse||Gen.|48:27}}, {{bibleverse||Ruth|4:11}}</ref> which means "fertile": There is a possible reference to it as Beth-Lehem Ephratah.<ref>{{bibleverse||Micah|5:2}}</ref> It is also known as Beth-Lehem Judah,<ref>{{bibleverse||Sam|17:12}}</ref> and "the city of David".<ref name = "qjukjz">{{bibleverse||Luke|2:4|KJV}}</ref> It is first mentioned in the Tanakh and the Bible as the place where the Abrahamic matriarch [[Rachel]] died and was buried "by the wayside" (Gen. 48:7). [[Rachel's Tomb]], the traditional grave site, stands at the entrance to Bethlehem. According to the Book of Ruth, the valley to the east is where [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]] of [[Moab]] gleaned the fields and returned to town with [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]]. Bethlehem is the traditional birthplace of [[David]], the second king of [[Land of Israel|Israel]], and the place where he was anointed king by [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]].<ref>{{bibleverse||Sam|16:4-13}}</ref> It was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his warriors brought him water when he was hiding in the cave of [[Adullam]].<ref>{{bibleverse||Sam|23:13-17}}</ref> 

===Roman and Byzantine periods===
[[File:Nativity vorobiev.jpg|thumb|right|View of Church of the Nativity in 1833, painting by M.N.Vorobiev]]
Between 132-135 the city was occupied by the Romans after its capture during the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Kokhba Revolt]]. Its Jewish residents were expelled by the [[military order]]s of [[Hadrian]].<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/bethlehem74/history.htm History of Bethlehem] Bethlehem Homepage</ref> While ruling Bethlehem, the Romans built a shrine to the mythical [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Cult following|cult figure]] [[Adonis]] on the site of the Nativity. A church was erected in 326, when [[Helena of Constantinople|Helena]], the mother of the first [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]], visited Bethlehem.<ref name="BMH"/> 

During the [[Samaritan]] revolt of 529, Bethlehem was sacked and its walls and the Church of the Nativity destroyed, but they were soon rebuilt on the orders of the Emperor [[Justinian I]]. In 614, the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Sassanid Empire]] invaded [[Palestine]] and captured Bethlehem. A story recounted in later sources holds that they refrained from destroying the church on seeing the [[magi]] depicted in [[Iranian art|Persian]] clothing in a mosaic.<ref name="BMH"/>

====Birthplace of Jesus====
{{see|Church of the Nativity|Nativity of Jesus}}
[[File:Jesus birthplace in Bethlehem.jpg|thumb|right|Silver star marking the place where Jesus was born according to Christian tradition]]
Two accounts in the [[New Testament]] describe [[Jesus]] as born in Bethlehem. According to the [[Gospel of Luke]],<ref name = "qjukjz"/> [[Jesus]]' parents lived in [[Nazareth]] but traveled to Bethlehem for [[Census of Quirinius|the census of CE 6]], and Jesus was born there before the family returned to Nazareth. 

The [[Gospel of Matthew]] account implies that the family already lived in Bethlehem when Jesus was born, and later moved to Nazareth.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|2:1-23|KJV}}</ref><ref>Vermes, 2006, p.64.</ref> Matthew reports that [[Herod the Great]], told that a 'King of the Jews' has been born in Bethlehem, ordered the killing of all the children aged two and under in the town and surrounding areas. Jesus' earthly father [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] is warned of this in a dream, and the family escapes this fate by fleeing to Egypt and returning only after Herod has died. But being warned in another dream not to return to Judea, Joseph withdraws the family to [[Galilee]], and goes to live in Nazareth 

[[Early Christianity|Early Christians]] interpreted a verse in the [[Book of Micah]]<ref>{{bibleverse||Micah|5:2|KJV}}</ref> as a prophecy of the birth of the [[Messiah]] in Bethlehem.<ref>Freed, 2004, p.77.</ref> Many modern scholars question whether Jesus was really born in Bethlehem, and suggest that the different Gospel accounts were invented to present the birth of Jesus as fulfillment of prophecy and imply a connection to the lineage of King David.<ref>Vermes, 2006, p.22.</ref><ref>Sanders, 1993, p.85.</ref><ref>Crossan and Watts, p.19.</ref><ref>Dunn, 2003, pp.344-345.</ref> The [[Gospel of Mark]] and the [[Gospel of John]] do not include a nativity narrative or any hint that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, and refer to him only as being from Nazareth.<ref>Mills and Bullard, 1990, pp.445-446. See [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+6:1-4 Mark 6:1-4]; and [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1:46 John 1:46]</ref> In a 2005 article in [[Archaeology (magazine)|''Archaeology'']] magazine, archaeologist Aviram Oshri pointed to the absence of evidence of settlement of the area at the time when Jesus was born,<ref>Aviram Oshri, "Where was Jesus Born?", ''Archaeology'', Volume 58 Number 6, November/December 2005.</ref>

The antiquity of the tradition of Jesus' birth in Bethlehem is attested by the [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]] [[Justin Martyr]], who stated in his ''Dialogue with Trypho'' (c. 155-161) that the [[Holy Family]] had taken refuge in a cave outside of the town.<ref>Taylor, 1993, pp.99-100. "Joseph ... took up his quarters in a certain cave near the village; and while they were there Mary brought forth the Christ and placed him in a manger, and here the Magi who came from Arabia found him."(Justin Martyr, ''Dialogue with Trypho'', chapter LXXVIII).</ref> [[Origen|Origen of Alexandria]], writing around the year 247, referred to a cave in the town of Bethlehem which local people believed was the birthplace of Jesus.<ref>In Bethlehem the cave is pointed out where he was born, and the manger in the cave where he was wrapped in swaddling clothes. And the rumor is in those places, and among foreigners of the Faith, that indeed Jesus was born in this cave who is worshipped and reverenced by the Christians. (Origen, ''[[Contra Celsus|Contra Celsum]]'', book I, chapter LI).</ref> This cave was possibly one which had previously been a site of the cult of [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]].<ref>Taylor, 1993, pp.96-104.</ref>

===Islamic rule and the Crusades===
[[File:Bethlehem-Manger-Square.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mosque of Omar (Bethlehem)|Mosque of Omar (Umar)]] was built in 1860 to commemorate the [[Caliph]] [[Umar]]'s visit to Bethlehem upon its capture by the [[Muslim]]s. It is Bethlehem's only mosque]]

In 637, shortly after [[Siege of Jerusalem (637)|Jerusalem was captured]] by the [[Rashidun army|Muslim armies]], [[Umar|'Umar ibn al-Khatt<U+0101>b]], the second [[Caliph]] visited Bethlehem and promised that the Church of the Nativity would be preserved for Christian use.<ref name="BMH"/> A [[Mosque of Omar (Bethlehem)|mosque]] dedicated to Umar was built upon the place in the city where he prayed, next to the church.<ref name="ATT">{{cite web |url=http://www.atlastours.net/holyland/mosque_of_omar.html |title=Mosque of Omar, Bethlehem |publisher=Atlas Travel and Tourist Agency |accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> Bethlehem then passed from the control of the Islamic caliphates of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Ummayad]]s in the 8th century, then the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]]s in the [[9th century]]. [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer recorded in the mid-9th century that a well preserved and much venerated church existed in the town. In 985, [[Arab]] geographer [[al-Muqaddasi]] visited Bethlehem, and referred to its church as the "Basilica of Constantine, the equal of which does not exist anywhere in the country-round."<ref>le Strange, 1890, pp.298-300.</ref> In 1009, during the reign of the sixth Fatimid Caliph [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], the Church of the Nativity was demolished under his orders. It was soon rebuilt by his successor [[Ali az-Zahir]] to mend relations between the Fatimids and the Byzantine Empire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nmhschool.org/tthornton/mehistorydatabase/persian.php |title=Persian, Greek, Roman, Byzantine Eras |publisher=History of the Middle East Database |date[[2007-12-05]] |accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref>

In 1099, Bethlehem was captured by the [[First Crusade|Crusaders]], who fortified it and built a new monastery and cloister on the north side of the Church of the Nativity. The [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] clergy were removed from their Sees and replaced with [[Roman Catholic Church|Latin]] clerics. Up until that point the official Christian presence in the region was Greek Orthodox. On Christmas Day 1100 [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]], first king of the Frankish [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], was crowned in Bethlehem, and that year a Latin episcopate was also established in the town.<ref name="BMH"/> 

[[File:Bethlehem Polenov.jpg|thumb|right|A painting of Bethlehem, 1882]]

In 1187, [[Saladin]], the Sultan of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] who led the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Muslim Ayyubids]], captured Bethlehem from the Crusaders. The Latin clerics were forced to leave, allowing the Greek Orthodox clergy to return. Saladin agreed to the return of two Latin priests and two deacons in 1192. However, Bethlehem suffered from the loss of the pilgrim trade, as there was a sharp decrease of European pilgrims.<ref name="BMH"/> 

[[William IV, Count of Nevers]] had promised the Christian bishops of Bethlehem that if Bethlehem should fall under Muslim control, he would welcome them in the small town of [[Clamecy, Ni<U+00E8>vre|Clamecy]] in present-day [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], France. As such, The Bishop of Bethlehem duly took up residence in the hospital of Panthenor, Clamecy in 1223. Clamecy remained the continuous '[[Titular see|in partibus infidelium]]' seat of the Bishopric of Bethlehem for almost 600 years, until the [[French Revolution]] in 1789.<ref>de Sivry, L: "Dictionnaire de Geographie Ecclesiastique", page 375., 1852 ed, from ecclesiastical record of letters between the Bishops of Bethlehem 'in partibus' to the bishops of Auxerre</ref>

Bethlehem <U+2014> along with Jerusalem, [[Nazareth]] and [[Sidon]] <U+2014> was briefly ceded to the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] by a treaty between [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] and Ayyubid Sultan [[al-Kamil]] in 1229, in return for a ten-year truce between the Ayyubids and the Crusaders. The treaty expired in 1239 and Bethlehem was recaptured by the Muslims in 1244.<ref>Paul Reed, 2000, p.206.</ref> 

In 1250, with the coming to power of the [[Mamluk]]s under [[Baibars|Rukn al-Din Baibars]], tolerance of Christianity declined; the clergies left the city, and in 1263 the town walls were demolished. The Latin clergy returned to Bethlehem the following century, establishing themselves in the monastery adjoining the Basilica of the Nativity. The Greek Orthodox were given control of the basilica and shared control of the Milk Grotto with the Latins and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenians]].<ref name="BMH"/>

===Ottoman and Egyptian era===
[[File:Bethlehem street 1880.jpg|thumb|right|A crowded street in Bethlehem, 1880]]

[[File:Bethlehem 1898.jpg|thumb|right|View of Bethlehem, 1898]]

From 1517, during the years of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control, custody of the Basilica was bitterly disputed between the Catholic and Greek [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox churches]].<ref name="BMH"/> By the end of the 16th century, Bethelem had become one of the largest villages in the District of Jerusalem, and was subdivided into seven quarters.<ref name="Singer"/>  The Basbus family served as the heads of Bethlehem among other leaders during this period.<ref>Singer, 1994, p.33.</ref>

Bethlehem paid taxes on wheat, barley, and grapes. The Muslims and Christians were organized into separate communities, each having its own leader; five leaders represented the village in the mid-16th century, three of whom were Muslims. Ottoman tax records suggest that the Christian population was slightly more prosperous or grew more grain as opposed to grapes, the former being a more valuable commodity.<ref>Singer, 1994, p.84</ref>

From 1831 to 1841, Palestine was under the rule [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty]] of [[Egypt]]. During this period, the town suffered an earthquake as well as the destruction of the Muslim quarter in 1834 by Egyptian troops, apparently as a reprisal for the murder of a favored loyalist of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]].<ref>Thomson, 1860, p.647.</ref> In 1841, Bethlehem came under Ottoman rule once more and remained so until the end of the World War I. Under the Ottomans, Bethlehem's inhabitants faced unemployment, [[Conscription|compulsory military service]] and heavy taxes, resulting in mass emigration particularly to [[South America]].<ref name="BMH"/> An American missionary in the 1850's reports an population of under 4,000, 'nearly all of them belong to the Greek Church.' He also comments that 'there is a fatal lack of water' and hence it could never become a large town.<ref>W. M. Thomson, p.647.</ref>

===Twentieth century===
Bethlehem was administered by the British Mandate from 1920 until 1948.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/63429/Bethlehem Bethlehem]</ref> In the [[United Nations General Assembly]]'s [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|1947 resolution to partition Palestine]], Bethlehem was included in the special [[Corpus separatum|international enclave of Jerusalem]] to be administered by the [[United Nations]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://imeu.net/news/article00125.shtml |title=IMEU: Maps: 2.7 - Jerusalem and the Corpus Separatum proposed in 1947 |accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref>

Jordan retained control of the city until the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, when Bethlehem was occupied by Israel, along with the rest of the [[West Bank]]. On December 21, 1995, Israeli troops withdrew from Bethlehem,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/chronology/19941995.htm |title=Palestine Facts Timeline: 1994-1995 |publisher=[[Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs]] |accessdate=2008-03-29}}</ref> and three days later the city came under the complete administration and military control of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] in conformance with the [[Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/EVENTS/seasons_greetings/bethlehem_celebration/ |title=Muslims, Christians celebrate in Bethlehem |first=Jerrold |last=Kessel |work=[[CNN|CNN News]] |publisher=Cable News Network |date=1995-12-24 |accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref>

During the operation, the IDF [[Siege of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem|besieged the Church of the Nativity]], where about 200 Palestinians, including a group of militants, sought refuge amid IDF advancements into the city. The siege lasted for 39 days and nine militants and the church's bellringer were killed. It ended with an agreement to exile thirteen of the wanted militants to various European nations and [[Mauritania]]. [[Pope John Paul II]] condemned Israel's actions, describing them as reaching "unimaginable and intolerable" levels and the United Kingdom's [[Foreign minister|foreign ministry]] stated they were "totally unacceptable".<ref name="BBC"/>

[[File:Bethlehem4.jpg|thumb|right|Four Bethlehem Christian women, 1911]]

The majority of Bethlehem's Christian inhabitants claim ancestry from [[Arab Christians|Arab Christian]] clans from the [[Arabian Peninsula]], including the city's two largest: al-Farahiyya and an-Najajreh. The former claims to have descended from the [[Ghassanids]] who migrated from [[Yemen]] to the [[Wadi Musa]] area in present-day [[Jordan]] and an-Najajreh descend from the Arabs of [[Najran]] in the southern [[Hejaz]]. Another Bethlehem clan, al-Anantreh, also trace their ancestry to the Arabian Peninsula.<ref>[http://admusallam.bethlehem.edu/bethlehem/beth-hlccni.htm Bethlehem, The Holy Land<U+2019>s Collective Cultural National Identity: A Palestinian Arab Historical Perspective] Musallam, Adnan.

The percentage of Christians in Bethlehem has been steadily falling, primarily due to continuous emigration. The lower birth rate among Christians as compared to Muslims also accounts for some of the decline. In 1947, Christians made up 75% of the population, but by 1998 this figure had declined to 23%.<ref name="AP"/> The current mayor of Bethlehem, [[Victor Batarseh]] told the [[Voice of America]] that, "due to the stress, either physical or psychological, and the bad economic situation, many people are emigrating, either Christians or Muslims, but it is more apparent among Christians, because they already are a minority."<ref name="VOA">{{cite news|title=Christians Disappearing in the Birthplace of Jesus|author=Jim Teeple|publisher=Voice of America|date=24 December 2005|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2005-12/2005-12-24-voa17.cfm?CFID=43253380&CFTOKEN=44091067}}</ref></blockquote>

The [[Hamas]] government's official position has been to support the city's Christian population, though the party at times has been criticized by some anonymous residents for increasing the Islamic presence in the city by, for example, activating the call to prayer at a previously unused local mosque in a Christian neighborhood. According to the [[The Jerusalem Post|Jerusalem Post]], under Hamas, the Christian population faces a lack of law and order which has left it susceptible to land theft by local mafia who take advantage of ineffective courts and the perception that the Christian population is less likely to stand up for itself.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1164881946344&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post|Jerusalem Post]]|title=Is Christianity dying in Bethlehem?|author=Joerg Luyken|date=21 December 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=1&cid=1167467807655&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post|Jerusalem Post]]|title=Bethlehem Christians fear neighbors|author=[[Khaled Abu Toameh]]|date=January 25, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Palestinian Christians Look Back on a Year of Troubles|publisher=[[The New York Times|New York Times]]|date=2007-03-11|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/world/middleeast/11christians.html?_r=1&oref=slogin}}</ref>

==Culture==
===Embroidery===
{{See also|Palestinian costumes}}

[[File:Bethlehem woman edited.jpg|thumb|right|A woman in Bethlehem. Her headdress and short jacket are typical of the Bethlehem area.]]

Before the establishment of Israel as a state, Bethlehem costumes and embroidery were popular in villages throughout the Judaean Hills and the [[coastal plain]]. The women embroiderers of Bethlehem and the neighboring villages of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour were known to be professional producers of wedding costumes.<ref name=PCA2>{{cite web |title=Palestine costume before 1948: by region |publisher=Palestine Costume Archive |accessdate=2008-01-28 |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20061024053919/http://www.palestinecostumearchive.org/regional.htm}}</ref> Bethlehem was a center for embroidery producing a "strong overall effect of colors and metallic brilliance."<ref>{{cite book |last=Stillman |first=Yedida Kalfon |title=Palestinian costume and jewelry |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |year=1979 |location=Albuquerque |pages=p.&nbsp;46 |isbn=0-8263-0490-7 }}</ref>

Less formal dresses in Bethlehem were generally made of indigo fabric and a sleeveless coat (''bisht''), made from locally woven wool, was worn over top. Dresses for special occasions were made of striped silk with winged sleeves and the short ''taqsireh'' jacket, known throughout Palestinian as the Bethlehem jacket, was worn over it. The taqsireh was made of [[velvet]] or [[broadcloth]], usually with heavy embroidery.<ref name=PCA2/> 

Bethlehem work was unique in its use of couched gold or silver cord, or silk cord onto the silk, wool, felt or velvet used for the garment, to create stylized floral patterns with free or rounded lines. This technique was used for "royal" [[wedding dress]]es (''thob malak''), taqsirehs and the ''shatwehs'' worn by married women. It has been traced by some to [[Byzantium]], and by others to the more formal costumes of the Ottoman Empire's elite. As Bethlehem was a Christian village, local women were also exposed to the detailing on church vestments with their heavy embroidery and silver brocade.<ref name=PCA2/>

The art of mother-of-pearl carving has been a Bethlehem tradition since the 14th century when it was introduced to the city by [[Franciscan]] [[friar]]s from [[Damascus]].<ref name="BM">[http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/City/Heritage/HnadCraft.php  Bethlehem municipality website]</ref> Bethlehem's position as an important Christian city has for centuries attracted a constant stream of [[pilgrim]]s. This generated much local work and income, also for women, including making mother-of-pearl souvenirs.<ref>Weir, p.128, 280, n.30 </ref> It was noted by [[Richard Pococke]],  who travelled there in 1727. <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=wY4qAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0#PPA436,M1   ''A Description of the East and Some other Countries''], p. 436</ref>

Bethlehem has four museums located within its municipal borders. The Crib of the Nativity Theatre and Museum offers visitors 31 3D models depicting the significant stages of the life of Jesus. Its theater presents a 20-minute animated show. The [[Badd Giacaman Museum]], located in the Old City of Bethlehem, dates back to the 18th century and is primarily dedicated to the history and process of [[olive oil]] production.<ref name="BH"/>

===Festivals===
[[File:Bethlehem Christmas pilgrims enter town 1890.jpg|thumb|right|Christmas pilgrims, 1890]]

Christmas rites are held in Bethlehem on three different dates: December 25 is the traditional date by the Roman Catholic and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations, but Greek, [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrian Orthodox]] Christians celebrate Christmas on January 6 and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Orthodox]] Christians on January 19. Most Christmas processions pass through Manger Square, the plaza outside the Basilica of the Nativity.

Bethlehem, like other Palestinian localities, participates in festivals related to saints and prophets that are attached to Palestinian folklore. One such festival is the annual [[Feast of Saint George]] ([[Al-Khidr|al-Khadr]]) on 5 May-6 May. During the celebrations, Greek Orthodox Christians from the city march in procession to the nearby town of [[al-Khader, Bethlehem|al-Khader]] to baptize newborns in the waters around the [[Monastery of Saint George, al-Khader|Monastery of St. George]] and sacrifice a sheep in ritual.<ref>[http://74.125.45.104/search?q=cache:fJV8drrNIiAJ:www.bethlehem.ps/religious_sites/feasts/st_george.php+Khader+Feast+of+Saint+George&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=9&gl=us&client=firefox-a St. George's Feast] Bethlehem.ps.</ref> 

The Feast of St. [[Elijah]] (Mar Elias) is held in a similar way, except the procession is towards the Monastery of [[Elijah|St. Elijah]] to the north of Bethlehem. The feast commemorates the miracles attributed to the saint, a popular figure in Palestine. Prior, to restrictions imposed on the residents by Israel, local Christians used to visit the monastery, bringing various gifts, such as bread, olive oil and candles. The candles would be lit and the oil would be placed in front of [[icon]]s in the church, while the bread was handed to the monks.<ref>[http://74.125.45.104/search?q=cache:MNLK2kodDgYJ:www.bethlehem.ps/religious_sites/feasts/mar_elias.php+Feast+of+Mar+Elias+Bethlehem&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=us&client=firefox-a St. Elijah's (Mar Elias) Feast] Bethlehem.ps</ref>

==Government==
[[File:Bethlehem-hamasrally.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Hamas]] rally in Bethlehem]]
Bethlehem is the ''muhfaza'' (seat) or district capital of the [[Bethlehem Governorate]]. 

Bethlehem held its first municipal elections in 1876, after the ''mukhtars'' ("heads") of the quarters of Bethlehem's Old City (excluding the Syriac Quarter) made the decision to elect a local council of seven members to represent each clan in the town. A [[Basic law|Basic Law]] was established so that if the victor for mayor was a Catholic, his deputy should be of the Greek Orthodox community.<ref name="BME"/> 

Throughout, Bethlehem's rule by the British and Jordan, the Syriac Quarter was allowed to participate in the election, as were the Ta'amrah [[Bedouin]]s and Palestinian refugees, hence ratifying the amount of municipal members in the council to eleven. In 1976, an amendment was passed to allow women to vote and become council members and later the voting age was increased from 21 to 25.<ref name="BME">[http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/TempVewMenuSub.php?Mid=6 Municipal Council Elections during the British and Jordanian Periods] Bethlehem Municipal Council.</ref>  

Today, the Bethlehem Municipal Council consists of fifteen elected members, including the mayor and deputy mayor. A special statute requires that the mayor and a majority of the municipal council be Christian, while the remainder are open seats, not restricted to any religion.<ref name="Day"/> 

There are several branches of political parties on the council, including [[Communism|Communist]], [[Islamism|Islamist]], and secular. The leftist factions of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) such as the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) and the [[Palestinian People's Party]] (PPP) usually dominate the reserved seats. [[Hamas]] gained the majority of the open seats in the 2005 [[Palestinian municipal elections, 2005|Palestinian municipal elections]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/Counil/index.php+ |title=Bethlehem Municipality(Site Under Construction) |accessdate=2008-01-22 }}</ref>

==Education==
According to the [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] (PCBS), in 1997, approximately 84% of Bethlehem's population over the age of 10 was literate. Of the city's population, 10,414 were enrolled in schools (4,015 in [[Primary education|primary school]], 3,578 in secondary and 2,821 in high school). About 14.1% of high school students received diplomas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/bet_t3.aspx |title=Palestinian Population (10 Years and Over) by Locality, Sex and Educational Attainment |accessdate=2008-01-22 |publisher=[[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]]}}</ref> There were 135 schools in the [[Bethlehem Governorate]] in 2006; 100 run the [[Education Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority]], seven by the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|United Nations Relief and Works Agency]] (UNRWA) and 28 were private.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mohe.gov.ps/downloads/pdffiles/statisticE.pdf |title=Statistics about General Education in Palestine 2005-2006 |publisher=[[Education Minister of the Palestinian National Authority]] |accessdate=2008-01-22|format=PDF}}</ref> 

Bethlehem is home to [[Bethlehem University]], a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] Christian co-educational institution of higher learning founded in 1973 in the Lasallian tradition, open to students of all faiths. Bethlehem University is the first university established in the West Bank, and can trace its roots to 1893 when the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|De La Salle Christian Brothers]] opened schools throughout Palestine and Egypt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bethlehem.edu/about/history.shtml |title=Bethlehem University - History |publisher=[[Bethlehem University]] |accessdate=2008-01-22 }}</ref>

==Transportation==
[[File:Bethlehem-street2.JPG|thumb|left|A street in Bethlehem lined with taxis]]

===Services===
Bethlehem has three bus stations owned by private companies which offer service to Jerusalem, Beit Jala, Beit Sahour, [[Hebron]], [[Nahalin]], [[Battir]], [[al-Khader, Bethlehem|al-Khader]], [[al-Ubeidiya]] and [[Beit Fajjar]]. There are two taxi stations that make trips to Beit Sahour, Beit Jala, Jerusalem, [[Tuqu']] and [[Herodium]]. There are also two car rental departments: Murad and 'Orabi. Buses and taxis with West Bank licenses are not allowed to enter Israel, including Jerusalem, without a permit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/City/TransSys.php |title=Bethlehem Public Transport System |accessdate=2008-01-22 }} Bethlehem Municipality.</ref>

===Movement restrictions===
[[File:BethlehemRoad.jpg|right|thumb|Main entrance into Bethlehem from [[Jerusalem]], 2005]]

The Israeli construction of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|West Bank barrier]] has had an impact on Bethlehem politically, socially, and economically. The barrier runs along the northern side of the town's built-up area, within meters of houses in 'Aida [[refugee camp]] on one side, and the Jerusalem municipality on the other.<ref name=OCHA/>

Most entrances and exits from the Bethlehem agglomeration to the rest of the [[West Bank]] are currently subject to [[Israel Defense Forces checkpoint|Israeli checkpoints]] and roadblocks. The level of access varies based on Israeli security directives. Travel for Bethlehem's Palestinian residents from the West Bank into Israeli-annexed Jerusalem is regulated by a permit-system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/db942872b9eae454852560f6005a76fb/b45e8d8caacda74785256dbb0062e7b9!OpenDocument+ |title=Impact of Israel's separation barrier on affected West Bank communities - OCHA update report #2 (30 September 2003) |accessdate=2008-01-22 |format= |work=}}</ref> Acquiring such permits to enter, what in the past served in many ways as an urban anchor to Bethlehem, has become exceedingly rare since the onset of the violence surrounding the Second Intifada, though Israel has subsequently erected a terminal to ease transit between the two adjoining cities.<ref name=OCHA/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAl.NSF/3822b5e39951876a85256b6e0058a478/0306124470443c948525712b006a70b7!OpenDocument+ |title=Question of the violation of human rights in the occupied Arab territories, including Palestine 17 January 2006 |accessdate=2008-01-22 |author=John Dugard |work=Commission on Human Rights }}</ref>

Palestinians are not allowed to enter the Jewish holy site of [[Rachel's Tomb]], which is on the outskirts of the city, without a permit. Since Bethlehem and the nearby biblical [[Solomon's Pools]] lie in Area A (territory under both PNA military and civil administration), Israeli citizens are barred without a permit from the Israeli military authorities.<ref name=OCHA/>
