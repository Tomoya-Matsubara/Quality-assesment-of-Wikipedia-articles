'''Ariane 6''' is a [[launch vehicle]] being developed by the European Space Agency to replace the [[Ariane 5]] launch vehicle, and is the newest member in the  [[Ariane (rocket family)|Ariane launch vehicle family]]. ESA has finalised the preliminary design of the next generation rocket; a smaller more flexible rocket, featuring the same payload fairing diameter as the Ariane 5 ME and capable of launching a single satellite of 3 to 6.5 tonnes to a geostationary transfer orbit. The vehicle is a three stage design in which the first stage uses three identical solid rocket motors in a side-by-side configuration, the second stage will use a single identical solid rocket motor mounted above the first stage, the third stage will be a restartable liquid cryogenic [[Vinci (rocket engine)|Vinci]] engine to allow for complex and high energy orbits. The four motors of the first and second stage will each carry 135 tonnes of solid propellant and have an empty mass of 10 tonnes <ref>http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESA_HQ/Technicalconditionsv10.pdf</ref>.

==Development History==
In 2012, detailed definition studies were funded.<ref name=sfn-20121121>{{cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1211/21ariane/ |title=European ministers decide to stick with Ariane 5, for now |author=Stephen Clark |publisher=Spaceflight Now |date=21 November 2012 |accessdate=22 November 2012}}</ref><ref name=bbc-20121123>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20464639 |title=Ariane rocket ready to do battle |author=Jonathan Amos |publisher=BBC |date=23 November 2012 |accessdate=23 November 2012}}</ref> ESA will in 2014 decide on full funding, which could lead to a launch around 2021. The chairman the [[German Aerospace Center]] commented that while building {{nowrap|Ariane 6}} in one location would be much more efficient, but "then it is no longer a European launcher. It is a French or German launcher. Therefore, the discussion about industrial distribution is one of the core questions for the next launcher in Europe. It is hard stuff."<ref name=sfn-20121121/>

A new launch pad location in [[French Guiana]] has been selected, and completion of the {{nowrap|Ariane 6}} design in July 2013 is expected to kick off design of the launch pad.  CNES is aiming to launch the {{nowrap|Ariane 6}} a minimum of eight times each year, with a goal of supporting twelve annual launches.<ref name=sn20130524a/>

The target "production and operations [[cost]]" for the launch system is 70 million Euros per launch, a 30% reduction in the cost of launching an equivalent 6.5 tonne payload on the Ariane 5, although this is not necessarily the launch [[price]] at which Ariane launches will be offered to launch customers.<ref name=sn20130524a>
