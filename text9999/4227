Sherman's most successful film was adapted from the original script ''Alive and Kicking/Indian Summer'', which he authored himself. On [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and in the [[West End theatre|West End]] he is best known for ''[[Bent (play)|Bent]]'', which was nominated for a [[Tony Award]] in 1980. This play was the first to deal with the treatment of [[homosexuals]] by the [[Nazis]] during [[World War II]]. Set primarily in a [[concentration camp]], it generated controversy for the two scenes in which gay inmates achieve climax through words. He also wrote the book for the musical ''[[The Boy from Oz]]'', based on [[Peter Allen]]'s life and career, earning him a second Tony nomination.

Sherman has written two collections of gay-themed plays.  His play ''Rose'' was nominated for a [[Laurence Olivier Award]] for Best New Play in 2000. [[Olympia Dukakis]] starred in the Broadway production that same year.
