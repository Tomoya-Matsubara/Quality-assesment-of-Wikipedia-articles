The '''R<U+00E9>union Ibis''' or '''R<U+00E9>union Sacred Ibis''' (''Threskiornis solitarius'') is an [[list of extinct birds|extinct]] [[species]] of [[ibis]] that was [[endemic]] to the volcanic island of [[R<U+00E9>union]] in the Indian Ocean. The first sub-fossil remains were found in 1974, and the ibis was first scientifically described in 1987. Its closest relatives are the [[Malagasy Sacred Ibis]], the [[African Sacred Ibis]], and the [[Straw-necked Ibis]].

Travellers' accounts from the 17th and 18th centuries described a white bird that flew with difficulty, and it was subsequently referred to as the '''R<U+00E9>union Solitaire'''. In the mid<U+2010>19th century, the old travellers accounts were incorrectly assumed to refer to white relatives of the [[Dodo]], due to one account specifically mentioning Dodos on the island, and because 17th-century paintings of white Dodos had recently surfaced. However, no fossils referable to Dodo-like birds were ever found on R<U+00E9>union, and it was later questioned whether the paintings had anything to do with the island. Other identities were suggested as well, based only on speculation. In the late 20th century, the discovery of a [[subfossil]] ibis led to the idea that the old accounts actually referred to an ibis species instead. The idea that the solitaire and the subfossil ibis are identical has only met with limited dissent, and is now widely accepted. 

Combined, the old descriptions and subfossils show that the R<U+00E9>union Ibis was mainly white, with this colour merging into yellow and grey. The wing tips and plumes of [[ostrich]]-like feathers on its rear were black. The neck and legs were long, the beak was relatively straight and short for an ibis. It was more robust in build than its extant relatives, but was otherwise quite similar to them. Subfossil wing-bones indicate it had reduced flight capabilities, a feature perhaps linked to seasonal fattening. The diet of the R<U+00E9>union Ibis was worms and other items foraged from soil. It preferred solitude (hence the name "solitaire"). In the 17th century, it lived in mountainous areas, but it may have been confined to these remote heights by heavy hunting by humans and predation by [[introduced animals]] in the more accessible areas of the island. Visitors to R<U+00E9>union praised its flavour, and therefore sought after its flesh. These factors are believed to have driven the R<U+00E9>union Ibis to extinction by the early 18th century.

==Taxonomy==
The taxonomic history of the R<U+00E9>union Ibis is convoluted and complex, due to the ambiguous and meagre evidence that was available to scientists until recently. The supposed "white Dodo" of R<U+00E9>union is now believed to have been an erroneous conjecture based on the few contemporary reports which described the R<U+00E9>union Ibis, combined with paintings of white Dodos from Mauritius by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] painters [[Pieter Withoos]] and [[Pieter Holsteyn II]] (and derivatives) from the 1600s that surfaced in the 19th century.<ref name="White Dodo"/> 
[[File:Reunion dodo.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Painting of a white Dodo among various birds|Pieter Withoos's late 1600s painting of a white Dodo, the first of such paintings to be discovered]]
The English Chief Officer John Tatton was the first to mention a specifically white bird on R<U+00E9>union, in 1625. The French occupied the island from 1646 and onwards, and referred to this bird as the "solitaire". M. Carr<U+00E9> of the [[French East Indies Company]] described the solitaire in 1699, explaining the reason for its name:
{{Quotation|I saw a kind of bird in this place which I have not found elsewhere; it is that which the inhabitants call the Oiseaux Solitaire for to be sure, it loves solitude and only frequents the most secluded places; one never sees two or more together; it is always alone. It is not unlike a turkey, if it did not have longer legs. The beauty of its plumage is a delight to see. It is of changeable colour which verges upon yellow. The flesh is exquisite; it forms one of the best dishes in this country, and might form a dainty at our tables. We wished to keep two of these birds to send to France and present them to His Majesty, but as soon as they were on board ship, they died of melancholy, having refused to eat or drink.<ref name="Strickland"/>}}
A [[marooning|marooned]] French [[Huguenot]], [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Leguat]], used the name "solitaire" for the [[raphine]] bird he encountered on the nearby island of [[Rodrigues]] in the 1690s, but it is thought he borrowed the name from a 1689 [[Tract (literature)|tract]] by Marquis Henri Duquesne which mentioned the R<U+00E9>union species. Duquesne himself had probably based his own description on an earlier one.<ref name="White Dodo"/> No specimens of the solitaire were ever preserved.<ref name="Extinct Birds"/> The two individuals Carr<U+00E9> attempted to send to the [[Subsidiary structures of the Palace of Versailles|royal menagerie]] in France did not survive in captivity. Billiard claimed that [[Bertrand-Fran<U+00E7>ois Mah<U+00E9> de La Bourdonnais]] sent a "solitaire" to France from R<U+00E9>union around 1740. Since the R<U+00E9>union Ibis is believed to have gone extinct by this date, the bird may actually have been a [[Rodrigues Solitaire]].<ref name="Lost Land"/>

The only contemporary writer who referred specifically to "Dodos" inhabiting [[R<U+00E9>union]] was the Dutch sailor [[Willem Ysbrandtszoon Bontekoe]], though he did not mention their colouration:<ref>{{cite book

In the 1770s, the French naturalist [[Comte de Buffon]] stated that the Dodo inhabited both [[Mauritius]] and R<U+00E9>union. It is unclear why he included R<U+00E9>union, but he also combined accounts about the Rodrigues Solitaire and a third bird ("Oiseau de Nazareth", now thought to be a Dodo) under the same section.<ref name="White Dodo"/> English naturalist [[Hugh Edwin Strickland]] discussed the old descriptions of the R<U+00E9>union Solitaire in his 1848 book ''The Dodo and Its Kindred'', and concluded it was distinct from the Dodo and Rodrigues Solitaire.<ref name="Strickland">{{cite book

[[File:Reunion Solitaire.png|thumb|upright|Restoration of the R<U+00E9>union Solitaire based on Dubois' description, by Frederick William Frohawk, 1907]] 
In 1856, William Coker announced the discovery of a 17th-century "[[Persia]]n" painting of a white Dodo among [[waterfowl]], which he had been shown in England. The artist was later identified as Pieter Withoos, and many prominent 19th-century naturalists subsequently assumed the image depicted the white solitaire of R<U+00E9>union, a possibility originally proposed by ornithologist [[John Gould]]. Simultaneously, several similar paintings of white Dodos by Pieter Holsteyn II were discovered in the Netherlands.<ref name="White Dodo"/> In 1869, the English ornithologist [[Alfred Newton]] argued that the Withoos painting and engraving in Bontekoe's memoir depicted a living R<U+00E9>union Dodo that had been brought to Holland, while explaining its blunt beak as a result of [[beak trimming]] to prevent it from injuring humans. He also brushed aside the inconsistencies between the illustrations and descriptions, especially the long, thin beak implied by one contemporary account.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1111/j.1096-3642.1868.tb00581.x}}</ref> 

Newton's words particularly cemented the validity of this connection among contemporary peers, and several of them expanded on his views.<ref name="White Dodo"/> Dutch zoologist [[Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans]] suggested that the discrepancies between the paintings and the old descriptions were due to the paintings showing a female, and that the species was therefore [[sexually dimorphic]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.2307.2F4073093}}</ref> [[Walter Rothschild]] claimed the yellow wings might have been due to [[albinism]] in this particular specimen, since the old descriptions described these as black.<ref name="Rothschild">{{Cite book

Some believed the solitaire of the old descriptions was rather a species similar to the Rodrigues Solitaire.<ref name="White Dodo"/> Rothschild commissioned British artist [[Frederick William Frohawk]] to restore the R<U+00E9>union Solitaire as both a white Dodo, based on the Withoos painting, and as a distinct bird based on Dubois' description, for his 1907 book ''[[Extinct Birds (Rothschild book)|Extinct Birds]]''.<ref name="Rothschild"/> In 1953, the Japanese writer Masauji Hachisuka went as far as referring to the white Dodos of the paintings as ''Victoriornis imperialis'', and the solitaire of the accounts as ''Ornithaptera solitarius''.<ref name="de Lozoya"/>

===Recent interpretation===
Until the late 1980s, belief in the existence of a white Dodo on R<U+00E9>union was the orthodox view, and only a few researchers doubted the connection between the solitaire accounts and the Dodo paintings. They cautioned that no conclusions could be made without solid evidence such as fossils, and that nothing indicated that the white Dodos in the paintings had anything to do with R<U+00E9>union. In 1970, [[Robert W. Storer]] predicted that if any such remains were found, they would not belong to Raphinae, or even columbidae.<ref name="White Dodo"/><ref name =Greenway>{{cite book

The first subfossil bird remains on R<U+00E9>union were found in 1974, and assigned to a [[stork]], ''[[Ciconia]]'' sp. In 1987, subfossils of a recently extinct species of [[ibis]] from R<U+00E9>union were described as ''Borbonibis latipes'', and thought related to the [[bald ibises]] of the genus ''Geronticus''.<ref name="Borbonibis">{{cite journal

Cheke to suggest to one of the describers, Francois Moutou, that the subfossils may have been of the R<U+00E9>union Solitaire.<ref name="White Dodo"/> This suggestion was published by the describers of ''Borbonibis'' in 1995, and they also reassigned it to the genus ''[[Threskiornis]]'', now combined with the [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''{{lang|la|solitarius}}'' from de S<U+00E9>lys-Longchamps' 1848 binomial for the solitaire. The authors pointed out that the contemporary descriptions matched the appearance and behaviour of an ibis more than a member of the Raphinae, especially since a fragment of a comparatively short and straight ibis mandible was discovered in 1994, and because ibis remains were abundant in some localities; it would be strange if contemporary writers never mentioned such a relatively common bird, whereas they mentioned most other species subsequently known from fossils.<ref name="Ibis"/>
[[File:Landscape with Orpheus and the animals.png|thumb|left|alt=Painting of various animals and people in a forest, including a whitish Dodo|Roelant Savery painting with a whitish Dodo in the lower right, 1611]]
The possible origin of the 17th-century white Dodo paintings has also recently been examined by biologist Arturo Valledor de Lozoya in 2003, and independently by experts of Mascarene fauna Anthony Cheke and [[Julian Hume]] in 2004. The Withoos and Holsteyn paintings are clearly derived from each other, and Withoos likely copied his Dodo from one of Holsteyn's works, since these were probably produced at an earlier date. All later white Dodo pictures are thought to be based on these paintings. According to the aforementioned writers, it appears these pictures were themselves derived from a whitish Dodo in a previously unreported painting containing, called ''Landscape with Orpheus and the animals'', produced by Roelant Savery circa 1611. The Dodo was apparently based on a stuffed specimen then in [[Prague]]; a ''walghvogel'' (old Dutch for Dodo) described as having a "dirty off-white colouring" was mentioned in an inventory of specimens in the Prague collection of the [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II]] to whom Savery was contracted at the time (1607<U+2013>1611). Savery's several later Dodo images all show greyish birds, possibly because he had by then seen a normal specimen. Cheke and Hume concluded the painted specimen was white due to albinism, and that this peculiar feature was the reason it was collected from Mauritius and brought to Europe.<ref name="White Dodo">{{cite doi|10.3366/anh.2004.31.1.57}}</ref> Valledor de Lozoya instead suggested that the light plumage was a juvenile trait, a result of bleaching of old taxidermy specimens, or simply due to artistic license.<ref name="de Lozoya">{{Cite doi|10.1093/jhc/15.2.201}}</ref>

===Evolution===
The volcanic island of R<U+00E9>union is only three million years old, whereas Mauritius and Rodrigues, with each their flightless raphine species, are eight to ten million years old, and it is unlikely that either bird would have been capable of flying after five or more million years of adapting to the islands. Therefore it is unlikely that R<U+00E9>union could have been colonised by flightless birds from these islands, and only flighted species on the island have relatives there.<ref name="White Dodo"/> 3 million years is enough time for flightless and weak flying abilities to have evolved in bird species on R<U+00E9>union itself. But such species would have been wiped out by the eruption of the [[volcano]] [[Piton des Neiges]] between 300,000 and 180,000 years ago. Most recent species would therefore likely be descendants of animals which had recolonised the island from Africa or Madagascar after this event, which is not enough time for a bird to become flightless.<ref name="Avifauna"/> 

In 1995, morphological study suggested the closest extant relatives of the R<U+00E9>union Ibis are the [[African Sacred Ibis]] (''T. aethiopicus'') of [[Africa]] and the [[Straw-necked Ibis]] (''T. spinicollis'') of [[Australia]].<ref name="Ibis">{{cite doi|10.1038/373568a0}}</ref> It has also been suggested that it was closest to the [[Malagasy Sacred Ibis]] (''T. bernieri''), and therefore of ultimately African origin.<ref name="Lost Land"/>

==Description==
[[File:R<U+00E9>union Solitaire.jpg|thumb|[[Hermann Schlegel]]'s 1854 ibis or stork-like restoration, based on Dubois' description]] 
Contemporary accounts described the species as having white and grey plumage merging into yellow, black wing tips and tail feathers, a long neck and legs, and limited flight capabilities.<ref name="Fuller Dodo"/> [[Sieur Dubois]]' 1674 account is the most detailed contemporary description of the bird,<ref name="Rothschild"/> here as translated by Hugh Strickland in 1848:
{{Quotation|''Solitaires''. These birds are so called because they always go alone. They are the size of a large Goose, and are white, with the tips of the wings and tail black. The tail feathers resemble those of an Ostrich; the neck is long, and the beak is like that of a Woodcock, but larger; the legs and feet like those of Turkeys. This bird has recourse to running, as it flies but very little.<ref name="Strickland"/>}}
[[File:African Sacred Ibis RWD.jpg|thumb|left|A close extant relative, the [[African Sacred Ibis]], which has similar plumage]] 
The plumage colouration mentioned is similar to that of the related African Sacred Ibis and Straw-necked Ibis, which are also mainly white and glossy black. In the reproductive season, the ornamental feathers on the back and wing tips of the African Sacred Ibis look similar to the feathers of an [[ostrich]], which echoes Dubois' description. Likewise, a subfossil lower jaw found in 1994 showed that the bill of the R<U+00E9>union Ibis was relatively short and straight for an ibis, which corresponds with Dubois' [[woodcock]] comparison.<ref name="Ibis"/> Cheke and Hume have suggested that the French word (''b<U+00E9>casse'') from Dubois' original description, usually translated to "woodcock", could also mean [[oystercatcher]], another bird with a long, straight, but slightly more robust, bill. They have also pointed out that the last sentence is mistranslated, and actually means the bird could be caught by running after it.<ref name="White Dodo"/> The bright colouration of the plumage mentioned by some authors may refer to [[iridescence]], as seen in the Straw-necked Ibis.<ref name="Avian extinctions"/>

Subfossils of the R<U+00E9>union Ibis show that it was more robust, likely much heavier, and had a larger head than the African Sacred and Straw-necked Ibises. It was nonetheless similar to them in most features. Rough protuberances on the wing bones of the R<U+00E9>union Ibis are similar to those of birds that use their wings in combat. It was perhaps flightless, but this has not left significant [[osteological]] traces; no complete skeletons have been collected, but of the known [[Chest|pectoral]] elements, only one feature indicates reduction in flight capability. The [[coracoid]] is elongated and the [[radius]] and [[ulna]] are robust, as in flighted birds, but a particular [[foramen]] between a [[metacarpal]] and the [[alular]] is otherwise only known from flightless birds, such as some [[ratites]], [[penguins]], and several extinct species.<ref name="Avifauna">{{Cite journal

==Behaviour and ecology==
[[File:Threskiornis spinicollis - Centenary Lakes.jpg|thumb|The [[Straw-necked Ibis]], a close relative which inhabits wetlands, like most ibises]] 
The species was termed a land-bird by Dubois, so it did not live in typical ibis habitats such as [[wetlands]]. It has been proposed that this is because the ancestors of the bird colonised R<U+00E9>union before swamps had developed, and had therefore became adapted to the available habitats. They were perhaps prevented from colonising Mauritius as well due to the presence of [[Red Rail]]s there, which may have occupied a similar niche.<ref name="Lost Land"/> It appears to have lived in high altitudes, and perhaps had a limited distribution.<ref name="Extinct Birds">{{cite book

{{Quotation|The solitaires are the size of an average turkey cock, grey and white in colour. They inhabit the tops of mountains. Their food is only worms and filth, taken on or in the soil.<ref name="Lost Land"/>}}
The diet and mode of [[foraging]] described by Feuilley matches that of an ibis, whereas members of the Raphinae are known to have been [[frugivorous|fruit eaters]].<ref name="Ibis"/> Accounts by early visitors indicate the species was found near their landing sites, but they were found only in remote places by 1667. The bird may have survived in eastern lowlands until the 1670s. Though many late 1600s accounts state the bird was good food, Feuilley stated it tasted bad. This may be because it changed its diet when it moved to more rugged, higher terrain, to escape pigs that destroyed its nests; since it had limited flight capabilities, it probably nested on the ground.<ref name="Lost Land"/>

Many other [[endemic species]] of R<U+00E9>union became extinct after the arrival of man and the resulting disruption of the island's [[ecosystem]]. The R<U+00E9>union Ibis lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the [[Hoopoe Starling]], the [[Mascarene Parrot]], the [[R<U+00E9>union Parakeet]], the [[R<U+00E9>union Swamphen]], the [[R<U+00E9>union Owl]], the [[R<U+00E9>union Night Heron]], and the [[R<U+00E9>union Pink Pigeon]]. Extinct reptiles include the [[R<U+00E9>union giant tortoise]] and an undescribed ''[[Leiolopisma]]'' skink. The [[small Mauritian flying fox]] and the snail ''[[Tropidophora carinata]]'' lived on R<U+00E9>union and Mauritius, but vanished from both islands.<ref name="Lost Land"/>

==Extinction==
As R<U+00E9>union was populated by settlers, the R<U+00E9>union Ibis appears to have become confined to the tops of mountains. Introduced predators such as cats and rats took a toll. Overhunting also contributed and several contemporary accounts state the bird was widely hunted for food.<ref name="Extinct Birds"/> In 1625, John Tatton described the [[island tameness|tameness]] of the bird and how easy it was to hunt, as well as the large quantity consumed:
{{Quotation|There is store of land fowle both small and great, plenty of Doves, great Parrats, and such like; and a great fowle of the bignesse of a Turkie, very fat, and so short winged, that they cannot fly, being white, and in a manner tame: and so be all other fowles, as having not been troubled nor feared with shot. Our men did beat them down with sticks and stones. Ten men may take fowle enough to serve fortie men a day.<ref name="Rothschild"/>}}

In 1671, Melet described the slaughter of several types of birds on the island, and mentioned the culinary quality of this species:
{{Quotation|There are birds in such great confusion and so tame that it is not necessary to go hunting with firearms, they can so easily be killed with a little stick or rod. During the five or six days that we were allowed to go into the woods, so many were killed that our General [de La Haye] was constrained to forbid anyone going beyond a hundred paces from the camp for fear the whole quarter would be destroyed, for one needed only to catch one bird alive and make it cry out, to have in a moment whole flocks coming to perch on people, so that often without moving from one spot one could kill hundreds. But, seeing that it would have been impossible to wipe out such a huge quantity, permission was again given to kill, which gave great joy to everyone, because very good fare was had at no expense&nbsp;... (A)nother sort of bird called solitaires which are very good (to eat) and the beauty of their plumage is most fascinating for the diversity of bright colours that shine on their wing and around their necks.<ref name="Extinct Birds"/>}}
The last definite account of the "solitaire" of R<U+00E9>union was Feuilley's from 1708, indicating that the species probably became extinct sometime early in the century.<ref name="Extinct Birds"/> In the 1820s, Louis Henri de Freycinet asked an old slave about ''drontes'' (old Dutch word for Dodo), and was told the bird existed around [[Saint-Joseph, R<U+00E9>union|Saint-Joseph]] when his father was an infant. This would perhaps be a century earlier, but the account may be unreliable. Cheke and Hume suspect that feral cats initially hunted wildlife in the lowlands and later turned to higher inland areas, which were probably the last stronghold of the R<U+00E9>union Ibis, as they were unreachable by pigs. The species is thought to have been driven to extinction around 1710<U+2013>1715.<ref name="Lost Land"/>
