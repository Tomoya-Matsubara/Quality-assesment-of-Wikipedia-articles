The '''Mission-Aransas National Estuarine Research Reserve''' is a large contiguous complex of [[wetland]], terrestrial, and marine environments on the [[Texas Coastal Bend]] in the [[United States]]. Named for the two major rivers that flow into the area, the reserve contains public and private lands and waters. The land is primarily [[Western Gulf coastal grasslands|coastal prairie]] with unique [[oak]] motte habitats. The wetlands include [[Riparian zone|riparian]] habitat, [[freshwater marsh]]es, and [[Salt marsh|saltwater marshes]]. Within the water areas, the bays are large, open, and include extensive [[Mudflat|tidal flats]], [[seagrass]] meadows, [[mangrove]]s, and [[oyster]] [[reef]]s. These unique and diverse [[Estuary|estuarine]] habitats in the western [[Gulf of Mexico]] support a host of endangered and threatened species including the endangered [[Whooping Crane]]. 

Traditional activities within the proposed reserve include [[boating]], [[fishing]], [[hunting]], oil and gas extraction, [[shellfish]] harvesting, camping and recreational activities. Despite a long history of human uses and its close proximity to the city of [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]], the reserve is relatively rural and pristine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nerrs.noaa.gov/Reserve.aspx?ResID=MAR  |title=Mission-Aransas, TX |work=NERRS Reserves |publisher=National Estuarine Research Reserve System |accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref>
