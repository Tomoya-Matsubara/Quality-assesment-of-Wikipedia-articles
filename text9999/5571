'''Jonas Gustavsson''' ({{pron-en|<U+02CC>ju<U+02D0>n<U+0251><U+02D0>s <U+02C8><U+0261><U+028A>st<U+0251><U+02D0>vs<U+0252>n}} (born October 24, 1984), popularly nicknamed '''''The Monster''''' due to his stature, is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[ice hockey]] [[goaltender]] currently playing for the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).

==Playing career==

===Sweden===
Gustavsson started his professional career with [[AIK Hockey|AIK]] in 2002 and played with them until 2007. He then moved to [[F<U+00E4>rjestads BK|F<U+00E4>rjestad]] in [[Elitserien]]. He was the top goalie in [[2008<U+2013>09 Elitserien season|2008<U+2013>09]], when he posted a 1.96 [[goals against average]] and a [[save percentage]] of .932 in the regular season. In the playoffs, he aced the statistics, posting a 1.03 goals against average, a save percentage of .961, and five shutouts in 13 games. Having allowed only 14 goals in 13 playoff games, he led F<U+00E4>rjestad to the league title.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
On July 7, 2009, Gustavsson ended weeks of speculation by signing a one-year contract for [[United States dollar|US $]]810,000 (plus a $90,000 signing bonus) with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].<ref name="ESPNarticle1">{{ cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=4310709 |title=Gustavsson Signs with Maple Leafs|last=LeBrun|first=Pierre|accessdate=21 July 2009|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2009-07-07}} </ref>

"I'm going to try to steal as many games from [[Vesa Toskala]] as I can," Gustavsson said in a phone interview from Sweden. "I'm a goalie and I want to play... I know the best goalie gets the ice time and if I play good I'm going to get the chance. We will be good teammates and try to push ourselves, but my goal is to be the number one goalie." When asked about the intensity of playing in [[Toronto]], he replied: "For the most part, I like [the attention]. It doesn't matter what people say about me, I know if I play good or if I play bad... I like when lots of people are getting involved. In Toronto, everybody talks about hockey. I like to be in the heat."<ref> {{ cite news |url=http://www.torontosun.com/sports/hockey/2009/07/07/10050056.html |title=Leafs Cage Monster|last=Longley |first=Rob|accessdate=21 July 2009|publisher=Toronto Sun|date=2009-07-07}} </ref> 

Gustavsson endured a setback on the first day of camp, traced to a heart condition that required an ablation surgery process. After overcoming a groin strain, he was diagnosed with a racing heart en route to a road shutout against the Montreal Canadiens on December 1, which led to a second ablation. Gustavsson was also dealing with a new country, new language, new team and the different NHL rink size and rules. Through it all, he gradually improved his game and was named to the [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010]] [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Swedish Olympic team]]. He won seven straight starts in March to tie the Leafs<U+2019> club record for the longest winning streak by a rookie goaltender. Gustavsson finished the season with a 16-15-9 record with a 2.87 GAA and a .902 save percentage. 

Gustavsson made his NHL debut with Toronto on October 3, 2009 against the [[Washington Capitals]].

On October 26, 2009, Gustavsson recorded his first NHL win against the [[Anaheim Ducks]], making 25 saves on 28 shots in a 6<U+2013>3 win.

On December 1, 2009, Gustavsson left after the first period in a game versus the [[Montreal Canadiens]] with a [[heart murmur]].

Gustavsson recorded his first NHL [[shutout]] with a 2<U+2013>0 win over the [[Boston Bruins]] on December 19, 2009. 

Gustavsson recorded his first point in the NHL with an assist on March 13, 2010.

Gustavsson received Radio Frequency ablation to treat a reentrant tachycardia in 2009.<ref>http://beavermedic.wordpress.com/2010/03/29/jonas-gustavsson-syndrome/</ref>

On April 6, 2010, the Toronto chapter of the Professional Hockey Writers Association announced Gustavsson as the Maple Leafs nominee for the [[2009<U+2013>10 NHL season|2010]] [[Bill Masterton Trophy]], awarded for "perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey".<ref>http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=524128&navid=DL|TOR|home</ref>

After becoming a [[restricted free agent]] in the summer, Gustavsson agreed a two-year extension with the Leafs on April 15, 2010, with an average salary of $1.35m per year.<ref>[http://tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=318119]</ref>
