'''''Buffy the Vampire Slayer''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Cult_television|cult]] [[television series]] that first aired from [[March 10]], [[1997]] until [[May 20]], [[2003]]. Writer-director [[Joss Whedon]] created the concept and TV series under his production tag, [[Mutant Enemy Productions|Mutant Enemy]]. The series follows the life of [[Buffy Summers|Buffy Anne Summers]] (played by [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]), the latest in a line of young women chosen to battle against [[Vampire (Buffyverse)|vampires]], [[Demon (Buffyverse)|demons]] and the forces of darkness. Like previous [[Slayer (Buffyverse)|slayers]], Buffy is aided by a [[Watcher (Buffyverse)|Watcher]] who guides and trains her. Unlike her predecessors, Buffy surrounds herself with a circle of loyal friends who become known as the "[[Scooby Gang]]".

The series usually reached between two and four million viewers on original airings.<ref>Wahoske, Matthew J., "[http://home.insightbb.com/~wahoskem/buffy.html Nielsen Ratings For Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel, And Firefly]", ''Insightbb.com'' ([[2004]]).</ref> Although such [[Nielsen Ratings|ratings]] are lower than successful shows on the "big four" networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], [[CBS]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]),<ref>"[http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Orders/2001/fcc01133.txt The Dual Network Rule.]", ''Federal Communications Commission'' (May 15, 2001): "the four major broadcast networks are unique among the media in their ability to reach a wide audience"</ref>  they were a success for the relatively new and smaller [[Warner Brothers Network]].<ref>Kaiser Family Foundation "[http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf#search=%22%20Dawson's%20Creek%2C%20Buffy%20is%20often%20associated%20with%20the%20early%20success%20of%20the%20Warner%20Brothers%20Network.%22 Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8<U+2013>18 Year Olds]", ''Kff.org'' ([[March 9]], [[2005]]).

==Production==
=== Origins===

Writer Joss Whedon developed ''Buffy'' to invert the Hollywood formula of "the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every [[horror film|horror movie]]."<ref name=blondegirl>Billson, Anne, ''[["Buffy the Vampire Slayer" (BFI TV Classics S.)]]''. [[British Film Institute]] ([[December 5]], [[2005]]), pp24<U+2013>25.</ref> Whedon wanted "to subvert that idea and create someone who was a hero."<ref name=blondegirl /> He explained:

{{cquote|The very first mission statement of the show, was the joy of female power: having it, using it, sharing it.<ref>Gottlieb, Allie, "[http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/09.26.02/buffy1-0239.html Buffy's Angels]", ''Metroactive.com'' ([[September 26]], [[2002]]).</ref>}}

The concept was first visited through Whedon's script for the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|1992 movie, ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'']], which featured [[Kristy Swanson]] in the title role. The director saw it as a "pop culture comedy about what people think about vampires."<ref>Havens, Candace, ''[[Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy]]'' Benbella Books ([[May 1]], [[2003]]), p51. Fran Kuzui also discussed ''Buffy'' in Golden, Christopher, & Holder, Nancy, [[List of Buffyverse guidebooks#"Watcher's Guides"|''Watcher's Guide Vol. 1'']]. [[Simon & Schuster]] ([[October 1]], [[1998]]), pp247<U+2013>248.</ref> Whedon disagreed; "I had written this scary film about an empowered woman, and they turned it into a broad comedy. It was crushing."<ref>Havens, Candace, ''[[Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy]]'' Benbella Books ([[May 1]], [[2003]]), p23.</ref> The script was recognised within the industry,<ref>Brundage, James, [http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/ddb5490109a79f598625623d0015f1e4/d9787709f4d8f3e9882567bd0002949e?OpenDocument "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" film review].

Several years later, [[Gail Berman]], a Sandollar Productions executive approached Joss Whedon to develop his ''Buffy'' concept into a television series.<ref>Golden, Christopher, and Holder, Nancy, [[List of Buffyverse guidebooks#"Watcher's Guides"|''Watcher's Guide Vol. 1'']]. [[Simon & Schuster]] ([[October 1]], [[1998]]), pp249<U+2013>250</ref> Whedon explained that "They said, <U+2018>Do you want to do a show?<U+2019> And I thought, <U+2018>High school as a horror movie.<U+2019> And so the metaphor became the central concept behind ''Buffy'', and that<U+2019>s how I sold it."<ref>'Said, SF', "[http://www.shebytches.com/SFSaidgb.html Interview with Joss Whedon by SF Said]", ''Shebytches.com'' (2005).</ref> The supernatural elements in the series stood as metaphors for personal anxieties associated with [[adolescence]] and young adulthood.<ref>Wilcox, Rhonda, and Lavery, David, ''[[Fighting The Forces: What's At Stake In Buffy The Vampire Slayer?|Fighting The Forces]]'' ''Rowman & Littlefield'' (April 2002), "In the world of ''Buffy'' the problems that teenagers face become literal monsters<U+2026>", page xix</ref>   Whedon went on to write and partly fund a 25-minute [[Unaired pilot (Buffy episode)|unaired ''Buffy'' pilot]].<ref>Topping, Keith [[List of Buffyverse guidebooks#"Watcher's Guides"|"Slayer"]].

===Executive producers===
Joss Whedon was credited as [[executive producer]] throughout the run of the series.<ref name="whedonimdb">Various authors, "[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0923736/ Joss Whedon]", ''Internet Movie Database'' (updated 2006).</ref> For the first five seasons (1997-2001) he was also the [[show runner]]. This role involves serving as head writer and being responsible for every aspect of production. [[Marti Noxon]] took on the role for seasons six and seven (2001-2003), but Whedon continued to be involved with writing and directing ''Buffy'' alongside projects such as ''[[Angel (TV series)|Angel]]'', ''[[Fray]]'' and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]''.<ref name="whedonimdb" />  [[Fran Rubel Kuzui]] and her husband, [[Kaz Kuzui]] were credited as executive producers<ref>Various authors, "[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0476900/ Fran Kuzui]" and "[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0476901/ Kaz Kuzui]", ''Internet Movie Database'' (updated 2006).</ref> but were not heavily involved in the show. Their credit, rights and royalties over the franchise relate to their funding, producing and directing of the original movie version of ''Buffy''.<ref>Morgan, David, "[http://members.aol.com/morgands1/closeup/text/kuzui.htm Wide Angel Closeup: Director, Producer and Film Distributor Fran Rubel Kuzui]" ''Aol.com'' ([[June 10]], [[1992]]); "''Buffy'' was a film that I owned, this was the first time I owned a film". Also see Golden, Christopher, and Holder, Nancy, [[List of Buffyverse guidebooks#"Watcher's Guides"|''Watcher's Guide Vol. 1'']]. [[Simon & Schuster]] ([[October 1]], [[1998]]), "Gail Berman and Fran Kuzui came to [Whedon] to ask if he wanted to do the TV series" (p241). Also see ''Watcher's Guide Vol. 1'', pp246<U+2013>249.</ref>

===Writing===

Script-writing was done by [[Mutant Enemy Productions|Mutant Enemy]], a production company created by Whedon in 1997. The writers with the most writing credits include: [[Steven S. DeKnight]], [[Jane Espenson]], [[David Fury]], [[Drew Goddard]], [[Drew Greenberg]], [[Rebecca Rand Kirshner]], [[Marti Noxon]] and [[Doug Petrie]].<ref>Various authors, ''Internet Movie Database'' entries: [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0215299/ "Steven S. DeKnight"], [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0260870/ "Jane Espenson"], [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0299236/ "David Fury"], [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1206844/ "Drew Goddard"], [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0456990/ "Rebecca Rand Kirshner"], [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0637497/ "Marti Noxon"], [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0677956/ "Doug Petrie"]. [http://www.imdb.com ''Internet Movie Database''] ''Internet Movie Database'' (2006).</ref>

Jane Espenson has explained how scripts came together.<ref name="espensonwriting">Espenson, Jane, "[http://www.fireflyfans.net/firefly/espenson.htm The Writing Process]", ''Fireflyfans.net'' (2003).</ref> First, the writers talked about the emotional issues facing Buffy Summers and how she would confront them through her battle against evil supernatural. Then the episode's story was 'broken' into acts and scenes. Act breaks were designed as key moments to intrigue viewers so that they would stay with the episode through advertisements. The writers collectively "filled in" scenes surrounding these actbreaks for a more fleshed out story. A whiteboard marked their progress by mapping brief descriptions of each scene. Once 'breaking' was done, the credited author wrote an outline for the episode, which was checked by Whedon or Noxon. The writer wrote a full script which went through a quick rewrite from the show runner. The final article was used as the shooting script.

===Casting===

Four roles were cast before the series aired. The title role went to [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], who had appeared as Sydney Rutledge in ''[[Swan's Crossing]]'' and [[Kendall Hart]] in ''[[All My Children]]''.<ref name="smgimdb">Various authors, "[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001264/ Sarah Michelle Gellar]" ''Internet Movie Database'' (updated 2006).</ref> At age eighteen in 1995, Gellar had already won a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Younger Leading Actress in a Drama Series.<ref name="smgawards">Various authors, "[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001264/awards Awards for Sarah Michelle Gellar]" ''Internet Movie Database'' (updated 2006)</ref> In 1996 she was initially cast as [[Cordelia Chase]] during a week of auditioning.<ref name="smgauditions">Havens, Candace, ''[[Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy]]'' Benbella Books ([[May 1]], [[2003]]), p35<U+2013>36.</ref>

[[Anthony Stewart Head]] had already led a prolific acting and singing career<ref name="headimdb">Various authors, "[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0372117/ Anthony Head]" ''Internet Movie Database'' (updated 2006).</ref> but remained best known for a series of twelve coffee commercials with [[Sharon Maughan]] for [[Nescaf<U+00E9>]] Gold Blend.<ref>Golden, Christopher, & Holder, Nancy [[List of Buffyverse guidebooks#"Watcher's Guides"|''Watcher's Guide Vol. 1'']].

Unlike other ''Buffy'' regulars, [[Nicholas Brendon]] had little acting experience,<ref name="brendonimdb">Various authors, "[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0107183/ Nicholas Brendon]" ''Internet Movie Database'' (updated 2006).</ref> instead working various jobs <U+2014> including production assistant, plumber's assistant, veterinary janitor, food delivery, script delivery, day care counselor and waiter <U+2014> before deciding to break into acting to help him overcome a stutter.<ref>Anonymous, "[http://www.nickbrendon.com/bio.html NickBrendon.com; biography]" ''Nickbrendon.com'' (updated 2006).</ref><ref>Kappes, Serena,

[[Simon & Schuster]] ([[October 1]], [[1998]]), Brendon said "Four days. That's fast.", p199.</ref>

[[Alyson Hannigan]] was the last of the original four to be cast. Following her role in ''[[My Stepmother Is an Alien]]'',<ref name="hanniganimdb">Various authors, "[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004989/ Alyson Hannigan]" ''Internet Movie Database'' (updated 2006).</ref> she appeared in commercials and supporting roles on television shows throughout the early 1990s.<ref name="hanniganimdb" /> In 1996 the role of [[Willow Rosenberg]] was initially given to Riff Regan for the [[Unaired pilot (Buffy episode)|unaired ''Buffy'' pilot]] but Hannigan auditioned when the role was recast for the series proper. She described her approach to auditions in an interview through her approach to a particular moment: Willow tells Buffy that her [[Barbie]] doll was taken from her as a child, and Buffy asks if she ever got the Barbie back. "Willow's line was 'Most of it.' And so I thought I'm gonna make that a really happy thing. I was so proud that she got most of it back. That clued in on how I was going to play the rest of the scene. It defines the character."<ref>Golden, Christopher, and Holder, Nancy, [[List of Buffyverse guidebooks#"Watcher's Guides"|''Watcher's Guide Vol. 1'']]. [[Simon & Schuster]] ([[October 1]], [[1998]]), p202.</ref> Her approach subsequently helped her win the role.

===Broadcasting===
''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' first aired on [[March 10]], [[1997]] on the [[WB Television Network|WB]] network and played a key role in the growth of the [[Warner Brothers]] [[television network]] in its early years.<ref>See: Kaiser Family Foundation "[http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf#search=%22%20Dawson's%20Creek%2C%20Buffy%20is%20often%20associated%20with%20the%20early%20success%20of%20the%20Warner%20Brothers%20Network.%22 Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8<U+2013>18 Year Olds]", ''Kff.org'' ([[March 9]], [[2005]]), Littleton, Cynthia "[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/television/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000750211 A tale of two networks]", ''Hollywoodreporter.com'' ([[January 11]], [[2005]]), Schneider, Michael & Adalian, Josef, "[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117946199?cs=1&s=h&p=0 WB revisits glory days]", ''Variety.com'' (June 30, 2006).</ref>
After five seasons, it transferred to the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]) for its final two seasons. The show went into syndication in the U.S. on [[FX]]. In the United Kingdom, the entire series aired on [[BBC2]]. The BBC gave the show two time slots, an early-evening slot for a family-friendly version with violence and bad language cut out and a late-night uncut version.<ref>Burr, Vivien, "[http://www.slayage.tv/PDF/burr.pdf#search=%22buffy%20bbc%20cut%20edited%22 Buffy vs the BBC: Moral Questions and How to Avoid Them]" ''Slaye.tv'' (March 2003), p1.</ref> From the fourth season onwards, the BBC aired the show in anamorphic 16:9 widescreen format, but Whedon later said that ''Buffy'' had never intended to be viewed this way.<ref>"[http://www.videostoremag.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?sec_id=2&article_ID=5243 Angel Creator Joss Whedon Sees Evolution of TV Shows on DVD]" ''Video Store Mag'' (August 28, 2003).</ref>

The seventh and final season was originally broadcast on UPN during 2002-2003. Sarah Michelle Gellar explained to ''Entertainment Weekly'' why she decided not to sign on for an eighth season, "[When] we started to have such a strong year this year, I thought: 'This is how I want to go out, on top, at our best."<ref><small>"[http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,426799~10~0~gellarexplainswhybuffy,00.html Stake Out]", ''Entertainment Weekly'' ([[26 February]], [[2003]]).</ref> Whedon and UPN gave some considerations to production of a spin-off series that would not require Gellar, this included a possible [[Undeveloped Buffyverse productions#Faith the Vampire Slayer|Faith series]], but nothing became of those plans.<ref><small>Haberman, Lia, "[http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,11268,00.html A Buffy-less "Buffy"? Have Faith]", ''E! Online'' (Feb 11, 2003).</ref>

===Opening sequence===
The ''Buffy'' opening sequence provides credits early in each show. The music was performed by punk rock band [[Nerf Herder]]. The song sounds similar to a German pop song from the Eighties called "[[D<U+00F6>f#"Codo"|Codo]]" by "[[D<U+00F6>f]]", but Nerf Herder have said that thay had "never heard of D<U+00F6>f", and the similarity was coicidental.<ref>"[http://whedonesque.com/comments/11527 Before Nerf Herder, the original Buffy theme: "Codo" by 1980s Austrian band, D<U+00F6>f.]" ''Whedonesque.com'' (October 2006).</ref> In the DVD commentary for the [[Welcome to the Hellmouth (Buffy episode)|first ''Buffy'' episode]], Whedon said his decision to go with Nerf Herder's theme was influenced by cast member [[Alyson Hannigan]] who had made him listen to the band's music.<ref>''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' first season DVD set. ''20th Century Fox'' (region 2, 2000), disc one.</ref> Janet Halfyard, in her essay "Music, Gender, and Identity in ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ''Angel''", describes the opening:

{{cquote|It begins with the sound of an organ, accompanied by a wolf<U+2019>s howl, with a visual image of a flickering night sky overlaid with unintelligible archaic script, the associations with both the silent era and films such as [[Nosferatu]] and with the conventions of the [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer House of Horror]] and horror in general are unmistakable.<ref name="halfyard">Halfyard, Janet K. "[http://www.slayage.tv/essays/slayage4/halfyard.htm Love, Death, Curses and Reverses (in F minor): Music, Gender, and Identity in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel]", ''[http://www.slayage.tv Slayage.tv]'' (December 2001).</ref>}}

But the theme changes; "[The opening sequence] removes itself from the sphere of 1960s and 70s horror by replaying the same motif, the organ now supplanted by an aggressively strummed electric guitar, relocating itself in modern youth culture".<ref name="halfyard" /> This music is heard over images of a young cast involved in the action and turbulence of adolescence. The sequence provides a post-modern twist on the horror genre.<ref name="halfyard" />

===Music===

:''Main articles: [[Music (Buffyverse)|Music in ''Buffy'' and ''Angel'']] and [[Buffyverse tracklist|List of songs featured in ''Buffy'' and ''Angel'']]

''Buffy'' features a mix of [[Orchestration|original]], [[Indie (music)|indie]] and [[Pop music|pop]] music. The composers spent around seven days scoring between fourteen to thirty minutes of music for each episode.<ref name="dvdfeature">"Buffy: Inside the Music" from "[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer DVDs#Season 4|Buffy the Vampire Slayer Complete Fourth Season DVD set]] ''20th Century Fox'' ([[13 May]] [[2002]]), disc three</ref> [[Christophe Beck]] revealed that the [[List of Buffyverse cast and crew#Composers|''Buffy'' composers]] used computers and synthesizers and were limited to recording one or two 'real' samples. Despite this, their goal was to produce "dramatic" orchestration that would stand up to film scores.<ref name="dvdfeature">"Buffy: Inside the Music" from "[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer DVDs#Season 4|Buffy the Vampire Slayer Complete Fourth Season DVD set]] ''20th Century Fox'' ([[13 May]] [[2002]]), disc three</ref>

Alongside the score, most episodes featured indie rock music, usually at the characters' venue of choice, [[The Bronze]]. ''Buffy'' Music Supervisor John King explained that "we like to use unsigned bands", that "you would believe would play in this place."<ref name="dvdfeature">"Buffy: Inside the Music" from "[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer DVDs#Season 4|Buffy the Vampire Slayer Complete Fourth Season DVD set]] ''20th Century Fox'' ([[13 May]] [[2002]]), disc three</ref> For example, the group [[Four Star Mary]] were portrayed on screen by the fictional front [[Dingoes Ate My Baby]].  [[Pop music|Pop songs]] by famous artists were rarely featured prominently, but several episodes spotlighted the sounds of more famous artists such as [[Sarah McLachlan]] ("[[Surfacing (album)#Track listing|Full of Grace]]" and "[[Prayer of St. Francis]]") and [[Michelle Branch]] ("[[The Spirit Room#Singles|Goodbye to You]]"). The popularity of [[Music (Buffyverse)|music used in ''Buffy'']] has led to three soundtrack albums: ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Album|Buffy: The Album]]'', ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Radio Sunnydale - Music from the TV Series|Radio Sunnydale]]'' and ''[[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy episode)#CD track list|"Once More, with Feeling" Soundtrack]]''.

The Hellmouth serves as a [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] for a wide variety of evil creatures and supernatural phenomena, and lay beneath the [[Sunnydale High School library|school library]]. In addition to being an open-ended plot device, Joss Whedon has cited the Hellmouth and "High school as Hell" as one of the primary metaphors in creating the series.<ref>Yovanovich, Linda, "[http://www.smgfan.com/articles/b22.htm Young Blood]", ''Smgfan.com'', originally from ''OnSat'' ([[July 14]], [[1997]]), Whedon said: "[High school as hell] was always the basis of the show.

But you know when I thought of the idea of the horror movies as a metaphor for high school, [I said] okay this is something that will work week to week."</ref>

The high school used in the first three seasons is actually [[Torrance High School]], in [[Torrance, California]].<ref name="torrence">Various authors, "[http://imdb.com/List?endings=on&&locations=Torrance%20High%20School,%20Torrance,%20California,%20USA&&heading=18;with+locations+including;Torrance%20High%20School,%20Torrance,%20California,%20USA Titles with locations including Torrance High School]", ''Internet Movie Database'' (updated 2006).</ref> The school exterior is used in other television shows and movies, most notably ''[[Beverly Hills 90210]]'', ''[[Bring It On]]'', ''[[She's All That]]'' (explaining Sarah Michelle Gellar's appearance in the cafeteria scene of that movie), and the [[Parody|spoof]], ''[[Not Another Teen Movie]]''.<ref name="torrence" /> In addition to the high school and its library, scenes take place in the town's cemeteries, a local nightclub ([[The Bronze]]), and Buffy's home, where many of the characters live at various points in the series.

=== Format ===
{{spoiler}}

''Buffy'' is told in a [[serial|serialized]] format, with each episode telling a self-containing story while contributing to a larger [[story arc|storyline]], which on Buffy is broken down into season-long narratives marked by the rise and defeat of a powerful [[antagonist]], commonly referred to as the "[[Big and little bad|Big Bad]]". The show blends different [[genres]], including [[horror film|horror]], [[martial arts]], [[romance film|romance]], [[melodrama]], [[farce]], [[screwball comedy|comedy]], and even (in [[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy episode)|one episode]]) [[musical comedy]].

The series narrative revolves around Buffy and her friends (collectively dubbed the '[[Scooby Gang]]')  who struggle to balance the fight against [[supernatural]] evils with their complex social lives. A typical episode contains one or more [[villain]]s, or supernatural phenomena that is thwarted or defeated. Though elements and relationships are explored and ongoing subplots are included, the show focuses primarily on Buffy and her role as an [[archetype|archetypal]] [[hero]]. 

The most prominent monsters in the [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings|''Buffy'' bestiary]] are [[Vampire (Buffyverse)|vampire]]s, which are based on traditional myths, lore, and literary conventions. Buffy and her companions fight a wide variety of [[Demon (Buffyverse)|demon]]s, as well as [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Ghosts & Spirits|ghost]]s, [[Werewolf (Buffyverse)|werewolves]], [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Undead|zombie]]s, and [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Mortals Posing Particular Threat|ethically unsound humans]]. They frequently save the world from complete destruction. They use a combination of physical combat, [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], and detective-style investigation, and are guided by an extensive collection of ancient and mystical reference books. Hand-to-hand combat is chiefly undertaken by Buffy, Angel and later, Spike. Willow eventually becomes an adept [[Witch (Buffyverse)|witch]], while Giles contributes his extensive knowledge of demonology and supernatural lore.

=== Inspirations and metaphors ===
During the first year of the series, Whedon described the show as "''[[My So-Called Life]]'' meets ''[[The X-Files]]''."<ref>"[http://www.cityofangel.com/council/joss.html Joss Whedon: Executive Producer of Angel]", ''Cityofangel.com'' (2006). Also see Flowers, Phoebe, "[http://www.tvshows.nu/article.php3?id_article=4984 Sixth season was last great one for Buffy - Dvd Review]", ''Tvshows.nu'' ([[16 June]] [[2004]]). Executive Producer [[Marti Noxon]] stated: "I'm basically trying to write ''My So-Called Life'' with vampires".</ref> ''My So-Called Life'' gave a sympathetic portrayal of teen anxieties, in contrast, ''The X-Files'' delivered a supernatural "monster of the week" storyline. Alongside these series, Whedon has cited cult film ''[[Night of the Comet]]'' as a "big influence",<ref>P., Ken, "[http://uk.filmforce.ign.com/articles/425/425492p6.html An Interview with Joss Whedon]", ''Ign.com'' ([[June 23]], [[2003]]), web-page 6.</ref> and credited the ''[[X-Men]]'' character [[Kitty Pryde]] as a significant influence on the character of Buffy.<ref>Whedon, Joss "[http://whedonesque.com/comments/3095 Kitty Pryde influenced Buffy]" ''Whedonesque.com'' ([[February 27]], [[2004]]).</ref>   The authors of unofficial guidebook ''[[List of Buffyverse guidebooks#"Dusted"|Dusted]]'' point out that the series was often a [[pastiche]], borrowing elements from previous horror novels, movies and short stories and from such common literary stock as folklore and mythology.<ref>Miles, Lawrence, ''[[List of Buffyverse guidebooks#"Dusted"|Dusted]]'', ''Mad Norwegian Press'' (November 2003).</ref> Nevitt & Smith describe ''Buffy'''s use of pastiche as "post modern Gothic".<ref>Nevitt, Lucy, & Smith, Andy William, "[http://www.refractory.unimelb.edu.au/journalissues/vol2/nevSmith.pdf#search=%22buffy%20postmodern%20spin%20pastiche%20-wikipedia%20-encyclopedia%22 Family Blood is always the Sweetest: The Gothic Transgressions of Angel/Angelusby]", ''Refractory: a Journal of Entertainment Media'' Vol. II (March, 2003): Nevitt and Smith bring attention to ''Buffy''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s use of pastiche: "Multiple pastiche without enabling commentary is doubtless self-cancelling, yet, at the same time, each element of pastiche calls into temporary being what and why it imitates"</ref> For example, the [[Adam (Buffyverse)|Adam]] character parallels the ''[[Frankenstein]]'' monster, the episode "[[Bad Eggs (Buffy episode)|Bad Eggs]]" parallels ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'', and so on.

''Buffy'' episodes include a deeper meaning or [[metaphor]] as well. Whedon explained, "We think very carefully about what we're trying to say emotionally, politically, and even philosophically while we're writing it<U+2026> it really is, apart from being a pop-culture phenomenon, something that is deeply layered textually episode by episode."<ref>Shuttleworth, Ian, "[http://web.archive.org/web/20040202205347/http://news.ft.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=FT.com/StoryFT/FullStory&c=StoryFT&cid=1059479741556 Bite me, professor]" ''Financial Times'', citing interview from ''New York Times'' ([[September 11]], [[2003]]).</ref> Academics Wilcox and Lavery provide examples of how a few episodes deal with real life issues turned into supernatural metaphors:

{{cquote|In the world of ''Buffy'' the problems that teenagers face become literal monsters. A mother can take over her daughter's life ("[[Witch (Buffy episode)|Witch]]"); a strict stepfather-to-be really is a heartless machine ("[[Ted (Buffy episode)|Ted]]"); a young [[lesbian]] fears that her nature is demonic ("[[Goodbye Iowa (Buffy episode)|Goodbye Iowa]]" and "[[Family (Buffy episode)|Family]]"); a girl who has sex with even the nicest-seeming guy may discover that he afterwards becomes a monster ("[[Innocence (Buffy episode)|Innocence]]").<ref>Wilcox, Rhonda, and Lavery, David, ''[[Fighting The Forces: What's At Stake In Buffy The Vampire Slayer?|Fighting The Forces]]'' ''Rowman & Littlefield'' (April 2002), page xix.</ref>
}}

The love affair between the vampire [[Angel (vampire)|Angel]] and Buffy was fraught with metaphors. For example, their night of passion cost the vampire his [[soul]]. [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] said: "That's the ultimate metaphor. You sleep with a guy and he turns bad on you."<ref>"[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/05/20/entertainment/main554813.shtml Bye-Bye Buffy]", ''Cbsnews.com'' ([[May 20]], [[2003]]).</ref>

{{main|Buffy the Vampire Slayer plot summary|List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes}}
{{spoiler-about|the entire series of Buffy the Vampire Slayer}}
[[List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes#Season 1 (1997)|The first season]] exemplifies the "high school as hell" concept. Buffy Summers has just moved to [[Sunnydale]] and hopes to escape her [[Slayer (Buffyverse)|slayer]] duties.  Her plans are complicated by [[Rupert Giles]], her new [[Watcher (Buffyverse)|Watcher]], who reminds her of the inescapable presence of evil. [[Sunnydale High]] is built atop a [[Hellmouth (Buffyverse)|Hellmouth]], a portal to demon dimensions that attracts supernatural phenomena to the area.  Buffy meets two schoolmates who will help fight evil through the series, but they must first prevent [[Master (Buffyverse)|an ancient and especially threatening vampire]] from opening the Hellmouth and unleashing Hell on Earth.

The emotional stakes are raised in the [[List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes#Season 2 (1997 <U+2013> 1998)|second season]]. Buffy consummates her relationship with her vampire lover [[Angel (Buffyverse)|Angel]], unknowingly completing a curse and taking away his soul. He once more becomes a sadistic killer seeking to destroy the world. Buffy is forced to kill him, and leaves Sunnydale shattered.

After attempting a new life in [[Los Angeles]], Buffy returns to town in the [[List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes#Season 3 (1998 <U+2013> 1999)|third season]]. She is soon confronted with an [[Faith Lehane|unstable slayer]], Angel (again), and an often affable but definitely [[Mayor Richard Wilkins III|evil mayor]]'s plans for Graduation Day.

The [[List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes#Season 4 (1999 <U+2013> 2000)|fourth season]] sees Buffy and Willow enroll at [[University of California|UC]] Sunnydale while Xander joins the workforce. Willow explores her [[lesbianism|sexuality]] with [[Tara Maclay|another witch]], while Buffy begins dating [[Riley Finn|a student]] who is a member of [[The Initiative (Buffyverse)|The Initiative]], a top-secret military installation based beneath the UC Sunnydale campus. They appear to be a well-meaning anti-demon operation, but [[Adam (Buffyverse)|a secret project]] goes horribly wrong. The season also marked the first year in which Joss Whedon oversaw other TV series.

During the [[List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes#Season 5 (2000 <U+2013> 2001)|fifth season]], an [[Glory (Buffyverse)|exiled Hell-God]] searches for a 'key' that will allow her to return to her home dimension. The 'key' has been turned into [[Dawn Summers|human form]] as Buffy's younger sister. The Hell-God eventually discovers the truth and kidnaps Dawn. Buffy sacrifices herself to save Dawn and the world.

Buffy's friends resurrect her through a powerful spell in the [[List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes#Season 6 (2001 <U+2013> 2002)|sixth season]]. Buffy returns from Heaven and finds a job at a fast food restaurant. Her friends are unaware of her inner turmoils as they face their own troubles: Xander leaves his fianc<U+00E9>e at the altar and Willow becomes addicted to magic. When Willow's girlfriend is killed by a deranged murderer, Willow descends into darkness and begins a rampage.

The instability caused by Buffy's revival enables the [[First Evil]] to amass an army of powerful vampires against humankind during the [[List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes#Season 7 (2002 <U+2013> 2003)|final season]]. Willow invokes a magical spell that activates all potential Slayers in the world as the Scooby Gang defeats evil once more.

== Characters ==

=== Main characters ===

[[Buffy Anne Summers]] (played by [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]) is "[[Slayer (Buffyverse)|the Slayer]]," one in a long line of young women chosen by fate to battle evil forces. This mystic calling endows her with a limited degree of [[clairvoyance]], usually in the form of prophetic dreams, as well as dramatically increased physical strength, endurance, agility, intuition and ease of healing.

Buffy receives guidance from her [[Watcher (Buffyverse)|Watcher]], [[Rupert Giles]] (played by [[Anthony Stewart Head]]). Giles, rarely referred to by his first name, is a member of the [[Watchers' Council]], whose job is to train the Slayers. Giles researches the supernatural creatures that Buffy must face, offering insights into their origins and advice on how to kill them.

Buffy is also helped by friends she meets at [[Sunnydale High]]: [[Willow Rosenberg]] ([[Alyson Hannigan]]) and [[Xander Harris]] ([[Nicholas Brendon]]). Willow is originally a bookish wallflower; she provides a contrast to Buffy's outgoing personality, but shares the social isolation Buffy suffers after becoming a Slayer. As the series progresses, Willow becomes a more assertive character, a powerful witch, and a lesbian. In contrast Xander, with no supernatural skills, provides comic relief and a grounded perspective. (Buffy and Willow are the only characters who appear in all 144 episodes; Xander is missing in [[Conversations with Dead People (Buffy episode)|only one]].)

=== Supporting, recurring and minor characters ===
:''Main articles: [[List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters|List of ''Buffy'' characters]] and [[Minor characters of Buffy the Vampire Slayer|''Buffy'' minor characters]]

[[Image:Buffy the Vampire Slayer (image used by 20th Century Fox to promote Season 5 DVDs).JPG|thumb|''Buffy'' cast portray their characters (from right to left): [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]], [[Rupert Giles|Giles]], [[Buffy Anne Summers|Buffy]], [[Tara Maclay|Tara]], [[Dawn Summers|Dawn]], [[Spike (Buffyverse)|Spike]] (above), [[Xander Harris|Xander]] (below), [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]], and [[Riley Finn|Riley]].]]

The cast of characters grew over the course of the series. Buffy first arrives in Sunnydale with her mother, [[Joyce Summers]] (portrayed by [[Kristine Sutherland]]) who functions as an anchor of normality in the Scoobies' lives, even after she learns of Buffy's role in the supernatural world ("[[Becoming, Part Two (Buffy episode)|Becoming II]]"). Buffy's teenage sister [[Dawn Summers]] ([[Michelle Trachtenberg]]) does not appear until the fifth season.

The vampire [[Angel (Buffyverse)|Angel]] (portayed by [[David Boreanaz]]) is Buffy's love interest throughout the first three seasons. He leaves Buffy to make amends for his sins and search for redemption in his own spin-off, ''[[Angel (TV series)|Angel]]''.

At Sunnydale High, Buffy meets several other students willing to join her fight for good (alongside her friends Willow and Xander). [[Cordelia Chase]] ([[Charisma Carpenter]]), the archetypal shallow cheerleader, reluctantly becomes involved, and [[Daniel "Oz" Osbourne]] ([[Seth Green]]), a part-time rock guitarist, joins the [[Scooby Gang]] through his relationship with Willow. [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]] ([[Emma Caulfield]]), a former [[vengeance demon]] (Anyanka) who specialized in avenging scorned women, becomes Xander's lover after losing her powers, and joins the [[Scooby Gang]] in the fourth season.

In Buffy's senior year at school, she meets [[Faith Lehane|Faith]] ([[Eliza Dushku]]), the second current-slayer who was brought forth when [[Kendra|a previous slayer]] was killed by [[Drusilla (Buffyverse)|a vampire]]. Although she initially she fights on the side of good with Buffy and the rest of the Scooby gang, she comes to stand against them after accidentally killing a human.

Buffy gathers other allies: [[Spike (Buffyverse)|Spike]] ([[James Marsters]]), a vampire, is an old companion of Angelus and one of Buffy's major enemies in early seasons, although they later become allies and lovers. Spike is known for his [[Billy Idol]]-style [[Platinum Blonde|platinum blond]] hair and his black leather duster, stolen from a [[Nikki Wood|previous Slayer]]. [[Tara Maclay]] ([[Amber Benson]]) is a fellow member of Willow's [[Wicca]] group during the fourth season, and their friendship eventually turns into an ongoing love affair. Buffy also allies herself (personally and professionally) with [[Riley Finn]] ([[Marc Blucas]]), who is initially an operative in a military organization called "[[The Initiative (Buffyverse)|the Initiative]]" that uses science and military technology to hunt demons.

''Buffy'' featured dozens of recurring characters, both major and minor. For example the [[Big and little bad|Big Bad]] characters were featured for at least one season (e.g., [[Glorificus]] was a character that appeared in 13 episodes, spanning much of Season 5).<ref>"[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004456/filmoseries#tt0118276 Clare Kramer; TV Episode Filmography By Series]" ''Internet Movie Database'' (updated 2006).</ref> Similarly, characters that allied themselves to the [[Scooby Gang]] and characters which attended the same institutions were sometimes featured in multiple episodes.

== Spinoffs ==
''Buffy'' has inspired a range of official and unofficial works, including television shows, books, comics and games. This expansion of the series encouraged use of the term '[[Buffyverse]]' to describe the fictional universe in which ''Buffy'' and related stories take place.<ref><small>Walton, Andy, "[http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/05/19/buffy.sidebar/ Slang-age in the Buffyverse]", ''CNN'' (February 18, 2004 ).</ref> A timeline listing when these stories take place in relation to each other can be traced in a [[Buffyverse chronology]]. 

The franchise has inspired [[Buffyverse action figures|''Buffy'' action figures]] and merchandise such as [[Buffyverse Magazines (UK)|official ''Buffy/Angel'' magazines]] and [[List of Buffyverse guidebooks|''Buffy'' companion books]]. Eden Studios has published a [[Buffyverse role-playing games|''Buffy'' role-playing game]], while [[Score Entertainment]] has released a [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Collectible Card Game|''Buffy'' Collectible Card Game]].

=== ''Angel'' ===
{{main|Angel (TV series)}}

Buffy's perpetual love for the vampire-with-a-soul, [[Angel (Buffyverse)|Angel]], played by [[David Boreanaz]], is a recurrent theme in the first three seasons of the show.  The [[spin-off]] ''Angel'' was introduced in October, 1999, at the start of ''Buffy''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s fourth season. The series was created by ''Buffy'''s creator [[Joss Whedon|Whedon]] in collaboration with [[David Greenwalt]]. Like ''Buffy'', it was produced by the production company, [[Mutant Enemy]]. At times, it performed better in the [[Nielsen Ratings]] than its parent series.<ref>Wahoske, Matthew J., "[http://home.insightbb.com/~wahoskem/buffy.html Nielsen Ratings For Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel, And Firefly]", ''Insightbb.com'' (2004).</ref>  

The series was given a darker tone focussing on the ongoing trials of [[Angel (Buffyverse)|Angel]] in Los Angeles.  His character is tormented by guilt following the return of his soul, punishment for more than a century of murder and torture. During the first four seasons of the show, he works as a [[private detective]] in a fictionalized version of [[Los Angeles, California]], where he and his associates work to "help the helpless" and to restore the faith and "save the souls" of those who have lost their way. Typically, this mission involves doing battle with evil demons or demonically-allied humans (primarily the law firm [[Wolfram and Hart]]), Angel must also contend with his own violent nature. In the fifth season, the Senior Partners of Wolfram and Hart take a bold gamble in their campaign to corrupt Angel, giving him control of their Los Angeles office. Angel accepts the deal as an opportunity to fight evil from the inside.

In addition to Boreanaz, ''Angel'' inherited ''Buffy'' regulars [[Charisma Carpenter]] ([[Cordelia Chase]]) and [[Alexis Denisof]] ([[Wesley Wyndam-Price]]), followed later by [[Mercedes McNab]] ([[Harmony Kendall]]) and [[James Marsters]] ([[Spike (Buffyverse)|Spike]]). Several actors who played ''Buffy'' characters made guest appearances on ''Angel'', including [[Seth Green]] ([[Daniel "Oz" Osbourne|Oz]]), [[Sarah Michelle Geller]] ([[Buffy Summers]]), [[Eliza Dushku]] ([[Faith Lehane]]), [[Tom Lenk]] ([[Andrew Wells]]), and [[Alyson Hannigan]] ([[Willow Rosenberg]]). Angel continued to appear occasionally on ''Buffy''.

=== Expanded universe===
{{Main|Buffyverse canon|Buffyverse chronology|Buffyverse novels|Buffyverse comics}}

Outside of the TV series, the Buffyverse has been officially expanded and elaborated on by authors and artists in the so-called "Buffyverse [[Expanded Universe]]". The creators of these works may or may not keep to established continuity. Similarly, writers for the TV series were under no obligation to use information which had been established by the Expanded Universe, and sometimes contradicted such continuity.

The [[Buffy comics|''Buffy'' comics]] are published by [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]], which has retained the right to produce from 1998 onwards.<ref>Anonymous, "[http://www.darkhorse.com/profile/profile.php?sku=98-372+a Buffy the Vampire Slayer #1]" ''Dark Horse Comics'' ("Buffy the Vampire Slayer #1" released [[September 23]], [[1998]]).</ref> In [[2003]] Whedon wrote an eight-issue miniseries for [[Dark Horse Comics]] entitled ''[[Fray]]'', about a Slayer in the future. Following the publication of ''[[Tales of the Vampires]]'' in 2004, ''Dark Horse Comics'' halted publication on Buffyverse-related comics and graphic novels. The company has recently announced that Whedon will be producing another comic series with 20 issues beginning in March 2007, to pick up where the television show left off <U+2014> taking the place of an eighth canonical season.<ref>See Brown, Scott, "[http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2006/07/the_new_buffy_c.html First Look: The new 'Buffy' comic]", ''Entertainment Weekly'' (July 18, 2006), "[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0609/18/index.htm Buffy the Vampire Slayer Update]" ''Comics Continuum'' ([[September 18]], [[2006]]).</ref>

[[Pocket Books]] hold the license to produce [[Buffy novels|''Buffy'' novels]]. Since 1998, they have published more than 60 ''Buffy'' novels. These sometimes flesh out background information on characters; for example, ''[[Go Ask Malice]]'' provides lots of information about [[Faith Lehane]]. The most recent novels include ''[[Carnival of Souls (Buffy novel)|Carnival of Souls]]'' and ''[[Blackout (Buffy novel)|Blackout]]''. They continue to be released approximately every two months with upcoming books scheduled for [[Portal Through Time (Buffy novel)|October]]<!--"Portal Through Time" should be released October 2006--> and [[Bad Bargain (Buffy novel)|December]]<!--"Bad Bargain" should be released December 2006--> 2006.

Five official [[Buffy video games|''Buffy'' video games]] have been released on portable and home consoles. The most recent, ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Chaos Bleeds|Chaos Bleeds]]'', was released in 2003 for [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]], [[Xbox]] and [[PlayStation 2]]. This was the first game that allowed players to take control of characters other than Buffy Summers.

=== Undeveloped spinoffs ===
{{main|Undeveloped Buffyverse productions}}

The popularity of ''Buffy'' and ''Angel'' has led to attempts to develop more on-screen ventures in the fictional 'Buffyverse'. These projects remain undeveloped and may never be greenlighted. In 2002, two potential spinoffs were in discussion: [[Buffy the Animated Series|''Buffy the Animated Series'']] and [[Undeveloped Buffyverse productions#Ripper|''Ripper'']]. ''Buffy the Animated Series'' was a proposed animated TV show based on ''Buffy''. Whedon and [[Jeph Loeb]] were to be Executive Producers for the show and most of the cast from ''Buffy'' were to return to voice their characters. 20th Century Fox showed an interest in developing and selling the show to another network. A three minute pilot was completed in 2004 but never picked up. Whedon revealed to [[Hollywood Reporter]]: "We just couldn't find a home for [it]. We had six or seven hilarious scripts from our own staff <U+2014> and nobody wanted it."<ref>Hockensmith, Steve, "[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1889839 Dialogue with 'Buffy' creator Joss Whedon]", ''Hollywoodreporter.com'' ([[May 16]], [[2003]])</ref> Neither the pilot nor the scripts have been seen outside of the entertainment industry, though writer [[Jane Espenson]] has teasingly revealed small extracts from some of her scripts for the show.<ref>Espenson, Jane, "[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000095.php Reading what's been written to sound written as it's spoken]", ''Janeespenson.com'' (May 9, 2006) & "[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000097.php Sorry, JVC, but it's simply true]", ''Janeespenson.com'' ([[May 11]], [[2006]])</ref>

[[Undeveloped Buffyverse productions#Ripper|''Ripper'']] was originally a proposed [[television program|television show]] based upon the character of [[Rupert Giles]]. More recent information has suggested that if ''Ripper'' were ever made it would be a TV-movie or a DVD-movie.<ref>''[[Buffyverse Magazines (UK)|UK Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel Magazine]]''. Titan Magazines, Issue 80, (December 2005), p19.</ref> [[As of 2006]], there are still no concrete plans.

In 2003, a year after the first public discussions on ''Buffy the Animated Series'' and ''Ripper'', ''Buffy'' was nearing its end. Espenson has said that during this time spin-offs were discussed, "I think [[Marti Noxon|Marti]] talked with [[Joss Whedon|Joss]] about ''Slayer School'' and [[Tim Minear]] talked with him about Faith on a motorcycle. I assume there was some back-and-forth pitching."<ref>"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/buffy/2003/07/03/5522.shtml Dear Jane]" (spoilers!), ''BBC.co.uk'' ([[July 3]], [[2003]]).</ref>
Espenson has revealed that [[Undeveloped Buffyverse productions#Slayer School|''Slayer School'']] might have used new slayers and potentially included [[Willow Rosenberg]], but Whedon did not think that such a spinoff felt right.<ref>'Hercules', "[http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=14787 Way Interesting Buffy Bits (Courtesy Jane E & Others)]", ''Aintitcool.com'' ([[March 21]], [[2003]]).

Dushku declined the pitch for a Buffyverse [[Undeveloped Buffyverse productions#Faith the Vampire Slayer|TV series based on Faith]] and instead agreed to a deal to produce ''[[Tru Calling]]''. Dushku explained to ''IGN'': "It would have been a really hard thing to do, and not that I wouldn't have been up for a challenge, but with it coming on immediately following [''Buffy''], I think that those would have been really big boots to fill."<ref>Kuhn, Sarah, "[http://uk.filmforce.ign.com/articles/421/421047p2.html An Interview with Eliza Dushku]", ''Ign.com'' ([[May 28]], [[2003]]), web-page 2.</ref> Tim Minear explained some of the ideas behind the aborted series: "The show was basically going to be Faith meets Kung Fu. It would have been Faith, probably on a motorcycle, crossing the earth, trying to find her place in the world."<ref>[[Femme fatale (disambiguation)|''Femme Fatale'']], (May<U+2013>June 2003).

Finally, during the summer of 2004 after the end of ''Angel'', a [[Spike (film)|movie]] about [[Spike (Buffyverse)|Spike]] was proposed.<ref>[http://whedonesque.com/comments/3877 Spike TV movie on the cards?], ''Whedonesque.com'' (May 9, 2004).

==Cultural impact==
''Buffy'' has had a cultural impact on a number of mediums. It has impacted [[television studies]], fan-made films, it has been parodied and referenced, and has even influenced other television series.

=== Academia ===
{{main|Buffy studies}}

BtVS is notable for attracting the interest of scholars of popular culture as a subset of [[popular culture studies]]. Academic settings increasingly include the show as a topic of literary study and analysis.<ref>[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20040529/scholars_buffy_040529?s_name=&no_ads= Scholars lecture on 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'], ''Ctv.ca'' (May 29, 2004).</ref><ref>"[http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/article.html?in_article_id=13473&in_page_id=2  Study Buffy at university]", ''Metro.co.uk'' (May 16, 2006) MA course at Brunel University, West London.</ref> [[National Public Radio]] describes ''Buffy'' as having a "special following among academics, some of whom have staked a claim in what they call "Buffy Studies."<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3850482 Ulaby, Neda], "[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1262180  - 'Buffy Studies']", ''National Public Radio'' (May 13, 2003)</ref> Though not widely recognised as a distinct discipline, the term "Buffy studies" is commonly used amongst the peer-reviewed academic ''Buffy''-related writings.<ref>Lavery, David, & Wilcox, Rhonda V., [http://www.slayage.tv ''Slayage.tv''] (2001-). The term is in use from the full title of ''Slayage'': ''Slayage: The Online International Journal of Buffy Studies'', and thus has become used in essays by those who contribute to scholarship relating to ''Buffy''.</ref> The response to this attention has had its critics, for example Jes Battis who authored ''[[Blood Relations: Chosen Families in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Angel"|Blood Relations in Buffy and Angel]]'' admits that study of the Buffyverse "invokes an uneasy combination of enthusiasm and ire", and meets "a certain amount of disdain from within the halls of the academy".<ref>Battis, Jes, [[Blood Relations: Chosen Families in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Angel"|''Blood Relations'']], ''McFarland & Company'' (June 2005), page 9.</ref> Nonetheless the debut of ''Buffy'' (1997-2003) has eventually led to the publication of around twenty books and hundreds of articles examining the themes of the show from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives including [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], and [[women's studies]].<ref>See:

===Fandom and fan films===
:''See also: [[Buffyverse (Fan made productions)]]''

The popularity of ''Buffy'' has led to websites, online discussion forums, works of [[Buffyverse (Fan made productions)#Fan fiction (literature)|''Buffy'' fan fiction]] and several unofficial fan-made productions. [[Buffyverse (Fan made productions)#Fan films|''Buffy'' fan films]] have been created for distribution on the internet. In 2001 "''[[Fluffy the English Vampire Slayer]]''" was released and became "one of the first widely watched Whedonverse fan films".<ref>Newitz, Annalee, "[http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,71084-1.html?tw=wn_story_page_next1 Fan Films Reclaim the Whedonverse]", ''Wired.com'' ([[June 8]], [[2006]]).</ref> The computer-animated series [[Consanguinity (Buffyverse)|''Consanguinity'']], following the non-canonical vampires Damien and James, was released from 2004 onwards. Most recently [[Cherub (Buffyverse)|''Cherub'']], a parody of ''Angel'', has completed its second and final season. The upcoming [[Forgotten Memories (Buffyverse)|''Forgotten Memories'']] will provide a direct continuation of ''Buffy'' (with all roles recast), set 2<U+2013>3 months after "[[Chosen (Buffy episode)|Chosen]]".

=== Parodies ===
{{main|Buffyverse parodies}}

The show has been spoofed by several comedy sketch shows. For example ''[[MADtv]]'' featured a "Buffy the Umpire Slayer" sketch, in which Buffy slew [[Umpire (baseball)|umpires]] in high school baseball games.<ref>"Buffy the Umpire Slayer" on ''[[MadTV]]'', Season 3, episode 8 (aired November 1997). See:[http://www.madtv.com/html/episodes/season3.html ''Madtv.com'' entry], [http://www.restlessbtvs.com/trivia/the-umpire-slayer-2/ ''Restlessbtvs.com'' entry].</ref> Sometimes ''Buffy'' cast members have been involved in spoofs. [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] has participated in several sketches parodying ''Buffy'', including a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch in which the Slayer is relocated to the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' universe,<ref>[[SNL]] Season 24, episode 19, (aired [[May 15]] [[1999]]) see: [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0694758/ ''IMDb'' entry]. Also see 'doggans' (transcriber) [http://snltranscripts.jt.org/97/97kbuffy.phtml SNL Transcripts: "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"], ''Snltranscripts.jt.org'' (1997).</ref> and adding her voice to an episode of ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' that parodied a would-be eighth season of ''Buffy'' ([[Seth Green]], who played Oz on ''Buffy'', is a co-creator of this series).<ref>"Buffy Season 8" from ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' Season 1, episode 4 (aired [[13 March]] [[2005]]). See: [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0687782/ ''IMDb'' entry], [http://whedonesque.com/comments/6038 ''Whedonesque.com''].</ref>

''[[The Simpsons]]'' 2005 episode, "[[Treehouse of Horror XVI]]" contained four segments, the last of which was entitled, "I've Grown a Costume on Your Face" and parodied the Buffy episode "[[Halloween (Buffy episode)|Halloween]]" (which had aired eight years earlier). 

There are several [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer adult parodies|''Buffy'' adult parodies]], web comic parodies include ''[http://www.sluggy.com/daily.php?date=990510 Muffin the Vampire Baker]'' on the [[Sluggy Freelance]] [[webcomic]], and several musical spoofs including: ''[http://www.omwh.com/ Once More With Hobbits],'' which rewrites the lyrics of Buffy's musical episode ''Once More, with Feeling'' and the [[filk]] song "Angel's Lament".<ref>"Angel's Lament" by "[http://www.thebards.net/ Brobdingnagian Bards]". See [http://mp3-postcards.com/listen/?883 the song] and [http://www.thebards.net/music/lyrics/Angels_Lament.shtml the lyrics]</ref>

===Cultural references===
The series, which employed pop-culture references as a frequent humorous device, has itself become a frequent pop-culture reference in video games, comics and television shows.<ref>Examples: [[Anarchy Online]] ([[June 27]], [[2001]]) features a decorative statue called the "Marble Statue of the Goddess Buffy Summers". [[The X-Files: Resist or Serve]] ([[March 14]], [[2004]]), see [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0353016/quotes "Memorable Quotes from Resist or Serve"], ''Internet Movie Database''. [[Max Payne]] ([[July 25]], [[2001]]) a secret room contains a staked corpse with "Buffy" smeared on the wall in blood.</ref><ref>Examples: ''[[Archie Comics]]'' the character Betty Cooper dresses up as Bunny the Vampire Slayer for a Halloween costume party. ''[[The Wotch]]'' - [http://www.thewotch.com/ ''Thewotch.com''] web comic frequently references ''Buffy''.</ref><ref>Examples: ''[[Charmed]]'' episode "The Power Of Two"; Alyssa Milano's character asks "Where's Buffy when you need her?". Also ''[[House of Mouse]]'' episode "Gone Goofy", when Donald Duck is watching TV, there is a show on called "Goofy the Vampire Slayer".</ref>
For example, in the ''[[Friends]]'' episode entitled "[[The One Where Chandler Can't Cry]]", [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe]]'s sister [[List of recurring characters in Friends#Ursula Pamela Buffay|Ursula]] stars in a movie entitled ''Buffay the Vampire Layer''.<ref>Various authors, [http://www.tv.com/supernatural/hell-house/episode/620823/trivia.html#trivia ''Friends'': "The One Where Chandler Can't Cry"; allusions] ''TV.com'' (episode aired [[February 10]], [[2000]]).</ref>
Similarly, in the ''[[Supernatural (TV series)|Supernatural]]'' episode "[[List of Supernatural episodes|Hell House]]", two amateur ghost hunters ask themselves "What would Buffy do?"<ref>Various authors, "[http://www.tv.com/supernatural/hell-house/episode/620823/trivia.html#trivia ''Supernatural'': "Hell House"; trivia]" ''Tv.com'' (episode aired March 30, 2006).</ref>

In 2005, a [[Trans-Neptunian object]] [[2004 XR190|{{mp|2004 XR|190}}]] was unofficially named "Buffy", after the main character of the series.<ref>"[http://www.newscientistspace.com/article.ns?id=dn8455 Strange new object found at edge of Solar System]" ''New Scientist'' ([[13 December]] [[2005]]).</ref>

=== Impact on television ===
Commentators of the entertainment industry including ''All Movie Guide'', ''Hollywood Reporter'' and the ''Washington Post'' have cited ''Buffy'' as "influential".<ref>For example: Dillard, Brian J., "[http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=A174873 <nowiki>Buffy the Vampire Slayer [TV Series]</nowiki>]", ''All Movie Guide'' (2003 or after): "wildly influential cult hit". Harrington, Richard, "[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/29/AR2005092900594.html Joss Whedon's New Frontier]", ''Washington Post'' (September 30, 2005): "One of the best, most influential, genre-defining television series in decades". Kit, Borys, "[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000845143 Whedon lassos 'Wonder' helm for Warners]", ''Hollywood Reporter'' (March 17, 2005): "the influential WB Network/UPN drama series".</ref> Autumn 2003 saw several new shows going into production in the U.S. that featured strong females forced to come to terms with supernatural power or destiny while trying to maintain a normal life.<ref>Salem, Rob, "[http://www.whedon.info/article.php3?id_article=1319&img= ''Whedon.info'' The season to talk to dead people]", ''Thestar.com'', transcribed to ''Whedon.info'' ([[August 25]], [[2003]]).</ref> These post-''Buffy'' shows include ''[[Dead Like Me]]'' and ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]''. [[Bryan Fuller]], the creator of ''Dead Like Me'' said that "[''Buffy''] showed that young women could be in situations that were both fantastic and relatable, and instead of shunting women off to the side, it put them at the center."<ref>Salem, Rob, "[http://www.whedon.info/article.php3?id_article=1319&img= The season to talk to dead people]", ''TheStar.com'', transcribed to ''Whedon.info'' ([[August 25]], [[2003]]).</ref> ''Buffy'' was used as a blueprint for the current British series of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' (2005-),<ref>B, KJ, "[http://uk.filmforce.ign.com/articles/595/595354p1.html Doctor Who Report: New Theme Music?; Buffy a Template for New Doctor Who?]", ''Ign.com'' (March 11, 2005): "Producer Steve Moffat admits that the blueprint for the new series was Buffy the Vampire Slayer."</ref> and executive producer [[Russell T. Davies]] has said

{{cquote|''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' showed the whole world, and an entire sprawling industry, that writing monsters and demons and end-of-the world isn<U+2019>t hack-work, it can challenge the best. Joss Whedon raised the bar for every writer<U+2014>not just genre/niche writers, but every single one of us.<ref>Moore,  Candace, "[http://www.afterelton.com/TV/2005/5/drwho.html John Barrowman Plays Bisexual Time Traveler on New Dr. Who]", ''Afterelton.com'' (May 19, 2005).</ref>}}

In addition, ''Buffy'' alumni have gone on to write for or create other shows, some of which bear a notable resemblance to the style and concepts of ''Buffy''. Such endeavors include ''[[Tru Calling]]'' ([[Douglas Petrie]], [[Jane Espenson]] and even lead actress [[Eliza Dushku]]), ''[[Wonderfalls]]'' ([[Tim Minear]]), ''[[Point Pleasant (TV series)|Point Pleasant]]'' (Marti Noxon), ''[[Jake 2.0]]'' ([[David Greenwalt]]), ''[[The Inside]]'' (Tim Minear) and ''[[Smallville]]'' ([[Steven S. DeKnight]]).

The [[Parents Television Council]] was not impressed with the series, for its efforts to "deluge their young viewing audiences with adult themes".<ref><small>"[http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2002/main.asp The 2001-2002 Top 10 Best and Worst Shows on Network TV]" & "[http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/reports/stateindustryviolence/main.asp TV Bloodbath: Violence on Prime Time Broadcast TV]" ''Parentstv.org'' (2002 & 2003 respectively).</ref> Some Christian groups also worried about the series positive portrayal of witchcraft.<ref><small>Hadley, Phil, "[http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Evils%20in%20America/Hellivision/buffy_and_sabrina.htm Are Buffy and Sabrina Angels?]", ''Jesus-is-savior.com'' (October 2000).</ref>

== Series information ==

Discounting the [[Unaired Buffy pilot|Unaired ''Buffy'' pilot]], the seven seasons make up [[List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes|a total of 144 ''Buffy'' episodes]] aired between 1997 and 2003.

=== Awards and nominations ===
{{main|Buffy the Vampire Slayer awards and nominations}}

''Buffy'' has gathered a number of awards and nominations which include an [[Emmy Award]] nomination for the 2000 episode "[[Hush (Buffy episode)|Hush]]", which featured an extended sequence with no character dialogue.<ref name="awards">Various authors, [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276/awards "Awards for ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'']", ''Internet Movie Database'' (updated 2005).</ref> The 2001 episode "[[The Body (Buffy episode)|The Body]]" revolved around the death of Buffy's mother.
