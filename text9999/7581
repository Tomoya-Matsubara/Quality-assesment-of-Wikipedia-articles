The '''Peasants' Revolt''', also called '''Wat Tyler's Rebellion''' or the '''Great Rising''', was a major uprising across large parts of England in 1381. The revolt had various causes, including the economic and political tensions generated by the [[Black Death]] in the 1340s, the high taxes resulting from the conflict with France during the [[Hundred Years War]], and instability within the local leadership of London. The final trigger for the revolt was the intervention of a royal official, John Bampton, in [[Essex]] on 30 May 1381. His attempts to collect unpaid [[poll tax]]es in the town of [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]] ended in a violent confrontation, which rapidly spread across the south-east of the country. A wide spectrum of rural society, including many local artisans and village officials, rose up in protest, burning court records and opening the local gaols. The rebels sought a reduction in taxation, an end to the system of unfree labour known as  [[serfdom]] and the removal of the King's senior officials and law courts.

Inspired by the sermons of the [[Christian radicalism|radical]] cleric [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]], and led by [[Wat Tyler]], a contingent of [[Kent]]ish rebels advanced on London. They were met at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] by representatives of the royal government, who unsuccessfully attempted to persuade them to return home. King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], then aged only 14, retreated to the safety of the [[Tower of London]], but most of the royal forces were abroad or in northern England. On 13 June, the rebels entered London and, joined by many local townsfolk, attacked the gaols, destroyed the [[Savoy Palace]] and [[Temple, London|the Temple]] [[Inns of Court]], set fire to law books and killed anyone associated with the royal government. The following day, Richard met the rebels at [[Mile End]] and acceded to most of their demands, including the abolition of serfdom. Meanwhile, rebels entered the Tower of London, killing the [[Simon Sudbury|Lord Chancellor]] and the [[Robert Hales|Lord High Treasurer]], whom they found inside.

On 15 June Richard left the city to meet with Tyler and the rebels at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]]. Violence broke out, and Richard's party killed Tyler. Richard defused the tense situation long enough for London's mayor, [[William Walworth]], to gather a militia from the city and disperse the rebel forces. Richard immediately began to re-establish order in London and rescinded his previous grants to the rebels. The revolt had also spread into [[East Anglia]], where the [[University of Cambridge]] was attacked and many royal officials were killed. Unrest continued until the intervention of [[Henry le Despenser]], who defeated a rebel army at the [[Battle of North Walsham]] on 25 or 26 June. Troubles extended north to the cities of [[York]], [[Beverley]] and [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], and west as far as [[Bridgwater]] in [[Somerset]]. Richard mobilised around 4,000 soldiers to help restore order. Most of the rebel leaders were tracked down and executed; by November, at least 1,500 rebels had been killed.

The Peasants' Revolt has been widely studied by academics. Late 19th-century historians used a range of sources from contemporary [[chroniclers]] to assemble an account of the uprising, and these were supplemented in the 20th century by research using court records and local archives. Interpretations of the revolt have shifted over the years. Once seen as a defining moment in English history, modern academics are less certain of its impact on subsequent social and economic history. The revolt heavily influenced the course of the Hundred Years War, by deterring later Parliaments from raising additional taxes to pay for military campaigns in France. The revolt has been widely used in [[socialist literature]], including by the author [[William Morris]], and remains a potent political symbol for the [[Left-wing politics|political left]], informing the arguments surrounding the introduction of the [[Community Charge]] in the United Kingdom during the 1980s.

{{main|Consequences of the Black Death}}
The Peasants' Revolt was fed by the economic and social upheaval of the 14th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|pp=22<U+2013>23}}</ref> At the start of the century, the majority of English people worked in the countryside, as part of a sophisticated economy that fed the country's towns and cities and supported an extensive international trade.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|pp=1<U+2013>3}}</ref> Across much of England, production was organised around [[manor]]s, controlled by local lords&nbsp;<U+2013> including the [[gentry]] and the [[Religion in England|Church]]&nbsp;<U+2013> and governed through a system of [[manorial court]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=14}}</ref> Some of the population were unfree [[serf]]s, who had to work on their lords' lands for a period of time each year, although the balance of free and unfree varied across England, and in the south-east there were relatively few serfs.<ref>{{harvnb|Postan|1975|p=172}}</ref> Some serfs were born unfree and could not leave their manors to work elsewhere without the consent of the local lord; others accepted limitations on their freedom as part of the tenure agreement for their farmland.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=14}}; {{harvnb|Postan|1975|p=172}}</ref> Population growth led to pressure on the available agricultural land, increasing the power of local landowners.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=249}}; {{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=15}}</ref>

In 1348 a plague known as the [[Black Death]] crossed from Europe into England, rapidly killing an estimated 50 per cent of the population.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|pp=271<U+2013>272}}</ref> After an initial period of economic shock, England began to adapt to the changed economic situation.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|pp=273<U+2013>274}}</ref> The death rate among the peasantry meant that suddenly land was relatively plentiful and manpower in much shorter supply.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=65}}</ref> Labourers could charge more for their work and, in the consequent competition for labour, wages were driven sharply upwards.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=278}}</ref> In turn, the profits of landowners were eroded.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2000|pp=202<U+2013>203}}</ref> The trading, commercial and financial networks in the towns disintegrated.<ref>{{harvnb|Butcher|1987|p=86}}</ref>

The authorities responded to the chaos with emergency legislation, the [[Ordinance of Labourers 1349|Ordinance of Labourers]], passed in 1349, and the [[Statute of Labourers 1351|Statute of Labourers]] of 1351.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=282}}</ref> These attempted to fix wages at pre-plague levels, making it a crime to refuse work or to break an existing contract, imposing fines on those who transgressed.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=282}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=69}}</ref> The system was initially enforced through special [[Judicial officer|Justices]] of Labourers and then, from the 1360s onwards, through the normal [[Justice of the Peace|Justices of the Peace]], typically members of the local gentry.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|pp=282, 285}}</ref> Although in theory these laws applied to both labourers seeking additional wages and to employers tempted to outbid their competitors for workers, they were in practice applied only to labourers, and then in a rather arbitrary fashion.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|pp=282<U+2013>283}}</ref> The legislation was strengthened in 1361, with the penalties increased to include [[Human branding|branding]] and imprisonment.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=69}}</ref> The royal government had not intervened in this way before, or allied itself with the local landowners in quite such an obvious or unpopular way.<ref name="Dyer 2009 285">{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=285}}</ref>

Over the next few decades, economic opportunities increased for the English peasantry.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=122}}</ref> Some labourers took up specialist jobs that would have previously been barred to them, and others moved from employer to employer, or became servants in richer households.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=279}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|pp=122<U+2013>123}}</ref> These changes were keenly felt across the south-east of England, where the London market created a wide range of opportunities for farmers and artisans.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2000|p=200}}</ref> Local lords had the right to prevent serfs from leaving their manors, but when serfs found themselves blocked in the manorial courts, many simply left to work illegally on manors elsewhere.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=122}}; {{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=278}}; {{harvnb|Postan|1975|p=172}}</ref> Wages continued to rise, and between the 1340s and the 1380s the purchasing power of rural labourers increased by around 40 percent.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=279}}</ref> As the wealth of the lower classes increased, Parliament brought in [[Statute Concerning Diet and Apparel 1363|fresh laws in 1363]] to prevent them from consuming expensive goods formerly only affordable by the elite. These [[sumptuary law]]s proved unenforceable, but the wider labour laws continued to be firmly applied.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|pp=283<U+2013>284}}; {{harvnb|Jones|2010|p=16}}</ref>

===War and finance===
Another factor in the revolt of 1381 was the management of the war with France. In 1337 [[Edward III of England]] had pressed [[British claims to the French throne|his claims to the French throne]], beginning a long-running conflict that became known as the [[Hundred Years War]]. Edward had initial successes, but his campaigns were not decisive. [[Charles V of France]] became more active in the conflict after 1369, taking advantage of his country's greater economic strength to commence cross-Channel raids on England.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=121}}; {{harvnb|Sumption|2009|pp=18, 53<U+2013>60}}</ref> By the 1370s, England's armies on the continent were under huge military and financial pressure; the garrisons in [[Calais]] and [[Brest, France|Brest]] alone, for example, were costing <U+00A3>36,000 a year to support, while military expeditions could consume <U+00A3>50,000 in only six months.<ref>{{harvnb|Sumption|2009|pp=325<U+2013>327, 354<U+2013>355, 405}}; {{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=52}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|It is impossible to accurately compare 14th century and modern prices or incomes. For comparison, the income of a typical nobleman such as [[Richard le Scrope, 1st Baron Scrope of Bolton|Richard le Scrope]] was around <U+00A3>600 a year, while only six [[earl]]s in the kingdom enjoyed incomes of over <U+00A3>5,000 a year.<ref>{{harvnb|Given-Wilson|1996|p=157}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=161}}</ref>|group="nb"}} Edward died in 1377, leaving the throne to his grandson, [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], then only ten years old.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=120}}</ref>

Richard's government was formed around his uncles, most prominently the rich and powerful [[John of Gaunt]], and many of his grandfather's former senior officials. They faced the challenge of financially sustaining the war in France. Taxes in the 14th century were raised on an ''ad hoc'' basis through Parliament, then comprising the [[House of Lords|Lords]], the titled aristocracy and clergy; and the [[House of Commons of England|Commons]], the representatives of the knights, merchants and senior gentry from across England.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=50}}</ref> These taxes were typically imposed on a household's movable possessions, such as their goods or stock.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=50}}</ref> The raising of these taxes affected the members of the Commons much more than the Lords.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2010|pp=19<U+2013>20}}</ref> To exacerbate matters, the official statistics used to administrate the taxes predated the Black Death and, since the size and wealth of local communities no longer bore much resemblance to the pre-plague figures, effective collection had become increasingly difficult.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=51}}</ref>

Just before Edward's death, Parliament introduced a new form of taxation called the [[poll tax]], which was levied at the rate of four pence on every person over the age of 14, with a deduction for married couples.<ref name=Jones2010Dunn201P51>{{harvnb|Jones|2010|p=21}}; {{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=51}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|For comparison, the wage for an unskilled labourer in Essex in 1380 was around three pence a day.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2000|p=168}}</ref>|group="nb"}} Designed to spread the cost of the war over a broader economic base than previous tax levies, this round of taxation proved extremely unpopular but raised <U+00A3>22,000.<ref name=Jones2010Dunn201P51/> The war continued to go badly and, despite raising some money through forced loans, the Crown returned to Parliament in 1379 to request further funds.<ref>{{harvnb|Sumption|2009|pp=325<U+2013>327, 354<U+2013>355}}; {{harvnb|Dunn|2002|pp=51<U+2013>52}}</ref> The Commons were supportive of the young King, but had concerns about the amounts of money being sought and the way this was being spent by the King's counsellors, whom they suspected of corruption.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=120}}; {{harvnb|Sumption|2009|p=355}}</ref> A second poll tax was approved, this time with a sliding scale of taxes against seven different classes of English society, with the upper classes paying more in absolute terms.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|pp=50<U+2013>51}}</ref> Tax evasion proved to be a problem, and it only raised <U+00A3>18,600, much less than the <U+00A3>50,000 that had been hoped for.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=51}}; {{harvnb|Jones|2010|p=22}}</ref>

In November 1380, Parliament was called together again in [[Northampton]]. Archbishop [[Simon Sudbury]], the new [[Lord Chancellor of England|Lord Chancellor]], updated the Commons on the worsening situation in France, a collapse in international trade, and the risk of the Crown having to default on its debts.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|pp=52<U+2013>53}}</ref> The Commons were told that the colossal sum of <U+00A3>160,000 was now required in new taxes, and arguments ensued between the royal council and Parliament about what to do next.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=53}}; {{harvnb|Sumption|2009|p=407}}</ref> Parliament passed a third poll tax, this time on a flat-rate basis of 12 pence on each person over 15, with no allowance made for married couples, which they estimated would raise <U+00A3>66,666.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=53}}; {{harvnb|Sumption|2009|p=408}}</ref> The third poll tax was highly unpopular and many in the south-east evaded it by refusing to register.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=54}}; {{harvnb|Sumption|2009|p=419}}</ref> The royal council appointed new commissioners in March 1381 to interrogate local village and town officials in an attempt to find those who were refusing to comply.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=55}}</ref> The extraordinary powers and interference of these teams of investigators in local communities, primarily in the south-east and east of England, raised still further the tensions surrounding the fresh taxes.<ref>{{harvnb|Sumption|2009|pp=419<U+2013>420}}; {{harvnb|Powell|1896|p=5}}</ref>

===Protest and authority===
[[File:Sheep pen (Luttrell Psalter).png|thumb|300px|alt=Medieval painting|Sheep farming, from the [[Luttrell Psalter]], c. 1320<U+2013>40]]
The decades running up to 1381 were a rebellious, troubled period.<ref>{{harvnb|Postan|1975|p=171}}; {{harvnb|Dyer|2000|p=214}}</ref> London was a particular locus for unrest, and the activities of the city's politically active [[guild]]s and [[Fraternity|fraternities]] often alarmed the authorities.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|pp=121<U+2013>122}}</ref> Londoners were unhappy with the expansion of the royal legal system in the capital, in particular the increased role of the [[Marshalsea Court]] in Southwark, which had begun to compete with the city authorities for judicial power in London.<ref>{{harvnb|Harding|1987|pp=176<U+2013>180}}; {{harvnb|Dunn|2002|pp=80<U+2013>81}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The Marshalsea Court was originally intended to provide justice for the royal household and those doing business with it, travelling with the King around the country and having authority covering {{convert|12|miles}} around the monarch. The monarchs of the 14th century were increasingly based in London, resulting in the Marshalsea Court taking up semi-permanent business in the capital. Successive monarchs used the court to exercise royal power, often at the expense of the City of London's Corporation.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|pp=80<U+2013>81}}</ref>|group="nb"}} The city's population also resented the presence of foreigners, [[Flemish people|Flemish]] weavers in particular.<ref>{{harvnb|Spindler|2012|pp=65,72}}</ref> Londoners detested John of Gaunt because he was a supporter of the religious reformer [[John Wycliffe]], whom the London public regarded as a heretic.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2010|p=34}}</ref> John of Gaunt was also engaged in a feud with the London elite and was rumoured to be planning to replace the elected [[Lord Mayor of London|Mayor]] with a captain, appointed by the Crown.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2010|pp=34, 35, 40}}</ref> The London elite were themselves fighting out a vicious, internal battle for political power.<ref>{{harvnb|Oman|1906|p=18}}</ref> As a result, in 1381 the ruling classes in London were unstable and divided.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2010|p=40}}</ref>

Rural communities, particularly in the south-east, were unhappy with the operation of serfdom and the use of the local manorial courts to exact traditional fines and levies, not least because the same landowners who were running these courts also often acted as enforcers of the unpopular labour laws or as royal judges.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2000|pp=213<U+2013>217}}</ref> Many of the village elites refused to take up positions in local government and began to frustrate the operation of the courts.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2000|pp=211<U+2013>212}}</ref> Animals seized by the courts began to be "rescued" by their owners, and legal officials were assaulted.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2000|p=212}}</ref> Some started to advocate the creation of independent village communities, respecting traditional laws but separate from the hated legal system centred in London.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2000|p=219}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|pp=123<U+2013>124}}</ref> As the historian [[Miri Rubin]] describes, for many, "the problem was not the country's laws, but those charged with applying and safeguarding them".<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=124}}</ref>

Concerns were raised about these changes in society.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=281}}</ref> [[William Langland]] wrote the poem ''[[Piers Plowman]]'' in the years before 1380, praising peasants who respected the law and worked hard for their lords, but complaining about greedy, travelling labourers demanding higher wages.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|pp=281, 282}}</ref> The poet [[John Gower]] feared England might see an uprising similar to the French [[Jacquerie]] revolt of 1358, in which the peasants had risen up against their masters.<ref>{{harvnb|Sumption|2009|p=419}}</ref> There was a [[moral panic]] about the threat posed by newly arrived workers in the towns and the possibility that servants might turn against their masters.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=70}}</ref> New legislation was introduced in 1359 to deal with migrants, existing [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy laws]] were more widely applied and the [[Treason Act 1351|treason laws]] were extended to include servants or wives who betrayed their masters and husbands.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=70}}; {{harvnb|Harding|1987|pp=18<U+2013>190}}</ref> By the 1370s, there were even fears that if the French invaded England, the rural classes might side with the invaders.<ref name="Dyer 2009 285"/>

The discontent began to give way to open protest. In 1377, the "[[Great Rumour]]" occurred in south-east and south-west England.<ref>{{harvnb|Faith|1987|p=43}}</ref> Rural workers organised themselves and refused to work for their lords, arguing that, according to the [[Domesday Book]], they were exempted from such requests.<ref>{{harvnb|Faith|1987|pp=44<U+2013>46}}</ref> The workers made unsuccessful appeals to the law courts and the King.<ref>{{harvnb|Faith|1987|p=69}}</ref> There were also widespread urban tensions, particularly in London, where John of Gaunt only narrowly escaped being lynched.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=88}}; {{harvnb|Cohn|2013|p=100}}</ref> The troubles increased again in 1380, with protests and disturbances across the north of England and in the western towns of [[Shrewsbury]] and [[Bridgwater]].<ref>{{harvnb|Cohn|2013|p=105}}; {{harvnb|Dilks|1927|p=59}}</ref> An uprising occurred in York, during which John de Gisborne, the city's mayor, was removed from office, and fresh tax riots followed in early 1381.<ref>{{harvnb|Dobson|1987|p=123}}</ref> There was a great storm in England during May 1381, which many felt to prophesy future change and upheaval, adding further to the disturbed mood.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2000|p=218}}.</ref>

==Events==

===Outbreak of revolt===

====Essex and Kent====
The revolt of 1381 broke out in [[Essex]], following the arrival of John Bampton to investigate non-payment of the poll tax on 30 May.<ref name=Dunn2002P73>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=73}}</ref> Bampton was a member of Parliament, a Justice of the Peace and well-connected with royal circles.<ref name=Dunn2002P73/> He based himself in the town of [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]] and summoned representatives from the neighbouring villages of [[Corringham, Essex|Corringham]], [[Fobbing]] and [[Stanford-le-Hope]] to explain and make good the shortfalls on 1 June.<ref name=Dunn2002P73/> The villagers appear to have arrived well-organised, and armed with old bows and sticks.<ref name="Sumption 2009 420">{{harvnb|Sumption|2009|p=420}}</ref> Bampton first interrogated the people of Fobbing, whose representative, [[Thomas Baker (Peasants' Revolt leader)|Thomas Baker]], declared that his village had already paid their taxes, and that no more money would be forthcoming.<ref name="Sumption 2009 420"/> When Bampton and two sergeants attempted to arrest Baker, violence broke out.<ref name=Dunn2002P73/> Bampton escaped and retreated to London, but three of his clerks and several of the Brentwood townsfolk who had agreed to act as jurors were killed.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=73}}; {{harvnb|Sumption|2009|p=420}}</ref> [[Robert Bealknap]], the Chief Justice of the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]], who was probably already holding court in the area, was empowered to arrest and deal with the perpetrators.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|pp=73<U+2013>74}}</ref>

[[File:Longbowmen.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Medieval painting|Peasant longbowmen at practice, from the Luttrell Psalter, c. 1320<U+2013>40]]

The rebels began to cross from [[Southwark]] onto [[London Bridge]] on the afternoon of 13 June.<ref name="autogenerated79"/> The defences on London Bridge were opened from the inside, either in sympathy for the rebel cause or simply out of fear, and the rebels advanced into the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Sumption|2009|p=424}}; {{harvnb|Dobson|1983|p=220}}; {{harvnb|Barron|1981|p=3}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|It is uncertain who opened the defences at London Bridge and Aldgate.

The historian Nigel Saul is doubtful of their guilt in collaborating with the rebels. Rodney Hilton suggests that they may have opened the gates in order to buy time and so prevent the destruction of their city, although he prefers the theory that the London crowds forced the gates to be opened. Jonathan Sumption similarly argues that the aldermen were forced to open the gates in the face of popular pressure.<ref>{{harvnb|Saul|1999|p=424}}; {{harvnb|Hilton|1995|pp=189-190}}; {{harvnb|Sumption|2009|p=424}}</ref>|group="nb"}} At the same time, the rebel force from Essex made its way towards [[Aldgate]] on the north side of the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Sumption|2009|p=424}}</ref> The rebels swept west through the centre of the city, and Aldgate was opened to let the rest of the rebels in.<ref>{{harvnb|Sumption|2009|p=425}}</ref>

It is uncertain who spoke for the rebels at Mile End, and Wat Tyler may not have been present on this occasion, but they appear to have put forward their various demands to the King, including the surrender of the hated officials on their lists for execution; the abolition of serfdom and unfree tenure; "that there should be no law within the realm save the law of Winchester", and a general amnesty for the rebels.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|pp=68, 96}}; {{harvnb|Oman|1906|p=200}}</ref> It is unclear precisely what was meant by the law of [[Winchester]], but it probably referred to the rebel ideal of self-regulating village communities.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=69}}; {{harvnb|Harding|1987|pp=166<U+2013>167}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The rebel call for a return to the "law of Winchester," a former capital of England until c. 1100, has been much debated.

Another is that it referred to the [[Statute of Winchester]] in 1285, which allowed for the enforcement of local law through armed village communities, and which had been cited in more recent legislation on the criminal law.

The ''Anonimalle Chronicle'' and Walsingham both go into some, if varying, detail as to the rebels' demands. Walsingham and Knighton wrote that Tyler, rather than being about to depart at the end of his discussions with Richard, in fact appeared to be about to kill the King, triggering the royal response.

===Suppression===
[[File:Henry le Despenser 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph|A 14th-century carving of [[Henry le Despenser]], the victor of the [[Battle of North Walsham]]]]
The royal suppression of the revolt began shortly after the death of Wat Tyler on 15 June.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=135}}</ref> Sir [[Robert Knolles]], Sir [[Nicholas Brembre]] and Sir Robert Launde were appointed to restore control in the capital.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|pp=135<U+2013>136}}</ref> A summons was put out for soldiers, probably around 4,000 men were mustered in London, and expeditions to the other troubled parts of the country soon followed.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|pp=135<U+2013>136}}; {{harvnb|Tuck|1987|p=200}}</ref>

The revolt in East Anglia was independently suppressed by [[Henry le Despenser]], the [[Bishop of Norwich]].<ref name=Dunn2002P131/> Henry was in [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]] in Lincolnshire when the revolt broke out, and when he found out about the events he marched south with eight men-at-arms and a small force of archers, gathering more forces as he went.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=131}}; {{harvnb|Oman|1906|pp=130<U+2013>132}}</ref> He marched first to Peterborough, where he routed the local rebels and executed any he could capture, including some who had taken shelter in the local abbey.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2010|pp=172<U+2013>173}}</ref> He then headed south-east via [[Huntingdon]] and Ely, reaching Cambridge on the 19 June, and then heading further into the rebel controlled areas of Norfolk.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2010|pp=178<U+2013>182}}</ref> Henry reclaimed the city of Norwich on 24 June, before heading out with a company of men to track down the rebel leader, Geoffrey Litster.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2010|p=194}}</ref> The two forces met at the [[Battle of North Walsham]] on 25 or 26 June; the Bishop's forces triumphed and Litster was captured and executed.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2010|pp=194<U+2013>195}}</ref> Henry's quick action was essential to the suppression of the revolt in East Anglia, but he was very unusual in taking matters into his own hands in this way, and his execution of the rebels without royal sanction was illegal.<ref>{{harvnb|Tuck|1987|pp=197, 201}}; {{harvnb|Powell|1896|p=61}}</ref>

On 17 June, the King dispatched his half-brother [[Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent|Thomas Holland]] and Sir Thomas Trivet to Kent with a small force to restore order.<ref name=Dunn2002P136>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=136}}</ref> They held courts at Maidstone and Rochester.<ref name=Dunn2002P136/> William de Ufford, the Earl of Suffolk, returned to his county on 23 June, accompanied by a force of 500 men.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|pp=126, 136}}</ref> He quickly subdued the area and was soon holding court in Mildenhall, where many of the accused were sentenced to death.<ref>{{harvnb|Powell|1896|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=136}}</ref> He moved on into Norfolk on 6 July, holding court in Norwich, [[Great Yarmouth]] and [[Hacking, Norfolk|Hacking]].<ref name=Dunn2002P136/> Hugh, Lord la Zouche, led the legal proceedings against the rebels in Cambridgeshire.<ref name=Dunn2002P136/> In St Albans, the Abbot arrested William Grindecobbe and his main supporters.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|pp=140<U+2013>141}}</ref>

On 20 June, the King's uncle, [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Thomas of Woodstock]], and [[Robert Tresilian]], the replacement Chief Justice, were given special commissions across the whole of England.<ref name=Dunn2002P136/> Thomas oversaw court cases in Essex, backed up by a substantial military force as resistance was continuing and the county was still in a state of unrest.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|pp=136<U+2013>137}}</ref> Richard himself visited Essex, where he met with a rebel delegation seeking confirmation of the grants the King had given at Mile End.<ref name=Saul1999P74>{{harvnb|Saul|1999|p=74}}</ref> Richard rejected them, allegedly telling them that "rustics you were and rustics you are still.

===Aftermath===
[[File:Richard II King of England.jpg|thumb|alt=Medieval painting|Late 14th-century portrait of Richard II]]
The royal government and Parliament began to re-establish the normal processes of government after the revolt; as the historian [[Michael Postan]] describes, the uprising was in many ways a "passing episode".<ref>{{harvnb|Postan|1975|p=172}};{{harvnb|Tuck|1987|p=212}}</ref> On 30 June, the King ordered England's serfs to return to their previous conditions of service, and on 2 July the royal charters signed under duress during the rising were formally revoked.<ref name=Dunn2002P136/> Parliament met in November to discuss the events of the year and how best to respond to their challenges.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|pp=141<U+2013>142}}</ref> The revolt was blamed on the misconduct of royal officials, who, it was argued, had been excessively greedy and overbearing.<ref>{{harvnb|Tuck|1987|pp=205<U+2013>206}}</ref> The Commons stood behind the existing labour laws, but requested changes in the royal council, which Richard granted.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=142}}</ref> Richard also granted general pardons to those who had executed rebels without due process, to all men who had remained loyal, and to all those who had rebelled&nbsp;<U+2013> with the exception of the men of Bury St Edmunds, any men who had been involved in the killing of the King's advisers, and those who were still on the run from prison.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|pp=142<U+2013>143}}</ref>

Despite the violence of the suppression, the government and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued to be worried about fresh revolts for several decades.<ref>{{harvnb|Hilton|1995|p=231}}; {{harvnb|Tuck|1987|p=210}}</ref> Few lords took revenge on their peasants except through the legal processes of the courts.<ref>{{harvnb|Tuck|1987|p=201}}</ref> Low-level unrest, however, continued for several more years.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=127}}</ref> In September 1382 there was trouble in Norfolk, involving an apparent plot against the Bishop of Norwich, and in March the following year there was an investigation into a plot to kill the [[sheriff of Devon]].<ref>{{harvnb|Eiden|1999|p=370}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=127}}</ref> When negotiating rents with their landlords, peasants alluded to the memory of the revolt and the threat of violence.<ref name="Dyer 2009 291">{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=291}}</ref>

There were no further attempts by Parliament to impose a poll-tax or to reform England's fiscal system.<ref>{{harvnb|Tuck|1987|pp=203<U+2013>205}}</ref> The Commons instead concluded at the end of 1381 that the military effort on the Continent should be "carefully but substantially reduced".<ref>{{harvnb|Sumption|2009|p=430}}</ref> Unable to raise fresh taxes, the government had to curtail its foreign policy and military expeditions and began to examine the options for peace.<ref>{{harvnb|Tuck|1987|pp=208<U+2013>209}}; {{harvnb|Sumption|2009|p=430}}</ref> The institution of serfdom declined after 1381, but primarily for economic rather than political reasons.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=147}}</ref> Rural wages continued to increase, and lords increasingly sold their serfs freedom in exchange for cash, or converted traditional forms of tenure to new [[leasehold]] arrangements.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=147}}; {{harvnb|Hilton|1995|p=232}}</ref> Over the course of the 15th century, the institution vanished in England.<ref name="Dyer 2009 291"/>

==Rebels==
[[File:Reeve and Serfs.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Medieval painting|14th-century rural scene of reeve directing serfs, from the [[Queen Mary Psalter]]]]
Chroniclers primarily described the rebels as rural serfs, using broad, derogatory [[Latin]] terms such as ''serviles rustici'', ''servile genu'' and ''rustictas''.<ref name=Hilton1995Crane1992P202>{{harvnb|Hilton|1995|pp=176<U+2013>177}}; {{harvnb|Crane|1992|p=202}}</ref> Some chroniclers, however, including Knighton, noted the presence of runaway apprentices, artisans and others, sometimes terming them the "lesser commons".<ref name=Hilton1995Crane1992P202/> The evidence from the court records following the revolt, albeit biased in various ways, similarly shows the involvement of a much broader community, and the earlier perception that the rebels were only constituted of unfree serfs is now rejected.<ref>{{harvnb|Postan|1975|p=171}}; {{harvnb|Hilton|1995|pp=178, 180}}; {{harvnb|Strohm|2008|p=197}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Historian Sylvia Federico notes the dangers in treating the pardons lists simplistically, given the tendency for some innocent individuals to acquire pardons for additional security, and the tendency for cases to be brought against individuals for local, non-political reasons.<ref>{{harvnb|Federico|2001|pp=162<U+2013>163}}</ref>|group="nb"}}

The rural rebels came from a wide range of backgrounds, but typically they were, as the historian Christopher Dyer describes, "people well below the ranks of the gentry, but who mainly held some land and goods", and not the very poorest in society, who formed a minority of the rebel movement.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2000|p=196}}; {{harvnb|Hilton|1995|p=184}}; {{harvnb|Strohm|2008|p=197}}</ref> Many had held positions of authority in local village governance, and these seem to have provided leadership to the revolt.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2000|pp=197<U+2013>198}}</ref> Some were artisans, including, as the historian Rodney Hilton lists, "carpenters, sawyers, masons, cobblers, tailors, weavers, fullers, glovers, hosiers, skinners, bakers, butchers, innkeepers, cooks and a lime-burner".<ref>{{harvnb|Hilton|1995|p=179}}</ref> They were predominantly male, but with some women in their ranks.<ref>{{harvnb|Federico|2001|p=165}}</ref> The rebels were typically illiterate; only between 5 and 15 per cent of England could read during this period.<ref>{{harvnb|Crane|1992|p=202}}</ref> They also came from a broad range of local communities, including at least 330 south-eastern villages.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2000|p=192}}</ref>

Many of the rebels had urban backgrounds, and the majority of those involved in the events of London were probably local townsfolk rather than peasants.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=121}}; {{harvnb|Strohm|2008|pp=197<U+2013>198}}</ref> In some cases, the townsfolk who joined the revolt were the urban poor, attempting to gain at the expense of the local elites.<ref>{{harvnb|Butcher|1987|pp=84<U+2013>85}}</ref> In London, for example, the urban rebels appear to have largely been the poor and unskilled.<ref name="Hilton 1995 195"/> Alternatively, some urban rebels were themselves part of that elite, such as at York where the protesters were typically prosperous members of the local community, while in some instances, townsfolk allied themselves with the rural population, as at Bury St Edmunds.<ref>{{harvnb|Butcher|1987|p=85}}; {{harvnb|Strohm|2008|p=197}}</ref> In other cases, such as Canterbury, the influx of population from the villages following the Black Death made any distinction between urban and rural less meaningful.<ref>{{harvnb|Butcher|1987|p=85}}</ref>

The vast majority of those involved in the revolt of 1381 were not represented in Parliament and were excluded from its decision-making.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=121}}</ref> In a few cases, however, the rebels were led or joined by relatively prosperous members of the gentry, such as Sir Roger Bacon in Norfolk.<ref>{{harvnb|Hilton|1995|p=184}}</ref> Some of these later claimed to have been forced to join the revolt by the rebels.<ref>{{harvnb|Tuck|1987|p=196}}</ref> A number of clergy also formed part of the revolt; in addition to the more prominent leaders, such as John Ball or John Wrawe, nearly 20 are mentioned in the records of the revolt in the south-east.<ref>{{harvnb|Hilton|1995|pp=207<U+2013>208}}</ref> Some were pursuing local grievances, some were disadvantaged and suffering relative poverty, while others appear to have been motivated by strong radical beliefs.<ref>{{harvnb|Hilton|1995|pp=208<U+2013>210}}</ref>

Many of those involved in the revolt used pseudonyms, particularly in the letters sent around the country to encourage support and fresh uprisings.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2010|p=169}}; {{harvnb|Hilton|1995|pp=214<U+2013>215}}</ref> They were used both to avoid incriminating particular individuals and to allude to popular values and stories.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2010|p=169}}</ref> One popular assumed name was Piers Plowman, taken from the main character in William Langland's poem.<ref>{{harvnb|Justice|1994|p=223}}</ref> Jack was also a widely used rebel pseudonym, and historians Steven Justice and Carter Revard suggest that this may have been because it resonated with the Jacques of the French Jacquerie revolt several decades earlier.<ref>{{harvnb|Justice|1994|p=222}}</ref>

===Historiography===
[[File:Portrait of William Stubbs by Hubert von Herkomer.jpeg|thumb|alt=Portrait painting of an older grey-haired man with grey whiskers clad in black and sitting in a chair|Historian [[William Stubbs]], who considered the revolt "one of the most portentous events in the whole of our history", painted by [[Hubert von Herkomer]].<ref name=Hilton1987P2>{{harvnb|Hilton|1987|p=2}}</ref>]]
Contemporary chroniclers of the events in the revolt have formed an important source for historians. The chroniclers were biased against the rebel cause and typically portrayed the rebels, in the words of the historian Susan Crane, as "beasts, monstrosities or misguided fools".<ref>{{harvnb|Crane|1992|p=208}}; {{harvnb|Strohm|2008|pp=198<U+2013>199}}</ref> London chroniclers were also unwilling to admit the role of ordinary Londoners in the revolt, preferring to place the blame entirely on rural peasants from the south-east.<ref name=Strohm2008P201>{{harvnb|Strohm|2008|p=201}}</ref> Among the key accounts was the anonymous ''Anonimalle Chronicle'', whose author appears to have been part of the royal court and an eye-witness to many of the events in London.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2010|p=215}}</ref> The chronicler Thomas Walsingham was present for much of the revolt, but focused his account on the terror of the social unrest and was extremely biased against the rebels.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|pp=99<U+2013>100}}; {{harvnb|Jones|2010|p=215}}</ref> [[Jean Froissart]], the author of the ''[[Froissart's Chronicles|Chronicles]]'', had well-placed sources close to the revolt, but was inclined to elaborate the known facts with colourful stories.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2010|pp=215<U+2013>216}}</ref> No sympathetic accounts of the rebels survive.<ref name="Strohm 2008 203"/>

At the end of the 19th century there was a surge in historical interest in the Peasants' Revolt, spurred by the contemporary growth of the labour and socialist movements.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2003|p=x}}</ref> Work by [[Charles Oman]], Edgar Powell, Andr<U+00E9> R<U+00E9>ville and [[G. M. Trevelyan]] established the course of the revolt.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2003|p=x}}; {{harvnb|Powell|1896}}; {{harvnb|Oman|1906}}; {{harvnb|R<U+00E9>ville |1898}}; {{harvnb|Trevelyan|1899}}</ref> By 1907 the accounts of the chroniclers were all widely available in print and the main public records concerning the events had been identified.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2000|p=191}}</ref> R<U+00E9>ville began to use the legal indictments that had been used against suspected rebels after the revolt as a fresh source of historical information, and over the next century extensive research was carried out into the local economic and social history of the revolt, using scattered local sources across south-east England.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2000|pp=191<U+2013>192}}; {{harvnb|Hilton|1987|p=5}}</ref>

Interpretations of the revolt have changed over the years. 17th-century historians, such John Smyth, established the idea that the revolt had marked the end of unfree labour and serfdom in England.<ref name=Hilton1987P2/> 19th-century historians such as [[William Stubbs]] and [[Thorold Rogers]] reinforced this conclusion, Stubbs describing it as "one of the most portentous events in the whole of our history".<ref name=Hilton1987P2/> In the 20th century, this interpretation was increasingly challenged by historians such as [[May McKisack]], Michael Postan and Richard Dobson, who revised the impact of the revolt on further political and economic events in England.<ref>{{harvnb|Hilton|1987|pp=2<U+2013>3}}</ref> Mid-20th century Marxist historians were both interested in, and generally sympathetic to, the rebel cause, a trend culminating in Hilton's 1973 account of the uprising, set against the context of wider peasant revolts across Europe during the period.<ref>{{harvnb|Strohm|2008|p=203}}; {{harvnb|Hilton|1995}}; {{harvnb|Jones|2010|p=217}}; {{harvnb|Dyer|2003|p=xii-xiii}}</ref> The Peasants' Revolt has received more academic attention than any other medieval revolt, and this research has been typically interdisciplinary in nature, involving historians, literary scholars and international collaboration.<ref>{{harvnb|Cohn|2013|pp=3<U+2013>4}}</ref>

The name "the Peasants' Revolt" emerged in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and its first recorded use by historians was in [[John Richard Green]]'s ''Short History of the English People'' in 1874.<ref name=Strohm2008P201/> Contemporary chronicles did not give the revolt a specific title, and indeed the term "peasant" did not appear in the English language until the 15th century.<ref name=Strohm2008P201/> The title has been critiqued by modern historians such as Miri Rubin and Paul Strohm, both on the grounds that many in the movements were not peasants, and that the events more closely resemble a prolonged protest or rising, rather than a revolt or rebellion.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=121}}; {{harvnb|Strohm|2008|p=202}}; {{harvnb|Cohn|2013|p=3}}</ref>

===Popular culture===
[[File:William.Morris.John.Ball.trimmed.jpg|thumb|alt=Engraved illustration|Illustration from title page to [[William Morris]]'s ''[[A Dream of John Ball]]'' (1888), by [[Edward Burne-Jones]]]]

The Peasants' Revolt became a popular literary subject.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2010|p=208}}</ref> The poet John Gower, who had close ties to officials involved in the suppression of the revolt, wrote his famous poem ''[[Vox Clamantis]]'' in the decades after the revolt, condemning the rebels and likening them to wild animals.<ref>{{harvnb|Galloway|2010|pp=298<U+2013>299}}; {{harvnb|Saul|2010|p=87}}; {{harvnb|Justice|1994|p=208}}</ref> [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], who lived in Aldgate and may have been in London during the revolt itself, used the rebel killing of Flemings as a metaphor for wider disorder in ''[[The Nun's Priest's Tale]]'' part of ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', parodying Gower's poem.<ref>{{harvnb|Justice|1994|pp=207<U+2013>208}}; {{harvnb|Crow|Leland|2008|p=xviii}}</ref> Chaucer otherwise made no reference to the revolt in his work, possibly because as he was a client of the King it would have been politically unwise to have discussed it.<ref>{{harvnb|Hussey|1971|p=6}}</ref> William Langland, the author of the poem ''Piers Plowman'', which had been widely used by the rebels, made various changes to its text after the revolt in order to distance himself from their cause.<ref>{{harvnb|Justice|1994|pp=233<U+2013>237}}; {{harvnb|Crane|1992|pp=211<U+2013>213}}</ref>

The revolt formed the basis for the late 16th-century play, ''[[The Life and Death of Jack Straw]]'', possibly written by [[George Peele]] and probably originally designed for production in the city's guild pageants.<ref>{{harvnb|Ribner|2005|pp=71<U+2013>72}}</ref> It portrays Jack Straw as a tragic figure, being led into wrongful rebellion by John Ball, making clear political links between the instability of late-Elizabethan England and the 14th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Ribner|2005|pp=71<U+2013>74}}</ref> The story of the revolt was used in pamphlets during the [[English Civil War]] of the 17th century, and formed part of [[John Cleveland]]'s early history of the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2010|p=210}}; {{harvnb|Matheson|1998|p=135}}</ref> It was deployed as a cautionary account in political speeches during the 18th century, and a [[chapbook]] entitled ''The History of Wat Tyler and Jack Strawe'' proved popular during the [[Jacobite risings]] and [[American War of Independence]].<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2010|p=210}}; {{harvnb|Matheson|1998|pp=135<U+2013>136}}</ref> [[Thomas Paine]] and [[Edmund Burke]] argued over the lessons to be drawn from the revolt, Paine expressing sympathy for the rebels and Burke condemning the violence.<ref>{{harvnb|Matheson|1998|pp=138<U+2013>139}}</ref> The [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poet]] [[Robert Southey]] based his 1794 play ''Wat Tyler'' on the events, taking a radical and pro-rebel perspective.<ref>{{harvnb|Matheson|1998|p=143}}</ref>

As the historian Michael Postan describes, the revolt became famous "as a landmark in social development and [as] a typical instance of working-class revolt against oppression", and was widely used in 19th and 20th century [[socialist literature]].<ref name=Ortenberg1981P79>{{harvnb|Ortenberg|1981|p=79}}; {{harvnb|Postan|1975|p=171}}</ref> [[William Morris]] built on Chaucer in his novel ''[[A Dream of John Ball]]'', published in 1888, creating a narrator who was openly sympathetic to the peasant cause, albeit a 19th-century persona, taken back to the 14th century via way of a dream.<ref>{{harvnb|Ellis|2000|pp=13<U+2013>14}}</ref> The story ends with a prophecy that socialist ideals will one day be successful.<ref>{{harvnb|Matheson|1998|p=144}}</ref> In turn, this representation of the revolt influenced Morris's [[utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] ''[[News from Nowhere]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Ousby|1996|p=120}}</ref> [[Florence Converse]] used the revolt in her novel ''Long Will'' in 1903.<ref name=Ortenberg1981P79/> Later 20th century socialists continued to draw parallels between the revolt and contemporary political struggles, including during the arguments over the introduction of the [[Community Charge]] in the United Kingdom during the 1980s.<ref name=Ortenberg1981P79/>

The events of 1381 have also attracted interest from [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]], including writer [[John J. Robinson|John Robinson]], who have attempted to explain alleged flaws in mainstream historical accounts of the revolt, such as the speed with which the rebellion was coordinated.<ref>{{harvnb|Robinson|2009|pp=51<U+2013>59}}</ref> Theories include that that revolt was in fact led by a secret, [[occult]] organisation called "the Great Society", said to be an offshoot of the order of the [[Knights Templar]] destroyed in 1312, or that the fraternity of the [[Freemasons]] was covertly involved in organising the revolt.<ref>{{harvnb|Robinson|2009|pp=51<U+2013>59}}; {{harvnb|Silvercloud|2007|p=287}}; {{harvnb|Picknett|Prince|2007|p=164}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The term "the Great Society" emerges from indictments against the rebels, in which references were made the ''magne societatis''. This probably meant "large company" or "great band" of rebels, but was mistranslated in the late 19th century to refer to the "Great Society".<ref>{{harvnb|Hilton|1995|pp=214<U+2013>216}}</ref>|group="nb"}}
