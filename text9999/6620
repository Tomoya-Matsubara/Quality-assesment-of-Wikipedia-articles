The '''Swift Folder''' is a [[folding bicycle]], designed by Peter Reich of Design Mobility Inc.  of [[Brooklyn]], New York, in collaboration with [[Jan VanderTuin]] of the [[Center for Appropriate Transport]] in Eugene, Oregon.

The Swift Folder is available from Design Mobility as a bare [[bicycle frame|frame]] for customers to build up themselves, or assembled into a complete bicycle to the customer's requirements. The bicycle is also sold under license by [[Xootr]] as the Xootr Swift, fully assembled to one standard specification.

==Folding System==
The Swift Folder design employs a vertical folding method, using the seat-post and a split seat-tube as the locking mechanism.

To fold, the seat-post is released from the two parts of the seat-tube by their respective quick release clamps, then pulled up into the upper part of the seat-tube to unlock the frame. A pivot in the main frame tube then allows the rear triangle (comprising the seat-stays, chain-stays and the lower portion of the seat-tube) and rear wheel to swing down and forward under the main tube.  The seat-post is then slid back down through the upper part of the seat-tube to lock the rear wheel in the folded position.  

To unfold, the seat-post is again pulled up to allow the rear triangle to swing back and up into the normal riding position. The seat-post is then slid down through the upper and lower parts of the seat-tube, locking the rear triangle and wheel into place. <ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBIwu-q5lX0 YouTube] video of Xootr Swift folding and unfolding</ref>

The Swift frame is simple and robust, and allows a quick fold, but when folded is not as compact as some other folding bicycle designs. The bottom bracket forms part of the folding rear triangle, and as a result the bottom bracket to rear fork-end distance remains constant throughout the fold. This keeps the chain tension constant, which is an advantage when the Swift frame is used in a fixed-gear, single speed, or [[hub gear]] bicycle.

==Construction==
The Swift Folder [[bicycle frame|frame]] is manufactured from [[Tungsten inert gas welding|TIG welded]] aluminium alloy, while the fork is "[[chromoly]]" steel. The frame is generally built to common "industry-standard" sizes and threads, and can accommodate a wide variety of [[Bicycle gearing|gear systems]], [[Bicycle brake systems|brakes]] and other components. The rear fork spacing can accommodate most standard road and mountain bike wheel-hubs.

The Swift Folder is normally fitted with "20 inch" wheels. The standard [[ISO 5775]] wheel size is 406mm (traditionally known as 20x1 to 20x2.125), the same size used on most [[BMX]] bicycles. A wide variety of wheels and tires is available in this size.
