The '''United States Senate special election of 1962 in Massachusetts''' was held on November 6, 1962.

==History==
Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] resigned the seat to become [[President of the United States]] after winning the [[United States presidential election, 1960|presidential election in 1960]]. [[Benjamin A. Smith II]], a [[Kennedy family]] friend, was appointed to succeed Kennedy, serving as a placeholder for [[Ted Kennedy]], who at the time was too young to be constitutionally eligible for the seat.<ref name="kennedyism"/>   

Ted Kennedy first faced a Democratic Party primary challenge from [[Edward J. McCormack, Jr.]], the [[Massachusetts Attorney General|state Attorney General]]. Kennedy's slogan was "He can do more for Massachusetts", the same one John had used in his first campaign for the seat ten years earlier.<ref name="aap-08-791">{{cite book |title=[[The Almanac of American Politics]] |last=Barone |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Barone (pundit) |authorlink2=Richard E.

In the Republican primary, [[George C. Lodge]], a former member of the Eisenhower administration and the son of [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.|Henry Cabot Lodge]], defeated [[Laurence Curtis]], the [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] from [[Massachusetts's 10th congressional district]] in the Republican primary.<ref name="ourcampaigns.com">http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=24510</ref>

In the November special election, Kennedy defeated Lodge, whose father had lost this seat to John F. Kennedy in [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1952|1952 U.S. Senate election]]. In winning, Kennedy gained 55&nbsp;percent of the vote.<ref name="kennedyism"/><ref name="wt-bio">{{cite news | title=Edward Kennedy (Dem) | publisher=''[[The Washington Times]]'' | date=2006-05-05 | accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref>
