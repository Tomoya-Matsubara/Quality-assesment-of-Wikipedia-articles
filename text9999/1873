==Terminology ==
{{Indigenous Peoples of Canada}}
{{See|Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982}}
The terms ''First Peoples'' and ''First Nations'' are both used to refer to indigenous peoples of Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aidp.bc.ca/terminology_of_native_aboriginal_metis.pdf|title=Terminology of First Nations, Native, Aboriginal and Metis (NAHO)|work=aidp.bc.ca/| accessdate =2009-10-05}}</ref>  The terms ''First Peoples'' or ''Aboriginals'' in Canada are normally broader terms than ''First Nations'', as they include Inuit, M<U+00E9>tis and First Nations. ''First Nations'' (most often used in the plural) has come into general use for the [[indigenous peoples of North America]] in [[History of Canada|Canada]], and their descendants, who are neither Inuit nor M<U+00E9>tis.  On [[List of Indian reserves in Canada|reserves]], ''First Nations'' is being supplanted by members of various nations referring to themselves by their group or national identity.  In conversation this would be "I am Haida", or "we are Kwantlens", in recognition of their First Nations ethnicities.<ref>{{cite book |title=Language and Identity |url=http://books.google.com/?id=wwvOjiqyU-EC&pg=PA1&q=|format=Digitised online by Google books|first= John |last=Edwards |publisher= Cambridge University Press| accessdate =2009-10-05 |isbn=9780521696029 |year=2009 }}</ref>  In this [[Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982|Act]], "Aboriginal peoples of Canada" includes the Indian, Inuit and M<U+00E9>tis peoples of Canada.<ref name="defe">{{cite web

''Indian'' remains in place as the legal term used in the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian Constitution]]; its usage outside such situations can be considered offensive.<ref name=indian/>  ''Aboriginals'' is more commonly used to describe all indigenous peoples of Canada.<ref name=Terminology>{{cite web|url=http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ap/tln-eng.asp|title=Terminology|work=Indian and Northern Affairs Canada| accessdate =2009-10-05 }}</ref>  It also refers to self-identification of aboriginal people who live within Canada claiming rights of sovereignty or aboriginal title to lands.

The term ''Eskimo'' has [[pejorative]] connotations  in Canada and Greenland. Indigenous peoples have replaced the term Eskimo with Inuit.<ref>{{cite book

The Inuit are the descendants of what [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] call the Thule culture, which emerged from western Alaska around 1,000&nbsp;CE and spread eastward across the [[Arctic]], displacing the [[Dorset culture]] (in [[Inuktitut]], the Tuniit). Inuit historically referred to the Tuniit as "giants", or "dwarfs", who were taller and stronger than the Inuit.<ref>{{cite web

[[War]]fare was common among Inuit groups with sufficient population density. Inuit, such as the [[Nunatamiut]] ([[Uummarmiut]]) who inhabited the [[Mackenzie River]] delta area, often engaged in common warfare.  The Central Arctic Inuit lacked the population density to engage in warfare. In the 13th century, the Thule culture began arriving in Greenland from what is now Canada. Norse accounts are scant.

The Indian Act is federal legislation that dates from 1876. There have been over twenty major changes made to the original Act since then, the last time being in 1951; amended in 1985 with [[Bill C-31]]. The Indian Act indicates how Reserves and Bands can operate and defines who is recognised as an "Indian".<ref name="laws">{{cite web

Those people accepted into band membership under band rules may not be status Indians. C-31 clarified that various sections of the Indian Act would apply to band members. The sections under debate concern community life and land holdings. Sections pertaining to Indians (Aboriginals) as individuals (in this case, wills and taxation of personal property) were not included.<ref name="bill"/>

Aboriginals were producing art for thousands of years before the arrival of European [[Settler colonialism|settler colonists]] and the eventual establishment of Canada as a [[nation state]]. Like the peoples who produced them, indigenous art traditions spanned territories across North America. Indigenous art traditions are organised by art historians according to cultural, linguistic or regional groups: Northwest Coast, [[Plateau First Nations|Plateau]], [[Plains Indians|Plains]], [[Eastern Woodlands tribes|Eastern Woodlands]], Subarctic, and Arctic.<ref name="art" />

Art traditions vary enormously amongst and within these diverse groups. Indigenous art with a focus on portability and the body is distinguished from European traditions and its focus on architecture.  Indigenous visual art may be used conjunction with other arts.  [[Shamanism among Eskimo peoples|Shaman]]s' [[Masks among Eskimo peoples|masks]] and rattles are used ceremoniously in dance, storytelling and music.<ref name="art" >{{cite book
