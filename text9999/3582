The '''December 1960 nor'easter''' was a significant early-season winter storm that impacted the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]] regions of the [[United States]]. Moderate to heavy snowfall fell from West Virginia to eastern Maine, amounting to 10&nbsp;in (25&nbsp;cm) or more in parts of 13&nbsp;states and peaking at 21.4&nbsp;in (54.4&nbsp;cm) at [[Newark, New Jersey]]. The storm was accompanied by strong winds, gusting to over 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h) in coastal New England, and left in its wake a dangerously cold air mass. The storm originated in a weak [[low pressure area]] which formed over the western [[Gulf of Mexico]] on December 10. A secondary low developed over South Carolina on the next day, supported by the merger of two [[cold-core low|troughs aloft]]. Sliding southeast of New England, the new storm [[Explosive cyclogenesis|explosively deepened]] to become a full-fledged [[nor'easter]], with a minimum central air pressure of 966 [[bar (unit)|mbar]]. It began to weaken over the [[Canadian Maritimes]]. 

Widespread blizzard conditions wrought havoc on transportation; streets and highways throughout the hardest-hit areas were clogged with stalled and abandoned vehicles, and multiple major airports were forced to close. Many schools and businesses were closed, some for days after the storm departed. The [[New York Stock Exchange]] opened an hour late on December 12, marking its first delayed opening in over 25&nbsp;years. Extensive drifting of snow left communities isolated and unable to receive deliveries of food and heating fuel. Overall, the storm and subsequent cold snap were blamed for at least 286&nbsp;deaths across a wide area, but primarily in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and the New England states. The fatalities resulted from a multitude of tragedies, including automobile and maritime accidents, storm-related fires, [[carbon monoxide poisoning]], over-exertion, and exposure to cold. 

==Meteorological history==
The nor'easter occurred during a positive phase of the [[North Atlantic oscillation]] (NAO),<ref name="k397"/> though negative NAO values are typically considered optimal for snowstorms in the northeastern United States.<ref>Kocin and Uccellini, pp. 34<U+2013>35</ref> It was the first of three severe storms during the 1960<U+2013>1961 winter season.<ref name="k391">Kocin and Uccellini, p. 391</ref>

It originated in an area of low pressure that developed over the western [[Gulf of Mexico]] on December&nbsp;10,<ref name="k391"/> downstream from an [[upper-level low|upper-level cyclone]].<ref name="k397">Kocin and Uccellini, p. 397</ref> The surface low tracked northward to Oklahoma before turning eastward as it gradually intensified.<ref name="k391"/> Simultaneously, a [[Shortwave (meteorology)|shortwave trough]] swung southeastward around the periphery of a large vortex over central and eastern Canada. As the upper low opened up into a negatively tilted trough and began to interact with the northern wave, a secondary surface cyclone developed along a [[weather front|frontal boundary]] over South Carolina late on December&nbsp;11. Almost immediately thereafter, the original low dissipated over West Virginia. Heading toward the northeast, the incipient storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near [[Cape Hatteras]], North Carolina, at 00:00&nbsp;[[Universal Coordinated Time|UTC]] on December&nbsp;12.<ref name="k397"/>

With strong upper-level support<U+2014>including extensive [[positive vorticity advection]] and dual [[Extratropical cyclone#Cyclogenesis|divergent jet streak]] regions<U+2014>the storm explosively intensified into a powerful nor'easter.<ref name="k391"/><ref name="k397"/> From 00:00&nbsp;to 12:00 UTC on December&nbsp;12, the system deepened by 27&nbsp;mbar while moving to a point south of [[Nantucket]].<ref name="k397"/> By contrast, the widely-accepted criterion for "[[explosive deepening|bombogenesis]]" is a 24-mbar central pressure drop in 24&nbsp;hours.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sanders |first=Frederick |author2=Gyakum, John R. |title=Synoptic-Dynamic Climatology of the "Bomb"|journal=Monthly Weather Review |year=1980 |volume=108 |issue=10|pages=1589<U+2013>1606|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1980)108<1589:SDCOT>2.0.CO;2 |url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0493%281980%29108%3C1589%3ASDCOT%3E2.0.CO%3B2 |accessdate=April 28, 2015}}</ref> Its core pressure ultimately fell to 966&nbsp;mbar by 00:00&nbsp;UTC the next day, while located off the coast of southwestern Nova Scotia.<ref name="k397"/><ref name="k398">Kocin and Uccellini, p. 398</ref> A rapidly tightening pressure gradient north of the cyclone generated strong winds throughout coastal New England.<ref name="k391"/> The storm started to slowly weaken as it moved over the [[Canadian Maritimes]] on December&nbsp;13 and&nbsp;14.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[National Weather Service]]|date=December 14, 1960|title=Daily Weather Map|publisher=NOAA Central Library Data Imaging Project|accessdate=April 24, 2015|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/dwm/1960/19601214.djvu}}</ref>

==Impact==
The initial low pressure system yielded minor snow accumulations in a wide swath of the [[Great Plains]] and [[Midwest United States|Midwest]]. The nor'easter itself dropped much more significant snowfall over the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] and New England, with 10&nbsp;in (25&nbsp;cm) or greater amounts reported in 13 states from West Virginia to Maine. As much as 20&nbsp;in (50&nbsp;cm) of snow fell in small areas of northern New Jersey and eastern Massachusetts.<ref name="k391"/> The greatest snowfall total associated with the storm was 21.4&nbsp;in (54.4&nbsp;cm) at [[Newark, New Jersey]], within a southwest&ndash;northeast oriented corridor of especially heavy snow. In some locations in New Jersey, the storm set new daily snowfall records.<ref name="ludlum132"/> Other notable totals include 8.5&nbsp;in (22&nbsp;cm) at [[Washington, D.C.]]; 14.1&nbsp;in (36&nbsp;cm) at [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]]; 14.6&nbsp;in (37&nbsp;cm) at [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]; 17&nbsp;in (44&nbsp;cm) at [[New York City]]; 13.4&nbsp;in (34&nbsp;cm) at [[Hartford, Connecticut]]; 13&nbsp;in (33&nbsp;cm) at [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]; and 14.9&nbsp;in (38&nbsp;cm) at [[Portland, Maine]].<ref name="k391"/> The storm was rated a "major" Category 3 on the [[Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale]] (NESIS), and a "significant" Category 2 on the [[Regional Snowfall Index]] (RSI), an updated counterpart to the NESIS.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|title=The Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale (NESIS)|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=April 24, 2015|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/snow-and-ice/rsi/nesis}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Squires, Michael F., et al.|title=Regional Snowfall Impact Scale|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=April 24, 2015|url=http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cmb/snow-and-ice/rsi/regional-snowfall-impact-scale-27th-iips-v3a.pdf}}</ref> In parts of southern and eastern Virginia, the snow mixed with [[ice pellets|sleet]] and [[freezing rain]], creating particularly treacherous road conditions. Seven deaths and numerous injuries resulted from traffic accidents in the state, primarily in the [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]] areas.<ref name="sd133">Hodges, p. 133</ref>

The heavy snow combined with strong winds to create widespread and dangerous blizzard conditions, worsened by very cold temperatures left in the wake of a prior [[cold front]].
