'''Mary of Teck''' (Victoria Mary Augusta Louise Olga Pauline Claudine Agnes; 26 May 1867 <U+2013> 24 March 1953) was the [[queen consort]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[British Dominions]], and [[Emperor of India|Empress of India]], as the wife of King-Emperor [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]].

Although technically a princess of [[Teck]], in the [[Kingdom of W<U+00FC>rttemberg]], she was born and brought up in the United Kingdom. Her parents were [[Francis, Duke of Teck]], who was of German extraction, and [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge]], a member of the [[British Royal Family]]. To her family, she was informally known as ''May'', after her birth month. At the age of 24 she was betrothed to [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale]], the eldest son of the [[Prince of Wales]], but six weeks after the announcement of the engagement he unexpectedly died of [[pneumonia]]. The following year she became engaged to Albert Victor's next surviving brother, [[George V of the United Kingdom|George]], who subsequently became king. Before her husband's accession she was successively [[Duchess of York]], [[Duchess of Cornwall]] and [[Princess of Wales]]. As his queen consort from 1910, she supported her husband through [[World War I]], his ill-health and major political changes arising from the [[Aftermath of World War I|aftermath of the war]] and the rise of [[socialism]] and [[nationalism]]. After George's death in 1936, her eldest son [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward]] became King-Emperor, but to her dismay he [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] the same year in order to marry twice-divorced [[United States|American]] [[socialite]] Mrs. [[Wallis, Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]]. She supported her second son, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|Albert]], who succeeded to the throne as George VI, until his death in 1952. She died the following year, at the beginning of the reign of her granddaughter, [[Elizabeth II]]. Briefly, there were three queens in the country: Mary; her daughter-in-law, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]]; and [[Elizabeth II]].

==Early life==
Princess Victoria Mary ("May") of Teck was born on 26 May 1867 at [[Kensington Palace]], [[London]]. Her father was Prince [[Francis, Duke of Teck]], the son of [[Duke Alexander of W<U+00FC>rttemberg]] by his [[morganatic marriage|morganatic]] wife, Countess [[Claudine Rh<U+00E9>dey von Kis-Rh<U+00E9>de]]. Her mother was [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge]], the third child and younger daughter of [[Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge]], and [[Princess Augusta of Hesse-Cassel]]. She was baptised in the [[Chapel Royal]] of Kensington Palace on 27 July 1867 by [[Charles Thomas Longley]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and her three godparents were [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|the Prince of Wales]] (later King Edward VII and May's father-in-law), and Princess Augusta, the Duchess of Cambridge.<ref>''[[The Times]] (London)'', Monday, 29 July 1867 p. 12 col. E</ref>

May's upbringing was "merry but fairly strict".<ref name=pope66>Pope-Hennessy, p. 66</ref> She was the eldest of four children, the only girl, and "learned to exercise her native discretion, firmness and tact" by resolving her three younger brothers' petty boyhood squabbles.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, p. 45</ref> They played with their cousins, the children of the Prince of Wales, who were similar in age.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, p. 55</ref> May was educated at home by her mother and governess (as were her brothers until they were sent to boarding schools).<ref>Pope-Hennessy, pp. 68, 76, 123</ref> The Duchess of Teck spent an unusually long time with her children for a lady of her time and class,<ref name=pope66 /> and enlisted May in various charitable endeavours, which included visiting the tenements of the poor.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, p. 68</ref>

Although her mother was a grandchild of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], May was only a minor member of the [[British Royal Family]]. Her father, the Duke of Teck, had no inheritance or wealth, and carried the lower royal style of ''Serene Highness'' because his parents' marriage was [[morganatic]].<ref>Pope-Hennessy, pp. 36<U+2013>37</ref> However, the Duchess of Teck was granted a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliamentary]] [[Annuity (financial contracts)|Annuity]] of [[pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]5000, and received about <U+00A3>4000 a year from her mother, the Duchess of Cambridge.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, p. 114</ref> Despite this, the family was deeply in debt and lived abroad from 1883, in order to economise.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, p. 112</ref> The Tecks travelled throughout Europe, visiting their various relations. They stayed in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], for a time, where May enjoyed visiting the [[art gallery|art galleries]], churches and museums.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, p. 133</ref>

In 1885, the Tecks returned to [[London]], and took up residence at [[White Lodge]], in [[Richmond Park]]. May was close to her mother, and acted as an unofficial secretary, helping to organise parties and social events. She was also close to her aunt, the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (n<U+00E9>e [[Princess Augusta of Cambridge]]), and wrote to her every week. During [[World War I]], the [[Princess Margaret of Connaught|Crown Princess of Sweden]] helped pass letters from May to her aunt, who lived in enemy territory in [[German Empire|Germany]] until her death in 1916.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, pp. 503<U+2013>505</ref>

==Engagements==
[[File:Victoria Mary of Teck.jpg|thumb|left|Princess Victoria Mary shortly before her marriage to the Duke of York in 1893|alt=Young lady in a tightly-corseted dress]]
In December 1891, May was engaged to her [[Cousin|second cousin, once-removed]], [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale]], the eldest son of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|the Prince of Wales]].<ref>May's maternal grandfather, [[Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge]], was a brother of [[Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent]], who was the father of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], Albert Victor's paternal grandmother.</ref> The choice of May as bride for the Duke owed much to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s fondness for her, as well as to her strong character and sense of duty. However, the Duke of Clarence and Avondale died six weeks later during the worldwide [[influenza pandemic]] that swept through Britain in the winter of 1891<U+2013>2.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, p. 201</ref>

Albert Victor's brother, [[George V of the United Kingdom|Prince George, Duke of York]], now second in line to the throne, evidently became close to May during their shared period of mourning, and Queen Victoria still favoured May as a suitable candidate to marry a future king.<ref>Edwards, p. 61</ref> In May 1893, George proposed, and May accepted. They were soon deeply in love, and their marriage was a success. George wrote to May every day they were apart and, unlike his father, never took a mistress.<ref name="dnb">Prochaska, Frank (September 2004; online edition January 2008), [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34914 "Mary (1867<U+2013>1953)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, [[doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/34914]], retrieved 1 May 2010</ref>

==Duchess of York==
{{See also|Wedding of Prince George, Duke of York, and Princess Mary of Teck|Wedding dress of Princess Mary of Teck}}
May married Prince George, Duke of York, on 6 July 1893 at the [[Chapel Royal]], [[St. James's Palace]], in London.<ref>Her bridesmaids were the Princesses [[Maud of Wales|Maud]] and [[Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria of Wales]], [[Princess Victoria Melita of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Victoria Melita]], [[Princess Alexandra of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Alexandra]] and [[Princess Beatrice of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Beatrice of Edinburgh]], [[Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein|Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Princess Margaret of Connaught|Margaret]] and [[Princess Patricia of Connaught|Patricia of Connaught and Strathearn]], and [[Princess Alice of Battenberg|Alice]] and [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]].</ref> The new Duke and Duchess of York lived in [[York Cottage]] on the [[Sandringham House|Sandringham Estate]] in [[Norfolk]], and in apartments in St. James's Palace. York Cottage was a modest house for royalty, but it was a favourite of George, who liked a relatively simple life.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, p. 291</ref> They had six children: [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward]], [[George VI of the United Kingdom|Albert]], [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Mary]], [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|Henry]], [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|George]], and [[Prince John of the United Kingdom|John]].

[[File:Mary of Teck 4.jpg|thumb|right|Princess Victoria Mary, The Duchess of Cornwall and York. Ottawa, 1901|alt=Thin lady wearing a formal dress, a rope of pearls and a tiara]]

The Duchess loved her children, but she put them in the care of a nanny, as was usual in upper-class families at the time. The first nanny was dismissed for insolence and the second for abusing the children. This second woman, anxious to suggest that the children preferred her to anyone else, would pinch Edward and Albert whenever they were about to be presented to their parents, so that they would start crying and be speedily returned to her. On discovery, she was replaced by her effective and much-loved assistant, Mrs. Bill.<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 16<U+2013>17</ref>

Sometimes, Queen Mary appears to have been a distant mother. At first, she failed to notice the nanny's abuse of the young Princes Edward and Albert,<ref>Pope-Hennessy, p. 393</ref> and her youngest son, Prince John, was housed in a private farm on the Sandringham Estate, in the care of Mrs. Bill, perhaps to hide his [[epilepsy]] from the public. However, despite her austere public image and her strait-laced private life, Mary was a caring mother in many respects, revealing a fun-loving and frivolous side to her children and teaching them history and music. Edward wrote fondly of his mother in his memoirs: "Her soft voice, her cultivated mind, the cosy room overflowing with personal treasures were all inseparable ingredients of the happiness associated with this last hour of a child's day&nbsp;... Such was my mother's pride in her children that everything that happened to each one was of the utmost importance to her. With the birth of each new child, Mama started an album in which she painstakingly recorded each progressive stage of our childhood".<ref>Windsor, pp. 24<U+2013>25</ref> He expressed a less charitable view, however, in private letters to his wife after his mother's death: "My sadness was mixed with incredulity that any mother could have been so hard and cruel towards her eldest son for so many years and yet so demanding at the end without relenting a scrap. I'm afraid the fluids in her veins have always been as icy cold as they are now in death."<ref>Ziegler, p. 538</ref>

As Duke and Duchess of York, George and May carried out a variety of public duties. In 1897, she became the Patron of the [[Queen Mother's Clothing Guild|London Needlework Guild]] in succession to her mother. The Guild, initially established as The London Guild in 1882, was renamed several times, and was named after Mary between 1914 and 2010.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.qmcg.org.uk/|title=Queen Mother's Clothing Guild official website|accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref>

On 22 January 1901, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] died, and May's father-in-law, Albert Edward, ascended the throne as [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]]. For most of the rest of that year, George and May were styled ''TRH The Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York''. For eight months they toured the [[British Empire]], visiting [[Gibraltar]], [[Malta]], [[Egypt]], [[Ceylon]], [[Singapore]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Mauritius]], [[South Africa]] and [[Canada]]. No royal had undertaken such an ambitious tour before. She broke down in tears at the thought of leaving her children, who were to be left in the care of their grandparents, for such a lengthy period of time.<ref>Edwards, p. 115</ref>

==Princess of Wales==
[[File:PrincessofWales1902.jpg|thumb|left|The Princess of Wales at court, 1902|alt=Thin lady wearing a formal dress, a rope of pearls and a tiara]]
On 9 November 1901, nine days after arriving back in Britain and on the King's sixtieth birthday, George was created [[Prince of Wales]]. The family moved their London residence from St James's Palace to [[Marlborough House]]. As Princess of Wales, May accompanied her husband on trips to [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of W<U+00FC>rttemberg|W<U+00FC>rttemberg]] in 1904. The following year, she gave birth to her last child, John. It was a difficult labour, and although May recovered quickly, her newborn son suffered respiratory problems.<ref>Edwards, pp. 142<U+2013>143</ref>

From October 1905 the Prince and Princess of Wales undertook another eight month tour, this time of [[India]], and the children were once again left in the care of their grandparents.<ref>Edwards, p. 146</ref> They passed through [[Egypt]] both ways and on the way back stopped in [[Greece]]. The tour was almost immediately followed by a trip to [[Spain]] for the wedding of [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII]] to [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]], at which the bride and groom narrowly avoided assassination.<ref>The driver of their coach and over a dozen spectators were killed by a bomb thrown by an [[anarchist]], [[Mateu Morral|Mateo Morales]].</ref> Only a week after returning to Britain, May and George went to [[Norway]] for the coronation of [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]] and [[Maud of Wales|Queen Maud]] (George's sister).

==Queen consort==
[[File:Mary of Teck 3.jpg|thumb|right|King George V and Queen Mary|alt=Late-middle-aged couple in crowns and ermine capes stand on a dais]]
[[File:Queen Mary and Princess Mary.jpg|left|thumbnail|Queen Mary with her daughter Princess Mary during World War I.]] On 6 May 1910, Edward VII died. The Prince of Wales ascended the throne as [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], and Mary became queen consort. When her husband asked her to drop one of her two official names, Victoria Mary, she chose to be called Mary, preferring not to take the name of her husband's grandmother, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].<ref>Pope-Hennessy, p. 421</ref> Queen Mary was crowned with the King on 22 June 1911 at [[Westminster Abbey]]. Later in the year, the new King and Queen travelled to [[India]] for the [[Delhi Durbar]] held on 12 December 1911, and toured the sub-continent as Emperor and Empress of India, returning to Britain in February.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, pp. 452<U+2013>463</ref> The beginning of Mary's period as consort brought her into conflict with the Dowager [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]]. Although the two were on friendly terms, Alexandra could be stubborn; she demanded precedence over Mary at the funeral of Edward VII, was slow in leaving [[Buckingham Palace]], and kept some of the royal jewels that should have been passed to the new queen.<ref>Edwards, pp. 182<U+2013>193</ref>

During [[World War I]], Queen Mary instituted an austerity drive at the palace, where she rationed food, and visited wounded and dying servicemen in hospital, which she found a great emotional strain.<ref>Edwards, pp. 244<U+2013>245</ref> After three years of war against [[German Empire|Germany]], and with anti-German feeling in Britain running high, the [[Russian Imperial Family]], which had been deposed by a revolutionary government, was refused asylum, possibly in part because the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]]'s wife was German-born.<ref>Edwards, p. 258</ref> News of the Tsar's abdication provided a boost to those in Britain who wished to replace the monarchy with a republic.<ref>Edwards, p. 262</ref> After republicans used the couple's German heritage as an argument for reform, George abandoned his German titles and renamed the Royal House from the German "[[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]" to the English "[[House of Windsor|Windsor]]". Other royals anglicised their names; the [[Battenberg family|Battenbergs]] became the [[Mountbatten]]s, for example. The Queen's relatives also abandoned their German titles, and adopted the British surname of Cambridge (derived from the Dukedom held by Queen Mary's British grandfather). The war ended in 1918 with the defeat of Germany and the abdication and exile of the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser]].
{{Teck-Cambridge Family}}
Two months after the end of the war, Queen Mary's youngest son, John, died at the age of thirteen. She described her shock and sorrow in her diary and letters, extracts of which were published after her death: "our poor darling little Johnnie had passed away suddenly&nbsp;... The first break in the family circle is hard to bear but people have been so kind & sympathetic & this has helped us [the King and me] much."<ref>Pope-Hennessy, p. 511</ref> Her staunch support of her husband continued during the latter half of his reign. She advised him on speeches, and used her extensive knowledge of history and royalty to advise him on certain matters affecting his position. He appreciated her discretion, intelligence and judgement.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, p. 549</ref> She maintained an air of self-assured calm throughout all her public engagements in the years after the war, a period marked by civil unrest over social conditions, [[Irish War of Independence|Irish independence]] and [[Indian nationalism]].<ref>Edwards, p. 311</ref>

In the late 1920s, George V became increasingly ill with lung problems, exacerbated by his heavy smoking. Queen Mary paid particular attention to his care. During his illness in 1928, one of his doctors, Sir [[Farquhar Buzzard]], was asked who had saved the King's life. He replied, "The Queen".<ref>Gore, p. 243</ref> In 1935, King George V and Queen Mary celebrated their [[silver jubilee]], with celebrations taking place throughout the [[British Empire]]. In his jubilee speech, George paid public tribute to his wife, having told his speechwriter, "Put that paragraph at the very end. I cannot trust myself to speak of the Queen when I think of all I owe her."<ref>''The Times (London)'', Wednesday, 25 March 1953 p. 5</ref>

==Queen Mother==
George V died on 20 January 1936, after his physician, [[Bertrand Dawson, 1st Viscount Dawson of Penn|Lord Dawson of Penn]], gave him an injection of [[morphine]] and [[cocaine]] which may have hastened his death.<ref>{{citation|first=Francis |last=Watson|title=The Death of George V|journal=History Today|year=1986|volume=36|pages=21<U+2013>30}}</ref> Queen Mary's eldest son, [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]], ascended the throne as Edward VIII. She was now officially [[Queen Mother]], though she did not use that title and was instead known as ''Her Majesty'' '''Queen Mary'''.

Within the year, Edward caused a [[constitutional crisis]] by announcing his desire to marry his twice-divorced American mistress, Mrs. [[Wallis Simpson]]. Queen Mary disapproved of divorce, which was against the teaching of the [[Church of England|Anglican Church]], and thought Mrs. Simpson wholly unsuitable to be the wife of a king. After receiving advice from the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[Stanley Baldwin]], as well as the [[British Dominions|Dominion]] governments, that he could not remain king and marry Mrs. Simpson, Edward [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]]. Though loyal and supportive of her son, Queen Mary could not comprehend why Edward would neglect his royal duties in favour of his personal feelings.<ref>Airlie, p. 200</ref> Mrs. Simpson had been presented formally to both King George V and Queen Mary at court,<ref>Windsor, p. 255</ref> but Queen Mary later refused to meet her either in public or privately.<ref>Windsor, p. 334</ref> Queen Mary saw it as her duty to provide moral support for her second son, the reserved and stammering [[George VI of the United Kingdom|Prince Albert, Duke of York]], who ascended the throne upon Edward's abdication, taking the name George VI. When Mary attended the coronation, she became the first British [[Queen Dowager|dowager queen]] ever to do so.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, p. 584</ref> Edward's abdication did not lessen her love for him, but she never wavered in her disapproval of the damage she believed had been done to the Crown.<ref name="dnb" /><ref>Edwards, p. 401 and Pope-Hennessy, p. 575</ref>

[[File:Queen Mary with Princess Elizabeth and Margaret.jpg|thumb|left|Queen Mary with her granddaughters, Princesses [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]] (front) and [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth]]|alt=Elderly lady and two girls in formal dress]]

Queen Mary took an interest in the upbringing of her granddaughters, Princesses [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]], and took them on various excursions in London, to art galleries and museums. (The Princesses' own parents thought it unnecessary for them to be taxed with any demanding educational regime.)<ref>Edwards, p. 349</ref>

During [[World War II]], George VI wished his mother to be evacuated from London. Although she was reluctant, she decided to live at [[Badminton House]], [[Gloucestershire]], with her niece, [[Mary Somerset, Duchess of Beaufort]], the daughter of her brother, [[Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge|Lord Cambridge]].<ref>Pope-Hennessy, p. 596</ref> Her personal belongings were transported from London in seventy pieces of luggage. Her household, which comprised fifty-five servants, occupied most of the house, except for the Duke and Duchess's private suites, until after the war. The only people to complain about the arrangements were the royal servants, who found the house too small,<ref>{{citation|last=Mosley|first=Charles (ed.)|title=Burke's Peerage & Gentry, 107th edition|year=2003|pages=vol. I p. 308|chapter=Duke of Beaufort, 'Seat' section|nopp=true}}</ref> though Queen Mary annoyed her niece by having the ancient ivy torn from the walls as she considered it unattractive and a hazard. From Badminton, in support of the war effort, she visited troops and factories, and directed the gathering of scrap materials. She was known to offer lifts to soldiers she spotted on the roads.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, p. 600</ref> In 1942, her youngest surviving son, [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]], was killed in an air crash while on active service. Queen Mary finally returned to [[Marlborough House]] in June 1945, after the war in Europe had resulted in the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]].

Queen Mary was an eager collector of objects and pictures with a royal connection.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, p. 412</ref> She paid above-market estimates when purchasing jewels from the estate of [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dowager Empress Marie of Russia]]<ref>{{citation|last=Clarke|first=William|title=The Lost Fortune Of The Tsars|year=1995}}</ref> and paid almost three times the estimate when buying the family's Cambridge Emeralds from Lady Kilmorey, the mistress of her late brother [[Prince Francis of Teck|Prince Francis]].<ref>{{citation|author=Thomson, Mark|title=Document <U+2013> A Right Royal Affair|publisher=BBC Radio 4|date= 29 August 2005}}<br />See also [http://www.proni.gov.uk/records/private/kilmorey.htm#4thearl Kilmorey Papers (D/2638)], [[Public Record Office of Northern Ireland]].</ref> In 1924, the famous architect [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]] created [[Queen Mary's Dolls' House]] for her collection of miniature pieces.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, pp. 531<U+2013>534</ref> Indeed, she has sometimes been criticised for her aggressive acquisition of ''objets d'art'' for the [[Royal Collection]]. On several occasions, she would express to hosts, or others, that she admired something they had in their possession, in the expectation that the owner would be willing to donate it.<ref>Rose, p. 284</ref> Her extensive knowledge of, and research into, the Royal Collection helped in identifying artefacts and artwork that had gone astray over the years.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, p. 414</ref> The Royal Family had lent out many objects over previous generations. Once she had identified unreturned items through old inventories, she would write to the holders, requesting that they be returned.<ref>Windsor, p. 238</ref>

In 1952, King George VI died, the third of Queen Mary's children to predecease her; her eldest granddaughter, Princess Elizabeth, ascended the throne as Queen Elizabeth II. Queen Mary died the next year of [[lung cancer]] (referred to publicly as "gastric problems"<ref>''The Times (London)'', Wednesday, 25 March 1953 p. 8</ref>) at the age of 85, only ten weeks before Elizabeth's [[coronation]]. Queen Mary let it be known that, in the event of her death, the coronation was not to be postponed. Her remains [[Lying in State|lay in state]] at [[Westminster Hall]], where large numbers of mourners filed past her coffin. She is buried beside her husband in the nave of [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/about-st-georges/royal-connection/burial/burials-in-the-chapel-by-location.html|title=Royal Burials in the Chapel by location|publisher=St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref>
