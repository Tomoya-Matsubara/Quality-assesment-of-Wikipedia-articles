"'''Secret'''" is a song by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], released as the first single from her 1994 album ''[[Bedtime Stories (Madonna album)|Bedtime Stories]]''. It was released in September 1994 and became a top ten hit around the world, including reaching number three in the United States and five in the UK. It was later included on her greatest hits compilations ''[[GHV2]]'' (2001) and ''[[Celebration (Madonna album)|Celebration]]'' (2009).

==Song information==
"Secret" was originally written and produced by Madonna with [[Shep Pettibone]], who she had collaborated with on the 1992 album ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]''. On release, the song was credited to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Dallas Austin]]. Pettibone was not acknowledged as co-writer until the release of a 2001 remix compilation album ''[[GHV2#GHV2 Remixed: The Best of 1991<U+2013>2001|GHV2 Remixed: The Best of 1991-2001]]''.

Musically, "Secret" is in the key of [[E-flat minor]].<ref name="fpsec">[http://forpiano.com/FILES/secret__madonna.pdf Secret] ''For Piano'' Retrieved 2008-05-18</ref> According to [[The Official Charts Company]], "Secret" has sold 117,957&nbsp;copies in the United Kingdom, as of August 2008.<ref name="imma">{{cite news|url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=22&storycode=1035210|last=Jones|first=Alan|title=The Immaculate Guide To 50 Years Of Madonna|date=2008-08-19|accessdate=2011-06-11|work=[[Music Week]]|publisher=[[UBM plc]]}}</ref>

Unusual for the mid-90's, Madonna promoted this song on the [[Internet]], with a 30-second sample of "Secret" and the cover image of the then-unreleased ''Bedtime Stories''. She also left a message with the following words:<ref>{{cite video |people=Madonna (performer), Joe Barco |date=14 September 1994|title=Madonna talks about her then-new song "Secret" |url=http://mlvc.org/digests/v03/September/v03.n046 |publisher=mlvc.org |accessdate=2008-12-23 |quote=Hello, all you Cyberheads!... }}</ref>

{{cquote|Hello, all you Cyberheads! Welcome to the 90's version of intimacy. You can hear me... You can even see me... But you can't touch me... do you recognize my voice?... It's Madonna. Often imitated, but never duplicated. Or, should I say, often irritated?

If you feel like it, you can download the sound file of my new single "Secret", from my new album, "Bedtime Stories", which comes out next month. I just shot the video in New York, and will be premiering an exclusive sample of it online. So check back soon. In the meantime, why don't you post me a message and let me know what you think of my new song. And by the way, don't believe any of those online imposters pretending to be me... ain't nothing like the real thing.

Peace out.}}

The last part of her message referred to a brief trend of [[AOL]] [[chatroom]] users impersonating her; this was confirmed by [[MTV News]].

The song was performed on tour for the first time during her 2001 [[Drowned World Tour]]. It was later performed at the [[Houston]] stop of her [[Sticky and Sweet Tour]] in November, 2008, as a fan request. [[Slant Magazine]] listed "Secret" as the 42nd "Best Singles of the '90s".<ref>http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/feature/best-singles-of-the-90s/247/page_6</ref>

==Music video==
[[File:Secretmusicvideo.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Madonna in the "Secret" music video, singing in a club]]The black and white [[music video]] was directed by photographer Melodie McDaniel and was filmed on September 9, 10, 11, 1994 at the [[Lenox Lounge]] an on location on Lenox Avenue in [[Harlem]], [[New York]]. The video starts with Madonna singing in a club. As the song progresses, she walks down a street and ultimately reaches her home to her boyfriend or husband and a child. Scenes of Madonna are interspersed with scenes of transvestites getting ready, and religious iconography such as rebirth and damnation.

An official remix video was edited by Dan-O-Rama and is known as "Secret (Dan-O-Rama Remix)" - it includes the remix "Junior's Luscious Club Edit" by [[Junior Vasquez]].
