'''Bob Dylan''' (born '''Robert Allen Zimmerman''', [[May 24]], [[1941]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[singer-songwriter]], [[author]], [[musician]], [[poet]], and, of late, [[disc jockey]] who has been a major figure in [[popular music]] for five decades. Much of Dylan's most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when he became an informal chronicler and a reluctant [[Figurehead (metaphor)|figurehead]] of American unrest. A number of his songs, such as "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]" and "[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]",<ref>{{cite news

His most recent studio album, ''[[Modern Times (Bob Dylan album)|Modern Times]]'', released on [[August 29]], [[2006]], entered the U.S. [[album charts]] at #1, making him, at age 65, the oldest living person to top those charts.<ref>{{cite news

Dylan's early lyrics incorporated [[politics]], [[social commentary]], [[philosophy]] and [[literature|literary]] influences, defying existing [[pop music]] conventions and appealing widely to the [[counterculture]] of the time.  While expanding and personalizing musical styles, he has shown steadfast devotion to many traditions of American song, from [[folk music|folk]] and [[American country music|country]]/[[blues]] to [[gospel music|gospel]], [[rock and roll]] and [[rockabilly]], to [[England|English]], [[Scotland|Scottish]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] folk music, even [[jazz]] and [[swing (genre)|swing]].<ref>{{cite web

Dylan performs with the [[guitar]], [[electronic keyboard|keyboard]] and [[harmonica]]. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the "[[Never Ending Tour]]". He has also performed alongside other major artists, such as [[John Fogerty]], [[The Band]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Joan Baez]], [[George Harrison]], [[The Grateful Dead]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[U2]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Jack White]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Jeff Lynne]], [[Neil Young]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Stevie Nicks]].  Although his accomplishments as performer and recording artist have been central to his career, his songwriting is generally regarded as his greatest contribution.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/time100/artists/profile/dylan.html

Over many years, Dylan has been recognized and honored for his songwriting, performing, and recording. His records have earned [[Grammy]], [[Golden Globe]], and [[Academy Award]]s, and he has been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. In 1999, Dylan was included in [[TIME Magazine's 100 most influential people of the 20th century]], and 2004, he was ranked #2 in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of "[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty/100 Greatest Artists of All Time]", second only to [[The Beatles]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Bob Dylan | work = Robbie Robertson.

==Life and career== 
===Origins and musical beginnings===

'''Robert Allen Zimmerman''' (Jewish name: Zushe ben Avraham)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/news/article.htm/aid/573406/jewish/SingerSongwriter-Bob-Dylan-Joins-Yom-Kippur-Services-in-Atlanta.html|publisher=chabad|title=Singer/Songwriter Bob Dylan Joins Yom Kippur Services in Atlanta|accessdate=2007-11-07}}</ref><ref>but see Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p.14, who gives his Hebrew name as Shabtai Zisel ben Avraham and other sources which include the matronym v'Rachel Riva</ref> was born on [[May 24]], [[1941]], in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]], [[Minnesota]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.infoplease.com/biography/var/bobdylan.html | title = Bob Dylan | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}</ref> and raised there and in [[Hibbing, Minnesota]], on the [[Mesabi Iron Range]] west of [[Lake Superior]].  Research by Dylan<U+2019>s biographers has shown that his paternal grandparents, Zigman and Anna Zimmerman, emigrated from [[Odessa]] in [[Ukraine]] to the United States after the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] [[pogrom]]s of 1905.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p.12-13</ref> Dylan himself has written (in his 2004 autobiography, ''[[Chronicles, Vol. 1|Chronicles]]'') that his paternal grandmother's maiden name was [[Kyrgyz]] and her family originated from [[Istanbul]], although she grew up in the [[Ka<U+011F><U+0131>zman]] district of [[Kars]] in Eastern [[Turkey]]. He also wrote that his paternal grandfather was from [[Trabzon]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast of [[Turkey]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Dylan |first=Bob |authorlink=Bob Dylan |title= "Chronicles, Volume One" |year=2004 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |isbn=0306812312  |pages=92<U+2013>93}}</ref> His mother<U+2019>s grandparents, Benjamin and Lybba Edelstein, were [[Lithuanian Jews]] who arrived in America in 1902.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p.12-13</ref>

His parents, Abram Zimmerman and Beatrice "Beatty" Stone, were part of the area's small but close-knit Jewish community.  Zimmerman lived in Duluth until age seven. When his father was stricken with [[polio]], the family returned to nearby [[Hibbing, Minnesota|Hibbing]], where Zimmerman spent the rest of his childhood.<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', 25<U+2013>33</ref> Abram was recalled by one of Bob's childhood friends as strict and unwelcoming, whereas his mother was remembered as warm and friendly.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gill (with Kevin Odegard) |first=Andy |authorlink=Andy Gill |title= "A Simple Twist of Fate: Bob Dylan and the Making of Blood on the Tracks" |year=2004 |publisher=[[Da Capo]] |isbn=0743230760  |pages=99}}</ref>

Zimmerman spent much of his youth listening to the radio <U+2014> first to the powerful [[blues]] and [[American country music|country]] stations broadcasting from [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] and, later, to early [[rock and roll]].<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', 38<U+2013>39.</ref> He formed several bands in high school: the first, The Shadow Blasters, was short-lived; but his next band, The Golden Chords, lasted longer playing [[Cover version|covers]] of popular songs.

Zimmerman enrolled at the [[University of Minnesota]] in September 1959, moving to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]].  His early focus on rock and roll gave way to an interest in American folk music, typically performed with an acoustic guitar. He has recalled, "The first thing that turned me onto folk singing was [[Odetta]]. I heard a record of hers in a record store. Right then and there, I went out and traded my electric guitar and amplifier for an acoustical guitar, a flat-top Gibson."<ref>[http://www.interferenza.com/bcs/interw/play78.htm ''Playboy'' interview with Bob Dylan, March 1978]</ref>  In the sleeve notes to his album ''[[Biograph]]'', Dylan explained the attraction folk music exerted: "The thing about rock'n'roll is that for me anyway it wasn't enough...There were great catch-phrases and driving pulse rhythms...but the songs weren't serious or didn't reflect life in a realistic way. I knew that when I got into folk music, it was more of a serious type of thing. The songs are filled with more despair, more sadness, more triumph, more faith in the supernatural, much deeper feelings."<ref>[[Biograph (album)]], 1985,  Liner notes & text by [[Cameron Crowe]].</ref>   He soon began to perform at the 10 O'clock Scholar, a coffee house a few blocks from campus, and became actively involved in the local [[Dinkytown, USA|Dinkytown]] [[folk music]] circuit, fraternizing with local folk enthusiasts and occasionally "borrowing" many of their albums.<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', 65<U+2013>82</ref><ref name = "No Direction Home">''[[No Direction Home]]''. [[Paramount Pictures]]. Directed by [[Martin Scorsese]]. Released [[July 21]] [[2005]].</ref>

During his Dinkytown days, Zimmerman began introducing himself as "Bob Dylan". In his autobiography, ''Chronicles'' (2004), he wrote, "What I was going to do as soon as I left home was just call myself Robert Allen.... It sounded like a Scottish king and I liked it." However, by reading ''Downbeat'' magazine, he discovered that there was already a saxophonist called David Allyn.  Around the same time, he became acquainted with the poetry of [[Dylan Thomas]].  Zimmerman felt he had to choose between Robert Allyn and Robert Dylan. "I couldn't decide <U+2014> the letter D came on stronger", he explained. He decided on "Bob" because there were several Bobbies in popular music at the time.<ref>Dylan, ''Chronicles, Vol. 1'', 78<U+2013>79.</ref>

===Relocation to New York and record deal===

Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his freshman year.  He stayed in Minneapolis, working the folk circuit there with temporary journeys to [[Denver, Colorado]]; [[Madison, Wisconsin]]; and [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]. In January 1961, he moved to [[New York City]], to perform there and to visit his ailing musical idol [[Woody Guthrie]], who was then dying in a New Jersey [[Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital|hospital]]. Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and was the biggest influence on his early performances. Dylan would later say of Guthrie's work, "You could listen to his songs and actually learn how to live."<ref name = "No Direction Home" />  In the hospital room, Dylan met Woody's old road-buddy [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], who was visiting Guthrie the day after returning from his own trip to Europe. Dylan and Elliott became friends, and much of Guthrie's repertoire was actually channeled <!-- into Dylan's?? --> through Elliott.  Dylan paid tribute to Elliott in ''[[Chronicles, Vol. 1|Chronicles]]'' (2004).<ref>Dylan, ''Chronicles, Vol. 1'', 250<U+2013>252.</ref>

From April to September 1961, he played at various clubs around [[Greenwich Village]] <ref>{{cite web

Also in September, Dylan was invited to play harmonica by folk singer [[Carolyn Hester]] on her third album, entitled ''Carolyn Hester''. This brought Dylan's talents to the attention of [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]], who was producing Hester's album<ref> Unterberger, Richie. [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:jifpxqq5ld6e~T1],  "allmusic". Accessed [[June 30]] [[2007]]. </ref> for [[Columbia Records]]. Hammond signed Dylan to Columbia that October. The performances on his first Columbia album ''[[Bob Dylan (album)|Bob Dylan]]'' (1962), consisted of familiar folk, blues and [[gospel music|gospel]] material combined with two of his own songs.  Dylan's first album made little impact, selling only 5,000 copies in its first year, just enough to break even.  Within [[Columbia Records]] some referred to the singer as 'Hammond's Folly' and suggested dropping his contract. Hammond defended Dylan vigorously, and [[Johnny Cash]] was also a powerful ally of Dylan at Columbia.<ref>[[Anthony Scaduto|Scaduto]], ''Bob Dylan'', 110</ref>  While Dylan continued to work for Columbia, he also recorded more than a dozen songs, under the pseudonym Blind Boy Grunt, for ''[[Broadside Magazine]]'', a folk music magazine and record label.  

Dylan made two important career moves in August 1962.  He went to the [[New York Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] building in New York and changed his name to Robert Dylan.  In the same month, he also signed a management contract with [[Albert Grossman]].  Grossman remained Dylan's manager until 1970, and was notable both for his sometimes confrontational personality, and for the fiercely protective loyalty he displayed towards his principal client.<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 283<U+2013>4</ref>  In the documentary ''[[No Direction Home]]'', Dylan described Grossman thus: "He was kind of like a [[Colonel Tom Parker]] figure...you could smell him coming."

By the time Dylan's second album, ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'', was released in May 1963, he had begun making his name as both a singer and a songwriter. Many of the songs on this album were labelled [[protest song]]s, inspired partly by Guthrie and influenced by [[Pete Seeger]]'s passion for topical songs.<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', 138<U+2013>142</ref> "Oxford Town", for example, was a sardonic account of [[James Meredith]]'s ordeal as the first black student to risk enrollment at the [[University of Mississippi]].<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', 156</ref>

His most famous song of the time, "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]", partially derived its melody from the traditional [[slave]] song "No More Auction Block", while its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo. The song was widely recorded and became an international hit for [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], setting a precedent for many other artists who would have hits with Dylan's songs. While Dylan's topical songs solidified his early reputation, ''Freewheelin''' also included a mixture of love songs and jokey, surreal talking blues. Humor was a large part of Dylan's persona,<ref>[[Anthony Scaduto|Scaduto]], ''Bob Dylan'', 35</ref> and the range of material on the album impressed many listeners, including [[The Beatles]]. [[George Harrison]] said, "We just played it, just wore it out. The content of the song lyrics and just the attitude <U+2014> it was incredibly original and wonderful."<ref>''Mojo'' magazine, December 1993</ref> 
[[Image:Joan Baez Bob Dylan.jpg|thumb|With [[Joan Baez]] during the Civil Rights March in [[Washington, D.C.]], August 28, 1963]]

The ''Freewheelin''' song "[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]", built melodically from a loose adaptation of the folk [[ballad]] "[[Lord Randall]]", with its veiled references to [[nuclear warfare|nuclear]] [[apocalypse]], gained even more resonance as the [[Cuban Missile Crisis|Cuban missile crisis]] developed only a few weeks after Dylan began performing it.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 101<U+2013>103</ref> Like "Blowin' in the Wind", "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" marked an important new direction in modern songwriting, blending a [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream-of-consciousness]], [[imagist]] lyrical attack with traditional folk progressions.<ref>Ricks, ''Dylan's Visions of Sin'', 329<U+2013>44.</ref>

The ''Freewheelin'' album presented Dylan as a singer accompanying himself on acoustic guitar. But other tracks recorded at these sessions, with a backing band, showed a willingness to experiment with a [[rockabilly]] sound. 'Mixed Up Confusion' was released as a single and then quickly withdrawn. [[Cameron Crowe]] described it as "a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Sun Records]]".<ref>[[Biograph (album)]], 1985,  Liner notes & text by [[Cameron Crowe]]. Musicians on 'Mixed Up Confusion': George Barnes & [[Bruce Langhorne]] (guitars); Dick Wellstood (piano); George Ramey (bass); Herb Lovelle (drums)</ref>  
 
Soon after the release of ''Freewheelin'', Dylan emerged as a dominant figure of the so-called "new folk movement" centered in [[Greenwich Village]].  Dylan's singing voice was untrained and had an unusual edge to it, yet it was suited to the interpretation of traditional songs. Robert Shelton described Dylan's vocal style as "a rusty voice suggesting Guthrie's old performances, etched in gravel like [[Dave Van Ronk]]'s"<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', 108<U+2013>111</ref>  Many of his most famous early songs first reached the public through other performers' versions that were more immediately palatable. [[Joan Baez]] became Dylan's advocate, as well as his lover.  Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to national and international prominence, jumpstarting his performance career by inviting him onstage during her own concerts, and recording several of his early songs.<ref>Joan Baez entry, Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 28<U+2013>31</ref>

Others who recorded and had hits with Dylan's songs in the early and mid-1960s included [[The Byrds]], [[Sonny and Cher]], [[The Hollies]], [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], [[Manfred Mann]], and [[The Turtles]]. Most attempted to impart a pop feel and rhythm to the songs, while Dylan and Baez performed them mostly as sparse folk pieces, keying rhythmically off the vocals. The covers became so ubiquitous that [[CBS]] started to promote him with the tag "Nobody Sings Dylan Like Dylan".

===Protest and ''Another Side''===
[[Image:Bob Dylan in November 1963.jpg|thumb|Bob Dylan performing at [[St. Lawrence University]] in New York, 1963.]][[Image:Bob Dylan in November 1963-5.jpg|thumb|Bob Dylan performing at [[St. Lawrence University]] in New York, 1963.]]By 1963, Dylan and Baez were both prominent in the [[civil rights]] movement, singing together at rallies including the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] where [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] gave his "[[I have a dream]]" speech.<ref>Dylan performed [[Only a Pawn in Their Game]] and [[When the Ship Comes In]]</ref>  In January, Dylan appeared on British television in the [[BBC]] play '' [[Madhouse on Castle Street]]'', playing the part of a "hobo guitar-player".<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref>  On May 12, 1963, Dylan experienced conflict with the media when he walked off the [[Ed Sullivan Show]].  Dylan had chosen to perform "Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues" but was informed by the 'head of program practices' at [[CBS Television]] that this song was potentially libellous to the [[John Birch Society]].  Rather than comply with TV censorship, Dylan refused to appear.<ref>Dylan had recorded the song for his [[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan|Freewheelin']] album, but the song was replaced by later compositions, including "[[Masters of War]]". see Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 114<U+2013>115 </ref>  His next album, ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin']]'', reflected a more sophisticated, politicized and cynical Dylan.  This bleak material, addressing such subjects as the murder of civil rights worker [[Medgar Evers]] and the despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities ("Ballad of Hollis Brown", "[[North Country Blues]]"), was accompanied by two love songs, "Boots of Spanish Leather" and "One Too Many Mornings", and the renunciation of "Restless Farewell". The [[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] "[[The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll]]" describes the true story of a young socialite's ([[William Zantzinger]]) killing of a hotel maid ([[Hattie Carroll]]). Though never explicitly mentioning their respective races, the song leaves no doubt that the killer is white and the victim is black.<ref>Ricks, ''Dylan's Visions of Sin'', 221<U+2013>233</ref> 

By the end of 1963, Dylan felt both manipulated and constrained by the folk and protest movements. Accepting the "[[Thomas Paine|Tom Paine]] Award" from the [[National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee]] at a ceremony shortly after the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]], a drunken, rambling Dylan questioned the role of the committee, insulted its members as old and balding, and claimed to see something of himself (and of every man) in Kennedy's alleged assassin, [[Lee Harvey Oswald]].<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', 200<U+2013>205</ref>

His next album, ''[[Another Side of Bob Dylan]]'', recorded on a single June evening in 1964, had a lighter mood than its predecessor.  The surreal Dylan reemerged on "I Shall Be Free #10" and "Motorpsycho Nightmare", accompanied by a sense of humour that has often reappeared over the years. "[[Spanish Harlem Incident]]" and "[[To Ramona]]" are romantic and passionate love songs, while "[[Black Crow Blues]]" and "[[I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)]]" suggest the rock and roll soon to dominate Dylan's music. "It Ain't Me Babe", on the surface a song about spurned love, has been described as a thinly disguised rejection of the role his reputation had thrust at him. His newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs: the [[impressionism|impressionistic]] "[[Chimes of Freedom]]", which sets elements of social commentary against a denser metaphorical landscape in a style later characterized by [[Allen Ginsberg]] as "chains of flashing images"; and "[[My Back Pages]]", which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs and seems to predict the backlash he was about to encounter from his former champions as he took a new direction.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 160<U+2013>161 [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]] sang harmony on the [[Another Side of Bob Dylan]] version of [[Mr. Tambourine Man]].</ref>

During 1964 and 1965, Dylan<U+2019>s appearance changed rapidly, as he made his move from leading contemporary song-writer of the folk scene to rock<U+2019>n<U+2019>roll star.  His scruffy jeans and work shirts were replaced by a [[Carnaby Street]] wardrobe. A London reporter wrote: <U+201C>Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge. A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of Leicester Square.

Appearing on the [[Les Crane]] TV show and asked about a movie he was planning to make, he told Crane it would be a cowboy horror movie.

==="Going electric"===
{{main|Electric Dylan controversy}}

His March 1965 album ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'' was yet another stylistic leap.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 181<U+2013>182</ref> The album featured his first recordings made with electric instruments. The first single, "[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]]", owed much to [[Chuck Berry]]'s "Too Much Monkey Business" and was provided with an early [[music video]] courtesy of [[D. A. Pennebaker]]'s [[cin<U+00E9>ma v<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>]] presentation of Dylan's 1965 tour of [[England]], ''[[Dont Look Back]]''.<ref>Gill, ''My Back Pages'', 68<U+2013>69</ref> Its free association lyrics both harked back to the manic energy of Beat poetry and were a forerunner of rap and hip-hop.<ref>Marqusee, ''Wicked Messenger'', 144</ref>  In 1969, the militant [[Weatherman (organization)|Weatherman]] group took their name from a line in "Subterranean Homesick Blues." ("You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.")

The [[B side]] of the album was a different matter. It included four lengthy acoustic songs whose undogmatic political, social, and personal concerns are illuminated with the semi-mystical imagery that became another Dylan trademark.  One of these tracks, "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]", which would become one of his best known songs, had already been a hit for The Byrds; while "Gates of Eden", "[[It's All Over Now Baby Blue]]", and "[[It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]" have been fixtures in Dylan's live performances for most of his career.

That summer Dylan made history by performing his first electric set (since his high school days) with a [[pickup group]] drawn mostly from the [[Paul Butterfield Blues Band]], featuring [[Mike Bloomfield]] (guitar), Sam Lay (drums), Jerome Arnold (bass), plus [[Al Kooper]] (organ) and [[Barry Goldberg]] (piano), while headlining at the [[Newport Folk Festival]] (see ''[[The electric Dylan controversy]]'').<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 208<U+2013>216</ref> Dylan had appeared at Newport twice before, in 1963 and 1964, and two wildly divergent accounts of the crowd's response in 1965 emerged. The settled fact is that Dylan, met with a mix of cheering and booing, left the stage after only three songs. As one version of the legend has it, the boos were from the outraged folk fans whom Dylan had alienated by his electric guitar. An alternative account claims audience members were merely upset by poor sound quality and a surprisingly short set. Whatever sparked the crowd's disfavor, Dylan soon reemerged and sang two much better received solo acoustic numbers, "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" and "Mr. Tambourine Man." His choice of the former has often been described as a carefully selected death knell for the kind of consciously sociopolitical, purely acoustic music that the cat-callers were demanding of him, with "New Folk" in the role of "Baby Blue".

Dylan's 1965 Newport performance provoked an outraged response from the folk music establishment.<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', 305<U+2013>314</ref> [[Ewan MacColl]] wrote in ''[[Sing Out!]],'' "Our traditional songs and ballads are the creations of extraordinarily talented artists working inside traditions formulated over time...  But what of Bobby Dylan?...  Only a non-critical audience, nourished on the watery pap of pop music could have fallen for such tenth-rate drivel." On [[July 29]], just four days after his controversial performance at Newport, Dylan was back into the studio in New York and recorded "Positively 4th Street." The song teemed with images of paranoia and revenge. ("I know the reason/That you talk behind my back/I used to be among the crowd/You're in with.") It was widely interpreted as Dylan's put-down of former friends from the folk community <U+2014> friends he had known in the clubs along West 4th Street.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 186</ref>  

Many in the folk revival had embraced the idea that life equaled art, that a certain kind of life defined by suffering and social exclusion in fact replaced art.<ref>Georgina Boyes: The Imagined Village: Culture, ideology and the English Folk Revival</ref> Folksong collectors and singers often presented folk music as an innocent characteristic of lives lived without reflection or the false consciousness of capitalism.<ref> Greil Marcus: The Old, Weird America, 28</ref>   This philosophy, both genteel and paternalistic, was ultimately what Dylan had run afoul of by 1965. But at an Austin press conference in September of that year, on the day of his first performance with [[Levon and the Hawks]], he described his music not as a pop charts-bound break with the past, but as <U+201C>historical-traditional music.<U+201D><ref> Alan Jacobs: <U+201C>The Songs Are My Lexicon<U+201D> http://www.bobdylan.com/etc/ajacobs.html </ref> Dylan later told interviewer [[Nat Hentoff]]: <U+201C>What folk music is... is based on myths and the Bible and plague and famine and all kinds of things like that which are nothing but mystery and you can see it in all the songs<U+2026>.All these songs about roses growing out of people<U+2019>s brains and lovers who are really geese and swans that turn into angels<U+2026>and seven years of this and eight years of that and it<U+2019>s all really something that nobody can touch.... (the songs) are not going to die.<U+201D><ref> Nat Hentoff, quoted in The Playboy Interview, March 1966; quoted in the Ralph J. Gleason interview, Ramparts, March 1966</ref> It was this mystical, living tradition of songs that served as the palette for ''Bringing It All Back Home'', but in a nod to changing times first openly displayed at Newport, electrically amplified instruments would now become part of the mix.

===''Highway 61 Revisited'' and ''Blonde on Blonde''===
In July 1965, Dylan released the single "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]", which peaked at #2 in the U.S. and at #4 in the UK charts.  At over six minutes in length, this song has been widely credited with altering attitudes about what a pop single could convey. [[Bruce Springsteen]] said that on first hearing this single, <U+201C>that snare shot sounded like somebody<U+2019>d kicked open the door to your mind<U+2026> I knew that I was listening to the toughest voice that I had ever heard.<U+201C><ref>Springsteen<U+2019>s speech on Dylan<U+2019>s induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], [[January 20]], [[1988]]. Quoted in ''Wanted Man'', edited John Bauldie, p.191</ref>  In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine listed it at number one on its list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref> Its signature sound <U+2014> with a full, jangling band and an organ riff <U+2014> also characterized his next album, ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]],'' titled after the road that led from Dylan's native Minnesota to the musical hotbed of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. The songs passed stylistically through the birthplace of blues, the [[Mississippi Delta]], and referenced a number of [[blues]] songs, including [[Fred McDowell|Mississippi Fred McDowell's]] "61 Highway". The songs were in the same vein as the hit single, with surreal litanies of the grotesque flavored by [[Mike Bloomfield]]'s blues guitar, a rhythm section, and Dylan's obvious enjoyment of the sessions. The closing song, "[[Desolation Row]]", is an apocalyptic vision with references to many figures of [[Western culture]].
[[Image:Music blonde on blonde.jpg|thumb|150px|A mix of [[folk music]], [[rock and roll]] and Dylan's own brand of surrealism, ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'' (1966)<ref>Gill, ''My Back Pages'', 93<U+2013>95</ref> is often considered one of the finest recordings of American popular music.]] 

In support of the record, Dylan was booked for two U.S. concerts and set about assembling a band. [[Mike Bloomfield]] was unwilling to leave the Butterfield Band, so Dylan mixed [[Al Kooper]] and [[Harvey Brooks]] from his studio crew with bar-band stalwarts [[Robbie Robertson]] and [[Levon Helm]], best known at the time for backing [[Ronnie Hawkins]]. In August 1965 at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium, the group was heckled by an audience who, Newport notwithstanding, still demanded the acoustic troubadour of previous years.  The band's reception on [[September 3]] at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] was more uniformly favorable.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 189<U+2013>90</ref> 

Neither Kooper nor Brooks wanted to tour with Dylan, and he was unable to lure his preferred band, a crew of west coast musicians best known for backing [[Johnny Rivers]], featuring guitarist [[James Burton]] and drummer [[Mickey Jones]], away from their regular commitments. So Dylan then hired Robertson and Helm's full band, [[The Band|The Hawks]], as his tour group, and began a string of studio sessions with them in an effort to record the follow-up to ''Highway 61 Revisited''.

While Dylan and the Hawks met increasingly receptive audiences on tour, their studio efforts floundered. Producer [[Bob Johnston]] had been trying to persuade Dylan to record in Nashville for some time. In February 1966 Dylan agreed and Johnston surrounded him with a cadre of top-notch session men. At Dylan's insistence, Robertson and Kooper came down from [[New York City]] to play on the sessions.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 238<U+2013>243</ref> The Nashville sessions produced the album ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'' (1966), featuring what Dylan later called "that thin wild mercury sound." [[Al Kooper]] said the record was a masterpiece because it was "taking two cultures and smashing them together with a huge explosion": the musical world of Nashville and the world of the "quintessential New York hipster" Bob Dylan.<ref>Gill, ''My Back Pages'', 95</ref>

For many critics, Dylan's mid-'60s trilogy of albums <U+2014> ''Bringing It All Back Home'', ''Highway 61 Revisited'' and ''Blonde on Blonde'' <U+2014> represents one of the great cultural achievements of the 20th century. In Mike Marqusee's words: "Between late 1964 and  the summer of 1966, Dylan created a body of work that remains unique. Drawing on folk, blues, country, R&B, rock'n'roll, gospel, British beat, symbolist, modernist and [[Beat poetry]], [[surrealism]] and [[Dada]], advertising jargon and social commentary, [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]] and [[Mad magazine]], he forged a coherent and original artistic voice and vision. The beauty of these albums retains the power to shock and console."<ref>Marqusee, ''Wicked Messenger'', 139</ref>

On November 22, 1965, Bob Dylan married Sara Lownds. Some of Dylan<U+2019>s friends (including [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]]) claim that, in conversation immediately after the event, Dylan denied that he was married.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p.393</ref>  Journalist [[Nora Ephron]] first made the news public in the [[New York Post]] in February 1966 with the headline <U+201C>Hush! Bob Dylan is wed.<U+201D><ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', p.325</ref>

Dylan undertook a "world tour" of [[Australia]] and Europe in the spring of 1966. Each show was split into two parts.  Dylan performed solo during the first half, accompanying himself on [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] and [[harmonica]].  In the second half, backed by [[the Hawks]], he played high voltage electric music. This contrast provoked many fans, who jeered and slowly handclapped. 

The tour culminated in a famously raucous confrontation between Dylan and his audience at the Manchester [[Free Trade Hall]] in [[England]] (officially released on CD in 1998 as ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The "Royal Albert Hall" Concert]]''). At the climax of the concert, [[John Cordwell|one fan]], angry with Dylan's electric sound, shouted: "[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]!" and Dylan responded, "I don't believe you... You're a liar!"  He turned to the band and, just within earshot of the microphone, said "Play it fucking loud!"<ref>Dylan's dialogue with the Manchester audience is recorded (with subtitles) in Scorsese's documentary [[No Direction Home]].</ref>  They then launched into the last song of the night with gusto <U+2014> "Like a Rolling Stone."

===After the crash: the Woodstock years and reclusion===

After his European tour, Dylan returned to [[New York]], but the pressures on him continued to increase.  [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television]] had paid an advance for a TV show they could screen.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p.215</ref> His publisher, [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], was demanding a finished manuscript of the poem/novel ''[[Tarantula (book)|Tarantula]].''  Manager [[Albert Grossman]] had already scheduled an extensive concert tour for that summer and fall.  On [[July 29]], [[1966]], while Dylan rode his [[Triumph Motorcycles|Triumph]] 500 [[motorcycle]] in [[Woodstock, New York]], its brakes locked, throwing him to the ground.  Though the extent of his injuries was never fully disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p.219</ref>  In commenting on the significance of the crash, Dylan made it plain that he had felt exploited at that time: <U+201C>When I had that motorcycle accident ... I woke up and caught my senses, I realized that I was just workin' for all these leeches. And I didn't want to do that.  Plus, I had a family and I just wanted to see my kids. "<ref>Cott (ed.), ''Dylan on Dylan: The Essential Interviews'', p.300, reprinted from Rolling Stone, June 21, 1984.</ref>

A sense of mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident and the seriousness of Dylan's injuries.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>  [[Howard Sounes]]'s biography, ''Down the Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'',  points out that no ambulance was called to the scene of the accident, and that Dylan was not taken to a hospital.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p.218</ref>  Sounes concludes that the crash offered Dylan the much-needed chance to escape from the pressures that had built up around him, and that it initiated a period of withdrawal from the public gaze lasting for 18 months.

Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began editing film footage of his 1966 tour for ''[[Eat the Document]]'', a rarely exhibited follow-up to ''[[Dont Look Back]]''.  A rough-cut was shown to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television]] and was promptly rejected as incomprehensible to a mainstream audience.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p.216</ref>  In 1967 he began recording music with the Hawks at his home and in the basement of the Hawks' nearby house, called "Big Pink". The relaxed atmosphere yielded renditions of many of Dylan's favored old and new songs and some newly written pieces.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 222<U+2013>5</ref> These songs, initially compiled as demos for other artists to record, provided hit singles for [[Julie Driscoll]] ("[[This Wheel's on Fire (song)|This Wheel's on Fire]]"), [[The Byrds]] ("You Ain't Goin' Nowhere", "Nothing Was Delivered"), and [[Manfred Mann]] ("[[Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)]]").  Columbia belatedly released selections from them in 1975 as ''[[The Basement Tapes]]''.  Over the years, more and more of the songs recorded by Dylan and his band in 1967 appeared on various [[bootleg recording]]s, culminating in a five-CD bootleg set titled ''The Genuine Basement Tapes'', containing 107 songs and alternate takes.<ref> Marcus, ''The Old, Weird America'', 236-265</ref>  Later in 1967, the Hawks re-named themselves [[The Band]], and independently recorded the album ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'', thus beginning a long and successful recording and performing career of their own.

In 1997, the critic [[Greil Marcus]] published an influential study of [[The Basement Tapes]], entitled [[Invisible Republic]]. Marcus quoted [[Robbie Robertson]]<U+2019>s memories of recording the songs: <U+201C>(Dylan) would pull these songs out of nowhere. We didn<U+2019>t know if he wrote them or if he remembered them. When he sang them, you couldn<U+2019>t tell.<U+201D><ref> Marcus, ''The Old, Weird America'', xvi</ref>  Marcus called these songs <U+201C>palavers with a community of ghosts<U+201D><ref> Marcus, ''The Old, Weird America'', 86</ref>  He suggests that <U+201C>these ghosts were not abstractions. As native sons and daughters they were a community. And they were once gathered in a single place: on the [[Anthology of American Folk Music]], a work produced by a twenty-nine year old of no fixed address named [[Harry Everett Smith|Harry Smith]].<U+201D><ref> Marcus, ''The Old, Weird America'', 87</ref>   Marcus argued Dylan<U+2019>s basement songs were a resurrection of the spirit of Smith<U+2019>s Anthology, originally published by [[Folkways Records]] in 1952, a collection of blues and country songs recorded in the 1920s and 1930s, which proved very influential in the folk music revival of the 1950s and the 1960s. (The book was re-published in 2001 under the title ''The Old, Weird America''.) 

In October and November 1967, Dylan returned to [[Nashville]]. Back in the recording studio after a 19 months break, he was accompanied only by [[Charlie McCoy]] on bass, [[Kenny Buttrey]] on drums, and [[Pete Drake]] on steel guitar.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>  At the end of the year, Dylan released ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]'', his first album since the motorcycle crash. It was a quiet, contemplative record of shorter songs, set in a landscape that drew on both the [[American West]] and the [[Bible]]. The sparse structure and instrumentation, coupled with lyrics that took the Judeo-Christian tradition seriously, marked a departure not only from Dylan's own work but from the escalating psychedelic fervor of the 1960s musical culture.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 282<U+2013>288</ref> It included "[[All Along the Watchtower]]", with lyrics derived from the [[Book of Isaiah]] (21:5<U+2013>9). The song was later recorded by [[Jimi Hendrix]], whose celebrated version Dylan himself acknowledged as definitive in the liner notes to ''[[Biograph (album)|Biograph]]''. As proof, since 1974 Dylan and his bands have performed arrangements much closer to Hendrix's than to the ''John Wesley Harding'' version.<ref>[[Biograph (album)]], 1985,  Liner notes & text by [[Cameron Crowe]].</ref>

[[Woody Guthrie]] died on [[October 3]], [[1967]], and Dylan made his first live appearance in twenty months at a Guthrie memorial concert held at [[Carnegie Hall]] on [[January 20]], [[1968]].

Dylan's next release, ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' (1969), was virtually a mainstream country record featuring instrumental backing by [[Nashville]] musicians, a mellow-voiced, contented Dylan, a duet with [[Johnny Cash]], and the hit single "[[Lay Lady Lay]]", which had been originally written for the ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' [[soundtrack]], but was not submitted in time to make the final cut.  <ref>Trager, Oliver. ''Keys to the Rain, the Definitive Bob Dylan Encyclopedia.'' Billboard Books, 2004. (ISBN 0-8230-7974-0)</ref>. It was during these sessions that Dylan met [[Carl Perkins]], and co-wrote the song "[[Champaign, Illinois]]" with him, which would appear on Perkin's album "On Top" released the following year. <ref> {{cite web | url= http://www.rockabillyhall.com/CarlPerkins.html | title=RAB Hall of Fame: Carl Perkins | accessdate= 2007-01-18 | publisher= Rockabilly Hall of Fame}} </ref> <ref> {{cite web | url= http://music.aol.com/album/on-top/12282 | title= On Top - Carl Perkins | accessdate= 2007-01-18 | publisher= AOL Music}} </ref> In May 1969, Dylan appeared on the first episode of [[Johnny Cash]]'s new television show, duetting with Cash on "[[Girl from the North Country]]", "[[It Ain't Me Babe]]" and "Living the Blues". Dylan next traveled to England to top the bill at the [[Isle of Wight]] rock festival on [[August 31]], [[1969]], after rejecting overtures to appear at the [[Woodstock Festival]] far closer to his home.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 248<U+2013>253</ref></b>

In the early 1970s critics charged Dylan's output was of varied and unpredictable quality. ''Rolling Stone'' magazine writer and Dylan loyalist [[Greil Marcus]] notoriously asked "What is this shit?" upon first listening to 1970's ''[[Self Portrait]]''. In general, ''Self Portrait'', a double LP including few original songs, was poorly received. Later that year, Dylan released ''[[New Morning]]'', which some considered a return to form. In the same year Dylan co-wrote "I'd Have You Anytime" with [[George Harrison]], which appeared as the opening track on the ex-Beatle's album [[All Things Must Pass]] (which also included a cover of Dylan's "If Not For You"). His unannounced appearance at [[George Harrison|Harrison's]] 1971 ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh|Concert for Bangladesh]]'' was widely praised, particularly a snarling version of "A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall". However, reports of a new album, a television special, and a return to touring came to nothing. Dylan's only other studio activity in 1970 consisted of two songs ("East Virginia Blues" and "Nashville Skyline Rag") recorded in December with banjo-player [[Earl Scruggs]] and his sons [[Randy Scruggs|Randy]] and Gary, which would eventually appear on Scruggs' 1971 album ''Earl Scruggs Performing With His Family And Friends''<ref> {{cite web | url= http://www.bobdylanroots.com/scruggs.html | title= Earl Scruggs (and Lester Flatt) | publisher= bobdylanroots.com}}</ref>.

Between March 16th and 19th, 1971, Dylan reserved three days at Blue Rock Studios, a small studio in New York's [[Greenwich Village]]. The sessions resulted in three singles ("''Watching The River Flow''", "''When I Paint My Masterpiece''" and "''George Jackson''"), but no album. The only long-player released by Dylan in either '71 or '72  was his second greatest hits compilation, "''[[Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II]]''", which included a number of re-workings of as-then unreleased [[Basement Tapes]] tracks, such as "''I Shall Be Released''" and "''You Ain't Goin' Nowhere''" with [[Happy Traum]] on backup. In November of 1971 Dylan recorded a series of as-yet-unreleased sessions with [[Beat generation|Beat]] poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] at the [[Record Plant]] in [[New York]], intended for Ginsberg's "Holy Soul Jelly Roll" album. The sessions resulted in tracks such as the Dylan/Ginsberg compositions "Vomit Express", "September On Jessore Road" and "Jimmy Berman", as well as a number of Ginsberg originals and [[William Blake]] poems set to music. Ginsberg sang lead on most songs, with Dylan playing guitar and harmonica and providing backing vocals

In 1972 Dylan signed onto [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s film ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]'', providing the songs (see [[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (album)]]) and taking a role as "Alias", a minor member of Billy's gang. Despite the film's failure at the box office, the song "[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door (song)|Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]" has proven its durability, having been covered by over 150 recording artists.<ref>{{cite news |  title = Bob Dylan cover versions | publisher = Bjorner.com | date = 2002-04-16 | url = http://www.bjorner.com/Covers.htm | accessdate = 2006-09-01 }}</ref>

==="On the Road Again"===
[[Image:Ginsberg-dylan2.jpg|right|thumb|Portrait of [[Allen Ginsberg]] and Bob Dylan by Elsa Dorfman, 1975.]]
Dylan started 1973 by contributing his own composition, "[[Wallflower (Bob Dylan song)|Wallflower]]", to [[Doug Sahm]]'s ''"Doug Sahm and Band"'' album released on [[Atlantic Records]], as well as sharing lead vocal and playing guitar on the track. (Dylan's own version of the song would later be released on [[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3]].) Dylan also signed with [[David Geffen]]'s new [[Asylum Records|Asylum]] label when his contract with [[Columbia Records]] expired in 1973, and he recorded ''[[Planet Waves]]'' with [[The Band]] while rehearsing for a major tour.  The album included two versions of "Forever Young". [[Christopher Ricks]] has connected the chorus of this song with [[John Keats]]'s [[Ode on a Grecian Urn]]<ref>Ricks, ''Dylan's Visions of Sin'', 453</ref>, ("For ever panting, and for ever young"), and Dylan has recalled writing the song for one of his own children: <U+201C>I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental<U+201D>.<ref>Dylan's comment in booklet notes to ''[[Biograph (album)|Biograph]]''.</ref>  It has remained one of the most frequently performed of his songs<ref>{{cite web | title = Log of performances of Forever Young | publisher = Bjorner's Still on the Road | date = [[August 20]], [[2006]] | url = http://www.bjorner.com/sixf.htm#_Toc481033921 | accessdate = 2006-08-22 }}</ref>, and one critic described it as <U+201C>something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan.<U+201D><ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 354.</ref>  Columbia Records simultaneously released ''[[Dylan (1973 album)|Dylan]]'', a haphazard collection of studio outtakes (almost exclusively cover songs), which was widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan's signing with a rival record label.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 358 </ref>  In January 1974 Dylan and [[The Band]] embarked on their high-profile, coast-to-coast [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour]] of North America; promoter [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] claimed he received more ticket purchase requests than for any prior tour by any artist. A live double album of the tour, ''[[Before the Flood]]'' which included Dylan with [[The Band]], was released on [[Asylum Records]]. Later in the mid 70s ''[[Before the Flood]]'' was released by Columbia records.

After the tour, Dylan and his wife became publicly estranged. He filled a small red notebook with songs about his marital problems, and quickly recorded a new album entitled ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'' in September 1974.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 368<U+2013>383</ref> Word of Dylan's efforts soon leaked out, and expectations were high. But Dylan delayed the album's release, and then, by years end he had re-recorded half of the songs at [[Sound 80]] Studios in [[Minneapolis]] with production assistance from his brother [[David Zimmerman (producer)|David Zimmerman]].  During this time, Dylan returned to Columbia Records which eventually reissued his Asylum albums.

Released in early 1975, ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'' received mixed reviews. In the ''[[NME]]'', [[Nick Kent]] described "the accompaniments [as] often so trashy they sound like mere practise takes." In ''Rolling Stone'', reviewer [[Jon Landau]] wrote that "the record has been made with typical shoddiness". However, over the years critics have come to see it as one of Dylan's greatest achievements, perhaps the only serious rival to his great mid 60s trilogy of albums. In [[Salon.com]], Bill Wyman wrote: "''Blood on the Tracks'' is his only flawless album and his best produced; the songs, each of them, are constructed in disciplined fashion.  It is his kindest album and most dismayed, and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrhea-plagued excesses of his mid-'60s output and the self-consciously simple compositions of his post-accident years."<ref>{{cite news | title = But one track on ''Blood on the Tracks '', [[Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts]] was almost made a feature film, one, was directed by a major film corporation, and another, directed by Dylan himself. | title = Bob Dylan | publisher = Salon.com | date = [[May 5]], [[2001]] | url = http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2001/05/22/dylan/index3.html | accessdate = 2006-08-21 }}</ref> The songs have been described as Dylan's most intimate and direct.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 368<U+2013>387</ref><ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 59<U+2013>61</ref> A year later, Dylan recorded a duet of the song "Buckets of Rain" with [[Bette Midler]] on her [[Songs for the New Depression]] album.[http://www.searchingforagem.com/Misc/Duets.htm] When Dylan was initially approached to do a duet with Midler, he wanted to record a version of "Friends." While they rehearsed this song, it was the "Blood on the Tracks" closer which was eventually released.[http://www.betteontheboards.com/boards/album-03.htm]

That summer Dylan wrote his first successful "protest" song in twelve years, championing the cause of boxer [[Rubin Carter|Rubin "Hurricane" Carter]] whom he believed had been wrongfully imprisoned for a triple murder in [[Paterson, New Jersey]]. After visiting Carter in jail, Dylan wrote "[[Hurricane (song)|Hurricane]]", presenting the case for Carter's innocence. Despite its 8:32 minute length, the song was released as a single, peaking at #33 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard Chart]], and performed at every 1975 date of Dylan's next tour, the [[Rolling Thunder Revue]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Log of every performance of Hurricane | publisher = Bjorner's Still on the Road | date = [[August 20]], [[2006]] | url = http://www.bjorner.com/sixh.htm#_Toc481036436 | accessdate = 2006-08-22 }}</ref> The tour was a varied evening of entertainment featuring many performers drawn mostly from the resurgent Greenwich Village folk scene, including [[T-Bone Burnett]]; [[Allen Ginsberg]]; [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]]; [[Steven Soles]]; [[David Mansfield]]; former [[The Byrds|Byrds]] frontman [[Roger McGuinn]]; British guitarist [[Mick Ronson]]; [[Scarlet Rivera]], a [[violin]] player Dylan discovered while she was walking down the street to a rehearsal, her violin case hanging on her back;<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 579</ref>  and [[Joan Baez]] (the tour marked Baez and Dylan's first joint performance in more than a decade). [[Joni Mitchell]] added herself to the Revue in November, and poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] accompanied the troupe, staging scenes for the film Dylan was simultaneously shooting. [[Sam Shepard]] was initially hired as the writer for this film, but ended up accompanying the tour as informal chronicler.<ref>Shepard, ''Rolling Thunder Logbook'', 2<U+2013>49</ref> 

Running through late 1975 and again through early 1976, the tour encompassed the release of the album ''[[Desire (album)|Desire]]'' (1976), with many of Dylan's new songs featuring an almost [[travel literature|travelogue]]-like narrative style, showing the influence of his new collaborator, playwright [[Jacques Levy]].<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 386<U+2013>401</ref><ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 408</ref>  The spring 1976 half of the tour was documented by a TV concert special, ''Hard Rain'', and the LP ''[[Hard Rain (album)|Hard Rain]]''; no concert album from the better-received and better-known opening half of the tour was released until 2002, when ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue|Live 1975]]'' appeared as the fifth volume in Dylan's official ''Bootleg Series''. The single "Rita May", an outtake from the ''Desire'' sessions, backed with the ''Hard Rain'' version of "Stuck Inside Of Mobile With The Memphis Blues Again" was also released in promotion of both releases <ref> {{cite web | url= http://www.searchingforagem.com/Misc/MrD2004.htm | title= Mr D's Apocrypha | accessdate= 2007-01-19 | publisher= Flying Pig}} </ref>. 

The fall 1975 tour with the Revue also provided the backdrop to Dylan's nearly four-hour film ''[[Renaldo and Clara]]'', a sprawling and improvised narrative mixed with concert footage and reminiscences. Released in 1978, the movie received generally poor, sometimes scathing, reviews<ref>{{cite news | last=Maslin | first = Janet | title = Renaldo and Clara Film by Bob Dylan | publisher = The New York Times | date =[[January 22]], [[1978]] | url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nytimes/120958866.html?did=120958866&FMT=ABS&FMTS=AI&date=Jan+26%2C+1978&author=By+JANET+MASLIN&pub=New+York+Times++(1857-Current+file)&desc=%27Renaldo+and+Clara%2C%27+Film+by+Bob+Dylan | accessdate = 2006-08-05}}</ref><ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 313</ref>  and had a very brief theatrical run. Later in that year, Dylan allowed a two-hour edit, dominated by the concert performances, to be more widely released.

In November 1976 Dylan appeared at The Band's "farewell" concert, along with other guests including [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Muddy Waters]],  [[Van Morrison]] and [[Neil Young]].  [[Martin Scorsese]]'s acclaimed<ref>{{cite web | title = ''Last Waltz, The (re-release)'' | publisher = MetaCritic.com | url = http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/lastwaltz?q=the%20last%20waltz | accessdate = 2006-08-04 }}</ref> cinematic chronicle of this show, ''[[The Last Waltz]],'' was released in 1978 and included about half of Dylan's set. In this year Dylan also wrote and duetted on the song "Sign Language" for [[Eric Clapton]]'s ''"[[No Reason To Cry]]"'' album - no other versions of the song apart from the one which appears on this album have ever been released. In 1977 he also contributed backing vocals to [[Leonard Cohen]]'s [[Phil Spector]]-produced album ''"[[Death of a Ladies' Man]]"''.

Dylan's 1978 album ''[[Street Legal (album)|Street Legal]]'' was lyrically one of his more complex and cohesive;<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 643</ref>  it suffered, however, from a poor sound mix (attributed to his studio recording practices),<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 480<U+2013>1</ref>  submerging much of its instrumentation in the sonic equivalent of cotton wadding until its remastered CD release nearly a quarter century later.

''[[Slow Train Coming]]'' (1979) is generally regarded as the more accomplished of these albums, winning him the [[Grammy Award]] as "Best Male Vocalist" for the song "[[Gotta Serve Somebody]]". The second evangelical album, ''[[Saved (album)|Saved]]'' (1980), received mixed reviews, although [[Kurt Loder]] in [[Rolling Stone]] declared the album was far superior, musically, to its predecessor.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bobdylan/albums/album/175580/review/5944002/saved| title = Bob Dylan's ''Saved'' | publisher = [[Rolling Stone]] | date = [[1980-09-18]]}}</ref> When touring from the fall of 1979 through the spring of 1980, Dylan would not play any of his older, secular works, and he delivered declarations of his faith from the stage, such as:

Robert Hilburn interviewed Dylan about the new direction in his music for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.

''Rolling Stone'' editor [[Jann Wenner]], writing in his review for ''[[Slow Train Coming]]'', commented:
{{blockquote|''Slow Train Coming'' is pure, true Dylan, probably the purest and truest Dylan ever. The religious symbolism is a logical progression of Dylan's [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] vision of life and his pain-filled struggle with good and evil... since politics, economics and war have failed to make us feel any better <U+2013> as individuals or as a nation <U+2013> and we look back at long years of disrepair, then maybe the time for religion has come again, and rather too suddenly <U+2013> "like a thief in the night."<ref>{{cite news | title = Slow Train Coming | publisher = Rolling Stone | date = [[1979-09-20]] | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bobdylan/albums/album/241841/review/6067720/slow_train_coming | accessdate = 2006-09-11}}</ref>}}

Since the early 1980s Dylan's personal religious beliefs have been the subject of debate<ref>{{cite web | first = Arthur | last = Kawowski | title = Bob Dylan's Dilemma: Which blonde | date = [[2001-09-01]] | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-79354004.html | accessdate = 2007-06-21}}</ref> among fans and critics. He has seemingly supported the [[Chabad Lubavitch]] movement<ref>Fishkoff, ''The Rebbe's Army: Inside the World of Chabad-Lubavitch'', 167</ref> and participated in many Jewish rituals. More recently, it has been reported that Dylan has "shown up" a few times at various High Holiday services at various Chabad synagogues. He attended a Woodbury, New York synagogue in 2005,<ref>{{cite news | first=News Service | last=Shmais | title = Bob Dylan @ Yom Kippur davening with Chabad in Long Island | publisher = Shmais News Service | date = [[2005-10-13]] | url = http://www.shmais.com/pages.cfm?page=archivenewsdetail&ID=24447}}</ref> and attended Congregation Beth Tefillah, in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] on [[September 22]], [[2007]] ([[Yom Kippur]]), where he was called to the [[Torah]] for the sixth [[aliyah]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Arutz| last=Sheva | title = Day of Atonement Draws Dylan to the Torah | publisher = Arutz Sheva -- Israel National News | date = [[2007-09-24]] | url = http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/133709}}</ref>

In 1997 he told [[David Gates (author)|David Gates]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'':
{{blockquote|Here's the thing with me and the religious thing. This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don't find it anywhere else.

I believe the songs."<ref>''Newsweek'' magazine, [[October 6]], [[1997]]</ref>}}

In an interview published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on [[September 28]], [[1997]], journalist [[Jon Pareles]] reported that "Dylan says he now subscribes to no organized religion."<ref>{{cite news | first=Jon | last= Pareles | url = http://www.interferenza.net/bcs/interw/97-set27.htm| title = A Wiser Voice Blowin' In the Autumn Wind

===1980s: Trust Yourself===
In the fall of 1980 Dylan briefly resumed touring, restoring several of his most popular 1960s songs to his repertoire, for a series of concerts billed as "A Musical Retrospective". ''[[Shot of Love]]'', recorded the next spring, featured Dylan's first secular compositions in more than two years, mixed with explicitly Christian songs. The haunting "[[Every Grain of Sand (Bob Dylan song)|Every Grain of Sand]]" reminded some critics of [[William Blake]]<U+2019>s verses.<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 215<U+2013>221</ref>  

In the 1980s the quality of Dylan's recorded work varied, from the well-regarded ''[[Infidels]]'' in 1983 to the panned ''[[Down in the Groove]]'' in 1988.  Critics such as [[Michael Gray (author)|Michael Gray]] condemned Dylan's 1980s albums both for showing an extraordinary carelessness in the studio and for failing to release his best songs.<ref>Gray, ''Song & Dance Man III: The Art of Bob Dylan'', 11<U+2013>14</ref>

The ''Infidels'' recording sessions produced several notable outtakes, and many have questioned Dylan's judgment in leaving them off the album. Most well-regarded of these were "[[Blind Willie McTell (song)|Blind Willie McTell]]" (which was both a tribute to the dead blues singer and an extraordinary evocation of African American history reaching back to "the ghosts of slavery ships"<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 56<U+2013>59</ref>), "Foot of Pride" and "Lord Protect My Child";<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 354<U+2013>6</ref> these songs were later released on the boxed set ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961-1991]]''. An earlier version of ''Infidels'', prepared by producer/guitarist [[Mark Knopfler]], contained different arrangements and song selections than what appeared on the final product.

Dylan contributed vocals to [[USA for Africa]]'s [[famine relief]] fundraising single "[[We Are the World]]". On [[13 July]] [[1985]], he appeared at the climax of the [[Live Aid]] concert at [[JFK Stadium]], [[Philadelphia]]. Backed by [[Keith Richards]] and [[Ron Wood]], Dylan performed a ragged version of "Hollis Brown", his ballad of rural poverty, and then said to a worldwide audience exceeding one billion people: "I hope that some of the money ... maybe they can just take a little bit of it, maybe ... one or two million, maybe ... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks." His remarks were widely criticised as inappropriate, but they did inspire [[Willie Nelson]] to organise a series of events, [[Farm Aid]], to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 365<U+2013>7</ref> 

In [[1986 in music|1986]] Dylan made a foray into the world of [[rap music]], appearing on [[Kurtis Blow]]'s ''Kingdom Blow'' album. In an arrangement set up, in part, by [[Debra Byrd]] (one of Dylan's back-up singers) and Wayne K. Garfield (an associate of Blow's), Dylan contributed vocals to the track "Street Rock."<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 63</ref>  In his memoir, ''[[Chronicles, Vol. 1|Chronicles]]'', Dylan writes, "Blow familiarized me with that stuff, [[Ice-T]], [[Public Enemy]], [[N.W.A.]], [[Run-D.M.C.]].  These guys definitely weren't standing around bullshitting.  They were all poets and knew what was going on."<ref>Dylan, ''Chronicles, Vol. 1'', 219</ref>  Dylan's opening rap for "Street Rock" goes, "I've indulged in higher knowledge through scan of encyclopedia / keep in constant research of our report and news media / kids starve in Ethiopia and we are getting greedier / the rich are getting richer and the needy's getting needier."

In July 1986 Dylan released ''[[Knocked Out Loaded]]'', an album which consisted of three cover songs (by Little [[Junior Parker]], [[Kris Kristofferson]] and the traditional gospel hymn "[[Precious Memories]]"), three collaborations with other songwriters ([[Tom Petty]], [[Sam Shepard]] and [[Carole Bayer Sager]]), and two solo compositions by Dylan himself. The album received mainly negative reviews; [[Rolling Stone]] called it "a depressing affair"<ref>{{cite web

In 1986 and 1987, Dylan toured extensively with [[Tom Petty]] and The Heartbreakers, sharing vocals with Petty on several songs each night. The tour was filmed for the documentary ''Hard to Handle''<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>  After performing with these different musical permutations, Dylan initiated what came to be called The [[Never Ending Tour]] on June 7, 1988, performing with a tight back-up band featuring guitarist [[G. E. Smith]].  Dylan would keep on touring with this small but constantly evolving band for the next 19 years. 

In 1987 Dylan starred in [[Richard Marquand]]'s movie ''[[Hearts of Fire]]'', in which he played a washed-up-rock-star-turned-chicken farmer called "Billy Parker", whose teenage lover ([[Fiona (singer)|Fiona]]) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation ([[Rupert Everett]]). Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack - "''Night After Night''", and '''I Had a Dream About You, Baby''" - as well as a cover of [[John Hiatt]]'s "''The Usual''". The film was a critical and commercial flop.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 599<U+2013>604</ref> 

Dylan was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in January 1988. [[Bruce Springsteen]] made the induction speech, declaring: "Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual."<ref>{{cite web

Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990, which they released with the unexpected title [[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3]]. 

Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with the [[Daniel Lanois]]-produced ''[[Oh Mercy]]'' (1989).<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 387<U+2013>8</ref> Lanois's influence is audible throughout ''Oh Mercy''.<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 515</ref><ref>Dylan, ''Chronicles, Vol. 1'', 145<U+2013>221</ref> The track "Most of the Time", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film ''[[High Fidelity (film)|High Fidelity]]'', while "What Was It You Wanted?" has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans.<ref>Ricks, ''Dylan's Visions of Sin'', 413<U+2013>20</ref>  The dense religious imagery of 'Ring Them Bells' struck some critics as a re-affirmation of faith.  Scott Marshall wrote: "When Dylan sings that 'The sun is going down upon the sacred cow', it's safe to assume that the sacred cow here is the biblical metaphor for all false gods.  For Dylan, the world will eventually know that there is only one God."<ref>Marshall, ''Restless Pilgrim'', 103</ref>  Dylan also made a number of music videos during this period, but only "Political World" found any regular airtime on [[MTV]].

===1990s: Not Dark Yet===
[[Image:B dylan 1996.jpg|thumb|Dylan performs at a 1996 concert in Stockholm.]]
Dylan's 1990s began with ''[[Under the Red Sky]]'' (1990), an about-face from the serious ''Oh Mercy''. The album was dedicated to "Gabby Goo Goo", and contained several apparently simple songs, including "Under the Red Sky" and "Wiggle Wiggle". The "Gabby Goo Goo" dedication was later explained as a nickname for Dylan's four-year-old daughter.<ref>{{cite news

Despite the stellar line-up, the record received bad reviews and sold poorly.  Dylan would not make another studio album of new songs for seven years.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 391</ref>  

In 1991 Bob Dylan was inducted into the [[Minnesota Music Hall of Fame]] and in 1992 Dylan performed a brief tour with [[Santana (band)|Santana]].<ref>.[http://www.mnmusichalloffame.org/inductees.html]</ref>

The next few years saw Dylan returning to his roots with two albums covering old folk and blues numbers: ''[[Good as I Been to You]]'' (1992) and ''[[World Gone Wrong]]'' (1993), featuring interpretations and acoustic guitar work. Many critics and fans commented on the quiet beauty of the song "Lone Pilgrim",<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 423</ref> penned by a 19th century teacher and sung by Dylan with a haunting reverence. An exception to this rootsy mood came in Dylan's 1991 songwriting collaboration with [[Michael Bolton]]; the resulting song "Steel Bars", was released on Bolton's album ''[[Time, Love & Tenderness]]''.  Twenty-five years after famously failing to perform at the [[Woodstock Festival]], Dylan appeared at the commemorative event entitled [[Woodstock 94]].<ref>{{cite web

With its bitter assessment of love and morbid ruminations, Dylan's first collection of original songs in seven years became highly acclaimed.  It also achieved an unforeseen popularity among young listeners, particularly the opening song, "Love Sick".<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 426<U+2013>9</ref>  This collection of complex songs won him his first solo "Album of the Year" [[Grammy Award]] (he was one of numerous performers on ''[[Concert for Bangladesh|The Concert for Bangladesh]]'', the 1972 winner). The love song "[[Make You Feel My Love]]" was covered by both [[Garth Brooks]] and [[Billy Joel]]. 

In December 1997 U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] presented Dylan with a Kennedy Center Honor in the East Room of the [[White House]], paying this tribute: "He probably had more impact on people of my generation than any other creative artist. His voice and lyrics haven't always been easy on the ear, but throughout his career Bob Dylan has never aimed to please. He's disturbed the peace and discomforted the powerful."<ref>{{cite news

[http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1002403/a/Clinch+Mountain+Country.htm].Between June and September, 1999, Dylan toured with [[Paul Simon]].  They performed a couple of songs together at each show, including "[[I Walk the Line]]" and "[[Blue Moon Of Kentucky]]".  ([[Simon & Garfunkel]] had recorded "[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]" on their debut album, ''Wednesday Morning, 3AM'', and Dylan had covered [[The Boxer]] on his [[Self Portrait]] album.) Dylan ended the nineties by returning to the big screen after a break of ten years in the role of Alfred the Chaffeur alongside [[Ben Gazzara]] and [[Karen Black]] in Robert Clapsaddle's ''Paradise Cove''.<ref>{{cite web

Between "''Love and Theft''" and Dylan's next studio album (to be released five years later) he recorded songs - both originals and covers - for a number of different projects.  "''I Can't Get You Off of My Mind''", Dylan's contribution to the [[Hank Williams]] tribute album "Timeless" was released in September 2001.  2002 saw the release of Dylan's version of "Train Of Love" on a similar [[Johnny Cash]] tribute album called "''[[Kindred Spirits: A Tribute to the Songs of Johnny Cash|Kindred Spirits]]''". (Dylan had recorded the song for a Johnny Cash TV tribute, broadcast in April 1999. In his spoken introduction, Dylan thanked Cash "for standing up for me way back when.")  In 2002 [[Solomon Burke]] recorded a version of the rare Dylan composition "Stepchild" for his ''[[Don't Give Up on Me]]'' album. While the song has never surfaced as a studio recording, there are a number of bootlegs in circulation of Dylan playing the track at soundchecks in the late 70's <ref> {{cite web | url= http://expectingrain.com/dok/olof94/olof9404.html | title= Bob Dylan live bootlegs | accessdate=2007-11-25 | last=Bj<U+00F6>rner | first= Olof | publisher= Expecting Rain}} </ref> . In February 2003, the 8-minute long epic ballad "Cross The Green Mountain", written and recorded by Dylan, was released as the closing song on the soundtrack to the Civil War movie ''[[Gods and Generals]]'', and later appeared as one of the 42 rare tracks on the iTunes Music Store release of ''Bob Dylan: The Collection''. A music video for the song was also produced in promotion of the motion picture.

2003 also saw the release of the film ''[[Masked & Anonymous]]'', a creative collaboration with television producer [[Larry Charles]], featuring many well-known actors. Dylan and Charles cowrote the film under the pseudonyms Rene Fontaine and Sergei Petrov.<ref>{{cite web

The song is an original composition, not a cover of the similarly titled traditional folk song. The melody is based on "I Never Loved But One" by the [[Carter Family]].

In February 2006, Dylan recorded tracks in New York City that were to result in the album ''[[Modern Times (Bob Dylan album)|Modern Times]]'', released on [[August 29]] [[2006]].

He's like a flame: If you try to hold him in your hand you'll surely get burned. Dylan's life of change and constant disappearances and constant transformations makes you yearn to hold him, and to nail him down. And that's why his fan base is so obsessive, so desirous of finding the truth and the absolutes and the answers to him - things that Dylan will never provide and will only frustrate....

Also released in October, the DVD [[The Other Side of the Mirror (film)|''The Other Side of the Mirror: Bob Dylan Live at the Newport Folk Festival 1963-1965'']] featured previously unseen footage, chronicling the changes in Dylan<U+2019>s style when he appeared at Newport in three successive years. This film was broadcast by [[BBC Four]] on October 14, 2007.  Director [[Murray Lerner]] commented: <U+201C>Over the course of three Newport gigs, Dylan becomes more conscious of his power. His charisma is startling. With electricity and radio, he did what [[William Butler Yeats|Yeats]], [[Lorca]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Ezra Pound]] never achieved.

[[Random House]] had published a book of Dylan's drawings and paintings, ''Drawn Blank'', in 1994.  German art gallery director Ingrid M<U+00F6>ssinger approached Dylan to suggest an exhibition of his work. The result was the October 2007 opening<ref>{{cite news

Dylan is currently curating a project to set some of [[Hank Williams]]'s "lost" lyrics to music, similar to the one undertaken by [[Billy Bragg]] and [[Wilco]] with [[Woody Guthrie]]'s unaccompanied lyrics on "[[Mermaid Avenue]]". Steppin' in It bassist Dominic Suchyta, who is involved in the project, has suggested that Dylan is overseeing contributions by [[Jack White]], [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Norah Jones]], who will put the lyrics to music.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/47167-jack-white-bob-dylan-rework-hank-williams-lyrics| title= Jack White, Bob Dylan Rework Hank Williams  Lyrics|accessdate=2007-11-19|Publisher= Pitchfork Media|}} </ref> The project started when Dylan acquired the lyrics that were in Wiliams's briefcase on the night he died.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/action/article/5856/news/music/bob_dylan_jack_white_others_finish| title= Dylan, Jack White, others finish Hank songs| accessdate=2007-11-19|Publisher=Paste Magazine|}} </ref>. Dylan has also recorded a new version of " A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall" exclusively for the water-themed Expo [[Zaragoza]] 2008 world fair, as well as having chosen local-band [[Amaral (music group)|Amaral]] to record a version of the song in Spanish.

====Recent live performances and the Never Ending Tour====

Some fans have complained that, as Dylan's vocal range has diminished, he has resorted to a technique they have labelled 'upsinging'. One critic described the technique as Dylan's "dismantling melodies by delivering phrases in a monotone and ending them an octave higher".<ref>{{cite news

For a two and a half year period, between 2003 and 2006, Dylan ceased playing guitar, and stuck to the keyboard during concerts.  Various rumors circulated as to why Dylan gave up guitar during this period, none very reliable. According to David Gates, a [[Newsweek]] reporter who interviewed Dylan in 2004, "...basically it has to do with his guitar not giving him quite the fullness of sound he was wanting at the bottom. (Six strings on a guitar, ten fingers on a piano.) He's thought of hiring a keyboard player so he doesn't have to do it himself, but hasn't been able to figure out who.  Most keyboard players, he says, like to be soloists, and he wants a very basic sound."<ref>{{cite news

In 2006, this was changed to an organ sound.  At the start of his Spring 2007 tour in Europe, Dylan played the first half of the set on electric guitar and switched to keyboard for the second half.<ref>{{cite news

==Personal life==
Dylan married [[Sara Dylan|Sara Lownds]] on [[November 22]], [[1965]]; their first child, Jesse Byron Dylan, was born on [[January 6]] [[1966]].  Dylan and Lownds had four children: [[Jesse Dylan|Jesse Byron]], Anna Lea, Samuel Isaac Abraham, and [[Jakob Dylan|Jakob Luke]] (born [[December 9]], [[1969]]). Dylan also adopted Sara Lownds' daughter from a prior marriage,  Maria Lownds (later Dylan), (born [[October 21]] [[1961]] now married to musician [[Peter Himmelman]]). In the 1990s the youngest of his children, [[Jakob Dylan]], became well known as the lead singer of the band [[The Wallflowers]]. [[Jesse Dylan]] is a film director and a successful businessman.  Bob and Sara Dylan were divorced on [[June 29]] [[1977]],<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 198<U+2013>200</ref>.  

In June 1986, Dylan married his longtime backup singer [[Carolyn Dennis]] (often professionally known as Carol Dennis).<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 372<U+2013>3</ref>  Their daughter, Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, was born on [[January 31]], [[1986]].

Their marriage and child remained a closely guarded secret until the publication of [[Howard Sounes]]' Dylan biography, ''Down the Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'' in 2001.<ref>{{cite news

Within minutes of the end of concerts, set lists and reviews are posted by his loyal following.<ref>Muir, ''Razor's Edge'', 22<U+2013>25</ref>

The Dylan Pool, created in 2001 has been featured on CNN, CBC, BBC, and the Associated Press. The Associated Press reported: "The pool reflects both the obsessive interest Dylan still draws 45 years into his career and the way this road warrior has structured his career."<ref name "Unpredictability" /> It allows interaction between fans while adding a level of competition through the unique online Bob Dylan fantasy game.
In the summer of 2007 the Dylan Pool went offline but some fans, having anticipated this eventuality, launched a new website: [http://www.theneverendingpool.com The neverending pool].

==''Chronicles: Volume One''==
After a lengthy delay, October 2004 saw the publishing of Dylan's autobiography ''[[Chronicles: Vol. One|Chronicles: Volume One]]'', with which he once again confounded expectations.<ref name="Maslin">{{cite web

}}</ref>  Dylan wrote three chapters about the year between his arrival in [[New York City]] in 1961 and recording his first album. Dylan focused on the brief period before he was a household name, while virtually ignoring the mid-1960s when his fame was at its height. Details about his motorcycle accident are limited to a few words in a single sentence. He also devoted chapters to two lesser-known albums, ''[[New Morning]]'' (1970) and ''[[Oh Mercy]]'' (1989), which contained insights into his collaborations with poet [[Archibald MacLeish]] and producer [[Daniel Lanois]]. In the ''[[New Morning]]'' chapter, Dylan expresses distaste for the "spokesman of a generation" label bestowed upon him, and evinces disgust with his more fanatical followers.

Another section features Dylan's account of a guitar-playing style in mathematical detail that he claimed was the key to his renaissance in the 1990s.<ref>Dylan, ''Chronicles, Vol. 1'', 156<U+2013>162</ref> Despite the [[Opaque context|opacity]] of some passages, there is an overall clarity in voice that is generally missing in Dylan's other prose writings,<ref name="Maslin"> </ref> and a noticeable generosity towards friends and lovers of his early years.<ref>{{cite web

In these passages, Dylan suggested the process which ignited his own song writing.

''Chronicles: Volume One'' reached number two on ''[[The New York Times]]''' Hardcover Non-Fiction best seller list in December 2004 and was nominated for a [[National Book Award]]. Simultaneously, [[Amazon.com]] and [[Barnes & Noble]] reported the book as their number two best-seller among all categories.<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 136<U+2013>8</ref> ''Chronicles: Volume One'' is the first of three planned volumes.
