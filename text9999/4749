==History==

{{For| individual popstars and music era coverage|cantopop|mandopop}}
From [[1920]] to [[1949]] in the [[Republic of China]], ''"Chinese popular music"'' was the main title used to describe all contemporary music sang in Chinese dialects in [[Shanghai]].  It was founded by [[Li Jinhui]].  [[Buck Clayton]] is also credited to bringing [[United States|American]] [[jazz]] influence to the east. The music gained popularity in hangout quarters of nightclubs and dancehalls of major cities in the 1920s.  A number of privately-run radio stations were spawned from the late 1920s to 50s to play c-pop music<ref name="Miller">Miller, Toby. [2003] (2003).

Around the time of the [[Invasion of Manchuria|Japanese Invasion of Manchuria]] and the [[Chinese Civil War]], pop music was seen as a [[leftist]] distraction.  After the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and [[World War II]], c-pop has been marketed, produced and branded regionally.

The [[Communist Party of China|CPC]], remained in mainland China.  After establishing the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949.  One of the first actions taken was labeling the genre "[[Yellow Music]]", where the color is associated with [[pornography]].  [[Baak Doi]] would take pop music to Hong Kong, and develop [[cantopop]].

The  [[Kuomintang|KMT]], relocated to [[Taiwan]].  After establishing the [[Republic of China]].  From 1950s to the late 1980s, the native [[Taiwanese language]] was discouraged by the government [[Taiwanese (linguistics)#Politics|(see politics here)]].  As a result, [[Taiwanese pop]] was phased out, making [[mandopop]] the main music genre.

==Market==
Economically [[mandarin pop]] has the potential due to its sizeable market in the mainland. Though the prosperity of mandopop over cantopop will come down to how much better it utilizes online stores and other new sales methods. Ultimately the entire market of "Chinese Music" is at the mercy of [[piracy]]. In particular serious hindrance exist in the mainland<ref name="CBM">China Briefing Media.

==Musical styles==
The gap between cantopop and mandopop have been narrowing since the [[2000|new millenium]].  C-pop covers many musical styles, including [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[ballad]]s, [[Pop music|pop]], [[rock music|light rock]] and some variation of [[hip hop]].  In particular, [[Chinese rock]] have only began to separate away from c-pop in the early 1990s.  [[Chinese hip hop]] has started to come to its own in the 2000s.
