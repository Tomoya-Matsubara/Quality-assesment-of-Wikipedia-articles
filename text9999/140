In 1892 '''William H. White''' published "The Architect and his artists, an essay to assist the public in considering the question is architecture a profession or an art" in reply to "Architecture, a Profession or an Art" edited by [[Norman Shaw]] and [[T. G. Jackson]].

This had been part of the course of events which resulted in the passing of the the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938]] which established the statutory [[Architects Registration in the United Kingdom| Register of Architects]] and [[monopoly| monopolistic]] restrictions on the use of the [[vernacular]] word "[[architect]]", imposed with threat of [[penalty]] on [[prosecution]] for [[infringement]].

The keeping of the Register of Architects is now governed by the Architects Act 1997, and the name of the body responsible for the Register has been changed from the [[Architects Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] (ARCUK) to the [[Architects Registration Board]] (ARB).
