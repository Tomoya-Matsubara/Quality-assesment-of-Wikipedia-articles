The '''bombing of Banski dvori''' ({{lang-hr|bombardiranje Banskih dvora}}) was a [[Yugoslav People's Army]] air strike on [[Banski dvori]] in [[Zagreb]], during the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. The Banski dvori were the [[official residence]] of the [[President of Croatia]] at the time. The bombing occurred on 7 October 1991, when the [[Yugoslav Air Force]] attacked Banski dvori and other targets in the [[Gradec, Zagreb|Gornji Grad]] area of [[Zagreb]] and elsewhere in the Croatian capital city. Zagreb was attacked by approximately 30 Yugoslav jets, however the Gornji Grad raid was carried out by two [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21s]] carrying eight ''Munja'' {{convert|128|mm|adj=on}} [[unguided missile]]s each and two [[Soko G-4 Super Galeb]]s carrying two [[Mark 82 bomb]]s each. The Banski dvori building was struck by the Mark 82 bombs set off by [[proximity fuze]]s {{convert|5|m|abbr=off}} above the target, scoring two direct hits. One civilian was reported killed by the aircraft [[strafing]] of the [[Tu<U+0161>kanac]] area of Gornji Grad and four were injured.

At the time of the attack Croatian President [[Franjo Tu<U+0111>man]] was in the building, meeting [[Stjepan Mesi<U+0107>]], then [[President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia]] and [[Ante Markovi<U+0107>]], the then [[Prime Minister of Yugoslavia]], both ethnic [[Croats]]&mdash;in an attempt to persuade Markovi<U+0107> to leave his position as the head of the Yugoslav federal government. None of them were injured in the attack. In immediate aftermath of the event, Tu<U+0111>man said that the attack appeared to have been meant to destroy Banski dvori as the seat of the [[State (polity)|statehood]] of Croatia. Markovi<U+0107> blamed Yugoslav defence secretary [[General]] [[Veljko Kadijevi<U+0107>]] for the attack, demanding his resignation. The Yugoslav defence ministry brushed away the accusation, claiming that the attack was not authorized by the central command and suggesting that the event might have been stage-managed by the Croatian authorities. In response, the [[United States]] advised US nationals to leave Croatia. The [[United States Department of State]] announced that it would consider introducing [[economic sanctions]] against Yugoslavia. [[Germany]] condemned the attack, calling it barbarous, and blamed it on the Yugoslav military. 

After the bombing, the residence of the President of Croatia was moved from Banski dvori to the [[Presidential Palace, Zagreb|Presidential palace]]&mdash;formerly known as ''Villa Zagorje''. The Banski dvori, and the surrounding buildings, sustained significant damage, but repairs started only in 1995. After the repairs, the building became the seat of the [[Government of Croatia]].

According to [[Martin <U+0160>pegelj]], who held the post of [[Ministry of Defence (Croatia)|defense minister of Croatia]] between August 1990 and July 1991, the Croatian Army was informed by a Yugoslav Air Force [[<U+017D>eljava Air Base]]-based source about a top secret mission prepared for the next day, but <U+0160>pegelj claims that the information was not taken seriously due to lack of details.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.hr/books?ei=bMhxUOXCH8744QSyjoGIDQ&hl=hr&id=cwM1AAAAMAAJ|title=Sje<U+0107>anja vojnika|language=Croatian|trans_title=Memories of a Soldier|year=2001|publisher=Znanje|page=148|author=Martin <U+0160>pegelj|accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref> Other sources assert that a warning was conveyed by [[Croatian security and intelligence system]] services,<ref name="VL21"/> indicating the [[Soviet Union]] and its then-[[President of the Soviet Union|president]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] as the source of the information.<ref name="JL21"/> At midnight during the night of the 6&ndash;7 October, the Soviet ambassador to [[Belgrade]] was reported to have received instructions to deliver a Soviet warning to the Yugoslav military against attacking Zagreb. The instructions contained information on imminent military action.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Boca Raton News]]|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1290&dat=19911008&id=B98qAAAAIBAJ&sjid=d40DAAAAIBAJ&pg=1614,4031258|title=Gorbachev tells Yugoslavs to end attack|agency=[[The Washington Post]]|date=8 October 1991|accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref>

Tu<U+0111>man spent the night in a [[Croatian Air Force and Air Defence]] command post&mdash;a tunnel running under the Gornji Grad&mdash;where information on the movement of Yugoslav aircraft was relayed. In the morning, Yugoslav General Andrija Ra<U+0161>eta informed the press that his superiors may decide to attack Zagreb as a form of pressure on Tu<U+0111>man.<ref name=CT08>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-10-08/news/9104010052_1_croatian-national-guard-croatian-president-franjo-tudjman-unconditional-cease-fire|title=Croatian Capital Hit By Missiles|author=Ray Moseley|date=8 October 1991|accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref> Three [[air raid alarm]]s were sounded during the morning of 7 October because the Yugoslav Air Force deployed as many as 30 to 40 combat jets in the Zagreb area, and numerous tip-offs of imminent air raids were received from Yugoslav military bases. During the morning, Yugoslav Air Force jets were observed taking off from bases near [[Pula]] and [[Udbina]] in Croatia and [[Banja Luka]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina. No flights were recorded taking off from <U+017D>eljava Air Base, presumably because of low cloud cover in the area. At 1:30&nbsp;pm, the Croatian Army captured a Yugoslav military communications centre and [[radar]] post near [[Velika Buna]], south of Zagreb, hindering Yugoslav Air Force control of aircraft in the area. It is believed that the event affected the timing of the raid on the Banski dvori,<ref name="VL21"/> the [[official residence]] of the [[President of Croatia]] at the time.<ref name="JL-Pantov<U+010D>ak"/>

Approximately at noon of 7 October 1991, Tu<U+0111>man met with [[Stjepan Mesi<U+0107>]], then [[President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia]] and [[Ante Markovi<U+0107>]], the then [[Prime Minister of Yugoslavia]], both ethnic [[Croats]], in Banski dvori.<ref name="NYTimes-BanskiDvoriRaid-8Oct1991">{{cite news | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/08/world/yugoslav-planes-attack-croatian-presidential-palace.html | title = Yugoslav Planes Attack Croatian Presidential Palace | date = 8 October 1991 | accessdate= 7 October, 2012}}</ref> The purpose of the meeting was to persuade Markovi<U+0107> to leave his position as the head of the Yugoslav federal government, which he appeared reluctant to do,<ref name="Nova21"/> and to discuss the need for Croatia's independence.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Nova TV (Croatia)]]|url= http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/mesic-drzali-smo-se-za-ruke-i-izasli-da-sam-poginuo-umjesto-mene-bi-dosao-najveci-srbin.html|title=Da sam poginuo naslijedio bi me Srbin ve<U+0107>i od svakog Srbina|language=Croatian|trans_title=If I were killed, I would have been succeeded by a Serb that was the biggest nationalist than any other|author=Tatjana Kraja<U+010D>|date=7 October 2011|accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref> The meeting was adjourned for lunch that was to be attended by presidential aides.
