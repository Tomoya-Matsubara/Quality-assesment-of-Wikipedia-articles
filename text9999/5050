The '''University of Delaware''' (colloquially "'''UD'''" or "'''UDel'''") is the largest university in [[Delaware]]. The main campus is in [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]], with satellite campuses in [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]], [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]] and [[Georgetown, Delaware|Georgetown]]. It is medium-sized <U+2013> approximately 16,000 undergraduate and 3,500 [[graduate student]]s. Although UD receives public funding for being a [[land-grant]], [[sea-grant]], [[space-grant]] and [[urban-grant]] state-supported research institution, it is also privately [[charter]]ed.<ref>[http://udcatalog.udel.edu/general/general/university.html UD Catalog - General Information<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> At present, the school's endowment is valued at about $1.3975 billion US.  The University of Delaware is ranked 68th by US News in the category of "Best National Universities." [http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/newark-de/university-of-delaware-1431] In 2009, UD ranked No. 22 in the in-state category of [[Kiplinger's Personal Finance]] magazine's list of the 100 Best Values in Public Colleges, and No. 18 for out-of-state.<ref>[http://www.kiplinger.com/tools/colleges/ Kiplinger.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The school from which the university grew was founded in 1743, making it one of the oldest in the nation. However, UD was not chartered as an institution of higher learning until 1833. Its original class of ten students included [[George Read (signer)|George Read]], [[Thomas McKean]], and [[James Smith (political figure)|James Smith]], all three of whom would go on to sign the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]]. 

The school has renowned engineering, science, business, education, urban affairs and public policy, [[public administration]], agriculture, history, [[chemical engineering]], [[chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]] programs, among others, drawing from the historically strong presence of the nation's chemical and [[pharmaceutical]] industries in the state of Delaware. In 2006, UD's engineering program was ranked number 10 in the nation by [[The Princeton Review]]. In 2009, [[US News and World Report]], ranked the chemical engineering program 10th among undergraduate programs and 9th among graduate programs. It is one of only four schools in North America with a major in [[Art conservation and restoration|art conservation]]. UD was the first American university to begin a study abroad program.<ref>[http://www.udel.edu/PR/SpecialUDelivery/vol1no1/anniversary.html]</ref>

== Organization and student body ==
[[Image:UDelaware1-09.JPG|right|350px|thumbnail|Aerial View of the University of Delaware's Green]]

The university is organized into 7 colleges: 
* College of Agriculture and Natural Resources 
* College of Arts and Sciences 
* Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economics 
* College of Earth, Ocean and Environment
* College of Engineering
* College of Health Sciences 
* College of Education and Public Policy  

The College of Arts and Sciences is the largest of the colleges.  Also, on April 3, 2007 the second annual [[BusinessWeek]] review of the "Best Undergraduate B-Schools" ranked UD's Lerner College of Business and Economics 29th among the nation's top 58 public university programs and 61st among the 500 schools earning international accreditation from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.[http://www.udel.edu/PR/UDaily/2007/apr/bschools040307.html]

In recent years, the student body has been labeled as one of the most politically apathetic in the nation. Although there are a number of activist student groups on campus, the University was ranked 4th out of 361 schools in the "Election? What Election?" category in the Princeton Review's 2007 college ratings <ref>http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/rankings/rankingDetails.asp?CategoryID=5&TopicID=42</ref>. 

This perception is quickly changing however, and such rankings have not gone unnoticed by university officials.  An April 2008 report by the school's Strategic Planning Committee identified student engagement in the "social, cultural, artistic, and scientific challenges of our age" as one of the university's primary long-term goals<ref>http://www.udel.edu/strategicplanning/SPC_Report_Apr_08.pdf</ref>. University students have also responded to the charges of student apathy, and the 2007-2008 academic year saw the creation of a number of student organizations aimed at increasing political dialogue amongst undergraduates <ref>[http://www.udel.edu/RSO/specialint.html Student Organizations - Special Interest<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

The 2008 Presidential Election has also brought much attention to the University and has increased student involvement in political activism.  In August 2008, the University was hailed as the "epicenter" of the presidential election by [[Bloomberg News]] <ref>http://www.udel.edu/udaily/2009/aug/politics082808.html</ref>. [[Joe Biden]] (D), Delaware, who graduated from the University, was elected Vice President of the United States on November 4, 2008 as [[Barack Obama]]'s running mate.  In addition, Biden's wife, Jill, as well as [[David Plouffe]], Obama's campaign strategist, and [[Steve Schmidt]], McCain's campaign strategist all graduated from UD.  Senator Biden appeared at the University in a campaign rally on October 31, 2008, just days before the election, in front of an estimated crowd of 7,000.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009|7,000?

The student body at the University of Delaware is largely an undergraduate population.  The University of Delaware offers over 100 undergraduate degrees, and due to the vast number of academic options many students complete dual degrees as well as double majors and minors. Delaware students have a great deal of access to work and internship opportunities.  An easily accessible online database contains over 1,000 internship opportunities available for all majors. The Center hosts 15 major career fairs with over 500 employers in attendance and the Campus Interview Program, which brings over 600 employer representatives to campus. Like other corporate players that call Delaware home, [[MBNA]] (now  [[Bank of America]]) invests in the UD community through the construction of the new Career Services Center building, the hiring of students, and sponsorship of scholarships. With Delaware's location in [[Newark, Delaware]], students are able to land jobs and internships in Delaware, as well as in [[New York]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], [[Baltimore]], and [[Washington, D.C.]].   More than 90% of Delaware graduates who do not go directly to graduate school report finding full-time positions within six months of graduating.<ref>{{cite web

Additionally, "4+1" Accelerated Programs also allow students to pursue both their bachelor's and master's degrees within a five-year period. Opportunities in the College of Human Services, Education and Public Policy exist to acquire a bachelor's in leadership and a master's in public administration. Students may also pursue a bachelor's degree in hotel management and a master's in business administration through a "4+1+1" program where students work for one year between the undergraduate and graduate experiences. Students in the College of Engineering can pursue a bachelor's degree in one of the University's engineering disciplines and a master's in business administration.

The Medical Scholars Program is an opportunity for academically competitive students who wish to pursue careers in the medical profession. Successful participation in the Medical Scholars Program leads to a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies from the University of Delaware and the M.D. degree from [[Thomas Jefferson University|Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia]].

The Ronald McNair Post-Baccalaureate Achievement Program is an initiative to prepare and empower low-income, first generation college students and underrepresented students (of African American, Latino, and Native American descent) for doctoral study; allowing them to complete a Baccalaureate degree, enroll in graduate school, and ultimately attain a doctoral degree. Since its inception at Delaware, the program boasts a 100% placement rate of its scholars in graduate programs across the country.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Lastly, the Dean's Scholar Program is designed to serve the needs of a highly selective group of students who are motivated and talented and have a clear view of their long-range educational goals. Dean's Scholars are granted flexibility in college requirements so that they can build their entire program with faculty advisers and create original programs of study, including off-campus experiences and independent research. This opportunity is available to outstanding sophomores in the Colleges of Arts and Science, Agriculture and Natural Resources, Health and Nursing Sciences, and Education and Public Policy.

=== College of Engineering ===
The University of Delaware College of Engineering traces its beginnings to 1837, when a class in "surveying and leveling" was first taught at Newark College. Civil engineering became part of the science curriculum in 1850, but degree programs were not established until 1889 for Civil Engineering, 1891 for Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, and 1914 for Chemical Engineering. In the early 1920s, the University of Delaware was known primarily for its engineering school, with more than half of the institution's entire student body enrolled in one of the four engineering disciplines. Long recognized for its emphasis on teaching, the College of Engineering endeavored to establish strong research and graduate programs as well. [[World War II]] brought the first significant funding for research, setting a new pattern for the institution. By 1960, Chemical Engineering's graduate education and research initiatives had earned the department national prominence. In the early 1970s, the Mechanical Engineering department became one of the first in the country to teach composite materials, leading to the creation of the internationally recognized Center for Composite Materials [http://www.ccm.udel.edu]. The new interdisciplinary research center created a unique model for industry cooperation and led the College to establish eight more research centers over the next 30 years. Materials Science, founded in 1960 as a program, was established as the College's fifth department in 1998. Today, the College of Engineering continues a proud tradition of excellence in research, teaching and service that has brought prestigious national accolades to both faculty and students.

Research in these and other areas is done in collaboration with faculty at Delaware State University, Delaware Technical and Community College, Wesley College, Christinia Care Health Systems, and Nemours Hospital for Children.  One of the primary objectives of the Institute is to provide state-of-the-art research equipment to facilitate life science research and six core instrumentation centers and specialized facilities, each under the direction of an experienced researcher or administrator, is supported at DBI and made available to University researchers.

=== Delaware Environmental Institute ===
The Delaware Environmental Institute (DENIN) launched October 23, 2009. DENIN is charged with conducting research and promoting and coordinating knowledge partnerships that integrate environmental science, engineering and policy. [http://denin.udel.edu]

=== University of Delaware Energy Institute ===
The University of Delaware Energy Institute (DEI) was inaugurated September 19, 2008. DEI has been selected to receive a $3 million a year grant for advanced solar research. [http://www.energy.udel.edu/index.html]

== History ==
The University of Delaware traces its founding to 1743, when Presbyterian minister [[Francis Alison]] opened up his "Free School" in his home in [[New London, Pennsylvania]]. The school changed its name and location several times, ending up as the Academy of Newark in 1769 (chartered by the colonial government).  Since Delaware was part of the Pennsylvania colony until 1776, the academy was denied charter as a college in order to prevent its competing with the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (then known as the '''College of Philadelphia'''). In 1833, the General assembly for the State of Delaware passed the "An Act to Establish a College at Newark", and the next year, Newark College opened. It changed its name in 1843 to Delaware College and it merged with the Academy of Newark. The school closed from 1859 until 1870 (Newark Academy separated from the college in 1869). On March 28, 1921, by another act of state assembly, it merged with the nearby Delaware Women's college (founded in 1913) to form the University.

On October 23, 2009 the University of Delaware signed an agreement with [[Chrysler]] to purchase a 272-acre closed vehicle assembly plant adjacent to the University for expansion for $24.25 million as part of Chrysler's bankruptcy restructuring plan.<ref>http://www.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2009910240360</ref> 

=== Security ===
The University recently implemented a system named UD Alert, to alert students and faculty of emergencies on campus by sending text, voice, and e-mail messages to the individuals [http://www.udel.edu/PR/UDaily/2008/sep/update090807.html].  The University was also one of the original campuses in the country to implement the "blue light" emergency phone system in the late 1980s.

==== Residence Life controversy ====
In October 2007, the Office of Residence Life's diversity program was criticized by several students, and faculty as well as the [[Foundation for Individual Rights in Education]] (FIRE) for infringing on students rights. FIRE argued that residence hall programs, one on ones and floor meetings administered through [[resident assistant]]s forced students into accepting "university-approved ideologies." FIRE specifically criticized programs dealing with issues of [[sexual identity]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], and [[sustainability]].[http://s3.amazonaws.com/thefirecache/8555.html?PHPSESSID=de4a52a600d045acb9b6ab5daf011fd9][http://cbs3.com/delawarewire/22.0.html?type=nplocal&state=DE&category=News&filename=DE--University-Ideolo.xml] The controversy originated from training programs given to resident assistants that suggested all white people were inherently [[racist]], and because minorities were not in the majority, they could not be racist. The program was suspended on November 1, 2007, with university president Patrick T.  Harker quoted as saying, "There are questions about its practices that must be addressed and there are reasons for concern that the actual purpose is not being fulfilled."[http://chronicle.com/subscribe/login?url=/daily/2007/11/586n.htm]  In May 2008, against some student protest, the University reinstated an amended version of the previous program. [http://www.udel.edu/PR/UDaily/2008/may/senate051208.html] The [[National Association of Scholars]](NAS), an [[education reform]] group, and an early critic of the Residence Life program, called the amended version a repackaging of the original program. Said the NAS: "The submission is essentially a repeat of its predecessor program. Some of the text has been re-worded but its meaning remains unchanged."<ref>[http://www.nas.org/polPressReleases.cfm NAS - The National Association of Scholars :: Press Releases<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The program was also criticized by [[Wall Street Journal]] commentator Naomi Schaeffer Riley.[http://www.naomiriley.com/] Riley, among other things, criticized loose definitions of environmental sustainability that include "Fair Trade", "Affirmative Action", "Multicultural Competence" and "Domestic Partnerships".<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121150025195715831.html?mod=googlenews_wsj Heaven Sustain Us: Environmentalists Have Taken Over the Dorms - WSJ.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Architecture ==
[[Image:UDel south green memorial.jpg|right|thumbnail|South Green at the University of Delaware]]
In 1891, prominent Philadelphia architect [[Frank Furness]] designed Recitation Hall.<ref>[http://www.philadelphiabuildings.org/pab/app/image_gallery.cfm?RecordId=F2A42DF5-44F6-405B-9FB3FB33A6B8B350 Recitation Hall] from Philadelphia Architects and Buildings</ref>

The recent history of the university has been marked by massive construction projects. North or Laird Campus, formerly home to the Pencader Complex, has been entirely redesigned and renamed Independence Complex. This began with the construction of a Marriott Courtyard run by the HRIM (Hotel Restaurant and Institutional Management) department. Three new residence hall buildings have also been built and named after the three University Alumni who signed the Declaration of Independence, [[George Read (signer)|George Read]], [[Thomas McKean]] and [[James Smith (political figure)|James Smith]] (who signed for Pennsylvania). The third Delaware signer, [[Caesar Rodney]], already had a dorm complex named after him on West Campus. A fourth residence hall opened for the Fall of 2008, named Independence Hall; the building is split into East and West wings.<ref>[http://www.facilities.udel.edu/rhalls.aspx University of Delaware Facilities Website - Residence Halls Information<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

New academic buildings have also been constructed recently. In 2006, the Center For The Arts had its grand opening, with new facilities for the school's music and theater programs. Also in 2006, Jastak-Burgess Hall opened, now home to the Department of Foreign Languages and Literature. In 1998, Gore Hall opened on the Green and connects to Smith Hall via an overpass on South College Avenue. Other recent construction projects include Alfred Lerner Hall (for business) and massive renovations to DuPont Hall, Wolf Hall, and Memorial Hall.

== Administration ==
The University is currently headed by its 26th President [[Patrick T. Harker]], who was formerly dean of the [[Wharton School]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]].  Previous President [[David Roselle|David P. Roselle]] retired at the end of the 2006<U+2013>2007 academic year.<ref>{{cite news

== Study abroad ==
The University of Delaware was the first [[United States|American]] university to begin a [[study abroad]] program, which was later adopted by many other institutions.<ref>[http://www.udel.edu/PR/SpecialUDelivery/vol1no1/anniversary.html Study abroad celebrates 75th anniversary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The program began when Professor [[Raymond Watson Kirkbride]] took a group of 9 students to [[Paris, France]] during the fall semester of 1923.  Since this initial trip, the University of Delaware has expanded its study abroad program, which now encompasses over 75 different programs in more than 40 subjects to over 35 countries on all seven [[continents]] making it one of the largest programs in the country. As of 2006-2007, approximately 45% of all Delaware undergraduate students take advantage of study abroad experiences prior to completing their baccalaureate degrees.

Delaware's study abroad program offers many options for students.  Undergraduates have the option of studying abroad for a five-week winter session, or an entire semester.

The athletic teams at Delaware are known as the Fightin' Blue Hens with a mascot named [[YoUDee]].  YoUDee is a [[Blue Hen Chicken]], after the team names and the state bird of [[Delaware]]. YoUDee was the 2002 UCA National Mascot Champion and was elected into the mascot hall of fame in 2006.

UD offers 23 varsity sports, which compete in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division-I]] ([[Division I-AA#Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]] for football).  Delaware is a member of the [[Colonial Athletic Association]] (CAA) in all sports.  Delaware was a member of the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]] in football until the 2006 season. Football is the most popular and most successful sport at Delaware. The Fighting Blue Hens football teams have won Six National Titles, including the 2003 NCAA I-AA Championship.  In 2007, the Delaware Blue Hens were the runners up in the NCAA I-AA National Championship game, but were defeated by (defending champions) Appalachian State.

Former head football coaches Bill Murray, [[David M. Nelson|Dave Nelson]] and [[Harold "Tubby" Raymond]] are College Football Hall of Fame inductees.  Delaware is one of only two schools to have three straight head coaches inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame ([[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] is the other).<ref>[http://www.udel.edu/PR/UDaily/2003/tubby042503.html Tubby Raymond named to College Football Hall of Fame<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Delaware's only other NCAA National Championship came in 1983 for Women's Division I Lacrosse.<ref>[http://www.ncaasports.com/lacrosse/womens/story/9374807 NCAA.com - The Official Web Site of the NCAA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The Blue Hens have won three CAA Championship, since joining in 2001 (although unofficially the women's rowing team has won the CAA title four times since 2001, placing second the other two times). One each for the women's 2004 field hockey team, the 2007 men's lacrosse team and the 2007 women's volleyball team.

The University of Delaware has a variety of musical performance opportunities available to students, including a wind ensemble, orchestra, symphonic band.  There are also a number of jazz groups available, including two large ensembles, and a smaller group that focus on improvisation.  All ensembles are open by audition to all students at the university, and can be taken either for credit or for no credit.  The school also has a [[steel drum]] ensemble, and an early music ensemble.  There are also a variety of choral ensembles, including the University of Delaware Chorale, an all-women's choir, and three choirs, also open to community members, that constitute the Schola Cantorum.  The music department's home is the Amy E. Dupont Music Building, named for [[Amy Elizabeth du Pont]], a prominent benefactor of the University during the early 20th century.

In addition, the University of Delaware is known for having one of the best marching bands on the east coast, the University of Delaware Fightin' Blue Hen Marching Band. The band ranges from 300 to 350 members every year and can be seen performing at every home football game as well as at various festivals and competitions, including the [[Collegiate Marching Band Festival]] in Allentown, PA.  Additionally, the marching band was selected to perform in the [[Barack Obama 2009 presidential inauguration#Parade|56th Presidential Inaugural Parade in 2009]].<ref>[http://www.udel.edu/udaily/2009/dec/marchingband120908.html UDaily article: University's marching band selected for inaugural parade]</ref>

In 2006, the new Center for the Arts building opened.  This building has a number of recital halls and a large number of practice rooms, most with upright pianos.  The practice rooms are locked and cannot be used by students who are not music majors or in an official UD ensemble.  The university employs a tiered access system, with larger rooms and rooms with grand pianos being reserved for certain groups of students.  In addition the music department also uses their old building, with offices, classrooms, practice rooms, and recital halls.  This building has public-access practice rooms with pianos.

In 2004, the University of Delaware Chorale, under the direction of Dr. Paul D. Head and accompanied by Betsy Kent, were invited to perform at the [[American Choral Directors Association]]'s International Convention in [[Los Angeles]].  In April 2007, the Chorale won the Grand Prix at the Tallinn International Choral Festival, having scored higher than 40 other choirs from around the world. In 2000, the music department purchased an 18th century Ceruti violin for professor and [[virtuoso]] violinist [[Xiang Gao]].  This investment of nearly $300,000 USD has more than tripled in value.  Recently Prof. Gao has been granted use of a Stradivarius Violin.

The University also has a student run radio station, 91.3 [[WVUD]].

There are currently three [[student newspaper]]s at Delaware: ''The Review'', the ''Lamplighter'', and the ''Mainstreet Journal''.

The Review is a weekly publication, released in print on Tuesdays and an online-only edition on Fridays. It is the school's official paper and is written with support from the University.  It is distributed at several locations across campus, including Morris Library, the Perkins Student Center and the Trabant University Center, as well as various academic buildings and the dining halls.

In 2004, it was a [[National Newspaper Pacemaker Award]] Finalist, and was also named one of the ten best non-daily college newspapers by the [[Associated Collegiate Press]].<ref>[http://www.udreview.com/home/generalinformation/ The Review<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> They currently have a print circulation of 11,000.

The Lamplighter is a semesterly publication.  It is an independent student paper written without support from or restriction by the University's administration.  The Mainstreet Journal focuses on creative writing.  

The student-run, non-commercial, educational [[radio station]] at Delaware [[broadcasts]] on 91.3 and uses the [[call letters]] [[WVUD]], which the University purchased from the University of Dayton in the 1980s. Although not its intended call letter pronunciation, 'VUD has taken on the slogan "the Voice of the University of Delaware." They are licensed by the city of [[Newark, Delaware]] and broadcasts with a power of 1,000 [[watt]]s 24 hours a day with its offices and studios located in the Perkins Student Center.<ref>[http://www.wvud.org/ Welcome to WVUD!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The transmitting facilities are located atop the Christiana East [[residence hall]]. WVUD is operated by University of Delaware students, a University staff of two, and community members. No prior radio experience is necessary, nor is there a need to enroll in any certain major to become a part of WVUD. The radio station has a variety of programming, featuring both music and talk formats.

In 2002, DEconstruction Magazine was formed "to create a forum for student writing that fell outside of journalism or creative writing. Traditionally, DEconstruction focused on an editorial style of writing to discuss everything from politics to pop culture."<ref>[http://deconstruction.wordpress.com/about/ About <U+00AB> DEconstruction Magazine]</ref>

Another student magazine, aUDio, was announced in Fall 2007. They aim to be "the University of Delaware's first online music magazine." <ref>[http://www.audiomag.org/ aUDiomag.org]</ref> To celebrate their launch, there was a concert on November 29, 2007, in the Trabant University Center.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

STN is the student-run, non-commercial, educational [[television station]] at the University of Delaware.  The station broadcasts second-run movies, original student produced content as well as live sports coverage.

== Greek life ==
Approximately 15% of Delaware's undergraduate population is affiliated with a [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity or sorority]].  There are over 19 fraternities and 15 sororities (chapters & colonies) in the [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|Interfraternity Council]] (IFC), [[National Panhellenic Conference]] (NPC), and [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]] (NPHC). They all coordinate via the Greek Council.  All Greek organizations participate in an accreditation process called the [http://www.udel.edu/student-centers/FandS/cap.html Chapter Assessment Program (CAP)].  CAP ratings award chapters with either a Gold, Silver, Bronze, Satisfactory or Needs Improvement designation. This system is an expansion from the Five Star program of the late 1990s, requiring contributions to community service, philanthropy, university events, diversity education, professional education, a chapter/colony GPA greater than or equal to the all men's or all women's average, and attendance and compliance with numerous other criteria.

Active Fraternities include [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], [[Alpha Gamma Rho]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], [[Sigma Pi]], [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Phi Beta Sigma]], [[Sigma Phi Delta]], [[Delta Sigma Phi]], [[Phi Gamma Delta]], [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], [[Iota Phi Theta]], [[Phi Sigma Kappa]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Kappa Alpha Order]], [[Phi Sigma Pi]], [[Theta Chi]], [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], [[Pi Kappa Phi]], [[Zeta Beta Tau]], and [[Kappa Delta Rho]].

Active Sororities include [[Alpha Delta Pi]], [[Alpha Xi Delta]], [[Sigma Alpha]] , [[Alpha Epsilon Phi]], [[Chi Omega]], [[Sigma Kappa]], [[Alpha Phi]], [[Delta Gamma]], [[Phi Beta Chi]], [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]], [[Delta Sigma Theta]], [[Zeta Phi Beta]], [[Alpha Sigma Alpha]], and [[Kappa Alpha Theta]].

== Alcohol abuse ==
A campus website claims that a 1993 study by the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] found that high-risk drinking at UD exceeded the national norm. On this survey, a majority of students reported binge drinking more than once in a two-week interval. The average consumption for students was nine drinks per week, while 29% reported that they drink on 10 or more occasions per month. Ironically, UD students were found to be more aware of policies, prevention programs, and enforcement risks than the national average.<ref>[http://cte.udel.edu/aboutteach/spr98/bishop.html Bishop, Binge Drinking in College<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 2005, on the Newark campus of the university 1140 students were picked up by the campus police for alcohol-related violations. Of these, 120 led to arrests. These figures are up from previous years, 1062 in 2004 and 1026 in 2003.<ref>[http://www.udel.edu/PublicSafety/crimestats.htm Crime Statistics]</ref> This represents approximately 6% of the student population.<ref>[http://www.udel.edu/IR/fnf/index.html Facts and Figures]</ref> Caution must be used in interpreting these figures; a higher number of reported violations may represent more enforcement, not necessarily more actual violations. 

UD has expended considerable effort and financial resources to reduce the drinking problem on campus; in 1991 UD founded the Center for Drug and Alcohol Studies. One of the center's major initiatives is a collaborative plan to reduce irresponsible drinking at UD, called "A Matter of Degree"<ref>[http://www.udel.edu/cdas/drinking.html A Matter of Degree]</ref>

Beginning in the fall of 2006, incoming freshman had to complete an online course, AlcoholEdu.

At least one student organization has undertaken the goal of "providing fun activities for those who chose not to drink" and to "promote the idea that one doesn't need alcohol to have a good time."<ref>[http://copland.udel.edu/stu-org/v8/ copland.udel.edu]</ref>

In November 2008, an 18 year old Freshman, Brett Griffin, died of alcohol poisoning at an off campus fraternity party. Griffin was pledging the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity, and was encouraged to drink an entire bottle of "Southern Comfort" before being assigned a fraternity brother.<ref>http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Family-Sues-Sigma-Alpha-Mu-Fraternity-Over-Sons-Death.html</ref> Six UD students have been arrested and charged, and the Griffin family is currently suing the fraternity.
