==Plot==
[[Homer Simpson|Homer]] takes his family to the new [[sushi]] bar, The Happy Sumo. After sampling most of the items on the menu, he tries sushi made from the fish [[fugu]]. The chef in charge is busy having sex with [[Edna Krabappel]], so his apprentice has to slice the fugu, of which certain parts are toxic. The apprentice tries to do it carefully, but Homer starts yelling impatiently, and disturbing the apprentice and forcing him to serve it. Homer considers it a treat, but the chef soon returns and finds that the fish has not been prepared correctly and tells Homer that he may have been poisoned. Homer and Marge go to the hospital, where [[Julius Hibbert|Dr. Hibbert]] informs Homer he is indeed very likely to die and has twenty-two hours left to live. At night with Marge by his side, he decides not to tell his children about the bad news and makes a list of all the things he wants to do before he dies.

On his last day, after oversleeping, Homer attempts to do all the things on his list. He has a man-to-man talk with [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], listens to [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] play her [[Baritone Saxophone|saxophone]], and borrows [[Ned Flanders|Flanders]]'s [[camcorder]] to make a video for [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] that she can look at when she is older. Homer finally reconciles with his father [[Abraham Simpson|Abe]], which takes up far more time than he expects and forces him to give up doing some of the things on his list. After trying to catch up on time he lost doing these things, Homer is arrested for speeding. He calls [[Barney Gumble|Barney]], who is asked to pay $50 to bail him out. Leaving jail and with not much time left, he tells off his boss [[Mr. Burns]] and has one last drink at [[Moe's Tavern]] with his friends, causing him to miss dinner with his waiting family. He then hurries home in time to say goodbye to his children and make love to Marge.

At midnight, Homer quietly gets out of bed, visits each family member, who are all asleep, and says goodbye. Feeling glum, he goes to the living room and listens to [[Larry King]] read the [[Bible]] [[Audiobook|on tape]]. The tape plays out to which suddenly his head drops and it appears he has succumbed to the poison. Marge awakens the next morning and is panicked that her husband is not by her side. She runs downstairs and finds Homer, collapsed in the armchair. As she mourns, she realizes that his drool is still warm. She wakes him up and drums in the fact that he is alive. Homer then prances around in an overjoyed state and vows to live life to its fullest. In typical Homer fashion, he is soon back on the couch watching a bowling tournament and eating [[pork rinds]].

==Production==
[[File:Larry King.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Larry King guest starred in the episode as himself.]]
The episode was written by [[Nell Scovell]] and directed by [[Wes Archer]]. In the episode, Bart and Lisa sneak into the sushi bar's karaoke room and sing the theme song to the 1971 film ''[[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]]'',  "[[Theme from Shaft]]". The Fox network censors originally did not want the staff to use the song because they thought the lyrics were too obscene to appear on television. In order to prove the censors wrong and show that it could appear on television, the staff dug up footage from an old [[Academy Awards]] ceremony at which the song was performed by [[Isaac Hayes]].<ref name="Jean">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|date=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> When the chef of the sushi bar finds out that Homer has been poisoned, he yells at his apprentices in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said that despite a "potentially gimmicky tone", the episode provided "a lot of fun moments along with a little emotional content as well. The show usually balanced sentimentality cleanly, and that occurred here; it avoided becoming too syrupy and featured just enough emotion to make an impact. It also contained some great bits, like Lisa and Bart<U+2019>s karaoke performance of the 'Theme from Shaft'. It also ended on a hilarious and incisive note."<ref name="dvdmg"/> Jacobson's favorite line of the episode was the sushi restaurant hostess's "This is our karaoke bar. Now it is empty, but soon it will be hopping with drunken Japanese businessmen."<ref name="dvdmg">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseason2.shtml|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season |last=Jacobson|first=Colin|publisher=DVD Movie Guide|accessdate=2009-03-23}}</ref> The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: "Again, a playful dig at racial stereotypes.

In a review of the second season, Bryce Wilson of [[Cinema Blend]] commented: "The worst moments of this season are merely uninspired, never truly horrible. Slight misses like <U+201C>[[Dancin' Homer]]<U+201D>, <U+201C>One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish<U+201D>, <U+201C>[[Bart's Dog Gets an F]]<U+201D>, and <U+201C>[[The War of the Simpsons]]<U+201D> are a bit flat. But even in their lowest points, humor is easy to find."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/review.php?id=494|title=The Simpsons - The Complete Second Season - DVD|last=Wilson|first=Bryce|date=April 19, 2004|publisher=Cinema Blend|accessdate=2009-03-23}}</ref> Jeremy Roebuck of [[KVUE]] named the episode, along with "[[Bart Sells His Soul]]", "[[Homer the Heretic]]", "[[Simpsons Bible Stories]]", and "[[She of Little Faith]]", one of the best ''Simpsons'' episodes with a religious theme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kvue.com/news/state/stories/102805kvuePastor-cb.478a0b1.html|title=Pastor uses 'Simpsons' to help keep the faith|last=Roebuck|first=Jeremy|date=October 28, 2005|publisher=KVUE|accessdate=2009-03-24}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought Homer's line to Bart, "I want to share something with you, the three little sentences that will get you through life. Number one: 'Cover for me.' Number two: 'Oh, good idea, boss.' Number three, 'It was like that when I got here.'", was the best line of the episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdjournal.com/reviews/s/simpsons.season02.shtml|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season|last=Taylor|first=Dawn|date=2002|publisher=The DVD Journal|accessdate=2009-03-23}}</ref>
