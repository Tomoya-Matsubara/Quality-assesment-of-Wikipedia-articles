'''''Pobeda''''', ({{lang-ru|<U+041F><U+043E><U+0431><U+0435><U+0434><U+0430>|Victory}}), was the last of the three {{sclass|Peresvet|battleship|0}} [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s built for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] at the end of the nineteenth century. The ship was assigned to the [[Russian Pacific Fleet|Pacific Squadron]] upon completion and based at [[L<U+00FC>shunkou District|Port Arthur]] from 1903. During the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904<U+2013>1905, she participated in the [[Battle of Port Arthur|battles of Port Arthur]] and the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea|Yellow Sea]]. Having escaped serious damage in these engagements, ''Pobeda'' was sunk by [[siege gun|gunfire]] during the [[Siege of Port Arthur]], and then [[marine salvage|salvaged]] by the Japanese and placed into service under the name {{nihongo|'''''Suwo'''''|<U+5468><U+9632>|}}.

Rearmed and re-boilered by the Japanese, ''Suwo'' was reclassified by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) as a [[coastal defense ship]] in 1908 and served as a [[training ship]] for several years. She was the [[flagship]] of the Japanese squadron that participated in the [[Battle of Tsingtao]] at the beginning of [[World War I]] and continued in that role until she became a gunnery training ship in 1917. The ship was disarmed in 1922 to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty and probably [[ship breaking|scrapped]] around that time.

==Design and description==
The design of the ''Peresvet'' class was inspired by the [[Royal Navy|British]] second-class battleships (typically faster, but with thinner armor and smaller guns than first-class battleships) of the {{sclass-|Centurion|battleship|4}}. The British ships were intended to defeat commerce-raiding [[armored cruiser]]s like the Russian ships {{ship|Russian cruiser|Rossia||2}} and {{ship|Russian cruiser|Rurik|1892|2}}, and the ''Peresvet'' class was designed to support the armored cruisers. This role placed a premium on high speed and long range at the expense of heavy armament and armor.<ref name=m8>McLaughlin 2003, p. 108</ref>

''Pobeda'' was {{convert|434|ft|5|in|m|1}} [[length overall|long overall]], had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|71|ft|6|in|m}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|26|ft|3|in|m|1}}. Designed to displace {{convert|12674|LT|t|lk=in}}, she was almost {{convert|600|LT|t}} overweight and displaced {{convert|13320|LT|t}}. Her crew consisted of 27 officers and 744 enlisted men. The ship was powered by three [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]] using steam generated by 30 [[Belleville boiler]]s. The engines were rated at {{convert|14500|ihp|lk=in}}, using [[forced draught]], and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|18|kn|lk=in}}. ''Pobeda'', however, reached a top speed of {{convert|18.5|kn}} from {{convert|15578|ihp}} during her [[sea trial]]s in October 1901. She carried a maximum of {{convert|2060|LT|t}} of coal, which allowed her to steam for {{convert|6200|lk=in|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref>McLaughlin 2003, pp. 107<U+2013>08, 114</ref>

The ship's [[main battery]] consisted of four {{convert|10|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns mounted in two twin-[[gun turret]]s, one forward and one aft of the superstructure. The [[Battleship secondary armament|secondary armament]] consisted of eleven [[Canet guns|Canet]] {{convert|6|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF) gun]]s, mounted in [[casemate]]s on the sides of the hull and in the bow, underneath the [[forecastle]]. Several smaller guns were carried for defense against [[torpedo boat]]s. These included twenty {{convert|75|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} QF guns, twenty {{convert|47|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Hotchkiss gun]]s and eight {{convert|37|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} guns. She was also armed with five {{convert|15|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s, three above water and two submerged. The ship carried 45 [[Naval mine|mines]] to be used to protect her anchorage. ''Pobeda''{{'}}s [[waterline]] [[belt armor|armor belt]] consisted of [[Krupp cemented armor]] and was {{convert|4|-|9|in|0}} thick. The armor of her gun turrets had a maximum thickness of {{convert|9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} and her [[deck (ship)|deck]] ranged from {{convert|2|to|3|in|0}} in thickness.<ref>McLaughlin 2003, pp. 107<U+2013>08, 112<U+2013>14</ref>

==Construction and service==
''Pobeda'' (Victory)<ref>Silverstone, p. 382</ref> was ordered on 26 April 1898 from the [[Baltic Shipyard|Baltic Works]] and construction began on 30 May 1898 at the company's [[Saint Petersburg]] shipyard, well before the formal [[keel laying|keel-laying]] ceremony on 21 February 1899.<ref name=m8/> The ship was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 10 May 1900 and towed to [[Kronstadt]] on 31 August 1901 for [[fitting out]]. She made her machinery trials in October, well before she was completed the next year. She sailed to [[Reval]] (modern Tallinn) on 1 August to participate in the naval review held there a few days later to commemorate the visit of the German [[Kaiser]], [[Wilhelm II]], to Russia. ''Pobeda'' entered service upon completing her artillery trials on October 1902, although she was not officially accepted until 10 March 1903,<ref>McLaughlin 2008, pp. 47<U+2013>48</ref> at a cost of 10,050,000 [[rubles]].<ref>McLaughlin 2003, p. 112</ref> She had already sailed from [[Liep<U+0101>ja|Libau]] on 13 November 1902 and arrived at Port Arthur on 13 June 1903 for assignment to the Pacific Squadron.<ref name=m5>McLaughlin 2003, p. 115</ref>

===Battle of Port Arthur===
{{main|Battle of Port Arthur}}
[[File:Pobeda1904Port-Artur.jpg|thumb|''Pobeda'', at anchor probably about March 1904]]
After the Japanese victory in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894<U+2013>95, tensions had arisen between Russia and Japan over their ambitions to control both [[Manchuria]] and Korea. A further issue was the Russian failure to withdraw its troops from Manchuria in October 1903, as it had promised. Japan had begun negotiations to ease the situation in 1901, but the Russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve the problems. Japan interpreted these as deliberate prevarications designed to buy time to complete the Russian armament programs. The final straws were news of Russian timber concessions in northern Korea and the Russian refusal to acknowledge Japanese interests in Manchuria while continuing to place conditions on Japanese activities in Korea. These led the Japanese government to decide in December 1903 that war was now inevitable. The Pacific Squadron began [[wikt:moor|mooring]] in the outer harbor at night as tensions with Japan increased, so as to react more quickly to any Japanese attempt to land troops in Korea.<ref>Westwood, pp. 15<U+2013>21</ref>

On the night of 8/9 February 1904, the IJN launched a [[Battle of Port Arthur|surprise attack]] on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur. ''Pobeda'' was not hit in the initial torpedo-boat attack, and [[sortie]]d the following morning when the [[Combined Fleet]], commanded by [[Vice Admiral]] [[T<U+014D>g<U+014D> Heihachir<U+014D>]], attacked. T<U+014D>g<U+014D> had expected the surprise night attack by his ships to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the [[protected cruiser]] {{ship|Russian cruiser|Boyarin|1901|2}}, which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defenses. T<U+014D>g<U+014D> chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese {{convert|8|in|0|adj=on|sp=in}} and six-inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect. ''Pobeda'' was hit once or twice [[amidships]] near the waterline, losing two men killed and four wounded, but the shell(s) failed to penetrate the ship's armor and little damage was done.<ref>Forczyk, pp. 41<U+2013>43; McLaughlin 2008, p. 48</ref>

On 22 March, ''Pobeda'' joined several other battleships firing indirectly at Japanese ships bombarding Port Arthur's harbor and hit the {{ship|Japanese battleship|Fuji}} once, killing seven men.<ref name=m88>McLaughlin, p. 48</ref> She participated in the action of 13 April, when T<U+014D>g<U+014D> successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron, including Vice Admiral [[Stepan Makarov]]'s [[flagship]], the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Petropavlovsk|1897|2}}. When Makarov spotted the five Japanese battleships, he turned back for Port Arthur, and ''Petropavlovsk'' struck a mine laid by the Japanese the previous night. The ship sank in less than two minutes after one of her [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s exploded, and Makarov was one of the 677 killed. When ''Pobeda'' was returning to port after ''Petropavlovsk'' sank, she struck a mine herself, but was able to steam to the harbor under her own power despite an 11<U+00B0> [[list (watercraft)|list]].<ref>Forczyk, pp. 43, 45<U+2013>46</ref> Her repairs were completed on 9 June although some of her guns were removed during this time to reinforce the defenses of the port. ''Pobeda'' lost a total of three 6-inch, two 75-millimeter, one 47-millimeter and four 37-millimeter guns.<ref>McLaughlin 2003, pp. 115, 163</ref> She sailed with the rest of the Russian squadron on 23 June in an abortive attempt to reach [[Vladivostok]]. The new fleet commander, Vice Admiral [[Wilgelm Vitgeft]], ordered the squadron to return to Port Arthur when it encountered the Japanese fleet shortly before sunset as he did not wish to engage the numerically superior Japanese in a night battle.<ref>Warner & Warner, pp. 305<U+2013>06</ref> ''Pobeda'' bombarded Japanese positions besieging the port on 28 July.<ref name=m88/>

===Battle of the Yellow Sea===
{{main|Battle of the Yellow Sea}}
The Japanese bombardment of 9 August, coupled with a direct order from [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], forced Vitgeft to make another attempt to reach Vladivostok. The squadron sortied in an attempt to escape to Vladivostok the next morning. At 12:25, it was spotted by Japanese cruisers and intercepted by the Combined Fleet in what became the Battle of the Yellow Sea. ''Pobeda'' was third in line during the battle,<ref>Forczyk, p. 48</ref> and was not seriously damaged during the early long-range stage of the action. Around 18:00, two 12-inch shells from the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Asahi||2}} penetrated the conning tower of the Russian flagship {{ship|Russian battleship|Tsesarevich||2}}, killing Vitgeft and the helmsman, severely wounding the [[captain (nautical)|captain]], and causing the ship to come to a dead stop after executing a sharp turn. Thinking that this was a maneuver planned by Vitgeft, the Russian [[battleline]] started to execute the same turn, causing all of the ships directly behind ''Tsesarevich'', including ''Pobeda'', to maneuver wildly to avoid hitting the stationary flagship.<ref name=m63/>

As the Japanese ships continued to pound the ''Tsesarevich'', the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Retvizan||2}} boldly charged T<U+014D>g<U+014D>'s battleline in an attempt to divert the Japanese shellfire, followed shortly afterward by ''Peresvet'', the flagship of the squadron's second-in-command, [[Rear Admiral]] Prince [[Pavel Ukhtomsky]]. The Japanese battleline immediately shifted fire to the oncoming ships, badly damaging both and forcing them to turn away.<ref name=m63>McLaughlin 2003, p. 163</ref> Ukhtomsky signaled the other Russian ships to follow him back to Port Arthur, but the signal was hard to discern because the flags had to be hung from the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] railings because ''Peresvet''{{'}}s topmasts had been shot away and were only gradually recognized.<ref name=m46>McLaughlin 2008, p. 46</ref> Although ''Pobeda'' was struck by eleven large-caliber hits that killed 4 men and wounded 29, including one below the waterline, they failed to penetrate her armor and she reached Port Arthur without any difficulties. The hits did, however, knock out one 10-inch gun and three 75-millimeter guns.<ref name=m88/>

===Siege of Port Arthur===
{{main|Siege of Port Arthur}}
[[File:Pallada and Pobeda.jpg|thumb|''Pobeda'' (right) and the protected cruiser {{ship|Russian cruiser|Pallada||2}} sunk in Port Arthur]]
Returning to Port Arthur on 11 August, the Russian squadron found the city still under siege by the [[Japanese Third Army]] led by [[Baron]] [[Nogi Maresuke]]. The new commander, Rear Admiral [[Robert N. Viren]], decided to use the men and guns of the Pacific Squadron to reinforce the defenses of Port Arthur and even more guns were stripped from the squadron's ships. This proved to make little difference and ''Pobeda'' was struck by several {{convert|5.9|in|adj=on}} and 4.7-inch shells on 28 September that did no significant damage. The Japanese bombardment with medium guns continued for the next month and a half and the ship was repeatedly struck, without much effect.<ref name=m88/> Japanese troops were able to seize [[203 Hill]] which overlooked the harbor on 5 December. This allowed the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]'s {{convert|28|cm|adj=on|sp=us}} siege guns to fire directly at the Russian ships; they hit ''Pobeda'' approximately 30 times and sank her in shallow water on 7 December 1904.<ref>McLaughlin 2003, pp. 115, 163<U+2013>64</ref> Russian attempts to destroy the ship before they surrendered were frustrated because her vital parts were already underwater.<ref name=m88/>

==Japanese career==
[[File:Suou1908Yokosuka.jpg|thumb|left|''Suwo'' at anchor in Yokosuka, 10 October 1908]]
''Pobeda'' was refloated by Japanese engineers on 17 October 1905 and was classified as a 1st-class battleship by the IJN. She was renamed as ''Suwo'' on 25 October,<ref name=l4>Lengerer, p. 44</ref> after the eponymous [[Suo Province|ancient province]].<ref name=s7>Silverstone, p. 337</ref> She steamed under her own power to Sasebo Naval Arsenal, where she arrived on 16 December and began temporary repairs. Her reconstruction at [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]] began in May 1906 and lasted until 10 October 1908.

To improve her stability, ''Suwo''{{'}}s forward [[Top (sailing ship)|fighting top]] was removed. The 6-inch bow gun was also removed and all of her light guns were replaced by 20 [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|QF 12-pounder 12 cwt]]<ref group=Note>"Cwt" is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.</ref> guns. Two above-water [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch]] torpedo tubes replaced her original torpedo armament and her crew now numbered 791 officers and enlisted men.<ref>Lengerer, pp. 43<U+2013>44</ref>

''Suwo'' was re-designated as a 1st class coastal defense ship on 28 August 1912 and became a training ship for cadets and engineers. Initially assigned to the 1st Standing Squadron when World War I began, she shortly afterwards became the flagship of the 2nd Squadron, commanded by Vice Admiral [[Kato Sadakichi]]. The squadron was tasked to blockade the German-owned port of [[Tsingtao]], China, and to cooperate with the Imperial Japanese Army in capturing the city. ''Tango'' and the other ships of the squadron, reinforced by the British pre-dreadnought {{HMS|Triumph|1903|6}}, bombarded German fortifications throughout the siege until the Germans surrendered on 7 November.<ref>McLaughlin 2008, p. 49; Stephenson, pp. 136, 162, 166</ref> ''Suwo'' served as flagship of the Second Squadron of the Second Fleet in 1915<U+2013>16 before becoming a gunnery training ship at Yokosuka for the rest of the war.<ref name=p6>Preston, p. 186</ref> In April 1922, in compliance with the Washington Naval Treaty, ''Suwo'' was disarmed at the [[Kure Naval Arsenal]].<ref name=j0>Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 20</ref> While her armor was being removed, the ship capsized on 13 July.<ref name=m5/> She was probably scrapped in 1922<U+2013>23, but at least one source suggests she was refloated and hulked, serving until being broken up at Kure in 1946.<ref name=j0/><ref>McLaughlin 2008, p. 49</ref>{{#tag:ref|She is not listed, however, in Fukui Shinzo's authoritative ''Japanese Naval Vessels at the End of World War II''.|group=Note}}
