'''Julius Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k''' ({{IPA-cs|<U+02C8>ju<U+02D0>l<U+026A>jus <U+02C8>fut<U+0283>i<U+02D0>k|lang}}) (23 February 1903 <U+2013> 8 September 1943) was a [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] journalist, an active member of [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] (Komunistick<U+00E1> strana <U+010C>eskoslovenska, KS<U+010C>), and part of the forefront of the anti-Nazi [[Widerstand|resistance]]. He was imprisoned, tortured, and executed by the [[Nazism|Nazis]].

The composer [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]] wrote a musical piece titled ''Julius Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k'' based on the journalist's diary ''Notes from the Gallows'' and meant it as a tribute to his resilience in the face of Nazi aggression.<ref>Marta, Nono's life, p.32</ref>

== Early life ==

Julius Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k was born into a working-class family in [[Prague]]. His father was a steelworker, and he was the nephew and namesake of the composer [[Julius Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k (composer) | Julius Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k]]. In 1913, Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k moved with his family from Prague to [[Plze<U+0148>]] (Pilsen) where he attended the state vocational high school. Already as a twelve-year-old boy he was planning to establish a newspaper named "''Slovan''" ("The Slav"). He showed himself to be interested in both politics and literature. As a teenager he frequently acted in local amateur theatre.

== Journalism and politics ==
In 1920 he took up study in Prague and joined the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Czechoslovak Social Democratic Workers' Party]], through which he was later to find himself swept up in the left-wing current. In May 1921 this wing founded the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (CPC). Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k then first wrote cultural contributions for the local Plze<U+0148> CPC newspaper.

After completing his studies, Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k found a position as an editor with the literary newspaper ''Kmen'' ("Stem"). Within the CPC he became responsible for cultural work. In the year 1929 he went to [[literary critic]] [[Franti<U+0161>ek Xaver <U+0160>alda]]'s magazine ''Tvorba'' ("Creation"). Moreover, he constantly worked on the CPC newspaper ''[[Rud<U+00E9> pr<U+00E1>vo]]'' ("Red Law") and several other journals. In this time Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k was arrested repeatedly by the Czechoslovakian Secret Police, managing to avoid an eight-month prison sentence in 1934.

In 1930, he visited the [[Soviet Union]] for four months, including the Czechoslovak [[collectivist]] colony [[Interhelpo]] in [[Central Asia]], and painted a very positive picture of the situation there in the book ''V zemi, kde z<U+00ED>tra ji<U+017E> znamen<U+00E1> v<U+010D>era'' ("In a Land, Where Tomorrow is Already Yesterday", published in 1932). In July 1934, just after [[Adolf Hitler]] had suppressed the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]], he visited [[Bavaria]] and described his experiences in ''Cesta do Mnichova'' ("The Road to [[Munich]]"). He went to the Soviet Union again in 1934, this time for two years, and wrote various reports, which again worked to support the Party's strength. After his return, there were heated arguments with authors such as [[Ji<U+0159><U+00ED> Weil]] and Jan Slav<U+00ED>k, who criticized developments under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k took the Stalinist side and criticized such statements critical of Stalin as fatal to the CPC.

In 1938 Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k married Augusta Kode<U+0159>i<U+010D>ov<U+00E1>, later known as [[Gusta Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>kov<U+00E1>]].

In the wake of the [[Munich Conference]], the Prague government disbanded the CPC from September 1938 and the CPC went underground. After [[Nazi Germany]]'s troops invaded Czechoslovakia in March 1939, Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k moved to his parents' house in [[Chotim<U+011B><U+0159>]] ([[Litom<U+011B><U+0159>ice|Litom<U+011B><U+0159>ice District]]) and published in civilian newspapers, especially about historical and literary topics. He also started to work for the now underground CPC. In 1940 the Gestapo started to search for him in Chotim<U+011B><U+0159> because of his cooperation with the CPC, and so he decided to move back to Prague.

Beginning early in 1941, he belonged to the CPC's Central Committee. He provided handbills and tried to publish the Communist Party newspaper ''Rud<U+00E9> Pr<U+00E1>vo'' regularly. On 24 April 1942 he and six others were arrested in Prague by the [[Gestapo]], probably rather coincidentally during a police raid. Although Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k had two guns at the time, he did not use them. The only survivor of the incident, Riva Friedov<U+00E1>-Krieglov<U+00E1>, claimed in the 1990s that Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k had had orders to shoot himself to avoid capture.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/czech/lupacr/79.shtml <U+00C8>esk<U+00E1> redakce | BBC World Service<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.bbc.co.uk</ref>

== ''Notes from the Gallows'' ==
[[File:notesfromthegallows.jpg|thumb||Julius Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k's ''Notes from the Gallows'' (first uncensored Czech edition, 1995)]]

First, Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k was detained in [[Pankr<U+00E1>c Prison]] in Prague where he was also interrogated and tortured. In this time arose Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k's ''Notes from the Gallows'' ({{lang-cs|Report<U+00E1><U+017E> psan<U+00E1> na opr<U+00E1>tce}}, literally ''Reports Written Under the Noose''), which was written on pieces of cigarette paper and smuggled out by sympathetic prison warders named Kol<U+00ED>nsk<U+00FD> and Hora. The book describes events in the prison since Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k's arrest and is filled with hope for a better, Communist future. In later years its authenticity was contested. The book was published in a more "acceptable" version, from which the less pleasant passages, which did not quite fit into everyone's picture of heroic resistance fighters, had been stricken.

== Trial and death ==
In May 1943 Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k was brought to Germany. He was first detained in [[Bautzen]] for somewhat more than two months, and afterwards in Berlin. On 25 August 1943 in Berlin, he was accused of [[high treason]] in connection with his political activities by the [[People's Court (Germany)|''Volksgerichtshof'']], which was presided over by the notorious [[Roland Freisler]]. Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k was found guilty and was sentenced to death along with Jaroslav Klecan, who had been arrested with Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k. Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k was hanged two weeks later on 8 September 1943 in [[Pl<U+00F6>tzensee Prison]] in Berlin (not beheaded as is often stated).

After the war, his wife, Gusta Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>kov<U+00E1>, who had also been in a Nazi [[concentration camp]], researched and retrieved all of his prison writings. She edited them with help of CPC and published them as ''Notes from the Gallows'' in 1947. The book was successful, and its influence increased after the Stalinist takeover of Czechoslovakia in 1948. It has been translated into at least 90 languages.

== Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k as an ideological symbol ==
The Party found Julius Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k and his book convenient for use as [[propaganda]] and turned them into one of the most visible symbols of the Party. The book was required reading in schools and by the age of 10 every pupil growing up in communist Czechoslovakia was familiar with Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k's work and life. Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k became a hero whose portrait was displayed at political meetings. Gusta Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>kov<U+00E1> was given a high position in the Party hierarchy (the chairmanship of a women's organization), holding it for decades.

Many places were named after Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k, among them a large entertainment park in Prague (''Park kultury a oddechu Julia Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>ka''), the city theatre in [[Jablonec nad Nisou]] (1945<U+2013>98), a factory in [[Brno]] (''Elektrotechnick<U+00E9> z<U+00E1>vody Julia Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>ka''), a military unit, and countless streets and squares.

The [[MV Yulius Fuchik|''Julius Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k'']]. (''<U+042E><U+043B><U+0438><U+0443><U+0441> <U+0424><U+0443><U+0447><U+0438><U+043A>'') was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and later [[Russia]]n [[barge carrier]]. In Tom Clancy's 1986 novel ''[[Red Storm Rising]]'', about a hypothetical war between the Warsaw Pact and NATO, this ship was given the role of being used for the Soviet invasion of Iceland.

== Reassessment ==
After the Party [[Velvet Revolution|lost its power in 1989]], the legend of Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k became a target of scrutiny. It was made public that some parts of the book ''Notes from the Gallows'' (around 2%) had been omitted and that the text had been "sanitized" by Gusta Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>kov<U+00E1>. There were speculations as to how much information he gave his torturers, and whether he had turned traitor. In 1995 the complete text of the book was published. The part in which Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k describes how he succumbed to torture was published for the first time. In it, one learns that Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k gave false information to his captors, saving countless lives among the Czech resistance to the Nazis. This publishing was a logical consequence of political changes, while Fu<U+010D><U+00ED>k's position as untouchable national hero was lost because of its incompatibility with the newly democratized Czech political atmosphere.

== Quotations ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
:"It so happens that killing a man is not the greatest evil that one can do that man. The Nazis were specialists, not only in murder and physical torture, but also in man's degradation and debasement, in the extermination of his hope, his attachment to life and his faculty of reasoning."

:"I would like people to know that there were no nameless heroes. That they were human beings who had their names, their faces, their longing, and their hopes, and that for that reason, even the pain of the last one among them was no less than the first one's pain, whose name remains. I would like them all to stay close to you always, like acquaintances, like kin, like you yourselves."

:"Mankind, we loved you <U+2014> be vigilant."
