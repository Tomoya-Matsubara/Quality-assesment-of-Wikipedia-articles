The '''goblin shark''' (''Mitsukurina owstoni'') is a rare, poorly known [[species]] of deep-sea [[shark]]. Sometimes called a "[[living fossil]]", it is the only extant representative of the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Mitsukurinidae''', a lineage some 125 million years old. This species looks unlike any other shark, with a long flattened snout, highly protrusible jaws containing prominent nail-like teeth, and pink coloration. It is usually between three and four meters (10<U+2013>13&nbsp;ft) long when mature, though can grow considerably larger. Goblin sharks inhabit upper [[continental slope]]s, [[submarine canyon]]s, and [[seamount]]s around the world at depths greater than {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with adults found deeper than juveniles.

Various anatomical features of the goblin shark, such as its flabby body and small fins, suggest that it is sluggish in nature. This species hunts for [[teleost]] fishes, [[cephalopod]]s, and [[crustacean]]s both near the [[sea floor]] and in the middle of the [[water column]]. Its long snout is covered with [[ampullae of Lorenzini]] that enable it to sense minute [[electric field]]s produced by nearby prey, which it can snatch up by rapidly extending its jaws. Small numbers of goblin sharks are [[bycatch|unintentionally caught]] by deepwater [[fisheries]]. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) has assessed it as [[Least Concern]], citing its wide distribution and low incidence of capture.

==Taxonomy==
[[File:Mitsu.JPG|thumb|left|Differing jaw positions in preserved goblin sharks led to several specimens being erroneously described as distinct species.]]
American [[ichthyologist]] [[David Starr Jordan]] described the goblin shark in an 1898 issue of ''[[Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences]]'', recognizing the peculiar fish not only as a new species but also a new [[genus]] and family. He based his account on an immature male {{convert|107|cm|in|abbr=on}} long caught in [[Sagami Bay]] near [[Yokohama]], Japan. The specimen had been acquired by [[shipmaster]] and [[naturalist]] [[Alan Owston]], who had given it to Professor Kachiki Mitsukuri at the [[University of Tokyo]], who in turn had brought it to Jordan. Thus, Jordan named the shark ''Mitsukurina owstoni'' in honor of these two men.<ref name="jordan"/> The [[common name]] "goblin shark" is a translation of its old Japanese name ''tenguzame'', a ''[[tengu]]'' being a Japanese mythical creature often depicted with a long nose and red face.<ref name="castro"/> Another name for this species is "elfin shark".<ref name="iucn"/>

Shortly after Jordan's description was published, several scientists noted the similarity between ''Mitsukurina'' and the extinct [[Mesozoic]] shark ''[[Scapanorhynchus]]''.<ref name="hussakof"/> For a time, the prevailing view was to treat ''Mitsukurina'' as a [[junior synonym]] of ''Scapanorhynchus''. Eventually, more complete [[fossil]]s revealed many anatomical differences between ''Scapanorhynchus'' and ''Mitsukurina'', leading modern authors to again regard them as distinct genera.<ref name="compagno"/> Several goblin shark specimens were described as separate species from 1904 to 1937, none of which are now considered valid. This [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] confusion arose because the specimens' jaws were fixed at varying degrees of protrusion during preservation, giving the appearance of proportional differences in the head.<ref name="martin"/>

==Phylogeny and evolution==
[[Phylogenetic]] studies based on [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] have generally placed the goblin shark as the most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] member of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Lamniformes]], known as mackerel sharks.<ref name="shirai"/><ref name="shimada"/> Studies using [[molecular phylogenetics|genetic data]] have also supported a basal position for this species.<ref name="naylor et al 1997"/><ref name="naylor et al 2012"/> The family Mitsukurinidae, represented by ''Mitsukurina'', ''Scapanorhynchus'', and ''[[Anomotodon]]'', dates back to the [[Aptian]] age of the [[Cretaceous]] period (''c.'' 125<U+2013>113 [[Ma (unit)|Ma]]). ''Mitsukurina'' itself first appears in the [[fossil record]] during the [[Middle Eocene]] (''c.'' 49<U+2013>37 Ma);<ref name="sepkoski"/><ref name="nelson"/> extinct species include ''[[Mitsukurina lineata|M. lineata]]'' and ''[[Mitsukurina maslinensis|M. maslinensis]]''.<ref name="vialle et al"/><ref name="pledge"/> ''[[Striatolamia macrota]]'', which lived in warm shallow waters during the [[Paleogene]] (''c.'' 66<U+2013>23 Ma), may also be a ''Mitsukurina'' species.<ref name="purdy"/> As the last member of an ancient lineage, and one that retains several "[[primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive]]" traits, the goblin shark has been described as a "[[living fossil]]".<ref name="birx"/>

==Description==
[[File:Mitsukurina owstoni.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Early illustration of a goblin shark; this species is usually depicted in art and photographs with its jaws extended, which in life only happens during feeding.]]
The goblin shark has a distinctively long and flattened snout, resembling a sword blade. The proportional length of the snout decreases with age.<ref name="parsons et al"/> The eyes are small and do not have protective [[nictitating membrane]]s; behind the eyes are [[spiracle]]s. The large mouth is [[parabola|parabolic]] in shape. The jaws are highly protrusible and can be extended almost to the end of the snout, though normally they are held flush against the underside of the head. There are 35<U+2013>53 upper and 31<U+2013>62 lower tooth rows. The teeth in the main part of the jaws are long and narrow, particularly those near the sympysis (jaw midpoint), and are finely grooved lengthwise. The rear teeth near the corners of the jaw are small and have a flattened shape for crushing. There is much among-individual variation in tooth length and width, in whether the teeth have a smaller cusplet on each side of the main [[cusp (dentistry)|cusp]], and in the presence of toothless gaps at the symphysis or between the main and rear teeth. The five pairs of [[gill slit]]s are short, with the [[gill filament]]s inside partly exposed; the fifth pair is above the origin of the [[pectoral fin]]s.<ref name="castro"/><ref name="compagno"/><ref name="last and stevens"/>

The body is fairly slender and flabby. The two [[dorsal fin]]s are similar in size and shape, both being small and rounded. The pectoral fins are also rather small and rounded. The [[pelvic fin|pelvic]] and [[anal fin]]s have long bases and are larger than the dorsal fins. The [[caudal peduncle]] is flattened from side-to-side and lacks keels or notches. The asymmetric [[caudal fin]] has a long upper lobe with a shallow ventral notch near the tip, and an indistinct lower lobe.<ref name="compagno"/><ref name="last and stevens"/> The soft, semi-translucent skin has a rough texture from a covering of [[dermal denticle]]s, each shaped like a short upright spine with lengthwise ridges. In life, this species is pink or tan due to visible [[blood vessel]]s beneath the skin; the color deepens with age, and young sharks may be almost white. The fins' margins are translucent gray or blue, and the eyes are black with bluish streaks in the [[iris (anatomy)|iris]]. After death, the coloration quickly fades to dull gray or brown.<ref name="castro"/><ref name="martin"/> Adult sharks usually measure between three and four meters (10<U+2013>13&nbsp;ft) long.<ref name="castro"/> However, the capture of an enormous female estimated at {{convert|5.4|-|6.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} long in 2000 showed that this species can grow far larger than previously suspected.<ref name="parsons et al"/> The maximum weight on record is {{convert|210|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for a {{convert|3.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} long shark.<ref name="compagno"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
The goblin shark has been caught in all three major oceans, indicating a wide global distribution. In the Atlantic Ocean, it has been recorded from the northern [[Gulf of Mexico]], Suriname, French Guiana, and southern Brazil in the west, and France, Portugal, [[Madeira]], and Senegal in the east.<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="castro"/><ref name="rincon et al"/> It has also been collected from [[seamount]]s along the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]].<ref name="kukuyev"/><ref name="prokofiev and kukuev"/> In the [[Indo-Pacific]] and [[Oceania]], it has been found off South Africa, Mozambique, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, and New Zealand. There is a single known eastern Pacific specimen, collected off southern [[California]].<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="castro"/> This species is most often found over the upper [[continental slope]] at depths of {{convert|270|-|960|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name="compagno"/> It has been caught as deep as {{convert|1300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and a tooth has been found lodged in an undersea cable at a depth of {{convert|1370|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name="martin2"/> Adults inhabit greater depths than juveniles. Immature goblin sharks frequent the [[submarine canyon]]s off southern Japan at depths of {{convert|100|-|350|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with individuals occasionally wandering into [[inshore]] waters as shallow as {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="ebert"/>

==Biology and ecology==
Although observations of living goblin sharks are scant, its anatomy suggests that it leads an inactive and sluggish lifestyle. Its skeleton is reduced and poorly [[calcification|calcified]], the muscle blocks along its sides ([[myomere]]s) are weakly developed, and its fins are soft and small. Its long caudal fin, held at a low angle, is also typical of a slow-swimming shark. The long snout appears to have a sensory function, as it bears numerous [[ampullae of Lorenzini]] that can [[electroreception|detect]] the weak [[electric field]]s produced by other animals. Due to the snout's lack of rigidity, it is unlikely to be used for stirring up prey from the bottom as has been proposed.<ref name="martin"/> Vision seems to be less important than other senses, considering the relatively small [[optic tectum]] in the shark's brain.<ref name="castro"/> Yet unlike most deep-sea sharks, it can change the size of its [[pupil]]s and thus probably does use its sight in some situations.<ref name="martin2"/> Goblin sharks may fall prey to the [[blue shark]] (''Prionace glauca'').<ref name="ebert"/> [[Parasite]]s documented from this species include the [[copepod]] ''[[Echthrogaleus mitsukurinae]]'',<ref name="izawa"/> and the [[tapeworm]]s ''[[Litobothrium amsichensis]]'' and ''[[Marsupiobothrium gobelinus]]''.<ref name="caira and runkle"/>

===Feeding===
[[File:CoryphaenoidesLeptolepis.jpg|thumb|Rattails and other deep-living teleosts are the main food of the goblin shark.]]
The goblin shark feeds mainly on [[teleost]] fishes such as [[rattail]]s and [[Stomiidae|dragonfishes]]. It also consumes [[cephalopod]]s and [[crustacean]]s, including [[Decapoda|decapods]] and [[isopod]]s. Garbage has been recorded from the stomachs of some specimens.<ref name="yano et al"/> Its known prey includes bottom-dwelling species such as the [[blackbelly rosefish]] (''Helicolenus dactylopterus''), and midwater species such as the [[squid]] ''[[Teuthowenia pellucida]]'' and the [[ostracod]] ''[[Macrocypridina castanea rotunda]]''. Thus, the goblin shark appears to forage for food both near the sea floor and far above it.<ref name="martin"/><ref name="duffy"/>

Since it is not a fast swimmer, the goblin shark may be an [[ambush predator]]. Its low-density flesh and large [[shark liver oil|oily]] [[liver]] make it [[neutral buoyancy|neutrally buoyant]], allowing it to drift towards its prey with minimal motions so as to avoid detection.<ref name="ebert"/> Once prey comes into range, the shark's specialized jaws can snap forward at incredible speed to capture it. The protrusion of the jaw is assisted by two pairs of elastic [[ligament]]s associated with the [[mandible|mandibular]] joint. The ligaments are pulled taut when the jaws are in their normal retracted position; as the shark bites, the ligaments release their tension and essentially "catapult" the jaws forward.<ref name="compagno"/> At the same time, the well-developed basihyal (analogous to a tongue) on the floor of the mouth shifts down, expanding the oral cavity and sucking in water and prey.<ref name="martin"/>

===Life history===
Little is known about goblin shark reproduction, as a pregnant female has yet to be found and studied. It likely shares the reproductive characteristics of other mackerel sharks, which are [[viviparous]] with small litter sizes and [[embryo]]s that grow during [[gestation]] by eating undeveloped [[ovum|eggs]] ([[oophagy]]).<ref name="iucn"/> The birth size is probably close to {{convert|82|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the length of the smallest known specimen.<ref name="castro"/> Males [[mature sexually]] at around {{convert|2.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, while female maturation size is unknown.<ref name="iucn"/> No data are available on growth and aging.<ref name="castro"/>

==Human interactions==
Given the depths at which it lives, the goblin shark poses no danger to humans. A few specimens have been collected alive and brought to [[public aquarium]]s, though they survived only a short time. One was kept at [[Tokai University]] and lived for a week, while another was kept at Tokyo Sea Life Park and lived for two days.<ref name="compagno"/><ref name="tzn"/> Its economic significance is minimal; the meat may be dried and salted, while the jaws fetch high prices from collectors.<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="compagno"/> At one time, the Japanese also used it for liver oil and [[fertilizer]].<ref name="bean"/> This shark is not targeted by any [[fisheries]], but is occasionally found as [[bycatch]] in bottom [[gillnet]]s and [[trawl]]s, hooked on [[longline fishing|longlines]], or entangled in fishing gear. Most captures are isolated incidents; one of the few areas where it is caught regularly is off southern Japan, where around thirty individuals (mostly juveniles) are taken each year. The [[black scabbardfish]] (''Aphanops carbo'') fishery off Madeira also takes two or three goblin sharks annually. In April 2003, over a hundred goblin sharks were caught off northwestern Taiwan; the cause of the event was unknown, though observers noted that it was preceded by a major [[earthquake]]. The species had never been recorded in the area before, nor has it been found in such numbers since.<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="castro"/> The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) has listed the goblin shark under [[Least Concern]]. In addition to its wide range, most of its population is thought to reside in unfished environments because few adults are caught. Therefore, it is not believed to be threatened by human activity.<ref name="iucn"/>
