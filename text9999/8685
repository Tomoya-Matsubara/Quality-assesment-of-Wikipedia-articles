The '''First Hungarian Reformed Church of New York''' ({{lang-hu|New York-i Els<U+0151> Magyar Reform<U+00E1>tus Egyh<U+00E1>z}}) is located on East 69th Street in the [[Upper East Side]] of the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]]. It is a [[stucco]]-faced brick building completed in 1916 in a Hungarian [[vernacular architecture|vernacular]] [[architectural style]], housing a congregation established in 1895.

It is the only Christian religious building designed by Hungarian-born architect [[Emery Roth]], later known for his apartment buildings on [[Central Park West]].<ref name="NRHP nom" /> As one of two [[Reformed Church in Hungary|Hungarian Reformed Churches]] in Manhattan, it has a been a focal point for the city's [[Hungarian-American]] community since its construction. 

In 1983, its [[parsonage]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as a [[contributing property]] to the [[Rowhouses at 322<U+2013>344 East 69th Street]] [[historic district (United States)|historic district]] to its immediate west. The parsonage was listed in its own right along with the church in 2000. Following the demolition of the German Evangelical Reformed Church a block to the south, it is now the oldest church in neighborhood.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

==Buildings==
The church is located on the south side of the street midway between [[First Avenue (Manhattan)|First]] and [[Second Avenue (Manhattan)|Second]] avenues. It is in the middle of a group of old [[rowhouse]]s. [[Rowhouses at 322<U+2013>344 East 69th Street|Those on the west]] are among the few remaining from the early development of this part of the Upper East Side around 1880. The rowhouse on the church's west serves as its [[parsonage]]. Across the street are larger, taller apartment buildings dating to the first half of the 20th century. Similar high-rises are to the south.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

The building itself is a two-story, three-[[bay (architecture)|bay]] structure with raised basement in brick faced with yellow [[stucco]]. A square [[bell tower]] rises from the center of a side-[[gable]]d roof; behind it the roof is flat. There is a slightly projecting main entrance at the center and a basement entrance on the west.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

On the north-facing street [[facade]]'s first floor are two windows on either side of the main entrance with piers on either side. They are topped with decorative ceramic rectangular panels. Above them, on the second story, are double windows topped with similarly decorated semicircular panels. In the middle, on the projecting section, is a large [[oculus]] with plaster surround.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

The roofline is marked by a [[bracket (architecture)|bracketed]] overhanging [[eave]] with exposed [[rafter]] tails. Above it the bell tower rises, with a single narrow window on the north above the roof topped by three similar windows on each face at the top. Each corner is topped with pyramid-shaped pinnacles; the tower itself has a conical roof in red tile with a [[weathervane]] on top.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

A pent roof with wooden knee braces, below another rectangular ceramic panel, shelters the main entrance. Below it are double wooden doors beneath a [[stained glass]] tripartite [[transom (architectural)|transom]] with an eagle in the center. It opens into a [[vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]] with steps leading into the [[nave]].<ref name="NRHP nom" />

The nave has a mosaic tile floor with [[Meander (art)|Greek key]] border and marble [[wainscoting]]. A central aisle runs between two rows of original wooden [[pew]]s. Full-height [[pilaster]]s divide the walls into four bays. At the south end the walls are angled and filled with stained glass windows topped with a semicircular arch. A [[columbarium]] with bronze font is in the northeast corner.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

Heating ducts are visible along the top of the west wall. The [[coffer]]ed ceiling is elliptical-arched with lateral beams springing from the pilaster [[capital (architecture)|capitals]]. The coffers themselves are intricately painted and [[gilding|gilded]]. In the center of the ceiling are stained glass skylights. The light they let in is supplemented by artificial light from hanging fixtures.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

A stairwell in the northwest corner of the vestibule leads to the [[choir loft]]. It has [[marquetry]] panels with Hungarian folk art motifs below the [[balustrade]]. The church's basement has been remodeled into an auditorium with paneled walls and a dropped acoustic-tile ceiling. A door near the rear of the nave opens into the parsonage.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

The parsonage is a three-story [[Neo-Grec]] [[brownstone]] [[rowhouse]] with raised basement and [[Stoop (architecture)|stoop]]. Like the others in the row, it has decorated door and window enframements, [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] stones and a segmental arch window on the basement and a [[galvanization|galvanized]] iron [[cornice]] with decorative brackets at the flat roof. Inside many original finishes remain, such as paneled doors, stair balustrade and high ceilings. The first floor is the church office, with the upper stories the living space.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

==History==

After the failure of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|1848 revolt]] against [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg rule]], [[Forty-Eighters#Forty-Eighters in the U.S.|Hungarian refugees]] began settling in New York. They started ''Magyar Szamuzottek'' ("Hungarian Exiles' News"), the first [[Hungarian American]] newspaper. The community grew again in the 1880s when immigrants began coming to America for better economic opportunities. Most settled along [[Second Avenue (Manhattan)|Second Avenue]], either between [[1st Street (Manhattan)|1st]] and [[10th Street (Manhattan)|10th]] streets or [[55th Street (Manhattan)|55th]] and [[72nd Street (Manhattan)|72nd]].<ref name="NRHP nom" />

In 1895 The Rev. Bertalan Demeter established the First Hungarian Congregation, holding services in the Hope Chapel on 4th Street. Three years afterwards, in 1889, a new pastor, Zoltan Kuthy, led the congregation into joining the [[Reformed Church in Hungary|Hungarian Reformed church]]es that had already been established elsewhere in the U.S. The church grew, and bought a house on East 7th Street for services.

The [[United States census, 1910|1910 census]] indicated that over 75,000 New Yorkers identified as of Hungarian origin. Most were from the regions of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] that, in addition to modern Hungary, include portions of the [[Czech Republic]], [[Austria]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]]. Ethnically some were [[Romanian people|Romanian]], [[Slovak people|Slovak]] and [[Croatian people|Croatian]]. They were of diverse religious background, most [[Catholicism in Hungary|Roman Catholic]] or [[Eastern Orthodox]], but with significant [[Protestant]]s and [[Hungarian Jews|Jewish]] populations.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

In 1914 the church sold its house and bought the three lots on East 69th Street. Two of the existing houses were demolished to clear a site for the church; the one that remained was renovated for use as a parsonage. [[Emery Roth]], a Hungarian immigrant from [[Se<U+010D>ovce|G<U+00E1>lsz<U+00E9>cs]], was retained to design the new building. It was only his second religious building, and the only Christian building ever for Roth, who designed several [[synagogue]]s in the city. Since he was Jewish, it is likely that he was chosen for his familiarity with Hungarian [[vernacular architecture]] and close ties with the Hungarian community.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

Roth's design reflects many Hungarian church building traditions, in keeping with the practice of many immigrant communities of the time. The stucco exterior is accented with inlaid [[faience]] tile, overhanging roof with rafter tails, and clay-tiled conical tower. Inside, the [[coffer]]ed ceiling is a common element in churches in eastern Hungary and [[Transylvania]]. Its 322 individual coffers are handpainted with Hungarian folk motifs. It has been called "a charmingly exotic adapation of Hungarian vernacular architecture".<ref name="NRHP nom" />

The new building was [[consecration|consecrated]] in early 1916, using the bell from the old church. Since then there have been few changes other than the remodeling of the parsonage. The [[columbarium]] was added to the nave in the 1950s, and the basement was remodeled at some point. Old photographs also show all roofs having the same clay tiles as the tower.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

New York's Hungarian community reached its zenith of almost 125,000 in the middle of the 20th century, the largest of any city in the nation. The area around the church had a strong Hungarian presence, with many bookstores and restaurants catering to its tastes. It declined over the rest of the century as the descendants of the original immigrants gradually [[assimilation (sociology)|assimilated]] and moved to [[Queens]] or the suburbs.<ref name="NYT story">{{cite news|last=Berger|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Berger (author)|title=On the Upper East Side, Memories Fueled by Strudel
