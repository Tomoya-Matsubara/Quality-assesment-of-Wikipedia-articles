{{Quote|Whatever righteous cause the Jewish victims of the 1930s<U+2013>40s Nazi Holocaust had, (probably minuscule, compared to the Jewish Holocausts against Middle Passage Blacks, African Americans and Christians<U+2014>including the bloody persecution of Westboro Baptist Church by Topeka Jews in the 1990s), has been drowned in sodomite semen. American taxpayers are financing this unholy monument to Jewish mendacity and greed and to filthy fag lust. Homosexuals and Jews dominated Nazi Germany ... The Jews now wander the earth despised, smitten with moral and spiritual blindness by a divine judicial stroke ... And God has smitten Jews with a certain unique madness ... Jews, thus perverted, out of all proportion to their numbers energize the militant sodomite agenda... Jews are the real Nazis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/wbc/wbc_on_jews.asp|title=Extremism in America:Westboro Baptist Church In Their Own Words: On Jews |publisher=The Anti-Defamation League}}</ref>}}

WBC was present at a 2002 Holocaust memorial dedication in Topeka, proclaiming "God Hates [[Reform Judaism]]".<ref>[http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/may2002/Holocaust_5-11-2002.pdf Flier from God Hates Fags (PDF)]</ref>

On May 8, 2009, members of the church protested at three Jewish sites in Washington, D.C., including the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) offices, the [[U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum]] and the city's largest synagogue. Margie Phelps, daughter of Pastor [[Fred Phelps]], led the protest, holding signs stating that "God Hates Israel", "Jews Killed Jesus", "America Is Doomed", "Israel Is Doomed", and "ADL Jew Bullies". The protest was apparently part of a series of upcoming protests which the church has planned at Jewish institutions in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], South Florida and [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]. The group reportedly posted a list of the upcoming protests' locations and dates, along with the statement "Jews Killed the Lord Jesus."<ref name=JTA1>[http://jta.org/news/article/2009/05/12/1005095/militant-anti-gay-church-turns-its-sights-on-jews Militant anti-gay church turns its sights on Jews] by Eric Fingerhut, Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), May 12, 2009.</ref>

In an interview, Margie Phelps said that her church was targeting the [[American Jews|American Jewish community]] because church members had "testified" to gentiles for 19&nbsp;years that "America is doomed" and that "Now it's too late. We're done with them." Phelps also claimed Jews were "one of the loudest voices" in favor of [[homosexuality]] and [[abortion]] and that "[Jews] claim to be God's chosen people. Do you think that God is going to wink at that forever?" Phelps concluded by stating, in an apparent reference to the [[Book of Revelation]], that all the nations of the world would soon march on [[Israel]], and that they would be led by President [[Barack Obama]], whom she called the "[[Antichrist]]".<ref name=JTA1/>

===Other protest activities===

On January 26, 2008, WBC traveled to [[Jacksonville, North Carolina]], home of [[Camp Lejeune]], to protest the [[United States Marine Corps]] in the wake of the murder of [[Maria Lauterbach]]. Five women protested, stomping on the American flag and shouting slogans such as "1,2,3,4, God Hates the Marine Corps". A group of over 40 counter-protesters arrived and one spat in [[Shirley Phelps-Roper]]'s face.<ref>Gale, Heather (January 26, 2008), [http://www.jdnews.com/news/church_54654___article.html/military_flag.html "Church group draws counterprotest"], [[Jacksonville Daily News|''Jacksonville'' (NC) ''Daily News'']], retrieved June 14, 2011</ref> Another counter-protest was held across town, which attracted over 150 counterprotesters.

11-year-old brain tumor victim, Harry Moseley raised <U+00A3>500,000 for charity but Marge Phelps of the Westboro Baptist Church criticized his family for not teaching him to "obey God".

==Church views==
[[File:WBC protest.jpg|right|thumb|A WBC member and child protesting homosexuality at the Trinity Episcopal Church in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]]]
The Westboro Baptist Church considers membership in most religious groups, such as the [[Roman Catholic Church]] or [[Islam]], as akin to [[Theistic Satanism|devil worship]], and states these other churches to be "Satanic frauds preaching [[Arminianism|Arminian]] lies".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.godhatesfags.com/written/wbcinfo/memoonthechurch.pdf |title=Memo on the Church | accessdate=March 21, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080602211609/http://www.godhatesfags.com/written/wbcinfo/memoonthechurch.pdf |archivedate = June 2, 2008}}</ref> All non-Christian entities, non-Protestant Christian churches, and all Protestant Christian churches that do not strongly condemn homosexuality are said to be sending their members to Hell.

===Purpose of protests and church actions===

In the BBC documentary ''[[The Most Hated Family in America]]'', filmmaker Louis Theroux questioned Shirley Phelps-Roper as to whether she had considered that Westboro's technique of protests were more likely to "put people ''off'' the Word of Jesus Christ and the Bible".

In response, Phelps-Roper said as to the purpose of the protests, "''You'' think our job is to win souls to Christ. All we do, by getting in their face and putting these signs in front of them and these plain words, is make what's already in their heart come out of their mouth."<ref name="bbc-doc">{{Cite video | people = Theroux, Louis | title = The Most Hated Family in America  | url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1000764/ | medium = Television documentary | publisher = BBC | date = 2007 }}</ref>

Later in the documentary, Phelps-Roper agrees that the $200,000 the church annually spends to fly to funerals to protest was money spent to spread "God's hate".<ref name="bbc-doc"/>

===Views on homosexuality===
The church runs numerous Web sites such as GodHatesFags.com, GodHatesAmerica.com and others expressing condemnation of [[homosexuality]].

The group bases its work around the belief expressed by its best known slogan and the address of its primary Web site, God Hates Fags, asserting that every tragedy in the world is linked to homosexuality<U+2014>specifically society's increasing tolerance and acceptance of the so-called [[homosexual agenda]]. The group maintains that God hates gays above all other kinds of "sinners"<ref name="wbc-faq">[http://www.godhatesfags.com/faq.html#Focus "Westboro Baptist Church FAQ"].</ref> and that homosexuality should be a [[capital punishment|capital crime]].<ref>[http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/dec2002/Outlaw_Sodomy_12-3-2002.pdf "Outlaw Sodomy"], December 3, 2002</ref>

Their views on homosexuality are partially based on teachings found in the Old Testament, specifically Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13, which they interpret to mean that homosexual behavior is detestable, and that homosexuals should be put to death, respectively.<ref name="wbc-faq"/>

===Views on religions===
====Catholicism====
Westboro Baptist refers to Catholic priests as "[[vampire]]s" and "[[Dracula]]s" and talks of Catholic priests sucking semen out of male children's genitals like vampires suck blood from their victims. In addition, WBC calls [[Pope Benedict XVI]] such [[epithet]]s as "The Godfather of [[pedophilia|Pedophile]]s" and "Pervert Pope". In April 2008 the WBC protested Pope Benedict XVI during a papal visit in [[New York City]].

[[Image:Westboro Baptist Church in New York by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|WBC member protesting [[Pope Benedict XVI]] outside the [[United Nations]] in [[New York City]] (2008).]] The WBC launched a website called Priests Rape Boys in which they criticize the [[Roman Catholic Church]] because of the [[Catholic sex abuse cases|Catholic sex abuse scandal]], saying, "Every time any person gives any amount of money to the Catholic Church, that person is paying the salary of pedophile rapists."<ref name=Parishioners>{{cite web|url=http://www.priestsrapeboys.com/parishioners.html |title=Parishioners page at Priests Rape Boys |publisher=Priests Rape Boys|date= |accessdate=2011-08-30}}</ref>

The WBC describes the Roman Catholic Church as, "the largest, most well-funded and organized pedophile group in the history of man"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.priestsrapeboys.com/ |title=Priests Rape Boys |publisher=Priests Rape Boys |date= |accessdate=2011-08-30}}</ref> and goes on to say that, "There are over 1&nbsp;billion Catholics in the world<U+2014>that's one out of every six people alive today<U+2014>and every single one of them will split Hell wide open when they die<U+2014>period. And there is nothing they can do about it."<ref name=Parishioners/>

The WBC also criticizes Catholicism, as it does Eastern Orthodoxy, for [[veneration|venerating]] the [[Virgin Mary]], the [[Saints]], [[relics]], and [[icons]]; accusing the Catholic Church of committing [[idolatry]].

==== Protestantism ====
Though the main purpose of the Priests Rape Boys website is to criticize Catholicism, the WBC also criticizes several mainline [[Protestant]] churches on the website, including [[Methodists]], [[Presbyterians]], [[Lutherans]], [[Anglicans]], and [[Baptists]]. The WBC states that

{{quote|...their preachers have shirked their responsibility to tell people the truth about sin, and instead lie to them about what the Lord their God doth require of them. If these lying, false prophets told people the truth about what God says regarding those who suffer sin upon their neighbor (Lev. 19:17<U+2013>18), there wouldn't be any butts in the seats when the plate got passed. These preachers are not preachers of righteousness, they are teachers having [[itching ears]] (2Tim 4:3), and they absolutely count on the abysmal bible illiteracy of their parishioners ... "Priests rape boys" is indeed an air-tight, three word case against all of the mainline "christian" churches <U+2013> their preachers and members, without exception. They are all going to Hell!<ref>[http://www.priestsrapeboys.com/otherchurches.html "Other Christian 'Churches' have gone ''awhoring'' after strange gods"], PriestsRapeBoys.com</ref>}}

==== Eastern Orthodoxy ====
The WBC claims that [[Orthodox Christians]] are indistinguishable from [[Roman Catholics]]. The WBC criticizes the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]'s use of [[Eastern Orthodox icons|icons]], claiming that they constitute [[idolatry]]. The WBC also criticizes veneration of the [[Virgin Mary]], the [[Theotokos]], saying, "There is no scripture that supports bowing down to kiss images ... or praying to Mary! She was a human being, who God predestinated to bring forth the Lord Jesus Christ, and to raise him."<ref>[http://www.godhatestheworld.com/russia/falsereligion.html "Russia's False Religious Systems"], ''God Hates Russia'', retrieved July 1, 2011</ref>

==== Islam ====
In response to a ''[[Newsweek]]'' article alleging that American soldiers flushed copies of the [[Qur'an]] down the toilet at [[Camp X-Ray]] in [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantanamo Bay]], Fred Phelps released this statement:<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20050525085556/http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/may2005/20050519_week-726.pdf "Statement from God Hates Fags"]</ref>
{{Quote|So what if our guys flushed copies of the Quran down the toilet? We hope they did. They probably did; We hope they flush more. Mohammed was a demon-possessed whoremonger and pedophile who contrived a 300-page work of Satanic fiction: The Quran! Like America's own whoremonger and pedophile wangled his own hokey [[Book of Mormon]]!}}

In relation to the war in Iraq, a WBC flier says "America bombed our church with an IED made by fag students... In His retaliatory rage God is killing Americans with Muslim IEDs: 'Saying, Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm.' 1 Chron 16:22."<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070630110558/http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/mar2007/20070318_angel-rosa-funeral.pdf Flyer from God Hates Fags]</ref>

==== Hinduism ====
The WBC maintains a ''God Hates India'' webpage where they state that "80% of [[India]]'s population claim to practice [[Hinduism]] ... "A country full of idolatry inevitably results in a nation full of fags and fag-enablers, because that's what happens when you depart from the Living God!"<ref name="godhatestheworld.com">[http://www.godhatestheworld.com/india/falsereligion.html "India's False Religious Systems"], ''God Hates India'', retrieved July 1, 2011</ref>

The WBC then admonishes [[Hindus]] to convert to Christianity saying: "If you would STOP worshipping false gods, being a fag would not be a complex matter. Stop going a whoring after other gods and start serving the Living God in truth!"<ref name="godhatestheworld.com"/>

==== Judaism ====
In the section about [[Jew]]s, the WBC FAQ states:

{{Quote|The only true Jews are Christians. The rest of the people who claim to be Jews aren't, and they are nothing more than typical, impenitent sinners ... the vast majority of Jews support fags. In fact, it is the official policy of Reformed Jews to support same-sex marriage. Of course, there are Jews who still believe God's law, but most of them have even departed from that. It doesn't matter if you're a Jew or a Gentile...as long as you believe in Christ.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.godhatesfags.com/main/faq.html#Jews|title=Westboro Baptist Church FAQ: What do you think of Jews?|accessdate=2006-12-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061117034635/http://www.godhatesfags.com/main/faq.html#Jews <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-11-17}}</ref>}}

In 1996, Phelps began a campaign called "Topeka's Baptist Holocaust", whereby he attempted to draw attention to attacks perpetrated against WBC picketers, saying that they were not random but organized attacks orchestrated by Jews and homosexuals. Phelps announced, "Jews killed Christ", and "Fag Jew Nazis are worse than ordinary Nazis. They've had more experience. The First Holocaust was a Jewish Holocaust against Christians. The latest Holocaust is by Topeka Jews against Westboro Baptist Church."<ref name=ADLITOW />

In another statement, he said "Topeka Jews today stir up Kansas tyrants in persecuting Westboro Baptists.

=== Laws limiting funeral protests ===
In response to the protests conducted by Westboro members at [[Indiana]] funerals, a bill was introduced in the [[Indiana General Assembly]] that would make it a [[felony]] to protest within  {{convert|500|ft|m}} of a [[funeral]]. The bill provides penalties of up to three years in prison and a $10,000 fine for those found to be in violation of the law. Shortly before this bill was signed members of the church had threatened to protest in [[Kokomo, Indiana]], at a funeral service that was being held for a soldier who was killed in Iraq. On January 11, 2006, the bill unanimously (11<U+2013>0) passed a committee vote,<ref>[http://www.wndu.com/news/012006/news_47194.php "Funeral protest bill passes out of committee, 11-0"]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref> and while members of the church had traveled to Kokomo to protest, they were not seen during or after the funeral service. On May 23, 2006, the state of [[Michigan]] banned any intentional disruption of funerals within {{convert|500|ft|m}} of the ceremony. Violating the statute would be a felony, punishable by up to two years in prison and a $5,000 fine for the first offense and up to four years in prison and a $10,000 fine for a subsequent offense.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060723211636/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=16931 firstamendmentcenter.org: news]</ref>

On May 17, 2006, the state of [[Illinois]] enacted Senate Bill 1144, the "Let Them Rest In Peace Act", to shield grieving military families from protests during funerals and memorial services of fallen military service members. A first-time violation of the Act is a Class C misdemeanor, punishable by up to 30&nbsp;days in jail and a $1,500 fine and a Class 4 felony for a second or subsequent offense, which is punishable by one to three years in state prison and a fine of up to $25,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.illinois.gov/PressReleases/ShowPressRelease.cfm?SubjectID=1&RecNum=4891 |title=Gov.

Bennett]] stated that the First Amendment protection of free speech has limits, including vulgar, offensive and shocking statements, and that the jury must decide "whether the defendant's actions would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, whether they were extreme and outrageous and whether these actions were so offensive and shocking as to not be entitled to First Amendment protection".<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,305279,00.html "Father of Marine Killed in Iraq Sues Church for Cheering Death, Appeals to Public Online for Help"], ''[[Fox News]]'', October 26, 2007</ref> See also [[Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire]], a case where certain personal slurs and obscene utterances by an individual were found unworthy of First Amendment protection, due to the potential for violence resulting from their utterance.

On October 31, 2007, WBC, [[Fred Phelps]] and his two daughters, [[Shirley Phelps-Roper]] and Rebecca Phelps-Davis, were found liable for invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. A federal jury awarded Snyder $2.9&nbsp;million in compensatory damages, then later added a decision to award $6&nbsp;million in punitive damages for invasion of privacy and an additional $2&nbsp;million for causing emotional distress (a total of $10,900,000). The organization said it would not change its message because of the verdict.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21566280/ "Father wins millions from war funeral picketers"], ''[[msnbc.com]]'', October 31, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN3134225120071031 "Kansas church liable in Marine funeral protest"], ''[[Reuters]]'', October 31, 2007]</ref><ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/10/31/funeral.protest/?iref=mpstoryview "Church ordered to pay $10.9 million for funeral protest"], ''[[CNN]]'', October 31, 2007</ref>

On September 24, 2009, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of Westboro Baptist Church and reversed the lower court's award. It found their picket near the funeral is protected speech because it involves "matters of public concern, including the issues of homosexuals in the military, the sex-abuse scandal within the Catholic Church, and the political and moral conduct of the United States and its citizens", and did not violate the privacy of the service member's family.<ref>[http://www.military.com/news/article/court-says-gi-funeral-protests-legal.html?col=1186032310810 "Court Says GI Funeral Protests Legal"], ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', September 25, 2009]</ref> On March 30, 2010, the appeals court ordered Albert Snyder to pay the church's court costs of over $16,000, a move that Snyder's attorney's referred to as "adding insult to injury".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/carroll/bal-protest0329,0,3866909.story |title=Marine's father ordered to pay Westboro's court costs |work=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=April 19, 2010}}</ref> The decision has led to nationwide support for Snyder, with over 3,000 promises for donations to help offset the cost; [[Pundit (expert)|political commentator]] [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] offered to pay the entire amount of the costs on March 30.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/03/31/2010-03-31_bill_oreilly_helps_albert_snyder_after_weird_westboro_baptist_church_protests_hi.html |title=Support grows for dad of slain Marine told to pay Westboro Baptist Church, which cheered son's death |work=Daily News|date=March 31, 2010 |accessdate=April 5, 2010 | location=New York | first=Adam | last=Sommers}}</ref><ref name="MCT">{{cite web|url=http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2010/04/marine_scotus_040510w/|title=Snyder-Phelps fight has many twists, turns|last=Lamothe|first=Dan|date=April 6, 2010|work=[[Marine Corps Times]]|accessdate=April 6, 2010}}</ref> The American Legion has also raised $17,000 to help pay Snyder's court costs.<ref>{{Cite document|title=Snyder donations exceed $17,000|url=http://www.legion.org/news/10641/snyder-donations-exceed-17000|date=April 5, 2010|publisher=[[American Legion]]|accessdate=April 19, 2010}}</ref>

On March 8, 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] in ''Snyder v.

In an 8<U+2013>1 decision, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Phelps on March 2, 2011. Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] wrote the majority opinion stating: "What Westboro said, in the whole context of how and where it chose to say it, is entitled to 'special protection' under the First Amendment and that protection cannot be overcome by a jury finding that the picketing was outrageous."<ref name=Ruling.>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=High court rules for military funeral protesters|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hnPWL4coVAdgWO3Ag0xAiUw7OelQ?docId=e6ef115dd3ed41b4887feb61a2082af7|accessdate=March 2, 2011|newspaper=Google News}}</ref>
Justice [[Samuel Alito]], the lone dissenter, said Snyder wanted only to "bury his son in peace". Instead, Alito said, the protesters "brutally attacked" Matthew Snyder to attract public attention. "Our profound national commitment to free and open debate is not a license for the vicious verbal assault that occurred in this case," he said.

===Other legal responses===
On July 14, 2006, [[Mundy Township, Michigan]] billed the WBC for $5,000. The Westboro church had informed township authorities on June 28 that a protest was planned at the Swartz Funeral Home. The bill to the church ensued, according to the local police chief, because the congregation failed to keep a verbal contract for security. Fred Phelps' daughter claimed that the Holy Ghost had informed them not to fly to Michigan even though they had already purchased airline tickets. Security at the Webb funeral was high; 15 fire trucks were involved, as well as numerous police officers from nearby jurisdictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pridesource.com/article.shtml?article=19573 |title=Michigan town bills Phelps' church over protest no-show |publisher=Pridesource.com |date=2006-07-20 |accessdate=2011-08-30}}</ref> The township has now stated that it will not pursue the matter.

===Parodies===
{{anchor|God hates figs}}
A slogan commonly invoked at the counter protests is "God hates figs". Parodying the WBC all-capitals "God hates fags" signs, the counter-protest signs often invoke a passage in the [[Bible|Biblical]] book of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] to justify the claim about God and his feelings about [[Common fig|fig]]s.  The signs have been noted at counter-protests at the University of Chicago;<ref>{{cite web|last=Christman |first=Zach |url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Students-Counter-Protest-Westboro-Baptist-Church-at-University-of-Chicago-UIC-God-Hates-Figs-and-Shrimp.html |title=God Hates Figs (and Shrimp) |publisher=NBC Chicago |date=2009-03-13 |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref> in Spartanburg, South Carolina;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goupstate.com/article/20110215/ARTICLES/102151024/1088/sports?Title=Kansas-church-a-no-show-at-Converse-but-film-draws-a-crowd |title=Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kan., a no-show at Converse |publisher=GoUpstate.com |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref> and in Portsmouth, New Hampshire,<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeann<U+00E9> McCartin |url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20110224-NEWS-102240415 |title=Hundreds speak out against hate in city |publisher=SeacoastOnline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref> as well as at the non-WBC-themed [[Rally to Restore Sanity]].<ref name="huffingtonpost1">{{cite web|author=Kent Hayden |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kent-hayden-mdiv/the-religion-of-a-satiric_b_777097.html |title=The Religion of a Satirical Generation |work=The Huffington Post |date= |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref> The use of the signs has been invoked as a sign of sanity by the ACLU<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aclu.org/2009/03/16/god-hates-figs |title=God Hates Figs |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |date= |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref> and others.<ref name="huffingtonpost1"/>

Documentation given out at various counter-protests cite biblical verses<ref>{{cite web|last=Savage |first=Dan |url=http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2009/03/12/god_hates_figs |title=God Hates Figs |publisher=The Stranger (Seattle) |date=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref> in which [[Jesus]] says that none should eat the fruit of a fig tree ({{Bibleverse||Mark|11:12-14|NIV}}), in which [[Cursing the fig tree|Jesus causes a fig tree to wither]] ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|21:18-20|NIV}}), and in which God promises, as a punishment, to make someone like bad figs ({{Bibleverse||Jeremiah|29:17|NIV}}). These are genuine citations, but are not the sole mentions of [[figs in the Bible]].

Other sites and organization have parodied the slogans of the Westboro Baptist Church, including [http://www.godhatesfredphelps.com/ God Hates Fred Phelps], [http://godhatesbags.com/ God Hates Bags], and [http://www.godhatesshrimp.com/ God Hates Shrimp].

===Criticism===
A number of Phelps' critics have suggested that the actions of the Westboro Baptist Church are a ploy to receive attention above all else. Counter-protesting against the group, they suggest, gives them attention and incentive that they do not deserve; and a more effective response against Phelps would be to ignore his congregation completely.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/media/pdf/Responding-to-the-Westboro-Baptist-Church.pdf |title=Responding to the Westboro Baptist Church |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |accessdate=2010-01-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/authorities-eye-kansas-hate-group-s-visit-to-li-1.1465453 |first=Bart|last=Jones |title=Authorities eye Kansas hate group's visit to LI |work=[[Newsday]] |date=September 21, 2009 |accessdate=2010-01-30 }} (subscription required for full article)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.modemac.com/wiki/Westboro_Baptist_Church|title=The High Weirdness Project: Westboro Baptist Church|accessdate=2006-12-02|date=2006-11-03}}</ref> WBC, through the closely related Phelps Chartered law firm, has collected fees under the [[Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act of 1976]] when their protests have been unlawfully disrupted.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20060118030042/http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/jan2006/20060114_pandering-demagogic-legislatures.pdf</ref>

==Documentary media coverage==
In 2001, [[Sundance Channel (United States)|Sundance Channel]] aired the film ''[[A Union in Wait]]'', a documentary about [[same-sex marriage]] directed by [[Ryan Butler]]. Phelps and members of Westboro Baptist Church appeared in the film after Phelps picketed [[Wake Forest Baptist Church]] at [[Wake Forest University]] over a proposed same-sex union ceremony.

In 2005, the [[United Kingdom|British]] satellite company [[British Sky Broadcasting]] produced an [[investigative journalism|investigative]] piece using [[hidden camera]]s, which included footage of two of Phelps' granddaughters, Libby and Jael.<ref name="sky-video">[http://www.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,91136-1200311,00.html "Inside The Church Of Hate"], [[Sky News]], October 25, 2005</ref> In the testimonial, Libby and Jael explain that they hope and pray that no one outside of Westboro becomes "elect",<ref name="sky-video"/> because they want everyone else in the world to die horribly and burn in Hell,<ref name="sky-video"/> and that even if they did not believe their actions were dictated by God, they would still do and enjoy them anyway.<ref name="sky-video"/> The interview was not part of the hidden camera segment, and although much of the footage was taken without the knowledge or permission of Westboro, the church maintains a link to the entire report on its website.

On April 1, 2007, the British television channel [[BBC Two]] broadcast [[Louis Theroux]]' ''[[The Most Hated Family in America]]''.<ref>Theroux, Louis. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66W_yGUERjY Trailer], [[YouTube]]. [[BBC Two]]</ref> Theroux has presented a number of documentaries about unusual or unconventional people and groups in the UK, the US and elsewhere.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6507971.stm The Most Hated Family in America] (interview with Louis Theroux). [[BBC News]], March 30, 2007</ref> A follow-up documentary by Theroux, ''[[America's Most Hated Family in Crisis]]'', broadcast in the UK on April 3, 2011.

The website godhatesfags.com was prominently featured in ''The [[Jeremy Kyle Show]]'', a talk show aired on the [[ITV]] network in the United Kingdom on June 5, 2007. Church members Shirley and her daughters had been invited to express their beliefs live via satellite.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In the June 21, 2007, [[Channel 4]] documentary ''Keith Allen Will Burn in Hell'', by Welsh personality [[Keith Allen (actor)|Keith Allen]], in which Phelps-Roper and some of her children agreed to appear, Phelps-Roper is shown admitting on camera that her oldest son, Samuel Phelps-Roper, was born out of wedlock. Allen found hypocritical Phelps-Roper's vocal condemnation of strangers having sexual congress outside of marriage while she herself was guilty of the same.<ref>
