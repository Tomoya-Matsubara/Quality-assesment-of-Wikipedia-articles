==Reception==
===Media===
The performance gained widespread attention from the media, after M.I.A. extended the [[Finger (gesture)|middle finger]] to the camera near the end of her verse of the song instead of singing the word "shit".<ref>{{cite web|author=Jackson, Nate|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2012/01/super-bowl-mia-confirms-halftime-performance-with-madonna-and-nicki-minaj.html|title=M.I.A. dishes on Super Bowl appearance with Madonna|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=31 January 2012|accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Gardner, Tim|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gameon/post/2012/02/mia-middle-finger-super-bowl-halftime-show/1|title=M.I.A. flips middle finger during Super Bowl halftime show|date=5 February 2012|accessdate=6 February 2012}}</ref> The incident prompted broadcaster [[NBC]] and the [[National Football League]] to issue apologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/tv/article/nbc-apologizes-mia-giving-finger-halftime-35118|title=NBC Apologizes for M.I.A.

However, a ''Forbes'' analysis said before the event that, with 30-second commercial spots commanding over $3 million apiece, the 12 minutes of free television exposure had a considerable promotional value to Madonna's multiple enterprises coming to market at the time of the event.<ref>[[Zack O'Malley Greenburg|Greenburg, Zack O'Malley]], [http://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2012/02/03/why-madonna-isnt-getting-paid-for-her-super-bowl-halftime-gig/ "Why Madonna Isn't Getting Paid For Her Super Bowl Halftime Gig"], ''Forbes'' blog, February 3, 2012.

===Critical===
Reviews for the performance were positive. ''[[MTV]]'' commented that Madonna ensured that all anyone would be talking about around the water cooler come Monday morning was her, whether or not you completely loved what she did during the show. ''[[Billboard]]'' reviewed it as "It's Madonna Louise Ciccone's world, we're just living in it...The pop icon took to the world's biggest stage to rock three-and-a-half older tracks and a playful new song during the Super Bowl halftime show." ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said Madonna was defiantly unconcerned with the more conservative red state wing of the football fanbase who'd never be caught dead singing along to one of her songs...and her halftime show was pure spectacle by the Cleopatra of the game." ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' commented that "This was Madonna's party, and besides breaking off bits of her greatest hits to remind people of a time when she was the biggest pop vixen on the planet, she had important career-advancing work to do," the review noted. "Madonna, after all, never does anything unless she's got something to sell, and with a new studio album due out in March and a tour to follow, she had plenty on her to-do list."<ref>{{cite web|last=Vena |first=Jocelyn|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1678574/madonna-super-bowl-halftime-show.jhtml|title=Madonna Halftime Show: The Reviews Are In!|publisher=[[MTV]] |date=2012-02-06 |accessdate=2013-02-22}}</ref>
