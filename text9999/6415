He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He is chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Armed Services Committee]].

==Early life, education and career==
Born in [[Tujunga, Los Angeles, California]], McKeon graduated from [[Verdugo Hills High School]] in [[Tujunga, Los Angeles, California|Tujunga]]. He spent two years as a [[Mormon missionary]] before enrolling at [[Brigham Young University]].<ref>http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=M000508</ref> He later received his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[animal husbandry]] in 1985, after previously putting his studies on hold to raise a family and establish his early business career. He was the owner of a Western clothing shop until its bankruptcy in 1999<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/15/local/me-37390 |title=Howard & Phil's Stores Hang Up Their Hats |accessdate=15 November 2011 | work=Los Angeles Times |first1=Miguel |last1=Bustillo |first2=Stephanie |last2=Stassel |date=15 May 1999}}</ref> and has also served as the chairman of a small, regional bank. McKeon gained his first political experience when he was elected to the [[William S. Hart High School District]] board of trustees.

==Early political career==
McKeon was a one-term councilman of [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]], being one of the first to hold that post after the city incorporated in 1987. He held that position until entering the House.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
*'''[[United States House Committee on Armed Services|Committee on Armed Services]]''' (Chairman)
**As chair of the full committee, McKeon may serve as an ''ex officio'' member of all subcommittees. Even though he is the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, McKeon never served in the armed forces.
*'''[[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|Committee on Education and the Workforce]]'''
**[[United States House Education Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training|Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training]]

In 2009, McKeon served as ranking member of the House Committee on Education and Labor. In June, President [[Barack Obama]] nominated Representative [[John M. McHugh]] of [[New York]], who was the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, as [[Secretary of the Army]].  On June 9, the House Republican leadership appointed McKeon as the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee.  Under rules of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], McKeon was required to step down from his position as ranking member of the Education and Labor Committee, though he continues to serve on the committee. McKeon was named chairman of the Committee on Armed Services in January, following the Republican takeover of the House in the November 2010 elections.<ref name="politico.com">http://www.politico.com/blogs/joshgerstein/1011/Buck_McKeon_no_defense_bill_without_gay_marriage_ban_detainee_provisions.html</ref>

As a member of the House, he has made education and defense issues two of his main priorities. He was greatly involved in the reform of the Student Loan Aid Program, which reduced interest rates but controversially increased federal control over education policy, such as teacher training.  He also supports a strong national defense budget. Along with [[Dean Gallo]] of [[New Jersey]], McKeon introduced the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] on March 11, 1993. McKeon is a member of the [[Republican Study Committee]].

==Political campaigns==
In 1992, California gained seven additional seats following the census.  A "new" 25th District was created in the Santa Clarita and Antelope Valleys in north [[Los Angeles County]] and the communities of [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California|Chatsworth]], [[Granada Hills]], [[Northridge, Los Angeles, California|Northridge]], and [[Porter Ranch]] in the northwestern [[San Fernando Valley]].  McKeon was thus the first congressman  to represent the new district.  In the 2002 reapportionment, the San Fernando Valley and portions of the Antelope Valley were removed from the 25th District while [[Inyo County]], [[Mono County]], and about half of the land area within [[San Bernardino County]] were added.  The Los Angeles County portion of the district still includes the cities of Santa Clarita, [[Palmdale]], and part of the city of [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]].  In 2012, the California Citizens Redistricting Commission drew new lines for the 25th district. The "new" district now only contains those previous held areas of Los Angeles County, adds parts of Porter Ranch and Chatsworth in the San Fernando Valley, and expands into parts of Ventura County, including most of Simi Valley.<ref>[http://wedrawthelines.ca.gov California Citizens Redistricting Commission]</ref>

During the 2006 election cycle, McKeon received 60% of the vote in his district, defeating Democrat Robert Rodriguez and Libertarian David Erickson. The district has been considered to be "safe" for the Republican Party because it includes predominantly Republican areas in the Antelope and Santa Clarita Valleys and conservative rural areas of the High Sierras and desert regions of California. Changes in ethnic demographics in the district may make it less a safe Republican district in the future. McKeon handily won reelection with 58% of the vote in 2008, even though Democratic presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] received more votes than his Republican rival John McCain.<ref>[http://www.rollcall.com/issues/54_127/-34690-1.html Democrats See Golden Pickup Opportunities in California],'' [[Roll Call]]'', May 7, 2009</ref>

McKeon<U+2019>s campaigns have received the greatest financial support from the defense industry, especially aerospace companies such as [[Lockheed Martin]], [[Northrop Grumman]], and [[Boeing]].<ref name="Project Vote Smart Endorsements">[http://www.votesmart.org/endorsements.php?can_id=26755 Endorsements], [[Project Vote Smart]]''</ref>  Additionally, he is endorsed by the [[National Rifle Association]], the [[National Federation of Independent Business]], and the California Pro-Life Council .<ref name="Project Vote Smart Endorsements"/>

==Political Stance==
McKeon serves as the chairman on the Armed Services Committee. He assumed the position in January 2011, following the November 2010 elections. He was previously the ranking member of the committee. California<U+2019>s 25th District holds several military bases, including [[Fort Irwin]], [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake]], and the [[Marine Mountain Warfare Training Center]].<ref name="McKeon, Buck">Rep.

"Calif. Republicans to wield power in new Congress." Associated Press State and Local Wire, 17 November 2010. Accessed Online.</ref> 

McKeon voted in favor of American military intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as Barack Obama's Afghanistan "surge" strategy, and has voted for increasing money and supplies to troops there. He has gone on record saying that withdrawal from Afghanistan should be conditions-based, and done with full consultation with senior military leadership. In a statement from May 2010, McKeon outlined his personal philosophy on the role of the United States and its military, calling for a return to <U+201C>peace through strength<U+201D> and Reagan-esque policies, including full financial and material support for the military in its current wars, keeping Guantanamo Bay open, and military posturing.<ref name="McKeon, Buck"/>

In a speech before the Foreign Policy Initiative research group in 2010, McKeon called for increases in government spending on defense above Obama's budgets.<ref>Capaccio, Tony.

==Countrywide Financial loan==
In January 2012, it was reported that McKeon received a so-called "VIP" or "Friends of Angelo" loan from troubled mortgage lender [[Bank of America Home Loans|Countrywide Financial]], in which loans were granted at lower interest rates than were available to the public. Former Countrywide CEO [[Angelo Mozilo]] created the program to boost the company's standing with politicians, celebrities and well-connected business figures. The congressman received a $315,000 loan from Countrywide at below-market rates in the late 1990s. A congressional probe identified an internal Countrywide email regarding McKeon's loan that stated: "Per Angelo<U+2014>'take off 1 point, no garbage fees, approve the loan and make it a no doc.'"<ref>{{cite news|title=Mozilo Tied to Loan to Top Lawmaker |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204468004577167311547612288.html|date=2012-01-18|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|first=John|last=Emshwiller|accessdate=2012-01-19}}</ref> McKeon and names of other legislators who received similar loans were subsequently referred to the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]] as part of an ethics investigation into improper gifts.
