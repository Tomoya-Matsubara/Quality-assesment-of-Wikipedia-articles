'''Swen Eric Nater''' (born January 14, 1950 in [[Den Helder]], [[Netherlands]]) is a retired Dutch professional [[basketball]] player, primarily in the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA) and [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). He is the only player to have led both the NBA and ABA in [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]]. Nater was a two-time [[ABA All-Star]] and was the 1974 [[ABA Rookie of the Year]]. He played [[college basketball]] for the [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA Bruins]], winning two [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) titles.

==Basketball career==
Nater helped [[John Wooden]]'s [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA Bruins]] win two [[List of NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Champions|NCAA titles]]. He was a backup to [[Bill Walton]], and he never started a collegiate game.<ref name="seattlepi.nwsource.com">[http://www.seattlepi.com/basketball/346598_where09.html Dan Raley, Where Are They Now?, Seattle Post Intelligencer, January 9, 2008]</ref><ref name=hartman_smith>{{cite book |last1=Hartman |first1=Steve |last2=Smith |first2=Matt |title=The Great Book of Los Angeles Sports Lists |page=200 |year=2009 |publisher=Running Press |isbn=9780786748877 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0J50W-gUBwIC&lpg=PA200&dq=ucla%20alumni%20nba&pg=PA200#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=March 22, 2012}}</ref>

Nater was drafted by [[The Floridians]] in the 1972 ABA Draft, and then by the [[Virginia Squires]] in the June 1972 ABA dispersal draft after the Floridians' demise.<ref name=br.com>[http://www.basketballreference.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=NaterSw01 BasketballReference.com Swen Nater page]</ref><ref name="remembertheaba.com">[http://www.remembertheaba.com/TeamMaterial/VirginiaMaterial/OaksCapsSquiresYearly.html RememberTheABA.com Virginia Squires detailed year by year notes page]</ref>  Nater was also drafted in the first round of the [[1973 NBA Draft]] by the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] but in August 1973 opted to sign with the Virginia Squires of the ABA.<ref name="remembertheaba.com"/> On November 21, 1973 the Squires traded Nater to the [[San Antonio Spurs]] for a draft pick and $300,000.<ref name="remembertheaba.com"/>

With the Spurs Nater was the [[American Basketball Association]] Rookie of the Year in 1974,<ref name=hartman_smith/> led the ABA in field goal percentage in 1974, and led the ABA in rebounding in 1975.  He was named to the All-ABA Second Team in 1974 and 1975, and participated in the ABA All-Star Game both seasons.<ref name=br.com/>  During his three seasons in the ABA, Nater played for the [[San Antonio Spurs]], the [[Virginia Squires]], and the [[New Jersey Nets|New York Nets]].

Nater's NBA career began with the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], and he was traded after one season to the [[Los Angeles Clippers|Buffalo Braves]]. When the Braves played in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], Nater became a local favorite. Nater led the NBA in rebounding average during the [[1979-80 NBA season|1979-80 season]], making him the only player ever to lead both the NBA and ABA in rebounding.<ref name=hartman_smith/>

Before the [[1983-84 NBA season|1983-84 season]], Nater was traded by the Clippers along with a just-drafted [[Byron Scott (basketball)|Byron Scott]] to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] for [[Norm Nixon]], [[Eddie Jordan (basketball)|Eddie Jordan]], and a 1986 second-round draft pick (which would eventually be dealt to the [[Phoenix Suns]] and become [[Jeff Hornacek]]).  Nater and Scott helped lead the Lakers to the NBA Finals that year, after which Nater retired as a player.

==After NBA==
He built the basketball program [[San Diego Christian College|Christian Heritage College]] in [[San Diego, California]], and coached from 1985 to 1995.<ref name="BigManLovedGame">{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/11/sports/then-and-now-swen-nater-big-man-loved-the-game-then-learned-to-play-it.html | title=THEN AND NOW -- Swen Nater; Big Man Loved the Game, Then Learned to Play It | publisher=[[New York Times]] | date= January 11, 2004 | first= Chris| last= Broussard| accessdate =2009-07-08}}</ref> He left the position because it "was high on work and low on pay" for employment at [[Costco]].<ref name="BigManLovedGame"/> As of 2010 he was still working there.<ref name="seattlepi.nwsource.com"/>
Nater has also co-authored books with legendary basketball coaches Wooden and [[Pete Newell]].
