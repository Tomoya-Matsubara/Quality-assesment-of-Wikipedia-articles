'''BuzzSaw''' is a [[Maurer S<U+00F6>hne]] [[SkyLoop]] [[roller coaster]] located within the [[Town of Gold Rush]] section of the [[Dreamworld]] [[amusement park]] on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] of [[Australia]]. The ride began operation on 17 September 2011 as part of [[Dreamworld's 30th Birthday|Dreamworld's 30th birthday celebrations]].<ref name="DW home 2011-08-20">{{cite web|title=Dreamworld - Australia's Favourite Gold Coast Theme Parks|url=http://www.dreamworld.com.au/|publisher=Dreamworld|accessdate=20 August 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/614CaOb19|archivedate=20 August 2011|date=19 August 2011}}</ref><ref name="New thrill rides for Coast theme parks">{{cite news|last=Maeseele|first=Melanie|title=New thrill rides for Coast theme parks|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2011/09/15/349755_tourism-news.html|accessdate=15 September 2011|newspaper=Gold Coast Bulletin|publisher=News Limited|date=15 September 2011}}</ref><ref name="New Dreamworld ride a real Buzz"/>

BuzzSaw is one of Dreamworld's "Big 8" thrill rides and has a track length of {{Convert|150|m}}. The steel ride consists of a single train which holds 12 riders and lasts approximately 50&nbsp;seconds. BuzzSaw features the tallest [[Roller coaster inversion|inversion]] in the Southern Hemisphere and is currently the second-highest inversion of its type in the world.

The ride is themed around a series of unexplainable occurrences in the Town of Gold Rush which date back to the late 1800s. The setting is based on encounters with the ghost of one Jack Darke, who was killed by a [[Circular saw|buzz saw]] at a sawmill built after the gold rush ended.

===Backstory===
BuzzSaw is themed around a series of unexplainable occurrences in the Town of Gold Rush which date back to the late 1800s.<ref name="Dreamworld unveils latest thrill ride" /> In 1876, the Town of Gold Rush was formed. It was a prosperous town during the great [[gold rush]]. After the gold ran out in 1887, they established a [[sawmill]] and turned their focus to timber. On a clear moon-lit night, a sawmill worker named Jack Darke was killed by the buzz saw after he had a scuffle with some other workers who were attempting to set the building on fire. The circumstances leading up to his death were covered up by the town with the legend stating that Jack tried to burn down the sawmill and slipped into the path of the buzz saw.<ref name="Official - Backstory">{{cite web|title=BuzzSaw - Backstory|url=http://www.dreamworld.com.au/Rides/Thrill-Rides/BuzzSaw/Backstory.aspx|publisher=Dreamworld|accessdate=20 August 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/614DnOGSi|archivedate=20 August 2011|date=19 August 2011}}</ref> The sawmill has remained closed since<ref name="Official - Backstory"/> with many people claiming encounters with the ghost of Jack on nights similar to that of his death.<ref name="Ghost Videos">{{cite web|title=BuzzSaw Ghost Videos|url=http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8F03E56A87855833|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=20 August 2011|author=Dreamworld|date=18 August 2011}}</ref>

Several television screens are embedded in the walls and show burning timber. Parts of the theming are caged off with crime scene signs. Throughout the queue, guests are able to hear the sound of buzzsaws as well as several warnings to not go any further and to escape while they can.<ref name="Parkz Update 2011-10-22">{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Richard|title=Dreamworld, October 22, 2011|url=http://www.parkz.com.au/update/2011/11/02/289-Dreamworld_October_22_2011.html|work=The Parkz Update|publisher=Parkz|accessdate=4 November 2011|date=22 October 2011}}</ref> Large [[circular saw]]s (a.k.a. buzzsaws) are located on the side and roof of the building.<ref name="Early Sept Parkz Update">{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Richard|title=The Parkz Update: September 16, 2011 - Dreamworld|url=http://www.parkz.com.au/update/2011/09/16/|work=The Parkz Update|publisher=Parkz|accessdate=16 September 2011|date=16 September 2011}}</ref>
