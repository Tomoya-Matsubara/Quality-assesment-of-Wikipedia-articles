The '''Foundation Stone of the Monument to the Early Founders of Singapore''', usually called the '''Early Founders Memorial Stone''' is a national [[memorial]] that is dedicated to the early founders ("Unknown Immigrants") of [[Singapore]]. The original idea was mooted by a graduates' association and an open design competition was held for the memorial project. The foundation stone was initially erected along Collyer Quay Street outside the [[The Fullerton Hotel Singapore|Fullerton Hotel]] in 1970. After a series of setbacks and delays, the project  was finally scrapped after no worthy design was accepted, which resulted the foundation stone becoming the memorial afterwards. In 2000, the memorial was relocated to the [[National Archives of Singapore]] at Canning Rise where it stands today.

==History==
[[Image:Queen Elizabeth Walk, Aug 06.JPG|thumb|250px|The [[Queen Elizabeth Walk]] was the proposed site for the national memorial. In the background is the [[The Fullerton Hotel Singapore|Fullerton Hotel]] (building in white), where the memorial stone was initially erected in 1970]] 
The original idea of erecting a [[keynote]] memorial at the Singapore waterfront as a dedication to Singapore's early founders was mooted in 1969 by the Alumni International Singapore (AIS), a body set up to represent Singaporean graduates from 11 countries who had gathered locally for Singapore's 150th anniversary.<ref name="Brazil">Brazil, "A Sadly Unfinished Monument &ndash; Early Founders Memorial Stone," 9-10.</ref> AIS announced that a proposed memorial on [[Queen Elizabeth Walk]] by the [[Padang, Singapore|Padang]] would required some [[S$]]250,000 ([[US$]]163,000) to be raised. An open design competition was held and [[sculptor]]s were asked to come up with a design to celebrate the Singaporean for "his courage, his adventurous and enterprising spirit and his indomitable will, not only to survive but to make good."<ref name="Brazil"/>

===Foundation stone===
On January 18, 1970, [[President of Singapore|President]] [[Yusof bin Ishak]] laid the memorial's [[Cornerstone|foundation stone]] along [[Collyer Quay|Collyer Quay Street]], on what was supposed to be a temporary site. Before an audience of some 500 people, including members of the diplomatic corps, President Yusof gave a speech: 

{{blockquote|It carries no great names. In fact it has no names at all. It is for all men. It is not for the [[Chinese in Singapore|Chinese]], the [[Indians in Singapore|Indian]], the [[Eurasians in Singapore|Eurasian]] or any other single race. It is for all who in one way or another helped to create a modern multiracial, multicultural and multilingual Singapore.<ref> Brazil, "For All Who Created Modern Singapore," p. 10. </ref> }}

The foundation stone consists of a rectangular [[granite]] stone topping off a [[pyramid]]-shaped brick pedestal with inscriptions in the four [[Languages of Singapore|official languages]] ([[English language|English]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Mandarin language|Mandarin]], and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]): 

{{blockquote|This foundation stone of the monument in tribute to the early founders of Singapore was laid by Inche Yusof Bin Ishak, the President of the Republic of Singapore on the 18th day of Janauary 1970.<ref>Information obtained from on-site foundation stone.</ref>}}

===Competition===
In July 1973, designs for the memorial had been received from 38 sculptors but the top two prizes were not awarded; it was found that no entry being deemed worthy of the honour by AIS panel of judges earlier. Instead, five sculptors received merit awards from AIS, together with a token S$250.<ref name="Brazil-2"> Brazil, "Controversy erupts", p. 10. </ref>

One of the merit awards recipients, [[Ng Eng Teng]], who was to receive Singapore's [[Cultural Medallion]] in 1981 and who now has his critically-acclaimed works all over Singapore, commented unhappily: "We have never been so embarrassed or insulted in all our professional lives. No professional artist of our standing would condescend to receive such an amount. We felt we had been taken for a ride."<ref name="Brazil-2"/>

In response, AIS expressed regret that the aggrieved sculptors had publicly stated their dissatisfaction. The alumni further rejected a complaint that the results were 10 months overdue, and repeated that no suitable entry had been received. Subsequently, three of the five sculptors banded together to produce a design they described as "four pieces of [[cuboid]] leaning towards each other and pivoted on four corners" which was referred by AIS as resembling "four [[chopstick]]s".<ref name="Brazil-2"/> Ironically, this was the nickname and roughly the design concept of the [[Civilian War Memorial]], which was adopted in another separate open competition in 1966.<ref name="Brazil-2"/>

In September 1975, the alumni announced in public again that the Early Founders Project was at "a very advanced stage and will be launched as soon as Government approval has been obtained. The site of the monument has already been earmarked on the reclaimed land off the [[Esplanade, Singapore|Esplanade]]."<Ref name="Brazil-2"/>

Despite the announcement, the ambitious project became inactive and was finally scrapped after no worthy design was accepted and not nearly enough of the S$250,000 funds had been raised. In 1985, the alumni announced that the funds collected earlier would be rediverted to other projects, such as providing scholarships.<Ref name="Brazil-2"/>

===Roles switched===
As a result, the memorial stone became the memorial itself. The monument was later moved by the authorities to make way for the [[gentrification]] of the Fullerton Building, and was relocated to the National Archives of Singapore, where it stands almost forgotten today. The authorities hope that when Singapore's community of values had evolved to the point that a common language of art could be used to complete the task of building such a monument again.<ref> Schoppert, "More Trouble Than It Is Worth - What can we expect from public art in Singapore?" </ref>
