'''Preston''' ({{pron-en|<U+02C8>pr<U+025B>st<U+0259>n|en-uk-Preston.ogg}}) is a [[city]] and [[non-metropolitan district]] of [[Lancashire]], in [[North West England]]. It is located on the north bank of the [[River Ribble]], and was granted [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 2002, becoming England's 50th city in the 50th year of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]'s reign.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1872505.stm 'Proud Preston' wins city status]", BBC News, 14 March 2002.

Preston and its surroundings have provided evidence of ancient [[Roman Britain|Roman]] activity in the area, largely in the form of a [[Roman road]] which led to a camp at [[Walton-le-Dale]]. The [[Saxons]] established Preston; the name Preston is derived from [[Old English]] words meaning "Priest settlement" and in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' appears as "Prestune". During the [[Middle Ages]], Preston formed a parish and [[township]] in the hundred of [[Amounderness]] and was granted a Guild Merchant charter in 1179, giving it the status of a [[market town]]. Textiles have been produced in Preston since the middle of the 13th century, when locally produced wool was woven in people's houses. [[Flemish people|Flemish]] weavers who settled in the area during the 14th century helped to develop the industry. Sir [[Richard Arkwright]], inventor of the [[spinning frame]], was a weaver born in Preston. The most rapid period of growth and development in Preston's history coincided with the industrialisation and expansion of [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|textile manufacturing]]. Preston was a [[boomtown]] of the [[Industrial Revolution]], becoming a densely populated engineering centre, with large industrial plants.

In the early 18th century a writer said Preston was "a pretty town with an abundance of gentry in it, commonly called Proud Preston".<ref>{{citation

Preston has subsequently faced similar challenges to other [[Post-industrial society|post-industrial]] [[Northern England|northern]] towns, including [[deindustrialisation]], economic deprivation and housing issues. However, Preston has continued to develop; it is the seat of [[Lancashire County Council]] and [[Preston North End F.C.]], one of the oldest football clubs, now houses the [[National Football Museum]].

==History==
===Etymology===
Preston is recorded in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' as "Prestune" in 1086.<ref>Hunt, 1992. p. 9.</ref> Various other spellings occur in early documents: "Prestonam" (1094), "Prestone" (1160), "Prestona" (1160), "Presteton" (1180), and "Prestun" (1226). The modern spelling occurs in 1094, 1176, 1196, 1212 and 1332.<ref>Hunt, 1992. p. 10.</ref> The town's name is derived from [[Old English]] ''Presta'' and ''Tun'', the ''Tun''(enclosure, farmstead, village, manor, estate).<ref>[http://heraldry.sca.org/laurel/names/engplnam.html]</ref> of the ''Presta'' (priest or priests).<ref>Hunt, 2003. p. 31.</ref>

===Early development===
During the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period, the main road from [[Luguvalium]] (Carlisle) to [[Mamucium]] (Manchester) forded the [[River Ribble]] at [[Walton-le-Dale]], <U+00BE>&nbsp;mile (1&nbsp;km) southeast of the centre of Preston. Here was a Roman camp, probably a regional depot for military equipment or other supplies. At Withy Trees, 1<U+00BD>&nbsp;miles (2&nbsp;km) north of Preston, the road crossed another Roman road from [[Bremetennacum]] (the Roman fort at [[Ribchester]]) to the coast.<ref>Hodge, 1997. pp. 3-5.</ref>

In [[Ripon]] in 705 AD the lands near the [[River Ribble]] were set on a new foundation, and the parish church was probably erected. This parish church was probably situated on the grounds of the present Anglican parish of St. John the Evangelist on Church Street, which was originally dedicated to [[St. Wilfrid]] and then later [[St. John the Baptist]]. Later, [[Edward the Elder]] endowed the lands to the Cathedral at [[York]] and then, by means of successive transfers the lands were exchanged between lesser churches, hence the origin of the name ''Priest's Town'' or Preston.  An alternative explanation of the origin of the name is that the Priest's Town refers to a priory set up by [[St. Wilfrid]] near the Ribble's lowest ford. This idea is supported by the similarity of the [[Paschal lamb]] on Preston's crest with that on St. Wilfrid's.<ref>Walsh and Butler, 1992.</ref> 

When first mentioned in the 1086 [[Domesday Book]], Preston was already the most important town in [[Amounderness]] (the area of Central Lancashire between the rivers [[River Ribble|Ribble]] and [[River Cocker (Lancashire)|Cocker]], including the [[Fylde]] and the [[Forest of Bowland]]). When assessed for tax purposes in 1218 - 19 it was the wealthiest town in the whole county.<ref>Hodge, 1997. pp. 6-10.</ref>

===Guild Merchant===

The right to hold a [[Guild Merchant]] was conferred upon the Burgesses of Preston by a charter of 1179;<ref>[http://www.preston.gov.uk/General.asp?id=SX9452-A77FA185&cat=1806 Preston's History]</ref> the associated Preston Guild is a civic celebration held every 20 years, with the next one due in 2012.<ref>[http://www.preston.gov.uk/GeneralM.asp?id=SX9452-A77F9FB8&cat=1806 Once Every preston Guild]</ref>

Before 1328 a celebration had been held on an irregular basis, but at the Guild of that year it was decreed that subsequent Guilds should be held every twenty years. After this there were breaks in the pattern for various reasons, but an unbroken series were held from 1542 to 1922. A full 400 year sequence was frustrated by the cancellation of the 1942 Guild due to [[World War II]], but the cycle resumed in 1952.  The expression '(Once) every Preston Guild', meaning 'very infrequently', has passed into fairly common use, especially in Lancashire.

Guild week is always started by the opening of the Guild Court, which since the Sixteenth century has traditionally been on the first Monday after the feast of the decollation (the beheading) of [[St John the Baptist]]. As well as concerts and other exhibitions, the main events are a series of processions through the city. Numerous street parties are typically also held in the locality.

In 1952, the emphasis was on the bright new world emerging after [[World War II]]. The major event held in the city's [[Avenham Park]] had every school participating, and hundreds of children, from toddlers to teenagers, demonstrated different aspects of physical education in the natural amphitheatre of the park.

===Pre-Industrial Preston===
In the mid-12th century, Preston was in the hundred of [[Amounderness]], in the deanery of Amounderness and the archdeaconry of [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]]. The name "Amounderness" is more ancient than the name of any other "Wapentake" or hundred in the County of Lancashire, and the fort at Tulketh, strengthened by [[William the Conqueror]], shows that the strategic importance of the area was appreciated even then.<ref>[http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/lancashire1.html The County of Lancashire, England, UK<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Served by the [[River Ribble]] which flows through the city, Preston was so much the principal port of Lancashire that in the run-up to the English Civil War [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] demanded a quarter more ship money from Preston than from nearby [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] and twice as much as from [[Liverpool]]. {{Fact|date=August 2008}}

The location of the city, almost exactly mid-way between [[Glasgow]] and [[London]], led to many decisive battles being fought here, most notably during the [[English Civil War]] (1648), and the first [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] rebellion whose invasion of England was brought to a conclusion by the defeat of the pro-Catholic and pro-monarchial Jacobite army at the [[Battle of Preston (1715)]] which remains the most recent major battle on English soil (though there were further battles with Jacobite or allied forces in Scotland in 1718, 1745 and 1746). {{Fact|date=June 2008}}

In the last great Jacobite Rising, on 27 November 1745 the Jacobite Prince of Wales and Regent, [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]] passed through Preston with his Highland Army on the way south through Chorley and Manchester to Derby intending to take London and the Crown. Preston was the first of the very few places in England where the Prince was cheered as he rode by and where he was actually joined by some English volunteers for his Army. From 10 to 12 December the Prince gave his retreating Army a rest in Preston on their long, last and fatal retreat from Derby through Lancaster and Carlisle to their dreadful day of destiny the following 16 April on [[Culloden]] Moor near [[Inverness]].<ref>Fitzroy Maclean, 'Bonnie Prince Charlie' 1988</ref>

===Industrial Revolution===
[[Image:Plaque in Preston Lancashire commemorating Rev Joseph (Daddy) Dunn and first gas-lit building.jpg|thumb|Plaque on building in Fox Street commemorating Rev. Joseph (Daddy) Dunn and his work in bringing gas lighting to Preston]]

The 19th century saw a transformation in Preston from a small market town to a much larger industrial one, as the innovations of the latter half of the previous century such as [[Richard Arkwright]]'s [[water frame]] (invented in Preston) brought cotton mills to many northern English towns.  With industrialisation came examples of both oppression and enlightenment.

The town's forward-looking spirit is typified by it being the first English town outside London to be lit by gas.  The Preston Gas Company was established in 1815 by, amongst others, a Catholic priest: Rev. Joseph "Daddy" Dunn of the [[Society of Jesus]].

The more oppressive side of industrialisation was seen on Saturday 13 August 1842, when a group of cotton workers demonstrated against the poor conditions in the town's mills.  The [[Riot Act]] was read and armed troops corralled the demonstrators in front of the Corn Exchange on Lune Street.  Shots were fired and four of the demonstrators were killed.  A commemorative sculpture now stands on the spot (although the soldiers and demonstrators represented are facing the wrong way). In the 1850s, [[Karl Marx]] visited Preston and later described the town as "the next [[St. Petersburg]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1854/08/01a.htm|title=Karl Marx in the New York Daily Tribune 1854|date=1854-08-01|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref> [[Charles Dickens]] visited Preston in January 1854 during a strike by cotton workers that had by that stage lasted for 23 weeks. This was part of his research for the novel ''[[Hard Times]]'' in which the town of "Coketown" is based on the city of Preston.

[[Image:PrestonCityCenterRoad.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Preston now has a modern city centre.]]

The Preston Temperance Society, led by Joseph Livesey pioneered the [[Teetotalism|Temperance Movement]] in the 19th century. Indeed the term [[teetotalism]] is believed to have been coined at one of its meetings.  The website of the [[University of Central Lancashire]] library has a great deal of information on Joseph Livesey and the Temperance Movement in Preston.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uclan.ac.uk/library/usersupport/lrs/collections/livesey/index.htm|title=The Livesey Collection|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref>

Preston was one of only a few industrial towns in Lancashire to have a functioning corporation (local council) in 1835, its charter dating to 1685, and was reformed as a [[municipal borough]] by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]].  It became a [[county borough]] under the [[Local Government Act 1888]].  In 1974, county boroughs were abolished, and it became the larger part of the new non-metropolitan district of Preston in Lancashire, also including [[Fulwood, Lancashire|Fulwood]] and part of [[Preston Rural District]].

===Religion===
[[Image:PrestonStJohnTheEvangelistMinsterChurch.JPG|thumb|right|St John the Evangelist Minster Church in Church Street, Preston]]

Preston has a strong [[Christian]] (particularly [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]]) history and tradition, and has been called the most Catholic city in England {{Who|date=June 2008}}. One of the proposed derivations of the name Preston is from 'Priests town' and the lamb on the city's shield is a biblical image of Jesus Christ, the same image that represented St. Wilfrid, a 7th century bishop and the city's patron saint, who is historically linked to the city's establishment. The "PP" on the shield stands for either "Proud Preston" or "Princeps Pacis" (Prince of Peace), another title for Christ invoking Him as protector of the city. {{Fact|date=June 2008}}

As well as mainstream denominations like [[Roman Catholicism]] and the [[Church of England]], the city has seen a recent emergence of new evangelical churches. Preston has a strong history for [[Free Methodism]], as there are currently four Free Methodist churches in the area. Preston's Guild Hall plays host to a large [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] worship music event called 'Encounter' every year. {{Fact|date=June 2008}}

Preston was the location of the world's first foreign mission of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (commonly known as the Mormons). As early as 1837 the first [[Mormon missionaries]] to Great Britain began preaching in Preston and, in particular, other small towns situated along the river Ribble. Preston is home to the world's oldest continuous [[Ward (LDS Church)#Branches|branch]] (a small congregation) of the Mormon Church.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org.uk/media_news.php |author= |title=Media Newsroom |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-05-22}}</ref> An official memorial to the church pioneers may be found in the Japanese Garden in Avenham Park. In 1998 the LDS erected a large temple at [[Chorley]], near Preston, described by [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] newspaper as "spectacular".<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1998/05/15/nmor15.html  Mormons reveal secrets of the temple]. www.telegraph.co.uk. Retrieved 4 June 2008.</ref>  The temple is officially known as the [[Preston England Temple]].

==Governance==
===Preston City Council===
{{see|Preston local elections}}

[[Image:Prestoncity.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Entering the city centre from Fylde Road]]The City of Preston is divided into 22 district council wards represented by 57 councillors. There are nine wards with two councillors and 13 wards with three councillors. The two seat wards cover c. 3600 electors and the three seat wards c. 5400 electors. Preston City councillors serve a four-year term. Preston City Council is elected "by thirds", 19 at a time. One councillor from each of the three-member wards is elected every year for three years. In each of those years six of the nine two-seat wards also elect a councillor. Every fourth year there are no Preston City Council elections, [[Lancashire County Council]] elections taking place instead.

After the [[Preston Council election, 2007|2007 local election]] the Labour Party was the largest Group with 24 members but the Conservatives with 20 seats in alliance with the Liberal Democrats with 10 seats took control of the Cabinet and all committees except the Scrutiny committee. This situation continued after the [[Preston Council election, 2008|2008 local election]] at which the Conservatives, with 21 Councillors took a net seat from the Liberal Democrats who had 9 seats. Labour remained the largest party with 24 members.

The local areas of Preston can be found at [[Districts of Preston]]

The current mayor is Councillor John Swindells.

Preston operates a Leader and Cabinet system. The current Leader is councillor Ken Hudson.

===Freedom of the City===

Freedom of the City has been granted to: 

*The [[Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)]] 7 August 1952
This was subsequently transferred to:
**The [[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]] 9 September 1972
**The [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment]] 1 July 2006

===Lancashire County Council===
{{see|Lancashire local elections}}

The City of Preston contains ten Lancashire County Council [[ward (politics)|electoral divisions]] with one county councillor in each district.

===Parliament===
The City of Preston is currently divided between three Westminster constituencies, which will be altered in size and shape when proposed boundary changes are implemented for the [[next United Kingdom general election]].

Currently the three constituencies are: [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]], [[Ribble Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Ribble Valley]], and [[Fylde (UK Parliament constituency)|Fylde]]. When the proposed boundary changes are implemented, the city will continue to be divided between Preston, and Fylde seats, whilst the northern quarters will be placed within [[Wyre and Preston North (UK Parliament constituency)|Wyre and Preston North]].

Historically, Preston has been divided between such constituencies as [[Preston North (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston North]], [[Preston South (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston South]], and [[Fylde South (UK Parliament constituency)|Fylde South]] although until 1885 it comprised one constituency called Preston but which included most of west Lancashire.

==Geography==
===Physical geography===

The [[River Ribble]] provides a southern border for the city. The [[Forest of Bowland]] forms a backdrop to Preston to the east while [[the Fylde]] lies to the west. At {{coord|53|45|N|2|42|W}}, Preston is approximately 27 miles north west of [[Manchester]], 26 miles north east of [[Liverpool]], and 15 miles east of the coastal town [[Blackpool]].

Preston is located on top of a hill to the west of the [[Pennines]]. It therefore, like most of inland Lancashire, receives a higher than UK average total of rainfall, and is slightly colder. On 10 August 1893 Preston entered the [[UK Weather Records]], with the ''Highest 5-min total'' [[rainfall]] of 32&nbsp;mm. As of November 2008 this remains a record.<ref>[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/extremes/index.html Met Office: Extreme Weather]</ref>

===Areas and Estates===
{{see|List of places in Preston, Lancashire}}

As with many cities, Preston has developed from a number of former towns and villages.

===Civic geography===
The southern part of the district is mostly urbanised but the northern part is quite rural.  The current borders came into effect on 1 April 1974, when the [[Local Government Act 1972]] merged the existing [[County Borough]] of Preston with [[Fulwood, Lancashire|Fulwood]] [[Urban District]] and part of [[Preston Rural District]].  Preston was designated as part of the [[Central Lancashire]] new town in 1970.  The former Preston Rural District part of the district is divided into a number of [[civil parish]]es:

*[[Barton, Preston|Barton]]
*[[Broughton-in-Amounderness]]
*[[Goosnargh]]
*[[Grimsargh]]
*[[Haighton]]
*[[Lea, Lancashire|Lea and Cottam]]
*[[Whittingham, Lancashire|Whittingham]]
*[[Woodplumpton]]

Despite officially having been granted city status in the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Queen's Golden Jubilee]] year in 2002, Preston has no [[cathedral]], historically a requirement in the United Kingdom before city status can be granted by the monarch. However, Preston's parish church has attained the status of [[Minster (church)|Minster]].

==Demographics==
===Ethnicity===
Preston is a diverse city, although the majority of the non-indigenous people are [[British Asian|South Asians]], in particular [[British Indian|Indians]]. The ethnic makeup of Preston based on 2006 estimates is as follows (With national average in brackets): 82.2% [[White British]] (84.2%), 1.0% [[Irish Briton|White Irish]] (1.1%), 1.6% [[Other White]] (3.3%). 1.6% [[British Mixed|Mixed Race]] (1.6%). 8.1% [[British Indian|Indian]] (2.5%), 2.5% [[British Pakistanis|Pakistani]] (1.7%), 0.3% [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshi]] (0.7%), 0.5% [[British Asian|Other South Asian]] (0.6%). 0.6% [[Caribbean British|Black Caribbean]] (1.2%), 0.4% [[Black British|Black African]] (1.4%), 0.1% [[Black British|Other Black]] (0.2%). 0.8% [[British Chinese|Chinese]] (0.7%) and 0.3% [[Oriental British|Other East Asian]] and [[British Arabs|Arab]] (0.7%).<ref>[http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b=277022&c=Preston&d=13&e=13&g=463253&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1202935807210&enc=1&dsFamilyId=1812 Neighbourhood Statistics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Child Poverty===
A new council survey in Preston has revealed that 50% of all children living in the city are living in families suffering from financial depression. An estimated 15,380 youngsters are part of the families on the breadline. The Campaign to End Child Poverty report defines children in poverty as children living in homes where occupants work less than 16 hours a week, or not at all, or where the full amount of tax credit is being claimed. The city is one of the most severely affected areas of the [[North West England|North West]] outside [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]], with 21% of children in the city living in households which are completely workless and a further 29% in families struggling to get by with working tax credits. And in some areas of Preston, more than 75% of children live below the poverty line. The two worst affected areas of the city are the [[Deepdale]] and [[St George's]] wards, where 75% and 77% of children respectively are said to be living in poverty. <ref>[http://www.lep.co.uk/news/New-survey-reveals-children39s-deprivation.4601814.jp]</ref>
{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

===Religion===
The 2001 [[Census]] recorded 71.5% of the population as Christians, 9.8% as having no religion, and 8.2% as Muslims.<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/30UK-A.asp Census 2001: Statistics.] URL accessed on 6 June 2006.</ref> The Hindu and Sikh populations are smaller at 2.6% and 0.6% respectively, but in both cases this represents the highest percentage of any local authority area in the North West. 1.8% of the city's population were born in other EU countries. Though still small in number in Preston, the [[Mormon]]s (officially known as members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] - LDS for short) maintain a large profile.

==Landmarks==
[[Image:St Walburge's Church spire, Preston 231-10.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Saint Walburge's Church]] Preston's premier [[landmark]] is [[St Walburge's Church]], designed by [[Joseph Hansom]] of [[Hansom Cab]] fame. At {{convert|94|m|0}}, it boasts the tallest spire in [[England]] on a [[Church (building)|church]] that is not a [[cathedral]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city-visitor.com/preston/information.html|title=Guide to Preston|accessdate=2007-08-24}}</ref> There are also many notable buildings dotted in and around the city centre including the Miller Arcade, the Town Hall, the [[Harris Museum]]<!--I assume that was what was meant by previous version's "Harris Building"? Or do you mean the Avenham Institute?-->, St. John the Evangelist's [[Minster (cathedral)|Minster]], the former Corn Exchange and Public Hall, St. Wilfrid's Catholic Church, Fishergate Baptist Church, and many beautiful Georgian buildings on [[Winckley Square]]. Many Catholic and Anglican parish churches are also to be found throughout the city. The chimney of the Grade II listed Tulketh Mill [http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2418/2218694992_ca19e415fa.jpg?v=0], recently fully exposed on the Blackpool Road, provides an impressive reminder of Preston's industrial heritage. [[Preston (HM Prison)|HMP Preston]] is also a good example of a typical Victorian radial-design prison. Modern architecture is represented by the Guild Hall and [[Preston Bus Station]].

==Economy==

Preston is a major centre of the British defence aerospace industry with [[BAE Systems]], the UK's principal military aircraft design, development and manufacture supplier, having its Military Aircraft headquarters located in nearby [[Warton, Fylde|Warton]]. The company has two of its major facilities located some miles on either side of the city. [[BAE Warton]] is located to the western side of the city whilst [[BAE Samlesbury]] is located to the east, over the [[M6 motorway]]. BAe Systems also operate large office facilities at the Portway area within the city and at The Strand office complex.

[[Image:Eurofighter Typhoon 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Eurofighter Typhoon|Typhoon]], which is built at [[BAE Samlesbury]] and assembled at [[BAE Warton]] to the west of the city]]

The [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] (formerly [[BNFL]]) Springfields nuclear processing plant also lies to the west of the City boundary.

The city is home to [[Alstom]] Transport's main UK spare parts distribution centre.  [[Matalan]] Retail Ltd was also founded in Preston under the name Matalan Cash and Carry. Although the head office of Matalan moved to [[Skelmersdale]] in 1998, the city still has the tax office for the company (located in [[Winckley Square]]).

[[Image:EnteringPrestonCityCenter.jpg|thumb|upright|right|200px|Entering Preston City Centre]]

Convenience store chain operator James Hall and Co who supply [[SPAR]] stores in the north of England have their head office located in the [[Ribbleton]] district, although it is soon to be moved to a new building in the Bluebell Way area of the city, which would be the biggest building in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.preston-city.com/files/news/PCC%20Newsletter%20v4.pdf|format=PDF|title=Confirmation of Relocation|accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref>

The financial sector also has a large presence in the city with a large selection of consultancies, insurance and law firms including national debt collection agency Legal & Trade based in [[Winckley Square]] in the city centre.

[[Image:PrestonCityCentre.jpg|thumb|upright|right|200px|Preston City Centre is now the location of many businesses]]

Preston is the home of [[NetFlights.com]], part of the Gold Medal Travel Group.

Goss Graphic Systems Limited, a global supplier of [[printing press]]es based in the [[United States]], formerly employed more than 1,000 people in Preston, but in 2007 the company moved manufacturing to the United States, China and Japan and now has around 160 employees in the city.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lep.co.uk/news/Goss-in-talks-to-axe.5109639.jp | title=Goss in talks to axe 60 more staff | first=David | last=Coates | work=[[Lancashire Evening Post]] | publisher=[[Johnston Press]] | date=2009-03-25 | 2009-04-05 }}</ref>

On the 20 February 2006, the telecommunications company [[The Carphone Warehouse]] took over Tulketh Mill (formerly the home of the [[Littlewoods]] catalogue call centre) in the [[Ashton-on-Ribble]] area of the city. The building has undergone an extensive interior refurbishment and since March 2007 has been the workplace of some 800 employees . The site's main purpose is as a [[call centre]] for the company's [[broadband]] and [[landline]] services [[TalkTalk (telecommunications company)|TalkTalk]] as well as its [[Local-loop unbundling|LLU]] business Opal Telecom. It was officially opened on 19 December 2006 by CEO [[Charles Dunstone]] and the Mayor of Preston.

Preston was also home to a small "new business" department of finance broker Loans.co.uk, which took over New City House when [[Norwich Union]] moved its call centre to India. Loans.co.uk ceased trading 6th Dec 2008, and closed its doors for good 6 March 2009, with the loss of 60 jobs in Preston.
Retail is also a major contributor to Preston's economy. The city houses two major shopping centres:
*[[Fishergate Shopping Centre]] - which has a large [[Debenhams]] department store, [[Primark]], [[TK Maxx]], [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] and [[T.J. Hughes]] stores.
*[[The Mall Preston|The Mall]] (formerly ''St. George's'') - a popular centrally located shopping mall dating from the 1960s.

Another shopping centre in Preston is the Miller Arcade, a specialist shopping centre in a listed building, which formerly included [[public baths]], situated next to the [[Harris Museum]].

[[Image:PrestonShoppingDistrict.jpg|thumb|upright|right|200px|One of Preston's main shopping districts.]]

Preston's main high streets are Fishergate and Friargate which offer shops, bars and restaurants with many more tucked away down the side streets. The first [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] outlet in the UK was opened in Fishergate.

An <U+00A3>800 million<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lep.co.uk/travel/800-million-plan-could-cause.3805457.jp|title=<U+00A3>800 million plan could cause more traffic chaos|accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref> regeneration project known as the [[Preston Tithebarn redevelopment|Tithebarn Project]] is also planned for Preston. The project is being managed by property giants [[Grosvenor Group|Grosvenor]] and [[Lend Lease Corporation]] and is dependent upon a number of requirements (such as the re-location of the current [[Preston Bus Station|Bus Station]]).

Since city status was awarded in the Queen's Jubilee year, Preston has been targeted by a number of developers. Residential developments are particularly popular with new apartments planned in and around the city centre. Office and hotel space is also in demand and a new Central Business District is being planned as well as a number of new hotels.

==Transport==
===Road===
[[Image:PrestonShoppingArea.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The district around Preston Bus Station.]]

The Preston by-pass, opened 5 December 1958, became the first stretch of [[motorway]] in the UK and is now part of the [[M6 motorway|M6]] with a short section now forming part of the [[M55 motorway|M55]]. It was built to ease traffic congestion in Preston caused by tourists travelling to the popular destinations of [[Blackpool]] and [[Lake District|The Lake District]]. The first [[traffic cones]] were used during its construction, replacing red lantern paraffin burners.

[[Image:PrestonRoadNetwork.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Preston has an extensive road network, especially around the city centre.]]

In the 1980s, a motorway running around the west of the city which would have been an extension of the [[M65 motorway|M65]] running to the [[M55 motorway|M55]] was started but never finished. That is the reason that the M55 has no junction 2, because it was reserved for the new western bypass. However, the existing [[M6 motorway|M6]] between junctions 30 and 32 was widened extensively between 1993-95 to compensate for this. A new junction, 31A was opened in 1997 to serve a new business park close to the motorway.
As well as the M6 (North and South), there are 3 other motorways which terminate close to the city -

*M61 - Preston to Manchester via Chorley and Bolton
*M65 - Preston to Colne via Blackburn, Accrington and Burnley
*M55 - Preston to Blackpool via Kirkham

[[Image:Preston Station Front.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Preston railway station]]

===Rail===
[[Preston railway station]] is a major stop on the [[West Coast Main Line]], with regular long distance train services to [[London]] ([[Euston Railway Station|Euston]]) and the South East, and [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]] to the North.  Preston is also a hub for connecting rail services in the North West, with direct services to [[Blackpool]], [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], [[Blackburn]], [[Bradford]], [[Leeds]], [[Wigan]], [[Bolton]], [[Manchester]], [[Liverpool]] and [[Ormskirk]]. Overall, Preston has direct rail links to twelve cities across the UK; Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, York, Bradford, London, Carlisle, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Lancaster, Glasgow and Edinburgh. 

Preston once had lines to [[West Lancashire Railway|Southport]] and [[Preston and Longridge Railway|Longridge]] which closed to passengers in 1965 and 1930 respectively. The disused tracks of the Longridge line still exist as far as [[Deepdale, Preston|Deepdale]].

Preston is the home of the heritage [[Ribble Steam Railway]], located in [[Riversway]].

===Water===

The former Preston Port, known as Riversway or The Docks, has been the site of an expanding commercial and residential complex since 1988.

The Marina is just north of the River Ribble which enters into the east of the [[Irish Sea]]. This marina has its own chandlery and coffee shop, training courses and boat sales

There are multi-million pound plans to redevelop Preston's Docks (as well as large sections of the River Ribble running through the city) to introduce leisure facilities (ie watersports), new landmark buildings, a new central park opposite [[Avenham Park]], office and retail space, new residential developments and the re-opening of some of Preston's old canals. However, these plans, collectively known as [http://www.preston.gov.uk/category.asp?cat=785 Riverworks], have yet to undergo public consultation, and have already raised concerns amongst locals due to the potential loss of green space and increased risk of flooding.<ref>{{cite web | title=Flood plain housing plan slammed| work=Lancashire Evening Post, June 30th 2007 | url=http://www.lep.co.uk/news?articleid=2995255| accessdate=2007-07-01}}</ref>

=== Bus ===
[[Image:Preston bus 209.jpg|thumb|right|A Preston Bus service at [[Preston Bus Station]]]]
[[Image:Preston bus 63.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Preston Park & Ride]] service at [[The Harris Museum]]]]
Although lacking any rail based rapid transit network, Preston has a very comprehensive bus network. There are five main operators serving Preston.

[[Preston Bus]], formerly the city's [[municipal bus company]], serves the borough of Preston, and also operates a route between Preston and Penwortham. In October 2006, Preston Bus started operating the city's two new orbital bus routes.<ref>[http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/environment/bus/service_changes/Docs/oct06_temp.asp Lancashire County Council: Environment Directorate: Bus]</ref>

Many of the services between Preston and its surrounding area were operated by [[Ribble Motor Services]], now owned by [[Stagecoach Group]], using the name [[Stagecoach in Lancashire]]. Several of the company's routes are additionally branded as "Preston Citi"; these connect Preston to [[Penwortham]], [[Longton, Lancashire|Longton]], [[Fulwood, Lancashire|Fulwood]], [[Ribbleton]] and [[Longridge]]. Stagecoach also provide links to [[Walton-le-Dale]], [[Blackpool]], [[Blackburn]], [[Bolton]], [[Chorley]], [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]], as well as [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] and [[Morecambe]] under the [[Stagecoach in Lancaster]] service.

[[Preston Bus#Competition|Competition]] for routes and passengers resulted in a "[[Bus deregulation in Great Britain#Bus War|Bus War]]" between the two companies, since buses were [[Bus deregulation in Great Britain|deregulated]] in Great Britain.

[[John Fishwick & Sons]], provides frequent services into the city centre for Lower Penwortham, Lostock Hall, Leyland, Euxton and Chorley. [[Blue Bus of Penwortham]] is based in the [[South Ribble]] area with routes to Preston, Leyland, Chorley and Southport. [[Lancashire United]] operates two routes into Preston: one is the 152 to Blackburn and [[Burnley]]; the other is the 280 to [[Clitheroe]] and [[Skipton]].

Preston also has its own [[Preston Park & Ride|park and ride]] with two sites; one is at Portway, in the [[Riversway]] area, and the other is just off the [[A6 road (England)|A6]] at [[Walton-le-Dale]].

Preston also served by many national bus services. Stagecoach Express, National Express, Eurolines, and Megabus all have a large presence at [[Preston Bus Station]] - which is claimed to the largest or second largest station in Europe{{Fact|date=January 2009}}.

Preston was one of the first cities in the UK to have its bus network fitted with ''Realtime'',{{Fact|2009/01/09|date=January 2009}} a satellite based technology fitted to every bus stop which aims to provide an accurate time and destination of the next bus arriving using [[GPS tracking]]. This service was initially restricted to services within the borough, however, it has now been expanded to cover Fishwick's 111 City Centre/Leyland route due to its popularity.

=== Air ===
Although not a public airport; [[Warton Aerodrome]] is an active airfield west of the city and is the airfield for the BAE Warton factory. [[BAE Samlesbury]] to the east of the town is a former active aerodrome but today it serves as a facility for [[BAE Systems]]
:[[Blackpool International Airport]] is located only {{convert|20|mi|km}} west from the city.
:[[Manchester Airport]] is a large international airport about {{convert|40|mi|km}} south-east of the city.

==Education==
The city is home to the [[University of Central Lancashire]]. Formerly known as The Harris Institute, Preston [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|Polytechnic]], and more recently [1985 - 1992] as Lancashire Polytechnic, "UCLan" is now the sixth largest university in the country. The university currently has over 33,000 students.<ref>{{PDFlink|"[http://www.uclan.ac.uk/students/facts.pdf Pocket Facts]"|708&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 725307 bytes -->}}, University of Central Lancashire.
