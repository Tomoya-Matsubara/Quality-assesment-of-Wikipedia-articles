The '''USS ''Ferret''''' was a [[schooner]], the third U.S. navy vessel to bear this name, was purchased 20 December 1822 at Baltimore, Maryland and commissioned early in 1823, with [[Robert Henley (naval officer)|Lieutenant R. Henley]] in command. ''Ferret'' served transporting U.S. sailors and supplies and attacking pirate ships and pirate strongholds for a little more than two years when her career was cut short when she capsized in a gale storm off the coast of [[Cuba]].<ref name="DANFS">[[#DANFS|U.S. Naval Historical Center]], USS ''Ferret'': Page article</ref>

==Fighting piracy in the Caribbean==

The USS ''Ferret'' was part of a naval fleet that sailed to the [[Caribbean]] to subdue the occurrence of [[Piracy in the Caribbean|pirate raids]] on merchant ships that had increased to almost 3,000 by the early 1820s.<ref name="DANFS"/><ref name="DANFS2">[[#DANFS2|U.S. Naval Historical Center]], West Indian Pirates: Page article</ref> The financial losses to the United States was great while murder and the practice of torture were common.<ref name="DANFS"/><ref name="DANFS2"/> Loses to American ships and merchants had increased to such proportions that they along with the American public were now demanding that definite action be taken. In 1821 President [[James Monroe]] authorized the creation of the West Indies squadron for purposes of seeking and routing out pirates and their numerous strongholds about the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. Following Monroe's authorization Secretary of the Navy [[Smith Thompson]] appointed [[David Porter]] to take commanded of the squadron.<ref name="Konstam198">[[#Konstam07|Konstam, 2007]] p.198 </ref>

Under the leadership of Commodore Porter along with subordinate commanders [[James Biddle]] and [[Lewis Warrington]], the U.S. Navy's West India Squadron crushed the pirates who were relentlessly ferreted out from the uncharted bays and lagoons throughout the Caribbean by U.S. sailors and the [[West Indies Squadron (United States)|West Indies Squadron]] of which the USS ''Ferret'' played an important role. Within two years piracy was subdued and within ten years, piracy in the Caribbean was all but eradicated completely.<ref name="DANFS"/>

===''Ferret's'' role===
''Ferret'' sailed from [[Hampton Roads]] on  14 February 1823, bound for the [[West Indies]], and became part of the West Indies Squadron, also known as the ''Mosquito Fleet''. Smaller vessels like the ''Ferret'' were employed for the task because the larger [[Man-of-war]] ships were unable to pursue the typically smaller pirate vessels when they retreated into the many [[lagoon|lagoons]], rivers and creeks that were common to the numerous isles about the Caribbean.<ref>[[#Mahan|Mahan, 1892]] pp.63-64 </ref>

Porter's squadron consisted of sixteen vessels: eight new shallow draft schooners, five large [[barge]]s, a steam powered [[riverboat]] and a [[storeship]] schooner and a decoy merchant ship that concealed several large guns. The newly acquired schooners were each armed with three guns and given the names USS ''Ferret'', [[USS Beagle (1822)|USS ''Beagle'']], [[USS Fox|USS ''Fox'']], [[USS Greyhound (1822)|USS ''Greyhound'']], [[USS Jackal (1822)|USS ''Jackal'']], [[USS Terrier (1822)|USS ''Terrier'']], [[USS Weasel (1822)|USS ''Weasel'']], and the [[USS Wild Cat|USS ''Wild Cat'']]. The first day out the fleet encountered a northeasterly gale forcing the fleet to hold up at the naval base at [[Key West]].<ref>[[#Farragut79|Farragut, 1879]] pp.90-91</ref> The Key West base was chosen as the base of operation because of its central location in pirate waters.<ref name="Konstam198"/>

Along with convoying merchantmen, ''Ferret'' engaged a pirate barge and seven boats in Bacuna Yeauga bay in a Cuba on 18 June 1823. During the battle the vessel received a small boat hole at the water line by a buccaneer's musket ball, Consequently Ferret had to break off the attack, since a high wind and heavy sea prevented her from entering the channel. Seeking aid ''Ferret'' retreated to sea returning the next day with a boat loaned by a nearby British ship, only to find that the governor of the province had already dispersed the pirates.<ref name="DANFS"/> 

[[David Farragut]], a Lieutenant, at the age of 23, took command of the ''Ferret'' later in the summer of 1823, it was his first command of a naval ship. Under Farragut, the ''Ferret'' brought men and supplies into the points on the north coast of Cuba.<ref>[[#Farragut79|Farragut, 1879]] p.100</ref><ref>[[#Mahan|Mahan, 1892]] p.64</ref><ref>[[#Porter1875|Porter, 1875]] p.295</ref>

On 4 February 1825, under the command of [[Charles H. Bell (naval officer)|Charles H. Bell]] while on patrol off Cuba, ''Ferret'' capsized at sea in a gale and heavy seas, about 8 miles off the port of Canasi. Commander Bell (and other survivors) remained with the capsized vessel for twenty-one hours before being rescued by ''Jackal''. Five crew members perished during the storm.<ref name="DANFS"/><ref>[[#Spears|Spears, 1905]] p.127 </ref><ref>[[#Bradlee|Bradlee, 1923]] p.129</ref>
