'''John Joseph Lipon''' ([[November 10]], [[1922]] - [[August 17]], [[1998]]) was a Major League shortstop for the [[Detroit Tigers]], [[Boston Red Sox]], [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]], and the [[Cincinnati Reds]], USA, over the course of 12 seasons.  Like many at his position, he was never known for his power, but he wasn't an exceptional fielder, either.  One of the most memorable moments of his playing career was in [[1951 in baseball|1951]], when [[Bob Feller]] of the [[Cleveland Indians|Indians]] threw his third career no-hitter, but lost the shutout when Lipon reached on an error, stole second base, advanced to third on an errant pickoff throw, and scored on a sacrifice fly.

In [[1952 in baseball|1952]], he was part of a trade to the Red Sox that included longtime star [[Johnny Pesky]] going to the Tigers.  His playing time diminished, and in the [[1953 in baseball|1953]] season, he was sold to the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]].  In [[1954 in baseball|1954]], the Browns moved east to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], but Lipon was quickly traded to the [[Chicago White Sox]].  Before playing a game for the White Sox, however, he was traded to the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. He had one [[National League]] at-bat before he was farmed to the new Cuban Sugar Kings. He played in the high minors several years, evolving into a player/coach.

In [[1959 in baseball|1959]], Lipon moved to the minors as a manager, beginning at the Class D level with [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]] of the [[Alabama-Florida League]]. Lipon spent 30 of the next 34 years as a manager in the Cleveland, Detroit and [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] [[farm system]]s, winning 2,185 games and losing 1,987 (.524). In 1961, he managed the [[Toronto Maple Leafs (minor league baseball)|Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[International League]]. His success as skipper of the AAA [[Portland Beavers]] in the mid-1960s earned him a promotion to the Indians' coaching staff, where he served from 1968-71.

Many expected Lipon to be a manager at the major league level, but his only chance came during the [[1971 in baseball|1971]] season, when Cleveland fired [[Alvin Dark]] with 59 games left. But the Indians went only 18-41 (.305) under Lipon, good for last place in the [[American League East]], 43 games behind the [[Baltimore Orioles]].  He returned to managing the next season, with the [[Toledo Mud Hens]] of the AAA [[International League]].

Lipon retired from managing after the 1992 season. His last club, the [[Lakeland Tigers]] of the [[Florida State League]], won its division's second-half championship. He died in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] at age 75.
