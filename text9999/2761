'''''Pola''''' was a {{sclass-|Zara|cruiser|0}} [[heavy cruiser]] of the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Royal Navy). She was built in the [[Odero-Terni-Orlando shipyard]] in [[Livorno]] in the early 1930s and entered service in 1932. She was the third of four ships in the class, which also included {{ship|Italian cruiser|Zara||2}}, {{ship|Italian cruiser|Fiume||2}}, and {{ship|Italian cruiser|Gorizia||2}}. ''Pola'' was built as a [[flagship]] with a larger [[conning tower]] to accommodate an admiral's staff. Like her sisters, she was armed with a battery of eight {{convert|203|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} guns and was capable of a top speed of {{convert|32|kn}}. 

''Pola'' initially served as the flagship of the 2nd Squadron, and in 1940 she led the squadron during the battles of [[Battle of Calabria|Calabria]] and [[Battle of Cape Spartivento|Cape Spartivento]], in July and November, respectively. During the latter engagement she briefly battled the British cruiser {{HMS|Berwick|65|6}}. ''Pola'' was thereafter reassigned to the 3rd Division, along with her three sister ships. The ship took part in the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] in late March 1941. During the battle, she was disabled by a British airstrike. Later, in a fierce night engagement in the early hours of 29 March, ''Pola'', ''Zara'', ''Fiume'', and two [[destroyer]]s were sunk by the British [[Mediterranean Fleet]] with heavy loss of life.

==Design==
{{main|Zara-class cruiser}}

''Pola'' was {{convert|182.8|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|20.62|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|7.2|m|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|13944|LT|sp=us}} at full load, though her displacement was nominally within the {{convert|10000|LT|adj=on}} restriction set in place by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]]. Her power plant consisted of two [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]]s powered by eight oil-fired [[Yarrow boiler]]s, which were trunked into two funnels [[amidships]]. Her engines were rated at {{convert|95000|shp|lk=in}} and produced a top speed of {{convert|32|kn|lk=in}}. She had a crew of 841 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=GC292>Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 292</ref> ''Pola'' was designed to function as a squadron [[flagship]], and so her forward [[superstructure]] was larger than that of her sisters, and was faired into the forward funnel.<ref name=B76/>

She was protected with a [[belt armor|armored belt]] that was {{convert|150|mm|abbr=on}} thick amidships. Her armor deck was {{convert|70|mm|abbr=on}} thick in the central portion of the ship and reduced to {{convert|20|mm|abbr=on}} at either end. The gun turrets had 150&nbsp;mm thick plating on the faces and the [[barbette]]s they sat in were also 150&nbsp;mm thick. The main conning tower had 150&nbsp;mm thick sides.<ref name=GC292/>

''Pola'' was armed with a main battery of eight [[203 mm /53 Italian naval gun|{{convert|203|mm|abbr=on}} Mod 29]] 53-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] guns in four [[gun turret]]s. The turrets were arranged in [[superfire|superfiring pairs]] forward and aft. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by a battery of sixteen {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} 47-cal. guns in twin mounts, four {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} guns in single mounts and eight {{convert|12.7|mm|abbr=on}} guns in twin mounts. She carried a pair of [[IMAM Ro.43]] [[seaplane]]s for aerial reconnaissance; the hangar was located in under the [[forecastle]] and a fixed [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] was mounted on the [[:wikt:centerline|centerline]] at the bow.<ref name=GC292/><ref name=B76>Brescia, p. 76</ref>

''Pola''{{'}}s secondary battery was revised several times during her career. Two of the 100&nbsp;mm guns and all of the 40&nbsp;mm and 12.7&nbsp;mm guns were removed in the late 1930s and eight {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on}} 54-cal. guns and eight {{convert|13.2|mm|abbr=on}} guns were installed in their place. Two {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} 15-cal. [[starshell]] guns were added in 1940.<ref name=GC292/>

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2008-0214-500, Golf von Neapel, Italienische Kreuzer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''Pola'' (third from right) along with ''Zara'' and ''Fiume'' in Naples in 1938]]
''Pola'', named for the [[Pula|eponymous city]] seized by Italy after [[World War I]], was laid down at the [[Odero-Terni-Orlando shipyard]] in [[Livorno]] on 17 March 1931 and was launched on 5 December that year. [[Fitting-out]] work proceeded quickly, and the new cruiser entered service just over a year later on 21 December 1932.<ref name=B76/> ''Pola'' participated in a naval review in the [[Gulf of Naples]], where she hosted Italy's [[fascism|fascist]] dictator, [[Benito Mussolini]], on 6&ndash;7 July 1933. On 29 July 1934 she was formally given her [[War flag|battle flag]] in a ceremony in her namesake city. On 3 September 1936 she left [[Gaeta]], bound for Spanish waters; she thereafter began a [[Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War|non-intervention]] patrol during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. From 10 September to 3 October, she was stationed in [[Palma de Mallorca]] to safeguard Italian interests there. ''Pola'' returned to Gaeta on 4 October.<ref name=HW54>Hogg & Wiper, p. 54</ref>

''Pola'' went on a short cruise to [[Italian Libya]] on 10&ndash;12 March 1937, with Mussolini and [[Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi|Prince Luigi Amedeo]] aboard. On 7 June, she took part in a naval review in the Gulf of Naples held for the visiting German Field Marshal [[Werner von Blomberg]]. Another review took place on 5 May 1938 when the German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] made a state visit to Italy.<ref name=HW54/> On 7 March 1939, ''Pola'' and her sisterships sortied from [[Taranto]] to intercept a squadron of [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] warships&mdash;three cruisers and eight [[destroyer]]s&mdash;attempting to reach the [[Black Sea]]. The Italian ships were ordered not to open fire but merely to try to impede the progress of the Spanish ships and force them to dock at [[Augusta, Sicily]]. The Spanish commander refused and instead steamed to [[Bizerte]] in French Tunisia, where his ships were interned.<ref>Hogg & Wiper, p. 18</ref> The next month, on 7&ndash;9 April, ''Pola'' provided gunfire support to Italian forces occupying [[Albania]].<ref name=HW54/>

===World War II===
At Italy's entrance into the Second World War on 10 June 1940, ''Pola'' was assigned as the [[flagship]] of Admiral [[Riccardo Paladini]], commander of the 2nd Squadron, which also included the three {{sclass-|Trento|cruiser|1}}s in the 2nd Division, three [[light cruiser]]s in the 7th Division, and seventeen [[destroyer]]s.<ref>Brescia, pp. 42&ndash;43</ref> ''Pola''{{'}}s first wartime operation was to cover a group of minelayers on the night of 10&ndash;11 June.<ref>Rohwer, p. 26</ref> She refueled at [[Messina]] and departed on 12 June,<ref name=HW54/> along with the rest of the 2nd Squadron and the 1st Squadron. The ships sortied in response to British attacks on Italian positions in [[Libya]].<ref>Rohwer, p. 28</ref> On 6 July, ''Pola'' and the rest of the 2nd Squadron escorted a convoy bound for North Africa; the following day, Italian reconnaissance reported a British cruiser squadron to have arrived in [[Malta]]. The Italian naval high command therefore ordered several other cruisers and destroyers from the 1st Squadron to join the escort for the convoy. The [[battleship]]s {{ship|Italian battleship|Conte di Cavour||2}} and {{ship|Italian battleship|Giulio Cesare||2}} provided distant support. Two days later, the Italian battleships briefly clashed with the British [[Mediterranean Fleet]] in an [[Battle of Calabria|inconclusive action off Calabria]].<ref>Rohwer, p. 32</ref> During the action, ''Pola'' engaged British cruisers but neither side scored any hits. From 30 July to 1 August, ''Pola'', {{ship|Italian cruiser|Trento||2}}, and {{ship|Italian cruiser|Gorizia||2}} escorted a convoy to Libya. On 16 August she conducted live fire training off [[Naples]], and at the end of the month she was transferred from Naples to Taranto.<ref name=HW54/> 

In late September, the Italian fleet, including ''Pola'', made a sweep for a British troop convoy from [[Alexandria]] to Malta, but it made no contact with the British ships.<ref>Rohwer, p. 43</ref> On 1 November, Mussolini visited the ship in Taranto.<ref name=HW54/> ''Pola'' was present in the harbor at Taranto when the British fleet launched the nighttime carrier [[Battle of Taranto|strike on Taranto]] on the night of 11&ndash;12 November, but she was not attacked in the raid.<ref>Lowry & Wellham, p. 119</ref> She and the rest of the fleet left for Naples the following morning.<ref name=HW54/> Another attempt to intercept a British convoy in late November resulted in the [[Battle of Cape Spartivento]]. The Italian fleet left port on 26 November and while en route to the British fleet, ''Pola'' and the battleship {{ship|Italian battleship|Vittorio Veneto||2}} were attacked by [[Fairey Swordfish|Swordfish]] [[torpedo bomber]]s from the carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}}, but both ships evaded the torpedoes. The two fleets then clashed in an engagement that lasted for about an hour.<ref name=R50/> During the brief action, ''Pola'' scored two hits on the British cruiser {{HMS|Berwick|65|6}} and disabled one of her main battery turrets.<ref>Brescia, p. 77</ref> Campioni broke off the action because he mistakenly believed he was facing a superior force, the result of poor aerial reconnaissance.<ref name=R50>Rohwer, p. 50</ref> 

The Italian fleet was reorganized on 9 December, and ''Pola'' joined her three [[sister ship]]s in the 3rd Division of the 1st Squadron, which was now commanded by Admiral [[Angelo Iachino]].<ref>Rohwer, p. 51</ref> On 14 December, a British air raid on [[Naples]] slightly damaged ''Pola''.<ref>Rohwer, p. 52</ref> Two bombs hit the ship, both [[amidships]] on the port side. The hits damaged three of the ship's boilers and caused significant flooding and a significant list to port.<ref name=HW54/> ''Pola'' was drydocked on 16 December for repair work that lasted until 7 February 1941. She returned to Taranto on 13 February, and she joined ''Zara'' and ''Fiume'' for extensive maneuvers off Taranto on 11&ndash;17 March. A nighttime training operation followed on 23&ndash;24 March.<ref name=HW54/>

====Battle of Cape Matapan====
[[File:Www2mR130BMatapan.GIF|thumb|Map of the movements of the Italian and British fleets during the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]]]]

The Italian fleet made another attempt to intercept a British convoy in the eastern Mediterranean south of [[Crete]] in late March. This operation resulted in the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] on 27&ndash;29 March. For most of the daytime engagement, ''Pola'' and the rest of the 3rd Division were stationed on the disengaged side the Italian fleet, and so did not see action during this phase. ''Vittorio Veneto'' was torpedoed by British aircraft from the carrier {{HMS|Formidable|R67|2}} and was forced to withdraw, and the 3rd Division remained on the port side of the Italian fleet to screen against another possible British attack.<ref>Bennett, pp. 121&ndash;124</ref> A second British airstrike later in the day failed to locate the retiring ''Vittorio Veneto'' and instead scored a single torpedo strike on ''Pola'', hitting her [[amidships]] on her starboard side. In the confusion of the attack, ''Pola'' had nearly collided with ''Fiume'' and had been forced to stop, which had prevented her from taking evasive action.<ref>O'Hara, p. 91</ref> The damage filled three compartments with water and disabled five of her boilers and the main steam line that fed the turbines, leaving her immobilized.<ref>Stephen, p. 61</ref><ref>O'Hara, p. 91</ref>

Iachino was unaware of ''Pola''{{'}}s plight until 20:10 on 28 March; upon learning of the situation he detached ''Fiume'', ''Zara'', and four destroyers to protect ''Pola''. At around the same time, the British cruiser {{HMS|Orion|85|6}} detected ''Pola'' on her radar and reported her location.<ref>O'Hara, p. 92</ref> The British fleet, centered on the battleships {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}}, {{HMS|Warspite|03|2}}, and {{HMS|Barham|04|2}}, was at this point only {{convert|50|nmi|abbr=on}} away.<ref>Smith, p. 138</ref> The British ships, guided by radar, closed in on the Italians; at 22:10, ''Pola'' was about {{convert|6|nmi}} from ''Valiant''. Lookouts on the Italian cruiser spotted shapes approaching and assumed them to be friendly vessels, so they fired a red flare to guide them. Almost twenty minutes later, the British illuminated first ''Zara'' and then ''Fiume'' with their searchlights; the British battleships obliterated ''Fiume'', ''Zara'', and two destroyers in a point-blank engagement.<ref>O'Hara, pp. 93&ndash;94</ref>

''Pola'' initially was left alone during the action, and her captain, assuming that his ship would be the next target, ordered his crew to open the [[seacock]]s and abandon ship.<ref name=OH97>O'Hara, p. 97</ref> About ten minutes after midnight, the destroyer {{HMS|Havock|H43|2}} discovered ''Pola'', still without power, in the darkness. A flotilla of British destroyers rushed to the scene, first discovering the abandoned ''Zara'', which was still afloat; she was torpedoed and sunk by the destroyer {{HMS|Jervis||2}}. After picking up survivors, the destroyers joined ''Havock'' and a boarding party was prepared to take ''Pola'', though it was discovered that most of her crew had jumped into the water, and the remaining men were huddled on the forecastle, ready to surrender. ''Jervis'' took off the surviving 22&nbsp;officers and 236&nbsp;enlisted men from ''Pola''. Then the destroyer {{HMS|Nubian|F36|6}} torpedoed the ship while ''Jervis'' illuminated her with her searchlights. ''Pola''{{'}}s magazines exploded and she sank at 04:03 on 29 March.<ref>Rohwer, p. 66</ref><ref>Bennett, pp. 129&ndash;131</ref> A total of 328 men went down with the ship.<ref name=OH97/> ''Pola'' was formally stricken from the [[naval register]] on 18 October 1946.<ref name=HW54/>
