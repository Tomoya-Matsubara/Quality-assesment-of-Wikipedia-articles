The '''Pixies''' are an [[United States|American]] [[alternative rock]] [[Band (music)|band]] formed in {{city-state|Boston|Massachusetts}} in 1985.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=Bbx68mpm39f5o | title=Pixies | author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas, ''[[All Music Guide]]'' | accessdate=2005-09-10}}</ref> The band disbanded in 1993 in acrimonious circumstances but reunited in 2004. [[Frank Black|Black Francis]], [[Joey Santiago]], [[Kim Deal]], and [[Dave Lovering]] have been the band's continual members. The Pixies found only modest success in their home country, but were significantly more successful in the [[United Kingdom]] and elsewhere in [[Europe]], although never achieving mainstream success with their studio albums.<ref name="American alt-rock">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=19:T578 | title=American Alternative Rock/Post-Punk | author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas, ''[[All Music Guide]]'' | accessdate=2006-05-20}}</ref>

The Pixies' music was heavily influenced by [[punk rock|punk]] and [[surf rock]], and while highly melodic, was  capable of being tremendously abrasive at the same time. Francis was the band's primary [[songwriter]] and singer and had a distinctly desperate, yowling delivery. He typically wrote cryptic songs about offbeat subjects, such as [[unidentified flying objects|UFOs]] and [[surrealism]].<ref name="ufo">Francis, Black. Lyrics.

The group is frequently posited as the immediate forebearer of the alternative rock boom of the early 1990s, though they disbanded before reaping any of the benefits this might have brought them.<ref name="allmusic-bio">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:bx68mpm39f5o~T1 | title=Pixies > Biography | accessdate=2006-09-10 | author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/rockandalt/reviews/pixies_mutilation.shtml | title=Rock & Alt Review - The Pixies - Wave of Mutilation | accessdate=2006-10-18 | author=Jacqueline Hodges, [[BBC]] | date=2004-05-03 | quote=Then along came the Surfer Rosa album where, without realising it at the time, a pre-[[Nevermind]] Steve Albini produced the blueprint for grunge and a legend was born.}}</ref> Avowed fan [[Kurt Cobain]]'s acknowledgement of the debt [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] owed to the Pixies,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.4ad.com/pixies/ephemera/kurt-cobain-on-p/ | title=Kurt Cobain on Pixies and The Breeders | accessdate=2006-09-02 | author=Melody Maker | date=1992-08-29}}</ref> along with similar tributes by other alternative bands, ensured that the Pixies' legacy and influence grew substantially in the years following their demise.<ref name="theysaid">{{cite web | url=http://aleceiffel.free.fr/misc_said.html | title=They Said About the Pixies... | accessdate=2006-09-11 | author=Jean-Michel Biel, Christophe Gourraud}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://aleceiffel.free.fr/misc_homages.html | title=Homages to the Pixies | accessdate=2006-08-28 | author=Jean-Michel Biel, Christophe Gourraud}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation===
The Pixies' history began when undergraduates Joey Santiago and Black Francis (born Charles Thompson IV) shared a room at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]].<ref>The university was the theme of the song, "U-Mass", on ''[[Trompe le Monde]]''</ref> Santiago soon introduced Francis to the music of [[David Bowie]] and 1970s [[punk rock]], and the pair began to jam together.<ref name="officialprofile">{{cite web | url=http://www.4ad.com/pixies/profile/ | title=Pixies Profile | author=4AD | accessdate=2006-08-13}}</ref> Francis then embarked on a student exchange trip to {{city-state|San Juan|Puerto Rico}}, but upon arriving struggled to grasp the [[Spanish language]].<ref>His Spanish later improved, and several Pixies songs contained Spanish lyrics, most notably in ''Come On Pilgrim''</ref> After spending six months in an apartment with a "weirdo, psycho, gay roommate",<ref>The unnamed roommate in question was the subject of a later song, "[[Crackity Jones]]", from ''Doolittle''.</ref> he returned to Boston and dropped out of the university with Santiago to form a band.<ref name="officialprofile" /><ref>Sisario, Ben. ''Doolittle 33<U+2153>''. Continuum, 2006. ISBN 0-8264-1774-4 p. 12-13</ref>

Bassist Kim Deal later joined Santiago and Francis after responding to a classified advertisement Francis had placed, seeking a female bassist who liked both [[folk music]] icons [[Peter, Paul and Mary]] and the [[hardcore punk]] band [[H<U+00FC>sker D<U+00FC>]].<ref>Frank, Josh; Ganz, Caryn. "[[Fool the World: The Oral History of a Band Called Pixies]]." (2006). ISBN 0-312-34007-9. p. 14</ref> Deal was the only person to respond, but arrived at the audition without a [[bass guitar]] as she had never played the instrument before.<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 15</ref><ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 14</ref> She claimed her twin sister [[Kelley Deal]] had a bass back in Dayton and that she had no money to get it. Francis lent her $50 for the airfare and Deal returned with the bass guitar.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://aleceiffel.free.fr/history.html | title = A Pixies History | accessdate=2006-08-29 | author=Jean-Michel Biel, Christophe Gourraud}}</ref> 

After recruiting Kim Deal, the band tried to get Kelley to join the band on drums unsuccessfully. Kim's husband suggested that they pick up drummer David Lovering, whom Kim had met at her wedding reception.<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 18</ref><ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 8-9</ref> They arrived at a name after Santiago selected the word randomly from a dictionary and took a liking to the definition, "mischievous little [[elves]]".<ref name="officialprofile" /> The group was originally named "Pixies In Panoply" ("Things on Fire" was considered),<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 21</ref> but soon shortened it to "Pixies".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dag.wieers.com/debaser/trivia.php | title=Pixies/Debaser <U+2014> Trivia | author=Dag Wie<U+00EB>rs | accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref><ref name="titles">{{cite web | url=http://aleceiffel.free.fr/titles.html | title=Pixies Titles/Names | accessdate=2006-09-18 | author=Jean-Michel Biel, Christophe Gourraud}}</ref>

Once the band had settled on a stable line-up, they started rehearsing in late 1985 in Deal's apartment, later moving rehearsals to Lovering's parents' garage in the summer of 1986.<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 9</ref><ref>Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 20</ref> Their first show <U+2014> named as "possibly the worst gig in the history of rock" by the band <U+2014> took place at the [[The Rathskeller]], Boston, where they performed early versions of "[[Here Comes Your Man]]", "[[Dig for Fire]]", and "Build High".<ref name="officialprofile" />

===Record contract and ''Come On Pilgrim''===
While the Pixies were playing a concert with [[Throwing Muses]], they were noticed by producer [[Gary Smith (record producer)|Gary Smith]] ([[Fort Apache Studios]]).  He told the band that he "could not sleep until you guys are world famous."<ref name="officialprofile" /><ref>Gary Smith wrote a retrospect for the liner notes of the ''[[Death to the Pixies]]'' compilation</ref> The band produced an 18 track demo at Fort Apache soon afterwards, known to fans as "[[The Purple Tape]]" because of the tape cover's purple background.<ref>The official profile states 18 tracks were recorded, but only 17 are printed on the Purple Tape</ref> The recording was funded by Francis' father at the cost of $1000 and took three days to record.<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 16</ref> The [[Compact Cassette|tape]] was released exclusively as a demo to interested parties, including [[Ivo Watts-Russell]] at [[4AD]] and local promoter Ken Goes, who became the band's manager.<ref name="officialprofile" /> Watts-Russell nearly passed on the band, finding them too normal, "too rock 'n' roll", but signed them at the persuasion of his girlfriend.<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 17</ref><ref>An album was later released, entitled ''[[Pixies (album)|Pixies]]'', containing the songs from the Purple Tape that were not later released on ''Come on Pilgrim''. ''Pixies'' also contained a new track, "Rock A My Soul", which was never released on any album.</ref>

[[Image:Come_on_pilgrim.jpg|thumb|left|[[Come on Pilgrim]] (1987)]]
Upon signing with 4AD (the band later claimed they were "the coolest record company to pay on time"),<ref name="officialprofile" /> eight tracks from the Purple Tape were selected for the ''[[Come on Pilgrim]]'' EP, the band's first release. The title was a lyric in the song "Levitate Me", which came from a catchphrase used by '70s Christian rock pioneer  [[Larry Norman]] during his live concerts: "Come on Pilgrim, you know He loves you"<ref name="officialprofile" /> <U+2014> Francis once saw Norman at a Christian [[summer camp]].<ref name="titles" /> Black Francis would later record one of Norman's songs during his solo career as Frank Black, plus share one concert stage with Norman.

In the EP, Francis drew upon his experiences in [[Puerto Rico]], mostly in the songs "Vamos" and "Isla de Encanta";<ref>"Isla de Encanta" is an alteration of the island's nickname, "Isla del Encanto" ("Isle of Enchantment").</ref> the album included lyrics describing the poverty in [[Puerto Rico]]. The religious lyrics in ''Come on Pilgrim'' and later albums came from his [[born-again Christian]] days in the Pentecostal Church.

''Come on Pilgrim'' showcased much of the Pixies' variety and set up the beginnings of many trends in their music. It includes two songs partly sung in Spanish ("Vamos" and "Isla de Encanta") and two songs that explicitly mention incest <U+2014> "Nimrod's Son" and "The Holiday Song" ({{audio|HolidaySong.ogg|sample}}). "[[I've Been Tired]]" refers metaphorically to sex and [[rock and roll]] culture and features a weird sense of humour, and there are three songs with religious references ("Caribou", "Nimrod's Son", and "The Holiday Song"). Beyond lyrical trends, ''Come on Pilgrim'' displayed Santiago's erratic leads (as best displayed in "Vamos"), Kim Deal's sweet harmonies (the then-married Deal used the [[pseudonym]] "Mrs. John Murphy" on the first few Pixies records, as an ironic feminist joke), and Black Francis's amazing [[vocal range]], from screaming to simple, traditional sung melodies.<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 18</ref>

===''Surfer Rosa'' and ''Doolittle''===
[[Image:SurferRosa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Surfer Rosa]] (1988)]]
''Come on Pilgrim'' was followed by the band's first full-length album, ''[[Surfer Rosa]]''. The album was recorded by [[Steve Albini]] (who was hired by Watts-Russell on the advice of a 4AD colleague),<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 75</ref> completed in a fortnight, and released in early 1988. Steve Albini later became notable for recording [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[In Utero]]'' at the request of Kurt Cobain, who had cited ''Surfer Rosa'' as one of his main musical influences, and particularly admired the album's natural and powerful drum sounds <U+2014> a result of Albini's influence on the record.<ref>Azerrad, Michael. ''Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana''. Doubleday, 1993. ISBN 0-385-47199-8, p. 313</ref> ''Surfer Rosa'' gained the Pixies acclaim throughout the musical world; both ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' gave ''Surfer Rosa'' their "Album of the Year" award.<ref name="officialprofile" /> The success of ''Surfer Rosa'' would lead to the band signing a American distribution deal with major record label [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] before the release of their next album.

As with ''Come on Pilgrim'', the band delivered a wide range of song styles. However, sonically and thematically, ''Surfer Rosa'' was similar to ''Come On Pilgrim'' <U+2014> from the drum-driven "Bone Machine", that showed a trademark propensity for surreal lyrics,<ref>Francis, Black. Lyrics. "[http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=43086 Bone Machine]." ''[[Surfer Rosa]]''. [[Gramophone record|LP]]. [[4AD Records|4AD]] 1988.</ref> to pop guitar songs such as "Broken Face",<ref>"Broken Face" is another Spanish-themed song, with erratic lead guitar from Santiago and pseudo-falsetto vocals from Francis present in the song</ref> "Break My Body", and "Brick is Red". The band included heavier material, such as "Something Against You", with Black Francis' distorted screaming a prominent feature in the song, and [[Q Magazine]] later named ''Surfer Rosa'' as one of the ''50 Heaviest Albums of All Time''.<ref name="qmag">{{cite web | url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlistspage2.html | title=A Selection of Lists From Q Magazine | accessdate=2006-08-11 | author=Julian White and Q Magazine}}</ref> A re-recorded version of "Vamos" <U+2014> a song that appeared on ''Come on Pilgrim'' <U+2014> appears on the album. The track, "You Fuckin' Die! (I Said)" (referred to as "Bonus Track" or "Untitled" on most versions of the CD) that appears toward the end of the album is actually an accidental studio recording of Francis and Deal talking amicably and joking, and despite the title of the song, there is none of the tension present between the two that would later drive the band apart.

''Surfer Rosa'' featured popular songs such as "[[Gigantic (song)|Gigantic]]" <U+2014> their first single release and one of the few songs on which bassist Kim Deal sang lead vocals<ref>However, "Gigantic" failed to chart in the USA, and only reached #92 in the UK</ref> &ndash; "River Euphrates", and "[[Where Is My Mind?]]" ({{audio|WhereIsMyMind.ogg|sample}}), whose most famous performance was at the end of the film ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'', and, as a result is one of their best-known songs to date.

After their critically acclaimed album, the band arrived in [[England]] to support Throwing Muses on the European "Sex and Death" tour &mdash; beginning at the [[Mean Fiddler]] in [[London]].<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 94</ref> The setlist included new songs such as "In Heaven", "Hey", and "Wild Honey Pie", and the tour become notable for the band's [[in-joke]]s, such as playing their entire [[set list]] in alphabetical order.<ref name="allmusic-bio" /> The aforementioned songs were recorded in a [[Peel session]] in July at the BBC and they soon made a second trip to the studios; choosing "Dead", "Tame", "There Goes My Gun", and "Manta Ray" to be recorded. In total, the band recorded six Peel sessions and released an album, ''[[Pixies at the BBC]]'', with selected recorded tracks from those sessions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://aleceiffel.free.fr/sessions.html | title=Pixies Radio 1 Sessions | accessdate=2006-09-02 | author=Jean-Michel Biel, Christophe Gourraud}} Note the webpage was written before the release of ''[[Pixies at the BBC]]''.</ref>

[[Image:Pixies-Doolittle.jpg|thumb|left|[[Doolittle (album)|Doolittle]] (1989)]]

Around this time, the Pixies struck up a relationship with the British producer, [[Gil Norton]]. Norton was to produce their second full album, ''[[Doolittle (album)|Doolittle]]'' (provisionally titled ''Whore''),<ref name="officialprofile" /> which was recorded in the last six weeks of 1988 and seen as a departure from the raw sound of ''Come on Pilgrim'' and ''Surfer Rosa''. ''Doolittle'' had a much cleaner sound, largely due to Norton and the production budget of [[United States dollar|US$]]40,000, which was quadruple that of ''Surfer Rosa''.<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 47</ref> Much of the album's subject matter remained similar to the previous two albums; several song titles seemed to invoke images of bloodshed and mutilation, such as "I Bleed", "Wave of Mutilation", and "Gouge Away".

''Doolittle'' began with "[[Debaser]]" ({{audio-nohelp|Debaser.ogg|sample}}), an ode to the 1929 [[surrealist]] [[Luis Bu<U+00F1>uel]] and [[Salvador Dal<U+00ED>]] film ''[[Un chien andalou]]''. "Debaser" is perhaps their most highly regarded song; in March 2005, [[Q magazine|''Q'' magazine]] placed the song at number 21 in its list of the ''100 Greatest Guitar Tracks''. ''Doolittle'' featured the prominent single "[[Here Comes Your Man]]"; an unusually jaunty and poppy song for the band.<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 118-9</ref> It nearly landed the band a mimed appearance on the TV [[Talk show|chat show]] ''[[Wogan]]'', which was mocked in the video to the song.<ref>In the video to "Here Comes Your Man", the band open their mouths while the vocals on the song are being sung</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.4ad.com/pixies/profile/?page=2 | title=4AD <U+2014> Pixies Profile Page 2 | accessdate=2006-08-31 | author=4AD}}</ref> "[[Monkey Gone to Heaven]]", the only Pixies song with a  string section,  was a Top 10 hit in the [[UK]], reached the Top 100 in [[North America]] and still receives regular radio play. Deal's only songwriting contribution to the album was the song "Silver" (co-written with Francis), in which Deal played [[slide guitar]] and Lovering played the [[bass guitar]].<ref>Deal was credited for the first time as "Kim Deal" on ''Doolittle''</ref> Lovering sang lead vocals on "La La Love You", an atypical love song from the band.

Like ''Surfer Rosa'', ''Doolittle'' was critically acclaimed by fans and [[music critic]]s alike, and it is perhaps their best-selling record; it was [[Music recording sales certification|certified gold]] by the [[RIAA]] on November 10, 1995.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/default.asp | title=RIAA - Gold and Platinum searchable database | accessdate=2006-09-17}}</ref> {{RS500|226}}<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939357/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time | title=The RS 500 Greatest Albums of All Time | author=Rolling Stone Magazine | accessdate=2006-08-23 | date=2003-11-18}}</ref> and placed on Q Magazine's 100 Greatest Albums Ever.<ref name="qmag" />

===Hiatus===
It was after ''Doolittle'' that tensions between Deal and Francis came to a head (for example, Francis threw a guitar at Deal during a concert in Stuttgart),<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 132</ref> and Deal was almost fired from the band. Santiago, in an interview to ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'', explained:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://aleceiffel.free.fr/hello_g.html | title=HELLO GOODBYE 9: JOEY SANTIAGO & THE PIXIES | accessdate=2006-09-12}}</ref>

{{cquote|Kim was headstrong and wanted to include her own songs, to explore her own world. The way I think Charles [Black Francis] saw it, the band made pizzas, not cookies. Before we made ''Bossanova'', we were even going to fire her, after a gig in Frankfurt, where we found her hanging out in her hotel room, with no intention of playing. But our lawyer convinced us to try and work it out, to give her a warning or something. You know, I blocked that incident out of my head, that was too heavy for me. Kim couldn't believe I'd be party to it but I told her, she didn't seem happy, so why hang around? In the end, Kim realised it was Charles's bag, that he was the singer, but they kinda stopped talking after that.}}

During the post-''Doolittle'' "Fuck or Fight" tour of the United States, intended to promote the release of the album, the band's hectic schedule (the Pixies had released three albums in two years, as well as constant touring) took its toll on the band members. Near the end of the 1989 tour, in their homecoming concert in Boston, Deal was in a drunken state and Santiago smashed up his instruments and stormed off-stage. On the final tour date (in [[New York]]), the band was too exhausted to attend the end-of-tour party the next night and soon announced a [[hiatus]].<ref name="allmusic-bio" />

During this time, Santiago travelled to the [[Grand Canyon]] to "find himself", and Lovering jetted off to [[Jamaica]]. Francis bought a yellow [[Cadillac]] and crossed America with his girlfriend, and while doing so performed solo gigs in order to raise money for furniture in his new [[Los Angeles]] apartment. Deal formed a new band, [[The Breeders]] (named after a band she had formed with her sister as a teenager) with [[Tanya Donelly]] of [[Throwing Muses]] and bassist [[Josephine Wiggs]] of [[Perfect Disaster]]. Their debut album, ''[[Pod (album)|Pod]]'', was released later that year.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.4ad.com/pixies/profile/?page=3 | title=4AD <U+2014> Pixies Profile (page 3) | accessdate=2006-08-31}}</ref>

===''Bossanova'' and ''Trompe le Monde''===
[[Image:Pixies-Bossanova.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bossanova]] (1990)]]
After ''Doolittle'', Francis began to limit Deal's contributions to the band and began to assert more control over the band's output; the first three records had been partly written by Deal, but when ''[[Bossanova]]'' was released in 1990, all the original songs were by him. Deal was not pleased, and unilaterally announced an apparent break-up of the band on-stage during the following tour. The Pixies were at the height of their popularity, however, and while headlining at the [[Reading Festival]] in 1990, they played a highly enthusiastic version of "[[Debaser]]" which has become legendary among fans.

Perhaps owing to Deal's lack of input, the subject matter changed from earlier albums, to a more [[sci-fi]], [[Surrealism|surreal]] focus on UFOs and [[Abduction phenomenon|alien abduction]]<ref name="ufo" />. The musical style of the album was inspired by [[surf-rock]], as ''Bossanova'' started with a cover of "Cecilia Ann" by The Surftones.

The style of music in ''[[Bossanova]]'' was a departure from previous albums. For example, songs such as "Havalina" and "Ana" showed a dreamy side to the band, and Francis' vocals were notably more tuneful (although on "Rock Music", he displayed his trademark screaming). "Dig For Fire" was, according to Francis,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://aleceiffel.free.fr/quotes.html | title=The Pixies: Quotes | accessdate=2006-08-27}}</ref> a [[Talking Heads]] tribute, and "All Over The World" was also written in a similar musical style. The lead guitar of Santiago was less prominent, with none of the wilder solos that were present in ''Come On Pilgrim'' or ''Surfer Rosa''. The track "[[Allison (song)|Allison]]" was a tribute to one of Francis' musical heroes [[Mose Allison]] (an American [[jazz]] and [[blues]] artist). The track references space and the universe &ndash; ideas commonly explored in Mose's work.

[[Image:Pixies-TrompeLeMondeCover.jpg|thumb|left|[[Trompe le Monde]] (1991)]]
The band continued to tour, and, break-up announcements notwithstanding, one more album was to follow. ''[[Trompe le Monde]]'', released in 1991, still featured little creative input from Deal and wasn't as immediately well regarded as their first few albums.  Before its release, it was rumored that the album drew inspiration from [[heavy metal]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://aleceiffel.free.fr/rev_tlm.html | title=''Trompe Le Monde'' reviews | accessdate = 2006-08-20}}</ref> and the band's pre-album release of "[[Planet of Sound]]", a heavier song than their usual output, did not quell the rumors. 

In the end, ''Trompe Le Monde'' expanded on the UFO and sci-fi themes (including a song on [[space travel]], "[[Planet of Sound]] and "Motorway to Roswell" about an alien vacation gone bad).<ref>Francis, Black. Lyrics. "[http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=43099 Planet of Sound]." ''[[Trompe Le Monde]]''). [[Gramophone record|LP]]. [[4AD Records|4AD]] 1991.</ref> Songs such as "Bird Dream of the Olympus Mons" and "Lovely Day" were written in a similar style to songs on ''Bossanova'' (such as "Havalina"). The album saw the band move in a more popular direction with songs as "Palace of the Brine" (the first time Deal is heard singing backing vocals in the album) and "Trompe Le Monde", and the song "U-Mass" ({{audio-nohelp|PixiesUMass.ogg|sample}}) included the keyboardist [[Eric Drew Feldman]] <U+2014> a move unthinkable in the band's ''Come On Pilgrim'' and ''Surfer Rosa'' days. The album also featured a cover of "Head On" by [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]]. ''Trompe Le Monde'' was to be the Pixies last studio album before their breakup.

Following the release of ''Trompe Le Monde'', the band contributed a cover of "I Can't Forget" to the [[Leonard Cohen]] [[tribute album]] ''[[I'm Your Fan]]'' and went on a sellout winter tour of the USA, culminating on a TV appearance on [[The Tonight Show]]. They then embarked on an uncomfortable tour supporting fans [[U2]] (on their [[Zoo TV]] tour) in 1992. However, tensions rose between band members, and, at the end of the year, the Pixies went on sabbatical and focused on separate projects.<ref>During this time, Deal returned to the Breeders, who released their EP ''Safari''.</ref> 

In early 1993, Francis announced in an interview to [[BBC Radio 5]] that the band was finished and offered no explanation at the time, unbeknownst to the other members of the band.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://aleceiffel.free.fr/split.html | title=PIXIES' BOSSA SAYS IT'S NOVA! | accessdate=2006-10-05 | author=NME | date=1993-01-23}}</ref> He later telephoned Santiago and subsequently notified Deal and Lovering via [[fax]], in January 1993.<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 7</ref> Black later regretted breaking up the band in that fashion, as he did not allow the rest of the band an opportunity to discuss the move.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nuvo.net/archive/2005/06/01/once_more_the_pixies.html | accessdate=2006-08-22 | title=Once more, the Pixies |author=Scully, Alan | date=2005-06-01}}</ref>

===After the breakup===
Black Francis renamed himself [[Frank Black]], and released three solo albums. He then went on to form a band with Scott Boutier, Eric Drew Feldman, Rich Gilbert, David McCaffrey, and Dave Phillips called [[Frank Black and the Catholics]], who released six albums with a more stripped down, country tinge than Black's solo work. In 2005, Black released his fourth solo album, ''[[Honeycomb (album)|Honeycomb]]'', featuring a mellow, [[rhythm and blues]]-styled approach and backing from seasoned [[Nashville]] musicians. He released a further [[double album]] from the same sessions, ''[[Fastman Raiderman]]'', on July 19, 2006.

Deal returned to the [[Breeders]] and scored a hit with "Cannonball" from that group's ''Last Splash'' in 1993. However, for several years they struggled to produce another album, mainly due to her sister and fellow band member, [[Kelley Deal|Kelley]]'s, struggles with [[heroin]]. The album, ''Title TK'', finally appeared in 2002, with only Kim and Kelley remaining from the previous Breeders lineup. While on hiatus from the Breeders, Deal formed and recorded with [[The Amps]], who released their only album ''[[Pacer (album)|Pacer]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nudeasthenews.com/reviews/460 | title=The Amps: Pacer | accessdate=2006-09-19}}</ref> 

Lovering went on to become a magician and make occasional appearances as "[[The Scientific Phenomenalist]]", performing experiments on stage and occasionally opening for Frank Black and the Breeders.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nipp.com/artists/detail/david-loveringscientific-phenomenalist | title=David Lovering<U+2014>Scientific Phenomenalist | accessdate=2006-09-13}}</ref> Lovering continued to drum, playing on one of [[Tanya Donelly]]'s solo albums. Santiago played lead guitar on one of Frank Black's solo albums, and on other albums such as ''Statecraft'', by eccentric indie-rock musician [[Charles Douglas]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.indieonline.com/artist9.html | title=Charles Douglas - STATECRAFT | accessdate=2006-09-13}}</ref> He wrote theme music for [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television, and formed a band called [[The Martinis]] with his wife, [[Linda Mallari]]. They released their debut album, ''Smitten'', in 2004.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.themartinis.com/ | title=The Martinis | accessdate=2006-09-13}}</ref>

After the band broke up, 4AD and Elektra Records released compilation albums such as ''[[Death to the Pixies]]'' and ''[[Complete B-Sides]]'', along with ''[[The Purple Tape|Pixies]] (The Purple Tape)'' and ''[[Pixies at the BBC]]''.

===Reunion===

In the 11 years following the break-up, rumours frequently circulated regarding a reunion. Though Frank Black steadfastly dismissed them, he did begin to incorporate an increasing number of Pixies songs in his sets with the Catholics, and occasionally included Santiago and Lovering in his solo work. In late 2003 a press release from Black's publicist officially confirmed that a reunion would occur in the spring of 2004.  The Pixies played their first reunion concert on [[April 13]] [[2004]] at The Fine Line Music Cafe in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/pixies/7399 | title=Pixies : Minneapolis Fine Line Music Cafe | accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref> and a warmup tour through the U.S. and Canada was followed by appearances at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]].  The band then spent much of 2004 touring throughout Europe, Japan, and the U.S.

In June of 2004, the band released a new single, "[[Bam Thwok]]" ({{audio|BamThwok.ogg|sample}}) exclusively on the [[iTunes Music Store]]. The song reached number one in the [[UK Official Download Chart|British download chart]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/28/download_chart_lives/ | title=Pixies top UK download chart | accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref>  4AD released ''[[Wave of Mutilation: The Best of the Pixies]]'', along with a companion DVD.  The band also contributed to the [[Warren Zevon]] tribute album ''[[Enjoy Every Sandwich: Songs of Warren Zevon|Enjoy Every Sandwich]]''. 

2005 saw the band make appearances at the [[Lollapalooza]] and [[Sasquatch! Music Festival|Sasquatch!]] music festivals.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pixies/articles/story/7276003/weezer_rock_lollapalooza | title=Weezer Rock Lollapalooza:Pixies | accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/music/article.asp?articleID=13921 | title=Sasquatch!

In August, the band performed an entirely acoustic set (after a warm-up acoustic set in [[Albany, New York]]) at the [[Newport Folk Festival]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000963003 | title=Pixies Unplug for Newport Folk Festival | accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gigwise.com/news.asp?contentid=6211 | title= Pixies Supported by Idlewild at 'T on the Fringe' | accessdate=2006-09-10}} Also has a complete list of the band's summer 2004 tour dates</ref>

===New album===
In July 2005, Black said that the band hopes to record a new album, their first since 1991. "We really want to make a record for the right reasons, whether it is successful commercially or not," Black said.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nme.com/news/113023.htm | title=Pixies to Make First Album in 14 Years | accessdate=2006-09-17}}</ref> Black reportedly presented a batch of songs to the group for consideration sometime in 2006, but later described them as "too fakey".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002690443 | title=Black Bags Penning Pixie-Esque Songs| date=2006-06-19 | author=Gary Graff, [[Billboard]] | accessdate=2006-10-09}}</ref> Though it was widely reported that any new album efforts had been abandoned,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nme.com/news/pixies/23519 | title=Pixies Will Never Record Again | accessdate=2006-09-17}}</ref> Black revealed at a Spanish press conference in July 2006 that the band tentatively planned to continue working on new material, with the caveat that "if it doesn't sound good, we don't put the machine into record",<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.frankblack.net/news/#364 | title=Pixies to Play with New Material | accessdate=2006-09-17}}</ref> and in October 2006, he announced that the band would start rehearsing and recording an album in January 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nme.com/news/pixies/24809 | title=Pixies to begin work on new album | accessdate=2006-10-25 | author=NME}}</ref>

==Musical style==
Although the Pixies' musical style has changed over time, the band is considered to be an alternative rock band alongside similar bands such as the [[Throwing Muses]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/pixies/bio.jhtml#/music/artist/pixies/bio.jhtml | title=The Pixies - Profile and Biography | accessdate=2006-09-30}}</ref> The Pixies explored a range of song styles in their songs &mdash; although many songs were characterized by Francis' distinctive yowling and lead vocals, with Deal's feathery backing vocals (on songs such as "I Bleed" and "Debaser") and Santiago's erratic lead guitar. The band's sound has progressed from an indie rock sound in ''Come on Pilgrim'' and  ''Surfer Rosa'', to a more sci-fi rock sound, in ''Bossanova'' and ''Trompe le Monde''. However, they have experimented with other genres of music, such as surf rock ("Cecilla Ann" in ''Bossanova''), rock ("U-Mass") and pseudo-metal ("Planet of Sound", both in ''Trompe le Monde'').   

===Influences===
The Pixies draw influence from a range of artists and genres; each member came from a different musical background. Francis listened to [[The Beatles]] and cited [[Iggy Pop]] as his main influence in an interview to ''Mojo Magazine''; and Santiago, as mentioned above, listened to 1970s and 1980s punk (including bands such as H<U+00FC>sker D<U+00FC>) and David Bowie.<ref name="officialprofile" /> Deal's musical background was [[country music|country]]; she had formed a country band with her sister in her teenage years. Folk music has influenced the Pixies; Francis often listened to Larry Norman, and the band famously requested a bassist that was "into Peter, Paul and Mary", a folk trio.

Other media such as film has had an impact on the Pixies; Francis cites surrealist films [[Eraserhead]] and [[Un Chien Andalou]] (as mentioned in "Debaser") as influences.<ref name="officialprofile" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://dag.wieers.com/debaser/lyrics/Debaser.php | title=Pixies - Debaser | accessdate=2006-10-01}}</ref> He commented on these influences (which he paid tribute to most in ''Doolittle''), saying he "didn't have the patience to sit around reading Surrealist novels", but found it easier to watch twenty-minute films.<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 29</ref> He claimed the band members were "surrealists" in an interview to ''Melody Maker'':<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 27</ref>

{{cquote|Maybe the [[avant-garde]] appeals to people from our economic background, because we're typically rejecting the older meaningful [[Christianity|Christian]] values, but we're still confused as hell.}}

===Songwriting and vocals===
Most of the Pixies songs were composed and sung by Francis, whose songwriting style was characterized by a focus on Biblical violence ("Dead", "Gouge Away"), and incest ("The Holiday Song"). He later commented on this in an interview to ''Melody Maker'':<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 18</ref>

{{cquote|It's all those characters in the [[Old Testament]]. I'm obsessed with them. Why it comes out so much I don't know.}}

However, he wrote about other offbeat subjects&mdash;such as the sea ("Where Is My Mind?" and "Wave of Mutilation") and nuclear bombs ("Here Comes Your Man"). In the band's early works (the ''Come On Pilgrim'' era), he included references to Christian themes ("Levitate Me"). Later, as the band's career progressed, he began to focus on sci-fi concepts and themes such as [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]]s ("Motorway to Roswell") and unidentified flying objects ("The Happening"). Francis continued to explore these themes in his later solo work.

Deal sang lead vocals on "Gigantic" and the band's latest composition, "[[Bam Thwok]]," both of which she wrote, as well as on "Silver," co-written with Francis; she also sang lead vocals on the Francis-written "Into the White" and the Neil Young cover "I've Been Waiting For You." Lovering sang lead vocals on "La La Love You" and "Make Believe"; both songs were written by Francis.

===Covers===
The band has recorded several covers: "[[Wild Honey Pie]]" ([[The Beatles]]), "Ain't That Pretty At All" ([[Warren Zevon]]), "Winterlong" and "I've Been Waiting For You" ([[Neil Young]]), "I Can't Forget" ([[Leonard Cohen]]), a Spanish version of "Evil Hearted You" ([[The Yardbirds]]), "Head On" ([[The Jesus and Mary Chain]]), "Cecilia Ann" ([[The Surftones]]), "Born in Chicago" ([[The Paul Butterfield Blues Band]]), and "In Heaven (The Lady in the Radiator Song)" (from the film ''[[Eraserhead]]'').

===Instrumentation===
In terms of instrumentation, the Pixies are a four-piece [[rock band]]. Francis, the group's frontman, is the rhythm guitarist and uses either a [[Fender Telecaster]], [[Fender Mustang]], or [[Fender Jaguar]], with either the [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall JCM 800]] or the [[Vox AC30]] as [[Instrument amplifier|amplification]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://guitargeek.com/rigview/328/ | title=guitargeek: Frank Black of the Pixies | accessdate=2006-09-10 | author=guitargeek}}</ref> Santiago, the lead guitarist, is a "strict [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul]] man" (he owns 3 Les Pauls), but also has a [[Gibson ES-335]] and uses a [[Pearce GR]]-8 amplifier. Deal, the bassist in the band, plays either a [[Fender Precision Bass|Fender Precision]] or [[Music Man Stingray]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bassplayer.com/story.asp?storyCode=4025 | title=Bass Player <U+2014> The Pixies' Kim Deal | accessdate=2006-09-01 | author=Bill Leigh, [[Bass Player]] | year=2004 | month=11}}</ref> bass and Lovering, the drummer, plays a five-piece white Pro Prestige custom drumkit.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://aleceiffel.free.fr/gear.html | title=Instruments Played by the Pixies | accessdate=2006-08-29 | author=Jean-Michel Biel, Christophe Gourraud}}</ref>

As their career has progressed, starting with "Monkey Gone to Heaven" (from ''Doolittle''), the band have incorporated other, often unusual instruments and experimented more with their sound. For example, "Monkey Gone to Heaven" used a string section. "Velouria" (from ''Bossanova'') had a [[theremin]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://discorder.citr.ca/features/04maytheremin.html | title=Theremin-mania! | accessdate=2006-09-12 | author=susykat | year=2004 | month=05}}</ref><ref>A theremin is an uncommon instrument in alternative rock</ref> "U-Mass" featured a keyboard part (played by Eric Drew Feldman) and "Bam Thwok", their latest release, has an organ solo halfway through the song.

==Legacy==
Although the Pixies produced relatively few albums, they had a great influence on the alternative rock boom of the 1990s that started with Nirvana's "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]". Gary Smith, who produced the Pixies' first recording, ''Come on Pilgrim'', commented on the band's influence on alternative rock and their legacy (in 1997):<ref name="officialprofile" />

{{cquote|I've heard it said about [[The Velvet Underground]] that while not a lot of people bought their albums, everyone who did started a band. I think this is largely true about the Pixies as well. Charles' secret weapon turned out to be not so secret and, sooner or later, all sorts of bands were exploiting the same strategy of wide dynamics. It became a kind of new pop formula and, within a short while, "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was charging up the charts and even the members of Nirvana said later that it sounded for all the world like a Pixies song.}}

Sonically, the Pixies are credited with popularizing the extreme dynamics and stop-start timing that would come to define alternative rock; Pixies songs typically feature hushed, restrained verses, and explosive, wailing choruses.<ref>For example, a Pixies documentary [[loudQUIETloud]], is named after their trademark dynamics.</ref> Cover songs and commentary from artists and groups such as [[David Bowie]],<ref>Bowie later covered the song [[Cactus (song)|Cactus]] from ''[[Surfer Rosa]]'' in his album, ''[[Heathen (album)|Heathen]]''</ref> [[Radiohead]], [[U2]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and critics such as [[Graham Linehan]]<ref name="theysaid" /> attest to the appreciation of the band by musicians and critics alike.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rhino.com/rzine/pressrelease.lasso?PRID=330 | title=PIXIES SELL OUT Live-In-Concert DVD | accessdate=2006-09-09}}</ref> [[Bob Mould]] (from [[H<U+00FC>sker D<U+00FC>]], who the Pixies cited as an influence) said he "was a huge Pixies fan" and [[Thom Yorke]] (of [[Radiohead]]), after being informed of the Pixies plans to play before them at the [[Coachella Festival]], exclaimed:

{{cquote|No! That's just not right! The Pixies opening for us is like the Beatles opening for us. I won't allow it. There's no way we can follow the Pixies!}}

Yorke said in the same Coachella Festival that, while at school, "the Pixies had changed my life". Other members of Radiohead have  cited Pixies as an influence, and Yorke commented, "If we were all into the Pixies and nothing else, then it would be pretty obvious what the band would sound like."

While touring with U2 in 1992, the Pixies were sent a note from the band saying "Keep digging for fire. We love you." David Bowie, who had inspired Francis and Santiago while they were at university, mourned the band's breakup: "I felt very depressed the day I heard about the Pixies split. What a waste...I could see them becoming huge." This statement echoed many artists at that time who felt the band should have had more commercial success.<ref name="theysaid" />

The most notable citation as an influence was by Kurt Cobain, on influencing Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit", which he admitted was a conscious attempt to co-opt the Pixies' style. In a January 1994 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', he revealed:<ref name="theysaid" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3729933.stm | title=BBC Entertainment <U+2014> The Pixies: Rock's comeback kings | accessdate=2006-08-11}}</ref>

{{cquote|I was trying to write the ultimate pop song. I was basically trying to rip off the Pixies. I have to admit it (smiles). When I heard the Pixies for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily I should have been in that band - or at least in a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard.}}

[[Weezer]] (who later covered "Velouria" in the Pixies tribute album, ''[[Where Is My Mind? Tribute to the Pixies|Where Is My Mind?]]'') have cited the Pixies as an influence on their music and [[Rivers Cuomo]] (the lead singer), in an ''Addicted To Noise'' interview, said that the band "really blew my mind when I first moved to L.A. and started to discover cool music." [[Damon Albarn]] (of the band [[Blur (band)|Blur]]) said: "When we started we wanted to sound like the Pixies."<ref name="theysaid" /> The number of [[Pixies discography#Tributes to the Pixies|tribute albums]] recorded gives backing to their position as a major influence in modern alternative rock music.

===In popular culture===
The Pixies' music, despite never reaching great [[mainstream]] popularity, is frequently found in [[popular culture]]. Many TV shows, movies, and [[Computer and video games|video games]] have made use of Pixies songs. The most prominent appearance of a Pixies song was the use of "Where Is My Mind?" as the exit music to the popular film ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]''. 

"I've Been Tired" can be heard in the background in the movie ''[[Unbreakable]]''. The movie ''[[The United States of Leland]]'' features both "Gigantic" and "Hang Wire" as background music. "Where Is My Mind?" has been used in the movie ''[[The Weather Man]]'', in an episode of ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', and the [[Mars Exploration Rover]] ''[[Spirit rover|Spirit]]'' "woke up" to the song after a memory reformat and software upgrade.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mer/daily.cfm?date=4&year=2004 | title=Refreshed and Ready to Rock and Rove | accessdate=2006-09-17}}</ref>

"Debaser" is featured in the soundtrack for video game ''[[NCAA Football 06]]'' (though all references to "slicing up eyeballs" have been edited out), the song is also played during the opening credits of the movie ''[[Haiku Tunnel]]'' and in an episode of ''[[The O.C.]]''. "Tame" was used in a TV advertisement by [[Smirnoff]]. "Wave Of Mutilation (UK Surf)" is included on the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Pump Up the Volume (film)|Pump Up The Volume]]''. Both "La La Love You" and "Here Comes Your Man" are played in the movie ''[[Stuck on You (2003 film)|Stuck on You]]''. "Here Comes Your Man" appears in the films ''[[My Girl (film)|My Girl]]'', and ''[[Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo ]]''. "Monkey Gone to Heaven" has been used in the movie ''[[Grosse Pointe Blank]]'', and in a ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'' episode. Pixies' cover of [[List of surf rock musicians|The Surftones]]' "Cecilia Ann" is played over the opening sequence of [[Noah Baumbach]]'s 1995 film ''[[Kicking and Screaming]]''. "Rock Music" ends the premiere episode of the television series ''[[Criminal Minds]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://aleceiffel.free.fr/misc_refs.html | title=References to the Pixies | accessdate=2006-09-11}}</ref>  "U-Mass" is used in the 2006 film ''[[Accepted]]''.

==Television appearances and videos==
[[Image:PixiesVelouriaVideo.png|thumb|250px|right|A screenshot of the "Velouria" video, with the four band members running down the quarry]]
The Pixies appeared on several television shows during their original incarnation, including ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and ''[[120 Minutes]]'' in the US, and ''[[The Word (TV series)|The Word]]'' in the UK.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://aleceiffel.free.fr/videos.html#tv | title=Pixies TV appearances | accessdate=2006-10-01 | author=Jean-Michel Biel, Christophe Gourraud}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.broszkowski.com/tv/pixies/pixiesvideodownload.html | title=pixies video downloads | accessdate=2006-10-01 | author=Matthew Broszkowski}}</ref>

Since the band were signed to the small alternative record label, 4AD, at the time of ''Come On Pilgrim'' and ''Surfer Rosa'', no [[music video|videos]] were released from their first two records. Starting with ''Doolittle'', their first release with Elektra Records, the band released music videos with their singles, but the videos were often simple affairs. For example, in songs such as "Monkey Gone To Heaven", "Head On" and "Debaser", the videos often consisted of the band playing their instruments. 

By ''Bossanova'', the band had a developed a severe aversion to recording music videos, as Francis refused to [[lip-sync]] to them.<ref name="pg140">Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 140</ref> According to the record label this became one of the reasons that the Pixies never achieved major coverage on [[MTV]].<ref name="pg140" />

==="Velouria" video===
As "[[Velouria]]" (their first single from ''Bossanova'') was climbing up the [[UK Top 40]], the band was offered a spot on ''[[Top Of The Pops]]''. However, a [[BBC]] rule stated that only singles with videos could be performed on the show. To counter this a cheap video was made, with the band being filmed running down a quarry.<ref name="pg140" />

In the video, ten seconds of footage (the time needed for the band members to reach the camera) is slowed in order to last for the duration of the song.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://aleceiffel.free.fr/videos.html | title=The Pixies In Video | accessdate=2006-10-01 | author=Jean-Michel Biel, Christophe Gourraud}}</ref>  However, the effort in filming the video was in vain; the Pixies did not play "Velouria" on ''Top of The Pops'' while the single was in the charts.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.playlouder.com/feature/+pixies4/ | title=The Pixies And Me | accessdate=2006-10-17 | author=Andy Barding | date=2004-06-07}}</ref> In fact, the band never appeared on the show.

==Awards and achievements==
Although the band never gained mainstream recognition in its original incarnation, the band won several awards from music publications and local music awards. For example, they won the '''Act of the Year''' award in the 2004 ''Boston Music Awards''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2004/09/30/music_awards_celebrate_songs_not_celebrities/ | title=Music Awards celebrate songs, not celebrities | accessdate=2006-10-01 | author=Ken Capobianco - The Boston Globe}}</ref> The Pixies also won acclaim from alternative music publications for their records:
