==History==

[[Image:Shamsol-emereh-golestan-pal.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Shams ol-Em<U+0101>reh'' was Tehran's first tallest building, built between 1865 and 1867.]]

[[Image:Tehran Urbanization.gif|thumb|left|200px|Tehran in 1985 and 2009.]]

The origin of the name Tehran is unknown.<ref>Behrooz, Samira; Karampour, Katayoun. [http://universityandheritage.net/SIFU/XII_Hanoi_2009/en/abstracts/html/14.html ''A Research on Adaptation of Historic Urban Landscapes ; The Case of The Historical City of Tehran.''] Tehran Historical City Office.</ref> Tehran was well known as a village in the 9th century, but was less well-known than the city of [[Ray, Iran|Rhages]] (Ray) which was flourishing nearby in the early era. In the 13th century, following the destruction of Ray by [[Mongols]], many of its inhabitants escaped to Tehran. In some sources of the early era, the city is mentioned as "Rhages's Tehran" . The city is later mentioned in [[Hamdollah Mostowfi]]'s ''Nuz'hat al-Qulub'' (written in 1340) as a famous village.

Don [[Ruy Gonz<U+00E1>les de Clavijo]], a [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] ambassador, was probably the first European to visit Tehran, stopping in July 1404, while on a journey to [[Samarkand]] (now in [[Uzbekistan]]) the capital of [[Timur]], who ruled Iran at the time. At this time, the city of Tehran was unwalled.

Tehran became a residence of the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] rulers in the 17th century. [[Tahmasp I]] built a [[bazaar]] and a wall around the city, but it somewhat fell out of favor after [[Abbas I of Safavid|Abbas I]] turned sick when he was passing the city to go to a war with the [[Uzbeks]].

In the early of 18th century, [[Karim Khan|Karim Khan Zand]] ordered a [[palace]], and a government office to be built in Tehran, possibly to declare the city his capital, but later moved his government to [[Shiraz]]. Tehran finally became the capital of [[Persian Empire|Iran]] in 1795, when the [[Qajar]] king [[Agha Mohammad Khan]] was crowned in the city. It remains the capital to this day.

In the 1920s and 30's, the city essentially was started from scratch under the rule of the [[Shah of Iran]], [[Reza Shah]] Pahlavi. Reza Shah believed that ancient buildings such as large parts of the [[Golestan Palace]], Takieh-ye Dowlat, the [[Toopkhaneh|Toopkhaneh Square]], the city fortifications and the old citadel among others should not be part of a modern city. They were systematically destroyed and modern buildings with pre-islamic Iranian style, such as the National Bank, Police Headquarter, Telegraph Office and Military Academy were built in their place. The [[Tehran Bazaar]] was divided in half and many historic buildings were destroyed in order to build wide straight avenues in the capital. Many examples of Persian Gardens also became targets to new construction projects.

During [[World War II]], [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops entered the city. Tehran was the site of the [[Tehran Conference]] in 1943, attended by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]], and [[Soviet Premier]] [[Joseph Stalin]].

In the 1960s and 70's Tehran was rapidly developing under the reign of Shah [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi]]. Modern Buildings altered the face of Tehran and ambitious projects were envisioned for the following decades. The majority of these projects were stopped by the Islamic Revolution 1979, with few elements of them, such as the [[Milad Tower]], being built under the new regime decades later.

During the 1980<U+2013>88 [[Iran<U+2013>Iraq War]], Tehran was the scene of repeated [[Scud]] missile attacks and air strikes

==Climate==
[[Image:Damavand from dizin.jpg|thumb|left|200px|View of [[Mount Damavand]] as seen from the [[Dizin|Dizin ski resort]].]]

Tehran features a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]], [[Continentality|continental]] climate ([[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]] ''[[Cold steppe|BSk]]''). Tehran's climate is largely defined by its geographic location, with the towering [[Alborz|Alborz Mountains]] to its north and the central desert to the south. It can be generally described as mild in the spring, hot and dry in the summer, pleasant in the autumn, and cold in the winter. As a large city with a significant differences in elevation among various districts, the [[weather]] is often cooler in the hilly north as compared to the flat southern part of Tehran.
Summer is usually hot and dry with very little rain, but [[relative humidity]] is generally low and the nights are cool. The majority of the light annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] occurs from late-autumn to mid-spring, but no one month is particularly wet. The hottest month is July (mean minimum temperature 26<U+00B0>C, mean maximum temperature 36<U+00B0>C) and the coldest is January (mean minimum temperature -1<U+00B0>C, mean maximum temperature 8<U+00B0>C).<ref name="IranTour">{{cite web|url=http://www.irantour.org/Iran/Climate.html |title=Climate of Tehran |publisher=Irantour.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref><br />
Although compared with other parts of the country Tehran enjoys a more moderate climate, weather conditions can sometimes be unpredictably harsh. The record high temperature is 43<U+00B0>C and the record low is -15<U+00B0>C. On January 5 & 6, 2008, after years of relatively little snow, a [[Winter storm|wave of heavy snow and low temperatures]] shocked the city covering it in a thick layer of snow and ice, forcing the Council of Ministers to officially declare an [[state of emergency]] and calling the following two days (January 6 and 7) off for the capital.<ref name="IRNA">[http://www1.irna.com/fa/news/view/line-2/8610166477213215.htm/ Heavy Snowfall in Tehran (in Persian)]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref>

==Demographics==
{{See also|Demographics of Iran}}
[[Image:Tehran Population (1956-2006).png|thumb|200px|right|Population of Tehran]]

The city of Tehran had a population of approximately 7,8 million in 2006.<ref>[http://www.sci.org.ir/content/userfiles/_census85/census85/natayej/ ]{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref>  With its cosmopolitan air, Tehran houses diverse ethnic and linguistics groups from all over the country and represents the ethnic/linguistic composition of Iran (though with a different percentage).  Today the majority of Tehran residents are known as [[Persian people|Persians]] who speak various dialects of Persian corresponding to their places of origin. The native language of the city is the [[Tehrani accent|Tehrani dialect]] of Persian.
Minority groups include [[Iranian Azeri|Azeri]], [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], [[Baloch people|Baluch]], [[Armenians in Iran|Armenian]], [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]], [[Assyrians in Iran|Assyrian]], [[Talysh people|Talysh]], etc. A number of Arabic speakers of [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] and [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] origin also live in Tehran.  According to a 2010 census conducted in 374 districts of Tehran, 63% of people in Tehran were born in Tehran, 98% know Persian, 67% identify themselves as ethnic [[Persian peoples|Persian]], 13% understand to some level some European languages.<ref>"Chand Darsad Tehranihaa dar Tehran Bedonyaa Amadand"(How many percent of Tehranis were born in Tehran), accessed December, 2010 [http://www.tabnak.ir/fa/news/133668][http://news.veyq.ir/news/114265/%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%AD-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%B1%D8%B3%DB%8C-%D9%88%D9%85%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%87-%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1%D9%81-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%AE%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%87%D9%86%DA%AF%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF-67%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B5%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B3%DB%8C-%D8%B2%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%87%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%E2%80%8C-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87-%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86%DA%AF%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%AF4-5-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%BA%D8%AA-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AF][http://www.aftabnews.ir/vdchimnzw23nzid.tft2.html][http://www.asriran.com/fa/news/147352/%DA%86%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B5%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%AF%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%A7-%D8%A2%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%87%E2%80%8C%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%9F]</ref>

Tehran saw a drastic change in its ethno-social composition in early 1980s. Following the political, social and economic consequences of the [[Islamic Revolution of Iran]] in 1979 and onwards, many Iranian citizens, mostly Tehranis left Iran due to mounting political, social and most importantly religious pressure. Many Iranians fled to countries such as [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[France]], [[Sweden]] and other European countries. The highest Iranian emigration has been to the [[Iranian American|United States]], [[Iranians in France|France]] and [[Iranian Canadian|Canada]].

With the start of the [[Iran<U+2013>Iraq War]] (1980<U+2013>1988) following an Iraqi invasion, a second wave of inhabitants fled the city, especially during Iraqi air offensive on the capital. With most major powers backing Iraq at that time, economic isolation caused even more reasons for the inhabitants to leave the city (and the country). Having left all they had and having struggled to adapt to a new country and build a life, most of them never came back when the war was over. During the war, Tehran also received a great number of migrants from the west and the southwest of the country bordering Iraq.

The unstable situation and the war in neighboring [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] prompted a rush of refugees into the country who came in millions, with Tehran being a magnet for modest workers who helped the city to recover from war wounds, charging far less than local construction workers. Many of these refugees are being repatriated with the assistance of [[UNHCR]] but there are still sizable groups of Afghan and Iraqi refugees in Tehran who are reluctant to leave, being pessimistic about the situation in their respective country of origin. Afghan refugees are mostly Persian-speaking [[Hazara people|Hazara]] or [[T<U+0101>jik people|Tajiks]], speaking a dialect of Persian, and Iraqi refugees, who are mainly [[Shia Islam]] [[Mesopotamia]]n Arabic-speakers of Iranian origin.

Because of the [[theocracy|theocratic government]] of the country, The majority of Tehranis are believed to be the followers of [[Twelvers|Twelver Shia Islam]] which is also the state religion but it can not be confirmed independently for lack of independent statistics. Religious minorities include followers of various sects of [[Sunni Islam]], [[Sufism|Mystic Islam]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith]], [[Judaism]], and [[Christianity]] (including the adherents of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], Iranian Protestant churches, Kelisa-ye Khanegi-ye Iraniyan, [[Armenian Evangelical Church]], [[Jama'at-e Rabbani]] (Assemblies of God), [[Armenian Brotherhood Church]], [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and the [[Presbyterian Church]]) plus [[agnostics]] and [[atheists]].
Despite being the seat of a theological government and the fact that most important religious unions and academies of the country are based in Tehran, half of the city (northern area) remains the most liberal in the nation, a fact that attracts many youngsters from elsewhere to study in the capital.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Tehran has many modern and chic restaurants, serving both traditional Iranian and cosmopolitan cuisine. The most popular dish of the city is the [[chelow kabab]] (kabob/kebab is originally a Persian word meaning grill). However, Western-style [[fast food]] is becoming popular, especially with the younger generation. Pizza, sandwich and kebab shops make up the majority of other food outlets in the city.

==Economy==

[[Image:Teh Ir.jpg|thumb|right|[[Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran]], Tehran]]

Tehran is the economic centre of Iran.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/585619/Tehran/276311/Economy britannica.com], accessed: June 2009.</ref> About 30% of Iran<U+2019>s public-sector workforce and 45% of large industrial firms are located in Tehran and almost half of these workers work for the government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/081006_iran_nuclear.pdf |title=Slide 1 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}</ref> Most of the remainder of workers are factory workers, shopkeepers, laborers, and transport workers. Few foreign companies operate in Tehran because of the [[Islamic government]]'s relations to the west. But before the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution]] many foreign companies were active in this region. Today many modern industries of this city include the manufacturing of automobiles, electronics and electrical equipment, weaponry, textiles, sugar, cement, and chemical products. It is also a leading center for the sale of carpets and furniture. There is an oil refinery near [[Ray, Iran|Ray]], south of the city. Tehran has four airports, including [[Mehrabad International Airport]], [[Imam Khomeini International Airport]], [[Ghal'eh Morghi airfield]] and [[Doshan Tapeh airbase]].

Tehran relies heavily on private cars, buses, motorcycles, and taxis, and is one of the most car-dependent cities in the world. The [[Tehran Stock Exchange]], which is a full member of the [[World Federation of Exchanges|Federation Internationale des Bourses de Valeurs]] (FIBV) and a founding member of the [[Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges]], has been one of the world's best performing stock exchanges in recent years.<ref>[[BBC]]: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3129995.stm</ref>

==Transportation==

[[File:Tehran IKI Airport.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport|Imam Khomeini International Airport]] (IKA).]]

Tehran is served by two airports. [[Mehrabad Airport]], an old airport which doubles as a military base is used for domestic and pilgrimage flights. This airport is located in the Western part of the city. [[Imam Khomeini International Airport]], located 50 kilometers (31&nbsp;mi) south of the city, handles almost all international flights.

===Metro===
{{See also|Tehran Metro}}
[[Image:Tehran metroStation.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Tehran Metro]]]]

Tehran has one of the cleanest and most convenient metro systems, in terms of accessibility to different parts of the city, in the region.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The feasibility study and conceptual planning of the construction were started in 1970s. In 2001, the first two of the eight projected metro lines were opened. Tehran Metro has four operative lines and is 120&nbsp;km long with another two lines under construction. Tehran has the longest metro line in the Middle East and currently the fourth longest in Asia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Train===
{{See also|Iranian Railways}}
Tehran also has a central train station with connecting services round the clock to various cities in the country. Tehran-[[Europe]] train line is active.

===Bus===
Tehran's transport system includes conventional buses, [[trolleybus]]es and [[Bus Rapid Transit]] (BRT).  Buses have served the city since the 1920s. There are four bus terminals that also provide connections at low rates.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} The terminals are located on the ''South'', ''East'', ''West'', and ''Bei-haghi Park-Drive''.

The [[trolleybus]] system opened in 1992, using a fleet of 65 [[articulated bus|articulated]] trolleybuses built by [[<U+0160>koda Works|Skoda]].<ref name="Murray">Murray, Alan (2000). ''World Trolleybus Encyclopaedia'', pp. 57 and 99. Yateley, Hampshire, UK: Trolleybooks. ISBN 0-904235-18-1.</ref>  This was the first trolleybus system in Iran and remain's the country's only such system.<ref name="Murray"/> In 2005, trolleybuses were operating on five routes, all starting at Meydan-e-Emam-Hoseyn ([[Imam Hossein Square]])<ref name="tm265">''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 265 (January<U+2013>February 2006), pp. 16<U+2013>17. National Trolleybus Association (UK). {{issn|0266-7452}}.</ref> and [[Imam Hossein Metro Station|Imam Hossein station]] of the [[Tehran Metro]] Line 2.  Two routes running northeastwards operate almost entirely in a segregated [[Bus Rapid Transit|busway]] located in the middle of the wide [[carriageway]] (along [[Damavand Street|Damavand Khiyaban]]), stopping only at purpose-built stops located about every 500 metres, effectively making these routes trolleybus-[[Bus Rapid Transit|BRT]] (but they are not called such).  The other three trolleybus routes run south from Meydan-e-Emam-Hoseyn and operate in mixed-traffic.  Both route sections are served both by [[limited-stop]] services and local (making all stops) services.<ref name="tm265"/>

[[Tehran Bus Rapid Transit]] (BRT) was officially inaugurated on 14 January 2008 by Tehran's mayor Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf. BRT has three lines with 60 stations in different areas of the city.

===Highways and streets===
The metropolis of Tehran enjoys a huge network of highways (280&nbsp;km) and of interchanges, ramps, and loops (180&nbsp;km) ([http://www.360cities.net/image/iran-tehran-highway-modarres-hemmat-junction#0.00,0.00,70.0|a panoramic view here]). In 2007 there were 130 kilometers of highways and 120 kilometers of ramps and loops under construction.<ref>[http://lycos.cs.cmu.edu/info/tehran.html Tehran]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}. ''An Educational Website about Tehran''</ref>

While the center of the city houses the government ministries and headquarters, the commercial centers are more located toward [[Valiasr Street|Valiasr Avenue]] (formerly known as Pahlavi Avenue), [[Taleghani Ave|Takht-e Jamshid Ave.]], and [[Beheshti Ave|Abbasabad Ave.]] further north. Although administratively separate, [[Ray, Iran|Rey]], [[Shemiran]], and [[Karaj]] are often considered part of the larger Tehran metropolitan area.

Also this is a list of Tehran streets named after international personalities:
* [[Henri Corbin]] Street - downtown Tehran
* [[Edward Granville Browne|Edward Browne]] Street - near the [[Tehran University|University of Tehran]]
* [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]] Street - northern Tehran
* [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] Expressway - western Tehran
* [[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal Lahori]] Street - eastern Tehran
* [[Patrice Lumumba]] Street - western Tehran
* [[Bobby Sands]] Street - western side of British Embassy
* [[Sim<U+00F3>n Bol<U+00ED>var]] Street - north western Tehran

==Pollution==
{{See also|Environmental issues in Iran|Automotive industry in Iran}}
[[Image:Northern-Tehran.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Tehran and the [[Alborz]] Mountains seen on a day of relatively clean air.]]

Tehran suffers from severe [[air pollution]] and the city is often covered by [[smog]] making breathing difficult and causing widespread pulmonary illnesses. It is estimated that about 27 people die each day from pollution-related diseases.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/story/2006/09/060909_mv-pollution-tehran.shtml <U+0647><U+0631> <U+0631><U+0648><U+0632> 27 <U+062A><U+0647><U+0631><U+0627><U+0646><U+06CC> <U+0628><U+0647> <U+062F><U+0644><U+064A><U+0644> <U+0622><U+0644><U+0648><U+062F><U+06AF><U+06CC> <U+0647><U+0648><U+0627> <U+0645><U+06CC> <U+0645><U+064A><U+0631><U+0646><U+062F>]. September 18, 2006</ref> According to local officials, 3,600 people died in a single month due to the hazardous air quality.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6245463.stm Iran smog 'kills 3,600 in month']. [[BBC News Online]]. January 9, 2007</ref> 80% of the city's pollution is due to cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/09/jan/1007.html |title=Car exhaust fumes blamed for over 80% of air pollution in Tehran |publisher=Payvand.com |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2010-09-25}}</ref> The remaining 20% is due to [[industrial pollution]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In 2007 Iran [[2007 Gas Rationing Plan in Iran|imposed fuel rations]] but the plan has met little success in reducing the pollution levels. Other estimates suggest that motorcycles alone account for 30% of air and 50% of [[sound pollution]] in Tehran.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/10/oct/1239.html |title=Motorcycles Account for 30% of Air Pollution in Tehran |publisher=Payvand.com |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref>

[[Image:TehranIranSkyline.jpg|thumb|left|Skyline of Tehran at night]]
The air pollution is due to several different reasons.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} 1) Economical: most Iranian industries are located on the outskirts of Tehran. The city is also overrun with old and aging cars which do not meet today's emission regulations. Furthermore, Iran's busiest airport, [[Mehrabad International Airport]], is located in the west of the city; 2) Most people are then obliged to either use private cars or hire taxis. This has created severe [[traffic congestion]]; 3) Geographical: Tehran is bound in the north by the massive [[Alborz]] mountain range that is stopping the flow of the humid Caspian wind. As a result, [[thermal inversion]] that traps Tehran's polluted air is frequently observed. The lack of humidity and clouds makes Tehran a very sunny city. The UV radiations then combined with the existing pollutants significantly raise the level of the [[ozone]].  Furthermore, the reportedly poor quality of Iranian-manufactured gasoline may also be contributing to the pollution.<ref>''[[The Economist]]'', "The smoggiest of all capitals", 1 January 2011, p. 40.</ref>

The government, however, is engaged in a battle to reduce the air pollution.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} It has for instance encouraged taxis and buses to convert from petrol engines to engines that run on [[compressed natural gas]]. Furthermore, since 1979 the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has set up a "Traffic Zone" (<U+0637><U+0631><U+062D> <U+062A><U+0631><U+0627><U+0641><U+06CC><U+06A9>) covering the city center during peak traffic hours. Entering and driving inside this zone is only allowed with a special permit. The government is also trying to raise people's awareness about the hazards of the pollution. One method that is currently being employed is the installation of Pollution Indicator Boards all around the city to monitor the current level of [[particulate matter]] (PM10), [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>), and [[carbon monoxide]] (CO). The board also displays the [[Pollutant Standards Index]] (PSI), which is a general indication of air quality based on the measurements of the above-mentioned five pollutants. The Pollution Indicator Boards classify the level of each pollutants as either safe, hazardous or dangerous.

Tehran is the biggest and most important educational center of Iran. Today there are nearly 50 major colleges and universities total in [[Greater Tehran]].

Since the establishment of [[Darolfonoon]] in the mid-19th century, Tehran has amassed a large number of institutions of higher education. Some of these institutions have played crucial roles in the unfolding of Iranian political events. [[Samuel M. Jordan]], whom Jordan Avenue in Tehran is named after, was also one of the founding pioneers of the [[Alborz High School|American College of Tehran]].
Among major educational institutions located in Tehran, [[Sharif University of Technology]], is the most prestigious technological university of Iran and [[Tehran University|University of Tehran]] is the largest and oldest state university in Iran and one of the oldest in Central Asia and Middle East.

[[Amirkabir University of Technology]] ([[Tehran Polytechnic]]) ,[[Shahid Beheshti University]] ([[Melli University]]), [[K.N.Toosi University of Technology]], [[Iran University of Science and Technology]], [[Iran University of Medical Sciences]], [[Shahed University]] and [[Tarbiat Modarres University]] are other highly ranked universities of Iran located in Tehran.

Tehran is also  home to Iran's largest military academy, and several religious schools and seminaries.

Tehran was the first city in the Middle East to host the [[Asian Games]]. The [[1974 Asian Games|7th Asian Summer Games in 1974]], was held with the participation of 2,363 athletes and officials from 25 countries.

[[Image:Tochal-telecabin.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Tochal Complex|Tochal Telecabin]], [[Tochal]]]]
[[Image:Azadistadium tehran iran.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|[[Azadi Stadium]] is [[List of association football stadia by capacity|the 4th]] biggest football stadium in the world and [[List of stadiums by capacity|the 1st]] in the Middle East.]]

Tehran is also the site of Iran's national football stadium on [[Azadi sports complex|Azadi Sport Complex]] with 100,000 [[seating capacity]]. Azadi Football Stadium is biggest stadium in [[Iran]] and [[Middle East]] and one of the biggest in the World. Many of the top matches of Iran's Premier League are held here. In 2005, [[FIFA]] ordered Iran to limit spectators allowed into Azadi stadium because of a fatal crush and inadequate safety procedures. Other stadiums in Tehran are [[Shahid Dastgerdi Stadium]], [[Takhti Stadium (Tehran)|Takhti Stadium]], and Shahid Shirudi Stadium, among others.

The ski resort of [[Dizin]] is situated to the north of Tehran in the [[Alborz Mountains]]. [[Tochal Complex|Tochal Ski Resort]] is the world's fifth highest ski resort, at over 3,730 metres (12,240&nbsp;ft) at its highest ''7th station''. The resort was completed in 1976 shortly before the overthrowing of the Shah.

Here, one must first ride the eight kilometre (five mile) long gondola lift which covers a huge vertical and is probably the longest line in the world.<ref>http://www.tochal.org/en/telecabin_introduction.asp</ref> The 7th station has three slopes. The resort's longest slope is the south side U shaped slope which goes from the 7th station to 5th station. The other two slopes are located on the north side of the 7th station. Here, there are two parallel chair ski lifts that go up to 3,900 metres (12,795&nbsp;ft) near Tochal's peak (at 4,000&nbsp;m/13,125&nbsp;ft), rising higher than the gondola 7th station. This altitude is higher than any of the European resorts.

From the Tochal peak, one has a spectacular view of the Alborz range, including the 5,671 metre (18,606&nbsp;ft) high [[Mount Damavand]], a dormant volcano.

At the bottom of the lifts in a valley behind the Tochal peak is [[Tochal Complex|Tochal Hotel]], located at 3,500&nbsp;metres (11,483&nbsp;ft) altitude. From there a T lift takes skiers up the 3,800 metres (12,500&nbsp;ft) of Shahneshin peak, where the third slope of Tochal is.

Tochal 7th station has skiing eight months of the year. But there are also some glaciers and year-round snow fields near Tehran where skiing began in 1938, thanks to the efforts of two German railway engineers. Today, 12 [[List of ski areas and resorts in Iran|ski resorts operate in Iran]], but the most famous are [[Tochal]], [[Dizin]], and [[Shemshak]], all within one to three hours of Tehran.

Tehran is a relatively old city; as such, it has an architectural tradition unique to itself. Archaeological investigations and excavations in Tehran demonstrate that this area was home to civilizations as far back as 6,000 years BC.  Tehran served only as a village to a relatively small population for most of its history, but began to take a more considerable role in Iran after it was made the capital in the late 18th century.  Despite the occurrence of earthquakes during the [[Qajar Dynasty|Qajar]] period and before, some buildings still remain from Tehran's era of antiquity.<ref>[http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/articles/article/Iran/Tehran-Capital-City-of-Iran/128 Tehran Capital City of Iran]. ''Tehran''</ref>  Today Tehran is Iran's [[primate city]], and has the most modernized infastructure in the country; however, the [[gentrification]] of old neighborhoods and the demolition of buildings of cultural significance has caused concerns.<ref>[http://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0408/iran.html The Style of Tehran]. Library of Congress. Retrieved 04-13-2008.</ref>

The [[Azadi Tower]] has been the longstanding symbol of Tehran. It was constructured to commemorate the [[2,500 year celebration of Iran's monarchy|2,500th anniversary of the Persian empire]], and was originally named "Shahyad Tower"; after the [[Iranian revolution]], its name changed to "Azadi Tower," meaning "Freedom Tower." The recently constructed [[Milad Tower]] may eventually replace the Azadi Tower as Tehran's new symbol. The Milad complex contains the world's [[list of towers|fourth tallest tower]], several restaurants, a five star hotel, a convention center, a world trade center, and an IT park.<ref>[http://www.miladtowertehran.com/lang/index.php Milad Tower Official Website]. ''Milad Tower''</ref> Traditionally a low-rise city due to seismic activity in the region, modern high rise developments in Tehran have been undertaken in order to service its growing population. There have been no major quakes in Tehran since 1830.<ref>{{cite news| publisher=The Guardian | title= Women to blame for earthquakes, says Iran cleric | date=2010-04-19 | url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/19/women-blame-earthquakes-iran-cleric }}</ref>

The tallest residential building in Iran is a 54-story building located North of [[Youssef Abad]] district, the [[Tehran International Tower]]. It is architecturally designed similar to [[Mandalay Bay]] Resort and Casino on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] in the [[Paradise, Nevada|Paradise]] community of [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]], [[Nevada]], [[United States]].<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.internationaltower.ir/ Tehran International Tower Website]. ''Tehran International Tower Website''</ref> Appealing to the principle of vertical rather than horizontal expansion of the city, the Tehran International Tower is bound to the North by Youssef Abad, to the South By Hakim Highway, to the East by Kordesstan Highway and to the West by Sheikh Bahai Highway, all of which facilitate access to various parts of the city.<ref name="autogenerated1" />
Tehran has a beautiful skyline with many midrise buildings and towers.
