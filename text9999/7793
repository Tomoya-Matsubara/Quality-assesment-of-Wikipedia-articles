'''''Calabria''''' was a small [[protected cruiser]] built for the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Royal Navy) in the 1890s, intended for service in Italy's [[Italian Empire|overseas empire]]. She was laid down in 1892, launched in 1894, and completed in 1897, and was armed with a main battery of four {{convert|15|cm|adj=on|sp=us}} and four {{convert|12|cm|abbr=on}} guns. ''Calabria'' spent significant periods abroad, ranging from deployments to Chinese, North American, and Australian waters, in addition to periods in Italy's East African empire. She saw action during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] in 1912 in the [[Red Sea]], primarily bombarding Turkish ports in the area. ''Calabria'' was reclassified as a [[gunboat]] in 1921, reduced to a training ship in 1924, and sold for scrap at the end of the year.

==Design==
''Calabria'' was designed by the Chief Engineer, [[Edoardo Masdea]], and was intended for overseas service. She had a steel hull sheathed with wood and [[zinc]] to protect it from [[fouling]] during lengthy deployments abroad. The hull was {{convert|76|m|sp=us}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and {{convert|81|m|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]]. It had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|12.71|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.05|m|abbr=on}}. Her normal displacement was {{convert|2453|MT|sp=us}} but increased to {{convert|2660|MT|abbr=on}} at full load. ''Calabria'' had a crew of between 214 and 254&nbsp;officers and enlisted crew.<ref name=G350>Gardiner, p. 350</ref><ref name=Italy>"Italy", p. 46</ref>

The cruiser was powered by two-shaft vertical [[triple-expansion engine]]s with steam supplied by four coal-fired, cylindrical [[water-tube boiler]]s that were trunked into a single funnel [[amidships]]. The engines had an output of {{convert|4260|ihp|lk=in}} and produced a top speed of {{convert|16.4|kn|lk=in}}. ''Calabria'' had a cruising radius of about {{convert|2500|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref name=G350/><ref name=Italy/>

''Calabria'' was armed with a main battery of four {{convert|15|cm|adj=on|sp=us}} L/40 guns and four {{convert|12|cm|abbr=on}} L/40 guns, all mounted individually.<ref group=Note>L/40 refers to the length of the gun in terms of [[Caliber (artillery)|caliber]].</ref> Light armaments included eight {{convert|5.7|cm|abbr=on}} L/40 guns, eight {{convert|3.7|cm|abbr=on}} L/20 guns, and a pair of machine guns. She was also equipped with a pair of {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s. Armor protection consisted of a {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} thick deck; her [[conning tower]] also received 50&nbsp;mm of steel plating.<ref name=G350/>

==Service history==
''Calabria'' was built at the [[La Spezia]] dockyard, with her [[keel]] being laid down in February 1892. She was launched on 20 September 1894, and [[fitting-out]] work was completed by mid-1897; the new cruiser was commissioned into the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Royal Navy) on 12 July.<ref name=G350/> ''Calabria'' spent long periods abroad in her first decade of service. She was operating in Chinese waters in 1899 when the [[Boxer Rebellion]] broke out. She joined an international fleet that included representatives from the fleets of the [[Eight Nation Alliance]] in the mouth of the [[Hai River]] while a contingent of 475 soldiers traveled to [[Beijing]] to reinforce the [[Beijing Legation Quarter|Legation Quarter]].<ref>''Journal of the RUSI'', p. 624</ref>

The ship was present on 20 May 1902 when the United States formally granted independence to the Republic of Cuba, following the [[Spanish-American War]] three years earlier. ''Calabria'' and the British cruiser {{HMS|Psyche|1898|6}} fired salutes to the United States cruiser {{USS|Brooklyn|CA-3|6}}.<ref>''Annual Report'', p. 4</ref> In March 1905 ''Calabria'' went on another cruise to American waters, this time to [[Santo Domingo]] in the Dominican Republic. The visit represented an attempt at [[gunboat diplomacy]], aimed at securing payments for debts to Italian nationals.<ref>''Foreign Relations'', p. 355</ref> Later in the year, ''Calabria'' visited Australia on a trip to [[show the flag]].<ref>Cresciani, p. 52</ref> In October 1909, ''Calabria'' took part in the Portola Festival in [[San Francisco]], marking the 140th anniversary of the [[Portol<U+00E0> expedition]], the first recorded European exploration of what became [[California]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Italy's Cruiser Calabria here for Festival|journal=[[San Francisco Call]]|date=14 October 1909|page=3|url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=SFC19091014.2.24&srpos=&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN-------#|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>

===Italo-Turkish War===
[[File:Red Sea topographic map-en.svg|thumb|upright|Map of the Red Sea, where ''Calabria'' operated during the war]]

At the outbreak of the [[Italo-Turkish War]] in September 1911, ''Calabria'' was stationed in the Far East,<ref>Beehler, p. 11</ref> but she was immediately recalled to reinforce the Italian colony of [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]]. After arriving in East African waters, she joined the cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Puglia||2}} in bombarding the Turkish port of [[Aqaba]] on 19 November to disperse a contingent of Ottoman soldiers there. Hostilities were temporarily ceased while the British King [[George V]] passed through the [[Red Sea]] following his coronation ceremony in [[India]]&mdash;the ceasefire lasted until 26 November. Four days later, ''Calabria'' and the [[gunboat]] {{ship|Italian gunboat|Volturno||2}} attacked a quarantine station near [[Perim]].<ref>Beehler, p. 48</ref> 

In early 1912, the Italian Red Sea Fleet searched for a group of seven Ottoman gunboats thought to be planning an attack on Eritrea, though they were in fact immobilized due to a lack of coal. ''Calabria'' and the ''Puglia'' carried out diversionary bombardments against [[Jebl Tahr]], and [[Al Lu<U+1E29>ayyah]], while the cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Piemonte||2}} and the destroyers {{ship|Italian destroyer|Artigliere|1907|2}} and {{ship|Italian destroyer|Garibaldino|1910|2}} searched for the gunboats. On 7 January, they found the gunboats and quickly sank four in the [[Battle of Kunfuda Bay]]; the other three were forced to beach to avoid sinking as well.<ref name=brassey12 p166-7">Hythe 1912, pp. 166<U+2013>167.</ref><ref name=B51>Beehler, p. 51</ref> The next day, the Italian warships sent a shore party to destroy the grounded gunboats.<ref>Willmott, p. 166</ref> ''Calabria'' and the rest of the Italian ships returned to bombarding the Turkish ports in the Red Sea before declaring a [[blockade]] of the city of [[Al Hudaydah]] on 26 January.<ref name=B51/> ''Calabria'' returned to Italy by April for refitting.<ref>Beehler, p. 70</ref>

===Later career===
In 1914, her armament was reduced; the 15&nbsp;cm guns were removed and two additional 12&nbsp;cm guns were installed in their place. Two of the 5.7&nbsp;cm guns and six of the 3.7&nbsp;cm guns were also removed.<ref name=G350/> The ship took a diplomatic mission from [[Massawa]] across the Red Sea to visit [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Hussein bin Ali]], the recently-proclaimed [[King of Hejaz]], in [[Mecca]] in July 1917.<ref>Peters, p. 328</ref> ''Calabria'' returned to East African waters in January 1918 on another mission to show the flag, particularly off the coast of Somalia. Stops included [[Aden]] and [[Djibouti]].<ref>Koburger, p. 14</ref> ''Calabria'' was reclassified as a gunboat in 1921, and she saw her armament modified again; a 15&nbsp;cm gun was reinstalled, as were two of the 5.7&nbsp;cm guns. A {{convert|4|cm|abbr=on}} L/39 [[autocannon]] was also added at this time. She served in this role for only a short time, and was reduced to a [[training ship]] for naval gunners in early 1924.<ref>Gardiner & Gray, p. 257</ref> This duty ended quickly, and she was sold for scrap on 13 November 1924.<ref name=G350/>
