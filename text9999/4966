The '''1821 Norfolk and Long Island Hurricane''' was one of two known [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricanes]] that have made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on what is now modern New York City. Another, even more intense hurricane struck the region in [[pre-Columbian]] times (somewhen between 1278 and 1438) and was detected by [[Paleotempestology|paleotempestological]] research.<ref name="sediment">{{cite journal |last=Donnelly |first=Jeffrey P. |authorlink= |coauthors=''et al.'' |year=2001 |month= |title=Sedimentary evidence of intense hurricane strikes from New Jersey |journal=Geology |volume=29 |issue=7 |pages=615<U+2013>618 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(2001)029<0615:SEOIHS>2.0.CO;2 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}</ref>

The first of three recorded [[tropical cyclone]]s recorded in the [[1820-1829 Atlantic hurricane seasons|1821 Atlantic hurricane season]], it was first observed off the southeast United States coast on September 1, with winds estimated in excess of 135&nbsp;mph (215&nbsp;km/h). It moved ashore near [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], and passed near [[Norfolk, Virginia]] before moving through the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] and [[New Jersey]] just inland. The hurricane struck New York City on September 3, approximately near [[Jamaica Bay]], and on September 4 it was observed over [[New England]]. The hurricane occurred just 6&nbsp;years after the destructive [[Great September Gale of 1815]].

==Meteorological history==
A [[tropical cyclone]] was first observed on September 1 off the southeast coast of the United States. Initially, it was believed to be the same storm that struck [[Guadeloupe]] on the same day, though subsequent research indicated there were two separate storms.<ref name="chenoweth">{{cite web|author=Chenoweth|year=2006|title=A Reassessment of Historical Atlantic Basin Tropical Cyclone Activity, 1700-1855|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2007-07-02|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/Chenoweth/chenoweth06.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> The hurricane tracked by the [[Bahamas]] while tracking generally northward, and it attained [[tropical cyclone scales|major hurricane]] status over the western Atlantic Ocean. As it approached the United States coastline, the hurricane was very intense, with winds estimated at over 135&nbsp;mph (215&nbsp;km/h) and potentially as strong as 160&nbsp;mph (260&nbsp;km/h), or a [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 5]] hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]].<ref name="garnet">{{cite web|author=Bossak|year=2003|title=Early 19th Century U.S. Hurricanes: A GIS Tool and Climate Analysis|publisher=Florida State University|accessdate=2007-07-02|url=http://garnet.acns.fsu.edu/~jelsner/HHITProject/HHITStormList.txt}}</ref> Late on September 2, the hurricane made landfall near [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] and later turned to the northeast to cross the [[Pamlico Sound]].<ref name="hpc">{{cite web|author=David Roth & Hugh Cobb|year=2001|title=Early Nineteenth Century Virginia Hurricanes|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|accessdate=2007-07-03|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/research/roth/vaerly19hur.htm}}</ref>

The hurricane accelerated northeastward, and passed over the [[Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA|Hampton Roads]] area early on September 3. After crossing the [[Chesapeake Bay]], the cyclone traversed the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] near the Atlantic coastline,<ref name="hpc"/> and at around 1500&nbsp;[[UTC]] the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] passed directly over [[Cape Henlopen]], [[Delaware]]; a thirty minute period of calm was reported. It continued across the [[Delaware Bay]] and later passed over [[Cape May, New Jersey]], where a fifteen minute calm was reported.<ref name="ludlum1">{{cite web|author=David Ludlum|url=http://garnet.acns.fsu.edu/~jelsner/HHITProject/HHITyears/1821/storm1_pt1_ludlum.pdf|title=The Norfolk and Long Island Hurricane - Sept. 3-4 - Pt. 1|accessdate=2007-07-04|format=PDF}}</ref> Modern researchers estimate it was a Category&nbsp;3 or Category&nbsp;4 hurricane upon striking New Jersey, one of the few hurricanes to [[List of New Jersey hurricanes|hit the state]].<ref name="cat3">{{cite web|author=Alexander Lane|year=2005|title=What if it happened here?|publisher=New Jersey Star Ledger|accessdate=2007-07-04|url=http://www.icnj.org/SiteDocuments/News/9-4-2005/whatifithappenedheresl_9-4-2005.htm}}</ref><ref name="cat4">{{cite web|author=Protectingnewjersey.org|year=2006|title=New Jersey: Exposed and Unprepared|accessdate=2007-07-04|url=http://www.protectingnewjersey.org/Index.asp?PFID=21&PID=79}}</ref> Moving ashore at very low tide,<ref name="sediment" /> it paralleled the state's coastline just inland, and after exiting into [[Lower New York Bay]] the hurricane made landfall on New York City at around 1930&nbsp;UTC on September 3; this makes it the only major hurricane to directly hit the city.<ref name="ho2"/> A minimal hurricane in 1893 also made landfall on New York City.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2006|title=Continental U.S. hurricanes: 1851-1914|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2008-01-10|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/usland1851-1914-gt.txt|format=TXT}}</ref> One modern researcher estimates the hurricane was moving at a forward speed of 35&nbsp;mph (55&nbsp;km/h), and upon moving ashore had a pressure of 965&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]].<ref name="ho2"/> The hurricane continued northeastward through [[New England]], and after entering [[Massachusetts]] on September 4 its exact path was unknown;<ref name="ludlum3">{{cite web|author=David Ludlum|url=http://garnet.acns.fsu.edu/~jelsner/HHITProject/HHITyears/1821/storm1_pt3_ludlum.pdf|title=The Norfolk and Long Island Hurricane - Sept. 3-4 - Pt. 3|accessdate=2007-07-04|format=PDF}}</ref> one researcher estimated the cyclone tracked northeastward until losing its identity over southeastern [[Maine]],<ref name="hpc"/> while another assessed the storm as passing far to the west of Maine.<ref name="cotterly">{{cite web|author=Cotterly|year=1999|title=1821 New England Hurricane|accessdate=2007-07-04|url=http://garnet.acns.fsu.edu/~jelsner/HHITProject/HHITyears/1821/storm1_pt3_other.pdf}}</ref> 

Based on the arrangement of effects in New England, meteorologist [[William Charles Redfield|William C. Redfield]] deduced that the wind field and center of tropical cyclones are circular; previously the winds were believed to be in a straight line.<ref name="cotterly"/>

==Impact==
{{Quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote= The continuous cataracts of rain swept impetuously along darkening the expanse of vision and apparently confounding the heaven, earth and seas in a general chaos|source=Norfolk Herald<ref name="hpc"/>}}
In [[North Carolina]], a powerful [[storm surge]] flooded large portions of [[Portsmouth Island, North Carolina|Portsmouth Island]]; residents estimated the island would have been completely under water had the worst of the storm lasted for two more hours. Strong winds occurred across eastern North Carolina, resulting in at least 76&nbsp;destroyed houses. Numerous people were killed in [[Currituck, North Carolina|Currituck]].<ref name="ludlum1"/>

The strongest winds of the hurricane lasted for about an hour in southeastern [[Virginia]], after which the storm rapidly abated. Several houses were completely destroyed, with many others receiving moderate to severe damage. The winds destroyed most of the roof of the courthouse, and uprooted trees across the region; fallen tree limbs damaged a stone bridge in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]. The hurricane produced a strong storm surge along the Virginia coastline, which reached 10&nbsp;feet (3&nbsp;m) at [[Accomack County, Virginia|Pungoteague]] on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]]. The storm surge, which reached several hundred yards inland, destroyed two bridges and flooded many warehouses along the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]]. Rough waves grounded the [[USS Guerriere (1814)|USS ''Guerriere'']] and the [[USS Congress (1799)|USS ''Congress'']], and also destroyed several schooners and brigs. Along the [[Eastern Shore of Virginia|eastern shore]], the storm surge flooded barrier islands along the Atlantic coastline, causing severe crop damage and downing many trees. Several houses were destroyed, and at Pungoteague the impact of the hurricane was described as "unexampled destruction"; five people drowned in [[Chincoteague, Virginia|Chincoteague]]. Considered one of the most violent hurricanes on record in the Mid-Atlantic, the hurricane caused $200,000 in damage in Virginia (1821&nbsp;USD, $3.1&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD).<ref name="hpc"/>

Gale force winds affected the Delmarva Peninsula; on [[List of islands of Maryland|Poplar Island]] in [[Talbot County, Maryland]], winds peaked at 1600&nbsp;[[UTC]] on September 3.<ref name="ludlum1"/> The strongest winds were confined to the Atlantic coastline, with outer [[Squall|rainbands]] producing heavy rainfall in [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Baltimore, Maryland]].<ref name="ludlum2">{{cite web|author=David Ludlum|url=http://garnet.acns.fsu.edu/~jelsner/HHITProject/HHITyears/1821/storm1_pt2_ludlum.pdf|title=The Norfolk and Long Island Hurricane - Sept. 3-4 - Pt. 2|accessdate=2007-07-07|format=PDF}}</ref> Fierce winds were observed in [[Cape Henlopen]], [[Delaware]], with the strongest gales occurring after the eye passed over the area.<ref name="ludlum1"/>

Upon making landfall on [[Cape May, New Jersey]], the cyclone produced a 5&nbsp;foot (1.5&nbsp;m) storm surge on the [[Delaware Bay]] side of the city.<ref name="ludlum2"/> Lasting for several hours, the hurricane force winds were described as "[blowing] with great violence",<ref name="ludlum1"/> causing widespread devastation across the region. In [[Little Egg Harbor]], its passage caused damage to the port. Strong winds reached as far inland as [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], where winds of over 40&nbsp;mph (60&nbsp;km/h) downed trees and chimneys; in the city, precipitation accrued to 3.92&nbsp;inches (99.6&nbsp;mm). Further to the north, the hurricane destroyed a windmill at [[Bergen Point, New Jersey]].<ref name="ludlum2"/> Though the hurricane struck at low tide, it produced a storm surge of over 29&nbsp;feet (9&nbsp;m) along several portions of the New Jersey coastline, causing significant [[overwash]].<ref name="sediment"/>

The hurricane produced a [[storm surge]] of 13&nbsp;feet (4&nbsp;m) in only one hour at [[Battery Park]]. [[Manhattan Island]] was completely flooded to [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]]; one hurricane researcher remarked that the storm surge flooding would have been much worse, had the hurricane not struck at low tide.<ref>{{cite web|author=Aaron Naparstek|date=2005-07-20|title=The Big One for New York City|publisher=The New York Press|accessdate=2008-01-10|url=http://www.nypress.com/18/29/news&columns/aaronnaparstek.cfm}}</ref> However, few deaths were reported in the city, since the flooding affected neighborhoods much less populated than today.<ref>{{cite web|author=New York City Office of Emergency Management|title=Early New York Hurricanes|accessdate=2008-01-10|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/oem/html/hazards/storms_hurricanehistory.shtml}}</ref> The hurricane brought light rainfall as it passed New York City, though strong winds left severe damage across the city. High tides occurred along the [[Hudson River]]. Strong waves and winds blew many ships ashore along [[Long Island]]. One ship sank, killing 17&nbsp;people. Along Long Island, the winds destroyed several buildings and left crops destroyed.<ref name="ludlum2"/> 

In [[New England]], the hurricane produced widespread gale force winds, with damage greatest in [[Connecticut]].<ref name="ludlum3"/>  The lighthouse in [[Black Rock (Bridgeport)|Black Rock]], Connecticut, was destroyed.<ref name="ludlum2"/> Elsewhere in the state, the winds damaged or destroyed churches, houses and small buildings. Moderate crop damage to fruit was reported as well. Strong winds extended into eastern [[Massachusetts]], though little damage was reported in the [[Boston]] area.<ref name="ludlum3"/>
