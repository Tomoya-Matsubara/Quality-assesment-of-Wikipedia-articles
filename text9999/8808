'''''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial''''' (often referred to simply as '''''E.T.''''') is a 1982 American [[science fiction film]] co-produced and directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], written by [[Melissa Mathison]] and starring [[Henry Thomas]], [[Dee Wallace]], [[Robert MacNaughton]], [[Drew Barrymore]], and [[Peter Coyote]]. It tells the story of Elliott (played by Thomas), a lonely boy who befriends an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]], dubbed "E.T.", who is stranded on Earth. Elliott and his siblings help the extraterrestrial return home while attempting to keep it hidden from their mother and the government.

The concept for ''E.T.'' was based on an imaginary friend Spielberg created after his parents' divorce in 1960. In 1980, Spielberg met Mathison and developed a new story from the stalled science fiction/horror film project ''[[Night Skies]]''. The film was shot from September to December 1981 in [[California]] on a budget of US$10.5 million. Unlike most motion pictures, the film was shot in roughly chronological order, to facilitate convincing emotional performances from the young cast. 

Released by [[Universal Pictures]], ''E.T.'' was a [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], surpassing ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' to become the highest-grossing film of all time<U+2014>a record it held for ten years until ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', another Spielberg-directed film, surpassed it in 1993. Critics acclaimed it as a timeless story of friendship, and it ranks as the [[Films considered the greatest ever#Particular genres or media|greatest science fiction film ever made]] in a [[Rotten Tomatoes]] survey. The film was re-released in 1985, and then again in 2002 to celebrate the film's 20th anniversary, with altered shots and additional scenes.

==Plot==
The film opens in a California forest as a group of [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]] botanists collect [[flora]] samples. U.S. government agents appear on the scene, and the aliens flee in their spaceship, mistakenly leaving one of their own behind. The scene shifts to a suburban home, where a 10-year-old boy named Elliott is trying to hang out with his 16-year-old brother Michael and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, Elliott discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The creature promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott lures the alien from the forest to his bedroom using a trail of [[Reese's Pieces]] candy. Before he goes to sleep, Elliott realizes the alien is imitating his movements.

Elliott feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with the alien. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister Gertie meet the alien. They decide to keep him hidden from their mother. When they ask it about its origin, the alien levitates several balls to represent its solar system and then demonstrates its powers by reviving a dead flower plant.

At school the next day, Elliott begins to experience a psychic connection with the alien, including exhibiting signs of intoxication due to the alien drinking beer, and he begins freeing all the frogs in a biology class. As the alien watches [[John Wayne]] kiss [[Maureen O'Hara]] in ''[[The Quiet Man]]'', Elliott kisses a girl he likes.

[[File:ET Communicator Cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Makeshift communicator used by E.T. to phone home. Among its parts is a Speak & Spell, an umbrella lined with tinfoil, and a coffee can filled with other electronics.]]

The alien learns to speak English by repeating what Gertie says as she watches ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and, at Elliott's urging, dubs itself "E.T." E.T. reads a comic strip where [[Buck Rogers]], stranded, calls for help by building a makeshift communication device, and is inspired to try it himself. He gets Elliott's help in building a device to "phone home" by using a [[Speak & Spell (toy)|Speak & Spell]] toy. Michael notices that E.T.'s health is declining and that Elliott is referring to himself as "we". 

On Halloween, Michael and Elliott dress E.T. as a ghost so they can sneak him out of the house. Elliott and E.T. ride a bicycle to the forest, where E.T. makes a successful call home. The next morning, Elliott wakes up in the field, only to find E.T. gone, so he returns home to his distressed family. Michael searches for and finds E.T. dying in a ditch and takes him to Elliott, who is also dying. Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her son's illness and the dying alien, just as government agents invade the house.

Scientists set up a medical facility there, quarantining Elliott and E.T. Their link disappears and E.T. then appears to die while Elliott recovers. A grief-stricken Elliott is left alone with the motionless alien when he notices a dead flower, the plant E.T. had previously revived, coming back to life. E.T. reanimates and reveals that his people are returning. Elliott and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Michael's friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bicycle. Suddenly facing a dead end, they escape as E.T. uses [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]] to lift them into the air and toward the forest.

Standing near the spaceship, E.T.'s heart glows as he prepares to return home. Mary, Gertie, and "Keys", a government agent, show up. E.T. says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, as Gertie presents E.T. with the flower that he had revived. Before entering the spaceship, E.T. tells Elliott "I'll be right here", pointing his glowing finger to Elliott's forehead. He then picks up the flower Gertie gave him, walks into the spaceship, and takes off, leaving a rainbow in the sky as Elliott (and the rest of them) watches the ship leave.

==Cast==
* [[Henry Thomas]] as Elliott, a lonely 10-year-old boy. Elliott longs for a good friend, whom he finds in E.T., who was left behind on Earth. Elliott adopts the stranded alien and they form a mental, physical, and emotional bond.
* [[Robert MacNaughton]] as Michael, Elliott's football-playing 16-year-old brother who often makes fun of him.
* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Gertie, Elliott's mischievous 5-year-old sister. She is sarcastic and initially terrified of E.T., but grows to love the alien.
* [[Dee Wallace]] as Mary, the children's mother, recently separated from her husband. She is mostly oblivious to the alien's presence in her house.
* [[Peter Coyote]] as "Keys", a government agent. His face is not shown until the film's second half, his name is never mentioned, and he is identified by the key rings that prominently hang from his belt. He tells Elliott that he has waited to see an alien since the age of 10.
* [[K. C. Martel]], [[Sean Frye]] and [[C. Thomas Howell]] as Greg, Steve and Tyler, Michael's friends. They help Elliott and E.T. evade the authorities during the film's climax.
* [[Erika Eleniak]] as the young girl Elliott kisses in class.

Having worked with [[Cary Guffey]] on ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', Spielberg felt confident in working with a cast composed mostly of child actors.<ref name="starry">{{Cite news| author = Steve Daly | title = Starry Role | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = March 22, 2002 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20036782_20037403_218829,00.html | accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> For the role of Elliott, he auditioned hundreds of boys<ref>{{harvnb|Brode|1995|p=117}}</ref> before Robert Fisk suggested [[Henry Thomas]] for the role.<ref name="20edition"/> Thomas, who auditioned in an [[Indiana Jones]] costume, did not perform well in the formal testing, but got the filmmakers' attention in an improvised scene.<ref name="starry"/> Thoughts of his dead dog inspired his convincing tears.<ref name = "Must own DVD">{{Cite news| author = Ian Nathan | title = The 100 DVDs You Must Own | page = 27 | work = [[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |date=January 2003}}</ref> [[Robert MacNaughton]] auditioned eight times to play Michael, sometimes with boys auditioning for Elliott.

The major voice work for E.T. was performed by [[Pat Welsh (actress)|Pat Welsh]], an elderly woman who lived in [[Marin County, California]]. Welsh smoked two packets of cigarettes a day, which gave her voice a quality that sound effects creator [[Ben Burtt]] liked. She spent nine-and-a-half hours recording her part, and was paid $380 by Burtt for her services.<ref name=brode/> Burtt also recorded 16 other people and various animals to create E.T.'s "voice". These included Spielberg; [[Debra Winger]]; Burtt's sleeping wife, who had a cold; a burp from his [[University of Southern California|USC]] film professor; and raccoons, sea otters, and horses.<ref>"The Making of E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"--from the "E.T.

Doctors working at the [[Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center|USC Medical Center]] were recruited to play the doctors who try to save E.T. after [[government agent]]s take over Elliott's home.

The scene featured Ford's character reprimanding Elliott for his behavior in science class and warning of the dangers of underage drinking; he is then taken aback as Elliott's chair rises from the floor, while E.T. is levitating his "phone" equipment up the staircase with Gertie.<ref name="20edition" />

==Production==

===Development===
After his parents' divorce in 1960, Spielberg filled the void with an imaginary alien companion. Spielberg said that E.T. was "a friend who could be the brother I never had and a father that I didn't feel I had anymore."<ref>{{harvnb|McBride|1997|p=72}}</ref> During 1978, Spielberg announced he would shoot a film entitled ''Growing Up'', which he would film in 28 days. The project was set aside because of delays on ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'', but the concept of making a small autobiographical film about childhood would stay with Spielberg.<ref name=brode>{{Cite book| author = Douglas Brode | title = The Films of Steven Spielberg | publisher = Citadel |year= 1995 | pages = 114<U+2013>127 | isbn= 0-8065-1540-6 | chapter=E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial}}</ref> He also thought about a follow-up to ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', and began to develop a darker project he had planned with [[John Sayles]] called ''[[Night Skies]]'' in which malevolent aliens terrorize a family.<ref name=brode/>

Filming ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' in [[Tunisia]] left Spielberg bored, and memories of his childhood creation resurfaced.<ref name="mcbride">{{Cite book| author = Joseph McBride | title = Steven Spielberg | publisher = Faber and Faber |year= 1997 | pages = 323<U+2013>38 | isbn=0-571-19177-0 | authorlink = Joseph McBride (writer)}}</ref> He told screenwriter [[Melissa Mathison]] about ''Night Skies'', and developed a subplot from the failed project, in which Buddy, the only friendly alien, befriends an [[autism|autistic]] child. Buddy's abandonment on Earth in the script's final scene inspired the ''E.T.'' concept.<ref name="mcbride"/> Mathison wrote a first draft titled ''E.T. and Me'' in eight weeks,<ref name="mcbride"/> which Spielberg considered perfect.<ref name="20edition">{{cite video | title = E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial: The 20th Anniversary Celebration | medium = DVD | publisher = Universal, directed by Laurent Bouzereau |year = 2002}}</ref> The script went through two more drafts, which deleted an "[[Eddie Haskell]]"-esque friend of Elliott. The chase sequence was also created, and Spielberg also suggested having the scene where E.T. got drunk.<ref name=brode/> [[Columbia Pictures]], which had been producing ''Night Skies'', met Spielberg to discuss the script. The studio passed on it, calling it "a wimpy [[Walt Disney]] movie", so Spielberg approached the more receptive [[Sid Sheinberg]], president of [[MCA Inc.|MCA]].<ref>{{Cite news| author = Deborah Caulfield | title = E.T.

Ed Verreaux created a $700,000 prototype for E.T., which Spielberg deemed useless.<ref name=brode/> [[Carlo Rambaldi]], who designed the aliens for ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'', was hired to design the [[animatronics]] of E.T.

===Filming===
''E.T.'' began shooting in September 1981.<ref name="exceptional">{{Cite news| author = David E. Williams | title = An Exceptional Encounter | pages = 34<U+2013>7 | work = [[American Cinematographer]] |date=January 1983}}</ref> The project was filmed under the cover name ''A Boy's Life'', as Spielberg did not want anyone to discover and plagiarize the plot. The actors had to read the script behind closed doors, and everyone on set had to wear an ID card.<ref name="starry"/> The shoot began with two days at a high school in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]], and the crew spent the next 11 days moving between locations at [[Northridge, Los Angeles|Northridge]] and [[Sunland-Tujunga, Los Angeles|Tujunga]].<ref name=brode/> The next 42 days were spent at Culver City's [[Culver Studios|Laird International Studios]], for the interiors of Elliott's home. The crew shot at a redwood forest near [[Crescent City, California|Crescent City]] for the production's last six days.<ref name=brode/><ref name="mcbride"/> Spielberg shot the film in roughly chronological order to achieve convincingly emotional performances from his cast. In the scene in which Michael first encounters the alien, the creature's appearance caused MacNaughton to jump back and knock down the shelves behind him. The chronological shoot gave the young actors an emotional experience as they bonded with E.T., making the hospital sequences more moving.<ref name="reunion"/> Spielberg ensured the puppeteers kept away from the set to maintain the illusion of a real alien. For the first time in his career, he did not [[storyboard]] most of the film, in order to facilitate spontaneity in the performances.<ref name="exceptional"/> The film was shot so adults, except for Dee Wallace, are never seen from the waist up in the film's first half, as a tribute to [[Tex Avery]]'s cartoons.<ref name="20edition" /> The shoot was completed in 61 days, four days ahead of schedule.<ref name="mcbride"/> According to Spielberg, the memorable scene where E.T. disguises himself as a stuffed animal in Elliott's closet was suggested by colleague [[Robert Zemeckis]], after he read a draft of the screenplay that Spielberg had sent him.<ref>James Lipton (host).

Longtime Spielberg collaborator [[John Williams]], who composed the film's musical score, described the challenge of creating a score that would generate sympathy for such an odd-looking creature. As with their previous collaborations, Spielberg liked every theme Williams composed and had it included. Spielberg loved the music for the final chase so much that he edited the sequence to suit it.<ref>{{cite video | people = [[John Williams]] | title = A Conversation with John Williams | medium = DVD  | publisher = Universal |year= 2002}}</ref> Williams took a  modernist approach, especially with his use of [[polytonality]], which refers to the sound of two different keys played simultaneously. The [[Lydian mode]] can also be used in a polytonal way.  Williams combined polytonality and the Lydian mode to express a mystic, dreamlike and heroic quality. His theme<U+2014>emphasizing coloristic instruments such as the harp, piano, celesta, and other keyboards, as well as percussion<U+2014>suggests E.T.'s childlike nature and his "machine."<ref>Karlin, Fred, and Rayburn Wright.

===Allegations of plagiarism===
There were allegations that the film was plagiarized from a 1967 script, ''[[The Alien (film)|The Alien]]'', by [[India]]n [[Cinema of Bengal|Bengali]] director [[Satyajit Ray]]. Ray stated, "''E.T.'' would not have been possible without my script of ''The Alien'' being available throughout the United States in mimeographed copies." Spielberg denied this claim, stating, "I was a kid in high school when his script was circulating in Hollywood."<ref>{{Cite news| author = John Newman | title = Satyajit Ray Collection receives Packard grant and lecture endowment | publisher = [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] | date = September 17, 2001 | url = http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/01-02/09-17/ray.html UC Santa Cruz Currents online article}}</ref> ''Star Weekend Magazine'' disputes Spielberg's claim, pointing out that he had graduated from high school in 1965 and began his career as a director in Hollywood in 1969.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Perceptions: Satyajit Ray and The Alien!|first=Obaidur|last=Rahman|journal=Star Weekend Magazine|volume=8|issue=70|date=May 22, 2009|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/magazine/2009/05/04/perceptions.htm|accessdate=2009-05-31}}</ref> Besides ''E.T.'', some believe that an earlier Spielberg film, ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', was also inspired by ''The Alien''.<ref name=timesofindia>{{cite news|title=Close encounters with native E.T. finally real|date=April 5, 2003|work=[[The Times of India]]|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/42443247.cms|accessdate=2009-03-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Satyajit Ray Collection Receives Packard Grant and Lecture Endowment|date=September 18, 2001|publisher=[[University of California]]|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/3572|accessdate=2009-06-02}}</ref>

''E.T.'' was the first major film to have been seriously affected by [[video piracy]]. The usual account is that the public in some areas were becoming impatient at long delays getting ''E.T.'' to their cinemas; an illegal group realized this, got hold of a copy of the film for a night by bribing a [[projectionist]], and made it into a video by projecting the film with a sound and video recording device. The resulting video was used as a master to run off very many copies, which were widely sold illegally.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/rwpattach.nsf/VAP/%28CFD7369FCAE9B8F32F341DBE097801FF%29~CPB+-+Report+of+the+Joint+Select+Committee+on+Video+Material+%28April+1988%29++VOL2PT1+Parl+Committee+Reports259015.pdf/$file/CPB+-+Report+of+the+Joint+Select+Committee+on+Video+Material+%28April+1988%29++VOL2PT1+Parl+Committee+Reports259015.pdf |title=Report of the Joint Select Committee|accessdate=2011-06-20}}</ref>

==20th anniversary version==
[[File:ET1982.jpg|thumb|The 20th anniversary version of the film replaces the guns, used by the police, with walkie-talkies.]]
An extended version of the film, including altered special effects, was released on March 22, 2002. Certain shots of E.T. had bothered Spielberg since 1982, as he did not have enough time to perfect the animatronics. [[Computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), provided by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), was used to modify several shots, including ones of E.T. running in the opening sequence and being spotted in the cornfield. The spaceship's design was also altered to include more lights. Scenes shot for but not included in the original version were introduced. These included E.T. taking a bath, and Gertie telling Mary that Elliott went to the forest on Halloween night. Spielberg did not add the scene featuring Harrison Ford, feeling that would reshape the film too drastically.  Spielberg became more sensitive about the scene where gun-wielding federal agents threaten Elliott and his escaping friends and had the guns digitally replaced with [[walkie-talkie]]s.<ref name="20edition"/>

At the premiere, John Williams conducted a live performance of the score.<ref>{{cite video | title = Live at the Shrine!

The two-disc DVD release which followed in October 22, 2002 contained the original theatrical and 20th Anniversary extended versions of the film.

Later, ''E.T.'' was re-released on DVD as a single-disc re-issue in 2005, featuring only the 20th Anniversary version.

In a June 2011 interview, Spielberg said that in the future

<blockquote>There's going to be no more digital enhancements or digital additions to anything based on any film I direct.... When people ask me which ''E.T.'' they should look at, I always tell them to look at the original 1982 ''E.T.'' If you notice, when we did put out ''E.T.'' we put out two ''E.T.''s. We put out the digitally enhanced version with the additional scenes and for no extra money, in the same package, we put out the original '82 version.

A 30th Anniversary edition was released on October 9, 2012 for [[Blu-ray]] and DVD, which included a fully restored version of the original film, re-instating the original animatronic close-ups and the shotguns.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/812016 |author=Universal Studios Home Entertainment |title=From Universal Studios Home Entertainment: E.T.

==Trivia==
In July 1982, during the film's first theatrical run, Spielberg and Mathison wrote a treatment for a sequel to be titled ''E.T. II: Nocturnal Fears''. It would have seen Elliott and his friends kidnapped by evil aliens and follow their attempts to contact E.T. for help. Spielberg decided against pursuing the sequel, feeling it "would do nothing but rob the original of its virginity".<ref name="midas touch">{{Cite news| author = John M. Wilson | title = E.T.

[[Atari, Inc.]] made a [[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (video game)|video game based on the film]] for the [[Atari 2600]]. Released in 1982, it was widely considered to be [[List of video games notable for negative reception|one of the worst video games ever made]]. [[William Kotzwinkle]], author of the film's [[novelization]], wrote a sequel, ''E.T.: The Book of the Green Planet'', which was published in 1985. In the novel, E.T. returns home to the planet Brodo Asogi, but is subsequently demoted and sent into exile. E.T. then attempts to return to Earth by effectively breaking all of Brodo Asogi's laws.<ref>{{harvnb|Kotzwinkle|1985|p=}}</ref> ''[[E.T.
