Between 1975 and 1977 the South African Railways (SAR), later renamed Spoornet and then [[Transnet Freight Rail]] (TFR), placed 100 '''Class 6E1, Series 6''' locomotives in service.<ref name="E&D diagram-book"/>

== Manufacturer ==
The South African '''Class 6E1, Series 6''' 3 kV DC electric locomotive was designed and built by Union Carriage and Wagon (UCW) in Nigel, [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UCW - Electric locomotives|url=http://www.ucw.co.za/pdf/electric_loco.pdf |publisher=The UCW Partnership|accessdate=30 September 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071012023401/http://www.ucw.co.za/pdf/electric_loco.pdf |archivedate = 12 October 2007}}</ref>

UCW did not allocate builder<U+2019>s numbers to the locomotives it built for the SAR. While the practice by most other locomotive builders was to allocate builder<U+2019>s numbers or works numbers to record the locomotives built by them, UCW simply used the SAR road numbers for their record keeping.<ref name="E&D diagram-book"/>

==Features==
To ensure the maximum transfer of power to the rails without causing wheel slip, the Class 6E1 was built with sophisticated traction links between the bogies and the frames and equipped with electronic wheel slip detection. These traction struts and linkages were to become a distinguishing feature of most subsequent South African electric locomotive models.<ref name="Paxton-Bourne">Locomotives of the South African Railways - A Concise Guide (Leith Paxton & David Bourne, 1985), p128-129, ISBN 0 86977 211 2</ref>

===Orientation===
These dual cab locomotives have a roof access ladder on one side only, just to the right of the cab access door. The roof access ladder end is marked as the number 2 end.<ref name="E&D diagram-book"/>

===6E1 Series identifying features===
The South African Class 6E1 was produced in eleven series over a period of nearly sixteen years, 960 units altogether, all built by UCW. This makes the 6E1 the most numerous single locomotive class ever to have seen service in South Africa and serves as ample proof of a highly successful design.<ref name="E&D diagram-book"/><ref name="Paxton-Bourne"/>

While some Class 6E1 series are visually indistinguishable from their predecessors or successors, some externally visible changes did occur over the years. Series 2 and all subsequent Class 6E1 series can be distinguished from Series 1 locomotives by their sandboxes that are not mounted on the bogies as before, but along the bottom edge of the locomotive body with the sandbox lids fitting into recesses in the body. The '''Series 6''' and Series 7 locomotives are visually indistinguishable from each other, but can be distinguished from the older series models by the rainwater beading above the small grilles on the sides just to the right of the side doors.<ref name="E&D diagram-book"/><ref name="Paxton-Bourne"/>

==Reclassification and rebuilding==
===Reclassification to Class 16E===
[[South African Class 16E|Class 16E]] locomotives were unmodified two-locomotive Class 6E1 pairs and could be considered as forerunners of the Class 18E. During 1990 and 1991 Spoornet made up several pairs of Series 6, 7, 8 or 9 Class 6E1 locomotives, semi-permanently coupled at their number 1 ends and reclassified and renumbered to Class 16E. Each locomotive pair shared a Class 16E number and each locomotive was marked as either the A or the B unit. Most were later either disbanded with the locomotives reverting to Class 6E1 and regaining their original numbers, or rebuilt to Class 18E.<ref name="Middleton"/>

===Rebuilding to Class 18E===
Beginning in 2000, Spoornet started a project of rebuilding Series 6 to 11 Class 6E1 locomotives to [[South African Class 18E, Series 1|Class 18E]] locomotives at the Koedoespoort Transwerk workshops. In the process the cab at the number 1 end was stripped of all controls in order to have a toilet installed to accommodate female crew, thereby forfeiting the loco's bi-directional ability.<ref>Information gathered from the rebuild files of individual locomotives at Transnet Rail Engineering<U+2019>s Koedoespoort shops</ref><ref name="Middleton">Railways of Southern Africa Locomotive Guide, 2002 Edition, (Compiled by John N. Middleton), p57, as amended by Combined Amendment List 4, January 2009</ref>
