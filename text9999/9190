"'''Bale Out: RevoLucian's Christian Bale Remix!'''" is a satirical [[dance remix]] by [[United States|American]] [[composer]] [[Lucian Piane]], also known as RevoLucian, released on February 2, 2009, to [[YouTube]] and [[Myspace]]. The piece utilizes audio from a July 2008 rant made by actor [[Christian Bale]] on the set of ''[[Terminator Salvation]]''. Various other elements are used in the remix, including pulsating dance track beats and clips of [[Barbra Streisand]] from a 2006 exchange with a supporter of then-[[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]], creating the impression of Streisand arguing with Bale.

The day after its release, the YouTube page for the song had been viewed over 200,000 times, and over a million times by February 5, 2009. The [[Associated Press]] called it a "hypnotic dance track",<ref name="lang" /> and [[United Press International]] noted it was "catchy", characterizing it as a "YouTube sensation".<ref name="upi" /> Gil Kaufman of [[MTV.com]] described the piece as "a techno-ripping, demonic dance party".<ref name="gilkaufman" /> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's website called the track "hilarious",<ref name="time" /> and ''[[Nine News]]'' characterized it as a "raging online success".<ref name="ninemsn" /> The director of ''Terminator Salvation'' [[McG]] liked the remix and put a copy of it on his [[iPod]],<ref name="grierson" /><ref name="borden" /> and Bale said he had heard the remix and thought "they did a good job".<ref name="kennedy" /><ref name="gq" />

In July 2008, [[Christian Bale]] was filming a scene in [[New Mexico]] for the film ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' with actress [[Bryce Dallas Howard]].

Prior to the release of Bale Out, [[Lucian Piane]] was known for a variety of satirical remixes, including tracks featuring [[List of Governors of Alaska|Alaska Governor]] [[Sarah Palin]], political commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] during an on-camera outburst in the 1980s, and [[Andrew Meyer]], who received national media attention when he was tasered by police during a speech given by [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[John Kerry]] at the [[University of Florida]].<ref name="lang" /><ref name="ninemsn" /><ref name="grierson" />

The [[Associated Press]] reported that Piane was "drawn to the musicality of Bale's rage-filled voice".<ref name="lang" /> Piane spent three hours working on the remix.<ref name="grierson" /> "When I heard Christian Bale flip out I had to remix the track.&nbsp;... It's good to hear that clubs have already started playing it as it is very funny," said Piane.<ref name="rantremixed" /> In an interview with ''[[LA Weekly]]'', Piane commented that he wants his remix remembered, instead of Bale's outburst: "We're all people in this world. So I figured, [instead of] remembering that one time Christian Bale went crazy on set, maybe people will remember the remix."<ref name="grierson" />

The "Bale Out" [[Mashup (music)|mashup]] incorporates audio clips of Bale lashing out, and Hurlbut responding "I was looking at the lights."<ref name="ninemsn" /> The chorus includes a clip of Bale saying "it's fucking distracting",<ref name="marsden" /> and "What don't you fuckin' understand?".<ref name="grierson" /> The [[sound collage]] includes clips of [[Barbra Streisand]] from a 2006 exchange with a supporter of former-President [[George W.
