The '''Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster''' took place on January 28, 1986 when [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']], a [[Space Shuttle]] operated by [[NASA]], consisting of the Challenger Orbiter, designated OV-099, an External Tank (ET) containing liquid hydrogen fuel and liquid oxygen oxidizer, and two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), broke apart 73 seconds into its flight leading to the deaths of its seven crew members. The [[spacecraft]] disintegrated over the [[Atlantic Ocean]], off the coast of central [[Florida]], United States at 11:39 a.m. [[North American Eastern Time Zone|EST]] (16:39 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). Disintegration of the shuttle stack began 73 seconds into its flight after an [[O-ring]] seal in its right [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster (SRB)]] failed at liftoff. The O-ring failure caused a breach in the SRB joint it sealed, allowing a flare (of pressurized hot gas from within the solid rocket motor) to reach the outside and impinge upon the adjacent SRB attachment hardware and [[Space Shuttle external tank|external fuel tank]]. Roughly 90 seconds into the launch,<!-- The exact time is readily available from web sites at nasa.gov --> the SRB breach flare led to the separation of the right-hand SRB's aft attachment and the [[structural failure]] of the external tank, dumping the liquid hydrogen fuel load all at once and causing a massive explosion as this fuel was immediately ignited by various present flame sources. [[aerodynamics|Aerodynamic]] forces promptly broke up the orbiter after this event caused loss of attitude<!--"Attitude" is the correct term here--> control. The crew compartment and many other vehicle fragments were eventually recovered from the ocean floor after a lengthy search and recovery operation. The crew were probably killed by impact of their crew compartment with the ocean surface, although they might have suffered lethal injuries from the forces of the disintegration. <!-- Verify that the crew compartment was recovered intact with the remains of all 7 crew inside. -->

The disaster resulted in a 32-month hiatus in the shuttle program and the formation of the [[Rogers Commission]], a special commission appointed by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] to investigate the accident. The Rogers Commission found that [[NASA]]'s [[organizational culture]] and decision-making processes had been a key contributing factor to the accident. NASA managers had known that contractor [[Morton Thiokol]]'s design of the SRBs contained a potentially catastrophic flaw in the O-rings since 1977, but they failed to address it properly. They also disregarded warnings from engineers about the dangers of launching on such a cold day and had failed to adequately report these technical concerns to their superiors. The Rogers Commission offered NASA nine recommendations that were to be implemented before shuttle flights resumed.

Many viewed the launch live due to the presence on the crew of [[Christa McAuliffe]], the first member of the [[Teacher in Space Project]]. Media coverage of the accident was extensive: one study reported that 85 percent of Americans surveyed had heard the news within an hour of the accident. The ''Challenger'' disaster has been used as a case study in many discussions of engineering safety and workplace ethics and inspired the 1990 television movie, ''[[Challenger (TV film)|Challenger]]''.

==Pre-launch conditions and delays==
{{details|Space Shuttle Challenger launch decision}}
[[Image:GPN-2004-00011.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ice on the launch tower hours before ''Challenger'' launch]]
''Challenger'' was originally set to launch from [[Kennedy Space Center]] in [[Florida]] at 2:42 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on January 22. However, delays suffered by the previous mission, [[STS-61-C]], caused the launch date to be pushed back to January 23 and then to January 24. Launch was then rescheduled to January 25 due to [[storm|bad weather]] at the [[Space Shuttle abort modes|Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL)]] site in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]]. NASA decided to use [[Casablanca]] as the TAL site, but because it was not equipped for night landings, the launch had to be moved to the morning ([[North American Eastern Time Zone|Florida time]]). Predictions of unacceptable weather at [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) caused the launch to be rescheduled for 9:37 a.m. EST on January 27. According to Malcolm McConnell's book, ''Challenger: A Major Malfunction,'' NASA normally would have launched with the predicted forecast of a 50 percent chance of rain if not for plans to have [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] stop over and watch the launch on his way to [[Honduras]]. 

The launch was delayed the next day by problems with the [[Space Shuttle Orbiter#Description|exterior access hatch]]. First, one of the microswitch indicators used to verify that the hatch was safely locked malfunctioned.<ref>McConnell, Malcolm. ''Challenger: A Major Malfunction,'' pages 150<U+2013>153.</ref> Then, a stripped bolt prevented the closeout crew from removing a closing fixture from the orbiter's hatch.<ref>McConnell, Malcolm. ''Challenger: A Major Malfunction,'' page 154.</ref> When the fixture was finally sawn off, crosswinds at the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] exceeded the limits for a [[Space Shuttle abort modes|Return to Launch Site (RTLS)]] abort.<ref>{{cite web| author=Rogers Commission report| title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' Accident, Volume 1, chapter 2| year=1986| url=http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch2.htm}}</ref> The crew waited for the winds to die down until the launch window finally ran out, forcing yet another scrub.

Forecasts for January 28 predicted an unusually cold morning, with temperatures close to {{convert|31|F|C}}, the minimum temperature permitted for launch. The low temperature had prompted concern from engineers at [[Morton Thiokol]], the contractor responsible for the construction and maintenance of the shuttle's SRBs. At a teleconference which took place on the evening of January 27, Thiokol engineers and managers discussed the weather conditions with NASA managers from Kennedy Space Center and [[Marshall Space Flight Center]]. Several engineers&mdash;most notably [[Roger Boisjoly]], who had voiced similar concerns previously&mdash;expressed their concern about the effect of the temperature on the resilience of the rubber O-rings that sealed the joints of the SRBs. Each SRB was constructed of six sections joined in three factory joints and three "field joints". The factory joints were welded, but the field joints--assembled in the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center--each used two rubber O-rings, a primary and a secondary (backup), to seal them. (Since the accident, SRB field joints now use three O-rings.) The seals of all of the SRB joints were required to contain the hot high-pressure gases produced by the burning solid propellant inside, forcing it out the nozzle at the aft end of each rocket. Thiokol engineers argued that if the O-rings were colder than {{convert|53|F|C}}, they did not have enough data to determine whether the joint would seal properly. This was an important consideration, since the SRB O-rings had been designated as a "Criticality 1" component&mdash;meaning that there was no backup if both the primary and secondary O-rings failed, and their failure would destroy ''Challenger'' and its crew. One argument of NASA people in contest to Thiokol's concerns was that if the primary O-ring failed the secondary O-ring would still seal, which was an illegitimate argument for a Criticality-1 component, and was nonetheless unproven. (As astronaut Sally Ride cited in questioning NASA managers before Congress, it is forbidden to rely on a backup for a Criticality-1 component. The backup is there to provide redundancy in case of unforeseen failure, not to replace the primary device, leaving no backup.)  The engineers at Thiokol also argued that the low overnight temperatures would almost certainly result in SRB temperatures below their redline of {{convert|40|F|C|abbr=on}}. However, they were overruled by Morton Thiokol management, who recommended that the launch proceed as scheduled.<ref name="rogers 5">{{cite web| author=Rogers Commission report| title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' Accident, Volume 1, chapter 5| year=1986| url=http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch5.htm}} </ref> Morton Thiokol management's decision was influenced by demands from NASA managers to prove that conditions were ''not'' safe for a launch, rather than prove that conditions were safe.  It later emerged in the aftermath of the accident that NASA managers frequently evaded safety regulations in order to maintain the launch manifest (schedule), despite public perceptions that the agency always maintained a "fail-safe" approach.

Due to the low temperature, a significant amount of ice built up on the [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39#Space shuttle usage|fixed service structure]] that stood beside the shuttle. The Kennedy Ice Team inadvertently pointed an infrared camera at the aft field joint of the right SRB and found the temperature to be only {{convert|8|F|C}}. This was believed to be the result of supercooled air blowing on the joint from the liquid oxygen tank vent. It was much lower than the air temperature and far below the design specifications for the O-rings. However, the {{convert|8|F|C}} reading was later determined to be erroneous, the error caused by not following the temperature probe manufacturer's instructions. Tests and adjusted calculations later confirmed that the temperature of the joint was not substantially different than the ambient temperature.<ref name="feynman 1">{{cite book | last = Feynman| first = Richard| title = What Do You Care What Other People Think| pages = 165<U+2013>166 }}</ref>

Although the Ice Team had worked through the night removing ice, engineers at [[Rockwell International]], the shuttle's prime contractor, still expressed concern. Rockwell engineers watching the pad from their headquarters in [[Downey, California]] were horrified when they saw the amount of ice. They feared that during launch, ice might be shaken loose and strike the shuttle's thermal protection tiles, possibly due to the aspiration induced by the [[jet (fluid)|jet]] of [[exhaust gas]] from the SRBs. [[Rocco Petrone]], the head of Rockwell's space transportation division, and his colleagues viewed this situation as a launch constraint, and told Rockwell's managers at the Cape that Rockwell could not support a launch. However, Rockwell's managers at the Cape voiced their concerns in a manner that led Houston-based mission manager [[Arnold Aldrich]] to go ahead with the launch. Aldrich decided to postpone the shuttle launch by an hour in order to give the Ice Team time to perform another inspection. After that last inspection, during which the ice appeared to be melting, ''Challenger'' was finally cleared to launch at 11:38 a.m. EST.<ref name="rogers 5"/>

At 6.6&nbsp;seconds before liftoff, as normal, the three [[space shuttle main engine]]s (SSME) ignited. Until liftoff actually occurs, the SSMEs can be safely shut down and the launch aborted if necessary. At liftoff time (T=0, which was at 11:38:00.010 EST), the three SSMEs were at 100% of their original rated performance, and began throttling up to 104% under computer control. At this moment, the two SRBs were ignited and hold-down bolts were released with explosives, freeing the vehicle from the pad. With the first vertical motion of the vehicle, the gaseous hydrogen vent arm retracted from the [[Space Shuttle external tank|External Tank (ET)]] but failed to latch back. Review of film shot by pad cameras showed that the arm did not re-contact the vehicle, and thus it was ruled out as a contributing factor in the accident.<ref name="rogers n"/> The post-launch inspection of the pad also revealed that kick springs on four of the hold-down bolts were missing, but they were similarly ruled out as a possible cause.<ref name="tv team">{{cite video | people= Photo and TV Analysis Team Report| title =[http://www.archive.org/details/ChallengerAccidentandInvestigation Space Shuttle Challenger Accident Investigation] | publisher = STS-51L Data and Analysis Task Force | year = 1986}}</ref>
[[Image:Challenger (STS-51-L) Liftoff.ogg|thumb|Challenger lifting off (253 [[Kilobyte|kB]], [[ogg]]/[[Theora]] format)]]
Later review of launch film showed that at T+0.678, strong puffs of dark grey smoke were emitted from the right-hand SRB near the [[aft]] strut that attaches the booster to the ET. The last smoke puff occurred at about T+2.733. The last view of smoke around the strut was at T+3.375. It was later determined that these smoke puffs were caused by the opening and closing of the aft field joint of the right-hand SRB. The booster's casing had ballooned under the stress of ignition. As a result of this ballooning, the metal parts of the casing bent away from each other, opening a gap through which hot gases above 5,000&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (2,760&nbsp;<U+00B0>C) leaked out. This had occurred in previous launches, but each time the primary o-ring had shifted out of its groove and formed a seal.  Although the SRB was not designed to function this way, it appeared to work well enough and Morton-Thiokol changed the design specs to accommodate this process, known as extrusion.

Unfortunately, while extrusion was taking place, hot gases would leak past, a process called blow-by, damaging the O-rings until a seal was made.  Investigations into the matter by Morton-Thiokol engineers determined that the amount of damage to the O-rings was directly related to the time it took for extrusion to occur, and that cold weather, by causing the O-rings to harden, lengthened the time of extrusion. (The redesigned SRB field joint used subsequent to the ''Challenger'' accident uses an additional interlocking mortise and tang with a third O-ring, mitigating blow-by.)

The morning of the disaster the O-ring was too cold to seal in time. The secondary O-ring was not in its seated position due to the metal bending. There was now no barrier to the gases, and both O-rings were vaporized across 70 degrees of arc. However, [[aluminium oxide]]s from the burned solid propellant sealed the damaged joint, temporarily replacing the O-ring seal before actual flame rushed through the joint.

As the vehicle cleared the tower, the SSMEs were operating at 104% of their rated maximum thrust, and control switched from the [[Launch Control Center]] (LCC) at Kennedy to the Mission Control Center (MCC) in [[Houston, Texas]]. To prevent [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] forces from structurally overloading the orbiter, at T+28 the SSMEs began throttling down to limit the velocity of the shuttle in the dense [[troposphere|lower atmosphere]], as per normal operating procedure. At T+35.379, the SSMEs throttled back further to the planned 65%. Five seconds later, at about 19,000&nbsp;feet (5800&nbsp;m), ''Challenger'' passed through [[Mach number|Mach 1]]. At T+51.860, the SSMEs began throttling back up to 104% as the vehicle passed beyond [[Max Q]], the period of maximum aerodynamic pressure on the vehicle.

===Plume===
[[Image:Challenger STS-51-L-launch.jpg|thumb|upright|Plume on right SRB]]
Just as the shuttle approached [[Max Q]], it slammed through the most intense [[wind shear]] ever experienced to date in the space shuttle program.

At T+58.788, a tracking film camera captured the beginnings of a [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] near the aft attach strut on the right SRB. Unknown to those on ''Challenger'' or in Houston, hot gas had begun to leak through a growing hole in one of the right-hand SRB's joints. The force of the wind shear shattered the temporary oxide seal that had taken the place of the damaged O-rings, removing the last barrier to flame rushing through the joint. Had it not been for the wind shear, the fortuitous oxide seal might have held through booster burnout.

Within a second, the plume became well defined and intense. Internal pressure in the right SRB began to drop because of the rapidly enlarging hole in the failed joint, and at T+60.238 there was visual evidence of flame coming through the joint and impinging on the external tank.<ref name="timeline"/>

At T+64.660, the plume suddenly changed shape, indicating that a leak had begun in the [[liquid hydrogen]] tank, located in the aft portion of the external tank. The nozzles of the main engines pivoted under computer control to compensate for the unbalanced thrust produced by the booster burn-through. The pressure in the shuttle's external liquid hydrogen tank began to drop at T+66.764, indicating the effect of the leak.<ref name="timeline"/>

At this stage the situation still seemed normal both to the astronauts and to flight controllers. At T+68, the [[Flight controller#Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM)|CAPCOM]] Richard Covey informed the crew that they were "go at throttle up", and Commander [[Dick Scobee]] confirmed the call. His response, "Roger, go at throttle up," was the last communication from ''Challenger'' on the air-to-ground loop.

===Vehicle breakup===
[[Image:Challenger - STS-51-L Explosion.ogg|thumb|Challenger breakup (346 [[Kilobyte|kB]], [[ogg]]/[[Theora]] format]]
At T+72.284, the right SRB apparently pulled away from the aft strut attaching it to the external tank. Later analysis of telemetry data showed a sudden lateral acceleration to the right at T+72.525, which may have been felt by the crew. The last statement captured by the crew cabin recorder came just half a second after this acceleration, when Pilot [[Michael J. Smith (astronaut)|Michael J. Smith]] said "Uh oh."<ref name="lewis">{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Richard S.|title=Challenger: The Final Voyage|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1988|pages=16|isbn=023106490X}}</ref> Smith may also have been responding to onboard indications of main engine performance, or to falling pressures in the external fuel tank.

At T+73.124, the aft dome of the liquid hydrogen tank failed, producing a propulsive force that pushed the hydrogen tank into the liquid oxygen tank in the forward part of the ET. At the same time, the right SRB rotated about the forward attach strut, and struck the [[Space Shuttle external tank#Intertank|intertank]] structure.

The breakup of the vehicle began at T+73.162 seconds and at an altitude of 48,000&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (14.6&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]).<ref name="kerwin">{{cite web| author=Kerwin, Joseph P.| title=''Challenger'' crew cause and time of death| year=1986| url=http://history.nasa.gov/kerwin.html| accessmonthday=July 4 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> With the external tank disintegrating (and with the semi-detached right SRB contributing its thrust on an anomalous vector), ''Challenger'' veered from its correct attitude with respect to the local air flow and was immediately torn apart by abnormal aerodynamic forces resulting in a [[Load factor (aerodynamics)|load factor]] of up to 20[[g-force|''g'']] &mdash; well over its design limit of 5 g. The two SRBs, which can withstand greater aerodynamic loads, separated from the ET and continued in uncontrolled powered flight for another 37&nbsp;seconds. The SRB casings were made of half-inch (12.7&nbsp;mm) thick steel and were much stronger than the orbiter and ET; thus, both SRBs survived the breakup of the space shuttle stack, even though the right SRB was still suffering the effects of the joint burn-through that had set the destruction of ''Challenger'' in motion.<ref name="tv team" />  <!-- Is there any public record of whether, and where, these SRBs, or their RSRM segments, were reused? -->

===Post-breakup flight controller dialog===
[[Image:STS-51L riadiace stredisko.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jay Greene]] at his console after the breakup of ''Challenger'']]
In Mission Control, there was a burst of static on the air-to-ground loop as ''Challenger'' disintegrated. Television screens showed a cloud of smoke and water vapor (the product of hydrogen combustion) where ''Challenger'' had been, with pieces of debris falling toward the ocean. At about T+89, flight director [[Jay Greene]] prompted his [[Flight Dynamics Officer#Flight Dynamics Officer (FIDO)|flight dynamics officer]] for information. The response was that "...the [[radar]] filters have discreting sources", a further indication that ''Challenger'' had broken into multiple pieces. The [[Flight controller#Ground Controller (GC)|ground controller]] reported "negative contact, loss of downlink" of radio and telemetry data from ''Challenger''. Greene ordered his team to "watch your data carefully" and look for any sign that the Orbiter had escaped.

At T+110.250, the [[Range Safety Officer]] (RSO) at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] sent radio signals that activated the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster#Range safety system|range safety system's]] "destruct" packages on board both solid rocket boosters. This was a normal contingency procedure, undertaken because the RSO judged the free-flying SRBs a possible threat to land or sea. The same destruct signal would have destroyed the External Tank had it not already disintegrated.<ref> {{cite web| author=Rogers Commission report| title=Rogers Commission report, Volume I, chapter 9, Range Safety Activities, January 28, 1986| year=1986| url=http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch9.htm| accessmonthday=July 4 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

"Flight controllers here looking very carefully at the situation," reported public affairs officer Steve Nesbitt. "Obviously a major malfunction. We have no downlink." After a pause, Nesbitt said, "We have a report from the Flight Dynamics Officer that the vehicle has exploded."

Greene ordered that contingency procedures be put into effect at Mission Control; these procedures included locking the doors of the control center, shutting down telephone communications with the outside world, and following checklists that ensured that the relevant data were correctly recorded and preserved.

===No "explosion"===
[[Image:Sts33-e204.jpg|image|thumb|''Challenger'' begins to disintegrate.]]
Contrary to the flight dynamics officer's initial statement, the shuttle and external tank did not actually "[[explosion|explode]]". Instead they rapidly disintegrated under tremendous aerodynamic forces, since the shuttle was slightly past "[[Max Q]]", or maximum aerodynamic pressure. When the external tank disintegrated, the fuel and oxidizer stored within it were released, producing the appearance of a massive fireball. However, according to the NASA team that analyzed imagery after the accident, there was only "localized combustion" of propellant.<ref name="tv team"/> Instead, the visible cloud was primarily composed of vapor and gases resulting from the release of the shuttle's [[liquid oxygen]] and liquid hydrogen propellant. Stored in [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] conditions, the liquid hydrogen could not have ignited rapidly enough to trigger an "explosion" in the traditional sense of a ''[[detonation]]'' (as opposed to a ''[[deflagration]]'', which was what occurred). Had there been a true explosion, the entire shuttle would have been instantly destroyed, killing the crew at that moment. The more robustly constructed crew cabin and SRBs survived the breakup of the launch vehicle; while the SRBs were subsequently detonated remotely, the detached cabin continued along a [[ballistics|ballistic]] trajectory, and was observed exiting the cloud of gases at T+75.237.<ref name="tv team"/> Twenty-five seconds after the breakup of the vehicle, which occurred at 48,000&nbsp;feet (14.6&nbsp;km), the trajectory of the crew compartment peaked at a height of 65,000&nbsp;feet (19.8&nbsp;km).<ref name="kerwin"/>

===Cause and time of death===
During vehicle breakup, the crew cabin detached in one piece and slowly tumbled. NASA estimated separation forces at about 12 to 20 times the force of gravity [[g-force|''(g)'']] very briefly; however, within two seconds, the forces on the cabin had already dropped to below 4&nbsp;''g'', and within ten seconds the cabin was in [[free fall]]. These forces were likely insufficient to cause major injury. At least some of the astronauts were likely alive and briefly conscious after the breakup, because three of the four [[Personal Egress Air Packs]] (PEAPs) on the flight deck were found to have been activated. Investigators found their remaining unused air supply roughly consistent with the expected consumption during the 2&nbsp;minute 45&nbsp;second post-breakup trajectory. Whether the astronauts remained conscious long after the breakup is unknown, and largely depends on whether the detached crew cabin maintained pressure integrity. If it did not, time of useful consciousness at that altitude is just a few seconds; the PEAPs supplied only unpressurized [[air]], and hence would not have helped the crew to retain consciousness. The crew cabin hit the ocean surface at roughly {{convert|334|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, causing an instantaneous deceleration of over 200&nbsp;''g'', far beyond the structural limits of the crew compartment or crew survivability levels.<ref name="kerwin"/>

On July 28, 1986, Rear Admiral [[Richard H. Truly]], NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Flight and a former astronaut, released a report from [[Joseph P. Kerwin]], biomedical specialist from the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]] in Houston, relating to the deaths of the astronauts in the accident. Dr. Kerwin, a veteran of the [[Skylab 2]] mission, had been commissioned to undertake the study soon after the accident. According to the Kerwin Report:

{{quote|The findings are inconclusive. The impact of the crew compartment with the ocean surface was so violent that evidence of damage occurring in the seconds which followed the explosion was masked. Our final conclusions are:
* the cause of death of the ''Challenger'' astronauts cannot be positively determined;
* the forces to which the crew were exposed during Orbiter breakup were probably not sufficient to cause death or serious injury; and
* the crew possibly, but not certainly, lost consciousness in the seconds following Orbiter breakup due to in-flight loss of crew module pressure.<ref name="kerwin"/>}} <!-- What exactly happened to the bodies? Its gory but it ought to be included. -->

===Crew escape was not possible===
{{Further|[[Space Shuttle abort modes#Ejection escape systems|Shuttle ejection escape systems]], [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Post-Challenger abort enhancements|Post-''Challenger'' abort enhancements]]}}.

During powered flight of the space shuttle, crew escape was not possible. While launch escape systems were considered several times during shuttle development, NASA's conclusion was that the shuttle's expected high reliability would preclude the need for one. Modified [[SR-71 Blackbird]] [[ejection seat]]s and full [[pressure suit]]s were used on the first four shuttle orbital missions, which were considered test flights, but they were removed for the operational missions that followed. Providing a launch escape system for larger crews was considered undesirable due to "limited utility, technical complexity and excessive cost in dollars, weight or schedule delays."<ref>{{cite web| author=Rogers Commission report| title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' Accident, Volume 1, chapter 9, page 180| year=1986| url=http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch9.htm}} </ref>

After the loss of ''Challenger'' the question was re-opened, and NASA considered several different options, including ejector seats, tractor rockets and bailing out through the bottom of the orbiter. However, NASA once again concluded that all of the launch escape systems considered would be impractical due to the sweeping vehicle modifications that would have been necessary and the resultant limitations on crew size. A bail-out system was designed to give the crew the option to leave the shuttle during gliding flight; however, this system would not have been usable in the ''Challenger'' scenario.<ref>{{cite web| author=Rogers Commission report| title=Implementation of the Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Recommendation VI| year=1987| url=http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v6ch6.htm}}</ref>

==Aftermath==

In the aftermath of the disaster, NASA was criticized for its lack of openness with the press. ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted on the day after the disaster that "neither Jay Greene, flight director for the ascent, nor any other person in the control room, was made available to the press by the space agency."<ref>{{cite news | last = Reinhold| first = Robert| title = At Mission Control, Silence and Grief Fill a Day Long Dreaded| work = New York Times| pages = A8| date = January 29, 1986 }}</ref> In the absence of reliable sources, the press turned to speculation; both ''The New York Times'' and [[United Press International]] ran stories suggesting that a fault with the external tank had caused an explosion, despite the fact that NASA's internal investigation had quickly focused in on the solid rocket boosters.<ref name="harwood 6">{{cite web | last = Harwood | first = William | title = Voyage Into History; Chapter Six: The Reaction | work = | year = 1986|url = http://web.archive.org/web/www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/51Lchap6reaction.html}} Archived by the Internet Archive on 2006-05-04.</ref><ref>See, for example, ''New Orleans Times-Picayune'', January 29, 1986, p. 1.</ref> "The space agency," wrote space news reporter William Harwood, "stuck to its policy of strict secrecy about the details of the investigation, an uncharacteristic stance for an agency that long prided itself on openness."<ref name="harwood 6"/>

=== Tributes ===

On the night of the disaster, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] had been scheduled to give his annual [[State of the Union Address]]. He initially announced that the address would go on as scheduled, but under mounting pressure he postponed the State of the Union Address for a week and gave a national address on the ''Challenger'' disaster from the [[Oval Office]] of the [[White House]].

The families of the ''Challenger'' crew organized the [[Challenger Center for Space Science Education]] as a permanent memorial to the crew. Fifty-two learning centers have been established by this non-profit organization.

In [[Huntsville, Alabama]], a city known for its strong association with NASA, the newest public middle school in the Huntsville City Schools system was named Challenger Middle School. 

The City of [[Palmdale, California|Palmdale]], the birthplace of the entire shuttle fleet, and its neighbor City of [[Lancaster, California]], both renamed ''10th Street East'', from Avenue M to [[Edwards Air Force Base]], to ''Challenger Way'' in honor of the lost shuttle and its crew. This was the road that the ''Challenger'', ''Enterprise'', and ''Columbia'' all were towed along in their initial move from [[Plant 42|U.S. Air Force Plant 42 ]] to Edwards AFB after completion since Palmdale airport had not yet installed the shuttle crane for placement of an orbiter on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft|747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]]. 

In addition, the City of Lancaster has built Challenger Middle School, and Challenger Memorial Hall at the former site of the Antelope Valley Fairgrounds, all in tribute to the ''Challenger'' shuttle and crew.

===Recovery of debris===
In the first minutes after the accident, recovery efforts were begun by NASA's Launch Recovery Director, who ordered the ships used by NASA for recovery of the solid rocket boosters to be sent to the location of the water impact. [[Search and rescue]] aircraft were also dispatched. At this stage, however, debris was still falling, and the Range Safety Officer (RSO) held both aircraft and ships out of the impact area until it was safe for them to enter. It was about an hour until the RSO allowed the recovery forces to begin their work.<ref name="rogers o">{{cite web| author=Rogers Commission report| title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Volume 3, Appendix O: NASA Search, Recovery and Reconstruction Task Force Team Report| year=1986| url=http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v3appo.htm}}</ref>

The search and rescue operations which took place in the first week after the ''Challenger'' accident were managed by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] on behalf of NASA, with assistance from the [[United States Coast Guard]], and mostly involved surface searches. According to the Coast Guard, "the operation was the largest surface search in which they had participated."<ref name="rogers o"/> This phase of operations lasted until February 7. Thereafter, recovery efforts were managed by a Search, Recovery, and Reconstruction team; its aim was to [[marine salvage|salvage]] debris that would help in determining the cause of the accident. [[Sonar]], divers, remotely-operated [[submersible]]s and manned submersibles were all used during the search, which covered an area of 480&nbsp;[[square nautical mile]]s (1600&nbsp;km<U+00B2>), and took place at depths of up to 1200&nbsp;feet (370&nbsp;m).

[[Image:GPN-2004-00009.jpg|thumb|left|Part of the left solid rocket booster, salvaged by search and recovery teams]]
By May 1, enough of the right solid rocket booster had been recovered to determine the original cause of the accident, and the major salvage operations were concluded. While some shallow-water recovery efforts continued, this was unconnected with the accident investigation; it aimed to recover debris for use in NASA's studies of the properties of materials used in spacecraft and launch vehicles.<ref name="rogers o"/> The recovery operation was able to pull 15&nbsp;tons of debris from the ocean; 55% of ''Challenger'', 5% of the crew cabin and 65% of the satellite cargo is still missing.<ref name="FamousPictures">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.famouspictures.org/mag/index.php?title=Challenger| title = Famous Pictures Magazine - Challenger| format = HTML | publisher = Famous Pictures Magazine| accessdate = 2007-07-19 | last= Lucas, Dean}}</ref> Some of the missing debris still washes up on Florida shores, such as on December 17, 1996, nearly eleven years after the incident, when two large pieces of the shuttle were found at [[Cocoa Beach, Florida|Cocoa Beach]].<ref>CNN.com (1996), [http://www.cnn.com/TECH/9612/17/challenger.debris/index.html Shuttle ''Challenger'' debris washes up on shore.] Retrieved on July 4, 2006.</ref> Under Title 18, United States Code, Section 641 it is against the law to be in possession of ''Challenger'' debris and any newly discovered pieces have to be turned in to NASA.<ref name="collectSpace">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-070501a.html| title = Seller admits to ''Challenger'' debris fraud| format = HTML | publisher = collectSpace.com| accessdate = 2007-07-19 | last=collectSpace.com }}</ref>

On board ''Challenger'' was an American flag, dubbed the [[Challenger flag]], that was sponsored by [[Scouting in Colorado|Boy Scout]] Troop 514 of [[Monument, Colorado]]. It was recovered intact, still sealed in its cargo bag.

The Australian aviator [[Bert Hinkler]], the second person (after [[Charles Lindbergh]]) to fly solo across the Atlantic, had a connection with the ''Challenger'' disaster.  A small piece of wood, a relic from one of Hinkler's hand-made gliders, was presented to the astronaut [[Don Lind]] in early 1986 as a token of appreciation for his coming to [[Bundaberg]] to contribute to the Hinkler Memorial Lectures.  Lind in turn gave it to [[Dick Scobee]], who took it with him on board the ''Challenger'', inside a small plastic bag that he placed in his locker.  After the explosion, the bag and the wood were recovered from the sea, identified, mounted, and later returned to the Hinkler Memorial Museum in Bundaberg.

==Rogers Commission investigation==
{{main|Rogers Commission}}
The '''Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' Accident''', also known as the [[Rogers Commission]] (after its chairman), was formed to investigate the disaster. The commission members were chairman and former Secretary of State [[William P. Rogers]], astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]] (Vice Chairman) and [[Sally Ride]], lawyer [[David C. Acheson]], aviation specialists [[Eugene E. Covert|Eugene Covert]] and [[Robert Hotz]], physicists [[Richard Feynman]], [[Albert D. Wheelon|Albert Wheelon]], and [[Arthur B. C. Walker, Jr.]], former Air Force general [[Donald Kutyna]], [[Robert W. Rummel|Robert Rummel]], [[Joseph F. Sutter|Joseph Sutter]], and test pilot [[Chuck Yeager]]. The commission worked for several months and published a report of its findings.
[[Image:Rogers Commisions arrive at Kennedy Space Center.jpg|thumb|left|Members of the [[Rogers Commission]] arrive at [[Kennedy Space Center]].]]
It found that the ''Challenger'' accident was caused by a failure in the [[O-ring]]s sealing the aft field joint on the right solid rocket booster, which allowed pressurized hot gases and eventually flame to "blow by" the O-ring and make contact with the adjacent external tank, causing structural failure. The failure of the O-rings was attributed to a design flaw, as their performance could be too easily compromised by factors including the low temperature on the day of launch.<ref>{{cite web| author=Rogers Commission report| title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' Accident, Volume 1, chapter 4, page 72| year=1986| url=http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch4.htm}}</ref> More broadly, the report also considered the contributing causes of the accident. Most salient was the failure of both NASA and its contractor, [[Morton Thiokol]], to respond adequately to the design flaw. The Commission found that as early as 1977, NASA managers had not only known about the flawed O-ring, but that it had the potential for catastrophe. This led the Rogers Commission to conclude that the ''Challenger'' disaster was "an accident rooted in history."<ref name="Rogers_vol6">{{cite web |author=Rogers Commission report |title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' Accident, Volume 1, chapter 6 |year=1986 |url=http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch6.htm}}</ref>

The report also strongly criticized the decision making process that led to the launch of ''Challenger'', saying that it was seriously flawed. The report cited evidence that NASA managers did not know of Thiokol's initial concerns about the effects of the cold on the O-rings, and did not understand that [[Rockwell International|Rockwell]] viewed the large amount of ice present on the pad as a constraint to launch.<ref>{{cite web| author=Rogers Commission report| title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' Accident, Volume 1, chapter 5| year=1986| url=http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch5.htm}}</ref> It concluded that:

{{cquote|...failures in communication... resulted in a decision to launch 51-L based on incomplete and sometimes misleading information, a conflict between engineering data and management judgments, and a NASA management structure that permitted internal flight safety problems to bypass key Shuttle managers.|20|20|Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' Accident|<ref name="Rogers report">{{cite web| author=Rogers Commission report| title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' Accident, Volume 1, chapter 5, page 82| year=1986| url=http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch5.htm}}</ref>}}

===Role of Richard Feynman===
{{main|Richard Feynman#Challenger disaster}}
{{Rquote|right|I took this stuff that I got out of your seal and I put it in ice water, and I discovered that when you put some pressure on it for a while and then undo it, it does not stretch back. It stays the same dimension. In other words, for a few seconds at least and more seconds than that, there is no resilience in this particular material when it is at a temperature of 32 degrees.|Richard Feynman|<ref name="NYT Feynman" />}}
One of the commission's best-known members was theoretical physicist Richard Feynman. His style of investigating with his own direct methods rather than following the commission schedule put him at odds with Rogers, who once commented, "Feynman is becoming a real pain." During a televised hearing, Feynman famously demonstrated how the O-rings became less resilient and subject to seal failures at ice-cold temperatures by immersing a sample of the material in a glass of ice water.<ref name="NYT_Feynman">{{cite web| url = http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/09/21/reviews/feynman-obit.html?_r=1&oref=slogin |title = Richard Feynman Dead at 69; Leading Theoretical Physicist|accessdate = 2007-01-28|author = Gleick, James|date = 1988-02-17|work = New York Times}}</ref>

Feynman was so critical of flaws in NASA's "safety culture" that he threatened to remove his name from the report unless it included his personal observations on the reliability of the shuttle, which appeared as Appendix F.<ref>[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/51-l/docs/rogers-commission/table-of-contents.html Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident] This link includes App. F.</ref><ref>{{cite book

<blockquote> It appears that there are enormous differences of opinion as to the
probability of a failure with loss of vehicle and of human life. The
estimates range from roughly 1 in 100 to 1 in 100,000. The higher
figures come from the working engineers, and the very low figures from
management. What are the causes and consequences of this lack of
agreement? Since 1 part in 100,000 would imply that one could put a
Shuttle up each day for 300 years expecting to lose only one, we could
properly ask "What is the cause of management's fantastic faith in the
machinery? .. It would appear that, for whatever purpose, be it for internal or
external consumption, the management of NASA exaggerates the
reliability of its product, to the point of fantasy." <ref>[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/51-l/docs/rogers-commission/Appendix-F.txt]</ref></blockquote> "For a successful technology," Feynman concluded, "reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled."<ref>Feynman, Richard P. (1986) [http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v2appf.htm Appendix F - Personal Observations on Reliability of Shuttle]</ref>

Feynman later reported that, although he had believed he was making discoveries about the problems at NASA on his own, he eventually realized that NASA or contractor personnel, in an apparent effort to anonymously focus attention on these problem areas, had carefully led him to the evidence which would support the conclusions on which he would later report.<ref name="AmaUK" /><ref>''The Best Mind Since Einstein'', [[BBC]]-TV & [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] Boston ([[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]]), 1993</ref>

==U.S. House Committee hearings==
The [[United States House Committee on Science|U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology]] also conducted hearings, and on October 29, 1986 released its own report on the ''Challenger'' accident.<ref>{{cite web| last=U.S House Committee on Science and Technology | title = Investigation of the Challenger Accident; Report of the Committee on Science and Technology, House of Representatives.|publisher = US Government Printing Office| date = October 29, 1986.| url = http://www.gpoaccess.gov/challenger/64_420.pdf | format = PDF }}</ref> The committee reviewed the findings of the Rogers Commission as part of its investigation, and agreed with the Rogers Commission as to the technical causes of the accident. However, it differed from the committee in its assessment of the accident's contributing causes.

{{Cquote|...the Committee feels that the underlying problem which led to the Challenger accident was not poor communication or underlying procedures as implied by the Rogers Commission conclusion. Rather, the fundamental problem was poor technical decision-making over a period of several years by top NASA and contractor personnel, who failed to act decisively to solve the increasingly serious anomalies in the Solid Rocket Booster joints.<ref>{{cite web| last=U.S House Committee on Science and Technology | title = Investigation of the Challenger Accident; Report of the Committee on Science and Technology, House of Representatives. | publisher = US Government Printing Office| date = October 29, 1986.| url = http://www.gpoaccess.gov/challenger/64_420.pdf | format = PDF}}, pp. 4<U+2013>5.</ref>}}

==NASA response==
After the ''Challenger'' accident, further shuttle flights were suspended, pending the results of the Rogers Commission investigation. Whereas NASA had held an internal inquiry into the [[Apollo 1]] fire in 1967, its actions after ''Challenger'' were more constrained by the judgments of outside bodies. The Rogers Commission offered nine recommendations on improving safety in the space shuttle program, and NASA was directed by President Reagan to report back within thirty days as to how it planned to implement those recommendations.<ref name="implementation report">{{cite web| title = Report to the President: Actions to Implement the Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident|publisher = NASA| date = July 14, 1986| url = http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/actions.pdf | format = PDF}}</ref>

In response to the commission's recommendation, NASA initiated a total redesign of the space shuttle's solid rocket boosters, which was watched over by an independent oversight group as stipulated by the commission.<ref name="implementation report"/> NASA's contract with Morton Thiokol, the contractor responsible for the solid rocket boosters, included a clause stating that in the event of a failure leading to "loss of life or mission," Thiokol would forfeit $10 million of its incentive fee and formally accept legal liability for the failure. After the ''Challenger'' accident, Thiokol agreed to "voluntarily accept" the monetary penalty in exchange for not being forced to accept liability.<ref name="Downlink">Jensen, Claus. ''No Downlink'', p. 355.</ref>

NASA also created a new Office of Safety, Reliability and Quality Assurance, headed as the commission had specified by a NASA associate administrator who reported directly to the NASA administrator. George Martin, formerly of [[Martin Marietta]], was appointed to this position.<ref>{{cite web| author=Rogers Commission report| title=Implementation of the Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Recommendation IV| year=1987| url=http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v6ch4.htm}}</ref> Former ''Challenger'' flight director [[Jay Greene]] became chief of the Safety Division of the directorate.<ref>[http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/GreeneJH/GreeneJH_Bio.pdf J.H. Greene], NASA Johnson Space Center Oral History Project Biographical Data Sheet.</ref>

The unrealistically optimistic launch schedule pursued by NASA had been criticized by the Rogers Commission as a possible contributing cause to the accident. After the accident, NASA attempted to aim at a more realistic shuttle flight rate: it added another orbiter, [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], to the space shuttle fleet in order to replace ''Challenger'', and it worked with the Department of Defense in order to put more satellites in orbit using [[expendable launch vehicle]]s rather than the shuttle.<ref>{{cite web| author=Rogers Commission report| title=Implementation of the Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Recommendation VII| year=1987| url=http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v6ch7.htm}}</ref> In August 1986, President Reagan also announced that the shuttle would no longer carry commercial [[satellite]] payloads. After a 32-month hiatus, the next shuttle mission, [[STS-26]], was launched on September 29, 1988.

Although significant changes were made by NASA after the ''Challenger'' accident, many commentators have argued that the changes in its management structure and organizational culture were neither deep nor long-lasting. After the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]] in 2003, attention once again focused on the attitude of NASA management towards safety issues. The [[Columbia Accident Investigation Board]] (CAIB) concluded that NASA had failed to learn many of the lessons of ''Challenger''. In particular, the agency had not set up a truly independent office for safety oversight; the CAIB felt that in this area, "NASA's response to the Rogers Commission did not meet the Commission's intent".<ref>{{cite web| author=Columbia Accident Investigation Board| title=Report of Columbia Accident Investigation Board, Volume I, chapter 7, page 178 (PDF)|year=2003| url=http://anon.nasa-global.speedera.net/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_chapter7.pdf}}</ref> The CAIB believed that "the causes of the institutional failure responsible for ''Challenger'' have not been fixed," saying that the same "flawed decision making process" that had resulted in the ''Challenger'' accident was responsible for [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'''s]] destruction seventeen years later.<ref>{{cite web| author=Columbia Accident Investigation Board| title=Report of Columbia Accident Investigation Board, Volume I, chapter 8, page 195 (PDF)|year=2003| url=http://anon.nasa-global.speedera.net/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_chapter8.pdf}}</ref>

==Impact==
===Media coverage===
While the presence of [[New Hampshire]] schoolteacher [[Christa McAuliffe]] on the ''Challenger'' crew had provoked some media interest, there was little live broadcast coverage of the launch. The only public live national coverage was provided by [[CNN]].  Due to McAuliffe's presence on the mission, NASA arranged for many U.S. public schools to view the launch live on [[NASA TV]].<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11031097/ 7 myths about the Challenger shuttle disaster - Space - MSNBC.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  As a result, many who were schoolchildren in the US in 1986 did in fact have the opportunity to view the launch live.  After the accident, however, seventeen percent of respondents in one study reported that they had seen the shuttle launch, while eighty-five percent said that they had learned of the accident within an hour. As the authors of the paper reported, "only two studies have revealed more rapid dissemination &#91;of news&#93;." (One of those studies was of the spread of news in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] after [[John F. Kennedy assassination|President Kennedy's assassination]], while the other was the spread of news among students at [[Kent State University|Kent State]] regarding [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt's]] death.)<ref name="diffusion">{{cite journal | last = Riffe | first = Daniel | coauthors = James Glen Stoval| title = Diffusion of News of Shuttle Disaster: What Role for Emotional Response? | journal = Journalism Quarterly | pages = 552 | publisher = Association for education in journalism and mass communication | date = Autumn 1989}}</ref> Another study noted that "even those who were not watching television at the time of the disaster were almost certain to see the graphic pictures of the accident replayed as the television networks reported the story almost continuously for the rest of the day."<ref name="children">{{cite journal | last = Wright| first = John C. | coauthors = Dale Kunkel; Marites Pinon; Aletha C.

Following the day of the accident, press interest remained high. While only 535 reporters were accredited to cover the launch, three days later there were 1467 reporters at Kennedy Space Center and another 1040 at Johnson Space Center. The event made headlines in newspapers worldwide.<ref name="harwood 6"/>

===Use as case study===
The ''Challenger'' accident has frequently been used as a case study in the study of subjects such as engineering safety, the ethics of [[whistle-blowing]], communications, group decision-making, and the dangers of [[groupthink]]. It is part of the required readings for engineers seeking a professional license in Canada<ref>{{cite book

Information designer [[Edward Tufte]] has used the ''Challenger'' accident as an example of the problems that can occur when information is presented unclearly. He argues that if [[Morton Thiokol]] engineers had more clearly presented the data that they had on the relationship between cold temperatures and burn-through in the solid rocket booster joints, they might have succeeded in persuading NASA managers to cancel the launch.<ref> [[Edward Tufte]]. (1997) ''Visual Explanations'', ISBN 0-9613921-2-6, Chapter 2.</ref> Tufte has also argued that poor presentation of information may have affected NASA decisions during the last flight of the ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Columbia]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB&topic_id=1|title= PowerPoint Does Rocket Science<U+2014>and Better Techniques for Technical Reports |accessdate=2007-01-28 |author=Tufte, Edward}}</ref>
