'''Goodison Park''' is a [[association football|football]] [[stadium]] located in [[Walton, Merseyside|Walton]], [[Liverpool]], England. The stadium has been home to [[Everton F.C.]] since its completion in 1892 and is one of the world's first [[soccer-specific stadium|purpose-built football grounds]]. The stadium is built in a residential area served by regular rail and bus services two miles from [[Liverpool]] city centre.

Goodison has undergone many changes over the years and it presently has an all-seated capacity of 40,157. Everton fans refer to the stadium as "The Grand Old Lady" and the abridged "Goodison". It has hosted more top-flight games than any other stadium in England and has hosted the maximum possible number of [[Premier League]] games as Everton have never been relegated from the Premier League.

As well as hosting Everton games, the stadium has been the venue for an [[FA Cup Final]] and numerous international fixtures, including several in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]]. The record for the highest attendance in women's football was set at Goodison Park in 1920. This game's high attendance resulted in women's football being banned by the Football Association for 50 years as they felt it threatened the men's game.

Goodison Park was conceived in unusual circumstances: two factions of politicians on the Everton board wanted to control the destiny of the club. Ultimately it was a tool devised by local [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politicians to gain voter's support. Everton F.C.'s relocation to Goodison Park was one of the earliest cases of a team moving to a new stadium for monetary benefit.

==History==
===Before Goodison Park===
[[Image:founding-father-john-houlding.jpg|thumb|[[John Houlding]], former Everton Chairman and Anfield landowner]]
{{Main|Stanley Park, Liverpool|Anfield}}

Everton originally played on an open pitch in the southeast corner of the newly laid out [[Stanley Park, Liverpool|Stanley Park]]. This is the site for the proposed [[Stanley Park Stadium|new Liverpool F.C. stadium]]. The first official match took place in 1879. In 1882, a Mr J. Cruit donated land at Priory Road which became the club's home for two years, with the necessary facilities required for professional clubs. Cruit asked the club to leave his land as the crowds became far too large and noisy.<ref name="Inglis" />

Everton moved to nearby [[Anfield]], where proper covered stands were built. Everton played at Anfield from 1884 until 1892.<ref>{{cite web | title= I: The Early Days (1878<U+2013>88)|publisher=Toffeeweb| url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/history/concise/1878-1888.asp| accessdate=17 November 2007}}</ref> During this time the club turned professional and entered teams in the [[FA Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/page/History/HistoryDetail/0,,10794~1357277,00.html|title = History of the Football League |date=3 August 2008|accessdate=17 April 2009|publisher=[[The Football League]]}}</ref> They became founding members of the [[Football League]] and won their first championship at the ground in 1890<U+2013>91.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/everton-the-begining.html?page=3|title=The Everton Story 1878<U+2013>1930|publisher=[[Everton F.C.]]|accessdate=17 April 2009}}</ref> Anfield's capacity grew to over 20,000 and the club hosted an international match between [[England national football team|England]] and [[Ireland national football team (1882<U+2013>1950)|Ireland]].

In the 1890s, a dispute about how the club was to be owned and run emerged with [[John Houlding]], Anfield's majority owner and Everton's Chairman, at the forefront.<ref name=Inglis>{{cite book |title=The Football Grounds of Britain |last=Inglis |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Inglis |year=1996 |publisher=CollinsWillow |isbn=0002184265 |page= |pages= |accessdate=5 April 2010 }}</ref> Houlding and the club's committee initially disagreed about the full purchase of the land at Anfield from minor land owner Mr Orrell and escalated into a principled disagreement of how the club was run. This caused Everton to leave Anfield and Houlding to form [[Liverpool F.C.]] to play at the newly vacant ground.<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |coauthors= |title=Liverpool Football Club is formed|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/history/timeline/1892-1917/liverpool-football-club-is-formed |date= |work= |publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] |accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref>

===Birth of Goodison Park===
On 15 September 1891, a General Meeting took place at Royal Street Hall, near Everton Valley. John Houlding proposed that a limited liability company be formed and that the company should purchase his land and local brewer Joseph Orrel's land for <U+00A3>9,237. This was most unusual for the time as football clubs were seen to be run under the guise of <U+201C>Sports Clubs<U+201D> with members paying an annual fee. The proposal was supported by [[W. E. Barclay|William Barclay]], the club secretary and a close friend of Houlding.<ref name="GoodisonInDepth">{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/goodison-in-depth.html|title=Goodison in depth|publisher=evertonfc.com|accessdate=1 January 2010}}</ref>

[[Image:George-mahon.jpg|thumb|left|alt=George Mahon <U+2014> The Father of Goodison Park| ''[[George Mahon (accountant)|George Mahon]] arranged for Everton to move to Goodison Park''.]]
[[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] politician and Everton board member [[George Mahon (accountant)|George Mahon]] fought the proposal and put forward his own amendment which was carried by the Everton board. At the time Everton's board contained both [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and Liberal Party councillors. Houlding and Mahon had previously clashed during local elections.<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |coauthors= |title=From Anfield to Goodison |url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/history/concise/1888-1915.asp |date= |work= |publisher=ToffeeWeb |accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |coauthors= |title=Anfield Split <U+2014> The Move to Goodison |url=http://www.evertoncollection.org.uk/exhibitions/the+anfield+split+%252d+the+move+to+goodison |date= |work= |publisher=evertoncollection.org.uk |accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref>

Both men agreed that Everton should operate as a [[limited liability company]] however they had different ideas about [[share (finance)|share]] ownership. Houlding suggested that 12,000 shares be created and each Everton board member be given one share each and the rest were to be sold to those who could afford it including Everton board members. Mahon disagreed and he put forward his proposal that would see 500 shares created, with no member carrying more than 10 shares and board members being given "7 or 8" shares. Mahon reasoned "we would rather have a large number of individual applications so that there will be more supporters of the club".<ref name="iykyh">{{cite web|url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/season/09-10/comment/fan/10231.html|title=And If You Know Your History|last=MacDonald|first=Ian|date=16 December 2008|publisher=ToffeeWeb.com|accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref>

A [[Extraordinary General Meeting|special general meeting]] was convened at the former [[Liverpool College]] building on Shaw Street on 25 January 1982. John Houlding's proposal was defeated once more and George Mahon suggested that Everton relocate to another site. A [[heckler]] shouted "You can't find one", Mahon responded "I have one in my pocket" and he revealed an option to lease Mere Green field, in Walton, [[Lancashire]], the site of what is today known as Goodison Park.<ref name="School of Science">{{cite book|last=Corbett|first=James|title=School of Science|date=|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-1405034319}}</ref>

The Liverpool press were largely partisan, the proposal was deemed to be a positive move for the club by the Liberal leaning ''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]'' who described Houlding's ousting as "having shaken off the incubus"<ref>{{cite news|title=The Everton club|date=19 March 1892|publisher=Liverpool Daily Post}}</ref> whereas the Tory-supporting ''[[Liverpool Courier]]'' and ''[[Liverpool Evening Express]]'' owned by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for Everton John A.Willox, a [[Trustee]] of the Licensed Victuallers<U+2019> and Brewers<U+2019> Association took Houlding's side. The ''Courier'' published letters regularly criticising Mahon's supporters <U+2014> many of which were anonymous.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=David|year=2006|title=Community Politics In Liverpool And The Governance Of Professional Football In The Late Nineteenth Century|journal=The Historical Journal|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=49|issue=3|pages=761<U+2013>788}}</ref>

The name Goodison Park was given to the stadium because the length of it was built against Goodison Road. The road was named after a civil engineer called George Goodison who provided a sewage report to the Walton Local Board in the mid 1800s and later became a local land owner.<ref name="iykyh"/>

{{Quote box
 | quote =Behold Goodison Park! no single picture could take in the entire scene the ground presents, it is so magnificently large, for it rivals the greater American baseball pitches. On three sides of the field of play there are tall covered stands, and on the fourth side the ground has been so well banked up with thousands of loads of cinders that a complete view of the game can be had from any portion.

The spectators are divided from the playing piece by a neat, low hoarding, and the touch line is far enough from it to prevent those accidents which were predicted at Anfield Road, but never happened... Taking it all together, it appears to be one of the finest and most complete grounds in the kingdom, and it is hoped that the public will liberally support the promoters.

The Mere Green field was owned by Christopher Leyland and Everton rented it until they were in a position to buy it outright. It was not without problems and parts of the site had to be excavated, the field was levelled, a drainage system was installed and turf was laid. This work was considered to be a 'formidable initial expenditure' and a local contractor Mr Barton was contracted to work on the {{convert|29471|sqyd|m2|lk=in|sigfig=2}} site at 4<U+00BD>d per square yard <U+2014> a total cost of <U+00A3>552.

[[Walton, Merseyside|Walton]] based building firm Kelly brothers were instructed to erect two uncovered stands that could each accommodate 4,000 spectators. A third covered stand accommodating 3,000 spectators was also requested. The combined cost of these stands was <U+00A3>1,640 and Everton had inserted a penalty clause into the contract for if the building work were to miss its 31 July deadline.<ref name="School of Science"/> Everton officials were impressed with the builder's workmanship and agreed two further contracts; exterior hoardings were constructed at a cost of <U+00A3>150 and 12 [[turnstile|turnstiles]] were installed at a cost of <U+00A3>7 each.<ref name="School of Science"/> In 1894, Benjamin Kelly of Kelly Brothers was appointed as a director of Everton.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evertoncollection.org.uk/exhibitions/the+anfield+split+%252d+the+move+to+goodison?p=5#foot|title=The Move to Goodison|publisher=Everton Collection|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>

[[James Clement Baxter|Dr. James Baxter]] of the Everton committee donated a <U+00A3>1,000 [[interest]]-free [[loan]] for the building of Goodison Park. The stadium was England's first purpose-built football ground, with stands on three sides. Goodison Park was officially opened on the 24th August 1892 by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the Football Association. No football was played. Instead the 12,000 crowd watched a short [[track and field athletics|athletics]] meeting followed by music and a fireworks display.<ref name="School of Science"/> Upon its completion the stadium was the first purpose built football stadium in England, and was only preceded in the United Kingdom by the Scottish club {{fc|Rangers}}' [[Ibrox Stadium]], inaugurated in 1887. [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic's]] [[Parkhead]] ground was inaugurated on the same day as Goodison. <ref name="tw-gp-history" />

The first match at Goodison Park was on 2 September 1892 between Everton and {{fc|Bolton Wanderers}}, Everton wearing new club colours of salmon and dark blue stripes. Everton won the game 4<U+2013>2.<ref name="tw-gp-history">{{cite web|url= http://www.toffeeweb.com/club/goodison/gp-history.asp|title=History of Goodison Park|publisher=ToffeeWeb.com|accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref> The first [[Football League|league]] game at Goodison Park took place on 3 September 1892 against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. The game ended in a 2<U+2013>2 draw, the stadium's first competitive goal was scored by Forest<U+2019>s Horace Pike, with the first Everton goal coming from [[Fred Geary]]. Everton's first league victory at their new ground came in the next home game with a 6<U+2013>0 defeat of [[Manchester United F.C.|Newton Heath]].

It was announced at a general meeting on 22 March 1895 that the club could finally afford to buy Goodison Park. Mahon revealed that Everton were buying Goodison Park for <U+00A3>650 less than Anfield was offered to them three years previously and Goodison Park had more land and had 25% larger capacity. The motion to purchase Goodison Park was passed unanimously.<ref name="iykyh" /> Dr. Baxter also lent the club <U+00A3>5,000 to pay the [[mortgage]] early at a rate of 3<U+00BD>%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evertoncollection.org.uk/object?id=796+EFC%2f1%2f1%2f3&p=320&q=%C2%A35%2c000|title=Minute book|publisher=evertoncollection.org.u|accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref> By this time the redrawing of political boundaries meant that Walton, and hence Goodison Park, were within the City of Liverpool.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolinpictures.com/History_of_Liverpool.htm|title=History of Liverpool|publisher=Liverpool in Pictures|accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref> 

''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper journalist [[David Conn]] unexpectedly coined the nickname "The Grand Old Lady" for the stadium in 1999 when he wrote "Another potential suitor has apparently thought better of Everton, walking away on Tuesday from the sagging Grand Old Lady of English football, leaving her still in desperate need of a makeover."<ref>{{cite book|last=Conn|first=David|title=Goodison Conundrum|publisher=The Independent|date=4 November 1999}}</ref>

[[Image:goodison-park-goodison-road-1905.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Goodison Road c.1905]]

Behind the goal, at the South end of the ground, the Goodison Avenue Stand was built in 1906. It was designed by Liverpool architect Henry Hartley<ref name="GoodisonInDepth" /> who went on to Chair the [[Liverpool Architectural Society]] a year later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolarchitecture.com/past_presidents.php|title=Past Presidents|publisher=The Liverpool Architectural Society|accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref> The club minutes from the time show that Hartley was unhappy with certain aspects of he stand and the poor [[sightline]]s meant that the goal line had to be moved 7 metres North, towards Gwladys Street. In January 1908, he complained that his fees had not been paid and the bill for the stand was near <U+00A3>13,000.<ref name="School of Science"/> There were 2,657 seats on its upper tier with a terrace below.

The Goodison Road Stand was constructed in 1909. In September that year Ernest Edwards, the [[Liverpool Echo]] journalist who christened the terrace at [[Anfield]] the "[[Spion Kop (stadia)|Spion Kop]]", wrote of the newly built stand, "The building as one looks at it, suggests the side of Mauretania at once".<ref>{{cite journal|date=September 1909|journal=Liverpool Echo}}</ref> The stand was occasionally referred to as the "Mauretania Stand", in reference to the Liverpool registered [[RMS Mauretania (1906)|RMS ''Mauretania'']], then the world's largest ship, which had recently docked in the [[Port of Liverpool]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocean-liners.com/ships/mauretania.asp|title=RMS Mauretania|publisher=Ocean-liners.com|accessdate=5 January 2010}}</ref>

The two-tier [[steel]] frame and wooden floor Bullens Road Stand, designed by [[Archibald Leitch]], was completed in 1926. The upper tier was seated, with terracing below, a part of the ground called The Paddock. The original Bullens Road Stand was replaced by a new one in 1895 with the open Goodison Road side covered, giving cover on all four sides of the ground. Few changes were made until 1963 when the rear of the Paddock was seated and an overhanging roof was added. The stand is known for Archibald Leitch's highly distinctive balcony [[truss]]es which also act as handrails for the front row of seats in the Upper Bullens stand. Goodison Park is the only stadium with two complete trusses designed by Leitch. Of the 17 created, only Goodison Park, [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] and [[Fratton Park]] retain these trusses.<ref name="Inglis" />

Everton constructed covered [[Technical area|dugouts]] in 1931. The idea was inspired by a visit to [[Pittodrie]] to play a friendly against [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]], where such dugouts had been constructed at the behest of the Dons' trainer Donald Coleman. The Goodison Park dugouts were the first in England.<ref name=GPrecords />

[[Image:gwladys-street-bombing.jpg|thumb|300px|Goodison Park was bombed in September 1940]]
The ground become an entirely two-tiered affair in 1938 when the Gwladys Street Stand was completed at a cost of <U+00A3>50,000.<ref name="GoodisonInDepth" /><ref name=GPrecords>{{cite web|url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/club/goodison/gp-records.asp|title=Goodison Park records|publisher=ToffeeWeb|accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref> Architect Leitch and Eveton Chairman [[Will Cuff]] became so close over the years that Cuff was appointed as Leitch's accountant and Leitch moved to nearby [[Formby]].<ref name="Inglis" />

In 1940, during the [[Second World War]], the Gwladys Street Stand suffered bomb damage. The bomb had landed directly in Gwladys Street and caused serious injury to nearby residents. The bomb splinter damage to the bricks on the stand is still noticeable. The cost of repair was <U+00A3>5,000 and was paid for by the [[War Damage Commission]].<ref name="GoodisonInDepth" />

The Director's minutes read: "It was decided also that Messrs A. Leitch be instructed to value the cost of complete renewal of damaged properties and that a claim should be forwarded to the War Damage Claims department within the prescribed 30 days.

"The damage referred to included the demolition of a wide section of the new stand outer wall in Gwladys St, destruction of all glass in this stand, damage to every door, canteen, water and electricity pipe and all lead fittings: perforate roof in hundreds of places.

"On Bullens Road side, a bomb dropped in the school yard had badly damaged the exterior wall of this stand and the roof was badly perforated here also. A third bomb outside the practice ground had demolished the surrounding hoarding and had badly damaged glass in the Goodison Ave and Walton Lane property."<ref>{{cite book|title=Everton Board Minutes|publisher=Everton Football Club|date=21 September 1941}}</ref>

The first [[undersoil heating]] system in English football was installed at Goodison Park in 1958, with 20 miles of electric wire laid beneath the playing surface at a cost of <U+00A3>16,000. The system was more effective than anticipated and the drainage system could not cope with the quantity of water produced from the melting of frost and snow. As a consequence the pitch had to be relaid in 1960 to allow a more suitable drainage system to be installed.<ref name="GoodisonInDepth" />

The Everton chairman [[John Moores (merchant)|Sir John Moores]] who presided over the club between 1960 and 1973 provided finances for the club in the form of loans to become involved in large-scale redevelopment projects and compete with other clubs for the best players, for a period of time under his stewardship Everton were known as 'The Mersey Millionaires'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0400evertonfc/merseymemories/tm_headline=when-everton-were-mersey-millionaires&method=full&objectid=14573264&siteid=50061-name_page.html|title=When Everton were Mersey millionaires|last=Redmond|first=Phil|date=26 August 2004|publisher=icliverpool|accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref>

Goodison Park featured in the filming of [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0150747/ The Golden Vision], a [[BBC]] film made for television. The matches featured in the film were Division One games against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 4 November 1967 (1<U+2013>1 draw) and 18 November 1967 versus [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] (1<U+2013>0 win) <U+2014> the scorer of the winner that day was [[Alex Young (footballer born 1937)|Alex Young]], also known as The Golden Vision or Golden Ghost after whom the film was named.

A scoreboard was first introduced on 20 November 1971. Everton beat [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] 8<U+2013>0 with [[Joe Royle]] scoring four, David Johnson three and [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]] one. The scoreboard did not have enough room to display the goal scorer's names and simply read "7 9 7 9 8 9 9 7" as it displayed the goal scorers' shirt numbers instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsno.co.uk/201p-100-Great-Everton-moments.html|title=100 Great Everton moments|publisher=NSNO|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>

The Goodison Road Main Stand was partially demolished and rebuilt during the 1969<U+2013>70 season with striking images of both old and new stands side by side. The new Main Stand opened 1971, at a cost of <U+00A3>1 million. The new stand housed the 500 and 300 members clubs<ref name="School of Science" /> and an [[escalator]] to the tallest stand in the ground <U+2014> the Top Balcony.<ref name="Inglis"/> However, not everyone thought that the upgrade was necessary at the time. Journalist [[Geoffrey Green]] of <i>The Times</i> wrote "Goodison Park has always been a handsome fashionable stage for football, a living thing full of atmospherics-like a theatre. And now it has stepped into the demanding seventies with a facelift it scarcely seemed to need compared with some of us I know. New giant stands in place of the old; the latest in dazzling floodlight systems that cast not a shadow.

===Post-Taylor Report===
Following the publication of the 1990 [[Taylor Report]], in the wake of the [[Hillsborough disaster]], top-flight English football grounds had to become all-seated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/sociology/css/resources/factsheets/fs2.html|title=Fact Sheet 2: Football Stadia After Taylor|publisher=[[University of Leicester]]: Department of Sociology|date=March 2002|accessdate=6 January 2010}}</ref> At the time three of the four sides of the ground had standing areas. The Enclosure, fronting the main stand, had already been made all-seated in time for the 1987<U+2013>88 season and was given the new name of Family Enclosure. The Paddock, the Park End terrace and the Gwladys Street terrace, known as 'the Ground', were standing and had to be replaced.  The Everton match versus Luton Town in May 1991 was the final time that Gwladys Street allowed standing spectators, 'crash barriers' (a blockade to prevent fans running onto the pitch) were also removed from the front of the stand.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Ken|title=Goodison Glory|publisher=Breedon Sports|pages=222|isbn=1873626118|accessdate=8 April 2010}}</ref> Seats were installed in the Paddock, while the Lower Gwladys Street was later completely rebuilt to accommodate seating with new concrete steps. 

Everton opted to demolish the entire Park End stand in 1994 and replace it with a single-tier [[cantilever]] stand, with the assistance of a grant of <U+00A3>1.3 million from the [[Football Trust]].<ref name="GoodisonInDepth"/>

[[Image:goodison-park.svg|300px|right|300px|thumb|[[Exploded view drawing|Exploded view]] plan of the present-day layout of Goodison Park]]
Goodison Park has a total capacity of 40,157 all-seated and comprises four separate stands: the Main Stand, Gwladys Street Stand, Bullens Road, and the Stanley Park End.<ref name="efc-poe">{{cite web|url=http://inquiry.knowsley.gov.uk/Proof%20of%20Evidence/TEV_P8.pdf|title=Proof of Evidence of Robert Elstone <U+2013> Everton Football Club Company Limited|last=Elstone|first=Robert|date=October 2008|publisher=Everton Football Club|accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref>

===Main Stand===
The Main Stand is a triple-decker stand with each deck-level given a seperate name. The middle-deck level is also known as the Main Stand section and is fronted by another seated section known as the Family Enclosure. The Enclosure was originally terracing prior to the advent of all-seater stadia. The Top Balcony is the highest part of the stadium. The stand became all seated in 1987 and now has a capacity of 12,664.<ref name="efc-poe" />

The Main Stand is also home to the conference and hospitality facilities. On non-match days Goodison Park holds conferences, weddings, meetings and parties on a daily basis.

===Bullens Road===
[[Image:Bullens Road.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Bullens Road|Bullens Road]]
On the East side of the ground, the Bullens Road stand is divided into the Upper Bullens, Lower Bullens and The Paddock. The rear of the south end of the stand houses away supporters. The north corner of the stand is connected to the Gwladys Street Stand. The current capacity of the stand is 10,784.<ref name="efc-poe" /> The stand takes its name from the adjacent Bullens Road. The Upper Bullens is decorated with Archibald Leitch's distinctive [[truss]] design.<ref>{{cite book|last=Inglis|first=Simon|title=Engineering Archive|isbn=978-1850749189}}</ref>

===Gwladys Street Stand===
Behind the goal at the North end of Goodison Park, the Gwladys Street Stand is divided into Upper Gwladys and Lower Gwladys. This stand is the "Popular End", holding the most boisterous and vociferous home supporters. It is known colloquially as "The Street End". If Everton win the toss before kick-off the captain traditionally elects to play towards the Gwladys Street End in the second half. The stand has a capacity of 10,788<ref name="efc-poe" /> and gives its name to [[Gwladys Street<U+2019>s Hall of Fame]].

===The Park End===
[[Image:Dixie Dean Monument.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Dixie Dean Statue, outside the Park End]]
At the south end of the ground, behind one goal, the Park Stand backs onto Walton Lane which borders [[Stanley Park, Liverpool|Stanley Park]]. The name of the stand was originally the ''Stanley Park End'' but it's commonly referred to as the ''Park End''. The single tiered stand broke from the multi-tiered tradition of Goodison Park. The Park End has the smallest capacity at Goodison Park. The current layout of the stand was opened on 17 September 1994 with a capacity of 5,922.<ref name="efc-poe" /> It was opened by [[David Hunt, Baron Hunt of Wirral|David Hunt]], a Member of Parliament.<ref name="GoodisonInDepth" /> During the structure's development, fans were able to watch matches by climbing trees in neighbouring Stanley Park. <ref>{{cite news|title=Bad weather gathering over Goodison Park |last=Shaw|first=Paul|date=25 April 1994|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=11 April 2010}}</ref>

In the late 1970s and 1980s the stand accommodated the away fans. Previously it was open to home supporters. The lower tier of the old stand was terracing and this was closed off by the turn of the 1980s due to it being a fire hazard as the terracing steps were wooden. The front concrete terracing remained and was one of the last standing areas at a Premiership ground.
During the 1960s and 1970s, both ends of the ground featured a large semicircle behind the goals. 

The area around Goodison Park when built was a dense area full of terraced housing, and Goodison Avenue behind the Park End stand was no different. Oddly housing was built right in to the stand itself (as shown on old photographs of Goodison and in programmes). The club had previously owned many of the houses on the road and rented them to players. One of the players to live there, [[Dixie Dean]] later had a statue erected in his honour near the Park End on Walton Lane.<ref name="School of Science" />
By the 1990s the club had demolished virtually the whole street and this coincided with the redevelopment of the Park End stand. However at present the majority of the land is now an open car park for the club and its [[Tent#Marquees and larger tents|Marquee]].

===St Luke's Church===

[[Image:Goodison-park-everton-hearts-1892.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=A wooden church structure can be seen behind the corner of the pitch.|Sketch published by ''Outdoors Magazine'' in 1892, St. Luke's predecessor <U+2013> a wooden church structure can be seen behind the corner of the pitch.]]

[[Image:St Lukes - Goodison.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=St. Lukes Church|St. Lukes Church now obscured by a jumbotron]]
{{details|St Luke's Church, Walton}}

Goodison Park is unique in the sense that a church, St Luke's, protrudes into the site between the Main Stand and the Gwladys Street Stand. Everton do not play early kick-offs on Sundays in order to permit Sunday services at the church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/1791575.stm|title=Everton obey holy orders|date=February 2002|publisher=BBC|accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref> The church is synonymous with the football club and a wooden church structure was in place when Goodison Park was originally built. Former Everton players such as [[Brian Harris (footballer)|Brian Harris]] have had their funeral service held there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/brian-harris-funloving-everton-footballer-784894.html|title=Brian Harris: Fun-loving Everton footballer|date=21 February 2008|publisher=Independent |accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref>

The church can be seen from the Park End and Bullens Road and has featured prominently over the years as a backdrop during live televised matches. It is also the home to the [[Everton Former Players' Foundation]] of which the Reverend is a trustee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/club/efpf-patrons-and-trustees.html|title=Patrons and Trustees|publisher=evertonfc.com|accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref>

Everton once tried to pay for its removal in order to gain extra space for a larger capacity.<ref name="GoodisonInDepth" />
In more recent years, a large 'jumbrotron' screen has been installed between the Main Stand and Gwladys Street partially obscuring the church from view. Before the all-seating regulations were introduced some fans would climb up and watch a football game from the church rooftop.

==The future==
[[File:redeveloped-goodison-park.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Artist's impression of a redevelopment of Goodison Park.]]
{{details|Everton Kirkby Project}}
Since the late [[1990s]] the board of Everton have been seeking a new, alternative stadium to replace Goodison Park. Plans for a possible relocation were first mentioned in 1996, when then chairman [[Peter Johnson (businessman)|Peter Johnson]] announced his intention to build a new 60,000-seat stadium for the club. At the time, no English league club had a stadium with such a high capacity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/season/96-97/reports/chelse_h.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080621073332/http://www.toffeeweb.com/season/96-97/reports/chelse_h.htm |archivedate=21 June 2008|title=Match Report: Everton v Chelsea 1996<U+2013>97 |accessdate=28 March 2010 }}</ref>

In 2001, plans were drawn up to move to a 55,000-seat purpose-built arena on the site of the [[King's Dock, Port of Liverpool|Kings Dock]] in Liverpool, but the plans never came to fruition as the club could not raise sufficient funds.<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/e/everton/2940481.stm|title=Everton fail in King's Dock bid|publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 April 2003|accessdate=17 December 2009}}</ref> Following this, plans were made to move to [[Kirkby]], just outside the city, in a joint venture with the supermarket chain [[Tesco]]. The scheme was greatly divisive amongst supporters and local authorities, but was rejected in late November 2009 following a decision by [[Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government]].

The site of Goodison Park was earmarked in 2003 for a food store by Tesco, who offered <U+00A3>12 million for the site valued at <U+00A3>4m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpool.gov.uk/Images/tcm21-62269.pdf|title=District and local centre study|publisher=Liverpool City Council|accessdate=16 December 2009}}</ref> The club were advised that the [[planning permission]] required would not necessarily be granted, and chose not to take the scheme further.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ellesmereportpioneer.co.uk/ellesmere-port-news/local-ellesmere-port-news/2002/11/01/new-kings-dock-hitch-for-blues-55940-12329338/|title=New Kings Dock Hitch For Blues|date=1 November 2002|publisher=Trinity Mirror|accessdate=16 December 2009}}</ref>

Supporters' groups have fought against the club moving to a new stadium twice. In 1996 a group called ''Goodison For Ever-ton'' successfully fought against the club moving to a new stadium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/club/kings-dock/new-stadium.asp|title=New Stadium|publisher=Toffeeweb.com|accessdate=7 April 2010}}</ref> In 2007 another group was established called ''Keep Everton In Our City'' (KEIOC) who attempted to prevent the club moving to a new stadium in [[Kirkby]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonbanter.co.uk/2008/11/new-everton-stadium-battle-lin.html|title=New Everton stadium battle lines drawn|date=18 November 2008|publisher=evertonbanter.co.uk (Trinity Mirror)|accessdate=7 April 2010}}</ref> The supporters' groups have argued that it is possible to expand Goodison Park, despite it being surrounded by housing and local authority buildings, and have produced image renders, architectural drawings and costings for a redeveloped Goodison Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/columnists/brian-reade/Why-Everton-dodged-a-bullet-over-Kirkby-stadium-and-some-advice-for-Tottenham-fans-and-Phil-Brown-article234691.html|title=Why Everton dodged a bullet over Kirkby stadium|last=Reade|first=Brian|date=27 November 2009|publisher=Mirror Football|accessdate=17 December 2009}}</ref> [[Liverpool City Council]] leader Warren Bradley stated that a redevelopment of Goodison Park was his favoured option, and that relocation of the homes, infrastructure and businesses in streets adjoining the ground is "not a major hurdle".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2009/11/27/kirkby-refusal-for-everton-forces-ground-share-re-think-92534-25264815/2/|title= Kirkby refusal for Everton forces ground share re-think|last=Bartlett|first=David|date=27 November 2009|publisher=Liverpool Daily Post|accessdate=17 December 2009}}</ref>

Everton's current position regarding the future of Goodison Park is that they are considering all options, including relocation, redevelopment of the current ground, or a [[groundshare]] with Liverpool F.C., in a new, purpose-built stadium in Stanley Park, stressing that finance is the main factor affecting decision-making.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/elstone-on-no-decision.html|title=Elstone on 'no' decision|date=26 November 2009|publisher=EvertonFC.com|accessdate=17 December 2009}}</ref>

In 2010 Everton supporters approached [[University of Liverpool]] and [[Liverpool City Council]] to initiate a dedicated 'Football Quarter'/'Sports City' zone around Goodison Park, [[Stanley Park, Liverpool|Stanley Park]] and [[Anfield]]. The University and City Council met with the [[North West Development Agency]], Everton and [[Liverpool F.C.]] representatives but no further action has been taken.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2010/03/13/liverpool-fc-and-everton-fc-fans-unite-to-promote-football-quarter-100252-26023078/|title=Liverpool FC and Everton FC fans' groups unite to promote city football quarter|last=Randles |first=David|date=13 March 2010|publisher=Liverpool Daily Post|accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref>

==Transportation==
Goodison Park is located two miles north of Liverpool City Centre. [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station]] is the nearest mainline station. The nearest station to the stadium is [[Kirkdale railway station]] on the [[Merseyrail]] [[Northern Line (Merseyrail)|Northern Line]] which is located just over half a mile away. On match days there is also a frequent shuttle bus service from [[Sandhills railway station]] known as "SoccerBus". In 2007 Sandhills underwent a <U+00A3>6million renovation to help encourage people to use the rail service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2007/11/09/sandhill-station-shuts-for-4-months-100252-20083337/|title=Sandhill Station shuts for 4 months|date=9 Novemer 2007|publisher=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref>

[[Walton and Anfield railway station]] located on [[A580 road|Walton Lane]] <U+2014> the same road that the Park End backs onto <U+2014> was the nearest station to Goodison Park until its closure in 1948.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/stations/w/walton_and_anfield/index.shtml|title=Walton and Anfield railway station|publisher=subbrit.org.uk|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> It is possible that the station could be re-opened should the [[Canada Dock Branch]] line be re-opened to the public following the construction of [[Stanley Park railway station]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inquiry.knowsley.gov.uk/Proof%20of%20Evidence/KEIOC-INQ-13.pdf|title=Merseytravel|date=10 December 2008|publisher=Merseytravel|accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref>

==Records==
Everton has staged more top-flight football games than any other club in England with Aston Villa having the second highest figure with eight less. Everton have played at Goodison Park for all but 4 of their 106 league seasons therefore Goodison Park has hosted more top-flight games than any other in England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engalltime.html|title=England <U+2013> First Level All-Time Tables 1888/89-2008/09|publisher=rsssf.com|accessdate=8 April 2010}}</ref> Goodison is the only English club ground to have hosted a [[FIFA World Cup]] semi final.

Everton won 15 home league games in a row between 4 October 1930 and 4 April 1931.<ref name="statto-records">{{cite web|url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/everton/records|title=Everton records|publisher=Statto.com|accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref> In the 1931<U+2013>32 season Goodison Park was the venue of the most goals scored at home in a league season, 84 by Everton.<ref name="efc-trivia" /> Between 23 April 1984 and 2 September 1986 Everton scored consecutively in 47 games.<ref name="statto-records" />

Between 23 April 1984 and 2 September 1986 Everton scored in 47 consecutive games at Goodison Park registering 36 wins and 7 draws, scoring 123 goals in the process while conceding 38. Scottish striker [[Graeme Sharp]] scored 32 of these goals.<ref name="efc-trivia" /> Until the expansion of [[Old Trafford]] in 1996 Goodison Park held the record Sunday attendance on a Football League ground (53,509 v West Bromwich Albion, FA Cup, 1974).

The most goals scored in a game at Goodison Park is 12, this has happened in two Everton games; versus Sheffield Wednesday (9<U+2013>3) on 17 October 1931 and versus Plymouth Argyle (8<U+2013>4) on 27 February 1954.<ref name="statto-records" />

==Attendances==
{{Main|List of average attendances at Goodison Park}}

Whilst at Goodison Park the club has had one of the highest average attendances in the country.

===Goodison Park as host stadium for football===
Goodison Park became the first Football League ground to hold an [[FA Cup Final]], in [[1894 FA Cup Final|1894]]. [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] beat Bolton Wanderers, watched by crowd of 37,000. An FA Cup final replay was staged in [[1910 FA Cup Final|1910]] with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] beating [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] 2<U+2013>0.

On 26 December 1920, Goodison Park hosted a match between; [[Dick, Kerr's Ladies]] & St Helens Ladies. An estimated 53,000 attended the match,<ref name="bbc-womens-football">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/women/4603149.stm|title=Trail-blazers who pioneered women's football |date=3 June 2005|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref> at a time when the average gate at Goodison Park in 1919<U+2013>20 was near 29,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonresults.com/ataglance5.htm|title=Everton Results|publisher=evertonresults.com|accessdate=11 April 2010}}</ref> Dick, Kerr's Ladies won 4<U+2013>0. More than <U+00A3>3,000 was raised for charity. Shortly after, the Football Association banned women's football. The reasons given by the F.A. were not substantial and it is perceived by some that the women's teams were a threat to the men's game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dickkerrladies.com/page7.htm|title=Dick, Kerr Ladies FC 1917<U+2013>1965|publisher=dickkerrladies.com|accessdate=6 April 2010}}</ref> The ban was lifted in 1970.<ref name="bbc-womens-football"/>

During the war, Goodison Park was chosen as a host venue for the "Football League <U+2013> Northern Section" and frequently hosted [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] drill sessions.<ref name="GoodisonInDepth" />

In 1949, Goodison Park became the site of [[England national football team|England]]'s first ever defeat on English soil by a non-Home Nations country, namely the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]. The ground hosted five matches including a semi-final for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]]. In April 1895 Goodison Park hosted England versus Scotland<ref name="1895-england-scotland" /> and so Everton became the first club to host England internationals on two grounds (the other being Anfield in 1889 when England won 6<U+2013>2 versus Ireland<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfc.com/MatchData/showmatchdetails.php?mid=38|title=EnglandFC Match Data|publisher=England FC|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>). The city of Liverpool also became the first English city to stage England games at three different venues, the other being [[Liverpool Cricket Club|Aigburth Cricket Club]].

In 1973 Goodison hosted [[Northern Ireland]]'s home games against Wales and England.<ref name="northern-ireland-host">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/jul/26/belfast-ormeau-park-football-stadium|title=Anger as Belfast stadium plan is revived|last=McDonald|first=Henry|date=26 July 2009 |publisher=Guardian|accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref>

====1966 FIFA World Cup====
{{Main|1966 FIFA World Cup}}

Goodison Park hosted five games during the 1966 FIFA World Cup. The original schedule of the 1966 World Cup meant that if England won their group and then reached the Semi final, the match would be held at Goodison Park. However, the organising committee were allowed to swap the venues, with England playing Portugal at [[Wembley Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagebluekipper.com/history/worldcupgood.htm|title= The World Cup At Goodison Park|publisher=bluekipper.com|accessdate=6 April 2010}}</ref>
