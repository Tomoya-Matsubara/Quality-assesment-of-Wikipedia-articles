'''Krohn Air AS''' is a [[virtual airline (economics)|virtual]], [[regional airline]] which flies from [[Molde Airport, <U+00C5>r<U+00F8>]] to [[Trondheim Airport, V<U+00E6>rnes]] in [[Norway]]. The airline has a [[British Aerospace Jetstream 32]], which is operated by [[Helitrans]].  The airline aims at the business segment, with early morning departures from Molde and four daily round trips.

The airline was established in 2010, after [[Scandinavian Airlines]] (SAS)  terminated its service between [[Molde]] and [[Trondheim]]. Originally services were provided using a [[Dornier Do 328]] operated by [[Sun Air of Scandinavia]]. Later in that year, Krohn Air acquired a Jetstream 32 and started flights from Molde to [[Bergen Airport, Flesland]] and [[Stavanger Airport, Sola]], but these services did not have sufficient patronage and were later terminated. By 2011, the airceaft operation was transferred to Helitrans.

==History==
From 31 January 2010, Scandinavian Airlines terminated its service from Molde to Trondheim. Krohn Air started operations 3 February 2010 on the same route, using a Dornier Do 328 [[wet leased]] from [[Sun Air of Scandinavia]]. The airline was established and fully owned by Claus Krohn, a local businessman, who was 76 years old at the time.<ref name=ny>{{cite news |url=http://www.adressa.no/nyheter/okonomi/article1438820.ece |title=Ny flyrute mellom Trondheim og Molde |work=[[Adresseavisen]] |last=Skj<U+00E6>rvik |first=Linda |date=31 January 2010 |accessdate=1 February 2010 |language=Norwegian  |accessdate=12 November 2010|archivedate=12 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uBllL6Em}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Krohn Air flyr Molde -Trondheim |work=[[Romsdals Budstikke]] |last=Heiene |first=Marit |date=31 January 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> SAS stated in 2011 that they did not regret closing the route, as with the size of aircraft they operated would need in excess of 20,000 passengers per year on the route, while Krohn Air could survive with less because they used smaller aircraft.<ref name=finansavisen>{{cite news |title=Har bitt seg fast i nisjerute |work=[[Finansavisen]] |last=Horntvedt |first=Anders |language=Norwegian |date=4 February 2011}}</ref>

On 28 June, the Scandinavian Airlines route from Molde to Bergen was taken over by [[Wider<U+00F8>e]]. However, while Scandinavian Airlines previously flew from Molde at 06:45, Wider<U+00F8>e's first flight departed at 08:55. Krohn Air stated that it saw this as a market opportunity to provide a business service from Molde to Bergen. Krohn Air had just bought a Jetstream 32 from Sun-Air, which it planned to use on a new route from [[Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget]] to Trondheim. However, after Wider<U+00F8>e stated that it would start that route in 2011, Krohn Air changed their plans and announced that the aircraft would instead be used on the route from Molde to Bergen.<ref name=utfordrer>{{cite news |url=http://www.rbnett.no/lokal/molde/article248072.ece |title=Krohn utfordrer Wider<U+00F8>e |last=Torvik |first=Egil H. |work=[[Romsdals Budstikke]]|date=15 July 2010 |accessdate=7 September 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=12 November 2010|archivedate=12 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uBlcG74z}}</ref> The Bergen service was started on 31 August.<ref name=tilbergen>{{cite news |url=http://www.rbnett.no/lokal/molde/article248072.ece |title=Krohn-<U+00E5>pning til Bergen |last=Torvik |first=Egil H. |work=[[Romsdals Budstikke]] |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=7 September 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=12 November 2010|archivedate=12 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uBla06sB}}</ref> On 7 September, the airline announced it would start services from Molde to Stavanger Airport, Sola on 13 August.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boarding.no/art.asp?id=43066 |title=Krohn Air starter Molde - Stavanger |work=[[Boarding.no]] |date=7 September 2010 |accessdate=15 October 2011 |language=Norwegian |archivedate=15 October 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62S8kM8hN}}</ref> Because there were few passengers, the services to Bergen and Stavanger were terminated from 19 November 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rbnett.no/lokal/molde/article281789.ece |title=Legg ned Bergensruta |last=Vingen |first=Anita |work=[[Romsdals Budstikke]] |date=12 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=12 November 2010|archivedate=12 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uBlUk5s5}}</ref>

Krohn Air bought both aircraft from Sun Air, but later decided that they would lease aircraft. The Dornier was sold back to Sun Air, whilst the Jetstream was sold to Helitrans, who took over operation of the route. However, there arose a disagreement between Krohn Air and Sun Air regarding the price of the Dornier, which is to be settled in court.<ref name=travelnews>{{cite news |url=http://www.travelnews.no/no/fly1/Krohn-Air-flyr-i-minus/ |title=Krohn Air flyr i minus |last=Igleb<U+00E6>k |first=Stein Arild |work=TravelNews |date=13 September 2011 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=15 October 2011 |archivedate=15 October 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62SA0T16d}}</ref> In 2010, the airline transported 14,000 people and had a revenue of 17 million [[Norwegian krone]], allowing Krohn Air to [[break-even (economics)|break even]].<ref name=finansavisen /> On 14 February 2011, the company increased the service from Molde to Trondheim from two to four daily services in each direction, from Monday through Thursday.<ref name=four>{{cite news |url=http://www.rbnett.no/lokal/molde/article303486.ece |title=Krohn Air utvider |last=Gilde |first=Renate |work=[[Romsdals Budstikke]] |date=27 January 2011 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=30 January 2011 |archivedate=30 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5w822d2vl}}</ref>
