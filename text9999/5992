The '''Oklahoma City bombing''' was a bomb attack on the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] in [[downtown Oklahoma City]] on April&nbsp;19, 1995. It was the most destructive act of terrorism on American soil until the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]].

Motivated by his hatred of the federal government and angered by what he perceived as its mishandling of the [[Waco Siege]] (1993) and the [[Ruby Ridge]] incident (1992), McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at Waco.<ref name="Sympathizers">{{cite news|last=Feldman|first=Paul|title=Militia Groups Growing, Study Says Extremism: Despite negative publicity since Oklahoma bombing, membership has risen, Anti-Defamation League finds|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/21526848.html?dids=21526848:21526848&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jun+18%2C+1995&author=PAUL+FELDMAN&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=Militia+Groups+Growing%2C+Study+Says+Extremism%3A+Despite+negative+publicity+since+Oklahoma+bombing%2C+membership+has+risen%2C+Anti-Defamation+League+finds.&pqatl=google|format=Fee required|date=June&nbsp;18, 1995|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=April&nbsp;7, 2010}}</ref><ref name="WacoRubyMcN">{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=McVeigh offers little remorse in letters|url=http://www.cjonline.com/stories/061001/new_mcveigh.shtml|date=June&nbsp;10, 2001|publisher=[[The Topeka Capital-Journal]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wovjJCKV|archivedate=February&nbsp;27, 2011}}</ref>

As with other large-scale terrorist attacks, conspiracy theories dispute the official claims and allege the involvement of additional perpetrators.

As a result of the bombing, the U.S. government passed [[United States federal building security|legislation designed to increase the protection around federal buildings]] to deter future terrorist attacks.

===Target selection===
[[File:Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building before destruction.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building as it appeared before its destruction]]
McVeigh initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing.<ref name="AmerTerror224">{{cite book|last=Michel|first=Lou|coauthors=Dan Herbeck|title=American Terrorist|page=224|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}</ref> McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law-enforcement agencies: the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF), the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), or the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law-enforcement agencies, such as the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] or the [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals Service]], as a bonus.<ref name="AmerTerror167">{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou|coauthor=Dan Herbeck|page=167|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}</ref>

McVeigh, a resident of [[Kingman, Arizona]], considered targets in Missouri, Arizona, Texas, and Arkansas.<ref name="AmerTerror167"/> McVeigh stated in his authorized biography that he wanted to minimize nongovernmental casualties, so he ruled out a 40-story government building in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], because of the presence of a florist's shop on the ground floor.<ref name="AmerTerror1689">{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou|coauthor=Dan Herbeck|pages=168<U+2013>169|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}</ref> In December&nbsp;1994, McVeigh and Fortier visited Oklahoma City to inspect their target: the Alfred P.

McVeigh rented a storage space, in which he stockpiled seven crates of 18-inch-long Tovex sausages, 80 spools of [[Shock tube detonator|shock tube]], and 500&nbsp;electric [[blasting cap]]s, which he and Nichols had stolen from a Martin Marietta Aggregates quarry in [[Marion, Kansas]].

Later, speaking about the military mindset with which he went about the preparations, he said, "You learn how to handle killing in the military. I face the consequences, but you learn to accept it."

===Building the bomb===
On April&nbsp;17&ndash;18, 1995, McVeigh and Nichols removed their supplies from their storage unit in [[Herington, Kansas]], where Nichols lived. They loaded 108 bags of high-grade [[ammonium nitrate]] [[fertilizer]] weighing {{convert|50|lb|kg}} each, three {{convert|55|U.S.gal|impgal l|adj=on}} drums of liquid [[nitromethane]], several crates of explosive [[Tovex]], seventeen bags of [[ANFO]], and spools of [[Shock tube detonator|shock tube]] and [[cannon fuse]] into a Ryder rental truck.<ref name="AmerTerror215">{{cite book|last=Michel|first=Lou |coauthors=Dan Herbeck|title=American Terrorist|page=215|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}</ref> The two then drove to Geary County State Lake, where they nailed boards onto the floor of the truck to hold the thirteen&nbsp;barrels in place and mixed the chemicals using plastic buckets and a bathroom scale.<ref name="AmerTerror216">{{cite book|last=Michel|first=Lou|coauthors=Dan Herbeck|title=American Terrorist|page=216|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}</ref> Each filled barrel weighed nearly {{convert|500|lb|kg}}.<ref name="AmerTerror2178">{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou|coauthor=Dan Herbeck|pages=217<U+2013>218|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}</ref> McVeigh added more explosives to the driver's side of the cargo bay, which he could ignite (killing himself in the process) at close range with his [[Glock 21]] pistol in case the primary fuses failed.<ref name="AmerTerror219">{{cite book|last=Michel|first=Lou|coauthors=Dan Herbeck|title=American Terrorist|page=219|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}</ref> During McVeigh's trial, Lori Fortier (the wife of Michael Fortier) stated that McVeigh claimed to have arranged the barrels in order to form a [[shaped charge]].<ref name="McVeighBomb33"/> This was achieved by [[wiktionary:tamp|tamping]] the aluminum side panel of the truck with bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer to direct the blast laterally towards the building.<ref name="web.mst.edu">{{cite web|title=Some Practical Applications of Forensic Seismology|last=Rogers|first=J.

McVeigh then added a dual-fuse ignition system accessible from the truck's front cab. He drilled two&nbsp;holes in the cab of the truck under the seat, while two&nbsp;holes were also drilled in the body of the truck. One&nbsp;green cannon fuse was run through each hole into the cab. These time-delayed fuses led from the cab of the truck, through plastic fish-tank tubing conduit, to two sets of non-electric blasting caps.<ref name="AmerTerror2178"/> The tubing was painted yellow to blend in with the [[truck]]'s [[livery]], and duct-taped in place to the wall to make them harder to disable by yanking from the outside.<ref name="AmerTerror2178"/> The fuses were set up to initiate, through shock tubes, the {{convert|350|lb|kg}} of Tovex Blastrite Gel "sausages", which would in turn set off the configuration of barrels.

==Arrests==
Initially, the FBI had three hypotheses regarding who might have been responsible for the bombing. The first was international terrorists, possibly the same group that had carried out the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing|World Trade Center bombing]] two years earlier. The FBI also thought that a [[drug cartel]] might have been carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents, as the building held a DEA office. The last hypothesis was that the bombing was done by [[Neo-fascism and religion#Christianity in the United States|Christian fascists]] acting on [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]].<ref name="Apocalypse623">{{cite book|title=Apocalypse in Oklahoma|last=Hamm|first=Mark S|pages=62<U+2013>63|isbn=1-55553-300-0}}</ref>

===Media coverage===
Hundreds of news trucks and members of the press arrived at the site to cover the story. The press immediately noticed that the bombing took place on the second anniversary of the [[Waco Siege|Waco incident]].<ref name="Jennings 1995-04-19"/> Many initial news stories, however, hypothesized the attack had been undertaken by Islamic terrorists, such as those who had masterminded the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]].<ref name="AmerTerror249">{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou|coauthor=Dan Herbeck|page=249|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}</ref><ref name="GuysGunsAmok102">{{cite book|title=Guys and Guns Amok|last=Kellner|first=Douglas|page=102|isbn=1-59451-493-3}}</ref><ref name="Apocalypse55">{{cite book|title=Apocalypse in Oklahoma|last=Hamm|first=Mark S|page=55|isbn=1-55553-300-0}}</ref> Some responded to these reports by attacking Muslims and people of Arab descent.<ref name="Unfinished140"/><ref name="AIs">{{cite journal|last=Progler|first=J.A|title=The Utility of Islamic Imagery in the West|journal=Al-Tawhid|volume=14|issue=4|url=http://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/islamicimageryinwest.htm|accessdate=June&nbsp;5, 2009}}</ref>

As the rescue effort wound down, the media interest shifted to the investigation, arrests, and trials of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, and on the search for an additional suspect named "John Doe Number Two".

===Timothy McVeigh===
{{Main|Timothy McVeigh}}
Opening arguments in McVeigh's trial began on April&nbsp;24, 1997. The [[Federal government of the United States|United States]] was represented by a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler. In his opening statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh's motivations, and the evidence against him. McVeigh, he said, had developed a hatred of the government during his time in the army, after reading ''[[The Turner Diaries]]''. His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia's ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the [[Brady Bill]], and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents.<ref name="Sympathizers"/> The prosecution called 137&nbsp;witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh's hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it.<ref name="Wright10">{{cite book|title=Patriots, Politics, and the Oklahoma City Bombing|last=Wright|first=Stuart|page=10|isbn=0-521-69419-1}}</ref> Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Michael revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date, and Lori testified that she created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck.<ref name="TMT">{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mcveigh/mcveighaccount.html|title=The Oklahoma City Bombing & The Trial of Timothy McVeigh|last=Linder|first=Douglas O.|year=2006|work=Famous Trials: Oklahoma City Bombing Trial|publisher=[[University of Missouri<U+2013>Kansas City]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wozOiWjC|archivedate=February&nbsp;27, 2011}}</ref>

McVeigh was represented by a defense counsel team of six principal attorneys led by Stephen Jones.<ref name="Petition">{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/threat/mcveigh/front.htm|title=Petition for Writ of Mandamus of Petitioner-Defendant, Timothy James McVeigh and Brief in Support|work=Case No. 96-CR-68-M|date=March&nbsp;25, 1997|publisher=[[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wozSLp4c|archivedate=February&nbsp;27, 2011}}</ref> According to law professor Douglas O. Linder, McVeigh wanted Jones to present a "necessity defense"<U+2014>which would argue that he was in "imminent danger" from the government (that his bombing was intended to prevent future crimes by the government, such as the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents).<ref name="TMT"/> McVeigh argued that "imminent" does not mean "immediate": "If a comet is hurtling toward the earth, and it's out past the orbit of Pluto, it's not an immediate threat to Earth, but it is an imminent threat."<ref name="AmerTerror2856">{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou|coauthor=Dan Herbeck|pages=285<U+2013>286|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}</ref> Despite McVeigh's wishes, Jones attempted to discredit the prosecution's case in an attempt to instill reasonable doubt. Jones also believed that McVeigh was part of a larger conspiracy, and sought to present him as "the designated patsy".<ref name="TMT"/> However McVeigh disagreed with Jones arguing that rationale for his defense. After a hearing, Judge Matsch independently ruled the evidence concerning a larger conspiracy to be too insubstantial to be admissible.<ref name="TMT"/> In addition to arguing that the bombing could not have been carried out by two men alone, Jones also attempted to create reasonable doubt by arguing that no one had seen McVeigh near the scene of the crime, and that the investigation into the bombing had lasted only two weeks.<ref name="TMT"/> Jones presented 25&nbsp;witnesses over a one-week period, including Dr. [[Frederic Whitehurst]]. Although Whitehurst described the FBI's sloppy investigation of the bombing site and its handling of other key evidence, he was unable to point to any direct evidence that he knew to be contaminated.<ref name="TMT"/>

A key point of contention in the case was the unmatched left leg found after the bombing. Although it was initially believed to be from a male, it was later determined to be that of Lakesha Levy, a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing.<ref name="LakeshaLeg">{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=David|title=Leg in the Oklahoma City Rubble Was That of a Black Woman|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/31/us/leg-in-the-oklahoma-city-rubble-was-that-of-a-black-woman.html|date=August&nbsp;31, 1995|work=The New York Times|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wozdqYws|archivedate=February&nbsp;27, 2011}}</ref> Levy's coffin had to be re-opened so that her leg could replace another unmatched leg that had previously been buried with her remains. The unmatched leg had been embalmed, which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine the leg's owner.<ref name="LeftLeg"/> Jones argued that the leg could have belonged to another bomber, possibly John Doe #2.<ref name="LeftLeg"/> The prosecution disputed the claim, saying that the leg could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg.<ref name="WritingEnd100">{{cite book|title=Writing at the End of the World|author=Miller, Richard Earl|page=100}}</ref>

Numerous damaging leaks, which appeared to originate from conversations between McVeigh and his defense attorneys, emerged. They included a confession said to have been inadvertently included on a computer disk that was given to the press, which McVeigh believed seriously compromised his chances of getting a fair trial.<ref name="TMT"/> A [[gag order]] was imposed during the trial, prohibiting attorneys on either side from commenting to the press on the evidence, proceedings, or opinions regarding the trial proceedings. The defense was allowed to enter into evidence six pages of a 517-page Justice Department report criticizing the FBI crime laboratory and David Williams, one of the agency's explosives experts, for reaching unscientific and biased conclusions. The report claimed that Williams had worked backward in the investigation rather than basing his determinations on forensic evidence.<ref name="AmerTerror3157">{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou|coauthor=Dan Herbeck|pages=315<U+2013>317|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}</ref>

===Michael Fortier===
{{Main|Michael and Lori Fortier}}
Michael and Lori Fortier were considered accomplices for their foreknowledge of the planning of the bombing.

===Others===
No "John Doe #2" was ever identified, nothing conclusive was ever reported regarding the owner of the unmatched leg, and the government never openly investigated anyone else in conjunction with the bombing. Although the defense teams in both McVeigh's and Nichols trials suggested that others were involved, Judge Steven W. Taylor found no credible, relevant, or legally admissible evidence, of anyone other than McVeigh and Nichols having directly participated in the bombing.<ref name="TMT"/> When McVeigh was asked if there were other conspirators in the bombing, he replied: "Because the truth is, I blew up the Murrah Building, and isn't it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell?"<ref name="NoSympathy">{{cite news|first=Thomas|last=Jo|title='No Sympathy' for Dead Children, McVeigh Says|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/29/us/no-sympathy-for-dead-children-mcveigh-says.html|work=The New York Times|date=March&nbsp;29, 2001|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGWwL6JH|archivedate=March&nbsp;17, 2011}}</ref> On the morning of McVeigh's execution a letter was released in which he had written "For those die-hard conspiracy theorists who will refuse to believe this, I turn the tables and say: Show me where I needed anyone else.

===Legislation===
In the wake of the bombing the U.S. government enacted several pieces of legislation, notably the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]].<ref name="AntiFAS">{{cite web|last=Doyle|first=Charles|title=Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996: A Summary|publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists|FAS]]|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/crs/96-499.htm|date=June&nbsp;3, 1996|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGXWAzia|archivedate=March&nbsp;17, 2011}}</ref> In response to the trials of the conspirators being moved out-of-state, the Victim Allocution Clarification Act of 1997 was signed on March&nbsp;20, 1997 by President Clinton to allow the victims of the bombing (and the victims of any other future acts of violence) the right to observe trials and to offer impact testimony in sentencing hearings.

The attack led to engineering improvements allowing buildings to better withstand tremendous forces, improvements which were incorporated into the design of Oklahoma City's new federal building.

===Discussion of the nature of dissent===
Even many who agreed with some of McVeigh's politics viewed his act as counterproductive, with much of the criticism focused on the deaths of innocent children; critics expressed chagrin that McVeigh had not assassinated specific government leaders. McVeigh had indeed contemplated the assassinations of Attorney General [[Janet Reno]], Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building,<ref name="FOXLetter"/> and after the bombing he said that he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead.<ref name="FOXAssassin">{{cite news|title=McVeigh Considered Assassination of Reno, Other Officials|date=April&nbsp;27, 2001|publisher=Fox News|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,17501,00.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGY3FIxG|archivedate=March&nbsp;17, 2011}}</ref> Those who expressed sympathy for McVeigh typically described his deed as an act of war, as in the case of [[Gore Vidal]]'s essay ''The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh''.<ref name="MeaningMcVeigh">{{cite news|last=Vidal|first=Gore|title=The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh|date=September&nbsp;2001|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2001/09/mcveigh200109|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGY5KeHI|archivedate=March&nbsp;17, 2011}}</ref><ref name="McVeighRevere">{{cite news|last=Gibbons|first=Fiachra|title=Vidal Praises Oklahoma Bomber for Heroic Aims|date=August&nbsp;17, 2001|publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]]|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/aug/17/edinburghbookfestival2001.mcveigh|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGY9Jsdm|archivedate=March&nbsp;17, 2011|location=London}}</ref> Other journalists compared him to [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]].<ref name="McVeighBrown">{{cite news|last=Finkelman|first=Paul|title=Analogies: Was Timothy McVeigh Our John Brown?|date=July&nbsp;6, 2001|publisher=[[History News Network]]|url=http://hnn.us/articles/139.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGYDpCAr|archivedate=March&nbsp;17, 2011}}</ref>

McVeigh believed that the bomb attack had a positive impact on government policy. In evidence he cited the peaceful resolution of the [[Montana Freemen]] standoff in 1996, the government's $3.1&nbsp;million settlement with [[Randy Weaver]] and his surviving children four months after the bombing, and April&nbsp;2000 statements by Bill Clinton regretting his decision to storm the Branch Davidian compound.

The memorial includes a reflecting pool flanked by two large gates, one inscribed with the time 9:01, the other with 9:03, the pool representing the moment of the blast. On the south end of the memorial is a field of symbolic bronze and stone chairs<U+2014>one for each person lost, arranged according to what floor of the building they were on. The chairs represent the empty chairs at the dinner tables of the victims' families. The seats of the children killed are smaller than those of the adults lost. On the opposite side is the "survivor tree", part of the building's original landscaping that survived the blast and fires that followed it. The memorial left part of the foundation of the building intact, allowing visitors to see the scale of the destruction. Part of the chain link fence put in place around the site of the blast, which had attracted over 800,000&nbsp;personal items of commemoration later collected by the Oklahoma City Memorial Foundation, is now on the western edge of the memorial.<ref>White, Zachary.
