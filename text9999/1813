The '''Rheinmetall {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} gun''' is a [[smoothbore]] [[tank gun]] designed and produced by the [[Germany|German]] [[Rheinmetall|Rheinmetall-DeTec AG]] company. It was developed in response to Soviet advances in armor technology and development of new armored threats.  With production beginning in 1974, the first version of the gun, known as the L/44, was used on the German [[Leopard 2]], and was soon exported to be used on tanks such as the [[United States|American]] [[M1 Abrams]] and the [[Israel]]i [[Merkava]] tanks.  It has also been exported to [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]], as well as nations which have procured the Leopard 2 and the M1 Abrams.  Rheinmetall's {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} L/44 tank gun has a length of {{convert|5.28|m|yd|sp=us}}, while the gun system weighs approximately {{convert|3317|kg|lb|sp=us}}.  However, by 1990 the L/44 was not considered powerful enough to deal with modernized Soviet armor, such as the [[T-80]]B, which stimulated an effort by Rheinmetall to develop a better main armament.  This first revolved around a {{convert|140|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} tank gun, but later turned into a compromise which led to the development of an advanced {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} gun.

This gun was the L/55, based on the same internal geometry as the L/44 and installed in the same breech and mount.  The L/55 is {{convert|1.3|m|yd|sp=us}} longer, allowing for an increase in muzzle velocity for ammunition being fired through it.  The fact that it retains the same barrel geometry allows the L/55 to fire the same ammunition as the L/44.  This gun was retrofitted into German and Dutch Leopard 2s, and chosen as the main gun of the Spanish [[Leopard 2E]] and Greek Leopard 2HEL.  The L/55 was chosen as the armament of the new South Korean K2 main battle tank, and has been tested on the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Challenger 2]], as a potential replacement to the existing {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} rifled gun.

A variety of ammunition has been developed for use by tanks armed with Rheinmetall's tank gun.  This includes a series of [[kinetic energy penetrators]], such as the American [[M829 (munition)|M829]] series, and [[High explosive anti-tank warhead|chemical energy anti-tank]] warheads.  Recent ammunition includes a wide range of new anti-personnel rounds and demolition munitions, giving tanks armed with Rheinmetall's tank gun greater versatility on the modern battlefield.  The [[LAHAT]], developed in Israel, is a gun-launched missile which has received interest from Germany and other Leopard 2 users, and is designed to defeat both enemy armor and enemy combat helicopters.  The Israelis also introduced a new anti-personnel munition, which limits collateral damage by controlling the fragmentation of the projectile when fired.

==Background==
[[image:Leo2Br80.jpg|thumb|left|Prototype of the [[Leopard 2]]]]
Worried about the ability of the existing [[NATO]] [[Royal Ordnance L7|L7 {{convert|105|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}}]] tank gun to penetrate new Soviet armor, Rheinmetall began development of a new tank gun in 1964.<ref name="Janes44">Jane's Armour & Artillery (subscription), [http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jaau/jaau0021.html Rheinmetall 120 mm L44 smoothbore gun (Germany)], accessed 6 November 2008</ref>  The first instance of a larger Soviet tank gun was witnessed on the chassis of a modified [[T-54/55|T-55]] in 1961.<ref>Norman, p. 14</ref>  In 1965, the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[T-62]] made its first public appearance, armed with a {{convert|115|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} [[smoothbore]] tank gun.<ref>Zaloga (1979), p. 20</ref>  The Soviet decision to increase the power of its tank's main armament had come when, in the early 1960s, an [[Iran]]ian tank commander defected over the Soviet border in a brand-new [[M60 Patton]] tank, which was armed with the British Royal Ordnance L7.<ref name="Zaloga045">Zaloga (2004), p. 5</ref>  Despite the introduction of the T-62, in 1969 their [[T-64]] tank was rearmed with a new {{convert|125|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} tank gun,<ref name="Zaloga045" /> while in 1972 [[Nizhny Tagil]] began production of the [[T-72]] tank, armed with the {{convert|125|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} tank gun as well.<ref>Zaloga (2004), p. 7</ref>   For example, at the fighting at Sultan Yakoub, during the [[1982 Lebanon War]], the [[Israel]]i government claimed to have destroyed 9 [[Syria]]n T-72s with the [[Merkava|Merkava II]] main battle tank, armed with an Israeli production version of the [[United States|American]] M68 {{convert|105|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} tank gun (which in turn was based on the British L7).<ref>Warford (2006), pp. 23<U+2013>24</ref>  Whether or not true, the Soviets test fired a number of Israeli M111 ''Hetz'' [[Kinetic energy penetrator|armor piercing discarding sabots]] at [[Kubinka]], finding the  {{convert|105|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} round was able to perforate the T-72's [[glacis]] plate, but not its turret armor.<ref>Warford (2006), p. 24</ref>  In response, the Soviets developed the T-72M1.<ref>Warford (2006), p. 25</ref>  This led Israel to opt for a {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} tank gun during the development process of the Merkava III main battle tank.<ref>Katz (1997), 38</ref>  This case is similar to the American decision to replace the M68 {{convert|105|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} tank gun with Rheinmetall's {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} gun in 1976; the introduction of the T-64A had caused uncertainty within the armor community as to whether or not the new ammunition designed for the existing gun caliber could effectively deal with the new Soviet tank threat.<ref>Green (2005), 32<U+2013>33</ref>

In 1963, Germany and the United States had already embarked on a joint<U+2013>tank program, known as the [[MBT-70]].  The new tank featured a three-man crew, with the driver in the turret, an automatic loader for the main gun, a {{convert|20|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} [[coaxial]] [[autocannon]], an active [[hydropneumatic suspension]] and spaced armor on the [[glacis]] plate and the front turret.<ref>Hilmes (2001), p. 17</ref>  The new tank concept also showcased an improved tank armament; this was a {{convert|152|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} missile-launching main gun, designed to fire the [[MGM-51 Shillelagh]] [[Anti-tank guided missile|anti-tank missile]].<ref>Zaloga (1982), p. 19</ref>  However, the [[Bundeswehr|German Army]] was interested in a tank gun which could fire conventional ammunition.  Although there were attempts to modify the {{convert|152|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} tank gun to do so, the process proved extremely difficult, and the Germans began development of the future Rheinmetall {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} tank gun instead.<ref>McNaugher (1981), p. vi</ref>

[[Image:M1-A1 Abrams Fire.jpg|thumb|250px|An [[M1 Abrams|M1A1 Abrams]], firing its Rheinmetall's {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} tank gun]]

In 1967, the German Ministry of Defense decided to re-open a Leopard 1 improvement program, known as the ''Vergoldeter Leopard'' (Gilded Leopard), later renamed the ''Keiler'' (Wild Boar).  [[Krauss-Maffei]] was chosen as the contractor, and two prototypes were developed in 1969 and 1970.<ref>Jerchel (1998), p. 5</ref>    This program grew into the [[Leopard 2]], and the first prototype of the new tank was delivered in 1972, equipped with a {{convert|105|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} smoothbore main gun.  Between 1972 and 1975 a total of 17 prototypes were developed.<ref>Hilmes (2001), p. 18</ref>  Simultaneously, the new {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} tank gun's ten year development effort, which had begun in 1964, ended in 1974.<ref name="Janes44" />  Ten of the 17 turrets built were equipped with the {{convert|105|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} smoothbore gun, while the other seven were equipped with the larger {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} tank gun.<ref>Jerchel (1998), p. 6</ref>  Another program aimed to mount the {{convert|152|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} missile-gun was also developed, in an attempt to save components from the MBT-70, but in 1971 the program was ended for economic reasons.<ref>Jerchel (1998), pp. 6<U+2013>7</ref>  Instead, the Germans opted for Rheinmetall's {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} L/44 smoothbore tank gun.<ref>Jerchel (1998), p. 7</ref>

==Design features==
With a [[caliber]] of {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us}}, and a [[Caliber#Caliber as measurement of length|caliber length]] of 44, Rheinmetall's L44 tank gun has a length of {{convert|5.28|m|yd|sp=us}}.<ref>Rheinmetall Defense, ''[http://www.rheinmetalldefence.com/index.php?fid=1448&lang=3&pdb=1 120 mm L44 Tank Gun]'', accessed 9 November 2008; barrel length can be found by multiplying the caliber length by the caliber diameter.</ref>  The gun's barrel weighs {{convert|1190|kg|lb|sp=us}},<ref name="Maxwell0282">Maxwell (2002), p. 82</ref> and on the [[M1 Abrams]] the gun mount weighs {{convert|3317|kg|lb|sp=us}}.<ref>Green (2005), p. 61</ref>, while the new barrel ('''L55''') is 55 calibers long, increasing the length by {{convert|1.30|m|yd|sp=us}}. 
The [[bore evacuator]] and the gun's thermal sleeve, designed to regulate the temperature of the barrel, are fabricated out of [[glass-reinforced plastic]], while the barrel has a chrome lining to increase barrel life.<ref name="Janes44" />  Originally, the tank gun had a barrel life of anywhere between 400<U+2013>500 rounds, but with recent advances in [[propellant]] technology the average barrel life has decreased to 260 rounds. In some cases, barrels have had to be replaced after only 50 fired projectiles.<ref>Burton (2004), pp. 51<U+2013>52</ref>  The gun's recoil mechanism is composed of two hydraulic retarders and a hydropneumatic assembly.<ref name="Janes44" />

Production of the German Leopard 2 and the new {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} tank gun began in 1979, fulfilling an order for the German Army.<ref>Jerchel (1998), p. 11</ref>  Although the American M1 Abrams was originally armed with a {{convert|105|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} main gun,<ref name="Green9256">Green (1992), p. 56</ref> the [[United States Army]] had planned to outfit the tank with a larger main gun at a later date;<ref>Chait (2005), p. 12</ref> therefore, the tank's turret had been designed to accept a larger {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} gun.<ref name="Green9256"/>  The larger gun was integrated into the M1A1 Abrams, with the first vehicle coming off the production line in 1985<ref>Green (2005), pp. 24<U+2013>29</ref>  The gun, known as the M256, was based on the L/44 tank gun, although manufactured at Watervliet Arsenal and modified to increase the resistance of the barrels to fracture and fatigue.<ref>Chait (2005), pp. 12<U+2013>13</ref>  In the 1980s, the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli Army]] began to develop the [[Merkava]] III main battle tank; this tank would introduce a new {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} tank gun, to replace the M68 {{convert|105|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} gun on the Merkava I and Merkava II.<ref>Katz (1997), pp. 38<U+2013>39</ref>  Originally planned to be a licensed production version of the American M256,<ref>Katz (1997), p. 38</ref> the gun was modified and manufactured in [[Israel]] as the MG251;<ref>Gelbart (2004), p. 35</ref> the Israeli gun retains the inner geometry of the barrel to allow commonality with German and American ammunition.<ref>Hilmes (2007), p. 88</ref>  A version of the gun is in production to arm the [[Sabra (tank)|Sabra]] modification of [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[M60 Patton]] tanks,<ref>Maxwell (2003), p. 15</ref> named the MG253.<ref>Hilmes (2004), p. 78</ref>  An improved version of the Israeli tank gun was introduced with the Merkava IV, giving the gun the ability to survive higher barrel pressures, which in turn allows increased muzzle velocity for kinetic energy penetrators.<ref>Gelbart (2004), p. 39</ref><ref>Eshel (2003), p. 45</ref>  Other tanks armed with licensed produced versions of Rheinmetall's gun include [[Japan]]'s [[Type 90]]<ref>Bolt<U+00E9> (1997), p. 25</ref> and [[South Korea]]'s [[K1 88-Tank|K1A1]].<ref>Clemens (1999), p. 15</ref>

===Rheinmetall L55 120mm===
The appearance of new Soviet tanks during the late 1970s and early 1980s, such as the T-80B, demanded the development of new technologies and weapons to counter the threat posed to Western armor.<ref>Jerchel (1998), p. 24</ref>  Apart from increased firepower,<ref>Baryatinskiy (2006), pp. 23<U+2013>25</ref> the T-80B was protected by a new [[Composite armour|composite ceramic armor]].<ref>Baryatinskiy (2006), p. 14</ref>  The [[T-72]] also went through a modernization program, in an attempt to bring it up to the standards of the T-80B.  In 1985, a new version entered production, known as the T-72B, showcasing a new laminate armor protection system.  The turret armor of the T-72B surpassed the T-80B's in protection, and was designed primarily to defeat anti-tank missiles.<ref>Zaloga (1993), p. 10</ref>

[[Image:Leopard 2A6 with new smoke dispenser.jpg|left|thumb|Two [[Leopard 2|Leopard 2A6]] of the [[German Army]] with L55]]

The German government began the development of the Leopard 3, although this was canceled after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Jerchel (1998), p. 33<U+2013>34</ref>  On 29 October 1991, the governments of Switzerland, Netherlands and Germany agreed to cooperate in the development of a modernization program for the Leopard 2.  Part of this program included the introduction of a longer {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} tank gun,<ref>Jerchel (1998), p. 34</ref> a cheaper alternative to a brand new tank gun,<ref name="Hilmes0476">Hilmes (2004), p. 76</ref> increasing the maximum range of the gun by an estimated {{convert|1500|m|yd|sp=us}}.  Although the gun is longer, allowing for a higher peak pressure from the propellant, the geometry remains the same, allowing the gun to fire the same ammunition as that fired from the shorter caliber version of the cannon.<ref name="Janes55">Jane's Armour & Artillery Upgrades (subscription), ''[http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jaau/jaau0020.html Rheinmetall 120 mm L55 smoothbore gun (Germany)]'', accessed 10 November 2008</ref>  The longer barrel allows ammunition to attain higher velocities; for example, with new kinetic energy penetrators ammunition can reach velocities of around {{convert|1750|m/s|ft/s|sp=us}}.<ref>Rheinmetall Defence, ''[http://www.rheinmetalldefence.com/index.php?fid=1449&lang=3&pdb=1 120 mm L55 Tank Gun], accessed 10 November 2008</ref>  The new barrel weighs {{convert|1347|kg|lb|sp=us}}.<ref name="Maxwell0282" />

The longer tank gun has been retrofitted into the Leopard 2, into a model known as the Leopard 2A6.<ref name="Hilmes0476" />  Both the Spanish [[Leopard 2E]] and the Greek Leopard 2HEL, as derivatives of the Leopard 2A6, use the 55 caliber long tank gun.<ref>Candil (2007), p. 66</ref>

==Ammunition==
[[Image:USARMY-M829A2.gif|thumb|The American [[M829 (munition)|M829]] armor piercing sabot]]

A variety of rounds have been developed for Rheinmetall's tank gun.  For example, a long line of armor piercing discarding sabots was developed by Rheinmetall.  Originally, the Leopard 2 was outfitted with the DM-23 kinetic energy penetrator,<ref name="Jerchel9822">Jerchel (1998), p. 22</ref> based on the Israeli M111 ''Hetz''.<ref>Jane's Ammunition Handbook (subscription), ''[http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jah/jah_0250.html 105 mm M111 IMI APFSDS-T round (Israel), Tank and anti-tank guns]'', accessed 11 November 2008</ref>  The DM23 was eventually replaced by the DM33, which was also adopted by Japan, Italy, Netherlands and Switzerland.  The DM43 is a further development of this round, co-developed between Germany and France.  The United States adopted the round and manufactured it as the M829.  The DM33 has a three-part aluminum [[sabot]] and a two-part [[tungsten]] penetrator, and is said to be able to penetrate {{convert|560|mm|in|sp=us}} of steel armor at a range of {{convert|2000|m|yd|sp=us}}.<ref name="JanesDM33">Jane's Ammunition Handbook (subscription), ''[http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jah/jah_0303.html 120 mm DM 33A1 and DM 43A1 APFSDS-T rounds (Germany)]'', accessed 11 November 2008</ref>  The introduction of the longer barrel came hand in hand with the introduction of a new kinetic energy penetrator, the [[DM53]].  With a muzzle velocity of between {{convert|1650|m/s|ft/s|sp=us}}<ref>Eshel (2005), pp. 96<U+2013>98</ref> and {{convert|1750|m/s|ft/s|sp=us}}, the projectile has an engagement range of up to {{convert|4000|m|yd|sp=us}}.<ref name=Eshel96>Eshel (2005), p. 96</ref>  A further development, called the DM63, improved upon the round by introducing a new temperature independent propellant, which allows the propellant to have a constant pattern of expansion between ambient temperatures (inside the gun barrel) of anywhere between {{convert|-47|C|F |sp=us}} and {{convert|+71|C|F|sp=us}}.  The new propellant powders, known as surface coated double base (SCDB) propellants, allow the DM63 to be used in a wide variety of climates without a negative impact on the projectile's performance.<ref>Hilmes (2007), p. 93</ref>  Apart from Germany, the new ammunition has been accepted into service with the Dutch and Swiss armies.<ref>Jane's Ammunition Handbook (subscription), ''[http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jah/jah_0304.html 120 mm DM53 and DM63 LKE II APFSDS-T round (Germany)]'', accessed 11 November 2008</ref>

The United States developed a number of kinetic energy penetrators, based on the [[M829 (munition)|M829]].<ref>Green (2005), p. 68</ref>  An immediate improvement, known as the M829A1, was dubbed the "Silver Bullet" after its combat performance, during the [[Gulf War]], against [[Iraq]]i [[T-54/55|T-55]]s, [[T-62]]s and T-72s.<ref>Green (1992), p. 74</ref>  The M829 series centers around the [[depleted uranium]] penetrator, designed to penetrate enemy armor through kinetic energy and to shatter inside the turret, thereby damaging as much as possible within the confinement of the tank.<ref>Green (1992), pp. 76<U+2013>77</ref>  In 1998, the United States military introduced the M829A2, which has an improved depleted uranium penetrator.<ref>Green (2005), p. 69</ref>  In 2002, production of the M829A3 began, which is said to be able to defeat the latest versions of Russian [[explosive reactive armor]].<ref>Green (2005), p. 70</ref> 

Both Germany and the United States have developed a number of other rounds.  These include the German DM12 multipurpose anti-tank projectile (MPAT), based on the technology in a [[high explosive anti-tank warhead]].<ref name="Jerchel9822" />  However, it's been found that the DM12's armor killing abilities are limited by the lack of blast and fragmentation effects, and that the round is less valuable against lightly armored targets.<ref>Eshel (2005), p. 98</ref>  The United States also has a MPAT type projectile, known as the [[M830]].<ref>Green (2005), p. 71</ref>  This was later developed into the M830A1 which allows the M1 Abrams to use the round against helicopters.<ref>Fogg (1994), p. 12</ref>  The M1 Abrams can make use of the M1028 canister round, which is an antipersonnel munition, packed with over 1,000 tungsten balls.<ref>Green (2005), p. 72</ref>  The United States Armed Forces accepted a new demolition round, called the M908 Obstacle Defeating Round, based on the M830A1 MPAT, but with the proximity fuse replaced by a hardened nose cap.  The cap allows the round to impact and embed itself in concrete, and therefore explodes inside the target and causes more damage.<ref>Hilmes (2007), pp. 92<U+2013>93</ref>

The Israeli Army introduced a new round, known as the Laser Homing Anti-Tank ([[LAHAT]]) projectile.<ref name=JanesIAI>Jane's Armour & Artillery Upgrades (subscription), ''[http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jaau/jaau9019.html Israel Aerospace Industries LAser Homing Anti-Tank (LAHAT) projectile (Israel), Gun-launched guided projectiles]'', accessed 13 November 2008</ref>  Using a semi-active laser homing guidance method, the LAHAT can be guided by the tank's crew or by teams on the ground, while the missile's trajectory can be chosen between top attack (to defeat enemy armor) and direct attack (to engage enemy helicopters).  Furthermore, the missile can be fired by both {{convert|105|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} and {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} tank guns.<ref>Gelbart (2004), pp. 40<U+2013>41</ref>  The LAHAT has been offered as an option for the Leopard 2, and has been marketed by both Israel Military Industries and Rheinmetall to Leopard 2 users.<ref>Eshel (2005), p. 100</ref>  Israeli Merkavas make use of a round known as the APAM, which is an anti-personnel munition designed to release fragmentation at controlled intervals to limit the extent of damage.  Fragments are shaped to have enough kinetic energy to penetrate enemy body armor.<ref>Eshel (2003), p. 46</ref>

Poland has also introduced a series of projectiles for Rheinmetall's tank gun, including an armor piercing penetrator target practice round (APFSDS-T-TP), a high explosive round and a high explosive target practice (HE-TP) projectile.  The ammunition is manufactured by ''Zaklady Produkcji Specjalnej Sp.''.<ref>Brumar, ''120 mm Rounds for Rh 120 L 44 Tank Gun''</ref>

Due to tank sales, Rheinmetall's L/44 tank gun has been manufactured for other nations.  For example, the Leopard 2, armed with the 44 caliber long gun, has been sold to the [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]], [[Sweden]], [[Spain]], [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], amongst others<ref>Jerchel (1998), pp. 36<U+2013>42</ref>.  [[Egypt]] manufactured 700<U+2013>800 M1A1 Abrams by 2005,<ref>Green (2005), p. 25</ref> while in 2008 Egypt requested permission to build another 125 tanks; the M256 main guns, arming the tanks, were manufactured by [[General Dynamics]].<ref>Defense Industry Daily, ''[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/egypt-847m-request-for-125-m1a1-tanks-03684/ Egypt: $889M Request for 125 M1A1 Tanks]'', accessed 9 November 2008</ref>  The M1A1 has also been exported to [[Australia]],<ref>Jane's Defense Weekly (subscription), ''[http://www.janes.com/extract/jdw2004/jdw08159.html Australia prepares for M1A1s]'', accessed 9 November 2008</ref> while the M1A2 Abrams has been exported to [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait]].<ref>Green (2005), p. 34</ref>
