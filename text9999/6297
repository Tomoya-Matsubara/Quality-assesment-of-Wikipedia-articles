The '''Stadium of Light''' is an [[all-seater stadium|all-seater]] [[association football|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], England. With space for 49,000&nbsp;spectators, the Stadium of Light has the [[List of English football stadia by capacity|fifth-largest capacity]] of any English football stadium. The stadium primarily hosts [[Sunderland A.F.C.]] matches.

As well as hosting Sunderland games, the stadium has hosted two matches for the [[England national football team]], as well as one [[England national under-20 football team|England under-20 football team]] match. With an original capacity of 42,000, it was expanded in 2002 to seat 49,000, and its simple design is expected to allow for redevelopments up to an eventual capacity of 64,000. The attendance record at the Stadium of Light is 48,353 set on 13 April 2002, when Sunderland played Liverpool. Along with hosting football matches, the stadium hosted two concerts in 2009, with [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Take That]] as main performers. The ground also holds conference and banqueting suites, the ''Black Cats Bar'', and a club shop selling Sunderland merchandise.

On 16 December 2009 the stadium was selected as a venue to be included in the [[The Football Association|The Football Association's]] bid to host the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/8414235.stm|title=World Cup Bid Cities announced|publisher= BBC News|date=16 December 2009|accessdate=16 December 2009}}</ref> 

==History==
Following the release of the [[Taylor Report]] in January 1990, Sunderland were obliged to make plans to turn their [[Roker Park]] home into an all-seater stadium, as they were then in the Second Division and all clubs in the First and Second Divisions would be required to have all-seater stadiums by August 1994 and the Third and Fourth Divisions by August 1999.<ref name="roker">Days, pp297-298.</ref> Roker Park was a ground that mainly consisted of standing terraces, and if converted into all-seater it would have held far fewer spectators than before.<ref name="roker"/> Enclosed by residential streets on all sides, expansion was practically impossible. So, in the early 1990s, Sunderland began investigating the possibility of relocation.<ref name="roker"/>

The front-runner that emerged was a proposed stadium located on an area of land adjacent to the [[Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) Ltd|Nissan car plant]].<ref name="possiblestadium">Days, pp299-300</ref> The 48,000 seater gound was labelled "the [[Wembley Stadium (1924)|Wembley]] of the North".<ref name="possiblestadium"/> The plans did not come to fruition. In 1992, [[Nissan]] launched an official objection, ultimately forcing Sunderland to abandon the idea.<ref name="possiblestadium"/> In 1995, Sunderland put forward a plan to build a 34,000-seat bowl-shaped stadium on the former site of [[Wearmouth Colliery]].<ref name="possiblestadium"/> The area, on the north bank of the [[River Wear]] in the Sheepfolds district of Sunderland, was only a few hundred yards from Roker Park, and close to the centre of the city. On 13 November 1995, the Sunderland Chairman [[Bob Murray (businessman)|Bob Murray]] announced that the [[Tyne and Wear Development Corporation]] had approved plans for Sunderland to build the new stadium on the site.<ref name="p301">Days, p301</ref>

[[Image:Stadium of light Haway the lads.jpg|thumb|right|The North Stand, bearing the slogan "Ha'way The Lads".]]

Ballast Wiltshier plc, a contracting company that had built the [[Amsterdam Arena]], was contracted to build the stadium at an initial cost of <U+00A3>15&nbsp;million.<ref name="p301"/> In June 1996, as the planned capacity rose to 42,000, construction work began.<ref name="p301"/> The capacity was revised again in early 1997, and the stadium was completed on time, with a capacity of 42,000.<ref name="p301"/> In 2003 the club announced plans to increase the groud capacity to 49,000, however relegation that year put such plans on hold. 

Should the club attain consistent top half finishes the stadium was designed for expansion by addition of an upper tier, up to a maximum capacity of 64,000 <U+2013> which in relation to the current capacities of other English clubs would only be surprassed by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United's]] [[Old Trafford]].<ref name="p300"/>

During construction, the stadium had not adopted an official name, and had been known colloquially as the "Wearside Stadium" and "New Roker Park".<ref name="p302">Days, p302</ref> The name was eventually revealed as the Stadium of Light, a reference to a miner's lamp (the stadium is built on the site of the old [[Wearmouth Colliery]], and many Sunderland fans have worked in the region's mines).<ref name="p302"/> This was an unpopular choice at the time, as there was already a famous "Stadium of Light" in Portugal, which was the home of [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]. To emphasise the local origins of the name choice, a [[Davy lamp]] is in front of the stadium's ticket office, adjacent to the stadium.<ref name="p302"/> The stadium was opened on 30 July 1997 by [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]], with bands such as [[Status Quo]], [[Upside Down (boyband)|Upside Down]] and [[Kavana]] playing. To celebrate the opening of the stadium, Sunderland played a [[Exhibition game#Association football|friendly]] against [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], which was drawn 0<U+2013>0.<ref name="p301"/> The first competitive game was against Manchester City which Sunderland won 3<U+2013>1. The attendance was 34,776.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The North Stand was extended in 2000 to bring the capacity to 49,000, costing the club a further <U+00A3>7&nbsp;million, making the final cost of the stadium <U+00A3>23&nbsp;million.<ref name="p300">Days, p303</ref> On 18 July 2006, a statue of [[1973 FA Cup Final]] winning manager [[Bob Stokoe]] (who died two years earlier) was unveiled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.safc.com/news/?page_id=9960|title=Stokoe statue unveiled|last=Alexander|first=Nick|publisher=Sunderland A.F.C.|date=18 July 2006|accessdate=6 December 2008}}</ref> At the end of season [[The Football League|Football League]] awards, the Stadium of Light was named the ''Best Away Ground'', with other contenders including [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]]'s [[Alexandra Stadium]] and [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]]'s [[Home Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.safc.com/articles/article.php?page_id=11883|title=SoL voted best away ground|last=Alexandra|first=Nick|publisher=Sunderland A.F.C.|date=5 March 2007|accessdate=6 December 2008}}</ref> Sunderland celebrated the ten year anniversary of the stadium with a pre-season friendly against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] on 6 August 2007, the game was drawn 1<U+2013>1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2007/aug/06/newsstory.sunderland|title=Keane eyes Mido and Gordon as Ranieri backs Black Cats to surprise|last=Taylor|first=Louise|date=6 August 2007|accessdate=6 December 2007}}</ref>
