'''Walther Rathenau''' ([[September 29]], [[1867]] <U+2013> [[June 24]], [[1922]]) was a [[Germany|German]] industrialist and politician who served as [[Foreign Minister of Germany]].

==Family==
Rathenau was born in [[Berlin]], the son of [[Emil Rathenau]], a prominent [[Jew]]ish businessman and founder of the Allgemeine Elektricit<U+00E4>ts-Gesellschaft ([[AEG]]) electrical-engineering company. He studied physics, chemistry and philosophy in Berlin and [[Strasbourg]]. He worked as an engineer before joining the AEG board in [[1899]], becoming a leading industrialist in the late [[German Empire]] and early [[Weimar Republic]] periods. Rathenau is thought to be the basis for the German industrialist character Arnheim in [[Robert Musil|Robert Musil's]] novel ''[[The Man Without Qualities]].''

==Political career==
Rathenau was a leading proponent of a policy of [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]] for German Jews: he argued that Jews should oppose both [[Zionism]] and [[socialism]], but should instead integrate themselves into mainstream German society. This, he said, would eventually lead to the disappearance of [[anti-Semitism]].

His wealthy, Jewish heritage and political engagement and decisions caused aversion within the extreme right, which later led to his assassination in 1922.

During [[World War I]] Rathenau held senior posts in the Raw Materials Department of the War Ministry, as well as becoming chairman of AEG on his father's death in [[1915]]. He played the leading role in putting Germany's economy in a war footing, and enabling Germany to continue its war effort for four years despite acute shortages of labour and raw materials.

After the war Rathenau, a moderate liberal in politics, was one of the founders of the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP). He rejected the tide of socialist thought which swept Germany after the shock of defeat and revolution, opposing state ownership of industry and advocating greater worker participation in the management of companies. His ideas were influential in post war governments.

In [[1921]] Rathenau was appointed Minister of Reconstruction, and in [[1922]] he became Foreign Minister. His insistence that Germany should fulfill its obligations under the [[Treaty of Versailles]], while working for a revision of its terms, infuriated German nationalists. He  also angered nationalists by negotiating the [[Treaty of Rapallo]] with the [[Soviet Union]]. The leaders of the (still obscure) [[Nazi Party]] and other right wingers claimed he was part of a "Jewish-Communist conspiracy." 

The British politician [[Robert Boothby]] wrote of him: "He was something that only a German Jew could simultaneously be: a prophet, a philosopher, a mystic, a writer, a statesman, an industrial magnate of the highest and greatest order, and the pioneer of what has become known as 'industrial rationalization'."

In fact, despite his desire for economic and political co-operation between Germany and the Soviet Union, Rathenau remained skeptical of the Soviets' methods. In his ''Kritik der dreifachen Revolution'' ("Critique of the triple revolution"), he noted: 

: "''We cannot use Russia's methods, as they only and at best prove that the economy of an agrarian nation can be leveled to the ground; Russia's thoughts are not our thoughts. They are, as it is in the spirit of the Russian city intelligence, unphilosophical and highly dialectic; they are passionate logic based on unverified suppositions. They assume that a single good, the destruction of the capitalist class, weighs more than all other goods, and that poverty, dictatorship, terror and the fall of civilization must be accepted to secure this one good.'' 

: "''If ten million people must die to free ten million people from the bourgeoisie, then this is a harsh but necessary consequence. The Russian idea is compulsory happiness, in the same sense and with the same logic as the compulsory introduction of Christianity and the Inquisition."

==Assassination==
On [[June 24]], [[1922]] Rathenau was assassinated by two right-wing army officers linked to [[Organisation Consul]]. When one morning he was driving from his house to the Wilhelmstra<U+00DF>e, as he did daily, his car was passed by another in which three armed young men sat. They simultaneously shot at the minister with machine guns and then quickly drove away. A memorial stone in the K<U+00F6>nigsallee in Berlin-Grunewald commemorates the crime. One of the assassins was the future writer [[Ernst von Salomon]]. 

Rathenau's assassination may have significantly influenced the long-term political and economic development of Europe. It was certainly an early sign of the instability and violence which were eventually to destroy the Weimar Republic. The British writer [[Morgan Philips Price]] wrote:

: "''In June [[1922]] Walter Rathenau, a big Jewish industrialist and progressive economist, was assassinated by gangsters of the extreme Right who were the heart and soul of the [[Freikorps]]. I was present at the memorial service in the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] and noted an extraordinary outburst of enthusiasm among the workers of Berlin, as expressed in their trade union leaders and socialist parties, for the Republic and for President [[Friedrich Ebert|Ebert]]. The rank and file of the Majority Social Democrats were now thoroughly aroused... First Communists, then Socialists, and now a big industrialist were murdered for having Liberal views and, in the last case, for being a Jew. The situation in Germany was becoming more and more sinister.''".
