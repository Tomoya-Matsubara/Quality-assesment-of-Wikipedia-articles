'''New York State Route&nbsp;96''' ('''NY&nbsp;96''') is a {{convert|126.01|mi|km|2|sing=on}} northwest<U+2013>southeast [[state highway]] in the [[Finger Lakes]] region of [[New York]] in the United States. The southern terminus of the route is at an interchange with [[New York State Route 17|NY&nbsp;17]] in the [[Southern Tier]] village of [[Owego (village), New York|Owego]], [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga County]]. Its northern terminus is at a junction with East Main Street in the city of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe County]]. Between the two endpoints, NY&nbsp;96 passes through the [[Ithaca (city), New York|city of Ithaca]] and the villages of [[Waterloo (village), New York|Waterloo]], [[Victor (village), New York|Victor]], and [[Pittsford (village), New York|Pittsford]]. NY&nbsp;96 is signed north<U+2013>south for its entire length, although most of the route in [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] travels in an east<U+2013>west direction.

All of NY&nbsp;96, except from [[Candor (village), New York|Candor]] to Ithaca and from northwest of Victor to Pittsford, was originally designated as part of '''New York State Route&nbsp;15''' in 1924. NY&nbsp;15 was originally routed on modern [[New York State Route 96B|NY&nbsp;96B]] between Candor and Ithaca, and modern [[New York State Route 64|NY&nbsp;64]] and [[New York State Route 251|NY&nbsp;251]] between Victor and Pittsford. It was realigned onto the modern alignment of NY&nbsp;96 between Victor and Pittsford in 1930. NY&nbsp;15 was renumbered to '''New York State Route&nbsp;2''' ca. 1939 to eliminate duplication with [[U.S. Route 15 in New York|U.S. Route&nbsp;15]] (US&nbsp;15). NY&nbsp;2 was subsequently redesignated as NY&nbsp;96 in the early 1940s as the alignments of NY&nbsp;2 and [[New York State Route 96 (1930 <U+2013> early 1940s)|NY&nbsp;96]], a route in [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer County]], were swapped. NY&nbsp;96 was realigned again in the early 1950s, this time between Candor and Ithaca, to serve the [[Spencer (village), New York|village of Spencer]] west of Candor. Near Rochester, NY&nbsp;96 followed what is now [[Interstate 490 (New York)|Interstate&nbsp;490]] (I-490) for a short time during the 1950s and early 1960s.

==Route description==
Most of NY&nbsp;96's {{convert|126|mi|0}} are maintained by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT); however, three sections of the route in [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins County]] and [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe County]] are maintained by local highway departments. In the Tompkins County [[Ithaca (city), New York|city of Ithaca]], NY&nbsp;96 is city-maintained from the southern city line to the start of the Fulton/Meadow Street [[one-way couplet]], at which point maintenance of the highway reverts to NYSDOT. The route is also maintained by Ithaca from Park Road to the western city limits.<ref name="inv-tomp">{{cite web |url=https://www.nysdot.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-repository2/INV_2010-03-02_tompkins.csv |title=Tompkins County Inventory Listing |date=March 2, 2010 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=November 21, 2010}}</ref> The last locally-owned section is in the Monroe County city of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], where the entirety of NY&nbsp;96 within the city is city-maintained.<ref name="inv-mon">{{cite web |url=https://www.nysdot.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-repository2/INV_2010-03-02_monroe.csv |title=Monroe County Inventory Listing |date=March 2, 2010 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=November 21, 2010}}</ref>

===Tioga County===
Though unsigned at this point,<ref name="yahoo1">{{yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=42.520025&lon=-76.61661&zoom=10&q1=42.094115%2C-76.262841&q2=42.209861%2C-76.492266&q3=42.440609%2C-76.508445&q4=42.945853%2C-76.974721 |title=overview map of NY 96 from Owego to Phelps |accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref> NY&nbsp;96 begins at the eastbound onramp to [[New York State Route 17|NY&nbsp;17]] at exit&nbsp;64 on Southside Drive across the [[Susquehanna River]] from the [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga County]] village of [[Owego (village), New York|Owego]].<ref name="2008tvr" /> The route remains unsigned until the intersection of Court Street and Southside Drive, the western terminus of [[New York State Route 434|NY&nbsp;434]]. NY&nbsp;434 continues east along Southside Drive while NY&nbsp;96, now fully signed, turns north onto Court Street and crosses the Susquehanna River. On the opposite side of the river, NY&nbsp;96 intersects Front Street. The configuration of NY&nbsp;96 between Front Street and East Main Street is unorthodox in that NY&nbsp;96 splits at Front Street to follow a [[one-way couplet]] around the [[Tioga County Courthouse]] to Main Street, where both streets terminate. NY&nbsp;96 turns onto Main Street for half a block to North Avenue, where it resumes its northward path. The route shares the parallel one-way streets with [[New York State Route 17C|NY&nbsp;17C]], which enters Owego from the west via Main Street and leaves via Front Street to the east.<ref name="yahoo1" />

[[File:Split on NY 96 in Owego.jpg|thumb|left|South end of the one-way couplet in Owego]]
Now on North Avenue, NY&nbsp;96 passes through the heart of Owego before leaving the village and following Owego Creek into a long stretch of rural country. Just over {{convert|1|mi|1}} north of Owego village in the [[Owego (town), New York|town of Owego]], NY&nbsp;96 meets the southern terminus of [[New York State Route 38|NY&nbsp;38]]. At this point, NY&nbsp;38 becomes the creekside highway while NY&nbsp;96 passes over Owego Creek and follows Catatonk Creek northwest into the [[Candor (town), New York|town of Candor]]. Once in Candor, the route and the creek turn northward toward the [[Candor (village), New York|village of Candor]], where NY&nbsp;96 meets [[New York State Route 96B|NY&nbsp;96B]], an alternate route of NY&nbsp;96 between Candor and the [[Ithaca (city), New York|city of Ithaca]]. Past NY&nbsp;96B, NY&nbsp;96 turns to the west and crosses over Catatonk Creek as it exits the village. West of Candor, NY&nbsp;96 follows an east<U+2013>west alignment through a creek valley to the [[Spencer (village), New York|village of Spencer]], where the route converges with [[New York State Route 34|NY&nbsp;34]] and heads north into another valley leading to [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins County]].<ref name="yahoo1" />

===Tompkins County===
The two routes remain [[overlap (road)|concurrent]] as they snake to the northwest through Tompkins County. Southwest of the city of Ithaca in the [[Ithaca (town), New York|town of Ithaca]], NY&nbsp;34 and NY&nbsp;96 meet [[New York State Route 13|NY&nbsp;13]]. The three routes continue northeast through the town, intersecting [[New York State Route 327|NY&nbsp;327]] and [[New York State Route 13A|NY&nbsp;13A]] before crossing over the inlet of [[Cayuga Lake]] and entering the city of Ithaca on Meadow Street. Here, NY&nbsp;96B reconnects to its parent at the junction of Clinton and Meadow Streets. North of this point, Meadow Street splits into a one-way couplet, with Fulton Street carrying southbound traffic and Meadow Street handling northbound traffic. [[New York State Route 79|NY&nbsp;79]], also routed on a one-way couplet here, crosses NY&nbsp;96 at Green and Seneca Streets, with NY&nbsp;79 eastbound using one block of Fulton Street to travel from State Street to Green Street.<ref name="yahoo1" />

[[File:NY 89-96 north in Ithaca.jpg|thumb|NY&nbsp;89 and NY&nbsp;96 northbound in Ithaca]]
One block north of NY&nbsp;79, NY&nbsp;96 splits from NY&nbsp;13 and NY&nbsp;34 and heads to the west at Buffalo Street. [[New York State Route 89|NY&nbsp;89]] begins here, and NY&nbsp;96 overlaps with NY&nbsp;89 toward the West End of Ithaca. After crossing southbound NY&nbsp;13 and NY&nbsp;34, NY&nbsp;89 and NY&nbsp;96 run parallel to and a few feet to the north of NY&nbsp;79. NY&nbsp;89 turns north onto Taughannock Boulevard at the next intersection while NY&nbsp;96 continues west across the lake outlet as Cliff Street, paralleling NY&nbsp;79.<ref name="yahoo1" /> They do not intersect in this area<U+2014>known locally as The Octopus<U+2014>though they once did. At one time, NY&nbsp;96, NY&nbsp;79, NY&nbsp;89, NY&nbsp;13A and Elm Street met at an intersection that gave the area its name.<ref name="ithaca west topo">{{cite map |url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/usgspreview/index.cfm?code=o42076d5 |title=Ithaca West Quadrangle <U+2013> New York <U+2013> Tompkins Co. |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |series=7.5 Minute Series (Topographic) |year=1978 |scale=1:24,000 |accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref> Today, only NY&nbsp;13A and NY&nbsp;79 intersect there while the stub of former NY&nbsp;89 is now a park access road that intersects with NY&nbsp;96, which continues north out of the Cayuga Lake valley as Trumansburg Road.<ref name="yahoo1" />

Unlike NY&nbsp;89, which runs along the base of the valley and parallels the west shore of Cayuga Lake, NY&nbsp;96 heads away from the lake, increasing the distance between itself and the water body as it proceeds northwestward to the highlands overlooking the lake. The route heads across open fields and past isolated pockets of homes toward [[Trumansburg, New York|Trumansburg]], where NY&nbsp;96 crosses over Taughannock Creek and serves [[Taughannock Falls State Park]] southeast of the village. In Trumansburg itself, the highway becomes Main Street and meets the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 227|NY&nbsp;227]] in the center of the community. NY&nbsp;96 continues on, exiting Trumansburg just {{convert|250|yd|0}} before crossing the [[Seneca County, New York|Seneca County]] line.<ref name="yahoo1" />

===Seneca County===
NY&nbsp;96 proceeds northwest through a lightly populated section of Seneca County and the town of [[Covert, New York|Covert]] to the village of [[Interlaken, New York|Interlaken]], home to the southern terminus of [[New York State Route 96A|NY&nbsp;96A]], a more westerly alternate route of NY&nbsp;96 between Interlaken and [[Geneva (city), New York|Geneva]]. Outside of the village, NY&nbsp;96 continues on a northwesterly path for another {{convert|4.5|mi|1}} to the [[Ovid (town), New York|Ovid]]<U+2013>[[Romulus, New York|Romulus]] town line, where it turns due west for {{convert|2|mi|1}} to access the [[Ovid (village), New York|village of Ovid]]. The route mostly bypasses the village, with NY&nbsp;96A and [[New York State Route 414|NY&nbsp;414]] serving as its Main Street instead. The three routes meet at a junction on the northern fringe of the community, at which point NY&nbsp;96A leaves NY&nbsp;414 and turns west to follow the town line toward [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]] while NY&nbsp;96 joins NY&nbsp;414 and heads north into the town of Romulus.<ref name="yahoo1" />

[[File:NY 96 south at Main St Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|NY&nbsp;96 southbound at US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 in [[Waterloo (village), New York|Waterloo]]]]
Midway between the village of Ovid and the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of Romulus, the two routes split, allowing NY&nbsp;414 to continue due north to [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls]]. NY&nbsp;96, meanwhile, turns to the northwest, following the eastern edge of the [[Seneca Army Depot]] for most of the distance to Romulus hamlet. Just south of the community's center, NY&nbsp;96 separates from the depot grounds and continues north through the hamlet and into the town of [[Varick, New York|Varick]]. The route uneventfully crosses the town, passing by open fields on a predominantly northward alignment on its way to the [[Fayette, New York|Fayette]] town line and a junction with [[New York State Route 336|NY&nbsp;336]], an east<U+2013>west connector between NY&nbsp;96A and NY&nbsp;414. NY&nbsp;96 continues across rural terrain to the outskirts of the [[Waterloo (village), New York|village of Waterloo]], where the number of homes rises as the route enters the village on Fayette Street.<ref name="yahoo1" />

In the southern half of the village, the highway follows a zig-zag routing as it leaves Fayette Street at River Road before returning to the north at Washington Street one block to the east. While on Washington Street, the route passes over the [[Cayuga<U+2013>Seneca Canal]] and enters the village's center, changing names to Virginia Street in the process. Not far to the north, NY&nbsp;96 heads into Waterloo's central business district, built up around the junction of Virginia and Main ([[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]] and [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]]) Streets. Past Routes&nbsp;5 and&nbsp;20, NY&nbsp;96 continues north as a residential street to the village line, where the route turns to the west with a slight trend to the north. At this point, the scenery surrounding NY&nbsp;96 shifts from house-lined streets to rural countryside once again, an appearance that follows the road to the northwest through the [[Waterloo (town), New York|town of Waterloo]] and across the county line.<ref name="yahoo1" />

===Ontario County===
[[File:NY 96 south at NY 14.jpg|thumb|right|Approaching [[New York State Route 14|NY&nbsp;14]] on NY&nbsp;96 south]]
Although NY&nbsp;96 travels mostly in an east<U+2013>west direction throughout [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]], it is still signed as a north<U+2013>south highway. Less than {{convert|1|mi|1}} into the county, NY&nbsp;96 connects to [[New York State Route 14|NY&nbsp;14]] by way of a [[cloverleaf interchange]], an oddity considering the rural location of the interchange.<ref name="yahoo1" /> West of NY&nbsp;14, NY&nbsp;96 begins to parallel the paths of both the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]]) and the [[Canandaigua Lake]] outlet to the north. The highway follows both entities across the [[Phelps (town), New York|town of Phelps]] to the [[Phelps (village), New York|village of the same name]], where NY&nbsp;96 meets the southern terminus of [[New York State Route 88|NY&nbsp;88]]. Just west of the village, NY&nbsp;96 intersects the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 488|NY&nbsp;488]],<ref name="yahoo2">{{yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=43.054014&lon=-77.291099&zoom=12&q1=42.945853%2C-76.974721&q2=42.971518%2C-77.176741&q3=42.985709%2C-77.416895&q4=43.046207%2C-77.46805&q5=43.086212%2C-77.517146 |title=overview map of NY 96 from Phelps to Pittsford |accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref> formerly part of NY&nbsp;88.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York and New Jersey Tourgide<!--sic--> Map |publisher=[[Gulf Oil Company]] |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]] |year=1972 |edition=1972}}</ref> West of the intersection, a northward reverse S-curve draws NY&nbsp;96 closer to the Thruway and the outlet as the route heads toward the village of [[Clifton Springs, New York|Clifton Springs]], which NY&nbsp;96 bypasses to the north.<ref name="yahoo2" />

{{convert|4|mi|0}} to the west in the [[Manchester (village), New York|village of Manchester]], NY&nbsp;96 crosses over the outlet (which roughly follows [[New York State Route 21|NY&nbsp;21]] south to Canandaigua Lake from this point out) and indirectly connects to the Thruway by way of a junction with NY&nbsp;21 located north of the village center and just south of where NY&nbsp;21 meets the Thruway at exit&nbsp;43. West of NY&nbsp;21, NY&nbsp;96 curves gently to the south, crossing the [[Ontario Central Railroad]] before resuming its westward alignment near the [[grade crossing]]. At this point, NY&nbsp;96 enters the town of [[Farmington, New York|Farmington]] and begins to parallel the Thruway once more. The route passes by [[Finger Lakes Gaming and Race Track]], located between [[County Route 8 (Ontario County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;8]] (CR&nbsp;8) and [[New York State Route 332|NY&nbsp;332]], prior to intersecting NY&nbsp;332 itself {{convert|0.5|mi|1}} west of the race track.<ref name="yahoo2" />

[[File:Rochester Eastview Mall.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eastview Mall]], with NY&nbsp;96 at bottom]]
From this point northwestward to [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], NY&nbsp;96 passes through substantially more developed areas. The first of these is the nearby [[Victor (village), New York|village of Victor]], which NY&nbsp;96 enters by way of an overpass carrying it over the Ontario Central Railroad. In the village itself, the route meets the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 444|NY&nbsp;444]], which travels north<U+2013>south between Victor and [[Bloomfield, New York|Bloomfield]]. West of the village in the [[Victor (town), New York|town of Victor]], NY&nbsp;96 runs along the base of a valley separating it from the Thruway, where it intersects the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 251|NY&nbsp;251]]. The route continues on a northwesterly track for another mile (1.6&nbsp;km) before curving to the north and widening from two to four lanes as it passes under the Thruway near exit&nbsp;45. [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]], which begins at Thruway exit&nbsp;45, is accessible from NY&nbsp;96 by way of exit&nbsp;29, the eastern-most exit on I-490.<ref name="yahoo2" />

The section of NY&nbsp;96 between exit&nbsp;29 and [[New York State Route 250|NY&nbsp;250]] in [[Perinton, New York|Perinton]] serves as a major commercial strip, anchored by the presence of [[Eastview Mall]], one of the largest malls in the Rochester area and the largest east of the city. Also present along this stretch of NY&nbsp;96 are a series of plazas, beginning with one just north of I-490 featuring a [[Wal-Mart]] and a [[Kohl's]]. Continuing northward, NY&nbsp;96 runs along the eastern edge of Eastview Mall and passes two more plazas, one of which is developed around a [[K-Mart]]. The highway gradually turns northwest toward the county line as it passes the mall, and crosses into [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe County]] at an intersection leading to Eastview Commons, a plaza separated from the mall by high-voltage power lines and a large ditch.<ref name="yahoo2" />

===Monroe County===
[[File:NY 96 south at NY 31.jpg|thumb|Entering Pittsford and approaching NY&nbsp;31 on NY&nbsp;96 southbound]]
Roughly a quarter of a mile (0.4&nbsp;km) from the county line, the commercial surroundings end as NY&nbsp;96 intersects the southern terminus of NY&nbsp;250 in the town of Perinton. {{convert|0.75|mi|2}} to the northwest, NY&nbsp;96 meets I-490 once again, this time at exit&nbsp;28. West of the exit, NY&nbsp;96 parallels I-490 for roughly {{convert|1.25|mi|2}}, serving several office parks and Powder Mills Park before reconnecting to the freeway at exit&nbsp;27, located on the southern edge of [[Bushnell's Basin, New York|Bushnell's Basin]], a small hamlet located directly on NY&nbsp;96. North of the exit, NY&nbsp;96 breaks from I-490 and parallels the [[Erie Canal]] through slightly less developed areas between Bushnell's Basin and Mitchell Road in the [[Pittsford (town), New York|town of Pittsford]], where it narrows to two lanes and becomes East Jefferson Road.<ref name="yahoo2" />

West of Mitchell Road, NY&nbsp;96 takes a more southerly alignment than the canal as it enters the densely populated [[Pittsford (village), New York|village of Pittsford]] and meets the northern and eastern termini of [[New York State Route 64|NY&nbsp;64]] and [[New York State Route 252|NY&nbsp;252]], respectively, at the intersection of Jefferson Road and South Main Street. NY&nbsp;64 heads to the south along South Main Street and NY&nbsp;252 continues along Jefferson Road to the west while NY&nbsp;96 turns north, proceeding into the heart of the village along South Main Street.<ref name="yahoo2" /> In the village center, NY&nbsp;96 intersects Monroe Avenue and State Street, which carry [[New York State Route 31|NY&nbsp;31]] east<U+2013>west through Pittsford. The route continues on, becoming North Main Street as it crosses the Erie Canal and passes under the [[CSX Transportation]]-owned [[West Shore Subdivision]]. Just north of the railroad overpass is a junction with the southern terminus of [[New York State Route 153|NY&nbsp;153]], the most direct route between Pittsford and nearby [[East Rochester, New York|East Rochester]].<ref name="yahoo3">{{yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=43.122915&lon=-77.546067&zoom=13&q1=43.086212%2C-77.517146&q2=43.135462%2C-77.537058&q3=43.148238%2C-77.565897&q4=43.154625%2C-77.591818&q5=43.157881%2C-77.604693 |title=overview map of NY 96 from Pittsford to Rochester |accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref>

[[File:NY 96 north at Winton Rd.jpg|thumb|left|The last NY&nbsp;96 marker heading northbound at Winton Road in Rochester]]
Past NY&nbsp;153, NY&nbsp;96 exits the village of Pittsford and becomes East Avenue, a name the route retains to its terminus in [[downtown Rochester]]. It proceeds northward through the heavily residential town, passing by [[Nazareth College (New York)|Nazareth College]] and meeting the western terminus of [[New York State Route 31F|NY&nbsp;31F]] (Fairport Road) at a junction adjacent to the campus of [[St. John Fisher College]]. East Avenue, and likewise NY&nbsp;96, takes on the northwesterly, four-lane alignment set by Fairport Road and begins to parallel the routing of I-490 once more as both enter the town of [[Brighton, Monroe County, New York|Brighton]]. Not far to the northwest of the town line, NY&nbsp;96 meets Elmwood and Linden Avenues, the latter carrying [[New York State Route 441|NY&nbsp;441]]. About {{convert|1|mi|1}} to the northwest, NY&nbsp;96 intersects Penfield Road,<ref name="yahoo3" /> the pre-expressway alignment of NY&nbsp;441.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Shell Oil Company]] |cartography=[[H.M. Gousha Company]] |year=1973 |edition=1973}}</ref> One block from this point is Clover Street, which carries [[New York State Route 65|NY&nbsp;65]] south of East Avenue.<ref name="yahoo3" />

At the Brighton<U+2013>Rochester town line, NY&nbsp;96 passes through the center of the [[Can of Worms (interchange)|Can of Worms]], a complex interchange that links I-490 to [[Interstate 590|I-590]]. Here, I-590 passes under NY&nbsp;96 while I-490 flies over NY&nbsp;96. On the other side of the interchange in Rochester, East Avenue becomes a commercial strip once again, but to a lesser extent than in Victor. At North Winton Road, NY&nbsp;96 is signed for the last time by way of a "North&nbsp;96" reassurance assembly directing traffic to stay on East Avenue.<ref name="yahoo3" /> Despite this fact, the route officially continues northwestward toward [[downtown Rochester]].<ref name="2008tvr" />

West of Winton, NY&nbsp;96 passes through the [[East Avenue Historic District]], a primarily residential area with historic upper-class houses, including the [[George Eastman House]].<ref name="yahoo3" /> This stretch of the route was narrowed in mid-2010 from four lanes to two, to improve the residential feel and reduce automobile speeds.<ref name="Restriping">{{cite news |last=Levato |first=Ray |title=Major change planned for East Ave |url=http://www.whec.com/news/stories/S1541188.shtml?cat=566 |work=[[WHEC-TV]] |location=[[Rochester, New York]] |accessdate=November 22, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRJkic75 |archivedate=November 22, 2010 |date=May 3, 2010}}</ref>  At Alexander Street, the environment turns more commercial as the route enters the downtown area.

By 1926, [[New York State Route 31|NY&nbsp;31]] was assigned across western and central New York, utilizing Monroe Avenue from downtown Rochester to Pittsford.

In the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]], NY&nbsp;15 basically remained intact. The only change made at this time was the straightening out of the Victor<U+2013>Pittsford segment, which now bypassed Mendon in favor of a more direct alignment between the two villages via [[Bushnell's Basin, New York|Bushnell's Basin]]. The former alignment of NY&nbsp;15 became part of [[New York State Route 251|NY&nbsp;251]] east of Mendon and part of NY&nbsp;64 north of the hamlet.<ref name="1930nyt">{{cite news |last=Dickinson |first=Leon A. |title=New Signs for State Highways |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 12, 1930 |page=136}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=Road Map of New York |year=1930 |publisher=Standard Oil Company of New York |cartography=General Drafting}}</ref> Ca. 1939, [[U.S. Route 15 in New York|US&nbsp;15]] was extended into New York, replacing [[New York State Route 2 (1927<U+2013>1939)|NY&nbsp;2]], which had extended from the [[New York <U+2013> Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] to Rochester.
