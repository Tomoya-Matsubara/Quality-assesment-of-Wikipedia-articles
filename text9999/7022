{{nihongo|'''''Satsuma'''''|<U+85A9><U+6469> (<U+6226><U+8266>)||Satsuma (senkan}} was a [[semi-dreadnought]] [[battleship]] built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) in the first decade of the 20th Century. [[Lead ship]] of her [[Satsuma-class battleship|class]], she was the first battleship built in Japan. She was named for [[Satsuma Province]], now a part of [[Kagoshima prefecture]]. The ship saw no combat during [[World War I]], although she led a [[squadron (naval)|squadron]] that occupied several German colonies in the [[Pacific Ocean]] in 1914. ''Satsuma'' was disarmed and sunk as a target in 1922<U+2013>24 in accordance with the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922.

==Background==
The ''Satsuma'' class was ordered in late 1904 under the 1904 War Naval Supplementary Program during the [[Russo-Japanese War]].<ref>Itani, Lengerer & Rehm-Takahara, p. 53</ref> Unlike the previous {{sclass-|Katori|battleship|0}} [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s, they were the first battleships ordered from Japanese shipyards, although ''Satsuma'' used a lot of imported components.<ref name=e9>Evans & Peattie, p. 159</ref> They were originally designed with a dozen {{convert|12|in|adj=on|0}} guns, but had to be redesigned because of a shortage of guns in Japan<ref name=g8/> and to reduce costs.<ref name=e9/>

==Design and description==
[[File:SatsumaDrawing.jpg|thumb|left|Line drawing of the battleship ''Satsuma'' from Brassey's Naval Annual 1912]]
The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|482|ft|m|1}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|83|ft|6|in|m|1}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|27|ft|6|in|m|1}}. She displaced {{convert|19372|LT|t|lk=in}} at normal load. The crew ranged from 800 to 940 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=j7>Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 23</ref>

''Satsuma'' was powered by a pair of [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]], each driving one propeller, using steam generated by 20 Miyabara [[water-tube boiler]]s using a mixture of coal and [[fuel oil]]. The engines were rated at a total of {{convert|17300|ihp|lk=in}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|18.25|kn|lk=in}}. During the ship's [[sea trial]]s she reached {{convert|18.95|kn}} from {{convert|18507|ihp|abbr=on}}.<ref name=j7/> ''Satsuma'' carried enough coal and oil to give her a range of {{convert|9100|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref name=p5>Preston, p. 195</ref>

The ship was completed with four 45-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] [[EOC 12 inch/45 naval gun|12-inch 41st Year Type guns]] in two gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the [[superstructure]].<ref name=j7/> They fired {{convert|850|lb|kg|adj=on|0}}<ref>Friedman, pp. 272</ref> [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] (AP) shells to a maximum range of {{convert|22000|m|yd|abbr=on|disp=flip}}.<ref>Itani, Lengerer & Rehm-Takahara, p. 67</ref> The [[Battleship secondary armament|intermediate armament]] consisted of six twin-gun turrets equipped with 45-caliber [[Vickers 10 inch /45 naval gun|Type 41 10-inch guns]], three turrets on each side of the superstructure.<ref name=p5/> Her heavy intermediate armament is why the ship is considered to be a semi-dreadnought.<ref name=j7/>

''Satsuma'' was equipped with a dozen 40-caliber [[QF 4.7 inch Gun Mk I<U+2013>IV|4.7-inch 41st Year Type]] [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF) guns]], mounted in casemates in the sides of the hull.<ref name=p5/> The ship was also equipped with four 40-caliber [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12-pounder 12-cwt QF guns]]<ref group=Note>"Cwt" is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.</ref> and four 28-caliber [[8-centimeter/40 41st Year Type naval gun|12-pounder QF guns]].<ref name=j7/> In addition, she was fitted with five submerged {{convert|18|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s, two on each [[broadside]] and one in the stern.<ref name=p5/>

The [[waterline]] [[armor belt|main belt]] of the ''Satsuma''-class vessels consisted of [[Krupp cemented armor]] that had a maximum thickness of {{convert|9|in|mm|0}} [[amidships]]. It tapered to a thickness of {{convert|4|in|mm|0}} inches at the ends of the ship.<ref name=g8/> A {{convert|6|in|0|adj=on}} [[strake]] of armor protected the casemates.<ref name=j7/> The barbettes for the main guns were {{convert|7|-|9.5|in}} thick. The armor of ''Satsuma''{{'}}s main gun turrets had a maximum thickness of nine inches. The [[Deck (ship)|deck]] armor was {{convert|2|-|3|in|mm|0}} thick and the [[conning tower]] was protected by six inches of armor.<ref name=g8>Gardiner & Gray, p. 238</ref>

==Construction and career==
''Satsuma'', named for [[Satsuma Province]],<ref>Silverstone, p. 336</ref> was [[Keel|laid down]] at [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]] on 15 May 1905.<ref name=g8/> She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 15 November 1906 with [[Emperor Meiji]], the [[Minister of the Navy of Japan|Navy Minister]], and other high officials on hand for the ceremony,<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9D05E1D91631E733A25755C1A9679D946797D6CF&oref=slogin|title=Mikado Attends Launching|date=16 November 1905|work=New York Times|publisher=New York Times Co.|accessdate=11 June 2013}}</ref><ref>Schencking, pp. 117<U+2013>18</ref> and completed on 25 March 1910.<ref name=j7/> At the time of her launching, ''Satsuma'' had the largest displacement of any battleship in the world.<ref name=nyt/>

On 5 August 1911, the ship suffered an explosion in one of her 12-inch guns when it failed to fire during gunnery practice. After some time passed, the [[breech]] was opened and ignited the propellant; the resulting fire killed 16 crewmen and several officers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/105327501?searchTerm=battleship%20satsuma&searchLimits=l-decade=191|title=Gun Accident|date=7 August 1911|work=Daily Herald (Adelaide, South Australia)|page=5|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref> 
She was lightly damaged by a typhoon on 22 September 1912.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86063760/1912-10-02/ed-1/seq-1/#date1=1910&index=0&rows=20&words=battleship+Satsuma&searchType=basic&sequence=0&state=&date2=1919&proxtext=battleship%2Bsatsuma&y=17&x=11&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1|title=Many Lives Are Lost: Great Damage Wrought in Japan by Terrific Storm|date=2 October 1912|work=The Manning Times|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref> ''Satsuma'' was assigned to the 1st Battleship Squadron when World War I began in August 1914.<ref name=p5/> She served as [[Rear Admiral]] [[Tatsuo Matsumura]]'s flagship in the [[Second South Seas Squadron]] as it seized the German possessions of the [[Caroline Islands|Caroline]] and the [[Palau Islands]] in October 1914.<ref>Peattie, pp. 42<U+2013>43</ref>
''Satsuma'' rejoined the 1st Battleship Squadron in 1915, was refitted at [[Sasebo Naval Arsenal]] in 1916 and served with the 1st Squadron for the rest of the war.<ref name=p5/> Sometime during the war, she was fitted with two 12-pounders on high-angle mounts to serve as [[anti-aircraft gun]]s.<ref name=g8/>

The ship was disarmed at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in 1922 to comply with the provisions of the Washington Naval Treaty, stricken from the [[Navy List]] on 20 September 1923 and converted into a target ship. ''Satsuma'' was sunk by the battleships {{ship|Japanese battleship|Nagato||2}} and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Mutsu||2}} in [[Tokyo Bay]] on 7 September 1924.<ref name=j7/>
