"'''Say Say Say'''" is a pop song that was written and performed by [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Michael Jackson]]. The track was produced by [[George Martin]] for McCartney's fifth solo album, ''[[Pipes of Peace]]'' (1983).   The song was recorded during production of McCartney's 1982 ''[[Tug of War (album)|Tug of War]]'' album, about a year before the release of "The Girl Is Mine"<U+2014>the pair's first duet from Jackson's record-breaking album, ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'' (1982). After its release in October 1983, "Say Say Say" became Jackson's seventh top-ten hit inside a year. It was a number one hit in the United States, Norway, and Sweden, reached number two in the United Kingdom, and peaked within the top ten in Australia, Austria, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Switzerland.

[[Music recording sales certification|Certified]] platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], the song was promoted with a music video directed by [[Bob Giraldi]]. The video, filmed in [[Santa Ynez Valley]], California, featured cameo appearances by [[Linda McCartney]] and [[La Toya Jackson]]. The short film centers around two con artists called "Mac and Jack" (played by McCartney and Jackson), and is credited for the introduction of dialogue and storyline to music videos. The video was considered by the National Coalition on Television Violence to be too violent for broadcast in the US.

==Background, recording and composition==
McCartney had already collaborated with Jackson on "[[The Girl Is Mine]]", from the latter's ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'', and in return Jackson agreed to work on "Say Say Say" for McCartney's ''[[Pipes of Peace]]''.<ref>Stephen Thomas Erlewine & William Ruhlmann.

"This is the way to make big money", the musician informed Jackson. "Every time someone records one of these songs, I get paid. Every time someone plays these songs on the radio, or in live performances, I get paid." McCartney's words influenced Jackson's later purchase of the [[Northern Songs]] music catalogue in 1985.<ref name="tara 333"/>

McCartney played several instruments on "Say Say Say", including percussion, synthesiser, guitar and bass guitar. The [[harmonica]] was played by Chris Smith, and the [[rhythm guitar]] was played by David Williams. The song was engineered by [[Geoff Emerick]].<ref>Linear notes of ''Pipes of Peace'' by Paul McCartney</ref> The production of "Say Say Say" was completed in February 1983, after it had been refined and [[overdubbing|overdubbed]] at [[Cherokee Studios]] in [[California]]. [[George Martin]], who had worked with The Beatles, produced the song.

He's not a musician in the sense that Paul is ... but he does know what he wants in music and he has very firm ideas."<ref name="coleman 129"/><ref name="grant 268"/> Jackson also spoke of the experience in his autobiography, ''[[Moonwalk (book)|Moonwalk]]''. The younger singer revealed that the collaboration boosted his confidence, as [[Quincy Jones]]<U+2014>producer of ''Thriller''<U+2014>was not present to correct his mistakes.

==Release and reception==
Following the release of ''Thriller'' and most of its singles, "Say Say Say" was released on 3 October 1983 by [[Parlophone Records]] in the UK and [[Columbia Records]] in the US.<ref name="grant 68">Grant, p. 68</ref><ref name="harry 171">Harry, p. 171</ref><ref name="hill 381">Hill, p. 381</ref> It remained atop [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'''s Hot 100]] for six weeks and became Jackson's seventh top ten hit of 1983, breaking a record that until then was held jointly by The Beatles and [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name="everett 282">Everett, p. 282</ref><ref name="Campbell 68">Campbell, p. 68</ref><ref name="lewis 6">Lewis, p. 6</ref> Also in the US, "Say Say Say" reached number two on the [[R&B chart]] and number three on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]] chart.<ref name="George 39">George, p. 39</ref> Although the song had peaked at number ten in the UK, it began to fall steadily; McCartney subsequently held an early weekday live television interview, where he discussed the song's music video. This, along with screenings of the video on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' (which normally played only singles that were rising in the charts), ''[[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]]'' and [[Noel Edmonds]]' ''[[The Late, Late Breakfast Show]]'', helped propel the song to number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="Barrow 92">Barrow, p. 92</ref><ref name="heryanto 92">Herynato, p. 92</ref> "Say Say Say" reached number one in Norway and Sweden, and the single also reached the top ten in Austria, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.<ref name="Barrow 92"/><ref name="Austria"/> With wholesale shipments of at least one million units, the single was later [[music recording sales certification|certified]] platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH|title=RIAA database|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=30 April 2009}} (To search the database for "Say Say Say", type "Paul McCartney" or "Michael Jackson" into the Artist field and "Say Say Say" into the Title field.)</ref>

In the short film, the duo play "Mac and Jack", a pair of conmen who sell a "miracle potion". The salesman (McCartney) offers Jackson the potion, and claims that it is "guaranteed to give you the strength of a raging bull". Jackson drinks the potion and challenges a large man to arm wrestle. Unbeknownst to a watching crowd, the man<U+2014>along with Linda<U+2014>is also in on the scam. After Jackson wins the rigged contest, the crowd of people surge forward and buy the potion. Mac and Jack then donate all of the money earned from the scam to an orphanage.<ref name="Campbell 69"/> Later, while in a hotel, Jackson enters the bathroom as McCartney shaves. The latter playfully dabs shaving foam on Jackson's cheek, despite the fact that the younger man does not need a shave.

===Themes===
Two authors later reviewed the short film and documented two central themes. The first is a "Child/Man" theme; the role of both a boy and an adult, which writer James M. Curtis states Jackson plays throughout the music video for "Say Say Say".<ref name="Curtis 323"/> Curtis writes that the bathroom scene involving the shaving foam is reminiscent of boys copying their fathers. He adds that the scene marks "the distinction between Michael's roles as a Child and as a Man". The writer also highlights the part where the singer supposedly becomes strengthened with a miracle potion, a further play on the "Child/Man" theme.<ref name="Curtis 323"/> Furthermore, Curtis observes that Paul and Linda McCartney seem to act as if they are Jackson's parents in the short film.<ref name="Curtis 323"/> The author also notes that in a scene where Jackson is handed a bouquet of flowers from a girl, it is a reversal of one from ''[[City Lights]]'', a 1931 film starring [[Charlie Chaplin]], whom the singer greatly adored.<ref name="Curtis 323"/>

The second of the two main themes in the music video is of [[African American history]] and [[African American culture|culture]], as some of the vaudeville scenes in the short film acknowledge [[minstrel shows]] and [[blackface]].<ref name="Lhamon 219"/> Author W. T. Lhamon writes that the video is set in the Californian Depression, and that McCartney and Jackson "convey a compactly corrupt history of blackface" as they con their way to riches with the Mack and Jack show.<ref name="Lhamon 219"/> Lhamon was critical of the pair and of the video because he felt that the African American theme had not been made explicitly known. The author expressed his view that aspects of the short film were historically out-of-synch with interracial relations.<ref name="Lhamon 219"/> He stated, "Nearly everything in the video is backward. Mack's white hand continually helping black Jack on board, for instance, reverses the general process I have shown of blacks providing whites with their sustaining gestures."<ref name="Lhamon 219"/> Lhamon added, "In a just world, Jackson should be pulling McCartney onto the wagon, not the other way around."<ref name="Lhamon 219"/>
