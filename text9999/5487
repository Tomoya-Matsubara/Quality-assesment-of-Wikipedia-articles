Born in [[Mackay, Queensland]], Mellor grew up in Scotland, Australia and South Africa before undertaking tertiary studies at [[Adelaide Centre for the Arts|North Adelaide School of Art]], the [[Australian National University]] (ANU) and [[Birmingham Institute of Art and Design]]. He then took up a post lecturing at [[Sydney College of the Arts]]. He works in different media including [[printmaking]], drawing, painting, and sculpture. The dominant theme in Mellor's art is the relationship between [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous]] and non-Indigenous Australian cultures.

Since 2000, Mellor's works have been included regularly in National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award exhibitions; in 2003 he was awarded a "highly commended", for his print ''Cyathea cooperi'', and in 2009 he won the principal prize, for a mixed media work ''From Rite to Ritual''. His other major exhibitions have included the ''Primavera 2005'' show at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney]], and the National Indigenous Art Triennial at the [[National Gallery of Australia]] in 2007. In 2012, his work was included in the [[National Museum of Australia]]'s exhibition ''Menagerie: contemporary Indigenous sculpture'' as well as in the second National Indigenous Art Triennial.

==Career==
In the early 1990s, Mellor won drawing prizes at the ANU's Canberra School of Art and the [[Grafton, New South Wales|Grafton]] Regional Gallery in New South Wales. Through the mid-1990s, while studying in Canberra and Birmingham, he was represented in numerous student and other exhibitions, in Australia, Belgium, Japan, Korea and the United Kingdom. These included exhibitions titled ''Passage'', at [[Kyoto Seika University]] in Japan in 1994, and ''Fragile Objects'' at the [[National Library of Australia]] in 1996.<ref name="Fireworksbio"/>

Mellor's works have been included in the [[National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award]] on several occasions, in 2000, 2001, and every year from 2003 to 2010.

[[File:Mellor From Rite to Ritual.jpg|right|thumb|Mellor's ''From Rite to Ritual'' (2009)]]
Mellor's extensive scholarly art education has led to his art having a strong theoretical base.<ref name="Rothwell09" /> In interviews he has acknowledged the influence of diverse artists, including Indigenous painter [[Rover Thomas]], Australian [[Sir John Sulman Prize|Sulman Prize]] winner [[Tim Storrier]], [[German Romanticism|Romantic]] painters including Germany's [[Caspar David Friedrich]], and contemporary German artists [[Joseph Beuys]], and Beuys' student [[Anselm Kiefer]].<ref name="MCAQ&A"/> He has harnessed a wide range of media during his career, including printmaking, drawing, painting and sculpture utilising wood, glass, steel and ceramics,<ref name="DAAO#2"/> as well as a range of more unorthodox materials, as his 2007 Indigenous Art Triennial entry demonstrated. Reflecting on that sculpture, ''[[Artlink Magazine]]'''s reviewer, Daniel Thomas, remarked on how the work signified "how colonisers always get things wrong; how Europeans looking for China, and its fine porcelain manufactures, stumbled instead upon the land of the kangaroo, and traded and planted ideas of racial and cultural superiority".<ref name="Thomas">{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Daniel|year=2007|title=Indigenous Triennial (review)|journal=[[Artlink Magazine]]|volume=27|issue=4|url=http://www.artlink.com.au/articles.cfm?id=3049|accessdate=28 August 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110719150636/http://www.artlink.com.au/articles.cfm?id=3049 |archivedate=19 July 2011 }}</ref>

When Sarah Scott considered the 2008 work ''Exotic Lies and Sacred Ties'', which, like ''From Rite to Ritual'', drew on evocations of Spode china, she highlighted its exploration of the history of cross-cultural relations. Noting the landscape that forms the central element of the painting, she observed:
{{quote|The stuffed parrot and upside-down cockatoo that hang above the landscape recall the bizarre renditions of these birds produced by European artists following the eighteenth century European voyages of discovery to Australia. In front of the 'landscape' are two mosaic kangaroo 'messengers.' One kangaroo points to the painting. Another covers his ears in a 'hear no evil' gesture, graphically signifying how under the black armband view of history&nbsp;... , the oral history accounts of Indigenous people have been largely ignored.

''From Rite to Ritual'' examined relationships between Indigenous and settler cultures, including differences in spiritual practices. Mellor, in an artist's statement for the awards, described the work as showing "what is a moment of contact, a conversation and interaction between two cultures; it speaks of the challenges of settlement, and the differences in spiritual enactment and belief".<ref name="NATSIAAmain">{{cite web|url=http://www.artsandmuseums.nt.gov.au/museums/natsiaa/previous-telstra-national-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-art-awards/26natsiaa|title=26th Telstra National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award (NATSIAA)|work=nreta museums > exhibitions > natsiaa >|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.artsandmuseums.nt.gov.au%2Fmuseums%2Fnatsiaa%2Fprevious-telstra-national-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-art-awards%2F26natsiaa&date=2012-10-18 |archivedate=19 October 2012 |publisher=Museums and Art Galleries of the Northern Territory|accessdate=17 August 2009}}</ref> Commenting on the work, the judges of the prize remarked that the "surprising scale and layering of imagery, with its understated political and historical references" made the work "outstanding" and of "great complexity and grace".<ref name="NATSIACat09">{{cite book|last=26th Telstra National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award|title=Catalogue|publisher=Northern Territory Government|date=August 2009}}</ref> Art writer Nicholas Rothwell described the work as drawing a parallel "between Aboriginal initiation rituals and the ceremonies inside a Masonic lodge."<ref name="Rothwell09">{{cite news|title=Winning work leaps out of the box|last=Rothwell|first=Nicholas|date=15 August 2009|work=[[The Weekend Australian]]|page=7|accessdate=17 August 2009}}</ref> {{quote box|align=right|quoted=1|width=40%|fontsize=95%|quote=[It] takes a deeper look at, you might say, a ceremonial narrative&nbsp;...

Themes around the relationships between cultures were examined in Mellor's earlier works, including in his mezzotint prints in which he juxtaposed "images of native and introduced flora and fauna<U+2014>for example, a kangaroo with a bull<U+2014>to symbolise two different peoples and cultures".<ref name="QAG2003"/> These issues were also addressed in his painting for the exhibition ''Native Titled Now'', shown in South Australia in 1996.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mellor|first=Doreen|coauthors=Vincent Megaw|year=1996|title=The Land Made Visible: 'Native Titled Now'|journal=[[Artlink Magazine]]|volume=16|issue=4|pages=6<U+2013>8}}</ref> Mellor's interest in cultural interactions extends beyond the making of his art. In a panel discussion on Indigenous art education, Mellor emphasised that, in teaching Indigenous art within visual arts, it was important to be aware of both Aboriginal and settler history, "so you can talk about their interaction and the whole set of issues that arise from those two things being parallel".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Vivien|year=2006|title=Indigenous art: how should it be taught?|journal=[[Artlink Magazine]]|volume=26|issue=1|page=56}}</ref>

For Mellor, Indigenous identity is a theme highlighted both in his work and (not necessarily by his own choice) in public life. As a fair-skinned man with blue eyes and caucasian features, his appearance has occasionally raised questions of "authenticity".<ref name="O'Riordan"/> Mellor found himself the target of columnist [[Andrew Bolt]], who took issue with Mellor entering and winning the 2009 National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award. Bolt wrote "This white university lecturer, with his nice Canberra studio, has by winning pushed aside real draw-in-the-dirt Aboriginal artists such as Dorothy Napangardi, Mitjili Napanangka Gibson and Walangkura Napanangka, who'd also entered and could really have used that cash and recognition."<ref name="Bolt1">{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/opinion/white-fellas-in-the-black/story-e6frfifo-1225764532947|title=White fellas in the black|last=Bolt|first=Andrew|date=21 August 2009|work=Herald Sun|accessdate=20 November 2012|archivedate=27 September 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/621idShxJ}}</ref> Commentator Ellie Savage, criticising Bolt, wondered why someone who "neither draws in the dirt nor lives in it" should therefore have "no right to enter competitions for
indigenous artists".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Savage|first=Ellie|year=2011|title=Andrew Bolt and free speech|journal=Eureka Street|volume=21|issue=6|pages=25|url=http://www.eurekastreet.com.au/uploads/File/pdf/110408.pdf}}</ref> Bolt two years later lost a case brought by nine Indigenous Australians -not including Mellor- for racial discrimination over articles that criticised fair-skinned Indigenous people, including the post that had lambasted Mellor.<ref>{{cite journal|year=2011|title=Eatock v Bolt|journal=Federal Court of Australia|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2011/1103.html}}</ref> Art writer Maurice O'Riordan, reviewing the 2009 Award, noted the Bolt controversy, but pointed out that Mellor, while in early works acknowledging his own Indigenous heritage, is not concerned with the definition of Aboriginality, but with historical interaction between cultures and the re-imagining of history.<ref name="O'Riordan"/>
