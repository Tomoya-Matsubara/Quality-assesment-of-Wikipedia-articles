The '''Gibraltar Artificial Reef''', or simply the '''Gibraltar Reef''' is the ongoing [[artificial reef]] project for the [[Mediterranean sea|Mediterranean waters]] surrounding the [[British overseas territories|British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. The initiative was started in 1973 by Dr. Eric Shaw of the [[Helping Hand Trust]]. 

It consists of a collection of [[shipwreck|sunken wrecks]] designed to give [[marine biology|marine wildlife]] an environment to breed and colonise.

==History==
Initially experiments were tried with [[tire|tyres]] chained together but sand movement and currents proved to be too strong and washed the tyres away or buried them. Benthic stones were used but they also suffered from [[tidal force]] and proved too expensive. This was followed by sinking of [[automobile|cars]] and monitoring the effects of sealife upon them, including a [[Mercedes-Benz]] that was towed out behind a [[boat]] prior to being sunk, driven by diver and instructor [[Steven Hensaw]].

Finally boats and [[barge]]s were to be donated by the [[Gibraltar Port Authority]] and local [[marina]]s. These boats were thoroughly cleaned and emptied of all [[pollutant]]s prior to sinking and every location mapped. The first boats were two barges donated by ''[[Gibunco]]'' in 1974 and sunk in [[Camp Bay]].

In 2006 the 65 ton wooden boat "True Joy" also known as <U+201C>Noah<U+2019>s Ark<U+201D>, was sunk here.<ref>Gibraltar Nature News No11 Spring 2006 Gonhs offical News letter.

In 2013 the reef was extended by the sinking of concrete blocks. This caused a diplomatic row, as Spain claimed that these blocks were ripping fishing nets and began discussions of whether to place a tax on visitors into Gibraltar from Spain, and close Spain's aerospace for flights inbound to Gibraltar.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23574507</ref>

==Diving==
Gibraltar's [[reef]] has become a major attraction for both local and Spanish recreational [[underwater diving|divers]].
