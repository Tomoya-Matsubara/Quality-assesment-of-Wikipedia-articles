'''Virginia State Route 31''' (SR 31) is a primary [[state highway]] in the U.S. state of [[Virginia]].  The state highway runs {{convert|24.56|mi|km}} from [[U.S. Route 460 in Virginia|U.S. Route 460]] (US 460) in [[Wakefield, Virginia|Wakefield]] north to [[Virginia State Route 5|SR 5]] and [[Virginia State Route 199|SR 199]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]].  SR 31 is the primary north&ndash;south highway of [[Surry County, Virginia|Surry County]], where the highway serves the towns of [[Surry, Virginia|Surry]] and [[Dendron, Virginia|Dendron]].  The state highway also connects Williamsburg with [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]].  The sections of SR 31 on either side of the [[James River]] are connected by the [[Jamestown Ferry]].

==Route description==
SR 31 begins at an intersection with US 460 in the town of Wakefield in [[Sussex County, Virginia|Sussex County]].  The state highway heads east on Main Street, which continues west of US 460 as SR 628.  At the eastern town limit, SR 31 veers north onto Birch Island Road.  The state highway becomes Rolfe Highway when it enters Surry County right before the highway crosses the [[Blackwater River]].  SR 31 heads northeast through town of Dendron and the hamlet of Elberon.  The state highway [[concurrency (road)|runs concurrently]] with [[Virginia State Route 10|SR 10]] (Colonial Trail) while passing through the town of Surry.  North of Surry, SR 31 passes [[Smith's Fort Plantation]] before reaching the [[Scotland, Virginia|Scotland]] terminal of the Jamestown Ferry across the James River.  The Jamestown Ferry is the only crossing of the James River between the [[James River Bridge]] in [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] and the [[Benjamin Harrison Memorial Bridge]] near [[Hopewell, Virginia|Hopewell]].<ref name="Google Maps VA 31"/>

SR 31 resumes at the Jamestown terminal of the ferry at [[Glass House Point]] in [[James City County, Virginia|James City County]].  The state highway, which heads northeast as Jamestown Road, passes [[Jamestown Festival Park]] and has an intersection with [[Virginia State Route 359|SR 359]], a short connector between SR 31 and [[Colonial Parkway]].  SR 31 leaves Jamestown and crosses over Powhatan Creek and Lake Powell.  The state highway passes through the suburban area surrounding Williamsburg before reaching its northern terminus at SR 199 (Humelsine Parkway) just inside the city limits.  Jamestown Road continues northeast as SR 5 beyond SR 199; westbound SR 5 joins SR 199 in a short concurrency west toward [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].<ref name="Google Maps VA 31"/>

==History==
The first piece of the present SR 31 to exist as a state highway ran from [[Williamsburg, VA|Williamsburg]] southwest to [[Jamestown, VA|Jamestown]]. It was a spur of [[State Route 9 (Virginia pre-1923)|State Route 9]]<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.virginiadot.org/meetings/minutes_pdf/CTB-05-1920-01.pdf Minutes of Special Meetings of the State Highway Commission held in Culpeper, Amelia, and Richmond, Virginia, May 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14, 1920]|103&nbsp;KB}}, page 6</ref> (roughly current [[U.S. Route 60 (Virginia)|U.S. Route 60]]), and was present in the initial 1918 system.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.virginiadot.org/meetings/minutes_pdf/CTB-07-1922-01.pdf Minutes of the First Meeting of the State Highway Commission Created Under the Acts of 1922, Held July 5th, 1922, Richmond, Va.]|150&nbsp;KB}}, Proposed "State Highway System" for Virginia, as Recommended by the State Roads Committee, January, 1918</ref> SR 9 was renumbered as [[State Route 39 (Virginia pre-1933)|State Route 39]] in the [[1923 renumbering (Virginia)|1923 renumbering]], and the Yorktown spur became '''State Route 392'''.

The [[Jamestown-Scotland Ferry]] began operations February 26, 1925 from the Jamestown end of SR 392 to [[Scotland, VA|Scotland]] across the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]].<ref>[http://www.virginiadot.org/comtravel/ferry-jamestown-history.asp VDOT: Jamestown-Scotland Ferry]</ref>

The road on the Scotland side was added to the state highway system from 1926 to 1931, at first as an extension of [[State Route 351 (Virginia pre-1928)|State Route 351]],<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.virginiadot.org/meetings/minutes_pdf/CTB-05-1926-01.pdf Minutes of a Special Meeting Held by the State Highway Commission at Roanoke, and Richmond, Virginia, May 5, and 7, 1926]|237&nbsp;KB}}, pages 19 and 22</ref> but soon as part of SR 392. In the [[1928 renumbering (Virginia)|1928 renumbering]] the route was renumbered '''State Route 510'''.<!--see talk page for full sources - maybe I'll add them later-->

Capitol Landing Road from [[Williamsburg, VA|Williamsburg]] to [[Magruder, VA|Magruder]] was added to the state highway system in 1932<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.virginiadot.org/meetings/minutes_pdf/CTB-05-1932-01.pdf Minutes of the Meeting of the State Highway Commission of Virginia, Held in Marion, May 25, 1932]|149&nbsp;KB}}, page 10</ref><ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.virginiadot.org/meetings/minutes_pdf/CTB-06-1932-01.pdf Minutes of the Meeting of the State Highway Commission of Virginia, Held in Richmond, June 10, 1932]|212&nbsp;KB}}, page 15</ref> as '''State Route 542'''.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.virginiadot.org/meetings/minutes_pdf/CTB-06-1932-01.pdf Minutes of the Meeting of the State Highway Commission of Virginia, Held in Richmond, June 10, 1932]|212&nbsp;KB}}, page 6</ref> Later that year, both SR 510 and SR 524 became '''State Route 31''', connected by Francis Street in Williamsburg ([[U.S. Route 60 (Virginia)|U.S. Route 60]], formerly [[State Route 39 (Virginia pre-1933)|State Route 39]]).
