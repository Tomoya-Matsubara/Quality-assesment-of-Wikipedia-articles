'''Mikhail Nikolaevitch Baryshnikov''' ({{lang-ru|<U+041C><U+0438><U+0445><U+0430><U+0438><U+043B> <U+041D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+043B><U+0430><U+0435><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+0411><U+0430><U+0440><U+044B><U+0448><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432>}}) (born [[January 27]], [[1948]]) is a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-born [[Russian American]] [[dancer]], [[choreographer]], and [[actor]], often cited alongside [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] and [[Rudolf Nureyev]] as one of the greatest [[ballet]] dancers of the 20th century. After a promising start in the [[Kirov Ballet]] in [[Leningrad]], he defected to [[Canada]] in 1974 for more opportunities in western dance.  After freelancing with many companies, he joined the [[New York City Ballet]] as a principal dancer to learn [[George Balanchine]]'s style of movement.  He then moved to dance and later became artistic director with the [[American Ballet Theatre]], also in New York.  

Baryshnikov has spearheaded many of his own artistic projects and has been associated in particular with promoting [[modern dance]], premiering dozens of new works, including many of his own.  His success as a dramatic actor on stage, cinema and television has helped him become probably the most widely recognized contemporary ballet dancer.

==Biography==
Born in [[Riga]], now in independent [[Latvia]], Baryshnikov began his ballet studies there in 1960. In 1964, he entered the [[Vaganova School]], in what was then [[Leningrad]] (now again [[St. Petersburg]]).  Baryshnikov soon won the top prize in the junior division of the International Varna Competition. He joined the [[Kirov Ballet]] and made his debut at the [[Mariinsky Theater]] in 1967, dancing the <U+201C>Peasant<U+201D> [[pas de deux]] in ''[[Giselle]]''. Recognizing Baryshnikov's talent, in particular the strength of his stage presence and purity of his classical technique, several Soviet [[choreographers]], including  Oleg Vinogradov, Konstantin Sergeyev, Igor Tchernichov, and Leonid Jakobson, created ballets for him. Baryshnikov made signature roles of Jakobson's 1969 virtuosic ''Vestris'' along with an intensely emotional Albrecht in ''Giselle''.<ref name="KCbio">{{cite web|url = http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showIndividual&entitY_id=3693&source_type=A/|title = Biography of Mikhail Baryshnikov|accessdate = 2008-01-29|publisher = [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]]}}</ref>  While still in the Soviet Union, he was called by ''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[Clive Barnes (critic)|Clive Barnes]] "the most perfect dancer I have ever seen".<ref name="KCbio" />

While on a tour in [[Canada]] with the [[Kirov Ballet]] in [[1974]], Baryshnikov [[defection|defected]], requesting [[political asylum]] in [[Toronto]].  He later stated that Christina Berlin, an [[United States|American]] friend of his, helped engineer his defection during his 1970 tour of London. His first performance after coming out of temporary seclusion in Canada was with the [[National Ballet of Canada]] in a televised version of ''[[La Sylphide]]''. He then went on to the United States.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Dance Autobiography|author=Makarova, Natalia|publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]]|date=[[1979-11-12]]|isbn=0394501411|page=152}}</ref>

From 1974 to 1979, he was principal dancer with the [[American Ballet Theatre]] (ABT), where he partnered with [[Gelsey Kirkland]].  He also worked with the [[New York City Ballet]], with [[George Balanchine]].  He also toured with ballet and [[modern dance]] companies around the world for fifteen months.  Several roles were created for him, including roles ''Opus 19: The Dreamer'' (1979), by [[Jerome Robbins]], ''Rhapsody'' (1980), by [[Frederick Ashton]], and ''Other Dances'' with [[Natalia Makarova]] by Jerome Robbins. He returned to ABT in 1980 as dancer and artistic director, a position he held for a decade. On [[July 3]], [[1986]], he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. From [[1990]] to [[2002]], Baryshnikov was artistic director of the [[White Oak Dance Project]], a touring company he co-founded  with [[Mark Morris]]. In 2004 he launched the Baryshnikov Arts Centre in New York.

==Artistic career==
===Dance===
Baryshnikov's talent was obvious from his youth, but the Soviet system in which he grew up was ill-suited for developing it.  Shorter than most dancers, he could not tower over a ballerina ''en pointe'' and was therefore relegated to secondary parts. More frustrating to him, the Soviet dance world hewed closely to 19th-century traditions and deliberately shunned the creative choreographers of the West, whose work Baryshnikov glimpsed in occasional tours and films. His main goal in leaving Russia was to work with these innovators; in the first two years after his defection, he danced for no fewer than 13 different choreographers, including [[Jerome Robbins]], [[Glen Tetley]], [[Alvin Ailey]], and [[Twyla Tharp]]. "It doesn't matter if every ballet is a success or not," he told ''New York Times'' dance critic Anna Kisselgoff in 1976, "The new experience gives me a lot." He cited his fascination with the ways Ailey mixed classical and modern technique and his initial discomfort when Tharp insisted he incorporate eccentric personal gestures in the dance.

In 1978, he abandoned his freelance career to spend 18 months as a principal of the [[New York City Ballet]], run by the legendary [[George Balanchine]]. "Mr. B," as he was known, rarely welcomed guest artists and had refused to work with both [[Nureyev]] and Makarova; Baryshnikov's decision to devote his full attentions to the New York company stunned the dance world. Balanchine never created a new work for Baryshnikov, though he did coach the young dancer in his distinctive style, and Baryshnikov triumphed in such signature roles as [[Apollo]], [[Prodigal Son]], and [[Rubies]]. Robbins did, however, create ''Opus 19: The Dreamer'' for Baryshnikov and NYCB favorite Patricia McBride <ref>{{cite book|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Ballet|author=Koegler, Horst|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=[[1982-10-14]]|isbn=0193113309}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Repertory in Review: 40 Years of New York City Ballet|author=Reynolds, Nancy|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|date=September 1977|isbn=038527100X}}</ref> In 1980, he became Artistic Director of [[American Ballet Theatre]] and his role changed from performer to director.

Nevertheless, his fascination with the new has stood him in good stead. While his technique has lost its flash, his mastery of gesture and stagecraft remains compelling. As he observed, "It doesn't matter how high you lift your leg. The technique is about transparency, simplicity and making an earnest attempt.<U+201D><ref>{{cite book|title=Baryshnikov at Work|author=Baryshnikov, Mikhail|publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]]|date=[[1978-03-12]]|isbn=0394735870}}</ref> The White Oak Project was formed to create original work for older dancers. In a run ending just short of his 60th birthday in 2007, he appeared in a production of four short plays by [[Samuel Beckett]] staged by avant-garde director [[JoAnne Akalaitis]]. Joining discipline and charisma, he has fashioned an exceptionally long career and cast a long shadow over the contemporary dance world.

He has received three Honorary Degrees; on September 28, 2007 from Shenandoah Conservatory of Shenandoah University, on May 11, 2006, from New York University, and on May 23, 2008 from Montclair State University.

For the duration of the 2006 Summer, he went on tour with [[Hell's Kitchen Dance]], which was sponsored by the Baryshnikov Arts Center. Featuring works by Baryshnikov Arts Center residents Azsure Barton and Benjamin Millipied, the company toured the United States and Spain.

In late August 2007 Baryshnikov performed [[Mats Ek]]'s ''Place'' (original Swedish title, ''St<U+00E4>lle'') with Ana Laguna at Dansens Hus in [[Stockholm]].

===Film and television===
Baryshnikov made his American television dancing debut in 1976, on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] program ''In Performance Live from [[Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts|Wolf Trap]]''. During the [[Winter holiday season|Christmas season]] of 1977, [[CBS]] brought his highly acclaimed production at the American Ballet Theatre of Tchaikovsky's classic ballet ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' to television, and it has remained to this day the most popular and most often shown television production of the work. In addition to Baryshnikov in the title role, [[Gelsey Kirkland]], and  [[Alexander Minz]] and the dance company also starred. The production was videotaped in [[Canada]]. After being shown twice by CBS, it moved to PBS, where it was shown annually every Christmas season for many years. Some PBS stations still televise it annually.  The [[DVD]] of the performance is a bestseller during the Christmas season. Although Tchaikovsky's ballet has been presented on TV many times, the Baryshnikov version is one of only two versions of "The Nutcracker" to be nominated for an [[Emmy Award]].  The other dance nominated was [[Mark Morris]]' "The Hard Nut," his intentionally exaggerated and satirical version of the ballet. 

Baryshnikov also performed in two Emmy-winning television specials, one on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and one on CBS, in which he danced to music from [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] and [[Hollywood]], respectively. During the 1970s and 80s, he appeared many times with American Ballet Theatre on ''[[Live from Lincoln Center]]'' and ''[[Great Performances]]''. Over the years, he has also appeared on several telecasts of the [[Kennedy Center Honors]].

Baryshnikov performed in his first film role soon after arriving in New York.  He acted as the character Yuri Kopeikine, a famous Russian ballet dancer, in the [[1977 in film|1977]] film ''[[The Turning Point (1977 film)|The Turning Point]]'', for which he received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination .  Additionally, he co-starred with [[Gregory Hines]] in the [[1985 in film|1985 film]] ''[[White Nights (film)|White Nights]]'', choreographed by [[Twyla Tharp]], and the 1987 [[film]] ''[[Dancers (film)|Dancers]].'' In the last season of ''[[Sex and the City]]'', he played a Russian artist that had a romance with Carrie Bradshaw, [[Carrie Bradshaw#Aleksandr Petrovsky|Aleksandr Petrovsky]].  

On November 2, 2006, Baryshnikov and chef [[Alice Waters]] were featured on an episode of the [[Sundance Channel]]'s original series ''Iconoclasts.'' The two have a lifelong friendship. They discussed their lifestyles, sources of inspiration, and social projects that make them unique. During the program, Alice Waters visited Baryshnikov's Arts Center in New York City. The Hell's Kitchen Dance tour brought him to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] to visit Alice Waters' restaurant ''[[Chez Panisse]].''

On July 17, 2007, the PBS ''[[News Hour with Jim Lehrer]]'' featured a profile of Baryshnikov and his Arts Center.

==Family==
Baryshnikov has a daughter, Aleksandra Baryshnikova (born 1981), from his relationship with actress [[Jessica Lange]]. When Baryshnikov and Lange met, he was able to speak very little English.  They had to communicate in French instead. 

Baryshnikov is in a long-term relationship with former ballerina [[Lisa Rinehart]].  They have had three children together: Sofia, Anna, and Peter. In an interview with [[Larry King]], Baryshnikov said that he didn't believe in marriage because the commitment that people make to each other didn't have anything to do with a legal marriage. He stated that he wasn't religious, so standing in front of an altar would not mean anything to him.<ref name="CNNtrans">{{cite web|url = http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0205/05/lklw.00.html|title = CNN Larry King Weekend: Interview with Mikhail Baryshnikov|accessdate = 2008-01-29|date = 2002-05-05|publisher = [[CNN]]}}</ref>
