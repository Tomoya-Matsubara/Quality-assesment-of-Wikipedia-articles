==Biography==
===Early years===
Brennan was born in [[Racine, Wisconsin]], but he attended [[Carl Schurz High School]] in the [[Irving Park, Chicago|Irving Park neghborhood]] of  [[Chicago, Illinois]].  Although he stood six feet, two inches and weighed 200 pounds, he was reportedly "the smallest man in his family in three generations."<ref>{{cite news|author=Drew Middleton|title=Sport Roundup|newspaper=Ellensburg Daily Record|date=1938-12-29|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o1shAAAAIBAJ&sjid=u4QFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4337,5571193&dq=john-brennan+michigan+football+1938&hl=en}}</ref> 

===University of Michigan===
Brennan enrolled at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1935 where he became a member of the school's football and wrestling teams.  He played [[Guard (American football)|guard]] for the [[Michigan Wolverines  football]] teams from 1936 to 1938.<ref name=t36>{{cite web|title=1936 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1936fbt.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=1937 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1937fbt.htm}}</ref><ref name=t38>{{cite web|title=1938 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1938fbt.htm}}</ref> 

As a sophomore in 1936, Brennan was a starter for [[Harry Kipke]]'s football team that finished the season with a record of 1&ndash;6.<ref name=t36/>  At the end of the 1936 season, Brennan sparked a controversy when the [[Associated Press]] reported that he responded to a questionnaire about women students by saying that "four out of five co-eds are beautiful, and the fifth one comes to Michigan."<ref name=Co/><ref>{{cite news|title=4 Out of 5 are Grid Players, 5th at U.

After the poor showing in 1936, Brennan was one of the players who helped turn the program around in 1938 under new head coach [[Fritz Crisler]].  Brennan and All-American [[Ralph Heikkinen]] started every game at the two guard positions for the [[1938 Michigan Wolverines football team|1938 team]] -- a team that finished with a 6&ndash;1&ndash;1 record and featured All-Americans [[Tom Harmon]] and [[Forest Evashevski]] in the backfield.<ref name=t38/>  

The controversy over Brenna's comments about Michigan's co-eds followed him into his senior year.  In January 1939, he was voted the "queen" of the university's ice festival.  The Associated Press picked up the story, which was printed in newspapers across the United States under headlines such as "Campus Beauty Weighs 201 Pounds and Are Coeds Piqued" and "Step Up and Take a Bow Miss Brennan".<ref name=Boy>{{cite news|title=Michigan University Boys Name Man Carnival Queen|newspaper=The Evening Independent (AP story)|date=1939-01-13|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NswLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=z1QDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4639,3034815&dq=john-brennan+michigan+football+1939&hl=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=201-Pound Fullback 'Queen' of Carnival|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune (AP story)|date=1939-01-12|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TXccAAAAIBAJ&sjid=j2QEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3007,838038&hl=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Michigan Queen Of Ice Carnival Statuesque Blond: Campus Beauty Weighs 201 Pounds and Are Coeds Piqued|newspaper=The Hartford Courant|date=1939-01-13|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/844953142.html?dids=844953142:844953142&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Jan+13,+1939&author=&pub=Hartford+Courant&desc=Michigan+Queen+Of+Ice+Carnival+Statuesque+Blond&pqatl=google}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Step Up and Take a Bow Miss Brennan|newspaper=San Antonio Light|date=1939-01-12}}</ref> The AP story reported on the vote as follows:<blockquote>"Lantern-jawed John Brennan, 201-pound varsity football player and wrestler, was chosen 'queen' of the University of Michigan ice carnival in a campus outbreak of monkey-shining today. ... Brennan himself started a campus battle two years ago by observing that 'four out of five women are pretty, and the fifth comes to Michigan.'  Campus aesthetes described Brennan a clipped blond of the type known as statuesque (reinforced concrete, chiseled with a blow torch)."<ref name=Boy/></blockquote>
Sports columnist, Henry J. McCormick, also picked up the story and wrote that the selection of the football player and heavyweight wrestler as queen of the ice carnival was the result of "skulduggery" in the balloting, which was traced to Brennan's earlier "direct slap at the [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pulchritude pulchritude] of Michigan's co-eds," a slap that spawned a campus squabble and "made for some very fine reading in the campus newspaper."<ref>{{cite news|author=Henry J.

===Professional football===
Brennan was selected by the [[Green Bay Packers]] in the 19th round (179th overall pick) of the [[1939 NFL Draft]].  When Brennan signed with the Packers in February 1939, the story was reported under the headline, "'QUEEN' OF MICHIGAN SIGNED BY GREEN BAY".<ref>{{cite news|title='QUEEN' OF MICHIGAN SIGNED BY GREEN BAY|newspaper=San Antonio Express (AP story)|date=1939-02-26}}</ref>  When Brennan showed up at [[Curly Lambeau]]'s training camp, the press continued to refer to him as "the Michigan 'Ice Queen.'"<ref>{{cite news|title=Gantenbein Stars In Packer Drill|newspaper=La Crosse Tribune And Leader-Press|date=1939-08-18}}</ref>  Although official records indicate that Brennan appeared in only two games for the Packers during the [[1939 NFL season]],<ref name=PFR>{{cite news|title=John Brennan profile|publisher=pro-football-reference.com|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BrenJo20.htm}}</ref> newspaper accounts indicate that he appeared in at least three games -- as a starter in the Packers' 31&ndash;0 win over the [[St. Louis Gunners]] on October 15, 1939,<ref>{{cite news|title=PACKERS SCORE EASY 31-0 WIN OVER GUNNERS|newspaper=Oshkosh Daily Northwestern|date=1939-10-16}}</ref> and as a substitute in a 27&ndash;20 win over the [[Chicago Cardinals]] on October 8, 1939,<ref>{{cite news|title=PACKERS STEM CARDS' RALLY TO WIN, 27-20|newspaper=Stevens Point Daily Journal|date=1939-10-09}}</ref> and a 26&ndash;7 win over the [[Detroit Lions]] on October 22, 1939.<ref>{{cite news|title=packers Take to Air and Humble Detroit's Lions|newspaper=Appleton Post-Crescent|date=1939-10-23}}</ref>  Brennan was released by the Packers in October 1939 and signed with the [[Kenosha Cardinals]] of the American Pro Football League.<ref>{{cite news|title=KENOSHA CARDINALS ADD THREE PLAYERS: Play League Game With Louisville Sunday|newspaper=Ironwood Daily Globe|date=1939-10-28}}</ref>  In November 1939, Brennan was added to the Kenosha coaching staff and also continued as a player.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kenosha Plays Dayton Sunday|newspaper=Sheboygan Press|date=1939-11-11}}</ref>
