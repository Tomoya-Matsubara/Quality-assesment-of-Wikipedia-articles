==Events preceding the attack==
On July 3rd, 1980, Arne Johnson's fiancee, Debbie Glatzel, claims to have discovered that her youngest brother David woke sobbing, sayng that he had a vision of an "awful beast", describing it as "a man with big black eyes, a thin face with animal features and jagged teeth, pointed ears, horns and hoofs", and saying it had warned him to "Beware".<ref name="people"/> As his visions persisted, Debbie requested that Johnson come and stay at her families home.<ref name="people"/> A catholic priest came to their house and blessed it, but to seemingly no effect on David. Visions began to occur in the daytime soon afterwords, in the form of an old man with a white beard, wearing a flannel shirt and jeans.<ref name="people"/> The family then called upon [[Demonology|demonologist]]s [[Ed and Lorraine Warren]] of Monroe, Connecticut to assist. Lorraine, who claims to be [[clairvoyant]], stated that she saw a black, misty form next to David, indicating a malevolent presence, and that David complained of invisible hands chocking him, and the feeling of being hit. She also claims that afterwords, there were red marks on his neck.<ref name="people"/> David's condition caused him to start missing school, and David also gained 60 pounds over the next few months.<ref name="people"/> He also began to growl, hiss, speak in strange voices, and suddenly recite passages from the [[Bible]] or from [[Paradise Lost]]. Each night, the family says that a family member would remain awake with David through sometime 30 minute long rapid spasms and convulsions.<ref name="people"/> The Warrens claim that three "lesser exorcisms" took place, the first with four priests in attendance, and that when asked how many demons where inside him, David listed 43 names.<ref name="people"/> She also claims David had marks all over his body, [[levitate|levitated]], and demonstrated the supernatural ability of [[precognition]] relating to the murder Johnson would later commit.<ref name="recordjournal"/>

While staying with Debbie's family, Johnson supposedly taunted the demons said to be within David to possess his own body while participating in David's exorcisms.<ref name="people"/><ref name="danbury"/> As David's condition worsened, Debbie and Johnson moved out; Debbie was hired by Alan Bono, a new resident of the town, as a dog groomer at the Brookfield Pet Motel, and given an nearby apartment to stay at. It was then that Johnson's behavior supposedly began to change, and made Debbie fear that he had become possessed as well. According to Debbie, Johnson would go into a kind of [[trance]], where he would growl, and say he saw a beast, but later have no memory of it.<ref name="people"/>

On February 16th, 1981, Johnson called in sick to his job at Wright Tree Service, claiming he had a sore throat.<ref name="post">{{cite journal|date=[[1981-09-13]]|author=Lynn Darling|title=By Demons Possessed|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=August 18|accessyear=2008}}</ref> He joined his girlfriend Debbie at the animal clinic where she worked along with her sister and cousin.
