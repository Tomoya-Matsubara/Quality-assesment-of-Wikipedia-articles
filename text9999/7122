The following is a '''list of [[Governor]]s of the [[U.S. state|State]] of [[Arkansas]]''' and [[Arkansas Territory]]. The Governor of Arkansas is the chief executive of the state, and [[commander-in-chief]] of its military forces. To be governor, one must be at least 30 years old, a citizen of the [[United States]], and have been a resident of the state for seven years. The governor has the power to veto bills passed by the legislature and to grant pardons in all cases, except for treason and impeachment.

The first [[Arkansas Constitution|state constitution]], ratified in 1836, established four-year terms for governors and the requirement that they be residents of the state for ten years.{{ref|ea2246|[A]}} The fifth constitution in 1874, following the [[American Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction]], limited the executive's power while increasing the legislative's, lowering gubernatorial terms to two years and changed the residency requirement to seven years. Amendment 63 to the Arkansas Constitution, passed in 1984, increased the terms of both governor and lieutenant governor to four years. A referendum in 1992 [[term limit|limited]] the governor to two terms.{{ref|termlimit|[B]}}

Until 1925, should the office of governor be rendered empty through death, resignation, removal, or other disability, the president of the state senate would act as governor, until such time as a new governor were elected or the disability removed, or the acting governor's senate term expired. This led to some situations where the governorship changed hands in quick succession, due to senate terms ending or new presidents of the senate being elected. For example, [[William Kavanaugh Oldham]] served only six days in 1913 before he was replaced as president of the senate. Should the president of the senate be similarly incapacitated, the next in line for the governorship was the speaker of the state house of representatives.

Amendment 6 to the state constitution, passed in 1914 but not recognized until 1925, created the office of lieutenant governor, to be elected at the same time as governor for the same term. In case of removal of the governor, the lieutenant governor now became acting governor.

The current governor is [[Mike Beebe]], who took office on [[January 9]] [[2007]].

Arkansas was part of [[Louisiana Territory]], later renamed [[Missouri Territory]], from 1805 to 1819; see [[List of Governors of Missouri]] for this period.

==List of governors==

===Governors of Arkansas Territory===
[[Arkansas Territory]] (named Arkansaw Territory until around 1822<ref>The territory was formally organized with the name "Arkansaw", but spellings including "Arkansas" and "Arkansa" remained common until around 1822, when the popularity of the ''[[Arkansas Gazette]]'' helped standardize the spelling as "Arkansas".{{ref|ha1822|[C]}}</ref>) was split from [[Missouri Territory]] on [[July 4]] [[1819]].

As secretary of the territory from 1819 to 1829, [[Robert Crittenden]] served as acting governor whenever the appointed governor was not in the state. This meant he was in fact the first person to be governor of Arkansas Territory, since James Miller did not arrive in the territory until nine months after his appointment. Similarly, after George Izard was appointed governor, he did not arrive in the territory for nearly two months, during which Crittenden was again acting governor. He also acted as governor during the times when the territory had no appointed governor.

!#!!Name!!Took office!!Left office!!Party!![[Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas|Lt. Governor]]<ref>The office of lieutenant governor was not created until 1914, and was not filled until 1926. The amendment to the state constitution creating the office was narrowly voted in by the electorate in 1914. The Speaker of the House declared that the measure had lost because it did not receive a majority of the highest vote total from that election. In 1925, it was discovered that a 1910 law amended this requirement such that only a majority of the votes on the specific question was required. Therefore, the 1914 initiative was declared to be valid.{{ref|ltgov|[K]}}</ref>!!Notes
