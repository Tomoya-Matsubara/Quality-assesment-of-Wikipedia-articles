'''Ara Raoul Parseghian''' ({{lang-hy|<U+0531><U+0580><U+0561> <U+054C><U+0561><U+0578><U+0582><U+056C> <U+0532><U+0561><U+0580><U+057D><U+0565><U+0572><U+0575><U+0561><U+0576>}}; born May 21, 1923) is a former [[American football]] player and coach of [[Armenian American|Armenian]] and [[French American|French]] descent who guided the [[University of Notre Dame]] to [[NCAA Division I FBS national football championship|national championships]] in [[1966 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1966]] and [[1973 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1973]]. He is noted for bringing Notre Dame's football program from years of futility back into a national contender in 1964 and is widely regarded alongside [[Knute Rockne]], [[Frank Leahy]] and [[Lou Holtz]] as one of the best coaches in Notre Dame history.<ref name="Weinreb on Ara's legacy">{{cite news|last=Weinreb|first=Michael|title=Blue and Gold and Red All Over|url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7968845/brian-kelly-ara-parseghian-old-glory-messy-future-notre-dame-football|accessdate=July 14, 2013|newspaper=Grantland|date=May 25, 2012}}</ref>

Parseghian grew up in [[Akron, Ohio]] and played football starting in his junior year of high school. He enrolled at the [[University of Akron]], but soon quit to join the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] for two years during [[World War II]]. After the war, he finished his college career at [[Miami University]] in [[Ohio]], and went on to play [[halfback (American football)|halfback]] for the [[Cleveland Browns]] of the [[All-America Football Conference]] in 1948 and 1949. Cleveland won the league championship both of those years.

His playing career cut short by a hip injury, Parseghian left the Browns and took a job as an assistant coach at Miami. When head coach [[Woody Hayes]] left in 1951 to coach at [[Ohio State University]], Parseghian took over his job. He stayed in that position until 1956, when he was hired as head coach at [[Northwestern University]] in [[Illinois]]. In eight seasons there, he amassed a [[winning percentage|win-loss-tie]] record of 36<U+2013>35<U+2013>1 and helped turn a perennial loser into a consistent contender in the national polls. Parseghian's success attracted the interest of the [[University of Notre Dame]], which had not posted a winning record in five straight seasons. He joined as coach in 1964 and quickly turned the program around, coming close to capturing a national championship in his first year. He proceeded to win two national titles in 11 seasons as coach of the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame Fighting Irish]], a period often referred to as "the Era of Ara". He never had a losing season at Notre Dame and posted an overall record of 95<U+2013>17<U+2013>4, giving him the third-most wins of any coach in school history after Rockne and Holtz.

Parseghian quit coaching in 1974 and began a broadcasting career calling college football games for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[CBS]]. He also dedicated himself to medical causes later in life after his daughter was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]] and three of his grandchildren died of a rare genetic disease. Parseghian was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] as a coach in 1980. His career coaching record is 170<U+2013>58<U+2013>6.

==Early life and high school==

Parseghian was the youngest of three children born to an [[Armenians|Armenian]] father and a [[French people|French]] mother in [[Akron, Ohio]].{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=89}} His father, Michael, had come to the [[United States]] from [[Turkey]] in 1915, fleeing the [[Armenian Genocide]] during [[World War I]] and settling in part of the country where there was a large Armenian population.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=89}} Despite his mother's protectiveness, Parseghian became involved in sports from an early age, and developed a reputation as the toughest kid in his class.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=90}} He was hired by Akron's Board of Education in the eighth grade to patrol his school's grounds at night to deter vandals.{{sfn|Dent|2009|pp=90<U+2013>91}}

Parseghian played basketball at the local [[YMCA]], but did not play organized football until his junior year at [[South High School (Akron, Ohio)|South High School]] in Akron because his mother would not allow him to participate in contact sports.<ref name="SI article, 1959">{{cite journal|last=Furlong|first=William Barry|title='It's A Naturalness.

==College and professional career==

After graduating in 1942, Parseghian enrolled at the [[University of Akron]].{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=91}}<ref name="Parseghian at Indiana HOF">{{cite web|title=Parseghian, Ara|url=http://www.indiana-football.org/?q=node/548|publisher=Indiana Football Hall of Fame|accessdate=July 6, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HucVYV2E|archivedate=July 6, 2013}}</ref> American involvement in [[World War II]] had intensified after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, however, and he quit school to join the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]].<ref name="SI article, 1959" />{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=91}} The Navy transferred him for training to [[Naval Station Great Lakes]] near [[Chicago]], where [[Paul Brown]] was coaching a service football team.{{sfn|Dent|2009|pp=91<U+2013>92}} Brown was a well-known high school coach in Ohio, having led his [[Massillon Washington High School]] teams to a series of state championships.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=92}} Parseghian was named the team's starting [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] before the 1944 season, but he was sidelined with an ankle injury and did not play in any games as Great Lakes amassed a 9<U+2013>2<U+2013>1 [[winning percentage|win-loss-tie record]] and was ranked 17th in the nation in the [[AP Poll]].<ref name="SI article, 1959" />{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=92}} Parseghian later said that despite not playing, watching Brown's methodical and strict coaching methods <U+2013> and the ease with which he commanded players much larger than he was <U+2013> was a "priceless" experience.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=92}}

After his military service, Parseghian enrolled at [[Miami University]] in Ohio and played [[halfback (American football)|halfback]] on the school's football team in 1946 and 1947 under coach [[Sid Gillman]].{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=92}} As with Brown, Parseghian paid close attention to  Gillman, a post-war football pioneer who helped popularize deep downfield passes as the [[T formation]] came into vogue.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=92}} He was named an All-Ohio halfback and a Little [[All-America]]n by sportswriters in 1947.<ref name="Northwestern profile">{{cite web|title=Ara R.

Parseghian played halfback and [[defensive back]] for the Browns starting in 1948.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=107}} While he only started one game that season, he was part of a potent offensive backfield that featured [[quarterback]] [[Otto Graham]] and fullback [[Marion Motley]].{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=107<U+2013>110}} The Browns won all of their games and a third straight AAFC championship in 1948.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=118<U+2013>119}} Parseghian suffered a serious injury to his hip in the second game of the 1949 season against the [[Baltimore Colts (AAFC)|Baltimore Colts]], however, ending his playing career.<ref name="SI article, 1959" />{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=93}} He stayed with the Browns for the rest of the season, and the team went on to win another AAFC championship.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=146}} With the Browns he had 44 carries for 166 yards, three receptions for 33 yards, scored two touchdowns, and intercepted one pass.<ref name="Parseghian on PFR" />

==Coaching career==

===Miami University===

While his injury and the end of his professional career were a source of frustration, Parseghian soon got the chance to try coaching instead.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=94}} [[Woody Hayes]], the head coach back at Miami, contacted him about a job as coach of the freshman team.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=94}} He was recommended for the position by athletic director [[John Brickels]], who had been an assistant coach with the Browns in 1948.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=94}} Parseghian led the freshmen to a 4<U+2013>0 record in the 1950 season, and was chosen the following year as Hayes's successor when Hayes departed to become head coach at [[Ohio State University]].<ref name="SI article, 1959" />

Parseghian's teams at Miami consistently did well in the [[Mid-American Conference]], posting a 7<U+2013>3 record in 1951 and improving to 8<U+2013>1 the following year.<ref name="Parseghian all-time coaching records">{{cite web|title=Ara R.

===Northwestern===

When Parseghian arrived at Northwestern, its football program was in transition. [[Bob Voigts]] had quit as head coach in February 1955, leaving his assistant [[Lou Saban]] to guide the team.<ref name="Parseghian hired at Northwestern" /> Under Saban, a former Browns teammate of Parseghian's, Northwestern finished at 0<U+2013>8<U+2013>1, the worst-ever record in its history at the time.<ref name="SI article, 1959" /><ref name="Parseghian hired at Northwestern" /><ref name="Northwestern bio">{{cite web|title=A History of Football At Northwestern: Ara Parseghian: 1956-1963|url=http://exhibits.library.northwestern.edu/archives/exhibits/football/7.html|publisher=Northwestern University|accessdate=July 8, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HxjmfwH7|archivedate=July 8, 2013}}</ref> Ted Payseur, the school's athletic director, resigned after the season under pressure from alumni and was replaced by [[Stu Holcomb]].<ref name="SI article, 1959" /> One of Holcomb's first moves was to fire Saban and replace him with Parseghian.<ref name="Parseghian hired at Northwestern" />

Parseghian was the 20th head coach of the [[Northwestern Wildcats football]] team, and was the youngest coach in the Big Ten when he took the job at 32 years old.<ref name="Parseghian hired at Northwestern" /> His Northwestern career began in 1956 with just one win in his first six games.<ref name="SI article, 1959" /> The Wildcats put together three wins at the end of the season, however, and finished with a 4<U+2013>4<U+2013>1 record.<ref name="Northwestern results, 1955-1959">{{cite web|title=Northwestern Yearly Results|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/bigten/northwestern/1955-1959_yearly_results.php|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|accessdate=July 8, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HxjjiwuY|archivedate=July 8, 2013}}</ref> Northwestern proceeded to lose all nine of its games in the 1957 season.<ref name="Northwestern results, 1955-1959" /> The string of losses was a low point for Parseghian, although many of the games were close, and the team improved the following year.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=70}} Northwestern finished the 1958 season with a 5<U+2013>4 record that included victories over conference rivals [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] and [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]].{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|pp=70<U+2013>71}}

Northwestern began the 1959 season in the top ten in the [[AP Poll]], and began with a 45<U+2013>13 win over [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]], then the top-ranked team in the country.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=71}} It was the first of a string of victories that propelled Northwestern to the number-two spot in the AP Poll.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=71}} Led by [[quarterback]] John Talley and star halfback [[Ron Burton]], the team beat Michigan again and won a match-up in October against [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]], a school Northwestern had not played since 1948.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=71}} Three straight losses at the end of the season ended the team's run at the conference championship, however.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=71}}

The following four seasons brought a mix of success and challenges. Parseghian's best year at Northwestern was in 1962, when the team finished at 7<U+2013>2.<ref name="Northwestern results, 1960-1964">{{cite web|title=Northwestern Yearly Results|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/bigten/northwestern/1960-1964_yearly_results.php|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|accessdate=July 8, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HxkJ84yd|archivedate=July 8, 2013}}</ref> Parseghian was a shrewd recruiter, using Northwestern's small budget to find versatile players overlooked by the bigger rival programs.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=71}} In 1962, he put his faith in sophomore quarterback [[Tom Myers (quarterback)|Tom Myers]] to guide the team.<ref name="SI on Myers">{{cite journal|last=Creamer|first=Robert|title=Ara Parseghian's Gamble|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=November 5, 1962|page=29|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1147960/index.htm|accessdate=July 11, 2013}}</ref> Myers, aided by a big offensive line and by star receiver [[Paul Flatley]], led a passing attack that helped Northwestern to the top of the AP Poll in the middle of the season following wins against Ohio State and Notre Dame.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=72}} Parseghian called the close win against Hayes and Ohio State "one of Northwestern's greatest victories".{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=73}} The following week's Notre Dame game drew a 55,752 people, which remained the largest crowd ever to see a home game at Northwestern as of 2005.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=73}} Despite those wins, late-season losses to [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] and [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin]] cost the team a chance at the Big Ten championship.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=71}}

At Northwestern, Parseghian developed a reputation as an affable, down-to-earth coach. While he took his job seriously, he cultivated an informal rapport with players, who called him "Ara" rather than "coach" or "Mr. Parseghian".<ref name="SI article, 1959" /> Given his closeness in age to many of the players, he "empathizes with us well", Northwestern tackle [[Andy Cvercko]] said in 1959.<ref name="SI article, 1959" /> Parseghian occasionally joined in practices with the players and organized games of touch football.<ref name="SI article, 1959" /> He had other quirks, like lowering the intensity of practices as game day approached to let the players "build up psychologically", something he learned from Paul Brown.<ref name="SI article, 1959" />

Parseghian remained at Northwestern for eight seasons, until 1963.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=73}} His career coaching record there was 36<U+2013>35<U+2013>1.<ref name="Northwestern coaching records">{{cite web|title=Northwestern Coaching Records|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/bigten/northwestern/coaching_records.php|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|accessdate=July 11, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6I2BqblLe|archivedate=July 11, 2013}}</ref> This ranks him third at Northwestern in total wins and ninth at Northwestern in winning percentage.<ref name="Northwestern coaching records" /> Parseghian's teams beat Notre Dame four straight times after their annual series was renewed in 1959 following a decade-long hiatus.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|pp=71<U+2013>73}}

Toward the end of his tenure at Northwestern, Parseghian grew frustrated by the school's limited financial resources, curbs on football scholarships and academic standards for athletes that were more stringent than at other Big Ten schools.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=66}} He also clashed with Holcomb, the athletic director, who told him in 1963 that his contract would not be renewed after that season despite coaching the team to within two wins of a national championship the previous year.{{sfn|Dent|2009|pp=69<U+2013>70}} "I took them to the top of the polls in 1962, and that was not good enough for Northwestern", Parseghian said many years later.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=70}}

===Notre Dame===

As the end of his Northwestern career approached in November 1963, Parseghian called Father Edmund Joyce, the vice president and chairman of the athletics board at Notre Dame, a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] university near [[South Bend, Indiana]].{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=70}} He asked whether [[Hugh Devore]], who was then interim head football coach, was going to be given the job on a longer-term basis.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=70}} When Joyce said the university was searching for a new coach, Parseghian expressed interest in the job.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=70}} Joyce did not immediately seem warm to the idea, however, and Parseghian explored an offer to coach at the [[University of Miami]], where his old friend [[Andy Gustafson]] had been promoted from head coach to athletic director.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=71}} Notre Dame was also considering [[Dan Devine]] for its coaching job, but ultimately offered it to Parseghian.{{sfn|Dent|2009|pp=75<U+2013>76}} Parseghian waffled at first, recalling his father's dislike of Catholics who had played a role in the [[Armenian deportations]], but accepted in December and was given a salary of about $20,000 a year (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|20000|1963}}}} today).{{sfn|Dent|2009|pp=79<U+2013>80}}

Parseghian's candidacy for the head coaching job at Notre Dame was unusual because he was not a Notre Dame graduate, as every head coach since [[Knute Rockne]] had been.<ref name="Parseghian Tribune article">{{cite news|last=Hamilton|first=Brian|title=Notre Dame legend: Ara Parseghian|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-02/sports/ct-spt-0103-parseghian-notre-dame-legends--20130103_1_notre-dame-stadium-ara-parseghian-legend|accessdate=July 12, 2013|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=January 2, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6I38jzXVq|archivedate=July 12, 2013}}</ref> Parseghian was also an Armenian [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], making him the first non-Catholic coach since Rockne, who converted in 1925.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=70}}<ref name="Parseghian hired at ND, AP">{{cite news|title=New Era Is Underway At Notre Dame|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=110&dat=19631219&id=mGVPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SU8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3785,5347308|accessdate=July 13, 2013|newspaper=Ludington Daily News|date=December 19, 1963|agency=Associated Press|location=South Bend, Ind.|page=8}}</ref> Joyce made it clear before his hiring that he did not care about Parseghian's religion, but simply wanted someone who could lead the football team to success.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=82}}

As had been the case at Northwestern, Notre Dame's football program was in a state of flux when Parseghian arrived. While Notre Dame built a proud history under Rockne and [[Frank Leahy]], its two most successful coaches, the late 1950s and early 1960s had been a disaster.{{sfn|Dent|2009|pp=18<U+2013>22}} The team had finished 5<U+2013>5 in 1962 under [[Joe Kuharich]], who lost the confidence of his players and Notre Dame's administrators during his four years as coach.{{sfn|Dent|2009|pp=22<U+2013>25}} Kuharich's surprise departure at the end of that season to become supervisor of officials in the [[National Football League]], a position created by his friend and NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]], left the program in disarray.{{sfn|Dent|2009|pp=25<U+2013>26}} Devore, a long-time Notre Dame employee who had played for Rockne and coached under Leahy, was brought in to lead the team on an interim basis in 1963.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=39}} Notre Dame managed only a 2<U+2013>7 finish that year.<ref name="Notre Dame results, 1960-1964">{{cite web|title=Notre Dame Yearly Results|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/independents/notre_dame/1960-1964_yearly_results.php|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}</ref>

====Turnaround and the 1964 season====

Parseghian quickly turned things around in 1964, reestablishing a sense of confidence and team spirit that had been lost under Kuharich and Devore.{{sfn|Dent|2009|pp=83<U+2013>84}} Practices were carefully planned and organized with the help of a coaching staff that consisted of three assistants from Northwestern and four former Notre Dame players.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=96}} Parseghian listened to players' concerns about the program and addressed them.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=87}} He updated the team's offense by favoring passing and bringing in smaller and quicker players.{{sfn|Dent|2009|pp=98<U+2013>99}} A rule change allowing unlimited substitutions starting in 1964 helped make this strategy successful; fast-running receivers could now be taken out of the game and rested as others replaced them.{{sfn|Dent|2009|pp=97<U+2013>98}}

Parseghian also recognized talent in [[quarterback]] [[John Huarte]] and [[End (American football)|end]] [[Jack Snow (American football)|Jack Snow]], who had been used only sparingly for two seasons by previous coaches.{{sfn|Dent|2009|pp=100<U+2013>102}} Huarte could throw far and accurately but was soft-spoken, a trait Parseghian and his staff helped change.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=108}} Snow was large for a receiver of his era, but Parseghian thought his athleticism and sure hands would make him a good wideout.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=102}} Still, expectations were muted for the 1964 season: Parseghian told his coaches that the team would have a 6<U+2013>4 record if they were lucky.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=125}} ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' predicted a 5<U+2013>5 record at best, and the team did not rank among the top 20 programs in the country in the pre-season AP Poll.{{sfn|Dent|2009|pp=155, 159}}

Notre Dame nonetheless opened the season with a 31<U+2013>7 victory over the heavily favored Wisconsin, a game in which Huarte threw for more yards than the team's leading passer had over the entire 1963 season.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=182}} Notre Dame players carried Parseghian off the field after the win, which vaulted the team to ninth place in the polls.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=182}} A string of victories followed, first against [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue]] and then [[Air Force Falcons football|Air Force]] and  [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]].{{sfn|Dent|2009|pp=197, 209, 215}} Notre Dame rose to first place in the national polls following a 40<U+2013>0 win over [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy]] in October.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=237}} The team went undefeated until the last game of the year against [[USC Trojans Football|USC]], who won 20<U+2013>17 in the final minutes on a touchdown pass from [[Craig Fertig]] to [[Rod Sherman]].{{sfn|Dent|2009|pp=271<U+2013>273}} The loss unseated Notre Dame from the top ranking in the national polls, but the team still won the [[MacArthur Bowl|MacArthur Trophy]], a championship awarded by the [[National Football Foundation]].{{sfn|Dent|2009|pp=279<U+2013>280}}

Huarte passed for 2,062 yards and set 12 school records in 1964, four of which still stood as of 2009.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=283}} He also won the [[Heisman Trophy]].{{sfn|Dent|2009|pp=254<U+2013>256}} Snow led the country in receptions, with 60.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=283}} Parseghian, meanwhile, won numerous coach of the year awards for engineering the turnaround, including from the [[AFCA Coach of the Year|American Football Coaches Association]], the [[Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year|Football Writers Association of America]], the Washington Touchdown Club, the Columbus Touchdown Club and ''[[College Football News|Football News]]''.<ref name="Parseghian at Indiana HOF" /><ref name="Football News COY 1964">{{cite news|title=Ara, Huarte Are Honored|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=41UaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iycEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2875,2609625&dq=parseghian+coach+of+the+year+football-news&hl=en|accessdate=July 14, 2013|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=November 24, 1964|agency=Journal Wire Services|page=10}}</ref>

Huarte and Snow graduated after the 1964 season, and Notre Dame felt their absence the following year, posting a 7<U+2013>2<U+2013>1 record.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=286}} While the team did not contend for a national title, [[defensive back]] [[Nick Rassas]] led the nation in [[punt (gridiron football)|punt]] returns and came in sixth in [[interception]]s; he was named a first-team [[All-America]]n by sportswriters.{{sfn|Dent|2009|p=286}}
