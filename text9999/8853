In the [[North American Numbering Plan]], '''828''' is the telephone [[area code]] for the western mountain region of the [[U.S. state]] of [[North Carolina]], including [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]]. The city of [[Hickory, North Carolina|Hickory]] is often grouped with the [[Charlotte metropolitan area]], but uses 828 rather than Charlotte's 704/980 [[area code overlay]]. 828 was carved from the [[Area code 704|704 area code]] in 1998 to free up numbers because of the popularity of pagers and cell phones.
