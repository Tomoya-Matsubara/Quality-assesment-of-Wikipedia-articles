'''Mladen Stojanovi<U+0107>''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|<U+041C><U+043B><U+0430><U+0434><U+0435><U+043D> <U+0421><U+0442><U+043E><U+0458><U+0430><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+045B>}}; 7&nbsp;April 1896 <U+2013> 1&nbsp;April 1942) was a [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serb]] [[physician]] who led a detachment of [[Yugoslav Partisans]] in the area of [[Kozara]] in north-western [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] on the [[Yugoslav Front]] of [[World War II]]. He was posthumously proclaimed a [[People's Hero of Yugoslavia]]. At the age of fifteen, Stojanovi<U+0107> became an activist in a group of student organizations called [[Young Bosnia]], which strongly opposed [[Austria-Hungary]]'s rule over [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in Austria-Hungary|Bosnia-Herzegovina]]. In 1912, Stojanovi<U+0107> was inducted into ''[[Narodna Odbrana]]'', an association founded in the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] with the aim of organizing a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] resistance to the [[Annexation Crisis|annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina]] by Austria-Hungary. Stojanovi<U+0107> was arrested by the Austrian police in July 1914, and although he was sentenced to 16 years' imprisonment, he was pardoned in 1917. He graduated as a [[Doctor of Medicine]] after World War I, and in 1929 commenced a private practice in Prijedor. He became a member of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (KPJ) in September 1940.

After the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] by the [[Axis powers]] and their creation of the [[Independent State of Croatia]], Stojanovi<U+0107> was imprisoned in June 1941 by the [[Usta<U+0161>e]]<U+2014>the [[Fascism|fascist]] government of the puppet state. He escaped from prison and went to Mount Kozara, where he joined communists who had escaped from Prijedor. The KPJ chose Stojanovi<U+0107> to lead the uprising in the district of Prijedor{{mdash}}part of the area of Kozara. The uprising began on 30&nbsp;July 1941 although neither Stojanovi<U+0107> nor any other communists had much control over it at this stage. The Serb villagers of the district seized control of a number of villages and threatened Prijedor, which was defended by German, Usta<U+0161>e, and [[Croatian Home Guard (Independent State of Croatia)|Croatian Home Guard]] forces. In August 1941, Stojanovi<U+0107> was recognised as the principal leader of the insurgents in Kozara, who were then organised into Partisan military units. Under Stojanovi<U+0107>'s direction, the Kozara Partisans began attacking the enemy from the end of September 1941. At the beginning of November 1941, all Partisan units in Kozara were merged into the 2nd Krajina National Liberation Partisan Detachment, commanded by Stojanovi<U+0107>. By the end of 1941, most of Kozara{{mdash}}covering about 2,500 square kilometres{{mdash}}was controlled by Stojanovi<U+0107>'s detachment.

On 30&nbsp;December 1941, Stojanovi<U+0107> arrived in the [[Grme<U+010D>]] district, which was in the zone of responsibility of the 1st Krajina National Liberation Partisan Detachment. The Italian troops operating in that area portrayed themselves as protectors of the Serbian people. Stojanovi<U+0107>'s tasks were to counter the Italian propaganda and to mobilise the Partisans of the 1st Krajina Detachment to fight against them. He stayed in the area until mid-February 1942, by which time the Partisan leadership of Bosnia-Herzegovina considered he had completed his tasks successfully. At the end of February 1942, Stojanovi<U+0107> was appointed chief of staff of the Operational Headquarters for Bosanska Krajina<U+2014>a unified command of all Partisan forces in the regions of [[Bosanska Krajina]] and central Bosnia. The Operational Headquarters' main task was to counter the rising influence of the [[Serbian nationalism|Serb-nationalist]] [[Chetniks]] in those regions. On 5&nbsp;March 1942, Stojanovi<U+0107> was severely wounded in a Chetnik ambush. He was taken to a field hospital in the village of [[Jo<U+0161>avka Gornja|Jo<U+0161>avka]]. Members of the Jo<U+0161>avka Partisan Company defected to the Chetniks on the night of 31&nbsp;March, and took Stojanovi<U+0107> prisoner. The next night, a group of Chetniks killed him. In April 1942, the 2nd Krajina Detachment was named "Mladen Stojanovi<U+0107>" in his honour, and he was proclaimed a People's Hero of Yugoslavia a few months later. After the war, his service to the Partisan cause was commemorated by the construction of a memorial in Prijedor, the naming of streets, public buildings and a park after him, in song and in film.

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Prijedor 1910.jpg|thumb|Stojanovi<U+0107>'s home town of [[Prijedor]] around 1910]]

Stojanovi<U+0107> was the third child and the first son of [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] priest Simo Stojanovi<U+0107> and his wife Jovanka. He was born in Prijedor on 7&nbsp;April 1896. Bosnia-Herzegovina was then [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in Austria-Hungary|occupied by Austria-Hungary]]; Prijedor was located in [[Bosanska Krajina]], the north-western region of the province.<ref name=bas9>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 9<U+2013>12</ref> Stojanovi<U+0107>'s father was the third generation of his family to serve as a Serbian Orthodox priest. He had graduated from a theology faculty, becoming the first in the family to attain a higher level of education. Simo was active in the political struggle for ecclesiastical and educational autonomy for the [[Serbs]] in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Mladen Stojanovi<U+0107>'s maternal grandfather was a Serbian Orthodox priest from [[Dubica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Dubica]].<ref>[[#Adamovic 2010|Adamovi<U+0107> 2010]], para. 2<U+2013>5</ref>

Stojanovi<U+0107> completed his elementary education at the Serbian Elementary School in Prijedor in 1906. In 1907, he finished the first grade of his secondary education at the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Sarajevo]], before he entered the gymnasium in [[Tuzla]], where he would complete the remaining seven grades. His brother [[Sreten Stojanovi<U+0107>]]{{mdash}}who would become a prominent sculptor{{mdash}}joined him at the [[Gimnazija Me<U+0161>a Selimovi<U+0107>|Tuzla gymnasium]] in 1908.<ref name=bas9/>

===Activist of Young Bosnia===

Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina on 6&nbsp;October 1908, which caused the [[Annexation Crisis]] in Europe. The [[Kingdom of Serbia]] protested and mobilised its army, but then on 31&nbsp;March 1909, it formally accepted the annexation.<ref>[[#Dedijer 1966|Dedijer 1966]], p. 626</ref> In 1911, Mladen Stojanovi<U+0107> became a member of the secret association of students of the Tuzla gymnasium called ''Narodno Jedinstvo'' (National Unity); its members described it as a youth society of nationalists.<ref name=bas20>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 20<U+2013>25</ref><ref name=ded580>[[#Dedijer 1966|Dedijer 1966]], pp. 580<U+2013>83</ref> It was one of a group of diverse student organisations later called [[Young Bosnia]], which strongly opposed Austria-Hungary's rule over Bosnia-Herzegovina.<ref>[[#Donia 2006|Donia 2006]], p. 112</ref> The activists of Young Bosnia were [[Bosnian Serbs]], [[Bosnian Muslims|Muslims]], and [[Bosnian Croats|Croats]], though most were Serbs.<ref>[[#Dedijer 1966|Dedijer 1966]], p. 353</ref> The first organisation regarded to be part of this group was established in 1904 by Serb students of the gymnasium in [[Mostar]].<ref name=ded293>[[#Dedijer 1966|Dedijer 1966]], pp. 293<U+2013>98</ref>

[[File:Tuzla Stara Gimnazija.jpg|thumb|The [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Tuzla]], which Stojanovi<U+0107> attended from 1907 to 1914]]

Young Bosnia's activists regarded literature as indispensable to revolution, and most of them wrote poems, short stories, or critiques.<ref>[[#Dedijer 1966|Dedijer 1966]], pp. 386<U+2013>88</ref> Stojanovi<U+0107> wrote poems,<ref name=bas180>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 180<U+2013>82</ref> and read the works of [[Petar Ko<U+010D>i<U+0107>]], [[Aleksa <U+0160>anti<U+0107>]], [[Vladislav Petkovi<U+0107> Dis]], [[Sima Pandurovi<U+0107>]], [[Milan Raki<U+0107>]], and later the works of [[Russian literature|Russian authors]].<ref name=bas15>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 15<U+2013>16</ref> In his final years at the gymnasium, he read [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Rousseau]], [[Bakunin]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Jean Jaur<U+00E8>s|Jaur<U+00E8>s]], [[Gustave Le Bon|Le Bon]], [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]], and [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Marinetti]].<ref>[[#Calic 2010|Calic 2010]], p. 64</ref> National Unity held meetings at which its members presented lectures and discussed current issues concerning the Serbian people of Bosnia-Herzegovina.<ref name=bas15/> All members of the association were Serbs.<ref name=bas20/> Generally, Stojanovi<U+0107>'s lectures were about educating people on practical issues of health and the economy. During the summer break of 1911, Stojanovi<U+0107> travelled across Bosanska Krajina lecturing in villages.<ref>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 26<U+2013>30</ref> One of the aims of Young Bosnia was to eliminate the backwardness of their country.<ref name=ded293/>

In early-to-mid 1912, Stojanovi<U+0107> and his schoolmate Todor Ili<U+0107> joined ''[[Narodna Odbrana]]'' (National Defence),<ref name=bas20/> an association founded in Serbia in December 1908 on the initiative of [[Branislav Nu<U+0161>i<U+0107>]]. It aimed to organise a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] resistance to the Austrian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and to spread nationalist propaganda. National Defence soon established a network of local committees throughout Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Its members from the latter territory gathered intelligence on the Austrian army and passed it to the Serbian secret service.<ref>[[#Dedijer 1966|Dedijer 1966]], pp. 636<U+2013>39</ref>

Stojanovi<U+0107> and Ili<U+0107> travelled illegally to Serbia during the summer break of 1912 to receive military training that National Defence organised for its members. They stayed for several days in [[Belgrade]], the capital of Serbia, where they met [[Gavrilo Princip]], another activist of Young Bosnia who was also a member of National Defence. Stojanovi<U+0107> and Ili<U+0107> then spent a month at army barracks in [[Vranje]] in southern Serbia, undergoing military training under the command of [[Vojin Popovi<U+0107>]], a famous [[Chetnik]] guerrilla fighter. When they returned to school, they resumed their activities with National Unity. Its members decided that Muslims should also be drawn into the association. After [[Trifko Grabe<U+017E>]] was expelled from the Tuzla gymnasium for slapping a teacher during a quarrel, the association organised a school strike. Most of the students who participated were Serbs; the strike gained little support among students of other ethnicities. The school took disciplinary measures against Ili<U+0107> and Stojanovi<U+0107>, who were regarded as the main organisers of the strike, and Ili<U+0107> lost his scholarship.<ref name=bas20/>

In the autumn of 1913, Stojanovi<U+0107> commenced the final year of his secondary education. National Unity was visited that year by a group of activists of Young Bosnia who were university students in [[Prague]], [[Vienna]], and [[Switzerland]]. They held a series of lectures for the members of the association, explaining their views on the current political situation, and promoting the unity of [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] peoples in their struggle to liberate themselves from Austria-Hungary. These lectures influenced Stojanovi<U+0107> to adopt a [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslavist]] stance. At the beginning of 1914, Ili<U+0107> and Stojanovi<U+0107> became, respectively, the president and the vice-president of National Unity, which numbered 34 members, including four Muslims and four Croats.<ref name=bas36>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 36<U+2013>40</ref> At that time, National Unity was one of the most active groups of Young Bosnia.<ref>[[#Dedijer 1966|Dedijer 1966]], p. 512</ref>

According to Vid Gakovi<U+0107>, who was a member of National Unity in 1914, Stojanovi<U+0107> was an ambitious and talented young man. He was determined that his voice would be heard and he liked being the centre of attention. He was severe to younger members of the association, whom he sometimes sharply criticised. Nevertheless, younger students liked being around him. Gakovi<U+0107> described him as a tall and handsome man who greatly cared about his appearance; he wore a bow tie and a broad-brimmed hat.<ref name=bas49>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 49<U+2013>52</ref>

On the morning of 28&nbsp;June 1914, in Sarajevo, Princip [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated]] [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]]{{mdash}}[[heir presumptive]] to the throne of Austria-Hungary{{mdash}}and [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|his wife]].<ref>[[#Dedijer 1966|Dedijer 1966]], pp. 31<U+2013>32</ref> Princip was a member of a group of conspirators, which included Trifko Grabe<U+017E>; the whole group was arrested by the Austrian police after the assassination.<ref>[[#Dedijer 1966|Dedijer 1966]], p. 593</ref> Blaming Serbia for the attack, Austria-Hungary declared war a month later, initiating [[World War I]].<ref>[[#Dedijer 1966|Dedijer 1966]], pp. 35<U+2013>37</ref> Shortly after the assassination, Stojanovi<U+0107> wrote in his notebook a quote from [[Giuseppe Mazzini]]: "There is no more sacred thing in the world than the duty of a conspirator, who becomes an avenger of humanity and the apostle of permanent natural laws."<ref name=ded293/> On 29&nbsp;June, Stojanovi<U+0107> took his [[Abitur|final exams]] at the Tuzla gymnasium. Soon afterwards, he and Ili<U+0107> wrote a draft of their manifesto to South Slavic youth,<ref name=bas36/> referring to Young Bosnia in a sentence:<ref name=ded580/>

Vojislav Vasiljevi<U+0107>, a close friend of Princip's, was a member of National Unity, and when the Austrian police searched his notebooks they found a list of members. Vasiljevi<U+0107> kept this information as evidence of the payment of membership fees.<ref name=ded580/> All those on the list, including Stojanovi<U+0107>, were arrested on 3&nbsp;July 1914.<ref name=bas36/> Soon after, Stojanovi<U+0107>'s younger brother Sreten was arrested for anti-Austrian revolutionary correspondence between himself and Ili<U+0107>.<ref name=bas49/> Beside the conspirators behind the assassination, six groups of activists of Young Bosnia were arrested.<ref name=ded580/> The group containing the members of National Unity was called the Tuzla group. The criminal investigation against them began on 9&nbsp;July, and lasted for more than a year.<ref name=bas36/> They were kept in prisons in Tuzla, [[Banja Luka]], and [[Biha<U+0107>]]. In the Banja Luka prison, they were all kept in the same room, enabling them to organise political and literary discussions. They issued a comic and satirical magazine, called "Mala paprika" (Little Paprika), the copies of which they made using [[carbon paper]]. A number of copies found their way out of the prison.<ref name=bas49/>

In the Biha<U+0107> prison, the Tuzla group created a literary magazine named "Almanah" (Almanac). In its first and only issue, Mladen contributed several poems and an essay. Its editor-in-chief was Ili<U+0107>, while Sreten Stojanovi<U+0107> and [[Kosta Hakman]] contributed illustrations. The Stojanovi<U+0107> brothers and Ili<U+0107> learned French during their incarceration.<ref name=bas49/> The trial of the Tuzla group was held between 13 and 30&nbsp;September 1915 in Biha<U+0107>. Ili<U+0107> was sentenced to death, Mladen to sixteen years' imprisonment, and the other members of the group received sentences between ten months and fifteen years.<ref name=ded580/> Especially aggravating for Ili<U+0107> and Mladen was their participation in the 1912 military training in Serbia. The Austrians became aware of this because their army temporarily took [[Loznica]] in western Serbia at the beginning of [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|World War I]], and there they found National Defence documents containing records of all Bosnians that attended the training.<ref name=bas36/>

Mladen and other members of the Tuzla group were sent to the prison in [[Zenica]]. Three months after they were sentenced they were joined by Ili<U+0107>, whose death penalty had been commuted to 20 years' imprisonment. In the [[Zenica prison]], each convict had to spend the first three months in [[solitary confinement]]. This was very hard on Mladen, who became mentally unwell and became so emaciated that Ili<U+0107> could hardly recognise him. He recovered and took a course in shoe-making which was given in the prison. Afterwards, he fell seriously ill and had to undergo surgery in the prison hospital.<ref name=bas61>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 61<U+2013>65</ref> In late 1917, the Austrian authorities pardoned all convicts of the Tuzla group except Ili<U+0107>. Mladen went to his family in Prijedor. After a medical examination, he was declared unfit for army service due to his surgery and as a result was not drafted into the Austrian army. He entered the [[School of Medicine, University of Zagreb]], shortly before the disintegration of Austria-Hungary in November 1918.<ref name=bas61/>

===Interwar period===
The [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]{{mdash}}renamed Yugoslavia in 1929{{mdash}}was created on 1&nbsp;December 1918, and incorporated Bosnia-Herzegovina.<ref>[[#Tomasevich 2001|Tomasevich 2001]], p. 1</ref> Stojanovi<U+0107> continued studying medicine in [[Zagreb]]. As a former activist of Young Bosnia, he was offered a King's scholarship but he refused it. In Zagreb, he reunited with his former schoolmate Nikola Nikoli<U+0107>, who had also been a member of National Unity. After his release from the Zenica prison, Nikoli<U+0107> was drafted into the Austrian army and sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Russian front]] where he surrendered to the Russians and participated in the [[October Revolution]]. Nikoli<U+0107>'s account of the revolution influenced Stojanovi<U+0107> to adopt a more [[leftist]] stance. During this period, Stojanovi<U+0107>'s favourite authors were [[Maksim Gorky]] and [[Miroslav Krle<U+017E>a]]. His professor of anatomy, Drago Perovi<U+0107>, arranged for him to visit an anatomical institute in Vienna. Stojanovi<U+0107> went there several times in 1921 and 1922 and befriended members of a leftist association of Yugoslav students at the Vienna University.<ref name=bas87>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 87<U+2013>89</ref> When they held a protest against the king and government of Yugoslavia, Stojanovi<U+0107> took part and delivered a speech. Behind the protest stood the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (KPJ).<ref name=bas101>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 101<U+2013>2</ref>

Stojanovi<U+0107> graduated as a [[Doctor of Medicine]] in 1926, and he worked for two years as a trainee physician in Zagreb and Sarajevo. He then opened a private practice in [[Pu<U+010D>i<U+0161><U+0107>a]] on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] island of [[Bra<U+010D>]]. In 1929, he returned to Prijedor, where he opened a practice on the first floor of the Stojanovi<U+0107> family house, where his mother had lived alone since his father's death in 1926.<ref name=bas107>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 107<U+2013>12</ref><ref>[[#Adamovic 2010|Adamovi<U+0107> 2010]], para. 6</ref> Stojanovi<U+0107> soon became a popular figure in Prijedor; his patients said that simply talking with him was curative. He treated poor people for free; he once sent a homeless man to a hospital in Zagreb and paid for his surgery.<ref name=bas107/> Stojanovi<U+0107> earned well and had a good standard of living.<ref name=bas93>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 93<U+2013>95</ref> People from other areas of Bosanska Krajina also went to him for medical treatment. In villages around Prijedor, where brawls were common, rowdies sang about him:<ref name=bas107/>

In 1931, Stojanovi<U+0107> was contracted to the Prijedor branch of the state railway company to provide healthcare for its employees.<ref name=bas115>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 115<U+2013>18</ref> In 1936, he was contracted to an iron ore mining company in [[Ljubija (town)|Ljubija]], a town near Prijedor, and would visit the mining company clinic twice a week.<ref name=bas67>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 67<U+2013>74</ref> He also taught hygiene at the gymnasium in Prijedor.<ref>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], p. 13</ref> Together with other intellectuals from the town, he gave lectures to the miners at their club in Ljubija. His lectures were usually about medical issues, but he also described the economic and social position of workers in more advanced countries. He socialised with the miners and treated their family members for free.<ref name=bas67/> He was very active socially, and also participated in sports. In 1932, he founded the tennis club of Prijedor, which continues to bear his name.<ref name=bas107/><ref>{{cite web| publisher=Dr Mladen Stojanovi<U+0107> Tennis Club, Prijedor| language=Serbian| title=Istorijat kluba| trans_title=History of the Club| url=http://www.tenis-prijedor.com/tennis/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=59&Itemid=34| archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20111205190949/http://www.tenis-prijedor.com/tennis/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=59&Itemid=34| archivedate=2011-12-05| deadurl=no| separator=.}}</ref> Stojanovi<U+0107> once bought new [[Kit (association football)|kit]] for all members of the [[FK Rudar Prijedor|Rudar Ljubija]] football club.<ref>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], p. 82</ref> His contracts with the railway company and the mining company were both terminated in 1939. The railway employees protested in Prijedor, and Stojanovi<U+0107>'s contract with that company was subsequently renewed.<ref name=bas115/>

The Ljubija miners were on strike between 2&nbsp;August and 8&nbsp;September 1940.<ref name=bas67/> Some of the leaders of the strike were members of a secret KPJ cell in Ljubija, which was formed in January 1940. The KPJ had been outlawed in Yugoslavia since 1921. The KPJ organisation of Banja Luka sent its experienced member Branko Babi<U+010D> to help the strike leaders.<ref name=bas76>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 76<U+2013>80</ref> According to Babi<U+010D>, a communist from Prijedor introduced him to Stojanovi<U+0107> at the beginning of September 1940. Babi<U+010D> stayed for several days at the doctor's house, running the strike. Seeing Stojanovi<U+0107> as a communist sympathiser, Babi<U+010D> proposed that he join the KPJ. Stojanovi<U+0107> at first declined, saying that he still had [[bourgeois]] habits, though he had read much of the [[Marxism|Marxist]] literature. After further conversations with Babi<U+010D>, Stojanovi<U+0107> agreed to become a member of the party.<ref name=bas93/>

At the end of September 1940, Babi<U+010D> and all five members of the Ljubija cell held a meeting at which they unanimously decided to admit Stojanovi<U+0107> into the KPJ.<ref name=bas76/> Babi<U+010D> held him in high esteem and regarded him as ardently devoted to the communist cause.<ref name=bas93/> Some communists, however, continued to refer to Stojanovi<U+0107> as a communist sympathiser,<ref>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], p. 7</ref> and some regarded him as a "salon communist".<ref name=bas93/>

===Onset of World War II===
[[File:Axis occupation of Yugoslavia 1941-43.png|thumb|Partition of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] by the Axis powers]]

On 6&nbsp;April 1941, Yugoslavia was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] from all sides by the [[Axis powers]], led by [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces.<ref name=vuc355>[[#Vucinich 1949|Vucinich 1949]], pp. 355<U+2013>358</ref> Stojanovi<U+0107> was assigned as a physician to an infantry battalion based in Banja Luka. For several days after the invasion this battalion moved toward [[Dalmatia]], before it completely disintegrated without fighting the enemy, and Stojanovi<U+0107> returned to Prijedor.<ref name=bas43>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 43<U+2013>44</ref> The [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] capitulated on 17&nbsp;April, and the Axis powers proceeded to dismember Yugoslavia. Almost all of modern-day [[Croatia]], all of modern-day [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], and parts of modern-day [[Serbia]] were combined into a [[puppet state]] called the [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-hr|Nezavisna Dr<U+017E>ava Hrvatska}}, NDH).<ref name=vuc355/> It was an "Italian-German quasi-protectorate",<ref>[[#Tomasevich 2001|Tomasevich 2001]], p. 272</ref> which was controlled by the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Usta<U+0161>e]] led by [[Ante Paveli<U+0107>]]. One of its policies was to [[World War II persecution of Serbs|eliminate the ethnic Serb population]] of the NDH through mass killings, expulsions and [[forced assimilation]], and many Serbs fled from the NDH to the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|German-occupied territory of Serbia]].<ref name=vuc355/>

These repressive measures included taking prominent Serbs hostage against Serb attacks. To avoid being taken as a hostage, Stojanovi<U+0107> paid 100,000 [[Yugoslav dinar|dinar]]s to the Usta<U+0161>e in Prijedor.<ref name=bas43/> Resistance began to emerge in occupied Yugoslavia; royalists and Serbian nationalists under the leadership of then-Colonel [[Dra<U+017E>a Mihailovi<U+0107>]] founded the Ravna Gora Movement, whose members were called Chetniks.<ref name=vuc362>[[#Vucinich 1949|Vucinich 1949]], pp. 362<U+2013>365</ref><ref name=rob20>[[#Roberts 1987|Roberts 1987]], pp. 20<U+2013>22, 26</ref> The KPJ, led by [[Josip Broz Tito]], prepared to rise to arms at a favourable moment.<ref name=rob23>[[#Roberts 1987|Roberts 1987]], pp. 23<U+2013>24</ref> In the view of the KPJ, the fight against the Axis and its domestic collaborators would be a common fight of all Yugoslav peoples.<ref>[[#Vukmanovic 1982|Vukmanovi<U+0107> 1982]], v. 1, p. 157</ref><ref>[[#Vucinich 1949|Vucinich 1949]], p. 364</ref>

[[Operation Barbarossa]], the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, began on 22&nbsp;June 1941.<ref name=vuk152>[[#Vukmanovic 1982|Vukmanovi<U+0107> 1982]], v. 1, p. 152</ref> On the same day, the Usta<U+0161>e began arresting communists and their known sympathisers in the towns of Bosanska Krajina, including Prijedor. The communists had predicted this, and most of them avoided capture by escaping to the villages or hiding in the towns. Stojanovi<U+0107> was one of the few communists arrested in Prijedor.<ref name=mar85>[[#Marjanovic 1980|Marjanovi<U+0107> 1980]], pp. 85<U+2013>87</ref> He was imprisoned with the Serb hostages on the second floor of a school in the town. They were subjected to forced labour, being led each morning through the town to repair the road to [[Kozarac]]. The column of hostages was usually headed by Stojanovi<U+0107> carrying a shovel on his shoulder.<ref name=bas43/> The [[Croatian Home Guard (Independent State of Croatia)|Croatian Home Guard]]s guarding the prison treated him well. While detained, Stojanovi<U+0107> lectured a group of hostages about Marxism.<ref name=bas53>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 53<U+2013>57</ref>

[[File:Flag of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia.svg|thumb|Flag of the Yugoslav Partisans]]

On the day of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, the [[Executive Committee of the Communist International]]{{mdash}}headquartered in [[Moscow]]{{mdash}}telegraphed the Central Committee of the KPJ to take all measures to support and alleviate the struggle of the Soviet people, and to organise [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] [[Detachment (military)|detachment]]s to fight the Axis in Yugoslavia.<ref name=vuk152/> The Executive Committee also stressed that the fight, at the current stage, should not be about [[socialist revolution]], but about the liberation from the Axis occupiers. In response to this appeal, the leaders of the KPJ decided on 4&nbsp;July in Belgrade to launch a nationwide armed uprising,<ref name=rob23/> which began three days later in western Serbia.<ref>[[#Shepherd 2012|Shepherd 2012]], pp. 93<U+2013>94</ref> The members of the KPJ-led forces were called [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]], and their supreme commander was Tito.<ref name=rob23/> On 13&nbsp;July, in Sarajevo, the KPJ Provincial Committee for Bosnia-Herzegovina, headed by [[Svetozar Vukmanovi<U+0107>]], organised the province into military regions: Bosanska Krajina, [[Herzegovina]], Tuzla, and Sarajevo.<ref name=anic47/><ref>[[#Vukmanovic 1982|Vukmanovi<U+0107> 1982]], v. 1, p. 179</ref>

The Prijedor communists were keen to rescue Stojanovi<U+0107> from his imprisonment, but their attempts to bribe the Usta<U+0161>e to release him failed. They also considered storming the school in which he was kept.<ref name=bas53/> On 17&nbsp;July, just after midnight, Stojanovi<U+0107> asked a guard to let him go to the toilet on the first floor of the school. The guard let him go and followed closely behind him. When they were half way down the stairs, Stojanovi<U+0107> shouted "Fire!" as smoke came from a room on the second floor. During the commotion of the guards and hostages extinguishing the fire, Stojanovi<U+0107> entered the toilet and escaped through the window.<ref name=bas17>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 17<U+2013>20</ref> He went to the village of Orlovci, several kilometres from Prijedor, where he was accompanied by Rade Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107>{{mdash}}a young communist who had earlier escaped from the town.

===Yugoslav Partisan===

====Area of Kozara====

=====July<U+2013>August 1941=====
[[File:Palancist (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Kozara|Mount Kozara]], near the site of the first Partisan camp in the area]]

On the morning of 19&nbsp;July 1941, Stojanovi<U+0107> and Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> arrived at the camp of the communists and their sympathisers who escaped from Prijedor, situated at Rajli<U+0107>a Kosa above the village of [[Malo Palan<U+010D>i<U+0161>te]].<ref name=bas17/> The news of Stojanovi<U+0107>'s escape soon spread throughout the Prijedor district. The group, mostly in the early twenties, enjoyed an increase in their credibility and esteem since a well-known and respected doctor had joined their camp.<ref name=mar85/> People from surrounding Serb villages brought food and other supplies to Stojanovi<U+0107> and his young comrades. Stojanovi<U+0107> gave speeches to the villagers, telling them to be prepared for an impending uprising and urging them to bring him rifles they were hiding in their homes.<ref name=bas17/> The camp at Rajli<U+0107>a Kosa was the first Partisan camp in the Kozara area.<ref>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], p. 66</ref>

Kozara, located in northern Bosanska Krajina and centred around Mount Kozara, covers about {{Convert|2,500|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}}. In 1941, the area had a population of nearly 200,000 people. The villagers were mostly Serbs, and the towns in the area{{mdash}}the biggest of which was Prijedor{{mdash}}had a mixed Bosnian Muslim, Serb, and Croat population. Several villages were inhabited by [[Germans of Yugoslavia#Bosnia and Herzegovina|ethnic Germans]] or ''Volksdeutsche''. The economy of Kozara was dominated by agriculture, but there were about 6,000 workers employed in a coal mine and several plants. The first communist cells in the area were established shortly before the Axis invasion, mostly in the towns. Kozara had seen four uprisings against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] during the 19th century.<ref name=bor9/>

On the night of 25&nbsp;July 1941, at Orlovci, Stojanovi<U+0107> and seven other leading communists of Kozara had a meeting with [[<U+0110>uro Pucar]], the head of the KPJ Regional Committee for Bosanska Krajina. Pucar told the assembled communists that military actions against the enemy should start as soon as possible. The actions should be of a guerrilla type, for which purpose Partisan detachments should be formed. Stojanovi<U+0107> and [[Osman Karabegovi<U+0107>]] were appointed to lead the uprising in the Prijedor district.<ref name=mar89>[[#Marjanovic 1980|Marjanovi<U+0107> 1980]], pp. 89<U+2013>93</ref> On 27&nbsp;July, in western Bosanska Krajina, Partisans took the town of [[Drvar]], marking the beginning of the uprising in Bosnia-Herzegovina.<ref>[[#Hoare 2006|Hoare 2006]], p. 76</ref> At this stage, the insurgents in Kozara were still not organised into military units.<ref name=mar89/> In the district of Prijedor, Stojanovi<U+0107> and Karabegovi<U+0107> had little control over the men from the villages who took up arms.<ref name=bas17/> Pucar referred to the district's insurgents as the "Prijedor Company", the bulk of which were villagers, numbering several hundred men.<ref name=vuk211>[[#Vukmanovic 1982|Vukmanovi<U+0107> 1982]], v. 1, pp. 211<U+2013>214</ref> Many of them had no firearms.<ref name=bas17/>

According to Pucar, the Prijedor Company was directed to attack Ljubija.<ref name=vuk211/> On 30&nbsp;July, contrary to Stojanovi<U+0107>'s direct order, the insurgents attacked [[Veliko Palan<U+010D>i<U+0161>te]] and rescued fifteen hostages held by the Usta<U+0161>e.<ref name=mar89/> The insurgents then advanced toward Prijedor and developed a position facing the town, which was defended by Croatian Home Guards, Usta<U+0161>e, and German forces. A [[front line]] stabilised after three days of fighting, leaving the Prijedor Company in control of seven villages.<ref name=vuk211/> Railway traffic between Ljubija and Zagreb was disrupted, stopping the export of iron ore from Ljubija to Germany. The uprising in Kozara also involved the districts of [[Dubica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Dubica]] and [[Novi Grad, Bosanska Krajina|Novi]]. By mid-August, five detachments of Partisans had been formed within the territory held by the Kozara insurgents. These detachments, including the Prijedor Detachment commanded by Stojanovi<U+0107>, together held the front line facing Kozarac, Prijedor, [[Lje<U+0161>ljani]], [[Dobrljin]], [[Kostajnica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Kostajnica]], and Dubica.<ref name=ka134>[[#Karasijevic 1980|Karasijevi<U+0107> 1980]], pp. 134<U+2013>36</ref>

The leaders of the uprising in Kozara met on 15&nbsp;August 1941 in the village of [[Kne<U+017E>ica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Kne<U+017E>ica]]. At the conference, Stojanovi<U+0107> was recognised as the principal leader in Kozara; this recognition mostly resulted from his pre-war social status and good reputation among the people. It was concluded that forming a front line was a mistake because it was not consistent with guerrilla warfare.<ref name=mar94>[[#Marjanovic 1980|Marjanovi<U+0107> 1980]], pp. 94<U+2013>95</ref> At some point during the conference, Stojanovi<U+0107> stressed the importance of keeping as many enemy troops as possible in the area, so that they could not be sent to the Russian front to fight the [[Red Army]].<ref name=bas32>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 32<U+2013>35</ref> As the five detachments in the area were tied to their specific territories, it was decided that another detachment{{mdash}}which could operate anywhere in Kozara{{mdash}}should be formed. It was decided that Stojanovi<U+0107> would command this new Kozara Detachment, and Karabegovi<U+0107> would be the [[political commissar]]. It was promptly formed with about forty men. Carrying a [[Red flag (politics)|red banner]], the Kozara Detachment paraded for a couple of days through villages in the Partisan-held territory. The villagers gathered and Stojanovi<U+0107> delivered speeches.<ref name=mar94/>

Croatian Home Guards, Usta<U+0161>e, and a German battalion from Banja Luka{{mdash}}about 10,000 soldiers{{mdash}}attacked the Partisan-held territory in Kozara on 18&nbsp;August 1941. The enemy troops broke through the Partisan front line and penetrated into the area. They burnt houses and looted cattle and grain in the villages.<ref name=ka134/> Some of the villagers became demoralised, and blamed the Partisans for their losses; some placed white flags on their houses. The Partisan units retreated deeper into forested areas in the mountains. Stojanovi<U+0107> led the Kozara Detachment toward Lisina, the highest peak of Kozara. In the evening, he assembled his men and told them that they were in the army of the KPJ and all peoples of Yugoslavia, so they could not allow themselves to be attached to any specific village or area. He advised those who could not detach themselves from their homes to lay down their weapons and leave. Several men left the detachment, which then moved toward Lisina where they organised a camp and spent some time in military training and political indoctrination.<ref name=bas32/> The attack of 18&nbsp;August was the first counter-insurgency operation in Kozara, and the Partisans emerged from it without significant losses.<ref name=ka134/>

=====September<U+2013>December 1941=====
[[File:Lisina.jpg|thumb|Lisina, the highest peak of Kozara]]

The leaders of the Kozara uprising assembled again on 10&nbsp;September 1941, at the foot of Lisina. The five detachments of the Kozara Partisans were re-arranged into three companies,<ref>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], p. 42</ref> possessing 217 rifles altogether. At the end of September, the Kozara Partisans began attacking NDH and German troops, initially targeting weaker elements. These operations gave them military experience and they also captured weapons and ammunition from the enemy. More men joined the Partisans, and two more companies had been formed in Kozara by the end of October. The Partisans gained control over a number of villages.<ref name=ter136>[[#Terzic 1957|Terzi<U+0107> 1957]], pp. 136<U+2013>38</ref> After a reorganization, Partisan units in Kozara were merged into the 2nd Krajina National Liberation Partisan Detachment in early November 1941. Stojanovi<U+0107> was appointed commander of this detachment.<ref>[[#Terzic 1957|Terzi<U+0107> 1957]], pp. 134<U+2013>35</ref> By mid-November, it consisted of 670 men organised in six companies and armed with 510 rifles, 5 [[light machine gun]]s, and a [[heavy machine gun]].<ref name=ter136/>

Between the end of September and the end of December 1941, the Kozara Partisans conducted around forty military operations against the enemy. Stojanovi<U+0107> helped plan and execute the major operations, including the battles of [[Gornji Podgradci|Podgradci]], [[Mrakovica]], and [[Turjak (Gradi<U+0161>ka)|Turjak]]. Stojanovi<U+0107> argued that the village of Podgradci should be captured because it was situated deep within Kozara, because the enemy could easily disrupt the Partisans' advance toward other villages of the district of [[Gradi<U+0161>ka, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Gradi<U+0161>ka]], and because there was a sawmill in Podgradci which supplied the NDH and Germans.<ref name=bas84>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 84<U+2013>86</ref> On 23&nbsp;October 1941, Partisans under Stojanovi<U+0107>'s command took Podgradci after five hours of fighting.<ref name=ter136/> The sawmill and its stored products{{mdash}}including a large quantity of [[railroad tie]]s, with which the Germans were allegedly planning to repair railways destroyed by Soviet partisans in occupied Ukraine{{mdash}}were burnt down. Stojanovi<U+0107> saw this action as a symbolic collaboration with the Red Army. A number of Usta<U+0161>e and Croatian Home Guards were captured in Podgradci. The Usta<U+0161>e were promptly executed, and the Home Guards were given a speech by Stojanovi<U+0107> before the Partisans gave them food and escorted them across the [[Una (Sava)|Una River]].<ref name=bas84/>

The third counter-insurgency operation in Kozara was undertaken at the end of November 1941 by about 19,000 Croatian Home Guards, Usta<U+0161>e, and Germans.<ref name=ka137>[[#Karasijevic 1980|Karasijevi<U+0107> 1980]], pp. 137<U+2013>39</ref> The Partisans emerged from the operation without significant losses, though NDH propaganda claimed that the rebels in Kozara were destroyed and that Stojanovi<U+0107> had been killed.<ref name=bas96>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 96<U+2013>100</ref> The Kozara Partisans never repeated the mistake of frontal resistance.<ref name=ter136/> When stronger enemy forces advanced toward them, they manoeuvred to position themselves behind the attackers, thus avoiding battles they could not win. The Partisans therefore did not defend villages. During the third counter-insurgency operation, the Usta<U+0161>e and Germans killed hundreds of Serb civilians in the villages, resulting in a loss of support for the Partisans among the population. Stojanovi<U+0107> thought that a significant victory over the enemy would be the best way to restore the lost support.<ref name=bas96/>

After the third counter-insurgency operation, a battalion of the Croatian Home Guard was stationed on Mrakovica, a peak in Kozara.<ref name=ka137/> Stojanovi<U+0107> ordered an attack by five companies of the 2nd Krajina Detachment on the battalion, which began on 5&nbsp;December 1941 at 5:30 am. The battle ended by 9:30 am with a decisive victory to the Partisans.<ref name=bas120>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 120<U+2013>21</ref> They lost five men, while 78 Home Guards were killed and around 200 were captured.

The Partisans captured 134 Home Guards<ref>[[#Karasijevic 1980|Karasijevi<U+0107> 1980]], p. 140</ref> and letters to their families{{mdash}}which revealed their extremely low morale. The capture of Turjak opened up the district of Gradi<U+0161>ka to the Kozara Partisans. The Home Guards retreated from Podgradci without significant resistance. Soon, most of the district was under Partisan control and Stojanovi<U+0107>'s detachment controlled most of Mount Kozara and the surrounding Potkozarje region.<ref name=bas122/>

More men joined Stojanovi<U+0107>'s detachment, and at the end of 1941 it had over one thousand well-armed soldiers organised in three battalions of three companies each.<ref name=bas122/> The detachment established good relations with the Muslim population of the area, with a number of Muslims from Kozarac joining the Partisans.<ref name=ho269>[[#Hoare 2006|Hoare 2006]], p. 269</ref><ref name=vuk150>[[#Vukmanovic 1982|Vukmanovi<U+0107> 1982]], v. 2, pp. 150<U+2013>54</ref> On 21&nbsp;December at Lisina, Pucar held a meeting with the communists of Kozara.

On 24&nbsp;December, the Banja Luka headquarters of the Croatian Home Guard offered a reward for Stojanovi<U+0107>. A Home Guard document described him as the most intelligent and dangerous rebel leader, who planned and carried out attacks in a highly systematic manner. The headquarters was especially concerned about Stojanovi<U+0107>'s treatment of captured Home Guard soldiers<U+2014>giving them a communist propaganda speech, offering them food and cigarettes, dressing their wounds, and then letting them go home. According to the headquarters, this treatment meant that the soldiers would be useless in future operations against the Partisans.<ref name=bas129/> According to Drago Karasijevi<U+0107>, the courage and fighting spirit of the Kozara Partisans became famous in Bosanska Krajina, in other parts of [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and in the areas of the NDH bordering on Bosnia.<ref name=ka137/> In the villages of Kozara, people sang about Stojanovi<U+0107>:<ref name=bas122/>

====Area of Grme<U+010D>====
On 29 or 30&nbsp;December 1941, Stojanovi<U+0107> arrived in the area of [[Grme<U+010D>]] in western Bosanska Krajina, which was in the zone of responsibility of the 1st Krajina National Liberation Partisan Detachment.<ref name=bok299>[[#Bokan 1988|Bokan 1988]], pp. 299<U+2013>303</ref> This zone also included Drvar, where the uprising in Bosnia-Herzegovina began. The military activities of the Partisans there diminished after the capture of Drvar by Italian troops on 25&nbsp;September 1941. In the Italians' propaganda, they  presented themselves as protectors of the Serbian people against the Usta<U+0161>e.<ref name=vuk150/> Groups of Serbs collaborated with the Italians. According to Karabegovi<U+0107>, the Partisans of the 1st Krajina became more active after Pucar held a conference with their commanders on 15&nbsp;December 1941, but this activity was still weak in northern parts of Grme<U+010D>. Stojanovi<U+0107> went there to counter the Italian propaganda and to mobilise the Partisans against the Italians and their collaborators;<ref name=vuk150/> he was accompanied by Karabegovi<U+0107>.<ref name=bok299/>

[[File:Milos Obilic Hilandar.jpg|thumb|Serbian epic hero [[Milo<U+0161> Obili<U+0107>]], with whom Stojanovi<U+0107> was compared by villagers in Grme<U+010D>]]

According to the writer [[Branko <U+0106>opi<U+0107>]], who was a Partisan in Grme<U+010D>, Stojanovi<U+0107> was greeted by a crowd of villagers and welcomed with the traditional [[bread and salt]] ceremony when he crossed the [[Sana (river)|Sana River]]. Prominent villagers shook hands with him, and they compared him with [[Milo<U+0161> Obili<U+0107>]]{{mdash}}a famous [[Serbian epic poetry|Serbian epic]] hero from the medieval [[Battle of Kosovo]]. Several women approached Stojanovi<U+0107> to kiss his hands; he declined this mark of respect, saying that he was not a priest but a communist.<ref name=bas136>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 136<U+2013>40</ref>

Stojanovi<U+0107> visited the villages in the area, inspecting individual companies and [[platoon]]s of the 1st Krajina Detachment. His visits were accompanied by parades of Partisan units and by mass gatherings. Partisan songs were sung, slogans were shouted, and banners were waved. Stojanovi<U+0107> gave speeches to the villagers and soldiers. He said that the Italian troops in the area were not protectors of the Serbs, but occupiers and enemies. He branded those who collaborated with the Italians as traitors to the Serbian people.<ref name=bok299/><ref name=bas131>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 131<U+2013>35</ref> Stojanovi<U+0107>'s speeches were not well received by some people, who spread rumours that he was not Mladen Stojanovi<U+0107>, but a "Turk" (Muslim) impersonator. According to them, Stojanovi<U+0107> had been killed by the Usta<U+0161>e in August 1941 and the communists were using an impersonator to deceive the people. Few people gave credence to these rumours.<ref name=bas136/>

On 22&nbsp;January 1942, at the headquarters of the 1st Krajina Detachment in the village of [[Majki<U+0107> Japra]], Stojanovi<U+0107> presided over a conference of the detachment staff and political activists of Grme<U+010D>. He criticised the detachment headquarters because it had no division of functions and there was no personal accountability among its members. He also stated the headquarters had no communication with the companies of the detachment, did not act as a military-political leadership, and there were no designated couriers available at all times at the headquarters. Stojanovi<U+0107> was generally pleased with the Grme<U+010D> Partisans, describing them as courageous, enthusiastic, firm, and trustworthy but somewhat inexperienced. However, he said that the platoons of the detachment were dispersed in villages and had no contact with each other. In this way, according to Stojanovi<U+0107>, the Partisans were losing their soldierly characteristics and becoming more like peasants. Stojanovi<U+0107> criticised the views of some Partisans that political commissars should be abolished. He warned that the Partisans who wore emblems other than the [[Red Star#Symbol of communism|red star]] would be punished for indiscipline.<ref name=bok305>[[#Bokan 1988|Bokan 1988]], pp. 305<U+2013>307</ref>

At the conference, Stojanovi<U+0107> installed Milorad Mijatovi<U+0107>{{mdash}}a Partisan from Kozara{{mdash}}as the new commander of the 1st Krajina and Petar Vojnovi<U+0107> as deputy commander, while Velimir Stojni<U+0107> and Salamon "Moni" Levi remained as commissar and deputy commissar, respectively.<ref name=bok305/> Levi was an acquaintance of Stojanovi<U+0107>'s from his visits to Vienna in 1921 and 1922.<ref>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], p. 92</ref> During his tour of Grme<U+010D>, Stojanovi<U+0107> met the young writer Branko <U+0106>opi<U+0107>, and encouraged him to write poetry about the fight of the Partisans. Stojanovi<U+0107> said poetry was more acceptable for the Partisans than prose. "Poetry and revolution always go hand in hand," said Stojanovi<U+0107>.<ref name=bas136/> He stayed in the area until mid-February 1942.<ref>[[#Bokan 1988|Bokan 1988]], p. 329</ref> The Partisan leadership of Bosnia-Herzegovina considered that Stojanovi<U+0107> had successfully countered the Italian propaganda and improved the condition of the 1st Krajina Detachment during his tour.<ref name=vuk150/>

====North-west central Bosnia====

Stojanovi<U+0107> left Grme<U+010D> and went to [[Skender Vakuf]] in northwest central Bosnia to participate in the first regional conference of the KPJ in Bosanska Krajina,<ref name=bas136/> which was held from 21 to 23&nbsp;February 1942.<ref name=vuk36>[[#Vukmanovic 1982|Vukmanovi<U+0107> 1982]], v. 2, p. 36</ref> In the Partisan territorial structure, the military-political region of Bosanska Krajina included central Bosnia.<ref name=anic47>[[#Anic 1982|Ani<U+0107>, Joksimovi<U+0107>, & Guti<U+0107> 1982]], pp. 47<U+2013>48</ref> At the Skender Vakuf conference, presided over by Pucar, Stojanovi<U+0107> and Karabegovi<U+0107>,<ref name=bas141>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 141<U+2013>42</ref> the participants analysed the military and political situation in the region. The increase of Chetnik influence{{mdash}}which was strongest in southeastern Bosanska Krajina and northwest central Bosnia in the zones of responsibility of the 3rd and 4th Krajina Detachments{{mdash}}was a big problem for the KPJ. A number of Partisans of these detachments joined the Chetnik side.<ref name=sam7>[[#Samardzija 1987|Samard<U+017E>ija 1987]], pp. 7<U+2013>9</ref><ref name=tri22>[[#Trikic 1982|Triki<U+0107> & Rapaji<U+0107> 1982]], pp. 22<U+2013>25</ref> Only in Kozara had Chetnik influence been held at bay.<ref name=ter136/><ref name=vuk150/> At the conference, Stojanovi<U+0107> was appointed to lead a unified command of Partisan forces in Bosanska Krajina,<ref name=vuk36/> but on 24&nbsp;February he was replaced with [[Kosta Na<U+0111>]].<ref>[[#Bokan 1988|Bokan 1988]], p. 332</ref><ref name=tri35>[[#Trikic 1982|Triki<U+0107> & Rapaji<U+0107> 1982]], pp. 35<U+2013>36</ref> The unified command was named the Operational Headquarters for Bosanska Krajina, and Stojanovi<U+0107> became its chief of staff and deputy commander.<ref name=sam7/><ref>[[#Anic 1982|Ani<U+0107>, Joksimovi<U+0107>, & Guti<U+0107> 1982]], p. 101</ref><ref>[[#Hoare 2006|Hoare 2006]], p. 257</ref><ref name=tri51>[[#Trikic 1982|Triki<U+0107> & Rapaji<U+0107> 1982]], pp. 51<U+2013>52</ref>

According to Na<U+0111>, the split between the Partisans and the Chetniks in Bosanska Krajina and central Bosnia began on 14&nbsp;December 1941 in the village of [[Javorani]]. Lazar Te<U+0161>anovi<U+0107>, the schoolteacher in Javorani, influenced members of the local Partisan unit to join the Chetnik side.<ref>[[#Nadj_1979|Na<U+0111> 1979]], pp. 85<U+2013>86</ref> Te<U+0161>anovi<U+0107> then organised a Chetnik unit of about 70 to 80 men,<ref name=tri22/> and at the beginning of March 1942 he and his men were in the village of [[Lipovac (<U+010C>elinac)|Lipovac]]. On 5&nbsp;March, Stojanovi<U+0107>, Na<U+0111>, and Danko Mitrov (the commander of the 4th Krajina Detachment) set out for Lipovac with the Kozara Proletarian Company<ref name=tri35/>{{mdash}}an assault unit formed in February 1942.<ref name=tri27>[[#Trikic 1982|Triki<U+0107> & Rapaji<U+0107> 1982]], p. 27</ref> According to some sources, they went to Lipovac for pre-arranged negotiations with Te<U+0161>anovi<U+0107>,<ref name=sam7/> while other sources state that they intended to disarm Te<U+0161>anovi<U+0107> and his Chetniks.<ref name=tri35/> When the column of the Partisans approached the school in Lipovac, they were ambushed by Chetniks, and Stojanovi<U+0107> was severely wounded in the head.<ref name=bas163>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 163<U+2013>171</ref> The Partisans remained pinned down by Chetnik fire until evening; thirteen were killed and eight beside Stojanovi<U+0107> were wounded. At nightfall, he and the other wounded were transported to the Partisan field hospital in [[Jo<U+0161>avka Gornja|Jo<U+0161>avka]].<ref name=tri35/>

Stojanovi<U+0107> was in the field hospital for about 10 days before he was moved to a house around {{Convert|800|m|yd|abbr=off}} away.<ref name=bas163/> At the end of March 1942, the Operational Headquarters for Bosanska Krajina and the headquarters of the 4th Krajina Detachment were both located in Jo<U+0161>avka. The two headquarters and the field hospital were attacked on the night of 31&nbsp;March by members of the Jo<U+0161>avka Partisan Company, who had joined the Chetnik side under the influence and leadership of Radoslav "Rade" Radi<U+0107>, the deputy commissar of the 4th Krajina Detachment. That night, the Chetniks killed 15 Partisans in Jo<U+0161>avka.<ref name=tri22>[[#Trikic 1982|Triki<U+0107> & Rapaji<U+0107> 1982]], pp. 71<U+2013>73</ref><ref>[[#Hoare 2006|Hoare 2006]], p. 261</ref> According to Danica Perovi<U+0107>, the physician who attended Stojanovi<U+0107>, the Chetniks took his weapons and posted a sentry outside the house. Through a messenger, Radi<U+0107> told Stojanovi<U+0107> to write a letter ordering Danko Mitrov to remove all Partisan units from the area around Jo<U+0161>avka. Stojanovi<U+0107>, however, wrote a letter encouraging Mitrov to continue the Partisan fight. The next night, a group of Chetniks came to Stojanovi<U+0107>, placed him on a blanket, and carried him out of the house. When they approached a nearby stream, one of them shot Stojanovi<U+0107> twice, killing him.<ref name=bas163/>

On 2 April, local villagers buried Stojanovi<U+0107> on a steep, wooded hillside.<ref name=tri27/> By the end of April 1942, most of the companies of the 4th Krajina National Liberation Partisan Detachment had joined the Chetnik side or disintegrated.<ref>[[#Borojevic 1973|Borojevi<U+0107>, Samard<U+017E>ija, & Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1973]], pp. 91<U+2013>92</ref> Rade Radi<U+0107> became the commander of the Chetnik detachments in Bosanska Krajina. After the war, Radi<U+0107> was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of Yugoslavia; he was executed by firing squad in 1945.<ref name=sam7/> Stojanovi<U+0107>'s remains were exhumed and reburied at Prijedor in November 1961.<ref name=bas5>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 5<U+2013>6</ref>

On 19&nbsp;April 1942, the headquarters of the 2nd Krajina Detachment decided to change its name to the 2nd Krajina National Liberation Partisan Detachment "Mladen Stojanovi<U+0107>". The Kozara Partisans vowed to avenge Stojanovi<U+0107>'s death on all the "[[Enemy of the people|enemies of the people]]".<ref name=bor22>[[#Borojevic 1973|Borojevi<U+0107>, Samard<U+017E>ija, & Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1973]], pp. 22<U+2013>23</ref> The 2nd Krajina Detachment and four companies of the 1st Krajina Detachment liberated Prijedor on 16&nbsp;May 1942.<ref name=ho269/><ref name=bor22/> On 7&nbsp;August 1942, the supreme headquarters of the Yugoslav Partisans proclaimed Stojanovi<U+0107> a [[People's Hero of Yugoslavia]].<ref name=bas5/>

After the war, a monument to Stojanovi<U+0107> was built by his brother Sreten and erected in Prijedor. Streets, firms, schools, hospitals, pharmacies, and associations were named after Stojanovi<U+0107> throughout the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Songs were composed about Stojanovi<U+0107>, celebrating him as a hero.<ref name=bas5/> A [[Partisan film]] about him, titled ''Doktor Mladen'', was released in Yugoslavia in 1975. Stojanovi<U+0107> was played by [[Ljuba Tadi<U+0107>]], who received an award for his performance at the [[Pula Film Festival]].<ref>[[#Beric 2013|Beri<U+0107> 2013]], para. 1</ref>

Each year in April, Stojanovi<U+0107> is commemorated in Prijedor and wreaths are laid at his monument. At the 2012 commemoration, the president of the Partisan War Veterans' Association of [[Republika Srpska]] declared:<ref name=gradprijedor>{{cite web| publisher = City of Prijedor| date = 2 April 2012| language = Serbian| title = Pavi<U+0107> <U+2013> Ideale heroja Mladena Stojanovi<U+0107>a prenijeti na omladinu| trans_title = Pavi<U+0107> <U+2013> The Ideals of the Hero Mladen Stojanovi<U+0107> to Be Passed on to the Youth| url = http://www.gradprijedor.com/drustvo/pavic-ideale-heroja-mladena-stojanovica-prenijeti-na-omladinu| archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20131105134758/http://www.gradprijedor.com/drustvo/pavic-ideale-heroja-mladena-stojanovica-prenijeti-na-omladinu| archivedate=2013-11-05| deadurl=no| separator=.}}</ref>

==Poetry==

In his youth, Stojanovi<U+0107> wrote poems, only one of which is published<U+2014>in a 1918 issue of the literary magazine ''[[Knji<U+017E>evni jug]]'',<ref name=bas180/><ref>[[#Stojanovic 1918|Stojanovi<U+0107> 1918]], p. 222</ref> whose editor was [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Ivo Andri<U+0107>]]. A number of Stojanovi<U+0107>'s poems are preserved in a notebook that belonged to his closest school friend Todor Ili<U+0107>. According to the poet Dragan Kolund<U+017E>ija, Stojanovi<U+0107>'s poems are [[Lyric poetry|lyrical]] miniatures composed in [[free verse]], focused on man and nature, and filled with melancholy. Kolund<U+017E>ija finds that what inspired Stojanovi<U+0107> to write poetry is reflected in his verse ''Krvav je bol'' (''Pain is bloody'').<ref name=bas180/> According to poet [[Miroslav Feldman]], who first met Stojanovi<U+0107> in 1919 in Zagreb, his poems were sad and permeated with a yearning for a brighter, more joyous life.<ref name=bas101/>

Stojanovi<U+0107> wrote an essay, which is published as the foreword to a 1920 book of poetry by Feldman, titled ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=q_iPOQAACAAJ Iza Sunca]'' (''Behind the Sun''). In 1925, Stojanovi<U+0107> initiated the creation of an anthology of Yugoslav lyric poetry. On this project, he worked with Feldman and [[Gustav Krklec]]. The poets completed the anthology, but for an unknown reason it was never published.<ref>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 103<U+2013>6</ref> Stojanovi<U+0107>'s poetic inclinations were manifested in his letters to his wife Mira Stojanovi<U+0107>, especially when he writes about his patients:<ref name=bas113>[[#Basic 1969|Ba<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1969]], pp. 113<U+2013>14</ref>
