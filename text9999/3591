'''Vamana''' ([[Devanagari]]: <U+0935><U+093E><U+092E><U+0928>, [[IAST]]: ''V<U+0101>mana'') is described in the [[Puranic]] texts of [[Hinduism]] as the '''''Fifth [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]]''''', and the first incarnation of the Second Age, or the [[Yuga|Treta yuga]]. Also he is the first Avatar of Vishnu which appears with a completely human form, though it was that of a dwarf [[brahmin]]. He is also sometimes known as ''Upendra''.  The [[Vamana]] [[avatar]] is commemorated by the festival of [[Onam]].

==Origin==
Vamana was born to [[Aditi]] and [[Kashyapa]].<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/vp/vp075.htm Account of the several Manus and Manwantaras] [[Vishnu Purana]], translated by [[Horace Hayman Wilson]], 1840, Book III: Chapter I. 265:22, at the request of the deities Vish<U+0144>u was born as a dwarf, V<U+00E1>mana, the son of Adit<U+00ED> by Ka<U+015B>yapa. By applying to Mahabali for alms Ka<U+015B>yapa was promised by the prince whatever he might demand, notwithstanding <U+015A>ukra (the preceptor of the Daityas). The dwarf demanded as much space as he could step over at three steps and upon the assent of Mahabali he enlarged himself to such dimensions as to stride over the three worlds. Being worshipped however by Mahabali and his ancestor Prahl<U+00E1>da, he conceded to them the sovereignty of P<U+00E1>t<U+00E1>la.</ref> His twelfth of the [[Adityas]]. Vamana is held to be the younger brother of [[Indra]].

===Vedas===
In Rigveda there comes a reference for Vishnu - Who has measured the three lokas in three steps.The two legs can be seen but the third can not.This probably grew up into independent tale in later vedic period.

=== Hinduism ===
[[File:Vamana1.jpg|thumb|Vamana as ''Trivikrama'' - depicted having three legs, one on the earth, raised leg in the heavens and third on [[Mahabali|Bali]]'s head.]]
The legend of [[Bhagavata Purana|Bhagavata]] has it that the Vamana avatar was taken by Vishnu to restore [[Indra|Indra's]] authority over the heavens, which was taken away by [[Mahabali]], a benevolent [[Asura]] King. [[Mahabali|Bali]] was the grandson of [[Prahlada]], the son of Hiranyakshipu. Vamana, in the guise of a short [[Brahman]], carried a wooden [[umbrella]] and requested three steps of land for him to live in. Given a promise of three steps of land by King [[Mahabali]] against the warning given by his Guru [[Sukracharya]], Vamana, The Supreme God enlarged himself to such dimensions as to stride over the three worlds. He had grown so huge that he could step from heaven to earth, and earth to the lower worlds in two simple steps. King [[Mahabali]], unable to fulfill the promise of three paces of land to the Supreme God, offers his head for the third step. Thus Vamana places his foot on King Mahabali's head and gives him immortality for his benevolence. Being worshipped however by Mahabali and his ancestor Prahl<U+00E1>da, he conceded to them the sovereignty of [[Patala|P<U+00E1>t<U+00E1>la]] (netherworld).

=== Jainism ===

Sacred texts from [[Jainism]] mentions the legend of Vamana. The legend begins as an ill natured man having several issues with Jain Munis. Having confronted these issues and the behavior of the ill-man to the King, the King banishes the ill man from his kingdom. 

After going to another kingdom, the ill-man manages to help and get close to the King of that kingdom. After recognizing the help aided by this man, the King promises to grant one wish to him. Having kept his animosity with the Jain monks, he asks to be made King for 4 months during [[Chaturmas]] (a holy time for the Jains). The King, after consent, makes the man to be the King of the kingdom. The ill-man decides to take advantage of the situation by ordering that he must eat all Jain Muni's meal, making them not eat for the rest of the day as the food would be considered contaminated. The Jain Shravaks and Shravikas, recognizing the intents of the ill-man, the great Vamana munivar was consulted. He had the capability to grow his figure to being very big or small. 

Dressed up as a dwarf Brahman, he went to the Raja's house (which was ruled by the ill-man at the time) while the man was performing a pooja. Near the end of the pooja, the one performing the pooja must give something to those that were present at the pooja. Upon asking what the dwarf man wanted, he simply wanted three foot of land. The King consents and agrees to provide this land to the dwarf man. 

Soon Vamana grew so large that one foot touched the entire Earth, another foot was touched by the heavens and did not have a third foot to provide. Not satisfying the requests of Vamana, the ill-man, realizes his bad behavior and bows his head down to Vamana to put his third foot on his head.

==Symbolism==
[[Image:033-vamana.jpg|thumb|200px|Vamana avatar with King Mahabali]]
Vamana taught King Mahabali that arrogance and pride should be abandoned if any advancement in life is to be made, and that wealth should never be taken for granted since it can so easily be taken away. Vamana then took on the form of [[Mahavishnu]] and was pleased by King Mahabali's determination and ability to keep his promise, despite his spiritual master's curse and the prospect of losing all his wealth. [[Vishnu]] named the King ''Mahabali'' since he was a ''Mahatma'' (great soul). He allowed Mahabali to return to the spiritual sky to associate with Prahalada (the demoniac Hiranyakashipu's pious son) and other divine beings. Mahavishnu also declared that Mahabali would be able to rule the universe in the following yuga (age). Mahabali was the grandson of [[Prahlada]], being the son of Prahlada's son [[Virochana]] who was killed in a battle with the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]].

Mahabali is supposed to return every year to the land of his people, to ensure that they are prosperous. 

=== In Sikhism ===
Vamana is discussed in the Guru Granth Sahib, the sacred text of Sikhism.<ref> P. 1390 ''Guru Granth Sahib''</ref> 

::Satjugi tai manio Chalio bali bavan bhaio 
::In Satyayuga, you sported as the dwarf incarnation, and fooled Bali. 

On page 1330 of the Guru Granth Sahib, Vamana is mentioned as the "enticer" of Baliraja.<ref> P. 1330, ''Sri Guru Granth Sahib'', Vol. 4  </ref>

==In the Ramayana==
[[Image:Vamana_Avatar.jpg|thumb|200px|Dwarf Vamana avatar at [[Rani ki vav]], [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]], [[Gujarat]]]]

According to the ''[[Adhyatma Ramayana]]'' It is also said that Vamanadeva is the guard of the gate of Bali Maharaja's planet Sutala<ref>P. 281 ''The Adhyatma Ramayana: Concise English Version'' By Chandan Lal Dhody </ref><ref> P. 134 ''{{IAST|Sr<U+012B> R<U+016B>pa Gosv<U+0101>m<U+012B>'s Bhakti-ras<U+0101>m<U+1E5B>ta-Sindhuh}}'' By R<U+016B>pagosv<U+0101>m<U+012B>, Bhakti Hridaya Bon </ref> and will remain so forever.<ref> P. 134 ''Sri R<U+016B>pa Gosv<U+0101>m<U+012B>s Bhakti-ras<U+0101>mrta-sindhuh'' By R<U+016B>pagosv<U+0101>m<U+012B> </ref> [[Tulsidas]]' Ramayana too declares that Vamana became the "dwarpal" (''gate-defender'') of Bali.<ref> P. 246 ''Complete Works of Gosvami Tulsidas'' By Satya Prakash Bahadur, Tulas<U+012B>d<U+0101>sa </ref> 

It is said that Mahabali attained [[Moksha]] by atmanivedinam.<ref>P. 178 ''Vedanta Established in Its Own Light =: Sushka Vedanta Tamo Bhaskaram'' By Malayalaswamulavaru </ref> Krishna in the Sri R<U+016B>pa Gosv<U+0101>m<U+012B>s Bhakti-ras<U+0101>mrta-sindhuh<ref> P. 379 ''Sri R<U+016B>pa Gosv<U+0101>m<U+012B>s Bhakti-ras<U+0101>mrta-sindhuh By R<U+016B>pagosv<U+0101>m<U+012B>'' By R<U+016B>pagosv<U+0101>m<U+012B> </ref> says that Mahabali came to Him or attained Him. Some traditions also hold that Vamana was an avatar of [[Ganesha]].<ref> P. 22 ''Bhavan's Journal'' By Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan </ref>
