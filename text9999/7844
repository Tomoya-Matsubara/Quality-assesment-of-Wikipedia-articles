'''Metallica''' is an American [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band that formed in 1981 in {{city-state|Los Angeles|California}}. Founded when drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] posted an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper, Metallica's original line-up consisted of Ulrich, [[rhythm guitarist]] and vocalist [[James Hetfield]], [[lead guitarist]] [[Dave Mustaine]], and [[bassist]] [[Ron McGovney]]. These last two were later ejected from the band, in favor of [[Kirk Hammett]] and [[Cliff Burton]], respectively. The ejection of Mustaine resulted in a feud between him and Metallica. In September 1986, Metallica's tour bus skidded out of control and flipped, which resulted in Burton being crushed under the bus and killed. [[Jason Newsted]] replaced him less than two months later. Newsted left the band in 2001 and was replaced by [[Robert Trujillo]] in 2003. 

Metallica's early releases included fast [[tempos]], [[instrumentals]], and aggressive [[musicianship]] that placed them as one of the "Big Four" of the [[thrash metal]] subgenre alongside [[Slayer]], [[Megadeth]] and [[Anthrax (band)|Anthrax]]. The band earned a growing fan base in the [[underground music]] community, and some critics say the 1986 release ''[[Master of Puppets]]'' is one of the most influential and "heavy" thrash metal albums. The band achieved substantial commercial success with its self-titled 1991 album ''[[Metallica (album)|Metallica]]'', which debuted at number one on the ''[[Billboard 200]]''. Some critics and fans believed the band changed its musical direction to appeal to the [[Mainstream (terminology)|mainstream]] audience.  With the release of ''[[Load (album)|Load]]'' in 1996, Metallica distanced itself from earlier releases in what has been described as "an almost [[alternative rock|alternative]] [rock] approach", and the band faced accusations of "[[selling out]]".

In 2000, Metallica was among several artists who filed a lawsuit against [[Napster]] for sharing the band's copyright-protected material for free without the band members' consent. A settlement was reached, and Napster became a pay-to-use service. Despite reaching number one on the ''Billboard 200'', the release of ''[[St. Anger]]'' in 2003 disappointed some critics and fans with the exclusion of [[guitar solos]], and the "steel-sounding" [[snare drum]]. A film titled ''[[Some Kind of Monster (film)|Some Kind of Monster]]'' documented the recording process of ''St. Anger''.

Metallica has released eight [[studio album]]s, two live albums, two [[Extended play|EPs]], twenty-two music videos, thirty-nine [[single (music)|singles]] and has finished recording their upcoming ninth studio album, ''[[Death Magnetic]]''. The band has become one of the most commercially successful and influential heavy metal acts. With 100 million records sold worldwide, including 57 million in the United States, the band has won seven [[Grammy Awards]], and has had four albums peak at number one on the ''Billboard 200''.<ref name="RIAA Top Sellers"/> The band's 1991 album ''Metallica'', has sold over 15 million copies, which makes it the 25th highest selling album in the United States.<ref name="RIAA database"/>

== History ==
=== Early days (1981<U+2013>1983)===
Metallica was formed in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], in early 1981 when drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper<U+2014>''[[The Recycler]]''<U+2014>which read "Drummer looking for other metal musicians to [[jam (music)|jam]] with [[Tygers of Pan Tang]], [[Diamond Head (band)|Diamond Head]] and [[Iron Maiden]]."<ref name="Metallica timeline Early 1981 - Early 1982"/> Guitarists [[James Hetfield]] and Hugh Tanner of [[Leather Charm]] answered the advertisement. Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich asked [[Metal Blade Records]] founder [[Brian Slagel]] if he could record a song for the label's upcoming compilation ''[[Metal Massacre]]''. Slagel accepted, and Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play [[rhythm guitar]].<ref name="Metallica timeline Early 1981 - Early 1982">{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-11-30}}</ref>

Ulrich talked to his friend Ron Quintana, who was brainstorming names for a [[fanzine]]. Quintana had proposed the names Metal Mania and Metallica. Convincing him to use ''Metal Mania'', Ulrich used Metallica for the name of his band. A second advertisement was placed in ''The Recycler'' for a position as [[lead guitarist]]. [[Dave Mustaine]] answered, and, after seeing his expensive guitar equipment, Ulrich and Hetfield recruited him. In early 1982, Metallica recorded its first original song "Hit the Lights" for the ''Metal Massacre I'' compilation. Hetfield played bass on the song and [[Lloyd Grant]] was credited with a guitar solo.<ref name="Metallica timeline Early 1981 - Early 1982"/> Released on [[June 14]], [[1982]], early pressings of ''Metal Massacre I'' listed the band incorrectly as "Mettallica". Although angered by the error, Metallica managed to create enough "[[Word of mouth|buzz]]" with the song and the band played its first live show on [[March 14]], [[1982]], at [[Radio City]] in [[Anaheim, California]] with newly recruited bassist [[Ron McGovney]].<ref name="Metallica timeline March 14,1982 - July 6, 1982">{{cite web

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Powermetalcard.jpg|right|thumb|An early Metallica business card (''circa 1982''). The name of the band's ''[[Power Metal (Metallica album)|Power Metal]]'' demo originated from this card.]] -->
Metallica recorded its first demo titled ''[[Power Metal (Metallica album)|Power Metal]]'', a name inspired by Quintana's early business cards in early 1982. In the Fall of 1982, Ulrich and Hetfield attended a show at the nightclub [[Whisky a Go Go]], which featured bassist [[Cliff Burton]] in a band called Trauma. The two were "blown away" by Burton's use of a [[wah-wah pedal]] and asked him to join Metallica. Hetfield and Mustaine wanted McGovney out as they thought that he "didn't contribute anything, he just followed."<ref name="Metallica timeline Fall 1982 - April 16, 1983"/> Although Burton initially declined the offer, by the end of the year he accepted on the condition the band move to San Francisco. Metallica's first live performance with Burton was at the nightclub The Stone in March 1983, and the first recording to feature Burton was the 1983 ''[[Metallica demos#Megaforce Demo|Megaforce]]'' demo.<ref name="Metallica timeline Fall 1982 - April 16, 1983">{{cite web

Metallica was ready to record its debut album, but when Metal Blade was unable to cover the additional cost, the band began looking for other options. Concert promoter [[Johny Zazula|Johnny "Z" Zazula]], who had heard the 1982 ''[[No Life 'til Leather]]'' demo, offered to broker a record deal with Metallica and [[New York City]]-based record labels. After receiving no interest from various record labels, Zazula borrowed the money to cover the record's recording budget and signed Metallica to his own label, [[Megaforce Records]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Christe|2003|p=86}}</ref> Band members decided to kick Mustaine out of the band due to drug and [[alcohol abuse]], and violent behavior.<ref>Cecolini, Vinny, Foreclosure of a Team ''Metal Hammer'' November 1998</ref> [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]] guitarist [[Kirk Hammett]] flew in to replace Mustaine the same afternoon.

=== ''Kill 'Em All'' and ''Ride the Lightning'' (1983<U+2013>1984)===
In 1983, Metallica traveled to [[Rochester, New York]] to record its first album, ''Metal Up Your Ass'', with production duties handled by Paul Curcio. Due to conflicts with the band's record label and the distributors' refusal to release an album with that name, it was renamed ''[[Kill 'Em All]]''. Released on Megaforce Records in the U.S. and [[Music for Nations]] in Europe, the album peaked on the ''Billboard 200'' at number 120,<ref name="Metallica Chart Positions"/> and although the album was not initially a financial success, it earned Metallica a growing fan base in the [[Underground music|underground]] metal scene.

Metallica recorded its second studio album, ''[[Ride the Lightning]]'', at Sweet Silence Studios in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]]. Released in August 1984, the album peaked at number 100 on the ''Billboard 200''.<ref name="Metallica Chart Positions"/> A French printing press mistakenly printed green covers for the album, which are now considered collectors' items. Other songs on the album include "[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (Metallica song)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]", "[[Creeping Death]]" (which tells the biblical story of the Hebrews' exodus from slavery in Egypt, focusing on the various plagues that were visited on the Egyptians), and the [[instrumental]] "[[The Call of Ktulu]]". Mustaine received a writing credit for "Ride the Lightning" and "The Call of Ktulu".<ref name="Metallica timeline October-December , 1983 - August, 1984"/>

=== Death of Cliff Burton (1986<U+2013>1987)===

[[Image:Cliff Burton Memorial.PNG|left|thumb|A memorial for Burton in [[Ljungby, Sweden]]]]
On [[September 27]], [[1986]], during the European leg of Metallica's [[Damage Inc. tour]], members drew cards to see which bunk of the tour bus they would sleep in. Burton won and chose to sleep in Hammett's bunk. Around dawn near D<U+00F6>rarp, [[Sweden]], the bus driver lost control and [[Skid mark|skidded]], which caused the bus to flip several times. Ulrich, Hammett, and Hetfield sustained no serious injuries; however, bassist Burton was pinned under the bus and was killed. Hetfield recalls, "I saw the bus lying right on him. I saw his legs sticking out. I freaked. The bus driver, I recall, was trying to yank the blanket out from under him to use for other people. I just went, 'Don't fucking do that!' I already wanted to kill the guy."<ref name="Metallica timeline June 26, 1986 - September 27, 1986">{{cite web

Newsted learned Metallica's entire setlist, and after the audition Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joint in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich, and Hammett decided that Newsted was the one to replace Burton, and Newsted's first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California. The members took it on themselves to "initiate" Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of [[wasabi]].<ref name="Metallica timeline October, 1986 - March, 1987"/>

In March 1987, Hetfield broke his wrist a second time skateboarding. Guitar technician Marshall returned playing rhythm guitar, but the injury forced the band to cancel a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' appearance. Metallica finished its tour in the early months of 1987, and in August 1987 an all-covers [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''[[The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited]]'' was released. The EP was recorded in an effort to utilize the band's newly constructed recording studio, test out the talents of Newsted, and to relieve grief and stress following the death of Burton. A video titled ''[[Cliff 'Em All]]'' was released in 1987 commemorating Burton's three years in Metallica. Footage included [[Bass solo#Bass guitar solos|bass solos]], home videos, and pictures.<ref name="Metallica timeline August 21, 1987 - December 4, 1987">{{cite web

=== ''Load'', ''ReLoad'', and ''Garage Inc.'' (1994<U+2013>1999)===

After almost three years of touring to support ''Metallica'', including a headlining performance at [[Woodstock '94]], Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band took a break in the summer of 1995 and played three outdoor shows which included headlining [[Donington Park]] in the U.K., supported by [[Slayer]], [[Skid Row (heavy metal band)|Skid Row]], [[Slash's Snakepit]], [[Therapy?]], and [[Corrosion of Conformity]]. The short tour was titled [[Escape From The Studio '95]]. The band spent roughly one year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of ''[[Load (album)|Load]]'' in 1996, which entered the ''Billboard 200'' and [[ARIA Charts]] at number one, marking the band's second number one.<ref name="Metallica Chart Positions"/> The cover of ''Load'' was created by [[Andres Serrano]], and was called ''Blood and Semen III''.

The band members received haircuts, and headlined the alternative rock festival [[Lollapalooza]], which lead to further accusations.<ref name="The Playboy Interview - Metallica"/><ref name="Load review"/>

During early production of the album, the band had produced enough material for a [[double album]]. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released, and the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in the follow-up album, ''[[ReLoad]]''. The cover was created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine.<ref name="Metallica timeline December, 1995 - June 27, 1996"/> ''ReLoad'' peaked at number one on the ''Billboard 200'', and number two on the Top Canadian Album chart.<ref name="Metallica Chart Positions"/> Hetfield noted in the 2004 documentary film ''[[Some Kind of Monster (film)|Some Kind of Monster]]'' that the songs on these albums were initially thought by the band to be of average quality, and were "polished and reworked" until judged to be releasable.<ref name="Some Kind of Monster film"/> To promote ''ReLoad'', Metallica performed on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in December 1997, performing "[[Fuel (song)|Fuel]]" and "[[The Memory Remains]]" with [[Marianne Faithfull]].<ref name="Metallica timeline November 18, 1997 - December 8, 1998">{{cite web

On [[April 21]] and [[April 22]], [[1999]], Metallica recorded two performances with the [[San Francisco Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Michael Kamen]]. Kamen, who had previously worked with producer Rock on "[[Nothing Else Matters]]", approached the band in 1991 with the idea of pairing Metallica's music with a symphony orchestra. Kamen and his staff of over 100 composed additional orchestral material for Metallica songs. Metallica wrote two new Kamen-scored songs for the event, "[[No Leaf Clover]]" and "- Human". The audio recording and concert footage were released in 1999 as the album and concert film ''[[S&M (album)|S&M]]''. It entered the ''Billboard 200'' at number two, and the Australian ARIA charts and Top Internet Albums chart at number one.<ref name="Metallica Chart Positions"/>

=== Napster controversy (2000<U+2013>2001)===

In 2000, Metallica discovered that a [[Demo (music)|demo]] of its song "[[I Disappear]]", which was supposed to be released in combination with the [[Mission: Impossible II soundtrack|''Mission: Impossible II'' soundtrack]], was receiving radio airplay.

At the 2000 [[MTV Video Music Awards]], Ulrich appeared in a skit with host [[Marlon Wayans]] that blasted the idea of using Napster to share music. Marlon played a college student sitting in his dorm room listening to Metallica's "I Disappear". Ulrich walked in and asked for an explanation. On receiving Wayans' excuse that using Napster was just "sharing", Lars retorted that Marlon's idea of sharing was "borrowing things that were not yours without asking." He called in the Metallica road crew, who proceeded to confiscate all of Wayans' belongings, leaving him almost nude in an empty room. Napster creator [[Shawn Fanning]] responded later in the ceremony by presenting an award wearing a Metallica shirt, saying, "I borrowed this shirt from a friend.
