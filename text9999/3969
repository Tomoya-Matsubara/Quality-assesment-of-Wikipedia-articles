'''Julian''', also spelled '''Julien''', is a common male given name in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[United States]], [[Ireland]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[France]] (as Julien) and elsewhere. 

The name literally means, in [[Latin]], "belonging to [[Julius]]", hence its use for the [[Julian calendar|''Julian'' calendar]] introduced by [[Julius Caesar]].  Some families have taken it as a female name, possibly due to the influence of the French feminine form, [[Julienne]].
