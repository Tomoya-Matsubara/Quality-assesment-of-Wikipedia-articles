The narrative takes place over 90 days after the crash of [[Oceanic Airlines|Oceanic]] Flight&nbsp;815, on December 23, 2004.  The stranded crash survivors make contact with associates of [[Characters of Lost#Naomi Dorrit|Naomi Dorrit]] (played by [[Marsha Thomason]]) on a nearby freighter, but the survivors divide when they hear that those on the freighter may not be coming to rescue the survivors.  [[Flashforward]]s show the post-island lives of [[Hugo "Hurley" Reyes]] ([[Jorge Garcia]]) and [[Jack Shephard]] ([[Matthew Fox (actor)|Matthew Fox]]).  They are lying to the public about their time on the island.  In flashforwards, Hurley has visions of his deceased friend [[Charlie Pace]] ([[Dominic Monaghan]]); in the present, Hurley grieves over Charlie's death on the island.  [[Daniel Faraday]] ([[Jeremy Davies]]) makes his first appearance in "The Beginning of the End".<ref name=press/>

== Plot ==

After being knifed in the back by [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]] ([[Terry O'Quinn]]) in the [[Through the Looking Glass (Lost)|third season finale]], Naomi uses her satellite phone to call [[Characters of Lost#George Minkowski|George Minkowski]] ([[Fisher Stevens]]) on the freighter.  Before she dies, she tells him that her injury was an accident and to give her love to her sister.  Meanwhile, Hurley finds [[Characters of Lost#Jacob|Jacob]]'s cabin.  He looks through the window and sees [[Christian Shephard]] ([[John Terry (actor)|John Terry]]) in a rocking chair, before someone steps up to the glass, only the left eye visible.  Hurley runs away, but finds the cabin again<U+2014>in a different location.  He squeezes his eyes shut and when he opens them, the building is gone and Locke appears.<ref name=beginning>[[Damon Lindelof|Lindelof, Damon]] (writer), [[Carlton Cuse|Cuse, Carlton]] (writer) and [[Jack Bender|Bender, Jack]] (director), "The Beginning of the End".

[[Desmond Hume]] ([[Henry Ian Cusick]]) returns from the [[Dharma Initiative#Station ?: The Looking Glass|Looking Glass]], bearing Charlie's final message that the freighter offshore is not owned by [[Characters of Lost#Penny Widmore|Penny Widmore]] ([[Sonya Walger]]).  The survivors reunite at 815's cockpit.  Jack knocks Locke to the ground, takes his gun and pulls the trigger, but finds that the gun is not loaded because Locke had no intention of killing Jack [[Through the Looking Glass (Lost)|earlier that day]].  Locke tells the castaways that they are in great danger and leaves for the Barracks with Hurley, [[James "Sawyer" Ford]] ([[Josh Holloway]]), [[Claire Littleton]] ([[Emilie de Ravin]]) and her baby [[Characters of Lost#Aaron Littleton|Aaron]], [[Danielle Rousseau]] ([[Mira Furlan]]) and her captive [[Ben Linus]] ([[Michael Emerson]]), [[Alex (Lost)|Alex]] ([[Tania Raymonde]]) and her boyfriend [[Characters of Lost#Karl|Karl]] ([[Blake Bashoff]]), [[Characters of Lost#Minor Oceanic 815 crash survivors|Vincent]] the dog (Pono)<ref>Nichols, Katherine, (March 25, 2007) "[http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/03/25/features/story01.html Chewing the Scenery]", ''[[Honolulu Star Bulletin]]''.

Flashforwards show that Hurley is famous as one of the "[[Characters of Lost#Oceanic Six|Oceanic Six]]" after his escape from the island and is keeping quiet about his time there.  Hurley encounters an apparition of Charlie.  Shocked, he speeds away in his [[Camaro]] and is apprehended by Los Angeles police.<ref name=beginning/>  Hurley is interrogated by [[Ana Lucia Cortez]]'s ([[Michelle Rodriguez]]) former partner Detective [[Characters of Lost#Mike Walton|"Big" Mike Walton]] ([[Michael Cudlitz]]) and he lies that he has no knowledge of Ana Lucia.  Hurley, looking at the interrogation room's mirror glass, imagines seeing Charlie swimming in water until he breaks the glass and floods the room.  Hurley willingly returns to the [[Dave (Lost)|Santa Rosa Mental Health Institution]], where he is visited by [[Characters of Lost#Widmore and employees|Matthew Abaddon]] ([[Lance Reddick]]), who claims to be an attorney for [[Oceanic Airlines]].  When Abaddon fails to supply a [[business card]], he asks if ''they'' are still alive before stealthily exiting.  An apparition of Charlie appears who tells Hurley that "they" need him.  Finally, Hurley is visited by Jack, who is thinking of [[Through the Looking Glass (Lost)|growing a beard]].  Jack confirms that Hurley will not reveal the Oceanic Six's secrets.  Hurley apologizes for going with Locke and insists that they return to the island, but Jack refuses (which shows that these flashforwards occur before Jack's flashforwards).<ref name=beginning/>
