{{History of Greater Iran}}
In the 9th<U+2013>14th centuries, the northern [[Iran]]ian regions of [[Tabaristan]], [[Daylam]] and [[Gilan]], sandwiched between the [[Caspian Sea]] and the [[Alborz]] range, came under the rule of a number of [[Alid]] dynasties, espousing the [[Zaydi]] branch of [[Shi'ism]]. The first and most powerful Zaydi emirate was established in [[Tabaristan]] in 864 and lasted until 928. It was interrupted by [[Samanid]] occupation in 900, but restored in 914 by another Alid branch. The second period of the Alid emirate was plagued by internal dissensions and power struggles between the two branches, and ended in the second conquest of the region by the Samanids in 928. Subsequently, some of the soldiers and generals of the Alavids joined the Samanids, among them the founder of the [[Ziyarid]] dynasty, [[Mardavij]], and [['Imad al-Daula|Ali]], Hassan and Ahmad, the sons of Buya and founders of the [[Buyid]] dynasty.

Local Zaydi rulers survived in Daylam and Gilan until the 16th century.

{{further|Zaydis|History of Tabaristan}}
*[[Hasan ibn Zayd]], adopted the [[regnal name]] ''al-Da'i ila'l-Haqq'' (864<U+2013>884). He was forced to abandon Tabaristan briefly for [[Daylam]] in 869 and 874 due to invasions

*[[Muhammad ibn Zayd]], also adopted the regnal name ''al-Da'i ila'l-Haqq'' (884<U+2013>900). Rule in Tabaristan proper was usurped by [[Abu'l-Husayn Ahmad ibn Muhammad]] for a few months as Muhammad was in Gurgan at the time of Hasan's death. Tabaristan was overrun briefly by [[Rafi ibn Harthama]] in 891<U+2013>893, and in 900 Muhammad tried to conquer Khurasan, but was defeated and killed by the Samanids. The Samanids captured Tabaristan, and the Alavids fled to Daylam in exile (900-913).

*[[Hasan ibn Ali al-Utrush]], adopted the regnal name ''al-Nasir li'l-Haqq'' (914<U+2013>917). A [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husaynid]] from [[Medina]], he converted the [[Gilites]] and Daylamites to the Zaydi doctrine, recovered Tabaristan.

A Hasanid, he was the commander of the army under al-Utrush and named by the latter as his heir. His rule was challenged by al-Utrush's sons and their numerous supporters (the "Nasiris"), who seized power twice, briefly in 919 and again in 923. Regained the throne with the help of [[Makan ibn Kaki]], ruled until he was killed in battle with [[Asfar ibn Shiruya]].

*[[Ahmad ibn Hasan|Abu 'l-Husayn Ahmad ibn Hasan]], surnamed ''Nasir'' (919, 923). Reigned jointly with his brother in 919, thereafter reconciled himself with Abu Muhammad Hasan al-Da'i until 923, when he reigned briefly until his death.

*[[Ja'far ibn Hasan|Abu 'l-Qasim Ja'far ibn Hasan]], surnamed ''Nasir'' (919, 923<U+2013>925). Reigned jointly with his brother in 919 and from 923 until his death.

*[[Muhammad ibn Ahmad|Abu Ali Muhammad ibn Abu 'l-Husayn Ahmad]], surnamed ''Nasir''  (925<U+2013>927). Son of Ahmad ibn Hasan, he was chosen as emir after Ja'far died.

*[[Husayn ibn Ahmad|Abu Ja'far Husayn ibn Abu 'l-Husayn Ahmad]], surnamed ''Nasir''  (927). Brother of Abu Ali Muhammad, he was deposed by Makan ibn Kaki, who brought back Abu Muhammad Hasan al-Da'i.
