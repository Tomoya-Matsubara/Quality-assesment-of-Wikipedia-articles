{{Politics of the Netherlands}}
'''Elections in the Netherlands''' are held for six territorial levels of government: the [[European Union]], the state, the twelve [[Provinces of the Netherlands|Provinces]] of the [[Netherlands]], the 25 [[Water board (The Netherlands)|water board]]s, the 418 [[Municipalities in the Netherlands|municipalities]] (and the 3 ''public bodies'' in the [[Caribbean Netherlands]]) and in two cities ([[Amsterdam]] and [[Rotterdam]]) for neighbourhood councils ([[deelgemeente|stadsdeelraden]]). Apart from [[election]]s, [[referendum|referenda]] are also held occasionally, a fairly recent phenomenon in Dutch politics. The most recent national election results and an overview of the resulting seat assignments and coalitions since World War II are shown at the bottom of this page.

At the national level, [[legislature|legislative]] power is invested in the [[States-General of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|States-General]] (''Staten-Generaal''), which is [[bicameralism|bicameral]]. The [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] (''Tweede Kamer'') has 150 members, elected for a four-year term by [[proportional representation]]. Elections are also called after a dissolution of the House of Representatives. All elections are [[direct election|direct]], except for the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] (''Eerste Kamer''), which has 75 members, elected for a four-year term by provincial councillors on the basis of proportional representation at the provincial elections.

The Netherlands has a [[multi-party]] system, with numerous [[political parties|parties]], in which usually no one party ever secures an overall majority of votes (except occasionally in very small municipalities, such as in [[Tubbergen]]), so that several [[political parties|parties]] must cooperate to form a [[coalition government]]. This usually includes the party supported by a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of voters, with only three exceptions since World War II, in 1971, 1977 and 1982, when the [[Dutch Labour Party]] (PvdA) was the largest party but did not take part in the coalition.

Candidates to the elections of the House of Representatives are chosen from [[party list]]s according to a system of [[proportional representation]]. The threshold is 1/150th of the total number of valid votes.

During the municipal elections of 2006, elections were electronic throughout the country. As a result, results were known before the end of the day, a mere two hours after the closing of the poll stations. For the national elections in November of that same year, however, several polling stations decided to return to paper and red pencil because of security issues with the [[voting machine]]s. Since then, most elections have been held using paper and pencil.

The most recent election was the [[Dutch general election, 2012|general election]] on 12 September 2012.

==Timing==
The maximum parliamentary term is four years and elections are generally held about four years after the previous one. Normal elections, i.e. after the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] has fulfilled its term, take place in March. If municipal or provincial elections are already taking place in March of that year, the parliamentary elections are postponed to May. The elections are planned for spring to ensure that a new cabinet is formed in time to present its plans on the most important day in the Dutch Parliament, [[Prinsjesdag]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://statengeneraaldigitaal.nl/document?id=sgd:mpeg21:19841985:0007730&zoom=0.5&highlights=aan&pagina=12 |title=Kamerstuk Tweede Kamer 1984<U+2013>1985 kamerstuknummer 18807 ondernummer 2 |author=Tweede Kamer |publisher=Staten-Generaal Digitaal |page=12 |language=Dutch |accessdate=24 March 2011}}</ref>
If the House of Representatives is dissolved, due to a severe conflict between the House of Representatives and [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], or within the cabinet, new elections (called dissolution elections) take place as soon as possible, usually two months to give parties time to prepare. The term of the next House can be shortened or prolonged by almost a year to ensure the next normal elections again happen in March or May.

Municipal and provincial elections always take place every four years, in March; municipal elections always two years after a year divisible by four, and provincial elections one year after municipal elections. [[City council (Netherlands)|City council]]s and [[States-Provincial]] cannot be dissolved, so no dissolution elections can occur. An exception to the four-year term is made when two or more municipalities merge and new elections take place for the merged municipality.
Senate elections also take place every four years, in May following the provincial elections. The Senate can be dissolved, and subsequently dissolution elections take place, but since the States-Provincial remain the same, this seldom occurs. A Senate chosen by dissolution elections sits out the remainder of its predecessor's term.

Elections usually take place on Wednesdays, but the government can decide to change this to a Tuesday, Thursday or Friday if there are good reasons to do so (e.g. when the election day coincides with a national holiday). Elections for the European Parliament always take place on a Thursday.

==Eligibility==
Every Dutch citizen who has reached the age of 18 is eligible to vote (''actief kiesrecht'') or to stand for election as a member of the House of Representatives (''passief kiesrecht''). A notable exception is municipal elections, in which persons younger than 18 can be elected, although they may not take their seat until their 18th birthday. Also, for the municipal election one does not have to be Dutch; residents who are citizens of another EU country are also eligible to vote, as well as citizens of other countries who have lived (legally) in the Netherlands for five years. Someone may be deprived of these rights if they are mentally incapable of making a reasoned choice or have lost their right to vote by court sentence. Two weeks before an election all voters receive a card, which is the evidence that they are entitled to vote, and this card must be handed over at the polling-station before voting. As of 1970, voting is not compulsory.

It is not necessary or even possible specifically to register as a voter for elections in the Netherlands: every resident inhabitant of the Netherlands is required to register as such with the municipality in which they are living, and this data (which includes their nationality and date of birth) is the basis from which the electoral register is derived.

Dutch citizens who live abroad (and have deregistered themselves as a Dutch resident) are allowed to vote for the House of Representatives and for the European Parliament, but not for municipal or provincial elections. They do need to register themselves as a voter.

==System==
As described above, the House of Representatives is elected using an [[Open list|open party list]] system of proportional representation.

==Election==
[[Image:Stemmen2.jpg|thumb|Voting using "paper and red pencil": the voter colours in the box preceding the name of his or her favoured candidate]]
[[File:Voting at Dutch elections 1918.jpg|thumb|Voting at Dutch elections in 1918]]
[[File:Vote counting at Dutch elections 1913.jpg |thumb|Vote counting at Dutch elections in 1913]]

For all elections other than water board elections, polling is organized on the basis of municipalities. In each municipality there are multiple voting stations, usually in communal buildings, such as churches, schools, and more recently, railway stations. There are two different systems: using the call-to-vote card (''oproepkaart'') or a voting pass (''stempas''). With the ''oproepkaart'', voters may vote, using this card, only at their nearest voting station, or if lost, their identity card. With a ''stempas'', users may vote at any station in their municipality, but must have the pass with them. If it is lost, a replacement can be requested, but only until a few days before the elections. A ''stempas'' (of different type) can also be requested to vote in a different municipality.

When arriving at a voting station, voters hand in their card or pass to one of the three attendants of the voting station, who checks the card, cancels it, issues ballot papers to the voter, and directs him or her to the polling-booth.

Dutch citizens living abroad are able to vote by registering in advance and then using a postal vote.  The results are counted by the municipality of The Hague and included in its own results.  In 2006, they could vote over the internet via the [[Rijnland Internet Election System]], but in 2008 security concerns led to a law against Internet voting.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/978-3-642-03829-7_4}}</ref>

Voting is done in one of two ways: manually marking a ballot paper with a red pencil or electronically, using a [[voting machine]]. In 2005, almost all municipalities planned to abandon pencil-and-paper voting. However, serious doubts were raised over the inviolability of the computers used from potential vote tampering and electronic eavesdropping.<ref>[http://www.wijvertrouwenstemcomputersniet.nl Wij vertrouwen stemcomputers niet]. Wijvertrouwenstemcomputersniet.nl. Retrieved on 2014-03-10.</ref><ref>[http://www.eenvandaag.nl/index.php?module=PX_Story&func=view&cid=2&sid=31156 eenvandaag] news item on the voting computer security.</ref> This led to a run on foreign voting machines and reintroduction of the red pencil in some municipalities in 2006, occasionally using converted [[medical waste]] disposal containers as voting boxes.

==Post-election==
Polls close at 21:00 and the votes are counted immediately. For national elections, the first results usually come within the first five minutes after the polls are closed (from the municipalities with the fewest inhabitants, [[Schiermonnikoog (island and municipality)|Schiermonnikoog]] and [[Renswoude]]). The final results are generally known around midnight and semi-officially announced the next morning, after which the 150 seats are allocated. However, recounting over the course of the following days sometimes throws up minor shifts in the allocation of seats.

===Seat assignment===
<!-- This section according to Maurice de Hond in  'Hoe wij kiezen', except for the example calculations, where I (DirkvdM) applied this knowledge to specific cases -->
The [[constituency|electorate]] in the Netherlands during the last general elections in 2010 was 12,524,152, of whom 75% voted, resulting in 9,442,977 votes (of which 9,416,001 valid votes). With 150 seats, that means a quota of 62,773 votes per seat, the so-called [[Hare quota]]. Since the [[electoral threshold]] is equal to the quota, that is also the number of votes required to get one seat in the House of Representatives.

However, the way [[residual seat]]s are assigned, by using the [[D'Hondt method]], a [[highest averages method]], means that smaller parties are unlikely to get a residual seat, while larger parties have a bigger chance of getting one and may even get more than one. Firstly, numbers of seats are always rounded down, meaning there are always residual seats and parties that did not reach the quota do not get any seats (they do not take part in the following calculation). Next, the number of votes is divided by the assigned seats ''plus one''. The party with the highest resulting number then gets one extra seat. Next, the process is repeated, with the party that got the extra seat participating again, albeit with a number one higher because they got an extra seat (the calculation stays the same for the other parties, which got no extra seat). But later on in the process, that party may get another extra seat. And since there are many parties in the House of Representatives, this is not unlikely to happen.

For example, in 2003 (see table [[Dutch general election, 2003#National Summary|here]]), the three biggest parties each got two of the six residual seats, even the VVD (150*0.179=26.85, but they got 28 seats, representing 18.7% of the seats instead of 17.9%), whereas the Socialist Party got none (150*0.063 = 9.45, but they got only 9 seats, representing 6% of the seats instead of 6.3%).

When the largest party gets over 35% of the votes and is considerably bigger than the next biggest party, that party may even get as much as 3 or even 4 residual seats. This has, however, never happened. The percentage of votes for the biggest party is usually around 30% and rarely goes far beyond that. The largest result ever was at the [[Dutch general election, 1989|1989 elections]], when [[Christen-Democratisch App<U+00E8>l|CDA]] got 35.3% of the votes. Even then, however, CDA only got two residual seats because next biggest party (PvdA) had 31.9% of the votes. The biggest difference between the first and second party was at the [[Dutch general election, 2002|2002 elections]], the most dramatic elections in Dutch history, when especially [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]] lost many votes to [[Pim Fortuyn List|LPF]], which became second biggest after CDA with 17.0% of the votes. CDA, however, had only 27.9% of the votes and therefore still only got 2 residual seats.

Parties may, however, form an alliance (''lijstencombinatie''), in which case they participate in the above calculations as one party and get a bigger chance of gaining residual seats (or getting one in the first place). The division of those seats between ''those'' parties is, however, done in a different way, by using the [[largest remainder method]], which favours the smaller parties rather than the bigger ones if there is a considerable difference in size. But the overall advantage is greatest for small parties of comparable size.

===Assigning people to seats===
After seats are assigned to the parties, people have to be assigned to the seats. The Netherlands has 20 [[electoral district]]s, in each of them a party can use different lists. In theory, a party can place different candidates on each of the 20 different lists. However, it is usual that at least the candidate ranked first on the list is the same person throughout the country. It is even quite common that parties use the same list in every district, or vary only the last five candidates per district. Usually these five candidates are locally well known politicians, parties hope to attract extra votes with these candidates. However, because of their low position on the list, chances are low that these local candidates are elected.

The first step in the process of assigning people to the seats is calculating how many seats each of the different lists of a party gets, by adding the number of votes on each of the different lists together. If a party used the same list in more than one electoral district, these lists are seen as one list. Seat assignment to the different lists is done by using the [[largest remainder method]].

The second step is calculating which candidate received on his or her own more votes than 25% of the [[electoral quota]], by adding up all votes for a particular candidate on the different lists. These candidates are declared elected independent of the list order, and get one of the seats of the list where they received the most votes. If more candidates are elected on a list than the list received seats, the candidate with the lowest total number of votes is transferred to the list where he had his second best result.

As a third step, the remaining seats (if there are any) are assigned to the remaining candidates, based on their order on the list. When candidates are elected on more than one list in this way, the candidate gets the seat on the list where he or she received the most votes. This is continued until every seat is assigned. If one of these elected candidates later decides to leave parliament, then his seat is assigned to the next person on the list of the district he 'represents'.

An exception to the above exists in the form of ''[[lijstduwer]]'' ('list pushers'), famous people (former politicians, but also sports people) who are put on the candidate list but will not accept a seat when they get enough votes for one. During the municipal elections in 2006 professor Joop van Holsteyn criticised this practise, saying someone on a candidate list should also be a serious candidate. This view is shared by other politicologists, but less so by politicians, who say that lijstduwers are on the list not to get elected but to show that they support that party and that the fact that they are at the bottom of the list makes it obvious they are not intended to get a seat. Still, writer [[Ronald Giphart]] (1998) and skater [[Hilbert van der Duim]] (1994) got a [[city council]] seat, which Giphart refused to fill. Professor Rudy Andeweg says this is close to fraud because the law requires someone on the candidate list to declare in writing to be willing to fill a seat.

An example from the municipality of [[Oude IJsselstreek]]. The city council elections of 2010 resulted a total of 17.852 valid votes. The CDA party achieved 4.440 votes. Of the thirty CDA candidates on the list, 22 were given at least one vote each:<ref>[http://gemeente.oude-ijsselstreek.nl/nieuws/2010/03/04/uitslag_gemeenteraadsverkiezingen Gemeente Oude IJsselstreek], last seen 3 March 2010.</ref>

(The last number is the amount of personal votes.)

As the total number of votes in the municipality is 17,852 and the council has 27 seats, 661 votes count for one seat. As the CDA has 4,440 votes it is entitled to seven seats.

First, it has to be checked who of the CDA candidates has more than a quarter of the ''kiesdeler''. (661 divided by four makes 165 votes.) This is true for the candidates number 1, 3, 5, 4, 2 and 14 (in this order). Those six are elected.

Second, the rest of the CDA seats (one) is given to the person first on the list. As candidates number 1-5 already have seats, this last seat goes to number 6.

==Referendums==
In principle, national referendums in the Netherlands are not possible by law. However, from 2002 until 2005, there was a Temporary Referendum Law in place, which allowed for non-binding referendums, known in Dutch as ''Volksraadpleging'' ("People's Consultation"), to be organised for laws already approved by the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]]. No referendum was called based on this law.

In order to hold the [[Dutch European Constitution referendum, 2005|2005 referendum]] on the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]], a different law was temporarily put in place. That referendum was the first national referendum in the Netherlands since [[Batavian Republic constitutional referendum, 1805|1805 referendum in Batavian Republic]] and it was the result of an initiative proposal by parliamentarians [[Farah Karimi]] ([[GroenLinks|Greens]]), Niesco Dubbelboer ([[Dutch Labour Party|Labour]]) and Boris van der Ham ([[Democrats 66|Democrats]]).

==Other elections==

===Water boards===
Elections for the [[water board (Netherlands)|water board]]s have some similarities to other elections mentioned above, but also some distinctive differences. Similar to e.g. municipal elections, there are national parties and local parties, and the party list system is used with proportional representation. Residents of 18 and over can vote and elections take place every four years.

In contrast to other elections, not all members of the water board are chosen by the residents of the water board area. The members of each water board are divided into four categories: inhabitants, agriculture, nature and commercial. Only board members in the inhabitants category are chosen in direct elections, the members in the other categories are appointed by representing organisations, e.g. chambers of commerce in the industry category. Another difference is that voting does not take place in person, but only by post, over a period of about two weeks.

==Latest municipal elections==
The 2010 Dutch municipal election saw a success for the right-wing [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]], social-liberal [[Democrats 66|D66]] and local parties. The [[Party for Freedom|PVV]], the most right-wing party in the Dutch parliament, only participated in two municipalities, but had a big success by becoming the first and second biggest party respectively. [[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]], [[Dutch Labour Party|PvdA]] and [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|SP]] lost the most seats, but CDA still remained the largest party in total.<ref>[http://www.dutchpoliticalreport.com/2010/03/dutch-local-election-results-right-wing.html Dutch Local Election Results.
