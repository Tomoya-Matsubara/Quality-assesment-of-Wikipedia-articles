'''Atlanta''' ({{pron-en|<U+0259>t<U+02C8>l<U+00E6>nt<U+0259>}} or {{IPA-en|<U+00E6>t<U+02C8>l<U+00E6>nt<U+0259>|}}) is the [[capital (political)|capital]] and most populous city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

As of 2008, Atlanta is the [[List of United States cities by population|thirty-third largest city]] in the United States, with an estimated population of 537,958. Its [[metropolitan area]], officially named the [[Atlanta Metropolitan Area|Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Marietta, GA MSA]] (commonly referred to as '''Metropolitan Atlanta''') is the [[Table of United States Metropolitan Statistical Areas|ninth largest metropolitan area in the country]], inhabited by approximately 5.5 million people. Moreover, the [[Table of United States Combined Statistical Areas|Atlanta Combined Statistical Area]] has a population approaching 6 million, making it is the most populous metropolis in the [[Southeastern United States|American Southeast]] and the focal point of the emerging [[megalopolis]] known as the [[Piedmont Atlantic MegaRegion]]. Like most areas in the [[Sun Belt]], the Atlanta region has seen explosive growth in the past [[decade]], adding more than 1.13 million residents between 2000 and 2008. It is the fastest growing area of the [[United States]] behind the [[Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex]].<ref>www.economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/09/betting-on-atlanta</ref> Also in 2008, Atlanta became the eighth largest [[media market]] in the United States, with more than 2,387,520 households in its metropolitan area.<ref>http://www.tvb.org/rcentral/markettrack/us_hh_by_dma.asp</ref>

Atlanta is the county seat of [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]] and the fifth location for the [[seat of government]] of the state of Georgia. A small portion of the city of Atlanta corporate limits extends into [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]]. Residents of the city are known as Atlantans.<ref>The term "Atlantans" is widely used by both [http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2008/06/23/focus2.html local media] and [http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/weather/03/17/atlanta.tornado/index.html national media].</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Atlanta|Atlanta in the Civil War}}

The land constituting the city of Atlanta was once a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] village called Standing Peachtree. The land that became the Atlanta area was taken from the [[Cherokee]] and [[Creek (people)|Creeks]] by white settlers in 1822, with the first area settlement being [[Decatur, Georgia|Decatur]].
[[File:Peachtree1907.jpg|thumb|left|upright|In 1907, Peachtree Street, the main street of Atlanta, was busy with streetcars and automobiles.]]
On December 21, 1836, the [[Georgia General Assembly]] voted to build the [[Western and Atlantic Railroad]] to provide a trade route to the [[Midwestern United States]].<ref name=W&ARR>{{cite web | title = Creation of the Western and Atlantic Railroad | work = About North Georgia | publisher = Golden Ink | url = http://ngeorgia.com/railroads/warr01.html | accessdate = 2007-11-12}}</ref> Following the [[Trail of Tears|forced removal]] of the [[Cherokee Nation]] between 1838 and 1839 the newly depopulated area was opened for the construction of a railroad. The area around the eastern terminus to the line began to develop first, and so the settlement was named "Terminus" in 1837. It was nicknamed Thrasherville after [[John Thrasher]], who built homes and a general store there.<ref>[http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/gahistmarkers/thrashervillehistmarker.htm Thrasherville State Historical Marker], retrieved on 2009-11-13.</ref> By 1842, the settlement had six buildings and 30 residents and the town was renamed "Marthasville".<ref name=shorthistory>{{cite web | title = A Short History of Atlanta: 1782<U+2013>1859 | publisher = CITY-DIRECTORY, Inc. | date = 2007-09-22 | url = http://www.city-book.com/Overview/history/history1.htm | accessdate = 2007-12-01}}</ref> The Chief Engineer of the Georgia Railroad, [[J. Edgar Thomson]], suggested that the area be renamed "[[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantica]]-[[Pacific Ocean|Pacifica]]" after the [[Western and Atlantic Railroad]], which was quickly shortened to "Atlanta".<ref name=shorthistory/> The residents approved, and the town was incorporated as Atlanta on December 29, 1847.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ourgeorgiahistory.com/date/December_29|title=Georgia History Timeline Chronology for December&nbsp;29 | publisher = Our Georgia History |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref> By 1854, another railroad connected Atlanta to [[LaGrange, Georgia|LaGrange]], and the town grew to 9,554 by 1860.<ref>{{cite web | last = Storey | first = Steve | title = Atlanta & West Point Railroad | publisher = Georgia's Railroad History & Heritage | url = http://railga.com/atlwp.html | accessdate = 2007-09-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Atlanta Old and New: 1848 to 1868 | work = Roadside Georgia | publisher = Golden Ink | url = http://roadsidegeorgia.com/city/atlanta02.html | accessdate = 2007-11-13}}</ref>

During the [[American Civil War]], Atlanta served as an important railroad and military supply hub. In 1864, the city became the target of a [[Atlanta campaign|major Union invasion]]. The area now covered by Atlanta was the scene of several battles, including the [[Battle of Peachtree Creek]], the [[Battle of Atlanta]], and the [[Battle of Ezra Church]]. On September 1, 1864, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General [[John Bell Hood]] evacuated Atlanta after a four-month siege mounted by Union General [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]] and ordered all public buildings and possible Confederate assets destroyed. The next day, Mayor [[James Calhoun]] surrendered the city, and on September 7 Sherman ordered the civilian population to evacuate. He then ordered Atlanta burned to the ground on November 11 in preparation for his march south, though he spared the city's churches and hospitals.<ref name=shorthistory2>{{cite web | title = A Short History of Atlanta: 1860<U+2013>1864 | publisher = CITY-DIRECTORY, Inc. | date=  2007-09-22 | url = http://www.city-book.com/Overview/history/history2.htm | accessdate = 2007-12-01}}</ref>

The rebuilding of the city was gradual. From 1867 until 1888, U.S. Army soldiers occupied [[Fort McPherson|McPherson Barracks]] in southwest Atlanta to ensure [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction era]] reforms. To help the newly freed slaves, the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] worked in tandem with a number of freedmen's aid organizations, especially the American Missionary Association. In 1868, Atlanta became the fifth city to serve as the state capital.<ref>{{cite web | last = Jackson | first = Edwin L. | title = The Story of Georgia's Capitols and Capital Cities | publisher = Carl Vinson Institute of Government, University of Georgia | url = http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/capital.htm#anchor671763 | accessdate = 2007-11-13}}</ref> The Confederate [[Old soldiers' home|Soldiers' Home]] was built to house disabled and elderly Georgia veterans from 1901 to 1941.<ref>R.

Grady]], the editor of the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]'', promoted the city to investors as a city of the "New South", one built on a modern economy, less reliant on agriculture. However, as Atlanta grew, ethnic and racial tensions mounted. The [[Atlanta Race Riot]] of 1906 left at least 27 dead<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1906atlantaraceriot.org/|title=Atlanta Race Riot | publisher= The Coalition to Remember the 1906 Atlanta Race Riot |accessdate=2006-09-06}}</ref> and over 70 injured.

On December 15, 1939, Atlanta hosted the premiere of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', the movie based on Atlanta-born [[Margaret Mitchell]]'s best-selling [[Gone with the Wind|novel of the same name]]. Stars [[Clark Gable]], [[Vivien Leigh]], [[Olivia de Havilland]] and legendary producer [[David O. Selznick]] attended the gala, which was held at Loew's Grand Theatre, now destroyed. [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] had returned to England for the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngeorgia.com/ang/Atlanta_Premiere_of_Gone_With_The_Wind |title=Atlanta Premiere of Gone With The Wind |publisher=Ngeorgia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref> The reception was held at the [[Georgian Terrace Hotel]], which is still standing.

During [[World War II]], manufacturing such as the [[Bell Aircraft]] factory in the suburb of [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]] helped boost the city's population and economy. Shortly after the war, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] was founded in Atlanta.<ref>{{cite web | title = Commemorating CDC's 60th Anniversary | work = CDC Website | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) | url = http://www.cdc.gov/about/history/60th.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-18}}</ref>

In the wake of the landmark [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', which helped usher in the [[Civil Rights Movement]], racial tensions in Atlanta began to express themselves in acts of violence. On October 12, 1958, [[Bombing of the Hebrew Benevolent Congregation Temple|a Reform Jewish temple on Peachtree Street was bombed]]; the synagogue's rabbi, Jacob Rothschild, was an outspoken advocate of integration.<ref>{{cite book

In the 1960s, Atlanta was a major organizing center of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|Civil Rights Movement]], as Dr. Martin Luther King and students from Atlanta's historically black colleges and universities played major roles in the movement's leadership. Two of the most important civil rights organizations, the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] and the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], had their national headquarters in Atlanta.
Despite some racial protests during the Civil Rights era, Atlanta's political and business leaders labored to foster Atlanta's image as "the city too busy to hate". In 1961, Atlanta Mayor [[Ivan Allen Jr.]] became one of the few Southern white mayors to support desegregation of his city's public schools.<ref>{{cite journal

African-American Atlantans demonstrated growing political influence with election of the first African-American mayor in 1973. They became a majority in the city during the late 20th century but suburbanization, rising prices, a booming economy and new migrants have decreased their percentage in the city from a high of 69 percent in 1980 to about 54 percent in 2004. The addition of new immigrants such as Latinos and Asians is also altering city demographics, along with an influx of white residents.<ref name="nyt-031106">{{cite news | publisher=The New York Times | first=Shaila | last=Dewan | date=March 11, 2006 | title=Gentrification Changing Face of New Atlanta | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/11/national/11atlanta.html?ei=5090&en=bf1cb813a14f4341&ex=1299733200&adxnnl=0&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&adxnnlx=1142054955-6bzVsYXnlCDNwbMJEoswIg&pagewanted=all}}</ref>

In 1990, Atlanta was selected as the site for the [[1996 Summer Olympics]]. Following the announcement, Atlanta undertook several major construction projects to improve the city's parks, sports facilities, and transportation. Atlanta became the third American city to host the [[Summer Olympics]]. The games themselves were marred by numerous organizational inefficiencies, as well as the [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing]].<ref>{{cite web

The [[Eastern Continental Divide]] line enters Atlanta from the south, proceeding to the downtown area. From downtown, the divide line runs eastward along DeKalb Avenue and the [[CSX]] rail lines through Decatur.<ref name=divide>{{cite web | last = Yeazel | first = Jack | title = Eastern Continental Divide in Georgia | date= 2007-03-23 | url = http://www.gpsinformation.org/jack/Divide/Divide.html | accessdate = 2007-07-05}}</ref> Rainwater that falls on the south and east side runs eventually into the [[Atlantic Ocean]], while rainwater on the north and west side of the divide runs into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]<ref name=divide/> via the [[Chattahoochee River]]. That river is part of the [[ACF River Basin]], and from which Atlanta and many of its neighbors draw most of their water. Being at the far northwestern edge of the city, much of the river's natural habitat is still preserved, in part by the [[Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area]]. Downstream however, excessive water use during droughts and pollution during floods has been a source of contention and legal battles with neighboring states [[Alabama]] and [[Florida]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Florida, Alabama, Georgia water sharing | publisher = WaterWebster | date = | url = http://www.waterwebster.com/FloridaAlabamaGeorgia.htm | format = news archive | accessdate = 2007-07-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Fact Sheet&nbsp;<U+2013> Interstate Water Conflicts: Georgia&nbsp;<U+2014> Alabama&nbsp;<U+2014> Florida | publisher = Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce | date = | url = http://www.metroatlantachamber.com/macoc/initiatives/img/tri-statefactsheet.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-07-05}}</ref>

Unlike many other Southern cities such as [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]], and [[New Orleans]], Atlanta chose not to retain its historic Old South architectural characteristics. Instead, Atlanta viewed itself as the leading city of a progressive "New South" and opted for expressive modern structures.<ref>Craig (1995), p. 15</ref> Atlanta's skyline includes works by most major U.S. firms and some of the more prominent architects of the 20th century, including [[Michael Graves]], [[Richard Meier]], [[Marcel Breuer]], [[Renzo Piano]], Pickard Chilton, and soon, [[David Chipperfield]]. Atlanta's most notable hometown architect may be [[John Portman]] whose creation of the atrium hotel beginning with the [[Hyatt Regency Atlanta]] (1967) made a significant mark on the hospitality sector. Through his work, Portman<U+2014>a graduate of [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]]'s [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Architecture|College of Architecture]] -- reshaped downtown Atlanta with his designs for the [[Atlanta Merchandise Mart]], [[Peachtree Center]], the [[Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel]], and [[SunTrust Plaza]].

The city of Atlanta is seeing a unique and drastic demographic increase in its white population, and at a pace that outstrips the rest of the nation. The proportion of whites in the city's population, according to [[Brookings Institution]], grew faster between 2000 and 2006 than that of any other U.S. city. It increased from 31% in 2000 to 35% in 2006, a numeric gain of 26,000, more than double the increase between 1990 and 2000.  Only [[Washington, D.C.]] saw a comparable increase in white population share during those years.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gurwitt |first=Rob |url=http://www.governing.com/articles/0807atlanta.htm |title=Governing Magazine: Atlanta and the Urban Future, July 2008 |publisher=Governing.com |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref>

According to a 2000 daytime population estimate by the Census Bureau,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/daytime/daytimepop.html| title=Estimated Daytime Population| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| accessdate=2006-04-02| date=December 6, 2005}}</ref> over 250,000 more people commuted to Atlanta on any given workday, boosting the city's estimated daytime population to 676,431. This is an increase of 62.4% over Atlanta's resident population, making it the largest gain in daytime population in the country among cities with fewer than 500,000 residents.

According to census estimates, the city of Atlanta was the thirteenth fastest growing city in the nation, in terms of both percentage and numerical increase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/population/013960.html |title=US Census Press Releases |publisher=Census.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref>

Since the 1990s, the number of immigrants from Latin America to the Atlanta metropolitan area has greatly increased. This flow of immigrants has brought new cultural and religious practices and affect the economy and demography of the urban area, resulting in vibrant [[Hispanic and Latino Communities in Atlanta|Hispanic communities within the city.]]

Atlanta is also home to the fastest growing millionaire population in the United States. The number of households in Atlanta with $1 million or more in investable assets, not including primary residence and consumable goods, will increase 69% through 2011, to approximately 103,000 households.<ref>{{cite news

===Colleges and universities===
{{See also|List of colleges and universities in metropolitan Atlanta}}

Atlanta is home to one of the largest concentrations of colleges and universities in the country. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}The city has more than 30 institutions of [[higher education]], including the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], a premier research university that has been ranked among the nations top ten public universities since 1999 by US News and World Report, [[Georgia State University]], and Mercer University Atlanta's Cecil B. Day Graduate and Professional Studies campus. The city also hosts the [[Atlanta University Center]], the largest consortium of [[historically black colleges and universities]] in the country.

See [[List of airports in the Atlanta area]] for a more complete listing.

With a comprehensive network of freeways that radiate out from the city, Atlantans rely on their cars as the dominant mode of transportation in the region<ref>{{cite web  | title = Atlanta: Smart Travel Tips  | work = Fodor's  | publisher = Fodor's Travel  | url = http://www.fodors.com/miniguides/mgresults.cfm?destination=atlanta@15&cur_section=tra&pg=2  | accessdate = 2007-09-28}}</ref> Atlanta is mostly encircled by [[Interstate 285]], a [[beltway]] locally known as "the Perimeter" which has come to mark the boundary between the interior of the region and its surrounding [[suburb]]s.

[[File:MARTA - N3 Station.jpg|thumb|left|[[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority]] provides public transportation in Atlanta]]
[[File:downtownconnectoratlantaaerial.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Downtown Connector]]]]
Three major [[interstate highways]] converge in Atlanta; [[Interstate 20|I-20]] runs east to west across town, while I-75 runs from northwest to southeast, and I-85 runs from northeast to southwest.  The latter two combine to form the [[Downtown Connector]] (I-75/85) through the middle of the city.  The combined highway carries more than 340,000 vehicles per day.  The Connector is one of the ten most congested segments of interstate highway in the United States.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.forbes.com/2006/02/06/cx_bm_0207trafficslide_6.html?thisSpeed=6000| work=Worst City Choke Points | title= Atlanta, I-75 at I-85 | publisher=Forbes.com| accessdate=2006-04-02}}</ref> The intersection of I-85 and I-285 in [[Doraville, Georgia|Doraville]]&nbsp;<U+2013> officially called the [[Tom Moreland Interchange]], is known to most residents as [[Spaghetti Junction]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/traffic/roadwords.html| work=AJC Online | title= Atlanta Road Lingo | publisher=Atlanta Journal-Constitution| accessdate=2006-05-05}}</ref> Metropolitan Atlanta is approached by thirteen freeways.  In addition to the aforementioned interstates, [[I-575]], [[Georgia 400]], [[Georgia 141]], [[Interstate 675 (Georgia)|I-675]], [[Georgia 316]], [[I-985]], Stone Mountain Freeway ([[US 78]]), and Langford Parkway (SR 166) all terminate just within or beyond the Perimeter, with the exception of Langford Parkway, limiting the transportation options in the central city.

This strong automotive reliance has resulted in heavy [[traffic]] and contributes to Atlanta's [[air pollution]], which has made Atlanta one of the more polluted cities in the country.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Copeland  | first = Larry  | title = Atlanta pollution going nowhere  | work = USA TODAY  | publisher = Gannett Co.

Around 2008 the Atlanta metro area has ranked at or near the top of the longest average commute times in the U.S. Also, the Atlanta metro area has ranked at or near the top for worst traffic in the country.<ref>{{cite web | title = Atlanta traffic the worst in America | url = http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2008/04/28/daily97.html}}</ref>

Notwithstanding heavy automotive usage, Atlanta's [[rapid transit|subway]] system, operated by [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority]] (MARTA), is the [[List of United States Rapid Transit systems by Ridership|seventh busiest in the country]].<ref name=APTA>American Public Transportation Association, [http://www.apta.com/research/stats/ridership/riderep/documents/07q4hr.pdf Heavy Rail Transit Ridership Report], Fourth Quarter 2007.</ref> MARTA also operates a [[bus]] system within Fulton, DeKalb, Cobb and Gwinnett Counties. Clayton, Cobb, and Gwinnett counties each operate separate, autonomous transit authorities, using buses but no trains.

Atlanta has a reputation as being one of the most dangerous cities for pedestrians,<ref name="Bennett">{{cite web| last=Bennett | first=D.L. | coauthors=Duane D.

The proposed [[Beltline (Atlanta)|Beltline]] would create a greenway and public transit system in a circle around the city from a series of mostly abandoned rail lines. This rail [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] would also accommodate multi-use [[trails]] connecting a string of existing and new parks. In addition, there is a proposed [[streetcar]] project that would create a streetcar line along Peachtree Street from downtown to the Buckhead area, as well as possibly another East-West MARTA line.

Atlanta began as a railroad town and it still serves as a major rail junction, with several freight lines belonging to [[Norfolk Southern]] and [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] intersecting below street level in downtown. It is the home of major [[classification yard]]s for both railroads, Inman Yard on the NS and Tilford Yard on the CSX. Long-distance passenger service is provided by [[Amtrak]]'s [[Crescent (Amtrak)|Crescent train]], which connects Atlanta with many cities between New Orleans and New York. The [[Peachtree Station|Amtrak station]] is located several miles north of downtown&nbsp;<U+2014> and it lacks a connection to the MARTA rail system. An ambitious, long-standing proposal would create a Multi-Modal Passenger Terminal downtown, adjacent to Philips Arena and the Five Points MARTA station, which would link, in a single facility, MARTA bus and rail, intercity bus services, proposed commuter rail services to other Georgia cities, and Amtrak.

[[Greyhound Lines]] provides intercity bus service between Atlanta and many locations throughout the United States, Canada, and up to the Mexican border.
