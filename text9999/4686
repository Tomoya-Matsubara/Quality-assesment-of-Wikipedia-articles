The '''Australian Voluntary Hospital''' was a military hospital staffed by Australian expatriates in England that served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] between 1914 and 1916. For much of this time it was the only Australian presence on the Western Front.

==Origin==
When the [[First World War]] broke out in August 1914, Lady (Rachel) Dudley, the wife of the former [[Governor-General of Australia]], the [[William Humble Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley|Lord Dudley]], decided to create a hospital from Australian doctors and nurses who were in the United Kingdom.There relatively large numbers of these; while doctors and nurses could be trained in Australia, advanced qualifications still required a trip overseas.<ref name="JAWM"/>

Lady Dudley discussed her proposal with King [[George V]], and then with the [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], and the British Army's [[Director General Army Medical Services]], Sir [[Arthur Sloggett]], who authorised the hospital. The hospital was formally offered to the British government by the [[Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom]], Sir [[George Reid (Australian politician)|George Reid]] on 15 August 1914.<ref name="History, pp. 1-7">''The History of the Australian Voluntary Hospital'', manuscript, pp. 1-7, [[Australian War Memorial]]: 1 DRL 667 12/11/1147</ref> Volunteers responded to advertisements that Lady Dudley placed in English newspapers on 17 August 1914. Women doctors were not accepted, but women nurses were welcomed.<ref name="JAWM">{{cite journal |journal=Journal of the Australian War Memorial |month=April |year=1991 |issue=18 |pages=63<U+2013>65 |title=A Photographic Record of an Australian Nursing Sister |first=Pam |last=Ray |issn=0729 6274 }}</ref>

The Australian Voluntary Hospital was commanded by [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[William L'Estrange Eames]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|CB|VD}}, an officer in the [[Australian Army Medical Corps]] who had served in the [[South African War]], and was holidaying in England with his family at the time. He was unable to join the [[First Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF), which was not accepting enlistments outside Australia at the time.<ref name="Eames">{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last= Horner|first= David|authorlink= David Horner|year= 1981|volume=6 |id2=eames-william-lestrange-6076/text10403|title=Eames, William L'Estrange (1863<U+2013>1956)|accessdate= 12 July 2013 }}</ref> He was granted the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]]. Ida Greaves {{post-nominals|country=AUS|RRC}}, from [[Royal Newcastle Hospital]] was appointed [[matron]]. The hospital soon reached a strength of 120 staff, of whom 36 were nurses.<ref name="JAWM"/>

==Operations==
The Australian Voluntary Hospital assembled its personnel and equipment at a camp established on the grounds of the [[Ranelagh Club]], which had been loaned for the purpose.It departed for France on 29 August 1914 on [[Windham Wyndham-Quin, 5th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl|Lord Dunraven]]'s yacht "Greta", which had been accepted by the Admiralty as a transport for medical units,<ref name="History, pp. 1-7"/>  and opened at [[Le Havre]] on 5 September. The 100-bed hospital set up in a park under canvas, with a school and house close by rented for various facilities. It began receiving casualties from the [[Retreat from Mons]] the next day.<ref name="JAWM"/>

On 26 October 1914, the Australian Voluntary Hospital moved to [[Wimereux]], where it established a 200-bed hospital. The hospital was well-equipped, with motor ambulances donated by organisations in Australia, a pathology laboratory and the only X-ray unit in the area. A day after it opened on 29 October, it began receiving patients from the [[First Battle of Ypres]].<ref name="JAWM"/> Much of the unit's tents which accommodated the male personnel of the hospital were lost in a blizzard on 11 November 1914, and the men moved to the Golf club house of the ''H<U+00F4>tel du Golf et Cosmopolite'' in Wimereux, which was eventually leased by the hospital, and became its officers' mess.<ref name="History, pp. 1-7"/>

For a time, the Australian Voluntary Hospital was the only Australian presence on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], but in April 1916, Australian Army units began arriving from the Middle East in large numbers. The Australian Voluntary Hospital's site in Wimereux was taken over by No. 2 Australian General Hospital, AIF in June 1916. The Australian Voluntary Hospital was then absorbed into the [[British Army]] as No. 32 Stationary Hospital, with Eames remaining in command.<ref name="JAWM"/> By 1 May 1919, the hospital had treated 73,868 patients.<ref name="History, pp. 1-7"/>
