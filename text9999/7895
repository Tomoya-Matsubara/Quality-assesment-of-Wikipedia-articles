A '''virus''' (from the [[Latin]] ''virus'' meaning ''[[toxin]]'' or ''[[poison]]'') is a [[Optical microscope#Limitations of light microscopes|sub-microscopic]] infectious agent that is unable to grow or reproduce outside a [[host (biology)|host]] [[cell (biology)|cell]]. Viruses infect all cellular life. The first known virus, [[tobacco mosaic virus]], was discovered by [[Martinus Beijerinck]] in 1899,<ref name="pmid18446425">{{cite journal

}}</ref> and now more than 5,000 types of virus have been described.<ref>Dimmock p. 49</ref> The study of viruses is known as [[virology]], and is a branch of [[microbiology]].

Viruses consist of two or three parts: all viruses have [[gene]]s made from either [[DNA]] or [[RNA]], long [[molecule]]s that carry genetic information; all have a [[protein]] coat that protects these genes; and some have an [[viral envelope|envelope]] of fat that surrounds them when they are outside a cell. Viruses vary in shape from simple [[tobacco mosaic virus|helical]] and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] shapes, to more [[bacteriophage|complex]] structures. They are about 100 times smaller than [[bacteria]].<ref name="Collier3355">Collier pp. 33<U+2013>55</ref> The origins of viruses are unclear: some may have evolved from [[plasmid]]s<U+2014>pieces of DNA that can move between cells<U+2014>while others may have evolved from bacteria.

Viruses spread in many ways; different [[species]] of virus use different methods. For example, plant viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on [[sap]], such as [[aphid]]s, while animal viruses can be carried by [[Hematophagy|blood-sucking]] insects. These disease-bearing organisms are known as [[vector (biology)|''vector]]s''. [[influenza|Influenza viruses]] are spread by coughing and sneezing, and others such as [[norovirus]], are transmitted by the [[fecal-oral route|faecal-oral route]], when they contaminate hands, food or water. [[Rotavirus]] is often spread by direct contact with infected children. [[HIV]] is one of several viruses that are transmitted through sex.

Not all viruses cause disease, as many viruses reproduce without causing any obvious harm to the infected organism. Some viruses such as HIV can cause life-long or [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] infections, and the viruses continue to replicate in the body despite the hosts' defence mechanisms. However, viral infections in animals usually cause an [[immune system|immune response]], which can completely eliminate a virus. These immune responses can also be produced by [[vaccine]]s that give lifelong [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to a viral infection. Microorganisms such as bacteria also have defences against viral infection, such as [[restriction modification system]]s. [[Antibiotic]]s have no effect on viruses, but [[antiviral drug]]s have been developed to treat life-threatening infections.

==History==
In 1884, the French [[microbiologist]] [[Charles Chamberland]] invented a filter, (known today as the [[Chamberland filter]] or Chamberland-Pasteur filter), with pores smaller than bacteria. Thus, he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution.<ref>Shors pp. 76<U+2013>77</ref> In 1892 the Russian biologist [[Dimitri Ivanovski]] used this filter to study what is now known to be [[tobacco mosaic virus]]. His experiments showed that the crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants are still infectious after filtration. Ivanovski suggested the infection might be caused by a toxin produced by bacteria, but did not pursue the idea.<ref>Collier p. 3</ref> At the time it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium<U+2014>this was part of the [[germ theory]] of disease.<ref>Dimmock p. 4</ref>  In 1899 the Dutch microbiologist [[Martinus Beijerinck]]  repeated the experiments and became convinced that this was a new form of infectious agent.<ref>Dimmock p.4<U+2013>5 </ref> He went on to observe that the agent multiplied only in dividing cells, but as his experiments did not show that it was made of particles, he called it a ''contagium vivum fluidum'' (soluble living germ) and re-introduced the word ''virus''.<ref name="Collier3">Collier p. 3</ref> Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature, a theory later discredited by [[Wendell Stanley]], who proved they were particulate.<ref name="Collier3"/> In the same year, 1899, [[Friedrich Loeffler]] and Frosch passed the agent of [[foot and mouth disease]] ([[aphthovirus]]) through a similar filter and ruled out the possibility of a toxin because of the high dilution; they concluded that the agent could replicate.<ref name="Collier3"/> 

In the early 20th century, the English bacteriologist [[Frederick Twort]] discovered the viruses that infect bacteria, which are now called [[bacteriophages]],<ref>Shors p. 589</ref> and the French-Canadian microbiologist [[F<U+00E9>lix d'Herelle]] described viruses that, when added to bacteria growing on [[agar]], would produce areas of dead bacteria. He accurately diluted a suspension of these viruses and discovered that the highest dilutions, rather than killing all the bacteria, formed discrete areas of dead organisms. Counting these areas and multiplying by the dilution factor allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the suspension.<ref>D'Herelle F (September 2007). "On an invisible microbe antagonistic toward dysenteric bacilli": brief note by Mr. F. D'Herelle, presented by Mr. Roux. 1917. ''Res. Microbiol.'' 158(7):553<U+2013>4. Epub 2007 Jul 28. PMID 17855060</ref>

By the end of the nineteenth century, viruses were defined in terms of their infectivity, filterability, and their requirement for living hosts. Viruses had only been grown in plants and animals. In 1906, Harrison invented a method for growing [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] in [[lymph]], and, in 1913, E. Steinhardt, C. Israeli and R. A. Lambert used this method to grow [[vaccinia]] virus in fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue.<ref>Steinhardt, E; Israeli, C;  and  Lambert, R.A.  (1913) "Studies on the cultivation of the virus of vaccinia" ''J.  Inf Dis. 13, 294<U+2013>300</ref> In 1928, H. B. Maitland and M. C. Maitland grew vaccinia virus in suspensions of minced hens' kidneys.  Their method was not widely adopted until the 1950s, when [[poliovirus]] was grown on a large scale for vaccine production.<ref>Collier p. 4</ref>

Another breakthrough came in 1931, when the American pathologist [[Ernest William Goodpasture]] grew influenza and several other viruses in fertilised chickens' eggs.<ref> Goodpasture EW, Woodruff AM, Buddingh GJ (1931). "The cultivation of vaccine and other viruses in the chorioallantoic membrane of chick embryos". ''Science'' 74, pp. 371<U+2013>372 PMID 17810781</ref> In 1949 [[John F. Enders]], [[Thomas Huckle Weller|Thomas Weller]] and [[Frederick Robbins]]  grew polio virus in cultured human embryo cells, the first virus to be grown without using solid animal tissue or eggs. This work enabled [[Jonas Salk]] to make an effective polio vaccine.<ref>Rosen FS (2004). "Isolation of poliovirus<U+2014>John Enders and the Nobel Prize". ''New England Journal of Medicine'', 351, pp. 1481<U+2013>83 PMID 15470207</ref>

With the invention of [[electron microscopy]] in 1931 by the German engineers [[Ernst Ruska]] and [[Max Knoll]] came the first images of viruses.<ref>From ''Nobel Lectures, Physics 1981<U+2013>1990'', (1993) Editor-in-Charge Tore Fr<U+00E4>ngsmyr, Editor G<U+00F6>sta Eksp<U+00E5>ng, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore.
*In 1887, Buist visualised one of the largest, Vaccinia virus, by optical microscopy after staining it. Vaccinia was not known to be a virus at that time. (Buist J.B. ''Vaccinia and Variola: a study of their life history'' Churchill, London)</ref> In 1935 American biochemist and virologist Wendell Stanley examined the Tobacco mosaic virus and found it to be mostly made from protein.<ref>Stanley WM, Loring HS (1936).

"Disintegration of tobacco mosaic virus in urea solutions". ''Science'' 89, pp. 345<U+2013>347 PMID 17788438</ref>
Tobacco mosaic virus was the first one to be [[crystal]]lised and whose structure could therefore be elucidated in detail. The first [[X-ray diffraction]] pictures of the crystallised virus were obtained by Bernal and Fankuchen in 1941. Based on her pictures, [[Rosalind Franklin]] discovered the full structure of the virus 1955.<ref name="pmid18702397">{{cite journal

*'''Regressive theory''': Viruses may have once been small cells that [[parasitism|parasitised]] larger cells. Over time, genes not required by their parasitism were lost. The bacteria [[rickettsia]] and [[Chlamydia (bacterium)|chlamydia]] are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells. They lend credence to this theory, as their dependence on parasitism is likely to have caused the loss of genes that enabled them to survive outside a cell. This is also called the ''degeneracy theory''.<ref name="Dimmock16">Dimmock p. 16</ref><ref>Collier p. 11</ref>

*'''Cellular origin theory''' (sometimes called the ''vagrancy theory''):<ref name="Dimmock16"/><ref>Collier pp. 11<U+2013>12</ref>  Some viruses may have evolved from bits of DNA or RNA that "escaped" from the genes of a larger organism. The escaped DNA could have come from [[plasmid]]s<U+2014>pieces of naked DNA that can move ''between'' cells or [[transposons]]. These are molecules of DNA that replicate and move around to different positions ''within'' the genes of the cell.<ref>Shors p. 574</ref> Once called "jumping genes", these are examples of [[mobile genetic elements]] and could be the origin of some viruses.

However, they have characteristics which are common to  several viruses and are often called subviral agents.<ref>Dimmock p. 55</ref> Viroids are important pathogens of plants.<ref>Shors 551<U+2013>3</ref> They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication.<ref name="pmid18764915">{{cite journal

Computer analysis of viral and host DNA sequences is giving a better understanding of the evolutionary relationships between different viruses and may help identify the ancestors of modern viruses. To date, such analyses have not helped to decide on which of the theories are correct. However, it seems unlikely that all currently known viruses have a common ancestor and viruses have probably arisen numerous times in the past by one or more mechanisms.<ref>Dimmock pp. 15<U+2013>16</ref>

Opinions differ on whether viruses are a form of life, or organic structures that interact with living organisms.  They have been described as "organisms at the edge of life",<ref>Rybicki EP (1990) "The classification of organisms at the edge of life, or problems with virus systematics."

However, although they have genes, they do not have a cellular structure, which is often seen as the basic unit of life.  Additionally, viruses do not have their own [[metabolism]], and require a host cell to make new products.  They therefore cannot reproduce outside a host cell (though bacterial species such as rickettsia and chlamydia are considered living organisms despite the same limitation).  Accepted forms of life use [[cell division]] to reproduce, whereas viruses spontaneously assemble within cells, which is analogous to the autonomous growth of [[crystallization|crystals]].

[[Image:Hexon.png|left|thumb|Diagram of how a virus capsid can be constructed using  multiple copies of just two protein molecules]]
Viruses display a wide diversity of shapes and sizes, called ''[[morphology (biology)|morphologies]]''. Viruses are  about 100 times smaller than bacteria.  Most viruses which have been studied have a  diameter between 10 and 300 [[nanometres]]. Some [[filovirus]]es have a total length of up to 1400&nbsp;nm, however their  diameters are only about 80&nbsp;nm.<ref name="Collier3355"/> Most viruses are unable to be seen with a [[light microscope]] so scanning and transmission [[electron microscope]]s are used to visualise virus particles.<ref>Collier pp. 33<U+2013>37</ref> To increase the contrast between viruses and the background, electron-dense "stains" are used. These are solutions of salts of heavy metals such as [[tungsten]], that scatter the electrons from regions covered with the stain. When virus particles are coated with stain (positive staining), fine detail is obscured. [[Negative staining]] overcomes this problem by staining the background only.<ref name="pmid1715774">{{cite journal

A complete virus particle, known as a virion, consists of [[nucleic acid]] surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a capsid. These are formed from identical protein subunits called capsomers.<ref>Collier p. 40</ref> Viruses can have a [[lipid]] "envelope" derived from the host [[cell membrane]].

}}</ref> Virally coded protein subunits will self-assemble to form a capsid, generally requiring the presence of the virus genome. However, complex viruses code for proteins which assist in the construction of their capsid. Proteins associated with nucleic acid are known as [[nucleoprotein]]s, and the association of viral capsid proteins with viral nucleic acid is called a nucleocapsid. In general, there are four main morphological virus types:

===Helical===
[[Image:TMV Structure.png|left|thumb|upright|Diagram of the structure of tobacco mosaic virus: the viral RNA is coiled inside the helix formed by repeating protein sub-units]]
Helical capsids are composed of a single type of capsomer stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure which may have a central cavity, or hollow tube. This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions: these can be  short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material, generally single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases, is bound into the protein helix, by interactions between the negatively-charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, the length of a helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomers. The well-studied Tobacco mosaic virus is an example of a helical virus.<ref>Collier p. 37</ref>

===Icosahedral===
[[Image:Icosahedral Adenoviruses.jpg|thumb|Electron micrograph of icosahedral viruses ([[adenovirus]])]]
Most animal viruses are icosahedral or near-spherical with icosahedral symmetry. A regular icosahedron is the optimum way of forming a closed shell from identical sub-units. The minimum number of identical capsomers required is  twelve, each composed of five identical sub-units. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than twelve capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. Capsomers at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomers and are called pentons. Capsomers on the triangular faces are surround by six others and are call hexons.<ref>Collier pp. 40, 42</ref>

===Enveloped===
[[Image:Varicella (Chickenpox) Virus PHIL 1878 lores.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Electron micrograph of negatively-stained herpes zoster virus<U+2014>note the envelope around the virus particle]]
Some species of viruses envelope themselves in a modified form of one of the [[cell membranes]], either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell, or internal membranes such as nuclear membrane or [[endoplasmic reticulum]], thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope. This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present are entirely host-coded. The influenza virus and HIV use this strategy. Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the envelope for their infectivity.<ref>Collier pp. 42<U+2013>43</ref>

===Complex===
[[Image:Phage.png|thumb|upright|The structure of a typical bacteriophage]]
These viruses possess a capsid which is neither purely helical, nor purely icosahedral, and which may possess extra structures such as protein tails or a complex outer wall. Some bacteriophages have a complex structure consisting of an icosahedral head bound to a helical tail which may have a hexagonal base plate with protruding protein tail fibres.

The poxviruses are large, complex viruses which have an unusual [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. The viral genome is associated with proteins within a central disk structure known as a [[nucleoid]]. The nucleoid is surrounded by a membrane and two lateral bodies of unknown function. The virus has an outer envelope with a thick layer of protein studded over its surface. The whole particle is slightly [[pleiomorphic]], ranging from ovoid to brick shape.<ref name="pmid4322005">{{cite journal

An enormous variety of genomic structures can be seen among viral species; as a group they contain more structural genomic diversity than the entire kingdoms of either plants, animals, or bacteria. 
A virus has either DNA or RNA genes and are called DNA viruses and RNA viruses respectively. By far most viruses have RNA. Plant viruses tend to have single-stranded RNA and bacteriophages tend to have double-stranded DNA.<ref name="Collier9699">Collier pp. 96<U+2013>99</ref>

Viral genomes are circular, such as [[polyomavirus]]es, or linear, such as [[Adenoviridae|adenoviruses]]. The type of nucleic acid is irrelevant to the shape of the genome. Among RNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts within the virion and is called ''segmented''. Each segment often codes for one protein and they are usually found together in one capsid. Every segment is not required to be in the same virion for the overall virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by the [[brome mosaic virus]].<ref>Collier pp. 33<U+2013>55</ref>

A viral genome, irrespective of nucleic acid type, is either single-stranded or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. Some viruses, such as those belonging to the ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'', contain a genome which is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.<ref name="Collier9699"/>

For viruses with RNA or single-stranded DNA, the strands are said to be either [[positive-sense]] (called the plus-strand) or [[negative-sense]] (called the minus-strand), depending on whether it is complementary to the viral [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is identical to viral mRNA and thus can be immediately [[translation (genetics)|translated]] by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an [[RNA polymerase]] before translation. DNA nomenclature is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that the ''coding strand'' for the viral mRNA is complementary to it (&minus;), and the ''non-coding strand'' is a copy of it (+).<ref name="Collier9699"/>

Genome size  varies greatly between species. The smallest viral genomes code for only four proteins and weigh about 10<sup>6</sup> [[Atomic mass unit|Daltons]]; the largest weigh about 10<sup>8</sup> Daltons and code for over one hundred proteins.<ref name="Collier9699"/> RNA viruses generally have smaller genome sizes than DNA viruses due to a higher error-rate when replicating, and have a maximum upper size limit. Beyond this limit, errors in the genome when replicating render the virus useless or uncompetitive. To compensate for this, RNA viruses often have segmented genomes where the genome is split into smaller molecules, thus reducing the chance of error. In contrast, DNA viruses generally have larger genomes due to the high fidelity of their replication enzymes.<ref>Pressing J, Reanney DC (1984). "Divided genomes and intrinsic noise". ''J Mol Evol''. 20(2):135<U+2013>46.</ref>

===Genetic change===
[[Image:Influenza geneticshift.jpg|thumb|upright|How antigenic shift, or reassortment, can result in novel and highly pathogenic strains of human influenza]]
Viruses undergo genetic change by several mechanisms. These include a process called [[genetic drift]] where individual bases in the DNA or RNA [[mutate]] to other bases. Most of these [[point mutations]] are silent in that they do not change the protein that the gene encodes, but others can confer evolutionary advantages such as resistance to [[antiviral drugs]].<ref name="pmid17927612">{{cite journal

Segmented genomes confer evolutionary advantages; different strains of a virus with a segmented genome can shuffle and combine  genes  and produce progeny viruses or (offspring) that have unique characteristics. This is called reassortment or ''viral sex''.<ref> Goudsmit, Jaap. Viral Sex. Oxford Univ Press, 1998.ISBN-13: 9780195124965 ISBN-10: 0195124960</ref> 

[[Genetic recombination]] is the process by which a strand of DNA is broken and then joined to the end of a different DNA molecule. This can occur when viruses infect cells simultaneously and studies of [[viral evolution]] have shown that recombination has been rampant in the species studied.<ref name="pmid10573145">{{cite journal

==Replication==
Viral populations do not grow through cell division, because they are acellular; instead, they use the machinery and metabolism of a host cell to produce multiple copies of themselves, and they ''assemble'' in the cell.
===Replication cycle===
[[Image:HepC replication.png|thumb|200px|A typical virus replication cycle]]
The [[viral life cycle|life cycle of viruses]] differs greatly between species but there are six ''basic'' stages in the life cycle of viruses:<ref>Collier pp. 75<U+2013>91</ref>

*''Attachment'' is a specific binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host range of a virus. For example, HIV infects only human [[T cells]], because its surface protein, [[gp120]], can interact with [[CD4]] and receptors on the T cell's surface. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral-envelope protein to undergo changes that results in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes.
*''Penetration'' follows attachment; viruses enter the host cell through receptor mediated [[endocytosis]] or membrane fusion. This is often called [[viral entry]]. The infection of plant cells is different that of animal cells. Plants have a rigid cell wall made of [[cellulose]] and viruses can only get inside the cells following trauma to the cell wall.<ref>Dimmock p. 70</ref> Viruses such as tobacco mosaic virus can also move directly in plants, from cell-to-cell, through pores called [[plasmodesma]]ta.<ref>|{{cite journal |author=Boevink P, Oparka KJ |title=Virus-host interactions during movement processes |journal=Plant Physiol. |volume=138 |issue=4 |pages=1815<U+2013>21 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16172094 |pmc=1183373 |doi=10.1104/pp.105.066761 |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=16172094}}</ref> Bacteria, like plants, have  strong cell walls which a virus must breach to infect the cell. Some viruses have evolved mechanisms which inject their genome into the bacterial cell while the viral capsid remains outside.<ref>Dimmock p. 71</ref>
[[Image:Phage injecting its genome into bacterial cell.png|right|thumb|200px|upright|Some bacteriophages inject their genomes into bacterial cells]]
*''Uncoating'' is a process in which the viral capsid is degraded by viral [[enzymes]] or host enzymes thus releasing the viral genomic nucleic acid.
*''Replication'' involves synthesis of viral messenger RNA (mRNA) for viruses except positive sense RNA viruses (see above), viral [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]] and assembly of viral proteins and viral genome replication.
*Following the ''assembly'' of the virus particles post-translational modification of the viral proteins often occurs. In viruses such as HIV, this modification, (sometimes called maturation), occurs ''after'' the virus has been released from the host cell.<ref name="pmid11451488">{{cite journal

}}</ref>
*Viruses are ''released'' from the host cell by [[lysis]]<U+2014>a process that kills the cell by bursting its membrane. Enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV) typically are released from the host cell by [[viral shedding|budding]]. During this process, the virus acquires its  envelope which is derived form the host's cell membrane.

====DNA viruses====
The genome replication of most DNA viruses takes place in the cell's [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell by fusion with the cell membrane or by endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery. The viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery.<ref>Shors p. 54</ref><ref>Collier p. 78</ref>

====RNA viruses====
RNA viruses are unique because their genetic information is encoded in RNA. Replication usually takes place in the [[cytoplasm]]. RNA viruses can be placed into about four different groups depending on their modes of replication. The [[Sense (molecular biology)|polarity]] (whether or not it can be used directly to make proteins) of the RNA largely determines the replicative mechanism, and whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. RNA viruses use their own [[RNA replicase]] enzymes to create copies of their genomes.<ref>Collier p. 79</ref>

====Reverse transcribing viruses====
{{main|Retrovirus}}
[[Reverse transcribing viruses]] replicate using reverse transcription, which is the formation of DNA from an RNA template. Reverse transcribing viruses containing RNA genomes use a DNA intermediate to replicate, whereas those containing DNA genomes use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use the reverse transcriptase]] enzyme to carry out the nucleic acid conversion. Retroviruses often integrate the DNA produced by [[reverse transcription]] into the host genome. They are susceptible to [[antiviral drug]]s that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. [[zidovudine]] and [[lamivudine]]. An example of the first type is HIV which is a retrovirus. Examples of the second type are the ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'', which includes  Hepatitis B virus.<ref>Collier pp. 88<U+2013>89</ref>

==Classification==
{{main|Virus classification}}
Classification seeks to describe the diversity of viruses by naming and grouping them based on similarities. In 1962, [[Andr<U+00E9> Lwoff]], [[Robert Horne]], and [[Paul Tournier]] were the first to develop a means of virus classification, based on the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean]] hierarchical system.<ref name="pmid14467544">{{cite journal

===ICTV classification===
The [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) developed the current classification system and wrote guidelines that put a greater weight on certain virus properties to maintain family uniformity. A universal system for classifying viruses, and a unified taxonomy, has been established since 1966. The 7th lCTV Report formalised for the first time the concept of the virus species as the lowest taxon (group) in a branching hierarchy of viral taxa.<ref>Fields  p. 27
*As defined therein, "a virus species is a polythetic class of viruses that constitute a replicating lineage and occupy a particular ecological niche". A <U+201C>polythetic" class is one whose members have several properties in common, although they do not necessarily all share a single common defining one. Members of a virus species are defined collectively by a consensus group of properties. Virus species thus differ from the higher viral taxa, which are <U+201C>universal<U+201D> classes and as such are defined by properties that are necessary for membership.</ref> However, at present only a small part of the total diversity of viruses has been studied, with [[genome]]ic analyses of samples from humans finding that about 20% of the virus sequences recovered have not been seen before, and samples from the environment, such as from seawater and ocean sediments, finding that the large majority of sequences are completely novel.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Delwart EL |title=Viral metagenomics |journal=Rev. Med. Virol. |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=115<U+2013>31 |year=2007 |pmid=17295196 |doi=10.1002/rmv.532}}</ref>

The general taxonomic structure is as follows:

:[[Order (biology)|Order]] (-virales)
::[[Family (biology)|Family]] (-viridae)
:::[[Subfamily]] (-virinae)
::::[[Genus]] (''-virus'')
:::::[[Species]] (''-virus'')

In the current (2008) ICTV taxonomy, five orders have been established, the Caudovirales, Herpesvirales, Mononegavirales, Nidovirales, and Picornavirales. The committee does not formally distinguish between [[subspecies]], [[Strain (biology)|strains]], and [[Primary isolate|isolates]]. In total there are 5 orders, 82 families, 11 subfamilies, 307 genera, 2,083 species and about 3,000 types yet unclassified.<ref>[http://www.ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp?version=2008 Virus Taxonomy 2008.]  International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.

The Baltimore classification of viruses is based on the mechanism of [[mRNA]] production. Viruses must generate  mRNAs from their genomes to produce proteins and replicate themselves, but different mechanisms are used to achieve this in each virus family. Viral genomes may be single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds), RNA or DNA, and may or may not use [[reverse transcriptase]] (RT). Additionally, ssRNA viruses may be either [[sense (molecular biology)|sense]] (+) or antisense (-). This classification places viruses into seven groups:

{{Baltimore groups}}

As an example of viral classification, the [[chicken pox]] virus, [[varicella zoster]] (VZV), belongs to the order Herpesvirales, family ''[[Herpesviridae]]'', subfamily ''[[Alphaherpesvirinae]]'', and genus ''[[Varicellovirus]]''. VZV is in Group I of the Baltimore Classification because it is a dsDNA virus that does not use reverse transcriptase.

==Viruses and human disease==
{{See|Table of clinically important viruses}}

Examples of common human diseases caused by viruses include the [[common cold]], influenza, [[chickenpox]] and [[cold sores]]. Many serious diseases such as [[ebola]], [[AIDS]], [[avian influenza]] and [[SARS]] are caused by viruses. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is described in terms of [[virulence]]. Other diseases are under investigation as to whether they too have a virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between [[Human Herpesvirus Six|human herpes virus six]] (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[chronic fatigue syndrome]]. There is current controversy over whether the [[borna virus]], previously thought to cause [[neurology|neurological]] diseases in horses, could be responsible for [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] illnesses in humans.<ref name=Chen_1999>{{cite journal

[[Image:Child with chickenpox.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A child with chickenpox]]
Viruses have different mechanisms by which they produce disease in an organism, which largely depends on the viral species. Mechanisms at the cellular level primarily include cell lysis, the breaking open and subsequent death of the cell. In [[multicellular organism]]s, if enough cells die the whole organism will start to suffer the effects. Although viruses cause disruption of healthy [[homeostasis]], resulting in disease, they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism. An example would include the ability of the [[herpes simplex virus]], which cause cold sores, to remain in a dormant state within the human body. This is called latency<ref name="pmid17686862">{{cite journal

[[Horizontal transmission]] is the most common mechanism of spread of viruses in populations. Transmission can be exchange of blood by sexual activity, e.g. HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C; by mouth by exchange of saliva, e.g. Epstein-Barr virus, or from contaminated food or water, e.g. norovirus; by breathing in viruses in the form of [[aerosol]]s, e.g. influenza virus; and by insect vectors such as mosquitoes, e.g. [[dengue]].
The rate or speed of transmission of viral infections depends on factors that include [[population density]], the number of susceptible individuals, (i.e. those who are not immune),<ref name="pmid15627236">{{cite journal

Epidemiology is used to break the chain of infection in populations during outbreaks of viral diseases.<ref>Shors p. 198</ref> Control measures are used which are based on knowledge of how the virus is transmitted. It is important to find the source, or sources, of the outbreak and to identify the virus. Once the virus has been identified, the chain of transmission can sometimes be broken by vaccines. When vaccines are not available sanitation and disinfection can be effective. Often infected people are isolated from the rest of the community and those that have been exposed to the virus placed in [[quarantine]].<ref>Shors pp. 199, 209</ref> To control the outbreak of [[Foot and Mouth Disease|foot and mouth disease]] in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands of cattle were slaughtered.<ref>Shors p. 19</ref> Most viral infections of humans and other animals have [[incubation period]]s during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms.<ref>Shors p. 126</ref> Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks but are known for most infections.<ref>Shors pp. 193<U+2013>194</ref> Following the incubation period there is a ''period of communicability''; a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal.<ref> Shors pp. 193<U+2013>94</ref> This too is known for many viral infections and knowledge the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks.<ref>Shors p. 194</ref>  When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population, community or region they are called [[epidemic]]s.

A [[pandemic]] is a worldwide epidemic. The 1918 flu pandemic, commonly referred to as the Spanish flu, was a [[Pandemic Severity Index|category 5]] influenza pandemic caused by an unusually severe and deadly influenza A virus. The victims were often healthy young adults, in contrast to most influenza outbreaks which predominantly affect juvenile, elderly, or otherwise weakened patients.<ref>Collier pp. 409<U+2013>415</ref>

Several highly lethal viral pathogens are members of the ''[[Filoviridae]]''. Filoviruses are filament-like viruses that cause [[viral hemorrhagic fever]], and include the ebola and [[marburg virus]]es. The Marburg virus attracted widespread press attention in April 2005 for an outbreak in [[Angola]].

===Host defence mechanisms===
{{see also|Polyclonal B cell response}}
The body's first line of defence against viruses is the [[innate immune system]]. This comprises cells and other mechanisms that defend the host from infection in a non-specific manner. This means that the cells of the innate system recognise, and respond to, pathogens in a generic way, but unlike the [[adaptive immune system]], it does not confer long-lasting or protective immunity to the host.<ref name=Alberts>{{cite book | last = Alberts| first = Bruce| coauthors = Alexander Johnson, Julian Lewis, Martin Raff, Keith Roberts, and Peter Walters | title = Molecular Biology of the Cell; Fourth Edition | publisher = Garland Science| date = 2002 | location = New York and London | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=mboc4.TOC&depth=2 | id = ISBN 0-8153-3218-1|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref>

}}</ref> Many viruses have a replication strategy that involves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). When such a virus infects a cell, it releases its RNA molecule or molecules, which immediately bind to a protein complex called [[dicer]] that cuts the RNA into smaller pieces. A biochemical pathway called the RISC complex is activated which degrades the viral mRNA and the cell survives the infection. Rotaviruses avoid this mechanism by not uncoating fully inside the cell and by releasing newly produced mRNA through pores in the particle's inner capsid. The genomic dsRNA remains protected inside the core of the virion.<ref name="pmid15579070">{{cite journal

When the [[adaptive immune system]] of a [[vertebrate]] encounters a virus, it produces specific [[antibodies]] which bind to the virus and render it non-infectious. This is called [[humoral immunity]]. Two types of antibodies are important. The first called IgM is highly effective at neutralizing viruses but is only produced by the cells of the immune system for a few weeks. The second, called, IgG is produced indefinitely. The presence of IgM in the blood of the host is used to test for acute infection, whereas IgG indicates an infection sometime in the past.<ref name="pmid8903801">{{cite journal

A second defence of vertebrates against viruses is called [[cell-mediated immunity]] and involves immune cells known as T cells. The body's cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell's surface, and if a T cell recognises a suspicious viral fragment there, the host cell is destroyed by ''T killer'' cells and the virus-specific T-cells proliferate. Cells such as the [[macrophage]] are specialists at this [[antigen presentation]].<ref name="pmid17725500">{{cite journal

Not all virus infections produce a protective immune response in this way. HIV evades the immune system by constantly changing the amino acid sequence of the proteins on the surface of the virion.

=== Prevention and treatment ===
Because viruses use the machinery of a host cell to reproduce and reside within them, they are difficult to eliminate without killing the host cell. The most effective medical approaches to viral diseases so far are [[vaccination]]s to provide resistance to infection, and [[antiviral drugs]].
====Vaccines====

Over the past twenty years, the development of [[antiviral drug]]s has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. Antiviral drugs are often [[nucleoside analogues]], (fake DNA building blocks), which viruses incorporate into their genomes during replication. The life-cycle of the virus is then halted because the newly synthesised DNA is inactive. This is because these analogues lack the [[hydroxyl groups]] which along with [[phosphorus]] atoms, link together to form the strong "backbone" of the DNA molecule. This is called DNA [[chain termination]].<ref name="pmid15592828">{{cite journal

Other antiviral drugs in use target different stages of the viral life cycle. HIV is dependent on a proteolytic enzyme called the [[HIV-1 protease]] for it to become fully infectious. There is a large class of drugs called [[protease inhibitors]] that inactivate this enzyme.

Hepatitis C is caused by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease is [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]], and without treatment, they are [[Infection|infected]] for the remainder of their lives. However, there is now an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug [[ribavirin]] combined with [[interferon]].<ref name="pmid17927615">{{cite journal

===Plants===
{{Main|Plant pathology}}
[[Image:Pepper mild mottle virus.png|thumb|right|[[Capsicum|Pepper]]s infected by mild mottle virus]]
There are many types of [[plant virus]], but often they only cause a loss of [[crop yield|yield]], and it is not economically viable to try to control them. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by [[organism]]s, known as [[vector (biology)|''vector]]s''. These are normally  insects, but some [[fungi]], [[Nematode|nematode worms]] and [[protozoa|single-celled organisms]] have been shown to be vectors. When control of plant virus infections is considered economical, (for perennial fruits for example), efforts are concentrated on killing the vectors and removing alternate hosts such as weeds.<ref> Shors p. 584 </ref> Plant viruses are harmless to humans and other animals because they can only reproduce in living plant cells.<ref>Shors pp. 562<U+2013>587</ref>

Plants have elaborate and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One of the most effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading.<ref>Dinesh-Kumar SP, Wai-Hong Tham, Baker BJ (2000). "Structure<U+2014>function analysis of the tobacco mosaic virus resistance gene N". ''PNAS''  97, 14789-94 PMID 11121079 </ref>  RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants.<ref>Shors pp. 573<U+2013>576</ref> When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants which kill viruses, such as [[salicylic acid]], [[nitric oxide]] and [[Reactive oxygen species|reactive oxygen molecules]].<ref>Soosaar JL, Burch-Smith TM, Dinesh-Kumar SP (2005). "Mechanisms of plant resistance to viruses". ''Nat. Rev. Microbiol.'' 3, pp. 789<U+2013>98 PMID 16132037 </ref>

===Bacteria===
{{Main|Bacteriophage}}
[[Image:Phage.jpg|thumb|right|Transmission electron micrograph of multiple [[bacteriophage]]s attached to a bacterial cell wall]]
[[Bacteriophage]]s are an extremely common and diverse group of viruses. For example, bacteriophages are the most common form of biological entity in aquatic environments, with up to ten times more of these viruses in the oceans than bacteria,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wommack KE, Colwell RR |title=Virioplankton: viruses in aquatic ecosystems |journal=Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=69<U+2013>114 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10704475 |pmc=98987 |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10704475}}</ref> reaching levels of 250,000,000 bacteriophages per [[millilitre]] of seawater.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bergh O, B<U+00F8>rsheim KY, Bratbak G, Heldal M |title=High abundance of viruses found in aquatic environments |journal=Nature |volume=340 |issue=6233 |pages=467<U+2013>8 |year=1989 |month=August |pmid=2755508 |doi=10.1038/340467a0}}</ref> These viruses infect specific bacteria by binding to [[receptor (biochemistry)|surface receptor molecules]] and then entering the cell. Within a short amount of time, in some cases just minutes, bacterial [[polymerase]] starts translating viral mRNA into protein. These proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell, helper proteins which help assembly of new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis. Viral enzymes aid in the breakdown of the cell membrane, and, in the case of the [[T4 phage]], in just over twenty minutes after injection over three hundred phages could be released.<ref>Shors pp. 595<U+2013>97</ref>

The major way bacteria defend themselves from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes which destroy foreign DNA. These enzymes, called [[restriction endonucleases]], cut up the viral DNA that bacteriophages inject into bacterial cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bickle TA, Kr<U+00FC>ger DH |title=Biology of DNA restriction |journal=Microbiol. Rev. |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=434<U+2013>50 |year=1993 |month=June |pmid=8336674 |pmc=372918 |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8336674}}</ref> Bacteria also contain a system that uses [[CRISPR]] sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of viruses that the bacteria have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block the virus's replication through a form of [[RNA interference]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barrangou R, Fremaux C, Deveau H, ''et al'' |title=CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes |journal=Science (journal) |volume=315 |issue=5819 |pages=1709<U+2013>12 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17379808 |doi=10.1126/science.1138140}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Brouns SJ, Jore MM, Lundgren M, ''et al'' |title=Small CRISPR RNAs guide antiviral defense in prokaryotes |journal=Science (journal) |volume=321 |issue=5891 |pages=960<U+2013>4 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18703739 |doi=10.1126/science.1159689}}</ref> This genetic system provides bacteria with [[immunity (medical)|acquired immunity]] to infection.

===Archaea===
Some viruses replicate within [[archaea]]: these are double-stranded DNA viruses that appear to be unrelated to any other form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes, with some resembling bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Prangishvili D, Forterre P, Garrett RA |title=Viruses of the Archaea: a unifying view |journal=Nat.

==Applications==
===Life sciences and medicine===
Viruses are important to the study of [[molecular biology|molecular]] and [[cellular biology]] as they provide simple systems that can be used to manipulate and investigate the functions of cells.<ref>Collier p.8</ref> The study and use of viruses have provided valuable information about aspects of cell biology.<ref>Lodish, Harvey; Berk, Arnold; Zipursky, S. Lawrence; Matsudaira, Paul; Baltimore, David; Darnell, James.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=Viruses&rid=mcb.section.1408#1422 Viruses:Structure, Function, and Uses] Retrieved on September 16 2008</ref>  For example, viruses have been useful in the study of [[genetics]] and helped our understanding of the basic mechanisms of [[molecular genetics]], such as [[DNA replication]], [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], [[RNA processing]], [[translation (genetics)|translation]], [[protein]] transport, and [[immunology]].

[[genetics|Geneticists]] often use viruses as [[vector (biology)|vectors]] to introduce genes into cells that they are studying. This is useful for making the cell produce a foreign substance, or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome. In similar fashion, [[virotherapy]] uses viruses as vectors to treat various diseases, as they can specifically target cells and DNA. It shows promising use in the treatment of cancer and in [[gene therapy]]. Eastern European scientists have used [[phage therapy]] as an alternative to antibiotics for some time, and interest in this approach is increasing, due to the high level of [[antibiotic resistance]] now found in some pathogenic bacteria.<ref name="pmid16258815">{{cite journal

===Materials science and nanotechnology===
Current trends in nanotechnology promise to make much more versatile use of viruses. From the viewpoint of a materials scientist, viruses can be regarded as organic nanoparticles.
Their surface carries specific tools designed to cross the barriers of their host cells. The size and shape of viruses, and the number and nature of the functional groups on their surface, is precisely defined. As such, viruses are commonly used in materials science as scaffolds for covalently linked surface modifications. A particular quality of viruses is that they can be tailored by directed evolution. The powerful techniques developed by life sciences are becoming the basis of engineering approaches towards nanomaterials, opening a wide range of applications far beyond biology and medicine.<ref name=fischlechner>{{cite journal

|doi=10.1002/anie.200603445
|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition
|volume=46
|pages=3184
|year=2007}}</ref>

Because of their size, shape, and well-defined chemical structures, viruses have been used as templates for organizing materials on the nanoscale. Recent examples include work at the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] in [[Washington, DC]], using Cowpea Mosaic Virus ([[CPMV]]) particles to amplify signals in [[DNA microarray]] based sensors. In this application, the virus particles separate the [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] [[dye]]s used for signaling in order to prevent the formation of non-fluorescent [[dimer]]s that act as [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quenchers]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Soto CM, Blum AS, Vora GJ, ''et al'' |title=Fluorescent signal amplification of carbocyanine dyes using engineered viral nanoparticles |journal=J.

===Weapons===
{{details|Biological warfare}}

[[Image:Hemorrhagic smallpox.jpg|upright|thumb|Smallpox]]
The ability of viruses to cause devastating [[epidemic]]s in human societies has led to the concern that viruses could be weaponised for [[biological warfare]]. Further concern was raised by the successful recreation of the infamous 1918 influenza virus in a laboratory.<ref>Shors p. 331</ref> The [[smallpox]] virus devastated numerous societies throughout history before its eradication. It currently exists in several secure laboratories around the world, and fears that it may be used as a weapon are not totally unfounded. The vaccine for smallpox is not safe, and during the years before the eradication of smallpox disease more people became seriously ill as a result of vaccination than did people from smallpox<ref name="pmid12911836">{{cite journal
