'''Peter Arthur Rona''' (August 17, 1934 <U+2013> February 20, 2014) was an American [[Oceanography|oceanographer]]. He was also a professor of [[Earth science|Earth]] and [[planetary science]]s at [[Rutgers University]].<ref name=Obit/>

== Early years and college ==
Born in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], Rona collected rocks and minerals as a child. This passion would lead him to a bachelor's degree in [[geology]] from [[Brown University]] in 1956 and a master's in geology from [[Yale University]] in 1957. Working for [[Standard Oil]] from 1957 to 1959, he explored the [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern U.S.]] for future [[Oil refinery|refinery]] sites. While visiting his family in December 1958, he met oceanographers, in New York for a meeting, who mentioned a new oceanic [[ecology]]. He returned to school, researching oceanographic gear at [[Columbia University]], and received a Ph.D. in marine geology and [[geophysics]] from Yale in 1967.<ref name=Obit/>

== Oceanography ==
He went on to explore the Atlantic Ocean for the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), using [[Dredging|dredges]], cameras and [[Echo sounding|echo sounders]] that mapped the seabed. While doing so, he found a [[hot spring]] along the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] in 1985. Not only did the hot spring yield valuable metals, such as gold and silver, but they also were an ecosystem of lifeforms never seen before. The 2003 film, ''[[Volcanoes of the Deep Sea]]'', documents Rona's and his colleague [[Richard A. Lutz]]'s excursions of the oceanic hot springs.<ref name=Obit/>

Rona and Lutz had been scouring the ocean floors for the organism ''[[Paleodictyon nodosum]]'', believed to be one of the Earth's earliest complex life forms, or one of the oldest "living [[fossil]]s". No living creatures have been found, only thousands of their formed hexagonal patterns.<ref name=Obit/>

In 1987, the [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]] awarded Rona its gold medal for exceptional scientific contributions to the nation. He joined Rutgers in 1994 as a professor.<ref name=Obit/>

== Death ==
In February 2014, Rona died in [[Plainsboro Township, New Jersey]], from complications related to [[multiple myeloma]]. His wife of more than 40 years, Donna, died in 2013. They are survived by one daughter, Jessica.<ref name=Obit>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/27/science/earth/peter-rona-79-explorer-of-ocean-depths-dies.html?hpw&rref=obituaries&_r=0 |title=Peter Rona, 79, Explorer of Ocean Depths, Dies |last=Broad |first=William J. |date=February 26, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 26, 2014}}</ref>
