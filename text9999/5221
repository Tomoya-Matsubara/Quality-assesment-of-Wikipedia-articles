'''''Judge John Deed''''' is a [[BBC television drama]] produced by One-Eyed Dog for [[BBC One]]. It was created by [[G. F. Newman]] (known for ''[[Law and Order (UK miniseries)|Law and Order]]'') and follows Sir John Deed (played by [[Martin Shaw]]), a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] [[judge]], who tries to seek real [[justice]] in the cases before him. It also stars [[Jenny Seagrove]] as barrister Jo Mills, frequently the object of Deed's desire. The pilot episode was broadcast on [[9 January]] [[2001]] and the first full series followed on [[26 November]] [[2001]]. The sixth and most recent series concluded on [[18 January]] [[2007]]. The series remains on a break until the style is changed and due to [[Martin Shaw]]'s involvement in a new series. After six years on air, ''Judge John Deed'' is the longest-running BBC legal drama.

The factual accuracy of the series is often criticised by newspapers and legal professionals; many of the decisions taken by Deed are unlikely to happen in a real court. The romanticised vision of the court system created by Newman has caused some judges to issue warnings to juries not to let the series influence their view of trials, specifically an episode where Deed flouts rules when called up for jury duty. Another episode led to complaints about biased and incorrect information about the [[MMR vaccine]], leading the BBC to ban repeats of it in its original form. The first two series have been released on DVD in the UK.

==Production==
[[G.F. Newman]] devised his new series to highlight what he believed to be an out-of-touch judiciary and show "solutions" (a style that differed from his previous work, such as his 1970s series ''[[Law and Order (UK miniseries)|Law and Order]]'', which was heavily critical of the [[British police|police]]).<ref>{{cite news |first= Paul|last= Nathanson|title= Why judges need more emotion|work= [[The Times]]|publisher= |date= [[2001-01-09]]|accessdate=2007-04-24 }}</ref><ref name="hattenstone">{{cite news |first= Simon|last= Hattenstone|title= Natural lawman|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/saturday_review/story/0,,416148,00.html|work= Saturday Review|work= [[The Guardian]]|publisher= |date= [[2000-12-30]]|accessdate=2007-04-24 }}</ref> Newman writes the series intending to give the audience an exploration of the law without patronising them or getting caught up in an explanation of legal proceedings.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://web.archive.org/web/20030101140735/www.bbc.co.uk/drama/crime/judge/gf_newman_interview.shtml|title= BBC Crime Drama - Judge John Deed - GF Newman Interview|accessdate=2007-04-29 |format= |work= [[bbc.co.uk]] (at the [[Internet Archive]]) }}</ref> A full series was commissioned before the pilot was broadcast.<ref name="hattenstone"/> The series has been credited with renewing the "[[police procedural|cop genre]]" by moving the story from a "maverick detective" to a high court judge.<ref name="Lawson Guardian"/>

Theme music was composed for the series by [[Debbie Wiseman]]. The music, entitled "Judge John Deed", was performed by the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] and is described as a "stunning march-like theme that echoed throughout each of the programmes supplying pageantry to the Judge's sometimes-nefarious activities".<ref>{{cite web |first= Andrew|last= Keetch|title= Something Here|url= http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/review.asp?ID=1104|work= Music from the Movies|accessdate= 2007-06-05 }}</ref> It was released commercially on Wiseman's compilation album, ''Something Here'', and as a single piece on online music retailers. Since 2005, television promotions for the series have been accompanied by the piano hook from "[[Sinnerman]]" by [[Nina Simone]].

==Setting and storylines==
{{main|List of Judge John Deed episodes}}
Judge John Deed is a recently-appointed [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] judge who actively seeks justice in the cases before him, while at the same time trying to rekindle an old romance with Jo Mills QC, who regularly appears in his court. The first few years of the series had a largely episodic structure, with a trial reaching its conclusion by the end of the episode. In later years the series has shifted to a more serialised format, with cases running over a number of episodes and past characters returning (such as the case brought by Diane Husley in series three).<ref name="screen"/> Later series have also had a greater focus on the personal lives of characters other than Deed, such as Jo's progressing romance in series five.

[[As of 2007]] there have been 29 episodes; the pilot, three series of four episodes, two series of six episodes and one series of two two-part serials. All episodes are written by G.F. Newman. At the time the sixth series concluded, the future of the series was in doubt; the BBC had announced an intention to use Martin Shaw in a range of new projects and it was apparent that the [[George Gently|one-off adaption]] of [[Alan Hunter (author)|Alan Hunter]]'s ''Inspector Gently'' novels (starring Shaw as the eponymous inspector) would be commissioned for a full series.<ref name="stagesentence">{{cite news |first= Liz|last= Thomas|title= Sentence hangs over Judge John Deed|url= http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/16073/sentence-hangs-over-judge-john-deed|work= [[The Stage]]|publisher= |date= [[2007-02-27]]|accessdate=2007-04-24 }}</ref> Jenny Seagrove later clarified the situation, stating that the producers wanted to continue but she and Shaw were "taking a sabbatical" until the formula of the series was changed, implying that its future lay in the multi-part format introduced in series six.<ref name="sabbatical">{{cite news |first= Stephen|last= Moss|title= 'My personal life was a disaster'|url= http://arts.guardian.co.uk/theatre/drama/story/0,,2058893,00.html|work= [[The Guardian]]|publisher= |date= [[2007-04-17]]|accessdate= 2007-04-28 }}</ref> The six years the series has been broadcast make it the longest-running BBC legal drama.<ref name="screen">{{cite web |first= Sergio|last= Angelini|url= http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1206805/index.html|title= Judge John Deed (2001-)|accessdate=2007-04-24|work= [[Screenonline]] }}</ref>

==Characters==
[[Image:Deed and Jo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A greater focus has been placed on the relationship between Jo Mills (left) and John Deed (right) as the series has progressed.]]
Judge Sir John Deed (played by [[Martin Shaw]]) is a former [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] and from a working-class family, who constantly struggles against an establishment that tries to pressure him into what he perceives is the wrong decision in cases. Often appearing as counsel in his court is Jo Mills (played by [[Jenny Seagrove]]), a barrister and Deed's former girlfriend.

Due to his unorthodox actions, he is often hampered in his pursuit of justice by several more conventional-minded characters, including his ex-wife, barrister Georgina "George" Channing (played by [[Caroline Langrishe]]) and her father Sir Joseph Channing (played by Sir [[Donald Sinden]]), Sir Monty Everard (played by [[Simon Ward]]), Permanent Secretary to the [[Lord Chancellor's Department]] (LCD, later [[Department of Constitutional Affairs]]) Sir Ian Rochester (played by [[Simon Chandler]]), and later the [[Home Secretary]] Neil Haughton, [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] (played by Aneurin Hughes).

While Deed's colleagues from the bench are often seen opposing him when he acts against their beliefs, occasionally they have co-operated with him. This cannot be said for Rochester, whose political views always seem to clash with Deed's ways, or Haughton, who is always worried about the political consequences of Deed's actions. Both have a rather tainted view of Deed, since he had a brief affair with Sir Ian's wife, and Haughton is the current partner of George.

Other recurring characters include Deed's rebellious, activist daughter Charlie (played by [[Louisa Clein]]), who is initially a law student but later progresses to the courts, Deed's friend, police commissioner Row Colemore (played by [[Christopher Cazenove]]) and his secretary, Rita "Coop" Cooper (played by [[Barbara Thorn]]), who is often on hand to talk him out of his more ludicrous ideas.

==Reception==
===Legal analysis===
''Judge John Deed'' presents a fictionalised version of the English and Welsh legal system. The [[British Film Institute]]'s [[Screenonline]] notes that "Almost every week, Deed is seen presiding over cases being prosecuted by his ex-wife or defended by his on-off girlfriend (with occasionally help from his daughter)", highlighting how unlikely it would be for a real judge to have so many conflicts of interest in his court. It also notes that Deed's faults, such as his affairs with his therapist and with Fracesca Rochester, prevent him from being "a completely idealised heroic figure", and the fact that because all of his family and friends practice law, he is firmly entrenched in the legal system that he is constantly fighting against.<ref name="screen"/> Deed using his connections to bail Charlie after she destroyed GM crops in "[[List of Judge John Deed episodes#ep1|Exacting Justice]]" has also been cited as hypocrisy in his character.<ref>{{cite news |first= Roland|last= White|title= An honest portrayal? Judge for yourself <U+2013> Television|work= [[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]|date= ([[2001-01-14]])|accessdate=2007-04-28 }}</ref> There is a belief in some legal circles that, although ''Deed'' is arguably the most unrealistic of contemporary legal dramas, viewers see Deed as an aspirational character taking on a corrupt establishment.<ref>{{cite news|first= Jon|last= Robins|title= Primetime drama <U+2014> the verdict on TV lawyers|url= http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/student/article1181414.ece|work= [[The Times]]|date= [[2007-01-23]]|accessdate=2007-04-28 }}</ref> Despite being picked apart by legal professionals, the cast and G.F.

The series' creative interpretation of the law has led to a misconception by the public of what real law is like (similar to the [[CSI effect]]); in the second [[Damilola Taylor]] trial, the residing judge warned the jury that if they copied Deed's actions in the then-recent episode "[[List of Judge John Deed episodes#ep24|One Angry Man]]" (2006), in which Deed investigated a case and interviewed witnesses while sitting on a jury, they would "simply derail the whole process".<ref name="damilola">{{cite news |last= Staff writer|title= Dami judge warns jury|url= http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/203/203565_dami_judge_warns_jury.html|work= [[Manchester Evening News]]|date= [[2006-02-07]]|accessdate=2007-04-24 }}</ref>

===Critical reaction===
The 2006 series caused controversy for the misguided information presented in "[[List of Judge John Deed episodes#ep23|Silent Killer]]" (2006), which suggested a link between [[TETRA]] radio emissions and motor neurone disease. A statement was released by the TETRA Industry Group, as well as the [[Motor Neurone Disease Association|MND Association]] (the latter emphasising that while there is some evidence to suggest a link, it is not a single contributory factor).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tetrahealth.info/tig_public_statements_and_docume.htm|title= Judge John Deed - BBC TV drama 27 January 2006|accessdate=2007-04-24 |format= |work= TIG Public Statements and Documents }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release | title = Tetra masts and MND - what is the evidence?| publisher = [[Motor Neurone Disease Association|MND Association]]| date = [[2006-01-30]]| url = http://www.mndassociation.org/news_and_events/news_room/press_releases/tetra_masts_and.html| accessdate = 2007-04-24 }}</ref> "[[List of Judge John Deed episodes#ep25|Heart of Darkness]]" (2006) was criticised for portraying a causal link between the [[MMR vaccine|MMR]] jab and [[autism]], and the BBC received complaints on the matter. The Editorial Complaints Unit ruled that the episode had contravened the BBC's "obligation of due impartiality on matters of public controversy" and that the episode would not be repeated in its original form.<ref>{{cite web |title= ECU ruling: Judge John Deed, BBC One|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/news/2006/10/20/37059.shtml|work= [[BBC]] Complaints|date= [[2006-10-20]]|accessdate=2007-04-24 }}</ref> The episode was cited in ''From Seesaw to Wagon Wheel'', an internal BBC report on impartiality in its output that was published in June 2007.<ref>{{cite news|first= Leigh|last= Holmwood|title= BBC shows that broke the impartiality rules|url= http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,,2105823,00.html|work= [[Media Guardian]]|date= [[2007-06-18]]|accessdate= 2007-06-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= From Seesaw to Wagon Wheel|date= [[2007-06-18]]|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/18_06_07impartialitybbc.pdf|format= PDF|work= [[BBC Trust]]|accessdate= 2007-06-30}}</ref> The report also highlighted that the name of the Westwake character bore more than a passing resemblance to that of Dr. [[Andrew Wakefield]].

Television pundits have criticised the writing of the programme; Robert Hanks of ''[[The Independent]]'' calls the scripts "often corny, even painfully so", using Monty Everard's line "You'll come to regret crossing swords with me, sir!" from "[[List of Judge John Deed episodes#ep10|Health Hazard]]" (2003) as an example.<ref name="Hanks Independent">{{cite news|first= Robert|last= Hanks|title= This Shaw is a guilty pleasure|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20031128/ai_n12733414|work=[[The Independent]] (at Find Articles)|date= [[2003-11-28]]|accessdate= 2007-09-17}}</ref> Hanks also wrote about what he called "moral oversimplification" of the storylines; the same episode featured "a wealthy and self-important businessman - who had already been banned from talking on a mobile phone while driving - ran over and killed a mother and her two small children while talking on his mobile phone to his mistress, to whom he was explaining that he had to take his wife to a function at - the icing on this shabby cake - [[10 Downing Street|Downing Street]]. He then legged it and subsequently faked mental illness to avoid a trial; a gambit that might have worked had Deed not cunningly threatened to send him to [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor]], at which point the man stood up and started protesting vociferously".<ref name="Hanks Independent"/>

The series has frequently been lampooned for its dialogue and unlikely scenes. [[Andy Hamilton]] calls the dialogue "the funniest on TV",<ref>{{cite news|last=Staff writer|title= Andy Hamilton, comedian|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20070310/ai_n18711492|work=[[The Independent]] (at Find Articles)|date= [[2007-03-10]]|accessdate= 2007-09-17}}</ref> while [[David Mitchell (actor)|David Mitchell]] selected it as his "TV hell" in the series ''[[TV Heaven, Telly Hell]]''.<ref>{{cite episode |title= Episode 6|series= TV Heaven, Telly Hell|serieslink= TV Heaven, Telly Hell|credits= [[David Mitchell (actor)|David Mitchell]] (interviewee), [[Sean Lock]] (producer)|network= [[Channel 4]]|airdate= 2006-04-30|season= 1|number= 6 }}</ref> Deed's "[[swashbuckling]]" persona has been satirised on the sketch series ''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]''.<ref>{{cite episode |title= Episode 33|series= Dead Ringers|serieslink= Dead Ringers (comedy)|credits= [[Jon Culshaw]] (performer)|network= [[BBC Two]]|airdate= 2005-05-26|season= 5|number= 3 }}</ref> Despite the often tongue-in-cheek criticism given to the programme, the series is praised as being at its best when tackling topical issues, such as the MMR vaccine, human exposure to telephone masts and [[incest|incestual]] relationships.<ref name="screen"/>

The production style also rates highly; writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Mark Lawson]] called the pilot "Glossier and more populist than Newman's earlier work". Wry reference is made to Deed and Jo's relationship, with Lawson writing that Deed "is desperate to conduct his own forensic investigation of the body fluids of the attractive defence QC".<ref name="Lawson Guardian">{{cite news|first= Mark|last= Lawson|authorlink= Mark Lawson|title= A likely story|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4113753,00.html|work=[[The Guardian]]|date= [[2001-01-08]]|accessdate= 2007-09-20}}</ref> Writing on the programme's accessibility to an audience, [[Nancy Banks-Smith]] of ''The Guardian'' calls it "talkative in the way television plays used to be when they had something to say. But it is notable that, in a profession famous for obfuscation, Deed uses only the most pellucid English".<ref>{{cite news|first= Nancy|last= Banks-Smith|authorlink= Nancy Banks-Smith|title= It's bad to talk|url= http://arts.guardian.co.uk/critic/feature/0,1169,1159744,00.html|work= [[The Guardian]]|date= [[2003-11-28]]|accessdate= 2007-09-21}}</ref> As a comparison to Newman's previous work, Simon Hattenstone wrote that is "rather soft" and unlikely to provoke questions in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], like ''Law and Order'' did.<ref name="hattenstone"/>

===Awards===
Stephen Roach received the Award of Merit at the 2005 Guild of Television Cameramen Awards for his work on the series.<ref>{{cite news|last= Staff writer|title= Cameramen awards|url= http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/broadcastnowArticle.aspx?intStoryID=153136|work= [[Broadcast magazine|Broadcast Now]] (subscription)|date= ([[2005-10-06]])|accessdate= 2007-06-25 }}</ref> The series was nominated in the Diversity in Drama Production category at the 2006 [[Screen Nation]] Awards, though lost to an episode of ''[[Doctors (BBC soap opera)|Doctors]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Screen Nation Awards 2006|url=http://www.celebritiesworldwide.com/Award.cfm?Year=2006&ContentID=1000|work=Celebrities Worldwide|accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref>

==Series information==
===Broadcast history===
''Judge John Deed'' regularly forms the backbone of the [[BBC One]] winter schedule. The pilot and first series were broadcast on Tuesday evenings at 8 p.m., with the second, third and fourth series moving to Thursday evenings (8:30 p.m. for the first two and 8 p.m. for the latter, though one episode in series three was postponed for over a month). The fifth series moved to Friday nights, and the sixth was shown two nights a week, with the first part of the story on Tuesday nights and concluding the following Thursday. This series was also the first to be simulcast on [[BBC HD]].<ref>{{cite news |title= BBC announces January first showings in HD|url= http://www.hdtvuk.tv/2006/12/bbc_announces_j.html|work= HDTV UK|date= [[2006-12-15]]|accessdate=2007-04-24 }}</ref> Occasionally, due to a clash with regional programming, ''Deed'' has aired at different times on [[BBC One Scotland]]; series two was delayed for sometimes over a week while series three began a half hour earlier. Series five would have a six-day delay.<ref>[http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/series/JUDGE+JOHN+DEED BBC Programme Catalogue <U+2013> Judge John Deed]</ref>

Ratings for the series peaked with its [[List of Judge John Deed episodes#ep1|first episode]] at 9.1 million<ref>{{cite news |first= Matt|last= Wells|title= ITV admits 'commercial' BBC cannot be beaten|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,607956,00.html|work= [[The Guardian]]|date= [[2001-11-28]]|accessdate=2007-09-16 }}</ref> but it still regularly draws in around 6 million viewers for new episodes. The series has been shown internationally by, amongst others, [[Canvas (Belgium)]], [[BBC America]] and [[BBC Canada]]. At one time ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported an American remake was set to be produced for [[NBC]], coincidentally by a producer known for a different ''[[Law & Order]]''; Michael Chernuchin was to produce the series, which would follow a federal court judge in [[Washington, D.C.]] who would preside over terrorism and civil rights cases.<ref name="varietyremake">{{cite news |first= Josef|last= Adalian|title= 'Law' man cases nets (Chernuchin adapting BBC's 'Deed' for NBC)|url= http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117911343.html|work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date= [[2004-10-24]]|accessdate=2007-04-24 }}</ref> There have been no further developments since the announcement was made in 2004.
