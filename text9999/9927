'''Cyril Lionel Robert James''' ([[4 January]] [[1901]]&ndash;[[19 May]] [[1989]]) was a [[journalist]], [[socialist]] theorist and [[writer]].

== Birth and early career ==
Born in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], then a [[British Empire|British Crown colony]], James attended the [[Queen's Royal College]] in [[Port of Spain]] before becoming a [[cricket]] [[journalist]] and also writing fiction.  He would also work as a school teacher, teaching among others the young [[Eric Williams]]. Together with [[Albert Gomes]] and [[Alfred Mendes]], James was a member of the anti-colonialist ''Beacon'' Group, a circle of writers associated with ''The Beacon'' magazine.  In [[1932]], he moved to [[Nelson, England|Nelson]] in [[Lancashire]], [[England]] in the hope of furthering his literary career.  There, he worked for the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' and helped the cricketer [[Learie Constantine]] write his [[autobiography]].

==London years==

In [[1933]], James moved to [[London]].  James had begun to campaign for the independence of the [[West Indies]] while in Trinidad, and his ''Life of Captain Cipriani'' and the pamphlet ''The Case for West-Indian Self Government'' were his first important published works,  but now he became a leading champion of [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-African]] agitation and the Chair of the International African Friends of Abyssinia, formed in 1935 in response to Fascist Italy's invasion of what is now Ethiopia.  He then became a leading figure in the [[International African Service Bureau]], led by his childhood friend [[George Padmore]] through which he later met [[Kwame Nkrumah]].  In Britain, he also became a leading Marxist theorist.  He had joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], but in the midst of the Great Depression became convinced of Trotskyism and in 1934 joined an [[entrist]] Trotskyist group inside the [[Independent Labour Party]].

In this period, amid his frantic political activity, James wrote a play about [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]], which was staged in the [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1936 and starred [[Paul Robeson]].  He also wrote what are perhaps his best-known works of non-fiction: ''[[World Revolution (book)|World Revolution]]'' ([[1937]]), a history of the rise and fall of the [[Communist International]] which was critically praised by [[Leon Trotsky]], and ''[[The Black Jacobins]]: Toussaint L'Ouverture and the San Domingo Revolution'' ([[1938]]), a widely acclaimed history of the [[Haitian revolution]] which would later be seen as a seminal text in the study of the [[African diaspora]].

In [[1936]], James and his Trotskyist [[Marxist Group]] left the Independent Labour Party to form an [[open party]].  In [[1938]], this new group took part in several mergers to form the [[Revolutionary Socialist League (UK)|Revolutionary Socialist League]].  The RSL was a highly factionalised organisation and when James was invited to tour the United States by the leadership of the [[Socialist Workers' Party (US)|Socialist Workers' Party]], then the US section of the [[Fourth International]], in order to facilitate its work among black workers, he was encouraged to leave by one such factional opponent, John Archer, in the hope of removing a rival.

== US career and the Johnson-Forest Tendency == 
James moved to the US in late 1938 and after a tour sponsored by the SWP stayed on for over twenty years. But by [[1940]] he had developed severe doubts about Trotsky's analysis of the [[Soviet Union]] as a [[degenerated workers state]] and left the SWP along with [[Max Shachtman]], who formed the [[Workers' Party (US)|Workers' Party]]. Within the WP he formed the [[Johnson-Forest Tendency]] with [[Raya Dunayevskaya]] (his pseudonym being ''Johnson'' and Dunayevskaya's ''Forest'') and [[Grace Lee]] (later [[Grace Lee Boggs]]) in order to spread their views within the new party. 

While within the WP the views of the J-F tendency underwent considerable development and by the end of the [[Second World War]] they had definitively rejected Trotsky's theory of Russia as a degenerated workers state, instead analysing it as being [[state capitalist]]. They were increasingly looking towards the autonomous movements of oppressed minorities, a theoretical development already visible in James' thought in his discussions with Leon Trotsky which took place in [[1939]]. An interest in such autonomous struggles came to take centre stage for the tendency.

After [[1945]] the WP saw the prospects for a revolutionary upsurge as receding. The J-F Tendency, by contrast, were more enthused by prospects for mass struggles and came to the conclusion that the SWP, which they considered more proletarian than the WP, thought similarly to themselves about such prospects. Therefore, after a short few months as an independent group when they published a great deal of material for a small group, the J-F tendency joined the SWP in [[1947]].

James would still describe himself as a [[Leninist]], despite his rejection of Lenin's conception of the vanguard role of the revolutionary party, and argue for socialists to support the emerging [[black nationalist]] movements. By [[1949]], he came to reject the idea of a [[vanguard party]].  This led his tendency to leave the Trotskyist movement and rename itself the [[Correspondence Publishing Committee]]. In 1955, nearly half the membership of Committee would leave under the leadership of Raya Dunayevskaya to form a separate tendency of [[Marxist-humanism]] and found the organization, ''[[News and Letters Committees]]''. Whether Raya Dunayevskaya's faction constituted a majority or minority seems to be a matter of dispute. Historian Kent Worcester claims that Dunayevskaya's supporters formed a majority of the pre-split Correspondence Publishing Committee but [[Martin Glaberman]] has claimed in ''[[New Politics (magazine)|New Politics]]'' that the faction loyal to James had a majority.  The Committee split again in 1962 as [[Grace Lee Boggs]] and [[James Boggs (activist)|James Boggs]], two key activists, left to pursue a more [[Third Worldist]] approach. The remaining Johnsonites, including leading member Martin Glaberman reconstituted themselves as [[Facing Reality]], which James advised from Britain until the group dissolved, against James' advice, in 1970.  James' writings were influential in the development of [[Autonomist marxism]] as a current within marxist thought, though he himself saw his life's work as developing the theory and practice of Leninism.

== Return to Trinidad and final years ==
In [[1953]], James was forced to leave the US under threat of deportation for having overstayed his [[Visa (document)|visa]] by over ten years. Famously in his attempt to remain in the USA he wrote a study of [[Herman Melville]], ''Mariners, Renegades and Castaways: The Story of Herman Melville and the World We Live In'', and had copies of the privately published work sent to every member of the Senate. He wrote the book whilst being detained on [[Ellis Island]]. He returned back to England and then, in [[1958]] returned to Trinidad, where he edited ''The Nation'' [[newspaper]] for the pro-independence [[People's National Movement]] (PNM) party.  He also had become involved again in the [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-African]] movement, believing that the [[Ghana revolution]] showed that decolonisation was the most important inspiration for international revolutionaries.

James also advocated the [[West Indies Federation]], and it was over this that he fell out with the PNM leadership.  He returned to Britain, then to the US in [[1968]], where he taught at the [[University of the District of Columbia]].  Ultimately, he returned to Britain and spent his last years in [[Brixton]], London.

In 1983, a short British film featuring James in dialogue with the famous historian, [[E.P. Thompson]] was made.

A public library in Hackney, London is named in his honor.

==Writings on Cricket==
CLR James is most widely known as a writer on cricket, especially for his autobiographical [[1963]] book, ''[[Beyond a Boundary]]''. This is considered a seminal work of cricket writing, and is often named as the best single book on cricket (or even the best book on any sport) ever written. [http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155347.html]

The book's key question, which is frequently quoted by modern journalists and essayists, is: ''What do they know of cricket who only cricket know?'' James uses this challenge as the basis for describing cricket in an historical and social context, the strong influence cricket had on his life, and how it meshed with his role in politics and his understanding of issues of class and race. The literary quality of the writing attracts cricketers of all political views.
