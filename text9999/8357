"'''One Tree Hill'''" is a song by [[rock music|rock]] band [[U2]] and is the ninth track on their 1987 album ''[[The Joshua Tree]]''. In March 1988, it was released as the fourth single from the album in New Zealand and Australia, while "[[In God's Country]]" was released as the fourth single in North America. The release charted at number one on the [[Recording Industry Association of New Zealand|New Zealand singles chart]]. 

The track was written in memory of Greg Carroll, a [[M<U+0101>ori people|M<U+0101>ori]] the band met during [[The Unforgettable Fire Tour]] in 1984. He became very close friends with lead singer [[Bono]] and served as a [[road crew|roadie]] for the group. Carroll was killed in July 1986 in a motorcycle accident in Dublin. Following the funeral in New Zealand, Bono wrote the lyrics to "One Tree Hill", which he dedicated to Carroll. The lyrics reflect Bono's thoughts at the funeral and pay homage to Chilean activist [[Victor Jara]]. Musically, the song was developed in a [[jam session]] with producer [[Brian Eno]]. The vocals were recorded in a single take, as Bono felt incapable of singing them a second time.

"One Tree Hill" was received favourably by critics, who variously described it as "a soft, haunting benediction",<ref name="Pond" /> "a remarkable musical centrepiece",<ref name="Hogg" /> and a celebration of life.<ref name="Graham" /> U2 delayed performing the song on the [[Joshua Tree Tour]] in 1987 due to Bono's fears over his emotional state. After its live debut on the tour's third leg and an enthusiastic reaction from audiences, the song was played occasionally for the rest of the tour and semi-regularly during the [[Lovetown Tour]] of 1989<U+2013>1990. It has appeared only sporadically since then, and most renditions were performed in New Zealand. Performances in November 2010 on the [[U2 360<U+00B0> Tour]] were dedicated to the miners who died in the [[Pike River Mine disaster]].

On 3 July 1986,<ref name="Parra86">de la Parra (2003), p. 78</ref> just before the start of the recording sessions for ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'', Carroll was killed in a motorcycle accident while on a courier run. A car had pulled in front of him, and unable to stop in the rain, Carroll struck the side of the car and was killed instantly.<ref name="Stokes" /> The event shocked the entire band; drummer [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]] said, "his death really rocked us <U+2013> it was the first time anyone in our working circle had been killed."<ref name="U2177" /> Guitarist [[The Edge]] said, "Greg was like a member of the family, but the fact that he had come under our wing and had travelled so far from home to be in Dublin to work with us made it all the more difficult to deal with."<ref name="U2178">McCormick (2006), p. 178</ref> Bassist [[Adam Clayton]] described it as "a very sobering moment", saying, "it inspired the awareness that there are more important things than rock 'n' roll.

He was doing me a favour. He was taking my bike home."<ref name="Stokes" /> He later commented, "it brought gravitas to the recording of ''The Joshua Tree''. We had to fill the hole in our heart with something very, very large indeed, we loved him so much."<ref name="U2178" /> Accompanied by Bono, Ali, Mullen, and other members of the U2 organisation, Carroll's body was flown back to New Zealand and buried in the traditional M<U+0101>ori manner at Kai-iwi Marae.<ref name="Stokes" /><ref name="Parra86" /> Bono sang "[[Let It Be (song)|Let It Be]]" and "[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]" for him at the funeral.<ref name="Parra86" />

Shortly after returning to Dublin, Bono wrote lyrics for a song about the funeral that he titled "One Tree Hill" after the hill he remembered from his visit to Auckland in 1984.<ref name="Parra86" /> The music was developed early in the recording sessions for ''The Joshua Tree''. The Edge said, "We were jamming with [[Brian Eno|Brian [Eno]]]. He was playing keyboards ... we just got this groove going, and this part began to come through. It's almost [[highlife]], although it's not African at all ... the sound was for me at that time a very elaborate one.

In the song, Bono included the lyric: "Jara sang, his song a weapon in the hands of love / You know his blood still cries from the ground". This refers to the Chilean political activist and folk singer [[Victor Jara]], who become a symbol of the resistance against the [[Augusto Pinochet]] government after he was tortured and killed during the [[1973 Chilean coup d'<U+00E9>tat]].<ref name="album notes2007">{{cite album-notes |title=The Joshua Tree 20th anniversary edition |bandname=U2 |year=2007 |publisher=[[Island Records]] |format=Boxset |location=Canada |publisherid=B0010304-00}}</ref> Bono learned of Jara after meeting Ren<U+00E9> Castro, a Chilean mural artist, while on [[Amnesty International]]'s [[A Conspiracy of Hope]] tour.

"One Tree Hill" runs for 5:23 (5 minutes, 23 seconds). It is played in [[Time signature|common time]] at a [[tempo]] of 120 beats per minute.<ref name="Sheets">Chipkin (1999), pp. 69<U+2013>77</ref> The song begins with a highlife-influenced riff by The Edge on guitar, which repeats in the background throughout the song.<ref name="album notes2007" /><ref name="Sheets" /> Percussion from drummer [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]] enters after two seconds.

The second verse then begins at 1:49, and after the second chorus, a brief musical interlude begins at 2:36, in which The Edge's guitar is replaced by the Raad strings.<ref name="album notes2007" /> The third verse begins at 3:07, and The Edge's guitar resumes at 3:38 in the chorus. A guitar solo begins at 4:16 and is played until the instrumentation comes to a close at 4:36. After two seconds of silence, the Raad strings fade in and Bono proceeds to sing the coda. The final lyric and strings fade out over the final six seconds.<ref name="album notes2007"/>

Clayton called it part of a trilogy of songs on the album, along with "[[Bullet the Blue Sky]]" and "[[Mothers of the Disappeared]]", that decry the involvement of the United States in the Chilean coup.<ref name="album notes2007" /> McGuinness stated that the imagery in the song described the sense of tragedy felt by the band over Carroll's death.<ref name="Phantom" /> Colm O'Hare of ''[[Hot Press]]'' believed The Edge's guitar riff personified the lyric "run like a river runs to the sea".<ref name="Hare" /> Thom Duffy of the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' felt the song reflected the seducation of a lover.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1987-03-22/entertainment/0120000208_1_u2-joshua-hewson |title=U2 |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |first=Thom |last=Duffy |date=22 March 1987 |accessdate=26 September 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61zk0cjrU |archivedate=26 September 2011}}</ref> Richard Harrington of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' acknowledged the tribute to Carroll, adding that it demonstrated U2's belief that music could spur change.<ref>{{cite news |title=U2 Can Be Famous; Breaking Into the Big Time With 'Joshua Tree' |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |first=Richard |last=Harrington |date=22 March 1987 |page=G1}}</ref>

Like many other U2 songs, "One Tree Hill" can be interpreted in a religious manner. ''Hot Press'' editor [[Niall Stokes]] called it "a spiritual tour de force", saying "it is a hymn of praise and celebration which described the traditional M<U+0101>ori burial of their friend on One Tree Hill and links it poetically with themes of renewal and redemption."<ref name="Stokes" /> Beth Maynard, a Church [[Rector#Ecclesiastical rectors|rector]] from Fairhaven, Massachusetts, felt the song "vows faith in the face of loss, combining elegiac lines about a friend ... and the martyred Chilean activist and folk singer Victor Jara, with a subtle evocation of end-time redemption and a wrenching wail to God to send the pentecostal Latter Rain."<ref>Whiteley (2003), p. 170</ref> Matt Soper, Senior Minister of the West Houston Church of Christ, believed the lyrics were an attempt by Bono to understand God's place in the world.<ref>Soper (2010), p. 72</ref> Steve Stockman, a chaplain at [[Queen's University of Belfast]], felt that the song alluded to "transcendent places beyond the space and time of earth".<ref>Stockman (2005), p. 68</ref> Music journalist Bill Graham noted "the lyrics, with their reference to traditional M<U+0101>ori burial ceremonies on One Tree Hill, indicated that the band's faith didn't exclude an empathy with others' beliefs and rituals. Their Christianity wouldn't plaster over the universal archetypes of mourning."<ref name="Graham" />

"One Tree Hill" was received favourably by critics. ''Hot Press'' editor Niall Stokes described it as one of U2's best tracks, calling it a "fitting tribute" to Carroll.<ref name="Stokes" /> The ''[[Toronto Star]]'' felt it was one of the best songs on the album.<ref name="Star" /> Steve Morse of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' compared Bono's vocals at the song's conclusion to the passion of American [[soul music|soul singer]] [[Otis Redding]], also noting that the coda was reminiscent of the hymn "[[Amazing Grace]]".<ref name="Morse">{{cite news |title=U2's ''The Joshua Tree'': A Spiritual Progress Report |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |last=Morse |first=Steve |date=1 March 1987 |page=B32 |quote=[Bono's] emotional outpouring at the end ... has a passion on a par with peak-period Otis Redding.

Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', John Rockwell felt that it was an example of U2 stretching their range, saying "the inclusion of musical idioms [is] never so overtly explored before on a U2 record, especially the gospel chorus of 'One Tree Hill'".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/29/arts/u2-makes-a-bid-for-great-band-status.html?pagewanted=3&src=pm |title=U2 makes a bid for 'great band' status |first=John |last=Rockwell |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=29 March 1987 |accessdate=25 September 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61yJl1pKX |archivedate=25 September 2011}}</ref> Colin Hogg of ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' called it "a remarkable musical centrepiece", believing it to be the best song on the album.<ref name="Hogg">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=10411209 |title=Album review: The Joshua Tree |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=20 March 1987 |first=Colin |last=Hogg |accessdate=1 February 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wAAtIr2z |archivedate=1 February 2011 |quote=... not only is it a song that means a lot in this part of the world, but it is the album's finest, saddest melody and its most heartfelt performance, building in urgency until Bono's voice just explodes to the song's climax.}}</ref> Colm O'Hare of ''Hot Press'' said it was "arguably the most poignant, emotionally-charged song U2 have ever recorded."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hotpress.com/archive/4269254.html?new_layout=1&page_no=14&show_comments=1 |title=The Secret History of 'The Joshua Tree' 14/18 |first=Colm |last=O'Hare |work=Hot Press |date=21 November 2007 |accessdate=26 September 2011 |archivedate=26 September 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61zi6VlJb}}</ref> He added that it was the "least instrumentally adorned song on the album, resplendent in a feeling of space and openness."<ref name="Hare" /> McGuinness called it one of his favourite U2 songs.<ref name="Propaganda" />
