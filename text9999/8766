'''Drew Doughty''' (born December 8, 1989) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[defenceman (ice hockey)|defenceman]] currently playing for the [[Los Angeles Kings]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). He was selected second overall by the Kings in the [[2008 NHL Entry Draft]], following a standout junior career with the [[Guelph Storm]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL), where he was twice voted the league's top offensive defenceman. He made his NHL debut in 2008 as an 18-year-old and was named to the All-Rookie Team. He has represented Canada four times internationally, winning a gold medal at the [[2008 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]], where he was named the tournament's top defenceman, and a silver at the [[2009 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships]]. The youngest player on the team, he won a gold medal at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]]  and was named a finalist for the [[James Norris Memorial Trophy|Norris Trophy]] as the top defenceman in the NHL in 2010.
