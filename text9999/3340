'''Sam Neill''' (born '''Nigel John Dermot Neill'''), [[New Zealand Order of Merit|DCNZM]], [[Order of British Empire|OBE]] (born [[14 September]], [[1947]]) is a [[New Zealand]] film and television [[actor]], and owner of the [[Two Paddocks]] [[winery]] in [[Central Otago]]. He is most widely known for playing paleontologist [[List_of_characters_in_Jurassic_Park#Dr._Alan_Grant|Doctor Alan Grant]] in ''[[Jurassic Park]]'' and ''[[Jurassic Park III]]''.
 
Born in [[Omagh]], [[Northern Ireland]], he was the second son of Dermot, a [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]]-educated army officer and third generation [[New Zealand|New Zealander]] (who was then stationed in Northern Ireland), and his [[England|English]] wife, Priscilla. The family were the owners of Neill and Co., the largest liquor retailers in New Zealand.

Neill returned with his family to [[New Zealand]] in 1954, where he attended the [[Anglican]] boys' boarding school [[Christ's College]], in [[Christchurch]]. He then went on to study English literature at the [[University of Canterbury]], where he got his first exposure to acting. While at Canterbury University he resided at [[College House]]<ref>http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=341&ObjectID=10353801</ref>, where he held the position of Chief Castigator and Crime Crusher (CCACC). He then moved to [[Wellington]] to continue his tertiary education at the [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University]], from which he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[English Literature]]. He has one son, Tim (born in 1983), by New Zealand actress [[Lisa Harrow]], and one daughter, Elena (born in 1990), by makeup artist Noriko Watanabe, whom he married in 1989.

==Acting career==
After working at the New Zealand National Film Unit as a director and actor, Neill was cast as the lead in the [[New Zealand]] film ''[[Sleeping Dogs (movie)|Sleeping Dogs]]''. Following this he appeared in the [[Australia]]n classic, ''[[My Brilliant Career]]'' (1979), opposite [[Judy Davis]].  
This appearance led to his being selected to play Damien in ''[[Omen III: The Final Conflict]]'' in 1981, one of the sequels to ''[[The Omen]]''. In the late-1970s his [[mentoring|mentor]] was the notable British actor [[James Mason]].

After [[Roger Moore]] made his last [[James Bond]] movie in 1985, Neill was seriously considered for the role in ''[[The Living Daylights]]''. He impressed people with his screen test and was the preferred choice of director [[John Glen]]. However, [[Albert R. Broccoli|Cubby Broccoli]] was not as impressed by Neill, and the role eventually went to [[Timothy Dalton]] instead. Since then, Neill has played heroes and villains in a succession of film and television dramas and comedies. In the UK, he became well-known in the early-1980s, starring in dramas such as ''Ivanhoe'' and notably in the title role of ''[[Reilly, Ace of Spies]]''.

Neill is best known for his leading and co-starring roles in major (mainly U.S.-funded) films including  ''[[Dead Calm (film)|Dead Calm]]'' (1989), ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' (1990), ''[[The Piano]]'' (1993), ''[[Sirens (film)|Sirens]]'' (1994), ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993), ''[[Event Horizon]]'' (1997), ''[[The Dish]]'' (2000) and ''[[Jurassic Park III]]'' (2001).  

The film ''Cinema of Unease: A Personal Journey by Sam Neill'' (1995) was written and directed by Sam Neill and [[Judy Rymer]].  In it Neill narrated his personal recollection of New Zealand film history.
Neill was asked to play the role of [[Elrond]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[Peter Jackson]], but turned it down because of his contractual obligations to another film, namely, ''Jurassic Park III'' (2001).
He hosted and narrated a series of 2002 documentaries for BBC entitled ''[[Space (documentary)|Space]]'' (''Hyperspace'' in the United States).
Neill is expected to reprise his role as Paleontologist [[list of characters in Jurassic Park|Alan Grant]] in the possible [[2008]] film [[Jurassic Park IV]].

==Controversy==
Sam Neill is currently appearing in an Australian television commercial as part of a marketing campaign by ''Meat and Livestock Australia'', a company representing the interests of livestock producers, processors, exporters, food service operators and food retailers. He's shown in a classroom of children while conveying, "Red meat - we were meant to eat it". This raised controversy with those opposed to the eating of meat.<ref>http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/red-meat-red-herring/2006/03/23/1143083898475.html The Age -- News, "Red meat, red herring"</ref>


In [[2006]], Neill also lent his voice to a series of radio ads for [[Fifth Third Bank]] in the midwestern U.S.
