'''Delaware Route 1''' ('''DE&nbsp;1''') is a {{convert|103.02|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[state highway]] in the U.S. state of [[Delaware]]. The route runs from the [[Maryland]] border in [[Fenwick Island, Delaware|Fenwick Island]], [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]], where it continues into that state as [[Maryland Route 528]] (MD&nbsp;528), north to an interchange with [[Delaware Route 58|DE&nbsp;58]] in [[Christiana, Delaware|Christiana]], [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]], where the road continues north as [[Delaware Route 7|DE&nbsp;7]]. Between Fenwick Island and [[Dover Air Force Base]] in [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]], [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent County]], DE&nbsp;1 is a four- to six-lane surface [[divided highway]] with occasional interchanges. The route heads north past the [[Delaware Beaches]] along the [[Atlantic Ocean]] before it runs northwest through rural areas, turning north at [[Milford, Delaware|Milford]] to continue to Dover. Upon reaching Dover, DE&nbsp;1 becomes the '''Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway''', a four- to six-lane [[freeway]] that is [[toll road|tolled]]. Between Dover and [[Tybouts Corner, Delaware|Tybouts Corner]], DE&nbsp;1 parallels [[U.S. Route 13 in Delaware|U.S. Route 13]] (US&nbsp;13), crossing over and featuring interchanges with it multiple times. Past Tybouts Corner, the freeway heads north to Christiana, reaching an interchange with [[Interstate 95 in Delaware|Interstate 95]] (I-95) a short distance before its terminus.

DE&nbsp;1 was first designated in the 1970s between Fenwick Island and [[U.S. Route 113|US&nbsp;113]] in Milford, replacing a portion of [[Delaware Route 14|DE&nbsp;14]] and following the newly constructed Milford Bypass. DE&nbsp;14 between Fenwick Island and Milford had been built as a state highway in the 1920s and 1930s and was widened into a divided highway between the 1950s and 1970s. In the 1980s, a limited-access Relief Route for US&nbsp;13 was proposed between Dover and the [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]] area in order to relieve that route of beach traffic. This relief route would be incorporated into DE&nbsp;1 in 1988, with the route extended up US&nbsp;113 between Milford and Dover to connect to the Relief Route. The tolled DE&nbsp;1 freeway between Dover Air Force Base and Christiana opened in multiple stages between 1991 and 2003, and at a cost of $900 million was the largest public works project in Delaware history. The concurrent US&nbsp;113 designation north of Milford was removed in 2004. Upgrades continue to be made to DE&nbsp;1 such as the construction and improvement of interchanges as well as widening portions of the road.

==Route description==

===Fenwick Island to Lewes===
DE&nbsp;1 begins at the [[Maryland]] border in the [[Delaware Beaches]] community of [[Fenwick Island, Delaware|Fenwick Island]] in [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]], where the road continues south into [[Ocean City, Maryland]] as [[Maryland Route 528|MD&nbsp;528]]. From this point, DE&nbsp;1 heads north on four-lane [[divided highway|divided]] Coastal Highway. A block after the state line, the route intersects the eastern terminus of [[Delaware Route 54|DE&nbsp;54]]. The road continues north through business areas with some residences a short distance to the west of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. DE&nbsp;1 leaves Fenwick Island and heads into [[Fenwick Island State Park]], running along a narrow strip of land with the [[Little Assawoman Bay]] to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. The route passes a small area of residential development before it goes through more of the state park. The road enters [[South Bethany, Delaware|South Bethany]], where it passes through residential areas. DE&nbsp;1 heads into commercial areas in [[Middlesex Beach, Delaware|Middlesex Beach]] and briefly curves northwest before turning north again and continuing into [[Bethany Beach, Delaware|Bethany Beach]], where the road name changes to Delaware Avenue. The route runs past residences and comes to an intersection with [[Delaware Route 26|DE&nbsp;26]], which heads east into the commercial center of Bethany Beach. The road curves northeast and leaves Bethany Beach as it passes to the east of a [[Delaware National Guard]] training site. Continuing north, DE&nbsp;1 becomes Coastal Highway again and runs between wooded areas to the west and beachfront homes to the east. Farther north, the route crosses into [[Delaware Seashore State Park]], where it travels along a strip of land between the [[Indian River Bay]] to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. DE 1 comes to a [[right-in/right-out]] access point to the park before it crosses over the [[Indian River Inlet]] on the cable-stayed [[Indian River Inlet Bridge]].<ref name="DE 2008 map">{{Delaware road map|year=2008}}</ref><ref name="google">{{google maps |url=http://goo.gl/maps/qKiSE|title=overview of Delaware Route 1|accessdate=November 4, 2014}}</ref>

==History==

===South of Dover===
[[File:DE 1 SB at Clapham Road.JPG|thumb|right|DE 1 southbound at Clapham Road in Little Heaven]]
The portion of DE 1 between Milford and Little Heaven was initially built as part of the DuPont Highway, a highway that spanned the state from [[Selbyville, Delaware|Selbyville]] to [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]]. The highway was proposed as a modern road that was part of a philanthropic measure. This roadway was planned to improve travel and bring economic development to Kent and Sussex counties. The DuPont Highway was to be modeled after the great boulevards of [[Europe]] and was to have a {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}} wide right-of-way consisting of a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} wide roadway for automobiles flanked by dual [[Tram|trolley]] lines, {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide roadways for heavy vehicles, {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} wide unpaved roadways for horses, and sidewalks. Utilities were to be buried underground below the horse roadways. The highway was also to include agricultural experimental stations and monuments for future surveying. Trolley revenues would help pay for the construction of the roadway. After portions of the DuPont Highway were built, these portions were planned to be turned over to the state at no charge.<ref name=Milner-6-8>[[#Milner|Milner]], pp. 6, 8.</ref>

In 1911, the Coleman DuPont Road, Inc. was established and construction on the highway began.<ref name=Milner-10/> By 1912, construction was interrupted by litigation challenging both the constitutionality of the law establishing the road building corporation and the need for DuPont to acquire such a large right-of-way.<ref name=Milner-13>[[#Milner|Milner]], p. 13.</ref> DuPont would narrow the proposed right-of-way to {{convert|100|ft|m}} in order to compromise with opponents of the highway in addition to offering landowers whose properties were affected by the highway five times the assessed value of the land five years after the highway was completed.<ref name=Milner-10>[[#Milner|Milner]], p. 10.</ref> The DuPont Highway would end up being built on a {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} alignment with a {{convert|32|ft|m|adj=on}} wide roadway. The DuPont Highway north of Milford would be both designed and constructed by Delaware State Highway Department (DSHD).<ref name=Milner-14>[[#Milner|Milner]], p. 14.</ref> A portion of the road north of Milford and from Frederica to Little Heaven were completed by 1920.<ref name="DE 1920 map"/>  The portion of the DuPont Highway from north of Milford to Frederica was under construction in 1920 and completed by 1923, the same year the last section of the entire Selbyville<U+2013>Wilmington highway was completed near Odessa.<ref name="Milner-16">[[#Milner|Milner]], p. 16.</ref> When the [[U.S. Highway System]] was designated in 1926, this portion of the DuPont Highway became a part of US 113.<ref name="1925 report">{{cite journal|title=Annual Report of the State Highway Department|edition=1925|page=17|publisher=Delaware State Highway Department|location=Dover, Delaware|date=December 31, 1925|url=http://www.deldot.gov/archaeology/historic_pres/annual_reports/pdf/1925/annual_1925.pdf|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name="USHM">{{cite map |publisher= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |title= United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials |url= http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth298433/m1/1/zoom/ |date= November 11, 1926 |scale= 1:7,000,000 |cartography= U.S. Geological Survey |oclc= 32889555 |accessdate=April 27, 2009}}</ref>

In April 1992, groundbreaking took place for the section of DE 1 across the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal.<ref name=SR1timeline/> It was decided that the highway would cross the canal on a cable-stayed bridge.<ref>{{cite news|title=New C&D Canal Bridge|work=On the Road|publisher=Delaware Department of Transportation|issue=5|date=Fall 1990|page=2|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050211062033/http://www.deldot.org/static/projects/sr1/pdfs/on_the_road-5.pdf|accessdate=October 18, 2014}}</ref> The section of DE 1 between DE 273 and I-95 in Christiana opened in April 1993.<ref name=SR1timeline/> The section of the tollway between US 113 at Dover Air Force Base and US 13 north of Smyrna opened on December 21, 1993, with Governor Tom Carper in attendance at the opening ceremony.

The plan drew concerns from residents in St. Georges who feared the community would be split in half. The St. Georges Bridge was instead kept and was refurbished. A southbound exit and northbound entrance at US 13 south of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Bridge along DE 1 was built as required by federal legislation that gave the state $115 million toward construction of the new canal bridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deldot.org/static/projects/sr1/3rd.html|title=State Route 1 Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Bridge to Tybouts Corner Overview|work=Internet Archives WayBack Machine|publisher=Delaware Department of Transportation|accessdate=October 17, 2014 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030624021111/http://www.deldot.org/static/projects/sr1/3rd.html|archivedate = June 24, 2003}}</ref>

Construction of an interchange at the Dover Air Force Base main gate commenced in February 1996.<ref name=SR1timeline/> This project resulted in the relocation of the main gate further back in order to build the interchange and the overpass linking the main gate to base housing.

In March 2000, groundbreaking took place for the final segment of the DE 1 freeway between Smyrna and Odessa. The interchange at the Dover Air Force Base main gate was completed in July of that year.<ref name=SR1timeline/> The construction of the final segment resulted in a portion of US 13 south of Odessa being shifted further east as DE 1 would be built on top of the road.

Traffic congestion at the cloverleaf interchange with I-95 in Christiana led to DelDOT to improve the interchange.

DelDOT has plans to widen DE 1 by an additional lane in each direction between the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Bridge and the DE 273 interchange in Christiana. The project will involve widening bridges and reconfiguring interchanges.
