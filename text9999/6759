The '''Grey-necked Rockfowl''' (''Picathartes oreas'') is a medium-sized [[bird]] in the [[family(biology)|family]] [[Picathartidae]] with a long neck and tail. Also known as the '''Grey-necked Picathartes''', this [[passerine]] is mainly found in rocky areas of close-canopied rainforest from southwest Nigeria through Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and southwest Gabon. It additionally lives on the island of [[Bioko]]. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often isolated from each other. The rockfowl typically chooses to live near streams and [[inselberg]]s in its forested habitat. It has no recognized subspecies, though some believe that it forms a [[superspecies]] with its close relative, the [[White-necked Rockfowl]]. The Grey-necked Rockfowl has grey upperparts, a light grey breast, and lemon-coloured underparts. Its unusually long tail is used for balance, and its thighs are muscular. The head is nearly featherless, with the exposed skin being powder blue on the forehead and upper [[mandible]] and carmine on the hindcrown. The bird<U+2019>s cheeks and eyes are covered in a large, circular black patch that, though narrow, connects and divides the carmine and powder blue skin at the peak of the crown. Though the bird is usually silent, some calls are known.

This rockfowl feeds primarily on insects, though some plant matter, such as fruit and flower buds, is eaten. One feeding strategy involves following ''[[Dorylus]]'' army ant swarms, feeding on [[Ant-follower|insects flushed by the ants]]. Rockfowl move through the forest mainly through a series of hops and bounds, or short flights in low vegetation. It travels either alone or in small groups. This species rarely flies for long distances. The Grey-necked Rockfowl is [[monogamous]] and pairs nest either alone or in the vicinity of other pairs, sometimes in colonies of two to five nests, though one colony of forty nests has been recorded. These nests are constructed out of mud and are formed into a deep cup that is built on rock surfaces, typically in caves or on cliffs. Two eggs are laid twice a year. Though the birds breed in colonies, infanticide exists in this species, with rockfowl attempting to kill the young of other pairs. Nestlings mature in about a month. 

This species is classified as [[vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] as its dwindling and fragmented populations are threatened by habitat destruction. A conservation plan has been drawn up for this species, and research into its current distribution is ongoing. Some of the indigenous peoples of Cameroon either respect this species or, in some cases, fear it. Today, this rockfowl is considered one of Africa<U+2019>s most desirable birds by [[birder]]s and is a symbol of [[ecotourism]] across its range.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Mont-Cameroun.jpg|thumb|alt=Mount Cameroon emerges through the clouds in the background, while the foreground depicts dense rainforest|The forests around [[Mount Cameroon]] are a nesting area]]
The Grey-necked Rockfowl is found in West Africa from southeast Nigeria to southwest Gabon.<ref name="BL"/> In Nigeria, it is only found in the nation's southeastern corner near the coast and the Cameroon border.<ref name="Fry4"/> The species is widespread in southwestern Cameroon, and this country is considered to be the species' stronghold.<ref name="Awa"/> It is found throughout Equatorial Guinea and into southwestern Gabon.<ref name="BL"/> Additionally, the species resides in the southwestern forests of the island of [[Bioko]] in the [[Gulf of Guinea]].<ref name="Fry4"/> There is only one record of this species from the Republic of the Congo, though it is suspected that the rockfowl may have an undiscovered population in this country.<ref name="IAPlan"/><ref name="HBW60"/> The Grey-necked Rockfowl's total range covers approximately {{convert|314,000|km2|sqmi|lk=on}}.<ref name="BL"/>

It is found in undisturbed rain forests with closed canopies.<ref name="BL"/> The Grey-necked Rockfowl prefers rugged terrain in these forests covered in large boulders, caves, and gorges.<ref name="Fry5"/> Additionally, it often found near [[inselberg]]s and a source of water, either a river or a forest pool.<ref name="HBW61"/> The understory of its forests has sparse undergrowth or open spaces but is covered in mosses, ferns, [[liana]]s, and [[epiphytes]].<ref name="Fry5"/> In southwestern [[Bioko]] it is found in low forests that receive nearly {{convert|10|m|ft}} of rain a year.<ref name="Fry5"/> Bioko's habitat also has dense undergrowth and vertical gorges near a [[caldera]].<ref name="Fry5"/> The rockfowl's habitat is normally found between {{convert|450|and|2100|m|ft}} above sea level, though it is lower in elevation on Bioko.<ref name="Fry5"/> This species is non-migratory, and at one site in Cameroon the birds remained within {{convert|300|m|ft}} of their nesting site throughout the year.<ref name="Fry6"/> It is capable of living near human activity, and one breeding site in Cameroon was located within {{convert|30|m|ft}} of a [[maize]] plot.<ref name="HBW61"/> This and other recent observations suggest that the rockfowl has greater tolerance for degraded habitat than previously thought.<ref name="BL"/>

==Ecology and behavior==
This rockfowl usually lives either alone or in pairs, although small flocks of three to ten birds are not uncommon.<ref name="Fry5"/> It normally moves through its habitat in a series of runs and long, springing hops on the ground and in low branches.<ref name="Fry5"/> It uses its tail for balance while hopping and running.<ref name="HBW61"/> When in a flock, rockfowl hop almost in unison.<ref name="Fry6"/> In the unusual occurrences when the species does fly, it is fast and is capable of navigating through the trees and rocks well.<ref name="Fry6"/> When it is standing still, the rockfowl has its tail down and its head looking up.<ref name="Fry6"/> Typically, it silently evades any unusual movements in their forest.<ref name="HBW62">{{Harvnb|Thompson|2007|p=62}}</ref> However, if these birds know that they have been sighted, they can become quite inquisitive and occasionally approach observers.<ref name="HBW62"/> This is not a shy species once it knows that it has been seen, and often studies things of interest, including humans, from an open location.<ref name="Fry6"/> When this species is suspicious, it raises the small crown on its head and the ruff on its neck while uttering a muffled groan.<ref name="Fry6"/> It is most active in the early morning and late evening, and from 10:30 am to 7:00 pm remains perched with little activity either in [[liana]]-tangled areas or in caves away from the nests.<ref name="Fry6"/> To scratch its head, the species lifts its foot over its head.<ref name="Simmons">{{cite journal  | last = Simmons  | first = K.

===Diet===
[[File:Lepisma saccharina 1a.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A long insect with shiny, silvery skin, long antenna, and six legs near its head is on a white background.|A [[silverfish]], one of the rockfowl's prey items]]
This species forages in the early morning or late afternoon either alone or in small groups in leaf litter and on dead tree trunks.<ref name="Fry6"/> It is also known to leap upwards to grab prey on overhanging foliage.<ref name="Fry6"/> It looks for its prey either by standing still and scanning the surrounding area or by tossing the leaf litter away with its beak.<ref name="Fry6"/> It also frequently follows columns of ''[[Dorylus]]'' ants, feeding on the insects flushed by the ants.<ref name="BL"/> It also is known to hunt in streams for crabs and fish.<ref name="HBW63">{{Harvnb|Thompson|2007|p=63}}</ref> It crushes snails with its beak and, if its prey struggles, smashes it against the ground.<ref name="Fry6"/> While an uncommon occurrence, male rockfowl have been observed giving food to a female.<ref name="Adeyemo"/>

The Grey-necked Rockfowl feeds on a diverse range of invertebrates and small [[vertebrate]]s, though plant matter does constitute a major part of its diet.<ref name="Fry6">{{Harvnb|Fry|2000|p=6}}</ref><ref name="Adeyemo"/> It is known to eat beetles, including [[weevil]]s, [[rove beetle]]s, and [[click beetle]]s from the genus ''[[Psephus]]'', [[butterflies]], ants from the genera ''[[Dorylus]]'' and ''[[Pachycondyla]]'', [[grasshopper]]s, cockroaches from the family [[Blattidae]], [[earwig]]s, [[caterpillar]]s, [[ant-lion]]s, [[silverfish]], and earthworms.<ref name="Fry6"/> Small lizards, frogs, snails, and slugs are also eaten, as are crabs from the genus ''[[Potamon]]'', [[fruit]]s, flower buds, [[moss]]es, and [[leaves]].<ref name="Fry6"/><ref name="Adeyemo"/> Fish have also been identified as a prey item in Nigeria.<ref name="HBW63"/> At at least one nesting site, it relies heavily on the arthropods feeding on the bat [[guano]] near the cave for sustenance, while this behaviour has been reported to a lesser extent at other sites.<ref name="Fry6"/><ref name="HBW69">{{Harvnb|Thompson|2007|p=69}}</ref> It is known to regurgitate what it has eaten in pellet form.<ref name="Fry6"/> Overall, between 52 and 60 percent of the bird's diet is believed to be composed of animals.<ref name=" Adeyemo ">{{cite journal  | last = Adeyemo | first = A.

===Reproduction===
The Grey-necked Rockfowl breeds either alone or in small colonies averaging two to five nests in size, though nearly fifty nests are present at one site.<ref name="IAPlan"/> It is [[monogamy|monogamous]] and therefore does not breed with rockfowl other than its mate.<ref name="Fry6"/> It is believed to breed cooperatively in Equatorial Guinea, as four different birds were observed feeding one nest.<ref name="Harter"/> The rockfowl's courtship displays are unknown.<ref name="Fry6"/> The timing of the egg laying in a colony is not synchronized, leading to various stages of development of nestlings within the colony.<ref name="Fry6"/> It has been suggested that this is to promote cooperative breeding.<ref name="Harter"/> The laying dates also vary by region, typically coinciding with a few weeks before the onset of the wet season;<ref name="Harter"/> in areas where the wet season is bimodal, two different breeding seasons occur.<ref name="IAPlan"/> However, in mountainous regions such as Mount Cameroon, it breeds during the dry season to avoid the frequent mists of the wet season.<ref name="HBW63"/> Birds in Nigeria lay their eggs between August and November, birds in Gabon lay between November and April, birds in western Cameroon lay between March and November with peaks of June, July, and October, and birds in southern Cameroon have two breeding seasons, a main one from October to December and a secondary one lasting from April to May.<ref name="Fry7">{{Harvnb|Fry|2000|p=7}}</ref> In Equatorial Guinea, nesting occurs in mid-February.<ref name="Harter"/>

This rockfowl builds its nest onto the sides of rocks, normally in caves, where nests are built both by the entrance and deep within, or on nearly vertical cliff faces, which can be either bare or have some vegetation, though never woody branches, near the nest.<ref name="Fry6"/> Nests need to be built under an overhang to protect it from water, and the rock surface normally slopes forward slightly.<ref name="HBW63"/> The nests are almost always found near water, which can be in the form of either streams or forest pools.<ref name="Harter"/> These streams, particularly those located at the base of a nesting cliff, help keep predators away from the nests.<ref name="BL"/> Nests on rock surfaces are normally built {{convert|1.2|to|5.2|m|ft}} above the ground.<ref name="Fry6"/> In addition to the rock face nests, there is a record of a nest being constructed on the [[buttress root]] of a ''[[Piptadeniastrum]]'' tree above a small stream.<ref name="HBW63"/> Two nests were even built onto a concrete bridge in Gabon's [[Lop<U+00E9> National Park]].<ref name="Christy">{{cite journal  | last = Christy  | first = Patrice | coauthors = Fiona Maisels  | title = Grey-necked Picathartes ''Picathartes oreas'' use man-made structures to breed  | journal = Malimbus  | volume = 29  | issue = 2  | pages = 126<U+2013>128  | publisher = West African Ornithological Society  | location = Zaria, Nigeria  | date = September 2007}}</ref> The male and female rockfowl work equally on the nest's construction, and it can take two to three months to build one, though in some extreme cases it takes more than a year.<ref name="Fry6"/> The nest itself is a half-cup constructed of dry mud with grass fibres and dead leaves mixed in, often with the plant matter sticking out of the nest's walls.<ref name="Fry6"/> It is either built onto the rock surface or, in some cases, is built more like a retaining wall across the opening of a small rock fissure.<ref name="Fry6"/> Nests are built at least away {{convert|1|m|ft}} from each other, and in some cases up to {{convert|5|m|ft}}.<ref name="Harter"/> The nest is normally {{convert|30|to|40|cm|in}} thick, though the nest is uneven in its construction and one nest was {{convert|140|cm|in}} thick.<ref name="Fry6"/> It is about {{convert|290|cm|in}} wide and {{convert|400|cm|in}} long and weighs about {{convert|3|kg|lb}}.<ref name="Fry6"/> However, nest sizes do have a large degree of variability.<ref name="HBW64">{{Harvnb|Thompson|2007|p=64}}</ref> After the mud dries, it becomes a very hard structure.<ref name="Fry6"/> The inside of the nest is lined with rootlets and thin strips of grass.<ref name="Fry6"/>

In Cameroon, the Grey-necked Rockfowl is respected by the indigenous peoples and, in some cases, even feared.<ref name="IAPlan"/> It is known by many names to the indigenous peoples of Nigeria, with most of the translating to "bird of the rocks" or "fowl of the stream".<ref name="Ash">{{cite journal  | last = Ash  | first = John | title = The Grey-necked Picathartes ''Picathartes oreas'' and Ibadan Malimbe ''Malimbus ibadanensis'' in Nigeria  | journal = Bird Conservation International| volume = 1  | issue =  2 | pages = 93<U+2013>106  | publisher = BirdLife International  | location = Cambridge| url = http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FBCI%2FBCI1_02%2FS0959270900001982a.pdf&code=0e010f7401424d07559d97c60a9e146d  | date = June 1991}}</ref> Hunters sheltering in the rockfowl's nesting caves have been known to kill and eat adult rockfowl, though it is generally thought to be too small to eat and is left for children to hunt.<ref name="Fry7"/><ref name="Ash"/> In the 1950s and 1960s, western zoos desired this species, leading to a large demand to collect the rockfowl for display.<ref name="HBW67">{{Harvnb|Thompson|2007|p=67}}</ref> British conservationist and author [[Gerald Durrell]] made this species a target on two of his trips to Cameroon, which he describes in ''[[The Bafut Beagles]]'' and ''[[A Zoo in My Luggage]]''.<ref name="Earthwatch"/> The trade of this species is non-existent today, and, as the zoo population did not sustain itself despite sporadic breeding, the last captive rockfowl died at the [[Frankfurt Zoo]] in 2009.<ref name="Zoos">{{cite web  | title = Grey-necked Picathartes  | publisher = Zootierliste  | year = 2009  | url = http://www.zootierliste.de/en/?klasse=2&ordnung=222&familie=22213&art=2221302&haltungen=2  | accessdate = 2011-11-15}}</ref><ref name="HBW67"/> The Grey-necked Rockfowl has been depicted on numerous postage stamps from Cameroon and Nigeria, as well as stamps from Benin and Togo, where it does not live.<ref name="stamp">{{cite web|author=Scharning, Kjell|title=Grey-necked Rockfowl Stamps| publisher = Theme Birds on Stamps |url=http://www.birdtheme.org/mainlyimages/index.php?spec=1826|accessdate=2011-11-15}}</ref> It is considered one of the most difficult species of bird to see in the wild.<ref name="French"/> The Grey-necked Rockfowl is a symbol for both conservation and ecotourism efforts in its range.<ref name="HBW67"/> This species is considered one of the five most desirable birds in Africa by ornithologists.<ref name="Matthiessen">{{cite book  | last = Matthiessen  | first = Peter  | authorlink = Peter Matthiessen| title = African Silences  | publisher = Random House| year = 1991  | location = New York  | page = 56  | isbn =0-679-40021-4}}</ref>

Cameroon is the only nation with a national law protecting this species.<ref name="IAPlan"/> This law prohibits killing the rockfowl, though it can be captured with a proper permit.<ref name="BL"/> International trading of the Grey-necked Rockfowl is governed under [[CITES]] Appendix I, meaning that legal trading of this species is only authorized in extraordinary circumstances.<ref name="HBW67"/> In 2006 [[BirdLife International]] drafted an international action plan to provide strategies for protecting this species.<ref name="IAPlan"/> This plan focused on surveying the remaining habitat, raising awareness amongst the local populace, and limiting the continued destruction of its habitat.<ref name="IAPlan"/>

This rockfowl is protected in some of the areas in which it lives by national parks.<ref name="IAPlan"/> Additionally, there seems to be little habitat destruction in Gabon and on Bioko as the locations in these places in which the rockfowl lives is believed to be too inaccessible for future human development.<ref name="BL"/> Recent surveys have also discovered new populations of the Grey-necked Rockfowl.<ref name="APSBA">{{cite web  | title = African Partnerships for Sustainable Biodiversity Action  | publisher = BirdLife International | year = 2011  | url = http://www.birdlife.org/action/capacity/african_psba/index.html  | accessdate =2011-11-15 }}</ref>
