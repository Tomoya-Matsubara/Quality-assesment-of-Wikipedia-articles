The '''kidneys''' are bean shaped [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] that serve several essential regulatory roles in [[vertebrate]] [[animal]]s. They are essential in the [[urinary system]] and also serve [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] functions such as the regulation of [[electrolyte]]s, maintenance of [[acid<U+2013>base homeostasis|acid<U+2013>base balance]], and regulation of [[blood pressure]] (via maintaining salt and water balance). They serve the body as a natural filter of the [[blood]], and remove wastes, which are diverted to the [[urinary bladder]]. In producing [[urine]], the kidneys excrete wastes such as [[urea]] and [[ammonium]], and they are also responsible for the reabsorption of [[water]], [[glucose]], and [[amino acid]]s. The kidneys also produce [[hormone]]s including [[calcitriol]], [[erythropoietin]], and the enzyme [[renin]].

Located at the rear of the [[abdominal cavity]] in the [[retroperitoneum]], the kidneys receive blood from the paired [[renal artery|renal arteries]], and drain into the paired [[renal vein]]s. Each kidney excretes urine into a [[ureter]], itself a paired structure that empties into the [[urinary bladder]].

[[Renal physiology]] is the study of kidney function, while [[nephrology]] is the medical specialty concerned with [[kidney disease]]s. Diseases of the kidney are diverse, but individuals with kidney disease frequently display characteristic clinical features. Common clinical conditions involving the kidney include the [[nephritic syndrome|nephritic]] and [[nephrotic syndrome]]s, [[renal cyst]]s, [[acute kidney injury]], [[chronic kidney disease]], [[urinary tract infection]], [[nephrolithiasis]], and [[urinary tract obstruction]].<ref name="robbins">{{cite book |author=Cotran, RS S.; Kumar, Vinay; Fausto, Nelson; Robbins, Stanley L.; Abbas, Abul K. |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, MO |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-0187-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Various cancers of the kidney exist; the most common adult renal cancer is [[renal cell carcinoma]]. Cancers, cysts, and some other renal conditions can be managed with removal of the kidney, or [[nephrectomy]]. When renal function, measured by [[glomerular filtration rate]], is persistently poor, [[dialysis]] and [[kidney transplantation]] may be treatment options. Although they are not normally harmful, [[kidney stone]]s can be painful and repeated, chronic formation of stones can scar the kidneys. The removal of kidney stones involves [[ultrasound]] treatment to break up the stones into smaller pieces, which are then passed through the urinary tract. One common symptom of kidney stones is a sharp to disabling pain in the medial/lateral segments of the lower back or groin.

<!--This should eventually incorporate all the vocabulary within the "Terms" section-->
The kidney has a [[bean]]-shaped structure; each kidney has a [[wikt:convex|convex]] and [[wikt:concave|concave]] surface. The concave surface, the [[renal hilum]], is the point at which the [[renal artery]] enters the organ, and the [[renal vein]] and [[ureter]] leave. The kidney is surrounded by tough fibrous tissue, the [[renal capsule]], which is itself surrounded by [[perinephric fat]], [[renal fascia]] (of [[Dimitrie Gerota|Gerota]]) and [[paranephric fat]]. The anterior (front) border of these tissues is the [[peritoneum]], while the posterior (rear) border is the [[transversalis fascia]].

The superior border of the right kidney is adjacent to the liver; and the [[spleen]], for the left kidney. Therefore, both move down on inhalation.

The kidney is approximately 11<U+2013>14&nbsp;cm in length, 6&nbsp;cm wide and 4&nbsp;cm thick.

The substance, or [[parenchyma]], of the kidney is divided into two major structures: superficial is the [[renal cortex]] and deep is the [[renal medulla]]. Grossly, these structures take the shape of 8 to 18 cone-shaped [[renal lobe]]s, each containing renal cortex surrounding a portion of medulla called a [[renal pyramid]] (of [[Marcello Malpighi|Malpighi]]).<ref name="boron"/> Between the renal pyramids are projections of cortex called [[renal column]]s (of [[Exupere Joseph Bertin|Bertin]]). [[Nephron]]s, the urine-producing functional structures of the kidney, span the cortex and medulla. The initial filtering portion of a nephron is the [[renal corpuscle]], located in the cortex, which is followed by a [[renal tubule]] that passes from the cortex deep into the medullary pyramids. Part of the renal cortex, a [[medullary ray (anatomy)|medullary ray]] is a collection of renal tubules that drain into a single [[collecting duct]].

The tip, or [[renal papilla|papilla]], of each pyramid empties urine into a [[minor calyx]]; minor calyces empty into [[major calyces]], and major calyces empty into the [[renal pelvis]], which becomes the ureter. At the hilum, the ureter and renal vein exit the kidney while the renal artery enters. Surrounding these structures is hilar fat and lymphatic tissue with lymph nodes. The hilar fat is contiguous with a fat-filled cavity called the [[renal sinus]]. The renal sinus collectively contains the renal pelvis and calyces and separates these structures from the renal medullary tissue.<ref>Clapp, WL. "Renal Anatomy".

===Blood supply===
[[File:3D rendered CT of abdominal aortic branches and kidneys.svg|thumb|3D-rendered [[x-ray computed tomography|computed tomography]], showing renal arteries and veins.]]

The kidneys receive blood from the [[renal artery|renal arteries]], left and right, which branch directly from the [[abdominal aorta]]. Despite their relatively small size, the kidneys receive approximately 20% of the [[cardiac output]].<ref name="boron"/>

Each renal artery branches into segmental arteries, dividing further into [[interlobar arteries]], which penetrate the renal capsule and extend through the renal columns between the renal pyramids. The interlobar arteries then supply blood to the [[arcuate arteries]] that run through the boundary of the cortex and the medulla. Each arcuate artery supplies several [[interlobular]] arteries that feed into the [[afferent arteriole]]s that supply the [[glomerulus|glomeruli]].

The '''interstitium''' is the functional space in the kidney beneath the individual filters (glomeruli), which are rich in [[blood vessels]]. The interstitum absorbs fluid recovered from [[urine]]. Various conditions can lead to [[scarring]] and [[:wikt:congestion|congestion]] of this area, which can cause kidney dysfunction and failure.

After filtration occurs the blood moves through a small network of venules that converge into interlobular veins. As with the arteriole distribution the veins follow the same pattern, the interlobular provide blood to the arcuate veins then back to the interlobar veins, which come to form the renal vein exiting the kidney for transfusion for blood.

===Histology===<!--Interstitial kidney cell redirects here-->
[[File:Kidney-medulla.JPG|thumb|Microscopic photograph of the [[renal medulla]]]]
[[File:Kidney-Cortex.JPG|thumb|Microscopic photograph of the [[renal cortex]]]]

Renal [[histology]] studies the structure of the kidney as viewed under a [[microscope]]. Various distinct [[cell type]]s occur in the kidney, including:
*Kidney glomerulus parietal cell
*[[Kidney glomerulus podocyte]]
*[[Kidney proximal tubule brush border cell]]
*[[Loop of Henle thin segment cell]]
*[[Thick ascending limb]] cell
*[[Kidney distal tubule cell]]
*[[Kidney collecting duct cell (disambiguation)|Kidney collecting duct cell]]
*Interstitial kidney cells
*Renal arteries and their branches
The renal artery enters into the kidney at the level of first lumbar vertebra just below the superior mesenteric artery. As it enters the kidney it divides into branches: first the segmental artery, which divides into 2 or 3 lobar arteries, then further divides into interlobar arteries, which further divide into the arcuate artery, which leads into the interlobular artery, which form afferent arterioles. The afferent arterioles form the glomerulus (network of capillaries closed in Bowman's capsule). From here, efferent arterioles leaves the glomerulus and divide into peritubular capillaries, which drain into the interlobular veins and then into arcuate vein and then into interlobar vein, which runs into lobar vein, which opens into the segmental vein and which drains into the renal vein, and then from it blood moves into the inferior vena cava.

===Innervation===
The kidney and [[nervous system]] communicate via the [[renal plexus]], whose fibers course along the renal arteries to reach each kidney.<ref name="Bard">{{cite book |author=Bard, Johnathan; Vize, Peter D.; Woolf, Adrian S. |title=The kidney: from normal development to congenital disease |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=2003 |page=154 |isbn=0-12-722441-6 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ctOm-cPwo60C&pg=PA154 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Input from the [[sympathetic nervous system]] triggers [[vasoconstriction]] in the kidney, thereby reducing [[renal blood flow]].<ref name="Bard"/> The kidney also receives input from the [[parasympathetic nervous system]], by way of the renal branches of the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X); the function of this is yet unclear.<ref name="Bard"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Schrier|first=Robert W.|title=Mechanism of the Antidiuretic Effect Associated with Interruption of Parasympathetic Pathways|journal=Journal Clinical Investigation|year=1972|pmc=332960|pmid=5056657|doi=10.1172/JCI107079|volume=51|issue=10|pages=2613<U+2013>20|last2=Berl|first2=Tomas|last3=Harbottle|first3=Judith A.}}</ref> Sensory input from the kidney travels to the T10-11 levels of the [[spinal cord]] and is sensed in the corresponding [[dermatome (anatomy)|dermatome]].<ref name="Bard"/> Thus, pain in the flank region may be referred from corresponding kidney.<ref name="Bard"/>

==Functions==
{{main|Renal physiology}}

The kidney participates in whole-body [[homeostasis]], regulating [[acid-base balance]], [[electrolyte]] concentrations, [[extracellular fluid volume]], and regulation of [[blood pressure]]. The kidney accomplishes these homeostatic functions both independently and in concert with other organs, particularly those of the [[endocrine system]]. Various endocrine hormones coordinate these endocrine functions; these include [[renin]], [[angiotensin II]], [[aldosterone]], [[antidiuretic hormone]], and [[atrial natriuretic peptide]], among others.

Many of the kidney's functions are accomplished by relatively simple mechanisms of filtration, reabsorption, and secretion, which take place in the [[nephron]]. Filtration, which takes place at the [[renal corpuscle]], is the process by which cells and large proteins are filtered from the blood to make an ultrafiltrate that eventually becomes urine. The kidney generates 180 liters of filtrate a day, while reabsorbing a large percentage, allowing for the generation of only approximately 2 liters of urine. Reabsorption is the transport of molecules from this ultrafiltrate and into the blood. Secretion is the reverse process, in which molecules are transported in the opposite direction, from the blood into the urine.

===Excretion of wastes===
The kidneys excrete a variety of waste products produced by [[metabolism]]. These include the nitrogenous wastes called "[[urea]]", from protein [[catabolism]], as well as [[uric acid]], from [[nucleic acid]] metabolism. Formation of urine is also the function of the kidney. The concentration of nitrogenous wastes, in the urine of mammals and some birds, is dependent on an elaborate [[countercurrent multiplication]] system. This requires several independent nephron characteristics to operate: a tight hair pin configuration of the tubules, water and ion permeability in the descending limb of the loop, water impermeability in the ascending loop and active ion transport out of most of the ascending loop. In addition, [[countercurrent exchange]] by the vessels carrying the blood supply to the nephron is essential for enabling this function.

===Reabsorption of vital nutrients===
Glucose at normal plasma levels is completely reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. The mechanism for this is the Na<sup>+</sup>/glucose cotransporter. A plasma level of 350&nbsp;mg/dL will fully saturate the transporters and glucose will be lost in the urine. A plasma glucose level of approximately 160 is sufficient to allow glucosuria, which is an important clinical clue to diabetes mellitus.

Amino acids are reabsorbed by sodium dependent transporters in the proximal tubule. [[Hartnup's disease]] is a deficiency of the tryptophan amino acid transporter, which results in [[pellagra]].<ref name="Tao p 1">Le, Tao. ''First Aid for the USMLE Step 1'' 2013.

Pregnancy reduces the reabsorption of glucose and amino acids.

===Acid-base homeostasis===
{{main|Acid-base homeostasis}}

Two organ systems, the kidneys and lungs, maintain acid-base homeostasis, which is the maintenance of [[pH]] around a relatively stable value. The lungs contribute to acid-base homeostasis by regulating [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentration.
The kidneys have two very important roles in maintaining the acid-base balance: to reabsorb bicarbonate from urine, and to excrete [[hydrogen]] ions into urine

===Osmolality regulation===
Any significant rise in [[plasma osmolality]] is detected by the [[hypothalamus]], which communicates directly with the [[posterior pituitary gland]]. An increase in osmolality causes the gland to secrete [[antidiuretic hormone]] (ADH), resulting in water reabsorption by the kidney and an increase in urine concentration. The two factors work together to return the plasma osmolality to its normal levels.

ADH binds to principal cells in the collecting duct that translocate aquaporins to the membrane, allowing water to leave the normally impermeable membrane and be reabsorbed into the body by the vasa recta, thus increasing the plasma volume of the body.

There are two systems that create a hyperosmotic medulla and thus increase the body plasma volume: Urea recycling and the 'single effect.'

Urea is usually excreted as a waste product from the kidneys. However, when plasma blood volume is low and ADH is released the aquaporins that are opened are also permeable to urea. This allows urea to leave the collecting duct into the medulla creating a hyperosmotic solution that 'attracts' water. Urea can then re-enter the nephron and be excreted or recycled again depending on whether ADH is still present or not.

The 'Single effect' describes the fact that the ascending thick limb of the [[loop of Henle]] is not permeable to water but is permeable to NaCl. This allows for a [[countercurrent exchange]] system whereby the medulla becomes increasingly concentrated, but at the same time setting up an osmotic gradient for water to follow should the aquaporins of the collecting duct be opened by ADH.

===Blood pressure regulation===
{{main|Blood pressure regulation|Renin-angiotensin system}}

Although the kidney cannot directly sense blood, long-term regulation of [[blood pressure]] predominantly depends upon the kidney. This primarily occurs through maintenance of the [[extracellular fluid]] compartment, the size of which depends on the plasma [[sodium]] concentration. Renin is the first in a series of important chemical messengers that make up the [[renin-angiotensin system]]. Changes in renin ultimately alter the output of this system, principally the hormones [[angiotensin II]] and [[aldosterone]]. Each hormone acts via multiple mechanisms, but both increase the kidney's absorption of [[sodium chloride]], thereby expanding the extracellular fluid compartment and raising blood pressure. When renin levels are elevated, the concentrations of angiotensin II and aldosterone increase, leading to increased sodium chloride reabsorption, expansion of the extracellular fluid compartment, and an increase in blood pressure. Conversely, when renin levels are low, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels decrease, contracting the extracellular fluid compartment, and decreasing blood pressure.

===Hormone secretion===
The kidneys secrete a variety of [[hormones]], including [[erythropoietin]], and the enzyme [[renin]]. [[Erythropoietin]] is released in response to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (low levels of oxygen at tissue level) in the renal circulation. It stimulates [[erythropoiesis]] (production of red blood cells) in the [[bone marrow]]. [[Calcitriol]], the activated form of [[vitamin D]], promotes intestinal absorption of [[calcium]] and the renal [[reabsorption]] of [[phosphate]]. Part of the [[renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system]], renin is an [[enzyme]] involved in the regulation of [[aldosterone]] levels.

==Development==
{{Main|Kidney development}}

The mammalian kidney develops from [[intermediate mesoderm]]. [[Kidney development]], also called ''nephrogenesis'', proceeds through a series of three successive phases, each marked by the development of a more advanced pair of kidneys: the pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros.<ref>{{cite book | author = Bruce M.

==Evolutionary adaptation==
Kidneys of various animals show evidence of evolutionary [[adaptation]] and have long been studied in [[ecophysiology]] and [[comparative physiology]].

Kidney Failure
{{main|Renal failure}}

Generally, humans can live normally with just one kidney, as one has more functioning renal tissue than is needed to survive. Only when the amount of functioning kidney tissue is greatly diminished does one develop [[chronic kidney disease]]. [[Renal replacement therapy]], in the form of [[dialysis]] or [[kidney transplantation]], is indicated when the [[glomerular filtration rate]] has fallen very low or if the renal dysfunction leads to severe symptoms.

=== Diagnosis ===

==== Clinical ====
Many renal diseases are diagnosed on the basis of classical clinical findings. A physician (usually a [[nephrologist]]) begins by taking a detailed clinical history and performs a physical examination. In addition to medical history and presenting symptoms, a physician will ask about medication history, family history recent infections, toxic/chemical exposures and other historical factors that may indicate an etiology for the patient's renal disease. Often, some diseases are suggested by clinical history and time course alone. For example, in a formerly healthy child with a recent upper respiratory tract infection and facial/lower limb swelling, findings of proteinuria on urinalysis, a diagnosis of minimal change disease is highly suggested. Similarly, a patient with a history of diabetes who presents with decreased urine output is most likely to be suffering from diabetic nephropathy. Often, such cases do not require extensive workup (such as with renal biopsy). A presumptive diagnosis can be made on the basis of history, physical exam and supportive laboratory studies.

==== Laboratory ====
Laboratory studies are an important adjunct to clinical evaluation for assessment of renal function. An initial workup of a patient may include a complete blood count (CBC); serum electrolytes including sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, and phosphorus; blood urea, nitrogen and [[creatinine]]; blood glucose and glycocylated hemoglobin.

Urine studies may include urine electrolytes, creatinine, protein, fractional excretion of sodium (FENA) and other studies to assist in evaluation of the etiology of a patient's renal disease.

[[Urinalysis]] is used to evaluate urine for its pH, protein, glucose, specific gravity and the presence of blood/hemoglobin. Microscopic analysis can be helpful in the identification of casts, red blood cells, white blood cells and crystals.<ref name="uptodate.com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu"/>

==== Imaging studies ====
Imaging studies are important in the evaluation of structural renal disease caused by urinary tract obstruction, renal stones, renal cyst, mass lesions, renal vascular disease, and vesicoureteral reflux.<ref name="uptodate.com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu"/>

Imaging techniques used most frequently include renal ultrasound and helical CT scan. Patients with suspected vesicoureteral reflux may undergo voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG).

==== Renal biopsy ====
The role of the renal biopsy is to diagnose renal disease in which the etiology is not clear based upon noninvasive means (clinical history, past medical history, medication history, physical exam, laboratory studies, imaging studies).

A detailed description of renal biopsy interpretation is beyond the scope of this article. In general, a renal pathologist will perform a detailed morphological evaluation and integrate the morphologic findings with the clinical history and laboratory data, ultimately arriving at a pathological diagnosis. A renal [[pathologist]] is a physician who has undergone general training in anatomic pathology and additional specially training in the interpretation of renal biopsy specimens.

Ideally, multiple core sections are obtained and evaluated for adequacy (presence of glomeruli) intraoperatively. A pathologist/pathology assistant divides the specimen(s) for submission for light microscopy, immunofluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy. 

The pathologist will examine the specimen using light microscopy with multiple staining techniques (hematoxylin and eosin/H&E, PAS, trichrome, silver stain) on multiple level sections. Multiple immunofluorescence stains are performed to evaluate for antibody, protein and complement deposition. Finally, ultra-structural examination is performed with electron microscopy and may reveal the presence of electron-dense deposits or other characteristic abnormalities that may suggest an etiology for the patient's renal disease.

==Calculations==
Calculations of kidney performance are an important part of physiology and can be estimated using the calculations below.

===Filtration Fraction===
The filtration fraction is the amount of plasma that is actually filtered through the kidney. This can be defined using the equation:

{{math|''FF''{{=}}{{sfrac|GFR|RPF}}}}

* FF is the filtration fraction
* GFR is the glomerular filtration rate
* RPF is the renal plasma flow
Normal human FF is 20%.

===Renal Clearance===
Renal clearance is the volume of plasma from which the substance is completely cleared from the blood per unit time.

{{math|''C''<sub>''x''</sub>{{=}}(''U''<sub>''x''</sub>){{sfrac|V|P<sub>''x''</sub>}}}}
* {{math|''C''<sub>''x''</sub>}} is the clearance of X (normally in units of mL/min.
* {{math|''U''<sub>''x''</sub>}} is the urine concentration of X.
* {{math|''P''<sub>''x''</sub>}} is the plasma concentration of X.
* {{math|''V''}} is the urine flow rate.

==In other animals==
[[File:Kidney.JPG|thumb|A pig's kidney opened.]]
In the majority of vertebrates, the [[mesonephros]] persists into the adult, albeit usually fused with the more advanced [[metanephros]]; only in [[amniote]]s is the mesonephros restricted to the embryo. The kidneys of [[fish]] and [[amphibian]]s are typically narrow, elongated organs, occupying a significant portion of the trunk. The collecting ducts from each cluster of nephrons usually drain into an ''archinephric duct'', which is [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with the [[vas deferens]] of amniotes. However, the situation is not always so simple; in [[cartilaginous fish]] and some amphibians, there is also a shorter duct, similar to the amniote ureter, which drains the posterior (metanephric) parts of the kidney, and joins with the archinephric duct at the [[bladder]] or [[cloaca]]. Indeed, in many cartilaginous fish, the anterior portion of the kidney may degenerate or cease to function altogether in the adult.<ref name=VB/>

In the most primitive vertebrates, the [[hagfish]] and [[lamprey]]s, the kidney is unusually simple: it consists of a row of nephrons, each emptying directly into the archinephric duct. Invertebrates may possess excretory organs that are sometimes referred to as "kidneys", but, even in ''[[Amphioxus]]'', these are never homologous with the kidneys of vertebrates, and are more accurately referred to by other names, such as [[nephridia]].<ref name=VB/>

The kidneys of [[reptile]]s consist of a number of lobules arranged in a broadly linear pattern. Each lobule contains a single branch of the ureter in its centre, into which the collecting ducts empty. Reptiles have relatively few nephrons compared with other amniotes of a similar size, possibly because of their lower [[metabolic rate]].<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 367<U+2013>376|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>

[[Bird]]s have relatively large, elongated kidneys, each of which is divided into three or more distinct lobes. The lobes consists of several small, irregularly arranged, lobules, each centred on a branch of the ureter. Birds have small glomeruli, but about twice as many nephrons as similarly sized mammals.<ref name=VB/>

The human kidney is fairly typical of that of [[mammal]]s. Distinctive features of the mammalian kidney, in comparison with that of other vertebrates, include the presence of the renal pelvis and renal pyramids, and of a clearly distinguishable cortex and medulla. The latter feature is due to the presence of elongated [[Loop of Henle|loops of Henle]]; these are much shorter in birds, and not truly present in other vertebrates (although the nephron often has a short ''intermediate segment'' between the convoluted tubules). It is only in mammals that the kidney takes on its classical "kidney" shape, although there are some exceptions, such as the multilobed [[reniculate kidney]]s of [[cetacea]]ns.<ref name=VB/>

==History==
The Latin term ''renes'' is related to the English word "reins", a synonym for the kidneys in [[Shakespearean English]] (e.g. ''[[Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' 3.5), which was also the time the [[King James Version]] was translated. Kidneys were once popularly regarded as the seat of the [[conscience]] and reflection,<ref>''The Patient as Person: Explorations in Medical Ethics'' p. 60 by Paul Ramsey, Margaret Farley, Albert Jonsen, William F. May (2002)</ref><ref>''History of Nephrology 2'' p. 235 by International Association for the History of Nephrology Congress, Garabed Eknoyan, Spyros G. Marketos, Natale G. De Santo, 1997; Reprint of ''American Journal of Nephrology''; v. 14, no. 4<U+2013>6, 1994.</ref> and a number of verses in the [[Bible]] (e.g. Ps. 7:9, Rev. 2:23) state that God searches out and inspects the kidneys, or "reins", of humans. Similarly, the [[Talmud]] (''Berakhoth'' 61.a) states that one of the two kidneys counsels what is good, and the other evil.

==Kidneys as food==
[[File:1407871818 5c7f215934 o.jpg|thumb|H<U+00F6>karpanna, Swedish pork and kidney stew]]
The kidneys can be [[cooking|cooked]] and eaten (along with other [[offal]]).

Kidneys are usually grilled or saut<U+00E9>ed, but in more complex dishes they are stewed with a sauce that will improve their flavor. In many preparations, kidneys are combined with pieces of meat or liver, as in [[mixed grill]] or ''meurav Yerushalmi''. Dishes include the [[British cuisine|British]] [[steak and kidney pie]], the [[Swedish cuisine|Swedish]] ''h<U+00F6>karpanna'' (pork and kidney stew), the [[French cuisine|French]] ''rognons de veau sauce moutarde'' (veal kidneys in [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]] sauce) and the [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] ''ri<U+00F1>ones al Jerez'' (kidneys stewed in [[sherry]] sauce) .<ref>[http://cuisine.notrefamille.com/recettes-cuisine/rognons-recette.html Rognons dans les recettes] {{fr}}</ref>
