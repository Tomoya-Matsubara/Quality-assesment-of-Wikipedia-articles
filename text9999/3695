{{nihongo| '''Type 3 Medium Tank ''Chi-Nu'''''|<U+4E09><U+5F0F><U+4E2D><U+6226><U+8ECA> <U+30C1><U+30CC>|San-shiki chusensha Chi-nu}} was a medium tank of [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in [[World War II]]. It was improved version of the [[Type 97 Chi-Ha]] line of by giving it a [[Type 3 75 mm Tank Gun]], one of the largest guns used on Japanese tanks during the war.

The ''Chi-Nu'' did not see combat during the war; they were retained for defence of the Japanese Home Islands in case of an Allied invasion.

==History and development==
Type 3 medium tank ''Chi-Nu'' was developed to cope with the [[United States Army|American]] [[M4 Sherman]] <ref>[http://www3.plala.or.jp/takihome/develop.html Taki]</ref> after it was clear that the [[Type 1 Chi-He]] design was still inadequate. The Army Technical Bureau had been working on the [[Type 4 Chi-To]] medium tank as the counter to the M4 Sherman, but there were problems and delays in the program, and as a result a stopgap tank was required. Development on the Type 3 ''Chi-Nu'' started in May 1943 and was finished by October, just six months later. The low priority given to tank production by 1943 meant that the Type 3 did not actually enter production until 1944, by which time raw materials were in very short supply, and much of Japan's industrial infrastructure had been destroyed by [[Air raids on Japan|American strategic bombing]].

A total of 166 units were produced (55 units in 1944, 111 units in 1945). The Type 3 ''Chi-Nu'' was the last tank that was fielded by the Imperial Japanese armed forces, and was still being produced at the end of the war.<ref name="Zaloga, Japanese Tanks 1939-45">Zaloga, ''Japanese Tanks 1939-45''{{Page needed|date=October 2012}}</ref>

==Design==
The Type 3 Chi-Nu retained the same chassis and [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] of the Type 97 but with a large new hexagonal [[gun turret]].<ref name="Tomczyk, Japanese Armor Vol. 4">Tomczyk, Andrzej, ''Japanese Armor Vol. 4'', p. 3.</ref>

The main armament of the Type 3 Chi-Nu was the 75 mm caliber [[Type 3 75 mm Tank Gun|Type 3 Tank Gun]]. The gun could be elevated between -10 and +25 degrees. Firing a shell at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|680|m/s}} it gave an armor penetration of {{convert|90|mm|in|abbr=on}} at {{convert|100|m|yd|abbr=on}} and {{convert|65|mm|in|abbr=on}} at {{convert|1000|m|yd|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Tomczyk, Japanese Armor Vol. 4"/><ref>[http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_type_3_chi_nu.html History of War]</ref>

==Service record==
The Type 3 was allocated to the [[Japanese home islands]] to defend against the projected [[Operation Downfall|Allied Invasion]]. At least 6 tank regiments were equipped with Type 3 Chi-Nu tanks on [[Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>]] and [[Honsh<U+016B>]], including the [[1st Tank Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|1st Tank Division]] and [[4th Tank Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|4th Tank Division]] based around [[Tokyo]].  As the [[surrender of Japan]] occurred before that invasion, the Type 3 was never used in combat.<ref name="Zaloga, Japanese Tanks 1939-45"/>

One surviving Type 3 medium tank is on display at the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]] Military Ordnance Training School at [[Tsuchiura, Ibaraki]], [[Japan]].
