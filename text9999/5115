'''Daniel Offer''' (December 24, 1929 <U+2013> May 13, 2013) was a psychiatrist whose landmark study of normal adolescents redefined how mental health professionals viewed adolescent development. His 34-year Offer Longitudinal Study showed the unreliability of adolescent memory. His test, the Offer Self Image Questionnaire (OSIQ), was translated into 26 languages and used by researchers around the world. Dr. Offer published 18 books and 69 scientific articles.

== Biography ==

Daniel Offer was born in Berlin, Germany on December 24, 1929. He is the son of Walter Hirsch, M.D. a pediatrician, and Ilse Hirsch, nee Meyer. He is a grandson of Professor [[Ludwig Ferdinand Meyer]], M.D., a pediatric gastroenterologist and Director of the Emperor and Empress Friedrich Children<U+2019>s Hospital in [[Berlin]], Germany. After the rise of Nazism in April of 1933, both his father and his grandfather lost their jobs. The two families immigrated to [[Palestine]] in 1936. Offer grew up in Jerusalem and, in February, 1948, he joined the [[Palmach]] (Strike Force) of the Israeli army. At that time he changed his name from Thomas Edgar Hirsch to Daniel Offer. He left the [[Israel Defense Forces]] as a Staff Sergeant in 1950. He then attended the [[University of Rochester]], in Rochester, New York. He continued his education at the [[University of Chicago]] [[Pritzker School of Medicine]], graduating in 1957.  

Offer served an internship at the [[University of Illinois Medical Center]], Chicago, Illinois followed by a psychiatric residency at [[Michael Reese Hospital]], Chicago, Illinois (1958 to 1961). He remained at Michael Reese until 1990. During that time he was Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry from 1977 to 1987. From 1973 to 1990 he served on the faculty of the University of Chicago Medical School, becoming Professor of Psychiatry in 1974. In 1990 he become Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, attaining emeritus status in 2008.  

Offer was married to Judith Baskin Offer from 1961 until her death in 1976. In 1979 he married Marjorie Kaiz Offer. They were married until his death in 2013. He has three children and six grandchildren.

=== Life on Dialysis ===

In June, 1999 Daniel Offer began [[Dialysis|dialysis]] due to renal failure. In order to help fellow renal patients navigate the world of dialysis, he wrote with his wife, Marjorie Kaiz Offer and his daughter Susan Offer Szafir a guide to dealing with dialysis. The book<ref>Offer, D., Offer, M. Kaiz,  Szafir, S. Offer.  2007. Dialysis Without Fear. Oxford University Press; New York.</ref> incorporates  interviews with  nephrologists, nurses, social workers, dieticians, technicians and dialysis patients and their families.

== Career ==

=== Adolescent Psychiatry ===

==== The Offer Longitudinal Study ====

In 1963 Offer realized that very little was known about the development of normal (i.e. non-patient) adolescents. He received eight years of federal grants to study the psychological development of normal adolescents. In the first phase of the study seventy three boys were selected from two suburban Chicago area high school and followed for eight years. The major finding for the high school phase was that stability and not turmoil, was the overriding characteristic of normal adolescents. This finding contradicted the then current notion of normal development. At that time it was believed that all adolescents go through major turmoil as they move through the high school years. The four years of the post high school phase of the school substantiated this finding. Two books resulted from the adolescent phase of the study.<ref>Offer, D.  1969.  The Psychological World of the Teenager: A Study of  Normal Adolescent Boys. New York: Basic Books, Inc.</ref><ref>Offer, D. and Offer, J.L. 1975. From Teenage to Young Manhood: A  Psychological Study. New York: Basic Books, Inc.</ref>
In 1996-7 94% of the original sample were reinterviewed. They were now 48. The original finding held. All were well adjusted late middle-aged individuals. The major finding was the discovery that well-adjusted adults do not remember their adolescence accurately. The data showed that there is essentially no correlation between what the subjects as adults thought and felt about their adolescence and what they actually thought and felt when they were adolescents. This phase of the study was covered in the book "Regular Guys".<ref>Offer, D., Offer, M. K. and Ostov, E. 2004. Regular Guys, 34 Years Beyond Adolescence, Springer, New York: 2004.</ref>
==== The Offer Self-Image Questionnaire for Adolescents (OSIQ) ====

The OSIQ is a psychological test<ref>Offer, D., Ostrov, E., Howard, K.I., and Dolan, S.  1992.  The Offer Self- Image Questionnaire for Adolescents (OSIQ): A Manual, Completely Revised Fifth Edition. Los Angeles: Western Psychological Services.</ref> developed in 1962 which uses 129 items and twelve scales to assess teenager<U+2019>s adjustment in areas such as impulse control, emotional well-being, peer relationships, family relationships, coping ability and sexuality. Over the years the OSIQ became a popular psychological test used in many countries through out the world. It has been translated into twenty-six languages. Because of this interest, Offer and his colleagues undertook a cross cultural study of the self image of adolescents in ten countries. The major finding was that adolescents growing up in very different countries are, on the whole, more similar to one another than they are different. However, there were some important differences in their psychological makeup.<ref>Offer, D., Ostrov, E. Howard, R. I. and Atkinson, R.  1988. The Teenage World: Adolescents' Self-Image in Ten Countries. New York: Plenum Press.</ref>
The bank of OSIQ data generated by 30,000 adolescents, both normal and psychiatrically disturbed or delinquent, as well as all the data from the Offer Longitudinal Study has been placed in the Daniel Offer and Marjorie Kaiz Offer Archives at the [[Institute for Juvenile Research]], Department of Psychiatry, University of Illinois Medical School, Chicago Illinois.

==== Deviant and Disturbed Adolescents ====

Offer undertook a five year study, 1969 -1974, of psychiatrically disturbed juvenile delinquents.<ref>Offer, D. Marohn, R. C. and Ostrov, E. 1979. The Psychological World of the Juvenile Delinquent. New York: Basic Books, Inc.</ref> This was an empirical study to analyze the makeup of this population and how society can best help them. The authors were in charge of an inpatient unit for this population at the Illinois State Psychiatric Institute, a setting which allowed for an in depth study.	

In the early 1990<U+2019>s Holinger, Offer and colleagues examined the rates of suicide and homicide among adolescents in order to determine the causes and suggest means of prevention.<ref>Holinger, P.C., Offer, D., Barter, J.T. and Bell, C.C. 1994. Suicide and Homicide Among Adolescents. New York: Guilford Press.</ref>
==== The Journal of Youth and Adolescence ====

In 1972 Offer founded The Journal of Youth and Adolescence. He served as editor-in-chief of from 1972 to 2006 at which time he became Editor Emeritus.

=== The Study of Normality ===

During the beginning of the Offer Longitudinal Study, Offer became interested in how mental health professionals defined normality. Working with [[Melvin Sabshin]], they defined the four perspectives of what constitutes normal behavior. They are: normality as health, as utopia, as average and as process.<ref>Offer, D., and Sabshin, M. 1966. Normality: Theoretical and Clinical  Concepts of Mental Health. New York: Basic Books, Inc.</ref><ref>Offer, D., and Sabshin, M. 1974. Normality: Theoretical and Clinical Concepts of Mental Health (Second Edition). New York: Basic Books, Inc. (Revised Edition)</ref> To broaden knowledge of what constitutes normal behavior, Offer and Sabshin with colleagues looked at normality through out life as well as normality in different settings.<ref>Offer, D., and Sabshin, M. (eds.).  1984. Normality and the Life Cycle: A Critical Integration. New York: Basic Books, Inc.</ref><ref>Offer, D., and Sabshin, M. (eds.). (1991). The Diversity of Normality. New York: Basic Books, Inc.</ref>
=== The Study of Leadership ===

In the 1980<U+2019>s Offer pursued his interest in the psychological aspects of leadership by editing a book with Charles B. Strozier.<ref>Strozier, C.B., and Offer, D. (eds.). 1985. The Leader: Psychohistorical Essays. New York: Plenum Press.</ref> Together they organized a collection of essays, addressing the protean nature of political leadership, tracing the history of the psychological study of leadership from ancient formulations in the Bible to the most recent and progressive psychoanalytic works. A second revised edition was published in 2011.<ref>Strozier, C.B., Offer, D. and Abdyli, Oliger (eds.). 2011. The Leader: Psychological Essays. New York: Springer</ref>
