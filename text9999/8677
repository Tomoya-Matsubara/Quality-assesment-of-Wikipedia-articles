'''Shah Rukh Khan''' (born '''Shahrukh Khan''', 2 November 1965), also known as '''SRK''', is an Indian film actor, producer and television personality. Referred to in the media as "Baadshah of Bollywood", "King of Bollywood" or "King Khan", he has appeared in more than 80&nbsp;[[Bollywood]] films. Described by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' as perhaps "the world's biggest movie star",<ref name="LAT"/> Khan has a significant following in Asia and the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]] worldwide. He is one of the richest actors in the world, with an estimated net worth of {{US$|link=yes}}400<U+2013>600 million, and his work in Bollywood has earned him [[List of awards and nominations received by Shah Rukh Khan|numerous accolades]], including 14&nbsp;[[Filmfare Awards]].

Khan started his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s. He made his Bollywood debut in 1992 with ''[[Deewana (1992 film)|Deewana]]''. Early in his career, Khan was recognised for portraying villainous roles in the films ''[[Darr]]'' (1993), ''[[Baazigar]]'' (1993) and ''[[Anjaam]]'' (1994). He then rose to prominence after starring in a series of romantic films, including ''[[Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge]]'' (1995), ''[[Dil To Pagal Hai]]'' (1997), ''[[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]]'' (1998) and ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...]]'' (2001). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of an alcoholic in ''[[Devdas (2002 Hindi film)|Devdas]]'' (2002), a NASA scientist in ''[[Swades]]'' (2004), a hockey coach in ''[[Chak De! India]]'' (2007) and a man with [[Asperger syndrome]] in ''[[My Name Is Khan]]'' (2010). Many of his films display themes of Indian national identity and connections with diaspora communities, or gender, racial, social and religious differences and grievances. For his contributions to film, the Government of India honoured him with the [[Padma Shri]], and the Government of France awarded him both the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] and the [[Legion of Honour|L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur]].

As of 2015, Khan is co-chairman of the motion picture production company [[Red Chillies Entertainment]] and its subsidiaries, and is the co-owner of the [[Indian Premier League]] cricket team [[Kolkata Knight Riders]]. He is a frequent television presenter and stage show performer. The media often label him as "Brand SRK" because of his many endorsement and entrepreneurship ventures. Khan's philanthropic endeavours have provided health care and disaster relief, and he was honoured with [[UNESCO]]'s Pyramide con Marni award in 2011 for his support of children's education. He regularly features in listings of the most influential people in [[Indian culture]], and in 2008 ''[[Newsweek]]'' named him one of their fifty most powerful people in the world.
