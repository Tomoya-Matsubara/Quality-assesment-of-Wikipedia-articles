In July 1874, a select committee declared Montgomery's election to be "null and void", as he had a contract for the supply of [[Railroad tie|railway sleepers]] with the general government in breach of election rules. The select committee accepted that the breach was inadvertent.<ref name="1874 select committee ruling">{{Cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=TS18740731.2.8|title=House of Representatives|issue=1998|date=31 July 1874|newspaper=The Star|pages=2|accessdate=9 April 2010}}</ref> Montgomery stood for re-election in the second by-election, on 10 August 1874<ref name="Aug 1874 addressing electorate">{{Cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=TS18740808.2.13|title=MR MONTGOMEEY AT AKAROA|issue=2005|date=8 August 1874|newspaper=The Star|accessdate=9 April 2010}}</ref> and was returned unopposed.<ref name="Akaroa Aug 1874 results">{{Cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=TS18740810.2.9|title=LATEST TELEGRAMS|issue=2006|date=10 August 1874|newspaper=The Star|accessdate=9 April 2010}}</ref>
