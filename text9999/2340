The '''Grace Cooke House''', also known as the '''Harold St. John Residence''', at 2365 O{{okina}}ahu Avenue in [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu, Hawai{{okina}}i]], is significant both for its [[American Craftsman]] [[bungalow]] [[architecture]] and [[landscaping]] and for its most famous resident, [[Harold St. John]], a distinguished [[professor]] of [[botany]] at the [[University of Hawaii|University of Hawai{{okina}}i]]. The house and lot were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983, by which time St. John was living in a separate small cottage to the rear of the lot.<ref name="nris" />

The craftsmanship orientation of the period can also be seen in the landscaping, in particular the integration of the [[bluestone]] steps up to the front [[porch]], the [[lava rock]] foundation, and the natural rock [[outcrop]] on which the house sits. The spacious porch wraps around the right side of the house, balanced by a [[gable]]-roofed wing on the left. The rest of the house has a [[shingle]]d [[hip roof]]. Finely crafted exposed [[rafter]]s embellish both the hip and gable roofs, decorative shingle patterns adorn the exterior [[walls]], [[windows]], and porch columns, and a simple [[balustrade]] lines the porch.<ref name="nris" />

Two sets of double doors lead from the porch into the interior, with [[bedroom]]s and [[bath]] on the left and a large open living and dining area on the right, with paneled walls and [[coffered ceiling]]s. The [[kitchen]] is off the dining area to the right, and a [[basement]] originally served as a maid's quarters. The [[attic]] was partly finished and two dormers were added by St. John during the 1930s. The remainder of the house is unaltered.<ref name="nris" />

The lot also has some striking mature [[tree]]s in the front yard, including two [[Royal Poinciana]] ([[Delonix regia]]) beside the driveway, a West Indian [[mahogany]] ([[Swietenia mahagoni]]), and a huge [[Sandbox tree]] ([[Hura crepitans]])<ref name="nris" /> that has been designated an "exceptional tree" by the [[City and County of Honolulu]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.honolulu.gov/parks/exceptionaltree.htm |title=City and Couunty of Honolulu: Parks and Recreation: Exceptional Tree Program |accessdate=2010-01-11 }}</ref>
