[[Image:London Congestion Charge, Old Street, England.jpg|thumb|At [[Old Street]], street markings and a sign (inset) with the white-on-red C alert drivers to the charge. The sign displays the original operating hours for the scheme.]]{{Politics of London}}
The '''London congestion charge''' is a fee charged for some categories of motor vehicle to travel at certain times within the Congestion Charge Zone (CCZ), a traffic area in London. The charge aims to reduce congestion, and raise investment funds for London's transport system. The zone was introduced in [[central London]] on 17 February 2003, and extended into parts of west London on 19 February 2007. Though not the first scheme of its kind in the United Kingdom, it was the largest when introduced, and it remains one of the largest in the world. Several cities around the world have referenced London's [[congestion charge]] when considering their own schemes.

The standard charge is <U+00A3>10 for each day, for each non-exempt vehicle that travels within the zone between 07:00 and 18:00 (Monday-Friday only); a penalty of between <U+00A3>60 and <U+00A3>180 is levied for non-payment. On 4 January 2011 several changes were implemented based on the public consultation conducted in 2008, which included the removal of the Western Extension, a charge increase from <U+00A3>8 to <U+00A3>10, and the introduction of an automated payment system.<ref name=TfL2011/> [[Transport for London]] (TfL) administers the charge; [[Capita Group]] operated it under contract until 31 October 2009, and IBM took over on 1 November 2009. The system is mostly run on an automatic basis using [[automatic number plate recognition]].

== Coverage ==
=== Area covered by the charge ===
The boundary of the zone, as of 19 February 2007, starts at the northern end of Vauxhall Bridge and (travelling in a clockwise direction) heads along the northern bank of the [[River Thames]] as Grosvenor Road, the [[Chelsea Embankment]] and [[Cheyne Walk]]. From there, it heads north, along the eastern edges of the [[Kensington]] and [[Earl's Court]] one-way systems, part of the [[A3220 road|A3220]], with the roads in between charged, before continuing to the [[A40 road (Great Britain)|A40]] [[Westway (London)|Westway]] as the [[Holland Road (London)|Holland Road]] and the [[West Cross Route]]. The boundary then includes parts of [[North Kensington]], but the actual boundary is defined by the [[West London Line]] railway track, which runs between Latimer Road (inside the zone) and [[Wood Lane]] (outside the zone), until Scrubs Lane, before turning east, following the [[Great Western Main Line]] out of [[Paddington Station|Paddington]] towards [[Ladbroke Grove]]. Here, the boundary follows the [[Grand Union Canal]] and rejoins the existing zone at [[Edgware Road]] after skirting [[Paddington]], by way of the Bishop's Bridge Road, Eastbourne Terrace, [[Praed Street]] and Sussex Gardens.<ref name="guardianQA">{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theissues/article/0,,519534,00.html |title=Q&A: The congestion charge |coauthors=Simon Jeffery and Sarah Phillips |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=7 August 2006 |accessdate=26 May 2007 | location=London}}</ref> The Western Extension was officially removed from the charging zone beginning 4 January 2011, but charging on the Western extension effectively ended on 24 December 2010.<ref name=TfL2011/>

[[Transport for London|TfL]] has defined some free through routes, where drivers do not have to pay the charge. The main route is defined by the western boundary of the original zone [[Vauxhall Bridge Road]], [[Grosvenor Place]], [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]] and [[Edgware Road]], with some additions around [[Victoria, London|Victoria]]. The [[Westway (London)|Westway]] is the other exempt route.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2006/11/09/congestion_through_roads_feature.shtml |title=Congestion Charge Through Roads |date=22 February 2007  |publisher=BBC London |accessdate=26 May 2007}}</ref>

=== Original area covered ===
[[Image:London congestion charge zone.png|thumb|Until 18 February 2007 the congestion charge applied to drivers within the highlighted area. With some minor adaptions this map coincides with the current Congestion Charging zone after the removal of the Western Extension on 4 January 2011.]]
The original boundary of the zone (17 February 2003 <U+2013> 18 February 2007) was largely the [[London Inner Ring Road]]. Starting at the northernmost point and moving clockwise, the major roads defining the boundary were [[Pentonville Road]], [[City Road]], [[Old Street]], [[Commercial Street (London)|Commercial Street]], [[Mansell Street (London)|Mansell Street]], [[Tower Bridge Road]], [[New Kent Road]], [[Elephant and Castle]], [[Vauxhall Bridge Road]], [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]], [[Edgware Road]], [[Marylebone Road]] and [[Euston Road]] (other roads filled the small gaps between these roads). The zone therefore included the whole of the [[City of London]], the financial district, and the [[West End of London|West End]], London's primary commercial and entertainment centre.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/03/congestion_charge/exemptions_guide/html/what.stm |title=What it is |publisher=BBC News   |year=2003 |accessdate=26 May 2007}}</ref> There were 136,000 residents living within the zone (of a total population of around 7,000,000 in [[Greater London]]), though the zone was primarily thought of (and zoned) as commercial rather than residential. There was little heavy industry within the zone. Signs were erected and symbols painted on the road to help drivers recognise the congestion charge area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cclondon.com/signsandsymbol.shtml |title=Signs and Symbols |work=CCLondon.com |publisher=[[Transport for London]] |accessdate=27 May 2007}}</ref>

== Payment and concessions ==
=== Payment ===
While drivers of private vehicles can pay the daily charge either the day before, on the day or on the following day, whether they are seen to enter the zone or not, the same does not apply to fleets of business vehicles. Businesses with a minimum of ten or more vehicles can register with TfL, and will be charged <U+00A3>7 per vehicle per day for vehicles in the fleet detected by the cameras. In May 2005, businessman Miguel Camacho set up fivepounds.co.uk (referring to the then-current pricing), whose sole function was to sign up private drivers to their "fleet", thus offering the convenience of not having to pay the charge pro-actively, avoiding fines in the case of a forgotten journey and also potentially getting a "free journey" if undetected by the cameras. TfL, which obtains nearly half of its net revenue from fines{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}, moved quickly to quash the loophole, by demanding that fleet operators provide the [[vehicle register|registration document]] for each vehicle in their fleet. Fivepounds went out of business on 26 February 2006.<ref>{{Cite news |first=David |last=Williams  |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-18482241-details/TfL+changes+rules+to+stop+C-charge+%27fleet%27+scheme/article.do;jsessionid=kZk2HQcLn3zvTN1PT229XqYqhSJ5Y3syqRlLQfl2QlnXNLLxgcJp!-647369553!-1407319224!7001!-1 |title=TfL changes rules to stop C-charge 'fleet' scheme  |work=Evening Standard |publisher=Associated Newspapers Limited |date=9 May 2005 |accessdate=6 January 2008}}</ref>

Several changes went into effect beginning 4 January 2011, including the introduction of Congestion Charging Auto Pay (CC Auto Pay), which is an automated payment system that automatically records the number of charging days a vehicle travels within the charging zone each month and takes the charge from a registered debit or credit card on a monthly basis. Any user can nominate up to five vehicles for each CC Auto Pay account and drivers of these vehicles pay a reduced <U+00A3>9 daily charge. Those signing up to CC Auto Pay pay an annual <U+00A3>10 registration charge per vehicle. The congestion charge was increased to <U+00A3>10 if paid in advance or on the day of travel; to <U+00A3>12 if paid by midnight the charging day after travel; and to <U+00A3>9 if registered for Congestion Charging Auto Pay.<ref name=TfL2011/>

=== Exemptions and discounts ===
Some vehicles such as [[London buses|buses]], minibuses (over a certain size), [[Hackney carriage|taxis]], ambulances, fire engines and police vehicles, motorcycles, [[Peel P50|very small three-wheelers]], [[alternative fuel]] vehicles and bicycles are exempt from the charge, although some of the exemptions are 100% discounts that still require registration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2006/10/30/congestioncharge_feature.shtml |title=Congestion Charging in London |date=5 April 2007 |accessdate=26 May 2007  |publisher=BBC London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cclondon.com/exemptions.shtml |title=Exemptions & Discounts |work=CCLondon.com |publisher=[[Transport for London]]|accessdate=26 May 2007}}</ref>  Residents of the zone are eligible for a 90% discount if they pay the charge for a week or more at once, although there are administration charges <U+2013> presently a minimum of <U+00A3>10 <U+2013> for claiming the discount.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cclondon.com/secure/dynamicpages/discount/WF_PreRegIntroduction_W.aspx |title=Residents' Provisional Registration <U+2013> Introduction |work=CCLondon.com |publisher=[[Transport for London]] |accessdate=26 May 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070609211938/http://www.cclondon.com/secure/dynamicpages/discount/WF_PreRegIntroduction_W.aspx |archivedate = 9 June 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>  Some residents who live close to the West London extension are also entitled to the resident's discount.<ref name="bbcextfeature">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2006/10/30/westernextention_feature.shtml |title=The Western Extension  |publisher=BBC London |accessdate=23 November 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6368957.stm |publisher=BBC News   |date=19 February 2007 |title= Congestion Charge Zone increases |accessdate=23 November 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-15986644-details/Discounts+offer+in+%27buffer+zone%27+for+C-charge/article.do;jsessionid=hX0fHH1fjplDWh1zv1yybWKMKLMN262hQ1dJttlCW4b2myXW2GnG!713535882!-1407319226!7001!-1 |title=Discounts offer in 'buffer zone' for C-charge |first=Ross |last=Lydall |work=Evening Standard |publisher=Associated News |date=18 January 2005 |accessdate=23 November 2007}}</ref>

Drivers of foreign-registered vehicles are not exempt from the charge but the current lack of an international legal framework for the assessment and collection of traffic fines makes enforcement and recovery difficult. In 2005, ''[[The Guardian]]'' obtained documentation under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] which showed that out of 65,534 penalty tickets issued to non UK registered vehicles, only 1,993 had been paid.<ref name="guardian20050315">{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2005/mar/15/londonpolitics.freedomofinformation |title=TfL axes C-charge debt collection agency |work=The Guardian |date=15 March 2005 |accessdate=6 January 2008 |first=Andrew |last=Clakr |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited | location=London}}</ref>

In October 2005, it was reported that two London [[embassy|embassies]], those of the United States and Germany, were not paying the charge as they considered it to be a tax, which they are protected from paying under the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations|Vienna Convention]]. Some other embassies do pay the charge.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/4352520.stm  |title=Road toll leads to diplomatic row  |publisher=BBC News   |date=18 October 2005 |accessdate=8 April 2006}}</ref>  By May 2006, it was reported, the US embassy owed <U+00A3>270,000 in fines for non-payment.

TfL can and does suspend the congestion charge either in a small local area to cope with incidents and if directed to do so by a police officer.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tfl-cc.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/tfl_cc.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1652&p_created=1121859571&p_sid=mIBG4ACi&p_accessibility=0&p_redirect=&p_lva=&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9MiZwX3Byb2RzPSZwX2NhdHM9JnBfcHY9JnBfY3Y9JnBfcGFnZT0xJnBfc2VhcmNoX3RleHQ9ZGl2ZXJzaW9u&p_li=&p_topview=1 |title= Will I have to pay the Charge if I am diverted into the Zone? |publisher=[[Transport for London]] |accessdate=27 May 2007}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref>  The congestion charge was suspended on 7 and 8 July 2005 in response to the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|terrorist attacks on London Transport]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/work/feeds/afx/2005/07/07/afx2128894.html |title=London Bombs Roundup Four terrorist blasts kill at least 37 people Update |work=Forbes |author=AFX News Limited |accessdate=26 May 2007 |date=7 July 2005}}</ref> The congestion charge was also suspended on 2 February 2009, in response to an extreme weather event (heavy snow fall) in the London area.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7864553.stm |publisher=BBC News   |date=2 February 2009 |title=Heavy snow hits much of Britain |accessdate=2 February 2009}}</ref>

=== Penalties and avoidance ===
Failure to pay results in a fine of <U+00A3>120, reduced to <U+00A3>60 if paid within 14 days, but increases to <U+00A3>180 if unpaid after 28 days.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cclondon.com/Penalties-Enforcement.shtml |title=Penalties and Enforcement |work=CCLondon.com |publisher=[[Transport for London]] |accessdate=26 May 2007}}</ref>  Although avoidance has become more sophisticated, compliance with the scheme and terms of payment has improved over the last few years, as is evidenced by the income from penalties dropping by approximately a quarter between 2005 and 2007. However, even after charges were increased, enforcement charges still make up a significant proportion of the net revenues.<ref name=tfljune2005/><ref name=tfljune2007/>  Several newspapers have reported that copied [[British car number plates|number plates]] are being used to avoid the congestion charge, resulting in vehicle owners receiving penalty notices for failure to pay when their vehicles have not been inside the zone. TfL has stated it is keeping a database of these numbers and that they will trigger an alert.<ref name="bbc20040624">{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/3837349.stm |date=24 June 2004 |title=Car cloners try avoiding charges |publisher=BBC News   |accessdate=23 November 2007}}</ref><ref name="i20030326">{{Cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030226/ai_n12672682 |title=London congestion charge leads to flood of false number plates |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=26 February 2003 |first=Charles |last=Arthur |accessdate=23 November 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071210230753/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030226/ai_n12672682 |archivedate = 10 December 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref name="wsj20030226">{{Cite news |url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB119396467957679995-knn9B_El5rlJmyW5kOqDAjV6v_w_20071201.html?mod=tff_main_tff_top |title=London's Congestion Fee Begets Pinched Plates |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=26 February 2003 |first=Niraj |last=Sheth |accessdate=5 January 2008}}</ref>  The 2008 annual report on the operation of the scheme shows that around 26% of penalties go unpaid, because the notice is cancelled on appeal or the amount cannot be recovered, for example if the registered keeper of the vehicle cannot be traced, is deceased, or bankrupt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/sixth-annual-impacts-monitoring-report-2008-07.pdf|title=Central London Congestion Charging<U+2014>Impacts monitoring<U+2014>Sixth Annual Report, July 2008|publisher=Transport for London|month=July|year=2008|pages=215<U+2013>19|accessdate=7 August 2008|format=PDF}}</ref>

In 2007 a ''green motoring website'' alleged to TfL that owners of luxury cars were registering their vehicles as minicabs in order to qualify for exemption from the charge. Registering a vehicle as a minicab costs <U+00A3>82 plus <U+00A3>27 per year licence fee, much less than the congestion charge. TfL responded that it carried out regular checks to confirm that cars were being used for the purposes they were registered for, and that they had not discovered any such cases.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30100-1291533,00.html |work=sky.com |title=Minicab Scam To Avoid Congestion Charge |date=5 November 2007 |accessdate=21 November 2007 |publisher=British Sky Broadcasting}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref>

Entry authorisation and penalties cannot be issued to non-UK numberplates, and detection cameras may also be unable to read them, meaning that foreign plates are sometimes used to avoid the charge,{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} although cars with foreign plates may only be used in the UK for up to six months before being considered to have been officially imported and thenceforth required to have UK plates.

There was an instance, however, in which United States President [[Barack Obama]] was fined <U+00A3>120 by TfL for having [[Presidential state car (United States)|his limousine]], which bore plates for the [[Washington, DC|District of Columbia]], enter the zone without paying the toll<ref name=Sun072011>{{cite news|last=Wilson |first=Graeme |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3704469/Barack-Obama-motorcades-120-congestion-charge-fine.html |title="Obama motorcade<U+2019>s <U+00A3>120 congestion charge fine", 20 July 2011 |publisher=The Sun |date=2011-07-20 |accessdate=2011-09-03 |location=London}}</ref> during a visit to [[Buckingham Palace]] in May 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1389825/Obamas-Beast-Cadillac-flown-US-London-drive-Mall.html |title="The car that thinks it's a tank: Inside Obama's 'Beast' Cadillac that is being flown from the U.S. to drive down the Mall", 23 May 2011 |publisher=Daily Mail |date=2011-05-23 |accessdate=2011-09-03 |first1=Chris |last1=Greenwood |first2=Rebecca |last2=English}}</ref> The Mayor of London, [[Boris Johnson]], requested at the time of the visit that the <U+00A3>10 toll be paid.<ref name=Sun072011/> <U+00A3>50&nbsp;million in unpaid congestion charge fines and <U+00A3>491,000 in parking fines owed by foreign diplomatic staff has gone unpaid <U+2013> the US owing the most at <U+00A3>5&nbsp;million and [[Russia]] second at <U+00A3>4.4&nbsp;million.

== Operations and technology ==
Whilst TfL is responsible for the scheme, the operation is sub-contracted to a number of outside companies. Since 2009, IBM is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the charging system, whilst Siemens Traffic Solutions provides and operates the physical enforcement infrastructure. Originally, Capita Group maintained the system under a five-year contract worth around <U+00A3>230m.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2003/02/21/192717/capita-admits-congestion-charge-teething-problems.htm |title=Capita admits congestion charge 'teething problems' |first=James |last=Rogers |date=21 February 2003 |work=Computer Weekly |publisher=Reed Business Information}}</ref>  Having been threatened with the termination of the contract by [[Ken Livingstone]], then [[Mayor of London]], for poor performance, when the zone was subsequently extended, Capita was awarded an extension to the original contract up until February 2009 to cover the expanded zone.<ref name="guardian-capita">{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/congestion/story/0,12768,1389270,00.html |work=The Guardian |title=Capita congestion charge contract to be extended |first=Andrew |last=Clark |date=13 December 2005 |accessdate=21 November 2007 |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited | location=London}}</ref>  Capita has employed sub-contractors including [[Mastek]], based in [[Mumbai]], India, who are responsible for much of the Information Technology infrastructure. Due to the wide spread of sub-contractors around the world and because some data protection regulations vary from country to country, the scheme has prompted concerns about privacy from technology specialists.<ref>{{Cite news | first=John |last=Lettice |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/02/21/the_london_charge_zone/ |title=The London charge zone, the DP Act, and MS .NET |work=The Register |date=21 February 2003  |accessdate=8 April 2006}}</ref>  Transport for London have announced that from 2009 [[IBM]] will operate the charge, along with the [[London low emission zone|low emission zone]] under contract.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7062030.stm |title=Capita to lose congestion charge |date=25 October 2007 |accessdate=21 November 2007 |publisher=BBC News  }}</ref>

The scheme makes use of purpose-built [[automatic number plate recognition]] (ANPR) cameras, manufactured by PIPs Technology, to record vehicles entering and exiting the zone.

The cameras take two still pictures in colour and black and white and use [[infrared]] technology to identify the number plates. The camera network and other roadside equipment is managed largely automatically by an instation system developed by [[Roke manor research|Roke Manor Research Ltd]], which delivers number plates to the billing system. These identified numbers are checked against the list of payers overnight by computer. In those cases when a number plate has not been recognised then they are checked manually.<ref name="preparing" />  Those that have paid but have not been seen in the central zone are not refunded, and those that have not paid and are seen are fined. The registered keeper (The registered keeper is presumed to be the owner unless shown otherwise)of such a vehicle is looked up in a database provided by the [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]] (DVLA), based in [[Swansea]].<ref name="preparing" /><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/03/congestion_charge/exemptions_guide/html/works.stm |title=How it Works |accessdate=27 May 2007 |publisher=BBC News  }}</ref>

=== Road tolls ===
{{main|Toll road}}
[[Image:Cc-london-sign-out.jpg|thumb|right|Signs indicate the boundary of the congestion charge area.]]
Historically, private toll roads, funded by [[turnpike trust]]s, were common from the late 17th century until the [[Local Government Act 1888]] passed ownership and responsibility to [[county councils|county]] and [[county borough]] councils.<ref name="turnpiketime">{{cite web |url=http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/webmap/hantsmap/hantsmap/turnpike.htm |title=Timeline of British Turnpike Trusts |publisher=University of Portsmouth, Department of Geography |accessdate=18 November 2007}}</ref>
As a result the use of roads in the United Kingdom is generally free of charge, subject to the payment of [[Vehicle excise duty|Vehicle Excise Duty (VED)]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/OwningAVehicle/HowToTaxYourVehicle/DG_10021514 |title=Car tax rules |work=Directgov |accessdate=18 November 2007}}</ref> However, there are specific sections of public roads that remained tolled, which are mainly [[List of toll bridges#United Kingdom|bridges]] and [[Toll tunnel|tunnels]] as well as the [[M6 toll]] motorway.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6382211.stm |title=Q&A: Road pricing |date=21 February 2007 |publisher=BBC News   |accessdate=23 November 2007}}</ref> Of the many previously existing toll roads in London<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.georgianindex.net/ldn_tollgates/Toll_gate.html|title=Tollgates of London|accessdate=23 November 2007}}</ref> there remains one, College Road in [[Dulwich]], which is privately owned by [[Dulwich College]] but accessible by the public.<ref>{{Cite hansard | url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199495/cmhansrd/1994-12-19/Writtens-1.html | house=House of Commons | date=19 December 2004 | column=875 }}</ref>

Road tolls have been advocated by many others in the past, such as the 18th century economist [[Adam Smith]], as a way of directly funding the construction and maintenance of routes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://policyinstitute.info/news-events/should-darling-travel-down-smiths-road-pricing-route/ |publisher=The Policy Institute |title=Should Darling travel down Smith's road pricing route? |first=Tom |last=Miers |date=7 July 2003 |accessdate=27 May 2007}}</ref>

The [[Her Majesty's Government|government]]'s [[Smeed Report]] of 1964 was the first full assessment of the practicality of road pricing in a British city on the basis of congestion.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/transport/Story/0,2763,1503017,00.html |title=Q&A: National road charging scheme |first=Matthew |last=Tempest |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=7 August 2006 |accessdate=26 May 2007 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Smeed, |first=R.J. |year=1964 |title=Road pricing: the economic and technical possibilities |publisher=HMSO}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Experts' plan to cut traffic pressure |work=The Times |date=11 June 1964 |accessdate=23 November 2007}}</ref> It recommended a method of "car user restraint" by a variable system of [[Road pricing|charging]] for road usage <U+2013> if the government had the will to do so. During the early years of the [[Greater London Council]] the first plans were drawn up for a system of cordon charging or supplementary licensing for use in the central area. A formal study was undertaken into the merits of the scheme, and in 1973 concluded that it would improve traffic and environmental conditions in the centre.<ref name=bannister>{{Cite book | title = Transport Planning | last = Bannister | first =  David | year=2002 }}</ref> However, the newly elected [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] council rejected the study's findings in favour of greater investment in public transport.

== Effects ==
The effects of the congestion charge have been controversial. Studies have been made of its effects on congestion, traffic levels, road safety, the use of public transport, the environment, and business activity matters. A report published by TfL in October 2004 stated that only seven of the 13 government aims for London transport would be met by 2010. The target on reducing congestion for [[Greater London]] overall will not be met, the report said.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/3958931.stm | title=Road toll 'fails to cut traffic' |publisher=BBC News   |date=27 October 2004 |accessdate=8 April 2006}}</ref>

=== Immediate impact ===
On the first day 190,000 vehicles moved into or within the zone during charging hours, a decrease of around 25% on normal traffic levels, partly due to it also being the half-term school holiday.<ref name="bbc20030218" />  A report from the [[Bow Group]] stated that historically, London congestion is at its worst during the morning rush hour, and that the early days of congestion charging had little impact on that critical time, the main effect occurring after 11&nbsp;am.<ref name="bow">{{Cite journal |title=London Under Livingstone: An evaluation of Labour<U+2019>s Mayor |author=Christopher Mahon, Alastair Sloan |publisher=[[Bow Group|The Bow Group]] | url = http://www.bowgroup.org/harriercollectionitems/LondonUnderLivingstoneFINALv2.pdf |format=PDF}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref>  Just over 100,000 motorists paid the charge personally, 15<U+2013>20,000 were fleet vehicles paying under fleet arrangements, and it was believed around 10,000 liable motorists did not pay the due charge.<ref name="bbc20030218">{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2776915.stm |title=10,000 chased for congestion fine |date=18 February 2003 |publisher=BBC News   |accessdate=26 May 2007}}</ref>

Initial suggestions that school holidays were responsible for part of the traffic drop during the first week of operation of the charge were confirmed when traffic rose again by 5% following the return to school at the beginning of the second week of the charge. Reports indicated that, over the first month or so of operation, traffic was consistently down at least 15% on pre-charge levels, with the second week seeing the reduction drop to 20%.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2809073.stm |title=Congestion charge survives school run |publisher=BBC News   |date=23 February 2003 |accessdate=26 May 2007}}</ref>
The [[AA Motoring Trust]] suggested that changes to the timing of traffic lights and the end of major [[road works]] had also impacted congestion.<ref name="bbc60603">{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2967852.stm |title=Congestion charge cuts jams |date=6 June 2003 |accessdate=23 November 2007 |publisher=BBC News  }}</ref>

On 23 October 2003 TfL published a report reviewing the first six months of the charge. The report's main findings were that the average number of cars and delivery vehicles entering the central zone was 60,000 fewer than the previous year. Around 50<U+2013>60% of this reduction was attributed to transfers to public transport, 20<U+2013>30% to journeys avoiding the zone, 15<U+2013>25% switching to car share, and the remainder to reduced number of journeys, more travelling outside the hours of operation, and increased use of motorbikes and bicycles. Journey times were found to have been reduced by 14%. Variation in journey time for a particular route repeated on many occasions also decreased. The report also claimed that although the charge was responsible for about 4,000 fewer people visiting the zone daily, that the charge was responsible for only a small fraction of the 7% drop in retail sales reported.<ref name="tfl6months">{{Cite book |title=Congestion charging six months on |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/downloads/pdf/congestion-charging/cc-6monthson.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060515194436/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/downloads/pdf/congestion-charging/cc-6monthson.pdf |archivedate=15 May 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=8 April 2006 |publisher=[[Transport for London]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2004/02/17/cncong17.xml |work=Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph |title= Charge fails to stop roar of London traffic |first=Caroline |last=Muspratt |date=16 February 2004 |accessdate=27 May 2007}}</ref>

By comparison, an experimental short-term congestion charge in [[Stockholm]] saw an average 25% reduction in traffic numbers.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/politics_show/6424481.stm |title=Traffic solutions |work=The Politics Show |publisher=BBC News   |date=9 March 2007 |accessdate=6 May 2007 |first=Michelle |last=Mayman}}</ref>

A year before the congestion zone, TfL set up automatic traffic counters and augmented them with regular classified traffic counts at key locations, in order to monitor long term trends.<ref name="tfljune2007">{{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/fifth-annual-impacts-monitoring-report-2007-07-07.pdf |format=PDF |title=Impacts Monitoring <U+2013> Fifth Annual Report |publisher=[[Transport for London]] |month=June | year=2007 |accessdate=23 November 2007}}</ref>  Their results are reviewed and reported annually.

A report by TfL in early 2007 indicated that there were 2.27 traffic delays per kilometre in the original charging zone. This compared with a figure of 2.3 before the introduction of the congestion charge. After the scheme was introduced they had measured an improvement in journey times of 0.7 minutes per km, or 30%. This improvement had decreased to 22% in 2006, and during 2006 congestion levels had increased so that the improvement, compared to the year before the scheme, was just 7%. TfL explained this as a result of changes to road priorities within the zone, delays caused by new pedestrian and road user safety schemes, and, most particularly, a doubling of road works in the latter half of 2006.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7109727.stm |title=Congestion charge 'not working' |date=23 February 2007 |publisher=BBC News   |accessdate=23 November 2007}}</ref>
(Utilities were encouraged to complete planned road works in the year proceeding the congestion charge, so it would appear that the first year of measurement used for later comparisons would also have been affected by streetworks to some extent.)<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/02/16/ncong16.xml&sSheet=/news/2004/02/16/ixhome.html |title=London congestion charge 'not working' |first=Paul |last=Marston |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph News and Media Limited |date=6 February 2004 |accessdate=24 November 2007}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref><ref name="bbc20070711">{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6292930.stm |date=11 July 2007 |title=Road toll 'cut traffic by 70,000' |publisher=BBC News   |accessdate=24 November 2007}}</ref>

TfL's report in June 2007 found that the level of traffic of all vehicle types entering the central Congestion Charge Zone was now consistently 16% lower in 2006 than the pre-charge levels in 2002.<ref name="tfljune2007" />  The conservative [[Bow Group]] noted that the main effect occurred after 11&nbsp;am.<ref name="bow"/><!-- The Bow Group report commented on Fig 2.2 from the TFL report (page22). Would be nice to have that graph here. -->

Breaking down that figure showed the number of chargeable vehicles entering the zone had reduced by 30% (primarily cars and minicabs, although vans and lorries had decreased by 13%), while there were overall increases in the numbers of taxis, buses, and especially bicycles. The daily profile of traffic flows had changed, with less traffic after 9:30&nbsp;am and a peak immediately before and after the end of the charging period. The level of traffic entering the zone during the morning peak had not reduced as much as at other times.<ref name="tfljune2007" />
They had noted a small but pervasive long term trend of less traffic entering the zone, expected to be a result of people changing their location and lifestyle, perhaps influenced by the charge.
Once within the charging zone car and delivery traffic remained unchanged, suggesting that the journeys made by residents and businesses within the zone were broadly unaffected. Changes to the road network over the years has made direct comparisons difficult, but TfL suspect that certain routes used heavily by taxis and buses within the zone have seen substantially increased traffic.
On some of the boundary roads traffic numbers had increased slightly but congestion and delays were largely unchanged from 2002 levels.
Year on year, counts of inbound traffic approaching the zone had also seen a distinct and significant 5<U+2013>7% decline in the number of chargeable vehicles, which was unexplained.<ref name="tfljune2007" />

The charge operates for under one third of the hours in a year and covers around two thirds of the central London traffic.<ref name="tfljune2007" />  In total 8% of traffic kilometres are affected by the scheme.<ref name="tfljune2007" /> TfL have extrapolated the trends in road speed in the congestion zone; they have suggested that speeds would have dropped from 17&nbsp;km/h in 2003 to 11.5&nbsp;km/h by 2006, had the scheme not been put in place.<ref name="tfljune2007" />

Following the introduction of the Western Extension, TfL stated that traffic had fallen around 10 to 15% in the extended zone.<ref name="bbc20070521">{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6676671.stm |title=Traders rally against charge zone |date=21 May 2007 |publisher=BBC News   |accessdate=23 May 2007}}</ref>  The original zone is showing a 4% increase in congestion following expansion of the congestion charge and the introduction of extended to discounts to residents of the new zone and buffer zone.<ref name="bbc20070711" />
TfL assessed the increase in charges in 2005 to have had only a slight impact overall.<ref name="tfljune2007" />

Although it was suggested that the scheme should improve the speed of vehicles in the centre, the [[London Ambulance Service]] (LAS) anticipated increased volumes of traffic around the edge of the zone and an increase in demand within the zone, that might both adversely affect clinical outcomes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/publications/areport/LAS%20Annual%20Report%202001_02.pdf |title=Annual Report 2002-3 |format=PDF |publisher=London Ambulance Service |accessdate=22 January 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080228180759/http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/publications/areport/LAS%20Annual%20Report%202001_02.pdf |archivedate = 28 February 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>
However, since then, survival rates for LAS' witnessed cardiac arrests have tripled across Greater London. LAS attributes these improvements to equipment availability and operational processes, such as the deployment of four-wheeled and two-wheeled rapid response units that can weave through congestion more quickly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/news/archive/pressreleases/pressreleases_2007/oct24_07.htm |title= Capital<U+2019>s cardiac arrest survival rate more than trebles in five years |publisher=London Ambulance Service |date=24 October 2007 |accessdate=22 January 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080622225853/http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/news/archive/pressreleases/pressreleases_2007/oct24_07.htm |archivedate = 22 June 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>
This, and TfL's increase in the number central London traffic calming measures, would suggest that other much more significant factors have masked any congestion charge-related changes in outcome, either up or down. In addition, like some other essential services, LAS felt it necessary to divert about <U+00A3><U+00BC>M from their budget to pay congestion charge allowances for key staff affected by the charges during their journey to work.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/ABOUTUS/trustboard/media/Trust%20Board%2030Sep03.pdf |title= Meeting of the Trust Board |publisher=London Ambulance Service NHS Trust |page=Table 18 |date=30 September 2003 |accessdate=22 January 2008|format=PDF |nopp=true|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080228180812/http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/ABOUTUS/trustboard/media/Trust%20Board%2030Sep03.pdf |archivedate = 28 February 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

According to a November 2007 newspaper report, TfL data showed that after an initial improvement, that rush-hour congestion had become worse than it was before the congestion charge was introduced.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Rush-hour is slower than before C-charge |first=Pippa |last=Crerar |date=6 November 2007 |work=The Evening Standard |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23419705-details/Rush-hour+is+slower+than+before+C-charge/article.do |accessdate=27 January 2008}}</ref>  In December 2007, another article contained a similar observation, that although after the first year the results were looking good, with traffic speeds up, that at the time of writing, traffic speeds and delays were virtually back to their February 2003 levels.<ref name="st20071209"/>

=== Road safety ===
TfL have estimated that the charge appeared to have had a small impact on the number of road traffic accidents <U+2013> but this was much less than the national and London trend towards fewer accidents. There were 2,598 personal injury road traffic accidents inside the zone in the year before the scheme. This fell by about 200 each year to 1,629 in 2005. TfL's statisticians have extrapolated an estimate that between 40 and 70 injuries have been avoided annually because of the charging zone, with most of the rest attributed to the changes that altered and slowed down the road network "in favour of the people-moving capacity of the network."<ref name="tfljune2006">{{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/FourthAnnualReportFinal.pdf |title=Impacts monitoring <U+2013> Fourth Annual Report |format=PDF |publisher=[[Transport for London]] |accessdate=11 February 2008 |month=June | year=2006}}</ref>

TfL expects that many of these road safety interventions would have occurred irrespective of the introduction of congestion charging. Cars and motorcycles have seen the biggest reduction in accidents, whereas bicyclists have seen a slight increase, which perhaps reflects their increased numbers. For comparison, the inner ring road also saw a substantial drop as accidents fell from 961 to 632, which was slightly less than the average for Greater London.<ref name="tfljune2007" />

=== Number plate cloning ===
Another effect of the scheme, which relies on the recognition of vehicle [[British car number plates|number plates]] to enforce the charge, is that it has led to an increase in the number of cars carrying false number plates.<ref name="i20030326"/><ref name="wsj20030226"/>  Fines for non-payment of the charge are sent to the [[Vehicle register|registered keeper]] of the number plate, without first checking whether the vehicle to which the plate belongs was actually the offending vehicle, the [[Legal burden of proof|onus]] being placed on the keeper to prove their innocence.<ref>{{Cite news

=== Public transport ===
On the launch date of the original zone, an extra 300 buses (out of a total of around 8,000) were introduced.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2774271.stm |title=First congestion fines to go out |publisher=BBC News   |date=18 February 2003 |accessdate=26 May 2007}}</ref>
Bus and [[London Underground]] managers reported that buses and tubes were little, if at all, busier than normal.<ref name="bbc20030218" />  Usage of the Underground has increased by 1% above pre-charge levels, having fallen substantially in 2003/2004, whilst bus patronage in the [[central London]] area (not the same as the Congestion Charge Zone) had stabilised at 116,000 journeys per day after increasing from under 90,000 pre-charge. No change in [[National Rail]] patronage had been noted as a result of the introduction of the central zone charge.<ref name="tfljune2007" />

Since the introduction of the western extension, TfL has made a number of bus route changes to take advantage of the presumed higher traffic speeds and the greater demand for public transport. One new route ([[London Buses route 452|route 452]]) has been introduced and three others (routes [[London Buses route 31|31]], [[London Buses route 46|46]] and [[London Buses route 430|430]]) have been extended. In addition, the frequency of buses on other routes through the zone extension has been increased.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2007/02/19/congestion_bus_routes_feature.shtml  |publisher=BBC London |accessdate=26 May 2007 |title=Buses increased after congestion extension}}</ref>

=== Business ===
The effect of the congestion charge zone on local businesses is a contested issue. The TfL estimates that the effect on business has been overall neutral.<ref name="bbc20070521" />
 However the effect on business differs significantly by between stores. Some shops and businesses are reported to be heavily affected by the charge, both in terms of lost sales due to reduced traffic and increased delivery costs, as recognised by the London Chamber of Commerce.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2004/04/22/cncong22.xml |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Ltd |work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK |title=Congestion charge cost <U+00A3>300m, say Oxford St traders |first=Caroline |last=Muspratt |date=21 April 2004 |accessdate=26 May 2007 }}</ref> [[Image:Broadgate aerial 1.jpg|thumb|left|tower|upright|The [[City of London]] is covered by the congestion charge.]] In August 2003, the [[John Lewis Partnership]], a large department store, announced that in the first six months of the charge's operation, sales at their [[Oxford Street]] store fell by 7.3% whilst sales at other stores in the Greater London area but outside the Congestion Charge Zone rose by 1.7%.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2003/sep/05/londonpolitics.greaterlondonauthority |accessdate=5 January 2008 |title=Store chief hits at congestion charge |first=Rebecca |last=Allison |date=5 September 2003 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media | location=London}}</ref> To partly compensate for the loss of revenue they extended opening hours and introduced regular [[Sunday shopping|Sunday opening]] for the first time.<ref>{{cite web| title = Damaging rise in congestion charge not justified, says West End store| first = Roger | last = Blitz | date = 5 July 2005 | url=http://search.ft.com/nonFtArticle?id=050705000870 | work=Financial Times |accessdate=25 December 2007}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref>

However London First's own report indicated that business was broadly supportive.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Jury out on congestion charging |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3491453.stm |date=16 February 2004 |publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=28 May 2007}}</ref> Subsequently another report stated that there had been a reduction in some employment in the charging zone.<ref name="layoffs">{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2003/nov/25/transportintheuk.greaterlondonauthority |title=C-charge 'leads to layoffs' |first=Andrew |last=Clark |date=25 November 2003 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |accessdate=6 January 2008 | location=London}}</ref> TfL criticised the reports as unrepresentative and that its own statistics reported no effect on business.<ref name="layoffs" />

A report in May 2005 stated that the number of shoppers had declined by 7% year-on-year in March, 8% in April and 11% in the first two weeks of May. TfL countered that an [[economic downturn]], the [[Progress of the SARS outbreak|SARS outbreak]] and threat of terrorism were likely factors. At the same time a [[London Chamber of Commerce]] report indicated that 25% of businesses were planning on relocation following the charges introduction.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-5007517-details/Congestion+charge+hammers+shops/article.do |title=Congestion charge hammers shops |first=Richard |last=Allen |work=Evening Standard |publisher=Associated Newspapers |date=27 May 2003 |accessdate=26 May 2007}}</ref>  However an independent report six months after the charge was implemented suggested that businesses were then supporting the charge. London First commissioned the study which reported that 49% of businesses felt the scheme was working and only 16% that it was failing.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2003/aug/18/londonpolitics.greaterlondonauthority |title=Business backs congestion charge |date=13 August 2003 |first=Andrew |last=Clark |accessdate=26 May 2007 |publisher=Guardian News and Media |work=The Guardian | location=London}}</ref>  The Fourth Annual Review by TfL in 2004 indicated that business activity within the charge zone had been higher in both [[productivity]] and [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]] and that the charge had a "broadly neutral impact" on the London wide economy.<ref name="tfljune2006" /> The Fifth Annual Review continued to show the central congestion zone outperforming the wider London economy.<ref name="tfljune2007" />

The Centre for Economics and Business Research predicted that the West London extension in February 2007 would cause 6,000 job losses.<ref>{{Cite news |title= Congestion charge: Green lobby hails road-toll extension |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/congestion-charge-green-lobby-hails-roadtoll-extension-437070.html |first=Barrie |last=Clement |date=20 February 2007 |accessdate=26 May 2004 |work=The Independent |publisher=Independent News and Media Ltd | location=London}}</ref> In May 2007, a survey of 150 local businesses stated they had seen an average drop in business of 25% following the introduction of the charge, which was disputed by TfL which stated that there had been "no overall effect" on business and that it had outperformed the rest of the UK in the central zone during 2006.<ref name="bbc20070521" />

National trends had already shown a rapid decline of some other emissions during the late 1990s, notably [[carbon monoxide]], and levels have been relatively stable since 2002 across London. Since 2002, the [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO<sub>2</sub>) produced by diesel exhaust has become a serious problem, with the [[London Air Quality Network]] of [[King's College London]] reporting that the annual mean NO<sub>2</sub> objective (of 40 <U+03BC>gm-3 or 21 ppb) was exceeded at all kerbside and roadside monitoring sites across central and greater London during 12 months between 2005 and 2006. Although no areas within the Congestion Charge Zone reported NO<sub>2</sub> levels above an upper limit of 200 <U+03BC>gm-3 (105 ppb), some monitoring areas near the zone boundary experienced very long periods at such levels, notably the [[A23 road|A23]] near Brixton (3741 hours) and the [[Marylebone Road]] (849 hours).<ref name=laqn>{{cite web |format=PDF |url=http://www.londonair.org.uk/london/reports/AirQualityInLondon2005andmid2006.pdf |title=Air Quality In London 2005 and mid 2006 <U+2013> Briefing |last=Fuller & Green |date=28 July 2006 |publisher=London Air Quality Network |accessdate=8 January 2008}}</ref>  TfL report that emissions may not necessarily feed through into improvements in air quality and that vehicle emissions are only one contributor to total emissions of a particular pollutant along with weather conditions and industrial use.<ref name="tfljune2007" />  It was also reported that pollutant concentrations were being affected by the change in the make up of the vehicle fleet.<ref name="tfljune2007" />  Preliminary reports also indicate the rate of decline in certain pollutants is decreasing.<ref name="tfljune2007" />

A 2011 independent study published by the [[Health Effects Institute]] (HEI), and led by a researcher from [[King<U+2019>s College London]], found that there is little evidence the congestion charge scheme has improved air quality. This research used modelling and also compared actual air pollutant measurements within the congestion charge zone with those of control sites located in Outer London. The investigators concluded that "''it is difficult to identify significant air quality improvements from a specific program<U+2014>especially one targeted at a small area within a large city<U+2014>against the backdrop of broader regional pollutant and weather changes''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/04/hei-study-finds-london-congestion-charging-scheme-shows-little-evidence-of-improving-air-quality.html#tp|title=HEI study finds London Congestion Charging Scheme shows little evidence of improving air quality|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=27 April 2011|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref>

=== Outer London ===
The charge has proved controversial in the outer areas of London, where it has encouraged commuters who previously drove into central London to instead park at suburban railway or underground stations. This has been accompanied by the introduction of extra on-street parking restrictions and controlled parking zones in these areas, which affects local residents.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2003/mar/17/transportintheuk.greaterlondonauthority |title=Road and rail promises leave commuters unmoved |first=Andrew |last=Clark |date=17 March 2003 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |accessdate=6 January 2008 | location=London}}</ref>

== Income and costs ==

TfL's annual report for 2006<U+2013>7 shows that revenues from the congestion charge were <U+00A3>252.4m over the financial year, representing 8.5% of TfL's annual revenues. More than half of this was spent on the cost of running the toll system, at <U+00A3>130.1&nbsp;million. Once other charges were deducted, the congestion charge brought in an annual operating [[net income]] of <U+00A3>89.1m for TfL.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/corporate/annual-report-and-statement-of-accounts-06-07.pdf |format=PDF |title=Annual Report and Statement of Accounts 2006/07
 |month=April | year=2007 |author=[[Transport for London]] |publisher=[[Mayor of London]] |page=Note 26 |accessdate=25 November 2007}}</ref>
(This income compares with TfL's total revenue from bus and tube fares of <U+00A3>2,269.4m, or 76.6% of revenue before costs, or grants from central government of <U+00A3>2,390.3&nbsp;million.)

By law, all surpluses raised must be reinvested into London's transport infrastructure; at the start of the scheme it was anticipated that this would be around <U+00A3>200&nbsp;million.<ref name="bbcannounce" /><ref name="bbcrev">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2006/11/21/congestion_update_feature.shtml |title=Where has the money gone?  |publisher=BBC London |date=19 February 2007 |accessdate=26 May 2007}}</ref>  According to a report issued in February 2007, the initial costs of setting up the scheme were <U+00A3>161.7&nbsp;million,<ref name="bbcrev" />  with an annual operating cost of about <U+00A3>115m anticipated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbi.org.uk/ndbs/Regions.nsf/802737AED3E3420580256706005390AE/E98F7054FD93A6CF80256CCA005B7F58 |publisher=Confederation of British Industry |title=Congestion charging |accessdate=20 August 2006}}</ref>
Total revenues over the first three and a half years had been <U+00A3>677.4&nbsp;million, with TfL reporting a surplus over operating costs of <U+00A3>189.7&nbsp;million.<ref name="bbcrev" />

The initial operating revenues from the congestion charge did not reach the levels that were originally expected. Within six months of the start of the scheme, the reduction in traffic had been such that TfL were predicting a <U+00A3>65&nbsp;million revenue shortfall.<ref name="bbc20030612">{{Cite news |title=Congestion charge leads to budget shortfall |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/2985554.stm |publisher=BBC News   |date=12 June 2003 |accessdate=6 January 2008}}</ref>

The June 2005 increase in charges by 60% only resulted in a relatively small rise in revenues, as there were fewer penalty payments.
The anticipated start up costs of the Western extension were <U+00A3>125&nbsp;million with operating costs of <U+00A3>33m; expected [[gross revenue]]s were expected to be <U+00A3>80&nbsp;million resulting in [[net revenue]]s of <U+00A3>50&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/corporate/wez_EconomicIA.pdf  |format=PDF |title=Congestion Charging: Proposed Western Extension Public Consultation Economic and Business Impact Assessment |month=April | year=2005 |author=[[Transport for London]] with GLA Economics |publisher=[[Transport for London]] |pages=9, 10 |accessdate=26 May 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070630150201/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/corporate/wez_EconomicIA.pdf |archivedate = 30 June 2007}}</ref>

Although Parliament has limited the amount that authorities can borrow, for some time it had been speculated that the regular income obtained from the congestion charge and other revenues could be used to [[Securitization|securitise]] a [[bond issue]] that finances other transport projects across London.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200004100065  | title = Rocky road to a smoother journey | work=New Statesman | first = Stephen  | last = Glaister | date = 10 April 2000 | accessdate=25 December 2007}}</ref> TfL issued their first bond for <U+00A3>200&nbsp;million in 2005, to be repaid at 5% interest over 30 years.

== Political reaction ==

Before the charge's introduction, there were fears of a very chaotic few days as the charge bedded down. Indeed [[Ken Livingstone]], then [[Mayor of London]] and key proponent of the charge, himself predicted a "difficult few days"<ref name="indfirst">{{Cite news |first=Matthew |last=Beard |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/livingstone-predicts-difficult-few-days-as-congestion-charge-begins-597903.html |title=Livingstone predicts 'difficult few days' as congestion charge begins |work=The Independent |publisher=Independent News and Media Limited |date=17 February 2003  |accessdate=9 April 2006 | location=London}}</ref> and a "bloody day".<ref name="bbcfirstday">{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2772583.stm |title=Congestion charge cuts traffic levels |publisher=BBC News   |date=18 February 2003 |accessdate=26 May 2007}}</ref>

In July 2002, [[Westminster City Council]] launched a legal challenge against the plans, arguing that they would increase pollution and were a breach of human rights of residents on the boundary of the zone.<ref name="bbc20020715">{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2128482.stm |title=Congestion charges face legal challenge |publisher=BBC News   |date=15 July 2002 |accessdate=26 May 2007}}</ref>  The [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] rejected the claim.<ref name="scotsman20020801">{{Cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/roadtolls/Livingstone-wins-road-toll-battle.2348398.jp |title=Livingstone wins road toll battle |first=Alison |last=Hardie |work=The Scotsman |publisher=Johnston Press plc |date=1 August 2002 |accessdate=6 January 2008 |location=Edinburgh}}</ref>  On introduction, the scheme was the largest ever undertaken by a capital city.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2770721.stm |title=Smooth start for congestion charge |publisher=BBC News   |date=18 February 2003 |accessdate=26 May 2007}}</ref>

[[Steven Norris]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] candidate for mayor in 2004, has been a fierce critic of the charge, branding it the 'Kengestion' charge. A few days before the scheme came into operation, he wrote in a BBC report that it had been "shambolically organised", that the public transport network had insufficient spare capacity to cater for travellers deterred from using their cars in the area by the charge. Further, he said that the scheme would affect poorer sections of society more than the rich, with the daily charge being the same for all, regardless of vehicle size.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2752211.stm |first=Steve |last=Norris |title=Why Ken's charge will do damage for years to come |publisher=BBC News   |date=12 February 2003 |accessdate=27 May 2007

He pledged to scrap it if he became mayor in June 2004. He had also pledged that, if elected, he would grant an amnesty to anyone with an outstanding fine for non-payment of the charge on 11 June 2004. In an interview with London's ''[[Evening Standard]]'' newspaper on 5 February 2004, Conservative leader [[Michael Howard]] backed his candidate's view by saying that the charge "has undoubtedly had a damaging effect on business in London."<ref>{{Cite news |first=Joe |last=Murphy  |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-8990408-details/Howard%3A+C-charge+damages+business/article.do;jsessionid=MZ2vHQbCLrTT51KtYnyFvq8t5xJwyklhx1Q1clQ1LLJnNSy8VHqs!1365716654!-1407319225!7001!-1  |title=Howard: C-charge damages business |work=Evening Standard |publisher=Associated Newspapers Limited  |date=5 February 2004 |accessdate=6 January 2007}}</ref> [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] candidate, [[Simon Hughes]], however, supported the basic principles of the scheme.

In 2005, the [[Liberal Democrats]] claimed that Capita had been fined <U+00A3>4.5&nbsp;million for missing the targets set for the congestion charge, that was equivalent to <U+00A3>7,400 for every day that the charge had existed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Capita fined <U+00A3>4.5&nbsp;million for missing C-Charge targets |date=8 March 2005 |publisher=Liberal Democrats |url=http://www.glalibdems.org.uk/news/000263/capita_fined_45million_for_missing_ccharge_targets.html}}</ref>  The ''London Assembly Budget Committee'' 2003 report on the company criticised the contract with Capita as not providing value for money.<ref>{{Cite journal

The congestion charge remained an issue during the run up to the [[London mayoral election, 2008|2008 mayoral election]]. [[Boris Johnson]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] candidate suggested looking at a graduated charging scheme and proposed further consultation on whether to remove parts of the Congestion Charge Scheme. He also said that he would not introduce the emissions based charging system which was due to be introduced in October 2008<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23421570-details/Boris+backs+small+shops+campaign/article.do |publisher=Associated Newspapers Limited |work=Evening Standard |title=Boris backs small shops campaign |first=Pippa |last=Crerar |date=16 November 2007 |accessdate=23 November 2007}}</ref>

[[Brian Paddick]], the [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] candidate, suggested exempting [[Delivery (commerce)|delivery]] vehicles from the charge.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/11/17/npaddick117.xml&page=1 |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |title=Brian Paddick: 'Why I want to be mayor' |authors=Rachel Sylvester and Alice Thomson |date=18 November 2007 |accessdate=23 November 2007 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/11/13/nlibdem113.xml |title=Brian Paddick is Lib Dem London candidate |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |first=Brendan |last=Carlin |date=14 November 2007 |accessdate=23 November 2007}}</ref>

The successful mayoral candidate [[Boris Johnson]] announced<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7494495.stm| title=Mayor quashes <U+00A3>25 C-charge hike |publisher=BBC News  |date=8 July 2008|accessdate=8 July 2008}}</ref> on 8 July 2008 that his predecessor [[Ken Livingstone]]'s plan to introduce a <U+00A3>25 charge for the heavy-polluting vehicles will not go ahead.

== Further proposals ==
After the introduction of the charge, there were a number of suggestions for its future. Soon after charging commenced, Livingstone announced that he would carry out a formal review of the charge's success or failure six months after its introduction <U+2013> brought forward from one year, following the smooth start. On 25 February 2003 Livingstone stated, "I can't conceive of any circumstances in the foreseeable future where we would want to change the charge, although perhaps ten years down the line it may be necessary" referring to the amount that drivers have to pay, indicating that <U+00A3>5 was sufficient to bring about the reduction in traffic that he had hoped for.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2797177.stm |title='No increase' in congestion charge |publisher=BBC News   |date=25 February 2003 |accessdate=8 April 2006}}</ref> By November 2004, Livingstone directly contradicted his earlier stance and said in an interview with BBC London, "I have always said that during this term [his second term in office] it will go up to at least <U+00A3>6."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/3973157.stm |title=Road toll up by 'at least <U+00A3>1' |publisher=BBC News   |date=1 November 2004 |accessdate=8 April 2006}}</ref> By the end of the month, Livingstone changed his position again, saying in an announcement that, in fact, the rise would be to <U+00A3>8 for private vehicles and <U+00A3>7 for commercial traffic.

=== Western extension ===
[[Image:Park Lane Road sign.jpg|thumb|right|[[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]] is one of the new free through routes.]]

In February 2004, TfL issued a consultation document<ref name="tfl20040216">{{Cite press release |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/4375.aspx |title=Londoners views sought on c-charge western extension |date=16 February 2004 |publisher=[[Transport for London]] | accessdate=6 January 2008}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref> on the expansion of the zone to the west that would cover the rest (western portion) of Westminster and the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]].

In August 2004, following Livingstone's re-election in the [[London mayoral election, 2004|June 2004 mayoral election]], the results of the consultation were published. A substantial majority of respondents did not want the extension,<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4296968.stm |title= Congestion Charge Zone to expand |publisher=BBC News   |date=30 September 2005 |accessdate=26 May 2007}}</ref> however Livingstone said he was going ahead and that the polls were a "charade" which did not diminish his electoral mandate.

These included a plan to reduce the operating hours of the charge by half-an-hour to "boost trade at London's theatres, restaurants and cinemas".<ref>{{Cite press release |publisher=[[Transport for London]] |title=Public Consultation on detail of proposed extension to congestion charging zone begins |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/4052.aspx |date=9 May 2005 |accessdate=28 May 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071001001835/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/4052.aspx |archivedate = 1 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4529009.stm |title=Charge zone times could shorten |publisher=BBC News   |date=9 May 2005 |accessdate=11 October 2005}}</ref>

At the end of September 2005, London Mayor Ken Livingstone confirmed the western expansion of the congestion charge, which came into effect on 19 February 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/congest/western-extension.jsp |title=Congestion Charging Western Extension | publisher=[[Greater London Authority]] |accessdate =8 April 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060410231123/http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/congest/western-extension.jsp |archivedate = 10 April 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |first=Ben |last=Webster |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1805811,00.html |title=Livingstone takes charge zone farther west despite opposition |work=The Times |location=UK |publisher=News International Limited |date=1 October 2005 |accessdate=9 April 2006 }}</ref> It was expected that the extension would increase congestion in the zone by around 5% as the 60,000 residents in the new zone will be entitled to the discounts available.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/capitals-congestion-charge-area-extended-437008.html |work=The Independent |publisher=Independent News and Media Limited |title=Capital's congestion charge area extended |first=Peter |last=Woodman |date=19 February 2007 |accessdate=26 May 2007 | location=London}}</ref> Several roads were also to be left charge-free between the original zone and the extension.<ref name="bbcextfeature" />

However, the current Mayor of London, [[Boris Johnson]], at the beginning of his administration, announced that he would discard plans for extending the charge zone to the suburbs, and also announced he will review the western extension implemented in 2007, based on a public consultation planned for September 2008.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/jul/02/london.congestioncharging| title=Transport: London Mayor unveils congestion charge rethink|author=Dan Milmo |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=2 July 2008|accessdate=16 August 2008}}</ref> Having held a five-week public consultation with residents in autumn 2008, Johnson agreed to remove the western extension of the congestion charging zone by 2010.

On 20 October 2010, TfL announced that Mayor Johnson decided to remove the Western Extension which, together with other changes to the scheme, were scheduled to take effect from 4 January 2011. However, because there is no charging due to the Christmas holidays, charging on the Western extension effectively ended on 24 December 2010.<ref name=TfL2011>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/congestioncharging/17094.aspx|title=Consultation results|publisher=[[Transport for London]]|accessdate=6 December 2010}}</ref>

=== Transponder charging ===
TfL ran a six month trial of "tag and beacon" (transponder) from February 2006 to replace the camera based system. This uses an electronic card affixed to the [[windscreen]] of a vehicle and can be used to produce "smart tolls" where charges can be varied dependent on time and direction of travel. This system automatically deducts the charge so that the 50,000 drivers a year who forget to pay the fine would not be penalised. TfL has suggested that this scheme could be introduced from 2009.<ref name="wasted" /><ref>{{Cite news |title=Electronic tags for cars as congestion charge spreads out |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article733481.ece |work=The Times |publisher=News International Ltd |date=22 February 2006 |first=Ben |last=Webster |accessdate=27 May 2007 | location=London}}</ref>

=== Blackwall Tunnel charging ===
Transport for London consulted on a charge for the [[Blackwall Tunnel]] in east London, but these proposals have been suspended following significant opposition from the public.<ref>{{Cite news |title=77% reject A12 Blackwall Tunnel toll, says City Hall survey |url=http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/content/towerhamlets/advertiser/news/story.aspx?brand=ELAOnline&category=news&tBrand=northlondon24&tCategory=newsela&itemid=WeED05%20Nov%202007%2013%3A57%3A08%3A843 |work=East London Advertiser |publisher=Archant Regional Limited |date=5 November 2007 |accessdate=24 November 2007}}</ref> Former Mayor Ken Livingstone has stated that he had "absolutely no plans to set up a congestion charging zone to charge vehicles that use the Blackwall Tunnel or the Blackwall Tunnel Approach Road.

=== Emissions based fee structure ===
A new emissions-based fee structure was proposed by mayor [[Ken Livingstone]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |title=CO2 charging |author=Transport for London |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/congestioncharging/7394.aspx | accessdate=6 April 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080403045509/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/congestioncharging/7394.aspx |archivedate = 3 April 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>  It would have charged more for drivers in higher CO<sub>2</sub> emission rate [[Vehicle Excise Duty]] bands.

==== History ====
The proposal was put forward the end of 2006 by [[Ken Livingstone]]; a variable congestion charge based on the [[Vehicle Excise Duty]] (VED) bands would be introduced. This would reduce or eliminate the charge for ''Band A'' vehicles, and increase it to up to <U+00A3>25 a day for ''Band G'' vehicles, with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions greater than 225 g/km.<ref>{{cite web

The main change would be the introduction of two new fees:

TfL had not clarified whether the <U+00A3>25 daily charge would be linked to the band until the point became moot as the scheme was cancelled.

Acting director of the RAC Sheila Raingner stated that "The congestion charge was originally developed to reduce congestion. Changing this will confuse the public and reduce support and trust for future initiatives."<ref>{{Cite news

At the request of Porsche, [[King's College London|King's College]] released the full report of the possible effects of the new system that was originally commissioned by [[Transport for London]]. This report indicated that the proposed new system would reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in central London by 2,200 tonnes by 2012, but would increase CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 182,000 tonnes in outer London, due to drivers of more polluting vehicles avoiding congestion charge zones.

Upon the release of this report, a spokesman [[Transport for London]] stated that the methodology used by [[King's College London|King's]] was 'less robust and accurate than TfL's methodology'. They stated that their findings suggested reductions of up to 5000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> by 2009, and claimed that [[King's College London|King's College]] agreed with these results and were making revisions to their report.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7338606.stm 'C-charge hike 'will increase CO2''] BBC News</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/04/10/cncharge110.xml |title='Row over Congestion Charge pollution claims' |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=10 April 2008 |accessdate=12 December 2010  |first=Roland |last=Gribben}}</ref>
