'''''Triaenops menamena''''' is a [[bat]] in the genus ''[[Triaenops]]'' found on [[Madagascar]], mainly in the drier regions. It was known as ''Triaenops rufus'' until 2009, when it was discovered that that name had been incorrectly applied to the species. ''Triaenops rufus'' is a [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] of ''[[Triaenops persicus]]'', a Middle Eastern species closely related to ''T.&nbsp;menamena''<U+2014> the Malagasy species had previously been placed as a [[subspecies]] of ''T.&nbsp;persicus'' by some authors. ''Triaenops menamena'' is mostly found in forests, but also occurs in other habitats. It often roosts in large colonies and eats insects such as [[lepidoptera|butterflies and moths]]. Because of its wide range, common occurrence, and tolerance of [[habitat degradation]], it is not considered to be threatened.

With a forearm length of 50 to 56&nbsp;mm (2.0 to 2.2&nbsp;in) in males and 46 to 53&nbsp;mm (1.8 to 2.1&nbsp;in) in females, this is a medium-sized bat. Its fur color is variable, ranging from reddish-brown to gray, but it is generally darker than the species in the closely related genus ''[[Paratriaenops]]'' which also occur on Madagascar. The skull contains a pronounced swelling around the nose and the second upper [[premolar]] is displaced outside the toothrow. The maximum frequency of the [[animal echolocation|echolocation]] call averages 94.2&nbsp;k[[hertz|Hz]] and the species can easily be recognized on the basis of its call.

==Taxonomy==
In 1881, [[Alphonse Milne-Edwards]] described two new species in the genus ''[[Triaenops]]'' on the basis of specimens supposedly collected by [[L<U+00E9>on Humblot]] on Madagascar: the reddish ''Triaenops rufus'' and the larger, gray ''T. humbloti''.<ref>Milne-Edwards, 1881, p.&nbsp;1035</ref> [[Jean Dorst]], who reviewed Madagascan ''Triaenops'' in 1947, retained both as separate species; in another review, published in 1982, [[John Edwards Hill]] considered the two to represent the same species. In 1994, [[Karl Koopman]] considered ''rufus'' itself to be part of the Middle Eastern and mainland African species ''[[Triaenops persicus]]'', a possibility Hill had discussed,<ref>Goodman and Ranivo, 2009, p.&nbsp;47; Benda and Vallo, 2009, table&nbsp;1</ref> but most authors regarded the two as distinct species.<ref name=BV7>Benda and Vallo, 2009, p.&nbsp;7</ref> In 2006, Julie Ranivo and [[Steven Goodman]] revised Madagascan ''Triaenops'' and found little variation among specimens of ''T.&nbsp;rufus'' from throughout the dry parts of the island.<ref>Ranivo and Goodman, 2007, pp.&nbsp;963, 975</ref> Three years later, they published another paper which showed that the original material of ''T.&nbsp;rufus'' and ''T.&nbsp;humbloti'' was distinct from Madagascan specimens identified as "''Triaenops rufus''" and more similar to ''T.&nbsp;persicus''.<ref name=GR52>Goodman and Ranivo, 2009, p.&nbsp;52</ref> On his journey to Madagascar, Humblot had stayed in Somalia and Yemen, and Goodman and Ranivo concluded that he had probably collected the ''Triaenops'' there, after which their provenance was incorrectly recorded.<ref>Goodman and Ranivo, 2009, pp.&nbsp;52<U+2013>53</ref> Thus, ''rufus'' and ''humbloti'' cannot be used for the Madagascan species, and Goodman and Ranivo proposed the new name ''Triaenops menamena'' for the species formerly known as ''T.&nbsp;rufus''. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''menamena'' is [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] for "reddish", referring to the animal's coloration.<ref name=GR54>Goodman and Ranivo, 2009, p.&nbsp;54</ref> "Rufous trident bat" has been used as a [[common name]] for ''Triaenops rufus''.<ref name=iucn/>

''Triaenops menamena'' is currently one of four living species in the genus ''Triaenops''; a 2009 revision by Petr Benda and Peter Vallo split off the African ''[[Triaenops afer|T.&nbsp;afer]]'' and the Yemeni ''[[Triaenops parvus|T.&nbsp;parvus]]'' from ''T.&nbsp;persicus'' and removed three other species, including two from Madagascar, to the separate genus ''[[Paratriaenops]]''.<ref>Benda and Vallo, 2009, p.&nbsp;34</ref> An extinct species, ''[[Triaenops goodmani]]'', is known from northwestern Madagascar.<ref name="S46"/> In 2007 and 2008, Amy Russell and colleagues used [[phylogenetic]] and [[coalescent theory|coalescent]] methodologies to investigate the history of the ''Triaenops'' group. They found that ''T.&nbsp;menamena'' (as ''T.&nbsp;rufus'') was closest to mainland African ''Triaenops'' (but did not study Middle Eastern bats) and concluded that ''T.&nbsp;menamena'' and the species of ''Paratriaenops'' (then still placed in ''Triaenops'') independently reached Madagascar from Africa; the colonization of the island by ''T.&nbsp;menamena'' was dated to about 660,000 years ago.<ref>Russell et al., 2007, p.&nbsp;839; 2008, p.&nbsp;995</ref> Benda and Vallo also studied phylogenetic relationships in ''Triaenops'' and included Middle Eastern ''T.&nbsp;persicus'' and ''T.&nbsp;parvus'' in their analysis. They found little resolution of relationships within ''Triaenops'', but some evidence suggested that ''T.&nbsp;menamena'' is more closely related to the Middle Eastern species than to ''T.&nbsp;afer'' in mainland Africa; therefore, ''T.&nbsp;menamena'' may have reached Madagascar from the Middle East or northeastern Africa. They also placed the split between ''T.&nbsp;menamena'' and the other species much further back, at around 4 million years ago.<ref>Benda and Vallo, 2009, pp.&nbsp;27<U+2013>28</ref>

''Triaenops menamena'' is a medium-sized species with variable fur coloration, ranging from reddish-brown to gray. It is larger and darker than ''Paratriaenops auritus'' and ''P.&nbsp;furculus''.<ref name=Pea82/> Among living ''Triaenops'' species, it is smaller than ''T.&nbsp;persicus'' and ''T.&nbsp;afer'', but somewhat larger than ''T.&nbsp;parvus''.<ref name=BV29/> The extinct ''Triaenops goodmani'', which is known only from three [[mandible]]s (lower jaws), is also larger.<ref name=S46>Samonds, 2007, p.&nbsp;46</ref> In the complexly shaped [[noseleaf]] (a group of fleshy structures around the nose and mouth),<ref name=Y119/> ''T.&nbsp;menamena'' has the trident structure characteristic of ''Triaenops'' and ''Paratriaenops'': three adjacent lancets (projecting structures) on the posterior leaf. In ''T.&nbsp;menamena'', the two outer lancets are shorter than the middle one and curved, whereas the three lancets are more equal in ''Paratriaenops''.<ref>Goodman and Ranivo, 2008, p.&nbsp;686</ref> The anterior leaf contains a broad, flat, horizontal [[process (anatomy)|process]] and the intermediate leaf contains a pointed process.<ref name=Y120>Yoshiyuki, 1995, p.&nbsp;120</ref> The ears are small and broad<ref name=Y119>Yoshiyuki, 1995, p.&nbsp;119</ref> and contain notches on the inner side.<ref name=Pea82>Peterson et al., 1995, p.&nbsp;82</ref> The fur is silky and the hairs on the body are about 5 to 6&nbsp;mm long. The wing membrane is dark and translucent and the end of the tail usually projects from the [[uropatagium]] (tail membrane).<ref name=Y120/> Males average slightly larger than females.<ref name="Goodman 2006, p. 982"/> Wingspan is 270 to 305&nbsp;mm (10.6 to 12.0&nbsp;in).<ref>Garbutt, 2007, p.&nbsp;71</ref>

The skull is similar to that of Madagascan ''Paratriaenops'', but the [[premaxilla]] is longer. The rostrum (front part of the skull) is well-developed and contains a pronounced nasal swelling, which is less pronounced than in ''Paratriaenops''; the depression behind the swelling is relatively shallow.<ref name=RG971/> Compared to other species of ''Triaenops'', the rostrum is relatively narrow and short, similar to ''T.&nbsp;parvus''; ''T.&nbsp;afer'' and ''T.&nbsp;persicus'' have a broader rostrum.<ref name=BV29>Benda and Vallo, 2010, p.&nbsp;29</ref> The front margin of the rostrum is cast back between the left and right corners. A transverse line passes over the roof of the rostrum.<ref name=RG971>Ranivo and Goodman, 2006, p.&nbsp;971</ref> The [[infraorbital foramen]], an opening in the skull, is oblong in shape. The [[zygomatic arch]]es (cheekbones) are not broadened towards the sides, are connected to the [[maxilla]]ries by broad bones, and contain clear crests on their upper sides. In ''T.&nbsp;menamena'', these crests are rectangular in form and larger than in ''Paratriaenops''.<ref name=RG972/> The [[braincase]] is lower than in other species of ''Triaenops''.<ref>Benda and Vallo, 2010, pp.&nbsp;29<U+2013>30</ref> The [[sagittal crest]], which is on the roof of the braincase, is poorly developed.<ref name=RG972>Ranivo and Goodman, 2006, p.&nbsp;972</ref> In the mandible, the [[coronoid process of the mandible|coronoid process]] is blunt and rounded, but the [[angular process]] (both [[process (anatomy)|processes]] at the back of the bone) is small.<ref name=RG974>Ranivo and Goodman, 2006, p.&nbsp;974</ref>

The upper [[incisor]]s have two cusps and the upper [[canine (tooth)|canine]] has three<U+2014>a large central one, a small but well-developed one at the back, and a small cuspule at the front.<ref name=RG974/> The front upper [[premolar]] is projected outside the toothrow, so that the canine before it and back premolar behind it touch.<ref name=Pea82/> The first lower incisor has two cusps and the second has three.<ref name=RG974/> On the second lower molar, the [[protoconid]] cusp is notably taller than the [[hypoconid]]; these cusps are about as high in ''T.&nbsp;goodmani''.<ref name=S46/>

The species can easily be identified from recordings of its [[animal echolocation|echolocation]] call.<ref>Kofoky et al., 2007, p.&nbsp;1042</ref> The call consists of a component with constant frequency followed by a short one with changing frequency. The call takes 6.5 to 13.5&nbsp;[[millisecond|ms]], averaging 10.1&nbsp;ms, and the period between two calls is 22.7 to 86.3&nbsp;ms, averaging 42.7&nbsp;ms. The maximum frequency averages 94.2&nbsp;kHz, the minimum frequency averages 82.0&nbsp;kHz, and the call emits the most energy at a frequency of 93.2&nbsp;kHz.<ref>Kofoky et al., 2009, table&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;380, fig.&nbsp;4a</ref>

==Distribution and ecology==
''Triaenops menamena'' mainly occurs in the dry regions of western Madagascar, but has also been recorded in humid areas in the far southeast and northeast,<ref name=GR54/> and is found up to 1300&nbsp;m (4300&nbsp;ft) above sea level.<ref name=iucn/> It mainly occurs in forests,<ref name=Kea1049>Kofoky et al., 2007, p.&nbsp;1049</ref> but has also been recorded outside forest and is not dependent on it.<ref name=iucn/> An obligate cave dweller,<ref>Racey et al., 2010, p.&nbsp;392</ref> it is known to roost in large colonies, with one cave colony estimated to contain over 40,000 bats; this cave also contained an estimated 10,000 ''Paratriaenops furculus''.<ref>Olsson et al., 2006, p.&nbsp;402; Kofoky et al., 2007, p.&nbsp;1047</ref> The [[effective population size]] of the species is estimated to be about 121,000.<ref>Russell et al., 2008, p.&nbsp;998</ref> [[Lepidoptera]] (butterflies and moths) form the main component of its diet, but it also eats [[Coleoptera]] (beetles) and [[Hemiptera]] (bugs) and fewer members of some other insect orders.<ref>Rakotoarivelo et al., 2007, table&nbsp;2</ref> It is unclear how the [[ecological niche]]s of ''Triaenops'' and the less frequently captured ''Paratriaenops furculus'' are separated, as both eat lepidopterans and occur in the same regions.<ref>Rakotoarivelo et al., 2007, p.&nbsp;964</ref>

==Conservation status==
Under ''Triaenops rufus'', the [[IUCN Red List]] lists this species as being of "[[Least Concern]]", citing its common occurrence over a wide distribution and tolerance of human modifications of its habitat, even though its forest habitat is being destroyed in places. It has been recorded in numerous [[protected area]]s.<ref name=iucn>Andriafidison et al., 2008</ref> Bats, mainly the large ''[[Hipposideros commersoni]]'', are sometimes hunted for food in southwestern Madagascar, and ''T.&nbsp;menamena'' is also taken incidentally.<ref>Goodman, 2006, pp.&nbsp;225<U+2013>226</ref>
