== History ==
Micro<U+00EF>ds was founded in 1985 by Elliot Grassiano. For the first 10 years, Micro<U+00EF>ds was a development house, but in 1995 they expanded into publishing and distribution as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.virtools.com/applications/games-microidspm.asp |title=Virtools Development Applications |publisher=[[Virtools]] |accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref> Micro<U+00EF>ds France at this time was located in [[V<U+00E9>lizy]] (near Paris), [[France]]. The company also then expanded worldwide with a publisher in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] (''Micro<U+00EF>ds Italy''), distributor in [[Milton Keynes]], [[United Kingdom]] (''Micro<U+00EF>ds Ltd'') and a developer in [[Montr<U+00E9>al]], [[Canada]] (''Micro<U+00EF>ds Canada Inc.'').

In 2003, Emmanuel Olivier (founder of [[Index+]]) created a new company called [[MC2 France]] which subsequently merged with Micro<U+00EF>ds. In September 2003 MC2-Micro<U+00EF>ds acquired [[Wanadoo Edition]] as part of a deal with the French government for Micro<U+00EF>ds to emerge from bankruptcy protection.  As part of the deal, [[Wanadoo]] also became a 12% shareholder of Micro<U+00EF>ds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adventuregamers.com/newsitem.php?id=253 |title=Microids takes over Wanadoo's games division |publisher=Adventure Gamers |date=2003-10-02 |accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref> Emmanuel Olivier became CEO when Elliot Grassiano left the company.

In March 2005 [[Ubisoft]] announced their intention to acquire MC2-Micro<U+00EF>ds ''(Micro<U+00EF>ds Canada)'' and to integrate it into Ubisoft's Montreal studios.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ubi.com/ENCA/News/Info.aspx?nId=2028 |title=Ubisoft Montreal enters into an agreement to acquire Microids Canada's development operations |publisher=Ubisoft |date=2005-03-02 |accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref>  This deal only included fifty of MC2-Micro<U+00EF>ds' employees and technical equipment; however, the agreement did not include any transfer of [[intellectual property]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justadventure.com/articles/Ubisoft_EA/Ubisoft_EA.shtm |title=Ubisoft acquires MC2-Micro<U+00EF>ds |publisher=Just Adventure |date=2005-03-03 |accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref> ''Micro<U+00EF>ds Italy'' split off from the company in 2005, turning into the Italian publisher ''[[Blue Label Entertainment]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blelabel.it/?pageId=blelabel |title=Profilo dell<U+2019>azienda |publisher=Blue Label Entertainment |language=Italian |accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref>

On November 28, 2007 MC2 France officially relaunched the Micro<U+00EF>ds brand<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microids.com/en/press/8/emmanuel-olivier-and-index+-founders-relaunch-microids.html |title=Emmanuel Olivier and Index+ Founders Relaunch MICRO<U+00CF>DS |date=2007-11-28 |accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref>, with all of the company's future productions to be released either under the ''MICRO<U+00CF>DS Montreal'' or ''MICRO<U+00CF>DS Paris'' brands.  The headquarters of the company are in [[Montrouge]] a suburb of [[Paris]] and they have a development studio in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]], hence the two brands. In December 2007 they opened an online store, powered by [[Metaboli]].

On 20 October 2008 Micro<U+00EF>ds acquired the brands and intellectual property of [[Cryo Interactive]], who had been declared bankrupt in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microids.com/en/press/16/microids-acquires-the-cryo-catalogue-and-brands.html |title=Micro<U+00EF>ds acquires the Cryo catalogue and brands |publisher=Micro<U+00EF>ds |date=2008-10-20 |accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> On 5 November the Micro<U+00EF>ds online store was improved and relaunched.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microids.com/en/press/19/microids-opens-the-microids-shop.html |title=Micro<U+00EF>ds opens the Micro<U+00EF>ds Shop |publisher=Micro<U+00EF>ds |date=2008-11-05 |accessdate=2008-11-05}}</ref>

[[File:Microids Logo.jpg|thumb|100px|Logo circa 2005.]]
Since the creation of Micro<U+00EF>ds in 1984 the company has had a number of different logos, utilising two main designs. There is the original curvy stylised letter M logo, which may look like a simple drawing of a bird; initially this had a background depicting a 3D scene.<ref name="aboutus">{{cite web |url=http://www.microids.com/en/about-us/ |title=About us |publisher=Micro<U+00EF>ds |year=2007 |accessdate=2009-12-07}}</ref> Fellow French video game developer with links to Micro<U+00EF>ds, [[White Birds]], also use similar simple drawings of birds as their logo. In the mid-1990s the company changed their logo slightly to contain the colours of the rainbow, but without a background. This logo remained until the merger with MC2 France, when a red/grey logo was used. By the time of ''Still Life'' being released the company was using a logo containing a blocky stylised letter M and dot below it.<ref name="aboutus"/> In 2005 this had a smooth typeface and no dots above the letter i. By the relaunch of the brand in 2007 the stylised M logo had dots placed above the letter i and a different typeface.<ref name="aboutus"/>
