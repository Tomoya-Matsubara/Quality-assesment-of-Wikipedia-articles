The '''1893<U+2013>94 season''' was the 13th season of competitive [[association football]] and second season in [[the Football League]] played by [[Small Heath F.C.]], an English football club based in [[Birmingham]]. In [[1892<U+2013>93 Small Heath F.C. season|1892<U+2013>93]], the [[1892<U+2013>93 Football League|inaugural season]] of the [[Football League Second Division]], Small Heath had won the divisional championship but failed to gain [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] via the [[test match (association football)|test match]] system. This year, they finished as distant runners-up in the League, eight points behind [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], but were successful in the test match, defeating [[Darwen F.C.|Darwen]] 3<U+2013>1 to confirm their place in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] for the [[1894<U+2013>95 Football League]] season. The club struggled financially during the season, and there were suggestions that it might have disbanded had promotion not been secured.

Small Heath entered the [[1893<U+2013>94 FA Cup]] in the first round proper, and lost in that round for the second consecutive year, this time to the eventual losing finalists, [[Bolton Wanderers]] of the First Division. In local competitions, they were eliminated by [[Midland Football League|Midland League]] club [[Loughborough F.C.|Loughborough]] in the first round of the [[Birmingham Senior Cup]] and by [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in the semi-final of the [[Birmingham Charity Cup|Mayor of Birmingham's Charity Cup]]. Small Heath played fewer [[friendly match]]es than in the previous season, instead competing in a regionally organised supplementary competition, the United Counties League<!-- not the same as the current [[United Counties League]] -->, in which they finished third of four teams in the southern section.

Small Heath used 23 different players in nationally organised competitive matches during the season and had 12 different goalscorers. Four players, [[Ted Devey]], [[Fred Wheldon]], [[Tommy Hands]] and [[Billy Ollis]], appeared in every League match, all but Devey for the second consecutive season. The top scorer was inside-forward [[Frank Mobley]] with 25&nbsp;goals <U+2013> his total of 24&nbsp;League goals made him the Second Division's leading scorer <U+2013> and all five first-choice [[forward (association football)|forwards]] reached double figures for the second season running.

==Background==
Small Heath were elected to the newly formed [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1892, and went on to win the divisional championship. However, [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the First Division depended on the [[test match (association football)|test match system]], in which each of the lowest-ranked three teams from the First Division played off against one of the highest-ranked three from the Second Division. Small Heath lost to [[Manchester United F.C.|Newton Heath]] after a [[replay (sports)|replay]], so were not promoted.<ref>{{cite book |title=Forward, Arsenal! |first=Bernard |last=Joy |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zxavt42c3t0C&pg=PA8 |page=8 |year=2009 |origyear=1952 |publisher=GCR Books |isbn=978-0-9559211-1-7}}</ref> The League's Annual General Meeting heard proposals that the First Division be expanded to either 20 or 18 teams. Both motions were, unsurprisingly, seconded by Small Heath, but both were defeated, thus confirming that the team would play in the Second Division for the 1893<U+2013>94 season.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sports and Pastimes |newspaper=The Preston Chronicle and Lancashire Advertiser |date=27 May 1893 |page=5}}</ref> The Second Division championship shield was presented to the club at a meeting of the Football League held at the Colonnade Hotel in New Street, Birmingham, in August.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Football League |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=3 August 1893 |page=8}}</ref>

Small Heath opened their second season in [[the Football League]] with a visit to [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]], who were playing at [[Wednesbury]] because their new ground was not yet ready. Former Small Heath full-back [[Tom Bayley]] was one of several newcomers for the hosts, but their visitors had few changes in personnel. [[Teddy Jolley]] came in at full-back, and replacing [[Billy Walton]] was [[John Lee (footballer)|Jack Lee]], who "dribbles cleverly, and is a very dangerous forward round goal". In the presence of 4,000 spectators, Lee scored twice as Small Heath won 3<U+2013>1.<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=4 September 1893 |page=5}}</ref> [[Fred Wheldon]] opened the scoring for Small Heath in the first 30&nbsp;seconds of their next match, at home to [[Rotherham Town]]; 15&nbsp;minutes later the visitors were 3<U+2013>2 ahead, but by half-time the home side had regained the lead. Unsurprisingly the tempo dropped in the second half, but a game played in a "friendly and sportsmanlike spirit" was marred towards the end by Rotherham forward [[Alf Pickering]] suffering a fracture of his right leg just below the knee in an accidental collision with [[Bernard Pumfrey]], "the snap of the bone being heard all round the ground".<ref>{{cite news |title=Yesterday's Football |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=5 September 1893 |page=5}}</ref> Initial reports suggested the break was such that he was "almost certain" never to play football again.<ref>{{cite news |title=Summary of News |newspaper=The Sheffield & Rotherham Independent |date=5 September 1893 |page=5}}</ref> This was followed by a comfortable 6<U+2013>1 defeat of [[Burton Swifts]], in which Jolley moved to [[inside right]] in [[Jack Hallam]]'s absence through illness, giving [[Gilbert Smith (footballer born 1869)|Gilbert Smith]] his debut at full back.<ref>{{cite news |title=Saturday's Football |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=11 September 1893 |page=7}}</ref>

In the return fixture against Walsall, [[Charles Izon]], a well-built forward who "is quick on the ball, and shoots excellently", scored a [[hat-trick]] on his debut as Small Heath again won comfortably.<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=18 September 1893 |page=7}}</ref> A visit to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] gave [[Caesar Jenkyns]] the honour of scoring the first Football League goal conceded by the home side, but the visitors "fell all to pieces" in the second half, and were decisively beaten. The young and inexperienced Smith made mistakes that cost two goals, but the forwards "were undoubtedly the weak spot", and the ''Birmingham Daily Post'''s reporter suggested they would "have to learn to shoot harder and play with far more spirit if they are to keep up the reputation they gained last season".<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=25 September 1893 |page=7}}</ref> After [[Burslem Port Vale]] "beat Small Heath on Monday in more decided a fashion than did Liverpool", by five goals to nil,<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Leicester Chronicle and the Leicestershire Mercury |date=30 September 1893 |page=3}}</ref> the poor form shown in the previous two matches by the forwards, and by Wheldon in particular, was much improved at [[Manchester City F.C.|Ardwick]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=2 October 1893 |page=7}}</ref> Although Small Heath scored only once, the resultant win was enough to take them into October in second place in the division, having already completed a quarter of the 28-game league programme.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/division-two-old/1893-1894/table/1893-09-30 |title=English Division Two (old) 1893<U+2013>1894 : Table on 30.09.1893 |publisher=Statto Organisation |accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref>

[[File:CaesarJenkyns.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Caesar Jenkyns]], Small Heath's [[captain (association football)|captain]]|alt=Head and upper torso of a young dark-haired man with thick eyebrows and a large moustache. He is looking straight ahead, and is wearing a tasselled cap and open-necked striped sports shirt.]]Small Heath came back from a 2<U+2013>1 half-time deficit to beat [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] 5<U+2013>2,<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=9 October 1893 |page=7}}</ref> but the visit of Liverpool was eventful in a rather different manner. After the referee rejected the Liverpool players' claim that Small Heath's equaliser had entered the goal through a hole in the side netting, their play became rough, culminating in centre-half [[Joe McQue]], a "strapping fellow", kicking [[Frank Mobley]] in the abdomen, apparently intentionally. While the referee was cautioning McQue, Small Heath captain Caesar Jenkyns rushed in, knocked McQue to the ground, and was sent off. With a man advantage, it still took Liverpool until the stroke of time to score the winning goal. The ''Post'''s reporter suggested that, despite the provocation, Jenkyns should not have reacted the way he did, but "the knowledge that it cost his side the game" was sufficient punishment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=16 October 1893 |page=7}}</ref> Despite the referee in his report agreeing that "the punishment of being sent off would meet case", and that Jenkyns had "played a perfectly fair game" and had expressed regret at his actions, both when dismissed and after the game,<ref>{{cite news |title=Sports and Pastimes |newspaper=The Derby Mercury |date=1 November 1893 |page=7}}</ref> [[the Football Association]] imposed a four-week suspension, to begin on 31 October.<ref name=Arsenal>{{cite news |title=Yesterday's Football |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=31 October 1893 |page=7}}</ref>

In the meantime the play of Jenkyns and his fellow half-backs was instrumental in a 4<U+2013>1 defeat of [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]]. The first half hour was played "in a spiritless fashion", but then Wheldon scored "a fine goal with one of his characteristic shots", and the remainder of the game was one-sided.<ref name=Arsenal/> The Small Heath team prepared for their match at [[Newcastle United]] by taking the train as far as [[York]] on the Friday evening, which left only another {{convert|70|mi}} for the day of the match. Contrary to expectation, Small Heath were successful in a "hard game", with the half-backs again influential despite Jenkyns receiving a "nasty blow in the mouth".<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=30 October 1893 |page=7}}</ref> They ended October level on points with three other clubs, in third place on [[goal average]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/division-two-old/1893-1894/table/1893-10-28 |title=English Division Two (old) 1893<U+2013>1894 : Table on 28.10.1893 |publisher=Statto Organisation |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref>

===November===

While most of the Second Division clubs were involved in FA Cup qualifying ties, Small Heath, who had received a bye to the first round proper, lost a [[friendly match]] against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]{{'s}} [[reserve team]] by five goals to nil. Everton's near neighbours Liverpool complained to the League that the game adversely affected the attendance at their home fixture with Newcastle, but the League confirmed that Everton were within their rights to arrange the match.<ref name=EvertonFriendly/><ref>{{cite news |title=Football. The Football League |newspaper=The Sheffield & Rotherham Independent |date=17 November 1893 |page=8}}</ref> "Better forward play [had] rarely been witnessed at Lincoln than that shown by Small Heath" in a 5<U+2013>2 defeat of [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], whose defence failed to cope with the industry and creativity of [[Teddy Jolley]] feeding the "light but nimble" forwards, Mobley in particular.<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=13 November 1893 |page=7}}</ref> The next weekend, numerous matches were postponed or abandoned because of the weather. Although the Small Heath and [[Crewe Alexandra]] players were changed and ready to play, the referee would not start the game because the "blinding snowstorm would prevent him from having a proper sight of the play".<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=20 November 1893 |page=7}}</ref>

===December===

Jenkyns returned from suspension against a [[Northwich Victoria]] side bottom of the division and playing with only ten men. Wheldon scored four and Mobley three in an 8<U+2013>0 win,<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=4 December 1893 |page=7}}</ref> and the goalscoring continued in midweek in the fixture postponed because of the snowstorm, as Small Heath beat a [[Crewe Alexandra]] side without several first-choice players by six goals to one.<ref>{{cite news |title=Yesterday's Football |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=7 December 1893 |page=7}}</ref> [[Burton Swifts]] proved more difficult opponents. On a heavy pitch, play was concentrated in the midfield area as the strength of both teams lay in their half backs, and Small Heath's winning goal came with ten minutes of the match remaining. It was reported that the club had turned down a "big offer" from First Division club [[Aston Villa]] for the services of Fred Wheldon.<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=11 December 1893 |page=7}}</ref> [[Newcastle United]] travelled to Birmingham on the Friday, to be fresh for Saturday's match, as Small Heath had done in the reverse fixture, and again, the tactic worked.<ref>{{cite news |title=''Observer''{{'s}} Pencillings |newspaper=Northern Echo |date=19 December 1893 |page=4}}</ref> Their forwards "displayed excellent combination", were "splendidly supported by the half-backs", and "but for [Jenkyns'] untiring efforts matters would have been worse" than the 4<U+2013>1 defeat.<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=18 December 1893 |page=7}}</ref>

Changes were made for the visit of [[Middlesbrough Ironopolis]], [[Arthur Littleford]], [[Charles Izon]] and [[Bernard Pumfrey]] coming in for Smith, Mobley and [[Jack Hallam]]. The half-backs were again the backbone of the team, and Wheldon, who produced "a brilliant exposition of dodging and shooting", scored the winning goal five minutes from time in what the ''Standard'''s reporter described as a "rattling good game".<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=25 December 1893 |page=7}}<br>{{cite news |title=Football |newspaper=The Standard |location=London |date=25 December 1893 |page=7}}</ref> [[Fred Speller]] was reported to have "not been seen in such form since his leg was broken last year" in a [[Boxing Day]] friendly with top amateur club [[Marlow F.C.|Marlow]], the club from which he signed for Small Heath.

Pumfrey strengthened the defence, [[George Hollis]] was as usual secure in goal, and the forwards, with the returning Mobley and the introduction of reserve-team player [[Walter Jackson (footballer)|Walter Jackson]], "showed better combination and greater dash than they have recently done".<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=1 January 1894 |page=7}}<br>{{cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/division-two-old/1893-1894/table/1893-09-30 |title=English Division Two (old) 1893<U+2013>1894 : Table on 30.09.1893 |publisher=Statto Organisation |accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref>

===January===

[[File:FredWheldonDart18980304.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Fred Wheldon]]|alt=Head and shoulders of a young, clean-shaven man with dark hair parted on the left of centre. He is looking to his right, and is wearing a light-coloured sports shirt with dark collar and trim.]]On New Year's Day, Small Heath made the short trip to [[Wellington Road|Perry Barr]] for a friendly with [[Aston Villa]]. After a dull and goalless first half, [[Tommy Hands]] crossed the ball for Wheldon to open the scoring, from which point goals followed regularly until the match finished as a 4<U+2013>3 home win. Wheldon was involved in two of his side's three goals, but was "too closely watched by [[Jack Reynolds (footballer born 1869)|Reynolds]] to be as effective as usual".<ref name=VillaFriendly/> On a day when the hard and slippery surface meant "those teams whose players have the least regard for the safety of their limbs usually gain the victory", Small Heath, without Hallam, who was unwell, and [[William Reynolds (footballer born 1870)|William Reynolds]], injured against Aston Villa, defeated a "very indifferent" [[Northwich Victoria]] 7<U+2013>0.<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=8 January 1894 |page=7}}</ref> In their next match, at [[Crewe Alexandra]], the home players reportedly played "with supreme indifference to the safety of their opponents' limbs". Hands, who had been one of Small Heath's better performers, was carried off after receiving a "nasty kick" to the leg, but despite having to play with ten men, the visitors won 5<U+2013>3. Of Crewe's three goals, the first should have been disallowed for offside and the third was a [[Ted Devey]] own goal.<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=15 January 1894 |page=7}}</ref>

[[Midland Football League|Midland League]] club [[Loughborough F.C.|Loughborough]] hosted Small Heath in the first round of the [[Birmingham Senior Cup]]. In heavy rain, the scores were level until ten minutes from time, when goalkeeper [[George Hollis]] was barged into the goal before he could get to a shot from distance. The ball followed him over the line, and despite the obstruction on the goalkeeper, the referee awarded Loughborough a goal. Small Heath threw men forward in search of an equaliser, which left them ill-protected in defence, and they conceded twice more.<ref name=BSC1st/> In the FA Cup, Small Heath were drawn at home to [[Bolton Wanderers]], who were so keen to have the match played on their own ground that they offered Small Heath the total gate receipts up to <U+00A3>150 and a half share of receipts above that figure, with a minimum guarantee of <U+00A3>60, to agree to a change of venue. The offer was declined.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football |newspaper=The North-Eastern Daily Gazette |date=15 January 1894 |page=3}}</ref> Bolton were predicted to lose,<ref>{{cite news |title=Football |newspaper=The Standard |location=London |date=27 January 1894 |page=6}}</ref> but they did not. With the wind behind them, Small Heath took a two-goal half-time lead, but in the second half, Hollis, who had "not given a worse display in goal all season", made numerous mistakes, gifted the visitors two goals, and the final score was 4<U+2013>3 to the First Division side.<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=29 January 1894 |page=7}}</ref>

===February===

Third-placed [[Notts County]] beat Small Heath 3<U+2013>1 to narrow the gap between the clubs to just one point. [[Charles Partridge]], making his Football League debut after Hollis was taken ill, played behind an experimental defensive pairing of half-back [[Ted Devey]] and reserve-team player [[George Short]]. Despite the scoreline, the ''Nottinghamshire Guardian'' described them as "a very useful pair of backs", although not up to the home team's standard, and the ''Daily Post'' rated Devey as "easily the best left-back the club have played this season". Two of Notts' goals were fortunate: an attempted clearance by Devey ricocheted off Jenkyns' head for their second goal, and for their third, the ball appeared to be heading safely over the crossbar until caught by a gust of wind.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sports and Pastimes |newspaper=Nottinghamshire Guardian |date=10 February 1894 |page=3}}<br>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=5 February 1894 |page=7}}</ref>

Eight Midlands clubs formed a league to be played as a supplementary competition to fill vacant dates in the season without the trouble and expense of arranging friendly matches,<ref>{{cite news |title=League Football in the Midlands.

The committee organised a public meeting at which chairman Walter Hart bemoaned the poor attendances, which he felt would not improve unless the team were promoted to the First Division, mentioned that the club had rejected a "big offer from a neighbouring club for the release of a prominent player", and called for <U+00A3>200 to be raised to bring in players to strengthen the team's defence. A collection in the hall raised cash and pledges to the value of [[<U+00A3>sd|<U+00A3>42&nbsp;10s]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Football |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=16 February 1894 |page=7}}</ref> and supporters contributed generously to the public appeal.<ref name=Post19Feb/> An attempt to sign full-back [[John Oliver (footballer)|Jack Oliver]] from [[Middlesbrough Ironopolis]] was unsuccessful,<ref>{{cite news |title=Football |newspaper=The North-Eastern Daily Gazette |date=24 January 1894 |page=3}}</ref> and the club offered the services of goalkeeper [[Chris Charsley]] to [[Aston Villa]].<ref name=WBAUCLH/>

===March===

In front of a large crowd, Small Heath suffered what was described as an "unfortunate" one-goal defeat at [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]]. Hollis should have done better with Grimsby's opener, [[Frank Mobley]] was injured around the eye in collision with the goalkeeper when scoring Small Heath's only goal and showed some bravery in remaining on the field, and Wheldon had an apparently valid goal disallowed. Short, in a "trifle risky" style, and the solid Devey again did well in defence.<ref name=Grimsby>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=5 March 1894 |page=7}}</ref> Lost gate receipts because of Aston Villa's withdrawal from the United Counties League was decidedly unpopular with the other members,<ref name=ForestFriendly/> and the Small Heath committee arranged a [[smoking concert]] to raise funds.<ref name=Ardwick>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=19 March 1894 |page=7}}</ref> Those clubs at the bottom of the First Division and top of the Second were all recruiting new players: "the test matches mean such a lot to the clubs concerned that there is no wonder at this anxiety to secure new blood."<ref>{{cite news |title=Football |newspaper=The North-Eastern Daily Gazette |date=8 March 1894 |page=3}}</ref> Small Heath acquired the services of full-backs [[Percy Watson (footballer)|Percy Watson]] and [[William Purves (footballer)|William Purves]], from [[Rotherham Town]] and Irish club [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] respectively.<ref name=Grimsby/>

The Small Heath club staged a "double-header" the following Saturday. After the reserves beat [[Brierley Hill Alliance]] 3<U+2013>0 in the [[Birmingham & District League]], Watson made a promising debut at back as the first team played a friendly against a below-strength [[Nottingham Forest]] side.<ref name=ForestFriendly/> Charsley returned to first-team duty in a 10<U+2013>2 demolition of [[Manchester City F.C.|Ardwick]], whose goalkeeper arrived with his team already one goal behind.<ref name=Ardwick/> Mobley's fourth [[hat-trick]] gave him ten goals from his last six matches, taking him past the 20-goal mark for the season.<ref name=M142/> A close game at Rotherham produced a 3<U+2013>2 win,<ref>{{cite news |title=Football. The League Championship |newspaper=The Standard |location=London |date=24 March 1894 |page=6}}</ref> and against [[Burslem Port Vale]], the Small Heath forwards had "rarely been seen to greater advantage" as they scored six without reply.<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=26 March 1894 |page=3}}</ref> 

The semi-final of the [[Birmingham Charity Cup]] provided a break from League action. Mobley opened the scoring, but [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] shot against the woodwork on several occasions and the visitors were "singularly fortunate" in restricting the home side to one goal, and that a [[penalty kick]]. With the scores level, a decision was made not to play [[extra time]],<ref name=MBCCSF/> and the replay was arranged for two weeks later at [[Muntz Street|Coventry Road]].<ref name=MBCCSFR/> In their penultimate match of the Football League season, Small Heath produced a good team performance to win 4<U+2013>1 at [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]] and reach 100 League goals for the season. The forwards played a characteristic "beautifully combined" game, the half-backs, particularly Jenkyns, were too strong for the home forwards, Purves looked set to be the full-back the team had needed for some time, and Charsley "kept goal exceedingly well".<ref name=prospects>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=2 April 1894 |page=7}}</ref>

===April===

Against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke]] in the United Counties League, [[Jack Hallam]] opened the scoring after a fine passing move as Small Heath won 3<U+2013>0.<ref>{{cite news |title=Yesterday's Football |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=3 April 1894 |page=7}}</ref> In the return fixture, [[Charles Partridge]]'s "magnificent performance" in goal kept the score down to a 2<U+2013>1 defeat, as Small Heath finished third in the four-team division.<ref name=StokeUCLA/>

Going into the last match of the Football League season, Small Heath were in second place in the division, one point ahead of opponents [[Notts County]]. Neither could challenge [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] for the title, but both were sure of their places in the promotion test matches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/division-two-old/1893-1894/table/1894-03-31 |title=English Division Two (old) 1893<U+2013>1894 : Table on 31.03.1894 |publisher=Statto Organisation |accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref> The likely opponent for the team finishing second would be [[Darwen F.C.|Darwen]], whereas the third-placed team could expect the rather tougher prospect of [[Preston North End]]. Notts County had won the [[1894 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]] the previous weekend, and the ''Daily Post'' took that as a good omen, "inasmuch as the winners of the English Cup rarely do themselves justice on the following Saturday".<ref name=prospects/>

Small Heath were decisive victors by three goals to nil, Hallam's wing play drawing particular praise, as did Jenkyns' "admirable captaincy". The attendance was something over 8,000, of whom 6,800 paid on the day, generating gate receipts of <U+00A3>200. Although the result was rather overshadowed by Aston Villa beating [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] away from home to be confirmed as First Division champions,<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=9 April 1894 |page=7}}</ref> the ''Dart'' clearly appreciated how Small Heath "in a blaze of glory before the largest crowd ever seen at Coventry Road, gave the English Cup holders a licking".<ref>{{cite news |title=Thursday's Gossip |newspaper=The Dart. The Birmingham Pictorial |date=13 April 1894 |page=4}}</ref> 

Handicapped early on by [[George Short]] suffering concussion and being unable to continue, Small Heath lost the replayed Charity Cup semi-final to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] 2<U+2013>0.<ref name=MBCCSFR/> [[Fred Wheldon]] was the only Second Division player selected in the Football League representative team to play the [[Scottish Football League|Scottish League]] at [[Goodison Park]], Liverpool.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football. English League v. Scotch League |newspaper=The Yorkshire Herald |date=11 April 1894 |page=8}}</ref> Expected to join Aston Villa should Small Heath not be promoted, and "thought by many to be the best inside left in England",<ref>{{cite news |title=Football |newspaper=The Isle of Man Times and General Advertiser |last='Grasshopper' |date=17 April 1894 |page=3}}</ref> Wheldon "performed like the clever and finished player he is" as the match was drawn.<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=23 April 1894 |page=7}}</ref> 

The ''Leicester Chronicle'' felt that Darwen would have to "play up" to stand much chance against Small Heath, who had "a smarter set of forwards than can be found amongst most of the first division teams", and pointed out that Small Heath were the only team in either division to have scored 100 goals during the season.<ref>{{cite news |title=Between the Goalposts |newspaper=Leicester Chronicle |date=14 April 1894 |page=12}}</ref> The players prepared for the test match at [[Droitwich Spa]], where the saturated salt water of the Brine Baths provided relief for tired muscles.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sport and Games |newspaper=Berrow's Worcester Journal |date=28 April 1894 |page=6}}</ref> The match, played at Stoke's [[Victoria Ground]], was an exciting one. Darwen had much the best of the first half, but failed to take their chances. Small Heath were restricted to rare attacks, but were dangerous on the break, and opened the scoring through [[Jack Hallam]]. Darwen equalised before the interval, and continued their dominance until superior fitness told. With six minutes left, Small Heath took the lead, the goal variously attributed to Wheldon or an Orr [[own goal]], after which Darwen lost heart and [[Tommy Hands]] scored again four minutes later. The ''Daily Post'' suggested that "one would scarcely believe that they were the same five forwards who have so often delighted the spectators with their play at Coventry Road", but "to every man [of the defence] great praise is due for so ably checking the opposing forwards". The ''Nottinghamshire Guardian'' was less critical of the forwards, but took the view that Small Heath were fortunate to catch Darwen "in a very crippled condition", and that goalkeeper [[Chris Charsley]] had done the club a considerable service in making himself available for such a vital game.<ref name=testmatch>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=30 April 1894 |page=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Sports and Pastimes |newspaper=Nottinghamshire Guardian |date=5 May 1894 |page=3}}</ref> 

The victorious team arrived back in Birmingham by train, the engine's [[Chimney (locomotive)|funnel]] draped in blue and white, to be greeted by 1,000 supporters at [[New Street Station]],<ref name=M9/> and "were loudly cheered on their return to Small Heath".<ref name=testmatch/> The season finished with a friendly against newly crowned Football League champions Aston Villa, the visitors giving their services free for the benefit of the Small Heath club. Before a crowd of four or five thousand, both clubs fielded strong sides, and the match finished as a 3<U+2013>3 draw.<ref name=VillaBenefit/>

==Summary and aftermath==

The ''Daily Post'''s pleasure at Small Heath's victory was heightened by their belief that "defeat would in all probability have meant the disbanding of the club", ambitions of promotion having sustained the committee's efforts throughout the season to raise enough funds to keep the club going. They pointed out that further expense was necessary both to strengthen the team, "for it cannot be expected that eleven or twelve men will stand the strain of a season's work amongst the first division clubs", and to improve facilities at the Coventry Road ground.<ref name=testmatch/> The club held a celebratory dinner, at which the chairman congratulated the players, exhorted them to redouble their efforts to make a decent showing in the First Division, and appealed to their continuing loyalty. He attempted to dispel suggestions that the city could not support two teams in the top division, and expressed gratitude to the Aston Villa club for their sincere best wishes as demonstrated by their generous donation of the recent benefit match.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=3 May 1894 |page=5}}</ref> The balance sheet showed expenditure of <U+00A3>2,039, of which players' wages accounted for <U+00A3>1,303, which resulted in a net loss of <U+00A3>222 when set against income of <U+00A3>1,816, of which <U+00A3>1,586 came from gate receipts and <U+00A3>104 from season tickets.<ref>{{cite news |title=Small Heath Football Club |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=21 June 1894 |page=5}}</ref> Nevertheless, during the close season the club began work on a grandstand and "the furrows on the field of play [were] filled up".<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=6 August 1894 |page=3}}</ref>

Small Heath went through the League season without drawing a match.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/birmingham-city/1893-1894/results |title=Birmingham City 1893<U+2013>1894 : Results |publisher=Statto Organisation |accessdate=15 April 2011}}</ref> They scored 103 goals, at a rate of 3.6 goals per game, and became the first team to exceed 100 goals in a Football League season ([[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] were the first to score exactly 100 the previous season).<ref name=FinalTable/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/LeagueTables/Season1892-93/Div11892-93.htm |title=Football League Division 1 table 1892/93 |publisher=Footballsite |accessdate=15 April 1893}}</ref> If test match goals are counted, all five first-choice forwards reached double figures for the second consecutive season.
