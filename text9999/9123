'''''Chandralekha''''' (also spelled '''''Chandraleka'''''{{efn|Although the title card of the Tamil version spells ''Chandraleka'', i.e. without the "H",<ref>''Chandralekha (Tamil) DVD''. Opening titles, at 0:33</ref> the spelling ''Chandralekha'' (with the "H") has become more common.<ref name="the hindu" /><ref name="Cecil" />}}) is a 1948 [[Indian cinema|Indian]] [[Tamil cinema|Tamil]] [[historical fiction]] film directed and produced by [[S. S. Vasan]]. Starring [[T. R. Rajakumari]], [[M. K. Radha]] and [[Ranjan (actor)|Ranjan]] in the lead roles, the film follows two brothers named Veerasimhan and Sasankan, who fight with each other over ruling their father's kingdom and for marrying the village dancer Chandralekha.

The development of ''Chandralekha'' began in the early 1940s when, after two successive box office hits, Vasan announced that his next film would be titled ''Chandralekha''. However, when he launched an advertising campaign for the film, he had only the name of the heroine from a storyline by [[Gemini Studios]]' story department he had rejected. Veppathur Kittoo, one of his storyboard artists, eventually developed a story based on a chapter of [[George W. M. Reynolds]]' novel ''Robert Macaire: or, The French bandit in England'' (1848), which impressed Vasan. The original director T. G. Raghavachari directed more than half of the film, then left the project because of disagreements with Vasan, who took over the film in his directorial debut.

Originally made in Tamil and later in [[Hindi]], ''Chandralekha'' was in production for five years from 1943 to 1948. It went through a number of changes to the script, cast and production, and ultimately became the most expensive film made in India at the time; the budget for a single sequence equalled that typical for an entire film of the period. Vasan mortgaged all of his property and even sold his jewellery to complete the film. Cinematography was by Kamal Ghosh and K. Ramnoth. The music was largely inspired by both Indian and Western classical music; it was composed by [[S. Rajeswara Rao]] and by M. D. Parthasarathy, with lyrics by [[Papanasam Sivan]] and [[Kothamangalam Subbu]].

After a massive publicity campaign, ''Chandralekha'' was released on 9 April 1948 to generally positive reviews, but was unable to recover its production costs. As a result, Vasan released the film in Hindi with some changes later the same year, and ''Chandralekha'' soon became a major box office success, as well as India's first nationwide hit. [[Cinema of South India|South Indian cinema]] gained prominence throughout the country with the film's release. The film inspired South Indian film producers to market their Hindi films in North India. It was dubbed in English, Japanese, Danish and other foreign languages and was screened at Indian and international film festivals.

==Plot==
:''Note: This plot summary refers to the original Tamil version of the film''
Veerasimhan ([[M. K. Radha]]) and Sasankan ([[Ranjan (actor)|Ranjan]]) are the sons of the king. While passing through a village on his horse, Veerasimhan meets a village dancer named Chandralekha ([[T. R. Rajakumari]]) and they fall in love. At the palace, the king decides to [[abdication|abdicate]] in favour of Veerasimhan. This enrages the younger brother Sasankan; he forms a gang of thieves who embark on a crime spree. Chandralekha's father is injured in the ensuing chaos and dies soon after. Chandralekha, now orphaned, joins a band of travelling musicians, whose caravan is raided by Sasankan's men.

Sasankan orders Chandralekha to dance for him, which she does after being flogged. She later escapes. Later, Sasankan ambushes Veerasimhan and takes him prisoner. Chandralekha watches Sasankan's men trapping Veerasimhan in a cave and sealing its entrance with a boulder. She rescues him with the help of elephants from a passing circus troupe. Veerasimhan and Chandralekha join the circus to hide themselves from Sasankan's men. After returning to the palace, Sasankan imprisons his parents and declares himself king. He immediately sends a spy to find Chandralekha.

The spy sees Chandralekha performing at the circus; he tries to capture her but Veerasimhan saves her and they both escape and join a [[Banjara|gypsy group]]. When Veerasimhan leaves to seek help, Sasankan's men capture Chandralekha and take her to the palace. Sasankan tries to woo Chandralekha but she pretends to faint every time he approaches her. One of Chandralekha's friends from the circus comes to Sasankan disguised as a gypsy healer, claiming that she can cure Chandralekha of her "illness". Behind locked doors, the two girls secretly talk. Sasankan is pleased to find Chandralekha miraculously cured and apparently ready to accept him as a bridegroom. In return, he agrees to Chandralekha's request for a drum dance to celebrate the royal wedding.

Huge drums are arranged in rows in front of the palace. Chandralekha joins the dancers, who dance on the drums. Sasankan is impressed with Chandralekha's performance but, unknown to him, Veerasimhan's soldiers are hiding inside the drums. As the dance ends, they rush out of the drums and attack Sasankan's men. Veerasimhan confronts Sasankan, and they have a long sword fight, which ends with Sasankan's defeat and imprisonment. Veerasimhan releases his parents and becomes the new king, while Chandralekha becomes his queen.

==Production==

===Development===
Producer [[S. S. Vasan]] contemplated a story for his third film to follow ''[[Mangamma Sapatham (1943 film)|Mangamma Sapatham]]'' (1943) and ''[[Bala Nagamma]]'' (1942), which netted profits of {{INRConvert|4|m|year=1944|to=USD}}. He wanted a film on a grand scale with no budgetary constraints.{{Sfn|Guy|1997|p = 245}} He asked [[Gemini Studios]]' story department (consisting of K. J. Mahadevan, [[Kothamangalam Subbu]], Sangu, Naina and Veppathur Kittoo){{Sfn|Banerjee|Srivastava|1988|p = 58}} to write a screenplay. They saw ''Mangamma Sapatham'' and ''Bala Nagamma'' as "heroine-oriented stories", and suggested a similar story to Vasan. They told the story of Chandralekha, a tough woman who "outwits a vicious bandit, delivers the final insult by slashing off his nose and, as a finishing touch, fills the bloodied gaping hole with hot, red chilli powder". Vasan disliked their story's gruesomeness and vulgarity, and rejected it but kept the character's name, Chandralekha.{{sfn|Guy|1997|p=245}}

Without waiting for the full story, Vasan announced that his next project would be titled ''Chandralekha'', and he publicised it heavily in most major publications. Despite much work by Gemini's writers, the story was still not ready three months later. Vasan grew impatient and told the writers he would be shelving ''Chandralekha'' in favour of developing ''[[Avvaiyyar]]''. After allowing the writers a final week,{{Sfn|Guy|1997|p = 245}} Kittoo discovered [[George W. M. Reynolds]]' novel ''Robert Macaire: or, The French bandit in England'' (1848). In the first chapter he read:

<center>{{quote|text=A dark night in rural England and a mail coach convoy drawn by horses trots its way down a deserted leafy highway when suddenly, Robert Macaire, the fierce bandit and his henchmen emerge from the surrounding darkness and rob the convoy. Hiding under a seat is a young woman fleeing from a harsh, unhappy home. She is a dancer and when she refuses to dance the bandit whips her into submission.<ref name="the hindu" />}}</center>

Vasan was impressed when Kittoo narrated a story based on this episode. He decided to continue with the film, naming the heroine Chandralekha. Although the story was still incomplete,<ref name="madras musings" /> the rest of Gemini's story department later improvised Kittoo's ideas to give the story its final form.{{Sfn|Dhananjayan|2011|page = 93}}

When a minor role of the hero's bodyguard was yet to be cast, the then struggling stage actor Villupuram Chinniah Pillai Ganeshamurthy{{mdash}}who later became known as [[Sivaji Ganesan]]{{mdash}}was interested; he grew his hair long for the role. Ganeshamurthy had contacted Kittoo several times asking for a role in the film. Eventually, Kittoo took Ganeshamurthy to Vasan, who had seen him perform on-stage. To Ganeshamurthy's dismay, Vasan rejected him, calling him "totally unsuited for films" and told him to choose another profession. This incident caused a permanent schism between Vasan and Ganeshamurthy.<ref name="madras musings" /> The role of the bodyguard was eventually given to N.

==Themes and influences==
Although a period film, ''Chandralekha'' is not based on historical fact;{{Sfn|Dwyer|Patel|2002|p = 144}} instead its plot is based on the first chapter of the novel ''Robert Macaire: or, The French bandit in England''. Sasankan is based on the fictional bandit [[Robert Macaire]],{{Sfn|Guy|1997|p = 246}} and Chandralekha is based on a female dancer in the novel who Macaire flogs when she refuses to dance.{{Sfn|Garga|2005|p = 118}} The film enacts the incident from the novel.<ref name="the hindu" /> According to film historian B. D. Garga, the film also shows influences from other Western literary and cinematic sources, including the novel ''[[Sangre y arena|Blood and Sand]]'' (1908), and the films ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920), ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]'' (1922), ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1924 film)|The Thief of Baghdad]]'' (1924) and ''[[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1925).{{Sfn|Garga|2005|p = 118}} In December 1964, [[Jerzy Toeplitz]] called ''Chandralekha'' an "extension and development" of the mythology genre. Toeplitz said, "The characters are mortals but behave like heavenly beings, and their movements and gestures, like those of the gods and heroes of the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' are impregnated with the miraculous". He called the story a "mere pretext to hold together the different episodes, each of which builds up like a circus turn: the tension mounts to a culminating point, whereupon the next episode immediately takes over".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001341/134149eo.pdf | title=Indian films and Western audiences | publisher=[[UNESCO]] | date=23 December 1964 | accessdate=4 August 2014 | author=[[Jerzy Toeplitz|Toeplitz, Jerry]] | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120208164919/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001341/134149eo.pdf | archivedate=8 February 2012}}</ref> According to the book ''Third World Film Making and the West'' (1987) by Roy Armes, [[Uday Shankar]]'s ''[[Kalpana (1948 film)|Kalpana]]'' (1948), which was also shot at Gemini Studios, inspired Vasan to make ''Chandralekha''.{{Sfn|Armes|1987|pp = 114<U+2013>115}} In the 2003 book ''Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema'', ''Chandralekha'' is defined as a "[[Ruritanian romance|Ruritanian]] period extravaganza".{{Sfn|Gulaz<U+0101>ra|Nihalani|Chatterjee|2003|loc = [http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8y8vN9A14nkC&pg=PT456&lpg=PT456&dq=chandralekha+ruritanian&source=bl&ots=rwWu1fwnj7&sig=P_VFZm8G71pZnQX5QGC2qYzCk0U&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ox0LUqn1HoWjkQW6oICABw&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=chandralekha%20ruritanian&f=false p. 432]}}

The climactic sword fight between Veerasimhan and Sasankan has often been compared to that in the 1894 novel ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]''.{{Sfn|Banerjee|Srivastava|1988|p = 59}}{{Sfn|Raghavendra|2009|p = 34}} In 1976, American film historian [[William K. Everson]] compared the comedians in ''Chandralekha'' to the comedy duo [[Laurel and Hardy]].<ref name="everson" /> Although G. Dhananjayan and Randor Guy consider the film's drum dance scene as the first of its kind in Indian cinema,{{Sfn|Dhananjayan|2011|p = 93}}{{Sfn|Guy|1997|p = 249}} the 1947 film ''[[Naam Iruvar]]'' includes a scene in which the lead actress' younger sister dances on drums to the Tamil poet [[Subramania Bharati]]'s song "Kottu Murase";<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.upperstall.com/people/av-meiyappan | title=AV Meiyappan | publisher=[[Upperstall.com]] | accessdate=26 July 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429224208/http://upperstall.com/people/av-meiyappan | archivedate=29 April 2014}}</ref>{{Sfn|Baskaran|1996|p = 102}} French film historian Yves Thoraval said this "prefigured the dance that ''Chandralekha'' made famous the very next year".{{Sfn|Thoraval|2000|p = 39}} According to American film critic [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]], ''Chandralekha'' "belongs to the same childhood continuum" as [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1959 films ''[[The Tiger of Eschnapur (1959 film)|The Tiger of Eschnapur]]'' and ''[[The Indian Tomb (1959 film)|The Indian Tomb]]'' which were set in India.<ref name="Rosenbaum" /> In his 2009 book '' 50 Indian Film Classics'', film critic M. K. Raghavendra states that ''Chandralekha'' is constructed in a manner that "enables its narrative to incorporate elements drawn from virtually any kind of genre".{{Sfn|Raghavendra|2009|p = 34}} According to Guy, the settings of the song "Naattiya Kuthirai" picturised on Sundari Bai's character, including the dance and the costume worn by Sundari Bai, are inspired by those seen in the 1943 musical film ''[[Coney Island (1943 film)|Coney Island]]''.<ref name="sundari bai" />

==Music==
The film's soundtrack was composed by [[S. Rajeswara Rao]],<ref name="1:43" /> with lyrics by [[Papanasam Sivan]] and Kothamangalam Subbu.<ref name="indolink" /> R. Vaidyanathan and B. Das Gupta collaborated with M. D. Parthasarathy on the background music.<ref name="1:43">''Chandralekha (Tamil) DVD''. Opening titles, at 1:43</ref> The music was influenced by [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] music, [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] music, [[Latin American music|Latin American]] and [[Portuguese folk music#Folk music|Portuguese folk music]], and [[Johann Strauss I]]'s waltzes.{{Sfn|Rajadhyaksha|Willemen|1999|p = 310}}{{Sfn|Garga|2005|p = 120}}<ref name="Bhaktavatsala"/> M. K. Raghavendra said the film has "snatches from [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky Korsakov]] (''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scherezade]]'') being used at dramatic moments".{{Sfn|Raghavendra|2009|p = 34}}

The song "Naattiya Kuthirai" was not originally part of the script; it was added during the final stages of the film's production. Sundari Bai spent over a month rehearsing the song.<ref name="sundari bai">{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/article3217609.ece | title=Charming, villainous | work=The Hindu | date=24 March 2006 | accessdate=15 August 2014 | last=Guy | first=Randor | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140815162422/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/article3217609.ece | archivedate=15 August 2014}}</ref> The songs "Indrae Enathu Kuthukalam" and "Manamohana Saaranae" were sung by T.

She was initially hesitant, feeling that "these were beyond her capabilities", but she was supported by Rajeswara Rao who "worked hard on her".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20031207/spectrum/main6.htm | title=Hindi cinema's first-ever comedienne | work=[[Tribune India]] | date=7 December 2003 | accessdate=24 July 2014 | last=Kaur | first=Devinder Bir | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901001054/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20031207/spectrum/main6.htm | archivedate=1 September 2013}}</ref> The music of ''Chandralekha'' helped it to become one of the most successful Indian musical films of the 1940s;{{Sfn|Vijayakar|2009|p = 16}} it "created an atmosphere for a number of music directors influenced by Western music" in Tamil cinema.<ref name="religion">{{cite book | url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rQoqAAAAYAAJ&q=chandraleka+donkey+serenade&dq=chandraleka+donkey+serenade&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9r_bUdOQCsqOrgedooDwDw&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ | title=Religion and Society, Volume 12 | publisher=Christian Institute for the Study of Religion and Society | year=1965 | page=103}}</ref>

In his 1997 book ''Starlight, Starbright: The Early Tamil Cinema'', Randor Guy said Partha<U+00AD>sarathy and Rajeswara Rao "created a fine blend of lilting music of many schools".{{Sfn|Guy|1997|p = 250}} Writing for ''[[Screen (magazine)|Screen]]'' in April 1998, film historian M. Bhaktavatsala called the songs as "distinct and standing on its own, with barely any background score attempting to interlink anything, just periods of silence".<ref name="Bhaktavatsala">{{cite journal | title=Music in the Movies | date=24 April 1998 | author=Bhaktavatsala, M. | journal=[[Screen (magazine)|Screen]] | page=p. 36}}</ref>

====India====
[[File:Chandralekha drum dance scene.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|alt=Several women dancing on giant drums.|The drum dance scene is often considered the highlight of the film by critics.]]
''Chandralekha'' received generally positive reviews from Indian critics. On 9 April 1948, ''The Hindu'' said, "India has not witnessed a film of this magnitude in terms of making and settings so far".{{Sfn|Dhananjayan|2011|page = 94}} On 10 April, ''[[The Indian Express]]'' said, "''Chandralekha'' is an entertaining film for everyone with elements like animals, rope dance, circus and comedy".{{Sfn|Dhananjayan|2011|page = 94}} The same day, the Tamil newspaper ''[[Dinamani]]'' said, "''Chandralekha'' is not only a first rate Tamil film but also an international film".{{Sfn|Dhananjayan|2011|page = 94}}

[[V. A. K. Ranga Rao]] described the film as "the most complete entertainer ever made".{{efn|The comment by Ranga Rao appears in Randor Guy's 1997 book ''Starlight, Starbright: The Early Tamil Cinema''. The year of the comment is not mentioned.{{Sfn|Guy|1997|p=244}}}} In their 1988 book ''One Hundred Indian Feature Films: An Annotated Filmography'', Anil Srivastava and Shampa Banerjee praised nearly every aspect of the film, including its grandeur, the battle scenes and the drum dance, which they called the "''raison d'etre''" of the film.{{Sfn|Banerjee|Srivastava|1988|p = 59}} In 2003, journalist S.

In May 2010, Raja Sen of [[Rediff.com]] praised the film's "grandly mounted setpieces", its "memorable drum dance" and the "longest swordfight ever captured on film", calling ''Chandralekha'' "just the kind of film, in fact, that would be best appreciated now after digital restoration".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-classics-to-be-restored/20100511.htm#4 | title=Ten Indian classics craving digital restoration | publisher=[[Rediff.com]] | date=11 May 2010 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | last=Sen | first=Raja | page=4 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008014445/http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-classics-to-be-restored/20100511.htm | archivedate=10 November 2013}}</ref> In an October 2010 review of ''Chandralekha'', Randor Guy praised Rajakumari's performance, calling it "her career-best" and saying that she "carried the movie on her shoulders".
