'''Reba Nell McEntire''' (born March 28, 1955) is a [[Grammy award]]-winning American [[country music|country]] music artist. She began her career in the [[Music of the United States|music industry]] singing with her siblings on local radio shows and rodeos. As a solo act, she was invited to perform at a rodeo in [[Oklahoma City]], which caught the attention of country artist [[Red Steagall]]. He brought her to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where she eventually signed a contract with [[Mercury Records]] in 1975. She released her first solo album in 1977 and released five additional studio albums under the label until 1983. 

Signing with [[MCA Nashville Records]], McEntire took creative control over her second MCA album, ''[[My Kind of Country]]'' (1984), which had a more traditional country sound and produced two number one singles: "[[How Blue]]" and "[[Somebody Should Leave]]". The album brought her breakthrough success, bringing her a series of successful albums and number one singles in the 1980s and 1990s. McEntire has since released 25 studio albums, acquired  22 #1 singles, and 28 albums have been certified Gold, Platinum or Multi-Platinum in sales by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].

In the early 1990s, McEntire branched into film starting with 1990's ''[[Tremors (film)|Tremors]].'' She has since starred in the [[Broadway Theatre|Broadway]] revival of ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'' and starred in her television sitcom, ''[[Reba (TV series)|Reba]]'' (2001 - 2007) for which she was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Musical or Comedy .<ref name="allmusicbio">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:hifwxql5ldde~T1|title=Reba McEntire > Biography|last=Rulmann|first=William|publisher=[[allmusic]]|accessdate=2009-08-23}}</ref> She has sometimes been referred to as "The Queen of Country",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/women/singer_250/295_reba_mcentire.html|title=Reba McEntire  Ask Men|publisher=''[[Ask Men]]''|accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,1195667_4%7C27538%7C%7C0_0_,00.html|title=Reba McEntire|publisher=''EW.com''|accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> having sold 41-million records in the United States and 50-million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5729018,00.html|title=News : Headlines : Reba McEntire's Duets Album Goes Platinum : Great American Country|publisher=''[[Great American Country|GACTV.com]]''|accessdate=2009-08-25}}</ref> In the United States, she ranks as the seventh best-selling female artist in all genres and is the second best-selling female country artist of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTopArt|title=''Top Selling Artists''|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=2009-08-25}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Reba Nell McEntire was born on March 28, 1955, outside of [[Kiowa, Oklahoma]] to Jacqueline Smith and Clark Vincent McEntire.<ref name="allmusicbio"/> Her father and grandfather were champion [[steer roping|steer ropers]] and her father was a World Champion Steer Roper three times (1957, 1958, and 1961). Her mother originally had plans to become a country music artist but decided not to pursue that professionally and worked as a  [[schoolteacher]]. Instead, McEntire's mother taught her children how to sing.<ref name="musicianguide">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003357/Reba-McEntire.html|title=Reba McEntire Biography|last=Rubiner Zinn|first=Megan |publisher=Musician Guide.com|accessdate=2009-08-23}}</ref> On car rides home from her father's rodeo trips, the McEntire siblings were taught songs and learned their own [[Harmony vocal|harmonies]], eventually forming a vocal group called the "Singing McEntires". Consisting of her brother, [[Pake McEntire|Pake]], and her younger sister, [[Susie Luchsinger|Susie]] (her older sister, Alice did not participate), the group sang at rodeos and recorded a song together titled "The Ballad of John McEntire". Released on an [[Indie (music)|Indie]] label, Boss, the song pressed one thousand copies.<ref name="allmusicbio"/> In 1974, McEntire attended [[Southeastern Oklahoma State University]] and intended on becoming an [[elementary education|elementary school teacher]] (eventually graduating December 16, 1976<ref name="allmusicbio"/>). While not attending school, she also continued to sing locally.<ref name="musicianguide"/> That same year she was also invited to perform [[The Star-Spangled Banner|the national anthem]] at an [[Oklahoma City]] rodeo. At the rodeo, country artist [[Red Steagall]] (who was also performing that day) was impressed by her vocal ability and offered his help in making McEntire a country artist in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. After recording a demo tape, she eventually signed a recording contract with [[Mercury Records]] in 1975.<ref name="roughguide">{{cite book|last=Wolff|first=Kurt|title=''Country Music: The Rough Guide''|editor=Orla Duane|publisher=Rough Guides Ltd.|location=London, England|chapter=Ch. 12 - Wild and Blue: Traditionalism Makes a Comeback}}</ref>

== Music career ==
=== 1976 <U+2013> 1983: Career launch at Mercury ===
McEntire made her first recordings for Mercury January 22, 1976, when she cut her debut [[single (music)|single]]. Upon its release that year, "I Don't Want to Be a One Night Stand" failed to become a major hit on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' country music chart]], peaking at #88 in May.<ref name="whitburncharts">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|date=2008|pages=270-271|isbn=0-89820-177-2|accessdate=2009-10-06}}</ref> She completed her second recording session September 16, which included the production of her second single, "(There's Nothing Like The Love) Between a Woman and Man", which only reached #86 in March 1977. She recorded a third single that April titled "Glad I Just Waited for You", which reached #88 by August. That same month, Mercury issued her [[Reba McEntire (album)|self-titled debut album]].<ref name="allmusicbio"/> The album was a departure from any of McEntire's future releases, as it resembled the material of [[Tanya Tucker]] and [[Tammy Wynette]], according to ''[[Allmusic]]'' reviewer Greg Adams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:kjftxqw5ldhe|title=''Reba McEntire'' > Overview|last=Adams|first=Greg|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2009-08-24}}</ref> The album itself did not chart the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart upon its release.<ref name="allmusicbio"/><ref name="roughguide"/> After releasing two singles with [[Jacky Ward]] ("Three Sheets in the Wind"/"[[I'd Really Love to See You Tonight]]" and "That Makes Two of Us" at #20 and #26, respectively<ref name="whitburncharts"/>), Mercury issued her second studio album in 1979, ''[[Out of a Dream (Reba McEntire album)|Out of a Dream]].'' The album's cover of [[Patsy Cline]]'s "[[Sweet Dreams (Don Gibson song)|Sweet Dreams]]" became McEntire's first Top 20 hit, reaching #19 on the ''Billboard'' country chart in November 1979.<ref name="allmusicbio"/><ref name="whitburncharts"/>

In 1980, "You Lift Me Up (To Heaven)" brought her to the Top 10 for the first time.<ref name="askmen">{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/women/singer_250/295_reba_mcentire.html|title=Reba McEntire Bio - AskMen.com|publisher=''[[Ask Men]]''|accessdate=2009-08-24}}</ref> Her third studio album, ''[[Feel the Fire (Reba McEntire album)|Feel the Fire]]'' was released in October and spawned two additional Top 20 hit singles that year.<ref name="allmusicbio"/> In September 1982, McEntire's fourth album, ''[[Heart to Heart]]'' was issued and became her first album to chart the ''Billboard'' Top Country Albums list, peaking at #42. Its lead single, "Today All Over Again" became a Top 5 country hit and the second single, "I'm Not That Lonely Yet" became her biggest hit up to that point, peaking at #3.<ref name="allmusicbio"/> The album received mainly negative reviews from critics. William Ruhlmann of ''[[Allmusic]]'' gave it two-and-a-half out of five stars, stating she did not get creative control of her music. Ruhlmann called "There Ain't No Love" "essentially a soft pop ballad".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:anfuxq8gld0e|title=''Heart to Heart'' > Overview|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2009-08-24}}</ref> Most of the album's material consisted of mainly [[country pop]]-styled ballads, which was not well-liked by McEntire herself.<ref name="roughguide"/> Her fifth album, ''[[Unlimited (Reba McEntire album)|Unlimited]]'' was issued in June 1982 and spawned her first ''Billboard'' Number One singles in early 1983: "Can't Even Get the Blues" and "You're the First Time I've Thought About Leaving".<ref name="whitburncharts"/> The following year her sixth album, ''[[Behind the Scene]]'' was released and was positively-received by music critics.<ref name="musicianguide"/> In 1983, McEntire announced her departure from Mercury, criticizing the label's [[country pop]] production styles.<ref name="allmusicbio"/>

=== 1984 <U+2013> 1990: Breakthrough success ===
McEntire signed with [[MCA Nashville Records]] in 1984 and released her seventh studio album, entitled ''[[Just a Little Love]].'' [[Harold Shedd]] was originally the album's producer; however, McEntire rejected his suggestions towards [[country pop]] arrangements. It was instead produced by [[Norro Wilson]], although the album still had a distinguishable country pop sound.<ref name="roughguide"/> Dissatisfied with the album's sound, she went to MCA president, [[Jimmy Bowen]], who told McEntire to find material that was best-suited to her liking. Instead of finding new material, she found previously-recorded country hits from her own record collection, which was then recorded for the album. The album's material included songs originally released as singles by [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]] ("Don't You Believe Her", "I Want to Hear It from You"), [[Carl Smith]] ("Before I Met You"), [[Faron Young]] ("He's Only Everything") and [[Connie Smith]] ("You've Got Me [Right Where You Want Me"]).<ref name="1984album">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:hjfyxqw5ldhe|title=''My Kind of Country'' > Overview|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2009-08-24}}</ref> The album spawned two number one singles: "[[How Blue]]" and "[[Somebody Should Leave]]". It was given positive reviews from critics, with ''[[Billboard Magazine]]'' praising McEntire as "the finest woman country singer since [[Kitty Wells]]" and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' critics honoring her as one of their Top 5 favorite country artists.<ref name="musicianguide"/> Upon its release, ''My Kind of Country'' became her highest-peaking album on the [[Top Country Albums]] chart, reaching #13. The album also included instruments such as a [[fiddle]] and [[pedal steel guitar]], and was aimed more towards a traditional country sound. McEntire was later praised as a "new traditionalist", along with [[Ricky Skaggs]] and [[George Strait]]. That year, she won the [[Country Music Association Awards]]' Female Vocalist of the Year, her first major industry award.<ref name="allmusicbio"/><ref name="1984album"/> 

In 1985, McEntire released her third MCA album, ''[[Have I Got a Deal for You]],'' which followed the same traditional format as ''My Kind of Country.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:djfyxqw5ldhe|title=''Have I Got a Deal for You'' > Overview|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2009-08-24}}</ref> It was the first album produced by McEntire and was co-produced with [[Jimmy Bowen]]. Like her previous release, the album received positive feedback, including ''Rolling Stone'', which called it a "promising debut". The album's second single, "[[Only in My Mind]]" was entirely written by McEntire and reached #5 on the ''Billboard'' country chart.<ref name="musicianguide"/> On January 17, 1986, McEntire became a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] show in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and has been a member ever since.<ref name="opry">{{cite web|url=http://opry.com/MeetTheOpry/Members.aspx?id=88|title=Opry Member: Reba McEntire|publisher=''opry.com''|accessdate=2009-08-24}}</ref> In February 1986, McEntire's ninth studio album, ''[[Whoever's in New England]]'' was released. For this album, McEntire and co-producer Jimmy Bowen incorporated her traditional music style into a mainstream sound that was entirely different than anything she had previously recorded. ''Country Music: The Rough Guide'' called the production of the [[Whoever's in New England (song)|title track]], "bigger and sentimentalism more obvious, even manipulative".<ref name="roughguide"/> The title track peaked at #1 on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Country Chart]] and won her a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] the following year.<ref name="whitburncharts"/> In addition, the album became McEntire's first release to certify gold in sales by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (and was later certified Platinum). At the end of the year, McEntire won Entertainer of the Year from the Country Music Association, the highest honor in the awards show.<ref name="roughguide"/>

McEntire released a second album in 1986, ''[[What Am I Gonna Do About You]].'' Allmusic critic William Ruhlmann was not overly pleased with album's production, saying that it lacked the features that had been set forth on ''[[Whoever's in New England]].'' Rulhlmann criticized the title track for "something of the feel of 'Whoever's in New England' in its portrayal of a woman trying to recover from a painfully ended love affair".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:0jfyxqw5ldhe|title=''What Am I Gonna Do About You'' > Overview|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2009-08-24}}</ref> The [[What Am I Gonna Do About You (song)|title track]] was the lead single from the release and was a number one single shortly after its release.<ref name="whitburncharts"/> This album also spawned a second Number One in "One Promise Too Late". The following year, her first MCA compilation, ''[[Greatest Hits (Reba McEntire album)|Greatest Hits]]'' was released and became her first album to be certified platinum in sales, eventually certifying triple-platinum.<ref name="allmusicbio"/> A twelfth studio album was released in 1987, titled ''[[The Last One to Know]].'' The emotions of her divorce from husband, Charlie Battles, were put into the album's material, according to McEntire. The title track from the release was a number one single in 1987 and the second single, "Love Will Find Its Way to You", also reached the top spot. <ref name="musicianguide"/> In late 1987, McEntire released her first Christmas collection, ''[[Merry Christmas to You]],'' which sold two million copies in the United States, certifying double Platinum.<ref name="askmen"/> The album included cover versions of "[[Away in a Manger]]", "[[Silent Night]]", and [[Grandpa Jones]]'s "The Christmas Guest".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:fzfwxqwgldhe|title=''Merry Christmas to You'' > Overview|last=Bush|first=John|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2009-08-25}}</ref>

Her thirteenth album, ''[[Reba (album)|Reba]]'', was issued in 1988 and was not well-received by critics, who claimed she was moving farther away from her "traditional country" sound. ''[[Stereo Review]]'' disliked the album's contemporary style, stating, "After years of insisting that she'd stick to hard-core country 'because I have tried the contemporary-type songs, and it's not Reba McEntire<U+2014>it's just not honest,' McEntire[...]has gone whole-hog pop. Okay, so maybe that's not so terrible. But her rendition of the soul classic '[[Respect (song)|Respect]]' is."<ref name="musicianguide"/> Although it was reviewed poorly, the album itself was certified platinum in sales and produced two number one singles: "I Know How He Feels" and "New Fool at an Old Game".<ref name="whitburncharts"/> In addition, the release's cover version of [[Jo Stafford]]'s "[[A Sunday Kind of Love]]" became a Top 5 hit on the ''Billboard'' country music chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:hjftxqw5ldhe|title=''Reba'' > Overview|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2009-08-25}}</ref> Also in 1988, McEntire founded [[Starstruck Entertainment]], which controlled her management, booking, publishing, promotion, publicity, accounting, ticket sales, and fan club administration. The company would eventually expand into managing a horse farm, jet charter service, trucking, construction, and book publishing.<ref name="musicianguide"/>

McEntire's fourteenth studio album was released in May 1989; entitled ''[[Sweet Sixteen (Reba McEntire album)|Sweet Sixteen]],'' it spent thirteen weeks at number one on the [[Top Country Albums|''Billboard'' Top Country Albums]] chart, while also becoming her first album to peak in the top 100 on the [[Billboard 200]], reaching #78. The album was given positive reviews because unlike her previous studio album, the release, "welcomes the fiddles and steel guitars back as she returns to the neo-traditionalist fold", according to Allmusic, which gave the release four-and-a-half out of five stars. Reviewer William Ruhlmann found ''Sweet Sixteen'' to "double back to a formula that worked for her in the past". The lead single was a cover of [[The Everly Brothers]]' "[[Cathy's Clown]]", with McEntire's version reaching #1 in July on the ''Billboard'' country music chart. Three more Top 10 hits followed from ''Sweet Sixteen'': "Till Love Comes Again", "Little Girl", and "Walk On", at #4, #7 and #2 respectively.<ref name="whitburncharts"/> In September she released ''[[Reba Live]],'' her first live album, which originally certified gold but certified platinum ten years later.<ref name="sweetsixteen">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:wjftxqw5ldhe|title=''Sweet Sixteen'' > Overview|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2009-08-25}}</ref><ref name="allmusicbio"/>

Sixteen months after the release of ''Sweet Sixteen'' and after giving birth to a child, McEntire transitioned into 1990 with the release of ''[[Rumor Has It (Reba McEntire album)|Rumor Has It]].'' The album's "sound and production were almost entirely pop-oriented", according to Kurt Wolff of ''Country Music: The Rough Guide.''<ref name="roughguide"/> Although ''Rumor Has It'' was an attempt to receive critical praise, many reviewers found the album to be "predictable". ''[[Stereo Review]]'' mainly found the recording displeasing in some places, but the reviewer also believed she "still leaves most of the competition in the dust", calling the album "glorious". ''Rumor Has It'' eventually sold three million copies by 1999, certifying triple-platinum by that year.<ref name="musicianguide"/> It was prefaced by the single "You Lie", which became her fifteenth number one single on the country chart.<ref name="whitburncharts"/> In addition, the album's cover of [[Bobbie Gentry]]'s 1969 hit "[[Fancy (song)|Fancy]]" and a new track, "Fallin' Out of Love", became Top 10 hits on the same ''Billboard'' country chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:ajftxqw5ldhe|title=''Rumor Has It'' > Overview|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2009-08-25}}</ref>

=== 1991: Aviation accident and ''For My Broken Heart'' ===
While on tour for her 1990 album, McEntire lost eight members of her road band and two plane crewman ([[Chris Austin (singer)|Chris Austin]], Kirk Cappello, Joey Cigainero, Paula Kaye Evans, Terry Jackson, Michael Thomas, Tony Saputo) when their charter jet plane crashed near [[San Diego, California]] on March 16, 1991. The accident occurred after McEntire's private performance for [[IBM]] executives the night before.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaydeebee1.com/crash90s.html|title=1990s: Notable California Aviation Disasters|publisher=jay dee bee 1.com|accessdate=2009-08-25}}</ref> The first plane was a [[Hawker Siddeley]] charter jet had believed to have taken off around 1:45 AM from the [[Brown Field Municipal Airport]], located near the border of [[Mexico]]. After rising about 3,572 feet in the air, the Hawker aircraft crashed on the side of Otay Mountain, located ten miles east of the airport, while the second plane (carrying her other band members) did not crash. The accident was believed to have occurred due to poor visibility near Otay Mountain, which was not considered "prohibitive" for flying. The news was reported nearly immediately to McEntire and her husband, who were sleeping at a nearby hotel. A spokeswoman for McEntire at the time stated in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that "she was very close to all of them. Some of them had been with her for years. Reba is totally devastated by this. It's like losing part of your family. Right now she just wants to get back to Nashville."<ref name="latimes">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-03-17/news/mn-698_1_band-member|title=8 Country Band Members Die in S.D.

McEntire dedicated her sixteenth album, ''[[For My Broken Heart]]'', to her deceased road band. Released in October 1991, it contained songs of sorrow and lost love about "all measure of suffering",<ref name=ew/> according to [[Alanna Nash]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]].'' Nash reported that McEntire "still hits her stride with the more traditional songs of emotional turmoil, above all combining a spectacular vocal performance with a terrific song on "Buying Her Roses", a wife's head- spinning discovery of her husband's other woman".<ref name=ew>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,315822,00.html|title=''For My Broken Heart'' | Music Review|last=Nash|first=Alanna|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|accessdate=2009-08-25}}</ref> Within nine months, ''For My Broken Heart'' sold two million copies and McEntire was soon responsible for the highest album sales by any recording artist on the [[MCA Nashville]] record label.<ref name="musicianguide"/> The release peaked at #1 on the [[Top Country Albums|''Billboard'' Top Country Albums]] chart, while also reaching #13 on the [[Billboard 200]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:3jfuxqw5ldhe~T3|title=''For My Broken Heart'' > Album charts|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2009-08-25}}</ref> selling an eventual total of four million copies in the United States, thus earning a quadruple-platium certification. Its [[For My Broken Heart (song)|title track]] became McEntire's sixteenth number one, followed by "[[Is There Life Out There]]", which also reached #1 on the ''Billboard'' country music chart.<ref name="allmusicbio"/> The third single, "The Greatest Man I Never Knew" peaked in the Top 5 and her cover of [[Vicki Lawrence]]'s "[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]" reached #12.<ref name="whitburncharts"/>

=== 1992 <U+2013> 1996: Continued success ===
In December 1992, McEntire's seventeenth studio album, ''[[It's Your Call]]'', was released. It became her first album to peak within the [[Billboard 200]] Top 10, reaching #8.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:3pfixqwgldae~T3|title=''It's Your Call'' > album charts|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2009-08-25}}</ref> McEntire commented that the record was a "second chapter" to ''For My Broken Heart'',<ref name="liner">{{cite album-notes |title=It's Your Call |bandname=Reba McEntire |year=1992 |format=CD booklet |publisher=MCA Records |publisherid=MCAD-10673}}</ref> while music reviewers such as [[Alanna Nash]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' disagreed, writing, "In truth, it isn't nearly as pessimistic as its predecessor <U+2014> and unfortunately it isn't anywhere as involving." Nash called the album's title track<U+2014>which peaked at #5 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] chart<U+2014>"one of those moment-of-truth sagas at which McEntire excels. In the song, a wife answers the phone to find her husband's girlfriend on the other end and seizes the opportunity not only to inform her mate that she knows of his affair but to give him the ultimatum of choosing between the two.

On April 5, 2009, McEntire debuted her first single on Valory at the 2009 Academy of Country Music Awards, entitled "[[Strange (Reba McEntire song)|Strange]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/reviews-singles/strange-1003961166.story|title=Single Review, Strange|last=Evans Price|first=Deborah|work=Billboard|accessdate=2009-04-13}}</ref> The song debuted at #39 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, giving McEntire the highest single debut of her career,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/superstar-rebas-strange-makes-highest-solo-chart-debut-of-career,785182.shtml |title=SUPERSTAR REBA'S "STRANGE" MAKES HIGHEST SOLO CHART DEBUT OF CAREER  |date=2009-04-13|work=PR Newswire|accessdate=2009-04-13}}</ref> and went on to peak at #11. Her twenty-sixth studio album, ''[[Keep on Loving You (album)|Keep On Loving You]]'' was released August 18, 2009 and became McEntire's first solo studio album in six years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countryblips.dailyradar.com/story/with_new_album_release_approaching_reba_mcentire_will/|title= With new album release approaching, Reba McEntire will be everywhere|publisher=''[[Examiner.com]]''/Country Blips|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref> The album gained fairly positive reviews from most album critics, including Jim Malec of The 9513, which gave ''Keep on Loving You'' three and a half out of five stars. Malec favored "Strange", calling McEntire's performance of the song "stellar". Criticism was given to the album's third track, "I Want a Cowboy", characterizing the song as an "annoying stop-and-go melody and lyrics more befitting a 17 year old [[Lila McCann]], it is a song so generic and irrelevant that it would be album filler on the worst albums".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the9513.com/album-review-reba-mcentire-keep-on-loving-you/|title=Album review: ''Keep on Loving You''|last=Malec|first=Jim|publisher=''The 9513''|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref> On August 26, ''Keep on Loving You'' became McEntire's second album to top both the ''Billboard'' Country and 200 charts, selling 96,000 copies within its first week. With the album, McEntire broke the record for the female country artist with the most ''Billboard'' #1 albums, which was previously held by [[Loretta Lynn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicrow.com/2009/08/rebas-record-setting-album-enters-at-no-1/|title=Reba<U+2019>s Record Setting Album Enters At No. 1|last=Skates|first=Sarah|date=2008-08-26|publisher=''Music Row''|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref> On August 18, the label released the album's second single, "[[Consider Me Gone]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrymusicstop.com/reba-mcentire-releasing-consider-me-gone/|title=Reba McEntire releasing "Consider Me Gone"|first=Heather|date=2008-07-28|publisher=''Country Music Stop''|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref>

== Acting career ==
=== 1990 <U+2013> 1999: Entrance into film and television ===
During the late 1980s, many of McEntire's [[music videos]] were being described as "mini movies". In each video, she would portray a different character, which distinguished her music videos from other videos released by artists during that time. In the late 1980s, McEntire became interested in an acting career, eventually hiring an agent. In 1989, she co-hosted ''[[Good Morning America]]'' on the [[ABC network]].<ref name="musicianguide"/>

In 1990, she obtained her first film role playing Heather Grummer in the horror comedy ''[[Tremors (film)|Tremors]],''<ref name="musicianguide"/> along with [[Kevin Bacon]]. The film explained the story of a small group of people living in Nevada who were fighting subterranean worm-like creatures. After the film's release, McEntire developed a strong interest in acting and made it her second career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmovie.com/work/tremors-50929|title=''Tremors''|last=Eder|first=Bruce|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref><ref name="allmovie">{{cite web|url=http://allmovie.com/artist/reba-mcentire-102083/bio|title=Reba McEntire > Biography [Allmovie]|last=Albertson|first=Cammila|publisher=''[[Allmovie]]''|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref> The following year, she starred along with [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[Burt Reynolds]] in the [[made-for-television]] movie, ''[[The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw]].'' In 1994, McEntire worked with director, [[Rob Reiner]] in the film, ''[[North (film)|North]],'' playing Ma Tex.<ref name="musicianguide"/> The film obtained negative reviews, receiving only two in a half stars from ''[[Allmovie]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmovie.com/work/north-131233/review|title=''North'' > Review|last=Armstrong|first=Derek|publisher=''allmovie''|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref> In 1995, McEntire starred in a third made-for-television movie entitled, ''[[Buffalo Girls]],'' which was based upon the life of western cowgirl, [[Calamity Jane]] (played by [[Angelica Houston]]). Playing Jane's friend, [[Annie Oakley]], ''Buffalo Girls'' was nominated for an [[Emmy award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmovie.com/work/buffalo-girls-160412|title=''Buffalo Girls''|last=McCallion|first=Bernadette |publisher=''Allmovie''|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref> In the mid 90s, McEntire auditioned and won the portrayal of [[Molly Brown]] for the making of the film, ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]].'' However, production for the film was extended beyond its original duration, and therefore McEntire had to resign from the part, as she had already scheduled prior concert engagements. The role was instead given to [[Kathy Bates]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/mi/peachypenguin/tidbits.html|title=Titanic Tidbits: Little known facts about the movie and the actors|publisher=''Angel Fire''|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref>  In 1998, she starred as Lizzie Brooks in a fourth TV film, ''[[Forever Love (film)|Forever Love]],'' which was based upon McEntire's hit single of the same name.

=== 2000 <U+2013> 2007: Broadway and television series ===
In early 2001, McEntire expanded into theater, starring in the [[Broadway musical|Broadway]] revival of ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]].'' Playing [[Annie Oakley]] (whom she previously portrayed in ''Buffalo Girls''), McEntire's performance was critically acclaimed by several newspapers, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', which commented, "Without qualification the best performance by an actress in a musical comedy this season."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutely.net/Reba_McEntire/bio.htm|title=Reba McEntire biography (originally sourced from about.com)|publisher=''absoulutley.net''|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref> McEntire personally called the musical, "some of the hardest work I've ever done in in my life".<ref name="cmtvideo"/> 

In October 2001, McEntire premiered her half-hour television sitcom on the [[The WB Television Network|WB network]] entitled, ''[[Reba (TV series)|Reba]].'' The show was based around single mother, Reba Hart, who learns how to handle life situations after her husband divorces her and their teenage daughter becomes pregnant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/reba-mcentire/person/10375/biography.html|title=Reba: TV.com|publisher=''[[TV.com]]''|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref> ''Reba'' garnered critical acclaim and success, becoming the network's highest-rated television show for adults ranging from the ages of eighteen to forty nine.<ref name="musicianguide"/> The show would run for six seasons and nominate McEntire for a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe award]].<ref name="allmovie"/> In 2006, the series was moved to the [[The CW Television Network|CW network]] and remained there for one more season before its cancellation on February 18, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/articles/reba-is-the-cw-sitcom-cancelled-for-sure/|title=Reba: Is the CW Sitcom Cancelled for Sure?|date=2007-01-24|publisher=''TV series Finale.com''|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref> On August 16, 2009, McEntire confirmed that she is developing a new sitcom, however it is in the "very rough stages" at this point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gNkvzX691F28wHiJi1SbzXPUdJUw|title=Reba McEntire talks about her 25th album, new sitcom and love of Canada|publisher=''Google News''|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref>

== Musical styles and legacy ==
[[File:RebaStage.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Reba McEntire in concert on August 8, 2008.]]
McEntire's sound has been influenced the country music of [[Bob Wills]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Barbara Mandrell]], and [[Patsy Cline]].<ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Alanna|title=''Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Country Music in America''|publisher=DK Publishing, Inc|location=New York, NY, USA|pages=pg. 316|chapter=Ch. 11 - Tell Me 'Bout the Good Old Days}}</ref> In college, McEntire would sneak into local dances at the [[Oklahoma]]-[[Texas]] border so she could dance to Wills's music, commenting that, "it didn't get any better than dancing to Bob Wills music". She also explained Merle Haggard's influence on her career, stating "I had every album he ever put out", and would sing "every song he did", along with her brother, Pake and sister, Susie. In addition, her first major hit, "[[Sweet Dreams (Don Gibson song)|Sweet Dreams]]" was a remake of Patsy Cline's version of the song, according to McEntire herself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kovideo.net/lyrics/r/Reba-Mcentire/San-Antonio-Rose.html|title="San Antionio Rose" lyrics (including citing McEntire's musical influces, beneath lyrics)|publisher=''Kovideo.net''|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref> McEntire's music has been described to not only be built upon traditional country music, but also expand into the genres of [[Country pop]], [[Pop music|Mainstream pop]], [[Soul music|Soul]], [[Adult Contemporary]], and [[Rhythm and Blues|R&B]]. At times, her music has often been criticized for moving away from traditional country music. Many music critics have often called her music to be "melodramatic", "formulaic", and "bombastic", particularly after her 1988 album, ''[[Reba (album)|Reba]].'' Studio releases such as ''[[Sweet Sixteen (Reba McEntire album)|Sweet Sixteen]],'' ''[[Rumor Has It (Reba McEntire album)|Rumor Has It]],'' ''[[It's Your Call]],'' and ''[[Starting Over (Reba McEntire album)|Starting Over]]'' have often been described by these terms.<ref name="musicianguide"/><ref name="roughguide"/>

McEntire possesses a [[contralto]] vocal range<ref name="blog">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_music_blog/2007/09/larger-than-lif.html|title=Larger than life Reba breaks in UCF Arena, both get high marks|last=Brunson|first=Rick|date=2007-09-09|publisher=''[[Orlando Sentinel]]''|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref> and performs "vocal gymnastics" with her voice,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mykindofcountry.wordpress.com/2009/08/12/album-review-reba-mcentire-reba/|title=Album review: ''Reba'' (1988)|last=Morrow|first=Megan|publisher=''My Kind of Country''|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref> a musical technique in which a singer twirls a [[note]] around, using their [[vibrato]]. McEntire has often credited Dolly Parton for influencing this trait, stating that she would always listen to Parton's records and find her style of vocal gymnastics, "so pretty".<ref name="cmtvideo">Interview with Reba McEntire for ''CMT Inside Fame'' on Country Music Television. Retrieved August 26, 2009.</ref>

McEntire has often been regarded as one of country music's most influential female vocalists and most well-loved entertainers.<ref name="roughguide"/><ref name="book"/> She has also been highly-credited for remaining one of country's most popular female artists for over two decades, maintaining her success by continually incorporating contemporary musical sounds without changing her traditional vocal style.<ref name="countryuniverse"/><ref name="book"/> For many new artists, she has been credited as the inspiration to their careers in country music, including, [[Faith Hill]], [[Martina McBride]], [[Trisha Yearwood]], and [[LeAnn Rimes]].<ref name="book"/> ''The Net Music Countdown'' second handedly reported, "That influence has manifested itself in many ways. As a role model, she's shown others how to handle fame with grace and good humor while never backing down from her values or goals. Just as importantly, she's shown others to refuse to accept limitations on what she can do or how much she can achieve." McEntire also explained to the online website, "Whatever I'm doing, I feel like I'm representing country music". "It's always been my main career, and it's where my loyalties lie. I feel like I'm waving the flag of country music wherever I go, and I couldn't be prouder to do it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netmusiccountdown.com/inc/artist.php?artist=Reba+McEntire|title=Reba McEntire (originally sourced from her official website)|publisher=The Net Music Countdown|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
McEntire's two siblings (both from the Singing McEntires) have also maintained careers in the music industry. Her brother, [[Pake McEntire]] was a successful country artist in the late 1980s and early 90s. Her sister, [[Susie Luchsinger]], is a successful [[Christian music|Christian]] music singer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mylifetime.com/lifestyle/entertainment/celebrities/many-sides-reba-mcentire|title=The Many Sides of Reba McEntire|last=Hay|first=Carla|publisher=''Lifetime.com''|accessdate=2009-09-01}}</ref>

In 1976, McEntire married national [[steer roping|steer wrestling]] champion and rancher, Charlie Battles. Together, the couple owned a ranch in Oklahoma  and managed her career. In 1987, McEntire divorced Battles and moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. She later commented to Bob Allen of ''Country Music'' about their separation, saying, "I had to pack everything in one day and leave. I was totally starting over."<ref name="musicianguide"/> McEntire later claimed that she wanted to focus more on her music career, while Battles insisted that she would remain at home helping to take care of the ranch. McEntire stated, "I wasn't the little girl anymore, taking orders, and doing what he said." In 1989, McEntire married her manager and former [[steel guitar]] player, Narvel Blackstock. The couple wed in a private ceremony on a boat in [[Lake Tahoe]]. Together, the pair took over all aspects of McEntire's career, forming [[Starstruck Entertainment]], which was originally designed to help manage her career. From her second marriage, McEntire inherited three stepchildren and gave birth to a son, Shelby on February 23, 1990.<ref name="cmtvideo"/> The couple has since celebrated their twentieth wedding anniversary, and McEntire states that the secrets to her marriage are "Respect, faith, love, trust, and lots of patience".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theboot.com/2009/08/19/reba-mcentire-keeps-on-loving-gay-fans-too/|title=Reba McEntire Keeps on Loving Gay Fans, Too|last=Betts|first=Stephen L.|date=2009-08-19|publisher=''The Boot''|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref>
