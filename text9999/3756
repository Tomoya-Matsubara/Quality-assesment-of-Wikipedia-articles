"'''Va Va Voom'''" is a song recorded by American recording artist [[Nicki Minaj]] from the deluxe version of her second studio album ''[[Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded]]''. It was released on October 23, 2012 by [[Young Money Entertainment|Young Money]], [[Cash Money Records|Cash Money]] and [[Universal Republic Records|Universal Republic]] as the fifth single from the album. The song was written by Minaj, Lukasz Gottwald, Allan Grigg, Max Martin and Henry Walter and produced by [[Dr. Luke]], [[Kool Kojak]] and [[Cirkut (producer)|Cirkut]]. Being released as the fifth single, it was sent to UK radio stations on September 12, 2012 and later sent to Top 40/Mainstream radio on October 23, 2012. It was planned to serve as the [[lead single]], but its release was postponed at the last minute in favor of "[[Starships (song)|Starships]]"; it was later released as a promotion for the album's [[reissue]] ''[[Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded <U+2013> The Re-Up]]''.

"Va Va Voom" is an [[Synthpop|electropop]] and [[Electronic dance music|electronic dance]] song with lyrics that talks about sexual activity towards a male. Upon its release, the song received acclaim from critics, with many finding it her best dance song, along with it being catchy and radio-friendly. Commercially, the song entered the top twenty in countries including Ireland, Slovakia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. An accompanying music video was shot in December 2011, but was initially shelved after Minaj decided not to release "Va Va Voom" as the album's lead single, because she was not happy with the video's end result. ''Va Va Voom'' was then included on her setlist for her ''[[Pink Friday: Reloaded Tour]]''.

===Synopsis===
[[File:VVVoomMinaj.jpg|left|255px|thumbnail|Minaj's mythical persona is showcased throughout the video.]]
The video begins with a rising sunset set in a fairytale like setting set in the wilderness. Two [[unicorns]] appear running across water, a reference to the movie Legend, before Minaj appears in a costume with a male companion (rumored to be Robin Hood) behind her, and special effects are displayed throughout the video. Minaj and the boy, dressed in a [[nobleman]]'s attire continue to be flirtatious towards one another throughout the video, and he tries to woo Minaj, but she continues to play hard to get. The unicorns appear once more before Minaj is shown in another bizarre costume accompanied by a blonde wig. Then Minaj appears to be channeling the fairy tale princesses [[Sleeping Beauty (Disney film)|Sleeping Beauty]] and [[Snow White (Disney)|Snow White]], while cooking, a [[knight]] appears before Minaj and intimidates her with his [[sword]]. She then appears to be lying inside of a glass showcase (possibly a glass "coffin", as follows the story of Snow White). In the end, Nicki pulls a surprising twist by appearing as the evil Queen and seducing the male companion when he arrives to save the "Snow White (Nicki)" from the glass showcase.

===Reception===
Gina Serpe from E! News gave the video a positive review, stating: "It's safe to say this video has something for everyone. Starting with Nicki herself looking damn good".<ref>[http://www.eonline.com/news/357729/nicki-minaj-s-quot-va-va-voom-quot-music-video-premiere-mdash-watch-now?cmpid=sn-000000-twitterfeed-365-topstories&utm_source=eonline&utm_medium=twitterfeed&utm_campaign=twitterfeed_topstories&%3Fcmpid=eonline-twitter&dlvrit=48939 Nicki Minajs Va Va Voom Music Video Premiere Watch Now | E!
