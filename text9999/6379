==History==
[[File:Pyetrykaw-market-1912.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Pyetrykaw market, onions and garlic, 1912]]
Prior to 1500 the history of Pyetrykaw is that of the [[Principality of Turov and Pinsk]]. Thus it passed under control of the [[Kingdom of Galicia<U+2013>Volhynia]] in the early 1200s, and was devastated in 1240 by the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongols]], and thereafter remained under the titular control of the [[Golden Horde]] until it joined the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] in the early 1300s, just before Poland conquered the Kingdom of Galicia<U+2013>Volhynia in 1349.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Zdan, Michael B. |title=The Dependence of Halych-Volyn' Rus' on the Golden Horde|journal=The Slavonic and East European Review|volume=35|number=85|year=1957|page=522}}</ref>  In 1502 and 1521 the area was attacked by [[Tatars]] from the newly independent [[Crimean Khanate]]. 

The first written mention of Petrykaw goes back to the year 1523, where the community was under the [[Olelkovich|Olelkovich family's]]  [[Duchy of Slutsk<U+2013>Kapyl]], part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The city became part of the [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1569, and so remained until its annexation by the [[Russian Empire]] at the [[second partition of Poland]] in 1793.  Pyetrykaw was administratively placed in the Mazyr District (Mozyr uezd) of [[Minsk Governorate]]. By the 19th century it had come under the control of the [[Chodkiewicz family|Chodkiewicz]] noble Russian family.

In 1900, Pyetrykaw was located in the area of the Russian Empire that allowed resident Jews, and had a Jewish community of 2,151 people, 38.8% of the total population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://data.jewishgen.org/wconnect/wc.dll?jg~jgsys~community~-1947888 |title=Pyetrykaw, Belarus|publisher=JewishGen Communities Database}}</ref> The town was occupied by the Germans in World War I. It was occupied by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1920-1921, during the [[Polish-Soviet War]]. Pyetrykaw received its status as a [[town]] in 1923. During World War II the town was occupied by the Germans, and the Jewish community was exterminated. 

Pyetrykaw was taken from the Germans on 30 June 1944 as part of [[Operation Bagration]] by the soldiers of the 55th Mozyr Red Rifle Division of the 61st Army of the [[1st Belorussian Front]] and sailors of the 20th Brigade of the Dnieper Flotilla. More than 3,000 casualties were suffered by the Soviet troops during the battle for Pyetrykaw. 

Pyetrykaw is located in the area affected by the [[Chernobyl disaster]].

==Economy==
Among the first industries in Pyetrykaw were the construction of barges for the river traffic and  a brick factory.  During the Soviet era the shipyard was expanded, and various small manufacturing plants were built, including a bread factory. The town depends upon both river traffic and road traffic for much of its livelihood. There are good road connections with Gomel, [[Brest]], and Mazyr.  There is no bridge across the Pripyat, but there is regular ferry service.
