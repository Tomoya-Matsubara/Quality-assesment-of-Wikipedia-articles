}}The '''greytail skate'''  or '''grey tail skate''' (''Bathyraja griseocauda'') is a large [[species]] of [[skate]] in the family [[Arhynchobatidae]], native to the southwest [[Atlantic]] ocean and southeast [[Pacific]] ocean.  It is listed as [[endangered species|endangered]] by the [[IUCN]].<ref name='iucn'/> It was caught as part of a commercial fishery around the [[Falkland Islands]]<ref name='Wakeford'>{{cite journal | last = Wakeford | first = R.C. | other = D.

== Range and distribution ==

In the Atlantic ocean, the greytail skate is found off the coast of [[Argentina]] and in the waters surrounding the [[Faulkland Islands]].  The northern extent of its range in the Atlantic is 37 degrees South.<ref name='iucn'/>  Its range extends very slightly past [[Cape Horn]] into the Pacific ocean, off the coast of [[Chile]],<ref name='saez04'>{{cite journal | first1 = S. | last1 = Saez | first2 = J. | last2 = Lamilla | title = Sexual homodonty in Bathyraja griseocauda (Norman 1937) from the Southern Eastern Pacific (Chile) (Chondrichthyes, Rajidae: Arhynchobatinae) | journal = Journal of Applied Ichthyology | volume = 20 | pages = 189-193 | date = 2004}}</ref> but does not extend beyond a northern extent of 41 degrees South.<ref name='iucn'/>

Although greytail skates have been found in waters as shallow as {{convert|51|m}},<ref name='fishbase'>{{FishBase | genus = Bathyraja | species = griseocauda | id = 27229 | month = March | year = 2012}}</ref> they are most often found deeper than {{convert|250|m}}.  They are found all over the contiental shelf surrounding the Falkland Islands, but are found in highest concentration in the western, deeper shelf margin.<ref name='arkhipkin08'>{{cite journal | first = A.I. | last = Arkhipkin | other = N. Baumgartner, P. Brickle, V.V. Laptikhovsky, J.H.W. Pompert, and Z.N.

Individuals also segregate spatially by age class.  Nursery grounds near the Falkland Islands are generally located at depths of 300-350m.  Juveniles are found in deeper water, {{convert|400|to|600|m}}, but migrate either to the upper slope ({{convert|200|to|400|m}}) or  into deeper water (below {{convert|600|m}}) after growing to {{convert|40|to|45|cm}} in length.<ref name='arkhipkin08'/>

The current population size of the greytail skate is not known.<ref name='iucn'/>  However the [[catch per unit effort]] has declined from 1993-2001<ref name='Wakeford'/>, as well as a decrease in size.<ref name='iucn'/>  These indicators led to the partial closure of the fishery around the Falklands, although no assessments have been completed to gauge current status. The frequency of bycatch and slow growth rate have led fisheries scientists to believe the fisheries restriction has not reversed the decline.<ref name='iucn'/>

== Biology and description ==
Recent reports indicate the greytail skate grows to a length of approximately {{convert|130|cm}}, with a maximum reported length of {{convert|157|cm}}.  The disc width is generally less than the total length, growing to a maximum width of approximately {{convert|90|cm}}.<ref name='arkhipkin08'/>  An earlier study found mature individuals to be considerably smaller.<ref name='Llano'>{{cite book | first1 = G.A. | last1 = Llano | first2 = I.E. | last2 = Wallen | title = Biology of the Antarctic Seas IV | date = 1971 | series = Antarctic Fisheries Series, vol 17 | publisher = American Geophysical Union: Washington D.C.}}</ref> The dorsal surface is black-brown and is covered by denticles but lacks spines.  The ventral surface is yellowish with dark spots near the tail.  The tail has 19-27 large spines.<ref name='Llano'/>

The greytail skate is a slow-growing species,<ref name='iucn'/> growing {{convert|4|to|6|cm}} per year.<ref name='arkhipkin08'/> This is slower than most species in the genus ''Bathyraja.''<ref name='iucn'/>  The maximum observed age is 28 years. Sexual maturity is reached at approximately 18 years for females and 14 years for males.<ref name='arkhipkin08'/>  The sex ratio is slightly skewed toward female.<ref name='arkhipkin08'/>  

Like most skates, the greytail skate is [[oviparious]], laying paired eggs with horn-like projections.<ref name='fishbase'/>  It spawns year-round, although lays fewer eggs in the winter.<ref name='arkhipkin08'/>

Younger individuals eat primarily [[amphipods]] and other [[crustaceans]] and [[polychaete]] worms.  These disappear from the diet as the individual ages.  Older individuals eat rajids, ray-finned fish, and cephalopods.<ref name = 'brickle'>{{cite journal | first = P. | last = Brickle | coauthors = V. Laptikhovsky, J. Pompert, and A.

=== Taxonomy ===
Initially classified in the genus ''[[Raja (genus)|Raja]]'', the greytail skate was reclassified as ''Bathyraja'' in 1971, a genus which did not exist in 1947.<ref name='Llano'/> This classification was supported by a morphological phylogenetic analysis<ref name='mceachran98'>{{cite journal | first1 = J.D. | last1 = McEachrun | first2 = K.A. | last2 = Dunn | title = Phylogenetic Analysis of Skates, a Morphologically Conservative Clade of Elasmobranchs (Chondrichthyes: Rajidae) | journal = Copeia | volume = 1998 | pages = 271-290 | date = 1998}}</ref> and genetically.  It is closely related to the [[Bathyraja papilionifera|butterfly skate]], ''Bathyraja papilionifera'', based on similarity of [[mtDNA]] fragments from [[Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I]].<ref name='barcode'>{{cite journal | first = E. | last = Mabragana | others = J.

== Fisheries ==
The greytail skate was the largest component of the rajid catch in the Falkland Island from 1993 to 2001.  It comprised 24.2% of the harvest, followed by the [[white-dotted skate]], ''B. albomaculata'', and the [[broadnose skate]], ''B. brachyurops''.<ref name = 'Wakeford'/>  It is also a bycatch in trawler fisheries targeting [[teleosts]], and long line fisheries targeting [[patagonian toothfish]].<ref name='iucn'/>  Fisheries may be based in the Falkland Islands, Argentia, or Chile.

=== Management ===
The Falkland Islands instituted a management plan in 1994.  The plan identifies two mix-species fisheries, one north and one south of the Falklands.  Fishing for rajids in the north requires a license, while it has been prohibited in the south since 1996.  As of 2005, Argentina had not instituted an elasmobranch managment plan.<ref name='fowler'>{{cite book | first = S.L. | last = Fowler | others = R.D. Cavanagh, M. Camhi, G.H. Burgess, G.M.
