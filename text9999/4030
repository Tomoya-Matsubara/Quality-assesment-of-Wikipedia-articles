'''Imperial War Museum Duxford''' (commonly referred to simply as "Duxford") is a branch of the [[Imperial War Museum]] near the village of [[Duxford]] in [[Cambridgeshire]], England. Britain's largest [[aviation museum]],<ref name=Holt/> Duxford houses the museum's large exhibits, including nearly 200 [[aircraft]], military vehicles, artillery and minor naval vessels in seven main exhibitions buildings.<ref name=A&V>For a list of aircraft, vehicles and boats at Duxford, see {{cite web |date=June 2008 |url=http://duxford.iwm.org.uk/upload/pdf/AircraftandVehicles.pdf |title=IWM Duxford: Aircraft and Vehicles |publisher=Imperial War Museum |accessdate=26 June 2009}}</ref> The site also provides storage space for the museum's [[Imperial War Museum#Collections|other collections]] of material such as film, photographs, documents, books and artefacts. The site accommodates a number of [[British Army]] regimental museums, including those of the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] (named ''[[Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum|Airborne Assault]]'') and the [[Royal Anglian Regiment]].

Based on the historic [[Duxford Aerodrome]], the site was originally operated by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF)  during the [[First World War]]. During the [[Second World War]] Duxford played a prominent role during the [[Battle of Britain]] and was later used by [[United States Army Air Forces]] fighter units in support of the [[Strategic bombing during World War II#US bombing in Europe|daylight bombing]] of Germany. Duxford remained an active RAF airfield until 1961. After the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] declared the site surplus to requirements in 1969 the Imperial War Museum received permission to use part of the site for storage. The entirety of the site was transferred to the museum in February 1976.

In keeping with the site's history many of Duxford's original buildings, such as [[hangar]]s used during the Battle of Britain, are still in use. Many of these buildings are of particular architectural or historic significance and over thirty have [[listed building]] status,<ref name=IWMDhistoric>Imperial War Museum Duxford (2009) [http://duxford.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.5713 Historic Duxford].

Retrieved 14 September 2009.</ref> The site also features a number of purpose-built exhibition buildings, such as the [[Stirling Prize]]-winning American Air Museum, designed by [[Norman Foster (architect)|Sir Norman Foster]]. The site remains an active airfield and is used by a number of civilian flying companies, and hosts regular [[air show]]s. The site is operated in partnership with [[Cambridgeshire County Council]] and the Duxford Aviation Society, a charity formed in 1975 to preserve [[civil aircraft]] and promote appreciation of British civil aviation history.

==Museum history==
{{main|Imperial War Museum}}
The Imperial War Museum originated during the First World War in 1917 as the National War Museum committee, formed by the British government to record the war effort and sacrifice of Britain and [[British Empire|her Empire]]. The museum opened in 1920, by which point it had been renamed the ''Imperial'' War Museum.<ref>Kavanagh, Gaynor 'Museum as Memorial: The Origins of the Imperial War Museum', ''Journal of Contemporary History'' Vol. 23 No. 1 (January 1988). Available via [[JSTOR]] at [http://www.jstor.org/stable/260869]. Retrieved 13 August 2009.</ref> With the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], the museum's terms of reference were enlarged to include the conflict.<ref>'Imperial War Museum: Collection of war relics', ''The Times'' 14 May 1940 Issue 48615 Page 4 Column F</ref> The museum's terms of reference was broadened again in 1953 to include all modern conflicts in which British or [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces were engaged.<ref name="IWMLguide2">''Imperial War Museum London'' (guidebook), (London: Imperial War Museum, 2009) pp. 2 ISBN 978-1-904897-95-8</ref> The effect of these expansions of remit was to cause the museum's collections to expand enormously, to the point that many parts of the collection, especially those of aircraft, vehicles and artillery, could not be effectively stored or exhibited. Although the museum's south London home (a nineteenth century building in [[Southwark]] which was previously the [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]]) had been extended in 1966, by the end of the decade the museum was seeking additional space.<ref name=Frankland>{{cite book | last = Frankland | first = Noble | title = History at War | publisher = Giles de la Mare | location = London | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-1-900357-10-4 | page = 205 }}</ref>

RAF Duxford, a [[Royal Air Force]] fighter station had been declared surplus to requirements by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in 1969, and the museum duly requested permission to use part of one of the airfield's hangars as temporary storage. Duxford featured three double bay hangars of First World War vintage, which together provided over 9000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> of space. Within two years, ten of the museum's aircraft had been brought to Duxford, and were being restored by volunteers of the East Anglia Aviation Society. While the museum's own aircraft were not restored to flying condition, by cooperating with private groups the museum was able to mount its first airshow in 1973. Further air shows followed, with a display in June 1976 attracting an audience of 45,000 people. The runway was bought by [[Cambridgeshire County Council]] in 1977. The success of these shows provided a valuable source of revenue, and complemented the efforts of volunteers, so that the museum applied for the permanent transfer of the entire site to its use. Permission was received in February 1976 and Duxford became the first outstation of the Imperial War Museum. Initially open from March<U+2013>October, Duxford received 167,000 visitors in the 1977 season, and 340,000 in 1978. Two million visitors had been received by 1982<ref>Frankland (1999) pg. 205<U+2013>208.</ref> and Duxford welcomed its ten millionth visitor in August 2005.<ref>[http://www.nationalmuseums.org.uk/ National Museum Directors' Conference] (September 2005) [http://www.nationalmuseums.org.uk/media/documents/newsletters/newslettersep05.doc Newsletter] No.48.

Duxford was officially returned to the RAF on 1 December 1945. It remained a fighter station but by 1958 changing defence priorities saw the RAF's fighter force move to more northerly bases. Duxford's last operational flight was made in July 1961. No longer operational, the site gradually became increasingly derelict and overgrown. In 1968 the American film studio [[United Artists]] obtained permission to use the site for the filming of ''[[Battle of Britain (film)|Battle of Britain]]''. During the shoot a single bay hangar, which had been built during the First World War, was demolished to simulate an air raid.<ref>Cheek, Tim (1998) 'Duxford: An unofficial history of one of the RAF's most distinguished airfields' [http://www.gdg18.dial.pipex.com/battleofbritain.shtml Battle of Britain].

As an active civil airfield, operations at Duxford are regulated by the [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|Civil Aviation Authority]] (CAA). In 2002 a privately operated [[Aero L-39 Albatros]] suffered a braking failure on landing, overran the runway and came to rest on the M11 motorway, a student pilot being killed after ejecting at ground level. An [[Air Accidents Investigation Branch]] inquiry recommended a review of arrangements for aircraft taking off or landing towards the M11. As a result, the CAA and Duxford agreed to a reduction in the runway's 1500&nbsp;m declared length, from 1350&nbsp;m to 1200&nbsp;m, in order to provide a greater margin of error.<ref>[[Air Accident Investigation Branch]] (July 2003) [http://www.aaib.gov.uk/cms_resources.cfm?file=/dft_avsafety_pdf_022817.pdf Aero Vodochody L-39C Albatros, G-BZVL].

Visible on the right is the large AirSpace exhibition hall, Hangars 2, 3, 4 and 5, the American Air Museum and the eastern end of the runway.]] When originally planned in 1917, Duxford aerodrome was to occupy a {{convert|238|acre|km2 sqmi|adj=on}} site divided by what is now the [[A505 road]] which runs north-east from [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]] to [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]]. The area north of the road would be occupied by accommodation and administrative buildings with the airfield, hangars and technical buildings on the south side. Still divided by the A505, the museum's site is now bounded to the east by the [[M11 motorway]], which meets the A505 adjacent to the museum site at Junction 10. The construction of the M11 in 1977 forced the shortening of the runway by 300&nbsp;m. In its role as a museum, the north side of the site is occupied by the Imperial War Museum's stored collections and is not generally open to the public, while the south side is occupied by various hangars and other historic buildings, purpose-built structures, and by two runways.

The south side visitor entrance, which now houses a shop and visitor facilities, was previously the airfield's armoury.<ref name=DUsite>Duxford Update: A Duxford Buildings Tour [http://homepage.ntlworld.com/mclaydon/dx-fieldframe.htm www.Duxford-Update.info].

==Hangar 4: Battle of Britain Exhibition==
[[File:Bf109atimperialwarmuseumduxford.jpg|thumb|Tableau of crashed Bf-109E in Hangar 4.]]Hangar 4 is one of Duxford's historic hangars, and now houses an exhibition exploring Duxford's history as an operational RAF airfield from the First World War to the [[Cold War]]. The early period is represented by a [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol Fighter]], a type operated by Duxford's No.2 Flying Training School from 1920. The latter period is represented by a [[Hawker Hunter]] which flew at Duxford with [[No. 65 Squadron RAF]], a [[Gloster Javelin]], the type which made the last operational flight at Duxford in 1961, and by a Hungarian [[Mikoyan|Mikoyan-Gurevich]] [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]], a common [[Warsaw Pact]] jet fighter. Britain's air defence during the Second World War is particularly emphasised, with exhibits representing the Battle of Britain, [[the Blitz]] and the [[V-1 flying bomb]] offensive from 1944. Notable aircraft include a [[Messerschmitt Bf-109]]E which was flown during the Battle of Britain until forced down in [[Sussex]] due to engine failure. It is displayed as part of a tableau showing the crashed aircraft under guard. One unusual aircraft on display is the [[Juan de la Cierva|Cierva]] [[Cierva C.30|C.30A]] [[autogyro]], which was used by 74 (Signals) Wing, based at Duxford, to test the calibration of coastal radar units.<ref name=cheek39-42/><ref>See also Imperial War Museum Duxford [http://duxford.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.5716 Hangar 4: The Battle of Britain] and [http://duxford.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.1224/setPaginate/No The Battle of Britain Exhibition].

With Duxford's association with the [[US Army Air Forces]], in the mid-1980s plans developed for a commemoration of the role of American air power in the [[Second World War]]. A group of American supporters was formed, and the architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Sir Norman Foster]] was commissioned to design a new building. Fundraising for the project began in 1987, support and funds being sought in the United States; the Founding Member was General [[Jimmy Doolittle]] in 1989. Fundraising events were held across the US in Houston (1989), [[Washington, D.C.]], (1991) and Los Angeles (1992).

===Architecture and construction===
The American Air Museum was designed by Sir Norman Foster and [[Chris Wise]] at [[Arup]]. The museum's specification called for a landmark building that would provide a neutral backdrop for the aircraft collection and provide appropriate climatic controls while being cost efficient to operate. The building is shaped as a section of a [[torus]],<ref>For a demonstration of the building's geometry, see Foster+Partners [http://www.fosterandpartners.com/content/projects/0413/0413_01.mov].
