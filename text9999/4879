He is best known for his work with [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] from 2000-2001 and [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] in 2006 and 2007.

==Career==
===World Championship Wrestling===
After being trained by [[Dean Malenko]],<ref name=oww/> Spencer began his wrestling career in 1998, working for independent promotions in Florida under the names C.G. Afi and Casanova Jones.  His first big break came during his short stay in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) as '''Tony Marinara''', a [[New York]] mobster who managed the team of [[Vito LaGrasso|Big Vito]] and [[John Hugger|Johnny the Bull]], who became known as '''The Mamalukes''' (and later '''The Paisans''').  His storyline included a feud with [[Glenn Gilberti|Disco Inferno]], who [[kayfabe]] owed his "family" money.<ref name=oww/>  At one point, the [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] also involved [[John LeRoux|Lash LeRoux]]. His last appearance came at the [[Souled Out]] 2000 pay-per-view in an interview with [[Gene Okerlund]] he said he had to take care of some business and he left, never to appear in WCW again.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling===
Not long after his release, he started working in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]].  He took on the name '''Tony Mamaluke''', with the last name being a reference to the former tag team he managed in WCW. He joined the [[Full Blooded Italians (professional wrestling)|Full Blooded Italians]] group, which consisted of [[James Maritato|Little Guido]] and Big [[Sal E. Graziano]]. During his stay in ECW, he and Guido captured the [[ECW World Tag Team Championship]] from [[Yoshihiro Tajiri]] and [[Mikey Whipwreck]] on [[August 25]] [[2000]].<ref name=ecwtag>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/history/ecwtaghistory/|title=ECW Tag Team Title History|publisher=WWE.com|accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref> They lost the title, however, on [[December 3]] to [[Danny Doring]] and [[Michael Depoli|Roadkill]].<ref name=ecwtag/> During this time, he also feuded with [[Super Crazy]] and [[Kid Kash]]. He stayed with ECW until the company was declared bankrupt in April 2001.

===Independent circuit===
After ECW folded, Mamaluke worked for [[NWA Wildside]], [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]], and [[World Wrestling All-Stars]], where as part of his [[List of professional wrestling slang#G|gimmick]], the ring announcer announced his weight in liquid ounces rather than pounds or kilograms. He then joined [[Ring of Honor]], where he feuded with his former-partner [[Little Guido]] and also where he tag-teamed with [[John Stagikas|John Walters]] as "The Purists." In late 2003, Mamaluke relocated to [[Los Angeles]] to train in [[martial arts]] at the [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] [[Antonio Inoki|Inoki]] Dojo. He eventually returned to pro wrestling in 2005, winning the [[ROH World Tag Team Championship]] with [[Sal Rinauro]] in his first match back in Ring of Honor.<ref name="rohofficial">{{cite web |url=http://rohwrestling.com/titlehistory/ |title=ROH World Tag Team Championship official title history |accessdate=2007-04-14 |work=ROHwrestling.com }}</ref><ref name="rohresults">{{cite web |url=http://rohwrestling.com/pastresults/ |title=ROH official event results |accessdate=2007-04-14 |work=ROHwrestling.com }}</ref> The duo held the belts from [[October 1]] [[2005]] to [[December 17]], when they lost them at ''Final Battle 2005''.<ref name="rohofficial"/><ref name="rohresults"/>
