==Description==
''Streptanthus fenestratus'' is an annual herb producing a hairless, waxy stem up 35 or 40 centimeters in maximum height. The basal leaves have blades divided into several lobes or leaflets. Leaves higher on the stem have oval or lance-shaped blades usually not subdivided. Flowers occur at intervals along the upper stem with one or two leaflike green or purple-tipped [[bract]]s at the base of the [[raceme]]. Each flower has a tubular urn-shaped calyx of purple [[sepal]]s just under a centimeter long. Light petals up to 1.5 centimeters long emerge from the tip of the calyx. The fruit is a flat, narrow [[silique]] up to 5 centimeters long. 

One of the main threats to this species is trampling by [[hiking|hikers]].<ref name=tnc/>
