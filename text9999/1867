'''Charles Pierre Baudelaire''' (French [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[<U+0283>a<U+0280>l bod'l<U+025B><U+0280>]}}) ([[April 9]], [[1821]] &ndash; [[August 31]], [[1867]]) was an influential nineteenth century [[French poetry|French poet]]. He was also a [[critic]] and [[translator]].

==Life and work==
Baudelaire was born in [[Paris]]. His father, a senior [[civil service|civil servant]] and amateur [[artist]], died early in Baudelaire's life in [[1827]]. In the following year, his mother married a [[lieutenant colonel]] Jacques Aupick, who later became a French [[ambassador]] to various [[noble court|courts]]. Baudelaire was educated in [[Lyon]] and at the [[Lyc<U+00E9>e Louis-le-Grand|Coll<U+00E8>ge Louis-le-Grand]] in Paris.  Upon gaining his [[Academic degree|degree]] in [[1839]], he decided to embark upon a literary career, and, for the next two years led a somewhat irregular life.  It is believed that he contracted [[syphilis]] during this period.  In the hope of reforming him, his [[legal guardian|guardians]], sent him on a voyage to [[India]] in [[1841]], although he never actually arrived there. When he returned to Paris, after less than a year's absence, he was of age; but within a couple of years his extravagance threatened to exhaust his small [[inheritance]], and his family obtained a decree to place his property in trust. It was in this period that he met [[Jeanne Duval]], who was to become his longest romantic association.

His [[art]] reviews of [[1845]] and [[1846]] attracted immediate attention for their boldness: many of his critical opinions were novel in their time, but have since been generally accepted. He took part in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|revolutionaries in 1848]], and for some years was interested in [[Republicanism|republican]] politics, but his political convictions spanned the anarchism of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], the history of the ''Raison d'<U+0116>tat'' of [[Giuseppe Ferrari]], and [[ultramontanism|ultramontane]] critique of liberalism of [[Joseph de Maistre]]. Baudelaire was a slow and fastidious worker, and it was not until [[1857]] that he produced his first and most famous volume of [[poem]]s, ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' ("The Flowers of Evil"). Some of these poems had already appeared in the ''[[Revue des deux mondes]]'' (Review of Two Worlds), when they were published by Baudelaire's friend [[Auguste Poulet Malassis]], who had inherited a [[printing]] business at [[Alen<U+00E7>on]]. The poems found a small appreciative audience, but greater public attention was given to their subject matter. The principal themes of [[Human sexuality|sex]] and [[death]] were considered scandalous, and the book became a by-word for unwholesomeness among mainstream [[critic]]s of the day. Baudelaire, his [[publisher]], and the [[printer (publisher)|printer]] were successfully [[prosecution|prosecuted]] for creating an offence against public [[morality|morals]]. In the poem "Au lecteur" ("To the Reader") that prefaces ''Les fleurs du mal'', Baudelaire accuses his readers of [[hypocrisy]] and of being as guilty of [[sin]]s and [[lie]]s as the poet:

:... If [[rape]] or [[arson]], [[poison]], or the [[knife]]
:Has wove no pleasing patterns in the stuff
:Of this drab [[canvas]] we accept as life&mdash;
:It is because we are not bold enough!

::([[Roy Campbell (Poet)|Roy Campbell's]] [[translation]])

Five of the poems were suppressed, but printed later as ''Les <U+00C9>paves'' ("The Wrecks") ([[Brussels]], [[1866]]). Another [[edition]] of ''Les fleurs du mal'', without these poems, but with considerable additions, appeared in [[1861]].

His other works include ''Petits Po<U+00E8>mes en prose'' ("Small [[prose poetry|Prose poems]]"); a series of art reviews published in the ''Pays, Exposition universelle'' ("Country, World Fair"); studies on [[Gustave Flaubert]] (in ''Lartisge'', [[October 18]], 1857); on [[Th<U+00E9>ophile Gautier]] (''Revue contemporaine'', September, [[1858]]); various articles contributed to Eugene Crepet's ''Po<U+00E8>tes francais''; ''Les Paradis artificiels: opium et haschisch'' ("French poets; Artificial Paradises: opium and hashish") ([[1860]]); and ''Un Dernier Chapitre de l'histoire des oeuvres de Balzac'' ("A Final Chapter of the history of works of Balzac") ([[1880]]), originally an article entitled "Comment on paye ses dettes quand on a du g<U+00E9>nie" ("How one pays one's debts when one has genius"), in which his criticism turns against his friends [[Honor<U+00E9> de Balzac]], [[Th<U+00E9>ophile Gautier]], and [[G<U+00E9>rard de Nerval]].

Baudelaire had learned [[English language|English]] in his childhood, and [[Gothic novel]]s, such as [[Matthew Gregory Lewis|Lewis's]] ''[[The Monk]]'', became some of his favourite reading matter. In [[1846]] and [[1847]] he became acquainted with the works of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], in which he found tales and poems which had, he claimed, long existed in his own brain but never taken shape. From this time until [[1865]], he was largely occupied with his translated versions of Poe's works, which were widely praised. These were published as ''Histoires extraordinaires'' ("Extraordinary stories") ([[1852]]), ''Nouvelles histoires extraordinaires'' ("New extraordinary stories") (1857), ''Aventures d'Arthur Gordon Pym'' (see [[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym]]), ''Eureka'', and ''Histoires grotesques et s<U+00E9>rieuses'' ("Grotesque and serious stories") ([[1865]]). Two [[essay]]s on Poe are to be found in his ''Oeuvres compl<U+00E8>tes'' ("Complete works") (vols. v. and vi.). 

Meanwhile his [[finance|financial]] difficulties increased, particularly after his publisher Poulet Malassis went bankrupt in [[1861]], and in [[1864]] he left Paris for [[Belgium]], partly in the hope of selling the [[copyright|rights]] to his works. For many years he had a long-standing relationship with a bi-racial woman, [[Jeanne Duval]], whom he helped to the end of his life. He had recourse to [[opium]], and in Brussels he began to [[alcoholism|drink to excess]]. He suffered a massive stroke in 1866 and [[paralysis]] followed and the last two years of his life were spent in "maisons de sant<U+00E9>" in Brussels and in Paris, where he died on [[August 31]], [[1867]]. Many of his works were published posthumously.

He is buried in the [[Cimeti<U+00E8>re du Montparnasse]], Paris.

==Influence==

Baudelaire's influence on the direction of modern French- and English-language literature was considerable.  The most significant French writers to come after him were generous with tributes; four years after his death, [[Arthur Rimbaud]] praised him in a letter as 'the king of poets, a true God'.<ref>Rimbaud, Arthur: ''Oeuvres compl<U+00E8>tes'', p. 253, NRF/Gallimard, 1972.</ref>  In [[1895]], [[St<U+00E9>phane Mallarm<U+00E9>]] published a sonnet in Baudelaire's memory, 'Le Tombeau de Charles Baudelaire'.  [[Marcel Proust]], in an essay published in [[1922]], stated that along with [[Alfred de Vigny]], Baudelaire was 'the greatest poet of the nineteenth century'.<ref>'Concerning Baudelaire' in Proust, Marcel: ''Against Sainte-Beuve and Other Essays'', p. 286, trans. John Sturrock, Penguin, 1994.</ref>  

In the English-speaking world, [[Edmund Wilson]] credited Baudelaire as providing an initial impetus for the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] movement, by virtue of his translations of Poe.<ref>Wilson, Edmund: ''Axel's Castle'',p. 20, Fontana, 1962 (originally published 1931).</ref>  In [[1930]] [[T.S. Eliot]], while asserting that Baudelaire had not yet received a 'just appreciation' even in France, claimed that the poet had 'great genius' and asserted that his 'technical mastery which can hardly be overpraised ... has made his verse an inexhaustible study for later poets, not only in his own language.'<ref>'Baudelaire', in Eliot, T.S.: ''Selected Essays'', pp. 422 and 425, Faber & Faber, 1961.</ref>

At the same time that Eliot was affirming Baudelaire's importance from a broadly [[Conservatism|conservative]] and explicitly [[Christianity|Christian]] viewpoint,<ref>cf. Eliot, 'Religion in Literature', in Eliot, op. cit., p.388.</ref> [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] critics such as Wilson and [[Walter Benjamin]] were able to do so from a dramatically different perspective.  Benjamin translated Baudelaire's ''[[Tableaux Parisiens]]'' into German and published a major essay on translation<ref>'The Task of the Translator', in Benjamin, Walter: ''Selected Writings Vol. 1: 1913-1926'', pp. 253-263, Belknap/Harvard, 1996.</ref> as the foreword.  In the late [[1930s]], Benjamin used Baudelaire as a starting point and focus for his monumental attempt at a [[Historical materialism|materialist]] assessment of 19th century culture, ''[[Arcades Project|Das Passagenwerk]].''<ref>Benjamin, Walter: ''The Arcades Project'', trans. Howard Eiland and Kevin McLaughlin, Belknap/Harvard, 1999.</ref>  For Benjamin, Baudelaire's importance lay in his anatomies of the [[crowd]], of the [[city]] and of [[modernity]].<ref>'The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire' in Benjamin, Walter: ''Selected Writings Vol. 4 1938-1940'', pp. 3-92, Belknap/Harvard, 2003.</ref>
