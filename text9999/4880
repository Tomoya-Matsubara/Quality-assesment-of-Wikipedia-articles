'''Psychotherapy''' is an [[interpersonal]], [[relation]]al intervention used by trained psychotherapists to aid [[client]]s in problems of living. This usually includes increasing individual sense of [[well-being]] and reducing subjective discomforting experience. Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship building, [[dialogue]], [[communication]] and [[behavior]] change and that are designed to improve the [[mental health]] of a client or patient, or to improve group relationships (such as in a [[family]]).
==Forms==
Most forms of psychotherapy use only spoken [[conversation]], though some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, [[Work of art|artwork]], [[drama]], [[narrative]] story, or [[therapeutic touch]]. Psychotherapy occurs within a structured encounter between a trained [[therapist]] and client(s). Purposeful, theoretically based psychotherapy began in the 19th century with [[psychoanalysis]]; since then, scores of other approaches have been developed and continue to be created.

Therapy is generally used to respond to a variety or specific or non-specific manifestations of clinically diagnosable crises. Treatment of everyday problems is more often referred to as counseling (a distinction originally adopted by Carl Rogers) but the term is sometimes used interchangeably with "psychotherapy".

Psychotherapeutic interventions are often designed to treat the patient in the medical model, although not all psychotherapeutic approaches follow the model of "illness/cure". Some practitioners, such as humanistic schools, see themselves in an educational or helper role. Because sensitive topics are often discussed during psychotherapy, therapists are expected, and usually legally bound, to respect client or patient confidentiality.
==Systems of Psychotherapy==
There are several main systems of psychotherapy: 
*[[Cognitive behavioural therapy|Cognitive behavioral]]
*[[Psychodynamic psychotherapy|Psychodynamic]]
*[[Existential Therapy|Existential]]
*[[Humanistic psychology|Humanistic/supportive]]
*[[Brief therapy]] (sometimes called "strategic" therapy, [[solution focused brief therapy]])
*[[Systemic Therapy]] (including [[family therapy]] & [[marriage counseling]])
*[[Integrative Psychotherapy]]

==History==

:''See also [[Timeline of psychotherapy]] 
In an informal sense, psychotherapy can be said to have been practiced through the ages, as individuals received psychological counsel and reassurance from others. Purposeful, theoretically-based psychotherapy was probably first developed in the [[Middle East]] during the 8th century by the [[Persian people|Persian]] physician [[Rhazes]], who was at one time the chief physician of the Baghdad hospital. Serious [[mental disorders]], however, were generally treated in the West as demonic or medical conditions requiring punishment and confinement until the advent of [[moral treatment]] approaches in the 18th Century. This brought about a focus on the possibility of psychosocial intervention - including reasoning, moral encouragement and group activities - to rehabilitate the "insane". 

[[Image:Sigmund-Freud-1907.jpg|thumb|[[Sigmund Freud]], founder of [[Psychoanalysis]]]]

[[Psychoanalysis]] was perhaps the first specific school of psychotherapy, developed by [[Sigmund Freud]] and others through the early 1900s. Trained as a [[neurologist]], Freud began focusing on problems that appeared to have no discernible organic basis, and theorized that they had psychological causes originating in childhood experiences and the unconscious mind. Techniques such as [[dream interpretation]], [[free association]], [[transference]] and analysis of the [[id, ego and superego]] were developed.

Many theorists built upon Freud's fundamental ideas, including [[Anna Freud]], [[Alfred Adler]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Karen Horney]], [[Otto Rank]], [[Erik Erikson]], [[Melanie Klein]], and [[Heinz Kohut]] and often formed their own differentiating systems of psychotherapy. These were all later termed under a more broad label of ''[[psychodynamic]]'', meaning anything that involved the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]'s [[conscious]]/[[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] influence on external relationships and the self. Sessions tended to number into the hundreds over several years. 

[[Image:Alfred Adler.jpg|thumb|[[Alfred Adler]] created [[Individual psychology]], one of the first major variations on Freud's [[Psychoanalysis]], and a precursor to [[Humanistic psychology]].]]

[[Behaviorism]] developed in the 1920s, and [[behavior modification]] as a therapy became popularized in the 1950s and 1960s. Notable contributors were [[Joseph Wolpe]] in South Africa, M.B. Shipiro and [[Hans Eysenck]] in Britain, and [[B.F. Skinner]] in the United States. [[Behavioral therapy]] approaches relied on principles of [[operant conditioning]], [[classical conditioning]] and [[social learning theory]] to bring about therapeutic change in observable symptoms. The approach became commonly used for [[phobias]], as well as other disorders.  

Some therapeutic approaches developed out of the European school of [[existential philosophy]]. Concerned mainly with the individual's ability to develop and preserve a sense of meaning and purpose throughout life, major contributors to the field (e.g., [[Irvin Yalom]], [[Rollo May]]) and Europe ([[Viktor Frankl]], Ludwig Binswanger, Medard Boss, [[Ronald David Laing|R.D.Laing]], [[Emmy van Deurzen]]) attempted to create therapies sensitive to common 'life crises' springing from the essential bleakness of human self awareness, previously accessible only through the complex writings of existential philosophers (e.g., [[S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], Gabriel Marcel, Martin Heidegger, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]). The uniqueness of the patient-therapist relationship thus also forms a vehicle for therapeutic enquiry. 

[[Image:Carlrogers.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Rogers]], therapist associated with [[Person-centered psychotherapy]]]]
 
A related body of thought in psychotherapy started in the [[1950s]] with [[Carl Rogers]]. Based in [[existentialism]] and the works of [[Abraham Maslow]] and his [[hierarchy of human needs]], Rogers brought [[person-centered psychotherapy]] into mainstream focus.  Rogers' basic tenets were [[unconditional positive regard]], genuineness, and [[empathy|empathic understanding]], with each demonstrated by the [[wiktionary:Counselor|counselor]]. The aim was to create a relationship conducive to enhancing the client's psychological well being, by enabling the client to fully experience and express themselves.  Others developed the approach, like [[Fritz Perls|Fritz]] and [[Laura Perls]] in the creation of [[Gestalt therapy]], as well as Marshall Rosenberg, founder of [[Nonviolent Communication]], and  [[Eric Berne]], founder of [[Transactional Analysis]].  Later these fields of psychotherapy would become what is known as [[humanistic psychology|humanistic psychotherapy]] today. Self-help groups and books became widespread. 

[[Image:Albert Ellis 2003 seated.jpg|thumb|left|[[Albert Ellis]], founder of [[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]]]]

During the 1950s, [[Albert Ellis]] developed [[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy|Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT)]]. A few years later, psychiatrist [[Aaron T. Beck]] developed a form of psychotherapy known as [[cognitive therapy]]. Both of these included short, structured and present-focused therapy aimed at changing a person's [[Cognitive distortion|distorted thinking]], by contrast with the long-lasting insight-based approach of psychodynamic or humanistic therapies.  Cognitive and behavioral therapy approaches were combined during the 1970s, resulting in [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]]. Being oriented towards symptom-relief, collaborative empiricism and modifying peoples core beliefs, the approach gained widespread acceptance as a primary treatment for numerous disorders. A "third wave" of cognitive and behavioral therapies developed, including [[Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]] and [[Dialectical behavior therapy]], which expanded the concepts to other disorders and/or added novel components. 

[[Counseling]] methods developed, including [[solution focused brief therapy|solution-focused therapy]] and [[systemic coaching]]. [[Postmodern]] psychotherapies such as [[Narrative Therapy]] and [[coherence therapy]] did not impose definitions of mental health and illness, but rather saw the goal of therapy as something constructed by the client and therapist in a social context. [[Family therapy|Systems Therapy]] also developed, which focuses on family and group dynamics<U+2014>and [[Transpersonal psychology]], which focuses on the spiritual facet of human experience. Other important orientations developed in the last three decades include [[Feminist therapy]], [[Brief therapy]], [[Somatic Psychology]], [[Expressive therapy]], and applied [[Positive Psychology]].

==General issues==

Psychotherapy can be seen as an interpersonal invitation offered by (often trained and regulated) psychotherapists to aid clients in reaching their full potential or to cope better with problems of [[life]]. Psychotherapists usually receive a benefit or remuneration in some form in return for their time and skills. This is one way in which the [[List of basic relationship topics|relationship]] can be distinguished from an [[altruism|altruistic]] offer of assistance.  	

Psychotherapy often includes techniques to increase awareness for example, or to enable other choices of thought, feeling or action; to increase the sense of well-being and to better manage subjective discomfort or distress. Psychotherapy can be provided on a one to one basis or in group therapy. It can occur face to face, over the telephone or the internet. Its time frame may be a matter of weeks or over many years. It can be seen as  ultimately about [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and the [[Meaning of life (philosophy)|meaning of life]]. Psychotherapy can also be seen as a [[Social construction|social construct]] that cannot occur in a [[Power (sociology)|power]] vacuum nor without reference to [[semiotics]] (meaning systems and symbols) - irrespective of how practitioners may describe their work or research its effects. 	Therapy may address specific forms of diagnosable [[mental illness]], or everyday problems in relationships or meeting personal goals. Treatment of everyday problems is more often referred to as '''counseling''' (a distinction originally adopted by [[Carl Rogers]]) but the term is sometimes used interchangeably with "psychotherapy".

Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques to [[Power (sociology)|influence]] or [[Persuasion|pursuade]] the client to adapt or change in the direction the client has chosen. These can be based on clear thinking about their options; experiential relationship building; dialogue, communication and adoption of behavior change strategies. Each is designed to improve the [[mental health]] of a client or [[patient]], or to improve group relationships (such as in a family). Most forms of psychotherapy use only spoken conversation, though some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, artwork, drama, narrative story, or therapeutic touch. Psychotherapy occurs within a structured encounter between a trained therapist and client(s). Because sensitive topics are often discussed during psychotherapy, therapists are expected, and usually legally bound, to respect [[client confidentiality|client or patient confidentiality]]. 	 

Psychotherapists are often trained, [[professional certification|certified]], and [[licensure|licensed]], with a range of different certifications and licensing requirements in every jurisdiction. Psychotherapy may be undertaken by [[clinical psychologists]], [[social workers]], [[family therapy|marriage-family therapists]], [[Expressive therapy|expressive therapists]], trained [[nurses]], [[psychiatrists]], [[psychoanalysts]], [[Mental Health Counselor|mental health counselors]], [[school counselor]]s, or professionals of other mental health disciplines. [[Psychiatry|Psychiatrists]] have medical qualifications and may also administer [[drugs|prescription medication]].  The primary training of a psychiatrist focuses on the biological aspects of mental health conditions, with some training in psychotherapy. [[Psychologists]] have more training in [[psychological assessment]] and [[research]] and, in addition, a great deal of training in psychotherapy. [[Social workers]] have specialized training in linking patients to community and institutional resources, in addition to elements of psychological assessment and psychotherapy. Marriage-Family Therapists have training similar to the social worker, and also have specific training and experience working with relationships and family issues. Licensed professional counselors (LPCs) generally have special training in career, mental health, [[school counselor|school]], or rehabilitation counseling. Many of the wide variety of training programs are multiprofessional, that is, psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health nurses, and social workers may be found in the same training group. Consequently, specialized psychotherapeutic training in most countries requires a program of continuing education after the basic degree, or involve multiple certifications attached to one specific degree.

==Specific schools and approaches==

{{main|list of psychotherapies}}

===Psychoanalysis===

[[Psychoanalysis]] was the earliest form of psychotherapy, but many other theories and techniques are also now used by psychotherapists, [[Psychology|psychologists]], [[Psychiatry|psychiatrists]], [[Facilitator|personal growth facilitators]]  and [[social work]]ers. Techniques for [[group therapy]] have been developed.

While behaviour is often a target of the work, many approaches value working with feelings and thoughts. This is especially true of the psychodynamic schools of psychotherapy, which today include Jungian therapy and Psychodrama as well as the [[psychoanalytic]] schools. Other approaches focus on the link between the mind and body and try to access deeper levels of the psyche through manipulation of the physical body. Examples  are [[Rolfing]], Pulsing and [[postural integration]].{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

===Group Psychotherapy===

The therapeutic use of groups in modern clinical practice can be traced to the early years of the 20th century, when the American chest physician Pratt, working in Boston, described forming 'classes' of fifteen to twenty patients with tuberculosis who had been rejected for sanatorium treatment{{Fact|date=June 2007}}. The term 'group therapy', however, was first used around 1920 by [[Jacob L. Moreno]], whose main contribution was the development of [[psychodrama]], in which groups were used as both cast and audience for the exploration of individual problems by reenactment under the direction of the leader. The more analytic and exploratory use of groups in both hospital and out-patient settings was pioneered by a few European psychoanalysts who emigrated to the USA, such as [[Paul Schilder]], who treated severely neurotic and mildly psychotic out-patients in small groups at Bellevue Hospital, New York. The power of groups was most influentially demonstrated in Britain during the Second World War, when several psychoanalysts and psychiatrists proved the value of group methods for officer selection in the War Office Selection Boards. A chance to run an Army psychiatric unit on group lines was then given to several of these pioneers, notably [[Wilfred Bion]] and Rickman, followed by [[S. H. Foulkes]], Main, and Bridger. The [[Northfield Hospital]] in Birmingham gave its name to what came to be called the two 'Northfield Experiments', which provided the impetus for the development since the war of both social therapy, that is, the [[therapeutic community]] movement, and the use of small groups for the treatment of neurotic and personality disorders.

===Medical and non-medical models===

A distinction can also be made between those psychotherapies that employ a [[medical model]] and those that employ a [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic model]]. In the medical model the client is seen as unwell and the therapist employs their skill to help the client back to health.  The extensive use of the [[DSM-IV]], the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders in the United States, is an example of a medically-exclusive model. 

In the humanistic model, the therapist facilitates learning in the individual and the client's own natural process draws them to a fuller understanding of themselves.  An example would be [[gestalt therapy]].

Some psychodynamic practitioners distinguish between more uncovering and more supportive psychotherapy.  Uncovering psychotherapy emphasizes facilitating the client's insight into the roots of their difficulties.  The best-known example of an uncovering psychotherapy is classical [[psychoanalysis]].  Supportive psychotherapy by contrast stresses strengthening the client's defenses and often providing encouragement and advice.  Depending on the client's personality, a more supportive or more uncovering approach may be optimal.  Most psychotherapists use a combination of uncovering and supportive approaches.

===Cognitive therapy===

[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] focuses on modifying everyday thoughts and behaviors, with the aim of positively influencing emotions.  The therapist helps clients recognise distorted thinking and learn to replace unhealthy thoughts with more realistic substitute ideas.  This approach includes [[Dialectical behavior therapy]].

===Expressive therapy===

[[Expressive therapy]] is a form of therapy that utilizes artistic expression as its core means of treating clients.  Expressive therapists use the different disciplines of the creative arts as therapuetic interventions.  This includes the modalities [[dance therapy]], [[drama therapy]],  [[art therapy]], [[music therapy]], [[writing therapy]], among others.  Expressive therapists believe that often the most effective way of treating a client is through the expression of imagination in a creative work and integrating and processing what issues are raised in the act.

=== Integrative Psychotherapy ===

[[Integrative Psychotherapy]] represents an attempt to combine ideas and strategies from more than one theoretical approach.<ref> Handbook of Psychotherapy, (Norcross&Goldried, 2005)</ref> These approaches include mixing core beliefs and combining proven techniques. Forms of integrative psychotherapy include [[Multimodal Therapy]], the [[Transtheoretical Model]], [[Cyclical Psychodynamics]], [[Systematic Treatment Selection]], [[Cognitive Analytic Therapy]]  and [[Multitheoretical Psychotherapy]]. In practice, most experienced psychotherapists develop their own integrative approach over time.

===Adaptations for children===

Counseling and psychotherapy must be adapted to meet the developmental needs of children. Many counseling preparation programs include a courses in [[human development]]. Since children often do not have the ability to articulate thoughts and feelings, counselors will use a variety of media such as crayons, paint, clay, puppets, bibliocounseling (books), toys, et cetera. The use of [[play therapy]] is often rooted in [[psychodynamics|psychodynamic theory]], but other approaches such as Solution Focused Brief Counseling may also employ the use of play in counseling. In many cases the counselor may prefer to work with the care taker of the child, especially if the child is younger than age four.  [[Theraplay]] is an approach developed to facilitate a healthier relationship between parent and child that uses structured play.  Children who have experienced chronic early maltreatment that results in [[Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]] or [[reactive attachment disorder]] can be effectively treated with [[Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy]] <ref name="bw1">Becker-Weidman. ''Treatment for Children with Trauma-Attachment Disorders: Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy'', Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal. 23(2), April 2006</ref><ref name="bw2">Becker-Weidman, A., & Shell, D., (Eds.) (2005) Creating Capacity For Attachment, Wood 'N' Barnes, OK. ISBN 1-885473-72-9</ref><ref name="bw3">Becker-Weidman, A., (2006b) Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy: a multi year follow-up. in Sturt, S., (ed) New Developments in Child Abuse Research. NY: Nova</ref>, which is an evidence-based family-based treatment approach.

==The therapeutic relationship==
Research has shown that the quality of the relationship between the therapist and the client has a greater influence on client outcomes than the specific type of psychotherapy used by the therapist (this was first suggested by Saul Rosenzweig in 1936 <ref>{{cite journal | last=Rosenzweig |first=S. | year=1936 | title=Some implicit common factors in diverse methods in psychotherapy | journal=Journal of Orthopsychiatry | volume=6 | pages=412-415}}</ref>). Accordingly, most contemporary schools of psychotherapy focus on the healing power of the therapeutic relationship.

This research is extensively discussed (with many references) in Hubble, Duncan and Miller (1999)<ref>{{cite book | title=The Heart and Soul of Change: What Works in Therapy | first=Mark A. | last=Hubble | coauthors=Barry L. Duncan and Scott D. Miller (Eds) | publisher=American Psychological Association | year=1999 | id=ISBN 1-55798-557-X}}</ref> (quotes in this section are from this book) and in Wampold (2001) <ref>{{cite book | last=Wampold | first=Bruce E. | year=2001 | title=The great psychotherapy debate | location=New Jersey | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}</ref>.

A literature review by M. J. Lambert (1992) <ref>{{cite book | last=Lambert | first=M. J. | year=1992 | chapter=Implications of outcome research for psychotherapy integration | editor=J. C. Norcross & M. R. Goldfried | title=Handbook of Psychotherapy Integration | pages=94-129}}</ref> estimated that 40% of client changes are due to extratherapeutic influences, 30% are due to the quality of the therapeutic relationship, 15% are due to expectancy (placebo) effects, and 15% are due to specific techniques. Extratherapeutic influences include client motivation and the severity of the problem:

{{quotation|For example, a withdrawn, alcoholic client, who is "dragged into therapy" by his or her spouse, possesses poor motivation for therapy, regards mental health professionals with suspicion, and harbors hostility toward others, is not nearly as likely to find relief as the client who is eager to discover how he or she has contributed to a failing marriage and expresses determination to make personal changes.}}

In one study, some highly motivated clients showed measurable improvement before their first session with the therapist, suggesting that just making the appointment can be an indicator of readiness to change. Tallman and Bohart (1999) <ref>{{cite book | last=Tallman | first=Karen | coauthors=Arthur C. Bohart | year=1999 | chapter=The Client as a Common Factor: Clients as self-healers | editor=Hubble, Duncan, Miller | title=The Heart and Soul of Change | pages=91-131}}</ref> note that:

{{quotation|Outside of therapy people rarely have a friend who will truly listen to them for more than 20 minutes (Stiles, 1995)<ref>{{cite book | last=Stiles | first=W. B. | year=1995 | chapter=Disclosure as a speech act: Is it psychotherapeutic to disclose? | editor=J. E. Pennebaker | title=Emotion, Disclosure, and Health | pages=71-92}}</ref>... Further, friends and relatives often are involved in the problem and therefore do not provide a "safe outside perspective" which may be required. Nonetheless, as noted above, people often solve their problems by talking to friends, relatives, co-workers, religious leaders, or some other confidant in their lives, or by thinking and exploring themselves.}}

===Confidentiality===
{{Further|[[client confidentiality]], and [[physician-patient privilege]]}}
Confidentiality is an integral part of the therapeutic relationship and psychotherapy in general.

==Effectiveness and criticism==

There is considerable controversy over which form of psychotherapy is most effective, and more specifically, which types of therapy are optimal for treating which sorts of problems. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/10/health/psychology/10ther.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5090&en=e6560227dc7526f7&ex=1249876800&partner=rssuserland ''For Psychotherapy's Claims, Skeptics Demand Proof''] Benedict Carey , The New York Times , August 10, 2004. Accessed  December 2006 </ref> 

Psychotherapy outcome research - in which the effectiveness of psychotherapy is measured by questionnaires given to patients before, during, and after treatment - has had difficulty distinguishing between the success or failure of the different approaches to therapy.  Not surprisingly, those who stay with their therapist for longer periods are more likely to report positively on what develops into a longer term relationship.

As early as 1952, in one of the earliest studies of psychotherapy treatment, [[Hans Eysenck]] reported that two thirds of therapy patients improved significantly or recovered on their own within two years, whether or not they received psychotherapy. <ref>{{cite book | last=Eysenck | first=Hans | year=1952 | title=The Effects of Psychotherapy: An Evaluation. Journal of Consulting Psychology | pages=16: 319-324}}</ref> 

Many psychotherapists believe that the nuances of psychotherapy cannot be captured by questionnaire-style observation, and prefer to rely on their own clinical experiences and conceptual arguments to support the type of treatment they practice.  

In 2001 Bruce Wampold, Ph.D. of the University of Wisconsin published "The Great Psychotherapy Debate" <ref>[http://www.education.wisc.edu/cp/faculty/book.htm ''The Great Psychotherapy Debate''] Bruce E. Wampold, Ph.D. University of Wisconsin-Madison . Accessed December 2006 </ref>.  In it Wampold, a former statistician studying primarily outcomes with depressed patients, reported that 
# psychotherapy can be more effective than placebo, 
# no single treatment modality has the edge in efficacy, 
# factors common to different psychotherapies, such as whether or not the therapist has established a positive working alliance with the client/patient, account for much more of the variance in outcomes than specific techniques or modalities.  

Some report that by attempting to program or manualize treatment psychotherapists may actually be reducing efficacy, although the unstructured approach of many psychotherapists cannot appeal to patients motived to solve their difficulties through the application of specific techniques different from their past "mistakes."

Critics of psychotherapy are skeptical of the healing power of a psychotherapeutic relationship.<ref>[1988. Against Therapy: Emotional Tyranny and the Myth of Psychological Healing. ISBN 0-689-11929-1], [[Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson]]</ref> Since any intervention takes time, critics note that the passage of time, without therapeutic intervention, can result in psycho-social healing despite the absence of counseling. <ref>[http://www.antipsychiatry.org/br-thdel.htm Therapy's Delusions, The Myth of the Unconscious and the Exploitation of Today's Walking Worried''] by Ethan Watters & Richard Ofshe
published by Scribner, New York, 1999 </ref> 
    
Critics note the many resources available to a person experiencing emotional distress: the friendly support of friends, peers, family members, clergy contacts, personal reading, research, and independent coping-- indicating that psychotherapy is inappropriate or unneeded by many. These critics note that humans have been dealing with crisis, navigating problems and finding solutions long before the advent of psychotherapy.<ref>[[Frank F<U+00FC>redi|F<U+00FC>redi, F.]] (2003) ''Therapy Culture: Cultivating Vulnerability in an Uncertain Age'': [[Routledge]], (ISBN 0-415-32159-X)</ref>

==Client views and concerns==
{{Original research|section|date=March 2007}}
{{weasel}}
Therapy, as with other treatment, can at times have [[iatrogenic]] effects, where problems are caused via the treatment. {{Fact|date=June 2007}} Termed 'negative outcome' by Strupp and colleagues{{Fact|date=May 2007}}, one study found that therapists with a negative self-image, or [[introject]], who adhere closely to a manualized treatment are at greater risk for negative outcomes with the people they treat {{Fact|date=May 2007}}. 

====Closeness to the therapist====
First, many clients experience very strong emotions towards their therapists. Sometimes, these are feelings of obsession, love, and/or sexual attraction (even where this goes against the client<U+2019>s normal sexuality). This can happen to anyone, including clients who are in extremely happy, loving, stable relationships with their partners, and people who are not normally highly emotional. {{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Clients are not usually forewarned about this, but it is common. Some schools of therapy refer to it as 'transference' and believe it to be emotions that are "transferred" from another person in the client's life (for example, a parent). Other schools do not see it in this way. Some schools deliberately encourage these feelings because they are seen as a key to the client 'working through' emotional issues. 

These emotions can be overpowering and have a huge effect upon the client's life. His or her other relationships can suffer. He or she can find it impossible to function normally and live for the hour per week that he or she spends with the therapist. Clients have been known to be so overwhelmed by such feelings that they experience panic attacks, breakdowns, severe depression and other traumatic effects, both during the therapy and after it has ended. The feelings can be brief but can also persist for years. {{Fact|date=May 2007}}

Therapists say that it is only in unusual cases that the feelings become that strong. They also say that staying in therapy is the best way to deal with them, and that 'working through' the feelings usually causes them to subside. But experts are now saying that it is much more common than the therapy world is prepared to admit (or indeed knows <U+2013> some clients go through all that pain without telling their therapist). It is also a phenomenon which is not really understood, and if the feelings do become unmanageable, there is little or nothing in the therapist's training to help. {{Fact|date=June 2007}}

====Dependency on therapist====
Similarly, clients often become extremely dependent upon their therapist. Clients can literally feel unable to make simple decisions without talking things through with the therapist. Some clients find that life outside of the therapy room feels insignificant and meaningless. This can have a devastating and humiliating effect on the client<U+2019>s personal, social and working life. Again, clients are not usually forewarned of this possibility, and little is known about how to prevent it or to curtail it when it happens. {{Fact|date=May 2007}}

The client<U+2019>s handle on reality can be severely affected by therapy. Some forms can encourage clients to question themselves to such an extent that they can lose a clear sense of identity, self-belief and confidence in their own judgement. Many people believe that there is a brainwashing element to therapy, sometimes even resembling a cult, and that this can override clients' normal judgement and self-sufficiency. 

Many clients, former clients, [[sociologist]]s and social commentators have warned that therapy can convince clients that their perfectly normal human feelings and behaviours are malfunctions <U+2013> signs of mental ill health, instability or 'disordered personality'. Believing oneself to be ill or not functioning adequately can be extremely upsetting, and can even become a self-fulfilling prophecy. It also seems that therapy<U+2019>s focus on the past, and/or negative experiences, and/or on the client<U+2019>s own internal world can be most unhelpful for some clients, because it surrounds them in despair when what they need might be to put the past behind them, look at positives or focus outwards. 

====Effectiveness====
Most research suggests that almost as many people (50% as opposed to 65%) feel helped by sitting in a room talking to someone generally as do when sitting in a room talking to someone who is deliberately 'doing therapy'. {{Fact|date=May 2007}}
