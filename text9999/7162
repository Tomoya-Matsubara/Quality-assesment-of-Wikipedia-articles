The '''''Codex Vigilanus (Albeldensis)''''' or '''''C<U+00F3>dice Albeldense (Vigilano)''''', full name ''Codex Conciliorum Albeldensis seu Vigilanus'', is an [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] compilation of various historical documents from the [[Visigothic]] period in [[Hispania|Spain]]. Among the many texts brought together by the compilers are the canons of the [[Councils of Toledo]], the ''[[Liber Iudiciorum]]'', the decrees of some early [[popes]] and other [[patristic]] writings, historical narratives (such as the '''''Cr<U+00F3>nica Albeldense'''''<ref>Also ''Epitome Ovetense''.</ref> and a life of [[Mohammed]]), various other pieces of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil]] and [[canon law]], and a calendar.

The compilers were three monks of the [[La Rioja (Spain)|Riojan]] monastery of [[San Mart<U+00ED>n de Albelda]]: Vigila, after whom it was named and who was the illustrator; Serracino, his friend; and Garc<U+00ED>a, his disciple. The compilation was completed in 976 and the original manuscript is preserved in the library of [[El Escorial]] (as Escorialensis d I 2). At the time of its compilation, Albelda was the cultural and intellectual centre of the [[Kingdom of Pamplona]]. The manuscripts celebrate with illustrations not only the ancient Gothic kings who had reformed the law &mdash; [[Chindasuinth]], [[Reccesuinth]], and [[Ergica]] &mdash; but also its contemporary dedicatees, the [[rulers of Navarre]]: [[Sancho II of Pamplona]] and his queen, [[Urraca Fern<U+00E1>ndez|Urraca]], and his brother [[Ramiro Garc<U+00E9>s of Viguera|Ramiro Garc<U+00E9>s]], [[King of Viguera]]. 

The ''Codex'' contains, among other pieces of useful information, the first mention and representation of [[Arabic numerals]] (save [[zero]]) in the [[Western Europe|West]]. They were introduced by the [[Moors]] into Spain around 900.

The illuminations are stylistically unique, combining [[Visigothic art|Visigothic]], [[Mozarabic]], and [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] elements. The interlace patterns and the drapery show Carolingian, as well [[Byzantine art|Italo-Byzantine]], influence.<ref>Guilmain, "Interlace," 215.</ref> The use of animals as decoration and for supporting columns also parallels contemporary Frankish usage.<ref>Guilmain, "Zoomorphic," 24.</ref> More Carolingian and less Byzantine influence is evident in the ''[[Codex Aemilianensis]]'', a copy of the ''Vigilanus'' made at [[San Mill<U+00E1>n de la Cogolla]] in 992 by a different illustrator.<ref>Guilmain, "Forgotten," 36&ndash;37.</ref>
