'''State Route 67''' ('''SR&nbsp;67''') is a [[state highway]] in [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]], [[California]]. It begins at [[Interstate 8 (California)|Interstate&nbsp;8]] (I-8) in [[El Cajon, California|El Cajon]] and continues to [[Lakeside, California|Lakeside]] as the '''San Vicente Freeway''' before becoming an [[undivided highway]] through the eastern part of [[Poway, California|Poway]]. In the town of [[Ramona, California|Ramona]], the route turns into Main Street before ending at [[State Route 78 (California)|SR&nbsp;78]]. SR&nbsp;67 provides direct access from the city of [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] to the [[East County, San Diego|East County]] region of San Diego County, including Ramona and [[Julian, California|Julian]].

The route has existed as a railroad corridor since the turn of the 20th century. A highway known as the Julian road was built by 1913, and was designated as '''Legislative Route&nbsp;198''' in the state highway system by 1935. Route&nbsp;198 was renumbered SR&nbsp;67 in the [[1964 state highway renumbering (California)|1964 state highway renumbering]]. A freeway south of Lakeside was built in the late 1960s, and opened to traffic in 1970. Since then, the portion of the highway north of Lakeside has become known for a high number of traffic accidents and related fatalities. The [[California Department of Transportation]] (Caltrans) has made several attempts to remedy the problem and make the road safer.

SR&nbsp;67 begins at [[Interstate 8|I-8]] in [[El Cajon, California|El Cajon]]; known as the San Vicente Freeway, it turns north near the [[Westfield Parkway]] shopping center. There are two [[interchange (road)|interchange]]s in the city of El Cajon: one with Broadway and Fletcher Parkway, and another with Bradley Avenue. Following this, the freeway leaves the El Cajon city limits, entering the city of [[Santee, California|Santee]] near [[Gillespie Field]], before coming to an interchange with the eastern end of [[California State Route 52|SR&nbsp;52]] in Santee. Near the Woodside Avenue exit, SR&nbsp;67 turns northeast, paralleling the [[San Diego River]] and entering the unincorporated area of [[Eucalyptus Hills, California|Eucalyptus Hills]] as it leaves the San Diego urban area. Riverford Road and Winter Gardens Boulevard have interchanges with SR 67.<ref name="tgsd" /><ref name="gmaps">{{google maps|url=https://maps.google.com/?ll=32.925707,-116.852646&spn=0.291635,0.617294&t=m&z=11|title=SR&nbsp;67|accessdate=8 November 2012}}</ref>

The freeway ends, and SR&nbsp;67 turns north and becomes an undivided highway at Mapleview Street, crossing the San Diego River and entering the town of [[Moreno, San Diego County, California|Moreno]]. SR&nbsp;67 then enters the rural area east of [[Sycamore Canyon County Open Space Preserve]] near the town of [[Foster, San Diego County, California|Foster]], passing to the west of [[San Vicente Reservoir]]. The road intersects the eastern end of Scripps Poway Parkway and [[County Route S4 (California)|County Route S4]] (CR&nbsp;S4), the latter within the [[Poway, California|Poway]] city limits. In eastern Poway, SR&nbsp;67 veers east, eventually leaving the city and entering unincorporated [[Rock Haven, California|Rock Haven]]. The road continues near [[Rosemont, California|Rosemont]] before turning northeast and becoming Julian Road and then Main Street in downtown [[Ramona, California|Ramona]]. SR&nbsp;67 ends at the intersection with [[California State Route 78|SR&nbsp;78]]; SR&nbsp;78 intersects to the northwest as Pine Street and continues northeast along Main Street towards [[Julian, California|Julian]].<ref name="tgsd">{{Cite map| publisher=Thomas Brothers| title=San Diego County Street Atlas| year=2009|pages=1152, 1171, 1172, 1191, 1211, 1212, 1231, 1232, 1251}}</ref>

The "Julian road" had been constructed by 1872, and was used for [[stagecoaches]].<ref>{{cite news | title=San Diego 75, 50, 25 Years Ago | work=The San Diego Union and Daily Bee | date=July 10, 1947 | author=Staff | page=B2 | oclc=13155544}}</ref> In 1883, ''The San Diego Union and Daily Bee'' described it as a "disgrace to the county.

===Safety concerns===
[[Image:CaliforniaRoute67b.jpg|thumb|right|SR&nbsp;67 south of Ramona]]

The highway portion of SR&nbsp;67 was popularly known as "Slaughterhouse Alley" because of the high number of fatal accidents. The road was widened in 1979 to add a shoulder and passing lane between the north end of the freeway and Poway Road. During the construction, there were concerns about speeding cars putting the construction workers in danger. The total cost was $927,000 (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US-NGDPPC|927000|1979|r=-3}}}} {{as of|2010|alt=in 2010 dollars}}), and Asphalt Inc. performed the work.<ref>{{cite news | title=State Aims to Slow Traffic During Route&nbsp;67 Job | work=The San Diego Union | date=August 21, 1979 | author=Flores, Ernesto | page=B3|oclc=13155544}}</ref>

The reputation of the highway continued into the early years of the 21st century. In 2000, a $1&nbsp;million project (about ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US-NGDPPC|1000000|2000|r=-5}}}} {{as of|2010|alt=in 2010 dollars}}) was authorized to widen the shoulders of the road, after there were 413&nbsp;accidents and 15&nbsp;fatalities on SR&nbsp;67 from 1996 to 1999. At this time, County Supervisor Dianne Jacob proposed expanding the highway portion to four lanes along the entire route.<ref>{{cite news | title=Caltrans to make Route&nbsp;67 safer by widening stop areas | work=San Diego Union-Tribune | date=January 29, 2000 | author=Arner, Mark | page=B11|oclc=25257675}}</ref> Following a safety initiative, including the involvement of law enforcement and trucking companies, accidents and fatalities both decreased by the end of 2001.<ref>{{cite news | title=Route&nbsp;67 safety effort called effective CHP says accidents and injuries decline | work=San Diego Union-Tribune | date=November 22, 2001 | author=Kreuger, Anne | page=B4|oclc=25257675}}</ref> Accidents continued, however, and by November 2008, electronic signs were installed to inform motorists of their speed, and another publicity campaign had been launched.<ref>{{cite news | title=As a safety measure, state Route&nbsp;67 gets electronic speed signs | work=San Diego Union-Tribune | date=November 22, 2008 | author=Jones, J.

In May 2009, the [[San Diego Association of Governments]] (SANDAG) announced that fixing SR&nbsp;67 was number&nbsp;17 on its priority list, resulting in an estimated 2030 completion of a four-lane highway that would not be limited-access.<ref>{{cite news | title=A poor highway, dubious statistics, more delay | work=San Diego Union-Tribune | date=May 16, 2009 | page=NC10|oclc=25257675}}</ref> A month later, Caltrans and the [[California Highway Patrol]] agreed to take more efforts to educate the public about the safety issues.<ref>{{cite news | title=2 state agencies vow help for hilly Route&nbsp;67 Caltrans, CHP to act on big safety issues | work=San Diego Union-Tribune | date=June 20, 2009 | author=Schmidt, Steve | page=B3|oclc=25257675}}</ref> Signs were installed in 2010 to encourage drivers to practice safe driving habits; from January 2007 to early December&nbsp;2010, twenty-four people died from accidents on SR&nbsp;67.<ref>{{cite news | title=Signs try to lessen the danger of State Route&nbsp;67 | work=San Diego Union-Tribune | date=December 5, 2010 | author=Scharn, Nathan | page=NIT4|oclc=25257675}}</ref> Following a March 2009 fatal crash, some of the survivors filed a lawsuit against Caltrans for negligence in maintaining and designing the highway, but the suit was decided in favor of the department.<ref>{{cite news | title=Caltrans wins suit, asks family to pay costs | work=U-T San Diego | date=18 September 2012 | author=Moran, Greg | page=A1|oclc=25257675}}</ref>
