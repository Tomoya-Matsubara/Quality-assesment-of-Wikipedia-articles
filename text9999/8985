'''David Christopherson''' (born October 5, 1954) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[politician]].  Since 2004, he has represented the [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Hamilton Centre]] in the [[Canadian House of Commons]].  He previously served in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] from 1990 to 2003, and was a [[cabinet minister]] in the provincial government of [[Bob Rae]].  Christopherson is a member of the [[New Democratic Party]].

==Early life and career==
 
Christopherson was born in [[Hamilton, Ontario]].  He is self-educated, having dropped out of [[high school]] in the ninth [[Educational stages|grade]].  A voracious reader, he is a particular fan of books on politics.  He began working with International Harvester in Hamilton at age 19, and remained with the company for eleven years.  He was active with the [[United Auto Workers]] union, becoming plant chairman in 1978 and president of the Local 525 in 1979.<ref>Jill Morrison, "Great expectations", ''Hamilton Spectator'', 13 February 1993, B3.</ref>

Christopherson campaigned in [[Hamilton East (electoral district)|Hamilton East]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1984|1984 federal election]], finishing second against [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] candidate [[Sheila Copps]].  He was elected to [[Hamilton City Council]] the following year for the city's fourth ward, and re-elected in 1988.  Christopherson became chairman of Hamilton's licencing committee, and made a concerted effort to reform the city's notorious regulatory practices.<ref>Terry Cooke, "Licensing mess could consume council term", ''Hamilton Spectator'', 10 February 2007, A19.</ref>  He developed a reputation on as a hard worker, and was one of three councillors to decline a pay increase in 1988.<ref>"3 Hamilton aldermen refuse pay raise", ''Globe and Mail'', 28 April 1988, A22.</ref>  

Christopherson was also a constituency assistant for NDP [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) [[Ian Deans]] in the mid-1980s.<ref>"Political infighting erupts in race for Deans' Hamilton riding", ''Toronto Star'', 19 January 1987, A8.</ref>  He sought the NDP nomination for [[Hamilton Mountain]] after Deans's retirement in 1986, but lost to [[Marion Dewar]].<ref>"Dewar wins Hamilton nomination", ''Globe and Mail'', 24 January 1987, A5.</ref>

==Member of Provincial Parliament==
===Government backbencher===

Christopherson was elected to the Ontario legislature in the [[Ontario general election, 1990|1990 provincial election]], defeating [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberal]] [[cabinet minister]] [[Lily Oddie Munro]] in [[Hamilton Centre]] as the NDP won a majority government across the province.  He was chair of caucus and [[parliamentary assistant]] to [[Treasurer (Ontario)|Provincial Treasurer]] [[Floyd Laughren]] from 1990 to 1992.<ref>Emilia Cassella, "Sunday shopping", ''Hamilton Spectator'', 13 May 1992, A1; Emilia Cassella, "NDP betting on optimistic projections", ''Hamilton Spectator'', 1 May 1992, A1.</ref>

===Cabinet minister===

Christopherson was respected by all parties for his legislative work ethic and contributions to the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs, and was widely considered as one of the most skilled backbenchers in the government caucus.<ref>Emilia Cassella, "Christopherson touted for NDP cabinet shuffle", ''Hamilton Spectator'', 14 August 1992, A1.</ref>  There was little surprise when he was appointed to cabinet as [[Minister of Correctional Services (Ontario)|Minister of Correctional Services]] on September 23, 1992, notwithstanding that Hamilton already had three representatives in cabinet.

Christopherson's portfolio was extremely challenging, and was described by one journalist as "one of the worst jobs in government".  The Correctional Services ministry had previously been damaged by reports of sexual abuse and intimidation involving staff at Ontario jails and training centres, and Christopherson was required to enact substantial internal reforms.<ref>Richard Mackie, "Critics brand cabinet shuffle 'damage control'", ''Globe and Mail'', 24 September 1992, A7 and "Hiring, Property and Internal Investigations", ''Hamilton Spectator'', 22 July 1993, B4.</ref>  He supported former NDP leader [[Stephen Lewis]]'s recommendations on race relations in the criminal justice system, and made efforts to address racism in Ontario prisons.<ref>"Ontario unveils policy for police race relations", ''Globe and Mail'', 6 April 1993, A12; Sean Fine, "Prison racism rampant, panel finds", ''Globe and Mail'', 2 February 1994, A5.</ref>

On February 3, 1993, Christopherson was given additional cabinet responsibilities as [[Solicitor-General (Ontario)|Solicitor-General]] of Ontario.<ref>"Rae shuffles deck", ''Hamilton Spectator'', 3 February 1993, A1.</ref>  This was also a difficult portfolio, and Christopherson has since acknowledged that relations between the Rae government and Ontario police services were extremely tense when he entered the ministry.  He has been credited with improving this situation, winning the respect of many in the police community.  [[Julian Fantino]], then an executive member of the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police, commented that there was "marked improvement" in relations following Christopherson's appointment.<ref name="Richard Brennan 1994">Richard Brennan, "Street smarts", ''Hamilton Spectator'', 28 December 1994, B3.</ref>

Christopherson allowed semi-automatic weapons to be issued to officers in late 1993.<ref>"New guns for police estimated at $17M", ''Financial Post'', 22 October 1993, p. 51.  See also "Solicitor General announces new handgun and training for police", ''Canada NewsWire'', 27 January 1994.</ref>  This was supported by many in the police service, but was criticized by some in the legal community on the grounds that the new weapons were not safer than the .38 models they replaced.<ref>Robert Sheppard, "Ready, aim and hope for the best", ''Globe and Mail'', 31 January 1994, A11.</ref>  Christopherson also introduced new guidelines for targeting [[hate crime]]s, and mandated stricter standards for police investigations of spousal assault.<ref>"Guidelines on hate crimes issued", ''Globe and Mail'', 23 July 1993, A4; "Hate crime, wife assault crackdown launched", ''Financial Post'', 20 January 1994, p. 55.</ref>  Early in 1995, he announced that police would soon be given the right to warn the general public about sex offenders released into residential neighbourhoods.<ref>"Sex offender warnings", ''Globe and Mail'', 10 February 1995, A2.</ref>

In May 1994, Christopherson introduced a pilot project to reduce illegal gun ownership in Ontario.  For a three-month period, Ontarians were permitted to turn over illegal or unwanted firearms to the police without risking prosecution for illegal possession.  The policy was endorsed by the police community.<ref>Amber Nasrulla, "Firearms amnesty launched", ''Globe and Mail'', 17 May 1994, A4 and Ross Longbottom, "Amnesty for guns way to safer streets", ''Hamilton Spectator'', 17 May 1994, B3.</ref>  After three months, the ministry announced that 1,000 pistols and revolvers, 2,000 rifles and shotguns and over 150,000 rounds of ammunition had been turned over to the police.<ref>"Success of province-wide firearms program", ''Canada NewsWire'', 1 September 1994.</ref>

In addition to his official cabinet portfolios, Christopherson was also responsible for articulating the Rae government's strategy for the proposed [[Red Hill Creek Expressway]] in Hamilton.  Although he had previously opposed the project for environmental and other reasons, Christopherson argued in 1994 that a scaled-back four-lane highway would be the "best possible compromise" under the circumstances.<ref>Emilia Cassella, "Too little, too late say PCs, Grits", ''Hamilton Spectator'', 3 March 1994, B2; Sharon Oosthoek, "Friends of valley road embrace", ''Hamilton Spectator'', 22 March 1994, B1.</ref>  The Rae government approved the plan, although it was later rejected by the succeeding ministry.

Christopherson was widely respected for his abilities in cabinet, and often won praise from members of the opposition.  [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] [[Bob Runciman]] credited him for his competence and managerial skills, while Liberal [[Tim Murphy (Canadian politician)|Tim Murphy]] described him as "the best of a bad bunch".<ref name="Richard Brennan 1994" />  He served until the defeat of the Rae government in 1995.

===Opposition member===

The Rae government was defeated in the [[Ontario general election, 1995|1995 election]], falling to only seventeen seats out of 130.  Christopherson, still personally popular, was narrowly re-elected for Hamilton Centre.  He served in the next legislature as NDP critic for labour issues and the Workers' Compensation Board.<ref>Lee Prokaska, "Critics lambast WCB cuts", ''Hamilton Spectator'', 26 July 1995, B3.</ref>

Rae resigned as party leader in 1996, and there was considerable media speculation that Christopherson would run to succeed him.  ''[[Toronto Star]]'' journalist Thomas Walkom indicated that he would be a powerful candidate on the centrist wing of the party, and would likely win the support of pro-Rae trade unions such as the Steelworkers.<ref>Thomas Walkom, "NDP needs an identity as well as a leader", ''Toronto Star'', 16 January 1996, A15.</ref>  He decided against running and gave his support to [[Howard Hampton]], the eventual winner.<ref>"Hampton to seek NDP leadership", ''Globe and Mail'', 20 February 1996, A11.</ref>

Christopherson was a prominent supporter of Hamilton's amalgamation with neighbouring municipalities in the late 1990s.<ref>"Just one MPP opposes H-W supercity", ''Hamilton Spectator'', 4 December 1996, A11.</ref>  The policy, which was supported by some members of all three major parties, was enacted by the Progressive Conservative government of [[Mike Harris]] in 2000.  Christopherson considered leaving politics to run for the leadership of the [[Ontario Federation of Labour]] in 1997, but ultimately declined.<ref>"Race for top post reveals crack in house of labour", ''Toronto Star'', 1 November 1997, p. 1.</ref>  

The Hamilton Centre riding was eliminated by redistribution in 1996, and Christopherson chose to contest the expanded riding of [[Hamilton West (electoral district)|Hamilton West]] for the [[Ontario general election, 1999|1999 provincial election]] against incumbent Progressive Conservative [[Lillian Ross (politician)|Lillian Ross]].  He was re-elected, and became one of only nine New Democrats returned to the reduced 103-seat legislature.  He served as his party's Finance and Labour Critic, and was appointed as House Leader.<ref>"Hampton announces critic portfolios", ''Canada NewsWire'', 28 June 1999, 15:14 report.</ref>  He considered campaigning for [[Mayor of Hamilton, Ontario|Mayor of Hamilton]] in 2000, but reluctantly declined.<ref>Eric Mcguinness, "Morrow throws his hat into the ring", ''Hamilton Spectator'', 31 May 2000, A01.</ref>

Christopherson resigned as NDP House Leader in 2001, amid rumours of a rift with Hampton.<ref>Richard Brennan, "Signs of rift in NDP as house leader quits", 19 April 2001, A11.</ref>  He continued to serve as his party's critic for Consumer and Business Services and the Management Board of Cabinet, and was a deputy [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]] in the legislature from 2001 to 2003.

==Mayoral campaign==

Christopherson did not seek re-election to the legislature in 2003.  He instead campaigned for mayor of Hamilton in that year's municipal campaign.  He promised to reform the city's disclosure laws, requiring municipal politicians to declare their assets, debts and holdings.<ref>Chinta Puxley, "Mayoral hopeful pushes disclosure rule", ''Hamilton Spectator'', 16 June 2003.</ref>  He also spoke out against plans to build an incinerator in the city for waste disposal.<ref>Fred Vallance-Jones, "Incinerator fuels mayoral clash", ''Hamilton Spectator'', 8 September 2003, A04.</ref>  He was supported by two teachers' unions and the city firefighters' union, as well as by Liberal MPP [[Dominic Agostino]] from [[Hamilton East (electoral district)|Hamilton East]].  Initially considered the frontrunner, he was ultimately defeated by rival candidate [[Larry Di Ianni]].  Hamilton's amalgamation with the more right-leaning suburbs was a factor, as was Christopherson's opposition to a revised Red Hill Expressway.<ref>"Expressway dispute", ''Broadcast News'', 12 November 2003, 03:24 report.</ref>

==Federal politician==
{{wikinews|CanadaVOTES: NDP incumbent David Christopherson running in Hamilton Centre}}
Christopherson returned to political life a few months later, defeating [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] cabinet minister [[Stan Keyes]] to win the [[Hamilton Centre]] riding in the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]].  The Liberal Party won a minority government, and Christopherson served as NDP critic for cities, community infrastructure, labour and steel policy in the [[38th Canadian parliament|38th parliament]].  He was part of a Canadian delegation that observed presidential elections in [[Ukraine]] in late 2004.<ref>"Hamilton New Democrat M-P David Christopherson is heading to Ukraine for Christmas", ''Broadcast News'', 17 December 2004, 03:58 report.</ref>  

He was re-elected in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]] with an increased majority, as the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] won a minority government nationally.  In May 2006, he called for the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] rather than the government to investigate a leak of the [[Auditor General of Canada|Auditor General]]'s report into the [[Canadian gun registry]].  Christopherson suspected that someone connected to the government may have been responsible for the leak, given its "self-serving" nature.<ref>"Who leaked Fraser's report? Harper to probe", ''Winnipeg Free Press'', 13 May 2006, A11.</ref>  He has also criticized the previous Liberal government for allowing billions in unpaid tax monies to remain uncollected.<ref>Carly Weeks, "Agency lets billions in tax money slip away: Problems reported in 1994 never fixed", ''Ottawa Citizen'', 17 May 2006, A5.</ref>

Christopherson was re-elected to his federal seat again in the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 federal election]].

Christopherson is often described as a pragmatic politician.  He once said that he has never been a "hard-line ideologue", but "the NDP is where I'm most comfortable."<ref name="Richard Brennan 1994" />
