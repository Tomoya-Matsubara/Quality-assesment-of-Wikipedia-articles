'''''Myst''''' is a [[graphic adventure game|graphic adventure]] [[video game]] designed and directed by the brothers [[Robyn Miller|Robyn]] and [[Rand Miller]]. It was developed by [[Cyan, Inc.|Cyan]] (now Cyan Worlds), a [[Spokane, Washington]]-based studio, and [[video game publisher|published]] and distributed by [[Br<U+00F8>derbund]]. The Millers began working on ''Myst'' in {{vgy|1991}} and released it for the [[Macintosh]] computer on September 24, 1993; it was developer Cyan's largest project to date. Remakes and [[porting|ports]] of the game have been released for [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Atari Jaguar CD|Jaguar CD]], [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]], [[CD-i]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[AmigaOS]], [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]], [[Nintendo DS]], and [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] by publishers [[Midway Games]], [[Sunsoft]], and [[Mean Hamster Software]].

''Myst'' puts the player in the role of the [[Characters of Myst|Stranger]], who uses a special book to travel to the island of Myst. There, the player uses other special books written by an artisan and explorer named [[Characters of Myst#Atrus|Atrus]] to travel to several worlds known as "Ages". Clues found in each of these Ages help reveal the back-story of the game's characters. The game has several endings, depending on the course of action the player takes.

Upon release, ''Myst'' was a surprise hit, with critics lauding the ability of the game to immerse players in the fictional world. The game was the [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling PC game]] of all time, until ''[[The Sims]]'' exceeded its sales in {{vgy|2002}}.<ref name="best-selling">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/simslivinlarge/news_2857556.html |title=The Sims overtakes Myst |accessdate=2008-03-17 |author=Walker, Trey |date=2002-03-22 |publisher=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> ''Myst'' helped drive adoption of the then-nascent [[CD-ROM]] format. ''Myst''{{'}}s success spawned four direct video game sequels as well as several spin-off games and novels.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Myst-library and ship.jpg|thumb|left|Screenshot of ''Myst'', showing the island's library in the background and part of a puzzle involving a ship in the foreground|Screenshot of ''Myst'', showing the island's library in the background and a puzzle involving a ship in the foreground]]

The gameplay of ''Myst'' consists of a [[first-person narrative|first-person]] journey through an interactive world. The player moves the character by clicking on locations shown in the main display; the scene then crossfades into another frame, and the player can continue to explore. Players can interact with specific objects on some screens by [[Point-and-click|click]]ing or dragging them.<ref>{{cite book|title=Myst User Manual|publisher=[[Br<U+00F8>derbund]]|year=1993|edition=[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version|pages=5<U+2013>6|series="Manipulating Objects"}}</ref> To assist in rapidly crossing areas already explored, ''Myst'' has an optional "Zip" feature. When a lightning bolt cursor appears, players can click and skip several frames to another location. While this provides a rapid method of travel, it can also cause players to miss important items and clues.<ref>{{cite book|title=Myst User Manual|publisher=[[Br<U+00F8>derbund]]|year=1993|edition=[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version|pages=9|series="Zip Mode"}}</ref> Some items can be carried by the player and read, including journal pages which provide [[Back-story|backstory]]. Players can only carry a single page at a time, and pages return to their original locations when dropped.<ref>{{cite book|title=Myst User Manual|publisher=[[Br<U+00F8>derbund]]|year=1993|edition=[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version|pages=13|series="Options Menu"}}</ref>

To complete the game, the player must explore the seemingly deserted island of Myst.<ref name="guerillas">{{cite journal|author=Carroll, John|year=1994|month=August|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.08/myst_pr.html|title=Guerrillas in the Myst|journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|volume=2|issue=8}}</ref> There the player discovers and follows clues to be transported via "linking books" to several "Ages", each of which is a self-contained mini-world. Each Age<U+2014>named Selenitic, Stoneship, Mechanical, and Channelwood<U+2014>requires the user to solve a series of logical, interrelated puzzles to complete its exploration. Objects and information discovered in one Age may be required to solve puzzles in another Age, or to complete the game's primary puzzle on Myst. For example, in order to activate a switch, players must first open a safe and use the matches found within to start a boiler.<ref name="mysty"/>

Apart from its predominantly nonverbal storytelling,<ref name="mysty"/> ''Myst''{{'}}s gameplay is unusual among adventuring computer games in several ways. The player is provided with very little backstory at the beginning of the game, and no obvious goals or objectives are laid out. This means that players must simply begin to explore. There are no obvious enemies, [[nonviolent video game|no physical violence]], and no threat of "dying" at any point,<ref name="guerillas"/> although it is possible to reach a few "losing" endings. There is no time limit to complete the game.<ref name="guerillas"/> The game unfolds at its own pace and is solved through a combination of patience, observation, and logical thinking.<ref name="mysty"/>

==Plot==
The game's instruction manual explains that an unnamed person known as the [[Characters of Myst#The Stranger|Stranger]] stumbles across an unusual book titled "Myst". The Stranger reads the book and discovers a detailed description of an island world. Placing his hand on the last page, the Stranger is whisked away to the world described, and is left with no choice but to explore;<ref>{{cite book|title=Myst User Manual|publisher=[[Br<U+00F8>derbund]]|year=1993|edition=[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version|pages=2|series=}}</ref> the player then gains control and is allowed to wander the new surroundings.

Myst, the island world described in the book, contains a library where two additional books can be found, colored red and blue. These books are traps which hold [[Characters of Myst#Sirrus and Achenar|Sirrus and Achenar]], the sons of [[Characters of Myst#Atrus|Atrus]], who lives on Myst island with his wife Catherine. Atrus uses an ancient practice to write special "linking books", which transport people to the worlds, or "Ages", that the books describe. From the panels of their books, Sirrus and Achenar tell the Stranger that Atrus is dead, each claiming that the other brother murdered him, and plead for the Stranger to help them escape. However, the books are missing several pages, so the sons' messages are at first unclear, and riddled with static.

As the Stranger continues to explore the island, more books are discovered hidden behind complex mechanisms and puzzles. There are four books in total, each linking to a different Age. The Stranger must visit each Age, find the red and blue pages hidden there, and then return to Myst Island. These pages can then be placed in the corresponding books. As the Stranger adds more pages to these books, the brothers can speak more and more clearly. Throughout this process, each brother maintains that the other brother cannot be trusted. After collecting four pages, the brothers can talk clearly enough to tell the Stranger where the fifth page is hidden. If the Stranger gives either brother their fifth page, they will be free. The Stranger is left with a choice to help Sirrus, Achenar, or neither.<ref name="myst-game guide">{{cite web|author=Poole, Stephen|date=|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/myst_gg/index.html|title=Myst Game Guide|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2009-02-08}}</ref>

Both brothers beg the Stranger not to touch the green book that is stored in the same location as their last pages. They claim that it is a book like their own that will trap the Stranger. In truth, it leads to D'ni, where Atrus is imprisoned. When the book is opened, Atrus asks the Stranger to bring him a final page that is hidden on Myst Island; without it, he cannot bring his sons to justice.

The game has several endings, depending on the player's actions. Giving either Sirrus or Achenar the final page of their book causes the Stranger to switch places with the son, leaving the player trapped inside the Prison book. Linking to D'ni without the page Atrus asks for leaves both the Stranger and Atrus trapped on D'ni. Linking to D'ni with the page allows Atrus to complete his Myst book and return to the island.<ref name="myst-game guide"/> Upon returning to the library, the red and blue books are gone, and there are burn marks on the shelves where they used to be.

{{quote box|width=40%|quote= "We started our design work and realized that we would need to have even more story and history than would be revealed in the game itself. It seemed having that depth was just as important as what the explorer would actually see."|source= Rand Miller on developing ''Myst''{{'}}s fictional history<ref name="through the myst"/>}}

The ''Myst'' creative team consisted of the brothers Rand and Robyn Miller, with help from sound designer Chris Brandkamp, 3D artist and animator, Chuck Carter, Richard Watson, Bonnie McDowall, and [[Ryan Miller (author)|Ryan Miller]], who together made up [[Cyan Worlds|Cyan, Inc.]] The company had previously only made children's games. ''Myst'' was conceived by the brothers as a challenging but aesthetically simple game that would appeal to adults;<ref name="guerillas"/> ''Myst'' was not only the largest collaboration Cyan had attempted at the time, but also took the longest to develop.<ref>{{cite book|title=Myst User Manual|publisher=[[Br<U+00F8>derbund]]|author=[[Cyan Worlds|Cyan, Inc.]]|year=1993|edition=[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version|pages=15|series="About the Authors"}}</ref> According to Rand Miller, the brothers spent months solely designing the look and puzzles of the Ages,<ref name="myst-making of myst">{{cite video|people=Miller, Rand and Robyn; Cyan|date=1993|title=The Making of Myst| publisher=Cyan, Inc./Br<U+00F8>derbund|medium=CD-ROM|format=[[QuickTime#File formats|.MOV]]}}</ref> which were influenced by earlier whimsical "worlds" made for children.<ref name="through the myst">{{cite web|author=Stern, Gloria|date=1994-08-23|url=http://www2.worldvillage.com/wv/gamezone/html/reviews/myst.htm|title=Through the Myst|publisher=WorldVillage.com|accessdate=2008-05-02}}</ref> According to the creators, the game's name, as well as the overall solitary and mysterious atmosphere of the island, was inspired by the book ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' by [[Jules Verne]].<ref name="guerillas"/>

At first, the developers had no idea how they would actually create the physical terrain for the Ages.<ref name="making of myst">{{cite video|people=Miller Bros., Cyan, &c|date=1993|title=The Making of Myst| publisher=[[Cyan Worlds|Cyan, Inc.]]/[[Br<U+00F8>derbund]]| url=http://www.nwe.ufl.edu/~tharpold/resources/myst/making_of_myst.html| medium|[[CD-ROM]]|format=[[QuickTime#File formats|.MOV]]}}</ref> Eventually, they created grayscale [[heightmap]]s, extruding them to create changes in elevation. From this basic terrain, textures were painted onto a colormap which was wrapped over the landscapes. Objects such as trees were added to complete the design.<ref name="making of myst"/> Rand noted that attention to detail allowed ''Myst'' to deal with the limitations of CD-ROM drives and graphics, stating "A lot can be done with texture<U+2026>Like finding an interesting texture you can map into the tapestry on the wall, spending a little extra time to actually put the bumps on the tapestry, putting screws in things. These are the things you don't necessarily notice, but if they weren't there, would flag to your subconscious that this is fake."<ref>{{cite journal|author=Gillen, Marilyn|title=Interactive Gamers Try to Follow Enveloping 'Myst'|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|volume=1|date=1994-07-09|pages=100}}</ref>

The game was created on [[Macintosh]] computers, principally [[Macintosh Quadra]]s. The graphics were individual shots of fully rendered rooms. Overall, ''Myst'' contains 2,500&nbsp;frames, one for each possible area the player can explore.<ref name="making of myst"/> Each scene was modeled and rendered in [[StrataVision 3D]], with some additional modeling in [[Macromedia]] MacroModel.<ref name="making of myst"/> The images were then edited and enhanced using [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]&nbsp;1.0.<ref name="making of myst"/>

The original Macintosh version of ''Myst'' was constructed in [[HyperCard]].  Each Age was a unique [[HyperCard]] stack. Navigation was handled by the internal button system and [[HyperTalk]] scripts, with image and [[QuickTime]] movie display passed off to various plugins; essentially, ''Myst'' functions as a series of separate multimedia slides linked together by commands.<ref name="1up"/> As the main technical constraint that impacted ''Myst'' was slow [[CD-ROM]] drive read speeds, Cyan had to go to great lengths to make sure all the game elements loaded as quickly as possible.<ref name="through the myst"/> Images were stored as 8-bit [[PICT]] resources with custom color palettes and QuickTime still image compression.<ref name="making of myst"/>  Animated elements such as movies and object animations were encoded as QuickTime movies with [[Cinepak]] compression;<ref name="making of myst"/> in total, there were more than 66&nbsp;minutes of Quicktime animation.<ref name="making of myst"/> This careful processing made the finished graphics look like [[truecolor]] images despite their low bit depth; the stills were reduced in size from 500&nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] to around 80&nbsp;KB.<ref name="making of myst"/>

===Audio===
{{main|Myst: Soundtrack}}
Chris Brandkamp produced most of the [[Ambient noise level|ambient]] and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp had to wait until the game's visuals were placed in context.<ref name="making of myst"/> Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning.<ref name="guerillas"/> The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.<ref name="making of myst"/>

At first, ''Myst'' had no music, because the Millers did not want music to interfere with the gameplay.<ref name="making of myst"/> After a few tests, they realized that the background music did not adversely affect the game and, in fact, "seemed to really help the mood of certain places that you were at in the game."<ref name="making of myst"/> Robyn Miller ended up composing 40 minutes of [[Synthesizer|synthesized]] music that was used in the game and later published as ''Myst: The Soundtrack''.<ref name="making of myst"/> Initially, Cyan released the soundtrack via a mail-order service, but before the release of ''Myst''{{'}}s sequel, ''[[Riven]]'', [[Virgin Records]] acquired the rights to releasing the soundtrack,<ref name="denver post-sound">{{cite news|author=Thomas, David|date=1998-05-08|title=Mastermind of Myst, Riven also has a talent for music|publisher=[[The Denver Post]]}}</ref> and the CD was rereleased on April 21, 1998.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|last=Sheridan|first=Tim|title=Myst: The Sequel to Myst|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:kxfwxqyjldfe|accessdate=2010-01-13}}</ref>

''Myst'' was commercially successful on release.

''Myst'' was generally praised by critics. ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that ''Myst'' was evidence that video games could in fact evolve into an art form.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rothstein, Edward|date=1994-12-04|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E7DD1030F937A35751C1A962958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1|title=A New Art Form May Arise From the 'Myst'|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-03-12}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reported that some players considered ''Myst''{{'}}s "virtual morality" a religious experience.<ref>{{cite web|author=Daly, Steve|date=1994-10-07|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,303937,00.html|title=The Land of 'Myst' Opportunity|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2008-05-02}}</ref> [[Aarhus University]] professor S<U+00F8>ren Pold pointed to ''Myst'' as an excellent example of how stories can be told using objects rather than people.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pold, S<U+00F8>ren|url=http://imv.au.dk/~pold/publikat/writcode.htm|title=Writing With the Code - a Digital Poetics|publisher=[[Aarhus University]]|accessdate=2008-04-15}}</ref> Laura Evenson, writing for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', pointed to adult-oriented games like ''Myst'' as evidence the video game industry was emerging from its "adolescent" phase.<ref>{{cite news|author=Evenson, Laura|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|title=Interactive CD-ROMs come of age|date=1994-12-22|page=DAT36}}</ref>

Some aspects of the game still received criticism. Several publications did not agree with the positive reception of the story; Jeremy Parrish of [[1UP.com]] noted that while ''Myst''{{'}}s lack of interaction and continual plot suited the game, it helped usher in the death of the adventure game genre.<ref name="1up">{{cite web|author=Parrish, Jeremy|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3134600|title=When SCUMM Ruled the Earth|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=2008-05-02}}</ref> ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' stated the main flaw with the game was that the game engine was nowhere near as sophisticated as the graphics.<ref name="Edge-Review(Mac)">

===Legacy===
In addition to the numerous remakes and ports of the game, ''Myst''{{'}}s success led to several sequels. ''[[Riven]]'' was released on October 29, 1997, in which Atrus asks the Stranger to return to help him rescue his wife from [[Characters of Myst#Gehn|Gehn]]. ''[[Myst III: Exile]]'' was released simultaneously for Macintosh and Windows systems in North America on May 7, 2001, and was later ported to the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox]] consoles. ''Exile'' was not developed by Cyan; [[Presto Studios]] developed the title and [[Ubisoft]] published it.<ref>{{cite web|date=2001-04-05|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/093/093192p1.html|title=News Briefs: Halo rumors fly, Tribes 2 event on Saturday, and no TF2 at E3?|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-05-03}}</ref> Taking place 10&nbsp;years after the events of ''Riven'', ''Exile'' reveals the reasons for Atrus' sons being imprisoned and the disastrous effects their greed caused.<ref>{{cite web|date=2001-05-02|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/094/094134p1.html|title=New Myst III Trailer|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-04-12}}</ref> The fourth entry in the series, ''[[Myst IV: Revelation]]'', was released on September 10, 2004, and was developed and published entirely by Ubisoft.

==Rereleases and ports==
''Myst''{{'}}s success led to the game being ported to multiple platforms, including the [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Atari Jaguar CD|Jaguar CD]], [[AmigaOS]], [[CD-i]], and [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]] consoles. The video game was also remade or ported to next generation consoles and handhelds, as well as rereleased in new editions for the PC.

===PC remakes===

''Myst: Masterpiece Edition'' was an updated version of the original ''Myst'', released in May 2000. It featured several improvements over the original game, with the images re-rendered in 24-bit [[truecolor]] instead of the original ''Myst''{{'}}s 8-bit color. The score was re-mastered and sound effects were enhanced, and some cinematics were redone.<ref name="masterpiece">{{cite web|url=http://www.ubi.com/US/Games/Info.aspx?pId=196|year=2000|publisher=[[Ubisoft]]|title=Myst: Masterpiece Edition|accessdate=2008-05-02}}</ref>

''realMyst: Interactive 3D Edition'' was a remake of ''Myst'' released in November 2000 for Windows PCs, and in January 2002 for Mac. Unlike ''Myst'' and the ''Masterpiece Edition'', ''realMyst'' featured free-roaming, real-time 3D graphics instead of pre-rendered stills.<ref name="real myst go">{{cite web|author=Walker, Trey|date=2000-10-20|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/realmyst/news.html?sid=2643165&mode=recent|title=Real Myst Shipping in Early November|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-05-07}}</ref> Weather effects like thunderstorms, sunsets, and sunrises were added to the Ages, and minor additions were made to keep the game in sync with the story of the ''Myst'' novels and sequels. The game also added a new Age called Rime, which is featured in an extended ending.<ref name="real myst go"/> ''realMyst'' was developed by Cyan, Inc. and [[Sunsoft]], and published by [[Ubisoft]].  While the new interactivity of the game was praised, ''realMyst'' ran extremely slowly on most computers of the time.<ref>{{cite web|date=2000-11-13|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/165/165612p1.html|title=RealMyst Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-04-29}}</ref>

In November 2005, [[Midway Games]] announced that they would be developing a remake of ''Myst'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]].

A version of ''Myst'' for the [[Nintendo DS]] was also released in December 2007. The version features re-mastered video and audio, using [[source code]] specifically re-written for the Nintendo DS. The remake features [[Ages of Myst#Rime|Rime]] as a playable Age, with an all new graphic set.<ref name="myst ds">{{cite web |author=Purchese, Rob|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=77459 |title=Myst heads to DS |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2007-06-07 |accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref>  ''Myst DS'' was released in North America on May 13, 2008.
