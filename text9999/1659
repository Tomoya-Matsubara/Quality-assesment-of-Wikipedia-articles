'''Harry Alvin Millis''' (May 14, 1873 <U+2014> June 25, 1948) was an [[United States|American]] [[Civil service|civil servant]], [[economist]], and educator and  who was prominent in the first four decades of the 20th century. He was a prominent educator,<ref name="Obit">"Dr. H.A. Millis Dies," ''New York Times,.'' June 26, 1948.</ref> and his writings on labor relations were described at his death by several prominent economists as "landmarks".<ref name="Brown745">Brown, et al., "Harry Alvin Millis, 1873-1948," ''American Economic Review,'' June 1949, p. 745.</ref> Millis is best known for serving on the "first" [[National Labor Relations Board]], an executive-branch agency which had no statutory authority.<ref>Morris, ''The Blue Eagle at Work,'' 2004, p. 21.</ref> He was also the second chairman of the "second" National Labor Relations Board, where he initiated a number of procedural improvements and helped stabilize the Board's enforcement of American labor law.<ref name="Obit" /><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,856110,00.html#ixzz14oHYDLKD "Milestones" ''Time,'' July 5, 1948.]</ref>

==Early life==

From 1899 to 1902 he was reference librarian at the [[John Crerar Library]], a then-independent, privately-owned public library focusing on research and teaching in science, medicine, and technology.<ref name="PersonalNotes" /> In 1901, he married the former Alice May Schoff.<ref name="Current">''Current Biography,'' 1940, p. 586.</ref> The couple had three children: a son, John, and two daughters, Savilla and Charlotte.<ref name="Current" /> She had received her [[Bachelor of Laws]] from the [[University of Cincinatti]] and her [[Master of Philosophy]] from the [[University of Michigan]].<ref>''The Michigan Alumnus,'' 1955, p. 34.</ref> He left his position at Crerar Library in 1902 to become professor of economics and sociology at the [[University of Arkansas]].<ref name="PersonalNotes" /><ref name="Brown743" /><ref name="WPObit">"Millis, NLRB Ex-Chairman, Dies in Chicago," ''Washington Post,'' June 26, 1948.</ref> He taught there for only two years.

Leland]], Dean of the College of Liberal Arts at [[Northwestern University]] and chair of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]], later said it was a landmark in the study of state tax issues and anticipated the later, better known work by Seligman and Adams.<ref name="Brown745" />

He left Stanford in 1911 and in the fall of 1912 joined the economics department at the [[University of Kansas]], where he was appointed head of the department in 1928.<ref name="Nilan17" /><ref name="Notes" /><ref name="Edwards" /><ref>"New Teachers," ''The Graduate Magazine of the University of Kansas,'' October 1912, p. 12.</ref>

He joined the Department of Economics at the University of Chicago in the fall of 1916 as an assistant professor of economics.<ref name="Brown743" /><ref name="Nilan17" /><ref name="Notes" /> He was appointed chair of the department in 1928, and became Professor Emeritus in 1938 at the age of 65.<ref name="Brown743" /><ref name="WPObit" /> He became associated with the "[[institutional economics]]" school, whose foremost proponents were then primarily teaching at the University of Chicago.<ref>van Overtveldt, ''The Chicago School: How the University of Chicago Assembled the Thinkers Who Revolutionized Economics and Business,'' 2007, p. 128.</ref> Between 1938 and 1945, he and Royal E. Montgomery of [[Cornell University]] co-wrote a three-volume study titled ''The Economics of Labor.'' At the time of his death, a group of prominent economists called it "the most authoritative and comprehensive analysis of modern labor economics for the period covered."<ref name="Brown745" /> He followed this with ''How Collective Bargaining Works'' in 1942, a text which set the pattern for [[Case study|case studies]] in the field.<ref name="Brown745" />

==Public service==
Millis was a firm believer in "practical" economics and labor relations, the idea that an academic should not merely study from afar but should actively participate in the practice of his or her subjects. Accordingly, Millis agreed to serve on a number of public boards, commissions, and agencies throughout his life. He served as a staff economist and field investigator for the [[Dillingham Commission|United States Immigration Commission]] from 1908 to 1910, studying Asian immigration on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in the [[Mountain States|Rocky Mountain states]] and authoring a three-volume report on the issue.<ref name="WPObit" /><ref name="Brown743744">Brown, et al., "Harry Alvin Millis, 1873-1948," ''American Economic Review,'' June 1949, p. 743-744.</ref><ref name="RooseveltSetsUp">"Roosevelt Sets Up a New Labor Board," ''New York Times,'' July 1, 1934.</ref><ref name="GrossMaking7576">Gross, ''The Making of the National Labor Relations Board: A Study in Economics, Politics, and the Law, 1933-1937,'' 1974, p. 75-76.</ref> He was director of the Illinois Health Insurance Commission from 1918 to 1919, where he oversaw the first large-scale effort to collect health statistics, assess the health of the citizenry, study the implementation of health laws, and make policy recommendations regarding health insurance.<ref name="WPObit" /><ref name="Brown743744" /><ref name="RooseveltSetsUp" />

From 1919 to 1921, he was chairman of the Trade Board of the Chicago Men's Clothing Industry, where he helped mediate labor disputes in the textile industry.<ref name="Brown743744" /><ref name="RooseveltSetsUp" /><ref name="Wolman">Wolman, Wander, Mack, and Herwitz, ''The Clothing Workers of Chicago, 1910-1922,'' 1922, p. 193.</ref> He was chairman of the Trade Board's Arbitration Committee from 1923 to 1924 and again from 1937 to 1940.<ref name="Brown743744" /><ref name="RooseveltSetsUp" /><ref name="Wolman" /><ref>Morris, ''Labor and Management,'' 1973, p. 126.</ref>

==="First" NLRB===
In 1934, Millis was named a member of the "first" National Labor Relations Board. On June 16, 1933, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA) into law. Title I, Section 7(a) of the Act guaranteed the right of workers to form unions, and it set off a massive wave of union organizing punctuated by employer and union violence, [[general strike]]s, and [[recognition strike]]s.<ref>Bernstein, ''The Turbulent Years: A History of the American Worker, 1933-1941,'' 1970, p. 170-72; Dubofsky and Dulles, ''Labor in America: A History,'' 1999, p. 252-258.</ref> Although it was felt Section 7(a) would be self-policing, that assumption failed almost immediately.<ref name="Morris25">Morris, ''The Blue Eagle at Work,'' 2004, p. 25.</ref> On August 5, 1933, President Roosevelt announced that the [[National Recovery Administration]] was being instructed to establish a [[National Labor Board]] (NLB) to administer Section 7(a).<ref name="Morris25" /> (Millis served as the vice-chair of the NLB's Chicago office.)<ref name="GrossMaking7475">Gross, ''The Making of the National Labor Relations Board: A Study in Economics, Politics, and the Law, 1933-1937,'' 1974, p. 74-75.</ref> But the NLB provded ineffective without any statutory or regulatory powers, so Roosevelt issued [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 6511 on December 16, 1933, to strengthen the NLB and give it the forced of executive authority.<ref>Gross, ''The Making of the National Labor Relations Board: A Study in Economics, Politics, and the Law, 1933-1937,'' 1974, p. 42.</ref> But this, too, proved too little to deal with the tremendous labor relations problems facing the country. Finally, threatened with a major strike in the steel industry and a Senate labor relations bill moving forward without presidential input, Roosevelt personally drafted Public Resolution No. 44, a bill which authorized the president to create one or more new labor boards to enforce Section 7(a) by conducting investigations, subpoenaeing evidence and witnesses, holding elections and issuing orders.<ref name="Morris47">Morris, ''The Blue Eagle at Work,'' 2004, p. 25.</ref><ref>Finegold and Skocpol, ''State and Party in America's New Deal,'' 1995, p. 130.</ref> It passed both houses of Congress on June 16, and Roosevelt signed it into law on June 19, 1934.<ref name="Morris47" /> Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6073 on June 29, 1934, which abolished the NLB and established the National Labor Relations Board.<ref name="RooseveltSetsUp" /><ref name="Tomlins127128">Tomlins, ''The State and the Unions: Labor Relations, Law, and the Organized Labor Movement in America, 1880-1960,'' 1985, p. 127-128.</ref> The three-person board was empowered to hold hearings and make findings of fact, investigate violations of Section 7(a), and hold union organizing elections to resolve labor disputes.<ref name="Tomlins127128" /> Millis expressed no interest in serving on the NLRB.<ref>Tomlins, ''The State and the Unions: Labor Relations, Law, and the Organized Labor Movement in America, 1880-1960,'' 1985, p. 150-151.</ref> Nontheless, he was asked to join the new board based on his national reputation as an arbitrator, and agreed to do so.<ref name="GrossMaking7475" /> Millis was sworn in as a member of the "first" NLRB on July 9, 1934.<ref>"New Labor Board Starts Its Work," ''New York Times,'' July 10, 1934.</ref><ref>Tomlins, ''The State and the Unions: Labor Relations, Law, and the Organized Labor Movement in America, 1880-1960,'' 1985, p. 127.</ref>

Millis played a role in keeping the "first NLRB" independent. The NRLB's chairman, 36-year-old [[Lloyd K. Garrison]], had agreed to serve as the chair only to get the board up and running, and he resigned on October 2, 1934, to resume his position as acting dean of the [[University of Wisconsin Law School]].<ref>"Frank Says Garrison Will Return As Dean," ''New York Times,'' September 16, 1934; "Garrison Resigns Labor Board Post," ''New York Times,'' October 3, 1934; Gross, ''The Making of the National Labor Relations Board: A Study in Economics, Politics, and the Law, 1933-1937,'' 1974, p. 99.</ref> Garrison suggested as his replacement a long-time friend, [[Francis Biddle]], a prominent [[Philadelphia]] attorney.<ref>Gross, ''The Making of the National Labor Relations Board: A Study in Economics, Politics, and the Law, 1933-1937,'' 1974, p. 99-100.</ref> Biddle was appointed to the post on November 16.<ref>"F.B. Biddle Named Labor Board Head," ''New York Times,'' November 17, 1934.</ref> [[United States Secretary of Labor|Secretary of Labor]] [[Frances Perkins]], however, had long sought to assert her department's control over the NLRB, but Garrison and Perkins came to an informal agreement which preserved the NLRB's independence.<ref>Gross, ''The Making of the National Labor Relations Board: A Study in Economics, Politics, and the Law, 1933-1937,'' 1974, p. 104-105.</ref> With Garrison's departure, however, Perkins sought to abrogate this agreement. She secretly met with President Roosevelt and secured changes to the executive order appointing Biddle to the NLRB which placed the agency completely under her control.<ref name="GrossMaking106">Gross, ''The Making of the National Labor Relations Board: A Study in Economics, Politics, and the Law, 1933-1937,'' 1974, p. 106.</ref> Millis learned of the content of the executive order and alerted Biddle.<ref name="GrossMaking106" /> Biddle confronted Perkins hours before his swearing-in, and Perkins agreed to hold the order in abeyance until she, Biddle, and the president could meet.<ref name="GrossMaking106" /> Roosevelt later agreed that his order had been inappropriate, and agreed that while he would not rescind the order he would also not permit it to be enforced (personally guaranteeing the NLRB's independence).<ref name="GrossMaking106" /> Millis deeply impressed his colleagues on the NLRB. Garrison called him immensely experienced, with excellent judgment and common sense.<ref>Gross, ''The Making of the National Labor Relations Board: A Study in Economics, Politics, and the Law, 1933-1937,'' 1974, p. 109.</ref> Biddle said Millis educated him about the history of the labor movement, and called him cautious, thoughtful, wise, and cheerful.<ref name="GrossMaking110">Gross, ''The Making of the National Labor Relations Board: A Study in Economics, Politics, and the Law, 1933-1937,'' 1974, p. 110.</ref> Millis, he said, was ""profoundly conscious of the injustices that had been done labor's attempt to organize, although at the same time aware of the dangerous weaknesses in a good deal of labor leadership: not only the racketeering and the feather-bedding, but the lack of imagination, the insistence on improved wages and hours as the sole end, the petty jurisdictional jealousies and squabbles..."<ref name="GrossMaking110" />

Millis played a major role in keeping the NLRB's jurisdiction as well. On June 18, 1934, the National Labor Board asserted jurisdiction over a labor dispute at the ''[[San Francisco Call|Call-Bulletin]]'', a newspaper in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].<ref name="GrossMaking109">Gross, ''The Making of the National Labor Relations Board: A Study in Economics, Politics, and the Law, 1933-1937,'' 1974, p. 109.</ref> Although the National Labor Board was disbanded two weeks later, but the "first NLRB" asserted continued jurisdiction over the dispute.<ref name="GrossMaking109" /> At a hearing in Washington, D.C., on November 13, 1934, counsel for the newspaper asserted that NIRA gave exclusive jurisdiction over all newspaper industry labor disputes to the Newspaper Industrial Board (NIB).<ref name="GrossMaking109" /> The NIB was a body established by the Code of Fair Competition for the Daily Newspaper Publishing Business, a "fair trade" code established under the authority of NIRA and approved by President Roosevelt.<ref name="GrossMaking109" /> If the NLRB bowed to the newspaper's interpretation, it would be essentially giving up all of its authority to the National Recovery Administration (NRA), with which it was already locked in a jurisdictional struggle.  Instead, the NLRB decided to challenge the NRA's claim of authority over all labor disputes in industries covered by NIRA codes.<ref>Gross, ''The Making of the National Labor Relations Board: A Study in Economics, Politics, and the Law, 1933-1937,'' 1974, p. 110.</ref> On December 3, 1934, Millis and the other NLRB members issued a public statement declaring that NIRA granted NRA no exclusive jurisdiction over labor disputes, and pointing out that since the NIB had deadlocked on all major issues before it the NLRB would step in.<ref>Gross, ''The Making of the National Labor Relations Board: A Study in Economics, Politics, and the Law, 1933-1937,'' 1974, p. 111.</ref> NRA chief counsel [[Donald Richberg]]  angrily supported the NIB and the newspaper industry, and challenged the NLRB's jurisdictional claim.<ref>Gross, ''The Making of the National Labor Relations Board: A Study in Economics, Politics, and the Law, 1933-1937,'' 1974, p. 112-115.</ref> The dispute between the NRA and NLRB threatened to cause the collapse of the NRA Labor Advisory Board, and the automobile, rubber, steel, and textile industries threatened to withdraw from their respective boards.<ref>Gross, ''The Making of the National Labor Relations Board: A Study in Economics, Politics, and the Law, 1933-1937,'' 1974, p. 116-117.</ref> After the NLRB decided in favor of the ''Call-Bulletin's'' workers in December 1934, the NRA refused to enforce the decision.<ref>Gross, ''The Making of the National Labor Relations Board: A Study in Economics, Politics, and the Law, 1933-1937,'' 1974, p. 118-119.</ref> Unfortunately, President Roosevelt issued a letter on January 22, 1935, requesting that the NLRB decline jurisdiction in a small number of NIRA codes and asking the NLRB to submit any recommendations it did make in such disputes confidentially to the president.<ref>Gross, ''The Making of the National Labor Relations Board: A Study in Economics, Politics, and the Law, 1933-1937,'' 1974, p. 119-120.</ref> The following day, Millis, Biddle, and Smith agreed to challenge the president on the jurisdictional issue.<ref>Gross, ''The Making of the National Labor Relations Board: A Study in Economics, Politics, and the Law, 1933-1937,'' 1974, p. 120.</ref> Millis and Smith even threatened to resign, causing the collapse of the NLRB, if Roosevelt insisted on enforcing his letter of January 22.<ref name="GrossMaking121">Gross, ''The Making of the National Labor Relations Board: A Study in Economics, Politics, and the Law, 1933-1937,'' 1974, p. 121.</ref> Millis, Biddle, and Smith met with the President a few days later. Roosevelt agreed not to enforce his letter, to authorize an NLRB investigation into the Newspaper Industry Board's operations, and to write a letter to the NLRB members and staff promising not to get involved in any more jurisdictional issues.<ref name="GrossMaking121" /> However, Roosevelt also made it clear that he wanted the NLRB to steer clear of any disputes in the politically sensitive auto industry.<ref name="GrossMaking121" /> However, although the letter was issued, Roosevelt insisted that it not be made public (so that it would not appear as if he had backed off his previous announcement).<ref>Gross, ''The Making of the National Labor Relations Board: A Study in Economics, Politics, and the Law, 1933-1937,'' 1974, p. 122.</ref>

Millis was not on the "first NLRB" for long. [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Robert F. Wagner]] was continuing to push for comprehensive federal labor relations legislation. His bill, which became the [[National Labor Relations Act]] (NLRA), was enacted by Congress on June 27, 1935, and signed into law by President Roosevelt on July 5.<ref>"Both Houses Clear Wagner Labor Bill," ''New York Times,'' June 28, 1935; "Roosevelt Signs the Wagner Bill As 'Just to Labor'," ''New York Times,'' July 6, 1935.</ref> Millis, wishing to return to his home in Chicago, resigned from the NLRB shortly after passage of the NLRA and was succeeded on the Board by John M. Carmody.<ref>Schlesinger, ''The Age of Roosevelt, Vol. 2: The Coming of the New Deal,'' 2003, p. 406.</ref> Even as he left the Board, however, Millis successfully recommended [[David J. Saposs]] as first Chief Economist to lead the new NLRB Division of Economic Research.<ref>Gross, ''The Making of the National Labor Relations Board: A Study in Economics, Politics, and the Law, 1933-1937,'' 1974, p. 174.</ref>

===Service between NLRBs===
Millis returned to the University of Chicago. One of his students at this time was African American economist [[Oliver Cox]].<ref>Hunter, "Political Economy: Oliver C. Cox," in ''A Different Vision: African American Economic Thought,'' 1996, p. 288.</ref> In 1937, he was appointed a member of the Illinois Commission on Unemployment<ref name="Brown744" /> and President Roosevelt appointed him to a [[Railway Labor Act]] fact-finding board in a dispute between the [[Chicago Great Western Railway]] and [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen|Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers]]<ref>"President Appoints Rail Dispute Board," ''Associated Press,'' February 9, 1937.</ref> His panel found that the railroad should not impose a 15 percent wage reduction on the workers.<ref name="Edwards" /> Roosevelt appointed to a second railways panel in 1938 to arbitrate a dispute between the million members of the [[Railway Labor Executives Association]] (an umbrella group representing 18 railway labor organizations) and the [[Association of American Railways]] (which represented all long-haul railroads in the U.S.).<ref>"Fact Board Set Up On Railway Strike," ''New York Times,'' September 28, 1938; "Rail Board Hears Rival Wage Pleas," ''New York Times,'' October 1, 1938; "Roosevelt Extends Time for Rail Report," ''New York Times,'' October 27, 1938.</ref> In 1940, he sat on a third arbitration panel which decided a long-running wage dispute between [[Railway Express Agency|American Railway Express]] and its unions.<ref name="Edwards" />

In 1940, President Roosevelt asked Millis to become the permanent arbiter beween [[General Motors]] (GM) and the [[United Auto Workers]] (UAW).<ref name="RooseveltSetsUp" /> The 1937 collective bargaining agreement between the company and its union established a temporary, voluntary arbitration procedure, which was made permanent in the 1940 contract.<ref>Lichtenstein, ''Walter Reuther: The Most Dangerous Man in Detroit,'' 1997, p. 144; Brown, "Arbitration," in ''Encyclopedia of U.S. Labor and Working-Class History,'' 2007, p. 123; Stanger, "The Evolution of an Alternative Grievance Procedure: The Columbus Typographical Union No. 5, 1859-1959," in ''New Research on Labor Relations and the Performance of University HR/IR Programs,'' 2001, p. 81.</ref> It was the first permanent arbitration mechanism in any mass production industry,<ref name="Brown744" /> and not only the union but many others were keen to see it succeed.  Several of President Roosevelt's aides and confidantes urged Millis to accept the position.<ref name="Brown744" /> He agreed.<ref name="Edwards" /><ref name="MillisSlated">"Dr. Millis Slated to Head the NLRB," ''New York Times,'' November 7, 1940.</ref> However, Millis refused the large salary that was offered to him, and instead took only the same moderate salary he had been receiving at the university.<ref>Brown, et al., "Harry Alvin Millis, 1873-1948," ''American Economic Review,'' June 1949, p. 748.</ref> Although he was arbitrator for only a few months he laid the groundwork for smooth labor relations not only at General Motors but set a pattern for arbitration that spread throughout the manufacturing sector of the economy.<ref name="Brown744" />

Finally, in March 1940 he joined Collective Bargaining Advisors, a private group dedicated to promoting peaceful labor relations through "scientific" practices.<ref>"Labor Advisors Pick Educator As Head," ''New York Times,'' March 31, 1940.</ref>

==NLRB chairmanship==
Millis had been GM-UAW arbitrator for only a few months when he was asked to be the chairman of the National Labor Relations Board.

===Appointment===
For more than two years, the NLRB had been under severe political pressure, and its chairman, [[J. Warren Madden]], was seen as a political liability. The Board had issued three decisions (''Fansteel Metallurgical'', 5 NLRB 930 (1938);<ref>Fansteel Metallurgical Corporation infiltrated a [[Labor spies|labor spy]] into its employees' union, refused to bargain with the union, and established a [[company union]] to undermine the independent union. On February 17, 1937, the union engaged in a [[sit-down strike]] and seized a portion of the plant. An attempt by sheriff's deputies to eject the men on February 19 failed, but a second attempt on February 26 was successful. On March 14, 1938, the NLRB ruled that Fansteel had to reinstate 90 of the workers.</ref> ''Inland Steel'', 9 NLRB No. 73 (1938);<ref>Inland Steel refused to bargain with the [[Steel Workers Organizing Committee]] (SWOC) and assisted in the formation of and encouraged its workers to join a company union, the Steel Workers' Independent Union. On November 10, 1938, the NLRB ordered Inland Steel to cease and desist from supporting its company union and to bargain with SWOC.</ref> and ''Republic Steel'', 9 NLRB No. 33 (1938)<ref>On May 26, 1937, the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC) conducted a [[recognition strike]] against Republic Steel. The strike soon spread to Bethlehem Steel, Inland Steel, Jones and Laughlin Steel Company, and Youngstown Sheet and Tube<U+2014>the so-called "Little Steel" group (because each company was smaller than the giant U.S. Steel). The [[Little Steel strike]] became one of the most famous in American history. Violence quickly engulfed many of the strikes, with both side employing violence. On May 30, 1937, members of the Chicago Police Department shot and killed 10 unarmed union demonstrators near the Republic Steel plant in Chicago in what later became known as the [[Memorial Day massacre of 1937|Memorial Day massacre]]. On June 18, 1937, SWOC filed [[unfair labor practice]] charges against Republic Steel for its actions in the Little Steel strike. On April 8, 1938, the NLRB ruled against Republic Steel, ordering the company to reinstate all but 11 strikers on the grounds that the company's "brutal acts of violence" had prompted the union violence. It also ordered Republic Steel to lay off all the replacement workers it had hired.</ref>) in 1938 which drew widespread condemnation from businesses and certain members of Congress.<ref>Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 24-30.</ref> The Board won (''[[In re Labor Board]]'', 304 U.S. 486 (1938)) and then lost (''[[Ford Motor Co. v.

===Changes instituted at the Board===
Millis implemented significant administrative changes at the NLRB. His goal was to get the NLRB out of the limelight in wake of Smith Committee investigation.<ref name="GrossReshaping247">Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 247.</ref> He deliberately made the NLRB more dependent on Congress and the executive branch for its survival.<ref>Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 261.</ref>

Millis allied with Leiserson against Edwin S. Smith, and made extensive changes in NLRB administration, doctrine, personnel and operations.<ref>Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 228.</ref> Smith strongly criticized these changes, but Millis replied that Smith had refused to discuss these changes or participate in Board decisions making them and had thus lost his right to criticize.<ref>Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 231-232.</ref> Millis stripped the office of Secretary of all its power and never filled the position, set up an Administrative Division to supervise the 22 regional offices, initiated a study of the Board's administrative procedures, and genuinely delegeated power to the regional offices.<ref>Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 229.</ref> He appointed Robert Watts as the agency's new chief counsel, removed casehandling and regional office communication from the jurisdiction of the Office of the Secretary, created a Field Division, delegated large amounts of authority to field offices, and generally implemented the recommendations of a 1939 internal staff report (which had been stalled by Chairman Madden because it would have taken authority out of Witt's hands).<ref name="Tomlins225">Tomlins, ''The State and the Unions: Labor Relations, Law, and the Organized Labor Movement in America, 1880-1960,'' 1985, p. 225.</ref><ref>Stark, "Methods of NLRB Indicated in Study Made By Own Men," ''New York Times,'' March 22, 1940.</ref> He also adopted most of the recommendations William Leiserson had made regarding how the Board made its decisions, which included basing decisions on trial examiner's report, authorizing NLRB review attorneys to review each report, drafting decisions for review ahead of time, authorizing review attorneys to revise the draft befor a final decision was issued, altering the trial examiner's report to emphsize findings of fact and to support points of law, and holding Board conferences when there were differences of opinion over decisions.<ref name="Tomlins225" /> He also eliminated Review Division's decisive role in cases, which had been established under Madden and Witt.<ref name="Tomlins226">Tomlins, ''The State and the Unions: Labor Relations, Law, and the Organized Labor Movement in America, 1880-1960,'' 1985, p. 226.</ref> Madden and Witt had adopted a highly centralized Board structure so that (generally speaking) only the cases most favorable to the Board made it to the courts. The centralized structure meant that only the strongest cases made it to the Board itself, where the Board could apply all its economic and legal powers to crafting the best desicion possible.  This strategy had enabled to Board to defend itself very well before the Supreme Court, so that the Court upheld the NLRA when few expected it to do so.  But Madden and Witt had held on to the centralized strategy too long, and made political enemies in the process. Millis dismantled Madden's centralized process which had been used to win court litigation, and substituted a decentralized process in which the Board was less a decision-maker and more a provider of services to the regions.<ref name="Tomlins226" /> Many of the changes Millis instituted were designed to mimic requirements placed on other agencies by the [[Administrative Procedure Act]].<ref>Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 264.</ref>

Millis' alliance with Leiserson also overturned a number of the NLRB's more radical precedents and established a more moderate labor policy. Where the Madden Board had issued wide-ranging decisions approving multi-plant locals in ''Shipowners Association of the Pacific Coast'', 7 NLRB 1002 (1938) and ''Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Company'', 10 NLRB 1470 (1939) (decisions that favored [[industrial unionism|industrial unions]] like the CIO), Millis worked with Leiserson to overturn these precedents in ''Shipowners Association of the Pacific Coast'', 32 NLRB 668 (1941) and ''Libbey-Owens Ford'', 31 NLRB 243 (1942).<ref>Tomlins, ''The State and the Unions: Labor Relations, Law, and the Organized Labor Movement in America, 1880-1960,'' 1985, p. 227-229; Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 232-236.</ref> The Millis-led Board also issued a number of decision that turned the bar on representation petitions during the term of the contract into a tool for ensuring the security of incumbent unions.<ref>Tomlins, ''The State and the Unions: Labor Relations, Law, and the Organized Labor Movement in America, 1880-1960,'' 1985, p. 233.</ref> Although the Madden Board had held in ''A. Sartorious'', 10 NLRB 403 (1938), that [[strikebreaker]]s were not eligible to participate in union organizing elections, the Millis Board voted in ''In Rudolph Wurlitzer Co.'', 32, NLRB 163 (1941) to overturn that precedent.<ref name="GrossReshaping236">Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 236.</ref> The Madden Board had held in ''Inland Steel'', 9 NLRB 783 (1938) that a company was responsible for actions of its foremen, but the Millis Board overturned this decision in ''Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc.'', 32 NLRB 1056 (1941).<ref name="GrossReshaping236" /> The Madden Board had ruled several times that an employer could be held guilty of NLRA violations no matter the circumstances, but in in ''New York and Porto Rico S.S. Co.'', 34 NLRB 1028 (1941), the Millis-led Board said the employer was absolved of guilt if it had been forced to act under union economic pressure.<ref>Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 237.</ref> These and other critical decisions by the Millis Board were strongly approved of by Secretary of Labor Perkins and President Roosevelt.<ref>Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 239.</ref>

Not all changes at the NLRB deepened Millis' control of the Board.  When Edwin S. Smith's term expired in August 1941, Millis wrote to Roosevelt and suggested [[William Hammatt Davis]] (Deputy Administrator of the NRA), attorney (and later Senator) [[Wayne Morse]], Professor [[George W. Taylor (professor)|George W. Taylor]], and economist [[Edwin E. Witte]] as Smith's replacement.<ref>Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 239.</ref> Secretary Perkins suggested Gerard D. Reilly, a solicitor in the Department of Labor.<ref>Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 239-240.</ref> Reilly won Roosevelt's approval.  Reilly, however, was very conservative and adopted a [[Legalism (Western philosophy)|legalistic]] approach to labor law, and Millis and many others at the NRLB considered him a [[reactionary]].<ref>Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 241.</ref> Reilly believed Millis was too much influenced by Chief Trial Examiner Frank Bloom (a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] lawyer) and Oscar Smith, head of Field Division.<ref name="Grossreshaping242">Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 242.</ref> Millis thought Reilly's legalism interfered with "realistic" labor relations, and that he was too willing to impose his conservative views on national labor relations policy just as Madden and Smith had imposed their liberal views.<ref name="Grossreshaping242">Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 242.</ref>

===Chairmanship during World War II===
The United States entered World War II on December 8, 1941, and the war significantly changed the NRLB and Millis' tenure as chairman.

On January 12, 1942, President Roosevelt created the [[National War Labor Board]] (NWLB), whose existence displaced the NLRB as the main focus of federal labor relations for the duration of the war.<ref name="GrossReshaping243">Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 243.</ref> The NWLB was given the authority to "finally determine" any labor dispute which threatened to interrupt war production, and to stabilize union wages and benefits during the war.<ref name="GrossReshaping243" /> Although Roosevelt instructed the NWLB not to intrude on jurisdiction exercised by the NLRB, the War Labor Board refused to honor this request.<ref name="GrossReshaping243" /> But Millis was not adept at bureaucratic maneuvering,<ref name="GrossReshaping246">Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 246.</ref> and did not understand that press attention could help him win battles with the NWLB.<ref name="GrossReshaping247" /> For the next three years, Millis tried to secure a jurisdictional agreement with NWLB chair George W. Taylor, but these discussions proved fruitless and Millis broke them off in June 1945.<ref name="GrossReshaping243" /> The NWLB also heavily raided the NLRB for staff, significantly affecting Millis' ability to ensure NLRB operations.  From July 1942 to October 1943, the NLRB lost more than 150 staff, including several regional directors, to the War Labor Board.<ref name="GrossReshaping243" />

Additional changes came with the passage of the [[War Labor Disputes Act]] on June 25, 1943. Enacted over Roosevelt's veto after 400,000 coal miners, their wages significantly lowered due to high wartime inflation, struck for a $2-a-day wage increase,<ref>Malsberger, ''From Obstruction to Moderation: The Transformation of Senate Conservatism'', 1938-1952, 2000, p. 104; Karatnycky, ''Freedom in the World: The Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties, 2000-2001'', 2000, p. 115.</ref> Whenever a union threatened to strike, the legislation required NLRB (in part) to generate a strike ballot outlining all the collective bargaining proposals and counter-proposals, wait 30 days, and then hold a strike vote.<ref>Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 244.</ref> The War Labor Disputes Act proved very burdensome.  The NLRB processed 2,000 WLDA cases from 1943 to the end of 1945, of which 500 were strike votes.<ref name="GrossReshaping245">Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 245.</ref> The act's strike vote procedures did little to stop strikes, however: 203 of the 232 strike votes taken in 1944 led to strike, and Millis feared unions were using the referendums to whip up pro-strike feelings among their members.<ref name="GrossReshaping245" /> Millis also believed the law's strike vote process actually permitted more strikes to occur than the NLRB would have allowed under its old procedures.<ref name="GrossReshaping245" /> There were so many strike vote filings in the six months after the war ended that NLRB actually shut down its long distnace telephone lines, cancelled all out of town travel, suspended all public hearings, and suspended all other business to accommodate the workload.<ref name="GrossReshaping245" />

Additional Board personnel changes further moderated the NLRB during Millis' tenure. [[John Mills Houston]] was appointed to the Board in 1943 after William S. Leiserson's term expired and Lieserson did not seek reappointment to the agency.<ref>Stark, "Houston Named to Labor-Board," ''New York Times,'' March 6, 1943.</ref> Millis formed a voting alliance with Houston some time in late 1944.<ref name="GrossReshaping246" /> Despite this alliance, Millis sometimes was unable to form majorites on the Board.  He vigorously dissented in ''American News Company, Inc.'', 55 1302 (1944), a decision in which the Board held that strikers not protected from discharge or refusals of reinstatement if they struck for an illegal reason.<ref name="GrossReshaping249250">Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 249-250.</ref> Millis feared this would resurrect the vague "legality of objective" test which the Board had rejected long ago.<ref name="GrossReshaping249250" />

By early 1945, Millis was in ill health.<ref name="Obit" />  He resigned from the NLRB on June 7, 1945.<ref>"In Administration Shake-Up," ''Associated Press,'' June 8, 1945.</ref><ref name="WPObit" /> His successor was [[Paul M. Herzog]].

==Retirement and death==
In the fall of 1945, Millis returned to the University of Chicago. He became senior adviser to the newly-formed Industrial Relations Center, and (with former student Emily Clark Brown) began a major analysis of federal labor policy.<ref name="Brown744" /> Their co-authored work, ''From Wagner Act to Taft-Hartley: A Study of National Labor Policy and Labor Relations'', had just been completed when he died.<ref name="Brown744" />

Millis was critical of the Board in his last years. The Madden Board had held in ''American Can Co.'', 13 NLRB 1252 (1939) that a smaller [[craft unionism|craft union]] should not be created if there was any history of industrial union bargaining with the employer.<ref name="GrossReshaping250">Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 250.</ref> Although Millis was critical of the ''American Can'' decision, he nonetheless rarely permitted it to be violated during his tenure on the Board.<ref name="GrossReshaping250" /> He took his successor, Paul Herzog, to task for repeatedly violating the ''American Can'' doctrine between 1945 and 1947.<ref name="GrossReshaping250" /> He also criticized the Herzog Board for becoming too dependent on Congress, for delaying decisions for political reasons, and for allowing consultation with interested parties to appear too much like undue influence<ref>Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 250-251.</ref> He also criticized Herzog for being over-cautious and not enforcing the NLRA strongly enough.<ref>Gross, ''The Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: National Labor Policy in Transition, 1937-1947,'' 1981, p. 251.</ref>

Millis was a member of a number of associations during his lifetime.  He was a longtime member of the [[American Economic Association]], serving as its president from 1934 to 1935.<ref name="PersonalNotes" /><ref name="Brown743" /><ref name="RooseveltSetsUp" /><ref name="GrossMaking7576" /> He was also a member of the Chicago Bibliographic Society,<ref name="PersonalNotes" /> a director of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]],<ref name="Brown743" /> a founder and director of the [[Agricultural Economics Foundation]],<ref name="Brown743" /> and a member of the [[Social Science Research Council]] and the [[Cosmos Club]].<ref name="WPObit" /><ref name="RooseveltSetsUp" />

Harry A. Millis died on June 25, 1948, at Albert Merritt Billings Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, two weeks after suffering a [[stroke]].<ref name="Obit" /><ref name="WPObit" /> He was survived by his wife, Alice; son John (at the time, president of the [[University of Vermont]]); and daughters Savilla and Charlotte.<ref name="WPObit" /><ref>Dr. Harry A.
