'''Fred William Stockham''' (b. [[16 March]] [[1881]], [[Detroit]] &ndash; d. [[22 June]] [[1918]], [[France]]) was a [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine]] who was posthumously awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his self-sacrificial valor during the [[Battle of Belleau Wood]].

Stockham was born in [[Detroit, Michigan]] on [[16 March]] [[1881]]. He enlisted in the Marine Corps on [[16 July]] [[1903]] and, over the next four years, served twice in the [[Philippines]], from [[26 September]] 1903 to [[28 August]] [[1905]] and from [[29 September]] [[1906]] to [[13 January]] [[1907]], and did one tour of duty in [[China]] in the intervening period. Private Stockham was honorably discharged at [[New York City]] on [[15 July]] [[1907]]. Four years later, on [[31 May]] [[1912]], he reenlisted in the Marine Corps. 

By the time he was again discharged, on [[30 May]] [[1916]], he had risen to the rank of sergeant and had served most of his term ashore in [[Nicaragua]]. Sgt. Stockham saw combat during the engagement at [[Le<U+00F3>n, Nicaragua]], on [[6 October]] [[1915]], a little over a month before his departure from that troubled [[Latin America]]n nation. He was honorably discharged again on [[30 May]] [[1916]], this time at [[Mare Island, Calif.]] However, within a week, he had returned to New York City, where on [[7 June]], he reenlisted.

By [[8 February]] [[1918]], Sgt. Stockham was in [[France]] and heading for the trenches. Between that time and his death, he served in the [[Toulon]] sector, in the [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Aisne operation]], and at [[Belleau Wood]]. During the last-named battle, [[Gunnery Sergeant]] Stockham displayed the "conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty" which later earned him the [[Medal of Honor]] by an Act of Congress. On the night of 13&ndash;[[14 June]], 
:"during an intense enemy bombardment with high explosive and gas shells..., Sergeant Stockham upon noticing that the gas mask of a wounded comrade was shot away, without hesitation, removed his own [[gas mask]] and insisted upon giving it to the wounded man, well knowing that the effects of the gas would be fatal to himself. Despite the fact that he was without the protection of a gas mask, he continued with undaunted courage and valor to direct and assist in the evacuation of the wounded in an area saturated with gas and swept by heavy artillery fire, until he himself collapsed from the effects of the gas." 

Gy. Sgt. Stockham died in France on [[22 June]] [[1918]]. Thanks to the efforts of his former comrades, one of whom undoubtedly was the man whose life his gas mask saved, Gy. Sgt. Stockham was belatedly and posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor by an Act of Congress on [[21 December]] [[1939]], over 20 years after his sacrifice.

In [[1943]], the [[destroyer]] [[USS Stockham (DD-683)|USS ''Stockham'']] (DD-683) was named for Gy. Sgt. Fred W. Stockham, USMC.
