==Amateur career==
Shumenov represented Kazakhstan in the [[Boxing at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]]. His results were:

*Defeated [[Aleksy Kuziemski]] (Poland) 34-22
*Lost to [[Ihsan Yildirim Tarhan]] (Turkey) 19-27

He qualified for the Athens Games by winning the gold medal at the [[2004 Asian Amateur Boxing Championships]] in [[Puerto Princesa]], [[Philippines]]. In the final he defeated PR of China's [[Lei Yuping]].

==Professional career==
Shumenov moved to the United States and based himself in Las Vegas where he turned professional in March 2007. In his debut in [[North Carolina]], Shumenov defeated Walter Edwards with a [[knockout]] in the first round.<ref name="Boxrec"/> He followed this up with another two knockout wins within 4 months. 

In March 2008, Shumenov returned to Kazakhstan to fight American Donnell Wiggins for the vacant WBC Asian and interim PABA light heavyweight titles. Shumenov quickly dispatched the experienced Wiggins with a second round knockout and the next month beat former [[US national Golden Gloves champion]] Lavell Finger in the first round to add the vacant WBO Asia Pacific title to his WBC Asian and interim PABA titles.

Shumenov's most high profile fight came in August 2008 when he faced from world champion [[Montell Griffin]] in [[Chimkent]], [[Kazakhstan]] to defend his regional WBC and WBO titles. Shumenov was taken to the scorecards for the first time in his career but won the fight clearly winning every round on all three judges cards.<ref name="Boxrec"/> 

Shumenov was targeting a fight with then [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] World Champion [[Zsolt Erdei]].<ref>http://www.fightnews.com/?p=9596</ref>

==World Title==
[[File:Beibut Shumenov vs. Gabriel Campillo (2).jpg|thumb|left|Shumenov fighting against Gabriel Campillo in 2010 rematch]]
On 15 August 2009 and only 8 professional bouts on his record Shumenov received a shot at the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]]  belt when he took on the Spaniard [[Gabriel Campillo]]. The fight took place in Shumenov's home country of Kazakhstan and resulted in the first loss of his career when Campillo was declared the winner by majority decision. A rematch took place on 9 January 2010, with the result being reversed this time and Shumenov declared the winner by what was considered an extremely controversial split decision.<ref>http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/jan/29/beibut-shumenov-earns-controversial-split-decision/</ref> With this victory Shumenov became the quickest man ever to win a world title in the light heavyweight division, beating the record of 15 fights set by [[Jeff Harding (boxer)|Jeff Harding]] in 1989.<ref>http://www.boxingscene.com/beibut-shumenov-eyes-zsolt-erdei-year-end-clash--39835</ref>

Shumenov made the first defense of his title on 23 July 2010 when he won a unanimous decision against the previously undefeated Viacheslav Uzelkov. Shumenov then arranged to have a unification fight with the then [[WBO]] champion [[J<U+00FC>rgen Br<U+00E4>hmer]], the fight was scheduled to take place in Kazakhstan 8 January 2011. However just days before the fight was due to take place Br<U+00E4>hmer left Kazakhstan and returned to Germany, citing illness as his reason for dropping out of the fight.<ref>http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=5987771</ref> In his place former middleweight world champion [[William Joppy]] stepped in at short notice, and was knocked out by Shumenov in the 6th round.

He successfully defended his title in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] on 29 July, 2011 against former [[The Contender (TV series)|Contender]] star [[Danny Santiago]]<ref>http://www.boxingscene.com/beibut-shumenov-stops-danny-santiago-nine--42108</ref> and again on June 2, 2012 in Las Vegas against [[Enrique Ornelas]].<ref>http://www.boxingscene.com/beibut-shumenov-shuts-out-enrique-ornelas-las-vegas--53567</ref>

Shumenov was promoted to WBA Super champion <ref>http://www.secondsout.com/news/main-news/shumenov-promoted-to-super-champion</ref> and retained the WBA Super and IBA Light Heavyweight titles against Tom<U+00E1><U+0161> Kov<U+00E1>cs, a boxer from the Slovak Republic, on December 14, 2013.<ref>http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/9845995/beibut-shumenov-defend-title-tamas-kovacs</ref>

Shumenov is now expected to face [[Bernard Hopkins]] in a unification bout on April 19, 2014, where Shumenov's WBA (Super) and IBA Light Heavyweight titles will be on the line, as well as Hopkins's IBF Light Heavyweight title.<ref>http://www.badlefthook.com/2014/2/21/5435118/bernard-hopkins-vs-beibut-shumenov-set-for-april-19-in-washington-d-c</ref>

==Plans==
Following on from his earlier efforts to unify the titles, in June 2011 Shumenov expressed an interest in a possible 4 man tournament between himself and the other current beltholders (newly crowned WBO champion [[Nathan Cleverly]], [[IBF]] champion [[Bernard Hopkins]] and the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]]/[[ring magazine|Ring Magazine]] champion [[Chad Dawson]]).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/13626905.stm | work=BBC News | title=Shumenov seeks Cleverly US bout}}</ref>
