'''''Still Reigning''''' is a live performance [[DVD]] by the [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]], released in 2004 through [[American Recordings]]. Filmed at the Augusta Civic Center on July 11, 2004, the performance showcases Slayer's 1986 album, ''[[Reign in Blood]]'', played in its entirety with the four original band members on a set resembling their 1986 "Reign in Pain" tour. ''Still Reigning'' was voted "best live DVD" by the readers of ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' magazine, and received [[Music recording sales certification|gold certification]] in 2005.

The DVD is notable for the finale, which features Slayer covered in stage blood while performing the song "[[Raining Blood]]", leading to a demanding mixing process plagued by production and technical difficulties. The DVD's producer [[Kevin Shirley]], spent hours replacing [[cymbal]] and drum hits one-by-one. He publicly aired financial disagreements he had with the band and criticized the quality of the recording, and as a result was allegedly subjected to threats and insults from people associated with the band.

However, the band's producer [[Rick Rubin]] insisted the band not enter the recording studio due to problems between himself and the band's record label, [[American Recordings]]. The band's manager suggested they record a performance of one of the J<U+00E4>germeister shows and release it on a DVD <U+2014> the band agreed.<ref name="Knac.com interview with Jeff Hanneman">{{cite web| title = Knac.com interview with Jeff Hanneman| author = Davis, Brian  | publisher = Knac.co| url = http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=3153| accessdate = 2006-12-13 }}</ref>

The final track of the DVD, "[[Raining Blood]]", culminates with the band drenched by stage blood. Guitarist [[Jeff Hanneman]] came up with the idea of the blood two years after ''Reign in Blood'''s release, but the band lacked the funding to do so.<ref name="Knac.com interview with Jeff Hanneman"/> The beginning of the film ''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]'' (released in 1998) features a "bloodbath" with [[vampires]] dancing in a club with blood coming from the roof via a sprinkler system. The scene revived Jeff Hanneman and guitarist [[Kerry King]]'s interest, and since the band released a DVD the previous year &mdash; ''[[War at the Warfield]]'' &mdash; they decided to add something different for the new DVD &mdash;  raining blood.<ref name="Knac.com interview with Jeff Hanneman"/> King asserted that since Lombardo was not on the previous DVD, this one was going to be important. Due to the short length of the DVD, director [[Dean Karr]] chose an additional bonus six songs from the same show as he thought certain members excelled in the performances.<ref name="GuitarKing">King, Kerry.

==Recording and production==
''Still Reigning'' was recorded at the Augusta Civic Center in [[Augusta, Maine]] on July 11, 2004, prior to the 2004 [[Ozzfest]]. A ten-man camera crew under the direction of Dean Karr was on hand to document the show, backstage action, and exclusive interviews inside the band's tour bus.<ref name="Producer Says New SLAYER DVD Was 'Tough To Mix' Due To Its Sloppiness"/> The interview, "Slayer: In their own words", is a seventeen-minute piece which features the band talking about their early years, influences, writing lyrics, Lombardo's return, and the band's eventual retirement. At one point Lombardo rejected the possibility of a future "good-bye tour" for Slayer, and states if the band realize they have "lost a step" they will "call it a day".<ref name="Slayer: Still Reigning The landmark metal album performed in its entirety."/>

The stage was converted to resemble the band's 1986 "Reign in Pain" tour, which featured the Slayer eagle and inverted crosses as part of the lighting rig.<ref name="SLAYER To Document 'Reign in Blood' Performance On Upcoming DVD">{{cite web

[[Kevin Shirley]], who has worked with the bands [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Dream Theater]], produced the DVD. He issued a statement describing the demanding mixing process which took place at his New York Studio: "It's OK <U+2014> some places it rocks hard, and others are a bit sloppy, but I'm sure they won't use the whole concert.

On September 30, 2006, Shirley issued a further statement claiming he had not been paid for his work, and had received threats and insults from people associated with the band: "I've just mixed a really wonderful band with one of the worst sounding recordings ever. It's kinda disgraceful that they won't spend anything on a decent recording! I won't say who, because last time I commented on a sloppy recording (on this page), they refused to pay me and I got all manner of threats and insults from people associated with the band, so I'd best be quiet!"<ref name="Producer KEVIN SHIRLEY Comments On SLAYER's 'Reign in Blood Live: Still Reigning' DVD"/>

The stage blood caused technical difficulties as it soaked the microphone, guitars, and cymbals, which according to Shirley sounded like "coffee mugs being tapped with a spoon".<ref name="Producer KEVIN SHIRLEY Comments On SLAYER's 'Reign in Blood Live: Still Reigning' DVD"/> A review of the DVD observed that "If it wasn't for guitarist Jeff Hanneman being out of position and missing all of the blood, the guitar might have sounded pretty bad."<ref name="Slayer: Still Reigning The landmark metal album performed in its entirety."/> Hanneman missed the initial downpour due to a technical problem with his guitar, and was deluged by a light shower when coming back on-stage.<ref name="Slayer to headline this fall's Jagermeister Music Tour; Slayer DVD 'Still Reigning' to be released October 26, 2004">{{cite web

Slayer received a positive reception when performing at the Augusta Civic Center. On finishing half the [[set list]], the band briefly left the stage and returned to play the 28 minute album, ''Reign in Blood'' as an encore. On the final song, "Raining Blood" the lights were turned off and Slayer members were deluged by two buckets of stage blood. According to King, the crowd went quiet for a few seconds until they realized the blood was part of the show. King thought Araya looked like a psychotic mass murderer, which contributed to the crowd's reaction. Following the two large drops,   stage blood mixed with water was used so it looked like it was "raining blood".<ref name="GuitarKing"/>

Andy Patrizio of [[IGN]] awarded the DVD six out of ten commenting, "[[Tom Araya]] lost his piercing shriek that opens '[[Angel of Death (song)|Angel of Death]]' and the end of 'Necrophobic'",<ref name="Slayer: Still Reigning The landmark metal album performed in its entirety."/> praising Lombardo's return by saying the drummer "...hasn't lost a step at all. With barely any breathing time between songs, the underground drum legend shows that an impending 40th birthday (next month) isn't going to slow him down."<ref name="Slayer: Still Reigning The landmark metal album performed in its entirety."/> Patrizio stated the production was not of the highest caliber, as the rapid "[[MTV]]-style" cuts were distracting, as was the switch from black and white to color shots.<ref name="Slayer: Still Reigning The landmark metal album performed in its entirety."/> Patrizio ended the review with the comment, "This is what you get for letting [[Uwe Boll]] direct your music video", Boll being a heavily criticized [[film director]].<ref name="Slayer: Still Reigning The landmark metal album performed in its entirety.">{{cite web
