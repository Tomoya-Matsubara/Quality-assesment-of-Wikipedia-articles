In traditional belief and [[fiction]], a '''ghost''' (sometimes known as a '''spectre''' (British English) or '''specter''' (American English), '''phantom''', '''apparition''' or '''spook''') is the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] or [[spirit]] of a dead person or animal that can appear, in visible form or other manifestation, to the living. Descriptions of the [[Apparitional experience|apparition of ghosts]] vary widely from an invisible presence to translucent or barely visible wispy shapes, to realistic, lifelike visions. The deliberate attempt to contact the spirit of a deceased person is known as [[necromancy]], or in [[spiritism]] as a ''[[s<U+00E9>ance]]''.

The belief in manifestations of the spirits of the dead is widespread, dating back to [[animism]] or [[ancestor worship]] in pre-literate cultures. Certain religious practices<U+2014>funeral rites, [[exorcism]]s, and some practices of [[spiritualism]] and [[ritual magic]]<U+2014>are specifically designed to rest the spirits of the dead. Ghosts are generally described as solitary essences that haunt particular [[List of reportedly haunted locations|locations]], objects, or people they were associated with in life, though stories of phantom armies, [[Ghost train (folklore)|ghost trains]], [[List of ghost ships|phantom ships]], and even ghost [[animal]]s have also been recounted.<ref>Hole, pp. 150<U+2013>163</ref><ref>{{cite book

==Terminology==
{{Further|spirit|soul (spirit)|wikt:anima|genius (mythology)|Geist}}
The English word ''[[:wikt:ghost|ghost]]'' continues [[Old English]] ''[[:wikt:gast#Old English|g<U+00E1>st]]'', from a hypothetical [[Common Germanic]] ''*gaistaz''. It is common to [[West Germanic]], but lacking in North and East Germanic (the equivalent word in [[Gothic language|Gothic]] is ''ahma'', [[Old Norse]] has ''andi'' m., ''<U+00F6>nd'' f.).
The pre-Germanic form was ''{{PIE|*ghoisdo-s}}'', apparently from a root denoting "fury, anger" reflected in Old Norse ''geisa'' "to rage". The Germanic word is recorded as masculine only, but likely continues a neuter ''s''-stem. The original meaning of the Germanic word would thus have been an animating principle of the [[mind]], in particular capable of excitation and fury (compare ''[[<U+00F3><U+00F0>r]]''). In [[Germanic paganism]], "[[Germanic Mercury]]", and the later [[Odin]], was at the same time the [[conductor of the dead]] and the "lord of fury" leading the [[Wild Hunt]].

Besides denoting the human spirit or soul, both of the living and the deceased, the Old English word is used as a synonym of Latin ''[[spirit]]us'' also in the meaning of "breath" or "blast" from the earliest attestations (9th century). It could also denote any good or evil spirit, i.e. angels and demons; the [[Anglo-Saxon]] gospel refers to the [[demonic possession]] of Matthew 12:43 as ''se uncl<U+00E6>na gast''. Also from the Old English period, the word could denote the spirit of God, viz. the "[[Holy Ghost]]".
The now prevailing sense of "the soul of a deceased person, spoken of as appearing in a visible form" only emerges in [[Middle English]] (14th century).
The modern noun does, however, retain a wider field of application, extending on one hand to "soul", "spirit", "[[vital principle]]", "[[mind]]" or "[[psyche (psychology)|psyche]]", the seat of feeling, thought and moral judgement; on the other hand used figuratively of any shadowy outline, fuzzy or unsubstantial image, in optics, photography and cinematography especially a flare, secondary image or spurious signal.<ref>{{cite web|title=ghost|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/78064|work=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=27 August 2013}}</ref>

The synonym ''[[:wikt:spook|spook]]'' is a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] loanword, akin to [[Low German]] ''sp<U+00F4>k'' (of uncertain etymology); it entered the English language via the [[American English|United States]] in the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|title=spook|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/187392|work=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=27 August 2013}}</ref><ref>Mencken, H.

''[[:wikt:wraith|Wraith]]'' is a [[Scots language|Scots]] word for "ghost", "spectre" or "apparition". It came to be used in Scottish Romanticist literature, and acquired the more general or figurative sense of "portent" or "[[omen]]". In 18th- to 19th-century Scottish literature, it was also applied to aquatic spirits. The word has no commonly accepted etymology; the ''[[OED]]'' notes "of obscure origin" only.<ref>{{cite web|title=wraith|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/230504|work=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=27 August 2013}}</ref>  An association with the verb ''[[:wikt:writhe|writhe]]'' was the etymology favored by [[J.

A ''[[Revenant (folklore)|revenant]]'' is a deceased person returning from the dead to haunt the living, either as a disembodied ghost or alternatively as an animated ("[[undead]]") corpse. Also related is the concept of a [[Fetch (folklore)|fetch]], the visible ghost or spirit of a person yet alive.

==Typology==

===Anthropological context===
{{Further|Animism|Ancestor worship|Origin of religion|Anthropology of religion}}

A notion of the [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], [[supernatural]] or [[numinous]], usually involving entities like ghosts, [[demon]]s or [[deity|deities]], is a [[cultural universal]].<ref>[[Donald Brown (anthropologist)|Donald Brown]] (1991) ''Human Universals''. Philadelphia, [[Temple University Press]] ([http://condor.depaul.edu/~mfiddler/hyphen/humunivers.htm online summary]).</ref> In pre-literate [[folk religion]]s, these beliefs are often summarized under [[animism]] and [[ancestor worship]].<ref name="EncyOccult">Some people believe the ghost or [[spirit]] never leaves Earth until there is no-one left to remember the one who died. Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology edited by [[J. Gordon Melton]], [[Gale Group]], ISBN 0-8103-5487-X</ref>

In many cultures malignant, restless ghosts are distinguished from the more benign spirits involved in [[ancestor worship]].<ref>Richard Cavendish (1994) ''The World of Ghosts and the Supernatural''. Waymark Publications, Basingstoke: 5</ref>

Ancestor worship typically involves rites intended to prevent [[Revenant (folklore)|revenants]], [[vengeful spirit]]s of the dead, imagined as starving and envious of the living. Strategies for preventing revenants may either include [[sacrifice]], i.e., giving the dead food and drink to pacify them, or magical banishment of the deceased to force them not to return. Ritual feeding of the dead is performed in traditions like the Chinese [[Ghost Festival]] or the Western [[All Souls' Day]]. Magical banishment of the dead is present in many of the world's [[burial custom]]s. The bodies found in many [[tumuli]] ([[kurgan]]) had been ritually bound before burial,<ref>e.g. in graves of the [[Irish Bronze Age]] [http://www.iol.ie/~sec/sites.htm IOL.ie]</ref> and the custom of binding the dead persists, for example, in rural [[Anatolia]].<ref>"In the immediate aftermath of a death, the deceased is removed from the bed he died in and placed on the prepared floor, called a <U+2018>comfort bed.<U+2019> His jaw is bound up and his feet tied together (usually at the big toes)." [http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D313A781CAA92714FCE0C49C9FC1BDC7E02B Kultur.gov.tr]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref>

Nineteenth-century [[anthropologist]] [[James Frazer]] stated in his classic work, ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', that souls were seen as the creature within that animated the body.<ref name="GoldenBough">"If a man lives and moves, it can only be because he has a little man or animal inside, who moves him. The animal inside the animal, the man inside the man, is the soul. And as the activity of an animal or man is explained by the presence of the soul, so the repose of sleep or death is explained by its absence; sleep or trance being the temporary, death being the permanent absence of the soul...

===Ghosts and the afterlife===
{{Further|Soul (spirit)|Psyche (psychology)|Underworld|Hungry ghost|Psychopomp}}
{{Further|Ghost Festival|All Souls' Day|Day of the Dead|Ghost Dance}}
Although the human soul was sometimes symbolically or literally depicted in ancient cultures as a bird or other animal, it appears to have been widely held that the soul was an exact reproduction of the body in every feature, even down to clothing the person wore. This is depicted in artwork from various ancient cultures, including such works as the ''[[Egyptian Book of the Dead]]'', which shows deceased people in the afterlife appearing much as they did before death, including the style of dress.

===Fear of ghosts===
{{main|Fear of ghosts}}
[[File:Suushi Yurei.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Y<U+016B>rei]] (Japanese ghost) from the [[Hyakkai Zukan]], ca. 1737]]
While deceased ancestors are [[cultural universal|universally]] regarded as venerable, and often imagined as having a continued presence in some sort of [[afterlife]], the spirit of a deceased person which remains present in the material world (viz. a ghost) is regarded as an unnatural or undesirable state of affairs and 
the idea of ghosts or [[Revenant (folklore)|revenants]] is associated with a reaction of [[fear]]. This is universally the case in pre-modern folk cultures, but fear of ghosts also remains an integral aspect of the modern [[ghost story]], [[Gothic horror]], and other [[horror fiction]] dealing with the supernatural.

===Common attributes===
Another widespread belief concerning ghosts is that they are composed of a misty, airy, or subtle material. [[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] link this idea to early beliefs that ghosts were the person within the person (the person's spirit), most noticeable in ancient cultures as a person's breath, which upon exhaling in colder climates appears visibly as a white mist.<ref name="EncyOccult">''Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology'' edited by J. Gordon Melton, Gale Group, ISBN 0-8103-5487-X</ref> This belief may have also fostered the metaphorical meaning of "breath" in certain languages, such as the [[Latin]] ''spiritus'' and the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[pneuma]]'', which by [[analogy]] became extended to mean the soul. In the [[Bible]], [[God]] is depicted as synthesising [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], as a living soul, from the dust of the Earth and the breath of God.

In many traditional accounts, ghosts were often thought to be deceased people looking for vengeance ([[vengeful ghost]]s), or imprisoned on earth for bad things they did during life. The appearance of a ghost has often been regarded as an omen or portent of death. Seeing one's own ghostly double or "[[Doppelg<U+00E4>nger|fetch]]" is a related omen of death.<ref>Hole, pp. 13<U+2013>27</ref>

[[White Lady (ghost)|White ladies]] were reported to appear in many rural areas, and supposed to have died tragically or suffered trauma in life. White Lady legends are found around the world. Common to many of them is the theme of losing or being betrayed by a husband or fianc<U+00E9>. They are often associated with an individual family line or regarded as a harbinger of death similar to a [[banshee]].

Legends of ghost ships have existed since the 18th century; most notable of these is the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]''. This theme has been used in literature in ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' by Coleridge.

===Locale===
{{See also|Haunted house}}

A place where ghosts are reported is described as [[List of reportedly haunted locations|haunted]], and often seen as being inhabited by [[Soul (spirit)|spirits]] of deceased who may have been former residents or were familiar with the property. Supernatural activity inside homes is said to be mainly associated with violent or tragic events in the building's past such as murder, accidental death, or suicide <U+2014> sometimes in the recent or ancient past. But not all hauntings are at a place of a violent death, or even on violent grounds. Many cultures and [[religion]]s believe the essence of a being, such as the '[[Soul (spirit)|soul]]', continues to exist. Some religious views argue that the 'spirits' of those who have died have not 'passed over' and are trapped inside the property where their memories and energy are strong.

There are many references to [[ghosts in Mesopotamian religions]] <U+2013> the religions of [[Sumer]], [[Babylon]], [[Assyria]] and other early states in [[Mesopotamia]]. Traces of these beliefs survive in the later [[Abrahamic religion]]s that came to dominate the region.<ref>{{cite book

Ghosts were thought to be created at time of death, taking on the memory and personality of the dead person. They traveled to the netherworld, where they were assigned a position, and led an existence similar in some ways to that of the living.
Relatives of the dead were expected to make offerings of food and drink to the dead to ease their conditions. If they did not, the ghosts could inflict misfortune and illness on the living. Traditional healing practices ascribed a variety of illnesses to the action of ghosts, while others were caused by gods or demons.<ref name=black>{{cite book

The [[Hebrew Bible]] contains few references to ghosts, associating spiritism with forbidden occult activities cf. [[Deuteronomy]] 18:11. The most notable reference is in the First [[Books of Samuel|Book of Samuel]] (I Samuel 28:3<U+2013>19 KJV), in which a disguised [[Saul the King|King Saul]] has the [[Witch of Endor]] summon the spirit/ghost of [[Samuel (biblical figure)|Samuel]].

There was widespread belief in [[ghosts in ancient Egyptian culture]] in the sense of the continued existence of the [[Egyptian soul|soul]] and spirit after death, with the ability to assist or harm the living, and the possibility of a second death. Over a period of more than 2,500 years, Egyptian beliefs about the nature of the afterlife evolved constantly. Many of these beliefs were recorded in inscriptions, papyrus scrolls and tomb paintings.

===Classical Antiquity===
{{further|Shade (mythology)|Magic in the Greco-Roman world}}

====Archaic and Classical Greece====
Ghosts appeared in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Iliad]]'', in which they were described as vanishing "as a vapor, gibbering and whining into the earth". Homer<U+2019>s ghosts had little interaction with the world of the living. Periodically they were called upon to provide advice or prophecy, but they do not appear to be particularly feared. Ghosts in the classical world often appeared in the form of vapor or smoke, but at other times they were described as being substantial, appearing as they had been at the time of death, complete with the wounds that killed them.<ref>Finucane, pp. 4, 16</ref>

By the 5th century BC, [[Classical Greece|classical Greek]] ghosts had become haunting, frightening creatures who could work to either good or evil purposes. The spirit of the dead was believed to hover near the resting place of the corpse, and cemeteries were places the living avoided. The dead were to be ritually mourned through public ceremony, sacrifice and libations, or they might return to haunt their families. The ancient Greeks held annual feasts to honor and placate the spirits of the dead, to which the family ghosts were invited, and after which they were <U+201C>firmly invited to leave until the same time next year<U+201D>.<ref>Finucane, pp. 8<U+2013>11</ref>

The 5th century BC play ''[[Oresteia]]'' contains one of the first ghosts to appear in a work of fiction.

====Roman Empire and Late Antiquity====
The [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] believed a ghost could be used to exact revenge on an enemy by scratching a curse on a piece of lead or pottery and placing it into a grave.<ref>Finucane, pg 12</ref>

[[Plutarch]], in the 1st century AD, described the haunting of the baths at [[Chaeronea]] by the ghost of a murdered man. The ghost<U+2019>s loud and frightful groans caused the people of the town to seal up the doors of the building.<ref>Finucane, pg 13</ref> Another celebrated account of a haunted house from the ancient classical world is given by [[Pliny the Younger]] ([[circa|c.]] 50 AD).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siu.edu/news/ghosts.html |title=Classical ghost stories |accessdate=2007-09-19 |last=Jaehnig |first=K.C. |date=1999-03-11 |publisher= Southern Illinois University |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070908171955/http://www.siu.edu/news/ghosts.html |archivedate = September 8, 2007}}</ref> Pliny describes the haunting of a house in [[Athens]] by a ghost bound in chains. The hauntings ceased when the ghost's shackled skeleton was unearthed, and given a proper reburial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/9/4/1083.html |title=LXXXIII. To Sura |accessdate=2007-09-19 |first=Pliny the Younger |work=bartleby.com }}</ref> The writers [[Plautus]] and [[Lucian]] also wrote stories about haunted houses.

In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] has to persuade the [[Twelve Apostles|Disciples]] that he is not a ghost following the [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 24:37<U+2013>39 (some versions of the Bible, such as the KJV and NKJV, use the term "spirit"). In a similar vein, Jesus' followers at first believe him to be a ghost (spirit) when they see him [[walking on water]].

One of the first persons to express disbelief in ghosts was [[Lucian of Samosata]] in the 2nd century AD. In his tale "The Doubter" (circa 150 AD) he relates how [[Democritus]] "the learned man from [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] in [[Thrace]]" lived in a tomb outside the [[city gate]]s to prove that cemeteries were not haunted by the spirits of the departed. Lucian relates how he persisted in his disbelief despite [[practical joke]]s perpetrated by "some young men of Abdera" who dressed up in black robes with skull masks to frighten him.<ref>"The Doubter" by Lucian in Roger Lancelyn Green (1970) ''Thirteen Uncanny Tales''. London, Dent: 14<U+2013>21; and Finucane, pg 26</ref> This account by Lucian notes something about the popular classical expectation of how a ghost should look.

In the 5th century AD, the Christian priest [[Constantius of Lyon]] recorded an instance of the recurring theme of the improperly buried dead who come back to haunt the living, and who can only cease their haunting when their bones have been discovered and properly reburied.<ref>F. R. Hoare, ''The Western Fathers'', Sheed & Ward: New York, 1954, pp. 294<U+2013>5.</ref>

===Middle Ages===
Ghosts reported in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] tended to fall into two categories: the souls of the dead, or demons. The souls of the dead returned for a specific purpose. Demonic ghosts were those which existed only to torment or tempt the living. The living could tell them apart by demanding their purpose in the name of Jesus Christ. The soul of a dead person would divulge their mission, while a demonic ghost would be banished at the sound of the Holy Name.<ref>Finucane, Ch. 3</ref>

Most ghosts were souls assigned to [[Purgatory]], condemned for a specific period to atone for their transgressions in life. Their penance was generally related to their sin. For example, the ghost of a man who had been abusive to his servants was condemned to tear off and swallow bits of his own tongue; the ghost of another man, who had neglected to leave
his cloak to the poor, was condemned to wear the cloak, now "heavy as a church tower". These ghosts appeared to the living to ask for prayers to end their suffering. Other dead souls returned to urge the living to confess their sins before their own deaths.<ref>Fincucane, pp. 70<U+2013>77.</ref>

Medieval European ghosts were more substantial than ghosts described in the [[Victorian era|Victorian age]], and there are accounts of ghosts being wrestled with and physically restrained until a priest could arrive to hear its confession. Some were less solid, and could move through walls. Often they were described as paler and sadder versions of the person they had been while alive, and dressed in tattered gray rags. The vast majority of reported sightings were male.<ref>Finucane, pp. 83<U+2013>84.</ref>

There were some reported cases of ghostly armies, fighting battles at night in the forest, or in the remains of an [[Iron Age]] hillfort, as at [[Wandlebury]], near Cambridge, England. Living knights were sometimes challenged to single combat by phantom knights, which vanished when defeated.<ref name="Finucanepg">Finucane, pg. 79.</ref>

From the medieval period an apparition of a ghost is recorded from 1211, at the time of the [[Albigensian Crusade]].<ref>[[Mark Gregory Pegg]] (2008) ''A Most Holy War''. [[Oxford University Press]], New York: 3<U+2013>5, 116<U+2013>117. ISBN 978-0-19-517131-0</ref> [[Gervase of Tilbury]], Marshal of [[Arles]], wrote that the image of Guilhem, a boy recently murdered in the forest, appeared in his cousin's home in [[Beaucaire, Gard|Beaucaire]], near [[Avignon]]. This series of "visits" lasted all of the summer. Through his cousin, who spoke for him, the boy allegedly held conversations with anyone who wished, until the local priest requested to speak to the boy directly, leading to an extended disquisition on theology.

The time of the Albigensian Crusade in southern France was marked by intense and prolonged warfare, this constant bloodshed and dislocation of populations being the context for these reported visits by the murdered boy.

Depicting ghosts as wearing armor, to suggest a sense of antiquity, was common in [[Elizabethan theater]].]]

[[Renaissance magic]] took a revived interest in the [[occult]], including [[necromancy]]. In the era of the Reformation and Counter Reformation, there was frequently a backlash against unwholesome interest in the dark arts, typified by writers such as [[Thomas Erastus]].<ref>Walker, D.P.

The [[Child ballad]] "[[Sweet William's Ghost]]" (1868) recounts the story of a ghost returning to his fianc<U+00E9>e begging her to free him from his promise to marry her. He cannot marry her because he is dead but her refusal would mean his damnation. This reflects a popular British belief that the dead haunted their lovers if they took up with a new love without some formal release.<ref>[[Francis James Child|Child, Francis James]], ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v. 2, p. 227, Dover Publications, New York 1965</ref> "[[The Unquiet Grave]]" expresses a belief even more widespread, found in various locations over Europe: ghosts can stem from the excessive grief of the living, whose mourning interferes with the dead's peaceful rest.<ref>Child, Francis James, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 2, p 234, Dover Publications, New York 1965</ref> In many folktales from around the world, the hero arranges for the burial of a dead man.

The religion flourished for a half century without canonical texts or formal organization, attaining cohesion by periodicals, tours by trance lecturers, camp meetings, and the missionary activities of accomplished mediums. Many prominent Spiritualists were women. Most followers supported causes such as the [[abolition of slavery]] and [[women's suffrage]].<ref name="Braude" /> By the late 1880s, credibility of the informal movement weakened, due to accusations of fraud among mediums, and formal Spiritualist organizations began to appear.<ref name="Braude" /> Spiritualism is currently practiced primarily through various denominational [[Spiritualist Church]]es in the United States and United Kingdom.

Spiritism, or French spiritualism, is based on the five books of the [[Spiritist Codification]] written by [[French people|French]] educator Hypolite L<U+00E9>on Denizard Rivail under the [[pseudonym]] [[Allan Kardec]] reporting [[s<U+00E9>ance]]s in which he observed a series of phenomena that he attributed to incorporeal intelligence ([[spirit]]s). His assumption of spirit communication was validated by many contemporaries, among them many scientists and philosophers who attended s<U+00E9>ances and studied the phenomena. His work was later extended by writers like [[Leon Denis]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Camille Flammarion]], Ernesto Bozzano, [[Chico Xavier]], Divaldo Pereira Franco, [[Waldo Vieira]], [[Johannes Greber]]<ref>[http://www.seanet.com/~raines/greber.html Johannes Greber].

The physician [[John Ferriar]] wrote ''An essay towards a theory of apparitions'' in 1813 in which he argued that sightings of ghosts were the result of [[optical illusions]]. Later the French physician [[Alexandre Jacques Fran<U+00E7>ois Bri<U+00E8>re de Boismont]] published ''On Hallucinations: Or, the Rational History of Apparitions, Dreams, Ecstasy, Magnetism, and Somnambulism'' in 1845 in which he claimed sightings of ghosts were the result of [[hallucinations]].<ref>McCorristine, Shane  ''Spectres of the Self: Thinking About Ghosts and Ghost-Seeing in England, 1750<U+2013>1920'' 2010, ISBN 1139788825 pp. 44<U+2013>56</ref><ref>Gelder, Ken ''The horror reader'' 2000, ISBN 0415213568 pp. 43<U+2013>44</ref>

According to research in [[anomalistic psychology]] visions of ghosts may arise from [[Hypnagogia|hypnagogic]] hallucinations ("waking dreams" which are experienced in the transitional states to and from [[sleep]]).<ref>{{cite journal|author=Klemperer, Frances|year=1992|title=Ghosts, Visions, And Voices: Sometimes Simply Perceptual Mistakes|journal= British Medical Journal |volume= 305|issue=6868 |pages=1518<U+2013>1519|jstor=29717993|doi=10.1136/bmj.305.6868.1518|pmid=1286367|pmc=1884722}}</ref> In a study of two experiments into alleged [[hauntings]] (Wiseman ''et al''. 2003) came to the conclusion "that people consistently report unusual experiences in <U+2018>haunted<U+2019> areas because of environmental factors, which may differ across locations."

Some researchers, such as [[Michael Persinger]] of [[Laurentian University]], Canada, have speculated that changes in [[geomagnetic]] fields (created, e.g., by tectonic stresses in the Earth's crust or [[Solar variation|solar activity]]) could stimulate the brain's [[temporal lobe]]s and produce many of the experiences associated with hauntings.<ref>[http://www.richardwiseman.com/research/ghosts.html Richard Wiseman].

===European folklore===
{{Further|Revenant (folklore)|Necromancy|Samhain}}

Belief in ghosts in [[European folklore]] is characterized by the recurring fear of "returning" or ''[[Revenant (folklore)|revenant]]'' deceased who may harm the living. This includes the Scandinavian ''[[gjenganger]]'', the Romanian ''[[strigoi]]'', the Serbian ''[[vampire|vampir]]'', the Greek ''[[vrykolakas]]'', etc. In Scandinavian and Finnish tradition, ghosts appear in corporeal form and their supernatural nature is given away by behavior rather than appearance. In fact, in many stories they are first mistaken for the living. They may be mute, appear and disappear suddenly, or leave no footprints or other traces.

[[English folklore|British folklore]] is particularly notable for its numerous [[List of reportedly haunted locations#United Kingdom|haunted locations]].

Belief in the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and an [[afterlife]] remained near universal until the emergence of [[atheism]] in the 18th century. In the 19th century, [[spiritism]] resurrected "belief in ghosts" as the object of systematic inquiry, and popular opinion in [[Western culture]] remains divided.<ref>Paul Chambers (2006) ''The Cock Lane Ghost''.

Interpretations of how ''bhoot''s come into existence vary by region and community, but they are usually considered to be perturbed and restless due to some factor that prevents them from moving on (to [[reincarnation|transmigration]], non-being, [[nirvana]], or heaven or hell, depending on tradition).

It is also believed that if someone calls you from behind never turn back and see because the spirit may catch the human to make it a spirit.
Other types of spirits in Hindu Mythology include [[Baital]], an evil spirit who haunts cemeteries and takes demonic possession of corpses, and [[Pishacha]], a type of flesh-eating demon.

There are many [[Malay ghost myths]], remnants of old animist beliefs that have been shaped by later Hindu, Buddhist and Muslim influences in the modern states of [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]]. Some ghost concepts such as the female vampires [[Pontianak (folklore)|Pontianak]] and [[Penanggalan]] are shared throughout the region.
Ghosts are a popular theme in modern Malaysian and Indonesian films.
There are also many references to [[Ghosts in Filipino culture]], ranging from ancient legendary creatures such as the [[Manananggal]] and [[Tiyanak]] to more modern urban legends and horror films.
The beliefs, legends and stories are as diverse as the people of the [[Philippines]].

There was widespread belief in [[ghosts in Polynesian culture]], some of which persists today.
After death, a person's ghost normally traveled to the sky world or the underworld, but some could stay on earth. In many [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]] legends, ghosts were often actively involved in the affairs of the living. Ghosts might also cause sickness or even invade the body of ordinary people, to be driven out through strong medicines.<ref>{{cite book

There are many references to ghosts in Chinese culture. Even Confucius said, "Respect ghosts and gods, but keep away from them."<ref name=mincul>{{cite web

The ghosts take many forms, depending on how the person died, and are often harmful. Many Chinese ghost beliefs have been accepted by neighboring cultures, notably Japan and south-east Asia. Ghost beliefs are closely associated with traditional Chinese religion based on ancestor worship, many of which were incorporated in [[Taoism]]. Later beliefs were influenced by [[Buddhism]], and in turn influenced and created uniquely Chinese Buddhist beliefs.

Many Chinese today believe it possible to contact the spirits of their ancestors through a medium, and that ancestors can help descendants if properly respected and rewarded. The annual [[ghost festival]] is celebrated by Chinese around the world. On this day, ghosts and [[spiritual being|spirits]], including those of the deceased ancestors, come out from the [[Underworld|lower realm]].
Ghosts are described in classical Chinese texts as well as modern literature and films.

A recent article in the China Post stated that nearly eighty seven percent of Chinese office workers believe in ghosts, and some fifty two percent of workers will wear hand art, necklaces, crosses, or even place a crystal ball on their desks to keep ghosts at bay, according to the poll.

{{Nihongo|'''Y<U+016B>rei'''|[[wikt:<U+5E7D><U+970A>|<U+5E7D><U+970A>]]}} are figures in [[Japanese folklore]], analogous to Western legends of ghosts. The name consists of two [[kanji]], [[wikt:<U+5E7D>|<U+5E7D>]] (''y<U+016B>''), meaning "faint" or "dim" and [[wikt:<U+970A>|<U+970A>]] (''rei''), meaning "soul" or "spirit". Alternative names include <U+4EA1><U+970A> (B<U+014D>rei) meaning ruined or departed spirit, <U+6B7B><U+970A> (Shiry<U+014D>) meaning dead spirit, or the more encompassing <U+5996><U+602A> ([[Y<U+014D>kai]]) or <U+304A><U+5316><U+3051> ([[Obake]]).

Ghosts in [[Thailand]] are part of local [[Thai folklore|folklore]] and have now become part of the popular culture of the country.
[[Phraya Anuman Rajadhon]] was the first Thai scholar who seriously studied Thai folk beliefs and took notes on the [[nocturnal]] village spirits of Thailand. He established that, since such spirits were not represented in paintings or drawings, they were purely based on descriptions of popular [[Oral tradition|traditional stories]] which were transmitted orally.

There is widespread belief in ghosts in Tibetan culture. Ghosts are explicitly recognized in the [[Tibetan Buddhist]] religion as they were in [[History of Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Conze |first=Edward |title=A Short History of Buddhism |edition=2|year=1993  |publisher=Oneworld |location=Oxford }}</ref> occupying a distinct but overlapping world to the human one, and feature in many traditional legends. When a human dies, after a period of uncertainty they may enter the ghost world. A [[hungry ghost]] (Tibetan: ''yidag'', ''yi-dvags''; Sanskrit: ''preta'', <U+092A><U+094D><U+0930><U+0947><U+0924>) has a tiny throat and huge stomach, and so can never be satisfied.
Ghosts may be killed with a ritual dagger or caught in a spirit trap and burnt, thus releasing them to be reborn. Ghosts may also be exorcised, and an annual festival is held throughout Tibet for this purpose. Some say that [[Dorje Shugden]], the ghost of a powerful 17th-century monk, is a deity, but the [[Dalai Lama]] asserts that he is an evil spirit, which has caused a split in the Tibetan exile community.

There is extensive and varied belief in [[ghosts in Mexican culture]]. The modern state of [[Mexico]] before the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest]] was inhabited by diverse peoples such as the [[Maya people|Maya]] and [[Aztec people|Aztec]], and their beliefs have survived and evolved, combined with the beliefs of the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] colonists.

==Depiction in the arts==
Ghosts are prominent in the popular cultures of various nations. The [[ghost story]] is ubiquitous across all cultures from oral [[Folklore|folktales]] to works of literature.

===Renaissance to Romanticism (1500 to 1840)===
[[File:Scrooges third visitor-John Leech,1843.jpg|right|thumb|upright|19th century [[etching]] by [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]] of the [[Ghost of Christmas Present]] as depicted in [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'']]
One of the more recognizable ghosts in [[English literature]] is the [[King Hamlet|shade of Hamlet's murdered father]] in Shakespeare<U+2019>s ''The Tragical History of [[Hamlet, Prince of Denmark]]''. In ''Hamlet'', it is the ghost who demands that [[Prince Hamlet]] investigate his "murder most foul" and seek revenge upon his usurping uncle, [[King Claudius]]. In Shakespeare<U+2019>s ''[[Macbeth]]'', the murdered [[Banquo]] returns as a ghost to the dismay of the title character.

[[File:A Magician by Edward Kelly.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[John Dee]] and [[Edward Kelley]] invoking the spirit of a deceased person (engraving from the ''Astrology'' by [[Ebenezer Sibly]], 1806).]]

In [[English Renaissance theater]], ghosts were often depicted in the garb of the living and even in armor, as with the ghost of Hamlet<U+2019>s father. Armor, being out-of-date by the time of the Renaissance, gave the stage ghost a sense of antiquity.<ref>Ann Jones & Peter Stallybrass, ''Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory'', Cambridge University Press, 2000.</ref> But the sheeted ghost began to gain ground on stage in the 19th century because an armored ghost could not satisfactorily convey the requisite spookiness: it clanked and creaked, and had to be moved about by complicated pulley systems or elevators. These clanking ghosts being hoisted about the stage became objects of ridicule as they became clich<U+00E9>d stage elements. Ann Jones and Peter Stallybrass, in ''Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory'', point out, "In fact, it is as laughter increasingly threatens the Ghost that he starts to be staged not in armor but in some form of 'spirit drapery'." An interesting observation by Jones and Stallybrass is that
{{quote|...at the historical point at which ghosts themselves become increasingly implausible, at least to an educated elite, to believe in them at all it seems to be necessary to assert their immateriality, their invisibility. ... The drapery of ghosts must now, indeed, be as spiritual as the ghosts themselves. This is a striking departure both from the ghosts of the Renaissance stage and from the Greek and Roman theatrical ghosts upon which that stage drew. The most prominent feature of Renaissance ghosts is precisely their gross materiality. They appear to us conspicuously clothed.}}

Ghosts figured prominently in traditional British ballads of the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly the <U+201C>[[Border ballads|Border Ballads]]<U+201D> of the turbulent [[border country]] between England and Scotland. Ballads of this type include ''[[The Unquiet Grave]]'', ''[[The Wife of Usher's Well]]'', and ''[[Sweet William's Ghost]]'', which feature the recurring theme of returning dead lovers or children. In the ballad ''[[King Henry (song)|King Henry]]'', a particularly ravenous ghost devours the king<U+2019>s horse and hounds before forcing the king into bed. The king then awakens to find the ghost transformed into a beautiful woman.<ref>Helen Child Sargent & George Lyman Kittredge, ''English and Scottish Popular Ballads edited from the Collection by Francis James Child'', Houghton Mifflin: New York, 1904.</ref>

One of the key early appearances by ghosts in a gothic tale was ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' by Horace Walpole in 1764.<ref name="Newman, pg. 135">Newman, Kim (ed.) ''BFI Companion to Horror'', Cassell: London, 1996, ISBN 030433216X, p. 135.</ref>

[[Washington Irving]]'s [[short story]] ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1820), based on an earlier German folktale, features a [[Headless Horseman]]. It has been adapted for film and television many times, such as ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'', a successful 1999 feature film.<ref name="sleepyhollow">[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=sleepyhollow.htm Sleepy Hollow] at [[Box Office Mojo]]. Retrieved 29 January 2009.</ref>

===Victorian/Edwardian (1840 to 1920)===
[[File:Pyle pirates ghost.jpg|thumb|The ghost of a pirate, from [[Howard Pyle]]'s ''Book of Pirates'' (1903).]]
The "classic" ghost story arose during the Victorian period, and included authors such as [[M. R. James]], [[Sheridan Le Fanu]], [[Violet Hunt]], and [[Henry James]]. Classic ghost stories were influenced by the [[gothic fiction]] tradition, and contain elements of folklore and psychology. M. R. James summed up the essential elements of a ghost story as, <U+201C>Malevolence and terror, the glare of evil faces, <U+2018>the stony grin of unearthly malice', pursuing forms in darkness, and 'long-drawn, distant screams', are all in place, and so is a modicum of blood, shed with deliberation and carefully husbanded...<U+201D><ref>James, M. R. "Some Remarks on Ghost Stories", The Bookman, December 1929.</ref>

Famous literary apparitions from this period are the ghosts of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', in which [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] is helped to see the error of his ways by the ghost of his former colleague [[Jacob Marley]], and the ghosts of Christmas Past, Christmas Present and Christmas Yet to Come.

[[Oscar Wilde]]'s comedy ''[[The Canterville Ghost]]'' has been adapted for film and television on several occasions. Henry James's ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]'' has also appeared in a number of adaptations, notably the film ''[[The Innocents (1961 film)|The Innocents]]'' and [[Benjamin Britten]]'s opera ''[[The Turn of the Screw (opera)|The Turn of the Screw]]''.

[[Oscar Telgmann]]'s opera ''[[Leo, the Royal Cadet]]'' (1885) includes ''Judge's Song'' about a ghost at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in Kingston, Ontario.<ref>Cameron, George Frederick (1889) [http://www.archive.org/details/cihm_06551 Leo, the Royal cadet]</ref>

''[[Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things]]'' is a 1904 collection of [[Kaidan|Japanese ghost stories]] collected by [[Lafcadio Hearn]], and later made into a film.

In the United States, prior to and during the First World War, folklorists [[Olive Dame Campbell]] and [[Cecil Sharp]] collected ballads from the people of the Appalachian Mountains, which included ghostly themes such as ''[[The Wife of Usher's Well]]'', ''[[The Suffolk Miracle]]'', ''[[The Unquiet Grave]]'', and ''[[The Cruel Ship's Carpenter]]''. The theme of these ballads was often the return of a dead lover. These songs were variants of traditional British ballads handed down by generations of mountaineers descended from the people of the Anglo-Scottish border region.<ref>Campbell, Olive Dame and Sharp, Cecil James ''English Folk Songs From The Southern Appalachians'', G. Putnam's Sons: New York, 1917</ref>

===Modern Era (1920 to 1970)===
Professional parapsychologists and <U+201C>ghosts hunters<U+201D>, such as [[Harry Price]], active in the 1920s and 1930s, and [[Peter Underwood (parapsychologist)|Peter Underwood]], active in the 1940s and 1950s, published accounts of their experiences with ostensibly true ghost stories such as Price's ''The Most Haunted House in England'', and Underwood's ''Ghosts of Borley'' (both recounting experiences at [[Borley Rectory]]). The writer [[Frank Edwards (writer and broadcaster)|Frank Edwards]] delved into ghost stories in his books of his, like "Stranger than Science."

Children<U+2019>s benevolent ghost stories became popular, such as [[Casper the Friendly Ghost]], created in the 1930s and appearing in comics, [[animated cartoon]]s, and eventually a 1995 feature film.

[[No<U+00EB>l Coward]]'s play ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'', later made into a [[Blithe Spirit (film)|film]], places a more humorous slant on the phenomenon of haunting of individuals and specific locations.

With the advent of motion pictures and television, screen depictions of ghosts became common, and spanned a variety of genres; the works of Shakespeare, Dickens and Wilde have all been made into cinematic versions. Novel-length tales have been difficult to adapt to cinema, although that of ''[[The Haunting of Hill House]]'' to ''[[The Haunting (1963 film)|The Haunting]]'' in 1963 is an exception.<ref name="Newman, pg. 135"/>

Sentimental depictions during this period were more popular in cinema than horror, and include the 1947 film ''[[The Ghost and Mrs. Muir]]'', which was later adapted to television with a successful 1968<U+2013>70 [[The Ghost & Mrs. Muir (TV series)|TV series]].<ref name="Newman, pg. 135" /> Genuine [[psychological horror]] films from this period include 1944's ''[[The Uninvited (1944 film)|The Uninvited]]'', and 1945's ''[[Dead of Night]]''.

{{Main|List of ghost films}}

===Post-modern (1970<U+2013>present)===
The 1970s saw screen depictions of ghosts diverge into distinct genres of the romantic and horror. A common theme in the romantic genre from this period is the ghost as a benign guide or messenger, often with unfinished business, such as 1989's ''[[Field of Dreams]]'', the 1990 film ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', and the 1993 comedy ''[[Heart and Souls]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE3DE1339F93BA3575BC0A965958260|title=FILM; When It Comes to the Hereafter, Romance and Sentiment Rule|last=Chanko|first=Kenneth M.|date=August 8, 1993|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref> In the horror genre, 1980's ''[[The Fog]]'', and the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' series of films from the 1980s and 1990s are notable examples of the trend for the merging of ghost stories with scenes of physical violence.<ref name="Newman, pg. 135"/>

Popularised in such films as the 1984 comedy ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', [[ghost hunting]] became a hobby for many who formed ghost hunting societies to explore reportedly haunted places. The ghost hunting theme has been featured in [[Reality television|reality television series]], such as ''[[Ghost Adventures]]'', ''[[Ghost Hunters]]'', ''[[Ghost Hunters International]]'', ''[[Ghost Lab]]'', ''[[Most Haunted]]'' and ''[[A Haunting]]''. It is also represented in children's television by such programs as ''[[The Ghost Hunter]]'' and ''[[Ghost Trackers]]''. Ghost hunting also gave rise to multiple guidebooks to haunted locations, and ghost hunting "how-to" manuals.

The 1990s saw a return to classic "gothic" ghosts, whose dangers were more psychological than physical. Examples of films from this period include 1999's ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' and ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]]''.

[[Asian cinema]] has also produced [[horror film]]s about ghosts, such as the 1998 Japanese film ''[[Ring (film)|Ringu]]'' (remade in the US as ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'' in 2002), and the Pang brothers' 2002 film ''[[The Eye (2002 film)|The Eye]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E1D61330F93BA35755C0A9659C8B63|title=Why Asian Ghost Stories Are the Best |last=Rafferty|first=Terence|date=June 8, 2003|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref>
[[Indian ghost movies]] are popular not just in India, but in the Middle East, Africa, South East Asia and other parts of the world. Some Indian ghost movies such as the comedy / horror film ''[[Chandramukhi]]'' have been commercial successes, dubbed into several languages.<ref name=behind>{{cite web

Generally the films are based on the experiences of modern people who are unexpectedly exposed to ghosts. They usually draw on traditional Indian literature or folklore, but in some cases are remakes of western films, such as ''[[Anjaane (2005 film)|Anjaane]]'', based on [[Alejandro Amen<U+00E1>bar]]'s ghost story ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]]''.<ref name=anjaane>{{cite web

In fictional television programming, ghosts have been explored in series such as ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'' and ''[[Medium (TV show)|Medium]]''. In animated fictional television programming, ghosts have served as the central element in series such as ''[[Casper the Friendly Ghost|Casper]]'', ''[[Danny Phantom]]'', and ''[[Scooby-Doo]]''. Various other television shows have depicted ghosts as well.<!-- please do not add a list of trivia.-->

==Metaphorical usages==
[[Nietzsche]] argued that people generally wear prudent [[Persona (psychology)|masks]] in company; but that an alternative strategy for social interaction is to present oneself as an absence, as a social ghost - <U+201C>One reaches out for us but gets no hold of us<U+201D><ref>Quoted in Gary Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2003) p. 235</ref> - something later echoed (if with a less positive spin) by [[C. G. Jung]]<ref>C. G. Jung, ''Two Essays on Analytical Psychology'' (London 1953) p. 197</ref>

[[Nick Harkaway]] considered that we all carry a host of ghosts in our heads, in the form of impressions of past acquaintances <U+2013> ghosts that represent our maps of other people in the world: our reference points.<ref>Nick Harkaway, ''The Gone-Away World'' (2008) p. 380</ref>

[[Object relations theory]] sees our personalities as formed by [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting off]] aspects of ourselves we find incompatible; whereupon we may be haunted in later life by such ghosts of our alternate selves.<ref>Michael Parsons, ''The Dove that Returns, the Dove that Vanishes'' (2000) p. 83-4</ref>
