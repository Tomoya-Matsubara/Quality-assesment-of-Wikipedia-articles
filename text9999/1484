"'''Salute'''" is a song by British girl group [[Little Mix]] for their [[Salute (Little Mix album)|second studio album of the same name]] (2013). It was released on 30 May 2014 as the album's third single. It was co-written by the group (Perrie Edwards, Jesy Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jade Thirlwall) with [[TMS (production team)|TMS]] (Thomas Barnes, Peter Kelleher and Ben Kohn) and Maegan Cottone, and produced by TMS. Lyrically, "Salute" is a [[girl-power]] song, being called "a call to arms for women everywhere to stand up and fight whatever imaginary enemy is standing in their way," with military metaphors, war sirens, and [[hip-hop]] and [[trap (music genre)|trap]] influences, drawing comparisons to [[Destiny's Child]] and [[Beyonc<U+00E9>]]'s "[[Run the World (Girls)]]". 

Music critics gave the song positive reviews, with most praising its empowering lyrics and military-inspired drum beats. Some even noticed it would fit perfectly as an opening song for the tour, as well as being one of the strongest tracks of 2013. The song became a top-ten hit on the charts of [[Scotland]] and [[United Kingdom]], becoming the band's sixth top-ten single in the UK, while reaching the top-twenty in [[Ireland]] and top-forty in [[Belgium]]. A music video for the song features the band dancing in an underground warehouse with an entourage of male dancers, some of whom are on leads. To promote the song, the band performed in many TV shows, including ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' and the [[Today (U.S. TV program)|''Today Show'']].
