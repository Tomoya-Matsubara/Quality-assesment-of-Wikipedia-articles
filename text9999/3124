{{otherships|HMS Curacoa}}

'''HMS''' '''''Curacoa''''' was a [[C class cruiser|"C" class]] [[light cruiser]] named after the island in the [[Caribbean Sea]], more usually spelled [[Cura<U+00E7>ao]], and part of the ''Ceres'' group of cruisers.  She became one of the major accidental losses of the [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War II]]. The wrecksite is designated as a ''protected place'' under the [[Protection of Military Remains Act 1986]].<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/uksi_20080950_en_1 Designation under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986] by [[Statutory Instrument|SI]]2008/950, [[Office of Public Sector Information]], [[The National Archives]].  Retrieved [[2008-07-17]].</ref>

During the last days of [[World War I]] she served with the [[Grand Fleet]]. She stared along with 4 other Royal Naval ships, and played a German battlecruiser in the 1935 film ''[[Brown on Resolution (film)|Brown on Resolution]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwar1.com/tripwire/smtw0708.htm|title=St. Mihiel Trip-Wire: July 2008|publisher=WorldWar1.com|author=Great War Society|date=July 2008|accessdate=2009-08-10}}</ref> Later in 1939 she was selected for conversion to an Anti-Aircraft Cruiser and underwent a refit at the HM Dockyard Catham.<ref name="NHN">{{cite web|url=http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-06CL-Curacoa.htm|title=Service Histories of the Royal Navy Warships in World War 2|author=Lt Cdr Geoffrey B Mason RN|date=2004|publisher=Navy-Histories.net|accessdate=2009-08-10}}</ref> She would go on to serve with the [[Home Fleet]] during the Norwegian campaign in 1940. On April 24th, 1940 she sustained heavy damage from aerial bombing, suffering 30 causalities, and was withdrawn back to Catham for repairs.<ref name="NHN" /> In August of the same year, she returned to active duty with the Nore Command for convoy defense through to 1942. She was adopted by the civil community of [[Wolverhampton]] in Warship Week, March 1942.<ref name="NHN" />

On 2 October 1942 she was engaged in convoy escort duties with the ocean liner [[RMS Queen Mary|RMS ''Queen Mary'']] who was transporting 20,000 [[United States|American]] troops to join the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/13/a2733013.shtml|title=Archives: HMS Curacao Tragedy|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=11 June 2004|author=Brighton CSV Media Clubhouse|accessdate=2009-08-10}}</ref>  Both ships were on continuous evasive zigzagging courses about 60 km north of the coast of Ireland when the Queen Mary cut across the path of Curacoa with insufficient clearance. The Queen Mary struck the Curacoa amidships at a speed of 28 knots, cutting the Curacoa in two. Separated by about 100 yards, she sank instantly with 338 casualties.  Due to the risk of [[U-boats]], the Queen Mary did not assist in rescue operations, and steamed on with a fractured stem. Hours later, the naval lead ship in the convoy returned to rescued 99 survivors (including Captain John W. Boutwood, RN) from the water.<ref>[http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/1199.html uboat.net - Allied Warships - Light cruiser HMS Curacoa of the Ceres class<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The incident was due to several factors. The captain of the Queen Mary made the assumption that her escort ship would track her course change and adjust accordingly.<ref name="HIST">[http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=89667 "Queen Mary / Curacoa Crash"], [[Disasters of the Century]]. [[History Television]], Canada.com Network. [[List_of_assets_owned_by_Canwest#CW_Media_Inc.|CanWest Media Inc]], 2009.</ref> On the other ship, the captain of the Curacoa assumed the rules of sea faring which states that an overtaking ship must yield. On board both ships, the seemingly converging course was reported, and a course correction issued by the First Officer on the Queen Mary, were dismissed by the captains.<ref name="HIST" />

The loss was never reported until after the war ended where the navy immediately pressed charges against the [[Cunard White Star Line]].<ref name="HIST" /> A year later the High Court Justice ruled mostly in favour of the liner company giving two thirds of the blame to the Admiralty and one third to Cunard White Star Line.<ref name="HIST" /> This court ruling would later be important for the following civil lawsuits filed by the relatives of the deceased against the liner. This led to significant changes in navy policy including the suspension of naval escorts for passenger liners.<ref name="HIST" />
