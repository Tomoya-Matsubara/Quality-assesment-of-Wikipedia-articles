The '''Dharwar craton''' in [[South India]] presents a natural cross-section of late-[[Archaean]] continental crust. There are three main structural zones: a root zone of highly [[heterogeneous]] [[petrology]] (from [[monzonite]] to [[granite]]) and texture ([[phenocryst]] accumulation), a "channel zone" where evidences of large scale [[magma]] ascent can be observed, and a zone of superficial [[intrusion]]s, consisting in independent [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]] intrusive bodies. In the root zone, [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]-derived magma underwent [[Fractional crystallization (geology)|fractional crystallisation]] which was followed by mingling between the residual liquids and melts generated by [[anatexis]] of the surrounding [[gneiss]]ic [[Basement rock|basement]].
