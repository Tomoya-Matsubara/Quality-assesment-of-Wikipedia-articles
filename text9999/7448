'''Systemin''' is a [[plant peptide hormone]] involved in the wound response in the [[Solanaceae]] plant family, it was the first [[plant hormone]] that was proven to be a [[peptide]]. It was discovered in tomato leaves in 1991, since then other peptides, with similar functions have been identified in tomato and outside of the Solanaceae. [[Hydroxyproline]]-rich [[glycoprotein|glycopeptides]] were found in [[Nicotiana|tobacco]] in 2001 and AtPEPs were found in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' in 2006. Their precursors are found both in the [[cytoplasm]] and [[plant cell wall|cell wall]]s of [[plant cell]]s, upon insect damage, the precursors are processed to produce one or more mature peptides. The [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] for systemin was first thought to be the same as the [[brassinolide]] receptor but this is now uncertain. The [[signal transduction]] processes that occur after the peptides bind are similar to the [[cytokine]]-mediated [[inflammation|inflammatory immune response]] in animals. Early experiments showed that systemin travelled around the plant after insects had damaged the plant, activating [[systemic acquired resistance]], now it is thought that it increases the production of [[jasmonic acid]] causing the same result. The main function of systemins and  is to coordinate defensive responses against [[insect]] [[herbivory|herbivores]] but they also affect [[Plant_development#Plant_development|plant development]]. Systemin induces the production of [[protease inhibitor (biology)|protease inhibitors]] which protect against insect herbivores, other peptides activate [[defensin]]s and modify root growth. They have also been shown to affect plants' responses to salt stress and UV radiation. AtPEPs have been shown to affect resistance against [[oomycete]]s and may allow ''A. thaliana'' to distinguish between different pathogens. In ''[[Nicotiana attenuata]]'', some of the peptides have stopped being involved in defensive roles and instead affect [[Flower#Morphology|flower morphology]].

In 1991, an 18 amino acid [[polypeptide]] was isolated from tomato leaves, that induced the production of [[protease inhibitor]] proteins (PIs) in response to wounding. Experiments using synthetic [[isotopic labeling#Radioisotopic labeling|radio-labelled]] forms of the polypeptide demonstrated that it was able to travel systemically through the plant and induce PI production in unwounded leaves. Because of the systemic nature of the wounding signal, it was named systemin, it was the first polypeptide found to function as a hormone in plants.<ref name=four>C.A. Ryan and G.

===Peptides with similar functions===
In 2001, biologically active [[hydroxyproline]]-rich [[glycoprotein|glycopeptides]] were isolated from tobacco which activated the production of protease inhibitors in a similar way to systemin in tomatoes.<ref name=three>{{cite doi|10.1007/978-1-4020-8182-8_15}} ISBN: 978-1-4020-8181-1</ref> Although they are structurally unrelated to systemins, their similar function resulted in them being named hydroxyproline-rich systemins (HypSys). Following the initial discovery other HypSys peptides were found in tomato, ''[[Petunia]]'' and [[black nightshade]].<ref name=four/><ref name=six>{{cite doi|10.1104/pp.109.138669}}</ref><ref name=seven>{{cite doi|10.1074/jbc.M701543200}}</ref> In 2007, HypSys were found outside the Solanaceae, in sweet potato (''[[Ipomoea batatas]]'')<ref name=eight>{{cite doi|10.1074/jbc.M709002200}}</ref> and sequence analysis identified HypSys analogs in poplar (''[[Populus trichocarpa]]'') and coffee (''[[Coffea canephora]]'').<ref name=nine>{{cite pmid|19704502}}</ref> Systemins are highly conserved between species, whereas HypSys are more divergent but all contain a conserved [[proline]] or [[hydroxyproline]]-rich central domain.

In 2006, AtPEP1, a 23 amino acid polypeptide was isolated from ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'', which was found to activate components of the [[innate immune system|innate immune response]]. Unlike HypSys, AtPEP1 is not [[Posttranslational modification|post-translationally modified]] by [[hydroxylation]] or [[glycosylation]]. Six [[paralog]]s of the precursor have been identified in ''A. thaliana'' as well as [[ortholog]]s in [[grape]], [[rice]], [[maize]], [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[canola]], [[soybean]], [[medicago]] and [[poplar]], although the activity of these orthologs has not been tested in assays. The predicted structures of the paralogs of AtPEP1 are varied within ''A. thaliana'' but all contain a SSGR/KxGxxN  [[sequence motif]]. The orthologs identified in other species are more varied but still contain components of the sequence motif.<ref name=ten>{{cite doi|10.1073/pnas.0603727103}}</ref>

==Localisation and precursors==
Systemin and AtPEP1 are found in the cell [[cytosol]]. The [[Protein precursor|precursor]] to tomato systemin is [[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] as a 200 amino acid polypeptide.<ref name=four/> It does not contain a putative [[protein targeting|signal sequence]] suggesting that it is synthesised on free [[ribosome]]s in the cytosol.<ref name=eleven>{{cite pmid|14534786}}</ref> The precursor to AtPEP1 is a 92 amino acid polypeptide and also lacks a signal sequence.<ref name=ten/> In tomato, [[mRNA]] encoding the precursor for systemin is present at very low levels in unwounded leaves but accumulates upon wounding, particularly in the cells surrounding the sieve elements of the [[phloem]] in vascular bundles of mid veins. The precursor accumulates exclusively in the phloem [[parenchyma]] cells of leaves in tomato after wounding. The precursor to potato systemin is also localised in a similar manner suggesting it is under the same cell-type-specific regulation in both species.<ref name=eleven/>

HypSys are localised in the [[plant cell wall|cell wall]]. The precursor for tobacco HypSys is transcribed as a 165 amino acid polypeptide which has no structural homology to the precursor for systemin in tomato.<ref name=twelve>{{cite doi|10.1007/BF03030740}}</ref> The structural properties of HypSys, containing hydroxyproline and being glycosylated, indicate that they are synthesised through the [[Secretory pathway|secretory system]].<ref name=four /> The precursor to HypSys in tomato is a 146 amino acid polypeptide, exclusively synthesised within the vascular bundles of leaves and [[petiole]]s associated with parenchyma cells of phloem bundles. Unlike systemin, it is primarily associated with the cell wall. The precursors to HypSys appear to represent a distinct subfamily of hydroxyproline-rich proteins found in cell walls. Upon wounding it is thought that a protease from the cytosol, the cell wall matrix, or the pathogen, processes the precursor producing active HypSys peptides.<ref name=thirteen>{{cite pmid|16126900}}</ref>          

===Processing of precursors===
The precursors for systemin and AtPEP1 are both processed to yield one active peptide from the [[C-terminus]] of the precursor.<ref name=four/><ref name=ten /> It has been speculated that ProAtPEP1 is processed by CONSTITUTIVE DISEASE RESISTANCE 1, an [[apoplast]]ic [[aspartate protease|aspartic protease]].<ref name=two>{{cite pmid|18614393}}</ref> The precursors to HypSys are processed into more than one active peptide. In tobacco, it is processed into two peptides, in petunia into three, and in sweet potato, possibly into six.<ref name=seven /><ref name=eight /><ref name=fourteen>{{cite pmid|10708853}}</ref> At 291 amino acids long, the precursor to HypSys in sweet potato is the longest precursor described.<ref name=nine /> The production of multiple signalling peptides from one precursor is a common feature found in animals.<ref name=three />

==Receptors==
Exceedingly small amounts of tomato systemin are active, [[femto-]][[Molar concentration|molar]] concentrations of the peptide are sufficient to elicit a response at the whole plant level, making it one of the most potent gene activators identified.<ref name=three /><ref name=fifteen>{{cite doi|10.1105/tpc.006379}}</ref>
A [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] for tomato systemin was identified as a 160K[[Dalton|Da]] [[leucine-rich repeat]] receptor like [[kinase]] (LRR-RLK), SR160. After being isolated it was found that was very similar in structure to BRI1 from ''A. thaliana'', the receptor that [[brassinolide]]s bind to on the cell membrane. This was the first receptor which was found to be able to bind both a [[steroid]] and a peptide [[ligand]] and also to be involved in both defensive and developmental responses.<ref name=three /> Recent studies have found that the initial conclusion that BRI1 is the receptor for tomato systemin may be incorrect. In ''cu3'' mutants of tomato, a [[null allele]] with a [[stop codon]] present in the extracellular LRR domain of BRI1 prevents the receptor from being localised correctly and it also lacks the kinase domain, required for signalling.<ref name=fifteen /> These mutants are insensitive to brassinolide yet still respond to tomato systemin by producing protease inhibitors and causing an alkalisation response. This led Holton ''et al.'' to suggest that there is another mechanism by which systemin is perceived.<ref name=sixteen>{{cite pmid|2633960}}</ref> Further investigation showed that binding of systemin to BRI1 does not cause the receptor to become phosphorylated, as when brassinolides bind, suggesting that it does not transduce a signal. When BRI1 is [[gene silencing|silenced]] in tomato, the plants have a similar phenotype to ''cu3'' mutants yet are still able to respond normally to systemin, strengthening the view that BRI1 is not the systemin receptor.<ref name=seventeen>{{cite doi|10.1007/s11103-009-9494-x}}</ref> 

In 1994, tomato systemin was found to bind to a 50KDa protein in the cell membrane of tomato. The protein has a structure similar to proteases of the Kex2p-like [[prohormone convertase]]s. This led Schaller and Ryan to suggest that it is not a receptor, but instead is involved in the processing of ProSys into the active form, or the degradation of Sys. Synthetic forms of tomato systemin, with substituted amino acids at the predicted [[dibasic]] cleavage site, remained stable in cell cultures for longer than the native form.<ref name=eighteen>A. Schaller and C. A. Ryan, Identification of a 50-kDa systemin-binding protein in tomato plasma membranes having Kex2p-like properties, ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'' '''91 '''(1994), pp. 11802-11806</ref> Later studies have noted that the enzymes responsible for processing ProSys remain unidentified.<ref name=fourteen /> No further research has been reported on the 50KDa protein to date, and the gene has not been identified.<ref name=seventeen />

No receptors for HypSys have so far been reported, but it is thought that they are perceived on the cell membrane by a LRR-RLK.<ref name=eight />

The receptor for AtPep1 has been identified as a 170KDa LRR-RLK and has been named AtPEPR1. AtPep1 is active at 0.1 [[nano-]]molar (nM) concentrations and the receptor saturates at 1nM. An analysis of the structure of the AtPEPR1 receptor has shown that it is a member of the LRR XI subfamily of LRR-RLKs in ''A. thaliana'' which includes the receptor for another peptide hormone [[CLAVATA3]]. Transforming tobacco cell cultures with ''AtPEPR1'' allowed them to respond to AtPep1 in an alkalisation assay, whereas normal tobacco did not show such a response.<ref name=nineteen>Y.'' ''Yamaguchi, ''et al.,'' The cell surface leucine-rich repeat receptor for AtPep1, an endogenous peptide elicitor in Arabidopsis, is functional in transgenic tobacco cells, ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'' '''103''' (2006), 10104-10109</ref> BRI1-associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1) is an LRR-RLK found in ''A. thaliana'', which has been proposed to function as an [[adaptor protein]] that is required for the proper functioning of other RLKs. [[Two-hybrid screening|Yeast two-hybrid assay]]s have shown that AtPEPR1 and its closest analog, AtPEPR2, interact with BAK1.<ref name=twenty>S. Postel ''et al.,'' The multifunctional leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase BAK1 is implicated in Arabidopsis development and immunity, ''European Journal of Cell Biology'' '''89''' (2010), pp. 169-174</ref>

==Signal transduction==
[[File:Sytemin signalling.png|thumb|Proposed system of [[signal transduction]] for systemin.<ref name=four /> MAPKs = [[Mitogen-activated protein kinase]]s PL = [[Phospholipase]] JA = [[Jasmonic acid]] LA = [[Linolenic acid]]]] 

Although the receptors for systemins and HypSys remain poorly understood, we have a better understanding of the [[signal transduction]] that occurs once the peptide had bound to its receptor. [[Jasmonic acid]] is an essential, albeit late component, in the systemin and wound-signalling pathways. In tomato, the signal is transduced from the receptor by [[mitogen-activated protein kinase]]s (MAPKs).<ref name=twenty1>{{cite pmid|1924534}}</ref> Cosilencing of two MAPKs, MPK1 and MPK2, in tomato compromised their defence response against insect larvae compared to [[wild type]] plants. Cosilencing these genes also decreased production of jasmonic acid and of jasmonic acid-dependent defence genes. Applying [[methyl jasmonate]] to cosilenced plants rescued them, indicating that jasmonates are the signal responsible for causing changes in gene expression.<ref name=twenty1/> The alkalisation of the apoplast is a downstream effect of signalling processing by MAPKs. Applying [[fusicoccin]], which activates the [[V-ATPase|H<sup>+</sup> ATPase]] inhibited by systemin, along with systemin still activates MAPKs, even though the pH of the apoplast does not change.<ref name=twenty2>{{cite pmid|17109147}}</ref>

Within minutes of systemin perception, the [[cytosol]]ic [[calcium in biology|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]] concentration increases, and [[linolenic acid]] is released from cell membranes after a [[phospholipase]] has been activated. Linolenic acid is then converted to jasmonic acid via the [[octadecanoid pathway]] and jasmonic acid activates defensive genes.<ref name=three/> Production of methyl jasmonate is induced by systemins and also upregulates systemin precursor genes creating a feedback loop, amplifying the defensive signal. Methyl jasmonate is volatile and can therefore activate [[systemic acquired resistance]] in neighbouring plants, preparing their defences for attack. These signalling events are analogous to the [[cytokine]]-mediated [[inflammation|inflammatory immune response]] in animals. When the inflammatory response is activated in animals, MAPKs are activated which in turn activate phospholipases. Lipids in the membrane are converted to [[arachidonic acid]] and then to [[prostaglandins]], which are analogs of jasmonic acid.<ref name=four /> Both pathways can be inhibited by [[suramin]].<ref name="Stratmann">{{cite pmid|10922047}}</ref>

Early experiments with [[isotopic labeling#Radioisotopic labeling|radiolabelled]] systemin in tomato demonstrated that it is transported through the phloem sap in tomato plants and was therefore thought to be the systemic signal that activated systemic acquired resistance.<ref name=three /> This view was challenged by grafting experiments which showed that mutants deficient in jasmonic acid biosynthesis and perception were unable to activate systemic acquired resistance. It is now thought that jasmonic acid is the systemic signal and that systemin upregulates the pathways for jasmonic acid synthesis.<ref name=three />

==Functions==
===Defence===
[[File:Tomato Hornworm.jpg|thumb|Systemin activates processes which help tomato deter insect herbivores, such as this [[hornworm]]]]
Systemin plays a critical role in defence signalling in tomato. In promotes the synthesis of over 20 defence-related proteins, mainly antinutritional proteins, signaling pathway proteins and proteases.<ref name=fourteen/> When systemin was [[gene silencing|silenced]], production of protease inhibitors in tomato was severely impaired and larvae feeding on the plants grew three times as fast.<ref name=twenty3>M. Orozco-Cardenas ''et al.'', Expression of an antisense prosystemin gene in tomato plants, ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'' '''90''' (1993), pp. 8273-8276</ref> HypSys caused similar changes in gene expression in tobacco, for example [[polyphenol oxidase]] activity increased ten-fold in tobacco leaves and protease inhibitors caused a 30% decrease in [[chymotrypsin]] activity within three days of wounding.<ref name=twelve/> When HypSys was over-expressed in tobacco, larvae feeding on transgenic plants weighed half as much after ten days feeding, as those feeding on normal plants.<ref name=twenty4>F. Ren and Y. Lu, Overexpression of tobacco hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptide systemin precursor A gene in transgenic tobacco enhances resistance against Helicoverpa armigera larvae, ''Plant Science'' '''171''' (2006), pp. 286<U+2013>292</ref> The concentration of [[hydrogen peroxide]] increased in the vasculature tissues when the production of systemin, HypSys or AtPep1 is induced, this may also be involved in initiating systemic acquired resistance.<ref name=four/><ref name=one>U. Conrath, Systemic acquired resistance, ''Plant Signalling & Behaviour'' '''1''' (2006), pp. 179-184</ref>

Tomato plants over-expressing systemin also accumulated HypSys but did not if the systemin precursor was silenced, indicating that in tomato, HypSys is controlled by systemin. Each of the three HypSys peptides in tomato is able to activate the synthesis and accumulation of protease inhibitors.<ref name=thirteen/> When HypSys is silenced the production of protease inhibitors induced by wounding is halved compared to wild type plants indicating that both systemin and HypSys are required for a strong defence response against herbivores in tomato.<ref name=twenty5>J. Narvaez-Vasquez ''et al.,'' Systemic wound signaling in tomato leaves is cooperatively regulated by systemin and hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptide signals, ''Plant Molecular Biology'' 65 (2007), pp. 711-718</ref>

When applied through cut [[petiole]]s in [[petunia]], HypSys did not induce the production of protease inhibitors, but instead increased expression of [[defensin]], a gene which produces a protein that inserts into microbial membranes, forming a pore.<ref name=seven/> Defensin expression is also induced by AtPEP1.<ref name=ten/>

Tomato plants over-expressing systemin produced more [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs) when wounded than normal plants and [[parasitoid wasp]]s find them more attractive, predating more insects. This demonstrates that systemin upregulates the expression of genes involved in the production of VOCs. Such a response is crucial if antinutritional defences are to be effective, since without predators, developing insects would consume more plant material while completing their development.<ref name=twenty6>G. Corrado ''et al.'', Systemin regulates both systemic and volatile signaling in tomato plants, ''Journal of Chemical Ecology'' '''33''' (2007), pp. 669-681</ref> It is likely that VOC production is upregulated through the [[oxylipin]] pathway that synthesises jasmonic acid and other volatile [[aldehyde]]s and [[alcohol]]s that function in wound healing.<ref name=twenty7>R.A. Creelman and J.E. Mullet, Biosynthesis and action of jasmonates in plants, ''Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology'' '''48''' (1997), 355-381</ref>

Different AtPeps may allow ''A. thaliana'' to distinguish between different pathogens. When inoculated with a [[fungus]], [[oomycete]] and a [[bacterium]], the increases in AtPep expression varied depending on the pathogen. ''A. thaliana'' overexpressing ''AtProPep1'' was more resistant to the oomycete ''[[Phythium irregulare]]''.<ref name=ten/>

Silencing systemin did not affect the ability of black nightshade to resist [[herbivory]] and, when competing against normal plants, silenced plants produced more above-ground biomass and berries. Upon herbivory, systemin was down-regulated in black nightshade in contrast to the other peptides which are up-regulated after herbivory.<ref name=twenty8>S. Schmidt and I.T. Baldwin, Down-regulation of systemin after herbivory is associated with increased root allocation and competitive ability in Solanum nigrum, ''Oecologia '''''159''' (2009), 473-482</ref> By contrast HypSys were up-regulated and activated the synthesis of protease inhibitors.<ref name=six /> The down-regulation of systemin was associated with increased root mass but did not decrease shoot mass, demonstrating that systemin can cause developmental changes as a result of herbivory, allowing the plant to tolerate, rather than directly resist attack. Tomato roots were also affected by tomato systemin, with root growth increasing at high tomato systemin concentrations. By allocating more resources to the roots, plants under attack are thought to store carbon and then use it to re-grow when the attack ends.<ref name=twenty8/> Overexpressing ''AtPEP1'' also increased root and shoot biomass in ''A. thaliana''.<ref name=ten/>

===Abiotic stress resistance===
Overexpression of systemin and HypSys has been found to improve plants' resistance to abiotic stresses including salt stress and UV radiation.<ref name=twenty9>{{cite pmid|19843237}}</ref> When systemin was over-expressed in tomato, transgenic plants had lower [[stomata]]l conductance than normal plants. When grown in salt solutions, transgenic plants had higher stomatal conductances, lower leaf concentrations of [[abscisic acid]] and [[proline]] and a higher biomass. These findings suggest that the over-expression of systemin either allowed the plants to adapt to salt stress more efficiently or that they perceived a less stressful environment.<ref name=twenty9/> Similarly, wounded tomato plants were less susceptible to salt stress than unwounded plants. This may be because wounding decreases the growth of the plant and therefore slows the uptake of toxic ions into the roots.<ref name=twenty9/> An analysis of salt-induced changes in gene expression found that the differences measured between the transgenic and normal plants could not be accounted for by changes in conventional salt stress-induced pathways. Instead Orsini ''et al.'' proposed that jasmonic acid may be responsible by activating defence responses which include the plant minimising water loss and diverting pathways away from producing [[compatible solute]]s towards defensive compounds.<ref name=twenty9/>

Plants grown under [[UVB]] light are more resistant to insect herbivory compared with plants grown under filters that exclude the radiation. When tomato plants are exposed to a pulse of UVB radiation and then weakly wounded, PIs accumulate throughout the plant. By themselves, neither the radiation nor weak wounding is sufficient to induce systemic PI accumulation. Tomato cell cultures respond similarly, with systemin and UVB acting together to activate MAPKs. Short pulses of UVB also cause alkalisation of the culturing medium.<ref name=thirty>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.tplants.2003.09.011}}</ref>

===Development===
In ''[[Nicotiana attenuata]]'' HypSys is known to not be involved in defence against insect herbivores. Silencing and over-expression of HypSys does not affect the feeding performance of larvae compared to normal plants.<ref name=thirty1>B. Berger and I.T. Baldwin, The hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptide systemin precursor NapreproHypSys does not play a central role in Nicotiana attenuata's anti-herbivore defense responses, ''Plant Cell and Environment'' '''30''' (2007), pp. 1450-1464</ref> Berger silenced HypSys and found that it caused changes in [[Flower#Morphology|flower morphology]] which reduced the efficiency of [[self-pollination]]. The flowers had [[pistil]]s that protruded beyond their [[anther]]s, a similar phenotype to CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE1-silenced plants which lack a jasmonate receptor. Measurement of jasmonate levels in the flowers revealed that they were lower than in normal plants. The authors suggested that HypSys peptides in ''N. attenuata'' have diversified from their function as defence related peptides to being involved in controlling flower morphology. The signalling processes remain similar however, being mediated through jasmonates.<ref name=thirty2>B.B. Ian and I.T. Baldwin, Silencing the hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptide systemin precursor in two accessions of Nicotiana attenuata alters flower morphology and rates of self-pollination, ''Plant Physiology'' '''149''' (2009), pp. 1690-1700</ref>

Systemin also increases root growth in ''[[Solanum pimpinellifolium]]'' suggesting that it may also play some role in [[Plant_development#Plant_development|plant development]]<!-- note this stupid way of linking is needed -->.<ref name="Holtona">{{cite journal|last=Holtona|first=Nicholas |coauthors=Ana Ca<U+00F1>o-Delgadoc, Kate Harrisona, Teresa Montoyab, Joanne Choryc and Gerard J.
