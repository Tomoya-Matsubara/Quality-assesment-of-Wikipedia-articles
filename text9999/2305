The '''Witch trials in the Early Modern period'''  were a period of [[witch hunts]] between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries,<ref>[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 01.</ref> when across [[Early Modern Europe]], and to some extent in the European colonies in North America, there was a widespread hysteria that malevolent [[Satanism|Satanic]] [[witchcraft|witches]] were operating as an organized threat to [[Christendom]]. Those accused of witchcraft were portrayed as being worshippers of the [[Devil]], who engaged in such acts as malevolent [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]], [[cannibalism]] and [[orgies]] at meetings known as [[Witches' Sabbath]]s. Many people were subsequently accused of being witches, and were put on trial for the crime, with varying punishments being applicable in different regions and at different times.

The witch trials originated in south-eastern France during the fourteenth century, before spreading through central Europe and then into other parts of the continent and also amongst European colonies in North America. While early trials fall still within the [[Late Medieval period]], the peak of the witch hunt was between 1580 and 1630. The last known trial occurred in 1782.<ref name="Thurston 2001 Page 79">[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 79.</ref> Amongst the most well known of these trials was the Scottish [[North Berwick witch trials]], Swedish [[Tors<U+00E5>ker witch trials]] and the American [[Salem witch trials]]. Among the largest and most notable was the [[Trier witch trials]] (1581<U+2013>1593), the [[Fulda witch trials]] (1603<U+2013>1606), the [[W<U+00FC>rzburg witch trial]] (1626<U+2013>1631) and the [[Bamberg witch trials]] (1626<U+2013>1631). Over the entire duration of the phenomenon of some four centuries, an estimated total of 40,000 to 60,000 people were executed.

[[Historian]]s and other [[scholar]]s have long debated the reasons for the witch trials. The majority of historians concur that there never were any such organised group of witches.<ref>See for instance [[#Tho73|Thomas 1973]], [[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]], [[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]] and [[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]].</ref>  Mainstream historiography sees the reason for the witch craze in a complex interplay of various factors that mark the [[Early Modern period]], including the religious [[sectarianism]] in the wake of the [[Reformation]], besides other religious, societal, economic and climatic factors. [[Feminism|Feminist]] and [[Neopagan]] authors have however portrayed them as either being an attempt by the [[patriarchal]] authorities to subjugate women,<ref>Anderson, Bonnie S. and Zinsser, Judith P. (1999<U+2013>2000). ''A History of their Own: Women in Europe from Prehistory to the Present''. New York: Oxford University Press. Page 161.</ref> or as the persecution of an actual [[Witch-cult hypothesis|Witch-Cult]], which had been [[paganism|pagan]], rather than satanic, in nature.<ref>See for instance [[#Mur21|Murray 1921]] and [[#Gar54|Gardner 1954]].</ref> Neither of these have been accepted by mainstream historians who have specialised in the subject of the witch trials, such as [[Norman Cohn]], [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]], [[Carlo Ginzburg]], [[Robert W. Thurston]] and Brian Levack.

==Background==
Three developments in Christian doctrine have been identified as factors contributing significantly to the witch hunts: 1) a shift from the rejection of belief in witches to an acceptance of their existence and powers, 2) developments in the doctrine of [[Satan]] which incorporated witchcraft as part of Satanic influence, 3) the identification of witchcraft as heresy. Belief in witches and supernatural evil were widespread in medieval Europe,<ref name="Thurston 2001. p. 15">[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 15.</ref> and the secular legal codes of European countries had identified witchcraft as a crime before being reached by Christian missionaries.<ref name="Hutton 1991 Page 257">[[#Hut91|Hutton 1991]]. p. 257.</ref> Scholars have noted that the early influence of the Church in the mediaeval era resulted in the revocation of these laws in many places,<ref name="Hutton 1991 Page 257"/><ref>"Likewise, the Lombard King Rothari (c. 606-52) decreed in 643 that Christians must not believe that women devour a human being from inside (''ut mulier hominem vivum instrinsecus possit comedere''), and therefore supposed witches (''strigae'') must not be killed, particularly not convicted in court.", Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", p. 30 (2004). Wiley-Blackwell.</ref> bringing an end to traditional pagan witch hunts.<ref name="Hutton 1991 Page 257"/>

Throughout the medieval era mainstream Christian teaching denied the existence of witches and witchcraft, condemning it as pagan superstition.<ref>"Clearly, there was an increase in sceptical voices during the Carolingian period, even if we take into account an increase in surviving sources.", Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", p. 31 (2004). Wiley-Blackwell.</ref> Notable instances include an Irish synod in 800,<ref>"Likewise, an Irish synod at around 800 condemned the belief in witches, and in particular those who slandered people for being ''lamias'' ('''que interpretatur striga''').", Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", pp. 30-31 (2004). Wiley-Blackwell.</ref> [[Agobard|Agobard of Lyons]],<ref>"A Crown witness of 'Carolingian scepticism', Archbishop Agobard of Lyon (769-840), reports witch panics during the reign of Charlemagne. In his sermon on hailstorms he reports frequent lynchings of supposed weather magicians (''tempestarii''), as well as of sorcerers, who were made responsible for a terrible livestock mortality in 810. According to Agobard, the common people in their fury over crop failure had developed the extravagant idea that foreigners were secretly coming with airships to strip their fields of crops, and transmit it to Magonia. These anxieties resulted in severe aggression, and on one occasion around 816, Agobard could hardly prevent a crowd from killing three foreign men and women, perceived as Magonian people. As their supposed homeland's name suggests, the crop failure was associated with magic. The bishop emphasized that thunderstorms were caused exclusively by natural or divine agencies.", Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", pp. 54-55 (2004).

Wiley-Blackwell.</ref> Historian [[Ronald Hutton]] therefore exonerated the early Church from responsibility for the witch hunts, arguing that this was the result of doctrinal change in the later Church.<ref name="Hutton 1991 Page 257"/>

However, Christian influence on popular beliefs in witches and ''maleficium'' (harm committed by magic), failed to eradicate traditional beliefs,<ref>"Study after study has shown how, all over Europe, ordinary people regularly appealed not to their own consciences, or to the conscience of the Church, but to local practitioners skilled in healing, divination, and astrology for help with their everyday problems.

===Medieval persecution of heresy===
{{Main|Medieval Inquisition}}
Whilst the witch trials only really began in the 15th century, with the start of the [[Early Modern period]], many of their causes had been developing during the previous centuries, with the persecution of [[heresy]] by the [[Medieval Inquisition]] during the late twelfth and the thirteenth centuries, and during the [[Late Medieval period]], during which the idea of witchcraft or sorcery gradually changed and adapted. The inquisition had the office of protecting Christian orthodoxy against the "internal" threat of [[heresy]] (as opposed to "external" military threats such as those of the [[Viking invasions|Vikings]], the [[Mongol invasions|Mongols]], and the [[Islamic conquests|Saracens]] or [[growth of the Ottoman Empire|Turks]]).

[[File:Baldung Hexen 1508 kol.JPG|thumb|right|''Witches'' by [[Hans Baldung Grien]] (Woodcut, 1508).]]

During the [[High Middle Ages]], a number of heretical Christian groups, such as the [[Cathars]] and the [[Knights Templar]] had been accused of performing such anti-Christian activities as Satanism, [[sodomy]] and malevolent sorcery in France.  While the nucleus of the Early Modern "witch craze" would turn out to be popular superstition in the  [[Western Alps]], reinforced by theological rationale developed at or following the [[Council of Basel]] of the 1430s, what has been called "the first real witch trial in Europe",<ref>[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 73.</ref> the accusation of  [[Alice Kyteler]] in 1324,  occurred in [[History of Ireland (1169<U+2013>1536)|14th-century Ireland]], during the turmoils associated with the decline of [[Hiberno-Normans|Norman control]].<ref>[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. pp. 73-75.</ref>

Thurston (2001) speaks of a shift in Christian society from a "relatively open and tolerant" attitude to that of a "persecuting society" taking an aggressive stance towards minorities characterized as [[Jews]], [[heretics]] (such as [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]]), [[lepers]] or [[homosexuals]], often associated with [[conspiracy theories]] assuming a concerted effort on the part of diabolical forces to weaken and destroy Christianity, indeed "the idea became popular that one or more vast conspiracies were trying to destroy Christianity from within. The plotters were reputedly financed and abetted by an outside, evil force, often the [[Muslims]]."<ref>[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. pp. 16-18, 32.</ref> An important turning-point was the [[Black Death]] of 1348-1350, which killed a large percentage of the European population, and which many Christians believed had been caused by their enemies. The catalogue of typical charges that would later be levelled at witches, of spreading diseases, committing orgies (sometimes [[incest]]uous), [[Blood libel|cannibalising children]], and following [[Satanism]], emerged during the fourteenth century as crimes attributed to heretics and Jews.

Witchcraft had not been considered a heresy during the High Medieval period. Indeed, since the [[Council of Paderborn]] of 785, the belief in the possibility of witchcraft itself was considered heretical. While witch-hunts only became common after 1400, an important legal step that would make this development possible occurred in 1320, when [[Pope John XXII]] authorized the [[medieval Inquisition|inquisition]] to persecute witchcraft as a type of heresy.<ref>Russell, Jeffrey Burton. ''A History of Medieval Christianity''. Page 173.</ref>

By the late fourteenth century, a number of "witch hunters" began to publish books on the topic, including [[Nicholas Eymeric]], the inquisitor in [[Aragon]] and [[Avignon]], who published the ''[[Directorium Inquisitorum]]'' in 1376.<ref>[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 76.</ref>

===Medieval and Early Modern magic===
{{See|Christian views on magic|Medieval magic|Renaissance magic}}
During the Mediaeval period, there was widespread belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] across Christian Europe, and as the psychologist Gustav Jahoda noted, "the new world as people saw it [in the medieval] included witches, devils, fairies and all kinds of strange beasts&nbsp;... magic and miracles were commonplace."<ref>Jahoda, Gustav (1969). ''The Psychology of Superstition''. London: Allen Lane/Penguin. Page 9-10.</ref> The Mediaeval Roman Catholic Church, which then dominated a large swath of the continent, divided magic into two forms: natural magic, which was acceptable because it was viewed as merely taking note of the powers in nature that were created by [[God]], and demonic magic, which was frowned upon and associated with [[demonology]], [[divination]] and [[necromancy]].<ref>[[#Dav09|Davies 2009]]. p. 22.</ref> This idea of malevolent magic, or ''maleficarum'', was mentioned by historian [[Robert W. Thurston]], who stated that "One of the most persistent features of European world views&nbsp;... was the presence of humans who used magic to help or hurt their neighbours."<ref name="Thurston 2001. p. 15"/>

During the Late Mediaeval and Early Modern periods, magical practice was roughly divided into two forms. The first of these, [[folk magic]], was the form of popular practice widely found amongst common people, comprising largely of simple charms and spells. There were various professionals who performed folk magic in a professional capacity, including charmers, astrologers, fortune tellers, and most importantly, [[cunning folk]]. These were believed to "possess a broader and deeper knowledge of such [magical] techniques and more experience in using them" than the average person, and it was also believed that they "embodied or could work with [[supernatural]] power which greatly increased the effectiveness of the operations concerned."<ref>[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 86.</ref> One of the primary purposes of the cunning folk was in removing curses and other bewitchments that their clients believed that they had suffered, and in this manner cunning folk were in most cases working actively against witchcraft, using such methods as the [[witch bottle]] in order to do so.<ref>[[#Dav03|Davies 2003]]. pp. 103-109.</ref>

The other form of magic was [[ceremonial magic]], followed by those who adhered to philosophies like [[Hermeticism]] and the [[Hermetic Qabalah|Qabalah]]. Whilst the Church disapproved of demonic magic, which was practiced by both certain cunning folk and ceremonial magicians, and condemned it in Early Medieval texts, they did little to actively suppress those that they believed practiced it, not believing them to be any significant threat to Christendom.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

=== Shamanic and animistic influence ===
{{Main|Shamanism in Mediaeval and Early Modern Europe}}
[[File:Witches'Familiars1579.jpg|thumb|A late sixteenth-century illustration of a witch feeding her familiars from England. A number of historians believe that the familiar spirit is a pre-Christian idea.]]
Various historians, namely [[Carlo Ginzburg]], [[<U+00C9>va P<U+00F3>cs]], Gabor Klaniczay and [[Emma Wilby]] have theorised that many elements of Early Modern witchcraft were based upon, or even a continuation of, pre-Christian religious beliefs about visionary journeys that had connections with both [[shamanism]] and [[animism]]. In Early Modern Europe, there was often a belief that witches (and in many cases also [[cunning folk]]), were aided in their performance of magic by supernatural entities known as [[familiar spirit]]s, who appeared in many different forms, usually taking the appearance of either humans or animals.<ref>[[#Wil05|Wilby 2005]]. p. 61.</ref> As historian Ronald Hutton remarked, "It is quite possible that pre-Christian mythology lies behind this tradition",<ref>[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 102.</ref> an idea supported by other historians, such as Wilby.<ref>[[#Wil05|Wilby 2005]].</ref>

In the Early Modern period, it was also widely believed by the prosecutors that the witches travelled to a nocturnal meeting known as the [[Witches' Sabbath]] where they worshipped the Devil, feasted, and committed various Christian sins. Although some historians believe that this was entirely a fictional idea created by the witch hunters, others, having studied the first hand reports given by self-professed or accused witches, have come to the conclusion that these trips to the Sabbath were genuine visionary journeys that some witches believed that they went on. Emma Wilby compares these to similar claims made in the Early Modern period by certain cunning folk that they travelled on a visionary journey into [[Fairy]]land, where they found an assembly led by the King and Queen of the Fairies, feasted, and danced. After making various comparisons with [[ethnography|ethnographic]] and [[anthropology|anthropological]] examples of shamanism in Siberia and North America, she came to the conclusion that both the witches' Sabbath and the Fairyland journeys were visionary experiences undergone by various magical practitioners that likely had their origins in earlier, pre-Christian shamanic ideas.<ref>[[#Wil05|Wilby 2005]]. pp. 84-91.</ref>

Some historians have traced the idea of a visionary nocturnal journey from the Early Modern period into earlier periods of European history that were closer to the pre-Christian era. The fact that such nocturnal journeys containing supernatural entities have been found across Mediaeval and Early Modern Europe, from the [[Benandanti]] of sixteenth century [[Friuli]] in Italy to the supposed [[werewolves]] of Early Modern [[Hungary]]<ref>[[#Poc99|Pocs 1999]].</ref> has led historian [[Carlo Ginzburg]] to believe that they were a part of an "ancient stratum of beliefs" in Europe, that had been found in pre-Christian [[paganism]].<ref>[[#Gin04|Ginzburg 2004]]. pp. 96-97.</ref> Indeed, historian Robert Thurston noted that in the tenth century document, the ''[[Canon Episcopi]]'', the author (likely a Christian monk) described that there were women who, due to a trick of the Devil, had visions that made them think that they met other women at nocturnal meetings to ride in processions led by the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] across "great spaces of the earth". Thurston notes that it was these descriptions of women's nocturnal travels which were "clearly the cultural forerunner of the witches' sabbath."<ref>[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 56.</ref> According to these historians therefore, the idea of the witches' sabbath, along with the similar idea of familiar spirits and the cunning folk's journey to Fairyland, were not developments of the witch hunters but were genuine visionary traditions amongst the European populace, ones with their origins in pre-Christian religion.

===Satan===
[[File:The Obscene Kiss.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''The Obscene Kiss'', an illustration of witches kissing the Devil's anus from Francesco Mario Guazza's ''Compendium Maleficarum'' (1608).]]
It was also during the Medieval period that the concept of [[Satan]], the Biblical [[Devil]], began to develop into a more threatening form. Around the year 1000, when there were increasing fears that the end of the world would soon come in Christendom, the idea of the Devil had become prominent, with many believing that his activities on Earth would soon begin appearing. Whilst in earlier centuries there had been no set depiction of the Devil, it was also around this time that he began to develop the stereotypical image of being animal-like, or even in some cases an animal himself. In particular, he was often viewed as a goat, or as a human with goat-like features, such as horns, hooves and a tail. Equally, the concepts of [[demons]] began to become more prominent, in particular the idea that male demons known as [[incubi]], and female ones known as [[succubi]], would roam the Earth and have sexual intercourse with humans. As Thurston noted, "By about 1200, it would have been difficult to be a Christian and not frequently hear of the devil&nbsp;... [and] by 1500 scenes of the devil were commonplace in the new cathedrals and small parish churches that had sprung up in many regions."<ref>[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. pp. 29-31.</ref>

In the 14th and 15th centuries, the concept of the witch in Christendom underwent a relatively radical change. No longer were they viewed as sorcerers who had been deceived by the Devil into practicing magic that went against the powers of God, as earlier Church leaders like [[Saint Augustine of Hippo]] had stated. Instead they became the all-out malevolent Devil-worshipper, who had made a pact with him in which they had to renounce [[Christianity]] and devote themselves to Satanism. As a part of this, they gained, new, supernatural powers that enabled them to work [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], which they would use against Christians. It was believed that they would fly to their nocturnal meetings, known as the [[Witches' Sabbath]], where they would have sexual intercourse with demons. On their death, the witches<U+2019> souls, which then belonged to the Devil, subsequently went to [[Hell]].<ref>[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. pp. 56-57.</ref>

==History==
===Beginning of the witch hunts during the Fifteenth century===
[[Image:Schiltach Flugblatt.JPG|thumb|300px|1533 account of the execution of a witch charged with burning the [[Germany|German]] town of [[Schiltach]] in 1531]]

While the idea of witchcraft began to mingle with the persecution of heretics even in the 14th century, the beginning of the witch-hunts as a phenomenon in its own right become apparent during the first half of the 15th century in [[Valais witch trials|south-eastern France and western Switzerland]], in communities of the [[Western Alps]], in what was at the time [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]].

Here, the cause of eliminating the supposed Satanic witches from society was taken up by a number of individuals; Claude Tholosan for instance had tried over two hundred people accusing them of witchcraft in [[Brian<U+00E7>on]], [[Dauphin<U+00E9>]] by 1420.<ref>[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 67.</ref>

Soon, the idea of identifying and prosecuting witches spread throughout the neighbouring areas of northern Italy, Switzerland and southern Germany, and it was at [[Basel]] that the [[Council of Basel]] assembled from 1431 to 1437. This Church Council, which had been attended by such anti-witchcraft figures as Johann Nider and [[Martin Le Franc]], helped to standardise the stereotype of the Satanic witch that would be propagated throughout the rest of the trials.<ref>[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 77.</ref>

Following the meeting of the Council and the increase in the trials around this area of central Europe, the idea that malevolant Satanic witches were operating against Christendom began spreading throughout much of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and several adjacent areas. According to historian Robert Thurston, "From this heart of persecution the witch stereotype spread, both through a flood of new writings on the subject and through men who had been at the Council of Basel and now went elsewhere to take up new assignments in the church."<ref>[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 78.</ref> The most notable of these works was published in 1487, written by the German [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monk, [[Heinrich Kramer]] <U+2013> allegedly aided by [[Jacob Sprenger]] <U+2013> known as the ''[[Malleus Malificarum]]'' (''The Hammer of the Witches'') in which they set down the stereotypical image of the Satanic witch and prescribed torture as a means of interrogating suspects. The ''Malleus Malificarum'' was reprinted in twenty-nine editions up till 1669.

On December 5, 1484, Pope Innocent VIII issued the ''[[Summis desiderantes affectibus]]'', a [[papal bull]] in which he recognized the existence of witches and gave full papal approval for the [[inquisition]] to move against witches, including the permission to do whatever necessary to get rid of them. In the bull, which is sometimes referred to as the "Witch-Bull of 1484", the witches were explicitly accused of having "slain infants yet in the mother's womb" (abortion) and of "hindering men from performing the sexual act and women from conceiving" (contraception).<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080523174317/http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/mm00e.html ''The Bull of Innocent VIII''] as published in the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' translated by [[Montague Summers]]</ref>

===Peak of the trials: 1580<U+2013>1630===
The height of the European trials were between 1580 and 1630, with the large hunts first beginning in 1609.<ref name="Thurston 2001 Page 79"/> During this period, the biggest witch trials where held in Europe, notably the [[Trier witch trials]] (1581<U+2013>1593), the [[Fulda witch trials]] (1603<U+2013>1606), the [[W<U+00FC>rzburg witch trial]] (1626<U+2013>1631) and the [[Bamberg witch trials]] (1626<U+2013>1631).

In 1590, the [[North Berwick witch trials]] occurred in Scotland, and were of particular note as the Scottish king, [[James VI]], himself got involved. James had developed a fear that witches planned to kill him after he suffered from storms whilst travelling to [[Denmark]] in order to claim his bride, [[Anne of Denmark|Anne]], earlier that year. Returning to Scotland, the king heard of trials that were occurring in [[North Berwick]] and ordered the suspects to be brought to him <U+2013> he subsequently believed that a nobleman, [[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell]], was a witch, and after the latter fled in fear of his life, he was outlawed as a traitor. The king subsequently set up royal commissions to hunt down witches in his realm, recommending torture in dealing with suspects, and in 1597 he wrote a book about the menace that witches posed to society entitled ''[[Daemonologie]]''.<ref>[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 80-81.</ref>

===Decline of the trials: 1650-1800===
Whilst the witch trials had begun to fade out across much of Europe by the mid seveneenth century, they continued to a greater extent on the fringes of Europe and in the American colonies. In [[Scandinavia]], the late seventeenth century saw the peak of the trials in a number of areas; for instance, in 1675, the [[Tors<U+00E5>ker witch trials]] took place in [[Sweden]], where seventy-one people were executed for witchcraft in a single day. In the nearby [[Finland]], which was then under the control of the Swedish monarchy, the hunt peaked in that same decade.<ref name="Thurston 2001 Page 79"/> During the same period, the [[Salzburg witch trials]] in Austria led to the death of 139 people (1675<U+2013>1690).

The clergy and the intellectuals began to speak out against the trials from the late sixteenth century. [[Johannes Kepler]] in 1615 could only by the weight of his prestige keep his mother from being burnt as a witch. The 1692 [[Salem witch trials]] were a brief outburst of witch hysteria in the New World at a time when the practice was already waning in Europe. Winifred King was the last person tried for witchcraft in New England.{{Citation needed|date=January 2007}}

During the early 18th century, the practice subsided. [[Jane Wenham]] was among the last subjects of a typical witch trial in England in 1712, but was pardoned after her conviction and set free. The last execution for witchcraft in England took place in 1716, when Mary Hicks and her daughter Elizabeth were hanged. [[Janet Horne]] was executed for witch craft in Scotland in 1727. The [[Witchcraft Act of 1735]] saw the end of the traditional form of witchcraft as a legal offence in Britain, those accused under the new act were restricted to people who falsely pretended to be able to procure spirits, generally being the most dubious professional fortune tellers and mediums, and punishment was light.

[[Helena Curtens]] and Agnes Olmanns were the last women to be executed as witches in [[Germany]], in 1738. In Austria, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] outlawed witch-burning and torture in the late 18th century; the last capital trial took place [[Maria Pauer|in Salzburg in 1750]]. In Poland, the [[Doruch<U+00F3>w witch trial]] occurred in 1783 and the execution of additionally two women for sorcery in 1793, trialed by a legal court but with dubious legitimacy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The Historians L. M. Baynes and B. Flower built on the theory of G. liljebakk suggesting that improved diet amongst the common people resulted in a decline of people being accused of witch-craft. Following colonisation of the new world in the 15th and 16th century the import of fruits high in vitamin C such as lemons, limes and pineapples meant there was fewer cases of nutrient deficient diseases such as scurvy. This meant that people where less willing to search for scapegoats regarding their physically deforming conditions, leading to less accusations of witchcraft.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Aftermath: sporadic witch-hunts after 1780===
In the later eighteenth century, witchcraft had ceased to be considered a criminal offense throughout Europe, but there are a number of cases which were not technically witch trials which are suspected to have involved belief in witches at least behind the scenes. Thus, in  1782, [[Anna G<U+00F6>ldi]] was executed in [[Glarus]], [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]], officially for the killing of her infant, a ruling at the time widely denounced throughout Switzerland and Germany as [[judicial murder]]. Like Anna G<U+00F6>ldi, [[Barbara Zdunk]] was executed in 1811 in [[Prussia]] not technically for witchcraft but for arson.

Despite the official ending of the trials for Satanic witchcraft, there would still be occasional unofficial killings of those accused in parts of Europe, such as was seen in the cases of [[Anna Klemens]] in Denmark (1800), [[Krystyna Ceynowa]] in Poland (1836), and [[Dummy, the Witch of Sible Hedingham]] in England (1863). In France, there was sporadic violence and even murder in the 1830s, with one woman reportedly burnt in a village square in [[Nord (department)|Nord]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=Robert Tombs|title=France 1814<U+2013>1914|publisher=[[Longman]]|year=1996|isbn=0582493145|page=245|chapter=Collective Identities: Community and Religion|location=London}}</ref>

The persecution of those believed to perform malevolent sorcery against their neighbours continued right into the twentieth century. For instance, in 1997 two Russian farmers killed a woman and injured five other members of her family after believing that they had used [[folk magic]] against them.<ref name="Thurston 2001 Page 79"/>

==Trials==
[[Image:Matteson Examination of a Witch.jpg|right|thumb|''Examination of a Witch'' by [[T. H. Matteson]]]]

There were extensive efforts to root out the supposed influence of Satan by various measures aimed at the people who were accused of being servants of Satan. To a lesser degree, animals were also targeted for prosecution: see [[animal trial]]. People suspected of being "[[Demonic possession|possessed by Satan]]" were put on trial.  These trials were biased against the alleged witch. On the other hand, the church also attempted to extirpate the superstitious belief in witchcraft and sorcery, considering it as fraud in most cases.

===Regional differences===
The evidence required to convict an alleged witch varied from country to country <U+2013> but prosecutions everywhere were most frequently sparked off by denunciations, while convictions invariably required a confession. The latter was often obtained by extremely violent methods. Although Europe's witch-frenzy did not begin until the late 15th century <U+2013> long after the formal abolition of "[[trial by ordeal]]" in 1215 <U+2013> brutal techniques were routinely used to extract the required admission of guilt. They included hot pincers, the [[Thumbscrew (torture device)|thumbscrew]], and the 'swimming' of suspects (an old superstition whereby innocence was established by immersing the accused in water for a sufficiently long period of time).
Investigators were consequently able to establish many fantastic crimes that could never have occurred, even in theory. That said, many judicial procedures of the time required proof of a causative link between the alleged act of witchcraft and an identifiable injury, such as a death or property damage.

The flexibility of the crime and the methods of proving it resulted in easy convictions. Any reckoning of the death toll should take account of the facts that rules of evidence varied from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and that a significant number of witch trials always ended in acquittal. :"In York, England, at the height of the Great Hunt (1567<U+2013>1640) one half of all witchcraft cases brought before church courts were dismissed for lack of evidence. No torture was used, and the accused could clear himself by providing four to eight "compurgators", people who were willing to swear that he wasn't a witch. Only 21% of the cases ended with convictions, and the Church did not impose any kind of corporal or capital punishment."<ref>[[#Gib98|Gibbons 1998]]. p. 01.</ref>

In the Pays de Vaud, nine of every ten people tried were put to death, but in Finland, the corresponding figure was about one in six (16%). A breakdown of conviction rates (along with statistics on death tolls, gender bias, and much else) can be found in Brian Levack, ''The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe'' (2nd ed, 1995).

There are particularly important differences between the English and continental witch-hunting traditions. The checks and balances inherent in the jury system, which required a 23-strong body (the grand jury) to indict and a 12-strong one (the petit jury) to convict, always had a restraining effect on prosecutions. Another restraining influence was its relatively rare use of torture: the country formally permitted it only when authorised by the monarch, and no more than 81 torture warrants were issued (for all offences) throughout English history.<ref>John H. Langbein, ''Torture and the Law of Proof'' (Chicago and London, 1977), p.81ff.</ref> Continental European courts, while varying from region to region, tended to concentrate power in individual judges and place far more reliance on torture. The significance of the institutional difference is most clearly established by a comparison of the witch-hunts of England and Scotland, for the death toll inflicted by the courts north of the border always dwarfed that of England.<ref>Brian Levack, ''The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe'' (2nd ed, 1995), p.202; see also Christina Larner, ''Enemies of God. The Witch-hunt in Scotland'' (London, 1981), pp.62<U+2013>3</ref> It is also apparent from an episode of English history during the early 1640s, when the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] resulted in the suspension of jury courts for three years. Several freelance witch-hunters emerged during this period, the most notorious of whom was [[Matthew Hopkins]], who emerged out of [[East Anglia]] and proclaimed himself "Witchfinder General".<ref>A detailed account of Hopkins and his fellow witchfinder John Stearne can be found in Malcolm Gaskill's ''Witchfinders: A Seventeenth Century English Tragedy'' (Harvard, 2005). The duo's activities were portrayed, unreliably but entertainingly, in the 1968 cult classic ''Witchfinder-General'' (US: ''Conqueror Worm'').</ref> Such men were inquisitors in all but name, proceeding pursuant to denunciations and torture and claiming a mastery of the supposed science of demonology that allowed for identification of the guilty by, for example, the discovery of  [[witches mark|witches' marks]].

===Interrogation and "proofs"===
Various acts of torture were used against accused witches to coerce confessions and perhaps cause them to name their co-conspirators.  The torture of witches began to grow after 1468 when the Pope declared witchcraft to be "crimen exeptum" and thereby removed all legal limits on the application of torture in cases where evidence was difficult to find.<ref>H.R. Trevor-Roper, ''The European Witch-Craze of The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries and Other Essays,'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1969), 118.</ref>  With the publication of the [[Malleus Maleficarum]] in 1487 the accusations and torture of witches again began to increase, leading to the deaths of thousands.

In Italy, an accused witch was deprived of sleep for periods of up to forty hours. This technique was also used in England, but without a limitation on time.<ref name="Naish p27">Camille Naish, ''Death Comes To The Maiden: Sex and Execution 1431-1933'' (London: Routledge, 1991), 27.</ref> Sexual humiliation torture was used, such as forced sitting on red-hot stools with the claim that the accused woman would not perform sexual acts with the devil.<ref>Henry Charles Lea, ''Witchcraft'', pg 236 as quoted in Camille Naish, ''Death Comes To The Maiden: Sex and Execution 1431-1933'' (London: Routledge, 1991), 28.</ref>

Besides torture, at trial certain "[[evidence (law)|proof]]s" were taken as valid to establish that a person practiced witchcraft. [[Peter Binsfeld]] contributed to the establishment of many of these proofs, described in his book ''Commentarius de Maleficius'' (Comments on Witchcraft).
*The [[diabolical mark]].  Usually, this was a [[Mole (skin marking)|mole]] or a [[birthmark]].  If no such mark was visible, the examiner would claim to have found an invisible mark.
*[[Diabolical pact]].  This was an alleged pact with [[Satan]] to perform evil acts in return for rewards.
*Denouncement by another witch.  This was common, since the accused could often avoid execution by naming accomplices.
*Relationship with other convicted witch/witches
*Blasphemy
*Participation in [[Sabbath (witchcraft)|Sabbaths]]
*To cause harm that could only be done by means of [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]]
*Possession of elements necessary for the practice of [[black magic]]
*To have one or more witches in the family
*To be afraid during the interrogatories
*Not to cry under torment (supposedly by means of the Devil's aid)
*To have had sexual relationships with a demon
[[Image:Wickiana5.jpg|thumb|200px|Burning of three witches in [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]], Switzerland (1585), by [[Johann Jakob Wick]]]]
Legal treatises on witchcraft that were widely referred to in continental European trials include the popular [[Malleus Maleficarum]] (1487) by [[Heinrich Kramer]] and [[Jacob Sprenger]], the ''Tractatus de sortilegiis'' (1536) by [[Paolo Grillandi]] and the ''Praxis rerum criminalium'' (1554) by [[Joos de Damhouder]].

===Executions===
[[Image:Punishing-witches-Laienspiegel.jpg|thumb|240px|Punishments for witchcraft in 16th-century [[Germany]]. Woodcut from Tengler's ''[[Laienspiegel]]'', [[Mainz]], 1508.]]
The sentence generally was death (as Exodus 22:18 states, "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live"). There were other sentences, the most common to be chained for years to the oars of a ship, or [[excommunication|excommunicated]] then imprisoned.

The most common death sentence was to be [[Execution by burning|burnt at the stake]].  In only a few cases were the alleged witches still alive while the stake was set on fire{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.  The garrote was sometimes used in England to execute religious heretics before they were burned at the stake.  In England it was common to [[hanging|hang]] the person first and then burn the corpse, a practice adopted sometimes in other countries (in many cases the hanging was replaced by strangling). [[Drowning]] was sometimes used as a means of execution. England was also the only country in which the accused had the right to appeal the sentence.

The most common methods used to execute alleged witches were [[execution by burning|burning]] and [[hanging]]. The frequent use of 'swimming' to test innocence/guilt means that an unknown number also drowned more or less accidentally prior to conviction. Burning at the stake was common on the Continent as a penalty for heresy, but the common-law jurisdictions of England and colonial America invariably sent people convicted of witchcraft to the gallows. (In a handful of exceptional cases, such as that of [[Giles Corey]] at Salem, alleged witches who refused to plead were pressed to death without trial.)
The measures employed against alleged witches were some of the worst ever to be legally sanctioned in the Western world.

In ''[[A History of Torture]]'', [[George Ryley Scott]] says:

:The peculiar beliefs and superstitions attached to or associated with witchcraft caused those who were suspected of practising the craft to be extremely likely to be subjected to tortures of greater degree than any ordinary heretic or criminal. More, certain specific torments were invented for use against them.

It has been suggested that the execution of persons associated with witchcraft resulted in the loss of much traditional knowledge and folklore, which was often regarded with suspicion and tainted by association.<ref>See Keith Thomas' ''Religion and the Decline of Magic'', first published in 1973.</ref>

====Number of executions====
Ever since the ending of the Witch Hunt, various scholars have estimated how many men, women and children were executed for witchcraft across Europe and North America, with numbers varying wildly depending on the method used to generate the estimate. In the nineteenth century, historians were still unsure as to the exact number, for instance the German folklorist [[Jacob Grimm]] claimed that the number was simply "countless"<ref>[[Jacob Grimm|Grimm, Jacob]] (1883 [1844]). ''Teutonic Mythology'' Volume III. Page 1067.</ref> whilst the Scottish journalist [[Charles Mackay]] believed that it was "thousands upon thousands."<ref>[[Charles Mackay|Mackay, Charles]] (1841). ''Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions'' Volume II. Page 168.</ref> Within several decades, the American suffragette [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] had claimed that nine million women had been killed in the European trials, a figure which would be repeated by a number of later writers such as [[Gerald Gardner]], although it has since been described as having "no rational basis whatsoever" by the professional historian [[Ronald Hutton]].<ref>[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 142.</ref>

In the latter part of the 20th century, as historians began to study the witch trials in greater depth, the estimated number of executions began to be reduced, with the historian [[Norman Cohn]], in ''Europe's Inner Demons'' (1975) criticising claims that they were in the hundreds of thousands, calling these "fantastic exaggerations".<ref>[[Norman Cohn|Cohn, Norman]] (1975). ''Europe's Inner Demons''. Page 253.</ref> Attempting to come to an accurate figure, the historian Brian Levack, author of ''The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe'' (1987), took the number of known European witch trials and multiplied it by the average rate of conviction and execution. This provided him with a figure of around 60,000&nbsp;deaths, however, for the third edition of the work (2006) he later reassessed that number to 45,000.<ref>Levack, Brian (2006). ''The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe'' Third Edition. Longman. Page 23.</ref> This number was criticised as being too low by Anne Llewellyn Barstow, author of ''Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts'' (1994) <U+2013> a work which was derided as un-scholarly and "largely ignored by academics"<ref>Gibbons, Jenny. ''Witchcraze (review)''. Available at summerlands.com/crossroads/remembrance/_remembrance/witchcraze.htm</ref> <U+2013> who herself arrived at a number of approximately 100,000&nbsp;deaths by attempting to adjust Levack's estimate to account for what she believed were unaccounted lost records, although historians have pointed out that Levack's estimate had already been adjusted for these.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Ronald Hutton, in his unpublished essay "Counting the Witch Hunt", counted local estimates, and in areas where estimates were unavailable attempted to extrapolate from nearby regions with similar demographics and attitudes towards witch hunting. He reached an estimate of 40,000 total executions. Table of recorded and estimated executions according to Hutton's estimates<ref>{{Cite web

Assuming 40,000&nbsp;executions over 250&nbsp;years in Europe, which had a population of approximately 150&nbsp;million at the time with a [[life expectancy]] of about 40&nbsp;years, suggests roughly one execution for witchcraft per 25,000&nbsp;deaths, ranking about 3.5 times higher as [[cause of death]] than death by [[capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]] (for any offense) in the [[United States|U.S.]] in the late 20th century,<ref>1,057&nbsp;executions over 30&nbsp;years, compared to some 90&nbsp;million deaths over the same period.</ref>

==Sociology and causes of the European witch-hunts==
[[File:TheWitch-no3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|"The Witch, No. 3", c.1892 by Joseph Baker.]]
One theory for the number of Early Modern witchcraft trials connects the [[counter-reformation]] to witchcraft. In south-western Germany between 1561 and 1670 there were 480 witch trials. Of the 480 trials that took place in southwestern Germany, 317 occurred in Catholic areas, while Protestant territories accounted for 163 of them.<ref name="autogenerated1">H.C. Erik Midelfort, Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany 1562-1684,1972,31</ref> During the period from 1561 to 1670, at least 3,229 persons were executed for witchcraft in the German Southwest. Of this number 702 were tried and executed in Protestant territories, while 2,527 were tried and executed in Catholic territories.<ref>H.C. Erik Midelfort, Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany 1562-1684,1972,31-32</ref> Nineteenth-century historians today dispute the comparative severity of witch hunting in [[Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] territories. <U+201C>Protestants blamed the witch trials on the methods of the Catholic Inquisition and the theology of Catholic scholasticism, while Catholic scholars indignantly retorted that Lutheran preachers drew more witchcraft theory from Luther and the Bible than from medieval Catholic thinkers.<U+201D><ref name="autogenerated1" />

Other theories have pointed out that the massive changes in law allowed for the outbreak in witch trials. Such laws established criteria for determining heretical nature, and punished all aspects. Another theory is that rising number of devil literature popularized witchcraft trials, in which the German market saw nearly 100,000 devil-books during the 1560s.<ref>H.C. Erik Midelfort, Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany 1562-1684,1972,69-0</ref> Another assumption is that climate-induced crop failure and harsh weather was a direct link to witch-hunts. This theory follows the idea that witchcraft in Europe was traditionally associated with weather-making.<ref>[[Wolfgang Behringer]], Witches and Witch-Hunts,2004,88</ref> Scholars also imply that a connection between witchcraft trials and the [[Thirty Years<U+2019> War]] may also have a direct correlation.<ref>H.C. Erik Midelfort, Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany 1562-1684,1972</ref>

While the previously mentioned theories mainly rely on micro level psychological interpretations, another theory has been put forward that provides an alternative macroeconomic explanation.<ref>Gunnar Heinsohn/Otto Steiger: "Witchcraft, Population Catastrophe and Economic Crisis in Renaissance Europe: An Alternative Macroeconomic Explanation.", University of Bremen 2004 [http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/funnyguy_35/6IKSF31.heins-steiger.witchcraft.pdf&date=2009-10-25+22:25:08 (download)]</ref> According to this theory, the witches, who often had highly developed [[midwifery]] skills, were prosecuted in order to extinguish knowledge about [[birth control]] in an effort to repopulate Europe after the population catastrophe triggered by the [[bubonic plague|plague]] pandemic of the 14th century (also known as the [[Black Death]]).<ref>Gunnar Heinsohn/Otto Steiger: The Elimination of Medieval Birth Control and the Witch Trials of Modern Times, International Journal of Women's Studies, 3, May 1982, 193-214</ref> Citing [[Jean Bodin]]'s "On Witchcraft", this view holds that the witch hunts were not only promoted by the church but also by prominent secular thinkers to repopulate the European continent.<ref>Gunnar Heinsohn/Otto Steiger: "Birth Control: The Political-Economic Rationale Behind Jean Bodin's "D<U+00E9>monomanie"", in: History of Political Economy, 31, No. 3, 423-448</ref> By these authors, the witch hunts are seen as an attempt to eliminate female midwifery skills and as a historical explanation why modern gynecology - surprisingly enough - came to be practiced almost exclusively by males in state-run hospitals. In this view, the witch hunts began a process of [[criminalization]] of birth control that eventually led to an enormous increase in birth rates that are described as the "[[population explosion]]" of early modern Europe. This population explosion produced an enormous [[youth bulge]] which supplied the extra manpower that would enable Europe's nations, during the period of [[colonialism]] and [[imperialism]], to conquer and colonize 90% of the world.<ref>Heinsohn, G.(2005):  "Population, Conquest and Terror in the 21st Century."  [http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/funnyguy_35/HeinsohnPopulation.PDF&date=2009-10-25+22:25:15]</ref> While historians specializing in the history of the witch hunts have generally remained critical of this macroeconomic approach and continue to favor micro level perspectives and explanations,<ref>Walter Rummel: 'Weise' Frauen und 'weise' M<U+00E4>nner im Kampf gegen Hexerei. Die Widerlegung einer modernen Fabel. In: Christof Dipper, Lutz Klinkhammer und Alexander N<U+00FC>tzenadel: Europ<U+00E4>ische Sozialgeschichte. Festschrift f<U+00FC>r Wolfgang Schieder (= Historische Forschungen 68), Berlin 2000, S. 353-375, [http://www.historicum.net/themen/hexenforschung/thementexte/rezeption/art/Weise_Frauen/html/ca/b14c768f43/]</ref> prominent historian of birth control [[John Riddle|John M.

Riddle: "The Great Witch-Hunt and the Suppression of Birth Control: Heinsohn and Steiger's Theory from the Perspective of an Historian", Appendix to: Gunnar Heinsohn, Otto Steiger (2004). ''Witchcraft, Population Catastrophe and Economic Crisis in Renaissance Europe: An Alternative Macroeconomic Explanation.''

As this theory has an alternative macroeconomic explanation some scholars oppose it. [[Diane Purkiss]] argues "that there is no evidence that the majority of those accused were healers and midwives; in England and also some parts of the Continent, midwives were more than likely to be found helping witch-hunters.<ref>Diane Purkiss, "A Holocaust of one's own," 8</ref> Also the fact remains that most women used herbal medicines as part of their household skills, and a large part of witches were accused by women.<ref>Diane Purkis, "A Holocaust of one's own," 8</ref>

The modern notion of a "witch hunt" has little to do with [[gender]],{{Dubious|date=September 2010}} the historical notion often did. In general, supposed "witches" were [[female]]. Saith noted [[Judge]] [[Nicholas R<U+00E9>my]] (c.1595), "[It is] not unreasonable that this scum of humanity, [witches], should be drawn chiefly from the feminine [[sex]]." Concurred another judge, "The [[Devil]] uses them so, because he knows that women love carnal pleasures, and he means to bind them to his allegiance by such agreeable provocations."<ref>Klaits, Joseph <U+2014> Servants of Satan: The Age of the Witch Hunts (1985) p.68</ref>

===Gender===
Gender played an important part in the witch trials because on the whole the vast majority of the victims were women. According to the historian R. W. Thurston, 75<U+2013>80% of the victims across both Europe and North America were women,<ref>[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 42.</ref> whilst according to Anne Llewellyn Barstow, 80% of those accused and 85% of those executed in Europe alone were allegedly women.<ref>Barstow, Anne Llewellyn (1994) ''Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts'' San Francisco:Pandora. p. 23</ref><ref name="GibbonsRecent">Gibbons, Jenny (1998) [http://web.archive.org/web/20070203210023/chass.colostate-pueblo.edu/natrel/pom/old/POM5a1.html "Recent Developments in the Study of the Great European Witch Hunt"] in ''The Pomegranate'' #5, Lammas 1998.</ref> Barstow claimed that a combination of factors, including the greater value placed on men as workers in the increasingly wage-oriented economy, and a greater fear of women as inherently evil, loaded the scales against women, even when the charges against them were identical to those against men.<ref>Barstow, Anne Llewellyn (1994) ''Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts'' San Francisco: Pandora.</ref> Thurston saw this as a part of the general [[misogyny]] of the Late Medieval and Early Modern periods,  which had increased during what he described as "the persecuting culture" from that which it had been in the Early Medieval. He noted that at the time, women were generally considered less intelligent and more susceptible to [[sin]] than men, an idea influenced by the character of [[Eve]] in the Bible.<ref>[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 42-45.</ref> Whilst not all of those who condemned witchcraft in this period specifically condemned women as well, there were those who did, for instance, in the ''[[Malleus Malificarum]]'', Sprenger and Kramer stated that:

:All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman&nbsp;... What else is woman but a foe to friendship, an inescapable punishment, a necessary evil, a natural temptation, a desirable calamity, a domestic danger, a delectable detriment, an evil of nature, painted with fair colours!<ref>Kramer and Sprenger. Malleus Malificarum.</ref>

In a few countries however, men accounted for the majority of the accused. In [[Iceland]], for instance, 92% of the accused were men,<ref name="GibbonsRecent" /> and in [[Estonia]] 60% of the accused victims were male, mainly middle-aged or elderly married peasants, and known healers or sorcerers.<ref>Madar, Maia. ''Estonia I: Werewolves and Poisoners''. pp. 257<U+2013>272</ref> Modern scholars agree that the witch hunts cannot be explained simplistically as an expression of male misogyny, as women were frequently accused of witchcraft by other women,<ref>'the theory that witch-hunting equals misogyny is embarrassed by the predominance of women witness against the accused', Purkis, 'The Witch In History', p. 92 (1996); Purkis provides detailed examples, and also demonstrates how some documents have been misread in a manner which attributes accusations or legal prosecution to men, when in fact the action was brought by a woman</ref> and female midwives and <U+2018>white witches<U+2019> were particularly responsible.<ref><U+2018>More numerous than midwives among the accused were women who were engaged in caring for other women<U+2019>s children. Lyndal Roper has shown that many witchcraft accusations in Ausburg in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century arose out of conflicts between mothers and the lying-in maids who provided care for them and their infants for a number of weeks after birth. It was not unnatural for the mothers to project their anxieties about their own health, as well as the precarious health of their infants, on to these women. When some misfortune did occur, therefore, the lying-in maids were highly vulnerable to charges of having deprived the baby of nourishment or of having killed it. What is interesting about these accusations is that they originated in tensions among women rather than between men and women. The same can be said regarding many other accusations made against women for harming young children.<U+2019>, Levack, <U+2018>The Witch-Hunt In Early Modern Europe<U+2019>, p. 140 (2nd edition 1995)</ref><ref name="Gibbons 1998">[[#Gib98|Gibbons 1998]].</ref><ref>'In Lorraine the majority were men, particularly when other men were on trial, yet women did testify in large numbers against other women, making up 43 per cent of witnesses in these cases on average, and predominating in 30 per cent of them.', Briggs, 'Witches & Neighbors: The Social and Cultural Context of European Witchcraft', p. 264 (1998)</ref><ref>'It appears that women were active in building up reputations by gossip, deploying counter-magic and accusing suspects; crystallization into formal prosecution, however, needed the intervention of men, preferably of fairly high status in the community.', ibid., p. 265</ref><ref>'The number of witchcraft quarrels that began between women may actually have been higher; in some cases, it appears that the husband as "head of household" came forward to make statements on behalf of his wife, although the central quarrel had taken place between her and another woman.', Willis, 'Malevolent Nature', p. 36 (1995)</ref><ref>'In Peter Rushton's examination of slander cases in the Durham church courts, women took action against other women who had labeled them witches in 61 percent of the cases.', ibid., p. 36</ref><ref>'J.A. Sharpe also notes the prevalence of women as accusers in seventeenth-century Yorkshire cases, concluding that "on a village level witchcraft seems to have been something peculiarly enmeshed in women's quarrels."14 To a considerable extent, then, village-level witch-hunting was women's work.', ibid., p. 36</ref><ref name="Iceland, Finland p. 39">'The widespread division of labour, which conceives of witches as female, and witch-doctors male, can hardly be explained by Christian influence. In some European countries, like Iceland, Finland, and Estonia, the idea of male witchcraft was dominant, and therefore most of the executed witches were male. As Kirsten Hastrup has demonstrated, only one of the twenty-two witches executed in Iceland was female. In Normandy three-quarters of the 380 known witchcraft defendants were male.', Behringer, <U+2018>Witches and Witch-Hunts: a global history<U+2019>, p. 39 (2004)</ref> It is also recognized that the anti-women agenda of works on witchcraft has been greatly exaggerated.<ref>'On the whole, however, the literature of witchcraft conspicuously lacks any sustained concern for the gender issue; and the only reason for the view that it was extreme and outspoken in its anti-feminism is the tendency for those interested in this subject to read the relevant sections of the Malleus maleficarum and little or nothing else.', Clark, <U+2018>Thinking with Demons: the idea of witchcraft in early modern Europe<U+2019>, p. 116 (1999)</ref>

==Alternate theories==
===The Witch-Cult Hypothesis===
{{Main|Witch-cult hypothesis}}

[[Image:Martin van Maele - La Sorci<U+00E8>re 06.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Illustration by [[Martin van Ma<U+00EB>le]] of a ''[[Witches' Sabbath]]'', in the 1911 edition of Jules Michelet's ''La Sorci<U+00E8>re''.]]

Whilst the Enlightenment-era sociologists and historians had declared the witch trials to be nothing more than mass hysteria, some people in Europe had begun to develop a "totally novel" idea about how these trials had come about. They speculated that, contrary to the established idea, there really had been a cult of practicing witches meeting for secretive religious meetings during the Early Modern period, and that they had been members of a non-Christian religion, which was not Satanic, but a remnant of pre-Christian [[paganism]]. The origins of this theory appeared in 1749, when the Italian [[Girolamo Tartarotti]] published his idea that the image of the Satanic witch had been influenced by surviving pagan iconography, and this same idea was put forth once again in 1844 by the German folklorist [[Jakob Grimm]]. As later historian Ronald Hutton remarked, "Neither [Tartarotti or Grimm], however, supported the notion that those prosecuted as witches were practitioners of a surviving pagan religion, although both were later misquoted as doing so."<ref>[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 137.</ref>

The first author to actually put forward the pagan Witch-Cult hypothesis was the German professor of law [[Karl Ernst Jarcke]], when in 1828 he published the claim that the witch religion, which he treated in a very negative manner, had been originally pagan, but had developed into a form of Satanism as the Christian Church portrayed it as such. Jarcke's ideas were followed by the German nationalist historian Franz Josef Mone, who in 1839 adapted the theory, claiming that the pagan religion that evolved into Satanism was that of Greece rather than his native Germany, a people whom he thought were too civilised to have developed such a "barbaric" religion.<ref>[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 136.</ref>

In 1862, the French historian [[Jules Michelet]] published ''[[Satanism and Witchcraft|La Sorciere]]'', in which he put forth the idea that the witches had been following a pagan religion that opposed the Roman Catholic hierarchy and upper classes.<ref>[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. pp. 137-138.</ref> However, the theory achieved its greatest attention when it was taken up by the Egyptologist [[Margaret Murray]], who published both ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'' (1921) and ''The God of the Witches'' (1931). In these such works, she claimed that the witches had been following a pre-Christian religion devoted to [[fertility]] which she termed "the Witch-Cult" and "Ritual Witchcraft". She claimed that this faith was devoted to a pagan [[Horned God]] whom the Christian authorities had demonised as the Devil, and involved the celebration of four Witches' Sabbaths each year: [[Halloween]], [[Imbolc]], [[Beltane]] and [[Lughnasadh]].<ref>[[#Mur21|Murray 1921]].</ref><ref>[[#Mur31|Murray 1931]].</ref>

Even at the time, various academic historians challenged and dismissed Murray's hypothesis; W.B. Halliday, an expert on ancient religion, for instance noted that her hypothesis relied upon "documents torn from the background of their own age and divorced from the serious study of their historical antecedents."<ref>[[#Hal22|Halliday 1922]].</ref> Later historians and folklorists who were critics of Murray, such as Elliot Rose<ref>[[#Ros62|Rose 1962]].</ref> and [[Jacqueline Simpson]],<ref>[[#Sim94|Simpson 1994]].</ref>  later deconstructed Murray's argument in its entirety and exposed its flaws.

===Neopagan interpretations===
In the early twentieth century, a number of individuals and groups emerged in Europe, primarily Britain, and subsequently the United States as well, claiming to be the surviving remnants of the pagan Witch-Cult described in the works of Margaret Murray. The first of these actually appeared in the last few years of the nineteenth century, being a manuscript that American folklorist [[Charles Leland]] claimed he had been given by a woman who was a member of a group of witches worshipping the god [[Lucifer]] and goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] in [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]]. He published the work in 1899 as ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]''. Whilst historians and folklorists have accepted that there are folkloric elements to the gospel, none have accepted it as being the text of a genuine Tuscan religious group, and believe it to be of late nineteenth century composition.<ref>See for instance [[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. pp. 142-148 and [[#Mag02|Magliocco 2002]].</ref>

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="We Neopagans now face a crisis. As new data appeared, historians altered their theories to account for it. We have not. Therefore an enormous gap has opened between the academic and the "average" Pagan view of witchcraft. We continue to use of out-dated and poor writers, like Margaret Murray, [[Montague Summers]], Gerald Gardner, and Jules Michelet. We avoid the somewhat dull academic texts that present solid research, preferring sensational writers who play to our emotions."|source=Jenny Gibbons (1998)<ref name="Gibbons 1998"/>}}

Subsequently, in 1939, an English occultist named [[Gerald Gardner]] claimed to have been initiated into a surviving group of the pagan Witch-Cult known as the [[New Forest coven]], although modern historical investigation has led scholars to believe that this coven was not ancient as Gardner believed, but was instead founded in the 1920s or 1930s by occultists wishing to fashion a revived Witch-Cult based upon Murray's theories.<ref>[[#Hes04|Heselton 2004]].</ref> Taking this New Forest coven's beliefs and practices as a basis, Gardner went on to found [[Gardnerian Wicca]], one of the most prominent traditions in the [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] religion now known as [[Wicca]], which revolved around the worship of a Horned God and Goddess, the celebration of festivals known as ''Sabbats'', and the practice of ritual magic. He also went on to write several books about the historical Witch-Cult, ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959), and in these books, Gardner used the phrase "the burning times" in reference to the European and North American witch trials.<ref>[[#Gar54|Gardner 1954]]. p. 139.</ref>

In the following few decades, various other Neopagan witches appeared in Britain and the United States claiming that they were the inheritors of the ancient Witch-Cult, including [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Robert Cochrane]], [[Sybil Leek]], [[Charles Cardell]] and [[Victor Anderson (Witch)|Victor Anderson]]. The idea that the Wiccan religion was the continuation of the pagan Witch-Cult which Christian authorities had tried to wipe out during "the burning times" was subsequently popularised by other prominent Wiccans, such as [[Doreen Valiente]], [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]], [[Zsuzsanna Budapest]], [[Raven Grimassi]] and [[Starhawk]], but by the 1980s came to be rejected by a number of Wiccan authors who realised that it lacked a historical basis, such as [[Scott Cunningham]]. Indeed, folklorist Jacqueline Simpson noted in 1994 that "Even the Wiccans are beginning to see how flimsy is the alleged historical evidence for the antiquity and continuation of their 'Old Religion'... many now hold that the factual truth or falsity of the Wiccan view of history is an unimportant question - all that matters is its emotive power as myth and symbol."<ref>[[#Sim94|Simpson 1994]]. p. 95.</ref>

===Feminist interpretations===

Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, various [[feminism|feminist]] interpretations of the witch trials have been made and published. One of the earliest individuals to do so was the American [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]], a writer who was deeply involved in the [[First-wave feminism|first-wave feminist]] movement for [[women's suffrage]]. In 1893, she published the book ''Woman, Church and State'', which was "written in a tearing hurry and in time snatched from a political activism which left no space for original research."<ref name="Hutton 1999 Page 141">[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 141.</ref> Likely influenced by the works of [[Jules Michelet]] about the Witch-Cult, she claimed that the witches persecuted in the Early Modern period were pagan priestesses adhering to an [[Great Goddess hypothesis|ancient religion venerating a Great Goddess]]. She also repeated the erroneous statement, taken from the works of several German authors, that nine million people had been killed in the witch hunt.<ref name="Hutton 1999 Page 141"/>

The next prominent feminist interpretation that saw the trials as a way to persecute women came from the [[Nazi propaganda|propaganda]] of [[Nazi Germany]] during the 1930s. The Nazi propagandists used witches as a symbol of northern ''[[v<U+00F6>lkisch]]'' culture, as opposed to Mediterranean or "Semitic" Christianity. One notable example of this came from [[Mathilde Ludendorff]] in her 1934 ''Christliche Grausamkeit an Deutschen Frauen'' ("Christian cruelty against German women"), where she again repeated the figure of nine million victims.<ref>[[#Bai06|Bailey 2006]]. pp. 236<U+2013>238.</ref>

In 1973, two American second-wave feminists, [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] and [[Deirdre English]], published their own pamphlet examining the witch trials, ''Witches, Midwives & Nurses: A History of Women Healers'', in which they put forward the idea that "the women persecuted as witches had been the traditional healers and midwives of their communities, and that their destruction had not merely been a blow against female power but against (wise and effective) natural medicine and therapies. The witch trials were therefore a victory for both patriarchy and a flawed, male-dominated, modern science."<ref>[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 342.</ref> Although they had initially self-published the work, they received such a positive response that the Feminist Press took over publication, and the work then began worldwide distribution, being translated into French, Spanish, German, Hebrew, Danish and Japanese.<ref>[[#Ehr10|Ehrenreich and English 2010]]. pp. 12-13.</ref>
